ABSTRACT
Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of leukocyte and neutrophil count
as biomarkers in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) undergoing exclusive chemoradiation.
Results: A total of 126 patients were identified. Respectively, 33% and 35%
displayed baseline leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Estimated 3-year OS and PFS from
chemoradiation completion were 31% and 25%, respectively. In univariate analysis,
both leukocytosis and neutrophilia were associated with worse OS, PFS, and LRC
(p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, leukocytosis remained an independent risk factor
associated with poorer OS, PFS and LRC (p < 0.05), independently from tumor stage
and length, with higher prognostic value for OS compared with patients’ performance
status (PS).
Materials and Methods: Bi-institutional clinical records from consecutive nonoperable patients treated between 2003 and 2015 with definitive chemoradiation for
locally advanced esophageal carcinoma were reviewed. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia
were defined as a leukocyte or neutrophil count over 10 G/L and 7 G/L, respectively.
These parameters were studied for their potential correlation with overall survival
(OS), progression free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC) and distant
metastases control (DMC).
Conclusions: Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were independent prognostic factors
of poor OS, PFS, and LRC in this bi-institutional series of locally advanced esophageal
SCC treated with definitive chemoradiation. Although prospective confirmation is
warranted, it is suggested that the leukocyte and neutrophil count parameters might
be clinically relevant biomarkers to be considered for further clinical investigations.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer
worldwide, with an estimated 456,000 new cases in 2012,
and the sixth most common cause of death from cancer with
an estimated 400,000 deaths in 2012, with both incidence
and mortality increasing in the US, whereas the incidence
and mortality of other cancers have decreased [1]. There are
two common histologies of esophageal cancer: squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADK). Both
histological subtypes are usually included in clinical trials,
despite the extensive evidence supporting significant
differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor
biology, and prognosis [2]. To date, the prognosis of
patients with esophageal carcinoma remains particularly
poor with a median progression free survival (PFS) of
9.7 months in the recent phase 2/3-study PRODIGE5/
ACCORD17, despite optimization of the treatment
planning process and integration of systemic agents to
improve treatment efficacy [3]. Identification of new
biomarkers would be therefore crucial, allowing to better
identify patients who might benefit from dose escalation or
intensification of systemic therapies.
Biological pathways involved in inflammation
and immunity play a critical role in tumorigenesis, and
conversely cancer promotes inflammation [4]. Tumorrelated leukocytosis and particularly neutrophilia are a
paraneoplastic syndrome reported in various malignant
advanced tumor types [5]. The expression of cancer cellderived granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
may enhance neutrophilia through an aberrant paracrine
activity and intratumoral chemotaxis of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells [6].
Hematological inflammatory biomarkers are
inexpensive and easy to perform, already used in daily
oncologic practice as part of routine pretreatment
investigations. The systemic inflammatory response,
which is usually measured by peripheral blood-based
parameters such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil,
lymphocyte or platelet count, has been shown to be a
predictive factor in various cancers, including esophageal
[7]. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) seems associated
with tumor progression and poorer survival in patients
with esophageal cancer treated with surgery, but this
finding is controversial in patients undergoing definitive
chemoradiation [8]. However, it is now well documented
that ionizing radiation activates several transcription
factors modulating the expression of mediators in tumor
cells and cells of the microenvironment, which could
explain this inconsistency [9].
Based on the evidence that prognostic stratification
of esophageal carcinoma patients needs to be improved,
this study investigated the prognostic value of leukocyte
and neutrophil count in patients with esophageal SCC
undergoing exclusive chemoradiation in a bi-institutional
retrospective series.

Patients and tumors

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A total of 126 patients with locally advanced
esophageal SCC unsuitable for surgery were included for
analysis. Median age was 62 years (range: 22–86 years).
Median tumor length was 5 cm (range: 1–14 cm). Tumor
length was over 7 cm in 32 patients (25%). One hundred
and twenty-five patients (99%) had locally-advanced
disease defined as T3 tumors (transmural extension), T4
tumors (invasion of adjacent structures), or N1-2 (lymph
node-positive) disease. Patient’s performance status (PS)
were PS 0 or 1 in 109 patients (87%) according to the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification.
On initial blood count, before the first week of
EBRT, median leukocyte and neutrophil counts were
8.7 G/L (2.9–23.3 G/L) and 5.8 G/L (1.1–21.2 G/L),
respectively. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were found in
41 patients (33 %) and 44 patients (35 %), respectively.
Characteristics of patients, tumors and blood cell count
results are shown in Table 1.

Treatment
All patients received thoracic irradiation, delivered
with 3D-conformal technique for 93 patients (74%) and
IMRT for 33 patients (26%). There was no significant impact
of the technique on OS (p = 0.955) or PFS (p = 0.912).
Median total dose to the PTV was 50.4 Gy (22–66 Gy) with
a median treatment duration of 40 days (17–98 days).
Most patients (98 %) received concurrent
chemotherapy, based on FOLFOX in 65 patients (52%),
and 5FU-cisplatin in 37 patients (29%). Eighteen patients
(14%) unfit for these regimens received carboplatin or
cisplatin monotherapy, while 3 patients (2%) received other
regimens (cetuximab in 1 patient, paclitaxel in another
and docetaxel in another). Mean hemoglobin (p = 0.335),
platelet (p = 0.182), leukocyte (p = 0.976), neutrophil (p =
0.925), lymphocyte (p = 0.836) and monocyte (p = 0.931)
counts were not significantly different in patients that
received FOLFOX, 5FU-cisplatin or other regimens. There
was no difference in concurrent chemotherapy regimens
between patients with baseline leukocytosis or neutrophilia
vs. others (p = 0.776 and p = 0.774 respectively). Treatment
characteristics are reported in Table 1.

Outcome
Median follow-up of the whole cohort was 12
months (range: 2 to 127 months), relapses were reported
in 88 patients (70%). Locoregional relapses occurred in
54 patients (43%), distant metastases in 32 patients (25%).
At last follow-up, 81 patients (64%) had died.
Estimated 3-year OS was 31% (95%CI: 23–41%).
Estimated 3-year PFS was 25% (95%CI: 18–35%).

Blood count disorders

Using multivariate analysis, leukocytosis and
neutrophilia were independent factors of poorer OS with
a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.01 and 1.71, respectively. They
were also independently associated with worse PFS (HR
2.35; HR 1.97, respectively) and LRC (HR 1.99; HR
1.68, respectively). Tumor length independently predicted
poorer PFS, LRC and DMC, while higher PS was the only
clinical parameter independently associated with both
poorer OS, PFS, LRC and DMC (Table 2).

Patients who had died from tumor evolution at the
time of analysis had higher initial leukocyte count (p <
0.001), neutrophil count (p < 0.001) and monocyte count
(p = 0.002). No statistically significant difference was seen
regarding hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or lymphocyte
count. Patients with baseline leukocytosis or neutrophilia
displayed a worse initial disease, with higher T-stage (p =
0.030) and tumor length (p = 0.005). Patients with a worse
PS were older (p = 0.022), and had a longer tumor length (p
= 0.027). All correlations between baseline and treatment
characteristics are displayed in Supplementary Figure S1.

DISCUSSION
This study retrospectively evaluated prognostic
factors predicting tumor response and survival in patients
with locally advanced esophageal SCC treated with
exclusive chemoradiation. Poorer outcome was seen in
patients with baseline leukocytosis, even after adjusting
for other factors.
In this population, which clearly needs therapeutic
advances, the challenges are both locoregional and distant
control. Attempts to improve locoregional control with
higher radiation doses, or locoregional and distant control
with concurrent cetuximab or bevacizumab have both
failed [10, 11]. Similarly, there were no clear positive
improvements when comparing concurrent chemotherapy
regimens used. One hypothesis is that these strategies
failed because patients were not sufficiently selected, and
subgroups of patients might potentially benefit, although
these subgroups have still not been identified. Hence, the
importance of determining prognostic factors for patient
stratification.
Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) cancer staging was
developed to describe the anatomic extent of tumors by
Pierre Denoix (Gustave-Roussy Institute) between 1943
and 1952 [12]. Before 1987, tumor length ≤ 5 cm was
categorized as T1-status and > 5 cm as T2-status by the
1983 AJCC TNM staging system for esophageal cancer.
Its prognostic role was predominant in SCC histologies
[12, 13]. Endoscopic tumor length has a significant
impact on both the OS and DMC of patients with resected
esophagus SCC [14]. Surgical reports displayed that depth
invasion of esophageal stratums correlates with tumor
length in SCC [15]. Thus, tumor length was replaced

Prognostic value of leucocyte disorders
In univariate analysis significant factors associated
with worse OS were leukocytosis (p = 0.001), neutrophilia
(p = 0.006), thrombocytosis (p = 0.034), monocytosis
(p = 0.017), higher PS (p < 0.001), T3-4 vs. T1-2 (p =
0.014), and tumor length > 7 cm (p < 0.009). Neither
anemia, lymphopenia, age, gender, tumor localization,
nodal involvement, chemotherapy regimen or radiotherapy
duration significantly predicted OS (p > 0.10). On the
other hand, the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio > 3.5
(NLR) also correlated with worse OS (p = 0.010). At
2-years, estimated OS was 43% (95%CI: 33–56%) for
patients without initial leukocytosis vs. 19% (95%CI: 10–
37%) for patients with initial leukocytosis, and similarly
estimated 2-year OS was 41% (95%CI: 31 - 55%) vs. 24%
(CI95%: 14 - 41%) regarding neutrophilia (Figure 1).
Using univariate analysis, pre-treatment leukocytosis
and neutrophilia were also significant prognostic factors
for PFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). At 2-year
follow-up, estimated PFS was 36% (95%CI: 27–49 %)
for patients without initial leukocytosis vs. 13% (95%CI:
6–30 %) for patients with initial leukocytosis (Figure 2).
Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were also associated
with worse LRC (p < 0.001), and leukocytosis also
predicted worse DMC (p = 0.049). Supplementary Figures
S2 and S3 show respectively locoregional control and
distant metastasis control regarding baseline leukocytosis
or neutrophilia.

with depth of the esophageal wall invasion in the 1987
version of the AJCC TNM staging system and the latest
edition (2010) staged ADK and SCC as two different types

one was recommended to distinguish T1 and T2 disease,
and most of our population had locally-advanced disease
(93% had T3-4 or N1-2). However, the TNM classification
is obviously insufficient for accurately predicting patient
outcome.

Chronic inflammation is essential for cancer growth
and metastasis, and similarly to in systemic diseases,
increased peripheral neutrophil count is associated with
worse outcomes in cancer patients, even in the case of a
localized tumor [16]. Baseline leukocytosis in Chinese
patients with common solid tumors was described in
4–27% of patients, and was associated with a worse
outcome [17]. Yet, the incidence of hematological
abnormalities in Eastern patients with solid tumors is

lower than that of the counterparts in Western countries
[17]. Cancer-related inflammation and neutrophils
suppress antitumor immunity through regulatory
lymphocyte-T cell recruitment, and chemokine activation
[4]. Depending on tumor microenvironment and growth
phase, neutrophils exert protumoral or antitumoral actions
through the production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor,
interleukin-1, and -6) and chemokines, among others [4].
Studies focusing on different cancer types have
identified specific prognostic inflammatory markers,
including the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). GPS, an
inflammation-based prognostic score including serum
CRP and albumin levels, has been reported to be valuable
in combination with conventional staging techniques

to improve the prediction of survival in patients with
inoperable gastro-esophageal cancer [18]. In the context
of chemoradiation for locally advanced esophageal cancer
patients, there is also a correlation between OS and PFS
with changes in NLR and PLR among treatment [19]. This
is also described in patients undergoing chemoradiation
for head and neck SCC [20]. Increased NLR may be
associated with poorer survival in patients with esophageal
cancer, regardless of treatment regimen (surgery alone,
surgery and chemotherapy, chemoradiation), but a metaanalysis displayed that in patients treated with exclusive
chemoradiation, NLR wasn’t associated with outcome
[8, 21]. Our findings evidence that despite a significant
correlation between NLR with OS and PFS in univariate
analysis, this association seems rather related with

neutrophilia than lymphopenia; indeed, lymphopenia was
not associated with OS or PFS in our cohort.
Under inflammatory conditions, monocytes may
also promote tumor cell spreading through circulation
[22]. Classical monocytes promote tumorigenesis and
cancer metastasis, while non-classical “patrolling”
monocytes (PMo) interact with tumors promoting natural
killer cell recruitment, activation, and contribute to cancer
immunosurveillance [23]. In patients with esophageal SCC
treated with curative surgery, higher preoperative absolute
peripheral monocyte count predicts worse OS and DMC,
and a low lymphocyte to monocyte ratio predicts poor
OS [7, 24]. Our findings also highlight that monocytosis
promotes distant relapses. The tumor-monocyteendothelial axis may also represent a new therapeutic
target to reduce cancer metastasis [22]. Enhancement of

PMo-mediated immune blockade therapeutically might
reduce the already metastatic process below a threshold
such that metastasis would not occur [25].
Increased intratumoral and peritumoral neutrophils
associated with poor outcome suggests the possible effect
of immune misbalance of tumor microenvironment in
facilitating esophageal SCC progression, suggesting
that immunotherapy should be considered in the future
[16]. Contrary to the long held belief that chemotherapy
is immunosuppressive, emerging evidence indicates
that the anticancer activity of platinum derivatives also
has important immunomodulatory effects, highlighting
the therapeutic potential of synergistic strategies that
combine conventional chemotherapy with immunotherapy
[26]. Since inflammation and sex steroids also impact
tumorigenesis, a therapeutic approach targeting

glucocorticoid receptors and radiation-induced production
of tumorigenic factors might be effective in sensitizing
SCC to ionizing radiation [9].
The major limitation of our study is its retrospective
design. Bi-institutional analysis and strong associations
between patient outcome and multiple pretreatment
characteristics, including hematological parameters
are strengths of this study, as well as the homogenous
technique used for radiotherapy. To our knowledge, tumor
length, depth of invasion, leukocytosis, neutrophilia,
thrombocytosis, and monocytosis have never been
investigated as predictive data set in patients undergoing
definitive chemoradiation for esophageal SCC. We
evidenced that baseline leukocytosis was the strongest
independent prognostic factor, ahead of PS, TNM, or
tumor length, associated with worse OS, PFS and LRC.
We have not explored it in esophageal adenocarcinomas. If
future studies confirm this prognostic value of leukocytosis
is histologically dependent, it would be of interest to
further define the mechanisms of this phenomenon. The
next step is to confirm these data in an independent cohort
before translating these results to the clinic. However, if
validated, these biomarkers might be used for adaptive
strategies in order to improve patient outcome.

endoscopic findings plus a 1.5 cm radial margin and 4–5
cm craniocaudal margin (in case of tumor extension into
the stomach, a distal margin of 3 cm) plus the GTV N of
involved nodes on PET-CT with a 1 cm margin (CTV N).
Reduction boost volume CTV 2 was defined from GTV T
plus a 1 cm radial margin and a 2 cm craniocaudal margin.
Two planning target volumes (PTVs) were defined, PTV
1 and PTV 2, by adding a uniform 1cm margin to CTV
1 and 2, respectively. Patients received external beam
radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prescribed doses 40–41.4 Gy
(in 20–23 fractions of 1.8–2 Gy/fraction) to the PTV 1 and
50–66 Gy (at 1.8–2 Gy/fraction) to the PTV 2.
Most patients treated before 2014 underwent a
3D conformal technique using multiple fields with high
megavoltage photons generated by a linear accelerator.
Those treated after 2014 underwent intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) with a simultaneous integrated
boost (SIB). All patients underwent 3D planning. Organs
at risk (OARs) were the spinal cord, the heart, and the
lungs. All OARs were delineated to allow the generation
of dose-volume histograms and calculation of maximumtolerated doses. Treatment was performed with a linear
accelerator of at least 6 MV with an isocentric technique.
The prescription dose was specified at the ICRU50/62
reference point, which was the isocenter for most patients.
The daily prescription dose was 1.8–2 Gy at the ICRU
reference point. The 95% isodose line encompassed
the entire PTV, and the maximum dose to the PTV did
not exceed the prescription dose by > 7% (ICRU 50/62
guidelines).
Radiotherapy started on the first day of the first
chemotherapy cycle. Patients received concurrent
chemotherapy, with four cycles (two concomitant to
radiotherapy) of fluorouracil 1000 mg/m² per day for 4
days and cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 1 (5FU-cisplatin)
before 2014, and six cycles (three concomitant to
radiotherapy) of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m², leucovorin 200
mg/m², bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m², and infusion
fluorouracil 1600 mg/m² over 46 h (FOLFOX) after 2014,
in accordance to the state of the art [3]. Patients unfit for
these regimens were treated with concurrent platinum
based monotherapy or other regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tumors
We examined clinical records of consecutive patients
treated in 2 French institutions (Gustave Roussy Cancer
Campus, Villejuif, France; Paoli-Calmettes Institute,
Marseille, France) between April 2003 and August 2015
for histologically confirmed non-operable esophageal SCC,
treated with definitive chemoradiation. Data extraction was
performed independently in each institution.
Clinical work-up included upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy with histologic biopsy and endoscopic
ultrasonography; computed tomography (CT) exploring
cervical, thoracic, and abdominal regions; positronemission tomography-CT (PET-CT); and external
ultrasonography of the neck with fine-needle aspiration of
lymph nodes when cancer was suspected. Disease staging
was defined according to the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) Esophagus and Esophagogastric
Junction staging manual, 7th edition [27]. Tumor length
was defined by endoscopic ultrasound or CT (whichever
was larger). Excluded patients were metastatic, those with
a history of prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and those
treated with a palliative intention by hypofractionated
chemoradiation.

Complete blood count analysis
Patients underwent systematic complete blood cell
counts weekly during chemoradiation. Pretreatment blood
samples taken before any chemotherapy were employed
in the current analysis. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia,
defining biological inflammation, were defined as blood
count over 10 G/L and 7 G/L, respectively. Anemia
was defined as hemoglobin count below 12.0 g/dL;
thrombocytosis as platelet count over 400,000 /mm3;
lymphopenia as lymphocyte count below 1,000 /mm3;
and monocytosis as monocyte count over 1,000 /mm3.
We excluded from the analysis patients who received

excluded patients with a history of neoplasia or medication
which may confound the analysis (G-CSF, antibiotics for
a recent infection).

Follow-up and statistical analysis
Follow-up was scheduled at 6 weeks, then every
three months during two years, then every 6 months.
Systematic CT exploring cervical, thoracic, and abdominal
regions, and PET-CT were performed 3 months after
CRT completion, then every six months. Differences in
patient characteristics regarding baseline neutrophilia
were compared by student’s t-test, chi-2 and by variance
analysis. A correlation matrix was constructed using
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Factors associated
with tumor relapse were examined. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for
quantitative variables to determine the best cut-off point
values discriminating between groups with good or poor
prognosis and to define the distinctions between groups
with differing prognosis. Survival times were defined
as the time between diagnosis and the last follow-up or
first event (time of death for OS, recurrence or death for
progression free survival [PFS], locoregional recurrence
for locoregional control [LRC] and distant metastasis
[DM] for distant metastasis control [DMC]) estimated by
the Kaplan Meier method. Survival curves were compared
using log-rank and the Cox univariate hazards model.
Multivariate analyses were performed for variables with
p value < 0.20 in univariate analysis, according to Cox
multivariate proportional hazards model. In multivariate
analysis, leukocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were
tested in different models, as they are a subpopulation of
leucocytes. Statistical analyses were performed using
RStudio (2015) (RStudio: Integrated Development for
R. RStudio, Inc. Boston, MA; URL http://www.rstudio.
