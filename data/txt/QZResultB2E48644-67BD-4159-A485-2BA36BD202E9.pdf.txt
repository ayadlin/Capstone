ABSTRACT
Repeat tumor biopsies to study genomic changes during therapy are difficult,
invasive and data are confounded by tumoral heterogeneity. The analysis of circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) can provide a non-invasive approach to assess prognosis and
the genetic evolution of tumors in response to therapy. Mutation-specific droplet
digital PCR was used to measure plasma concentrations of oncogenic BRAF and NRAS
variants in 48 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma prior to treatment with
targeted therapies (vemurafenib, dabrafenib or dabrafenib/trametinib combination)
or immunotherapies (ipilimumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Baseline ctDNA levels
were evaluated relative to treatment response and progression-free survival (PFS).
Tumor-associated ctDNA was detected in the plasma of 35/48 (73%) patients prior
to treatment and lower ctDNA levels at this time point were significantly associated
with response to treatment and prolonged PFS, irrespective of therapy type. Levels of
ctDNA decreased significantly in patients treated with MAPK inhibitors (p < 0.001) in
accordance with response to therapy, but this was not apparent in patients receiving
immunotherapies. We show that circulating NRAS mutations, known to confer
resistance to BRAF inhibitors, were detected in 3 of 7 (43%) patients progressing on
kinase inhibitor therapy. Significantly, ctDNA rebound and circulating mutant NRAS
preceded radiological detection of progressive disease. Our data demonstrate that
ctDNA is a useful biomarker of response to kinase inhibitor therapy and can be used
to monitor tumor evolution and detect the early appearance of resistance effectors.

INTRODUCTION

progression. Furthermore, we evaluated the ctDNA for the
presence of mutations associated with resistance to BRAF
inhibitor therapy.

Most melanomas display aberrant activation of
the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
[1], most frequently via oncogenic mutations affecting
BRAF and NRAS [2]. BRAF mutations commonly result
in the substitution of the valine at codon 600 for glutamic
acid (V600E; 80%), lysine (V600K; 12%), methionine,
arginine or aspartic acid (each 4-5%) [3-6]. BRAFV600mutant melanomas are exquisitely sensitive to BRAF
inhibitors such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib, which
alone or in combination with a MEK inhibitor improve the
overall survival of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma patients
[7-10]. Despite these therapeutic advances approximately
50% of melanoma patients treated with BRAF and MEK
inhibitors will progress within 12 months. Resistance
usually involves MAPK reactivation, often via mutations
affecting NRAS or MEK, mutant BRAF gene amplifications
or alternative BRAF splicing [11-13]. Acquired resistance
mechanisms differ between and within patients and also
exhibit intra-tumoral heterogeneity [11, 12].
In addition to targeted therapies, recent clinical
trials have demonstrated the efficacy of reactivating antitumor immune responses by targeting inhibitory immune
receptors. Monoclonal antibodies against the CTLA-4
receptor (ipilimumab) and the PD-1 receptor (nivolumab
and pembrolizumab) show remarkable long-term benefits
in the 10% and 40% of patients who respond, respectively
[14-17]. These immunotherapies show delayed activity,
and tumor regression can occur after initial tumor
enlargement [18, 19]. Altogether the above underscores
the need for better prognostic markers and early indicators
of response to treatment.
The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can
provide valuable prognostic information and reveal tumor
genetic changes, including the acquisition of resistanceconferring mutations during therapy in a variety of cancers
[20-24]. In melanoma, the quantity of tumor associated
mutant BRAF ctDNA correlated with tumor burden, and
lower concentrations of basal mutant BRAF ctDNA were
associated with a higher overall response rate and longer
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with
BRAF inhibitors [25, 26]. More recently, Lipson et al.
showed that levels of ctDNA correlated with radiological
outcomes in a small group of melanoma patients treated
with immunotherapies [27]. Similarly Tsao et al. showed
changes in ctDNA levels in six patients treated with
different immunotherapy modalities that reflected changes
in their disease status [28].
In this study we analysed the ctDNA in BRAF
and NRAS-mutated melanoma patients at baseline (n =
48) and within 8 weeks of treatment initiation (n = 25)
to determine whether ctDNA correlates with treatment
response and clinical benefit. We also analysed the
dynamic changes in ctDNA in response to MAPK
inhibitors and immunotherapies during response and after
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
Baseline ctDNA levels are associated with
treatment response and PFS
We quantified the amount of ctDNA in 48 patient
plasma samples collected at baseline, i.e. 0-2 weeks prior
to treatment initiation. ctDNA was detectable in 22 of
34 cases (65%) with BRAFV600E tumors (one requiring a
different probe as the patient carried a 1799-1800 TG >
AA mutation), in 7 out of 8 patients with BRAFV600K and in
all cases with BRAFV600R (n = 2) and NRASQ61K/R/L (n = 4)
tumors. Detectable ctDNA levels ranged from 1.6-57,302
copies/ml. Interestingly a significant correlation was found
between the concentration of ctDNA and plasma LDH
activity (n = 26, r = 0.76, p < 0.0001) (Supplementary
Figure 1).
Of the 48 cases analysed in this study, 29 were
treated with MAPK inhibiting therapies (24 dabrafenib/
trametinib, 4 vemurafenib and 1 dabrafenib monotherapy)
while 19 were treated with immunotherapies (9 with
ipilimumab, 3 with nivolumab, 6 with pembrolizumab
and 1 with a combination of ipilimumab/pembrolizumab).
Patients that responded to targeted therapy had
significantly lower baseline ctDNA than non-responders
(median, 10.5 versus 1695 copies/ml, p = 0.042, MannWhitney U-test) (Figure 1A). Of note, all cases with <
10 copies/ml of ctDNA at baseline (n = 12) responded
to therapy. However this association was not statistically
significant possibly due to the limited number of nonresponders. Patients receiving immunotherapy that
responded to treatment also had significantly lower
baseline ctDNA than non-responders (median, 5 versus
87.2 copies/ml, p = 0.049, Mann-Whitney U-test) (Figure
1B). Moreover, baseline ctDNA ( < 10 copies/ml) was
significantly associated with response to immunotherapy
(p = 0.009, Relative risk 5, 95% CI 1.8-13.8).
Similarly, targeted therapy treated patients with
PFS longer than 6 months had significantly lower median
baseline concentrations of ctDNA compared to those
with PFS less than 6 months (1 versus 725 copies/ml, p =
0.008, Mann-Whitney U-test) (Figure 1C). Low baseline
ctDNA levels were associated with longer than 6 month
PFS (p = 0.0057, RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9). Patients
receiving immunotherapy with PFS longer than 6 months
also had significantly lower baseline ctDNA compared
to those with less than 6 months PFS (median, 5 versus
87.2 copies/ml, p = 0.049, Mann-Whitney U-test) (Figure
1D). Moreover, baseline ctDNA ( < 10 copies/ml) was
significantly associated with 6 months PFS (p = 0.009,

Table 1: Factors associated with PFS in patients treated with targeted therapies

Relative risk 5, 95% CI 1.8-13.8).
In a Cox regression analysis, patients on targeted
therapy with ≥10 copies/ml of ctDNA at baseline had a
significantly shorter PFS compared to patients that had
< 10 copies/ml of ctDNA (p = 0.008, Hazard ratio =
4.6, 95% CI, 1.5-14.1) (Figure 1E). A multivariate Cox
regression analysis revealed that the predictive value of
low baseline ctDNA on longer PFS in patients treated
with MAPK inhibitors remained significant (p = 0.027)
and independent of sex, age, tumor stage or LDH levels
(Table 1). Low ctDNA levels ( < 10 copies/ml) were also
statistically significant associated with longer PFS for
patients treated with immunotherapies (p = 0.034, Hazard
ratio = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-12.5) (Figure 1F).
Overall these results suggest that low baseline
ctDNA is a good predictor of response to treatment and
longer PFS. Notably, of the 32 cases with high baseline
ctDNA levels, 17 responded to therapy and 12 had a
PFS longer than 6 months, suggesting that low baseline
ctDNA ( < 10 copies/ml) is predictive, but not an absolute
indicator of treatment outcome and clinical benefit.

Two patients (one treated with vemurafenib and one
with nivolumab) defined as non-responders, also had a 10fold reduction in ctDNA levels (marked with asterisks in
Figure 2B and 2D). Both of them had prolonged stable
disease for greater than 6 months, suggesting that the
treatment had some effect on tumor activity, reflected in
the decreasing ctDNA levels. One of these patients was
treated with nivolumab and had evidence of progressive
disease at first scan. The patient received second modality
treatment with radiotherapy to an enlarging chest wall
lesion and continued treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody.
He achieved ongoing disease control for greater than
6 months. This atypical pattern of response has been
described in 4% of patients in the early nivolumab trials,
where subsequent response is observed after having
progressive disease (PD) on initial assessment [29, 30].

Changes in ctDNA levels in melanoma patients
during therapy and at progression
We monitored ctDNA level in four patients, treated
with dabrafenib/trametinib as first line therapy (Figure 3
A-3D). In all four patients a dramatic decline in ctDNA
concentrations was recorded within 1-3 weeks after
commencing treatment, decreasing to undetectable levels
in 3 patients by 6 weeks. However, ctDNA rebounded in
all cases prior to, or at the time of, detection of progressive
disease by CT scans. In particular, in patient #17 (Figure
3B) a clear recurrence of tumor burden was apparent by
ctDNA analysis at 30 weeks after treatment initiation,
however the radiological analysis classified the disease
status as stable at that time with progression only noted at
39 weeks. All four patients were treated with ipilimumab
after failing the MAPK inhibitor therapy, but none
responded to immunotherapy. The presence of ctDNA
remained detectable during and after immunotherapy.
Of note, a patient that experienced complete
response to treatment (Figure 3E), developed a solitary
brain metastasis of 18 millimetres at week 22, but ctDNA
rebound was not detected in plasma sampled prior to

Decrease in ctDNA after therapy initiation
A subgroup of 25 patients (10 on MAPKi and 15 on
immunotherapy) with detectable ctDNA at baseline was
also sampled between 4 to 8 weeks after therapy initiation.
The concentration of plasma ctDNA significantly
decreased in most patients after therapy initiation
compared to baseline concentrations. This decrease (which
ranged from 100-1000 fold reduction) was more apparent
amongst patients treated with and responding to MAPK
inhibitors (p = 0.0071) (Figure 2A). By contrast, there
was no apparent decrease in ctDNA, within a similar time
frame, in most patients receiving immunotherapies (Figure
2C and 2D). Of note, only 4 of the 15 immunotherapytreated patients analysed in this subgroup, responded to
treatment (Figure 2C). A 10-fold reduction in ctDNA was
observed in 2 of these 4 responders, while the other 2 had
a low baseline ctDNA concentration, and this remained
low, but detectable, 6 weeks later.

stereotactic radiosurgery at week 27. This observation
may question the utility of ctDNA quantification in the
case of brain metastases, consistent with previous studies
suggesting that the blood-brain barrier may prevent ctDNA
from entering the circulation [20].

However, mutant NRAS ctDNA was consistently detected
at lower quantities than BRAF mutant ctDNA. Of note,
in patient #17 the escape mutation NRASQ61K could be
detected from week 20, however no progressive disease
was apparent by radiological scan at week 30 (Figure
3B), once again supporting the value of ctDNA analysis
for monitoring melanoma patients undergoing systemic
therapies.

Detection of acquired resistance mutations in
ctDNA

DISCUSSION

Mutations in NRAS have been found in 8-26% of
patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors [11,
13]. We analysed the presence of NRASQ61K and NRASQ61R
in the ctDNA extracted from 7 melanoma patients with
progressive disease who had previously responded
to treatment with vemurafenib (n = 2) or dabrafenib/
trametinib (n = 5). Two samples were positive for
NRASQ61K and one sample had an NRASQ61R mutation, all
three were derived from patients treated with dabrafenib/
trametinib.
For all three positive cases the presence of NRAS
mutations was evaluated in longitudinally collected
samples (Figure 3B-3D, Supplementary Figure 2). No
mutated NRAS was detectable prior to treatment initiation
(baseline) or prior to ctDNA rebound. The amount of
mutant NRAS ctDNA increased as the BRAF mutant
ctDNA rebounded and both fluctuated in a similar pattern.

Our results demonstrate that quantification of plasma
ctDNA is a valuable tool for monitoring tumor dynamics
in metastatic melanoma patients. The quantity of ctDNA
in plasma tracks the patient’s response to treatment and
precedes radiological disease progression. Moreover we
demonstrate, for the first time, that mutations conferring
resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors can be detected in
the ctDNA of patients undergoing targeted therapies, prior
to radiological evidence of progression.
Due to logistics of sample collection and transport,
plasma samples used in the study were derived from
blood processed 16-24 hours after collection. Although
most protocols for the analysis of ctDNA recommend
plasma separation within 2-4 hours [31], the agreement
of our ctDNA quantities with clinical status indicated that

the ctDNA was not compromised in these samples. We
have also shown that plasma processing within 4 hours of
blood collection did not significantly alter the amount of
tumor associated ctDNA relative to processing at 24 hours
(Supplementary Figure 3).
We found that low baseline ctDNA ( < 10 copies/
ml) was predictive of prolonged PFS compared to patients
with a high baseline ctDNA, particularly in patients treated
with targeted therapies, supporting previous reports [25,
26]. Of note, the predictive value of ctDNA levels on PFS
by Cox regression analyses remained significant at various
cut-off values from 10-300 copies/ml (data not shown),
including 216 copies/ml as described in a recent study by
Sanmamed et al. [26]. However, all patients with baseline
ctDNA < 10 copies per ml responded to therapy and had
more than 6 month PFS, thus supporting 10 copies per
ml as a biologically significant and data driven threshold,
which was not apparent when 216 copies/ml was used as
a classifier. Importantly, although a substantial proportion
(14/17; 82%) of cases with > 10 ctDNA copies per ml
responded to therapy, all rapidly progressing patients (PFS
< 6 months) had high ctDNA ( > 10 copies/ml) at baseline.
Significantly, we found that independent of baseline
ctDNA levels, a decrease in ctDNA within 8 weeks after
treatment initiation was associated with response to
therapy. Thus, monitoring ctDNA early during therapy
may provide long-term patient response information that
can inform the timing for second line therapy initiation.
Limitations of this study include the small sample
size especially of patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors and the heterogeneity of the treatments given
within this group which are known to have different modes
of action and treatment response rates. Future studies are
needed to evaluate the predictive value of baseline ctDNA
in patients treated with particular immune checkpoint
blockade modalities. Moreover, additional studies are
required to evaluate the dynamic changes in ctDNA that
provide early reliable prediction of treatment response.
In particular it will be important to determine whether a
decrease in ctDNA after initiation of immunotherapies
provides a predictive measure of clinical benefit in patients
with a delayed response.
Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA during treatment
clearly demonstrated that ctDNA levels closely track
clinical disease status. More importantly, a rebound
in ctDNA levels correlated with treatment failure, and
in at least one case preceded radiological detection of
progressive disease. Future studies with more regular
collection of plasma samples during therapy will confirm
whether rebound of ctDNA generally precedes radiological
detection of progression.
One of the most important findings of this study
was the identification of acquired resistance via NRAS
mutations in patients that initially responded to targeted
therapy and subsequently progressed. To our knowledge
this has not been previously reported for melanoma,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and in the setting of tumor tissue heterogeneity, could
identify the most important resistant clone to direct
further treatment selection. For example in the LOGIC 2
study (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02159066) where patients
are biopsied at progression and a second line treatment
selected based on the genetic analysis of the biopsy, results
can be confounded by inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity.
We show here that blood monitoring could be utilised
to identify the most significant clone at resistance and
confirm that it was not detectable at baseline.
Detection of acquired resistance mutations through
ctDNA analysis has been previously demonstrated in
colorectal cancer with the evolution of mutant KRAS to
EGFR blockade [22]. Subsequent studies identified, by
whole genome plasma DNA sequencing, the development
of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies through KRAS
amplification and polysomy of chromosome 12p [32,
33]. Similarly, the resistance–conferring mutation EGFR
T790M could be detected in plasma of lung cancer
patients following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib
[24, 34]. Altogether these results underscore the utility of
ctDNA analysis for non-invasive detection of treatment
failure and the development of resistance.
The frequency of patients progressing on BRAF/
MEK inhibitors with NRAS mutations (43%) was larger
than in any other studies, especially for treatment with
dabrafenib/trametinib combination [30]. This could reflect
the small number of patients analysed, but it is tempting
to speculate that NRAS mutations were more commonly
detected here because ctDNA is derived from the sum
of a patient’s tumors. Previous studies profiling acquired
resistance in melanoma, examined individual progressing
lesions, which are known to display intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms [11, 12]
[35]. Circulating mutant NRAS presumably originates from
a subset of the melanoma burden, and this is supported by
the fact that NRAS mutant ctDNA was consistently lower
than the BRAF mutated ctDNA.
Overall these data confirm that measuring tumorassociated ctDNA is a valuable and simple method to
track patient response, tumor evolution and resistance
acquisition.

A1799-FAM V600E (6FAM-TAGCTACAGAGAAATCMGBNFQ),
AA1799-1800-FAM
V600E2
(6FAMTAGCTACAGAAAAATC-MGBNFQ)
or
AA1798-1799-FAM
V600K
(6FAMTAGCTACAAAGAAATC-MGBNFQ). The following
primers were used for both assays: 5’- CTACTGTTTTCC
TTTACTTACTACTACACCTCAGA-3’ (forward) and
5’-ATCCAGACAACTGTTCAAACTGATG-3’ (reverse).
Probes and primers were custom synthesised by Life
Technologies. NRAS mutations Q61K and Q61R were
tested using the commercial PrimePCR mutation assays
(BioRad).
Droplets were generated and analysed using the
QX200 system (Bio-Rad). Amplifications were performed
using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95°C for 10
minutes, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds and 55°C for
1 minute, and 1 cycle of 98°C for 10 minutes. A positive
control, a healthy control and a no template control were
included in each run. QuantaSoft version 1.6.6 analysis
software (Bio-Rad) was used for data acquisition and
analysis. Only tests providing more than 10,000 droplets
were used for analysis. The number of copies of mutated
DNA per 20 µl reaction was extrapolated to calculate
copies per ml using the following equation:
Copies/ml of plasma = C*EV/TV/PV.
PV = Volume of plasma used for cfDNA extraction
(ml)
EV = Volume in which cfDNA was eluted (µl)
TV = Volume of cfDNA added to the PCR reaction
(µl)
C = copies/20µl (data derived from QuantaSoft)
To facilitate graphical representation and statistical
analysis, samples with no detectable ctDNA were given
a value of 1 copy per ml. Control samples derived from
plasma of age matched healthy individuals were used to
determine the specificity of each assay (Supplementary
Table 2). Most samples were tested only once against each
mutation due to the limited amount of cfDNA available
for analysis. We showed in a subset of 20 samples the
reproducibility of the assay (Supplementary Figure 4).

Patient treatment and follow up
Patients were treated with either vemurafenib,
dabrafenib/trametinib
combination,
ipilimumab,
nivolumab, pembrolizumab or ipilimumab/pembrolizumab
at the currently approved doses. Patients underwent
baseline assessment including medical history, physical
examination, and radiologic tumor assessment with
computer tomography (CT) or positron emission
tomography (PET) scans. Patients were treated at the
discretion of their treating oncologist as appropriate
for their disease stage, mutational status and Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
Patients underwent clinical assessment at least monthly,
including a physical examination and assessment of
biochemical parameters. Tumor responses were assessed
radiologically at two to three month intervals. CT scans
were assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria [36] and classified
as having a complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Patient
information and samples collected are indicated in the
Supplementary Table 1.

Plasma collection and cell free DNA extraction
Patient peripheral blood samples were collected
in EDTA vacutainer tubes, stored at 4°C, and processed
within 24 hours of being drawn. Blood samples were
centrifuged at 1600g for 10 min for plasma collection,
followed by a second centrifugation for further plasma
clearance. Plasmas were stored at -80°C until extraction.
The cell free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from 1-5 ml
of plasma using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
cfDNA was eluted in AVE buffer (Qiagen). DNA samples
were stored at -80 °C until analysis.

Statistical analysis
PFS was defined as the time from the date of
initiating therapy to the date of first reported PD or
censored at the most recent visit. Baseline ctDNA was
tested for association with overall response and 6-month
PFS using one-sided Mann-Whitney U test.
The ctDNA data was dichotomised in order to
determine the best cut-off value to discriminate between
groups of responders or non-responders, as well as those
with PFS of more or less than 6 months (6mo PFS).
Comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact tests.
The reported p-values have not been adjusted for multiple
comparisons.
Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression

ctDNA quantification
The ctDNA was quantified by droplet digital PCR.
Amplifications were carried out in a 20 µL reaction
containing 1× droplet PCR supermix, 250 nM of each
probe, 900 nM primers and 5 or 8 µL cfDNA. Samples
were analysed for BRAF-V600E or V600K mutations
depending on the mutation identified in the patient
biopsy. The following probes were used: T1799-VIC
WT (VIC-CTAGCTACAGTGAAATC-MGBNFQ) and
