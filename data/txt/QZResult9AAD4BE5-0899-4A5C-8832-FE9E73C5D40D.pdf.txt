BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus in the treatment of patients with
nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) or pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed nonfunctioning NETs or pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas and with documented disease progression before study enrollment were eligible for the current study. Everolimus was administered daily at a dose of 10 mg for 4 weeks. Response was assessed
by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.0) every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the 4-month progression-free survival rate (PFSR). The hypothesis of the current study was that the 4-month PFSR would increase from 50% to 65%.
Safety was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). RESULTS:
A total of 34 patients were enrolled. Of these, 27 patients had nonfunctioning NETs, 5 had pheochromocytomas, and 2 had paragangliomas. The 4-month PFSR was 78%. Partial response (PR) was observed in 3 patients. Twenty-eight patients had stable disease
(SD) and 2 patients developed progressive disease (PD). The response rate (RR) and overall disease control rate (DCR) were 9.0%
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0%-18.6%) and 93.9% (95% CI, 85.8%-100%), respectively. The PFS was 15.3 months (95% CI, 4.6
months-26.0 months). Of the patients with nonfunctioning NETs, 3 achieved a PR and 23 had SD (RR, 11.1%; DCR, 100%); the PFS was
17.1 months (95% CI, 11.1 months-23.0 months) and the 4-month PFSR was 90.0%. Twenty-one patients (80.8%) demonstrated tumor
shrinkage. In 7 patients with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas, 5 achieved SD, and 2 developed PD. The PFS was 3.8 months
(95% CI, 0.5 months-7.0 months) and the 4-month PFSR was 42.9%. Four patients demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The major grade
3/4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (14.7%), hyperglycemia (5.9%), stomatitis (5.9%), and anemia (5.9%). CONCLUSIONS:
Everolimus was associated with high therapeutic efficacy and tolerability in patients with nonfunctioning NETs, and demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent a heterogeneous group of tumors that are characterized by their ability to
secrete peptides. This group includes gastrointestinal NETs, islet cell tumors, medullary thyroid carcinomas, small cell
lung carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and Merkel cell carcinomas. Among these, the most common
site of origin is the gastroenteropancreatic lesion. Although NETs are rare tumors, an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database has shown an increase of the incidence of NETs in the United States.1 Between
1975 and 2004, an approximate 5-fold increase was reported. It is interesting to note that the number of NETs in all sites
has increased. The exact reasons for this are unknown but may include improved diagnostic techniques, cancer screenings
being performed more frequently, and some environmental factors.2,3
The biology of NETs is dependent on several factors, including the primary tumor site, degree of differentiation,
and tumor grade.4,5 NETs can be divided into functioning and nonfunctioning tumors based on whether they secrete hormones, which causes clinical symptoms. The management of NETs can vary according to histology, grade, extent of disease, and the involved sites. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, grade 3 NETs are known
to have an aggressive clinical course. The treatment strategy for these types of NETs has been similar to that of small cell

lung cancer. In contrast, well-differentiated to moderately
differentiated NETs (grade 1 or 2 according to the WHO
classification) can be managed differently. Some cases of
indolent, low-volume, asymptomatic, advanced NETs
can be followed without treatment until there is evidence
of disease progression or until symptoms develop. The
treatment of patients with progressive disease (PD), disease-related symptoms, or a high disease burden varies
according to tumor subtype. Patients with localized NETs
primarily receive local treatments such as surgery. Surgical
resection or hepatic artery embolization are also useful for
hepatic metastases of NETs.6
With the advent of octreotide, an octapeptide that
mimics natural somatostatin and is a potent inhibitor of
growth hormones, glucagon, and insulin, the control of
hormonal symptoms caused by functioning NETs has
been greatly improved because the majority of NETs
express somatostatin receptors.7 Octreotide long-acting
release (LAR) has been shown to have antitumor effects as
well as hormonal symptom control. In patients with
advanced, well-differentiated carcinoid tumors occurring
in the midgut, this drug has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo,
regardless of the functioning status of the tumors.8
However, to the best of our knowledge, aside from
octreotide, no satisfactory systemic antitumor treatment
options are available. The effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on well-differentiated or moderately differentiated
NETs has been minimal,9,10 and immunomodulating
agents have not been useful.11
Recently, new insights regarding the pathogenesis of
NETs have come to light. The high expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor
(VEGFR) in NETs has led to trials examining the effect
of antiangiogenic agents on NETs. Sunitinib, a smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has been found to
improve PFS and overall survival in patients with well-differentiated pancreatic NETs compared with placebo in a
phase 3 clinical trial.12
Another important pathway in NETs is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The
mTOR pathway stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and
angiogenesis. Autocrine activation of the mTOR signaling
pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor 1,
has been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic
NET cells.13 The effect of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, on low-grade or intermediate-grade pancreatic NETs
was evaluated in a phase 3 trial (RAD001 in Advanced
Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial [RADIANT-3]).
Cancer

Everolimus significantly improved PFS compared with
placebo.14 Everolimus, in combination with octreotide
LAR, has also been studied in a phase 3 trial (RADIANT2) of low-grade or intermediate-grade NET (carcinoid)
with a history of secretory symptoms attributable to carcinoid syndrome.15 Compared with placebo plus octreotide
LAR, everolimus plus octreotide LAR was found to
improve PFS in patients with advanced NETs associated
with carcinoid syndrome.
However, to the best of our knowledge there have
only been rare reports that focused on the therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitor monotherapy (without octreotide LAR) in the population of patients with only
nonfunctioning NETs, including all primary sites
throughout the body.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare
NETs with an estimated prevalence of between 1:6500
and 1:2500. These lesions arise from adrenal chromaffin
cells or similar types of cells in extraadrenal sympathetic
and parasympathetic paraganglia.16 Nearly all pheochromocytomas and sympathetic extraadrenal paragangliomas
as well as approximately 20% of head and neck paragangliomas produce, store, metabolize, and secrete catecholamines or their metabolites. Thus, pheochromocytomas
and paragangliomas are found in approximately 0.05% to
0.1% of patients with sustained hypertension. Systemic
treatment has rarely been reported in cases of malignant
unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.
The current study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus monotherapy (without
octreotide LAR) for the treatment of nonfunctioning
NETs regardless of tumor origin, especially pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study was a multicenter, single-arm, open-labeled phase 2 study. A total of 8 centers participated. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
all participating centers and was registered with the
United States National Library of Medicine (ClinicalTrials.gov) as NCT01152827.
Patient Eligibility Criteria

The following inclusion criteria were used for patient
selection 1) histologically or cytologically confirmed nonfunctioning NETs, pheochromocytomas, or extraadrenal
paragangliomas; 2) local, locally advanced, or metastatic
disease documented as having demonstrated PD by a scan
(computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or technetium [99mTc] sestamibi [MIBI])

taken 2 to 12 months before the baseline compared with a
previous scan taken at any time in the past (PD had to
have been documented according to Response Evaluation
Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria); 3) lesions
that were not amenable to surgery, radiotherapy, or combined modality therapy; 4) at least 1 measurable lesion
(based on RECIST criteria [version 1.0]); 5) age > 18
years; 6) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0,1; and 7) adequate
organ function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 
1500 cells/lL; platelet count  100,000 cells/lL; hemoglobin  9.0 g/dL; serum creatinine  1.5  the upper
limit of normal [ULN]; serum bilirubin  1.5  ULN;
and aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and alkaline phosphatase  2.5 
ULN [if liver metastasis existed,  5  ULN]). Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. Important exclusion criteria were 1) functioning NETs; 2)
prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within 4
weeks before enrolling in the study except for palliative
radiotherapy for the treatment of nontargeted lesions
(within 2 weeks before entering the study); 3) intestinal
obstructions or impending obstructions; 4) recent upper
gastrointestinal bleeding; and 5) cardiac arrhythmia
(grade  2), atrial fibrillation of any grade, or a QTc
interval > 450 milliseconds for males or > 470 milliseconds for females.
Treatment

Everolimus was given at a dose of 10 mg daily without
interruption. The cycles were repeated every 28 days. The
cycles were delayed until the following criteria were satisfied: ANC > 1500 cells/lL, platelet count > 75,000
cells/lL, and nonhematologic toxicity related to the everolimus returning to baseline levels or  grade 1. Treatment was discontinued for patients with PD, individuals
who experienced unacceptable adverse events (AEs), or
patients who withdrew their consent.
Dose Adjustments

Ten mg of everolimus per day was the starting dose for all
patients entering the study. Lower dose levels were 5 mg
daily and 5 mg every other day subsequently. Everolimus
therapy was discontinued if a patient was unable to tolerate the drug at a dose of 5 mg every other day or if drugrelated toxicity required treatment interruption for > 21
days. Everolimus administration was interrupted for
patients with grade 3 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities (based on the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE],
version 3.0) and resumed at 1 dose level lower after toxic6164

ity was reduced to grade 1 (except hyperlipidemia). Everolimus was permanently discontinued for patients who
developed NCI CTCAE grade 4 toxicities, except for
individuals with grade 4 neutropenia, in which case the
toxicity was managed with treatment interruption and
dose reduction. In addition, dose reduction was required
for patients with grade 2 pneumonitis.
Assessment of Therapeutic Efficacy and Toxicity

Tumor responses were assessed every 8 weeks or earlier in
patients with suspected PD based on the RECIST criteria.
CT scans were performed at least 4 weeks after the first
scan to confirm complete responses (CRs) and partial
responses (PRs).
The primary endpoint for measuring treatment efficacy was the 4-month PFS rate (PFSR). PFS was defined
as the time between the initiation of treatment and PD or
death by any cause. Secondary endpoints for evaluating efficacy included response rates (RRs), disease control rates
(DCRs), time needed to observe the responses, response
duration, and overall survival rates. The duration of
response was measured from the time that measurement
criteria were met for a CR or PR (whichever was recorded
first) until the first date that disease recurrence or PD was
objectively documented. Overall survival was estimated
from the date of the first treatment to patient death or the
date of the last follow-up visit.
We also evaluated metabolic responses with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographyCT (PET-CT) after 8 weeks of treatment if possible. PET
response (also defined as the metabolic response) was
measured at the same time point (after 8 weeks of treatment) as the CT scan according to the recommendations
of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET Study Group.17 Complete resolution of FDG uptake within the tumor so that
it was indistinguishable from surrounding normal tissue
was considered to represent a metabolic CR. A metabolic
PR was defined as a reduction of  25% in tumor FDG
uptake. An increase in tumor standardized uptake values
(SUVs) of  25% within the region of interest defined by
the baseline scan, or the appearance of new FDG uptake
in another region of the tumor, was classified as metabolic
PD. Metabolic stable disease (SD) was classified as an
increase in the tumor SUV of < 25% or a decrease of <
25%. Safety was assessed according to the NCI CTCAE.
Statistical Analysis

The main purpose of the current study was to assess the
4-month PFSR. The H0 (null hypothesis) predicted a
4-month PFSR of 50%, whereas the H1 (alternative

hypothesis) predicted a 4-month PFSR of 65%, a type I
error of 5% (1-sided), and 80.0% power. The rationale
for this hypothesis was based on our previous study of
patients with metastatic/recurrent NETs.5 The time-todisease progression after first-line systemic treatment was
6.0 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.3
months-8.7 months) and that after second-line and thirdline systemic treatment was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.5
months-6.5 months) and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.5
months-2.5 months), respectively. Because the majority
of the patients who were eligible for the current study had
a high probability of pretreatment with other kinds of systemic agents, we set the H0 as a 4-month PFSR of 50%.
Because we expected that everolimus could improve the 4month PFSR by 30%, we set the H1 as a 4-month PFSR
of 65%. To test these hypotheses, 29 patients were
required for the study. When we assumed a 15% dropout
rate, we determined that a total of 33 patients needed to
be enrolled.
Survival and all safety analyses were performed on
the intention-to-treat population. The objective response
was assessed on the per-protocol population. Follow-up
began at the outset of treatment. The censoring event for
responses was the start of PD. The censoring event for survival was death. Overall survival and PFS were analyzed
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival results were
expressed as the median value with the 95% CI.

Patient Characteristics

A total of 34 patients were enrolled in the current study
between February 2007 and August 2010. The data cutoff
was April 2011. The baseline characteristics of the patients
are shown in Table 1. The median age of the patients at
the time of study entry was 56 years (range, 29 years-73
years). Twenty-one patients (61.8 %) were male. Fourteen patients had an ECOG performance status of 0.
Twenty-seven patients (79.4%) had nonfunctioning
NETs, 5 patients (14.7%) had pheochromocytomas, and
2 patients (5.9%) had paragangliomas. All patients had
metastatic disease. There were 4 metastatic sites in 2
patients, and 3 metastatic sites in 6 patients.
The time elapsed since initial diagnosis to study
entry ranged from 6 months to 2 years in 15 patients
(44.1%) and from 2 years to 5 years in 11 patients
(32.4%). No patient with a pheochromocytoma and
paraganglioma received prior iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) therapy.

Response to Treatment and Survival Rates

Metabolic Response Evaluation

Among 33 the patients who were evaluated, objective
responses were observed in 3 (0 CRs and 3 PRs), for an
overall RR of 9.0% (95% CI, 0%-18.6%). Twenty-eight
patients (84.8%) had SD. The overall DCR was 93.9%
(95% CI, 85.8%-100%). PD was observed in 2 patients
(6.0%) (Table 2). As shown in Figure 1 using a waterfall
plot (Fig. 1), 25 patients (75.6%) demonstrated tumor
shrinkage. The median PFS was 15.3 months (95% CI,
4.6 months-26.0 months) and the 4-month PFSR was
78% (Fig. 2). This exceeded the rate noted in our hypothesis, which stated that treatment with everolimus would
increase the 4-month PFSR from 50% to 65%. At the
time of the data cutoff, no deaths had occurred. The median duration of treatment was 6.2 months (range, 1.1
months to > 30.6 months).
Among the 27 patients with nonfunctioning NETs,
3 achieved a PR and the remaining patients had SD (RR,
11.5%; overall DCR, 100%) with a median PFS of 17.1
months (95% CI, 11.1 months-23.0 months) and a 4month PFSR of 90.0%. Twenty-one patients (80.8%)
demonstrated tumor shrinkage. The median duration of
response was 6.4 months (95% CI, 0.2 months-12.6
months). The median duration of treatment was 6.7
months (range, 1.1 months to > 30.6 months).
In individuals with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas, 5 patients achieved SD and 2 developed PD. The
median PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 0.5 months-7.0
months) and the 4-month PFSR was 42.9%. A reduction
in tumor volume was noted in 4 patients. The median duration of treatment was 3.8 months (range, 1.1 months8.3 months).

Baseline PET-CT was performed in 16 patients. The median SUV of these patients was 4.95 (range, 1.6-8.3).
PET-CT was performed 8 weeks after treatment in 15
patients. The median SUV of the posttreatment PET-CT
was 3.40 (range, 1.3-14.5). Both pretreatment and posttreatment PET-CT scans were performed in 14 patients.
Among these patients, 5 (35.7%) had achieved a metabolic PR, 5 patients (35.7%) had metabolic SD, and 4
patients (28.6%) developed metabolic PD. Table 3 shows
the detailed data for all 14 patients. The 8-week metabolic
response was found to be highly correlated with the CT
response. Among the patients demonstrating SD
with CT, patients with metabolic PRs tended to have a
longer PFS.

Safety

Hematologic and nonhematologic AEs are summarized in
Table 4.
The most common AEs (all grades) were rash
(29.4%), diarrhea (26.5%), anorexia (20.6%), stomatitis
(17.6%), and fatigue (17.6%). The major grade 3/4 AEs
were thrombocytopenia (14.7%), hyperglycemia (5.9%),
stomatitis (5.9%), and anemia (5.9%). There were no
treatment-related deaths reported.
DISCUSSION
Everolimus monotherapy was examined in patients with
nonfunctioning NETs and pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal paragangliomas. The median PFS for all patients
was 15.3 months and that for patients with nonfunctioning NETs was 17.1 months.

NETs represent a very heterogenous group of
tumors and patients with progressive NETs have limited
treatment options. Recently, in 2 phase 3 studies of
patients with pancreatic NETs, sunitinib and everolimus
improved PFS mainly via disease stabilization.12,14 In the
interim, there is the huge therapeutic challenge posed by
NETs that originate from sites other than the pancreas.
The combination of everolimus and octreotide has been
tested in a phase 3 trial (RADIANT-2) of low-grade or intermediate-grade NETs (carcinoid) in patients with carcinoid syndrome.15 The functional status of NETs has been
regarded as a prognostic factor. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first using mTOR inhibitor
monotherapy (without octreotide) to focus only on
patients with nonfunctioning NETs originating from all

sites (colorectal, adrenal, lung, and stomach) along with
pheochromocytomas and extraadrenal paragangliomas.
The RADIANT-2 trial enrolled patients with NETs
originating from the small intestine (52%), lung (10.2%),
colon (6.5%), pancreas (6.0%), liver (4.1%), and other
sites. Except for pheochromocytomas and extraadrenal
paragangliomas, the origin of the tumors is similar to the
current study. However, all patients in the RADIANT-2
trial had a history of secretory symptoms (diarrhea or
flushing) attributable to carcinoid syndrome and all
patients in the current study had nonfunctioning tumors.
In patients with functioning NETs, the PFS with placebo
plus octreotide LAR was 11.3 months and the treatment
benefit with everolimus plus octreotide LAR was recorded
regardless of the primary tumor site.15
The PFS of 17.1 months for patients with nonfunctioning NETs who were treated with everolimus in the
current study was good when compared with the PFS of
16.4 months for patients with functioning NETs who
were treated with the combination of everolimus and
octreotide.15 In the current study, none of the patients
received the concomitant octreotide.
The incidence of pheochromocytoma/extraadrenal
paraganglioma is very low, and the majority of cases are
benign. However, some are clinically malignant. The incidence of malignant pheochromocytoma/extraadrenal paraganglioma ranges from 3% to 36%, depending on the
genetic background and tumor localization. Some of these
tumors are diagnosed as malignant at the time of initial
presentation whereas others are diagnosed after surgical
removal of the primary tumor, which initially was clinically benign, due to malignant transformation (in other

words, cases of recurrent disease). Cases of malignant pheochromocytoma/extraadrenal paraganglioma are currently defined by the presence of metastases but not local
invasion. To our knowledge, no large trial published to
date has examined pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal paragangliomas because of the low incidence of these lesions.
The benefit of everolimus monotherapy was
observed in the current study regardless of the origin of
the primary tumor. However, patients with pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal paragangliomas were found to have
6168

a shorter PFS than those with nonfunctioning NETs.
Among the 7 patients with pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal paragangliomas, 4 demonstrated a tumor volume
reduction even though this was less than was noted in
patients who achieved a PR. Of these 4 patients, 1 patient
developed PD due to the appearance of a new lesion.
Therefore, when taken together, it appears that everolimus has an effect on pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal
paragangliomas.
In a recent report, the majority of patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas were found to not respond to cytotoxic
chemotherapy, and the effect of chemotherapy on overall
survival appeared to be small.18 Nevertheless, to our
knowledge there have been very few studies published to
date regarding targeted therapy for pheochromocytomas/
extraadrenal paragangliomas. The studies that have been
performed included a very small number of patients. For
example, 1 study included only 4 patients who received
everolimus whereas others included a very limited number
of patients (or only 1 patient) who were treated with sunitinib.19-22 Therefore, the effect of everolimus on pheochromocytomas/extraadrenal paragangliomas should be
investigated further.
Several mechanisms may influence the enhanced
glucose uptake in cancer cells, including upregulation of
glucose transporters and increases in hexokinase activity
and the protein kinase B, also called Akt, which appears to

play a key role in the control of glucose metabolism together with proteins that are involved in the signal cascade
pathway, such as mTOR.23 Changes in tumor metabolism caused by the mTOR inhibitor have been examined
using FDG-PET. It has been shown that decreases in tumor FDG uptake can be observed as early as 24 hours after the administration of a single dose of temsirolimus in a
murine model of renal cell cancer.24 In addition, metabolic changes elicited by everolimus and noted on PET
are closely linked with the antitumour activity of everolimus. FDG uptake measured by PET can be used as a surrogate marker to determine the optimal biological dose of
an mTOR inhibitor in vivo soon after the initiation of
therapy.25 In 1 pilot study, FDG-PET was found to be a
valuable tool for evaluating the early pharmacodynamic
effects of mTOR inhibition in patients with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the goal of this
proof-of-principle study was to explore FDG-PET as a
pharmacodynamic tool for everolimus therapy in patients
with NSCLC rather than to evaluate early metabolic
response as a predictor of outcome.26
In the current study, we evaluated the metabolic
response after 8 weeks of treatment using FDG-PET, and
analyzed the correlation between the metabolic response
and morphologic responses assessed by RECIST. To do
this, we followed the recommendations of the EORTC
PET Study Group.17 The pretreatment SUV was relatively
low compared with that of other common types of solid tumor, which reflected the less aggressive nature of NETs.
Among the 14 patients who underwent pretreatment and
posttreatment PET, 5 (35.7%) demonstrated a metabolic
PR and 5 (35.7%) had metabolic SD. In addition, 4
patients (28.6%) developed metabolic PD. These results
indicate that the 8-week metabolic response was highly correlated with the CT response. Furthermore, among the
patients with a SD-CT response, patients with a PR-PET
response had a tendency toward a longer PFS than those
with SD-PET or PD-PET responses. This result suggests
the possibility of metabolic response by FDG-PET as a
candidate for predicting clinical outcome. However, the
application of FDG-PET to daily practice in patients with
NET should be considered with caution before it is validated in further prospective large-scale clinical trials.
In some cases of targeted agents, there are ethnic differences noted with regard to metabolism. Thus, differences in safety or even efficacy have been reported.27 The
toxicities observed in the current study are similar to those
noted in previous reports. However, the incidences of
rashes of all grades and stomatitis were lower than those of
the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-2 trials.14,15 In those

trials, the incidences of stomatitis and rashes of all grades
were 64% and 49%, respectively, in the RADIANT-3
trial and 62% and 37%, respectively, in the RADIANT-2
trial. In the current study, the incidences of stomatitis and
rashes of all grades were 17.6% and 29.4%, respectively.
Reported grade 3/4 stomatitis and rashes were similar in
all 3 studies: 5.9% and 0%, respectively, in the current
study; 7% and < 1%, respectively, in the RADIANT-3
trial; and 7% and 1%, respectively, in the RADIANT-2
trial. However, the incidence of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was higher in the patients in the current study
(14.7%) compared with those in the RADIANT-3 trial
(4%) and RADIANT-2 trial (5%). The incidence of
hyperglycemia among patients in the current trial, RADIANT-3 trial, and RADIANT-2 trial was also similar. The
increases in AST/ALT were somewhat higher among
patients in the current study (all grades: 14.7%) compared
with the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-2 trials (< 10%).
However, there were no patients with a grade 3/4 elevation in AST/ALT. Everolimus can reactivate patients with
the hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses. Thus, liver enzymes
should be monitored carefully when using this compound, especially in areas in which the hepatitis B virus is
endemic. The differences in incidence or grade between
some adverse events observed in the current study and the
RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-2 trials cannot be
explained solely by ethnic differences. In a Japanese trial
of everolimus monotherapy for the treatment of patients
with advanced gastric cancer, the incidences of all grades
of stomatitis and rashes were 73.6% and 45.3%, respectively.28 Further study is needed to clarify the reported
differences in safety between study populations.
In the current study, we enrolled patients with nonfunctioning NETs to compare the results with those of
the RADIANT-2 trial. Although the patients in the current study did not have the secretory symptoms, such as
diarrhea or flushing, attributable to carcinoid syndrome,
they may have had different symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and so on. Twenty patients (58.8%) had an ECOG
performance status of 1 at the time of study entry. Therefore, the change in quality of life during the study period
is important. We did not collect data regarding quality of
life from patients using variable symptom questionnaires.
However, we believe that this should be considered in
future studies of NETs. The duration of follow-up was
not sufficient to collect overall survival data. After the data
cutoff, during posttreatment follow-up, 3 patients died (2
with pheochromocytomas and 1 with a NET). Two
patients with pheochromocytomas whose best responses
were both PD died after 3 months and 10 months off

treatment, respectively. One patient with a nonfunctioning NET whose best response was SD died after 7 months
off treatment.
We determined that everolimus is a promising and
well-tolerated agent for the treatment of patients with nonfunctioning NETs regardless of the primary origin of the
tumor. This drug demonstrated modest efficacy in patients
with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas. Early metabolic responses measured by 18F-FDG PET were found to
be highly correlated with CT responses. The results of the
current study support the further study of everolimus in
patients with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas and
the incorporation of PET into NET studies.
