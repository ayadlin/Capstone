BACKGROUND: Nasal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rare. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal DLBCL. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were
included in the study. All patients received combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. RESULTS:
Patients with nasal DLBCL usually were older and were predominantly men with early stage disease, low frequency
of B symptoms and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), good performance status, and a low-risk international
prognostic index (IPI) score. The overall response rate after initial treatment was 76%, the 3-year overall survival (OS)
rate for the whole group was 44%, and the median OS was 35 months. Performance status and IPI were significant
prognostic factors for OS. For patients with IPI scores of 0 or 1, the 3-year OS rate was 54%, and the median OS was
52 months compared with 17% and 11 months, respectively, for patients with IPI scores of 2 or 3 (P ¼ .033). The prognosis for patients who achieved a complete response (CR) was significantly better than that for patients who did not
achieve a CR. Extranodal spread was the primary pattern of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated
that primary nasal DLBCL appears to have distinct clinical features; its poor outcome and propensity for extranodal

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents a heterogeneous disease that depends mainly on the primary site
of involvement.1-5 Patients with DLBCL that arises in different sites display a large variety of pathobiologic and clinical
findings, which justify the identification of different variants and subtypes.4,8-10 In contrast to lymphomas of the Waldeyer ring or paranasal sinuses, which are predominantly diffuse large B-cell lymphomas,11-13 nasal lymphomas are mainly
of a natural killer (NK)/T-cell origin,14-18 and primary nasal DLBCL is extremely rare. Because of the rarity of this condition, few studies have addressed it as a separate entity: Most reports have included a mixture of NK/T-cell and B-cell lymphomas or have reported nasal DLBCL along with lymphomas of the paranasal sinuses or other upper aerodigestive tract
locations.11-13,19-23 Most previous reports have consisted of only small case series.20,24 Therefore, to date, the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with primary nasal DLBCL have not been defined. Furthermore, the treatment
options for primary nasal lymphomas have been based on extrapolation from the experience with lymph node DLBCL or
nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, so the optimal therapy for nasal DLBCL has yet to be determined.11-14 The objective of this
study was to address the clinical features, pathways of tumor spread, and treatment outcomes in patients with nasal
DLBCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility and Evaluation
The study group consisted of 25 patients with previously
untreated nasal DLBCL who presented at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking
Union Medical College, Beijing, China between 1999 and
2009. They accounted for 10% of all patients with nasal
lymphoma who presented during this period. Primary nasal
lymphoma was defined according to primary symptoms and
the location of the majority of bulky tumor in the nasal cavity, as indicated previously.25,26 For patients who had lymphoma involving both the nasal cavity and adjacent
structures, primary location was based on an objective assessment of the tumor center as measured by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All
diagnoses were confirmed by typical morphologic features
and immunophenotypic evaluation. Immunohistochemical
studies were positive for B-cell markers, such as cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) (pan-B-cell antigen) and/or CD79a
(immunoglobulin-a0), and were negative for T-cell or NK/
T-cell markers, which included CD2 (cell surface antigen),
CD3 (protein complex), CD45RO (cell surface antigen),
and CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule). Markers of germinal-center (GC) B-cell or activated B-cell-like subtypes,
such as CD10 (neutral endopeptidase), B-cell lymphoma 6
protein (Bcl-6), and the multiple myeloma oncogene-1
(MUM-1), which have become available in recent years,
were used to evaluate 12 patients in the latter part of this series. According to the algorithm published by Hans et al,27 5
patients had a GC subtype, and 7 patients had a non-GC
subtype. Patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas or B-cell
lymphomas of the paranasal sinuses or extranasal upper aerodigestive tract were excluded from this study.
The Ann Arbor system was used for staging, which
was based on the available records. Staging procedures
included a clinical history; physical examination with
fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy; complete blood counts
with serum biochemistry; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH);
chest radiograph; CT scans and/or MRI of the head and
neck; CT scans and/or MRI of the thorax, abdomen, and
pelvis; and bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. The international prognostic index (IPI) score was calculated for
each patient as described previously.28

Treatment
Chemotherapy was the primary treatment for nasal
DLBCL. All patients received combination chemotherapy, which consisted of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,

1594

vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP-like chemotherapy with or without rituximab, with or without
involved-field radiotherapy. Overall, 17 patients received
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and 8 patients received
chemotherapy alone. Rituximab combined with chemotherapy was received by the 10 most recent patients.
Patients received a median of 5 cycles of chemotherapy.
Radiotherapy was received by patients who had early
stage disease and those who had progressive or residual
disease after chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to
the primary tumor was 46 grays (Gy) (range, 40-56 Gy) at
2 Gy per fraction. The clinical target volume included the
nasal cavity and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally and the ipsilateral maxillary sinuses and was extended to cover adjacent
organs if involved.
Statistical Analysis
Treatment outcome was evaluated using the international
workshop response criteria for lymphomas.29 Overall survival (OS) was measured from the start of initial treatment to
the date of death from any cause or to the date of last followup. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the
date of initial treatment to the date of disease progression, recurrence, or death from lymphoma or other causes. Survival
was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival
curves were compared by using the log-rank test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The clinical features of the 25 patients are presented in
Table 1. The ratio of men to women was 2.6:1. The median age was 58 years, and approximately 50% of patients
were aged 60 years. Only 1 patient had B symptoms.
Elevated LDH levels were observed in 20% of patients.
Most patients (88%) presented with localized disease.
According to the Ann Arbor staging system, 18 patients
had stage IE disease, 4 patients had stage IIE disease, and
3 patients had stage IIIE or IVE disease. The majority of
patients presented with a good performance status (0-1)
according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) and low-risk IPI scores (0-1).
Four patients with lymph node involvement presented initially with positive cervical lymph nodes. However, involvement of distant lymph nodes or extranodal
sites without cervical lymph node metastasis was observed
in 3 of 7 patients with stage IIE to IVE disease. Two
patients had only mediastinal or para-aortic lymph node
involvement, and the remaining patient with stage IVE

Response to Treatment and Outcome
An overall response to treatment was achieved by 19
patients (76%). The CR rate was 60%, the partial response
rate was 16%, and 24% of patients had progressive disease.
At the time of last follow-up, 11 patients had died (10 died
of lymphoma, and 1 died of comorbid disease).
At a median follow-up of 37 months for surviving
patients, the 3-year OS and PFS rates for all patients were
44% and 52.8%. The median OS was 35 months, and the
median PFS was 52 months (Fig. 1).
Prognostic Factors
Clinical features were evaluated to determine their prognostic significance on OS. Univariate analysis revealed
that performance status and the IPI score were significant
prognostic factors for OS (Table 2). The 3-year OS rate
was 51%, and the median OS was 48 months for patients
who had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 compared with a 3-year OS rate of 20% and a median OS of

Patterns of Failure
Ten patients (40%) had developed progressive disease or a
relapse. The failure patterns were analyzed in 8 of these
patients who had sufficient data available. Extranodal dissemination was the primary pattern of failure; 7 patients
developed extranodal failures, and 3 of these patients also
developed distant lymph node failure. Only 1 patient had
a local relapse, and none of the patients had a lymphatic
recurrence in the head and neck area. The sites of extranodal dissemination observed were the skin (n ¼ 2), testis (n
¼ 2), lung and spleen (n ¼ 1), central nervous system
(CNS) (n ¼ 1), and stomach (n ¼ 1).
Figure 2. Overall survival is illustrated according to the international prognostic index (IPI).

Figure 3. Overall survival is illustrated for patients who
achieved a complete response (CR) and patients who did not
achieve a CR (non-CR).

The prognosis for patients who achieved a CR was
significantly better than that for patients who achieved a
partial response or progressive disease. The 3-year OS rate
and median OS were 67% and 52 months, respectively,
for patients who had a CR compared with 13% and 13
months, respectively, for those who did not achieve a CR
(P ¼ .008) (Fig. 3).
For patients with stage IE and IIE disease, the 3-year
OS rate and median OS were 44% and 36 months,
respectively. Of 3 patients who had stage IIIE and IVE
disease, 2 died of their disease at 11 months and 13
months, and 1 was alive at the last follow-up of 73
months. No significant difference in survival was observed
between chemotherapy with or without rituximab, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone, or
GC B-cell and non-GC B-cell subtype, probably because
of the small number of patients (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Although extranodal, nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma of
the nasal cavity has been recognized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity and has been widely evaluated,15,17,25,30-34 there are scarce data describing the
clinical behavior and treatment outcome of nasal
DLBCL.20,22,23 The current report provides a comprehensive evaluation that focuses exclusively on clinical features and treatment outcomes. Patients who had nasal
DLBCL shared some clinical similarities and had some
disparities with patients who had lymph node DLBCL
and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.3,25,26,35 Most of the
clinical features of primary nasal DLBCL, such as the
male predominance, large proportion of early stage disease, good performance status, low-risk IPI scores, and
frequent extranodal failure, are similar to the features of
nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.25,26,30-34 In addition, nasal
DLBCL and lymph node DLBCL share some similar features, such as older age of presentation, low frequency of
B symptoms, and sensitivity to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy3,9; however, these features are in contrast to those
of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.15,25,32 Another finding
from this study was that patients with nasal DLBCL
appeared to have an unfavorable prognosis.
In this series, nasal DLBCL was observed primarily
in older adults (median age, 58 years) and predominantly
in men. The majority of patients presented with stage IE
or IIE disease, and only 12% of patients had stage IIIE or
IVE disease. This finding differed from that reported in
patients with lymph node DLBCL, in which there was a
slight predominance of early stage disease,3,9 but was similar to the stage distribution reported in other series of
nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma and DLBCL of the Waldeyer
ring, in which early stage disease was more frequent
(>70% of patients).3,6,26,35 Similar to these latter

lymphoma subtypes, the majority of patients with nasal
DLBCL presented with a good performance status and a
low IPI score. In contrast, patients with lymph node
DLBCL tended to have intermediate-risk or high-risk IPI
scores.3,9
The primary pattern of failure for patients with
nasal DLBCL was extranodal dissemination. The skipping lymph node spread to areas outside the head and
neck observed at presentation and the propensity for
extranodal failure post-treatment were indicative of
noncontiguous spread by nasal DLBCL, a pattern reminiscent of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.25,26 We
observed a low frequency of CNS relapse (4%) in
patients with nasal DLBCL; thus, and the use of CNS
chemoprophylaxis was not justified.
Although patients with nasal DLBCL tended to
have a low tumor burden, as indicated by the large proportion of early stage disease and the low frequency of
elevated LDH and B symptoms, they had an unfavorable
prognosis, and <50% of patients were alive at 3 years
(median OS, 35 months). After they received standard
treatment with CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy
with or without rituximab, patients with nasal DLBCL
seemed to suffer an aggressive clinical course. The survival in this series of patients with nasal DLBCL was inferior to that of most series of patients with lymph node
or Waldeyer ring DLBCL and was even inferior to the
survival of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.3,6,17,25,35 The 5-year OS rate for patients with
DLBCL is approximately 80% for those with localized
disease and at least 50% for those with advanced disease.36-40 Because of their differing chemosensitivities,
the treatment options for patients DLBCL differ from
those for patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.15,25,36-40 In our previous studies, we reported a
5-year OS rate of 71% to 77% for patients with early
stage nasal or Waldeyer ring NK/T-cell lymphoma who
received primary radiotherapy.25,26,33,41-43 However,
other studies have demonstrated that patients with B-cell
or T-cell lymphomas of the sinonasal tract or nose and
nasopharynx had a higher survival rate than those with
NK/T-cell lymphoma.12,20 It should be noted that the
prognosis for patients with DLBCL varies according to
the primary disease site.2-9 Several studies have demonstrated that patients with DLBCL of the Waldeyer ring
or gastrointestinal tract had better survival than those
with lymph node DLBCL or DLBCL of the CNS.2,3,6,9
Because of the rarity of the disease, the prognostic
factors in nasal DLBCL have not been previously

Cancer

addressed. The current series demonstrates that performance status and IPI score are important prognostic factors.
Patients with good performance status and low-risk IPI
had a favorable survival rate, whereas those with poor performance status and intermediate-risk IPI scores had a
very poor prognosis. Similarly, previous studies have indicated that the IPI score is an effective predictor of treatment outcome in patients with DLBCL and nasal NK/Tcell lymphoma.14,25,28,44
Data from this study have demonstrated that primary nasal DLBCL appears to have clinical behavior and
features that are distinct from those of lymph node
DLBCL or nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The poor prognosis and propensity for extranodal failure observed in
these patients illustrates the need for more effective or experimental therapies. Future work should be directed at
exploration of the genome and gene expression profiling
to achieve a better understanding of the biologic and clinical features of primary nasal DLBCL.
