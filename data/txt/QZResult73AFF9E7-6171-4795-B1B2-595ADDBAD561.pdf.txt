Abstract

Author Manuscript

Hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that display key residues of the p53 transactivation domain have
emerged as bona fide clinical candidates for reactivating the tumor suppression function of p53 in
cancer by dual targeting of the negative regulators HDM2 and HDMX. A recent study questioned
the mechanistic specificity of such stapled peptides based on interrogating their capacity to disrupt
p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes in living cells using a new recombinase enhanced
bimolecular luciferase complementation platform (ReBiL). Here, we directly evaluate the cellular
uptake, intracellular targeting selectivity, and p53-dependent cytotoxicity of the clinical prototype
ATSP-7041. We find that under standard serum-containing tissue culture conditions, ATSP-7041
achieves intracellular access without membrane disruption, dose-dependently dissociates both p53/
HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes but not an unrelated protein complex in long-term ReBiL
experiments, and is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells bearing wild-type p53 by inducing a surge
in p53 protein level. These studies underscore the importance of a thorough step-wise approach,
including consideration of the time-dependence of cellular uptake and intracellular distribution, in
evaluating and advancing stapled peptides for clinical translation.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Helix-in-groove protein interactions represent the structural basis for a host of signaling
mechanisms implicated in human disease1, 2. Among the most established and clinicallyrelevant interactions are the complexes between the alpha-helical transactivation domain of
p53 and its negative regulators HDM2 and HDMX3. p53 is an essential tumor suppressor
that is frequently mutated in human cancer to avoid cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response
to DNA damage4. Alternative oncogenic mechanisms for p53 suppression in cancer involve
the overexpression of HDM2, an E3 ligase that binds, inhibits, and destroys p535, and
HDMX, which lacks E3 ligase activity and instead binds and sequesters p53, and may

enhance HDM2 function through heterodimeric interaction6. When HDM2 and HDMX are
overproduced, cancer cells are under less genetic pressure to mutate p53, since the tumor
suppressor protein is otherwise neutralized. Thus, in the context of cancers bearing wild-type
p53, inhibitors of HDM2 and HDMX have the potential to restore p53 activity, prompting
vigorous efforts to translate such strategies to the clinic.

Author Manuscript

The small molecule Nutlin-3a selectively blocks HDM2 and thereby produces a dramatic
increase in cellular p53 protein7. In the absence of HDMX, such inhibitors restore p53mediated apoptosis, justifying the advancement of next-generation analogs such as
RO5045337 to clinical testing. However, in the presence of HDMX, the drug-induced surge
in p53 can be ineffectual due to the rapid formation of inhibitory p53-HDMX complexes8.
We previously developed a series of stapled peptides modeled after the α-helical p53
transactivation domain, which naturally engages both HDM2 and HDMX, and identified a
lead (i, i+7) stapled construct with nanomolar binding affinity to both targets and the
capacity to restore p53-dependent cell death in vitro and in vivo8, 9. Like many small
molecule leads, a shortcoming of our prototype construct, SAH-p53-8, was its avid serumbinding activity, which limited its cellular potency and clinical advancement, prompting
sequence-based optimization10. By retaining our original (i, i+7) staple position and the
essential residues for HDM2/HDMX interaction (e.g. F19, W23), but sampling alternative
residues based on phage display results, next-generation stapled p53 peptides with drug-like
properties were developed10, one of which is currently being tested in clinical trials
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02264613). Similar design variations on this theme have
led other investigators to generate additional series of stapled p53 peptides that display
varying degrees of biological activity, but none have advanced to clinical testing thus
far11, 12.

An obvious requirement for on-mechanism biological function of stapled peptides is
intracellular access for target engagement. The recent development of ReBiL, a splitluciferase system for probing intracellular protein targeting by small molecule and peptide
ligands, provided a new opportunity to evaluate compounds reported to modulate the p53
pathway13. Several key conclusions of the study were that stapled peptides may not disrupt
p53/HDM2 or p53/HDMX interactions efficiently in living cells and that cytotoxicity can be
p53-independent if non-specific membrane disruption ensues. Given the conflicting
interpretations of data regarding the biological activity and mechanism of action of stapled
p53 peptides8, 10, 12, 13, coupled with the potentially confounding factors of having
conducted ReBiL assays over short time courses and without direct measurement of cellular
uptake, we undertook a step-wise approach to evaluating the mechanism of action of stapled
p53 peptides in cellular systems.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
One of the challenges in cross-comparing the biochemical and biological activities of stapled
p53 peptides generated by different laboratories is ensuring that all constructs are
synthesized, purified, and quantitated in a uniform manner. Thus, we initiated our study by
re-synthesizing an exemplary panel of stapled p53 peptides reported by distinct research
groups, namely ATSP-704110, SAH-p53-88, and Staplin11 (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure

1). We generated the compounds according to our established methods14, 15, using LC/MSbased purification and amino acid analysis for rigorous quantitation. To avoid any
potentially confounding effects of exposing cells to serum-free treatments and to better
simulate physiologic conditions required for clinical translation, all studies were performed
with 10% serum. First, we conducted a cellular uptake assessment by exposing SAOS-2
parental cells (used to construct the ReBiL cell lines) to fluorescently-labeled stapled p53
peptides at a dose of 5 μM for 4 hours in standard serum-containing media, followed by
washing, trypsinization to remove any protein surface-bound peptide, repeat washing,
cellular lysis, and FITC scan of electrophoresed lysates. We observed fluorescent signal in
the lysates of cells treated with ATSP-7041 and its F19A mutant control, with FITC-Staplin
peptide also detected, although at lower levels (Figure 1b). Consistent with our prior
studies8, 9, there is little to no FITC-SAH-p53-8 signal after cellular treatment for 4 hours in
the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Next, we investigated whether the observed
FITC signal in cellular lysates could have achieved intracellular access by direct membrane
disruption. We performed LDH release assays on SAOS-2 cells 30 minutes after treating
cells in standard serum-containing media with a serial dilution of peptides starting from 30
μM, well above the 5 μM dose used to assess cellular uptake. Importantly, no membrane
disruption was observed for any of the stapled p53 peptides (Figure 1c). As another measure
to rule-out non-specific activity, we tested the effect of stapled peptide treatments on the
viability of p53-null SAOS-2 cells, which should exhibit no mechanism-based response to
the compounds due to the absence of wild-type p53. Using a serial dilution starting at the
same high micromolar dose of peptide applied in the LDH release assays, we found no
evidence of non-specific cytotoxicity, as measured by viability assay at 72 hours (Figure 1d).
By applying this sequence of screening assays, which in our view should be a prerequisite
for cellular testing of stapled peptides in general16, we document effective cellular uptake of
a subset of stapled p53 peptides under standard 10% serum conditions, and no evidence of
membrane disruption or p53-independent toxicity for any of the compounds.

The ReBiL protein interaction assay system is ideally suited to measure the disruptive effect
of small molecules and peptides on intracellular protein interactions13. In the context of
evaluating p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes, the selected cell line of choice was
SAOS-2, an osteosarcoma cell line that is itself p53-null to avoid any potentially
confounding effects of p53-mediated cytotoxicity on the ReBiL signal8. For the same
reason, a mutant p53 isoform (aa 2–312 truncate; R273H) was chosen for doxycyclineinduced expression in the ReBiL system. In a previously reported study13, doxycycline
induction of the protein complexes was performed first, followed by doxycycline withdrawal
upon treating the cells with small molecules or stapled p53 peptides. Because the ReBiL
signal declines on its own during the subsequent 6 hour assay period, so does the window for
detecting specific compound activity. What’s more, the mechanisms for cellular uptake of
small molecules and stapled peptides are different, with the former being rapid diffusion and
the latter time-dependent, fluid-phase macropinocytosis17, 18. Thus, short-term ReBiL assays
may not provide sufficient time for stapled peptides to emerge from pinosomes, transit to the
cytoplasm and nucleus, and achieve appreciable extra-vesicular concentrations to exert
biochemical activity. Despite this experimental design constraint, ATSP-7041 dose-

responsively disrupted pre-formed p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes in the prior study,
but compound performance was deemed slow for HDM2 and marginal for HDMX13.

To eliminate the potentially confounding variables of a progressively fading ReBiL signal
and time courses of limited duration, here we performed the ReBiL analyses upon cotreating with doxycycline and stapled peptides for 10 hour time periods. In addition, we used
the unrelated protein interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1 as a negative control for
ReBiL testing. For Nutlin-3a, the small molecule positive control for selective HDM2
inhibition, we observed effective blockade of the p53-HDM2 interaction, but no activity
against p53/HDMX or BRCA1/BARD1 (Figure 2a–c). In contrast, ATSP-7041 exhibited
dose-responsive disruption of both the p53-HDM2 and p53-HDMX interactions, with no
disruptive effect on BRCA1/BARD1 complex formation (Figure 2d–f). ATSP-7342, the
F19A point mutant of ATSP-7041, had no effect on any of the ReBiL cell lines (Figure 2g–
i). SAH-p53-8, whose uptake is impeded by 10% serum conditions, showed modest activity
against the p53-HDM2 and p53-HDMX interactions at the higher 20 μM dose level with no
effect on BRCA1/BARD1 (Figure 2j–l), whereas Staplin disrupted only the p53/HDM2
interaction (in non-dose-responsive fashion), with no effect on p53/HDMX or BRCA1/
BARD1 (Figure 2m–o). Based on these data, ATSP-7041 indeed represents an optimized
version of SAH-p53-8, and effectively disrupts intracellular p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX
complexes in a dose-responsive and sequence-dependent manner over time.

To link the demonstrated on-mechanism biochemical activity of ATSP-7041 in ReBiL cells
to p53-mediated killing of cancer cells, we performed viability testing and correlative p53
western blotting of SJSA-1 (HDM2-dependent) and SJSA-X (HDM2- and HDMXdependent) osteosarcoma cells bearing wild-type p53. Whereas Nutlin-3a selectively
impaired the viability of SJSA-1 cell lines, ATSP-7041, but not its F19A point mutant, killed
both SJSA-1 and SJSA-X lines in the presence of 10% serum (Figure 3a–b). Under these
same conditions, SAH-p53-8 had little (SJSA-1) to no (SJSA-X) effect, whereas Staplin was
inactive in both cell lines except for precipitous toxicity at the highest dose level (30 μM) in
SJSA-1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2a–b). Importantly, we found that treatment of SJSA-1
and SJSA-X cells with ATSP-7041 produced an increase in p53 protein levels, which was
not observed upon treatment with ATSP-7342 (Figure 3c). These viability and p53 western
data are consistent with the previously reported effects of ATSP-7041 on SJSA-1 cells,
including (1) upregulation of p53 protein and the resultant increased expression of p21, as
assessed at the RNA and protein levels; (2) cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and
reduced cell viability, as assessed by BrdU, annexin V binding, and MTT assays,
respectively; and (3) tumor suppression in an in vivo xenograft model of SJSA-1
osteosarcoma10.

Confocal microscopy confirmed that FITC-ATSP peptides were initially localized to
intracellular vesicles (Figures 3d and e). Over the 4 hour time course, the cytosolic and
especially nuclear accumulation of ATSP-7041 became progressively evident, whereas
ATSP-7342, which does not target HDM2 or HDMX, showed no nuclear accumulation
(Figure 3d–e and Supplementary Figure 3). These data reinforce the importance of
establishing the cellular uptake kinetics and cellular distribution of stapled peptides in
advance of designing experiments to test phenotypic endpoints, as highlighted by the time

p53 is a “clear and present danger” to the development, maintenance, and chemoresistance
of human cancer. As such, the majority of cancer cells disarm p53 by deletion, mutation,
degradation, and/or sequestration5, 19–21. When the risk of wild-type p53 is mitigated in
cancer cells by HDM2 and/or HDMX overexpression, targeted inhibition of these negative
regulators holds promise to restore p53-mediated cell death. To date, the two drug modalities
that have advanced to clinical testing are selective small molecule HDM2 inhibitors
(RO5045337, Roche and AMG233, Amgen) and dual HDM2/HDMX targeting stapled p53
peptides (ALRN-6924, Aileron Therapeutics). The latter approach has the added benefit of
overcoming HDMX-mediated resistance to small molecule HDM2 inhibitors in the context
of HDMX overexpression8, 10, as demonstrated here by the differential effects of Nutlin-3a
and ATSP-7041 in SJSA-1 vs. SJSA-X cell lines. Because stapled peptides represent a new
drug modality with potential broad application to targeting pathologic helix-in-groove
interactions16, intensive efforts have been underway to more fully understand their
biophysical, biological, and pharmacokinetic properties.

In this context, one report claimed that a stapled peptide modeled after the pro-apoptotic
BIM protein22, 23 exhibited no biological activity due to lack of cell penetrance24, and
another suggested that stapled peptides modeled after the p53 transactivation domain8, 9
were either nonspecific (although the data actually showed inactivity due to added serum)12
or achieved cytotoxicity, at least in part, as a result of nonspecific membrane disruption13. In
each of these cases, no direct measures of cellular uptake were performed and thus
interpretations about stapled peptide performance were inferred rather than fully examined,
leading to questionable conclusions and residual ambiguity. Given the importance of
clarifying the intracellular mechanism of action that formed the basis for the first clinical
trial of a stapled peptide in human cancer, we established a step-wise vetting workflow for
ATSP-7041. Head-to-head comparison of uniformly synthesized and quantitated constructs
across LDH release, cellular uptake, and non-specific cytotoxicity assay screening under
standard serum-containing conditions demonstrated that stapled p53 peptides can
unequivocally gain intracellular access without membrane disruption and without triggering
non-specific cytotoxicity in the presence of standard 10% serum. The use of ReBiL, a highly
sensitive and specific protein interaction cell assay system13, further confirmed the unique
capacity of ATSP-7041 to disrupt both p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes in a doseresponsive, sequence-dependent, and protein interaction-specific fashion. Based on this
rigorous mechanistic validation, ATSP-7041 was then tested in isogenic cell lines driven by
HDM2 or HDM2/HDMX and was, again, the only construct to impair cellular viability in
both contexts and in the presence of 10% serum. Importantly, ATSP-7041 killing coincided
with upregulation of p53 and had no effect on p53-null cells. Thus, these data highlight the
capacity to generate, validate, and clinically translate stapled peptides for intracellular
targeting of pathologic protein interactions by applying a comprehensive step-wise workflow
that spans structure-based design, chemical synthesis, biochemical testing, cellular uptake
analysis, and validation of intracellular mechanism of action.

using the MycoAlert™ mycoplasma detection kit [Lonza Biologics, Inc.]) were seeded in 6well plates (2.5×105 cells/well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS and, after overnight

platform. Effect of Nutlin-3a (a–c), ATSP-7041 (d–f), ATSP-7342 (g–i), SAH-p53-8 (j–l),
and Staplin (m–o) on the ReBiL luminescence signal generated by SAOS-2 cells coexpressing p53/HDM2 (left), p53/HDMX (middle) or BRCA1/BARD1 (right) in the
presence of doxycycline and 10% serum. SAOS-2 ReBiL cells (Wahl laboratory, verified
mycoplasma-free using the MycoAlert™ mycoplasma detection kit [Lonza Biologics, Inc.]),
were plated in 96-well opaque plates (2×104 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37°C in
DMEM/F12 media (50:50) containing FBS (10%), G418 (400 μg/mL), and ciprofloxacin

(10 μg/ml). The following day, doxycycline (500 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), D-luciferin
potassium salt (100 μM; L-8220, Biosynth), and the indicated concentration of small
molecule or peptide were added. Of note, Nutlin-3a dosing was not escalated above 10 μM
due to the emergence of nonspecific activity, as reflected by a similar level of signal
suppression in both the p53/HDMX and BRCA1/BARD1 cell lines where no mechanistic
effect is expected. Luminescence was recorded every 2 hours on a BMG LABTECH
CLARIOstar plate reader (integration time 0.8 s), with culture plates maintained in an
incubator between measurements. Error bars are mean ± s.d. for experiments performed in
technical triplicate for p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX ReBiL, and technical duplicate for the
negative control BRCA1/BARD1. The experiments were performed in biological triplicate,
each with independent ReBiL cell platings and treatments.

Differential effects of Nutlin-3a and ATSP-7041 on isogenic SJSA cell lines dependent on
either HDM2 or HDM2/HDMX. (a–b) Cell viability responses of SJSA-1 (a) and SJSA-X
(b) cells to treatment with Nutlin-3a, ATSP-7041, or ATSP-7342 in the presence of 10%
serum, as evaluated by CellTiter-Glo assay. SJSA-1 and SJSA-X cells (Wahl laboratory,
verified mycoplasma-free using the MycoAlert™ mycoplasma detection kit [Lonza
Biologics, Inc.]) were plated in 96-well opaque plates (7.5×103/well) in DMEM containing
10% FBS and, the following day, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of
peptide or vehicle control (0.3% DMSO). Peptide stocks (10, 3.3, 1.1, 0.33, 0.11, 0.03, 0.01

mM in 100% DMSO) were diluted into ddH2O to achieve 10X working stocks of 300, 100,
30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3 and 0.1 μM, which were then diluted 10-fold into the treatment wells. Cell
viability was measured after 72 hours by CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega), performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions, and percent viability calculated based on the
untreated controls. Error bars are mean ± s.e.m. for experiments performed in technical
duplicate and repeated three times with independent cell plating and treatments. (c) p53
western blot analysis of electrophoresed lysates from SJSA-1 and SJSA-X cells treated for 8
hours with Nutlin-3a, ATSP-7041, or ATSP-7342 in the presence of 10% serum. The series
of p53-immunoreactive bands that run above p53, and most evident in the Nutlin-3a lanes,
are consistent with HDM2-ubiquitylated species, as reported25. SJSA-1 and SJSA-X cells
were plated in 6-well plates (2×105/well) overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS and, the
following day, the cells were treated with 10 μM peptide or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) in
10% FBS-containing media for 8 hours. The cells were then collected, washed, lysed (1%
CHAPs, 150 mM NaCl, 20mM TRIS, pH 7.2) and the crude lysates cleared by
centrifugation. The concentration of protein in the supernatant was determined using the
Pierce BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). A 10 μg aliquot of protein from each condition was
electrophoresed on a 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and western blotting
performed with p53 (DO-1: sc-126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-actin (clone AC-15,
Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies using Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent
and an Amersham Imager 600. (d–e) Confocal microscopy images of SJSA-1 (d) and SJSAX (e) cells treated with FITC-ATSP-7041 or FITC-ATSP-7342 in the presence of 10%
serum. Cells were plated in 8-well glass chambers (2.5×104 cells/well) in DMEM containing
10% FBS. After 48 hours, the media was replaced with OptiMEM containing 10% FBS and
treated with 5 μM peptide. Confocal images were acquired at the indicated time points using
a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal (Andor Technology) mounted on a Nikon Ti-E
inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments), equipped with a 100x 1.4 NA Plan Apo objective
lens, Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), and 488 nm laser. Acquisition
parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus were controlled by Andor iQ software (Andor
Technology).
