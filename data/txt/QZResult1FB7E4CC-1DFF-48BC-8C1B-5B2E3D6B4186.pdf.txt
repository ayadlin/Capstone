BACKGROUND: b-emitting bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have historically been administered for pain palliation whereas docetaxel prolongs life in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In combination, these agents simultaneously target the bone stroma and cancer cell to optimize antitumor effects. The toxicity and efficacy when each agent is combined at
full, recommended doses, in a repetitive fashion is not well established. METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRPC and 3 bone
lesions received 153Sm-EDTMP (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate) at a dose of 1.0 mCi/kg every 9 weeks
and docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients were allowed to continue additional cycles, defined by 9 weeks of treatment, until intolerance or biochemical/radiographic disease progression. RESULTS: Of the
30 patients treated, approximately 50% were considered to be taxane-naive, 36.7% were taxane-refractory, and 13.3% had previously
been exposed to taxanes but were not considered refractory. Patients received on average 2.5 cycles of treatment (6.5 doses of
docetaxel and 2.5 doses of 153Sm-EDTMP). Twelve patients (40%) demonstrated a decline in their prostate-specific antigen level of
50%. The median progression-free survival (biochemical or radiographic) was 7.0 months and the overall survival was 14.3 months.
Nine patients (30%) did not recover platelet counts >100 K/mm3 after a median of 3 cycles to allow for additional treatment, with 4
patients experiencing prolonged thrombocytopenia. The most common reasons for trial discontinuation were progressive disease and
hematologic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that 153Sm-EDTMP can be safely combined with docetaxel at full doses on an ongoing basis in patients with mCRPC. Although thrombocytopenia limited therapy for some patients, preliminary efficacy supports the strategy of combining a radiopharmaceutical with chemotherapy, which is an appealing strategy given

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has a strong predilection for bone, and therefore strategies using
bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals that target the bone microenvironment are scientifically relevant. However, these
agents are likely clinically underutilized. Concerns for myelosuppression, lack of a demonstrated survival benefit of bemitters, and the need for collaboration with nuclear medicine have all contributed to their limited use. Furthermore,
although b-emitting radiopharmaceuticals have long been approved for the treatment of bone pain, they have not been
extensively investigated as antitumor agents either alone or in combination with other agents.
Combining a radiopharmaceutical such as 153Sm-EDTMP (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate), which is known to palliate bone pain, with docetaxel, an agent known to prolong survival in patients with bone
and soft tissue/visceral mCRPC, may enhance chemotherapeutic response and improve clinical outcomes. Each agent
may offer independent effects that in combination provide additive benefit to the patient.

Repetitive Docetaxel and

Previous trials have systematically combined these
agents, but typically have limited either the dose or number
of cycles of the b radiopharmaceutical. For such reasons, we
previously conducted a dose escalation trial exploring a repetitively dosed regimen of 153Sm-EDTMP and docetaxel.1
153
Sm-EDTMP was given every 6 to 9 weeks and docetaxel
was given every 3 weeks in 28 patients with mCRPC. The
maximum tolerated dose, based on cycle 1 toxicity, was not
reached in this study, thereby providing the rationale for
using the full US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved doses of each agent (1 millicurie [mCi]/kg of
153
Sm-EDTMP and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel) as ongoing
therapy. To facilitate our understanding of the toxicity profile, explore preliminary efficacy and duration of effect, and
create a reference database by which combinations of a-emitting radiopharmaceuticals and docetaxel could be compared,
herein we present data regarding the 30 patients treated at full
doses of docetaxel and 153Sm-EDTMP. These patients were
treated repetitively until they experienced toxicity or disease
progression, through a preplanned expansion cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Patients were treated at full FDA-approved doses of docetaxel
(75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) and 153Sm-EDTMP (1.0 mCi/kg
every 9 weeks). The protocol was approved by the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board
and all patients provided written informed consent.
Patients

Eligible patients had histologic evidence of prostate adenocarcinoma, castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL),
and biochemical or radiographic disease progression as
previously described.1 All patients had to have at least 3
bone metastases noted on bone scintigraphy. Visceral metastases or symptomatic lymphadenopathy were allowed
provided there was also bone disease.
Adequate hematologic function was defined as a white
blood cell count 3.0 K/mm3, an absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) 1.5 K/mm3, a platelet count 100 K/mm3,
and hemoglobin 10 mg/dL. Adequate hepatic function
required bilirubin levels of less than the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Adequate
renal function was defined as serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL.
A Karnofsky performance status 60 was required.
Patients who received >1 course of external beam
radiation targeted to bone, had circumferential or
transcortical pathologic long bone fractures, or had spinal
cord compression were excluded.

Sm-EDTMP/Autio et al

Figure 1. The treatment schedule for the expansion cohort is
shown. 153Sm-EDTMP (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate) was administered at a dose of 1 mCi/
kg and docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2.

Treatment

Cycles consisted of 153Sm-EDTMP administered on day 1
of each cycle, with docetaxel administered on days 1, 22,
and 43, as seen in Figure 1. All patients received prednisone
at a dose of 5 mg twice daily throughout the cycle, and
dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg twice daily on the day
before, day of, and day after docetaxel treatment. On day 1,
patients were treated with 1.0 mCi/kg of 153Sm-EDTMP
followed by 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel between 6 and 30 hours
later. Docetaxel was administered again on days 22 and 43
in the absence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Treatment was permitted to be held for 1 week for toxicity recovery, with
retreatment permitted in the absence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Patients were eligible to receive additional cycles in the
presence of grade 0 to 1 neutropenia, a platelet count
100 K/mm3, or grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity.
Recycling was allowed to be held for up to 2 weeks to allow
for recovery of toxicity to permitted levels.
Patients were tested for hematologic parameters on
day 1 and every 7 days thereafter. Prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) was added after
each docetaxel treatment for persistent grade 4 neutropenia lasting 1 week, or in the event of neutropenic fever.
A dose reduction to 60 mg/m2 of docetaxel and 0.5 mCi/
kg2 of 153Sm-EDTMP was allowed for grade 4 thrombocytopenia. For other serious nonhematologic toxicity,
dose reductions of both drugs by 25% for a grade 2 toxicity and 50% for a grade 3 toxicity were allowed.
Study Endpoints
Safety

The primary endpoint was safety with chronic dosing.
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for the first 6 patients, as
prespecified by the protocol, was defined as any neutropenic fever, grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, grade 3
neutropenia that lasted for 7 days despite growth factor
support, grade 3 anemia or thrombocytopenia that
lasted for 5 days, or failure of count recovery to allow

for therapy in cycle 1. Any DLT occurring in the first 6
patients was considered grounds for discontinuation. For
the subsequent 24 patients, the definition of a DLT was
specifically liberalized to test the tolerance of the regimen
when administered repetitively. Therefore, DLT was not
defined by cycle 1 toxicity but by failure to meet criteria
to allow for recycling as described above in the treatment
section. Details of toxicities and adverse events were
assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all patients at all
cycles.2 Complete blood counts were performed weekly,
and physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry,
and adverse event inquiries were performed once every 3
weeks. All patients who received at least 1 dose of study
drug were included in the analysis.
Antitumor effects

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time
between the start of treatment and the first documented
disease progression or death. Disease progression was
indicated by meeting at least 1 of 3 criteria: biochemical
disease progression, soft-tissue progression, or a combina3188

tion of a new bone lesion(s) with a rising prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) or worsening bone pain. PSA was drawn at
baseline and every 3 weeks. Biochemical disease progression was defined as a 50% increase in PSA over nadir in
patients who had experienced a 50% decline in PSA on
study. In patients with a <50% decline in PSA, disease
progression was defined as a 25% increase over nadir or
baseline, whichever was lower.
Radiographic assessments were performed at baseline and every 12 weeks. Soft-tissue response was assessed
by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) (version 1.0).3 The appearance of 1 new
bone lesions in the setting of a rising PSA or worsening
bone pain (based on clinical judgment) was also considered disease progression.

Adverse events were graded according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Events  grade 2
were reported if they occurred in  25% of patients, unless a grade 3 or 4 toxicity was noted. All grade 3 or 4 events were included.

Bone marker analyses

Indices of bone deposition (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and bone resorption (serum and
urine N-telopeptide) were assessed every 3 weeks.
Statistical Analysis

The dose escalations in this trial were conducted based on
the probabilistic calculation that if the true risk of toxicity
was 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, and 0.60 the probability of
escalation was therefore 0.91, 0.71, 0.49, 0.31, 0.17, and
0.08, respectively. It was on this basis that doses were escalated to the full FDA-approved doses of each drug, as no
maximum tolerated dose was reached on the basis of cycle 1
toxicity as previously reported.1 The last 6 patients of the
dose escalation cohort were included in the expansion cohort
analyses, in which 24 additional patients were treated. All 30
patients were treated until disease progression or toxicity, to
confirm that the dose selected based on the above probabilities was in fact clinically safe. PFS and overall survival (OS)
were computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

of this trial, and were included in the current study
because they received the same dose/schedule as the
remaining patients reported herein (part of the expansion
cohort of this same trial). Table 1 provides baseline
patient characteristics. Fifteen patients (50%) were taxane-naive, 11 patients (36.7%) were taxane-refractory,
and 4 patients (13.3%) had previous exposure to taxanes
but were not considered refractory at the time of discontinuation of docetaxel because they were responding to
treatment. For the purposes of the current study, taxane
refractoriness was defined as definitive biochemical and/
or radiographic disease progression while receiving taxane
therapy. No patient received <3 cycles of docetaxel (225
mg/m2) who met the study definition of being taxane-refractory. Cabazitaxel was not approved at the time the current study was conducted and therefore a more
contemporary definition of taxane refractoriness (ie,
refractoriness in both the first-line and second-line setting) was not implemented.

of 2.0 mCi/kg of 153Sm-EDTMP over 2 doses (range, 1
dose-4 doses), and 375 mg/m2 of docetaxel over 5 doses
(range, 1 dose-12 doses). One patient in the taxaneexposed group had the dose of both drugs reduced by
25% mid-cycle because of grade 2 fatigue. No other dose
reductions occurred.

Ten patients failed to recycle on the basis of hematologic toxicity (DLT). Thrombocytopenia was the most
common hematologic reason (9 patients) and 1 patient
experienced neutropenic fever during the first cycle. Disease progression accounted for discontinuation of treatment in 10 patients. The remainder of the patients came
off the study for comorbid conditions, patient request for
a treatment break, or closure of the trial.

stay on the study as per protocol. A total of 18 patients
received GCSF prophylaxis.
Thrombocytopenia

Eight patients (27%) experienced grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia. Five were taxane-naive, 1 was previously
exposed to taxanes, and 2 patients were taxane-refractory.

prolonged thrombocytopenia (87 days-177 days) that
failed to recover to 100 K/mm3 after 1 or 2 cycles. One of
these patients was taxane-naive, 1 had received prior taxane exposure, and 2 were taxane-refractory. Three of these
4 patients were found to have new lesions on bone scintigraphy with the onset of thrombocytopenia and went on
to receive external beam radiation to bone. The fourth
patient did not have a bone scan performed; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stable disease, but the
patient’s pain increased.
Antitumor Effects

Best-response PSA waterfall plots are presented in
Figure 3. Overall, 24 patients (80%) had a decline in PSA,
12 of whom (40%) had a decline of at least 50%. Of the
10 patients with measurable soft-tissue disease, 2 (20%)
achieved a partial response and 4 (40%) had stable
disease.
The median PFS was 7.0 months (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 3.7 months-8.8 months) and the overall survival was 14.3 months (95% CI, 10.3 months-24.0
months) (Fig. 4). The longest PFS and OS was seen in the
taxane-naive group, with a median PFS of 8.2 months
(95% CI, 5.7 months-13.7 months) and a median OS of
23.4 months (95% CI, 13.8 months-42.7 months). Taxane-exposed patients had a median PFS of 7.0 months
(95% CI, 3.2 months-11.5 months) and median OS of
19.4 months (95% CI, 5.6 months-30.3 months). The
taxane-refractory group had a median PFS of 3.5 months
(95% CI, 0.7 months-8.0 months) and a median OS of
9.6 months (95% CI, 4.8 months-13.5 months).
Bone Markers

Figure 4. Overall survival and progression-free survival are
shown, defined by prostate-specific antigen, imaging, or
death. The median overall progression-free survival was 7.0
months and the overall survival was 14.3 months.

The median platelet nadir in cycle 1 was 97 K/mm3
(range, 39 K/mm32172 K/mm3) and the all-cycle median nadir was 64 K/mm3 (range, 19 K/mm32172 K/
mm3). Nine patients (30%) did not recover platelet
counts that were sufficient to allow for recycling: 2
occurred in cycle 1, 2 occurred in cycle 2, 3 occurred in
cycle 3, 1 occurred in cycle 5, and 1 occurred in cycle 6.
Four of the 9 patients who did not recover their platelet
count to allow for recycling (13% of the total) experienced

Eighteen patients (60%) received zoledronic acid during
the trial and 1 patient (3%) received alendronate. The median percentage change from baseline to week 3 was
214.1% for urinary N-telopeptide, 217.6% for serum
N-telopeptide, 282.1% for osteocalcin, and 26.25% for
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
b-emitting radiopharmaceuticals have long been a part of
the armamentarium for treating bone pain in patients with
mCRPC. However, there is growing evidence to support
the development of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals as
antitumor agents to confer benefit beyond palliation. The
most definitive evidence has arisen from the large, randomized phase 3 study of the a-emitter radium-223, which
demonstrated a 2.8-month prolongation in survival compared with placebo.4 Other strategies aimed at developing

Sm-EDTMP/Autio et al

Figure 5. Waterfall plots of bone markers at week 3 after the first dose of 153Sm-EDTMP (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate) at a dose of 1.0 mCi/kg and docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 are shown. The median value is labeled in
green. Serum and urine N-telopeptide (NTx) declined in the majority of patients. The largest declines were observed with osteocalcin; there was a variable effect on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP).

radiopharmaceuticals as antitumor agents have used a combination of b-emitting radiopharmaceuticals with chemotherapy known to prolong survival. However, these earlier
phase studies have typically limited the dose and number of
cycles of the b-emitting radiopharmaceutical used, primarily out of concern for hematologic toxicity.5-8
The current study defines the hematologic toxicity
profile in what to our knowledge is the largest published
cohort to date using repetitive, full dosing of each agent
and in combination. Neutropenia rarely limited therapy
and returned to acceptable levels at a median of 7 days
from nadir, although 60% of patients received GCSF.
Neutropenic fever was noted in 23% of patients and did
not recur after GCSF prophylaxis; all patients recovered
ANC in time for recycling.
Thrombocytopenia was a more significant limitation because recycling was precluded in 9 patients (30%)
after a median of 3 cycles. Four patients did not recover
their platelet count to >100 K/mm3 after a median of 1.5
cycles. These findings are consistent with those of Tu
et al, in which 28% of patients experienced grade
3 hematologic toxicity after 2 cycles of combination

therapy.6 In the current study, 3 of the 4 patients who
never recovered a platelet count >100 K/mm3 had signs
of bone-based radiographic disease progression, suggesting disease status as a possible contributor. In another
study, bone marrow failure occurred in 9 of 43 responders
to induction with weekly docetaxel at a dose of 20 mg/m2
and estramustine who then underwent consolidation with
single-dose 153Sm-EDTMP and continued weekly docetaxel therapy.5 Involvement of prostate cancer in the bone
marrow was the most common finding in these patients.
Bone marrow involvement is common in patients with
terminal stages of CRPC, making the distinction between
drug effect and progressive disease challenging when considering a heavily pretreated population.
The use of 153Sm-EDTMP did not appear to limit
the dose of docetaxel administered in this trial when compared with reference chemotherapy trials in patients with
mCRPC.9,10 Chemotherapy-naive patients received the
same number of cycles of chemotherapy with both drugs
as patients receiving docetaxel alone in previous trials. Even
patients who were previously treated with docetaxel (but
were not refractory) received only 1 fewer cycle of docetaxel

as chemotherapy-naive patients. Therefore, the addition of
153
Sm-EDTMP did not limit the duration of treatment or
total chemotherapy exposure of docetaxel, and perhaps
allowed for additional treatment by enhancing response in
chemotherapy-exposed or chemotherapy-resistant patients.
Preliminary efficacy was demonstrated in this trial in
both chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients.
Overall, 40% of patients experienced a PSA decline
50%. It appears that the use of a radiopharmaceutical in
the current study was able to resensitize previously refractory patients to the effects of docetaxel.
The future use of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals will likely emphasize a-emitting rather than
b-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. a-Emitting radiopharmaceuticals such as radium-223 deliver energy with less tissue
penetration than b-emitters, and subsequently have less hematologic toxicity. Radium-223 was developed as an antitumor agent, and has demonstrated a survival advantage.4
Therefore, we will not pursue 153Sm-EDTMP and docetaxel
in efficacy-based studies, despite the tolerability and preliminary promising efficacy data noted in the current study.
Rather, the design, safety, and efficacy data from the current
study of 153Sm-EDTMP and docetaxel has resulted in a currently ongoing multicenter study combining radium-223
and docetaxel (NCT01106352).11 The rationale underlying
that trial is that the combination involves 2 known life-prolonging therapies, each with a favorable toxicity profile when
given as monotherapy that can target both tumor and bone.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is among
the largest safety and efficacy comparison data sets for interpreting the results of trials combining chemotherapy with aemitting radiopharmaceuticals.8
Full doses of 153Sm-EDTMP and docetaxel can be
given together as ongoing therapy in chemotherapy-naive,
chemotherapy-exposed, and chemotherapy-refractory
patients. The results of the current study provide encouraging preliminary efficacy to support the development of
combination strategies of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals with chemotherapy. Although the hematologic toxicity noted in the current study was manageable, the
anticipated availability of radium-223, which has been
shown to be minimally toxic to the bone marrow,
provides even greater enthusiasm for combination regimens targeting both the tumor and the bone stroma.
