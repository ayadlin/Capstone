Abstract
Autophagy is frequently activated in radioresistant cancer cells where it provides a cell survival strategy. The
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin activates autophagy but paradoxically it also enhances radiosensitivity. In this study,
we investigated the mechanisms of these opposing actions in radiation-resistant glioma or parotid carcinoma
cells. Radiation treatment transiently enhanced autophagic ﬂux for a period of 72 hours in these cells and
treatment with rapamycin or the mTOR inhibitor PP242 potentiated this effect. However, these treatments also
increased heterochromatin formation, irreversible growth arrest, and premature senescence, as deﬁned by
expression of senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity. This augmentation in radiosensitivity seemed to
result from a restoration in the activity of the tumor suppressor RB and a suppression of RB-mediated E2F target
genes. In tumor xenografts, we showed that administering rapamycin delayed tumor regrowth after irradiation
and increased senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining in the tumor. Our ﬁndings suggest that a potent
and persistent activation of autophagy by mTOR inhibitors, even in cancer cells where autophagy is occurring, can
trigger premature senescence as a method to restore radiosensitivity. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4267–77. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Radiotherapy is a well-established therapeutic modality
used in treatment of many cancers. However, the presence of
radioresistant cells is one of the major obstacles to successful treatment with radiotherapy. Autophagy is a process in
which intracellular double membranes sequester long-lived
proteins and organelles for degradation and turnover (1, 2).
While autophagy can lead to cell death in some circumstances, it can also serve as a survival mechanism providing
metabolic support in times of cellular stress such as exposure to radiation. Thus, activation of autophagic pathways
can limit the efﬁcacy of radiotherapy, serving as a resistance
mechanism.

Recent studies have suggested that inhibitors targeting the
mTOR can sensitize cells to the effects of radiation (3, 4). mTOR
plays a critical role in tumor development, invasion, and
metastasis, acting as a signal integrator that modulates permissive signals from various pathways and a diversity of
growth-promoting processes (5). The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and its analogs have been shown to induce autophagy,
which somewhat paradoxically is associated with its radiosensitizing effects (6–8). The mechanisms by which autophagy
can mediate both radiation resistance and radiosensitivity
when radiation and mTOR inhibitor are combined remain to
be elucidated.
Cellular senescence is an irreversible state of cell-cycle
arrest, which was originally described by the replicative
exhaustion of human diploid ﬁbroblasts in culture (9).
Senescence can be induced prematurely in cells under
cytotoxic stresses such as chemotherapeutic drugs, irradiation, and UV (10, 11), and upon oncogenic stress by overexpression of Ras oncogene (12, 13). It is speculated that
premature senescence can act as a tumor suppressor mechanism that removes cells harboring DNA damage from the
proliferative state (14). Consistent with its role in suppressing cancer, cellular senescence can accompany autophagy
induced by cellular stress and starvation. Recent reports
suggest that autophagy might serve as a switch to shift
the cell fate from apoptosis to senescence (15) and provide
protection as a prosenescence mechanism against the
tumorigenic activity of the oncogene (16). Although functional links between these two stress response mechanisms
remain elusive, senescence and autophagy are implicated in
cancer and aging.

We report that combining mTOR inhibitor with radiotherapy induces cellular senescence in in vitro radioresistant
cancer cells and in xenograft model. To the best of our
knowledge, this study provides the ﬁrst evidence that promoting cellular senescence via inhibition of the mTOR pathway
may enhance efﬁciency of radiotherapy. Knowledge of how a
long-lasting autophagic ﬂux through inhibition of mTOR
activity is integrated into the development of cellular senescence will help our understanding of the role of senescence in
the response to anticancer treatments.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The AMC-HN-9 cells used in the study were established
from undifferentiated primary head and neck cancer isolated from a patient treated at the Asan Medical Center (Seoul,
Korea; ref. 17) and have been authenticated as a result of
sequencing. To evaluate the response of AMC-HN-9 cells to
radiation, we selected multiple cancer cells that obtained
from American Type Culture Collection according to their
clonal radiosensitivity (18, 19). These included the radioresistant U-87 and U251 (human glioma-derived), A549 (lung
carcinoma), and HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell
lines, and the relatively radiosensitive MDA-MB-231 (breast
cancer) cell line. AMC-HN-9 and U251 cells were cultured in
Minimum Essential Medium (MEM-a; Invitrogen) and
RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen), respectively. U-87, A549, HT-29,
and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Invitrogen). In all cases, media contained 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 100 mg/mL of penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5%
CO2 atmosphere. Cells were grown to approximately 70%
conﬂuency and were irradiated using 6-MV photon beam
generated by a linear accelerator (CLINAC 600C; Varian) at a
dose rate of 2 Gy/min. All reagents were purchased from
Sigma, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Cells were treated with
autophagy regulators for 1 hour and then exposed to the
indicated dose of radiation.
Cellular proliferation and real-time monitoring of cell
growth
Cell viability was determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo Molecular Technology, Inc.) or by measuring 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation (Roche Applied
Science), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cell
survival, expressed as a percentage, was calculated relative to
that of control cells.
Time-dependent cell response proﬁling was conducted
using the xCELLigence RT-CA DP System (ACEA Biosciences)
as described by the manufacturer. Brieﬂy, cells exposed to
radiation were harvested after 18 hours and transferred to a 96well E-Plate (6,000 cells/well). The cells were monitored by
measuring electrical impedance every 10 minutes for 2 hours
and then every hour for 72 to 96 hours. Continuous recording of
impedance in cells was represented by the cell index (CI) value,
which is correlated with dynamic changes in the number,
morphology, and physiology of cells attached to the bottom
of the plate (20, 21). Each treatment was conducted in qua-

druplicate to obtain an average value, and the SD was obtained
using software provided with the instrument. The growth rate
of treated cells was determined by measuring the slope of the
maximal CI value for cells.
Xenograft model
To determine antitumoral activities in combination of
rapamycin and irradiation, ﬂank xenografts were established
in 5-to 6-week-old male athymic nude mice (nu/nu; HarlanSprague-Dawley) by subcutaneous injection of 1  107 AMCHN-9 cells. When tumors reached approximately50 mm3,
animals with established xenografts were stratiﬁed by tumor
volume and randomized into 4 treatment groups: (i) control,
vehicle; (ii) radiation only; (iii) 1 mg/kg rapamycin only intraperitoneally daily for 7 days; and (iv) rapamycin þ radiation. All
mice were treated for 1 week with 5 to 6 mice per group and
sacriﬁced after approximately 6 weeks of treatment. For irradiation, unanesthetized animals were immobilized in a lead jig
that shielded the head, thorax, and upper abdomen. Radiation
was delivered with 4 or 8 Gy, using a 6-MV therapeutic linear
accelerator (CLINAC EX; Varian) at a dose rate of 2 Gy/min; 1.0
cm bolus was used for radiation dose buildup. For rapamycin
injections, stock rapamycin was prepared ﬁrst in 10 mg/mL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted in sterile 0.9%
saline before use. To ensure that mTOR would be fully inhibited
at the time of irradiation, rapamycin was administrated once a
day for two days before starting the course of radiotherapy. All
animal experiments were approved by and carried out according to the Laboratory of Animal Research, Asan Institute for life
Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using unpaired, twotailed Student t tests (n ¼ 3). Differences with P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant and the P value of
tests was provided in the ﬁgure legends. Values were expressed
as means  SDs.

Results
AMC-HN-9 cells are resistant to irradiation-induced
effects on survival, proliferation, and cell cycle
AMC-HN-9 cells used in this study were derived from a
highly aggressive head and neck cancer that was resistant
to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as evidenced by a lack
of apoptotic cell death and an increase in DNA damage
repair proteins and antioxidants after radiation. (22, 23). To
verify the response of AMC-HN-9 cells to irradiation, we
compared their clonogenic survival following irradiation
with that of several radioresistant (A549, HT-29, U251, and
U-87) and radiosensitive (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines.
As expected, AMC-HN-9 cells were as resistant to radiation
as were other known resistant cell lines (A549, U251, and U87; ref. 19), but were much more resistant than some other
cell lines (MDA-MB-231, and HT-29; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To examine whether radiation exposure induces apoptotic
changes, apoptotic cell death was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry

Figure 1. Characteristic resistance responses in AMC-HN-9 cells exposed to radiation. AMC-HN-9 cells were exposed to graded doses of radiation. Survival
curves, apoptotic cell death, cell-cycle distribution, and cellular proliferation were analyzed. A, the survival curve for AMC-HN-9 cells was compared
with those from other tumor cell lines deﬁned as radioresistant (U-87, U251, A549, and HT-29) or radiosensitive (MDA-MB-231). Values in curves are presented
as mean values. Experiments were carried out at least 3 times. B and C, cells exposed to increasing doses of radiation were harvested at 48 hours
and the cells positive for Annexin V staining and cell-cycle distribution were assessed by ﬂow cytometric analyses. D, irradiated cells were transferred
to an E-plate and cellular proliferation was monitored for 72 hours in real-time using an xCELLigence system. Cell index (CI) value obtained from
each well represents the level of growth, proliferation, and cytotoxic effects of cells to radiation. All data are representative of at least 3 experiments.

analysis. The level of Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells gradually increased with increase in radiation dose, but most cells
survived 48 hours (82%  3.74) after exposure to high doses of
radiation (16 Gy, Fig. 1B). Cell-cycle analysis revealed that 4
and 8 Gy induced a G1-phase arrest 48 hours after irradiation
and accumulation of a G2–M phase cell population was
induced as doses of radiation increased (Fig. 1C). However,
irradiation (4–16 Gy) did not increase the sub-G1 fraction
corresponding to apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA content (data not shown).
To continuously monitor the cellular response to increasing doses of ionizing radiation (4–16 Gy), we used the

lular proliferation and cytotoxic effects to CI values. As the
radiation dose increased, the growth slope of irradiated
AMC-HN-9 cells increased more rapidly compared with
control cells approximately 40 hours after plating, and CI
values also reached earlier maximal levels in proportion to
radiation dose. After reaching a peak, CI values of irradiated
cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner at 72 hours
(Fig. 1D). This growth proﬁle suggests that radioresistant
AMC-HN-9 cells undergo robust changes in cellular morphology and physiology, including changes in gene expression and metabolic proﬁles, at early periods of irradiation.
Thereafter, the cells showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic
effect.

Irradiation-induced autophagy represents a survival
mode that protects AMC-HN-9 cells against the
consequences of radiation exposure
We next examined the morphology of AMC-HN-9 cells with
transmission electron microscopy. As reported in previous
studies, autophagosomes were frequently found at a basal
level in untreated AMC-HN-9 cells. Irradiation with 4 Gy
induced a dramatic increase in the number of autolysosomes
containing cytoplasmic structures, lamellar structures, or
undigested material (Fig. 1E). In cells treated with a higher
dose of irradiation (12 Gy), large degradation vacuoles were
often present and almost all mitochondria were small and
swollen. Immunolabeling for LC3 protein also revealed an
increase in cytosolic LC3 as well as an increase in LC3 localized
to autophagosomal membranes (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The increase in autophagy structures correlated with
dynamic changes in the autophagy regulatory proteins, ATG5,
p62, and LC3 II; LC3 II is a lipidated form of LC3 I bound to the
autophagosome membrane. As shown in Fig. 1F, the level of
ATG5 expression began to increase from 12 hours after irradiation and maintained up to 72 hours. However, the levels of
LC3 II and p62 were decreased at 2 to 24 hours after irradiation,
indicating active protein turnover within the autolysosome.
After transiently increasing at 48 hours, the level of LC3 II
returned to that observed in control cells.
Following irradiation at 4 Gy, Ser-15–phosphorylated p53
levels increased rapidly (2 hours) and decreased slightly at 72
hours, whereas p53-induced p21 was maintained for up to 72
hours (Fig. 1F). Consistent with the observation that a sub-G1
apoptotic fraction was rarely detected in irradiated cells, active
caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and apoptotic morphologic signs,
such as nuclear fragmentation and plasma membrane blebbing, were also absent (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Collectively,
these results show that the AMC-HN-9 cells activate the
autophagy process as an early protective mechanism against
radiation damage, in which the cells go through rapid and
dose-dependent restorative responses, such as a transient
arrest of the cell cycle and a decrease of cellular proliferation.

on cellular proliferation by 63% for rapamycin and 73% for
PP242, respectively, compared with nontreated control cells at
maximally effective concentrations (Fig. 2B). To further assess
the effect of mTOR inhibition with time, we monitored cell
proliferation in real time. As shown in Fig. 2C, combined
treatment with mTOR inhibitor and irradiation induced persistent growth inhibition in the all observed periods, which was
evidenced by dramatically decreased CI values (rapamycin,
57%; PP242, 30%) at 72 hours. When used alone, neither mTOR
inhibitor decreased CI values compared with untreated control
cells. The inhibitory effect on cellular proliferation and growth
caused by rapamycin or PP242 was conﬁrmed by using clonogenic survival assays as an endpoint (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To determine the cellular mechanism by which mTOR
inhibitors increase the radiosensitivity of AMC-HN-9 cells, we
investigated the effects of mTOR inhibitor treatment and
irradiation on the mTOR downstream pathway. Both drugs
effectively suppressed the phosphorylation of established
mTOR targets (p70S6K, 4E-BP, and AKT) and induced activation of autophagy. A relatively low dose of radiation treatment
(4 Gy) had no clear regulatory effect on mTOR downstream
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). However, when combined with mTOR inhibitor, high level of LC3 II and longlastingly decreased p62 was observed to 72 hours after radiation indicating the maintenance of enhanced autophagic ﬂux
(Fig. 2E). Interestingly, while a single treatment of rapamycin or
radiation increased the number of autophagic vacuoles for an
early period (from 8 to 48 hours) and declined at 72 hours,
combinational treatment maintained a slightly increased
autophagic ﬂux to 72 hours after radiation (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). Taken together, these results suggest that radiationinduced autophagy occurs independently of the mTOR pathway, but inactivation of the pathway by mTOR inhibitor
augments long-term autophagic ﬂux in irradiated AMC-HN9 cells, ultimately sensitizing the cells to irradiation. This may
trigger another mechanism that enables cells to suppress the
emergence of radioresistance.

mTOR inhibition improves the efﬁcacy of radiation
treatment by augmenting autophagic ﬂux in AMC-HN-9
cells
Cancer cells dynamically regulate autophagic ﬂux to protect
themselves against external stress. During anticancer therapy,
this response may be cytoprotective or harmful to cancer cells,
depending on the cellular context or the extent of stress. We
assessed the effect of further enhancement of autophagy
induction on the response to subsequent irradiation exposure.
A greater degree of autophagy activation was achieved by
targeting mTOR with two mechanistically different inhibitors,
rapamycin and PP242 (24, 25). The regulatory effects of mTOR
inhibitors were assessed by microscopic examination, measurement of BrdUrd incorporation, and analysis of cell growth
proﬁles and cell survival. Rapamycin and PP242 decreased
cellular proliferation with distinguishable changes in cellular
morphology. Cells appeared ﬂattened and enlarged or lean
shaped for rapamycin or PP242, respectively (Fig. 2A). When
combined with irradiation, the drugs induced inhibitory effects

The combination of mTOR inhibition and irradiation
induces a cell-cycle block and an irreversible
proliferation arrest
To understand how the combined mTOR inhibition and
irradiation induce a decrease in cell growth and survival, and to
determine whether the growth-arrested state can be reversed,
we examined cell-cycle kinetics in irradiated and/or mTOR
inhibitor-treated cells. As depicted in Fig. 3A (top), AMC-HN-9
cells that had been cultured with an mTOR inhibitor and/or
exposed to radiation for 3 days were harvested, replated with
fresh complete media without mTOR inhibitor, and then
maintained for another 3 days. This strategy was designed to
avoid cell-cycle arrest and the resulting growth inhibition
caused by a high degree of cell conﬂuence. Cells treated with
a combination of mTOR inhibitor and radiation were in a state
arrested in G1 phase (rapamycin, 58%) or G1–G2 phase (PP242,
54%/18%) at 6 days (Fig. 3A, bottom). In contrast, cells treated
with mTOR inhibitor alone, which had accumulated in the G1
phase at 3 days before replating, reentered S and G2–M phases

the cells were freed from G1 arrest and were restored to a cellcycle pattern similar to that of control cells. The arrested state
of cells was conﬁrmed by measuring population doubling time
(PDT), which was remarkably increased in irradiated cells that
also received rapamycin (6-fold) or PP242 (19-fold), compared
with cells treated with radiation alone (2-fold; Fig. 3B).
Next, we determined whether the arrested cell population
was responsive to mitogenic stimuli, such as serum or growth
factors. Insulin was added to the treated cells, and cell proliferation was continuously monitored for 3 days using the
xCELLigence system. As shown in Fig. 3C, insulin treatment
promoted the growth of irradiated cells and cells treated with
rapamycin or PP242 alone. However, it did not change growth
curves of cells exposed to combined treatment of mTOR
inhibitor and irradiation, indicating that the arrested cells are

results show that the combination of mTOR inhibition and

cells unresponsive to growth stimuli.
Downregulation of the mTOR pathway in cooperation
with radiotherapy induces cellular senescence and
heterochromatin formation
Microscopic examination showed that combination-treated
cells exhibited a senescence-like morphology (Fig. 2A). To
investigate whether mTOR inhibition is associated with the
induction of senescence in irradiated cells, we measured SAb-gal activity, which is the most widely used marker of senescence (26). Very few SA-b-gal–positive cells were found among
cells treated with rapamycin (1.4  0.15-fold) or PP242 (1.6 
0.55-fold) alone. However, as shown in Fig. 4A, pretreatment
with rapamycin (3.5  0.36-fold, P < 0.004) or PP242 (2.7  0.45fold, P < 0.05) increased the number of senescent cells compared with that induced by irradiation alone (2.1  0.23-fold).

To identify possible changes in chromatin structure that are
known to contribute to cellular senescence, we examined
heterochromatin organization in cells. The number of cells
positive for senescence-associated heterochromatin foci
(SAHF) increased more in cells treated with an mTOR inhibitor
(rapamycin or PP242) alone than in cells exposed to radiation
alone. However, these differences were not statistically significance. Cells exposed to combined treatment with mTOR
inhibitor and radiation showed a clear difference when compared with nontreated control cells [rapamycin (P < 0.05) or
PP242 (P < 0.01); Fig. 4B]. Furthermore, these morphologic
changes were associated with increases in chromatin-bound
HMGA2 protein and H3(K9)met, as shown in Fig. 4C (left).
mTOR inhibitors increased the levels of HMGA2 and H3(K9)
met expression in cells subjected to subsequent irradiation,
even though the only drug treatment were insufﬁcient to
increase expression of the proteins. We next determined the
subcellular localization of H3(K9)met using immunoﬂuorescence. H3(K9)met staining was diffuse throughout the nucleus
in control cells. In contrast, as senescence was induced, cells
showed an increase in H3(K9)met localized to the condensed
regions of DNA, exhibiting an intense yellow ﬂuorescence on
merged images (Fig. 4C, right). The changes in these pheno-

mTOR inhibitor-induced senescence is associated with
the RB tumor suppression pathway
The insensitivity of senescent cells to mitogenic signals,
noted above, might be due to the combined action of p53
and p16-RB tumor suppressor networks (27). To test this
possibility, we further examined the molecular characteristics of senescence induced in AMC-HN-9 cells. As shown
in Fig. 4D, cells treated with mTOR inhibitor alone exhibited
no noticeable change in phosphorylated p53 or induction of
the p53 target, p21. mTOR inhibitor rather induced slight
decrease in the p53 pathway, implying suppression at the
translational levels due to downregulation of the mTOR
pathway. These results were in contrast with the results
from cells exposed to radiation, which showed high levels of
p53 and p21 expression during the experimental time. This
indicates that the activated p53-21 is a damage response
against irradiation.
As a tumor suppressor, RB is another important regulator
of senescence programs, in addition to its ability to halt

The senescent cells that were treated together with mTOR

a decreased state of RB phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of RB was restored to control levels in the cells

Furthermore, the expression of RB-bound E2F-responsive

of RB and the stable repression of E2F target genes may
be involved in maintenance of senescence in cells. However,
it was difﬁcult to detect activation of the p38 kinase pathway, although many reports have noted that p38 MAPK
activation occurs independently of critical shortening of
telomeres, and therefore represents stress-induced senescence (29). These results collectively indicate that mTOR
inhibitor-induced senescence is associated with the RB
tumor suppression pathway rather than with activation of
the p53 pathway.

Rapamycin injection increased the levels of HMGA2 and H3
(K9)met expression in xenograft subjected to subsequent
irradiation (Fig. 5D). However, we investigated that only a
subset and not the majority of AMC-HN-9 cells seem to
response that way, which indicated signiﬁcant cellular heterogeneity with the tumor cells. These data suggest that combination therapy with rapamycin and radiation was more
effective than either radiation alone or rapamycin alone and
that the antitumoral effect has relevance to senescence
induced in irradiated AMC-HN-9 xenografts.
In conclusion, we report that maximum efﬁcacy of radiotherapy could be achieved by triggering autophagy induction
and premature senescence through concomitant inhibition of
the mTOR pathway.

mTOR inhibition increases the sensitivity to irradiation
via senescence induction in AMC-HN-9 xenografts
Having established the in vitro effects of combined mTOR
inhibitor and irradiation on sensitivity of radioresistant cancer
cells, the biologic efﬁcacy of combined treatment was tested in
tumor regrowth delay using AMC-HN-9 ﬂank xenografts established in nude mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, control tumors grew
rapidly with a volume doubling time of approximately 7 days.
High doses of radiation (8 Gy) did not affect tumor growth rate
compared with 4 Gy radiation although it decreased clonogenic survival of AMC-HN-9 cells in vitro (Fig. 1A). However,
rapamycin enhanced the efﬁcacy of radiation: combination
therapy of rapamycin and radiation resulted in a noticeable
tumor growth delay, 18 days and 30 days, compared with
irradiation of 4 Gy and 8 Gy, respectively. Mouse body weight
monitoring suggested that all treatments were relatively well
tolerated (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, combination of radiation (8
Gy) and rapamycin showed stronger b-gal staining in tumor
sections than those of other treatment groups (Fig. 5C).

mTOR Inhibitor and Senescence in Radiotherapy

inhibition of the mTOR pathway maintains a growth-arrested
state in response to radiation by inducing a senescence phenotype through cell-cycle blockage and heterochromatin
formation.
To better understand the radiosensitizing effects of mTOR
inhibitor in radioresistant AMC-HN-9 cells bearing wild-type
p53, we evaluated the biologic characteristics of cells after
treatment with radiation or mTOR inhibitor. Exposure to
radiation rapidly activated the p53-p21 signaling pathway,
resulting in arrest of cells at the G1 or G2–M phases of the
cell cycle and growth inhibition in a dose-responsive manner.
The cells were highly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin
and PP242), showing the distinct downregulation signatures of
mTOR activity. Furthermore, the cells possessed intact autophagy machinery that was dynamically activated by exposure to
radiation or the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) and that was effectively controlled by autophagy
inhibitors or by genetic abrogation of the autophagy-related
gene, ATG7 (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4D). We postulate
that transiently increased autophagic ﬂux and the corresponding temporary growth arrest might be a survival mode that
protects cells against radiation, increases stress tolerance, and
delays the onset of apoptosis.
Recent evidence links autophagy to another stress response,
senescence. It is shown that autophagy mediates the transition
to a senescent phenotype by promoting highly efﬁcient protein
turnover and the translation of proteins necessary for senescence establishment (16, 30). Recently, Narita and colleagues
(2011) showed the spatial coupling compartment of mTOR
autophagy during Ras-induced senescence (31). The cellular
localization could augment their respective functions and
contribute to establishment of secretory phenotypes (31). On
the other hands, another study reported that autophagy and
senescence responses may occur independently without inexorable link, because senescence can develop when autophagy is
abrogated (32). In principle, combining radiation with inhibition of the mTOR pathway might induce a distinctive autophagy type, resulting in autophagic cell death. Alternatively, a
certain threshold could be attained at which cells select
another salvage pathway that avoids autophagy and averts
cell death. Interestingly, the combination of mTOR inhibitor
and irradiation did not induce a noticeable additive or synergic
effect on autophagy activation, but consolidated the autophagic ﬂux and growth-arrested state in the in vitro model of
autophagic cell survival. Taken together, AMC-HN-9 cells are
likely to use autophagy as an effector mechanism to provide
nutrients and energy needed for the establishment of
senescence.
Several inhibitors targeting the mTOR-AKT pathway have
been developed as attractive therapeutic strategies for cancer
treatment (24, 33). However, how mTOR inhibitors exert an
acceptable therapeutic effect, and more importantly, what
potential beneﬁts such inhibitors might provide in combination therapy with radiation, remain to be established. We
observed that downregulation of the mTOR pathway inhibited
G1–S progression. This indicates that the proliferative potential of cells is not only decreased, but the cells become more
sensitive to the following irradiation (34, 35). Another possi-

bility, based on evidence that both radiation and mTOR
inhibitors induce the autophagy process, is that radiation
increases autophagic ﬂux as part of a cytoprotective response
mediated by p53, but via the mTOR-independent pathway.
Boosting the autophagic ﬂux at the level of mTOR signaling
using inhibitor may dominantly lead to a transition of irradiated cancer cells to senescent status. Herein, we showed that
inhibition of the mTOR pathway could create a precondition of
premature senescence as cancer therapeutic mechanism.
More studies are required to determine a possible link between
autophagy and senescence, and to distinguish a radiationresponsive, mTOR-independent autophagy from autophagy
induced by combinational treatment with mTOR inhibitor.
However, it was technically difﬁcult to assort two types of
autophagy at the level of autophagic processes.
It is known that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin converts
senescent into quiescent cells in human ﬁbroblasts (36), and
results in antiaging effects that can increase the lifespan of
mice (37). However, this effect of rapamycin is fundamentally
different from that modeled in this study in an anticancer
therapeutic context. In our study, mTOR inhibitors improved
the efﬁcacy of the therapeutic modality against radioresistant
cancer cells by triggering a senescence-like growth arrest
program.
In tumor cells, chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation accelerates cellular senescence, by which entering a state of
permanent cell-cycle arrest can constitute a potent tumorsuppressive mechanism. However, it is not clear whether
senescence is indeﬁnite, transient, or transient but with the
potential for proliferative recovery. Under certain conditions,
senescent cells may turn into a dormant phenotype capable of
causing tumor resurgence (38, 39). Moreover, it is well established that senescent cells can promote various facets of cancer
progression, which create a permissive tumor microenvironment allowing nonsenescence tumor cells to thrive (40).
Indeed, our results showing that not all cells with combinational modality exhibited senescence features indicate the
possibility for presence of cells escaped from senescence.
Alternatively, due to the heterogeneity of the tumor cell
population, even if exposed to same anticancer therapeutics,
some tumor cells may not come under a relationship between
autophagy and senescence established in our study. Thus,
clinically relevant concept that at least a small subpopulation
of tumor cells regains the ability to reenter the cell cycle or
incurs unexpected responses to chemotherapeutic modalities
would be considered in implicating the responses of autophagy
and senescence in patients with cancer.
Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferation arrested
state, but the reasons for which have only partially been
elucidated. Consistent with the role in suppressing cancer,
two major tumor suppressors, p53 and RB, govern senescence
program in human cells (41). Skinner and colleagues (2012)
reported that p53 activity, and in some cases protein levels,
increases radiation-induced senescence with radiosensitivity
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (42). We observed
that combination of mTOR inhibitor and radiation caused
ATM and CHK2 activation in AMC-HN-9 cells (data not
shown), which could trigger entry into ATM/p53-mediated

senescence by imposing a cell-cycle block via activation of p53
and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (11, 43). Thus,
we regarded that the constant activation of p53 and p21 in
senescent cells can contribute to the maintenance of premature senescence by inhibiting the mTOR pathway or locking
cell-cycle arrest (44, 45).
Besides the p53 pathway, RB has been suggested as another
senescence regulator. The active nonphosphorylated form of
RB is an initiator of SAHF formation that are believed to
contribute to stable repression of genes such as cyclin A and
stabilization of senescence-associated cell-cycle arrest (46–48).
Furthermore, RB can induce autophagy by repressing E2F1
activity (49), suggesting that RB/E2F1pathway has a dual role
in cancer suppression and resistance to cancer therapy. Given
the critical role that RB plays during cellular senescence and in
the response to cancer therapeutics such as CDK inhibitors
(50), there might be a link between RB-mediated autophagy
and senescence and in consequential tumor suppression. We
suggest a model in which RB activation triggered by radiation
and mTOR inhibitor induces autophagy and reinforces a
growth-arrested state via heterochromatin formation and
permanent cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To address concerns about the cell line used, we determined
whether combining mTOR inhibitor with radiation would
induce premature senescence in radioresistant U-87 cells that
undergo autophagy-dependent survival after radiation. Similar
to results observed for AMC-HN-9 cells, mTOR inhibitors
induced the formation of heterochromatin foci and increased
the expression of HMGA2 and H3K9(met). The following
irradiation increased the senescent phenotypes, such as SAb-gal activity, heterochromatin formation, and decreased cell
growth. In addition, it prevented inactivation of hypophosphorylated RB and decreased the level of cyclin A expression
(Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C).
In summary, this study indicates that radiation treatment
combined with mTOR inhibitor induces an irreversible

growth-arrested state via p53 and RB-E2F pathways with a
persistent autophagic ﬂux. Our results provide a source for
integrative understanding the senescence program on radiosensitivity of cancer and for new insight into mTOR targeting
as an adjuvant method of radiotherapy.
