Abstract
Author Manuscript

The immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for a wide range of
leukocytes, including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells1–3. Considerable effort has been
invested using IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for a variety of immune disorders ranging from AIDS to
cancer. However, adverse effects have limited its use in the clinic. On activated T cells, IL-2
signals through a quaternary “high affinity” receptor complex consisting of IL-2, IL-2Rα (termed
CD25), IL-2Rβ, and γc4–8. Naïve T cells express only a low density of IL-2Rβ and γc, and are
therefore relatively insensitive to IL-2, but acquire sensitivity after CD25 expression, which
captures the cytokine and presents it to IL-2Rβ andγc. Here, using in vitro evolution, we
eliminated IL-2’s functional requirement for CD25 expression by engineering an IL-2 “superkine”
(termed super-2) with increased binding affinity for IL-2Rβ. Crystal structures of super-2 in free
and receptor-bound forms showed that the evolved mutations are principally in the core of the

cytokine, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the evolved mutations stabilized
IL-2, including a flexible helix in the IL-2Rβ binding site, into an optimized receptor-binding
conformation resembling that when bound to CD25. The evolved mutations in super-2
recapitulated the functional role of CD25 by eliciting potent phosphorylation of STAT5 and
vigorous proliferation T cells irrespective of CD25 expression. Compared to IL-2, super-2 induced
superior expansion of cytotoxic T cells, leading to improved anti-tumor responses in vivo, and
elicited proportionally less expansion of T regulatory cells and reduced pulmonary edema.
Collectively, we show that in vitro evolution has mimicked the functional role of CD25 in
enhancing IL-2 potency and regulating target cell specificity, which has implications for
immunotherapy.

Affinity maturation of IL-2 for IL-2Rβ

Author Manuscript

In order to engineer a CD25-independent version of IL-2, we displayed human IL-2 on the
surface of yeast as a conjugate to Aga2p, and verified proper receptor binding properties
with IL-2R β and γc ectodomain tetramers that were C-terminally biotinylated and coupled
to phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin for use as a staining and sorting reagent9,10. Yeastdisplayed IL-2 bound to γc in the presence of IL-2Rβ, recapitulating the cooperative
assembly of the heterodimeric receptor complex as seen with soluble IL-2 (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 1). We proceeded to carry out two generations of in vitro evolution (Fig.
1b, Supplementary Fig. 2). Our first generation in vitro evolution strategy was to create an
error-prone PCR library of the entire IL-2 coding sequence (Supplementary Fig. 2), which
resulted in selection of a predominant IL-2 variant containing an L85V mutation (Fig 1c,
Supplementary Fig. 3).

Author Manuscript

From inspection of the wild-type (WT) IL-2 structure, we were surprised to find that
position 85 was not a direct IL-2Rβ contact residue, but rather resided on the internal face of
the IL-2 C-helix, within the hydrophobic core of the cytokine (Fig. 2a). Thus, we surmised
that L85V may affect the structure of helix C in a way that enhances binding to IL-2Rβ.
Therefore, we carried out a second generation selection where we made a biased library that
contained F/I/L/V at amino acids L80, L85, I86, I89, I92, and V93, which are contained
within the hydrophobic core and linker region on helix C (Fig. 1b,c). To rapidly select the
most active variants, we used the yeast-displayed cytokines themselves to stimulate STAT5
phosphorylation in the human NK cell line YT-1 by coincubation at varying yeast:YT-1 cell
ratios (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig. 4). Several clones stimulated substantially more STAT5
phosphorylation at lower yeast:cell ratios than yeast-displayed WT IL-2 (Fig 1d,
Supplementary Fig. 4). Sequencing of a selected panel of high-affinity IL-2 clones revealed
a consensus set of mutations L80F/R81D/L85V/I86V/I92F (Fig 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3).
Structure and comparison with WT IL-2
We expressed recombinant forms of several first and second-generation IL-2 clones in order
to measure their binding affinities and kinetics for IL-2Rβ by surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs 3 and 5) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
(Supplementary Fig. 6). By SPR, the affinity between IL-2 and IL-2Rβ was KD = 280 nM.

The IL-2 superkines, termed “super-2s”, clustered into low, medium, and high affinity
classes. The highest affinity mutants had KDs of 1.2–1.7 nM (D10, H9). The affinity
increases were uniformly manifested in reductions in off-rates (Fig 1c, Supplementary Figs
3 and 5).

Author Manuscript

In order to understand the structural consequences of the evolved mutations, we crystallized
the D10 super-2 (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 7a, and Supplementary Table 1). In the
structure of D10 alone, five of the six mutations clustered on the B-C loop and within the Chelix core, in positions that did not contact IL-2Rβ. Notably, the B-C-helix linker region was
ordered in the electron density map (Supplementary Figs 7a and 8a), compared to other IL-2
structures where this region is often disordered (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Collectively, the
F80, V85, and V86 substitutions appeared to collapse into a hydrophobic cluster that
stabilized the loop by pinning the C-helix into the core of the molecule. Only one of the five
consensus mutations, I92F, was at a position that contacted IL-2Rβ in the receptor complex
(Fig. 2a), but it was deeply inserted between the C and A helices, contributing only an
additional 10Å2 of molecular surface buried by IL-2Rβ in the complex compared to Ile92.
We also determined a low-resolution (3.8 Å) structure of the D10 ternary receptor complex
to assess whether the mutations have perturbed the IL-2Rβ/γc receptor dimer geometry
compared to the WT IL-2 complex (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1). The overall IL-2Rβ/γc
heterodimeric architecture and mode of cytokine/IL-2Rβ contact in the D10 ternary complex
were essentially identical to the previously reported IL-2 quaternary assembly (RMSD =
0.43 Å) (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

Author Manuscript

Previously, we found that the C-helix of IL-2 appears to undergo subtle repositioning upon
binding to IL-2Rα11 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8a). Inspection of three WT unliganded
IL-2 structures revealed conformational variability in the C-helix position, consistent with
higher crystallographic B-factors in this helix relative to the rest of the molecule
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). We compared the structure of our D10 super-2 to that of an
unliganded structure of IL-2, and IL-2 in the receptor complexes. We found that the C-helix
in D10 was more similar to that seen in the two receptor-bound conformations of IL-2 than
the free forms, having undergone a relatively small shift towards the helical core as a
consequence of the stabilizing mutations (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of IL-2 and D10 to further interrogate the
mechanism responsible for higher binding affinity to IL-2Rβ by super-2 (Fig. 2d,e). We
constructed an atomically detailed Markov state model (MSM) in order to directly probe the
relative conformational flexibility of IL-2 versus D10. Analysis of the MSM clearly
demonstrated that D10 was more stable than IL-2, and that IL-2 visited nearly twice as many
clusters as D10. For example, D10’s most populated state had an equilibrium probability of
~0.20, compared to ~0.05 for IL-2, demonstrating that D10’s equilibrium population was far
more localized than IL-2. Helix B, the B-C loop, and helix C appeared rigidified in D10
compared to IL-2 as evidenced by reduced RMSD from the starting conformations (Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Movies 1, 2). F92 appeared to act as a molecular wedge between helix C and
helix A, stabilizing the more C-terminal end of the helix (Fig. 2a). We also simulated both
D10 and IL-2 starting in a receptor-bound-like structure and monitored the divergence in
RMSD of the B-C loop and helix C from the actual receptor-bound structure. IL-2 (Fig. 2e-

left, Supplementary Fig. 8c) quickly “wandered” from the receptor conformation and
experienced drastic fluctuations compared to D10 (Fig. 2e-right, Supplementary Fig. 8c,
Supplementary Movies 1, 2). Based on these observations, we propose a mechanism
whereby the reduced flexibility of helix C in super-2, as a result of its improved core
packing with helix B, results in a superior receptor-binding poise that increases its affinity
for IL-2Rβ, and consequently mimics a functional role of CD25. The structural and MD
results suggest that the evolved mutations in super-2 cause a conformational stabilization of
the cytokine, that reduces the energetic penalties for binding to IL-2Rβ.
Stimulation of NK cells

Author Manuscript

We asked if the super-2s demonstrated signaling potencies on cells in accordance with their
IL-2Rβ binding affinities, and whether their activities depended on cell surface expression of
CD25. We determined the dose-response relationships of WT IL-2 versus the super-2s 6-6,
D10, and H9 on both CD25− and CD25+ human YT-1 NK cells by assaying STAT5
phosphorylation with flow cytometry (Fig. 3a–d, Supplementary Fig. 9). On CD25− YT-1
cells, the EC50 of H9 and D10 were decreased over 10-fold (EC50 = 2.5 and 1.8 ng/mL,
respectively) compared to IL-2 (EC50 = 39 ng/mL), with the 6-6 mutein yielding an EC50
intermediate between IL-2 and H9/D10 (EC50 = 15 ng/mL), consistent with the improved
affinity of the super-2s for IL-2Rβ (Fig. 3a). On CD25+ YT-1 cells, the EC50 of IL-2
decreased over 50-fold relative to CD25− YT-1 cells, from 39 to 0.66 ng/mL (Fig. 3b). In
contrast, the EC50 of H9 and D10 improved only modestly in the presence of CD25 (EC50 of
0.47 and 0.52 compared to 2.5 and 1.8 ng/mL, respectively) (Fig. 3b).

Author Manuscript

We sought to further probe the CD25-independence of the super-2s by taking advantage of a
previously characterized mutation in IL-2, Phe42 to Ala (F42A), which showed reduced
binding to CD25 by ~220-fold for H9 (KD 6.6 nM versus 1.4 μM) and ~120-fold for IL-2
(KD 6.6 nM versus 0.8 μM) (Supplementary Fig. 10)12,13. The F42A mutation is an
alternative diagnostic probe of the relative CD25 dependence of IL-2 and super-2. The F42A
mutation right-shifted the dose-response curve of WT IL-2 on CD25+ cells by ~1 log, but
had no effect on CD25− cells (Fig. 3c). In contrast, H9 was far less sensitive to the F42A
mutation, with the dose-response curves of H9 versus H9 F42A being very similar on both
CD25+ and CD25− cells (Fig. 3d).
Activity of super-2 on T cells

Author Manuscript

We assessed the activity of several super-2s on T cells that were either deficient in, or
expressed CD25. For the former experiment, CD4+ T cells were isolated from CD25knockout mice, followed by stimulation by either WT IL-2 or six super-2s and assaying for
STAT5 phosphorylation at a range of cytokine concentrations (Fig 3e, Supplementary Fig.
11). CD25−/− CD4+ T cells responded poorly to exogenous WT IL-2 stimulation, but
super-2s induced STAT5 phosphorylation in these cells proportional to their affinity for
IL-2Rβ.
The principle functional effect of IL-2 is to promote T cell proliferation, particularly for
naïve T cells. Human naïve CD4+ T cells were isolated and left either unstimulated or
stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody with or without the different IL-2 variants

(Fig 3f, Supplementary Fig. 12). Increased proliferation effects on naïve human T cells
correlated with increased affinity for IL-2Rβ and STAT5 phosphorylation shown earlier, as
the rank order of potency was D10 = H9 > 6-6 > WT IL-2 (see Supplementary Fig. 12 for
the complete titration).
We next tested the IL-2 variants for their ability to induce STAT5 phosphorylation on
experienced human CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 13), which highly express the
trimeric IL-2Rαβγ complex. Human CD4+ T cells were in vitro activated by T cell receptor
(TCR) stimulation and rested to generate “experienced” human CD4+ CD25+ T cells. As for
the CD25+ YT-1 cells, we observed a much smaller difference between IL-2 and the
super-2s.
In vivo properties of super-2

Author Manuscript

We assessed the potency of the super-2 H9 on expansion of CD25low versus CD25high T
cells, in comparison to WT IL-2 and IL-2/anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) complexes,
which have been shown to exert reduced pulmonary edema yet very potent anti-tumor
responses in vivo14–16. On antigen-experienced (memory-phenotype, MP) CD8+ T cells,
expressing only low levels of CD25 but high levels of IL-2Rβγ, H9 induced more than three
times the rate of proliferation and expansion as WT IL-2 (Fig 4a, Supplementary Fig. 14a).
However, on CD4+ CD25high T regulatory (Treg) cells, we found that the CD25-competent
WT IL-2 and H9 achieved comparable maximal expansion, demonstrating again that
expression of CD25 mitigates the difference between super-2 and WT IL-2 (Fig. 4a, S14b).
Thus, the H9 exhibits the desired property that it shows enhanced stimulation towards CD8+
T cells, but not towards Treg cells compared to WT IL-2.

Author Manuscript

As previously reported, administration of high-dose WT IL-2 for five days induced
substantial pulmonary edema, which is known to be CD25-dependent15 (Fig. 4b). Although
significantly more stimulatory for cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4a), H9 super-2 caused
substantially less pulmonary edema (Fig. 4b).

Author Manuscript

Given the more favorable properties of H9 in comparison to IL-2, we assessed its ability to
stimulate effector functions of cytotoxic T cells in four different tumor models in vivo,
where high-dose IL-2 administration has been previously shown to result in tumor
regression15,17. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with B16F10
melanoma cells, followed by administration of either high-dose IL-2, IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb
complexes, or H9 super-2, once tumor nodules became visible and palpable. PBS-treated
control mice rapidly developed large subcutaneous tumors reaching a volume of about 1500
mm3 on day 18 (Fig. 4c). As previously shown, high-dose IL-2 treatment was able to delay
tumor growth by as much as 39% on day 18 (p<0.05), while IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes
exerted very effective tumor control, reducing tumor growth by >80% on day 18 (p<0.005)
(Fig. 4c). Significantly, similar to IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes, mice receiving high-dose
H9 showed a dramatic decrease of tumor load on day 18, which was reduced by >80%
compared to PBS (p<0.005) and by >70% compared to WT IL-2 (p<0.005) (Fig. 4c).
Similar results were obtained using three other tumor models, including murine colon
carcinoma and Lewis lung carcinoma injected subcutaneously (Fig. 4d,e) and B16F10 cells
administered intravenously (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 15). Collectively, these data show

that the H9 super-2 is very effective against different tumors, albeit inducing reduced
pulmonary edema.
The practical implications are that this conformational nuance in IL-2 can be exploited for
therapy. Super-2 robustly activates cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells for potent antitumor immune responses, yet it elicits minimal toxicity, suggesting that super-2 could
warrant reconsideration for clinical applications of IL-2.

Methods Summary
Yeast display and selection of IL-2

Author Manuscript

Error-prone and site-directed libraries of IL-2 were displayed on yeast as previously
described18 and stained with biotinylated IL-2Rβ at successively decreasing concentrations.
Staining was detected with streptavidin-PE and yeast were separated using paramagnetic
anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi; MACS). Enrichment of positively-staining yeast was
monitored by flow-cytometry.
Protein expression, purification, and structural determination
Human IL-2 variants and the ectodomains of IL-2Rβ, γc, and CD25 were expressed in Hi5
cells and purified as previously described11. Proteins were concentrated to 8–20 mg/mL and
crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops. Diffraction studies were performed at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory and the Advanced Light Source. Crystal
structures were solved by molecular replacement with PHASER19 and refined using
PHENIX20 and COOT21.

Mice
C57BL/6 and Thy1.1-congenic mice on a C57BL/6 background were maintained under
specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 3–6 months of age. Experiments were
performed in accordance with the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office guidelines and approved
by the Cantonal Veterinary Office.
In vivo T cell proliferation
2–3×106 CFSE-labeled CD44high CD8+ T cells from Thy1.1-congenic mice were injected
intravenously to Thy1.2-congenic animals. Mice received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections of PBS, 20 μg IL-2, 1.5 μg IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes, or 20 μg H9 for 5
days. On the sixth day, spleens were removed and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Toxicity
Pulmonary edema was determined by measurement of pulmonary wet weight on the sixth
day after five daily i.p. injections of PBS, 20 μg IL-2, 1.5 μg IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes,
or 20 μg H9 as previously described15.

Figure 2. Basis of affinity enhancement for IL-2Rβ from structural and molecular dynamics
characterization of D10 super-2

a, Crystal structure of the D10 super-2 at 3.1 Å with mutated residues in red (see also
Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7a). b, D10 in complex with human IL-2Rβ
and γc preserves the WT receptor dimer geometry (see also Supplementary Fig. 7b). c, The
unliganded D10 super-2 helix C (brown), moves towards its hydrophobic core compared to
unliganded WT IL-2 (green, PDBID 3INK). This helix C position is more similar to that of
helix C in IL-2 bound to IL-2Rα (purple, PDBID 1Z92) (see also Supplementary Fig. 8). d,
A 40ns MD simulation shows a reduction of the average RMSD for the B and C helices, and
the B-C loop in D10 versus IL-2 (see also Supplementary Fig. 8c). Error bars represent the
standard error of the RMSD. e, Helix C in IL-2 (green, left panel) drifts during the MD
simulation more than super-2 D10 (brown, right panel) when compared to IL-2 bound to
IL-2Rα (purple).

Dose-response curves of STAT5 phosphorylation on (a) CD25− and (b) CD25+ YT-1 cells
with WT IL-2 and three super-2s. c, Dose-response curves of STAT5 phosphorylation on
CD25+ (solid curve) and CD25−(dashed curve) YT-1 cells with WT IL-2 (pink curves) and
IL-2-F42A mutation (purple curves). d, Dose-response curves of STAT5 phosphorylation on
CD25+ (solid curve) and CD25−(dashed curve) YT-1 cells with H9 (green curves) and H9F42A mutation (purple curves). e, Super-2s have superior potency over IL-2 on T cells
derived from CD25−/− mice as demonstrated by dose-response curves for STAT5
phosphorylation on T cells demonstrating that potency correlates with IL-2Rβ affinity (see
also Supplementary Fig. 10). f, Proliferation of human naïve CD4+ T cell (CD25low) reveals
similar potency profiles as seen with CD25−/− T cells. Proliferation was measured by CFSE
dilution on day 5 (see also Supplementary Fig. 10). Error bars in a–d represent SEM of
mean fluorescence units for each sample at the indicated cytokine concentration.

Figure 4. Functional and anti-tumor activities of super-2 in vivo

Author Manuscript

a, Total cell counts of host CD3+ CD8+ CD44high memory-phenotype T cells (MP CD8+,
closed bars), and host CD3+ CD4+ CD25high T cells (Treg, open bars) was determined in the
spleens of mice receiving either PBS, 20 μg IL-2, 1.5 μg IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes
(IL-2/mAb), or 20 μg H9 (see also Supplementary Fig. 14). b, Pulmonary edema (pulmonary
wet weight) served to assess adverse toxic effects following IL-2 treatment, and was
determined by weighing lungs before and after drying. c–f, C57BL/6 mice (n=3–4 mice/
group) were injected either subcutaneously with 106 B16F10 melanoma cells (B16, c), 2.5×
106 murine colon carcinoma 38 (MC38, d), 106 Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC, e), or mice
received 3× 105 B16F10 melanoma cells intravenously (B16, f), followed by daily injections
of either PBS, 20 μg IL-2, 1.5 μg IL-2/mAb complexes, or 20 μg H9 for five days once
subcutaneous tumor nodules became visible and palpable or from day three on for
intravenously-injected tumors (see also Supplementary Fig. 15). Shown is mean tumor
volume in mm3 (+/− SD) vs. time upon tumor inoculation. Error bars represent SEM. P
values refer to comparisons of WT with the other treatment modalities. *, p<0.05; **,
p<0.01; ***, p<0.001.
