Abstract
Aberrant signaling of the nuclear facotr (NF-KB) pathway has
been identified as a mediator of survival and apoptosis
resistance in leukemias and lymphomas. Here, we report that
cell death of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines induced by
inhibition of the NF-KB pathway is independent of caspases or
classic death receptors. We found that free intracellular iron
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main mediators of
this cell death. Antioxidants such as N-Acetyl-L-cysteine and
glutathione or the iron chelator desferrioxamine effectively
block cell death in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines or
primary T cells from Sézary patients. We show that inhibition
of constitutively active NF-KB causes down-regulation of
ferritin heavy chain (FHC) that leads to an increase of free
intracellular iron, which, in turn, induces massive generation
of ROS. Furthermore, direct down-regulation of FHC by siRNA
caused a ROS-dependent cell death. Finally, high concentrations of ROS induce cell death of malignant T cells. In
contrast, T cells isolated from healthy donors do not display
down-regulation of FHC and, therefore, do not show an
increase in iron and cell death upon NF-KB inhibition. In
addition, in a murine T-cell lymphoma model, we show that
inhibition of NF-KB and subsequent down-regulation of FHC
significantly delays tumor growth in vivo. Thus, our results
promote FHC as a potential target for effective therapy in
lymphomas with aberrant NF-KB signaling. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Constitutive activation of nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) is
considered to be crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and
apoptosis resistance in many cancers and especially in lymphomas
(1–3). In malignant cells isolated from patients with multiple
myeloma (4, 5), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (6), acute
myelogenous leukemia (7), acute lymphocyte leukemia (8), chronic
myelogenous leukemia (9), myelodysplastic syndrome (10, 11),
and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; refs. 12, 13) constitutive
NF-nB activation has been described. Sézary syndrome is the
leukemic variant of CTCL, characterized by erythroderma, general

lymphadenopathy, and Sézary cells circulating in the peripheral
blood (14). It usually takes an aggressive course with a median
survival time of 2 to 4 years (15). Sézary cells are malignant
pleomorphic CD4+ T cells, which show constitutive activation of
NF-nB. Inhibition of NF-nB by IkBa overexpression results in
apoptosis in these cells (12). The protective role of NF-nB in cancer
cells is partially mediated by the up-regulation of antiapoptotic
genes including Bcl-2 family members (1, 16). However, the
involvement of these proteins in induction of apoptosis by
inhibition of NF-nB was not observed. Furthermore, autophagy
or release of apoptosis-inducing factor were not found to be
essential for this cell death (11). Recent studies indicate that
stimulation of the NF-nB pathway by tumor necrosis factor a
(TNFa) activates the antioxidative defense by up-regulation of
MnSOD or ferritin heavy chain (FHC; refs. 17, 18). However,
whether the antioxidative defense is regulated by constitutively
activated NF-nB and whether this regulation is important for cell
death and survival of cancer cells is unknown.
One of the enzymes reported to be regulated by NF-nB is FHC.
Ferritin is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed iron
storage protein that consists of two subunits, the FHC and the
ferritin light chain (19). Twenty-four of these subunits assemble
to store up to 4,500 iron atoms (19). FHC possesses a ferroxidase
activity, which converts toxic Fe2+ into nontoxic Fe3+, whereas
ferritin light chain plays a role in iron nucleation and protein
stability. Iron can participate in the Fenton reaction generating
hydroxide anions and hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide
(Fe2+ + H2O2 ! Fe3+ + OH + OH; ref. 19). Hydroxyl radicals are
highly reactive molecules. They can oxidize proteins and lipids
thereby generating new reactive species that induce damage to
other biomolecules in a chain reaction such as fashion (20).
Therefore, the proper sequestration of intracellular iron is highly
critical to avoid generation of oxidative stress, and thus,
homozygous deletion of FHC in mice is lethal (21). However, a
small amount of free cytosolic iron—the so-called labile iron pool
(LIP)—is tolerated by the cell. Thus, the uptake and sequestration
of iron is tightly regulated by iron regulatory proteins, which bind
to iron responsive elements of ferritin mRNA at the 5¶ untranslated
region (5¶UTR) and block translation (22). In the presence of high
cellular concentrations of iron, the iron responsive element binding
activity of iron regulatory protein is diminished and translation is
derepressed (22). Consequently, overexpression of FHC results in
down-regulation of LIP (23, 24) and lower levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS; refs. 24, 25).
Here, we report that inhibition of the NF-nB pathway by specific
inhibitors cause an iron- and ROS-dependent, but caspase- and
cathepsin-independent, cell death of CTCL cell lines and of primary

cells from patients with Sézary syndrome. We show that inhibition
of the NF-nB signaling pathway results in induction of massive
oxidative stress and cell death, which can be blocked by
antioxidants such as N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione
mono-ethyl-ester (GSH) or the iron chelator desferrioxamine
(DFO). Furthermore, inhibition of the NF-nB pathway induces an
increase of free intracellular iron in CTCL cell lines and in T cells
from Sézary patients but not in T cells from normal healthy donors.
We show that inhibition of constitutively active NF-nB results in
down-regulation of FHC in T cells from Sézary patients but not in
T cells from healthy donors. Direct down-regulation of FHC by
siRNA causes a ROS-dependent cell death. Finally, using a murine
T-cell lymphoma model, we show that NF-nB inhibition significantly delays tumor growth in vivo by down-regulation of FHC.
Thus, manipulation of the intracellular iron balance by targeting
iron storage proteins could have a therapeutic effect on the
treatment of cancer.

Mice, tumor cell line, and tumor cell injection. C57BL/6 wild-type
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were housed under
specific pathogen-free conditions and used in experiments at ages 6 to 8 wk.
All experiments were performed according to local animal experimental
ethics committee guidelines. For the analysis of tumor growth in vivo,
groups of 14 mice were injected s.c. in the left flank with 1  106 RMA-S

Erythrocytes were lysed by using buffered ammonium chloride solution.
Blood counts were performed by the clinical laboratories of the University
of Heidelberg, Germany.
ROS generation assays. ROS levels were assayed as described recently
(26, 27). Briefly, cells were stained with the oxidation-sensitive dye
H2DCFDA (5 Amol/L) for 30 min. Then, cells were treated with NF-nB
inhibitor or NBD for 2 h. Treatment was terminated by ice-cold PBS and
ROS generation was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). The increase in fluorescence of treated versus untreated samples is
shown. In the case of FHC down-regulation by siRNA or preincubation with
the iron chelator DFO and DP, cells were first treated with siRNA, DFO, or
DP for 6 h and then stained with 5 Amol/L H2DCFDA for 30 min. ROS
generation was determined by FACS and quantified as the increase in mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI), calculated by the following formula: increase
in MFI (%) = [(MFIstimulated  MFIunstimulated)/MFIunstimulated]  100 (26).
LIP assays. Cells were incubated with 0.01 Amol/L calcein-AM for 5 min
at 37jC in medium. Then, cells were left mock treated or treated with
20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor, 40 Amol/L NBD, or 0.1 Ag/mL Fe (II) for 2 h.
Next, each cell sample was divided into two individual samples. One sample
was either left untreated as control, the other was incubated with 100 Amol/
L DP for 2 h, washed with cold PBS, and fluorescence of calcein was
measured at 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. Fe (II) and Fe (III)
quench the fluorescence of calcein, which allows an estimation of LIP in
cells. Addition of strong Fe (II) chelators such as DP competes for Fe (II)
binding with calcein and fluorescence of calcein increases. The increase in
fluorescence provides a value to estimate the previous concentration of
calcein-bound iron, which corresponds to the actual LIP (23, 28). The
increase in fluorescence of mock-treated cells was set to 100% and
compared with the increase in fluorescence of cells treated with 20 Amol/L
NF-nB inhibitor, 40 Amol/L NBD, or 0.1 Ag/mL Fe (II). LIP was determined
by FACS and quantified as the increase in MFI between samples not treated
with DP and samples treated with DP. Increase in MFI of mock-treated cells
was set to 100% and compared with the increase of MFI of NF-nB inhibitor,
NBD, or Fe (II)–treated cells.
Cell death assays. For cell death induction, MyLa cells or peripheral
T cells were stimulated with indicated concentrations of inhibitors. Cell
death was assessed by forward-to-side-scatter profile (29) or by AnnexinV–
FITC (Immunotools) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Specific cell
death was calculated by the following equation: specific cell death % =
(% experimental cell death  % spontaneous cell death)/(100%  %
spontaneous cell death)  100 (26, 27).

Results
NF-KB inhibition induces ROS-dependent cell death in
T cells from Sézary patients. We investigated the role of
constitutive NF-nB activation for cell survival in Sézary syndrome.
Primary T cells isolated from 12 patients suffering from Sézary
syndrome were incubated with a chemical NF-nB inhibitor (30) or
the NBD (31). Both inhibitors show equal efficiency to block NF-nB
activation (Supplementary Fig. S1A). NF-nB inhibition led to a
significant induction of cell death in T cells from all patients
investigated but not of 12 healthy donors (Fig. 1A). This shows that
malignant T cells are more sensitive toward inhibition of NF-nB
than T cells from normal healthy donors. Treatment of T cells from
Sézary patients with another NF-nB inhibitor, NBD, induced cell
death compared with its inactive version cell permeable mutant
NBD (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Sézary cells are characterized by the expression of monoclonal
Vh chain of the T-cell receptor, which is specific for the individual
patients (32). To check whether Sézary cells are more sensitive to
inhibition of NF-nB than normal cells in the same patient, we
isolated Vh+ and Vh T cells of three patients. Indeed, cell death
induced by the NF-nB inhibitor of the malignant Vh2+ population
is stronger than in the nonmalignant Vh2 population (Fig. 1B). To

NF-kB in ROS- and Iron-Dependent Cell Death

Figure 1. Survival of primary cells from Sézary patients and the CTCL cell lines MyLa, Hut78, and SeAx depend on constitutive NF-nB activation. A, purified peripheral
T cells of 12 healthy donors and 12 patients with Sézary syndrome were treated with 1% DMSO or 5 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 72 h. Cell death was assessed by
flow cytometry. Cell death was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Student’s t test, P < 0.001 (***). B, malignant T cells of patient 1 were stained
with a monoclonal antibody directed against the clonal region of Vh2+ T-cell receptor and sorted by flow cytometry (top right and bottom ). Cells were treated with
5 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor and cell death of Vh2+ and Vh2 was assessed by flow cytometry (left ). C, the CTCL cell lines MyLa, Hut78, and SeAx were treated with
20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor and cotreated with 1% DMSO, 1% NOK 1, 20 Amol/L zVAD, 25 Amol/L Enbrel, 50 Amol/L zFA, 50 Amol/L zFA and 20 Amol/L zVAD, 20 mmol/L
NAC, 0.5 mmol/L GSH, or 20 Amol/L DFO for 24 and 48 h. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. D, purified peripheral T cells of a Sézary patient were
treated with 5 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor and cotreated with NAC, GSH, or DFO for 24 h. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. The experiment shown is
representative for three independent patients analyzed. Student’s t test, P < 0.05 (*); P < 0.01 (**). Ctr, control.

investigate the molecular mechanism of cell death induction by
inhibition of NF-nB, we used the CTCL cell lines MyLa, Hut78, and
SeAx, which can be sensitized toward cell death by NF-nB inhibitor
comparable with primary Sézary cells (Fig. 1C). Cotreatment with
a neutralizing anti-CD95 ligand (CD95L) antibody (NOK1), a
pancaspase inhibitor (zVAD), a soluble TNF-Receptor-Fc (Enbrel),
and a cathepsin inhibitor (zFA) did not block cell death induced by
NF-nB inhibition (Fig. 1C). This shows that the cell death observed
here is caspase independent and differs from classic cell death
pathways. Remarkably, antioxidants including NAC, cell permeable
GSH, or the iron chelator DFO could diminish cell death induced
by the NF-nB inhibitor (Fig. 1C) or the NBD (Supplementary
Fig. S1C and D). This implies that the generation of ROS and the
release of iron are involved in cell death induced by NF-nB
inhibition. A similar outcome was obtained for primary T cells from
Sézary patients incubated with the NF-nB inhibitor (Fig. 1D). The
addition of NAC, GSH, or DFO prevented cell death, whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

addition of NOK1 or zVAD did not interfere with cell death
induction by NF-nB inhibitor (Fig. 1D). Thus, generation of ROS
and the release of iron are involved in cell death by NF-nB
inhibition of malignant T cells from Sézary patients.
Inhibition of the NF-KB signaling pathway results in ROS
generation and an increase of iron. Because cell death induced
by NF-nB inhibition was dependent on ROS, we next sought to
determine whether NF-nB inhibition generates ROS in CTCL cell
lines. Cells were incubated with the oxidation sensitive dye
H2DCFDA (26, 27) and incubated with the NF-nB inhibitor or with
NBD for 2 h. Inhibition of NF-nB activation by NF-nB inhibitor
generated a strong oxidative stress without any costimulation that
could be blocked by addition of NAC or GSH (Fig. 2A). Similar
results were obtained for NBD (Supplementary Fig. S2A). This
indicates that constitutively active NF-nB regulates the expression
of proteins or enzymes with antioxidative capacity and prevents
accumulation of toxic ROS (17, 18). To analyze whether an increase

of intracellular iron is responsible for induction of oxidative stress,
MyLa, Hut78, and SeAx cells were preincubated with the iron
chelator DFO before application of the NF-nB inhibitor. We
detected that the iron chelator DFO blocked ROS generation in all
three cell lines (Fig. 2B), suggesting an involvement of Fenton
chemistry for which H2O2 is required. To specify ROS, which is
generated by inhibition of NF-nB, we overexpressed Catalase and
CuZnSOD, which selectively degrade H2O2 and superoxide anion
(O
2 ), respectively. Overexpression of Catalase and CuZnSOD was
confirmed by Western Blot (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Catalase but
not CuZnSOD blocked ROS generated by inhibition of NF-nB
showing that H2O2 is important for the induction of ROS (Fig. 2C)

as required for the Fenton reaction. The glutathione peroxidase
mimetic ebselen or the hydroxyl radical scavenger butylated
hydroxyl-anisole equally blocked ROS generation, whereas the
SOD mimetic Manganese (III) tetrakis 4-benzoic acid porphyrin
had no effect on ROS generation (data not shown). To further
evaluate the involvement of iron homeostasis in cell death induced
by inhibition of NF-nB, we investigated the level of free intracellular
iron, the so-called LIP, upon NF-nB inhibitor treatment. In
comparison to untreated control cells, MyLa, Hut78, and SeAx
cells treated with the NF-nB inhibitor showed an increase of LIP of
f60% to 70% (Fig. 2D). As an internal control, 0.1 Ag/mL of Fe2+
was added to MyLa cells, which caused a similar increase of LIP

Figure 2. NF-nB inhibitor induces ROS
and release of iron in CTCL cell lines.
A , MyLa cells were preincubated with
H2DCFDA for 30 min, next preincubated
with the indicated concentrations of NAC
(left ) or GSH (right ) for 30 min. Then,
cells were treated with 20 Amol/L NF-nB
inhibitor for 2 h and fluorescence was
detected by flow cytometry. B, CTCL
cell lines MyLa, Hut78, and SeAx were
preincubated with 20 Amol/L DFO for 6 h.
Then 5 Amol/L H2DCFDA were added for
30 min. Next, samples were treated with
20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 2 h and
fluorescence was detected by flow
cytometry at fluorescence of 518 nm.
C, Myla cells were transiently transfected
with control vector, a vector encoding
catalase, and a vector encoding
CuZnSOD. Then, cells were stained
with H2DCFDA for 30 min and treated
with 20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 2 h.
Fluorescence was detected by flow
cytometry. The increase in MFI was
normalized to untreated samples.
D, MyLa, Hut78, SeAx cell lines, purified
T cells from three Sézary Patients, and
purified T cells from three healthy donors
were investigated for release of iron after
treatment with NF-nB inhibitor. Cells were
incubated with 0.01 Amol/L calcein-AM for
30 min, either left untreated or stimulated
with NF-nB inhibitor for 2 h or with
0.1 Ag/mL of Fe2+. Then, all samples
were treated with 100 Amol/L DP for 1 h.
Fluorescence of calcein was measured.
The increase in MFI was calculated as
described in Materials and Methods and
is related to free intracellular iron.
Untreated cells were normalized to 100%.

NF-kB in ROS- and Iron-Dependent Cell Death

Figure 3. NF-nB inhibitor induces down-regulation of FHC in CTCL cell lines and T cells isolated from Sézary patients. A and B, expression of genes involved in
oxidative stress and antioxidative defense were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (RT2 Profiler PCR Array system). MyLa cells were either left untreated or treated with
20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 4 h. Relative changes of selected genes of untreated to NF-nB inhibitor–treated cells are shown. C, CTCL cell lines MyLa, Hut78,
and SeAx were treated with 20 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 4 h and expression of FHC was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. D, the relative expression levels of FHC in
untreated T cells from four Sézary patients and T cells from five healthy donors of comparable age were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (left ). Then, T cells of
these donors were incubated with 5 Amol/L NF-nB inhibitor for 4 h and the expression level of FHC was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (right ). Expression levels
of NF-nB inhibitor–treated samples were normalized to untreated samples. Student’s t test, P < 0.01 (**).

(Fig. 2C). Remarkably, Sézary cells from three patients showed a
similar increase of LIP to CTCL cell lines, whereas healthy donors
did not show a significant increase (Fig. 2C). This reflects that
inhibition of NF-nB has a severer effect on Sézary cells in which
NF-nB is constitutively activated than on cells of normal healthy
donors without constitutive activation of NF-nB. In conclusion,
inhibition of NF-nB results in an increase of intracellular iron in
cells with otherwise constitutive activation of NF-nB that leads to
strong generation of ROS.
Inhibition of the NF-KB signaling pathway results in downregulation of FHC. The NF-nB pathway has been reported to
regulate the expression of proteins or enzymes with antioxidative
capacities that prevent accumulation of toxic ROS (17, 18).
Therefore, we decided to analyze 84 genes that were previously
described to be involved in the antioxidative defense by
quantitative RT-PCR upon NF-nB inhibition (33, 34). The
antioxidative defense is a complex network controlled by many
different means. We observed up-regulation of antioxidative

www.aacrjournals.org

enzymes such as glutathione reductase or glutathione transferase
~ 1, indicating that cells respond to the disturbance of the redox
equilibrium via up-regulation of antioxidative enzymes, which are
most probably not under control of NF-nB (Fig. 3A and B). This
up-regulation seems to be inefficient or too late to protect cells
because the net result is an increase in ROS and cell death (Figs. 1
and 2). In addition, we found several antioxidative genes, including
the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase and glutathione
synthetase, which were down-regulated upon incubation of MyLa
cells with the NF-nB inhibitor (Fig. 3A and B). However,
the strongest decrease in mRNA expression (27-fold) was
observed for FHC (Fig. 3A and B). FHC has been described as
target for NF-nB upon TNFa stimulation in fibroblasts (18).
However, here, we found that FHC is a target for constitutive NF-nB
signaling in malignant lymphomas without additional stimuli.
Furthermore, we treated Hut78 and SeAx cells with the NF-nB
inhibitor and observed a down-regulation of FHC in these cell lines
(Fig. 3C). Therefore, these results suggest a crucial role for FHC

in cell death induced by NF-nB inhibition. To check whether
constitutively activated NF-nB regulates FHC in malignant cells,
T cells from patients suffering from Sézary syndrome were
treated with the NF-nB inhibitor. Interestingly, a significant
down-regulation of FHC mRNA levels in T cells from Sézary
patients was observed, whereas FHC mRNA was not downregulated in T cells from healthy donors (Fig. 3D, right). The relative
expression levels of FHC were found to be higher in T cells from
Sézary patients than in T cells from healthy donors (Fig. 3D, left).
Thus, this shows that constitutively active NF-nB regulates FHC
expression in malignant T cells from Sézary patients.
Down-regulation of FHC by siRNA induces cell death. To test
whether FHC down-regulation and consecutive ROS induction is
the mechanism responsible for cell death induction by NF-nB
inhibition, we directly down-regulated FHC expression in MyLa
cells by specific siRNAs. siRNA-mediated knockdown of FHC by
four different siRNAs decreased expression of FHC mRNA up to
70% (Fig. 4A). Down-regulation of FHC expression by these siRNAs
resulted in induction of cell death (Fig. 4B), whereas viability of
nonsense siRNA treated cells was >80% (data not shown). Cell
death was not induced by nonsense siRNA and one siRNA targeted
against MAP kinase kinase 4, a protein not involved in NF-nB
signaling. To further ensure that cell death is mediated by downregulation of FHC, we down-regulated endogenous FHC by an
siRNA targeting the 3¶UTR of FHC and rescued cell viability by
transient overexpression of FHC, which is not affected by siRNA
treatment (Fig. 4C). Therefore, exogenous FHC restored cell
viability showing that cell death was specifically caused by downregulation of FHC. Furthermore, we investigated whether down-

regulation of FHC is lethal for malignant Vh+ T cells from patients.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of FHC by siRNAs decreased expression of FHC mRNA up to 50% in primary cells from Sézary patients
(Fig. 4D, insert). Indeed, down-regulation of FHC expression
induced up to 20% cell death of Vh+ T cells isolated from Sézary
patients (Fig. 4D), whereas viability of cells treated with nonsense
siRNA was >85% (data not shown). These results show that downregulation of FHC is lethal for cell lines and primary tumor cells.
Down-regulation of FHC by siRNA leads to generation of
oxidative stress. Because ROS seems to be a major mediator of
cell death induced by NF-nB inhibitors, we analyzed whether
down-regulation of FHC expression by siRNA also results in ROS
generation. Reduced expression of FHC led to increased ROS
production compared with treatment with nonsense or MAP
kinase kinase 4 siRNA (Fig. 5A). The increase of ROS observed was
comparable with ROS generation induced by application of the
NF-nB inhibitor (Fig. 2A). In addition, induction of ROS upon
down-regulation of FHC expression by siRNA was observed in
malignant T cells from Sézary patients (Fig. 5B). Furthermore,
we found that cell death induced by down-regulation of FHC
expression was dependent on ROS because the antioxidants NAC
and GSH could efficiently inhibit cell death (Fig. 5C). These
findings show that down-regulation of FHC expression causes
generation of ROS and, subsequently, cell death. To further
delineate the role of FHC, we decided to transiently overexpress
FHC in MyLa cells and to analyze cell death. As expected, cells
overexpressing FHC showed decreased sensitivity toward the
NF-nB inhibitor or NBD (Fig. 5D). This shows that toxicity of
NF-nB inhibitors are mediated by down-regulation of FHC. Thus,

regulation of FHC expression by constitutively active NF-nB
pathway is important for the survival of CTCL cells.
Inhibition of NF-KB delays tumor growth in vivo by downregulation of FHC expression. To investigate whether manipulation of the intracellular free iron level can induce cell death in
other T-cell tumors, we sought to analyze the effects of NF-nB
inhibition in the T cell lymphoma RMA-S. RMA-S is a murine
lymphoma cell line derived from the Rauscher MuLV-induced RBL5 cell line (35). Inhibition of NF-nB induced a increase of LIP and
ROS in RMA-S cells in vitro as observed for MyLa, Hut78, SeAx cells,
or malignant T cells from Sézary patients (Supplementary Fig. S3A;
Fig. 6A). Furthermore, FHC down-regulation via siRNA induced a
ROS-dependent cell death that could be blocked by antioxidants
(Fig. 6B). This shows that RMA-S cells react to inhibition of NF-nB
in a similar way as MyLa, Hut78, SeAx cells, or primary patient
cells. To analyze whether NF-nB activity and expression of FHC are
required for tumor growth in vivo, 1  106 RMA-S cells were
injected s.c. into C57BL/6 mice. In toxicity studies, 396 Ag/kg of
NF-nB inhibitor was found to be sublethal for C57BL/6 mice (data
not shown). Therefore, mice were either mock treated or treated
daily with 396 Ag/kg NF-nB inhibitor beginning on day 6 after
tumor cell injection. We observed that tumors of mice treated with
NF-nB inhibitor grew at a significantly slower rate than in mocktreated mice (Fig. 6C). Mice were sacrificed and tumors were
isolated on day 17. Tumors of mice treated with NF-nB inhibitor
showed a significantly lower expression of FHC compared with
mock-treated mice (Fig. 6D). Thus, FHC expression influences
tumor growth in vivo. To estimate the general toxicity of in vivo
application of the NF-nB inhibitor, animal weight was measured
and no particular differences during treatment were observed
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Furthermore, the complete blood count

www.aacrjournals.org

of three mice of each treatment group showed comparable values for
leukocytes, erythrocytes, haemoglobin, and thrombocytes (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together, these experiments confirm the
effect of FHC expression on tumor growth in vivo. NF-nB inhibition
induces a down-modulation of FHC expression, which finally
decreases tumor growth. Thus, interference with FHC expression
levels seems to be a promising tool for treatment of lymphomas.

Discussion
The present study shows that inhibition of the NF-nB pathway in
lymphomas with constitutively activated NF-nB causes cell death,
which is dependent on ROS and iron. Furthermore, the study
defines FHC as an important target of constitutively active NF-nB
in malignant T cells from patients with Sézary syndrome that is
required for regulation of iron and ROS levels in cells.
FHC has been described as a target gene for NF-nB signaling
induced by TNFa or Ras transformation (18, 36). However, here, we
found that the FHC expression level is controlled by constitutively
active NF-nB in malignant T cells without further stimuli.
Remarkably, inhibition of NF-nB led to down-regulation of FHC
in T cells from Sézary patients but not in T cells from normal
healthy donors. In addition, an increase of the intracellular iron LIP
was also exclusively observed for CTCL cell lines or T cells from
Sézary patients but not in normal T cells. Finally, inhibition of
NF-nB induced cell death in malignant T cells isolated from Sézary
patients and CTCL cell lines but not in normal T cells. In
conclusion, all events that are involved in cell death were only seen
in malignant cells. Recent studies showed that constitutive
activation of NF-nB is found in Sézary cells but not in T cells
from normal healthy donors (12, 37). This might explain why

inhibition of NF-nB is more toxic to Sézary cells but not to normal
T cells and might render NF-nB or FHC promising drug candidates
without severe side effects.
Inhibition of the NF-nB pathway results in an increase of iron,
which in consequence catalyzes a massive generation of ROS via
the Fenton reaction. Cell death caused by this strong oxidative
stress can be blocked by FHC overexpression and iron chelators
such as DFO. This shows that FHC acts protective and
antiapoptotic in cancers with constitutive NF-nB signaling. An
increase of ROS was also observed when FHC was targeted directly
by siRNA, which induced cell death of MyLa cells and malignant
T cells from patients with Sézary syndrome. Down-regulation of
FHC causes an increase in free intracellular iron. Free iron
participates in the Fenton reaction generating hydroxyl radicals
and hydroxide anions from hydrogen peroxide (19). Hydroxyl
radicals are highly reactive and react with a variety of biological
molecules including DNA, RNA, cholesterol, lipids, carbohydrates,
and proteins. The extent of damage to particular targets depends
on a number of factors including the concentration of the target,
the rate constant for the reaction of the oxidant with the target,
the location of the target when compared with the side of radical
formation, the occurrence of secondary damaging events (chain
reactions and damage transfer processes), the occurrence of
oxidant-scavenging reactions, and repair reactions. Hydroxyl
radicals can react with the backbone of proteins and amino acid
side chains resulting in the formation of further damaging reactive
species. These reactive species can induce damage to other
biomolecules including lipids and other proteins in a chain reaction
like manner (20). Low amounts of ROS, especially less reactive and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

more selective molecules such as H2O2, can act as second
messengers for proper development, proliferation, and apoptosis
regulation (26, 27, 38). High amounts of ROS, especially highly
reactive and less specific molecules such as hydrogen peroxide, lead
to induction of oxidative stress, cell death, and aging (34). Here, we
show that an increase of free iron led to generation of massive
oxidative stress and cell death in CTCL cell lines and T cells from
Sézary patients. It is known that massive cellular oxidation by strong
generation of ROS may lead to necrotic cell death instead of
apoptosis (39). This is supported by our observation that inhibitors
of classic cell death pathways or caspase inhibitor zVAD were not
effective at suppressing cell death. Thus, investigated cell death is
different from classic apoptosis and rather might be necrotic.
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is widely used as NF-nB
inhibitor because it blocks degradation of IkBa. However, we
observed that bortezomib induced only a mild oxidative stress,
which was independent of iron (data not shown). This suggests
that FHC is not down-regulated by bortezomib, likely because
bortezomib blocks degradation of FHC by the proteasome and
thus, interferes with FHC degradation. In conclusion, bortezomib
does not cover all events of NF-nB inhibition and development of
other NF-nB inhibitors or molecules targeting FHC are required.
FHC might be targeted in several ways. First, FHC shows
enzymatic activity required for the storage of iron (III), the
nontoxic form of iron for cells. Blocking this enzymatic activity by
small-molecule inhibitors would abolish the capability for tumor
cells to store iron in a secure way. Another option for FHC
down-regulation comprises delivery of specific siRNA or miRNA
into tumor cells. Decreased expression of FHC is of disadvantage

NF-kB in ROS- and Iron-Dependent Cell Death

for growing cells and clearly blocked cell proliferation as evidenced
by our in vivo model. Last, the uptake of iron into cells can be
disrupted by antibodies specific for the transferrin receptor (CD71).
Assuming that fast growing cells require enhanced iron uptake,
antibodies blocking CD71 and thus interfering with iron uptake
will delay cell proliferation.
Interference with FHC expression or down-regulation of FHC
may occur at different kinetics. Fast down-regulation of FHC
results in an immediate increase of free intracellular iron, which in
turn results in massive generation of ROS and ultimately leads to
cell death. Our data indicate that this oxidative stress might be
more harmful to cancer cells because they generally show higher
basic levels of ROS due to high energy demand and fast
proliferation (40, 41). Slow and mild down-regulation of FHC is
less toxic to cells but will deplete intracellular iron stores, thus
decreasing proliferation rates (42). To investigate whether depletion of intracellular iron stores decreases tumor growth, we
analyzed the effects of NF-nB inhibition in vivo. The murine
T-lymphoma cell line RMA-S reacted absolutely comparable toward
the NF-nB inhibitor as primary T cells from patients, or the three
CTCL cell lines. This suggested the RMA-S model as a suitable
system to investigate the NF-nB inhibitor in vivo. Furthermore,
transplanting SeAx cells in immuno-deficient mice failed, and thus
far, only a mouse model for mycosis fungoides was established (43).
RMA-S cells were injected into C57BL/6 mice and mice were then
treated with the NF-nB inhibitor. Inhibition of NF-nB caused downregulation of FHC and significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo.
This mechanism might be dependent on the tumor type and
especially relevant for T-cell tumors because one previous report
has described that a FHC knockdown had no effect on proliferation
of HeLa cells in vitro (44). However, another report showed that
FHC is involved in proliferation of the breast cell line MCF-7 (45).
It is well-known that proliferating cells are strongly dependent on
continuous iron supply for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis
such as ribonucleotide reductase (46). Because iron is necessary
for cellular proliferation, its depletion leads to cell cylce arrest,
apoptosis, and delayed tumor growth in vivo (47, 48). We assume

that constitutive NF-nB activation is required for fast-growing
tumor cells to provide sufficient iron storage capacity for irondependent enzymes involved in proliferation.
Overexpression of FHC rescued f50% of the cells treated with
NF-nB inhibitor from cell death, suggesting that other targets of
NF-nB may also play a role in this process. Recent data showed that
alterations of Bcl-2 family members may be involved in induction
of cell death. In CTCL cell lines treated with an IKK2 inhibitor, an
up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax dimers and an down-regulation
of survivin was reported (37). Whether alterations in expression are
causative for cell death was not yet investigated (37).
An important message from our study is that regulation of FHC
by constitutively active NF-nB signaling plays a major role for cell
proliferation and apoptosis resistance in hematopoietic malignancies. This observation may also be important for the treatment of
other cancers. Constitutive activation of NF-nB is well-described in
other cancers including breast cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma
(49). Thus, targeting intracellular iron homeostasis with NF-nB
inhibitors or directly by specific inhibitors of proteins involved in
iron metabolism, such as FHC, might be an attractive possibility for
cancer treatment.
