Abstract
The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET pathway supports several hallmark cancer traits, and it is frequently activated in a broad spectrum of human cancers (http://www.vai.org/met/). With the development of
many cancer drugs targeting this pathway, there is a need for relevant in vivo model systems for preclinical
evaluation of drug efficacy. Here, we show that production of the human HGF ligand in transgenic severe
combined immunodeficient mice (hHGFtg-SCID mice) enhances the growth of many MET-expressing human
carcinoma xenografts, including those derived from lung, breast, kidney, colon, stomach, and pancreas. In this
model, the MET-specific small-molecule kinase inhibitor SGX523 partially inhibits the HGF-dependent growth
of lung, breast, and pancreatic tumors. However, much greater growth suppression is achieved by combinatorial inhibition with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Together, these
results validate the hHGFtg-SCID mouse model for in vivo determination of MET sensitivity to drug inhibition.
Our findings also indicate that simultaneously targeting the MET and EGFR pathways can provide synergistic
inhibitory effects for the treatment of cancers in which both pathways are activated. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6880–90.

Introduction
MET receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, driven by its
unique biological ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is
a key signaling pathway that is not only essential for many
normal developmental and homeostatic processes but is also
responsible for the pathologic development and progression
of many human cancers (http://www.vai.org/met/; refs. 1, 2).
The complexity of the HGF-MET pathway arises from its
ability to induce diverse biological activities, ranging from
proliferation, motility, and invasion to survival and angiogenesis (1, 2), many of which are hallmark traits of cancer (3).
Multiple mechanisms can lead to an aberrant activation of
this pathway, including paracrine or autocrine signaling or
activating mutations in the receptor, all contributing to malignancy (1). Amplification or overexpression of MET and/or
HGF mediating paracrine or autocrine activation is observed

in almost all types of human solid tumors, whereas MET amplification or mutation causing inappropriate activation has
been identified in a few cancers of many different origins (1).
Inappropriate MET signaling has been identified as one of
the important pathways that cancer cells may use to bypass
growth inhibition caused by drugs targeting other pathways
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; refs. 4–6).
Many successes have been achieved by targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) with EGFR-, ErbB2-, or vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor–targeting drugs
to treat various human cancers (7). The compelling evidence
for the importance of the HGF-MET pathway in many human
cancers (1) suggests that it will also prove to be an effective
target for cancer therapy. Various strategies have been used
to interfere with the HGF-MET pathway (8), and a list of
MET drugs having promising therapeutic potential has been
developed (9–11). Among these are neutralizing antibodies
against either HGF or MET, and small-molecule inhibitors
that antagonize MET kinase activity (9–11). The development
of drugs targeting HGF or MET demands relevant preclinical
in vivo test systems in which tumorigenic activity due to MET
can be properly assessed and drug efficacy evaluated in many
cancer types.
Mouse HGF binds human MET with only low affinity and
does not potently activate human MET signaling (12).
Therefore, we previously generated a transgenic mouse
model expressing human HGF on an immune-compromised
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) background

MET Drug Preclinical Evaluation in a Human HGF Mouse Model

(hHGFtg-SCID). This background significantly enhances the
growth of MET-expressing human tumors by providing a
species-compatible ligand (13). Here, we show that the
hHGFtg-SCID mice can significantly promote subcutaneous
xenograft growth of many MET-expressing carcinoma cell
lines derived from a broad spectrum of organs including
lung, breast, kidney, colon, stomach, and pancreas. Furthermore, we show that SGX523, an exquisitely selective, ATPcompetitive small-molecule kinase inhibitor of MET (14), is
able to synergize with erlotinib to inhibit cell proliferation
in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in hHGFtg-SCID mice.
Our data show that the hHGFtg-SCID mouse can serve as a
unique and valuable animal model for preclinical testing of
MET drugs against various human cancers and for exploring better therapeutic strategies through administration of
MET drugs in combination with other cancer drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The NCI-H596, NCI-H1373, Colo205, DLD1, HT-29, MKN-45,
NCI-N87, and HCC1954 cell lines were cultured in RPMI
Medium 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; HyClone). The SW480, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-435, and 786-0 cell lines were cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Capan-2 cells were
cultured in McCoy's 5A (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS, and HPAF II cells were cultured in 50% DMEM plus 50%
MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. The NCIH596, NCI-H1373, Colo205, DLD-1, SW480, HCC1954, MDAMB-435, NCI-87, Capan-2, and HPAF II cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The
HT-29, MDA-MB-231, and 786-0 were from the NCI-60 cell
lines. The MKN-45 was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources.
Western blot analyses
Whole-cell lysates were extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate] supplemented with proteinase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche), and they were quantified using a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). The lysates were mixed with an
equal volume of 2× sample buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), denatured
in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes, and loaded onto a Trisglycine gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the proteins
were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
The primary antibodies used for the Western blot analyses
included anti-Met, anti-EGFR, anti-ErbB2, anti-ErbB3, and
anti-ErbB4 from Santa Cruz; anti-phospho-Met (Tyr1234/
1235), anti–phospho-ErbB3, anti–extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) 1/2, anti–phospho-ERK1/2, anti-Akt, and
anti–phospho-Akt from Cell Signaling Technology; anti–
phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) from Invitrogen; and anti-β actin
from Sigma. Following secondary antibody reaction, the
proteins were detected with ECL Western blotting Detection
Reagents (Amersham) by exposure on a Kodak film.

H-thymidine incorporation assay
For this assay, 1 × 104 cells were seeded in each well of a
96-well dish. After 48 hours of serum starvation, the cells
were treated with or without inhibitors of MET and/or EGFR,
accompanied with or without the stimulation of HGF and/or
EGF, for 20 hours. The cells were then treated with 1 μCi of
3
H-thymidine (GE Lifesciences) per well and incubated at
37°C for 4 hours. Following 3 H-thymidine incorporation,
the cells were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS, treated with
200 μL of ice-cold 5% TCA on ice for 20 minutes, washed
once with 95% ethanol, air-dried, and lysed in 75 μL of lysis
solution (0.02 N NaOH, 0.1% SDS) for 15 minutes. The cell
lysates were then transferred to a scintillation reader plate
(Wallac) with 200 μl of scintillation fluid (Perkin-Elmer).
The incorporated 3H radioactivity was measured as cpm in
the MicroBeta TriLux 1450 LSC & Luminescence Counter
(Perkin-Elmer). The assays were performed in triplicate for
each treatment.
Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle
Cells were seeded in six-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105
cells per well. After 24 hours of serum starvation, the cells
were stimulated with or without growth factors for 48 hours.
The cells were then harvested and stained with propidium
iodine for flow cytometry analysis. For drug treatments, the
cells were treated with or without drug for 1 hour before
stimulation with growth factor.
Tumor xenograft models
The breeding and genotyping of the hHGFtg-SCID mice has
been previously described (13). Female SCID mice aged 4 to
8 weeks were used for the experiments. Age-matched C3HSCID littermates from the same mating cages as the
hHGFtg-SCID mice were used as experimental controls. For
subcutaneous tumor formation, subconfluent cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free DMEM or RPMI at
concentrations of 5 to 20 × 106 cells/mL. Each animal received 100 μL of cell suspension injected s.c. into the right
dorsal area. Following cell injection, mice were monitored
for tumor formation twice weekly, and the dimensions of xenograft tumors were measured with manual calipers. The tumor volume was calculated by the formula volume (mm3) =
length × width × depth. All animal studies were conducted
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Van Andel Research Institute.
In vivo drug efficacy evaluation on xenograft tumor
To test the efficacy of SGX523 and/or erlotinib on xenograft
tumor growth, 40 tumor-bearing mice for each mouse strain
(either hHGFtg-SCID or C3H-SCID) were randomized into
four groups (10 mice/group) for the following treatments:
group 1, vehicle; group 2, erlotinib (150 mg/kg, once daily; refs.
15, 16); group 3, SGX523 (60 mg/kg, once daily); and group 4,
erlotinib (150 mg/kg, once daily) plus SGX523 (60 mg/kg, once
daily) combination. The erlotinib was dissolved in 0.5% (w/v)
Methocel A4M Premium (DOW Chemicals), and the SGX523
was dissolved in 0.5% (w/v) Methocel A4M Premium plus
0.05% Tween 80 in distilled water. Treatments were started

when the average tumor size reached ∼100 mm3, and drugs
were administered for 14 days through oral gavage. The tumor sizes were monitored and measured twice weekly.

Results
Paracrine HGF enhanced the xenograft growth of METexpressing human carcinomas in hHGFtg-SCID mice
Inappropriate expression of MET and/or its ligand HGF is
widely observed in almost all types of human cancers (http://
www.vai.org/met/; ref. 1). We have previously shown that the
growth of MET-expressing human xenografts, such as SKLMS-1 leiomyosarcoma cell tumors, is significantly accelerated in hHGFtg-SCID mice (13), indicating that human HGF in
the host mice can activate MET in the human tumor cell
lines through a paracrine mechanism.
To extend our understanding of how paracrine HGF-MET
activation contributes to tumor growth, we tested various
MET-expressing human cancer cell lines derived from a broad
spectrum of organ/tissue origins in the female hHGFtg-SCID
mouse model. These cell lines represented lung, colon, breast,
kidney, gastric, and pancreatic cancers (Table 1). Varied levels
of the MET receptor were detected in these carcinoma cell
lines; the levels of EGFR/ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family
members, especially EGFR and ErbB3, varied as well (Fig. 1A).
We chose female mice for our preclinical testing because the
concentration of circulating human HGF in female hHGFtgSCID mice was four times higher than in their male littermates, which allowed better growth of MET-expressing
tumors (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
Despite the variability in MET protein expression in the
carcinoma cell lines tested in Fig. 1, they all displayed a significant growth advantage when s.c. injected into hHGFtgSCID mice versus into control C3H-SCID animals (Fig. 1B).
The NCI-H1373, Colo205, DLD1, HT-29, SW480, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-435, MKN-45, NCI-N87, 786-0, and Capan-2 lines
showed a 1.5- to 2-fold xenograft tumor growth advantage
in the human HGF host environment (Table 1). By comparison, almost complete growth dependence was observed with
the human lung cancer cell line NCI-H596, the breast cancer
line HCC1954, and the pancreatic cancer line HPAF II in
hHGFtg-SCID mice, suggesting that paracrine activation of
the HGF-MET pathway is critical for the tumorigenicity of
these lines and in a sense reveals MET addiction in this mouse
model. This was striking, given that MET protein levels in the
NCI-H596 and HPAF II cells were not particularly high relative
to levels in other lines (Fig. 1A). Moreover, not all cancer cell
lines expressing MET showed a growth advantage in hHGFtgSCID mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). The discordance between
the level of MET protein and the growth advantage in hHGFtgSCID mice might be explained in part by high MET expression,
which can drive ligand-independent activation in addition to
the ligand-dependent paracrine activation.
Inhibition by SGX523 of MET and its downstream
signaling activations with or without erlotinib
The NCI-H596, NCI-H1373, HCC1954, and HPAF II cells all
express a high level of EGFR in addition to MET (Fig. 1A). With

6882

the exception of NCI-H596, the lines also express a moderate to
high level of ErbB3 (Fig. 1A). To assess the status of MET, EGFR,
and their downstream signaling in these cells, we treated them
with or without SGX523 and/or erlotinib before HGF or EGF
stimulation, and then performed Western blot analyses.
SGX523 inhibited MET phosphorylation and the downstream ERK and AKT activation in a dose-dependent manner, and at 1 μmol/L almost completely eliminated the
MET activation induced by HGF (Fig. 2). Although the inhibition of MET phosphorylation by SGX523 did not seem to
synergize with the addition of erlotinib, the suppression of
downstream ERK activation was clearly enhanced by the
combination of these two drugs (SGX523 at 200 nmol/L to
1 μmol/L with 5 μmol/L erlotinib) in NCI-H1373, HCC1954,
and HPAF II cells (Fig. 2B–D), but not in the NCI-H596 cells
(Fig. 2A). In NCI-H1373 cells, which express high levels of
MET and display constitutive MET phosphorylation, the
combination of SGX523 and erlotinib seemed to more
strongly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and EGFR
induced by EGF (Fig. 2B), suggesting possible cross-talk
between the MET and EGFR-ErbB3 pathways. However,
EGFR and/or ErbB3 phosphorylation was not affected by
SGX523 in the HCC1954, HPAF II, and NCI-H596 cells, which
express low to moderate levels of MET and show no ligandindependent MET phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, C, and D).
In vitro inhibition of carcinoma cell proliferation and
cell cycle progression by SGX523 and erlotinib
Proliferation of NCI-H1373, HCC1954, HPAF II, and Capan2 cells was induced 24 hours after HGF stimulation as measured by a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 3A and B).
However, NCI-H596 displayed enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation only at 48 hours and not at 24 hours after HGF
stimulation (data not shown; Fig. 3C), indicating a relatively
slow cell doubling property. To determine if blocking MET
activation impaired HGF-induced cell proliferation, we treated the cells with SGX523 together with HGF stimulation.
SGX523 strongly suppressed the HGF-induced proliferation
of NCI-H596 and Capan-2 cells (Fig. 3B and C), whereas only
moderate inhibition was observed for the NCI-H1373,
HCC1954, and HPAF II cells (Fig. 3A and B).
EGFR is strongly coexpressed with MET in the NCI-H596,
NCI-H1373, HCC1954, HPAF II, and Capan-2 cells (see Fig. 1A).
To determine if cross-talk between MET and EGFR influences proliferation, the cells were also treated with erlotinib
alone or with a combination of SGX523 and erlotinib. Erlotinib
alone, like SGX523, also significantly inhibited HGF-induced
proliferation of these cells (Fig. 3A–C), indicating that such
proliferation might be in part mediated by EGFR activation.
However, the inhibition was much greater, and the proliferation was far below the basal level when the cells were treated
with the combination of SGX523 and erlotinib in the presence
of HGF (Fig. 3A–C). This might be explained in part by the fact
that SGX523 and erlotinib combination almost completely
eliminated the basal and HGF-induced ERK and/or AKT phosphorylation in the presence of HGF (see Fig. 2). In contrast, the
proliferation of these cells in the absence of HGF (serum free
or induced by EGF alone) was completely suppressed by

erlotinib alone to the level seen when they were treated with
the SGX523/erlotinib combination in the presence of HGF
(Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 3A–C). The synergy of SGX523
and erlotinib in inhibiting cell proliferation in the presence
of HGF stimulation implies cross-talk between the MET and
EGFR pathways in these cells.
Both HGF and EGF can induce cell cycle progression in
NCI-H596 cells, as manifested by increasing cell counts in
the S phase (Fig. 3D). SGX523 strongly inhibited HGF-induced
cell cycle progression by reducing the number of cells in the S
phase from 32.72% to 9.53% (Fig. 3D). Erlotinib alone also provided significant inhibition of HGF-induced cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, but inhibition was maximized by the
combination of SGX523 and erlotinib, as the percentage of the
cells in the S phase was down to 5.49% (Fig. 3D). Interestingly,

www.aacrjournals.org

the EGF-induced cell cycle progression was inhibited only by
erlotinib but not by SGX523. This result is consistent with the
observation that erlotinib (but not SGX523) inhibited the 3Hthymidine–incorporating activity of NCI-H596 cells in the
presence of EGF stimulation (Fig. 3C).
Synergistic suppression of carcinoma xenograft growth

To determine the in vivo effect of SGX523 and/or erlotinib

and strongly suppressed NCI-H596 tumor xenograft growth
by 75% (Table 2; Fig. 4A). Strikingly, SGX523 displayed a much
stronger growth inhibition when treatment began immediately after the inoculation of NCI-H596 cells in mice: Tumor
growth was decreased by 83% relative to controls (Fig. 4B).
The SGX523/erlotinib combination also provided greater inhibition of the growth of xenografts derived from
HCC1954 breast cancer cells and HPAF II pancreatic cancer
cells in hHGFtg-SCID mice relative to single-agent treatment (Table 2; Fig. 4C and D). As summarized in Table 2,
HCC1954 tumor growth was suppressed by 84% with the
combination, compared with 69% by erlotinib (P = 0.0487)
and 51% by SGX523 (P = 0.0041) alone. HPAF II tumor
growth was down by 68% when treated with the combination, compared with 60% with erlotinib (P = 0.0265) and
32% with SGX523 (P = 0.00001) alone. However, in nontransgenic C3H-SCID mice, there was no significant difference in tumor growth inhibition between erlotinib alone

and the combination of SGX523/erlotinib (P = 0.425 for
HCC1954 and P = 0.492 for HPAF II; Table 2; Fig. 4C and
D). The efficacy of the two drugs on NCI-H596 xenografts in
the nontransgenic SCID mice was not evaluated due to
poor tumorigenicity (Table 1).
Taken together, our data suggest that SGX523 administered
in conjunction with erlotinib can provide a strong suppression
of tumor growth of human carcinomas and that the hHGFtgSCID mouse model can serve as a valuable tool for preclinical
drug evaluation of MET drugs alone or in combination. In addition, early treatment of tumors with MET drugs may provide
better drug efficacy against tumor growth (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
The MET receptor tyrosine kinase is the sole receptor recognized by HGF and, upon activation, promotes diverse
biological activities such as cell growth, motility, and morphogenesis in different cell contexts (1). Important roles of the
HGF-MET pathway in cancer have been unveiled by many
studies that have included the identification of mutations in

the MET gene, frequent observations of MET and/or HGF
overexpression in many types of human cancers, and the
in vitro and in vivo cancer-related functional activities of this
ligand-receptor pair, as well as tumorigenic and metastatic
studies in animal models (1, 2, 17). These studies have drawn
a great deal of interest and effort into developing drugs that
block the HGF-MET axis for targeted cancer intervention
(8). Various MET drugs targeting this pathway have emerged,
and several are currently in phase I/II clinical trials (9). Some
are selective drugs specifically targeting the HGF-MET, such
as Amgen's AMG102 anti-human HGF-neutralizing antibody
(18), Genentech's MetMAb anti-MET monovalent (one armed)
antibody (19), and ArQule's ARQ197 small-molecule kinase inhibitor of MET (9), whereas the others are multikinase inhibitors that simultaneously abolish the kinase activities of MET
and other RTKs (9–11).
Cancer drug development includes several critical steps:
identifying a potential therapeutic target, engineering a drug-

able reagent, preclinical evaluation in animal models, and, ultimately, clinical trials. Preclinical evaluation is critical not
only for determining the efficacy and safety of a drug, but also
in helping to identify the patient groups most likely to benefit
from the drug, alone or in combination. The common preclinical approach is to test a drug against tumor xenografts raised
in immune-compromised athymic nude or SCID mice. However, because mouse HGF has a very low affinity for and activity
on the human MET receptor (12), these models do not mimic
the full range of MET activation in human cancers. The
hHGFtg-SCID mouse, a genetically engineered strain that produces human HGF/SF (13), overcomes this limitation. The
hHGFtg-SCID mice strongly enhance the xenograft growth of
MET-expressing tumors such as the SK-LMS-1 leiomyosarcoma model (13), which is a valuable system for evaluating MET
drugs such as AMG102 (20).
Because aberrant MET activation is observed in a
wide spectrum of human carcinomas and sarcomas

MET Drug Preclinical Evaluation in a Human HGF Mouse Model

(http://www.vai.org/met/), MET drugs could have therapeutic
value in most types of human cancer. In this report, we explored various human carcinoma cells implanted in hHGFtgSCID mice as in vivo carcinoma xenograft systems suitable for
human MET drug evaluation. We showed that the hHGFtgSCID mice significantly enhanced xenograft growth of many
human MET-expressing carcinomas derived from lung, breast,
gastric, pancreatic, colon, and kidney (Fig. 1B). These data provided straightforward in vivo evidence that paracrine
activation of the HGF-MET pathway is critical for the tumorigenicity of many human carcinomas. Among the tested cancer lines, NCI-H596, HCC1954, and HPAF II displayed
particularly strong HGF-dependent xenograft growth. The
presence of human HGF in the SCID host environment dramatically shortened the times required for these cell lines to
develop tumors, enhanced tumor takes, and/or greatly advanced the growth rate of their xenografts (Table 1).
Nonetheless, not all MET-expressing cancer cell lines displayed a significant growth advantage in the hHGFtg-SCID
mice (Supplementary Fig. S3), and HGF-dependent xenograft
growth did not necessarily parallel the level of MET protein
expressed. It remains to be determined if ligand-independent
or autocrine MET activation is accountable for the uncoupling
of MET protein levels detected in the cells and the HGF-dependent
xenograft growth in the hHGF tg -SCID mice. In addition,
neither the scale of ERK and/or AKT activation downstream
of MET (Fig. 2), nor the levels of in vitro cell proliferative activity induced by HGF (Fig. 3) predicted how cell growth might
respond in the hHGFtg-SCID mice (Fig. 1). These observations
may not be surprising in light of the fact that the HGF-MET
axis contributes to many key tumorigenic events including cell
proliferation, motility, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis.
Cell lines of different origins may depend to different extents
on MET signaling for these processes and may vary in their
requirements for the level of MET expression and HGF stimulation of the pathway.
It is noteworthy that the NCI-H596 cells displayed almost
absolute dependence on the HGF-MET pathway for xenograft
growth (Fig. 1B). NCI-H596 is a non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) line carrying an intronic mutation in the MET gene
(19). The mutation causes an abnormal splicing of the exon 14
and results in a shorter form of the MET receptor lacking its
juxtamembrane domain, which contains a Cbl-binding site
(19). Consequently, the MET mutant can no longer be regulated by Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, causing a
more sustained MET activation upon HGF stimulation of
these cells (19). Contrary to this extreme growth dependence,
established NCI-H596 xenograft growth was only partially inhibited by SGX523 (Fig. 4A), which suppressed MET phosphorylation and downstream ERK and AKT activation (Fig. 2A),
and also impaired proliferation and cell cycle progression of
NCI-H596 cells induced by HGF in vitro (Fig. 3C and D).
However, SGX523 had a much stronger inhibitory activity on
residual tumor growth when administered concurrent with
inoculation (Fig. 4B), indicating that early treatment of tumors
with MET drugs may achieve a better therapeutic outcome.
Similar to SGX523, another MET drug, MetMAb, also partially inhibited established NCI-H596 xenograft growth in

www.aacrjournals.org

hHGFtg-SCID mice (21), suggesting that the cells might rely
on other signaling pathways to evade HGF-MET pathway inhibition. This seems to be true because a much greater
suppression of NCI-H596 xenograft growth in hHGFtg-SCID
mice was achieved by the combination of SGX523 with erlotinib (Table 2; Fig. 4A) or of MetMAb with erlotinib (21), relative
to individual drug treatment alone. Consistent with the in vivo
efficacy (Fig. 4A), the SGX523/erlotinib combination also
showed synergy in vitro, inhibiting cell proliferation (Fig. 3C)
and causing an enhanced impairment of NCI-H596 cell cycle
progression from G1 to S phase in the presence of HGF (Fig.
3D). These data indicated that simultaneous targeting of the
MET and EGFR pathways can provide a synergistic inhibitory
effect on the growth of NCI-H596 lung cancer. Strikingly, it was
recently reported that a combination of erlotinib and the MET
inhibitor ARQ197 significantly improved median progressionfree survival by 66% in patients with advanced NSCLC cancer
in a phase II clinical trial (22). This promising clinical data, in
conjunction with our results, supports that the hHGFtg-SCID
xenograft model is a sound preclinical system for exploring
optimal cancer therapeutic strategies involving MET drugs,
and drug evaluation in this system can be used to help predict
clinical therapeutic outcome.
Likewise, a combination of SGX523 and erlotinib may also
provide stronger suppression of the growth of HCC1954 and
HPAF II xenografts in hHGFtg-SCID mice perhaps due to additive effects of the two drugs (Table 2; Fig. 4C and D). Neither
displayed as robust combinatorial suppression as with NCIH596 (Fig. 4A). More importantly, the enhanced suppression
of tumor xenograft growth by the SGX523/erlotinib combination was observed only in hHGF tg -SCID mice (Table 2),
indicating that the hHGFtg-SCID mouse model is an excellent
in vivo system for preclinically evaluating not only MET drugs
but also their combinations with other cancer drugs. This is
further exemplified by the observation that a combination of
MetMAb and anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody also displayed
synergistic inhibition on NCI-H596 xenograft growth (23).
Taken together, we showed here that hHGFtg-SCID mice
can enhance the xenograft growth of many human carcinoma cell lines through paracrine MET expression, and we have
provided evidence that these xenograft models can serve as
valuable tools for preclinical evaluation of MET drugs alone
or in combination with other cancer drugs. We are confident
that the hHGFtg-SCID mouse system can provide unique
strength for facilitating the development of MET drugs
against various human cancers.
