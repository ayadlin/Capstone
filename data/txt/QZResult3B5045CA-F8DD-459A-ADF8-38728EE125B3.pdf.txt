BACKGROUND. CD100, a class IV semaphorin, promotes angiogenesis, invasive
growth, proliferation, and antiapoptosis of cancer cells in vitro. The expression of
CD100 in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and its correlation with clinicopathologic factors and prognostic significance were evaluated.

METHODS. Expression levels of CD100 in patients with localized STS were evaluated immunohistochemically on paraffin-embedded sections from 81 patients,
including 47 men and 34 women with a median age of 54 years. Staining intensity was categorized into weaker than (level 1) or equal to that of lymphocytes
with a rate of <10% stained tumor cells (level 2) or >10% stained tumor cells
(level 3). Ki-67 staining was performed in parallel.

RESULTS. Forty-two tumors (52%) had level 1 CD100 expression, 18 tumors (22%)
had level 2 CD100 expression, and 21 tumors (26%) had level 3 CD100 expres-

sion. Tumors that had level 2 and 3 CD100 expression were correlated significantly with higher mitotic count, cellularity, ratio of necrosis, and Ki-67 labeling
index (LI) compared with tumors that had level 1 CD100 expression. There was
no correlation between CD100 expression and other characteristics. Among the 3
levels of CD100 expression, higher expression levels were correlated with poorer
overall and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that CD100
expression (levels 1 and 2 vs level 3) and tumor size (5 cm vs >5 cm) were independent prognosticators for overall survival (P < .05 for both), and CD100
expression (levels 1 and 2 vs level 3) was an independent prognosticator for disease-free survival (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study indicated the demonstrated prognostic
significance of CD100 expression in STS. Cancer 2007;110:164–72.  2007

D100, a class IV semaphorin, is a 150-kilodalton, homodimeric
glycoprotein that is expressed strongly in human lymphoid tissues, skeletal muscle, and (at lower levels) brain.1 The biologic activity of CD100 is well characterized in the immune system: as a
receptor, CD100 enhances T-cell proliferation; as a ligand, it promotes the aggregation and survival of B cells and the activation and
maturation of antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) through interaction with the low-affinity receptor CD72.1–4
Soluble dimeric CD100 shedding from the cell surface inhibits the
migration of monocytes and B cells through the high-affinity receptor plexin-B1.5,6 CD100, as a semaphorin, also acts as a guidance
molecule for axonal path finding in the nervous system through
interaction with plexin-B1.7,8
However, cumulative findings suggest wider roles for CD100.

in endothelial cells.9 Signaling through a complex receptor of plexin-B1 and Met, CD100 promotes invasive the growth of epithelial cells.10 Because it has
been demonstrated that Met, a member of the scatter factor receptor family, is associated with several
aspects of cancer development, such as scattering,
angiogenesis, proliferation, enhanced cell motility,
invasion, and eventual metastasis,11 it also has been
speculated that CD100 is involved in the development of cancer.
Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous
group of malignant mesenchymal tumors that are
classified histologically based on their morphologic
features.12 Although they are within the same histologic categories of STSs, various grades of malignancy
with different prognoses have been identified. To
predict the malignant potential of each STS more
accurately, several histologic grading systems have
been introduced.13,14 Histologic features like mitotic
activity, degree of cellularity, and necrosis have been
incorporated as core components in most grading
systems for STS.13,15,16 Biologic features revealed by
immunohistochemical methods may provide additional information to guide better grading and, thus,
better management of STS.13 In the current study,
the expression of CD100 in STS was examined
immunohistochemically, and its relation with clinicopathologic factors and prognostic significance were
evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eighty-one patients with localized STS in the trunk
and extremities were selected for the current study.
They were treated at the Orthopedic Division of
Osaka University Hospital during the period from
July 1992 to November 2000. There were 47 men and
34 women, and they ranged in age from 15 years to
89 years (median age, 54 years). The tumors were
located in the upper extremities in 16 patients, the
trunk in 26 patients, and the lower extremities in 39
patients. Tumor stage according to the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)17 classification
was as follows: 10 patients had stage IA tumors, 16
patients had stage IB tumors, 12 patients had stage
IIA tumors, 2 patients had stage IIB tumors, and 34
patients had stage III tumors. Seven patients had
tumors that could not be classified because of insufficient clinical information. Forty-eight patients
underwent wide local excision, and 2 patients underwent amputation. Thirteen patients did not undergo
wide local excision because of neurovascular involvement in 6 patients and extremely large tumors in 7

patients. Among these 13 patients, 9 patients developed a local recurrence of their tumor, and 8 of
those patients underwent surgery for recurrent
tumors. These 13 patients were not included in the
analysis of tumor recurrence. The remaining 18
patients initially underwent marginal or intralesional
excision at other hospitals.
Surgical resection specimens were fixed in 10%
formalin and were processed routinely for paraffin
embedding. Histologic sections cut at 4 mm thickness
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and were
reviewed by 3 pathologists (Y.T., Y.H., K.A.). Immunohistochemical procedures (the avidin-biotin complex
[ABC] method) were performed if necessary for diagnosis. Histologic classification and histologic tumor
factors, such as mitotic count, cellularity, pleomorphism, necrosis, sclerotic change, and myxoid change,
were evaluated. Distribution of histologic classification according to the World Health Organization12 is
shown in Table 1.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was received by 42
patients (preoperative in 9 patients, postoperative in
6 patients, and both preoperative and postoperative
in 27 patients) who had high risk factors for tumor
metastasis, such as high histologic grade or large tumor size. The following chemotherapeutic agents
were used: Ifosphamide (IFM) alone was received by
1 patient; doxorubicin (DXR) or its analogues and
IFM were received by 8 patients; DXR and cisplatinum (CDDP) or its derivative were received by 4
patients; IFM and etoposide (VP16) were received by
1 patient; DXR and VP16 were received by 1 patient;
IFM, DXR, and CDDP were received by 17 patients;
IFM, vindesine, DXR, and dacarbazine (IFOVADIC)
were received by 4 patients; IFOVADIC and CDDP
were received by 5 patients; and IFOVADIC, CDDP,
and VP16 were received by 1 patient. Radiotherapy
was received by 6 of 31 patients who underwent

marginal or intralesional excision for their primary
tumor and by 9 of 50 patients who underwent wide
local excision or amputation. Radiotherapy was
received by 1 patient with a general condition that
was tolerable to radiotherapy and by 2 patients who
had local tumor recurrences that may have caused
immense impediment or may have been inoperable.
Informed consent for participation in the current
study was obtained from all patients.

Immunohistochemistry for CD100 and Ki-67
Immunoperoxidase procedures (the ABC method)
were performed on paraffin-embedded sections. For
antigen retrieval, sections were heated in 10 mM
citrate buffer for 5 minutes. Anti-CD100 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif) and anti-Ki-67 (clone MIB1)
monoclonal antibodies (Dako Cytomation A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) were used as the primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:50, respectively.
Sections were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin for CD100 or with methyl green for Ki-67. Lymph
node breast resection specimens from women with
breast cancer were used as external positive controls
and were stained in parallel with the STS sections.
Lymphocytes within the same sections were used as
internal positive controls. For negative controls,
immunohistochemistry with antiepithelial membrane
antigen (anti-EMA; Dako Cytomation) was performed. To assess the reproducibility of CD100
immunohistochemistry, the immunohistochemical
procedure was repeated twice independently, and the
staining patterns were compared.
Tumor cells showed membrane and cytoplasmic
staining for CD100. Total numbers of tumor cells per
10 high-power fields were counted, and the ratio of
CD100-positive cells was calculated in each section.
At least 200 tumor cells were examined for each
patient with STS. The staining intensity of CD100 in
each tumor was categorized as follows: level 1, staining weaker than that in the small lymphocytes; level
2, staining equal to that in lymphocytes with <10%
tumor cells; and level 3, staining in 10% of tumor
cells. CD100 staining was evaluated independently
by 2 of the authors (E.C. and B.Z.). The results were
compared and were discussed for patients with discrepant findings.
For Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, cells that
showed intranuclear staining were considered Ki-67positive. The number of Ki-67-positive cells among
200 tumor cells were counted, and the percentage
was used as the Ki-67 labeling index (LI). Tumors
were divided into the following 2 groups: level 1, Ki67 LI <20%; and level 2, Ki-67 LI 20%.

FIGURE 1. CD100 immunohistochemistry. (A) Level 1: Tumor cells show
weaker CD100 expression compared with infiltrating lymphocytes. (B) Level
2: Less than 10% of tumor cells show strong CD100 expression. (C) Level 3:
Most of the tumor cells show strong CD100 expression.

Follow-up
Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 132 months
(median, 60 months). The actuarial overall and disease-free 5-year survival rates were 67% and 41%,
respectively. Distant metastasis occurred in 33
patients (41%), and 29 of those patients (88%) died

from their tumors. Local recurrence occurred in 37
patients (46%), and 16 of those patients died from
their tumors. The rate of local recurrence for each
surgical procedure was as follows: 0% for amputation, 27% for wide-local excision, 91% for marginal
excision, and 100% for intralesional excision.

Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using JMP software
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Correlation among
each clinicopathologic factors was evaluated by using
the chi-square test. Overall and disease-free survival
rates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier
methods,18 and differences in the survival curves
were analyzed by using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic factors were analyzed with a Cox proportional-hazards regression model in a stepwise
manner.19 A P value <.05 denoted a statistically significant difference.

RESULTS
CD100 Expression in STS
Tumor cells in 42 tumors had weaker staining for
CD100 compared with that observed in lymphocytes
(Fig. 1A) and, thus, were classified with level 1
CD100 expression. Eighteen tumors that had strong
staining similar to that of lymphocytes in <10% of
tumor cells were classified with level 2 CD100
expression (Fig. 1B). The remaining 21 tumors
showed strong staining in >10% of tumor cells and

were classified with level 3 CD100 expression (Fig.
1C). Five tumors (24%), 7 tumors (33%), and 9
tumors (43%) had strong staining in 10% to 30% of
tumor cells, in 30% to 50% of tumor cells, and in
>50% of tumor cells, respectively. Immunohistochemistry with anti-EMA did not result in positive
staining. With regard to the level of CD100 expression in tumor cells, an identical judgment was
obtained in 78 of 81 tumors (96%). The remaining 3
tumors were discussed to reach a consensus. Correlations between CD100 expression and other clinicopathologic factors are shown in Table 2. Most
patients who had liposarcoma showed level 1 expression (P < .01), but expression levels varied among the
other histologic subtypes. Tumors with level 2 and 3
expression had the greatest mitotic counts (P < .001),
a greater degree of cellularity (P < .001), a higher ratio of necrosis (P < .01), and a higher Ki-67 LI
(P < .01) compared with tumors that had level 1
expression. The ratio of Ki-67 positivity among
CD100-positive and CD100-negative tumor cells did
not differ in tumors with level 2 and level 3 CD100
expression. No significant correlation was observed
among other factors.

Univariate and Multivariate Analyses for Prognostic
Factors of STS
Significant differences were observed between the 3
groups in CD100 expression levels for both overall
survival (P < .01) and disease-free survival (P < .05)
(Fig. 2). Univariate analysis revealed that mitotic

tumors according to AJCC stage differed between the 2
groups; 8 of 38 patients (21%) who did not receive
chemotherapy and 26 of 43 patients (60%) who did
receive chemotherapy had AJCC stage III disease.
Multivariate analysis with the factors that had
proven significance in the univariate analysis indicated that CD100 expression and tumor size were independent prognosticators for overall survival, and
CD100 expression was an independent prognosticator for disease-free survival (Table 4). CD100 expression proved to be a prognosticator for overall
survival in patients with AJCC stage II and III disease
(P < .01).

count, cellularity, cellular pleomorphism, necrosis,
Ki-67 LI, tumor size, and CD100 expression level had
prognostic significance for overall survival; and the
CD100 expression level had prognostic significance
for disease-free survival (Table 3). Patients who
underwent intralesional excision had the worst overall survival compared with patients who underwent
other kinds of surgery (P < .001) (Table 3). These
patients had huge tumors with neurovascular involvement and, thus, could not undergo curative surgery.
Patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy
had a better overall survival than patients who received

Recently, many studies have been designed to investigate the prognostic factors of STS by using immunohistochemical methods.20 Most of the published
data have focused on the expression of markers for
cell kinetics and regulatory proteins of the cell cycle.
Among them, it has been reported widely that Ki-67,
a proliferation marker, is correlated with a poor clinical outcome in patients with STS.21,22 In good agreement with previously reported data, the Ki-67 LI in
the current study also was identified as an independent poor prognosticator for overall survival.
Conversely, other investigators have focused their
studies on correlation between the expression of membrane proteins with known cellular functions and clinical outcome. Among them, reductions in the
expression of E-cadherin and catenins, proteins that
are essential for forming intercellular junctions, were
reported as prognosticators of a poor outcome in
patients with STS, implying that decreases in cell-tocell adhesion may cause tumor cell dissemination.22
The functions of CD100 have been explored
extensively; however, information regarding the
expression of CD100 in human cancers and its clinical implication is limited. The current study was conducted in such background to explore the clinical
relevance of CD100 expression. Patients with STS
were used for this explorative study, because it is
well known that CD100 is expressed in skeletal and
nervous tissues.1
It has been demonstrated that CD100 acts as a
receptor in T cells to promote proliferation.2 In
addition, CD100 acts as a ligand in its soluble form,
shedding from cell membranes. Through binding to
receptor plexin-B1, CD100 promotes angiogenesis,
invasive growth, proliferation, and antiapoptosis of
cancer cells in vitro.9,10,23 Furthermore, it enhances
CD40-induced proliferation of B cells through

receptor CD72.1 The manifold functions of CD100,
both as a ligand and as a receptor, favor cell survival and proliferation; thus, its expression may act
as an indicator of malignant grade in cancers. In
fact, the current study revealed that higher CD100
expression in STS was correlated with higher proliferative potentials, as implied by higher mitotic
count, higher Ki-67 LI, and greater degree of cellularity. Moreover, with regard to clinical progression,
CD100 proved to be an independent prognosticator
for a poor outcome in patients with STS. CD100
was a useful prognosticator in patients who had
STS in advanced AJCC stages (II and III), suggesting

its utility in the stratification of high-risk patients
with STS.
The prognostic significance of CD100 staining
was evaluated with several cut-off values. Consequently, it became evident that a cut-off value at 10%
could be used to differentiate patients with STS into
favorable and poor prognostic groups. When this cutoff value was used, CD100 immunohistochemistry
showed the same staining pattern in the 2 series of
experiments, indicating the reproducibility of the
staining. Two examiners were identical in their determinations of CD100 expression levels in all but 3
specimens, indicating the reproducibility of the evaluation process. Most specimens with liposarcoma
showed level 1 CD100 expression, whereas expression
levels varied among the other histologic subtypes.
Further investigation will be necessary to clarify the
mechanism of CD100 expression in STS. CD100 was
not detectable in stromal tissue or endothelial cells,
but muscles showed faint staining. These results are
consistent with previous reports on CD100 expression
in nonneoplastic cells.5,6,23 In patients with STS who
had level 2 and 3 CD100 expression, the ratio of
CD100-positive tumor cells was consistent among
areas of the slide examined. In the current study,
CD100 expression levels were expressed as the ratio
of positive tumor cells, because cell size and cellularity varied among tumors.
Dorfman et al. reported that CD100 was expressed in most peripheral T-cell lymphomas but not
in many types of B-cell lymphomas, except for small
noncleaved lymphomas and a few follicular lymphomas.24 Those authors suggested an important role for
CD100 in T-cell lymphomagenesis.24 However, the
overexpression of plexin-B1, which is a CD100 receptor, together with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, has been reported in several human cancer cell
lines.10 However, our preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of the receptors to CD100, CD72 and

plexin-B1, with the use of commercially available
antibodies, did not yield consistent staining; therefore, those receptors were not evaluated in the current study. We also noted that CD40, which is a
tumor necrosis factor receptor family protein that, in
conjunction with CD100, promotes B-cell proliferation in vitro, was recently reported as a poor prognosticator in patients with STS.25 Therefore, further
investigation will be needed to clarify the relations
among CD100 through CD72, CD100/plexin-B1,
CD40. and clinical outcome.
In conclusion, this study with an explorative
objective revealed that CD100 expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry, may be a new biologic prognosticator for STS and may provide useful
information for better clinical management. Further
analysis with much more consistent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy will be necessary to establish CD100 expression as a prognosticator for STS.
