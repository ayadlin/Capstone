ABSTRACT
Glioma has become a significant global health problem with substantial morbidity
and mortality, underscoring the importance of elucidating its underlying molecular
mechanisms. Recent studies have identified mir-218 as an anti-oncogene; however,
the specific functions of mir-218-1 and mir-218-2 remain unknown, especially the
latter. The objective of this study was to further investigate the role of mir-218-2
in glioma. Our results indicated that mir-218-2 is highly overexpressed in glioma.
Furthermore, we showed that mir-218-2 is positively correlated with the growth,
invasion, migration, and drug susceptibility (to β-lapachone) of glioma cells. In
vitro, the overexpression of mir-218-2 promoted glioma cell proliferation, invasion,
and migration. In addition, the overexpression of mir-218-2 in vivo was found to
increase glioma tumor growth. Accordingly, the inhibition of mir-218-2 resulted in
the opposite effects. Cell division cycle 27 (CDC27), the downstream target of mir218-2, is involved in the regulation of glioma cells. Our results indicate that the
overexpression of CDC27 counteracted the function of mir-218-2 in glioma cells.
These novel findings provide new insight in the application of mir-218-2 as a potential
glioma treatment.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small noncoding RNA molecules of approximately 20–23 nucleotides.
After transcription, cleavage, and biological modification
with the help of a series of RNA polymerases, the singlestranded RNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), which is the cytoplasmic effector
machine for miRNA. Upon complementary binding to the
related miRNA at the untranslated 3′ region within RISC,
posttranscriptional RNA silencing induces target mRNA
cleavage, translational inhibition, or decay [6]. Thus, mRNA
interference results in a decreased level of protein encoding
thereby affecting a range of cellular processes such as
proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Several
miRNAs have been found to be aberrantly expressed in
glioma tumor samples compared to normal brain tissue. mir10b [7] and mir-21 [8] are significantly increased in gliomas
and the down-regulation of these miRNAs decreases the
malignancy of glioma cell lines. mir-7 [9], mir-34a [9, 10],

INTRODUCTION
The high incidence, rapid recurrence, and poor
survival estimates of glioma makes it the most common
malignant central nervous system tumor [1, 2]. Glioma
is characterized by sustained proliferation, enhanced
invasion and migration, and various cytogenetic and
molecular abnormalities. To date, surgery [3], followed
by radiotherapy [4] and chemotherapy [5], is the standard
treatment regimen; however, drug susceptibility has
become another intractable problem. Indeed, despite
advances in cancer treatment, the prognosis for patients
with glioma remains poor and <5% of patients survive
for 5 years after diagnosis [3]. Moreover, the underlying
molecular mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.
Accordingly, there is an urgency in identifying the
molecular mechanisms involved in order to identify novel
targets for clinical therapies.

and mir-218 [11] are significantly repressed in glioma cell
lines and tumor samples, modulating oncogenes and tumor
suppressors through numerous direct gene interactions.
Therefore, miRNAs may have great potential in the future
treatment of this disease.
mir-218 is an intronic miRNA encoded by two
different slit genes, mir-218-1 and mir-218-2, which
are located within an intron of SLIT2 and SLIT3,
respectively [12]. mir-218 has been reported to be highly
downregulated in some tumor samples and is thought to
participate in tumor progression [13–15]. However, the
expression of mir-218-1 and mir-218-2, especially for
the later, as well as their functional significance in glioma
remains largely unknown. mir-218-1 and mir-218-2 share
the same 5p sequence as mir-218-5p, whereas they vary in
3p, which constitute mir-218-1 and mir-218-2 respectively.
Here we report that mir-218-2 is highly expressed in
glioma cell lines and promotes glioma growth, invasion,
and migration, as well as drug susceptibility through its
targeting of Cell Division Cycle 27 (CDC27).
CDC27 is one of the twelve different subunits of
the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), a large multiprotein complex that regulates chromosome segregation
and mitotic exit by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cell
cycle regulators [16]. Recent studies have shown that
specific regions in CDC27, such as tetratricopeptide repeats
(TPRs), are cross-linked to APC/C binding sites through
CDC20 and Cdh1, which are coactivators involved in the
APC/C-mediated ubiquitination of securin and cyclins [17].
Using bioinformatics, we have shown that the 3′-UTR of
CDC27 contains two potential binding elements for mir218-2, with a 7-nt region matching with the mir-218-2 seed
region. Accordingly, we hypothesized that mir-218-2 may
have a role in the regulation of CDC27 expression at the
posttranscriptional level, leading to a dysfunction in APC/C
and, ultimately, to abnormalities in tumor progression.
Beta-lapachone (β-lap), a novel anti-tumor agent
first isolated from the lapachone tree (genus Tabebuia),
has shown considerable cancer specificity by selectively
increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative
stress in breast cancer cells [18]. It has also been reported
to cause cellular necrosis in pancreatic and lung cancers,
as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma [19, 20]. Moreover,
the reported ability of β-lap to induce ROS generation has
been shown to mediate autophagic cell death in glioma
U87 MG cells [21]. The results from this study indicate
that overexpression of mir-218-2 results in decreased
sensitivity to β-lap by decreasing ROS generation.

investigated the levels of mature mir-218-2 expression in
five normal brain tissue samples, eight cases of grade I
and II gliomas, and eleven cases of grade III-V gliomas.
As is shown in Figure 1A, the expression level of mir-2182-3p in glioma was significantly upregulated compared
to the normal brain tissues and this phenomenon was
particularly evident in the higher-grade glioma specimens.
mir-218-2 was also overexpressed in the glioma cell
lines U251, U87, and U118 compared to the human glia
cell line (Figure 1B). In these cells, mir-218-1-3p was
downregulated indicating that mir-218-2 may play a
different role in glioma progression. In order to further
investigate the potential biological function of mir-218-2
in the tumorigenesis of glioma, we infected U251 and U87
cells with a lentivirus encoding hsa-mir-218-2 or the antisense to has-mir-218-2 (mir-218-2 inhibited), respectively
(Figure 1C and 1D).

RESULTS

mir-218-2 increases glioma proliferation and
drug resistance in vitro

mir-218-2 induced glioma cell invasion,
migration, and actin organization
The invasion of tumor cells through the extra
cellular matrix is an important step in tumor invasion. The
matrigel-coated transwell assay serves as a reconstituted
basement membrane matrix and in vitro model system for
assessing tumor cell invasiveness. As is shown in Figure
2A and 2B, the invasive capacity of U251 and U87 cells
is increased upon infection with mir-218-2 and decreased
when mir-218-2 expression was inhibited. No statistical
differences were found among the mir-218-2 control
group (mir-218-2 CG), the mir-218-2 inhibited control
group (mir-218-2 inhibited CG), and the non-treated
group. Next, matrigel-uncoated transwell and scratch
wound assays (Figure 2C–2F) demonstrated that mir218-2 overexpression markedly raised the invasiveness
of glioma. The wound was significantly closed in cells
overexpressing mir-218-2 when compared to the vectorcontrol cells. As cytoskeleton recombination affects
the adhesion and migration of cells [22], we stained the
cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to visualize
the changes in actin organization (Figure 2G and 2H).
An increase in F-actin staining was observed in the cells
overexpressing mir-218-2, with F-actin-rich membrane
protrusions being clearly observable. In the mir-218-2
and CG groups, as well as in the non-treated group, stress
fibers were clearly observed at the cell periphery and the
cell center, and there were far fewer in the mir-218-2
inhibited group.

and tissue specimens

Next, we investigated the effects of mir-218-2 on
cell proliferation. As is shown in Figure 3A, the results of
CCK8 assays demonstrated that the mir-218-2-inhibited
glioma cells exhibited a significantly decreased rate of

cytometry, we found that the percentage of U251 and
U87 cells in S phase was significantly higher in the mir218-2 group than in the control group (Figure 3B and

3C), and significantly lower in the mir-218-2-inhibited
group. Indeed, an obvious cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1
phase was observed in the mir-218-2-inhibited group.
In addition, colony formation assays demonstrated that

the glioma cells overexpressing mir-218-2 generated
significantly more and larger colonies than in the CG
groups (Figure 3D and 3E). These data clearly demonstrate
the involvement of mir-218-2 in glioma cell proliferation.

We also investigated whether mir-218-2 could
modulate the anti-cancer function of β-lap, a new anticancer agent that has been reported to activate multiple
mechanisms of cell death in cancer cells, including

apoptosis [18, 19, 21]. As a result, we examined
cytotoxicity using CCK8 assays. In response to β-lap, cell
viability was decreased in a dose- (2–5 μM) and time(0–12 h) dependent manner, as shown in Figure 3F and
3G. mir-218-2 overexpression significantly decreased
the proportion of dead cells, whereas its knockdown
enhanced apoptosis. To further verify the role of mir-2182 in β-lap resistance, we assessed how overexpression and
knockdown affected the generation of ROS with 4 μM
β-lap followed by flow cytometry analysis. ROS levels,
labeled using ROS BriteTM 670, increased primarily in the
mir-218-2-inhibited group, and less ROS were seen in the
CGs and the mir-218-2 group (Figure 3H). These results
suggest that mir-218-2 is involved in the regulation of
β-lap chemosensitivity in glioma cells.

of mir-218-2. To this end, we restored the expression
of CDC27 in the mir-218-2 overexpressed cells with a
specific plasmid (Figure 4E and 4F). As is shown in Figure
4G and 4H, the re-expression of CDC27 partially rescued
mir-218-2-induced cell proliferation. Together, these data
implicate CDC27 as a functionally relevant target of mir218-2 in glioma cells.

mir-218-2 promotes glioma progression through
the CDC27/APC ubiquitin–proteasome pathway
Because CDC27 is an important coactivator for
APC/C-mediated ubiquitination of securin and cyclins
[17], we further detected the expression of securin and
several important cyclins at the protein level. As is shown
in Figure 5A–5E, protein levels of securin, cyclinA1/2,
cyclinB1, and cyclinD1 were increased as a consequence
of CDC27 decline in the mir-218-2 group. In addition,
decreasing the levels of mir-218-2 expression also
decreased the levels of securin, cyclinA1/2, cyclinB1, and
cyclinD1. However, the expression of cyclinB2 remained
unchanged in each group. Restoration of CDC27 by
transfecting the plasmid into mir-218-2 cells reversed
the effects of mir-218-2 in glioma cells compared to the
vector. Taken together, these data suggest that mir-218-2
modulates the APC/Cubiquitin–proteasome pathway by
targeting CDC27 in glioma cells. Moreover, taking into
account that adhesion and cell junction proteins, such as
E-cadherin [23, 24], β-catenin [25], focal adhesion kinase
(FAK)[26], and vinculin [27] play important roles in cell
migration and invasion, we determined their levels of
expression by performing Western blotting (Figure 5F–
5I). The expression of E-cadherin, in contrast to βcatenin,
was decreased in the mir-218-2 group compared to the
CGs. However, phosphorylation of βcatenin, which is the
deactivated form of βcatenin recognized by E3 ubiquitin
ligase, was upregulated in the mir-218-2-inhibited cells.
Furthermore, both vinculin and phosphorylated FAK, the
activated form of FAK, were found to be upregulated in
the mir-218-2 groups, whereas FAK (un-phosphorylated)
maintained similar levels of expression among all groups.
Taken together, our findings suggest that mir-218-2
promotes glioma progression through the CDC27/APC
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and promotes the invasion,
migration, and actin organization through the modulation
of cell junction and focal adhesion proteins (Figure 5J).

CDC27 is a direct target of mir-218-2
Using the specific bioinformatic program MirDB
(http://mirdb.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi), we got a series of
targets of mir-218-2, among which we locked CDC27 for
its defined function in regulating APC/C and ubiquitination
in tumor. Moreover, CDC27 has got 2 binding site for Mir218-2-3p. CDC27 was found to be a putative target of
mir-218-2 with two highly conserved 3′-UTR sequences
in the CDC27 3′-UTR pairing with mammalian mir-2182 (Figure 4A). To further investigate this, we evaluated
CDC27 protein levels in glioma cell lines compared to
normal human glia cells. Our results indicated a decline
in CDC27 protein levels in glioma cells (Figure 4B). We
then verified this potential binding by performing Western
blots for both the overexpressed and inhibited groups, as
well as in their respective CGs. Cells infected with the
mir-218-2 lentivirus had significantly decreased CDC27
expression at the protein level, whereas cells transfected
with antagomir-218-2 had significantly enhanced CDC27
expression (Figure 4C). To further confirm the direct
interaction between mir-218-2 and CDC27, we cloned a
reporter vector in which luciferase cDNA was followed
by a fragment of the 3′-UTR from the CDC27 mRNA
containing the two mir-218-2 binding sites (designated as
wild-type, WT). Furthermore, we synthesized additional
luciferase reporters fused to the CDC27 3′-UTRs, but
with mutant mir-218-2 binding sequences, called MUT1,
MUT2, and MUT1+2, respectively. We then transfected
these luciferase reporter vectors with either the wild-type
or mutant mir-218-2 binding sequences into the 293T,
U87, and U251 cell lines. We also cotransfected these cells
with mir-218-2 mimic, mimic control, or positive control
(PC) to measure luciferase activity. As is shown in Figure
4D, the mir-218-2 mimic (20 nM) decreased the luciferase
activity of the reporter vector containing the wild-type
sequences and the PC sequences. However, the mir-2182 mimic had no significant effect on the reporter vector
with the mutated binding sequences. Next, we assessed
whether re-expression of CDC27 could reverse the effects

To evaluate whether mir-218-2 promotes glioma

male BALB/c nude mice and weighed the tumors 30 days
after injection (Figure 6A and 6B). mir-218-2-inhibited

TGFβ signaling pathways. In addition, mir-218-2 may increase migration and invasion by modulating adhesion and junction proteins.

and a proliferation marker, Ki67, was conducted and
measured in tumor xenograft tissues (Figure 6C–6F),
which revealed significantly higher levels of CDC27,
but lower levels of Ki67, in the mir-218-2-inhibited
group. These in vivo observations suggest that mir-218-2
depletion decreases glioma carcinogenesis by regulating
CDC27 expression.

Emerging evidence has implicated a synergistic effect
between intronic miRNA and its host gene. Different from
the significant inhibitory effect on tumors for SLIT2 [31],
SLIT3 remains controversial in the progression versus
suppression due to tumor species specificity. Other recent
studies have validated mir-218-2 and its host gene SLIT3
as being concomitantly downregulated in thyroid cancer.
Meanwhile, the synergistic inhibitory effects of mir218-2 and SLIT3 have been detected in thyroid cancer
cell invasion and proliferation [12]. However, another
study found that slit was widely expressed in human
hepatocellular carcinomas [32]. In addition, the latest
research shows that SLIT3 is expressed at significantly
higher levels in higher grade gliomas than in lower
grade gliomas; therefore, SLIT3 appears promising in
comparison with more traditional IHC markers currently
used to diagnose glioma, particularly for the mesenchymal
subtype of glioma [33]. These findings are consistent with
our observations of SLIT3 expression in glioma cells.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that mir-218-2, together with
its host gene SLIT3, contribute to glioma tumorigenesis.
CDC27, a core subunit of APC/C, interacts with
mitotic checkpoint proteins and coactivates APC in
the ubiquitination of securin and cyclins during mitosis
[17]. Recent studies have found that securin promotes
the development of aneuploidy and shortens survival for
patients with human breast cancer. Importantly, CDC27
has been associated with securin expression and serve as
an inverse predictor for the presence of malignant cells
and shortened survival in human breast tumor cases [34].
In contrast, cyclin proteins, such as cyclin A [35], cyclin
B [36] and cyclin D1 [24, 37, 38], express aberrantly in
tumor species. The cyclin/CDK, cyclin A/CDK2, and
cyclin D/CDK4 complexes play critical roles in cell cycle
control and DNA replication. Altered activities of cyclin/
CDKs are associated with the progression of various
malignant human cancers. In yeast and animal cells,
APC/CCdh1, mediated by CDC27, targets many proteins
throughout G1, including mitotic cyclins, factors that
regulate spindle function, and sister chromatid cohesin
proteins. In fact, lower expression CDC27 was found
to be associated with poorer response to radiotherapy
in squamous cell cervix carcinoma and Triple Negative
Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells because of the important
role of CDC27/APC in the mitotic regulatory pathway
[39]. In this study, CDC27 expression, regulated by mir218-2, was negatively correlated with the expression of
most cyclins and securin, except for cyclin B2, causing
stagnation in the G0/G1 phase. Meanwhile, CDC27
enhanced the chemosensitivity of glioma cells to β-lap. On
the other hand, CDC27 is an inducing factor for TGF-β,
which modulates APC/C activity via phosphorylation,
thereby resulting in the induction of genes responsive for
growth inhibition and tumor suppression [40]. The TGF-β/
Smads pathways are classical pathways in both cell cycle
arrest and the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT).

DISCUSSION
Despite significant improvements in the diagnosis
and treatment of glioma the dismal 5-year survival rate
for patients has not changed substantially, underscoring
the importance for identifying and characterizing the
molecular mechanisms of glioma tumorigenesis. The
accumulated evidence has shown that in addition to
executing various biological functions intronic sequences,
such as miRNAs, also harbor functional regulatory
elements [6]. Furthermore, other studies have reported
that mir-218 represses the malignant transformation
and progression of glioma [14] as well as other cancers,
including melanoma and oral cavity squamous cell
carcinomas [28, 29]. Two genes encode mature mir-218,
namely mir-218-1 and mir-218-2, and are correspondingly
located within introns of SLIT2 and SLIT3 [12]. However,
the expression of mir-218-1 and mir-218-2, as well as their
respective host genes, has not been well characterized for
most histological types of glioma. In this study, we have
uncovered several novel findings. First, we demonstrated
that mir-218-2 is highly overexpressed in glioma tissue
specimens and cell lines (Figure 1). Second, as shown
in Figure 2, mir-218-2 was found to promote glioma
invasion and migration by modulating adherent junctions,
focal adhesions, and the actin cytoskeleton. Third, the upregulation of mir-218-2 was found to induce proliferation
in vitro (Figure 3) and in vivo (Figure 6). Moreover, mir218-2 knockdown not only triggered an anti-proliferative
effect in tumor growth, invasion, and migration but also
enhanced chemosensitivity to β-lap, partly by inducing
ROS generation. Finally, CDC27 was found to be a target
gene for mir-218-2 (Figure 4), which modified the APC/
C-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin proteins and securin
(Figure 5). Up-regulation of mir-218-2 significantly
decreased CDC27 levels in glioma cells, whereas downregulation of this miRNA or restoring CDC27 expression
induced the opposite effect. Collectively, these results
may help improve our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the oncogenic effects of mir-218-2 and should
impact our view of the role miRNAs have as potential
therapeutic targets.
Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis
that mir-218 is an important suppressor for glioma [13,
14, 30]. As was confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis,
compared to the mir-218-2-3p, mir-218-1-3p was
minimally expressed in glioma cell lines, indicating that
mir-218-1 plays a dominant role in tumor suppression.

It is well known that EMT is a complicated process
where epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell
adhesion, thus obtaining migratory and invasive properties
closely related to molecules like E-cadherin and βcatenin.
However, little is known regarding how these molecules
change and operate in key processes. In this study, we
hypothesize that TGF-β signaling pathways may interact
with E-cadherin/β-catenin and FAK/ vinculin via CDC27APC/C, although the exact molecular mechanisms are not
fully understood.
In conclusion, we found that mir-218-2 is highly
overexpressed in gliomas, and that it facilitates the growth,
invasion, and migration, as well as drug susceptibility of
glioma cells. In addition, mir-218-2 promoted glioma
carcinogenesis in vivo. Moreover, mir-218-2 exerted its
function though the APC ubiquitin–proteasome pathway
by directly targeting CDC27. Our data highlights the
potential role of mir-218-2 in the prognostic evaluation
and therapeutic application for glioma.

sample was assayed in triplicate. CDC27 specific primers:
(F) 5′-AGAAGTTATGTTGTGGCCTTGG-3′ and (R)
5′-AGGTACAACAGCAGCATGGTTC-3′.

Western blotting
Cells were washed in PBS and then collected in
RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) for
protein quantification followed by addition of sample
buffer and heat denaturation at 95°C for 10 min. Protein
lysates were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels and transferred to
Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, USA).
Membranes was blocked with 1% BSA supplement
with 0.05% Tween-20, followed by incubation with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After washing with
TBST, PVDF membranes were incubated with HRPconjugated antibody for 1 h at 37°C. Immune complexes
were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence
ECL kit (Merck Millipore, USA), and detected using
ChemiScope3400 Mini (Clinx Science Instruments,
China). The following primary antibodies were used:
anti-CDC27 antibody (Abcam, USA), anti-cyclinA
antibody (Abcam, USA), anti-cyclinB1 antibody
(Abcam, USA), anti-cyclin B2 antibody (Abcam, USA),
anti-cyclin D1 antibody (Abcam, USA), anti-securin
antibody (Abcam, USA), anti-E-Cadherin antibody
(Abcam, USA), anti-beta Catenin antibody (Abcam,
USA), anti-beta Catenin (phospho T41 + S45) antibody
(Abcam, USA), anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma, USA),
anti-FAK antibody (RD, USA), anti-FAK (phospho
S732) antibody (Abcam, USA), and anti-GAPDH
(1:1000, Boster Biotechnology, China).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and tissue specimens
The human glia cell line (HA-1800), and glioma
cell lines U251, U87, and U118 were purchased from
the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cell lines were maintained at
37°C in 5% CO2 with DMEM medium (HyClone, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco).
A total of 19 cases of glioma (eight cases of Grade I-II
and eleven cases of III-IV), which had been clinically
and histologically diagnosed at the Affiliated Hospital of
Binzhou Medical University between 2011 and 2015, were
obtained with previous patient consent and approval from
the Institutional Research Ethics Committee. Five normal
brain tissue samples were obtained from individuals who
suffered intracerebral hemorrhage but were confirmed
to be free of any detectable pathological conditions. All
tissue specimens were stored at −80°C.

Lentivirus construct and plasmid transfection
Lentiviruses encoding hsa-mir-218-2 and the
anti-sense to has-mir-218-2 (mir-218-2 Inhibit) with a
sequence of CGCGGTGCTTGACAGAACCATG and
their respective scrambled control were obtained from
Genechem Inc (Shanghai, China). For re-expression
of CDC27, cDNA strands corresponding to the CDC27
sequence were synthesized and cloned into the XhoI
and KpnI sites of pDsRed2-Neomycin (GeneChem,
Shanghai, China); a scrambled vector was used as
control. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used, following the
manufacturer’s protocol.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
MiRNA expression was determined by collecting
total RNA from 70% to 90% confluent cell cultures
and normal or malignant human brain tissues with the
MiRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The following protocol
was performed as recommended in the miScript II RT
Kit and miScript SYBR® Green PCR Kit (Qiagen).
MiScript primers specific for mature miRNA were hsamir-218-1-3p and hsa-mir-218-2-3p (Qiagen). All samples
were normalized to small mRNA U6 (Qiagen) and the
fold change expression of miRNAs relative to U6 was
determined by the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. Each PCR reaction
contained 12.5 μl of Fast Start Universal SYBR Green
Master Mix, 2 μl of cDNA, 2.5 μl of each of 10 mM
primer, and 5.5 μl ddH2O in a total volume of 25μl. Each

Cell invasion and migration assays
The invasive and migration behaviors of indicated
cells were analyzed by transwell chamber (Corning
Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA) assays with or
without coated matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA, USA). Cells were detached from culture plates in
the absence of TrypLE™ (Gibco) and resuspended at a
6314

Cell viability assays

density of 3 × 105/ml in DMEM. The lower chamber of
the transwell was filled with 500 μl DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS. After 24-h incubation, the cells and gel
on the upper surface were scraped using a cotton swab,
whereas the cells that had invaded to the lower surface of
the insert were fixed, stained with crystal violet, washed
with 33% acetic acid and measured for the OD value at
570 nm, which was used as an indicator of cell number.

Cell viability was detected with the CCK8 (Dojindo,
Japan) assay. Following cultures to the log phase, cells
were seeded on a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well).
After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with various
concentrations of β-lap and cultured for another 24 h.
Subsequently, 10 μL of the CCK-8 solution was added
to each well and measured with a microtiter plate reader
at 450 nm after incubation for 3 h. For measurement of
cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner, cells were
cultured with 4-μM β-lap, and cell viability was measured
at 0 h, 4 h, 8 h and 12 h, respectively.

Wound-healing analysis
Scratch wound assays were performed to assess the
motility of indicated cells. A confluent monolayer of cells
was seeded in 6-well plates. Creation of a linear scratch
wound was performed using a pipette tip. After removal
of cellular debris, cultures were incubated for the indicated
times, and the progression of migration was observed and
photographed. Image J software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland) was used to determine the
distance between the wound edges.

Measurement of ROS
Intracellular accumulation of ROS was determined
using the Cell MeterTM Fluorimetric Intracellular Total
ROS Activity Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, USA). Cells were
collected by centrifugation, treated with 4 μM β-lap for 1
h, resuspended in DMEM medium without red phenol and
incubated with ROS BriteTM 670 for 30 min. Fluorescence
was measured with a flow cytometer (Beckman, CA, USA).

Cell proliferation assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates in DMEM
medium containing 10% FBS at a density of 5 × 104
cells/mL and incubated for 24 h. A 10 μL volume of the
CCK-8 solution (Dojindo, Japan) was then added to each
well and cells were cultured for another 4 h. The optical
density measured at 450 nm was used as an indicator of
cell viability. The plate was then read in a spectrometer
at 450 nm to determine the absorbance of each well. Cell
proliferation was evaluated every 24 h over a period of 5
days. Each assay was repeated three independent times in
triplicate.

Dual-luciferase reporter assays
293T, U87, and U251 cells were plated at 1 ×
105 cells per well in 24-well plates. The following day,
cells were cotransfected with 250 ng of pMIR-REPORT
Luciferase vector, including the 3′-UTR of CDC27
(with either wild-type or 2 mutant mir-218-2 binding
sites), pmirGLO control vector, and pmirGLO with
509-inhibitor as PC, mir-218-2 mimic or mimic control at
a final concentration of 20 nM using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After transfection for 24 and 48 h, firefly and renilla
luciferase activities were performed using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay (Promega, USA). Normalized
data were calculated as the quotient of renilla/firefly
luciferase activities. Each experiment was repeated for at
least three times in each group.

Cell cycle assays
Cells were starved 12 h for synchronization
followed by re-stimulation with 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells
were fixed with 75% ethanol and treated according to
the Cell Cycle Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA, USA). Cells were then sorted by a FACS Caliber
flow cytometer (Beckman, CA, USA). The cell phase
distribution was analyzed with Flowjo software (Treestar
Inc., USA).

In vivo tumor xenografts assays
Animal protocols were approved by the Ethical
Committee of Binzhou Medicai University. Approximately
(4–6) × 106 U87 cells, infected or uninfected, were injected
subcutaneously into the flank of male BALB/c nude mice
(age 4 weeks), respectively. Each group contained five
mice. Thirty days later, mice were sacrificed and tumors
were excised and weighed.

Soft agar colony formation assays
The soft agar assay was performed, to evaluate
anchorage-independent growth. Cells were resuspended
in 0.5 mL 0.6% low-melting-point agarose (Promega,
USA) with complete culture medium, and layered on
top of 0.5 mL 1.2% low melting agarose in 6-well plates
(5,000 cells/well). The plates were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2 weeks. Colonies
containing at least 50 cells were counted. All experiments
were repeated three times.

Rhodamine phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, USA) diluted in 1%
bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Micrographs
were obtained using a DMI 3000 confocal microscope
(Leica). Tissue sections were routinely processed and
subjected to antigen retrieval. After blocking and further
incubation with primary antibody at 4°C overnight, the
reaction was developed using a Super Vision two-step kit
(Boster, China) followed by DBA (Boster, China) staining.
Harris hematoxylin (Boster, China) was used for nuclear
staining at room temperature. Images were acquired
with a DBI 4000B microscope (Leica) with an Imaging
LAS V4.0. The following primary antibodies were used:
anti-CDC27 antibody (Proteintech, USA) and anti-Ki67
antibody (Abcam, USA). Staining was measured and
quantified by Image-Pro Plus (USA).
