ABSTRACT
Three-dimensional (3D) culture, which can simulate in vivo microenvironments,
has been increasingly used to study tumor cell biology. Since most preclinical antiglioma drug tests still rely on conventional 2D cell culture, we established a collagen
scaffold for 3D glioma cell culture. Glioma cells cultured on these 3D scaffolds
showed greater degree of dedifferentiation and quiescence than cells in 2D culture.
3D-cultured cells also exhibited enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic alkylating
agents, with a much higher proportion of glioma stem cells and upregulation of
O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Importantly, tumor cells in 3D
culture showed chemotherapy resistance patterns similar to those observed in glioma
patients. Our results suggest that 3D collagen scaffolds are promising in vitro research
platforms for screening new anti-glioma therapeutics.

architecture, extracellular matrix (ECM) components
and cell interactions [6]. This leads to large deviations
in drug sensitivities between in vitro tests and in vivo
clinical evaluations [3]. Therefore, building new in vitro
anti-glioma drug research models will be crucial for the
development of effective anti-glioma therapeutics [7].
To address these challenges, several 3D tumor cell
culture techniques have been reported [8–11]. Cancer
cells cultured in 3D structures may be superior for use in
in vitro trials due in part to increased cell-cell and cellECM interaction. 3D scaffolds may better simulate native
tumor microenvironment ECM [12] and provide more
accurate drug efficacy analyses [13]. The principal ECM
component identified in the normal brain is hyaluronan
(HA) [14], therefore brain tissue engineering studies,
including those for malignant tumors [15], frequently
choose HA as a matrix-mimetic platform. However,
glioma ECM composition is critically different from that

INTRODUCTION
Malignant glioma is the most common and deadly
type of brain tumor [1]. In the past decade, even with
improvements in surgical, radiation and chemotherapeutic
methods to treat glioblastoma multiform (GBM), the most
malignant glioma (World Health Organization [WHO]
grade IV), the median patient survival has only increased
from 10 months to 14 months [2]. New, more effective
treatment regimens are urgently needed. Most drugs failed
to achieve satisfactory effects in a number of recent multicenter anti-glioma Phase II clinical trials. It has been
shown that traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture
systems perform poorly as preclinical drug discovery
tools, and are not suitable models for investigating solid
tumors [3–5]. Current 2D cell culture systems provide
neither good glioma stem cell (GSC) enrichment nor
biomimetic microenvironments, including appropriate

compared to 2D culture, in 3D culture the proportion of
cells in G1/G0 phase increased from 58.05 ± 7.76% to
69.37 ± 4.20%, and cells in S and G2/M phases decreased
from 28.51 ± 3.85% to 17.45 ± 3.02% and 13.44 ± 3.96%
to 13.18 ± 1.82%, respectively (Figure 2B). This suggests
that cells grown in 3D scaffold culture accumulated in
G0/G1 phase with concomitant reduction in S phase.
We also used flow cytometry to determine whether 3D
culture altered U87 cell proliferation, apoptosis and
differentiation. The proportion of Ki-67+, caspase-3+ and
cleaved PARP+ U87 cells was 58.69%, 0.93% and 0.60%,
respectively, in 3D culture and 96.84%, 0.52% and 0.15%,
respectively, in 2D culture. On the other hand, the mean
proportion of GFAP+ U87 cells was 98.31 ± 1.01% in 2D
monolayers versus 86.03 ± 3.64% in 3D scaffolds (Figure
2C). A similar effect was seen on primary glioma cells
(Supplementary Figure S2). The results showed that 3D
culture induced glioma cell dedifferentiation and decreased
proliferation but did not impact apoptosis. As determined
by flow cytometry, slower cell growth in 3D scaffolds
could be attributed to both decreased proliferation and
increased quiescence. Similar apoptosis rates between 2D
and 3D cultures indicate that our collagen scaffolds exhibit
good biocompatibility.

of normal brain. Glioma tissues contain large amounts
of fibrillary collagens [16], which are important ligands
for activation of signal transduction networks required
for glioma malignancy [17]. In this study, we proposed
that collagen is a superior biomaterial for in vitro glioma
studies. We developed a porous collagen scaffold and
constructed a 3D glioma culture model using this scaffold.
To evaluate anti-glioma drug efficacies and to clarify
different drug-resistance mechanisms, we performed in
vitro trials using our 3D collagen scaffolds. Morphology,
proliferation, growth kinetics, and chemosensitivity of
glioma cells in 3D collagen scaffolds were remarkably
different from their 2D monolayer counterparts. Relatively
slow cell growth in the 3D model was attributed to
decreased proliferation and increased quiescence.
Dedifferentiation and increased drug resistance were also
observed in 3D-cultured glioma cells. Drug resistance was
attributed to MGMT upregulation and enhanced glioma
cell stemness.

RESULTS
Morphology and structure of glioma cells in 3D
culture

Response to chemotherapeutic drugs

We observed changes in cell morphology in 3D
collagen scaffold cultures as compared to 2D cultures.
After seven days in culture, U87 and primary glioma
cells were fixed, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for
H&E staining or dried for SEM imaging. Glioma cells in
3D collagen scaffolds (Figure 1B) but not in 2D culture
plates (Figure 1A) displayed a high degree of similarity
with primary tumor tissue. SEM showed that U87 cells in
2D culture were fusiform, flat and epithelioid (Figure 1C).
Glioma cells in 3D scaffolds grew as small, round or ovoid
cells appeared stereoscopic and formed a multi-layer
structure (Figure 1D). Primary tumor cells cultured in
3D collagen scaffolds (Figure 1E) were morphologically
similar to glioma cells in human tumor tissues (Figure 1F),
and grew in complex formations with cilia or microvilli on
their surface. Furthermore, with increased culture duration
(3 to 10 days), cells constituted 3D structures throughout
the deep scaffold (Supplementary Figure S1A–S1D).
These results suggest that 3D collagen scaffolds more
effectively mimic the in vivo microenvironment than 2D
cultures.

DDP is the most commonly used cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agent, and CCNU and TMZ are the
most common alkylating drugs clinical administered
to glioma patients. U87 and primary glioma cells in 3D
culture demonstrated greater resistance to all three drugs
than cells in monolayer culture. Cells were more resistant
to CCNU and TMZ than DDP. For U87 cells, the halfmaximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in 3D and 2D
cultures were: DDP: 34.39 and 11.94 μM, CCNU: 326.70
and 7.78 μM, TMZ: 702.20 and 123.30 μM, respectively
(Figure 3A–3C). For primary glioma cells, IC50s in 3D
vs. 2D cultures were: DDP: 10.63 and 3.73 μM; CCNU:
264.20 and 14.71 μM; TMZ: 1032.00 and 163.10 μM
(Figure 3D–3F). These data suggest that glioma cells
in 3D culturing are more chemotherapeutic resistant as
compared with cells in 2D culturing.

Changes in the expression of chemotherapy
resistance-related genes
We investigated levels of multiple drug resistancerelated genes in U87 and primary glioma cells, including
genes related to drug efflux (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2,
ABCC4, ABCG2, ATM), DNA damage repair (MGMT)
and stemness (CD133). We found that both CD133 and
MGMT were upregulated in U87 and primary glioma
cells in 3D culture (Figure 4A–4D). Importantly, U87
is MGMT-negative in traditional 2D culture [18]. These
results suggest that drug resistance in cells grown in

Growth profile of glioma cells in 3D culture
We compared proliferation and cell cycle stage in
glioma cells cultured in 3D collagen scaffolds with cells
in 2D monolayer cultures. CCK8 assay results showed that
U87 cells grew more slowly in 3D scaffolds than in 2D
monolayer cultures (Figure 2A). Statistically significant
differences were observed after five days in culture. As

Stemness in 3D-cultured glioma cells

3D collagen scaffolds could be attributed to increased
DNA damage repair and stemness. The enhanced
stemness phenotype agreed with the observed increases
in the number of cells in G0/G1 phase and cellular
dedifferentiation in 3D culture.

GSC-like properties were analyzed in U87 cells
by immunofluorescent (IF) staining, FACS, qRT-PCR,
Western blotting and colony/sphere-forming tests. CD133

IF staining was observed in 3D, but not 2D, culture slides
(Figure 5A). The mean ratio of CD133+ cells to total cells
was 1.39 ± 1.96% in 2D cultures vs. 7.48 ± 1.13% in 3D
cultures (Figure 5B). Flow cytometry showed that 0.29%
and 4.34% of GSCs were CD133+ in 2D and 3D cultures,
respectively (Figure 5C). The proportion of GSC-like
U87 cells grown in collagen scaffolds was 15-fold higher
than that in monolayer culture. The stemness factors,
Nanog and Sox2, were upregulated by 4.77 ± 0.51-fold
and 15.25 ± 3.11-fold, respectively, in 3D cultured U87
cells (Figure 5D–5E). We also found that 3D culture
increased U87 cell colony and spheroid formation (Figure
5F–5G) by approximately two-fold compared with cells
in 2D culture. Enhanced stemness-associated properties
were also observed in primary glioma cells in 3D culture
(Supplementary Figure S3). These data indicate that
3D collagen scaffolds promote glioma cell stemness,
activation of GSCs-associated factors and self-renewal.

was investigated according to individual drug peak plasma
concentrations (PPCs) as measured in human blood. In
2D culture, the mean inhibition rates of DDP, CCNU and
TMZ were 80.85 ± 1.17%, 72.27 ± 4.30% and 72.19 ±
2.83% in U87 cells, and 52.03 ± 1.12%, 93.89 ± 2.48%
and 76.95 ± 2.08% in primary glioma cells. In 3D culture,
the rates were 13.53 ± 11.77%, 6.78 ± 5.73% and 27.60 ±
11.11% in U87 cells, and 28.18 ± 4.26%, 28.65 ± 9.13%
and 45.04 ± 5.51% in primary glioma cells (Figure 6).
The chemosensitivity of glioma cells in 3D culture more
closely resembled clinical objective response rates for all
drugs as compared to 2D cultures.

DISCUSSION
Due in part to the complexity of the tumor
microenvironment, traditional 2D culture of tumor cells
often does not accurately mimic the in vivo properties.
Previous studies in 3D glioma culture systems commonly
used gels, such as matrigel [19] or hydrogel [20]. Although
these systems exhibit good biocompatibility, cell viability
tests, such as MTT, CCK8 or Alamar Blue assay, are
difficult to perform in gels. Thus, tumor studies in gels are
usually focused on invasion, motility or specific signaling

pathway activation. Compared with gel, the 3D scaffold
system is suitable for cancer screening of therapeutics.
A previous glioma drug study was performed using a
chitosan-hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold [15], which
induced weak drug resistance corresponding to increased
ABCG2 expression. However, MGMT overexpression
is a main reason for glioma drug resistance in clinical

cases [21], and collagen, not hyaluronic acid, is the main
ECM component in glioma tissues. Use of appropriate
ECM components is therefore critically important in
monitoring tumor cell responses to exogenous cues such
as growth factor activation or chemotherapy. In this study,
we developed a porous 3D scaffold mainly containing
collagens I and IV, the primary ECM components in

glioma [22]. These scaffolds have several advantages,
including high porosity, a large surface area-to-volume
ratio for cellular attachment, tunable pore diameter, low
cost and high reproducibility of culture condition. Using
this scaffold, we created a 3D glioma culture model with
features different from those of conventional in vitro 2D
culture systems. Increased chemotherapy resistance was
observed in 3D culture tumor cells as a result of increased
stemness and upregulation of cell self-rehabilitation
protein, MGMT. To our knowledge, this is the first
observation that changing culture dimensions and ECM
components induces MGMT overexpression by glioma
cells.
The mechanism for enhancement of glioma cell
stemness in 3D culture is not yet clear. GSC-enriched
microenvironments are complex, but frequently include
a variety of cytokine changes, hypoxia and poor local
nutritional conditions [23]. 3D culture may provide regions
of hypoxia and improve cell-cell communications [24, 25].
Hypoxia can reduce cell sensitivity to growth signals and
cause the accumulation of GSCs in G0 phase of the cell
cycle [26, 27], especially in 3D organoid systems [28].
This may explain increased number of quiescent cells in
3D scaffold cultures.
Drug resistance in glioma is associated with drug
efflux, metabolism, cancer stem cells, DNA damage
repair, and miRNA activity [29, 30]. Previous studies have
described the relationship between cancer cell stemness
and tumor chemosensitivity. For example, TMZ may fail
to inhibit GSC self-renewal [31] via activation of the
EGFR and SHH pathways [32] or various ATP binding
cassette transporters [33]. Additionally, GSC quiescence
and long life span also enhance drug resistance [34, 35].

Consistent with clinical results, we found that MGMT
was upregulated in glioma cells in 3D collagen scaffold
cultures. High MGMT activity in glioma promotes
resistance to alkylating agent chemotherapeutics [36–38],
as shown by increased resistance of our 3D-cultured
glioma cells to CCNU and TMZ. Notably, U87 cells in 2D
culture are MGMT-negative, but MGMT was upregulated
in cells grown on the 3D scaffolds. Sox2 activation was
also found in glioma cells in 3D culture, and MGMT
activation may be induced by Sox2 [39]. Therefore, 3D
collagen scaffold culture provides glioma cells with a
microenvironment conducive to drug resistance, at least in
part through GSC enrichment and enhanced DNA damage
repair.
The reported clinical response rates of glioma
patient to chemotherapeutics DDP, CCNU and TMZ
were 10% [40], 12~21% [41, 42] and 7~40% [43–45],
respectively. Our data suggest that treatment of glioma
cells with these drugs in 3D culture more closely
simulated clinical response rates as compared to cells
in 2D culture.
In conclusion, we developed an in vitro 3D glioma
cell culture system using collagen scaffolds that provide
cell attachment structures. Glioma cells grown in these
3D cultures exhibited morphological and biochemical
differences compared with cells grown in conventional
2D cultures, including enhanced chemotherapy resistance,
GSC enrichment and MGMT overexpression. Importantly,
tumor cells in 3D culture showed similar chemotherapy
resistance patterns as those observed in glioma patients.
Our results thus suggest that 3D collagen scaffolds are
promising in vitro research platforms for screening new
anti-glioma therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

air-dried overnight, sputter-coated with gold and imaged
(KYKY EM-3200). Glioma samples were quickly frozen
in liquid nitrogen after surgical resection until use and
fragmented immediately after removal from liquid
nitrogen. A specimen with a diameter of about 1.5 mm
was chosen for fixation.

Preparation of 3D collagen scaffolds
Collagen scaffolds were fabricated from collagen
membranes, made from bovine collagen of spongy
bone, obtained from the Institute of Combined Injury of
the Third Military Medical University. Briefly, collagen
membranes were immersed in 0.5 M acetic acid for 8 h
at 4°C, mixed in a blender for 15 min and neutralized by
4 M NaOH. The homogeneous solution was dialyzed in
deionized water for 5 d and lyophilized. We produced
collagen scaffolds with 50 μm average pore sizes.
Scaffolds were cut into 1×5×5 mm pellets and crosslinked by 1 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)
carbodiimide and 0.6 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide. After
crosslinking, pellets were lyophilized again, sterilized by
60Co and stored at ambient temperature.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell viabilities in both 2D monolayers and 3D
scaffolds were measured indirectly by the Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK8) (Beyotime Technologies, C0038). Briefly,
the original medium was replaced with 100 μl medium
containing 10% CCK-8. The reaction was incubated at
37°C for 1.5 h and the solution was moved to a new 96well plate for spectrophotometric measurement at 450
nm using a microplate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo
Electron Corporation). Four parallel replicates of each
sample were analyzed daily. DMEM containing 10%
CCK-8 was used as a control.

Primary glioma samples and cells
Tissue collection and analysis were approved by the
Ethics Committee of Southwest Hospital, Third Military
Medical University, and written informed consent was
obtained from the participants. Human glioma tissues
used for primary cell culture were obtained from one
GBM patient who underwent neurosurgical operation
in December 2009. The diagnosis was verified by
pathological analysis and classified according to the WHO
classification standard. Primary glioma cell isolation and
culture was performed in our lab as described previously
[46, 47]. The GBM cell line, U87, was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection.

Flow cytometry
For cell cycle analysis, glioma cells (5 days) were
washed twice with PBS and fixed in 75% cold ethanol
at 4°C overnight. Fixed cells were washed with cooled
PBS and stained using the cell cycle assay kit (Bestbio,
BB-4104). The experiment was repeated three times.
For proliferation and apoptosis analysis, Caspase-3, Ki67 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
were labeled with conjugated monoclonal antibodies (BD
Biosciences) after U87 cell permeabilization. For CD133
expression analysis, cells were blocked by FcR blocking
reagent (Miltenyi, 130-059-901) and then incubated with
CD133/1-APC (Miltenyi, 130-090-826) at 4°C for 30
min. Cells were washed twice and resuspended with cold
PBS. 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, 51-68981E) was added to
cell suspensions to identify dead cells. Mouse IgG1-APC
(Miltenyi, 130-092-214) was used as the isotype control.
All analyses were performed on a FACS Calibur analyzer
(BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

2D and 3D glioma cell culture
For 2D culture, cells were seeded onto 60 mm
dishes and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2.
For 3D scaffold culture, following immersion in 10%
FBS-supplemented medium for 12h at 37°C, collagen
scaffolds were loaded with cell suspensions (200,00 cells
in 20 μL medium per scaffold) and maintained at 37°C
for 4 h. Then, scaffolds with seeded cells were transferred
to 6-well cell culture plates containing 3 ml medium;
medium was changed every 2 days.

Immunofluorescent staining
Samples were fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde, cut into 15 μm sections and affixed
to slides. Slides were blocked with 10% BSA for 1 h,
incubated with anti-human CD133 (Boster, BA3992)
overnight at 4°C, then washed three times in PBS and
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen, A21244) in the dark for 1 h at room
temperature. Finally, slides were stained with 0.1%
4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize
cell nuclei, washed twice with PBS and examined via
confocal microscopy (Leica LSM780). Image analysis was
performed using ZEN software. Four random microscopy

Cell morphology analysis
Cell morphology was observed via Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM). Specimens (7 days) were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into for 5
μm sections and H&E stained. For SEM analysis, scaffold
or glioma samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
overnight, dehydrated in an ethanol gradient (70–100%),

linked goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Thermo, 31210) or
goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Thermo, 31431) was used
as appropriate. Results were visualized using SuperSignal
West Dura chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Chemosensitivity assay
Dose–responses for chemotherapeutics were
evaluated in 2D and 3D cultures. Glioma cells (5×103
cells/well) were seeded on either monolayer or scaffold
in a 96-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h before
treatment. Then, culture medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing various concentrations of the
anticancer drugs, temozolomide (TMZ) (Meilun, 8562293-1), lomustine (CCNU) (Meilun, 13010-47-4) and
cisplatin (DDP) (Sigma, 479306), for IC50 analysis.
To better compare with clinical outcomes, anti-glioma
inhibition rates were investigated according to drug PPCs
of human blood in 2D and 3D culture. PPCs of the three
tested drugs were TMZ: 258.0 μM, CCNU: 14.0 μM
and DDP: 12.8 μM [48–50]. After 24 h, drug-containing
medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were
incubated for 48 h. After treatment, chemosensitivity
was determined using the CCK8 assay. Percent antiglioma inhibition rates were calculated as the average cell
viability in each drug group as compared to the average
viability in the untreated group. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Colony and sphere formation assays
For colony formation assays, U87 cells from
different culture models were plated (200 cells/well) in
complete medium in a 24-well plate, and were allowed to
form colonies for 12 days. Colonies were fixed with acetic
acid and methanol (1:3) for 15 min and stained with 0.5%
crystal violet for 30 min. Colonies containing more than 50
cells were counted manually. For sphere formation assays,
cells were seeded in serum-free neural stem cell medium
(DMEM/F12 medium containing 20 ng/ml recombinant
human epidermal growth factor, 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast
growth factor and 2% B27) (200 cells/well) into a 96-well
plate. Spheroids were counted manually by inverted phase
contrast microscopy after 10 days.
