Abstract
Induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by TGF-b1 requires Ras signaling. We recently
identiﬁed the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 (PRDM1) as a downstream effector of the NF-kB, RelB/Bcl-2/Rasdriven pathway that promotes breast cancer cell migration. As the RelB/Blimp-1 pathway similarly required Ras
signaling activation, we tested whether Blimp-1 plays a role in TGF-b1–mediated EMT. Here, TGF-b1 treatment of
untransformed NMuMG mammary epithelial and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was shown to induce Blimp-1
expression, which promoted an EMT signature and cell migration. TGFB1 and BLIMP1 RNA levels were correlated
in patient breast tumors. BLIMP1 gene transcription was activated by TGF-b1 via a c-Raf (RAF1) to AP-1 pathway.
Blimp-1 induced expression of the EMT master regulator Snail (SNAI1) via repressing BMP-5, which inhibited
Snail expression upon TGF-b1 treatment. Interestingly, a similar cascade was observed during postnatal mouse
mammary gland development. RelB expression was detected early in pregnancy followed progressively by Blimp-1
and then Snail; whereas, BMP-5 levels were high in nulliparous and regressing glands. Finally, lower BMP5 RNA
levels were detected in patient breast tumors versus normal tissues, and correlated with cancer recurrence. Thus,
the Ras effector Blimp-1 plays an essential role in TGF-b1–induced EMT via repression of BMP-5 in breast cancer.

Introduction
Aberrant constitutive expression of NF-kB subunits,
reported in more than 90% of breast cancers (1, 2) and multiple
other malignancies, plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis (3, 4).
Notably, the RelB NF-kB subunit is more highly expressed in
more aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)a-negative breast
tumors versus ERa-positive ones, and promotes their invasive
phenotype (5). Similarly, nuclear RelB expression in prostate
cancer correlates directly with Gleason score (6) and plays a
radioprotective role in aggressive prostate cancer cells (7). In
breast cancer cells, RelB enhances migration and invasion via
induction of the BCL2 gene (5). The resulting Bcl-2 protein
recruits Ras to the mitochondria, where it is activated (8).

The zinc-ﬁnger B-lymphocyte–induced maturation protein
(Blimp-1) was identiﬁed as a pivotal downstream mediator
of the migratory phenotype regulated by RelB and Ras (8).
Blimp-1, which was not previously known to be expressed in
breast cancer, reduced ERa expression by directly repressing
ERa (ESR1) gene transcription (8). Consistently, higher BLIMP1
RNA expression was detected in ERa negative breast tumors.
Blimp-1 was originally identiﬁed as a silencer of IFNB gene
transcription (9), and subsequently as a master regulator
essential for the differentiation of B and T lymphocytes (10,
11). Blimp-1 also plays crucial roles in early embryonic development, including the speciﬁcation and migration of primordial germ cells (12, 13). Consistently, we have shown that
Blimp-1 promotes breast cancer cell migration (8).
TGF-b, which suppresses growth of normal cells, functions
as a tumor promoter in the presence of active Ras signaling.
TGF-b1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and promotes the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells
that are signaling via a Ras to Erk cascade (14). TGF-b1
treatment of the ERa-negative untransformed NMuMG mouse
mammary epithelial line (15, 16) or of MDA-MB-231 human
breast cancer cells promotes EMT as judged by enhanced cell
migration and wound closure in vitro (17), and metastasis to
bone (18) and lung (19) in mouse models. As Blimp-1 is induced
downstream of Ras signaling, we hypothesized a role for this
master regulator in TGF-b1–mediated EMT. Here, we elucidate
a new EMT pathway mediated by Blimp-1 that leads to Snail
induction via the repression of bone morphogenetic protein 5
(BMP-5) expression, which has been previously implicated in

Blimp-1 Mediates TGF-b1–Induced EMT via Repression of BMP-5

certain features of TGF-b–induced EMT in renal epithelial cells
(20). Consistently, lower BMP5 RNA levels are detected in
breast tumors versus normal tissues, and correlate with disease recurrence in patients, suggesting the clinical relevance of
this pathway.

Results

ChIP assay
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay for AP-1
binding was conducted using Hs578T cells as previously
described (8), see Supplementary Materials. The Blimp-1 ChIP
assay for the BMP5 promoter was conducted using a
pcDNA4/Blimp1-V5-tag expression vector and the EZ-ChIP
Kit (Millipore Corporation; Supplementary Materials).

Blimp-1 is required for TGF-b1–induced EMT
Incubation of MDA-MB-231 or NMuMG cells with TGF-b1
resulted in robust increases in BLIMP1 RNA and Blimp-1
protein levels (Fig. 1A). Using 2 different Blimp-1 siRNAs to
knockdown Blimp-1 levels in MDA-MB-231 cells, the normally
observed induction of ﬁbronectin caused by TGF-b1 treatment
was attenuated (17) and the decrease in basal E-cadherin levels
was prevented (Fig. 1B). MDA-MB-231 cells consist of 2 subpopulations with different levels of E-cadherin, 1 negative and
1 positive (22); the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin is not
detectable (23). No signiﬁcant increase in the high basal levels
of vimentin was noted. TGF-b1 treatment of NMuMG cells has
been shown to lead to EMT, as judged by the upregulation of
mesenchymal markers ﬁbronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin
(15). Knockdown of Blimp-1 overrode the characteristic upregulation of all 3 mesenchymal makers by TGF-b1 (Fig. 1C).
Notably, ectopic expression of Blimp-1 largely rescued the
effects of Blimp-1 knockdown in these cells, conﬁrming the
speciﬁcity of the Blimp-1 siRNA (Fig. 1D). These results were
recapitulated in another ERa-negative breast cancer line
Hs578T using both knockdown and dominant negative strategies (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Another measure of EMT is increased cell migration (16).
TGF-b1 treatment led to more rapid wound closure by both
MDA-MB-231 and NMuMG cells. Blimp-1 knockdown reduced
the basal level of wound closure and prevented its acceleration
by TGF-b1 in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1E and F and Supplementary
Fig. S2) and NMuMG cells (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, ectopic
Blimp-1 expression in NMuMG cells partially rescued the
decreased migration seen upon Blimp-1 knockdown (Fig.
1G). Consistently, the acquisition of a ﬁbroblastoid phenotype
by NMuMG cells upon TGF-b1 treatment was prevented by
knockdown of Blimp-1 (Fig. 1H). Thus, TGF-b1 treatment
induces Blimp-1 expression, which is essential for the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype.
Increased TGF-b1 production has been observed in breast
carcinomas compared with normal tissues (24), and associated
with disease progression in human breast cancer (25). Using
the bc-GenExMiner database of 2,920 patients with breast
cancer, a signiﬁcant correlation was observed between TGFB1
and BLIMP1 RNA levels (r ¼ 0.35, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1I), which was
also observed when one stratiﬁed by ERa status (Supplementary Fig. S3), thus extending the clinical relevance of these
ﬁndings to human disease.

Gene expression and statistical analysis
Individual cancer datasets were downloaded from Oncomine (Compendia Bioscience), as previously described (5);
see Supplementary Data. The prognostic value of BMP5 in
recurrence of breast cancer was assessed with Kaplan–Meier
Plotter (www.kmplot.com), which used gene expression
microarray data and survival information of 2,324 patients
with breast cancer downloaded from GEO (Affymetrix
HGU133A and HGU133þ2). To compare the different conditions used in wound-healing assays, the Student t test was
conducted and a P value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Blimp-1 expression in breast cancer cells is mediated via
a c-Raf to AP-1 pathway
To address the mechanism of Blimp-1 activation, we focused
on Ras signaling, as it is implicated downstream of RelB
signaling (8) and also required for the transforming activity
of TGF-b1 (14, 26). As c-Raf is an effector of Ras-mediated
migration (27), its involvement in Blimp-1 induction was
tested. Expression of a constitutively active form of c-Raf (Raf
CA) into ERa-positive ZR-75 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells,
which contain low levels of Blimp-1, led to increased Blimp-1
levels (Fig. 2A). Conversely, a dominant negative variant of cRaf (Raf DN) prevented Blimp-1 induction by ectopic

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment conditions
ERa-negative MDA-MB-231, NMuMG and Hs578T and ERapositive MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), grown in medium
recommended by ATCC and vials frozen immediately. Fresh
vials were used approximately every 6 weeks. Cells were
conﬁrmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination using PCR
(VenorGeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Sigma). The identity of
the MDA-MB-231 line was authenticated using short tandem
repeat analysis (Genetica DNA Laboratories), which has shown
100% identity with the MDA-MB-231 cell line of ATCC. Hs578T
pRELB-shRNA (RelB shRNA) or pRELB-sense (Control) cell lines
were established as described (5) and grown in the presence of
1 mg/mL puromycin (Sigma). NMuMG and MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with 2 and 5 ng/mL TGF-b1, respectively, or with
100 ng/mL BMP-5 (R&D Systems). For both reagents, the
equivalent volume of vehicle, 4 mmol/L HCl containing 1
mg/mL BSA in PBS, was used as control. Plasmids, transfection
analysis and wound-healing assays are described in the Supplementary Materials.
RNA and immunoblot analyses
RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and real-time quantitative Q-PCR
analyses were conducted as detailed in Supplementary Data.
Whole-cell extracts (WCE) and nuclear extracts (NE) were
prepared and subjected to immunoblotting using the antibodies described in the Supplementary Materials. Protein
extracts were prepared from the 4th mammary gland of
FVB/N mice following removal of the lymph node as previously
described (21), see Supplementary Materials.

expression of RelB and its binding partner p52 (Fig. 2A).
Consistent with a c-Raf to Erk pathway downstream of RelB
and Bcl-2, we conﬁrmed the ability of RelB and Bcl-2 to activate
Erk1/2 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), and showed that
their effects on Blimp-1 induction could be abrogated with the
MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Thus, c-Raf
and Erk1/2 are important downstream effectors of the Ras
pathway leading to induction of Blimp-1 expression in breast
cancer cells.

Dimeric AP-1 factors are important mediators of transformation by the Ras/c-Raf/Erk1/2 pathway and have been implicated in TGF-b1–mediated transformation (28). AP-1 elements
have been involved in the transcriptional control of the BLIMP1
gene although different subunits were identiﬁed, suggesting
cell-type speciﬁcity (29). Following ectopic expression of RelB/
p52 or Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells, activation of c-Jun, c-Fos, Fra-1, and
Fra-2 AP-1 subunits was observed, as judged by an increase in
their levels and/or relative phosphorylation status (Fig. 2B).

shown). ChIP assays found endogenous c-Jun, c-Fos, Fra-1, and
Fra-2 protein bound to the AP-1 site in the BLIMP1 promoter
in Hs578T cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that they all contribute
to induction of BLIMP1 transcription. Thus, activation of
AP-1 signaling potently induces Blimp-1 expression in breast
cancer cells.

Figure 2. Blimp-1 is induced by the RelB/Bcl-2/c-Raf to AP-1 pathway. A,
ZR-75 and MCF-7 cells were transfected with a constitutively active c-Raf
(Raf CA) vector or with RelB þ p52 expression vectors in the presence of a
dominant negative c-Raf expression (Raf DN) vector for 48 hours. NEs
were subjected to immunoblotting. B, WCEs from MCF-7 cells
transfected with the indicated vectors for 48 hours were subjected to
immunoblotting. C, WCEs from stable-mixed populations of Hs578T
cells expressing RelB or Control shRNA were subjected to
immunoblotting. D, WCEs from NMuMG or Hs578T cells transfected for
48 hours with EV or indicated AP-1 vector were subjected to
immunoblotting.

Consistently, Blimp-1 expression was induced. Conversely,
knockdown of RelB in Hs578T cells led to decreased levels of
these same AP-1 subunits as well as of endogenous Blimp-1
expression (Fig. 2C). Cotransfection of vectors expressing c-Jun
with c-Fos, Fra-1, or Fra-2 induced BLIMP1 promoter activity
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). Expression of these AP-1 subunits
increased endogenous levels of Blimp-1 protein (Fig. 2D).
Complexes of c-Jun/Fra-2 resulted in the largest induction in
NMuMG and Hs578T cells (2.4-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively),
with the latter line transfecting with a much higher efﬁciency.
Consistently, knockdown of c-Jun and Fra-2 in MDA-MB-231
and Hs578T cells led to the most robust decreases in Blimp-1
levels (reduction of 70% with this combination of siRNAs;
Fig. 3A). Knockdown of c-Jun/c-Fos or c-Jun/Fra-1 also led to
decreased endogenous Blimp-1 levels, but to a lesser extent.
Two nearby AP-1 binding sites have been identiﬁed in the
BLIMP1 promoter in B cells (29). We focused on the 1647 bp
site as it showed more binding in an initial test (data not

TGF-b1 induces Blimp-1 via a c-Raf to AP-1 pathway
We next addressed whether increased AP-1 activity by
TGF-b1 was responsible for Blimp-1 induction. TGF-b1
treatment increased nuclear levels of c-Jun and Fra-2 in
both NMuMG and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3C). In NMuMG
cells, c-Fos and Fra-1 were downregulated, whereas they
were modestly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. The role of cJun/Fra-2 activation in TGF-b1-mediated induction of
Blimp-1 was tested. Knockdown of both c-Jun and Fra-2
greatly reduced the induction of Blimp-1 in MDA-MB-231
cells treated by TGF-b1 (Fig. 3D), which is consistent with
the partial rescue of E-cadherin expression and the decrease
in ﬁbronectin induction seen upon TGF-b1 treatment
(Fig. 3E). The remaining Blimp-1 expression may be because
of the increase in c-Fos and Fra-1 seen in these cells upon
TGF-b1 treatment (Fig. 3C). Finally, c-Raf knockdown
reduced basal Blimp-1 expression and virtually completely
prevented its induction by TGF-b1, which led to the rescue
of E-cadherin expression and the attenuation of ﬁbronectin
induction by TGF-b1 (Fig. 3F), conﬁrming the importance of
the Ras/c-Raf signaling axis. Together, we conclude that
TGF-b1 activates AP-1, thereby inducing Blimp-1 expression,
which promotes EMT.
Blimp-1 is required for the induction of Snail by TGF-b1
Blimp-1 was shown to promote EMT through the direct
repression of ERa gene expression in ERa-positive breast
cancer cells (8). However, as NMuMG and MDA-MB-231 cells
are ERa negative and its reexpression was not observed upon
Blimp-1 knockdown (data not shown), we sought to identify
the TGF-b1–induced EMT mediator downstream of Blimp-1.
Snail and Slug are 2 key transcription factors that regulate the
TGF-b-induced EMT molecular program during tumor progression (30). Blimp-1 knockdown greatly reduced the induction of Snail/SNAIL RNA and Snail protein resulting from TGFb1 treatment (Fig. 4A), whereas the induction of Slug was
unaffected (data not shown). Moreover, ectopic Blimp-1
expression was sufﬁcient to increase levels of Snail in NMuMG
and multiple breast cancer lines (Fig. 4B). Thus, Blimp-1
promotes the induction of Snail expression and its knockdown
appears to profoundly decrease Snail protein levels following
treatment with TGF-b1.
Blimp-1 repression of the BMP5 gene relieves inhibition
of Snail expression by BMP-5 and promotes EMT by
TGF-b1
We next sought to elucidate the mechanism whereby Blimp1, which is a zinc ﬁnger protein only known to repress
transcription, induces Snail expression. As Blimp-1 did not
appear to affect the canonical TGF-b1 pathway mediated by
Smad signaling (see Discussion), we hypothesized that Blimp-1

reduced the expression of an inhibitor of Snail expression.
Microarray analysis was conducted to identify genes controlled
by Blimp-1 in the MDA-MB-231 line. Cells were reverse transfected with the 2 Blimp-1 siRNAs used above for 48 hours. The
quality of RNA from 2 independent experiments was conﬁrmed
using an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit and effective Blimp-1
knockdown using Western blot analysis (data not shown). The
RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix 1.0 ST arrays, representing 28,869 human genes. Sixty eight genes were signiﬁcantly
upregulated with Blimp-1 siRNAs, which represent potential
direct Blimp-1 targets. BMP5 was found upregulated 2.75-fold
(P ¼ 5  104) with the 2 Blimp-1 siRNAs compared with
Control siRNA, which was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4C).
Interestingly, both TGF-b1 and BMP-5 belong to the TGF-b
superfamily and their signaling pathways display complex and
frequently antagonistic crosstalk during organogenesis and
tissue homeostasis (31). To conﬁrm the effects of Blimp-1 on
BMP5 expression, Blimp-1 was ectopically expressed in
NMuMG cells and led to a profound repression of Bmp5 RNA
(Fig. 4C). Importantly, TGF-b1 treatment resulted in almost
complete loss of BMP5 expression; whereas, BMP5 levels were

substantially maintained upon knockdown of Blimp-1 in
NMuMG (Fig. 4D) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4D and data
not shown). Using Transfac analysis, 4 putative Blimp-1 binding sites were identiﬁed in the BMP5 promoter (Fig. 4E). As
there are currently no commercially available Blimp-1 antibodies for ChIP analysis, V5-tagged Blimp-1 protein was
ectopically expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Blimp-1 binding
to the region-containing sites 1 and 2 was shown using 2
different V5 antibodies (Fig. 4E). Together these ﬁndings
identify BMP5 as a direct target of Blimp-1 repression.
To assess the role of BMP-5 in Snail induction by TGF-b1,
NMuMG and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with TGF-b1 or
BMP-5 alone, or the 2 in combination. Notably, addition of
recombinant BMP-5 signiﬁcantly attenuated Snail induction
by TGF-b1 and reduced the induction of ﬁbronectin in both
lines (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the loss of E-cadherin expression on
the surface of NMuMG cells in response to TGF-b1 was largely
overridden by BMP-5 (Fig. 5B) and the ﬁbroblastoid phenotype
was also substantially reversed (Fig. 5C). Finally, the acceleration of wound closure seen with TGF-b1 treatment was
abrogated with addition of BMP-5 (Figs. 5D and E). Together,

or with control IgG. The 2 BMP5 promoter regions containing putative Blimp-1 binding sites were ampliﬁed by PCR, whereas a region of the GAPDH promoter
that does not carry any Blimp-1 site was used as negative control.

the data indicate that repression of BMP-5 levels by TGF-b1
contributes to the induction of EMT.
The RelB/Blimp-1/Snail pathway is active during
mammary gland development
Previously, we detected RelB expression in the developing
mouse mammary gland and found this subunit involved in
ductal branching during pregnancy (21). As pathways used in
malignant cells are often derived from normal development,
we examined the expression of RelB and Blimp-1 in the mouse
mammary gland. For each time point during pregnancy, nuclear and WCEs were prepared from 3 individual female mice. As
seen previously, expression of RelB was detected early during
pregnancy and increased between days 10.5 and 18.5 (Fig. 6A).
During lactation and regression, RelB levels continued to

decline. Blimp-1 expression followed RelB, with amounts
increasing during late pregnancy and peaking during lactation (Fig. 6A), as judged by quantiﬁcation of the 3 samples
per time point (Fig. 6B). In comparison, Snail expression was
quite low during pregnancy and increased following Blimp-1
induction. Expression of Blimp-1 and Snail dropped precipitously during regression (Fig. 6). Thus, the relative patterns
of Blimp-1 and Snail were consistent with signaling downstream of RelB. Notably, we could detect the precursor and
mature forms of BMP-5 in nulliparous mice and during
regression. Mature BMP-5 expression decreased progressively during pregnancy until it disappeared at the latest time
point of pregnancy (P18.5) and during lactation, which is
consistent with our ﬁndings identifying BMP-5 as a target of
Blimp-1 repression and involved in Snail repression,

Breast cancer and poor prognosis are associated with
low BMP5 expression
To assess the role of BMP-5 in breast cancer, we used the
Oncomine database to evaluate their levels of BMP5 expression. The TCGA_Breast study was selected initially, as this
dataset includes a substantial number of normal breast
tissues (n ¼ 25), as well as a large number of invasive breast
carcinoma samples (n ¼ 346; Fig. 7A). BMP5 RNA was
signiﬁcantly lower in overall invasive tumors versus normal
breast tissues (see legend for individual P values). Data from
other studies that include fewer normal tissue samples
showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
Overall, when all the studies containing informative BMP5
expression levels were combined, BMP5 was identiﬁed as
one of the most downregulated genes in breast cancer
compared with normal tissue (Fig. 7B). Furthermore,

6274

numerous BMPs were found to be aberrantly downregulated
in breast cancer, whereas TGFB1 was upregulated when
compared with normal tissues (Supplemental Fig. S5C).
Finally, the prognostic value of BMP5 was assessed using
Kaplan–Meier Plotter, an online tool to correlate survival
with gene expression, based upon microarray data from
2,324 patients with breast cancer. Low BMP5 RNA levels
were signiﬁcantly correlated with lower disease-free survival (Fig. 7C), particularly in patients with ERa-negative
cancers (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
These studies elucidate a new pathway of transformation
by TGF-b1 via induction of Snail. Blimp-1 was induced by
TGF-b1 via a c-Raf/AP-1 pathway, and directly inhibited the
BMP5 gene (see scheme in Fig. 7E). The resulting decrease
in BMP-5 levels led to a derepression of Snail expression.
Thus Blimp-1 and BMP-5 are crucial intermediates between
the Ras/c-Raf/AP-1 signaling axes and the induction of

Blimp-1 Mediates TGF-b1–Induced EMT via Repression of BMP-5

Figure 6. Blimp-1/BMP5/Snail axis is active in vivo during adult mammary
gland development. A, mammary glands were harvested from 12-week
(12w)-old nulliparous mice and from mice at different days of pregnancy
(P5.5, P10.5, P18.5), lactation (L1, L7), and regression (R3). NEs were
immunoblotted for RelB, Snail and Lamin B, and WCEs for Blimp-1,
precursor (p) and mature (m) forms of BMP-5, and b-actin, respectively.  ,

b-actin as appropriate. The mean values of the multiple samples taken at
the same time points are shown.

Snail and EMT by TGF-b1 in breast epithelial and cancer
cells.
The transcriptional master regulator Snail is induced in
virtually all EMT processes and notably by TGF-b in a broad
spectrum of cell types (30). Snail expression has been
correlated with mesenchymal phenotype and metastasis of
breast cancer (32). Abnormal production of TGF-b1 in breast
cancer is associated with disease progression (25). Interrogation of microarray datasets has shown a signiﬁcant correlation between TGFB1 and BLIMP1 RNA levels in 2,920
patients with breast cancer, extending our ﬁndings to
human disease. The induction of Snail by Blimp-1 is mediated via release of repression by BMP-5, and consistently
Blimp-1 is shown here to directly bind to and repress the
BMP5 gene. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study showing
the direct binding of a transcription factor to the mammalian BMP5 promoter leading to its transcriptional regulation.
Previous studies of the BMP5 promoter identiﬁed putative
regulatory elements (i.e., GATA-1, engrailed and long-range
cis regulatory elements), but binding studies or more ﬁnetuned mapping was not conducted (33, 34). In untrans-

formed renal epithelial cells, BMP-5 expression was
decreased by TGF-b and its addition attenuated TGFb-induced EMT, as judged by levels of smooth muscle cell
actin and ZO-1 (20); although the target(s) of BMP-5 was not
elucidated in these cells. TGF-b and BMP signaling pathways
display complex (positive and negative) cross-talk during
organogenesis and homeostasis of many tissues (31). In
mammary cells, BMP-5 and TGF-b1 had antagonistic activities on Snail expression. Blimp-1 tilted the balance toward
TGF-b1-induced EMT by repressing BMP-5 expression,
which led to the derepression of Snail.
Bmp5 was identiﬁed as the gene mutated in the short-ear
mouse model, which displays various skeletal defects (35).
Interestingly, these mice also have a 2-fold increase in skin
tumor susceptibility (36). Decreased BMP-5 expression was
observed in a number of primary tumors or cancer cell lines. In
pancreatic cancers, which are typiﬁed by active Ras signaling,
low expression of BMP5 RNA was detected in 16 tumor cell
lines compared with 4 normal samples (37). BMP-5 expression was also signiﬁcantly lower in adrenocortical carcinomas and tumor cell lines compared with normal adrenal
glands (38), and in malignant schwannoma versus benign
lesions (39). We observed that BMP5 RNA is one of the most
underexpressed transcripts in breast tumors compared with
normal tissue, and its decreased expression correlated with
disease recurrence in patients with breast cancer. Reduced
BMP5 levels also correlated with more invasive tumors in
these patients. Previously, Blimp-1 was found more highly
expressed in ERa-negative versus ERa-positive breast
tumors (5). Consistently, the prognostic value of BMP-5 was
restricted to ERa-negative breast tumors, validating the
biologic relevance of this inhibitory pathway. Interestingly,
the Blimp-1/BMP-5/Snail axis appeared active in vivo during
adult mammary gland development. In contrast to BMP-5,
Blimp-1 and Snail were not expressed in nulliparous or
regressing mammary glands, and only detected during pregnancy and lactation. This suggests that after pregnancy,
Blimp-1 expression might need to be shut down in mammary tissue to reactivate BMP-5, decreasing Snail levels and
allowing the gland to go back to a resting stage.
AP-1 complexes drive the oncogenic capacity of TGF-b at
the transcriptional level (40). Here, AP-1 dimers of c-Jun and
Fra-2 were identiﬁed as critical downstream targets required
for Blimp-1 induction in response to TGF-b1. Transcriptional activation of other TGF-b–induced genes involved in
tumor progression, such as Collagen, MMP2, Laminin
a3a, and the autoinduction of TGF-b1 itself is similarly
mediated by the direct promoter binding of AP-1 complexes
(40). Interestingly, overexpression of c-Jun in MCF-7 cells
strongly promoted their migratory and invasive properties
and allowed for tumor formation independent of estrogen
(41). Fra-1 and Fra-2 were implicated in the malignant
behavior of breast cancer cells and the progression of
mammary carcinoma (8, 42).
This study identiﬁes Blimp-1 as a critical node in the
cooperation between the Ras pathway and TGF-b1 signaling
in favor of Snail expression and induction of EMT. Blimp-1
did not appear to affect the canonical TGF-b1 pathway

Figure 7. BMP5 expression is downregulated in breast cancer, and low BMP5 levels correlate with breast cancer recurrence. A, the TCGA_Breast microarray
11
dataset was accessed using the Oncomine database (www.oncomine.com) and includes normal breast tissues (1), invasive (2, P ¼ 4.55  10 ), invasive
ductal (3, P ¼ 6.98  1010), invasive lobular (4, P ¼ 2.67  1010), and invasive-mixed breast carcinomas (5, P ¼ 3.87  107). n ¼ sample number. Box
plots depict the distribution of BMP5 expression within each group. The P values were obtained using a Student t test for the comparison of BMP5 expression
between the normal breast tissue and each breast carcinoma group. B, the median BMP5 rank was assessed across 9 analyses comparing the normal tissue
group to each breast carcinoma group found in Gluck_Breast (1, invasive ductal breast carcinoma), Radvanyi_Breast (2, ductal breast carcinoma
in situ; 3, invasive ductal breast carcinoma; 4, invasive lobular breast carcinoma; 5, invasive-mixed breast carcinoma), and TCGA_Breast (6, invasive breast
carcinoma; 7, invasive ductal breast carcinoma; 8, invasive lobular breast carcinoma; 9, invasive-mixed breast carcinoma) datasets. The P value is given for the
median-ranked analysis. C and D, the Kaplan–Meier survival plots were obtained using Kaplan–Meier Plotter (www.kmplot.com) and display the probability
of relapse-free survival of 2,324 patients with breast cancer (C) or 494 patients with ERa-negative breast cancer grouped according to BMP5 median
expression (D). HR with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) and P value for the comparison of the low and high BMP5 groups, are shown on the plot. E, summary
scheme. In the presence of Ras signaling, TGF-b1 induces Snail, which promotes EMT. Here a novel mechanism of Snail induction is elucidated in mammary
epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. TGF-b1 induces Blimp-1 expression via a c-Raf/Erk/AP-1 pathway. Blimp-1 is required for TGF-b1–induced Snail
expression and repression of BMP-5. BMP-5 is an inhibitor of the induction of Snail expression by TGF-b1.

mediated by Smad signaling as its knockdown did not affect
either levels of Smad2/3 and Smad4 in the nucleus, or RNA
levels of Smad6 and Smad7 (data not shown). The antagonistic effects of BMP-5 on TGF-b1–induced EMT provide a
rationale for the prognostic value of BMP-5 observed in
patients with invasive breast cancer. Interestingly, addition
of BMP-5 did not recapitulate all the EMT marker modulations seen with Blimp-1 knockdown upon TGF-b1, suggesting that Blimp-1 regulates genes other than BMP5 and SNAIL
to promote certain features of TGF-b1–induced EMT in ERa
