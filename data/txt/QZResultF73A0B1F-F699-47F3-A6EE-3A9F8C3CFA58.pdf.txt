Abstract
Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2) is a recently
identified prominent regulator of prostate cancer growth and
metastasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
mechanistic role of CCL2 in prostate cancer growth in bone.
The present study found that CCL2 was up-regulated in
osteoblasts (3-fold by PC-3 and 2-fold by VCaP conditioned
medium) and endothelial cells (2-fold by PC-3 and VCaP
conditioned medium). Parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP) treatment of osteoblastic cells up-regulated CCL2 and
was blocked by a PTHrP antagonist, suggesting that prostate
cancer–derived PTHrP plays an important role in elevation of
osteoblast-derived CCL2. CCL2 indirectly increased blood
vessel formation in endothelial cells through vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which was up-regulated 2-fold with
administration of CCL2 in prostate cancer cells. In vivo, antiCCL2 treatment suppressed tumor growth in bone. The
decreased tumor burden was associated with decreased bone
resorption (serum TRAP5b levels were decreased by 50–60% in
anti–CCL2-treated animals from VCaP or PC-3 cell osseous
lesions) and microvessel density was decreased by 70% in
anti–CCL2-treated animals with bone lesions from VCaP cells.
These data suggest that a destructive cascade is driven by
tumor cell–derived, PTHrP-mediated induction of CCL2,
which facilitates tumor growth via enhanced osteoclastic
and endothelial cell activity in bone marrow. Taken together,
CCL2 mediates the interaction between tumor-derived factors
and host-derived chemokines acting in cooperation to
promote skeletal metastasis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1685–92]

Introduction
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) is a member of the
CC chemokine family and was recently described as facilitating
osteoclastogenesis (1, 2). Osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption
are independent steps leading to the development of skeletal
metastases and are mutually essential for prostate cancer
establishment in the bone microenvironment. CCL2 can also
directly support prostate carcinoma cell growth in vitro (3, 4). We

further showed that targeted inhibition of CCL2 effectively
suppressed prostate cancer growth in vivo and suggested that
CCL2 may enhance tumor growth through macrophage infiltration
and angiogenesis (5). Previous findings suggest that CCL2 can
directly mediate angiogenesis in endothelial cells, which express
chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), the receptor for CCL2 (6). Human
brain endothelial cells, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC), and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMVEC) were reported to express CCR2 and are able to respond
to CCL2 by forming more vessel spouts in vitro (6, 7). Conversely,
one study showed that HUVECs and HDMVECs do not express CC
chemokine receptors (8) and thus are unlikely to be regulated by
CCL2. The presence of CCR2 and its angiogenic response to CCL2
may differ in endothelial cells depending on tissue sites. In addition,
it is not clear if CCL2 can directly activate endothelial cells in the
bone marrow, which would be more relevant to angiogenesis during
bone metastasis. Interestingly, human bone marrow endothelial
(HBME) cells were found to secrete high levels of CCL2 compared
with human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and HDMVECs (4),
indicating an active role of CCL2 in the bone microenvironment.
With recent studies highlighting a role for CCL2 in supporting the
development of prostate cancer skeletal metastasis, a better
understanding of how CCL2 facilitates tumor growth in bone is
important to consider it as a novel therapeutic target for the
treatment of bone-specific disease. There seem to be two distinct
roles for CCL2 in the development and promotion of prostate
cancer: a direct effect on prostate cancer epithelial cells and an
indirect effect on cells (i.e., osteoclasts and endothelial cells) at the
metastatic site to support tumor growth. Here, we hypothesized
that elevated CCL2 in the bone microenvironment contributes to
prostate tumor growth by initiating osteoclastogenesis and
angiogenesis to create a favorable niche for prostate cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Recombinant human parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP) (1-34) and (7-34) were obtained from Bachem. CNTO 888, a human
antibody that neutralizes human CCL2, C1142, an anti-mouse CCL2
antibody, and C1322, a control antibody for C1142, were provided by
Centocor, Inc. CNTO 888 and C1142 do not cross-react with or neutralize
mouse CCL2 or human CCL2, respectively (4). Anti-human IgG from R&D
Systems was used as control antibody for CNTO 888. Human rCCL2 was
obtained from PeproTech.
Cell culture. All cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) until otherwise noted. PC-3 and LnCaP were maintained in RPMI
1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). VCaP and HBME cells were
obtained from the Rapid Autopsy Program at the University of Michigan (9).
HAECs, HBMEs, and VCaP cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10%
FBS plus 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen). HDMVECs were maintained in EGM2
(Clonetics) containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.

injection, bone marrow aspirates were collected from the tibia and analyzed for CCL2 expression by ELISA. Columns, mean (n = 8); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05. C and D,
cells were maintained and passaged as described in Materials and Methods. Confluent Saos2, HAECs, HBMEs, and HDMVECs were cocultured with conditioned
medium from confluent VCaP and PC-3 cells overnight as indicated for CCL2 measurement. C, CCL2 levels in HAEC, HBME, and HDMVEC supernatants cultured

Human osteoblastic Saos2 cells (ATCC HTB-85) were maintained in
aMEM (Invitrogen) containing 1% antibiotics and 10% FBS. Saos2 cells were
plated at 50,000/cm2 and cultured to 80% to 90% confluence. Cells were
subsequently treated with vehicle or PTHrP (10 nmol/L) for 4 h after serum
starvation. The PTHrP antagonist PTHrP(7-34) (2 Amol/L) was added
30 min ahead of PTHrP treatment as indicated. Primary mouse calvarial
cells were isolated as previously described (10). Cells were plated at 80,000
per well in 24-well plates in aMEM with 10% FBS containing 1% antibiotics.
Primary cultures at 90% confluence were used without passage and treated
with PTHrP or vehicle for 4 h.
Protein detection. Bone marrow aspirates, sera, and conditioned media
from cell culture were used for protein detection. Bone marrow aspirates
were prepared by flushing tibiae or femurs with 1 mL of saline. The number
of total cells was counted and used to normalize protein levels. Bone
marrow aspirates, sera separated from blood, and conditioned media were
aliquoted and kept at 20jC until assays were performed.
Secreted CCL2 protein levels in Saos2, PC-3, endothelial cells, or
primary cell culture medium were measured by ELISA assay system from
BD Biosciences. Values were calculated from standard curves set up for
each assay. Data were based on triplicate experiments performed

independently. Serum TRAP5b activity was measured by ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) levels in the conditioned
medium of PC-3 cells were measured using an ELISA assay system from
R&D Systems.
In vivo prostate cancer models. Five-week-old CB17 severe combined
immunodeficient mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were
used for s.c. and intratibial tumor implantation. VCaP and PC-3 cells were
cultured in T-75 flasks to 100% confluence, trypsinized, and enumerated.
Mice were sedated with 1.7% isoflurane mixed with air for s.c. and
intratibial tumor implantation. Xenograft tumors were established by s.c.
injection of 106 VCaP or PC-3 prostate cancer cells in 200 AL of growth
factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) as previously described (11).
Animals were sacrificed after 4 wk. There were no significant body weight
differences in the animals with or without s.c. tumors at the time of
sacrifice. For intratibial tumor injection, a 27-gauge needle was used to
bore a hole in the marrow cavity through the tibial plateau into the left
tibia as described previously (5). A 28-gauge Hamilton syringe was used to
inject 5  105 cells in a 10 AL volume into the marrow cavity. Animals
were sacrificed after 8 wk. Tibias were removed, placed in 10%

formaldehyde for 24 h, and then transferred to 70% ethanol. All animal
studies were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the
Use and Care of Animals.
Treatment with anti-CCL2 (C1142). Before intratibial injection, mice
were pretreated with 2 mg/kg anti-mouse CCL2 (C1142). Control mice were
treated with either 2 mg/kg isotype control antibody (C1322) or PBS.
Following intratibial injection with PC-3 or VCaP prostate cancer cells as
described above, mice continued treatment twice weekly until the end of
the experiment.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Xenograft tumors were harvested and placed in fresh 10% formalin. Tibiae were decalcified in 10%
EDTA before paraffin embedding. Specimens were sectioned (5 Am) and
stained with either H&E, trichrome (to highlight bone), tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP; to identify osteoclasts; Acid Phosphatase
Leukocyte kit, Sigma), or immunohistochemistry performed for von
Willebrand factor (vWF; NeoMarkers). Standard indirect immunoperoxidase
procedures were used for immunohistochemistry using the AEC Cell and
Tissue staining system (R&D Systems), with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma)
used for counterstaining.
For microvessel density (MVD) analysis, after vWF staining, four random
areas per tumor section were selected. Any single or cluster of positively
stained endothelial cells that was clearly separated from adjacent microvessels was considered as one countable microvessel. The average MVD was
determined for each specimen.
Endothelial sprout network formation assay. Growth factor–reduced
Matrigel was placed in eight-well chamber slides and polymerized at 37jC
for 30 min. Eight thousand (8  103) endothelial cells were added to the top
of the Matrigel in each well. After 24-h incubation at 37jC, the slides were
fixed, stained with Hema3 STAT PACK (Protocol), and analyzed by
enumerating the sprouts under a light microscope.
Quantitative PCR assay. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells
using Tri reagent (Sigma) and 1 Ag total RNA was reverse transcribed in a
20 AL reaction volume containing random hexamers with a reverse
transcription assay system (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative reverse

transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700
with a ready-to-use mix of primers and FAM-labeled probe assay system
(Applied Biosystems). Data were calculated using the standard curve
method and expressed as a ratio to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reference.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test for independent analysis was
applied to evaluate differences using the GraphPad InStat software program
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). The value P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. In vitro assays were repeated a minimum of two times with
similar results. For in vivo assays, n indicates the number of independent
samples from different mice.

Results
Prostate tumors elevate CCL2 expression in bone marrow,
osteoblasts, and endothelial cells. To determine the ability of a
primary tumor to alter the bone microenvironment as a
premetastatic event, PC-3 and VCaP cell xenografts were implanted
s.c. and allowed to develop for 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, bone marrow
aspirates were collected from the tibiae and analyzed for CCL2
expression. The presence of PC-3 and VCaP cell xenografts
significantly increased the levels of CCL2 f2-fold in the bone
marrow compared with control animals (Fig. 1A). In separate
experiments, s.c. injection of PTHrP also significantly up-regulated
CCL2 in the bone marrow (Fig. 1B) and serum (Supplementary
Fig. S1), which is consistent with the hypothesis that PTHrP,
secreted from primary tumors, mediates up-regulation of CCL2
in the bone marrow. Previously, we showed that CCL2 is expressed
at high levels by bone marrow endothelial cells (4). Here, we
measured the CCL2 levels in vitro when endothelial cells were
cultured with prostate cancer cell conditioned medium. The
conditioned medium from prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, VCaP,

(2 Amol/L), was added 30 min before PTHrP(1-34)
treatment. Primary mouse osteoblasts (B) were

or LnCaP) increased the levels of CCL2 produced by endothelial
cells [bone marrow endothelial cells (HBME), aortic endothelial
cells (HAEC), and dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMVEC); Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2]. A significant increase
of CCL2 was also found in human osteoblastic (Saos2) cells
cultured with conditioned medium from prostate cancer cell lines
PC-3 (3-fold) and VCaP (2-fold), both of which secrete high levels of
PTHrP. Conditioned medium from the low PTHrP-secreting
prostate cancer cell line, LnCaP, failed to stimulate CCL2 secretion
from Saos2 cells (Fig. 1D). Further, stimulation of primary
osteoblasts and Saos2 cells but not endothelial cells (HAEC and
HBME) with PTHrP (10 nmol/L) increased secretion of CCL2 by
2.5-fold (Fig. 2). To confirm that the increase in CCL2 was due to
PTHrP, PTHrP(7-34) was used as an antagonist to suppress PTHrP
signaling. PTHrP(7-34) competes with PTHrP for binding to its
receptor but does not activate cyclic AMP and hence blocks
signaling (12). PTHrP(7-34) suppressed the PTHrP-induced CCL2

increase in osteoblasts, whereas it had no effect on endothelial
cells. This suggests that tumor cell–derived PTHrP increases CCL2
production by osteoblasts.
Antibody to CCL2 reduces tumor burden and MVD. To
determine the role of CCL2 in prostate cancer metastatic bone
establishment and growth, systemic inhibition of CCL2 was
accomplished using a neutralizing antibody that targets mouse
CCL2 (C1142). Mice were inoculated with either PC-3 or VCaP
prostate cancer cells. VCaP cells were originally isolated from a
vertebral metastatic lesion obtained via the University of Michigan
Rapid Autopsy Program (9). PC-3 cells are osteolytic, androgen
receptor negative, and androgen independent, whereas VCaP cells
express a wild-type androgen receptor and are androgen sensitive.
Both PC-3 and VCaP cells are known to express the CCL2 receptor
CCR2 (4). Mice were injected with PC-3 or VCaP cells by intratibial
injection and bone lesions were monitored weekly using radiographic imaging. PC-3 cells established visible osteolytic lesions by

week 6 and VCaP cells established a mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic
lesion by week 10.
Tibias were harvested and examined via immunohistochemical
analysis (Fig. 3). Overall tumor burden was significantly decreased
in tibias of mice receiving C1142 (anti-mouse CCL2) antibody
compared with control antibody (C1322). Bone destruction was
decreased, as observed by trichrome staining for mineralized bone
matrix, in animals receiving C1142 (VCaP: Fig. 3A). Additionally,
inhibition of CCL2 attenuated TRAP-positive osteoclast staining,
suggesting an inhibition of osteoclast activity (VCaP: Fig. 3A; PC-3:
Fig. 3B). Interestingly, mice inoculated with VCaP cells failed to
develop obvious osteolytic lesions when treated with the anti-CCL2
antibody. Analysis of serum markers of osteoclast activity revealed
a significant decrease in TRAP5b serum levels in animals receiving
anti-mouse CCL2 antibody compared with controls (Fig. 3C and
D). Immunostaining for vWF in tibial sections of mice that had
received intratibial injections of VCaP tumor cells revealed
decreased MVD in animals receiving anti-mouse CCL2 antibody
compared with controls (Fig. 4).
Proangiogenic effect of CCL2. It has been reported that some
human endothelial cells express the receptor for CCL2 (CCR2) and
respond to CCL2 (6), but it is not clear whether HBMEs respond to
CCL2. This is particularly relevant because bone marrow
endothelial cells are the most abundant endothelial cell type in
skeletal lesions. Our study showed that CCL2 stimulated tumor
cells to produce a proangiogenic factor(s) instead of directly
stimulating bone marrow endothelial cells (Fig. 5). Conditioned
medium from CCL2-treated PC-3 cells significantly increased
sprout formation in HBMEs, whereas pretreating PC-3 cells with
anti-CCL2 antibody abolished this effect (Fig. 5A and B). CCL2
itself failed to stimulate capillary tube formation of HBMEs when
added directly (Supplementary Fig. S3). CNTO 888 alone, the
antibody to human CCL2, had no effect on capillary tube
formation. CCL2 increased VEGF-A mRNA levels from PC-3 cells
after 4 and 6 hours (Fig. 5C). The stimulation of VEGF-A mRNA in
PC-3 cells was specifically mediated by CCL2 because it could be
blocked with pretreatment of the neutralizing antibody to the
tumor cells. The increase of VEGF-A protein in CCL2-stimulated
PC-3 cells was confirmed by ELISA (Fig. 5D), resulting in a 60%
increase of VEGF-A after serum-starved PC-3 cells were incubated
with CCL2 for 24 hours.
Taken together, our model proposes an explanation of how CCL2
facilitates prostate cancer growth in bone (Fig. 6). PTHrP released
from prostate cancer stimulates osteoblastic CCL2 expression
(Figs. 1 and 2), which causes increased osteoclastic bone resorption
(Fig. 3; refs. 1, 2), and in turn facilitates prostate cancer tumor
localization in bone (4, 5). Meanwhile, CCL2 binds to its receptor
on prostate cancer cells and stimulates tumor cells to release the
proangiogenic factor VEGF-A (Fig. 5). VEGF-A enhances the
formation of blood vessels to support further tumor growth (Figs.
4 and 5). Thus, CCL2 plays a key role in the destructive cascade,
which favors tumor growth via activation of tumor cells, bone
resorption, and angiogenesis.

calcium released from the bone matrix during resorption
subsequently support tumor growth in bone. Here, we present
data that show the importance of the chemokine CCL2 in
developing prostate cancer metastatic bone lesions using a s.c.
and an intratibial model of prostate cancer. S.c. tumor implantation induced elevation of CCL2 in the bone marrow compartment
before tumor metastasis in vivo. CCL2 is released from osteoblasts
and bone marrow endothelial cells endogenously and is further
induced by tumor cell–derived factors. In osteoblasts, CCL2 was
stimulated in response to PTHrP. Metastatic prostate carcinoma in
bone secretes high levels of PTHrP that are important in the
establishment of prostate cancer in the bone microenvironment
(13–16). Tumor-derived PTHrP is known to up-regulate receptor
activator of nuclear factor-nB ligand, an essential factor in

Discussion
Prostate cancer characteristically forms osteoblastic lesions
when it metastasizes to bone. It is becoming clear that osteoclast
activation is an essential component of prostate cancer skeletal
metastases, although the mechanism, timing, and relationship to
the osteoblastic component remain unclear. Growth factors and

osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, CCL2 has been shown to directly
stimulate the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and favors
osteoclastogenesis by facilitating the fusion of osteoclast precursor
cells (1–4). It has been shown that PTH regulates CCL2 expression
in bone through osteoblasts (2). PTHrP, which acts on the same
receptor (PTHR1) as parathyroid hormone, was found here to
regulate osteoblastic expression of CCL2. The stimulation of CCL2
by PTHrP in osteoblasts and the high level of CCL2 secreted by
bone marrow endothelial cells could activate osteoclasts and
enhance bone resorption to favor tumor cell localization.
It was reported that CCL2 released from endothelial cells and
osteoblasts mediates prostate cancer–induced bone resorption
(17). An in vitro system used in that study showed that PC-3
prostate cancer cell conditioned medium induced bone resorption
in human bone marrow mononuclear cells, and bone resorption
was inhibited with CCL2 neutralizing antibodies. The present study
applied in vivo experiments that targeted CCL2 with a neutralizing
antibody and elucidated mechanisms for the CCL2 effect on
tumorigenesis. Significantly decreased bone resorption and tumor
burden were found with CCL2 neutralizing antibody treatments.
PC-3 cells are known to form highly lytic lesions compared with
VCaP cells that form a mixture of osteolytic and osteoblastic
lesions. It is interesting that the anti-CCL2 neutralizing antibody
partially reduced PC-3 tumor growth and TRAP-positive osteoclast
activity and almost completely inhibited osteoclast activation and
establishment of VCaP tumors. This may suggest that osteolysis is

an important early event in the establishment of prostate cancer in
the bone compartment. The purely lytic PC-3 cells may retain the
ability to establish bone lesions with anti-CCL2 challenge, whereas
anti-CCL2 completely inhibited the ability of VCaP cells to
establish bone tumors. The decreased tumor growth was
accompanied by a decrease in TRAP5b serum levels, supporting
the inhibition of osteoclast activity by inhibiting CCL2.
In addition, systemic inhibition of CCL2 with a neutralizing
antibody was found to inhibit the growth and establishment of
prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment in association
with suppression of angiogenesis. Whether CCL2 directly stimulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells is controversial (6, 18–21).
Different tissue-derived endothelial cells may respond distinctively
to CCL2. It has been reported that HUVECs and HDMVEC do not
express receptors for CCL2 nor do they respond to CCL2 (8).
However, another study reported that HUVECs express receptors
for CCL2 and respond to CCL2 (6). We tested several endothelial
cells, including HBMEs, HAECs, and HDMVECs, and did not find
CCR2, the primary receptor for CCL2 (data not shown), nor did
they respond to CCL2. So it is unlikely that CCL2 exerts direct
endotheliotropic effects in these cells. Furthermore, we did not see
any effect of CCL2 alone on angiogenesis in HBMEs. However, the
absence of evidence to support direct effects of CCL2 on
endothelial cells does not diminish the important role of CCL2 in
angiogenesis during tumor growth. CCL2 was found to stimulate
the expression of VEGF-A in tumor cells in vitro and conditioned

increased osteoclastic bone resorption to facilitate prostate
cancer tumor growth in bone. Meanwhile, CCL2 binds
to its receptor on prostate tumor cells and stimulates the
proangiogenic factor VEGF-A release from tumor cells.
VEGF-A can further support tumor growth with enhanced
neo-blood vessel formation. Thus, CCL2 plays a key role
in the destructive cascade, which favors tumor growth
via activation of tumor cells, bone resorption, and
angiogenesis.

medium from tumor cells treated with CCL2 potently induced
angiogenesis of HBMEs. The stimulation of VEGF-A expression by
CCL2 has been reported in several cell types, including endothelial
cells (22) and vascular smooth muscle cells (23). Animals with
intratibial tumor cell inoculation and treated with neutralizing
antibody for CCL2 had decreased blood vessel density in bone
lesions. Consistent with these findings, the correlation of CCL2
expression with MVD and tumor invasion has been shown in breast
carcinomas (24), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (25), and
gastric carcinomas (26).
Besides stimulating VEGF-A release from tumor cells to facilitate
angiogenesis, CCL2 may act as an indirect inflammation-associated
inducer of angiogenesis through activation of macrophage
infiltration (5, 26–30). In addition, CCL2 could stimulate angiogenesis through enhanced osteoclastogenesis, which results in
release of bone matrix-bound angiogenic factors, such as plateletderived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1, FGF-2, and
transforming growth factor-h (31). Both mechanisms could
contribute to the neo-blood vessel formation during the develop-

ment of bone lesions from prostate carcinomas. Taken together
with the fact that CCL2 can also contribute to tumor progression
through direct activation of cell adhesion and motility in prostate
cancer cells (32), targeting CCL2 provides a promising therapeutic
strategy for prostate cancer skeletal metastasis.
