Abstract
Breast cancers with estrogen receptor a (ERa) expression are often more differentiated histologically than
ERa-negative tumors, but the reasons for this difference are poorly understood. One possible explanation is that
transcriptional cofactors associated with ERa determine the expression of genes which promote a more
differentiated phenotype. In this study, we identify one such cofactor as coactivator-associated arginine
methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a unique coactivator of ERa that can simultaneously block cell proliferation
and induce differentiation through global regulation of ERa-regulated genes. CARM1 was evidenced as an ERa
coactivator in cell-based assays, gene expression microarrays, and mouse xenograft models. In human breast
tumors, CARM1 expression positively correlated with ERa levels in ER-positive tumors but was inversely
correlated with tumor grade. Our findings suggest that coexpression of CARM1 and ERa may provide a better
biomarker of well-differentiated breast cancer. Furthermore, our findings define an important functional role of
this histone arginine methyltransferase in reprogramming ERa-regulated cellular processes, implicating CARM1
as a putative epigenetic target in ER-positive breast cancers. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2118–28. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
In normal breast tissue, estrogen receptor a (ERa) regulates
growth and development of the mammary gland by regulating
the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. This
balance is deregulated in cancer. Enhanced ERa proliferative
action contributes to the initiation and progression of breast
cancer (1) by promoting cell-cycle progression, in particular Sphase entry (2, 3). Microarray analyses using breast cancer cell
lines have revealed that a majority of ERa target genes are
involved in metabolism and cell-cycle regulation (4–6). ERa is
expressed in nearly 70% of breast cancers. Interestingly, ERapositive tumors are more histologically well-differentiated (7).
ERa decreases in high-grade tumors (8), and its presence
serves as a hallmark of differentiation and predictor of low
aggressiveness and favorable disease-free survival (9, 10). The

protective effect of ERa raises the possibility that ERa functions to regulate both proliferation and differentiation in
breast cancer cells, albeit with the balance tilted toward
proliferation. Cell proliferation and differentiation are 2
mutually exclusive processes. Forced differentiation of primary tumors with therapeutic compounds can inhibit proliferation (11). Differentiation therapy such as all-trans
retinoic acid was successfully used in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, this strategy is not widely applied
to breast carcinomas because breast tumors are more heterogeneous. Moreover, how ERa regulates the balance of proliferation and differentiation is not well understood.
ERa regulates transcription through recruitment of multiple
cofactors (12). Although ERa coactivators share the common
feature of activating ERa in transcriptional assays, to date, no
ERa coactivator has been reported to promote differentiation
in breast cancer cells. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) was originally identified as a steroid
receptor coactivator which activates transcription of ERa
target genes (13, 14). Furthermore, loss of CARM1 in the mouse
embryo leads to abrogation of the estrogen response and
reduced expression of some ER target genes (15), highlighting
the significance of CARM1 in ER-regulated processes. CARM1
is a multifunctional protein engaged in a variety of cellular
processes including gene expression (16), coupling of transcription and mRNA processing (17), regulating protein stability (18), and tissue development (15). However, the function of
CARM1 in regulating cell differentiation or proliferation is
contradictory and seems to be context dependent. CARM1
is required for differentiation of adipocytes (19), myocytes (20),

CARM1 Regulates ERa-Dependent Cellular Processes

pulmonary epithelial cells (21), and early thymocyte progenitor
cells (22). In contrast, CARM1 was implicated in cancer cell
proliferation and was shown to regulate the expression of E2F1
and cyclin E1, factors promoting cell-cycle progression (16, 23).
Thus, functions of CARM1 in ERa-dependent breast cancer
require further elucidation.
Here we report an extensive study of the biological function
of CARM1 in ERa-regulated processes in breast cancer cells,
using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture maintenance and construction
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and used within 6 months. MCF7-Tet-onshCARM1 was generated by 2 steps: First, we synthesized
shRNA-encoding oligo DNA "CGGCGAGATCCAGCGGCAC"
targeting human CARM1 and cloned the sequence into
pLVTHM plasmid (24). MCF7 cells (ATCC HTB-22) were
sequentially infected with the lenti-KRAB and pLVTHMCARM1 shRNA vectors, followed by selection of single clones
by Western blotting. MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 was generated by
cotransfecting pTRE-tight CARM1 plasmid with pBabe-puromycin vectors at a ratio of 10:1 into MCF7-Tet-on cells
(Clontech cat #630918, generous gift of Elaine Alarid), followed
by selection with puromycin. MCF7-CARM1 has been
described previously (25). MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) or
ZR-75 (ATCC CRL-1500) cells were infected with retrovirus
derived from pLNCX (Clontech), pLNCX-CARM1, and pSIRENQ-shCARM1 vectors to obtain pooled clones. The shRNAencoding oligo DNA "CAGCGTCCTCATCCAGTTC" targeting
human CARM1 was cloned into pSIREN-Q (Clontech) vector.
All cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
seeded in phenol red–free media with 5% of stripped FBS for
experiments.
Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays of
human breast tumors
All primary invasive breast tumors used in this study were
obtained from the Manitoba Breast Tumor Bank [MBTB;
Cancer Care Manitoba and University of Manitoba (http://
www.umanitoba.ca/institutes/manitoba_institute_cell_biology/MBTB/Index4.htm)]. The MBTB operates with approval
from the Research Ethics Board of the Faculty of Medicine,
University of Manitoba. Tissue collection and selection of
samples for constructing tissue microarrays (TMA) have been
reported before (26, 27). Although 450 cases were represented
on the original ER-positive TMAs, due to exhaustion of tumor
cores from previous use of the TMAs, or incomplete data for
some cases, the number (n) of tumors analyzed for some of the
markers was less than 450. Immunohistochemistry scores
(IHC scores) derive from assessment of both staining intensity
(scale: 0, 1, 2, 3) and percentage of positive cancer cells (0%–
100%). These 2 scores were multiplied to generate an IHC or
H-score with a range of 0 to 300 as previously described (27).
Only nuclear staining was scored. Briefly, serial sections
(5 mm) of the TMAs were stained with anti-CARM1 antibodies,
using an automated tissue immunostainer (Discovery Staining

Module; Ventana Medical Systems). The dilution of the primary CARM1 antibody (Ab) applied initially to the slides was
1:150, incubated for 1 hour at 42 C on the Ventana Discovery
Staining module, using CC1 buffer and the Mild and Standard
protocols for Antigen Retrieval (AR). The VIEW DAB kit and
reagents from Ventana Medical Systems were used. Slides
were viewed and scored using standard light microscopy.
Additional assays and methods
Cell growth assays, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR),
cell-cycle profiling, CARM1 Ab characterization, mouse xenograft experiments, and microarray gene expression analyses
are described in Supplementary Methods and Materials. The
microarray GEO numbers are GSE26454 and GSE26259.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA and ANOVA single-factor analysis was
applied and a value of P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically
significant.

Results
Overexpression of CARM1 in MCF7 breast cancer cell
line inhibits estrogen-dependent cell proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth and stimulates the
expression of CDK inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1
MCF7 breast cancer cells stably overexpressing CARM1,
MCF7-CARM1, were generated (25). MCF7-CARM1 grows at a
slower rate than parental cells carrying empty vector (MCF7vector) as measured by MTT assays (Fig. 1A). The altered
growth rate was not due to the superphysiologic amounts of
CARM1 in MCF7-CARM1, because compared with MCF7vector controls, MCF7-CARM1 cells have only a 2-fold increase
in CARM1 expression (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the growth
phenotype, the expression of the CDK inhibitors p21cip1 and
p27kip1 was elevated in MCF7-CARM1 treated with 17betaestradiol (E2) (Fig. 1B). Also the expression of p21cip1 and
p27kip1 was stimulated by E2 in a time-dependent manner in
MCF7-CARM1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1) but not in parental
MCF7 cells, suggesting that ERa and CARM1 are involved in
regulating their expression. The effect of CARM1 on anchorage-independent cell growth was determined using soft-agar
assays. E2 stimulates colony formation of MCF7-vector cells;
in contrast, no colonies were formed in soft agar with MCF7CARM1 (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that overexpressing
CARM1 in MCF7 may inhibit anchorage-independent growth.
In contrast to MCF7, no growth effects were detected by
overexpressing or knocking down CARM1 in MDA-MB-231,
an ERa-negative breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1D and E).
Consistent with it being ERa negative, the growth rate of
MDA-MB-231 was E2 independent (Fig. 1D). Similarly, overexpressing CARM1 exhibits no growth effect on MDA-MB-468,
another ERa-negative breast cancer cell line (Supplementary
Fig. 2), supporting the notion that the growth inhibitory effect
of CARM1 in MCF7 is ERa dependent. The growth inhibitory
effect of CARM1 was further validated in another ERa-positive
breast cancer cell line ZR-75 (Supplementary Fig. 3). p21cip1
has been reported to induce both cell cycle arrest and cell

differentiation in various carcinomas (28, 29). The findings
that p21cip1 expression is increased by E2 in the presence of
exogenous CARM1 (Supplementary Fig. 1) raises the possibility that CARM1 may inhibit breast cancer growth by modulating key ERa target genes involved in cell-cycle control and
differentiation.
CARM1 decreases estrogen-dependent breast cancer
cell growth and S-phase entry
To eliminate the possibility that the growth effects of
CARM1 in MCF7-CARM1 cells could be attributed to additional changes during retroviral integration events, we generated 2 inducible MCF7 stable cell lines: one overexpresses
CARM1 (MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1) and the other expresses
CARM1 shRNA (MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1) under the control
of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. These stable cell lines
serve as gain-of-function and loss-of-function cell culture
models for studying the effects of CARM1 in estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth. Cells were preincubated with
doxycycline (Dox) for 4 days to induce or knockdown CARM1
expression, followed by E2 treatment for 24 hours. With either
cell line, E2 alone has no significant effect on CARM1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2A and B). Dox
could increase CARM1 expression in MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1
cells by 2-fold (Fig. 2A) and reduce CARM1 to greater than 90%
in MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1 cells (Fig. 2B). E2 has no additional
effect on CARM1 expression compared with Dox alone when

both are present. The 2 cell lines were employed to measure
cell growth by MTT assays under 4 treatment conditions:
vehicle, E2, Dox, or combination of Dox and E2 for 4 time
points (24, 48, 72, and 96 hours). As expected, E2 treatment
significantly increases MCF7 cell growth starting from day 2 (P
value <0.001; Fig. 2C). Overexpression of CARM1 by Dox
treatment alone decreased MCF7 cell growth (Fig. 2C). Statistical analysis of 3 independent experiments suggested that
overexpression of CARM1 by Dox treatment significantly
repressed E2-induced cell growth in 2 individual clones, clone
7 (Fig. 2C) and clone 13 (Supplementary Fig. 4). This is in
contrast to the nonstatistically significant effect of Dox upon
E2-induced cell growth in MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1 cells (P >
0.05; Fig. 2D) and a CARM1 stable knockdown MCF7 (MCF7shCARM1) cell line expressing shRNA targeting a different
sequence of human CARM1 (Supplementary Fig. 5, P ¼ 0.04).
The main proliferative action of E2 in breast cancer is to
promote cell-cycle progression during G1/S transition (3).
Since CARM1 can induce expression of p21cip1 and p27Kip1,
which are negative regulators of the cell cycle, and inhibit E2dependent growth, we determined whether CARM1 would
interfere with E2-induced cell cycle progression. MCF7-Teton-CARM1 cells were preincubated with Dox for 4 days,
followed by E2 treatment for 24 hours. Fluorescence-activated
cell-sorting analysis of MCF7-tet-on-CARM1, using propidium
iodide labeling, showed that E2-induced S-phase entry was
inhibited by overexpressing CARM1 (Fig. 2E). This result was

Although E2 and E2 þ Dox both increased S-phase entry as
compared with that of the vehicle (P value <0.001 and 0.0015,
respectively), results from 3 independent experiments showed
that the percentage of S-phase entry induced by Dox þ E2 was
significantly decreased compared with E2 treatment alone
(P ¼ 0.0013), indicating that overexpression of CARM1
decreased E2 induction of S-phase entry. In contrast, in
MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1, Dox þ E2 treatment displayed no
difference in S-phase entry compared with E2 alone and both
treatment groups induced S-phase entry compared with the
vehicle treatment (P ¼ 0.0014). In either MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1
or MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1 cells, Dox alone had no significant
effect on S-phase entry (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that
overexpression of CARM1 can inhibit E2-stimulated cell
growth through modulating cell cycle, while loss of CARM1
could not further accelerate E2-stimulated growth within
4 days of treatment.

Changes of cell morphology and differentiation marker
expression by increasing CARM1 level in MCF7 cells
In addition to the growth inhibitory effects of CARM1, we
noticed that MCF7 cells stably overexpressing CARM1 displayed a distinct cell morphology from that of MCF7-vector
cells (Fig. 3A) and exhibited increased cell adhesion
(requires longer trypsin treatment time). Next we investigated desmoplakin 1 (DSP1) expression, a known differentiation marker of epithelial cells that plays an essential role
in maintaining cell adhesion and differentiation (30, 31), and
a CARM1 target gene identified in this study. Three independent experiments showed that E2 significantly
decreased DSP1 mRNA, which was reversed by overexpressing CARM1 in MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 cells (Fig. 3B). In
addition, induction of 2 additional differentiation markers,
GATA-3 and E-cadherin, by overexpressing CARM1 was
observed in MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 (Fig. 3C) by Western
blotting. These data suggested that growth inhibitory

CARM1 levels in MCF7 cells modulate the ERa gene
signature
Since CARM1 inhibits E2-dependent growth of MCF7 cells
and induces a morphology change, we determined the global
effect of CARM1 on E2-dependent ERa gene signature by
microarray analyses of CARM1 gain-of-function and loss-offunction cell lines treated with vehicle or E2. MCF7-inducible
cells were treated under 4 conditions: DMSO, Dox, E2, and E2
plus Dox. The gene signature as calculated by fold change was
normalized to vehicle control (Fig. 4A). Microarray analysis of
MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 reveals that E2 upregulated expression
of 313 genes and downregulated 157 genes (P < 0.05, fold
change 1.6). Overexpression of CARM1 drastically altered
E2-regulated gene signatures. Approximately 16% of E2induced genes including cell-cycle regulators (e.g., c-Myc;
Fig. 4B) were inhibited. The most profound effect of CARM1
overexpression on E2-dependent signature was to relieve the
repression of approximately 56% of E2-repressed genes
(Fig. 4C; P < 0.05, fold change 0.6 compared with vehicle).
To our knowledge, CARM1 is the only coactivator which
affects global expression of E2-repressed genes. Interestingly,
gene ontology (GO) of the affected genes suggested that most
E2-repressed, CARM1-activated genes are involved in cell
differentiation and development (Fig. 4C). The ability of
CARM1 both to inhibit E2-dependent growth and S-phase
entry and to modulate E2-dependent genes involved in cell-

cycle progression, cell differentiation, and development supports a role of CARM1 in modulating the programming of E2dependent cellular processes (i.e., regulating the balance
between cell differentiation and proliferation).
Since CARM1 has putative effects on ERa-dependent proliferation and differentiation, we applied qRT-PCR to validate
the effect of CARM1 overexpression on 6 differentially
expressed genes identified by microarray. p21cip1 and p27kip1
are known to inhibit breast cancer growth (32). Cyclin G2 is an
ERa target gene and a negative regulator of cell cycle (33).
Among genes involved in cell differentiation, GATA-3 is an ERa
target gene and prodifferentiation marker of breast cancer (8,
34). MAZ is a transcriptional factor (35), and KRTAP10.12 is a
potential prodifferentiation marker. As shown in Figure 4D, E2
alone significantly decreased cyclin G2 and KRTAP10.12 mRNA
but not p21cip, p27kip1, MAZ, and GATA-3 mRNA after 4-hour
treatment. However, overexpression of CARM1 relieved E2
repression of cyclin G2 and KRTAP10.12 and significantly
induced p21cip1, p27kip1, MAZ, and GATA-3 regardless of E2
(Fig. 4D) at mRNA level. Consistently, the protein levels of
GATA-3, E-cadherin (Fig. 3C), and p21cip1 and p27kip1 (Fig. 1B)
were also increased by CARM1 overexpression and E2 treatment. These results validate our microarray data and reinforce
the hypothesis that CARM1 may antagonize the proliferative
action of estrogen in breast cancer cells by activating multiple
cell-cycle–negative regulators and prodifferentiation genes. It
is worth noting that p21cip1 induction requires both CARM1
overexpression and E2 treatment. In contrast, overexpressing
CARM1 alone is sufficient to induce genes such as p27kip1,

CARM1 Regulates ERa-Dependent Cellular Processes

Figure 4. Overexpression of CARM1 modulates E2-dependent gene signature. A, the ratios of normalized intensities for Dox, E2, or Dox þ E2-treated samples
versus that of samples treated with control vehicle (Dox vs. DMSO, E2 vs. DMSO, and DOX þ E2 vs. DMSO) were used to show the activation or repression.
Heat map of gene expression calculated as fold changes compared with vehicle indicated that CARM1-induced genes (þDox) are largely nonoverlapping with
E2-activated genes. Among CARM1-repressed genes, many are activated by E2 (see blowup of the heat map), indicating that overexpressing CARM1 can
inhibit some E2-activated genes. B, pie graph shows that among all E2-upregulated genes, 16% of them are downregulated by CARM1 overexpression.
The bottom of chart shows, among all CARM1-downregulated, E2-upregulated genes, the percentage of genes in each molecular function category. GO of
the affected genes was determined by GOStat tool online (http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/cgi-bin/goStat.pl),"goa_human" database, where % represent the
percentage of the affected genes that belong to each represented category. C, pie graph shows that among all E2-downregulated genes, 56% of them are
upregulated by CARM1 overexpression. The bottom chart shows, among all CARM1-upregulated, E2-downregulated genes, the percentage of genes in

suggesting that CARM1 may regulate some genes in hormonedeprived conditions.
The global effects of CARM1 on ER target genes were next
examined in the loss-of-function model, MCF7-Tet-onshCARM1 under aforementioned conditions. The heat
map of the fold-change gene signature relative to vehicle
control is shown in Figure 5A and additional description can
be found in Supplementary Methods. Using Agilent array
platform herein, CARM1 shRNA expression upregulated 62
genes and downregulated 2,122 genes (P < 0.05, fold change
1.6 and 0.6 compared with vehicle, respectively). E2
treatment upregulated 780 genes and downregulated 5,099
genes (P < 0.05, fold change 1.6). Interestingly, the genes
affected by loss-of-CARM1 largely overlapped with those
affected by E2 in wild-type cells. Further microarray analysis

showed that 65% of genes activated by knocking down
CARM1 are also activated by E2 (Fig. 5B) and 75% of genes
repressed by CARM1 knockdown are also repressed by E2
(Fig. 5C). GO of genes affected by Dox and E2 treatment also
overlap (Fig. 5B and C). Among these genes, a majority are
involved in metabolism, development, protein binding, and
gene expression (Fig. 5B and C). These data further support
the notions that CARM1 is a global regulator of E2-responsive genes in breast cancer cells and profoundly affects
estrogen-mediated processes. We also validated the effect
of loss of CARM1 on p21cip1, p27kip1, cyclin G2, MAZ, GATA3, and KRTAP10.12 mRNA expression. Loss of CARM1 significantly repressed p21cip1, p27kip1, cyclin G2, MAZ, GATA-3,
KRTAP10.12, and DSP1 at mRNA levels, similar to the effect
of E2 in MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1 (Fig. 5D and Supplementary

decreased at protein levels with the loss of CARM1. Since
both cyclin G2 (33) and GATA-3 (36) are ERa target genes,
CARM1 may antagonize E2 action via ERa during reprogramming of ERa-dependent differentiation and proliferation processes. Fold changes of key cell-cycle regulators and
genes involved in cell differentiation in MCF7-Tet-onshCARM1 are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Overall,
our data suggest that loss of CARM1 induces gene signatures
resembling those affected by E2 and CARM1 is a regulator of
E2-dependent, key cell cycle progression, and differentiation
genes. Collectively, the microarray analyses using CARM1
gain-of-function and loss-of-function cell models reveal that
CARM1 is a unique ER coactivator that profoundly affects
the balance of genes involved in cellular differentiation and
proliferation (i.e., inhibit cell growth and promote cell
differentiation).

Knocking down of CARM1 increased E2-dependent
tumor growth in an MCF7 xenograft mouse model
To examine the effects of CARM1 in vivo, we transplanted
MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 shRNA cells in nude mice. The design of
the xenograft experiment is shown in Figure 6A, representing
one of triplicate experiments. We first validated that the
growth of xenografted tumors was E2-dependent because
no growth or only tiny tumors developed in the negative
control group not receiving estrogen. Tumors collected from
mice engrafted with MCF7-Tet-on-shCARM1 cells and receiving Dox showed a reduction of CARM1 expression at the
mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 6B). Knocking down CARM1
increased the size of E2-induced tumors (Fig. 6C) and was
associated with a modest increase in BrdU labeling. The
differential rate of BrdU labeling for xenografted tumors
was further increased in mice receiving a higher dose of E2
and that was associated with higher mitotic index (Fig. 6D and
E). All the data suggest that knocking down CARM1 enhances

E2-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells in vivo. Since
CARM1 inhibits E2-dependent growth by modulating negative
cell-cycle regulators p21cip1, p27kip1, and cyclin G2 and prodifferentiation genes, we examined the relationship between
p21cip1 and E-cadherin, a differentiation marker, in E2induced xenografted tumors. A direct correlation was
observed between p21cip1 and E-cadherin expression in
tumors derived from xenografts (Fig. 6F), suggesting inhibition of cell growth and induction of differentiation are coherent processes in ERa-positive tumors.

between CARM1 expression and tumor grade in ER-positive,
node-negative human breast tumors (P < 0.0398; Supplementary Fig. 8B). Collectively, the findings from clinical samples
support a role of CARM1 in regulating ERa-dependent differentiation in ERa-positive tumors.

Discussion
In most cases, proliferation and differentiation are inversely
coupled: repression of proliferation is a prerequisite for initiation of differentiation (11). In many cell types, however, cellcycle arrest is necessary but not sufficient for differentiation.
CARM1 seems to be a unique ER coactivator regulating both
processes. Overexpression of CARM1 in MCF7 cells results in
inhibition of E2-dependent growth through inhibition of the
G0/G1 transition to S phase. This is in part due to upregulation
of key negative cell-cycle regulators such as p21cip1, p27kip1,
and cyclin G2. Inhibition of E2-dependent cell growth by
CARM1 is accompanied by morphologic changes characteristic of a more differentiated phenotype and induction of
multiple differentiation markers such as GATA-3 and MAZ.
This finding is supported by previous reports that CARM1 can
promote cell differentiation in other systems (19–21). Nonetheless, regulation of cell differentiation by CARM1 seems to
be cell-type and context dependent. In mouse embryo and
embryonic stem cells, CARM1 was shown to elevate expression of key pluripotency genes and delay their response to
differentiation signals (38).
In contrast to growth inhibition by CARM1 overexpression,
knocking down CARM1 in MCF7 did not alter E2-dependent
cell growth in cell culture, nor did it affect E2-induced S-phase
entry. This observation contradicts the conclusion by Frietze
and colleagues that CARM1 increases growth of MCF7 cells.
The discrepancies may be due to the transient transfection of
CARM1 siRNA throughout the cell-cycle study by Frietze and
colleagues (16). Moreover, the authors measured the percen-

2126

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

tage of cells in S þ G2 þ M phase without distinguishing the
percentage of cells in S phase. Also, in consistent with the
observation of O’Brien and colleagues (21), we did not observe
change of E2F1 with CARM1 knockdown in contrast to Frietze
and colleagues (16). Interestingly, and in contrast to cells
grown in culture, knocking down CARM1 enhanced E2induced xenograft tumors. This may be due to increased
breast cancer cell interaction with the microenvironment
which plays essential roles in promoting tumor growth in
animals.
The growth inhibitory effect of CARM1 is unique from that
of SRCs. Knocking down SRC2 and SRC3 but not SRC1 inhibits
growth of MCF7 cells and decreases cyclin D1 expression (39).
Overexpression of SRC3 also increases breast cancer cell
proliferation and invasiveness. Similarly, SRC-1 promotes
breast tumor metastasis and inhibits tumor cell differentiation (40). Thus, the ERa-dependent, growth inhibitory effect of
CARM1 is unlikely to be mediated through SRC1, 2, and 3.
Cell-cycle genes that are regulated by E2 or loss of CARM1
include cyclin D1, c-Myc, cyclin G2, cyclin L1, cyclin T2,
p21cip1, p27kip1, p130, and Rb (Supplementary Table S1). E2
treatment alone significantly represses cyclin G2 (33), which is
reversed by overexpressing CARM1. Cyclin D1 is a well-known,
E2-induced ERa target gene; however, its expression is not
affected by overexpression of CARM1 in the presence of E2, yet
knocking down CARM1 upregulates cyclin D1 in MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Table S1). c-Myc is upregulated by E2 alone or
loss of CARM1 (Supplementary Table S1) but is not affected by
depletion of any of the p160 coactivators in MCF7 cells (39).
Thus, the mechanism of CARM1 regulation of cell-cycle
regulators is complex and only partially depends on the
p160 coactivators.
Microarray gene expression analyses reveal that approximately 16% of E2-activated genes were repressed by CARM1,
consistent with the repressive effects of CARM1 on some ER
target genes (41). The mechanism of CARM1-mediated repression is unclear. The major effect of CARM1 overexpression was

CARM1 Regulates ERa-Dependent Cellular Processes

to relieve E2-repressed genes. CARM1 methyltransferase activity may be responsible for the activation because we observed
increased H3R17Me2 mark on p21cip1 promoter upon CARM1
induction in MCF7-Tet-on-CARM1 (data not shown), consistent with a recent publication that CARM1 is recruited to
p21cip1 promoter (42). Whether CARM1 regulates ERa target
genes via an epigenetic mechanism remains to be determined.
Nonetheless, global ERa transcriptional regulation by CARM1
leads to the induction of many E2-repressed genes associated
with differentiation.
Consistent with this finding, knocking down CARM1 shares
more than 65% of the E2 gene signature. Most CARM1- and E2regulated genes are involved in gene expression, metabolism,
cell cycle, and differentiation. Knocking down CARM1 leads to
upregulation of positive cell-cycle regulators (e.g., c-Myc) and
downregulation of negative cell-cycle regulators (e.g., cyclin
G2). This result suggests that loss of CARM1 function may lead
to the acquisition of a proliferative phenotype resembling
estrogen stimulation of breast cancer. Furthermore, knocking
down CARM1 also modulates genes involved in cell differentiation. For example, combination of CARM1 shRNA and E2
treatment significantly reduced the level of PPARg, which
induces terminal differentiation of breast cancer (43). Loss
of CARM1 also significantly decreases KRTAP10.12, an E2repressed gene involved in keratin filament formation and
potentially in cell differentiation processes (44, 45). Collectively, either loss of CARM1 or E2 treatment significantly
inhibits expression of various differentiation markers (Supplementary Table S1). Overall, the gene expression data from
CARM1 gain-of-function and loss-of-function models suggest
that CARM1 plays an important role in regulating ERa target
genes in differentiation and proliferation.
Evidence for a functional interplay of ERa and CARM1 was
explored in human breast cancer specimens. A direct correlation was observed between CARM1 and ERa in ER-positive
tumors. Higher ERa expression is associated with less aggressive and more differentiated tumors, and ER status is known
to inversely correlate with histologic grade (46). Our observation contradicts an earlier report that CARM1 is overexpressed in grade III breast tumors (23). The difference
could result from analysis of RNA versus protein and the
sample size. In the study by El Messaoudi and colleagues,
CARM1 was analyzed only at the RNA level in 81 human breast
tumors whereas we analyzed CARM1 protein level in more
than 300 human breast tumors.

Histologic grade using the Nottingham method integrates
scores from glandular differentiation, nuclear morphology, and
mitotic counts (47, 48), and higher grade is significantly associated with poor outcome and survival. The inverse correlation
of CARM1 expression and tumor grade found in ER-positive
breast cancer cases, together with enhanced tumor volume in
CARM1 knockdown breast cancer xenografts in animal models, supports an association of low levels of CARM1 with less
well-differentiated, high-grade breast cancers and is consistent
with the hypothesis that CARM1 inhibits breast cancer progression in ERa-positive tumors. Our results suggest that
coexpression of ERa and CARM1 together may serve as a
better biomarker of well-differentiated breast cancers.
ERa is believed to regulate growth and differentiation
through balanced interaction with cofactors. This study
reports an unexpected biological function of the ER coactivator CARM1 in breast cancer. The hallmark of CARM1 action
might be due to global modulation of E2-regulated genes,
leading to reprogramming of cell proliferation and differentiation. To our knowledge, CARM1 is the only ER coactivator that
is able to simultaneously block cell proliferation and induce
differentiation. Since CARM1 has histone modification activity, inducing differentiation of breast cancer cells by upregulating CARM1 activity may be therapeutically effective in
breast cancer.
