ABSTRACT
The mechanism of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer is not clearly understood.
In the present investigation, we found that the expression levels of miR-497 were
reduced in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer cells and tumor tissues due
to hypermethylation of miR-497 promoter. Low miR-497 expression levels were
associated with chemo-resistant phonotype of ovarian cancer. By analyzing the
expression levels of miR-497, mTOR and p70S6K1 in a clinical gene-expression array
dataset, we found that mTOR and p70S6K1, two proteins correlated to chemotherapyresistance in multiple types of human cancers, were inversely correlated with miR497 levels in ovarian cancer tissues. By using an orthotopic ovarian tumor model
and a Tet-On inducible miR-497 expression system, our results demonstrated
that overexpression of miR-497 sensitizes the resistant ovarian tumor to cisplatin
treatment. Therefore, we suggest that miR-497 might be used as a therapeutic
supplement to increase ovarian cancer treatment response to cisplatin.

INTRODUCTION

of cisplatin-based resistance limits its successful clinical
application in cancer patients [5]. Despite the knowledge
that has been accumulated over decades, the mechanisms
of cisplatin resistance are not fully understood.
MiRNAs are small endogenous non-coding
RNAs composed of about 19-24 nucleotides that bind
to imperfect sequence homology sites of mRNA and
recruit the RNA-induced silencing complex, causing
either degradation or inhibition of protein translation, thus
effectively silencing their mRNA targets [6]. It has been

prognosis remains disappointing [2, 3]. More than 75%
of patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinoma

less than 30% [4]. Cisplatin is one of the most effective

reported that miRNA-mediated gene regulation involvoed
in biological processes including cell proliferation,
migration and invasion, differentiation, survival, and
tumorigenesis [7, 8]. Recent studies showed that miRNAs
also play a vital role in chemotherapeutic resistance [9,
10], highlighting miRNAs as potent therapeutic targets
or chemoresistant modulators in cancer treatment. MiR497 is one of the tumor suppressor miRNAs in human
cancer. Downregulation of miR-497 has been found in
breast, cervical, head-and-neck, colorectal, and prostate
cancer [11-14]. Reduced expression of miR-497 has been
associated with malignancy of breast and colorectal cancer
[11, 14]. In addition, forced expression of miR-497 is able
to suppress cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo
[15-16]. Finally, increasing evidence indicates that miR497 negatively regulates numerous well-characterized
oncogenic proteins, such as IGF-1R [13], CCND1 [11],
CDC25A, CDK6, CDK4 [17], and BCL-2 [18]. Although
miR-497 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene
in many human cancers, its role in chemotherapeutical

resistance has not been fully addressed. The objective
of this study was to reveal the molecular mechanisms of
miR-497 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
MiR-497 expression was downregulated in
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and
ovarian cancer specimens
To determine the crucial miRNAs involved in
ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance, we performed
microarray assay to profile the global expression of mature
miRNAs in A2780 and A2780/CP cell lines. The signal
ratios of A2780/CP to A2780 were assessed. Differentially
expressed miRNAs with at least 2-fold alternation were
selected (Figure 1A). Consistent with other studies, we
also found that let-7e and let-7i were among the top 10

downregulated miRNAs and miR-214 was upregulated in
A2780/CP compared with A2780. Importantly, miR-497
was remarkably downregulated in A2780/CP compared
with A2780 (Figure 1B-1E). To further validate this
finding, we examined miR-497 expression levels in

SKOV3 and SKOV3/CP cell lines. The results showed
that miR-497 levels were significantly reduced in SKOV3/
CP cells compared with SKOV3 cells (Figure 1F). We
further investigated the association of miR-497 levels
in primary ovarian tumors and its response to platinum-

significant lower in platinum sensitive tumors compared
with platinum resistant tumors (Figure 1G), indicating that
miR-497 may play an important role in the development of
cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.

in its promoter regions. We compared methylation
status of the promoter of miR-497 in A2780 and A2780/
CP or in SKOV3 and SKOV3/CP cells by methylationspecific PCR (MSP) analysis. Hypermethylation of
miR-497 promoter was identified in A2780 and SKOV3
cells compared with A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP cells,
respectively (Figure 2A-2B). To further determine
whether DNA methylation is responsible for miR-497
downregulation, we treated A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP
cells with or without 5-Aza-dC, a demethylation reagent,
and performed MSP assay. Demethylation treatment
by 5-Aza-dC dramatically restored both pri-miR-497
and matured miR-497 expression levels in A2780/CP
and SKOV3/CP cells (Figure 2C-2D), indicating that
hypermethylation plays a crucial role in the silencing of

MiR-497 downregulation was due to DNA
methylation
To explore the mechanism of miR-497
downregulation in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells,
we first analyzed the genomic DNA sequence within
3-kilobase promoter regions of miR-497 gene, and found
miR-497 gene contains CpG-rich regions (CpG islands)

miR-497 expression. We next analyzed miR-497 promoter
methylation status in 28 ovarian cancer samples. The
MSP results showed that the methylation levels of miR497 promoter regions in platinum resistant tumors were
dramatically higher than those in platinum sensitive
tumors (Figure 2E-2F). Collectively, these results
indicated that DNA hypermethylation may be the main
reason for miR-497 downregulation in ovarian cancer
cells.

To confirm these targets, reporter constructs were made to
contain the putative binding sites of mTOR and p70S6K1
3’-UTR regions, or with 3 nucleotide substitute in their
3’-UTR regions (Mut). The luciferase activities from the
mTOR and p70S6K1 wild-type construct were inhibited
upon overexpression of miR-497 and were induced by
inhibition of miR-497. Point mutations in putative binding
site abrogated the effect of miR-497, demonstrating that
miR-497 specifically target the mTOR and p70S6K1 3’
UTR by binding to the identified seed sequence (Figure
4B-4C). Furthermore, forced expression of miR-497 by
transient transfection repressed both mTOR and p70S6K1
protein expression in A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP cells;
whereas blockade of endogenous miR-497 using antisense
inhibitors increased both mTOR and p70S6K1 expression
levels in A2780 and SKOV3 (Figure 4D-4E). Similar
effects of miR-497 on targeting mTOR and p70S6K1
have also been observed in multiple human cancer
cells (data not shown). No significant differences were
found in mTOR and p70S6K1 mRNA levels (data not
shown), indicating that mTOR and p70S6K1 expression
is regulated at the translational level through miR-497.
These results demonstrated that miR-497 directly targets
mTOR and p70S6K1 to repress their protein expression by
binding to their 3’-UTR regions.

MiR-497 is involved in cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer phonotype
To investigate the roles of miR-497 in cisplatinresistant phonotype of ovarian cancer cells, we forced
expression of miR-497 in A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP cells
with low endogenous miR-497 levels by transfection of
cells with miR-497 precursor or a control precursor (miRNS). We also inhibited levels of miR-497 in A2780 and
SKOV3 cells by transfection of cells with anti-miR-497
inhibitor or a control inhibitor (anti-miR-NS). MiR-497
overexpression dramatically reduced A2780/CP and
SKOV3/CP cells resistance to cisplatin (Figure 3A). On
the contrary, inhibition of miR-497 expression markedly
increased A2780 and SKOV3 cells tolerance to cisplatin
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, consistent with the results from
MTT assay, we found that overexpression of miR-497
significantly sensitized A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP cells to
cisplatin treatment (Figure 3C-3D). Next, we generated
Tet-On-based stable cell lines for inducible expression
of miR-497 in A2780/CP-Tet-ON-miR-497 and SKOV3/
CP-Tet-ON-miR-497 cells. Doxycycline (Dox) treatment
significantly increased miR-497 expression in A2780/CPTet-ON-miR-497 and SKOV3/CP-Tet-ON-miR-497 cells,
as compared with miR-NS expressing cells or doxycycline
non-treatment groups (Figure 3E). We observed that miR497 over-expression in A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP cells
resulted in much stronger cisplatin treatment response
than transient miR-497 restoration. Dox treatment altered
miR-497 expression or cisplatin resistance of both A2780/
CP and SKOV3/CP cells (Figure 3F). Taken together,
downregulation of miR-497 expression render ovarian
cancer cells resistant to cisplatin treatment.

MiR-497 decreases cisplatin resistance through
targeting mTOR and p70S6K1
We found that the expression levels of mTOR and
p70S6K1 were upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer cells (A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP) compared with
cisplatin-sensitive cells (A2780 and SKOV3) (Figure
5A). To investigate whether miR-497 overexpression
enhanced the cisplatin response sensitivity of ovarian
cancer cells via targeting mTOR and p70S6K1, we
performed mTOR and p70S6K1 loss- and gain-offunction experiments in ovarian cancer cells. Doxycycline
treatment-induced stable-expressing miR-497 constantly
decreased both mTOR and p70S6K1 expression in A2780/
CP and SKOV3/CP, as well as dramatically reduced
cells resistance to cisplatin treatment (Figure 5B-5C).
Knockdown of endogenous mTOR and p70S6K1 exerted a
similar effect as overexpression of miR-497 on decreasing
resistance of ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5D). Next, we
used lentiviral particles carrying mTOR or p70S6K1
cDNAs lacking their 3’-UTR regions to infect miR-497
stable-expressing ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly,
forced expression of mTOR and p70S6K1 partially
or completely restored miR-497-inhibited cisplatin
resistance in ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5E-5F). These
results indicated that miR-497 downregulation promotes
acquisition of cisplatin-resistant ability in ovarian cancer
cell via inducing mTOR and p70S6K1 overexpression.

mTOR and p70S6K1 are direct targets of miR497
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of how
miR-497 decreases cisplatin resistance, we employed
several well-developed miRNA algorithms, such as
TargetScan, PicTar, and miRNA.org, to obtain a list of
possible mRNA targets of miR-497. Among the search
results, mTOR and p70S6K1 captured our attention
because they were reported to be involved in cisplatin
resistance in multiple human cancers [19-21] (Figure 4A).

collected (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6B-6D, tumor
weights and volume in the miR-497 + cisplatin group
were smaller than those in the miR-NS + cisplatin group.
The levels of miR-497 were significantly higher and the
levels of mTOR and p70S6K1 were dramatically lower

To test whether restoration of miR-497 expression
in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells can enhance the
response of cisplatin treatment in vivo, we established an
orthotopic ovarian tumor model by implantation of A2780/

in nude mouse ovary. On Day 6 after cell implantation,

every five days for a total of 30 days. After 34 days of cell

MiR-497 levels were inversely correlated with
mTOR and p70S6K1 levels in tissues from

miR-497 interaction, we performed in silico analysis
for miR-497 and mTOR/p70S6K1 expression from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 2011 dataset for Ovarian
Cancer, comprising of 489 patient samples with followup information (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B-7D,
miR-497 and mTOR/p70S6K1 were inversely correlated
in ovarian cancer tissues, while mTOR and p70S6K1 were
positively correlated.

The above studies showed that miR-497 directly
target mTOR and p70S6K1 to repress their protein
expression by binding to their 3’-UTR regions. To further
test the physiological relevance of mTOR/p70S6K1 and

sensitivity tumors. G.-H. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed an inverse correlation between miR-497 and mTOR levels (R =

Next, mTOR and p70S6K1 mRNA levels were
quantified using real-time PCR. We observed that both
mTOR and p70S6K1 were significantly upregulated
in platinum resistant tumors compared with platinum
sensitivity tumors, respectively (Figure 7E-7F).
Furthermore, spearman’s rank correlation analysis
revealed an inverse correlation between miR-497 and
mTOR, and p70S6K1 exists in our ovarian cancer samples
(Figure 7G-7H). Taken together, these results showed
lower expression levels of miR-497 were inversely
correlated with mTOR/p70S6K1 levels of ovarian cancer
patients.

the miR-497 promoter play a crucial role for silencing
expression of miR-497 and demethylation by 5-AZA
treatment can reverse miR-497 expression in cisplatinresistant ovarian cancer cells. The molecular mechanism
of cisplatin-induced hyper-methylation of miR-497 gene
will be the focus of our future study.
Our results demonstrated that mTOR and p70S6K1
are two direct targets of miR-497, highlighting the
potential role of miR-497 downregulation for ovarian
cancer cells to develop a chemoresistance phenotype. The
mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway has been reported as a
critical regulator of cellular metabolism, growth, survival,
and drug resistance [32-34]. Overexpression of mTOR
or p70S6K1 has been found in many human cancers and
is associated with tumor malignancy and poor prognosis
[35, 36]. However, the mechanisms of posttranscriptional
regulation of mTOR or p70S6K1 have yet to be elucidated.
We showed that miR-497 could suppress both mTOR
and p70S6K1 protein expressions through the binding of
these miRNAs to their 3’-UTR regions. Downregulation
of miR-497 contributes to high levels of mTOR and
p70S6K1, which makes ovarian cancer cells resistant to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
To study the impact of miR-497 in ovarian cancer
tumor resistance to cisplatin treatment in vivo, we
employed an orthotopic ovarian tumor model and a TetOn inducible miR-497 system. In the orthotopic ovarian
tumor model, ovarian tumors were formed in mice
normal ovary, which provides a better microenvironment
than subcutaneous injection. The advantage of the TetOn inducible miR-497 system is that the expression of
miR-497 is more controllable by addition or depletion
of Dox in drinking water than long-term continuous
stable-expressing miR-497 cell lines. Our data showed
that induced-expressing of miR-497 in cisplatin-resistant
ovarian cancer cells exert a much better cisplatin
treatment effect on ovarian tumor growth than control
groups, indicating a possible application for miR-497
as a “supplement” to conventional cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Applied cisplatin with miR-497 may help
to reduce the rate of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer
occurrence and improve the overall response rate to
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that 1) miR497 was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines and tumors; 2) DNA hypermethylation
contribute to downregulation of miR-497; 3) mTOR and
p70S6K1 are two direct targets of miR-497 with biological
function that are associated with development of cisplatinresistance phonotype; and 4) overexpression of miR-497
decreases cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have reported that miRNAs are
aberrantly expressed in ovarian cancer and are associated
with tumor stages, histological subtypes, recurrent tumors
and survival [22-26]. Recently, increasing evidence also
showed that miRNAs can affect sensitivity of ovarian
cancer to various chemotherapy agents. For example,
low levels of let-7i associated with chemoresistance
in ovarian cancer and knockdown of let-7i decreased
cisplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell death [10]. MiR200c overexpression may increase the sensitivity to
microtubule-targeting drugs through repressing the
expression of the tubulin molecule TUBB3 [27]. In
addition, miR-214 is involved in chemosensitivity
by modulating PTEN expression, an important tumor
suppressor gene [9]. Thus far, only a limited number of
miRNAs has been found to impact chemoresistance in
ovarian cancer and the effect of miRNAs in mediating
sensitivity to anticancer treatment in ovarian cancer
remain incompletely understood. In the present study,
we performed miRNA expression profiling in cisplatinsensitive cell lines (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant cell
lines (A2780/CP). Our results showed that downregulation
of let-7i, let-7e and upregulation of miR-214 in A2780/CP
compared with A2780. Based on our previously studies
[28, 29], we identified miR-497 as a new miRNA involved
in cisplatin sensitivity. The expression levels of miR-497
were significantly decreased in both cisplatin-resistant cell
lines (A2780/CP and SKOV3/CP) as well as in platinumresistant ovarian cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR497 by transient transfection or Tet-ON-induced system
decreased cisplatin-resistance of A2780/CP and SKOV3/
CP cells.
Epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation
has been shown to play an important role in the
development of cisplatin resistance. Demethylation drug
treatments have been shown to reverse cisplatin resistance
by restoring the expression of certain resistance-related
gene expression [30, 31]. However, there is less evidence
showing that epigenetic regulated miRNAs contribute
to the development of a cisplatin-resistant phenotype.
Our results demonstrated that increased methylation of

µM of 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) (Sigma, MO,
USA) for 120 h, with replacing the fresh drug each day.
Cisplatin was obtained from Sigma (St. Louise, MO).

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol Reagent
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were synthesized
with TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Life
Technologies). The expression levels of miRNAs were
analyzed using Taqman MicroRNA Assay Kits (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) specific for hsa-Let-7e, hsaLet-7i, hsa-miR-214, hsa-miR-497 precursors, p70S6K1
and mTOR mRNAs. The fold stimulation was determined
using the comparative cycle threshold method (2−∆∆CT)
[37]. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Tissue samples
A collection of 41 different kinds of fresh-frozen
ovarian cancer tumor specimens were from the tissue bank
of Nanjing Medical University. All tumor samples were
collected immediately after the surgical removal and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. The clinical characteristics of the
ovarian cancer patients are listed in Table 1. All patients
provided written informed consent and the experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Nanjing Medical University. Progression-free
survival (PFS) was calculated from time of surgery to time
of progression or recurrence. PFS > 6 months was defined
as sensitivity to the last platinum-based chemotherapy;
and PFS < 6 months was defined as resistant to the last
platinum-based chemotherapy.

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with protein
inhibitors. Total proteins (20-40 µg) from each sample
were electrophoresised on 8 % SDS-PAGE gel, and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and probed with the
primary antibodies as indicated overnight at 4°C. The
membranes were washed and probed with the secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the
developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo
Scientific).R

Construction of Tet-On 3G inducible expression
systems

DNA methylation analysis

Tet-On 3G inducible expression systems were
purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. The hsamiR-497 and hsa-miR-NS fragments were PCR amplified
from hsa-miR-497 and hsa-miR-NS overexpression
plasmids obtained from Open biosystems. The purified
fragments were inserted into pTRE3G plasmid to obtain
pTRE3G-miR-497 or pTRE3G-miR-NS plasmid. pCMVTet3G plasmid was transfected into target cells, then
selected by G418 for stably expressing cells. Then cells
were transfected with pTRE3G-miR-497 or pTRE3GmiR-NS plasmid. After a second round of selection, cell
lines were established and comfirmed for expressing high
levels of hsa-miR-497 or hsa-miR-NS in response to
doxycycline (Dox).

Genomic DNAs were purified using DNA Mini
kit (Qiagen, MD, USA). Genomic DNAs were modified
with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Kit (Qiagen)
following the manufacturer’s instruction, then analyzed by
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) using primers for either
methylated or unmethylated DNA.
Methylation-specific PCR primers are summarized

Coexpression analysis of 2011 TCGA dataset
A normalized mRNA expression dataset for ovarian
cancer [39] was downloaded from the cBioPortal for
cancer genomics and used to evaluate coexpression
of mTOR, p70S6K1, and miR-497 transcript levels.
This dataset includes mRNA profiles for 489 primary
tumor samples. Spearman’s correlation coefficiency was
calculated for these transcripts for all primary tumor
samples. Differences were considered significant with p
< 0.05.

Statistical analysis
All results were analyzed using SPSS for windows
version 13 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative
variables were analyzed by t-test or ANOVA. The
correlations were analyzed using Spearman’s rank test.
Differences were considered significant with p less
than 0.05. Data represent mean plus SD from at least 3
replications, unless indicated specifically otherwise.

MTT assay
Cells (1×104) were seeded into 96-well plates.
After cellular adhesion, medium containing cisplatin at
distinct concentrations (0.1-1000 μM) was added to the
corresponding cells. After 72 h, cell viability was assessed
using the MTT Cell Proliferation Assay (life technologies).
MTT reagent was prepared in fresh medium (100 μL
medium + 20 μL MTT solution) and applied to the cells.
The absorbance at 590 nm for each well was read on a
spectrophotometer [38].
