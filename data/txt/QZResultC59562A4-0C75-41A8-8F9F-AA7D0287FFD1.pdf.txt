BACKGROUND: Burkitt lymphoma post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (Burkitt-PTLD) is a rare form of monomorphic
B-cell PTLD for which no standard treatment has been established. Currently, the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma outside the posttransplantation setting involves high doses of alkylating agents, frequent dosing, and intrathecal and/or systemic central nervous system prophylaxis. In PTLD, however, such protocols are associated with considerable toxicity and mortality. METHODS: The authors
present a retrospective series of 8 adult patients with Burkitt-PTLD. Six patients were reported to the prospective German PTLD
registry or were enrolled in the PTLD-1 trial, and 2 patients had received treatment before 2000, thus allowing for comparison with
the pre-rituximab era. RESULTS: Seven of the 8 patients were men. The median age at presentation was 38 years, and the median
time since transplantation was 5.7 years. Five of 8 patients had histologically established, Epstein-Barr virus-associated disease, and 7
of 7 patients were positive for a MYC translocation. Five of 8 patients received sequential immunochemotherapy (4 courses of rituximab [R] followed by 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone [CHOP] or R plus CHOP [R-CHOP]). In
this group, 5 of 5 patients reached complete remission (CR), and their overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (P ¼ .008) compared with the OS for 2 of 8 patients who received first-line CHOP and did not respond. One of 8 patients (who had stage IV disease
with meningiosis) received combination therapy (cyclophosphamide pretreatment, rituximab, intrathecal chemotherapy, whole-brain
irradiation, and radioimmunotherapy) and reached CR. Overall, 6 of 8 patients reached CR; and, after a median follow-up of 4.7 years
(range, 1.7-4.8 years), the median OS was 36.7 months. There was no treatment-related mortality under first-line therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest adult case series in Burkitt-PTLD to date, sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab followed by standard

INTRODUCTION
Burkitt lymphoma (BL)1 is characterized clinically by extranodal manifestations of exceedingly rapid growth and histologically by diffuse growth of fairly uniform, medium-sized lymphoid cells with frequent mitotic figures; expression of germinal center B-cell–associated antigens, including cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20 [acute lymphoblastic leukemia
antigen]), CD10 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen), and B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6); a very high proliferative index;
and (usually) the absence of BCL2 expression. In most (but not all) cases of BL, a v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene
homolog (avian) (MYC) translocation, most commonly to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) gene, can be demonstrated. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association is very common in the endemic subtype of BL; in addition, the World

Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes
sporadic BL and immunodeficiency-associated BL clinical
variants.2
Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder
(PTLD), conversely, is a spectrum of lymphoproliferations
associated with the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs
after transplantation3 and ranges from polyclonal, early
lesions associated with primary EBV infection to monomorphic lymphomas, as reflected in the WHO classification.4 The majority of monomorphic PTLD lesions
resemble diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).5,6 The
prospective PTLD-1 trial recently demonstrated a 90%
overall response rate and a median overall survival of 6.6
years with sequential immunochemotherapy in adult
patients with CD20-positive PTLD.7 However, PTLD
subtypes like BL (Burkitt-PTLD) are rare; and, currently,
their treatment is not based on clinical trials.
An association with EBV, a ubiquitous lymphotropic and epitheliotropic c1-herpesvirus first discovered
in BL cell cultures,8 is detectable not only in BL but also
in other lymphoma entities, including monomorphic
PTLD in approximately 50% of patients.5-7 However, viral gene expression varies considerably: Although it is limited in BL (latency type I), the (highly antigenic)
expression of EBV proteins, such as latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2
(EBNA2), is frequent, particularly in early PTLD (latency
type III).9
The oncogene MYC is a key player in lymphomagenesis and is involved in cell cycle control on multiple
levels.10 MYC translocations are characteristic for BL but
can be identified in other lymphoma entities, particularly
DLBCL, in which they have been associated with a poor
prognosis.11 In the latter, MYC translocations usually are
associated with a more complex karyotype and additional
translocations (for example, of BCL2 and/or BCL6).
The current treatment of (sporadic) BL in adults is
based on chemotherapy, including high doses of alkylating agents, frequent dosing and intrathecal and/or systemic central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis (for a
review, see Perkins and Friedberg12). This includes
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated BL in
the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy13,14 as well
as patients aged >40 years.15 Addition of the monoclonal
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to BL protocols, such as
combined cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,
and methotrexate/etoposide, ifosfamide, and cytarabine
(CODOX-M/IVAC) and hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
(Hyper-CVAD), has led to significantly lower recurrence

rates.16,17 In PTLD, even first-line cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) every
3 weeks (CHOP-21) is associated with considerable toxicity and a treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of up to
31% in patients with DLBCL-PTLD.18 Treatment of
post-transplantation BL and Burkitt-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia within an adult BL protocol led to TRM
in 3 of 5 patients (60%).19 Conversely, sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab and CHOP in the
PTLD-1 trial had a TRM rate of only 10.6%.7
Other previous case series in adult (n ¼ 5)20 and pediatric (n ¼ 12)21 Burkitt-PTLD have been limited by
their retrospective formats and limited access to clinical
and pathologic data. Here, we present a retrospective series of 8 patients from the German prospective PTLD
registry, the PTLD-1 trial, and the Department of Hematology, Charite Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, including
clinicopathologic features and detailed information on
treatment and outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We initiated the prospective German PTLD registry with
the goal of assessing clinical features, treatment options,
and outcomes in adult patients with rare PTLD subtypes
after solid organ transplantation (SOT) in 2006. Because
Burkitt-PTLD is CD20-positive, patients also were eligible for enrollment in the European prospective phase 2
trial investigating sequential treatment with rituximab
and CHOP-21 in patients with CD20-positive B-cell
PTLD who were unresponsive to immunosuppression
reduction (IR) (PTLD-1). Here, we report the patients
with Burkitt-PTLD that were enrolled on the registry or
on the PTLD-1 trial (from 12/2012). To allow for comparison with the prerituximab era, we retrospectively
retrieved the records of patients who presented to the Hematology Department at the Charite Virchow Clinic in
Berlin from 1995 to 2003 with a diagnosis of BurkittPTLD. We excluded patients who were negative for MYC
breaks and those who were diagnosed with B-cell PTLD,
unclassifiable, with features intermediate between
DLBCL and BL. Follow-up data were reviewed for all
patients up to July 2011. All patients provided written
informed consent.

MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 (all from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and the dual-color, dual-fusion translocation

an Axio Imager Z1 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and

Germany) was used.

acteristics were retrieved from databases at the different
transplantation centers.
Data Analysis

Exploratory univariate analyses were performed by applying log-rank analyses to Kaplan-Meier statistics for timeto-event outcomes and chi-square tests to categorical
variables. The level of significance in all analyses was set at
P < .05. Statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS
software (version 19.0.0.1; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

Treatment

For patients who were treated as part of or on the same
regimen as the PTLD-1 trial up to 2007, the protocol was
sequential treatment with rituximab followed by 4 cycles
of CHOP plus granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (GCSF) starting 4 weeks after the last dose of rituximab (Fig.
1A).7 After an interim analysis in 2007 demonstrated that
the response to treatment with rituximab (complete
remission [CR]/partial remission [PR] vs stable disease
[SD]/progressive disease [PD]) was a significant predictor
of overall survival, risk stratification was introduced
according to the patients’ response to rituximab treatment.22 Patients who achieved CR after 4 courses of rituximab carried on with 4 additional courses of rituximab at
3-week intervals, whereas all others received R-CHOP-21
plus G-CSF instead of CHOP-21 plus G-CSF (riskstratified sequential treatment) (Fig. 1B). The remaining
patients were treated on individual regimens.
Assessment of Treatment Response and
Outcome

The extent of existing disease was determined through a
complete patient history, physical examination, laboratory investigations (including a full blood count, lactate
dehydrogenase level [upper limit, 248 U/L], renal and
liver function tests, as well as determination of the EBV
DNA load in peripheral blood), bone marrow biopsy, and
computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis. Tumor response to treatment was defined according to WHO criteria. Disease-free survival was calculated
from the first evidence of CR to the date of either PD or
death from any cause; response duration was calculated
from the date of best response (CR or PR) to the date of
either PD or death from PTLD; and overall survival (OS)
was calculated from the date of PTLD diagnosis to the
date of death from any cause. In addition, CNS relapse
and CNS PD were defined as secondary CNS events.
Clinical data on all patients were collected before, during,
and at least 4 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24
months after treatment. Additional data on patient char4718

RESULTS
Baseline Findings

By mid-2011, 195 patients had been reported to the German PTLD registry or enrolled on the PTLD-1 trial. Of
this cohort, 6 patients (3%) had been diagnosed with Burkitt-PTLD (3 of 6 had been treated on the PTLD-1 trial,
2 of 6 patients had received the PTLD-1 trial regimen
[Patients 1-5], and the other patient had received an individual regimen [Patient 8]). One patient had a diagnosis
of B-cell PTLD, unclassifiable, with features intermediate
between DLBCL and BL and was not included in this series. Two other patients were identified from Charite
records (Patients 6 and 7). An additional patient from the
Charite records was excluded (this patient was diagnosed
originally with Burkitt-PTLD but was negative for an
MYC break).
The clinical baseline characteristics of the 8 patients
with Burkitt-PTLD are summarized in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 38 years (range, 18-54 years),
and 7 of the 8 patients (88%) were men. The transplanted solid organs were the kidney in 3 of 8 patients,
the kidney and pancreas in 1 of 8 patients, the liver in 3
of 8 patients, and the heart in 1 of 8 patients. Underlying
diseases included end-stage renal disease cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangits, and dilated cardiomyopathy.
The median time from transplantation to diagnosis of
Burkitt-PTLD was 5.7 years (range, 85 days to 12.5
years). Seven of 8 cases were late Burkitt-PTLD, and the
only case of early Burkitt-PTLD (ie, within 1 year of
transplantation) occurred in a man aged 54 years who
was seronegative for EBV immunoglobulin G at the time
of liver transplantation for cirrhosis secondary to chronic
hepatitis C virus infection. Immunosuppression at the
time of Burkitt-PTLD diagnosis ranged from singleagent cyclosporine A (CyA) or tacrolimus (FK) to double
therapy. FK-based immunosuppression was associated
with earlier disease onset after transplantation compared
with CyA-based immunosuppression (median time to
onset of PTLD, 2.5 years vs 8.5 years; P ¼ .022),

Clinical Presentation

Superficial, space-occupying lesions and secondary effects
of mass lesions ranging from VIth nerve palsy to flank
pain were the most common presenting complaints. At
presentation, B symptoms were present in 4 of 8 patients,
and Ann Arbor stage IV was the most frequent disease
stage (5 of 8 patients). Lymph node disease and extranodal
disease manifestations were present in 7 of 8 patients each;
and, in 6 of 8 patients, both were present. The most common extranodal site was bone marrow infiltration in 4 of
8 patients. Involvement of stomach, liver, and kidneys
occurred in 2 patients each. CNS disease (meningiosis
and sinus cavernosus infiltration) was present at diagnosis
in 1 of 8 patients (there were no CNS mass lesions). Disease manifestations >7.5 cm (bulky) were present in 3 of
8 patients at diagnosis. Regarding baseline laboratory
investigations, serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated
in 5 of 7 patients (range, 290-1846 U/L), b2 microglobulin was elevated in 4 of 4 patients (range, 2.5-10.5 mg/L),
and serum albumin was low in 1 of 4 patients (Table 3).

whereas the number of immunosuppressants (monotherapy vs combination treatment) had no significant impact
on the time of onset.
Immunohistochemistry revealed that tumor cells
were positive for CD20 in all 8 patients. In all tumors
examined, tumor cells were positive for CD10 (7 of 7
tumors), positive for BCL6 (5 of 5 tumors), and negative
for BCL2 (7 of 7 tumors). The Ki67 level was >95%
throughout. With regard to EBV status, the neoplastic
cells were latently infected by EBV in 5 of 8 tumors, as
demonstrated by EBER in situ hybridization (63%).
Wherever examined, tumor cells did not express EBNA2
(0 of 3 tumors) or LMP1 (0 of 5 tumors), confirming
EBV latency type I in this lymphoma entity. EBV DNA
load in peripheral blood was positive in 1 of 3 patients
examined. FISH analysis revealed evidence of an MYC
translocation in all 7 of 7 tumors examined. In 5 tumors
with sufficient tissue samples, the presence of additional
translocations involving the BCL2 and BCL6 genes could
be excluded (Table 2). In 1 tumor, an insufficient amount
of tissue sampled did not allow FISH analysis, and the diagnosis, which was based on morphology, proliferative
rate, and immunophenotype, was confirmed independently by 2 expert hematopathologists.

consisted of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum, 2 mg) on day 1, and prednisolone 100 mg on days 1 through 5 every 22 days; cyclophosphamide pretreatment consisted of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5; R-CHOP-21 consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2
on day 1; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum, 2 mg) on day 1, and prednisolone 100 mg on days 1-5 every 22 days; rituximab therapy consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m2 every 8 days; and Ara-C/MTX IT consisted
of Ara-C 40mg IT and MTX 15mg IT.
b
The following chemotherapy dose reduction (% of target dose administered) was used: The first cycle of CHOP was given at an average dose of 50% with a subsequent, stepwise dose increase up to 90% in
Cycle 4 and no vincristine in Cycles 5 and 6 because of peripheral neuropathy.
c
The following chemotherapy dose reduction (% of target dose administered) was used: 80% carboplatin in Cycle 2.
d
The following chemotherapy dose reduction was used: vincristine 2 mg on day 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg on day 3, doxorubicin 50 mg on day 3, and prednisolone 200 mg on days 1 through 5.
e
The following chemotherapy dose reduction (% of target dose administered) was used: 73% cyclophosphamide, 80% doxorubicin, and 0% vincristine.

Switzerland) and CHOP as first-line treatment, either as
sequential treatment (3 patients) or in sequence and in
combination (risk-stratified sequential treatment; 2
patients). Five of 5 patients responded (4 CRs and 1 PR
that was converted to CR with 2 cycles of carboplatin plus
etoposide [CE]) (see Table 4). After a median follow-up
of 4.7 years (range, 1.7-4.8 years), only 1 in 5 patients
who received rituximab and CHOP had relapsed. Having
received successful second-line salvage therapy (R-CE),
that patient remained alive without evidence of disease at
follow-up 8.8 months after second CR. There was only 1

death after sequential therapy (not PTLD-related). In
contrast, 2 patients (Patients 6 and 7) who were diagnosed
in 1995 and 1998 and received CHOP alone developed
PD on first-line therapy. Both patients rapidly developed
secondary CNS events and died shortly thereafter. One
patient (Patient 8) who had stage IV disease with meningiosis received cyclophosphamide pretreatment (200 mg/
m2 on days 1-5), rituximab combined with intrathecal
chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine), followed by
whole-brain irradiation and consolidating radioimmunotherapy (yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan; Bayer Pharma
AG, Berlin, Germany). CNS relapse occurred shortly
thereafter, and the patient died 8.4 months after the first diagnosis of Burkitt-PTLD. Therefore, in this series, the OS
of patients who received sequential rituximab and CHOP
was significantly longer compared with the OS of patients
who received CHOP alone (P ¼ .008) or any other treatment (P ¼ .004) (Fig. 2).
Regarding the roles of other treatment components,
IR produced no effect in 4 patients who had interim staging data available to allow an evaluation of IR in combination with single-agent rituximab or CHOP. One PR was
achieved with the combination of IR, cyclophosphamide
pretreatment, and rituximab. Intrathecal chemoprophylaxis (triple therapy with dexamethasone, methotrexate,
and cytarabine) was received by only 1 of 7 patients without CNS disease at diagnosis (Patient 5). That patient did
not develop a secondary CNS event. Because there was
only 1 such patient, the number was too small to draw any
meaningful conclusions about the impact of this
prophylaxis.
Overall, 6 of 8 patients responded to treatment and
reached CR. Two of 6 patients in CR developed a disease
relapse (at 77 days and 120 days, respectively). Disease
relapse was systemic in 1 patient and meningeal in the
other. Both patients who had PD on first-line therapy

developed CNS disease (Table 5). Subsequent treatment
strategies for these patients included chemotherapy with
rituximab, carboplatin, and etoposide23 for systemic
relapse and intrathecal methotrexate or systemic HD
cytarabine for the treatment of secondary CNS events.
The median disease-free survival for the 6 patients who
achieved CR was 30.6 months, whereas the median OS
for all patients was 36.7 months. Histologic EBV association had no impact on OS (P ¼ .281; data not shown).
The development of secondary CNS events was a
significant predictor of OS in univariate analysis (P ¼
.004) and was associated with the presence of bone marrow infiltration (P ¼ .028) and B-symptoms P ¼ .028) at
diagnosis. Crucially, the receipt of rituximab and especially its combination with CHOP significantly reduced
the risk of secondary CNS events (P ¼ .035 and P ¼ .005,
respectively). Correlations with other baseline characteristics or treatments did not reach statistical significance
(data not shown).
Treatment Toxicity

There was no treatment-related mortality (TRM) on firstline therapy. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity was common
despite supportive treatment with G-CSF, and grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurred without G-CSF. We observed
no graft toxicity during chemotherapy. Patient 1 died from
sepsis after complications of retransplantation for transplant cirrhosis 15 years after undergoing liver transplantation and 3 years after successful treatment of PTLD.
Second-line therapy, however, was associated with a TRM
rate of 50% (2 of 4 patients: hemorrhage secondary to pancytopenia after HD cytarabine and pneumonia after
CHOP-21 and irradiation) (see Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Our case series confirms Burkitt-PTLD as a rare form of
adult PTLD, constituting only 3% of the PTLD patients
reported to our registry and the PTLD-1 trial. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis (5.7 years) in
our series also confirmed the results from previous case series of adult Burkitt-PTLD20 (4.5 years) and pediatric
Burkitt-PTLD21 (4.3 years) and is nearly identical to the
5.5 years we observed in patients with DLBCL-PTLD.7
Other rare forms of PTLD, such as plasmacytoma-like
PTLD24 and plasmablastic PTLD,25 manifest later (median, 8.3 years and 12.8 years, respectively). The clinical
features of Burkitt-PTLD are similar to those of BL in the
nontransplantation population,2 including frequent early
CNS relapse with poor response to subsequent therapy.26
We can also confirm the high rate of latent EBV infection

in Burkitt-PTLD compared with sporadic BL and immunodeficiency-associated BL (63% in our series; 82% in
the pediatric Burkitt-PTLD series21).
The excellent response to and long-term survival
after immunochemotherapy with rituximab and CHOP
or R-CHOP in Burkitt-PTLD, however, may seem
surprising. Because of the success of intensive treatment
protocols,12 published data for direct comparison with
R-CHOP in BL are limited. Historically, a 53% CR
rate (5-year OS, 23%) for CHOP with systemic and intrathecal methotrexate27 and a 50% CR rate (projected
relapse-free survival, 62.5%) for a cyclophosphamideincreased, CHOP-like protocol plus systemic and
intrathecal methotrexate28 have been reported in 2 small
studies that included 13 patients and 8 patients, respectively. In contrast, an abstract that was presented at the
2006 American Society of Hematology meeting29
reported a CR/unconfirmed CR rate of 100% and an OS
rate of 100% after a median potential follow-up of 28
months with the DA-EPOCH protocol (combined etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin)30 plus systemic rituximab and intrathecal
methotrexate in 17 patients with BL. A potential explanation for the excellent outcome with sequential immunochemotherapy in PTLD may be the additional effect of
IR.31
CRs have been reported in adult Burkitt-PTLD
with treatment ranging from IR plus rituximab monotherapy to IR plus high-dose protocols, such as ProMace/
CytaBom (combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
etoposide, cytozar, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate,
and prednisone) or the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
9251 protocol.20 However, the latter approach is associated with significant mortality in adults (60%),19 and the
complications observed in pediatric Burkitt-PTLD by
Picarsic et al also support our reservations regarding intensive therapy, because 2 of 4 patients who had received
cytarabine died of therapy complication and graft (liver)
failure, respectively.21
In contrast, our data support the idea that sequential
therapy is sufficient to treat Burkitt-PTLD, thus eliminating the risks associated with more aggressive chemotherapy regimens. The sequential combination of rituximab
and CHOP chemotherapy has achieved a response rate of
100% without TRM in 5 prospectively analyzed patients.
Only 1 of those 5 patients suffered a relapse. Furthermore,
the addition of rituximab to CHOP significantly lowered
the risk of secondary CNS disease compared with historic
controls who received CHOP alone. The value of additional intrathecal prophylaxis in patients with Burkitt4723
