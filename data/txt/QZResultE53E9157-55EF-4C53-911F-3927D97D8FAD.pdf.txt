ABSTRACT
Considerable evidence from both clinical and experimental studies suggests
that androgen receptor variants, particularly androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7),
are critical in the induction of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. In this
study, we investigated the role of AR-V7 in the cross-resistance of enzalutamide
and abiraterone and examined if inhibition of AR-V7 can improve abiraterone
treatment response. We found that enzalutamide-resistant cells are cross-resistant
to abiraterone, and that AR-V7 confers resistance to abiraterone. Knock down of
AR-V7 by siRNA in abiraterone resistant CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells restored
their sensitivity to abiraterone, indicating that AR-V7 is involved in abiraterone
resistance. Abiraterone resistant prostate cancer cells generated by chronic treatment
with abiraterone showed enhanced AR-V7 protein expression. Niclosamide, an FDAapproved antihelminthic drug that has been previously identified as a potent inhibitor
of AR-V7, re-sensitizes resistant cells to abiraterone treatment in vitro and in vivo. In
summary, this preclinical study suggests that overexpression of AR-V7 contributes to
resistance to abiraterone, and supports the development of combination of abiraterone
with niclosamide as a potential treatment for advanced castration resistant prostate
cancer.

dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) to a more active Δ4-abiraterone
(D4A) form which blocks multiple steroidogenic enzymes
and antagonizes the androgen receptor [3]. Abiraterone
treatment in patients who had progressed after docetaxel
therapy demonstrated a 3.9 month survival benefit and
chemotherapy-naïve patients had a 4.4 month survival
benefit with abiraterone [4-6]. It is unfortunate, however,
that one-third of all patients display primary resistance to
abiraterone treatment, and all patients with initial response
progress by 15 months of abiraterone treatment [4].
Although enzalutamide and abiraterone have
achieved significant outcomes in the clinic [4, 7], the
controversy of sequential treatment for late stage prostate
cancer patients remains [8-13]. Moderate effects of
sequential treatment of enzalutamide and abiraterone in
clinical patients revealed the existence of cross resistance
between enzalutamide and abiraterone. This brings to light
an urgent need to identify the cross resistance mechanisms

INTRODUCTION
Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
is characterized by increased activation and/or
overexpression of androgen receptor (AR) resulting in
the transcription of downstream target genes and tumor
progression despite castrate levels of androgen in the
patient. At this stage of prostate cancer progression,
there are currently several agents in use to stop or
reverse tumor growth. Amongst these is abiraterone.
Abiraterone is a steroidogenesis inhibitor of the androgen
synthesis pathway and functions by blocking CYP17A1
activity and preventing the conversion of pregnenolone
to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [1, 2]. This results in
significant loss of androgen production in peripheral
tissues and loss of production of precursors needed for
intratumoral androgen synthesis. Recently, abiraterone
was discovered to be converted by 3β-hydroxysteroid

involved in order to discover biomarkers and treatment
strategies that can overcome the resistance.
Several pathways have been identified which may
play a role in the development of abiraterone resistance,
many of which involve re-activation of androgen synthesis
or changes in androgen receptor signaling [14–18]. Of
interest in the presented study, is the role of androgen
receptor variants. These variants are produced due to
alternative splicing or by genome rearrangement and
oftentimes result in loss of the AR ligand binding domain
leading to constitutive activation of the receptor [19–22]. Of
these variants, androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) is the
most widely studied and its expression is associated with
resistance to multiple therapeutics including enzalutamide
and abiraterone[14, 16, 23–25]. Clinically, Antonarakis et
al. demonstrated that patients treated with enzalutamide
or abiraterone that had AR-V7 expression displayed
significantly lower PSA response, shorter progression-free
and overall survival compared to men without AR-V7 [26].
Niclosamide, an FDA-approved antihelminthic,
has been identified as a potent AR-V7 inhibitor in prostate
cancer cells [27]. Niclosamide promotes AR-V7 protein
degradation, possibly through activation of the ubiquitin
proteasome pathway. Furthermore, it reduces AR-V7
transcriptional activity and reverses enzalutamide resistance
[27, 28]. However, the experimental evidence of the roles of
AR-V7 in the responsiveness to abiraterone treatment and
the effects of niclosamide on abiraterone treatment remain
unknown. In the present study, we found that enzalutamideresistant cells are cross-resistant to abiraterone and that ARV7 promotes abiraterone resistance. Abiraterone resistant
prostate cancer cells generated by chronical treatment with
abiraterone showed significantly enhanced AR-V7 protein
expression. Furthermore, niclosamide treatment sensitized
abiraterone-resistant cells to abiraterone through AR-V7
inhibition. Of particular importance was the finding that
niclosamide was capable of reversing abiraterone resistance
in vivo through the oral administration. This study provides
insight into prostate cancer cross-resistance and demonstrates
a novel therapy for overcoming abiraterone resistance by
niclosamide. Data contained herein are a critical step towards
the development of treatment strategies for patients with
advanced castration resistance prostate cancer.

enzalutamide. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the
differences in response to abiraterone between C4-2B parental
and C4-2B MDVR cells. Both cell lines were treated with
varying concentrations of abiraterone or enzalutamide for 48
hours and cell numbers were determined. As shown in Figure
1B, C4-2B parental cells are sensitive to both abiraterone and
enzalutamide, while C4-2B MDVR cells showed a reduced
response to abiraterone and resistance to enzalutamide.
These results were also confirmed by clonogenic assay. As
depicted in Figure 1C and 1D, abiraterone and enzalutamide
significantly inhibited C4-2B parental cell colony formation
ability while both drugs had limited effects on C4-2B
MDVR cells. Collectively, the above results suggest a cross
resistance phenomenon is present between enzalutamide and
abiraterone.

AR-V7 confers resistance to abiraterone in
prostate cancer
To further examine the sensitivity of prostate cancer
cells to abiraterone, LNCaP, C4-2B and CWR22Rv1 cells
were treated with different concentrations of abiraterone for
48 hours. CWR22Rv1 cells are more resistant to abiraterone
treatment than LNCaP and C4-2B cells (Figure 2A). The
AR-V7 expression was examined by western blot. As shown
in Figure 2B, CWR22Rv1 cells express significantly higher
AR-V7 than LNCaP and C4-2B cells. Previous studies have
shown that AR-V7 might be an important player for driving
enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells [24, 27].
To examine whether it also induces abiraterone resistance,
CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells were transiently
transfected with AR-V7 siRNA and subsequently treated
with 10 μM abiraterone for 3 days. As shown in Figure 2C,
knockdown of AR-V7 significantly enhanced abiraterone
treatment in both CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells. The
effects of AR-V7 knockdown were examined by western
blot (Figure 2D). To determine whether overexpression of
AR-V7 confers resistance to abiraterone, we generated ARV7 overexpressing C4-2 AR-V7 cells by stably expressing
AR-V7 in C4-2 cells. C4-2 neo and C4-2 AR-V7 were
treated with different concentrations of abiraterone for 48
hours and cell numbers were determined. C4-2 AR-V7 cells
exhibited resistance to abiraterone treatment compared to
C4-2 neo cells (Figure 2E). Abiraterone inhibits full length
AR but not AR-V7 expression in C4-2 AR-V7 cells (Figure
2F). These results demonstrate that overexpression of ARV7 confers resistance to abiraterone in prostate cancer cells.

RESULTS
C4-2B MDVR cells are cross resistant to
abiraterone

Niclosamide inhibits AR-V7 expression and
enhances abiraterone treatment in vitro

In present study, we generated enzalutamide resistant
C4-2B MDVR cells [29]. C4-2B MDVR cells have high
expression of AR variants, including AR-V7, compared
to parental C4-2B cells and expression of these variants
cannot be inhibited by either abiraterone or enzalutamide
(Figure 1A). This suggests AR-V7 might be the underlying
mechanism of cross resistance to both abiraterone and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Having demonstrated that AR-V7 also confers
resistance to abiraterone treatment, we next determined
whether niclosamide improves abiraterone treatment by
inhibition of AR-V7 expression in prostate cancer cells.
To examine if niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment

in vitro, CWR22Rv1 or C4-2B MDVR cells were treated
with 0.5 μM niclosamide with or without 10 μM abiraterone
for 2 days and total cell numbers were counted. As shown in
Figure 3A and 3B, 10 μM abiraterone had limited effects on
cell growth, 0.5 μM niclosamide inhibited cell growth, and the
combination treatment significantly inhibited cell growth more
than either treatment on its own. The results were confirmed by
clonogenic assay: combination of niclosamide with abiraterone
significantly inhibited colony number and reduced colony size
in CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells (Figure 3C). Western
blots were performed to determine if combination treatment
with niclosamide and abiraterone inhibit AR-V7 expression.
As shown in Figure 3D, 0.5 μM niclosamide inhibited ARV7 protein expression but had only moderate effects on full
length AR. Combined niclosamide and abiraterone treatment
not only further inhibited AR variants expression, but also
inhibited full length AR expression in both CWR22Rv1 and
C4-2B MDVR cells. Taken together, these results suggest
niclosamide can enhance abiraterone treatment by inhibition
of AR-V7 expression in vitro.

12 months of being cultured in abiraterone acetate containing
medium, C4-2B AbiR (C4-2B abiraterone resistant) cells
developed resistance to abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone
acetate at 5 μM significantly suppressed the growth of C42B parental cells, but had limited effects on C4-2B AbiR
cells. We then examined the AR-V7 levels in C4-2B AbiR
cells. As shown in Figure 4B, C4-2B AbiR cells express
significantly higher levels of AR-V7 protein compared to
C4-2B parental cells. Knock down of AR-V7 expression
significantly re-sensitized C4-2B AbiR cells to abiraterone
acetate (Figure 4C). To find out if niclosamide could enhance
abiraterone treatment in C4-2B AbiR cells, C4-2B AbiR cells
were treated with DMSO, 5 μM abiraterone acetate, 0.5 μM
niclosamide or their combination for 48 hours. Niclosamide
significantly suppressed cell growth in C4-2B AbiR cells,
while combination treatment further enhanced the effects
(Figure 4D). The results were also confirmed by clonogenic
assay (Figure 4E). Niclosamide significantly inhibited ARV7 expression, combination of abiraterone and niclosamide
further suppressed both full-length AR and AR-V7 expression
in C4-2B AbiR cells (Figure 4F).

C4-2B abiraterone resistant cells generated by
chronic treatment with abiraterone showed
enhanced expression of AR-V7

Niclosamide synergizes abiraterone treatment
in vivo through the oral administration
To test the combination effects in vivo, a CWR22Rv1
xenograft model was used. Mice were treated with
abiraterone acetate, niclosamide or their combination
through oral administration. As shown in Figure 5A–5D,

To further examine that AR-V7 confers abiraterone
resistance, we generated an abiraterone resistant prostate
cancer cell line by continuous culture of C4-2B cells in media
containing abiraterone acetate. As shown in Figure 4A, after

CWR22Rv1 tumors were resistant to abiraterone and
treatment with niclosamide alone inhibited tumor growth.
However, combination of niclosamide with abiraterone
synergistically inhibited tumor size and tumor weight without
decreasing mouse body weights. The cell proliferation rate
of tumor samples was analyzed by IHC for Ki67 expression.
Niclosamide inhibited Ki67 expression while combination
treatment with abiraterone further decreased Ki67 expression
(Figure 5E). These data demonstrate that niclosamide
synergizes with abiraterone treatment in abiraterone resistant
CWR22Rv1 tumor models through oral administration, and
suggest that inhibiting AR-V7 with niclosamide is a potent
treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer.

Abiraterone inhibits CYP17A1 and reduces
circulating androgen levels that activate the full length
AR. A recent report also showed that abiraterone could be
converted to D4A, a more active form which antagonizes
full length AR directly [3]. While AR-V7 overexpression
confers resistance to current anti-androgen therapies, ARV7 is not suppressed by abiraterone. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to develop novel agents that inhibit AR-V7 to
overcome drug resistance. Our previous studies identified
niclosamide as a potent inhibitor of AR-V7, and found
that it significantly enhances enzalutamide treatment both
in vitro and in vivo [27]. Niclosamide is an FDA approved
drug for the treatment of human tapeworm infection and
has rich repository of pharmacokinetic data [34-36].
Niclosamide has been proven to be safe and has very
low toxicity in patients [37-41], and therapeutic blood
concentrations can be achieved through oral administration
using FDA approved administration dose. In the present
study, we showed that niclosamide enhanced abiraterone
treatment through oral administration in prostate
cancer xenograft model, suggesting the combination of
niclosamide and abiraterone warrants clinical investigation
to treat advanced prostate cancer patients.
Taken together, we found that AR-V7 is involved
in the cross resistance of enzalutamide and abiraterone.
Targeting AR-V7 by siRNA or inhibition of protein
expression by niclosamide can significantly enhance
abiraterone treatment in vitro and in vivo. These data
support the combination of abiraterone and niclosamide
as a potential treatment for advanced prostate cancer.

DISCUSSION
Since abiraterone and enzalutamide were approved
by the FDA, the great potential to extend the lives and
improve the quality of advanced prostate cancer patients
is on horizon. Unfortunately, resistance to abiraterone
and enzalutamide occurs frequently and there is still no
definitive cure for metastatic CRPC patients. Considerable
evidence from both clinical and experimental studies
suggests that androgen receptor variants, particularly ARV7, play vital roles in the development of resistance to
enzalutamide as well as abiraterone therapy [14, 16, 2326]. In the present study, we demonstrated that AR-V7
confers resistance to abiraterone and that niclosamide,
a previously identified potent inhibitor of AR-V7,
re-sensitizes resistant cells to abiraterone treatment.
Furthermore, niclosamide synergizes with abiraterone
treatment both in vitro and in vivo.
Both abiraterone and enzalutamide are FDA
approved drugs. When prostate cancer becomes resistant
to one drug, the subsequent response rate to the other drug
is 20% or less [8, 30, 31], suggesting cross-resistance
exists between these two drugs. However, the underlying
mechanisms are incompletely understood. The role
of AR splice variants in CRPC has been functionally
characterized in recent years due to their prevalence in
advanced prostate cancer tissues [21, 32, 33]. Truncated
AR variants including AR-V7 have been suggested to drive
castration resistant growth and AR target genes expression
leading to resistance to enzalutamide [23, 24]. In the
present study, we showed that cells which are resistant
to enzalutamide are also resistant to abiraterone, and that
AR-V7 overexpression confers resistance to abiraterone.
Chronic treatment of C4-2B cells with abiraterone
significantly induced AR-V7 protein expression; while
overexpression of AR-V7 in C4-2 cells drives these cells
become resistant to abiraterone. Knock down of AR-V7
expression by siRNA in CWR22Rv1, C4-2B MDVR and
C4-2B AbiR cells significantly restored their sensitivity
to abiraterone treatment, suggesting that AR-V7 plays an
important role in the development of abiraterone resistance
in addition to enzalutamide resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell culture
LNCaP, C4-2, C4-2B and CWR22Rv1 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1
mg/ml streptomycin. C4-2-neo and C4-2 AR-V7 cells
were generated by stable transfection of C4-2 cells with
either empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 encoding
AR-V7 and were maintained in RPMI1640 medium
containing 300 μg/mL G418. C4-2B MDVR (C4-2B
enzalutamide resistant) cells were described previously
[29]. C4-2B MDVR cells were maintained in 20 μM
enzalutamide containing medium. C4-2B AbiR (C4-2B
abiraterone resistant) cells were cultured in 5-20 μM
abiraterone acetate over 12 months and maintained in 10
μM abiraterone acetate containing medium. All cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5%
carbon dioxide.

Plasmids transfection and luciferase assay
For small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection,
cells were seeded at a density of 1×105 cells per well in
32217

In vivo tumorigenesis assay

12-well plates or 3×105 cells per well in 6-well plates and
transfected with siRNA (Dharmacon) targeting the ARV7 sequence (GUAGUUGUAAGUAUCAUGA) [42] or
a control siRNA targeting the luciferase (Luc) gene, nontargeting siRNA control (CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA),
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

CWR22Rv1 cells (4 million) were mixed with
matrigel (1:1) and injected subcutaneously into the
flanks of 6-7 week male SCID mice. Tumor-bearing
mice (tumor volume around 50-100 mm3) were
randomized into four groups (5 mice each group) and
treated as follows: (1) vehicle control (0.5% weight/
volume (w/v) Methocel A4M through oral), (2)
Abiraterone acetate (200 mg/kg, through oral), (3)
Niclosamide (500 mg/kg, through oral), (4) Abiraterone
acetate (200 mg/kg, through oral) + Niclosamide
(500 mg/kg, through oral). Tumors were measured
using calipers twice a week and tumor volumes were
calculated using length × width2/2. Tumor tissues were
harvested after 3 weeks of treatment.

Western blot analysis
Cellular protein extracts were resolved on SDS–
PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking for 1 hour at room temperature
in 5% milk in PBS/0.1% Tween-20, membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with the indicated primary
antibodies [AR441, (SC-7305, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA); AR-V7 (AG10008, Precision antibody);
Tubulin (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)]. Tubulin
was used as loading control. Following secondary
antibody incubation, immunoreactive proteins were
visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) [43].

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were fixed by formalin and paraffin
embedded. Tissue sections were dewaxed, rehydrated,
and blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen
retrieval was performed in sodium citrate buffer (0.01
mol/L, pH 6.0) in a microwave oven at 1,000 W for 3
min and then at 100 W for 20 min. Nonspecific antibody
binding was blocked by incubating slides in 10% fetal
bovine serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
Slides were then incubated with anti-Ki-67 (at 1:500;
NeoMarker) at room temperature for 30 min. Slides
were then washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 30 min, followed by incubation
with avidin DH-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase
complex for 30 min (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector
Laboratories). The sections were developed with the
diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) and
counterstained with hematoxylin. Nuclear staining of
cells was scored and counted in 5 different areas of the
tissue section. Images were taken with an Olympus BX51
microscope equipped with DP72 camera.

Cell growth assay
C4-2B parental or C4-2B MDVR cells were seeded
on 12-well plates at a density of 1×105 cells/well in
RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS and treated with
varying concentrations of abiraterone or enzalutamide
for 48 hours; C4-2 neo, C4-2 AR-V7, LNCaP, C4-2B or
CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with varying concentrations
of abiraterone for 48 hours; CWR22Rv1, C4-2B MDVR
or C4-2B AbiR cells were transiently transfected with
siRNA targeting AR-V7 or a control siRNA, followed
by treatment with abiraterone for 3 days. CWR22Rv1
cells, C4-2B MDVR or C4-2B AbiR cells were seeded
on 12-well plates at a density of 0.5×105 cells/well in
RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS and co-treated
with niclosamide and abiraterone in media containing
FBS for 2 days. Total cell numbers were counted and the
cell survival rate (%) was calculated. Cell survival rate
(%) = (Treatment group cell number / Control group cell
number) ×100%.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means ± standard deviation
of the mean (SD). Statistical analyses were performed
with Microsoft Excel analysis tools. Differences between
individual groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by the Scheffé procedure for
comparison of means. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Clonogenic assay
C4-2B parental or C4-2B MDVR cells were treated
with DMSO, 5 μM, 10 μM or 20 μM abiraterone, or 10
μM or 20 μM enzalutamide in media containing 10%
complete FBS. CWR22Rv1 cells, C4-2B MDVR or C4-2B
AbiR cells were treated with niclosamide with or without
abiraterone. Cells were plated at equal densities (2000
cells/dish) in 100 mm dishes for 14 days; the medium was
changed every 7 days. The colonies were rinsed with PBS
before staining with 0.5% crystal violet/4% formaldehyde
for 30 min and the numbers of colonies were counted as
described previously [44].
