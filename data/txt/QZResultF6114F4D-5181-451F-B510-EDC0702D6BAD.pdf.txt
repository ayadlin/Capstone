BACKGROUND. Despite advances in drug therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) in blast crisis remains poor. Imatinib has demonstrated synergistic effects
in vitro with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine.

METHODS. A Phase I/II trial was performed in patients with CML myeloid blast crisis. Patients were treated with imatinib þ mitoxantrone/etoposide in four cohorts:
mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2/day and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day for 2 or 3 consecutive
days and imatinib 600 mg/day from Day 15 (cohorts 1 and 2) or from Day 1 (cohorts
3 and 4). After hematologic reconstitution after the cytopenic phase, cytarabine was
given at a dose of 10 mg/m2/day in addition to imatinib as maintenance treatment.
RESULTS. A total of 16 patients were available for analysis, median age 59 years (range,
37–74). All patients who received more intensive induction treatment (cohorts 3 and 4,
n ¼ 7) achieved a hematologic response (HR). In contrast, HR was achieved in only 6

(CML), a clonal neoplastic disorder of the hematopoietic stem
cell. The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, an
abnormality of chromosome 22, that results from a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) and leads to the expression of the BCRtance in collecting the data. We thank Marlies

ABL fusion protein with constitutively deregulated tyrosine kinase activity.
Blast crisis is traditionally defined as the presence of
30% or more blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow
or extramedullary infiltrates of leukemic cells (other
than the spleen or liver). This definition is still commonly used in major clinical trials,1 although according
to the latest WHO classification the blast count defining
blast crisis is 20% or more.2 In the majority of cases the
blasts are of myeloid or undifferentiated origin. In about
one-third of cases the blasts originate from lymphoid
lineages (predominantly B-cell lineage). In most patients
blast crisis is preceded by a chronic phase and a transitional stage, termed accelerated phase.
There is no standard therapy for blast crisis. The
median survival in lymphoid blast crisis after treatment with regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
ranges from 9 to 12 months.3 The outcome of myeloid blast crisis treated with cytarabine-based regimens for acute myeloid leukemia is reported to be
even worse, with a median survival of 3 to 5 months.4
The only curative treatment option for myeloid blast
crisis is allo-SCT. However, cures are rare, with less
than 10% of patients achieving a durable remission.
Pretransplantation induction therapy leading to a
remission of blast crisis or return to chronic phase is
associated with improved transplantation outcome.5
Imatinib is a rationally designed selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. In a Phase II trial
monotherapy with imatinib induced a hematologic
response (HR) in about 50% of patients with myeloid
blast crisis and showed a favorable safety profile. The
most common complications leading to discontinuation of treatment (about 5% of treated patients) are
cytopenia, exanthemas, or gastrointestinal reactions.6
The combination of imatinib with mitoxantrone,
etoposide, or cytarabine was shown to be additive to
highly synergistic in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias in
preclinical studies by several investigators, including
our group.7,8 A combination of chemotherapy with
imatinib is expected to result in a better leukemia
load reduction and may be a strategy to delay or offset clonal selection of resistant leukemia cells. We
initiated a Phase I/II trial for patients with CML myeloid blast crisis to investigate the safety and efficacy
of an imatinib-based combination treatment regimen. Patients who responded to induction treatment
and who had a matched donor received an allo-SCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Male and female patients at least 18 years of age
were eligible for participation in this study if they

had BCR-ABL-positive CML myeloid blast crisis and
had given written informed consent to participate in
the trial before study entry. The study was approved
in all participating centers by local ethics committees
and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. CML blast crisis was defined as at
least 30% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral
blood or extramedullary blast infiltration. The presence of a myeloid phenotype had to be confirmed
by flow cytometry9 and cytochemistry required positivity for standard myeloid markers and myeloperoxidase. To differentiate myeloid blast crisis from
biphenotypic leukemia or lymphoid blast crisis the
European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemia scoring system was used.10
The patients were required to be free of marked
liver or kidney disease as indicated by levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin not higher than 3 times the
upper limit of normal, and serum creatinine levels
not higher than twice the upper limit of normal.
Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
2 or lower and were excluded from the trial if they
had any serious concomitant medical condition.
Prior treatment for blast phase of CML was allowed.
Patient characteristics are given in Table 1.

Study Design
Patients were treated in four cohorts: cohort 1,
mitoxantrone and etoposide on Days 1-2, imatinib
from Day 15; cohort 2, mitoxantrone and etoposide
on Days 1-3, imatinib from Day 15; cohort 3, mitoxantrone and etoposide on Days 1-2, imatinib from
Day 1; cohort 4, mitoxantrone and etoposide on
Days 1-3, imatinib from Day 1.
Drug dosages were mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 intravenous daily, etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenous daily,
and imatinib 600 mg orally daily. After recovery of
neutrophil (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >1.5
3 109/L) and platelet counts (>100 3 109/L) and
achievement of a hematologic remission a maintenance treatment with cytarabine 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily was initiated. Imatinib was administered
continuously and throughout the cytopenic phase.
Evaluation
Patients were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic response and recurrence at specified intervals.
Peripheral blood samples were obtained and analyzed at baseline, at least 3 times a week in the first
3 weeks, then at least weekly for the next 3 months
and every 4 weeks thereafter.

Bone marrow aspirates for morphologic and
cytogenetic evaluation were done at screening and
after hematologic recovery or in case of prolonged
cytopenia on Day 28. Consecutive aspirates were
done at weeks 8 and 12 and every 3 months thereafter.
Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were
assessed according to National Cancer Institute
(NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) common
toxicity criteria (CTC). The duration of grade 3–4
cytopenia, the number of transfused red cell and platelet concentrates, neutropenic fever, and the duration of intravenous antibiotic and antifungal treatment
were documented.
Complete HR was defined as normalization of
peripheral blood counts and differentials (ANC >1.0
3 109/L, white blood cell [WBC] of 2.0 to 10.0 3 109/
L, and platelet counts of >100 3 109/L) with 5%
blasts in bone marrow smears for at least 4 weeks,
no palpable splenomegaly, with no evidence of extramedullar involvement.
Cytogenetic response was based on the prevalence of Ph-positive metaphases among at least 20
metaphases investigated in each bone marrow sample and was defined as complete (0% Ph-positive
metaphases), partial (1%–35%), minor (36%-65%),
minimal (66%–95%), or none (>95%).11
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RQ-PCR) for BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts was performed in 9 of 16 patients. Real-time PCR was carried out using the LightCycler technology (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as described.12
The numbers of total ABL transcripts were determined as internal standards in all samples in order
to adjust for different qualities of RNA and cDNA
and to exclude negative results derived from samples
of poor quality. The final results were calculated as
the ratios BCR-ABL/ABL and expressed as percentages.
Overall survival was calculated from the time of
the start of the study treatment to the date of death.
Survival was censored at the last recorded contact or
evaluation for patients alive at the time of analysis.

Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to investigate the safety of
the combination treatment regimen in an intensityescalation setting. Safety results are reported for all
enrolled patients who received the study medication.
Duration of severe leukopenia (WBC <1 3 109/L),
antibiotic treatment, and the number of transfused
packed red cells and platelet concentrates were used
as primary endpoints for toxicity. The differences in
toxicity profiles depending on treatment group were

assessed for statistical significance using a Student
t-test.
In a second step the efficacy of the study treatment was assessed. Survival was computed using
standard Kaplan-Meier methods with SPSS software
v. 13 (Munich, Germany). The association of treatment modalities with survival was assessed using the
log-rank test. P  .05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patients and Treatment
Eighteen patients were included in the study. For 1
patient no follow-up data are available. The diagnosis
of myeloid blast crisis of another patient was later revised as lymphatic blast crisis and this patient was
therefore excluded from further analysis. Data from
16 patients could be evaluated, 8 men and 8 women.
Eight patients were treated in cohort 1, 1 patient in
cohort 2, 2 patients in cohort 3, and 5 patients in
cohort 4. The overall median age was 60 years
(range, 37–75). At diagnosis of blast crisis the median
age of the patients treated in cohorts 1 and 2 (n ¼ 9)
was close to the median age of the patients in
cohorts 3 and 4 (n ¼ 7): 60 years (range, 43–75) vs
60 years (range, 37–75).
The median time from diagnosis of CML to
inclusion into the study was 5 months (range, 1–23.6
months). Five patients had received prior treatment
for blast crisis, consisting of cytarabine-based chemotherapy. One patient was previously treated with
imatinib for chronic phase disease.
Six patients (2 patients in each of cohorts 1, 3,
and 4) received allo-SCT after achieving HR with or
without platelet recovery >100 3 109/L, at a median
of study treatment duration of 111.5 days (range, 64–
214). The median age of the patients who received
allo-SCT was 48.4 years (range, 37–54), the median
age of the remaining patients was 62 years (range,
46–75), P ¼ .02.
Safety
The induction treatment with mitoxantrone and etoposide in combination with imatinib was well tolerated by most patients. During the cytopenic phase
the patients required a median of 5 (range, 2–18) red
blood cell concentrates, a median of 3.5 (range, 1–8)
platelet concentrates, and therapeutic antibiotic
treatment for a median of 10 (range, 0–38) days. Of
note, CTC grade 3 or 4 mucositis did not occur.
Patients who received imatinib on Day 1 (cohorts 3
and 4) had a significantly longer duration of severe
leukopenia (WBC <1/nL): median of 19 days (range,

Imatinib and Chemotherapy for CML-BC/Fruehauf et al.

1547

0–23) vs 2 days (range, 0–14), P ¼ .015. Interestingly,
neutropenic fever and the duration of antibiotic
treatment were not increased in cohorts 3 and 4.
Two treatment-related deaths occurred, 1 due to
severe pneumonia (cohort 4) and another due to an
intracranial hemorrhage during the cytopenic phase
(cohort 1). The treatment-related mortality (TRM)
rate of 12.5% (2 of 16 patients) observed in this study
is similar to TRM rates observed with intensive
chemotherapy alone reported by others.4

Efficacy
The median overall survival was 6.4 months (Fig. 1),
which is similar to the results reported for imatinib
alone in myeloid blast crisis.1 HR with normalization
of WBC count and differentials and reduction of
bone marrow blasts to <5%, was observed in 6 of 9
patients (67%) in cohorts 1 and 2 and in 7 of 7
(100%) patients in cohorts 3 and 4, indicating a
higher efficacy of the more intensive treatment regimen. Two of 9 patients in cohorts 1 and 2 and 4 of 7
patients in cohorts 3 and 4 could be allogeneically
transplanted later.
Out of 10 patients who received no allo-SCT, 1 is
still alive and in a complete cytogenetic remission
48.5 months after study entry (cohort 1). In this
patient a molecular remission was achieved after 3
months of study treatment and was sustained until
the timepoint of the most recent PCR examination at
low levels of residual disease (Month 45, ratio BCRABL/ABL 0.0062%). The treatment-related causes of
death in 2 patients were mentioned above. Seven
patients died of progressive disease: 4 patients in
cohort 1, 1 patient each in cohorts 2, 3, and 4. A
comparison of the overall survival of patients in the
different treatment intensity cohorts who did not
receive an allo-SCT did not reveal an overall survival
advantage in cohorts 3 and 4 despite a better initial
response: median survival 4.7 months (range, 2–14)
in cohorts 3 and 4 and 4.7 months (range, 0–50) in
cohorts 1 and 2.
Three of the 6 transplanted patients are still alive
and in complete cytogenetic remission at 16, 30, and
31 months after study entry (9, 23, and 28 months
after allo-SCT, respectively). The 6 transplanted
patients were distributed equally in cohorts 1, 3, and
4. Two patients who were in complete molecular
remission died because of transplant-related complications (infection and graft-vs-host disease [GVHD],
11 and 12 months after allo-SCT, respectively). One
patient who never achieved a molecular response
succumbed to recurrence 1.5 months after transplantation. Of the 3 patients still alive, 2 patients were
treated in cohort 4 and 1 in cohort 3.

FIGURE 1. Overall survival of all patients (n ¼ 16). Four patients are still
alive (censored events) and in complete cytogenetic remission, 1 of them on
conventional treatment only (48.5 months after study entry), 3 patients postallogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) (15.6, 30.2, 30.6 months after
study entry). Median survival was 6.4 months (range, 0.348.5 months).

For 2 of 3 patients still alive the molecular
response data are available. They achieved a complete molecular response that was sustained at
Months 24 and 27 (timepoint of the most recent PCR
examination).
The median survival of the transplanted patients
was 15.7 months (range, 4–31) as compared with 4.7
months (range, 0–49) in the group that received conventional treatment alone, P ¼ .067 (log-rank test;
Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
The combination of mitoxantrone/etoposide and
imatinib is well tolerated even in older patients with
generally mild nonhematologic toxicity. The hematologic toxicity was difficult to assess because of different levels of pretreatment myelosuppression. More
aggressive treatment (cohorts 3 and 4) was associated with longer duration of cytopenia. Interestingly, no increase in infectious complications could
be observed. Of the 16 evaluable patients, 2 (12.5%)
died because of myelosuppression-associated complications after the induction treatment, which is
comparable with induction mortality rates reported
in the literature for patients with myeloid blast crisis
treated with chemotherapy alone.1,4 All patients who
received the more intensive induction treatment
(cohorts 3 and 4, n ¼ 7) achieved an HR. In contrast,
HR was achieved in only 6 of 9 patients treated in
cohorts 1 and 2. Aggressive combination induction

Because mutations of the BCR-ABL tyrosine
kinase domain are a common cause for imatinib resistance and disease progression, induction treatment of blast crisis based on combinations with
newer, more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors
such as nilotinib,15 dasatinib,16 and others17 is warranted.
New concepts are also needed for initially
responding patients without a suitable donor. Here a
consolidation with myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is a feasible approach. Clinical trials are
needed to evaluate this concept.

FIGURE 2. Comparison of overall survival from start of study treatment of
patients with (n ¼ 6) and without (n ¼ 10) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Patients in the allo-SCT group showed a trend to superior
survival of median 15.7 months (range, 431 months) vs median of
4.7 months (range, 049) in the rest of the patients; P ¼ .067.

treatment is important to achieve effective reduction
of the malignant clone and to assure a better outcome after allo-SCT. Three of 6 (50%) transplanted
patients are still in complete cytogenetic remission
about 16 to 31 months after initiation of study treatment (9 to 28 months after transplantation) and have
a sustained complete molecular response. In our
trial, patients who received more aggressive treatment including allo-SCT had a longer survival.
Our trial was initiated several years ago when
imatinib did not have approval for general clinical
use; therefore, the majority of patients who entered
our trial were imatinib-naive. However, 2 patients
had documented prior imatinib treatment for CML
chronic or accelerated phase. Both of these patients
responded to the imatinib-based combination treatment. However, 1 patient experienced recurrence
and died 5 months later of disease progression in
spite of second-line chemotherapy. Another patient
remained in remission and received an allogeneic
transplant 7 months after entering the study. This
patient is still alive. Because most patients nowadays
receive imatinib treatment for chronic phase, the
response to imatinib-based combination treatment
in blast crisis may differ from the response rates
observed in our study. In cases of partial resistance
to imatinib, combination treatment including imatinib is feasible because synergistic effects take
place.13,14 In our opinion, the data presented here
support the recommendation for imatinib-based
induction treatment in patients diagnosed with CML
in myeloid blast crisis.
