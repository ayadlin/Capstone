Abstract
Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and activation of the Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway increases mRNA translation, increases levels of the
antiapoptotic protein FLIPS, and confers resistance to tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–
induced apoptosis in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In
PTEN-deficient GBM cells, however, the FLIPS protein also
exhibited a longer half-life than in PTEN mutant GBM cells,
and this longer half-life correlated with decreased FLIPS
polyubiquitination. FLIPS half-life in PTEN mutant GBM cells
was reduced by exposure to an Akt inhibitor, but not to
rapamycin, suggesting the existence of a previously undescribed, mTOR-independent linkage between PTEN and the
ubiquitin-dependent control of protein stability. Total levels of
the candidate FLIPS E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-interacting
protein 4 (AIP4) were comparable in PTEN wild-type (WT) and
PTEN mutant GBM cells, although in PTEN-deficient cells,
AIP4 was maintained in a stable polyubiquitinated state that
was less able to associate with FLIPS or with the FLIPScontaining death inducing signal complex. Small interfering
RNA–mediated suppression of AIP4 levels in PTEN WT cells
decreased FLIPS ubiquitination, prolonged FLIPS half-life, and
increased TRAIL resistance. Similarly, the Akt activation that
was previously shown to increase TRAIL resistance did not
alter AIP4 levels, but increased AIP4 ubiquitination, increased
FLIPS steady-state levels, and suppressed FLIPS ubiquitination. These results define the PTEN-Akt-AIP4 pathway as a key
regulator of FLIPS ubiquitination, FLIPS stability, and TRAIL
sensitivity and also define a novel link between PTEN and the
ubiquitin-mediated control of protein stability. [Cancer Res

(1, 2). Although many cancer cells are preferentially sensitive to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis, the sensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain cancer, is variable,
and most short-term primary GBM cultures are TRAIL insensitive
(3, 4). Although many factors contribute to TRAIL resistance in
GBM, the levels of FLIPS, a truncated splice variant of FLIP, have
been shown to be of particular importance (5, 6). Levels of FLIPS in
TRAIL-resistant cells have in turn been shown to be regulated by the
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-Akt-mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and PTEN loss and Akt activation
correlate in vitro, in human GBM xenografts, and in primary human
GBM samples with increased FLIPS mRNA translation, high levels of
FLIPS expression, and TRAIL resistance (5).
In the process of completing studies related to the PTENdependent translational regulation of FLIPS, we noted that the high
amounts of FLIPS in PTEN-defective TRAIL resistant GBM cells
were also associated with a greatly prolonged half-life of the protein.
Protein stability is frequently regulated by ubiquitination, a process
by which the small protein ubiquitin is covalently attached to lysine
residues in target proteins by E3 ubiquitin ligases (7, 8). Whereas the
ligation of a single ubiquitin molecule at one or multiple lysines in
the target protein (monoubiquitination) can change target protein
activity and cellular location, chain-like addition of multiple
ubiquitin molecules to the sites of monoubiquitination (at lysines
48 or 63 in ubiquitin itself; polyubiquitination) leads to alterations
in protein sorting and activity (K63 polyubiquitination) or, more
critically, to degradation of the targeted protein (K48 polyubiquitination; refs. 9, 10). Although PTEN has not, to date, been reported to
regulate the ubiquitination process, the association between PTEN
status and FLIPS stability suggested that PTEN may use regulation
of ubiquitination, in addition to regulation of protein production, to
control the levels of FLIPS and TRAIL sensitivity. In the present
study, we explored this possibility.

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is a proapoptotic peptide that binds to the death receptors
DR4/DR5 and induces formation of the death-inducing signaling
complex and engagement of the type I extrinsic apoptotic pathway

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and manipulation. Flank xenografts of individual human
GBM were established in mice as previously described (5). Freshly resected
xenograft material was then obtained from the UCSF Brain Tumor Research
Tissue Bank, dissected into small (<1 mm diameter) pieces, passed through a
100 Am pore size tissue culture sieve, and grown on reduced Matrigel-coated
dishes (Fisher Scientific). Each resultant culture (e.g., 5, 10, 14) is therefore
derived from a unique patient tumor. Transformed mouse astrocytes (TMA)
and GBM xenograft cells (5) were cultured in DMEM (H-21) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were
incubated with vehicle (DMSO), MG132 (10 Amol/L, 24 h), Akt inhibitor III
(50 Amol/L, 24 h; Calbiochem), rapamycin (100 nmol/L, 24 h), or TRAIL
(800 ng/mL, 24 h; Genentech) and, where indicated, with cycloheximide
(100 Ag/mL) or vehicle for an additional 24 to 72 h. Pools of retrovirally
infected or transfected (Lipofectamine) cells (11) were obtained by selection with neomycin (1 mg/mL, 7 d) or hygromycin B (400 Ag/mL, 7 d).

Atrophin-interacting protein 4 (AIP4)–targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA;
300 nmol/L; Ambion, identification no. 120674) or scramble control (300 nmol/L;
silencer negative control #1, Ambion) was transfected, and target protein
levels were analyzed 1 to 3 d after exposure to vehicle or cycloheximide.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Control or hemagglutinin (HA)-ubiquitin–expressing cells were lysed, and AIP4, FLIPS, or
death receptor 5 (DR5) was immunoprecipitated from lysates by incubation
(1 h, 4jC) with the appropriate antibody pre-conjugated to protein-G beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Levels of proteins in the cell lysate and the
eluted immunoprecipitates were assessed by Western blot using the
appropriate antibody. Levels of ubiquitinated protein were assessed by
Western blot using a goat polyclonal antibody against FLIPS (Santa Cruz

Biotechnology) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against AIP4 or HA (Cell
Signaling Technology), followed by detection with antigoat IgG or antirabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using enhanced chemiluminescence.
Densitometric measurements were acquired using an AlphaImager 2200
(Alpha Innotech Corporation). Immunoprecipitations carried out using a
nonspecific normal rabbit IgG antibody ( for AIP4 immunoprecipitations) or
a goat IgG antibody ( for FLIPS immunoprecipitations) were included as
negative controls. Analysis of TRAIL-induced apoptosis was done as
previously described (12).
Statistical analysis. Data presented are representative of at least three
independent experiments. All statistical analyses were done using the
Student t test, with significance defined as P < 0.05 (*).

PTEN-Mediated Control of FLIPS Ubiquitination

Figure 2. AIP4 interacts with FLIPS in a PTEN- and ubiquitin-dependent manner. PTEN WT or mutant cells were transfected with a blank vector or a construct
encoding HA-ubiquitin (C ) or exposed to vehicle (B) or TRAIL (800 ng/mL, 24 h; A). Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for IgG or
for DR5 (A), AIP4 or FLIPS (B), or AIP4 (C ). Lysates and immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis of AIP4 and DR5 (A), FLIPS and
AIP4 (B), and AIP4 and HA-AIP4 (C) levels.

Results and Discussion
We previously showed that PTEN loss causes a mTOR-dependent
increase in the translation of the FLIPS mRNA levels, increased levels
of the antiapoptotic protein FLIPS, and increased TRAIL resistance
(5). In cycloheximide-treated PTEN-deficient GBM xenograft cells
and in cycloheximide-treated TMA derived from PTEN knockout
mouse embryos, however, the half-life of preexisting FLIPS was also
significantly longer than in corresponding PTEN wild-type (WT)
cells (Fig. 1A). Differences in FLIPS protein stability were not due to
effects of cycloheximide on FLIPS mRNA levels (Supplementary
Fig. S1), nor were they an artifact of the low initial levels of FLIPS in
PTEN WT cells because overexpression of FLIPS did not alter FLIPS
half-life (Supplementary Fig. S2). MG132-mediated suppression of
the proteasome, however, greatly prolonged the half-life of the FLIPS
protein in PTEN WT human GBM cells and PTEN WT TMA (Fig. 1B),
suggesting that FLIPS half-life was regulated by protein degradation
in a PTEN-dependent manner. FLIPS immunoprecipitates from
PTEN WT cells transiently transfected with a construct encoding
HA-ubiquitin and subjected to Western blot analysis using a HAtargeted antibody also contained more >28-kDa FLIPS than FLIPS
immunoprecipitates from PTEN mutant cells (Fig. 1C; each
ubiquitin added adds 7 kDa of mass), indicative of increased FLIPS
polyubiquitination and suggesting that the increased FLIPS stability
in PTEN mutant cells resulted from the inability of these cells to
mark FLIPS for proteasomal degradation. Because the PTEN-AktmTOR pathway regulates translation of FLIPS mRNA (5), we
questioned whether the PTEN-associated effects on FLIPS protein
stability were mediated by the same pathway. Incubation of PTENdeficient GBM and TMA cells with an Akt inhibitor suppressed Akt
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3) and significantly shortened FLIPS half-life, although exposure of the cells to concentrations
of rapamycin that suppressed S6 phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S3) did not (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the PTEN-Akt
pathway is linked to the control of FLIPS stability in a novel, Aktdependent but mTOR-independent manner.
To better define the linkage between PTEN loss, Akt activation,
and ubiquitin-mediated regulation of FLIPS stability, we took a
candidate approach and ultimately focused on the E3 ubiquitin

ligase AIP4 (13). Levels of AIP4 were comparable in PTEN WT and
PTEN-deficient cells, although less AIP4 was found in FLIPS
immunoprecipitates from PTEN-deficient cells than from PTENdeficient cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, DR5 immunoprecipitates of the
death-inducing signaling complex (which contains both DR5 and
FLIPS; ref. 14) from TRAIL-treated PTEN mutant GBM cells also
contained less AIP4 than those from PTEN WT cells (Fig. 2B). The
immunoprecipitated AIP4 from PTEN-deficient cells was also
maintained in a more highly polyubiquitinated form than that in
PTEN WT cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that PTEN loss and Akt
activation lead to the generation of a (perhaps K63-) ubiquitinated
AIP4, which, although not less stable, is decreased in its ability to
interact with and ubiquitinate FLIPS.
To more definitively link AIP4 to the control of FLIPS stability
and TRAIL sensitivity, PTEN WT cells were exposed to siRNA
targeting AIP4, after which effects on FLIPS levels, FLIPS
ubiquitination, FLIPS stability, and TRAIL sensitivity were monitored. The siRNA-mediated suppression of AIP4 levels in PTEN
WT cells (Fig. 3A, left) significantly increased the half-life of FLIPS
(Fig. 3A, middle) relative to that noted in cells receiving a
nontargeted siRNA (Fig. 3A, right). increased steady-state levels of
FLIPS (Fig. 3B, bottom), decreased levels of polyubiquitinated FLIPS
(Fig. 3B, top), and increased resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 3C). These results show that AIP4 is directly linked to the
control of FLIPS ubiquitination and stability, and that AIP4 targets
FLIPS for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction.
Finally, to formally establish the role of AIP4 in linking the PTENAkt pathway to the control of FLIPS stability and TRAIL sensitivity,
PTEN WT cells were retrovirally infected with a construct encoding
Akt-ER (15) and incubated with vehicle or 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4HT), after which the known TRAIL-desensitizing effects of 4HTmediated Akt activation were compared with the effects on AIP4
and FLIPS levels and ubiquitination. The 4HT-mediated activation
of Akt-ER in PTEN WT cells (Supplementary Fig. S4) that was
previously shown to increase resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (5) did not alter AIP4 levels (Fig. 4A, bottom), but
significantly increased the extent of AIP4 polyubiquitination
(Fig. 4A, top), suppressed levels of FLIPS ubiquitination (Fig. 4B, top),

and increased levels of total FLIPS (Fig. 4B, top). Taken as a whole,
these results show the existence of a novel pathway that links PTEN
to the control of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
The pathway that links PTEN to the control of FLIPS
ubiquitination described in this work is presented in Fig. 4C. In
this model, PTEN suppresses levels of pAkt (left), which in turn
retains AIP4 in a state in which it can interact with and (likely
K48-) polyubiquitinate FLIPS. K48-polyubiquitinated FLIPS then
undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation, leaving the cell susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Loss of PTEN function (Fig. 4D,
right), in contrast, increases pAkt levels and retains AIP4 in a (perhaps
K63-) polyubiquitinated state in which it can no longer interact
with and target FLIPS for destruction, thereby allowing FLIPS to
accumulate and suppress TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Although the
means by which Akt activation enhances AIP4 ubiquitination are not
clear, many E3 ligases including AIP4 regulate their own ubiquitination (16–18), and Akt may directly modulate this process. Alternatively, because ubiquitination is a reversible process, Akt may interact
with any of a number of deubiquitinases (19), which may in turn tailor

the pattern of AIP4 ubiquitination and serve to regulate AIP4
function. Cell type–specific factors that influence AIP4 ubiquitination
and/or protein interactions may also help explain the ability of AIP4
to target FLIPS in GBM cells, but not other cell types (20).
In light of the present work, PTEN seems to exert coordinate
control on FLIPS, suppressing FLIPS mRNA translation (5) while at
the same time contributing to the destabilization of the protein. This
coordinate system could therefore allow both immediate resetting of
the apoptotic threshold of cells (via rapid regulation of protein
stability) and a more long-term restructuring of apoptotic potential
(via changes in protein translation), and on inactivation (as in a
significant percentage of PTEN-deficient gliomas; ref. 19), it could
allow near-complete inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic response.
Whereas pharmacologic manipulation of either arm of this coordinate pathway could effectively resensitive tumor cells to TRAIL,
manipulation of both arms may ultimately prove most effective. In a
broader sense, the present work also has implications for PTEN
function. It seems unlikely that PTEN has evolved the ability to
regulate ubiquitination solely to control AIP4 activity, FLIPS stability,

Figure 3. AIP4 is linked to the control of FLIPS ubiquitination and stability and TRAIL sensitivity. PTEN WT or mutant cells were transfected with a scrambled
siRNA or siRNA targeting AIP4. Cells were then incubated with vehicle or cycloheximide (A), transfected with a blank vector or a construct encoding HA-ubiquitin (B ),
or exposed to TRAIL (800 ng/mL, 24 h; C ). Cells were then collected at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis of AIP4, FLIPS, and
a-tubulin levels (A and B); immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for FLIPS and subjected to analysis of extent of HA-ubiquitination of FLIPS (B); or analyzed
for extent of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

PTEN-Mediated Control of FLIPS Ubiquitination

Figure 4. AIP4 links the PTEN-Akt pathway to FLIPS ubiquitination and stability. PTEN WT or mutant cells were transfected with a blank construct or a construct
encoding a 4HT-inducible Akt-ER (A and B). Cells were then incubated with vehicle or 4HT (100 Amol/L, 24 h), transfected with a blank vector or a construct encoding
HA-ubiquitin and lysed, then subjected either to Western blot analysis of FLIPS, AIP4, and a-tubulin or to immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for AIP4 or
FLIPS, and then analyzed for the extent of HA-ubiquitination of AIP4 (A ) and FLIPS (B). C, schematic representation of the PTEN-mediated control of FLIPS

and TRAIL sensitivity. Rather, it seems more likely that PTEN may
regulate the activity of many of the more than 1,000 E3 ubiquitin
ligases in the human cell (8) and, in doing so, may control the
stability of a wide range of proteins critical in regulating the
transformed phenotype. These ideas are currently being investigated.
