ABSTRACT
Most solid tumors contain a subfraction of cells with stem/progenitor
cell features. Stem cells are naturally chemoresistant suggesting that chronic
chemotherapeutic stress may select for cells with increased “stemness”. We
carried out a comprehensive molecular and functional analysis of six independently
selected colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with acquired resistance to three different
chemotherapeutic agents derived from two distinct parental cell lines. Chronic drug
exposure resulted in complex alterations of stem cell markers that could be classified
into three categories: 1) one cell line, HT-29/5-FU, showed increased “stemness” and
WNT-signaling, 2) three cell lines showed decreased expression of stem cell markers,
decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, attenuated WNT-signaling and lost the
capacity to form colonospheres and 3) two cell lines displayed prominent expression
of ABC transporters with a heterogeneous response for stem cell markers. While WNTsignaling could be attenuated in the HT-29/5-FU cells by the WNT-signaling inhibitors
ICG-001 and PKF-118, this was not accompanied by any selective growth inhibitory
effect suggesting that the cytotoxic activity of these compounds is not directly linked
to WNT-signaling inhibition. We conclude that classical WNT-signaling inhibitors have
toxic off-target activities that need to be addressed for clinical development.

sometimes classified as “non-oncogenic” resistance
[8–12]. However, recent findings suggest that chronic
chemotherapeutic stress may promote more general and
often unexpected biological changes in cancer cells. For
example, analysis of biopsies from non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients with acquired resistance to
small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors displayed MET gene amplifications, epithelial to

mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as a transformation
from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer [13]. Exposure of
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to oxaliplatin was associated
with up-regulation of VEGF ligands and receptors [14]
while chronic exposure to irinotecan was accompanied
by activation of EGFR- and SRC-signaling in CRC
models [15].
Most, if not all, solid tumors contain a subpopulation
that displays molecular and functional similarities to stem
cells. Stem cells are naturally chemoresistant due to high
expression of certain ATP-binding cassette transporters,
proficient DNA repair, a slow cell cycle and activation
of various signaling pathways including WNT [16].
Therefore, one potential mechanism of acquired resistance
to chemotherapeutic stress would be selection of cells with
increased “stemness”.
The WNT-signaling pathway plays an important
role in the colon. Starting at the base of the crypt unit,
WNT-signaling is highest in the stem cell compartment
and decreases as the cell moves upwards through the
proliferative areas and into the differentiative compartment
[17]. The central role of WNT signaling is further
emphasized by a recent molecular study of human colon
and rectal cancers indicating that at least 90% of patient
tumors display a deregulated WNT-signaling pathway
[2]. These findings support a role for WNT/beta-cateninsignaling inhibitors as potential novel agents for treatment
of CRC. Assuming that acquired chemoresistance is
accompanied by increased “stemness” and upregulation of
WNT-signaling, such inhibitors might show preferential
activity toward tumors with acquired drug resistance.
To establish the influence of chronic chemotherapeutic
stress on “stemness”, we carried out a comprehensive
molecular and functional analysis of six independently
selected CRC cell lines with acquired resistance to three
chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of
action (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) derived
from two parental cell lines with distinct molecular
profiles, HT-29 (chromosome instable, CIN) and HCT-116
(microsatellite instable, MSI).
We here report that chronic chemotherapeutic stress
drives the evolution of “stemness” in CRC cells in a
complex manner which is relevant for the elaboration of
future therapeutic strategies. In addition, our results reveal
that classical WNT-signaling inhibitors have toxic offtarget activities that need to be addressed for their clinical
development.

are involved in a variety of biological processes. Normal
epithelial cells in the colon express the standard form of
CD44 (CD44s) whereas adenomas, carcinomas and CRC
metastasis may also express CD44 variants (CD44v)
containing additional exons that are coding for insertions in
the membrane-proximal extracellular region [19].
Western blot analysis revealed that the parental
HCT-116 cells predominantly expressed CD44v isoforms
in contrast to the three drug-resistant HCT-116 variants
that almost exclusively expressed CD44s (Figure 1A
upper panel). Parental HT-29 cells expressed exclusively
CD44v isoforms while the oxaliplatin- and SN38-resistant
variants showed increased expression of CD44v as well
as expression of CD44s. In comparison, HT-29/5-FU cells
expressed exclusively CD44s (Figure 1A lower panel).
To confirm that the altered size distribution was linked to
alternative splicing, rather than to potential differences in
glycosylation [20], CD44 mRNA was characterized further
by qRT-PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis
(Figure 1B). The results confirm the differences in size
between CD44 transcripts.
We then focused on CD44 variants containing
exons 3 (CD44v3) and 6 (CD44v6). The CD44v3 isoform
undergoes heparin sulphate modification and is able to
interact with various growth factors including heparinbinding epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast
growth factor [21, 22], whereas the CD44v6 isoform
has been shown to act as a co-receptor for the receptor
tyrosine kinase c-MET [23]. In agreement with the
Western blot analysis, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of
CD44 mRNA using isoform-specific primers for v3 and
v6 showed decreased expression of CD44v3 and CD44v6
in the three drug-resistant HCT-116 cells as well as for
the HT-29/5-FU cells (Figure 1C). In contrast, increased
expression (about 3-fold) was observed for both CD44v3
and CD44v6 in the HT-29/Oxa and HT-29/ SN38 cells.

Differential influence of chronic
chemotherapeutic stress on the expression of
CD133, CD166 and Lgr5
CD133 is a widely used stem cell marker [24]
whereas CD166 and Lgr5 are expressed on the surface
of epithelial cells within the colon stem cell niche [25,
26]. Western blot analysis show that CD133 protein was
strongly expressed by the parental HCT-116 and HT-29
cells as well as by the HT-29/Oxa cells (Figure 2) while
CD133 expression was weak in the HT-29/SN-38 cells and
marginal in drug-resistant HCT-116 variants and HT-29/5FU cells. In clear contrast, Western blot analysis revealed
no alteration in the expression of CD166 among the eight
cell lines (Figure 2). Lgr5 expression was comparable
for HT-29/5-FU cells and slightly downregulated for HT29/Oxa and HT-29/SN38 cells, compared to the parental
cells, whereas Lgr5 expression was marginal for all four
HCT-116 cell lines. Therefore, chronic drug exposure had
divergent influence on the expression of the three stem cell

markers indicating that their expression is not coordinated
in CRC cell lines.

Both HCT-116 and HT-29 parental cells were able to form
uniform and regular colonospheres under these conditions
(Figure 4).
Unexpectedly, the capacity to form colonospheres
was lost for all three drug-resistant HCT-116 variants.
In comparison, HT-29/Oxa and HT-29/SN-38 cells
had retained the capacity to form colonospheres with a
morphology comparable to the parental cells whereas
the 5-FU resistant HT-29 cells formed loose irregular
aggregates with structural similarity to the spheroids
previously described for MDA MB-231 [30] and MCF7sh-WISP2 cells [31].

Chronic chemotherapeutic stress is accompanied
by altered aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
activity
ALDH is considered as a biomarker for the stem
cell/progenitor cell phenotype [27, 28]. Comparison
of the ALDH enzymatic activity by the ALDEFLUOR
assay in the parental and resistant cell lines revealed a
clear decrease in ALDH activity for all three HCT-116
drug-resistant variants that was particularly pronounced
for the HCT-116/Oxa cells. The ALDH activity was also
decreased for the HT-29/Oxa and HT-29/SN-38 cells, in
contrast to the HT-29/5-FU cells where the ALDH activity
was increased (Figure 3). Therefore, most of the drugresistant CRC cells showed decreased ALDH activity
whereas ALDH was upregulated in the HT-29/5-FU cells.

Chronic chemotherapeutic stress has different
influence on the capacity to efflux Hoechst
33342 dye
A characteristic shared by many adult stem cells
as well as some chemo-naive tumor cells is the ability
to efflux Hoechst due to elevated expression of ABC
transporters on the cell surface [32, 33]. The ability to
extrude Hoechst 33342 dye was determined by flow
cytometry analysis (Figure 5A) where the efflux capacity
is considered as the difference in the proportion of cells
present in the side population (SP, outlined in the lower
left corner) in the absence and presence of the non-specific
ABC transporter inhibitor verapamil. The results indicate

accompanied by loss of colonosphere capacity

cells are able to form colonospheres in serum-free media
supplemented with growth factors, when plated in limited
numbers under anchorage-independent conditions [29].

modest modifications of the side population for the two
5-FU-resistant cell lines, compared to the corresponding
parental cells. In contrast, the side population was increased
for oxaliplatin- and SN38-resistant cells as outlined in red,
which is particularly marked for the two HT-29 variants.
We then determined the relative expression
of three drug transporters expressed by SP cells:

ABCB1 (PGP, MDR1), ABCG2 (MRX, BCRP) and
ABCC1 (MRP1) [34] by flow cytometry analysis. The
results show that the expression of ABCB1, ABCG2,
ABCC1 alone or in combination was increased for the
oxaliplatin- and SN-38-resistant variants, whereas the
two 5-FU-resistant cell lines show increased expression
of ABCB1 (Figure 5B).

The expression of stem cell markers and
chemoresistance is not causally linked

WNT-signaling activity was upregulated 12-fold in the
HT-29/5-FU cells.
Activation of the canonical WNT pathway is
generally associated with nuclear accumulation of active,
dephosphorylated β-catenin that has escaped proteasome
degradation. In agreement with the findings shown in
Figures 6A and 6B, Western blot analysis revealed a 6-fold
increase in the expression of the active, unphosphorylated
form of beta-catenin in HT-29/5-FU cells whereas the
expression was either decreased or unchanged for the
other drug-resistant variants (Figure 6C).
The localization of beta-catenin in parental and 5-FU
resistant HT-29 cells was characterized by fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 6D). The results indicate that betacatenin (indicated in red) is predominantly membraneassociated in the parental HT-29 cells but displays a
cytoplasmic/nuclear staining in the HT-29/5-FU cells.
Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin allows complex
formation with the transcription factor T cell factor/
Lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) thereby leading to
transcriptional activation of target genes like Cyclin D1
[37] and Axin 2 [38]. In agreement, the levels of Cyclin
D1 and Axin 2 mRNA, as determined by qRT-PCR,
were increased in the HT-29/5-FU cells but not in the
other drug-resistant variants (Figure 6E). Unexpectedly,
a modest, but reproducible increase in mRNA levels for
cyclin D1 and Axin 2 was observed for the oxaliplatinresistant HCT-116 cells while the 5-FU and SN-38
resistant HCT-116 cells were comparable with the parental
HCT-116 cells.

To explore the link between chemoresistance and the
expression of stem cell markers, the six resistant variants
were maintained in drug-free media for a prolonged
period of time. After more than 6 months (> 50 passages)
we observed no detectable differences in the expression
of stem cell markers for any of the resistant cell lines
(data not shown) whereas the levels of drug resistance
decreased markedly during this interval (Table 1). This
was particularly striking for the HT-29/5-FU cells where
the resistance ratio decreased from 12 to 2. Therefore,
although the chemotherapeutic stress was driving the
evolution of both the drug resistance and the altered
expression of molecular and functional stem cell markers,
the two phenotypes do not appear to be causally linked.

Chronic chemotherapeutic stress modulates
WNT-beta-catenin signaling
WNT pathway activation was determined after
transfection with TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash plasmid
constructs and is expressed in arbitrary units as the
ratio of the TOP/FOP luciferase activity. First, we
evaluated WNT-signaling for the two parental cell lines
in comparison with two reference cell lines, DLD1 and
SW480 that show strong intrinsic WNT-signaling activity
[35, 36]. The results (Figure 6A) indicate modest WNTsignaling activity for both HT-29 and HCT-116 parental
cell lines compared to DLD1 and SW480 cells. Next,
WNT-signaling was compared between parental and
drug-resistant variants. The results (Figure 6B) reveal
that the WNT-signaling activity was decreased for the
three HCT-116 variants which was particularly marked
for the SN-38-resistant cells. WNT-signaling activity
was also downregulated in HT-29/Oxa and HT-29/SN-38
cells, compared to the parental cells. In marked contrast,

The WNT-signaling inhibitors ICG-001 and PKF
118 downregulate WNT-activity without any

to WNT inhibition, we selected two WNT-signaling

inhibitors with different mechanism of action. ICG-001
is a selective low molecular-weight inhibitor, which
antagonize β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription by
specifically binding to CBP (cyclic AMP response
element-binding protein), thereby disrupting the
interaction between CBP and β-catenin [39]. PKF 118–
310 binds selectively to beta-catenin, thereby disrupting
its interaction with TCF-4 [40]. The growth inhibitory
effects of ICG-001 and PKF 118 were determined by
the MTT viability assay after 120 hours continuous
drug exposure [41] and is expressed as IC50 values (drug
concentration inhibiting cell growth by 50% compared
to untreated controls). The IC50 values were around
3 μM for ICG-001 and 0.3 μM for PKF 118 (Figure 7)
in agreement with previous findings [39, 40]. However,
there was no selective cytotoxicity toward either HT-29 or
HT-29/5-FU cells. Similar experiments with DLD-1 and
SW480 cells that are both chemo-naïve and show high
intrinsic WNT-signaling (Figure 6) resulted in similar IC50
values for both ICG-001 and PKF 118 (Figure 7), and this
although the 4 cell lines tested differ almost 40-fold with
respect to Wnt/beta catenin activity (Figure 6A).
To confirm these unexpected findings, the cytotoxic
activities of ICG-001 and PKF 118 toward HT-29, HT-29/5FU, SW480 and DLD-1 cells were determined by the highly
sensitive colony formation assay. The results (SI Figure 1)
show that the cytotoxic activity of PKF 118 was comparable
between the 4 cell lines. For ICG-001, there was up to 3-fold
differences in the cytotoxic activity (IC50 values) between the
most sensitive and the most resistant cell line, but without
any obvious correlation between IC50 value and the WNT/
beta-catenin activity.
To establish if the increased WNT/beta-catenin
activity in the HT-29/5-FU cells was causally related to
5-FU resistance, we determined the influence of 5-FU on
colony formation in the absence or presence of PKF 118
or ICG-001. The results (SI Figure 2) show no influence
of PKF 118 or ICG-001 on the cytotoxic activity of 5-FU
in neither HT-29 nor HT-29/5-FU cells.
We then characterized the influence of ICG-001
and PKF 118 on WNT-signaling in DLD-1, SW480 and

HT- 29/5-FU cells after transfection with TOP-Flash or
FOP-Flash plasmid constructs. The results show that
24 hours exposure to ICG-001 and PKF 118 is associated
with a clear decrease in WNT-signaling (Figure 8).
Taken together, these results show that although
the two WNT signaling inhibitors do indeed inhibit
WNT-signaling within a relevant dose range, this is not
accompanied by any selective cytotoxic effects toward
cells with high levels of WNT signaling.
 

DISCUSSION
Most solid tumors contain a subfraction of cells
with molecular and functional characteristics of stem/
progenitor cells that show intrinsic chemoresistance [16,
42, 43]. This suggests that chronic chemotherapeutic
stress may provide a selective advantage to cells with a
high degree of “stemness”. To explore the link between
chronic chemotherapeutic stress and “stemness”, we
carried out a comprehensive molecular and functional
analysis of six independently selected CRC cell lines with
acquired resistance to three chemotherapeutic agents with
different mechanisms of action (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin
and irinotecan) derived from two parental cell lines with
distinct molecular profiles, HT-29 (chromosome instable,
CIN) and HCT-116 (microsatellite instable, MSI). Since
the expression of stem-cell markers may not be regulated
in a coordinated fashion, we used a battery of four widely
used stem-cell/progenitor markers (CD44, CD133,
CD166 and Lgr5) and three functional tests (aldehyde
dehydrogenase activity, colonosphere formation and
exclusion of Hoechst dye).
Our results show that although chronic
chemotherapeutic stress may indeed be accompanied
by the appearance of cells with increased stemness, the
outcome is more complex than originally proposed.
One cell line, HT-29/5-FU showed a clear increase in
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, increased expression
of the ABC transporter ABCB1 and formed loose cellular
aggregates in serum-free media under low attachment, in
contrast to the parental HT-29 cells that formed regular

spheroids under the same conditions. Therefore, chronic
chemotherapeutic stress was accompanied by increased
“stemness” in these cells.
In contrast, all three drug-resistant HCT-116
variants had lost CD133 expression, displayed decreased
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and had lost the capacity
to form spheroids, suggesting that these cells had either
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

differentiated further or, alternatively, had undergone
trans-differentiation, most likely via EMT (epithelialmesenchymal transition). The latter possibility is
supported by a switch in CD44 isoform expression from
a mixture of CD44v and CD44s isoforms in the parental
cells to CD44s in all three HCT-116 variants, since the
expression of CD44s has been causally linked to the

EMT phenotype in different tumor types including the
colon [44–47]. Interestingly, the HT-29/5-FU cells have
undergone a similar CD44 switch, as shown by strong
expression of the CD44s isoform. In addition, these
cells display an altered morphology, consistent with a
mesenchymal phenotype, as illustrated in Figure 6D.
Besides CD44 isoform switching, the three HCT-116
variants and HT-29/5-FU cells have lost the expression of
CD133. Although CD133 is widely used as an universal
stem-cell marker, recent results suggest that this might not
be applicable for the colon where CD133 is ubiquitously
expressed on differentiated colonic epithelium in
both adult mice and in humans [48]. Interestingly, the
same study reported that CD133+ CRC cells form less
aggressive tumors, which is supported by recent clinical
studies where strong CD133 expression, as determined
by immunohistochemistry, is associated with longer
progression-free survival in patients with metastatic CRC
[49, 50]. Assuming that these four resistant cells lines
have indeed undergone EMT, this would mean that EMT
can be associated (HT-29/5-FU) or not (HCT-116/5-FU,
HCT-116/Oxa, HCT-116/SN-38) with “stemness”, in
agreement with recent models [51, 52].
Finally, two drug-selected cell lines, HT-29/Oxa and
HT-29/SN-38 show a heterogeneous response with respect
to stem cell markers in combination with the presence of a
prominent side population linked to increased expression
of ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC1. Therefore, it appears
that prolonged chemotherapeutic stress was principally
associated with upregulation of ABC drug transporters in
these two cell lines.
Interruption of chronic drug exposure was
accompanied by diminished drug resistance in agreement
with the clinical experience, where drug-free intervals are
typically associated with restoration of drug-sensitivity.
In contrast, the altered expression of stem cell markers
appears more permanent. This observation is coherent
with the dynamic nature of tumor cells that evolves
under chemotherapeutic stress and provides interesting
therapeutic perspectives for second-line treatment. For
example, we recently reported that acquired irinotecan
resistance was associated with upregulation of EGFRand SRC-signaling pathways that can be targeted with
selective anticancer agents [15].
The WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway is altered
in more than 90% of patients with CRC [2] as well as
in patients with breast cancer [53, 54] and hepatocellular
carcinoma [55] making it a particularly attractive
therapeutic target. However, the pathway presents several
features that suggest that it may also be a difficult target.
For example, WNT-signaling appears to play a much
broader role not only in crypt epithelial cells but also in
differentiated epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the small
intestine and colon than was previously anticipated [56].
This is supported by recent findings reporting that
epithelial WNTs are dispensable and that stromal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

production of WNTs can fully support normal murine
intestinal homeostasis [57]. A comprehensive analysis
of human tumor samples from patients with colon or
rectal cancer revealed that multiple lesions affecting the
WNT signaling pathway may co-exist in the same tumor
suggestive of a complex signaling network [2] .Finally,
it was shown that the canonical WNT suppressor Axin 2
promotes colon carcinoma oncogenic activity rather than
functioning as a tumor suppressor as expected [58].
Our results show that WNT-signaling activity
is upregulated in the HT-29/5-FU cells as shown by a
luciferase reporter assay, the expression and localization
of beta-catenin as well as by transcriptional upregulation
of Cyclin D1 and Axin 2, two prominent transcriptional
targets of canonical WNT-signaling. Although WNTsignaling could be attenuated in the HT-29/5-FU cells
by the WNT-signaling inhibitors ICG-001 and PKF 118,
this was not accompanied by any selective growth
inhibitory effects suggesting that the cytotoxic activity of
these compounds is not directly linked to WNT-signaling
inhibition. This unexpected finding was subsequently
confirmed in two chemo-naïve CRC cell lines with strong
WNT-signaling. It is possible that the cytotoxic effects of
WNT inhibition may be context-dependent and rely of the
strength of additional signaling pathways like MAP kinase
signaling [59] or VEGFR1 signaling [60]. However,
although the 24 hours drug exposure used for the reporter
assay and the 120 hours drug exposure used for the MTT
viability assay are not directly comparable, it is noticeable
that the drug concentrations needed for WNT-signaling
inhibition and for the cytotoxic effects are within the same
dose range. This suggests that both inhibitors influence
additional targets (off-targets) within the same dose range
as WNT-signaling inhibition that can induce cell death
independent of the WNT pathway. Future development of
WNT-signaling inhibitors will depend on identification of
these off-targets in order to obtain WNT inhibitors with
increased selectivity.
Taken together, we here show that chronic
chemotherapeutic stress drives the evolution of “stemness”
in a heterogeneous, context-dependent manner in CRC
cells which may provide clues for future therapeutic
strategies for second-line treatment. Furthermore, our
findings reveal that the cytotoxic activities of WNTsignaling inhibitors do not depend on WNT-signaling as
such but rather on off-targets that remain to be identified
for further development of this category of molecules.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
DLD-1 cells were kindly provided by Richard
Hamelin (Paris, France) while SW-480 colon carcinoma
cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD). HT-29 cells were provided
18528

Oncotarget

by Thécla Lesuffleur (Paris, France) and HCT-116 cells
were a kind gift from Bert Vogelstein (Baltimore, MD).
The cells were maintained in, McCoy’s A (HCT116), DMEM (HT-29, SW480) or RPMI (DLD-1)
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (PAA).
HT-29 or HCT-116 cells were exposed to increasing
doses of 5-fluorouracil (Teva-Pharma), oxaliplatin
(Eloxatin, Sanofi-Synthelabo) or SN-38 (the active
metabolite of irinotecan, Abatra-technology) in the culture
media as described in detail elsewhere [9, 10, 15]. The
properties of parental and drug-resistant cells are detailed
in Table 1.

50% reduction of viable cells compared to the untreated
control cells. All values are averages of at least 3 independent
experiments each done in duplicate.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out as described
previously [61, 62] with minor modifications. Cells were
harvested at 70% confluence and cellular lysates were
prepared in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4,
0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM
PMSF, 1 mM Na-F) supplemented with protease inhibitors
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Proteins
were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels (8–12% acrylamide) in
a denaturing buffer followed by transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were incubated with anti-CD44,
anti-CD133, anti-CD166, anti-Lgr5, anti-beta-catenin,
anti-active beta-catenin or anti-actin antibodies followed
by incubation with the appropriate secondary horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Protein expression was
revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL
Amersham).

Reagents and antibodies
PFK118–310 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
while ICG-001 was obtained from Selleck Chemicals.
Alexa fluor 488 phalloidine and 4′, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma.
The antibodies used for Western blot analysis and
immunocytochemistry were: rabbit anti-CD44 (Abcam #
51037), rabbit anti-CD133 (Cell Signaling # 3663),
mouse anti-CD166 (Abcam # 175422), rabbit antiLgr5 (Sigma-Aldrich # HPA012530), goat anti-actin
(Santa Cruz # sc-1615), rabbit anti-beta-catenin (Cell
Signaling  # 8480), mouse antibodies specific for the
active form of beta-catenin, dephosphorylated on Ser 37
and Thr 41 (Millipore, clone 8E7, # 05–665). Anti-rabbit
IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies and antimouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies
were from Cell Signaling whereas Cy3-conjugated antimouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs.
The following antibodies were used for flow
cytometry
analysis:
phycoerythricine-conjugated
mouse anti-human ABCB1 (BD Biosciences # 557003),
phycoerythricine-conjugated
mouse
anti-human
ABCG2 (BD Biosciences # 561180), mouse anti-human
ABCC1 (BD Biosciences # 557594) and anti-mouse
phycoerythricine-conjugated secondary antibodies (BD
Biosciences # 555574).

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from parental and drugresistant HCT-116 and HT-29 cells with MRC Trireagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA quantity and purity was determined by using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 and total RNA from each sample was
reverse transcribed using Revertaid H Minus First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) followed by
amplification of the DNA product with a SYBR Green kit
(Promega). PCR primers were designed with the logiciel
primer3 and gene expression was normalized to GAPDH
as previously described [31].
The threshold was set above the non-template
control background and within the linear phase of target
gene amplification to calculate the number of cycles
at which the transcript was detected. Gene expression
values were calculated based on the comparative delta
CT method [63] and normalized to the housekeeping
gene GAPDH.

Viability assay

Aldehyde dehydrogenase assay

The growth inhibitory effects were determined by
the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) viability test as previously described
[41] with minor modifications. Cells (7,000 cells per well
for HCT-116, 10,000 per well for HT-29, SW480 and
DLD-1) were seeded in 24-well plates in culture media
containing 5% FCS, incubated in drug-free media for
24 hours followed by drug exposure for 120 hours. Cellular
viability was determined by exposing cells to the MTT
tetrazolium salt for 4 hours at 37°C and the formation of
formazan was measured at 590 nm by a microplate reader.
The IC50 value is defined as the drug concentration causing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The ALDFLUOR assay was performed according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (StemCell
Technologies). Briefly, cells were harvested with accutase
(PAA), counted and rinsed with PBS buffer. Cells were resuspended in the ALDFLUOR assay buffer and incubated
with the ALDFLUOR substrate for 45 min at 37°C to
allow substrate conversion. Then, half of the sample
were transferred to tubes containing the specific ALDH
inhibitor, diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). After
centrifugation, cells were suspended in the ALDFLUOR
assay buffer and the ALDH activity analysis was

DAPI, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories)
and observed by microscopy. Fluorescent images were
captured using an inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41)
with a digital compact camera (Olympus camedia C4000)
and a 60x objective.

Colonospheres formation assay
For colonosphere formation, cells (100 cells) were
incubated in serum-free media composed of DMEM
and F12 (1:1) in 96-well ultra-low-attachment plates
(Corning). The media was supplemented with B27 (Life
Technologies), 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/ml
fibroblast growth factor (Sigma), and 100 Units /ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PAA). The
resulting colonospheres were examined using an Olympus
microscope (10x) after 14 days and representative images
collected from at least five microscopic fields.

WNT pathway reporter assay
For the luciferase reporter gene assays, cells were
seeded in 12-well plates at 150,000 cells/well and
incubated in drug-free media for 24 hours. Cells were
then transfected with TOP-Flash (plasmids containing
3 TCF binding sites) and/or their negative counterpart
FOP-Flash (plasmids containing mutant, inactive TCF
binding sites) both from Upstate Technologies using the
Fugene HD reagent (Promega). After 24 hours, cells were
treated, or not, with various concentrations of ICG-001
or PKF118–320. The next day, the luciferase activity was
determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega).
RSV β-galactosidase vector was used for co-transfection
in order to normalize the luciferase activity against
β-galactosidase activity. All assays were performed in
triplicate.

 

 

Side population (SP) assay
The side population was determined as previously
described [64] with minor modifications. Cells were
collected by accutase, pelleted and resuspended in culture
media with 2% FCS, 10 mM Hepes pH7.4 and 100 Units/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin followed by
labelling with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) for
90 min 37°C, in the absence of presence of verapamil
(Sigma-Aldrich). Then, cells were centrifuged and
re- suspended in Hank’s balanced saline solution (Life
Technologies) containing 2% FCS and 10 mM Hepes.
Cells were maintained in darkness at 4°C until flow
cytometry analysis. The SP was determined by analysis
of 106 cells using a FACS LSR II (BD Biosciences)
after counterstaining with propidium iodide to identify
dead cells.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of experimental data was
performed using a Student’s paired t-test, and the results are
presented as mean + SD. Symbols: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001.
