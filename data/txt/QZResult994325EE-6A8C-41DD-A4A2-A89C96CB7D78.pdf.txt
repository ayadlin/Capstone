ABSTRACT
Recently, we have described that siRNA-mediated silencing of runt-related
transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) improves anti-cancer drug gemcitabine (GEM)
sensitivity of p53-deficient human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells through the
augmentation of p53 family TAp63-dependent cell death pathway. In this manuscript,
we have extended our study to p53-mutated human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells.
According to our present results, knockdown of mutant p53 alone had a marginal
effect on GEM-mediated cell death of Panc-1 cells. We then sought to deplete RUNX2
using siRNA in Panc-1 cells and examined its effect on GEM sensitivity. Under our
experimental conditions, RUNX2 knockdown caused a significant enhancement of
GEM sensitivity of Panc-1 cells. Notably, GEM-mediated induction of TAp63 but not
of TAp73 was further stimulated in RUNX2-depleted Panc-1 cells, indicating that,
like AsPC-1 cells, TAp63 might play a pivotal role in the regulation of GEM sensitivity
of Panc-1 cells. Consistent with this notion, forced expression of TAp63α in Panc-1
cells promoted cell cycle arrest and/or cell death, and massively increased luciferase
activities driven by TAp63-target gene promoters such as p21WAF1 and NOXA. In
addition, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RUNX2 forms a complex
with TAp63 in Panc-1 cells. Taken together, our current observations strongly suggest
that depletion of RUNX2 enhances the cytotoxic effect of GEM on p53-mutated Panc1 cells through the stimulation of TAp63-dependent cell death pathway even in the
presence of a large amount of pro-oncogenic mutant p53, and might provide an
attractive strategy to treat pancreatic cancer patients with p53 mutations.

INTRODUCTION

collagen type I alpha 1 and osteopontin [3]. In addition to
its vital role in the regulation of bone formation, a growing
body of evidence strongly suggests that RUNX2 has a prooncogenic potential. For example, RUNX2 has been shown
to be associated with the progression of prostate cancer,
and tightly linked to bone metastasis of breast cancer
cells [4, 5]. Kuo et al. found that RUNX2 induces acute
myeloid leukemia [6]. Kayed et al. described that RUNX2
is aberrantly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and affects
the tumor microenvironment [7]. In accordance with these

Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), which
is one of RUNX family members, has been considered to
be one of the master regulators for bone development and
osteoblast differentiation. Indeed, RUNX2-deficient mice
died just after birth and displayed a complete loss of bone
formation [1, 2]. Consistent with these observations, it has
been shown that RUNX2 transactivates several osteoblast
differentiation-related marker genes such as osteocalcin,

results, Jessica et al. showed that RUNX2 promotes a
tumorigenic phenotype of breast cancer and is predictive
of poor overall survival of breast cancer patients [8].
In contrast to pro-oncogenic RUNX2, a nuclear
transcription factor p53 is a classical tumor supppressor.
Its tumor suppressive role has been shown by two
independent findings. Firstly, the extensive mutation
searches demonstrated that p53 is frequently mutated
in human tumor tissues (around 50%), and over 90%
of its mutations are detected within the genomic region
encoding its sequence-specific DNA-binding domain,
implying that these p53 mutants lack the sequence-specific
tranactivation ability and thereby losing its pro-apoptotic
function. The sequence-specific transactivation ability of
p53 is tightly linked to its cell death-inducing function.
Moreover, p53 mutants exhibit a dominant-negative
behaviour against wild-type p53, and also acquire prooncogenic potential [9, 10]. Secondary, p53-deficient mice
developed spontaneous tumors [11]. Collectively, both of
these observations strongly support the notion that p53 is
a representative tumor suppressor.
Of note, p53 mutation has been detectable in
approximately 75% of human pancreatic cancer [12], which
shows the worst prognosis among human tumors (5-year
survival rate is less than 5%) [13]. For chemotherapy, DNA
damaging agent gemcitabine (GEM) is a current first-line
of the standard treatment given to the most patients with
advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer [14–16],
however, its efficacy is quite limited [17]. Since the
complete surgical resection of pancreatic cancer is difficult
due to its difficulty in early detection [18], chemotherapy,
radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy is a remaining option.
Therefore, it is urgent to clarify the molecular basis behind
GEM-resistant phenotype of pancreatic cancer and also
develop a novel strategy to improve clinical outcomes of
patients with this deadly disease.
Meanwhile, p53 is a member of a small pro-apoptotic
p53 family including p53, p73 and p63. As expected from
their structures, p73/p63 acts as a nuclear transcription
factor to transactivate a overlapping set of p53-target genes
implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest (p21WAF1 and
14-3-3σ), cellular senescence (p21WAF1) and/or cell death
(BAX, NOXA and PUMA) [19, 20]. p73/p63 encodes two
major varients such as TA and ∆N isoforms, arising from
alternative splicing and promoter usage, respectively. TA
isoform contains an NH2-terminal transactivation domain
and has a sequence-specific transactivation ability. In
contrast to TA isoform, transcription-deficient ∆N isoform
lacks an NH2-terminal transactivation domain. Like p53,
TAp73/TAp63 becomes activated in response to DNA
damage, and promotes tumor cell death [21]. It is worth
noting that p53-dependent cell death following DNA
damage requires TAp73 and/or TAp63, whereas TAp73
and/or TAp63 induces DNA damage-mediated cell death
in the absence of p53 [22]. Unlike p53, p73/p63 is rarely
mutated in human tumors [23]. Thus, it is highly likely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that TAp73 and/or TAp63 might promote DNA damagemediated cell death of tumor cells lacking functional p53.
Intriguingly, we have recently found for the first
time that siRNA-mediated silencing of RUNX2 in p53proficient human osteosarcoma U2OS cells augments their
adriamycin (ADR)-sensitivity in a p53/TAp73-dependent
manner [24, 25]. In addition, we have also demonstrated
that GEM sensitivity of p53-null human pancreatic cancer
AsPC-1 cells is further enhanced by RUNX2 knockdown
through the stimulation of TAp63-dependent cell death
pathway [26], which was consistent with the findings that
forced expression of TAp73 promotes cell cycle arrest
and/or cell death in AsPC-1 cells [27]. Based on our recent
results, RUNX2 markedly attenuated the transcriptional as
well as pro-apoptotic activity of p53 in response to DNA
damage through the complex formation with HDAC6 and
p53 [24], and also significantly reduced GEM sensitivity
of p53-deficient pancreatic cancer cells through the
suppression of TAp63 expression [26]. Therefore, our
recent findings indicate that RUNX2 might abrogate the
proper DNA damage response in the above-mentioned
p53-proficient and/or p53-null tumor cells through the
inhibition of p53 family-dependent cell death pathway.
The remaining question is that RUNX2 could contribute
to drug-resistant phenotype of p53-mutated tumor cells.
In this study, we have found that RUNX2 depletionmediated further induction of TAp63 improves the
cytotoxic effect of GEM on p53-mutated Panc-1 cells
(R273H), and thus our present observations strongly
suggest that the disruption of the balance between the
intracellular endogenous amounts of pro-oncogenic
mutant p53 and pro-apoptotic TAp63 might be one of the
attractive strategies for the enhancement of GEM efficacy
of pancreatic cancer patients.

RESULTS
p53-mutated human pancreatic cancer Panc-1
cells display gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant
phenotype
Firstly, we have assessed gemcitabine (GEM)
sensitivity of p53-mutated human pancreatic cancer
Panc-1 cells. To this end, Panc-1 cells were exposed to
the indicated concentrations of GEM. Forty-eight hours
after treatment, pictures of cells were taken (Figure 1A).
Close inspection of them showed that GEM-treated Panc-1
cells are larger in size and number of the attached cells
are reduced in response to GEM. We then collected the
attached and floating cells and performed flow cytometric
analysis. As shown in Figure 1B, percentage of cells
with sub-G1 DNA content (dead cells) was around 10%
at 10 µM of GEM. These results were also supported by
trypan blue exclusion assay, which also demonstrated that
GEM treatment suppresses cell proliferation rate in a dosedependent manner (Figure S1).

Considering that approximately 20% of p53proficient human pancreatic cancer SW1990 cells undergo
cell death under the same experimental conditions [26], it
is suggestive that Panc-1 cells are much more resistant to
GEM relative to SW1990 cells. In accordance with these
observations, Panc-1 cells have been considered to be
one of drug-resistant pancretaic cancer cells [28]. Since
Panc-1 cells express mutant p53, it is likely that GEMresistant phenotype of Panc-1 cells might be attributed at
least in part to the presence of mutant p53. In support of
this notion, it has been well documented that mutant p53
causes an enhanced metastatic potential and anti-cancer
drug-resistance of malignant tumor cells [29, 30].

quantitative RT-PCR experiments under normal condition
(Figure S2).
Since the amounts of γH2AX was remarkably
increased after GEM treatment, GEM introduced DNA
damage into genomic DNA of Panc-1 cells. Meanwhile,
GEM treatment markedly reduced the amounts of p27KIP1
and phospho-histone H3 at Ser-10, which are the reliable
mitosis markers [31, 32], whereas a proteolytic cleavage
of PARP, which is one of cell death markers, was barely
detectable after GEM exposure, indicating that GEM
treatment suppresses cell proliferation rate but not
efficiently promotes cell death.
For p53 family, TAp73/TAp63 was induced in
response to GEM in association with an up-regulation of
their target gene products such as p21WAF1 and NOXA.
Nakaya et al. also revealed that GEM treatment induces
p21WAF1 expression in Panc-1 cells [33]. Consistent with
these observations, E2F-1, a transcriptional activator
for TAp73 [34, 35], was up-regulated following GEM
exposure. Similar results were also obtained from the
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Figure S3). As
mentioned above, p53-mutated Panc-1 cells were much
more resistant to GEM as compared to p53-proficient
SW1990 cells. Based on our present results, it is possible
that a large amount of mutant p53 might prohibit the
sufficient induction of TAp73/TAp63 and/or attenuate

GEM-mediated induction of TAp73/TAp63
together with their target gene products in
Panc-1 cells
To understand the molecular events occurred in
Panc-1 cells following GEM exposure, we have carried
out immunoblotting experiments using whole cell lysates
prepared from Panc-1 cells exposed to the indicated
concentrations of GEM. As seen in Figure 2, mutant p53
was stably overexpressed regardless of GEM treatment,
which was consistent with the results obtained from
indirect immunofluorescence staining and the semi-

expression level of pro-oncogenic RUNX2 protein was
basically constant at mRNA and protein level regardless
of GEM exposure.

Panc-1 cells exposed to GEM (Figure 4A and 4B). Similar
results were also obtained from trypan blue exclusion
assay (Figure S4). Collectively, it is conceivable that
depletion of mutant p53 alone is not sufficient to enhance
the cytotoxic effect of GEM on Panc-1 cells.

Mutant p53 knockdown has a marginal effect on
GEM-mediated cell death of Panc-1 cells

Knockdown of RUNX2 augments
GEM-mediated cell death of Panc-1 cells

To verify the possibility that pro-apoptotic activity
of TAp73/TAp63 could be prohibited by a large amount of
mutant p53 expressed in Panc-1 cells, we sought to deplete
mutant p53 by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Since Panc-1
cells do not carry wild-type p53 allele [36], we have
employed siRNA targeting wild-type p53 to knockdown
mutant p53 in these experiments. As shown in Figure 3,
our siRNA efficiently reduced the expression of mutant
p53 both at mRNA and protein levels. As clearly seen
in Figure 4A, a marked morphological change (large
in size) and an evident decrease in number of viable cells
were observed in mutant p53-knockdown Panc-1 cells
(Figure S4), which might be associated with cell cycle
arrest [37]. Additionally, the amounts of phopho-histone
H3 at Ser-10 was slightly decreased in mutant p53depleted Panc-1 cells, implying that proliferation rate of
Panc-1 cells slows down (Figure 3).
Unexpectedly, depletion of mutant p53 had an
undetectable effect on GEM-induced proteolytic cleavage
of PARP (Figure 3). Consistent with these results, we did
not observe a massive increase in number of floating cells
and cells with sub-G1 DNA content in mutant p53-depleted

Recently, we have found for the first time that
RUNX2 attenuates p53 family-dependent cell death
pathway of p53-proficient and/or p53-deficient tumor
cells in response to DNA damage [25, 26]. These
observations prompted us to ask whether silencing
of RUNX2 could also improve the cytotoxic effect of
GEM on p53-mutated Panc-1 cells in a TAp73/TAp63dependent manner. For this purpose, Panc-1 cells were
transfected with control siRNA or with siRNA against
RUNX2 and then treated with GEM or left untreated. As
seen Figure 5A and 5B, number of the attached cells was
markedly reduced and cells with sub-G1 DNA content
was remarkably increased in RUNX2-depleted cells
exposed to GEM as compared to that of control cells
treated with GEM. Similar results were also obtained
from trypan blue exclusion and DNA fragmentation
assays (Figure S5 and S6), indicating that knockdown of
RUNX2 improves the cytotoxic effect of GEM. While,
indirect immunostaining experiments revealed that
silencing of RUNX2 has a marginal effect on number of
Ki-67-positive cells (Figure S7).

GEM exposure together with or without RUNX2 knockdown.
As shown also in Figure S3, TAp73 and its transcriptional

Next, we have examined the expression patterns
of p53 family-related genes in RUNX2-depleted Panc-1
cells in response to GEM. Under our experimental
conditions, RUNX2 knockdown was successful at mRNA

activator gene E2F-1 were induced in response to GEM,
while RUNX2 knockdown had an undetectable effect on
GEM-mediated induction of TAp73 as well as E2F-1.
Notably, silencing of RUNX2 further augmented GEMmediated stimulation of TAp63 and p53 family-target genes
such as p21WAF1, 14-3-3σ, BAX and NOXA.
To confirm the results obtained from the
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we performed
immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Figure 7, mutant
p53 and p53 family-target gene product BAX remained
constant regardless of GEM exposure with or without
RUNX2 knockdown. Similarly, pro-apoptotic PUMA
remained unchanged in RUNX2-depleted Panc-1 cells
exposed to GEM relative to untreated Panc-1 cells
(data not shown). GEM-mediated up-regulation of
phosphorylation of mutant p53 at Ser-15, acetylation at
Lys-373/382, TAp73 and E2F-1 was detectable, whereas
RUNX2 silencing-dependent further accumulation of them
was not observed. As expected, GEM-mediated induction
of TAp63 and p53 family-target gene products including
cell cycle-related p21WAF1 and pro-apoptotic NOXA was
further augmented in RUNX2-depleted Panc-1 cells.

Thus, these observations suggest that depletion of RUNX2
enhances the cytotoxic effect of GEM on Panc-1 cells
through the up-regulation of TAp63-dependent cell death
pathway.

Forced expression of TAp63 promotes cell cycle
arrest and/or cell death of Panc-1 cells
To ask whether forced expression of TAp63 alone
could enhance p53 family-target promoter activities in
Panc-1 cells, we carried out luciferase reporter assay. To
this end, Panc-1 cells were transfected with the luciferase
reporter plasmid carrying human p53 family-responsible
p21WAF1 or NOXA promoter and Renilla luciferase plasmid
together with or without the increasing amounts of
TAp63α (the longest TAp63 isoform) [20] expression
plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell
lysates were prepared and their luciferase activities were
measured. As clearly seen in Figure 8A, luciferase activity
driven by p21WAF1 or NOXA promoter was markedly
elevated in TAp63α-overexpressing Panc-1 cells in a
dose-dependent manner, indicating that forced expression

significantly attenuated in p63-depleted cells as compared
to non-depleted cells (Figure 9B).
Together, our present observations strongly suggest
that depletion of RUNX2 improves the cytotoxic effect of
GEM on p53-mutated Panc-1 cells through the stimulation
of TAp63-dependent cell death pathway.

of TAp63 transactivates its target gene promoters even in
the presence of mutant p53.
We then asked whether forced expression of TAp63
could also promote cell cycle arrest and/or cell death
in Panc-1 cells. For this purpose, Panc-1 cells were
transfected with the empty plasmid (pcDNA3) or with the
expression plasmid for TAp63α. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were transferred into fresh medium
containing G418. Two weeks after selection, G418resistant colonies were fixed and stained with Giemsa’s
solution. As shown in Figure 8B, forced expression of
TAp63α was successful. As expected, number of G418resistant colonies was significantly reduced in TAp63αoverexpressing cells as compared to that in pcDNA3transfected cells (Figure 8C), indicating that TAp63
induces cell cycle arrest and/or cell death in Panc-1 cells.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have found for the first time
that siRNA-mediated silencing of RUNX2 enhances the
cytotoxic effect of GEM on p53-mutated pancreatic cancer
Panc-1 cells through the augmentation of TAp63-dependent
cell death pathway. Indeed, exogenous expression of
TAp63α in Panc-1 cells increased the luciferase activities
driven by p53 family-target promoters and also promoted
cell cycle arrest and/or cell death as examined by luciferase
reporter analysis and colony formation assay, respectively.
As described [28], Panc-1 cells are the typical drugresistant pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, it is highly likely
that intracellular balance of the endogenous expression
levels between pro-apoptotic TAp63 and pro-oncogenic
mutant p53 might be a vital determinant of pancreatic
cancer cell fate in response to GEM.
It has been well established that RUNX2 acts
as one of the master transcriptional regulators of bone
development through the sequence-specific transactivation
of osteocalcin, collagen type I alpha 1 and osteopontin
[3]. Accumulating evidence, however, strongly suggests
that RUNX2 also has a pro-oncogenic potential [4–8].

Silencing of p63 suppresses GEM-dependent
DNA fragmentation
To verify whether RUNX2/TAp63 regulatroy axis
could play a vital role in GEM-induced cell death of Panc-1
cells, we have conducted siRNA-mediated knockdown of
p63. Panc-1 cells were transfected with control siRNA or
with siRNA targeting p63 and then treated with or without
GEM. As seen in Figure 9A, knockdown of TAp63 was
successful. Under the same experimental conditions,
genomic DNA was prepared from the indicated cells
and analyzed by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. As
expected, GEM-dependent DNA fragmentation was

knockdown of RUNX2 in Panc-1 cells further stimulated
GEM-mediated induction of cell cycle-related p21WAF1 and
pro-apoptotic NOXA, which was tightly associated with
up-regulation of TAp63. These results prompted us to ask
whether both of p53 family-target gene products (p21WAF1
and NOXA) could be required for GEM-mediated cell
death. Our additional experiments revealed that silencing
of NOXA causes a poor response to GEM in Panc-1 cells,
whereas GEM-dependent cell death is obviously enhanced
in p21WAF1-depleted Panc-1 cells (Figure S8). These
observations suggest that TAp63-mediated induction of
NOXA but not of p21WAF1 is essential for GEM-dependent
cell death of Panc-1 cells.
As mentioned above, silencing of RUNX2 in
Panc-1 cells caused a significant induction of TAp63 at
mRNA and protein level. Consistent with our present
observations, we have recently demonstrated that TAp63
is up-regulated in RUNX2-depleted pancreatic cancer
AsPC-1 cells, and also found the putative RUNX2-binding
consensus sites within the 5′-upstream region of TAp63
gene (26). Although further studies should be required to
adequately address this issue, it is possible that RUNX2mediated down-regulation of TAp63 might be one of the
molecular mechanisms behind GEM-resistant phenotype
of Panc-1 cells. As seen in Figure 8, forced expression of
TAp63α in Panc-1 cells stimulated the luciferase activity
driven by p53 family-target promoters such as p21WAF1 and
NOXA and also induced cell cycle arrest and/or cell death
even in the presence of mutant p53. These observations
imply that a large amount of TAp63 overcomes the
negative effect of mutant p53 as well as RUNX2 against
TAp63. Intriguingly, our immunoprecipitation experiments

In accordance with this notion, several lines of
evidence demonstrated that, in addition to osteoblast
differentiation-related genes, RUNX2 transactivates
invasion and metastasis-related genes such as MMPs
(metalloproteinases) and VEGF (vascular endothelial
growth factor) [38–40]. Indeed, Tandon et al. described
that RUNX2 promotes metastatic spread of mammary
tumor cells and depletion of RUNX2 abrogates the latestage tumor cell growth [41]. Of note, Lim et al. found that
RUNX2 transactivates pro-oncogenic survivin and thus
contributes to the growth of prostate tumor [42]. Recently,
Trotter et al. demonstrated that RUNX2 is tightly involved
in the promotion of multiple myeloma growth, survival
and progression through the up-regulation of Akt/betacatenin/survivin pro-oncogenic signaling pathway [43].
Under our experimental conditions, we have observed
that survivin expression is siginificantly elevated in
Panc-1 cells exposed to GEM, indicating that survivin
contributes at least in part to GEM-resistant phenotype of
Panc-1 cells (data not shown). As described [44], survivin
expression was negatively regulated by wild-type p53.
Since Panc-1 cells lack wild-type p53, it is possible that
survivin might be escaped from wild-type p53-mediated
transcriptional repression machinery. Intriguingly, GEMmediated stimulation of survivin was attenuated in
RUNX2-depleted Panc-1 cells (data not shown). In view of
the observed expression pattern of survivin during GEM
exposure, further studies should be required to clarify the
molecular mechanisms of the possible involvement of
RUNX2/survivin pro-oncogenic pathway in the genesis
and/or maintenance of GEM-resistant phenotype of
pancreatic cancer cells. Based on our present observations,

revealed that RUNX2 forms a complex with TAp63
in Panc-1 cells (Figure S9). In addition to the possible
RUNX2-mediated transcriptional repression of TAp63, it
is conceivable that RUNX2 prohibits the transcriptional
as well as pro-apoptotic function of TAp63 through the
complex formation with TAp63.
Since silencing of RUNX2 improved the cytotoxic
effect of GEM on Panc-1 cells, it is of potential interest
to investigate the proteolytic degradation system of
RUNX2. It is possible that GEM-resistant phenotype of
Panc-1 cells might be at least in part due to the basically
constant expression level of RUNX2 in response to GEM.
Jonason et al. described that RUNX2 is tightly regulated
at transcription level and also through post-translational
mechanisms involving the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
[45]. In this connection, it has been shown that E3
ubiquitin ligases such as Smurf1, WWP1 and CHIP
promote ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of
RUNX2 [46–48]. In addition to them, Kumar et al. found
that there is an inverse relationship between the expression
patterns of RUNX2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbw7α, and
Fbw7α promotes ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal
degradation of RUNX2 [49]. Notably, several lines of
evidence showed that Fbw7 acts as a tumor suppressor
by targeting numerous pro-oncogenic proteins for
ubiquitination and degradation such as c-Myc, c-Jun,
Mcl-1 and cyclin E [50, 51]. Moreover, Ji et al. described
that loss of function of Fbw7 is closely implicated in the
development of pancreatic cancer [52]. Therefore, it is of
great interest to further investigate whether there could
exist a functional link among TAp63, RUNX2 and Fbw7
in response to GEM.
Another finding of our present study is that,
unexpectedly, knockdown of mutant p53 alone is not
sufficient to further enhance GEM-mediated cell death
of Panc-1 cells. From our present results, depletion of
mutant p53 markedly suppressed cell proliferation rate
as examined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Similarly,
Zhu et al. found that siRNA-mediated silencing of mutant
p53 in human bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells leads
to a massive growth inhibition [28]. In addition, cisplatin
(CDDP) sensitivity was evidently enhanced in mutant p53depleted bladder cancer cells [26]. It might be attributed
to CDDP-mediated activation of wild-type p53 encoded
by the remaining allele of these bladder cancer cells,
however, Panc-1 cells lack wild-type p53 allele [35]. Ge
et al. revealed that re-activation of wild-type p53 in p53mutated prostate cancer DU145 cells induces cell cycle
arrest [53, 54].
Zhu et al. also demonstrated that, in addition to the
suppression of cell proliferation rate caused by silencing
of mutant p53, cell death as well as G2-phase cell cycle
arrest simultaneously takes place in mutant p53-depleted
bladder cancer cells [28]. When compared to control
siRNA-transfected Panc-1 cells, mutant p53-depleted
Panc-1 cells were larger in size and exhibited a lower
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferation rate accompanied by a slight decrease in the
amounts of phospho-histone H3 at Ser-10. Since phosphohistone H3 at Ser-10 is one of the established molecular
markers of mitosis, mitotic arrested cells and/or cells
with prolonged mitosis accumulate phospho-histone H3
at Ser-10 [31]. Considering that the lower proliferation
rate and the slight decrease in the amounts of phosphohistone H3 at Ser-10 in mutant p53-knockdown Panc-1
cells, it is suggestive that knockdown of mutant p53 alone
might induce cell cycle arrest before the initiation and/or
after the termination of mitosis. Alternatively, it has been
shown that phospho-histone H3 at Ser-10 is essential for
neoplastic cell transformation and tumor development
independent on cell cycle profile [55, 56]. Further studies
should be required to adequately address the possible role
of phospho-histone H3 at Ser-10 in the sensitivity to GEM.
In conclusion, our current findings strongly suggest
that depletion of RUNX2 improves GEM sensitivity of
p53-mutated pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells in a TAp63dependent manner, and thus our present study might
provide a novel strategy to enhance the cytotoxic efficacy
of GEM on aggressive and metastatic pancreatic cancer
patients with p53 mutation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; WAKO, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL
streptmycin in incubators with humidified atmospheres of
5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C.

WST assay
Cells were transferred into 96-well plates at a
density of 1 × 103/well and incubated overnight. After
the incubation, cells were exposed to the indicated
concentrations of gemcitabine (GEM) (WAKO, Osaka,
Japan). Forty-eight hours after treatment, the relative
number of viable cells was assessed using Cell Counting
Kit-8 reagent (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Trypan blue exclusion assay
The effect of GEM on cell proliferation was analyzed
by the standard trypan blue exclusion assay. In brief, cells
were seeded at a density of 5 × 105/6-well plates and
cultured overnight. After the incubation, cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of GEM. Forty-eight
hours after treatment, the attached and floating cells were

gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

FACS analysis
For flow cytometric analysis, cells were exposed
to the indicated concentrations of GEM. Forty-eight
hours after treatment, the attached and floating cells were
harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20°C overnight.
After fixation, cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL of
RNase A at 37°C for 30 min, and stained with 50 mg/
mL of propidium iodide (PI). There DNA contents were
analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer equipped with
Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Immunoblotting
Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer containing
25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a commercial
protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Whole cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were analyzed by
immunoblotting as described [24] using the following
antibodies: anti-p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-phospho-p53 at Ser-15
(Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA, USA), antiacetyl-p53 at Lys-373/382 (Millipore, Billerica, MA,

San Diego, CA, USA) or anti-actin antibody (20–33;
Sigma). The immuno-reactive proteins were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Colony formation assay
Cells were tranfected with the expression plasmid
for TAp63α or with the empty plasmid pcDNA3
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using Lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s suggestions. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were transferred to the fresh medium
containing G418 (at a final concentration of 800 mg/mL).
Two weeks after the selection, G418-resistant colonies
were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa’s
solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from GEM-treated or
untreated cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed by
SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
resultant cDNA was used for PCR-based amplification.
