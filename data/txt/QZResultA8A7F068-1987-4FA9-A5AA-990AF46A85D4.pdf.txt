Abstract
Many cancers adapt to chemotherapeutic agents by upregulating membrane efﬂux pumps that export
drugs from the cytoplasm, but this response comes at an energetic cost. In breast cancer patients, expression
of these pumps is low in tumors before therapy but increases after treatment. While the evolution of
therapeutic resistance is virtually inevitable, proliferation of resistant clones is not, suggesting strategies of
adaptive therapy. Chemoresistant cells must consume excess resources to maintain resistance mechanisms,
so adaptive therapy strategies explicitly aim to maintain a stable population of therapy-sensitive cells to
suppress growth of resistant phenotypes through intratumoral competition. We used computational models
parameterized by in vitro experiments to illustrate the efﬁcacy of such approaches. Here, we show that low
doses of verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose, to accentuate the cost of resistance and to decrease energy
production, respectively, could suppress the proliferation of drug-resistant clones in vivo. Compared with
standard high-dose-density treatment, the novel treatment we developed achieved a 2-fold to 10-fold increase
in time to progression in tumor models. Our ﬁndings challenge the existing ﬂawed paradigm of maximum
dose treatment, a strategy that inevitably produces drug resistance that can be avoided by the adaptive
therapy strategies we describe. Cancer Res; 72(24); 6362–70. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Disseminated breast cancer remains almost uniformly fatal
largely because of evolution of resistance to available systemic
therapies. While some breast cancer patients do not receive
any beneﬁt from systemic therapy, most have a good initial
response but later develop resistance and the tumor recurs.
Typically, response to subsequent therapies is less and less
durable until ﬁnally no therapy is effective. While de novo
resistance may be environment mediated (because of ischemia, hypoxia, or tumor–stroma interactions through adhesion
or soluble factors), relapse with tumor progression is generally
because of the selection for speciﬁc phenotypes that confer
chemoresistance (1).
A common and well-studied mechanism of acquired resistance is increased expression of p-glycoprotein (PGP) membrane pumps, which export a number of different chemother-

apeutics from the cytoplasm. Patients treated with doxorubicin and vincristine, both PGP substrates, have shown a direct
correlation of PGP detection with previous treatment (2, 3). In
vitro selection of drug-resistant cell lines to the novel agent
Carﬁlzomib, a proteasome inhibitor, also promoted PGP overexpression, among other mechanisms (4).
PGP is a versatile membrane pump, and its substrates
include multiple chemotherapeutic and targeted agents. Thus,
acquisition of resistance to one drug through PGP overexpression frequently confers cross-resistance to multiple other
drugs—hence the term multidrug resistance (MDR). Importantly, PGP substrates include a number of nonchemotherapy
drugs including verapamil, cyclosporin A, and sestamibi (5).
This property has been previously proposed to overcome MDR
by adding competing molecules for PGP sites and, thus,
decrease the chemotherapy efﬂux. In vitro work with PGP
overexpressing cell lines (6), has shown that verapamil, at
subcytotoxic levels, was capable of reverting the MDR phenotype (7, 8).
Several clinical trials have examined simultaneous administration of chemotherapy and PGP substrates (9)—the latter
acting as a competing ligand to increase the intracellular
concentration of the former. However, results have been
disappointing, in part because of dose limitation of PGP
modulators (10, 11), which typically require micromolar concentrations, which are not clinically attainable.
Recently, our group has suggested that the proliferation of
chemoresistant clones could be delayed, if the minimum drug
intensity necessary to maintain a stable tumor burden were
used, instead of the standard maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Prolonging Progression-Free Survival in Breast Cancer

This approach was termed adaptive therapy (AT; ref. 12). The
basic hypothesis of AT is that, while evolution of resistant
strategies is inevitable, proliferation of resistant populations is
not. AT seeks to suppress proliferation of resistant cells by
exploiting the cost linked to the drug-resistance mechanism.
That is, chemoresistant cells must synthesize and activate
proteins that protect them from chemotherapy. This requires
diversion of resources that would otherwise be available for
proliferation. Thus, in the absence of chemotherapy, we propose that the chemoresistant cells are signiﬁcantly less ﬁt than
chemosensitive cells. To exploit this difference, AT applies
chemotherapy judiciously to explicitly maintain a small residual population of chemosensitive cells. These cells, during
chemotherapy intervals, will proliferate at the expense of the
chemoresistant cells. In effect, AT seeks to maintain a population of cells that can be controlled using them to suppress
proliferation of cells that cannot be controlled by therapy.
Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which ﬁxes drug dose and
schedule, AT aims to ﬁx the size of the tumor, and continuously
adjusts the chemotherapy to achieve that goal (12). Using
animal models and computational simulations, our group
determined that 2 factors were decisive for the success of AT:
the initial prevalence of chemoresistant cells, and the difference in the growth rate of the 2 subpopulations during chemotherapy intervals.
While the initial ratios of chemoresistant and chemosensitive cells are inherent to each patient, we hypothesized that the
energetic cost of PGP pumps could be manipulated as a means
of further reducing the ﬁtness of chemoresistant cells during
chemotherapy intervals. This would effectively increase the
ﬁtness advantage of the drug sensitive cells and allow them to
further out-compete the chemoresistant clones, and further
delay tumor progression.
This hypothesis is supported by prior studies showing that
PGPþ mutants have accelerated glucose metabolism (13), and
faster ATP depletion in glucose-free medium (14). Furthermore, increased glucose usage has been observed in PGPoverexpressing cells when exposed to verapamil or other PGP
substrates (15). Taken together, these observations indicate
that PGPþ cells grow in vitro at approximately the same rate as
their PGP counterparts, only because of the abundance of
nutrients and oxygen. In hypoxia and low glucose, however, the
basal activity of the PGP pumps taxes their growth, an effect
exacerbated by the use of PGP substrates at subtoxic levels.
In this work, we combined in vitro and computational
models to investigate the possibility of maintaining a stable
tumor burden by enhancing the energetic cost of therapy
resistance.

Growth rates
The growth rates were determined using 2 methods: ﬁrst, we
measured the biomass increase by crystal violet staining (17).
Second, we quantiﬁed the number of adherent live cells in real
time (Fig. 1) in the xCelligence system (Roche) during 96 hours,
for both cell lines, in normal culture conditions and in reduced
glucose (2 and 0.5 g/L glucose, respectively).
To assess the ﬁtness cost of PGP-mediated chemoresistance,
we mixed and plated MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cells at a 2:1 ratio.
Cells were initially cultured in normal media for 24 hours, when
media was changed, and cells were allowed to grow for
additional 72 hours in either normal or low glucose, with or
without verapamil (1 mmol/L), with or without doxorubicin
(Fig. 2). The dead cells were washed away and wells were

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
In this study, we used the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and
the PGP overexpressing chemoresistant MCF-7/Dox. The dose
responses of these 2 cell lines were assessed for doxorubicin,
and the IC50 values were determined to be 10.7 and 476.5
ng/mL, respectively. Both cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection or Michigan Cancer Foundation
(16). MCF-7/Dox cells were maintained in the presence of

in normal culture media (2 g/L of glucose) and grown for 24 hours when
media was changed to normal glucose concentration (2 g/L), low glucose
concentration (0.5 g/L), or no glucose. The PGP cells maintained their
growth in the 3 conditions, indicating that their energetic needs can be
supplied from other sources in the media. The PGPþ mutant, however,
showed loss of viability after 96 hours in glucose-free medium and
120 hours in low-glucose serum.

Figure 2. Competition of MCF-7 wild-type and PGP mutant cells in coculture shows reversal of ﬁtness by energy restriction and verapamil. MCF-7 (wild-type)
and the PGP mutant (MCF-7/Dox) were plated in a 2:1 ratio for 72 hours when nuclei were counted, and wild-type and PGP mutants were differentiated by
calceinAM exclusion. In high-glucose medium the PGP mutant showed a shorter doubling time than the wild-type (22.4 hours vs. 24 hours), and the
addition of verapamil did not alter these values. In restricted glucose conditions, however, both populations replicated more slowly (28 and 26.3 hours for the
wild-type and PGP mutant, respectively). The addition of verapamil in low-glucose conditions did not affect the growth of the wild-type cells, but approximately
doubled the doubling time of the PGP mutant (51 hours), indicating that the combination of energy restriction and a high-afﬁnity PGP substrates tips the ﬁtness
advantage toward the wild-type population. The bottom right charts depict the changes in doubling time of MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox as a function of
2-deoxyglucose and verapamil. The wild-type population (left) doubles at approximately every 24 hours in optimum conditions, but its growth is delayed upon
reduction of 50% of glucose availability. The PGP mutant (right) has a faster doubling time than the wild-type and maintains its growth rate even at high rates of
verapamil. However, energy restriction combined with the PGP substrate signiﬁcantly delays replication. The equations that describe both curves are
explained in the Supplemental Fig. S1. WT, wild-type; CNTRL, control; VERAP, verapamil; DOX, doxorubicin; 2DG, 2-deoxyglucose.

incubated with calceinAM (1 mmol/L), a ﬂuorescent PGP
substrate, and Hoechst 33342 (1 mg/mL): the drug sensitive
cells accumulate both dyes, whereas the PGP-positive cells
efﬂux calceinAM. We captured ﬂuorescent images by Axiovision (Zeiss) and quantiﬁed population sizes using CellProﬁler
(Broad Institute).
Metabolism
Previous works (14, 15, 18) suggested that PGP mutants had
increased glycolytic metabolism and sensitivity to energy
restriction. We studied how the MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cell
lines differed in terms of glucose consumption, and their main
energetic pathway: either anaerobic or aerobic glycolysis.
The glucose uptake rate was estimated by the accumulation
of the ﬂuorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG, which is transported by facilitated transport into the cytoplasm and loses
ﬂuorescence upon phosphorylation by hexokinase (Fig. 3;
ref. 19). The ﬂuorescence in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cells
was measured for 60 minutes, and the ratio between the
derivatives of the curves at time 0 minutes was used to
determine the fold increase in the glucose transport potential
of both cell lines.

We studied the glycolytic metabolism of both cell lines using
the XF Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience), which measures pH
and pO2 changes in live cell culture in real time. For this
assay we measured the acid production and oxygen consumption rates of both cell lines in: (i) glucose-free medium,
(ii) upon addition of glucose (5 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration),
(iii) upon addition of oligomycin, which impairs mitochondrial respiration, and (iv) 2-deoxyglucose (Fig. 3), a competitor for glucose transporters, hexokinase, and blocks glycolysis because of accumulation at the phosphoglucoisomerase
level (20).
Computational model of clinical treatment
The clinical treatment computational model used in this
article is an extension of our previous work on AT (12): the
tumor burden of a patient was composed by 2 subpopulations
of cancer cells, one chemosensitive and the other chemoresistant (Supplementary Fig. S1). We extended this model to
include the growth rates and drug sensitivity, in optimum and
energy-restricted conditions, obtained from the in vitro experiments with MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cell lines. The doubling

Prolonging Progression-Free Survival in Breast Cancer

Figure 3. Differential glucose metabolism in MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox. Top left, 2-NBDG is a ﬂuorescent glucose analog, which once internalized and
phosphorylated, loses its ﬂuorescence. The graph depicts, in arbitrary ﬂuorescence units, the accumulation of nonphosphorylated 2-NBDG in the
ﬁrst hour of incubation. Using Michaelis–Menten dynamics, Vmax of glucose uptake for the PGP mutant is 4 times higher than for the wild-type (165 RFU/min vs.
40 RFU/min). Bottom right, in glucose-free medium (No Glu), MCF-7 cells and PGPþ mutants (MCF-7/Dox) produce most of their energy through
aerobic metabolism. Once glucose is added to the medium (Glu), MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cells increase their energy production through glycolysis by
approximately 30% and 50%, respectively. The addition of oligomycin (Oli) greatly decreases aerobic metabolism in mitochondria, forcing cells
to extract energy from anaerobic glycolysis exclusively, exposing the maximum glycolytic potential of these cells, which is roughly 3 times higher in the
PGPþ mutant than in the parental cell line. The addition of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) greatly reduces energy production in
both cell lines.

as the effect of 2-deoxyglucose and verapamil, measured in
vitro are depicted in Fig. 2. The parameters for this model,
including the effects of verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose in the
doubling time and sensitivity to doxorubicin, are listed in the
Supplementary Table S1.
Each computational simulation compared four different
scenarios: (i) MTD, which halved the drug-sensitive population
at every bolus, arbitrarily spaced by 5 days; (ii) MTD combined
with chronic verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose, at concentrations
of 100 nmol/L and 5 mmol/L, respectively (MTD þ V þ 2DG);
(iii) AT, which consisted of an initial dose of half of the MTD,
and adjusting the dose intensity by increases or decreases of
20%, in case of tumor growth or reduction, respectively; and (iv)
AT combined with chronic verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose (AT
þ V þ 2DG).
The detection level for tumor burden was arbitrarily established as 109 cells and the lethal burden as 3 orders of
magnitude higher, 1012 cells (21). Considering that a subpopulation of drug-resistant clones is already present in all simulations, the best treatment would be the one that extended the
hypothetical patient survival the longest (Figs. 4 and 5), or
indeﬁnitely.
Verapamil levels in these simulations (100 nmol/L) were
chosen because of dose-limiting heart damage, previously
observed in clinical trials (10).

Results
PGP mutants have accelerated glycolytic metabolism
The MCF-7/Dox cells replicate faster than MCF-7 in optimum conditions: 22.4 hours versus 24 hours. However, the
energetic cost of resistance of the basal activity of the PGP
pumps becomes a signiﬁcant burden for these cells under
energy restricted conditions: while MCF-7 cells are able to
maintain their growth rate in absence of glucose for more than
120 hours, the MCF-7/Dox lose viability after 72 hours in
absence of glucose (Fig. 1).
Energy restriction and PGP substrates synergistically
reverse ﬁtness of PGP mutants
We investigated if the addition of a glycolytic antimetabolite,
and low doses of nonchemotherapeutic PGP substrates, could
be used in combination with AT to further reduce the ﬁtness of
chemoresistant cells during therapy intervals.
When cocultured in optimum glucose conditions, the PGPþ
mutant overgrows the parental cell line, but in low glucose
concentrations, and in combination with verapamil, the parental cell line out-competes the drug resistant cells (Fig. 2).
Figure 2 (right) depicts how glucose restriction, or addition
of 2-deoxyglucose, increases the doubling time of MCF-7 cells
from 24 to 28 hours, whereas verapamil has no effect (note in
the column "Low Glucose" the reduction in the number of

Figure 4. Tumor burden simulation of a hypothetical patient carrying a subpopulation of 10% PGP mutants treated with standard or AT regimens combined
with verapamil and 2DG. MTD (upper left) promptly reduces the total tumor burden, but the patient soon relapses and stops responding. The combination of
MTD with an antimetabolite (2DG) and a PGP substrate (verapamil) increases patient survival in approximately 30% (upper right). AT (bottom left) is
capable of maintaining the resistant subpopulation under control for longer (increase in overall survival by 50%). The best results are obtained when 2DG and
verapamil are administered together with AT, resulting in a 4-fold increase in progression-free survival. Progression-free survival was considered as the
interval between the beginning of the treatment and the moment when the tumor burden resumes growth in presence of therapy. In this example, progressionfree survival was 35 days for MTD and 135 days for AT þ verapamil þ 2DG. The simulations considered 2 subpopulations of cancer cells: the ﬁrst corresponded
to 90% of the tumor burden and had growth rate and drug response modeled from in vitro experiments with MCF-7 cells. The second subpopulation
represented 10% of the total tumor burden and had the same growth and drug response properties as the PGP mutant MCF-7/Dox. The description
of the computational model and parameter values (doubling time and drug sensitivity) are described in the Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary
Table S1. The IC50 for the chemosensitive subpopulation was arbitrarily set to 1, whereas for the PGPþ mutant, it was considered to be 100-fold higher. The
standard therapeutic dose was also set as one arbitrary unit, and the initial dose of the AT algorithm was set as half this value.

MCF-7 cells, in gray, when compared with "High Glucose," but
no additional difference is observed in the ﬁnal number of
MCF-7 when Verapamil is added to the low-glucose media).
Similarly, MCF-7/Dox responded to glucose restriction with an
increase in the doubling time from 22.4 to 26.3 hours, whereas
the verapamil alone in high-glucose media had no effect. The
combination of verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose, however,
caused a 2-fold increase in doubling time for the PGP mutant
(22.4–51 hours). When the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is added to the high-glucose media, the PGP mutant
became ﬁtter (more surviving cells than the wild-type). This
dominance was reversed by addition of verapamil or by energy
restriction alone.
PGP mutants show upregulation of glucose uptake
We studied the rate of glucose uptake in both cell lines
through accumulation of the ﬂuorescent glucose analog 2NBDG (Fig. 3). The initial rate of uptake of the glucose analog in
the PGPþ mutant (estimated as the ﬁrst derivative at time 00 )
was 4 times higher than for the parental cell line (165 RFU/min

6366

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

vs. 40 RFU/min), indicating that part of the accelerated glucose
metabolism observed in the MCF-7/Dox cells is because of an
increase in the glucose transporter activity.
PGP mutants are more dependent on anaerobic
glycolysis
To estimate the actual ATP production, we made the
following assumptions: (i) all oxygen consumed is used in the
Krebs cycle, and every 6 molecules of O2 consumed produces 36
molecules of ATP; (ii) the proton production corresponds to
approximately 85% of the lactate production in atmospheric
conditions (pO2  21%; ref. 22); and (iii) that every molecule of
lactate produced corresponds to the generation of 1 ATP
molecule through anaerobic glycolysis.
Using these assumptions, we generated the chart of Fig. 3,
which suggests three main conclusions: (i) glucose restriction
does not signiﬁcantly affect energy production in MCF-7 cells,
but causes a 20% decrease in the MCF-7/Dox, (ii) the extra
energy produced by the PGPþ mutants comes from anaerobic
glycolysis, and (iii) when aerobic metabolism is blocked, the

Prolonging Progression-Free Survival in Breast Cancer

Figure 5. Tumor burden simulation
of a hypothetical patient carrying a
subpopulation of 5% PGP mutants
treated with standard or AT regimens
combined with verapamil and 2DG.
In a hypothetical untreated patient
with an average PGPþ
subpopulation (5%), the
combination of AT, 2DG, and
verapamil (bottom right) is capable of
keeping the patient stable for over
500 days in contrast to the observed
survival of 122 days of MTD (top left).
Similarly to Fig. 4, these simulations
consisted in a mix of chemosensitive
and PGP-positive chemoresistant
cells, but this time at a proportion of
95% and 5% of the total tumor
burden, respectively. These 2
subpopulations were modeled
based on in vitro data from the
MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cell lines.
The competition between these
subclones was modeled as
described in Supplementary Fig. S1,
with growth rate and dose response
parameters listed Supplementary
Table S1.

PGPþ mutants are capable of obtaining from 2- to 3-fold more
energy anaerobically than the parental cell line.
Computational models
The principle of AT is that the competition between chemosensitive and chemoresistant tumor cells would reduce the
growth rate of both populations. Conventional high-dose
therapy sharply decreases the sensitive tumor subpopulation,
which allows the regrowth of drug-resistant clones. To avoid
this negative effect, AT proposes to treat patients with the
minimum drug concentration required to maintain tumor
burden below a disease-inducing level.
Our simulations using AT showed that the drug-resistant
population could be maintained stable, if at least 1 of 2
conditions were satisﬁed: (i) the drug resistant cells were
present in a very small number or (ii) the drug-resistant cells
were less ﬁt in absence of therapy (slower replication). As
shown for the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the cost of
chemoresistance can be masked in optimum growth conditions, as is the case in vitro. However, in the inhospitable tumor
microenvironment, there is a clear ﬁtness disadvantage for the
PGPþ cells, which can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by combining
PGP substrates and glycolytic antimetabolites.
We simulated the combination of AT with chronic administration of low concentrations of verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose during chemotherapy intervals. The simulated patients
had an initial prevalence of PGPþ of 10% or less (Figs. 4 and 5),
based on Wishart and colleagues (23), who examined a cohort
of 29 untreated breast cancer patients, and found that PGP
expression was observed in less than 10% of cells in 28 of 29
patients. Similar results were obtained in examining the PGP

www.aacrjournals.org

expression in multiple myeloma specimens from untreated
patients, with reported median cell expression of 3% to 7% (24).
Our simulations showed that, compared with traditional
high-dose-density therapy, patients with initial prevalence of
10% PGPþ cells (Fig. 4) have a 2- to 3-fold increase in
progression-free survival using AT, and a 4-fold increase when
AT was enhanced using verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose.
In patients with a smaller chemoresistant subpopulation,
progression-free survival (compared with MTD) is improved by
a factor of 4 with AT, and by a factor of 10 with the AT þ
verapamil þ 2-deoxyglucose combination (Fig. 5).

Discussion
We previously proposed that the growth of subpopulations of resistant clones in a heterogeneous tumor could be
suppressed, if a competing chemosensitive population were
spared. This approach, termed AT, explicitly limits application of chemotherapy to maintain a stable population of
chemosensitive cells that, through their ﬁtness advantage in
the absence of therapy, suppress proliferation of resistant
phenotypes.
Although this initially appears to be a radical departure from
conventional high-dose-density therapy, the concept of AT,
which uses a lower dose and more tolerable chemotherapy, is
in agreement with the clinical goals for the treatment of
metastatic breast cancer. That is, chronic long-term treatment
with intermittent breaks and/or frequent dose reductions
occurs regularly because of toxicity. In addition, quality of life
is an important aspect of therapy because the treatment is
ongoing and not curable. Therefore, treatment at the MTD,
especially in the long term, is difﬁcult to maintain. Thus, the AT

strategy seeks to use conventional practice but use evolutionary principles to obtain optimal long-term tumor control.
Traditional attempts to circumvent cancer cell resistance to
chemotherapy have focused on using PGP substrates to compete for membrane efﬂux pumps, and increase intracellular
accumulation of chemotherapy. In vitro studies have shown
that verapamil and quinidine cause intracellular chemotherapy accumulation only when present in high concentrations
[10 mmol/L for both (7, 25)]. Unfortunately, conventional
clinical doses of these PGP substrates cannot achieve this
concentration [the maximum concentrations observed in clinical trials were 5.5 mmol/L for quinidine (11), and 0.5 mmol/L for
verapamil (10)]. Thus, it is not surprising that clinical results
for combining chemotherapy and verapamil were disappointing. Furthermore, PGP is only one of several intra- and extracellular drug-resistance mechanisms (26).
Here, we propose an extension of this strategy that exploits
the many available PGP substrates. We hypothesize that nonchemotherapeutic PGP-substrate drugs might be used to
increase the metabolic cost of MDR, reducing the ﬁtness of
the overexpressing PGP cells during chemotherapy intervals.
As PGP overexpressing cells consume ATP to extrude drugs,
we propose that the chronic administration of nonchemotherapeutic PGP substrates will exhaust resources in the chemoresistant population, reducing their ability to proliferate. Thus,
our goal, rather than inhibiting chemotherapy efﬂux, is to
increase futile PGP activity during chemotherapy intervals.
Unlike previous MDR-modulating therapies, our approach
does not require that PGP be the sole mechanism of drug
resistance, but simply one of the mechanisms.
To test our hypothesis, we built a computational model of
hypothetical patients with different initial prevalence of PGP
mutant clones. We parameterized the model using in vitro
studies of the breast cancer cell MCF-7 and a related chemoresistant line overexpressing PGP pumps (MCF-7/Dox). We ﬁnd
MCF-7/Dox consumes more energy than its parental cell line
(MCF-7), as previously determined for other PGP mutant cell
lines (14, 15, 18), and that this higher energetic need is
supplemented by anaerobic glycolysis. Our results also conﬁrm
that glucose restriction, in combination with the PGP substrate
verapamil, increases doubling time (from 22 to 51 hours) in
PGPþ mutants. These results suggest that the combination of
energy depletion and increased energy usage through administration PGP substrates synergistically reduce the growth of
MDR subpopulations.
Our simulations show that, in patients with a PGPþ tumor
burden lower than 10%, AT combined with a glycolytic antimetabolite (2-deoxyglucose), and a PGP substrate (verapamil)
signiﬁcantly increases observed survival, whereas in patients
with smaller drug resistant burdens, this evolutionary double
bind strategy can stabilize tumor burden for a period 10-fold
longer than standard MTD (Fig. 5).
The percentage of PGPþ mutants in our simulations was
estimated from 3 clinical trials with breast cancer patients,
which have estimated PGPþ prevalence in untreated patients
from undetectable (27) to below 10% (23, 28). Moreover, these
pumps were shown to be functional and to confer drug
resistance ex vivo (28). The presence of PGPþ cells was also

detected in the surrounding desmoplastic stroma of breast
cancer patients (29), and in combination with positive PGP
tumor cells, correlated with poor prognosis. It is unclear if the
stroma actually produces these pumps by inﬂuence of the
tumor, if they are produced and shed by the PGPþ tumor cells,
or if the mesenchymal cells are actually cancer phenotypes
that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (30). The actual effect of these stromal pumps in protecting the tumor is a subject of debate, as some authors have
proposed that, whereas PGP expression reduces the intracellular drug accumulation, it actually increases its penetration
into tissue and tumor (31, 32). The effect of stromal PGP
expression in the competition of PGPþ and PGP cells should
be subject of investigation in a more suitable spatial model in
the future.
Computational simulations of hypothetical patients treated
with standard MTD, AT, and AT combined with nonchemotherapeutic PGP substrates and 2-deoxyglucose, show dramatic differences in progression-free survival. Compared with
traditional high-dose-density therapy, patients with initial
prevalence of 10% PGPþ cells will have a 2- to 3-fold increase
progression-free survival using AT, and a 4-fold increase
when AT was combined with verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose.
When 5% or fewer drug-resistant cells are initially present,
progression-free survival is improved by a factor of 4 with AT,
and by a factor of 10 with the AT/ verapamil/2-deoxyglucose
combination.
The chronic combined doses of 2-DG/verapamil proposed in
this manuscript were 5 mmol/L per 0.1 umol/L, respectively,
which would be sufﬁcient to mimic in blood the results from
the low glucose–culture media. Clinical trials with glioblastoma
patients have reached weekly boluses as high as 1.25 mmol/L
for up to 7 weeks (33), whereas chronic administration of 2-DG
at 0.18 mmol/L was achieved in a clinical trial with patients with
solid tumors (34). Similar to chemotherapeutic agents, the
chronic administration of glycolytic inhibitors may cause toxicity to healthy tissues. In the case of 2-DG the most affected
would be the brain, retinae, and other organs with known high
glucose consumption (35). Dietary interventions, such as reduction in carbohydrate uptake, as well as increases in the doses of
verapamil, can be envisioned as alternative ways of reaching
the same goal of cost of resistance of PGPþ mutants.
For the sake of simplicity, the computational model
assumed that the conversion rate of chemosensitive cells into
PGPþ chemoresistant cells was negligible. While it is difﬁcult
to determine the spontaneous and drug-induced mutation rate
in patients, in vitro experiments have suggested this conversion
rate is about 1.8  106/generation (36). When this spontaneous rate of conversion from a sensitive to a resistant state is
added to the original simulations, the progression-free survival
and observed survival from the example in Fig. 5 are reduced
from 500 and 590 days, respectively, to 475 and 560 days,
respectively.
As a next step, the approach here proposed will be tested in
mouse models (Nu/Nu) using the same cell lines (MCF-7 and
MCF-7/Dox) with doxorubicin as chemotherapeutic agent in
combination with verapamil and 2-deoxyglucose. A mixed
population of tumor cells will be injected in the mammary

Prolonging Progression-Free Survival in Breast Cancer

fat pad and the tumor volume will be monitored by caliper
measurements and ultrasound.
In summary, we investigate an alternative cancer treatment strategy that is explicitly designed to maintain a
residual population of therapy-sensitive cancer cells so that
they can use their ﬁtness advantage to suppress proliferation
of resistant phenotypes. Essentially, we accept the continued
presence of cells that we can potentially kill so that they can
reduce the growth of populations that we cannot, and could
ultimately lead to patient death. We have previously shown,
using computational models and in vivo experiments, that
this approach prolongs survival, while using lower drug
doses, so that quality of life is high. Here, we hypothesize
that the addition of nonchemotherapy PGP substrates,
between treatments, will further burden the chemoresistant
clones and increase their relative ﬁtness disadvantage, when
compared with chemosensitive cells. We show, using
computational models parameterized by in vitro studies
with clinically available drugs, that this approach can potentially increase the time to tumor recurrence in breast cancer
patients by 4- to 10-fold.
