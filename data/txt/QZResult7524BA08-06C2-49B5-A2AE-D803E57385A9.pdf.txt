Abstract
Despite the promise of radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD20
antibodies (Ab) for the treatment of relapsed patients with
indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), most patients treated
with conventional doses of 131I-tositumomab or 90Y-ibritumomab eventually relapse. We did comparative assessments
using conventional radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20,
CD22, and HLA-DR on human Ramos, Raji, and FL-18
lymphoma xenografts in athymic mice to assess the potential
for improving the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy by targeting other NHL cell surface antigens. Results of biodistribution
studies showed significant differences in tumor localization
consistent with variable antigenic expression on the different
lymphoma cell lines. Interestingly, the radioimmunoconjugate
that yielded the best tumor-to-normal organ ratios differed in
each tumor model. We also explored administering all three
111
In-1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane N,N¶,N ¶¶,N-tetraacetic acid antibodies in combination, but discovered, surprisingly, that
this approach did not augment the localization of radioactivity
to tumors compared with the administration of the best single
radiolabeled Ab alone. These data suggest that conventional
radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD20, anti–HLA-DR, or antiCD22 Abs is effective when used singly and provides targeted
uptake of radiolabel into the tumor that is dependent on the
levels of antigen expression. Improvements in tumorto-normal organ ratios of radioactivity cannot be achieved
using directly labeled Abs in combination but may be afforded
by novel pretargeting methods. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5921–8]

Introduction
Immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies (Ab) targeting
B-cell surface antigens have been widely accepted for the treatment
of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), with anti-CD20 Abs being most
commonly employed (1). Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 Ab,
has provided the best clinical results to date with single-agent
remission induction rates of >60% in patients with indolent
lymphomas and 30% to 35% in relapsed aggressive lymphomas
(2–4). Despite the promise of therapy with unmodified Abs, only
6% to 20% of patients achieve complete remissions (CR) and
most patients treated with an anti-CD20 Ab alone relapse (5). To
overcome the potential limitations of unconjugated Abs, anti-

CD20 Abs conjugated to 131I or 90Y have been tested and shown
to produce higher overall response and CR rates compared with
unlabeled Abs (6–9). The majority of patients treated with
conventional doses of radiolabeled anti-CD20 Abs, however, also
eventually relapse. Escalating the dose of targeted radioimmunotherapy to myeloablative levels has further improved response rates.
Objective remissions have been seen in 85% to 95% of relapsed
lymphoma patients receiving high-dose 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar),
including CR rates of 75% to 80% (10–13). This myeloablative
approach, however, has relied on autologous stem cell transplantation to reconstitute hematopoiesis, and while effective, the
toxicity associated with the transplantation is substantial.
In addition to targeting the CD20 antigen for Ab-mediated
immunotherapy of B-cell lymphomas, several Abs targeting other
B-cell surface antigens have been tested either alone or conjugated
to radionuclides. Radiolabeled Ab conjugates targeting the CD19
antigen have been explored in preliminary radioimmunotherapy
trials (14). Radioimmunotherapy with anti-idiotypic Abs have
shown promise, but have not been widely investigated because of
logistic and financial issues related to the production of patientspecific Abs (15). Prior reports have shown that CD20, CD22, and
HLA-DR are all expressed at relatively high densities on the
majority of B-cell lymphomas (16, 17). The Lym-1 Ab targeting a
class II HLA-DR antigen and LL2/epratuzumab targeting CD22
have had the most success in radioimmunotherapy clinical trials
(18–23). In this report, we have compared CD20, CD22, and
HLA-DR targeting with directly labeled Abs, either singly or in
combination, to determine whether we can further improve tumorto-normal organ ratios, and thus potentially achieve the excellent
outcomes of high-dose radioimmunotherapy without the attendant
toxicities. We have done comparative biodistribution experiments
using conventional one-step radioimmunotherapy in athymic mice
bearing either Burkitt’s (Ramos and Raji) or transformed follicular
(FL-18) lymphoma xenografts. In vitro cell binding experiments
suggest that significant associations exist between levels of CD22,
CD20, and HLA-DR expression. In vivo biodistributions of the
radioimmunoconjugates targeting these same antigens suggest that
the optimal target may vary among different lymphoma cell lines.
Moreover, we show that a combination of directly labeled Abs
targeting the CD20, CD22, and HLA-DR antigens on the surface of
Ramos, Raji, and FL18 lymphoma cells does not provide any
additional benefit over targeting each antigen alone. These results
suggest that the slow clearance of unbound radiolabeled Abs
from the circulation and the resultant high levels of background
radioactivity remain major obstacles to the optimal implementation of radioimmunotherapy in NHL because these pharmacokinetic features limit the tumor-to-normal organ ratios of absorbed
radiation that can be achieved.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human Ramos and Raji Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The
transformed follicular FL-18 cell line was a gift from David Maloney [Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), Seattle, WA]. Cell lines were
maintained as previously described (24). Cell viability exceeded 95% by
trypan blue exclusion.
Antibodies and production of DOTA-Ab conjugates. The 1F5
hybridoma cell line expressing the murine immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a)
antihuman CD20 Ab was a gift from Clay Siegall (Seattle Genetics,
Seattle, WA). The HD39 hybridoma expressing the murine IgG1
antihuman CD22 Ab was a gift from Edward Clark (University of
Washington, Seattle, WA). A Lym-1 hybridoma expressing murine IgG2a
anti–HLA-DR Ab and a hybridoma expressing a nonspecific IgG2a
negative control Ab, HB-8181, were obtained from ATCC. The HD39 Ab
was produced by injecting the hybridoma into pristane-primed mice to
generate ascites. The Ab was purified by protein A immunoabsorption
column chromatography. All other Abs were produced from the
respective hybridomas using a hollow fiber bioreactor system in the
monoclonal Ab production facility at the FHCRC. DOTA-Ab reagents
were conjugated as described previously (24).
Radiolabeling. 111In (Nordion) radiolabeling of intact 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane N,N¶,N ¶¶,N¶¶¶-tetraacetic acid antibodies (DOTA-Abs) for
conventional radioimmunotherapy was done as described (24). Radiochemical purity was typically >99% as determined by HPLC, and labeling
efficiencies were >90%. DOTA-biotin was synthesized as described (24).
Cytometric cell binding analysis of 1F5, HD39, and Lym-1 Abs.
Ramos, Raji, or FL18 cells (1  106) in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-PBS
were incubated with 10 Ag of each DOTA-Ab conjugate for 30 min at 4jC
and washed with 2% FBS-PBS. A second incubation for 30 min at 4jC was
done using 5 Ag of secondary Ab, horse anti-mouse FITC. Following a
second wash, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and
analyzed in a FACScan II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Labware).
Mean fluorescence intensity was determined using CellQuest Pro 5.2
software.
Mouse studies. Female BALB/c nu/nu mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks, were
obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and Charles River Laboratories and
housed under protocols approved by the FHCRC Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Ramos, Raji, or FL18 cells (1–1.2  107) were injected
s.c. in the right flank f10 days before therapy to obtain lymphoma
xenografts. Mice with similar, palpable tumors were chosen for the studies.
For single Ab biodistribution studies, mice were injected i.v. via the tail vein
with 1.4 nmol of radioiodinated Ab (215 Ag; 50 ACi). For combination
studies, tumor xenograft–bearing mice were coinjected with an equimolar
mix (1.4 nmol of each conjugate) of all three conjugates (4.2 nmol of total
conjugates). In each experiment, mice were also coinjected with 400 Ag of
an irrelevant IgG2a Ab (HB8181) to block nonspecific binding of the 1F5,
HD39, and Lym-1 Abs to Fc receptors (25). Mice were bled from the retroorbital venous plexus, euthanized, and tumors and normal organs (lung,
liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys, small intestine, and colon) were harvested,
weighed, and gamma counted for 111In activity 24 and 48 h after the 111InDOTA-Ab injections. The percent-injected dose of 111In per gram (%ID/g) of
blood, tumor, and normal organs was calculated after correcting for
radioactive decay using an aliquot of the injectate. Tumor-to-normal organ
ratios of absorbed radioactivity were also calculated. Control groups were
injected with radiolabeled isotype-matched, nonbinding control 111InDOTA-HB8181 Ab conjugate.

lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 1). The DOTA-1F5 Ab bound to Ramos
cells with the highest mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), whereas
the DOTA-Lym-1 and DOTA-HD39 Abs exhibited MFIs that were
22% and 13%, respectively, of the DOTA-1F5 Ab value. In
contrast, the highest level of binding to Raji cells was seen using
the DOTA-Lym-1 Ab, followed by the DOTA-1F5 Ab (MFI, 33% of
DOTA-Lym-1 MFI). The DOTA-HD39 Ab conjugate exhibited
minimal binding to Raji cells (4% of DOTA-Lym-1 MFI). The
DOTA-Lym-1 and DOTA-1F5 Ab conjugates bound the FL-18 cell
at comparable high levels, whereas the DOTA-HD39 anti-CD22
Ab exhibited a MFI >90% lower than the mean MFI of the other
two Abs.

Comparative Biodistributions of 111In in TumorBearing Mice Treated with Directly Labeled
111
In-DOTA-1F5, 111In-DOTA-HD39, or
111
In-DOTA-Lym-1 Abs
Groups of five mice were injected i.v. with either 1.4 nmol of
directly labeled 111In-DOTA-1F5, 111In-DOTA-Lym-1, or 111InDOTA-HD39 Ab. Mice receiving each 111In-DOTA-Ab were also
coinjected with 400 Ag of a control IgG2a Ab, HB-8181, to prevent
nonspecific binding of each DOTA-Ab to Fc-receptors in the
spleen and marrow (25). Mice were sacrificed 24 and 48 h following
111
In-DOTA-Ab (Fig. 2) administration. At each time point, control
animals injected with the nonbinding 111In-DOTA-HB8181 Ab
had negligible tumor uptake of radioactivity in Ramos, Raji, and
FL-18 xenografts (2.0 F 1.3%, 2.6 F 0.7%, 1.2 F 0.3% ID/g at
48 h, respectively), demonstrating the specificity of targeting
(Fig. 2D).
Anti-CD20 conventional radioimmunotherapy: 111In-DOTA1F5 targeting Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 xenografts in athymic
mice. Similar biodistributions of 111In were obtained in Ramos,
Raji, and FL-18 tumors following conventional radioimmunotherapy employing 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab (Fig. 2A). After 24 and 48 h, peak
levels in Ramos tumors were 6.0 F 2.3% ID/g and 4.8 F 2.0% ID/g
with 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab, respectively. In Raji tumor xenografts,
uptakes at 24 and 48 h were 9.2 F 1.6% and 9.7 F 2.6% ID/g,
respectively, whereas in FL-18 tumor xenografts, 111In-DOTA-1F5
Ab resulted in 7.2 F 2.0% and 7.1 F 2.2% ID/g at 24 and 48 h,
respectively. The levels of radioactivity in normal organs at 24 h
using directly labeled 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab ranged from 0.8% ID/g

Results
In vitro Binding of Anti-CD20, Anti-CD22, and Anti–
HLA-DR Abs to Human Lymphoma Cells
The anti-CD20, anti-CD22, and anti–HLA-DR DOTA-Ab conjugates were tested for binding to the FL18, Ramos, and Raji cell
lines by flow cytometry. These studies showed that the DOTA-Ab
conjugates displayed different binding patterns on the three

Figure 2. Biodistributions of radioactivity in blood, tumors, and normal organs of athymic mice bearing Ramos, Raji, or FL18 xenografts and injected with either
111
In-DOTA-1F5 (A), 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 (B ), 111In-DOTA-HD39 (C), or negative control antibody 111In-DOTA-HB8181 (D ). Mice were injected i.v. with 1.4 nmol of
one of the four conventional trace-labeled 111In-DOTA-Ab at time = 0 h and euthanized either 24 or 48 h afterward. The radioactivity in blood and tumors was quantified
by gamma counting, corrected for decay, and expressed as the % ID/g of tissue. Each graph shows results at the 48-h time point for Ramos (5), Raji ( ), and FL-18 (n).

in colon to 11.9% ID/g in kidney. In addition, circulating blood
levels of radioactivity after 24 and 48 h were relatively high in mice
receiving 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab. For example, in mice bearing Raji
tumors, levels in blood of 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab were 8.3 F 1.4% and
6.6 F 0.8% ID/g at 24 and 48 h, respectively.
Anti–HLA-DR conventional radioimmunotherapy: 111InDOTA-Lym-1 targeting Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 xenografts in
athymic mice. In a similar manner, we compared 111In-labeled
anti–HLA-DR radioimmunotherapy in mice bearing Ramos, Raji,
or FL-18 human lymphoma xenografts. Mice were treated with
equimolar doses of 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab as described in Materials
and Methods. The amount of radioactivity localizing to Ramos
tumors was considerably less than the amounts in Raji or FL-18
tumors when the 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab was employed for tumor
targeting (Fig. 2B). Consistent with antigenic expression patterns
for these cell lines (Fig. 1), peak radioactivity levels 24 h after
delivery of 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab in Raji and FL-18 tumors were
12.3 F 3.1% and 13.7 F 3.4% ID/g, respectively. By comparison,
biodistributions of radioactivity seen in Ramos tumors were
3.5 F 0.6% ID/g at 24 h using the 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab. Directly
labeled 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab yielded tumor uptakes of 14.7 F 3.9%

and 11.5 F 5.6% ID/g uptake in Raji and FL-18 tumors at 48 h,
respectively, but only 4.8 F 2.5% ID/g uptake in Ramos tumors at
the same time point (Fig. 2B).
Anti-CD22 conventional radioimmunotherapy: 111In-DOTAHD39 targeting Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 xenografts in athymic
mice. Because most anti-CD22 Abs are rapidly internalized into
mature and malignant B lymphocytes after binding to cell surface
CD22 (17), we investigated if the short residence time of anti-CD22
(HD39) Ab on the cell surface would affect the ability to localize
111
In-DOTA-HD39 Ab to Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 tumor xenografts
(Fig. 2C). Localization of radioactivity to Ramos xenografts using
111
In-DOTA-HD39 Ab was near background at 24 h (2.2 F 0.4%
ID/g) and 48 h (2.5 F 0.1% ID/g). In contrast, the use of 111InDOTA-HD39 Ab resulted in uptakes of 6.1 F 1.2% ID/g in Raji
tumors and 9.7 F 4.0% ID/g in FL18 tumors at 24 h. The
corresponding 48-h uptakes were 7.3 F 0.6% ID/g in Raji tumors
and 7.3 F 1.0% ID/g in FL18 tumors (Fig. 2C).

radiation to determine if additive or synergistic effects could be
imparted to Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 tumor xenografts, we did
combination experiments targeting all three antigenic sites
simultaneously. Equimolar amounts of each directly labeled 111InDOTA-Ab conjugate were coinjected into tumor-bearing mice.
Therefore, the total amount of each individual conjugate was
equivalent to the amount used in the single-agent biodistribution
experiments, and thus, thrice the total amount of protein was
used in directly labeled combination experiments. As before, the
HB8181 control Ab was coinjected to block nonspecific Fc receptor
interaction of the IgG2a DOTA conjugates. The combination of
111
In-DOTA-1F5, 111In-DOTA-Lym-1, and 111In-DOTA-HD39 Abs did
not achieve additive levels of radioactivity in any of the three types
of tumor xenografts (Fig. 3). For example, the combination of the
three radiolabeled DOTA-Ab conjugates in mice bearing Ramos
tumors resulted in tumor biodistributions that were similar to the
single doses of each DOTA-Ab conjugate, yielding 7.5 F 5.3% ID/g
with the conjugate combination at 48 h compared with 4.8 F 2.0%
ID/g using 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab alone, 4.8 F 2.5% ID/g using 111InDOTA-Lym-1 Ab alone, and 2.5 F 0.1% ID/g with 111In-DOTA-HD39
alone (Fig. 3A). Similarly, mice bearing Raji tumors treated with
the triple (i.e., 4.2 nmol) 111In-DOTA-Ab combination had a tumor
concentration of 9.4 F 2.5% ID/g at 48 h compared with 9.7 F 2.6%,
14.7 F 4.9%, and 7.3 F 0.6% ID/g in Raji tumors after 48 h when
111
In-DOTA-1F5 Ab, 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab, or 111In-DOTA-HD39
Ab were used as single agents, respectively (Fig. 3B). Using FL-18
tumors, mice that received the 111In-DOTA triple-Ab combination
accumulated 11.2 F 7.2% ID/g in tumor after 48 h compared with
7.1 F 2.2% (DOTA-1F5 Ab), 11.5 F 5.6% ID/g (DOTA-Lym-1 Ab),
and 7.3 F 1.0% (DOTA-HD39) in tumors of mice receiving the
three DOTA-Ab conjugates singly (Fig. 3C).
The data from the combination studies suggest that there may
be a significant increase in the amount of radioactivity deposited in
normal organs compared with normal organ doses delivered when
each DOTA-Ab conjugate was used separately. In mice bearing
Ramos tumors, the concentration of radioactivity in the liver was
7.8 F 2.8% ID/g after 48 h compared with a lower concentration
when each DOTA-Ab conjugate was used individually (3.7 F 0.3%
ID/g in liver; Fig. 3A). Thus, for the Ramos model, the increased
radiation delivered to normal organs using the combination of
radioimmunoconjugates may lead to increased toxicities compared
with the use of the individual DOTA-Ab conjugates, without a
commensurate increase in the delivery of radioactivity to tumor
sites.

labeled 111In-DOTA-1F5, 111In-DOTA-HD39, and 111In-DOTALym-1 Abs and comparison to ratios obtained using pretargeted radioimmunotherapy. The distributions of radioactivity
delivered to normal organs were compared between 111In-DOTAAbs among Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 xenografts. The amount of
radioactivity remained high in the blood for prolonged periods
following the administration of each 111In-DOTA-Ab. The amount
of 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab remaining in the blood of mice with FL-18
tumors after 24 h was 20.3 F 12.7% ID/g, and the circulating level
of the 111In-DOTA-1F5 Ab was 15.0 F 4.0% ID/g in the blood of
FL-18 tumor-bearing mice after 48 h (Fig. 2A). This relatively slow
clearance of unbound radiolabeled Abs from the circulation for
each 111In-DOTA-Ab resulted in high levels of background radiation
doses delivered to the normal organs of mice bearing Ramos, Raji,
or FL-18 tumors. Consequently, these pharmacokinetic features
using directly labeled Abs limited the tumor-to-normal organ ratios

For the combination studies, mice bearing Ramos (A ), Raji (B), or FL-18 (C )
tumor xenografts were simultaneously injected i.v. with a combination of 1.4 nmol
each of 111In-DOTA-1F5, 111In-DOTA-Lym-1, and 111In-DOTA-HD39 Abs.
Mice were euthanized 24 and 48 h after injection of the 111In-DOTA-Ab cocktail,

all three xenograft models tested, with tumor-to-stomach ratios at
48 h of 11:1 in both Ramos (Fig. 4A) and Raji (Fig. 4B), and 7.3:1 in
FL-18 (Fig. 4C). Similarly, tumor-to-kidney ratios were 1.5:1 in

Ramos and 1.2:1 in both Raji and FL-18 tumors. Conversely, tumorto-normal organ ratios using 111In-DOTA-Lym-1 Ab were best in
the mice bearing Raji xenografts where the tumor-to-stomach and
tumor-to-kidney ratios were 21:1 and 3:1, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Ratios were least favorable in mice that received the 111In-DOTAHD39 Ab; animals bearing FL-18 tumor xenografts that received
111
In-DOTA-HD39 Ab had a tumor-to-stomach ratio of 4.7:1 and
tumor-to-kidney ratio of 0.8:1, respectively (Fig. 4C).

As described in a separate report submitted concurrently with
this study (26) we have explored a pretargeting strategy in an
attempt to decrease the levels of radiolabeled Ab remaining in
the bloodstream before delivery of the therapeutic radionuclide
(27–35). This pretargeted method employs streptavidin conjugated
to the Ab, followed by delivery of a radiolabeled biotin conjugate.
We have also used a biotinylated polymeric, N-acetyl-galactosamine–clearing agent to further decrease the levels of Abstreptavidin conjugate persisting in the circulation before delivery
of the radiobiotin to reduce the nonspecific radiation exposure
from blood-borne radiolabeled Ab. Compared with ratios obtained
using conventional directly labeled anti-CD20, anti–HLA-DR, and
anti-CD22 Abs at 24 and 48 h, pretargeted radioimmunotherapy
using 1F5 Ab-streptavidin, Lym-1 Ab-streptavidin, or the HD39 Abstreptavidin followed by 111In-DOTA-biotin yielded superior tumorto-blood and tumor-to-normal organ ratios of radioactivity due
to the rapid clearance from blood of each conjugate after the
administration of the clearing agent (Fig. 5). In contrast to the
conventional radioimmunotherapy biodistribution experiments, a
maximum of only 2.3 F 0.8% ID/g was present in blood after
24 h using any of the pretargeted Ab-streptavidin conjugates,
decreasing to a maximum of 1.3 F 0.8% ID/g in blood after 48 h.
Ratios were most favorable using the pretargeted Lym-1 Abstreptavidin conjugate in mice bearing FL18 tumor xenografts
(Fig. 5B). Using the pretargeting approach with the Lym-1 Abstreptavidin, the tumor-to-blood ratio after 48 h was 23:1 in contrast
to only 1.6:1 when using conventional 111In-Lym-1 Ab. Likewise,
the tumor-to-kidney ratio at 48 h using the pretargeting approach
was 9:1 in comparison to 0.9:1 for conventional 111In-Lym-1 Ab.

Although the CD20 antigen has proven to be a promising target
for radioimmunotherapy for NHL, other Abs targeting B-cell
surface antigens have also been conjugated to radionuclides and
tested for their potential to improve the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy. Goldenberg et al. have evaluated an anti-CD22
90
Y-labeled humanized Ab, epratuzumab, in patients with NHL and
found that this radioimmunoconjugate can result in significant
antitumor responses (22, 23). Interestingly, the accumulation of
90
Y-epratuzumab at tumor sites did not correlate with individual
tumor responses, and the degree of tumor response could not
be predicted based on the estimated tumor dose delivered. These
data suggest that anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy may use other
mechanisms of tumor control, perhaps similar to those mechanisms of antitumor activity seen with the used of unconjugated
B-cell Abs. Class II HLA-DR antigens have also been targeted using
Lym-1 (18–21, 36) and Hu1D10 Abs (37, 38) with success in both
clinical and preclinical studies. DeNardo et al. have shown that
conjugation of a Lym-1 Ab to a radionuclide will augment potency
of chemotherapeutic regimens (39) and other unconjugated Abs
when used in combination (40). Moreover, it was shown that
radiolabeled Lym-1 Ab has the ability to overcome resistance of
unconjugated Abs to lymphoma cells in vitro, suggesting a distinct
therapeutic advantage of radioimmunotherapy compared with the
use of unconjugated Abs in chemoresistant, but radiosensitive
relapsed NHL. Although initial clinical investigations of anti–HLADR radioimmunotherapy used Lym-1 Ab conjugated to 131I, recent
explorations have focused on Lym-1 Abs conjugated to either 90Y
(39, 40) or 67Cu (19). In this report, we have compared conventional
radioimmunotherapy approaches targeting the CD20, CD22, and

HLA-DR antigens to determine the most appropriate molecular
target for radioimmunotherapy. We have shown that the effectiveness of the targeting Ab is dependent on the cell surface expression
of each antigen as well as the tumor xenograft employed. The three
radioimmunoconjugates investigated delivered variable doses of
radiation to tumors in vivo, which correlated with the levels
of target antigen expression. For example, the localization of
radioactivity in Raji tumor xenografts was superior using an 111In–

anti–HLA-DR Ab compared with using 111In-Abs targeting CD20 or
CD22. These results were consistent with the higher relative
expression patterns of HLA-DR compared with CD20 and CD22 in
Raji tumor cells. In a similar manner, significantly higher levels of
radioactivity were delivered to Ramos xenografts in vivo using
an 111In–anti-CD20 Ab compared with 111In–anti-CD22 due to
significant differences in the antigenic surface expression levels
for CD20 and CD22 on Ramos cells in vitro. In this study, we also
investigated combining all three directly labeled Abs to determine
if radioimmunotherapy can be further improved by targeting
multiple antigens simultaneously. The results from these studies
surprisingly suggested that the amount of radiation specifically
delivered to tumor sites could not be augmented by using a
combination of all three 111In-labeled Abs at equimolar doses.
When compared with targeting each antigen alone, radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20, CD22, and HLA DR antigens in
combination lead to inferior tumor-to-normal organ ratios due
to the relatively high background exposure of normal organs to
radioactivity. Although we have seen no evidence of cross-blocking
or steric hindrance in preliminary studies among simultaneously
bound Ab molecules,5 it is possible that down-modulation of antigenic expression may be partially responsible for the results
observed with Ab combinations as shown by Carnahan et al. (41, 42).
Several recent studies have documented the promise of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy as a method to improve target-tonontarget organ ratios of absorbed radiation compared with ratios
obtained using conventional radioimmunotherapy. Pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy attempts to limit the radiation exposure of
normal organs and, thus, the attendant associated toxicities, while
maintaining or amplifying the delivery of radiation therapy to tumor
sites (35). Our group and others have studied a novel pretargeting
approach using Ab constructs conjugated to streptavidin that bind
to radiolabeled biotin as a means to improve target-to-nontarget
ratios of absorbed radiation doses. This is accomplished by reducing
the relatively protracted circulating half-life of conventional radiolabeled Abs that results in nonspecific exposure of normal organs to
radioactivity (24, 25, 31, 43–46). This pretargeted radioimmunotherapy approach has been shown to improve the ratios of radiation
delivered to tumors compared with normal organs in both
preclinical and clinical models of solid tumors as well as
hematologic malignancies. In particular, we have shown reduced
toxicity and markedly enhanced efficacy using pretargeted antiCD20 Ab-streptavidin conjugate compared with directly labeled
anti-CD20 Ab in mouse lymphoma xenograft studies (25, 47).
Pantelias et al. explored the use of anti-CD20, anti-CD22, and anti–
HLA-DR Ab-streptavidin conjugates for pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (26). As seen with the conventional radioimmunotherapy
results presented in this study, the best tumor uptake and tumor-tonormal organ ratios of radioactivity varied depending on the target
antigen expression of the cell line employed. The best tumor-tonormal organ ratios of absorbed radioactivity using the pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy approach were also observed when single Abstreptavidin conjugates were employed rather than combination
therapy with all three conjugates. We report here our comparison of
the one-step conventional radioimmunotherapy and pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy approaches for targeting the CD20, CD22, and
HLA-DR antigens by evaluating tumor-to-normal organ ratios of
radioactivity (Fig. 5). The results presented in this study confirm the

advantages of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy compared with
conventional radioimmunotherapy. The significant improvement in
the therapeutic index for lymphoma therapy using pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy is due to the rapid clearance of each Abstreptavidin constructs from the blood and nonspecific normal
organs compared with the slow clearances observed with conventional radioimmunotherapy.
Despite the promise of pretargeting, however, additional
variables must be considered to optimally improve the efficacy of
radioimmunotherapy. These parameters include the accessibility,
shedding, cell surface density, and heterogeneity of expression of
the targeted antigen. The binding site specificity, immunoreactivity,
in vivo stability, avidity, and affinity of the monoclonal Ab also are
likely to be critical factors in determining the maximal effectiveness of radioimmunotherapy. B-cell antigens on the surface of
human lymphoma cells have been shown to have distinct variation
among several B cell–specific Abs in their rates of internalization,
degradation, and dissociation from the cell surface (16, 17). For
example, prior studies targeting the CD45 antigen have indicated
that an anti-CD45 Ab was minimally internalized or shed from the
cell surface. This was in contrast to the cell surface retention of an
anti-CD20 Ab that was minimally internalized, but displayed a
significant rate of passive dissociation from the surface of human
lymphoma cells. Preliminary radioimmunotherapy studies using
CD45 targeting have yielded comparable results to those achievable
with anti-CD20 Ab-mediated radioimmunotherapy in murine
preclinical models due, at least in part, to the properties of the
target antigen at the cell surface (24).
We and others have used radiolanthanides as the radiolabel in
radioimmunotherapy models because of the experience with these
radionuclides and the appeal for therapeutic administrations
brought about by their ease of use in outpatient nonmyeloablative
settings. Preclinical and clinical studies using 90Y have suggested
improved therapeutic ratios due to its higher energy and shorter
half-life (2.7 days) compared with other h-emitting radionuclides
such as 131I, which has a longer a physical half-life (8.1 days) and
problematic gamma rays. Although most radiolanthanides emit
gamma rays, their emission energies do not require isolation
of patients. In fact, some radiolanthanides, such as 177Lu, have
gamma emissions that allow imaging on standard gamma cameras.
Although greater h-ray tissue penetration may be highly favorable
for deposition of radiation in large tumor masses, this factor must
be balanced by the desire to limit localization of the radiation
effects to antigen-positive cells and to avoid unduly irradiating
the normal bystander cells. In an attempt to avoid the relative

nonspecific cytotoxicity of h-emitting constructs due to the crossfire effect, the a emitters 213Bi and 225Ac that have shorter path
lengths (Am) have recently been explored as radiolabels to treat
hematologic malignancies (48, 49). Bismuth-labeled biotin has been
investigated in pretargeting radioimmunotherapy experiments
targeting human carcinoma xenografts that resulted in significantly
higher tumor-to-nontumor targeting ratios than those achieved
with a directly labeled Ab (50). Despite the therapeutic effect seen
using 213Bi-DOTA-biotin, however, the main toxicity was renal,
suggesting that renal protection agents may be useful in this setting.
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of screening
the antigenic expression on lymphomas to select the most
superior reagents for radioimmunotherapy. Radioimmunotherapy
targeting of tumor masses with anti-CD20, anti-CD22, and anti–
HLA-DR Abs results in rapid and high concentration of
radioactivity into tumor where the ability of each radioimmunoconjugates to localize to human NHL tumors in vivo is dependent
on the antigenic expression on the NHL cell surface. This study
also provides data relevant to clinical situations suggesting that
the biology of the lymphoma tumor type and the specific antigenAb combination employed are critical for achieving the most
favorable therapeutic ratios. These results further suggest that
combinations of radiolabeled Abs may not be superior over the
use of a single radioimmunoconjugate and may not be warranted
in the clinical arena. The amount of radiation that can be
delivered to these single target antigens using a directly labeled
Ab, however, will still be limited by toxicities due to the
suboptimal therapeutic index (target-to-nontarget ratio) currently
achievable with conventional radioimmunotherapy methodologies.
Therefore, in view of the compelling advantages for pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy to further improve this index, we have begun
translating this approach to human studies. Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy has the potential to allow for delivery of higher
absorbed radiation doses to target tissues with minimal increase
in toxicity, and such a result could diminish relapse rates leading
to improved survival.
