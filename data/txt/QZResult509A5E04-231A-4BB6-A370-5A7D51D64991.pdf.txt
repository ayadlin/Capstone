Abstract
Chloroethylureas (CEU) are soft alkylating agents that
covalently bind to B-tubulin (BTAC) and affect microtubule
polymerization dynamics. Herein, we report the identification
of a CEU subset and its corresponding oxazolines, which
induce cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, and microtubule
disruption without alkylating B-tubulin (N-BTAC). Both
BTAC and N-BTAC trigger the collapse of mitochondrial
potential (#W m) and modulate reactive oxygen species levels,
following activation of intrinsic caspase-8 and caspase-9.
Experiments using human fibrosarcoma HT1080 respiratorydeficient cells (R0) and uncoupler of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain (MRC) showed that BTAC and N-BTAC
impaired the MRC. R0 cells displayed an increased sensitivity
toward N-BTAC as compared with R+ cells but, in contrast,
were resistant to BTAC or classic chemotherapeutics, such as
paclitaxel. Oxazoline-195 (OXA-195), an N-BTAC derivative,
triggered massive swelling of isolated mitochondria. This
effect was insensitive to cyclosporin A and to Bcl-2 addition. In
contrast, adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) antagonists,
bongkrekic acid or atractyloside, diminished swelling induced
by OXA-195. The antiproliferative activities of the N-BTACs
CEU-025 and OXA-152 were markedly decreased in the
presence of atractyloside. Conversely, pretreatment with
cyclosporin A enhanced growth inhibition induced by BTAC
and N-BTAC. One of the proteins alkylated by N-BTAC was
identified as the voltage-dependent anion channel isoform-1,
an ANT partner. Our results suggest that BTAC and N-BTAC,
despite their common ability to affect the microtubule
network, trigger different cytotoxic mechanisms in cancer
cells. The role of mitochondria in these mechanisms and the
potential of N-BTAC as a new therapeutic approach for
targeting hypoxia-resistant cells are discussed. [Cancer Res

resistant tumor cells, and have limited toxic effects. To that end, we
developed over the past decade a new class of antimitotics called
N-phenyl-N¶-2-(chloroethyl)ureas (CEU). CEU inhibits the growth
of numerous tumors and drug-resistant cell lines (1–5). N[4-Iodophenyl]-N¶-(2-chloroethyl)ureas (CEU-098) and N-[4-(1,1dimethylethyl)-phenyl]-N ¶-(2-chloroethyl)urea (CEU-022) were
found to block the migration of cancer cells in vitro and display
antitumor and antiangiogenic properties in vivo (4, 6). CEUs are
nonmutagenic monoalkylating agents that are unreactive toward
most cellular nucleophiles, such as glutathione and DNA (2, 7).
Protein extracts from cells exposed to [14C]CEU-022 showed that
the drug covalently binds to a limited number of proteins, notably
h-tubulin isoform-2 (8). Competition experiments confirmed that
CEU-022 and several derivatives bind to the colchicine-binding site
and disrupt the microtubule network (8) to block the cell division
in G2/M phase (8). These CEUs are members of a molecular subset
that hereafter is designated as hTAC.
Apoptosis is one of the mechanisms by which chemotherapeutic
agents induce cancer cell demise. The mitochondrion acts as a
convergent point at which the signaling pathways integrate and
trigger apoptosis, as shown with various anticancer agents.
The mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway results from a
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition of the outer
mitochondrial membrane culminating in the release of proapoptotic proteins in the cytosol, such as cytochrome c (9). One of the
mechanisms leading to membrane permeability transition is the
formation of a permeability transition pore (PTP; ref. 10). PTP
opening is known to occur in response to different stimuli, such as
increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial calcium overload, thiol oxidation, adenine nucleotide
depletion, and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential
(DW m; ref. 10). Specific contacts between the voltage-dependent
anion channel isoform-1 (VDAC-1), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and cyclophilin D are believed to constitute the
backbone of PTP (11). Members of the Bcl-2 protein family, which
act as checkpoints of apoptosis, play a key role in the membrane
permeability transition process (12) and regulate PTP opening/
closing in concert with VDAC and ANT (13). Several molecules
such as cyclosporin A have been shown to modulate PTP opening
and used to decipher its regulation (14).
Chemotherapeutics such as arsenite and lonidamine were found
to be direct PTP opening agents (15). For instance, the
mitochondrion is recognized as an important target for the
development of new anticancer agents (15). Moreover, several lines
of evidence suggest that mitochondria of transformed cells exhibit
alterations that can be exploited to selectively induce their demise.
For example, an increased binding of hexokinase-2 with VDAC-1 is
observed in tumor cells, which alleviates survival of cancer cells
in hypoxic conditions (16). Inhibition of hexokinase activity by
3-bromopyruvate or decreased binding of hexokinase-2 to VDAC-1

increases the susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics
(17) and hypoxia (18).
In this work, we report the identification of a subset of cytotoxic
CEUs and their corresponding oxazolines that do not alkylate htubulin (N-hTAC). N-hTACs have an increased cytotoxicity on
hypoxia-resistant fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells generated by mitochondrial DNA depletion. VDAC-1 was identified as a target of NhTAC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and chemicals. Nonradioactive CEU and oxazoline derivatives
(Table 1) were kindly provided by Dr. Jean Rousseau from IMOTEP, Inc.
(Québec, Canada). The synthesis of [14C]CEU-025 and [14C]CEU-027 was
carried out as previously described (19). All other drugs and reagents were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All drugs assessed in this study were

dissolved in DMSO and used at a final concentration of <0.19% (v/v). The
human Bcl-2 recombinant protein used (Sigma) is a 68-kDa fusion protein
composed of a maltose binding protein moiety followed by a histidine tag
and a Bcl-2 protein lacking 21 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus.
Cell lines. Human colon carcinoma HT29, breast carcinoma MDAMB-231, human fibrosarcoma HT1080, and murine melanoma M21 cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM (Hyclone, Road Logan, UT)
supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum. Wild-type (wt) Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-10001), colchicine/vinblastine–resistant
cells (CHO-VV 3-2), and paclitaxel-resistant cells (CHO-TAX 5-6) were
generously provided by Dr. Fernando Cabral (University of Texas
Medical School, Houston, TX) and cultured as previously described (8).
HT1080 cells partially depleted of mitochondrial DNA were obtained by
maintaining wt HT1080 cells for 4 weeks in the presence of 100 ng/mL
ethidium bromide in the culture medium supplemented with 300 Ag/mL
uridine and 2 mmol/L Na pyruvate.

Figure 1. Relationship between h-tubulin alkylation potency and cell growth inhibition of CEUs and oxazolines toward different cancer and antimicrotubule-resistant
h-tubulin–mutant CHO cell lines. A, MDA-MB-231 or HT1080 cells were plated and then treated the following day for 48 h with the following concentrations: DMSO,
0.19% (v/v); CEU-022 and CEU-98, 30 Amol/L; CEU-25, CEU-027, and CEU-091, 75 Amol/L; CEU-107R, 10 Amol/L; OXA-152 and OXA-195, 50 Amol/L; CEU-236,
2 Amol/L. After treatment, the cells were harvested as described in Materials and Methods and protein extracts (30 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by
Western blot with h-tubulin antibody. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed for 24 h to 100 Amol/L of [14C]CEU-022, [14C]CEU-025, or [14C]CEU-027. The cells were then
harvested. Protein extracts, equivalent to 1  105 cells, were separated by SDS-PAGE (17.5%), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and autoradiographed
for 13 d. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated 24 h before a 48-h treatment with DMSO (0.19%), the indicated CEU or oxazoline (50 Amol/L), colchicine, or vinblastine
(VBL; 5 Amol/L) in the absence or presence of CEU-022 (30 Amol/L). Total protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis of h-tubulin.
The results show that CEU-022–mediated h-tubulin alkylation is blocked by colchicine (COL ) but not by other compounds tested. Similar results were obtained with
HT1080 cells (data not shown). D, wt (n), CHO-VV 3-2 (.), and CHO-TAX 5-6 (E) h-tubulin–mutant CHO cell lines were exposed for 48 h with increasing
concentrations of CEU-022, CEU-025, CEU-027, OXA-152, and CEU-195 before cell fixation and sulforhodamine B staining for cell growth comparative analysis,
as described in Materials and Methods. Points, mean growth percentage of triplicate 585-nm absorbance for each drug concentration exposure, compared with those
of an untreated control. Representative of two independent experiments.

Growth inhibition and cytotoxicity assays. The sulforhodamine B
growth assay was done as previously reported (4). Cell cytotoxicity was
assessed by the resazurin assay. Cells were seeded onto 96-well microtiter
plates and, 24 h later, exposed for 16 or 48 h to the drugs before the addition
of medium containing resazurin (25 Ag/mL final) for 1 h at 37jC; then,
fluorescence measurements [excitation: 530 (F35) nm, emission: 590 (F25)
nm] were done with a microtiter plate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek FL600,
Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Background fluorescence (BGF) emitted from the
control wells containing medium and resazurin without cells was
subtracted from fluorescence values obtained in the presence of cells. The
percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows: % viability = (mean
fluorescence with drug BGF) / (mean fluorescence without drug BGF)
 100.
Alkylating potency of CEU. The alkylating potency of CEU and
oxazoline versus chlorambucil was determined with the colorimetric assay
previously described (8). The alkylation potency P¶ refers to the percent
kinetics ability of CEU or oxazoline to alkylate 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine
compared with chlorambucil.
Immunocytochemical analysis of microtubule network integrity.
HT1080 cells (8  105) were seeded onto fibronectin 16 h before exposure to
the drugs. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehydePBS for 10 min. After two washes with PBS, fixed cells were permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, washed, then blocked for 30 min (10%
goat serum) before h-tubulin antibody (1:200) incubation for 1 h at room
temperature. After washes, cells were incubated with 1:2,000 dilution of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

antimouse immunoglobulin G Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for
45 min at room temperature. All washes were done in PBS containing 10%
goat serum or in PBS alone. Cells were then mounted on a microscope slide
overnight with slow fade reagent (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) before
analysis under a confocal microscope Eclipse E800 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Evaluation of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c
release was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy as
described for h-tubulin analysis (see above) except that a cytochrome c
antibody was used (1:1,000 dilution; clone no. 6H2.B4, BD PharMingen, SanDiego, CA).
Flow cytometric analysis. Following treatments with oxazoline-195
(OXA-195) or CEU-236 for different periods of time or with DMSO for 24 h,
HT1080 cell pellets (2.5  105) were resuspended in DMEM containing
5 Amol/L hydroethidine and 40 nmol/L DiOC6 to measure ROS production
and DW m, respectively, as described elsewhere (20). After treatment of the
cells with the dyes (30 min/37jC), the cells were placed on ice until analysis.
DNA content cell cycle analysis was done by propidium iodide staining (8).
One-dimensional and isoelectric focusing/two-dimensional SDSPAGE analysis. MDA-MB-231 and HT1080 cells were exposed to different
concentrations of radioactive (or not) CEU or oxazoline. After incubation,
adherent and floating cells were pooled. The cells were pelleted and washed
with PBS before their resuspension in 1 Laemmli buffer containing 5% hmercaptoethanol. The lysates were sonicated for 5 s and boiled for 5 min
before one-dimensional electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing was done with
the Protean IEF Cell apparatus according to the instructions of the

manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Detection of native and alkylated htubulin isoforms is based on a one-dimensional electrophoretic shift assay
(8). The detection of the native and alkylated forms of VDAC-1 was done
with a 1:5,000 dilution of monoclonal anti–VDAC-1 [clone 89-173/033 (ab3)
and 89-173/045 (ab4), Calbiochem, San Diego, CA]. All incubations with
antibodies were done at room temperature for 2 to 3 h in TBS, 0.1% Tween
20 with 1% milk or in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 + 5% bovine serum albumin.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, caspase-8 (clone no. 1C12),
and caspase-9 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly,
MA). Cytochrome oxidase subunit II (clone no. 12C4) and cytochrome
oxidase subunit IV (clone no. 10E8) antibodies were obtained from
Molecular Probes.
Mitochondrial isolation. Rat liver mitochondria were purified by
differential centrifugation and Percoll gradient according to the procedure
reported by Almeida and Medina (21).
Mitochondrial swelling assay. Swelling of rat liver mitochondria was
measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 540 nm.
The mitochondrial suspension consisting of rat liver mitochondria (0.5 mg/
mL) was incubated in the swelling buffer [70 mmol/L sucrose, 214 mmol/L
mannitol, 5 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmol/L NaPO4 (pH 7.4)] with or
without 5 mmol/L glutamate and 2.5 mmol/L sodium malate. The swelling
assays were done at 25jC. Signal decrease at 540 nm is indicative of
mitochondria swelling.
VDAC-1 purification. Transmembrane protein purification was done as
described by de Pinto et al. (22) with minor modifications. Briefly, cultured
cells exposed to CEU-025 were resuspended in PB2 buffer [3% Triton X-100,
10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 tablet of Complete mix of
protease inhibitors (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) per 10 mL of buffer]. The
protein concentration of the extract was adjusted to 5 mg/mL before
applying onto a dry hydroxyapatite/celite (2:1 w/v) column (0.1 g/mg
protein). Two milliliters of PB2 buffer were used for elution of VDAC-1.
VDAC-1 oxidation assay. The capacity of CEU and oxazoline to alkylate
the cysteinyl residues on VDAC-1 was verified using diamide-mediated
oxidation, described elsewhere (23). Total cell or rat liver mitochondria
extracts, exposed or not to CEU in Triton 3% buffer, were denatured with
SDS 1% (10 min/25jC). All denatured samples were then treated for 30 min
with 250 Amol/L diamide. Subsequently, they were boiled in the presence or
absence of h-mercaptoethanol (5%) for SDS-PAGE analysis.

highest cell growth inhibition capacity on several tumor cell
lines (7, 25).
N-BTAC: new CEUs and oxazolines that inhibit cancer cell
growth without alkylating the B-tubulin colchicine-binding
site. Several CEUs were earlier shown to disrupt the cytoskeleton
through their covalent binding to the colchicinoid-binding site
of h-tubulin isoform-2 (8). As shown in Fig. 1A, CEU-022, CEU098, CEU-107R, and CEU-236 covalently bind to h-tubulin, which
leads to the formation of a protein byproduct exhibiting a faster
electrophoretic mobility shift than the native h-tubulin (8).

Results
Comparison of CEU growth inhibition versus alkylating
potency. To optimize the antiproliferative properties of our
prototypical CEU-022 (1, 2, 4–6), several CEUs were prepared by
substituting the alkyl group at the third or fourth position of the
phenyl ring (Table 1). We selected from a CEU library a subset of
9 molecules displaying GI50 ranging from 100 nmol/L to 100
Amol/L and included CEU-091 as a negative control for protein
alkylation. CEU-091 has no chlorine atom and is devoid of both
alkylating and growth inhibition properties on solid tumors cells
(4). CEU-107(R) bears a methyl group (R-enantiomer) on the
ethyl linker arm between the urea moiety and the chlorine atom.
Interestingly, the S-enantiomer has no growth inhibition activity
while having the same electrophilicity (24), thus illustrating the
importance of structure-activity relationships in the design of
novel CEUs. OXA-152 and OXA-195 are ‘‘bioisosteres’’ of CEU-025
and CEU-027, respectively. OXA-152 and OXA-195 are the
cyclized byproducts of the 2-chloroethylamino moiety of CEU
into a 2-oxazoline heterocycle. As shown in Table 1, these
oxazolines exhibit electrophilic properties and antiproliferative
activities similar to or even higher than those of their respective
2-chloroethylurea counterparts. The 4-iodo derivative CEU-098 is
a bioisostere of the 4-tert-butyl moiety designed to improve the
metabolic resistance of CEU-022 (6). Finally, CEU-236, which is a
3-(5-hydroxypentyl) substituted form of CEU, exhibits the

and Methods.

hydroethidine (He ) fluorescence probes,
respectively. The percentages of DiOC6
and hydroethidine histograms indicate the
low and high staining cell populations,
respectively.

CEU-091 is, as expected, neither cytotoxic nor electrophilic (Table 1).
Figure 1A also shows that the electrophoresis of proteins extracted
from cells treated with CEU-025, CEU-027, OXA-152, or OXA-195 at
concentrations higher than their IG50 did not reveal the formation of
any h-tubulin byproducts, suggesting that N-hTAC does not alkylate
h-tubulin. In support of this result, protein extracts from MDA-MB231 cells exposed to [14C]CEU-022, [14C]CEU-025, or [14C]CEU-027
revealed (Fig. 1B) a 50-kDa signal corresponding to the alkylated htubulin byproduct, restricted to[14C]CEU-022 labeling. However,
N-hTAC still might partly act on h-tubulin as reversible instead of
irreversible antagonists of the colchicine-binding site. To address this
issue, we did competition experiments to determine the capacity of
N-hTAC to compete with CEU-022–mediated h-tubulin alkylation.
Colchicine competes with hTAC for the colchicine-binding site (8),
as shown in Fig. 1C. In contrast, neither vinblastine nor any of the
N-hTACs tested diminished significantly the formation of the CEU022 h-tubulin byproduct (Fig. 1C), thus confirming that CEU-025,
CEU-027, and their corresponding oxazoline bioisosteres are not
reversible antagonists of the h-tubulin colchicine-binding site.
These observations suggest that N-hTAC does not inhibit cell
growth as hTAC or classic h-tubulin targeting agents such as
colchicinoids and taxoids. To confirm that hypothesis, we did growth
inhibition assays using CHO-10001 (wt) and mutant CHO-VV 3-2 and
CHO-TAX 5-6 cell lines, which exhibit differential sensitivity to anti–
h-tubulin agents through h-tubulin mutations (26, 27). CHO-VV 3-2
cells are resistant to molecules such as vinblastine and colchicinoids
and hypersensitive to taxoids such as paclitaxel. Conversely, CHOTAX 5-6 cells are resistant to paclitaxel and hypersensitive to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

vinblastine and colchicinoids. CHO-VV 3-2 and CHO-TAX 5-6 were
previously found to be resistant and hypersensitive, respectively, to
hTAC such as CEU-022 (8, 24) and as shown in this study (Fig. 1D). In
contrast, wt and h-tubulin–mutant cell lines displayed similar growth
inhibition sensitivities in response to CEU-025, CEU-027, OXA-152,
and OXA-195. These results suggest that N-hTAC agents inhibit
tumor cell growth through mechanisms unrelated to the microtubule
dynamic perturbations triggered by classic microtubule-targeting
agents such as colchicine and vinblastine and molecules belonging to
the hTAC subset.
BTAC and N-BTAC induce microtubule depolymerization. To
assess whether N-hTAC can lead to the microtubule network
depolymerization, h-tubulin immunofluorescence analysis was
done with confocal microscopy following treatment of HT1080
cells with N-hTAC. CEU-236 was used as a positive control to
induce microtubule depolymerization and was compared with
OXA-195. Unexpectedly, we found that OXA-195, similarly to
CEU-236, induced an early (2 h) massive depolymerization of
microtubule (Fig. 2A). This suggests that CEU or OXA-mediated
h-tubulin alkylation is not a prerequisite to induce microtubule
depolymerization. Figure 2B shows that other N-hTACs (e.g.,
CEU-025 and CEU-152) provoked also substantial microtubule
depolymerization whereas CEU-027 induced weak microtubule
depolymerization in HT1080 cells. Together, this supports that
hTAC and N-hTAC interfere with the polymerization process of
microtubule to different extents and mechanisms.
BTAC and N-BTAC induce apoptosis. We next investigated
whether hTAC and N-hTAC induce cell death through apoptosis.

New Cytotoxic Compounds against Chemoresistant Cells

We have shown that CEUs and oxazolines, regardless of their htubulin alkylating potency, induced PARP cleavage in MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, we have shown that DNA fragmentation
occurs following exposure to any of the CEU and oxazoline used in
the present study (data not shown). Kinetic analysis of caspase
activation in HT1080 cells shows that OXA-195 (50 Amol/L) triggers
PARP cleavage after 8 h (Fig. 3B) and the activation of initiators
caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that both the intrinsic
and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated in response to OXA195. As expected, the effector caspase-3 was activated subsequently
to the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 3B). Accordingly,
cytochrome c is released from mitochondria following exposure to
OXA-195 (Fig. 3C) and occurs simultaneously with the induction of
caspase-9 activation in response to OXA-195 (e.g., after 8 h; data not
shown). Moreover, we observed that other hTACs and N-hTACs
induced also the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9
and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in HT1080 and
MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Altogether, these observations indicate that CEU and oxazoline, regardless of their capacity
to alkylate h-tubulin, induce apoptosis in cancer cells.
BTAC and N-BTAC impair the mitochondrial respiratory
chain. ROS production and loss of DW m are common cell death

manifestations occurring during the early phases of apoptosis (28).
We assessed the loss of DW m and ROS production changes in
response to OXA-195 by flow cytometry using the cationic DiOC6
and hydroethidine probes, respectively. HT1080 exposed to OXA195 exhibited an increased percentage of the cell population
showing time-dependent DW m loss and increased ROS production,
both appearing as early as 2 h posttreatment (Fig. 3D). Other
hTACs and N-hTACs did also induce DW m loss (Supplementary
data). However, in the same conditions, these agents triggered
contrasting ROS production responses (Fig. 4A, q+ ). For example,
OXA-152 and OXA-195 induced substantial increase of ROS
production, whereas CEU-022 and CEU-025 triggered a decrease
of ROS production compared with DMSO (Fig. 4A, q+ ). We
hypothesized that the abilities of CEUs and oxazolines to modulate
ROS production originate from the impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC). To investigate that possibility, we
compared the ROS production induced by different CEUs and
oxazolines in wt HT1080 cells (U+) and HT1080 cells that are
depleted of mitochondrial DNA (U0). U0 cells do not express a
number of essential components of the MRC, hence abrogating the
production of ROS from MRC (29). Mitochondrial depletion was
confirmed by Western blot analysis of cytochrome oxidase subunit

CEUs, or oxazolines, carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP;
10 Amol/L) was added or not, as indicated,
for 1 h in the culture medium. Cells were
then harvested, washed, and stained with
hydroethidine to measure ROS production
level by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

Exposure to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 1.2

Figure 5. OXA-195 induces massive
swelling of rat liver mitochondria that is
cyclosporin A and Bcl-2 insensitive.
Kinetics of rat liver mitochondria swelling
was measured by absorbance at 540 nm
using 0.5 mg/mL rat liver mitochondria as
described in Materials and Methods.
Arrows, time at which the drugs were
added as depicted by the sharp
absorbance change due to the opening of
the spectrophotometer sample
compartment. As indicated, DMSO (0.25%
v/v) or CaCl2 (150 Amol/L) was added as
negative and positive control of swelling
induction, respectively. A, the CEU or
oxazoline derivatives (100 Amol/L) listed in
Table 1 were added. B to D, swelling
assays were done as described in (A ) in
the presence of different concentrations
(indicated in the text) of cyclosporin A
(CsA ) and/or bongkrekic acid (BA ; B ),
atractyloside (ATR ; C ), or recombinant
Bcl-2 (10 Ag/mL; D ) for 2 min before
exposure to OXA-195 (115 Amol/L) or
CaCl2 (150 Amol/L). Arrows on top (A–D )
indicate the time at which OXA-195 or
CaCl2 was added and left arrow (B–D)
marks the addition of other agents. All
swelling responses are representative of at
least three independent experiments.

II, a mitochondrial DNA–encoded protein (data not shown). Figure
4A shows that mitochondrial DNA depletion abrogated the
modulating action of CEU or oxazoline tested on the ROS
production level, thus supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, in
the presence of the respiration uncoupler carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone, an agent stimulating the electron flow of
MRC, all CEUs and oxazolines increased ROS production in U+ cells
but not in U0 cells (Fig. 4A). No significant loss of viability was
observed at all time periods of treatment used in these experiments
as revealed by the forward and side scatter analysis of flow
cytometry data (data not shown), thus excluding that the ROS and
DW m responses are resulting from extensive cell damage.
Altogether, these results suggest that CEU and oxazoline interfere
with the MRC early in cell death cascade induced by these
compounds.
Mitochondrial DNA depletion in HT1080 cells induces
opposite effects on the cytotoxic activities of BTAC versus
N-BTAC. Interestingly, U0 cells are relatively resistant to hTAC
(Fig. 4B ) and classic chemotherapeutic agents such as 5fluorouracil (5-FU), daunorubicin, chlorambucil, paclitaxel, and
vinblastine (Fig. 4C). In contrast, U0 cells show increase sensitivity
to N-hTAC (Fig. 4B). U0 cells are also much more sensitive to 2-deoxy+
D-glucose compared with U cells (Fig. 4C), thus illustrating the
glycolytic metabolic dependence of these cells.
OXA-195 induces massive swelling of mitochondria. Our
finding that hTAC and N-hTAC induce early MRC impairment led
us to hypothesize that these compounds may target the
mitochondrion to initiate apoptosis. We speculated that CEU and
oxazoline might be PTP opening agents. To investigate this, we
studied the capacity of CEU and oxazoline to induce swelling of
isolated rat liver mitochondria. Ca2+ mitochondrial overloading by
calcium chloride (CaCl2) exposure was used as a positive control

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

inducing mitochondrial swelling. In our assays, swelling of rat liver
mitochondria was optimal when using 150 Amol/L Ca2+ (Fig. 5A).
None of the CEUs and oxazolines (Table 1) assessed with a
relatively high concentration (100 Amol/L) induced swelling, except
for OXA-195 (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, OXA-195 induced
rapid swelling of mitochondria that caused larger amplitude
changes than Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). OXA-195–mediated mitochondrial
swelling was also observed on mitochondria of intact MDA-MB-231
cells, as confirmed by electron microscope analysis (Supplementary
data).
Classical PTP-regulating agents differentially affect the OXA195– and Ca2+-induced swelling. To understand the potential role
of PTP-associated proteins in the OXA-195–mediated swelling
effect, we have evaluated the effect of inhibitors known to interfere
with the function of these proteins. Cyclosporin A, a classic PTP
blocker that interferes with the function of cyclophilin D into PTP
opening (14), blocked the swelling induced by Ca2+ (Fig. 5B).
However, it had a weak inhibitory activity on the swelling induced
by OXA-195 (Fig. 5B). Bongkrekic acid is an antiapoptotic agent
inhibiting PTP opening and converting ANT into its ‘‘closed’’
m-conformation (i.e., exposing the adenine-binding site of
ANT toward the matrix; ref. 30). Bongkrekic acid pretreatment
(25 Amol/L) considerably inhibited the Ca2+-mediated swelling
effect (Fig. 5B). Bongkrekic acid could also inhibit OXA-195–
induced swelling but only with higher concentrations (50–100
Amol/L; Fig. 5B). Interestingly, cotreatment with cyclosporin A
(1 Amol/L) and bongkrekic acid (25 Amol/L) completely blocked the
swelling induced by Ca2+, but had no such additive effect on the
swelling induced by OXA-195 even at high concentrations (5 and 100
Amol/L, respectively; Fig. 5B), as compared with each agent used
separately at the same concentrations (data not shown). Atractyloside is also an ANT inhibitor but, in contrast to bongkrekic acid, is a

New Cytotoxic Compounds against Chemoresistant Cells

proapoptotic agent that opens PTP. Atractyloside induces the
c-conformation of ANT (i.e., exposing the adenine-binding site of
ANT toward the cytoplasm; ref. 30). In agreement with other reports
(31), we showed that atractyloside itself could induce the swelling of
rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 5C). In our assays, this effect was
observed at concentrations >2 mmol/L (Fig. 5C). To evaluate the
contribution of atractyloside on other swelling inducers, we used 1
mmol/L atractyloside, which per se induced little swelling (Fig. 5C).
Pretreatment of rat liver mitochondria with atractyloside slightly
enhanced the kinetics of Ca2+-mediated swelling (Fig. 5C).
Surprisingly, atractyloside pretreatment significantly inhibited
OXA-195–mediated rat liver mitochondria swelling (Fig. 5C).
Markedly, supplementation of rat liver mitochondria with recombinant Bcl-2 (10 Ag/mL) almost completely abrogated Ca2+mediated swelling (Fig. 5D). In contrast, a similar Bcl-2 addition
did not prevent the swelling induced by OXA-195. Altogether, these
results suggest that OXA-195 can induce mitochondrial swelling via
a nonclassic PTP-dependent mechanism.

PTP-regulating agents modulate CEU- and oxazoline-mediated growth inhibition responses. We next investigated the effect
of PTP inhibitors on the growth inhibition responses induced by
CEU or oxazoline. Unexpectedly, pretreatment of HT1080 cells with
the PTP blocker cyclosporin A increased the growth inhibition
responses induced by N-hTAC and hTAC (Supplementary data). In
contrast, pretreatment of cells with atractyloside substantially
reduced the antiproliferative action of N-hTAC but not of hTAC
(Supplementary data).
CEU and oxazoline bind covalently to the VDAC-1. Previous
experiments conducted by Legault et al. (8) suggested that CEU
and oxazoline derivatives can covalently bind to proteins that are
unrelated to h-tubulin to induce their growth inhibition and
proapoptotic actions. SDS-PAGE autoradiograms of cells treated
with [14C]CEU-022, [14C]CEU-025, or [14C]CEU-027 (Fig. 1B)
revealed the radiolabeling of several proteins, notably a 34-kDa
(p34) protein. The identification of p34 was done using isoelectric
focusing/two-dimensional electrophoresis of proteins extracted

equivalent to 2  105 cells were

transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were autoradiographed

protein (10 AL) extract was separated on
SDS-PAGE (17.5%) and transferred onto

was autoradiographed for detection of [14C]
signal. The same membrane was used
for VDAC-1 detection by Western blot
analysis with anti–VDAC-1. A and B,

and oxidized (Ox ) VDAC-1 have apparent
molecular weights of 34 and 30 kDa,
respectively.

from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with [14C]CEU-025. Figure 6A
shows the presence of the [14C]CEU-025 labeled p34 byproduct
exhibiting an estimated isoelectric point of f8. p34 was localized
by silver staining on a corresponding two-dimensional gel, excised
from the gel, trypsinized, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry.
It allowed the identification of the voltage-dependence anion
channel isoform-1 (VDAC-1) as the most likely target of CEU-025
(data not shown). Western blot analysis with anti–VDAC-1 revealed
a spot that perfectly matches the radioactive spot onto the
nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 6A), strongly suggesting that VDAC1 is a target of [14C]CEU-025. Similar results were observed for
protein extracts labeled with [14C]CEU-022 and [14C]CEU-027 (data
not shown). Furthermore, purified VDAC-1 isoform isolated from
MDA-MB-231 cells treated with [14C]CEU-025 also displayed
corresponding anti–VDAC-1 and radioactive signals (Fig. 6B).
CEU-025 alkylates cysteine residue(s) of VDAC-1. The human
VDAC-1 isoform possesses only two conserved cysteinyl residues
(Cys127 and Cys232) able to form a disulfide bridge via a redox
reaction, which is impaired by alkylating agents (32). We examined
the ability of CEU and oxazoline to block the diamide-mediated
disulfide bridge formation. Under nonreducing conditions, the
disulfide bridge of VDAC-1 (oxidized form) generated by the
addition of diamide exhibits an increased electrophoretic mobility
of VDAC-1 easily distinguishable from the fully reduced form, as
described by De Pinto et al. (32) and shown in Fig. 6C. The
monothiol alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide abolished the
migration shift of VDAC-1 induced by diamide (data not shown).
Figure 6D shows that increasing the time of exposure of MDA-MB231 cells to CEU-025 leads to a progressive formation of the
reduced band of VDAC-1 in the presence of diamide. Similar results
were obtained in response to CEU-O22 and CEU-027 (data not
shown). These results strongly suggest that CEU-022, CEU-025, and
CEU-027 alkylate VDAC-1 on at least one of the two cysteinyl
residues.

Discussion
The main objective of this work was to investigate the
mechanism underlying the cytotoxic and growth inhibition
properties of hTAC and a newly discovered subset of CEUs and
oxazolines called N-hTAC. Regardless of their potency to bind to htubulin, we found that CEU and oxazoline induced apoptosis in
cancer cells. The activation of initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9 in
response to OXA-195 supports the view that the intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathways can be activated by hTAC and NhTAC.
An important finding is that the cytotoxicity of N-hTAC was
increased in U0 cells when compared with U+ cells. Depletion of
mitochondrial DNA reportedly increases the resistance of cancer
cells toward chemotherapeutic drugs (33). Accordingly, we
observed that HT1080 U0 cells are less sensitive than U+ cells to
various antineoplastic agents, such as microtubule-targeting agents
paclitaxel and vinblastine. The mechanisms responsible for such
resistance are not fully understood. Mitochondrial DNA depletion
may be involved in the etiology of cancer, notably by increasing the
expression of genes that enhance glycolysis, block apoptosis, and
increase the invasive behavior of cancer cells (34). These genetic
changes might be essential for the survival of cancer cell clusters in
tumor hypoxic environments. Accordingly, U0 cells are much more
sensitive than U+ cells to the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose.
Glycolytic inhibitors constitute a new chemotherapeutic strategy to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

target hypoxia-resistant tumor cells. Although we do not know yet
whether and how N-hTAC affects glycolysis, our study suggests that
these agents should be tested for their capacity to selectively target
hypoxic chemoresistant tumor cells.
Based on time course experiments, both hTAC and N-hTAC
were found to induce early mitochondrial perturbations such as
collapse of DW m and MRC-dependent ROS production, their onset
(2 h) preceding the apparent release of cytochrome c (8 h, data not
shown). The roles of DW m loss and ROS production in apoptosis
have been the subject of controversies, but both were suggested to
be initial events inducing membrane permeability transition and
cytochrome c release (28). Our observations suggest that hTAC and
N-hTAC stimulate ROS production through impairment of the
MRC, but the contribution of those mitochondrial perturbations to
the cytotoxic mechanism and the targets of these compounds
remain to be determined. Mitochondrial ROS stimulation by
prooxidants was shown to induce PTP via an ANT dimerization–
dependent process (35). Increased ROS production can induce lipid
peroxidation and loss of mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, enabling
cytochrome c detachment from cardiolipin (36) and altering
membrane fluidity (37). Those alterations may in turn uncouple
MRC and further enhance ROS production. In this context, it is
noteworthy that some CEUs were found to interact with lipids and
alter membrane fluidity (38, 39).
OXA-195 was found to trigger a rapid swelling of rat liver
mitochondria, in contrast to other CEUs and oxazolines tested,
involving an atypical mechanism, which is notably insensitive to or
poorly affected by the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A and Bcl-2
supplementation. Intriguingly, the PTP opening agent atractyloside
diminished the extent of the rat liver mitochondria swelling and
the growth inhibition induced by some N-hTAC. In contrast,
cyclosporin A enhanced the growth inhibition induce by hTAC and
N-hTAC. It is unclear how CEU and oxazoline induce these
pharmacologically dependent responses. Yet, it further emphasizes
that hTAC and N-hTAC induce different cytotoxic mechanisms and
suggests that some of these compounds, such as OXA-195, induce
an unusual PTP-dependent apoptosis process. Accordingly, we
found that OXA-195 triggers cytochrome c release from isolated rat
liver mitochondria (data not shown). However, mitochondrial
swelling might not be essential to initiate membrane permeability
transition in response to CEU or oxazoline because CEU-025, which
does not induce swelling, induced cytochrome c release (data not
shown). Mitochondrial swelling before rupture of outer mitochondrial membrane is not a prerequisite for cytochrome c release (31).
We found that VDAC-1 is a potential target of N-hTAC (CEU-025
and CEU-027). VDAC-1 is a channel-forming protein present in the
outer mitochondrial membrane, which allows the exchange of
most metabolites, notably ADP/ATP between the cytosol and the
internal compartments of the mitochondrion (40). VDAC-1 was
proposed to be an intrinsic PTP component that by itself, or in
concert with other proteins such as ANT and proteins of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family, constitutes a channel allowing the
passage of cytochrome c (13). In that context, the conductance
properties of VDAC-1 were shown to be important whereas closed
conductance states of VDAC-1 stimulate membrane permeability
transition. Bcl-2 protein members modulate the conductance state
of VDAC-1 and thus control the onset of membrane permeability
transition (41). Interestingly, cytochrome c release, induced by ROS,
was found to be VDAC-1 dependent and cyclosporin A independent (42). The binding of hexokinase-1 or hexokinase-2 to
mitochondria was shown to involve interactions with VDAC-1

New Cytotoxic Compounds against Chemoresistant Cells

(17, 43). Interestingly, these interactions increase the glycolysisdependent metabolism of cancer cells and prevent the induction of
the apoptosis induced by different apoptotic stimuli such as
staurosporine (44–47). In the near future, it will be important to
assess whether N-hTAC–dependent VDAC-1 alkylation affects such
interactions with hexokinase-1 and/or hexokinase-2 to selectively
kill these hypoxia-resistant cells. It should be pointed out that the
apparent ability of hTAC compound (CEU-022) to bind to VDAC-1
raises issues in this context. Nevertheless, the ability of radiolabeled
hTAC and N-hTAC to alkylate various proteins suggests that the
cell growth inhibition mechanisms triggered by these compounds
are complex and do not rely per se on the selective and specific
alkylation of a single protein. In addition, the alkylation of a protein
or a subset of proteins may modulate or be modulated by the
alkylation of other proteins. For example, the covalent binding of
hTAC to h-tubulin could modify the responses of VDAC-1
alkylation and vice versa. Thus, despite their inability to bind to
h-tubulin, N-hTAC could destabilize the microtubule network
through such alkylation interplays. In this context, it is known that
mitochondria are dynamically associated with microtubule and
that VDAC-1 is a binding site for h-tubulin (48). VDAC-1 was
recently reported to be required for Bim-dependent apoptosis (49),
a Bcl-2 proapoptotic member released from microtubule on
exposure to some cell death stimuli (50).

In conclusion, we have identified a new class of soft alkylating
agents, called N-hTACs, which induce apoptosis and microtubule
depolymerization of cancer cells. In contrast to hTAC, N-hTAC
does not covalently bind to h-tubulin and shows an increased
cytotoxicity against cells exhibiting mitochondrial DNA depletion,
which leads to resistance toward other chemotherapeutics. NhTAC molecules are promising tools for the design of new
antineoplastic agents that target chemoresistant or hypoxiaresistant cancer cells. These molecules may contribute to an
understanding of the signaling pathways underlying such resistance mechanisms. ANT and VDAC-1 might be key players in
controlling PTP-dependent apoptosis, microtubule-mitochondrion
interactions, and energetic balance either as protein binding
partners or an independent tandem with specific roles.
