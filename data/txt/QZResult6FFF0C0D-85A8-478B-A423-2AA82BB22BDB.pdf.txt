BACKGROUND: Antiangiogenic therapy has become the most important treatment modality for patients with
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors investigated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as
a potential biomarker for treatment efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who
had been enrolled in 3 prospective phase 2 clinical trials that evaluated either sorafenib, bevacizumab, or thalidomide
in combination with a potentially antiangiogenic, metronomic, oral 5-fluoropyrimidine as first-line systemic therapy
were included. An early AFP response was defined as a decline >20% from baseline after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment.
AFP response was analyzed for its association with treatment efficacy and survival outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-two
patients were included for early AFP response evaluation, and 12 of those patients (17%) were classified as early AFP
responders. Early AFP responders, compared with nonresponders, had a significantly improved overall response rate
(33% vs 8%; P ¼.037) and a significantly improved disease control rate (83% vs 35%; P ¼.002), which was defined as the
percentage of patients who had an objective response plus stable disease for a minimum of 8 weeks. AFP responders,
compared with nonresponders, also had longer median progression-free survival (PFS) (7.5 months vs 1.9 months;
P ¼.001) and longer median overall survival (OS) (15.3 months vs 4.1 months; P ¼.019). In a multivariate analysis, AFP
response remained a significant independent predictor of better PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that an early AFP response is a useful surrogate marker to predict treatment response and prognosis

The treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not amenable to curative or locoregional therapies
remains a great challenge in clinical practice. In general, cytotoxic chemotherapy is ineffective in the treatment of advanced
HCC.1-4 In the Asia-Pacific region, the median overall survival (OS) o patients with advanced HCC patients ranges from
2 months to 4 months with supportive care.5-7
Sorafenib is a multitargeted agent that has antiangiogenic activity.8 In 2 phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, sorafenib significantly improved the time-to-tumor progression (TTP) and OS in patients with advanced HCC.6,9
Several other antiangiogenic agents, such as sunitinib, bevacizumab, thalidomide, brivanib, and ABT-869, also have demonstrated variable clinical activities in advanced HCC.10-15 However, antitumor activities of antiangiogenic agents remain
modest, and the objective tumor response rates produced range from 3% to 13% assessed by conventional response criteria.6,9-15 Therefore, it is imperative to search for biomarkers for antiangiogenic agents in HCC.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein that is expressed by HCC and is secreted into the serum of approximately
70% of patients with HCC. AFP levels have been widely monitored in the management of HCC and provide 1 criterion

among the HCC diagnostic criteria in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines.16 Previous studies have demonstrated that the baseline AFP level
is a significant prognostic factor for various stages of
HCC.16-22 Recently, Chan and colleagues reported that a
decline in the post-treatment AFP level was associated
with radiologic tumor response and survival in patients
with advanced HCC who received doxorubicin-based
combination chemotherapy.23 Vora et al. also reported
that post-treatment AFP changes were closely associated
with clinical outcomes in patients who received various
types of systemic therapy.24 Whether changes in AFP can
predict the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced
HCC who receive antiangiogenic therapies remains
unclear. In the current study, we analyzed patients with
advanced HCC who had been received antiangiogenic
agents in 3 prospective phase 2 trials, and we retrospectively studied the association of AFP response with tumor
response and survival outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of patients with HCC
who were enrolled prospectively in 3 phase 2 studies of

Cancer

October 1, 2010

first-line systemic therapy for advanced diseases at
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), Taipei,
Taiwan, between 2005 and 2008.25-27 To be enrolled in
these phase 2 studies, these patients needed to have metastatic or locally advanced HCC that was not amenable to
locoregional therapies, including surgery, transcatheter arterial (chemo)embolization, and local ablation.
The 3 phase 2 trials tested the hypothesis that the
antitumor effect of antiangiogenic therapy in patients
with advanced HCC could be enhanced by metronomic
chemotherapy, which was defined as the uninterrupted
administration of chemotherapeutic agents at lower doses
for a prolonged time.28 In preclinical models, metronomic chemotherapy reportedly was antiangiogenic
rather than cancer cell cytotoxic.29-32 The detailed treatment regimens and eligibility criteria of the 3 trials are
provided in Table 1. Therapy continued until tumor progression or until intolerable toxicities occurred.
The main eligibility criteria of the 3 trials were similar. For example, patients had to provide written informed
consent; and they had to have at least 1 measurable lesion
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria (version 1.0),33 adequate liver reserve
(Child-Pugh Class A), and adequate major organ functions. The other key eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.

Original Article

Patients had imaging studies obtained for tumor
response evaluation every 6 to 8 weeks. The efficacy endpoints of the studies included objective tumor response
according to RECIST criteria; the disease control rate,
which was defined as the percentage of patients who had
an objective tumor response or disease stabilization for a
minimum of 8 weeks; progression-free survival (PFS);
and OS.
The 3 phase 2 clinical studies had been approved by
the Institute Research Ethical Committee of NTUH. The
recruitment notification has been posted online (available
at: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov accessed on December
22, 2009).
Examination of AFP Level and Definition
of Early AFP Response
According to the protocol designs, serum AFP levels were
measured at baseline and every 2 or 3 weeks after the start
of treatment until patients developed tumor progression
or discontinued treatment. Serum AFP levels were measured by using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay
(Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Ill) during the prospective
trials by the Central Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry
in the Department of Laboratory Medicine at NTUH.
Patients who had normal baseline AFP levels
(<20 ng/mL) were excluded in the AFP response evaluation because, they are less likely to have a significant
decline in AFP level. Early AFP response was defined as a
decline >20% from the baseline AFP level within the first
4 weeks of initiating treatment.23 If more than 1 AFP level
was available during the first 4 weeks after treatment, then
the higher level was chosen.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC). In statistical testing, 2-sided P values .05
were considered statistically significant. The associations
between treatment response or disease control with AFP
response were examined by chi-square tests or Fisher exact
tests.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Early AFP response, along with other clinicopathologic variables, was evaluated first in univariate analyses
and then in multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model to determine potential associations
with survival outcome in patients with HCC. The clinicopathologic variables included treatment cohort, age, sex,
performance status, hepatitis etiology, vascular invasion,

4592

extrahepatic involvement, metastatic sites, Cancer of the
Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score,34 Okuda stage, and
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. In the stepwise variable selection procedure during multivariate analysis, all significant and nonsignificant covariates were
considered, and the significance levels for entry and for
stay were set at 0.15.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The 3 phase 2 trials enrolled a total of 141 patients, and
107 of those patients were from NTUH. Eighty-five
patients (79%) had elevated baseline AFP levels. Patients
who had no post-treatment AFP evaluation because of
rapid disease progression (11 patients) or missing followup AFP data (2 patients) were excluded; thus, 72 patients
were analyzed for early AFP response.
Among the 72 patients, 90% were men, the median
age was 54 years (range, 24-83 years), 78% were seropositive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), 97%
had either extrahepatic metastasis (64%) or macrovascular
invasion (61%), and 99% were classified with BCLC stage
C disease. Their demographic features are summarized in
Table 2. With regard to treatment response, there were 0
complete responses and 9 partial responses, for an overall
tumor response rate of 13%. The median PFS was 2
months, and the OS was 4.8 months for all 72. Survival
outcomes did not differ significantly between patients
who received different regimens (log-rank test: PFS,
P ¼ .200; OS, P ¼ .186).
Early AFP Response and Treatment
Outcomes
Twelve of the 72 patients (17%) were classified as early
AFP responders. Compared with nonresponders, early
AFP responders had a significantly higher objective
response rate (ORR) (33% vs 8%; P ¼ .037) and disease
control rate (83% vs 35%; P ¼ .002) (Table 3).
Early AFP response was a favorable predictor of PFS
and OS. Early AFP responders, compared with nonresponders, had a significantly longer median PFS (7.5
months vs 1.9 months; P ¼ .001) (Fig. 1, top) and median
OS (15.3 months vs 4.1 months; P ¼ .019) (Fig. 1,
bottom).

and other clinical parameters (Table 4). An early AFP
response (hazard ratio [HR], 0.307; P ¼ .003) was an independent factor associated with longer PFS. Other independent factors that had a significant impact on PFS
included being a man, positive serum HBsAg status, poorer
performance status, and higher CLIP score, and every variable was associated significantly with shorter PFS. When
we analyzed for the impact on OS, an early AFP response

(HR, 0.356; P ¼ .017) and a lower CLIP score were significant independent factors associated with longer OS.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that an early AFP
response, ie, a decline >20% from the baseline AFP level
within the first month after the initiation of treatment,
was associated significantly with better efficacy endpoints
of antiangiogenic therapies in patients with advanced
HCC. The early AFP responders in this study had a significantly better treatment response, better disease control,
longer PFS, and longer OS compared with AFP nonresponders. It is noteworthy that the AFP nonresponders
had a disappointingly low disease control rate (35%) and
extremely poor median PFS and OS (1.9 months and 4.1
months, respectively).
Unlike the baseline AFP level, the prognostic value
of which has been explored extensively in various stages of
HCC, AFP changes during treatment have been evaluated
less frequently for their predictive or prognostic significance. Three recent studies in patients with advanced
HCC who received various types of systemic therapy,
such as thalidomide,35 doxorubicin-based combination
chemotherapy,23 and chemotherapy with or without
molecularly targeted therapies,24 concluded that an AFP
change during treatment is a useful surrogate for predicting tumor response and patient survival, a finding that
was supported by the current report focusing on antiangiogenic therapy as the treatment strategy.
However, previous studies have not agreed on the
definition of AFP response with regard to the magnitude
of AFP decline and the time points for evaluating AFP levels.23,24,35 The AFP decline is either a 50% reduction24,35
or a 20% reduction from baseline23; and the post-treatment time points were 4 weeks to 8 weeks, 7 weeks to 9
weeks, or different time points throughout the course of
treatment.23,24,35 The early AFP response that we used in
the current study was based on AFP changes within the
first month after the initiation of treatment. To our
knowledge, this is the earliest time point ever used in similar studies, but it appears to be the most relevant for the
clinical practice of treating patients with advanced HCC.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the median PFS and OS of
patients with advanced HCC can be as short as 2 months
to 4 months.5-7 A biomarker that can be detected in the
early phase of treatment is valuable, because it may help
identify a subgroup of patients who have a poor prognosis
and are candidates for novel or other treatment strategies.

We adopted a 20% decline from the baseline AFP
level as an AFP response, because the criterion of a 50%
reduction at such an early time point may be so stringent
that it can exclude a substantial portion of patients who
may obtain a clinical benefit without having a rapid and
dramatic tumor response. Indeed, when we performed the

4594

analysis using a 50% reduction from baseline as an AFP
response, much fewer patients (only 4) were classified as
responders. Despite this limitation, the responders under
such a stringent definition still had highly favorable efficacy endpoints. Whether a greater AFP decline confers
better therapeutic efficacy is an interesting hypothesis that
is worth testing. However, we did not observe such an
association in the current study. For example, patients
who had a 50% reduction in AFP level, compared with
patients who had a 20% to 50% reduction, did not have a
higher ORR, disease control rate (Fisher exact test;
P ¼ .222 and P ¼ .470, respectively) or longer median
PFS and OS (log-rank test; P ¼ .800 and P ¼ .487,
respectively).
A negative predictor of poor response or no response
to antiangiogenic therapy may be as important as a positive prognostic or predictive marker. A recent example of
K-ras mutation in patients with advanced colorectal cancer as a negative predictor for the efficacy of cetuximab, a
monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth
factor receptor, demonstrated how a negative predictor
may help to tailor better, personalized cancer therapy.36
In terms of our current results, it was reasonable to suspect

Cancer

October 1, 2010

AFP Response and HCC Treatment Efficacy/Shao et al

that patients who had a rise in AFP level after treatment
would have poorer treatment response and survival outcomes. However, the association of poor treatment outcomes, including nonresponse or independently worse
predictors for PFS and OS, with ‘‘early AFP progression,’’
ie, elevated AFP levels within the first month after treatment, could not be identified in our cohort (data not
shown). Future studies in larger patient cohorts and/or
with more stringent criteria for ‘‘early AFP progression’’
may be helpful to verify the usefulness of such an
approach.
Biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy have been investigated actively, and the
potential surrogate markers include circulating angiogenesis-related factors like vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), functional imaging studies like dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image (DCE-MRI),
and the enumeration of circulating endothelial cells
(CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors cells
(CEPs).37 Serum or plasma levels of VEGF or other
angiogenic factors that can be determined readily with
established procedures have not been effective predictors
in patients with advanced HCC who receive antiangiogenic-targeted agents.11,15 DCE-MRI and the enumeration of CECs/CEPs, which are scientifically sound, are
not readily applicable, because the standard protocols for
these approaches remain undetermined, and the required
instruments and procedures are restricted mainly to academic research centers. In contrast, the measurement of
serum AFP has been a routine clinical biochemistry test
for decades, and AFP monitoring can be implemented immediately, easily, and broadly in the clinic as a potential
surrogate for the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in
patients with advanced HCC.
Potential limitations of our study included a relatively small patient number and a less homogenous
patient population, which consisted of 3 phase 2 study
cohorts. However, the 3 different combination therapies
were based on the same rationale and similar designs, ie,
the combination of an agent with antiangiogenic activity,
such as sorafenib, and metronomic chemotherapy using
an oral fluoropyrimidine. Furthermore, we evaluated
treatment cohort as a variable in the multivariate analysis
and observed no interactions between treatment cohort
and the predictive value of AFP level.
In conclusion, our current results indicate that an
early AFP response is a significant predictor of efficacy
and survival outcomes for patients with advanced HCC
who receive antiangiogenic therapies. The evaluation of

Cancer

AFP levels, especially in the early phase of treatment, warrants further exploration in future clinical studies.
