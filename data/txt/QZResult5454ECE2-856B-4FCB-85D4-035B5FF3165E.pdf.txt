Abstract
Although trastuzumab (Herceptin) has substantially improved
the overall survival of patients with mammary carcinomas,
even initially well-responding tumors often become resistant.
Because natural killer (NK) cell–mediated antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is thought to contribute to
the therapeutic effects of trastuzumab, we have established a
cell culture system to select for ADCC-resistant SK-OV-3
ovarian cancer and MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells. Ovarian
cancer cells down-regulated HER2 expression, resulting in a
more resistant phenotype. MCF7 breast cancer cells, however,
failed to develop resistance in vitro. Instead, treatment with
trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells resulted in the preferential survival of individual sphere-forming cells that displayed
a CD44highCD24low ‘‘cancer stem cell–like’’ phenotype and
expressed significantly less HER2 compared with non–stem
cells. Likewise, the CD44highCD24low population was also
found to be more immunoresistant in SK-BR3, MDA-MB231,
and BT474 breast cancer cell lines. When immunoselected
MCF7 cells were then re-expanded, they mostly lost the
observed phenotype to regenerate a tumor cell culture that
displayed the initial HER2 surface expression and ADCCsusceptibility, but was enriched in CD44highCD24low cancer
stem cells. This translated into increased clonogenicity
in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Thus, we provide evidence
that the induction of ADCC by trastuzumab and NK cells may
spare the actual tumor-initiating cells, which could explain
clinical relapse and progress. Moreover, our observation that
the ‘‘relapsed’’ in vitro cultures show practically identical HER2
surface expression and susceptibility toward ADCC suggests
that the administration of trastuzumab beyond relapse might
be considered, especially when combined with an immunestimulatory treatment that targets the escape variants. [Cancer

Introduction
The Her-2/neu (c-erbB2, HER2) proto-oncogene belongs to a
family of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that

sion of the HER2 protein, amplification of the her-2/neu gene, or
both occurs in 20% to 25% of breast cancers (2, 3), 7 to 13% of
newly diagnosed ovarian cancers (3, 4), and in the majority of
ovarian cancer cells removed at a second surgery or isolated from
ascites of stage III or IV ovarian cancer patients (5).
Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech), a humanized monoclonal
antibody (rhumAb 4D5) directed against the extracellular domain
of HER2, improves disease-free and overall survival in patients with
early, metastasized, or recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer
significantly (6, 7). Clinically, its most important adverse effect is
cardiotoxicity, which is reported in 2.6% to 4.5% of patients (8). The
far greater problem is that a significant number of patients with
HER2-overexpressing tumors do not respond to trastuzumab (6) or
eventually develop resistance after a good initial response (9).
For ovarian cancer treatment, however, trastuzumab does not
play a significant role because HER2 overexpression is rare and the
objective response rates (7.3%) are low among HER2-overexpressing
ovarian cancer patients (10). Data regarding the combination of
trastuzumab with chemotherapy are scarce for these patients.
Being an antibody, trastuzumab does not only block HER2
signaling—which could equally be achieved by small-molecule
inhibitors (11). Instead, trastuzumab also recruits cytotoxic effector
cells via the Fcg-part of this IgG1 antibody (12, 13) and thus
induces the so-called ‘‘antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity’’ (ADCC), which can be effected by granulocytes, monocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (14). NK
cells that express the activating FcgRIIIA, but no inhibitory Fcg
receptors, are widely believed to be the major mediators of ADCC.
Accordingly, surgical breast specimens from trastuzumab-treated
patients revealed increased numbers of tumor-associated NK cells
that expressed higher levels of Granzyme B and TiA1 (15, 16).
Likewise, ADCC and overall NK cell activity were found to correlate
with responses to trastuzumab (17). In experimental animal
models, trastuzumab reduced the tumor volume by 96% in NK
cell competent nude mice, but by <30% in the corresponding
FcgRIIIA knockout animals (18). In vitro experiments further
showed that trastuzumab-induced ADCC against various tumor
cell targets depends on the Fc-part of the antibody (19), the
availability of FcgRIIIA or CD16 on NK cells (20), and the presence
of interleukin 2 (IL-2; ref. 21)—all arguing for a significant
contribution from NK cells. Nevertheless, the important quest for
mechanisms mediating trastuzumab resistance has largely concentrated on strategies that enable the cancer cells to overcome the
growth-inhibitory signals of HER2-blockade.
Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been described in both ovarian and
mammary cancers, and may be responsible for resistance against

Escape of HER2 low Breast Cancer Stem Cells from ADCC

therapeutic modalities. Although HER2 is not expressed in normal
mouse mammary stem cells (22), its overexpression was found to
drive mammary carcinogenesis (23) by converting normal mammary stem or progenitor cells into CSC, i.e., cells that show the
ability to initiate and sustain tumor formation, growth, and
resistance to chemotherapy. Within breast cancers, these CSC
constitute a small subset characterized by a CD44highCD24low
phenotype and by stem cell properties such as unlimited selfrenewal, differentiation potential, and tumorsphere-like growth
(24). In addition, tumor fractionation and subsequent inoculation
of nude mice with limiting cell numbers (f100 cells) has shown
that only these cells can initiate tumors in vivo (25). Clinically, a
correlation between the expression of HER2 and stem cell markers
has also been verified (26). For ovarian cancer, in contrast, both the
phenotype of putative tumor-initiating cells as well as a potential
link to HER2 expression are still unclear (27).
In line with the effect of HER2 on mammary stem cells, HER2positive breast cancer displays an aggressive phenotype with a high
rate of recurrence and short disease-free intervals after adjuvant
(postoperative) chemotherapy (2). In ovarian cancer, in contrast, no
significant correlation was found between HER2 expression and the
generally poor survival (28).
Considering that the ‘‘three Es of cancer immunoediting,’’ i.e.,
elimination, equilibrium, and escape (29) are likely to occur during
treatment with trastuzumab as well as during other immune
therapies, we have tested whether treatment with trastuzumab and
polyclonal NK cells would select for immune-resistant subclones of
HER2-expressing SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer and MCF7 breast cancer
cells. This has led to the identification of two different strategies by
which cancer cells can acquire resistance against trastuzumab:
SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells down-regulate HER2 expression,
which results in a more resistant phenotype. MCF7 and other
breast cancer cell lines, in contrast, contain a highly tumorigenic
CSC fraction that displays a reduced HER2 expression and is
consequently less susceptible toward ADCC. Moreover, when this
fraction survives an immunoselection process, it can regenerate a
culture that strikingly resembles the one observed before
treatment, but is even more tumorigenic.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer and MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT-474,
and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and cultured as indicated by the supplier. Stable firefly
luciferase-expressing transfectants were generated from the parental cell
lines by lipofection with FuGene HD (Roche) and subsequent selection with
G418 (Carl Roth). The fLuc-neo/zeo plasmid was generously provided by
Dr. Michael Jensen (City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA). To
investigate clonogenicity, 100 or 500 cells, respectively, were seeded in 24well plates and the resulting mammospheres were counted after 18 d under
an inverted microscope (Leica).
Flow cytometric analysis of surface expression levels and cell
sorting. Cells (106 per sample) were detached with Accutase (PAA), blocked
with 250 Ag/mL human control IgG1 (Beriglobin), and stained with 10 Ag/mL
trastuzumab (Roche) followed by a Cy5-conjugated anti-human IgG
(Rockland Immunochemicals) detection antibody. Simultaneously, CD44RPE (Clone F10-44-2, AbD Serotec), CD24-FITC (clone SN3, Immunotools),
and the life stain 7-aminoactinomycin D (Sigma) were applied and analyzed
on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Where appropriate,
expression levels are indicated as specific fluorescence intensity values,
which are obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity detected with the
specific antibody by the signal measured with the isotype-matched control
antibody. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting, the stained

www.aacrjournals.org

cells were separated twice on a Digital FACSVantage (BD Biosciences), first
in yield, then in purity mode.
NK cell preparation and cytotoxicity assays. Peripheral blood
lymphocytes were obtained from healthy volunteers by density gradient
centrifugation (Biocoll, Biochrom) and cultured for 8 to 11 d on irradiated
(30 Gy) RPMI 8866 feeder cells to obtain polyclonal NK cell populations (30).
CD3, CD56, and CD16 expression were analyzed by flow cytometry, and NK
cell purity was found to be >75%. Alternatively, NK cells were purified using
the NK cell isolation kit and expanded with the NK cell expansion and
activation kit (both from Miltenyi Biotec) or activated by addition of
100 U/mL IL-2 (Peprotech) for 48 h. This yielded NK cell cultures with
purities of >90%.
NK cell cytotoxicity against SK-OV-3 and early-passage MCF7 tumor cells
was assessed using luciferase-transfected targets seeded into 96-well plates
(104 per well). NK cells and trastuzumab or irrelevant human control IgG
were added in triplicates at the indicated effector/target ratios. After
addition of 0.14 mg/mL cell-permeable D-luciferin (PJK), luminescence
activity (which is proportional to cell viability) was recorded at different
time points using an Orion II luminometer (Berthold; ref. 31).
NK cell lysis of control or immune-selected MCF7 cells (which had lost
luciferase expression) was analyzed by modified FATAL assays (32). NK cells
were thus labeled with PKH-26 (Sigma), target cells (105 per well) were
stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen),
cocultures were set up using different effector/target ratios, and lytic
activity was assessed after 8 h by flow cytometric detection of
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl esterdim cells among the PKH26–negative target cell population. Values were corrected for spontaneous
leakage of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester.
Immunoselection of ADCC-resistant tumor cells using trastuzumab
and polyclonal NK cells. To select for ADCC-resistant tumor cell
subclones, 3  106 SK-OV-3 fLuc or MCF7 fLuc cancer cells were incubated
for 12 h with 50 ng/mL trastuzumab and 1.5  107 polyclonal human NK
cells that had been prepared as described above (30). Then, NK cells were
removed by washing, and the surviving cells were re-expanded in G418containing medium. In total, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells were subjected to
eight selection cycles and MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells to six selection
cycles of about 1 month each.
qRT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared using TriFast (Peqlab) and
transcribed with the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). For real-time
PCR, cDNA amplification was monitored using the ABsolute QPCR SYBR
Green Low Rox mix (ABgene) on the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The specific primers used were as follows:
18S up, 5¶-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3¶; 18S down, 5¶-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3¶; HER2 up, 5¶-TGGAAGCCACAAGGTAAACA-3¶; HER2
down, 5¶-CCTACTCCATCCCAAGCC TAT-3¶. Data analysis was done using
the DDCT method for relative quantification. Dissociation curves confirmed
the presence of a single specific PCR product.
Microscopy. Cells were immunoselected as described above and then
analyzed in vivo by phase contrast light microscopy using an Olympus IX-70
inverted system microscope at 48 h or 10 d after the NK cell/trastuzumab
challenge.
In vivo tumorigenicity assay. Immunoselected (103 or 104; n = 6 for
each cell number) or naı̈ve (n = 5) MCF7 breast cancer cells were suspended
in 50 AL PBS, mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and
injected into the mammary fat pad of NOD/Scid-mice (Charles River). The
animals were observed at least thrice per week and tumor formation was
recorded. On day 58, all tumors were removed, fixed in paraformaldehyde,
and embedded in paraffin. Ten-micrometer sections were stained with H&E
and the maximum tumor area was determined using a caliper. HER2
stainings were performed in routine diagnostics. All procedures were
conducted in accordance with German laws governing animal care.
Statistics. Experiments were performed at least thrice with similar
results and representative experiments are shown. In Figs. 1A and B, and
2A and B, analysis of significance was performed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s posttest for multiple comparisons (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01
for rhumAb 4D5 versus control IgG). Tumor-free survival was compared by
logrank test, tumor sizes, and clonogenicity by unpaired Student’s t test. All

Results
Trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells show synergistic
killing of naı̈ve SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer targets. To assess the
effect of trastuzumab on the NK cell–mediated lysis of HER2expressing ovarian cancer cells, luciferase-transfected SK-OV-3 cells
were treated with polyclonal NK cells in the presence of human
control IgG and/or trastuzumab at the indicated concentration.
Target cell lysis was determined at 4, 8, and 24 hours via the

ensuing decrease in ATP-dependent luciferase activity. This
showed that trastuzumab enhances the NK cell–mediated killing
of HER2-positive tumor targets, thus confirming previous reports
of trastuzumab-dependent, NK cell–mediated ADCC (Fig. 1A;
ref. 20). The time course of these experiments suggested a rapid
effect that cannot be due to growth inhibition. Moreover, the
required antibody concentrations were in a range that has been
found effective to induce ADCC (33), whereas considerably higher
trastuzumab concentrations seem to be required to block
proliferation of tumor cell targets (34). Accordingly, trastuzumab
showed only minor effects in this assay when applied alone.

Escape of HER2 low Breast Cancer Stem Cells from ADCC

Immune-selected SK-OV-3 cells show greatly decreased
ADCC and reduced HER2 surface expression. When SK-OV-3
ovarian cancer cells were repeatedly selected for survival in the
presence of trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells, a subline was
obtained that was still sensitive to NK cell–mediated killing.
However, addition of trastuzumab did not significantly increase
target cell lysis any more (except for the highest antibody
concentration at the highest effector/target ratio; Fig. 1B). This
loss of susceptibility toward trastuzumab and NK cell–mediated
ADCC may at least partly be explained by a down-regulation of
HER2 mRNA and surface expression (Fig. 1C).

Trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells show synergistic
killing of naı̈ve and immune-selected MCF7 mammary
carcinoma cells. Just like SK-OV-3 cells, HER2-expressing MCF7
mammary tumor cells showed increased susceptibility toward
NK cell–mediated killing in the presence of trastuzumab (Fig. 2A).
However, MCF7 cells that were selected for survival in the
presence of trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells lost luciferase
expression. Thus, cytotoxicity was now assessed by modified
FATAL assays as described by Krockenberger and colleagues (35).
Apart from this unexpected loss of bioluminescence, however,
no significant morphologic differences were observed between

breast cancer cells were challenged with rhumAb

the immunoselected and the initial cultures: The level of
antibody-dependent and antibody-independent target cell killing
remained identical over six consecutive selection rounds (data
not shown; Fig. 2B). Also HER2 mRNA and surface expression
were unaltered in the bulk population (data not shown; Fig. 2C).
Thus, we could not select ADCC-resistant subclones of the initial
MCF7 culture.
MCF7 cells surviving an ADCC challenge with NK cells and
trastuzumab show a ‘‘CSC-like’’ phenotype. Although we did not
obtain an immune-refractory MCF7 subline, we observed that the
cells surviving the challenge initially grew as spheres (Fig. 3A, top

right). After a phase of three-dimensional growth (Fig. 3A, bottom
right), further expansion and subculturing yielded a tumor cell
culture that recapitulated the initial morphology and growth
characteristics. Considering that MCF7 cells form rather heterogeneous cultures (36) and that the capability to reconstitute
heterogeneous tumor cell cultures has been ascribed to the socalled ‘‘CSCs,’’ we now wondered whether this particular subset
(24, 37–39) might have survived the coculture with trastuzumab
and NK cells.
In MCF7 and other breast cancer cell lines, CSC were described
as CD44highCD24low cells that can grow as ‘‘mammospheres’’ (40).

Escape of HER2 low Breast Cancer Stem Cells from ADCC

Thus, the anchorage-independent growth pattern observed after
the immunoselection process (Fig. 3A) prompted us to investigate
the expression of CD44 and CD24 on the surface of selected or
unselected MCF7 cells.
Briefly (24 hours) after the killing (Fig. 3B, bottom), the
proportion of CD44highCD24low7-AADnegative putative CSC was
found to reach 11% when naı̈ve MCF7 cells (left) and 23.5% when
already CSC-enriched immunoselected MCF7 cells (right) were
used for the coculture with NK cells and trastuzumab. Although
this enrichment for putative tumor-initiating cells was largely
transient—the proportion of recognizably stem cell–like cells
gradually decreased during re-expansion—MCF7 cells also revealed
a significant increase (6.2% versus 0.2%) in CD44highCD24low cells
after six cycles of treatment with polyclonal NK cells and
trastuzumab (Fig. 3B, right), indicating that immunoselection
increased the proportion of CSC over time. Likewise, treatment
of SK-BR-3, MDA-MB231, and BT474 breast cancer cells with
trastuzumab and polyclonal NK induced an enrichment of
CD44highCD24low cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that these cell lines
behave similar to MCF7. It should, however, be noted that the
association between CSC-like properties and the CD44highCD24low
subset has only been validated for the MCF7 cell line.
CD44highCD24low breast cancer cells show reduced HER2
surface expression and can give rise to CD44highCD24high
HER2high cells. To investigate their differentiation potential, we
purified CD44highCD24low MCF7 cells by FACS sorting and found
that they can regenerate a culture consisting of mostly CD24high
cells within 10 days (Fig. 4, left). Moreover, we observed HER2
surface expression to be significantly lower on the presumed stem

cell–like subset. Again, the sorted cell culture reverted quickly to
the initial phenotype (Fig. 4, right). Thus, the CD44highCD24low
HER2low population can give rise to CD44highCD24highHER2high
cells. The hypothesis that the relative resistance of CD44high
CD24low mammary carcinoma cells could be due to their low HER2
expression is further supported by the reduced HER2 expression
levels that we observed in the CD44highCD24low subsets of our
additional cell lines (specific fluorescence intensity values: 7.8
versus 11.6 for SK-BR-3, 2.1 versus 4.0 for MDA-MB-231, 104 versus
168 for BT474).
Immunoselected MCF7 cells display increased tumorigenicity in vivo. Finally, we investigated the clonogenicity and
tumorigenicity of the MCF7 cells that had undergone six cycles of
immunoselection. As shown in Fig. 3B, these cells displayed a
stable enrichment of CD44highCD24lowHER2low cells. Consequently,
they were able to form mammospheres, whereas control cells grew
only in small adherent colonies (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the
immunoselected cells were also more tumorigenic in vivo.
Although only one of five mice injected with 103 control MCF7
cells developed a tumor, immunoselected MCF7 cells induced
tumor formation in four of six mice (P = 0.18). When the mice were
inoculated with 104 cells, tumor growth was observed in two of five
(control) versus six of six (immunoselected) mice (P = 0.04; Fig. 5B).
These differences were confirmed by histologic assessment of the
respective tumor sizes (Fig. 5C). Finally, examination of the tumor
tissues revealed a far higher cell density and more mitoses in
tumors from immunoselected MCF7 cells (Fig. 5D). HER2
expression was low but detectable on all investigated tissues (data
not shown).

Figure 4. Sorted CD44highCD24low cells express
low levels of HER2 and can regenerate a
CD44highCD24lowHER2high population. Untreated
MCF7 breast cancer cells were stained and
CD44highCD24low cells were isolated by FACS sorting
(top and middle ). Expression of HER2 was analyzed
simultaneously (right ). After 10 d of in vitro culture,
the sorted cells were reanalyzed for CD44,
CD24, and HER2 expression (n = 3).

Figure 5. Immunoselected MCF7 cells display increased clonogenicity and tumorigenicity. A, 6 immunoselected or naı̈ve MCF7 cells were seeded at low cell
densities in 24-well plates (100 and 500 cells per well). After 18 d, the formation of mammospheres and small adherent colonies was determined under an inverted
microscope and the percentage of colony-forming cells was calculated. *, P < 0.01. B, 103 (top ) or 104 (bottom ) naı̈ve (n = 5 per cell number) or immunoselected (n = 6)
MCF7 cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of NOD/Scid-mice. Tumor formation was monitored by palpating. C, on day 58, tumors were explanted,
embedded in paraffin, cut into 10-Am slices, and stained with H&E. The maximum two-dimensional area of each tumor was measured using a caliper. D, representative
HE stains of tumors formed from 104 naı̈ve or immunoselected MCF7 cells were recorded at 10, 20, 40, and 100 initial magnification as indicated.

Discussion
Experience with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs or modern
‘‘targeted’’ therapies has shown that cancer therapeutics often only
delay the progress of the disease. This is frequently observed with
the humanized HER2-specific IgG1 antibody trastuzumab that can
yield extraordinary initial responses against HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer until the disease relapses. Other HER2-positive
malignancies altogether fail to respond. Resistance against
trastuzumab has largely been explained by redundancy in growth
factor receptor signaling that allows a transformed cell to
compensate for the blockade of HER2. However, because NK
cell–mediated ADCC was shown to be important for the in vivo
function of the antibody (18), we wondered whether the failure to
respond to trastuzumab might also be related to tumor immune

escape, especially because the continuous confrontation with the
host immune system is likely to trigger some kind of ‘‘immunoediting’’ (29). Thus, we have confirmed that trastuzumab induces
ADCC when SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer and MCF7 mammary
carcinoma cells are coincubated with polyclonal NK cells
(Figs. 1A and 2A). When we investigated those cells that survived
a single or repeated ADCC challenge, two different mechanisms
of resistance against ADCC- and ADCC-independent NK cell–
mediated killing became apparent:
The ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3 down-regulates HER2
surface expression (Fig. 1C) and becomes largely resistant to the
ADCC component of the NK cell–mediated killing. Because
activated NK cells secrete large amounts of IFN-g, these effects
might be due to a previously described IFN-g–dependent promoter
methylation (41, 42). This effect further suggests that the cells do

Escape of HER2 low Breast Cancer Stem Cells from ADCC

not depend on high HER2 expression, which may explain the poor
response of ovarian cancer cells to trastuzumab. In the absence of
trastuzumab, however, NK cell–mediated lysis did not differ
between ‘‘naı̈ve’’ and immunoselected SK-OV-3 cells, indicating
that the cells did not become refractory to NK cell killing in
general.
Breast cancer cells, however, showed a fundamentally different
behavior because neither HER2 surface expression nor sensitivity
toward NK cell–mediated killing or ADCC was altered by the
immunoselection process. This is in line with studies that showed
HER2 expression levels to remain mostly unaltered under therapy
with HER2-specific antibodies in humans (43) and in mice (44).
However, in vivo experiments based on the transfer of spontaneous
tumors from HER2-transgenic mice into congenic wild-type
animals showed that IFN-g–dependent immunoediting (42) can
promote both permanent tumor rejection or the delayed outgrowth
of antigen-loss variants with reduced ability to induce ‘‘danger
signals’’ (45).
In our experiments, another mechanism of immunoselection
became evident: The few surviving cells formed mammosphere-like
structures (Fig. 3A) that are characteristic for stem cell–like breast
cancer cells (23). Importantly, a small subset of highly tumorigenic
CSCs has been described in the MCF7 cell line and found to be
characterized by drug efflux (39) and a CD44highCD24low phenotype
(24). A flow cytometric analysis in MCF7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB231,
and BT474 cells indeed revealed a highly significant enrichment of
CD44highCD24low cells (Fig. 3B and C) briefly after ADCC. Although
this increase largely normalized upon re-expansion after immunoselection or cell sorting (Fig. 4), the repeatedly selected and reexpanded MCF7 cells also showed a lasting enrichment in these
putative CSC. Consequently, these cells displayed increased
clonogenicity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Although these
data suggest that CSC selectively survived the immunoselection
process, we cannot exclude that the ADCC challenge actually
induced CSC through dedifferentiation. In fact, it has been shown
that both CD4+ (46) and CD8+ T cells can promote epithelial to
mesenchymal transition and thereby induce CD44highCD24low
breast cancer CSC in HER2-transgenic mice in vivo (47).
Irrespective of the precise mechanism, our findings clearly support
the CSC model and suggest that breast cancer CSC are resistant to
the combination of NK cells and trastuzumab.
This observed immune-refractory phenotype of CSC may partly
be due to reduced binding of trastuzumab. However, because
ADCC-independent NK cell cytotoxicity was also present in our
experiment, further investigations regarding the susceptibility

of CSCs toward NK cell–mediated immunotherapy are clearly
needed (37).
Clinically, our findings have important implications: Although
relapse has traditionally been interpreted as the outgrowth of
therapy-resistant tumor cell clones, this may only be correct in a
subgroup of tumors (represented, e.g., by the ovarian cancer cell
line SK-OV-3). In the remainder (represented by our breast cancer
cell lines), the resistance against ADCC may be due to the increased
resistance of CSC. Accordingly, these CSC would regenerate the
tumor after initial therapy-induced regression. Thus, treatment
with trastuzumab should be complemented by a therapy that is
more effective against CSC (48). However, although such a
therapeutic approach is not yet available for breast cancer, our
data also suggest that a ‘‘rechallenge’’ with trastuzumab alone or in
combination with another HER2-specific antibody like pertuzumab
could be beneficial for the treatment of tumors that have initially
shown a good response to the antibody and then relapsed. In fact,
this is supported by recent clinical observations (49). Moreover, the
fact that MCF7 cells maintained their level of HER2 expression
despite the selection pressure exerted by trastuzumab and NK cells
implicates that HER2 may be much more essential for mammary
than for ovarian carcinoma cells—and thus be a much better target
in breast cancer (which is again in line with the clinical reality).
Finally, the fact that ADCC occurs with HER2-positive tumor cells
suggests that tumors that altogether fail to respond to trastuzumab
effectively suppress ADCC. Thus, trastuzumab (or an optimized
more immunogenic antibody; ref. 33) might still become beneficial
for those cases provided that a general immunologic unresponsiveness could be overcome (50). Accordingly, trastuzumab may
not only synergize with established chemotherapeutics, but also
with experimental immunotherapies.
