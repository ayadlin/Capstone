Abstract
Menopausal estrogen (E2) replacement therapy increases the risk of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). Whether E2 is tumorigenic or promotes expansion of undiagnosed preexisting
disease is unknown. To determine E2 effects on tumor promotion, we developed an intraperitoneal mouse
xenograft model using ZsGreen fluorescent ER− 2008 and ER+ PEO4 human EOC cells. Tumor growth was
quantified by in vivo fluorescent imaging. In ER+ tumors, E2 significantly increased size, induced progesterone
receptors, and promoted lymph node metastasis, confirming that ERs are functional and foster aggressiveness.
Laser-captured human EOC cells from ER− and ER+ xenografted tumors were profiled for expression of
E2-regulated genes. Three classes of E2-regulated EOC genes were defined, but <10% were shared with
E2-regulated breast cancer genes. Because breast cancer selective ER modulators (SERM) are therapeutically
ineffective in EOC, we suggest that our EOC-specific E2-regulated genes can assist pharmacologic discovery
of ovarian-targeted SERM. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8927–36. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) was hailed as the
preserver of femininity, and before 1980, it represented >67%
of postmenopausal hormone prescriptions (1). However,
because unopposed ERT increased uterine cancer risk, hysterectomy became a prerequisite. This procedure removed the
uterus, leaving the ovaries intact and susceptible to neoplastic
transformation. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a menopausal disease whose relative risk (RR) rises in the sixth and
seventh decades of life from basal levels (RR, 1.0) in untreated
women to RR of 1.22 to 1.72 in women prescribed ERT more
than 5 years (2–6). Although epidemiologic data postulate a link
between extended ERT and EOC, causality has not been proven.
Two alternative hypotheses exist: that ERT directly causes neoplastic transformation of ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), or
that ERT promotes proliferation and metastasis of preexisting,
occult disease. Evidence for the first hypothesis is found in the
facts that estrogen (E2) levels in ovarian tissues exceed circulating levels by 100-fold, and E2 has direct genotoxic effects in
breast cancers (7). The second hypothesis postulates that

prolonged ERT promotes proliferation and expansion of preexisting malignancy. In fact, 38% to 62% of EOCs are estrogen
receptor-α (ER) positive (8, 9), making them good targets for
E2 stimulation. Ovarian tumors from older women (≥65 years),
although more likely to be ER+, are less likely to express progesterone receptors (PR; ref. 10). This paucity of PR may suggest
that ER signaling becomes deficient with aging.
Here, we test aspects of the second hypothesis that ERT
promotes expansion of preexisting malignancy. Using highly
fluorescent ER− and ER+ human ovarian cancer cell lines
engrafted in the peritoneum of nude mice, we developed a
site-specific, rigorously controlled, quantitative xenograft
model of ERT-stimulated ovarian cancer. We show that
ERT substantially increases proliferation and risk of distant
lymph node (LN) metastasis only in ER+ tumors, possibly
through E2 regulation of cellular motility genes. Additionally,
we identify E2-regulated genes specific to ER+ ovarian cancers, and not shared with ER+ breast cancers. We propose
that these genes can be used for pharmacologic discovery
and interventions with E2 antagonists that uniquely target
ER+ ovarian cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
PEO4 cells (11) were a gift from Dr. Anne Bowcock
(Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and 2008 cells (12)
were obtained from Southwestern Medical School (Dallas,
TX). Cell lines were authenticated by polymorphic short tandem repeat analysis at the University of Colorado DNA
Sequencing and Analysis Core before xenografting (July 2008
and May 2010). Cells were routinely cultured at 37°C and 5%
CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were

tagged with ZsGreen by retroviral transduction (13) and
routinely tested for absence of Mycoplasma.
Mouse xenografts
Studies were University of Colorado Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee approved. Ovariectomized female
athymic nude mice (5–6 weeks of age; Harlan SpragueDawley) were anesthetized with Avertin and injected i.p. with
107 ZsGreen-tagged ovarian cancer cells. A silastic pellet containing 2 mg cellulose or 17β-estradiol (E2) was implanted
subcutaneously (14). Mice were weighed and monitored
weekly for fluorescent tumor burden using Illumatool Bright
Light System LT-9500 (Lightools Research). At necropsy,
uteri were weighed to document appropriate estrogenization
and fluorescent tumors were resected. Tumor samples were
frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound for gene
expression profiling or fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C and paraffin embedded for pathology and
immunohistochemical analyses.
IVIS imaging
Biweekly fluorescent quantitative tumor imaging was done
with IVIS 200 Optical Imaging System (Xenogen, Caliper Life
Sciences) in live mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Living
Image 2.60.1 (Caliper Life Sciences) software was used for
quantitative analysis at 0.5-, 1-, and 5-second time points.
Fluorescent background subtraction was performed, and
data were displayed in log scale photons, flat fielded, with
cosmic ray correction. Each abdominal region of interest
(ROI) quantitation was 3.05 cm by 4.12 cm; a separate thoracic background ROI was 2.23 cm by 1.79 cm. Statistical
analysis used Student's t test for the difference between control and E2-treated groups at each time point, and Fisher's
exact test for differences in categorical variables. Cell doubling times were calculated from exponential growth curves
derived from the fluorescent imaging data. Graphs were created in GraphPad Prism 5.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histology and immunohistochemistry were conducted
according to standard protocols (15). Antibodies used were as
follows: ER (1:20, SP1 clone RM9101; LabVision/NeoMarkers),
PR (1:500, PgR1294 clone M3568; Dako), and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 1:50, 347580; Becton Dickinson). A Nikon Eclipse
Ti microscope, Ds-Fi1 color camera, and NIS Elements AR 3.1
software were used for digital photography. Human ovarian
tumor tissue arrays were from BioChain Institute and stained
for ER and PR.
Proliferation
After 10 to 12 weeks of tumor growth, 200 μL BrdUrd (Sigma)
at 10 mg/mL in PBS was injected i.p. 3 hours before sacrifice.
BrdUrd incorporation into DNA was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The proliferative fraction was calculated by dividing
the number of BrdUrd-positive nuclei by the number of total
nuclei per high-power field. A minimum of three high-power
fields/tumor and a minimum of three independent tumors
were counted for each cell line and condition.

Gene expression profiling
Intraperitoneal tumors from 2008 and PEO4 cells were frozen at necropsy from quadruplicate −E2- and +E2-treated
mice. Human tumor cells were laser dissected from surrounding mouse tissues using an Autopix 100e (Molecular
Devices). RNA was isolated (Picopure RNA Isolation kit,
Molecular Devices), amplified (WT-Ovation FFPE RNA
Amplification System V2, NuGEN), and biotin labeled (FLOvation cDNA Biotin Module V2, NuGEN). RNA integrity
was confirmed (Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent). One −E2 PEO4
replicate was degraded and excluded from analyses. Samples
were hybridized to U133 Plus 2.0 (Affymetrix) whole human
genome expression arrays in the University of Colorado
Cancer Center Microarray Core. Gene expression analysis
used Partek software. An ANOVA analysis was done with
hormone and cell type as fixed factors and an interaction
between hormone and cell type included. Genes absent
across all cell types were filtered out, and genes with a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between hormone and cell type
were filtered in. Statistically significant genes were sorted by
highest-fold expression change between PEO4 −E2 versus
+E2 treatments, and with no significant change in 2008 −E2
versus +E2 treatment. Supervised clustering analysis was
performed using standard correlation as similarity measure
and an average linkage clustering algorithm (GeneSpring
GX7.3.1). Overlapping gene lists were generated using GeneSpring (GX7.3.1). E2-regulated breast cancer gene lists were
obtained from published data (16–18). Microarray data have
been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (accession
number GSE22600; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE22600).

Results
Fluorescent ovarian cancer intraperitoneal xenograft
mouse model
Two different human serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines
were engrafted in immunodeficient mice: 2008 cells (12),
which are ER− and PR−, served as controls for PEO4 cells
(11), which are ER+ and PR+. Both cell lines were stably transduced with a ZsGreen expressing retrovirus for bright permanent green fluorescence. Female athymic nude mice,
ovariectomized 4 to 6 weeks after birth to remove endogenous E2 and estrous cycling, were injected i.p. with 107 cells,
and tumors were allowed to grow for 60 to 70 days. Figure 1A
shows fluorescent imaging at necropsy of ER− 2008 ovarian
tumor small-bowel implants. Figure 1B shows ER+ PEO4
disease, which exhibits the hallmarks of advanced ovarian
cancer—peritoneal studding (arrow), bowel implants, and
omental implants (asterisk). At necropsy, intraperitoneal disease was visible in 67% (42 of 62) of mice bearing ER− 2008
tumors and in 69% (50 of 72) of mice bearing ER+ PEO4
tumors. Concordance between the two indicates that the
ovariectomized mouse peritoneum provides a hospitable
environment for tumor growth. Both 2008 and PEO4 tumors
show similar histology, morphologically consistent with
high-grade EOC. The ER− 2008 implants (Fig. 1C) have irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, loose cell association, and

moderate mitotic activity. The ER+ PEO4 nodules (Fig. 1D)
show cohesive cells with distinct cell membranes, prominent
nuclei, large nucleoli, and moderate mitotic activity.
Intraperitoneal ovarian tumor burden is significantly
increased by ERT
E2 falls from 128 pg/mL physiologic levels in the normal
cycling mouse to 31 pg/mL in ovariectomized mice. E2 supplementation with 17β-estradiol–releasing pellets implanted
subcutaneously restores blood levels to 139 pg/mL (14). We
confirmed restoration of physiologic E2 by measuring uterine
weights. Mean control uterine weights were 0.06 g in E2deprived ovariectomized mice and 0.18 g in E2-supplemented
mice, a statistically significant increase (P = 0.002).
After establishing the physiologic effectiveness of E2
supplementation, we assessed E2 effects on tumor volumes.
Qualitative fluorescent examination of intraperitoneal ER−
2008 tumors at necropsy failed to reveal a significant E2
effect on disease volume (Supplementary Fig. S1A, B, E,
and F). In contrast, prolonged E2 significantly increased
the intraperitoneal disease volume in ER+ PEO4 implants
(Supplementary Fig. S1C, D, G, and H). Differences in tumor
volume in response to E2 were confirmed by quantifying
tumor fluorescence by photon flux IVIS imaging (Fig. 2).
Figure 2A shows serial quantitation of ER− 2008 implants.
Fluorescent images were obtained 22, 49, and 63 days after
i.p. injection of tumor cells in five control (left) and five
E2-treated (right) mice. Data plotted as mean and SEM for
nine control and nine E2-treated mice (Fig. 2B) clearly show
that the points overlap (P = 0.42, 0.83, and 0.69 for 22, 49, and

63 days, respectively), indicating that ER− 2008 ovarian tumor
implants are not E2 responsive. In contrast, quantitation of
ER+ PEO4 tumor volume showed a significant increase with
E2. Figure 2C illustrates 10 ovariectomized mice bearing
PEO4 implants 22, 49, and 63 days after i.p. injection without
(left) or with (right) E2 supplementation. At 22 days, the
control and ERT points overlap (P = 0.46), but by 49 days,
disease volume in the ERT mice was significantly increased
(P = 0.033) and rose further at 63 days (P = 0.013). Exponential growth curves plotted from the fluorescent data show
that 2008 control cells have a doubling time of 38.74 days,
which is similar to the 35.31 day doubling time for 2008 E2
cells (not shown). On the other hand, PEO4 control cells have
a doubling time of 93.25 days, which is accelerated to 18.08
days for PEO4 E2 cells (not shown).
Prolonged ERT promotes LN metastases
Proliferation of intraperitoneal tumors is a hallmark of
advanced-stage EOC. Additionally, 10% of patients exhibit
extraperitoneal LN metastases, an ominous finding (19).
Figure 3 shows our ability to model ovarian tumor cell translocation from the abdominal cavity to extraperitoneal LN.
Figure 3A shows in situ liver, heart, and lungs of a mouse
bearing ER+ PEO4 tumors. Paired bilateral LNs are clearly
fluorescent (arrows), indicating the presence of tumor cells.
Figure 3B shows histologic confirmation of PEO4 tumor cells
(arrow) infiltrating under the nodal capsule and pushing
against lymphoid tissues. Histologically, PEO4 cells metastatic to LN resemble PEO4 cells in the peritoneum (compare
Figs. 1C and 3B). LN metastases were present in 6% (2 of 33)

(10 of 39) of ER+ PEO4 mice and to 9% (3 of 33) of ER− 2008
mice with E2 supplementation. In this model, ERT is associated with a significant (P = 0.03) increase in metastases in
ER+ PEO4 mice.
In ER+ tumors, prolonged ERT induces PRs
Thirty-six percent of EOCs express both ER+ and PR+ (8).
The quantitative increase in PEO4 tumor burden in E2supplemented mice (Fig. 2D) suggested that ERs were present and functional. Figure 4 is an immunohistochemical

LN metastases in the presence of E2. In contrast to 2008
tumors that lack ER (Fig. 4A), PEO4 implants from ovariectomized mice without E2 supplementation express high ER
levels (Fig. 4B). PRs are absent in both types of tumors
(Fig. 4E and F). With E2, high levels of ER were maintained
in the PEO4 intraperitoneal implants and LN metastases
(Fig. 4C and D). Additionally, E2 treatment induced PR,
indicating that the ERs were functional (Fig. 4G and H).
We noted that ER and especially PR expression was
heterogeneous, with some cells strongly positive and others
having lower or negative receptor levels. We asked whether
similar heterogeneity existed in a human ovarian serous

(Supplementary Fig. S2). Overall, 17 of 66 (27%) of tumors
were ER+/PR+, whereas another 10 of 66 (15%) were ER+/
PR − . They showed heterogeneity of receptor expression
analogous to the xenografts.
E2 promotes proliferation of ER+ ovarian tumors
Having shown that ERs are functional in PEO4 tumors,
we next asked whether the known mitogenic effects of E2
in endometrial and breast cancers were similarly demonstrable in ovarian cancers (20). To that end, tumor-bearing mice
were injected with BrdUrd before necropsy, and its incorporation into S-phase DNA was quantified by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5). Proliferating cells were present at basal

states in both 2008 and PEO4 tumors of ovariectomized mice
without E2 supplementation (Fig. 5A). With E2, the number
of positive nuclei increased in the PEO4 implants but not
in the 2008 implants (Fig. 5A). Quantitation of the BrdUrd
incorporation (Fig. 5B) shows that without E2, more cells
are undergoing mitosis in 2008 cells (10.7%) than in PEO4
cells (5.5%), suggesting that, on average, 2008 cells are more
aggressive. However, E2 significantly (P = 0.0001) increased
the proliferative fraction of ER + PEO4 tumor implants
(23.9%) while having nonsignificant (P = 0.188) effects on
ER− 2008 tumors (13.6%). This suggests that E2 increases
the aggressiveness of ER+ disease. The BrdUrd proliferation
data mirror the growth doubling times calculated from the
fluorescent data in Fig. 2A and C. PEO4 control cells had

in the presence or absence of E2, but PRs require E2 for induction. ER and PR distribute heterogeneously. Scale bars, 10 μm.

the slowest doubling time, which was significantly accelerated by E2. The intermediate doubling times of 2008 cells were
unaffected by E2.
E2-regulated genes of ER+ ovarian cancer differ from
those of ER+ breast cancer
To define transcriptional pathways regulated by ERT in
ovarian cancers, ER+ PEO4 and ER− 2008 tumor implants
from ovariectomized control and E2-treated mice were gene
expression profiled. To insure that only human cells were
analyzed, quadruplicate sets of human cells were first laser
captured from tumors to separate them from surrounding
mouse cells. RNA was obtained from human tumor cells of
the four experimental conditions, which were hybridized to
human microarrays and gene expression profiled (Materials
and Methods). Fig. 6 shows the supervised hierarchical cluster analysis of genes from untreated (−) and E2-treated (+)
PEO4 and 2008 tumors that are relatively upregulated (red)
or downregulated (blue) compared with unchanged genes.
Each column represents an individual tumor, and each row
a unique gene probe set. To be considered significantly
regulated, each gene had to pass strict statistical ANOVA
criteria for cell line and hormone interaction (P < 0.05) as
well as >1.5-fold expression changes.
The heat map indicates that E2-responsive genes fall into
one of three categories arbitrarily defined as class A, B, and C.
In Fig. 6A, genes from ER+ PEO4 +E2 tumors cluster to the far
left, whereas genes from the −E2 control tumors cluster to
their right. The two tumor types originate from different
gene branches (top). In contrast, the ER− 2008 samples cluster randomly with regard to control or +E2 status. Class A
genes (Fig. 6A, top) are ones whose expression is low (blue)

8932

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

and independent of E2 in ER− 2008 tumor implants, similarly
low in −E2 ER+ PEO4 implants, but upregulated (red) by +E2
in ER + PEO4 implants. Class A genes were expected to
include classic E2-inducible transcripts. In fact, PR transcripts called PGR, well known to be E2 regulated (21), fell
into this category and were significantly induced by E2 in
ER+ PEO4 tumors. E2 induction of PR transcript expression
validates the statistical analysis and confirms the PR protein
immunohistochemical data (Fig. 4G). A second known
E2-regulated transcript of interest, called gene regulated by
estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1), was also identified
(22). Supplementary Table S1 lists the class A genes.
Class B genes (Fig. 6A, bottom) are constitutively high
(red) in ER− 2008 tumor implants independent of E2 treatment. In ER+ PEO4 tumors, their expression is low in the
absence of E2 (blue), but they are E2 inducible (red). Class B
genes have lost regulation by E2 in ER− ovarian cancer cells—
their upregulation having been hijacked by other signaling
pathways—while retaining E2 regulation in ER+ ovarian cancer
cells. Several class B genes previously defined as having roles in
ovarian cancer metastasis and stem cell signatures included
CD44 (23). Palladin (24) and fascin 1 (25) are cellular motility
genes whose expression was not previously suspected as being
E2 regulated. Supplementary Table S2 lists class B genes.
Class C genes (Fig. 6B) are constitutively high (red) in
E2-deprived ER+ PEO4 cells but downregulated by E2 (blue).
Sixteen class C genes were identified with known E2 regulation, including KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3 (KDELR3), an interesting
gene linked to chemotherapy response in ovarian cancers
(26). ROPN1 is a cancer-associated testis antigen, which is
more highly expressed in ER− than in ER+ breast cancers

(27). Supplementary Table S3 lists class C genes. Quantitative
PCR confirmed the E2-regulated expression of a subset of class
A, B, and C genes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Six genes were
selected for quantitative PCR, and each one was statistically
differentially expressed in each class for a 100% validation rate.
Our laboratory has previously published E2-regulated
genes in T47D human breast cancer cells using a similar E2supplemented nude mouse xenograft model (17). We compared
our E2-regulated ovarian cancer genes to the previously defined
breast cancer genes and found that only three class A genes
(NEDD9, FBXL7, and CA12) and three class C genes (B3GNT3,
GLDC, and PPAP2B) were shared. Next, we compared the class
A and B E2-regulated ovarian cancer genes with other previously published E2-regulated breast cancer genes (16–18). Surprisingly, only 6.8% (10 of 146) of class A and 9.9% (15 of 152) of class
B ovarian cancer genes overlapped with E2-regulated breast
cancer genes (16–18). Shared class A and B genes are listed in
Supplementary Table S4.

Discussion
Epidemiologic meta-analyses assessing menopausal ERT
show a combined RR of 1.22 of developing EOC after 5 years
of E2 use (3). The role of E2 in the development and promo-

tion of EOC is unclear. We hypothesized that prolonged ERT
promotes growth and metastasis of preexisting ER+ EOC cells
through activation of specific gene expression programs. To
test this, we developed a mouse model of preexisting disease
that allows quantitative assessment of ovarian tumor burden
in response to E2 exposure. Our model uses ZsGreen fluorescence, allowing external serial visualization of tumor implants
and quantitation by emission fluorescent photon flux, in
living mice.
By using E2 supplementation in an ovariectomized mouse,
the specific effects of estrogenization can be analyzed. This
model produces serum E2 levels of 125 pg/mL (14), similar to
the range obtained in women (28). We find that compared
with ovariectomized mice, continuous ERT significantly
increased fluorescence signal intensity in mice bearing ER+
PEO4 tumor implants (Fig. 2D). The increase was due to
E2-induced cell proliferation as quantified from exponential
growth curves (Fig. 2D) and by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 5B).
As expected, ERT had no effect on the proliferative index of
ER− 2008 tumors. This confirmed our hypothesis that ERTinduced growth of ovarian cancer cells is limited to ER+ disease. Modeling the action of ERT in ovariectomized mice at
the natural site of ovarian cancer implantation is critically
important. Previously, Langdon and colleagues (29) implanted
PEO4 cells for 4 weeks in the flank of intact cycling nude

Figure 6. Supervised hierarchical clustering of genes expressed in ovarian cancers identifies three ERT-regulated subgroups in ER+ disease. ER− 2008
or ER+ PEO4 ovarian tumor cells were grown i.p. in ovariectomized nude mice supplemented without (−) or with (+) E2-releasing pellets for ∼11 wk.
Tumors were harvested and human cells were laser captured from frozen sections. RNA was hybridized to U133 Plus 2.0 whole human genome expression
arrays. Statistical analyses were performed as described in Materials and Methods. Statistically significant genes were sorted by highest-fold expression
change between PEO4 −E2 versus +E2, and with no significant change in 2008 −E2 versus +E2. Each column represents a separate tumor, and each
row a transcript. Red (high) and blue (low) indicate relative transcript expression levels. A, genes regulated in ER+ PEO4 versus ER− 2008 showing
class A and B genes that are upregulated by E2 only in ER+ cells; they are constitutively low (class A) or high (class B) in ER− cells. B, class C genes
are downregulated by E2 from high basal levels in ER+ cells; they are constitutively low in ER− cells.

mice before ERT supplementation. Paradoxically, growth was
inhibited in comparison with controls. Significant experimental differences between our models include use of cycling mice
by Langdon and colleagues (29), in which progestational
influences are retained (30). Our ovariectomized model allows
independent future assessment of the role of progesterone
alone or when combined with E2 as in EPRT hormone replacement therapies.
Two previously published reports of E2-regulated genes in
ovarian cancer cell lines were in vitro and used short-term E2
stimulation. O'Donnell and colleagues (31) identified 5 E2upregulated and 23 E2-downregulated genes in PEO1 ovarian
cancer cells. We compared our class A genes with their
upregulated genes, and our class C genes with their downregulated genes, and only two overlapped. One of these, Cyr61,
whose protein product promotes cell adhesion, was E2
downregulated in the study by O'Donnell and colleagues, but
E2-upregulated class B in ours. E2 upregulation of Cyr61 agrees
with previous reports in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (32). The
second study (33) used transformed human ovarian surface
epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cell lines. The authors
identified 155 E2-regulated genes in ovarian surface epithelium cells, and 315 in cell lines, of which 19 overlapped between
the two models. There were no exact matches between those
19 and our E2-regulated genes.
Our study is the first to identify E2-regulated genes in ER+
ovarian cancer xenografts using ER− tumors as negative
controls. This comparison was essential to identification of
class B genes, which are constitutively high in ER− tumors,
but E2 regulated in ER+ tumors. Class B may represent genes
critical to the transition from E2 sensitivity to E2 independence. Intriguingly, 15 of the class B genes were “cell motility” genes, including CD44 (34) and fascin 1 (35). None of
the class B motility genes have been previously identified
as E2 regulated.
The importance of E2 regulation of cell motility in ovarian
cancer is further supported by our striking observation
that mice treated with prolonged ERT preferentially developed distant LN metastases (Fig. 3). Although metastases
occurred in both ER+ and ER− tumors, they were significantly
increased by ERT only in ER+ tumors. ERT may also promote
metastasis through direct action on the metastatic niche
in the host compartment explaining its more subtle effects
in ER− disease. Previously, E2 has been shown to regulate
the host compartment of ovariectomized mice to promote
lung metastasis of ER− lung and mammary carcinoma cell
lines (36).
PR, the canonical E2-regulated gene in the breast, is also
E2 regulated in PEO4 cells (37). E2 induction of PR served
as an internal control for our models and was a highly
expressed class A gene. E2 regulation of PR was confirmed
by immunohistochemistry in PEO4 tumors (Fig. 4) and was
found to be heterogeneous, analogous to human ovarian
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2). Areas of high PR expression
are not exclusively restricted to areas of high ER expression,
which may indicate that ERs are downregulated in some cells
within tumors. Heterogeneity of ER and PR expression within
ovarian tumors may explain conflicting results on the cor-

relation between receptor expression and survival advantage
(38–40). Maintenance of functional ER in younger ovarian
cancer patients, as evidenced by coexpression of PR (10),
gives support to our hypothesis that a subset of ovarian
cancers is E2 regulated. Our gene expression profiles are
most applicable to this subgroup of patients.
The presence of E2-upregulated genes in EOC makes antiestrogen therapy an attractive premise. Although antiestrogens have been a mainstay of breast cancer treatment, in
EOC they have been reserved for chemotherapy-refractory
tumors, where they have a relatively low overall response
rate. In a Gynecologic Oncology Group study of recurrent
EOC (41), tamoxifen elicited an 18% response rate, correlated
with ER expression. The pure antiestrogen fulvestrant stabilized 50% of disease, but few tumors regressed (42). A similar
response rate was seen with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, where 20% of patients had stable disease for at least
12 weeks on therapy (43). The response correlated with high
expression of ER and PR, defining an “endocrine-sensitive”
subgroup (43).
Current selective ER modulators (SERM) such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant were designed to regulate genes in breast
and bone. The lack of significant response to SERM in EOC
may reflect poor tissue specificity of current agents, including differences in the tissue repertoire of ER coregulators in
ovarian versus breast tumors, rather than bona fide attenuation of ERα signaling. Our ERT-regulated ovarian cancer
genes represent the largest collection of potential therapeutic
targets in the literature. SERM could be screened against
these genes to identify compounds likely to have efficacy
and specificity in EOC.
Our data would suggest that administration of ERT to
women who have ovarian cancer should be viewed with
caution, but there are no clinical trials to suggest that this
worsens prognosis (44). One small prospective clinical trial
of ERT administered to ovarian cancer patients suggested
that ERT was associated with prolonged survival. However,
the study failed to stratify the patients by tumor ER expression either at enrollment or at time of recurrence (45).
Interestingly, addition of a progestin to estradiol (EPRT)
for menopausal hormone replacement therapy seems to be
protective against EOC, but deleterious in breast cancer
(46). The differential tissue specificity of ERT versus EPRT
in the breast and ovary is likely to be mediated by differences
in gene expression patterns. We have compared the gene
expression profile of our PEO4 EOC tumors with previously
published E2-regulated gene data sets in breast cancer
(16–18). Less than 10% of the ovarian cancer genes are
shared with breast cancer genes. No single signaling pathway
was predominant in the shared cohort, a finding that emphasizes the importance of tissue-specific targeting of pharmacologic therapy. Although we have attributed the paucity of
overlap between our ovarian E2-regulated genes and E2regulated breast cancer genes to tissue specificity, differences
in cDNA arrays, data analysis, and time of E2 stimulation
may have also contributed to the perceived discrepancy.
In summary, we have developed a site-specific, rigorously
controlled, quantitative mouse model of E2-stimulated human

ovarian cancer growth. ERT substantially increased the risk of
distant LN metastasis, possibly through E2 regulation of cellular motility genes. Additionally, we have identified E2-regulated
genes specific to ovarian cancers. These can be used for
pharmacologic discovery and interventions that specifically
target ER+ ovarian cancers.
