Abstract
It has been proposed that chemotherapy enhances tumor
antigen (TA)–specific immunity. The molecular form of TA
from ovarian tumor that activates cellular immunity is
unknown. We report here identification of a novel molecular
form of immunogenic TA for CD8+ cells named self-immune
stimulatory multimolecular complexes (ISMMC). ISMMC
consist of a molecular complex of polyosome/ribosome-bound
ubiquitinated nascent HER-2 polypeptides. This complex is
chaperoned by heat shock protein Gp96, which mediates
ISMMC uptake by antigen-presenting cells through the
scavenger receptor CD91. RNAs in ISMMC stimulate immature
dendritic cells to secrete interleukin 12 and induce IFN-; in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ISMMC dissociate, retrotranslocate from the lysosome to cytoplasm, and are processed to peptides by the proteasome. At subpharmacologic
doses, Taxol increased the amount of ISMMC by three to four
times and modified their composition by inducing the
attachment of cochaperones of HSP70, such as the mitoticphase phosphoprotein 11J. On a total protein basis, Taxol
induced ISMMC, expanded more CD8+ cells, activated more
CD56+ NKG2D+ cells to produce IFN-;, and were more potent
inducers of high T-cell receptor density Perforin+ cells than
native ISMMC and peptide E75. Elucidation of the composition of ISMMC and identification of adducts formed by Taxol
should be important for developing molecular cancer vaccines. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8378–87]

Introduction
Chemotherapy by Taxol in advanced ovarian cancer results in
recovery of CD8+ T-cell function (1–3). Potentiation of immune
response has been attributed to Taxol-induced tumor apoptosis,
which releases tumor antigens (TA). However, the immunogenic
form of TA in cancer cells and how Taxol increases immunogenicity
are unknown.
We hypothesized that to activate immunity to cancer cells, TA
should be linked to molecules that mediate its uptake by antigen-

presenting cells (APC) and to activators of proinflammatory
cytokines in APC. We also hypothesized that for self-immunization,
the TA, as a complete molecule or as a shorter precursor of the
CTL-activating peptide (pCE), should be linked to ubiquitin in
positions that are sensitive to deubiquitinating enzymes. Binding
the optimal numbers of ubiquitin molecules in the correct position
ensures pCE-TA binding to the proteasome (4). The ubiquitinlinked form of pCE is essential for generating immunogenic
peptides because one molecule of pCE-TA competes with distinct
ubiquitin-linked molecules for proteasomal degradation.
Thus, we hypothesized that TA form molecular complexes with
accessory molecules implicated in these processes. We named
these unknown complexes self-immune stimulatory multimolecular complexes (ISMMC). To identify the composition and function
of ISMMC, we investigated which of the subcellular components of
SK-OV-3 cells activated TA-specific lytic CD8+ cells in the absence
of exogenous costimulation signals or the proinflammatory
cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12).
To characterize the activation of CD8+ cells, we quantified
expansion of cells bearing T-cell receptor density (TCR) for the
peptide HER-2 (369–377, also designated E75) in complex with
the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2 (5, 6). We found that the
heavy ribosomal fraction, i.e., polysomes separated in sucrose
gradient, was the most effective ISMMC with regard to E75-TCR+
cell proliferation and differentiation. The minimal ISMMC for
E75-TCR+ cells consisted of a pentamolecular complex formed by
nascent HER-2 polypeptides, ubiquitin, mRNA, rRNA, and Gp96.
Treatment of SK-OV-3 with Taxol significantly increased (by
four times) the amount of immunogenic polysomal ISMMC per cell
and its resistance to vacuolar proteases. The larger amount of
immunogenic Taxol-induced ISMMC can activate more T cells than
the native ISMMC from untreated tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cells lines. The cell lines SKOV-3, SKOV-3.A2, and 2774 were cultured as
described (7). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from five distinct
donors, designated PBMC-1 to PBMC-5, were isolated from distinct healthy
HLA-A2+ donors. Immature dendritic cells (iDC) used as APC were
generated as described (8). SK-OV-3 cells were cultured with GM-cyclin
(Boehringer) for 2 weeks before expansion. Mycoplasma and bacteria
contamination tests were negative. LPS in ribosome nascent chains (RNC)
was determined with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. RNCs were
essentially free of LPS. The amount of LPS determined (pg/mL) was
below of that needed to activate IL-12 in GM-CSF + IL-4–cultured iDC
(1–10 ng/mL) and mature APC (20 ng/mL; ref. 9). LPS was in the same
range with that reported for RNA preparations that were considered RNA

free (9). The amounts of LPS found were <5 pg/mL (RNC-IV), <3 pg/mL
(RNC-III), and <3 pg/mL (water).
RNA isolation. Cytoplasmic total RNA and polyadenylated mRNA were
isolated from detergent lysates of live (trypsin detached) SKOV-3 and 2774
cells with an RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen) and a GenElute-mRNA Miniprep kit
(Sigma Chemical Co.; ref. 8).
The RNC-KIF ISMMC were used as the positive control. To generate
KIF-NS, SK-OV-3 cells were infected with the recombinant vector KIF-NS.
KIF-NS consists of the attenuated recombinant strain of A/PR8/34, in which
the RNA encoding for NA-1 was replaced with a recombinant NA-1–E75
fusion RNA sequence (10).
The recombinant virus was allowed to replicate for 14 to 16 h.
Afterwards, SK-OV-3 were lysed, and the ribosome pellet was separated
from the nucleus-free fraction. RNPs, ribosomes, and polysomes were
separated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. The ribosomes and polysomes
separated in different gradient peaks. The polysomes were used to stimulate
DC and were tested for the presence of intact functional viral particles by
hemagglutination and infectivity of SKOV-3. The ribosomes from batches of
100 to 120  106 cells were separated on 15% to 50% sucrose gradients by
centrifugation at 50,000 g for 2 and 6 h, followed by RNA precipitation as
previously described (10).
Reagents. All reagents used for flow cytometry, cytokine detection,
endocytosis, phagocytosis inhibition, and Western blotting were obtained
from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal antibody (mAb)-19, which recognizes
the peptide HER-2 (378–394), was purchased from Lab Vision Corporation.
Bovine pancreatic RNase-A was obtained from Roche.
Actin-specific and ubiquitin-specific antibodies, cytochalasin-D, and
dansyl-cadaverine were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. Hsp70-, Gp96-,
MPM-2–, RAD23B-, and eIFE4-specific antibodies were from Abcam. Mpp11J–specific antibody was a gift from Dr. Elisabeth Craig (University of
Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Clinical grade Taxol was obtained from BristolMyers Squibb Company. Lox-1–specific antibody was from Cell Science,
CD91-specific antibody was from Gene Tex, Inc., and the ubiquitin-specific
mAb P4D1 was from Cell Signaling.
T cell activation. iDC (1  105) were incubated with equal amounts of
total RNA from each ISMMC in serum-free medium or with E75 (5 Ag/mL)
for 3 h before addition of autologous nonadherent PBMC. Isolated
nonadherent PBMC (1  107) were stimulated with 1  105 iDCs pulsed
with 100 ng of total RNA plus the corresponding amounts of bound proteins
from RIBO-17-Tx and RIBO-17. Cells were stained and quantified based on
the expression levels of TCR, CD8, and Perforin. The protein amount
corresponding to equal concentrations of total RNA is shown in Supplementary Table S1B. Because T cells were not purified, they are described
as PBMC. IL-12 was not added to cultures. IL-2 was added at a final
concentration of 150 IU/mL after 18-h incubation of APC with responders.
Inhibitors of Ag uptake by APC were used as described previously (11).
Cytokine induction, quantification, and CTL assays. All assays were
performed as we described previously (10, 12). IL-12 and IFN-g were
quantified 48 h after stimulation from the same culture. All CTL assays
were performed in triplicate. Effectors were incubated with specific
inhibitory antibodies for 30 min before addition to targets.
Ag-specific CD8+ T cells were considered to express high (hi), medium
(med), and low (lo) numbers of E75-TCR based on the levels of MFI
(E75-TCR; 101–102, 102–103, and 103–104, respectively) after interaction with
E75-HLA-A2–IgG dimers (10).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis used Student’s unpaired t test
(Microsoft Excel software). Asterisks identify experimental groups that were
significantly different (P < 0.05) from control groups. For graphic
representation of our results, we used Sigma Plot for Windows. P and R 2
values were calculated with the program Statview (Microsoft Excel).10
Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described
previously (10). Proteins were quantified by scanning densitometry using
the Image J1.34 software, version 1.61.

Results
SKOV-3 treated with subpharmacologic concentrations of
Taxol activates CD8+ cells. To identify what concentration of
Taxol induces tumor immunogenicity, we determined its effects on
tumor cells and leukocytes. Twelve hours after treatment with
42 nmol/L Taxol (equivalent to the pharmacologic dose in humans),
both CD83 and CD83+ dendritic cells (DC) decreased in number
by 90% and the expressions of CD83+ and HLA-DR+ molecules on
surviving cells decreased by 80%. A dose of Taxol 10 times less than
the pharmacologic dose in humans (i.e., 4.2 nmol/L) only
marginally affected (9% apoptotic cells) the viability of iDC, PBMC,
and nonadherent PBMC. Taxol induced accumulation of most
tumor cells in the G2-M phase when used at 42 nmol/L but
increased the number of SK-OV-3 in the S phase when used at
0.42 and 4.2 nmol/L (Supplementary Table S1A). These findings are
supported by reports that subpharmacologic, but not pharmacologic, doses of Taxol enhance the functional levels of the eukaryotic
initiation factor eIF-4E and activate translation in tumor cells
before inducing apoptosis (12, 13).
To determine whether Taxol-treated SK-OV-3 contain ISMMC,
Donor-1 iDC were added to untreated and Taxol-treated live SKOV-3. Nonadherent PBMC (>95% T cells) from healthy HLA-A2+
Donor 1 (Donor-1 PBMC) were added 1 h later. We found a significant increase (>2-fold) in the number of CD8+ E75–high TCR
(TCRhi), high-Perforin cells activated by 4.2 nmol/L Taxol-treated
SK-OV-3 relative to cells activated with untreated SK-OV-3
(Supplementary Table S1B).
Differentiation of E75-TCR+ cells to Perforin+ cells requires both
peptide and IL-2 as cofactors and is regulated by IFN-g (14). We
tested the effects of IL-12, E75 peptide plus IL-12, and polysomal
fraction IV [also called ribosome nascent chain IV (RNC-IV)] from
untreated SK-OV-3 on the differentiation of E75-TCR+ cells. IL-12
activated 6.5 times more E75-TCRhi Perforin+ cells from the
existent precursors and 2.7 times more E75-TCRhi Perforin+ cells
than did the untreated and Taxol (4.2 nmol/L)–treated SK-OV-3,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1C).
RNC-IV of untreated SK-OV-3 contained both APC and T-cell
stimulatory components because it activated thrice more E75TCRhi Perforin+ cells than did IL-12 alone (Supplementary Table
S1C). The positive control, peptide E75 + IL-12, activated 3.6 times
more E75-TCRhi Perforin+ cells than IL-12 did. Overall, RNC-IV
activated 19.5 times more (6.5  3) E75-TCRhi Perforin+ cells than
SK-OV-3 and 8.1 times more E75-TCRhi Perforin+ cells than Taxoltreated SK-OV-3 did. These findings are compatible with the
hypothesis that ISMMC are present in SK-OV-3 and that Taxol
increased their amount.
Ribosomes from Taxol-treated SK-OV-3 are more effective
activators of cytolysis than cytoplasmic and nuclear components. To verify the hypothesis that ISMMC are formed by
tumor polysomes, equal amounts of protein of the subcellular
fractions from Taxol (4.2 nmol/L)–treated SK-OV-3 were used to
stimulate PBMC-1 in the absence of exogenous IL-12. PBMC-1
activated by the ribosomal fraction showed greater lysis of SKOV-3.A2 than PBMC-1 activated by the nuclear and cytoplasmic
plus membrane fractions (Fig. 1A). SK-OV-3 lysis by ribosomeactivated PBMC-1 was comparable with that mediated by
RNC-IV–activated PBMC-1 (Fig. 1A). To verify that cells were
activated by ISMMC, PMBC were stimulated with polysomal
fractions RIBO-17 and RIBO-17-Tx (defined in Fig. 2A–C).
Inhibition of SK-OV-3 lysis by specific antibodies to lymphocyte
antigens indicated that CD8+ and CD56 + cells, but not CD4+

Figure 1. Isolated ribosomes from Taxol (Tx)-treated SK-OV-3 activate lytic effectors, IL-12, and IFN-g in PBMC from healthy donors. A, the ribosomal (R ) fraction
isolated from 4.2 nmol/L Taxol–treated SK-OV-3 was a stronger activator of cytolytic effectors than the cytoplasmic plus membrane (C+M ) and nuclear (N ) fractions.
A 4-h CTL assay at an effector-to-target ratio of 20:1. The percentage of specific lysis was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific SK-OV-3.A2 lysis by non–
antigen-activated PBMC from the SK-OV-3.A2 lysis by antigen-activated PBMC. RNC-IV is the heavy polysomal fraction isolated from the ribosomal pellet of SK-OV-3

both CD8+ and CD56+ cells. Sixteen-hour CTL assay at an effector-to-target ratio of 25:1. SK-OV-3.A2 cells were targets. Antibodies against CD8, CD56, and CD4 were
used to block lysis. Effectors contained 64% CD4+, 23% CD8+, and 11% CD56+ NKG2D+ cells. E75-TCRlo cells were 10% and E75-TCRhi were 2% to 3% of total
CD8+ cells. The experiment was done in triplicate. *P < 0.05, significant inhibition. The increase in numbers of CD56Bright NKG2D+ cells after activation by RIBO-17-Tx is

total RNA from the ribosomal fractions (R, R-Tx, N, N-Tx, RNC-IV, and RNC-IV-Tx ). Tx, subcellular fractions isolated from Taxol-treated cells. Equal amounts of protein
of C+M, C+M-Tx, N, N-Tx, R, and R-Tx were used for activation. Suramin, bafilomycin A, and chloroquine were added at the beginning of incubation with agonists
at concentrations of 30, 50, and 25 mmol/L, respectively. The percentage inhibition in cytokine production by chloroquine, bafilomycin, and suramin is calculated in
relation to the amount of cytokine found in cultures not treated with inhibitor. IL-12 induced by RNC-IV, RNC-KIF, R-Tx, R, N-Tx, and N versus 0.0 (unstimulated),

cells, were activated by ISMMC from both Taxol-treated and
untreated SK-OV-3. Anti-CD4 had a small and insignificant
inhibitory effect (Fig. 1B).
Ribosomes from Taxol-treated SK-OV-3 induced IL-12 and
IFN-; in PBMC. Activation/maturation stimuli delivered to APC
determine whether APC functions as an inducer of Th1 and Th2 or
induces immune tolerance (7, 15, 16). Differentiation of CD8+ cells
to effectors requires proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. To
identify which fraction of SK-OV-3 induced IL-12, PBMC-1 were
activated with the cytoplasmic plus membrane, nuclear, and
ribosomal fractions, and the amount of IL-12 (p70) produced was
determined. The nuclear and ribosomal, but not the cytoplasmic
plus membrane, fractions from both untreated and Taxol-treated
SK-OV-3 induced IL-12 (Fig. 1C). At equal RNA concentrations,
ribosomes from Taxol-treated SK-OV-3 induced more IL-12 than
ribosomes from untreated cells by almost 50%. To confirm that

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

RNA induced IL-12 in these APC, we used as the positive control
the RNC-KIF fraction from SK-OV-3 as the IL-12 inducer. RNC-KIF
consists of isolated polysomes from SK-OV-3 infected with the
recombinant influenza strain A/PR8/34 (see Materials and
Methods). Influenza virus RNA is a potent inducer of IL-12. RNCKIF induced significantly (thrice) more IL-12 than SK-OV-3
ribosomes, confirming that polysome-bound RNA induced IL-12.
To identify the pathways of activation of IL-12 by ISMMC, we
investigated the effects of specific inhibitors. IL-12 is produced
by signaling from transmembrane nucleotide receptors of the
P2Y family in response to poly-(A) tail and/or by intracellular
RNA receptors in response to the RNA sequence. Suramin, a
nonspecific inhibitor of the P2Y receptor family with a wide
range for transmembrane nucleotide receptor families, did not
inhibit IL-12 induction by RNC-IV and RNC-KIF (Fig. 1C).
Therefore, we concluded that extracellular RNA receptors were

not involved in IL-12 production. Bafilomycin A and choloroquine inhibited the amount of IL-12 induced by RNC-IV and the
positive control activator RNC-KIF by 45% and 85%, respectively
(results not shown).
Chloroquine disrupts endocytic vesicles, which release internalized proteins and nucleic acids into the cytoplasm. In contrast,
bafilomycin A inhibits vacuolar ATPases but does not induce
release of the vacuole contents into the cytoplasm (11). Because
chloroquine mediated almost complete inhibition of cytokines,
whereas bafilomycin A did so only partially, exogenous RNCs likely
reached the vacuolar compartments (i.e., endosomes and/or
lysosomes) and activated Toll-like receptors (TLR-3 and TLR-8)
in situ. Part of the RNA in ISMMC translocated to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and activated TLR-8 and/or RNA exited the
vacuoles and activated cytoplasmic RNA receptors. Similar results
were obtained for inhibition of IFN-g induction by chloroquine in
the same experiment (Fig. 1D). Therefore, induction of IL-12
required internalization of ISMMC and activation of intracellular
RNA receptors.
Subpharmacologic doses of Taxol increase the amount of
heavy polysomes in live SK-OV-3. To identify how Taxol changes
ISMMC, we quantified the amount of RNA in the polysomes of SKOV-3 separated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. Compared with
untreated cells, 4.2 nmol/L Taxol increased by four times the
amount of RNA and proteins attached to polysomes (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Table S2) without shifting the ribosome peaks.
These changes are consistent with activation of RNA synthesis by
low concentrations of Taxol followed by ribosome aggregation due
to ‘‘stalling’’ translation (17).
We characterized distribution of the nascent HER-2 polypeptides
on ribosomes. HER-2 polypeptides attached to RNA in the sucrosegradient (RIBO) fractions from untreated SK-OV-3 (RIBO-13, RIBO16, and RIBO-17) and from Taxol-treated SK-OV-3 (RIBO-13-Tx,
RIBO-16-Tx, and RIBO-17-Tx) were identified by probing with
mAb-19. The recognition site of the HER-2–specific mAb-19 is the
peptide 378 to peptide 394, which follows the sequence of E75

(peptides 369–377). We assumed that the reactivity of mAb-19 with
a HER-2 polypeptide indicates the presence of the E75 sequence in
the HER-2 chain.
Figure 2B shows the full-length nascent HER-2 chain (cHER-2)
and shorter HER-2 polypeptides bound to ribosomes. The shorter
HER-2 polypeptides with major reactivity with mAb-19 are 91 and
53 kDa in size (marked 1* and 3* on the blot and designated
p91HER-2 and p53HER-2, respectively).
Oligoubiquitinated HER-2 polypeptides are present on
polysomes from SK-OV-3. Taxol increased the amount of
ubiquitin-conjugated nascent polypeptides and brought Mpp11J to ISMMC. The proteasome preferentially degrades ubiquitinlinked proteins to peptides. At least four ubiquitin molecules linked
to a protein are needed for its conjugation to proteasome. Proteins
linked with one to two ubiquitin molecules, i.e., oligoubiquitinubiquitin(1–2) linked, are preferentially linked with three to five
additional ubiquitin molecules after endocytosis, translocated to
cytoplasm, and degraded by the proteasome. The proteasome
degrades ubiquitin(4–6)-linked proteins with priority over the
ubiquitin(n )-linked proteins (18, 19).
We reprobed the blots with P4D1, an antibody that recognizes
both oligo{ubiquitin(1–6)}-linked and poly{ubiquitin(n )}-linked proteins. More of a ubiquitin-linked polypeptide of the same length as
p53HER-2 was present in RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO-17-Tx fractions
than in RIBO-16 and RIBO-17. These results suggested that
p53HER-2 consisted of an ubiquitin-linked HER-2 fragment. The
amount of ubiquitin-linked p53 was several times higher in Taxoltreated SK-OV-3 than in untreated SK-OV-3. RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO17-Tx contained more ubiquitin(n )-linked proteins than RIBO-16
and RIBO-17 did. Ubiquitin-linked chains of the same length as
p91HER-2 were not detected in RIBO-16 and RIBO-17, suggesting
that p91HER-2 was not ubiquitin linked (Fig. 2C).
Gp96 was present in RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO-17-Tx in four times the
amount present in RIBO-16 and RIBO-17 (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S1B and C for fraction RIBO-17-Tx after purification in
a longer sucrose gradient). Mpp-11J, a cochaperone that binds

Table S1A and B. B, sucrose-gradient ribosomal (R ) fractions 16 and 17 from control and 4.2 nmol/L Taxol–treated (16T and 17T ) SK-OV-3 contain two main
HER-2 fragments of 53 and 91 kDa (1 * and 3*, respectively). The amount of each HER-2 polypeptide, detected with mAb-19, was quantified by scanning densitometry.
C, Taxol increases the amounts of poly{ubiquitin(n )}-linked proteins in RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO-17-Tx compared with RIBO-16 and RIBO-17. Ubiquitin(oligo)-linked
polypeptides of similar length as the p53HER-2 fragment are present. Similarly, high amounts of poly{ubiquitin(n )}-linked proteins are present in RIBO-13-Tx
(Supplementary Fig. S1A ). The ubiquitin-specific mAb P4D1 was used for detection. Taxol induced association of higher amounts of Gp96 (D ) and the ribosomal
cochaperone Mpp-11J (E ) with RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO-17-Tx than with RIBO-16 and RIBO-17.

Figure 3. Polysomes are more efficient activators of proliferation and differentiation of E75-TCR+ cells than peptides and mRNA. A, RIBO-17-Tx expanded more
E75-TCRmed+lo Perforin+ cells than RIBO-17 did. PBMC-2 stimulated with RIBO-17-Tx and RIBO-17 were stained and quantified as described in Materials and Methods.
The amount of total protein bound to each RIBO fraction is shown in Supplementary Table S1B . RIBO-13 and RIBO-13-Tx were weaker activators of E75-TCR+ cells

E75-TCR+ cells than non–RNaseA-treated RNC-III. Donor-3 PBMC were stimulated with 1,000 ng of total RNA from non–RNaseA-treated RNC-III (D), RNC-III treated
with RNaseA (E), non–RNaseA-treated control 2774 cell polysomes (5), control 2774 cell polysomes treated with RNaseA (n), 5 Ag/mL free peptide E75 (.), or
remained unactivated (o). ‘‘Control’’ indicates that polysomes were from 2,774 cells, which express low levels of HER-2. Seven days after activation, E75-TCR+ cells
were present in all cultures. With the exception of E75-TCR+ cells activated by RNaseA-treated polysomes, most E75-TCR+ cells decayed on day 16. E75-TCR+
cell numbers activated by RNaseA-treated RNC-III versus E75-TCR+ cells activated by non–RNaseA-treated RNC-III (P < 0.05, >2.5 times increase). C, SKOV-3
polysomes (Polysomes ) are more efficient activators of CTL, which lysed the HLA-A2–matched SKOV-3.A2 cells than control, unstimulated CTL plus IL-12, and CTL
activated by free peptide E75 (at 5 Ag/mL) plus IL-12 (E75 ). Columns, results of a 4-h CTL 51Cr-release assay (% specific lysis by polysomes and E75-activated CTL
versus NP; P < 0.05, >2.5 times increase) are from one of two representative experiments done in triplicate. D, SKOV-3 polysomes (E) are more effective activators
of CTL than isolated mRNA from the same SK-OV-3 (n). Nonadherent Donor-3 PBMC were activated with autologous iDC pulsed with equal amounts (1,000 ng)
of RNA from polysomes and isolated mRNA from SK-OV-3. Equal numbers of CD8+ cells activated by polysomes and mRNA were used as effectors in a 4-h CTL assay
(% specific lysis; polysome-activated versus mRNA-activated; P < 0.03, more than thrice the increase). Points, results from one experiment done in triplicate.

polypeptides exiting the ribosomal tunnel and recruits the
multifunctional Hsc-70 (20), was present in RIBO-16-Tx and RIBO17-Tx but was undetectable in RIBO-16 and RIBO-17 (Fig. 2E).
Therefore, treatment with Taxol increased the amount of large
polysomal complexes by linking together more ribosomes, ubiquitin(n )-linked proteins, Gp96, and Mpp-11J. The amount of RNA in
the RIBO-17-Tx fraction quadrupled and the amount of bound
proteins more than tripled compared with the RIBO-17 fraction of
equivalent size from untreated SK-OV-3.
RIBO-17-Tx expanded more E75-TCR+ CD8+ cells than RIBO17 did. To characterize the activation of CD8+ cells by ISMMC,
PBMC were stimulated with (a) RIBO-17, which contained more
p53HER-2 and p91HER-2 than cHER-2 and few ubiquitin(n)conjugated proteins and (b) RIBO-17-Tx, which contained amounts

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

of p53HER-2 and p91HER-2 similar to those of RIBO-17 but
substantially more ubiquitin(n)-linked proteins than RIBO-17. The
total amount of RNA-bound proteins is shown in Supplementary
Tables S2 and S4.
One hundred six nanograms of RIBO-17-Tx total proteins
expanded and differentiated more CD8+ E75-TCR+ Perforin+ cells
than 165 ng of RIBO-17 total protein did (Fig. 3A). The increase
in Perforin+ cells was 1.7 times greater for TCRmed and TCRlo cells
than for TCRhi cells. At these amounts of protein, RIBO-17-Tx
contained four times less total RNA than RIBO-17 did. In another
experiment with cells from another donor, RIBO-17-Tx expanded
twice to thrice more E75-TCR+ cells than RIBO-17 did (Supplementary Table S3A). RIBO-17-Tx also activated more CD56+
IFN-g+ NKG2D+ than E75 and RIBO-17 (Supplementary Table S3B).

RIBO-13 and RIBO-13-Tx were much weaker activators of E75TCR+ cells (data not shown). Because Taxol increased the
amount of protein and RNA in ISMMC by a factor of 4, Taxolinduced ISMMC can differentiate at least six times (1.5  4)
more antigen -specific cells than native ISMMC can and expand
eight times more Perforin antigen-specific CD8+ cells than
native ISMMC can.
Ribosomes generated by RNaseA digestion expanded more
E75-TCR+ cells than polysomes did. To identify how ISMMC
activate CD8+ cells, we separated the large peak (RIBO-13 to RIBO18) into two peaks by longer (6 h) sucrose-gradient centrifugation
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). The corresponding ISMMC were
designated RNC-I, RNC-II, RNC-III, and RNC-IV. RNC-III included
RIBO-13, and RNC-IV included RIBO-17.
To determine whether mRNA-linked polysomes were sufficient
for activating CD8+ cells, we treated RNC-III with RNaseA. The
specificity of mammalian RNaseA is close to the that of human
RNaseA. RNaseA preferentially digests single-stranded RNA (i.e.,
mRNA and tRNA) but has modest activity for double-stranded (i.e.,
ribosomal) RNA. Treating RNC-III with RNaseA enhanced its ability
to expand Donor-3 CD8+ cells by a factor of 5.4 compared with
RNC-III untreated with RNaseA (Fig. 3B, day 16).
RNaseA-treated RNC-III expanded four times more E75-TCR+
cells than the free peptide E75 + IL-12 did. RNC-III polysomes
untreated with RNaseA only transiently expanded E75-TCR+ cells
(Fig. 3B, day 7).
To confirm that CD8+ cells activated by polysomes expanded
more effectors than peptide E75 did, we measured lysis of SK-OV-

3.A2 by PBMC-3 activated by peptide E75 and polysomes (Fig. 3C).
At the same number of CD8+ cell effectors, lysis by polysomeactivated effectors was 60% higher than that by peptide E75 + IL12–activated effectors. Five micrograms of E75 corresponded to
900 Ag of complete HER-2 protein. The amount of total proteins,
including HER-2 bound to 1 Ag RNA, did not exceed 4 Ag. Assuming
that 10% of cHER-2 is from total polysomal bound protein, then
polysomes were 20 times more effective than free peptide E75 in
activating CD8+ cells.
To determine whether mRNA could replace ISMMC for
activation of CD8+ cells, PBMC-3 were activated by polysomes
and mRNA isolated from the same SK-OV-3. ISMMC were 2.5 times
more effective in activating tumor cell lytic CD8+ cells than purified
mRNA was (Fig. 3D). Therefore, polysomes were more effective
activators of cytolytic CD8+ cells than mRNA was.
The most efficient activators of E75-TCRhi IFN-;+ cells are
present in RNC-IV. Native and Taxol-induced ISMMC were more
effective than peptide E75 in expanding lytic CD8+ cells. This finding
raised the hypothesis that the ISMMC-linked pCE is in a form
that favors its processing and E75 presentation. Taxol-induced
ISMMC were only slightly better activators of perforin than native
ISMMC. Expression of IFN-g precedes expression of perforin in CD8+
cells. TCR-induced death of IFN-g+ cells also eliminates CD8+ cells
expressing IFN-g and perforin (14). To identify the pCE of E75, we
analyzed the possible relationship between the cHER-2 and HER-2
polypeptides and the immunogenicity of native ISMMC.
The amount of cHER-2 decreased from RNC-I to RNC-IV,
indicating, as expected, that less cHER-2 was synthesized on heavy

Figure 4. RNC-III and RNC-IV are more
efficient activators of E75-TCR+ cells
than RNC-I and express p53HER-2 and
p91HER-2 but lower amounts of cHER-2.
A, the ubiquitin(n )-linked RNC concentrate

RNC-IV. The y axis shows the absolute

more effectively than RNC-I, RNC-II, and
RNC-III do. Representative histograms
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.
D, ribosome nascent chains of HER-2 on
RNC-III and RNC-IV. Pooled sucrosegradient fractions 11 to 13 (RNC-III) and 16

were precipitated with ethanol and
separated by SDS-PAGE. HER-2
polypeptides transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes were detected with mAb-19
(Ab-19 ) and the ubiquitin-linked proteins,
with P4D1 (P4D1 ). The amounts of
p91HER-2, p53HER-2, and ubiquitin(oligo)linked p53HER-2 were determined using
the Image analyzer program J1.34, version
1.61, available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/

than on light polysomes (not shown). The amount of ubiquitin(n )linked proteins peaked in the ribosomal fraction 8, which was part
of RNC-II, and decreased in RNC-III and RNC-IV (Fig. 4A).
We primed PBMC-3 with the proteins bound to equal amounts of
RNA (as a constant APC activator) from all four ISMMC: RNC-I,
RNC-II, RNC-III, and RNC-IV. RNC-III contained the most efficient
pCE for activation and proliferation of CD8+ cells specific for
multiple ribosomal-bound TA. CD8+ cells activated by RNC-III
expanded by more than thrice compared with CD8+ cells activated
by RNC-I (Fig. 4B). At equal amounts of total RNA, the total amount
of proteins in RNC-III was 2.7, 1.4, and 1.3 times lower than that in
RNC-I, RNC-II, and RNC-IV, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).
We then quantified E75-TCR+ cells expanded by the four
ISMMC listed above. To increase the sensitivity of detection, we
measured cells expressing IFN-g. There were 4.0 and 5.5 times
more E75-TCRhi CD8+ IFN-g+ cells in RNC-II-activated and RNCIV-activated PBMC-3 than in non–RNC-activated and RNC-I–
activated PBMC-3 (Fig. 4C). Because twice less RNC-II and RNC-IV
proteins than RNC-I proteins were used for activation, we
concluded that RNC-IV was the most efficient immunogen for
E75-TCRhi CD8+ IFN-g+ cells.
We noted that RNC-III contained six HER-2 fragments longer
than p91HER-2. Ubiquitin-linked P4D1-reactive proteins of the
same length were not detected. RNC-III and RNC-IV contained
similar amounts of p91HER-2 and p53HER-2. Both RNC-III and
RNC-IV contained ubiquitin(n )-linked proteins (Fig. 4D, top of the
gel). p53HER-2 was oligoubiquitin linked, but p91HER-2 was not
ubiquitin linked.
To contain both E75 (amino acids 369–377) and the mAb-19recognized epitope (amino acids 377–394), p53HER-2 should consist
of a 45-kDa HER-2 polypeptide linked to one, but not to two,
ubiquitin monomer. If we subtract the ubiquitin mass (8,000 Da)
from the total mass of p53HER-2 (53,000 Da), the result is a 45,000-Da
HER-2 fragment. If we divide the mass of this fragment by the
average mass of amino acid in HER-2 (108.99), the result is a

413–amino acid long chain. If p53HER-2 is linked to two ubiquitin
molecules, the HER-2 fragment should be 340 amino acids long. A
340–amino acid long polypeptide will lack both the E75 sequence
and the mAb-19 recognition site.
Ubiquitin-linked p53HER-2 is likely to be the most efficient
pCE in ISMMC for activation of E75-TCRmed+hi CD8+ IFN-;+
cells. To identify the most probable pCE of E75, we compared
expansion of CD8+ cells by proteins bound to equal amounts of
RNA from RNC-III and RNC-IV. The large CD8+ E75-TCRmed+hi
IFN-g+ cells increased by 2.7 times after activation with RNC-IV
compared with RNC-III (Fig. 5A and B). The amount of p53HER-2
in RNC-IV was only 1.5 times higher than that present in RNC-III
(Fig. 4D).
Because E75 constitutes 2.2% and 1.1% of p53HER-2/p45HER-2
and p91HER-2, respectively, our results suggested an additional
source of E75 precursor, likely in ubiquitin(n )–HER-2. However,
mAb-19 cannot distinguish between ubiquitin(n )-p91 and ubiquitin(n)–p53HER-2. To identify polyubiquitinated HER-2 peptides,
we treated RNC-III and RNC-IV with the deubiquitinating enzyme
Iso-T. Iso-T cleaves multiubiquitin and branched ubiquitin chains,
leaving ubiquitin monomers intact (9). After digestion with Iso-T,
the ratio p53HER-2 (RNC-IV/RNC-III) and p91HER-2 (RNC-IV/
RNC-III) increased similarly (by 1.36 and 1.54 times, respectively),
indicating that only part of both p53HER-2 and p91HER-2 was
polyubiquitinated. However, the overall increase of p53HER-2 in
RNC-IV compared with RNC-III was 2.48 times, whereas that of
p91HER-2 was only 1.6 times.
Three longer HER-2 polypeptides were detected by mAb-19 after
Iso-T digestion (Fig. 5C). p103HER-2 was present in equal amounts
in RNC-III and RNC-IV. E75 is 1% of p103HER-2. The amount of
p138HER-2 was twice higher in RNC-III than in RNC-IV. E75 is
0.73% of p138. The amount of p155HER-2 was five times higher in
RNC-III than in RNC-IV. E75 is 0.64% of p155. It is unlikely that any
of them constituted pCE for E75 because RNC-IV induced more
E75-TCR+ cells than RNC-III did. Furthermore, the overall amount

cells activated with RNC-III. *Significantly higher numbers of E75-TCRhi+med were found in RNC-IV–stimulated cells (stimulation index > 2.0; P < 0.05) than in RNC-IIIstimulated cells. C, RNC-IV contains higher amounts of p91 and p53HER-2, whereas RNC-III contains higher amounts of ubiquitin(n)-linked HER-2 fragments
of 103, 138, and 155 kDa. RNC-III and RNC-IV were digested with Iso-T in the same experiment. HER-2 polypeptides in the Iso-T lysates were detected with
mAb-19 and quantified by scanning densitometry. Iso-T digestion compared with no digestion shows (a) increase in p91HER-2 in RNC-IV after iso-T digestion and (b )
decrease in p138 and p155 in RNC-IV compared with RNC-III. The total relative amount of E75, calculated as percentage of absorbance, was 74.7 (13.18 + 16.45 +
17.02 + 24.1 + 3.98) in RNC-III, whereas it was 79.1 (3.05 + 9.99 + 17.29 + 38.92 + 9.85) in RNC-IV.

Figure 6. RIBO-17 and RIBO-17-Tx are internalized by CD91-mediated endocytosis and preprocessed in endolysosomes. A, iDCs were pretreated with
cytochalasin-D and pulsed with RIBO-17-Tx. Nonadherent autologous PBMC-4 were used as responders. Responses are shown using TCRhi cells as indicators, which
are sensitive to low amounts of antigen. The stimulation index was calculated by dividing the number of E75-TCR+ cells present after stimulation by the number of
E75-TCR+ cells present in control cultures; NS, not significant. B, the effects of inhibition of endocytosis of ISMMC on T-cell activation are shown for TCRmed cells,
which need more antigen for activation than TCRhi cells do. APC were incubated with CD91-specific and Lox-1–specific mAb followed by human IgG to block Fc
receptors. Cells were incubated with dansyl-cadaverine (DC ) at 25 Ag/105 iDC for the duration of RIBO stimulation (3 h), as described in ref. 13. C, lysosomal proteasedependent presentation of E75 from RIBO-17-Tx indicates that differences in the molecular composition of RIBO-17 and RIBO-17-Tx affect E75 presentation.
E75-TCRhi+med+lo cells from Donor 4 were used as responders. Autologous APC were pretreated with inhibitors (as described in ref. 18), with no stimulation (5),
E75 ( ), RIBO-17 ( ), RIBO-17 + chloroquine ( ), RIBO-17-Tx (n), or RIBO-17-Tx + chloroquine ( ). Chloroquine was used at the concentration of 25 Ag/mL, E75 was
used at 5 Ag/mL, and RIBO-17 and RIBO-17-Tx were used at 500 ng/105 iDC. Chloroquine inhibition of processing is shown for all E75-TCR+ populations. The inhibitors
remained in culture for the entire duration of RIBO-17 and RIBO-17-Tx stimulation (3 h). Cell numbers were determined 7 d after activation. All results are from
the gated large, blast-size, population.

of E75 in precursor peptides together (RNC-III, 74.8 relative
absorbance; RNC-IV, 79.1 relative absorbance) was similar.
The 2.7 times stronger immunogenicity of RNC-IV paralleled the
increase in the ratio of the amount of p53 in RNC-IV compared
with that in RNC-III (2.48). The parallel suggests that p53HER-2
was the major pCE of E75. This finding is supported by the
doubling of E75-TCR+ cells on stimulation with RIBO-17-Tx and the
2-fold to 3-fold increase of p53HER-2 in RIBO-17-Tx compared with
RIBO-17 (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
RIBO-17-Tx, but not RIBO-17, is protected from terminal
proteolytic degradation in vacuoles. To identify the pathway of
ISMMC uptake and HLA class I–associated processing of ISMMC
to E75, APC were treated with cytochalasin-D (a phagocytosis
inhibitor), with CD91 and Lox-1 (blocking antibodies to the
scavenger receptors), and with dansyl-cadaverine (Dan-C, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis; ref. 11). Cytochalasin-D
did not inhibit but rather increased the uptake of immunogenic
precursor of E75 by APC because more E75-TCR+ cells expanded in
its presence than in its absence (Fig. 6A). Blocking CD91 inhibited
proliferation of indicator E75-TCRmed cells more than blocking of
Lox-1 did (Fig. 6B).
To determine whether E75 was generated by proteasomal or
nonproteasomal proteases, an E75 peptide–activated T-cell line
was reactivated with APC pulsed with RNC-III in the presence and
absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the cysteineprotease inhibitor E64. E64 is also a generic inhibitor of calpains
and cathepsins G, D, L, and H. Treatment of APC with 10 Ag of E64
increased by seven times the number of E75-TCRhi+med+lo cells
activated by pCE from RNC-III compared with the unstimulated E75-TCRhi cells. MG132 inhibited proliferation in response to
RNC-III (Supplementary Table S5). This finding confirmed that a
substantial part of ISMMC is terminally degraded by cysteine
proteases and is unavailable for processing to peptide by
proteasome.
In the absence of chloroquine, RIBO-17-Tx was a 50% more
efficient activator of TCRmed and TCRlo cells than RIBO-17. TCRmed

and TCRlo cells need more TA for activation because they express
less TCR than TCRhi cells. Chloroquine inhibited by 40% to 50% the
proliferation of all indicator E75-TCR+ populations in response
RIBO-17-Tx but enhanced by 30% the proliferation of E75TCRmed+lo cells activated by RIBO-17 (Fig. 6C). Therefore, the
pCE of E75 in RIBO-17-Tx, but not that in RIBO-17, was protected
from terminal degradation in vacuoles.
Protection of RIBO-17-Tx from terminal proteolysis may be due
to exhaustion of proteases during degradation of adducts by Taxol
to ISMMC. Additional studies are needed to address whether the
adducts brought by Taxol to ISMMC enhance the efficacy of TA
processing and presentation.

Discussion
In ovarian tumor cells, we identified ISMMC that activated
proliferation and partial differentiation of HER-2–specific CD8+
cells. Activation of proliferation by ISMMC did not require
exogenous inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. ISMMC
contained nascent TA/HER-2 polypeptide chains bound to
synthesizing mRNA on ribosomes and linked to ubiquitin. The
shortest and apparently most efficient pCE–HER-2 consisted of
ubiquitin–45-kDa HER-2 (1–413) polypeptide. ISSMC were chaperoned by Gp96. Taxol-induced ISMMC contained the cochaperone
Mpp-11J, which attracts Hsp70 to the ribosome.
Taxol-induced ISMMC were more efficient activators of E75TCR+ cells than ISMMC in donors tested. Because Taxol quadrupled
the amount of ISMMC relative to that in untreated SK-OV-3, we
concluded that overall, Taxol-modified ISMMC can activate more
T cells of various specificities than native ISMMC can.
ISMMC endowed with CD8 cell activation and differentiation
capacity have not been described in cancer or healthy cells.
Activation of cellular immunity after phagocytosis of a molecular
complex containing foreign antigen has been postulated to explain
the signal that activated APC and the source of endogenous
cytokines (21, 22). Our findings are supported by activation of

B-cell autoimmunity by self–small nRNAs–nuclear proteins complexes (23, 24).
The self-mRNA sequence is considered an inefficient activator of
IL-12 (25). Our RNC, tumor cells, and media were free of endotoxins,
Mycoplasma, and bacteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that bacterial or
viral RNA was introduced into the ISMMC. The IL-12–activating
self-RNA originated from two possible sources: (a) the shortened
poly-(A) chains of mRNA and (b) the longer HER-2 transcripts that
contain the 3¶-untranslated region (UTR) of HER-2 mRNA.
Termination of translation is followed by activation of poly-(A)–
specific 3¶-exoRNase, which mediates deadenylation of mRNA to
15 to 30 residue-long poly-(A) tails (26). The short poly-(A) chains
activate TLRs (26). Transcription of 3¶-UTR–HER-2 and enrichment
of an 8-kb HER-2 transcript in SK-OV-3 (27–29) result in nucleotide
chains of unique sequence. Such chains can activate TLRs or
cytosolic RNA receptors in APC because they are seen as foreign
RNA (30). However, heat shock proteins bound to RNAs can act as
coactivators of RNA receptors by presenting some and masking
other RNA sequences similar with tumor and viral peptides bound
on peptidoglycans, which increase IL-6 production from iDC.10
Our findings suggest that TA from ISMMC is delivered to
endosomes and reach the cytoplasm for proteasomal processing.
This retrotranslocation pathway consists of transport of pCE
through the route lysosomes ! endosomes ! ER ! cytoplasm.
The traffic of RNA-bound pCE from endosomes to the ER is
facilitated by coat proteins, similar to the retrotranslocation of
ricin A and Pseudomonas toxins (31, 32). The exit from the ER to
the cytoplasm is facilitated by the one or two ubiquitin molecules
linked to pCE–HER-2. Our hypothesis is supported by the
immunogenicity of a fusion protein, influenza-neuraminidase-E75.
The fusion protein was longer than expected, suggesting that it was
posttranslationally glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus.11
Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the formation of
immunogenic ISMMC. The ‘‘heavy’’ polysomes (RIBO-17/RIBO-17Tx) are formed when translation stops in one ribosome. Other
ribosomes attach to it, forming a large complex called ‘‘stalled
ribosomes/polysomes’’ (17, 33). Because Iso-T treatment showed
more p91HER-2 on RNC-IV than on RNC-III, the p91HER-2–
synthesizing ribosome may have been stalled first. The small
amounts of p155HER-2, p138HER-2, and p103HER-2 in RNC-IV
relative to those in RNC-III indicate that more ribosomes
synthesized p91HER-2 than p138HER-2 and p155HER-2 at the
time of ‘‘stalling.’’
RNC are transiently ubiquitin conjugated when protein
synthesis is on ‘‘stand-by’’ and are deubiquitinated as synthesis

restarts (34). A part of both p53HER-2 and p91HER-2 was
polyubiquitinated. The ubiquitin-linked RNCs in an energetically
transient state will be directed for cytoplasmic degradation when
the energy of the system decreases or will be deubiquitinated
when the ribosome is rescued (34). Such transient states of RNCs
are easier to detect in stable proteins with long half-lives, such as
HER-2 (t 1/2 = 18 h; ref. 27).
ISMMC form much larger particles than individual ribosomes
but require dissociation by RNaseA to activate T cells. The
accumulated large ISMMC may undergo exocytosis even before
tumor cell apoptosis. Such ISMMC are degraded to ribosomes by
RNase in interstitial fluids or from APC (35, 36). ISMMC induce
IL-12 in iDC and increase the number of CD40+ iDC.12 CD40
expression is associated with activation of CD8+ cells (30, 37). The
pCE in ISMMC differs from the classic ‘‘defective-ribosomal
product.’’ The proteasomal conjugation factor RAD23 is associated
with RNC-I, which contains more cHER-2, and is absent from RNCIII and RNC-IV.13 The presence of RAD23 suggested that in normal
conditions, RNC-I can be degraded with priority by the direct
proteasomal pathway, whereas RNC-III and RNC-IV do not.
However, because ISMMC are taken up by APC and directed to
vacuoles, the direct proteasomal degradation pathway is either not
accessed or, if accessed, the pCE of E75 is not in the optimal form
for E75 peptide processing and presentation.
Taxol induces cellular autoimmunity in patients, such as
scleroderma-like illness without antinuclear antibodies (38–40).
Our findings indicate that quantitatively, Taxol-induced ISMMC
expanded more CD8+ cells than natural ISMMC did. Qualitatively,
stronger expansion by ISMMC was directed to cells expressing less
TCR than cells that highly express TCR. The former need more
peptide–MHC-I complexes than the latter. We do not know yet
whether the amounts of ISMMC used induced TCR-activated death
of TCRhi cells. ISMMC were considerably more efficient activators
than peptides and mRNA. Identification of natural and Taxolinduced ISMMC protected from degradation indicated novel
strategies for generating cancer vaccines with synthetic multimolecular complexes containing optimized components. Such vaccines should be useful after chemotherapy with Taxol in prevention
of metastases.
