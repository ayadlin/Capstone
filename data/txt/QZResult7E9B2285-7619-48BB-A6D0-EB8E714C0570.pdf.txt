Abstract

Introduction

Nearly 30% of women with early-stage breast cancer develop
recurrent disease attributed to resistance to systemic therapy.
Prevailing models of chemotherapy failure describe three
resistant phenotypes: cells with alterations in transmembrane
drug transport, increased detoxification and repair pathways,
and alterations leading to failure of apoptosis. Proliferative
activity correlates with tumor sensitivity. Cell-cycle status, controlling proliferation, depends on local concentration of oxygen
and nutrients. Although physiologic resistance due to diffusion
gradients of these substances and drugs is a recognized
phenomenon, it has been difficult to quantify its role with any
accuracy that can be exploited clinically. We implement a
mathematical model of tumor drug response that hypothesizes
specific functional relationships linking tumor growth and
regression to the underlying phenotype. The model incorporates
the effects of local drug, oxygen, and nutrient concentrations
within the three-dimensional tumor volume, and includes the
experimentally observed resistant phenotypes of individual cells.
We conclude that this integrative method, tightly coupling
computational modeling with biological data, enhances the
value of knowledge gained from current pharmacokinetic
measurements, and, further, that such an approach could
predict resistance based on specific tumor properties and thus
improve treatment outcome. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4484–92]

We implement a novel quantitative approach that links growth and
regression of a tumor mass to the underlying phenotype to study the
effect of drug and nutrient delivery as mediators of physiologic
resistance. It is well known that inefficient vascularization may
prevent optimal transport of oxygen, nutrients, and therapeutics to
cancer cells in solid tumors (1). As a result, the drug agent must diffuse
through the tumor volume to reach the entire tumor cell population,
and there is mounting evidence to indicate that these diffusion
gradients may significantly limit drug access (2–5). Both hypoxia and
hypoglycemia contribute to physiologic resistance through various
mechanisms, including induction of oxidative stress and a decrease in
the number of proliferating cells (6–12). The myriad of stresses can
lead to selection of cells that resist apoptotic conditions, thus adding
to pathologic resistance in tumors (13). This evidence strongly
suggests that the diffusion process alone can lead to the evolution of
drug resistance in tumor cells that exceeds predictions based on
individual cell phenotype (5). It has not been easy to quantify the
resistance effects of diffusion gradients with any accuracy that can be
exploited in a clinical setting. The different physical scales in a tumor
spanning from the nanometer to the centimeter scale present a
complex system that, to be better understood, could benefit from
appropriate mathematical models and computer simulations in
addition to laboratory and clinical observations.
In particular, biocomputational modeling of tumor drug response
has endeavored in the last two decades to address this need. Space
limitations preclude a full description (see refs. 5, 14, 15, references
therein). Doxorubicin cellular pharmacodynamics has been modeled; for example, ref. 16 presented a model providing good fits to
in vitro cytotoxicity data. Drug transport was modeled in spheroids
versus monolayers (17). A model capable of predicting intracellular
doxorubicin accumulation that matched experimental observations
was described in ref. 18. Different drug kinetic effects in vitro were
compared in ref. 19, showing that a single drug infusion could be
more effective than repeated short applications. Models using
multiscale approaches [i.e., linking events at subcellular, cellular,
and tumor scales (e.g., ref. 20); studying vascularized tumor
treatment (e.g., ref. 21); and simulating nanoparticle effects (e.g.,
ref. 3)] have also been developed. Existing mathematical models are
often limited to radially symmetrical tumor representations and not
fully constrained through experimentally set parameters.
Here, we use a multiscale computational model, extending a
previous formulation of tumor growth founded in cancer biology

Major Findings
By extracting mathematical model parameter values
for drug and nutrient delivery from monolayer (onedimensional) experiments and using the functional
relationships to compute drug delivery in MCF-7
spheroid (three-dimensional) experiments, we use the
model to quantify the diffusion barrier effect, which alone
can result in poor response to chemotherapy both from
diminished drug delivery and from lack of nutrients
required to maintain proliferative conditions.

Prediction of Drug Response Using Integrative Modeling

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Equation 1:

@$V =@t þ r  ðuV $V Þ ¼ Mr  ð$V ðdE=d$V ÞÞ þ SV
@$D =@t þ r  ðuD $D Þ ¼ Mr  ð$D ðdE=d$D ÞÞ þ SD

The three-dimensional in vitro environment is modeled as a mixture of viable tumor tissue (volume fraction
$ V), dead tumor tissue ($ D), and interstitial fluid [$ W, given indirectly by 1  ($ V + $ D) and assumed to move
freely] flowing through the ECM, which we treat as a porous medium. These partial differential equations are
derived from the conservation of mass of these quantities (22, 23). From left to right in each equation, the terms
represent change of volume fraction with respect to time; tissue advection (bulk transport) by the overall
mixture as it moves with local velocity u; net tissue diffusion due to the balance of mechanical forces, including
cell-cell adhesion (related to mobility constant M; refs. 22, 23) and cell-cell adhesion and repulsion (oncotic
pressure), modeled using the variational derivative of the adhesion energy E ( for specific forms of this energy, see
ref. 22); and net source of tissue due to the balance of mitosis, apoptosis, and necrosis.
In Words: The temporal rate of change in viable and dead tumor tissue at any location within the tumor
equals the amount of mass that is pushed, transported, and pulled due to cell motion, adhesion, and tissue
pressure, plus the net result of production and destruction of mass due to cell proliferation and death.

Major Assumptions of the Model
The tumor is a mixture of cells, interstitial fluid, and ECM, and we treat the motion of interstitial fluid
and cells through the ECM as fluid flow in a porous medium. Therefore, no distinction between interstitial
fluid hydrostatic pressure and mechanical pressure due to cell-cell interactions is made. Cell velocity is a
function of cell mobility and tissue oncotic (solid) pressure (Darcy’s law); cell-cell adhesion is modeled
using an energy approach from continuum thermodynamics (22).

Equation 2:

SV ¼ ðkM ðr; dÞ  kA ðr; dÞ  kN H ½rN  r	Þ$V
SD ¼ ðkA ð; dÞ þ kN H ½rN  r	Þ$V  kL $D

These equations specify net sources S V and S D of mass for viable and dead tumor tissue, respectively. This
directly links the conservation of mass equations, Eq. 1, to the cell phenotype through hypothesized phenomenological functional relationships that include diffusion of cell substrates and drug (of local concentration
r and d, respectively) through tumor interstitium (see ref. 22 and references therein). For the viable tissue ( first
equation), the terms on the right-hand side represent, from left to right, volume fraction gained from cell mitosis
(rate k M) and lost to cell apoptosis (k A) and necrosis (k N). For the dead tissue (second equation), the terms on
the right-hand side represent, from left to right, increase in volume fraction from cell apoptosis and necrosis and
decrease in volume fraction from cell disintegration by lysis (k L). All rates are inverse time.
In Words: Mass of viable tumor tissue increases through cell proliferation and decreases through cell
apoptosis and necrosis. Mass of dead tumor tissue increases through cell apoptosis and necrosis and
decreases through cell lysing. These equations provide a means of incorporating the biology of the problem
into the physical conservation laws in Eq. 1.

Major Assumptions of the Model
Cells are composed entirely of water, which is a reasonable first approximation in terms of volume
fraction (see discussion in ref. 22). Cell mitosis is proportional to substrates present (47). As mitosis occurs,
an appropriate amount of water from the interstitial fluid is converted into cell mass. Substrate depletion
below a level r N leads to necrosis (26, 7). Cell lysis represents a loss of mass as cellular membranes are
degraded and the mass is converted into water that is absorbed into the interstitial fluid. The simulated
interface between viable and necrotic tissue is forced to be of biologically realistic thickness (10–100 Am)
through the Heaviside function H (see refs. 22, 23). Mitosis and apoptosis rates are functions of drug (d)
and substrate (r) concentrations. Note that the assumption that parameters measured for drug sensitivity
in monolayer, modulated by diffusion gradients, can adequately represent response in vivo may not be
correct for real tumors (e.g., it disregards drug resistance from growing with an ECM).

Equation 3: g1 @r=@t ¼ L2 r2 r  r
This is a partial differential equation that describes cell substrate concentration r across the tumor
viable region. The first term on the right-hand side models diffusion of the substrates into the tumor
spheroid with penetration length L. The second term models substrate uptake by the cells (with rate g). An
analogous equation is posed for drug concentration d.

(22–25), to enable more rigorous
quantification of diffusion effects
on tumor drug response. This
model can represent nonsymmetrical solid tumor morphologies
three-dimensionally, thus providing the capability to capture the
physical complexity and heterogeneity of the cancer microenvironment. More significantly, we
fully constrain the model through
functional relationships with
parameters set from experiments.
We hypothesize the simplest relationships that would at the same
time be biologically founded and
which could be calibrated by the
experimental data. These relationships link tumor mass growth and
regression to the underlying phenotype. They provide the mathematical basis for describing cell
mitosis, apoptosis, and necrosis
modulated by diffusion gradients
of oxygen, nutrients, and cytotoxic
drugs, and enable quantification
of the physiologic resistance introduced by these gradients. Input
parameters include the diffusion
coefficients for these substances
and the rate constants for proliferation, apoptosis, and necrosis.
We measure parameter values
from independent experiments
done under conditions with no
gradients (i.e., with cells grown as
one-dimensional monolayers) and
then use these values to calculate
cell survival in three-dimensional
tumor geometry. These values
are compared with experiments
in which cells are grown as in vitro
tumor spheroids, representing a
three-dimensional tumor environment with diffusion gradients.
This approach allows us (a) to
fully constrain the computational
model, using experimentally
obtained parameter values, and
(b) to validate the hypothesized
functional relationships by comparing the computed threedimensional tumor viability with
the spheroid tumor growth
experiments. By quantifying the
link between tumor growth and
regression and the underlying
phenotype, the work presented
here provides a quantitative tool
to study tumor drug response and
treatment.

consistent with in vitro doxorubicin penetration into Chinese hamster lung
cell spheroids at 24 h (43) reporting an average 2/3 drop of external
concentration across the viable region. Other studies have shown doxorubicin
penetration in vivo (mouse model) decreasing by half within 40 to 50 Am of
blood vessels by 3 h (4), as well as penetration in humans (biopsies)
decreasing by half within 50 Am of blood vessels after 2 h of a bolus and within
60 to 80 Am after 24 h in breast cancer tissue (2). By fitting the solution of the
unsteady Eq. 3 to these data, we could indirectly estimate average cellular
uptake rates g of doxorubicin by breast cancer cells in three-dimensional
tissue of f1 day1, consistent with the independent penetration length
estimate L = (D/g)1/2 from the steady-state profiles.
The rate k M (inverse time) measures the change in cell number in a
population due to mitosis, normalized by total cell number (control = cells
with no drug), and thus was calibrated by matching proliferation data from
our experiments, using as initial guess for k M/k M,C, the in vitro cell
proliferation as fraction of control divided by in vitro cell viability (total
number of cells N in monolayer) as fraction of control, yielding an estimate
of cell proliferation f1 day1.

Cytotoxicity of MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin may be affected more by glucose

calibrated from previous observations (12) showing an average MCF-7
viability increase 2.2 to 4 times for glucose deprivation of up to 50% at drug
concentrations similar to our study (i.e., 2.2 V 1 + a/2 V 4.0). In our
experiments, glucose concentration in the medium was r 1 = 2.0 g/L. Note
that for r = r 1, the above formula gives k A00 = 0 and thus k A00 = k A¶.
Necrosis parameters for diffusion-limited growth k N (rate of necrosis)
and r N (substrate limit for cell viability) were calibrated by matching
simulation results to in vitro spheroid growth curves and histologic data
under conditions with no drug, as described previously (45), so that the
simulated spheroid radius and viable region thickness matched in vitro
observations. These parameters are directly responsible for the steady
spheroid size (and extent of necrosis) after a growth period because they
regulate the balance of mass growth due to cell proliferation in the viable
region and mass loss due to cell disintegration in the necrotic center (45).
Based on our in vitro measurements of spheroid and necrotic volumes, we
found a stationary average spheroid radius of f0.8 mm, with viable region
of thickness f0.1 mm (see also ref. 46). The latter is consistent with the
estimated cell substrate penetration length L calculated above. The model
calibration based on these quantities consistently yielded k N/k N = 0.7 and
r N/r 1 = 0.5.
Higher cell densities were observed for resistant spheroids, which had a
more compact morphology (27). Based on these observations, higher cell
adhesion parameter values (22) were used in the model equations to
simulate resistant spheroids than for sensitive ones. We used a recently
presented calibration procedure (45) to determine the relative values for
sensitive and resistant cell cultures. This observation and the resulting
different parameters for the two cell phenotypes underscore the need to
explicitly model cell adhesion forces when constructing models of cancer
growth.

Results
The hypothesized functional relationships of the computational
model link growth and regression of the tumor mass to the
underlying phenotype as described in Eqs. 1–3 (Quick Guide). The
model is fully constrained (Materials and Methods) through
experimentally based parameters (Fig. 1). To quantify physiologic
resistance in three-dimensional tumor tissue, diffusion gradients

are incorporated in the functional relationships and the model is
calibrated to compute these gradients. Accordingly, immunohistochemical measurements were done on drug-sensitive tumor
spheroids cultured in vitro (Fig. 2) to confirm that in our experiments (a) cell substrate concentration decreases across the
radius of the spheroid, (b) apoptosis correlates with hypoxia, and
(c) proliferation correlates with substrate availability (43, 47).
Increasing positivity for pimonidazole protein adducts across the
viable rim (f100 Am) in the direction of the spheroid center indicates a gradient of oxygen. Across the viable region, up-regulation
of Na+/H+ transporters detected by increasing positivity for NHE-1
is observed, showing a gradient of pH. Na+/H+ transporters are upregulated in response to acidosis. Up-regulation of GLUT-1
transporters (adaptation to hypoxic/hypoglycemic stress) is shown
in the increasing positivity for GLUT-1 (48) in perinecrotic regions,
indicating gradients of glucose and oxygen. The frequency of
apoptotic cells increases toward the center as shown by increasing
positivity of terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. End-stage apoptotic
bodies are concentrated at the perinecrotic necrotic regions, with
most cells in the center being apoptotic or necrotic. Cell proliferation is limited to the viable rim, as shown by Ki-67 nuclear staining.
According to the computational model, the solution of the
reaction-diffusion, Eq. 3, yields substrate gradients (Fig. 3A) developing across a viable region of width f0.1 mm. The computed
width of this region is consistent with previous observations by
other investigators (e.g., ref. 26). Both glucose and oxygen substrate
concentrations were calculated in the model to drop by at least
50% across the spheroid viable region, with an average concentration hr/r 1i  0.7 in the living tumor tissue. This is in agreement
with measurements of glucose (41) and oxygen (e.g., ref. 42) in
spheroid viable regions from previously reported in vitro measurements (Materials and Methods).
Similarly, the model computes the drug gradients that develop
within the viable tumor spheroid tissue. The calculated drug
concentration profile reaches steady state in f24 hours and decays
by 2/3 across the viable region to yield an average drug
concentration of 50% that of outside the spheroid (Fig. 3B). Note
that the drug penetration length is comparable to the penetration

length of substrates (Fig. 2). Because doxorubicin is a cell cycle–
specific drug and the proportion of cells that are cycling correlates
with the substrate availability, the drug would be less effective as
the proportion of cycling cells is diminished. Not only is its concentration decreased by the diffusion barrier but also its efficacy is
impaired as a result of the substrate gradients. The physiologic
resistance predicted by the model based on the hypothesized
functional relationships would, in principle, apply to any cell cycle–
specific drug.

monolayers was lower by at least 50% for both cell lines at drug concentrations d > 64 nmol/L representing clinically relevant dosages14
(Fig. 4A). Further, increased viability for drug-sensitive cells in three
dimensions corresponded with f50% lower cell metabolic activity
(ratio of metabolic-to-viability counts) in vitro (data not shown).
These data indicate that cell quiescence was significant at drug
dosages similar to in vivo conditions. The cell apoptosis parameter of
the computational model calculated from the monolayer cell
viability data increases with drug concentration (Fig. 4B).
The functional relationships of the computational model (Eqs.
1–3) linking growth and regression of the tumor mass to the
underlying phenotype are validated by quantifying the physiologic
resistance introduced by the diffusion gradients. Cell viabilities
predicted by the model agree well with the ones observed experimentally in three-dimensional spheroids (Fig. 5). In contrast,
monolayer cell viability data are a poor prognosticator of drug
resistance in three-dimensional tumors. An average survival
increase (as fraction of control) of 250% over monolayer was
predicted for drug-sensitive (MCF-7 WT) spheroids under various
drug concentrations (Fig. 5A), whereas for drug-resistant (MCF-7
40F) spheroids, the corresponding increase was 280% (Fig. 5B).
The median dose15 for MCF-7 40F was f20% higher in spheroid
versus monolayer than for MCF-WT, implying not only that the

Prediction of Drug Response Using Integrative Modeling

various times: bottom curve, 2 h; middle curve, 24 h; topmost curve, steady-state, showing f2/3 drop from the tumor edge to the perinecrotic region.

three-dimensional morphology promoted the net survival for both
cell types but also that the resistant phenotype was further favored
by the three-dimensional configuration.
We noted that drug-resistant spheroids maintained more
compact, nearly spherical shapes (Fig. 6A) that simply decreased
in size as cells were killed, whereas drug-sensitive spheroids
formed irregular, looser shapes (Fig. 6B ) that fragmented,
particularly at higher drug concentrations. The tumor morphology
may depend on the competition between heterogeneous cell
proliferation caused by diffusion gradients of cell substrates,
driving shape instability, and stabilizing mechanical forces such as
cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, as we quantitatively showed in
previous work (45). Here, we observe a similar instability for drugsensitive cells, indicating that their adhesion is below the threshold

necessary to maintain tumor shape stability. This is confirmed
through the computational model, where variation in the
parameter values for cell adhesion (22) reproduces these morphologies (Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion
We have used an integrative method that tightly couples
computational modeling with biological data to quantify physiologic resistance in three-dimensional tumor tissue in vitro. The
model hypothesizes functional relationships that mechanistically
link the growth and regression of a tumor mass to the underlying
phenotype. These relationships incorporate the complex interplay
between tumor growth, cell phenotype, and diffusion gradients,

caused by heterogeneous delivery of oxygen and cell substrates and
removal of metabolites, and are thus able to calculate tumor drug
response as a predictable process dependent on biophysical laws.
The results underscore the importance of a quantitative approach
in evaluating chemotherapeutic agents that takes into consideration diffusion in addition to such chemoprotective effects as cell
phenotypic properties and cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix
(ECM) adhesion (49). Although the model was calibrated with in
vitro data for breast cancer, this approach may also apply to drug
response of other tissues.
By modeling transport of drug and cell substrates, this work
creates a quantitative tool that could in the future be used to

predict resistance in patients based on their tumor cell properties,
thus improving treatment outcome. In particular, the proposed
functional relationships help to quantify resistance in human
breast cancer due to local cell substrate depletion. Our integrative
experimental/computational approach provides insight into the
physical dynamics of solid tumors and validates the hypothesized
functional relationships as adequate to describe the observed
phenomena. Although more complex functional forms could
conceivably also provide a reasonable match between model and
experimental results, quantifying the diffusion effect with a
minimal mathematical description is the preferred approach,
unless it is known to be wrong, as it facilitates insight into the
system and provides for more economical simulations. We
explicitly chose not to use complex relationships that would
contain more parameters than the number of independent
measurements available for calibration, thus resulting in an
underdetermined problem.
Cell packing density affects the magnitude of diffusion gradients
and may pose a barrier to effective drug penetration (27). This
density can vary between cell lines and tumors and reflect
variations in drug resistance (compare Fig. 6). How this relates to
cell adhesion molecule expression (e.g., integrin and E-cadherin) is
unclear. Mechanisms of cell packing may include stronger cell
adhesion forces due to higher E-cadherin expression; this should
also limit proliferation, which does not seem to be the case here for
the drug-resistant cells at lower drug concentrations. Additionally,
cellular stress affects the quantity and strength of cell adhesion
molecules. We have previously investigated the effect of the tumor
microenvironment on tissue morphology (45, 50), suggesting that
marginally stable environmental conditions could directly affect
morphogenesis and present an additional challenge to therapy
(45, 48) in vivo by increasing tumor cell invasiveness and leading to
complex infiltrative morphologies, depending on the magnitude of
cell adhesion forces that tend to maintain compact, noninvasive
tumors (50). Diffusion gradients combined with higher cell packing
density augment drug resistance synergistically, as observed in our
experiments with the higher median dose for the more compact,
drug-resistant spheroids, yet it may be difficult to deterministically
gauge their combined effect (5). Synergism may be due to increased

drug binding to ECM in tumor areas proximal to the drug source,
whereas substrate and drug penetration to distal areas is
significantly reduced due to higher cell packing, thus exacerbating
the resistance effect of the diffusion barrier.
Note that the presumption that the necrotic region is not a risk
factor for progression may not be necessarily true because
selection pressures for resistance and induction of mutation are
strongest in hypoxic, perinecrotic areas. Thus, inducing a large
necrotic fraction during treatment may paradoxically further select
for drug resistance.
The class of prediction modeling presented in this article, based
on an assimilation of complex processes with a fully threedimensional physical environment, offers the capability of complementing current pharmacokinetic measurements. A more
expansive integration of theoretical model parameters with
biological data could help to move toward prediction of treatment
response based on in vitro and in vivo tumor information, and
determine the correspondence between in vitro measurements and
the in vivo condition to refine and validate the assumption that this
approach can describe in vivo tumors. Incorporation of patientspecific tumor phenotypic and microenvironmental parameters
