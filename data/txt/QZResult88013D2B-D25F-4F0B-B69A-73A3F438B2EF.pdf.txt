Abstract
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical
role in tumor progression. To obtain a broad view of the
molecules involved in EMT, we carried out a comparative
proteomic analysis of transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-B1)–
induced EMT in AML-12 murine hepatocytes. A total of 36
proteins with significant alterations in abundance were
identified. Among these proteins, ferritin heavy chain (FHC),
a cellular iron storage protein, was characterized as a novel
modulator in TGF-B1–induced EMT. In response to TGF-B1,
there was a dramatic decrease in the FHC levels, which caused
iron release from FHC and, therefore, increased the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). Abolishing the increase in LIP
blocked TGF-B1–induced EMT. In addition, increased LIP levels
promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which in turn activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
The elimination of ROS inhibited EMT, whereas H2O2 treatment
rescued TGF-B1–induced EMT in cells in which the LIP increase
was abrogated. Overexpression of exogenous FHC attenuated
the increases in LIP and ROS production, leading to a
suppression of EMT. We also showed that TGF-B1–mediated
down-regulation of FHC occurs via 3¶ untranslated region–
dependent repression of the translation of FHC mRNA.
Moreover, we found that FHC down-regulation is an event that
occurs between the early and highly invasive advanced stages in
esophageal adenocarcinoma and that depletion of LIP or ROS
suppresses the migration of tumor cells. Our data show that
cellular iron homeostasis regulated by FHC plays a critical role
in TGF-B1–induced EMT. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5340–8]

Introduction
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which
epithelial cells lose epithelial polarity and cell-cell contact and
acquire a mesenchymal morphology to become more motile and
invasive. It is implicated in embryonic development, wound repair,
and fibrotic diseases, and it contributes to tumor-invasive
phenotypes and metastasis (1). EMT is characterized by the
dramatic morphologic transition, disruption, or attenuation of

tight junctions and adhesion junctions, with diminished E-cadherin
and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression and up-regulation of
mesenchymal markers, such as fibronectin and vimentin. Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is a potent EMT inducer.
Increased TGF-h expression has been observed in many tumors,
and it is regarded as an important indicator of cancer progression
because it contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis through
the induction of EMT (2, 3). It has become increasingly evident that
both TGF-h and EMT are involved in the same various physiologic
and pathologic events. Smad family proteins that cooperate with
other signaling molecules, such as Ras–mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, nuclear factor-nB,
and Wnt (4), and transcriptional factors, such as Snail (5), Slug (6),
Twist (7), and Zeb1/2 (8), have emerged as important factors in
TGF-h–induced EMT in some types of epithelial cells.
In vertebrates, ferritin, the main cellular iron storage protein, is
composed of 24 peptides of two subunits: ferritin heavy chains
(FHC) and ferritin light chains (FLC). These subunits assemble into
a large, spherical complex with a cavity in which iron molecules are
stored (9). FHC has a ferroxidase function. Excess cellular iron is
catalyzed by FHC into the nontoxic ferric form and stored in a
ferritin complex, maintaining normal iron homeostasis. In
addition, FHC is the major controller of the labile iron pool (LIP;
ref. 10). Repression of FHC leads to iron release from the ferritin
complex and an increase in the cellular LIP (11, 12), whereas
overexpression of FHC can decrease LIP (13, 14). LIP is a pool of
chelatable and redox active iron (10). A high level of LIP results in
oxidative damage by catalyzing reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation in mitochondria. Regulation of LIP levels by FHC may
be involved in important biological events, such as apoptosis, cell
cycle arrest, and inflammation (15, 16). However, it remains
unknown whether TGF-h1 can regulate FHC and LIP and whether
FHC and LIP are implicated in TGF-h1–induced EMT.
To investigate the alteration of global protein profiles and search
for the specific proteins involved in TGF-h1–induced EMT, twodimensional electrophoresis coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry method was applied in this study. Among the significantly
altered expressed proteins, FHC was found to be involved in
TGF-h1–induced EMT. Further investigation showed that TGF-h1
repressed the de novo synthesis of FHC at the translational level and
led to a dramatic decrease in the level of FHC, which plays an
important role in TGF-h1–induced EMT by increasing the LIP level
and ROS generation.

proteome profiles of AML-12 cells with or without TGF-h1
treatment were compared using two-dimensional PAGE. More
than 2,000 protein spots per gel were displayed after silver

changed (>1.5-fold). A total of 36 spots were successfully
identified by MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), and they were assigned
to six functional categories based primarily on information
obtained from Gene Ontology, KEGG (18), and ExPasy (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Among the identified proteins, we found that both FHC and FLC
of ferritin were markedly down-regulated by TGF-h1 (Fig. 1B).
Consistent with the proteomics results, a similar decrease in the
amount of FHC protein was detected by immunoblotting, which
dropped to an almost undetectable level 48 hours after TGF-h1
treatment in AML-12 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, down-regulation of FHC
during TGF-h1 treatment was also observed in A549, a human lung

adenocarcinoma cell line, and in mouse primary hepatocytes, both
of which undergo EMT in response to TGF-h1 (Fig. 1C ;
Supplementary Fig. S2). As the main cellular iron storage protein,
the dynamic abundance of ferritin is closely related to LIP levels. It
is known that the down-regulation of FHC causes the release of
iron from the ferritin complex, which increases the LIP levels (19).
As shown in Fig. 1D, TGF-h1 induced significant increases in LIP in
AML-12 and A549 cells.
The increase in LIP levels is involved in TGF-B1–induced
EMT. Desferrioxamine (DFO) is an iron chelator that can
effectively impair the cellular LIP level. To investigate whether
the increase in LIP caused by iron released from FHC is related to
TGF-h1–induced EMT, we first examined the effect of DFO on

FHC-Controlled LIP Regulates TGF-b1–Induced EMT

EMT. In the presence of DFO, TGF-h1–induced up-regulation of
fibronectin and down-regulation of E-cadherin were inhibited in
both AML-12 and A549 cells (Fig. 2A). These results support a role
of increased LIP in TGF-h1–induced EMT. To further confirm
the role of increased LIP in EMT, we established several RNA
interference (RNAi)–stable clones of AML-12 (iFHC; Fig. 2B).
The knockdown of FHC mitigates the capacity for iron storage of
the cells. In iFHC cells, we found that the basal levels of LIP were
not elevated (Fig. 2C). One possible explanation for this is that
the increased LIP resulting from an FHC knockdown might be
exhausted during the long periods of iFHC cell clone selection.
Because of the very low levels of FHC in iFHC cells, no further FHC
down-regulation or iron release can be induced by TGF-h1 in these
cells. Thus, compared with vector-transfected cells, iFHC cells lost
the ability to increase the LIP in response to TGF-h1 (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, we compared the degree of EMT in TGF-h1–treated
iFHC cells and control cells. The morphologic changes in the
characteristic of EMT were apparently inhibited in iFHC cells 48
hours after TGF-h1 stimulation (Fig. 2D, top). The corresponding

www.aacrjournals.org

changes in the levels of EMT marker proteins induced by
TGF-h1 were inhibited in iFHC cells (Fig. 2D, bottom left). In
addition, ZO-1 translocation from the cell membrane to the cytosol
and nuclei, another characteristic phenotype of EMT, was also
inhibited by FHC knockdown (Fig. 2D, bottom right). These results
indicate that a TGF-h1–induced elevation of LIP plays an
important role in EMT.
LIP participates in EMT via the promotion of ROS
production. To further investigate the regulatory mechanism of
EMT by LIP elevation, we examined whether TGF-h1–induced
EMT is dependent on ROS production catalyzed by elevated LIP. In
accordance with the LIP increase, ROS levels markedly increased
after TGF-h1 treatment (Fig. 3A). The depletion of LIP by DFO
apparently inhibits ROS generation (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined
the effect of NAC, a ROS scavenger, on EMT. NAC inhibited the
alterations in the morphology of AML-12 cells in a dose-dependent
manner and also abolished TGF-h1–mediated up-regulation of
fibronectin and down-regulation of E-cadherin in AML-12 and
A549 cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, ROS elevation was not observed in

iFHC cells, in which LIP cannot be elevated in response to TGF-h1
(Fig. 3C, left). Interestingly, treatment with H2O2, a well-known
oxidant that can increase ROS, restored the TGF-h1–induced
morphologic changes and down-regulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1
in iFHC cells (Fig. 3C, middle and right). Taken together, these
results show that LIP participates in TGF-h1–induced EMT
through promoting ROS production.
To further confirm the role of LIP and ROS in EMT and
investigate the potential downstream mechanism of this pathway
in EMT, we examined the activation status of p38 MAPK. TGF-h1
treatment activated p38 MAPK, as shown by its increased
phosphorylated form (Fig. 3D, top left). SB203580, a p38 MAPK
inhibitor, markedly suppressed TGF-h1–induced EMT, and this
effect can be generated even 12 or 24 hours after the TGF-h1
induction (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that the activation of
p38 is critical for EMT. Next, we found that NAC and DFO
dramatically inhibited the TGF-h1–induced phosphorylation of
p38. Compared with mock-transfected cells, activation of p38
MAPK did not occur in iFHC cells in response to TGF-h1.
Moreover, treatment of cells with H2O2 alone led to the activation
of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that p38 MAPK is a
potential downstream of ROS. TGF-h1 also induces apoptosis in
AML-12 cells (20). We found that stable knockdown of FHC or
treatment with NAC had no apparent effect on the percentage of
apoptosis induced by TGF-h1 (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting
that FHC-LIP-ROS is not implicated in TGF-h1–induced apoptosis.
TGF-B1 represses FHC synthesis at the translational level. To
elucidate the mechanism by which TGF-h1 down-regulates FHC,
we investigated the transcription, translation, and degradation of
FHC before and after TGF-h1 treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, the
FHC mRNA levels remained unchanged and, thus, are apparently
not subjected to regulation by TGF-h1. Our data also indicated that
there is a constitutive turnover of FHC through lysosome and
proteasome pathways. However, TGF-h1 does not down-regulate
FHC through promoting FHC degradation (Supplementary Fig. S5).
It has been reported that translational regulation is implicated in
the regulation of FHC levels (9, 21, 22). We found that the FHC level
was down-regulated by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
treatment and that treatment of cells with TGF-h1 and cycloheximide together did not enhance the decrease of FHC (Fig. 4B),
implying that the regulation of FHC by TGF-h1 is at the
translational level. To confirm this mechanism, we transfected
plasmids encoding myc-tagged FHC (FHC-myc) mRNA without
untranslated regions (UTR; the main translational regulation
region) into AML-12 cells and found that TGF-h1 cannot downregulate the exogenous FHC-myc, although there was a significant
decrease in endogenous FHC (Fig. 4C). Considering that the
myc tag may affect the degradable property of exogenous FHC,
we treated transfected cells with cycloheximide and MG132,
respectively. We found that the exogenous FHC, as well as
endogenous FHC, can still be down-regulated by cycloheximide
and up-regulated by MG132 (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that
the inhibitory effect of TGF-h1 on FHC expression depends on the
UTRs of FHC mRNA. To test whether it is 5¶ UTR or 3¶ UTR that is
responsible for translational inhibition of FHC by TGF-h1, we
attached 5¶ UTR or/and 3¶ UTR to a luciferase reporter gene
and found that the luciferase activity was inhibited by TGF-h1 in
cells transfected with plasmids containing 3¶ UTR or containing
both 3¶ UTR and 5¶ UTR, but not in cells transfected with only
5¶ UTR-containing plasmids (Fig. 4D). These results show that
TGF-h1 represses FHC synthesis at the translational level and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

that the 3¶ UTR of FHC mRNA is responsible for its translational
repression.
Overexpression of FHC abolishes LIP increase, ROS production, and EMT. To further investigate the role of TGF-h1–induced
FHC down-regulation in EMT, we examined the effect of overexpression of exogenous FHC, which cannot be down-regulated by
TGF-h1 because of a lack of UTRs, on LIP increases, ROS
production, and EMT. Figure 5A shows the transfection efficiency
of exogenous FHC-myc. Compared with transfection of the
pcDNA3.1 vector, the overexpression of FHC-myc inhibited the
down-regulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1 and EMT-characterized
morphologic changes with TGF-h1 treatment (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
the TGF-h1–induced LIP increase and ROS production were
inhibited in FHC-overexpressed AML-12 cells (Fig. 5C and D).
Collectively, these results indicate that TGF-h1–induced FHC
down-regulation plays an important role in LIP increase, ROS
production, and subsequent EMT.
FHC down-regulation is associated with tumor cell invasiveness and migration. Considering the relationship between
EMT and tumor invasion and metastasis, we are interested in
whether FHC down-regulation is correlated with tumor invasive
and migratory capacities. It has been reported that TGF-h1–
mediated EMT plays a role in the invasiveness of esophageal
adenocarcinoma (23). We investigated the FHC levels in esophageal
cancer tissues using an immunohistochemistry assay. Early-stage
carcinoma cells and their adjacent epithelial cells expressed high
levels of FHC. However, in advanced-stage carcinoma, especially in
scattered and invasive tumor cells, FHC was down-regulated to
relatively low levels (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we found that NAC and
DFO repressed the TGF-h1–induced migration of A549 human lung
adenocarcinoma cell line (Fig. 6B). These observations support that
FHC down-regulation, and the subsequent regulation of LIP and
ROS may contribute to the migratory and invasive capacities of
tumor cells.

Discussion
Comparative proteomics approaches can provide a broad view of
the molecules involved in various biological processes. We applied
proteomics tools to search for new clues elucidating the molecular
mechanism of TGF-h1–induced EMT. Among the total 36
significantly altered proteins, some are classic TGF-h1–induced
proteins, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and osteoclast
stimulating factor 1, suggesting a high reliability of the data.
Furthermore, some of the altered expressed proteins, such as
myosin light polypeptide 6 and glucose-6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase, have also been observed to be differentially expressed during
TGF-h–induced EMT in lung cancer cells (24). However, the roles
of most of these proteins remain to be characterized.
Ferritin was first identified as the regulator of cellular iron
homeostasis. In addition, it has been shown that the regulation of
FHC levels and the subsequent changes in LIP and ROS are
involved in cell growth arrest, apoptosis, and inflammatory
responses (15, 16, 25). In this study, we showed, for the first
time, that LIP elevation by TGF-h1–induced repression of FHC
plays a key role in EMT. TGF-h1–induced EMT was blocked when
LIP elevation was abolished by several methods. First, the
treatment of cells with DFO can chelate LIP. Second, in FHC
siRNA stably transfected cells, TGF-h1–induced LIP elevation was
suppressed through attenuating the cellular iron storage amount.
Third, transient overexpression of exogenous FHC also abolished

FHC-Controlled LIP Regulates TGF-b1–Induced EMT

TGF-h1–induced LIP elevation by sequestering iron. In all of the
above cases, TGF-h1–induced EMT was suppressed. Although
the LIP elevation is required for TGF-h1–induced EMT, our data
also suggest that the increase in LIP level is not sufficient to induce
EMT. We observed that transient transfection of FHC RNAi
plasmids alone did not induce EMT (data not shown), although
knockdown of FHC by RNAi can increase LIP levels (11, 26). This
suggests that other TGF-h1–activated signaling events are also
critical for EMT.

Ferritin is abundant in some cell lines derived from colon cancer
(27), breast cancer (28), and other types of carcinomas (Expression
Profile from National Center for Biotechnology Information
UniGene database). Nevertheless, it has been reported that FHC
level was relatively low in the high metastatic tumor lines
compared with the low metastatic lines, which exhibited better
differentiated phenotype in bladder tumor model (29) and adenoid
cystic carcinoma (30). Consistent with these reports, in vivo
evidence of esophageal carcinoma showed that FHC levels dropped
greatly in advanced-stage tumors, especially in scattered and
invasive tumor cells compared with normal tissue and early-stage
tumors. These results indicate that the changes in the levels of FHC
between early and advanced stages of tumors may be associated
with the invasive potential of cancers. Furthermore, because TGFh1 is abundant in many malignant tumors and TGF-h1–induced
EMT plays a role in the invasion of esophageal tumor cells (23), the
down-regulation of FHC levels may be induced by TGF-h1 and
contribute to EMT induction.
Iron is an essential metal for oxygen transport, electron
transport, and for many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. However,
in vitro and in vivo evidence showed that iron can induce
carcinogenesis in most cancers and that iron overloading can also
be detected in many cancers (31). Efforts have been made to define
the manner in which iron levels increase during carcinogenesis. It
has been found that tumor cells take up iron at a high rate through
increased transferrin receptors and intracellular iron transporters
(32). In the present work, we found that TGF-h1 treatment can
increase LIP levels in both AML-12 cells and A549 cancer cells, and
this effect is dependent on FHC down-regulation. LIP, which
accounts for only f0.2% to 3% of cellular irons, represents a larger
hazard than other forms of iron, because it leads directly to cell
signaling and response through ROS generation. Because a high
level of TGF-h1 is observed in most tumors, increased LIP levels
may be related with the high TGF-h1 levels. Additionally, iron
chelators have been used as antitumor agents because of their
antiproliferation function (33, 34). We also found that DFO
significantly inhibited TGF-h1–induced migration of A549 cells,
suggesting that high levels of iron in tumors also play a role in
tumor progression.
Smad-dependent transcriptional regulations and Smad-independent MAPK activation have been known in TGF-h1–induced EMT
(35). ROS has been reported to play an important role in TGF-h1–
induced EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells through activation of
p38 MAPK (36). In addition, ROS has also been shown to be
involved in the mediation of matrix metalloproteinase 3–induced
EMT by stimulating the expression of the transcription factor Snail
(37). At present, the regulatory mechanism underlying ROS in EMT
still remains unclear. In this study, we observed that TGF-h1
induced a ROS increase in normal and cancer cells during EMT and
showed that the down-regulation of FHC and the subsequent
increase in LIP account for the elevated ROS production. Activation
of p38 MAPK has been reported to be an important signaling event
induced by TGF-h1 through multiple mechanisms, such as TGFh1–activated kinase 1 and ROS (38, 39). We confirmed in this study
that H2O2, as well as TGF-h1, can strongly induce the activation of
p38 MAPK. TGF-h1–induced activation of p38 MAPK sustained
relative long time period, which is consistent with other reports
(39, 40). We also confirmed the role of p38 MPAK in the EMT
process, as p38 MAPK inhibitor can potently inhibit EMT even after
pretreatment with TGF-h1 for 12 or 24 hours. Furthermore,
elimination of LIP and ROS markedly blocked TGF-h1–induced

activation of p38, as well as EMT. These observations suggested
that FHC-LIP-ROS pathway is upstream of the p38 MAPK.
During TGF-h1–induced EMT, the dynamic balance of FHC was
disrupted by TGF-h1, triggering iron release and subsequent ROS
generation. We showed that the disruption of the dynamic balance
of FHC by TGF-h1 occurred through the inhibition of FHC
translation. Regarding the maintenance of intracellular iron and
LIP homeostasis, the known regulatory site of iron responsive
elements is located in the 5¶ UTR of FHC mRNA (9, 41, 42). Here, we
found that TGF-h1 regulates FHC translation via its 3¶ UTR,
suggesting that different regions of mRNA are responsive to
different regulatory signals, through which specific effects can be
produced.
In conclusion, we showed that FHC down-regulation and the
subsequent LIP increase mediate TGF-h1–induced EMT through
ROS generation. The data also indicate that FHC down-regulation
is associated with the migratory and invasive phenotypes of
