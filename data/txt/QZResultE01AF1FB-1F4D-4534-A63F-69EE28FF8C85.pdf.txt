Abstract:
Galectins are a family of β-galactoside-binding lectins that exert diverse
extracellular and intracellular effects. Galectin-7 and galectin-1 show opposing
effects on proliferation and survival in different cell types. Galectin-7 is a p53-induced
gene and an enhancer of apoptosis, whereas galectin-1 induces tumorigenicity
and resistance to apoptosis in several types of cancers. We show here that in cells
derived from neurofibromin-deficient (Nf1–/–) malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (MPNSTs), Ras inhibition by S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic-acid (FTS;
Salirasib) shifts the pattern of galectin expression. Whereas FTS decreased levels of
both active Ras and galectin-1 expression, it dramatically increased both the mRNA
and protein expression levels of galectin-7. Galectin-7 accumulation was mediated
through JNK inhibition presumably resulting from the observed induction of p53,
and was negatively regulated by the AP-1 inhibitor JDP2. Expression of galectin-7
by itself decreased Ras activation in ST88-14 cells and rendered them sensitive
to apoptosis. This observed shift in galectin expression pattern together with the
accompanying shift from cell proliferation to apoptosis represents a novel pattern of
Ras inhibition by FTS. This seems likely to be an important phenomenon in view of the
fact that both enhanced cell proliferation and defects of apoptosis constitute major
hallmarks of human cancers and play a central role in the resistance of MPNSTs to
anti-cancer treatments. These findings suggest that FTS, alone or in combination with
chemotherapy agents, may be worth developing as a possible treatment for MPNSTs.

INTRODUCTION

cells (cytoplasm and nucleus) and are also secreted into
the extracellular space. Although originally considered
only as extracellular structural elements, a large body of
evidence testifying to their role in intracellular signaling
has accumulated over the last decade. Galectins have
been implicated in several cellular processes, including
apoptosis, cell survival, cell adhesion, immune response,
and gene expression (reviewed in [11] and [12]).
Overexpression of galectin-1, a prototype member of
this family, has been documented in many different tumor
types [13-15], and in various aspects of tumor biology
including migration and invasiveness, chemoresistance
[16], angiogenesis [17], immune escape [18] and
malignant progression [19-21]. Galectin-1 interacts with
the small GTPases H-Ras-GTP in the plasma membrane,

The Ras superfamily control many cellular functions
including cell growth, differentiation, motility and
survival [1-6] and play a major role in cell transformation.
They alternate between a GDP-bound (inactive) and a
GTP-bound (active) state through the action of guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs) and GTPase
activating proteins (RasGAPS). Active Ras was found to
interact specifically with two members of the galectins
family; galectin-1 and galectin-3. [7-9].
Galectins are a phylogenetically conserved family
of lectins that share consensus amino-acid sequences
and the carbohydrate recognition domain responsible for
β-galactoside binding [10]. They are located within the

resulting in stabilization of H-Ras-GTP, clustering of
H-Ras-GTP and galectin-1 in non-raft microdomains [22],
subsequent binding to Raf-1 (but not to PI3K or Ral-GEF
[7, 23]), activation of the ERK signaling pathway, and
increased cell transformation [7].
As opposed to galectin-1, galectin-7—another
member of the galectin superfamily—displays proapoptotic activity in various types of cells. Expression of
galectin-7 is induced in the early steps of p53-mediated
apoptosis and has been designated as the product of the
p53-induced gene 1 (PIG1) [24]. A major function of
p53 is control of apoptosis homeostasis [25], and it is the
most frequently mutated gene in human tumors [25]. As
opposed to galectin-7, galectin-1 is downregulated by
p53 in glioma cells [26]. In line with its pro-apoptotic
activity, galectin-7 inhibits DLD-1 cell proliferation
in vitro and in vivo [27, 28] and is downregulated in
transformed keratinocytes [29]. UVB irradiation induces
apoptosis and galectin-7 expression in dependence
with p53 [30, 31]. Ectopic expression of galectin-7 in
HeLa and DLD-1 cells renders them more sensitive to a
variety of apoptotic triggers, causes enhanced caspase-3
activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and
accelerated mitochondrial cytochrome-C release [32]. In
addition, galectin-7 was found to bind directly to Bcl-2
in the mitochondria and to sensitize the mitochondria to
apoptotic signals [33].
While galectin-7 negatively regulates some tumor
types, it can stimulate the growth and/or development
of others [34-37]. It thus seems that galectin-7 can act
either as a positive or as a negative regulatory factor in
tumor development, depending on the histological type
of the tumor. Although the effect of p53 on galectin-7
expression is well established, little is known about how
its transcription is regulated.
Although, as mentioned above, changes in
expression levels of galectins have been implicated
in many types of diseases including cancer, the role
of galectins in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is still
unknown. NF1 has an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance with a prevalence of about 1 in 3000 live
births. It harbors a variety of phenotypes. The hallmark
of NF1 is the neurofibroma, a benign peripheral nerve
tumor comprised of transformed Schwann cells [38].
Neurofibromas undergo transformation into aggressive and
chemotherapy-resistant malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (MPNSTs), which are prone to life-threatening
metastasis [39].
Loss of neurofibromin Ras-GAP activity is
associated with increased Ras-GTP and overactivation
of Ras effectors [40], and reviewed in [41], leading to
NF1 [42, 43]. The role of Ras in NF1-based malignancy
suggests that Ras inhibitors such as S-trans, transfarnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; Salirasib), which
interfere with Ras-membrane anchorage [3], are likely
to have useful therapeutic activity. Importantly, FTS
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

interferes, both in vitro and in vivo, with the transformed
phenotype of NF1-associated MPNST cell lines [44].
We recently discovered that FTS reverses the epithelialmesenchymal (EMT)-like transition phenotype of NF1deficient MPNST cells by perturbing the signaling of bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)4 and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β1 to SMAD-dependent and ERK-dependent
pathways, inhibiting motility, spreading and gelatinase
secretion, and alternating gene expression [45].
The activator protein-1(AP)-1 transcription-factor
complex, which participates actively in cell proliferation,
differentiation and cell transformation, is composed of
homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes consisting of
members of the Jun: Fos and Jun dimerization protein 2
(JDP2), activating transcription factors (ATFs) and other
proteins [46]. c-jun, which is phosphorylated by c-Jun
terminal kinase (JNK) through Ras-induced signaling
[47-49], cooperates with Ras in cell transformation [50,
51] and has been shown to interfere with p53-induced
apoptosis [52, 53]. JDP2 heterodimerizes with c-jun [54],
and functions as a repressor of the AP-1 protein family
by interfering with the c-jun-induced transformation
[55]. JDP2 inhibits cell proliferation [56] and cell
transformation, both induced by Ras [57]. Thus, on the
one hand JDP2 inhibits cell transformation induced by
Ras; on the other hand, it has been identified as a candidate
oncogene in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma [58] and in a
high-throughput screen in mice [59-61].
Here we show that Ras inhibition in NF1-deficient
MPNST cells dramatically increases galectin-7 expression
and decreases the expression of galectin-1. The increase
in galectin-7 was dependent on JNK inhibition. We found
that expression of galectin-7 itself modulates Ras signaling
and renders MPNST cells more sensitive to apoptosis,
suggesting the possible existence of cross-talk between
Ras and galectin-7.

RESULTS
Ras inhibition induces galectin-7 and reduces
galectin-1 expression in NF1-deficient MPNST
cells
Ras inhibition by FTS in NF1-deficient MPNST
cells inhibits their transformed phenotype both in vitro
and in vivo [44], reverses their EMT-like phenotype, and
alters gene expression [45]. One of the most significantly
upregulated genes in our microarray analysis was the
β-galactosidase-binding lectin, galectin-7, with an increase
of 22.6-fold in its transcript in ST88-14 cells after FTS
treatment. Galectin-7 is considered to be an apoptotic
regulator, whose mRNA is highly induced by p53 [24]
and whose expression sensitizes HeLa and DLD-1 cells to
apoptosis through enhanced caspase-3 activity [32].

Treatment with FTS (75 µM, 48 h, 5% serum)
markedly increased the amounts of galectin-7 protein in
the NF1-deficient MPNST cell lines ST88-14 (Figure
1A, 211% of control, p<0.001, n=6) and T265p21
(supplementary Figure 1A). No such increase was seen
after FTS treatment of the non-NF1 STS26T cell line or
of the NF1-deficient cell line 90-8 (Supplementary Figure
1A). It is worth noting that both of the cell lines in which
Ras inhibition induced an increase in galectin-7 (i.e.,
ST88-14 and T265P21) harbor wild-type p53, whereas
the two cell lines in which galectin-7 was unaffected by
FTS harbor mutated p53 [66]. FTS treatment of ST8814 cells also increased their galectin-7 mRNA content,
as detected by real-time PCR (Figure 1B, 1040% of
control, p<0.05, n=4). In contrast to galectin-7 mRNA, our
microarray analysis indicated that galectin-1 mRNA was

downregulated by 14 fold following FTS treatment, a trend
that was validated by real-time PCR analysis (Figure 1B,
76% of control, p<0.05, n=4) and was accompanied by a
decrease in galectin-1 protein in ST88-14 cells (Figure 1A,
64% of control, p<0.01, n=4). These results are consistent
with earlier reports of galectin-1 downregulation by
inhibition of Ras [7, 8].
To follow the dynamics of the FTS-induced increase
in galectin-7 mRNA and protein, we treated ST88-14 cells
with FTS (75 µM, 5% FCS), and monitored the change
over time by real-time PCR and Western blotting for
different time periods From 12 h after FTS treatment
galectin-7 mRNA increased in a time-dependent manner,
reaching a plateau at 48 h after treatment. Galectin-7
protein levels started to increase at 24 h after treatment
and reached a maximum at 72 h (Figure 1C).

Galectin-7 expression is induced by JNK
inhibition

To determine whether the FTS-induced upregulation
in galectin-7 protein was a result of the Ras inhibition,
we evaluated galectin-7 in ST88-14 and T265P21 cells
transfected with GFP-H-Ras(17N) (dnRas) or, as a
control, with GFP. Transfection of dnRas induced a
significant increase in galectin-7 expression levels in both
the ST88-14 (Figure 1D, 280% of GFP, p<0.05, n=4)
and the T265p21 cells (Supplementary Figure 1B, 122%
of GFP, p<0.06, n=3). As expected, the cells transfected
with dnRas exhibited decreased ERK phosphorylation,
indicating that the transfected vector was indeed reducing
Ras activation (Figure 1D). This strengthens the notion
that the FTS-induced increase in galectin-7 is a result of
Ras inhibition.
The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
completely inhibited the FTS-induced increase in
galectin-7 (Supplementary Figure 1C), further supporting
the notion that regulation of the transcription was mediated
by Ras.

To find out which Ras-signaling pathway leads
to the galectin-7 upregulation described above, we
employed several chemical inhibitors of some of the most
prominent Ras effectors: U0126, a MEK inhibitor; LY
294002, a PI3K inhibitor; SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, and
SP600125, a JNK inhibitor. Western blot analysis showed
that phosphorylation of all the relevant target proteins was
curbed by their respective inhibitors (Figure 2A), with
the exception of p38, on which SB203580 had no effect.
Notably, in ST88-14 cells inhibition of the JNK pathway
alone induced a pronounced increase in galectin-7 protein
(Figure 2A, B), which was accompanied by an increase
in galectin-7 mRNA (Figure 2B). Treatment of T265p21
cells with SP600125 also resulted in a robust increase
in galectin-7, like that in ST88-14 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2A).
By using a dominant-negative c-jun protein
(TAM67), we further verified that inhibition of JNK and
its phosphorylation target c-jun indeed induced galectin-7
protein. Transient transfection with TAM67 significantly
increased galectin-7 expression in ST88-14 cells,
strengthening the notion that c-jun is a major player in the
Ras-induced increase in galectin-7.

Ras inhibition induces galectin-7 transcription
through p53, c-jun, and JDP2
Following the notion that galectin-7 accumulates
in response to inhibition of Ras or c-jun, we examined
whether Ras inhibition in ST88-14 cells directly inhibits
c-jun. A decrease in phospho-c-jun in these cells was
indeed observed after treatment with FTS (Figure 3A,
67% of control, *p<0.05, n=3), suggesting that Ras
inhibition induces galectin-7 expression by inhibiting
c-jun activation.
Expression of galectin-7 is regulated by the tumor
suppressor p53 [24], which is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in cancer [25]. Analysis of the promoter
region of galectin-7 gene using a Genomatix Genome
Analyzer (Genomatix Software GmbH [65]) indeed
revealed a putative p53-binding site (Supplementary
Figure 2B). ST88-14 cells harbor wild-type p53, although
its levels under normal growth conditions are small. We
therefore followed changes in the amounts of p53 protein
after FTS-induced inhibition of Ras in ST88-14 and
T265P21 cells. In agreement with results obtained in the
case of colon cancer [67], treatment with FTS resulted
in a significant accumulation of p53 protein (ST88:

Upregulation of p53 in ST88-14 cells was also found

transcription through p53 and c-jun. (A, B) ST8814 cells were treated for 48 h with FTS (75 µM, 5% FCS) or

c-jun (A) or anti-p53 (B) antibodies. GAPDH served as loading
control. Immunoblots from a typical experiments are shown
in the left panels; graphs depicting quantification{?depicting

here to lead to a significant decrease in the anti-apoptotic
protein survivin (Fig 3C, 45% of control, p<0.01, n=5) and
in its mRNA (Figure 3C, 8% of control, p<0.001, n=4).
This was an interesting finding, in view of a report that
transcription of survivin is repressed by wild-type p53
[68, 69]. Our finding is also in line with the previously
described decrease in survivin by FTS in U87 [70] and
DLD1 cells [71].
Given our observations that JNK inhibition induced
a dramatic increase in galectin-7 and that FTS itself
inhibits c-jun phosphorylation, we searched for c-jun
regulatory elements in the galectin-7 promoter. Using
Genomatix, we found putative binding sites for AP-1 and
for the AP-1 inhibitor JDP2 (Supplementary Figure 2B).
Because JDP2 participates in the p53 signaling pathway
[72] and is regulated by c-jun [73], we investigated its
possible involvement in the regulation of galectin-7
transcription. First, we analyzed changes in the amounts
of JDP2 mRNA after FTS treatment. Figure 4A shows that
JDP2 transcripts were increased by 2.5-fold in FTS-treated
cells compared to control (**p<0.01, n=6). Inhibition of
JNK by SP600125 also increased JDP2 mRNA (Figure
4B, 1.7-fold compared to control, ** p<0.01, n=3).
Other studies demonstrated the phosphorylation of JDP2
on Thr148 by JNK leading the protein to proteasomal
degradation [73], supporting the negative role of JNK on
JDP2 levels.

Next, we examined effect of using a specific small
interfering RNA (siRNA) to decrease JDP2 expression.
Figure 4C shows that transfection of cells with a specific
siRNA against JDP2 reduced JDP expression to 0.36fold of that obtained with a nonspecific siRNA (*p<0.05,
n=3). In the latter transfected cells, the FTS-induced
increase in JDP2 was maintained (Figure 4C, 2.8-fold of
control; ***p<0.001, n=3), exactly as shown in Figure
1A. However, JDP2-siRNA markedly decreased the
FTS-induced JDP2 accumulation to 0.14-fold of that in
the non-target-siRNA transfected cells treated with FTS.
Surprisingly, after the former transfection, induction
of galectin-7 mRNA in the FTS-treated cells showed a
dramatic 83.3-fold increase compared to an increase of
only 5.2-fold in the control FTS-treated cells transfected
with non-target siRNA (Figure 4D). Accumulation of
galectin-7 mRNA was also significantly increased without
FTS treatment: in cells transfected with siRNA for JDP2
and treated with vehicle, galectin-7 mRNA was 1.46-fold
higher than in the nonspecific siRNA transfectants (Figure
4D, **p<0.01, n=3).

Galectin-7 expression inhibits Ras and sensitizes
ST88-14 cells to apoptosis
We have previously shown that galectin-1
expression stabilizes Ras in its GTP-binding state and

that antisense galectin-1 reduces Ras activation [7].
Having detected an increase in galectin-7 and a decrease
in galectin-1 in ST88-14 cells after Ras inhibition, we
wanted to find out whether expression of galectin-7
affects Ras activation. To that end, ST88-14 cells were
infected with viruses containing galectin-7 DNA (ST88/
gal7) or, as a control, GFP (ST88/GFP). After selection
and validation of expression, the amounts of Ras-GTP
in the ST88/gal7 cells were compared to those in ST88/
GFP and in noninfected ST88-14 cells. Notably, stable
expression of galectin-7 in ST88-14 cells resulted in a

marked reduction of Ras activity to 58% of that in GFPinfected or noninfected cells (Figure 5A, **p<0.01, n=3).
We could not detect any significant changes in pERK,
p-Akt or p-c-jun levels (data not shown).
That galectin-7 expression sensitizes cells to
caspase-mediated apoptosis induced by several agents
has by now been well established [32]. Unpublished data
from our lab has demonstrated that treatment of ST8814 cells with FTS together with several chemotherapy
agents. i.e., paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or cisplatin induces
a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and enhances cell
death. We therefore examined whether the FTS-induced
accumulation of galectin-7 might render NF1-deficient
cells more sensitive to apoptosis. ST88-14 and ST88/
gal 7 cells were treated with different cell-death inducers
(paclitaxel, cisplatin, or serum deprivation (0.2% FCS))
and assayed for cell viability using annexin-V/PI staining
followed by FACS analysis. As shown in Figure 5B,
expression of galectin-7 reduced the percentage of live
(nonapoptotic) cells as indicated by negative staining
for both PI and annexin-V. Those results indicate that
galectin-7 expression sensitizes ST88-14 cells to apoptotic
triggers, in agreement with the report by Kuwabara et al.
[32].
Next, we examined the nature of galectin-7-induced
susceptibility to apoptosis. Galectin-7 expression has
been shown to cause enhanced caspase-3 activity [14,
32] and to sensitize urothelial cancers to cisplatin [28]. In
agreement with these findings we detected high levels of
cleaved caspase-3 in ST88/gal7 cells, whereas in control

ST88-14 cells (ST88) or ST88-14 cells stably infected with

and inhibits galectin-7 expression through JNK. Galectin-1
itself stabilizes and increases Ras-GTP, thereby inducing
transformation. Inhibition of Ras by FTS or dnRas reduces
galectin-1 expression and induces robust expression of
galectin-7. High levels of galectin-7 inhibit Ras activation and
sensitize cells to apoptosis.

induced as a result of cellular stress such as UV irradiation
[30, 31] and is mediated by p53 [24, 75]. We report
here, for the first time, that the expression of galectin-7
is negatively regulated by Ras-GTP. In the MPNSTs of
NF1 patients, lack of functional neurofibromin leads
to chronically active Ras. Inhibition of Ras in MPNST
cells in the present study led to dramatic expression of
galectin-7, mediated most probably through the FTSinduced decrease in p-c-jun levels, since inhibition of JNK
or c-jun yielded similar induction of galectin-7. Notably,
in two p53-mutated MPNST cell lines, STS26T and
90-8 [66], no increase in galectin-7 after Ras inhibition
was detectable. It thus seems that p53 is a key factor in
galectin-7 expression. Moreover, FTS-induced inhibition
of Ras significantly increased p53 expression and the
consequent reduction of survivin in the wild-type p53
cell lines. Induction of p53 after Ras inhibition has been
reported in colon cancer [76] and in pancreatic cancer
[67] cell lines. Inhibition of c-jun was shown to promote
apoptosis, arguably through a p53-dependent mechanism,
and to reduce liver cancer in mice [52].
We postulate that in NF1-deficient MPNST cells,
high Ras activity results in low p53 levels together with
intense c-jun phosphorylation. P-c-jun then heterodimerize
with JDP2 to inhibit the galectin-7 promoter. Ras
inhibition induced by FTS treatment increases p53
levels, thereby triggering p53-dependent galectin-7
transcription. The FTS-induced Ras inhibition also
inhibits c-jun phosphorylation, thus dispersing the c-jun/
JDP2 heterodimer and allowing galectin-7 transcription.
Indeed, decreasing JDP2 levels using specific siRNA
might also disperse the dimer thereby freeing the gal7
promoter and making the cells more sensitive to FTSinduced galectin-7 accumulation. High galectin-7 levels
in turn rendered MPNST cells more sensitive to apoptotic
factors, promoted the apoptosis process and restrained
Ras activity, thus sensitizing the cells to chemotherapy
or radiotherapy. In addition, the secreted galectin-7
might be taken up by neighboring cells and affect their
Ras signaling, as previously reported for galectin-1
[77]. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate a possible
reciprocity in galectin-7/Ras relations, since galectin-7
itself reduced Ras activity. This is reminiscent of the effect
of galectin-1 on stabilizing Ras in its GTP-binding state
[7].
Galectin-1 promotes tumor growth [15, 19-21]
and has been described as a cytokine-like factor that
participates in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis
[17]. Moreover, Ras can be dislodged from the plasma
membrane by inhibition of galectin-1 employing antisense DNA [7], by application of the anti-angiogenic
peptide anginex [77], or by disruption (via a point
mutation (11A) [78]) of its ability to bind Ras. This results
in a decrease in Ras-GTP and inhibition of the Raf-MEKERK cascade [7, 77, 78]. Previously we indeed observed
that anginex significantly inhibits proliferation of NF1-

DISCUSSION
We show here that in the NF1-deficient ST8814 and T265P21 MPNST cell lines, Ras inhibition by
FTS or dnRas dramatically induced expression of the
pro-apoptotic protein galectin-7 (Figure 1 for ST88-14,
Supplementary Figure 1B for T265P21). This was evident
(for ST88-14) from the microarray analysis (22.6-fold
increase), RT‒PCR (1040% of control), and western
blotting (211% of control). In contrast, FTS treatment
reduced the expression of galectin-1, as also shown by
microarray analysis, real-time PCR, and western blot
analysis (Figure 1A, B). The negative regulation of Ras
on galectin-7 expression is probably mediated through the
consequent activation of the JNK‒c-jun pathway, because
the inhibition of JNK by SP600125 or dn‒c-jun, but not
inhibitors of other Ras signaling pathways, reproduced the
FTS-induced increase in galectin-7 protein seen in ST8814 and T265P21 cells (Figure 2A‒C and Supplementary
Figure 2A). Moreover, FTS treatment itself inhibited c-jun
phosphorylation (Figure 3A).
Bioinformatics analysis of galectin-7 upstream
elements revealed predicted AP-1/c-jun and p53 regulatory
elements. The role of p53 in galectin-7 induction has been
well established [24, 26, 30] [31]. In conformity with this,
the FTS-induced increase in galectin-7 was accompanied
by an increase in the amounts of p53 protein (Figure
3B). Because galectin-7 was found to increase after Ras
inhibition, it is reasonable to suggest that the regulation
of this increase might be mediated by a c-jun-related
repressor such as JDP2. This protein binds members
of the AP-1 family such as c-jun, ATF-3, and ATF-2,
preventing them from exerting their transcription activity
[74]. The galectin-7 promoter also contains a potential
JDP2-binding element. Accordingly, inhibition of JDP
expression by siRNA transfection resulted in a dramatic
increase in galectin-7 mRNA after FTS treatment (a 5.2fold increase compared to FTS-treated control siRNAtransfected cells, and an increase of 83-fold compared to
vehicle-treated control si-RNA transfected cells (Figure
4C, D). Unexpectedly, we also detected an unexplained
increase in JDP2 mRNA after inhibition of Ras or JNK
(Figure 4A, B).
Galectin-7 expression has been shown to sensitize
cells to apoptosis and enhance cleavage of caspase-3 [32,
33]. Importantly, stable expression of galectin-7 in ST8814 cells rendered them more sensitive to apoptotic signals
and induced caspase-3 cleavage under normal growth
conditions (Figure 5B, C). Interestingly, active Ras in
ST88-14 cells stably expressing galectin-7 was reduced
in comparison to that in naȉve or GFP-expressing cells
(Figure 5A).
Studies have shown that expression of galectin-7 is

deficient MPNST cells (unpublished data). Thus, Ras-GTP
might cooperate with galectin-1 to induce tumorigenicity
in NF1-deficient cells, while “shutting down” galectin-7
expression.
Altogether, these results point to a galectin-1/
galectin-7 switch, in which FTS-induced Ras inhibition
reverses the expression pattern of MPNST galectins, as
suggested in the model in Figure 6. Galectin-7 reportedly
has some effects that oppose those of galectin-1: whereas
galectin-1 promotes tumor growth [15, 19-21] and induces
resistance to apoptosis, galectin-7 induces apoptosis in
several types of cancer cells [28, 32]. It is tempting to
speculate on the presence of a mechanism of inhibitory
cross-talk in which in several transformed cells, and
particularly in NF1-deficient MPNSTs, high Ras activity
stimulates galectin-1 and inhibits galectin-7 expression.
Inhibition of Ras-GTP by FTS decreases galectin-1
expression, promoting inhibition of cell transformation
while increasing galectin-7 expression with resulting
heightened sensitivity to apoptosis.
