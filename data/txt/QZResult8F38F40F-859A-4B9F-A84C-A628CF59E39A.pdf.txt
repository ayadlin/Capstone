Abstract
The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase regulates several Bcl-2 family proteins that confer
resistance to apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Given p53’s ability to
modulate the expression and activity of Bcl-2 family members, we hypothesized that
targeting Bcr-Abl, Bcl-2, and p53 concomitantly could have therapeutic benefits in
blast crisis (BC) CML and in quiescent CML CD34+ cells that are insensitive to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI). We examined the effects of the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin3a and
its combination with the dual Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737, and the Bcr-Abl
inhibitor nilotinib on BC CML patient samples. We found that in quiescent CD34+
progenitors, p53 expression is significantly lower, and MDM2 is higher, compared
to their proliferating counterparts. Treatment with nutlin3a induced apoptosis in
bulk and CD34+CD38- cells, and in both proliferating and quiescent CD34+ progenitor
CML cells. Nutlin3a synergized with ABT-737 and nilotinib, in part by inducing proapoptotic, and suppressing anti-apoptotic, Bcl-2 proteins. Nilotinib inhibited the
expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in BC CML cells. These results demonstrate that p53
activation by MDM2 blockade can sensitize BC CML cells, including quiescent CD34+
cells, to Bcl-2 inhibitor- and TKI-induced apoptosis. This novel strategy could be useful
in the therapy of BC CML.

Introduction

an incurable disease with a significant clinical impact.
The current standard of therapy for CML is inactive
against quiescent CML stem/progenitor cells [2-6], which
make up a small fraction of the CD34+ cell population
that is responsible for disease recurrence upon drug
discontinuation [7-9]. Furthermore, in addition to the
stem/progenitor cells derived from hematopoietic stem
cells as described in chronic phase CML, the committed
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in BC CML gain an
abnormal self-renewal capacity [10] that is responsible for

The development of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) is the most successful molecular targeted
therapy to date. Indeed, TKIs were approved as front-line
therapy for patients with chronic phase CML. However,
when patients progresses to blast crisis (BC), CML cells
becomes less responsive to TKIs [1] and few options are
available for these patients. Hence, BC CML is essentially

the rapid cell expansion in BC [11]. Thus, a number of
strategies have been developed pre-clinically, or are under
development clinically, to overcome these problems by
combining TKIs with various other targeted agents [2, 1217].
The oncogenic Bcr-Abl fusion protein promotes
leukemic cell growth and survival through multiple
mechanisms. For example, in addition to triggering
aberrant cell proliferation, a number of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are regulated by BcrAbl tyrosine kinase signaling, which can confer apoptosis
resistance to CML cells [18, 19]. Conversely, inhibition of
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can sensitize CML progenitor
cells to TKIs and other agents [12, 20, 21]. We previously
demonstrated that inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL by ABT-737
alone can induce apoptosis in CD34+ CML BC progenitor
cells, and this effect is further enhanced by combining
ABT-737 with imatinib [14]. This finding suggested an
important role for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in
the survival of CML progenitor cells.
TP53 is a key tumor suppressor gene, and the
modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins is a principal
mechanism of p53-mediated cell death. p53 not only
transcriptionally activates pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members [22-24], it also antagonizes anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-xL in the cytosol and directly contributes to
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis [25, 26]. In recent
years, substantial pre-clinical evidence has confirmed
the activation of p53 by MDM2 (the E3 ligase for p53
[27]) blockade as a promising cancer therapy strategy.
Indeed, reports from our group and others have shown
that the activation of p53 via MDM2 inhibition induces
cell death and enhances efficacy of chemotherapeutic
agents in hematological malignancies [28-32]. Lastly,
overexpression of MDM2 has been reported to correlate
with nutlin3a sensitivity in both AML and ALL [28, 32].
Although TP53 mutation rate is known to increase
with CML disease progression, a 30% reported rate
of BC CML cell mutations is markedly lower than the
frequency of TP53 mutations reported in solid tumors
[33]. Furthermore, increased MDM2 expression in BC
CML compared to latent/chronic phase CML has been
reported [34]. Interestingly, MDM2 has been shown to be
regulated by Bcr-Abl and may play an essential role in
the survival effects of Bcr-Abl signaling [35]. It has been
further reported that p53 activation by SIRT1 inhibition,
in combination with imatinib increased the killing of
CML progenitor cells [36] and that the combination of
nutlin3a with imatinib enhanced CML apoptosis [37].
In addition, p53 stabilization with the MDM2 inhibitor
MI-219 was shown to induce apoptosis in BC CML cells
[38]. These studies suggest the potential for p53 activation
by inhibition of MDM2 as a novel CML therapy, and a
potential therapeutic benefit of p53 activation alone or as
a sensitizer to other therapeutic agents.
In this study, we examined the expression of p53
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and MDM2 in BC CML cells, including proliferating and
quiescent CD34+ CML progenitor cells, and assessed the
effects of nutlin3a and its combination with the Bcl-2
inhibitor ABT-737 and the TKI nilotinib on the viability of
these cells. Given that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment are known to
protect leukemia progenitor cells from chemotherapeutic
agents [39], we also treated the BC CML cells that were
co-cultured with MSCs. We demonstrate that activation
of p53 via nutlin3a-induced MDM2 blockade triggers
apoptosis in BC CML, including in CD34+38- cells and
in TKI-insensitive, quiescent CD34+ CML progenitor
cells. Our findings suggest that MDM2 inhibition acts
synergistically with ABT-737 and nilotinib, even in
the presence of MSCs, at least in part by regulating the
expression of Bcl-2 family proteins.

Results
p53 and MDM2 are variably expressed in samples
from patients with BC CML
To test the therapeutic potential of p53 activation
by nutlin3a in BC CML, we first examined the expression
of p53 using previously stored mononuclear cell lysates
isolated from samples obtained from patients with BC
CML by western blot. We found that the majority of the
samples expressed detectable basal levels of p53 protein
(Figure 1A). Four out of eighteen samples (underlined)
expressed high basal levels of p53 but significantly
lower levels of Bax (Figure 1A) that may indicate
TP53 mutations. To test this, we sequenced TP53 in
the above-referenced samples that had available cDNA
(e.g., marked with * in Figure 1A). To our surprise, no
TP53 hot-spot mutations were detected in these samples.
We next determined the RNA levels of p53 and MDM2
in proliferating and quiescent CD34+ CML progenitor
cells by RT-PCR. Of 18 samples, quiescent CD34+ cells
expressed significantly lower p53 RNA (P = 0.015) and
higher MDM2 RNA (P = 0.009) than the proliferating
CD34+ cells. This pattern was not observed in RNA
derived from normal BM samples (Figure 1B).

MDM2 inhibition induces apoptosis in bulk and
CD34+CD38- cells, and sensitizes them to ABT-737
and nilotinib
Mononuclear cells from BC CML patients who
were resistant to multiple TKIs (samples 4, 5, 7, 8b, and
9, Table 1) were treated with nutlin3a and cell death was
determined at 48 h. Nutlin3a was able to induce cell death
in bulk and CD34+CD38- cells (i.e., phenotypically similar
as hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells) in all samples

analyzed (Figure 2A, triangle lines, n = 5 for bulk and n
= 4 for CD34+CD38- cells). When nutlin3a was combined
with ABT-737 or nilotinib, apoptosis was greatly enhanced
even though the cells were resistant to nilotinib alone
(Figure 2A and Table 1). The CI values for the nutlin3a
+ ABT-737 combination were 0.19 ± 0.06 and 0.62 ±

0.11 for bulk and CD34+CD38- cells, respectively and
for the nutlin3a + nilotinib combination 0.22 ± 0.05 and
0.36 ± 0.06 for bulk and CD34+CD38- cells, respectively.
Importantly, nutlin3a alone or in combination with ABT737 or nilotinib had a minimal activity against CD34+ cells
from normal BM controls (Figure 2B, n = 3).

combination (Figure 4B) suggesting that Noxa and Bim
induction was not a determinant factor for the synergy. In
addition, nutlin3a decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 or both (Figure 5A). Nilotinib also
decreased the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, both at the
RNA and protein levels (Figure 5B), even in patients who
had not responded to nilotinib treatment clinically (Table
1). To demonstrate that decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL
expression is at least in part mediated through nilotinibinduced Bcr-Abl inhibition, we determined p-CrkL levels
as indicators of Bcr-Abl signaling and found that p-CrkL
was greatly decreased in samples 3, 4, and 5 and partially
decreased in sample 8a, while nutlin3a in general did not
affect Bcr-Abl signaling (Figure 5C). We also observed
decreased MDM2 levels in nilotinib treated cells (not
shown). ABT-737 is a known inhibitor for Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL. Therefore, nutlin3a and ABT-737 or nutlin3a
and nilotinib combinations both cooperatively modulate
Bcl-2 family proteins by inducing pro- and inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Figure 5D).

To assess the effect of activation of p53 and its
ability to sensitize other agents in eliminating quiescent
CD34+ CML cells, mononuclear cells from BC CML
patient samples (#1-8a, Table 1) were stained with the
cell division tracking dye CFSE and then co-cultured
with human BM derived MSCs. Once proliferating and
quiescent cells were distinguishable by flow cytometry,
cells were treated with nutlin3a for 48 h with or without
MSC co-culture. We found 1.7 to 24.0% CD34+ cells
were quiescent (Table 1). Nutlin3a was able to induce
apoptosis and decrease viable cell counts not only in
proliferating (EC50 = 7.1 ± 1.6 µM) but also in quiescent
(EC50 = 14.6 ± 2.1 µM) CD34+ CML cells obtained from
BC CML patients (Figure 3, n = 8, Table 1). Although
co-culture with MSCs partially protected leukemic cells
from nutlin3a-induced cell death, nutlin3a was still able to
induce apoptosis in both proliferating (EC50 = 10.9 ± 3.7
µM) and quiescent (EC50 = 34.2 ± 3.7 µM) CD34+ CML
cells (Figure 3).
CFSE stained cells were treated with nutlin3a,
ABT-737, nilotinib, nutlin3a plus ABT-737, or nutlin3a
plus nilotinib. A representative result (patient 3) is
shown in Figure 4A. Although ABT-737 at low nM was
not very active by itself, when combined with nutlin3a,
synergistically increased apoptosis in proliferating (CI =
0.39 ± 0.06) and even more so in quiescent (CI = 0.13
± 0.06) CD34+ CML BC cells. This held up even when
cells were co-cultured with MSCs (CI = 0.44 ± 0.03 for
proliferating and CI = 0.08 ± 0.04 for quiescent CD34+
cells) (Figure 4B, n = 8, Table 1). Similar results were
obtained when nutlin3a was combined with nilotinib in
proliferating (CI = 0.18 ± 0.02 without and CI = 0.05 ±
0.07 with co-culture) and in quiescent CD34+ cells (CI =
0.24 ± 0.05 without and CI = 0.02 ± 0.03 with co-culture)
(Figure 4C, n = 6, Table 1).

Discussion
We report in this study that p53 is variably expressed
in cells from BC CML patient samples, and that MDM2
expression is significantly higher, and p53 expression
is lower, in quiescent compared to proliferating CD34+
progenitor cells. Activation of p53 was shown to induce
apoptosis in bulk and CD34+CD38- BC CML cells, as
well as in proliferating and, most importantly, in TKIinsensitive, CD34+ quiescent BC CML progenitor cells. In
addition, p53 activation in combination with inhibition of
Bcl-2 or Bcr-Abl synergistically induced cell death in these
cells. This effect was achieved in part by concomitantly
inducing pro-apoptotic and suppressing anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins. In agreement with this notion, our group
has reported that nutlin3a and ABT-737 combination
synergistically induces apoptosis in AML cells in part by
inducing the active form of Bax [40]. Nutlin3a alone or
in combinations with ABT-737 or nilotinib was shown to
have limited toxicity in normal CD34+ BM cells.
Low basal levels of p53 were observed in the
majority (14/18) of PB or BM samples from BC CML
patients. Sequence analysis did not find hot-spot mutations
in TP53 even in samples with high p53 expression and
low Bax expression. Interestingly, we found the P72R
mutation in most samples analyzed. This mutation
was reported to maintain p53 activity but its functional
significance is unclear [41]. These data suggest that most
of the patients carry wild-type p53; thus, pharmacological
activation of p53 should be a feasible therapeutic strategy
for this disease. This concept is further supported by our
results showing that treating samples obtained from BC
CML patients with nutlin3a activates p53 and induces
cell death. The mechanisms of lower p53 and higher
MDM2 expression levels in quiescent as compared

Modulation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins as a mechanism of the synergistic
action of MDM2-inhibitor combinations
To better understand the mechanism(s) underlying
the observed synergistic effect, we treated mononuclear
cells from CML patients (Table 1, sample 3, 4, 5, and
8a) with nutlin3a and nilotinib. Nutlin3a induced p53 in
all samples tested and increased expression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Puma, and/or of the active form
of Bax (A647) indicating activation of p53 transcriptional
activity. No consistent increase of Noxa or Bim was
observed (not shown), although all the samples showed
synergistic responses to the nutlin3a and ABT-737

to proliferating CD34+ CML cells are unknown at the
present time. However, Bcl-6-mediated p53 repression in
CML stem cells has been reported [42]. We also observed

higher Bcl-6 levels in quiescent compared to proliferating
CML progenitor cells (result not shown), but defining and
validating this mechanism requires further study.

by nilotinib was likely sufficient to lower the apoptotic
threshold and sensitize CML cells to nutlin3a-induced cell
death, although the mechanism associated with nilotinib’s
activity in the Bcr-Abl-mutant samples remains to be fully
elucidated. ABT-737 is a known Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor
[48, 49]. By simultaneously targeting various arms of
Bcl-2 regulation (as shown in Figure 5D), we were able to
synergistically induce apoptosis in bulk, CD34+CD38-, and
CD34+ proliferating and quiescent progenitor cells from
samples obtained from patients with BC CML even when
cells were not sensitive to a single agent or co-cultured
with MSCs. Interestingly, the degree of drug sensitivity in
each patient sample was not consistent to each treatment
(each of single drug or combinations), under different
culture conditions (with or without co-culture), or in
different cell compartments (proliferating or quiescent
cells) suggesting that each sample responded differently
to each drug and their combinations, was affected
differently by the stromal cells, or had different molecular
signatures in proliferating and quiescent cell populations.
Nevertheless, the combinations were more effective in
apoptosis induction in all patient samples, without or with
co-cultures, and in both proliferating and quiescent CD34+
progenitor cell populations.
In conclusion, combinations of nutlin3a with ABT737 or with nilotinib cooperatively targeted various
determinants of Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis. Activation of
p53 by blockade of MDM2 sensitized BC CML cells,
including CD34+CD38- and quiescent CD34+ progenitor
cells, to TKI- and Bcl-2 inhibitor-induced apoptosis but
had very limited toxicity in CD34+ cells from normal BM
controls, suggesting a potential for utilizing this strategy
in the treatment of BC CML and elimination of quiescent
CML stem/progenitor cells. TKIs are front-line therapies
for CML. MDM2 inhibitors and Bcl-2 inhibitors are in
clinical trials; hence, their combinations are feasible
strategies and could quickly move into clinical trials.

We and others have reported that overexpression
of MDM2 correlated with nutlin3a sensitivity in
both AML and ALL [28, 32]. Although we observed
significantly higher MDM2 levels in quiescent compared
to proliferating CD34+ cells, we found lower, rather than
higher, sensitivity of quiescent CD34+ CML cells to
nutlin3a, compared to proliferating cells. Many factors can
explain this finding such as lower expression levels of p53
in quiescent CD34+ CML cell populations, or a higher BcrAbl kinase activity [14, 43] that may activate alternative
survival pathways.
Although MSCs are known to protect leukemia cells
from various chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis,
these cells only partially abrogated the cytotoxic effects
of nutlin3a and nultin3a in combinations with either ABT737 or nilotinib on the CML cells. We previously reported
that activation of p53 by nutlin3a suppressed CXCL-12
expression and CXCL12 secretion by 70% [44]. CXCR4/
CXCL12-mediated leukemia/stromal interactions are
known to contribute to chemoresistance in CML [45-47]
and are greatly diminished if CXCL12 concentration or
activity is reduced.
Nutlin3a and its combination with ABT-737
and nilotinib both induced apoptosis in bulk and in
CD34+CD38- BC cells with similar efficacy. A subpopulation of CD34+ cells is quiescent. This population
has been shown to be able to engraft NOD/SCID mice
and initiate CML, is insensitive to various therapeutic
agents including TKIs, and is responsible for disease
recurrence after ceasing TKI therapy even in patients who
had achieved molecular responses [7, 8]. We found that
1.7 to 24% of CD34+ cells from BC CML patient samples
analyzed were quiescent. Most importantly, nutlin3a
induced apoptosis in both, proliferating and quiescent
CD34+ BC CML cells. This apoptosis induction was
further enhanced by combining nutlin3a with ABT-737
and nilotinib even in cells from TKI-resistance/relapsed
patients under physiologic MSC co-culture conditions.
We observed that more cell death was induced in bulk
and CD34+CD38- (Figure 2) than CD34+ proliferating and
quiescent CML cells (Figure 4) under the same conditions,
probably because the latter had been cultured with MSCs
for 5-12 d before therapy to distinguish proliferating and
quiescent cells.
We also observed that nutlin3a decreased Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 protein levels. This effect is likely related to
cleavage of these proteins by activated caspases as the
decreases are more obvious in patients 3 and 4 which
showed lower cell viability. CML cells develop resistance
to TKIs through multiple mechanisms that are both BclAbl dependent and independent. Although clinically not
responsive to TKIs including nilotinib, all samples treated
with nilotinib showed inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling as
measured by reduction of p-CrkL and decrease of the BcrAbl downstream target proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. We
speculate that partial suppression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL

were acquired after informed consent following IRB
approved study protocols and in concordance with the
declaration of Helsinki. Patient characteristics are shown
in Table 1. Mononuclear cells, isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque
density-gradient centrifugation from patients and normal
controls were treated with various concentrations of
nutlin3a, ABT-737, nilotinib, nutlin3a plus ABT-737, or
nutlin3a plus nilotinib (Table 1). MSCs were isolated from
BM of healthy subjects as previously described [30, 50].

abundance of each transcript relative to that of ABL1 was
calculated using the 2−ΔCt method, where ΔCt is the mean
Ct of the transcript of interest minus the mean Ct of the
transcript for ABL1.

Mononuclear cells from CML patients (Table
1) were stained with 5-(and 6-) carboxy-fluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) as described [51]. They were then cocultured with MSCs in αMEM /10%FCS medium [13].
After proliferating (CFSEdim) and quiescent (CFSEbright)
cells became distinguishable, cells were either stained
with CD34 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and
sorted (BD FACSAriaTM II sorter, BD Biosciences) into
proliferating or quiescent fractions [14] or treated with
nutlin3a, ABT-737, nilotinib, nutlin3a plus ABT-737, or
nutlin3a plus nilotinib (Table 1) with or without MSCs.

TP53 mutational analysis
TP53 was sequenced using the primers and the
method described previously with modifications [52].
Briefly, the full length open reading frame cDNA
was amplified using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity DNA
polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as
recommended by the manufacturer. Direct sequencing
on both strands was performed using the dideoxy method
with BigDye terminators. Primers were obtained from
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and
sequencing analysis was performed by Lone Star Labs
(Houston, TX).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis in bulk and CD34+CD38- cells was
estimated by flow cytometric measurements of annexin V
stained cells using a BD FACSArray Bioanalyzer. CFSE
stained cells were incubated with CD34 antibody and
7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD). Apoptosis was estimated
in 7AAD- CML progenitor cells using a BD LSR-II flow
cytometer. Apoptotic quiescent or proliferating CML
progenitor cells were defined as annexin V positivity in the
CD34+CFSEbright or CD34+CFSEdim population. Apoptotic
leukemia cells co-cultured with MSCs are defined as
annexin V+/CD45+ cells. Apoptosis was expressed as
specific apoptosis [14]:

Statistical analyses
Multiple samples were treated and the results were
expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, using twosided Student’s t-test. EC50 was calculated by Calcusyn
software. The combination index (CI), determined using
the Chou-Talalay method [53] and Calcusyn software,
was expressed as the mean of CI values obtained at ED50,
ED75, and ED90. CI < 1 was considered synergistic. PCR
was done in duplicates and results expressed as mean ±
standard derivation.
