ABSTRACT
Recently, we found that sMEK1 effectively regulates pro-apoptotic activity
when combined with a traditional chemotherapeutic drug. Therefore, combinational
therapeutic strategies targeting critical molecular and cellular mechanisms are
urgently required. In this present work, we evaluated whether sMEK1 enhanced the
pro-apoptotic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian carcinoma cells. Combined
with a chemotherapeutic drug, sMEK1 showed an additive effect on the suppression of
ovarian cancer cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and regulating
related gene expression levels or protein activities. In addition, the phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was strongly
inhibited by the combined treatment, showing de-repression of the tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC) and suppression of ras homolog enriched in the brain (Rheb) and
mTOR and raptor in aggressive ovarian carcinoma cells and mouse xenograft models.
Treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase
(S6K) and 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), two critical downstream targets of the mTORsignaling pathway. Furthermore, both sMEK1 and paclitaxel significantly inhibited
the expression of signaling components downstream of S6K/4E-BP, such as hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), both
in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our data suggest that the combination of sMEK1 and
paclitaxel is a promising and effective targeted therapy for chemotherapy-resistant
or recurrent ovarian cancers.

INTRODUCTION

microtubules and prevents division in malignant ovarian,
lung, breast, and prostate tumor cells [1, 2]. It also acts
through the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest, with
subsequent mitotic arrest and apoptosis [3]. In addition,
paclitaxel is considered one of the most clinically active
chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of a variety
of solid tumors, including gynecologic cancers [4, 5].
However, its effects are limited by drug resistance. Several
biological functions/mechanisms of drug resistance in
tumors have been postulated, including high expression
of multidrug-resistance (MDR) proteins, inhibition of

Ovarian cancer shows the highest mortality rates
of all malignant gynecologic tumors, and its prognosis
is very poor. Thus, new and effective combinational
forms of therapy that target specific signaling pathways
are required. Chemotherapy is one of the most widely
used treatments for tumor patients. For example,
chemotherapy can generally be used in addition to other
modalities, such as surgery or radiation therapy. Paclitaxel
is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug that binds to

apoptotic signaling pathways, and enhanced DNA repair
[6-8]. Apoptotic cell death is generally characterized
by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and
cell shrinkage. Apoptosis is an important mechanism of
drug-stimulated cancer cell death, with the sensitivity to
apoptosis of the various types of carcinoma cell being a
major determinant of chemotherapy and radiation efficacy.
Paclitaxel treatment itself can regulate the expression and
mediate post-translational modifications of the Bcl-2
family proteins [9-12].
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
a major component of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
that is frequently dysregulated in various types of cancer,
including ovarian cancer. Disordered mTOR activity has
been reported to be associated with some malignant and
resistant cancers. Targeting the mTOR signaling pathway
could represent an effective tumor treatment strategy
[13]. The mTOR kinase forms two distinct functional
complexes known as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which regulate cell
proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, autophagy, and
protein synthesis. mTORC1 responds to multiple signaling
inputs by modulating its upstream regulators, such as
tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/2), and by
direct phosphorylation of the mTORC1 component, Raptor
[14-16]. In the mTOR-signaling pathway, ras homolog
enriched in the brain (Rheb) guanosine triphosphatase
(GTPase) are major regulators of mTORC1 activity. Upon
activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates a number of proteins
involved in protein biosynthesis, including ribosomal
protein S6 kinases 1 and 2 (S6K1/2) and the eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) [17]. In
addition, mTORC2 plays an important role in organization
of the actin cytoskeleton [14]. These effects are modulated
by the mTORC2 dependent phosphorylation of protein
kinase family members, such as protein kinase B (PKB)
and protein kinase C (PKC).
sMEK1 tumor suppressor, termed the protein
phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 3 (PP4R3), is a highly
conserved protein phosphatase family of serine/threonine
phosphatases associated with sensitivity to traditional
anti-cancer drugs [18, 19]. sMEK1 plays an important
role in cellular biological functions, such as microtubule
organization, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, growth,
DNA damage checkpoint, TNF signaling, and PI3K/
Akt signaling [20-22]. sMEK1 interacts with various
intracellular proteins, such as BLU tumor suppressor [23],
histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) [24], the insulin receptor
substrate 4 (IRS-4) [25], and the targets of rapamycin
(TOR) [26]. Recently, Byun et al., [22] reported that
sMEK1 could effectively regulate the pro-apoptotic
activity of gemcitabine by upregulating p53 expression.
In addition, the expression of sMEK1 was significantly
suppressed in ovarian and cervical tumor patients, as well
as tumor cell lines, while also being hypermethylated [23].
In this report, we explored whether sMEK1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitizes cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced cell death and
assessed the underlying biological mechanisms. sMEK1
co-treatment could further increase paclitaxel-induced
cancer cell death by enhancing apoptosis and inhibiting the
mTOR-S6K/4E-BP signaling pathways more effectively.
Furthermore, the expression levels of HIF-1α and VEGF,
which are located downstream of mTOR, were decreased
markedly. Our results suggest that sMEK1 has a novel
biological function; i.e., further activation of paclitaxelstimulated apoptosis via the concomitant inhibition of the
Akt-Rheb and mTORC1-S6K/4E-BP signaling pathways.

RESULTS
Treatment with sMEK1 plus a chemotherapeutic
drug significantly enhances cytotoxicity to ovarian
carcinoma cells
To examine the cytotoxic effects of sMEK1 and
paclitaxel on OVCAR-3 carcinoma cells, cell proliferation
was analyzed in the presence of sMEK1 (0.3–1.5 µg) or
paclitaxel (5–50 µM). We also examined the combined
effects of paclitaxel and sMEK1. As shown in Fig. 1A,
sMEK1 and paclitaxel enhanced apoptotic cell death in a
dose-dependent manner as evidenced by a ~40% reduction
in cell viability by 0.6-µg sMEK1 (left panel) and 50%
reduction by 20 µM paclitaxel (right panel). In order to
check the combination effects, when OVCAR-3 carcinoma
cells were transfected with sMEK1 (0.6 µg) and treated
with paclitaxel (20 µM), cell viability was reduced by
>70%, whereas a 20–30% less reduction in cell viability
resulted from transfection with sMEK1 or cells treated
with paclitaxel alone (Fig. 1B, left panel). In addition,
we investigated the possible additive or synergistic
effects of sMEK1 and paclitaxel on apoptosis using an
annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-based fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) system. As shown in Fig.
1B (right panel), co-treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel
additively decreased cell survival, suggesting that this
combination could yield a greater anti-cancer effect than
either treatment alone. Similar results were found in other
ovarian cancer cell lines, including 2774 and SKOV-3
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
The effects of sMEK1 and paclitaxel on carcinoma
cells were associated with the induction of apoptosis, as
validated by morphological and biochemical analyses,
such as DAPI staining, caspase-3 activity, and PARP
cleavage. As shown in Fig. 2A, after transfection with
sMEK1 or treatment with paclitaxel alone compared to
the control transfectant (empty vector only), ~39–50% of
the cells displayed fragmented nuclei, while no change in
cell morphology was observed in control cells. Treatment
with a combination of sMEK1 and paclitaxel resulted
in a significantly increased number of cells harboring

fragmented DNA.
Because caspase activation is an important cause
of apoptotic cell death, we examined caspase-3 activity,
a critical effector protease of apoptosis. Caspase-3 was
activated in sMEK1-transfected and paclitaxel-treated
cells compared to control cells (empty vector only).
Caspase-3 activation was greater in cells subjected to
sMEK1 plus paclitaxel treatment than in cells subjected
to either single treatment. These results suggested that
sMEK1 and paclitaxel in combination are more effective
against human ovarian carcinoma (Fig. 2B). Next, cells
were treated with z-DEVD-fmk, a specific inhibitor of
caspase-3, for 3 h before transient sMEK1 transfection,

followed by incubation for 48 h. Treatment with z-DEVDfmk protected the sMEK1-expressing and paclitaxeltreated cells from apoptotic death. Moreover, DEVD-fmk
treatment in combination with sMEK1 plus paclitaxel
suppressed caspase-3 activation almost completely
(Fig. 2C). Thus, ectopic sMEK1 expression additively
enhanced paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 activation in
carcinoma cells. We next examined the cleavage of PARP
by immunoblotting. As presented in Fig. 2D, PARP
cleavage was induced more strongly by co-treatment
with sMEK1 and paclitaxel compared to sMEK1 or
paclitaxel alone. Taken together, our results indicated that
sMEK1 contributed to the anti-tumor effect by promoting

with sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK plus paclitaxel showed
significantly inhibited migration. Thus, sMEK1 or
paclitaxel treatment potently suppresses cell migration in
vitro.
To clarify the biological and molecular mechanism
underlying the reduction in cell viability due to sMEK1 or
paclitaxel, cell-cycle-related protein levels were examined
using Western blotting. The cell cycle was then examined
using a PI-based FACS analysis system in OVCAR-3
carcinoma cells treated with sMEK1, paclitaxel, or both.
p16, p27, cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin B1, and CDK1 are
key regulators of cell cycle progression. Upon sMEK1
transfection alone, the expression levels of cyclin D1
and CDK4, which are associated with the transition
from G1 to S phase, were decreased markedly compared
to paclitaxel alone (Fig. 3B). Following treatment with
paclitaxel alone, the expression levels of cyclin B1 and
CDK1, which are associated with the transition from G2
to M phase, were suppressed markedly (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3B

Cell cycle progression and expression of cell-cycleassociated proteins in carcinoma cells
Wound healing is a complex and protracted process
of tissue repair and remodeling in response to injury.
These processes involve coordinated cell migration, cell
activation and cell division. To further evaluate the effect
of sMEK1 and paclitaxel on the biological processes
of cancer cells, cell migration was assessed using a
wound-healing assay system. A fixed-width scratch was
created in a cell monolayer at 24 h post-transfection with
sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK1 and paclitaxel, and cell
migration was monitored using a digital camera coupled
to a microscope. Fig. 3A shows that at 24 h post-woundhealing, the control (empty vector only) cells migrated
and almost filled the wounded area, while cells treated

efficiencies, the luciferase activities were normalized by co-transfection with a Renilla luciferase plasmid vector. The experiment was
repeated three times independently; means ± SD are shown. *P<0.05.

and 3C show significant reductions in cyclin D1 and cyclin
B1 levels and increases in p16 and p27 levels, which
are consistent with G1 (sMEK1 alone) or G2 (paclitaxel
alone) phase arrest of cell cycle progression, respectively.
Upon combined treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel,
the expression levels of the CDK inhibitors p16 and p27,
which are associated with the interruption of cell cycle
progression in the G1 and G2/M phases, were increased
markedly (Fig. 3B, C). Our findings indicate that sMEK1
and paclitaxel additively inhibit cell proliferation by
inducing G1 or G2 phase arrest.

and Bcl-2 expression levels were decreased markedly
in sMEK1 and paclitaxel-treated cells. In addition, NFκB levels were reduced significantly. In contrast, p53
protein levels were increased considerably in sMEK1transfected cells and paclitaxel-treated cells, as were Bax
and p21 levels. In addition, the p21 and p53 promoter
activities were upregulated markedly, while NF-κB and
Bcl-2 activities were downregulated gradually following
treatment with sMEK1, paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus
paclitaxel (Fig. 4B and C, left panel). Subsequently, we
isolated RNA from independent samples and performed
RT-PCR. p21 and p53 mRNA levels were increased
significantly in cells treated with sMEK1, paclitaxel, and
sMEK1 plus paclitaxel compared with the controls. In
contrast, NF-κB and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were decreased
significantly (Fig. 4B and C, right panel). Therefore,
sMEK1 or paclitaxel may enhance G1 or G2 cell cycle
arrest by stimulating transcription of p21.

Effect of sMEK1 and paclitaxel on the
expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, and
the regulation of the Bcl-2 family and NF-κB
promoter activity
The tumor suppressor p53 and the NF-κB protein
are major regulators of the signaling pathways of cell
proliferation and apoptotic cell death [27, 28], and are
considered key mediators of the Bcl-2 proteins [29, 30].
Expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
in OVCAR-3 cells was monitored following treatment
with sMEK1 or paclitaxel. As shown in Fig. 4A, Bcl-xL

treated with control (vector only), sMEK1 plasmid, paclitaxel, or sMEK1 plus paclitaxel, including wortmannin, or LY294002 as a PI3K
inhibitor, respectively. After 24 h, cells were harvested and whole lysates were subjected to Western blotting to detect phosphorylation
of the PI3K protein. PI3K was used to verify equal sample loading. The experiment was repeated three times independently; data are
shown as means ± SD. *P<0.05 compared to the control (empty vector only). (B-C) After treatment with the indicated agents, protein
extract samples (50 µg) were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and levels of the following proteins were determined by immunoblotting
using the indicated antibodies: phospho-Akt(Thr308), phospho-Akt(Ser473), phospho-S6K(Thr389), phospho-4E-BP(Thr70), phospho-PDK1(Ser241), phospho-TSC-2(Ser1462), phospho-mTOR(Ser2448), phospho-Raptor(Ser863), phospho-Rictor(Thr135), Rheb, VEGF, and HIF-1.
Non-phosphorylated proteins were used as equal loading controls (indicated as Akt, S6K, 4E-BP, PDK-1, TSC-2, mTOR, Raptor, and
Rictor; or β-actin for Rheb, VEGF, and HIF-1α). Three independent experiments were conducted in triplicate.

migration, and metabolism. We first determined whether
sMEK1 and paclitaxel could inhibit PI3K activity
in OVCAR-3 carcinoma cells. After treatment with
control (vector only), sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK1
plus paclitaxel, cell lysates were immunoblotted using
anti-phospho-p85 and anti-p85 antibodies, respectively.
After treatment with sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK1
plus paclitaxel, phosphorylation of PI3K was inhibited
significantly. This inhibitory activity was comparable to
that of two well-known PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and
LY294002 (Fig. 5A). PI3K inhibition in the ovarian cells
resulted in inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, a major
downstream target of PI3K. Akt activates mTOR through
a variety of cellular mechanisms, and thus regulates
apoptosis-associated proteins [31]. Generally, mTOR
inhibitors play important roles in regulating the signaling
pathways involved in cell cycle progression. As expected,
sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK1 plus paclitaxel inhibited
Akt, S6K, and 4E-BP phosphorylation (Figure 5B), the
latter being one of the best-characterized targets of the

mTOR complex. Rapamycin was used as a positive control
of inhibition of mTOR downstream signaling. These
results indicated that sMEK1 and paclitaxel modulated
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
Next, we examined the involvement of
phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), TSC-2,
Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor, which are up- or down-stream
regulators of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Activated PI3K
recruits PDK-1 and Akt to the plasma membrane. Akt can
be phosphorylated in both a PDK-1-dependent manner and
through the direct phosphorylation of mTORC2. Upon
treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel, phosphorylation of
PDK-1 on Ser241 was decreased significantly (Fig. 5C).
Akt may also act indirectly on mTOR by regulating the
inhibition by TSC-1/TSC-2 of mTOR activity. As shown
in Fig. 5C, treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel decreased
inhibitory phosphorylation of TSC-2 on Thr1462, which
may lead to mTOR inhibition [31, 32]. As one of the key
components of the PI3K pathway, mTOR exists in two
different complexes; mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1/

Raptor phosphorylation was markedly inhibited by
sMEK1 and paclitaxel, whereas that of mTORC2/
Rictor was unchanged (Fig. 5C). In the mTOR signaling
pathways, mTORC1/Raptor activation plays an important
role in regulating translation and cell growth [33, 34].
Specifically, S6K and 4E-BP phosphorylation regulate
protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis,
including production of the VEGF and HIF-1α proteins.
Treatment with both sMEK1 and paclitaxel significantly
decreased VEGF and HIF-1α expression, the latter being
one of the best-characterized targets of the mTOR complex
in protein synthesis (Fig. 5C). Therefore, sMEK1 and
paclitaxel inhibited the growth of ovarian carcinoma cells
by inducing apoptotic death via the Akt-Rheb/mTORC1S6K/4E-BP-dependent signaling pathways.

shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, treatment with sMEK1,
paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel significantly
abrogated VEGF-induced tube formation. These results
indicated that sMEK1 plus paclitaxel exerted a strong antiangiogenic effect compared to either agent alone in the in
vitro angiogenesis system.
Tumor tissue paraffin sections were visualized
using H&E staining for histological analysis. The control
group displayed high-grade carcinoma with an irregular
cell distribution. In contrast, sections from the sMEK1,
paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel-treated groups
exhibited large areas of late-apoptotic or necrotic cells.
Subsequently, to explore whether sMEK1, paclitaxel, or
sMEK1 plus paclitaxel induces apoptotic cell death, we
evaluated caspase-3 activation by immunohistochemistry.
As expected, sMEK1 plus paclitaxel as well as sMEK1
or paclitaxel alone significantly increased the caspase-3
activity in a xenograft tumor compared with the control
group (Fig. 6C). In addition, tissues from each treatment
group and the control group were stained for the cell
proliferation marker PCNA. PCNA expression in the
sMEK1, paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel treatment
groups was significantly lower than that in the control
group (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that sMEK1 plus
paclitaxel suppresses tumor growth by inducing apoptosis
in vivo.

Treatment with sMEK1 and paclitaxel inhibited
the growth of human ovarian carcinoma cells in
nude mice
The antitumor effects of treatment with sMEK1
plus paclitaxel and sMEK1 alone in vivo were measured
in ovarian tumor xenografts. As shown in Fig. 6A, the
tumor volume of the control group increased after 12
days. In contrast, tumor volumes in the sMEK1- and
paclitaxel-alone groups were significantly lower than
that in the control group. In addition, the combination
therapy suppressed ovarian cancer tumor growth by
more than 60%. Next, to confirm whether sMEK1 plus
paclitaxel induced apoptotic cell death via the Akt/Rheb/
mTORC1-S6K/4E-BP-dependent signaling pathways in
carcinoma cells in vivo, ovarian-tumor-containing mice
were sacrificed after each treatment and tumor tissues
were subjected to Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6B
(upper panel), mTORC1/Raptor phosphorylation was
suppressed markedly by sMEK1 or paclitaxel, as well
as by sMEK1 plus paclitaxel, whereas that of mTORC2/
Rictor was unchanged. Similar results were observed in
three independent in vitro experiments. Subsequently, to
confirm the anti-angiogenic effects of sMEK1, paclitaxel,
and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel in vivo, we enumerated blood
vessels by immunohistochemical staining for CD31
(PECAM-1). Tumor sections from sMEK1, paclitaxel,
and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel-treated mice exhibited a
2.5–5 fold reduction in the number of blood vessels (Fig.
6B, lower panel). These data demonstrated that sMEK1,
paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel inhibited tumor
angiogenesis by decreasing VEGF and HIF-1α expression
in vivo. We next determined the anti-angiogenic effects of
sMEK1, paclitaxel, and sMEK1 plus paclitaxel on VEGFinduced capillary-like tube structure formation using an
in vitro angiogenesis model. VEGF application led to the
formation of extended and strong capillary-like tubule
structures, which comprised a considerably larger number
of cells compared with non-VEGF-induced cells. As

DISCUSSION
We reported previously that sMEK1 can control
apoptotic cell death by upregulating p53 expression and
inhibiting Akt/mTOR [22]. The tumor suppressor sMEK1
functionally regulates apoptosis through mTOR regulation.
Further studies are required to fully understand the roles
of downstream components that promote death of cancer
cells. In this study, the combination of the traditional
chemotherapeutic paclitaxel with sMEK1 had an additive
effect on inducing G1 or G2 phase arrest during cell cycle
progression (Fig. 3). Our data also indicate that sMEK1 is
an important modulator of mTORC1-dependent apoptotic
cell death under physiological/biological conditions.
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical role in
apoptosis. Phosphorylation of major factors in the mTORsignaling pathway, such as PI3K, Akt, PDK-1, and TSC-2,
was decreased by treatment with paclitaxel plus sMEK1
(Fig. 5). Previous studies have shown that the inhibitory
effect of TSC-1/TSC-2 on mTORC1 is modulated by TSC2 inactivation of a Ras family small GTPase known as
Rheb (Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain) [34]. Our results
confirmed that the combination of these two compounds
additively decreased Rheb expression (Fig. 5C). Activated
mTOR regulates the phosphorylation of 4E-BP and S6K.
Specifically, S6K is the best-examined target of mTORC1.
S6K, which is a mitogen-activated serine/threonine kinase,
is an important regulator of protein synthesis, and thus
plays a key role in cell proliferation and survival [35, 36].

Shafer et al., [37] reported that paclitaxel alone suppresses
phosphorylation of the S6K protein, with the greatest
effect observed after 72 h of exposure, which is consistent
with our results (Fig. 5B). The combination of sMEK1
and paclitaxel strongly decreased phosphorylation of the
4E-BP protein, an essential factor for protein synthesis
(Fig. 5B). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays
a critical role in cancer cell survival by regulating the
transcription of various genes involved in angiogenesis,
glucose metabolism and survival [38]. Walmsley et al.,
[39] reported that neutrophil survival is mediated by
HIF-1α-dependent NF-κB mRNA expression and activity
in hypoxia. Along with HIF-1α, its downstream target,
VEGF, plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and is
considered an attractive chemotherapeutic target [40].
In conclusion, this study systematically analyzed
the anti-tumor effects of the sMEK1 tumor suppressor
protein in combination with paclitaxel, a traditional
chemotherapeutic agent, using an in vitro and in vivo
molecular/biochemical system. Our results characterize
a detailed signaling pathway through which the
combination of sMEK1 and paclitaxel induces apoptotic
cell death by enhancing caspase-3 activation and PARP
cleavage through the suppression of Akt-Rheb/mTORC1S6K/4E-BP-dependent signaling pathways in ovarian
tumorigenesis. In addition, this effect occurs through
cellular communication with rapid inhibition of HIF-1α
and VEGF expression. Importantly, our results suggest a
possible molecular target for treatment with sMEK1 and
paclitaxel of certain malignant tumors, which may have
future clinical applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DAPI staining for DNA fragmentation

Cell growth assay
Cell viability after treatment with sMEK1
plus
paclitaxel
was
determined
using
the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, in triplicate. Briefly, cells
were plated at a density of 3.0×104 per well in 96-well
microtiter plates. After 24 h, cells were collected by
trypsin treatment, rinsed with PBS, and replaced with
fresh medium, after which 20 µl of MTT solution (Sigma,
5 mg/ml) were added to each well. Plates were then
incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C. The amounts
of MTT-formazan generated were measured using a
microplate reader at 570-nm absorbance. The results are
representative of three independent experiments.

OVCAR-3 cells were seeded on six-well plates
and treated with control (empty vector only), sMEK1,
paclitaxel, or sMEK1 plus paclitaxel. To observe their
morphology, nuclei were fixed with methanol and stained
for 15 min with 4, 6′-diamidino-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 1 µg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim; Mannheim,
Germany), rinsed twice with PBS, and visualized under a
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss; Switzerland).

Culture conditions, animals, chemicals, reagents
and antibodies
Human ovarian carcinoma cells (OVCAR-3,
MDAH-2774 and SKOV-3) obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
maintained in DMEM media (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with either 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), including penicillin
(100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml), in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Specific
pathogen-free BALB/c-nu/nu mice (5–6 weeks old) were
supplied by Orientbio (Sungnam, Korea). All animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Research Institute
of the National Cancer Center. z-DEVD-fmk caspase-3
inhibitor was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Other traditional chemotherapeutic drugs and chemicals
were obtained from Sigma. The primary antibodies used
in this study were anti-sMEK1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK),

Substrate-based caspase-3 and PARP activity
analysis
Caspase activity was determined as described
previously [41]. Briefly, 5.5×105 cells were rinsed with
cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer and left for 20
min on ice. The lysate was collected by centrifugation at
14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were
collected. Caspase-3 activity was incubated for 1 h at 37°C
with specific fluorometric substrates containing z-DEVDfmk and measured using a SpectraMax 340 microplate
reader (Molecular Devices). Each individual measurement

Luciferase reporter assay

was repeated three times. PARP cleavage was assessed as
described previously [42].

In vitro p21, p53, NF-κB and Bcl-2 promoter
activities were evaluated as described previously [45].
Briefly, cells at 85% confluency were transfected with
the indicated reporter plasmids. After lysis in RIPA
buffer, lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15
min at 14,000 rpm and cell extracts were treated with
the luciferase substrate reagent at room temperature for
30 min according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then,
a 5-µl aliquot of each sample was quantitated using the
MicroLumat Plus LB96V luminometer.

Western blotting
After transfection/treatment, cells were collected,
washed in PBS, centrifuged, and lysed in a buffer
containing protease inhibitor (50 mM Tris, pH 7.2,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 µg/ml leupeptin,
1 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 200 µg/ml
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were
subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA). After blocking, the membranes were
incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. The
membranes were washed three times in wash buffer
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Protein bands were detected using
the ECL detection system.

P21, P53, NF-κB and BCL-2 mRNA levels by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol total RNA
isolation system (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total
RNA were reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using
a cDNA synthesis kit (Promega). PCR was performed in a
final reaction volume of 50 µl containing specific primers
synthesized by MACROGEN (Seoul, Korea) targeting
the human P21, P53, NF-κB, and BCL-2 genes (P21;
forward: 5′-GCGATGGAACTTCGACTTTGT-3′ reverse:
5′-GGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGAT-3′, P53; forward:
5′-CAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTAC-3′ reverse:
5′-CTATGTCGAAAAGTGTTTCTGTCATC-3′, NF-κB;
forward: 5′-TCCGTTATGTATGTGAAGGC-3′ reverse:

the
human
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
gene
(GAPDH;
forward:
5’-GTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCT-3’
reverse:
5’-TGAGGAGGGGAGATTCAGTG-3’). GAPDH was
used as the internal control. After incubation at 95°C for 5
min, PCR was performed for 25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min,
56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and the products were
visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration was evaluated using the woundhealing assay as described previously [43]. Briefly, cells
were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5×105 per
well. A scratch wound was introduced using a pipette tip.
The wounded cells were washed three times with PBS
and DMEM medium with 10% FBS, and covered with
sMEK1, paclitaxel, or sMEK1 plus paclitaxel containing
medium or the control (empty vector only) medium.
Images of the wound areas were taken at 0 and 24 h using
a Leica DFL290 camera and the percentage of closure
was measured using the Leica application suite software
(Leica Microsystems). The results are representative of
three independent experiments.

Cell cycle progression analysis and annexin V
staining
Cell cycle distributions were determined by
propidium iodide (PI) staining, as described previously
[44]. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by staining with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V
and propidium iodide (PI). Briefly, cells treated with the
control (expression vector only), sMEK1, paclitaxel, or
sMEK1 plus paclitaxel were collected, rinsed with icecold PBS, and then resuspended in binding buffer. After
incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the cells were incubated for
15 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
annexin V, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim), and then subjected to
flow cytometry analysis (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). Each individual measurement was
repeated three times.

Briefly, 6-week-old female BALB/c-nu/nu mice
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1.6×106
OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. When tumors reached
~100 mm3 in volume on day 14, mice were subjected to
intraperitoneal injection of each agent, which was repeated
every 3 days for 27 days. Tumor size was measured every
other day in three dimensions using calipers. Mice were
sacrificed 1 day after the final injection. Tumors were then
excised and prepared for immunohistochemistry (IHC).
