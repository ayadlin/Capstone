Abstract
Doxorubicin treatment was found to augment the expression of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibulin-1 in cultured
human breast cancer cell lines and in MDA-MB-361 tumors
grown in athymic mice. Doxorubicin was also found to augment
tumor expression of the fibulin-1–binding proteins fibronectin
and laminin-1. Growth of breast cancer cell lines on Matrigel,
an ECM extract containing fibulin-1 and laminin-1, resulted in
lower levels of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis as compared
with controls. Moreover, tumors formed by injection of athymic
mice with MDA-MB-361 cells mixed with Matrigel were
significantly more doxorubicin resistant and displayed lower
levels of apoptosis compared with those that formed in the
absence of Matrigel. Monoclonal antibodies against fibulin-1
reversed Matrigel-dependent doxorubicin resistance. Furthermore, small interfering RNA–mediated suppression of fibulin-1
expression in breast cancer cells resulted in a 10-fold increase
in doxorubicin sensitivity as compared with control cells.
Together, these findings point to a role for fibulin-1 in breast
cancer chemoresistance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4271–7]

Introduction
Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy has improved
the probability of survival of breast cancer patients by 10% to 15%.
Nonetheless, the incomplete understanding of the biological
mechanisms underlying chemoresistance has hampered further
improvement in the treatment and outcome of breast carcinoma.
To date, the biological classification of tumors as ‘‘responsive’’ or
‘‘nonresponsive’’ to treatment remains controversial, and even
extensively studied conventional pathobiological markers of breast
cancer such as hormone receptors, grade, p53, and HER-2 are not
useful in predicting tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy (1).
This likely reflects the multifactorial origin of chemoresistance in
most solid tumors.
Mechanisms involved in drug resistance include the presence of
a range of drug transporters (such as P-glycoprotein or multidrug
resistance–associated protein); changes in the expression of
topoisomerases; alterations in metabolic pathways that influence
drug metabolism, DNA repair, or apoptosis; delivery and distribution of anticancer drugs to tumor cells; imbalance of the ratio of

bax to bcl-2; high levels of constitutive nuclear factor-nB activity,
cyclin D1 overexpression, and the microenvironment (2–6).
Recent evidence increasingly points to the important role of
stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the success of
chemotherapy (7). Indeed, the disruption of integrin-mediated cellECM interactions can influence cancer cell sensitivity to apoptosis
and affect drug resistance (1). Several studies have shown that
small-cell lung cancer cells (8), myeloma cells (9), glioma cells (10),
chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (11), lymphoma (12), uveal
melanoma (13), and ovarian (14), bladder (15), and colon (16)
carcinomas were protected from the apoptosis induced by various
anticancer drugs when the cells were plated on ECM proteins such
as fibronectin, laminin-1, and collagens, which directly bind
integrin receptors. However, it has remained unclear whether
other ECM proteins including those that do not directly engage
integrins also contribute to chemoresistance. Among the latter
proteins are the fibulins, a family of six proteins thought to
function as bridges in the organization of ECM supramolecular
structures (17). Fibulin-1 (FBLN-1), the prototype member of this
family, has four splice variants (17) and binds to many ECM
proteins, including fibronectin, laminin-1, fibrinogen, nidogen, and
the proteoglycans aggrecan and versican (18). Several studies have
reported that FBLN-1 is expressed in various human neoplasias
and it is implicated in processes such as invasion, motility, and
in vivo tumor growth (19–22). We recently showed that FBLN-1 is a
breast cancer–restricted antigen aberrantly expressed in 35% of 528
breast cancer specimens analyzed (23); it induces both specific
B-cell– and T-cell–mediated responses in breast cancer patients
(23, 24); and it can be exploited as a tool for early detection of
breast cancers (25). Here, we report that FBLN-1 acts to promote
breast cancer cell survival during doxorubicin treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human breast carcinoma cell lines SKBR-3, MCF-7, MDA-MB157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and MDAMB-175 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The MDA-MB-435 cell line, which shows both breast-specific and
melanocyte-specific markers (26), was also obtained from ATCC. Cell lines
were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Sigma Chemical) and L-glutamine in a
humidified chamber (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37jC. Human breast tumor MCF7-DXR (doxorubicin-resistant variant) and MCF-7B (parental) cell lines were
kindly provided by Elena Monti [Department of Structural and Functional
Biology, Section of Pharmacology, University of Insubria, Busto Arsizio (VA),
Italy; ref. 27].
Antibodies. The mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to human FBLN-1,
P5B1, P3B4, P1B2, MEM-2, and 3A11 have previously been described
(28, 29). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human laminin-1 and human
fibronectin and mouse mAbs against a-actin and vinculin were purchased
from Sigma Chemical.

Indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The cytoplasm-associated form of FBLN-1 was detected with
the mAb MEM-2 in doxorubicin-treated and untreated permeabilized tumor
cells after fixation and permeabilization with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD
Biosciences PharMingen) as described (23).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Tumor specimens from
doxorubicin-treated and untreated athymic mice were minced, lysed for
1 h on ice in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholic acid]
containing protease inhibitors, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride,
and 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, and specifically processed as described (23).
Specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (GE Healthcare Amersham).
Autoradiographic signals were measured using a Bio-Rad scanning
densitometer (Bio-Rad, ChemiDoc/XRS). Data were acquired and analyzed
using Quantity One v 4.6.1 software. The expression of proteins and
transcripts was assessed relative to housekeeping gene expression in the
given sample.
In-gel tryptic digestion, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and peptide mass fingerprinting. In-gel digestion was done following the protocol of Shevchenko et al.
(30, 31) with modification. Reflector matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectra were acquired on a Voyager
STR (Applied Biosystems) and used to search nonredundant protein
sequence databases with Aldente and ProFound software.5
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RNA was extracted with RNAzol B
isolation solvent (Tel-Test, Inc.). Reverse transcription was carried out at
42jC for 60 min using 2 Ag of total RNA, 75 pmol of oligo(dT) primer,
0.5 mmol/L of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 50 units of Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was done in
a total volume of 50 AL using the following sequence-specific primer pairs:
FBLN-1, (+) primer 5¶-CCGGAGTGGACGCGGATGTCCTCC-3¶ and ()
primer 5¶-CCTCCAGCTGGCTGTGGCAGCACT-3¶ (expected product
149 bp) and (+) primer 5¶-ATATGCTACGGAATCCAAAG-3¶ and () primer
5¶-TTGATGCATGTATGCCCAAT-3¶ (expected product 821 bp; upstream and
downstream oligonucleotide primers both taken from a region of fibulin
cDNA common to the four isoforms). After an initial denaturation step
at 95jC for 3 min, PCR was carried out at 95jC for 1 min, 56jC for 2 min
and 72jC for 2 min for 30 cycles, followed by final extension at 72jC
for 10 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
transcripts were amplified in a 20-cycle PCR using (+) primer 5¶-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3¶ and () primer 5¶-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3¶.
Cell treatments. Evaluations of FBLN-1 transcript and protein
expression in response to chemotherapy were done on breast tumor cell
lines first grown at 70% confluence and then treated with doxorubicin
(Pharmacia Upjohn) or vehicle for 72 h. The following growth inhibition
concentrations (IC30) of doxorubicin were used: 122 nmol/L for MCF-7, 114
nmol/L for SKBR-3, and 132 nmol/L for MDA-MB-157, as previously
calculated (32).
ELISA analysis of ECM-associated FBLN-1. ELISA was used to quantify
levels of FBLN-1 associated with ECM. Cell lines were treated as above, the
culture medium was removed, and cells were repeatedly washed in PBS.
After lysing cells by two incubations in 20 mmol/L NH4OH for 10 min, the
plates were extensively washed with PBS and then with distilled water and
allowed to air dry, as described (33). The ECM proteins were recovered in
collection buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 100 mmol/L
h-mercaptoethanol]. After 15 min at 37jC, the fluid was collected with a cell
scraper. The recovered ECM-associated proteins were used as targets for
ELISA as described (34).
Silencing of FBLN-1 by small interfering RNA transfection. MCF-7
cells (3  105 per well) were seeded in six-well plates and grown to 60% to
80% confluence and the cell layers washed with serum-free medium. The

cell layers were transfected either with a pool of two small interfering RNA
(siRNA) oligonucleotides specific for human FBLN-1 ( final concentration,
50 nmol/L; Dharmacon) or a pool of control RNA duplexes (Dharmacon)
using transIT-TKO transfection reagent (10 AL/well; Mirus). After overnight
incubation at 37jC, culture medium was replaced with fresh complete
medium containing 10% FCS. Cells were harvested after 48 h, processed for
immunofluorescence staining, and treated with escalating doses of
doxorubicin for cytotoxicity assays or solubilized for Western blot analysis
of FBLN-1 silencing.
Proliferation assay. To study doxorubicin sensitivity of FBLN-1–
silenced tumor cells, 3  104 MCF-7 cells per well were seeded in 96-well
plates in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, transfected with FBLN-1–
specific siRNA sequences or with control reagents for 48 h, and treated with
escalating doses of doxorubicin (six replicates for each drug dose for each
cell treatment). Doxorubicin was removed after 72 h and cell proliferation
was assessed as described (35).
In vitro apoptosis assays. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDAMB-361, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453,
and MDA-MB-468 in 2 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% FCS were
seeded at 2  105 per well in six-well plates. Replicate cultures were set up
in wells precoated or not with a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences
PharMingen; 2 mL of a 1:5 dilution of Matrigel stock solution). In some
experiments, cells were seeded in the presence or absence of the FBLN-1
mAbs P3B4, P1B2, and P5B1, used individually or pooled. After 24 h,
doxorubicin (200 nmol/L) was added to replicate wells containing cells with
or without Matrigel. Apoptosis was evaluated after 72 h of doxorubicin
treatment by staining tumor cells with Annexin V-FITC and propidium
iodide as described (36) followed by flow cytometry analysis with
FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences PharMingen).
In vivo tumorigenesis assay. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c athymic
mice were purchased from Charles River. Care and use of the animals were
in accordance with institutional guidelines. Mice were injected s.c. with
1  106 MDA-MB-361 cells alone; 100 AL of Matrigel alone; cells and
Matrigel; cells and doxorubicin (7 mg/mL), administered i.p. at
72 h following tumor cell injection; or cells and Matrigel and doxorubicin,
with six mice in each group. Tumors were calibrated twice weekly for
58 days and tumor volume was calculated as 0.5  d21  d 2, where d 1 and d 2
are the larger and smaller diameters, respectively.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling assay and immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic cell death was
evaluated in paraffin-embedded sections of xenografts surgically removed
from athymic mice 10 days after s.c. injection of MDA-MB-361 cells,
suspended in 0.1 mL of Matrigel or in PBS. Doxorubicin treatment was done
72 h postinjection of cells. Control mice received no injection. A terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL)–based assay with the In situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD
(Roche), was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sections were analyzed as described (37) by acquiring digital images of
10 areas of each tissue section (at 400) on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope
(Carl Zeiss). Other immunohistochemical stainings were done on cryosections using a peroxidase-streptavidin method as previously described (23).
Statistical methods. The results of ELISA and of in vitro apoptosis assay
of cells cultured on Matrigel layer and involving the use of FBLN-1 mAbs
were evaluated by ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test.
Statistical significance was annotated as *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001. The
results of in vitro apoptosis assays of breast tumor cell lines and of MDAMB-361 tumor cells admixed or not with Matrigel and injected in mice
treated with doxorubicin were evaluated by two-tailed paired and unpaired
t test, respectively. Comparison of FBLN-1 gene expression levels in pre- and
post-doxorubicin treated breast cancers was evaluated by Mann-Whitney
test. Differences were considered significant at P V 0.05.

(Fig. 1C) revealed increased FBLN-1 expression at both the
transcript and protein levels in SKBR-3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-157,
and MCF-7-DXR (doxorubicin-resistant) tumor cells as compared
with untreated control cells. Densitometric analysis of the
expression data indicated that doxorubicin induced 2-, 3-, and
4-fold increases in the expression of FBLN-1 RNA and protein
(Fig. 1A). Because a 2-fold increase in FBLN-1 mRNA levels was also
observed after a nontoxic physical stress in the form of thermal
shock at 42jC for 4 h (Fig. 1A), the doxorubicin-induced increases
in FBLN-1 are likely related to drug-induced stress and not
to selection of drug-resistant cell variants. The MCF-7 doxorubicinresistant variant cell line was found to constitutively overexpress
FBLN-1 compared with the parental MCF-7B line (Fig. 1A–C).
To verify the findings from in vitro experiments, FBLN-1 levels
were evaluated in xenografts of MDA-MB-361 cells grown in

athymic mice treated with doxorubicin or buffer 72 h after tumor
cell injection. As shown in Fig. 2, FBLN-1 mRNA and protein were
increased by 2-fold in tumors grown in mice treated with
doxorubicin compared with controls (Fig. 2A and B). In addition,
immunohistochemistry analysis of the above-mentioned samples,
done with MEM-2 mAb, revealed higher levels of FBLN-1 in
surrounding tumor stroma after doxorubicin treatment compared
with control (Fig. 2C).
To ascertain whether the FBLN-1 observed in tumor specimens
was of tumor or host origin, FBLN-1 was immunoaffinity purified
from xenotransplants from untreated and doxorubicin-treated mice
and subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting based on MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. S1A, lanes 1 and 2,
respectively). Human FBLN-1 was identified with a high score in
the anti–FBLN-1 immunoprecipitates (see peptides listed with bold

characters, Supplementary Fig. S1B). Copurification of human and
mouse FBLN-1 could not be excluded. In fact, due to high sequence
similarity, a number of the tryptic peptides found in mass spectra
were consistent with FBLN-1 of both species (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
Additional analysis of ex vivo changes in ECM composition on
doxorubicin treatment revealed 3.6- and 2-fold increases in levels of

to doxorubicin treatment by remodeling the ECM in their
microenvironment.
Role of ECM in sensitivity to doxorubicin. To assess the role of
ECM proteins in sensitivity to doxorubicin, eight human breast
cancer cell lines were seeded on plastic or on a thin layer of
Matrigel, a solubilized basement membrane matrix preparation
containing high levels of FBLN-1 (Fig. 3A, inset, lane 2) and laminin-1,
as indicated in the BD Matrigel data sheet. The cells were then
exposed to doxorubicin (Fig. 3A). Overall, cells cultured on Matrigel
showed a significant reduction in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis
(P = 0.0007), with the level of protection ranging from 53% with
MDA-MB-453 cells to 95% with MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-361, MDAMB-468, and MDA-MB-175 cells.
Tumor volume measurements were made on the tumors from
athymic mice injected with MDA-MB-361 cells in the presence or
absence of Matrigel and doxorubicin treatment. The results show
that there were no differences in the volume of tumors from mice
injected with MDA-MB-361 cells alone or those from mice injected
with MDA-MB-361 cells mixed with Matrigel but not treated with
doxorubicin. By contrast, tumors from mice injected with MDAMB-361 cells and Matrigel and treated with doxorubicin were
significantly larger (P = 0.05) than tumors from mice injected with
MDA-MB-361 cells not combined with Matrigel but treated with
doxorubicin (Fig. 3B). Tissue sections from xenografts in mice
injected with MDA-MB-361 cells without Matrigel and treated with
doxorubicin also displayed TUNEL staining. By contrast, little or no
TUNEL staining was observed in tumor sections from mice
injected with MDA-MB-361 cells and Matrigel but not treated with
doxorubicin (Fig. 3C).
Inhibition of FBLN-1 restores sensitivity to doxorubicin. To
further support in vivo data, we next evaluated the effect of FBLN-1
antibodies on the observed protective effects of Matrigel on
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. MDA-MB-361 cells were cultured
on a thin Matrigel layer and treated with doxorubicin in the
presence or absence of FBLN-1 mAbs P3B4, P1B2, and P5B1 (used
individually or pooled together). As shown in Fig. 4, each FBLN-1
mAb produced a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the protective
effect of Matrigel against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, with the

highest level of cytotoxicity achieved with mAb P5B1 and the
pooled mAbs.
In another approach to test the consequence of suppressing
FBLN-1 expression on doxorubicin sensitivity, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with FBLN-1–specific siRNAs or control siRNA
duplexes and treated with doxorubicin for 72 h. Immunoblot
analysis revealed a 2-fold decrease in FBLN-1 expression in cells
transfected with a pool of FBLN-1 siRNAs (Fig. 5, lane 3) as
compared with cells transfected with a pool of control RNA
duplexes (Fig. 5, lane 4) or cells subjected to treatment with
transfection reagent alone (Fig. 5, lane 2). By comparison to
cells treated with medium alone, there was a 2.7-fold decrease in
FBLN-1 expression in cells transfected with FBLN-1–specific
siRNAs (Fig. 5, lane 1). FACS analysis using the same biological
samples confirmed the decrease in FBLN-1–silenced cells, as
reflected in decreased anti–FBLN-1 immunofluorescence intensity

and decreased percentage of FBLN-1–positive events (Table 1).
Dose dependence analysis of FBLN-1–silenced MCF-7 cells and
controls incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of
doxorubicin (0.002  106–9  106 mol/L) revealed an IC50
dose of 10  106 mol/L for siRNA-silenced cells as compared
with 1  106 mol/L for sham transfected cells or cells
incubated in medium, and compared with 0.8  106 mol/L for
MCF-7 cells transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (Table 1).
These data indicate that FBLN-1–silenced breast tumor cells
display a 10-fold increase in doxorubicin sensitivity compared
with controls.

Discussion
Findings presented here show a role for the ECM protein FBLN-1
in promoting resistance of breast cancer cells to the antitumor drug
doxorubicin. This conclusion was based on several findings
including those showing that FBLN-1 mAbs block the ability of
Matrigel to protect tumor cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of FBLN-1 expression by FBLN-1 siRNA
treatment markedly increased doxorubicin sensitivity of breast
cancer cells.
Findings from in vitro and in vivo experiments examining
FBLN-1 transcript and protein expression in doxorubicin-treated
breast cancer cells suggest that FBLN-1 is part of an early
response mechanism against drug-induced cell death. In fact,
breast cancer cell lines exhibited a marked increase in FBLN-1
mRNA levels, as well as intracellular and extracellular FBLN-1
protein production, on doxorubicin treatment at 72 h. Moreover,
analysis of xenografts showed a 2-fold increase in FBLN-1
expression levels in tumors grown in mice treated with
doxorubicin compared with controls. In addition to FBLN-1,
doxorubicin treatment also increased expression of the FBLN-1–
interacting ECM proteins, fibronectin and laminin-1, suggesting a
common mechanism activated by doxorubicin that increases
tumor cell transcription of functionally interrelated ECM components. It is possible that doxorubicin induces transcription factors
that act on the promoters of these ECM genes. Indeed, the
promoters of fibronectin, laminin-1, and FBLN-1 genes harbor
consensus binding sites for the transcription factor specificity
protein 1 (Sp1; ref. 38), and doxorubicin directly induces Sp1
activation (39). Mechanisms involving activation of p53 following
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage (40) seem to be less likely
because we observed FBLN-1 up-regulation in three breast cancer
cell lines differing in p53 status (wild-type in MCF-7, gain-offunction mutant in SKBR-3, and null in MDA-MB-157 cells).
Previous studies have suggested that long-term exposure of
cancer patients to antitumor drugs is associated with up-regulation
of ECM genes. Through analysis of a database (compiled by Perou

and coworkers)6 of breast cancer specimens isolated after
doxorubicin chemotherapy and pretherapy samples from the same
patients (41), we found increased expression of ECM genes in the
post drug treatment group and mainly of FBLN-1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, Jazaeri et al. (42) also found statistically
significant overrepresentation of ECM genes, including FBLN-1, in
ovarian tumors after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy
compared with that of primary tumors from different patients (42).
Taken together, these findings indicate that stromal-epithelial
interactions or ECM may be involved in acquired chemoresistance
of breast and ovarian cancers and that the link between FBLN-1 and
drug response is not necessarily exclusive to doxorubicin. As noted
by Damiano et al. (9), mechanisms of resistance selected by chronic
drug treatment may differ from mechanisms of cell survival after
acute exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, so that a selection
process might underlie the higher ECM gene expression in the
former studies. Thus, in a heterogeneous tumor population,
neoplastic cells with high and constitutive expression of ECM genes
that exert a ‘‘protective’’ effect against drug-induced death may
survive chemotherapy. However, our findings from short-term
treatment (72 h) of neoplastic cells with doxorubicin suggest a
direct modulation of FBLN-1 gene expression due to doxorubicininduced stress and not due to selection of a doxorubicin-resistant
cell clone, especially because thermal shock induced an altered
expression of the FBLN-1 molecule without affecting viability of
breast cancer cells. These two different models may yet be reconciled
in light of early results of gene expression analysis in doxorubicinresistant neoplastic cells, indicating increased expression and DNAbinding activity of the Sp1 transcription factor (43). Such a
‘‘doxorubicin-Sp1’’ pathway might explain the observed modulation
of ECM genes after brief drug exposure while providing a mechanism
that stably affects gene expression after long-term drug exposure of
neoplastic cells.
The mechanism by which FBLN-1 exerts chemoresistance in
breast cancer cells remains unclear. Based on the current
knowledge of the biological activities of FBLN-1, the chemoresistance effects might be mediated through integrin adhesion
receptor signaling. FBLN-1 has been shown to suppress the motility
and adhesive-promoting effects of fibronectin (20), which are
mediated by integrin a5h1. In fact, fibronectin has been shown to
deliver survival signals transduced by focal adhesion kinase, leading
to suppression of p53-dependent apoptosis in normal cells (44).
Furthermore, triggering of h1 integrins by ECM interaction
suppresses chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in small-cell lung

cancer cells (8). Moreover, integrin-dependent activation by ECM
components of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway
and cell cycle arrest through p27kip1 up-regulation are important
mechanisms in promoting resistance of neoplastic cells to
chemotherapy (45–47). It is possible that FBLN-1 plays an indirect
role in promoting doxorubicin resistance by facilitating the
interaction of integrins with other ECM components. FBLN-1 may
act as a molecular scaffold assisting in the correct assembly of
complex ECMs, thereby favoring the appropriate spatial orientation
of ECM components needed for efficient engagement and triggering
of integrins. The results described in this study, on FBLN-1 mAb–
mediated inhibition of Matrigel protection against doxorubicininduced apoptosis, are consistent with such model of FBLN-1
function.

In conclusion, our study provides evidence that FBLN-1
promotes chemoresistance in breast cancer cells, adding to the
number of ECM components that provide such prosurvival
function to neoplastic cells. Further studies are needed to
determine the potential usefulness of assessing FBLN-1 expression
in breast tumors as a predictive marker of drug response and as a
therapeutic target to promote drug sensitivity.
