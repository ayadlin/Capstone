ABSTRACT
Background: The value of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel)
in neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer remains uncertain.
Methods: Both electronic databases and proceedings of oncologic meetings
were included in systematic literature search. Pooled rates of pathological complete
response (pCR), odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
using fixed-effect or random-effect model to determine the effect of neoadjuvant nabpaclitaxel.
Results: Twenty-one studies with 2357 patients were included, 3 of which were
randomized clinical trials. The aggregate pCR(ypT0/is ypN0) rate was 32% (95%
CI 25-38%) in unselected breast cancer patients and variated in different subtypes.
Within randomized clinical trials, the probability of achieving pCR was significantly
higher in the nab-paclitaxel group than in the conventional taxanes group (OR =
1.383, 95%CI 1.141-1.676, p = 0.001). For non-hematological toxic effect, any grade
and grade 3-4 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred more frequently with nabpaclitaxel compared to paclitaxel (any grade, OR = 2.090, 95%CI 1.016-4.302, p =
0.045; grade3-4, OR = 3.766, 95%CI 2.324-6.100, p < 0.001). Hypersensitivity was
more common with paclitaxel than nab-paclitaxel at any grade and grade 3-4.
Conclusion: nab-paclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic drug in neoadjuvant treatment
of breast cancer, especially for aggressive tumors in terms of pCR. Exchange of
nab-paclitaxel for conventional taxanes could significantly improve pCR rate with
reasonable toxicities.

INTRODUCTION

most widely used taxanes in breast cancer treatment.
Neoadjuvant paclitaxel significantly increased tumor
response, and improved survival outcome in those
patients who achieved pCR [7-13]. However, paclitaxel
contains a combination of polyethylated castor oil and
ethanol as the solvents to increase drug solubility, which
causes solvent-related toxicities such as hypersensitivity
reactions and prolonged peripheral neuropathy [14, 15].
Clinically, paclitaxel should be administered with steroid
and antihistamine prophylaxis over a prolonged period of
time (3 hours).
Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nabpaclitaxel) is a novel nanometersized particle initially
developed to avoid the toxicities associated with
polyethylated castor oil [16]. It has been hypothesized

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
in women worldwide, and one of the leading causes of
cancer death [1]. In routine clinical practice, neoadjuvant
systemic therapy (NST) has become a widely accepted
choice to treat patients with operable and locally advanced
breast cancer [2]. Patients attained pathologic complete
response (pCR) after NST have significantly improved
long-term survival when compared to those did not [3,4].
Taxanes are essential in the adjuvant treatment of
lymph-node-positive or high-risk, lymph-node-negative
breast cancer [5], and also significantly increased clinical
response and pCR rates for operable breast cancer in
the neoadjuvant setting [6]. Paclitaxel is one of the

that albumin-mediated delivery may result in enhanced
transport of nab-paclitaxel to tumors [17] and improved
tolerability profile of nab-paclitaxel compared with that
of paclitaxel at equimolar doses, with shorter infusion
schedules (30 minutes) and no premedication [16]. In a
pivotal phase III trial of patients with metastatic breast
cancer(MBC), nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 260 mg/m2 has
been shown to achieve higher response rates and longer
time to progression compared to paclitaxel 175 mg/m2
(both given every 3 weeks) [18]. The safety profiles of
nab-paclitaxel were acceptable in most early trials [19-21],
but the data of head-to-head comparison between nabpaclitaxel and paclitaxel is still lacking.
However, in a curative breast cancer setting, no
data is available on whether nab-paclitaxel is equivalent
or even superior to conventional taxanes (paclitaxel,
docetaxel). Several neoadjuvant clinical trials investigated
safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel-based regimens in
operable/locally advanced breast cancer patients. It was
hard to interpret all the information into a clear conclusion
in terms of the value of nab-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant
setting due to: 1) Most of the studies were single-arm,
non-randomized phase II trials with rather small sample
size, 2) disease subtypes varied among studies, 3) variable

study designs regarding to different dose, schedule, drug
combination of nab-paclitaxel, 4) different definitions
of pCR. Therefore, by reviewing all the neoadjuvant
nab-paclitaxel-related studies to date, we performed
this meta-analysis with the aim to 1) assess the efficacy
of nab-paclitaxel in unselected patients as well as in
various intrinsic breast cancer subtypes with specific pCR
definitions, 2) to compare efficacy and toxicity of nabpaclitaxel to conventional taxane regimens in neoadjuvant
breast cancer treatment.

RESULTS
Literature search results
Our literature search yielded 184 relevant records.
Twenty-one studies (11 articles and 10 conference
abstracts), including 2357 patients who had been treated
with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel, met the inclusion criteria
and were eventually selected for meta-analysis (Figure 1).
Eligible trials enrolled patients between 2010 and 2016.

Trial characteristics and treatment details

randomized studies [43, 47, 48] comparing efficacy of
nab-paclitaxel to conventional taxane regimens (paclitaxel
or docetaxel) were included in our meta-analysis. Toxicity
analyses were also performed within randomized
controlled trials [47, 48].

Main characteristics of included trials were listed
in Table 1. Twenty studies reported pCR outcomes with
the definition of ypT0/is ypN0 (absence of residual
invasive cancer within both the breast and lymph nodes,
noninvasive breast residuals allowed), while 6 using ypT0/
is ypN0/+ (absence of invasive breast cancer in the breast
only) and 2 using ypT0 ypN0 (complete eradication of all
invasive and noninvasive cancer), respectively. Subgroup
analysis according to disease subtypes was conducted
in studies whose pCR defined as ypT0/is ypN0. Three

(14%, 95% CI 11-17%) (Figure 3A). The more aggressive
subtypes triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (41%, 95%
CI 38-45%) and HER2+ tumors (54%, 95% CI 43-66%),
had increased frequencies of pCR (Figure 3B, 3C). Within

of epirubicin,5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. In
the control group, taxane regimens were all given at a
standard dose or beyond: in GeparSepto trial, patients were
administrated with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 continuous weekly
for 12 weeks followed by EC; 4 cycles of paclitaxel 90mg/
m2 every 3 out of 4 weeks followed by EC were given in
ETNA trial; 4 cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m2, every 3-week
were given in Kuwayama study. When compared to
conventional taxane regimens, patients with neoadjuvant
nab-paclitaxel achieved significantly more frequent pCR
(OR = 1.383, 95%CI 1.141-1.676, p = 0.001) (Figure 4A).
A funnel plot of the effect size for each randomized trial
against the precision showed no asymmetry (Figure 4B),
which indicating no potential publication bias.

Efficacy comparison in randomized trials
Three randomized trials, including 2,053 breast
cancer patients, compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel
versus conventional taxane (paclitaxel/docetaxel).
Patients with HER2+ disease in GeparSepto trial were
also treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, while the
other two trials both included only HER2- patients. The
schedules and dosages of nab-paclitaxel in each study
were as below: in GeparSepto trial, patients received
nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 continuous weekly for 12
weeks (reduced from the initial dose of 150 mg/m2 after
a protocol amendment due to high frequency of grade 3-4
peripheral sensory neuropathy) followed by epirubicin/
cyclophosphamide(EC); in ETNA trial, a lower dose
of nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m²in 3 out of 4 weeks for 4
cycles followed by EC; and 4 cycles of nab-paclitaxel

DISCUSSION

extracted to compare the toxicity profiles of nab-paclitaxel
to paclitaxel in the preoperative setting. One thousand
eight hundreds and seventy eight patients were eventually
included into safety analysis, the numbers of all adverse
events and those worse than grade 3 were listed in Table 2.
The hematological toxic effects, neutropenia,
leucopenia, increase of alanine aminotransferase, increase
of aspartate aminotransferase were generally equivalent
but numerically higher in nab-paclitaxel group than
paclitaxel group. For non-hematological toxic effect,
all grades of peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred
more frequently in nab-paclitaxel group as compared to
paclitaxel group(OR = 2.090, 95%CI 1.016-4.302, p =
0.045). Patients received nab-paclitaxel were 3 times more
likely to have severer than grade 3 peripheral sensory
neuropathy events (OR = 3.766, 95%CI 2.324-6.100,
p < 0.001). Hypersensitivity was more common with
paclitaxel than nab-paclitaxel at any grade and at grades
3-4, even though that patients in the paclitaxel group
already received premedication. Other non-hematological
toxic effects, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue and
diarrhea at any grade were identical in two groups.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
demonstrate that nab-paclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic
drug as in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast
cancer patients, especially in aggressive subtypes.
Moreover, this is the first meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials in breast cancer, indicating neoadjuvant nabpaclitaxel significantly improved pCR rate compared to
conventional taxanes with generally reasonable toxicity
profiles.
In our study, nab-paclitaxel among unselected
primary breast cancer patients showed a wide range of
pCR rates from 4% to 53%, with a fairly high overall
rate of 32%. It is higher than the pCR rate (ypT0/is N0,
19.8%), reported in the German Breast Group (GBG)
pooled analysis including seven prospective clinical trials
using neoadjuvant anthracycline plus conventional taxane
chemotherapy [43]. Additionally, nab-paclitaxel has
shown promising early response in neoadjuvant setting.
The latest results of ETNA trial showed a clinical overall
response rate of 69.4% after first 4 cycles of single-agent
neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel, even though the improved

pCR rate with nab-paclitaxel did not reach statistical
significance [39]. In WSG-ADAPT TN trial, significant
tumor necrosis in 3-week re-biopsy was detected in 24%
of the patients after first cycle of nab-paclitaxel, which
could contribute to the prediction of pCR rate [33].
Furthermore, patients with more aggressive tumors
seemed to benefit from the exchange of nab-paclitaxel.
pCR rates in HR-/HER2+ group (61%, 95% CI 47-74%)
and TNBC group (41%, 95% CI 38-45%) were much
higher than those observed in other breast cancer subtypes.
Patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer had the lowest
incidence of pCR (14%, 95% CI 11-17). Pooled-analysis
indicated that pCR was significantly more common in
patients treated with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel when
compared to conventional, standard dose or beyond
taxanes (OR = 1.383, 95%CI 1.141-1.676, p = 0.001). Of
note, in the GeparSepto trial, pCR rate almost doubled in
the TNBC cohort treated with nab-paclitaxel compared
to paclitaxel [38]. Similarly, TNBC patients treated with
first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic setting also achieved
excellent tumor response [44, 45]. Therefore, nabpaclitaxel might be a reasonable taxane-based regimen
for curable TNBC patients due to lack of promising
ways to further improve the outcomes, but future study
is warranted.
In order to improve the benefit of systemic
treatment, predictive biomarkers are important in
tailoring individualized anti-cancer therapy. But so
far we have failed to identify any subset most likely to
benefit from neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel. Secreted protein
acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is an albumin and
calcium binding glycoprotein, one of its main function
is to facilitate tissue remodeling [46]. Hypothetically, an
accumulation of SPARC in breast cancer cells and stroma
could increase its ability to bind albumin, therefore might
serve as a predictive marker for nab-paclitaxel. In the
GeparTrio trial, investigators found that high expression
of SPARC in tumor cells was significantly correlated
with increased pCR rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
[47]. However, in the GeparSepto trial, the benefit
difference from neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel in the SPARCoverexpressing group was not remarkable compared to the
SPARC-negative cohort [38]. Data in metastatic setting
also failed to prove association between efficacy of nabpaclitaxel and SPARC expression [48]. More evidences
from large prospective trials are warranted to find
predictive markers for nab-paclitaxel treatment.
In this meta-analysis, nab-paclitaxel has almost
identical toxicities as conventional taxanes except
peripheral sensory neuropathy. Both any grade and grade
3-4 peripheral sensory neuropathy were significantly
more frequent in nab-paclitaxel group compared to the
conventional taxane group. In GeparSepto trial, after
dose amendment of nab-paclitaxel from 150 to 125 mg/
m2 continuous weekly for 12 weeks, the frequency of
grade 3-4 peripheral sensory neuropathy in nab-paclitaxel
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

group decreased from 15% to 8% [38]; in ETNA trial,
when nab-paclitaxel was given 125 mg/m2 every 3 out
of 4 weeks for 4 cycles, the frequency of grade 3-4
peripheral sensory neuropathy was 4.5%, which might
be one of the explanations that the primary endpoint of
this trial, improved pCR after nab-paclitaxel, did not meet
statistical significance [39]. Long-term follow-up would
be necessary to identify symptom relief patterns and its
impact on quality of life.
Notably, in our analysis, patients had less
hypersensitivity events in nab-paclitaxel group
even though premedication was already given in the
conventional group. A few clinical-economic studies
supported the cost-effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel in MBC
when compared to conventional taxanes since it lowered
the incidence of severe adverse events and expenses of
managing the critical clinical situations [49, 50].
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that nabpaclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic drug in neoadjuvant
treatment of breast cancer, especially in patients with
aggressive tumors like TNBC and HER2+ diseases.
Exchange of neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel for conventional
taxanes could significantly improve the probability of pCR
with generally reasonable toxicities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study selection
According to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guideline [51], a systematic search of Pubmed was
performed using the medical subject heading (MeSH)
terms ‘‘breast neoplasms’’, as well as the following
keywords: (1) breast cancer; AND (2) nab-paclitaxel
OR nanoparticle paclitaxel; AND (3) neoadjuvant OR
preoperative OR primary systemic. The “related articles”
function was used to broaden the search. All abstracts,
studies and citations were checked for additional material
when appropriate. In addition, abstracts from annual
meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology
Conference (ESMO) and San Antonio Breast Cancer
Symposium (SABCS) were retrieved for relevant abstracts
using similar search terms. No language restrictions were
made but all available comparative studies were in English
language.

Data extraction
Two investigators (Y Zong, JY Wu) independently
performed the search, reviewed and extracted the
following data from each study according to a prespecified protocol: first author, year of publication, study

demographics, study design, number of subjects, treatment
regimen, and end-point data (pCR). Where discrepancies
arose, papers were re-examined and consensus was
reached by discussion.

The primary endpoint of interest in our study was
the total number of patients who achieved pCR, the
definition of which varied significantly among the studies
included. We conducted our analysis according to each
definition of pCR, including ypT0/is ypN0, ypT0 ypN0
and ypT0/is ypN0/+, in order to obtain more detailed and
precise results. Besides, comparison of the toxicity profiles
of nab-paclitaxel and paclitaxel in randomized trials was
also performed.

Aggregate pCR rates were calculated in the nabpaclitaxel-containing arm and the no-nab-paclitaxel arm.
Dichotomous data for each trial were expressed as an odds
ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An OR of
>1 favors the nab-paclitaxel group, and the point estimate
of the OR was considered statistically significant at the P
< 0.05 level if the 95% CI did not include the value of one.
Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using Cochrane’s
Q statistic and quantified using the I2 statistic. Pooled
estimates of outcomes were calculated using a fixed-effect
model (Mantel-Haenszel test) but a random-effect model
(DerSimonian-Laird test) was used when heterogeneity
was present. The software package STATA (version 14.0,
