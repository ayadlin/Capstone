ABSTRACT
We propose CHI3L1 as a prognostic biomarker for patients with epithelial ovarian
carcinoma (EOC) and also suggest possible biological functions of CHI3L1. We measured
CHI3L1 expression with quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
in 180 women with EOC and evaluated correlations between CHI3L1 expression,
clinicopathological characteristics, and the outcomes of the patients. The expression
of CHI3L1 was higher in cancerous tissues than in normal tissues. The expression of
CHI3L1 was also higher in patients with a serous histological type, advanced stage,
and chemoresistance. Patients with high CHI3L1 expression had a shorter progressionfree survival (p < 0.001)and overall survival (p < 0.001). Patients with high CHI3L1
expression also had a high risk of recurrence (p < 0.001)and death (p < 0.001). In vitro
studies showed that CHI3L1 up-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein
and hampered paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest
that CHI3L1 shows potential as a prognostic biomarker for EOC. CHI3L1 may promote
chemoresistance via inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis by up-regulating Mcl-1.

chemoresistance may be helpful in the development of
new therapeutic strategies.
Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is located on chromosome
1q32.1, and the product, YKL-40, a 40-kDa glycoprotein,
is secreted by numerous human cells such as cartilage,
synovium, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and cancer
cells. It plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation and extracellular
tissue remodeling [8]. Elevated levels of serum YKL-40
are reported to be associated with several types of cancer,
including ovary, breast, brain and lung cancer [9–18],
and several medical and inflammatory diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and coronary
artery disease [19–21]. These medical, inflammatory, and
malignant diseases all possibly contribute to the levels of
serum YKL-40. In our study, we used real-time quantitative
PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the quantitative expression of
CHI3L1 in ovarian cancer tissues without the influence of
other malignancies or medical diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) has received
increasing attention in recent years because it is associated
with the highest mortality rate among gynecologic
malignancies [1, 2]. The majority of patients are
diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis
[3]. Current management strategies include debulking
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen of
platinum and paclitaxel, which has a response rate of
80% for all patients and 40–60% for advanced-stage
patients [4]. However, patients, especially those with an
advanced stage, usually relapse after an initial response
and ultimately die of recurrence [3]. Chemoresistance
is an obstacle in the management of ovarian cancer. To
overcome this problem several mechanisms have been
proposed including suppression of apoptotic pathways,
increased DNA repair and over-expression of multidrugresistance genes [5–7]. Elucidating the mechanisms of

CHI3L1 has been reported to play roles in the
carcinogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of
glioma and prostate cancer [22–24]. The role of CHI3L1 in
tumor angiogenesis has also been noted [25–27]. However,
the role of CHI3L1 in ovarian cancer and chemoresistance
is currently unknown. We initially investigated the
correlation of clinical outcomes of patients and CHI3L1
expression to evaluate the feasibility of using CHI3L1 as
a prognostic biomarker for patients with EOC. We used in
vitro studies to elucidate the possible mechanism of CHI3L1
in chemoresistance. The results of this study may clarify
the role of CHI3L1 in ovarian cancer and elucidate whether
CHI3L1 is a potential biomarker of chemoresponse and a
potential target for the treatment of patients with EOC.

higher in those with a serous histologic type (0.192 vs. 0.031,
p = 0.002), chemoresistance (0.205 vs. 0.082, p = 0.011),
recurrence (0.186 vs. 0.051, p = 0.011), and death (0.224 vs.
0.110, p = 0.030) than in those with a non-serous histologic
type, chemosensitivity, non reoccurring, and in those who
were still alive (all by the Student’s t-test). The patients with
a high grade or advanced stage did not have higher CHI3L1
levels than those with a low grade or early stage.

CHI3L1 is a poor prognostic factor for EOC
We further evaluated whether CHI3L1 could be
a prognostic factor for the 180 patients with EOC. The
patients with high CHI3L1 expression (≥ 0.1) had a
shorter progression free survival (PFS) (log-rank test, p
< 0.001, Figure 2A) and overall survival (OS) (log-rank
test, p < 0.001, Figure 2B) than those with a low CHI3L1
expression (< 0.1) in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
We further analyzed the 96 patients whose tumor
size was ≤ 1 cm after debulking surgery. Those with high
CHI3L1 expression also had a shorter PFS (log-rank test,
p = 0.039, Figure 2C) and OS (log-rank test, p = 0.024,
Figure 2D) compared with those with low CHI3L1
expression. In addition, of the 153 patients who received
paclitaxel-platinum chemotherapy, those with high
CHI3L1 expression had a shorter PFS (log-rank test, p <
0.001, Figure 2E) and OS (log-rank test, p < 0.001, Figure
2F) compared with those with low CHI3L1 expression.
The hazard ratios (HR) of various risk factors by Cox
regression analysis for the total 180 women with EOC are
shown in Table 3. Using univariate analysis, high CHI3L1
expression (HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58–
3.41, p < 0.001), advanced stage (HR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.40
− 4.31, p = 0.002), high-grade (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.10
− 3.20, p = 0.019) and residual tumor size > 1 cm after
debulking surgery (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.34 − 2.72, p <
0.001) were risk factors for recurrence. Using multivariate
analysis, high CHI3L1 expression (HR: 2.91, 95% CI:
1.89 − 4.48, p < 0.001), advanced stage (HR: 2.47, 95%
CI: 1.24 − 4.90, p = 0.009), high-grade (HR: 1.73, 95%
CI: 1.01 − 2.97, p = 0.044) and residual tumor size > 1 cm
after debulking surgery (HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.18 − 2.57, p =
0.005) were independent risk factors for recurrence.
Using univariate analysis, high CHI3L1 expression
(HR 3.03, 95% CI: 1.84 − 5.00, p < 0.001), advanced
stage (HR: 5.20, 95% CI: 1.63 − 16.59, p = 0.005) and
residual tumor size > 1 cm after debulking surgery (HR:
3.09, 95% CI: 1.81 − 5.26, p < 0.001) were risk factors for
death.. However, multivariate analysis showed that high
CHI3L1 expression (HR: 4.03, 95% CI: 2.37 − 6.87, p <
0.001), advanced stage (HR: 4.65, 95% CI: 1.41 − 15.31,
p = 0.011) and residual tumor size > 1 cm after debulking
surgery (HR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.70 − 5.10, p < 0.001) were
independent risk factors for death.
These results suggest that CHI3L1 expression is a
poor prognostic factor for patients with EOC.

RESULTS
The expression of CHI3L1 is higher in EOCs
than in the normal ovarian tissues
A total of 180 patients with EOC were enrolled
and 40 normal ovarian tissues were used as a reference.
The representative figures of the qRT-PCR for CHI3L1
and G6PDH are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. The mean
expression of CHI3L1 in the EOCs was much higher than
that in the normal ovarian tissue (0.177 vs. 0.001, p < 0.001,
Student’s t-test, Figure 1C and 1D).

The expression of CHI3L1 is higher in patients
with EOC that also present with a serous
histologic type, advanced stage, chemoresistance,
and poor outcome
The basic characteristics of the 180 patients are shown
in Table 1. There were 129 (71.7%) serous carcinomas,
13 (7.2%) endometrioid carcinomas, 14 (7.8%) clear cell
carcinomas, 8 (4.4%) carcinosarcomas, 3 (1.7%) transitional
cell carcinomas and 13 (7.2%) carcinomas of mixed type. The
expression of CHI3L1 was higher in the patients with a serous
histologic type (0.174 vs. 0.029, p = 0.002), advanced stage
(stages III/IV) (0.153 vs. 0.047, p = 0.046), chemoresistance
(0.195 vs. 0.076, p = 0.004), recurrence (0.169 vs. 0.049,
p = 0.008), and death (0.200 vs. 0.104, p = 0.036) than in
those with a non-serous histologic type, early stage (stages
I/II), chemosensitive, non recurring, and in those who were
still alive (all by the Student’s t-test) (Table 2). There was no
difference in the expression of CHI3L1 between tumors with
a high (III) or low (I + II) histological grade.
Of the 96 women whose residual tumor size was
≤ 1 cm after debulking surgery (Table 2), those with
a serous histologic type (0.165 vs. 0.022, p = 0.008) or
chemoresistance (0.206 vs. 0.071, p = 0.019) had higher
levels of CHI3L1 than those with a non-serous histologic
type or chemosensitivity (both by the Student’s t-test).
Of the 153 patients who received platinum with
paclitaxel chemotherapy, the levels of CHI3L1 were also

To investigate the possible biological effects of
CHI3L1 on ovarian cancer cells, CHI3L1-transfected

have not been promising [14, 35, 36]. Therefore, we used
qRT-PCR in this study to quantitatively measure CHI3L1
expression in ovarian cancer tissues without the influence of
other malignancies or medical diseases.
In this study, we found that CHI3L1 expression in
cancerous tissues is a prognostic biomarker for patients
with EOC. CHI3L1 expression was higher in patients with
a serous histological type, advanced stage, chemoresistance
and poor prognosis. Previous studies of ovarian cancer
tissue also showed that YKL-40 was related to histology,
stage and shorter survival by immunohistochemistry [14,
35, 36]. A high CHI3L1 expression was associated with
recurrence and death in our study. The correlation of poor
outcome and high CHI3L1 expression was also observed
in patients whose residual tumor size was ≤ 1 cm after
debulking surgery or chemotherapy with paclitaxel. In
multivariate Cox regression analysis, we found that high
CHI3L1 expression, advanced stage, and residual tumor
size > 1 cm after debulking surgery were independent
risk factors for recurrence and death. Therefore, we

DISCUSSION
Several studies have been published on the ability of
serum or plasma YKL-40 to detect and assess therapeutic
responses or as a prognostic predictor of ovarian cancer
[9–15], although other studies have not supported this role
[28, 29]. Elevated levels of serum YKL-40 have been reported
in several other types of cancer, including breast [16],
gastrointestinal tract [30], prostate [31], brain [17], and lung
[18] cancer. In addition, several medical and inflammatory
diseases have been associated with elevated serum levels
of YKL-40, including polycystic ovarian syndrome [32],
rheumatoid arthritis [19], diabetes mellitus [20], stroke [33],
coronary artery disease [21] and asthma [34]. Only a few
studies have investigated YKL-40 expression in ovarian
cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry, and the results

further investigated whether CHI3L1 plays a role in the
chemoresistance of ovarian carcinoma.
Studies have found possible biological functions
and mechanisms for CHI3L1 in cancer cells [22, 37]. For
example, CHI3L1 regulates the proliferation of glioma cells
through MAPK and AKT pathways [37], and it also plays
roles in tumorigenesis and local invasion through matrix
metalloproteinase-2 [22]. Nuclear factor I-X3 and STAT3 has
also been identified in controlling the migration and invasion
of glioma cells via the regulation of CHI3L1 [24]. CHI3L1 has
also been found to promote tumor angiogenesis by inducing
the coordination of membrane-bound receptor syndecan-1 and
integrin alpha(v)beta(3), and by activating MAPK kinase1/2
in endothelial cells [25, 26]. However, the biological function
of CHI3L1 in ovarian cancer had not been explored.
We found that CHI3L1 interfered with the
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of human ovarian cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells by up-regulating the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 molecule.
The cell toxicity of paclitaxel acts through the stabilization
of microtubules, cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M-phase
and the activation of apoptotic pathways [38]. Several
mechanisms of drug resistance have been proposed,
including suppression of apoptotic pathways [5], increased
DNA repair [6] and over-expression of multidrugresistance genes [7]. Our results indicate that CHI3L1
could up-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 in favor of antiapoptotic pathways to hamper the apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian cancer cells. However,
we did not find an anti-apoptotic effect of CHI3L1 in the
ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin. OVCAR3 and
CA5171 cells are resistant to cisplatin [39, 40], and this
may have a determinative effect on evaluating the role of
CHI3L1 in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We also confirmed
these findings in endometrial cancer cell models. Further
39748

studies are needed to uncover the complex mechanism
of cisplatin- or paclitaxel-induced apoptosis involving
CHI3L1 and apoptosis-regulatory molecules.
The primary treatments for epithelial ovarian
carcinoma include cytoreduction surgery and adjuvant
chemotherapy, however survival is affected by
disease recurrence and chemoresistance [41]. The
goal of primary cytoreduction surgery is to remove
as much tumor mass as possible to prevent residual
disease, however it has been reported that maximal
cytoreduction has only been achieved in 20–90% of
patients, depending on the experience of the surgeon
[42]. Chemoresistance is another problem in the
management of ovarian cancer, for which several novel
agents are now under investigation [3, 41, 43]. Although
recurrent disease is generally incurable, management
with surgery, combination of salvage chemotherapy,
and targeted therapy might improve progression-free
survival [41]. Advances in the molecular biology
of ovarian cancer can promote the development of
targeted therapy to provide personalized medicine.
Our study indicated that a high CHI3L1 expression

was an independent prognostic factor for EOC, even
in the patients whose residual tumor size < 1cm after
debulking surgery or who receiving paclitaxel-platinum
chemotherapy. Our in vitro experiments also show that
CHI3L1 can promote ovarian cancer cell resistance to
paclitaxel by up-regulating Mcl-1. These findings may
be incorporated into trials of new agents to treat EOC.
Based on the CHI3L1 expression in ovarian cancer
tissue, appropriate candidates can be selected to receive
combinations of paclitaxel-platinum chemotherapy and
other novel anti-apoptotic agents, especially Mcl-1.
A combination of anti- CHI3L1 neutralizing antibody
and irradiation can synergistically inhibit tumor
vascularization and progression in xenografted brain
tumor models [44, 45]. Also, resveratrol was found to
repress the expression of CHI3L1 in glioma cells in in
vitro experiments [46]. Currently, no cancer therapeutic
agent related to CHI3L1 or YKL 40 has been reported.
Our current study may provide preliminary findings for
developing specific therapies [47]. Further clinical trials
are needed to prove the utility of CHI3L1 in managing
patients with ovarian cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[48]. The patients received regular follow-up every 3
months after the primary treatment. Abnormal results of
imaging studies (including computerized tomography
or magnetic resonance imaging), elevated CA125 (more
than 2 times the upper normal limit) of two consecutive
tests in 2-week intervals, or biopsy-proven disease were
defined as recurrence. Patients with disease progression
or recurrence 6 months or less after completing adjuvant
chemotherapy were defined as being chemoresistant,
while those without recurrence or recurrence more
than 6 months after completing adjuvant chemotherapy
were defined as chemosensitive. Progression-free
survival was calculated as the period from the date
of completing chemotherapy to the date of confirmed
recurrence, disease progression, or last follow-up.
Overall survival was calculated as the period from
surgery to the date of death associated with disease
or the date of last follow-up. Pre-existing clinical
data including age, menopausal status, clinical stage,
treatment history, surgical findings during debulking,
recurrence status, and survival were collected from
medical records stored in a centralized database.

Patients and specimens
The study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the hospital. Patients
with EOC who received staging or debulking surgery
and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy were
enrolled, and informed consent was obtained before
collecting samples. Cancerous tissue specimens
were collected during surgery, immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C until the
experiments. Normal ovarian tissues were collected
from women with benign gynecologic lesions who
underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and were
also immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at −70°C until the experiments. The maximal residual
tumor size after surgery was recorded and was divided
as two groups- ≤ 1 cm and > 1 cm. Histological grading
was based on the International Union against Cancer
criteria, and staging was based on the criteria of the
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

primer ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG and antisense
promer TGCTGTA GCCAAATTCGTTG were used for
30 cycles. The PCR products were then analyzed in 1%
agarose gel with EtBr staining in TBE solution.

Total RNA of the tissue specimens was isolated
with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The samples were subsequently passed over a Qiagen
RNeasy column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for removal of
small fragments that affect RT reaction and hybridization
quality. After RNA recovery, cDNA was synthesized by a
chimeric oligonucleotide with an oligo-dT and a T7 RNA
polymerase promoter at a concentration of 100 pmol/μL.

Transfection of CHI3L1 in OVCAR3 cells
The OVCAR3 cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The
transcription status of CHI3L1 in OVCAR3 cells was
checked by RT-PCR as described above. The plasmid
PLKO_AS3w.puro was purchased from the National
RNAi Core Facility (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). To
generate PLKO_AS3w CHI3L1.puro, CHI3L1 was first
amplified by PCR using OVCAR3 cell cDNA as the
template with sense primer (NheI) Hu-CHI3L1_S_NheI
GGCTAGCACCATGGGTGTGAAGGCGTCTCAAAC
and anti-sense primer (PstI) Hu-CHI3L1_AS_
PstI TAACTGCAGCTCAGCCTGGGACTCAGCA. The
amplified product was then cloned into the NheI/PstI sites
of PLKO_AS3w.puro. The transfection was followed the
protocol on the website http://rnai.genmed.sinica.edu.tw/
webContent/web/protocols. OVCAR3 cells transfected
with PLKO_AS3w.puro (mock) were used as the control.
The CHI3L1 expression was assayed by RT-PCR and
Western blot. The stable clones of various OVCAR3
transfectants were used in the following experiments.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(QRT-PCR)
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a RevertAid
first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). QRT-PCR was performed using a
LightCycler Real-Time detection system (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). The relative abundance of mRNA
level was calculated by using the comparative method with
G6PDH as the internal control. Detection of CHI3L1 was
performed using the primer Hs00609691_m1 (TaqMan®
Assays, Life Technologies Corporation) with 50 cycles of 10
seconds at 95°C, 10 seconds at 60°C, and 10 seconds at 72°C.
Detection of G6PDH was performed using the LightCycler
h-G6PDH housekeeping gene set (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN) with 50 cycles of 10 seconds at 95°C, 15
seconds at 55°C, and 15 seconds at 72°C.
The comparative 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate
the expression of the target gene as described previously
[49]. Generation of quantitative data was based on the
number of cycles needed for amplification-generated
fluorescence to reach a specific threshold of detection
(the Ct value). For the relative quantification of gene
expression on the basis of adding fixed amounts of RNAstarting material to the reactions, the Ct values obtained
for each real-time PCR were first transformed using the
term E−Ct, where E is reaction efficiency, divided by the
corresponding value obtained for the same gene in the
reference sample (normal ovarian tissues). The following
equation was used to calculate the expression level of
CHI3L1 in each sample: Relative expression level of
CHI3L1 = 2−ΔΔCt, ΔCt = Ct target (CHI3L1) − Ct housekeeping (G6PDH),
ΔΔCt = ΔCt sample (ovarian cancer tissue) −ΔCt calibrator (normal ovarian tissue).

Knock-down of CHI3L1 in CA5171 cells
To eliminate endogenous CHI3L1 expression in
CA5171 cells [40], an in-vitro knock-down experiment
by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting to CHI3L1
were performed. shRNA for CHI3L1 was purchased
from National RNAi Core Facility. CHI3L1 shRNA
constructed lentivirus were collected from 293T cells
transfected with shRNA vector, Δ8.91and pMD.G. All
plasmids were re-suspended in Opti-MEM® medium and
transfected by using Lipofectamine2000 reagent according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate CHI3L1knockdown CA5171 cells (CA5171-shCHI3L1), CA5171
cell were seeded in 6-cm dishes and infected with CHI3L1
shRNA lentivirus containing 10 μg/ml polybrene for 48
hours. For selecting of stable clones, puromycin were added
to the culture medium for further 48-hour incubation. The
CHI3L1 expression was assayed by RT-PCR and Western
blot. The stable clones of various CA5171 transfectants
were used in the following experiments.

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
RNA was first reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, San Diego, CA). To generate
CHI3L1, sense primer TGTGAAGGCGTCTCAAACAG
and anti-sense primer AATTCGGCCTTCATTTCCTT
were used for 30 cycles. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the housekeeping
gene to compare with CHI3L1. To generate GAPDH, sense

CHI3L1 expression was assayed by RT-PCR and Western
blot. The stable clones of various HEC1b transfectants
were used in the following experiments.

Immunoblotting assays of the various OVCAR3,
CA5171, HEC1b and HEC151 transfectants were
performed. Briefly, the cells were first lysed in the
immunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the protein
extracts were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce, Rockford, IL). Fifty μg of each cell lysate was
then resolved by SDS/PAGE (12% gel), transferred onto
a PVDF/nylon membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA), and probed with Abs specific to α-tubulin, YKL,
Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bak and Bax (Upstate Biotechnology,
Lake Placid, NY). The membrane was then probed with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (Upstate
Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The specific bands
were visualized by an ECL® Western blotting system
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Protein levels
were measured by densitometric analysis and normalized
to the levels of α-tubulin (control) by ImageQuant 5.0
software (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The
expression level of each protein was presented as the fold
change in comparison with the density of α-tubulin, and
the expression levels in the original OVCAR3, CA5171,
HEC1b and HEC151 cells were used as the reference.

Knock-down of CHI3L1 in HEC151 cells
To eliminate endogenous CHI3L1 expression
in HEC151 cells, an in-vitro knock-down experiment
by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting to CHI3L1
were performed. shRNA for CHI3L1 was purchased
from National RNAi Core Facility. CHI3L1 shRNA
constructed lentivirus were collected from 293T cells
transfected with shRNA vector, Δ8.91and pMD.G. All
plasmids were re-suspended in Opti-MEM® medium
and transfected by using Lipofectamine2000 reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate
CHI3L1-knockdown HEC151 cells (HEC151-shCHI3L1),
HEC151 cell were seeded in 6-cm dishes and infected
with CHI3L1 shRNA lentivirus containing 10 μg/ml
polybrene for 48 hours. For selecting of stable clones,
puromycin were added to the culture medium for further
48-hour incubation. The CHI3L1 expression was assayed
by RT-PCR and Western blot. The stable clones of
various HEC151 transfectants were used in the following
experiments.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons
between unpaired groups were made using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Student’s t-test for
continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables. Levels of CHI3L1 of more than 0.1 were defined
as a high CHI3L1 expression, and those less than 0.1 were
defined as a low CHI3L1 expression. Survival curves
were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
differences in survival curves were calculated using the
log rank test. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate
the prognostic factors for recurrence and death. All data
were expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three different
experiments. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

Apoptotic assays of the ovarian cancer cells
Apoptotic assays of the various OVCAR3, CA5171,
HEC1b and HEC151 transfectants treated with respective
cytotoxic agent were performed by detecting 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and annexin V in these cells.
Briefly, the cells were treated with 2.5 nM of paclitaxel or
12.5 μM of cisplatin for 48 hours. Paclitaxel and cisplatin
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). The preparation and dosage of these
drugs were according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and previous studies [50, 51]. Cells treated with PBS were
used as the negative control. The cells were then incubated
with 7-AAD and FITC-conjugated annexin V (BD
Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), respectively, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, and were then analyzed
by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Bioscience, Franklin
Lakes, NJ).
