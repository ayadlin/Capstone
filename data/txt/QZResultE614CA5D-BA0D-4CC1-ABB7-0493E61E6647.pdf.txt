Abstract
Inflammation has increasingly been recognized as a critical component influencing tumor growth. Recent
reports have revealed conflicting evidence for the role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in modulating tumorigenesis.
In our study, we implicate TLR3 in mediating immune surveillance with increased growth of implanted transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) tumors in TLR3−/− compared with TLR3+/+ mice. Activation of TLR3 by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) leads to induction of multiple inflammatory
pathways, including NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors. We explored the potential of TLR3 stimulation in prostate cancer immunotherapy and showed that treatment with
polyI:C can strongly suppress both s.c. implanted TRAMP tumors in syngenic mice as well as orthotopic prostate cancers in TRAMP C57Bl6 × FvB F1 Tg+/− transgenic mice. Treated tumors remained well differentiated to
moderately differentiated with increased infiltration of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells compared
with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma observed in untreated tumors. Like TLR3−/− mice, IFN-α receptor 1
(IFNAR1)−/− mice exhibited reduced tumor surveillance and impaired tumor suppression following polyI:C
treatment. We observed that type I IFN–dependent induction of cytokines was responsible for NK activation,
with depletion of NK cells leading to increased tumor growth as well as expansion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T
regulatory lymphocytes. Our study therefore delineates the importance of IFNAR-dependent functions in
TLR3-mediated tumor suppression and supports the use of TLR3 agonists for prostate cancer immune-based
therapies. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2595–603. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In advanced prostate cancer, the failure of hormone therapy or chemotherapy to provide durable responses has forced
investigations into other modalities such as tumor immunotherapy. Although the mechanisms of tumor surveillance
remain unclear, innate immune recognition of tumors and
subsequent activation of adaptive immunity within the microenvironment may modulate tumor growth. Areas of malignant glands in prostate cancer are frequently juxtaposed to
inflamed areas of prostate tissue, implying that either inflammation propagates the cancer or is responding to it (1). Potential candidate receptors in regulating these inflammatory
processes include the family of Toll-like receptors (TLR). The
TLR family of pattern recognition receptors consists of 13

mammalian receptors that recognize conserved microbial
motifs, or pathogen-associated molecular patterns specific
for microbial components (2). Predominantly expressed in innate immune cells, TLRs recognize these motifs and trigger
innate immune activation with a subsequent direction of
adaptive immunity. Several endogenous ligands such as
heat-shock proteins, the chromatin component HMGB1,
and other components of injured cells collectively termed
danger-associated molecular patterns have also been characterized, suggesting a role for this receptor family in inflammatory responses resulting from tissue damage even in the
absence of infection, such as the transformed cell (3).
Most TLRs interact with and recruit the adaptor proteins
myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)
and then serine kinase interleukin (IL)-1 receptor–associated
kinase (IRAK), leading to the activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK), NF-κB, and expression of inflammatory genes (2). Negative regulatory mechanisms exist to balance the robust immune activation to prevent tissue damage
and autoimmunity. This includes negative regulation of intracellular signaling pathways at the level of IRAK by IRAK-M or
through the activation of T regulatory (Treg) cells (4–6). TLR3
is unique in that it signals exclusively through MyD88independent pathways and activates IRF-3, thereby inducing
type I interferons (IFN) and IFN-inducible genes. This occurs

through the adaptor protein TIR domain–containing adapterinducing IFN-β (TRIF), also known as TLR adaptor molecule
1. Best known for the regulation of type I IFNs in antiviral responses, TLR3 has also been implicated in natural killer (NK)
cell activation and dendritic cell maturation (7–9). Whereas
MyD88-dependent pathways largely regulate CTL induction,
NK activation relies on TRIF-dependent pathways (8).
The role of TLRs in mediating immune surveillance is
conflicting, as prior reports have suggested tumor-promoting
as well as tumor-suppressing effects. Deficiency in MyD88
confers decreased development of tumors in a mouse model
of spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis and diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular tumors, whereas deficiency in
IRAK-M also impairs growth of implanted tumor cells, although these adaptor molecules have opposing effects on
TLR signaling (10–12). Nonetheless, TLR agonists have been
used as adjuvants to enhance host immunity, with the TLR7
agonist imiquimod approved for use in treatment of basal
cell cancer and TLR9 agonists in phase I to III trials against
multiple malignancies, including breast, melanoma, and lymphomas (13). Although growth of tumors in the absence of
TLR3 has not been studied, the absence of type I IFNs in
IFN-α receptor 1 (IFNAR1)−/− mice resulted in increased melanomas in a syngenic mouse model (14).
In this study, we examined the role of MyD88-independent
pathways in tumor surveillance and showed increased
growth of tumors in the absence of TLR3. Exploring the ability of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) to suppress
prostate cancer growth, we showed growth retardation of autochthonous TRAMP tumors through both IFN-dependent
and IFN-independent pathways. The TLR3-dependent activation of NK cells may in part mediate this effect, whereas the
depletion of NK cells resulted in an induction of Treg lymphocytes. This work further implicates and highlights TLR3
as a mediator of tumor immune surveillance and provides
mechanistic insight in the balance between inflammation
and immune tolerance.

Materials and Methods
Mice. TRAMP Tg+/− mice on a C57Bl6 background ( Jackson
Laboratories) were generated and genotyped as previously described (15). For the assessment of autochthonous TRAMP
tumors by polyI:C, 10-wk-old TRAMP C57Bl6 × FvB F1 Tg+/−
males were given i.p. saline or 250 μg of polyI:C (Sigma) reconstituted in 100 μL sterile normal saline weekly for 6 consecutive
weeks. TLR3−/− mice backcrossed to a C57Bl6 background over
10 generations and IFNAR1−/− mice backcrossed to a C57Bl6
background for six generations were generated and genotyped
as previously described (gift from Shizuo Akira, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; ref. 16). Six- to 8-wk-old male mice were used
for the experiments. Age-matched IFNAR1+/+ male littermates
and C57Bl6 wild-type males for TLR3−/− mice were used as controls. All mice were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions
in the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)–Division
of Laboratory Animal Medicine facilities according to Animal
Research Committee protocols.

Cell culture. TRAMP C2 cell lines (American Type Culture
Collection) were grown in DMEM supplemented with
0.005 mg/mL bovine insulin, 10 mmol/L DHEA, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% NuSerum IV (Life Technologies Bethesda
Research Laboratories). For cell viability determination,
4,000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate overnight and treated with incremental concentrations of polyI:
C for 48 h. Incorporation of MTT (Sigma) was assessed by
spectroscopy at 600 λ and compared to a standard curve.
Subcutaneous tumor implantation model. TRAMP C2
cells grown to log phase were harvested with trypsinized media and washed in DMEM twice. Following s.c. implantation
of 5 × 106 cells in 100 μL normal saline in the shaved flank of
male mice, tumor size was determined by measuring the
length, width, and depth of tumor and multiplying the product by π/6 to estimate tumor volume in an ellipsoid shape. To
assess tumor regression by polyI:C, mice were given i.p. saline
or 250 μg of polyI:C weekly for 4 consecutive weeks starting
on day 5 following tumor cell implantation.
Quantitative PCR. To assess the induction of gene expression, mice implanted with TRAMP cells were subjected to
four weekly treatments of saline or 250 μg of polyI:C, and sacrificed 4 h before the final treatment. RNA from splenocytes
prepared by Trizol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions was used to generate cDNA for quantitative realtime PCR using iScript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR;
Bio-Rad). A Bio-Rad iCycler was used to analyze the samples
under the following conditions: 95°C (5 min), 55 cycles of 95°C
(20 s), 55°C (30 s), and 72°C (10 s). The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for
normalization. The quantitative real-time PCR total volume
was 19 μL and consisted of 2 μL cDNA, 8 μL H2O, 8 μL of
2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 1 μL
of a 10 μmol/L oligo set for the following genes: IL-6, 5′-CACAGAGGATACCACTCCCAACA, 3′-TCCACGATTTCCCAGAGAACA; Mx-1, 5′-AAACCTGATCCGACTTCACTTCC, 3′TGATCGTCTTCAAGGTTTCCTTGT; IP-10, 5′-CCAGTGAGAATGAGGGCCATA, 3′-TCGTGGCAATGATCTCAACAC;
IL-15, 5′-CACTTTTTAACTGAGGCTGGCATT, 3′TCCAGTTGGCCTCTGTTTTAGG; IL-1β, 5′-GAGCTGAAAGCTCTCCACCTCA, 3′-TCGTTGCTTGGTTCTCCTTGTAC; TNF-α, 5′-GGTGCCTATGTCTCAGCCTCTT, 3′CGATCACCCCGAAGTTCAGTA; TGFβ, 5′-GCTGCTGACCCCCACTGATA, 3′-CGTCTCCTTGGTTCAGCCAC; IL-12,
5′-CCCATTCCTACTTCTCCCTCAA, 3′-CCTTTCTGGTTACACCCCTCCT; GAPDH, 5′-ACTCCACTCACGGCAAATTCA,
3′-CGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTGAT.
Intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions prepared from spleens were used for flow cytometry.
Intracellular staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Bioscience). Splenocytes were
stained with CD4 (RM4-5), CD25 (PC61.5), and control IgG2a
and IgG1 antibodies at 1:500 dilution for 20 min, and stained
with FoxP3 (FJK-16s) or IgG2a antibodies at 1:200 dilution for
30 min. To assess the induction of effector cells following polyI:
C stimulation in vivo, age-matched 6-wk-old C57Bl6 male mice
were given an i.p. dose of 250 μg of polyI:C at 0, 24, and 48 h
before harvest. Labeled splenocytes were analyzed using BD

FACSCalibur flow cytometry and CellQuest Pro software. Antibodies include antimouse CD8 (53-6.7), CD4 (RM4-5), CD25
(PC61.5), Foxp3 (FJK-16s), NK1.1 (PK136), and the respective
IgG2a and IgG1 controls (eBioscience).
Antibody depletion. NK cell depletion monoclonal antibody clone PK136 was expanded in hybridoma media (Life
Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories) and purified
by precipitation in 50% saturating ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis against PBS. Following implantation of
TRAMP C2 tumor cells in 6-wk-old male C57Bl6 mice, groups
of mice were given 100 μg IgG control antibody or 100 μg
PK136 by i.p. injection starting on days 2, 3, and 4 after tumor
challenge and weekly starting at day 11. Subsequently, i.p. saline or 250 μg of polyI:C was administered weekly for 4 consecutive weeks starting on day 5, with mice sacrificed 4 h
following the final treatment. Splenocytes were analyzed by
flow cytometry, whereas cytokine levels were measured from
serum. NK cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry to
be >95% (data not shown).
ELISA. Serum harvested from cardiac puncture of euthanized animals was used for detecting circulating levels of TGFβ
and IL-6 per the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems).
Immunohistochemistry. Prostate and seminal vesicles
were extracted and fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin
embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm. H&E staining was performed and slides were visualized using an Olympus BX41 microscope and captured using an Olympus DP71 digital
camera and software. For immunohistochemistry, paraffinembedded sections were dissolved in xylene and rehydrated
in graded ethanol. For anti-CD3 (A0452, DAKO) and anti-NK
(Asialo GM1, Cedarlane) staining, antigen retrieval by steaming in 0.01 mol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 25 min
was followed by primary antibody staining at 1:100 and
1:1,000 dilution, respectively, for 60 min. Secondary antibody
staining was performed using an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled polymer (DAKO) for 30 min. AntiCD45R (RA3-6B2, eBioscience) staining was completed at a
1:50 dilution for 2 h. For anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s, eBioscience)
staining, antigen retrieval by steaming in 0.001 mol/L EDTA
(pH 8.0) at 115°C for 3 min was completed followed by primary
antibody staining at a 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h. Secondary antibody staining for both anti-CD45R and anti-Foxp3 included two
steps consisting of a 30-min incubation using a 1:200 dilution
of a rabbit anti-rat antibody (E0468, DAKO), followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit HRP-labeled polymer (DAKO)
for 30 min. Staining was completed by incubation with 3,3′diaminobenzidine for 10 min and hematoxylin counterstaining.

Results
TLR3 regulates prostate tumor growth. To examine the
role of TLR3 in tumor surveillance, we first implanted syngenic
tumor cells in TLR3−/− mice and TLR3+/+ counterparts to observe tumor growth in the absence of exogenous stimulation
of TLR3. Tumors from s.c. implanted TRAMP cells in TLR3−/−
mice grew markedly larger compared with TLR3+/+ mice
(Fig. 1A). Because tumors exhibited enhanced basal growth
in the absence of TLR3, we then assessed the therapeutic

potential of TLR3 agonists. Ligands to TLR3 include dsRNA
or the synthetic polymer polyI:C. Serial i.p. administration of
polyI:C in mice with s.c. implanted TRAMP cells completely
suppressed tumor growth, using a dose previously shown to
induce NK activity and be well tolerated (Fig. 1B; ref. 8).
PolyI:C signals through TLR3 to activate NF-κB, MAPK,
and IRF-3 to induce inflammatory mediators, but may also
activate alternative receptors such as cytoplasmic pattern
recognition receptors retinoic acid–inducible protein I and
melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (17). Furthermore, tumor suppression by polyI:C may be induced not only
by acting on immune cells but also through direct action of
polyI:C on TRAMP cells. To investigate whether polyI:C therapy works through host immune cells, we examined the effect of polyI:C treatment on the tumor growth of implanted
TRAMP cells, containing a TLR3+/+ background, in TLR3−/−
hosts. Only a limited suppression of tumor growth was seen
with sequential treatments by polyI:C, supporting a major
contribution of host TLR3 in modulating tumor growth
(Fig. 1C). To further investigate the direct role of polyI:C
on prostate cancer epithelium, TRAMP C2 cells were stimulated with incremental doses of polyI:C in vitro and proliferation was assessed. Statistically insignificant reductions in

proliferation occurred even at the highest doses of polyI:C,
supporting minimal direct effects of polyI:C on prostate
epithelial tumor cells in our model (Fig. 1D).
Suppression of autochthonous prostate cancer growth in
polyI:C-treated mice. To further assess polyI:C-induced tumor suppression activity in vivo, we used the established murine autochthonous prostate cancer TRAMP model (15).
When crossed with FVB mice, the TRAMP C57Bl6 × FVB F1
Tg+/− transgenic mice develop a more rapidly progressing
phenotype with consistent development of localized adenocarcinoma by 12 weeks. In our studies, 10-week-old mice were
subjected to weekly i.p. administration of polyI:C and sacrificed 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. Examination revealed no gross metastases in the liver, spleen, or lungs in
all animals (data not shown). When compared with salinetreated animals, the prostate, bladder, and seminal vesicles
in the polyI:C-treated group were approximately half the
weight at 16 weeks (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, prostate and seminal vesicles from polyI:C-treated mice at 16 weeks appeared
similar in size to glands from animals of pretreated age at 10
weeks (Fig. 2B).
Under H&E staining, 10-week-old TRAMP C57Bl6 × FVB
prostates contained normal glands juxtaposed with areas of
well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. At 16 weeks, prostates

from TRAMP C57Bl6 × FVB mice showed progression to
moderate and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with
areas involving sheets of anaplastic cells. Strikingly, following
six weekly treatments with polyI:C, minimal progression
compared with 10-week-old TRAMP C57Bl6 × FVB prostates
was observed (Fig. 2C).
Type I IFN–dependent and type I IFN–independent
requirements in polyI:C-mediated tumor inhibition. TLR3
is unique to TLRs in that it transduces its signal exclusively
through TRIF to activate both NF-κB and IRF-3 (18). To differentiate between type I IFN–dependent and type I IFN–
independent functions, we examined the growth of tumors
from s.c. implanted TRAMP cells in IFNAR1−/− mice and
IFNAR1+/+ counterparts and found increased growth in the
absence of IFNAR1 (Fig. 3A). In addition, IFNAR1−/− mice exhibited reduced response to polyI:C-mediated suppression in
the growth of subcutaneous TRAMP tumors (Fig. 3B).
To further investigate type I IFN–dependent mechanisms,
we next examined the gene expression of a panel of inflammatory genes in vivo from IFNAR1+/+ and IFNAR1−/− mice
with s.c. implanted TRAMP tumors in response to i.p.
polyI:C stimulation after 4 hours (19). Categorizing genes
based on dependency on type I IFNs may give insight into
TLR3-mediated effector functions. We found induction of

(IP-10), and IL-15 by polyI:C to be type I IFN dependent,
whereas expression of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-12 was independent of type I IFNs. We also examined the gene induction of
TGFβ, a cytokine important in the development of Treg cells.
Minimal gene induction was observed at 4 hours following
challenge by polyI:C with and without IFNAR1 (Fig. 3C).
Regulation of CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells by NK cells. Previous studies have implicated NK cell activation in response to
TLR3 stimulation to be largely TRIF mediated (8). Consistent
with this finding, we found strong type I IFN–dependent induction of IL-15, a potent activator of NK and T cells (20).
This seems specific to TLR3, as no splenocytic induction of
IL-6 and IL-15 in response to polyI:C was observed in TLR3−/−
mice (data not shown). To confirm the ability of polyI:C to
induce NK cells in vivo, we stimulated C57Bl6 mice with
polyI:C and examined levels of splenocytic CD4+, CD8+, NK,
and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs at 0, 24, and 48 hours after
stimulation. Increased levels of splenocytic NK cells were
observed at 48 hours after polyI:C stimulation (Fig. 4A). To
assess the relevance of NK cells in our model of polyI:Cmediated tumor suppression, we examined the response to
polyI:C upon NK cell depletion using monoclonal antibodies.
Significantly enhanced tumor growth compared with polyI:C
alone was observed with depletion of NK cells (Fig. 4B). This
confirmed previous data supporting a major role for NK cells
in TLR3-mediated antitumor effects (8).
Prior reports have implicated cross-regulation between
NK cells and Tregs. Tregs have been shown to inhibit the den-

www.aacrjournals.org

dritic cell–mediated activation of NK cells, whereas others
have linked a direct inhibitory effect on NK cells to a TGFβdependent mechanism (21, 22). Although IFNγ has been implicated in inhibiting Treg development, little is known about
how activation or depletion of NK cells influences Tregs (23).
When we examined the serum in mice depleted of NK cells in
our tumor suppression model, we found elevated levels of
TGFβ and lower levels of IL-6 from mice depleted of NK cells
and stimulated with polyI:C compared with mice stimulated
with polyI:C alone (Fig. 4C). Consistent with prior gene induction results, no significant elevation of TGFβ levels were observed with polyI:C treatment alone. This suggested that
following depletion of NK cells, the systemic environment
favors the development of Tregs. To investigate further,
we examined the levels of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in the
splenocytes of mice with and without NK depletion in our
polyI:C-induced tumor suppression model. As expected, no
statistically significant increase in Tregs was observed with
polyI:C stimulation alone, but elevated Treg levels were detected with the combination of polyI:C stimulation and NK
cell depletion compared with no treatment (Fig. 4D).
Autochthonous prostate cancer inflammatory infiltrate
in polyI:C-treated mice. To correlate the systemic effects
with the tumor microenvironment, we examined the autochthonous TRAMP tumors for infiltration of inflammatory cells
by immunohistochemistry. We observed that at 10 weeks,
prostates from TRAMP C57Bl6 × FvB F1 Tg+/− mice exhibited
small numbers of infiltrating CD3+ and NK cells, with no
detectable CD45R- and Foxp3-staining cells. As the tumors

progressed at 16 weeks, similar numbers of inflammatory infiltrates were present. Notably, with weekly polyI:C stimulation, a marked influx of CD3+ cells within both the prostate
glands as well as the stroma, and an increase in NK cells in
the prostatic stroma, were observed, with no detectable
CD45R- and rare Foxp3-staining cells (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Originally described as receptors on immune cells responsible for sensing pathogens, TLRs have now been implicated
in broader biological functions. Using the TRAMP orthotopic
and subcutaneous tumor models, we provide evidence for
TLR3 as a sensor in tumor immune surveillance, with the absence of TLR3 leading to accelerated tumor growth without
exogenous stimulation of the receptor. Consistently, activation of TLR3 with exogenous ligand suppressed the growth
of TRAMP tumors. In orthotopic prostate tumors, serial
polyI:C treatments lead to the recruitment of T lymphocytes
and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment, resulting in
a striking suppression of tumor growth both in gross size as
well as histologic progression of adenocarcinoma. We showed
that polyI:C contributes to tumor suppression through a type
I IFN–dependent activation of NK cells, as well as suggests a
cross-regulation of Treg lymphocytes by NK cells.

In our studies, increased growth of wild-type TRAMP tumors in TLR3−/− compared with TLR3+/+ mice implicates
TLR3 expressed by immune cells in mediating tumor surveillance. The question of how TLRs sense tumor cells is
the subject of ongoing investigations, potentially involving
danger-associated molecular patterns released from tumor
cells, such as components of tumor mRNA (24, 25). Although
we did not observe significant differences in TRAMP cell
growth upon direct stimulation with polyI:C, the expression
of multiple TLRs has been shown on prostate epithelial cells,
and recent in vitro studies suggested the potential for direct
apoptotic effects of TLR3 stimulation (26). PolyI:C may
induce autophagy in tumor cells by expression of inflammatory cytokines or apoptosis through a RIP/FADD/caspase-8–
dependent pathway (27). Furthermore, reports have shown
protumor effects of TLR activation on tumor cells by enhancing immune evasion or promoting tumor growth
through tissue repair mechanisms (3, 10, 28). In humans, a
sequence variant in a 3′-untranslated region of TLR4 as
well as polymorphisms in the TLR gene cluster encoding
TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10, and the downstream signaling mediators IRAK1 and IRAK4 confer increased prostate cancer
risk (29–31). How these polymorphisms affect TLR signaling
within the tumor microenvironment have yet to be determined. Whether these mutations affect tumor initiation

TLR3-Mediated Immune Surveillance in Prostate Cancer

or progression of cancers will also be the subject of future
studies.
Although classically involved in antiviral responses, type I
IFNs have been implicated in immune surveillance of tumors
with increased tumor formation in methylcholanthreneinduced sarcomas and growth of syngenic tumor cells in
IFNAR1−/− compared with IFNAR1+/+ mice (14, 32). Endogenous IFN responsiveness in hematopoietic cells has been
shown to be important for anticancer immune responses
(33). The lack of type I IFN responsiveness in IFNAR1−/− mice
encompasses both MyD88-independent type I IFN production
by TLR3 and TLR4 through TRIF as well as MyD88-dependent
type I IFN production by TLR7 and TLR9 through IRF-7. However, the partial tumor suppression by polyI:C in IFNAR1−/−
mice compared with IFNAR1 +/+ mice still implicates the
importance of IFN-independent pathways. We also show
a major contribution of NK cells in polyI:C-mediated
tumor suppression, which may also potentiate the effects of
antigen-specific CD8+ cells (34).
To further discriminate the potential mechanisms of IFNdependent and IFN-independent effector functions, we surveyed the expression of various genes in our tumor model
in IFNAR1+/+ and IFNAR1−/− mice. These genes can be cate-

gorized into families that are dependent and independent on
type I IFNs. We showed IFNAR1-dependent gene induction of
IL-6, IL-15, IP-10, and Mx-1, supporting NK cell proliferation,
and recruitment of activated T and NK cells to areas of inflammation, by IL-15 and IP-10, respectively. In contrast,
gene expression of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-12 was induced by
polyI:C independent of type I IFNs, suggesting a role for
these cytokines in mediating tumor toxicity in the type I
IFN–independent pathways.
We showed that depletion of NK cells led to an increase in
splenic Tregs, showing a balance between immune activation
and immune suppression following acute activation of NK
cells. This suggests that either inhibition of Tregs or direct
activation of NK cells may enhance immune-based tumor
therapies. Suppression of Tregs may be sufficient to break
tolerance or induce anergy to self-antigens and points
to the importance of type I IFNs in the development of
immune-based cancer therapy (35). In patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus, IFNα secreted by antigen-presenting
cells may potentially inhibit Treg activity (36). This is in accordance with clinical observations of elevated levels of Treg cells
in patients with prostate cancer and suppression of human
prostate tumor–infiltrating CD8+ Treg cells by TLR8 in vitro

(37, 38). Alternatively, our findings also suggest that persistent
activation of NK cells may suppress the development of Tregs.
However, following pathogen challenge, induction of Treg
cells may play a critical role in protecting against tissue injury
and inhibiting autoimmunity (6). Thus, activation of TLRs in
cancer therapy may potentially interfere with normal tissue
homeostasis and will need to be carefully monitored.
Our future studies will also focus on the tumor microenvironment, which may differ from systemic activation of cytokines and splenocyte effector cells. Although in response to
polyI:C, we did not observe a decrease in circulating TGFβ
levels or Treg levels, Tregs may still be influenced at the
tumor microenvironment. We have shown recruitment of T
lymphocytes and NK cells within the glands and stroma of
the prostate upon serial polyI:C therapy. Studies will need
to define the kinetics of such infiltration to the tumor microenvironment and use more sensitive approaches to follow
the activation of Tregs and local cytokine levels.
Emerging studies indicate that TLR activation of multiple
inflammatory pathways through the recognition of both
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous
ligands may modulate the development and progression of cancer. We have provided evidence supporting a role of TLR3 in
promoting tumor immune surveillance and the use of TLR3
agonists as immunotherapy in prostate cancer. Although other
TLRs may contribute to tumor progression by overly enhancing inflammation through MyD88-dependent signaling path-

ways, TLR3 may provide an optimal balance of type I IFN
induction and inflammatory cytokine activity. Thus, comparison of type I IFN and proinflammatory effects of different TLRs
in tumor settings deserves further study. With the caveats of
direct stimulation and activation of cancer cells by TLRs and
of disrupting systemic regulation of immune functions, we believe that defining the TLR-dependent pathways responsible
for immune surveillance will contribute to developing novel
therapeutics. At the same time, use of TLR3 agonists may be
promising in suppressing progression of prostate cancer.
