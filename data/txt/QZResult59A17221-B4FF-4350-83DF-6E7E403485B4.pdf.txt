ABSTRACT
Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Although
recent progress in treatment has been achieved, lack of response, drug resistance
and relapse remain major problems. The tumor suppressor p53 is rarely mutated in
melanoma, yet it is inactive in the majority of cases due to dysregulation of upstream
pathways. Thus, we screened for compounds that can activate p53 in melanoma cells.
Here we describe effects of the small molecule MJ25 (2-{[2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2ylsulfonyl)ethyl]thio}-1,3-benzoxazole), which increased the level of p53-dependent
transactivation both as a single agent and in combination with nutlin-3. Furthermore,
MJ25 showed potent cytotoxicity towards melanoma cell lines, whilst having weaker
effects against human normal cells. MJ25 was also identified in an independent screen
as an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), an important selenoenzyme in the
control of oxidative stress and redox regulation. The well-characterized TrxR inhibitor
auranofin, which is FDA-approved and currently in clinical trials against leukemia
and a number of solid cancers, displayed effects comparable with MJ25 on cells and
led to eradication of cultured melanoma cells at low micromolar concentrations.
In conclusion, auranofin, MJ25 or other inhibitors of TrxR1 should be evaluated as
candidate compounds or leads for targeted therapy of malignant melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

tumor-free survival time after treatment has remained less
than one year [5]. Furthermore, a number of countries
have excluded this drug from subsidy within their health
care programs due to a high cost/benefit ratio. Additional
compounds and antibodies for targeted, immuno- as well
as combination therapy have been and are currently being
developed such as the BRAFV600mut inhibitor dabrafenib
[6], mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
inhibitors trametinib [7] and cobimetinib [8], the anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)
antibody ipilimumab [9] as well as anti-programmed cell

Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most
dangerous type of skin cancer and incidence rates have
been rising continuously over the past decades [1, 2].
Vemurafenib (Zelboraf, PLX4032) [3] is approved for the
treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in which
the serine/threonine kinase BRAF has been mutated at
Val600, as is the case in approximately 50% of patients [4].
However, drug resistance and relapse following treatment
with vemurafenib are major problems, and the average

and nivolumab [11]. However, despite promising results
being achieved with these agents, lack of responsiveness
and relapse are still major problems (reviewed in [12, 13]).
Differing from a large number of solid tumors, the
tumor suppressor p53 is rarely mutated in melanoma [1418]. Instead, its function is thought to be abrogated by
other mechanisms, such as overexpression of its negative
regulators murine double minute 2 (mdm2) or mdm4
(mdmx) [19-21]. During the past decade, several classes
of non-genotoxic compounds that can reactivate wild-type
(wt) p53 by inhibiting its interaction with mdm2 and/or
mdm4 have been described (reviewed in [22]). The most
widely tested of these is nutlin-3 [23], a derivative of
which, RG7112 (RO5045337), has been tested in phase
I clinical trials [24, 25]. However, nutlin-3 can lead to
both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects [23, 26-28]. Whilst
cytotoxic effects are desirable, cell cycle arrest can lead to
the recovery of cell populations following drug removal
[28], and may result in relapse. Thus, finding other nongenotoxic p53 activators that specifically lead to death
in tumor cells is desirable. Therefore, we performed a
melanoma cell-based screen to identify compounds that
can activate p53, and subsequently studied the capability
of selected compounds to induce cytotoxicity rather than
cell cycle arrest, in this cell type.
In the present study we describe characteristics
of the non-genotoxic small molecule MJ25
((2-{[2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylsulfonyl)ethyl]thio}-1,3benzoxazole), PubChem compound ID 1319216), named
“MJ25” for screen compound 25. MJ25 was an active
compound in our screen for p53 reactivators, albeit with
low potency. However, as MJ25 was also independently
identified as a hit compound in a recent quantitative highthroughput screen for inhibitors of the selenoprotein
thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), an enzyme of major
importance in cellular redox control [29-31], it was
selected for further characterization. The results of that
screen, based upon a previously described assay [32], have
recently been deposited in PubChem (BioAssay number:
588453; W. Stafford et al., manuscript in preparation).
The combined activities of MJ25 to activate p53 and
simultaneously inhibit TrxR1 were interesting features
from a potential therapeutic perspective and resembled
effects previously noted for compounds such as RITA [33]
and PRIMA-1MET [34]. We therefore wished to study the
cytotoxic properties of MJ25 in melanoma cells.
TrxR1 is a cytosolic antioxidant protein with the
main function of keeping the active site disulfide/dithiol
motif of thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) in a reduced state. TrxR1
thereby supports a wide range of Trx1-dependent cellular
pathways, from providing protection against excessive
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [29, 30, 35] to
modulating several levels of redox regulation and cell
viability [31]. To perform its catalytic function, TrxR1
needs to be present in a reduced state. TrxR1 reduction
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is a multistep process initiated by nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) reducing a flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) moiety. Subsequently, FADH2
reduces the redox-active disulfide motif -CVNVGC- in
the N-terminus of the same subunit of the homodimer,
resulting in a dithiol motif. Finally, this dithiol reduces
the selenium-sulfide motif formed by the cysteine (Cys)
and selenocysteine (Sec) residues in the -GCUG sequence
present in the C-terminus of the other subunit. This
selenolthiol can, in turn, reduce most of the enzyme’s
substrates including Trx1. The C-terminal selenolthiol
motif of the NADPH-reduced enzyme is easily accessible
to substrates and is considered to be the major active site
of the enzyme [36-38]. However, substrates like juglone
(5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, walnut toxin) can be
reduced by the N-terminal FAD/–CVNVGC- motif in a
Sec-independent manner [39].
The growth-stimulatory and anti-apoptotic activities
of TrxR1, as well as its observed upregulation in a number
of tumor types, suggests that inhibition of TrxR1 may
result in tumor growth inhibition [40]. Indeed, various
compounds with Trx- or TrxR1-inhibitory activities have
been described as potential anti-cancer agents [35, 40-42].
Auranofin (Ridaura) is a potent inhibitor of TrxR1 [4350] and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
and is currently being tested for potential anti-cancer
activity in a small number of clinical trials (http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov). However, its activity against malignant
melanoma is not currently being evaluated in those trials.
Here we found that both MJ25 and auranofin inhibit
TrxR1 and are cytotoxic towards melanoma cells. These
compounds also display similarities regarding p53 protein
induction and BRAFV600mut dependence. Our data suggest
that targeting TrxR1 may indeed be a possible therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of melanoma.

RESULTS
MJ25 and its p53 related properties
To identify small molecules that activate wt p53
in melanoma we performed a screen in ARN8 cells
expressing β-galactosidase under the control of a p53dependent promoter. MJ25 (Figure 1a) was identified as
an active compound in this screen, displaying modest p53
activation. As it was also identified as a TrxR1 inhibitor
with an IC50 of 1.122 µM (PubChem BioAssay number:
588453; http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), it was selected
for further analysis. MJ25 was subsequently repurchased
and its activation of p53-dependent transcription
confirmed in ARN8 cells as well as in the T22 cell line,
a murine prostate-derived cell line stably transfected
with the same β-galactosidase reporter gene as ARN8
cells (data not shown) [51]. We also found that MJ25

ARN8 cells when used in combination with nutlin-3,
a well-described specific p53 activator (Figure 1b)
[23], suggesting that the two compounds have different

mechanisms of action. Interestingly, MJ25 induced p53
protein levels in ARN8 cells without increasing p21 levels,
whilst mainly inducing p21 and not p53 in human normal
dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs) (Figure 1c). We found that

which express wt p53 and have been stably transfected with a p53-dependent β-galactosidase expression vector (RGC-ΔFos-LacZ reporter

for 16 hours. p53-dependent transcription was assessed by measurement of β-galactosidase activity, taking protein levels into consideration.

MJ25 reduced the growth of various melanoma cell lines
after 72 hours of treatment, whilst being less toxic to
both HNDFs and human normal epithelial melanocytes
(HNEMs) (Figure 1d). Supporting the observation that
p53 activation by MJ25 was modest, its ability to kill
tumor cells was weakly dependent on the presence of fulllength-p53. A slight decrease in sensitivity was observed
in RKO and HCT116 cell lines deficient in full-length p53
(p53def/def) compared with their p53+/+ isogenic counterparts
(Figure 1e and 1f). The increased levels of p21 levels in
HNDFs and not ARN8 cells (Figure 1c) suggested that
the ability of MJ25 to induce this protein was enhanced
in the absence of activated p53. In support of this finding,
p21 was also strongly induced in p53-null H1299 cells as
well as in H1299 cells stably transfected with mutant p53
(Figure 1g).
p53 activation suggested that MJ25 may act as
a DNA damaging agent, and the presence of a sulfone
group in this compound suggested that it may do so by
DNA mono-alkylation. However, such activity could not

be detected in an assay for DNA alkylation (Figure 2a).
We also determined whether MJ25 increased the levels
of γ-H2AX, which occurs in response to double-strand
breaks (DSBs) [52] and is often used as an indicator of
possible genotoxicity. MJ25 did not induce γ-H2AX in
HNDFs within 9 hours of exposure (Figure 2b) nor at
later times (data not shown). γ-H2AX levels were slightly
increased in ARN8 cells at concentrations of MJ25 that
lead to cytotoxicity in these cells (Figures 1d and 2b). Cell
death driven DNA fragmentation, which can also result
in increased levels of γ-H2AX [53], may account for this
result.

The dependency of MJ25’s cytotoxicity on mutant
BRAF

V600E point mutation in BRAF, a mutation that occurs in
approximately 50% of patients suffering from melanoma

[4]. We therefore tested if the cytotoxic effects of MJ25
were dependent on a constitutively active BRAF pathway.
Both the ARN8 and RKO cell line express BRAFV600E [54,
55], which drives their proliferation and survival [56-58].
As shown in Figure 3a, MJ25 was slightly more potent

at killing tumor cells expressing BRAFV600E than isogenic
cells lacking this mutant protein. Notably, MJ25 was able
to kill ARN8 cells that were co-treated with vemurafenib,
the first inhibitor of BRAFV600E clinically approved for the
treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma [3, 4]

Figure 3: MJ25’s cytotoxic effect is enhanced by mutant BRAF. a. RKO BRAFV600E/V600E/+ and BRAF-/-/+ cells were treated for

concentrations for the indicated periods of time. Changes in protein levels were determined by Western blotting. Stars indicate bands

(Figure 3b). MJ25 was furthermore able to induce cell
death in cells that were largely insensitive to vemurafenib,
achieving almost total cell eradication both as a single
agent and when combined with vemurafenib (Figure 3b).
In contrast, neither single nor combined treatment affected
the clonogenic potential of HNDFs (Figure 3c).
Unlike vemurafenib, MJ25 did not inhibit
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2), which are downstream targets
of BRAF and indicative of BRAF activation (Figure 3d).
Thus, MJ25 is mechanistically different from vemurafenib
and its effects on the BRAF pathway are likely to be
indirect.

TrxR1 expression may indeed explain the transient loss of
TrxR1 inhibition by MJ25 and auranofin as well as the fact
that TrxR1 activity was higher 24 hours post-treatment
compared to its starting activity (i.e. >100%) (Figure 4b).
Of note, the effects of MJ25 on induction of Nrf2 and
its target genes were less persistent over time than those
of auranofin, and the latter caused a significant level of
cell death at the highest dose after 24 hours of treatment
(Figure 4f).
To further study the dependence of MJ25-induced
cytotoxicity on TrxR1 and Trx1-dependent pathways,
ARN8 cells were pre-treated with L-buthionine
sulfoximine (BSO) to deplete intracellular glutathione
(GSH) levels by inhibiting glutathione synthesis (Figure
4g, right panel) [63]. Cell growth decreased approximately
30% upon BSO treatment alone. Co-treatment with
auranofin led to complete eradication of cell populations,
which is in line with the assumption that simultaneous
inhibition of the glutathione and Trx systems will lead to
enhanced cytotoxicity [64]. The cytotoxicity of MJ25 was
less affected by BSO pre-treatment (Figure 4g), which
correlates well with its lower TrxR1-inhibitory capacity in
cell culture compared with auranofin. Of note, glutathione
reductase (GR), the enzyme that converts glutathione
disulfide (GSSG) to its reduced form (GSH), is highly
homologous to TrxR1, in particular in its catalytically
active site, and both enzymes are NADPH- and FADdependent [65, 66]. Therefore, we tested if MJ25 is able
to inhibit GR in vitro. The data presented in Figure 4h
suggest that this is not the case, as MJ25 did not inhibit
the enzyme at any dose tested. Auranofin was tested for
comparison, and inhibition occurred only at concentrations
exceeding those required for having effects on cells.

Inhibition of thioredoxin reductase 1 by MJ25 in
comparison to auranofin
In addition to reactivating wild-type p53, MJ25 was
independently identified as an inhibitor of TrxR1 (see
above). Therefore, we also confirmed that repurchased
MJ25 inhibited recombinant TrxR1 (Figure 4a) and then
tested whether MJ25 inhibited TrxR1 in ARN8 cells
(Figure 4b). When analyzing cells treated with 5 µM
MJ25 we found that the compound transiently inhibited
TrxR activity in cell lysates at 3 hours of treatment, with a
subsequent rebound effect at later time points (Figure 4b).
This effect was also seen with auranofin, a well-described
and very potent TrxR inhibitor (Figure 4a and 4b) [4350]. Such a rebound effect is likely to be nuclear factor
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) dependent [59]. This
is supported by the finding that both MJ25 and auranofin
strongly induce this factor (Figure 4f, see also below).
To further probe if TrxR1 targeting may be a
component of MJ25’s mechanism of action, we increased
the expression of selenoproteins by supplementing the
growth medium with sodium selenite [60]. The effects of
both MJ25 and auranofin on colony-forming capability
were clearly dampened by trace amounts of sodium
selenite (Figure 4c and 4d). Auranofin was more affected
by selenium supplementation than MJ25, suggesting that
auranofin is more selenoprotein dependent than MJ25
(Figure 4a and 4b).
Since TrxR1 plays a key role in the cellular
antioxidant defense [29, 30, 35], we next investigated
whether MJ25 or auranofin induces changes in ROS
levels or upregulates antioxidant pathways. Both MJ25
and auranofin might induce ROS formation, as suggested
by the observed increase in 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) levels (Figure 4e). Treatment of ARN8 cells with
either compound also led to a dose- and time-dependent
induction of nuclear factor Nrf2, a key factor in cellular
antioxidant responses [61, 62], and, to a lesser extent,
increases in the Nrf2 transcriptional targets NAD(P)
H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1), and TrxR1 itself (Figure 4f). This induction of

Electrophilic compounds can easily target the
selenocysteine containing, redox active site of TrxR1
which is located at the C-terminus of the enzyme. Small
molecule inhibition of TrxR1 at the C-terminus is often
irreversible and, depending on the inhibitor, may form

Apoptotic Proteins (SecTRAPs) [67, 68]. SecTRAPs gain
pro-oxidant activities directly in contrast to uninhibited
TrxR1 functions via sustained NADPH consumption
through the N-terminal dithiol motif, actively producing
ROS and inducing cell death despite the derivatized
protein’s inability to reduce the traditional substrates of
TrxR1, such as Trx1 [39]. This unique SecTRAP activity
can be observed through reduction of juglone [39].
Auranofin, an electrophilic compound, was previously
shown to irreversibly inhibit TrxR1 and induce SecTRAP
formation [69, 70]. Here, we found that also MJ25 was

able to irreversibly inhibit TrxR1 (Figure 5a). MJ25,
like auranofin, also sustained SecTRAPs-like redox
cycling activity with juglone as a substrate after complete
inhibition of the C-terminal active site (Figure 5b).

further analyze the effects of auranofin on melanoma
cells. First we confirmed its growth inhibitory activity
towards melanoma cells in several cell lines (Figure 6a).
In a manner similar to MJ25, we also found that auranofin
displayed milder effects on both HNDFs and HNEMs
(Figure 6a). Furthermore, at higher concentrations
auranofin was also able to increase p53 protein levels
in ARN8 cells (Figure 6b), and potent induction of p21
was observed in the absence of wt p53 (Figure 6c).
However, unlike MJ25, auranofin did not induce p21 in
HNDFs (Figure 6b). Interestingly, the manner by which
the p53 status influenced the cytotoxicity of auranofin
was cell line specific. The presence of wt p53 affected
the clonogenic potential of RKO cells (Figure 6d), but
slightly protected HCT116 cells from the drug (Figure
6e). Strikingly, auranofin inhibited rather than stimulated
the transcriptional activity of p53, which was an effect
most clearly illustrated in combination with nutlin-3
(Figure 6f). This finding indicates a major difference in
the cellular responses to auranofin and MJ25. Auranofin

Effects of auranofin on cell viability, p53 activity

[71]. Analyzing those data, it is evident that auranofin
can inhibit cell growth in the majority of cell lines, with
effective doses up to 3 µM (Supplemental Figure S1).
Strikingly, the GI50 value (concentration of drug required
for 50% growth inhibition) was 0.5 µM or less in all of
the melanoma cell lines tested. We therefore wished to

the consequence of DNA fragmentation occurring during

mutant BRAF had been knocked out (BRAF-/-/+) (Figure

auranofin was able to eradicate the entire melanoma cell
population, including cells that were largely insensitive
to vemurafenib (Figure 7c). Notably, however, auranofin

effects of MJ25 are not yet known. However, the effects of
TrxR inhibition, p53 protein induction, ROS production,
Nrf2 induction and preferential cancer cell cytotoxicity
are features evidently shared between the two compounds.
Interestingly, another anticancer drug candidate, RITA,
displays a similar profile of effects with TrxR1 inhibition,
ROS induction and p53 activation [33], suggesting
the potential of a general anticancer principle. Indeed,
non-p53 related effects are difficult to exclude [80].
We also found here that the cytotoxicity caused
by MJ25 and auranofin was slightly BRAF-dependent,
even though the compounds were not direct inhibitors
of the mutant BRAF kinase. Interestingly, BRAFV600E
has previously been shown to induce Nrf2 [81], and
phosphorylation of the BRAF downstream targets ERK1/2
were found here to be induced by treatment of cells with
auranofin, suggesting an intricate web of signaling with
regard to BRAF, p53, Nrf2 and TrxR1 status. Tumor cells
in which the BRAF pathway is constitutively active, due
to the presence of mutant BRAF, generally have a high
rate of proliferation. Therefore, they need to compensate
for the high amounts of ROS produced during frequent
rounds of cell division and a high rate of metabolism.
Thus, disruption of ROS regulation in melanoma cells,
in which the levels of ROS might be quite high already,
might explain why they respond more strongly by
undergoing cell death than their isogenic counterparts in
which the BRAF pathway is not overactive. It should be
noted, however, that TrxR1 inhibition typically induces
Nrf2 [59], as also seen here, suggesting that sub-cytotoxic
doses of auranofin or MJ25 may potentially promote
proliferation and cell viability. Thus, both concentrationand time-dependency should likely be important for a final
outcome using auranofin, MJ25 or other drugs with similar
profiles.
The increase in the levels of phosphorylated
ERK1/2 upon treatment with auranofin may be attributed
to increased ROS levels, as it has been reported previously
that ROS can induce higher levels of phosphorylated
ERK1/2 [82]. Furthermore, our data confirm a previous
study, in which auranofin was shown to induce
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through the generation
of ROS [82]. In contrast, MJ25 was not able to induce
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 despite its ability to induce
ROS. However, MJ25 is less potent than auranofin with
regard to TrxR1 inhibition as well as induction of proteins
involved in the anti-oxidant response, suggesting that
additional pathways modulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2
in different manners when comparing the effects of MJ25
to those of auranofin.
We have found that a significant fraction of ARN8
cells undergo arrest in G1-phase of the cell cycle even at
very high doses of vemurafenib, and that these cells can
recover as soon as the drug has been removed (manuscript
in preparation). This may be related to resistance to
vemurafenib, which is of major concern, even though new

DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrate that MJ25, an inhibitor of
TrxR1 and weak inducer of p53 activity, can efficiently
kill a number of melanoma cell lines, whilst having milder
effects on HNDFs and HNEMs in culture. We also found
auranofin, a more potent TrxR1 inhibitor, to have similar
effects on melanoma cells. However, auranofin and MJ25
display differences with regard to their efficacy, selectivity
between melanoma cells and normal cells, dependence
upon the glutathione system, as well as their effects on
signaling events downstream of p53.
Both MJ25 and auranofin were found to inhibit
TrxR1 irreversibly. It has been suggested earlier that
auranofin can derivatize the Sec residue of TrxR1 due to
its electrophilic nature [69], which should account for the
observed irreversible inhibition. MJ25 carries a sulfone
group, which may be the site where it reacts with its target.
However, this remains to be shown. Interestingly, our data
suggest that MJ25 neither alkylates DNA nor inhibits the
dithiol/disulfide-containing GR, suggesting that Sec may
be the preferential target.
Whilst TrxR1 helps to prevent cellular damage
caused by ROS [29, 35], inhibition of TrxR1 can itself lead
to ROS production by the conversion of the enzyme to a
pro-oxidant NADPH oxidase [68, 72-75]. Increased ROS
levels have been shown to induce p53 expression [76],
which may explain the increase in p53 protein levels upon
treatment with either MJ25 or auranofin. However, only
MJ25 was able to induce p53’s transcriptional activity,
whereas auranofin inhibited the activity of p53, an effect
that was even more obvious in the presence of nutlin-3. An
earlier study suggests that treatment with auranofin may
lead to a conformational change in p53, resulting in the
inability of the latter to bind to its consensus sequence,
and that this conformational change might be caused by
inhibition of the Trx pathway [77]. Since MJ25 is less
potent towards TrxR1 inhibition, only a fraction of the p53
protein molecules may undergo a conformational change.
This, in turn, may also explain why the transcriptional
activity of p53 is not increased proportionally to its protein
levels upon MJ25 treatment. Conversely, we found that
the p53 status could affect the cytotoxicity of auranofin on
tumor cells and their colony-forming capabilities, but in a
cell line dependent manner. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of
MJ25 was similar in two sets of cell lines (HCT116 and
RKO), with MJ25 being more effective in cells expressing
wt p53 than in the respective isogenic p53-deficient cell
lines. The reasons for these qualitative differences in
effects between MJ25 and auranofin are not clear, but
could relate to different off-target or compartmentalization
effects. For example, it is well known that auranofin is
accumulated in mitochondria and first exerts its effects
there [45, 48, 49, 78, 79], while differential organellar

treatment schedules may reduce or overcome this problem
[83]. The data presented here confirm that even high doses
of vemurafenib could not lead to complete eradication of
melanoma cell populations. Importantly, auranofin led to
complete cell killing without any traces of cells recovering
from treatment. Melanoma cells are very sensitive to
changes in ROS, which may be part of the explanation
of these effects. Induction of ROS has indeed been
proposed as an effective way of killing melanoma cells,
especially of those that are resistant to BRAF inhibitors
like vemurafenib [84]. Because both MJ25 and auranofin
were here found to have milder effects in normal cells
than in melanoma cells with regard to cell viability, this
suggests a certain cancer cell selectivity, even though the
clonogenic potential of HNDFs was significantly affected
by auranofin. However, the FDA approval of auranofin
(Ridaura) as an anti-rheumatic agent and its use in current
clinical trials for cancer treatment show that the drug can
be tolerated by patients.
The molecular mechanisms for the differences
between MJ25 and auranofin require further investigation.
Importantly, the potency of MJ25 was not significantly
improved by GSH depletion, which was in stark contrast
to that of auranofin. This suggests that MJ25 and/
or auranofin may have different other targets beyond
TrxR1, the inhibition of which may contribute to death
of melanoma cells. A search in PubChem revealed that
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A1 may be inhibited
by MJ25 at sub-micromolar concentrations (BioAssay
number: 1030). The ALDH superfamily consists of 19
genes in humans, and some members have been shown to
play a role in cancer stemness [85]. In particular, ALDHs
may be involved in cancer stemness in melanomas [86],
and ALDH1A1 has been identified as one of the key
ALDH isozymes involved in this process [87]. Thus, we
investigated if MJ25 kills melanoma cells via inhibition
of ALDH1A1 by comparing the effects of MJ25 on
p53 activation, cell growth and clonogenic potential to
those of disulfiram, which is an inhibitor of ALDH1 and
ALDH2 [88] and approved for the treatment of alcoholism
[89]. However, since disulfiram neither activated the
transcriptional activity of p53 nor showed any selectivity
in clonogenic assays comparing ARN8 cells with HNDFs
(data not shown), we concluded that inhibition of ALDH,
or in particular ALDH1A1, cannot be the key mechanism
for selective cytotoxic effects of MJ25. Thus, it remains
to be determined which other target(s) or mechanism(s)
of MJ25 elicit its effects in a manner independent of the
GSH status of cells.
Due to its poor solubility, MJ25 has not yet been
tested in vivo. Chemical modification of the compound
to increase its solubility would be a preferable next
step in development of the compound as a potential
anticancer drug candidate, combined with structureactivity relationship (SAR) studies. In contrast, auranofin
has already been clinically approved for the treatment of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rheumatoid arthritis. With clinical trials testing auranofin
against a number of different types of cancer currently
being performed (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) but
melanoma not being amongst them, we suggest that
auranofin might be a good drug candidate also for the
treatment of melanoma.

as described previously [94]. Cells were treated at the
indicated concentrations for 16 hours and β-galactosidase
activity was normalized to protein concentrations.

and air-dried. Subsequently, plates were stained with
0.4% SRB (w/v) in 1% acetic acid (v/v) for 30 min at
room temperature (RT). Plates were de-stained by four
sequential washes in 1% acetic acid. After air-drying,
stained proteins were solubilized with 10 mM unbuffered
Tris. Plates were shaken at medium speed for 5-30 min
and absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a VersaMAX
microplate reader (Molecular Devices) using the SoftMax
Pro software.
To determine the effects of BSO, ARN8 cells were
seeded at 200,000 cells per T25 flask in the presence of
BSO [0.25 mM] or vehicle (sterile-filtered MilliQ water)
for 72 hours. Afterwards, cells were trypsinized and
each 10% of the cells transferred to a separate vial for
determination of intracellular GSH levels (see separate
subsection below). The remaining cells were counted
and seeded at 500 cells per well into 96-well plates. After
cell attachment, approx. 2 hours after seeding, MJ25 or
auranofin were added at the indicated concentrations for
another 72 hours. Cell viability was assessed by SRB
assay as described above.

Activities of purified TrxR1 were assessed by the
direct NADPH-dependent DTNB reduction assay [101]
and juglone reduction assay [39]. For this, recombinant
selenocysteine-containing rat (Rattus norvegicus) TrxR1
(15 nM; ≈20 U/mg) produced as described [102], was
incubated with 250 µM NADPH, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and
various concentrations of compounds. All experiments
were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates and analyzed
using a Spectramax microplate reader (Molecular Devices)
using the SoftMax Pro software. Reference samples were
treated with vehicle instead of active compound and were
set as 100% activity, and no enzyme controls were used as
blank references.
For purified TrxR1 inhibitory activity, 15 nM of
NADPH-reduced TrxR1 was incubated with compounds
for 15 minutes at RT. Following this pre-incubation step,
2.5 mM DNTB was added to each well and the linear
increase in absorbance at 412 nm was followed for 90
seconds. For comparison to GR inhibitory activity, 2 nM
of NADPH-reduced GR was incubated with compounds
for 15 minutes at RT. Following this pre-incubation step,
10 mM of GSSG was added to each well and the linear
decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 90
seconds.
Irreversible inhibition of TrxR1 was determined
incubating 300 nM NADPH-reduced TrxR1 in the
presence of compounds (2% DMSO) for 90 minutes.
Aliquots of inhibited enzyme were used in a TrxR1DTNB activity assay to determine native enzyme activity.
The inhibited enzyme samples were subsequently desalted
over a 30,000 molecular weight cutoff desalting column
and activity was again determined using the DTNB assay.
Differential TrxR1 activities were determined after a
90 minute incubation, using juglone as a Sec-independent
substrate and the DTNB assay as a Sec-dependent activity
control. For the juglone assay, 10 µl of sample was added
to Tris-EDTA buffer containing 250 µM NADPH and 100
µM juglone, and NADPH consumption was followed
at an absorbance of 340 nm. 10 µl of the same master
mix was additionally used to confirm complete inhibition
of the selenocysteine active site using the DTNB assay.
Concentrations were used to fully inhibit the Secdependent redox activity of TrxR1.

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 6-well
plates and treated on the following day as indicated.
When compounds were combined, they were added
simultaneously to the cells. After 72 hours, compounds
were removed, the cells washed twice with growth
medium, and fresh growth medium was added. Cells were
let grow for 4 to 13 days. Afterwards, they were washed
twice with PBS and fixed with methanol/acetone (1/1) at
-20°C overnight up to 3 days. Subsequently, plates were
air-dried and stained with Giemsa solution (7.5% (cancer
cell lines) or 15% (HNDFs) in PBS, respectively) for 5
min at RT followed by two washes in lukewarm tap water
and air-drying.

In vitro DNA alkylation assay
MJ25’s DNA alkylating capacity was assessed
according to methods described in [100]. In brief,
supercoiled pHOT1 DNA was mixed with the respective
compound in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
and incubated at 24°C for 6 or 24 hours, respectively.
DMEDA was added at a final concentration of 100 mM
and the mixture was subsequently incubated at 37°C for
1.5 hours. Afterwards, samples were loaded on a 0.5%
agarose gel (w/v) containing 0.5% ethidium bromide (v/v).
Pictures were taken with the GelDoc system (Bio-Rad).
Chlorambucil served as positive control.

Determination of cellular TrxR1 activities
The “endpoint” Trx1-dependent insulin disulfide
reduction assay was used to measure activities of TrxR1
in cell lysates, as described elsewhere [101]. Briefly, 10 µg
protein of crude cell lysate was incubated in the presence
of 1.3 mM NADPH, 275 µM insulin, 10 µM recombinant
human Trx1 (kindly provided by Arne Holmgren,
16501

Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) and 12.5 mM
EDTA in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 40 minutes at
37°C in a 96-well plate. Following this incubation, 7.2
mM guanidine-HCl containing 1 mM DTNB was added
to each well to stop the reaction and detect thiolate groups
with DTNB. Absorption was thereupon read at 412 nm
on a 96-well Spectramax microplate reader (Molecular
Devices) using the SoftMax Pro software. Background
absorbance values using lysates incubated in parallel in
the same reaction mixture without Trx1 were subtracted,
and activities were given as percentages of cells treated
with vehicle alone. DMSO treated cells were used at 100%
activity controls, with samples lacking Trx1 in the reaction
mixture serving as blank controls.
