ABSTRACT
Herein, we investigated therapeutic potential of a novel histone lysine
demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, NCL1, in prostate cancer. Hormone-sensitive prostate
cancer cells, (LNCaP) and castration resistant cancer cells (PC3 and PCai1) were
treated with NCL1, and LSD1 expression and cell viability were assessed. Prostate
cancer cells showed strong LSD1 expression, and cell viability was decreased by NCL1.
ChIP analysis showed that NCL1 induced H3K9me2 accumulation at the promoters
of androgen-responsive genes. NCL1 also induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
In addition, autophagosomes and autolysosomes were induced by NCL1 treatment
in LNCaP. Furthermore, LC3-II expression was significantly increased by NCL1 and
chloroquine. In mice injected subcutaneously with PCai1 and intraperitoneally with
NCL1, tumor volume was reduced with no adverse effects in NCL1-treated mice.
Finally, LSD1 expression in human cancer specimens was significantly higher than that
in normal prostate glands. In conclusion, NCL1 effectively suppressed prostate cancer
growth without adverse events. We suggest that NCL1 is a potential therapeutic agent
for hormone-resistant prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

development and finding new therapeutic options are
clinically necessary.
Prostate cancer development is a multistep process
that results from changes in genetic mechanisms. Recently,
it has become apparent that not only genetic mutations
but also epigenetic alterations lead to the activation of
oncogenes and the loss of function of tumor suppressor
genes. Since epigenetic abnormalities in DNA methylation
patterns as well as histone modifications are potentially
reversible in contrast to gene mutations, much effort has
been directed toward understanding the mechanisms of
epigenetic aberration to develop new therapy. Indeed,
inhibitors of histone deacetylases, such as vorinostat
and romidepsin, and DNA methyltransferases, such as
azacytidine have been clinically approved for treatment of

Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently
diagnosed cancers in the Western world. There are
many therapeutic options against localized prostate
cancer. However, in advanced cancers, most tumors
ultimately relapse after a period of initial response to
therapy and progress to metastatic cancer [1], for which
effective therapeutic procedures are extremely limited.
Administration of docetaxel has been established as a
new standard of chemotherapy for those patients [24]. However, it is not curative, and optimal timing
of administration remains controversial. Therefore,

certain types of cancers [5-8], and there were some reports
about inhibitors of histone deacetylases for prostate cancer
in basic research [9, 10].
The N-terminal tails of histones are subjected
to several types of post-translational modifications,
including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation
[11]. The combination of these modifications determines
chromatin structure and transcriptional activation or
repression of genes. These modifications are regulated by
two classes of enzymes with opposing activities: histone
methyltransferases and histone lysine demethylases
(LSD). LSD1 is the first of this type of enzyme that
was found to belong to the flavin adenine dinucleotide
dependent enzyme family. LSD1 functions as a histone
demethylase that removes mono- and dimethyl, but not
trimethyl marks from either lysine 4 or 9 of histone H3
(H3K4 and H3K9, respectively) [12].
Previous studies showed that the expression of
LSD1 positively correlates with the malignancy of
various organs [13-17]. The members of the amine oxidase
family also impair the activity of LSD1. However, many
of these amine oxidase inhibitors including clorgyline,
pargyline, tranylcypromine (PCPA), polyamines and
derivatives thereof do not selectively target LSD1 [13,
18], which limits their use as therapeutics owing to
potential side effects. In the previous study, we developed
a novel and selective LSD1 inhibitor called NCL1
(N-[(1S)-3-[3-(trans-2-Aminocyclopropyl)phenoxy]1-(benzylcarbamoyl)propyl] benzamide) by combining
protein structure similarity clustering and in vitro
screening [19]. NCL1 impairs LSD1 demethylase activity
and blocks cell proliferation in prostate cancer, glioma,
and breast cancer cell lines [20, 21]. However no report
has described the effects of NCL1 treatment using an in
vivo model for prostate cancer.
In this study, we examined the LSD1 status in
prostate cancer cell lines and human prostatectomy
specimen. In addition, we tested the therapeutic
significance of NCL1 in prostate cancer cells in vitro
and in an in vivo subcutaneous model. Furthermore, we
investigated the pharmacological mechanism of NCL1
using ChIP assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting
analyses. We are the first to find that treatment with NCL1
to inhibit LSD1 induced cell death through regulation of
autophagy in prostate cancer.

the protein expression level of LSD1 was not changed
after NCL1 treatment (Fig. 1A). To determine whether
LSD1 inhibition influences gene specific methylation
status, LNCaP cells treated with NCL1 were subjected to
ChIP assay. Consistent with our previous report, NCL1
specifically impaired the demethylation of H3K9me2 at
the androgen-response elements containing promoters
of ETS domain-containing protein 4 (ELK4) and
kallikrein 2 (KLK2) genes (Fig. 1B). Cell proliferation
assay revealed that prostate cancer cell proliferation
following NCL1 treatment was significantly decreased
in a dose-dependent manner in all cancer cell lines (Fig.
1C). These results indicated that NCL1 has the ability to
attenuate demethylation of H3K9me2 to regulate androgen
responsive genes. On the other hand, the proliferation rate
after NCL1 treatment was also significantly reduced in a
dose-dependent manner in PrEC, a normal prostate cell
line that expresses LSD1 and androgen receptor (AR).
However, the effect in PrEC was much weaker than in
prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 5A, 5B). Therefore, NCL1
has the potential to suppress cell proliferation, with higher
sensitivity in cancer cells as compared to normal cells.

NCL1 inhibits LNCaP cell growth by apoptotic
and growth arrest mechanisms
To explore the underlying mechanisms of NCL1
induced growth inhibition, we evaluated the profiles of
proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle after NCL1
treatment in LNCaP cells. Reflecting the attenuation of
LSD1, the expression of ELK4 and KLK2 were reduced,
but the expression of AR and prostate specific antigen
(PSA) were not changed (Fig. 2A). Treatment with NCL1
resulted in a marked reduction in the expression of cyclin
D1 and elevation in cleaved caspase 3 with no alteration
in caspase 3 expression. Examination of cell cycle-related
proteins showed that cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)
2 and CDK4 expression were decreased, while those of
p21WAF and p27KIP were increased by NCL1 treatment
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, cell cycle and viacount analyses by
the Guava® assay were performed. As a result, we found
that NCL1 treatment of LNCaP cells led to significant
accumulation in the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2B) and induction
of apoptosis (Fig. 2C) in a dose-dependent manner. These
results suggested that selective attenuation of LSD1 using
NCL1 inhibits cell proliferation by caspase dependent
apoptosis and cell growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase in a
cyclin D1-dependent manner. Next, to clarify the selective
inhibitory effect of LSD1, we knocked down LSD1 using
siRNA in LNCaP cells. Attenuation of LSD1 by siRNA
caused significant reduction of cell growth compared with
negative control (NC) transfection. However, treatment
with NCL1 induced no further inhibitory effects on LSD1silenced LNCaP, while NCL1 significantly inhibited cell
growth in NC-transfected LNCaP (Fig. 2D). These results

the efficacy of NCL1-induced cell growth inhibition
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescent staining
further revealed that the cytoplasmic expression of LC3II was significantly increased in NCL1- and CQ-treated
cells as compared to control (Fig. 3C, 3D). By TEM,
autophagosomes were clearly observed 3h after treatment
with NCL1, and autolysosomes were strongly observed
24h after treatment (Fig. 3E). These morphological
features clearly reflect the classical characteristics of
autophagy [23-25]. These results suggest that NCL1
has the potential to induce cancer cell death through
the regulation of autophagy potentiate in addition to the
regulation of apoptotic anticancer pathway.

NCL1 potentially regulates autophagy to induce
cell death in LNCaP cells
As conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and formation
of LC3 puncta have been generally used as indicators
of autophagy [22], we employed them to determine
whether NCL1 treatment induced autophagy in prostate
cancer cells. By western blotting analyses, we found that
NCL1 induced an increase of LC3-II levels in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, to confirm the contribution of
NCL1 to autophagy, we inhibited the autophagic flux with
chloroquine (CQ), which raises the pH within the lumen
of lysosomes and/or autolysosomes thereby compromising
autophagic degradation. It was revealed by western
blotting analysis that CQ induced LC3-II expression, and
addition of NCL1 led to a further accumulation of LC3-II.
By WST assay, CQ alone didn’t have an effect on LNCaP

kg or 1.0 mg/kg of NCL1. As a control, a group of mice
were treated with 10 mg/kg tranylcypromine (PCPA),
a broad spectrum LSD1 inhibitor. Tumor growth was
significantly inhibited in the 1.0 mg/kg NCL1 treated
group as compared to the vehicle controls (Fig. 6A).
NCL1 did not affect other organs and body weight. There
were no differences in the relative weight of organs and
blood examination between the 4 groups, except for
the increased relative liver and kidney weights in the
PCPA group (Table 1A, 1B). By immunohistochemical
analysis, the representative expression patterns of LSD1
in major organs, including normal prostate, testis,
kidney, lung, liver, and brain, in the vehicle control
group are demonstrated in Fig. 5C-N. NCL1 did not
induce any tissue damage in these organs (data not
shown). Microscopically, vacuolization was increased
in a dose-dependent manner in the NCL1 treated groups

compared with the vehicle control group (Fig. 6D, 6E).
To verify the results of the in vitro study, the mechanisms
of attenuation of tumor growth by NCL1 in vivo were
examined using TUNEL assay. Administration of NCL1
significantly increased the appearance of TUNEL-positive
cells, and thus apoptosis, compared with vehicle control
and PCPA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B, 6F,
6G). In addition, we examined tumor vascularity using
immunohistochemistry of CD31. We found that CD31positive vessels were significantly decreased in NCL1
treated tumors (Fig. 6C, 6H, 6I). In addition, western
blotting analysis revealed that the expression of LC3- II
was increased in the NCL1 treatment group as compared
to the vehicle controls (Fig. 6J). These results suggested
that NCL1 decreased tumor vascularity, and induced cell
death through the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy
both in vitro and in vivo.

DISCUSSION

LSD1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis
that deregulation of LSD1 represses prostate cancer
progression and evaluated the therapeutic effect of
targeting this molecule using a novel selective LSD1
inhibitor, NCL1, originally developed at our institute
[19]. Inhibition of LSD1 by NCL1 resulted in an increase
in promoter-specific H3K9me2 modifications (Fig. 1B),
and induced decreases in the protein expression of KLK2
and ELK4 (Fig. 2A). NCL1 not only had significant
growth inhibitory properties in vitro (Fig. 1C), but it
also attenuated tumor growth in vivo at extremely low
concentration levels as compared to previous LSD1
inhibitors (Fig. 6A). In addition, side effects were not
observed at all by both general condition and blood

To determine the status of LSD1 in human
prostate cancer, LSD1 expression was examined by
immunohistochemistry, and the staining intensity was
scored using prostate cancer tissue arrays that contain
tumors with different Gleason patterns as well as normal
prostate tissues. Our findings demonstrated that LSD1
expression was significantly higher in tumor cells of
prostate cancer tissues than in the luminal cells of normal
prostate glands, and its expression level in Gleason pattern
5 tumors was slightly higher than those of other Gleason
patterns, although the differences were not significant
(Fig. 7A-E).

examination (Table 1). Therefore, we demonstrated the
potential safety and utility of NCL1 as a therapeutic
option. This is the first report to test the therapeutic
potential of NCL1 in vivo by using a prostate cancer
model.
LSD1 is involved in the regulation of broad
gene expression programs in many malignancies [1317]. We observed high protein expression of LSD1 in
prostate cancer cells (Fig 1A, 5A), and the inhibition of
LSD1 activity using NCL1 reduced cell proliferation in
vitro (Fig. 1C, 2D, 4E). It has been reported that LSD1
inhibitors preferentially kill transformed or cancer cells in
both cell culture and animal models [15, 19-21], however,
the mechanisms by which LSD1 inhibitors induce cell

death are not well understood. In this report, we found
that NCL1 induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo
(Fig. 2A, 2C, 4A, 4D, 6B, 6F, 6G). Cell death occurs
through apoptosis or non-apoptosis, however, a lack of
a strict definition for apoptosis often lead to controversy.
How the cells die is determined whether they are
apoptosis-reluctant or apoptosis-prone [26, 27]. Recently,
autophagy, an alternative pathway of programmed cell
death to apoptosis, plays an important role in cell death
induced by HDAC inhibitor [25], but there has been no
report on autophagy stimulated by LSD1 inhibition in
prostate cancer cells. Cell death induced by apoptosis and
autophagy frequently occur in parallel, however caspases
are not required for autophagic cell death, and autophagic

activity was found to be suppressed in malignant tumors
[23, 24, 28]. To date, the most convincing and standard
method to detect autophagy is to examine the ultrastructure
of cells by TEM [24]. We investigated drug-induced
autophagy in LNCaP cells using TEM and western blotting
to detect LC3-II expression, which is a non-specific
autophagic marker (Fig. 3A-E). Our results demonstrated
that NCL1 induced autophagy in LNCaP cells in a
concentration dependent manner, which correlated well
with their cytotoxic effects. It is generally accepted that
autophagy exerts a tumor suppression function [24, 29] as
a pro-death process, at least in cancer cells with defective
apoptosis machinery [30]. When autophagy was inhibited
by CQ, the anti-tumor effect of NCL1 was reinforced. So,
this suggests that autophagy in cancer cells is a protective
reaction to anti-tumor agents, and a disrupted autophagy
pathway may enhance the cytotoxicity of LSD1 inhibitor
in prostate cancer cells.
LSD1 plays a key role in many physiological
functions, and recent studies suggested that knock down
of LSD1 reduces cell growth by affecting expression of
several genes involved in proliferation including p21,
cyclin A2, and v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia
viral oncogene homolog 2, and promotes cell cycle
arrest [17, 31-33]. In our study, we found that NCL1
induced cyclin D1 dependent cell cycle arrest in vitro
(Fig 2A, 2B). The CDK inhibitors, p21WAF1 and p27KIP,
negatively modulate cell cycle progression by inhibiting

the activity of cyclin/CDK complexes and block DNA
replication by binding to the proliferating cell nuclear
antigen [34-37]. The most recognized function of CDKs
is phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) that is in
a complex with the transcription factor E2F [35, 38].
Rb hyperphosphorylation in late G1 phase disrupts its
association with various E2F family members, allowing
the coordinated transcription of numerous genes whose
products are necessary for DNA synthesis. In the present
study, NCL1 significantly increased p21WAF1 and p27KIP
protein expression, and decreased CDK2, CDK4 and
cyclin D1 in LNCaP cells in concentrations within their
cytotoxic ranges. These effects would result in a decrease
of E2F or phosphorylated Rb which is a downstream target
of this pathway. In addition, interestingly, the inhibitory
mechanisms of cancer growth by NCL1 appeared to be
related not only to the direct effects on cell proliferation
but also angiogenesis, as confirmed by a reduction in CD
31-positive vessels in vivo (Fig. 6C, 6H, 6I).
WST assay revealed that the 50% attenuation rate
of cell growth in LNCaP was less than 30 μM NCL1,
while that of PCai1 and PC3 was about 50 μM. LNCaP
is a hormone naïve prostate cancer cell line, but PC3 and
PCai1 are castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines.
Therefore, the reason for this altered response may be
partly due to the more aggressive and resistant phenotype
of the latter cells. In PrEC cells, the 50% attenuation rate
of cell growth was over 100 μM NCL1, which indicated

that NCL1 was substantially less effective in normal
prostate cells. To examine the effect of NCL1 in castration
resistant cells, we performed the same in vitro analyses
in PCai1 as in LNCaP. As seen in LNCaP, LSD1 siRNA
treatment reduced cell viability of PCai1, and cell viability
was not affected by NCL1 treatment in LSD1 siRNAtransfected PCai1 unlike in NC-transfected PCai1. The
mechanism of growth inhibitory effect was via caspase
dependent apoptosis and autophagy (Fig. 4A-E), but the
cell cycle was not involved in the anti-tumor effect of
NCL1 in PCai1 unlike in LNCaP (Fig. 4A).
For therapeutic application, validation of the
therapeutic and the toxic efficiencies in vivo is required.
Tumorigenesis of PCai1 cells in vivo was stronger than
that of LNCaP, therefore, to demonstrate the effect of
NCL1 in prostate cancer, we used PCai1 in the in vivo
study. We found that NCL1 suppressed the proliferation of
PCai1 xenografts by induction of apoptosis and autophagy
(Fig. 6). No reports have described LSD1 expression in the
major organs of mouse. Therefore, to understand the effect
of NCL1 in mice, we performed immunohistochemical
analyses in the in vivo study. The expression of LSD1
protein was highly valuable in the different mouse organs,
ranging from weak to strong (Fig. 5C-N). However,
regardless of the level of LSD1 expression, NCL1 had
no toxic effect in not only normal prostate glands, but
also other tissues (data not shown). There were some
related reports suggested other treatments that modulate
apoptosis/autophagy such as CQ enhanced the growth
inhibition in prostate cancer [39-41]. These results suggest
that NCL1 can be used as a novel curative drug for
prostate cancer. Further, when used in combination with
autophagy regulation drugs, NCL1 may be more effective
in suppression of prostate cancer growth.
In two reports, high expression of LSD1 in prostate
cancer was shown to be a predictive marker for aggressive
tumor biology and tumor recurrence during therapy [13,
14]. Our immunohistochemical analyses using tissue
arrays consisting of Japanese prostatectomy specimens
also demonstrated that LSD1 expression was significantly
higher in cancer cells of tumor tissues than in normal
prostate luminal cells (Fig. 7A-D). The expression level of
LSD1 in Gleason pattern 5 tumors tended to be higher than
that in Gleason pattern 3/4 cases (Fig. 7E). In addition,
cell growth of PCai1 cells, which are able to grow under
castration-resistant conditions [42], was effectively
suppressed by NCL1 both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore,
NCL1 might have therapeutic potential for aggressive
forms of human prostate cancer such as castration-resistant
tumors. Further studies are needed to clearly test its in vivo
potential in combination with hormonal therapy.
In summary, NCL1 effectively suppressed prostate
cancer growth in vitro, and had strong efficacy without
adverse events in vivo via regulation of apoptosis and
autophagy. Further, human prostate cancers were found to
harbor strong expression of LSD1. Therefore, our findings
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that NCL1 is a novel potential therapeutic agent
for castration resistant prostate cancer.

METHODS
Cell culture and treatments
The human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and
PC3, the human normal prostate cell line, PrEC, purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA), and an originally established castration resistant
rat prostate cancer cell line, PCai1, were cultured as
described previously [42, 43]. PCPA was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO). NCL1 was
synthesized as previously described [19].
LNCaP, PC3, PCai1, and PrEC cells were treated
with vehicle containing DMSO that was equal in
concentration to 100 μM NCL1 or with 1-100 μM NCL1
for 48h to determine its effect on cell growth. LNCaP and
PCai1 cells were treated with 50 μM NCL1 and/or 40
μM CQ for 24h to assess the autophagic effects on cell
proliferation.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation rates were measured by using the
WST-8 Cell Counting Kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in 96-well
microplates. Prostate cancer cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (5 × 103 cells/well) in DMEM medium containing
10% FBS. After an overnight incubation, growth rate was
determined by using the WST tetrazolium dye, which is
reflected by the rate of dye absorption.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
LNCaP cells were cultivated for 210 min in the
presence or absence of 30 μM NCL1 as indicated. Then,
cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde, and the
chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation using
an H3K9-me2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA). Isotype-specific IgG was used as a
control. Extracted DNA was dissolved in TE buffer and
subjected to real-time PCR using ELK4 and KLK2 specific
primers: ELK4 F- GGGTGATGAACGAAGGCTTG,
ELK4 R- CTCCAGAGCAGACTTAGCTG; and KLK2
F-ACCCCTGTTGCTGTTCATCCTG,
KLK2
RCCGCCCTTGCCCTGTTGG.

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in SDS buffer, and 10 µl of
protein was resolved in 12% polyacrylamide gels and
2874

transferred onto Hybond ECL membranes (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway NJ). ELK4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), KLK2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin B1
(Santa Cruz), cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz), CDK2 (Santa Cruz),
CDK4 (Santa Cruz), caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), cleaved
caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), prostate specific antigen
(PSA) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), AR (Santa Cruz),
p21WAF1(Cell Signaling), p27KIP (Santa Cruz), and LC3II (Abcam) antibodies were used to assess their protein
expression levels. Beta actin expression was evaluated
to confirm equal amount of protein loading using a
monoclonal anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).

15 min followed by a lead staining solution for 5 min.
Sections were examined with a JEM-1011J (JEOL, Tokyo,
Japan) electron microscope at 80KV.

Fluorescent immunocytochemistry analysis
LNCaP cells were incubated with or without 40 μM
CQ, and with or without 50 μM NCL1 for 24h, fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature
and blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum, 0.3
M glycine, 1% BSA and 0.1% tween-20 for 2h at room
temperature. Staining of the treated cells with anti-LC3II antibody was performed overnight at 4°C in PBS
containing 1% BSA and 0.1% tween-20. An anti-rabbit
polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at 1/250 dilution was used
as the secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI and shown in blue. Fluorescence images were
observed and collected using A1 RSi multifunctional
microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analysis software.

Flow cytometry analysis
LNCaP cells (2 × 105) were treated with NCL1 for
72h then cell suspensions were prepared and stained with
Guava® ViaCount reagent and propidium iodide according
to the Guava® Assay protocol (Guava Technologies,
Hayward, CA). Apoptotic analysis and cell cycle
phase distributions were determined on a Guava® PCA
Instrument using the CytoSoft Software.

In vivo studies using a subcutaneous PCai1 model
Six-week-old male KSN/nu-nu nude mice were
obtained from Nippon SLC and maintained as previously
described [42]. PCai1 cells were cultured in T-75 flasks to
confluence, trypsinized, and enumerated. Under isoflurane
anesthesia 1 × 106 PCai1 cells resuspended in 100 μL
serum-free DMEM were injected subcutaneously into
the dorsal side of the lumber vertebrae of mice without
using matrigel. Then, intraperitoneal injection of vehicle
containing DMSO that was equal in concentration to 1.0
mg/kg NCL1 (n=10), 10 mg/kg PCPA (n=5), or 0.5 mg/
kg (n=10) or 1.0 mg/kg (n=10) NCL1 was performed 2
times per week. The amount of drug administration was
determined on the basis of the in vitro WST-8 study. If
we assume that NCL1 was uniformly distributed in the
body, 1.0 mg/kg NCL1 would correspond to about 2.1
μM which was similar to the IC50 of NCL1 in a previous
report [19]. Intraperitoneal injection started 4 days after
tumor inoculation. Tumor size (determined by caliper
measurement) and body weight were measured 2 times per
week, and mice were sacrificed 9 weeks after the injection
of cells.
All animal experiments were performed under
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Nagoya City University School of
Medical Sciences, and the approval number was H24M58.

siRNA transfection in vitro and cell growth assay
Stealth Select RNAi targeting rat and human
LSD1 sequences were obtained (Sigma Aldrich). LNCaP
(2 × 105) and PCai1 (5 × 104) cells were seeded in sixwell plates and transfected with 30 nM siRNA using
LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Silencer
negative control siRNA with no significant homology to
any known rat and human genes was used as a negative
control. The ability of siRNA to silence LSD1 protein
expression was checked on the third day after transfection.
Four days after transfection, 30μM NCL1 or vehicle was
added. For monitoring growth inhibition, cells were
trypsinized on day 7 after transfection, and then the cell
numbers were counted.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well plates (3 × 105
cells/well) in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. After
an overnight incubation, cells were treated with or without
50 μM NCL1 for 3 or 24h, and samples were pre-fixed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) at 4°C. After fixation the specimens were post-fixed
with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) for 45 min. They were subsequently dehydrated in
a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin.
Ultra-thin sections were cut using an ULTRACUT-S
(LEICA, Wetzlar, Germany) with a diamond knife, and
stained with 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water for
