BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to develop a pretreatment prognostic model for patients with unresectable and/or
metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with first-line, cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Individual data were pooled
from 399 patients who were enrolled on 8 phase 2 and 3 trials evaluating cisplatin-based, first-line chemotherapy in patients with
metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Variables selected for inclusion in the model were combined in a Cox proportional hazards model to
produce a points-based nomogram with which to predict the median, 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival. The nomogram was validated
externally using data from a randomized trial of the combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin plus cisplatin versus docetaxel plus cisplatin. RESULTS: The median survival of the development cohort was 13.8 months (95% confidence interval, 12.1 months16.0 months); 68.2% of the patients had died at the time of last follow-up. On multivariable analysis, the number of visceral metastatic
sites, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and leukocyte count were each found to be associated with overall
survival (P <.05), whereas the site of the primary tumor and the presence of lymph node metastases were not. All 5 variables were
included in the nomogram. When subjected to internal validation, the nomogram achieved a bootstrap-corrected concordance index
of 0.626. When applied to the external validation cohort, the nomogram achieved a concordance index of 0.634. Calibration plots
suggested that the nomogram was well calibrated for all predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on routinely measured pretreatment variables, a nomogram was constructed that predicts survival in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer who are
treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This model may be useful in patient counseling and clinical trial design. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Contemporary cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens achieve objective responses in approximately
50&percnt to 60% of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.1,2 Although response durations are generally short, and
the median overall survival of patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer is only approximately 14
months, significant heterogeneity exists with regard to patient outcomes.2 Long-term follow-up of clinical trials has demonstrated that approximately 10% to 20% of patients are alive at 5 years.1,3 The ability to predict individual patient outcomes has clear implications with regard to both patient counseling and patient stratification on clinical trials.
Prognostic models have previously been developed for chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer. In 1998, Bajorin et al identified Karnofsky performance status and the presence of visceral metastases as independent predictors of survival in a cohort of patients treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, and doxorubicin
plus cisplatin (MVAC).4 Similar prognostic factors have been identified in cohorts of patients treated with other cisplatinbased regimens.5-7 However, there are some potential limitations to existing prognostic models in this clinical disease
state: 1) their performance (discrimination and calibration) has generally not been rigorously assessed and/or they have

not been validated externally; 2) they have not been
expanded on; and 3) they generally assign equal weight to
each prognostic variable, and “lump” patients into risk
categories, which may not be optimal for individualized
predictions.
Points-based nomograms for individualized risk prediction have been developed across a variety of clinical disease states in patients with genitourinary cancers and
other solid tumors. These nomograms differ from traditional prognostic models in several ways.8 Variable selection is generally performed before model development,
and is based on parameters that are believed to be clinically relevant, instead of relying on variables that retain
significance on multivariable analysis. The latter approach
may be suboptimal for maximizing predictive accuracy
because this leads to predictor variable coefficients that are
biased in high absolute value and confidence intervals
(CIs) that are falsely narrow. In addition, rather than
potentially forcing heterogeneity by placing patients into
defined risk groups, nomograms allow for differential
weights to be assigned to each variable, facilitating individualized risk estimates. Herein, we describe the development and internal and external validation of a point-based
nomogram for predicting survival in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer who were
treated with first-line, cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria

The development cohort included 399 patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were
enrolled on 7 phase 2 and phase 3 trials exploring firstline cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy from
1998 through 2011. The validation cohort included
patients enrolled on a phase 3 study comparing MVAC
with docetaxel plus cisplatin in patients with unresectable
and/or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (patients enrolled
from 1997-2002). The details of each trial are provided in
Table 1 and have been presented or published previously.9-16 Each study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the participating institutions and
informed consent was obtained before treatment.
Each protocol required a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Patients were required to
have unresectable (cT4b) and/or metastatic disease. The
pretreatment evaluations were similar among the protocols and included a complete history and physical examination and laboratory testing including a complete blood

cell and platelet count, renal function, and hepatic function. Imaging studies were performed at baseline and every 6 to 12 weeks during treatment, depending on the
study. Response assessments were performed using either
World Health Organization criteria17 or the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors18 and toxicity assessments were performed using either World Health Organization criteria or the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria.
Nomogram Development and Construction

A list of variables that are routinely measured before the
initiation of therapy was generated for nomogram development based on published reports and the authors’ experience. The variables analyzed included site of the primary
tumor (bladder vs other), number of distinct visceral metastatic sites, presence of lymph node metastases, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS), and leukocyte count. Lung, liver, and bone
metastases were considered visceral metastases, and the
number of visceral metastatic sites was based on the number of these organs involved (0-3). As noted in the introduction, for nomogram development, covariates that are
anticipated to have an impact on outcomes were defined
for inclusion a priori, rather than relying only on variables
that retain independent statistical significance on multivariable analysis.
Nomogram construction was performed as previously described.8 Briefly, this method consists of specifying the predictor variables of interest and the form of the
model to be used. In the current analysis, a multivariable
Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the
probability of overall survival at 1 year, 2 years, and 5
years for the site of the primary tumor, number of visceral
metastatic sites, presence of lymph node metastases,
ECOG PS, and leukocyte count. Next, the proportionality assumption of the Cox model was assessed by including time-varying covariates (an interaction between each
predictor and the event time) in the Cox proportional
hazards model. Because none of the interaction terms was
statistically significant, the proportionality assumption
was deemed valid. Finally, the nomogram itself was constructed based on the Cox model parameter estimates.
This process begins by assigning 100 points to the prognostic variable in the model with the largest parameter
estimate (in absolute value). Then the variable with the
next largest parameter (absolute value) is identified; the
number of points for this variable is calculated as the percentage obtained when dividing this second variable’s parameter estimate by the initial variable’s parameter

estimate. This process continues for all variables in the
model, with the points decreasing for each subsequent
variable. The predicted probabilities based on the Cox
model can be calculated for each combination of covariate
values; similarly, the total points can be calculated for
each combination of covariate values. Finally, the nomogram plots the range of predicted probabilities aligned so
that they correspond to the observed number of total
points for each observed combination of covariate values
in the data set.
Nomogram Validation

Nomogram validation included 3 activities: 1) internal
bootstrap validation, in which the Harrell concordance
index19 was estimated by bootstrapping with 200 resamples to calculate an unbiased measure of the ability of the
nomogram to discriminate among patients; 2) calibration,
which was constructed to examine how well the modelbased predicted probabilities of survival agreed with the
observed probabilities (in this calculation, 200 bootstrap
resamples were used to generate the 95% CIs for the
plot8); and 3) external validation, for which a Harrell cindex was calculated to assess the external validity of the
nomogram by comparing the nomogram-predicted probabilities based on the development cohort with observed
probabilities in the validation cohort.
The Design, Hmisc, and survival libraries in R Version 2.12.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria) were used to estimate the Cox model, as well as to
produce and validate the final nomogram.

vival (P < .05), whereas the site of the primary tumor and
the presence of lymph node metastases were not found to
demonstrate such an association (Table 3).
Prognostic Nomogram

The final nomogram including all 5 variables is illustrated
in Figure 1. With this nomogram, an individual patient’s
value for each variable is scored by locating the corresponding position on the variable scale and drawing a vertical line to determine the corresponding points. The total
points are then tallied, and a vertical line drawn through
the survival scales provides estimates for 1-year, 2-year, 5year, and median survival. For example, a patient with a
bladder primary tumor with lymph node metastases, an
ECOG PS of 0, no visceral metastases, and a normal
leukocyte count has a 1-year survival probability of
approximately 74%, a 5-year survival probability of
approximately 37%, and a median survival of approximately 26 months. Conversely, a patient with an upper
tract primary tumor, 3 distinct sites of visceral metastases,
elevated leukocyte counts, and an ECOG PS of 2 has a
1-year survival probability of < 5% and a median survival
of approximately 5 months.
Internal Validation

When subjected to internal validation, the nomogram
achieved an uncorrected concordance index of 0.639 and
a bootstrap-corrected concordance index of 0.626. Internal calibration showed that the predictions reasonably
approximated actual survival probabilities (Fig. 2).
Impact of Treatment Regimen

RESULTS
Among the 399 patients in the development set, 15 were
excluded based on missing dates for the start of treatment
or follow-up, leaving 384 patients for the final analysis.
No patients in the validation cohort were excluded
(n 5 186). The baseline patient characteristics are detailed
in Table 2. The median survival for the development
cohort was 13.8 months (95% CI, 12.1 months-16.0
months); 68.2% of patients had died at the time of last
follow-up. The median survival for the validation cohort
was 10.6 months (95% CI, 9.4 months-12.8months); at
the time of last follow-up, 94.1% of patients had died.

Because 2 trials including 5-fluorouracil-based regimens
were included in the development set, and such regimens
are not as commonly administered in general practice,
model discrimination was also assessed after excluding
these trials. The remaining data set was comprised of 5 trials exploring the use of gemcitabine plus cisplatin-based
or MVAC-based regimens. Notably, the treatment regimen used was not found to be a significant predictor of
survival on multivariable analysis (P 5 .15). Internal validation of the resulting data set from the 5 trials achieved a
bootstrap-corrected c-index of 0.631, which is very similar
to the discrimination achieved when model development
included the 5-fluorouracil-based trials.

Cox Proportional Hazards Model

External Validation

The results of the Cox proportional hazards model for the
development cohort demonstrated that the number of visceral metastatic sites, ECOG PS, and leukocyte counts
above normal limits each were associated with overall sur-

External validation was accomplished by comparing the
nomogram predictions for each patient in the validation
data set with the actual outcome. In this analysis, the
nomogram had an estimated concordance index of 0.634.

DISCUSSION
Patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial
cancer who were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy appear to experience heterogeneous clinical outcomes.
The ability to reliably predict outcomes before the initiation of treatment may enhance patient-physician communication, shared decision-making, and clinical trial
design. In an attempt to address these needs, we have
developed a points-based nomogram, with data derived
from an international cohort, to predict survival in
patients with urothelial cancer treated with first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy using pretreatment variables
measured on a routine basis.
Nomogram development began with the selection
of variables and included both variables previously associated with outcomes in this clinical disease state and other
variables believed to be potentially relevant based on our
experience and that of others. The final model consisted
of number of visceral metastatic sites, ECOG PS, presence
of lymph node metastases, site of the primary tumor, and
leukocyte count. It is important to note that for all the var3016

iables, the direction of the predictive effect was consistent
with what one would expect clinically. Performance status
and sites of metastases have been identified as prognostic
factors in several prior studies.4,5,7 Patients with metastatic urothelial cancers originating in the upper urinary
tract have been previously demonstrated to have inferior
outcomes and such tumors may have a different biology
than cancers originating in the bladder, despite sharing
the same histology.20-23 Although the site of the primary
tumor did not reach independent prognostic significance
on multivariable analysis, this may have been due to an
insufficient sample size and the primary tumor site was
still included in the final model as per standard nomogram development methodology. We previously identified leukocytosis as a significant predictor of survival in
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer in a preliminary
analysis.24 Notably, tumor-associated leukocytosis, generally neutrophilia, has been associated with poor outcomes
in patients with other solid tumors, and has been associated
with elevated serum levels of cytokines such as granulocytecolony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-6.25-27 However, to
our knowledge, this has not been previously demonstrated
and validated in patients with advanced urothelial cancer.
The etiology of tumor-associated leukocytosis in patients
with urothelial cancer, and its contribution to poor outcomes, warrants further evaluation.
The concordance index for the prognostic model
was 0.639 for the development cohort and 0.634 for the
validation cohort, suggesting moderate discrimination.
This nomogram should be considered a z “starting
point.” However, this finding should also be viewed
within the context of the limited available validated
options for individualized risk estimates in patients with
metastatic urothelial cancer. Furthermore, the discriminatory power of the current nomogram is within the
range of other tools commonly used for routine counseling and decision-making in clinical oncology.28,29
Refinement of the nomogram, with the identification of
additional clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and molecular predictors may, nonetheless, optimize the value of
this tool.
There are characteristics of the development and validation cohorts that both potentially increase and decrease
the generalizability of this tool. Data were derived from
patients from multiple different countries, enrolled on a
series of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, and treated
with a variety of different cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy regimens. However, patients also met rigorous clinical trial eligibility criteria and the majority of

trials required an ECOG PS of 1 or 2. Although patients
with an ECOG PS of >2 are less frequently treated with
cisplatin-based therapy, even outside of the context of
clinical trials, the cohort used to generate the model may
not be representative of the general population of patients
with metastatic urothelial cancer with respect to comor-

bidities. It is important to note that the eligibility criteria
used by the included trials were similar, but not identical.
There are other potential limitations to the current
study. Two 5-fluorouracil-based regimens were included
in the development cohort, which are not commonly
used in general practice. However, excluding these 2 trials appeared to have no meaningful impact on the model’s predictive ability, and the treatment regimen used
was not found to be significantly predictive of survival
on multivariable analysis. The validation cohort
included 2 regimens, one of which resulted in inferior
survival in the original randomized trial.15 Nevertheless,
the nomogram performed similarly in the validation
cohort compared with the development cohort. The
degree to which the differences in treatment regimens
may have contributed to the moderate discrimination
achieved with the current nomogram is not entirely
clear. However, practice pattern data suggest that
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer receive a variety of different first-line, cisplatin-based regimens,30 and
the goal of the current study was to include a diverse

points. Repeat this process for each of the remaining axes, drawing a straight line each time to the points axis. Sum the points
received for each predictive variable and locate this number on the total points axis. Draw a straight line down from the total
points to the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and median survival axes to determine the patient’s predicted survival probabilities. ECOG PS

therapy. Therefore, the intended use of the tool is for
counseling and clinical trial stratification for patients
receiving first-line, cisplatin-based chemotherapy and
may not apply to the population of cisplatin-ineligible
patients or those patients not fit to receive chemotherapy
at all.32
The current points-based prognostic nomogram,
which was validated both internally and externally,
may be used to predict outcomes in patients with
metastatic urothelial cancer who are treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The identification of
novel prognostic variables may further enhance the
performance of the nomogram. In addition, studies
to define the role of such tools in patient counseling
are needed.

range of treatments in an effort to increase the generalizability of the tool. Many of the trials excluded patients
who previously were treated with perioperative chemotherapy, whereas others only included patients if such
therapy was completed > 1 year before study enrollment.
Whether patients who developed disease recurrence after
having received perioperative chemotherapy should still
be considered “first-line” remains controversial because
such patients are rarely retreated with cisplatin-based
regimens in standard clinical practice and are often
included in “second-line” clinical trials. Furthermore,
the small percentage of patients previously treated with
perioperative chemotherapy included in the current
study is in keeping with estimates of perioperative chemotherapy in population-based studies.31 The validation
set in the current study was not selected at random, but
was selected based on the finding that it was the largest
single available trial for which we had data access that
approximated the size of the development cohort.
Finally, the nomogram was developed from a cohort of
patients who were treated with cisplatin-based chemo3018
