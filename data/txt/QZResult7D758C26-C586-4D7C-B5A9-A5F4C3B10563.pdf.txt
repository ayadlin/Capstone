BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of simvastatin in combination with irinotecan and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC).
METHODS: In this phase 2 study, 61 patients received treatment with irinotecan (65 mg/m2) and cisplatin (30 mg/
m2) on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks until either death or disease progression occurred. Patients also received oral simvastatin (40 mg daily) during the course of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was 1-year survival. Secondary endpoints included the response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. RESULTS: The 1-year survival
rate was 39.3%. The median overall survival (OS) was 11 months, and the median PFS was 6.1 months. Overall, the RR
was 75%. The most common grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (67%). Efficacy of the treatment was associated significantly with smoking status. Compared with never-smokers, ever-smokers had a better RR (40% vs 78%; P ¼ .01), a
longer PFS (2.5 months vs 6.4 months; P ¼ .018), and had a trend toward an improved OS (9.0 months vs 11.2 months;
P ¼ .095). The effect of smoking on survival was apparent when ever-smokers were subdivided according to packyears (PY) of smoking. Ever-smokers who had smoked >65 PY had a significantly longer OS compared with eversmokers who had smoked 65 PY or never-smokers (20.6 months vs 10.6 months vs 9.0 months, respectively; logrank P ¼ 0.032). In multivariate analysis, PY >65 was predictive of longer survival (hazard ratio, 0.280; 95% confidence interval, 0.113-0.694). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that simvastatin in combination with irinotecan and cisplatin did not improve the survival of patients with ED-SCLC. Although the subgroup analysis by
smoking status was exploratory, the addition of simvastatin to irinotecan and cisplatin may improve the outcome of

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) now accounts for 15% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases, and 60% to 70% of

patients present with extensive disease (ED).1 Despite a high initial response rate to chemotherapy, most patients die from
rapid recurrence. From the time of diagnosis, the median range of survival for patients with ED-SCLC is 8 months to 10
months, and 5% to 10% of patients survive for 2 years.2
Over the past 2 decades, the standard treatment for ED-SCLC has been a platinum compound and etoposide combination (EP). In 2002, Japanese investigators demonstrated the superiority of the combination treatment of irinotecan and
cisplatin (IP) over EP in response rate (84.4% vs 67.5%), progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 6.9 months vs 4.8
months), and overall survival (OS). The median OS was 12.8 months in the IP arm versus 9.4 months in the EP arm. The
1-year and 2-year survival rates were 58.4% versus 37.7% and 19.5% versus 5.2%, respectively.3 However, 2 larger
randomized phase 3 studies in North American populations revealed no significant difference between IP and EP.4,5
Although IP chemotherapy may provide some advantages in the treatment of SCLC, significant research still is needed.
Statins are cholesterol-lowering agents that are used widely to reduce cardiovascular risk. In addition to their lipid-lowering effects, statins also may have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of cancer.6,7 It has been demonstrated that
statins exert several beneficial antitumor properties, including inhibition of tumor cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis.8 Several human observation studies have reported that statin use appeared to be

associated with a lower risk of developing cancer, especially
lung and colorectal cancers, than nonuse.9,10 In addition,
increasing evidence suggests that statins may enhance the
antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents. Synergistic
interactions have been reported between statins and cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin.11 A preclinical study
has demonstrated that simvastatin is a potent inhibitor of
SCLC growth in vitro and in vivo. It profoundly impairs
SCLC cell growth, induces apoptosis, and enhances sensitivity to etoposide.12 Recently, we also demonstrated a synergistic cytotoxicity between simvastatin and irinotecan in
human lung cancer cells.13 These antitumor properties, together with a high safety profile, have made statins more
attractive drugs for lung cancer. Given the promising preclinical antitumor effects of simvastatin in SCLC and the
synergistic interaction with irinotecan, a phase 2 study of
simvastatin and IP chemotherapy was initiated in patients
with untreated ED-SCLC.

1 and 8 on a 21-day cycles. Simvastatin (CJ Pharmaceutical
Company, Seoul, Korea) 40 mg daily was given orally during the course of IP chemotherapy. Study treatment continued until disease progression or until another termination
criterion was met, including unacceptable toxicity, consent
withdrawal, loss to follow-up, death, major protocol violation, or noncompliance. The protocol was approved by an
independent ethics committee/institutional review board
and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki according to good clinical practice.
Assessment
Response assessment was performed every 2 cycles according to RECIST criteria.14 Toxicity was graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured
at baseline and 6 weeks thereafter.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed
ED-SCLC were enrolled. Patients had measurable disease
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST).14 Other eligibility criteria included
no previous systemic chemotherapy, primary radiation, or
biologic treatment; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2;
adequate organ function (defined as white blood cell
count 4.0  109/L, platelet count 100  109/L, total
bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate transferase 2 times the
institutional upper limit of normal, and creatinine 1.5
mg/dL); and age 18 years. Patients with brain metastasis
were allowed unless they had clinically significant neurologic symptoms. Patients were excluded if they had a previous malignancy within 3 years, with the exception of
skin cancer (excluding melanoma), cervical carcinoma in
situ, in situ breast carcinoma, or early stage prostate cancer. Women who were pregnant or lactating also were
excluded. Patients with reproductive potential were
required to use barrier contraception during treatment.
All patients were required to provide written informed
consent before study entry.
Treatment
Treatment was given in an outpatient setting. All patients
received irinotecan 65 mg/m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 (irinotecan and cisplatin [IP]) by intravenous infusion on Days

Dose Modification
During the course of chemotherapy, irinotecan doses
were decreased by 10 mg/m2 for grade 4 hematologic toxicities or grade 3 or 4 diarrhea. Cisplatin doses were
decreased by 25% for patients with serum creatinine levels
of 1.6 to 2.1 mg/dL or grade 4 hematologic toxicities. Cisplatin doses were not adjusted for grade 2 or 3 diarrhea or
for hematologic toxicities. A dose reduction was maintained in the subsequent cycles. There was no dose modification plan for simvastatin.
Smoking History
Tobacco use history included age of regular smoking initiation, average cigarettes smoked per day, and total years
of smoking. These factors were assessed at the time of the
diagnosis based on the patient’s self-report. Smoking status was classified into 3 categories: never-smokers, former
smokers, and current smokers. Then, these 3 categories
were grouped into 2: ever-smokers (current and former
smokers) and never-smokers. Never-smokers were those
who had smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime and
were not current smokers. Former smokers had to have
quit at least 1 year before the study. Current smokers continued to smoke or quit less than 1 year before the study.
The total number of pack-years (PY) was calculated by
multiplying the number of packs smoked a day by the
number of years of regular cigarette smoking. No environmental tobacco smoke exposure data were collected.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was the 1-year survival
rate. The aim was to obtain a 1-year survival rate 45%
with this regimen, and a 1-year survival rate of 30% was
set as the lowest level of interest. A sample size of 55 eligible patients was calculated to be necessary with an a value
of 5% and a power of 80% using the minimax design of
Simon. Secondary endpoints included objective tumor
response rate, PFS, and treatment-related toxicity. PFS
was calculated from the date of registration on the study
to the date of documented disease progression or death.
Patients without documented progression or death
reported were censored at the time of the last documented
disease evaluation. OS was calculated from the date of
study registration to the date of death from any cause. If a
patient was lost to follow-up, then the patient was censored on the date of last contact. The survival analysis was
performed according to the intent-to-treat principle.
Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to estimate differences in event-time distributions and medians.
The Fisher exact test was used to test for associations
between categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios
(HR) in univariate and multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, the significance level for entering an effect
into a model was limited to 0.1. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Two-sided P values <.05 were considered significant.
RPART, a recursive partitioning procedure or tree
classification algorithm in R 2.2.1 (R Development Core
Team, Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org accessed November 15, 2010), was used to determine optimal cutoff points for smoking PY and age.15 The P value
for comparisons of serum lipid and lipoprotein levels with
respect to the mean change from the baseline to Week 6
after treatment was estimated with the Mann-Whitney
test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between April 2006 and April 2009, 61 patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics are described in Table 1.
The median age was 65 years (range, 44-77 years). Fiftysix patients (92%) were men, and 5 patients (8%) were
women. The ECOG PS was 0 in 4 patients (7%), 1 in 39
patients (64%), and 2 in 18 patients (29%). Five patients
(4 women and 1 man) were never-smokers. Current and
former smokers comprised 61% and 31% of patients,

respectively. The median PY in ever-smokers was 50 PY
(range, 20-120 PY). No patient had received statins before
study treatment. Baseline total cholesterol levels were
within normal range in all patients.
Delivery of Treatment
Of 61 patients enrolled, 59 patients received at least 1
cycle of treatment (median, 6 cycles; range, 1-12 cycles).
Two patients withdrew consent after receiving only Day 1
treatment of the first cycle. Thirty-two patients (52%)
completed at least 6 cycles of treatment. Thirty-one
patients required dose reductions according to the dosemodification rules described above. The median dose intensity (the actual dose delivered as a proportion of the
planned dose with or without delay) was 72.8% for irinotecan and 72.3% for cisplatin. All 61 patients were assessable for toxicity and survival.
Efficacy Results
Best responses are shown in Table 2. Of 61 patients enrolled, 56 were assessable for response. Of the remaining 5
patients who were not assessable for response, 2 patients
withdrew consent after receiving Day 1 of Cycle 1 chemotherapy, and the other 3 patients received only 1 cycle of
chemotherapy because of treatment-related toxicity (n ¼

2) or consent withdrawal (n ¼ 1). Among the 56 assessable patients, 42 patients had a partial response, and the
overall response rate (ORR) was 75%. Ten patients
(18%) had stable disease, and 4 patients (7%) had progressive disease.
The cutoff for the OS update was May 27, 2010. At
a median follow-up of 33.6 months (range, 12.9-48.8
months), 8 of 61 patients were alive. The median PFS was
6.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-7.5
months), and the 6-month and 1-year PFS rates were
52.8% (95% CI, 40.1%-65.5%) and 10.2% (95% CI,
2.4%-18.0%), respectively. The median OS was 11.0
months (95% CI, 9.9-12.1 months), and the 1-year and
2-year survival rates were 39.3% (95% CI, 27.0%51.6%) and 10.9% (95% CI, 1.9%-19.9%), respectively.
When comparing efficacy according to smoking
status, significant differences in ORR and PFS were
observed. Ever-smokers had a higher response rate compared with never-smokers (78% vs 40%; P ¼ .010). Likewise, ever-smokers had a longer median PFS than neversmokers (6.4 months vs 2.5 months; log-rank P ¼ .018).
Ever-smokers also had a trend toward improved OS compared with never-smokers (median, 11.2 months vs 9.0
months; log-rank P ¼ .095). The effect of smoking on
survival was apparent when we subdivided ever-smokers
according to smoking amount. Ever-smokers who
smoked >65 PY had a significantly longer survival compared with those who smoked 65 PY or never-smokers

(median PFS: 8.3 months vs 6.3 months vs 2.5 months,
respectively; log-rank P ¼ .036; median OS: 20.6 months
vs 10.6 months vs 9.0 months, respectively; log-rank P ¼
.032). In multivariate analysis, PY and number of metastatic sites were predictive for OS (Table 3). Figures 1 and
2 show the differences in PFS and OS by smoking status
and PY.
Serum Lipid and Lipoprotein Levels
Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels at baseline and at 6
weeks after treatment as well as mean changes in the levels
from baseline to Week 6 are summarized in Table 4.
Patients who smoked >65 PY had higher baseline total
cholesterol compared with those who smoked 65 PY or
never-smokers. They also had a trend toward a higher
change in total cholesterol after 6 weeks of treatment.
Toxicity
All patients who received at least 1 dose of therapy were
assessable for toxicity. Toxicity was reported as the maximum toxicity experienced during study treatment. The
most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity, as shown in Table 5,
was myelosuppression, including neutropenia (67%) and
anemia (23%). Eight patients (13%) developed febrile
neutropenia. Two patients died because of sepsis in the
setting of neutropenia after the first and sixth cycles of
chemotherapy, respectively. Grade 3 diarrhea developed
in 9 patients (15%).

DISCUSSION
This phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of
simvastatin in combination with IP in patients with EDSCLC. The primary endpoint was 1-year survival. Our
choice of IP as the chemotherapy template was based on a

series of phase 2 studies in our center and a larger randomized phase 3 dataset from Japan. Compared with historic
outcomes for first-line treatment of ED-SCLC with IP
alone, the addition of simvastatin did not improve survival. In an unplanned subgroup analysis by smoking

status, ever-smokers had a higher response rate and longer
PFS compared with never-smokers. The effect on survival
was more apparent when we subdivided ever-smokers
according to the amount of cigarette smoking history as
measured by PY. Patients who smoked >65 PY had significantly longer PFS and OS compared with those who
smoked 65 PY or never-smokers. Although this
unplanned subgroup analysis was only exploratory, it suggested that the addition of simvastatin to IP chemotherapy may improve the outcome of heavy smokers with EDSCLC.
Chronic inflammatory conditions caused by smoking are believed to play a role in the initiation and promotion of lung cancer.16 Among the 4 major lung cancer
histologies, SCLC has been highly associated with smoking. A recent meta-analysis evaluating the effects of cigarette smoking on the histologic subtypes of lung cancer
demonstrated the strongest association with SCLC. The
highest odds ratio, 72.5, was observed in current smokers

Cancer

with SCLC.17 Moreover, smoking is related to increased
metastasis and confers resistance to apoptosis.18 In addition to lung cancer development and progression, smoking-related comorbidity may be 1 of the important
determinants of survival. According to the US Surgeon
General, smoking accounts for 82% of deaths from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 21% of
deaths from coronary heart disease, and 18% of deaths
from stroke.19 Thus, patients with lung cancer and a history of heavy smoking are at a higher risk of death from a
spectrum of smoking-related diseases and usually have a
poor prognosis.20,21 However, our current study demonstrated that simvastatin in combination with IP chemotherapy improved survival in heavy smokers with SCLC.
It has been demonstrated that statins decrease the incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation.8 Statins also possess significant anti-inflammatory
properties, which may have beneficial effects on comorbidities associated with COPD.22 The benefits of statins
are not limited to patients with hypercholesterolemia.
Several randomized studies have indicated that, even in
patients who have normal total and LDL cholesterol levels, statin administration is associated with less cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.8 Furthermore, a
retrospective study of 282 patients with diagnosed SCLC
demonstrated slightly prolonged median survival among
statin users, whereas the median survival in nonstatin
users was not statistically significant (8.66 months vs 7.37
months; P ¼ .29). With the trend of an increase in median survival, the authors of that report concluded that
the continuation of statins for comorbidity management,

2183

Original Article

whenever possible, still may benefit patients with SCLC
while they were receiving standard antitumor therapies.23
These findings suggest that simvastatin may decrease
smoking-related comorbidities, which may explain the
survival improvement in heavy smokers with SCLC.
Inhibition of intracellular cholesterol production
may be 1 mechanism by which statins prevent cancer development. Elevated cholesterol increases the expression
of caveolin-1, which regulates the phosphorylation of Akt,
an important step in intracellular signaling and cell survival. Furthermore, overexpression of caveolin-1 has been
associated with metastasis in some studies of lung and colon cancer.10 In our current study, heavy smokers had
higher baseline total cholesterol levels compared with
others. They also had a trend toward a higher change in
total cholesterol levels after 6 weeks of simvastatin treatment. This finding supports the beneficial effect of simvastatin in heavy smokers. Moreover, simvastatin may have
additional antitumor effects that depend on its lipophilic
characteristic.10 Several laboratory studies have demonstrated that lipophilic statins like simvastatin may promote cell cycle arrest by inhibiting proteasome through
their lactone moieties.24,25 Previously, we conducted a series of preclinical studies of simvastatin in combination
with irinotecan in human lung cancer cell lines. We
observed that simvastatin in combination with irinotecan
had a synergistic cytotoxicity. Simvastatin enhanced irinotecan-related apoptosis. In addition, simvastatin had
superior proteasome inhibition activity, leading to the
effective suppression of nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) activation.13 It also has been demonstrated that tobacco components stimulate Akt-dependent proliferation and NF-jBdependent survival of lung cancer cells, which may confer
resistance to chemotherapy.26-28 High nuclear expression
of NF-jB is observed frequently in lung cancer tissues,
and significantly higher levels are observed in SCLC tissues compared with NSCLC tissues.29 Therefore, the proteasome-inhibitory activity of simvastatin may effectively
suppress NF-jB activation in heavy smokers, which may
have improved their outcome in our study.
Because of the strong association between smoking
and SCLC, the number of never-smokers in this study
was small. Despite this limitation, the survival advantage
with this combination in heavy smokers with SCLC seems
important, because an OS benefit was not reported consistently in other studies that incorporated novel agents with
chemotherapy in patients with SCLC. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to report an inverse association
between PY and survival in SCLC. Although cross-study

2184

comparisons are difficult to make, our data suggest that
the addition of simvastatin to IP may improve survival in
heavy smokers with SCLC relative to IP chemotherapy
alone. Further randomized studies will be essential to
explore the possibility that simvastatin treatment
improves the outcome of heavy smokers with ED-SCLC.
