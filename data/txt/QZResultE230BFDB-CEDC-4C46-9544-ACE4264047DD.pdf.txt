ABSTRACT
The combination of pemetrexed and sorafenib has significant clinical activity
against a wide variety of tumor types in patients and the present studies were
performed to determine whether sildenafil enhances the killing potential of
[pemetrexed + sorafenib]. In multiple genetically diverse lung cancer cell lines,
sildenafil enhanced the lethality of [pemetrexed + sorafenib]. The three-drug
combination reduced the activities of AKT, mTOR and STAT transcription factors;
increased the activities of eIF2α and ULK-1; lowered the expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL,
thioredoxin and SOD2; and increased the expression of Beclin1. Enhanced cell killing
by sildenafil was blocked by inhibition of death receptor signaling and autophagosome
formation. Enforced activation of STAT3 and AKT or inhibition of JNK significantly
reduced cell killing. The enhanced cell killing caused by sildenafil was more reliant
on increased PKG signaling than on the generation of nitric oxide. In vivo sildenafil
enhanced the anti-tumor properties of [pemetrexed + sorafenib]. Based on our
data we argue that additional clinical studies combining pemetrexed, sorafenib and
sildenafil are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

The changes in chaperone ATPase activity and
chaperone conformation after [sorafenib + pemetrexed],
[regorafenib + sildenafil], [sorafenib + sildenafil] and
[pazopanib + sildenafil] exposure were also reflected in
the phosphorylation/activity of key chaperoned proteins
[1, 2, 5–10]. The drugs interacted with sildenafil to
inactivate the chaperone GRP78 that was associated
with a large increase in PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum
(PERK) auto-phosphorylation and with subsequent
enhanced down-stream eIF2α phosphorylation [2, 5–10].
The increased expression of the essential autophagosome
forming proteins Beclin1 and LC3, caused by the drug
combinations, required eIF2α signaling. In addition
to GRP78, the drugs interacted with sildenafil to also
inactivate the chaperones HSP90 and HSP70 which in
turn lost their ability to associate with another chaperone
HSP27. Reduced HSP27-HSP90/HSP70 association
resulted in altered HSP27 oligomerization and localization
without any obviously changes in HSP27 phosphorylation
[1, 2]. More importantly, combined loss of GRP78 and
HSP27 function reduced signaling through the cytoprotective PI3 kinase pathway, causing a greater level
of mTOR inactivation than that of AKT [2]. Reduced
mTOR activity resulted in ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation
declining and the phosphorylation of the ULK-1 substrate,

Sorafenib, in addition to being an inhibitor of
protein ser/thr/tyr kinases was also recently discovered
to be a potent inhibitor of chaperone ATPase activities
that are associated with conformational changes in the
ATP binding NH2-termini of the chaperone proteins
and with the abilities of these chaperones to associate
and co-localize with other chaperones as well as client
proteins [1, 2]. It has been reported by others that cGMP/
PKG phosphorylation of chaperones inactivates their
ATPase activities [3, 4]. We recently determined that
that PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra®) did not
significantly alter basal chaperone ATPase activities but
instead facilitated the drugs sorafenib, regorafenib and
pazopanib to cause further inhibition of chaperone ATPase
activities and a more rapid NH2-terminus conformational
change which was reliant on PKG activation [1, 2, 5–9].
In addition, the thymidylate synthase inhibitor pemetrexed
enhanced the ability of sorafenib to reduce GRP78
chaperone activity and increase eIF2α phosphorylation [2].
In the recently published companion paper to this
manuscript we demonstrated that pemetrexed could also
reduce chaperone activity, that required basal levels of
PKG phosphorylation [10].

RESULTS

ATG13 S318, becoming elevated [2, 9]. ATG13 is the
gate-keeper for the formation of autophagosomes, with its
phosphorylation promoting protein complex formation.
Pemetrexed also enhanced ULK-1 S317 phosphorylation,
via AMP-dependent kinase signaling, which is also
associated with ULK-1 kinase activation [2, 10]. In
general agreement with the role of Beclin1, LC3 and
ATG13 in the control of autophagosome formation and
maturation it was noted that phospho-ATG13 S318 was
localized in autophagosomes with Beclin1 and LC3
[2, 10]. Knock down of ATG13 or Beclin1 prevented
autophagosome formation and drug combination lethality
[2, 10]. Over-expression of GRP78 and HSP27 prevented
PERK activation and mTOR inactivation resulting in less
autophagosome formation and cell killing [1, 2, 10].
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors) are
widely used to treat erectile dysfunction [11]. PDE5 is
expressed in the wider vasculature and myocardium [11].
Tumor cells can over-express PDE5, as we have
demonstrated in hepatoma, breast and NSCLC [7, 9].
PDE5 inhibitors have a well-established safety record
and have been shown to be safe in combination with most
other medications [12, 13]. The vast majority of studies
examining the molecular biology of PDE5 inhibitors
have been performed in vascular smooth muscle cells,
monocytes and cardiac tissue; not in tumor cells. PDE5
catalyzes the degradation of cyclic GMP (cGMP); i.e. thus
PDE5 inhibitors increase cGMP levels [reviewed in 14].
The second messenger nitric oxide (NO) induces smooth
muscle relaxation via the actions of cGMP [15–18]. NO at
nanomolar levels binds tightly to a heme group in
NO-guanylyl cyclase (GC), also known as soluble
guanylyl cyclase, and causes a ~150-fold activation of
the enzyme. Activation of NO-GC elevates cGMP levels,
which initiate the cGMP signaling pathway, in part
through activation of cGMP dependent protein kinase
(PKG) [19, 20]. It is known in non-tumor cells that cGMP/
PKG, through its stimulatory actions upon the ERK1/2,
p38 MAPK, JNK1/2 and NFκB pathways can increase
the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
[21–23]. Thus increased levels of NO activate GC and
increase cGMP levels, that activates signaling pathways
which increase iNOS levels; and, increased iNOS levels
lead to further increases in cellular NO. One mechanism
by which NO is inactivated is by its reaction with the
superoxide anion (O2−) [24, 25]. Compared to nontransformed cells, tumor cells generate greater amounts
of O2−. The reaction of NO with O2- forms the more potent
oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO-) that can damage the
functionality of proteins, lipids and DNA [26–30].
The present studies were designed to build upon
our work with [pemetrexed + sildenafil], [sorafenib +
sildenafil] and [sorafenib + pemetrexed] and were to
determine whether PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil
(Viagra®) enhance the anti-tumor effects of [pemetrexed +
sorafenib] in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Prior studies have demonstrated using clinically
relevant drug concentrations that the NSCLC therapeutic
pemetrexed and the liver/renal carcinoma therapeutic
sorafenib synergize to killing tumor cells via the induction
of toxic autophagosomes [34]. Pemetrexed both causes
DNA damage through inhibition of thymidylate synthase
and promotes autophagy via ZMP-induced activation of
the AMP-dependent protein kinase [31, 32]. Sorafenib, as
an inhibitor of chaperones and class III receptor tyrosine
kinases, reduces the activity of mTOR and STAT3, and
causes endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling that both
promotes expression of autophagy regulatory proteins
such as Beclin1 and suppresses the expression of shorthalf-lived protective proteins such as MCL-1. Collectively
these double independent actions upon autophagy leads
to tumor cell death. The [pemetrexed + sorafenib] drug
combination has proved particularly effective in solid
tumor patients with a 61% response rate noted [35]. More
recently, through PKG-dependent and NO-dependent
mechanisms, sildenafil was independently shown to
enhance pemetrexed toxicity and sorafenib toxicity [7, 10].
Thus, our initial studies determined in a genetically
diverse set of NSCLC cells whether the phosphodiesterase
5 inhibitor sildenafil interacted with the combination
of the lung and liver cancer therapeutics [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib], to enhance tumor cell killing. In vitro
drug concentrations in the present manuscript were
chosen based on the reported C max values of the
drugs in patients; cells are treated with drugs in the 1%
(pemetrexed) – 20% (sorafenib) - 100% (sildenafil) range
of that safely found in patient plasma. To varying degrees,
sildenafil enhanced the killing potential of [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib] in lung cancer cells (Figure 1A). The three
drug combination was equally effective at killing in wild
type and in vivo generated afatinib resistant H1975 cells
(Figure 1B). The colon cancer therapeutic regorafenib as a
single agent was less effective than sorafenib at enhancing
pemetrexed lethality, whereas pemetrexed combined
with both regorafenib and sildenafil caused high levels
of tumor cell death (Figure 1C). The older thymidylate
synthase inhibitor drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU), that unlike
pemetrexed has not proposed to elevate ZMP levels, also
combined with regorafenib and sildenafil to kill NSCLC
cells (Figure 1D).
Afatinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cells were
generated as part of the project that demonstrated
ERBB1/2/4 inhibitors enhanced [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
killing [2]. The resistant H1975 cells did not contain any
additional hot spot mutations when compared to wild type
cells but exhibited high levels of SRC-dependent ERBB3
phosphorylation and increased expression of c-MET
and c-KIT [2, 37]. Treatment of wild type and afatinib
resistant H1975 cells with [pemetrexed + sorafenib +
sildenafil] reduced the expression of the mitochondrial

protective proteins MCL-1 and BCL-XL and the reactive
oxygen species detoxifying protein thioredoxin (TRX)
(Figure  2A). The phosphorylation of ULK-1 S757,
STAT3, STAT5, mTOR and AKT was reduced and the
phosphorylation of eIF2α enhanced (Figure 2A and 2B).
Six hours after drug combination exposure, in agreement
with ULK-1 S757 dephosphorylation, the phosphorylation
of ATG13 S318 was elevated, prior to any observed actual
cell killing; in cells treated with the three drug combination
the levels of phospho-ATG13 S318 were marginally
higher than those in cells only treated with pemetrexed
and sorafenib (Figure 2C). Of greater note was that 12 h
after drug exposure, at a time when three drug treated
cells were undergoing cell death, the levels of phosphoATG13 S318 had declined. In A549 and H460 cells
three-drug treatment, as well as two-drug pemetrexed and

sorafenib treatment of lung cancer cells also increased the
phosphorylation of eIF2α S51, indicative of endoplasmic
reticulum stress, and ATG13 S318 whereas it decreased
the phosphorylation of AKT T308, p70 S6K T389, mTOR
S2448 and ULK-1 S757 (Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure 1). These drug-induced changes in phosphorylation
were associated with reduced expression of the protective
BCL-XL and MCL-1 proteins, and increased expression of
the autophagy regulatory protein Beclin1.
As eIF2α was phosphorylated after drug combination
exposure, we next determined the relative importance of the
known endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways
in the death and/or survival of tumor cells treated with
[pemetrexed + sorafenib]. In H460 cells over-expression
of BCL-XL, the caspase 8/10 inhibitor c-FLIP-s, [HSP70
+ HSP90] or GRP78 significantly reduced the lethality

with [pemetrexed + regorafenib + sildenafil] is shown; all data are statistically significantly greater than the killing caused by [pemetrexed

of [pemetrexed + sorafenib + sildenafil] treatment
(Figure 3C). Knock down of the death receptor CD95, the
death receptor docking protein FADD, Beclin1, ATG5, the
necroptotic DNA digesting enzyme AIF or eIF2α reduced
the lethality of [pemetrexed + sildenafil] and [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib + sildenafil] whereas knock down of XBP-1,
part of the IRE1 endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling
pathway, enhanced killing. Very similar cell viability
data were obtained in H460 and A549 NSCLC cells
(Supplementary Figures 3, 4 and 5).
Prior studies had created a series of HCT116 colon
cancer cell clones that expressed K-RAD D13 (wild type
parental) as well as HCT116 clones that were deleted for

K-RAS D13 and instead expressed H-RAS V12; H-RAS
V12-35 that specifically activates ERK1/2; H-RAS V12
that specifically activates PI3K [38, 39]. Deletion of
K-RAS D13, termed C2 cells, significantly enhanced the
lethality of [pemetrexed + sorafenib] but not of the three
drug combination (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of
H-RAS V12 significantly reduced the lethality of both the
two and three drug combinations. Expression of H-RAS
V12-35 did not protect cells from either of the drug
combinations with killing similar to that in the C2 cells
that lack expression of any mutated active RAS protein.
Expression of H-RAS V12-40 maintained cell sensitivity
to the two drug combinations at a level comparable to that

observed in the wild type HCT116 cells expressing K-RAS
D13. In A549 cells that express a mutated active K-RAS
expression of activated forms of AKT, MEK1, mTOR or
STAT3 variably reduced drug-induced killing by 50–70%,
as did inhibition of the JNK pathway (Figure 4B).
Similar data were observed in H460 cells over-expressing
activated AKT and STAT3 (Figure 4C). In wild type and
afatinib H1975 cells that express a double mutated active
ERBB1 expression of activated forms of AKT, MEK1,
mTOR, p70 S6K or STAT3 reduced drug-induced killing
by > 75% (Supplementary Figure 6). Knock down of the
IRE1-XBP-1 pathway enhanced killing by [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib + sildenafil] (Figure 5A). Over-expression
of multiple chaperone proteins could circumvent the
enhanced tumor cell killing by IRE1-XBP-1 pathway
knock down (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 7).
The roles of cGMP and nitric oxide in the regulation of
pemetrexed toxicity were next investigated. Knock down of
PKGI and PKGII expression together significantly reduced
the ability of sildenafil to enhance [pemetrexed + sorafenib]
toxicity (Figure 5B). Pan-inhibition of nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) enzymes using the chemical compound L-NAME

also significantly reduced the ability of sildenafil to enhance
pemetrexed lethality although this effect was significantly
less than that afforded by knock down of PKGI/II. We
then determined which NOS enzymes were responsible for
facilitating the sildenafil effect. We did not observe nNOS
expression in our cells (data not shown). In H1975 cells
knock down of eNOS and iNOS, but not either individually,
reduced [pemetrexed + sildenafil] lethality (Figure 5C and
Supplementary Figure 8). In H460 and A549 cells knock
down of either iNOS or eNOS reduced drug combination
lethality (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure 8).
Finally, we determined whether sildenafil interacted
with [pemetrexed + sorafenib] in vivo to suppress lung
tumor growth (Figure 6A). Treatment with [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib], but not sildenafil, reduced the growth of
H460 NSCLC tumors. However, the reduction in tumor
growth in animals treated with [pemetrexed + sildenafil +
sorafenib] was significantly greater than either individual
treatment. By Day 15, 12 days after the cessation of
therapy vehicle control treated tumors had increased their
volume 8.3-fold whereas those treated with [pemetrexed +
sildenafil + sorafenib] had increased their volume 2.4-fold.

with pemetrexed (1.0 µM), sildenafil (2.0 µM), sorafenib (2.0 µM), alone or in combination as indicated. Cells were fixed in place and

cytospun onto the 96 well plate and cell viability determined. The percentage cell death under each transfection and treatment condition was
calculated and values with a statistical significance lower than the corresponding value CMV cells are in red; those whose value is greater

cells). (C) H460 cells were transfected with an empty vector plasmid (CMV) or with plasmids to express: BCL-XL; c-FLIP-s; dominant

pemetrexed (1.0 µM), sildenafil (2.0 µM), sorafenib (2.0 µM), alone or in combination as indicated. Floating cells were then cytospun onto
the 96 well plate and cell viability determined. The percentage cell death under each transfection and treatment condition was calculated and

DISCUSSION

in facilitating a more robust increase in the numbers of
toxic autophagosomes and tumor cell killing. Based on our
prior studies in multiple tumor cell types using sildenafil
as an activity enhancer of established chemotherapies we
suggest that this agent may have a broad utility in future
chemotherapeutic approaches.
In this manuscript we also extended our analyses
from using sorafenib to its cousin, the more soluble
fluorinated and potent drug regorafenib. In comparison
to our prior studies combining [pemetrexed + sorafenib],
the combination of [pemetrexed + regorafenib] was much
less effective at killing tumor cells. We know that as a
single agent, when compared to sorafenib, regorafenib
is a much weaker inhibitor of the HSP90 and HSP70
chaperone ATPase activities [1]. Regorafenib as a single
agent, also, is less capable of causing an NH2-terminal

In the companion manuscript to the present
studies we demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors such as
sildenafil (Viagra®) and tadalafil (Cialis®) could enhance
the lethality of the NSCLC standard-of-care medication
pemetrexed (Alimta®) [10]. The studies in this manuscript
attempted to build upon these findings and determine
whether PDE5 inhibitors could enhance the killing
potential of the clinically relevant drug combination
of [pemetrexed + sorafenib] (see also NCT01450384;
NCT02624700; NCT02466802). In a manner similar
to our prior studies combining [sorafenib/regorafenib
+ sildenafil] and [pemetrexed + sorafenib + afatinib]
we found that the ability of sildenafil to increase the
levels of both cGMP and nitric oxide played key roles

conformational change in chaperone tertiary structure
when compared to sorafenib, however, when combined
with sildenafil regorafenib becomes competent to
inhibit chaperone ATPase activities and to cause the
NH2-terminal conformational change [1, 5]. In our
present studies we found that [regorafenib + sildenafil]
interacted with both pemetrexed and the first generation
thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5-fluorouracil to kill in a
greater than additive fashion. As a phase I trial combining
[pemetrexed + sorafenib] with positive results has
been completed (NCT01450384), and as a phase I trial
combining [regorafenib + sildenafil] is nearing completion
(NCT02466802), our present in vitro and animal studies
herein suggest that the combination of [regorafenib +
sildenafil + 5FU/pemetrexed] should be considered as a
phase I trial in all solid tumor patients [35].
The combination of [pemetrexed + sorafenib +
sildenafil] fully inactivated signaling by multiple cytoprotective proteins including the AKT/ERK pathways,
NFκB and STAT3/STAT5 (Figure 6B). These changes
in activity were associated with reduced protein levels
of the mitochondrial/ER protective proteins BCL-XL

and MCL-1, and of the reactive oxygen species detoxifying
enzymes thioredoxin and super-oxide dismutase. In
the companion manuscript we found that one major/
essential component of the killing process by [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil] was through increased death receptor
expression/death receptor activation (Figure  6B)  [10].
Our data with the three drug combination is however
more nuanced, with sildenafil in some cell types
enhancing [pemetrexed + sorafenib] lethality through
death receptor signaling whereas in other cell types the
three drug combination does not appear to heavily rely
on signaling by death receptors. In some of the tumor cell
types tested, the restoration of signaling through multiple
cyto-protective pathways, e.g. AKT and STAT3 in H460
cells, was required to significantly suppress killing by the
three drug combination whereas in H1975 cells expression
of activated AKT or of activated STAT3 exhibited strong
cyto-protective effects. In HCT116 colon cancer cells that
we had previously genetically manipulated to express
various mutant active H-RAS proteins we discovered that

expression of IRE1 or XBP1. In parallel, cells were transfected with an empty vector plasmid (CMV) or with plasmids to express: HSP90;
GRP78; HSP70; HSP27 or in the indicated combinations. Twenty-four h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle control or
[pemetrexed (1.0 µM) + sildenafil (2.0 µM) + sorafenib (2.0 µM)] for 12 h. Floating cells were then cytospun onto the 96 well plate and cell
viability determined. The percentage cell death under each transfection and treatment condition was calculated and values with a statistical
significance lower than the corresponding value CMV cells are in red; those whose value is greater than in CMV cells are green (*p < 0.05

further enhance killing by the three drug combination.
Expression of H-RAS V12 that could activate both the
PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways strong suppressed all druginduced killing processes and an H-RAS V12 protein
that could only activate PI3K showed similar protective
effects to those afforded by K-RAS D13. Expression
of an H-RAS V12 mutant that could only activate the
ERK1/2 pathway actually increased the lethality of the
drug combinations which is congruent with our prior
work which demonstrated that expression of a dominant
negative MEK1 protein suppressed [pemetrexed +
sorafenib] killing.
A number of our prior studies using sorafenib and
sildenafil had linked the biological action of these agents in
combination to the inhibition of HSP90 family and HSP70
family chaperones [1, 2, 5, 8, 10]. As was noted in the
companion manuscript we observed the over-expression
of chaperones, particularly when expressed in combination

reduced the killing potential of [pemetrexed + sorafenib +
sildenafil] [10]. Also, as was observed in the companion
study, we demonstrated that PKG-dependent signaling
downstream of sildenafil played a greater role in enhancing
the anti-tumor effect of [pemetrexed + sorafenib] than did
generation of nitric oxide.
In an animal model of NSCLC, we found that
sildenafil interacted in a greater than additive fashion to
suppress the growth of H460 tumors. In the companion
paper [pemetrexed + sildenafil] treatment reduced the
-fold increase in H460 tumor volume from 8.3-fold
in vehicle treated animals to 3.2-fold for drug treated
tumors [10]. For tumors treated with [pemetrexed +
sorafenib + sildenafil] the -fold increase in volume was
only 2.4-fold, that was significantly lower than the antitumor effect of [pemetrexed + sildenafil] (p < 0.05).
At present a phase II trial combining pemetrexed and
sorafenib in previously treated triple negative breast

Figure 6: Sildenafil enhances the anti-tumor effects of pemetrexed in vivo. (A) H460 cells into the rear flank of male athymic

mice (the H460 cell line was isolated from a male patient). Tumors were permitted to form and the animals treated with vehicle control,

[pemetrexed + sorafenib] treatment. (B) The mechanisms by which sildenafil enhances the lethality of [pemetrexed + sorafenib]. See
also reference 10, Figure 14. As a thymidylate synthase inhibitor pemetrexed causes DNA damage and increases the levels of ZMP due
to inhibition of AICAR. Sildenafil, as a PDE5 inhibitor, increases the levels of cGMP which activates PKG and subsequently leads to the
generation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide enhances the activation of ATM caused initially by DNA damage. ATM signals to activate the AMPK
which is further allosterically activated by ZMP. Collectively this strong AMPK signal inactivates RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting in the
inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Downstream of mTOR is the kinase ULK-1; the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1
S317 phosphorylation which activates the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation reduces ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation
which also activates the kinase. Activated ULK-1 phosphorylates ATG13 which is the key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome
formation. Sildenafil-induced PKG signaling also acts to reduce the activities of multiple chaperone proteins which is augmented by DNA
damage induced ATM signaling. Sorafenib, in addition to inhibiting class III receptor tyrosine kinases, RAF-1 and B-RAF, also reduces
GRP78, HSP90 and HSP70 function that in turn lowers the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and AKT that results in lower expression
of ROS/RNS detoxifying enzymes such as TRX and SOD2. Reduced GRP78 function causes activation of PERK and subsequently eIF2α.
Enhanced eIF2α signaling reduces the transcription of proteins with short half-lives such as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and enhances
expression of Beclin1, DR4 and DR5. Thus the convergent actions of reduced GRP78, HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone activity and eIF2α
signaling lead to a profound reduction in the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL which facilitates death receptor signaling
through CD95, DR4 and DR5 to activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. ER stress-induced elevations of Beclin1 expression converge
with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation to produce high levels of autophagosome formation that, when fused with lysosomes and releasing
proteases into the cytosol, converges with the extrinsic apoptosis pathway to cleave BID and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor cell
killing downstream of the mitochondrion was mediated by AIF and not caspases 3/7. The tumoricidal actions of AIF were facilitated by
sorafenib reducing HSP70 functionality as this chaperone can sequester AIF in the cytosol and prevent its translocation to the nucleus.

Transfection of cells with siRNA or with
plasmids

cancer patients is open at VCU Massey Cancer Center,
with the first patient a confirmed partial response
(NCT02624700 (Poklepovic and Dent, unpublished
observations). It will be of interest, should this trial
confirm the efficacy of [pemetrexed + sorafenib] in this
patient population, whether a new trial can be initiated
adding sildenafil to the drug combination.

For Plasmids
Cells were plated and 24 h after plating, transfected.
Plasmids expressing a specific mRNA (or siRNA) or
appropriate vector control plasmid DNA was diluted in
50 μl serum-free and antibiotic-free medium (1 portion
for each sample). Concurrently, 2 μl Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), was diluted into 50 μl of serum-free
and antibiotic-free medium (1 portion for each sample).
Diluted DNA was added to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000
for each sample and incubated at room temperature for 30
min. This mixture was added to each well/dish of cells
containing 200 μl serum-free and antibiotic-free medium
for a total volume of 300 μl, and the cells were incubated
for 4 h at 37°C. An equal volume of 2× medium was then
added to each well. Cells were incubated for 24 h, then
treated with drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Pemetrexed was purchased from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA). Sildenafil and sorafenib tosylate was
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). TrypsinEDTA, DMEM, RPMI, penicillin-streptomycin
were purchased from GIBCOBRL (GIBCOBRL Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were purchased
from the ATCC and were not further validated beyond
that claimed by ATCC. Cells were re-purchased
every ~6 months. ADOR is a primary NSCLC isolate
donated to the Dent laboratory by the patient. The
plasmid to express GRP78/BiP/HSPA5 was kindly
provided to the Dent laboratory by Dr. A.S. Lee
(University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA);
all other plasmids were purchased from Addgene.
Commercially available validated short hairpin RNA
molecules to knock down RNA/protein levels were
from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) (Supplementary Figure 8).
Reagents and performance of experimental procedures
were described in refs: [1, 2, 6–10].

Transfection for siRNA
Cells from a fresh culture growing in log phase as
described above, and 24 h after plating transfected. Prior
to transfection, the medium was aspirated and serum-free
medium was added to each plate. For transfection, 10 nM
of the annealed siRNA, the positive sense control doubled
stranded siRNA targeting GAPDH or the negative control
(a “scrambled” sequence with no significant homology
to any known gene sequences from mouse, rat or human
cell lines) were used. Ten nM siRNA (scrambled or
experimental) was diluted in serum-free media. Four μl
Hiperfect (Qiagen) was added to this mixture and the
solution was mixed by pipetting up and down several
times. This solution was incubated at room temp for 10
min, then added drop-wise to each dish. The medium
in each dish was swirled gently to mix, then incubated
at 37°C for 2 h. Serum-containing medium was added
to each plate, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h
before then treated with drugs (0–24 h). Additional
immuno-fluorescence/live-dead analyses were performed
at the indicated time points.

Methods
Culture and in vitro exposure of cells to drugs
All cell lines were cultured at 37°C (5% (v/v CO2)
in vitro using RPMI supplemented with dialyzed 5%
(v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) Non-essential amino
acids. Cells growing in “complete” fetal calf serum that
contains thymidine were gradually weaned into dialyzed
serum lacking thymidine over 2 weeks and were then
used for experimental analyses for the following 3 weeks
before discarding. Cells were re-isolated in thymidineless media as required. For short term cell killing assays,
immunoblotting studies, cells were plated at a density
of 3 × 103 per cm2 (~2 × 105 cells per well of a 12 well
plate) and 48 h after plating treated with various drugs,
as indicated. In vitro pemetrexed, sorafenib, regorafenib,
sildenafil and other drug treatments were generally from
a 100 mM stock solution of each drug and the maximal
concentration of Vehicle carrier (VEH; DMSO) in media
was 0.02% (v/v). Cells were not cultured in reduced serum
media during any study in this manuscript.

Animal studies
Studies were performed according to USDA
regulations under VCU IACUC protocol AD20008.
Athymic nude mice (~20 g) were injected with 1 × 107
H460 cells into their rear flank (10 animals per treatment
group; 4 groups; a total of 40 mice +/− SEM). Tumors
were permitted to form for 7 days with tumors at that time
exhibiting a mean volume of ~25 mm3. Athymic mice were
treated by oral gavage once every day QD for four days
as indicated in the Figure and Figure Legend with vehicle
(Cremophore); with pemetrexed (50 mg/kg) only on day 1;

with sildenafil (5 mg/kg) on days 1–3 and/or with sorafenib
(25 mg/kg) on Days 1–3. After cessation of drug treatment
tumors are again calipered as indicated in the Figure and
tumor volume was assessed up to 20–30 days later.
Detection of cell viability, protein expression
and protein phosphorylation by immuno-fluorescence
using a Hermes WiScan machine. http://www.idea-bio.
com/, Cells (4 × 103) are plated into each well of a 96
well plate, and cells permitted to attach and grow for the
next 18 h. Based on the experiment, after 18 h, cells are
then either genetically manipulated, or are treated with
drugs. For genetic manipulation, cells are transfected
with plasmids or siRNA molecules and incubated for an
additional 24 h. Cells are treated with vehicle control or
with drugs at the indicated final concentrations, alone or
in combination. Cells are then isolated for processing
at various times following drug exposure. The 96 well
plate is centrifuged/cyto-spun to associate dead cells (for
live-dead assays) with the base of each well. For live
dead assays, after centrifugation, the media is removed
and cells treated with live-dead reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham MA) and after 10 min this is removed
and the cells in each well are visualized in the Hermes
instrument at 10X magnification. Green cells = viable;
yellow/red cells = dying/dead. The numbers of viable
and dead cells were counted manually from three images
taken from each well combined with data from another
two wells of separately treated cells (i.e. the data is the
mean cell dead from 9 data points from three separate
exposures). For immuno-fluorescence studies, after
centrifugation, the media is removed and cells are fixed
in place and permeabilized using ice cold PBS containing
0.4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100. After
30 min the cells are washed three times with ice cold
PBS and cells are pre-blocked with rat serum for 3 h.
Cells are then incubated with a primary antibody to detect
the expression/phosphorylation of a protein (usually at
1:100 dilution from a commercial vendor) overnight at
37°C. Cells are washed three times with PBS followed
by application of the secondary antibody containing an
associated fluorescent red or green chemical tag. After
3 h of incubation the antibody is removed and the cells
washed again. The cells are visualized at either 10× or
60× in the Hermes machine for imaging assessments.
All immunofluorescent images for each individual
protein/phospho-protein are taken using the identical
machine settings so that the levels of signal in each
image can be directly compared to the level of signal in
the cells treated with drugs. Similarly, for presentation,
the enhancement of image brightness/contrast using
PhotoShop CS6 is simultaneously performed for each
individual set of protein/phospho-protein to permit direct
comparison of the image intensity between treatments.

Other antibodies were as used in prior studies by the
laboratory. All immunofluorescent images were initially
visualized at 75 dpi using an Odyssey infrared imager
(Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), then processed at 9999 dpi using
Adobe Photoshop CS6. For presentation, immunoblots
were digitally assessed using the provided Odyssey imager
software. Images have their color removed and labeled
figures generated in Microsoft PowerPoint.

Data analysis
Comparison of the effects of various treatments was
performed using one-way analysis of variance and a two
tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical examination of in vivo
animal survival data utilized log rank statistical analyses
between the different treatment groups. Differences with a
p-value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Experiments shown are the means of multiple individual
