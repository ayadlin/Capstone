Abstract
Local control and overall survival in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC)
remains dismal. Signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, and activation of the Hh effector transcription factor Gli1 is a poor prognostic factor in this disease
setting. Here, we report that increased GLI1 expression in the leading edge of HNSCC tumors is further increased
by irradiation, where it contributes to therapeutic inhibition. Hh pathway blockade with cyclopamine suppressed
GLI1 activation and enhanced tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy. Furthermore, radiotherapy-induced GLI1
expression was mediated in part by the mTOR/S6K1 pathway. Stroma exposed to radiotherapy promoted rapid
tumor repopulation, and this effect was suppressed by Hh inhibition. Our results demonstrate that Gli1 that is
upregulated at the tumor–stroma intersection in HNSCC is elevated by radiotherapy, where it contributes to
stromal-mediated resistance, and that Hh inhibitors offer a rational strategy to reverse this process to sensitize
HNSCC to radiotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7024–36. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains
a devastating malignancy with approximately 50% ﬁve-year
overall survival (OS) rates (1). During and immediately after
treatment, a process called accelerated repopulation occurs in
HNSCC whereby a few surviving cells rapidly proliferate leading to tumor recurrence (2) but this process still requires
elucidation.
One proposed mechanism for how tumor epithelial cells
become resistant to therapy is transformation into a more
mesenchymal phenotype known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT; ref. 3). Recent reports have linked hedgehog
pathway (HhP) signaling to EMT induction following (chemo)

radiotherapy in gastric (4, 5), esophageal (6), colorectal (7),
ovarian (8), and endometrial (9) cancers. Transcriptional activation of pro-EMT genes by Gli1 can lead to mesenchymal
changes (i.e., spindle cell shape, pseudopodia formation) and
increased tumor invasiveness. Targeting the HhP or its downstream EMT targets can lead to reversal of the mesenchymal
(stem cell "like") phenotype and restoration of chemoradiotherapy sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of RTOG 9003 demonstrated that patients with HNSCC who expressed
high levels of Gli1 before treatment had poor local control (LC)
rates, more distant metastases, and worse OS; when correlated
with those patients also expressing high levels of EGFR, these
patients had the worst outcomes overall (10). We previously
demonstrated in HNSCC xenografts that EGFR inhibition leads
to upregulation of the HhP in EGFR-dependent, human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC (11). The interrelatedness
of these different pathways suggests that inhibition of both
EGFR and the HhP may be necessary to maximize the effectiveness of radiotherapy in HNSCC.
The role HhP plays in radiotherapy resistance and tumor
repopulation in HNSCC remains unknown. We hypothesize
that radiotherapy similarly modulates the HhP in EGFRdependent tumors such as HNSCC and could be a mechanism
for resistance. Our work examines intratumor regional differences in HhP signaling, how radiotherapy modulates the HhP,
and the effect of HhP inhibition with cyclopamine on HhP
gene expression, cell survival, and EMT phenotype in the
context of radiotherapy. We propose an alternative mechanism where radiotherapy-induced Gli1 nuclear (nGLI1) translocation and GLI1 gene expression is mediated through the
mTOR pathway. Finally, we show that the tumorigenicity of

Tumor and Stromal Dependence on Hedgehog Pathway Signaling

serially cotransplanted tumor and stroma cells increases after
radiation and can be abrogated by HhP inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drugs
HN11 and TU167 HNSCC cell lines have been previously
described (11–17). siRNA (AKT, S6K1) was completed in
serum-free media using 1.3 mL/mL Dharmafect 1 (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) and 100 nmol/L siRNA. GLI1 silencing was completed using doxycycline-inducible (0.5 mg/ml) pTRIPZ lentiviral constructs (RHS4696-99636732) that introduced shRNA
as previously described (11). Cells were treated with 1 mmol/L
cyclopamine (LC Laboratories), 1 mmol/L Rapamycin (LC
Laboratories), or 1 mmol/L PF-4708671 (Sigma-Aldrich) for a
minimum of 12 hours before irradiation. Generation of chronically irradiated cell lines were performed by irradiating cells at
50% to 60% conﬂuency daily at 2 Gy/day for 5 days. Cells were
allowed to recover for 1 to 2 weeks before initiating the second
irradiation cycle. Cells were allowed 1 to 2 weeks for recovery
before initiating any studies.
Irradiation
Cells and animals were irradiated using a RS-2000 (Rad
Source Technologies, Inc). Cells were irradiated with 2 or 10
Gy using a 160 KVp source, at 25 mAmp, and at a dose rate of
1.15 Gy/minute. Mice were irradiated using a customized
animal restraint exposing only the head/neck region of the
mouse. Radiation dose and dose rate were calculated empirically for the RS-2000.
Colony formation assay
Serial dilutions were performed and single cells were plated
on 6-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 16 hours
before drug treatment and irradiated with a single dose (0–10
Gy) at least 8 hours after drug treatment. Cells were washed 3
days after initial drug exposure and grown for an additional 7 to
10 days until visible colonies on the control plate could be
measured. Cells were ﬁxed in 10% formalin solution, stained
with 0.5% crystal violet and washed with cold tap water.
Threshold for positive proliferative colonies were 50 cells.
Experiments were replicated either two or three times to
generate the radiotherapy dose response curves or the radiotherapy–cyclopamine cell sensitivity assay curves, respectively.
Human xenograft therapeutic studies
HN11 and TU167 parental cell lines were implanted into
athymic nude mice using an established ﬂoor-of-the mouth
(FOTM) method as previously described (18). Seventy-ﬁve
thousand cells were resuspended 1:1 in a DMEM/FBS and
Matrigel mixture and kept on ice until tumor implantation. A 4arm study was performed to generate efﬁcacy data. Arms used
for the parental tumors were: (i) control; (ii) cyclopamine 40
mg/kg by oral gavage everyday for 15 days excluding weekends;
(iii) radiotherapy 5 Gy once per week for 3 weeks; or (iv) both.
When the average tumors reached 100 mm3, mice were distributed into their respective groups. Tumor size was evaluated
twice per week using the following formula: volume ¼ [length
 width2]/2. For pharmacodynamic analysis on experimental
day 10, tumors were extracted 1 hour after drug administration

www.aacrjournals.org

and/or 48 hours after radiotherapy and divided into one of two
groups: formalin ﬁxation or FACS.
We performed a pharmacodynamic study by implanting
HNSCC into FOTM and assigning them to one of the four
treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S3A). After receiving the
prescribed therapy, tumors were collected from each group,
mouse stroma (anti-mouse H2Kd, BioLegend) and human
tumor cells (anti-Epcam; Cell Signaling Technology) were
separated by FACS, recombined in a 1:3 ratio (5,000:15,000)
with untreated tumor cells, and implanted onto the ﬂanks of
athymic nude mice. Tumor regrowth was assessed at 3 and 6
weeks after implantation and all tumors were excised at 6
weeks for analysis.
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed, student paired t test (GraphPad Prism) was used
to compare groups for both in vitro and in vivo experiments. A
majority of cell-based experiments were replicated three times
with a minimum of three replicates per experiment. In vivo
animal experiment statistics were performed on a minimum of
5 animals per group for comparison. Statistical comparisons
were performed by group. Statistical values were shown only if
P < 0.05.
Additional RNA, protein, and immunohistochemical methods are discussed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
HhP upregulation in the growing edge of HNSCC tumors
Utilizing our established patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
model system (18), mouse stroma, tumor margin, and tumor
center were isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM)
from control or irradiated ﬂash-frozen ﬂank tumors (Fig. 1A),
and evaluated for species-speciﬁc GLI1 expression. In nonirradiated tumors, hGLI1 at the tumor margin was 4.7 times
higher compared with the tumor center (P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 1B).
When comparing irradiated tumor to nonirradiated tumor,
normalized hGLI1 was signiﬁcantly upregulated at the margin
(8.8; P ¼ 0.02) compared with the center (2.7; P ¼ 0.2).
Human sonic hedgehog (SHH), was also signiﬁcantly upregulated at the tumor margin by 9.2 times in irradiated tumors (P
¼ 0.02). Furthermore, mGli1 demonstrated a nonsigniﬁcant
trend toward upregulation (4.1) in the mouse stroma
(Fig. 1C). Results were performed from a single experiment in
triplicate. We examined Gli1 expression following radiotherapy
by immunohistochemistry (IHC; Fig. 1D) at a single time point
that demonstrated upregulation of Gli1 protein but was not
differentially increased between the margin and center.
Radiotherapy upregulates the HhP
We used two established human epithelial HPV-negative
HNSCC cell lines collected from patients with FOTM SCC (19),
HN11 from a primary tumor, and TU167 from a relapsed
subject to conﬁrm our in vivo observations. We determined
whole transcriptome expression differences quantitatively and
found dissimilar gene expression levels in the hedgehog, epithelial cell markers, and mTOR pathways (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Consistent with being a relapsed, more transformed cell
type, TU167, had decreased epithelial cell markers and

increased HhP and mTOR pathway expression. After radiotherapy, GLI1 as well as downstream EMT genes ZEB2 and
SNAI1 were acutely and signiﬁcantly upregulated at 24 and 48
hours (Fig. 2A).
EMT is a potential mechanism explaining why LC can be
compromised due to accelerated repopulation following prolonged genotoxic stress. We explored whether chronic irradiation modulated HhP and EMT-associated genes. Chronically
irradiated HN11 demonstrated upregulation in HhP (GLI1,
GLI2) and EMT (ZEB2, VIM) genes compared with the parental
line. In TU167, we observed upregulation of the EMT pathway
genes GLI2 and TWIST1 (Fig. 2B). FACS of chronically irradiated HN11 demonstrated increased VIM expression (4% of
the total population), indicating that a small fraction of these
cells have assumed a mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 2C). VIM
was higher in parental TU167 compared with HN11 and was
not signiﬁcantly upregulated by sustained radiotherapy.

Effect of cyclopamine on radiotherapy-mediated GLI1
upregulation
To test whether radiotherapy-induced GLI1 upregulation
could be suppressed through HhP inhibition, we used the
Smoothened receptor inhibitor cyclopamine. Pretreatment
with 1 mmol/L cyclopamine followed by radiotherapy signiﬁcantly suppressed radiotherapy-induced GLI1 in HN11 but not
in TU167 (Fig. 3A). Using shGLI1, we documented partial GLI1
suppression in HN11 but not in TU167 following radiotherapy
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Cells pretreated with 1 mmol/L cyclopamine demonstrated no signiﬁcant change in nGLI1 content
at 1, 2, and 4 hours. Despite inhibition with cyclopamine, we still
observed a 2-fold increase in nGli1 in HN11 and TU167 (Fig. 3B,
ﬁrst and third panels) after radiotherapy. Similarly, cytoplasmic
Gli1 (cGli1) was similarly increased following irradiation and
suppressed with cyclopamine pretreatment. Interestingly, cGli1
levels were unable to be fully suppressed following irradiation

despite pretreatment with cyclopamine. This effect was more
pronounced in TU167 compared with HN11 (Fig. 3B, second and
fourth panels). Treating with higher (but not clinically achievable) concentrations of cyclopamine (10 mmol/L) led to significant inhibition of radiotherapy-induced GLI1 expression suggesting a dose–response effect (data not shown).
Using colony formation assay (CFA), the primary cell line
HN11 was signiﬁcantly more radiosensitive than TU167 at
lower radiotherapy doses (Fig. 3C). We then evaluated whether
cyclopamine inhibition could enhance cytotoxicity at single
radiation dose. Combinatorial therapy with cyclopamine þ
radiotherapy demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect compared with
single modality therapy or no treatment (control vs. 1 mmol/L
þ radiotherapy: TU167, P ¼ 0.003; HN11, P ¼ 0.0006) with the
greatest response seen in HN11 (Fig. 3D) compared with
TU167 (Fig. 3E). Chronically irradiated HN11 cells exposed to
1 mmol/L cyclopamine for 12 hours demonstrated a trend
towards suppressing GLI1 (1.7  0.3–1.5  0.2, n.s.), GLI2 (1.7 
0.03–1.1  0.02, P ¼ 0.0025), and VIM (3.0  0.2–1.1  0.1, P ¼
0.0043). No trend was observed for TU167 for GLI1, GLI2, or
VIM. These ﬁndings demonstrated that chronically irradiated
HN11 cells that induce HhP- and EMT-associated genes were
responsive to cyclopamine inhibition.
In vivo effect of radiotherapy and cyclopamine in an
orthotopic HNSCC model
To further our in vitro observations, we evaluated tumors in
vivo, combining cyclopamine and radiotherapy. Mice were

www.aacrjournals.org

implanted in the FOTM (Fig. 4A) with either HN11 or TU167
cell lines and randomized to one of the four treatment arms
(Fig. 4B). Radiotherapy  cyclopamine led to a reduction in
tumor volume, compared with control or cyclopamine alone in
HN11 and TU167 parental tumors (Fig. 4C and D). Of note,
cyclopamine had no effect on inhibiting tumor growth in HN11
and, similar to the control arm, the tumor continued to grow. It
has not been reported in the literature that cyclopamine
stimulates tumor proliferation and, given the size of the error
bar compared with the control arm, is unlikely to be suggestive
of the above hypothesis. In HN11, tumor volumes responded
dramatically to radiotherapy (67% reduction) or the combination treatment (77% reduction), which correlated well with
their in vitro susceptibility to radiotherapy (Fig. 4C). In TU167,
we observed smaller tumor sizes in both the radiotherapy
alone and combinatorial therapy arms (radiotherapy: 37%
reduction compared with control; cyclopamineþ radiotherapy: 49% reduction compared with control; Fig. 4D). TU167irradiated tumors had a propensity for developing cystic,
cavitated lesions (radiotherapy: 3/10 tumors; dual therapy:
8/10; Supplementary Fig. S3A) beginning around day 25. At
day 45, representative cystic and noncystic TU167 tumors were
harvested from euthanized mice for analysis. The noncystic
tumors by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were solid throughout
compared with the cystic tumors, which were only a thin rim of
tissue (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Tumor proliferation evaluated using Ki67 for the noncystic tumors revealed that control
(H-score: 80) or cyclopamine-treated (H-score: 80) tumors

demonstrated the highest amount of Ki67 staining compared
with radiotherapy (H-score: 65) or dual therapy–treated (Hscore: 40) tumors. The dual therapy–treated tumors demonstrated the most reduced Ki67 staining both in the periphery
and core (Supplementary Fig. S3C). This suggests that there
was both increased necrosis and decreased proliferation in
radiotherapy and dual treated TU167 tumors, in spite of small
volumetric differences. In comparison, the cystic versus noncystic radiotherapy treatment tumors suggest less proliferating cells in the cystic tumors and growth is restricted to the
tumor margin/edge.
Tumors were harvested for pharmacodynamic analysis 10
days into treatment and immunohistochemical staining performed for EGFR, Gli1, ALDH1, and BMI1. EGFR staining
conﬁrmed presence of HNSCC cells over mouse stroma. Faint
Gli1 expression was observed in control cells and this was
signiﬁcantly upregulated throughout the tumor following
radiotherapy. Radiotherapy-induced Gli1 expression could be
partially abrogated by cyclopamine treatment [Fig. 5, HN11
(left) and TU167 (right)]. When evaluating the mouse stroma,
we similarly observed an increase in stromal Gli1 following
radiotherapy and a pronounced decrease with dual therapy by

H-score. In particular, we observed a pronounced effect with
cyclopamine alone in suppressing mouse stromal GLI1 in
TU167 over HN11 (Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, ALDH1
and BMI1 were upregulated following radiotherapy and partially inhibited by cyclopamine.
Given our in vitro and in vivo ﬁndings, we next sought to
explore: (i) an alternative mechanism that may drive tumor
Gli1 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation independent of the
canonical HhP and (ii) whether inhibition of HhP in stromal
cells can block tumor repopulation in vivo.
mTOR/S6K1 mediates GLI1 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear
translocation
In both cell lines, despite inhibition with signiﬁcant concentrations of cyclopamine, radiotherapy was still able to
induce GLI1 gene expression and increase nGli1 accumulation,
suggesting that an accessory pathway (independent of canonical HhP signaling) may be driving radiotherapy-induced nGli1
accumulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that radiotherapy
could activate the mTOR/S6K1 pathway and enhance Gli1
cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation (Fig. 6A). Following
radiotherapy, GLI1 was upregulated by 24 hours in both HN11

(Continued.) nGLI1 accumulation was evaluated by immunoblot and temporal fold changes described. C, CFA radiotherapy dose curves were generated from
serially diluted cells grown on 6-well plates treated 24 hours after adhesion with 0–10 Gy irradiation. Cells were ﬁxed, stained, and counted approximately
8–10 days after radiotherapy. CFAs were performed to assess the effect of cyclopamine and 2 Gy radiotherapy on cell growth and survival on HN11 (D) and
TU167 (E). Eight hours before irradiation, cells were pretreated with 1 mmol/L cyclopamine in low serum media. Low serum media was chosen as it more closely
represents the tumor milieu. Furthermore, use of low serum media before drug treatment will prevent exogenous growth factors from competing with the
effects of cyclopamine. Statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings are denoted:  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001. n.s., nonsigniﬁcant.

and TU167 (Fig. 6B), and pretreatment with 1 mmol/L ZSTK474
(AKT inhibitor) was able to signiﬁcantly suppress GLI1 expression in HN11 following radiotherapy but not in TU167 (data not
shown). This resistance was consistent with the observed
overexpression of the mTOR pathway in TU167, and use of
a more speciﬁc inhibitor was warranted. Following pretreatment with 1 mmol/L rapamycin, we observed suppression of
both GLI1 mRNA and Gli1 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear protein
accumulation following radiotherapy in TU167 (Fig. 6C). We
observe a similar increase in cGli1 following irradiation and the
irradiation effect can similarly be suppressed with rapamycin
pretreatment. In contrast, HN11 inhibition with rapamycin did
not prevent radiotherapy-induced nGli1 accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S4) and is in contrast to our mRNA results. Our
transcriptome results may offer an answer for this discrepancy,
where TU167 has greater mTOR gene expression compared

with HN11 and may be more sensitive to the effects of mTOR
inhibition, which may translate into diminished Gli1 accumulation. Cellular Gli1 content is known to be regulated both at
the transcriptional and proteasomal level (20). The suppression of GLI1 may suggest that the role of rapamycin may be to
regulate gene expression and perhaps is irrespective of nuclear
protein accumulation.
Next, we evaluated whether inhibition of the downstream
mTOR effector S6K1 could prevent nGli1 accumulation. Similarly, GLI1 expression was signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of S6K1 inhibitor (1 mmol/L PF-4708671) following radiotherapy (Fig. 6B). We attempted to determine whether loss of
S6K1 could similarly suppress GLI1 expression and prevent
nuclear Gli1protein accumulation. Four siRNA constructs were
screened and their ability to suppress S6K1 expression by
mRNA and immunoblot were assessed. The two best candidate

constructs were then selected. Both siRNA constructs suppressed expression of S6K1. ppS6K1 was still observed despite
knockdown and was completely absent following radiotherapy. Our results suggest that inhibition with one siRNA construct was able to suppress nGli1 accumulation in both HN11
and TU167. However, the other siRNA construct gave contrary
results and does not appear to suppress radiotherapy-induced
Gli1 nuclear accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Our ﬁndings suggest a possible link between mTOR/S6K1 and nGli1
accumulation but must be interpreted with caution.
In vivo tumor repopulation following radiotherapy
Locoregional failure due to tumor repopulation following
radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy remains a signiﬁcant
problem. In vitro and in vivo studies have implicated that
genotoxically stressed tumor or ﬁbroblast cells may play a
role in tumor repopulation. In vivo, tumor and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts (stroma) are closely admixed with one
another. On the basis of our PDX and TU167 in vivo results
demonstrating increased mouse stromal Gli1 following radiotherapy, subsequent suppression by pretreatment with cyclopamine and the signiﬁcant response of TU167 tumors to dual
therapy, we hypothesized that cyclopamine may also target
the tumor stroma and given its combined affect on TU167 in
vivo, may inhibit tumor repopulation. We treated orthotopically implanted TU167 tumors with vehicle, cyclopamine,
radiotherapy, or the combination, surgically resected them,
separated tumor and stroma compartments by ﬂow cytometry, and coimplanted these in different permutations with
untreated tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A). This
addressed whether the irradiated tumor or stroma could
enhance tumor repopulation and whether inhibition of the
HhP could abrogate repopulation. We observed a signiﬁcant
10-fold difference in tumor regrowth at 3 weeks favoring the
irradiated stroma combined with fresh tumor cell lines (SRT:
T) compared with the nonirradiated control stroma:tumor
(SC:T) pairing (P ¼ 0.01). When stroma cells pretreated with
cyclopamine and radiotherapy were combined with fresh
tumor (SD:T), we observed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor
regrowth rates at 3 weeks when SD:T was compared against
SRT:T (P ¼ 0.007) implicating that HhP following radiotherapy
may be involved in stroma-mediated tumor repopulation (Fig.
7A). We also evaluated TRT:T pairings and observed a similar
though nonsigniﬁcant trend in tumor regrowth at 3 weeks.
(Fig. 7A; Supplementary Table S2). When we evaluated the
same pairings between SRT:T versus TRT:T, there was greater
than a 4-fold difference in size favoring the SRT:T over the
tumor:tumor pairing (P ¼ 0.03; Supplementary Table
S2). Figure 7B shows representative mice with S:T and T:T
pairings at 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, the TRT:T pairings continued
to demonstrate a signiﬁcant trend towards smaller tumor
sizes (267  27 mm3 vs. 579  102 mm3) compared with the
SRT:T pairings (P ¼ 0.05). Representative excised tumors from
all animals continued to demonstrate that SRT cells conferred
a signiﬁcant growth advantage over SC or SCyc (nonradiotherapy) stroma. Furthermore, tumors pretreated with cyclopamine were able to inhibit tumor regrowth despite being
irradiated (Fig. 7A and C).

Discussion
Radiotherapy remains the cornerstone for local management of HNSCC either deﬁnitively or in the postoperative
setting. Whether radiotherapy can induce GLI1/HhP upregulation through an EMT phenotype as a mechanism for tumor
repopulation and the respective relevance of irradiated cancer
cells versus intratumor stromal cells for tumor repopulation
remain unknown. Accelerated tumor repopulation following
radiotherapy is associated with locoregional recurrence in
patients and a better understanding of this mechanism is
critical to improve LC and OS.
The interface between tumor margin/edge and tumor stroma is an important distinction for cancer biology. First, we
demonstrated that GLI1 is signiﬁcantly upregulated at the
tumor edge compared with the core in nonirradiated samples.
Second, following radiotherapy, GLI1 gene expression was
upregulated at the peripheral tumor edge compared with the
tumor core. Of note, this was taken at a solitary time point (48
hours after radiotherapy), and even though overall Gli1 content
has increased in both cells, there is no observed preference for
staining at the tumor edge. On the basis of this experiment,
accumulation of nGli1 preferentially at the tumor edge may
occur more rapidly as our immunoblot results suggest and
therefore tumor harvested at an earlier time point might
illustrate this.
First, the implications of our ﬁndings are important because
tumors with upregulated Gli1 and/or the EMT pathway have
been shown to be more chemo- and radioresistant, more
locally invasive, and metastatic (7, 21–23). Second, the peripheral tumor cells model those cell islands left behind after
surgical resection ("positive margin"). This is clinically significant as a positive margin indicates a high risk for recurrence
and patients with positive margins often experience greater
local and distant failure rates when they fail to receive adequate doses of radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (24, 25). The
change in tumor milieu, increased inﬂammation, and local
hypoxia following surgery may provide additional factors that
allow a high Gli1-expressing tumor more opportunity to proliferate/ﬂourish compared with a low Gli1-expressing tumor.
Our results demonstrated that GLI1 expression is inherently
higher at the tumor margin compared with the core and that
radiotherapy can further induce GLI1 overexpression at the
tumor margin. However, these ﬁndings need to be cautiously
interpreted and we caveat that tumor heterogeneity may cause
variations in gene expression between tumor margin and
center and this may explain the more uniform Gli1 protein
expression following irradiation observed by IHC as compared
with the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT)-PCR results, which
demonstrated greater GLI1 expression at the tumor margin.
Another explanation is that radiotherapy leads to GLI1 upregulation, which in turn upregulates certain EMT-associated
genes. A limited number of these cells that are more EMT-like
can transform to a more mesenchymal phenotype and settle in
to the existing environment or translocate away from the
source of insult (i.e., local radiotherapy). As they are away
from the area of insult, these cells can downregulate various
mesenchymal genes and reestablish their epithelial phenotype
(mesenchymal-to-epithelial phenotype) allowing them to grow

in a new microenvironment. This has been illustrated in a
squamous cell epithelial cancer model using a conditional
doxycycline regulatory system controlling TWIST1 expression
(26). The authors demonstrated that TWIST1 expression was
necessary for EMT but shutting down TWIST1 was necessary
for establishing distant metastasis. This explanation takes into
account both the tumor margin and heterogeneity issues
providing a possible mechanism for Gli1-mediated treatment
failure and distant metastasis.
In the chronically irradiated cells, we observed that HhP
genes, GLI1 and GLI2, and EMT genes, ZEB2, TWIST1, and VIM,
were upregulated though not as robustly as when cells were

acutely irradiated. These genes remained elevated 2 to 8 weeks
after radiotherapy, suggesting that a surviving population of
irradiated cancer cells adapt gene expression, allowing for
survival and repopulation. Other groups, including our own,
have demonstrated that inhibition of HhP or EMT pathway
genes, TWIST, SNAI1, or SLUG, can reverse (chemo)radiotherapy resistance and decrease tumor invasiveness, progression,
and metastasis (8, 9, 11, 22, 27). Therefore, we decided to
evaluate whether HhP inhibition could enhance tumor control
by either increasing radiosensitivity or preventing tumor
repopulation in vivo. A recent article indicated that inadequate
radiotherapy doses in other tumor cell lines can lead to

increased tumor regrowth mediated by the HhP (21). Therefore, direct inhibition of Gli1 activation in vivo may lead to
enhanced tumoricidal effects when combined with radiotherapy. When we treated our chronically irradiated HN11 cells
with cyclopamine, downregulation of GLI2 and VIM occurred,
indicating that HhP inhibition in HNC may be an appropriate
anticancer target when combined with radiotherapy.
Our IHC results demonstrated that Gli1 is upregulated in both
tumors and in the tumor stroma following radiotherapy and this
upregulation was mitigated with cyclopamine. Interestingly, the
downstream stem cell marker and DNA damage response
protein ALDH1 and BMI1, respectively, were both downregulated following cyclopamine therapy, suggesting that these
genes are regulated by Gli1 and that HhP inhibition may prevent
or slow the transition to a more "stem cell–like" state. In one
study evaluating patients with high versus low ALDH1 expression pre- and postsurgery, patients with colorectal cancer
undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who expressed
high levels of ALDH1 had greater rates of local failure and
recurrence (28). Expression of ALDH1 in HNSCC and colorectal
cancer is associated with increased nodal and distant metastasis, worse OS, and is mediated through TWIST1 and SNAI1
expression (29, 30). These ﬁndings highlight the concern that
chemoradiotherapy can induce ALDH1 (and BMI1) expression
which is a poor prognostic factor. Our results are the ﬁrst to
demonstrate that adding cyclopamine to radiotherapy can
suppress Gli1 expression in HPV-negative HNC and thereby
downregulate ALDH1 and BMI1 expression in vivo.
Accelerated tumor repopulation following radiotherapy is a
well-known phenomenon but its mechanism remains
unknown. Our in vitro results suggest that both HN11 and
TU167 upregulate the HhP acutely and chronically following
radiotherapy. Furthermore, cyclopamine can suppress radiotherapy-induced GLI1 in HN11 but not in TU167 despite our in
vivo results, and this is likely due to lower baseline levels of HhP
expression in HN11 compared with TU167. Given the difference in our in vitro versus our in vivo data, this led us to
question whether an alternative target may be the stroma. Our
own LCM qRT-PCR and IHC results (Figs. 1C and 4E) show the
mouse stroma also upregulated GLI1 following radiotherapy
but that GLI1 is suppressed following cyclopamine treatment.
One possible explanation is that irradiated stroma may provide
a nurturing environment to allow circulating mesenchymal
tumor cells a nidus to grow. Researchers have demonstrated
that irradiated ﬁbroblasts undergo changes, including matrix
remodeling (i.e., release of MMPs) and cytokine release (i.e.,
TGFb, basic FGF). This may allow for an altered albeit rich
growth environment allowing tumor cells to ﬂourish. A growing body of literature in prostate, breast, pancreas, and other
cancers suggests that HhP upregulation in the tumor microenvironment through paracrine signaling plays a substantial
role in tumor growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis
(27, 31–34). More speciﬁcally, cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts
(CAF) have been shown to upregulate both the Smoothened
receptor and in turn GLI1 (35) and SNAI1 (36), whereas another
group demonstrated that inhibition of Smoothened on CAFs in
turn translated to decreased GLI1 expression and the downstream EMT gene SNAI1 in pancreatic cancer cells (37), sup-

porting a paracrine signaling model for EMT. These ﬁndings
indicate that both stromal and tumor Gli1 may play an
important role in tumor treatment resistance and repopulation and targeting them may not only enhance CAF sensitivity
to genotoxic agents but also inhibit the EMT process in tumors.
Building on our ﬁndings, we hypothesized that the HhP may
play a role in the HPV negative tumor microenvironment and
tumor repopulation following radiotherapy. When we irradiated stroma and recombined them with fresh tumor cells, it
resulted in signiﬁcant rapid tumor regrowth after reimplantation compared with control or cyclopamine alone. Compared with the irradiated tumor recombined with fresh tumor
cells, we observed a nonsigniﬁcant trend at 3 weeks and a more
pronounced regrowth effect at 6 weeks. Interestingly, we did
not see substantial tumor regrowth in the irradiated stroma (or
tumors) treated with cyclopamine when combined with fresh
tumor at either time point. Our ﬁndings are novel as they
implicate Gli1 as a potential target in the stromal microenvironment important for radiotherapy-induced HNSCC tumor
(re)growth. However, additional work is needed to understand
what may be driving this regrowth but our ﬁndings suggest
that HhP may be involved. As the tumor microenvironment
decisively contributes to therapy resistance (38), modulating
its signaling through targeted therapy may enhance LC rates.
Our ﬁndings suggest that irradiated HPV-negative HNSCC
stroma (and to a lesser degree, irradiated HNSCC tumor)
utilize the HhP to mediate tumor repopulation. Identifying
the paracrine signaling molecule(s) interacting with the tumor
stroma will provide valuable information regarding tumor
biology that could be applied towards novel drug discovery.
There is a distinct lack of information regarding HPV-positive
HNSCC and the HhP in the literature. Given their excellent
response to traditional chemoradiotherapy, we would hypothesize that the HhP may not play as important a role but this will
need to be addressed with formal experimentation.
Our observation that GLI1- and EMT-associated genes and
proteins can be similarly upregulated following acute or
chronic irradiation implicates their importance as radioresponsive genes. Our transcriptome analysis of TU167 showed
that it was less epithelial compared with HN11 and had greater
gene enrichment for the Hedgehog and mTOR pathways.
Higher basal expression of HhP genes in TU167 may explain
its relative insensitivity to cyclopamine in vitro but this was
overcome with higher doses of drug. In esophageal cancer,
TNFa has been shown to activate/stabilize Gli1 via mTOR/
S6K1 and not through the canonical Smoothened pathway (6).
Furthermore, radiotherapy, either through EGFR phosphorylation (39) or directly through DNA damage response proteins
such as DNA-PKcs (40), has been shown to activate the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway. Our pharmacologic ﬁndings suggest that
radiotherapy-induced nGli1 translocation may signal through
the mTOR/S6K1 pathway in more mesenchymal appearing cell
lines such as TU167 and may be the primary driver for
radiotherapy-induced nGli1 accumulation. However, in more
epithelial cell lines such as HN11, rapamycin was unable to
suppress nGli1 accumulation yet GLI1 mRNA remained suppressed following pharmacologic inhibition. One possible
explanation is that rapamycin may affect GLI1 expression

irrespective of nuclear accumulation. One hypothesis is that
mesenchymal versus epithelial cells likely signal differently
upstream but converge through mTOR/S6K1. Others have
similarly demonstrated that the mTOR pathway is upregulated in head and neck cancers and may be an attractive
clinical target. One group has shown that rapamycin combined with an AKT inhibitor, enzastaurin, can decrease
survival, angiogenesis, and proliferation in preclinical HNC
models (41). Furthermore, two phase I clinical studies have
been completed: the ﬁrst in patients with resected, locally
advanced head and neck cancer combining everolimus,
weekly cisplatin, and radiation and the second, combining
everolimus with docetaxel and cisplatin as part of an induction chemotherapy regimen. Both clinical studies have demonstrated tolerability and safety and are presumed to be
progressing to phase II (42, 43). It is enticing to consider that
the combination of an mTOR inhibitor, cyclopamine, and
radiotherapy in patients with recurrent or locally advanced
head and neck cancer may be more efﬁcacious as it targets
both the tumor and stroma-mediated components involved
with tumor repopulation.
Our results show that the HhP and Gli1 play an important
role in HNSCC tumor biology. We have demonstrated that the
mTOR/S6K1 pathway may contribute to radiotherapy-induced
Gli1 signaling in vitro. Radiotherapy combined with targeting
HhP led to increased HNSCC cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo
and limited tumor repopulation in vivo. In locally recurrent or
metastatic head and neck tumors that may be mTOR driven,
combining mTOR and HhP inhibitors with radiotherapy may

allow an opportunity to target primary and alternative
mechanisms, including stroma signaling, which may lead to
improved therapeutic efﬁcacy.
