ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive brain tumor in adults.
In spite of advances in diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis of patients with GBM has
remained dismal. The fast recurrence and multi-drug resistance are some of the key
challenges in combating brain tumors. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) which are considered
the source of relapse and chemoresistance, the need for more effective therapeutic
options is overwhelming. In our present work, we found that combined treatment
with temozolomide (TMZ) and metformin (MET) synergistically inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis in both glioma cells and GSCs. Combination of TMZ and MET
significantly reduced the secondary gliosphere formation and expansion of GSCs. We
first demonstrated that MET effectively inhibited the AKT activation induced by TMZ,
and a combination of both drugs led to enhanced reduction of mTOR, 4EBP1 and S6K
phosphorylation. In addition, the combination of the two drugs was accompanied with
a powerful AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, while this pathway is not
determinant. Xenografts performed in nude mice demonstrate in vivo demonstrated
that combined treatment significantly reduced tumor growth rates and prolonged
median survival of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, TMZ in combination with MET
synergistically inhibits the GSCs proliferation through downregulation of AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway. The combined treatment of two drugs inhibits GSCs self-renewal
capability and partly eliminates GSCs in vitro and in vivo. This combined treatment
could be a promising option for patients with advanced GBM.

resistance are some of the key challenges in combating
brain tumors, control of the cancer stem cell population
is considered key to realizing the long-term survival of
GBM patients [3].
TMZ is the major chemotherapeutic drug used
clinically in the treatment of GBM. The primary path
leading to TMZ-induced cell death is formation of
O-6-methylguanine and apoptotic signaling triggered by
O-6-methyl G:T mispairs [4]. Recent studies suggested
that one of the cytotoxic mechanisms of TMZ on GBM
goes through an AMPK activation step [5]. Accumulating

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and
devastating primary malignant intracranial tumor in
adults. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed
GBM is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus
concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) [1]. The
prognosis is still relatively poor with a median overall
survival is only 14.6 months, median progression freesurvival is 6.9 months and 5 year survival rate only 9.8%
after diagnosis [1, 2]. The fast recurrence and multi-drug

self-renewing capacity of the tumor spheres was assayed
by dissociation of primary tumor spheres. When selfrenewal capacity was compared among tumor subtypes at
a plating density of 5 × 103 cells/well, U87 were found
to generate a greater mean number of secondary tumor
spheres(151 ± 5) compared with U251(136 ± 9) (Figure 2).
The cells within the sphere were positive to neural stem
cell markers CD133 (Figure 1A) and nestin (Figure 1B),
and lack of immunoreactivity for markers of differentiated
neural cell types such as GFAP for astrocytes and β-tubulin
III for neurons. The assay of multi-lineage differentiation
capacity of cells within the sphere was demonstrated
by culturing the cells in differentiation-inducing culture
medium (DMEM+10% FBS) for 7 days. These cells
lost expression of CD133 and nestin when subjected to
differentiating conditions, showed typical morphological
differentiation towards neuronal and astrocytic lineages,
identified as β-tubulin-III positive for neurons and GFAP
positive for astrocytes (Figure 1C and 1D).

evidence shows that GBM frequently displays
hyperactivation of the AKT pathway [6–8] and endogenous
AKT kinase activity can be activated in response to
clinically relevant concentrations of TMZ [9, 10]. Once
activated, AKT phosphorylates several substrates involved
in various cellular processes including cell proliferation,
survival, growth and metabolism [7, 11]. AKT activation
is also correlated with the increased tumorigenicity,
invasiveness and stemness [7]. It has demonstrated that
cancer stem cells are preferentially sensitive to an inhibitor
of AKT [8, 12] and down-regulation of the AKT pathway
can enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ [9, 13, 14].
Epidemiologic data have revealed that MET, a
first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, can reduce cancer
incidence and mortality in certain cancers [15, 16],
and increase the number of breast carcinoma patients
obtaining complete response to neo-adjuvant therapy [17].
Interestingly, studies have shown that metformin enhances
antitumor efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in vitro
and in vivo [18–20]. Recently, MET has been shown to
selectively kill cancer stem cells [21–24] with minor
adverse effects [25]. Its mechanism of antiproliferative
mainly by activating AMPK [22, 23] and inhibiting the
activity of AKT [24, 26]. On these bases, several clinical
trials are underway [27, 28]. Based on these preclinical
studies it has been proposed that the combination of MET
and TMZ may be an effective treatment for some cancer
types. Recently, Sesen et al [29] have proved that MET
treatment in combination with TMZ induces a synergistic
anti-tumoral response in glioma cell lines, however, the
mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Furthermore,
whether MET can potentiate the cytotoxicity of TMZ for
GSCs is still scantly explored.
In the present study, we first demonstrated that the
combination treatment of TMZ and MET synergistically
inhibited the growth and induced cell apoptosis in both
U87 GSCs and U251GSCs with accompanying enhanced
reduction of mTOR, S6K and 4EBP1 signaling. TMZ
induced AKT activation also was effectively inhibited
by MET. Although a combination of the two drugs was
associated with a powerful AMPK activation, but it is
not determinant. This synergy was confirmed in vivo by
demonstrating significant reduction in tumor burden and
significantly prolonged median survival of tumor-bearing
mice after combined drug treatment as compared with
treatment with either drug alone.

TMZ and MET combined to inhibit GSCs ­selfrenewal and inhibit gliosphere formation and
expansion
U87 GSCs and U251 GSCs sub-cultured in complete
NBM, promoted gliosphere formation in 5–7 days and
increased in size in 7–10 days. In vitro treatment with
TMZ or MET resulted in a obvious decrease in the number
and size of gliospheres generated from U87 and U251
glioma cells (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the combinatorial
treatment with MTZ and MET showed more significant
decrease in the number and size of gliospheres compare
with either drug alone (P < 0.01) (Figure 2A and 2B).
These results showed that the combined treatment of two
drugs inhibits GSCs self-renewal capability. These results
also suggested that combination treatment with TMZ and
MET contribute more effectively to inhibit U87 and U251
secondary gliosphere formation and expansion compare
with any single drug.

MET synergistically enhances the inhibitory
effects of TMZ on inhibiting glioma cell
proliferation
In order to determine whether the MET currently
in clinical trials for cancer treatment, can augment the
cell proliferation inhibitory effects of TMZ in glioma
cells and GSCs, glioma cells and GSCs (derived from
U87 and U251 glioma cell lines) were plated with TMZ
either alone or with MET, all cells were assessed using
the CCK-8 assay. U87, U87GSCs, U251 and U251
GSCs showed a dose- and time-dependent response to
proliferation inhibition by TMZ or/and MET (Figure 3).

alone (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), MET alone
(400mg/kg, by gavage), and the combination of TMZ
and MET at day 21 were 1350 ± 448 mm3, 550 ± 167
mm3, 630 ± 215 mm3, and 180 ± 114 mm3, respectively
(P < 0.01). Encouragingly, combinatorial treatment
significantly prolonged median survival of tumor bearing
mice. As shown in the Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 7B),
the median survivals were 21, 41, and 36 days for the
control, TMZ and MET groups, respectively (P< 0.01),
whereas combined treatment extended median survival by
54 days(P< 0.05, TMZ+MET vs single drug). Figure 7C
summarizes a possible network describing the principal
mechanisms influenced by TMZ and MET.

It has proved that endogenous AKT can be
activated in TMZ-treated cells [9], overexpression of an
active form of AKT increases glioma cell resistance to
TMZ [6] and inhibition of AKT function is associated
with increased cell sensitivity to TMZ [9]. MET has
been shown to exert antiproliferative activity on GSCs
through inhibition of the AKT-mTOR pathway [24]. To
explore whether MET augments the cytotoxicity of TMZ
by downregulation of AKT-mTOR signaling pathway,
we analyzed cell signaling changes after various drug
treatments (TMZ, MET, TMZ and MET) in U87GSCs
and U251 GSCs. As shown Figure 6A, in U87 GSCs,
TMZ induced AKT phosphorylation in a timedependent manner and MET decreased phosphorylation
of AKT in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MET
effectively reversed the AKT activation induced
by TMZ after 48 hours treatment (Figure 6B). We
although found that single-agent treatment with TMZ
or MET showed obvious inhibition of phosphorylated
mTOR, 4EBP1, and PS6K, under combination of
the two drugs, the activated forms of these proteins
were significantly suppressed under their combination
(Figure 6B).
To further explore whether AKT-mTOR is involved
in the synergistic effect from the combination treatment.
We knocked down AKT-mTOR using NVP-BEZ235,
a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (20nM). We examined the
ability of NVP-BEZ235 to potentiate cell apoptosis in
response to TMZ, and MET either alone or in combination
(Figure 6C). Compared with single drug, treatment with
NVP-BEZ235 significantly increases cell apoptosis in
combination with TMZ or MET under standard growth
conditions after 48 hours (P < 0.05). In addition, we found
that the combination of NVP-BEZ235 with both TMZ
and MET effectively promoted extensive cell apoptosis
within 48 hours in U87 GSCs and U251 GSCs (P < 0.05)
(Figure 6C and 6D). All together, these results show that
TMZ combined with MET synergize to inhibit GSCs
proliferation through downregulation of AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway, since addition of AKT-mTOR inhibitor
such as NVPBEZ-235 promotes massive and rapid cell
death.

DISCUSSION
To date, no efficient and effective targeted therapies
are available for GBM. The cancer stem cell theory has
brought consciousness that eradicating cancer stem cells
may overturn the drug-resistance after chemoradiation
or targeted therapy [30, 31]. The catalog of documented
genetic alterations found in GBM, with many occurring
concurrently, suggests that single drug targeted therapies
are unlikely to be effective in most patients [22, 32,
33]. In the present study, we focused on the synergistic
mechanism of MET, an AKT inhibitor and AMPK agonist,
to enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ. We demonstrated
for the first time that TMZ combined with MET more
significantly inhibited GSCs growth both in vitro and
in  vivo compared with single drug treatment.
Our in vitro results demonstrated that the
combination of TMZ and MET significantly inhibits
glioma cells and GSCs proliferation, induce GSCs
apoptosis and therefore, combination treatment
significantly inhibits gliosphere formation and expansion.
This inhibitory effect was time- and dose-dependent.
Inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can reduce
apoptotic resistance in GBM [34]. Mechanistic studies
using Western blot analysis revealed that NVP-BEZ235
could significantly reduce the expression of Bcl-2 in GSCs
and activate Caspase-3 and Bax.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of
cells within a heterogeneous tumor. CSCs exhibit two
essential properties: the capacity for self-renewal and
the differentiation capacity [35]. It is generally agreed
that the tumorsphere-forming cells possess cancer stem
cell properties and are capable of self-renewal and
display higher tumorigenicity. Self-renewal is assessed
with in vitro tumorsphere formation assay, the sphere
formation ability is evaluated over serial passaging,
which is an indicator of long-term self-renewal [36]. In
the present study, the formation of secondary gliospheres
(a tumorsphere from GSCs) in control group indicated
that GSCs had obvious self-renewal capability. The selfrenewal capability of GSCs is assessed with secondary

that the combined treatment TMZ and MET significantly
inhibited the secondary gliosphere formation of GSCs,
suggesting that the combined treatment of two drugs
inhibits synergistically GSCs serial self-renewal capability
and reduces or partly eliminates GSCs.
Understanding the principal molecular mechanism
underlying the inhibitory activity of TMZ/MET is pivotal
to develop this combination as a novel therapy to decrease
the risk of GBM relapse. AMPK is a metabolic-sensing
protein kinase, which plays an critical role as an energy
sensor mainly in regulating growth and reprogramming
metabolism [38]. In the activated states, AMPK downregulates several anabolic enzymes and thus inhibits

cell growth [5]. Both TMZ and MET-induced GSCs
death and apoptosis in vitro through AMPK activation,
but the AMPK activation is not solely responsible for
the synergistic effect for the combination of TMZ with
MET. Although compound C-mediated suppression of
AMPK inhibits TMZ-induced GSC apoptosis and death,
but it’s incomplete and compound C has little effect on
MET-induced GSC death and apoptosis. In addition, after
AMPK activation was inhibited by compound C, the
combination of TMZ and MET still produced synergistic
GSCs apoptosis compared with single agent, and the
GSCs apoptosis rate without obvious falling compared
with TMZ and MET group. Base on these results, we
conclude that inhibition of AMPK activation suppresses

TMZ-induced GSC apoptosis and death, thus we speculate
that an increased in activity of AMPK enhances TMZinduced GSC death, but not MET, a similar result has also
been reported by Liu’s [39] group.
AKT is a major downstream target of growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinases that signal through PI3K. The
activity of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway has consistently
been linked to tumor cell resistance to antineoplastic
agents [12, 40, 41]. In the present study, our results
demonstrated that TMZ induced GSCs apoptosis via
activating AMPK, but AKT kinase activity was activated
at the same time. TMZ induced AKT activation, as well as
deactivated mTOR. It has proved that inhibition of AKT
expression was accompanied by a significant increased
in glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ [9, 13]. These results
strongly support the hypothesis that clinical benefits
are obtained by combining TMZ with inhibitors of the
AKT-mTOR pathway. AKT-mTOR pathway represents a
new target for the sensitization of GBM to TMZ. MET
effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in
GSCs, were associated with the inhibition of AKT-mTOR
axis. For the combination treatments, MET enhanced
the cytotoxicity of TMZ in GSCs, had a synergistic
effect. Western blot results showed that MET effectively
reversed the AKT activation induced by TMZ. Moreover,
the activities of mTOR, 4EBP1 and S6P were significantly
suppressed under their combination. To further explore
whether AKT-mTOR is involved in the synergistic effect
from the combination treatment. We knocked down
AKT-mTOR using NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K-mTOR
inhibitor. We demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous
AKT-mTOR function sensitizes GSCs to TMZ and MET,
addition of AKT-mTOR inhibitor such as NVPBEZ-235
promotes massive and rapid cell death. Here we speculate
that the synergy between AKT-mTOR inhibition and MET
may occur in other cancer.
Our in vitro study also demonstrated that TMZ in
combination with MET treatment significantly reduces
tumor growth rates and prolonged median survival of
tumor-bearing mice.
To conclude, MET synergistically enhances the
cytotoxicity of TMZ through down-regulation of the AKTmTOR signal pathway, independent AMPK. This synergy
was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. This combination
treatment could be a promising option for patients with
advanced GBM.

cells/sphere, within 10 days, gliospheres were dissociated
by Accutase (Sigma) and reseeded at a ratio of 1:2–3.

GSCs identification (Immunofluorescence
staining)
The secondary gliospheres were plated onto polyL-lysine (Sigma) coated glass cover slips in DMEM with
10% FBS for 8 hours. The Gliospheres were washed
with cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min
and blocked in 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Then the gliospheres were immunostained
with CD133 (1:100, ZSGB-BIO, China), nestin (1:40,
ZSGB-BIO, China), β-tubulin III (1:100, ZSGB-BIO,
China) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:100,
ZSGB-BIO, China) at 4°C overnight. Subsequent
visualization was performed with fluorochromeconjugated secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO, China) for

Western blotting

0.5 hours at room temperature in darkness, and the nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI.
For immunostaining of differentiated tumor cells,
gliospheres were tanslated to DMEM with 10% FBS for
another 7 days, immunocytochemistry was performed as
described above. The fluorescent signals were detected and
photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus
IX51, Japan).

GSCs were seeded in 100 mm dishes (Falcon)
and incubated for 24 hours prior to treatment. After
treatment, GSCs were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer,
and centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants
were collected, and the total protein concentration was
quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit.
Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg) were separated by
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane.
After blocking with 5% skim milk at room temperature
for 2 h, the membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies against rabbit anti-active caspase-3, rabbit antiBAX, rabbit anti-Bcl-2, rabbit antiphospho-AMPK, rabbit
anti-AMPK, rabbit antiphospho- acetyl CoA carboxylase
(ACC), rabbit anti-ACC, rabbit antiphospho-AKT,
rabbit anti-AKT, rabbit antiphospho-mTOR, rabbit antimTOR, rabbit antiphospho-4EBP1, rabbit anti-4EBP1,
rabbit antiphospho-p70S6K, rabbit anti-p70S6K (All of
the above antibodies were procured from Cell Signaling
Technology), equal lane loading was confirmed using a
monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The
membranes were washed three times with PBS-T (0.1%
(v/v) Triton-X100) buffer for 0.5 hours and incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hours.
After washing with the PBS-T buffer, the membranes
were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR).

Gliosphere formation and expansion assay
To test the effect of TMZ or/and MET on secondary
gliosphere formation, after primary spheres formation was
noted, the primary gliospheres were dissociated and plated
in 96-well plates (5 × 103 per ml per well) in NBM in
the absence or presence of TMZ, MET or TMZ + MET,
Cultures were fed 0.02 ml of NBM every 2 days and
photographed (× 200) after 7 days using IX51 Olympus
microscope.

Cell proliferation assays and synergy analysis
The cytotoxicity of TMZ or MET on glioma cells
was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.
Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 96well microplates at a density of 5 × 103 cells in 200 μl
media per well and incubated for 24 hours prior to
treatment, then different concentrations of TMZ or MET
were added and compared with the DMSO-treated control.
Twenty microliters of CCK-8 solution were added 4 hours
before the end of the incubation period, and the OD was
measured at 450nm after 72 hours using a Synergy HTX
Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, USA).
To determine the dose-effect of combination
therapy (TMZ plus MET) at 48 hours of treatment, the
Chou-Talalay method and CalcuSyn software (version 2,
Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) were used [42]. For this synergy
analysis, TMZ was combined with MET at a constant
ratio for glioma cells and GSCs at a dosage determined
by the IC50 of each drug. Interaction was quantified based
on a combination index (CI) to assess synergism (CI < 1),
additive effect (CI = 1), and antagonism (CI > 1).

Human tumor xenografts in severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice
To test the anti-glioma effect of TMZ alone or in
combination with MET in vivo, a xenograft model of
human glioma was established. 4-week old male SCID
mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). After 1 week
acclimatization, each mouse was injected subcutaneously
in the right flank with 1 × 106 U87 GSCs resuspended
in 50 μl NBM media. After about 3 weeks, when the
subcutaneous tumors reached an average size of 150 to
200 mm3, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (five
mice per group) and treatment was started. Mice received
TMZ alone (25 mg/kg/day, for a 21-day continuum,
intraperitoneal injection) or MET alone (400 mg/kg/day,
for a 21-day continuum, by gavage) or TMZ and MET in
combination or vehicle as control. Tumor diameter was
measured every 2–3 days with calipers, and the tumor
volume was calculated (length × width × width × 0.5).
The survival time of the mice was recorded and the
median survivals were calculated. All animal procedures
were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, First
Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China. All
surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital
anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize
suffering.

Apoptosis assays
The apoptosis cells were quantified (percentage)
using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/
propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (BD).
Briefly, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded
at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After
treatment, cells were harvested using Accutase detachment
solution and Annexin-V-FITC/PI labeling was performed
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The stained
cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer. The numbers of
viable (annexin V−/PI-), apoptotic (annexin V+/PI-), and
necrotic (annexin V+/PI+) cells were calculated with the
FACSDiva Version 6.2.
