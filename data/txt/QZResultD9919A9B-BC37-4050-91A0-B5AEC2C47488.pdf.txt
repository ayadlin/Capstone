ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy is the major choice for the cancer treatment of early and advanced
stages. However, intrinsic or acquired drug resistance significantly restricts the clinical
efficacy of chemotherapy. It is critical to develop novel approaches to detect and
overcome drug resistance. In this study, we demonstrated that accelerated glycolysis
played a pivotal role in both intrinsic and acquired cisplatin-resistance of gastric cancer
cells. The metabolic reprogramming of cisplatin-resistant cells was characterized by
increased glycolysis dependence. Inhibition of glycolysis with glucose starvation
or 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) treatment significantly reversed drug resistance. By
proteomic screening, we found the increased expression of the glycolytic enzyme
Enolase 1 (ENO1) in cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells. Depletion of ENO1 by
siRNA significantly reduced glycolysis and reversed drug resistance. Moreover, the
increased expression of ENO1 was attributed to the down-regulation of ENO1-targeting
miR-22, rather than activated gene transcriptional or prolonged protein stability.
Finally, the elevated levels of ENO1 proteins were associated with the shorter overall
survival of gastric cancer patients. In conclusion, ENO1 is a novel biomarker to predict
drug resistance and overall prognosis in gastric cancer. Targeting ENO1 by chemical
inhibitors or up-regulating miR-22 could be valuable to overcome drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Multiple mechanisms participate in DDP resistance,
including increased drug efflux, drug inactivation,
enhanced DNA damage repair, active survival signaling
pathway and evasion of apoptosis [2]. Recently,
the relevance of metabolic reprogramming to drug
resistance received much attention [3, 4]. As one of
major hallmarks of cancer cells, accelerated aerobic
glycolysis contributes to DDP resistance in various
cancers such as cervical cancer and lung cancer [5–11].
Although aerobic glycolysis produces less ATP per
molecule of glucose than oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), it can confer many selective advantages. For

Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers
worldwide, especially in East Asia [1]. Chemotherapy
in the form of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy is the
dominant treatment for most of the gastric cancers.
Despite of the rapid development of new therapeutic drugs
such as target therapy drugs, cisplatin (DDP) remains
one of the most important drugs used in the treatment
of gastric cancer. Unfortunately, drug resistance poses a
major challenge to benefit gastric cancer patients from
DDP-based chemotherapy.

example, the ATP generation rate of glycolysis is almost
100 times faster than that of OXPHOS. By consuming
more glucose, sufficient ATP could be produced rapidly
from glycolysis [12]. In addition, intermediate products
during glycolysis can be used as materials for the
biosynthesis of macromolecules indispensable for cancer
proliferation and growth, like nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), lipids and nucleic
acids. Moreover, NADPH is instrumental to maintain
sufficient levels of reduced forms of glutathione (GSH) to
antagonize oxidative stress produced by DDP. Meanwhile,
glycolysis can also enable cancer cells to reduce ROS
generation by limiting the pyruvate flux into mitochondrial
respiration, and thus acquire resistance to apoptosis or
even promote metastasis [13–15].
To explore the mechanism of drug resistance
in gastric cancers, we employed BGC823/DDP with
acquired resistance and MGC803 intrinsically resistant to
cisplatin [16]. We showed that increased glucose uptake
and enhanced aerobic glycolysis occurred in gastric
cancer cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance to DDP.
Inhibition of glycolysis suppressed cell proliferation
and reversed drug resistance. The enhanced glycolysis
in drug resistance was caused by increased ENO1
expression resulted from the downregulation of miR-22.
Overexpression of ENO1 or down-regulation of miR-22
enhanced glycolysis and promoted cisplatin-resistance.
Meanwhile, depletion of ENO1 or up-regulation of
miR-22 repressed glycolysis and restored cisplatin
sensitivity. Therefore, targeting ENO1 or up-regulating
miR-22 could be valuable to overcome drug resistance.

Inhibition of glycolysis reversed cisplatin
resistance

RESULTS

Cisplatin-resistant cells up-regulated ENO1 to
enhance glycolysis

Glycolysis provided metabolic products and energy
for cell survival. To clarify the relevance of enhanced
glycolysis to drug resistance, we applied glucose
deprivation or 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), the analogue
of glucose as a competitive glycolytic inhibitor. Firstly,
we found that BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells were
more sensitive to glucose deprivation than BGC823 cells
(Figure 2A and 2B). Similarly, they were more sensitive
to 2-DG treatment (Figure 2C and 2D). These results
indicated that chemo-resistant cells were dependent more
on glycolysis for survival.
Next, we investigated the effect of glycolysis inhibition
on cisplatin resistance. We found that glucose deprivation
markedly reversed cisplatin resistance in both BGC823/
DDP and MGC803 cells (Figure 2E and 2G). Furthermore,
2-DG treatment also increased sensitivity to cisplatin in
BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells (Figure 2F and 2H).
Both cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1 proteins were
increased in glucose deprived or 2-DG-treated BGC823/
DDP cells after cisplatin use (Figure 3A and 3B). Similarly,
glucose deprivation or 2-DG treatment enhanced cisplatininduced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP1 in MGC803 cells
(Figure 3C and 3D). The Annexin V/PI detection showed
that apoptotic cells were apparently increased induced by
cisplatin in glucose deprived or 2-DG treatment of BGC823/
DDP and MGC803 cells (Figure 3E and 3F). In summary,
inhibition of enhanced glycolysis could reverse cisplatin
resistance.

Glycolysis was enhanced in cisplatin resistant
gastric cancer cells

To identify potential mechanisms underlying
enhanced glycolysis and chemoresistance, we employed
two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with
MALDI-TOF MS to discover the proteomic differences
between BGC823 and BGC823/DDP cells [16]. Among
40 identified differential spots, ENO1 was detected in
BGC823/DDP cells but not in BGC823 cells (Figure 4A).
Western blotting analysis further confirmed that ENO1
was significantly overexpressed in BGC823/DDP and
MGC803 cells compared with BGC823 cells (Figure 4B).
Since ENO1 was a key enzyme in glycolysis to catalyze
2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (Figure 4C),
we wondered whether it was relevant to enhanced
glycolysis and chemoresistance.
First, we compared changes in glycolysis in
BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells before and after ENO1
knockdown. After transient silencing of ENO1, the glucose
consumption was decreased, especially in BGC823/DDP
cells (Figure 4D). Consistently, the production of pyruvic

To explore molecular mechanisms responsible for
drug resistance in gastric cancer, we employed BGC823/
DDP with acquired resistance and MGC803 intrinsically
resistant to cisplatin [16]. As shown in Figure 1A, there
were more survived BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells
when compared with BGC823 cells upon treatment with
0.8 μg/ml of cisplatin. Since nutrient or energy metabolism
has been reported to contribute to drug resistance [17–19],
we compared glucose consumption in these cells. Both
BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells consumed more glucose
than BGC823 cells (Figure 1B and 1C). Consistent
with increased glucose consumption, there were more
glycolysis metabolic products such as pyruvic acid and
lactic acid produced in BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells
than BGC823 cells (Figure 1D, 1E, 1F and 1G). Taken
together, these data demonstrated that the glycolysis was
enhanced in cisplatin resistant gastric cancer cells.

acid, lactic acid and ATP were significantly decreased after
ENO1 knockdown (Figure 4E, 4F and 4G). In conclusion,
the increased ENO1 expression enhanced glycolysis in
drug-resistant gastric cancer cells.

cisplatin treatment (Figure 6A and 6B). Consistently, the
consumption of glucose and the production of pyruvic acid
and lactic acid were significantly increased (Figure 6C),
indicating that ENO1 induced cisplatin-resistance by
promoting glycolysis.

ENO1 knockdown increased sensitivity to
cisplatin

MicroRNA-22 targeted ENO1 mRNA

Then we investigated the impact of ENO1 on
cisplatin resistance. Upon ENO1 knockdown, cisplatin
sensitivities in BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells were
significantly increased (Figure 5A and 5B). Such increases
in drug sensitivities were accompanied with the activation
of cell apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V and PI
staining (Figure 5C and 5D) as well as increased cleavage
of caspase-3 and PARP1 by Western blot (Figure 5E
and  5F). The ENO1 knockdown efficiency was shown
by QPCR (Figure 5G). In summary, these data suggested
that the increased expression of key glycolysis catalytic
enzyme ENO1 contributed to cisplatin resistance.

To clarify the regulation of ENO1 in cisplatinresistant cells, we determined the mRNA level of ENO1.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed slightly decreased
level of mRNA in resistant cells (Figure 7A). In addition,
there were no changes in the protein half-lives of ENO1
in BGC823 and BGC823/DDP cells (Figure 7B),
indicating that the increased expression of ENO1 in drug
resistance was not attributed to the enhanced transcription
of ENO1 gene or prolonged stability of ENO1 protein.
Therefore, we hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNA)
might be involved in the regulation of ENO1. Based on
on-line prediction (www.microRNA.org), we chose the
highly-conserved microRNA with the highest mirSVR
score, miR-22, for further investigations. Indeed,
miR-22 was down-regulated in both resistant cells
(Figure 7C). Moreover, miR-22 mimics reduced ENO1
protein expression in BGC823/DDP and MGC803 cells
(Figure 7D), while miR-22 inhibitor significantly upregulated ENO1 in BGC823 cells (Figure 7D). The
3′-UTR of the ENO1 mRNA with a complementary
binding site for miR-22 was cloned into the luciferase

Overexpression of ENO1 in cisplatin-sensitive
cells induced cisplatin-resistance by glycolysis
promotion
Then we explored the influence of ENO1 on cisplatinsensitive gastric cells. Once ENO1 was overexpressed
in BGC823 cells, the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP1
were decreased and less viability inhibition occurred after

vector (Figure 7E, left panel). And then we constructed a
mutant plasmid which contained point mutations within
the miR-22 binding site. Importantly, miR-22 mimics
markedly repressed the luciferase reporter activity driven
by the wild-type ENO1 3’-UTR while the luciferase
expression of mutant plasmid was not affected by
miR-22 mimics (Figure 7E, right panel), indicating that
ENO1 was a bona fide target of miR-22. Then we analyzed

the influence of miR-22 on glycolysis. The consumption of
glucose as well as the production of pyruvic acid and lactic
acid were increased in BGC823 cells after transfection of
miR-22 inhibitor (Figure 7F). In contrast, consumption
of glucose and the production of pyruvic acid and lactic
acid were reduced by miR-22 mimic in BGC823/DDP
cells. Taken together, these results suggested that miR-22
was responsible for the overexpression of ENO1 protein

and glycolysis enhancement in drug-resistant gastric
cancer cells.

But its expression levels were not significantly associated
with TNM stage and differentiation (Chi-square test,
p > 0.05). Moreover, high expression of ENO1 had a
strong association with shorter overall survival (OS) (Low
ENO1 expression: 2532 days, 95% CI: 1861–3203; High
ENO1 expression: 1931 days, 95% CI: 1406–2457, LogRank test, p < 0.05, Figure 8C). Univariate Cox regression
analysis revealed that high ENO1 expression significantly
increased two folds of death hazard (p < 0.05, Table 2).
When other potential prognosis factors such as TNM
stage, differentiation and gender were incorporated in the
multivariate Cox regression, high ENO1 expression also
displayed the trend to indicate shorter survival (p=0.07,
Figure 8D and Table 2). In contrast, ENO1 expression
had no influence on progression free survival (PFS) (Low
ENO1 expression: 788 days, 95% CI: 520–1056; High
ENO1 expression: 780 days, 95% CI: 318–1242, LogRank test, p > 0.05 and Table 3).

ENO1 predicted a poor clinical outcome in
gastric cancer
We next explored the clinical relevance of ENO1
in gastric cancer patients. ENO1 expression in primary
gastric adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining. As shown
in Figure 8A and 8B, ENO1 expression was increased in
tumor tissues (high expression rate: 13% in non-tumor
tissues and 69% in tumor tissues). The association of
ENO1 expression levels with various clinicopathologic
characteristics in gastric cancer patients was summarized
in Table 1. Interestingly, ENO1 protein was highly
expressed in male patients (high expression rate: 85%
in male and 58% in female, Chi-square test, p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

transporters and activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR to inhibit
apoptosis and facilitate cellular survival [3, 26]. Elevated
lactate levels can reinforce DNA repair and promote
cisplatin resistance in cervical carcinoma cells via the
inactivation of histone deacetylase [27]. In addition,
pyruvate can promote chemoresistance by up-regulating
the expression of p-glycoprotein to enhance the efflux
of chemotherapeutic drugs [28]. ATP was considered as
a pivotal determinant in maintaining MDR phenotype
partially because elevated ATP levels directly activated
transporters with ATP-binding cassettes to exclude
intracellular cytotoxic drugs [29]. As a result, depletion
of ATP could eventually reverse chemoresistance [4, 8].
In this study, we found enhanced glycolysis in
both intrinsic and acquired cisplatin-resistant gastric
cancer cells. Both glucose consumption and lactate

As one of hallmarks of human cancer cells, elevated
uptake of glucose and accelerated glycolytic rates were
first observed by Germany Biochemist Dr. Otto Heinrich
Warburg and later confirmed by many studies [7, 20, 21].
Anti-cancer treatments like radiation and
chemotherapy can induce free radicals to kill cancer cells.
Therefore, enhanced glycolysis may contribute to drug
resistance by increasing reducing capacity [8–10, 19, 22].
In addition, the intracellular microenvironment affected
by elevated glycolysis can turn to be lower glucose
concentration with high levels of lactate, pyruvate and
ATP, thus facilitating the development of multiple drug
resistance (MDR) [23–25]. The low glucose concentration
in microenvironment increases the expression of glucose

production were increased in gastric cancer cells resistant
to the well-used chemotherapeutic drug. Inhibition of
glycolysis not only inhibited cell proliferation but also
reversed resistance to cisplatin. Therefore, gastric cancer
cells with drug resistance also developed dependence
on enhanced glycolysis for cellular survival. There are
many mechanisms proposed to contribute to the Warburg
effect. For example, aberrant activation of oncogenic
signaling pathways including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/
mTOR or loss of function of cancer suppressor genes
like p53 which could promote the expression of glucose
transporters and glycolytic enzymes [30–32]. Meanwhile,
the metabolic products such as lactate can in turn
promote glycolysis as a positive feedback [33]. Here, we
identified another rate-limiting enzyme overexpression in
both acquired and intrinsic drug-resistant gastric cancer
cells by proteomic screening. ENO1 protein, which
catalyzes 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate,
was significantly overexpressed in BGC823/DDP and
MGC803 cells.

In mammals, enolase has three isoforms, that is
alpha-enolase, beta-enolase and gamma-enolase, encoded
by three distinct genes [34]. Alpha-enolase (ENO1) is an
essential glycolytic enzyme detected in nearly all adult
human tissues. It has been reported that ENO1 was upregulated in various human cancers including gastric
cancer [35, 36], glioma [37], breast cancer [38], lung
cancer [39], head and neck cancer [40], endometrial
carcinoma [41], pancreatic adenocarcinoma [42, 43], and
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHLs) [44]. Our results
further confirmed these findings. ENO1 protein was highly
expressed in tumor tissues in comparison with adjacent
non-tumor tissues including gastric tissues with dysplasia
(Figure 8 and data not shown). Interestingly, we also
found that ENO1 expression was further increased in both
acquired and intrinsic drug resistance. Depletion of ENO1
inhibited glycolysis and reversed drug resistance.
So far, glycolytic enzymes also have been reported
in promoting drug resistance by other mechanisms in
addition of activating metabolic flux [45–48]. For instance,

hexokinase (HK), one of the rate-limiting enzymes in
glycolysis, can locate to mitochondrial outer membrane
and inhibit mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [49, 50].
Similarly, ENO1 can also locate in nucleus to inhibit the
transcription of c-myc, a proto-oncogene, which acts as
a negative transcription factor [51]. However, we failed
to detect the enhanced nuclear location of ENO1 in
either BGC823/DDP or MGC803 cells (date not shown).
Therefore, the stimulation of drug resistance by increased
ENO1 expression in gastric cancer was most likely
attributed to its enzyme activity to regulate glycolysis
rather than its function as a transcription regulator.

glucose consumption, and the production of lactate,
pyruvate and ATP, thus reversing drug resistance. How
inhibition of glycolysis reversed drug resistance remains to
be clarified. However, it has been reported that inhibition
of ENO1 could induce autophagy to arrest cellular growth
[52]. In addition, many metabolites including pyruvate
were able to reprogram gene expression in an epigenetic
manner [53]. Therefore, the understanding of differential
gene expression before and after ENO1 depletion by high
throughput methods would be valuable to understand the
regulation of drug resistance by glycolysis.
Studies have revealed that high level of ENO1
was strongly linked to poor prognosis of cancer patients

[35, 37, 38, 44]. Consistently, we indeed found that high
ENO1 expression predicted shorter overall survival of
gastric cancers. Therefore, ENO1 was proposed to be
a potential tumor biomarker of chemoresistance and
overall prognosis [39, 41, 43]. Certainly, its clinical value
warrants further validations with a larger cohort.
The increased expression of ENO1 in some cancers
was resulted from high mRNA levels. Actually, ENO1
is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1α [19, 54, 55].
However, to our surprise, mRNA of ENO1 were even
slightly decreased in MGC803 and BGC823/DDP cells.
Interestingly, high level of ENO1 protein with low
ENO1 mRNA level was also detected in methotrexateresistant breast cancer cells [56]. We indeed found that
the discrepancy between protein and mRNA of ENO1
was attributed to the downregulation of ENO1-tagreting
miR-22, but not the post-translational regulation of its
protein stability. Interestingly, miR-22 played different
roles in tumorigenesis depending on caner types
[57–60]. However, miR-22 seemed to serve as a novel
tumor suppressor in gastric cancers. MiR-22 expression
was significantly reduced in gastric cancer tissues when
compared with normal adjacent mucosa, and the reduced
expression of miR-22 indicated shorter overall survival
for patients [61]. Overexpression of miR-22 could
inhibit gastric cancer growth [62–64]. These data were
consistent with our findings, and we further discovered
that low expression of miR-22 promoted glycolysis
and cisplatin-resistance by up-regulating ENO1. It
remains unclear how miR-22 expression was reduced
in gastric cancers. Interestingly, STAT5 could downregulate miR-22 expression by binding the promoter
of its host gene. Inhibition of Jak3, STAT3 and STAT5
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

triggered overexpression of miR-22 and suppressed
cancer proliferation in cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma [65].
Therefore, miR-22 could be valuable to target ENO1 to
overcome drug resistance in gastric cancers.
In conclusion, gastric cancers could develop a
cisplatin-resistant phenotype by glycolysis acceleration
and dependence. Glucose deprivation or glycolysis
inhibition can sensitize cells to chemotherapy. ENO1
serves as a master regulator of tumor glycolysis and
predicts an unfavorable prognosis for gastric cancers.
MiR-22 targets 3′-UTR of ENO1 to repress its expression
and reduced expression of miR-22 eventually promote
ENO1 expression to enhance glycolysis and drug
resistance. Therefore, inhibition of ENO1 or up-regulation
of miR-22 could restrain glycolysis to increase cisplatin
sensitivity.

proteins were probed with the indicated primary antibodies
followed by incubation in HRP-conjugated corresponding
secondary antibodies and revealed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

3′-UTR segment of the ENO1 with wild or mutant
miR-22 binding sites were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) for sequence
validation. The correct insert was again cloned into the
pMIR-Luciferase-REPORTER vectors. The restriction
enzymes were Sac I and Hind III. The primers used
were shown in Table 4. The resultant plasmids were cotransfected with miR-22 mimics by using lipofectamine
RNAiMax. After 48 h transfection, the luciferase activities
were measured by the Dual-GLO Luciferase Assay System
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).

Glucose consumption
Cells were plated in the six-well plates, after
24 h the culture media were replaced by 3 ml fresh media
with different treatments. Then after certain period, the
supernatant were collected and glucose concentrations
were measured by Abbott ArchitectC16000 (Abbott
Park, North Chicago, Illinois, USA). The cells left were
trypsinized and counted for three times. The glucose
consumption levels were standardized to μmol/106
cells. The fold changes were normalized by BGC823
consumption.

Cell viability assay
Cells viability was determined by Cell Titer
96®AQueous Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay)
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). 0.8 × 104
BGC823 cells and BGC823/DDP cells or 0.6 × 104
MGC803 cells were seeded per well in the 96-well plates.
After 24 h, cells were subjected to different concentrations
of 2-DG (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM and 8 mM) or
glucose (0%, 12.5%, 25% and 100%) for 48 h with or
without DDP. The conditioned glucose media were mixed
by RPMI 1640 complete medium (11 mM glucose) and
RPMI 1640 glucose-free medium according to proportion
of 0%, 12.5%, 25% and 100%. BGC823/DDP was treated
with 4 μg/ml, 8 μg/ml, 12 μg/ml and 16 μg/ml DDP while
MGC803 with 0.5 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml, 2 μg/ml and 4 μg/ml
DDP respectively for 24 h.

Lactic acid and pyruvic acid measurement
The supernatant of cells were collected after
treatment and lactic acid and pyruvic acid were measured
by colorimetric method following the manufacturer’s
instructions of Lactic Acid assay kit and Pyruvate assay
kit (Nanjing Jiancheng bioengneering institute, Nanjing,
China). The cell numbers were counted for three times,
and finally, the acid production were the measured by
μmol/106 cells.

Intracellular ATP measurement
Briefly, cells were seeded for 24 h and then replaced
by fresh media with different treatments. After cultivation,
media were removed, cells lysates were measured using
luciferase-based ATP Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China) by following the assay instructions for intracellular
ATP levels. The unit of measurement was nmol/106 cells.

Flow cytometry analysis
3 × 105 BGC823/DDP and 2 × 105 MGC803 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates, and the next day changed for
2-DG (2.5 mM for BGC823/DDP and 1 mM for MGC803)
or hypoglycemic media (12.5% glucose for BGC823/DDP
and 25% glucose for MGC803) for 60 h, until the last
36 h, BGC823/DDP cells were added with 8 μg/ml DDP
and MGC803 with 2.5 μg/ml DDP respectively. Apoptotic
cell death was determined by using the FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells
were washed twice with cold PBS and then suspended at
a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 1 × Binding Buffer.
Then 100 μl cellular suspensions were added with 5 μl
of FITC Annexin V and 5 μl PI, and then incubated for
15 min at room temperature in darkness before analyzed
by flow cytometry.

Immunohistochemical staining
The paraffin sections were prepared from gastric
tissue biochips, containing normal, precancerosis and
tumors. The indirect streptavidinperoxidase method
was used for detecting protein ENO1 expression level
according to manufacturer’s introduction. The antibody
was rabbit anti-ENO1 antibody (1:1000, Proteintech,
Rosemont, PA, USA). The stained specimens were
evaluated separately by two pathologists. The scores
were based on expression intensity and its proportion,
and finally divided into four groups, none (0), weak (1),
medium (2) and strong (3). Score 0-1 was defined as low
expression while Score 2–3 as high.
