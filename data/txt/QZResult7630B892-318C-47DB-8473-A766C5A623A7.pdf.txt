BACKGROUND: This phase 1-2 trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of an oral angiogenesis inhibitor—PTK787/
ZK222584 (PTK)—in combination with intravenous doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. METHODS: In phase 1, advanced HCC patients received PTK at escalating doses together with
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 given as an intravenous bolus every 3 weeks to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Subsequently, in phase 2, all patients received the same regimen with oral PTK at the MTD dose every 3 weeks for a
maximum of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Nine patients were recruited in phase 1, with the MTD established as 750 mg daily.
Overall, 27 patients received the regimen with PTK at 750 mg daily. The median age was 52 years (range, 23-73
years), and 63 percent of patients were chronic hepatitis B carriers. Notably, the majority of patients had Child-Pugh
B cirrhosis. The overall response rate was 26.0%, with all the responding patients having partial response. Another
20% of patients achieved stable disease for at least 12 weeks. The median progression-free survival was 5.4 months
(range, 0.27-23.6 months), and overall survival was 7.3 months (range, 0.8-23.6 months). The commonest grade 3 or
4 nonhematological toxicities were mucositis (11%) and alopecia (7%), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was
observed in 7 (26%) patients; 2 had neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PTK with intravenous

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.1 Surgical resection and liver
transplantation of HCC are the main curative treatments, but these operations are only applicable to patients with localized HCC.2,3 Whereas the long-term survival of patients with early HCC amenable to surgical treatment has improved in
recent years, the prognosis of patients with advanced HCC remains poor. Systemic chemotherapy has not been shown to
improve patient survival thus far.4 Doxorubicin is among the most commonly used chemotherapies for HCC,5 with a single-agent tumor response rate of 0% to 15% in most reports.6,7
HCC is a highly vascular tumor with a high propensity for vascular invasion and is closely associated with active neovascularization.8,9 Thus, tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in the development and progression of HCC. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential for tumor growth throughout the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.10 Its
overexpression varies from 37% to 100% in HCC cells, and aberrant VEGF expression is a prominent feature in HCC.11
PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK) is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor and exerts its effect via antiangiogenic pathways.12 It is a
potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, it also has an inhibitory effect
on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor kinase and c-kit protein tyrosine kinase.13

PTK787 and Doxorubicin for HCC/Yau et al

In the present study, we aimed to assess the efficacy
and tolerability of PTK in combination with intravenous
doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced HCC patients.
However, in view of the finding that most HCC patients
have underlying cirrhosis with suboptimal liver function,
the tolerance of this combination in this patient population is unknown. Thus, we started with a phase 1 trial and
then progressed to a phase 2 trial after obtaining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a single-center, prospective, single-arm, phase 12 study of PTK combined with intravenous doxorubicin
in subjects with advanced HCC not suitable for either surgical or locoregional therapy. The protocol was approved
by the local ethic committee and written consent was
obtained from the patients before enrollment.
Patient Eligibility
Advanced HCC patients who were not suitable for surgery
or various locoregional therapies at the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong were enrolled. HCC was diagnosed either
by cytohistological confirmation or by noninvasive criteria
according to European Association for the Study of the
Liver criteria: cirrhotic patients either with focal lesion >2
cm with arterial hypervascularization demonstrated by 2
coincident imaging techniques or with focal lesion >2 cm
with arterial hypervascularization demonstrated by 1 imaging technique and associated with alpha fetoprotein (AFP)
level >400 ng/mL.14 Staging was by both American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and Cancer of the Liver
Italian Program score. The eligibility criteria included adult
patients aged 18 to 75 years, patients with Child-Pugh class
A or B cirrhosis, Karnofsky performance status 70%,
expected life expectancy of 12 weeks and with adequate
organ function, and complete blood picture (absolute neutrophil count >1.5  109/L, platelet count >100  109/L)
and biochemistry (total bilirubin of 2  upper limit of
normal, serum creatinine 2  upper limit of normal, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 5  upper limit of normal). Moreover, the disease
must be measurable with at least 1 lesion, which was at least
1 cm in 1 dimension either on computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
Treatment Design
Dosing, dose escalation, and modification

In the phase 1 part, 3 dose levels were tested, with 3
patients enrolled in each dose level as follows: level 1,

PTK 1000 mg daily þ doxorubicin 60 mg/m2; Level 3,
PTK 1250 mg daily þ doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. All
patients received oral PTK together with doxorubicin
60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. The
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 4
toxicities, grade 3 neutropenia, the occurrence of neutropenic sepsis, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or any grade 3
toxicities that did not return back to grade 1-2 within 3
weeks except alopecia. If none of the first 3 patients
developed DLT, the dose would be escalated to the next
level. If 1 or more of the 3 patients developed DLT,
another 3 patients would be added to that dose level. If 2
or more of the 6 patients experienced DLT, that dose
level was considered intolerable, and the maximum tolerated dose was fixed at the next lower dose level. Dose
modifications were required for drug-related toxicities.
The dose of doxorubicin was modified based on the
nadirs according to the guideline shown in Table 1. Subsequently, in phase 2, all patients received oral PTK at
MTD together with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 given as an
intravenous bolus every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6
cycles.
Disease evaluation

A full history and complete physical examination
including performance status were performed at every
clinical visit. Disease assessment was performed mainly by
CT scan around every 3 cycles, that is, every 9 weeks.
MRI and positron emission tomography with 11C-acetate
as radioisotope were performed in case of uncertainty of
response. Response was determined by independent radiologists and classified according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.15

Safety Monitoring
Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording
all the adverse events and serious adverse events throughout the study period. Apart from monitoring of vital signs,
regular collection of urine, hematology, and blood chemistry of the enrolled subjects were performed. All patients
who received at least 1 cycle of treatment were considered
evaluable for safety. Toxicity was evaluated according to
National Cancer Institute criteria.16
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of the phase 1 study was the MTD
of PTK when combined with intravenous doxorubicin in
treating advanced HCC patients. In phase 2, the primary
endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included the objective tumor response
rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, disease
control rate was defined as the percentage of patients who
had either radiological response or stable disease (SD).
Statistical Analysis
Survival analysis was computed by the Kaplan-Meier
method. PFS was calculated from the date of commencement of study drugs to the date of documented progression or death. OS was calculated from the date of
commencement of study drugs to the date of death or last
follow-up. The analysis was performed on an intent-totreat basis.
The main purpose of the phase 1 study was to find
MTD with dose escalation. A minimum of 3 patients and
a maximum of 6 patients at each dose level (3 dose levels)
were recruited depending on the occurrence of DLT. In
the phase 2 part, Simon’s 2-stage optimal design was used
for sample size estimation. In the first stage, 14 patients
were enrolled. If 2 of the 14 patients responded to the
treatment, accrual would be stopped, and the regimen was
considered probably not worthwhile for further development in this patient population. If 3 patients responded,
then additional patients would be enrolled to provide a
sufficient number of patients to evaluate safety and efficacy of the regimen. All statistical analysis was performed
by Statistical Package for Social Science version 13.0 for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Phase 1
Between October 2005 and June 2006, 9 patients were
enrolled into the phase 1 part. At a PTK dose level of 750

5024

mg daily, initially 3 patients were recruited, but 1 patient
developed DLT (neutropenic fever). Thus, an additional
3 patients were recruited, and no DLT was observed at the
dose level of 750 mg daily. The dose was escalated to
1000 mg with 3 patients recruited. DLT occurred in all 3
recruited patients. Two patients developed grade 4 neutropenia as DLT, whereas 1 patient had grade 4 mucositis
as DLT. Therefore, the MTD was defined as 750 mg
daily. An additional 21 patients were recruited in phase 2
using this MTD of PTK. The results of the 27 patients
who received PTK at the dose of 750 mg daily together
with intravenous doxorubicin are analyzed below.
Patient Demographics
Twenty-seven patients had received PTK 750 mg daily together with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 for the treatment of
advanced HCC. Table 2 shows the demographic data of
these patients. The median age was 52 years (range, 23-73
years), and the majority were men. All the enrolled
patients had good performance status. Seventeen (63%)
patients were chronic hepatitis B carriers, and 2 (9.1%)
patients were chronic hepatitis C carriers. Notably, only 2
(7.4%) patients had underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis,
and of the remaining patients, 25 (92.6%) had ChildPugh B cirrhosis. Twenty-one Child-Pugh B patients had
a score of 7; only 4 patients had a score of 8. Nineteen
(70.4%) patients had stage 4 disease according to the
AJCC staging system, whereas 3 (11.1%) and 5 (18.5%)
patients had stage IIIC and stage IIIA disease, respectively.
The commonest site of metastases was lung (63%), and
portal vein tumor thrombosis was presented in 4 (14.8%)
patients. More than half of the patients had received liver
resection for HCC, and about one-third of the patients
had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
for advanced HCC. Moreover, 6 patients had radiofrequency ablation, and only 1 patient had received alcohol
injection for HCC. Notably, none of the enrolled patients
had received any prior systemic therapy or radiotherapy
for the treatment of advanced HCC.
Treatment Efficacy and Survival Analysis
Overall, the median number of cycles of PTK at 750 mg
with intravenous doxorubicin was 5 (range, 1-6). Disease
assessments could not be done in 4 patients, as they discontinued the study early for the following reasons: 2
patients died of a hemorrhagic complication after 1 course
of treatment, and the other 2 patients discontinued early
because of treatment-related toxicities. The overall RR
with the remaining 23 evaluable patients was 26.0%.

Treatment-Related Toxicities
All patients were assessed for toxicities. Table 3 shows the
details of treatment-related toxicities in the enrolled
patients. Regarding nonhematological toxicities, nausea
(67%) was the most commonly encountered toxicity, followed by alopecia (59.3%) and diarrhea (40.7%). The
most common grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicities
were mucositis (11%) and alopecia (7%). Hypertension
occurred in 6 (22.2%) patients, although the majority of
the patients had only grade 1 or 2 toxicity. Of note, 2
patients had developed hemorrhagic complications after
receiving only 1 course of the combination treatment; 1
patient died of uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding,
and the other died of cerebellar hemorrhage. Ten patients
had developed neutropenia; 70% of these patients had
grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Overall, neutropenic sepsis was
reported in 2 patients. Ten (37%) patients required dose
reduction of doxorubicin according to the schedule
depicted in Table 1. Seven patients required dose reduction because of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and the other 3
patients because of grade 3 mucositis.

DISCUSSION
Advanced HCC is a relatively chemoresistant tumor and
is highly refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Singleagent doxorubicin alone has been shown to produce an
RR of about 0% to 15%, but with no proven survival benefit.17 More recently, a randomized phase 2 study showed
encouraging survival results in combining sorafenib with
doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced HCC
patients.18 In patients had doxorubicin alone, the median
PFS and OS were 2.8 and 6.5 months, respectively. In
contrast, the median PFS (6.9 months) and OS (13.7
months) were doubled in patients receiving the combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin. Despite these promising survival results, doxorubicin either as a single agent or
in combination of sorafenib had a low overall response

promise in combining a targeted agent together with
chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced HCC
patients. Similar to the sorafenib and doxorubicin combination study, we report the results of our phase 1-2 trial in
assessing the efficacy and tolerability of another targeted
therapy—PTK in combination with intravenous doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced HCC. The overall

disease control rate was 47.7%, with 26.0% of patients
achieving PR for at least 12 weeks. Moreover, the median
PFS and OS were 5.4 months and 7.3 months, respectively. Thus, the current results demonstrate encouraging
preliminary activity in using PTK and intravenous doxorubicin combination in the management of advanced
HCC. Interestingly, when PTK was combined with
chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer (MCRC), there was no survival benefit when

compared with chemotherapy alone.19,20 This may be
attributed to the finding that angiogenesis plays a more
important role in the pathogenesis of HCC than MCRC.
Angiogenesis is a complex, multistep process initiated by the release of angiogenic factors from tumor cells.
Angiogenic factors, such as VEGF,9 PDGF,21 basic fibroblast growth factor,22 angiopoietins,23 and heparanase,10
released from both the tumor cells and the surrounding
stromal cells, participate in the neovascularization of
HCC. In analogue to PTK, bevacizumab is another main
antiangiogenic agent. Bevacizumab binds VEGF with
high affinity,24 thereby inhibiting tumor growth, peregrine/anticrime growth factor release, and metastasis.25
Moreover, it may enhance chemotherapeutic agent delivery to the tumor by normalizing tumor vasculature,26
decreasing the elevated interstitial pressure in the tumor,
and increasing vascular permeability.25 Bevacizumab as a
single agent or in combination with other agents has
shown initial encouraging activity in treating advanced
HCC. In the study conducted by Siegel et al., among 46
enrolled patients with locally advanced HCC, singleagent bevacizumab achieved a 13% RR, 65% of patients
were progression-free at 6 months,27 and the median time
to tumor progression was 6.9 months. Moreover, a phase
2 study conducted by Thomas et al.28 showed promising
activity of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib for
the treatment of advanced HCC. In this nonrandomized
phase 2 study, the combination showed 25% PR and
37.5% SD. The PFS and OS were 9 months and 15.7
months, respectively. All of the above studies support the
notion that the antiangiogenic approach is promising in
the management of advanced HCC.

Recently, 2 phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled
trials in the West29 and Asia-Pacific region30 have clearly
shown the survival benefit in using single-agent sorafenib
in patients with advanced HCC. In fact, sorafenib is an
antiangiogenic multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It
exerts its antiangiogenic effect by inhibiting VEGF and
PDGF receptors, and targets cancer cell proliferation via
Raff kinase inhibition. It is currently the only approved
treatment for advanced HCC. In the Western trial, the
patients randomized to the sorafenib arm had median
time to progression (TTP) of 5.5 months and OS of 10.7
months. Conversely, in the Asian trial, the TTP and OS
were 2.8 months and 6.5 months, respectively. Of note,
the overwhelming majority of the patients enrolled in
these 2 pivotal sorafenib trials had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis,
with good clinical parameters and preserved liver function. In contrast, most of the recruited patients in this
study had Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. This was because during the phase 2 recruitment period, most of patients with
Child-Pugh A cirrhosis were offered sorafenib. However,
sorafenib was not yet the standard treatment for advanced
HCC patients with underlying Child-Pugh B cirrhosis;
thus, most of these patients were recruited into clinical trials. Despite these adverse prognostic factors in patients
recruited in our present study, the survival results demonstrated in the current study were at least comparable to the
2 pivotal sorafenib studies. Moreover, 26% of patients
had partial response in our study, which was in distinct
contrast to the 3% to 6% RR obtained in the SHARP29
and Asian studies.30
Doxorubicin is usually associated with significant

toxicities. In particular, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is frequently encountered in patients treated with doxorubicin.7 In the sorafenib and doxorubicin combination
study,18 > one-third of the recruited patients experienced
significant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia regardless of whether
they received single-agent doxorubicin or the sorafenib
and doxorubicin combination. Similarly, in the present
study, > one-third of the patients developed neutropenia,
with neutropenic sepsis occurring in 2 patients. The commonest nonhematological toxicities encountered in our
current study were mucositis and alopecia, which were
caused by the administration of doxorubicin. Overall,
> one-third of the patients required dose reduction for
doxorubicin during their treatment courses. This implies
that doxorubicin treatment may pose significant treatment-related toxicities in advanced HCC patients. Thus,
doxorubicin may not be an ideal choice of chemotherapy
partner in future clinical trials for advanced HCC. Conversely, mild hypertension occurred in around one-fifth of
the recruited patients, and it was likely related to PTK
administration.31 Bleeding complication is usually among
the commonest causes of mortality in patients receiving
antiangiogenic-based therapy. In the phase 2 study of bevacizumab in HCC conducted by Siegel et al.,27 11% of
the enrolled patients had grade 3 or higher hemorrhage,
including 1 patient who died of variceal bleeding. Similarly, in our current study, 2 patients died of uncontrolled
bleeding after the administration of PTK and doxorubicin. However, it is worthwhile to note that the patients
recruited in this study had more advanced cirrhosis and
hence were more prone to bleeding complications. Thus,
these phenomena suggest that zealous patient selection is
needed before offering antiangiogenic therapy to patients
with advanced HCC patients.
This is the first study on combination of PTK with
intravenous doxorubicin for HCC patients. Several major
limitations of the study needed to be addressed. First, the
current combination is an empirical combination without
preclinical data supporting potential synergistic action
between doxorubicin and PTK. Also, the relative contribution of either agent in the treatment of advanced HCC
is still unknown, although in a phase 1 study conducted
by Koch et al., a 750-mg daily dosage of PTK showed preliminary efficacy in advanced HCC patients.32 Second,
the study does not include any detailed pharmacokinetic
or pharmacodynamic parameters for analysis. Third, disease assessment was only performed every 9 weeks instead
of the current standard of 6 to 8 weeks in most systemic
trials of advanced HCC patients. Thus, the calculation of

5028

PFS, which largely depends on the schedule of radiological assessment, may be overestimated. Last but not least,
doxorubicin may not be an ideal chemotherapy partner
because of its significant treatment-related toxicities and
unproven efficacy in advanced HCC. Nevertheless, this
study is an important proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the encouraging activity in using an antiangiogenic
agent—PTK—to augment the efficacy of intravenous
doxorubicin in treating advanced HCC patients. On the
basis of our current results, the idea of combining antiangiogenic agents together with chemotherapy may warrant
further evaluation in future clinical trials.
