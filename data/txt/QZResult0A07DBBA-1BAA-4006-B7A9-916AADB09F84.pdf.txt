ABSTRACT
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, affecting angiogenesis, have shown therapeutic
efficacy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The increased overall survival is not fully
explained by their anti-tumor activity, since these drugs frequently induce disease
stabilization rather than regression. RCC patients frequently develop cachectic
syndrome. We used the RXF393 human renal carcinoma xenograft that recapitulates
the characteristics of the disease, including the growth in the mouse kidney
(orthotopic implantation), and the induction of cachexia with subsequent premature
death. Sunitinib prevents body weight loss and muscle wasting and significantly
improves the survival of RXF393-bearing nude mice. The anti-cachectic effect was
not associated to direct anti-tumor activity of the drug. Most relevant is the ability
of sunitinib to reverse the cachectic phenotype and rescue the animals from the
loss of fat tissue. Body weight loss is prevented also in mice bearing the C26 colon
carcinoma, classically reported to induce cachexia in immunocompetent mice. Among
the mechanisms, we herein show that sunitinib is able to restrain the overactivation
of STAT3 and MuRF-1 pathways, involved in enhanced muscle protein catabolism
during cancer cachexia.
We suggest that off-target effects of angiogenesis inhibitors targeting STAT3
are worth considering as a therapeutic option for patients who develop cachexia,
independently of their anti-tumor activity.

normally aimed at the best supportive care [5, 6].
Patients afflicted by renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
frequently develop cachexia [7]. This syndrome is believed
to be caused by the secretion of cytokines or hormones
from the tumor or the immune system [8]. Tumor-specific
growth factors, like vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), are
also highly secreted by RCC [8]. In the past five years,
the introduction of targeted anti-angiogenic therapy has
dramatically enlarged the number of therapeutic options
for the treatment of RCC and significantly improved the
prospects for patients [9].
Sunitinib is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) that mainly targets VEGF and PDGF
receptors and it was the first oral TKI to gain regulatory
approval in this setting [10]. Sunitinib is the reference
standard of care, recommended in international guidelines
for the first-line treatment of favorable- or intermediaterisk RCC [11]. The range of agents available for the
treatment of RCC has expanded substantially, including
sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus, bevacizumab
in combination with interferon-α and, more recently,
pazopanib and axitinib [12]. However, while increasing
overall survival, these targeted drugs frequently induce
only disease stabilization. Since survival benefits in RCC
patients do not always correlate with tumor response,
other unknown mechanisms may account for the clinical
benefits.
In the present study, we show that mice bearing
RCC-derived RXF393 develop cachexia (i.e. body weight
loss), which is prevented and/or reversed upon treatment
with sunitinib, resulting in increased survival. Both muscle
and fat tissues undergo wasting in RXF393-bearing mice
and sunitinib is able to prevent the loss of both. This
unprecedented therapeutic effect is not associated with
its anti-tumor activity and involves prevention of STAT3
activation and MuRF-1 over-expression in muscles. As a
consequence, STAT3 inhibitors should be worth evaluating
as a therapeutic option for cancer patients who develop
cachexia.

When tumor-bearing mice were treated with sunitinib,
the inverse correlation between tumor and body weight
was lost, but it was rapidly restored when treatment was
interrupted (Fig.1B). Sunitinib treatment (started at about
100 mg of TW) had a moderate, but significant anti-tumor
effect (T/C 30%) (Fig.1C, left). All the RXF393-bearing
mice treated with vehicle developed cachexia (BWL >
20%) and ought to be killed within 23 days after tumor
transplantation (Fig.1C, middle), whereas the overall
survival (time of sacrifice) of sunitinib-treated mice was
significantly higher (MST 51 days; ILS 250%) (Fig.1C,
right) and, surprisingly, the tumor reached the maximal
ethically accepted weight (< 2000mg) without causing
cachexia. At autopsy, subcutaneous tumors harvested
from sunitinib-treated mice showed a pale phenotype,
compared to the highly vascularized appearance of the
vehicle-treated tumors, consistent with the anti-vascular
activity of sunitinib (Fig.1C, inserts). Immunohistological
analysis confirmed the lower vessel density in sunitinibtreated tumors (data not shown).
To exclude that the anti-cachectic effects of sunitinib
depends on its effect on tumor growth, we compared the
therapeutic active dose of sunitinib (40mg/kg) to suboptimal doses (20 and 10mg/kg) in RXF393-bearing
mice. As shown in Fig.1D, left, 40mg/kg inhibited tumor
growth, while doses of 20mg/kg or 10mg/kg did not exert
anti-tumor effects. However, a dose-response effect on
BWL was observed: 10mg/kg delayed BWL by four days
and 20mg/kg was able to preserve body mass (Fig.1D,
right). These results suggest that the effect on cachexia
by sunitinib involves mechanisms aside from inhibition of
angiogenesis and tumor growth.
To confirm the anti-cachectic effects of sunitinib
in a more relevant setting, RXF393 was transplanted
orthotopically in the kidney of nude mice (Fig.2). Tumorbearing mice started losing body weight in three weeks
(Fig.2A), and were to be sacrificed (MST 30 days, Fig.2B)
when their tumorgrafts reached about 600 mg (Fig.2C),
because of clear signs of discomfort (i.e. kyphosis,
immobility, tremor; 20% of BWL). In contrast, sunitinibtreated mice lived significantly longer (MST 51 days; ILS
70%, Fig.2B) and no sign of BWL was observed when
mice were sacrificed with a tumor mass of approx. >1g,
(Fig.2A and C). At autopsy, tumors growing in the kidney
of sunitinib-treated mice had a pale phenotype, consistent
with the drug’s activity (Fig.2C).

RESULTS
Sunitinib prevents RXF393-induced cachexia
The human renal carcinoma RXF393 transplanted
in nude mice forms a rapidly growing tumor causing
progressive body weight loss (BWL), typical of the
cachectic syndrome. As shown in Figure 1A, all RXF393bearing mice rapidly lost weight (a hallmark of cachexia)
around 15 days after subcutaneous tumor transplantation,
when tumor weight (TW) was about 700 mg, and died
shortly after. A significant inverse correlation was observed
between tumor and body weight (R=-0.941, P<0.001).

Sunitinib prevents RXF393-induced muscle
wasting
One of the key features of cancer-induced wasting
syndrome is the loss of skeletal muscle mass [13]. To test
whether cachexia was accompanied by skeletal muscle
atrophy, and whether sunitinib prevented this, mice
bearing subcutaneous RXF393 were treated with sunitinib
or vehicle and muscle wasting was analyzed at autopsy.

To exclude differences due to the tumor burden, RXF393bearing mice from vehicle- and sunitinib-treated groups
were sacrificed when tumor reached comparable sizes.
Comparable tumor weights (about 400mg) were
associated to significant BWL in vehicle-treated mice,
whereas the body weight of sunitinib-treated ones were
undistinguishable from age- and sex-matched healthy
mice (tumor-free) (Fig.3A). After death, heart, tibialis
anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius muscles were collected
and weighed. In RXF393-bearing mice, no loss of heart
weight was observed both in vehicle- and sunitinibtreated mice (Fig.3B) compared to healthy mice, while the
weight of TA and gastrocnemius muscles from vehicletreated ones decreased by about 25% (Fig.3C). Strikingly,
the mean weight of both muscles from sunitinib-treated

mice did not significantly differ from that of healthy
mice, indicating that sunitinib completely protects from
RXF393-induced muscle wasting (Fig.3C). Moreover, the
cross-sectional area (CSA) of the TA myofibers showed a
significant reduction between vehicle-treated and healthy
animals (1122 μm2 and 1789 μm2, respectively), which
was partially but significantly restored upon sunitinib
treatment (1432 μm2) (Fig.3D, left). Accordingly,
electron microscopy ultra-structural analysis of the TA
muscles of healthy mice showed the expected crosssectional organization of thin and thick filaments in
myofibrils, surrounded by mitochondria and cisternae
of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Conversely, cachectic
muscles from tumor-bearing mice showed derangement
and degeneration of both types of filaments, while

mice within 15 days (Fig.4A). Likewise RXF393 model,
there was a significant inverse correlation between tumor
and body weight (R=-0.9, P<0.05) (Fig.4A).
Sunitinib only minimally inhibited the tumor growth
(T/C 69%) (Fig.4B), but it significantly delayed the BWL
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig.4C, left). However,
when the treatment was interrupted at day 20, all the mice
previously treated with sunitinib lost weight and were
terminally euthanized within one week (Fig.4C).
To exclude that the lower BWL in sunitinib-treated
mice was caused by smaller tumors due to treatment, we
compared mice bearing tumors of similar size (about
280 mg), irrespectively of the time after transplantation
and found that the body weight of sunitinib-treated was
significantly higher than that of vehicle-treated mice
(Fig.4D).

Sunitinib prevents C26-induced cachexia
The beneficial effects of sunitinib were further
confirmed in another experimental model fully
characterized for cancer cachexia and previously used to
study anti-cachexia interventions: the murine C26 colon
carcinoma [14].
As expected, the C26 tumor induced about 5% BWL
already 11 days after transplantation and, when BWL
reached 20%, it led to death 90% of the vehicle-treated

day 24). Vehicle-treated mice lost fat tissue concomitantly
to BWL (day 16). As expected, soon after suspension of
sunitinib treatment, mice started to lose weight (Fig.5A)
and fat tissue (Fig.5C, day 33) at a level comparable to
untreated mice. Of note, body mass was not significantly
affected in tumor-free mice treated or not with sunitinib
(data not shown). Altogether, these data show that
sunitinib treatment exerts its effects, such as preservation
of body mass and fat tissue, as long as its administration
is maintained, and even if cachexia has already advanced.

To test the ability of sunitinib to reverse the wasting
syndrome once established, mice bearing RXF393 and
developing cachexia were randomized to receive sunitinib
or vehicle, when BWL was around 10% (14 days after
tumor implantation). As shown in Fig.5A, sunitinib
completely and rapidly reversed BWL even when
treatment started with larger tumors (about 600-700 mg,
Fig.5B). The recovery in body weight was accompanied
by a gain in fat tissue, as shown by micro-CT (computed
tomography) scans of the entire abdominal region of
tumor-bearing mice treated with sunitinib (Fig.5C and D,

Sunitinib prevents MuRF-1 and STAT3 activation
in muscle of RXF393-bearing mice

p-AKT over total AKT, usually considered as index of
protein synthesis, were also evaluated, but not significant
difference was detected (data not shown).
An important mediator implicated in the
development of cancer cachexia is the transcription
factor STAT3 that previous work has shown activated by
circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6) [17].
Muscles from cachectic RXF393-bearing mice exhibited
over-activation of STAT3, as shown by higher levels of
phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) compared to noncachectic ones (analyzed at randomization) (Fig.6B).
Sunitinib inhibited p-STAT3 of muscles from RXF393bearing mice at levels comparable to non-cachectic mice.
Similar results were obtained with sorafenib,
another multitargeted TKI, also used for the treatment of
renal cancer [18]. Administration of sorafenib prevented
the body and muscle weight loss in RXF393-bearing mice
and this was associated with the inhibition of STAT3 and

Loss of skeletal muscle mass is generally due
to reduced protein synthesis, increased degradation or
a relative imbalance of the two [3, 4]. The molecular
pathways implicated in these mechanisms were
investigated in TA muscles of vehicle- and sunitinibtreated mice. The Muscle RING Finger 1 protein (MuRF1), a muscle-restricted ubiquitin ligase involved in the
accelerated protein degradation during various kinds of
muscle atrophy [15], was found highly up-regulated in
muscles from cachectic RXF393-bearing mice, while
sunitinib treatment was able to prevent MuRF-1 upregulation (Fig.6A). More prolonged sunitinib treatment
led to down-regulation of atrogin-1, another musclespecific ubiquitin ligase triggering muscle atrophy [15,
16], although the effect was less evident. Levels of

chosen as reference (indicated as Random). GAPDH was used as internal loading control. Densitometric analysis was performed and

MuRF-1 pathways in TA muscles (Supplementary Fig.1).
IL-6 was elevated in plasma of mice bearing
RXF393 or C26, but sunitinib did not change its levels in
neither model (Supplementary Fig.2), suggesting that the
effect of sunitinib is not mediated by the direct attenuation
of this circulating cytokine.
Overall, these data indicate that RXF393-bearing
mice offer a unique model to test drugs against cancer
cachexia and that sunitinib, as well as sorafenib, can
prevent cachexia in vivo by lowering protein catabolism
through inhibition of STAT3/MuRF-1 activation at least
in muscles.

we observed that sunitinib not only was able to spare
the muscle mass but even the misalignment of myofibers
induced by cancer progression. As reported by Aulino
and coworkers [19] in C26-bearing mice, we report that
cachectic muscles from RXF393 mice display an aberrant
distribution of thin and thick filaments that may be due
to selective degradation of muscle proteins [22]; these
aberrations can be prevented by sunitinib, allowing
preservation of muscle mass and probably of its function.
Decreased protein synthesis and increased
proteolysis are among the mechanisms leading to muscle
loss [3]. During atrophy, MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 are
the crucial muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that direct
the polyubiquitination of proteins to target them for
proteolysis by the 26S proteasome, mediating sarcomeric
breakdown (MuRF-1, which degrades myosins) [23]
or shifting gene expression towards a less myogenic
phenotype (atrogin-1, which degrades MyoD) [24]. Our
results indicate that cachexia prevention by sunitinib is
mainly determined by the reduction of proteolysis, rather
than increased synthesis, as shown by suppression of
MuRF-1 and, though less evident, atrogin-1 induction and
unchanged levels of p-AKT/AKT ratio. Since FoxO3 is a
master transcription factor driving muscle wasting by upregulating both MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 [25, 26], we have
also measured the levels of p-FoxO3 over total FoxO3 in
the vehicle and sunitinib-treated muscles, but no difference
was detected. Instead, our data suggest that improvement
of cachexia is associated to STAT3 inhibition in muscles
by sunitinib.
Cancer cachexia is triggered by increased systemic
inflammation, where pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL6) play a major role [27]. Previous reports demonstrated
that STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 is per se sufficient
to induce muscle fiber wasting in vitro as well as in vivo
and that STAT3 inhibition would abolish skeletal muscle
wasting downstream of IL-6 in cancer cachexia models
[17, 28]. Interestingly, STAT3 has been found activated
also in wasting muscles from patients suffering from
chronic kidney disease [29] and very recently involved in
the control of satellite cell expansion and muscle repair
[30]. Moreover, the IL-6/STAT3 pathway has been also
implied in increased lipolysis of C26-bearing mice [31],
thus suggesting that in our experimental models sunitinib
may spare fat and muscle tissues through similar targets.
We found that circulating IL-6 was elevated in both nude
mice bearing RXF393 and in immunocompetent mice
bearing C26, (as described by others [32, 33]), but was
not reduced by sunitinib (Supplementary Fig.2). This
indicates that the anti-cachectic effect of sunitinib is not
due to reduced circulating IL-6 or that the inhibitory
target of sunitinib is downstream of the IL-6 cascade (i.e.
JAK) [17]. Similar results were found upon treatment of
cachectic rodents with anti-myostatin inhibitors, where
signs of cachexia were reversed without affecting IL-6 or
TNF-α plasma levels [32].

DISCUSSION
Renal cell carcinoma is one of the malignancies
that mostly causes a cancer-associated systemic syndrome
(i.e. cachexia), mainly consisting in progressive loss
of the body energy stores and likely reflecting the high
production of cytokines and growth factors [7, 8].
Herein, we report that treatment with sunitinib (and
sorafenib, Supplementary data) prolonged the survival
of mice bearing the human kidney carcinoma RXF393,
transplanted either ectopically in the subcutis or
orthotopically in the kidney (i.e. mimicking the site of
tumor origin), by blocking the BWL (i.e. muscle and fat
wasting) caused by cancer growth.
Unexpected was the ability of sunitinib to reverse
the cachectic phenotype once established. In fact, sunitinib
reversed BWL and rescued the animal from the loss of
abdominal fat tissue. The anti-cachectic effects of sunitinib
are not associated to reduced tumor growth, as revealed by
the prevention of cachexia also at sub-optimal doses of
sunitinib that did not inhibit tumor growth. Importantly,
BWL was prevented also in a syngeneic tumor model, the
C26 colon cancer, classically reported to induce cachexia
in immunocompetent mice [19]. This shows that such
anti-cachectic effect also occurs with an intact immune
system and, furthermore, implies that it is not restricted
to a single tumor model. These results might explain
the clinical evidence that often targeted drugs, including
sunitinib, increase overall survival of RCC patients,
without inducing tumor shrinkage, but rather causing
disease stabilization [18, 20].
Of note, during human RCC both cancer and
subsequent kidney dysfunction may account for the
cachectic appearance, further accelerating muscle loss
[21]. Our data, showing similar rates of BWL in mice
bearing a tumor subcutaneously or orthotopically in the
kidney, possibly exclude that kidney failure may worsen
the RXF393-related cachexia.
We have investigated the anti-cachectic effect
exerted by sunitinib not only at the macroscopic level
of multiple tissues (fat, heart and skeletal muscles) but
also at the ultrastructural level in skeletal muscle (i.e. the
most affected tissue in cancer cachexia). Surprisingly,

The RXF393 xenograft model secretes high levels of
VEGF, likely enough to cause a cachectic syndrome [34,
35]. Indeed, Cao et coworkers have shown that systemic
treatment with anti-VEGF agents reversed VEGF-induced
cancer associated systemic syndrome and prolonged
mouse survival [34]. Surprisingly, antibodies anti-VEGF
(bevacizumab) or anti-VEGF receptor 2 (DC101) did not
protect RXF393-carrying mice from cachexia to the same
extent as sunitinib (data not shown). Presumably, other
cytokines or growth factors are responsible for cachexia
in our tumor model.
Although our understanding of cancer cachexia has
improved dramatically in the past few years, guidelines for
the prevention and treatment of cancer-related cachexia
are lacking. New treatments with myostatin inhibitors,
thalidomide, selective COX-2 inhibitors, ghrelin mimetics
and selective androgen receptor modulators have shown
promising results, but their efficacy need to be confirmed
in clinical trials that are at present testing multimodal
interventions against cancer cachexia [5, 6].
Overall, we show that TKIs, such as sunitinib,
prevent BWL and preserve muscle and fat tissue, by
inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 has been
identified as a novel tumor target and several inhibitors
are under development [36]. Only very recently, its
pharmacological inhibition has been shown to be
beneficial against cancer cachexia in experimental models
[37]. Our results further encourage to regard STAT3
inhibitors as therapeutic option for cancer patients who
develop cachexia, independently of their direct anti-tumor
activity.

Nude mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions and handled using aseptic procedures. C26
cells (1x106) were inoculated s.c. in the upper right flank
of male BALB/c mice (Harlan).
Tumor growth s.c. was measured twice a week with
Vernier Caliper and plotted as mean tumor weight (±SE)
against days after tumor transplantation. The efficacy of
treatment was expressed as best tumor growth inhibition
[%T/C = (median weight of treated tumors/median weight
of control tumors) × 100]. In the orthotopic model, tumor
appearance was checked twice a week by palpation.
Cachexia was followed by recording body weight that
was plotted as the mean (±SE) against days after tumor
transplantation. Mice were sacrificed when BWL reached
> 20% and/or the animals showed clear signs of distress
(ruffled fur for BALB/c mice, tremor, loss of mobility,
kyphosis), however with a tumor burden < 2 g. Survival
day was the time at which mice were euthanized.
The increment of life span (ILS) was calculated as
100x[(median survival day of treated mice – median
survival day of vehicle treated mice)/ median survival day
of vehicle treated]. Animal study management and data
collection were done with the Study Director 1.8 software

Sunitinib (Chemietek) was dissolved in methocel
0.5% and further diluted in saline solution immediately
before use. It was administered daily orally by gavage at
the dose of 40mg/Kg, unless otherwise indicated.

Micro-CT analysis
Mice were anesthetized with a continuous flow
of 3% isoflurane/oxygen mixture and positioned prone
with both legs at right angles. The region spanning the
entire torso to the distal tibia of each mouse was scanned
with Explore Locus micro-CT scanner (GE Healthcare)
without contrast agents. Micro-CT projections of the
animals were acquired using 80 kV, 450 μA current, with
100 ms acquisition time. Four hundred projections were

Mice and tumor models
RXF393 cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.,
1.5x106 cells) into the flank or orthotopically (1x105 cells)

acquired over 360°. The resolution of the acquired images
was 93 μm. The reconstructed 3D images were visualized
and analyzed using MicroView analysis software (GE
Healthcare).
The amount of adipose tissue was determined
as described by Luu et al.[40]. Briefly, the gray-scale
histogram of the reconstructed images presents a peak that
indicates the presence of fat. A low and a high gray-scale
threshold corresponding to that peak were chosen. The fat
was quantified as the sum of the volumes of all the voxels
with a gray-scale value ranging between the low and the
high thresholds. The analysis was done on the abdominal
region (between the proximal end of L1 and the distal end
of S1).

signal was detected with CDP-Star® Substrate (Life
Technologies). The MuRF-1 antibody was raised against
rat MuRF-1, as previously described [15].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using Prism Software
(GraphPad Prism 5.01). Differences in survival were
analyzed by the log-rank test. Correlation was assessed
by a standard Pearson correlation, after the symmetry
of the distribution was assured with Skewness and
Kurtosis. Differences among groups of non-time-related
measurements were assessed by one-way ANOVA
followed by the Bonferroni post-test.
In the figures, significance is indicated as follows: *
P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001.

Electron microscopy
Tibialis Anterior muscles from control, untreated
and sunitinib-treated mice were excised at sacrifice, cut
in the sagittal plane with a razor blade and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 2% glutaraldehyde
in phosphate buffer 0.12 M, pH 7.4 for 2 hours at 4°C,
followed by incubation at room temperature for 2h in
OsO4. After dehydration, tissue samples were cleared
in propylene oxide, embedded in epoxy medium (Epon
812 Fluka) and polymerized at 60°C for 72 h. From each
sample, ultrathin (60 nm thick) sections of areas of interest
were obtained, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate, and examined with an Energy Filter Transmission
Electron Microscope (EFTEM, ZEISS LIBRA® 120)
equipped with a YAG scintillator slow-scan CCD camera.
