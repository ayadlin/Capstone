Skin Cancer

Abstract
Inflammatory conditions elicited by extrinsic environmental factors promote malignant cell transformation,
tumor growth, and metastasis. Although most attention has been focused on innate immune mechanisms of
inflammatory carcinogenesis, more recently the role of T cells in cancer promotion has been examined. Although
IFN-dependent Th1 responses that promote Stat1 signaling inhibit tumor growth, the role of T helper type 17
responses, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in particular, has been controversial. Indeed, IL-17 has been reported to
either enhance or inhibit the growth of transplantable tumors, depending on the system. Little is known about
the role of IL-17 in de novo carcinogenesis. Using IL-17 knockout mice, we examined the role of IL-17 in the
classic DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis model. Disruption of IL-17 dramatically reduced tumorigenesis
in this model in a manner correlated with diminished Stat3 activation in the tumor microenvironment. IL-17 loss
reduced Stat3-associated proliferative and antiapoptotic gene expression along with epidermal cell proliferation
and hyperplasia. In addition, IL-17 loss was associated with reduced expression of Stat3-regulated chemokines
that attract myeloid cells and a decreased infiltration of myeloid cells into the local tumor microenvironment.
Together, our findings point to a critical role of the IL-17–Stat3 pathway in supporting cancer-associated
inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic approaches that target this pathway may therefore
be effective to inhibit carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10112–20. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Epidemiologic studies identified chronic inflammation as a
major risk factor for various types of cancer (1). As a core
transcriptional mediator of inflammation, NF-kB activation is
a central component of procarcinogenic innate immune
responses (2). In a number of systems, Stat3 activation in
both epithelial and myeloid cells is a critical downstream
mediator of tumorigenesis (3–5). Stat3 activation in epithelial
cells drives the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinases,
antiapoptotic genes, and proangiogenesis genes, all of which
are important for tumor growth (5). Stat3 activation in
myeloid cells has been shown to inhibit transcription of the
antitumor cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) while promoting
expression of the procarcinogenic IL-12 family cytokine
IL-23 (6). More recently, attention has turned to the role of

adaptive immunity, particularly T cell–mediated responses, in
tumorigenesis. T-cell immunity can promote or inhibit cancer
development and growth (7–11) and it is therefore critical to
determine how specific T-cell lineages selectively affect cancer
growth. T helper type 1 (Th1) responses promoted by IL-12
seem to mediate antitumor responses via production of IFN-g
and enhancement of antitumor CTLs (12). Stat1 signaling is
important in both the induction and effector phases of Th1type immunity (13). The nature of T-cell responses that
promote carcinogenesis and cancer growth is less clear. A
number of colon carcinogenesis models have suggested a
positive association between the major Th17 cytokine
IL-17A (commonly termed IL-17) and cancer development
(14). This makes sense, as Stat3 signaling is not only procarcinogenic but also central to Th17 differentiation and function
(15). In addition, the Stat3-induced procarcinogenic cytokine
IL-23 maintains and mediates expansion of Th17 cells (16).
However, the role of IL-17 in growth of established tumors is
unclear. Although several reports suggest that certain transplanted tumors grow more slowly in mice lacking either IL-17
or IL-17 receptor (7, 9), other groups have reported increased
growth of transplanted tumors in the absence of IL-17, suggesting that the role of IL-17 in cancer is context dependent
(17, 18). Moreover, clinically, the presence of Th17 cells in
tumors has been associated with both favorable and unfavorable prognoses (19–21). These conflicting observations warrant further investigations into the role of IL-17 in cancer.
To further assess the role of IL-17 in the carcinogenesis
process, we have explored a classic model of inflammation-

induced skin cancer, using 7,12-dimenthylbenz[a]anthracene
(DMBA) and 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).
This model has been widely used to study how an extrinsic
chemically induced inflammation initiates epithelial transformation and promotes subsequent papilloma development (22,
23). In this 2-stage carcinogenesis model, DMBA induces
mutations in dermal epithelium at the earliest stage whereas
TPA administration elicits an inflammatory response that
mediates further transformation, resulting in papilloma development.
We show that IL-17 is an important tumor-promoting
element in DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis. IL-17 induces
Stat3 activation, epithelial hyperproliferation, and
CD11bþGr-1þ myeloid cell infiltration at the site of tumor
initiation. Our findings support the notion that Th17
responses can enhance carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Animals and animal care
Wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from the National
Cancer Institute unless indicated specifically. IFN-g /
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
The generation of C57BL/6 IL-17 / mice has been previously
reported (24), and the mice were provided by Y. Iwakura
(University of Tokyo). Mouse care and experimental procedures were performed under pathogen-free conditions in
accordance with established institutional guidance and
approved protocols from the Research Animal Care Committee of the City of Hope Medical Center (Duarte, CA).
DMBA/TPA-induced epithelial carcinogenesis
procedure
The 2-stage skin carcinogenesis was conducted on the basis
of peer reports (23). Briefly, the dorsal skin of mice was shaved
and painted with DMBA (Sigma) in 200 mL of acetone at 100 mg
per mouse once and then treated with TPA in 200 mL of
acetone at 30 mg per mouse twice a week. Mice were evaluated
weekly for papilloma development. Only tumors that had
attained a size of 1 mm or greater and were present for a
week or more were counted.
Isolation of mononuclear cells from skin
Mononuclear cell isolation from skin was performed as
previously described (25). Briefly, dorsal skin (3  3 cm2) was
cut into small pieces and shaken in RPMI containing 5% fetal
bovine serum, 10 mmol/L of HEPES (Irvine Scientific), 0.01%
DNase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.27% collagenase type I (SigmaAldrich), and 1,000 U/mL of hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 37 C for 1 hour. Skin tissue and suspension were then
intensively washed with PBS containing 2 mmol/L of EDTA
and filtered with a 70-mm cell strainer before enrichment with
Lympholyte M (Accurate Chemical & Scientific).
Monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometric analysis
Antibodies to mouse CD4, CD8, TCRb, CD11b, Gr-1, IL-17,
and IFN-g were all purchased from eBioscience. For intracellular staining, cells were stimulated with plate-bound CD3/

www.aacrjournals.org

CD28 for 5 hours, and Brefeldin A (10 mg/mL) was added in the
last 2 hours. Cells were then harvested and stained for
cytokines. Dead cells were excluded by Fixable Aqua Dead
Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen).
Immunofluorescence staining
Paraffin-embedded specimens were deparaffinized,
hydrated, and autoclaved in antigen unmasking solution
(Vector) before being stained with antibodies specific to
Ki67 (Abcam). Specimens were then detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen).
After staining with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) to visualize
cell nuclei, slides were mounted and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA from skin sample was extracted by RNeasy
Fibrous Tissue kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using
iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Mouse IL-17, IL-6, Bcl-XL,
survivin, cyclin D1, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), IL-1b,
CXCL2, and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) primers were purchased
from SABiosciences. Sequence for CXCL1 primers is as follows:
sense, 50 -CAAGAACATCCAGAGCTTGAAGGT-30 ; antisense, 50 GTGGCTATGACTTCGGTTTGG-30 . Sequence for S100A8 primer is as follows: sense, 50 -CCAATTCTCTGAACAAGTTTTCG30 ; antisense, 50 -TCACCATGCCCTCTACAAGA-30 . Sequence for
S100A9 primer is as follows: sense, 50 -GTCCAGGTCCTCCATGATGT-30 ; antisense, 50 -TCAGACAAATGGTGGAAGCA-30 .
Statistical analysis
Unpaired t test was used to calculate the 2-tailed P value.
Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). For real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, data
before normalization were used for t-test analysis.

Results
Elevated IL-17 expression and Stat3 activation in
DMBA/TPA-administrated mice
To study the role of IL-17 in skin carcinogenesis, we first
examined the expression of IL-17 in skin after DMBA/TPA
administration. We found that the expression of IL-17 was
induced approximately 4-fold after 3 hours of the first TPA
administration (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous
observation that IL-17 can induce IL-6 expression (9), we
observed similar kinetics for IL-6 expression after the TPA
administration (Fig. 1A). After the repeated biweekly application of TPA for 20 weeks, the expression of IL-17 and IL-6
was further increased and constitutively maintained at a
high level in skin of TPA-treated mice (Fig. 1A). These
results indicate that DMBA/TPA administration can elicit
a strong IL-17 response, with associated inflammation in
the local epidermal environment.
We next investigated whether TPA-induced IL-17 and IL-6
production would mediate Stat3 activation. We observed that
Stat3 phosphorylation was also markedly increased in skin
3 hours post–TPA administration but reduced 24 hours

post–TPA administration (Fig. 1B). Stat3 activation was maintained at a high level after long-term TPA treatment (Fig. 1B).
Taken together, these results indicate that DMBA/TPA
administration elicits a strong induction of IL-17 in epidermal
local environment, which is associated with constitutively
activated Stat3 signaling.
IL-17/ mice are resistant to the DMBA/TPA-induced
epithelial carcinogenesis
We next assessed the role of IL-17 in this skin carcinogenesis model using genetic knockout. Sex-, age-, and matched
WT and IL-17/ mice were administrated with DMBA/TPA.
We found that the IL-17/ mice were strongly resistant to
DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis as compared to WT controls. While about 80% of WT mice developed papillomas by
13 weeks post–DMBA/TPA administration, only 10% of the
IL-17/ mice developed any papillomas (Fig. 2A). After
extending TPA administration to 20 weeks, approximately
50% of IL-17/ mice remained papilloma-free (Fig. 2A). Those
IL-17/ mice that did develop papillomas had significantly
fewer and smaller papillomas than WT mice (Fig. 2B–D).
Because Th1 cytokine IFN-g exerts reciprocal regulation
and distinct effector functions relative to IL-17 in vivo, we
also tested the skin carcinogenesis with TPA/DMBA treatments in IFN-g / and IFN-g / IL-17/ mice. Although we
found only a small change in papilloma development in the
absence of IFN-g, papilloma development in IFN-g /IL-17/
mice was dramatically reduced as relative to IFN-g / mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Because of genetic background differences among WT mice from the National Cancer Institute
and IL-17/, IFN-g /, and IFN-g /IL-17/ mice, we
repeated DMBA/TPA treatment by using WT mice from
The Jackson Laboratory. We observed reduced papilloma
development in IL-17/ mice relative to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results emphasize the pivotal role
played by IL-17 in skin carcinogenesis in this system.

IL-17 ablation leads to reduced Stat3 activation in the
tumor microenvironment
To determine the mechanism(s) by which IL-17 promotes
papilloma development, we next performed intracellular cytokine staining to measure IL-17 production in the inflammatory
skin. There were approximately 4% of CD4þ T cells from the
skin of DMBA/TPA-treated WT mice producing IL-17,
whereas IL-17 secreting cells were not detectable in the
IL-17/ mice (Fig. 3A, left). The lack of IL-17 expression in
IL-17/ mice was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 3A, right).
We did not detect any IL-17 production in non–T cells by
intracellular staining (data not shown). These results indicate
that DMBA/TPA administration stimulates classic Th17 cell
production of IL-17, which exerts an important role in promoting carcinogenesis-associated inflammation.
We previously reported that IL-17 is essential for the
activation of Stat3 in an IL-6–dependent manner in transplantable tumor models (9). We next tested whether loss of
IL-17 also led to reduced IL-6 expression and Stat3 activity in
inflammation-driven skin carcinogenesis. IL-6 expression in
the skin samples from TPA-administrated WT versus IL-17/
mice was compared by real-time PCR. We found that IL-6
expression was reduced in the skin samples prepared from
IL-17/ mice as compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 3B).
The reduction of IL-6 in IL-17/ mice was associated with
downmodulated Stat3 activation in skin samples, as detected
by phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3; Fig. 3C). p-Stat3 activity was
also assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Stat3 was
activated in epidermal layer, outer root sheath of hair follicle,
and epidermal- and dermal-infiltrating cells in WT skin samples, whereas its activation was reduced in skin from IL-17/
mice (Fig. 3D). To specify which cell type displays decreased
p-Stat3 level, we performed flow analysis and observed that
skin-infiltrating CD11bþGr-1þ myeloid cell and F4/80þ
macrophages had reduced Stat3 activity (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Taken together, these results indicate that the

reduced tumor carcinogenesis and papilloma development in
IL-17/ mice were associated with reduced local IL-6 production and downregulated Stat3 activation.
IL-17 promotes DMBA/TPA-mediated epidermal
hyperproliferation and Stat3-regulated oncogenic
gene expression
As an oncogenic transcriptional factor in tumor, Stat3
activation mediates the proliferation of malignant cells and
their escape from apoptosis (5). Treatment with a Stat3
antagonist suppresses DMBA/TPA-induced epithelial hyperproliferation and subsequently carcinogenesis process (26).
Because Stat3 activation was reduced in DMBA/TPA-treated
skin samples from IL-17/ mice, we reasoned that reduced
carcinogenesis in IL-17/ mice may result from downregulated premalignant epidermal hyperproliferation. We
therefore compared the histologic changes in DMBA/TPAtreated skin samples prepared from WT or IL-17/ mice.
We observed abnormal epidermal thickening and hyperplasia in DMBA/TPA-administrated WT mice, which were

dramatically reduced in the skin samples of IL-17 / mice
(Fig. 4A). However, we did not observe any phenotypic
differences in squamous papilloma between WT and IL17/ mice. Further in situ Ki67 staining of proliferating
cells revealed that there were fewer Ki67þ proliferating cells
in skin samples prepared from IL-17/ mice than from WT
control (Fig. 4A). Further evaluation of apoptosis in skin
samples from WT and IL-17/ mice was made by staining of
cleaved caspase 3. We observed increased cleaved caspase 3
staining in IL-17/ mice as compared with WT mice
(Fig. 4A). We also compared expression of several of
Stat3-regulated proliferative and antiapoptotic genes in
DMBA/TPA-treated skin samples from WT and IL-17/
mice. We found that Stat3 signature oncogenic genes, such
as cyclin D1, bcl-xL, and survivin, were markedly reduced in
IL-17/ mice as compared with WT control (Fig. 4B and C).
Taken together, these results suggest that DMBA/TPAinduced IL-17 plays a critical role in promoting epithelial
cell hyperproliferation through the induction of Stat3 and its
regulated oncogenic gene expression.

The skin carcinogenesis induced by DMBA/TPA administration has been recognized as an example of inflammationdriven tumorigenesis. Infiltration of immune cells and the
local production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators are
essential for this carcinogenesis process. To test the role of IL17 in the tumor-associated inflammation, we compared

granzyme B expression among CD8þ T cells from WT and

analyzed immune cell infiltration in skin samples after acute

and moderately reduced CD11bþ myeloid cell infiltration in
IL-17/ mice (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
Although CD8þIFN-g þ T cells have been associated with
antitumor immune responses, CD11bþGr-1þ myeloid cells in
the tumor microenvironment are cancer promoting and Stat3
is required for the generation and recruitment of myeloid cells
into the tumor environment (27, 28). We next compared

but reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9),
IL-17F, and IL-21 (Supplementary Fig. S4A–C).

IL-17–Stat3 in Skin Tumorigenesis

Discussion
We have shown that, in the DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis model, local IL-17 production by CD4þ T cells
plays a critical role in papilloma genesis and development.
TPA-induced IL-17 production induced persistently activated
oncogenic Stat3 and promoted subsequent epidermal cell
proliferation and hyperplasia. In contrast, mice lacking IL-17
exhibited diminished Stat3 activation, reduced Stat3-associated oncogenic and inflammatory gene expression, and
reduced tumorigenesis. Our findings therefore revealed a
pivotal role of IL-17–Stat3 pathway in tumor carcinogenesis
process. Even though the IL-17 receptor does not seem to
signal directly through Stat3, it does activate Stat3 indirectly
through IL-6 (9, 32).
Constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumor microenvironment
has been observed in many mouse tumors and human cancers
(33). Although overactivation of various tyrosine kinases
induces persistent Stat3 activation in transformed cells, Stat3
activation in the tumor microenvironment is mediated by
many extrinsic mediators, including cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-10,
and IL-23) and growth factors (vascular endothelial growth
factor and fibroblast growth factor 2) whose receptors are
known to signal through Stat3 (6, 34). We previously reported
that in the tumor progression stage, IL-17 is a potent activator
of Stat3 signaling through stimulating IL-6 production (9). In
the current study, we showed that IL-17 triggered by the
extrinsically administered chemical TPA played a critical role
in elevating Stat3 signaling and its associated gene transcription in the tumor initiation stage, which subsequently promotes malignant cell proliferation and formation of
papillomas. This observation is in agreement with a recent
report showing that a human colonic commensal [enterotoxogenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF)] promotes colon tumorigenesis in a Th17–Stat3-dependent manner (14). These
studies emphasize an important role of IL-17 in activating
Stat3 in tumor-associated inflammatory conditions. However,
our results do not address the role of IL-17 in the initiation
stage of papilloma development. Using IL-17 neutralizing
antibody before DMBA treatment may provide important
information on whether IL-17 is critical for papilloma development at early stages.
Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role of TNFa/NF-kB axis in the DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis model
(35). It has been shown that TNF-a contributed to tumor
progression by increasing myeloid cell recruitment in an
IL-17–dependent way (36). In our study, we observed reduction of TNF-a in IL-17/ mice. At this point, it remains to be
clarified whether Stat3 signaling inhibits TNF-a indirectly or
directly. Several independent studies have shown that NF-kB–
induced tumorigenesis is Stat3 dependent (37).
Although consistent with several recent publications on the
role of IL-17 in promoting growth of transplanted tumor
growth (7, 9) and ETBF-induced colon tumorigenesis in
Min mice (14), these findings contradict other reports suggesting that IL-17 can provide an antitumor effect against
certain transplanted tumors (17, 18). In addition, a recent
report demonstrated that lung metastases from polyoma

middle T–driven breast cancer involved a Th2-dependent
mechanism (38). It is therefore possible that cytokine requirements for growth versus inhibition of established tumors or
metastases may be diverse depending on tumor type and
expression of cytokine receptors by tumor cells themselves.
These requirements are likely quite different from de novo
carcinogenesis that seems to be enhanced by IL-17 and Stat3
signaling. Further analysis of additional examples of transplanted tumors, natural metastases, and de novo carcinogenesis will be necessary to define whether there are common or
distinct immunologic responses for these processes.
The IL-17–Stat3 pathway can promote epithelial carcinogenesis at multiple levels. First, as an oncogenic transcription
factor, Stat3 activation in epithelial cells is associated with cell
proliferation and antiapoptosis. We observed that Stat3 is
constitutively activated in DMBA/TPA-treated skin, which is
associated with elevated expression of Stat3-regulated proliferation and antiapoptosis genes. Downmodulated Stat3 activation in IL-17/ mice resulted in reduced epithelial cell
hyperproliferation and gland hyperplasia and downregulated
oncogenic gene expression. Second, Stat3 activation can result
in dysregulated immune surveillance against tumors. Tumorinfiltrating myeloid cells are reported to be immunosuppressive and can facilitate malignant cells escaping from the
immune surveillance. The IL-17–Stat3 pathway augments
the recruitment of myeloid cells but not of CD8þ T cells into
the local skin environment. Stat3-regulated inflammatory
mediator expression, including Cox-2, CXCL1, CXCL2,
S100A8, S100A9, and IL-1b, has been reported to be critical
for the generation of myeloid suppressive cells and granulocyte cells into the inflammatory environment (27, 29–31).
Finally, IL-17–Stat3 signaling can upregulate MMP9 expression to facilitate the tumor angiogenesis. In agreement with
this notion, we observed that lack of IL-17 is associated with
reduced MMP9 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
In summary, our study has emphasized an important role of
IL-17–Stat3 pathway in promoting epithelial carcinogenesis.
Therapies that target IL-17 and Stat3 may be developed as
potential therapeutic approaches to inhibit carcinogenesis.
