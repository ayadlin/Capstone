ABSTRACT
Previous studies suggest the anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac inhibits
tumorigenesis by a COX independent mechanism involving cGMP PDE inhibition.
Here we report that the cGMP PDE isozymes, PDE5 and 10, are elevated in colon
tumor cells compared with normal colonocytes, and that inhibitors and siRNAs can
selectively suppress colon tumor cell growth. Combined treatment with inhibitors
or dual knockdown suppresses tumor cell growth to a greater extent than inhibition
from either isozyme alone. A novel sulindac derivative, ADT-094 was designed to lack
COX-1/-2 inhibitory activity but have improved potency to inhibit PDE5 and 10. ADT094 displayed >500 fold higher potency to inhibit colon tumor cell growth compared
with sulindac by activating cGMP/PKG signaling to suppress proliferation and induce
apoptosis. Combined inhibition of PDE5 and 10 by treatment with ADT-094, PDE
isozyme-selective inhibitors, or by siRNA knockdown also suppresses β-catenin, TCF
transcriptional activity, and the levels of downstream targets, cyclin D1 and survivin.
These results suggest that dual inhibition of PDE5 and 10 represents novel strategy
for developing potent and selective anticancer drugs.

lesions or have been diagnosed with malignant disease and
treated, but remain at risk for disease recurrence.
Epidemiological studies have reported that the longterm use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
can significantly reduce the incidence and risk of death
from colorectal cancer by as much as 50–60% [3]. Certain
prescription-strength NSAIDs such as sulindac have also
been reported to cause regression of precancerous adenomas
in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
[4]. These observations are consistent with studies in rodent
models reporting that NSAIDs strongly inhibit intestinal
tumorigenesis induced by chemical carcinogens or by
mutations in the APC gene [5, 6]. However, the risk of
gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicity associated
with COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition and suppression of

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common
malignant disease in the Western world and is a major
public health problem that accounts for up to 12% of all
newly diagnosed cancers in the United States [1]. The
incidence and mortality rate of CRC continues to decline
because of endoscopic screening that allows for the
early detection and removal of precancerous adenomas.
However, approximately 40–50% of CRC patients who
undergo surgery, chemotherapy or radiation ultimately
relapse and die from metastatic disease [2]. As such,
there is an unmet medical need for safe and effective
chemopreventive drugs, especially for individuals at high
risk of developing CRC who present with precancerous

physiological prostaglandins limits the long-term use of
NSAIDs for chemoprevention [7].
While the pharmacological basis for the
antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs is commonly attributed
to COX-2 inhibition, many investigators have concluded
that other mechanisms account for their tumor growth
inhibitory activity, mostly because higher concentrations
are generally required to inhibit tumor cell growth
compared with concentrations required to inhibit COX-2
[8, 9]. As evidence for a COX-independent mechanism,
the non-COX inhibitory sulfone metabolite of sulindac
was reported to inhibit the growth of various tumor cell
lines in vitro and suppress tumorigenesis in multiple
animal models [10]. The mechanism by which sulindac
sulfone inhibits tumor cell growth may involve cyclic
guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP
PDE) inhibition based on its ability to inhibit certain cGMP
PDE isozymes at concentrations that suppress tumor cell
growth and ability of certain cGMP PDE inhibitors to
also suppress tumor cell growth by a similar mechanism
involving the suppression of β-catenin signaling [11, 12].
More recently, the COX inhibitory sulfide metabolite of
sulindac (SS) and other NSAIDs, including the COX-2
selective inhibitor, celecoxib, have also been reported to
inhibit cGMP PDE activity at concentrations that inhibit
tumor cell growth [13, 14].
Cyclic nucleotide PDEs are a superfamily of
related phosphohydrolases that selectively catalyze the
hydrolysis of the 3′ cyclic phosphate bonds in adenosine
and/or guanosine 3′, 5′ cyclic monophosphate (cAMP and/
or cGMP). Up to 11 PDE isozyme families comprising at
least 21 different isoforms have thus far been identified
that display different substrate specificity, biochemical
regulatory properties, pharmacological sensitivity, as well
as tissue distribution patterns [15]. PDE1, 2, 3, 10 and 11
are dual substrate-degrading isozymes, while PDE5, 6, 9 are
selective for cGMP, and PDE4, 7 and 8 are cAMP selective.
PDE functions in the cell to terminate cyclic nucleotide
signaling, whereby inhibition blocks degradation, resulting
in the elevation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels
to amplify the duration and/or magnitude of the signal to
activate various downstream mediators, such as cyclic
nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, PKA and PKG [16].
The cGMP-specific PDE5 appears to be an
important target of sulindac that is overexpressed in
colon, breast, and lung tumors [13, 14, 17–19]. However,
the involvement of additional cGMP degrading isozymes
could not be ruled out, given the non-selective cGMP PDE
inhibitory activity of sulindac and the modest tumor cell
growth inhibitory activity of PDE5 specific inhibitors,
such as sildenafil [13, 14, 19, 20]. We recently reported
that PDE10 is overexpressed in colon tumors cells and
essential for their growth [21]. Similar to PDE5, inhibition
of PDE10 can selectively inhibit colon tumor cell growth
by activating the cGMP/PKG pathway to suppress
β-catenin-dependent TCF transcriptional activity. Here we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

show that: 1) PDE5 and 10 are elevated in colon tumor
cells compared with normal colonocytes, 2) inhibitors
or siRNA knockdown of PDE5 and 10 can selectively
inhibit colon tumor cell growth, and 3) dual inhibition is
more effective than inhibiting either isozyme alone. We
also characterize a novel, non-COX inhibitory sulindac
derivative, referred to as ADT-094 that potently and
selectivity inhibits colon tumor cell growth by inhibiting
PDE5 and 10 and activating cGMP/PKG signaling to
suppress β-catenin/TCF-transcriptional activity, resulting
in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.

RESULTS
PDE5 and 10 inhibition suppresses colon tumor
cell growth
Previous studies reporting the importance of PDE5
and 10 in regulating colon tumor cell growth [21, 22] call
for further studies of these cGMP degrading isozymes in
colon tumor cells. Western blotting using isozyme specific
antibodies as shown in Figure 1A revealed that both
PDE5 and PDE10 are elevated in human HT29, HCT116,
SW480, and Caco-2 colon tumor cell lines compared with
NCM460 normal colonocytes. As previously described,
other cGMP degrading PDE isozymes, including PDE1,
2, 3, 9, and 11 were either not expressed or showed no
difference in expression between colon tumor cells and
colonocytes [21]. To determine if PDE5 and 10 are
necessary for colon tumor cell growth, cells were treated
with the PDE5 and 10 isozyme selective inhibitors,
MY5445 and papaverine, respectively, alone and in
combination. As shown in Figure 1B, both compounds
effectively inhibit HCT116 colon tumor cell growth
as single agents, while combined treatment caused
greater inhibition than each agent alone. MY5445 and
papaverine were confirmed to inhibited cGMP hydrolysis
in lysates from HCT116 colon tumor cells within the
same concentration range that inhibit growth and that
combined treatment resulted in greater inhibition of
enzymatic activity compared to either agent alone (Figure
1C). Consistent with low levels of PDE5 and PDE10 in
colonocytes, MY5445 and papaverine did not significantly
affect their growth as previously reported [14, 21].
To further define the roles of PDE5 and 10 in
colon tumor cell growth, a double knockdown strategy
was developed by transfecting stable PDE5 knockdown
HT29 colon tumor cells with PDE10 siRNA. Single and
dual knockdown of PDE5 and 10 were confirmed by
Western blotting as shown in Figure 1D. Consistent with
results observed with isozyme selective inhibitors, dual
knockdown of PDE5 and 10 caused greater suppression
of tumor cell growth compared with knockdown of either
isozyme alone (Figure 1E). In addition, knockdown
of PDE5 or PDE10 did not affect the growth of normal
colonocytes as previously reported [21, 22].

furan moiety, the sulfide moiety to a trimethoxyphenyl
group, and the fluoro group to a methoxy group.
Molecular modeling was used to analyze the mode
of ADT-094 binding to the catalytic domains of PDE5
and 10. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, the indene scaffold
of ADT-094 occupies a hydrophobic pocket common to
the catalytic domains in PDE5 and 10, which otherwise is
occupied by the purine ring system of the cGMP/cAMP
substrate [23–25]. The trimethoxyphenyl moiety of ADT094 is positioned near the Mg2+, Zn2+ bimetal system, the
site of cyclic phosphate hydrolysis. The PDE10 catalytic
site is larger with more accessible space primarily in the
distal region due to the smaller Thr685 and Thr688 versus
Gln775 and Ile778 of PDE5. PDE10 also has a distal
selectivity pocket [26] bound by Met713 and Pro712 and
made accessible by the small size of Gly725 (Figure 2B).
The furan moiety of ADT-094 extends into this selectivity

Because PDE5 and 10 levels are elevated in colon
tumor cells compared with colonocytes and the possibility
that SS inhibits colon tumor cell growth by a mechanism
involving PDE5 and/or 10 inhibition [13, 14, 19–22], we
hypothesized that SS can be chemically modified to improve
colon tumor cell growth activity by enhancing PDE5 and
10 inhibitory activity. A series of sulindac derivatives were
therefore synthesized and screened for ability to inhibit
PDE5 and 10 using recombinant enzymes. A lead compound
referred to as ADT-094 was identified with potent colon
tumor cell growth inhibitory activity in which the chemical
structure is shown in Figure 2A. ADT-094 was derived from
SS by substituting the carboxylic acid with an amide-linked

B. Optimized PDE10A+ADT-094 Complex. Carbon atoms of the inhibitor are in gold. The fused ring system of ADT-094 occupies the
hydrophobic central region of the catalytic site directly below Phe729; the trimethoxyphenyl moiety is positioned near the Mg2+, Zn2+ system
and its associated five waters and bridge hydroxide. The furan group in ADT-094 extends into the PDE10A selectivity pocket, a region
bounded by Met713 and Pro712 and made accessible by the small size of Gly725. The furanic hydrogens interact favorably with both the
carboxylate and carbonyl of Glu721. C. Optimized PDE5A+ADT-094 complex. Note that the fused ring system of ADT-094 occupies the
central region of the PDE5A catalytic site below Phe820 and Leu765, and its methoxyphenyl group extends toward the Mg2+, Zn2+ system.
The furan moiety is in a small pocket ringed by Ile813, Met816, Leu804, Phe786, and Ala779. This small pocket is proximal to and distinct from
the selectivity pocket of PDE10A, which is occluded here by Met816, the counterpart of Gly725 in PDE10A. Instead, the PDE5A pocket is the
consequence of the small size of Ala779.

pocket to achieve favorable interactions with both the
carboxylate and carbonyl of Glu721. PDE5 has a distinct
selectivity pocket as a consequence of the small size of
Ala779 in the place of Tyr693 in PDE10 [27]. Met816 occludes
the region characteristic of PDE10 and demarcates one
side of the PDE5 selectivity pocket (Figure 2C). The
amide linkage in ADT-094 is sufficiently flexible to
permit a favorable placement of the furan group into the
selectivity pocket of either isozyme.

Consistent with its known non-selective COX
inhibitory activity, SS inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 with
IC50 values of 1.2 and 6.4 μmol/L, respectively. Likely as
a result of substituting the carboxylic acid with a neutral
group as previously reported [28], ADT-094 essentially
lacks both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity
(Figure 3A). Consistent with predictions from molecular
modeling, ADT-094 more potently inhibits PDE5 and 10
with IC50 values of 2.4 and 0.5 μmol/L compared with

improved PDE5 and 10 inhibitory activity of ADT-094 was
paralleled with increased potency to inhibit the growth of
human HCT116 and HT29 colon tumor cell lines with IC50
values of 0.1 μmol/L, while SS inhibited growth with IC50
values of 51 and 68 μmol/L, respectively (Figure 3C). ADT094 also displayed a high degree of tumor cell selectivity
in which normal colonocytes were essentially refractory to
treatment. The tumor cell growth inhibitory activity of ADT094 and its selectivity was associated with apoptotic cell
death as evident by increased caspase activity in HCT116
colon tumor cells, but not in colonocytes (Figure 3D). In
addition, ADT-094 inhibited the proliferation of HCT116

ADT-094 selectively activates cGMP/PKG
signaling in colon tumor cells
To determine if the PDE5 and 10 inhibitory activity
of ADT-094 is responsible for its tumor cell growth
inhibitory activity, cGMP levels were measured in lysates
from HCT116 colon tumor cells treated with ADT-094 at
concentrations that suppress tumor cell growth. As shown in
Figure 4A, ADT-094 treatment significantly increased cGMP
levels within the same concentration range as required for

tumor cell growth inhibition. Consistent with its tumor cell
selectivity, ADT-094 did not significantly affect intracellular
cGMP levels in normal colonocytes (Figure 4B).
To determine if cGMP elevation by ADT-094 is
sufficient to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase
G (PKG), treatment effects on the phosphorylation of
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) were
determined in colon tumor cells treated with ADT094. As previously reported, VASP is preferentially
phosphorylated at serine 239 residue by PKG in which
the phosphorylation of this amino acid serves as an
indicator of PKG activity [29]. As shown in Figure 4C,
ADT-094 increased levels of phospho-Ser239 VASP in
HCT116 colon tumor cells without affecting total VASP
levels. These data also provide evidence that ADT-094
activates PKG at concentrations that parallel those that
inhibit colon tumor cell growth and increase intracellular
cGMP levels. We also determined the effect of ADT094 on cAMP signaling by measuring cAMP-dependent
protein kinase (PKA) activity following treatment. PKA
preferentially phosphorylates VASP at serine 157 residue
as previously reported and is used as an indicator of PKA
activity [30]. ADT-094 did not affect PKA activity at
concentrations that cause PKG activation in Caco-2 colon
tumor cells (Figure 4D). These data provide evidence that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PKG activation occurs in response to ADT-094 treatment
at concentrations that parallel those required for tumor cell
growth inhibition.

Dual inhibition of PDE5 and 10 suppresses
β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity
As previously reported, SS treatment can inhibit
Wnt/β-catenin signaling to attenuate TCF transcriptional
activity [12, 20, 31–33], which is particularly significant
for its antineoplastic activity given that stabilized β-catenin
is associated with colorectal tumorigenesis. Consistent
with a role of cGMP/PKG in regulating Wnt/β-catenin
signaling as reported previously [21, 22, 31], MY5445 and
papaverine reduced β-catenin levels, TCF transcriptional
activity, and the expression of survivin in HCT116 colon
tumor cells at concentrations that parallel those required
for PKG activation (Figure 5A, 5B). Consistent with
results from growth assays, combined treatment with
MY5445 and papaverine caused a greater inhibitory effect
on β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity compared with
each agent alone. The ability of PDE5 and 10 inhibitors
to suppress β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity was
confirmed by the double knockdown strategy as described
above (Figure 5C).

To determine if ADT-094 can suppress Wnt/βcatenin signaling by a mechanism involving PKG
activation, PKG activation and β-catenin levels were
measured in the same lysates from colon tumor cells
treated with ADT-094. As shown in Figure 5D and 5E,
ADT-094 caused a dose-dependent decrease in β-catenin
levels that parallel concentrations that are required to
activate PKG. Levels of cyclin D1 and survivin, which
are under the control of the β-catenin/TCF complex
[34] were also decreased. Furthermore, ADT-094
treatment significantly inhibited β-catenin/TCF-mediated
transcription in HCT116 and SW480 colon tumor cells as
measured by a luciferase reporter assay (Figure 5F).

for long-term use in humans due to the potential for
toxicities associated with COX inhibition and the
suppression of physiological prostaglandins. However,
numerous investigators have concluded that the basis for
the antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs may not require COX
inhibition, which suggests the feasibility of developing
safer and possibly more efficacious derivatives by
targeting the underlying mechanism. We have previously
reported that cGMP PDE inhibition and activation of
cGMP/PKG pathway is closely associated with the tumor
cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis inducing activity of
SS [12, 14, 20, 33, 35]. SS inhibits cGMP hydrolysis by
PDE2, 3, 5, and 10 with IC50 values that parallel those for
colon tumor cell growth inhibition, but does not interfere
with cAMP hydrolysis by any PDE isozyme. In addition,
activators of cAMP (e.g.  PDE4 inhibitors) or PKA
(e.g. forskolin) do not inhibit colon tumor cell growth,
which lead us to hypothesize that inhibition of cGMP
degrading PDE isozymes are responsible for the tumor

activity of NSAIDs as evident by epidemiological and
preclinical studies, this class of drugs is not recommended

cell growth inhibitory activity of SS. Here we show that
PDE5 and 10 are overexpressed in colon tumor cell lines
compared with normal colonocytes and that inhibition with
small molecule inhibitors or siRNA selectively suppress
colon tumor cell growth. The mechanism involves cGMP
elevation and activation of PKG to inhibit β-catenin/TCF
transcriptional activity, which is aberrantly induced during
colorectal cancer [13, 14, 19–21]. We report for the first
time that inhibition of PDE5 and 10 results in greater
growth suppression than inhibiting either isozyme alone.
A novel, non-COX inhibitory sulindac derivative, ADT094, also was characterized in this study to have >500
fold higher potency than SS to inhibit colon tumor cell
growth with improved tumor cell selectivity. ADT-094
suppresses tumor cell growth by inhibiting PDE5 and 10 to
activate cGMP/PKG signaling, leading to the disruption of
β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity and the synthesis of
critical proteins required for the proliferation and survival
of tumor cells.
We previously reported that modification of the
carboxylic acid moiety on SS with a positively charged
moiety can effectively block binding to both COX-1
and -2 binding [20, 36]. This effect is further demonstrated
by ADT-094 in which a neutral furan moiety is substituted
for the carboxylic acid, which effectively blocked COX-1
and -2 binding. These observations are consistent with
studies by others who have also concluded that a COXindependent mechanism is fully or partially responsible
for the antineoplastic activity of various anti-inflammatory
drugs belonging to chemically distinct families [37–39].
For example, the rank order potency among NSAIDs
to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and growth of tumor
cells do not correlate in which higher doses are generally
required to inhibit tumor cell growth compared with
concentrations needed to inhibit COX activity [8, 40].
Despite lacking COX inhibitory activity, ADT094 inhibits colon tumor cell growth with IC50 values
at least 500 fold less than SS. The improved potency to
inhibit colon tumor cell growth was paralleled with an
increase in potency to inhibit PDE5 and 10. The ability
of isozyme-selective inhibitors of PDE5 and 10, as well
as siRNA knockdown to selectively suppress colon tumor
cell growth in a manner similar to ADT-094 suggest that
inhibition of both isozymes mediates the growth inhibitory
activity of ADT-094 [20].
The ability of ADT-094 to selectively inhibit colon
tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis was associated
with increased expression of PDE5 and 10 in colon tumor
cells compared with colonocytes. The elevation of PDE5
and 10 in colon tumor cells is consistent with previous
studies reporting that PDE5 and 10 are overexpressed in
human colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas compared
with normal colonic epithelium as determined by
immunohistochemistry and other methods [14, 21].
ADT-094 inhibition of colon tumor cell growth
is associated with inhibition of proliferation and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induction of apoptosis, which occurred at concentrations
comparable with those necessary for cGMP elevation
and PKG activation. Although PDE10 is a dualsubstrate isozyme, ADT-094 displays a selective effect
on activating PKG without affecting PKA activity at
concentrations that cause growth inhibition of colon
tumor cells. These results are consistent with previous
studies reporting that siRNA knockdown of PDE10
selectively inhibits cGMP hydrolysis without affecting
cAMP hydrolysis in colon tumor cells [21]. This may
be attributed to an abundance of cAMP degrading
isozymes (e.g. PDE4) known to be expressed in colon
tumor cells [12] that could compensate for the effects
of PDE10 inhibition or knockdown on cAMP signaling.
Alternatively, PDE10 is known to have higher affinity
for cAMP (50 nmol/L) than for cGMP (3 μmol/L), but a
five-fold lower Vmax for cAMP compared with cGMP
[41–43]. Therefore, PDE10 may function in cells as a
cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. However, further studies
are necessary to determine if ADT-094 has selective
effects on cGMP signaling that distinguish it from other
PDE10 inhibitors.
Of relevance to our findings of antitumor effect
of the cGMP/PKG pathway, other investigators have
shown the association between cGMP signaling and
colorectal tumorigenesis. For example, a previous study
has shown that guanylyl cyclase (GC)-deficient mice
display increased susceptibility to colon tumorigenesis
[44]. In addition, the GC agonist, uroguanylin, inhibits
tumor formation in the ApcMin/+ mouse model and
increases rates of apoptosis within the tumors [45]. Other
studies indicate that human colon tumor cells transfected
with constitutively active mutants of PKG can undergo
apoptosis and are unable to form colonies [46]. PKG is also
down-regulated in many cancer types including colorectal
cancer, and is important for tumor angiogenesis [47].
We also investigated the potential involvement of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the antineoplastic activity
of ADT-094, given that aberrant up-regulation of this
pathway is common in colorectal cancer patients [48, 49]
and suppression of β-catenin expression and β-catenin/TCF
transcriptional activity has been previously implicated in
the anticancer activity of sulindac [12, 14, 20, 31, 50].
We provide here the first evidence that suppression of
both PDE5 and 10 causes an additive inhibitory effect on
Wnt/β-catenin signaling as compared to inhibiting either
isozyme individually. Furthermore, ADT-094 treatment
can inhibit β-catenin levels and attenuate β-catenin/TCFmediated transcription. These observations are consistent
with reports from other investigators showing that sulindac
metabolites or activators of the cGMP/PKG pathway can
suppress the oncogenic activity of β-catenin [12, 14, 31,
33, 51–53].
The mechanism by which ADT-094 treatment
suppresses the oncogenic activity of β-catenin may be at
the transcriptional level given that β-catenin mRNA levels

and CTNNB1 promoter activity were reduced in colon
tumor cells following knockdown of PDE5 or PDE10 or
by SS treatment [21, 22]. Our observations are consistent
with reports that show activation of PKG can suppress
β-catenin transcription [31], although further studies are
necessary to understand the underlying mechanism by
which PKG inhibits transcription of β-catenin.
In conclusion, dual inhibition of PDE5 and 10 can
suppress colon tumor cell growth through a mechanism
involving elevation of intracellular cGMP levels,
activation of PKG, and attenuation of β-catenin-dependent
TCF transcriptional activity to inhibit proliferation and
induce apoptosis. These findings are significant given the
overexpression of PDE5 and 10 in colon tumor cells that
suggest deficiencies in the cGMP/PKG pathway play an
unrecognized role in tumorigenesis. The selective nature
by which inhibitors suppress tumor cell growth also
suggest the feasibility of targeting PDE5 and 10 for cancer
drug discovery, although further studies are necessary to
determine if there are efficacy or safety advantages in
targeting specific isozymes.

Human colon tumor cell lines, HCT116, HT29,
SW480 and Caco-2 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown under standard cell
culture conditions in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5%
serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
The human colonocyte line, NCM460, that is derived
from normal human colon mucosa [54] was obtained from
INCELL and grown in INCELL’s enriched M3:10 medium
with 10% serum as recommended by supplier. All cell lines
were expanded upon delivery, and numerous aliquots of
low passage cells were preserved in liquid N2. Cells were
passaged no longer than 2 months. Tumor cell lines obtained
from ATCC were characterized by STR profiling as
performed by ATCC. The NCM460 line was characterized
by INCELL as described previously (e.g. tumorigenicity
testing) [54]. No additional re-authentication of the cell
lines was performed except for experimental reasons
(e.g.  confirmation of cell doubling time, morphology,
sensitivity to SS, PDE5/10 expression levels, etc).

siRNA-mediated knockdown

Sulindac sulfide (SS) and papaverine were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, while 1-(3-chlorophenylamino)4-phenylphthalazine (MY5445) was purchased from
BioMol. Recombinant PDE isozymes were purchased
from BPS Biosciences. The PDE10 antibody was
purchased from GeneTex, while the PDE5 antibody
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Nontargeting control siRNA and PDE10 specific siRNAs
were purchased from Qiagen. RNAiMAX transfection
reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. DMSO was used
as vehicle for all compounds unless otherwise noted. All
other reagents were purchased from Sigma.

The PDE10 siRNA target sequence was
5′-GACCGGATCACTAAACCTTAA-3′. For single PDE10
knockdown or PDE5/10 double knockdown study, siRNA
duplexes were transfected into vector control HT29 cells
or stable PDE5 knockdown HT29 cells using RNAiMAX
transfection reagent according to manufacturers’
specifications and incubated at 37°C for 72 hours.

Generation of stable PDE5 knockdown cell line
The stable PDE5 knockdown and vector control
HT29 cells were generated as described previously
[55]. Briefly, The PDE5 siRNA target sequence
was 5′-ATGGAACAAAGGCATTGTGGG-3′.  The
negative
control
siRNA
sequence
was
5′-AAGCGTGGCTGGATGATCACC-3′. The retroviral
supernatant of siRNA from Phoenix-Ampho packaging
cells was incubated with HT29 cells with 5 μl of polybrene
for 24 hours. The stably transfected PDE5 siRNA cells
were selected in 10 μg/ml puromycin for 72 hours before
PDE5 activity, mRNA, and protein levels were evaluated.

Chemical synthesis
ADT-094 was synthesized starting from
4-anisobenzaldehyde. The intermediate product,
6-methoxy-2-methyl-2, 3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one was
treated with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium
chloride and acetic acid to generate 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl1H-inden-3-yl) acetonitrile. Hydrolysis of the nitrile gave
the 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-inden-3-yl) acetic acid.
Reacting of the acid with 3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde
in the presence of sodium methoxide in methanol
resulted
in
(Z)-2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1-(3,
4,
5-trimethoxybenzylidene)-1H-inden-3-yl) acetic acid as
a yellow solid. ADT-094 ((Z)-N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-2(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1-(3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzylidene)1H-inden-3-yl) acetamide) was obtained by an amide
coupling reaction catalyzed by CDI. The final product was
characterized by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy,

COX assay
COX-1 and COX-2 activities were measured using
purified ovine COX-1 and COX-2 with colorimetric assay
kits obtained from Cayman as previously reported [36]. The
activities of COX-1 and COX-2 were measured after the
addition of arachidonic acid and incubation at 25°C for 5 min
by absorbance at 590 nm as specified by the manufacturer.

Growth assay

using the cGMP Direct Biotrak EIA kit (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences). The assay was done according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.

Cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a
density of 5,000 cells per well. For drug treatment, cells
were treated with compound or vehicle, and incubated
at 37°C for 72 hours. All growth assays were performed
in 5% serum unless otherwise noted. Deionized water
was used as vehicle control for papaverine. For siRNA
assays, cells were transfected with siRNA under the same
condition described above. The effect of treatment on cell
growth was measured using the Cell Titer Glo Assay as
specified by the manufacturer (Promega).

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described
previously [13]. Cells were treated with ADT-094 or
vehicle for 8 hours before cell lysates were collected.

Luciferase reporter assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well
in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at
37°C. Cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg TOPFLASH constructs (Millipore) and 0.1 μg β-galactosidaseexpressing vector (Promega). After 24 hours of transfection,
cells were treated with ADT-094 or vehicle for 24 hours. At
the end of treatment, cells were lysed and both luciferase
and β-galactosidase activities were measured using kits
from Promega. All luciferase activity was normalized to
β-galactosidase activity.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a
density of 10,000 cells per well, and allowed to attach
overnight. Cells were treated with ADT-094 or vehicle,
and incubated at 37°C for 6 hours. All apoptosis assays
were done in 5% serum using either tumor cells or
normal colonocytes. The induction of apoptosis caused by
treatment was determined using Caspase 3/7 Glo Assay
(Promega), which is a luminescent assay that measures
substrate cleavage by caspases-3 and -7. The assay was
done according to manufacturer’s specifications.

Quantum-based computational modeling of
PDE5A/10A+ADT-094 complexes
Molecular modeling was performed using the
valence-electron semi-empirical PM6 model [56]
as implemented in the Gaussian09 suite of quantum
chemistry programs (Gaussian, Inc., Rev. C.01). A chargeneutral model of the catalytic site of PDE10A was built
from pdb entry 2OUN (PDE10A+AMP) by selection of
53 residues defining the region. Breaks in the peptide
backbone were terminated with unprotonated amine and
aldehyde functional groups. The bound AMP ligand was
removed, and waters of hydration and a bridge hydroxide
were inserted into the Mg2+, Zn2+ system; the proximal
His525 was protonated, in accord with the results of an
earlier quantum-based study [25]. His525 belongs to a PDEconserved His/Glu tandem, which serves to both prepare
the bridge hydroxide for nucleophilic attack of the cGMP
(cAMP) phosphate diester and to donate a proton to the
GMP (AMP) hydrolyzed product [23, 25]. Other residues
were charged appropriately for pH = 7. PM6 optimization
was carried out to minimize the positions of all added
hydrogen atoms. By the same protocol, a 50-residue model
of the PDE5A catalytic site was built from pdb entry 1TBF
(PDE5A + Viagra). ADT-094 was manually docked within
the PDE5A catalytic site in 7 distinct initial orientations.
Partial PM6 optimizations were then carried out in which
the inhibitor was free to move.

Cell proliferation assay
The antiproliferative activity of ADT-094 was
determined by measuring EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine)
incorporation during DNA synthesis. Cells were plated at
a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 10 cm tissue culture dish
and incubated overnight at 37°C. After growing the cells
in serum-free media overnight, the cells were treated with
ADT-094 or vehicle in medium supplemented with 10%
serum for 6 hours. A final concentration of 10  μmol/L
EdU was added to each dish and incubated for an
additional 18 hours. Cells were harvested and analyzed
using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Proliferation
Assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
specifications. The percentage of proliferating cells was
quantified using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer.

PDE assay
PDE activity was measured using the IMAP
fluorescence polarization (FP) PDE assay (Molecular
Devices) in which binding of hydrolyzed fluorescent
cyclic nucleotide substrate to the IMAP reagent increases
FP as described previously [13].

cGMP assay

Experimental design and statistical analysis

Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per
10 cm tissue culture dish, incubated for 48 hours, and
treated with ADT-094 or vehicle control. After 45 min of
treatment, cells were lysed and assayed for cGMP content
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The IC50 values were determined as described
previously [13]. All experiments were repeated a minimum
of three times to determine the reproducibility of the

results. All error bars represent standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical analysis of differences between samples
was performed using the Student’s t-test. A P  value
of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
