Abstract
Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are critical for cell–cell communication during normal and oncogenic tissue
patterning and tumor growth. Somatic mutation proﬁles of several cancer genomes suggest EphA3 as a tumor
suppressor, but its oncogenic expression pattern and role in tumorigenesis remain largely undeﬁned. Here, we
report unexpected EphA3 overexpression within the microenvironment of a range of human cancers and mouse
tumor xenografts where its activation inhibits tumor growth. EphA3 is found on mouse bone marrow–derived
cells with mesenchymal and myeloid phenotypes, and activation of EphA3þ/CD90þ/Sca1þ mesenchymal/
stromal cells with an EphA3 agonist leads to cell contraction, cell–cell segregation, and apoptosis. Treatment
of mice with an agonistic a-EphA3 antibody inhibits tumor growth by severely disrupting the integrity and
function of newly formed tumor stroma and microvasculature. Our data deﬁne EphA3 as a novel target for
selective ablation of the tumor microenvironment and demonstrate the potential of EphA3 agonists for
anticancer therapy. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4470–81. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The intimate communication between cancer cells and hostderived stromal and myeloid cells (1), which are recruited from
the bone marrow (2) and constitute the vascularized tumor
microenvironment (TME), is critical for primary tumor growth,
invasion, and metastasis (3). Among the proteins considered
instrumental in establishing the TME (1), Ephs and their cellassociated ephrin ligands are implicated in neoangiogenesis and
invasive tumor growth, and are increasingly being recognized as
therapeutic targets entering clinical trials (4).

Ephs RTKs comprise A- and B-type receptors that interact
preferentially with GPI-linked type-A ephrins, and transmembrane type-B ephrins, respectively. Their activation triggers
context- dependent signaling pathways that control cell spreading, adhesion, cell migration, and (stem) cell proliferation. Ephs
function also in the absence of kinase activity, usually with the
opposite outcome, promoting cell-spreading, cell–cell adhesion,
invasion, and supporting stem cell proliferation (5, 6).
Ephs and ephrins are commonly overexpressed in a broad
range of cancers, where their oncogenic roles often reﬂect their
dichotomous developmental activities. Thus, depending on
tumor type and disease stage, overexpressed Ephs can promote
or inhibit tumor progression (7–9). Importantly, oncogenic
Eph expression often coincides with low or absent ephrin
expression and kinase-independent functions (7, 10), whereas
Eph activation by exogenous agonists typically inhibits proliferation, survival, and tumor growth (4, 5).
EphA3 is found in mesenchymal tissues of developing
axial muscles, lung, kidney, and heart (11), is implicated in
mesoderm (12), neural patterning (13), and is essential for
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) during
heart development (14). There is very little evidence for
physiologic adult expression or function, but EphA3 is overexpressed in solid and hematopoietic tumor cells (9, 15–17),
and implicated in maintaining tumor-initiating cells in
glioblastoma (9) and leukemia (18). Frequent somatic mutations of EphA3 in various metastatic cancers are thought to
indicate a tumor suppressor role of the kinase-active receptor (19–22).
We now demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, conspicuous EphA3
expression predominantly in the stromal TME in a broad range
of human solid tumors and mouse tumor xenografts. The

Targeting EphA3 in the Tumor Microenvironment

EphA3-activating mAb IIIA4 (23) targets bone marrow–derived
mesenchymal/stromal and myeloid EphA3þ cells in the tumor
microenvironment, and EphA3þ/CD29þ/CD90þ/Sca1high mesenchymal–stromal/stem cells (MSC) respond to IIIA4 with
EphA3 phosphorylation, rapid cell contraction, and apoptosis.
In xenograft models, IIIA4 treatment signiﬁcantly inhibits
tumor growth by disrupting the overall stromal and vascular
tissue architecture and function.
The prominent expression and function of EphA3 in the
TME but not in normal tissues, together with favorable clinical
properties of the humaneered IIIA4 mAb (KB004) reported
from phase I trials (24), indicate exciting potential therapeutic
opportunities for solid tumor treatment.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents
A list of antibodies and reagents is provided in the Supplementary Data.
Cell lines and culture
Human DU145 (ATCC HTB-81), 22RV1 (ATCC CRL-2505),
and LnCaP (ATCC CRL-1740), and mouse LLC (ATCC CRL1642) are authenticated, karyotyped cell lines from ATCC.
EphA3/293 cells were derived (23) from HEK293T cells (ATCC
CRL-3216) and maintained in DMEM 10% FCS/G418/zeocin,
5% CO2. LIM2550 cells (25), generated at the Ludwig Institute
(Melbourne, Australia), and all ATCC cell lines were maintained in RPMI/10% FCS/10% CO2. Cell lines were kept in
continuous culture for <10 passages and tested (PCR, FACS)
before experimental use for phenotype and expression of
relevant proteins.
Mouse xenografts, antibody treatment, and GFP bone
marrow reconstitution
Animal procedures were according to Monash University
and Austin Hospital Animal Ethics Committee guidelines.
BALB/cnu/nu mice (4–6 weeks, ARC), subcutaneously
injected with 1  107 DU145, 22Rv1, or LIM2550 cells, were
treated by intraperitoneal injection (2/week) of antibodies
or PBS when tumors reached approximately 100 mm3. For bone
marrow transplantation, BALB/cnu/nu mice (4 weeks old), within 48 hours of irradiation (2  5.25 Gy), were intravenously
injected with 1  107 freshly isolated bone marrow cells from
BALB/cnu/nu or GFP transgenic mice [Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J,
Jackson Laboratory], 4 to 6 weeks before tumor xenografting.
Bone marrow cells were depleted by MACS (Miltenyi Biotec)
or FACS from EphA3þ cells using Alexa647chIIIA4; control
bone marrow was prepared by applying unlabeled cells to the
MACS.
Hypoxia measurement
Mice were injected, 30 minutes before analysis, with 60 mg/g
pimidazole (Hypoxyprobe HPI, Inc.), optimum cutting temperature (OCT)-frozen tumor sections analyzed with [FITC]a-pimidizole/[HRP]a-FITC antibodies. Olympus CellSens software was used for quantitation (n  3 mice/group, 10 ﬁelds of
view).

In vivo multiphoton and live cell microscopy
For intravital multiphoton imaging (Leica SP5, 20 Plan
Apo-1.0-NA water lens, 4 external detectors), subcutaneous
tumors were exposed by generating skin ﬂaps through incisions along the ventral midline. Qdot655chIIIA4 (0.025 mg) was
tail vein injected 48 hours before imaging, and 0.1 mL Ricinus
Communis Agglutinin (RCA)-lectin[FITC]; 5 mg/mL] was
added immediately before imaging to label blood vessels
(26). Intrinsic Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signals
were used to reveal collagen ﬁbers (27). To monitor vasculature
integrity, mice were injected 30 minutes before imaging with
0.1 mL [FITC]lectin and 15 mL Qtracker 655.
Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscopes (63 glycerol
objective, NA 1.3) were used for imaging live cells or 4%
PFA-ﬁxed cells.
3D image analysis
Imaris 7.3.1 Software (Bitplane) was used for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and image analysis of 2-photon
microscope Z-stacks (1–5 mm sections). Total ﬂuorescent
isosurfaces and ratios between ﬂuorescent channels were
determined by thresholding of individual channels, volume
rendering of Z-stacks, and applying isosurfaces to thresholded
regions (constant threshold values for all samples in one
experiment). A minimum of 3 to 10 regions, 3 mice per
experiment were analyzed.
Tissue immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy
OCT-embedded fresh-frozen human tissue samples from
surgical biopsies between 1995 and 2007 (Austin Health Tissue
Bank), or from resected tumor xenografts, sectioned (6 mm)
and ﬁxed (10 minutes, acetone) were stained (Vector Labs ABC
Kit), Hematoxylin counterstained and imaged (Olympus DotSlide). GFPþ tumor tissues were ﬁxed in 4% PFA overnight at
4 C and transferred to 30% sucrose overnight before freezing in
OCT and sectioning. For immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
(IFM), directly conjugated primary or secondary antibodies
were used, nuclei counterstained with Hoechst, and imaged on
Leica AF6000 or SP5 microscopes.
2D image analysis
Microscopic images (Leica AF6000, 40 objective) of tumor
sections (10 ﬁelds of view/tumor, 3 mice/group) and
ﬂuorescent live cell images were quantitated (ImageJ) using
thresholded ﬂuorescent channels. ImageJ macros were
adopted into a Kepler workﬂow software (28) for unbiased
quantiﬁcation to threshold and calculate total ﬂuorescent area
per ﬁeld (for tenascin and nuclei) or binarized for particle
detection to count individual vessels per ﬁeld.
Tumor MSC isolation
Single-cell suspensions, ﬁltered (40- and 20-mm sieves) from
Collagenase Type 3/Deoxyribonuclease I (Worthington)digested tumors and treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich), were FACSed (Inﬂux, BD Biosciences) for
EphA3/CD90/Sca-1 expression and sorted cells maintained
(10,000 cells/well, 6-well plate) at 2% O2/5% CO2/37 C in

DMEM/10% FBS/penicillin/streptomycin, leukemia inhibitory
factor (1,000 U/mL; Millipore), EGF (10 ng/mL; Invitrogen),
PDGF (10 ng/mL; Invitrogen). Osteogenic, adipogenic, and
chondrogenic MSC differentiation media were from Invitrogen.
Viability assay
Tumor MSCs were treated as indicated in ﬁgures and
viability assessed by propidium Iodide exclusion. Apoptosis
of adherent cells was imaged using a TUNEL kit (In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit, Roche). MSCs on ﬁbronectin-coated
polystyrene slides were treated as described in the ﬁgure.
Fractions of apoptotic nuclei were determined from "thresholded", binarized ﬂuorescence channels using particle
counting (ImageJ, version 1.46r).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
IIIA4 a-EphA3 mAb (23) immunoprecipitates from (0.15 mg
total protein) tumor cell lysates or frozen tumor homogenates
were Western blotted with indicated antibodies, and actin
blots of total protein lysate (10 mg) were used as a loading
control. Blots were visualized using ECL (Supersignal, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Flow cytometry
A LSRII ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) was used for ﬂow
cytometry, dead cells detected with propidium iodide, and
FLOWJO software (TreeStar) used for raw data analysis and
multivariate compensation.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) were used to
estimate mean  SE, unpaired two-tailed t tests (two variables)
and two-way ANOVA (multiple parameters). For tumor treatments, one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni t test as pairwise
post hoc analysis was used.

Results
Preferential expression of EphA3 in tumor stroma and
vasculature
Compared with other Ephs, the expression proﬁle of EphA3
in tumors has remained poorly characterized. Using the IIIA4
mAb, previously used for the isolation and functional characterization of EphA3 (29–31), our immunohistochemical
expression analysis revealed EphA3-speciﬁc staining in 95%
(154 of 162) of human tumor tissues from a broad range of
cancer types (Supplementary Table S1). a-EphA3 and a-CD31
immunohistochemistry (IHC) of successive tumor tissue sections, and IFM with combinations of IIIA4 and a-CD31 or
a-Vimentin antibodies (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A),
showed that in most cases EphA3 is present in the vascularized
(89%) or stromal (71%) TME (Supplementary Table S1), but less
frequent in tumor cells. Organ-matched nontumor samples
from all patients showed little detectable IIIA4 staining (Fig.
1A, insets; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Indeed, immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis of human tumor cell lines indicated the lack
of EphA3 in all tested colon and lung carcinoma cells, while in
agreement with previous studies (16), several primary melanoma cell lines were EphA3þ (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Also,

analysis of experimental tumors from EphA3 mouse lung
carcinoma (LLC) and human prostate (DU145) and colon
carcinoma cells (LIM2250) indicated EphA3 in tumor lysates,
but not in the corresponding cell lines (Fig. 1B and C). IHC
conﬁrmed a-EphA3 immunoreactivity in areas of the tumor
xenografts that stained with antibodies against stromal and
vascular markers, particularly within the rim of EphA3
(DU145, LIM2550) and EphA3þ 22RV1 tumor xenografts (Fig.
1D). In contrast, nonstromal DU145 tumor tissue, all of the
tested normal adult mouse tissues, and established mouse
endothelial cell lines (not shown) lacked EphA3 expression
(Supplementary Figs. S1C and S2A–S2C).
The chIIIA4 a-EphA3 mAb selectively targets tumor
stroma and vasculature
We studied therapeutic targeting of the EphA3þ tumor
stroma by comparing EphA3þ 22RV1 and EphA3 DU145
prostate carcinoma xenografts, the latter displaying EphA3
stromal and vascular staining reminiscent of that observed in
human prostate carcinomas (Fig. 1A and D and Supplementary
Fig. S1C). For ease of EphA3 detection in these and other
experiments, we used a recombinant chimeric (ch) version of
the IIIA4 mAb (23), where the mouse IIIA4 variable IgG region
is fused to human Igg-1 and Igk constant regions, retaining the
afﬁnity (Supplementary Table S2), speciﬁcity, and tumor-targeting capacity (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C) of mouse IIIA4.
IFM of tumors from chIIIA4-injected mice conﬁrmed its dosedependent accumulation, signiﬁcantly stronger in EphA3þ
22RV1 xenografts than in EphA3 DU145 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C).
We assessed chIIIA4 tumor targeting in vivo, by imaging
subcutaneous Du145 xenografts in mice injected with 655Qdottagged chIIIA4, and with FITC-tagged RCA lectin ([FITC]
lectin) marking blood-perfused vessels (5, 32). Intravital Multiphoton microscopy revealed 655Qdot-chIIIA4 within stromal
tissue and around blood vessels within the tumor (Fig. 2A,
tumor), but not within the adjacent normal mouse skin (Fig.
2A, skin). Confocal microscopy conﬁrmed binding of the
injected chIIIA4 (Fig. 2B), but not of an isotype-matched
control mAb (Fig. 2C), to some CD31þ tumor vessels, whereas
ﬂow cytometry of cell suspensions revealed that 13.6% of the
EphA3þ cells in these tumors (14.2% of total) were also
[FITC]lectinþ (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, confocal microscopy
indicated that also in 22RV1 xenografts, Tenascin-Cþ stromal
cells and some [FITC]lectin-labeled tumor vessels are targeted
by chIIIA4 (Fig. 2E).
EphA3 is expressed on bone marrow–derived MSCs that
promote tumor growth
We next studied the phenotype and tissue origin of EphA3þ
stromal cells. FACS analysis of single-cell suspensions from day
21 (0.2 cm3) DU145 or LIM2550 (not shown) tumors yielded a
population of EphA3þ cells expressing myeloid, MSC, and
endothelial surface markers (Supplementary Fig. S5A). To
isolate tumor stroma–derived cells capable of ex vivo expansion, sorting for EphA3þ/CD90þ/Sca-1Hi cells consistently
yielded a small population of adherent cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5B and C), the only population that allowed propagation

chondrogenic, or adipogenic lineages (Fig. 3B), conﬁrming
their multilineage differentiation potential. Supporting our
conclusion from these experiments that EphA3þ tumor MSCs
are of bone marrow origin, we found elevated levels of EphA3þ
cells in bone marrow and in peripheral blood of tumor-bearing
mice (Supplementary Fig. S5E).
To further assess the bone marrow origin of the EphA3þ
tumor stromal cells, we analyzed tumors from mice that had
received bone marrow transplants from transgenic donor mice
with ubiquitous GFP expression. Flow cytometry of cell suspensions from early (0.2 cm3) tumors revealed a large proportion of EphA3þ cells as part of a tumor-inﬁltrating GFPþ
cell population (Fig. 3C), coexpressing previously assigned cell
surface markers, including CD90, CD105, CD106, CD146, CD34,
and Sca-1 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Notably, MACS depletion
of EphA3þ cells from the donor bone marrow used for adoptive
transfer slowed tumor growth signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3D). To allow
for detection of the bone marrow–derived cells in tumor
xenografts, we generated chimeric GFPþ/EphA3þ bone marrow for adoptive transfer, by replacing the EphA3þ cells in the
donor bone marrow with FACS-isolated transgenic GFPþ/
EphA3þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B and S6C). The tumor
growth rate in mice reconstituted with EphA3-depleted bone
marrow is reduced compared with mice receiving chimeric
donor bone marrow complemented with GFP-EphA3þ cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6D). Analysis of tumors from these mice
revealed matching immunohistochemical proﬁles of GFPþ and
EphA3þ cells, particularly in the tumor rim (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, confocal microscopy of tumor tissue sections revealed
GFP- and EphA3-expressing cells in stromal and perivascular
regions of the tumor, which were absent in tumor sections
from mice transplanted with non-chimeric bone marrow (Fig.
3F). Together, these ﬁndings indicate that EphA3þ bone marrow–derived cells are recruited into the TME and promote
tumor growth.

Tumor MSCs respond to EphA3þ activation by cell
contraction and apoptosis
Because oncogenic Eph expression frequently coincides
with low or absent ephrin expression, while Eph activation is
typically tumor suppressive (7, 10, 35), we explored the
response of tumor-resident MSCs to EphA3 activation. Analysis of DU145 tumors with EphA3-Fc, a fusion protein that
binds EphA3 ligands (36, 37), conﬁrmed lack of EphA3-interacting ephrins in the areas of EphA3 expression and other parts
of the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7C), suggesting that
EphA3 is not ligated in tumor-resident stromal cells.
In vitro activation of Ephs is achieved with preclustered
ephrin-Fc fusion proteins (5, 6), but we also demonstrated
previously that clustered IIIA4 or synergistic binding of IIIA4
and ephrin-A5 Fc triggers EphA3 activation and cellular
responses (23). Thus, while binding of unclustered Alexa647
chIIIA4 to cultured EphA3þ MSCs was barely visible, its
clustering with a-huFc antibodies signiﬁcantly increased the
cell-bound ﬂuorescence and caused pronounced cell contraction (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary Fig. S7D). Confocal and
Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that chIIIA4 clustering, or its
combination with ephrin-A5-Fc, elicits robust EphA3

(Fig. 4D and E). Furthermore, in cocultures of MSCs and DU145
tumor cells, EphA3 activation resulted in a marked dispersion
of MSC cell strands (Supplementary Fig. S7E).
We next assessed whether the treatment of EphA3þ tumor
MSCs with chIIIA4 would affect their viability. Continuous
exposure (48 hours) to preclustered chIIIA4 resulted in a dosedependent decrease in EphA3þ MSC viability (Fig. 4F). Importantly, this effect was not observed with nonclustered chIIIA4
or a clustered control mAb, where TUNEL staining of chIIIA4treated MSCs conﬁrmed apoptosis as the underlying mechanism (Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S7F).

ChIIIA4 treatment inhibits tumor growth and disrupts
the tumor stromal architecture
To assess the effect of EphA3 targeting in vivo, we compared
the therapeutic effect of chIIIA4 treatment on established
xenografts from EphA3-negative (DU145) or EphA3-positive
(22RV1) carcinoma cell lines. Considering that the agonistic
activity of chIIIA4 relies on its preclustering with a-Fc antibodies (23), we initially assessed that clustering of cell-bound
chIIIA4 by Fc-g receptor-mediated binding of mouse effector
cells (monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) would cause
EphA3 activation. Indeed, chIIIA4 bound to peripheral blood
monocytes isolated from BALB/cnu/nu mice in an FcgII/III-

speciﬁc manner (Supplementary Fig. S8A), whereas combined
treatment of EphA3þ MSCs with chIIIA4 and effector cells
caused pronounced EphA3 activation and cell contraction
(Supplementary Fig. S8B).
Importantly, chIIIA4 treatment of the mice caused a dosedependent inhibition of both, 22RV1 and DU145 xenograft
growth (Fig. 5A and B). IHC and IFM of treated tumors
indicated a pronounced disruption of the stromal tumor
architecture, where loss of deﬁned stromal strands resulted
in dispersed tenascin staining (Fig. 5C). Not surprisingly,
chIIIA4 treatment had a dramatic effect on cell viability, and
comparative analysis revealed a signiﬁcant increase in apoptotic cells, particularly in the margin of chIIIA4-treated
tumors (Fig. 5D).
In view of its preferential targeting of the vascularized
TME, we assessed whether the antitumor effect of IIIA4
could be enhanced by combination treatment with bevacizumab, an approved humanized VEGF-neutralizing and

addition of hIIIA4, the humaneered version of chIIIA4 (24),
enhanced the antitumor activity and almost completely
inhibited DU145 xenograft growth at a ratio of 1:10 mg/kg

ChIIIA4 disrupts the architecture and function of tumor
microvessels
We next analyzed the effect of chIIIA4 on the tumor microvasculature. IHC and IFM of tumor sections revealed a significantly reduced microvascular density and frequently collapsed vessels (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S8C and
S8D). We therefore used multiphoton microscopy to monitor
treatment effects on stromal and microvascular integrity in
vivo. Imaging of PBS-treated tumors conﬁrmed prominent
binding of Qdot655-chIIIA4 to [FITC]lectin-labeled tumor
microvessels and to collagen ﬁbers. In contrast, the tumor

discernible collagen ﬁbers, and severely disrupted tumor
microvessels (Fig. 6B), whereas minimal Qdot655chIIIA4 staining suggested that therapeutic chIIIA4 was occupying most of
the EphA3-binding sites (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
We examined the vascular disruption suggested from
these experiments, by using nonconjugated Qdots655
(Qtracker; Invitrogen) to track the blood perfusion in lectin-labeled tumor microvessels after a two-week chIIIA4
treatment. Compared with PBS-treated control mice with
a typical contorted tumor microvasculature, the tumor
microvessels of treated mice were collapsed, unevenly
stained with [FITC]lectin and only partially perfused (Fig.

cantly reduced perfusion of tumor microvessels in chIIIA4treated mice. In agreement with the extensive damage to the
microvessels in the tumor rim suggested from these experiments, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in hypoxic tumor
tissue particularly in the tumor margin, potentially reﬂecting
the reduced oxygenation in regions with compromised
tumor vasculature (Fig. 6D).
ChIIIA4 treatment causes a signiﬁcant reduction in

We next characterized the in vivo response to chIIIA4 in the

vitro, IP/Western blot analysis of tumor lysates revealed that
chIIIA4 treatment leads to transient EphA3 phosphorylation

within tumors 2 hours after injection (Fig. 7A). Interestingly,
after 1 week of chIIIA4 treatment, the overall EphA3 protein
levels in DU145 tumors were notably reduced and did not
reveal detectable EphA3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S8E). We therefore assessed the cell type within
the TME that was mainly targeted by chIIIA4. After 2-week
treatment, we noted a signiﬁcant reduction in the fraction of
EphA3þSca-1þCD90þCD45 cells (Fig. 7C), consistent with
IIIA4 affecting the viability of EphA3þ MSCs in vitro (Fig. 4F
and G). Overall, this resulted in a slight decrease in EphA3þ
cells. In agreement with the effect of chIIIA4 on EphA3þ MSC
viability in vitro and in vivo, and on the overall integrity of the
tumor stroma, IHC of xenograft sections revealed notably
disrupted patterns of stromal (CD90), perivascular (NG2,
smooth muscle actin), and myeloid/macrophage marker proteins in the tumor rim of chIIIA4-treated tumors (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
Eph receptors are implicated in growth and progression of
a large range of cancers (4, 5). We now demonstrate for the
ﬁrst time the prominent expression and function of EphA3
in the TME of tumor xenografts and human sections, but
virtually undetectable expression in normal adult tissues
and organs. We show that bone marrow–derived EphA3þ
stromal cells are recruited into the TME where they contribute to nascent vascular and stromal tissues. Treatment

with chIIIA4, a highly speciﬁc mAb and selective EphA3
agonist (29–31), elicits EphA3 kinase activation, cell contraction, and apoptosis of tumor-resident MSCs, and inhibits
tumor growth by disruption of the architecture and function
of the vascularized TME.
EphA3 activation inhibits tumor growth
Our demonstration that activation of EphA3 with chIIIA4
effectively inhibits tumor growth seems at odds with a range of
reports where its overexpression in various cancers has been
correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis (9, 15–
17). However, Ephs are known for their context-dependent,
dichotomous functions (4, 5): typically, kinase-dormant Ephs
promote cell–cell adhesion, invasion, and tumor (stem cell)
maintenance and are regarded oncogenic (4–6, 39), whereas
Eph kinase activation is tumor suppressive by causing cell–cell
segregation and reduced viability (7, 32, 40). Thus, overexpression of kinase-dormant EphA3 in glioblastoma acts to maintain tumor cells in a dedifferentiated, tumorigenic state,
whereas activation of its kinase inhibits glioma cell proliferation (9). In agreement, our studies suggest that EphA3, overexpressed in tumor MSCs and other stromal cells with a
dormant kinase, functions in the development of the TME
and that its pharmacologic activation results in TME disruption and suppressed tumor growth. Necessarily, this kinasedormant EphA3 function implies the absence of interacting
ephrins, which is in agreement with previous reports,

suggesting exclusive oncogenic overexpression of either Ephs
or ephrins (7, 10). We found no evidence for EphA3-binding
ephrins in the analyzed tumors.
The IIIA4 mAb targets tumor-derived MSCs and disrupts
tumor stromal and vascular integrity
Considering the reported expression of EphA3 in a range of
tumor cells (9, 15–17, 41), the most prominent tumor stromal
EphA3 expression described here is noteworthy. Thus, while
our analysis of human tumor tissues conﬁrmed the previously
reported tumor cell expression in glioblastoma and colon
cancer (9, 41), our survey revealed signiﬁcantly more pronounced and frequent EphA3 expression in the tumor stroma
of all analyzed cancers, a pattern that is consistent with its
involvement in the formation of the TME. Consistent with this
previously unrecognized role, an interim report from ongoing
clinical studies of humaneered IIIA4 (KB004) in leukemias
shows responses in one of the patients that also suggest
targeting of the stromal/ﬁbrotic TME (24).
Our experiments demonstrate EphA3 expression on bone
marrow–derived MSCs and myeloid cell types. Considering the
multilineage potential and phenotypic plasticity of MSCs,
allowing their differentiation into mesenchymal and vascular
lineages, and their direct contribution to adult neovascularization (42, 43), it is tempting to speculate that the EphA3þ
MSCs in our studies may be progenitors for several or all of the
tumor-inﬁltrating stromal cell types. EphA3 was previously
identiﬁed among the hypoxia-regulated genes of human bone
marrow–derived MSCs (44), and the notion of EphA3þ mesenchymal progenitor cells, differentiating within the TME into
different EphA3þ stromal cell populations, concurs with its
embryonic expression on mesodermal (12), vascular, and
mesenchymal tissues (11, 45) and its essential role in EndMT
during heart valve development (14). In support of this premise, we found that bone marrow–derived and tumor-derived
EphA3þ MSCs from tumor-bearing mice have the same phenotypic and pluripotent functional characteristics, and conﬁrmed by adoptive bone marrow transfer the bone marrow
origin of tumor-resident EphA3þ MSCs.
Together with the notable lack of EphA3 expression in nontumor adult tissues, our data suggest EphA3 as a novel marker,
both of MSCs and of tumor stromal tissue. Considering its
developmental role in EndMT (14) and the recently reported
involvement of EphB2 signaling in MSC adhesion, migration,
and differentiation (46), it will be of interest to understand the
potential involvement of EphA3 in MSC mobilization, recruitment into tumors, and multilineage differentiation capacity.
In conclusion, the notable stromal expression of EphA3 in
the vast majority of analyzed human tumor samples and lack of
expression in normal adult tissues, together with the targeting
speciﬁcity and antitumor properties of the chIIIA4 mAb, deﬁne

EphA3 as attractive target for antibody-based anticancer therapies. The promising clinical responses of the humaneered
therapeutic IIIA4 antibody, KB004, in ongoing phase I/II trials
(NCT01211691; ref. 24) therefore suggest immediate therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of solid tumors.
