Abstract

Author Manuscript

Ciclopirox olamine (CPX), an off-patent antifungal agent used to treat mycoses of skin and nails,
has recently been demonstrated to be a potential anticancer agent. However, the underlying
mechanism is not well understood. Here for the first time we show that CPX inhibited
lymphangiogenesis in an in vitro model (tube formation). This effect was in part associated with
inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) expression, as
overexpression of VEGFR-3 conferred partial resistance to CPX inhibitory effect on tube
formation in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked
the effect of CPX, blocking the tube formation. Further study revealed that CPX did not alter
mRNA level, but inhibited protein synthesis and promoted protein degradation of VEGFR-3. In
addition, we found that CPX inhibited phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2), a downstream effector of VEGFR-3. Overexpression of VEGFR-3 attenuated CPX
inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 inhibited
extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in LECs. Ectopic expression of
constitutively active mitogen -activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) resulted in activation of

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Ciclopirox olamine (CPX) ,an off-patent synthetic antifungal agent, has been used topically
to treat fungal and yeast infection of skin or mucosa for more than 20 years (Dittmar et al.,
1973; Jue et al., 1985). Recent studies have shown that CPX induced cell death in primary
human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and inhibited engraftment of primary AML
cells in NOD/SCID mouse models without gross organ toxicity or loss of body weight
(Eberhard et al., 2009). Most recently we have further demonstrated that CPX displayed
anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of
solid tumor cells, such as human rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30), breast carcinoma (MDAMB231), and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells (Zhou et al., 2010). CPX inhibition of
cell proliferation was associated with downregulation of cyclins (A, B1, D1 and E) and
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2 and CDK4), and upregulation of CDK inhibitor p21Cip1,
resulting in hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and consequently slowing down
cell cycle progression from G1/G0 to S phase (Zhou et al., 2010). CPX induction of
apoptosis was mainly related to downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL and
survivin) and increased cleavage of Bcl-2. These findings suggest that CPX is a potential
antitumor agent.
Lymphangiogenesis, like angiogenesis, plays an important role in promoting tumor growth
and metastasis (Mandriota et al., 2001; Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al., 2001; Karpanen
and Alitalo, 2008).Targeting lymphatic system is a promising strategy for treatment or
prevention of tumor growth and metastasis (Pepper, 2001; Cueni and Detmar, 2006). Studies
have shown that CPX inhibits angiogenesis in human endothelial cells (Clement et al.,
2002), although this remains controversial (Linden et al., 2003). To our knowledge, the
effect of CPX on lymphangiogenesis has not been reported, which prompted us to study
whether CPX possesses anti-lymphangiogenic activity.

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), also known as fms-like tyrosine
kinase 4 (Flt-4), is primarily expressing on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)
(Kaipainen et al., 1995). Ligand (VEGF-C/D) binding activates VEGFR-3, leading to
activation of the downstream signaling molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Karpanen and Alitalo, 2008;
Mandriota et al., 2001; Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al., 2001; Wissmann and Detmar,
2006). VEGFR-3 signaling plays a critical role in LEC survival and lymphangiogenesis (8),
as well as metastasis (Mandriota et al., 2001; Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al., 2001). Thus,
targeting VEGFR-3 pathway is a potential strategy for cancer prevention and treatment.

The study of lymphangiogenesis has been impeded by the difficulties in the isolation and
propagation of LECs from different organs (Makinen et al., 2001; Nisato et al., 2004). To
overcome the above limitations, we selected a ‘conditionally immortalized’ line of murine
LECs, which express SV40 large T and retain their “lymphatic” endothelial characteristics
after repeated passages (Ando et al., 2005). LECs in vitro culture still remain the ability to
sprout, elongate, migrate, and reorganize to form a tube structure within 2-3 h, a process
called tube formation, and this reflects key aspects and represents a crucial process of
lymphangiogenesis (Fang et al., 2009). We thus used this LEC tube formation model, a
simple and reproducible approach, to study the effect of CPX on lymphangiogenesis in vitro.
Our results reveal that CPX inhibited LEC tube formation, which was at least attributed to
inhibition of protein expression of VEGFR-3 and phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

CPX inhibits LEC tube formation

Author Manuscript

Studies have shown that CPX inhibits angiogenesis (Clement et al., 2002), although this is
controversial (Linden et al., 2003). To further unveil whether CPX inhibits
lymphangiogenesis, we chose murine LEC tube formation as an in vitro model for
lymphangiogenesis. Treatment with CPX (0-5 μM) for 24 h did not obviously influence
LEC cell viability according to cell morphology (Fig.1A, Bottom panel), but resulted in a
concentration-dependent inhibition of LEC tube formation (Fig.1A, Upper panel). At 2.5
and 5 μM, CPX inhibited the tube formation by approximately 70% and 90%, respectively,
comparing with the control group (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, CPX (5 μM) inhibited LEC tube
formation in a time-dependent manner as well (Fig. 1B, Bottom panel), despite no apparent
effect on cell viability (Fig.1B, Upper panel). After treatment for 4 h, CPX (5 μM) was able
to significantly block the tube formation (by ~20%). When LECs were treated with CPX (5
μM) for 24 h, the tube formation was inhibited by ~90%, comparing with the control group
(Fig. 1D).
CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation is associated with suppressing VEGFR-3 protein
expression

Author Manuscript

Since VEGFR-3 is primarily expressed in LECs (13), and essential for lymphangiogenesis
(Karpanen and Alitalo, 2008; Mandriota et al., 2001; Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al.,
2001), we investigated whether CPX inhibits LEC tube formation by targeting VEGFR-3.
When LECs were exposed to CPX for 24 h, a pronounced reduction of protein expression of
VEGFR-3 was detected at 1-5 μM by Western blot analysis (Fig.2A). When the cells were
treated with CPX at 5 μM, a time-dependent inhibition of VEGFR-3 expression was also
observed. Treatment with CPX for 8 h markedly reduced VEGFR-3 level. Prolonged
treatment with CPX resulted in more reduction of VEGFR-3 (Fig.2B).
To determine the role of VEGFR-3 in CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation, LEC cells
(LEC/VEGFR-3) stably overexpressing VEGFR-3 were generated by transfection with
p3×Flag-VEGFR-3-TV1 plasmid. In comparison with the control cells (LEC/V) transfected
with the empty vector, approximately 3-fold increase of VEGFR-3 protein expression was
detected in LEC/VEGFR-3 cells (Fig. 2C). Treatment with CPX (5 μM) for 24 h reduced

protein expression of VEGFR-3 by ~90% (Fig. 2C), and consequently inhibited the tube
formation by ~90% in LEC/V cells (Fig.2D). When LEC/VEGFR-3 cells were treated with
CPX (5 μM) for 24 h, VEGFR-3 protein expression was downregulated by ~50%, but the
VEGFR-3 protein level was still slightly higher than the basal level in the control (LEC/V)
cells (Fig. 2C). Of interest, overexpression of VEGFR-3 significantly increased the tube
formation and conferred high resistance to CPX inhibition of the tube formation (Fig. 2D),
suggesting that CPX inhibits LEC tube formation in part by suppressing VEGFR-3 protein
expression.

Author Manuscript

To further confirm the role of VEGFR-3 in CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation, RNA
interference technology was applied. Infection with lentiviral shRNA to VEGFR-3 silenced
the protein expression of VEGFR-3 by ~90%, comparing with the controls infected with
lentiviral shRNA to GFP (control) (Fig.3A). Downregulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked the
effect of CPX, inhibiting the tube formation by ~90%. Under this condition, no synergistic
or additive inhibitory effect on the tube formation was observed by treatment with CPX
(Fig.3B). However, when LECs were infected with half amount of the lentiviral shRNA, and
VEGFR-3 protein expression was downregulated by ~50% (Fig.3C), a synergistic inhibitory
effect on the tube formation was observed in combination with 2.5 μM CPX treatment (Fig.
3D). This is evidenced by the findings that half amount of VEGR-3 shRNA or CPX (2.5
μM) alone inhibited LEC tube formation by approximately 42% and 45%, respectively,
whereas a combination treatment inhibited LEC tube formation by ~65% (Fig.3D). The
results suggest that CPX may have a potential to synergize the anti-lymphangiogenic effects
of VEGFR-3 inhibitors.

CPX inhibits protein expression of VEGFR-3 by inhibiting protein synthesis and promoting
protein degradation of VEGFR-3 in LECs
CPX inhibition of protein expression of VEGFR-3 may occur at transcriptional, translational
and/or post-translational level. To this end, firstly, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was employed
to determine whether CPX affects VEGFR-3 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.4A, there
was no any apparent change of the mRNA level, regardless of treatment with CPX at 0-5
μM 24 h or at 5 μM for 0-24 h. This was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR (qRTPCR) as well (see supplemental data, Fig.1S).

Author Manuscript

Next, 35S-Met/Cys labeling was used to determine whether CPX impacts VEGFR-3 protein
synthesis. After LECs, pretreated with CPX at 0-5 μM 24 h or at 5 μM for 0-24 h, were
pulsed with 35S-Met/Cys for 4 h, autoradiography revealed that pretreatment with CPX at
2.5-5 μM for 24 h inhibited incorporation of 35S-Met/Cys into VEGFR-3 by ~50-70%, and
pretreatment with CPX at 5 μM for 12-24 h suppressed incorporation of 35S-Met/Cys into
VEGFR-3 by ~70%, comparing with the controls (Fig.4B).
Furthermore, to determine whether CPX influences protein degradation of VEGFR-3, LECs,
grown in 10% FBS-DMEM medium, were exposed to cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml), an
inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis by preventing initiation and elongation on 80S
ribosomes, in the presence or absence of CPX (5 μM), for up to 12 h, followed by Western
blot analysis. It appeared that CPX treatment remarkably promoted VEGFR-3 protein turnover rate. As illustrated in Fig.4C, considerable level of VEGFR-3 protein was still

detectable when the cells were treated with CHX alone for 8 h. However, a very low level of
VEGFR-3 protein was observed when the cells were treated with CHX + CPX only for 4 h.
Collectively, our data indicate that CPX did not alter mRNA level, but inhibited protein
synthesis and promoted protein degradation of VEGFR-3, thereby inhibiting protein
expression of VEGFR-3 in LECs.
CPX inhibits LEC tube formation by targeting VEGFR-3-mediated ERK1/2 pathway

Author Manuscript

PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways are the two major downstreams of VEGFR-3 (Wissmann
and Detmar, 2006). We hypothesized that CPX inhibits LEC tube formation through
targeting these pathways. To our surprise, when LECs were treated with CPX (0-5 μM) for
24 h or 5 μM for 0-24 h, PI3K/Akt pathway was not affected. This is evidenced by the
findings that CPX failed to alter protein expression or phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.5A,B).
Treatment with CPX did not obviously affect cellular protein expression or phosphorylation
of JNK and p38 MAPK either, but dramatically inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
despite no effect on total protein levels of ERK1/2 (Fig.5A,B), suggesting a selective
inhibition of the ERK pathway in the LECs.
To examine whether CPX inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is due to inhibition of
VEGFR-3 protein expression, LEC/VEGFR-3 and LEC/V cells were treated with CPX (5
μM) for 24 h. By Western blot analysis, overexpression of VEGFR-3 upregulated
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and conferred high resistance to CPX inhibition of
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig.5C). In contrast, downregulation of VEGFR-3 by lentiviral
shRNA mimicked the effect of CPX, reducing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig.5D). The
results support the notion that CPX inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is a consequence
of downregulation of VEGFR-3 protein expression.

To determine whether CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation is really attributed to
inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway, we generated recombinant adenoviral vector (Ad-MKK1R4F) expressing Flag-tagged constitutively active MKK1, which activates ERK1/2
(Mansour et al., 1994). As seen in Fig.6A, Flag-MKK1 was expressing in the LECs infected
with Ad-MKK1-R4F, but not Ad-GFP (control). Furthermore, ectopic expression of
constitutively active MKK1 induced a robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in LECs.
Treatment with CPX (5 μM) for 24 h inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both Ad-GFP
infected (control) and Ad-MKK1-R4F infected cells. However, the level of phosphoERK1/2 in Ad-MKK1-R4F infected cells treated with CPX was comparable to the basal
level in the control cells (Fig.6A). Noticeably, expression of constitutively active MKK1,
but not GFP, rendered high resistance to CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation (Figure.6B).
As a control, U0126 (a selective inhibitor of MKK1/2, upstream of ERK1/2) was utilized.
We found that U0126 (5μM) alone inhibited phospho-ERK1/2 and LEC tube formation
profoundly (Fig.6C,D). In combination, CPX (5 μM) did not enhance U0126 inhibition of
the tube formation (Fig.6D), although more inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2 was seen (Fig.
6C). The results suggest that CPX inhibits LEC tube formation through targeting VEGFR-3mediated ERK pathway.

Discussion
Recent studies have shown that CPX, a fungicide used to treat mycoses of skin and nails for
over two decades, also inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancer cells in
culture and in xenografts in mice (Eberhard et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010). Here, for the
first time, we further show that CPX inhibited murine LEC tube formation, an in vitro
lymphangiogenesis model. This is consistent with the findings that CPX inhibited human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation, an in vitro angiogenesis model
(Clement et al., 2002). It is widely accepted that lymphangiogenesis, like angiogenesis, is
crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Pepper, 2001; Wissimann and Detmar, 2006).
Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that CPX is a potential anticancer agent.

VEGFR-3 is a transmemberane receptor tyrosine kinase in LECs and activated by binding of
the ligands, VEGF-C and D (Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al., 2001). Activation of the
VEGFR-3 signaling pathway is recognized to play an important role in tumor growth and
metastasis by promoting lymphangiogenesis, and disruption of this pathway is a current
strategy for the development of anticancer drugs (He et al., 2002; Karpanen et al.,
2001;2006; Lin et al., 2005; Makinen et al., 2001; Ruggeri et al., 2003). Here we identified
that CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation is attributed to suppressing VEGFR-3 protein
expression. This is supported by the observations that i) CPX inhibited VEGFR-3 protein
expression; ii) overexpression of VEGFR-3 conferred high resistance to CPX inhibition of
LEC tube formation; and iii) downregulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked the effect of CPX,
blocking LEC tube formation. These data are in agreement with previous findings that
blocking VEGFR-3 signaling alone by VEGFR-3 fusion protein (Karpanen et al., 2001;
2006), VEGFR-3 soluble form (Lin et al., 2005; Makinen et al., 2001), or small-molecule
inhibitors of VEGFR-3 (He et al., 2003; 2005; Ruggeri et al., 2003) inhibited
lymphangiogenesis. It should be mentioned that we failed to detect VEGF-C/D in LECs
even without CPX treatment (data not shown). This is consistent with the notion that VEGFs
are generally produced and secreted by tumor cells, but not by the vascular or lymphatic
endothelial cells (Alitalo and Carmeliet, 2002; Kerbel and Kamen, 2004). The results further
support that CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation in our model was not through affecting
VEGF-C/D expression, but is primarily through blocking VEGFR-3 protein expression.
However, we also noticed that overexpression of VEGFR-3 failed to rescue the tube
formation inhibited by CPX completely (Fig.2D), suggesting that CPX inhibits LEC tube
formation involving more signaling molecules. More studies are needed to address this
issue.

CPX has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis by blocking proline hydroxylation and
maturation of collagen in HUVEC cells (Clement et al., 2002), but it has also been described
to stimulate angiogenesis by inducing expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α and VEGF
in human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells (Linden et al., 2003). Our preliminary studies
indicate that treatment with CPX (5-10 μM, 24 h) downregulated protein expression of
VEGF-C in prostate (PC-3) and breast (MDA-MB231) carcinoma cells (data not shown),
which is in contrast to the findings in HepG2 cells. Probably this is due to the difference in
cell lines or experimental conditions used. Further studies are needed to determine whether

CPX inhibits lymphangiogenesis in vivo by inhibiting both VEGFR-3 protein expression in
LECs and VEGF-C/D expression in tumor cells.

Studies have shown that CPX affects expression of iron permeases or transporters (FTR1,
FTR2, FTH1), a copper permease (CCC2), an iron reductase (CFL1), and a siderophore
transporter (SIT1) in the fungus Candida albicans ( Niewerth et al., 2003; Sigle et al., 2005),
HIF-1α and VEGF in mammalian cells at transcriptional level (Linden et al., 2003). In this
study, we found that CPX inhibited protein expression of VEGFR-3 in LECs. Therefore, we
hypothesized that CPX inhibits VEGFR-3 protein expression by downregulating its mRNA
level in LECs. However, unexpectedly, CPX did not alter VEGFR-3 mRNA level. Instead,
CPX inhibited protein synthesis and promoted protein degradation of VEGFR-3 in the
LECs. The results suggest that CPX may affect expression of different proteins through
distinct mechanisms, and CPX controls VEGFR-3 protein expression at translational and
post-translational levels.

It has been described that VEGFR-3 activates PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and JNK pathways
(Wissmann and Detmar, 2006), promoting cell proliferation, migration and survival
(Dixelius et al., 2003; Fournier et al., 1999; Salameh et al., 2005; Su et al., 2006). Here we
found that CPX did not affect either cellular protein or phosphorylation levels of Akt, JNK
and p38 MAPK, but potently inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in murine LECs,
suggesting that the effects of CPX on these signaling pathways are cell-dependent.
Furthermore, we identified that CPX inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was a
consequence of downregulation of VEGFR-3 protein expression, since overexpression of
VEGFR-3 attenuated CPX inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2, whereas downregulation of
VEGFR-3 mimicked the effect of CPX, reducing phospho-ERK1/2 in the LECs. In addition,
we also observed that expression of constitutively active MKK1 increased phospho-ERK1/2
and rendered high resistance to CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation. Selective
suppression of ERK1/2 by U0126 (5 μM) directly blocked LEC tube formation by ~90%. In
combination, CPX (5 μM) did not additively or synergistically enhance the inhibitory effect
of U0126 (5 μM) on the tube formation, implying that ERK pathway is a critical controller
for the LEC tube formation, and U0126 (5 μM) and CPX (5 μM) may redundantly inhibit
ERK activation. We have not tested whether at lower concentrations, U0126 and CPX have
any synergistic or additive inhibitory effect on tube formation. However, we noticed that
expression of constitutively active MKK1 only conferred partial resistance to VEGFR-3
shRNA inhibition of LEC tube formation. In line with the observation shown in Fig.3B,
downregulation of VEGFR-3 by 90% resulted in 10% LEC tube formation, whereas
expression of MKK1-R4F in the VEGFR-3 shRNA-treated cells, about 40% LEC tube
formation could be detected (data not shown). The results suggest that in addition to
ERK1/2, there may be other signaling molecules involved in the VEGFR-3-mediated the
tube formation in LECs as well. Our data are consistent with the recent findings that
activation of ERK pathway promotes lymphoangiogenesis (Fritz-Six et al., 2008; Jin et al.,
2008; Ming et al., 2009). Taken together, the results indicate that CPX inhibition of LEC
tube formation at least partially through inhibition of VEGFR-3-mediated ERK1/2 pathway.
In summary, we have shown that CPX inhibited LEC tube formation in a concentration and
time-dependent manner. CPX inhibition of the LEC tube formation was related to

suppression of VEGFR-3 protein expression, which occurred at translational and posttranslational levels. Furthermore, our data suggest that CPX inhibition of LEC tube
formation was in part by targeting VEGFR-3-mediated ERK pathway, and CPX may act as a
novel anti-lymphangiogenic agent. The findings may facilitate repurposing the off-patent
drug CPX for cancer therapy.

Lentiviral shRNA cloning, production and infection

To generate lentiviral shRNA to VEGFR-3, oligonucleotides containing the target sequences
were synthesized, annealed and inserted into FSIPPW lentiviral vector (Kanellopoulou et al.,
2005) (a gift from Dr. Jun Chung, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center,
Shreveport, LA) through the EcoR1/BamH1 restriction enzyme site. The oligonucleiotides
used were: VEGFR-3 sense: 5′AATTCCCGCACTGCCACAAGAAGTACTGCAAGAGAGTACTTCTTGTGGCAG
TGCTTTTTG-3′, antisense: 5′-GATCCAAAAAGCACTGCCACAAGAAGTACTCTCTT
GCAGTACTTCTTGTGGCAGTGCGGG-3′. Lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting green
fluorescence protein (GFP, as control) and VEGFR-3 were made as described (Liu et al.,
2006). Subsequently, LEC cells, when grown to about 70% confluence, were infected with
the above lentiviral shRNAs in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene, and exposed to 2 mg/ml
puromycin after 24 h of infection. In 5 days, cells were used for experiments.

Cell morphological analysis

Author Manuscript

LECs were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Next day, the cells
were treated with CPX (0-5 μM) for 24 h, or with 5 μM CPX for 0-24 h, followed by taking
images with an Olympus inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus Optical C.,
Melviller, NY, USA) (200×) equipped with the Quick Imaging system.
Tube formation assay
Tube formation assay was performed as described (Schacht et al., 2003). Briefly, LECs were
harvested after indicated treatments, and then seeded into a 96-well plate (2 × 104/well) precoated with 40 μl (10 mg/ml) growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences, Billerica,
MA, USA). After 2-3 h incubation at 37°C, the capillary tube structures were observed and
representative images were captured with an Olympus inverted phase-contrast microscope
(Olympus Optical C., Melviller, NY, USA) (200×) equipped with the Quick Imaging
system. Tube length was quantified by NIH Image J.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total mRNA was extracted from LECs using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) following the
manufacture’s instruction. cDNA was constructed using MML-VII reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using 10 ng
cDNA, Tag DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and specific
primer pairs for VEGFR-3 and β-actin (as internal control), respectively. The forward primer
set for VEGFR-3 is: 5′-CAGGATGAAGACA TTTGAGGA-3; and the backward primer is:
5′-TGAAGCCGCTTTC TTGTCTATG-3; the forward primer set for β-actin is: 5′-

TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCAT; and the backward primer is: 5′CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGT GGACGATGGA GGG. The amplification was done for 30
cycles (94°C 30s, 60°C 30s, and 72°C 40s). PCR products were size-fractionated on 2%
agarose gels and visualized on a UV transilluminator.
Protein synthesis and degradation assay

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of CPX on protein synthesis of VEGFR-3, in vivo 35S-Met/Cys
labeling (Sunavala-Dossabhoy et al., 2004) was used. Briefly, LECs grown in 100-mm
dishes in the growth medium were pretreated with CPX (0-5 μM) for 24 h or for 0-24 h at 5
μM. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS twice, switched to 3 ml Met/Cys-free
DMEM (Mediatech) containing 10 μM MG-132 (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA), a
proteasome inhibitor, and then pulsed with 0.3 mCi/ml 35S-Met/Cys (MP Biomedicals,
Solon, OH, USA) for up to 4 h, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodes to
VEGFR-3 and GAPDH (as control), respectively, in the presence of proteinA/G agarose
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were harvested,
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.22 μm PVDF membrane (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and then exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography.
To determine the effect of CPX on protein degradation, LECs were grown in the growth
medium and treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) with or without CPX (5
μM) for 0-12 h. Subsequently, cell lysates were collected, followed by Western blot analysis
with antibodies to VEGFR-3 and β-tubulin (as control), respectively.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Results were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (mean ± SD). The data were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Dunnett’s t-test
for multiple comparisons. A level of P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
