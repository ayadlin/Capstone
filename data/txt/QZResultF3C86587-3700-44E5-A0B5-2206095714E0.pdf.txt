Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Regular use of aspirin reduces incidence and mortality of various cancers, including colorectal
cancer. Anti-cancer effect of aspirin represents one of the “Provocative Questions” in cancer
research. Experimental and clinical studies support a carcinogenic role for PTGS2
(cyclooxygenase-2), which is an important enzymatic mediator of inflammation, and a target of
aspirin. Recent “Molecular Pathological Epidemiology” (MPE) research has shown that aspirin
use is associated with better prognosis and clinical outcome in PIK3CA-mutated colorectal
carcinoma, suggesting somatic PIK3CA mutation as a molecular biomarker that predicts response
to aspirin therapy. The PI3K enzyme plays a pivotal role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
Activating PIK3CA oncogene mutations are observed in various malignancies including breast
cancer, ovarian cancer, brain tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and colon cancer. The
prevalence of PIK3CA mutations increases continuously from rectal to cecal cancers, supporting
the “colorectal continuum” paradigm, and an important interplay of gut microbiota and host
immune/inflammatory reaction. MPE represents an interdisciplinary integrative science,
conceptually defined as “epidemiology of molecular heterogeneity of disease”. Because exposome
and interactome vary from person to person and influence disease process, each disease process is
unique (the unique disease principle). Hence, MPE concept and paradigm can extend to nonneoplastic diseases including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, etc.

MPE research opportunities are currently limited by paucity of tumor molecular data in existing
large-scale population-based studies. However, genomic, epigenomic, and molecular pathology
testing (e.g., analyses for microsatellite instability, MLH1 promoter CpG island methylation, and
KRAS and BRAF mutations in colorectal tumors) is becoming routine clinical practice. In order for
integrative molecular and population science to be routine practice, we must first reform education
curricula by integrating both population and molecular biologic sciences. As consequences, nextgeneration hybrid molecular biological and population scientists can advance science, moving
closer to personalized precision medicine and health care.

Introduction: Aspirin as Anti-Cancer Drug

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epidemiologic studies as well as evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that
regular use of aspirin reduces incidence of cancers including colorectal cancer,1-10 and that
regular use of aspirin after colorectal cancer diagnosis improves patient outcomes.9-16
Experimental data also highlight an oncogenic role for PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2), enzyme
central to the inflammatory response and a primary target of aspirin.11,17-22 However,
beyond the anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin and its influence on PTGS2, the mechanisms
underlying improved outcome associated with regular aspirin use remain unclear.
Mechanisms of anti-cancer effect of aspirin represent one of the “Provocative Questions” in
cancer research.23,24
Colorectal Cancer: Heterogenous Diseases

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Colorectal cancers consist of a group of heterogenous disorders with diverse sets of genetic
and epigenetic changes which accumulate during the carcinogenesis process.25-29 Genomic
and epigenomic analyses of colorectal cancer have revealed enormous heterogeneity of the
disease.30-38 In addition, molecular features and behavior of tumor cells are influenced by
host immunity and inflammation39-46 as well as by exposome (a totality of exposures from
environment) and interactome (a totality of interactions of various molecules).47 Evidence
also suggests variability and continuum of functions of oncogenes, tumor suppressors and
passenger genes/mutations.47-52 This vast array of influences on both the initiation as well as
progression of colorectal cancers poses a significant challenge to accurately predict the
clinical behavior of any given tumor. Essentially, each tumor goes through its own unique
pathway to cancer and ultimate killing of host.47 If pathway A (to tumor A) is similar to
pathway B (to tumor B) but not to pathway C (to tumor C), we can classify tumors A and B
into one subtype, and tumor C into another subtype, using tumor biomarker(s). Tumor
biomarkers can help classify molecularly-similar cancers into one subtype or another, to
better predict their behaviors and response to therapy.47 Thus, molecular testing of tumors
has grown increasingly routine in clinical settings.53-58 In addition to inter-tumor
heterogeneity, intratumor heterogeneity adds another layer of complexity,59 which can not

only lead to heterogeneous biological behavior, but also a practical issue in tumor molecular
testing.

Activating mutations in PIK3CA (official HGNC ID: HGNC:8975, phosphatidylinositol-4,5bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) are present in many cancer types including
colorectal cancer. The prevalence of PIK3CA exon 9 and/or exon 20 hotspot mutations in
colorectal cancers is approximately 15-20% in large population-based studies,60-62 and more
variable in clinical trials63-67 and other studies.68-82 Studies which used Pyrosequencing
assay60,83,84 (which is more sensitive than Sanger sequencing85) generally show higher
frequencies of PIK3CA mutations than Sanger sequencing studies.61,62,69,80,86 Considering
mutations in other less-commonly mutated exons as well as false negativity in molecular
assays (particularly, Sanger sequencing), it is estimated that approximately 20% of
colorectal cancers in the general population harbor PIK3CA mutations. Interestingly, the
prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer increases continuously from rectum
(approximately 10%) to cecum (approximately 25%),62,87 supporting the “colorectal
continuum” paradigm,88 and an important interplay of gut microbiota and host
response.39,89-93PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer is associated with phosphorylated
AKT expression,94, phosphorylated RPS6 expression,83 inactive CTNNB1 status,83 VDR
(vitamin D receptor) expression,95 and KRAS mutations,60,62,83,96 including codon 61 and
146 mutations.50PIK3CA G>A substitutions are associated with loss of MGMT mismatch
repair enzyme.62,83 Associations of PIK3CA mutations with other molecular features such as
microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and BRAF
mutations are less consistent.60-62,65,71,83PIK3CA amplification has also been
reported.97PIK3CA mutation may predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in stage IV
colorectal cancer.63,86,98-100 A prognostic role of overall PIK3CA mutation status in
colorectal cancer remains uncertain;60,65 however, the presence of coexisting exon 9 and
exon 20 mutations may be associated with shorter patient survival,60 which is supported by
experimental data.101
Colorectal Cancer PIK3CA Mutation Predicts Response to Aspirin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently, Liao et al.102 tested the hypothesis that aspirin might be effective specifically on
PIK3CA-mutated colorectal cancer, based on experimental evidence for an interplay of the
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase) and PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2)
pathways.19,103,104 The study demonstrated that the effect of aspirin use on patient survival
appeared significantly stronger in PIK3CA-mutated cancer than in PIK3CA-wild-type
cancer.102 These findings not only highlight the potential cross-talk between the PI3K and
PTGS2 pathways, but also suggest PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer as a potential
biomarker to predict response to aspirin therapy.102,105,106
Possible Mechanisms of Interaction between Aspirin and Tumor PIK3CA Mutation
The study by Liao et al.102 demonstrated strong interactive effects of aspirin and tumor
PIK3CA mutation in a late phase of tumor progression, while the frequencies of tumor
PIK3CA mutations were similar in both tumors that arose in aspirin users compared with
non-users prior to diagnosis. These data imply that the interactive effect of aspirin and tumor
PIK3CA mutation evolves as a tumor develops and progresses. The data also suggest

important roles of exposures (including drug) and the tumor microenvironment in modifying
a tumor phenotype (Figure 1). Recent evidence attests to the plasticity of BRAF-mutated
melanoma cells which is conferred by secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from
stromal cells, leading to tumor resistance to targeted RAF inhibitor therapy.107 In colorectal
carcinogenesis, changes in the local tumor microenvironment may also be related to the
biogeography of the colon, which could in turn reflect variation in the gut microbiome, an
increasingly important area of investigation.
Accumulating evidence implies a role for gut microbiota and contents in the immune
response and carcinogenesis.89-91 In parallel, a recent provocative study showed that the
prevalence of major molecular events in colorectal cancer (including PIK3CA and BRAF
mutations, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype) appears to
increase gradually along detailed subsites from rectum to ascending colon.87 These data
challenge the existing dichotomy model of proximal vs. distal colorectum in terms of the
molecular features.87,88 Taken together, it is possible that the effect of aspirin on the local
microenvironment and its interaction with tumor PIK3CA mutation may change according to
gut microbiota, contents, and biogeography.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An alternative mechanism for the interaction between aspirin and tumor PIK3CA mutation
may relate to platelet function and tumor thrombosis. The well-characterized anti-platelet
effects of aspirin are evident even with low dose of the drug. Distant tumor metastasis
consists of a complex process of tumor cell invasion into stroma and vascular wall, survival
in the bloodstream, formation of tumor thrombus, attachment of vascular wall at a metastatic
site, and tumor cell invasion of the vascular wall into stroma at the metastatic site. Thus,
given the central role of thrombosis in tumor metastasis, it is quite plausible that an
influence of aspirin on tumor metastatic potential and patient outcomes may be mediated by
its anti-platelet effects, which could in turn differ according to PIK3CA mutation status.
What's Next?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the intriguing observation by Liao et al.102 what should we do next? First, these
findings require validation in independent datasets. Although additional observational and
interventional studies would be valuable,108 only a few cohorts have collected detailed longterm data on aspirin use and characterized a substantial number of tumors for PIK3CA
mutation. Beyond observational cohort studies, several clinical trials of aspirin as well as the
PTGS2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor celecoxib for colorectal cancer patients are underway.
Within these studies, the interactive effect of aspirin (or celecoxib) and tumor PIK3CA
mutation can be examined. A distinct effect for celecoxib and tumor PIK3CA mutation
compared with that for aspirin would support an anti-cancer effect of aspirin mediated
through platelets since celecoxib does not appear to significantly inhibit platelets.
Beyond human studies, additional experimental models may be useful to test an interactive
effect of aspirin and tumor PIK3CA mutation with the caveat that the local
microenvironment in human tumors likely differs from in vitro and animal models.
Thus, for future human correlative studies or experimental systems, it will be increasingly
necessary to assess the exposome (a totality of exposures) and interactome (a totality of

interactions between various molecules in the local microenvironment). Both molecular
pathological epidemiology (MPE) and systems biology109 approaches consider network
perturbations beyond a single exposure – molecular pathway interaction in isolation.110
Molecular Pathological Epidemiology (MPE): Integrative Science Enables the Discovery

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The study by Liao et al.102 represents a prototypical example of “Molecular Pathological
Epidemiology (MPE)” research, which has emerged as the transdisciplinary integration of
molecular pathology and epidemiology.43,111,112 The term and concept of MPE have been
gaining popularity worldwide.13,92,113-134 Conceptually, MPE is defined as “epidemiology
of molecular heterogeneity of disease (both intra-individual and inter-individual)”. Hence,
MPE differs from conventional epidemiology where a given disease (eg, colon cancer) is
regarded as a single entity without explicit consideration of inherent disease
heterogeneity.135 A similar concept of “etiologic heterogeneity” has also been used.136,137
While much of MPE data have been derived from neoplastic diseases, the MPE design and
paradigm can be applied to research of non-neoplastic conditions.110 Using MPE design, we
can examine interactions between influences of exogenous factors (eg, aspirin use and
smoking status) and molecular alterations in cancer (eg, PIK3CA mutation and BRAF
mutation), which affect cancer cell behavior.11,102,105,138-140 Thus, much beyond
conventional epidemiology research, MPE not only enables further insights into disease
development and progression, but also provides potential disease biomarkers which can
predict response or resistance to lifestyle or pharmacological intervention.43,112 With
conventional epidemiology design, the potential predictive value of PIK3CA mutation in
colorectal cancer for response to aspirin could not have been uncovered.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Currently, it requires enormous resources, time and effort to build a database of tumor
molecular pathology to make MPE research a reality. Comprehensive database is necessary
to assess not only tumor markers, but also various other exposures to control for
confounding. In analysis of aspirin use, energy balance status such as body mass index and
physical activity may influence systemic inflammation status.141,142 Investigators need to
design a study, select populations, follow participants, collect information and
biospecimens, and establish an infrastructure for specimen and data management.143 For
example, the study by Liao et al.102 utilized databases of longitudinal prospective cohort
studies, the Nurses’ Health Study144 and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which
started in 1976 and 1986, respectively. Both studies have not only accumulated enormous
amounts of information on diet, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and personal and
family history of various diseases, but also established repositories of tumor tissues and
other biospecimens including blood, buccal cells, toenail and urine. Thus, Liao et al.102
could readily test the intriguing hypothesis of an interactive effect of aspirin and tumor
PIK3CA mutation, utilizing this valuable resource. Substantial resources and effort have
been devoted to these and other similar large-scale studies, which can help us better
understand various diseases and develop effective clinical and public health strategies to
decrease disease burden in our societies. Thus, utilization of existing resource can be a very
cost effective approach for public health research.145

The MPE concept takes into account the exposome as well as genome, epigenomes, and
interactomes in disease pathogenesis. Integration of MPE and systems biology (which
typically utilizes experimental model systems) will facilitate the development of new
research areas and clinical practice. In line with this integration of MPE and systems
biology, nanotechnologies and biosensors can be utilized for improvement of personalized
risk stratification, screening, and early detection of diseases.35,146,147
Can MPE Approach Be Used Routinely in Epidemiology Research?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because most epidemiologic studies and public disease databases lack tumor tissue
repositories and molecular data, MPE study designs may be regarded as the exception rather
than the rule. MPE has caveats; there is inherent multiple hypothesis testing.112 Because
multiple subtypes need to be assessed, sample size in MPE should ideally be large; however,
a given MPE dataset is usually confined to existing epidemiologic or clinical cohorts and
pathology specimen availability.112 It is well known that many tumor molecular features are
associated with each other.25,148-156 Thus, often multiple biomarkers need to be
simultaneously assessed. Moreover, to move steps closer to personalized precision medicine,
we should be able to address research and clinical questions on less deleterious mutations
and mutations in genes which are rarely mutated in a given cancer. All of these factors
necessitate large sample sizes in MPE research.
Given the power and promise of MPE research exemplified by Liao et al.,102 how can we
facilitate integrative MPE-type research to advance public health science? One near-term
solution is the use of non-molecular tumor subtyping, which can reflect tumor molecular
biology. For example, colorectal cancer can be classified as fatal cancer vs. non-fatal cancer,
which can reflect biological aggressiveness. However, such tumor subtyping is not an
optimal classification method since it only captures the behavior of tumor subtypes only to a
limited extent.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Molecular testing is increasingly routine in colorectal cancer. For example, KRAS mutation
testing is common for prediction of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.55,157,158 MSI and
BRAF mutation testing is common for screening of hereditary colorectal cancer.159 More
recently, multi-gene testing utilizing next generation sequencing platform is increasingly
common. Therefore, it may be possible that population cancer registries can integrate this
routine clinical molecular testing data with standard demographic, clinical, and pathological
information. Tumor molecular data accumulated in population disease registries will enable
investigators to conduct MPE research without necessarily assuming the substantial expense
of collecting tissue materials for analysis of tumor molecular changes. Such a population
MPE database will be useful to test basic science findings in a population-based human
sample,160 towards timely research translation into clinical use. Figure 2 illustrates an
example of integrative population-based MPE database, which enables us to readily test a
multitude of research hypotheses towards potential translation into clinical and public health
practice.
It may be a challenging task to transform population disease registries into “population
molecular pathology registries”. On a basic level, we should introduce MPE concepts within
public health schools,125,135,161 so that students can learn not only traditional epidemiologic

concepts, but also the molecular pathologic basis of human diseases. This may lead to a new
generation of public health practitioners and researchers with a solid understanding of MPE
that can lead to effective establishment, development and utilization of population-based
molecular pathology registry databases.
As we develop such population molecular pathology registries, additional challenges will
emerge. For example, next generation sequencing assays will enable us to sequence an
individual's whole exome or genome at a reasonable cost, perhaps as a routine clinical test.
Such technology may lead to ready determination of not only the identities of individuals
but also the presence of potential known disease-causing mutations that can have profound
clinical implications for an individual as well as his/her relatives. How molecular
information can or should be accessed in population registries for research remains a
significant issue that has yet to be resolved.

Conclusions and Future Perspectives

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We are moving more towards increasingly interdisciplinary, integrative science.
Epidemiology also needs to transform for the new era of medicine and public health.162 The
importance of team science and an interdisciplinary education system has repeatedly been
discussed.125,133,135,161,163,164 Currently, the MPE study such as the one by Liao et al.102
represents a rare unique example of interdisciplinary research for which a replication study
cannot easily be performed. However, in the future it may be possible to transform
population disease registries into molecular pathology databases, since molecular testing is
increasingly routine in clinical practice. Such population molecular pathology registries will
enable investigators to perform MPE research as routine practice. In order to achieve this
goal, we should consider introducing MPE concepts within the standard population science
training. Providing such an education will hopefully lead to the next generation of
population scientists who can firmly understand the principles of MPE and can advance
integrative science to move us closer to our goal of personalized medicine and health care.

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A comprehensive search for relevant English language publications was performed in
Pubmed utilizing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms, and other terms
(“epidemiology”, “cancer”, “tumor”, “molecular pathology”, “molecular pathological
epidemiology”, “exposure”, “biomarker”, “aspirin”, “NSAIDs”, “anti-inflammatory
drug”, “survival”, “response”), in various combinations. The list of references in
retrieved articles was assessed for additional relevant articles. A final decision to include
or exclude a given article was based on the quality, relevance, and uniqueness of the
article.

Figure 1.

Outcome of patients with PIK3CA-mutated colorectal cancer appears to differ according to
the status of regular aspirin use after cancer diagnosis. The likelihood of long term survival
among aspirin users is higher than that among non-aspirin users. The findings suggest that
aspirin use may interact with molecular status of tumor to modify a tumor phenotype and
clinical behavior.
