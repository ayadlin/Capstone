ABSTRACT
Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a promising therapeutic
strategy for BRCA1 deficient cancers, however, the development of drug resistance
limits clinical efficacy. Previously we found that the BRCA1-AKT1 pathway contributes
to tumorigenesis and that the AKT1/mTOR is a novel therapeutic target for BRCA1deficient cancers. Here, we report that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a
mTOR downstream effector, is greatly increased in BRCA1 deficient cells resistant
to PARP inhibition. Phosphorylation of S6 is associated with DNA damage and repair
signaling during PARP inhibitor treatment. In BRCA1 deficient cells, expression of S6
lacking all five phosphorylatable sites renders the cells sensitive to PARP inhibitor and
increases DNA damage signals. In addition, the S6 mutations reduce tumor formation
induced by Brca1-deficiency in mice. Inhibition of S6 phosphorylation by rapamycin
restores PARP sensitivity to resistant cells. Combined treatment with rapamycin
and PARP inhibitor effectively suppresses BRCA1-deficient tumor growth in mice.
These results provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which BRCA1 deficient
cancers acquire drug resistance and suggest a new therapeutic strategy to circumvent
resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Most BRCA1 mutations result in truncated BRCA1 gene
products that lack one or both C-terminal BRCT domains
[6;7].
BRCA1-deficient cells have compromised DNA
repair and are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) inhibitors [8-10]. Loss or dysfunction of
BRCA1 gene causes a deficiency in the homologous
recombination (HR) repair and RAD51 focus
formation, which contributes to genomic instability
and tumorigenesis [11;12]. PARP inhibition is synthetic
lethal with defective DNA repair via HR and, phase 1
as well as phase 2 clinical trials have shown that PARP
inhibitors have effective anti-tumor activity for BRCA-

The breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) is
commonly found to be mutated in hereditary breast and
ovarian cancers. In addition, BRCA1 protein expression
is frequently reduced or is absent in sporadic cases,
suggesting that it influences both hereditary and sporadic
mammary tumorigenesis [1;2]. The BRCA1 protein
contains C-terminal tandem BRCT domains that are
phosphoprotein binding motifs, which are important for
the tumor-suppressor and DNA repair function of BRCA1
[3-5]. Clinically relevant missense mutations identified at
the C-terminus of BRCA1 abolish the structure of BRCT.

associated cancers [13;14]. Despite an initial response,
chemo-resistance development eventually limits clinical
efficacy [15-18]. The resistant mechanism is unclear, as
data from fundamental and preclinical research indicates
multiple mechanisms including genetic reversion of
BRCA mutations, hypomorphic activity of mutant
BRCA1 alleles, upregulation of drug efflux pumps and
rewiring of the DNA damage response [19;20]. We
previously demonstrated that the AKT/mTOR oncogenic
pathway contributes to BRCA1-deficient tumorigenesis
and defective DNA repair [21-23]. Here, we identify a
novel mechanism for acquired PARP inhibitor resistance
by demonstrating that phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway,
mediates PARP inhibitor resistance through attenuating
the DNA damage response and restoring defective HR in
BRCA1-deficient cancer cells.

Increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein
S6 in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells is associated
with resistance to a PARP inhibitor
To examine the role of ribosomal protein S6 in
PARP inhibitor resistance, we used a PARP inhibitor
olaparib to treat HCC1937 breast cancer cell line. This cell
line is hemizygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele 5382insC
and therefore expresses a BRCA1 protein lacking the
COOH-terminal BRCT repeats. The mutation eliminates
the activity of BRCA1 in the repair of DNA damage and
maintenance of genomic stability and is associated with
an increased risk of cancer. Treatment with olaparib
for up to 5 days did not change ribosomal protein S6
phosphorylation in HCC1937 cells (Fig. 1A), however,

Fig. 1: S6 phosphorylation is increased in BRCA1 deficient cells with long time olaparib treatment. A. HCC1937 cells

after two weeks of treatment S6 phosphorylation strongly
increased. Expression of wild-type BRCA1 in HCC1937
cells reduced the basal levels of S6 phosphorylation,
consistent with our previous reports [22;23] (Fig. 1B). In
addition, expression of BRCA1 suppressed the increase in
S6 phosphorylation induced by olaparib treatment of two
weeks. Furthermore, MEFs expressing a truncated Brca1
allele (Brca1tr/tr) [5;22] showed higher S6 phosphorylation
level two weeks after olaparib treatment (Fig. 1C),
while Brca1+/+ MEFs did not. A similar phenomenon
was observed in another BRCA1-mutant cell line
SUM149 that S6 phosphorylation level increased after

two week treatment with olaparib, but did not change in
BRCA1 proficient cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231
(Supplemental Fig. 1 and data not shown). These results
suggest that BRCA1 deficiency and S6 phosphorylation
are involved in PARP inhibitor resistance.
To verify PARP inhibitor resistance, we cultured
HCC1937 in the presence of olaparib and obtained
drug-resistant clones emerged 2-3 months after initial
exposure. Colony formation assay showed that these
clones were highly resistant to olaparib (Fig. 1D). Lethal
concentrations 50 (LC50) were about 450- to 600-fold
greater than those for parental cells for olaparib. We

measured mTOR and S6 protein levels by Western blot. S6
phosphorylation and its upstream kinase mTORC1 greatly
increased in all olaparib resistant clones, whereas the total
overall protein levels of S6 and mTORC2 were similar in
parental cells and resistant clones (Fig. 1E), indicating that
the mTORC1-S6 phosphorylation pathway is involved in
PARP inhibitor resistance. To investigate drug efflux as
a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance, we examined
cellular poly(ADP-ribose)(PAR) levels to determine the
ability of olaparib to inhibit the PARP enzyme. Western

analysis showed that olaparib reduced the levels of PAR
to a similar degree in HCC1937 parental cells and in
the resistant clones (Supplemental Fig. 2). These results
suggest that altered drug efflux does not directly contribute
to PARP inhibitor resistance.

S6P-/- HCC1937 cells are sensitive to the PARP
inhibitor
To investigate the role of S6 phosphorylation
in PARP inhibitor resistance, we generated
unphosphorylatable S6 knock-in HCC1937 cells. A recent
report described a high-frequency genome editing method
based on the directional HR mechanism in somatic cells
that utilized ssDNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs) with
zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) [24]. Using this method, we
replaced all phosphorylatable serine residues (S235, S236,
S240, S244, and S247) with alanines in the endogenous
S6 gene (Fig. 2A). We designed a ssODN donor to span
the mutation site and the ZFN cleavage site as well as
flanking homology sequence. The S6-specific ZFNs

proteins that specifically bind to exon 5 of S6 genomic
DNA, and the non-specific nuclease domain of restriction
enzyme FokI that generates double-strand DNA cleavage,
which also greatly stimulated HR frequency for ssODN
donor replacement. The replacement of genomic DNA

resulted in creating a knock-in S6P-/-. To enable restriction

and PARP resistant cells

obtained and screened by RFLP assay (Fig. 2B). Four
S6P-/- monoclonal lines were identified then verified by
qPCR, Southern blot, Northern blot and genomic DNA
sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 3 and data not shown).
Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Ser235/236 or –
Ser240/244 antibodies, did not detect any phosphorylation of
these sites in S6 (Fig. 2C). Together these data demonstrate
that these phosphorylatable serine residues in S6 are
absent in S6P-/- HCC1937 cells. To determine the role
of S6 phosphorylation in PARP inhibitor resistance, we
cultured S6P-/- HCC1937 cells with olaparib and measured
cell survival. Results from colony formation assays
indicated that S6P-/- cells were highly sensitive to olaparib
(Fig. 2D) and LC50 was about 400- to 600-fold lower than
those for olaparib resistance clones. We conclude that S6
phosphorylation may be responsible for PARP inhibitor
resistance in BRCA1 deficient cells.

Next, we examined the DNA damage response
by measuring the formation of nuclear foci containing
phosphorylated histone γH2AX, a surrogate marker
of DNA double-strand break. Immunostaining assay
showed that γH2AX foci were readily detected in parental
HCC1937 cells following irradiation (IR), consistent with
the previous report [21]. In the olaparib resistant clones,
γH2AX foci were significantly decreased, compared with
those in the parental cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. 4).
Furthermore, quantitative data revealed a 2-fold increase
in S6P-/- HCC1937 cells with H2AX foci, compared with
S6 wild-type cells (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus,
these data indicate that S6 phosphorylation is involved in
the DNA damage response.
BRCA1-deficient cells display defective in HR
[11;12]. Therefore, we measured RAD51 focus formation

after IR, a marker for HR, which is impaired in BRCA1deficient cells [25-27]. Wild-type, PARP resistant clone
and S6P-/- HCC1937 cells were treated with IR and stained
with a RAD51 antibody (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig.
5). Analysis of these IR-induced RAD51 foci revealed a
diminished response upon depletion of BRCA1, consistent
with previous observations [25;27]. PARP resistant clones
readily formed RAD51 foci following IR. Moreover,
RAD51 foci could not be detected in S6P-/- HCC1937 cells.
These data suggest that S6 phosphorylation might regulate
the HR process.

We tested the effects of rapamycin and olaparib on
Brca1-deficient tumors in mice and found that olaparib
significantly inhibited S6-/- tumor growth. Rapamycin
treatment inhibited tumor growth from all transplanted
cell lines including olaparib resistant cells (Figs. 5BC),
suggesting that rapamycin may have better therapeutic
effects on olaparib resistant tumors and the tumors with
high expressing level of S6 phosphorylation. Consistent
with this hypothesis, combination treatments of rapamycin
with olaparib had a more inhibitory effect for olaparib
resistant cell-induced tumors as well as parental cellinduced tumors (Figs. 5BC). Analyses of tumor lysates
by Western blot and IHC assays indicated that rapamycin
greatly reduced the levels of S6 phosphorylation (Figs.
6AB), consistent with rapamycin inhibition of the mTOR
signaling. Consistent with in vitro data, rapamycin
treatment significantly increased γH2AX foci in the
olaparib resistant cell-induced tumors and parental control
cell-induced tumors (Fig. 6C).

Rapamycin restores sensitivity of HCC1937
resistant clones to the PARP inhibitor
To further study the role of mTOR/S6 pathway
in PARP resistance, we tested the effect of rapamycin,
a clinically used selective inhibitor of mTORC1 and
S6 phosphorylation. Treatment with rapamycin alone
produced a reduction of colony formation in the similar
level in HCC1937 S6P-/-, olaparib resistant and parental
cells (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, these
cells were very sensitive to combinational treatments
of rapamycin with olaparib, and almost no clones were
formed, suggesting that rapamycin could overcome
olaparib resistance and S6 phosphorylation may be
associated with it. Western blot analysis showed that
rapamycin treatment suppressed S6 phosphorylation in
olaparib resistant cells as well as in HCC1937 parental
cells (Fig. 4B), supporting a role for S6 phosphorylation
in PARP inhibitor resistance. As expected, rapamycin
treatment significantly increased γH2AX foci and
decreased RAD51 foci in the olaparib resistant clone (Fig.
4C). Taken together, these data indicate that rapamycin
may restore BRCA1 deficient cell sensitivity to olaparib
through inhibition of S6 phosphorylation.

DISCUSSION
Previously we found that the BRCA1-AKT1
pathway contributes to tumorigenesis and that the AKT1/
mTOR is a novel therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient
cancers [21-23]. Here, we provide evidence that, under
PARP inhibitor selection pressure, phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6 is dramatically increased. Using both
rapamycin and a S6 mutant deficient for phosphorylation,
we have shown that S6 phosphorylation is an important
mediator of the PARP inhibitor resistance. We have
found a synergy between rapamycin and olaparib for
the treatment of BRCA1-mutant and olaparib resistant
tumors. Importantly, S6 phosphorylation attenuates
DNA damage and promotes RAD51 loading onto
DNA following DNA damage. Both rapamycin and the
phosphorylation deficient S6 mutant enhance γH2AX
focus formation without altering PAR activity, suggesting
increased DNA damage when S6 phosphorylation is
inhibited in the context of BRCA1 mutation. In vivo
γH2AX foci in tumors were increased when mice were
treated with rapamycin during the period of response,
supporting a progressive accumulation of unrepaired DNA
DSBs. Consistent with this notion, a recent report has
shown that S6 phosphorylation attenuates DNA damage
and tumor suppression in pancreatic cancer [28]. Of
particular interest is our observation that inhibition of S6
phosphorylation greatly reduces RAD51 focus formation
in the PARP resistant cells. These results suggest that S6
phosphorylation is required for recruitment of RAD51
into DNA damage sites. Because BRCA1 is a key factor
recruiting RAD51 to DNA damage sites, it is possible
that S6 phosphorylation becomes more critical for this
recruitment in BRCA1 deficient cells. Previous reports
have shown that the PTEN-PI3K pathway contributes
to DNA DSB accumulation [29-31], possible through

Combined rapamycin and PARP inhibitor
treatment effectively suppresses BRCA1-deficient
tumor growth in mice
The colony formation assay showed reduced cell
viabilities in S6P-/- HCC1937 cells compared with parental
control cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that S6 phosphorylation
may be involved in tumorigenesis. Therefore, HCC1937
S6P-/-, olaparib resistant and parental cells were implanted
into SCID mice and tumor formation was monitored
for 9 weeks. Implantation of control parental HCC1937
cells resulted in tumor formation in 19 of 20 mice (Fig.
5A). Removal of the S6 phosphorylations was sufficient
to suppress tumor development and only 12 of 20 mice
generated tumors. All olaparib resistant cells generated
tumors (n=20). In addition, these resistant cells also
resulted in larger tumors compared with those from
parental control cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown).

regulation of PARP activation. It would not contribute
to the reliance on PARP activity for DNA damage repair
because we do not observe alteration of PARP activity in
our model. In future studies, additional experiments will
be needed to understand the molecular mechanism of these
factors in DNA repair processes.
Recent reports show that 53BP1 loss rescues
BRCA1 deficiency and is associated with triple-negative
and Brca1-mutated breast cancer [32;33]. However,
other reports indicate that 53BP1 depletion only partly
contributes to PARP inhibitor resistance [34] and confers
only a slight degree of resistance [15;35]. 53BP1 inhibits
HR in Brca1-deficient cells by blocking resection of
DNA breaks. We have previously shown that the AKT
pathway is associated with HR in BRCA1-deficient cells
[21]—this is somewhat similar to the ability of 53BP1
loss rescuing HR in BRCA1-deficient cells. We did not
observe 53BP1 changes during olaparib treatment in
our model (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that S6
phosphorylation and 53BP1 independently regulate HR in
BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to PARP inhibitor. 53BP1
and BRCA1 may regulate the choice between HR and
non-homologous end joining. One critical function for
BRCA1 might be to remove end-joining proteins such as
53BP1 from replication-associated breaks. Thus, BRCA1
might regulate phosphorylated S6 and 53BP1 in different
steps during the HR process. The molecular details of
these proteins in the HR process need further investigation
in the future.
One mechanism of PARP resistance is upregulation
of drug efflux pumps [19;20]. Although we did not
observe any change in PARP activity in resistant cells, we
cannot rule out that S6 phosphorylation might indirectly
contribute to PARP inhibition resistance through this
mechanism. PARP activation induces the depletion of
its substrate NAD+ and consecutively depletion of ATP,
resulting in energy loss and eventually cell apoptosis.
Previous reports have shown that S6 phosphorylation
is a determinant of glucose homeostasis [36;37]. S6P/mice have impaired glucose tolerance through insulin
deficiency [37], leading to decreased energy production
via glycolysis. Both glycolysis and PAR consume NAD+
and compete for NAD+ in the cytosol. PARP inhibition
spares NAD+ and generates a prosurvival effect for PARP
inhibitor resistant cells. Inhibition of S6 phosphorylation
leads to low level of glucose supply and glycolytic
activity, leading to cell apoptosis. Therefore, a possible
interpretation for the synergy of S6 phosphorylation and
PARP inhibition is that inhibition of S6 phosphorylation
reverses the effects of PARP inhibitor resistance on cell
survival. Consistent with this model, a recent report
shows that PI3K inhibition can reverse response of PARP
inhibition through enhancement of glucose uptake and
AKT phosphorylation [31].
Collectively, S6 phosphorylation might play a key
role in PARP inhibitor resistance through regulations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of DNA damage response/the HR repair process and
glucose metabolism. Combinational inhibitions of S6
phosphorylation and PARP might predict to be particularly
effective in cancers with PARP inhibitor resistance and
HR defects, such as BRCA1-deficient breast and ovarian
cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

the lentiviral vectors and compatible packaging plasmids
mixture using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and the lentivirus supernatant was collected
40 h after transfection. For virus infection, cells were
exposed to lentivirus supernatant for 24 h in the presence
of polybrene (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Protein
extracts from cells and xenograft tumors were extracted
to conduct western blot analysis as described previously
[23;38-40].

sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) and heated for
10 min in a pressure cooker. The slides were allowed to
cool to room temperature. Slides were blocked with 5%
of goat serum in Tris buffered saline (TBS) buffer for
60 min at room temperature. The diluted primary antibody
was then added and incubated in a moist chamber at 4 °C
overnight. Biotinylated secondary antibody was added for

the manufacturer instruction (Vector Laboratories). After
mounting, the slides were observed under microscope and
pictures were taken.

Indirect immunofluorescence
Experiments were performed as described
[39;41;42]. Briefly, for conventional immunofluorescence
microscopy, the cells were examined with a Zeiss
Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD
camera (Ontario, NY, USA). Images were captured,
pseudocolored and merged using IPLab image analysis
software. At least 200 cells were analyzed for each
experiment. The experiments were repeated at least three
times.

Tumor growth and treatment experiments
Animal experiments were performed according to
institutional guidelines for animal welfare. Female NOD.
SCID/NCR mice of 6–8 weeks of age were purchased
from NCI-Frederick Animal Production Program
(Frederick, MA, USA). In all, 2 × 106 HCC1937 S6P-/-,
olaparib resistant and parental cells in 0.1 ml PBS were
mixed with equal volume of matrigel. The cell mixture
was implanted into mouse breast fat pad. After 9 weeks,
the tumors became rigid and the volume of tumor ((L ×
W2)/2) is measured in range of 180–250 mm3. The mice
were assigned to vehicle and treatment groups and mean
tumor volumes at the start point for treatment were
indistinguishable between the vehicle and treatment
groups. Rapamycin was injected at 0.3 mg/kg diluted in
100 μl of vehicle on the first treatment and then at 0.15 mg/
kg every other day for 18 days. Olaparib was used at 50
