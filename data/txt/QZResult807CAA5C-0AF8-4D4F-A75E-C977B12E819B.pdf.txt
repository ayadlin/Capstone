ABSTRACT
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the disruption of
cell–cell junctions and imbues cancer cells with invasive and migratory properties.
In this study, we investigated the effect of gambogic acid, a xanthone extracted from
the resin of Garciania hanburyi, on transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced
EMT. Gambogic acid inhibited the invasion and migration of TGFβ1-induced A549
cells in vitro. Gambogic acid also increased the mRNA and protein expression of
E-cadherin, but repressed the mRNA and protein expression of N-cadherin, vimentin,
and transcription factor TWIST1. Further examination of the mechanism revealed
that the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway is involved in this regulation of EMTrelated biomarkers. Gambogic acid inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and the
phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) and IκBα kinase (IKKα). Gambogic
acid also suppressed the EMT induced by TGFβ1 and tumor necrosis factor α by
inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Our data also indicate that gambogic acid inhibited
the primary lesion and lung metastasis of orthotopic model of A549 cells in vivo. We
propose that gambogic acid might be developed as a candidate drug with therapeutic
potential for the treatment of cancer invasion and migration.

reduced and they are converted into motile, nonpolarized
mesenchymal cells [4]. These cells acquire migratory
and invasive properties and modulate the organization of
their actin cytoskeletons. The molecular markers of the
cells also change dramatically. The epithelial molecular
markers E-cadherin and the cytokeratins are lost, whereas
the mesenchymal molecular markers N-cadherin and
vimentin are induced [5]. EMT plays key roles in embryonic
development, but its importance in the progression of
cancer is increasingly recognized. It is related not only
to the invasiveness of cancer, but also to its metastatic
dissemination, resistance to apoptosis, and acquisition of
cancer stem-cell-like properties [6, 7].

INTRODUCTION
Cancer invasion and metastasis are critical events that
change a locally growing tumor into a systemic disease [1].
Metastasis is responsible for up to 90% of cancer-related
mortality [2]. The main steps in invasion include changes
in cell–cell adhesion and the activation of cytoskeletal
dynamics, followed by plastic tumor cell migration into
the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1]. The epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) is the primary invasive
process, with a loss of cell–cell junctions and changes in the
cell morphology [3]. During EMT, the intercellular adhesion
of nonmotile, polarized, and collective epithelial cells is

Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is the
inducer of EMT most commonly used in in vitro studies
[8]. The roles TGFβ1 and EMT in cancer progression
have been investigated by many tumor biologists, but the
mechanism of TGFβ1-induced EMT is not completely
understood. TGFβ1-induced signaling can activate
multiple distinct intracellular effector molecules, including
the direct ligand-activated receptors of the SMAD
transcription factors and the indirect NF-κB pathway [9].
TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1) is a MAPKK kinase
activated by TGFβ1 [10], which is a stimulus for the NFκB pathway [11]. Once activated, IKK phosphorylates
IκBα, and NF-κB is released. The NF-κB heterodimer
p65 is then translocated to the nucleus and binds to its
target promoter [12]. p65 can bind to the promoter of
the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor ZEB-1/2, thus
regulating EMT [13]. p65 can also regulate TWIST1
transcription by binding directly to the TWIST1 promoter
[14]. TWIST1, a known key regulator of morphogenesis,
can also induce EMT [15]. Therefore, the activated
NF-κB pathway in EMT leads to the activation of the
transcriptional regulator TWIST, which regulates the
expression of E-cadherin. The loss of E-cadherin results
in EMT and the disruption of cell–cell adhesion, which is
considered to be the initiator of tumor cell migration and
invasion [16].
Gambogic acid (GA) is a potential antitumor
compound that is extracted from the resin of Garciania
hanburyi. GA inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing
the tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor-2 [17] and inhibiting the PHD2–
VHL–HIF1α pathway [18]. The molecular mechanism
of its anti-invasive effect could be the inhibition of
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in
human breast carcinoma cells [19, 20]. GA also inhibits
cell adhesion, but exerts an antimetastatic effect by
suppressing integrin β1 and reducing the cholesterol
content of cells [21].
In this study, we tested the anti-invasive and antimigratory capacities of GA in TGFβ1-induced A549 cells
and clarified its effects on the EMT process. Because EMT
is a crucial step in the migration and invasion of cancer
cells, the effects of GA on EMT biomarkers and EMTrelated transcription factors were also investigated.

EMT imbues cancer cells with invasive and
migratory properties. Therefore, we investigated the
anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects of GA on
TGFβ1-triggered EMT with Matrigel invasion and wound
healing assays. GA inhibited the migration of TGFβ1stimulated A549 cells across the wounded space in a
concentration-dependent manner (16.7%, 61.5%, and
77.8%, respectively) (Figure 1B). Treatment with GA also
reduced the invasiveness of A549 cells through Matrigel.
The rates of inhibition were about 13.2%, 43.6%, and
71.8% (Figure 1C). A FITC–phalloidin staining assay was
performed to observe the structure of F-actin. GA (1 μM)
suppressed TGFβ1-induced changes in cell morphology
and actin remodeling (Figure 1D).
These results indicate that GA inhibits TGFβ1induced migration and invasion by A549 cells in vitro.

GA regulates the mRNA expression of EMTrelated biomarkers and transcription factor
TWIST1 expression
E-Cadherin is an epithelial biomarker, whereas
vimentin is a mesenchymal biomarker. The switch between
E-cadherin and N-cadherin is also a crucial process during
TGFβ1-induced EMT. As shown in Figure 2A, GA (0.25,
0.5, or 1 μM) increased E-cadherin expression (by 31.9%,
50.5%, or 101.1%, respectively) and reduced vimentin (by
9.9%, 35.1%, or 53.1%) and N-cadherin expression (by
17.9%, 25.8%, or 43.0%) in a concentration-dependent
manner, compared with the TGFβ1-treated group. Cancer
cells can also acquire an invasive capacity when EMT
occurs, which upregulates the level of the invasion-related
protein MMP-9 and the migration-related protein RAC1.
Our experiments also revealed that GA suppressed the
expression of MMP9 (by 17.2%, 31.1%, or 53.0%) and
RAC1 (by 10.9%, 33.2%, or 65.4%) in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 2A).
The mRNA levels of EMT biomarkers were
determined with real-time PCR after A549 cells were
treated with GA and TGFβ for 24 h. Our data showed that
GA (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM) increased E-cadherin mRNA
expression (by 9.9%, 40.8%, and 100.8%, respectively)
and reduced vimentin (by 14.7%, 37.2%, and 66.1%),
N-cadherin (by 10.7%, 30.5%, and 44.1%), MMP-9 (by
18.4%, 23.7%, and 32.0%), and RAC1 mRNA expression
(by 16.7%, 56.0%, and 69.5%) in a concentrationdependent manner compared with that of the TGFβ1treated control group (Figure 2C).
The mRNA and protein levels of TWIST1 and
SNAIL, which are transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin
and EMT regulators, were investigated. Our results show
that GA (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM) suppressed TWIST1 protein
(by 24.6%, 32.7%, and 62.0%) and mRNA expression
(12.9%, 24.1%, and 37.5%) in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2B and Figure 2C), but had no effect
on SNAIL protein or mRNA expression (Figure 2B and

RESULTS

An MTT assay showed that GA or TGFβ1 at various
concentration had almost no effect on the growth of A549
cells. The combination of GA (0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) and
TGFβ1 (5 ng/ml) also had no cytotoxic effect (Figure 1A).
These concentration ranges were used in all following
experiments.

Figure 2C). Moreover, after transfection with TWIST1
plasmid, the protein level of TWIST1 was overexpressed
and GA could also decrease TWIST1 expression
(Supplementary Figure 1G).

In addition, TGFβ1-induced Panc-1 cells and
TGFβ1+TNFα-induced SW480 cells were used to further
prove the inhibitory effect of GA on EMT. GA could
decrease the expression of vimentin and TWIST1 while

inhibits TGFβ1+TNFα-induced invasion by these cells.
GA inhibited the invasion of TGFβ1+TNFα-induced A549
cells (Figure 4C).
EMT biomarkers were then tested with a
western blot analysis. By blocking the cell response
to TGFβ1+TNFα treatment, GA restored E-cadherin,
vimentin and TWIST1 protein expression to basal levels
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4D).

GA inhibits the TGFβ1-induced activation of the
NF-κB pathways in A549 cells
TGFβ1 can activate NF-κB signaling via TAK-1,
and NF-κB activation results from the phosphorylation,
ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation
of IκBα. Continuous stimulation can induce TWIST1
expression, and then promote rearrangement of
cytoskeleton and breakage of cell-cell junctions. In
Figure 3A, compared with the TGFβ1-treated group, GA
(0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) inhibited IκBα phosphorylation (by
0.6%, 25.9%, or 41.9%, respectively) in a concentrationdependent manner. As phosphorylated IKKα is responsible
for the phosphorylation of IκBα, we next tested the effect
of GA on IKKα activation. We found that GA suppressed
the TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of IKKα (by 12.7%,
32.9%, or 42.8%) in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 3A). Furthermore, GA could also inhibit the
activation of NF-κB signaling in Panc-1 and SW480 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1E-1F).
The effect of GA on TGFβ1-induced NF-κB
DNA-binding activity was then evaluated with an
EMSA assay. We found that GA suppressed the DNAbinding activity of TGFβ1-induced NF-κB in A549 cells
(Figure 3B). The binding of NF-κB with downstream
promoters, especially transcription factor TWIST, is
crucial for inducing EMT. Thus, we tested the influence
of GA on the binding ability of NF-κB with the TWIST
promoter in A549 cells. The results of CHIP (Figure 3C)
indicated that GA could inhibit the binding with TWSITpromoter.

GA inhibits TGFβ1+TNFα-activated NF-κB
signaling in A549 cells
TGFβ1-induced EMT is accentuated by TNFα via
NF-κB signaling [27]. The combination of TGFβ1 and
TNFα is usually used to further drive EMT. Therefore,
we examined whether GA inhibits the key protein of the
NF-κB pathway activated by TGFβ1+TNFα. GA (0.25,
0.5, or 1 μM) suppressed the TGFβ1+TNFα-induced
phosphorylation of IKKα (by 14.5%, 47.3%, or 58.8%,
respectively) and IκBα (by 22.8%, 36.2%, or 62.1%) in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5A).
The translocation of p65, the functionally active
subunit of NF-κB, was also examined with a western blot
assay. As shown in Figure 5B, the increase in nuclear
p65 expression induced by TNFα+TGFβ1 was inhibited
by GA (1 μM), whereas the cytoplasmic p65 expression
increased.
NF-κB activation was then tested with a luciferase
reporter construct. The results showed that GA inhibited
p65 luciferase activity (by 14.2%, 28.8%, or 57.7%)
stimulated with TGFβ1+TNFα, in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5C).

Inhibition of TGFβ1-induced EMT by GA does
not require MAPK pathway
The MAPK pathway is also important in the
EMT process, of which MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK
pathways are both hotspots. Activation of ERK and
p38 MAPK pathways are required for TGFβ1-induced
EMT [28, 29]. GA (0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) exerted an
inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and
the inhibitory rate of phospho/total forms of MEK1/2
was 9.6%, 27.4%, and 50.5%, respectively. However,
it had no effect on the phosphorylation of p38 (Figure
6A). Therefore, we investigated the effects of GA on
EMT protein markers when p38 MAPK or the MEK1/2
pathway was inhibited. The EMT biomarkers were
investigated with a western blot analysis. U0126 (20
μM), an MEK1/2 inhibitor, did not reverse the process
of EMT, whereas the addition of GA (1 μM) increased
E-cadherin expression (by 56.7%) and reduced vimentin
(by 49.7%) and TWIST1 expression (41.5%) (Figure
6B). SB203580 (20 μM), a p38 MAPK inhibitor (the
inhibitory rate of phospho/total forms of p38 was

GA inhibits TGFβ1+TNFα-induced EMT and
invasion of A549 cells
NF-κB activation is induced by various
inﬂammatory stimuli, including TNFα, which is also an
inducer of EMT. To confirm the inhibitory effect of GA on
EMT, TNFα and TGFβ1 (TGFβ1+TNFα) were together
used to enhance the EMT process in A549 cells induced by
TGFβ1 alone. The results of a cell viability assay showed
that GA (0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) had almost no effect on the
growth of TGFβ1 (5 ng/ml)-induced and TNFα (20 ng/
ml)-induced A549 cells (Figure 4A). The normal shape
of the A549 cells was pebbled under a microscope. After
treatment with TGFβ1, the A549 cells became spindle
shaped. TGFβ1+TNFα conferred a needle-like shape on
A549 cells. However, GA (1 μM) inhibited this shape
change and the A549 cells became diamond shaped in
the presence of TGFβ1+TNFα (Figure 4B). A Matrigel
invasion assay was performed to investigate whether GA

SMAD4, or on the phosphorylation or total protein of
SMAD3 (Figure 7A and 7B). This indicates that GA does
not inhibit the EMT process directly via TGFβ1–SMAD
signaling. SIS3 (10 μM), an inhibitor of the SMAD
pathway (the inhibitory rate of phospho/total forms of p38
was 45.8%), increased E-cadherin expression (by 64.2%)
and slightly reduced vimentin (by 26.5%) and TWIST1
(by 28.9%) expression, and these effects were enhanced
by GA (Figure 7C). GA and SIS3 increased E-cadherin
expression (by 144.2%) and reduced vimentin (by
48.7%) and TWIST1 (by 69.4%) expression with TGFβ-1
stimulation (Figure 7C).
Gambogic acid is reported as a ligand for TfR in
triggering apoptosis. We used TfR small interfering
RNA (siRNA) to determine whether TfR participates
in the inhibition of EMT by GA. Expression of these
three marker proteins was unaffected whether cells were
transfected with transferrin receptor siRNA or scrambled
siRNA. TGFβ1-mediated reduction in E-cadherin
expression and increase in vimentin and TWIST1 protein
levels was refractory to the silencing of transferrin
receptor, so GA-mediated reversal of TGFβ1 signaling
still occurs in TfR siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 7D).

[32]. The release of cytokines and proteases by these cells
makes the microenvironment more reactive, promoting the
growth of tumors and the escape of cancer cells from the
primary tumor. TGFβ1, one of the important cytokines,
acts as a suppressor early in tumor progression, whereas
it acts as a tumor promoter in later stages [33]. The effect
of TGFβ1 as a tumor promoter reflects its ability to induce
EMT, which contributes to the invasion and migration of
cancer cells. Tumor EMT is a process in which cancer
cells lose their cell–cell junctions and acquire invasive
and migratory properties. The primary features of EMT
include the downregulation of epithelial cell markers,
the upregulation of mesenchymal cell markers and the
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Although EMT is
known to be involved in cancer invasion, it is also related
to other events in tumor progression. Therefore, EMT is
considered a potential target of therapeutic interventions
for cancer. Recent studies have shown that chemical
compounds from natural products, such as grape seed
proanthocyanidin and resveratrol, may offer a potential
resource for the interruption of EMT. In this study,
we have demonstrated that GA inhibits the migration,
invasion, and cytoskeletal remodeling of TGFβ1-induced
A549 cells in vitro, so GA exerted general anti-migratory
and anti-invasive activities during EMT.
GA suppresses the expression of TWIST1 mRNA
and protein. TWIST1, a key transcription factor in EMT,
contributes to EMT by regulating E-cadherin-mediated
cell–cell adhesion and the activation of mesenchymal
markers. Consistent with the functions of TWIST1, our
results demonstrate that GA increases the epithelial cell
marker E-cadherin expression, whereas it inhibits the
expression of the mesenchymal cell markers vimentin
and N-cadherin during TGFβ1-induced EMT. This
regulation of EMT biomarkers by GA further indicates
that it could inhibit the EMT process in TGFβ1-induced
A549 cells. Furthermore, GA functions at the level of
TWIST1 transcription. The TGFβ1-induced expression of
TWIST1 resulted in EMT and EMT initiated the invasion
and migration of A549 cells. Twist promotes the formation
of pseudopodia, and specialized membrane protrusions
for extracellular matrix degradation [34]. MMP-9 plays a
crucial role in ECM degradation and Rac1 plays key roles
in cytoskeletal reorganization and pseudopodia formation.
Following, we sought to clarify the mechanism by which
GA inhibits TGFβ1-induced EMT.
p65 is a multifunctional transcription factor
that regulates the expression of multiple target genes
during tumor invasion and migration [35]. NF-κB is
essential for both the induction and maintenance of
EMT [36]. Li also reported that p65 binds directly to
the TWIST1 promoter to regulate its expression and
that the TWIST1 promoter sequence from –970 to +1
contains four p65-binding sites [14]. Therefore, we
investigated whether GA inhibits the EMT process
in TGFβ1-induced A549 cells by suppressing NF-

GA suppresses lung growth and metastases of
A549 cells in vivo
The antitumor and antimigratory effects of GA
were further assessed with A549 orthotopic model in
vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of GA is adopted for good
absorption when long-term administration. The dosage of
GA in vivo is determined by LD50 (half lethal dose) in
nude mice and it is less than 1/6 of LD50. Afterwards,
lung lesions were macroscopically observed with a
camera (Figure 8A). We found from the HE staining
that the right lung lesions in the GA (2 mg/kg) treatment
group were fewer and smaller than those in the control
group (Figure 8B). The expression of E-cadherin, MMP9 and vimentin (Figure 8C) in right lung was stained by
immunohistochemistry assay from control mice, whereas
GA-treated group reversed the expression of these EMT
biomarkers, which is consistent with the results of invitro study. On the other hand, GA also significantly
reduced the metastatic nodules compared with those in
the control group by 89.9% (Figure 8A). Meanwhile, HE
staining showed that tumors of left lungs were reduced
pathologically with the treatment of GA.

DISCUSSION
Cancer metastasis is the primary cause of cancerrelated death. The acquisition of invasive and migratory
behavior by cells, which initiates the metastatic process
[30], is mediated by the tumor microenvironment [31].
Various host cell types are found in this microenvironment,
including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes

κB activation. Our results showed that GA inhibited
the phosphorylation of IKKα and IκBα induced by
TGFβ1, which suggested the inhibition of NF-κB
signaling. p65 is one of the dimeric proteins that make
up the transcriptional regulator NF-κB. In our EMSA
experiment, GA inhibited the DNA-binding activity of
p65. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay is needed
to further characterize the role of p65 in the regulation
of TWIST1 mRNA expression.
To confirm the inhibition of EMT by GA through the
NF-κB pathway, TNFα was used as an NF-κB activator
to accelerate TGFβ1-induced EMT in A549 cells. The
shape of A549 cells is more needle-like when treated with

TGFβ1+TNFα than when treated with TGFβ1 alone. GA
had a slight inhibitory effect on the growth activity of
A549 cells in the presence of TNFα+TGFβ1, but actively
suppressed EMT-related biomarkers, thus blocking the
invasion and migration of the A549 cells. Expression of the
epithelial cell marker E-cadherin increased and that of the
mesenchymal cell marker vimentin and the transcription
factor TWIST1 decreased. The phosphorylation of IKKα
and IκBα by TGFβ1+TNFα was inhibited by GA in a
concentration-dependent manner. GA also inhibited the
activation and nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, which
indicates that GA suppresses p65 binding to the TWIST1
promoter.

TGFb activates other non-SMAD signaling
pathways such as MAPK pathways [37]. The MAPK
pathway is also a crucial mediator of EMT and we showed
that GA had an inhibitory effect on the MEK, but GA did
not affect p38MAPK pathway. Although GA inhibited the
phosphorylation of MEK1/2 after stimulation with TGFβ1,
an inhibitor of the MEK1/2 pathway did not affect TGFβ1induced EMT. This result resembles the inhibition of
MEK/ERK by U0126 in HK-2 cells [38]. The addition of
GA inhibits EMT process. Therefore, MEK/ERK pathway
was not involved as the main mechanism of the inhibition
of EMT by GA. A blockage of p38MAPK pathway
could inhibit EMT and GA accelerated the inhibition of
EMT by SB203580, for the reason that the effect of p38
inhibition on E-cadherin expression is modulated by the
TAK1-NF-κB pathway. Ligand-activated SMAD signaling
is the direct target of TGFβ1, but GA had little effect on
SMAD signaling. SIS3 and GA treatment could further
inhibit EMT. GA could inhibit EMT through another
pathway rather than SMAD pathway, which indicated the
specificity of the NF-κB pathway in the inhibition of EMT
by GA [39].
TfR is reported to be significantly overexpressed in
different types of cancers and GA is thought to be a ligand
of TfR in cell apoptosis [40]. We found that the inhibition
of EMT by GA is not independent of TfR expression
and that silencing the TfR gene did not influence EMT
markers. Therefore, TfR does not participate in this effect
of GA. We attributed this to the concentration of GA used
in this study, which did not cause apoptosis in A549 cells.
Previously, we found that GA exerts an inhibitory
effect on the migration of cancer cells in vivo in a
spontaneous experimental A549 metastasis model [41].
In this study, we use orthotopic model of A549 cells to
investigate the inhibitory effect on tumor growth and
EMT. Our results show that GA suppresses lung growth
and metastasis of A549 cells and EMT biomarkers were
improved, confirming the effects of GA on the motility of
A549 cells in vivo.
In summary, suppressing the activity of E-cadherin
repressors is an obvious strategy to avert cancer
progression. Cancer therapeutic drugs that inhibit the
EMT process have potential utility. GA inhibits NF-κB
signaling, thus blocking the TGFβ1-induced EMT process
by suppressing TWIST1 expression. As a consequence,
GA can suppress the invasion and migration of tumor
cells. Therefore, GA may be a potential therapeutic agent
for the treatment of tumor invasion by inhibiting EMT.

Animals
Five- to six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice
(Slaccas Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China) were used for the orthotopic model of A549
cells. The animals were maintained in a pathogen-free
environment (23 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity) on a 12 h
light/12 h dark cycle with food and water supplied ad
libitum throughout the experimental period.

Cell culture
Human alveolar adenocarcinoma A549 cells were
originally obtained from the Cell Bank of the Shanghai
Institute of Cell Biology. The A549 cells were cultured in
F-12 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100
mg/L streptomycin, in a stable environment with 5% CO2
at 37 °C.

Cell viability assay
Cells were plated at a density of 104 cell/well in
96-well plates in F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum. After overnight culture, the cells were exposed
to different concentrations of TGFβ1 (0, 2.5, or 5 ng/
ml) and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) for 24 h in a 5%
CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Then, MTT was added to the
medium and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The
supernatant was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide was used
to dissolve the precipitate. The absorbance was measured
spectrophotometrically at 570 nm.

Cell invasion assay
The Transwell chambers (Corning Costar,
Cambridge, MA) were first loaded with 0.1 ml of Matrigel
(Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h. After
TGFβ1 (0 or 5 ng/ml) and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) were
added to the A549 cells for 24 h, the cells were collected
in F-12 medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 105 cell/
ml. The cell suspensions were then placed in the upper
compartment, and medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum was added to the lower compartment. Following
incubation for 24 h, the invasive cells on the lower surface
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and then
quantiﬁed by manual counting and ﬁve randomly chosen
ﬁelds were analyzed for each group.

Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts
A549 cells were treated with TGFβ1 (0 or 5 ng/
ml) and GA (0 or 1 μM) for 24 h. Nuclear and cytosolic
protein extracts were prepared according to the modiﬁed
method described previously [24].

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
A549 cells were treated with TGFβ1 (0 or 5 ng/ml)
and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) for 24 h. Nuclear extract
preparation and EMSAs were performed as described
previously [24]. Oligonucleotides containing an NFκB-binding site were used in the EMSAs according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Haimen, China). The oligonucleotides
were labeled with biotin using standard protocols. The
sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows:
5’-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3’
and
3’-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGGTCCG-5’.

Immunoﬂuorescence
A549 cells were pretreated with GA (0 or 1 μM) and
TGFβ1 (0 or 5 ng/ml) for 24 h and then harvested. FITC–
phalloidin was used to probe the samples for 1 h to analyze
actin remodeling. After the cells were washed, they were
stained with DAPI for 20 min. The samples were observed
and images captured with confocal microscopy (Olympus
Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Western blotting

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments

A549 cells were harvested after TGFβ1 (0 or 5
ng/ml) and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) had been added
to the cells for 24 h. Western blotting was performed as
previously described [23]. The membrane was blocked
with 10% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1.5 h and incubated
overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies, and then
with IRDye®800-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h
at 37 °C. The samples were visualized with the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE).

A549 cells were exposed to treated with TGFb1 (0
or 5 ng/ml) and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) for 24 h. Cells
were cross-linked with formaldehyde, quenched with
glycine, sonicated on ice, incubated with anti-TWIST
or pre-immune IgG with rotation at 4 °C overnight
and then incubated with protein A+G agarose for 6 h.
Then, immune complexes were capturedbby protein
A+G agarose and eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS,
0.1mol/l NaHCO3) at 37 °C for 30min. Cross-linking
was reversed at 65 °C for 4 h in a high-salt buffer.
Extracted and dissolved immunoprecipitated DNA
was quantified by RT-PCR. An equal volume of nonprecipitated (input) genomic DNA was used to correct
for the differences in PCR amplification efficiencies and
amounts of DNA. Real-time PCR analyses were carried
out as described above. The following promoter was used
in this experiment: TWIST promoter (forward, 5’-CCG
GGT ACC CTT TCA AGG TCA CAA TGC GGA GCC
-3’, reverse, 5’-ATA CTC GAG TGG GCG AGA GCT
GCA GAC TTG G -3’).

Real-time PCR analysis
A549 cells were treated with TGFβ1 (0 or 5 ng/
ml) and GA (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM) for 24 h. The mRNA
levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, MMP9, RAC1, and TWIST1 were then determined with a
method described previously [23]. The primer sets used
for the PCR ampliﬁcations were as follows: E-cadherin
(forward, 5’-CCACCAAAGTCACGCTGAAT-3’, reverse,
5’-GGAGTTGGGAAATGTGAGC-3’), SNAIL (forward,

Orthotopic injections were performed following
the previous study with minor modifications [25]. A549
cells (5 × 106) in 50 μl matrigel were quickly injected
into the thorax. Animal was observed for 30 min until
fully recovery. Two weeks later, the mice were randomly
divided into two groups (ten/group) and intraperitoneally
injected every other day for 30 days with GA (2 mg/kg)
or saline. The animals were then killed. The lungs were
removed and fixed in Bouin’s solution for 4 h, and the
number of lesions was determined macroscopically.
Sections of the lungs were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin to conﬁrm that the nodules were malignant and to
monitor the presence of micrometastases.
