ABSTRACT
ATP1B1 encodes the Na,K-ATPase β subunit, a key regulator of the Na+ and K+
electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane and an essential regulator of
cellular activity. We used several microarray datasets to test the prognostic efficacy
of ATP1B1 expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML).
Within the primary cohort (n = 157), high ATP1B1 expression (ATP1B1high) was
associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P =
0.0068, P = 0.0039, respectively). Similar results were also obtained in the European
Leukemia Net (ELN) Intermediate-I genetic category (OS: P = 0.0035, EFS: P =
0.0007). Multivariable analyses confirmed ATP1B1high is an independent predictor
of shorter OS (P = 0.042) and EFS (P = 0.035). Analysis of another CN-AML cohort
confirmed that ATP1B1high is associated with shorter OS (P = 0.0046, n = 162). In
addition, up-regulation of oncogenes/onco-microRNAs such as MYCN, CCND2, CDK6,
KIT and miR-155, among others, was associated with ATP1B1high, which may be
indicative of ATP1B1’s leukemogenicity. Our results may improve risk stratification
and indicate new therapeutic targets for CN-AML.

INTRODUCTION

intensity necessary to optimize outcome, which is vital
for the future lives of CN‑AML patients. Consequently,
identification of new biomarkers remains an urgent
clinical need. In addition, considering that much about
leukemogenic mechanisms remains unknown, new
biomarkers that shed light on the underlying molecular
events may increase our understanding of myeloid
leukemogenesis.
Systematic screening for potential biomarkers has
been carried out using several bioinformatics approaches
with multiple GEO microarray datasets, and gene
signatures that showed both aberrant expression and
significant prognostic value were identified (See Figure
S1). We previously showed that high expression of ITPR2,
which encodes a key regulator of transmembrane calcium
ion (Ca2+) transport, was predictive of an adverse outcome
for CN-AML patients [15], which stimulated our interest
in regulators of metal ion transport.
ATP1B1 encodes Na,K-ATPase β subunit, an
integral membrane protein essential for establishing and

Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia
(CN-AML) accounts for 40-50% of all AML [1] and
shows significantly heterogeneous outcomes [2]. There are
no microscopically detectable chromosome abnormalities
in the leukemic blasts of CN-AML patients, but mutations,
epigenetic changes and dysregulated expression signatures
have been all found and used as biomarkers for prognostic
evaluation and risk classification [3]. These include
mutations of NPM1 [4], CEBPA [5] and FLT3-ITD [6],
as well as WT1 [7], DNMT3A [8] and TET2 [9], which
are associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Other genes,
microRNA and lncRNA [10] found to be associated with
prognostic outcomes include BAALC, ERG [11], WT1
[12], DNMT3B [13], TCF4 [14], ITPR2 [15], MAPKBP1
[16], miR-155 [17], CXXC5 [18], let-7a-2 and miR-188
[19]. These biomarkers are useful indicators of the degree
of malignancy in leukemia, and help focus targeted
therapies. However, they do not clarify the treatment

dividing the 157 CN-AML patients into subgroups based
the mutation status of FLT3, NPM1 or CEBPA (GEO No:
GSE6891) (Figure 1C), ATP1B1 showed significantly
higher expression in samples with FLT3-ITD (n = 66)
than without FLT3-ITD (n = 91) (p < 0.001). By contrast,
there was no significant difference in ATP1B1 expression
between NPM1-mutated (n = 82) and wild-type samples
(n = 75) (p = 0.644, Figure 1C), or between single CEBPAmutated (n = 5), double CEBPA-mutated (n = 16) and
wild-type samples (n = 133) (p = 0.376, p = 0.305 and
p = 0.492, respectively, Figure 1C). Finally, significantly
higher ATP1B1 expression was detected in the European
Leukemia Net (ELN) intermediate-I category than in the
ELN-favorable category (p = 0.003, Figure 1C).

maintaining the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients
across the plasma membrane. In addition, it was recently
reported that targeting of Na,K-ATPase β subunit could
induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [20], and that
impairment of the Na,K-ATPase β subunit increased the
incidence of apoptosis among leukemia cells [21, 22].
These results suggest that ATP1B1 expression may be a
useful indicator of prognosis in CN-AML patients.

RESULTS
Overexpression of ATP1B1 in CN-AML
Expression of ATP1B1 was significantly higher in
bone marrow (BM) from the primary cohort of 157 CNAML patients than in normal BM (p < 0.001, Figure 1A,
116 CN-AML vs. 5 normal BM, GEO No: GSE1159),
and similar results were obtained using other microarray
data (Figure 1B, 9 CN-AML vs. 10 normal BM vs. 10

and shorter EFS (P = 0.0007, Figure 3F). In addition,
ATP1B1high expressers were significantly associated with
shorter estimated OS/EFS at 3 years, whether among
the entire 157 CN-AML patient cohort or in the ELN
intermediate-I category (See Table S1).

After dividing the 157 CN-AML patients into two
groups based on the median ATP1B1 expression level,
ATP1B1high expressers showed significantly shorter
overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0068, Figure 3A) and eventfree survival (EFS) (P = 0.0039, Figure 3B). Further,
ATP1B1high expressers were respectively 1.56 times and
1.55 times as likely to die in the OS (P = 0.042) and EFS
(P = 0.035) multivariable models (See Table 2) after
adjustment of several known prognostic factors. We also
analyzed the prognostic impact of ATP1B1 expression
within ELN genetic categories. In the favorable group (n
= 59), no significant differences were detected for OS and
EFS (See Figure 3C and 3D). In the intermediate-I group
(n = 122), however, ATP1B1high patients were associated
with dramatically shorter OS (P = 0.0035, Figure 3E)

Confirmation that ATP1B1high is an unfavorable
biomarker using an independent cohort
The prognostic value of ATP1B1 expression
was further confirmed in an independent cohort of 162
CN-AML patients (GEO no: GSE12417), (P = 0.005,
See Figure S3). Using a cutoff of median expression,
ATP1B1high expressers belonged more to FAB M1 and less
to FAB M5 than ATP1B1low expressers (P = 0.005, P =
0.048, respectively). ATP1B1high was also associated with
higher expression of ERG, BAALC, MN1, WT1, TCF4,

patients based on the median ATP1B1 expression. In the

were down-regulated as compared to ATP1B1low (False

involved in leukemogenesis, including MYCN, KIT [29],
CCND2 and CDK6. The encoded proteins include a cyclin
kinase, two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP4K3,
MAPK7) and a tyrosine kinase (PTK7), which are involved
in regulating gene transcription and cell proliferation and
differentiation. Other up-regulated genes included CD34,
which acts as a marker for hematopoietic progenitor cells,
MPL, which initiates and maintains RUNX1-ETO AML
[30], CD200, whose up-regulation can promote AML
progression [31], SOX4, which is a key oncogenic target in
C/EBPα mutant AML [32], ETV6, which often cooperates
with other oncogenic signals to induce leukemia [33, 34],
and MAP7, which is targeted by miR-16 and regulates cell
proliferation and the cell cycle in several cancer cell lines
[35]. The down-regulated genes included BCL6, THAP2,
ICAM1 and CEBPD as well as those encoding members of
the toll-like receptor family (TLR4 and TLR8), which can
function in pathogen recognition and activation of innate
immunity, and CD14 and CD86, which can induce T-cell
activation and related immune responses (Figure 4A and
4B).
We used pathway data provided by MSgiDB
to evaluate cell signaling pathways associated with
ATP1B1high. Pathway expression was estimated as the
averaged expression of all involved genes. We found
that important apoptotic and natural killer signaling
pathways were significantly down-regulated, while RNA
polymerase and CML pathways were significantly up-

regulated (Figure 4E). These findings are consistent with
the gene dysregulation summarized above, and suggest
why ATP1B1 was associated with unfavorable outcomes
in CN-AML.

Genome-wide miRNA profiles associated with
ATP1B1 expression
Screening for differences in microRNA expression
using high-throughput sequencing data from 79 CNAML patients provided by TCGA, we identified 50
differentially expressed microRNAs (FDR < 0.05),
including 38 that correlated positively with ATP1B1
expression and 12 that correlated negatively (See Table
S4). Those positively correlated microRNAs included
miR-146b, miR-125b, miR-100 and miR-155 (P = 0.02).
MiR-146b binds to the 3’UTR of SMAD4, an important
member of TGF-β signaling pathway [36]. MiR-155 was
previously confirmed to be an independent biomarker of
a poorer prognosis in CN-AML [17]. Overexpression of
miR-125b was shown to independently induce leukemia
in a mouse model [37]. And miR-100 blocks the terminal
differentiation of myeloid cell by targeting RBSP3 [38].
The most negatively correlated microRNA was miR-582,
which reportedly inhibits bladder cancer progression [39].
Other negatively correlated microRNAs included miR-107
and miR-223. miR-107 targets CEBPA, which binds to the
promoter of miR-223, ultimately inhibiting differentiation

the known prognostic role of CEBPA mutations. Perhaps
there were too few samples with CEBPA mutations (5 with
single and 16 with double mutations), and the discrepancy
reflects an aberrant result that does not reflect the true
efficacy of CEBPA mutation as prognostic indicator.
We also demonstrated that high ATP1B1 expression
was an unfavorable prognostic biomarker for CN-AML
patients, based on clinical and molecular characteristics
prior to treatment and OS/EFS across the entire cohort or
within ELN categories. These results indicate that ATP1B1
expression could be used for risk stratification, not only
with respect to the entire CN-AML patient population,
but also within ELN intermediated-I categories, which
could facilitate design of more suitable therapies and
has important clinical significance. The prognostic value
of ATP1B1 was confirmed in another cohort of 162 CNAML patients. Moreover, to avoid possible distortion of
the microarray data, high-throughput sequencing data
from TCGA was used as a second independent validating
dataset, which included 41 CN-AML patients treated
with uniform chemotherapy (P = 0.039, See Figure S5).
All of these results show that overexpression of ATP1B1
is predictive of an adverse outcomes in CN-AML.
Because there are no recurrent chromosomal alterations,
CN-AML shows a degree of genetic uniformity, which
facilitates identification of new biomarkers but limits
the scope of their application. We therefore evaluated
the prognostic value of ATP1B1 in a cohort of 344 AML
samples containing a variety of karyotypes. Notably,
overexpression of ATP1B1 was associated with a shorter
OS and EFS (P = 0.027 and P = 0.0169, respectively. See
Figure S6), indicating that overexpression of ATP1B1 may
be an unfavorable biomarker in both CN-AML and AML.
To investigate the potential mechanisms by which
ATP1B1 expression affects patient outcome, we carried
out a multi-omics analysis. The first gene/microRNA
expression profiles and methylation loci associated with
ATP1B1 expression were determined, including related
cell signaling pathways. Many known oncogenes and
unfavorable CN-AML biomarkers were found to be upregulated, while various tumor suppressors and immune
factors were down-regulated. In addition, important
apoptotic and natural killer signaling pathways were all
significantly down-regulated, while RNA polymerase and
CML pathways were significantly up-regulated. These
aberrant changes to the transcriptome likely contribute to
the unfavorable outcomes for CN-AML.
MicroRNA-involved regulation and methylation
are important epigenetic mechanisms, which play
essential roles in many biologic processes, including
tumorigenesis. In this study, several microRNAs known to
be involved in tumorigenesis were found to be associated
with ATP1B1 expression, and may represent potentially
useful therapeutic targets. No methylation patterns
were associated with ATP1B1 expression. Perhaps,
demethylation agents would be of no use for patients

Genome-wide methylation profiles associated with
ATP1B1 expression
DNA methylation is an important epigenetic
mechanism that regulates gene expression, and some
methylation loci have been used to predict clinical
outcomes in CN-AML [3]. Considering that expression
of both DNMT3A and DNMT3B correlated positively
with ATP1B1 expression, we carried out a genomewide differential analysis to identify differences in the
methylation patterns between ATP1B1high and ATP1B1low
expressers based on a TCGA AML cohort of 74 CN-AML
patients. Surprisingly, comparison of the methylation
levels at several different regions (TSS200, TSS1500,
Promoter, Body, 3’UTR and 5’UTR, See Figure S4)
revealed no significant differences in methylation
associated with ATP1B1 expression status.

DISCUSSION
ATP1B1 encodes an integral membrane ion
pump responsible for maintenance of the Na+ and K+
electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane,
and contributes to the establishment of epithelial cell
polarity [41] and cell adherence. In an earlier study we
showed that strong expression of ITPR2, which encodes
a key membrane Ca2+ transporter, is predictive of an
unfavorable outcome in CN-AML [15]. The present study
demonstrates that overexpression of ATP1B1 may also
predict a poor prognosis in CN-AML patients. Together,
these studies suggest that metal ion (e.g., Ca2+, K+, Na+)
transport status has an important impact on outcome in
CN-AML.
Our first main finding is that ATP1B1 is more
strongly expressed in CN-AML than normal BM (Figure
1A and 1B), which suggests ATP1B1 plays an active role
during the pathogenesis of leukemia. The higher ATP1B1
expression was easily detected using qPCR, which is
readily applicable for clinical use. In addition, patients
with higher ATP1B1 expression were classified mainly
into the M1 and M2 FAB subgroups, with fewer in the
M5 subgroup, suggesting that ATP1B1high expressers
carry more immature cells, which likely indicates greater
malignancy. ATP1B1high is significantly associated
with FLT3-ITD and shows higher expression in ELN
Intermediate-I than in the Favorable category, which
are consistent with ATP1B1’s prognostic role. However,
ATP1B1 shows only a trend toward lower expression in
CN-AML patients with NPM1 mutation, as well as a slight
trend toward higher expression in patients with single or
double CEBPA mutation, which is not consistent with

strongly expressing ATP1B1.
In conclusion, our work demonstrates that
overexpression of ATP1B1 may be a useful unfavorable
biomarker for evaluating CN-AML outcomes. Because
of its higher expression in CN‑AML patients than healthy
individuals, ATP1B1 may be easily detected using qPCR
in clinical applications. Furthermore, our genome-wide
analysis of aberrant gene/microRNA expression and cell
signaling may lead to a better understanding of potential
leukemogenic mechanisms, thereby aiding development of
new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CN-AML.

[45], while the validating cohort of 162 CN‑AML patients
was evaluated using an Affymetrix HG-U133A array
[49]. High-throughput sequencing data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) were also used [50], including
mRNA, microRNA and methylation data.

Statistical analysis
Samples were divided into two groups (ATP1B1high,
n = 78; ATP1B1low, n = 79) based on the median ATP1B1
expression level. In addition, high and low classifications
of ERG, BAALC, WT1, LEF1, MN1, EVI1, DNMT3B,
TCF4, ITPR2, MAPKBP1 and MIR155HG were
determined according to the median expression of the
corresponding genes. When comparing the ATP1B1high
and ATP1B1low patient groups, Fisher’s exact test and the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to compare categorical
and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier and
log-rank test were used for survival analysis. Multivariable
Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the
time-to-event factors associated with survival endpoints.
Student’s t-test was used to identify ATP1B1-associated
genes, pathways and methylation sites. Pearson correlation
test was performed to detect correlated expression between
ATP1B1 and microRNA sequencing profiles. All analyses
were performed using R 3.1.1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples
This research was approved by the institutional
review boards at Weill Cornell Medical College and
Erasmus University Medical Center, and all patients
provided written informed consent in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki [47]. The study participants
were 157 primarily untreated CN-AML patients (median
age: 50 years, range: 16-77 years). Among them, 130
(83%) were aged < 60 years (younger patients) and 27
(17%) were ≥ 60 years (older patients). Patients were
uniformly treated according to the study protocols of the
Dutch-Belgian Hematology-Oncology Cooperative Group
(HOVON, http://www.hovon.nl). BM aspirates and PB
were collected at the time of diagnosis at the Erasmus
University Medical Center (Rotterdam) between 1990
and 2008 [45]. The samples all contained 80%-100%
blast cells after thawing [46]. To make a diagnosis of a
normal karyotype, more than 20 metaphases from BM
were examined using conventional cytogenetics. NPM1,
CEBPA, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations; FLT3-internaltandem
duplications (FLT3-ITD); and N-RAS, K-RAS and
FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD
[D835]) were all assessed. An independent validating
cohort of 162 CN-AML patients all received uniform
treatment (intensive double induction and consolidation
chemotherapy) based on the multicenter AMLCG-1999
trial of the German AML Cooperative Group between
1999 and 2003 [48]. The AMLCG-1999 clinical trials
were approved by the local institutional review boards,
and all patients provided written informed consent in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
