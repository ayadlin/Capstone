Abstract
Deregulation of protein synthesis is a hallmark of cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastatic progression.
eIF5A1 and its highly related isoform eIF5A2 are translation initiation factors that have been implicated in a range
of human malignancies, but how they control cancer development and disease progression is still poorly
understood. Here, we investigated how eIF5A proteins regulate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
pathogenesis. eIF5A proteins are the only known proteins regulated by a distinct posttranslational modiﬁcation
termed hypusination, which is catalyzed by two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine
hydroxylase (DOHH). The highly selective nature of the hypusine modiﬁcation and its amenability to pharmacologic inhibition make eIF5A proteins attractive therapeutic targets. We found that the expression and
hypusination of eIF5A proteins are upregulated in human PDAC tissues and in premalignant pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia tissues isolated from Pdx-1-Cre: LSL-KRASG12D mice. Knockdown of eIF5A proteins
in PDAC cells inhibited their growth in vitro and orthotopic tumor growth in vivo, whereas ampliﬁcation of eIF5A
proteins increased PDAC cell growth and tumor formation in mice. Small-molecule inhibitors of DHPS and DOHH
both suppressed eIF5A hypusination, preventing PDAC cell growth. Interestingly, we found that eIF5A proteins
regulate PDAC cell growth by modulating the expression of PEAK1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase essential for
PDAC cell growth and therapy resistance. Our ﬁndings suggest that eIF5A proteins utilize PEAK1 as a downstream
effector to drive PDAC pathogenesis and that pharmacologic inhibition of the eIF5A–hypusine–PEAK1 axis may
provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat this deadly disease. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6671–81. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
A widespread feature of cancer pathogenesis is deregulation
of protein synthesis, which is characterized by hyperactive
ribosome biogenesis and reprogramming of mRNA translation
in a manner that favors proliferation, survival, and metastasis
(1–3). Recent work has suggested that targeting regulatory
components of oncogenic protein synthesis represents an
effective antineoplastic strategy (1–4). One of the candidate
targets is eIF5A (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), an
18-kDa protein that is highly conserved from archae to
humans. eIF5A is indispensible for normal mammalian development, is involved in translation elongation and mRNA
transport, and is important for cell-cycle progression and
proliferation (5–10). Vertebrates carry two genes that encode

two highly homologous eIF5A isoforms, eIF5A1 and eIF5A2,
which in humans is 84% identical. eIF5A1 is ubiquitously
expressed in all tissues, whereas eIF5A2 expression is primarily
restricted to brain and testis (11).
Important recent work has shown that EF-P (translation
elongation factor P), the bacterial homolog of eIF5A,
alleviates ribosome stalling during the synthesis of polyproline motif-containing proteins (12, 13). Interestingly, the
pyrrolidine ring of proline imposes structural constraints on
the positioning of the amino acid in the peptidyl transfer
center, which reduces peptide bond formation, leading to
ribosome stalling. EF-P is proposed to alleviate this by
stabilizing peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome and by
optimizing the positioning of substrates. eIF5A has also
been reported to perform a similar function in yeast (14).
These ﬁndings suggest that a major function of EF-P/eIF5A
is to enhance and ﬁne-tune the production of a set of
polyproline tract-containing proteins. This unique modulatory function may be crucial for hyper-proliferating cancer
cells, which have substantial demands for oncogenic
and metabolic proteins containing polyproline domains.
Indeed, many cell cycle, apoptosis, and signal transduction
proteins contain polyproline regions (15–17). Increased
demands for such proteins may explain why eIF5A expression is increased in several cancers, including glioblastoma,
leukemia, liver, colon, lung, cervical, and ovarian cancer
(18–25).

It is notable that the mRNA translational activity of both
eIF5A proteins is uniquely regulated by the formation of an
unusual amino acid, hypusine [N-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)
lysine; refs. 11, 26]. Hypusine is formed by the transfer of
the butylamine portion of the polyamine, spermidine, to
the e-amino group of a speciﬁc lysine substrate of eIF5A,
which is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS).
Carbon 2 of the transferred 4-aminobutyl moiety is then
hydroxylated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). Each
step in the enzymatic reaction is amenable to speciﬁc
pharmacologic inhibition by N(1)-guanyl-1,7,-diamineoheptane (GC7), an inhibitor of DHPS, and ciclopirox olamine
(CPX), a bidentate iron chelator that inhibits DOHH (8,
26–28). The fact that eIF5A proteins are upregulated in
proliferating cancer cells, regulate translation of polyproline-containing proteins, and are the only proteins known
to be hypusine-modiﬁed make them attractive therapeutic
targets to treat cancer. Such new therapeutic targets and
strategies are sorely needed to treat pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3% to 5% (29). However, the role of eIF5A and
hypusine regulation has not been previously investigated in
PDAC. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to
determine whether eIF5A is critically involved in PDAC.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that eIF5A proteins are overexpressed and hypusinated in murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and human PDAC tissues. We
also demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of eIF5A
hypusination or genetic knockdown of eIF5A proteins
inhibits PDAC cell growth in vitro and orthotopic tumor
formation in vivo. Finally, we show that eIF5A proteins
control the expression of the novel tyrosine kinase PEAK1
(pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1; Sgk269), which
we have previously shown is overexpressed in human
PDAC tissues, and is critical for PDAC tumor growth,
metastasis, and gemcitabine resistance (30–33).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, siRNAs, and DNA constructs
Three PDAC cell lines (FG, PANC1, 779E) and human
pancreatic nestin expressing (HPNE) cells were used in this
study and maintained as described (30, 34). 779E cells were
established from a patient-derived tumor (moderately-topoorly differentiated PDAC) by A.M. Lowy. FG cells were kindly
gifted from Dr. David Cheresh (University of California, San
Diego, La Jolla, CA), whereas PANC1 cells and HPNE cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines
were regularly authenticated on the basis of morphologic and
growth characteristics as well as analysis of KRas mutation,
which was most recently conducted in March 2014. Details of
siRNAs and DNA constructs are in Supplementary Methods.
Antibodies, chemicals, and tissue microarrays
Antibodies directed at eIF5A1 [rabbit monoclonal (EP526Y):
ab32443] and eIF5A2 [mouse monoclonal (1E7): H00056648M01] were purchased from AbCam and Abnova, respectively.
Anti-Src and phospho-Src (Tyr416) antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology. Anti-GAPDH antibody was from Abcam,

6672

anti-survivin antibody was from Biolegend, anti-tubulin,
DHPS, and DOHH antibodies were from Sigma, anti-KRas
antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-30), and
anti-PEAK1 antibody was from Millipore. The antibody speciﬁcally recognizing hypusinated eIF5A1 (NIH353) was a kind
gift from Dr. Myung-Hee Park (NIH, Bethesda, MD), which has
been validated for use in Western blotting (35) and IHC (5, 36)
in human as well as mouse tissues and cell lines. GC7 (N1guanyl-1, 7-diaminoheptane) was purchased from Calbiochem,
and CPX (ciclopirox olamine) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cisplatin was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, and
gemcitabine was from Eli Lilly and used as described previously (30). Human pancreatic cancer tissue arrays were purchased from US Biomax (PA2081a except for DOHH staining,
where PA803 was used).
IHC
Human pancreatic cancer tissue array was purchased from
US Biomax as described above. PDX-1-Cre:LSL-KRASG12D
mouse pancreas sections were provided by A.M. Lowy. Samples
from patients BK-17 and BK-19 were collected and processed
as described previously (30), in accordance with University of
California, San Diego Institutional Review Board #071136X.
Determination of eIF5A1, eIF5A2, and hypusinated eIF5A1
protein expression was performed as described previously
using speciﬁc antibodies [ab32443 (Abcam) for eIF5A1,
H00056648-M01 (Abnova) for eIF5A2, and NIH353 for hypusinated eIF5A1; refs. 30, 35, 36]. Images were collected with a
Leica DM2500 microscope using a 40 objective lens.
Western blotting and qPCR
Western blotting and qPCR were performed as described
previously (30). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with
cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), and equal
amounts of cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with appropriate primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) for Western blotting. For experiments in Fig. 2B and C, cells were serum-starved overnight
before lysis to assess the effect of KRas activation without
stimulation from growth factors present in the serum. For
qPCR, mRNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and
RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using iScript
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). All PCR reactions were carried out using GoTaq Flexi DNA Polymerase kit (Promega).
Cell proliferation assay, soft-agar growth assay, and
clonogenic survival assay
Cell proliferation assay was performed using the CyQuant
Direct Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Invitrogen) as described in
Supplementary Methods. Soft-agar growth assay was conducted as detailed in Supplementary Methods, and the number
and size of colonies were analyzed using ImageJ software
(NIH). Clonogenic survival assay was performed by plating
cells without or with drug treatment into 6-well plates (50 cells/
well) and allowing them to form colonies, as described in

Orthotopic implantation experiments
Orthotopic implantation experiments were performed as
described previously (30) and detailed in Supplementary Methods. Brieﬂy, 1  106 cells were orthotopically injected into the
tail of the pancreas of 4 to 6 weeks old female athymic mice
(Jackson Laboratory), which were subsequently sacriﬁced at
the indicated time points to assess the weight of primary
tumors.

eIF5A1, eIF5A2, and hypusinated eIF5A are increased in
human and mouse PDAC tissues in response to activated
KRas
We ﬁrst sought to determine the relative expression levels of
hypusinated and total eIF5A proteins in normal and PDAC
tissues. Tissue microarrays (TMA) representing normal pancreatic and PDAC tissues were immunohistochemically stained
using antibodies speciﬁc to eIF5A1, eIF5A2, and the active,
hypusinated form of eIF5A1. Importantly, antibody speciﬁcity
to each eIF5A isoform was validated by Western blotting as
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A. Normal pancreatic ducts
showed only weak expression of eIF5A proteins or hypusinated
eIF5A1, whereas robust eIF5A protein expression and hypusination was observed in the majority of PDAC tissues regardless of
the differentiation status (Fig. 1A–C). These ﬁndings were
conﬁrmed in matched PDAC and adjacent uninvolved pancreatic tissues from the same patients (Fig. 1D–F). In contrast, we
found that the expressions of DHPS and DOHH are high in both
normal pancreatic ducts and PDAC tissues (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and S1C). In fact, there was no signiﬁcant difference

in DHPS levels between normal ducts and PDAC tissues, whereas DOHH levels were slightly decreased in PDAC tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These results indicate that eIF5A proteins
and hypusination levels are ampliﬁed in human PDAC compared with normal pancreatic duct tissues, without a concomitant increase in the expression of DHPS or DOHH.
Activating point mutations in the KRas proto-oncogene
are the primary oncogenic drivers in human PDAC (29, 37).
The Pdx-1-Cre;LSL-KRASG12D transgenic mouse model faithfully recapitulates early stages of PanIN development, which
are induced by KRas activation (38). We isolated pancreatic
tissues at various stages of PanIN development from these
animals and stained them with eIF5A1 and hypusinated
eIF5A1 antibodies. We were unable to determine the levels
of eIF5A2, due to the lack of a suitable antibody to mouse
eIF5A2. Interestingly, both eIF5A1 and hypusinated eIF5A1
are increased in PanIN tissues compared with normal pancreatic duct tissues (Fig. 2A). These ﬁndings suggest that
activated eIF5A1 is upregulated during early stages of PDAC
progression in response to KRas activation. In support of
these ﬁndings, introduction of KRasG12D into human pan-

creatic nestin-positive (HPNE) cells strongly increased
eIF5A1/2 protein levels and hypusination (Fig. 2B). In contrast, knockdown of activated KRas in PANC1 cells significantly reduced eIF5A1/2 protein levels and hypusination
(Fig. 2B). qPCR analysis showed a modest, but statistically
signiﬁcant, decrease of eIF5A1/2 mRNA levels in KRasdepleted PANC1 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that eIF5A upregulation by KRas can occur transcriptionally. In support of
these ﬁndings, Oncomine analyses revealed that eIF5A1/2
mRNA expression levels are increased in patient-derived
lung adenocarcinoma tissues with activated KRasG12D compared with those harboring wild-type KRas (Fig. 2D; ref. 39).
Taken together, these results indicate that KRas activation
upregulates eIF5A1/2 expression as well as hypusination
during the early stages of PDAC progression.
Inhibition of eIF5A expression or hypusination
suppresses PDAC cell growth, whereas overexpression of

PANC1 and 779E cells, respectively, whereas eIF5A2 depletion
reduced cell proliferation by 40% in both cell lines. These
results were conﬁrmed using an independent set of shRNAs
in PANC1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In addition, combined depletion of eIF5A1 by shRNA and eIF5A2 by siRNA
inhibited growth of PANC1 and 779E cells by approximately
60% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, depletion of
either eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 in PANC1 inhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as evidenced by the signiﬁcantly
reduced size of individual colonies (Fig. 4C). Finally, overexpression of eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 dramatically enhanced growth
of PANC1 cells (Fig. 4D) and 779E cells (data not shown). Time
course analyses conﬁrmed that eIF5A1/2 knockdown or overexpression mainly affects cell proliferation, not cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that eIF5A
proteins and hypusination are essential for anchorage-dependent and -independent growth in vitro.

established inhibitors of eIF5A hypusination that target DHPS
and DOHH, respectively (8, 18, 19, 26–28). Previous work has
shown that low micromolar doses of CPX induce growth arrest
and apoptosis in various cancer cells, as evidenced by
decreased survivin expression (40). Treatment of FG and
PANC1 cells with GC7 or CPX potently suppressed cell proliferation, eIF5A1 hypusination, and survivin expression in a
dose-dependent manner. Together, these ﬁndings indicate
that eIF5A hypusination is necessary for PDAC cell growth
in vitro (Fig. 3A–C).
To directly determine whether eIF5A protein expression is
necessary for PDAC cell growth in vitro, we depleted eIF5A1 or
eIF5A2 in PANC1 and 779E cells using speciﬁc shRNAs. Using
this approach, we were able to selectively deplete eIF5A1 by
greater than 80% and eIF5A2 by greater than 90% in both cell
lines (Fig. 4A). Importantly, eIF5A1 knockdown signiﬁcantly
suppressed cell growth by approximately 40% and 70% in

eIF5A is essential for PDAC tumor growth in vivo
To determine whether eIF5A proteins are essential for
PDAC tumor growth in vivo, PANC1 or 779E cells expressing control, eIF5A1, or eIF5A2 shRNAs together with GFP,
were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of nude
mice. Changes in tumor development were assessed using
ﬂuorescence whole-body imaging and by measuring primary weight of resected tumors. eIF5A1 depletion in
PANC1 and 779E cells reduced tumor weight by greater
than 50% compared with control tumors (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Similarly, eIF5A2 depletion in the
779E cells reduced tumor formation compared with control
tumors (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Also, eIF5A2
depletion in PANC1 cells reduced tumor formation, but did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 5A). The presence of
eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 knockdown in the orthotopic tumor
tissues was validated by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and S3D). These ﬁndings suggest that eIF5A1 is essential
for PDAC tumor growth, whereas eIF5A2 expression contributes to PDAC growth in vivo in a context-dependent
manner.
To determine the effect of overexpression of eIF5A proteins for PDAC tumor growth in vivo, we assessed orthotopic
tumor formation of PANC1 cells overexpressing eIF5A1 or
eIF5A2. As shown in Fig. 5C, the average tumor mass of
eIF5A1-overexpressing PANC1 cells was signiﬁcantly
increased compared with control tumors. eIF5A2 overexpression also enhanced tumor growth albeit to a lesser
degree (Fig. 5C). The presence of eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 overexpression in the tumor tissues was determined as above
(Supplementary Fig. S3E). Taken together, these ﬁndings
underscore the importance of eIF5A1 and eIF5A2 in driving
PDAC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

eIF5A regulates the expression of PEAK1, a novel
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
PEAK1 is a newly identiﬁed nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
that modulates Src kinase activity and plays an essential role
in driving PDAC malignancy (30–33). Like eIF5A, PEAK1 is
ampliﬁed in PanINs and PDAC patient tissues in response to
KRas activation (30). Interestingly, PEAK1 possesses a polyproline motif, suggesting that it could be translationally
regulated by eIF5A (12–14). This prompted us to determine
whether eIF5A is an upstream regulator of PEAK1 expression. Depletion eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 signiﬁcantly reduced
PEAK1 protein levels and Src activity in PANC1 and 779E
cells (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). These
results were conﬁrmed by eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 knockdown
using an independent set of shRNAs (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). In addition, simultaneous depletion of eIF5A1 by
shRNA and eIF5A2 by siRNA, as well as treatment with GC7
or CPX, also robustly inhibited PEAK1 expression and Src
activity compared with depletion of individual isoforms
(Fig. 6B and C). On the other hand, overexpression of eIF5A1
or eIF5A2 signiﬁcantly increased PEAK1 protein levels and
Src activity (Fig. 6D and data not shown). Collectively, these
results demonstrate that eIF5A is sufﬁcient and necessary
for PEAK1 protein expression in PDAC cells.

eIF5A–PEAK1 Mediates Pancreatic Cancer Pathogenesis

eIF5A–PEAK1 axis is essential to drive PDAC cell
proliferation in vitro
To determine whether PEAK1 is the downstream effector
of eIF5A in driving PDAC cell proliferation, we used two
independent approaches. First, we investigated whether
PEAK1 knockdown can offset the enhanced PDAC cell
proliferation induced by eIF5A overexpression. As shown
in Fig. 6E, PEAK1 knockdown reduced the proliferation of
eIF5A1- or eIF5A2-overexpressing cells by 50%. Second, we
investigated whether overexpression of PEAK1 could rescue
the antiproliferative effect of eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 depletion.
PANC1 cells expressing shRNAs were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-tagged PEAK1,
and subjected to Western blotting and cell proliferation
analyses (Fig. 6F). PEAK1 was successfully overexpressed in
PANC1 cells containing eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 shRNAs, which
rescued the antiproliferative effect of eIF5A1 or eIF5A2
depletion. Thus, exogenous introduction of PEAK1 was
sufﬁcient to overcome downregulation of PEAK1 in these
cells to drive cell proliferation. PEAK1 overexpression did
not affect cell proliferation in control PANC1 cells in a
statistically signiﬁcant manner, most likely because PEAK1
is expressed at high levels in these cells and forced expression of PEAK1 above the elevated endogenous levels may
not be sufﬁcient to promote PANC1 cell growth. However, it
signiﬁcantly enhanced cell proliferation in PANC1 cells with
eIF5A1 or eIF5A2 knockdown (Fig. 6F). Altogether, these
results indicate that PEAK1 is a necessary downstream
effector of eIF5A proteins in enhancing PDAC cell
proliferation.
Targeting eIF5A hypusination increases gemcitabine
sensitivity in PDAC cells in vitro
In our previous work, we demonstrated that knockdown of
PEAK1 renders PDAC cells sensitive to gemcitabine, the current ﬁrst-line chemotherapy for PDAC treatment (30). Having
determined the role of eIF5A in regulating PEAK1 levels, we

hypothesized that targeting eIF5A would increase sensitivity to
gemcitabine in both drug-resistant (PANC1) and -sensitive
(FG) PDAC cell lines (41). As shown in Fig. 7A–D and Supplementary Fig. S4C, inhibiting eIF5A hypusination with CPX
dramatically enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity in both lines.
In fact, IC50 value of gemcitabine decreased from 165 to 1.74
nmol/L and 12.4 nmol/L to 21.3 pmol/L upon cotreatment with
CPX in PANC1 cells and FG cells, respectively. Moreover, we
found that knockdown of eIF5A1, eIF5A2, or PEAK1 renders
PANC1 or FG cells signiﬁcantly more susceptible to gemcitabine (Fig. 7E and Supplementary Fig. S4D–F). Interestingly, we
found that gemcitabine treatment of resistant PANC1 cells
robustly increased eIF5A1 hypusination and PEAK1 protein
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7F). This
response was not observed in gemcitabine-sensitive FG cells
(Fig. 7F) and it was speciﬁc to gemcitabine, as treatment with
the DNA-damaging and cytotoxic agent, cisplatin, did not

eIF5A–PEAK1 Mediates Pancreatic Cancer Pathogenesis

Discussion
We report here that eIF5A protein ampliﬁcation is an early
component of PanIN development and a critical contributor to
PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. IHC analyses demonstrated
the upregulation of hypusinated and total eIF5A1 and eIF5A2
in patient-derived PDAC tissues (Fig. 1), suggesting an involvement of eIF5A proteins and their activity in PDAC oncogenesis.
eIF5A proteins function downstream of activating KRas mutations to drive PEAK1 protein expression, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase essential for PDAC progression (30). Pharmacologic
intervention of eIF5A activities inhibited PEAK1 expression as
well as proliferation of multiple PDAC cell lines. Together,
these ﬁndings implicate KRas/eIF5A/PEAK1 as a new signaling
module and therapeutic target functionally important for
human PDAC, which supports the emerging notion that eIF5A
hypusination can be therapeutically targeted to inhibit a wide
range of cancers, including those driven by oncogenic KRas
(18–21, 23, 24).
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that KRas activation is both
sufﬁcient and necessary for eIF5A protein ampliﬁcation in
PDAC cell lines (Fig. 2). Oncomine analyses also revealed that
eIF5A mRNA is increased in lung cancer patient tissues that
harbor activating KRas mutations (Fig. 2D), which accounts for
up to 30% of lung cancer cases (42). Together, these ﬁndings
suggest that oncogenic mutations in KRas promote eIF5A1/2
mRNA and protein expression in PDAC and possibly other
cancers where KRas is the oncogenic driver. In future work, it
will be important to determine how KRas signaling controls
eIF5A1/2 transcription and protein expression in cancer cells.
It will also be important to determine the precise role that
eIF5A proteins play downstream of KRas activation. In this
regard, important recent work showed that in bacteria and in
yeast, eIF5A and its counterpart EF-P, speciﬁcally facilitate the
translation of polyproline motif-containing proteins (12–14).
This raises the intriguing possibility that eIF5A proteins control gene expression in a specialized manner by modulating
translation of a subset of proteins with deﬁned signaling and
protein–protein interaction motifs. In fact, eIF5A depletion
only reduces global protein synthesis by approximately 5% in
mammalian cells (43). Thus, hyper-proliferating cancer cells
likely upregulate speciﬁc eIF5A proteins due to increased
demands for polyproline domain-containing proteins such
as Abl and PIK3R2 (15). Polyproline-containing proteins
are known to control oncogenic signaling by integrating
protein–protein interactions mediated by SH3 (Src homology-3), WW, and EVH1 (ENA/VASP Homology 1) domains
(15, 16). It is also interesting that the ability of eIF5A to
selectively regulate protein translation may extend beyond
polyproline domain containing proteins, as EF-P was recently shown to regulate the synthesis of proteins with other
motifs, including APP, YIRYIR, or GSCGPG (44). Altogether,
these ﬁndings suggest that regulation of eIF5A activity
provides an additional level of translational control for a
select set of proteins that drive PDAC cell growth and
oncogenesis in response to KRas activation. Our ﬁnding
that the expression of PEAK1, a polyproline domain-containing protein, is modulated by eIF5A in PDAC cells supports
this notion (Figs. 6A–D).

www.aacrjournals.org

We have previously shown that, like eIF5A, PEAK1 protein
expression is increased in PanINs, PDAC patient tissues, and
PDAC cell lines in response to KRas activation (30). PEAK1 is a
cytoskeleton-associated tyrosine kinase and scaffold protein
that transmits growth factor and integrin adhesion signals
from the cell's exterior, which is important for cell proliferation
and migration (30–33, 45). Our ﬁndings reported here demonstrate that PEAK1 is an important downstream mediator of
eIF5A function in PDAC cell proliferation. Knockdown or
pharmacologic inhibition of eIF5A proteins resulted in reduced
PEAK1 protein expression (Fig. 5), whereas overexpression of
eIF5A proteins upregulated PEAK1 levels (Fig. 6A) and
enhanced proliferation of PANC1 cells (Fig. 4D). Importantly,
enhanced cell proliferation by eIF5A overexpression was substantially, although not completely, offset by PEAK1 knockdown (Fig. 6E). In addition, PEAK1 overexpression restored cell
proliferation in eIF5A-depleted cells (Fig. 6F). These results
indicate that eIF5A proteins accelerate PDAC cell proliferation,
at least partially, through upregulation of PEAK1. Considering
the recent report showing the involvement of PEAK1 in basal
breast cancer oncogenesis (46), it will be of interest to determine whether the eIF5A–PEAK1 signaling axis is also important for the pathogenesis of breast cancer as well as other
cancers. Indeed, Oncomine analysis revealed that increased
expression of eIF5A isoforms together with PEAK1 is observed
across a broad spectrum of cancer types, including breast
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that the eIF5A–
PEAK1 axis may be a widely conserved mechanism that drives
tumorigenesis. In future work, it will be important to determine whether eIF5A proteins promote cancer pathogenesis by
modulating PEAK1's kinase activity and/or through its
reported scaffolding functions (31, 32, 45).
Our ﬁnding that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of
eIF5A increases gemcitabine sensitivity has important clinical
implications (Fig. 7A and B). Although gemcitabine is the ﬁrstline chemotherapy for PDAC, many patients display innate
resistance or acquire resistance during the course of treatment.
We found that in gemcitabine-resistant PANC1 cells, gemcitabine induced eIF5A hypusination and increased PEAK1
expression in a dose-dependent manner. These observations
indicate that gemcitabine-resistant cells may possess the
ability to activate the eIF5A–PEAK1 pathway upon exposure
to gemcitabine to promote survival. Importantly, inhibition of
eIF5A function by shRNA or CPX (Fig. 7B), in these gemcitabine-resistant cells, restored sensitivity to gemcitabine. Thus,
eIF5A–PEAK1 signaling contributes to gemcitabine resistance,
and eIF5A–PEAK1 expression may have utility as a biomarker
to identify gemcitabine-sensitive and -refractory patients.
However, they do not rule out the possibility that other pathways exist to regulate gemcitabine resistance/sensitivity in
PDAC cells.
Although we demonstrated that CPX inhibits PDAC cell
proliferation by targeting eIF5A, the underlying mechanisms
may be multifaceted. For example, the anticancer activities of
CPX are dependent, in part, on its iron-chelating activity, but
not as a general chelator of extracellular and/or intracellular
iron (47). Rather, CPX is a selective chelator of iron associated
with non-heme enzymes, including DOHH, ribonucleotide

reductase (RNR) and prolyl hydroxylase(s) (28, 48). Indeed, CPX
was reported to inhibit RNR, which is essential for DNA
synthesis, by iron chelation (40). The fact that RNR is irreversibly inhibited by gemcitabine (49) likely explains the potent
synergistic effects of CPX and gemcitabine in killing, not only
gemcitabine-resistant, but also gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC
cells (Fig. 7A). These ﬁndings suggest that hypusination inhibitors may have clinical applications in treating patients with
PDAC. Indeed, CPX is already approved by the FDA for use as
an antifungal agent and was recently shown to be relatively
safe for use in patients with cancer (50). In fact, no serious
health risks were observed in a recent open-label, ascending
dose phase I study, which evaluated the efﬁcacy of CPX in
treating patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic
malignancies (50). In light of these ﬁndings, additional studies
are warranted to determine whether CPX can be safely repurposed for use in patients with PDAC, alone or in combination
with gemcitabine.
In summary, there is an urgent need to understand the
detailed mechanisms that initiate and drive PDAC progression
so that speciﬁc diagnostic markers and new therapeutic strategies can be designed. Our ﬁndings provide new mechanistic
insights into PDAC development and drug resistance by implicating KRas/eIF5A/PEAK1 as a new signaling module and
functional biomarker that can be therapeutically targeted by
small-molecule compounds like CPX. The efﬁciency at which
the FDA could repurpose CPX and its reported safety in human
cancer patients could rapidly beneﬁt patients with PDAC that
suffer from this deadly disease.
