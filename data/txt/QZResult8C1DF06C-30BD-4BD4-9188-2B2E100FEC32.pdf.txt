Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor-a (ER-a),
progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2). However, pathways
responsible for downregulation of therapeutic receptors, as well as subsequent aggressiveness, remain unknown.
In this study, we discovered that lactoferrin (Lf) efﬁciently downregulates levels of ER-a, PR, and HER-2 in a
proteasome-dependent manner in breast cancer cells, and it accounts for the loss of responsiveness to ER- or
HER-2–targeted therapies. Furthermore, we found that lactoferrin increases migration and invasiveness of both
non-TNBC and TNBC cell lines. We discovered that lactoferrin directly stimulates the transcription of endothelin1 (ET-1), a secreted proinvasive polypeptide that acts through a speciﬁc receptor, ET(A)R, leading to secretion of
the bioactive ET-1 peptide. Interestingly, a therapeutic ET-1 receptor-antagonist blocked lactoferrin-dependent
motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. The physiologic signiﬁcance of this newly discovered Lf–ET-1 axis
in the manifestation of TNBC phenotypes is revealed by elevated plasma and tissue lactoferrin and ET-1 levels in
patients with TNBC compared with those in ERþ cases. These ﬁndings describe the ﬁrst physiologically relevant
polypeptide as a functional determinant in downregulating all three therapeutic receptors in breast cancer, which
uses another secreted ET-1 system to confer invasiveness. Results presented in this article provide proof-ofprinciple evidence in support of the therapeutic effectiveness of ET-1 receptor antagonist to completely block the
lactoferrin-induced motility and invasiveness of the TNBC as well as non-TNBC cells, and thus, open a remarkable
opportunity to treat TNBC by targeting the Lf–ET-1 axis using an approved developmental drug. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Among all breast cancers, approximately 10% to 15% are
categorized as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; refs. 1–3).
TNBC is characterized by the presence of low levels or absence
of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a), progesterone receptor (PR),

and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2; ref. 4),
and lack of effective therapies targeting these receptors leads
to poor prognosis (4, 5). While reviewing the previously published literature, we noticed evidence of an inverse correlation
between the levels of PR or ER-a and lactoferrin (Lf; ref. 6) in
endometrial adenocarcinomas or in primary breast tumors,
respectively (7–10). Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin
family, was ﬁrst discovered as an extracellular iron-binding
glycoprotein. Since then, lactoferrin has been extensively studied and shown to play a major role in anti-inﬂammation and
bactericidal events. Because lactoferrin is a hormone-responsive gene (11) and its levels are modulated by a variety of signals
(12), we hypothesized that elevated levels of lactoferrin may be
associated with a decreased expression of ER-a and PR and,
perhaps, HER-2 and, therefore, could contribute to the development of TNBC phenotypes. Considering lactoferrin's abundance in exocrine secretions and its proliferative potential
on certain cell types, in this study we aimed to investigate
the role of lactoferrin in the development of TNBC, and
discovered that lactoferrin efﬁciently downregulates the levels
of ER-a, PR, and HER-2 at a posttranscriptional level in
multiple breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we found that
lactoferrin-induced increased invasion of breast cancer cells

mechanistically mediated via transcriptional stimulation of
endothelin-1 (ET-1; ref. 13) and could be effectively blocked by
therapeutic antagonists of the ET-1 receptor. Although the
mechanism of loss of receptors during the development of
TNBC is currently understood poorly, our study provides an
insight into the molecules/pathways that could be responsible
for this progression and, consequently, could contribute to the
development of TNBC phenotypes.

Materials and Methods
Human patient samples
Dr. Susanne Fuqua (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,
Texas) provided human breast cancer tissue RNA samples. Dr.
George C. Prendergast (Lankenau Institute for Medical
Research, Wynewood, Pennsylvania) provided the plasma
samples along with the corresponding tissue slides. All the
human samples were used in accordance with the Institutional
Review Board procedures at the respective institutions.
Cell lines and cell culture
The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468, and SK-BR-3 and the colon cancer cell line
Caco-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained at 37 C in 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12-50/50
(Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologics) and 1% antibiotics (Gibco, Invitrogen). During serumstarvation, cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% antibiotics.
The TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 was selected for generating
stable clones. The cells were transfected with the following
plasmids: pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen; as control), ER-a, and HER-2.
The stable clone cell lines (pcDNA, ER, and HER-2) were
maintained in DMEM/F12-50/50, supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% antibiotics, and 0.5 mg/mL of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Protein analysis
For lactoferrin treatment, cells were maintained in serumfree DMEM for 48 hours and then treated with 20 mg/mL of
lactoferrin (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein samples were separated by
SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies used included: antiER-a (Bethyl Laboratories), anti-HER-2 (Bethyl Laboratories),
anti-PR (Dako), anti-IGF-IRb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.),
anti-RXRa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-cyclin D1
(Labvision/Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), anti-tubulin (SigmaAldrich), and anti-vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy
Deparafﬁnized sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol and subjected to antigen retrieval by
boiling the sections in antigen-unmasking solution (Vector
Laboratories). The sections were then blocked with 5%
skimmed milk in PBS (Mediatech Inc.) and incubated with
lactoferrin antibody (Lf-Ab; 1:500) or endothelin antibody
(1:100) at 4 C overnight, followed by incubation with EnVision
(Dako) for 1 hour at room temperature and visualization with

liquid DABþ substrate chromogen system (Dako). Immunostained sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted
with the use of the permount mounting medium.
For confocal imaging, ZR-75 or MCF-7 cells were plated onto
cover slips in 6-well plates, starved for 48 hours, and treated
with 20 mg/mL of lactoferrin. After a 12-hour treatment, the
cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in
0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum in
PBS. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies, washed
3 times in PBS, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse or
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa488 or Alexa-555 (Molecular Probes). 40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for nuclear staining. The slides were
then examined using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and
images were acquired with the help of Zen 2009 software.
Images were converted to TIFF format using Image J software.
Northern blotting
For Northern blotting, MCF-7 as well as MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with 100 mg/mL lactoferrin for
6 hours. A RNA sample amount of 20 mg was loaded onto a
formaldehyde denaturing gel (1.5% agarose, 2.2 mol/L formaldehyde). Subsequently, RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N
membrane (GE Healthcare UK Limited) and then immobilized
through covalent linkage to the membrane by UV cross-linker. A
complimentary RNA ET-1 probe was prepared using Ambion's
In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion, Inc.) with radiolabeled
UTP. Finally, the membrane was exposed to a phosphor imager
and the autoradiogram was developed using the Storm 865
Imager (GE Healthcare UK Limited). For another experiment,
MDA-MB-231 cells were plated and then serum-starved for 48
hours. The cells were either treated with 20 mg/mL of cycloheximide (CHX), 100 mg/mL lactoferrin, or both. CHX was
administered 1 hour before lactoferrin treatment. After 6 hours
of treatment with lactoferrin, RNA was isolated from the cells
using TRIzol method, and RNA levels were detected using the
Northern blotting protocol as described above.
Wound-healing assay
To analyze the effect of lactoferrin with or without tamoxifen
on cell migration, MCF-7 cells were plated with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS)–DMEM. Before treatment, each plate received
multiple "wounds" with a 200-mL pipette tip. Treatments were
carried out with low-serum medium supplemented with
100 mg/mL lactoferrin and 100 nmol/L tamoxifen (SigmaAldrich). In another set, the cells were treated with and without
lactoferrin in addition to 10 nmol/L of Herceptin (Genentech,
Inc.) and in combination. After 24 hours, each plate was
examined for the amount of wound closure by measuring the
physical separation remaining between the original wound
widths using the Olympus DP2-BSW digital camera software
(Olympus). Ten separate measurements were made per plate,
and each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
Migration assay
MCF-7 cells were serum-starved for 48 hours and then
resuspended in the presence of 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, 1 

Lactoferrin–Endothelin Axis in TNBC Phenotypes

105 cells/well were loaded onto the upper well of an uncoated
Boyden chamber. ET-1 and BQ123 were diluted in plain
medium before plating. The lower chamber was supplemented
with conditioned medium of NIH-3T3 ﬁbroblasts grown in
DMEM/F-12 medium with 0.1% BSA. After ﬁxation with methanol and staining with 0.05% crystal violet, the number of cells
that successfully migrated through the ﬁlter was counted. Data
were analyzed using the Olympus DP2-BSW digital camera
software.
Invasion assay
Cells were serum-starved for 48 hours and then seeded at a
density of 1  105 cells/well in the upper well of the Matrigel
Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences). At the time of the cell
seeding, each well was treated with 100 mg/mL of lactoferrin.
For E2 treatment, cells were serum-starved in phenol red–free
medium for 48 hours. At 6 hours before trypsinizing for
collection, the cells were treated with 100 mg/mL of lactoferrin.
After 24- to 48-hour incubation, the number of the invaded cells
was counted and the results were expressed as percentages of
control. For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the invaded cells
at the bottom were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained for DAPI after 48 hours.
Microarray analysis of lactoferrin-regulated genes
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were plated in triplicates, serum-starved for 48 hours, and then treated with 100
mg/mL of lactoferrin for 6 hours. RNA was isolated using TRIzol
according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA samples
were generated and hybridized onto an Affymetrix Human
Exon 1.0 ST Array chip. GeneSpring GX was used to process the
data and statistical analysis was carried out by means of an
unpaired t-test. A fold change of 1.5 was used to identify
differentially regulated genes and those with a P-value  0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Heat-map analysis of
the identiﬁed genes for individual arrays carried out using the
MultiExperiment viewer version 4.4 (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute).
Luciferase assay
MCF-7 as well as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
grown to 50% conﬂuency. ET-1 promoter, b-galactosidase, and
control plasmids were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). After
lactoferrin treatment, cell lysates were prepared using 200 mL
of Tropix Lysis solution (Applied Biosystems). For luciferase
promoter activity, 10 mL of lysate was incubated with 100 mL
Luciferase Assay Substrate solution (Promega) and measurements were taken using LUMAT LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). b-Galactosidase was used as a transfection
control.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
PCR-ampliﬁed DNA fragments or oligos containing lactoferrin consensus sites were 50 -end labeled using g 32p and PNK
enzyme. End-labeled fragments were puriﬁed using sephadex
G-50 spin columns (GE Healthcare UK Limited). Each fragment
was incubated with puriﬁed holo- or apo-lactoferrin–treated

(GenWay Biotech) or lactoferrin-treated as well as untreated
nuclear extracts for 15 minutes at room temperature. The
reaction samples were resolved on a 5% native PAGE for 2
hours. Gels were removed and dried and exposed to phosphor
imager. The ﬁnal images were developed using the Storm 865
Imager (GE Healthcare UK Limited).
Plasma protein detection using ELISA
For detection of lactoferrin, the AssayMax Human Lactoferrin ELISA Kit (AssayPro) was used with a 1:100 dilution of
serum samples. ET-1 levels were measured using the QuantiGlo Human Endothelin-1 Kit (R&D Systems) by following the
manufacturer's manual of instructions. For ET-1 levels, the
1450 Microbeta Jet Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence
Counter (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) were used
to measure the luminescence. A dilution of 1:5 for the serum
was used for the ET-1 ELISA assay.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from human breast tumor tissue samples as well
as human breast cancer cell lines was isolated using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. A
2-mg RNA sample was used to synthesize cDNA using Invitrogen's SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix by following the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers
(synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich) were used for target genes:
lactoferrin forward: 50 -ACCGCAGACATGAAACTTGT-30 and
lactoferrin reverse: 50 -GGGGGAGTCTCTCTTTATGC-30 ; ET-1
forward: GCCAAGGAGCTCCAGAAACAGCAG ET-1 reverse:
AGCAGGAGCAGCGCTTGGAC; actin forward: 50 -TCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGA-30 ; and actin reverse: 50 -GTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAG-30 . Normalized expression of target genes
were calculated relative to endogenous expression of actin
(relative expression ¼ 2ðDCt Þ ).
Statistical analysis
Paired Student t test was used for statistical signiﬁcance of
differences in numerical data. All of the statistical tests were 2sided. P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Lactoferrin downregulates ER-a, PR, and HER-2
receptor in human breast cancer cells
Although a large body of studies have ﬁrmly established the
signiﬁcance of the loss or reduced expression of ER-a, PR, and
HER-2 in TNBC, the nature of the endogenous molecule(s) that
might be responsible for the downregulation of these therapeutic receptors and, thus, progression of breast cancer cells to
more invasive phenotypes, remains unknown. As a ﬁrst step to
explore this hypothesis, we examined the effect of recombinant
iron-saturated lactoferrin on the levels of the 3 receptors in ERpositive ZR-75 breast cancer cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1A,
lactoferrin stimulation of breast cancer cells results in a timedependent downregulation of ER-a, PR, and HER-2 starting 6
hours post treatment. Interestingly, levels of ER-a and HER-2
returned to basal levels in the treated cells after 24 hours. The

noted downregulation of these receptors by lactoferrin was not
due to a generalized toxicity as there was no effect of lactoferrin
on the levels of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-IRb and
retinoid X receptor a (RXRa) receptors, whereas lactoferrin
stimulation was accompanied by increased expression of
cyclin D1, implying an active cell-cycle progression of lactoferrin-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we did not observe
any evidence of an inhibitory effect of lactoferrin on the overall
protein synthesis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The observed
downregulation of therapeutic receptors by lactoferrin was
not limited to ZR-75 cells because lactoferrin also downregulated the basal levels of ER-a, PR, and HER-2 in ER-positive
MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B) as well as in HER-2positive ER-negative breast cancer SK-BR-3 or colon cancer
Caco-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Because downregulation of therapeutic receptors by a single dose of lactoferrin was
transient in nature, we next assessed whether noted downregulation of receptors could be sustained by repeated lactoferrin dosing or by increasing the dose of lactoferrin. We found
that replenishing the cultures with fresh or higher doses of
lactoferrin results in a sustained downregulation of ER-a, PR,
and HER-2 (Fig. 1B). To validate these ﬁndings, we conﬁrmed
downregulation of all 3 receptors in ZR-75 (Fig. 1C) or MCF-7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D) by immunocytochemical staining and scanning confocal microscopic examination. Together,
these ﬁndings indicate that persistent stimulation of breast
cancer cells by lactoferrin may downregulate therapeutic
receptors, and thus, in principle, may contribute, to the development of TNBC phenotypes.

Posttranscriptional regulation of therapeutic receptors
by lactoferrin
To understand the underlying basis of lactoferrin downregulation of therapeutic receptors, we examined the effect of
lactoferrin on the levels of receptor mRNA by Northern hybridization. There is no signiﬁcant inhibitory effect of lactoferrin
treatment on the levels of ER-a, PR, and HER-2 mRNA (Fig. 2A).
For subsequent studies, we decided to examine the effect of
lactoferrin on ER-a and HER-2 as models of therapeutic
receptors in TNBC. In addition, there was no effect of lactoferrin on the half-life of the newly synthesized 35S-labeled ER-a
or HER-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1E). However, cotreatment of
the cells with a proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132, prevented
lactoferrin-induced dose- and time-dependent downregulation of ER-a and HER-2 protein (Fig. 2B), indicating that the
lactoferrin-mediated notable reduced expression of ER-a or
HER-2 may use mechanisms that are sensitive to inhibitors of
proteasomal degradation of proteins. To further validate the
posttranscriptional control of ER-a and HER-2 by lactoferrin,
we next generated isogenic pooled clones of MDA-MB-231 cells
stably expressing ER-a or HER-2 (Fig. 2C). We found that
lactoferrin treatment of clones is also accompanied by downregulation of ectopically expressed ER-a and HER-2 (Fig. 2D),
which indicates that lactoferrin uses posttranscriptional mechanism(s) to downregulate HER-2 or ER-a in breast cancer cells.
Lactoferrin promotes invasiveness of breast cancer cells

progression, indicated that lactoferrin exposure to ZR-75 cells
may promote cell-cycle progression. Indeed, we found that
lactoferrin treatment of ZR-75 cells leads to an accelerated
transition into S-phase compared with untreated control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). As lactoferrin stimulation of breast
cancer cells was accompanied by downregulation of ER-a, PR,
and HER-2 receptor, characteristic of TNBC (Fig. 1A), we
hypothesized that lactoferrin stimulation of ER-positive cells
may antagonize the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to
tamoxifen. In support of this notion, we showed that serum
induced cell migration as well as estrogen-mediated invasion
of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A and C, respectively) or ZR-75 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) could be effectively blocked by
tamoxifen. However, this action of tamoxifen was compromised when cells were pretreated with lactoferrin, which
downregulates ER-a and, consequently, is the target of tamoxifen (Fig. 3A and C; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similarly, to
understand the implication of lactoferrin-mediated downregulation of HER-2 on the ability of cells to respond to HER-2–
directed therapies such as Herceptin, we next showed that
lactoferrin pretreatment of HER-2–positive breast cancer cells
reduced the effectiveness of Herceptin to inhibit serum-stimulated cell migration and heregulin-induced invasion in MCF-7
cells (Fig. 3B and D, respectively) and in ZR-75 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results indicate that lactoferrin
stimulation of ER- or HER-2–positive breast cancer cells is
accompanied by the loss of responses to tamoxifen or Herceptin, presumably due to the loss of its target receptors (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Fig. S2C). However, because we did not observe
a complete loss of sensitivity of lactoferrin-treated cells to

www.aacrjournals.org

tamoxifen or Herceptin, we hypothesized that lactoferrin could
possibly be contributing to the increase in migration and
invasion (14) independent of receptor downregulation. Therefore, we presume that lactoferrin is involved in the activation of
a gene(s) that could augment migration and invasion of these
breast cancer cells. On the basis of these results, as suspected,
lactoferrin strongly promoted the migration and invasiveness
of TNBC lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 as
evaluated by the wound-healing or Matrigel invasion assays
(Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig. S2D), indicating the involvement
of receptor-independent activation of promigration/proinvasion gene(s).
Lactoferrin stimulates ET-1 transcription
To gain insight into the molecular basis of lactoferrininduced cell invasiveness of TNBC, we next determined the
nature of lactoferrin-regulated genes using microarray analysis
of lactoferrin-treated or untreated MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 4A). This analysis led to the identiﬁcation of 3
lactoferrin-regulated genes (i.e., Et-1, Rgs-2, and Tcbp-1) in both
the cell lines (Fig. 4B). Guided by the functions of these genes in
the context of our ﬁndings in this study, we decided to focus on
ET-1 (15), a vasoactive peptide ﬁrst isolated from vascular
endothelial cells (15) that is upregulated in certain human
cancers (16,17) including breast cancer (18). We found that,
indeed, lactoferrin increased the steady-state levels of ET-1
mRNA in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 (Fig. 4C).
Lactoferrin-induced increased ET-1 mRNA expression could
not be blocked by the inclusion of a protein-synthesis inhibitor,

lactoferrin. Consistently, lactoferrin also stimulated the transcription driven by the ET-1 promoter-luc in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 5A). A close scanning of the ET-1 promoter revealed the
presence of 3 lactoferrin-motifs in the ET-1 promoter. Results
from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using
oligonucleotides encompassing all 3 potential lactoferrininteracting DNA regions (Supplementary Fig. S3A) in the
ET-1 promoter indicated the formation of speciﬁc lactoferrin–DNA complexes with all 3 sites (Fig. 5B). On the basis of

this, next we individually mutated lactoferrin consensus
motifs 1 to 3 in the full-length ET-1 promoter-luc and found
no signiﬁcant impairment in the ability of lactoferrin to
stimulate the transcription of ET-1 with promoter mutant
sites 1 and 2 in comparison with consensus motif number 3.
This indicates that lactoferrin may preferentially use lactoferrin consensus motif number 3 to stimulate ET-1 transcription
(Fig. 5C). To identify the speciﬁc base-pair in the functional

lactoferrin-binding, we created 3 mutant versions of the lactoferrin consensus site 3 and tested these oligos for lactoferrinbinding using EMSA (Supplementary Fig. S3A). There was a
drastic reduction in the binding of lactoferrin to oligo number
3, indicating that lactoferrin may preferentially interact with
the GGCACTTGG motif in the ET-1 promoter (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we observed a progressive increase in the levels of
protein–DNA complexes that could be effectively super-shifted
by inclusion of Lf-Ab but not isogenic immunoglobulin G
(IgG; Fig. 5E, lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, only recombinant
iron-saturated lactoferrin (holo-Lf), but not non-iron saturated
Lf (apo-Lf), interacted with the ET-1 promoter oligo (Fig. 5F),
and such protein–DNA complexes could be super-shifted by LfAb (Fig. 5E, lanes 9–12). Consistent with these ﬁndings, ironsaturated holo-Lf and not apo-Lf downregulated ER-a and
HER-2 in ZR-75 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together,
these ﬁndings establish that ET-1 is a lactoferrin-inducible
gene and that only the holo form of lactoferrin is responsible
for the observed downregulation as well as increased invasiveness in breast cancer cells. This is particularly interesting
because a study by Duarte and colleagues (19) showed that
treatment of human breast cancer cell lines, Hs578T and T47D,
with bovine apo-Lf increased apoptosis and decreased cell
migration. However, as indicated in our present data, we
observed an upregulation of ET-1, which is responsible for the
lactoferrin-induced invasion and migration, with the holo form
of lactoferrin only. Consistent with these results, apo-lactoferrin did not bind to the ET-1 promoter and, subsequently,
was unable to drive the transcription of the gene. Therefore,

www.aacrjournals.org

we propose that the increase in invasion, as well as migration,
in breast cancer cells is likely to be due to the upregulation
of ET-1 after iron-saturated lactoferrin treatment.
Lf–ET-1 axis promotes TNBC phenotype
To establish the physiologic relevance of lactoferrin stimulation of ET-1, we next showed that lactoferrin-mediated
increase in expression of ET-1 was also accompanied by a
signiﬁcant accumulation of ET-1 in the conditioned media.
Interestingly, the levels of baseline ET-1 in TNBC lines such as
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were substantially higher
than that in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A). To assess the signiﬁcance
of secreted ET-1 in the observed lactoferrin-mediated migration, we determined the effect of an antagonist of the ET-1
receptor [ET(A)R (20) BQ123 (21–23)], on the action of lactoferrin. We found that inclusion of BQ123 in the cultures
abrogated the ability of lactoferrin as well as of recombinant
ET-1 to promote migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells in the
Boyden chamber (Fig. 6B) as well as in the Matrigel invasion
(Fig. 6C) assays, respectively.
To assess the signiﬁcance of these observations in a physiologic setting, we determined the status of lactoferrin in
human breast tumors from patients with TNBC or ERþ/PRþ
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We found that the
levels of lactoferrin (Fig. 7A) as well as ET-1 (Fig. 7B) were
signiﬁcantly increased in TNBC specimens compared with
those in the control ERþ/PRþ breast tumors. Because both
lactoferrin and ET-1 are secreted polypeptides, we next determined the levels of lactoferrin and ET-1 in the plasma samples

from TNBC as well as from ER/PR/HER-2–positive patients.
We observed an elevated level of ET-1 as well as lactoferrin in
TNBC when compared with the ER/PR/HER-2–positive samples (Fig. 7C). Consistent with these ﬁndings, we also found
strong and medium matching staining of lactoferrin and ET-1
in TNBC samples when compared with ER-a, PR, and HER-2–
positive tissue samples as determined by immunohistochemistry. Data in Fig. 7D illustrate representative examples of
increased levels of lactoferrin and ET-1 staining in the tumor
specimens from patients with TNBC as compared with the ER/
PR/HER-2–positive tumors, providing a proof-of-principle evidence of a correlative nature of lactoferrin and ET-1 in tumor
samples. Collectively, these ﬁndings revealed that lactoferrinmediated increase in invasiveness of breast cancer cells is
mediated via increased expression and secretion of ET-1, at
least in part, and these changes might account for the generally
noted aggressive behavior of TNBC (Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Findings presented in this article show for the ﬁrst time
that lactoferrin, a ubiquitous secretory protein, can downregulate all 3 therapeutic receptors, ER-a, PR, and HER-2, in
breast cancer cells. This observation is particularly interesting as it raises the possibility that increased expression of
lactoferrin could contribute to the development of TNBC
phenotypes due to the loss or downregulation of these
receptors. Because we have also observed an increased
expression of lactoferrin in tumor specimens as well as in
the levels of circulating lactoferrin in plasma samples from
the patients with TNBC as compared with those in samples
from ERþ patients, we hypothesize a potential contributing
role of lactoferrin in supporting the TNBC phenotype. In this
context, it is noteworthy that an earlier correlative report,
dating back to the 1990s, has shown an inverse relationship

between the levels of ER-a and lactoferrin (7). In addition,
there are immunocytochemical studies that show changes in
the synthesis and secretion of lactoferrin in breast cancer
(24); however, in endocervical adenocarcinoma, lactoferrin
has been identiﬁed as a useful predictive marker (25).
Furthermore, while our studies were being conducted,
Schulz and colleagues have also noticed an increased expression of lactoferrin in samples of patients with TNBC (26).
Our ﬁnding that lactoferrin stimulation of both non-TNBC
and TNBC cells was accompanied by an increased invasiveness
is of particular importance as it indicates the possibility that
the loss of the 3 receptors by lactoferrin is not only associated
with an expected insensitivity to antiestrogen or Herceptin but
also contributes to invasiveness of breast cancer cells—both
central features of TNBC.
While exploring the molecular basis of lactoferrin-induced
invasion of breast cancer, we identiﬁed lactoferrin-regulated
genes using a microarray approach. These and other molecular studies presented in this article led to the identiﬁcation

www.aacrjournals.org

of ET-1, another secreted protein, as the newest direct target
of lactoferrin. This is particularly exciting as ET-1 has been
previously shown to promote breast cancer progression, and
increased amounts of ET-1 participates in the process of
invasion and metastasis, and ET-1 levels correlate well with
a diminished disease-free and overall survival rate (18). ET-1
exerts its biologic effects through an autocrine and/or
paracrine manner through speciﬁc receptors and supports
tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and neovascularization (27–33). The relevance of these mechanistic
studies to a physiologic setting was recognized by the noted
co-overexpression of lactoferrin and ET-1 in tumors as well
as elevated circulating levels in serum from TNBC as compared with samples from ER-, PR-, and HER-2–positive
breast tumors.
Because the ET-1 pathway is being actively targeted via
speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibitors to its receptor and Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ET-1 receptor antagonists are moving forward in clinical trials, these studies raise a
