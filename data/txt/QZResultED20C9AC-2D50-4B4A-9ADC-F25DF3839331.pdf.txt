Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human EGFR 2 (HER2) have an important role in
the initiation and progression of various types of cancer. Inhibitors targeting these receptor
tyrosine kinases are some of the most successful targeted anticancer drugs widely used for cancer
treatment; however, cancer cells have mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance that
pose as major obstacles in drug efficacy. Extensive studies from both clinical and laboratory
research have identified several molecular mechanisms underlying resistance. Among them is the
role of signaling cross-talk between the EGFR/HER2 and other signaling pathways. In this review,
we focus particularly on this signaling cross-talk at the receptor, mediator and effector levels, and
further discuss alternative approaches to overcome resistance. In addition to well-recognized
signaling cross-talk involved in the resistance, we also introduce the cross-talk between EGFR/
HER2-mediated pathways and pathways triggered by other types of receptors, including those of
the Notch, Wnt and TNFR/IKK/NF-κB pathways, and discuss the potential role of targeting this
cross-talk to sensitize cells to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are cell-surface transmembrane proteins that consist of an
extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The
functions of RTKs are essential to normal cell physiology, such as cell proliferation,
metabolism and differentiation. Among various RTKs, the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and the human EGFR 2 (HER2, also known as ErbB2) are frequently upregulated
or mutated in a broad spectrum of cancer types and possess aberrant activities that lead to

cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation.1,2 For example, EGFR is
frequently mutated in lung cancer and brain tumors or overexpressed in lung, colon, head
and neck, brain, pancreas and breast cancers,3–6 and HER2 is often overexpressed in breast,
gastric, esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.7,8
Regardless of the diverse array of mutations, cancer cells frequently exhibit dependency on
a particular signaling pathway that is driven by mutation or overexpression of a single
protein. This phenomenon is referred as ‘oncogene addiction’,9 a concept that is essential to
cancer targeted therapy in the clinical and laboratory research. For instance, lung cancer
cells with activated mutation in EGFR are dependent on EGFR for their survival, and
inhibition of EGFR activity induces drastic cell death and growth arrest in cultured cells and
tumor regression in lung cancer patients harboring mutated EGFR.10–12 In contrast, lung
cancer patients with wild-type EGFR exhibit little or no response to the same treatment,
limiting EGFR-targeted therapy only to lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation. In
general, effective molecularly targeted therapy requires identifying the appropriate
predictive biomarkers and selection of patients based on these identified biomarkers, which
can substantially increase drug efficacy and improve patient survival.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, for example, gefitinib and erlotinib) and EGFR
monoclonal antibodies (for example, cetuximab and panitumumab) have been approved for
clinical usage.13 Erlotinib is currently used to treat patients with EGFR-mutant non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer, and cetuximab is used to treat colon and
head and neck cancers with wild-type K-RAS. Lapatinib (TKI) and trastuzumab (monoclonal
antibodies) are approved for treating HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.14 While these
treatment strategies have significantly improved patient survival, a majority of patients
eventually experience disease recurrence when drug resistance develops. To combat
resistance, other alternative and more effective combinational treatment strategies based on
known molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance have been investigated in clinical
trials.15 However, the innate and acquired resistance to targeted agents remain the biggest
challenges in cancer therapy.
In this review, we provide a brief description of various EGFR and HER2 signaling
pathways that are either current or potential drug targets. Furthermore, we highlight the
significance of signal crosstalk in resistance to targeted therapy. In addition, we describe
some rationally designed therapies that target multiple signaling pathways and have the
potential to provide more effective personalized cancer treatment to overcome drug
resistance.

KEY SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION FROM RTK TO MAINTAIN CANCER CELL
SURVIVAL AND GROWTH
Signal transduction is a series of biochemical modifications of biomolecules, such as
proteins, lipids and nucleic acid, through which cells alter intracellular physiology in
response to various external stimuli including a number of growth factors and cytokines.
The signals from the extracellular stimuli induce overall alterations in gene expression
profiles, resulting in outcomes such as cell proliferation, growth and migration. In the last
few decades, the molecular components of the key downstream signaling pathways from the
HER family of receptors have been extensively studied, and several key signaling pathways
regulating the functions of these receptors have been identified.
Activation of EGFR family proteins is regulated by ligand binding with the exception of
HER2, which dimerizes independently of ligands.16,17 Once dimerization occurs,
intracellular tyrosine kinases are fully activated and induce autophosphorylation in their

tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosines function as docking sites for several
adapter proteins, such as GRB2 and SHC, which further transduce the signaling pathways
through protein–protein interaction and post-translational modifications.18 Ultimately,
EGFR and HER2 activate multiple signaling pathways, including RAS, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K), PKC, Src and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
Among them, the most investigated downstream pathways in cancer are RAS/RAF/MEK
and PI3K/AKT. The key molecules in these signaling pathways, RAS, RAF and PI3K,
function as oncogenic proteins and are frequently mutated or activated, even in cancers in
which RTKs are not activated.19–21 Furthermore, cancer cells with K-RAS or PIK3CA
mutation exhibit resistance to RTK inhibitors, but simultaneous inhibition of both PI3K/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and MEK has been shown to sufficiently induce
apoptotic cell death in lung cancers harboring EGFR mutant.22

The signals from a single RTK activation are amplified at multiple downstream points rather
than in a single linear manner. At the receptor level, a phosphorylated RTK recruits and
phosphorylates multiple proteins and augment the signaling by each protein, which results in
different signal transduction. Major mediator kinases downstream of RTKs also
phosphorylate multiple targets to activate or inactivate them, leading to further amplification
of the signaling pathways. Downstream effectors including transcription factors and other
enzymes then induce multiple target gene expression. Thus, the cross-talk of the signaling
from RTKs with many other signaling pathways can occur at various points. To simplify the
signaling cross-talk in RTK signaling that may affect drug resistance, we categorized three
types of cross-talk at different levels: receptor, mediator and effector (Figure 1). Cross-talk
at the receptor level occurs when other types of activated or amplified RTKs, which have the
same downstream targets, compensate for the inhibition of targeted RTK. When resistance
occurs at the mediator level, constitutive activation or inactivation of mediators due to
various mutations or deletions can transduce active signaling independently of RTK.
Resistance at effectors level occurs when other signaling pathways alter the activity of
critical effectors involved in the survival or cell growth controlled by RTK signaling. In the
next sections, we will further introduce the several mechanisms of the resistance to EGFR/
HER2 inhibitors that are found in clinical samples and/or experimental systems, and discuss
the possible roles of signaling cross-talk.

IDENTIFIED MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF THE RESISTANCE TO EGFR/
HER2 INHIBITORS
Resistance through cross-talk at the receptor level

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One common mechanism of resistance to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors is the upregulation or
activation of alternative RTKs. In EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, these types of acquired
TKI resistance arise from the amplification of MET and HER2, and upregulation of
AXL.23–27 FGFR and IGF-1R activation are also implicated in EGFR TKI resistance in
NSCLC.28,29 In colon cancer, MET, IGF-1R and HER2 amplification have been shown to be
associated with cetuximab resistance.30–32 Trastuzumab resistance in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells has been attributed to the activation of EGFR, HER3, EphA2 and
IGF-1R.33–35 In addition to the RTKs over-expression, RTK ligands, such as NRG1, HGF
and, FGF, whose expressions are increased through autocrine signals from tumor cells or
paracrine signals from stroma, can reverse the sensitivity to EGFR/HER2 TKIs in these
receptor-addicted cells.36 Interestingly, treatment of cancer-related and chemotherapyinduced anemia and fatigue by using human recombinant erythropoietin was shown to
confer resistance to trastuzumab in breast cancer cells via Jak2-mediated activation of Src
and inactivation of PTEN.37

The above-mentioned examples of resistance all belong to cross-talk at the receptor levels
(Figure 2). The signaling from alternative RTKs such as MET, IGF-1R, FGFR and EphA2
can maintain the key cell survival and/or proliferation signals in the RAS/RAF/MEK and
PI3K/AKT pathways.23–26,33 Both the pathways can be inhibited by simultaneously
blocking EGFR/HER2 and the alternative RTKs in the resistant cells, which results in
cancer cell death or growth arrest.23–26,33 Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of two or more
RTKs by combination therapy may be necessary to provide a more effective strategy to
overcome this type of drug resistance.
Resistance through cross-talk at the mediator level

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another common mechanism of resistance involves the direct activation of mediators in the
RAS/RAF/MEK or PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 2). K-RAS mutation is most frequently
observed mutation in oncogenic drivers. Lung and colon cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS exhibit intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibitors.38–40 Interestingly, K-RAS mutation is
also associated with acquired resistance to cetuximab in colon cancer patients.41,42
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling reactivation by either amplification of
MAPK1 or downregulation of negative regulators of ERK is related to TKI resistance in
lung cancer cells.43 Mutation in B-RAF is found in acquired resistance to TKI in lung cancer
patients with mutated EGFR.44 In many types of cancer, oncogenic PI3K is frequently
activated,45 and PTEN, a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of PI3K, is often deleted
or inactivated.46 In breast cancer, deletion or mutation of PTEN or oncogenic mutation of
PIK3CA has been shown to associate with resistance to HER2 inhibitors.47,48 Clinical trial
data have demonstrated that PTEN loss is significantly associated with poor trastuzumab
response and survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.49 In EGFR-mutated
lung cancers, PIK3CA mutation is also linked to acquired resistance to EGFR TKI.50
Interestingly, family with sequence similarity 83 members A and B (FAM83A and
FAM83B) have recently been shown to contribute to TKI resistance in breast cancer cells
through the upregulation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling.51,52 Moreover, the E3 ligase Skp2
SCF complex has also been demonstrated to regulate AKT ubiquitination and activation, and
the inhibition of Skp2 can sensitize HER2-overexpressing tumors to trastuzumab in vivo.53

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As mentioned in the previous section, inhibition of oncogenic signaling involved in
oncogene addiction is a required and sufficient step to induce apoptosis or cell growth arrest
in many types of cancer cells. B-RAF inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma.54 MEK, PI3K and AKT inhibitors are also being tested in clinical
trials to treat multiple cancer types and have the potential to effectively overcome resistance
induced by the activation of RAS/RAF/MEK or PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed, some
preclinical studies have shown that the combination of EGFR and MEK inhibitors reduces
the occurrence of EGFR TKI resistance,43 and that inhibition of the PI3K pathway restores
sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors in PTEN-mutant resistant breast cancer cells and xenograft
tumors.55,56
Compared with the upstream receptors and mediators, the effectors from RTKs signaling
pathway are numerous and diverse. Therefore, it is expected that they may be influenced by
a number of signaling pathways, and the outcome from the cross-talk involving effectors
may be much weaker than the cross-talk at the receptor or mediator level. However, several
lines of evidence have demonstrated that an effector controlled by multiple mediators from
the same RTK signaling or other pathways causes signal redundancy and attenuates drug
sensitivity. For example, inhibition of one mediator can be compensated by another
mediator which can activate the same effector. The role of a single downstream effector in
the resistance to HER family inhibitors is not well demonstrated in the clinic, but the
signaling cross-talk at the effector level may influence the efficacy of the targeted drugs.

Furthermore, the combination of inhibitors targeting receptor/mediator has been shown to
have high toxicity due to side effects, whereas the combination of inhibitors targeting
downstream effectors may limit the toxicity. In the following section, we introduce several
key downstream effectors that have a role in TKI sensitivity (Figure 3).

KEY DOWNSTREAM EFFECTORS OF EGFR/HER2 PATHWAYS THAT ARE
CRITICAL TO TKI SENSITIVITY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As stated above, studies have shown that inhibition of both RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathways is sufficient to inhibit proliferations or to induce apoptosis in various
RTK-addicted cancer cells.22,57 Also, reactivation of either RAS or PI3K by overexpression
of constitutively active mutants renders cells resistant to RTK inhibition.57 Because these
two pathways can rescue the inhibition of another pathway, it is possible that both pathways
regulate multiple common downstream targets. Indeed, there are several common targets
shared between these two signaling pathways that are essential for cell survival and
proliferation. The most-studied common targets are mTOR and its downstream targets. Both
AKT and ERK can activate mTOR by phosphorylating mTORC1 regulators, such as
tuberous sclerosis 2 protein (TSC2).58,59 The main downstream targets of mTOR are S6K1
(p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1) and 4EBP1 (eIF4E binding protein 1).60 S6K1 is
phosphorylated and activated by mTOR to promote translation and growth by
phosphorylating cellular substrates, including ribosomal S6, leading to increased ribosomal
biogenesis. 4EBP1, which inhibits cap-dependent mRNA translation by binding to the
translation initiator eIF4E, is inactivated by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation, resulting in
increased cap-dependent protein translation. Thus, mTOR promotes cell growth by
promoting protein translation and has an essential role in cancer.61 It has been shown that
4EBP1 has a key role in oncogenic AKT and ERK signaling in cancer cells with both
PIK3CA and RAS mutations.62 Moreover, it has recently been shown that the mTOR
pathway can activate the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway through S6K1-mediated Gli1
phosphorylation and that mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, RAD-001) can augment the
anticancer activity of HH pathway inhibitors (GDC-0449, cyclopamine).63

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Effectors, including proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
protein Mcl-1, are known to have essential roles in apoptosis induced by EGFR/HER2
inhibitors.22,64–66 Bim mRNA transcription is mainly controlled by the forkhead O
transcription factor FOXO3a in growth factor-mediated signaling pathway,67 and we and
others have shown that FOXO3a is a common target of AKT and ERK.68,69 Bim itself is
also directly phosphorylated by both AKT and ERK such that AKT-mediated
phosphorylation of Bim attenuates its proapoptotic activitiy, and ERK-mediated
phosphorylation of Bim promotes its ubiquitination and degradation.70,71 Another member
of the Bcl-2 family Mcl-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β, which then undergoes
ubiquitination and degradation.72 Because GSK3β is inactivated by AKT and ERK through
phosphorylation,73,74 both AKT and ERK can inhibit GSK3β-mediated Mcl-1 degradation.
We also showed that ERK increases the stability of Mcl-1 via direct phosphorylation.75 In
addition, AKT and ERK have been shown to upregulate Mcl-1 transcription.76,77 These
findings suggest that the expression and activity of Bim and Mcl-1 are strictly controlled by
MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway and that the apoptosis mechanism regulated by Bim and
Mcl-1 has a critical role in cell death induced by the inhibition of RTK signaling. Indeed,
BH3 mimetic agent ABT-737, which functions in a manner similar to BH3-only proteins
and inhibits Bcl-2, effectively induces apoptosis in EGFR TKI-resistant lung cancer cells.78
In addition to Mcl-1, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL also have a
redundant role in the antiapoptotic mechanism. Therefore, even if Mcl-1 is downregulated
by EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL regulated by other signaling pathways may

contribute to resistance. Both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL transcription are also regulated by nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB),79,80 which has an important role in cell survival in inflammationmediated signaling pathway as we will mention later. Thus, blocking of all three
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may be an alternative strategy to overcome the
resistance. For example, proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bik can block these three
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,81 and we showed that mutant Bik (BikDD), which is
more potent than wild-type Bik, has an equivalent function of cosilencing three antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins.82 BikDD has been used as a therapeutic gene in multiple cancer
types.82–85

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to Bim and Mcl-1, p53, a critical tumor suppressor regulating apoptosis and cell
cycle in response to various stresses is also regulated by a similar mechanism. MDM2 is the
E3 ligase that controls p53 expression via ubiqutination and subsequent proteasomedependent degradation.86 It has been shown that MDM2 can be directly phosphorylated by
AKT and ERK to increase its nuclear localization and activity.87,88 Thus, the tumor
suppressor role of p53 is likely to be negatively affected by HER family RTK inhibitors.
Another unique effector of EGFR/HER2 is STAT3, a transcription factor involved in cell
survival and promotes tumor progression.89,90 STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by Src via
EGFR or HER2 activation to promote cell survival91,92 and is also activated by the IL-6JAK pathway independently of EGFR/HER2. To date, several studies have suggested that
STAT3 activated by JAK is involved in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors.93–96 Moreover,
Src activation has also been implicated in trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer.97
Therefore, the combined inhibition of EGFR/HER2 and STAT3 or JAK/Src may have the
potential to overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Indeed, STAT3 inhibition exhibits
synergistic effects in various cancer cells, when combined with EGFR inhibitors.93,96,98
Aside from these above-mentioned molecules, there are still numerous common effectors
from the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT pathways such as p300, GSK3β and Snail.99–101
These effectors have essential roles in RTK-mediated cancer cell growth, proliferation,
survival and migration/invasion. Their inhibition or activation by signaling pathways other
than RAS/RAF/MEK or PI3K/AKT further strengthens the importance of signaling
crosstalk in the resistance to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. In particular, IκB kinase (IKK)α and
IKKβ have been demonstrated to share multiple common targets with ERK/AKT,102 and
may function as major survival kinases in the inflammation signals including tumor necrosis
factor receptor (TNFR). Thus, we introduce the possible cross-talk of TNFα/IKKα/β with
EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways in the next section.

POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN TKI
RESISTANCE AT VARIOUS LEVELS
In this section, we introduce the roles of the Notch, Wnt/β-catenin and TNFα/IKK/NF-κB
pathways in cancer (Figure 4), and discuss their potential roles in the resistance to EGFR/
HER2 inhibitors via signaling cross-talk at various levels. The Notch signaling pathway is
essential for normal development, but dysregulation of this pathway also contributes to
tumorigenesis.103 The Notch receptor family has four highly homologous members, Notch1,
Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4. Upon the binding of a Delta or Jagged ligand family member,
the Notch receptor is cleaved to release its intracellular domain (Notch intracellular domain),
which can then translocate into the nucleus.104 In the nucleus, Notch intracellular domain
interacts with the coactivator to induce the transcription of downstream target genes.104
Notch has been shown to crosstalk with EGFR/HER2 signaling mainly at the mediator level.
For example, activated Notch1 promotes melanoma cell growth and survival via ERK and
AKT activation.105 Notch target gene HES1 encodes a transcription repressor that can
inhibit DUSP1 and PTEN expression.106,107 DUSP1 is a ubiquitin ligase for ERK, and

inhibition of DUSP1 by HES1 activates ERK.107 Interestingly, EGFR signaling inhibits
Notch1 gene transcription108 whereas HER2 inhibition activates Notch1.109 Therefore, TKI
treatment may activate Notch signaling via a feedback mechanism. Indeed, simultaneous
inhibition of Notch and EGFR was reported to induce synthetic lethality in basal-like breast
cancer cells.110 Furthermore, Notch1 activation is associated with EGFR TKI resistance in
PC9 cells expressing mutated EGFR.111 These studies suggest that Notch and RTK
signaling pathway may cross-talk at the mediator level and contribute to TKI resistance.
Because Notch pathway inhibitors have been tested for cancer treatment, a combination
strategy of EGFR/HER2 inhibitors and Notch pathway inhibitors may be effective to
overcome the Notch-related resistance.112

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The canonical and non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathways function in both embryonic
development and tumorigenesis with the canonical having a more important role in
cancer.113 Wnt ligand binds to Frizzled and LRP5/6 receptor, and initiates a signaling
pathway that inhibits GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent ubiqutination- and
proteasome-dependent degradation of β-catenin.114 Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the
nucleus where it interacts with TCF/LEF to regulate target gene transcription such as myc
and cyclin D.115,116 The Wnt/β-catenin pathway can also cross-talk with the EGFR/HER2
pathway at various levels. Because this pathway has an important role in colon cancer
development, the interplay of the signaling pathways likely exists more commonly in colon
cancer cells. GSK3β, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, can phosphorylate and
induce β-transducing repeat-containing protein-(β-TrCP)-mediated degradation of RAS in
colon cancer cells.117 Interestingly, it has recently been shown that β-catenin alters FOXO3a
function from proapoptotic to metastasis inducer, and confers resistance to PI3K and AKT
inhibitors.118 In colorectal cancer cells, upregulation of MET at both the mRNA and protein
levels by β-catenin contributes to the resistance at the receptor level.119

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Conversely, RTK signaling can also affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in multiple
ways. One approach by which RTK signaling activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is via
GSK3β, which is phoshphorylated by AKT and ERK.73,74 EGFR activation causes the
dissociation of β-catenin from α-catenin and activates it via ERK/CK2α-mediated
phosphorylation of α-catenin.120 Moreover, in response to EGFR signaling, pyruvate kinase
M2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to β-catenin and induces β-catenin target
genes.121 In contrast, B-RAF has been shown to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to
function as proapoptotic regulators when B-RAF is blocked in B-RAF-mutated
melanoma.122 Together, the interplay between the Wnt and TKI signaling pathways at
various levels impacts the cellular response to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. However, as the
cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR/HER2 may be dependent on cell types, it
would be critical to further investigate in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells or HER2-positive
breast cancer cells.
The IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway also has an important role in tumor initiation and
progression in various cancers.123 NF-κB is a transcription factor that is critical for cancer
cell survival. Several cytokines and inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα, interleukin-1 and
lipopolysaccharide can activate this pathway. There are two distinct IKK/NF-κB signaling
pathways: canonical and non-canonical. Among the IKK family members, IKKβ is the
dominant kinase that regulates NF-κB activity in the canonical pathway whereas IKKα is
the dominant kinase in the non-canonical pathway. The detailed mechanisms of IKKmediated NF-κB activation are discussed in several reviews.123–125 Indeed, EGFR TKI
resistance via NF-κB signaling was identified through a non-biased RNA interference screen
in lung cancer cells with mutated EGFR.126 Interestingly, STAT3, which can be activated by
EGFR, also promotes nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB via p300-mediated
acetylation.90

Numerous studies have shown that IKK phosphorylates multiple substrates independently of
NF-κB activity.102 More importantly, these direct IKK substrates include the effectors from
the EGFR/HER2 signaling, resulting in the cross-talk between IKK and RTK
signaling.99,127,128 For example, we previously showed that IKKβ phosphorylates and
inhibits TSC1, resulting in the activation of mTOR pathway.129,130 We also demonstrated
that IKKβ directly phosphorylates FOXO3a and induces β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination
and degradation.131,132 Because both FOXO3a and mTOR are key downstream effectors of
RTK signaling, IKKβ may impact on the RTK signaling through these interplays. Using a
non-biased RNA interference screen, inhibition of IKK was reported to sensitize mutated
EGFR lung cancer cells to TKI-induced apoptosis through NF-κB.126 However, it is not yet
clear whether IKKβ-mediated activation of mTOR/S6K1 pathway or inhibition of FOXO3a
may contribute to the TKI sensitivity.129,131 In addition, IKK has been shown to affect the
Wnt and Notch signaling pathways such that IKKβ is responsible for expression of the
Notch target HES1 in K-RAS-mutant pancreatic cancer transgenic mice model.133 Moreover,
IKKα inhibits FOXA2 by phosphorylating it, resulting in the decrease of NUMB expression
and subsequent NOTCH activation.134 IKKα also phosphorylates β-catenin to inhibit its
subsequent ubiquitination and degradation.135 Together, these findings suggest that the IKK/
NF-κB signaling pathway has an important role in the resistance to RTK inhibitors, although
it may be in a cell type- or context-dependent manner. With all these cross-talk, further
investigation is critical to dissect detailed mechanisms of the cross-talks and will shed light
on the development of effective rational combination therapy.

MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE INDEPENDENT OF SIGNAL CROSS-TALK
About half of TKI resistance mechanisms found in NSCLC patients are caused by the
acquired secondary mutation of EGFR from threonine 790 to methionine (T790M).15 This
type of EGFR mutant cannot be inhibited by first-generation EGFR TKIs, for example,
gefitinib and erlotinib.136 A second generation of irreversible TKIs, such as afatinib and
neratinib, are currently being tested in clinical trials, and the combination of afatinib and
cetuximab has demonstrated effectiveness against EGFR T790M mutant.137 The detailed
mechanisms of secondary mutations are introduced in another review.138 A secondary
mutation is also a common mechanism in the resistances to other TKIs, such as those
targeting Bcr-Abl and ALK.139,140 In addition to secondary mutations, NSCLC- and HER2positive breast cancer cells with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype have been
shown to be resistant to EGFR TKI and trastuzumab, respectively.141,142 Interestingly,
systematic genetic and histological analyses from drug-resistant NSCLC patient revealed
that TKI-sensitive NSCLC could transform into small-cell lung cancer and become resistant
to EGFR TKI.50

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this review, we introduced several mechanisms of the resistance to the inhibitors targeting
the HER receptor family proteins, including some that are well recognized and some that
need to be further validated (Figures 2–4). Moreover, we categorized these cross-talk
mechanisms by their actions at different levels of signal transduction and further discussed
how signaling cross-talk at various levels may attenuate the effects of EGFR/HER2
inhibitors. Some of the pathways have never been shown in connection with the resistance to
EGFR/HER2 inhibitors in the clinic. However, they have the potential to be used as drug
targets in combination with EGFR/HER2 inhibitors.
Although we were not able to cover all of the potential signaling pathways that are
associated with the resistance to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, we believe that other signaling
pathways such as Hedgehog, Hippo, AMPK/LKB and Aurora A/B may also contribute to

the resistance via their cross-talk with the EGFR/HER2 signaling pathway at various levels.
Because the association of each signaling pathway with others at various levels complicates
the cross-talk, more mechanistic studies will be needed to further dissect its impact. In
addition, identification of a key signal node triggering the cross-talk between different
pathways will be an important area to explore. For instance, the signal node may be a
protein complex such that its inhibition could be the key to blocking cancer cell growth and
inducing cancer cell death.
Finally, miRNA has recently been recognized as an important mediator of signal
transduction via regulation of mRNA stability and translation. In fact, some miRNAs have
been suggested to function in EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer.143 It would be of
importance to also explore this emerging area of research to further understand how
miRNAs contribute to signaling cross-talk that leads to drug resistance. As extensive studies
in signal transduction have successfully led to the development of current targeting agents,
we believe that more effective and alternative strategies will soon emerge to overcome
signaling cross-talk-mediated drug resistance.

Signaling cross-talk at the various levels of EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways. EGFR/HER2
signaling pathways cross-talk with other signaling pathways mainly at receptor, mediator
and effector levels. The cross-talk at the receptor level includes other receptor tyrosine
kinases, which have common downstream targets of EGFR/HER2, and affects their
signaling pathway. The cross-talk at mediator level includes the activators of key
downstream signaling, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Multiple
genetic alterations of these pathways affect the downstream effectors of EGFR/HER2 in a
receptor-independent manner. The cross-talk at the effector level includes a variety of key
molecules regulated by EGFR/HER2 signaling. These molecules directly regulate cell
survival and growth, and their post-translational modifications are critical for cancer
initiation, progression and drug sensitivity.

Figure 2.

Currently known resistant mechanisms to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors at receptor and mediator
levels. The signal cross-talk at the receptor level (top) induces the activation of common
downstream pathways of EGFR/HER2, resulting in the drug resistance. This includes
activation of MET, AXL and IGF-1R by gene amplification, overexpression or ligands.
HER2 and EGFR activation also cause resistance to EGFR and HER2 inhibitors,
respectively. HER3 also has a critical role in EGFR/HER2 inhibitors resistance. At the
mediator level (bottom), the components of two major pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR) are activated independently of receptors, resulting in the activation of
downstream effectors. K-RAS, B-RAF and PI3K are frequently activated by mutation
whereas PTEN is inactivated by mutation or deletion in multiple cancer types. Skp2
activates AKT, which is involved in HER2 inhibitor resistance. FAM83A/B activates MEK/
ERK and is involved in EGFR TKI resistance.

Figure 3.

Key effectors for cell survival and growth regulated by both ERK and AKT. TSC and
FOXO3 are tumor suppressors that control cell growth and survival, and the activation of
these molecules are regulated by both ERK and AKT. TSC regulates mTOR activation,
which is critical for cell growth and survival. FOXO3 is a transcription factor that regulates
multiple cell cycle and apoptosis regulators, including Bim. Mcl-1 and Bim are anti- and
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, respectively. Bim is directly phosphorylated by ERK
and undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation. Both AKT and ERK can inhibit GSK3βmediated Mcl-1 degradation. It has been shown that these molecules have an important role
in EGFR/HER2 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis.

Figure 4.

Cross-talk of EGFR/HER2 signaling with other pathways. Wnt/β-catenin, Notch and TNFα/
IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway can cross-talk with the EGFR/HER2 pathway at various
points and affect the sensitivity to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Notch target gene HES1 encodes
a transcription repressor that can inhibit the expression of DUSP1 and PTEN, which are
negative regulators for ERK and AKT, respectively. IKK activated by TNFα has several
common targets with ERK and AKT, including FOXO3, TSC complex. In the Wnt/βcatenin pathway, GSK3β, a negative regulator of this pathway, is phosphorylated and
inactivated by AKT and ERK. GSK3β can phosphorylate and induce β-TrCP-mediated
degradation of RAS.
