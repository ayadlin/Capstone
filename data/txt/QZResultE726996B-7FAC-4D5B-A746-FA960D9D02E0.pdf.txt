Abstract
In mitosis, the kinetochores of chromosomes that lack full
microtubule attachments and/or mechanical tension activate
a signaling pathway called the mitotic spindle checkpoint that
blocks progression into anaphase and prevents premature
segregation of the chromatids until chromosomes become
aligned at the metaphase plate. The spindle checkpoint is
responsible for arresting cells in mitosis in response to
chemotherapeutic spindle poisons such as paclitaxel or
vinblastine. Some cancer cells show a weakened checkpoint
signaling system that may contribute to chromosome instability in tumors. Because complete absence of the spindle
checkpoint leads to catastrophic cell division, we reasoned
that drugs targeting the checkpoint might provide a therapeutic window in which the checkpoint would be eliminated
in cancer cells but sufficiently preserved in normal cells.
We developed an assay to identify lead compounds that inhibit
the spindle checkpoint. Most cells respond to microtubule
drugs by activating the spindle checkpoint and arresting
in mitosis with a rounded morphology. Our assay depended
on the ability of checkpoint inhibitor compounds to drive
mitotic exit and cause cells to flatten onto the substrate in
the continuous presence of microtubule drugs. In this
study, we characterize one of the compounds, OM137, as an
inhibitor of Aurora kinases. We find that this compound is
growth inhibitory to cultured cells when applied at high
concentration and potentiates the growth inhibitory effects
of subnanomolar concentrations of paclitaxel. [Cancer Res

Introduction
During mitosis in metazoans, the duplicated chromosomes,
composed of two identical chromatids joined at the centromere,
move as individuals to align at the metaphase plate. The mitotic
spindle checkpoint is a cell signaling pathway that blocks the
premature onset of chromatid separation until all the kinetochores
of chromosomes are fully occupied by microtubules and/or under

appropriate mechanical tension (reviewed in ref. 1). Spontaneous
or chemically induced defects in the mitotic spindle can lead to
long term activation of the spindle checkpoint, whereupon cells
arrest at the preanaphase stage for many hours.
Many cancers show abnormal chromosome content, often being
hyperdiploid. Certain lines derived from tumors have abnormal
but relatively stable chromosome content, whereas others exhibit
substantial chromosome instability (CIN), a condition in which
chromosomes frequently missegregate. The role of CIN as a
causative factor in oncogenesis is both complex and controversial
(2, 3). However, it is likely that CIN contributes to the production
of variant populations with the potential for increased malignancy
or resistance to therapy. In some instances, tumor lines exhibiting
CIN have been shown to have partially defective spindle checkpoint
signaling, and these checkpoint defects have been shown to reflect
checkpoint gene mutation or altered levels of checkpoint protein
expression (4–6). Whether the partially inactive checkpoint that is
characteristic of many tumor cells renders the cells more or less
sensitive to treatments with microtubule drugs such as paclitaxel
remains controversial (7–10). Whereas tumor cells often exhibit a
partially defective spindle checkpoint, total inactivation of the
checkpoint results in catastrophic cell division that is incompatible
with cell survival (11, 12). We reasoned that differences in the
potency of checkpoint systems in normal versus tumor cells might
provide a therapeutic window for the development of useful drugs
that target the mitotic spindle checkpoint. At appropriate doses,
these drugs could fully eliminate the checkpoint response in tumor
cells, whereas sparing sufficient checkpoint activity for survival
of normal cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs might thus prove
preferentially toxic to tumor cells, particularly when used in
combination with microtubule drugs that cause checkpoint
activation. We devised a cellular assay to test small molecules for
compounds that would override the spindle checkpoint. Here, we
describe the assay used to identify checkpoint inhibitors and
characterize one of those lead compounds, OM137, which
functions to override the spindle checkpoint primarily through
inhibition of the class of mitotic kinases called the Aurora kinases.

Dulbecco’s Modified Minimal Essential Medium with 20 mmol/L Hepes, 10%
FBS, 60 Ag/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Xenopus S3 cells
were grown at 23jC in 70% Leibovitz’s L-15 medium containing 15% FBS,
L-glutamine, 60 Ag/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
High throughput assay for chemical inhibitors of the spindle
checkpoint. HeLa cells in 10 150-mm tissue culture dishes were blocked
for 16 to 17 h with nocodazole at 100 ng/mL. The rounded mitotic cells
were released from the substratum by gentle agitation and collected. Assays
were conducted in duplicate in 384-well plates. A commercial library of
10,000 diverse small molecules (Chembridge Corp.) was stored at 20jC in
96-well plates at an approximate concentration of 2.5 mmol/L in DMSO.
Ten microliters of medium were distributed to each well of the 384-well
plates. A 0.5-AL 96 pin transfer device (V.P Scientific) was used to transfer
an initial aliquot of the test compounds to the top left well (well A) of a
4-well quadrant in the 384-well plate. A 2-AL 96 pin transfer device was used
to make serial dilutions to the other 3 wells (wells B, C, D) of the quadrant.
An additional 10 AL of medium containing f104 cells was added to each
well. Assuming a uniform molecular weight of 500 for the compounds, each
test compound is tested at concentrations of 55, 10, 1.7, and 0.3 Amol/L in
the 4 wells of the quadrant. The nocodazole concentration was maintained
at 20 ng/mL. Negative controls were included in each plate including wells
with only medium or cells tested with carrier (DMSO). As a positive control,
RO-31-8220 at 10 Amol/L was added. RO-31-8220 is an inhibitor of cyclindependent kinase 1 (13) and elicits mitotic exit and flattening onto the
substrate for cells in nocodazole.
For the remainder of the protocol, one of the duplicate plates was rotated
180 degrees to counteract processing artifacts such as inhomogeneities in
certain channels of the washer or fluorescent plate reader. Plates were
incubated for 4 h at 37jC to allow mitotic exit and attachment of cells in
wells where the spindle checkpoint was abrogated. Plates were then washed
with 5 cycles in a Tecan PW-384 plate washer using MOPS/Triton/DNase
[0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.8 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.8 mmol/L MgCl2,
10 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.3), and 10 Ag/mL DNase 1 (Sigma)]. The DNase
serves to reduce nonspecific background due to cells becoming trapped in
DNA gel released by dead or dying cells. After the final wash, wells were
treated with a fixation/permeablilzation/staining solution consisting of 2%
paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100, 60 mmol/L Pipes, 25 mmol/L HEPES,
10 mmol/L EGTA, 4 mmol/L MgSO4 (pH 6.9), and the fluorescent DNA label
Syber Gold used at the manufacturer’s recommended concentration diluted
1:10,000 from the stock (Invitrogen). The plates were then read with a Tecan
Genios fluorescent plate reader.
Immunofluorescence. Xenopus S3 cells were grown on glass coverslips
and incubated in 25 Amol/L MG132 for 90 min to accumulate cells arrested
at metaphase. Cells were then incubated in media containing 25 Amol/L
MG132 and OM137 ranging from 0.8 to 100 Amol/L for 60 min. Cells were
treated with fixation-extraction solution [0.5%Triton X-100, 1.5% paraformaldehyde, 60 mmol/L Pipes, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L EGTA,
4 mmol/L MgSO4, 400 nmol/L Microcystin-LR (pH 6.9)] for 15 min at room
temperature. Mouse anti–phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling; 1/2,000) and
Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1/1,000) antibodies were used to detect phosphorylated histone H3. DNA was stained
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Labeled cells were mounted
in Vectashield (Vector Industries) containing 10 mmol/L MgSO4. Threedimensional images were collected using a Ziess Axioplan IIe microscope,
100 objective (Plan-APOCHROMAT, 1.4 NA) and a Hammamatsu C4747298 CCD camera. Fluorescence images were analyzed using Metamorph
software (Molecular Devices).
Chromosome isolation and immunofluorescence. HeLa cells were
treated with 330 nmol/L nocodazole for 4 h to accumulate mitotic cells.
Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off and their media was exchanged to
330 nmol/L nocodazole and 25 mmol/L MG132. OM137 was added to
experimental cultures for a final concentration of 100 Amol/L, whereas
control cultures received an equivalent volume of DMSO. Mitotic cells were
washed in 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L EGTA,
4 mmol/L MgSO4, and 400 nmol/L Microcystin-LR by centrifugation at
200  g for 4 min. Mitotics were lysed in 60 mmol/L Pipes, 25 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 6.9), 10 mmol/L EGTA, 4 mmol/L MgSO4 (PHEM), 0.5% Triton

X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, 400 nmol/L Microcystin-LR, and 5 Ag/mL protease
inhibitor cocktail. The extracts were centrifuged through a cushion of lysis
buffer containing 10% glycerol over poly-L-lysine–treated glass coverslips at
1,500  g for 10 min at 4jC to collect chromosomes for immunofluorescence
labeling. The chromosome-coated coverslips were then fixed in PHEM and
1.5% formaldehyde for 15 min and processed for immunofluorescence
analysis as described previously (14). Mouse anti-Aurora B (BD Biosciences),
Rabbit anti-MAD2 (generously provided by Dr. Rey Chen, Academia Sinica,
Taiwan), and Rabbit anti-BUBR1 (generously provided by Dr. Todd
Stukenberg, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) were used at 1.25,
0.5 Ag/mL, and 1:100, respectively. Chromosome fluorescence image capture
and analysis was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope equipped
with a 100  (NA 1.4) objective, a Hamamatsu Orca 2 camera (Hamamatsu
Photonics), and Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices).
Kinase assays. All kinase assays were carried out in 30 AL. Reaction
mixes contained 50 Amol/L ATP, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 5 ACi
[g-32P]-ATP, 1 Ag of the appropriate substrate (see below), 1 AL DMSO or
drugs dissolved in DMSO, and 50 to 100 ng kinase. Reaction mixes were
incubated for 1 h at 30jC, quenched with SDS loading buffer and resolved
on 14% SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography.
Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software (W. Rasband,
NIH). IC50 values were calculated from log-dose response curves using
Prism 4 software (Graph Pad). Aurora A:TPX2, Aurora B:INCENP and
CDK5:p25 purification protocols and kinase assay conditions have been
described previously (15–17). Plk1 and CDK1:Cyclin B were kind gifts of
Dr. Aldo Tarricone (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). Bub1:Bub3
complex and Mps1 kinase were expressed in, and purified from, Sf9 insect
cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. The complex was isolated
on Ni-NTA beads and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography.
Bub1:Bub3 kinase reaction buffer contained 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and histone H3
was used as substrate. Human Mps1 was expressed and purified in Sf9
cells. Mps1 was assayed in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
10 mmol/L MnCl2, and Mad1:Mad2 complex as a substrate (18). Human
Nek2A (residues 1–291) was expressed in Escerichia coli as a fusion to
glutathione S-transferase (GST). The protein was purified on reduced
glutathione (GSH) Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and the GST tag
cleaved using PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). The cleaved product
was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Nek2A assays
were carried out in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and
10 mmol/L MnCl2 with a-casein as a substrate. Human Plk1 (a kind
gift from Nerviano Medical Sciences) was tested in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA with acasein as a substrate. Human Tao1 (residues 1–356) cDNA was a kind gift of
Dario Alessi (University of Dundee, Dundee, UK). Tao1 was expressed as
an NH2-terminal GST fusion in Escherichia coli and isolated on GSH
Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). GST-tagged TAO1 immobilized on
GSH Sepharose beads was direclty used in kinase assay in 40 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA and myelin basic
protein as a substrate. CDK1:cyclin B was assayed under the same
conditions previously described for CDK5:p25 (15–17).
Video microscopy. S3, Ptk1, or HeLa cells were grown on 25-mm round
coverslips. The coverslips were sealed into Sykes Moore Chambers (Bellco),
and medium containing test compounds were added using a syringe. Cells
were cultured at 37jC on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope or
a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope. Images were collected at intervals
using phase contrast or Nomarski differential interference contrast
microscopy (DIC) optics with Roper Coolsnap-HQ2 or Hamamtsu OrcaERG cameras using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) or NISElements software (Nikon).
Cell proliferation assay. HeLa cells at 80 cells per well were seeded in
96-well plates and permitted to adhere to the substratum for 6 h while
incubating at 37jC under 5% CO2. Test compounds were then added;
paclitaxel at 0.25 nmol/L and OM137 ranging from 6.25 to 100 Amol/L.
Controls received equivalent levels of DMSO (the diluent for both
compounds). All conditions were assayed in quadruplicate. Cells were
incubated for 4 d under these conditions. At the end of the 4th day, the

medium was exchanged with fresh media containing OM137 at the same
concentrations, but paclitaxel was increased to 0.75 nmol/L. Cells were
incubated for an additional 4 d. The amount of cell proliferation was
measured using the CellTiter 96AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay (Promega Corporation; G3580). Absorbance measurements were
obtained using a Tecan Genios plate reader. Data from cells treated solely
with OM137 were normalized to untreated cell values. Values obtained
from cells exposed to Taxol and OM137 were normalized to data from cells
treated with Taxol alone.

Results
High throughput screening identifies chemical inhibitors of
the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Many cultured cells that are wellattached during interphase become rounded during mitosis and
maintain only weak attachment to the substratum. Upon division
and exit from mitosis, they reattach and reflatten (Fig. 1A). Cells
treated with microtubule drugs such as nocodozole arrest in
mitosis through the action of the spindle checkpoint and remain
arrested in this rounded state for several hours. They can be
dislodged easily with gentle agitation of the medium. However, if
the spindle checkpoint is inactivated, these cells will flatten and
reattach without division (Fig. 1A). We transferred nocodazolearrested mitotic cells to wells of 384-well dishes and tested a library
of small molecules for their ability to induce mitotic exit in the
arrested cells. Compounds that inactivate the checkpoint caused
cells to exit mitosis, flatten, and reattach firmly to the substratum.

The cells in wells containing inactive compounds remained
rounded and were easily washed from the dishes (Fig. 1B). After
fixation in a solution containing a fluorescent DNA label, we used a
fluorescence plate reader to rapidly assess which test compounds
could induce mitotic exit and cell reattachment. Because the assay
requires cells to actively flatten onto the substrate it selects against
compounds that are merely cytotoxic.
The screen was also designed to eliminate a number of false
positives. Because a fluorescent DNA label was used it was simple
matter to examine microscopically, all the wells scored as positive
from the plate reader analysis and confirm that they contained live
cells that had been induced to exit mitosis (Fig. 1C). In wells where
cells exited mitosis, the chromatin was decondensed and
assembled into one or more rounded nuclei within the attached
cells. In a few instances however, we noted that positive wells
contained a high proportion of attached cells in which chromatin
remained condensed in mitotic chromosomes. These false positives
were excluded from further analysis.
The spindle checkpoint functions by inhibiting the ubiquitylation pathway that targets cyclin B and other proteins for
degradation by the proteasome. Thus, proteasome activity is
downstream of the checkpoint and is absolutely required for
mitotic exit induced by chemical inhibitors of the spindle
checkpoint. As a secondary screen potential spindle checkpoint
inhibitors were tested for the ability to override a mitotic block
imposed by a combination of nocodazole and the proteasome

Figure 1. A high throughput, whole cell assay for small molecule inhibitors of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. A, in normal cell division cells become rounded during
mitosis and flatten onto the substrate after cytokinesis. In response to microtubule drugs, the spindle checkpoint is activated and cells remain arrested as rounded cells,
whereas the checkpoint is active. If the checkpoint fails, cells flatten and reattach often in the absence of cytokinesis. B, schematic for checkpoint inhibitor assay.
Cells forced to exit mitosis will flatten and reattach to the substratum. Mitotic cells remain rounded and are washed from the assay plates. C, DNA labeling of cells in
assay plates allows immediate visualization of wells in which cells exit M phase with decondensed chromosomes and reformed nuclei that are often abnormal in
shape (arrowheads, left ). In contrast, drugs that induce cells to remain stuck to plates in the absence of mitotic exit show condensed chromosomes (arrows, right ).
These are scored as false positives. Bar, 10 Am. D, Secondary screening with proteasome inhibitor–treated cells distinguishes drugs that inhibit the spindle checkpoint
from those that induce mitotic exit through other mechanisms such as inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. Checkpoint inhibitors induce exit from nocodazole

DMSO (control ) or 100 Amol/L OM137 and then the mitotic cells were washed off and used to prepare isolated chromosomes. The kinetochores of the isolated
chromosomes were labeled with the antibodies for Aurora B, Mad2, or BubR1. Bar, 1 Am. D, quantification of antibody labeling of kinetochores from chromosomes

inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1D). Thus, those compounds that induced
mitotic exit of nocodazole-treated cells in the absence of MG132
but failed to induce mitotic exit in its presence were scored as
positive inhibitors of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. As controls
for this assay, we used chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent
kinase 1, which are able to induce mitotic exit in the presence of
proteasome inhibitors (13).
We screened a commercial library of 10,000 small molecules
(Chembridge Corp.) From these, we identified 11 compounds of
distinct structure that inhibited the spindle checkpoint at
micromolar concentrations. Most often hits scored at the highest
concentration tested. Here, we report in detail the characterization
of the cell biological effects and the molecular targets of one
compound, OM137, which scored as a hit at the highest
concentration tested in the initial screen. Characterization of other
lead compounds and identification of cellular targets for other
compounds identified in the screen is under way and will be
reported subsequently.
Compound OM137 is an inhibitor of Aurora kinases. To
obtain clues to the potential molecular targets of lead compounds,
we assayed their effects on phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone
H3 using an antibody that specifically binds this site when
phosphorylated. Serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3 is
catalyzed by Aurora B kinase, which becomes activated in mitosis.
We and others have shown that Aurora B activity is required for

maintenance of the spindle checkpoint (19–21). To ensure that loss
of phosphorylation of histone H3 was a direct consequence of
inhibition of Aurora B and not an indirect effect of mitotic exit, we
carried out the assay using cells cultured in the presence of the
proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Certain lead compounds, particularly F and K, showed partial inhibition of Aurora kinase activity,
reflected by reduced expression of the serine 10 phosphoepitope on
histone H3. However, as shown in Fig. 2A and B, OM137 showed
the most potent inhibition among the lead compounds. Accordingly, we found that OM137 treatment of cells led to significant
reduction in the concentrations of spindle checkpoint-signaling
proteins, Mad2 and BubR1, at the kinetochores of chromosomes
(Fig. 2C and D). When tested at a range of concentrations for
inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation in mitotic cells, OM137
showed an IC50 of f15 Amol/L (Fig. 3A and B).
We tested OM137 for direct inhibition of Aurora A and Aurora B
kinase as well as with a variety of other mitotic kinases. We found
that OM137 inhibited Aurora A kinase (IC50, 21.7 Amol/L) and
Aurora B kinase (IC50, 2.4 Amol/L; Fig. 4A). When tested with other
mitotic kinases Mps1, Bub1, Plk1, Nek2A, and Tao1 that have been
implicated in spindle checkpoint signaling, OM137 showed no
significant inhibition (Fig. 4B). We did observe that OM137 showed
in vitro activity in inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk1/
cyclinB and Cdk5/p25 with an approximate IC50 of 20 Amol/L.

Analogues of OM137. A number of compounds with alternative
substitutions on the aryl ring were available commercially. We tested
several in our checkpoint assay. As shown in Fig. 5, we found several
analogues with activities in the spindle checkpoint assay similar to
(compounds 3 and 4) or even stronger than (compound 2) OM137
and we noted certain substitutions (compounds 5–8) led to loss of
activity. These structure-activity relationship data highlight the
importance of the amino group on the thiazole moiety and the
presence and position of the hydroxyl group on the aryl moiety as
important determinants for checkpoint inhibition.
Compound OM137 induces mitotic exit in cells arrested by
the spindle checkpoint. With video microscopy, we studied
cellular responses to abrogation of the spindle checkpoint by
OM137 using cells that remain relatively flat in mitosis. In cultured
Xenopus S3 cells treated with OM137 before nuclear envelope
breakdown, many chromosomes failed to align at the metaphase
plate. Cells then entered anaphase with massive chromosome
missegregation; cytokinesis failed, and mitotic exit resulted in the
formation of a misshapen and multilobed nucleus (Supplementary
Video S1; Fig. 6A). Similarly, when cells were treated with OM137
in the early stages of prometaphase after nuclear envelope
breakdown, premature mitotic exit mitotic exit occurred accompanied by chromosome decondensation and reformation of a
misshapen interphase nucleus. OM137 treatment of mitotic cells

also caused restructuring of the microtubule network from the
mitotic spindle array to the interphase pattern (Supplementary
Video S2; Fig. 6B). As expected, OM137 also overrode chronic
checkpoint activation induced by treatment of cells with
microtubule poisons. Ptk1 cells treated with nocodazole remained
arrested with condensed mitotic chromosomes for several hours
(Supplementary Video S3; Fig. 6C, left column). In contrast when
nocodazole-arrested cells were cotreated with OM137, the chromosomes rapidly decondensed and an interphase nucleus
reformed around the undivided chromosomes (Supplementary
Video S4; Fig. 6C, right column).
Compound OM137 inhibits cell growth and enhances
growth inhibitory effects of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a commonly
used antitumor drug. We tested whether OM137 would inhibit HeLa
cell growth when used alone or in combination with paclitaxel.
At higher concentrations, OM137 showed growth inhibition, and
inhibition was significantly increased when OM137 was applied
with subnanomolar concentrations of paclitaxel (Fig. 6D, right).
Subnanomolar concentrations of paclitaxel showed only minimal
growth inhibition when used alone (Fig. 6D, left).

Discussion
Human tumors have also been reported to show altered spindle
checkpoint signaling characteristics that, in some instances, are due
to mutations or altered levels of checkpoint signaling proteins.

Aurora kinases are often misregulated in human tumors (reviewed
in refs. 22, 23). These changes may lead to alterations in events of
mitosis, e.g., malfunctions in spindle assembly and chromosome
segregation. Aurora B is required for normal function of the mitotic
spindle checkpoint (19–21). Mitotic defects may contribute to
chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in human cancers and
these chromosomal abnormalities may contribute to tumor malignancy (reviewed in refs. 2, 10). However, altered checkpoint activity
due to improper expression of Aurora kinases in tumor cells may
also present a target for tumor-specific anticancer therapeutics. A
number of other Aurora kinase inhibitors have been reported and
several of these are currently in clinical trial (reviewed in ref. 23).
Here, we show that a screen to detect compounds that inhibit
the spindle checkpoint identified an inhibitor of Aurora kinases
termed OM137. OM137 is an aminothiazole derivative. Thiazole
derivatives have previously been identified as Aurora kinase
inhibitors (24). Recently a large scale screen was carried out
assaying compounds for inhibition of Aurora A kinase in vitro that
identified and characterized a large number of small molecule
aminothiazole compounds related to but distinct from OM137 (25).
Although many of the compounds analyzed in that study were
more potent inhibitors of Aurora A kinase in vitro, the authors
reported that obtaining responses consistent with Aurora kinase
inhibition in living cells required concentrations 10 to 100 fold
higher than that required in vitro, attributing the difference in
potency to problems with cell permeability of the compounds.

Inhibitors of the Mitotic Spindle Checkpoint

Figure 6. OM137 inhibits chromosome alignment at metaphase, induces premature anaphase, overrides the mitotic spindle checkpoint, and promotes the growth
inhibitory activity of paclitaxel. A, a Xenopus S3 cell was treated before nuclear envelope breakdown with OM137 at 100 Amol/L and then imaged by time lapse
phase contrast microscopy. A minority of the chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate (single arrow ) and these underwent chromatid separation when the cell
entered premature anaphase (double arrow ). As the cell exits M phase, the chromosomes decondensed and a large multilobed nucleus formed. The time-lapse
sequence for this cell is shown in Supplementary Video S1. B, a Xenopus S3 cell stably expressing GFP-tubulin was treated with OM137 at 50 Amol/L and imaged by
phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Shortly after treatment at time 0, chromosomes (arrows ) begin to decondense eventually forming an abnormally shaped
interphase nucleus by 30 min. In the GFP-tubulin image, the cell at time 0 has bright mitotic spindle poles (arrowheads ) and a nascent mitotic spindle. Treatment
with OM137 leads to loss of the spindle structure and reversion to the interphase microtubule array. The time-lapse sequence for this cell is shown in Supplementary
Video S2. C, cultures of flat epithelial Ptk1 cells were treated with 100 ng nocodazole for 20 min before DIC imaging. Control cultures that did not receive OM137
(left column ) remain arrested in mitosis. At time 0, one cell is already arrested at prometaphase (bottom arrow ), whereas another cell is in prophase (top arrow ). A few
minutes later, both cells are arrested at prometaphase and remain arrested for the duration of imaging (165 min). As they remain in mitosis, cells tend to become more
rounded. The time-lapse sequence for this sequence is shown in Supplementary Video S3. In experimental cultures that were treated with nocodazole plus 80 Amol/L
OM137 (bottom row ) cells escape spindle checkpoint arrest. The arrow points to a prometaphase cell. By 20 min, the chromosomes have begun to decondense.
Decondensation and nuclear envelope reformation take place over the ensuing time such that by 70 min, a characteristic interphase nucleus has reformed showing that
the cell has exited M phase without chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The time-lapse sequence for this cell is shown in Supplementary Video S4. Bars, 10 Am.
D, subnanomolar concentrations of paclitaxel caused only minor inhibition of HeLa cell growth over 8 d (left ). OM137 at higher concentrations inhibited cell growth.
When used in combination with subnanomolar concentrations of paclitaxel, growth inhibition was enhanced (right ).

Our screen for checkpoint inhibitor activity was conducted with
whole cells and therefore required that effective compounds be cell
permeable. In addition, we found that OM137 was a more potent
inhibitor of Aurora B compared with Aurora A in vitro, consistent
with the effects of OM137 on checkpoint function in living cells.
We also found that OM137 showed inhibitory activity against cyclindependent kinases. Cdk1 inhibitors can drive mitotic exit when
applied to cells in culture (13, 26). However, unlike other Cdk1
inhibitors, OM137 was unable to drive mitotic exit when the
proteasome was inhibited. Thus, it is likely that the major mode by
which OM137 drives mitotic exit of cells arrested in M phase via the

spindle checkpoint is through its inhibitory activity against Aurora
B kinase. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase is known to induce override
of the spindle checkpoint (19–21). We hypothesize that OM137
induces catastrophic mitotic exit in cultured cells through its
activity on Aurora kinases. This effect may be assisted by other
properties of OM137 including its ability to inhibit cyclin-dependent
kinases. Compounds that inhibit the spindle checkpoint may
provide a novel approach toward directly targeting tumors that
show partially defective checkpoints. Such compounds may also
enhance the antitumor potency of M phase checkpoint activators
such as paclitaxel and other microtubule poisons.
