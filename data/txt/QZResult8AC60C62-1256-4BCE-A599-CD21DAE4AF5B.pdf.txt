Abstract
Recent studies indicate that ovarian cancer may be highly responsive to antivascular therapeutics. We have
developed an antivascular tumor therapeutic using the F3 peptide to target cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles
(F3-Cis-Np) to tumor vessels. We show that although F3-Cis-Np bind with high specificity to both human
ovarian tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells in vitro, they only show cytotoxic activity against the tumor
endothelial cells. In vivo these nanoparticles bind primarily to tumor endothelial cells. Therapeutic studies in
both flank and orthotopic i.p. murine ovarian tumor models, as well as human tumor xenograft models, show
rapid tumor regression with treatment. Treatment was associated with significant vascular necrosis consistent
with an antivascular effect. Furthermore, treatment was active in both platinum-sensitive and platinumresistant cell lines. Importantly, we show that F3-Cis-Np bind to human tumor endothelial cells in vitro
and to human tumor vessels in vivo. Therapy targeting human vasculature in vivo with F3-Cis-Np led to
near complete loss of all human tumor vessels in a murine model of human tumor vasculature. Our studies
indicate that F3-targeted vascular therapeutics may be an effective treatment modality in human ovarian cancer.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is a deadly disease for which there have
been few new therapies. For a decade platinum and taxane
chemotherapy regimens have remained the mainstay of therapy. Recent studies have suggested that angiogenic pathways
are important therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer. Phase II
trials suggest a significant response rate of ovarian cancer
to anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy
(1–4). This is unlike other solid tumors such as colon, lung,
and breast cancer which showed no response to single agent
anti-VEGF therapy. When anti-VEGF therapy is used in combination with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer, response
rates are even higher (5, 6). Unfortunately, even when antiVEGF therapy is used in combination with chemotherapy,
response to the former is relatively short. This is due in part
to host cell upregulation of alternate angiogenic pathways (7).
Targeting vascular cells directly represents a means to
target numerous angiogenic pathways that act ultimately at
the endothelial cell. In addition, unlike traditional antiangioAuthors' Affiliations: 1Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of

genic therapies that prevent new vasculature, and therefore
typically lead to disease stabilization but not regression,
targeting active tumor vascular cells could potentially lead
to tumor necrosis and disease regression. Ovarian tumor
vasculature has been shown to be unique from normal resting vasculature (8, 9). Several peptides have been identified
and developed which bind with relatively high affinity and
specificity to tumor vessels. RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid) motif–containing peptides have been developed which
bind to integrin molecules that are upregulated on tumor vessels and sometimes tumor cells (10, 11). Similarly, aspargineglycine-arginine peptides can be used to target CD13 isoforms
expressed in tumor vasculature (12). The 31-amino-acid F3
peptide has also been shown to bind to nucleolin protein
expressed on the surface of tumor endothelial cells as well
as on the surface tumor cells (13–15).
These peptides have been used to target nanoparticles
carrying various therapeutic payloads to the tumor, such as
magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and photodynamic drugs (16, 17). This approach allows the therapeutic
agent to be concentrated at the tumor site, while reducing
systemic exposure and potentially reducing drug-related side
effects. RGD-targeted cisplatin nanoparticles were found
to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro (18). RGDtargeted paclitaxel containing nanoparticles were shown to
target ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and effectively
restrict ovarian tumor growth (19). Similarly, in several
tumor models including ovarian cancer, vascular-targeted
liposomal doxorubicin was found to be a more effective therapeutic than traditional doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin

F3-Cisplatin-Nanoparticle Therapy

(20). Interestingly, a targeting peptide (iRGD) has been developed that combines the RGD motif with a protease site and a
neuropilin targeting motif to create a peptide that promotes
transendothelial passage of nanoparticles to enhance tissue
penetration and targeting to tumor cells (21). The F3 peptide
has also been used to deliver nanoparticles to the tumor
microenvironment. A rat model of glioblastoma multiforme
suggested that F3-targeted nanoparticles can be used for both
tumor imaging and therapy (14).
Studies to date have all focused on in vitro studies or studies in rodents. One shortcoming of these studies is the lack
of a demonstration of activity against human tumor vessels
in vivo. A model of human tumor vasculature has recently
been developed (22, 23). This model uses human embryonic
stem cells as a source of vascular cells; thus, the vascular cells
are human. Vessels generated in this model are shown to have
both human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.
We used the F3 peptide to deliver cisplatin-loaded polyacrylamide (PAA) nanoparticles to tumor vessels in both
murine and human ovarian cancer models. We show that
these nanoparticles bind to murine and human tumor endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. When used as a therapeutic, these nanoparticles lead to significant tumor regression
and then stabilization of tumor burden. Nanoparticles were
effective in both xenograft and orthotopic tumor models.
Our data strongly support the efficacy of vascular-targeted
nanoparticle therapy in ovarian cancer and represent the first
time chemo-nanoparticle binding to human tumor vessels
in vivo has been shown.

Materials and Methods
Nanoparticle preparation
Chemicals. Acrylamide, TEMED, ammonium persulfate (APS),
polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Brij 30), 3-(acryloyloxy)-2hydroxypropylmethacrylamide (AHM), hexane, and dioctyl
sulfosuccinate (AOT) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
3-(aminopropyl) methacrylamide (APMA) was obtained from
Polysciences Inc., and ethanol (190 proof) was obtained from
Fisher Scientific. Cisplatin was purchased from SICOR pharmaceuticals Inc., whereas sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]
cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC), Traut's reagent (2-IT),
amine reactive FITC, and AlexaFluor 594 were from Thermo
Scientific Inc. All solutions were prepared from 18 mol/LΩ water
purified by a Barnstead/Thermolyne Nanopure II system except
where otherwise stated.
Blank nanoparticle polymerization. Hexane (45 mL) was
added into a dried flask and stirred under a constant purge
of argon. AOT (1.6 g) and Brij 30 (3.1 g) were added with
continuous mixing under argon for 20 minutes. Acrylamide
(0.711 g) and APMA (0.055 g) were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4)
by sonication. AHM (0.428 g) was added to the acrylamide
solution and the mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes to
obtain uniformity. The acrylamide solution was then added
to the hexane mixture and vigorously stirred for 20 minutes
under argon protection. Polymerization reaction was initiated
with fresh ammonium persulfate (10% aqueous solution,

www.aacrjournals.org

40 μL) and TEMED (40 μL), and vigorous mixing was continued
for 12 hours. Hexane was then removed by rotary evaporation
and nanoparticles were precipitated with ethanol. Surfactant
and unreacted monomers were removed by washing with ethanol (5 × 160 mL) followed by washing with water (5 × 100 mL)
in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (200 mL, equipped with a Biomax 100 kDa cutoff membrane). The concentrated nanoparticles were lyophilized for two days before use.
Cisplatin-encapsulated and FITC- or AlexaFluor-linked
nanoparticles. Cisplatin-encapsulated nanoparticles were
polymerized as above except that 2 mL cisplatin (SICOR
Pharmaceuticals Inc., obtained via the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Michigan) drug solution (1 mg/mL)
was used to dissolve all the monomers and nanoparticles
were protected from light during the production process. An
inductively coupled plasma (Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000 DV
with Winlab software) was used to determine the concentration of cisplatin encapsulated. The cisplatin concentration
was measured to be 0.75 ± 0.02 μg/mg nanoparticle, and
nanoparticle solution was prepared to allow consistent dosing
of cisplatin among experiments.
For fluorophore-linked nanoparticles, 1 mg of FITC or
5 mg of AlexaFluor 594 were added into monomer solution
and the mixture was kept stirring at 37°C for an hour before
injection into hexane. Blank, fluorophore-conjugated, or
cisplatin-encapsulated PAA nanoparticles were prepared with
a final average size of 24.4 nm (polydispersity index = 0.120).
F3-targeted nanoparticles. Cisplatin-encapsulated, fluorophore-linked, or blank nanoparticles were suspended in
PBS by sonication, sulfo-SMCC was added, solution was
mixed for 60 minutes, and then SMCC-conjugated nanoparticles were washed three times using Amicon centrifugal
filter unit. F3 peptide and 2-IT dissolved in distilled water
was then added into the SMCC-conjugated nanoparticle
suspension. The mixture was mixed overnight and then
washed again to obtain the concentrated nanoparticles.
Cell lines and in vitro studies. ID8 and A2008 cells were
a generous gift from Dr. George Coukos (Abramson Cancer
Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). SKOV3,
HEY1, and A2780 cell lines were a generous gift of Dr. Rebecca
Liu (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Tumor endothelial cell (TEC) cultures were freshly generated from VECadherin+/CD146+ cells fluorescence associated cell sorting
isolated from mechanically dissected tumors as previously
described (24, 25). TEC were then grown in EBM2 media
(Clonetech). Monocytes were isolated from 2 mL of ACK lysed
donor blood based upon their ability to adhere to plastic. All
cells except TEC were grown in RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum/
5% penicillin-streptomycin medium and split two days prior
to experiments to 40% confluency. For binding experiments,
cells were incubated with a range of F3-targeted AlexaFluor
594–linked nanoparticles (F3-Alex-Np), or blank nanoparticles
(10–100 μg/mL) for 4 hours with intermittent rocking. Cells
were then washed three times with PBS, incubated for
30 minutes, and then imaged using a Nikon fluorescent microscope attached to CoolSNAP CCD camera (Roper Scientific).
To determine in vitro killing efficiency, cells were incubated
with F3-targeted blank nanoparticles (F3-Np), F3-targeted

cisplatin-encapsulated nanoparticles (F3-Cis-Np; 0.15 μg/mL
final cisplatin concentration), parental cisplatin compound
[at 5 μg/mL final concentration for cell line experiments
and at 1 μg/mL for TEC and peripheral blood mononuclear
cell (PBMC) experiment), or mock treated with PBS. The cells
were washed after 4 hours and then allowed to grow for a
total of 72 hours prior to harvesting for cell counting via
trypan blue exclusion.
Mouse studies. All mice were housed at the University of
Michigan Medical School in the Unit for Laboratory Medicine
and protocols were approved under the University Committee
on the Use and Care of Animals. Tumor cell lines were
grown in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum/5% penicillinstreptomycin medium.
Axillary and flank tumor models. Cells (10 × 106) were
injected with 0.2 mL of PBS and 300 μL of matrigel (BD Biosciences). In the initial targeting experiments, axillary tumors
were allowed to grow for 10 days and then 100 mg/Kg F3targeted Alexa 488–linked nanoparticles (F3-FITC-Np) or
Alexa 488–linked nanoparticles (FITC-Np) were administered
i.v. Twenty-four hours after injection the mice were sacrificed,
and tumors, liver, lung, kidney, heart, and spleen were harvested and examined for fluorescent nanoparticle uptake.
For therapeutic studies Hey1 tumor cells were stably transduced with a DsRed-expressing lentivirus (plentiloxEV-DsRed
virus, provided by the vector core at the University of Michigan).
Tumor cells were injected s.c. into either the flank (ID8 studies)
or axilla (SKOV3, A2780-GFP, and DsRED HEY1) of either
C57Bl6 or nu/nu mice, respectively. Axillary injection was used
in the case of the human tumor xenografts as we find axillary
tumors have a greater microvascular density than flank tumors.
Xenografts were allowed to establish as indicated and were
treated with either (a) i.p. cisplatin at 250 μg/kg alone or
(b) i.p. cisplatin combined with F3-Np via tail vein injection
or (c) with F3-Cis-Np via tail vein injection (i.v.) at 100 mg/kg
of nanoparticles (final cisplatin concentration 75 μg/kg). Mice
were treated initially at day 10 and day 14 (all tumor xenografts) and day 21 (for ID8 and SKOV3 xenografts only). Tumor
volume was monitored via caliper (W2 × L/2). A2780-GFP mice
were imaged with whole-body imaging utilizing the Maestro
imaging system. Mice were sacrificed on either day 18 or day
28. Axillary and flank tumors were harvested for histology and
immunohistochemistry.
Intraperitoneal models. Mice were randomized by weight
into treatment groups. ID8 cells (2.0 × 10 6) harvested in
exponential growth were injected i.p. in 0.2 mL of PBS. Ten
days after tumor cell injection, control mice were treated
with either i.p. cisplatin at 250 μg/kg alone or along with
(a) i.p. blank F3-Np, (b) i.v. blank F3-Np, or (c) both i.p.
and i.v. administered blank F3-Np. Alternatively, mice were
treated with F3-Cis-NP (a) delivered i.v., (b) i.p., or (c) both
i.v. and i.p. Nanoparticles were dosed with final cisplatin dose
of 150 μg/kg: 150 μg/kg for i.v. or i.p. alone, or 75 μg/kg
i.v. and 75 μg/kg i.p. for i.v./i.p. treated animals. Mice were
treated at days 10, 14, 21, and 28. Mice were followed for
weight gain/ascites and sacrificed after a 10-g weight gain or
when they appeared moribund. Kaplan-Meier curves were
plotted and statistical analysis was performed via log rank test.

Teratoma model. Hey-1/teratomas were generated as previously described (22, 23). Briefly, H9 embryonic stem cells
(ESC) were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts, manually dispersed, and passaged. Undifferentiated H9 embryonic
stem cells (1 × 106) were injected s.c. into the axilla of nonobese
diabetic–severe combined immunodeficient mice with matrigel and allowed to grow until teratomas were palpable. DsRedHEY1 cells numbering 100,000 were then injected within
teratoma. Tumors were imaged using bio-immunofluorescence.
Given the large size of the tumor/teratomas and their rapid
growth rates, mice were then treated with i.v. F3-Np or
F3-Cis-Np 75 μg/kg every 48 hours, 4 times, for a total of 8 days.
Tumors were harvested 24 hours after the 4th nanoparticle
treatment. Controls were treated with F3-FITC-Np 1 hour prior
to sacrifice to confirm F3-NP targeting to human vessels.
Tumors were then analyzed with coimmunofluorescence with
antihuman CD31-PE.

Results
Targeting of F3-targeted nanoparticles to TECs and
tumor cells in vitro
Blank, fluorophore-conjugated, or cisplatin-encapsulated
PAA nanoparticles were prepared with a final average size
ranging from 20 to 30 nm (Fig. 1). The PAA nanoparticle is
a hydrogel that has a high aqueous solubility and long plasma circulation time, being suitable for in vivo applications
(14, 16, 26). It also has excellent engineerability within both
nanoparticle core and surface, which allowed conjugation of
fluorophores and/or multiple targeting/visualization peptides for the current studies. F3 peptide was conjugated to
the nanoparticles for targeting. This peptide, a subcomponent of the HMGN2 protein, has shown specificity for both
human tumor cells and tumor vasculature (13–15). Alexafluor-594 was bound to the nanoparticles (Alex-Np) for visualization in initial targeting experiments. To test the ability of
the F3 peptide to target ovarian tumor cells, both mouse and
human ovarian cancer lines (mouse ID8 and human SKOV3,
A2008, and A2780) were incubated with either F3-Alex-Np
(100 μg/mL) or Alex-Np (1 mg/mL). We observed significant
binding of the F3-targeted nanoparticles to all ovarian tumor
cell lines tested (Fig. 2A). Little or no binding was observed
with nanoparticles that lacked the targeting F3 peptide. We
next tested the ability of F3-Np to bind to TECs (Fig. 2A). F3Alex-Np showed strong binding to both mouse and human
TECs. Once again, nontargeted nanoparticles showed little
or no binding.
In vitro cytotoxicity of F3-targeted cisplatinencapsulated nanoparticles
To determine the cytotoxic potential of F3-targeted nanoparticles, tumor cell lines were treated with either PBS,
F3-Cis-Np, or blank F3-Np combined with cisplatin for four
hours and then washed. The final concentration of cisplatin
in the F3-Cis-Np was 0.15 μg/mL and that of cisplatin combined with the blank F3-Np was 1 μg/mL for TEC/PBMC
experiments and 5 μg/mL for A2780 and SKOV3 experiments.
The cells were then allowed to grow for an additional

72 hours and harvested. We then assayed the number of
viable cells in each treatment group relative to the PBS control. Consistent with previous studies on nanoparticles targeting tumor cells, our experiments showed little cell death
in the nanoparticle experimental groups (Fig. 2B; refs. 27–29).
We then repeated these experiments using TECs isolated
from both murine ID8-VEGF ovarian tumors and human
ovarian cancers. Unlike what was observed for the tumor cell
lines, we found significant induction of cell death with F3Cis-Np on both mouse and human TECs. No cell death
was noted when treating control PBMCs (Fig. 2B). Thus F3targeted nanoparticles seem to be more toxic to TECs than
to tumor cell lines.
F3-Np target tumor vessels in vivo
To test the efficacy of F3 targeting in vivo we used the
highly vascular ID8-VEGF ovarian tumors model (30). Mice
bearing ID8-VEGF tumors were treated i.v. with increasing
concentrations of either nontargeted Alexa488-Np or F3targeted Alexa488 nanoparticles. Mice were sacrificed
24 hours after infusion, and multiple tissue and tumor specimens were harvested and examined via fluorescence for
nanoparticle localization. Highest specific binding to tumor
vessels without significant uptake in liver and kidney was determined at a dose of 100 mg/kg (range tested, 25–200 mg/kg;
Fig. 2C and data not shown). At this dose, nontargeted FITCNp showed little tumor-specific uptake, but were found at
significant levels in the liver and kidney. In contrast, at this
concentration we observed significant uptake of F3-FITCNp in tumor vessels and some uptake within tumor parenchyma. We noted minimal uptake of F3-FITC-Np in kupffer
cells of the liver and within the renal collecting tubules

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 2C and data not shown). No significant binding was
observed in other tissues, including the lung, heart, spleen,
intestine, and brain (data not shown).
Therapeutic efficacy of F3-Cis-Np
Next, to test the therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticles,
ID8-VEGF tumors were grown in the axillas of mice for
14 days. Mice were then treated i.v. with two weekly doses of
F3-Cis-Np, with a final cisplatin concentration of 70 μg/kg,
i.p. cisplatin at 250 μg/kg or i.p. cisplatin at 250 μg/kg, combined with i.v. blank F3-Np (total n = 15 for cisplatin or
cisplatin and F3-Np and n = 20 for F3-Cis-Np in two independent experiments) and then were sacrificed one week later.
Following the initial administration of F3-Cis-Np we observed
a rapid and significant decline in tumor volume. This was
maintained throughout the experiment. Intraperitoneal
cisplatin alone and i.p. cisplatin/i.v. F3-Np yielded identical results (data not shown). At the conclusion of the experiment, a
2.5-fold reduction in overall weight of the tumors and ∼3.5-fold
reduction in volume were noted when compared with i.p.
cisplatin alone or i.p. cisplatin/i.v. F3-Np (Fig. 3A and data
not shown). Histologic analysis of these tumors showed (a)
large regions of hemorrhage and necrosis consistent with a
potent antivascular effect and (b) a significant reduction in
the size of tumor islets with an increase in stromal tissues
(Fig. 3B).
To determine the potential toxicity of this therapy, we
collected serum from three animals in each treatment group
24 hours after the last i.v. treatment. Serum creatinine
(a marker of renal function), aspartate aminotransferase
and alanine aminotransferase (markers of hepatic function),
and complete blood counts were not significantly different

among untreated and F3-Cis-Np–treated mice (Fig. 3C). This
suggests that these nanoparticles are not excessively toxic to
normal tissues. Further supporting the safety of the nanoparticles, unlike mice treated with systemic cisplatin, we ob-

served no significant weight loss for F3-Cis-Np–treated
mice or any other adverse effects (data not shown).
We next tested the impact of nanoparticles on tumor
growth using an orthotopic i.p. tumor model. Tumors were

allowed to engraft for 10 days and then mice were treated
with either i.p. cisplatin at 250 μg/kg along with F3-Np i.v.,
i.p. cisplatin alone, or F3-Cis-Np i.v. with a final concentration of 75 μg/kg cisplatin. We observed a significant increase
in the overall survival of animals treated with the F3-Cis-Np
as compared with i.p. cisplatin alone or along with F3-Np
(Fig. 3D1 and data not shown). To determine if combining
i.v. F3-Cis-Np with i.p. F3-Cis-Np therapy could improve survival further by targeting both tumor vasculature (via i.v. dosing) and tumor cells (via i.p. dosing), we repeated the
orthotopic tumor studies and compared various combinations of blank F3-Np and cisplatin delivered i.v., i.p., or combined i.p. and i.v. versus F3-Cis-Np via i.v., i.p., or i.v. and i.p.
administration at 150 μg/kg (for i.v. or i.p. alone) or 75 μg/kg
for the both i.v. and i.p. treatments for a total cisplatin concentration of 150 μg/kg. Mice were treated on days 10, 14, 21,
and 28. We observed a significant survival advantage for all
groups that received F3-Cis-Np i.v. as compared with mice
receiving blank F3-Np combined with cisplatin. Interestingly,
combined i.v. and i.p. treatment with F3-Cis-Np did not show
a significant difference in survival (Fig. 3D). This suggest that
vascular exposure is the primary means of therapy as the
addition of i.p. therapy that could directly target tumor cells
had no added benefit.
We also tested the impact of F3-Cis-Np using s.c. human
tumor cell line xenograft tumor models. We used cisplatinsensitive Hey1 and A2780-GFP, and cisplatin-resistant SKOV3
(IC50 4 mmol/L) ovarian tumor cell lines (n = 11 in treatment
and control groups). As the human tumor xenografts with
Hey1 and A2780 cells grow more rapidly than ID8 cells we

used a more frequent treatment schedule, treating mice on
days 7, 10, and 14 after tumor engraftment with either F3Cis-Np or blank Np and systemic cisplatin as described
above. In the platinum-sensitive Hey1 and A2780-GFP tumors there was clear arrest of tumor growth during the
course of therapy as indicated both by tumor volumes and
in vivo biofluorescent imaging (Fig. 4A and B, and data not
shown). Consistent with an antivascular effect rather than an
antitumor effect, we observed a similar growth arrest with
therapy of the platinum-resistant SKOV3 tumors. Tumors
resected from these mice were extremely pale compared
with controls (Fig. 4B). Histochemical analysis of F3-CisNp–treated tumors showed a significant reduction in microvasculature and significant tumor necrosis similar to that
observed with the ID8 tumors (data not shown).
F3-Cis-Np target and eliminate human tumor
vessels in vivo
Finally, we wished to determine if the nanoparticles could
bind to human tumor vessels in vivo. We used a recently developed model of human tumor vasculature that utilizes
Hey1 tumors cells injected into H9 ESC-derived teratomas
(22, 23). In this model tumor vascular cells are derived from
human ESC and thus are human in origin. We performed i.v.
injections of F3-Alexa-Np in H9-ESC-Hey1 tumor–bearing
mice. Importantly, we observed clear binding of the F3Alexa-Np to the human CD31+ tumor vessels, confirming
the ability of these F3-targeted nanoparticles to bind to
human vessels in vivo. We therefore used this model to test
the therapeutic efficacy of F3-Cis-Np. To track tumor cell

F3-Cisplatin-Nanoparticle Therapy

growth we used immunofluorescent DsRed Hey1 tumor cells.
Once again we treated animals with either i.v. F3-Np and
systemic cisplatin or F3-Cis-Np (n = 3 controls and n = 3
treatment groups in two independent experiments). Animals
were treated on days 10, 14, 17, and 21. As in the previous
tumor models, treatment with F3-Cis-Np led to an initial loss
of fluorescence and then stabilization of disease, whereas
tumors treated with systemic cisplatin showed progressive
growth (Fig. 5).

Discussion
We used an F3-targeted polymeric nanoparticle formulation consisting of encapsulated cisplatin in a polyacrylamide
nanoparticle to target tumor vessels as a cancer therapeutic.
Although vascular-targeted nanoparticle studies have been

reported previously, to our knowledge ours is the first to
show the ability to bind to human tumor vessels in vivo.
In vitro studies showed specific binding to tumor and tumor endothelial cells. In vivo studies showed predominant
binding to microvascular TECs with lesser uptake on tumor
cells. Minimal nonspecific uptake in kupffer cells of the liver
and renal excretion of nanoparticles were noted, but nonspecific binding was minimized with titration of dose. Minimal
toxicity was noted with F3-Cis-Np treatment as evidenced by
stable creatinine, liver function tests, and complete blood
counts. This is not surprising given the total cisplatin dose
used in the nanoparticle studies (75 or 150 μg/Kg) was
∼5% the traditional dose of cisplatin (1–5 mg/kg).
In addition to being safe, F3-targeted nanoparticles seem
to be highly effective as a therapeutic. Although F3 peptides
can bind both tumor cells and endothelial cells, our studies

suggest that the primary effect of therapy was antivascular:
Similar to prior studies, minimal in vitro cytotoxicity was
noted with F3-Cis-Np treatment of human tumor cell lines
(27–29). This may be due to the higher concentration of drug
needed to kill tumor cells as evidenced by their higher IC50.
In contrast, we observed significant in vitro cytotoxicity
of F3-Cis-Np on human TECs (Fig. 2C). We also observed a
rapid impact of therapy, associated with large regions of
necrosis and hemorrhage, and a loss of clearly defined microvasculature consistent with an antivascular effect. Moreover,
F3-Cis-Np were effective even in cisplatin-resistant tumors.
Finally, like with other antiangiogenics, continuous treatment was associated with stable disease and no further
reduction of tumor was noted.
F3-Cis-Np therapy was effective in both solid tumor and
i.p. tumor models. Although the impact of therapy on flank
tumors was most dramatic, a clear survival advantage was
noted in the i.p. tumor model. The survival advantage was
primarily associated with i.v. treatment. Interestingly, the combination of both i.p. and i.v. nanoparticles did not show a clear
advantage over i.v.-only nanoparticles. This may be because the
cisplatin dose in the F3-Cis-Np is subtherapeutic to kill tumor
cells as observed in vivo. Alternatively, although we did not see
significant systemic nanoparticle exposure with i.p. delivery
(data not shown), it is possible the nanoparticles delivered
i.p. are still primarily taken up in the tumor vasculature.
Based on previous observations that F3 peptide can target
tumor cells, we chose to load our nanoparticles with cisplatin, the most active anti–ovarian tumor cell agent. Given
our observations that the F3-targeted nanoparticles seem to
be primarily targeting tumor vascular cells, cisplatin may
not be the most active chemotherapeutic. Cisplatin, a DNAtargeting agent active against actively proliferating cells, may
spare established nondividing vascular cells. We hypothesize
that F3-Np therapy with a microtubule targeting agent may
show even greater activity. Furthermore, an iRGD peptide
was recently described (21). This peptide targets the vasculature and is then cleaved to allow release of the peptide with a
now-exposed neuropilin-1 binding motif that mediates penetration of the peptide through the vasculature to target tumor
cells. Thus, a combination of F3-taxane nanoparticle and
iRGD peptide–targeted cisplatin nanoparticles could be
particularly effective, targeting neovasculature, established
tumor vessels, and tumor cells. Given the extremely low doses

of chemotherapeutic agents necessary for effectiveness of
the nanoparticles as shown in the current study, such a combination could be possible with an acceptable side effect
profile. Further experiments will be necessary to determine
the appropriate sequencing for combining these agents; vascular disruption prior to the administration of antitumor
agents could in theory reduce intratumoral drug delivery
and thereby reduce efficacy. In this context, dynamic imaging
studies may be useful to address the optimal scheduling of
combinatorial therapy.
Finally, we show for the first time the ability of vasculartargeted nanoparticles to target human TECs, both in vitro
and in vivo. We used a human ESC-based tumor model in which
a subset of the tumor vascular cells is derived from the human
ESC and consists of human tumor vessels (22). We have shown
that the vessels in this model are indeed tumor vessels, expressing unique tumor vascular markers (31). Thus, we believe that
this model represents an excellent tool for the study of therapeutics targeting human tumor vasculature.
In conclusion, we have shown that F3-targeted nanoparticles are a safe and potently effective therapeutic targeting
human tumor endothelial cells. This proof-of-principle study
shows the ability to overcome ovarian cancer chemoresistance
using vastly reduced drug concentrations by targeting nanoplatforms to the tumor neovasculature/microenvironment.
