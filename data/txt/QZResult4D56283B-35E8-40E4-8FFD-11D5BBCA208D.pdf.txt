Abstract

Author Manuscript

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
and is on the rise in the United States. Previous studies showed that the matricellular protein
CCN1 (CYR61) is induced during hepatic injuries and functions to restrict and resolve liver
fibrosis. Here we show that CCN1 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting carcinogeninduced compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, thus limiting the expansion of damaged and
potentially oncogenic hepatocytes. Consistent with tumor suppression, CCN1 expression is downregulated in human HCC. Ccn1ΔHep mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ccn1 suffer
increased HCC tumor multiplicity induced by the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosoamine (DEN).
Knockin mice (Ccn1dm/dm) that express an integrin α6β1-binding defective CCN1 phenocopied
Ccn1ΔHep mice, indicating that CCN1 acts through its α6β1 binding sites in this context. CCN1
effectively inhibits EGFR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation through integrin α6-mediated
accumulation of reaction oxygen species (ROS), thereby triggering p53 activation and cell cycle
block. Consequently, Ccn1dm/dm mice exhibit diminished p53 activation and elevated
compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in increased HCC. Furthermore, we show that a
single dose of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib delivered prior to DEN-induced injury was sufficient to
block compensatory proliferation and annihilate development of HCC nodules observed 8 months
later, suggesting potential chemoprevention by targeting CCN1-inhibitable EGFR-dependent
hepatocyte proliferation. Together, these results show that CCN1 is an injury response protein that
functions not only to restrict fibrosis in the liver, but also to suppress hepatocarcinogenesis by
inhibiting EGFR-dependent hepatocyte compensatory proliferation.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide but the
third leading cause of cancer-related deaths due to the lack of effective therapies (1). The
incidence rate of HCC in the US is on the rise, with a CDC-estimated 3.5% increase
annually (2). Being the largest organ that filters and detoxifies environmental toxins, the
liver is constantly exposed to harmful chemicals and their metabolites that can cause DNA

damage and mutagenesis, leading to oncogenic initiation. Whole-exome sequencing of
human HCC tumors revealed up to 121 mutational events per genome, suggesting that
carcinogenesis from exposure to genotoxic agents contributes to human HCC induction (3).
The progression of pre-neoplastic cells to HCC is facilitated by chronic liver inflammation,
most commonly due to hepatitis viral infection, alcohol abuse, and metabolic disorders
including obesity and type 2 diabetes (2). The rates of increase in obesity and type II
diabetes have been particularly significant, potentially driving further increases in the
development of HCC (4).

CCN1 (CYR61), a member of the CCN family of secreted matricellular proteins, regulates
diverse cellular functions principally through engagement of distinct integrins in a cell typeand context-dependent manner (5). CCN1 is critical for placental angiogenesis and cardiac
valvuloseptal morphogenesis during embryonic development (6;7). In adulthood, its
expression is linked to inflammation and wound healing, and emerging data suggest that
CCN1 serves a protective role in wound healing and tissue repair (5). For example, CCN1
functions to dampen and restrict tissue fibrosis in cutaneous wound healing by triggering
cellular senescence in activated myofibroblasts, whereupon senescent myofibroblast express
an anti-fibrotic phenotype (8). CCN1 also accelerates mucosal healing in colitis through the
induction of IL-6 (9), and functions to limit and resolve liver fibrosis induced by cholestasis
or exposure to hepatotoxin (10). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that CCN1 induces
cholangiocyte proliferation and ductular reaction to promote biliary regeneration through
integrin αvβ5-mediated activation of NFκB (11).

Aberrant CCN1 expression has been associated with various types of cancer, and may either
promote or inhibit the proliferation of specific cancer cells. For example, CCN1 promotes
the proliferation and survival of established cell lines of breast cancer, ovarian cancer,
pancreatic cancer, osteosarcoma, and glioma, and enhances their growth as tumors in
xenografts (12–16), whereas overexpression of CCN1 inhibits the proliferation of
endometrial and lung cancer cell lines both in culture and in xenografts (17;18). Consistent
with these observations, CCN1 is multifunctional and possesses activities that may either
promote or inhibit tumor growth in a contextual manner, including the induction of
angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cellular senescence (8;19–21). However, information on the
role of CCN1 in HCC cell lines has been conflicting, with reports indicating that CCN1
either inhibits or promotes the proliferation and migration of these cells (22;23). To date,
studies on proteins of the CCN family in cancer have focused on established cancer cell lines
and xenografts, and no systematic study on CCN proteins in a carcinogenesis model has
been reported.

Here we present the first evidence that CCN1 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis induced by
diethylnitrosoamine (DEN), a widely used model for HCC (24). When compared to several
murine models of HCC, DEN-induced tumors have gene expression signatures that most
closely reflect human HCC with poor prognosis (25), suggesting that DEN-induced
tumorigenesis is an excellent model for HCC. Although DEN-induced tumors do not emerge
in the context of cirrhosis, some 20% of all human HCC and up to 40% of HCC in HBVinfected individuals evolve in non-cirrhotic livers (26;27). The hepatocarcinogen DEN
induces hepatocyte DNA damage and apoptosis, leading to compensatory proliferation of

hepatocytes, some of which may have suffered mutations and are at risk of neoplastic
transformation (28). We show that CCN1 suppresses HCC tumorigenesis by inhibiting
DEN-induced compensatory proliferation through integrin-mediated accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to activation of p53 and inhibition of EGFRmediated hepatocyte proliferation. We further show that a single dose of the EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib delivered prior to DEN exposure blocked compensatory proliferation and
obliterated HCC formation. Our results support the notion that CCN1 is a response protein
for hepatic injury that suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis through inhibition of EGFRmediated hepatocyte compensatory proliferation.

RESULTS
CCN1 expression is deregulated in HCC

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The expression of CCN1 in human HCC was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of
tumor tissue microarrays (Fig. 1A). Analysis of tissue cores from 194 HCC patients and 17
normal donors revealed that all normal liver tissues displayed low to moderate CCN1
staining (intensity score 2–3), whereas nearly half (49%) of HCC cases showed undetectable
to barely detectable CCN1 (intensity score <2). However, ~44% of HCC cases had low to
moderate levels of CCN1 similar to normal livers, and 7% of cases exhibited intense CCN1
staining (intensity score >3.5). Overall, CCN1 staining was significantly lower in HCC than
in normal tissues (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.001), although there was no significant
difference among HCC of various TMN grades (Fig. 1A). Meta-analysis of Oncomine
databases showed that CCN1 mRNA was down-regulated in HCC by 70–80% compared to
normal or adjacent cirrhotic liver tissues in 4 independent studies (Fig. 1B)(29–32).
Furthermore, CCN1 is ranked within the top 4% of the least expressed genes in HCC
(median rank 318, p=5.6E-8)(Fig. 1C). Thus, CCN1 expression is significantly downregulated in a large percentage of human HCC as measured on both protein and mRNA
levels, suggesting that CCN1 may inhibit HCC development in these cases. We noted that
~7% HCC over-expressed CCN1 (Fig. 1A); possibly a subset of tumors may have acquired
mutations that mitigate the inhibitory effect of CCN1, allowing them to benefit from
potentially tumor promoting function of CCN1, such as induction of angiogenesis (19).
Ccn1 mutant mice suffer enhanced susceptibility to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis

Author Manuscript

To study the effects of CCN1 on the genesis of HCC, we employed a well-characterized
chemical carcinogenesis model in which postnatal day-15 mice injected with a single dose
of the hepatocarcinogen DEN develop HCC at a high frequency in 8 months (28). Two
genetically altered strains of mice were analyzed: one has the Ccn1 gene deleted in
hepatocytes (Ccn1ΔHep) by intercross of Ccn1flox/flox and Alb-Cre mice (10), and the other
has Ccn1 replaced by the DM allele (Ccn1dm/dm), which encodes a CCN1 mutant (DM)
disrupted in its integrin α6β1 binding sites (21). Consistent with the hypothesis that CCN1
suppresses HCC, both Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice had on average 3 times more tumors
than the wild type (Ccn1wt/wt) and Ccn1flox/flox control mice (t-Test, p<0.001) (Fig. 2A–C),
although individual variation in tumor incidence in both Ccn1dm/dm (4–21 tumors per
mouse) and Ccn1ΔHep (8–23 tumors per mouse) animals were greater than in Ccn1wt/wt and
Ccn1flox/flox control animals (3–6 tumors per mouse) (Fig. 2C). The average tumor

diameters were comparable among all genotypes with similar individual variations (Fig.
2D). Interestingly, CCN1 is either undetectable or found at a much lower level in tumors
than the surrounding parenchyma (Fig. 2E), consistent with lower CCN1 levels in human
HCC (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA and CD31 indicated no difference
in tumor cell proliferation or angiogenesis among the genotypes (Fig. 2E). These results
show that CCN1 suppresses carcinogenesis leading to HCC, and suggest that CCN1 inhibits
the frequency of tumor initiation and/or early promotion but not the rate of tumor growth
after neoplastic transformation. Since Ccn1dm/dm mice phenocopied Ccn1ΔHep mice, we
surmised that the role of CCN1 in HCC suppression is mediated through its α6β1 binding
sites.
Enhanced hepatocellular compensatory proliferation in Ccn1 mutant mice

DEN is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 in hepatocytes to produce alkylating
metabolites that form DNA adducts, leading to genetic mutations, genomic instability, and
apoptotic cell death (33;34). Apoptotic hepatocytes stimulate Kupffer cells to produce
hepatomitogens, which in turn induce compensatory proliferation of the remaining
hepatocytes, some of which may have suffered mutations and are at risk of oncogenic
transformation (28;35). Thus, compensatory proliferation after hepatic damage is thought to
promote tumorigenesis. Ccn1 expression is highly induced in the liver in response to injuries
due to hepatotoxins and cholestasis (10), and is also elevated upon exposure to DEN
(Supplementary Fig. S1). DEN-induced hepatic apoptosis reached >6 fold in Ccn1wt/wt mice
within 24 hrs of DEN injection and declined thereafter, but DEN-induced apoptosis was
significantly reduced in both Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice (Fig. 3A and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). This observation is expected, since CCN1 synergizes with TNF family cytokines
to induce hepatic apoptosis, and apoptosis induced by TNFα or FasL is substantially reduced
in Ccn1dm/dm mice (21;36). DEN injury also induced compensatory hepatocyte proliferation,
occurring with a peak at 24 hrs after DEN injection and declining thereafter (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Despite decreased apoptosis, both Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice
showed 2–3 fold increase in hepatocellular proliferation after DEN injury (p<0.05)(Fig. 3B).
Thus, compensatory hepatic proliferation is elevated in Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice,
consistent with the notion that compensatory proliferation, rather than apoptosis per se, as
the driving force for increased HCC in these Ccn1 mutant mice. These results also suggest
that CCN1 activities are mediated through its integrin α6β1 binding sites.
CCN1 inhibits hepatocyte proliferation through α6-ROS-p38 mediated activation of p53

Author Manuscript

To assess whether CCN1 may directly regulate hepatocyte proliferation, we isolated primary
hepatocytes from Ccn1wt/wt, Ccn1ΔHep, and Ccn1dm/dm mice. The presence of EGF, a known
hepatocyte mitogen, stimulated the incorporation of BrdU 4-fold (Fig. 4A). However,
addition of purified CCN1 protein abrogated EGF-induced BrdU-labeling. The DM mutant
protein has completely lost this inhibitory function, whereas D125A (37), a CCN1 mutant
protein that is unable to bind αv integrins maintained this activity, indicating that CCN1 acts
through integrin α6 and not αv to inhibit hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 4A). Hepatocytes
from Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice responded similarly to those from Ccn1wt/wt mice,
indicating that the EGF signaling pathway and cell cycle machinery in these hepatocytes are
intact. Furthermore, knockdown of integrin α6 by siRNA in hepatocytes abolished CCN1

inhibition of EGF-induced BrdU-labeling, whereas knockdown of αv had no effect (Fig.
4B), further establishing that CCN1 acts through α6 but not αv integrins to inhibit hepatocyte
proliferation.

The tumor suppressor p53 is known to inhibit hepatocyte proliferation through exerting
G1/S and G2/M cell cycle control (38;39). Knockdown of p53 by siRNA eliminated the
inhibitory effect of CCN1 on EGF-induced DNA synthesis, even though EGF alone still
promoted DNA synthesis (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of EGF receptor
(EGFR) completely eliminated DNA synthesis, demonstrating that CCN1 inhibits EGFRdependent hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 4C). Incubation of CCN1 with primary hepatocytes
increased p53 nuclear localization from being detectable in 4% to 20% of cells, showing that
CCN1 itself can activate p53 in hepatocytes (Fig. 5A). This activity was abrogated in the
DM mutant but not in the D125A mutant. Moreover, we isolated hepatocyte nuclear lysates
and found that exposure to either the CCN1 or D125A protein increased nuclear p53 by >3fold, whereas DM had no effect (Fig. 5B), indicating that CCN1 induces p53 nuclear
localization through its α6β1 binding sites.

Author Manuscript

One of the key signaling events induced by CCN1 is the accumulation of intracellular ROS
(21), which can activate the stress-activated kinase p38 MAPK that, in turn, can directly
phosphorylate p53 to increase its protein stability, nuclear localization, and transactivation
(40;41). To test whether CCN1 may activate p53 in hepatocytes through a ROS-p38 MAPKdependent pathway, we assessed the effect of the ROS scavenger BHA. Pre-incubation of
cells with BHA blocked CCN1-induced p53 nuclear localization as judged by fluorescence
staining and nuclear fractionation (Fig. 5B,C), indicating a requirement for ROS. By
contrast, the DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide also activated p53 and induced p53
nuclear localization, but BHA had no effect (Supplementary Fig. S3), showing that CCN1induced p53 activation is mediated through a ROS-specific pathway distinct from DNA
damage induced by etoposide. Furthermore, treatment of hepatocytes with CCN1 increased
the dually-phosphorylated, activated form of p38 in isolated nuclear lysates, and this
activation was blocked by pre-incubation of cells with BHA (Fig. 5B). The DM-, but not
D125A-mutation abolished the ability of CCN1 to activate p38 (Fig. 5B). Finally, siRNA
knockdown of p38α, a major isoform of p38, abrogated CCN1-induced nuclear p53
localization (Fig. 5C), whereas non-targeting siRNA had no effect. These results show that
CCN1 induces ROS accumulation in hepatocytes, thus activating p38 MAPK, which, in turn,
mediates p53 nuclear localization.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with ROS-dependent activation of p38, CCN1 induced ROS accumulation in
primary hepatocytes in ~10% of cells within 30 min. that was sustained for at least 5 hrs
(Fig. 5D). This activity was abrogated in the DM but not the D125A mutant, and blocked by
pre-incubation with a function-blocking mAb against integrin α6 (GoH3)(Fig. 5E,F). Since
CCN1 ligation to integrin α6β1 can activate the small G-protein Rac1 to trigger NOX1 and
NOX2 enzyme complexes to generate ROS (8), we further tested the involvement of Rac and
NOX. Pre-incubation with NSC23766, a Rac GEF inhibitor, or apocynin, which prevents the
assembly of Nox1 and Nox2 enzyme complexes, effectively blocked CCN1-induced ROS
(Fig. 5F). Together, these results showed that CCN1 induces ROS accumulation in

p53 activation in the liver upon DEN challenge is CCN1-dependent in vivo

Author Manuscript

Since CCN1 inhibits DNA synthesis in hepatocytes through p53 (Fig. 4C) and CCN1
enhances p53 activation in hepatocytes upon exposure to DEN in culture (Supplementary
Fig. S4), we tested whether p53 is activated in vivo in a CCN1-dependent manner upon
DEN challenge. Ccn1wt/wt and Ccn1dm/dm mice were injected with DEN, and liver protein
lysates were analyzed 1–2 days thereafter. In Ccn1wt/wt mice DEN caused a transient ~4-fold
increase in total p53 and its phosphorylation at Ser-15, a phosphorylation target of p38
MAPK that stimulates p53 transactivation (40;41), with concomitant increase in the p53
transcriptional target p21 within 1 day (Fig. 6A). By contrast, in Ccn1dm/dm mice total p53
level actually decreased by 70% and p21 level declined correspondingly (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, DEN injury in Ccn1wt/wt mice resulted in p53 nuclear localization in 20% of
hepatocytes in the liver, compared to <3% without DEN treatment. This nuclear p53
localization was greatly reduced in Ccn1dm/dm mice (<8% of cells, p<0.001), indicating that
p53 activation upon exposure to DEN is largely CCN1-dependent in vivo. Consistent with
CCN1 action through ROS, DEN challenge led to a large increase in ROS positive cells
(from <20 to ~300 cells/HPF) in Ccn1wt/wt mice, but far fewer (<100 cells/HPF) in
Ccn1dm/dm mice (Fig. 6C). These results show that CCN1 plays a key role in ROS
accumulation and p53 activation in hepatocytes upon exposure to DEN in vivo.
Blockade of EGFR inhibits HCC development

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Based on the observation that CCN1 efficiently blocked EGF-induced hepatocyte
proliferation through p53 in culture (Figs. 4), we hypothesized that CCN1 suppresses HCC
by inhibition of EGFR-dependent hepatocyte compensatory proliferation. To test this
hypothesis, Ccn1dm/dm mice were first injected with the specific EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor erlotinib or vehicle control, followed by DEN injection 3 hrs later. Immunostaining
for PCNA in livers collected 24 hrs thereafter showed that erlotinib completely blocked
DEN-induced compensatory proliferation, reducing PCNA-positive cells from 12% to
background level (<1.6%, p<0.001)(Fig. 7A). Thus, DEN-induced compensatory hepatocyte
proliferation is dependent on EGFR-signaling. Finally, we tested whether EGFR-mediated
compensatory proliferation is essential for DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Mice were
given a single injection of erlotinib 3 hrs before DEN as above, and sacrificed 8 months later
to assess HCC development. Remarkably, the single dose of Erlotinib reduced the median
number of HCC per mouse by 30-fold, from 15 to 0.5 (p<0.001)(Fig. 7B). Thus, blockade of
compensatory proliferation, which peaks within the first 24 hr of DEN injury, is sufficient to
obliterate HCC development. Together, these results show that EGFR-dependent hepatocyte
mitogenesis, which is inhibited by CCN1 through p53 activation, is required for
compensatory proliferation upon DEN-induced liver damage and for the development of
HCC.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Although great strides have been made in understanding the pathobiology of HCC, this
disease remains recalcitrant to available therapies and one of the leading causes of cancerrelated deaths. Due to the lack of efficacious treatment options, chemoprevention in highrisk groups has been proposed as an alternative strategy for reducing HCC-related
mortalities (42). Extensive studies by many laboratories have sought to unravel the
molecular basis of the tumor initiating events and the role of inflammation in HCC tumor
promotion (43). Exposure to carcinogens such as DEN causes hepatic damage and cell
death, leading to compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes, some of which may have
sustained damage and may be on their way to being transformed. Thus, DEN-induced HCC
serves as an excellent model in which to dissect the regulation of compensatory
proliferation, a critical early event in hepatocarcinogenesis (28;35). In this study, we present
the first evidence that CCN1 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting EGFRdependent compensatory hepatocyte proliferation through ROS-mediated activation of p53.
Remarkably, a single dose of EGFR inhibitor delivered prior to DEN exposure is sufficient
to prevent development of HCC (Fig. 7). These findings highlight CCN1 inhibition of
EGFR-dependent compensatory proliferation as an endogenous mechanism for suppressing
hepatocarcinogenesis, and a potential target for chemoprevention.

We have delineated a molecular pathway through which CCN1 inhibits hepatocyte
proliferation. CCN1 engagement of integrin α6, most likely α6β1, induces ROS
accumulation in hepatocytes through NOX, leading to activation of p38 MAPK and p53,
resulting in inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation (Figs. 4,5). It is interesting to note that p53
can be activated through both ROS-dependent and independent mechanisms (44;45), and
CCN1 can by itself trigger p53 activation through the α6-ROS-p38 axis independent of
DNA damage-inducing agents (Fig. 5). The role of p38α and p53 in exerting a cell cycle
block through p21 in hepatocytes has been demonstrated in the context of liver regeneration
(39). CCN1 induces p21 concomitant with p53, whereas the CCN1-DM mutant is unable to
do so (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results suggest that p38 MAPK may have a protective
role against HCC, consistent with the finding that hepatocyte-specific deletion of p38α
enhanced thioacetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice (46). However, due to the
diverse mechanisms by which p53 can suppress tumorigenesis, it is possible that CCN1activated p53 may contribute to HCC suppression through multiple pathways in addition to
inhibiting compensatory proliferation (47). Our results also underscore the fact that ROS is a
double-edge sword that may both drive tumorigenesis and inhibit tumorigenesis (48).
Furthermore, Ccn1 is regulated by the Wnt pathway and can in turn modulate Wnt signaling,
which is implicated in the development of HCC (5). However, whether the interaction
between CCN1 and Wnt signaling plays a role in hepatocarcinogenesis is currently
unknown.
Apoptosis of damaged cells, often mediated through p53, can suppress tumorigenesis by
preventing the proliferation of cells at risk of transformation. However, cell death can also
stimulate oncogenesis through activation of inflammatory responses (35). In
hepatocarcinogenesis, hepatocyte cell death due to DEN-induced damage results in
activation of Kupffer cells to express and release hepatomitogens that promote compensatory

proliferation and HCC (28). We have previously shown that CCN1 can promote hepatic
apoptosis in experimental hepatitis induced by concanavalin A, CD95-activating antibody, or
alcohol gavage by acting in synergy with TNFα and FasL pathways (21;49). Thus, it is not
surprising that Ccn1ΔHep and Ccn1dm/dm mice showed reduced apoptosis upon DENinduced injury (Fig. 3). However, despite reduced apoptosis, these mutant mice exhibited
enhanced compensatory proliferation, which is the driver of tumorigenesis. These findings
suggest that CCN1 is a powerful inhibitor of hepatocyte proliferation and removing CCN1mediated inhibition results in enhanced proliferation, overriding any shortfall in mitogenesis
that may result from reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, reduced apoptosis in Ccn1dm/dm mice
may also contribute to enhanced oncogenesis by allowing the proliferation of potentially
damaged cells. Thus, CCN1 may suppress HCC through both apoptotic and growth
inhibitory mechanisms to prevent tumor promotion in the very early stages of oncogenesis.
It is interesting to note that heterozygosity of p53 in rats is able to reduce both DEN-induced
hepatic apoptosis and compensatory proliferation, resulting in reduced hepatocarinogenesis
(50). These results are consistent with a strong correlation between compensatory
proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis, and suggest that p53 heterozygosity is sufficient to
reduce p53-dependent apoptosis but is not sufficient to obviate CCN1-mediated inhibition of
hepatocyte proliferation.

The EGFR signaling pathway is often deregulated in epithelial cancers, and EGFR
antagonists have been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic
cancer, colorectal cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma (51), although clinical response in
HCC patients is limited (52). In mouse models, EGFR inhibitors reduced HCC nodules by
4–5 fold when delivered daily for a total of 6 weeks beginning 12–13 weeks after initial
DEN injection (53;54). Here we show that a single dose of erlotinib given 3 hrs before DEN
injection strongly inhibited compensatory proliferation and reduced HCC nodules by 30-fold
(Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that one dose of EGFR inhibitor is
chemopreventive for DEN-induced HCC. Since erlotinib is metabolize quickly with a
terminal half-life of 3.1 hrs in mice (55), these results allow us to conclude that EGFRdependent compensatory proliferation occurring within a short period following DEN
exposure, which is strongly inhibited by CCN1, plays an essential role in HCC development.
These findings suggest that CCN1-regulated EGFR-dependent compensatory proliferation
may be a potential target for chemoprevention.

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that CCN1 is highly induced in human cirrhotic livers and upon
hepatic injury in mice, and CCN1 functions to limit and resolve liver fibrosis resulting from
exposure to the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride or cholestasis due to bile duct ligation by
triggering cellular senescence in activated myofibroblasts (10). Senescent myofibroblasts
express an anti-fibrotic phenotype that includes expression of matrix metalloproteinases, and
delivery of CCN1 accelerates fibrosis resolution even in mice with established fibrosis (10).
Our current study revealed that CCN1 can also suppress hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting
compensatory hepatocyte proliferation. These findings indicate that CCN1 functions as an
injury response protein in the liver that not only limits and resolves inflammation-induced
liver fibrosis, but also inhibits the genesis of liver cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and HCC Induction

Author Manuscript

Ccn1dm/dm and Ccn1flox/flox mice were generated in svJ129-C57BL/6 mixed background
and backcrossed >10 times into C57BL/6 background (8;10;21). Ccn1ΔHep mice were
generated by intercross of Ccn1flox/flox and Alb-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory)(10). To
induce HCC, male pups at 15 days old were injected i.p. with DEN (25 mg/Kg body weight)
and sacrificed for analysis 8 months later. For Ccn1wt/wt mice, 11 animals were used (n=11);
Ccn1dm/dm, n=10; Ccnflox/flox, n=7; Ccn1ΔHep, n=11. Where indicated, mice were injected
i.p. with Erlotinib [N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine
hydrochloride, 50 mg/Kg body weight] 3 hrs before DEN injection. Healthy mice bred and
maintained in our facility were randomly segregated for all experiments, and all were
processed and included in final analysis since there was no observable sign of disease or
abnormality during experiments that would have caused exclusion from analysis. No special
animal randomization was needed. The investigator was not blinded to mice genotype
allocation during the experiment. All animal procedures including estimation for numbers of
animals used (Mead’s resource equation, based on two components, control & DEN-treated,
and 5% critical value of Student’s t-Test) were approved by the University of Illinois Animal
Care Committee.
Human HCC Tissue Microarray and Histology

Author Manuscript

HCC tissue microarray (US Biomax, #LV20812 and LV2161) were processed according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Mouse liver tissues were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and
sectioned (6-μm) before immunostaining with CCN1 antibodies (10), mouse anti-PCNA
monoclonal antibody (mAb; PC-10, AbCam #ab29), mouse anti-p53 mAb (PAb 240,
AbCam #ab26), or rabbit polyclonal anti-CD31 (AbCam #ab28364). Secondary antibodies
recognizing mouse and rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare #NA931 and NA934) were conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase, using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen (brown).
Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Hepatocyte isolation and BrdU-labeling
Mouse hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described (56). For BrdU incorporation
assay, cells were incubated with 0.1 mM BrdU at 37°C for 3 hrs, fixed and stained with
mouse anti-BrdU mAb (clone BU-1, Millipore #MAB3510). After further staining with
fluorescent (Alexa-488) secondary antibody recognizing mouse IgG (Invitrogen #A11029)
and counterstaining with DAPI, samples were examined by fluorescent microscopy.

ROS detection
Intracellular ROS was determined by fluorescent microscopy using dihydrocalcein AM
(DHC-AM 10 μM in PBS, Invitrogen #D23805), which turns fluorescent green when
oxidized, as described (36). ROS-positive cells were counted in 5-randomly selected HPFs

Proteins and reagents
Recombinant CCN1 protein (wild-type, DM and D125A mutants) were produced in insect
cells using a baculovirus system and purified as described (8). Immuno-blotting employed
rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p53 (Ser15) and mAb against phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/
Tyr182, D3F9), lamin A/C (4C11), and cytochrome c (D18C7) were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Rabbit anti-EGFR (EP38Y) mAb was from AbCam. Rat anti-integrin α6 mAb
(GoH3) was from Beckman Coulter.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

The difference of CCN1 immunohistochemical staining intensities in human HCC tissue
microarray was analyzed by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test with no adjustment for
multiple comparisons. All other experiments, including the numbers and diameter of tumors
in mice, were analyzed by unpaired two-tail t-Test, with data variation showing a normal
distribution. All experiments were repeated three times with similar results.
