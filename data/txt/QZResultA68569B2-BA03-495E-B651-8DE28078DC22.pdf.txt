Abstract
Allelic deletion of the RPS14 gene is a key effector of the hypoplastic anemia in patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chromosome 5q deletion [del(5q)]. Disruption of ribosome
integrity liberates free ribosomal proteins to bind to and trigger degradation of MDM2, with
consequent p53 transactivation. Herein we show that p53 is overexpressed in erythroid precursors
of primary bone marrow del(5q) MDS specimens accompanied by reduced cellular MDM2. More
importantly, we show that lenalidomide acts to stabilize MDM2, thereby accelerating p53
degradation. Biochemical and molecular analyses showed that lenalidomide inhibits the
haplodeficient PP2Acα phosphatase resulting in hyperphosphorylation of inhibitory serine-166
and serine-186 residues on MDM2, and displaces binding of RPS-14 to suppress MDM2 autoubiquitination; whereas PP2Acα over expression promotes drug resistance. Bone marrow
specimens from del(5q) MDS patients resistant to lenalidomide over-expressed PP2Acα
accompanied by restored accumulation of p53 in erythroid precursors. Our findings indicate that
lenalidomide restores MDM2 functionality in the 5q- syndrome to overcome p53 activation in
response to nucleolar stress, and therefore may warrant investigation in other disorders of
ribosomal biogenesis.

Introduction
The 5q- syndrome is a pathologically and cytogenetically distinct subtype of
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (1, 2). Affected individuals have an isolated interstitial
deletion involving chromosome 5q [del(5q)] accompanied by a refractory macrocytic
anemia, erythroid hypoplasia, megakaryocytic dysplasia and low risk for progression to
acute leukemia. The commonly deleted region (CDR) resolved by deletion mapping
involves a 1.5 megabase segment extending between bands 5q32 and 5q33 containing 44

genes (3, 4). Although haploinsufficiency of several genes in the CDR are believed to
contribute to the disease phenotype, allelic deletion of the ribosomal processing gene,
RPS14, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, is a key determinant of ineffective
erythropoiesis (2, 5–8). Using an RNA interference screen of the CDR genes, Ebert et. al.
showed that only inactivation of RPS14 impaired erythroblast proliferation and viability,
while over-expression of RPS14 was sufficient to rescue erythropoiesis in primary del(5q)
MDS specimens (5). Disruption of ribosome assembly as a result of deletion or mutation of
genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RP) leads to nucleolar stress and sequestration of the
human homologue of the E3 ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 protein (MDM2) by
free RP, triggering its autologous degradation and consequent p53 stabilization (9–11). In
normal CD34+ cells, shRNA suppression of RPS14 gene expression activates p53 and
corresponding expression of its target genes in an erythroid lineage restricted fashion (12).
The RP-MDM2-p53 pathway has emerged as a critical effector of the erythroid hypoplasia
characteristic of del(5q) MDS and congenital anemias involving RP gene mutations such as
Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Schwachman-Diamond syndrome (13–15). A murine model
of the human 5q- syndrome generated by allelic deletion of the syntenic genes in the human
CDR showed that p53 inactivation completely rescues the hematopoietic phenotype,
indicating that the molecular pathogenesis of the 5q- syndrome is p53-dependent (16).

The thalidomide analogue, lenalidomide, is highly active in del(5q) MDS, restoring effective
erythropoiesis in more than two-thirds of patients (17, 18). We recently reported that gene
dosage of two dual specificity phosphatases encoded within or adjacent to the CDR, Cdc25C
(cell division cycle 25C) and PP2Acα (protein phosphatase 2A catalytic domain alpha),
underlies the selective suppression of del(5q) clones (19). Lenalidomide inhibits the Cdc25C
and PP2A phosphatases, which are key regulators of the G2/M checkpoint, resulting in
sustained G2/M arrest and induction of apoptosis in cells with reduced gene expression (19).
Given the importance of the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway in the hematologic phenotype of
del(5q) MDS, we investigated the regulatory effects of lenalidomide on p53. We show that
erythroid precursors in del(5q) MDS over-express p53, and that lenalidomide stabilizes
MDM2 by inhibiting its auto-ubiquitination to promote p53 degradation. Inhibition of the
haplodeficient PP2A phosphatase by lenalidomide results in hyperphosphorylation of
inhibitory serine residues on MDM2 and abrogates binding to RPS14 to suppress MDM2
autologous ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas PP2Acα over-expression promotes resistance.
Moreover, development of resistance to lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS patients was
associated with up-regulation of PP2Acα, with consequent restoration of p53 activation and
hypoproliferative anemia. Our findings indicate that lenalidomide restores MDM2
functional activity in del(5q) MDS to overcome p53 activation in response to nucleolar
stress. This pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target in patients with acquired
resistance to lenalidomide and warrants investigation in other disorders of ribosomal protein
deficiency.

Results
Lenalidomide stabilizes MDM2 and decreases p53 accumulation in del(5q) Namalwa cells
and primary MDS specimens
Nucleolar stress arising from allelic deletion of RPS 14 disrupts ribosome assembly,
resulting in stabilization of p53 in del(5q) MDS (5) (9, 12, 13, 20). MDM2 is a key negative
regulator of p53 in response to ribosomal stress that is essential to rescue primitive erythroid
progenitors from p53-mediated apoptosis (21). Given the importance of MDM2
neutralization in the hematologic phenotype of ribosomopathies, we investigated the pattern
of MDM2 and p53 expression in Namalwa cells that harbor a chromosome 5q deletion (22).
Expression of MDM2 in untreated cells was low, accompanied by corresponding upregulation of p53 (Figure 1a). Treatment with lenalidomide for 24 hours, however, resulted

in a dose dependent induction of MDM2 protein accompanied by decreased p53
accumulation (Figure 1a). This effect can be detected after both 48 and 72 hours of
treatment with lenalidomide (Figure 1b and c).
To determine if lenalidomide exerts similar effects on MDM2 and p53 in primary del(5q)
MDS bone marrow specimens, we performed similar analyses using BM-MNCs isolated
from eight individuals with del(5q) MDS. P53 expression was demonstrable in all patient
specimens by Western blot analysis prior to lenalidomide exposure, accompanied by little or
no discernable MDM2 (Figure 1d upper panel). Treatment with lenalidomide induced
MDM2 protein accumulation after 24 and 48 hours of drug exposure, while
immunodetection of p53 was reduced or eliminated. DMSO, the vehicle control for
lenalidomide had no effect, indicating a drug specific effect of lenalidomide on MDM2 and
p53. The ratio of MDM2 to p53 was analyzed using densitometric analysis showing a
significant reduction in p53 and corresponding stabilization of MDM2 induced by treatment
with lenalidomide (Figure 1d lower panel, bar graph).
Lenalidomide inhibits p53 target gene activation and disrupts RPS14/MDM2 association

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if RPS14 interacts with MDM2 in the setting of ribosomal stress and
investigate the effects of lenalidomide, Namalwa cells were treated with low concentrations
of actinomycin D (Act.D), which induced p53 expression. As shown in Figure 2a, Act.D
treatment increased RPS14 binding to MDM2 (Figure 2a, lane 2, middle panel), while
treatment with lenalidomide induced MDM2 protein expression (Figure 2a, top panel) and
either reduced (lane 3) or abolished RPS14 association with MDM2 (lane 4) at low and high
concentrations, respectively. Interestingly, lenalidomide interference with RPS14 binding to
MDM2 shows relative specificity in Namalwa cells which harbor a complex karyotype with
chromosome 5q deletion. Association of RPS19, RPL5 and RPL11 (data not shown for
RPL5 and RPL11) with MDM2 is also increased following Act. D exposure, but
lenalidomide did not alter binding to MDM2 either at low (5 µM) or high concentrations (20
µM) (Figure 2a, lower panel). More importantly, expression of p21 and PUMA, downstream
targets of p53, were similarly reduced (Figure 2b), suggesting that nucleolar stress induced
by perturbation of the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway may be overcome by lenalidomide treatment
in del(5q) MDS. To determine if lenalidomide’s modulation of RPS14/MDM2 interaction
and corresponding protein stabilization is specific for del(5q) progenitors, we preformed
similar experiments in U937 cells lacking the chromosome 5q deletion, Act.D treatment
increased RPS14 and RPS19 binding to MDM2 in U937 cells, however, lenalidomide had
no modulatory effect (Figure 2 c), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of lenalidomide is
restricted to del(5q) progenitors.

Lenalidomide modulates MDM2-p53 association via inhibition of PP2A
To investigate how lenalidomide modifies the RP-MDM2-p53 cascade, we evaluated
phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, key post-translational modifications in the regulation of
both proteins (23, 24). Although the precise kinase(s) involved in the phosphorylation of
these regulatory sites remains unclear, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occur
rapidly, resulting in either activation or inactivation of the proteins. PP2A, a lenalidomide
sensitive dual specificity phosphatase, has been implicated in the regulation of p53 by
dephosphorylating thr55 and ser46, thereby preventing proteasome-degradation and
consequent induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (WAF1/Cip1) (19, 25,
26). We investigated whether lenalidomide inhibition of the haplodeficient PP2Acα perturbs
p53 stability. Treatment of Namalwa cells with lenalidomide promoted p53 degradation with
dose proportional increased phosphorylation of thr55 and ser46, consistent with PP2A
inhibition (Figure 3a). Similarly, in response to appropriate cell cycle stimuli, PP2A is
recruited to the p53-MDM2 complex to dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues on

MDM2 and facilitate MDM2-p53 disassociation (27, 28). This prompted us to investigate
whether inhibition of PP2Acα by lenalidomide promotes MDM2 specific phosphorylation.
Treatment of Namalwa cells with lenalidomide not only enhanced total serine
phosphorylation of MDM2, but specifically increased phosphorylation of key regulatory
sites at ser166 and ser186 (Figure 3b), residues involved in the regulation of MDM2 autoubiquitination. We did not observe similar changes in phosphorylation of threonine residues.
Phosphorylation of MDM2 at ser166 and ser186 is mediated by Akt, which is responsible
for its nuclear localization and blocking p19ARF binding, thus increasing p53 degradation
(29). This suggests that lenalidomide may enhance phosphorylation of ser166 and ser186
through inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity. Indeed, treatment of cells with
lenalidomide for 48 hours promoted MDM2 nuclear localization demonstrated by MDM2
specific immunostaining (Figure 3c). Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent images
indicates that more than 61% of cells treated with lenalidomide showed increased MDM2
nuclear localization compared to untreated cells which displayed only 23% MDM2 nuclear
localization (Figure 3d). To evaluate the effect of lenalidomide on the endogenous
interaction of PP2Acα and MDM2, we immunoprecipitated PP2Acα followed by Western
blot analysis of MDM2 after lenalidomide exposure. We found that PP2Acα binds MDM2
following lenalidomide treatment in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 3e),
suggesting that lenalidomide modifies p53 stability by modulating MDM2 phosphorylation
via inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity in PP2Acα-haplodeficient del(5q) cells. To
confirm that lenalidomide’s effects on p53-MDM2 interaction are PP2A dependent, we
over-expressed PP2Acα in Namalwa cells and assessed changes in MDM2 induction and
p53 stabilization after lenalidomide treatment. Namalwa cells expressing an HA-tagged
PP2Acα construct were treated with lenalidomide for 48 hours and MDM2 and p53 protein
expression were analyzed. In comparison to pcDNA3 vector control, PP2Acα overexpression abrogated lenalidomide-mediated MDM2 induction, thereby stabilizing p53
(Figure 3f, left panel). More importantly, increased specific phosphorylation on both p53
and MDM2 induced by lenalidomide was abolished by over-expression of PP2Acα (Figure
3f, right panel). Because PP2A dephosphorylates protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt to suppress
kinase activity, inhibition of the haplodeficient phosphatase by lenalidomide in del(5q)
progenitors may also activate Akt signaling and in turn, contribute to MDM2
hyperphosphorylation. Lenalidomide treatment of Namalwa cells increased phosphorylation
of the regulatory PP2A substrate, thr308 on Akt as well as ser9 on the PKB/Akt substrate,
GSK3β (Figure 3g), indicating that lenalidomide activation of PKB/Akt may also contribute
to MDM2 phosphorylation. These data confirm the PP2Acα dependent modulation of p53MDM2 interaction by lenalidomide, and provide a plausible mechanism for development of
lenalidomide resistance in del(5q) MDS through the over-expression of PP2Acα.

Lenalidomide inhibits auto-ubiquitination of MDM2 and promotes MDM2-p53 association
As an ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2 regulates proteasomal degradation of p53, and
modifies its own stability through autologous ubiquitination (30–32) The latter activity is
modulated by phosphorylation of regulatory sites on MDM2, suggesting that PP2A
inhibition by lenalidomide may stabilize MDM2 by antagonizing self-ubiquitination. To
explore this, MDM2 and His-tagged ubiquitin plasmids were co-transfected into Namalwa
cells for 48 hours followed by treatment with lenalidomide to determine whether
lenalidomide alters MDM2 ubiquitination. Although all ubiquitinated proteins were
immobilized using nickel beads, specific MDM2 degradation is determined by Western blot
analysis using MDM2 specific antibodies. Here we show that MDM2 self-ubiquitination is
dependent upon ubiquitin co-expression (Figure 4a) and transfection of both MDM2 and
His-tagged ubiquitin accelerated MDM2 ubiquitination, as evidenced by the appearance of
multiple specific MDM2 bands (Figure 4a, lane 2). In contrast, exposure to both low [0.2
µM] and high [20 µM] concentrations of lenalidomide triggered a concentration-dependent

reduction in MDM2 ubiquitination (Figure 4a, lanes 3–4), indicating that lenalidomide
stabilizes MDM2 by inhibiting its autologous ubiquitination.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Lenalidomide treatment of Namalwa cells markedly increased binding between MDM2 and
p53 (Figure 4b). Although Namalwa cells harbor an exon 7, codon 248 mutation analogous
to that found in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (33), our findings suggest that this mutation is
not critical for p53 interaction with MDM2 in response to lenalidomide treatment. Together,
these results suggest that MDM2 rather than p53 is the critical target responsible for
lenalidomide-induced p53 degradation, likely mediated by phosphorylation dependent
inhibition of MDM2 auto-ubiquitination as shown in Figure 4a.
Reduced gene dosage of PP2Acα is a key determinant of MDM2 stabilization by
lenalidomide in del(5q) progenitors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our previous studies showed that reduced gene dosage of PP2Acα and Cdc25C is
responsible for the lenalidomide induced anti-proliferative effect on del(5q) cells (19). To
discern the role of each of the lenalidomide sensitive haplodeficient phosphatases in drug
stabilization of MDM2, we introduced a recombinant lentiviral-based system carrying
shRNA specific for either Cdc25C or PP2Aca gene transcripts into U937 cells that have a
non-del(5q) karyotype, followed by exposure to lenalidomide. Our findings show that
reduced expression of PP2Acα, is indispensible for lenalidomide induced MDM2
stabilization (Figure 4c lane 9). PP2Acα knockdown led to a 2-fold induction of MDM2 by
densitometric analysis, Cdc25C suppression yielded no change in MDM2 expression with
lenalidomide treatment compared to controls (Figure 4c lane 8). These findings were
supported by analysis of Cdc25C and PP2Acα protein expression levels showing complete
shRNA knockdown of the Cdc25C phosphatase (Figure 4c, lanes 3 and 8), whereas, 60%
suppression of PP2Acα was sufficient to induce MDM2 with lenalidomide exposure (lanes
5 and 9). Although isolated knockdown of Cdc25C did not stabilize MDM2 with
lenalidomide treatment, it enhanced MDM2 stabilization in response to lenalidomide
treatment in the setting of the dual knockdown compared to either gene alone (Figure 4c,
lane 10). Importantly, single knockdown of either Cdc25C or PP2Acα resulted in P53
activation, thereby mimicking the findings in del(5q) MDS (Figure 4c), suggesting that
Cdc25C and PP2Acα haplodeficiency may contribute to p53 activation in del(5q) MDS.
These findings are consistent with our previous observation that PP2A directly associates
with the MDM2 complex (Figure 3e), whereas Cdc25C does not (data not shown). Together,
these data confirm and provide a functional rationale for a critical role of reduced PP2Acα
gene dosage in cellular susceptibility to lenalidomide stabilization of MDM2. We previously
reported that lenalidomide directly inhibits Cdc25C phosphatase activity, but indirectly
inhibits PP2A phosphatase activity (19). To exclude the possibility that lenalidomide alters
PP2Acα gene expression, Q-PCR and immunoblot analysis were performed in both
Namalwa and U937 cells treated with or without lenalidomide. These studies show that
lenalidomide has no direct effect on PP2Aca expression at both the mRNA and protein
levels in either Namalwa or U937 cells (Figure 4 d, e and f). Furthermore, lenalidomide
stabilization of MDM2 and degradation of P53 in Namalwa cells was abrogated by specific
suppression of MDM2 by treatment with MDM2 siRNA, indicating that MDM2 is
indispensible for lenalidomide’s action to overcome p53 activation in del(5q) cells (Figure 4
g).
Secondary resistance to lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS is associated with PP2Acα and p53
up regulation
Although treatment with lenalidomide is effective in the majority of patients with del(5q)
MDS, more than half develop drug resistance within three years (3, 17). To investigate
mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS patients, we

studied sequential bone marrow specimens obtained prior to treatment, upon achievement of
transfusion independence and cytogenetic response, and at the time of treatment failure in 22
patients with low/intermediate-1 risk disease. Among these, 11 patients achieved transfusion
independence with lenalidomide treatment and subsequently experienced recurrence of
disease despite continuation of lenalidomide treatment (i.e., secondary or acquired
resistance). One patient had primary resistance to lenalidomide and 10 patients continue to
maintain transfusion independence (median duration 22.5 months; range, 7.5–68 months).
Immunohistochemical staining for p53, PP2Acα and Cdc25C protein was performed on
bone marrow biopsy sections, and results compared to bone marrow biopsies from 6 agematched lower risk non-del(5q) MDS patients and 6 age-matched normal controls.
Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was almost exclusively restricted to erythroid
precursors and was significantly higher in del(5q) MDS specimens compared to normal
controls (P=0.002) and non-del(5q) MDS (P=0.016) specimens (Figure 5a). Mean cellular
expression of p53 was significantly decreased at the time of hematologic and cytogenetic
response when compared to normal controls (P=0.04), but increased more than threefold at
the time of treatment failure (P=0.003) (Figure 5b). Mean cellular expression of PP2Acα
protein declined at the time of response to lenalidomide treatment (P=0.091), but
significantly increased at the time of treatment failure (P=0.003) (Supplementary Figure S1).
Quantitative-PCR analysis showed that the latter change in protein expression was
associated with a greater than threefold increase in PP2Acα gene mRNA at treatment failure
(Supplementary Figure S1, lower right panel). These findings confirm our laboratory
findings that PP2Acα gene expression level is a critical determinant of lenalidomide’s
capacity to promote escape from p53 arrest in del(5q) MDS erythroid precursors.
We next investigated the relationship between bone marrow changes in PP2Acα expression
and duration of transfusion independence (TI). The magnitude of reduction in PP2Acα
expression as measured by the difference between response and baseline RE (relative
expression), was significantly associated with duration of transfusion independence. Median
duration of TI was not reached (mean, 1507+days) in patients with a reduction in PP2Acα
relative expression (n=9) compared to a median TI duration of 679 days (mean 658 days) in
patients with no reduction in PP2A relative expression at time of response vs. baseline (n=4)
(P=0.006, log rank). There was no significant correlation between reduction in Cdc25C or
p53 and duration of TI.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The magnitude of reduction in PP2Acα expression as measured by the difference between
response and baseline RE, was significantly associated with a longer duration of transfusion
independence (P=0.021; hazard ratio =0.95). These data support our laboratory findings that
over-expression of the PP2Acα gene suppressed MDM2 induction and restored p53
stabilization upon lenalidomide treatment in Namalwa cells (Figure 3f), indicating that
expression level of PP2Acα is a key determinant of drug induced p53 degradation, and that
up-regulation of this key haplodeficient drug target promotes resistance to lenalidomide in
del(5q) progenitors.
Cdc25C is over-expressed in BM-MNCs from lenalidomide resistant MDS
Although reduced Cdc25C gene dosage may not singularly influence lenalidomide
stabilization of MDM2, Cdc25C was up-regulated in bone marrow cells in patients with
secondary drug resistance. We found that changes in Cdc25C sub-cellular localization after
lenalidomide treatment support the emergence of drug resistance. Immunostaining showed a
mixture of both nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution prior to treatment, whereas at the time
of treatment response, protein expression was significantly diminished (P<0.05) and was
almost exclusively restricted to the cytoplasm, consistent with drug-induced nuclear
exclusion (Figure 6a upper panel). However, Cdc25C expression was significantly increased
at the time of treatment failure (P< 0.001) and was largely limited to a nuclear distribution,

findings consistent with escape from drug inhibition (Figure 6a upper panel). Q-PCR
showed approximately a twelve-fold increase in gene message at the time of treatment
failure, consistent with transcriptional up-regulation (Figure 6a lower right panel).
Consistent with our previous results, intracellular tracking of the Cdc25C phosphatase is
regulated by cytoplasmic binding to 14-3-3 proteins (19), whereas nuclear retention of the
phosphatase is facilitated by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear export signal
(NES).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if secondary resistance to lenalidomide arises from acquired gene mutations in
p53 or target phosphatases, bone marrow DNA obtained at the time of treatment failure was
analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Among the 5 specimens analyzed, we detected no somatic
mutations within the TP53 DNA binding domain (exons 4–9) or the Cdc25C nuclear export
signal domains (exon 11) (data not shown). To exclude gene amplification of TP53 and
PP2Acα with emergence of drug resistance, we compared relative DNA sequence copy
number of both genes in 3 sequential bone marrow specimens from lenalidomide treated
patients. We utilized quantitative microsatellite analysis (QuMA) for rapid measurement of
relative DNA sequence copy number of a test locus for TP53 and PP2Acα relative to a
pooled reference and assessed using Q-PCR amplification of loci carrying simple sequence
repeats (34). DNA copy number of both TP53 and PP2Acα decreased at the time of
treatment failure compared with pretreatment specimens, indicating that amplification of
p53 and PP2Acα DNA copy number is not involved in lenalidomide induced drug resistance
in del(5q) MDS (Figure 6b). The decrease in PP2Acα copy number is consistent with clonal
expansion at treatment failure, i.e., increasing from a mixture of normal and del(5q) cells at
baseline, to 100% del(5q) by metaphase karyotyping at treatment failure.

Discussion
The RP-MDM2-p53 pathway is a critical effector of the hypoplastic anemia in patients with
del(5q) MDS and congenital anemias arising from RP gene mutations (13–15). Both
pharmacological inhibition of p53 activity in del(5q) MDS progenitors and TP53
inactivation in the syngeneic murine model of the human 5q- syndrome are sufficient to
rescue the hematologic phenotype, emphasizing the key role of p53 in the molecular
pathogenesis of the syndrome (12, 16). We confirmed that p53 is over-expressed in a lineage
restricted manner in erythroid precursors of primary human bone marrow del(5q) MDS
specimens (12), and show that treatment with lenalidomide restores MDM2 stability to
promote p53 degradation in both a cell line model and primary del(5q) MDS specimens,
accompanied by suppression of downstream p53 effector genes.

MDM2, a RING finger E3-ubiquitin ligase and key negative regulator of p53, is
indispensable for the rescue of primitive erythroid progenitors from p53-mediated apoptosis
(21). MDM2−/− null mice with homozygous wild type TP53 develop a progressive
cytopenia arising from reduced proliferative potential of hematopoietic progenitors (21).
Introduction of a single copy of MDM2 is sufficient to rescue the hematopoietic defect. Our
finding that lenalidomide not only disrupts RPS14 association with MDM2, but also
stabilizes MDM2 to promote p53 proteasomal degradation in del(5q) progenitors, suggests
that strategies to induce or enhance MDM2 activity may restore effective erythropoiesis in
disorders affecting integrity of ribosomal biogenesis.
Small ribosomal proteins such as RPL-5 and -11 are liberated upon ribosomal perturbation,
bind to the central acidic domain of MDM2, and similar to ARF, trigger auto-ubiquitination
and consequent stabilization of p53 (9, 11, 35). Inactivating mutations of the RPL5 and
RPL11 genes, however, account for up to 20% of Diamond-Blackfan anemia genotypes,
suggesting that other ribosomal proteins may compensate or compete for binding to MDM2

(36). Our studies provide the first evidence that perturbation of ribosome integrity by
treatment with actinomycin-D promotes the binding of RPS14 to MDM2 that is blocked by
lenalidomide exposure, whereas binding of RPS19, or RPL5 and RPL11 is unaffected.
Whether RPS14 binding to MDM2 occurs in del(5q) MDS or triggers MDM2 autologous
degradation is unknown, and awaits further investigation.

MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and modifies its own stability through auto-ubiquitination. This
balance is controlled by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of p53 on
inhibitory NH2 terminal serine and threonine residues, and multiple sites on MDM2 that
suppress its auto-ubiquitination and block interaction with its negative regulator ARF (37–
40). PP2A, whose catalytic domain, PP2Acα, is encoded within the proximal del(5q) CDR,
dephosphorylates these regulatory sites to uncouple MDM2-p53 association and restore p53
activation (23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 41). We found that shRNA suppression of PP2Acα in the nondel(5q) U937 cells to levels commensurate with haplodeficiency was necessary for
lenalidomide inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity and MDM2 stabilization with
consequent p53 degradation, indicating that gene dosage of PP2Acα is a critical determinant
of drug sensitivity (Figure 4c). Moreover, siRNA suppression of MDM2 completely
abrogated drug induced suppression of p53, indicating that MDM2 is indispensible for
lenalidomide’s effect on p53 dynamics in del(5q) cells (Figure 4g). Our investigations show
that treatment of del(5q) progenitors with lenalidomide resulted in concentration-dependent
hyperphosphorylation of p53 at thr55 and -ser46 (Figure 3a), and corresponding residues on
MDM2 (Figure 3), which abolished MDM2 auto-ubiquitination (Figure 4). Of interest,
hyperphosphorylation of serine residues −166 and −186 on MDM2 upon lenalidomide
exposure promoted nuclear translocation of MDM2 and p53 degradation. These specific
serine residues are phosphorylated by PKB/Akt, whose kinase activity is suppressed by
PP2A dephosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (29); (42, 43). Indeed, lenalidomide
treatment promoted retention of phospho-Thr308 on Akt as well as Ser9 on its downstream
target, GSK3β (Figure 3g), indicating that lenalidomide activates Akt signaling in del(5q)
progenitors to reinforce MDM2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of GSK3β deactivates the
protein kinase and thereby complements the effects of MDM2 stabilization by promoting
cell cycle progression (44).

Over-expression of PP2Acα, in contrast, antagonized lenalidomide’s action, preventing
induction of MDM2 and restoring p53 accumulation (Figure 3f). These findings are in
agreement with our previous studies showing that lenalidomide is a relatively weak indirect
inhibitor of PP2Acα, and indicate that over-expression of this key allelic deficient drug
target is alone sufficient to promote resistance to lenalidomide in del(5q) progenitors. Given
the weak effects in normal diploid progenitors, combined treatment with other agents that
inhibit p53 transcriptional activity such as corticosteroids, may augment its effects, and
perhaps merits consideration in ribosomopathies.
Our studies of primary bone marrow specimens from del(5q) MDS patients treated with
lenalidomide confirm its effects on p53 dynamics in vivo, and for the first time show that
transcriptional up-regulation of PP2Acα may underlie acquired drug resistance.
Immunodetection of p53 was almost exclusively restricted to erythroid precursors, and was
significantly higher in del(5q) MDS specimens compared to normal controls (P=0.002) or
non-del(5q) MDS (P=0.016) (Figure 5), consistent with perturbation of ribosomal biogenesis
(5, 16). Relative expression of PP2Acα and p53 coordinately decreased upon response to
lenalidomide treatment to levels approaching that of normal controls (P=0.04). These
findings provide a mechanistic rationale to explain drug induced escape from p53 arrest
necessary for transition to G2/M, where del(5q) cells arrest as a consequence of
lenalidomide inhibition of the haplodeficient phosphatases, PP2Acα and Cdc25C.
Moreover, the magnitude of reduction in cellular PP2Acα was directly proportional to the

duration of transfusion independence with lenalidomide treatment (P=0.006), whereas no
similar relationship was found for Cdc25C or p53, confirming the importance of PP2Acα
expression level as a determinant of response durability. Similarly, development of
resistance to lenalidomide was associated with over-expression of PP2Acα (P=0.003),
accompanied by restored p53 accumulation in erythroid precursors without evidence for
acquisition of mutations within the TP53 DNA binding domain or gene amplification.
Using a more sensitive deep sequencing technique, Jädersten et. al. identified small clones
harboring mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 in a subset of patients with del(5q)
MDS, which was associated with an increased risk of disease progression with expansion of
the mutant clone (45). Our findings that lenalidomide destabilizes p53 raises questions as to
whether checkpoint abrogation with lenalidomide treatment might modify potential for
expansion of p53 mutant clones or effect DNA repair in patients receiving concomitant
treatment with DNA-damaging agents.

Although we previously identified Cdc25C as an alternate enzymatic target of lenalidomide
in del(5q) MDS, isolated shRNA suppression of Cdc25C had no effect on MDM2 after
lenalidomide exposure. Nonetheless, dual knockdown of Cdc25C and PP2Acα further
enhanced drug induced MDM2 stabilization compared to suppression of PP2Acα alone,
suggesting a cooperative role for Cdc25C deficiency. Of interest, single knockdown of
either Cdc25C or PP2Acα activated P53 in the absence of discernable changes in MDM2
level, suggesting that Cdc25C and PP2Acα haplodeficiency may contribute to p53
transactivation in del(5q) MDS. Ito et. al. recently reported that the teratogenic effects of the
lenalidomide analogue thalidomide, arises from its binding to and inhibition of the E3
ubiquitin ligase activity of cereblon (46). The precise mechanism of inhibition remains
unclear, however, these findings raise the possibility of a shared class effect of thalidomide
derivatives on these ubiquitous molecular targets. Nonetheless, our findings provide insight
for development of novel therapeutic strategies for del(5q) MDS and congenital
ribosomopathies. Given the broad functions of PP2A in cell cycle surveillance and cell fate
decisions, PP2A-selective inhibitors may have limited utility and present potentially
excessive risk. Nevertheless, small molecules interfering with free RP binding to the MDM2
central acidic domain could prove highly effective and specific, and perhaps provide an
alternate strategy to overcome acquired resistance to lenalidomide in patients with del(5q)
MDS.

Patients and preparation of bone marrow specimens

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Patients with del(5q) treated or untreated (n=30) were recruited from the Malignant
Hematology clinic at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute and the Taussig
Cancer Center at Cleveland Clinic. MDS diagnoses and karyotype were confirmed by
central review and classified in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.
After obtaining written informed consent, bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) were
isolated from heparinized bone marrow aspirates by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation,
as previously described (19).
Western blotting analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell lysates prepared from BM-MNCs from del(5q) MDS patients or from Namalwa cells
that were treated with lenalidomide at concentration of 10 µM unless otherwise indicated for
24h, and 48h. DMSO was added as vehicle control. Cells were harvested and lysed at 4°C
for 30 min in 1% NP-40, 10 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM ethylenediamene tetra acetic acid, 1
mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.25% Na Deoxycholate, 100 µl protease inhibitor cocktail I and
cocktail II (Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min to pellet cell debris
and the supernatant containing protein lysate was collected. The protein concentration was
determined using the Bio-Rad (Bradford) protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Separation of 30 µg of total protein was performed on 8.5% or 10% SDS–polyacrylamide
gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane before Western blotting with the primary
antibodies indicated. The specific proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce).
RNA Isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total RNA was purified from BM-MNCs isolated from del(5q) MDS patients using RNeasy
Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia,CA, USA). Reverse
transcription (RT) reactions were performed using iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit (BIORAD, Hercules, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized by adding 1 µg of total RNA, 4 µl of 5×
iScript Reaction Mix, and 1 µl of iScript Reverse Transcriptase for a total volume of 20 µl.
The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 30 min, and 85°C for 5 min.
Oligonucleotide primers for amplifying TP53 were P53-F (5’- GTA CAT CTG GCC TTG
AAA CC-3’) and p53-R (5’-AGC TGC CCA ACT GTA GAA AC-3’). Primers for
amplifying MDM2 were MDM2-F (5'-GTC AAT CAG CAG GAA TCA TCG -3') and
MDM2-R (5'- CCT TTT GAT CAC TCC CAC CTT -3'). Primers for amplifying PP2Acα F(5'- TCT CAC TGC CTT GGT GGA T -3'’- and PP2Acα -R (5'- CCC TCA TGG GGA
ACT TCT T -3'). Primers for amplifying GAPDH were GAPDH-F (5’-GAA GGT GAA
GGT CGG AGT-3’), and GAPDH-R (5’-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3’). Q-PCR
reactions were performed by means of iQ SYBR Green Supermix of Bio-Rad. Each reaction
(25 µl) contained 12.5 µl of iQSYBR green supermix, 0.25 µl of forward primer (20µM),
0.25 µl of reverse primer (20µM), 11 µl of RNase-free water, and 1.0 µl of cDNA. The
following cycles were performed 1×3 min at 95°C, 40 amplification cycles (15 s 95°C, 60 s
56°C), 1 × 1 min 95°C, 1 × 1 min 55°C and a melting curve (80 × 10 s 55°C with an
increase of 0.5°C per 10 s). A negative control without cDNA template was run with every
assay. The optimal melting point of dsDNA I and the efficiency of the reaction were
optimized beforehand. Transcript copy number per subject was calculated by normalization
to GAPDH expression.
Preparation of Cdc25C, PP2A, MDM2 RNAi and Lentivirus—Preparation of
lentiviral vectors containing shRNA is as previously described (19). Briefly, Nucleotide
sequences for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were described and designed for ShRNA-

Cdc25C as follows: sense strand, 5’-GAAGAGAATAATCATCGTGTT –3’ and antisense
strand, 5’-GAAGAGAATAATCATCGTGTT-3’, for shRNA-PP2Acα were designed as
follows: sense strand, 5’-TGGAACTT GACGATACTCTAA-3’, antisense strand, 5’TGGAACTTGACGATACTCTAA-3’ A scrimbord RNAi sequence was used as a
nonspecific control. Oligonucleotides were designed that incorporated these sequences
within a short hairpin structure, using the stem loop sequence 5’- CTCGAG-3’, which were
then cloned into lentiviral plasmids (pLKO.1-puro purchased from Sigma). Lentiviral
particles were generated by transfection of lentiviral plasmids and packaging mix (purchased
from Sigma) into HEK-293-T cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).
Supernatant containing viral particles were harvested between 36–72 hours. The supernatant
was purified and used for Cdc25C and PP2A knocking down experiments. Non-target
shRNA were used as negative control, and lentiviral vectors containing GFP were used to
evaluate the infection rate. For lentiviral infection, 0.5 × 106/ml of U937 cells were
incubated with recombinant lentiviruses at MOI=1:5 in the presence of 8µg/ml of polybrene
for 48 hours before treatment with lenalidomide.

For experiments using MDM2-siRNA, MDM2 siRNA and scrambled siRNA control were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotecnology. Namalwa cells were plated at 2×105 cells /well in
a 6-well plate overnight. Transfection was then performed by adding a mixture of 0.2 µM
siRNA-MDM2 or siRNA-control and 10 µl of lipofectin-2000 into each well in RPMI
medium-10%FBS. After 48h of incubation, Western blot analysis of cell lysates was
performed using anti-MDM2 or anti-p53 antibodies.
Analysis of DNA copy number by Q-PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA was prepared using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen,Inc,Valencia,CA,
USA) from MDS patient BM specimens. Copy number estimation by Q-PCR was carried
out in duplicate 25 µl reactions with 12.5 µl of iQSYBR green supermix, 0.25 µl of forward
primer (20µM), 0.25µl of reverse primer (20 µM), 20 ng genomic DNA. PCR cycling
condition was performed at 95°C for 15 sec, 56°C for 1min for 40 cycles. The primers used
for Q-CPR were as follows: Cdc25C (NC_000005), forward, 5'- AGA GCA AGA CCC
TGT CTC AA -3', reverse, 5'- TCT CAT CCT TCC TTC ACA GC -3'; PPP2cα
(NC_000005), forward, 5'- ATT GCC CAG TCT TGT CTC G -3', and reverse 5'- TTC
AGG CTG GGC ACT GTA T -3'; p53 (NC_000017), forward 5'- TGT CAT CTC TCC
TCC CTG CT -3', and reverse, 5'- TCT GAG TCA GGC CCT TCT GT -3'. We used
plasmids, which we designed gene products flanking forward and reverse primers for each
gene and inserted into vectors pIDTSMART-KAN (IDT, Inc,), as the templates for the
standard curve. A 10-fold serial dilution series of the plasmids ranging from 1×10 to 1×107
copies/ µl was used to construct the standard curves for Cdc25C, PPP2cα and TP53. 2 µl of
the plasmids were added to each well. The copy number was calculated using the following
equation (47):

CT values in each dilution were measured in duplicate using Q-PCR to generate the standard
curves for PPP2cα and p53, respectively. Absolute quantification determines the exact copy
concentration of target gene by relating the CT value to a standard curve.

for PCR amplification. Primers for TP53 exons 4–9 have been previously described (48).
Cdc25C nuclear export signal primers are forward,5’GGTGGACAGTGAAATGAAATATTTGGG-3’ and reverse, 5’TTCTGGCTATGAGGGTTGCTGGAT-3’. DNA was amplified using iProof™ High
Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Biorad, Hercules, CA). The PCR products were separated on
1.8% agarose with ethidium bromide and purified with Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean UP
System (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products were sequenced with BigDye® Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI) and a 3130×1 Genetic Analyzer (ABI).
Immunohistochemical staining

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Antibodies to Cdc25C, PP2Acα and p53 were used for immunohistochemical staining. The
rabbit anti-human antibody recognizing Cdc25C (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) was
used at a 1:125 concentration. The rabbit anti-human antibody recognizing PP2Acα (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA) was used at a 1:25 concentration. The mouse monoclonal primary
antibody for p53 (Ventana) was used at a prediluted strength according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as follows: the
paraffin embedded blocks from BM core biopsies were cut into 4-µm sections and
deparaffinzed on the automated system with EZ prep solution (Ventana). Heat-induced
antigen retrieval method was used in cell conditioning 1 (Ventana). Incubation with primary
and secondary antibodies was based on preset conditions. Immunohistochemical stains were
performed conditionally per manufacture’s instructions by Ventana Discovery XT
automated system (Ventana Medical System, Tucson). The detection system used was the
Ventana OmniMap Kit. The stained slides were dehydrated and cover slipped for a
pathologist’s evaluation. Percentage and strength of staining (scored 0, 1+, 2+ 3+ or
between) were documented in Excel spread sheet.
Immunofluorescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Namalwa cells (3 ×105/ml) were treated with lenalidomide (10uM) or DMSO for 48 hours,
centrifuged onto microscope slides and fixed with methanol/acetone (3:1) in −20 °C for 30
min. An anti-MDM2 antibody (1:200 dilution) and secondary goat anti-mouse Ig
AlexaFluor (594) (Sigma) was used to visualize the translocation of MDM2. Nuclei were
stained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence was detected using a Leitz Orthoplan 2 microscope
and images were captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with the Smart
Capture Program (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). On each slide, 100 cells were counted for
MDM2 nuclear translocation. Nonspecific binding with secondary antibody alone was not
detected (data not shown). Immunoflorescent images were analyzed using Image Pro Plus
6.2 (Mediacybernetics Inc., Maryland) as previously described (19), and the percentage of
cells with increased nuclear signal was recorded.
In situ ubiquitination assay
Namalwa cells in 9-cm plates were transfected with 4 µg of His tagged 6-ubiquitin
expression plasmid and 4 µg of MDM2 plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen).
Thirty-two hours after transfection, cells were cultured with 40 µM MG132 for 4hours. Cells
from each plate were collected into two aliquots. One aliquot (10%) was used for
conventional Western blotting to confirm expression and degradation of transfected proteins.
The remaining cells (90%) were used for purification of His-tagged ubiquitin proteins by
adding 30 µl Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) beads (Qiagen) for each plate. The cell pellet
was lysed in buffer A (6 M guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl
[pH 8.0], 5 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with NTA beads for
4 hours at room temperature. The beads were washed with buffer A, buffer B (8 M urea, 0.1
M Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 10 mM β -mercaptoethanol), and buffer C
(8 M urea, 0.1 M Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl [pH 6.3], 10 mM β-2Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 23.

M Tris-Cl [pH 6.7], 30% glycerol, 0.72 M β -mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS). The eluted
proteins were analyzed by Western blotting for MDM2 (3G9) and p53 antibodies.
Statistical analysis
Relative expression (RE) of p53, Cdc25C, and PP2Acα was assessed using the product of
the percentage of positive cells/high powered field (HPF) in the bone marrow specimens and
staining intensity. The mean RE for p53 was compared between del(5q) patients, nondel(5q) specimens and normal controls using an independent t-test. The mean RE of each
parameter was compared at baseline, time of response and time of failure using a paired t
test. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to calculate duration of transfusion independence in
patients who achieved a reduction PP2Acα relative expression at time of response compared
to those who did not; log rank test was used to compare the difference between the two
groups.

Figure 1. Lenalidomide induces MDM2 expression and down-regulates p53 in del(5q) Namalwa
cells and primary MDS specimens

(a), Lenalidomide (Len) induces MDM2 expression and down-regulates p53 protein in a
concentration dependent manner. Namalwa cells were exposed to various concentrations of
lenalidomide for 24 hours and Western blotted for p53 and MDM2. (b–c) Cells were also
exposed to various concentrations of lenalidomide for either 48hours (b) or 72 hours (c) at
which time protein lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-MDM2 antibody. (d)
BM-MNCs isolated from four MDS patients with del(5q) were treated with 5 µM
lenalidomide (Len) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 hours or 48 hours before Western blot
analysis with either anti-MDM2 or anti-p53 antibodies (upper panel). Densitometric analysis

as indicated (left panel). Densitometric analysis was performed on Western blots shown in
left panel and the level of MDM2 phosphorylation was normalized with total MDM2 as
indicated (right panel). (c) Lenalidomide promotes MDM2 nuclear translocation. Namalwa
cells were treated with lenalidomide or DMSO at a concentration of 10 µM for 48 hours, as
indicated. Cells were cytospinned and stained with anti-MDM2 antibody, followed by
AlexaFlour-594 secondary antibody. Nuclei were counter stained with DAPI (original
magnification 400×). (d) Quantitative analysis of the MDM2 nuclear translocation in
lenalidomide treated cells compared to DMSO treated controls. (e) Lenalidomide enhances
association of PP2A with MDM2. Namalwa cells were treated with DMSO or lenalidomide
at various concentrations as indicated. Protein lysates were prepared and
immunoprecipitated with anti-PP2A followed by Western blot analysis with anti-MDM2
antibody. The findings are representative of three separate experiments. (f) Over-expression
of PP2Acα down-regulates MDM2 expression induced by lenalidomide. Namalwa cells
were transfected with plasmids containing either pcDNA3 vector control or HA-tagged
PP2Acα and then treated with lenalidomide at a concentration of 20 µM for 48h. Protein
lysates were prepared and Western blotted with antibodies specific to MDM2, p53, HAPP2A and β-actin (left panel). Protein lysates were also used for immunoprecipitation with
anti-MDM2 or p53 antibodies following Western blot analysis with specific phosphorylation
antibodies to MDM2 or p53 as indicated (right panel). (g) Protein lysates were prepared
from Namalwa cells treated with or without lenalidomide at concentrations of 0.2, 2 or 20
µM and Western blot analysis performed using antibodies specific to either phospho-Akt
(thr308) or phospho-GSK3β (ser9) as indicated.
