ASNA-1 Activity Modulates Sensitivity to Cisplatin
Oskar Hemmingsson, Gautam Kao, Maria Still, and Peter Naredi

Abstract
Cancer can be cured by platinum-based chemotherapy, but resistance is a major cause of treatment failure.
Here we present the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study interactions between the platinum
drug cisplatin and signaling pathways in vivo. Null mutation in a single gene, asna-1, makes worms hypersensitive to cisplatin. The metalloregulated ATPase ASNA-1 promotes insulin secretion and membrane insertion of
tail-anchored proteins. Using structural data from ASNA-1 homologues, we identify specific ASNA-1 mutants
that are sensitive to cisplatin while still able to promote insulin signaling. Mutational analysis reveals that
hypersensitivity of ASNA-1 mutants to cisplatin remains in absence of CEP-1/p53 or apoptosis. Human ASNA1
can substitute for the worm gene, indicating a conserved function. Cisplatin sensitivity is not affected by
decreased insulin signaling in wild-type nematodes or restored insulin signaling in asna-1 mutants. These
findings provide a functional insight into ASNA-1, demonstrate that C. elegans can be used to characterize
cisplatin resistance mechanisms, and suggest that rationally designed drugs against ASNA-1 can sensitize cancer
cells to cisplatin. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10321–8. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Mammalian responses to metals have implications in both
cancer chemotherapy and environmental toxicology. Use of
the platinum compound cisplatin has improved the outcome
for cancer patients for more than 3 decades. Recent development of oxaliplatin for treatment of colon cancer and arsenic
trioxide for acute myeloid leukemia has increased the interest
in metal complexes (1). Cisplatin interacts with DNA, resulting
in DNA adducts that inhibit both replication and transcription
(2). It induces apoptosis or necrosis in tumor cells whereas
dose-limiting side effects also occur in non-dividing cells like
neurons and nephrons (3). Although cisplatin can cure cancer,
most tumors eventually develop a multifactorial resistance
and some are intrinsically resistant. Addressing the causes of
this treatment failure remains a longstanding and relevant
question. A combination of cisplatin and a targeted drug for
increased tumor sensitivity would improve outcome for cancer patients.
Our work with cultured human cells suggests that ASNA1 is
a potential drug target to circumvent cisplatin resistance.

(4, 5) whereas tumor cells with downregulated ASNA1 expression display increased apoptosis and increased sensitivity to
cisplatin and arsenite (5, 6). This is consistent with the
previous observations that cisplatin-resistant cells are
cross-resistant to arsenite and antimonite (7, 8) and that
ASNA1 is a well-conserved homologue of a subunit of a
bacterial efflux pump for metalloids (9–11).
ASNA1 has ATPase activity that is stimulated by arsenite
(12), and the protein is detected in the cytoplasm, the
perinuclear region, and the nucleolus (13). Recently, ASNA1
gained much interest as the first identified factor for membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins (TA-proteins),
which are involved in diverse important functions like
vesicular transport (SNAREs) and apoptosis (Bcl-22; refs.
14–18). ASNA1 could mediate cisplatin resistance through
these pathways because vesicular efflux of cisplatin has been
reported (19) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is upregulated in
cisplatin-resistant cells (20). Although the role for ASNA1
in insertion of TA-proteins is intensively studied in yeast,
less is known about the functions of ASNA1 in metazoans
in vivo. Reduced expression of ASNA1 in cell lines results in
retarded growth (5), and knockout of ASNA1 in mouse
causes embryonic lethality (21). Therefore, it has not been
possible to study phenotypes in complete absence of ASNA1.
Here, we developed a model to study cisplatin in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which genetic asna-1
null mutants can be used. C. elegans is a well-established
organism to study individual signaling pathways in response
to drug exposure (22). Human and C. elegans ASNA-1 share
54% amino acid sequence identity and a conserved ATPase
domain. C. elegans asna-1 null mutants have greatly
decreased insulin/insulin like growth factor signaling activity that can be rescued by expression of the human ASNA1
gene, indicating conservation of function (23).

Here we ask whether asna-1 mutants are sensitive to cisplatin and whether this would be due to apoptosis, retarded
growth, or lack of ASNA-1–promoted insulin signaling.

Methods
C. elegans techniques
Handling of C. elegans strains was as described (24). Experiments were carried out at 20 C unless stated otherwise. N2 is
the wild-type parent for all strains in this study. Injection RNAi
and feeding RNAi were done as described (25). For injection
RNAi of asna-1 or zk637.4, the full-length cDNA clone was
amplified by PCR using primers with T7 promoter sequences
at the 50 ends. The amplified DNA was used as substrate for in
vitro synthesis of dsRNA and its subsequent cleanup using a
kit (Ambion) following manufacturer's suggestions. asna-1
(sv42) was isolated from a deletion library (23). asna-1
(ok938), zk637.3 (gk367), cep-1(gk138), egl-1(n1084n3082),
daf-2(e1370), and daf-7(e1372) were obtained from the C.
elegans Genetics Center.
Plasmids and transgenic strains
pVB202GK: Pasna-1::humanASNA1
pVB222GK: Pasna-1::asna-1::GFP, GFP fused to the last codon of
asna-1
pVB275GK: Pelt-2::asna-1
pVB277GK: Pdaf-28::asna-1
pVB308GK: Posm-6::asna-1
The plasmids listed earlier in the text and the transgenic
strains generated using these plasmids have been described
previously (23). The worm strain bearing the transgene containing pVB222GK was integrated into the genome. In all other
cases the transgenes were maintained as extrachromosomal
arrays. The osm-6 promoter is expressed only in head neurons
(26), and the neuronal wild-type expression of asna-1 is in a
subset of these head neurons (23). The elt-2 promoter is
exclusively expressed in the intestine (27), and the daf-28
promoter is expressed in the intestine and in head neurons (28).
pVB402GK: Same as pVB222GK except for a 3bp deletion for
the His164 codon.
pVB464GK: Same as pVB222GK except for change of codons
285 and 288 from cysteine to serine.
pVB402GK and pVB464GK were expressed in worms on
extrachromosomal arrays generated by coinjecting 50 mg/mL
of each plasmid along with pCC:GFP at 50 mg/mL (which is
expressed in coelomocytes) to follow the inheritance of the
transgenes.
pVB507GK: full length ced-3 cDNA cloned into feeding RNAi
plasmid L4440 as a Nhe1/Sac1 fragment.
Antibodies and Western blot
Worms were lysed in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150
mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and loading
dye with DTT. Worms were centrifuged at 13,600 rpm for 1
minute, suspended in lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 minutes.
Lysates were separated in a 10% SDS gel and transferred to

immobilon-p filters (Millipore) prior to ASNA-1 detection by a
rabbit anti-worm ASNA-1 polyclonal antibody (23). Loading
control was performed by Coomassie (Serva) staining of the
immobilon-p filter or by stripping of the filter in 1 mol/L of
Glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) for 10 minutes and 1mol/L of Tris (pH
7.5) for 10 minutes followed by detection of a-tubulin by a
mouse anti-tubulin antibody. Loading density was quantified
by the Quantity One 4.5.6 software.
Chemosensitivity assays
asna-1(rnai) animals arrest as L1 larvae and to obtain the
same condition for wild-type strain N2, worms hatched in the
absence of food. L1-arrested larvae were transferred to nematode growth medium (NGM) plates containing 0 to 250 mg/mL
of zinc chloride (G€
oteborgs termometerfabrik); 0 to 200 mg/
mL of cadmium chloride (Sigma); 0 to 50 mg/mL of potassium
antimonyl tartrate (Sigma); 0 to 300 mg/mL of sodium arsenite
(Sigma) or 0 to 500 mg/mL of cisplatin (Platinol Bristol Myers
Squibb). Larvae were incubated for 24  1 hours at 20 C on all
metal-containing plates except on cadmium chloride, where
they were kept for 72  1 hours due to delayed toxicity. To test
the effect of metal salts on adult worms, they were maintained
on MYOB agar [275 mg Tris-Cl (Sigma), 120 mg Tris-OH
(Sigma), 1.55 g Bacto-peptone (Becton Dickinson), 800 mL
cholesterol 5 mg/mL (Sigma), 1 g NaCl, 10 g agar (Merck), and
250 mL H2O gave 2x MYOB medium] with 0 to 500 mg/mL of
cisplatin, 0 to 600 mg/mL of sodium arsenite, 0 to 1600 mg/mL of
zinc chloride, or 0 to 1500 mg/mL of copper sulfate. The adult
animals were fed with OP50 strain of Escherichia coli transferred from NGM plates. Wild-type (N2) and worms heterozygous for an asna-1 mutation (ok938 and sv42) were used as
controls on cisplatin agar. Young adult worms were incubated
for 24  1 hours at 20 C on metal-containing plates, and death
was determined by absence of touch-provoked movement
when they were probed with a platinum wire. To test chemosensitivity in solution, young adult worms were exposed for 24
hours to 0 to 500 mg/mL of cisplatin in S-medium. They were
then transferred to an agar plate on which death was determined by absence of touch-provoked movement.
Chemotaxis assay
One side of a MYOB plate without cisplatin was cut out, and
MYOB medium containing 300 mg/mL cisplatin was poured in
that area. Age-synchronous young adult worms were put in
the middle of the plate, and the ratio of worms on each side of
the plate was determined after 1 hour.
Pharyngeal pumping rate
Worms were exposed to control medium or medium containing 300 mg/mL cisplatin on plates for 2 hours. The
pharyngeal pumping rate of the worms lying in the plates
was measured using a dissection light microscope.
Site-specific mutagenesis of asna-1
Multiple amino acid sequence alignments were done using
the ClustalW Service (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The
protein source and GenBank accession numbers of the
aligned sequences are Homo sapiens (AAC03551), C. elegans

(P30632), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP_010183). Deletion
of the ASNA-1 His164 codon and the substitution of serines for
Cys285 and Cys288 were performed using mutagenic primers.
These were designed for both strands to amplify the gene in 2
parts using outside primers corresponding to the beginning of
the asna-1 promoter and the last codon of asna-1. Both
outside primers were designed to have Sph1 sites. The 2
obtained fragments were mixed and subjected to a second
round of PCR using the outside primers. The resulting 1.9 kb
PCR fragment was digested with Sph1 and cloned into the GFP
vector pPD95.77 that had been linearized with Sph1. This
resulted in asna-1:gfp fusion genes in which gfp was fused to
the last codon of asna-1. Both constructs were fully sequenced.
daf-2 Experiment
The daf-2(e1370) mutant is a temperature-sensitive strong
loss-of-function mutant (29). Mutants grow reproductively at
15 C and do not enter the dauer state. Mutants grown throughout their life at 25 C become dauer larvae and never reach
adulthood because of loss of gene activity. To obtain daf-2
(e1370) mutant adults with greatly reduced gene activity,
worms have to be shifted from 15 C to 25 C after the L2 stage
when commitment to the dauer state is no longer possible. Agesynchronous N2 and daf-2(e1370) mutants were grown at 15 C
(the non-dauer permissive temperature) to late L2. Worms
were then shifted to 25 C to reduce or eliminate daf-2 gene
function in daf-2(e1370) mutants. asna-1(ok938) mutants were
grown at 20 C. One day after the L4 stage, young adults were
transferred to cisplatin plates at 25 C. Death was scored after
24-hour incubation on cisplatin containing MYOB plates.

after 96 hours by determining the number of adult (nondauer) worms on the plates. This ability of transgene-bearing
daf-7 mutants grown at 25 C to leave the dauer state and
progress to adulthood is termed dauer escape. No dauer
escape was seen among daf-7(e1372) control animals lacking
a transgene, confirming that the temperature of the incubator
was nonpermissive for daf-7 dauer exit.
Microscopy
The worms were anesthetized by mounting them in a drop
of M9 containing 1 mmol/L of levamisol on a microscope slide
containing a 2% agar pad. Worms were examined by microscopy within 10 minutes after mounting. Cisplatin influence
on tissue morphology was determined using a 100 objective
in a Leica DMRP microscope, and photographed with Deltapix
DP450 software. Body volume was measured at 5 (Leica
DMRP and Deltapix DP450 software) by SnapMeasure in
Adobe Illustrator CS3 13.0.2. Body volume was calculated as
the cylindrical volume between the pharynx and the rectum.
Statistical analysis
LC50 values were determined using a binary logistic regression model. The c2 test was used to calculate level of statistical
significance when comparing survival at a single metal salt
concentration. A Mann–Whitney test was performed to compare ASNA-1 density levels on Western blots, pharyngeal
pumping rates, and body volumes. A level of significance
was set at 0.05. SPSS 18.0 for Mac OSX was used for statistical
analysis.

Results
daf-7 Dauer escape assay
The strong temperature sensitive daf-7(e1372) mutant (30)
was used to reduce DAF-7 activity. The mutants grow reproductively (non-dauer) at 15 C but become 100% dauer larvae
at 25 C. daf-7(e1372) mutants carrying pVB402GK or
pVB464GK expressing ASNA-1DH164 and ASNA-1C285S C288S,
respectively, were grown at 25 C. Dauer escape was evaluated

To determine the effect of ASNA-1 on chemoresistance,
asna-1(rnai) animals (which arrest as L1 larvae; ref. 23) were
tested along with arrested wild-type larvae of the same age.
We observed a significant increase in sensitivity to cisplatin,
sodium arsenite, and antimony potassium tartrate in asna-1
(rnai) larvae compared with wild-type larvae (Table 1). No

Worms were injected with asna-1 dsRNA and the progeny arrested in the first larval stage L1 due to absence of ASNA-1–promoted
insulin signaling. Embryos were hatched on agar plates without food to induce L1 arrest in the wild-type strain N2. Larvae were
exposed to various concentrations of cisplatin, arsenite, antimonite, and zinc for 24 hours, or to cadmium chloride for 72 hours. Death

difference was observed in sensitivity to cadmium chloride or
zinc chloride. In agreement, cisplatin-resistant tumor cells are
cross-resistant to arsenite and antimonite (7, 8) and ASNA1
underexpressing mammalian cells are hypersensitive to the
same metal salts (5, 6). This emphasizes the similarity in the
resistance pattern among worms, cell lines, and resistant
tumor cells.
Next, we tested chemoresistance in 2 asna-1 mutants, ok938
(11, 23) and sv42 (23), which bypass the L1 arrest and grow to
become sterile thin adults due to deposit of asna-1 gene
product from the mother that is heterozygous for the asna-1
mutation. Adult wild-type worms and asna-1 heterozygotes
were intrinsically resistant to the maximum possible cisplatin
concentration in agar (500 mg/mL; Supplementary Fig. S1). By
contrast, both asna-1(ok938) and asna-1(sv42) mutants were
cisplatin sensitive and died within 24 hours, displaying a LC50 of
251 mg/mL and 235 mg/mL, respectively (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S2; P < 0.001 compared with wild type for both
observations). The sv42 deletion affects both asna-1 and the
upstream genes zk637.4 and zk637.3. zk637.4(rnai) worms and
zk637.3(gk367) mutant worms were not sensitive to cisplatin
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Further, because worms bearing a
deletion of asna-1 alone in the asna-1(ok938) strain were as
hypersensitive to cisplatin as the asna-1(sv42) mutants, we
conclude that inactivation of asna-1 alone is sufficient to cause
cisplatin hypersensitivity. This is confirmed by a rescue experiment described later in this article. Consistent with a previous
report (11), asna-1 mutants were also hypersensitive to arsenite

10324

with a LC50 of 111 mg/mL compared with 279 mg/mL in wild
type (P < 0.001; Fig. 1B). Cisplatin shares resistance pattern and
plasma membrane transporters with copper (31–33). The LC50
for copper in asna-1 mutants (500 mg/mL) was significantly
lower than that of wild-type animals (849 mg/mL), P < 0.001
(Fig. 1C). As with the larval asna-1(rnai) experiment, there was
no difference in sensitivity to zinc chloride between the
mutants and the controls (Fig. 1D). This indicates that
asna-1 mutants display a substrate-specific phenotype related
to cisplatin, arsenite, and copper rather than general metal
sensitivity. C. elegans asna-1 mutants expressing either wildtype asna-1 or human ASNA1 on transgenes were both rescued
for the cisplatin hypersensitivity phenotype (Fig. 1E). Thus,
human ASNA1 can substitute for the worm homologue and
likely mediates cisplatin resistance by conserved mechanisms.
Cisplatin-resistant human tumor cells generated by serial
exposure to cisplatin overexpress ASNA1 (5, 6). In C. elegans,
we observed an increase in ASNA-1 protein levels after 48-hour
exposure to 100 or 200 mg/mL cisplatin in agar plates (Fig. 1F).
A 2.8  0.35-fold increase in the steady state levels of ASNA-1
protein was detected in worms exposed to 200 mg/mL cisplatin
(P < 0.05).
We asked whether asna-1 mutants display increased chemosensitivity because of an inability to sense and avoid
chemicals. To test this we first determined the pharyngeal
pumping rate after 2 hours on agar with or without cisplatin.
asna-1 mutants on cisplatin agar had decreased pharyngeal
pumping rate compared with wild type (Supplementary

Figure 2. Blockage of apoptosis has no effect on cisplatin sensitivity. Young adult worms were exposed to control agar (black bars) or agar containing
300 mg/mL cisplatin (gray bars). Bars represent mean survival  SEM after 24-hour exposure. Data are collected from at least 3 experiments. The level
of statistical significance is indicated for comparisons discussed in the text. (n.s., not significant). A, on cisplatin, asna-1;cep-1/p53 (n ¼ 41) is not more
resistant than asna-1 alone (n ¼ 46). Rather, asna-1;cep-1 is more sensitive (*, P < 0.05) but no significant difference is observed between cep-1 and wild type.
B, on cisplatin, asna-1;egl-1/BH3 (n ¼ 112) worms are not more resistant than asna-1 alone (n ¼ 186). C, wild-type worms (N2) and asna-1(ok938) mutants
were exposed to feeding RNAi to eliminate ced-3/caspase function. Control RNAi (L4440) was performed in parallel. On cisplatin agar, asna-1;ced-3(rnai)
worms (n ¼ 76) are not more resistant than asna-1 (n ¼ 32).

Table S1), excluding the possibility that increased oral intake
of cisplatin is the reason for hypersensitivity. Second, worms
were put on plates with cisplatin agar on 1 side and control
agar on the other. The relative number of worms on each side
was determined after 1 hour. Avoidance of cisplatin was
observed neither in wild-type nor in asna-1 mutants (Supplementary Table S2). Finally, when worms were exposed to
cisplatin in solution where avoidance is impossible, asna-1
mutants were again more sensitive to cisplatin than wild type
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Cisplatin can induce apoptosis and necrosis in tumor cells,
(3) and apoptosis is increased by downregulation of ASNA1 in
a human cell line (5). To test whether apoptosis is involved in
the cisplatin sensitivity of C. elegans asna-1 mutants, we
blocked the apoptosis signaling pathway and evaluated resistance. We created a double mutant between asna-1 and cep-1/
p53 and a double mutant between asna-1 and egl-1/BH-3-only
(which lacks all somatic apoptosis; ref. 34). Third, we exposed
asna-1 mutants to ced-3/caspase RNAi that was effective
because germline apoptosis was eliminated. asna-1 mutants
did not become more resistant when apoptosis was blocked by
depleting cep-1, egl-1, or ced-3 activity (Fig. 2A–C). The asna-1;
cep-1 double mutants were slightly more sensitive to cisplatin
compared with asna-1 single mutants (P < 0.05) but there was
no significant difference between cep-1 and wild type (P ¼
0.121; Fig. 2A). Observation of worms exposed to cisplatin
showed that both wild-type and asna-1 mutants had signs of
necrosis, most obviously in the head region (Supplementary
Fig. S5). We conclude that apoptosis is not involved in the
increased cisplatin sensitivity seen in adult asna-1 mutant
worms.
The prokaryotic ASNA-1 homologue ArsA contains 3 metalbinding residues (Cys113, Cys172, and His148; ref. 35) that
activate the ArsA ATPase after binding of arsenite or anti-

monite. We deleted the asna-1 codon for His164 that corresponds to His148 in ArsA. By Western blot analysis of several
transgenic lines expressing ASNA-1DH164:GFP, we identified a
line in which the ASNA-1DH164:GFP expression level was equal
to levels of wild-type ASNA-1 (Fig. 3A). The asna-1DH164:gfp
transgene rescued the growth phenotype of asna-1 mutants as
much as the wild-type transgene (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S6), showing that ASNA-1DH164:GFP is functional. However, these worms were still cisplatin sensitive (Fig. 3B),
identifying His164 as a target in ASNA-1 to increase cisplatin
sensitivity.
The ASNA-1 homologue in yeast (Get3) functions as a
homodimer, and His172 in Get3 (corresponding to ASNA-1
His164) is the transition site for alteration between 2 dimer
conformations important for targeting of TA-proteins (17).
The Get3 homodimer is linked by Cys285 and Cys288 from
each half of the dimer and when these residues are mutated,
Get3 is nonfunctional and unable to dimerize (17, 36). His172,
Cys285, and Cys288 are conserved between yeast, C. elegans,
and humans (Supplementary Fig. S7). We changed ASNA-1
Cys285 and Cys288 to serines and selected a transgenic
strain in which the ASNA-1C285S C288S:GFP expression
level was similar to that of wild-type ASNA-1 (Fig. 3A).
ASNA-1C285S C288S is functional because its expression
rescues the growth phenotype of asna-1 mutants (Fig. 3D;
Supplementary Fig. S6). However, worms expressing
ASNA-1C285S C288S were sensitive to cisplatin (Fig. 3C), identifying ASNA-1 Cys285 and Cys288 as another possible target for
metal drug sensitivity.
Rescue of the asna-1 growth phenotype by asna-1DH164 and
asna-1C285S C288S (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S6) indicates
that insulin signaling is restored by these transgenes. To
confirm this finding we performed the dauer escape assay.
Worms remain in the dauer stage permanently at 25 C if they

are mutant for daf-7/TGFb. A compensatory increase in
insulin pathway activity by overexpression of some insulins
or wild-type ASNA-1 allows daf-7 dauers to exit the
dauer stage and become adults (23). Using this assay we
observed that 23% of daf-7(e1372) dauers expressing the
asna-1C285S C288S transgene (n ¼ 103) and 26% of daf-7 dauers
expressing the asna-1DH164 transgene (n ¼ 105) exited the
dauer state at 25 C. Hence, these transgenes expressing
mutant forms of asna-1 are capable of enhancing insulin
signaling. This shows that the His164, Cys285, and Cys288
residues are essential for cisplatin resistance but not for
insulin signaling and that it should be possible to design
drugs that target ASNA-1–promoted cisplatin resistance without interfering with insulin signaling.
In C. elegans, mutants in both the insulin/insulin-like growth
factor receptor homologue daf-2 and asna-1 have greatly
decreased insulin signaling (23). To further test whether
ASNA-1–dependent chemoresistance is a consequence of the
influence of ASNA-1 on insulin signaling, we exposed
daf-2(e1370) mutants to cisplatin. Although asna-1 mutants
died on cisplatin plates, no death was scored in the daf-2
mutants (Fig. 4A), suggesting that reducing insulin signaling
by itself has no effect on cisplatin sensitivity. These results are
consistent with our data in Table1, where starved wild-type
larval controls, which lack insulin signaling (37), were more
resistant to cisplatin than asna-1(rnai)–treated larvae, which
also lack insulin signaling (23). In addition, daf-2 mutants are
resistant to copper (38) whereas asna-1 mutants are hypersensitive (Fig. 1C). Thus, depletion of ASNA-1 affects pathways
other than insulin signaling to cause metal salt hypersensitivity.
As another test of separability between the insulin and
cisplatin phenotype of ASNA-1, we expressed asna-1 under
tissue-specific promoters in asna-1 mutants. asna-1 expres-

sion under an intestinal (pelt-2) or an insulin (pdaf-28) promoter
rescued the resistance in a significant manner (Fig. 4B). The
insulin promoter (pdaf-28) and the asna-1 promoter drive
asna-1 expression in head neurons and in the intestine. The
intestine is considered the most important organ for detoxification in worms (39). Consistent with this notion, asna-1
expression only in head neurons (under the posm-6 promoter)
did not rescue the sensitivity of asna-1 mutants (Fig. 4C).
However, asna-1 expression in head neurons is sufficient to
rescue the insulin signaling defect in asna-1 mutants (23).
These observations reinforce the notion that the insulin function of ASNA-1 is distinct from its cisplatin-related function.

Discussion
Platinum-based chemotherapy is widely used and is increasingly important in the treatment of cancer. Despite 3 decades of
clinical use and intense research, there is still a need for greater
knowledge about cellular responses to platinum compounds.
Cisplatin is generally considered to be toxic through its interaction with DNA, but it also induces cell death through endoplasmic reticulum stress, independently of DNA damage (40). A
more detailed understanding of the mode of action by cisplatin
would increase the possibility to circumvent cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, recent clinicalstudieshave highlighted that
a targeted drug against EGFR has a detrimental effect on patient
survival when given together with platinum-based drugs in
patients with KRAS mutated tumors (41). This underscores
the importance of finding useful models to study interactions
among genetic factors, targeted drugs, and platinum-based
chemotherapy. This work presents a model for such studies.
We have identified ASNA-1 as a target to reduce cisplatin
resistance and characterized this in vivo using genetic

between C. elegans and cancer medicine and underscores
the importance of functional studies in vivo in addition to
structure biology.
Downregulation of mammalian ASNA1 results in retarded
growth, increased cisplatin sensitivity, increased apoptosis,
and decreased insulin signaling (5, 23). Studying ASNA-1 in C.
elegans made it possible to separate these phenotypes. Here
we show that asna-1–mutant cisplatin hypersensitivity is seen
even when insulin signaling and the growth phenotype are
rescued and also in absence of apoptosis. Cisplatin-resistant
tumor cells are often resistant to apoptosis signaling (2) but
according to these results, they could be resensitized to
cisplatin if the chemotherapy was combined with a targeted
therapy against ASNA1.
Cisplatin-resistant cells are cross-resistant to arsenite, antimonite, and copper (7, 8, 33). asna-1 mutants are hypersensitive to all these substrates but not to cadmium or zinc. Several
reports show that the copper transporters CTR1, ATP7A, and
ATP7B can mediate cisplatin influx and efflux (31, 32). asna-1
mutant hypersensitivity to copper indicates that ASNA-1
could regulate copper transporters to promote copper and
cisplatin resistance. We speculate that the conserved metalloregulated ATPase ASNA1 regulates diverse TA-proteins in
response to toxic metals in metazoans. Cisplatin resistance is
multifactorial and ASNA1 could be a unique target to interfere
with several resistance factors.
In conclusion, we demonstrate the validity of C. elegans as a
model to identify and characterize cisplatin response mechanisms and that a targeted therapy against ASNA1 could resensitize cisplatin-resistant cells and improve outcome for cancer
patients.

techniques in the nematode C. elegans. Molecular pathways
related to human diseases are highly conserved between
C. elegans and humans. The existing mutation libraries and
in vivo markers for cell damage provide useful tools to further
study cisplatin in C. elegans. This model can also be used for
chemical drug screens and functional genomic screens in vivo.
Recent efforts to describe the structure of the ASNA-1
homologue in yeast (Get3) have resulted in different models
for ASNA-1 targeting of TA-proteins. In the nematode, it has
been possible to use these data to study the function of
metazoan ASNA-1 in vivo. Although several reports identify
a pair of cysteins in ASNA-1 important for ASNA-1 dimerization and targeting of TA-proteins, we show that mutated
ASNA-1 lacking these cysteins is capable of promoting insulin
signaling but cannot rescue the cisplatin hypersensitivity
phenotype. A drug blocking these residues of ASNA-1 could
sensitize tumors to cisplatin while preserving other functions
of ASNA-1. This illustrates the translational possibilities
