Abstract

Author Manuscript

The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA) play diverse functional roles in cancer. In this study, we
show that upregulation of HOTAIR induced platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, and increased
HOTAIR levels were observed in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian tumors vs. primary ovarian
tumors. To investigate the role of HOTAIR during DNA damage induced by platinum, we
monitored double-strand breaks and show that HOTAIR expression results in sustained activation
of DNA damage response after platinum treatment. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of
HOTAIR induces NF-κB activation during DNA damage response and MMP-9 and IL-6
expression, both key NF-κB target genes. We show that HOTAIR regulates activation of NF-κB by

decreasing Iκ-Bα (NF-κB inhibitor) and establish that by inducing prolonged NF-κB activation
and expression of NF-κB target genes during DNA damage, HOTAIR plays a critical role in
cellular senescence and platinum sensitivity. Our findings suggest that a NF-κB-HOTAIR axis
drives a positive-feedback loop cascade during DNA damage response and contributes to cellular
senescence and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian and other cancers.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The mammalian DNA damage response (DDR) to genotoxic stress is critically important for
maintaining genome stability, cell survival and preventing cellular transformation. DDR
networks include the classic tumor suppressor gene p53 and its downstream target p21 [1].
More recently, a DDR mechanism has been reported involving nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), a master regulator of over 400 genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell cycle
control and cell senescence [2, 3]. NF-κB signaling-mediated activation of DDR has been
shown to restore genomic integrity, augment cancer cell survival, and play a role in
development of resistance to platinum-based cancer therapies [4, 5]. However, distinct DNA
damage-induced NF-κB signaling pathways contributing to chemoresistance in cancer have
not been well studied.

Platinum, the first line of therapy for ovarian and other cancers, induces inter-and-intra
strand crosslinks, generates single stranded breaks and activates nucleotide excision repair
[6]. Cellular responses to DNA damage, including response to platinum, can be regulated at
the post-transcriptional level by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [7] . The JADE1 adjacent
regulatory RNA (lncRNA-JADE) was reported to play a crucial role in DNA damageinduced, histone H4 acetylation associated with transcriptional activation [8], and lncRNAp21 was shown to physically interact with hnRNPK (heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear
proteins) during DDR and mediate p53-dependent transcriptional repression [9]. Platinuminduced DNA damage resulted in lncRNA PANDA (p21-associated ncRNA DNA damage
activated) activation, interaction with transcription factor NF-YA, and PANDA-NF-YA
modulation of p53-dependent apoptosis [10].

Author Manuscript

HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a lncRNA frequently overexpressed in human
cancers [11], was originally identified in 2007 by Rinn et al as a lncRNA located in the
HOXC cluster on chromosome 12 that regulates the HOXD gene cluster on chromosome 2
[12]. HOTAIR transcriptionally silences genes located on a distant chromosome region
through an epigenetic mechanism involving interaction with polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2) [7] . This interaction appears to be required for PRC2 occupancy of specific loci,
such as the HOXD locus, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine K27 (H3K27me3) by enhancer
of zeste 2 (EZH2) and subsequent gene repression [12, 13]. Additional inter-chromosomal
targets of HOTAIR include- cancer-associated genes such as protocadherin (PCDH), ephrin
receptor (EPHA1) and the NF-κB inhibitory protein Iκ-Bα [12, 14]. Although epigenetic
processes have been reported to play critical roles in DDR [15], including aberrant histone
methylation by EZH2 [16, 17], a direct role for HOTAIR in DDR has not been investigated.
However, functional overlap between PRC2 and NF-κB activation by genotoxic agents,
inflammation, and cancer has been reported [18], suggesting a potential interaction between

NF-κB activation and HOTAIR in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, in solid tumors,
including ovarian cancer (OC), enhanced NF-κB activation has been observed in aggressive
chemoresistant cell lines [19].

Results

Author Manuscript

The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role for HOTAIR in DDR and
chemotherapy resistance. We demonstrate a strong correlation of HOTAIR overexpression
with platinum resistance in OC cell lines and patient tumors. In response to DNA damage,
we found that NF-κB directly upregulates HOTAIR expression in OC cell lines.
Downregulation of Iκ-Bα during DDR induced a NF-κB-HOTAIR signaling positivefeedback loop cascade, and we demonstrate that DDR further induces HOTAIR-mediated
expression of p65-NF-κB and NF-κB target genes MMP9 and IL-6 to promote OC cellular
senescence and resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Collectively, these results are the first
to demonstrate a role for HOTAIR in DNA damage-induced NF-κB signaling pathway,
identifying HOTAIR as a new therapeutic target in drug resistant OC and likely other
cancers.

Overexpression of HOTAIR increases colony formation and CDDP resistance

HOTAIR is overexpressed in drug-resistant ovarian cancer
We examined expression of HOTAIR in a panel of OC cell lines (Fig. 1A) representing a
spectrum of platinum (CDDP) sensitivity (Resistant; Sensitive). Increased (P<0.05)
HOTAIR expression was observed in CDDP- resistant (IC50 levels >10µM) compared to sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Table S1) and in OC tumors obtained from
unpaired patients with CDDP-resistant vs. -sensitive high-grade serous disease (2.1 log2 fold
change; Fig. 1B). We then examined patient data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA; publically available expression and clinical annotation data) [20]. HOTAIR
expression was increased (>0.5 log10 fold-change) in OC patients with recurrent compared
to primary high-grade serous disease (Fig. 1C).

Author Manuscript

To further examine the association between HOTAIR expression and chemoresistance, we
either overexpressed (80-fold increase vs. control; Supplementary Fig. S1A) HOTAIR in
CDDP-sensitive A2780p or HEYC2 (moderate HOTAIR levels) or knocked-down (70%
reduction compared to dsiGFP control, Supplementary Fig. S1B) HOTAIR in CDDPresistant A2780_CR5 and examined functional changes using clonogenic and proliferation
assays in vitro and a mouse xenograft model in vivo. HOTAIR overexpression increased
(P<0.05) whereas HOTAIR knockdown decreased (P<0.05) OC clonogenic survival (Fig. 1D
and Supplementary Fig. S1C). However, overexpression or knockdown of HOTAIR had no
effect on cell doubling time (Supplementary Fig. S1D, E), indicating that cell proliferation
rate was not altered. To test whether HOTAIR overexpression contributed to CDDP
resistance in vivo, A2780p were transfected with either HOTAIR or vector control, treated
with CDDP or vehicle to induce DNA damage, and then injected subcutaneously in nude
mice (see Methods). Tumor size was measured biweekly. Tumor growth, measured by
assessing area under the curve (AUC) of the xenograft tumor, was greater (P<0.05) for
HOTAIR overexpressing OC tumors compared to control (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Fig.

and CDDP resistance.
HOTAIR mediates DNA damage response (DDR) in ovarian cancer cells

We observed that CDDP treatment of A2780p cells increased (P<0.05) HOTAIR expression
starting at 16 hr post treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and that HOTAIR expression was
also increased by other DNA damage agents mitomycin C and hydrogen peroxide (MMC
and H2O2; Supplementary Fig. S2B, C). To further examine a role for HOTAIR as a
potential mediator of DDR, we examined known cellular responses to genotoxic stress and
apoptosis [21] after platinum treatment, including phosphorylation of Chk1 (pChk1),
formation of γ-H2AX foci, and caspase cleavage. A2780p cells overexpressing HOTAIR or
A2780_CR5 cells transfected with dsiRNA HOTAIR were treated with CDDP. HOTAIR
overexpression increased s317 phosphorylation of Chk1, a marker for Chk1 activation, in
A2780p (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2D), whereas HOTAIR knockdown decreased
Chk1 s317 phosphorylation in A2780_CR5 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Interestingly, in the Kuramochi OC cell line harboring p53D281Y mutant (DNA binding
mutant), phosphorylation of both p53 and Chk1 was induced by HOTAIR overexpression
(Supplementary Fig. S2F). No expression of p21 was observed (data not shown), confirming
inactive p53 (Supplementary Table S1). pChk1 levels correlated with γ-H2AX
phosphorylation, and the percentage of cells containing >5 γ-H2AX foci increased (1.5 and
4 fold) by 1 and 24 hr of CDDP exposure in HOTAIR overexpressing A2780p cells (Fig.
2C) and decreased in A2780_CR5 cells (2.3 and 1.5 fold) by 1 and 24 hr (Fig. 2D). The
number of γ-H2AX foci was unchanged in untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2G).
Furthermore, enforced overexpression of HOTAIR in A2780p decreased caspase 3/7
cleavage (Fig. 2E; left) and increased caspase 3/7 cleavage in A2780_CR5 cells transfected
with dsiRNA HOTAIR (Fig. 2E; right), an established characteristic of cells undergoing
apoptosis, indicating that HOTAIR overexpression inhibited platinum-induced apoptosis.
Overexpression of HOTAIR leads to specific changes in gene expression

Author Manuscript

To investigate the association between HOTAIR, DDR and chemoresistance and identify
genes and pathways affected by HOTAIR overexpression, we performed whole
transcriptome RNA-sequencing of A2780p (CDDP-sensitive) and A2780_CR5 (CDDPresistant and endogenous HOTAIR overexpression) OC cell lines. Marked differences in
overall gene expression profiles were observed between the paired lines (Supplementary Fig.
S3A, B), and expression of DDR-associated genes (e.g., MLH1 and XRCC3), NF-κB
pathway (e.g., IL6R, IL4R, NCAM, BCL2L211) and epigenetic regulators (i.e., PRCassociated genes) were prominently altered in A2780_CR5 compared to A2780p
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). As expected, differential expression of cancer relevant cellular
processes and pathways associated with chemoresistance (anti-apoptotic, cell adhesion,
inflammation) in these cell lines was also observed, including the NF-κB pathway
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Further examination of the highly enriched NF-κB pathway by
western blot analysis confirmed that total p65 nuclear levels were increased (3.2-fold vs.
A2780p) in A2780_CR5 (Fig. 3A).

To validate NF-κB activation by HOTAIR, we measured Iκ-Bα levels in A2780p cells
overexpressing HOTAIR treated with CDDP (Fig. 3B). We observed Iκ-Bα protein levels
decreased indicating that by repressing the inhibitory Iκ-Bα unit, HOTAIR can activate NFκB during DDR. Next we measured nuclear p65-NF-κB expression in A2780p HOTAIR
overexpressing and A2780_CR5 dsiHOTAIR knockdown cells using immunofluorescence
(IF) and western blotting. We observed a 2-fold increase in NF-κB translocation 1 and 24 hr
post-CDDP treatment in A2780 cells (Fig. 3C), and an increase in nuclear p65 and decrease
in both nuclear and cytoplasmic Iκ-Bα in the western blot (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we
observed a 3 and 5 fold decrease in NF-κB translocation 1 and 24 hr post-CDDP treatment
in A2780_CR5 cells (Fig. 3E) and a decrease in nuclear p65 and increase in cytoplasmic IκBα levels with western blotting (Fig. 3F), indicating that HOTAIR expression promotes
sustained NF-κB activation during DDR.

To further investigate the role of NF-κB transcriptional activity in stress (genotoxic)-induced
HOTAIR expression (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B and C) A2780p cells were treated with
CDDP. As shown in Fig. 4A, an increase in HOTAIR expression was observed (9-fold) at 24
hr post-CDDP treatment and co-treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor (Bay-11) inhibited
(P<0.001) CDDP-induced HOTAIR expression. TNF-α treatment increased (P<0.05)
expression of HOTAIR (16-fold by 2 hr; Supplementary Fig. 4A) and ectopic overexpression
of two known inducers of NF-κB, IKK-α and IKK-β [22], increased (p<0.05) HOTAIR
expression (3-fold; Fig. 4B). Furthermore, in A2780p ectopically overexpressing HOTAIR,
NF-κB targets IL-6, and MMP9 were upregulated (P<0.05) while expression of these genes
was reduced (P<0.05) in HOTAIR knockdown-A2780_CR5 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, in
xenograft OC tumors overexpressing HOTAIR, CDDP treatment increased overall
expression of HOTAIR and NF-κB target genes, with IL-6 and MMP9 upregulation
(P<0.05) relative to tumors derived from untreated OC cells (Fig. 4D), confirming
functionality of the pathway in vivo and stable gene expression changes‥

Our findings that HOTAIR expression was increased hours post-DNA damage and this
induced expression was blocked by inhibition of NF-κB activation (Supplementary Fig. 2A)
indicated transcriptional regulation of the lncRNA in a NF-κB/DNA damage-dependent
manner. To begin to determine the underlying mechanism, we used promoter-binding assays
to examine the HOTAIR promoter region (1 kb upstream of transcription start site (TSS)).
We identified a putative p65-NF-κB binding site (906-GGGACACCCC-915) (Fig. 5A) and
investigated NF-κB-p65 binding to the HOTAIR promoter region in A2780_CR5 cells using
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with five different primer sets (1, 10kb; 2, 8kb, 3,
4kb; 4: 900 bp; 5, 200 bp from the TSS) spanning 10kb upstream of the TSS (Fig. 5B).
Enrichment (4-fold) of p65 in the canonical binding site (primers 4 & 5) was observed
compared to control primer 1 (Fig. 5B), further supporting a regulatory role for NF-κB
pathway in HOTAIR expression. Next, we measured p65-NF-κB binding to the HOTAIR
promoter in A2780p cells treated with CDDP in the presence and absence of Bay-11.
Enrichment (5.2 fold) of p65 in the canonical binding site 4 was observed compared to
control primer (Fig. 5C) and abolished in the presence of Bay-11.
To further examine the transcriptional activation of HOTAIR by p65-NF-κB, transient
transfection assays were performed in 293 cells using wild-type or mutant (906-

in Supplementary Fig. S4B, treatment with TNF-α increased (p<0.05) luciferase activity
(1.6-fold) by the p65-NF-κB wild-type vector, no change in activity of the mutant promoter
was observed, and TNF-α-induced luciferase activity was blocked (P<0.05) by NF-κB
inhibitor Bay-11.
Regulation of HOTAIR expression by NF-κB during DDR

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of additional DNA damaging agents on NF-κB activation, we used a
previously reported luciferase reporter construct containing 861 base pairs of the E-selectin
promoter containing 3 canonical NF-κB-p65-binding sites as a positive control [23]. TNF-α
treatment increased luciferase activity compared to empty vector (Supplementary Fig. S4C),
confirming luciferase activation by known NF-κB inducers. In cells treated with MMC,
H2O2 or CDDP, we observed increased luciferase activity, suggesting that various types of
DNA damage can activate NF-κB (Supplementary Fig. S4D). To determine NF-kB specific
transcription luciferase activity was determined in p65-wt or -mutant vector transfected
A2780p cells (described in Supplementary Fig. S4D) treated with MMC, H2O2 or CDDP. As
shown in Fig. 5D, p65-wt HOTAIR promoter activity was increased by these genotoxic
agents (6.9-, 8.2- and 5.0-fold by MMC, CDDP, or H2O2 relative to empty vector
respectively) and was inhibited (P<0.05) by pretreatment with Bay-11 (Fig. 5E). No change
in luciferase activity was observed with the p65-mutant construct relative to wild-type vector
(Fig. 5D, E). In all, our results suggest that HOTAIR is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB
as a response to DNA damage.
Overexpression of HOTAIR induces IL-6 secretion, DDR activation and cellular senescence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cytokines in the microenvironment contribute to DNA damage resistance [24] and secretion
of cytokines during persistent DNA damage has been reported [25]. IL-6 secretion in
particular was shown to contribute to a “chemoresistant niche” [26]. Having observed
significant expression of interleukin receptors in A2780_CR5 (Fig. 3B), indicative of
pathway activation, we performed an NF-κB target cytokine screen. HOTAIR
overexpression was associated with increased (>2-fold) secretion of CCL5, IL-5, IL-6,
CXCL-11 and IL-23 compared to vector control (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Moreover,
treatment of A2780p cells with “HOTAIR-conditioned” media increased (P<0.05) CDDP
IC50 by >2-fold, which was reversed using an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (Fig. 6A). The
addition of recombinant IL-6 to unconditioned media resulted in an approximate 2-fold
increase (P<0.05) in the IC50 for CDDP (Fig. 6B), and dsiRNA knockdown of HOTAIR in
A2780_CR5 cells reduced (P<0.05) IL-6 secretion (Fig. 6C) and IC50 for CDDP (Fig. 6D).
Recombinant IL-5 had no effect on CDDP IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S5B), further
indicating a role for HOTAIR-mediated IL-6 induction in platinum-DNA damage response.
Based on a recent report that unresolved DNA strand breaks (DSBs) caused by DNA
damage followed by NF-κB activation and IL-6 secretion can induce cellular senescence
[25], we examined whether treatment with low (1µM CDDP or 1/10th of IC50) or high
(20µM CDDP or 2X the IC50) doses of CDDP induce senescence in A2780p cells
overexpressing HOTAIR or not. Activation of p53 and p21 by HOTAIR was observed only
during high CDDP treatment, indicated by p53 phosphorylation and p21 expression (Fig.

6E). In addition, IL-6 secretion, an established marker for cell senescence [25, 27], was
increased (P<0.05) by CDDP in A2780p overexpressing HOTAIR compared to vector
transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Based on the observation that addition of
recombinant IL-6 increased (P<0.05) proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5D), we reasoned
that IL-6 secretion by senescent cells induced proliferation of neighboring cells.

Author Manuscript

We then investigated whether increase in p-Chk1 and p-p53 was dependent on ATR
signaling (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR) signaling pathway)
[28]. In HOTAIR overexpressing vs. vector control cells, decreased p-p53 levels (Fig. 7A,
left) was observed and the level of p-Chk1 was essentially unchanged (Fig. 7A, right),
suggesting ATR-dependent activation of p53 by HOTAIR (further supported by no change in
proliferation in the presence of ATRi; Supplementary Fig. S5E). Next, we measured p-Chk1
and p-p53 levels in A2780_CR5 cells upon dsiRNA knockdown HOTAIR and observed
decreased p-Chk1 and p-p53 levels overall, and this effect was abolished in the presence of
ATR inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S5F). To examine lack of p65-NF-kB on cell
proliferation and CDDP-resistance, we stably knocked down p65-NF-kB and validated
reduced luciferase activity after stimulation with TNF-α (Supplementary Fig. S6A, B).
Interestingly, ectopic expression of HOTAIR in NF-κB knockdown cells rescued (P<0.05)
proliferation and increased (P<0.05) clonogenic survival (Supplementary Fig. S6C, D),
which may be attributed to the previously described role of HOTAIR in inhibiting p21 as a
potential mechanism of chemotherapy resistance and evasion of apoptosis [29, 30].

Author Manuscript

To examine cellular senescence, we measured β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-Gal) [31]. In
HOTAIR overexpressing A2780p cells, SA-β-Gal positive cell numbers were increased
(P<0.05) by high vs. low levels of CDDP (Supplementary Fig. S7A), and NF-κB inhibitor
Bay-11 reduced (P<0.05) the number of senescent cells (Fig. 7B), which is likely a
cytostatic effect of the drug (and not cytotoxicity), based on the observation that ectopic
expression of HOTAIR increased cell proliferation in cells treated with the NF-κB inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). DsiRNA knockdown of HOTAIR in A2780_CR5 cells reduced
the number of senescent cells (Fig. 7C). Next, we performed flow cytometry in both
HOTAIR expressing A2780p and dsiHOTAIR knockdown A2780_CR5 cells 24 and 48 hr
post CDDP treatment. We observe a decrease in S1 and an increase in G2 phase 48 hr post
CDDP treatment in HOTAIR expressing cells (Fig. 7D) and a reversal of this effect in
A2780_CR5 cells (Fig. 7E) suggesting that a subpopulation of cells undergo HOTAIRdependent cell senescence. Collectively, these results indicate that HOTAIR-induced NF-κB
activation and IL-6 secretion contributes to a senescent phenotype, and IL-6 secretion
influences the surrounding cell population in a paracrine manner, contributing to
chemoresistance (Supplementary Fig. S7C).

Discussion
HOTAIR is a lncRNA frequently overexpressed in solid tumors [32] and associated with
cancer cell growth and migration. Although HOTAIR overexpression in OC correlates with
disease metastasis and poor patient prognosis [12, 33, 34], the underlying mechanism of
HOTAIR upregulation and the role of this important lncRNA in drug resistance in OC and
other cancers is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate a key role for HOTAIR

in DNA damage: HOTAIR modulates expression of genes activated during DDR, including
Chk1 and the levels of γ-H2AX, to inhibit cell cycle progression. Our findings include that
HOTAIR activation of the NF-κB pathway following CDDP-induced DNA damage
contributes to cellular senescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DDR activation of NFκB induces HOTAIR and a positive feedback loop, resulting in sustained NF-κB activation
and persistent DNA damage signaling. As platinum-based regimens continue to be the
mainstay of treatment for many solid cancers including OC [35], HOTAIR may represent a
target for therapeutic intervention of drug resistance.

Previous mapping studies revealed HOTAIR binding to chromosomal regions near the IκBα gene, supporting the potential regulation of NF-κB activity by HOTAIR. NF-κB is a
master regulator of several cellular responses, including DDR, stress, senescence and
inflammation, although its role in cancer is paradoxical, including both oncogenic and tumor
suppressive activities [36]. In ovarian and other cancers, NF-κB activation is associated with
chemoresistance [37, 38] and activation during DNA damage induced by genotoxic agents
has been demonstrated but not well defined [4, 5]. We show that HOTAIR expression
modulated NF-κB activation as well as multiple NF-κB target genes including IL-6 and
MMP-9 in vitro as well as in vivo. Consistent with these results, overexpression of HOTAIR
increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which correlated with reduced total Iκ-Bα levels
after CDDP treatment, and HOTAIR overexpression resulted in sustained DDR and NF-κB
activation.

Our results also link HOTAIR-mediated IL-6 secretion with platinum resistance (Fig. 6A).
The IL-6 cytokine induces apoptosis inhibitors BCL-2, BCL-XL and XIAP and contributes
to CDDP-resistance [39]. Importantly, IL-6 secretion has also been linked with exposure to
genotoxic stress caused by cisplatin and carboplatin [40]. IL-6 is generally considered a prosurvival cytokine, but sustained IL-6 secretion after DNA damage is linked with cellular
senescence [36]. The notion of cell senescence (a tumor suppressor mechanism) contributing
to chemotherapy resistance (involves cell proliferation) is an emerging concept. Recent
reports suggest that a senescent cell can become a “pro-inflammatory cell” and promote
tumor progression by acquiring a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) offer
support for this concept [41, 42]. Our findings that HOTAIR can activate NF-kB and its
target genes is supported by a recent report implicating HOTAIR in driving the expression of
genes directly involved in SASP in urothelial carcinoma, further potentiating an important
role for HOTAIR during senescence [43]. Furthermore, it is now strongly believed that the
secretion of IL-6 by senescent cells can alter the tumor microenvironment in a paracrine
fashion, activating multiple pathways, including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [44], and transforming surrounding stromal cells to a more chemoresistant phenotype
[25, 26] (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Our findings on HOTAIR, IL-6, and DNA damageinduced cell senescence are consistent with previous reports associating HOTAIR expression
with EMT [33, 34], suggesting promotion of EMT by HOTAIR during chemotherapyinduced DNA damage may contribute to chemoresistance. The slow tumor growth we
observed in CDDP-treated HOTAIR expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S1F) could be
attributed to senescent cells altering the microenvironment to a tumor promoting
environment, although further studies are needed.

Unresolved DSBs generated by prolonged CDDP-induced DNA damage can result in
constitutive activation of DDR signaling and activation of stress response pathways,
including senescence [45]. Senescence following irreparable DNA damage has been
reported [25], and we investigated whether exposure to low or high dose CDDP would be
analogous to early response (transient period) or development of resistance (prolonged
period). We demonstrate that prolonged expression of HOTAIR results in γ-H2AX foci
formation and subsequent activation of Chk1, which plays a pivotal role during DDR by
inducing S15 phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 (trans activation domain). The
finding that HOTAIR-induced p53 phosphorylation during high CDDP (prolonged exposure)
is further supported by the observed induction of p21 (Fig. 6D), a p53 target gene and CDK
inhibitor, a process that is ATR-dependent (Supplementary Fig.S7B). As induction of p21
has been closely linked to senescence [46], our findings are the first to indicate a role for
HOTAIR in both senescence and chemoresistance. In support of our data, HOTAIR has
recently been shown to induce the senescence pathway by its induction of p21 and p15 as
well as genes involved in the NF-kB pathway [43, 47]. We posit that HOTAIR can contribute
to the activation of several pathways that ultimately lead to chemoresistance. In high DNA
damaging conditions a subset of cells can undergo HOTAIR dependent senescence, and at
lower or non-senescent conditions HOTAIR can cause resistance in a cell-autonomous
manner.

In addition to demonstrating that the above scenario is a NF-κB pathway dependent process,
our results indicate that sustained NF-κB activation in HOTAIR expressing cells is due to
suppression of Iκ-Bα expression by HOTAIR, in agreement with a previous report linking
NF-κB activation to cellular senescence [2]. Recent studies show prolonged NF-κB
activation in mutant p53 cells increases inflammation and tumorigenesis, primarily by
mutant p53 sequestering tumor suppressor DAB2IP in the cytoplasm [48, 49]. Our
observation that HOTAIR induced phosphorylation of mutant p53 (Supplementary Fig. S2C)
may provide a mechanistic link for this complex process and support a role for HOTAIR in
tumorigenesis in p53 mutant OC, the most commonly mutated gene in the high-grade serous
disease [20]. In addition, it is possible that DNA damage can induce a physical interaction
between NF-κB and PRC2, which can alter regulation of genes involved during senescence,
such as an EZH2-NF-κB interaction [18].

Author Manuscript

Collectively, our data suggest a model (Fig. S7B) of NF-κB-driven transcription of
HOTAIR, which subsequently activates persistent NF-κB expression, IL-6 secretion, and
activation of CHK1-p53-p21 pathway, and establishment of a senescence, chemoresistant
cancer phenotype. Although the involvement of other NF-κB and HOTAIR target genes in
development of chemoresistance cannot be overlooked, the components of this network,
including HOTAIR, may represent targets for novel therapeutic strategies to overcome or
prevent CDDP-resistance in ovarian and other cancers.

described previously [50]. Cisplatin-resistant A2780_CR5 was established by continuous
exposure to increasing concentrations of cisplatin [50]. Cell lines were authenticated in 2012
by ATCC and tested for mycoplasma contamination (Manassas, VA). High-grade serous
ovarian tumors (unpaired samples; chemo-naïve, stage 3–4 or recurrent, platinum resistant),
and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) were surgically collected with informed consent from
all subjects (IRB approved protocol IUCRO-0280), snap-frozen, and stored in liquid
nitrogen [51]. Cisplatin (CDDP) was purchased from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA),
mitomycin C (MMC) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis MO), and H2O2
was purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). NF-κB inhibitor Bay-11–7082 was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). LZRS-HOTAIR was a gift from Dr.
Howard Chang (Stanford University; Addgene plasmid # 26110). Full-length HOTAIR was
cloned into pAV5S vector containing a 98-mer aptamer sequence and as a vector control,
aptamer cloned into pAV5S was used to account for any possible RNA-dependent signaling
effects [52].
Luciferase assays, DNA damage experiments

Author Manuscript

A2780p cells were seeded in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) and transfected with pGL3promHOTAIR or mutants (500 ng construct/transfection). To normalize transfection
efficiency, cells were co-transfected with PGL4 Renilla plasmid (100 ng). Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were treated with Bay-11–7082 (5ng/mL for 1h) and then TNF-α
(10ng/mL), MMC (10µM), CDDP (10µM) or H2O2 (10µM) for indicated times and lysed.
Luciferase activity was analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, Madison, WI) and a Thermo Scientific Multilabel Plate Reader. To induce DNA
damage, cells were treated with CDDP, MMC, H2O2 at indicated concentrations and
harvested for RNA and protein isolation at the stated time points. Caspase 3/7 cleavage
assay was performed according to manufacturers protocol (Caspase 3/7 GloAssay,
Promega).
Mutagenesis and RNAi

Site directed mutagenesis was performed with the following forward and reverse primer sets
using the QuickChange protocol by Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). Forward primer 5’GTGGTTTATCTTGCACCCCTCATTCTCAAGCCCCAGCCAGGGAA-3’, and reverse
primer 5’-TTCCCTGGCTGGGGCTTGAGAATGAGGGGTGCAAGATAAACCAC-3’. The
dsiRNA sequences used targeting human HOTAIR (Sense strand 5’UUCUAAAUCCGUUCCAUUCCACUGCGA-3’, and antisense strand 5’-/5Phos/
GCAGUGGAAUGGAACGGAUUUAGAA-3’) or negative control RNA targeting GFP
(Sense strand 5’-CUACAACAGCCACAACGUC-3’, and antisense strand 5’-/5Phos/
GACGUUGUGGCUGUUGUAG-3’). DsiRNAs were transfected into cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). shRNA for p65 and control were purchased from Santa
Cruz (Sc-29410-SH, and sc-108060). 48 hr post transfection, A2780p cells were selected
with 2.5ng/µL puromycin for 5 days and then maintained in 1ng/µL of the drug.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors

(Sigma). Protein (approximately 5–10 µg) was loaded on precast 7.5% TGX gels (BioRad,
Hercules, CA), blotting was performed as described previously [53] using polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare, Pittsburg, PA). Membranes were blocked,
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (EZH2, p21, p53, phospho-p53 (S15), βtubulin, Chk1, phospho-Chk1 (S317), Iκ-Bα, phospho-H2A.X, or Lamin-B (See
Supplementary Table S2), washed, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and protein signals were
observed using a chemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific, Schaumberg, IL),
according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.
MTT Assay

Author Manuscript

The quantity of viable cells was calculated by MTT assay as described previously [53].
Absorbance (570 nm; filter reference at 620 nm) was recorded using EnVision Multilabel
Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Doubling time was measured with the equation:
duration*log(2)/(log(final concentration)-log(initial concentration)).
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
RNA was extracted from cell lines and tumors and using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Venlo,
Limburg), cDNA was prepared using MMLV RT system (Promega), and qPCR) was
performed with total cDNA and primers for indicated genes and GAPDH or EEF1A as the
endogenous control (Supplementary Table S3), using Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast RTPCR system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and corresponding software, as we have
described [54].
Cytoplasmic and nuclear extractions

Author Manuscript

Cells were grown to 80% confluence, trypsinized and centrifuged (1200 RPM, 5 min). Cell
pellets were washed (1x PBS), re-pelleted (1200 RPM, 5 min), and then lysed in
cytoplasmic lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7,
150mM NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40; 10 min, 4°C). The lysate was pelleted (1200
RPM, 5 min), the supernatant was used for cytoplasmic buffer, and the remaining pellet was
washed (3 times with cytoplasmic lysis buffer, 10 min). After the final wash, the cell pellet
was lysed with nuclear lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7, 150mM NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2,
0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40), the lysate was pelleted (13,000 RPM,
10 min) and the supernatant was used for the nuclear fraction.
Clonogenic survival assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded (3–5 × 105 cells/well) and then transfected with expression vectors for
HOTAIR or vector alone (10µg) 24 hrs after seeding using Turbofect (Thermo). At 24 hr
post-transfection, cells were treated with CDDP for 3 hrs, washed, serially diluted, plated in
triplicate into 6 well plates, allowed 6–8 days of cell growth for colony formation, stained
with 5% crystal violet, and cell count was normalized to untreated control as described [54].

Mouse xenograft experiments

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All animal studies adhered to ethical regulations and protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana University. To assess tumorigenicity of cells
overexpressing HOTAIR, A2780p cells were transfected with pAV5S–HOTAIR or pAV5S–
aptamer and 24 hr post-transfection cells were treated or not with CDDP for 3 hr, washed
with PBS trypsinized and counted with trypan blue, re-suspended in 1:1 PBS/matrigel (BD
Bioscience) and injected subcutaneously into the left flank of 3- to 4- week-old female nude
athymic mice (BALB/ c-nu/nu; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), as described [54, 55]. Engrafted
mice (4 per group) were inspected three times per week for tumor appearance by visual
observation and palpation. Tumor length (l) and width (w) were measured weekly using
digital calipers and tumor volume (v) was calculated as v=½ × l × w2. No randomization
was used and no animals were excluded from the final data. The investigator measuring
tumor size was blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were sacrificed when tumor diameter
reached 2 cm or at the end of study.
ELISA and cytokine release assays
Conditioned media were prepared by washing culture plates with PBS followed by
incubation in serum-free RPMI medium with antibiotics for 48 hr and stored at −80°C. Total
cell counts were determined and ELISA was performed using kits and procedures from
R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN. Cytokine release assay, Cat #ARY005) and eBiosciences
(San Diego, CA. IL-6 ELISA Cat # 88-7066-22). The data were normalized to the cell
number and reported as fold change. IL-6 release assay was performed 3 times and the
cytokine release assay was performed once.
Immunofluorescence quantification

Author Manuscript

A2780p cells transfected with HOTAIR expression plasmid or vector control were plated on
glass slides (50,000 cells/well), incubated overnight 4°C with anti-phospho-H2AX or antip65 antibodies (See Supplementary Table S2), and the number of cells displaying nuclear
p65 or γ-H2AX was determined in ten random images from 3 independent experiments
using a light microscope (60X magnification). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using
image J software. To determine the difference in intensity, whole cell individual intensities
and the nuclear intensity were measured, intensities were averaged and normalized to
control to determine fold translocation
ChIP assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were cross-linked (1% formaldehyde) and dynabeads (Life Technologies) coupled to
the appropriate secondary antibody were used to immunoprecipitate sheared chromatin
extracts treated with anti-p65. After reversing the crosslinks, DNA was purified, and
standard curve of ChIP input DNA was prepared. Enrichment was calculated by using qPCR
to compare the level of the target region in each sample to the mean of negative control
genomic regions. Primers designed for the specified genomic regions (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) amplified a single product from input DNA based on a
single melting peak (Supplementary Table S4). Each ChIP DNA sample was assayed for the
levels of negative control regions.

Senescence-detection assays

Author Manuscript

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase was detected in A2780p cells fixed with 5%
formaldehyde and incubated in staining solution (Sigma) and 1mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl β-d-galactosidase (X-Gal, Invitrogen), for 24 hr at 37 °C cells, following the protocol
of Debacq-Chainiaux [31]. The number of distinct blue cells were counted (20X
magnification) and normalized to the total number of cells.
RNA-sequencing analysis of A2780p and A2780_CR5 cells

Author Manuscript

Stranded whole transcriptome RNA-seq was performed essentially as we have described
[56]. Briefly, biological duplicates of A2780p and A2780_CR5 cells (107 culture dish) were
lysed and RNA was extracted according to manufacturers protocol (Qiagen RNeasy Mini
kit). Total RNA was size fractionated by size using ethanol concentration manipulations.
The large RNA fraction (>200 nt) was fragmented prior to library construction. Ribosomal
RNA was reduced by duplex specific nuclease (DSN) following limited hybridizations of
both fractions and then amplified to add barcodes for multiplexing on the Illumina
HiSeq2000 platform. Demultiplexing was performed by CASAVA v1.8.2 and trimming was
accomplished with Trimmomatic v0.22 with additional trimming by fastx_clipper v0.0.13.2.
Read mapping was performed by tophat2 v2.0.6 to the human genome hg19 (UCSC) with
Gencode annotation v13 allowing no more than two mismatches. RNA sequencing data can
be accessed using SRA number SRP066008.
TCGA Analysis

Author Manuscript

The IlluminaHiSeq RNASeq data was provided by the Genome Sciences Centre, BCCA.
The RPKM values were provided from TCGA database. The exon-exon junction sequences
and their corresponding coordinates were defined based on annotations of any transcripts in
UCSC known genes, Ensembl (v54) or the Refseq database (as downloaded from the UCSC
genome browser on March 2009).
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean values ± SD of at least three biological experiments unless
otherwise indicated. CDDP IC50 values were determined by Prism 6 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA), using logarithm normalized sigmoidal dose curve fitting. The estimate
variation within each group were similar therefore student’s t-test was used to statistically
analyze the significant difference among different groups by using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad
Software). The genome-wide analysis experiments were conducted as described
previously[56, 57] using the Partek Genomics Suite (version 6.5).
