ABSTRACT
The interaction between acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML) with the bone
marrow stroma cells (BMSCs) determines a protective environment that favors
tumor development and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We showed that
BMSCs secrete soluble factors that protect AML cells from Ara-C induced cytotoxicity.
This leukemia chemoresistance is associated with a decrease in the equilibrative
nucleoside transporter (ENT1) activity by inducing removal of ENT1 from the cell
surface. Reduction of cell proliferation was also observed with activation of AKT and
mTOR-dependent cell survival pathways, which may also contribute to the tumor
chemoprotection. Analysis of primary BMSC cultures has demonstrated that AML
patients with stroma capable to confer Ara-C resistance in vitro compared to AML
patients without this stroma capacity were associated with a worse prognosis. The
two year overall survival rate was 0% versus 80% respectively (p=0.0001). This
is the first report of a chemoprotection mechanism based on the removal of a drug
transporter from the cell surface and most importantly the first time that a stroma
phenotype has correlated with prognostic outcome in cancer.

Development of resistance to chemotherapy remains a
significant problem following conventional chemotherapy
treatment when residual disease in the BM relapses into
a more resistant leukemia [1]. The most effective agent
for the treatment of AML is cytarabine (Ara-C), which is
the cornerstone of all standard chemotherapy regiments
[2]. Ara-C is a nucleoside analogue which functions by
inhibiting DNA synthesis. It is incorporated into cancer

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group
of neoplastic disorders characterized by the clonal
accumulation of immature myeloblasts in the bone marrow
(BM) and peripheral blood (PB). The treatment of AML
has improved substantially over the past few decades,
although the prognosis continues to be relatively poor.

cells using specialized membrane transport proteins [3],
the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1)
responsible for 80% of Ara-C uptake in human leukemia
cells [4].
The tumor microenvironment, in particular the
interaction of leukemia cells with the bone marrow
stromal cells (BMSCs), is known to be critical for both
cancer development and drug resistance [5, 6]. BMSCs
are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells originating from
the mesodermal germ layer that gives rise to stromal
cells including fibroblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes
and myocytes. All these cell types play a critical role
in the regulation of human stem cell maintenance and
localization. Recent studies have demonstrated that
these ‘BM niches’ stimulate stem cell proliferation,
self-renewal, differentiation and trafficking in and out
of the BM. BMSCs support both normal and malignant
hematopoiesis and produce a wide variety of soluble
signals, including cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors that activate normal hematopoietic and leukemia
precursors. The interaction of leukemia cells with BMSCs
contributes to the development of chemotherapy resistance
in vitro and in vivo [5].
We previously reported that mobilization of
leukemia cells away from the BM niche into the PB
induced by CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100, increased
significantly the overall survival of mice treated with
Ara-C [7]. This was likely to be due to the removal
of the leukemia cells from the stromal-cell derived
chemoprotection. We have also demonstrated that BMSCs
provided specific preferential protection to murine
leukemia cells from Ara-C induced apoptosis in vitro. It is
also known that BMSC-induced chemoprotection involves
production of soluble factors by the BM stroma which
inhibits ENT1 activity [7, 8]. In this study we extended
our previous observations to human BMSCs and addressed

the potential mechanisms and the prognostic value of the
chemoprotection induced by BMSCs from AML patients
to the leukemia cells treated with Ara-C.

RESULTS
Human bone marrow stromal cell supernatant
protects leukemia cell lines from Ara-C induced
cytotoxicity
We have previously shown that murine BMSCs
supernatant (SN) (from a cell line and primary cells)
contains soluble factors that protect murine leukemia
cells from Ara-C induced cytotoxicity in vitro. We also
demonstrated that in vivo administration of CXCR4
antagonist, AMD3100, and Ara-C significantly prolonged
survival of leukemic mice compared to mice treated with
Ara-C alone [7, 8]. These initial findings highlighted
the important role of the BM niche in leukemia
chemoresistance.
In order to test whether SN from human BMSCs
could modify the chemosensitivity of leukemia cells,
human leukemia cells lines THP1 and U937 were cultured
with or without human BMSC SN from HS5, primary
BMSC SN from AML patients or primary BMSC SN from
healthy donors. Cells were incubated with Ara-C for 24
hours and cell viability measured using the MTT assay.
Figure 1A and 1B demonstrate that both human AML cell
lines were significantly chemoprotected by BM SN from
HS5 and AML patients from Ara-C induced cytotoxicity,
whereas neither BM SN from a healthy volunteer, or
normal medium (RPMI) conferred chemoresistance. These
data demonstrate that also primary BMSCs from AML
patients secrete soluble factors that protect leukemia cells
from Ara-C treatment.

Human bone marrow stromal cells supernatant

Ara-C induced cytotoxicity

demonstrating HS5 SN mediated chemoprotection (Figure
2C). Furthermore, as observed in Figure 2D, Ara-C
patient leukemia sensitivity for both groups (RPMI and
HS5 SN) showed no significant difference in the clinical
outcome for patients with long-term remission versus
patients with treatment failure. There was no evidence
that the variation of Ara-C sensitivity of primary leukemia
cells was a prognostic survival factor for patients with
AML. Overall, we found that neither the in vitro primary
leukemia Ara-C sensitivity (IC50), nor the magnitude of the
leukemia resistance, correlated with any clinical outcome
investigated (remission induction, relapse, or overall
survival (data not shown)).

To investigate whether human BMSCs could also
confer Ara-C resistance to human primary leukemia, cells
from newly diagnosed AML patients were collected and
purified. These primary leukemia cells were incubated
with or without human BMSC SN from HS5, or primary
BMSC SN from AML patients. Patient samples were
incubated with Ara-C for 72 hours before cell viability
was measured by the MTT assay. Figure 2A and 2B
show data from 2 newly diagnosed representative AML
patients. Primary human leukemia cells from both
patients were significantly chemoprotected by human
BMSC SN from HS5 and primary BMSC SN from AML
patients from the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C. Combined
data from n=20 AML patients (each patient leukemia
cells were tested for Ara-C sensitivity with HS5 SN)
showed that Ara-C IC50 values were significantly higher
in primary leukemia cells cultured with HS5 SN compared
with leukemia cells cultured in normal medium (RPMI),

evaluate if the stroma capacity to confer resistance could
be affected after an effective induction treatment with
Ara-C based chemotherapy (complete remission; less
than 5% leukemia blasts at 30 days post chemotherapy
treatment, following complete hematopoiesis recovery).
THP1 cells and human primary leukemia cells were
incubated with or without human BMSCs SN from AML
patients at diagnosis or remission. Both cultures from
the same patients were incubated with Ara-C for 24 or
72 hours respectively and cell viability measured using
the MTT assay. Figure 3A and 3B shows that THP1 cells
and primary human leukemia cells were significantly
protected by both AML BMSC SNs (at diagnosis and
remission) from the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C. These
results demonstrated that chemotherapy treatment has no
effect on the BMSCs capacity to protect leukemia cells.

as effectively from Ara-C toxicity by HS5 SN diluted
1:1000, as they were by neat HS5 SN. Figure 4B, showed
THP1 chemoprotection from Ara-C by primary BMSCs
SN was effective when used neat or diluted 1:10, 1:50
and 1:100.

Bone marrow stromal cell supernatant
composition
In addition to soluble proteins, cells also release
membrane vesicles in the extracellular environment for
intercellular communication [10]. To evaluate whether
secreted extracellular vesicles contribute to drug resistance
of leukemia cells, three SN fractions were prepared by
differential centrifugation of freshly prepared HS5 SN;
microvesicles (P10), exosomes (P100) and mainly soluble
proteins (S100). THP1 cells were incubated for 2 hours
with these fractions obtained from the HS5 stroma cell
line before treatment with Ara-C for 24 hours. In contrast
to the chemoprotection provided by both HS5 SN and the
fraction containing soluble proteins (such as cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors), neither microvesicles nor
exosomes fractions had a significant effect (Figure 4C).
These data indicate that soluble factors rather than vesicles
secreted by BMSCs account for leukemia resistance
against Ara-C toxicity.

Investigating the mechanism of leukemia cell
protection from Ara-C induced by BMSCs
Bone marrow stromal cell supernatant potency
Several reports have shown that BMSCs secrete
a wide variety of soluble factors that protect leukemia
cells from the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C [7-9]. In order
to investigate the potency of this chemoprotective effect,
survival assays from serial dilutions were performed.
THP1 cells were cultured with or without human BMSC
SN from HS5 neat or diluted (BM SN HS5 1:50, 1:100
and 1:1000), with or without primary human BMSC
SN from an AML patient neat or diluted (BM SN AML
1:10, 1:50 and 1:100). Cells were incubated with Ara-C
for 24 hours and cell viability was measured by the MTT

whether ENT1 is a key player for Ara-C chemoprotection
observed when leukemia cells are incubated with HS5
SN, THP1 cells were incubated with human BMSC
SN from HS5 in the presence or absence of a selective
ENT1 small molecule inhibitor, Nitrobenzylthioinosine
(NBMPR). NBMPR (1μM) was added 2 hours before
treatment with Ara-C for 24 hours. Cell viability was
measured using the MTT assay. Figure 4D shows that
inhibition of ENT1 transporter by NBMPR conferred a
significant chemoprotection to Ara-C when administered
in the absence of HS5 SN. These data suggest that soluble
factor(s) derived from BMSCs may inhibit ENT1 activity
resulting in resistance of leukemia cells to the cytotoxic
effects of Ara-C associated with a reduced intracellular
incorporation.

was investigated. THP1 cells were cultured with or without
human BMSC SN from HS5 (BM SN HS5), stained with
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 7-aminoactinomycin
D (7-AAD) in order to analyze the cell cycle using flow
cytometry. HS5 SN caused a significant accumulation of
THP1 cells in G0/G1 phase (cell cycle arrest), decreased
the fraction of proliferating (S-phase) and G2/M cell
division phase of THP1 cells (Figure 5A). The increased
proportion of cells in G0/G1 indicates a cell cycle arrest.
These results highlight the role of the BMSCs in the
induction of quiescence in leukemia cells within the
BM microenvironment, which might contribute to
chemoprotection from cell-cycle dependent cytotoxic
agents such as Ara-C.

BMSC SN from HS5 had increased levels of total
mTOR and AKT proteins compared with cells incubated
in normal growth media (Figure 5B). The activation
(phosphorylation) of mTOR and AKT was also explored
in THP1 cells incubated with normal growth medium
(M) BM SN from HS5 (HS5) or primary BMSC SN
from AML patients (Patients P1-P4). BMSC SNs from
patients P1 and P4 have a “protective” phenotype (stroma
cells from AML patients that confer chemoresistance to
Ara-C) whereas P2 and P3 SNs have a “non-protective”
phenotype. THP1 cells incubated with HS5, P1 and P4
SNs showed activation of AKT and mTOR compared
to normal growth medium (M), P2 and P3 SNs (nonprotective). These results indicate that primary BMSC SNs
from AML patients with a “protective” phenotype activate
AKT and mTOR intracellular pathways involved in cell
survival.

SN (Figure 6B). Importantly, these effects were not due
to changes in the expression of ENT1 at the mRNA or
protein level (Figure 6C), suggesting a post-translational
mechanism.
To investigate whether HS5 SN affects the
expression of ENT1 at the cell surface we performed
an ENT1 extracellular domain biotinylation assay [13].
This assay detected ENT1 at the cell surface and its
levels decreased after 2 hours of incubation with HS5
SN, became undetectable after 4 hours and remained
undetectable at 24 hours. There were no major changes
in the molecular mass of the transporter (Figure 6D).
These results indicate that HS5 SN induced a rapid and
prolonged removal of ENT1 from the cell surface.
Taken together, these results indicate that soluble
factor(s) derived from BMSCs induce a removal of
ENT1 from the cell surface, resulting in lower nucleoside
transporter activity, which may be responsible for the
subsequent resistance of leukemia cells to the cytotoxic
effects of Ara-C.

Bone marrow stromal cell supernatant-induce
Ara-C chemoprotection by removing ENT1 from
the cell surface

The capacity of patients BMSCs to confer
resistance to Ara-C in vitro is a prognostic factor
for overall survival

Transport of Ara-C across the cell membrane is
primarily dependent on ENT1 and the ability of BMSC
SN to decrease ENT1 activity in murine leukemia cells
has been previously demonstrated [8]. In order to quantify
ENT1 transporter activity in these experiments, analysis
of 3H-adenosine incorporation into THP1 cells, cultured
with or without human BMSC SN from HS5 for 24 hours,
was assessed. HS5 SN decreased ENT1 activity 40%
compared to leukemia cells incubated in medium (Figure
6A). A significant reduction (50%) in ENT1 activity was
also observed in primary AML cells incubated with HS5

As BMSCs induced chemoresistance to Ara-C in
human THP-1 leukemia cells in vitro, we then investigated
whether the AML patient BMSC capacity to confer
resistance in-vitro correlated with clinical outcomes. We
obtained BM aspirate samples from 18 patients presenting
with AML, expanded their stroma, studied their capacity
to confer Ara-C chemoresistance in vitro, and analyzed
their correlation with overall survival. Table 1 details

the main clinical and diagnostic laboratory data of all 18
patients.
The capacity of BMSC SNs from 18 AML patients
(treated with conventional Ara-C based chemotherapy) to
confer resistance to Ara-C in vitro was investigated using
the THP1 cell chemosensitivity assay. In n=8 patients
(44.4%), the BM SN conferred resistance defined as an
increase in the Ara-C IC50 >100% in the THP1 survival
assay (IC50 means the Ara-C concentration able to kill
50% of tumor cells). We defined the “resistance factor”
as the Ara-C IC50 generated using the conditioned media
divided by the equivalent control IC50. For example, a
resistance factor of 2 means that the stroma SN confers
Ara-C resistance requiring a 100% dose increase
for the same activity. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis demonstrated that BMSC SNs from
these patients had a significant poor survival outcome
compared to patients with BMSC SNs that did not confer
chemoresistance (Figure 7A). The 2 years overall survival
rate was 0% versus 80% respectively, with a median

follow up of 513 days. The median survival was 290 days
in the survival group versus not reached in the second
group (HR 0.06 CI 0.014-0.257, ***p <0.0001). In the
examination of the stroma cells from patients with AML,
the stroma phenotype that conferred resistance to Ara-C
in the in vitro assay correlated with overall survival, as
previously observed (Figure 7A), and also with disease
relapse, the major risk factor for AML survival (p<
0.0001; Figure 7B). These results indicate that the BMSC
capacity to induce resistance of leukemia cells to Ara-C is
a major risk factor for relapse and overall survival. This
information was compared with the prognostic risk factors
conventionally studied for the stratification of patients into
low-, intermediate- and high-risk AML (including age,
leukocytosis >30,000 cells/mm3, complex karyotype and
low risk translocations t(15;17), t(8;21), inv16; and high
risk FLT3 ITD mutation). Interestingly, those patients with
BM stroma capable to confer resistance to Ara-C in vitro
are also of high-risk according to the conventional risk
factors (p<0.0032; Figure 7C) (Table 1).

SN HS5 treatment. TPH1 cells were incubated with human BMSC SN from HS5 (BM SN HS5) for the indicated time periods at 37°C and
were subjected to cell surface biotinylation at 4°C. The biotinylated proteins were then precipitated using Neutroavidin-Sepharose, resolved
in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-ENT1 antibodies. Total ENT1 corresponds to the immunoblot of 20% of the total
cell extract. BM SN HS5 treatment induced removal of ENT1 from the cell surface in the first 2 hours and extending to the 24 hours of the
experiment, without major changes in the ENT1 molecular mass.

In summary, these results presented here describe
the development of an in vitro assay that determines
the capacity of AML patient stroma to confer Ara-C
resistance, as a strong risk factor for the clinical outcomes

The HS5 cell line is a human marrow stromal cell
line immortalized by transduction with the papilloma
virus E6/E7 that supports proliferation of hematopoietic
progenitor cells when co-cultured in serum-deprived
media with no exogenous factors. They produce significant
levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),
granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), macrophageCSF (M-CSF), Kit ligand (KL), macrophage-inhibitory
protein-1a, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-11[18]. Even
a 1000-fold dilution of HS5 and a 100-fold dilution of
primary AML BMSC SNs preserved the capacity to confer
Ara-C chemoresistance to leukemia cells. This suggests
that BMSCs secrete soluble factors which are highly
potent in protecting leukemia cells from Ara-C treatment.
An inter-cellular communication method which has
recently been described, involves secretion of membrane
fragments classified as microvesicles or exosomes
according with the isolation procedure [19, 20]. Previous
work by Wang et al. showed that BMSCs communicate
with multiple myeloma cells through exosomes which
carry selective cytokines, favoring tumor proliferation,

DISCUSSION
Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis
that the interaction between leukemia cells with the
BM stroma results in a protective environment favoring
tumor development and resistance to cytotoxic treatments
[14-17]. We investigated the mechanisms involved in
BMSCs mediated AML chemoresistance to identify
potential predictive markers for clinical response to Ara-C
treatment.
BMSCs SN from both the HS5 cell line and primary
BMSCs (about 50% of cases) was shown to protect
leukemia cells from Ara-C induced cytotoxicity in vitro.
These data support our previous findings using an in
vivo/in vitro mouse AML model [7, 8].

migration, drug resistance and survival [21]. However, in
our experiments, SN fractions containing microvesicles
or exosomes caused no protection of THP1 cells from
the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C, in contrast to the fraction
containing BMSCs-secreted soluble proteins. These results
provide evidence that the protection conferred by the
stroma involves protein factors which are not transferred
by microvesicles or exosomes.
The BM stroma cells play a crucial role in drug
resistance, control of cell growth and leukemia cell
survival [22]. We demonstrated that HS5 SN caused a
significant accumulation of leukemia cells in G0/G1 phase
(cell cycle arrest), decreased the fraction of proliferating
(S-phase) and G2/M cell division phase of THP1 cells.
This cell cycle arrest indicates that BMSCs secreted
soluble factors can crucially contribute to enhance the
accumulation of quiescent leukemia cells within the BM
microenvironment. Conversely, cell cycle quiescence is
also a known mechanism of stroma-induced resistance to
cell cycle-specific chemotherapy agents such as Ara-C [9].

We and others have demonstrated that BMSCs
can trigger activation of multiple pro-survival signaling
pathways both through secreted soluble factors and by
direct cell-to-cell communication [7, 8, 23-27]. Zeng et al.
demonstrated that the stroma stimulated the PI3K/mTOR/
AKT pro-survival signaling pathway by up-regulating
phosphorylation of AKT [28]. We showed that HS5 SN
activated phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR indicating
an increased activity of these pro-survival kinases in
THP-1 cells. The AKT signaling pathway is thought to
play an important role in the resistance of BM-resident
AML cells and determines the level of residual leukemia
cells in AML patients. The molecular mechanisms of AML
chemoresistance to Ara-C have been widely investigated
and mainly involve the constitutive activation of tyrosine
kinase receptors and intracellular signal transduction
molecules such as PI3K, ERK, AKT, mTOR [9, 28, 29].
Konopleva et al 2013, proposed that TGF-β secreted by
the BM stroma cells plays an important role in AML
chemoresistance to Ara-C [9]. Piya et al. has also shown

patients with AML whose BMSCs were isolated, cultured and used for chemosensitivity tests with THP1. THP1 cells were cultured with or
without primary human BMSC SN from AML patients for 2 hours before treatment with Ara-C (0.2, 0.6 and 2.5 μg/ml) for 48 hours. THP1

that BM microenvironment autophagy plays an important
role in AML chemoresistance [30]. Furthermore, recent
reports have focused on the overexpression of the
oncogene ERG and also phosphoinositide 4-phosphatase
as potential markers for treatment failure in patients with
AML [31, 32].
Ara-C continues to be the most effective agent
for the treatment of patients with AML. Once inside the
cell, Ara-C is phosphorylated to Ara-CTP, which is then
incorporated into the DNA causing its cytotoxic effect by
inhibition of DNA synthesis. Ara-C resistance is thought
to arise from a deficiency in Ara-C phosphorylation by
deoxyxytidine kinase (dCK) associated with an increased
inactivation of Ara-C by deamination from cytidine
deaminase (CDA). However, even though these enzymatic
activities may contribute to the resistance of cells to Ara-C
still have not shown to be valuable predictors of clinical
response to Ara-C treatment [33-36].
The nucleoside transporter ENT1 is responsible
for up to 80% of Ara-C influx into human leukemic
cells [4, 11]. A deficiency in ENT1 confers high-level
of resistance to Ara-C in leukemia cells [37, 38], and a
lower expression of ENT1 mRNA has been related with
a shorter disease-free survival in patients with AML [39].
One of the most frequent class I mutations in patients with
AML is fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem
duplication (FLT3-ITD), which occurs in about 25% of
AML patients. Interestingly, a recent report suggested
that the FLT3-ITD specifically induces Ara-C resistance
in AML by repressing ENT1 mRNA expression [40]. We
showed that inhibition of ENT1 by NBMPR, a selective
ENT1 small molecule inhibitor, conferred a significant
chemoprotection to leukemia cells from Ara-C. Similarly,
our studies showed a significant reduction of ENT1
activity in AML cell line THP1 and primary AML cells
incubated with HS5 SN. In-line with previously reported
findings in a murine model system [41], no changes in
ENT1 mRNA or protein expression was observed in
THP1 cells treated with HS5 SN. This suggests that a
post-translational process controls ENT1 activity at the
cell surface, either by directly modifying the transporter
efficiency or inducing its endocytic removal from the
plasma membrane. Although the first possibility cannot be
ruled-out, this study shows evidence, using a cell surface
biotinylation assay, that HS5 SN induces a rapid (within
2 hours) and prolonged (24 hours) removal of ENT1 from
the cell surface.
To explore the translational relevance of
these observations, the prognostic value of Ara-C
chemoresistance conferred by the BM stroma was
evaluated in patient samples with AML. Overall analysis
demonstrated that the intensity and variation of Ara-C
sensitivity (IC50) of primary leukemia cells in vitro with
HS5 SN was not a prognostic survival factor for AML
patients (cohort of 20 patients). Furthermore, leukemia
sensitivity to Ara-C did not correlate with induction
remission 30 days post chemotherapy treatment. On

the other hand, primary BMSC SN (cohort of 18 AML
patients) in vitro chemoprotective effect over THP-1 cells
correlated with patient overall survival. Furthermore,
only 40% of all AML BMSC SNs tested showed positive
chemoprotective effect to leukemia THP-1 cells. It is
therefore possible that the stroma-leukemia biology may
be even more relevant than the leukemia genetics.
We propose that the stroma probably develops the
capacity to confer leukemia resistance to Ara-C in vivo
induced by tumor cells such as AML and this itself could
add additional prognostic information to the standard
risk-factors currently in use to stratify the risk of AML
patients. This may provide additional information for
intermediate-risk patients that do not harbor any known
predictive markers or for patients older than 60 years old
(have a poor prognosis as a group) who are not normally
offered treatment with curative intent. The evaluation
of the stroma capacity to confer resistance could enable
recognition of a subgroup of patients who may benefit
from alternative treatment strategies. This mechanism
of resistance conferred by the stroma may be a common
mechanism observed in different types of tumors.
Remarkably, this BM capacity to confer resistance to
Ara-C was preferentially observed in those patients that
harbored high-risk prognostic factors associated with poor
survival. We propose the hypothesis that the leukemia
from high-risk patients is capable of educating the tumor
stroma to acquire secondarily the capacity to confer
resistance.
In summary, this study demonstrated that human
BM stroma secretes soluble factor(s) which assists AML
cells in developing resistance to Ara-C. This mechanism
seems to occur by ENT1 transporter removal from the cell
surface. Interestingly, some AML patients harbor a BM
stroma that has acquired the capacity to confer resistance
and this stroma phenotype correlates with patient overall
survival. This observation requires further study to confirm
whether the BM stroma is a prognostic or predictive factor
to Ara-C clinical response that may contribute to stratify
patient’s risk optimizing the treatment approaches.
New strategies to improve current therapies in AML
are urgently needed to induce remission and to eliminate
residual disease, especially in patients with AML relapse
that are incurable with conventional chemotherapy. It
would be important to search for specific inhibitors of
the BM stroma-resistance pathway, to render existing
treatments more effective.

Samples from patients with AML

Ara-C for 48 (human cell lines) or 72 hours (primary AML
samples) before cell viability analysis.

Primary AML samples from the BM were obtained
from patients with newly diagnosed AML who had
provided informed consent in accordance with institutional
guidelines set forth by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty
of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile
(CEI-MEDUC 10-101).

Detection of cell viability
THP1 and U937 AML cells and primary AML
cells were cultured in 96-well plates with or without
BM SN for 2 hours before treatment with Ara-C for
24 hours. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Two hours before
ending the treatment, 10 μl of MTT (5mg/ml saline) was
added to each well, the samples were incubated for 2 hours
at 37°C. Cells were lysed and MTT crystals solubilized
by the addition of 100 μl of 0.02 N HCl in isopropanol.
The absorbance of each well was determined at 590nm
using a BioTek microplate reader (BioTek instruments,
Winooski, VT). Cell viability (%) was calculated relative
to the control.

AML cell culture and purification
The human BMSC line HS5 (HS5 BMSCs) was
kindly provided by Dr. John DiPersio (Washington
University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA). The
THP1 and U937 AML cell lines were purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were cultured
in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, non-essential amino acids
and 2 mm L-glutamine (complete medium) in a humidified
incubator at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide. To prepare
supernatant (SN) from HS5, cells were grown for 24 hours
in supplemented RPMI to near confluence, centrifuged at
1,000 g for 5 minutes. Cell-free culture SNs was obtained
by passage through a 0.45μm sterile filter. For serial
dilutions of the BMSC SN, the HS5 or primary BMSC
SN was diluted accordingly using fresh RPMI culture
medium.
AML BM aspirates collected during standard
diagnostic procedures were obtained from the posterior
iliac crest and collected in a heparinized syringe.
Mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll-Histopaque
density-gradient centrifugation as described by the
manufacturers (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences AB, Uppsala,
Sweden). Patient samples were re-suspended in complete
RPMI 1640 medium and were analyzed by flow cytometry
and only patients with ≥50% AML blasts were used for
chemosensitivity studies. Mononuclear cells were also
re-suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin mixture followed
by plating at an initial seeding density of 1 x 106 cells/
cm2. After 3 days, the non-adherent cells were removed
by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and monolayers of adherent cells were cultured until
they reached confluence. Cells were then trypsinized,
sub-cultured and allowed to grow to near confluence
to use for the experiments. Cell-free culture SNs was
obtained by passage through a 0.45μm sterile filter. The
primary BM SC cultures were negative for markers of
the hematopoietic lineage CD14, CD34, and CD45 as
analyzed by flow cytometry.

Cell proliferation assay
THP1 cells grown in 24-well plates with or without
HS5 BM SN were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine at
various time-points as described by the manufacturers
(FITC BrdU flow kit, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA).
THP1 cells were harvested, fixed and labelled with antiBrdU fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody and 7-AAD to
analyze proliferation by flow cytometry.

Microvesicle purification
Vesicle purification was performed as previously
described [10, 42]. HS5 cells were cultivated in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% exosome-free FBS
(obtained by serum ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 12
h) for 48 hours. The HS5 SN was then subjected to serial
centrifugations at 300g for 10 minutes (pellet discarded),
3000g for 10 minutes (pellet discarded); followed by
10,000g for 30 minutes at 4°C and by ultracentrifugation
at 100,000g for 70 minutes at 4°C. Different pellets
named P10 (large vesicles 1-5 μm diameter) (after
the 10,000g centrifugation) and P100 (exosomes)
(after 100,000g ultracentrifugation) were washed in
cold 0.1M phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) and
centrifuged again at respectively 10,000g or 100,000g.
Both pellets were re-suspended in RPMI medium. The
100,000g ultracentrifugation SN was named S100 and
predominantly contained soluble proteins.

Protein extraction and western blot
Cell pellets were washed twice in ice cold PBS and
lysed with lysis buffer and protease inhibitors (20 mM
Tris (pH 7.5), 1% triton, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl
and 2 mM EDTA, 250 μM PMSF, 5μg/ml leupeptin)
for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm

measured using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Fifty micrograms of proteins
were equally loaded to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (PVDF) (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA). Membranes were developed
using Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Thermo
Scientific). The following antibodies were used for
immunoblotting: AKT, phosphorylated AKT (Ser473),
mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR and β-actin, purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA; and human
ENT1 from Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA, USA.

radioactivity and 20% to measure total protein content.
Difference between total transport and transport in
the presence of 1 μM NBMPR was defined as ENT1adenosine transport.

Isolation of RNA and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

All data are given as means ± S.D. of at least three
independent experiments. Comparison of treatments
against controls was made using one-way Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s least
significant difference post hoc test. Data with two
groups to compare were analyzed using a t-test. Survival
curves were generated using the method of Kaplan and
Meier and analyzed by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism
5 statistical package. The significance level chosen for the
statistical analysis was p < 0.05.

ENT1 cell surface detection
ENT1 present at the cell surface was assessed by
a cell surface biotinylation assay with EZ-Link SulfoNHS-Biotin followed by precipitation with NeutroavidinAgarose and immunoblot, as previously described [13].

Statistical analysis

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen)
as described by the manufacturer. Complementary DNA
was subsequently synthesized from total cellular RNA
using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) and PCR was performed using a PCR thermal
cycler (Labnet International Inc. Edison, NJ, USA).
The PCR program used to amplify hENT1 and GAPDH
consisted of a pre-cycle of 5 minutes at 94°C, 30 seconds
at 30°C and 30 seconds at 72°C. Following this initial
cycle, the reaction was continued for 26 cycles of 30
seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 60°C, and 30 seconds at
72°C and concluded with 5 minutes at 72°C. The primers
sequences were as follows: hENT1 forward primer:
5’-ATCTGCGCTATTGCCAGTG-3’; hENT1 reverse
primer: 5’-TCCAACTTGGTCTCCTGCTC-3’; GAPDH
forward primer: 5’-CACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3’;

ENT1 activity

GRANT FUNDING SUPPORT

The ENT1 activity assay was performed as described
previously [41], using a sodium free transport assay buffer
(20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 3 mM K2HPO4, 1 mM MgCl2 6
H2O, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose and 130 mM N-methylD-glucamine (NMDG, pH 7.4). Briefly, cells were washed
once with transport assay buffer and then suspended in
transport assay buffer. After a pre-incubation with 1 μM
NBMPR or vehicle (DMSO) for 15 minutes, uptake assays
were started by adding equal volume of transport buffer
containing 2 μM cold adenosine, [3H]-adenosine 4 μCi/
ml plus NBMPR or DMSO. Time course of uptake under
these conditions was performed to determine linearity (not
shown). Uptake was stopped after 5 minutes followed by
five rapid washes with ice cold transport buffer containing
1 mM unlabeled adenosine. The cell pellets were lysed
in a lysis buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH7.5), 137
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and 2 mM
EDTA. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C, 80% of the SN was used to measure incorporated
