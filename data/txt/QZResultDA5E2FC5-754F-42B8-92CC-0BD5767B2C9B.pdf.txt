Abstract
Exploration of new strategies for the prevention of breast cancer metastasis is justiﬁably at the center of clinical attention. In this
study, we combined a computational biology approach with
mechanism-based preclinical trials to identify inhibitors of activin-like receptor kinase (ALK) 1 as effective agents for blocking
angiogenesis and metastasis in breast cancer. Pharmacologic targeting of ALK1 provided long-term therapeutic beneﬁt in mouse
models of mammary carcinoma, accompanied by strikingly
reduced metastatic colonization as a monotherapy or part of

combinations with chemotherapy. Gene-expression analysis of
breast cancer specimens from a population-based nested case–
control study encompassing 768 subjects deﬁned endothelial
expression of ALK1 as an independent and highly speciﬁc prognostic factor for metastatic manifestation, a ﬁnding that was
corroborated in an independent clinical cohort. Overall, our results
suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of endothelial ALK1 constitutes a tractable strategy for interfering with metastatic dissemination of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 75(12); 2445–56. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

disseminated breast cancer, both for the neoadjuvant and the
adjuvant setting, are sorely needed.
The angiogenic process is required for tumor progression from
an indolent state (5). The vascular tree provides a tumor with its
metabolic requirements, while simultaneously providing an
escape route by which malignant cells can leave the primary
tumor bulk. Indeed, in particular cases, high vascular density was
demonstrated to be a prognostic factor for poor outcome in breast
cancer, as well as in other malignancies (6, 7). The introduction of
multitargeted agents incorporating antiangiogenic activity in
clinical practice has led to improved disease control in terms of
prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). Consequently, drugs
targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway
are now included in the ﬁrst line therapy for metastatic disease for
a range of malignancies (8–11). However, attempts to target
tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer has met with ambiguous
success (12, 13). Although providing initial relief for metastatic
breast cancer patients by improving response rates and prolonging PFS, no conclusive evidence for long-term beneﬁt in OS has
been provided to date (13). Consistent with this clinical reality,
recent preclinical studies indicate that tumors in mice treated
systemically with anti-VEGF therapy rapidly acquire resistance,
coupled to recurring tumors that appear to be more locally
invasive and have a higher propensity to seed distant metastases
(14–16). Thus, the need for a mechanism-based and clinically
relevant search for alternative angiogenic pathways that may serve
as targets for more efﬁcacious drugs without affecting disease stage
in breast cancer is highly warranted.
ALK1 is a type I receptor in the large TGFb family expressed
selectively by endothelial cells (17). Pharmacologic targeting of
ALK1 has demonstrable therapeutic efﬁcacy in a diverse set of
mouse models of cancer (18–20). Here, we investigate the utility
of ALK1 inhibition as an antimetastatic therapy in breast cancer
using a combined approach of preclinical testing of a clinically

Exploration of new strategies for the prevention of breast cancer
metastasis is justiﬁably at the center of clinical attention (1).
The haematogenous dissemination of tumor cells is a multistep
process requiring: (i) detachment of malignant cells from the
primary tumor, (ii) intravasation into and extravasation from the
blood stream, and (iii) colonization of the distant organ (2).
However, we currently have limited knowledge on the molecular
drivers contributing to each of the steps in the metastatic cascade
in breast cancer, and thus efforts to target-speciﬁc signaling pathways involved in the systemic spread of the disease have largely
been unsuccessful so far (3). In cases where breast tumors are
found in early stages, the prognosis following adequate therapy is
good with a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate reaching above 90%
(4). Nevertheless, many women are not diagnosed until the tumor
has reached advanced stages; tumor stage is an established factor
for poor prognosis (4). Thus, novel treatment strategies to combat

tractable ALK1 inhibitor and analysis of gene-expression patterns
relating to metastatic spread in breast cancer patient specimens.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 were maintained in culture in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FCS. EO771 breast cancer cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS.
Animal care and tumor establishment
All animal experiments were approved by the local ethical
committee for animal care in Stockholm and Lund (permits
N96/11 and M142/13). The RIP-TAg2 mice (C57Bl6/J background) received water supplemented with 5% sugar to alleviate
hypoglycemia from 10 weeks of age. Total tumor burden per
mouse was calculated as the sum of the volume of each individual
tumor dissected from a RIP-TAg2 mouse pancreas. The MMTVPyMT mice (FVB/n strain background) were followed for tumor
growth from 8 to 12 weeks in early-stage trials and from 11 to 15
weeks of age in late stage trials. Primary tumor burden was
determined by caliper measurements on live sedated mice once
a week and the total tumor burden per mouse was calculated as
the sum of the volume of each individual mammary tumor. To
establish EO771 tumors, 5  105 cells were injected orthotopically into the fourth mammary fat pad of isoﬂuran-anesthesized
wildtype C57Bl6/J females. 1  106 cells of the human metastatic
breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were transplanted s.c. to
immunocompromised SCID mice. In all cases, tumor volume was
calculated as length  width2  p/6.
Therapeutic trials
Control IgG or RAP-041 (Acceleron Pharma) was diluted in TBS
and administered twice weekly by i.p. injection at 12 mg/kg per
injection. Mice carrying orthotopic EO771 mammary carcinomas
were treated with either RAP-041 or IgG2a for 2 weeks starting 7
days following tumor establishment. Treatment with docetaxel
(Taxotere, Sanoﬁ-Aventis) was administered once weekly at 20
mg/kg by i.p. injection.
Tissue preparation, histology, and immunostaining
Mice were heart-perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. For parafﬁn-embedding, organs were post-ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours before proceeding to embedding. Parafﬁn-embedded sections were deparafﬁnized and
rehydrated followed by antigen retrieval in low pH buffer (pH
6; DAKO) for 20 min at 95 C. Blocking was performed in 10%
normal goat serum in TNB buffer (PerkinElmer). The primary
antibody against the PyMT oncogene (1:100; Abcam ab15085)
was incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 C. For SV40 T-

Ag staining, a high pH antigen retrieval buffer (pH 10; DAKO)
was used, followed by washes and quenching of endogenous
peroxidase activity with 50% methanol/3% H2O2 in PBS for 10
minutes in room temperature. A wash in PBS preceded blocking
with 10% normal goat serum in TNB for 1 hour. The primary
antibody against T-Ag (1:1,000; a kind gift from Douglas
Hanahan, EPFL) was incubated at 4 C overnight. After washes
with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, a suitable biotinylated
secondary antibody was incubated for 45 minutes in room
temperature.
For cryopreservation, tumors, livers and/or lungs were kept in
30% sucrose at 4 C overnight, followed by embedding in cryosectioning media. Frozen sections were ﬁxed in ice-cold acetone,
followed by blocking using serum free protein block (DAKO) for
>90 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibodies directed
against CD31 (dilution 1:100; Pharmingen MEC13.3), podocalyxin (dilution 1:100; R&D Systems, AF1556), and BMP9 (dilution 1:500; Abcam; ab35088) were incubated overnight at 4 C.
Appropriate Alexa 594 and Alexa 488–ﬂourochrome-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used and sections were
ﬁnally mounted using 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting media (Vector Laboratories).
Quantiﬁcation of metastases
The right lateral liver lobe from RIP-TAg2 mice or the left lung
lobes of MMTV-PyMT or EO771-bearing mice were embedded in
parafﬁn upon tissue ﬁxation. The metastatic burden was assessed
by serial sectioning of the entire lung/liver lobe. Following hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining on every 25th section, the
number of metastatic foci (>8 cells in diameter) was determined
in >15 sections per mouse and >5 mice per group.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA of 12-weeks-old MMTV-PyMT mice mammary tissue
was isolated using TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen), followed by the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. A 1 mg total RNA was subsequently used to generate
cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed using the KAPA
SYBR Fast qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) on a Rotorgene 6000
(Qiagen) in triplicates using primers purchased from Qiagen:
RPL19, TGFb, BMP9/GDF2, BMP10, and GDF5 (QuantiTect
Primer Assays QT00166145, QT00145250, QT00307587,
QT00259847, and QT00250523, respectively). Primers for analysis of Id1 and Id3 as in ref. 18.
Tumor grade assessment
To assess the tumor grade of lesions from MMTV-PyMT mice,
tumor tissue was classiﬁed into different degrees of progression by
quantifying the area of transformed glands occupied by each

stage. Progression follows from normal fat tissue to a "precancerous stage" characterized by premalignant hyperplasia and
adenoma (with the retention of some normal ductal and acinar
mammary gland morphology), to a more epithelial cell—dense
"early carcinoma" with stromal invasion, and ﬁnally to an invasive, very dense, high—mitotic index "late-stage carcinoma."
Tumors were evaluated for the proportion of mammary fat
tissue, hyperplastic tissue, adenoma, early carcinoma, and late
carcinoma.
Clinical datasets
Expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/) were downloaded in November 2013.
The data were log2 transformed after addition of 1 to each
normalized value. Clinical and follow-up data were downloaded
in May 2014. All analyses were done with R using the basic and
survival packages. Breast cancer subtypes were determined using
nearest correlations with the PAM50 centroids.
The nested case–control study gained approval by the ethics
committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. The
full details of the study design, collection of clinical-pathologic
information, gene-expression proﬁling of fresh frozen tumor
tissue and subsequent preprocessing and normalization of
microarray gene-expression data, and ﬁnally conditional logistic regression modeling of the nested case–control study have
been reported elsewhere (array data deposited at the Gene
Expression Omnibus Database under accession number
GSE48091; ref. 21), and is the subject of a separate report
(Lindstr€
om and colleagues; submitted for publication). Geneexpression data were collapsed to gene level using a nonspeciﬁc
ﬁlter keeping only the probe sets with highest interquartile
range in the case of multiple mappings to the same Entrez Gene
ID. As in the original publication, out of seven considered
clinical-pathologic variables—estrogen receptor (ER), progresterone receptor and HER2 status, histologic grade, proliferation, tumor size, and lymph node status—three variables,
namely lymph node status, tumor size, and HER2 status, were
considered signiﬁcant and included in multivariable conditional logistic regression models. A missing category was used to
handle missing values in clinical-pathologic data. All geneexpression data analysis and statistical analysis were done in
R/Bioconductor.
Statistical analysis
Unless speciﬁcally stated, all measurements are depicted as
mean  SD. Statistical analyses for tumor volume were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student t test. Statistical
analyses for tumor characteristics were performed using a
Mann–Whitney U test. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered
using a ¼ 0.05.

Results
Long-term inhibition of ALK1 impairs metastatic
dissemination and prolongs survival in an experimental model
of neuroendocrine tumorigenesis
We, and others, have previously documented the emergence of
therapeutic resistance toward anti-VEGF therapy using various
pharmacologic agents (14–16). Evasive resistance to VEGF-inhibitory modalities is accompanied by a hypoxia-driven malignization, that is, enhanced local invasion and increased rate of
metastatic seeding, of tumors in the prototypical RIP-TAg2 mouse
model of angiogenesis-dependent pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumorigenesis (NET). To investigate whether antiangiogenic therapy by inhibition of ALK1 signaling gives rise to a similar exacerbation of systemic dissemination, we contrasted previously performed short-term therapeutic trials (18) with a long-term regimen of single-agent neoadjuvant therapy using ALK1-Fc, a ligand
trap that neutralizes BMP9 and BMP10 (RAP-041, mouse counterpart of dalantercept; Fig. 1A). Regardless of the length or timing
of the treatment of RIP-TAg2 mice, single-agent RAP-041 gave rise
to a state of stable disease during the course of the trials, in contrast
with tumors in control-treated mice that consistently presented
with overt progressive disease (Fig. 1B and ref. 18). Despite
inducing a demonstrable reduction in vessel area, average vessel
length and the number of vessel endpoints, as judged by immunostaining for the endothelial cell markers podocalyxin or CD31
(Fig. 1C and data not shown), RAP-041 did not provoke widespread hypoxia, using CA IX or HIF1a expression as proxies for
low tissue oxygenation (Fig. 1D). Pancreatic NETs of RIP-TAg2
mice disseminate predominantly to sentinel lymph nodes in the
mesentery and to the liver, similar to the corresponding human
disease (Fig. 1E; ref. 22). The incidence of hepatic metastases in
RIP-TAg2 mice was not changed following short-term therapy
with RAP-041 (Fig. 1F). Strikingly, however, upon long-term
administration of neoadjuvant therapy with RAP-041 to mice
harboring advanced disease, the rate of metastatic dissemination
to the liver decreased by 86% compared with treatment with
control IgG (Fig. 1F). In sharp contrast with anti-VEGF therapy,
which induced an increased rate of metastasis (14, 16), ALK1
inhibition caused regression of preformed hepatic NET foci during the course of the therapeutic trial in RIP-TAg2 mice from an
average of 8.1 to 2.8 foci per histologic section (Fig. 1F). In line
with the substantial reduction in both primary tumor burden and
metastatic manifestation in RIP-TAg2 mice following ALK1 inhibition, the rate of OS at 16 weeks of age was also increased from
27% (11/41) to 79% (11/14; Fig. 1G).

cancer, we extended our analyses on the role of ALK1 signaling in

metastatic dissemination to this disease by studying the MMTVPyMT genetically engineered mouse model of mammary carcinoma; a mouse model faithfully recapitulating many aspects of
the human disease, including dissemination pattern to the lung
and lymph nodes (23). Initial characterization of mammary
tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice demonstrated an endothelial
cell–exclusive expression of ALK1 and readily detectable expression levels of its ligands BMP9, BMP10, and TGF-b (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C). Next, MMTV-PyMT mice were administered
RAP-041 from 8 to 12 weeks of age in a preclinical neoadjuvant
trial. Consistent with the effects in pancreatic NETs, inhibition of
ALK1 signiﬁcantly delayed the growth and reduced the vessel area
of primary mammary carcinomas (Fig. 2A–C). The observed
action of RAP-041 was a result of on-target effects, as demonstrated by diminished expression of the ALK1 target genes Id1 and
Id3 in tumor lysates (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Treatment
with RAP-041 had no discernible direct effect on the proliferation
or apoptosis of malignant cells isolated from MMTV-PyMT
tumors in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D), indicating
that the therapeutic beneﬁt was derived from indirect targeting of
tumor cells by impinging on the neoangiogenic process. Notably,
treatment with ALK1-Fc impeded the tumor progression pathway,
as evidenced by a shift in the tumor grade from predominant
malignant and invasive lesions observed in the control group
(31% late carcinoma vs. 18% normal/hyperplasia/adenoma) to a
higher degree of premalignant lesions in the treated group (6%
late carcinoma vs. 40% normal/hyperplasia/adenoma; Fig. 2D).
Importantly, the impaired tumor progression also translated into
an 87% decrease in metastatic colonization of the lung (Fig. 2E
and F). Tumor growth rate and vessel area were similarly compromised following neoadjuvant treatment with ALK1-Fc of older
MMTV-PyMT mice already presenting with fully established disease (Fig. 3A–C). Again, inhibition of ALK1 expressed solely by
the tumor endothelium signiﬁcantly reduced the rate of metastasis by 55% (Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore, in addition to reducing
the number of metastatic foci, RAP-041 treatment also signiﬁcantly moderated the average size of the pulmonary metastatic
lesions (Fig. 3F).
ALK1 inhibition induces angiogenic and metastatic blockade in
experimental mammary carcinoma
To corroborate our ﬁndings of a role for endothelial ALK1
signaling in the metastatic cascade in breast tumors, we transplanted the ER-expressing mouse mammary carcinoma cell line
EO771 orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of mice. The
expression of BMP9 and TGF-b in EO771 tumor tissue was
conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR or immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Consistent with our previous observations,
administration of ALK1-Fc signiﬁcantly delayed the growth of

EO771 tumors (Fig. 3G) with concomitant reduction of vessel
area (Fig. 3H and I). Importantly, neoadjuvant treatment of
EO771-bearing mice with RAP-041 reduced the metastatic success
rate to the lung by 87% (Fig. 3J), further demonstrating the
involvement of ALK1 ligands and the tumor endothelium in the
process of tumor cell dissemination to distant sites.
A combined therapeutic regimen of ALK1-Fc and docetaxel
reduces tumor growth and metastatic dissemination
Neoadjuvant therapy of breast cancer is increasingly being used
in order to reduce the primary tumor bulk, enable breast-conserving surgery and prevent metastatic manifestation (1). Therefore, we
investigated the utility of combining inhibition of ALK1 with
commonly used pharmacologic treatment strategies for breast
cancer in a series of preclinical trials enrolling MMTV-PyMT mice
in the neoadjuvant setting. Combined administration of RAP-041
with trastuzumab or the VEGFR2-neutralizing antibody DC101
did not yield any, or only marginal, therapeutic beneﬁt compared
with either treatment alone (data not shown). Strikingly, however,
concomitant inhibition of ALK1 with neoadjuvant docetaxel gave
rise to improved control of tumor growth (Fig. 4A). The addition of
RAP-041 to the docetaxel regimen resulted in partial responses in 5
of 13 (38%) mice, compared with 0 of 10 (0%) in mice treated with
single-agent docetaxel (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, treatment with single-agent docetaxel afforded a signiﬁcant reduction of tumor
vascularity; an effect that was exacerbated by combination treatment with RAP-041 (Fig. 4C and D). Most notably, the combination of ALK1-Fc and chemotherapy brought about a further 63%
decrease in the metastatic index of the lung compared with docetaxel alone and prevented colonization of pulmonary metastases
by 93% compared with control therapy (Fig. 4E).
ALK1 is an independent biomarker for metastatic recurrence of
human breast cancer
Comparative studies demonstrated widespread expression of
BMP9 protein, but not BMP10 protein, by malignant cells in
human breast carcinomas (Fig. 5A). Functionality of the ALK1
paracrine signaling network and therapeutic utility of ALK1-Fc in
the human setting was demonstrated by near-complete retardation of the growth of orthotopic xenografts of the aggressive triplenegative human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 by
treatment with ACE-041/dalantercept (the human counterpart
of RAP-041; Fig. 5B). Next, to explore whether the expression of
ALK1 (gene name ACVRL1) holds prognostic capability for metastatic disease in human patients, we analyzed gene-expression
patterns in tumor material from a population-based nested case–
control study encompassing 768 subjects with complete clinical
follow-up (21). Brieﬂy, 190 breast cancer patients that developed
distant metastatic disease (cases) were selected from a consecutive

Targeting ALK1 Impairs Distant Breast Cancer Dissemination

series of individuals and three random control patients (free from
metastasis) for each case were closely matched by adjuvant
therapy, age and calendar period at diagnosis (21). Expression
of ACVRL1 was found to correlate signiﬁcantly with prototypical
endothelial cell genes, further corroborating the predominant
vascular expression of ALK1 in human breast cancers (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, ACVRL1 expression was signiﬁcantly correlated to the expression of its target gene Id1, implying
activation of the pathway (data not shown). In strong support of
our functional data, abundant expression of ACVRL1 was highly
signiﬁcantly associated with the incidence of metastatic disease
(Table 1). Similarly, expression of SMAD6, a known downstream
target gene of ALK1 activation was linked to recurrent disease
(Table 1). In sharp contrast, the expression of the canonical TGFb
type I receptor ALK5 (TGFBRI) and its ligands TGFb1-3, that are
implicated in promotion of metastasis through induction of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was equally distributed between cases and controls, with the exception of TGFb1,
expression of which was marginally associated with metastatic
disease (Table 1). Importantly, in a multivariate analysis of risk
factors for presenting with metastatic disease, expression of both
ACVRL1 (HR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.52–5.15) and SMAD6 (HR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.15–1.77) remained as statistically signiﬁcant and
independent prognostic factors, alongside well-known clinical
risk factors such as lymph node status, tumor size, and HER2
ampliﬁcation (Table 1). Intriguingly, the known ligands for ALK1,
that is, BMP9 (GDF2) and BMP10, were only weakly associated to
metastasis, even when their expression was combined (Table 1).
High expression of endothelial ALK1 is an independent
prognostic factor for poor survival in human breast cancer
To further validate our ﬁnding of a functional association
between ALK1 signaling and metastatic colonization in human
breast cancer, we analyzed breast cancer gene-expression data from
TCGA. The validation set revealed that expression of ACVRL1 was
indeed correlated with the expression of well-known endothelial
markers (Supplementary Table S1). Next, a Cox proportional
hazards model was applied to gene-expression data from TCGA
with event-free survival as the endpoint. Univariate models did not
demonstrate any signiﬁcant prognostic information held by either
ACVRL1 itself (data not shown) or by a general vascular index

markers PECAM1, CDH5, and CD34; hereafter referred to as the
endothelial metagene). Strikingly, however, in a multivariate model (Table 2), both the ACVRL1 expression level (HR, 2.35; 95% CI,
1.34–4.09) and the endothelial metagene (HR, 0.46; 95% CI,
0.28–0.74) were independent prognostic factors for event-free
survival, also after adjustment for lymph node status and stratiﬁcation for the molecular subtype of the disease according to the
PAM50 proﬁle. The opposing HRs of the vascular index and
the ACVRL1 expression level in this dataset suggested that the

molecular characteristics, rather than the absolute extent of vascularization, hold prognostic information. The ratio between
ACVRL1 expression and the endothelial metagene (i.e., the relative
expression of ACVRL1 per endothelial cell) was, therefore, evaluated and found to serve as a highly speciﬁc prognostic biomarker
for recurrent disease; breast cancer patients within the quartile of
highest ACVRL1:endothelial metagene ratio were subject to an
exceedingly poor event-free survival, compared with those patients
with the lowest ratio (Fig. 5C). Reassuringly, the independent
prognostic capability of the ACVRL1:endothelial metagene index
was conﬁrmed by analysis of gene-expression data from the nested
case–control study (Table 1). Further analysis revealed that the
association between the ACVRL1:endothelial metagene index and
distant metastases was robust regardless of treatment received and
was not a feature of any particular molecular subtype or size of
breast tumor (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C).

of ALK1 signaling in advanced genetically engineered mouse
models of breast cancer with preclinical efﬁcacy trials of a clinTable 2. Multivariable analysis of the impact of prognostic parameters on

ically tractable pharmacologic inhibitor of ALK1 and expression
analysis of ACVRL1 in human patient materials in relation to
relevant clinical parameters for metastatic disease. The present
studies strongly suggest an independent role for endothelial ALK1
signaling in the process of metastatic dissemination and colonization of distant organs in breast cancer. On the basis of our
ﬁndings, pharmacologic inhibitors of the ALK1 pathway, thus,
present as attractive and realistic partners with chemotherapy in
the management of metastatic breast cancer.
ALK1-blocking agents are currently being developed clinically
for various malignancies (17). Dalantercept (ACE-041), the
human counterpart of RAP-041, is an ALK1 ligand trap comprising the extracellular domain of ALK1 fused to the Fc portion of
IgG. Phase I clinical trials demonstrate the safety and tolerability
of dalantercept; the most common and dose-limiting side effects
include peripheral edema and ﬂuid retention (24). Likewise, the
fully human ALK1-neutralizing antibody PF-03446962 has concluded phase I clinical trials with grade 3 thrombocytopenia and
increase in pancreatic enzymes as the dose-limiting toxicities (25).
Both compounds show evidence for on-target effects on the
neoangiogenic vasculature in functional imaging modalities, such
as 18FDG-PET and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (24,
25). Notably, the side effect proﬁle of the ALK1 targeting agents is
distinct from that of anti-VEGF compounds, such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, and sorafenib, indicating a unique mechanism of
action. In our preclinical trials, we found that, unlike VEGF
pathway inhibitors, prolonged administration of ALK1-Fc did
not give rise to widespread tissue hypoxia, rebound of tumor
growth, increased local invasion or augmented seeding of distant

Targeting ALK1 Impairs Distant Breast Cancer Dissemination

metastases (14–16, 26). In sharp contrast, neutralization of ALK1
ligands in the neoadjuvant setting resulted in a substantial reduction in metastatic colonization and in some cases even regression
of preexisting metastatic lesions. It is interesting to note that the
ALK1 target gene Id1, which we found to be substantially downregulated following treatment with RAP-041 and signiﬁcantly
correlated to ALK1 expression in human breast tumors, is part
of a gene-expression signature predictive of breast cancer lung
metastasis (27) and suppression of Id1 impairs metastatic colonization in a mouse model of lung carcinoma (28). The fact that
ALK1 inhibition did not provoke tissue hypoxia is the most likely
cause for the observed discrepancy with anti-VEGF therapy, as
hypoxia has been suggested to be the main driving force for the
malignization of tumors following VEGF blockade in preclinical
studies (14, 26). The relative lack of hypoxia, despite reduced
vessel area, implicitly suggests that ALK1 inhibition improves the
exchange of oxygen and nutrients across the abnormal neovasculature in tumors. Further mechanistic studies of the distinct effects
of ALK1-Fc on the tumor vasculature are warranted.
Herein, we provide compelling evidence from a populationbased nested case–control study encompassing 768 subjects (23)
that high expression of ACVRL1 in the tumor vasculature serves as
a highly signiﬁcant biomarker for a metastatic phenotype in breast
cancer, alongside traditional risk factors such as lymph node
status, tumor size and HER2 ampliﬁcation. This ﬁnding was
corroborated by analysis of the independent TCGA dataset, in
which the expression of endothelial ACVRL1 was found to be
strongly associated with event-free survival. Our ﬁndings should
be conﬁrmed at the protein level, but we have been unable to do
so in the current study despite substantial efforts, due to a lack of
speciﬁc reagents to detect the ALK1 protein in human tissues (data
not shown). Intriguingly, ALK1 expression was closely linked to
prototypical endothelial cell marker genes, providing further
evidence that the endothelium takes an active part as a key
regulator of the metastatic process; an aspect of the vascular wall
that has been highlighted also in recent studies of signaling
pathways emanating from endoglin, CCL2/CCR2 and HIF1a/
2a in the tumor endothelium (16, 29, 30). Signaling by TGFb in
malignant cells promotes many aspects of the metastatic process,
most notably migration and invasion, through induction of EMT
(31). We recently demonstrated that the action of TGFb on the
vasculature weakens the endothelial cell barrier to tumor cell
intravasation, thus endorsing malignant cell escape from the
primary site into the bloodstream through an analogous mesenchymal transition of endothelial cells (16). Hence, the mechanism behind the antimetastatic effect of single-agent ALK1-Fc
conceivably involves sealing the endothelial cell barrier to cancer
cell transmigration, thereby conﬁning malignant cells within the
primary tumor. Furthermore, combined neoadjuvant treatment
with RAP-041 and docetaxel eradicated the vast majority of
pulmonary metastases. Docetaxel treatment gives rise to a well-

documented reduction in vessel area (32), and the synergistic
interaction with ALK1 inhibition is, thus, likely to take place at the
level of the tumor endothelium.
Taken together, our mechanism-based therapeutic studies,
combined with gene-expression analysis of patient specimens
designed to investigate prometastatic factors, thus strongly support further development of ALK1-targeting agents, such as dalantercept and PF-03446962, as clinically tractable combination
partners for chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of distant
metastases in breast cancer.

Correction: Endothelial ALK1 Is a Therapeutic
Target to Block Metastatic Dissemination
of Breast Cancer
In this article (Cancer Res 2015;75:2445–56), which appeared in the June 15, 2015,
issue of Cancer Research (1), the authors present translational studies supporting a
causal link between the expression of the endothelial cell–expressed TGFb family
receptor ALK1 and metastatic dissemination of breast cancer. For a subsection of their
studies, the authors utilized data from gene expression analysis of patient samples
from a clinical cohort designed as a nested case–control study (data presented in
Table 1). In subsequent follow-up studies, the authors have uncovered a potential
bias in this dataset. Importantly, however, the analyses included in the article are
unaffected, and the conclusions of the work are not in question.
As background, a metastatic breast cancer cohort study was ﬁrst designed (2).
Thereafter, a case–control study nested in the corresponding primary breast cancer
cohort was designed by selecting distant metastasis–free controls to each case. Tumor
RNA was extracted in the same order. All RNAs were proﬁled on microarrays in
randomized order. For quality control, RNA was also reextracted in a randomized
order for randomly selected cases–controls sets and proﬁled with the rest. The
potential bias of the data from the nested case–control study is due to apparent
RNA extraction batch effects confounded with case–control status. Reassuringly, gene
expression data for endothelial ALK1 are consistent for a substudy in which RNA has
been reextracted from a new tumor piece in a randomized order.
The correlation between gene expression data for original and reextracted RNA is
excellent for key breast cancer genes, for example, ESR1 (r ¼ 0.95) and ERBB2 (r ¼
0.96). Bridging the primary comparison, case–control set differences (n ¼ 40) for
ACVRL1 and the ACVRL1:endothelial metagene index that we reported are consistent
between the two extractions (Fig. 1). A case–control set difference is the value for the
case minus the (average) value of the matched control(s).

Figure 1.
Case–control set differences in the original RNA extraction and in the reextracted RNA conﬁrms a close correlation
between datasets for both ACVRL1 gene expression (left) and for the ACVRL1:endothelial metagene index (right).

Although the potential bias of the dataset does not affect the outcome of the current
study, the authors recommend careful scrutiny of the data and inclusion of proper
controls when attempting other analyses based on these data. Microarray data for the
reextracted RNA are deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus database under
accession number GSE81954.
All authors have been informed of and agree to this correction.
