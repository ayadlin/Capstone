Abstract
The efﬁcacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used to treat solid tumors is limited by intercellular junctions
which tightly link epithelial tumor cells to each another. In this study, we deﬁne a small, recombinant adenovirus
serotype 3-derived protein, termed junction opener 1 (JO-1), which binds to the epithelial junction protein
desmoglein 2 (DSG2). In mouse xenograft models employing Her2/neu- and EGFR-positive human cancer cell
lines, JO-1 mediated cleavage of DSG2 dimers and activated intracellular signaling pathways which reduced
E-cadherin expression in tight junctions. Notably, JO-1-triggered changes allowed for increased intratumoral
penetration of the anti-Her2/neu mAb trastuzumab (Herceptin) and improved access to its target receptor, Her2/
neu, which is partly trapped in tight junctions. This effect translated directly into increased therapeutic efﬁcacy of
trastuzumab in mouse xenograft models using breast, gastric, and ovarian cancer cells that were Her2/neupositive. Furthermore, combining JO-1 with the EGFR-targeting mAb cetuximab (Erbitux) greatly improved
therapeutic outcomes in a metastatic model of EGFR-positive lung cancer. A combination of JO-1 with an
approach that triggered transient degradation of tumor stroma proteins elicited eradication of tumors. Taken
together, our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof of concept to employ JO-1 in combination with mAb therapy. Cancer

Introduction
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and cetuximab (Erbitux) are
humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used for the therapy
of Her2/neu- and EGFR-positive cancers, respectively. The
mechanisms of trastuzumab and cetuximab action include the
activation of antibody-dependent or complement-dependent
cytotoxicity, and interference with tyrosine kinase receptor
signaling (1). A unifying aspect among these mechanisms is
that tumor cell growth inhibition is dependent on the binding of
these mAbs to their corresponding receptors, that is, Her2/neu
and EGFR. Therefore, molecules that prevent access and binding to the receptor, either by physically inhibiting intratumoral
transport from blood vessels to malignant cells or masking of
receptors, are predicted to block trastuzumab and cetuximab

activity (2). Several studies showed that the expression or
upregulation of epithelial proteins correlated with increased
resistance to trastuzumab (3) and cetuximab (4) therapy.
Epithelial cells maintain several intercellular junctions (tight
junctions, adherens junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes),
a feature which is often conserved in epithelial cancers in situ
and in cancer cell lines (5). Epithelial junctions are composed of
adhesive dimers consisting of cadherin molecules derived from
2 neighboring cells (6). Desmoglein 2 (DSG2), an epithelial
catherin, is overexpressed in a series of epithelial malignancies,
including breast cancer (ref. 7; Supplementary Fig. S1), ovarian
cancer (ref. 7; Supplementary Fig. S1), lung cancer (7), gastric
cancer (8), squamous cell carcinomas (9), melanoma (10),
metastatic prostate cancer (11), and bladder cancer (12).
Recently, we showed that a group of human adenoviruses
(Ads; Ad serotype 3, 7, 11, and 14) use DSG2 as a primary
attachment receptor for the infection of cells (7). Importantly,
in epithelial cells, Ad3 binding to DSG2 triggered activation of
signaling pathways resulting in the transient opening of epithelial junctions (7). The opening of the epithelial junctions
was also achieved with recombinant subviral particles, such as
Ad3 penton-dodecahedra (PtDd; Fig. 1A). We subsequently
generated a minimal Ad3-derived DSG2 ligand formed by 2
ﬁber knob domains (13). This protein, with a molecular weight
of approximately 50 kDa, is produced in E. coli and can be easily
puriﬁed. In a series of functional studies, we showed that this
protein efﬁciently triggers the opening of junction. In the
following study, we therefore refer to this protein as junction
opener-1 (JO-1).

In this study, we have partially delineated the in vivo
mechanism of JO-1–mediated junction opening. Furthermore,
we show that JO-1 treatment greatly increases the permeation
of mAbs in tumors and signiﬁcantly enhances the efﬁcacy of
trastuzumab and cetuximab therapy in a series of xenograft
tumor models.

Material and Methods
Proteins
JO-1 (also known as Ad3-K/S/Kn) is produced in E. coli as
described previously (13). Recombinant Ad3 PtDd protein
complexes were produced in insect cells and puriﬁed as
described elsewhere (14).
Cell lines
BT474-M1 is a tumorigenic subclone of BT474 (ATTC,
HTB-20) that was generously provided by Mien-Chie Hung
(Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston) in 2009 (15).
BT474-M1 and HCC1954 cells (ATTC, CRL-2338) were
cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and
L-Glutamine. A549 (ATCC, CCL-185) and T84 (ATCC,
CCL-248) were cultured in DMEM/F:12 with 10% FBS, 1%
Pen/Strep and L-Glutamine. To achieve cell polarization, 1.4
 105 T84 cells were cultured in collagen-coated 6.5 mm
Transwell inserts (0.4 mm pore size; Costar Transwell
Clears) for a period of 14 to 20 days until transepithelial
resistance was stable (7). Cell lines from the ATTC were
obtained in December 2010. All cell lines have been passaged
for fewer than 6 months. Cell surface expression of Her2/
neu (BT474-M1, HCC1954) and/or EGFR1 (A549, T84)
was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence analysis in January
2011.
Immunoﬂuorescence analyses were done as described
recently (7).
Western blots were done as described recently (7).
Transepithelial electrical resistance and PEG
permeability assays
A total of 5  105 T84 cells were seeded on 12 mm
transwell inserts (PET membrane, with 0.4 mm pore size)
and cultured for 20 days. Culture medium was changed
every 2 to 3 days. The cells were exposed to DSG2 ligands
(20 mg/mL) in adhesion medium (DMEM, 1% FBS, 2 mmol/L
MgCl2, 20 mmol/L HEPES) for 15 minutes at room temperature and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was
measured and calculated as described elsewhere (16). For
permeability assays 15 minutes after adding the DSG2
ligands, 1 mCi of [14C] polyethylene glycol-4000 (PEG4000; Perkin Elmer) was added to the inner chamber. Medium aliquots were harvested from the inner and outer
chambers and measured by a scintillation counter. Permeability was calculated as described elsewhere (17).
Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done as
described previously (13).

Hematopoietic stem cell–based relaxin expression
The protocol has been described elsewhere (18). Brieﬂy,
transplant recipients were 6- to 10 weeks old, female CB17
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)-beige mice, sublethally irradiated with 350 cGy immediately before tail vein
injection with 6  105 lentivirus vector—transduced bone
marrow cells from 5-FU—treated mice. After engraftment of
cells in the recipients' bone marrow was conﬁrmed, a total of
4  106 HCC1954 were injected into the mammary fat pad.
The lentivirus vector expressing relaxin under the control of
doxycycline (Dox) has been described previously (18).
Human IgG (Herceptin) ELISA
A polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody (G-101-C-ABS,
R&D Systems) was used as a capture antibody. Tissues were
lysed as for Western blots. Puriﬁed human IgG served as a
standard. Binding was detected with a mouse monoclonal antihuman IgG1 Fc antibody (MAB 110, R&D Systems), followed by
an anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate.
Animal studies
Breast cancer xenografts were established by injecting 4 
106 cancer cells into the mammary fat pad of CB17 SCID-beige
mice. Trastuzumab was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at
a dose of 10 mg/kg. PtDd or JO-1 was given i.v. at a dose of
2 mg/kg. Tumor volumes were measured as described previously (19). Mice were sacriﬁced when the tumor volume
reached 1,000 mm3 or ulcerated. Lung cancer xenografts were
established by injecting 4  106 A549 s.c. into the right ﬂank of
CB17 SCID-beige mice. Cetuximab was injected at 10 mg/kg i.p.
For the disseminated lung tumor model, mice were intravenously injected with 2  106 A549 cells. Animals were sacriﬁced
when the ﬁrst mouse of the control group was moribund. India
ink (15% in PBS) was injected intratracheally prior to the
removal of the lungs.
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean  SD. Student t test or 2way ANOVA for multiple testing, were applied when applicable.
A value P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
JO-1 triggers opening of epithelial junctions
As the large size of Ad3 or PtDd particles can affect their
egress from blood vessels and tissue penetration, we attempted
to generate smaller Ad3-derived DSG2 ligands that are functionally active as epithelial junction openers. We therefore
designed JO-1 (aka Ad3-K/S/Kn; ref. 13), a small, self-dimerizing Ad3 ﬁber derivative (Figs. 1A and B; ref. 13). JO-1 has a
molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa and is produced in
E. coli prior to puriﬁcation by afﬁnity chromatography. In
contrast, PtDd have to be produced in insect cells and have
a molecular weight of 4,860 kDa and a diameter of approximately 50 nm.
The functional activity of JO-1 was tested on polarized colon
cancer T84 cells. Incubation of T84 cells with JO-1 triggered
remodeling of epithelial junctions, as shown by confocal

JO-1 triggers intracellular signaling and increases
penetration of mAb in epithelial tumors in vivo
An orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model (HCC1954)
was used to study the effect of JO-1 on epithelial junctions in
vivo. HCC1954 xenograft tumors resembled the histology of
breast cancer in humans (20), that is, tumors were vascularized
and contained nests of epithelial cells glued together by
epithelial junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrixes
(Supplementary Fig. S2). JO-1 was injected intravenously into

junctions. Finally, transient opening of junction was conﬁrmed
by measuring the TEER in polarized epithelial cells (Fig. 1F).
Notably, JO-1 had no signiﬁcant effect on the TEER when
studies were done in subconﬂuent cell cultures where mature
junction had not yet formed (i.e., when TEER was not
constant).

tight junctions, which are localized apical to the desmosomal
and adherence junctions, is illustrated by electron microscopy
(Fig. 1D). Microphotographs of untreated epithelial cells show
intact tight junctions as judged by the exclusion of the apically
applied electrone-dense dye ruthenium red from basolateral
space. Incubation of epithelial cells with JO-1 for 1 hour
resulted in the disassembly of tight junctions and leakage of
ruthenium red into the basolateral space (Fig. 1D, right panel).
Exposure of polarized epithelial cells to JO-1 also increased the
transepithelial permeability, as shown by transﬂux of 14C-PEG4000 with a molecular weight of 4,000 Da (Fig. 1E). Importantly,
monoclonal antibodies against different regions of the extracellular domain of DSG2 did not signiﬁcantly increase transepithelial permeability. We speculate that the ligation of several
DSG2 molecules is required to trigger the opening of the

mice with preestablished tumors. JO-1 could be detected in the
tumors by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy as early as 1 hour
postinjection. JO-1 accumulated in the tumors as is indicated
by the increased immunoﬂuorescence at 12 hours postinjection (Fig. 2A, left 3 panels). This is also conﬁrmed by Western
blot analysis of tumor lysates (Fig. 2A, right panel). Analysis of
DSG2 on tumor sections by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
in PBS-treated animals showed membrane localized signals
(Fig. 2B, left panel). One hour subsequent to JO-1 injection,
DSG2 molecules were mostly found in the cytoplasm of the
tumor cells (second panel). By 12 hours membrane localization
of DSG2 seemed to be partly restored (third panel). Western
blot analysis using anti-DSG2 antibodies against the extracellular domain of DSG2 revealed smaller fragments of the DSG2
(80 and 45 kDa) at the 1 hour time point (Fig. 2B, right panel).
These fragments represent the extracellular domains (ECD)
and proteolytic cleavage products of the ECD. Proteolytic
cleavage of DSG2 to stable fragments in normal epithelial
tissue and cancer has been reported before (21–23).
Recently, it was found in in vitro studies that Ad3 binding to
DSG2 of epithelial cells triggered intracellular signaling including pathways that are involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT; 7). Among the feature that characterize EMT
are decreased expression of epithelial markers and activation
of Erk1/2 (MAPK; 5). In our studies with xenograft tumors, we
found less nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of
E-cadherin in tumors 12 hours after intravenous injection of
JO-1 (Fig. 2C, left panel). Preceding the changes in E-cadherin,
was a transient increase in phosphorylated Erk1/2 [Fig. 2C,

compare pErk1/2 PBS vs. JO-1 (1 hour)]. The decrease in Ecadherin and an increase in signals for phosphorylated Erk1/2
upon JO-1 injection were also observed by immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy (Fig. 2C, right panels). These studies indicate that
JO-1 triggers transient activation of Erk1/2 pathways in vivo.
Next, we tested whether JO-1-triggered opening of epithelial
junctions in tumors would increase the penetration of mAbs in
xenograft tumors. Trastuzumab, a humanized IgG1 mAb, was
injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg into HCC1954
tumor-bearing mice (24). In tumor sections and Western blot
analyses, trastuzumab was detectable 1 hour postinjection and
at higher levels 12 hours after injection (Fig. 3A and B).
Quantitative analysis of human IgG1 in tumor lysates by ELISA
showed approximately 6 fold higher levels in mice that received
JO-1 injection þ trastuzumab (12 hours time point) compared
with mice that received trastuzumab alone (Fig. 3C).
In conclusion, intravenous injection of JO-1 1 hour prior to
the administration of trastuzumab, signiﬁcantly increased the
amount of trastuzumab in the tumors, indicating either better
egress from blood vessels, better intratumoral penetration,
and/or longer intratumoral half-life.

HCC1954s (Supplementary Fig. S3) with JO-1 changed the
composition of the lateral epithelial junctions within 1 hour.
As a result of this, Her2/neu staining at the cell surface became
more intense, while it faded in areas distal of the cell surface.
This suggests that JO-1 mediated junction opening triggered a
translocation of Her2/neu from lateral membranes to the cell
surface. Being trapped in epithelial junctions also seems to be a
problem for EGFR as costaining for EGFR and the tight junction
protein E-cadherin suggests (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S3B). In
our studies with cetuximab, we focused on a lung cancer model
(A549 cells), as most colon cancer cell lines have mutations in Kras, which confers resistance to cetuximab (25). Similar to what
we observed for Her2/neu, incubation of A549 cells with JO-1
resulted in a translocation of EGFR to the cell surface.
Release of mAb receptors from trapping is supported by the
enhanced killing of cancer cells by trastuzumab and cetuximab. In vitro killing of BT474 breast cancer and A549 lung
cancer cells by trastuzumab and cetuximab, respectively, was
inefﬁcient (Fig. 4C and D). Pretreatment of these cells with JO-1
signiﬁcantly increased in vitro cytotoxicity of both antibodies
in the corresponding cell lines, although the effect of JO-1 was
relatively modest.

JO-1 improves trastuzumab therapy in vivo
JO-1's potential enhancement of trastuzumab therapy was
ﬁrst tested in an orthotopic breast cancer model based on
Her2/neu positive BT474-M1 cells. JO-1 injection alone had no
signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth (Fig. 5A). BT474-M1 tumors
initially responded well to trastuzumab, however, preinjection
of JO-1 signiﬁcantly enhanced the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
trastuzumab (Fig. 5A). The enhancing effect of JO-1 pretreatment becomes more apparent when treated mice were followed long term, that, for 136 days. Although 60% of the
animals that received trastuzumab monotherapy relapsed
around day 100, none of the animals treated with JO1þtrastuzumab showed tumor regrowth (data not shown).
A second breast cancer model involved HCC1954 cells.
Tumors derived from these cells are more resistant to trastuzmab (Fig. 5B). As seen in the BT474-M1 model, JO-1
pretreatment signiﬁcantly improved trastuzumab therapy and
stalled tumor growth. On the basis of our previous study with
PtDd (7), we chose a time interval of 10 hours between JO-1 and
trastuzumab injections. This regimen is supported by the
kinetics of JO-1 accumulation in tumors and the kinetics of
E-cadherin decrease (see Fig. 2A and C). On the other hand,

events that seem to be linked to junction opening, that is, DSG2
cleavage or Erk1/2 activation, occur already within 1 hour after
JO-1 injections. We therefore investigated how simultaneous
JO-1/trastuzumab injection and injection of trastuzumab 1
hour after JO-1 application inﬂuenced the therapeutic outcome (Fig. 5C). In this study, no signiﬁcant difference was
found when compared with the treatment approach used
initially (trastuzumab 10 hours after JO-1). We speculate that
this is due to the relative slow accumulation of the protein in
the tumors. To further consolidate the clinical relevance of JO-1
as a cotherapeutic for trastuzumab, we conducted efﬁcacy
studies in Her2/neu-positive gastric cancer (NCI-N87) and
ovarian cancer (SKOV3-1ip) models (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Similar to the breast cancer model, we found costaining of
Her2/neu and claudin 7 in NCI-N87 cultures and xenografted
tumors, suggesting trapping of Her2/neu in epithelial junctions. Pretreatment of NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice with JO-1
signiﬁcantly improved trastuzumab therapy as reﬂected by
delayed tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S4A). To establish
the ovarian cancer model, SKOV3-1ip, cells were injected
intraperitoneally and survival was monitored after treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Although all mice treated with
trastuzumab alone had reached the endpoint by day 80, 80%
of the animals that received the combination treatment JO-1
plus trastuzumab were still alive at this time.

JO-1 improves cetuximab therapy in vivo
Cetuximab treatment of mice with preestablished subcutaneous A549 tumors did not result in a signiﬁcant delay of tumor
growth when compared with treatment with PBS (Fig. 6A). JO-1
was injected intravenously or intraperitoneally followed by
cetuximab 12 hours later. Both treatment approaches had a
signiﬁcant therapeutic effect and resulted in a decrease of
tumor volumes. An additional combination of intravenously
injected JO-1 with an intratumoral application of the junction
opener did not further increase the therapeutic efﬁcacy. As
seen in the breast cancer model, JO-1 treatment alone did not
exert a signiﬁcant antitumor effect. JO-1 pretreatment
enhanced cetuximab therapy to a similar degree as seen with
PtDd (Fig. 6B).
Next, the cotherapy approach was tested in a metastatic lung
cancer model. In this model, mice became morbid within 37
days of tumor cell transplantation with predominant tumor
localization to the lung (Fig. 6C, "PBS" group). Treatment of
mice was started at day 10. All animals were sacriﬁced at day
40. Although lung metastases were clearly visible in the control
group, JO-1 group, and the cetuximab-treated animals, 80% of
the lungs in the JO-1þcetuximab-treated animals were free of
tumor when inspected macroscopically. Microscopy of lung
sections showed that in PBS-treated animals, tumor cells
almost completely replaced normal lung tissue and also ﬁlled

Dox-inducible transcription cassette, and the transplantation of these cells into myelo-conditioned recipients, where
they engraft in the bone marrow and provide a long-term
source of genetically modiﬁed cells that will home into
tumors. This study showed that relaxin expression alone
signiﬁcantly delayed tumor growth and increased trastuzumab therapy (Fig. 7B). The combination of relaxin expression and JO-1 treatment stopped tumor growth. Tumors did
not regrow when treatment was terminated, in contrast to
groups that received either relaxinþtrastuzmab or JO1þtrastuzumab therapy. Histologic analyses of residual
masses in the JO-1/relaxin/trastuzumab group at the end
of the observation period, showed only connective tissue. In
contrast, explanted tumors from the other groups contained
tumor cells, which could be cultured in vitro upon protease
digestion of tumors. Notably, no adverse side effects were
observed in mice that received the triple combination (JO-1/
relaxin/trastuzumab) treatment.
Our data underscore that physical obstacles in tumors are
involved in mediating resistance to trastuzumab therapy.

recombinant protein JO-1 increased the penetration of
trastuzumab in the tumor and allowed for better access to
mAb target receptors, which, in turn, facilitated mAb therapy in a series of xenograft models involving human epithelial tumor cells. Potentially, the combination of JO-1 with
trastuzumab and cetuximab might allow for the reduction
of the effective dose of these mAbs, thereby reducing critical
side effects, that is, trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxity
and acne-like rashes that often occur during cetuximab
therapy.
Mechanisms of action
Our data suggest that JO-1 triggers junction opening in
epithelial tumors through several, potentially connected,
mechanisms: (i) cleavage of the DSG2 ECD, and disruption of
DSG2 dimers between neighboring cells; (ii) intracellular signaling that leads to a transient decrease of E-cadherin and
potentially other junction proteins; and (iii) changes in the
membrane distribution of Her2/neu. JO-1 treatment resulted in
transient phosphorylation of Her2/neu in tumors (Supplementay Fig. S5). However, trastuzumab treatment alone also triggered Her2/neu phosphorylation, a phenomenon that has been
observed before (27), and JO-1 plus trastuzumab cotherapy did
not further increase the levels of phosphorylated Her2/neu.
This makes it unlikely that JO-1 enhances trastuzumab therapy
through its effect on the biology of Her2/neu.

Cotherapeutic for Anticancer mAbs

Side effects on normal epithelial tissues
Because the mouse orthologue of DSG2 is not recognized by
Ad3 or JO-1 (7), we generated transgenic mice containing the
human DSG2 locus. The expression pattern and level of human
DSG2 in these animals were similar to those found in humans.
Furthermore, we showed that JO-1 binding to human DSG2 in
transgenic mouse epithelial cells triggered junction opening to
a degree similar to data observed in human cells. In preliminary
studies with DSG2-transgenic mice we did not ﬁnd critical side
effects of intravenous JO-1 injection (2 mg/kg; 28). We speculate that DSG2 in normal epithelial cells is not readily
accessible to intravenously applied JO-1. On the other hand,
greater leakage of tumor-associated blood vessels and the lack
of strict cell polarization might make epithelial tumors more
responsive to JO-1. Lack of toxicity after intravenous injection
of JO-1 ligands is also underscored by studies with adenoviruses containing Ad3 ﬁbers (29).
JO-1 immunogenicity
As JO-1 is a viral protein, adaptive immune responses might
develop in humans, particularly after repeated injection. This
might, however, not be a problem clinically because both
trastuzumab and cetuximab are used in combination with
immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic drugs.
Potential risk to enhance tumor invasion and metastasis
In agreement with other studies (8, 9), we found a higher
DSG2 expression in malignant tissues than in the surrounding
normal epithelial tissue. There are, however, also studies
reporting a reduction in the amounts of DSG2 in invasive
pancreatic or gastric cancer (23, 30). The latter, and the ﬁnding
that JO-1 triggers EMT-like signaling, raises the question of

whether JO-1 would facilitate metastasis. Notably, in all models
used in this study, we did not see stimulation of tumor growth
or macroscopic/microscopic signs of metastasis in animals
treated with JO-1 alone. Tumor invasion and metastasis
requires more than transient activation of EMT pathways.
Detachment from epithelial cancers and migration of tumor
cells is only possible after long-term crosstalk between malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment, resulting in
changes in the tumor stroma and phenotypic reprogramming
of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells (31).
In summary, the epithelial junction opener JO-1 has the
potential to improve mAb therapies of cancer both in terms of
efﬁcacy and safety, that is, by allowing lower therapeutic mAbs
doses. This study also sheds light on the mechanisms of Ad3
infection of epithelial cells.

Correction: Epithelial Junction Opener JO-1
Improves Monoclonal Antibody Therapy of
Cancer
In this article (Cancer Res 2011;71:7080–90), which was published in the November
15, 2011, issue of Cancer Research (1), there is an error in Fig. 3A. The panel
"trastuzumab (1 h p.i.)" was inadvertently duplicated and appeared as panel
"trastuzumab (12 h p.i.)." The correct version of Fig. 3A appears below. Furthermore,
in the legend of Fig. 3A, "Positive staining seems green" should read "Positive
staining appears in light gray." The authors regret this error.
