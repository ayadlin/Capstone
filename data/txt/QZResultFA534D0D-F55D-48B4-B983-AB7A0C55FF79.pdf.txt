Abstract
Ets-related gene (ERG) is a member of the ETS transcription
factor gene family located on Hsa21. ERG is known to have a
crucial role in establishing definitive hematopoiesis and is
required for normal megakaryopoiesis. Truncated forms of
ERG are associated with multiple cancers such as Ewing’s
sarcoma, prostate cancer, and leukemia as part of oncogenic
fusion translocations. Increased expression of ERG is highly
indicative of poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and
ERG is expressed in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL);
however, it is unclear if expression of ERG per se has a
leukemogenic activity. We show that ectopic expression of
ERG in fetal hematopoietic progenitors promotes megakaryopoiesis and that ERG alone acts as a potent oncogene in vivo
leading to rapid onset of leukemia in mice. We observe that
the endogenous ERG is required for the proliferation and
maintenance of AMKL cell lines. ERG also strongly cooperates
with the GATA1s mutated protein, found in Down syndrome
AMKL, to immortalize megakaryocyte progenitors, suggesting
that the additional copy of ERG in trisomy 21 may have a role
in Down syndrome AMKL. These data suggest that ERG is a
hematopoietic oncogene that may play a direct role in myeloid
leukemia pathogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4665–73]

Introduction
Ets-related gene (ERG) is a member of the ETS transcription
factor gene family and is closely related to another ETS family
member, FLI-1. There are at least five splice isoforms of ERG mRNA
(1) and our previous study identified ERG-3 as the main
hematopoietic ERG isoform (2). FLI-1 is required for normal
megakaryopoiesis (3) and ERG has recently also been shown to
have an essential role in establishing normal megakaryopoiesis (4).
The mice harboring a missense mutation in ERG have also revealed
the requirement for ERG to establish definitive hematopoiesis and
for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. ERG has been associated
with multiple cancers. It is rearranged in 5% to 10% of patients
with Ewing’s sarcoma, where it is fused to EWS to create chimeric

oncogenic protein (5) and is fused with TMPRSS2 in a large
proportion of prostate cancers (6). An ERG fusion gene, TLS-ERG,
has been found in some cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
(AMKL; refs. 7, 8). In both EWS-ERG and TLS-ERG, the fusion
protein contains a truncated form of ERG that retains the ETS
domain. A truncated form of ERG has also been found in some
cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (9), suggesting a
possible role in leukemogenesis. Increased expression of ERG
characterizes a subset of myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype
(10), and a high expression level of ERG in cytogenetically normal
acute myeloid leukemia is associated with poor prognosis (11).
Although these data imply that ERG might be a hematopoietic
oncogene, no explicit evidence for this has thus far been shown.
ERG is located on Hsa21 and children ages <4 years with germline trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have a 500-fold increased risk for
AMKL (12). Somatic mutations acquired during fetal hematopoiesis in the GATA1 transcription factor are detected in megakaryoblasts from almost all the Down syndrome patients with AMKL
(13–15), leading to the replacement of full-length GATA1 by a
shorter isoform, GATA1s (13–15). The GATA1 mutation alone is
insufficient for leukemogenesis because GATA1s causes transient
proliferation of immature fetal megakaryocytic progenitors but no
postnatal hematopoietic abnormalities (16) and individuals with
germ-line GATA1s show no reported malignancies (17), strongly
suggesting that trisomy 21 is essential for leukemic development.
Therefore, it has been proposed that overexpression of one or more
genes on chromosome 21 (Hsa21) may have a crucial role in the
leukemogenic transformation of megakaryoblasts (2, 18, 19). ERG is
a potential candidate gene, as it has been shown to be expressed in
both Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome AMKL patient
samples (2) and to be required for megakaryopoiesis (2, 4).
Therefore, we wished to establish if ERG could act as an
oncogene in myeloid leukemia and if the elevated expression of
ERG in AMKL has functional significance. Combining ectopic
expression experiments in fetal hematopoietic progenitors and
RNA interference in AMKL cell lines, we show, for the first time,
that full-length ERG is a myeloid oncogene. We also show that ERG
strongly cooperates with GATA1s to immortalize megakaryocyte
progenitors in colony-forming assays, suggesting a potential role in
Down syndrome AMKL pathogenesis.

maintained in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Retroviral constructs. The pMSCV-Gata1 and pMSCV-Gata1s retroviral
vectors were generated by subcloning the FLAG-tagged murine Gata1 and
Gata1s cDNA fragments into a modified version of pMSCV-neo (BD
Clontech) upstream of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and neoR
gene. The pMSCV-ERG retroviral construct was generated by cloning the
human ERG-3 (hematopoietic isoform of ERG) cDNA into Eco RI sites of the
pMSCV-IRES-hCD2 vector constructed by modifying pMSCV-neo. The
phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and neomycin resistance cassette was
replaced by an internal ribosome entry site and truncated human CD2
cassette amplified by PCR from the pMI-IRES-hCD2 vector (gift from
Dr. M.J. Bevan, Department of Immunology, University of Washington;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). The expression of each protein from this vector
was confirmed by immunoblotting of LinXE-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Real-time quantitative PCR. RNA was isolated from immortalized cell
line or from the spleen of two independent ERG or ERG + GATA1s leukemic
mice using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated using MMLV reverse transcriptase, amplification
grade DNase I, random primers, RNaseOUT, and dinucleotide triphosphates
(all from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
quantitative PCR was done using TaqMan probe-based chemistry and an
ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
Expression levels of CD41 (Mm00439741), CD42 (Mm00497671_g1), and
platelet factor 4 (PF4; Mm00451315_g1) were normalized to glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mm99999915_g1) expression. The 2-DDCT
relative quantitation method was used to determine the relative expression
level. All primer/probe sets were from Applied Biosystems.
RNA interference and transduction of cell lines. Virus-mediated RNA
interference was accomplished using the pRetroSuper construct. To
generate pRetroSuper targeting human ERG, pRetroSuper was digested
with Bgl II and Hind III and the annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into
the vector. The 19-bp ERG target sequence is ATGCGCATCTCTTTCTTTG,
and as control, a nontargeting sequence TCCAACACGACACTCACTA was
used. The nontargeting sequence is not similar to any sequence revealed by
BLAST search. 293T cells were transiently transfected with pRetroSuperControl or pRetroSuper-ERG retroviral plasmids in combination with
expression vectors coding for the Gag, Pol, and Env proteins. The culture
medium was filtered through a 0.45 Am filter 48 h post-transfection, and the
viral supernatant was used for infection of either Meg01 or CMY cells in the
presence of 8 Ag/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were doubly
infected with a 24 h interval and allowed to recover for a further 48 h before
selection. Transduced cells were selected for 3 weeks with 10 Ag/mL
puromycin (ant-pr-1; InvivoGen) for Meg01 cells and 1.5 Ag/mL for CMY
cells. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of megakaryocytic markers was
done as described previously (2).
Transduction of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Hematopoietic
progenitor cells (HPC) were harvested from embryonic day 12.5 fetal liver
of C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell suspensions were prepared. Monoclonal
antibodies specific to c-Kit (2B8; BD Pharmingen) and Ter119 (BD
Biosciences) were used to purify progenitor cells. The purification was
carried out using a magnetic activated cell sorter (Miltenyi Biotech)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated HPCs were cultured
overnight in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF),
10 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3, 10 ng/mL IL-6 (PeproTech), and 50 mmol/L 2mercaptoethanol. Retroviral supernatant was produced by transfecting the
LinXE ecotropic retrovirus packaging cell line with retroviral vectors.
Supernatant was harvested after 48 h and concentrated 8-fold by
centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000  g. The viral supernatant was used to
transduce the purified c-Kit+Ter119- HPCs by spinoculation (centrifugation
at 700  g, 25 C, 45 min) in the presence of 100 ng/mL SCF, 10 ng/mL IL-3,
10 ng/mL IL-6 (PeproTech), and 5 mg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich).
Transduced HPCs were cultured with the same cytokine conditions for
24 h and subsequently used for colony-forming assays.

cultures in 35 mm plates. For megakaryocytic colony assays, cells were
plated in Methocult 3234 (Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with
50 ng/mL thrombopoietin (Research and Diagnostics) and 100 ng/mL SCF
or Methocult containing 50 ng/mL thrombopoietin, 100 ng/mL SCF, and
10 ng/mL IL-3 in the presence of 1 mg/mL G418 (Life Technologies). Cells
were cultured at 37jC for 6 to 10 days after which colonies were scored and
cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Colonies were stained
with 1 mg/mL p-iodonitrotetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. The colonies
were scanned on GS-800 calibrated densitometer machine (Bio-Rad)
48 h following staining. Single-cell suspensions were serially replated in
methylcellulose medium supplemented with the same growth factors
without G418. Cell lines were established by picking single colonies
following the third round of plating and propagation in DMEM liquid
medium containing 10% FCS, L-glutamine, and 50 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of thrombopoietin, and SCF or thrombopoietin, SCF,
and IL-3. The ERG immortalized cell lines were maintained in 100 ng/mL
SCF, 50 ng/mL thrombopoietin, and 10 ng/mL IL-3. The ERG + GATA1s
immortalized cell lines were maintained in 100 ng/mL SCF and 50 ng/mL
thrombopoietin.
In vivo leukemogenesis assay. HPCs (2  105-3  105) transduced with
empty vector, ERG alone, GATA1s alone, or ERG + GATA1s retroviruses
were intravenously injected into sublethally irradiated (6 Gy) C57BL/6 recipient mice 48 h after infection. Mice were sacrificed when they developed
signs of disease.
Histopathology. Murine tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin and paraffin-embedded. H&E staining was carried out on 4 Am
sections.
Immunoblotting. Protein lysates were fractionated in 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred on to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Immobilon-P; Millipore) using one transfer buffer (N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopanesulfonic acid; pH 11.0) for 5 h at 100 V. Following blocking for 5 h in 5%
skim milk-PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were probed with an antiFLAG antibody (M2; Sigma-Aldrich) or an anti-ERG antibody (C-17; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). For loading control, an anti-NPM (Zymed Labs), antiactin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-GAPDH (Chemicon) was used.
The membrane was washed twice in PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) for a further hour. The membrane was washed twice
with PBS-Tween 20 and subjected to chemiluminescence detection
(Amersham) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies to c-Kit (2B8; BD Pharmingen), CD41 (MW/Reg30;
Abcam), CD2 (LFA2; BD Pharmingen), CD61 (F0803; DAKOCytomation),
CD9 (KMC8; BD Pharmingen), and isotype control antibodies. For the
analysis of leukemic cells, red cells were lysed in ammonium chloride
solution at room temperature for 10 min before primary antibody staining.
The cells were washed in staining buffer (PBS with 0.05% sodium azide and
0.1% bovine serum albumin) and preincubated with unlabeled anti-Fc II/III
receptor monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 for 15 min on ice. Cells were stained
with monoclonal antibodies conjugated with FITC, phycoerythrin, or biotin.
Biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were detected using peridinin
chlorophyll a protein-conjugated streptavidin.

Results
ERG promotes megakaryopoiesis and immortalizes HPCs in
the presence of IL-3. We first investigated the potential role of
ERG in megakaryopoiesis by transducing HPCs derived from fetal
liver with retrovirus expressing the ERG hematopoietic isoform. We
found that progenitor cells expressing ERG could not be serially
replated in the presence of thrombopoietin and SCF, which
synergize to enhance growth of murine megakaryocyte colonies
(ref. 20; Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, we found that ERGtransduced HPCs could be serially replated in the presence of
thrombopoietin, SCF, and IL-3 (Fig. 1A). IL-3 supports megakaryocytic colony formation and synergizes with thrombopoietin to

there was a dramatic difference in the morphology of the colonies

differentiation such as CD41, CD42 (a marker of more mature
megakaryocytes), and PF4. The relative mRNA expression was
normalized to untransduced HPCs. These data show that ERG can
promote megakaryopoiesis and immortalize early HPCs.
ERG induces megakaryoblastic leukemia in mice. Having
established cell lines with a megakaryocytic phenotype, we
examined the leukemogenic potential of ERG in vivo. HPCs
transduced with ERG or vector control were transplanted into
sublethally irradiated syngeneic mice 48 h after transduction. The
transduction efficiency of the HPCs was f90% as assessed by
human CD2 expression (Fig. 2A) because ERG and CD2 were
coexpressed by retroviral vector (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Mice

transplanted with control cells remained healthy, but all recipient
mice transplanted with cells expressing ERG succumbed to
leukemia within 100 days, the majority in <50 days (Fig. 2A). The
ERG mice exhibited profound splenomegaly and histologic
examination showed disrupted spleen architecture and heavy
infiltration of organs such as spleen, bone marrow, and liver by
leukemic cells (Fig. 2B). Because the transduced HPCs harbored
both ERG and human CD2, the CD2+ cells from the enlarged
spleens were assayed for c-Kit and CD41 expression. CD2+ spleen
cells from the ERG mice predominantly expressed CD41 and very
low levels of c-Kit, indicating a megakaryoblastic phenotype
(Fig. 2C). Wright-Giemsa staining of leukemic cells from bone

marrow and spleen showed the presence of cells with characteristic
blast-like phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S3). Immunoblotting of
spleen cells from ERG mice confirmed the expression of ERG
(Fig. 2D). The data show that ERG can act as a potent oncogene
and induces megakaryoblastic leukemia in vivo.
ERG is required for megakaryocytic differentiation and
growth of AMKL-derived cell lines. We have previously shown
the expression of ERG in both Down syndrome and non-Down
syndrome AMKLs (2). To determine the role of ‘‘endogenous’’ ERG
in AMKL, we generated an ERG knockdown retroviral construct
targeting the 3¶-untranslated region of all the ERG isoforms.
Knockdown of ERG was evident in protein analysis of leukemic cell
lines derived from non-Down syndrome AMKL (Meg01; harboring
wild-type GATA1) and Down syndrome AMKL (CMY; harboring the
GATA1s mutation) following transduction with a retrovirus
expressing small interfering RNA that targets ERG (Fig. 3A). Realtime PCR analysis revealed a reduction in the expression of
megakaryocytic differentiation genes GP2B (CD41) and GP3A
(CD61) in both Meg01 and CMY cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Similarly, CD41 and CD61 expression levels were significantly
reduced in cells when ERG expression was knocked down
compared with cells transduced by retrovirus expressing a
nonspecific small interfering RNA (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, ERG
knockdown led to a significant growth reduction in both AMKL cell

lines (Fig. 3C; P < 0.001). These results show that endogenous
expression of ERG in both Down syndrome and non-Down
syndrome AMKL cell lines enhances growth and the expression
of genes that define megakaryocytic differentiation.
ERG collaborates with GATA1s to immortalize murine
HPCs. As ERG is located on chromosome 21 and after having
established that ERG is a megakaryoblastic oncogene, we
hypothesized that ERG might cooperate with the GATA1s mutated
protein, which has a clear initiating role in Down syndrome AMKL.
This hypothesis is supported by the effects of knocking down ERG
in the Down syndrome AMKL CMY cell line. To determine if
coexpression of GATA1s and ERG would be sufficient to immortalize HPCs, we decided to apply a highly stringent criterion for
megakaryocytic colony-forming assay using only thrombopoietin
and SCF, which in themselves were insufficient to support
hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization by ERG alone
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Based on the study by Li and colleagues.
(16), we hypothesized that GATA1s has a dominant activity even
when expressed on a background of wild-type GATA1. Data from
the same study showed that embryonic day 12.5 fetal liver contains
a significant fraction of GATA1s-responsive hyperproliferative
megakaryocytic precursors, which diminishes very rapidly at later
days in embryonic development (16). Therefore, we set up colonyforming assays using retrovirally transduced embryonic day 12.5

fetal liver HPCs in the presence of thrombopoietin and SCF. HPCs
transduced with GATA1s or ERG individually produced only small
numbers of colonies and very few cells. Cells cotransduced by ERG
and the full-length GATA1 failed to divide after the second round of
plating. However, HPCs coexpressing ERG and GATA1s produced
large numbers of colonies, which could be continuously replated in
methylcellulose (Fig. 4A). The increased number of colonies formed
by cells expressing ERG and GATA1s was shown by staining of
cultures with p-iodonitrotetrazolium at each round of plating
(Fig. 4B ). The ability of leukemia-associated oncogenes to

immortalize HPCs is directly assessed using colony-forming cell
assays in methylcellulose (22). Single colonies of cells coexpressing
ERG and GATA1s were transferred from methylcellulose into liquid
culture containing thrombopoietin and SCF and these cells
expanded and divided continuously over an extended time course
(Fig. 4C). Flow cytometry showed that the ERG and GATA1s
immortalized cells had a characteristic megakaryoblastic phenotype expressing high levels of c-Kit and CD41 (Fig. 4D). By contrast,
cells transduced with vector alone did not express the megakaryocytic marker CD41 (data not shown). ERG and GATA1s

immortalized cells also express high levels of CD9, an early-stage
megakaryoblast marker (23). The data suggest a classic oncogenic
cooperativity (24, 25) between GATA1s and ERG that immortalizes
megakaryoblasts analogous to the megakaryoblastic leukemia cells
found in Down syndrome AMKL.
To determine the consequences of ERG and GATA1s cooperativity in vivo, we transplanted HPCs cotransduced with both ERGand GATA1s-expressing retroviruses into sublethally irradiated
syngeneic mice. HPCs purified from embryonic day 12.5 fetal liver
were transduced with GATA1s alone, ERG and GATA1s, or empty
vector and cells were transplanted into syngeneic mice 48 h posttransduction (data not shown). Mice transplanted with HPCs
expressing GATA1s alone or empty vector remained healthy. Cells
expressing ERG + GATA1s induced leukemia (Fig. 5A), with similar
latency to that found for mice transplanted with HPCs expressing
ERG alone. Similarly to the ERG mice, the ERG + GATA1s mice had
severe splenomegaly (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and histology
examination showed a marked disruption in the normal architecture of the spleen and extensive infiltration into bone marrow and
liver (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Immunoblotting of spleen cells
from ERG + GATA1s mice shows high-level coexpression of both
retrovirally transduced ERG and FLAG-tagged GATA1s (Fig. 5B).
As above, each leukemic cell harbored the ERG retrovirus and
therefore coexpressed hCD2. The c-Kit and CD41 expression within
the CD2+ population of ERG + GATA1s leukemias was assayed
(Fig. 5C). These leukemias consisted of heterogeneous populations
of cells, with most mice exhibiting cells that are predominantly
c-Kit positive. In comparison with cells from ERG mice, the CD2+
leukemic cells in ERG + GATA1s mice had significantly reduced
expression of CD41 (Fig. 6A) but no significant difference in
expression levels of c-Kit (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, real-time PCR
analysis of leukemic spleens from ERG versus ERG + GATA1s mice
showed a significant decrease in expression of the CD41, CD42, and
PF4 genes associated with megakaryocytic maturation (Fig. 6C).
Southern blotting showed that all the leukemias harbored multiple
integrations and were oligoclonal. These data suggest that the ERG
and GATA1s leukemias appear less differentiated than those
induced by ERG alone.

Discussion
ERG involvement in cancer has been generally characterized
by fusion translocations of a NH2-terminal truncated ERG (5, 6,
26, 27). Increased expression of full-length ERG has been
observed in patients with AMKL (2, 28) and found to be
associated with poor prognosis of AML (10, 11). However, it has
been unclear if this simply represents the differentiation stage of
the leukemic blasts or if ERG has a direct leukemogenic activity.
Our data show for the first time that increased expression of the
full-length ERG protein causes aggressive megakaryoblastic
leukemia in mice. Consistent with this, we find that reduction
in the expression of endogenous ERG in AMKL leads to
decreased expression of megakaryocytic markers and a decrease
in growth rate despite the presence of additional oncogenic
proteins, that is, BCR/ABL in Meg01 cells and GATA1s and likely
other abnormalities in CMY cells. Therefore, ERG is a bona fide
megakaryocytic oncogene.
Many leukemia-associated transcription factors are normally
involved in hematopoietic differentiation (29–31). We show that
ERG expression within HPCs is a strong inducer of megakaryopoiesis. Previously, we have shown that ERG binds the SCL+19

of mice injected with HPCs transduced with indicated viruses (n = 10 for vector
control, n = 5 for GATA1s, and n = 14 for ERG + GATA1s). B, Western blot
analysis of splenocytes from two independent mice that were transplanted with
cells transduced with ERG-3 + FLAG-tagged GATA1s. The presence of ERG-3
and GATA1s protein in the splenocytes of transplanted mice was detected by
using an anti-ERG and an anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. An anti-NPM
antibody was used for loading control. C, flow cytometry analysis of leukemic
splenocytes of a representative animal injected with cells coexpressing ERG +
GATA1s. The histograms show the percentage of hCD2+ cells in the spleen and
dot plots show c-Kit and CD41 expression within the hCD2+ population. The
numbers in the plot represent the percentage of c-Kit-positive and CD41+ cells.

enhancer (2) that regulates SCL/TAL1 expression in HPCs and
SCL1/TAL1 overexpression is known to force progenitor cells
toward the megakaryocytic lineage (32, 33). Our studies
combined with the recently published loss of function experiments (4) suggest that ERG may act through gene dosage effect
on processes such as megakaryocytic commitment, proliferation,
and differentiation.
Recent studies (34, 35) show that germ-line trisomy 21
markedly enhances fetal liver megakaryopoiesis. Because ERG
is a positive regulator of megakaryopoiesis, it is one of several
candidate genes that could cooperate with the somatically
acquired GATA1s mutation in the initiation of Down syndrome
AMKL. Our data show that ERG cooperates strongly with the
GATA1s mutation to immortalize fetal megakaryocytic progen-

itors in the presence of thrombopoietin and SCF. Under these
restrictive conditions, neither GATA1s nor ERG alone could
cause immortalization. This phenotype was further confirmed by
transferring single colonies from methylcellulose into liquid
culture containing thrombopoietin and SCF, where the cells
expanded and divided continuously over an extended time
course. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that these ERG +
GATA1s immortalized cells had a characteristic immature
megakaryoblastic phenotype expressing high levels of c-Kit
and CD41. ERG alone could only immortalize HPCs in the
presence of IL-3 in addition to SCF. In agreement with this,
Stankiewicz and Crispino have also found that ERG induces
megakaryopoiesis and it synergizes with GATA1s to enhance
colony formation (36).
ERG acts as a potent oncogene in vivo rapidly leading to
leukemia. The latency of the development of leukemia from HPCs
transduced with ERG was so short that it was impossible to
observe any accelerated effect due to the presence of transduced
GATA1s. However, the coexpression of ERG and GATA1s in vivo
did result in leukemias with an immature megakaryocytic
phenotype reflected in a profound decrease expression of
megakaryocyte differentiation markers such as CD41, CD42, and
PF4. This effect may be due to the ability of GATA1s to enhance
cell proliferation at the expense of differentiation (37). This
finding is also consistent with the reduced megakaryocytic
differentiation levels of Down syndrome AMKL (28) as is also
evident when comparing CMY with Meg01 cells (Fig. 3B). The
potential role for ERG in Down syndrome AMKL is suggested by
the reduced growth of CMY Down syndrome AMKL cells after

knockdown of endogenous ERG. It is likely that the level of ERG
expression in human Down syndrome fetal HPCs is lower than its
level in our mouse transplantation experiments. Hence, we
hypothesize that, in humans, the action of ERG in Down
syndrome AMKL would require the presence of GATA1s to
initiate leukemogenic expansion of megakaryoblasts observed in
congenital Down syndrome TMD. It is highly likely that several
Hsa21 genes, besides ERG, cooperate with GATA1s. Recent work
has argued against a requirement for RUNX1 (38) but has
emphasized the possible involvement of fellow ETS family
member, ETS2, in Down syndrome AMKL (36, 39). Therefore,
ERG, ETS2, and probably other Hsa21 genes overexpressed in
early fetal hematopoietic progenitors trisomic for chromosome 21
can enhance megakaryopoiesis as observed in the studies in
Down syndrome fetal livers (34, 35).
The leukemic action of ERG may also be significant for
lymphoblastic leukemias. Increased expression of ERG in T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with adverse prognosis (40) and a subgroup of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia shows overexpression of partially deleted ERG (9). Now
that we have identified the potent effects of ERG on both normal
and malignant hematopoiesis, elucidation of the components of
the ERG-mediated pathway is clearly an important avenue of
future research for both megakaryopoiesis and leukemia in
general.
