BACKGROUND: Recent experience has suggested that there has been a stepwise improvement in the survival
outcomes of patients who have follicular lymphoma with the introduction of new treatment options. In the current study, the authors report the results of 2 subsequent phase 2 trials of 238 previously untreated patients.
METHODS: In a trial of bleomycin, epidoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (BACOP)
plus fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone (FND), 144 patients received 2 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FND treatments. In a trial of BACOP plus fludarabine and rituximab (FR), 94 patients received
3 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FR treatments. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate for
BACOP/FND was 62%. After a median follow-up of 60 months, the failure-free survival (FFS) and overall
survival (OS) rates at 4 years were 53% and 77%, respectively. The CR rate for BACOP/FR was 79%. After a
median follow-up of 36 months, the FFS and OS rates at 4 years were 56% and 97%, respectively, which
were significant compared with the CR and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FND. Twenty-five of 42 bcl-2positive patients attained a molecularly negative CR and had improved FFS. No significant differences
were observed between the 2 trials in the percentage of infections or neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: The CR
and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FR were better, and overall toxicity did not increase. Furthermore,
patients who received rituximab had a better FFS compared with patients who received chemotherapy
alone. Finally, although conclusions between nonrandomized groups may depend on differences in
observed and unobserved prognostic features, the current results suggested that the addition of rituximab
to anthracycline-fludarabine–containing regimens have a favorable effect on the prognosis of patients with

BACOP-FR in Follicular Lymphoma/Luminari et al

Patients with follicular lymphoma typically have an
indolent course characterized by responsiveness to initial
therapy, followed by disease recurrence, and subsequent
remission of progressively shorter duration.1 Follicular
lymphoma often is characterized by the translocation
t(14,18), which results in the over-expression and activation of the bcl-2 gene and a subsequent inhibition of apoptosis.2 A management approach can include observation
without therapy and various treatments, including alkylating agents, anthracycline- and fludarabine-based regimens, dose intensification with stem cell support, biologic
therapies (such as interferons), and therapies that target
the CD20 antigen.1,3 Until a few years ago, there was a
general consensus that the outcome of patients with lowgrade lymphoma had not changed over the last 30 years.4
Contrasting experiences based on recent retrospective
studies have been reported, supporting a stepwise
improvement in survival outcomes with the introduction
of new treatment options over the last few years.5 At the
same time, phase 2 studies6,7 and randomized trials have
demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
(CHOP) regimen,8,9 or other anthracycline10-12 or nonanthracycline-containing regimens,13 resulted in higher
complete remission (CR) rates and better progression-free
survival rates. In the current study, we report the results of
2 subsequent phase 2 trials conducted by the Italian
Group for Lymphoma Study (GISL) between 1997 and
2006 using CHOP-like plus fludarabine regimens with or
without rituximab. These results confirm an improvement in the CR rate and better survival with the addition
of rituximab.

The BACOP/FR study was designed in 2003, when rituximab became available in Italy, through the National
Health Service. The rationale for conducting the study
was that, after a debulking with the CHOP-like regimen,
the association of fludarabine and rituximab could clear
bcl-2 better and destroy residual masses. The BACOP/
FND study registered 144 patients between 1997 and
2002, and the BACOP/FR study registered 94 patients
between 2003 and 2006. For both trials, eligible patients
had histologically documented follicular lymphoma that
was diagnosed according to Revised European-American
Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms/World Health
Organization criteria. Patients were required to be previously untreated and to have Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease. Patients with stage II disease were eligible if they
presented with B symptoms or bulky disease. Patients also
had to have measurable disease, a need for therapy in the
opinion of treating physicians, an expected survival >6
months, age 18 to 70 years, and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2. Patients
with known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis
B or C virus infection; central nervous system lymphoma;
previous malignancies; or cardiac, renal, liver, or respiratory failure were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women
and patients of childbearing potential were excluded
unless birth control measures were used. The study complied with all requirements and was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. The protocols
were approved by the institutional review board at each
participating center. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

Design of Studies and Treatment Schedules

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Entry Criteria
The 2 trials were of combined bleomycin, epidoxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (BACOP)
plus fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone
(FND) and BACOP plus fludarabine and rituximab (FR)
and were conducted at 15 GISL sites in Italy. The
BACOP/FND study, which was designed in 1997, was
based on the idea that combining a CHOP-like regimen
with a fludarabine-based chemotherapy schema could
increase the response rate and improve survival outcome.

Both trials were open-label, noncomparative, multicenter,
phase 2 studies. Briefly, in the BACOP/FND trial,
patients received BACOP chemotherapy comprised of
650 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 30 mg/m2 epidoxorubicin, and 1.4 mg/m2 vincristine on Days 1 and 8; 5 mg/m2
bleomycin on Days 15 and 22; and 100 mg/m2 prednisone daily on Days 15 through 28 every 4 weeks for 2
cycles. Then, the patients received FND chemotherapy
comprised of 25 mg/m2 fludarabine daily on Days 1
through 3, 10 mg/m2 mitoxantrone on Day 1, and 20 mg
dexamethasone daily on Days 1 through 5 every 4 weeks
for 4 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, patients who
1907

Original Article

had attained a CR or a partial response (PR) were
randomized either to undergo observation without therapy or to receive 3 MU/m2 interferon alpha (INF) every
other day plus 20 mg dexamethasone orally for 4 days every 4 weeks for 6 months. In the BACOP/FR trial,
patients received BACOP every 4 weeks for 3 cycles.
Patients who attained a CR and bcl-2 clearance did not
receive further therapy. Patients who attained a CR after 3
BACOP treatments without bcl-2 clearance, who attained
a PR irrespective of bcl-2 status, or were bcl-2 negative at
baseline received 4 sequential cycles of FR. The schema of
chemotherapy with FR was comprised of 25 mg/m2 fludarabine daily for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks for 4
cycles. A 375 mg/m2 dose of rituximab was administered
by infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. INF was not used in
the BACOP/FR trial. In both trials, at the end of chemotherapy, involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) (maximum
dose, 3500 grays) was allowed to treat residual masses or
at the site of previous bulky or extranodal disease at the
discretion of the treating physician.

Statistical Analysis
In total, 205 patients were eligible for the protocols, and
the intent-to-treat population included all eligible, enrolled patients. Clinical parameters were registered prospectively at the time of each patient’s entry into the
study. Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date
of registration until the last follow-up or death from any
cause. Failure-free survival (FFS) was calculated from the
date of registration until disease progression, recurrence,
or disease- or treatment-related death. Survival curves
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method,14 and
statistical comparisons between the baseline characteristics
of the patients and survival estimates were made using the
log-rank test.15 In addition, the Cox regression model16
was used to determine the effect of multiple variables on
OS and FSS. The proportionality of risk was determined
in all Cox regression analyses. Chi-square analysis, when
appropriate, and the Fisher exact test were used to evaluate
differences between baseline characteristics of the patients
in categorized form and the clinical response and toxicity
related to treatment. For continuous variables, the MannWhitney U test was used.17
The sample size was planned on the basis of the CR
rate, whereas we did not plan a sample size to compare the
1908

2 sequential trials for a specific endpoint. In all analyses, a
2-sided P value <.05 indicated a moderate strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also, this level of probability was helpful for detecting clinically useful findings.
The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index
(FLIPI)18 was calculated for 188 of the 205 assessable
patients (92%).

RESULTS
Demographics
Overall, the baseline clinical characteristics of the 205
patients were a median age of 55 years (range, 26-71
years), 55% of patients were men, 92% had Ann Arbor
stage III and IV disease, 29% had a FLIPI score >2, and
26% had >1 extranodal site. In Table 1, the baseline parameters are listed by trial. The only clinical characteristic
with a significant difference between the BACOP/FND
trial and the BACOP/FR trial was the age of the treated
patients. The P values related to histologic grade were not
calculated because of the high percentage of unknown
grade in the BACOP/FND protocol.
BACOP/FND

Overall, 144 patients were registered for the
BACOP/FND trial. However, for the current analysis, 18
patients were excluded because they had either Ann Arbor
stage II disease without B symptoms or bulky disease, and
1 patient was excluded because of a misdiagnosis. Therefore, 125 patients were considered for the current analysis.
Treatment was discontinued early in 6 patients for the following reasons: 2 patients died from bronchopneumonia
(1 after the first BACOP treatment and 1 after the first
FND treatment), 1 patient died from myocardial infarction that was not treatment related in the opinion of the
treating physicians after the first BACOP treatment, 2
patients refused to continue treatment after the first
BACOP treatment, and 1 patient refused to begin therapy
immediately after the informed consent had been
obtained. Overall, 119 of 125 patients (93%) completed
chemotherapy in 28 to 32 weeks.
The responses in the intent-to-treat analysis by
phase of treatment are reported in Table 2. After IF-RT,
the overall response rate for all 125 patients was 90%, and
78 patients (62%) attained a CR. A univariate analysis of

Toxicity

The comparison between our 2 phase 2, sequential trials is
limited by the retrospective nature of the study, and the
results have to be evaluated carefully. There was a significant difference between the observed CR rate for BACOP/
FND and BACOP/FR (P ¼ .014). A significant difference
also was maintained after adjusting for age. No differences
were noted in the FFS rate. The OS at 4 years was significantly different (P ¼ .002) when it was evaluated with the
Kaplan-Meier estimate and the log-rank test. In addition,
by using Cox analysis before and after and adjusting for age
and FLIPI score, we observed an increased HR for
BACOP/FND (P ¼ .009). Hematologic side effects and
infections were more frequent in the BACOP/FND trial
compared with the BACOP/FR trial, and 2 patients died as
a consequence of pulmonary infection in the BACOP/
FND cohort. However, we did not observe any significant
differences regarding toxicity between the 2 trials.

differences in the FLIPI score or in other prognostic variables in the 2 studies. The only parameter with a significant difference was age, but a Cox analysis that was
adjusted for age and FLIPI score revealed an increased
HR for BACOP/FND. Although conclusions between
nonrandomized groups may depend on differences in
observed and unobserved prognostic features, we are confident that the statistical analysis of our results suggests
that the addition of rituximab has a favorable effect on
the prognosis of advanced follicular lymphoma. The
results obtained in the BACOP/FR trial were better in
terms of response and OS compared with the results
from the BACOP/FND trial.
It is interesting to note that approximately 26% of
patients attained a molecularly negative CR (12%) or PR
(14%) after only 3 BACOP treatments but before the
addition of rituximab. These results agree with others.19
The initial chemotherapy most likely is able to select
patients who have disease that is particularly sensitive to
chemotherapy or patients with low numbers of bcl-2-positive cells in the bone marrow.20 Furthermore, by using a
Cox regression analysis that was adjusted for FLIPI score,
patients who received rituximab had better FFS compared
with all other patients enrolled in both trials who received
chemotherapy only, as indicated by a decreased HR (0.57;
95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.96; P ¼ .035). In conclusion, our data indicate that the response rates and survival outcomes improved significantly with the addition
of rituximab to anthracycline-fludarabine–containing
chemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma, whereas overall toxicity does not increase
but remains transient and tolerable.

DISCUSSION

Conflict of Interest Disclosures

Toxicity was evaluable in 193 patients. The most commonly noted toxicities were infections, which were
observed in 3.6% of patients, and hematologic side
effects, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, which were reported in 3.1%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of
patients, respectively. Overall, the hematologic toxicities
were transient and reversible. However, a treatment delay
was necessary in patients who suffered grade 3 and 4 neutropenia. In these patients, we observed a median treatment delay of approximately 30 days in both trials. No
significant differences were observed in the percentage of
grade 3 and 4 side effects for the 2 groups of patients.
Comparison Between the Results
of the 2 Trials

The results of retrospective and controlled studies suggest
that the addition of rituximab to several different chemotherapies induces an improvement in the survival outcome of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma. In
the current study, we report the results from 2 subsequent phase 2 studies using similar chemotherapy
schemes with or without the addition of rituximab. To
assess whether the improvements in CR and survival
observed in patients who received BACOP/FR were a
direct result of the addition of rituximab, as opposed to a
