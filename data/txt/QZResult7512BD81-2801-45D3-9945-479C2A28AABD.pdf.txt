Abstract
Accurate markers and molecular mechanisms of stem cell dormancy and
activation are poorly understood. In this study, the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil,
was used to selectively kill proliferating cells of human bronchial epithelial (HBE)
cell line. This method can enrich and purify stem cell population. The dormant versus
active status of stem cells was determined by phosphorylation of RNAp II Ser2. The
surviving stem cells were cultured to form stem cell spheres expressing stem cell
markers and transplanted into nude mice to form a teratoma. The results demonstrated
the properties of stem cells and potential for multi-directional differentiation.
Bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction showed that demethylation of the
Sox2 promoter by 5-FU resulted in Sox2 expression in the dormant stem cells. This
study shows that the dormancy and activation of HBE stem cells is closely related to
epigenetic modification.

INTRODUCTION

We induced tracheal epithelium cells into tracheal
epithelium stem cells using 5-FU in serum-free culture,
which formed teratomas after transplantation into nude
mice. The results of this study demonstrated a new method
of inducing stem cells without gene transduction. This
study also explored the relationship between the activation
and dormancy of tracheal stem-like cells and epigenetic
molecular mechanisms.

Adult stem cells in the body are generally in a
state of dormancy or the G0 phase of the cell cycle.
Stem cells can be activated to re-enter the cell cycle via
stimulation by specific environmental or internal factors
[1–3]. However, the underlying mechanism is relatively
unclear. At present, studies on stem cell activation and
dormancy are mainly focused on hematopoietic [4–7],
melanocyte [2], epidermal [8, 9], and cancer stem cells
[10–12]. Several theories have been proposed to explain
the dormancy and activation mechanism of stem cells,
including phosphorylation of RNA polymerase [13, 14],
p27 gene regulation [15, 16], regulation of TGF-β/
Smad pathway [17], cell dormancy based on autophagy,
biochronometer theory, and insulin/Igf1 pathway. It is
known that 5-FU concentrates stem cells and increases
the proportion of cells in the G0 phase [18, 19, 20, 21].

RESULTS
Treatment with 5-FU inhibits proliferation of
HBE cells
We used MTT method to analyze HBE cell
proliferation. The proliferation rate of serum-free cultured
cell spheres was significantly higher than untreated
HBE cell. The proliferation rate of 5- FU treated HBE cells

was the slowest. Based on the results, median inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of 5-FU (40 μg/mL) for 24 h was
chosen as the dose used for subsequent experiments [20].
Cell cycle distribution was assayed with 5-FU
treated cells and serum-free cultured cells. G0 phase
population increased which contains stem cells. Both
methods can enrich stem cells.
After treatment with 5-FU, the HBE cell population
in S phase decreased from 22.82 ± 2.02% to 13.18 ±
3.23%, whereas the cell population in G1/G0 phase
increased from 71.57 ± 3.52% to 82.26 ± 5.72%. Thus,
5-FU treatment caused cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0
phase, with only slight effects on cells in other phases
of the cell cycle. Since most stem cells are in G0 phase,
we hypothesized that 5-FU treatment might result in the
enrichment of stem cells. Whereas serum-free cultured
HBE cell sphere population in S phase decreased from
22.82 ± 2.02% to 17.44 ± 5.68%, whereas the cell
population in G1/G0 phase increased from 71.57 ±
3.52% to 80.58 ± 4.74%. All the comparisons above are
significant (Figure 1B).

group showed 90.0% methylation level of Oct4, 73.2%
methylation of Nanog. Compared with control group,
the methylation of Oct4 and Nanog changed weakly.
The methylation of the Sox2 promoter remarkably
decreased from 8.2% to 4.8%, leading to its activation
(Figure 2).
Serum-free cultured group showed 88.1%
methylation level of Oct4, 70.8% methylation of Nanog.
Compared with HBE group, the methylation of Oct4 and
Nanog changed weakly. The methylation of the Sox2
promoter decreased from 8.2% to 4.8%, leading to its
activation (Figure 2).
Both 5-FU-treated group and serum-free cultured
group showed 4.8% methylation level of Sox2, whereas
control HBE cells showed 8.2% methylation level of
Sox2. Both methods activated stem cells.

5-FU treated and serum-free cultured HBE
cells promote formation of teratomas after
transplantation
To assess the tumor forming potential, 3 × 105
HBE cells and 3 × 105 serum-free cultured 5-FU-treated
HBE cells were injected into mice and tumor formation
was monitored. Five weeks after injection, all three mice
injected with serum-free cultured 5-FU-treated HBE
cells had tumors with an average volume of 600 mm3
(Figure 3A), whereas no tumor growth was observed after
inoculation with untreated HBE cells.
Pathology results confirmed that the tumors
formed by serum-free cultured 5-FU-treated HBE cells
were teratomas. Teratoma showed differentiation into
cell types from three germ layers. HE staining showed
the tissues containing squamous epithelia (ectoderm),
glandular epithelia (endoderm) and smooth muscle
(mesoderm) (Figure 3B). The immunohistochemical
staining showing expression of the lineage markers
α-Fetoprotein (endoderm) (Figure 3Ca), Smooth muscle
actin (mesoderm) (Figure 3Cb) and βIII tubulin (ectoderm)
(Figure 3Cc) from three independent derivations. Teratoma
formation demonstrated the pluripotency.

Both 5-FU treated cells and serum-free cultured
cells exhibit high clonogenic capacities
Only 7.0 ± 1.06% of HBE cells were able to
form clones. 5-FU-treated HBE cells was 24.5 ± 4.63%
(Figure 1C). Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in clone formation efficiency between 5-FU
treated and untreated cell populations (p < 0.01). The
clone-forming capacity of serum-free cultured HBE cell
spheres was 28.0 ± 3.78%, serum-free cultured HBE cell
spheres were able to form 4 times clones than untreated
HBE cells (p < 0.01; Figure 1C).

HBE cells that survive 5-FU treatment exhibit a
high capacity for sphere formation
The vast majority of HBE cells died after 24 hrs
treated with 5-FU (Figure 1Db); however, a small
proportion of the HBE cells survived and generated floating
spherical colonies after 10 days in culture (Figure 1Dd).
Survived HBE cells after 5-FU treatment exhibited a
higher capacity for sphere formation (Figure 1Dd). The
spheres of 5-FU-treated cells grew faster and larger
(Figure 1Dd) than those untreated HBE cells (Figure 1Dc).

5-FU enhances the expression of stem cell
markers in HBE cells
There was little Oct4, Nanog, or Sox2 expression
in the parental HBE cells. However, after treatment with
5-FU at the IC50 of 40 μg/mL for 24 h, the expression of
Oct4 (Figure 4Ab), Nanog (Figure 4Ac), and especially
Sox2 (Figure 4Aa), increased, and ABCG2 also became
positive (Figure 4B). The Western blot data showed trends
for Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog that were similar to those
observed by immunofluorescence (Figure 4C).

Both 5-FU treatment and serum-free culture
induced demethylation of Sox2, and activated
stem cells
Control cells (untreated) showed 89.7%
methylation of Oct4, 74.0% methylation of Nanog, and
8.2% methylation of Sox2. In contrast, 5-FU-treated

Differences of dormant tracheal stem cells,
activated tracheal stem cells and terminally
differentiated tracheal cells

At this time, cells stayed in the resting states of stem
cells. Oct4 was negative and RNA polymerase II CTD
phospho-Ser5 was positive in untreated differentiated
HBE cells. Oct4 was positive in 5-FU treated HBE cells,
and CTD polyIISer5 was positive, too (Figure 5Ab).
RNA polymerase II CTD phospho-Ser5 was not related
to the states of stem cells. In untreated HBE cells,
β-catenin was present at the cell membrane. In contrast,
after 5-FU treatment, cells exhibited substantially higher
levels of total and nuclearβ-catenin compared with
untreated HBE cells (Figure 5B). Thus, high levels of
nuclear accumulation of β-catenin are consistent with
activation of stem cells.

To clarify the differences between 5-FU-treated
and untreated HBE cells, we co-stained cells with
antibodies against Oct4 and  RNA polymerase II CTD
phospho-Ser2 or  RNA polymerase II CTD PhosphoSer5 and performed fluorescence microscopy. Oct4 was
negative in untreated differentiated HBE cells, and RNA
polymerase II CTD phospho-Ser2 was positive. Oct4 was
positive in 5-FU-treated HBE cells, and RNA polymerase
II CTD phospho-Ser2 was negative (Figure 5Aa).

DISCUSSION

domain phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Most
differentiated and senescent cells actively synthesize
mRNA. In these cells, RNA polymerase II of Ser2 and
Ser5 is phosphorylated irrespectively of the cell cycle.
Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II is absent
in dormant cells (G0 phase) such as T lymphocytes.
However, RNA polymerase II phosphorylation status
of tracheal dormant stem cells is unknown. We treated
tracheal cells with 5-FU and cultured them in serum-free
medium, thus enriching stem cells in G0 phase. Stem
cells can be isolated from a mixed culture containing
differentiated cells. Studies have shown that cells
with negative expression of RNA polymerase II Ser2
phosphorylation and positive expression of perinuclear
Oct4 or Sox2 are dormant stem cells. RNA polymerase

Characterization and identification of dormant
tracheal stem cells
Dormant tracheal stem cells are generally in
G0 phase, but not all G0 cells are stem cells; some are
differentiated. The difference between stem cells and
differentiated cells in G0 phase is that the former may
re-enter the cell cycle, while the latter will exit the cell
cycle and perish. A decline of mRNA synthesis causes
cells to enter the dormant period and thus regulates cell
cycle and metabolism. The initiation and maintenance of
mRNA transcription and subsequent RNA polymerase II
release by DNA are closely related to carboxy-terminal

II Ser5 phosphorylation is not related to the states of stem
cells. Since the activation of stem cells is associated with
Wnt pathways, the location of β-catenin expression can
be used to indicate the status of the cells, where nuclear
expression would indicate activation and cytoplasmic
expression would indicate differentiation [22, 23, 24].
Some scholars have suggested that dormant stem
cells are spherical, whereas differentiated cells have
multiple apophyses. We believe that cell shape is an
inadequate indicator of dormant or active status.

disappeared. The process involving demethylation of DNA
promoter and activation of Sox2 gene is very similar to
that observed in embryonic stem cell activation and
dormancy [36–44]. DNA methylation correlates closely to
gene silencing. Unmethylated DNA regions are associated
with gene activation.

5-FU treatment in serum-free medium induced
HBE cells to form tracheal stem cells, whose
successful purification was confirmed by
teratoma formation after transplantation into
nude mice

5-FU causes Sox2 DNA promoter demethylation
and reactivation of tracheal stem cells

HBE cells treated with 5-FU in serum-free culture
assumed a spherical shape instead of an adherent
culture. Thereafter, these cells formed a teratoma when
transplanted into nude mice. The tumor was positive for
ectodermal marker, β III-tubulin; mesodermal marker
Smooth muscle; and endodermal marker α-Fetoprotein.
HBE cells can develop into pseudostratified ciliated
columnar cells in serum and 3-dimensional culture, and
purified stem cells can be obtained after treatment. Further,

In this study, HBE cells were treated with 5-FU,
resulting in a decrease in numbers of cells in the S phase
and thus, cells in G0/G1 phase were concentrated. This
phenomenon has been previously observed in several
tumor cells from the gastrointestinal tract [25, 26], lung
[27–34], and liver [35]. Treatment of HBE cells with
5-FU resulted in decrease in methylation of Sox2 DNA
promoter from 8.4% to 4.8%, and the methylation island

CONCLUSIONs

Western blotting

(1) Cells negative for RNA polymerase II and
positive for perinuclear Oct4 or Sox2 are dormant stem
cells. That can be used to identify dormant stem cells.
(2) 5-FU can cause Sox2 DNA promoter
demethylation, which in turn reactivates tracheal stem
cells from dormancy to the active state.
(3) Teratomas formed after transplantation of serumfree cultured 5-FU-treated HBE cells, which confirmed
successful purification of tracheal stem cells. Thus, the
results of this study demonstrated a new method to induce
stem cells without altering cellular genetics.

HBE cells were incubated on ice for 20 min
in 50 μL of RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 mM
PMSF, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate,
2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM Na3VO4.
Following centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 20 min at
4°C, the supernatant was transferred to a new EP tube for
determination of the concentration of the protein content.
Next, 60μg protein from each sample was resolved on 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes.
Membranes were then blocked in TBST solution
containing 4% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing, the membrane was incubated overnight
at 4°C with specific primary antibodies at appropriate
concentration in 1% BSA solution. After washing the
membrane three times for 15 min with TBST solution, the
membrane was further incubated with appropriate HRPconjugated secondary antibodies in TBST solution for 2 h
at room temperature. The membrane was washed three
times for 15 min by TBST solution and incubated with ECL
solution for 1 min. Protein bands were visualized using the
ECL chemiluminescence method. Relative protein levels
were quantified using GAPDH as loading control.

METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
The human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE
was obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
HBE cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100
units/mL penicillin (Sigma), and 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Sigma). Cells were grown on sterilized culture dishes
and were passaged every 2 days with 0.25% trypsin
(Invitrogen).

Cell immunofluorescence

MTT assay

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 20 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4) for 20 min, washed three times, and
permeabilized with 1.0% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells
were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Sox2
antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-Oct4 antibody, rabbit RNA
Polymerase II CTD Repeat Antibody (Phospho-Ser2)
antibody, rabbit RNA Polymerase II CTD Repeat Antibody
(Phospho-Ser5) antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin
antibody, and mouse polyclonal anti-Nanog antibody for
1 h at room temperature before being washed three times
and incubated with goat anti-rabbit conjugated secondary
antibody and goat anti-mouse conjugated secondary
antibody for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining. The stained
cells were mounted and viewed under a BX51 inverted
epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

HBE variability was assessed using the MTT
assay. Approximately 5 × 103 cells/well were seeded into
96-well culture plates and incubated under normal culture
conditions for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The cells were then
incubated with 20 μL MTT (10 mg/mL) for 4 h at 37°C,
and 200 μL DMSO was added to solubilize the formazan
product for 20 min at room temperature. The optical
density (OD) was determined using a spectrophotometer
(Bio-800, Bio-Rad, USA) at a wavelength of 570 nm.

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle was assayed by measuring DNA
fragment staining with propidium iodide (PI). In brief,
HBE cells, 5-FU treated cells and sphere cells were
harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4°C
overnight. Ethanol-fixed cells were centrifuged and
washed once with PBS. The cell pellet was then suspended
in 0.1 mL RNaseA (5 mg/mL) and incubated in a 37°C
shaker for 30 min. Then, the cells were stained with a
propidium iodide (50 µg/mL) and incubated in the dark for
30 min at 37°C. In total, 10, 000 cells were harvested. The

Nude mice tumor specimens were fixed with 10%
neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm-thick
sections were prepared. Immunostaining was performed
using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method
(Ultrasensitive™, MaiXin, Fuzhou, China). Paraffin
sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in graded
alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating
the sections for 1.5 min in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer, pH
6.0. Non-specific staining was reduced by incubation
in blocking buffer containing goat serum (SP KIT-B1;
Maixin-Bio, Fuzhou, China) for 30 min. Then, the sections
were incubated with α-Fetoprotein, Smooth muscle, βIII
tubulin antibody overnight at 4°C. The following day,
the sections were incubated with appropriate secondary
antibodies for 30 min. The reaction was visualized
using DAB (DAB-0031; Maixin-Bio) plus chromogen.
Specimens were examined using a BX50 microscope
(Olympus). For serum controls, 1% BSA in PBS was used
