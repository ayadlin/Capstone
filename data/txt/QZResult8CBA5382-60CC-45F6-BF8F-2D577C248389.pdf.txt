Novel Chemotherapy Approaches for
Cervical Cancer
Sujana Movva, MD1; Lorna Rodriguez, MD2; Hugo Arias-Pulido, PhD1; and Claire Verschraegen, MD1

Cancer of the cervix is the second most common malignancy among women worldwide. The last 20 years have
lead to numerous advances in the medical management of locally advanced cervical cancer, including preventive vaccination, chemoradiation, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The treatment of metastatic disease is palliative at best. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for inoperable patients who have
recurrent disease. However, because most patients initially receive concomitant platinum-based therapy with
radiation, many recurrent tumors are refractory to platinum. The use of novel therapeutic approaches targeted
to the carcinogenic processes that leads to the ontogenesis of cervical cancer should be promoted in clinical

General Treatment Rules

Worldwide, carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the second most common malignancy among women
and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.1 Cancer of the uterine cervix ranks third among female
genital system malignancies in the United States, and approximately 11,070 new cases and 3870 deaths
have been estimated for the year 2008.2 In the United States, despite an increase in the incidence of carcinoma in situ, invasive cervical cancer rates have decreased steadily over the last decades because of early
detection and treatment of preinvasive disease.
Women with cervical cancer usually present with early stage disease. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry indicate that only 8% of women with cervical cancer were diagnosed with metastatic disease at the time of presentation between 1988 and 2003.3 For stage 0 to IB1 cancers
and for some stage IIA cancers, the treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or both, depending on
patient and physician preference (Table 1). Bulky stage I (stage IB2) and locally advanced (stages II-IVA) cervical cancers are treated with concurrent chemoradiation in the United States. Palliation with platinumbased chemotherapy remains the standard of care for inoperable patients who have advanced disease.4
Selected patients with isolated central recurrence can be treated with curative intent by pelvic exenteration.
For this report, we reviewed published and developing chemotherapy approaches in the multidisciplinary and medical management of cervical cancer with a focus on biologic modalities of therapy (Fig. 1).

Multidisciplinary Treatment
Concurrent chemoradiation: The
American approach

For bulky (stage IB2) or locally advanced (stage IIIVA) cervical cancer, the primary treatment consists of
concurrent chemoradiation with platinum-based chemotherapy, because radiation alone fails to control the disease

in 35% to 90% of patients.5 Data from 5 phase 3 randomized trials, which, together, involved 1912 patients with
cervical cancer, demonstrated that platinum-based chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation therapy prolongs survival in women who have locally advanced
cervical cancer.6-10 On the basis of these data, in February
1999, the National Institutes of Health issued a treatment

consensus with the recommendation of giving strong
consideration to the incorporation of concurrent chemotherapy with radiation therapy for women who require
radiation therapy for cervical cancer (available at: http://
www.nih.gov/news/pr/feb99/nci-22.htm accessed May 1,
2009). Recently, a Cochrane Library meta-analysis of
4921 patients in 24 randomized trials revealed improved
overall survival (OS) (platinum group only) and progression-free survival (PFS) when concomitant chemoradiation was used for women with locally advanced disease.11
In current practice, the most common regimen is cisplatin
at a dose of 40 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks during radiation
treatment. To our knowledge, there is no consensus
regarding adjuvant surgery or chemotherapy after the
completion of chemoradiation.
Noncisplatin-based regimens

A few randomized trials are using agents other than
cisplatin as part of a combined modality treatment in
patients with locally advanced disease. All drugs studied in
combination with radiation confer a significant survival
advantage compared with radiation alone. These drugs
include epirubicin,12 mitomycin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU),13 and capecitabine.14
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
radiotherapy

The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)
before radiation was studied extensively in the 1980s.
The rationale for such treatment included reducing tumor mass and radiosensitizing tumors by decreasing the
hypoxic cell fraction in large tumors. However, several
randomized trials of NACT before radiation have not
demonstrated a survival benefit compared with radiation
therapy alone.15-23 However, it is noteworthy that a
meta-analysis of 2074 patients by the Neoadjuvant
Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Metaanalysis Collaboration group24 reviewed 18 trials and
observed that there was a survival advantage for NACT in
studies that used higher doses of cisplatin (25 mg/m2
per week) or chemotherapy cycles 14 days. In trials that
used lower doses of cisplatin and longer chemotherapy
cycles, there was an actual decrease in survival rates. That
analysis suggested that the development of resistant tumor clones may be dependent on the schedule of chemotherapy and that there may be a benefit of short-duration,
3168

high-intensity (also called dose-dense) chemotherapy
treatments.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery: The
Italian, Asian, and South American approach

In many parts of the world, NACT before surgery
is an accepted treatment for locally advanced stages of
cervical cancer. An advantage of chemotherapy in this
setting is the potential significant reduction in tumor
burden, which facilitates surgical excision in previously
inoperable tumors. If surgical margins are negative, then
this approach also may obviate the need for radiation
therapy and is the standard of care in regions where
radiotherapy facilities are limited. Trials of NACT
followed by surgery in locally advanced disease have
demonstrated effectiveness without increase in surgical
complication rates.25-37 Response to NACT is an important prognostic factor for survival.37 In a separate analysis by the Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally
Advanced Cervical Meta-analysis Collaboration group24
of NACT followed by surgery compared with radical
radiotherapy alone in patients with stage IB or higher
disease, data from 5 trials and 872 patients were
reviewed. There was a significant reduction in the risk of
death with NACT with a 14% improvement in absolute
survival at 5 years. In earlier operable stages, there was
no advantage of NACT before definitive surgical
treatment.31
The optimal NACT regimen is yet to be defined. A
randomized phase 3 trial of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin versus cisplatin and ifosfamide as neoadjuvant to
surgery indicated that the pathologic response rate was
significantly higher in the 3-drug group (48% vs 23%),
but OS did not differ.28

Chemotherapy for Advanced Disease
Women with distant metastatic and recurrent disease
traditionally have been treated with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Unfortunately, recent randomized trials
of recurrent disease indicate that there is a negative
impact from the use of cisplatin during primary treatment. In patients with recurrent disease who receive
previous cisplatin-based chemoradiation, response rates
to cisplatin reinduction are lower than the rates in

with recurrent disease who have previous platinum
exposure.

Other active agents include paclitaxel, irinotecan, topotecan, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and ifosfamide (Table 2).
Single-agent therapy may palliate patients who have a
poor performance status or other significant
comorbidities.

Single-agent chemotherapy

Single-agent cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 every 3
weeks became the standard of care in the 1980s and had a
response rate of 38%.39 Bonomi et al40 evaluated higher
doses of cisplatin and observed that, although objective
response rates were higher, they did not translate into survival differences. In addition, the higher dose group had
increased rates of myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity.
Studies have evaluated other platinum agents, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin.41-43 A phase 2 study of carboplatin at a dose of 400 mg/m2 every 4 weeks in patients who
had received prior radiation revealed a response rate of
28%. Side effects related to cisplatin, such as neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, were minimal or nonexistent.

Combination chemotherapy

Many single-arm trials have evaluated combinations
of a platinum analog with ifosfamide, paclitaxel, irinotecan, pegylated doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and have produced improvements in response rates compared with
single-agent treatment but no improvements in OS
(Tables 3, 4). A randomized comparison of cisplatin versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel by Moore et al44 demonstrated
a doubling of the response rate and PFS but no difference
in OS. A quality-of-life assessment of these same data

revealed no significant differences in overall scores
between treatment arms or between successive chemotherapy cycles. Consequently, the consensus regimen became
using the cisplatin-paclitaxel combination because of
improved response rate and PFS.45 In another randomized phase 3 trial by Long et al46 of cisplatin plus topotecan (3-day regimen) versus cisplatin alone, the OS was
longer (9.4 months vs 6.5 months), the median PFS was
longer (4.6 months vs 2.9 months), and the response rate
was better (27% vs 13%) for the combination group. For
the first time, combination therapy offered a survival benefit, and myelosuppression was the major adverse effect.
Additional side effects included nausea and vomiting,
mucositis, rash, and hepatotoxicity. This led to the approval of topotecan by the US Food and Drug Administration on June 14, 2006 for use in combination with
cisplatin to treat women with stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent carcinoma of the cervix not amenable to curative
treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy.47 Comparing the studies of Long et al and Moore et al, it is possible that the increased number of patients who received
previous cisplatin (57% in the topotecan study and 27%
in the paclitaxel study) changed the outcome of the singleagent cisplatin arm, yielding inferior response rates.
Indeed, Table 3 indicates that most cisplatin-doublet
studies produced an OS of approximately 9 months. Subsequently, a large Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
phase 3 study was designed to compare various doublets
of cisplatin (GOG-204) in the advanced cervical cancer
population. That study was stopped at a planned interim
analysis after a preliminary analysis of the 3 experimental
arms—cisplatin with topotecan (relative risk [RR],
23.4%), gemcitabine (RR, 22.3%), and vinorelbine (RR,
25.9%)—did not reveal a significant benefit compared
with the control arm (cisplatin and paclitaxel: RR,
29.1%).4 The FACT-Cx, the FACT/GOG 4-item neurotoxicity scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory 0 to 10 pain
intensity item were used to compare quality of life in the 4
arms. At the interim analysis, there were no statistically
different outcomes in quality-of-life scores.48 It is noteworthy that eligibility criteria for these GOG randomized
studies were restricted to better populations over time.
Hence, the survival rates are not comparable between
these studies. To address the use of carboplatin, Moore
et al49 published a small retrospective comparison of cisplatin and carboplatin, both with paclitaxel. In that com3172

parison, there was no difference in outcome, but the
carboplatin combination was less toxic and easier to
administer.
Chemotherapy Targeting Hypoxia
Tirapazamine

Tirapazamine (SR4233, WIN59075) is a benzotriazine di-N-oxide. In preclinical testing, cytotoxicity is
directed selectively toward hypoxic cells, which tend to be
resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is known
that cervical cancers are hypoxic tumors because of early
necrotic development. In the face of hypoxia, tirapazamine is metabolized to free radicals, which induce DNA
breaks. Tirapazamine enhances radiation-induced cell kill
in hypoxic cells through a dose-dependent and scheduledependent manner. Preclinical testing also has revealed
that the simultaneous administration of cisplatin and tirapazamine induces an additive cytotoxicity. The clinical
development of tirapazamine in cervical cancer led to an
ongoing phase 3 trial (GOG-219), which will determine
whether the addition of tirapazamine to cisplatin during
radiation therapy has acceptable toxicity and improves
PFS and OS for primary treatment of locally advanced
cervical cancer.
Sanazol

Sanazol (AK-2123) is a nitrotriazole that also has the
potential to sensitize hypoxic tissue to radiation. A multicenter randomized study of 333 patients that examined
radiation alone versus radiation with sanazol in women
with advanced cervical cancer (stages III and IV) demonstrated an improvement in both the objective response
rate and the crude survival rate. Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy
was the main drug-related side effect but usually was
reversible.50

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors

EGFR, a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor that
regulates multiple functions such as cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, and development, is a 170-kDa
cell surface glycoprotein that is present in many tissues
and cell types (Fig. 2). EGFR is overexpressed in a wide
variety of solid tumors, including cervical cancer.51-60 In

FIGURE 2. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways and their inhibitors are shown. The activation of
EGFR by EGF leads to homodimerization (EGFR-EGFR) and/or heterodimerization (EGFR-HER-2 shown here), phosphorylation
of specific tyrosine residues, and recruitment of several docking proteins (gray-yellow) at the intracellular portion of the receptors. These adaptor proteins pass downstream of the signal using either the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway
(orange) or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (dark-green), whereas the phospholipase Cc (PLCc)
(blue) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) transcription factors (gray-pink) bind directly to the receptor.
PI3K also can bind directly any of the erbB partners (HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4) of EGFR heterodimers. The activated receptors
undergo endocytosis (green dotted circle) and follow 3 possible routes: recycling (Rec.) back to the membrane, lysosomal degradation (LD), or nuclear translocation (NT). Once in the nucleus, EGFR can behave either as a true transcription factor or as coregulator of other gene transactivators. Both pathways result in nuclear activation of genes associated with cell proliferation,
evasion of apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. In cervical cancers, the human papilloma virus type 33 (HPV E5) proteins inhibit
the lysosomal degradation of EGFR, leading to increased EGFR recycling and, hence, augmented EGFR levels. A few of the available inhibitors are illustrated. Monoclonal antibodies (Y-shaped orange and purple molecules) act extracellularly, avoiding EGFR
ligand binding, whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) compete with the ATP binding to the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain (pink)
of the EGFR receptor. COi indicates cyclooxygenase inhibitor; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; Gab-1, growth factor

members of the erbB receptor family, and interaction with
other cell signaling systems and viral proteins (Fig. 2).63
In particular, human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins
seem to play an important role in EGFR expression. HPV
is considered the primary etiologic factor in the development of nearly all cervical cancers.64 The HPV E5 oncoprotein inhibits degradation of internalized EGFR,65,66
resulting in an increase in EGFR recycling and over
expression of EGFR. Furthermore, expression of highrisk HPV E6 has been linked to an increase in EGFR levels,67,68 and changes in functional levels of the HPV E6/
E7 proteins may alter the growth rate of cervical cancer
cell lines by reducing the stability of EGFR at the
post-transcriptional level.69
EGFR inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of various cancers. Currently, there are 2 different
ways of pharmacologically targeting EGFR: anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, was ineffective in patients with refractory cervical
cancer, although 87% of tumors expressed high levels of
EGFR.70 A phase 2 study of combined erlotinib, cisplatin,
and radiation therapy71 in 23 patients with untreated
stage IIB to IIIB squamous cell carcinoma induced a complete remission rate of 91.3%, which was higher than the
rates produced in trials of cisplatin and radiation alone.
Additional studies of EGFR kinase domain inhibition
with lapatinib, an EGFR and HER2 dual inhibitor, with
or without pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor against the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), has accrued,
but the results are pending.
No EGFR point mutations of exons 18 through 21
were detected in 89 cervical cancer samples and cell
lines.72 This lack of mutation may prevent the activity of
small-molecule tyrosine inhibitors, such as gefitinib and
erlotinib, in contrast to monoclonal antibodies, such as
cetuximab and panitumumab, which block extracellular
ligand binding to EGFR. In fact, preclinical studies of
cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric monoclonal antibody
against EGFR, produced significant inhibition (range,
37%-58%) in all EGFR-positive cervical cancer cell lines
tested.73 A study that combined cetuximab with the combination of cisplatin and topotecan was terminated prematurely because of excessive hematologic, renal, and
infectious toxicity.74 Previous treatment and poor performance status of the patients may have contributed to
3174

those toxicities, but a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction cannot be excluded. A current phase 2
study that is being conducted by the GOG will determine
the efficacy of single-agent cetuximab in patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. Recent analyses in
patients with lung and colon cancers have suggested that
mutations of the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) are associated with lower response
rates and, in certain situations, a detrimental effect to
treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies.75 RAS genes are members of the guanidine triphosphatase (GTPase) gene superfamily. RAS mutations
result in the inhibition of GTPase activity and cause tumor cells to divide independent of EGFR signaling. Kang
et al76 evaluated 258 tissue samples of primary cervical
cancer and demonstrated that 13.9% of adenocarcinomas
had KRAS mutations; whereas, in squamous cell carcinoma samples, the mutation was observed in only 1.4%.
The role of KRAS mutations in the treatment of cervical
cancer is an area that needs further investigation.
Angiogenesis inhibitors

Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor
growth and progression in a variety of cancers and is visible clearly in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia before the
invasive state. Several studies have demonstrated
decreased survival in patients with cervical cancer who
have increased tumor vascularization and lymphovascular
invasion. VEGF is 1 of the most important factors
involved in regulating angiogenesis.51,77,78 Gaffney et al51
examined tumor specimens from 55 patients with stage
IB through IVA cervical cancer and observed that
increased VEGF levels were associated with decreased disease-free survival and OS. Studies by Loncaster et al79 and
Cheng et al80 also have linked VEGF over expression with
a poor prognosis.
Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antivascular EGF antibody, currently is being used in the treatment of colon,
lung, breast, and renal cell cancers. In a retrospective study
by Wright et al,81 6 women with metastatic disease who
received previous 5-fluorouracil and then bevacizumab
had a 67% clinical benefit rate with a median time to disease progression of 4.3 months. Currently, the GOG is
conducting a phase 2 trial of bevacizumab in patients with
persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. A phase 3 study comparing the platinum standard

with a nonplatinum regimen will test bevacizumab further
with a 2  2 factorial design (GOG-240).
Therapeutic vaccination and immunotherapy

HPV has been implicated in the development of
essentially all cases of invasive cervical cancer.82 The
recently approved Gardasil vaccine (Merck & Company,
Inc., Rahway, NJ) has a near 100% protective effect
against HPV type 6 (HPV-6), HPV-11, HPV-16, and
HPV-18–related diseases when given to sexually naive
girls and young women, but it does not have any therapeutic effects against already established infections.83
In a study by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group of 29 women with metastatic or recurrent cervical
cancer, interleukin-12 (IL-12) was given for 5 days every
21 days. IL-12, an immunopotentiator of T-cell function,
may facilitate a lymphoproliferative response to peptides
from HPV. Blood was obtained at periodic intervals to
assess immune response to the HPV type 16 E4, E6, and
E7 peptides. Although there was an improvement in
immune response with therapy, there was no difference in
objective response or survival.84 Single-agent activity of
interferon is low (<10% response rate); however, a biochemotherapy trial of interferon in combination with
paclitaxel and retinoic acid is producing promising
results.
Epigenetics

Epigenetics refer to changes in genes because of
modifications in DNA. Two of the most studied epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation. The objective of therapeutic agents that target such mechanisms is to reactivate the expression of
silenced tumor suppressor genes. HPV is the primary
causative agent for the development of cervical cancer;
therefore, it is necessary to consider epigenetic processes
in the host and in the virus that could lead to carcinogenesis. In a small phase 2 trial of cisplatin and decitabine (a
DNA-hypomethylating agent), 8 of 21 women who had
advanced cervical cancer achieved a partial response, and
5 women had stable disease.85 A recent phase 1 study of
magnesium valproate in 12 women with newly diagnosed
cervical cancer indicated that doses of valproic acid
between 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg were effective at inhibiting histone deacetylase activity.86 It is noteworthy that
hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibiCancer

tors are known as radiosensitizers; therefore, studies of
chemoradiation with the addition of these agents currently are underway.
In conclusion, as a neoadjuvant approach, chemotherapy has had an impact on the survival of patients with
advanced but localized cervical cancer and may allow surgical therapy in patients who initially would not be considered resectable. However, the NACT algorithm has
not been adopted readily in the United States because of
successful chemoradiation strategies in locally advanced
disease. Studies of new radiation sensitizers are being conducted with agents that target selectively hypoxic cells and
epigenetic phenomena. When cervical cancer persists or
recurs after definitive treatment, currently available, single-agent and combination chemotherapy regimens are
palliative at best. Pelvic exenterative surgery may allow for
a secondary cure in very selected patients who have central
recurrences only. No improvement in survival has been
achieved over the last 25 years in the metastatic or recurrent patient population, underlying the need to test new
therapeutic approaches. Because of the link between HPV
and cervical cancer, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the biology of carcinogenesis of the uterine
cervix and the interaction with the host immune response.
When biologic targets are overexpressed, they can be
inhibited by designed monoclonal antibodies or smallmolecule inhibitors. Many biologic targets currently are
under study, such as EGFR and VEGFR.
