ABSTRACT
Chloramphenicol is an old antibiotic that also inhibits mammalian mitochondrial
protein synthesis. Our studies demonstrated that chloramphenicol is highly cytotoxic
to myeloma cells, acting in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Chloramphenicol
sharply suppressed ATP levels in myeloma cells at concentrations ≥ 25 μg/mL.
Colorimetric and clonogenic assays indicate that chloramphenicol inhibits growth
of myeloma cell lines at concentrations ≥ 50 μg/mL, and inhibits primary myeloma
cell growth at concentrations ≥ 25 μg/mL. Flow cytometry and Western blotting
showed that chloramphenicol induces myeloma cell apoptosis at concentrations
≥ 50 μg/mL. Chloramphenicol increased levels of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9
and cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that myeloma cell apoptosis occurs through the
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. It thus appears chloramphenicol is not
only an old antibiotic, it is also a potential cytotoxic agent effective against myeloma
cells. This suggests chloramphenicol may be an effective “new” drug for the treatment
of myeloma.

Introduction

complete catabolism via the TCA cycle and OXPHOS
in mitochondria) [7]. Perhaps targeting tumor cell
metabolism to suppress ATP production could be an
effective future therapy for MM [8].
Prior reports showed that chloramphenicol
inhibits mammalian mitochondrial protein synthesis
and causes mitochondrial stress, leading to decreased
ATP biosynthesis [9–14]. The use of chloramphenicol
as an antimicrobial agent to treat bacterial infections
has decreased over the years because it suppresses bone
marrow function in humans secondary to inhibition of
mitochondrial protein synthesis [15, 16]. However, it has
been suggested that this adverse effect could be used to
benefit leukemia patients [16–18].
Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
chloramphenicol treatment causes mitochondrial stress,
but prevents cancer cell apoptosis, and enhances cancer
invasion, particularly in some solid tumors containing
anoxic environments that rely on anaerobic glycolysis to

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell tumor
characterized by clonal expansion of malignant plasma
cells within the bone marrow [1, 2]. Although the recent
use of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory
drugs has improved response rates and overall survival,
this tumor remains incurable for the vast majority of
patients, so new treatments are urgently needed [3, 4].
Cellular metabolism is the most important
characteristic of living cells. Both normal and tumor
cells must produce enough energy to maintain life and
support cell proliferation by diverting enough metabolic
intermediates to biosynthetic pathways [5–7]. Cellular
energy is mainly stored in the form of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), which is produce through anaerobic
and aerobic glycolysis–two ATPs are generated per
molecule of glucose via glycolysis in the cytoplasm
and up to 36 ATPs per glucose are produced through

generate ATP [10–12]. On the other hand, bone marrow
is regarded as an oxygen-rich microenvironment, in
which myeloma cells produce large amounts of energy to
support cell proliferation and contribute to the synthesis
and excretion of monoclonal immunoglobulin. In our
pre-assays, data showed that chloramphenicol inhibited
the proliferation of myeloma cells, but the underlying
mechanism is not yet fully understood. We hypothesized
that chloramphenicol may decrease cellular energy
metabolism, thereby inhibiting MM cell proliferation and
colony formation.

had almost no impact on the invasiveness of MM cells
(Figure 3C).

Tumor cell apoptosis
We next determined whether chloramphenicol
induces apoptosis of MM cells. As indicated in
Figure 4A–4B, chloramphenicol dose-dependently
increased the rates of both early (annexin V positive and
PI negative cells) and late (annexin V and PI positive
cells) apoptosis, with a significant effect observed at
concentrations ≥ 50 μg/mL. Cleaved caspases 3 and
9 are the activated forms of these proteolytic enzymes,
which are biomarkers of apoptosis. Western blot
analysis suggested that chloramphenicol (≥ 50 μg/mL)
increased the abundance of Cytc, cleaved caspase 9, and
cleaved caspase 3 in tumor cells, and that this effect on
the caspases was blocked by 25 μM Z-VAD-FMK, a
nonspecific caspase inhibitor (Figure 4C). As a possible
control for chloramphenicol, rotenone induced increases
in the abundance of Cytc, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved
caspase 3 in tumor cells. As a control for MM cells,
PBMCs showed no increases in Cytc, cleaved caspase
9 or cleaved caspase 3 after 48 h of treatment with
chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL) (Figure 4D)

Results
Cell growth inhibition
To determine the effect of chloramphenicol on cell
growth, RPMI8266 and U266 cells, as well as unstimulated
freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), taken as a normal cell counterpart, were
exposed to chloramphenicol or its vehicle, and the number
of viable cells was measured using colorimetric assays.
Dose- and time-response curves were obtained over a
range of doses and days. The colorimetric assays indicated
that chloramphenicol inhibited MM cell proliferation in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1A–1B), but
only weakly inhibited the proliferation of normal PBMCs
(Figure 1C). We suggest that the proliferation and energy
metabolism of MM cells are probably at a higher level than
in normal PBMCs. Chloramphenicol was highly cytotoxic
at ≥ 50 μg/mL. The half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values were 142.45  μg/mL and 315.22 μg/mL
for RPMI8266 and U266, respectively. Importantly,
clonogenic assays showed that chloramphenicol dosedependently suppressed tumor cell colony formation
at concentrations ≥ 50 μg/mL (Figure 2A–2B). These
assays indicate that chloramphenicol suppresses MM cell
growth. Alcohol had no impact on cell proliferation at low
concentrations (< 5 μL/mL).

Proliferation and clonogenic assays with primary
tumor cells
To gain insight into the effect of chloramphenicol
on primary MM cells, bone marrow samples from patients
with MM were examined. Colorimetric and clonogenic
assays showed that chloramphenicol dose-dependently
decreased both the proliferation and clonogenicity of bone
marrow MM cells. The curves and figures indicate that
chloramphenicol at concentrations ≥ 25 μg/mL markedly
inhibited the growth of primary MM cells (Figure 5A–5C).
Flow cytometry showed that there was almost no
apoptosis among primary MM cells cultured alone for
48 h (Figure 5D).

Cellular ATP levels and in vitro tumor cell
invasion

Discussion

To test whether chloramphenicol impacts
mitochondrial energy metabolism in MM cells, tumor
cells were cultured with different concentrations of
chloramphenicol prior to measuring cellular ATP content.
The measurements confirmed that ATP levels in the tumor
cells decreased in the presence of chloramphenicol, and
the effect was dose-dependent (Figure 3A). A similar
effect was elicited by rotenone, an inhibitor of the
mitochondrial complex I electron transport chain, which
served as a positive control. As compared with MM cells,
ATP levels in normal PBMCs were only weakly decreased
by chloramphenicol (Figure 3B). In addition, transwell
in vitro invasion assays indicated that chloramphenicol

Chloramphenicol reversibly binds to the 50S subunit
of the 70S ribosome in prokaryotes, thereby inhibiting
peptidyl transferase and in turn protein synthesis [13],
[19]. As the structure of mammalian mitochondria is
similar to prokaryotes [13, 14, 20], mitochondrial protein
synthesis can also be inhibited by chloramphenicol. Our
results indicate that chloramphenicol sharply suppresses
ATP levels in human MM cell lines and primary MM
cells at concentrations ≥ 25 μg/mL and significantly
inhibits tumor growth at concentrations ≥ 50 μg/mL.
Flow cytometry and Western blotting showed that
chloramphenicol also induced MM cell apoptosis at
≥ 50 μg/mL. These data are consistent with earlier clinical

reports indicating that chloramphenicol caused bone
marrow suppression and aplastic anemia in a dose- and
time-dependent manner [9, 21–25]. It has been suggested
that the bone marrow toxicity of chloramphenicol may be
useful for treatment of leukemia [16–18]. Consistent with
that idea, our experiments indicate that chloramphenicol
may be beneficial for patients with MM.

We found that low doses of chloramphenicol (e.g.,
25 μg/mL) had almost no effect on the number or size of
tumor cell colonies during the 2–3 weeks of treatment in
MM cell clonogenic assays, but cellular ATP levels were
effectively suppressed at that concentration. This inhibition of
energy metabolism would change tumor biology, making it
unconducive to tumor cell growth [8]. In contrast to previous

reports [10, 11], a small increase in the chloramphenicol
dose (to ≥ 50 μg/mL) greatly suppressed tumor growth while
further decreasing ATP levels. These phenomena suggest that
a deep deficiency in ATP can effectively suppress tumor cell
proliferation. Perhaps one of the mechanisms is the lack of
one or more key energy metabolism intermediates resulting
from the inhibition of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial
protein synthesis. However, our studies focused on the
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway in which
cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and activates
caspase 9 downstream [26–29]. Western blot analysis
showed that higher doses of chloramphenicol (≥ 100 μg/mL)
induced production of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase 9, and
cleaved caspase 3, as did prolonged treatment with 50 μg/mL
chloramphenicol. These data suggest that chloramphenicol
not only reduces ATP levels in MM cells, it also induces
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In short, both decreased
ATP levels and MM cell apoptosis likely account for the
inhibition of tumor growth induced by chloramphenicol.
However, our findings do not exclude other apoptosis
pathways induced by chloramphenicol.

Chloramphenicol is highly lipid soluble [11, 30]. Its
target serum concentration for treating infectious diseases
is 10–30 μg/mL in serum, which corresponds to a dose
of 50–100 mg/kg/day [19]. Our experiments confirmed
that lower concentrations of chloramphenicol (25 μg/mL)
significantly inhibit primary MM cell proliferation, which
is consistent with a previous report of inhibition of mouse
myeloma cell proliferation by chloramphenicol [31].
Because chloramphenicol is highly fat soluble [11], it
likely reaches higher concentrations in the bone marrow,
where MM cells mainly survive and accumulate, than in
the serum [32]. Thus, higher local drug concentrations
may inhibit the growth of MM cells. Clinically, MM
patients are highly susceptible to serious infections due to
immunodeficiency [33, 34]. Chloramphenicol may be used
to control infections in these patients as well as to suppress
their tumors. This anticancer mechanism differs from that
of drugs currently used to treat MM and is worthy of
further study in the future. Indeed, our findings indicate
chloramphenicol may be an effective “new” cytotoxic
agent for treatment of myeloma.

suppressed tumor cells proliferation. The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM (error bars) for three separate experiments; *P < 0.05.

cells were then estimated using a hemocytometer.

Healthy donor samples, patient samples, and
human myeloma cell lines

Cellular ATP content measurement
Total cellular ATP levels were determined using an
ATP kit assay. MM cell lysates were prepared according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioVision, Mountain
View, CA). Each reaction was performed by mixing
5–10 μL of lysate with 90 μL of reaction buffer in a 96-well
plate. Finally, luciferase and its substrates were added,
and luminescence intensity was immediately measured
using a luminometer (TopCount; Packard, Ramsey, MN)
calibrated using appropriate ATP standards.

After the study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at Longgang District People’s
Hospital of Shenzhen, we collected peripheral blood of
healthy donors and bone marrow aspirates from nine
patients with MM. Healthy and patient volunteers all
provided informed consent obtained in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The U266 human myeloma
cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Yang Xu (Suzhou
University, Jiangsu, China). The RPMI8226 cell line
was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA).

Analysis of apoptotic cell death
To assess apoptotic cell death, cells were initially
washed twice in washing buffer (8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl,
1.44 g Na2HPO4, 0.24 g KH2PO4, and 1 L of H2O; pH 7.2)
and resuspended in 400 μL of Dulbecco’s PBS. Thereafter,
100 μL aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated with
10 μL of 50 μg/mL propidium iodide and 5 μL of annexinV-FITC for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The
cells were then analyzed using flow cytometry.

Reagent
Chloramphenicol was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO) and dissolved in alcohol. The chloramphenicol
solutions used in this study were freshly prepared and
protected from light. The final concentration of alcohol in
the test tubes was less than 0.5% (v/v).

Proliferation and clonogenic assays of MM cells

Western blotting

To establish the dose- and time-dependent responses
to chloramphenicol, MM cells (1 × 104/well) were plated
in round-bottom 96-well plates and incubated in 200 μL
of medium containing the indicated concentration of
chloramphenicol (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg/mL
for the dose-response assays; 48 h at 100 μg/mL for
the time-response assays). Proliferation of treated and
untreated MM cells was assessed using colorimetric
assays (Cell Counting Kit-8; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan).
Briefly, 20 μL of CCK-8 were added to each well and
incubated for 3–4 h at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator.
The absorbances at 450 nm and 630 nm were monitored
using a microplate reader (ELX800, BIO-TEK, USA).
To determine the capacity of chloramphenicol
to inhibit clonogenic tumor cell growth, U266 and
RPMI8226 MM cells were plated in quadruplicate in
35 mm2 tissue culture dishes (tumor cells: 10,000/well)
and incubated in the presence of different chloramphenicol
concentrations in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
0.9% methylcellulose, 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2 mM of l-glutamine, and 20 μg/mL of gentamycin sulfate.
The cells were incubated for 2–3 weeks at 37°C under a
5% CO2 atmosphere, after which colonies consisting of
> 40 cells were counted under a microscope.

For western blotting, MM cells were lysed in
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer, and
aliquots of the resultant lysate were loaded onto 10% SDS
polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins in
the gel were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets;
probed for 2 h with primary antibodies against cytochrome
C (Cytc), cleaved caspase 9, and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danyers, MA, USA); diluted
1/1000 in PBS-T with 5% milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) at room temperature; washed three times
with PBS-T; incubated with a secondary antibody (HRPconjugated anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h at room temperature;
washed three times with PBS-T; dried and incubated for
1 min with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); and visualized in a Kodak Imager
(KodakFilm, Kodak, USA). The caspase inhibitor z-VADFMK was purchased from ICN (USA).

In vitro invasion assays
In vitro invasion assays were carried out in transwell
plates using membranes with 8 μm pores, as previously
described [10]. Briefly, each transwell membrane was
pre-coated with 25–30 μL of diluted Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Belford, MA) (1:3 dilution with a serumfree DMEM), after which RPMI8266 or U266 cells
(2.5 × 104 cells per well) were seeded on top of the
Matrigel layer and incubated for 48 h. Non-invading
cells and the Matrigel layer were then removed using a

side of the membrane, were fixed by immersion in 4%
formaldehyde for 3 min. Finally, the invading cells were
counterstained with 0.05% crystal violet and counted.

Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from bone
marrow samples using density gradient centrifugation.
The CD138+ and CD138− fractions were then isolated
from the MNCs using CD138 microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec) and an AutoMACS magnetic cell sorter (Miltenyi
Biotec). The CD138− fraction was further depleted of
normal hematopoietic progenitors using CD34, CD3,
CD4 and CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The
resulting two fractions (CD138+CD34−CD3−CD4−CD8−
and CD138− CD34−CD3−CD4−CD8− cells; 2.5 × 105/mL)
were plated with or without different concentrations of
chloramphenicol in round-bottom 96-well plates for
colorimetric assays or in a methylcellulose culture system
containing rhIL-6 (10 ng/mL, PeproTech) for clonogenic
assays (1 × 105 cells per well). Tumor cell colonies were
counted after 2–3 weeks of culture. As a control for
MM cells, CD34+ progenitor cells from one donor’s
peripheral blood were cultured in a methylcellulose culture
system with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (cells: 100,000/well). The
phenotype of the cells in these colonies was confirmed by
flow cytometry.
