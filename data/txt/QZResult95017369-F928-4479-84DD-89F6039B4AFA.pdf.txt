SUMMARY PARAGRAPH

Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs expressed in different tissue and cell types
that suppress the expression of target genes. As such, miRNAs are critical cogs in numerous
biological processes1,2, and dysregulated miRNA expression is correlated with many human
diseases. Certain miRNAs, called oncomiRs, play a causal role in the onset and maintenance of
cancer when overexpressed. Tumors that depend on these miRNAs are said to display oncomiR
addiction3–5. Some of the most effective anticancer therapies target oncogenes like EGFR and
HER2; similarly, inhibition of oncomiRs using antisense oligomers (i.e. antimiRs) is an evolving
therapeutic strategy6,7. However, the in vivo efficacy of current antimiR technologies is hindered
by physiological and cellular barriers to delivery into targeted cells8. Here we introduce a novel
antimiR delivery platform that targets the acidic tumor microenvironment, evades systemic
clearance by the liver, and facilitates cell entry via a non-endocytic pathway. We found that the
attachment of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) antimiRs to a peptide with a low pH-induced
transmembrane structure (pHLIP) produced a novel construct that could target the tumor

microenvironment, transport antimiRs across plasma membranes under acidic conditions such as
those found in solid tumors (pH ~6), and effectively inhibit the miR-155 oncomiR in a mouse
model of lymphoma. This study introduces a new paradigm in the use of antimiRs as anti-cancer
drugs, which can have broad impacts on the field of targeted drug delivery.

Author Manuscript

Silencing aberrantly expressed miRNAs in vivo has been achieved using antisense with
various nucleic acid analogs involving locked nucleic acids (LNA), 2′-O-methyl
oligonucleotides (e.g. antagomiRs), and PNAs or nanoencapsulated PNAs5,9,10. As with
most RNA-based therapies, each of these strategies is stymied by non-specific organ
biodistribution, reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance, and endolysosomal
trafficking8,11. Acidosis is a hallmark of tumors12. The pHLIP peptide forms an inducible
transmembrane alpha-helix under acidic conditions13, has the ability to translocate
membrane-impermeable molecules into cells via a non-endocytic route13,14, and when
administered systemically, can target a variety of epithelial tumors15. Exploiting acidity as a
general property of the tumor microenvironment we find that the pHLIP peptide can localize
to tumors of lymphoid origin in a subcutaneous flank model (Fig. 1a) and a model of
disseminated lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1b), while avoiding the liver. Although pHLIP also
shows kidney targeting, much of the peptide is cleared by renal excretion (Extended Data
Fig. 1). To exploit these targeting and delivery properties we developed a tumor-targeted
antimiR delivery vector (pHLIP-antimiR).

PNAs are nucleic acid analogs comprising nucleobases joined by intramolecular amide
bonds. This backbone imparts stability, nuclease resistance, and an increased binding
affinity for complementary nucleic acids16. We hypothesized that pHLIP would facilitate the
intracellular delivery of charge-neutral PNA antimiRs (Fig. 1c), which lack anionic
phosphodiester groups, to cells within the tumor microenvironment. Tethering PNA
antimiRs to pHLIP represents a unique approach because the multifunctional peptide
component both targets tumors and mediates lipid membrane translocation13.

Author Manuscript

Fabrication of pHLIP-antimiR was verified by RP-HPLC, tricine SDS-PAGE, EMSA, and
mass spectrometry (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). In our constructs, the linkage between the
PNA and peptide comprised a disulfide bond, which can be cleaved in the reducing
environment of the cytosol (Fig. 1c)17; therefore, attachment to the inserting C-terminus of
pHLIP promotes the intracellular delivery of the PNA antimiR. When administered to A549
cells (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2d) and Toledo diffuse large-B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f), which express elevated levels of miR-155
compared to other DLBCL cells18, a pHLIP-antimiR modified with a TAMRA label
attached resulted in enhanced cellular delivery at acidic extracellular pH compared to neutral
pH. PNA delivery to cells by pHLIP does not appear to be greatly affected by sequence
since uptake has been demonstrated with numerous miRNAs including miR-182 (Fig. 2a
and Extended Data Fig. 2d), miR-155 (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f), scrambled miR-155,
miR-21, and miR-210. Delivery of antimiR-155 by pHLIP (pHLIP-anti155) derepressed
luciferase in miR-155-overexpressing19 KB cells that stably expressed a miR-155-targeted
dual luciferase sensor (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Additionally, inhibition of miR-155 by
pHLIP-anti155 reduced KB cell viability at a dose comparable to LNA (15-mer, Exiqon)

antimiR-155 delivered by lipofection (Fig. 2b). To demonstrate the adaptability of this
antimiR delivery technology to silencing other miRNAs, pHLIP was attached to a PNA
antimiR against miR-21, which derepressed a miR-21 luciferase sensor (Extended Data Fig.
2h). Together, these data suggest that pHLIP-antimiR is effective at delivering PNA
antimiRs to multiple cancer cell types, in which endocytosis is hypothesized to be relegated
to a supplemental mode of cell uptake due to the transport properties of pHLIP.

Certain oncomiRs have emerged as pharmacological targets. For example, ectopic
expression of miR-155 in mice provided the first evidence that dysregulation of a single
miRNA could cause cancer20. Although aberrant expression of miR-155 is characteristic of
numerous cancers, miR-155 is notorious for its oncogenic involvement in lymphomas21. We
previously developed a Tet-Off-based mouse model in which miR-155 expression is induced
in hematological tissues and can be attenuated with the addition of doxycycline (DOX)5.
Between 2–3 months of age, these mir-155LSLtTA mice develop disseminated lymphoma, in
which lymphoid tissues progress from normal histology, to follicular hyperplasia, to
follicular lymphoma, to DLBCL (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Although these are aggressive
cancers comprising neoplastic B cells with a high Ki-67 proliferative index, the disease
dramatically regresses upon DOX-induced miR-155 withdrawal (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c).
Therefore, this is a model of oncomiR addiction in which tumorigenesis is dependent on
expression of miR-155 and its removal leads to cancer regression22.

Author Manuscript

We assessed the therapeutic efficacy of pHLIP-anti155 in vivo using two tumor models
based on mir-155LSLtTA mice: (1) nude mice subcutaneously implanted with neoplastic B
cells derived from the enlarged spleens of mir-155LSLtTA mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a) and
(2) mir-155LSLtTA mice after progression to conspicuous lymphadenopathy (Extended Data
Fig. 4b). Continuous suppression of miR-155 via DOX-impregnated mouse chow or a
cocktail of chemotherapeutics and anti-inflammatory steroids (CHOP) served as positive
controls that each cause tumor regression (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Since CHOP is part of
the current standard of care for human lymphomas23, the similar response to treatment with
DOX and CHOP demonstrated the potential utility of antimiR-155 cancer therapy.
Accordingly, intravenous administration of pHLIP-anti155 to the flank tumor model resulted
in a significant reduction in tumor growth (Fig. 3a). In a subsequent study at a higher dose,
pHLIP-anti155 showed a significant survival advantage compared to a commerciallyavailable LNA (Exiqon) antimiR optimized for in vivo miR-155 silencing (Fig. 3b and
Extended Data Fig. 5b). After administration of pHLIP-anti155, mice exhibited no clinical
signs of distress, toxicity and renal damage (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Note that the dose of
pHLIP-anti155 used in this study was much lower (ranging from 17- to 40-fold) than what
has been used in other antimiR delivery reports10,24.

In addition to delaying tumor growth, pHLIP-anti155 treatment suppressed the metastatic
spread of neoplastic lymphocytes to other organs. The liver, lymph nodes, and spleen were
common targets for metastatic lymphocytes. In a blinded pathological assessment, livers
from mice treated with pHLIP-anti155 and DOX had rare scattered aggregates of 1–3
neoplastic lymphocytes, while livers in the negative control groups typically had dense
tumoral aggregates of up to two dozen cells scattered throughout the entire organ (Fig. 3c)—
note that these tissues were harvested at an early endpoint (i.e. when the negative controls

reached a tumor size of 1 cm3, Fig. 3a) in relation to the survival study (Fig. 3b) in order to
resolve pharmacological effects. Early endpoint treatment with pHLIP-anti155, DOX, and
CHOP reduced the onset of splenomegaly (as judged by spleen mass), which occurred in all
of the negative control groups (Fig. 3d). Additionally, pHLIP-anti155 significantly delayed
the development of conspicuous lymphadenopathy (Fig. 3e), which was particularly evident
in the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes throughout all of the groups (Extended Data Fig.
5d).

Author Manuscript

Based on a blinded complete blood count (CBC) analysis, the negative control groups
comprised a large number of atypical mononuclear cells of lymphoid origin—consistent
with the leukemic phase of lymphoma. Treatment with pHLIP-anti155 and DOX had levels
of circulating lymphocytes similar to wild-type, while CHOP treatment resulted in
lymphocyte levels much lower than wild type (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Although pHLIP can
target to metastasized lymph node tumors (Extended Data Fig. 1c), the therapeutic effects on
the levels of circulating lymphocytes suggest that the lower incidence of metastatic spread is
likely due to antimiR activity at the primary tumor. These findings support the effective
targeting of systemic antimiR-155 therapy to neoplastic cells (Extended Data Fig. 5f). The
additional lymphopenia caused by CHOP treatment likely reflects the general toxicity of
non-targeted conventional chemotherapy drugs (Extended Data Fig. 5e). The absence of
systemic toxicity may represent an important advantage for pHLIP targeted antimiR therapy.
Importantly, when healthy C57BL/6 mice were treated at the highest dose and frequency
used in this study, pHLIP-anti155 showed no significant impairment of liver and kidney
function (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Additionally, WBC levels (Extended Data Fig. 6b), body
mass (Extended Data Fig. 6c), and organ mass (Extended Data Fig. 6d) were all within
normal ranges.

In addition to the miR-155-addicted lymphoma subcutaneous tumor model, pHLIP-anti155
was also effective at treating KB cell xenograft tumors, which stably expressed luciferase
for intravital monitoring of tumor bioluminescence (Extended Data Fig. 7), as well as
disseminated tumors in mir-155LSLtTA mice. Although implanted subcutaneous tumor
models are effective for evaluating tumor growth, spontaneous cancer models arising in
endogenous tissues are a more clinically relevant means of assessing therapeutic efficacy.
Remarkably, systemically administered pHLIP-anti155 accumulated in the enlarged lymph
nodes of the transgenic mir-155LSLtTA mice (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, like most therapeutics,
PNA oligomers are known to be cleared by the RES11, which results in accumulation in the
liver; pHLIP-anti155 showed ~10-fold reduction in liver accumulation compared to anti155
alone (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). The therapeutic impact of pHLIP-anti155 in
mir-155LSLtTA mice was supported by a statistically significant decrease in spleen size and a
non-statistically significant reduction in lymph node tumor burden (Fig. 4b and Extended
Data Fig. 8c–e). A non-statistically significant increase in apoptosis was also observed in the
lymph nodes of treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Interestingly, blinded
histopathological analysis revealed that spleens in pHLIP-anti155-treated mir-155LSLtTA
mice had differentiated red and white pulp (similar to wild type mice with no treatment),
while the splenic architecture of mir-155LSLtTA mice treated with pHLIP-antiscr was almost
completely effaced (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8h). As with the subcutaneous tumor

studies, pHLIP-anti155 treatment also showed a 12-fold reduction in liver metastasis (Fig.
4d and Extended Data Fig. 8i,j), while flow cytometric analysis revealed reductions in
populations of B220-expressing spleen cells (Extended Data Fig. 8k). Consistent with a lack
of systemic toxicity, treatment with pHLIP-anti155 produced no histopathological kidney
damage (Extended Data Fig. 8l). Lastly, all mice that developed lymphoma-induced paresis
showed improved motor skills after pHLIP-anti155 treatment (Supplementary Videos 1–4, n
= 3).

For a more direct assessment of miR-155 silencing in mir-155LSLtTA mice, we monitored the
levels of miR-155 targets in response to antimiR treatment. As an oncogene in lymphoma,
miR-155 suppresses genes involved in processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, immune
response regulation, as well as cell differentiation and development21. However, the
addiction mechanisms by which lymphoma regresses upon miR-155 withdrawal are
unknown. Typically, miR-155 targets have been identified by differential gene expression
analysis of an overexpression condition compared to wild-type25. To uncover the genes
required for miR-155 addiction, we performed RNA-seq analysis on miR-155-addicted
lymphoid tumors compared to regressing tumors (Extended Data Fig. 9a). This is the first
study to identify miRNA cancer targets that directly result from oncomiR withdrawal. Out
of 29,209 mouse genes, 2,101 showed significant upregulation or downregulation in
response to miR-155 attenuation (Extended Data Fig. 9b, Supplementary Table 1). KEGG
analysis of upregulated genes revealed that 41% have been associated with cancer pathways
(Extended Data Fig. 9c). Additionally, 25% have been implicated in cell adhesion and
migration pathways such as leukocyte transendothelial migration. We compared the
upregulated genes to known and putative miR-155 targets (Supplementary Table 2)
identified using the miRWalk target prediction algorithm26. At the intersection of these
screens, several genes are known to have tumor suppressor characteristics (Fig. 4e, Extended
Data Fig. 9d, Supplementary Table 3). One notable gene is Bach1, a transcription factor that
has been validated as a miR-155 target in renal cancer and cultured B cells25,27. Gene
expression analysis was used to validate Bach1 as a miR-155 target in Toledo cells treated
with pHLIP-anti155 (Extended Data Fig. 9e) and in mir-155LSLtTA mice undergoing DOXinduced miR-155 withdrawal (Extended Data Fig. 10). Furthermore, diseased mir-155LSLtTA
mice treated with pHLIP-anti155 showed an increase in Bach1 levels in cancerous axillary,
cervical, and inguinal lymph nodes (Fig. 4f). A known miR-155 target in lymphoma,
Mafb24, was also upregulated in response to pHLIP-anti155 treatment (Fig. 4f). Therefore,
pHLIP-anti155 can target to lymph node neoplasms and cause effective blockage of
miR-155 activity.

While oncomiRs are proving to be potent anticancer targets, in theory, using this approach,
every miRNA is a “druggable” target. Through targeted antagonism of miRNAs, pHLIPantimiR has vast therapeutic potential for cancer and many other pathological conditions
that produce localized acidic environments such as ischemia, myocardial infarcts, stroke,
tissue trauma, and sites of inflammation and infection. The main limitation of this
transmembrane delivery approach involves the need for the drug cargo to have limited
charge, such as PNA antimiRs. While other antimiR delivery and targeting strategies have
been described28,29, utilization of pHLIP to target the acidic tumor microenvironment is a

widely applicable technology that will present new therapeutic and mechanistic
opportunities for effective targeting of miRNA silencing.

Methods
PNA synthesis

Author Manuscript

Regular Boc-protected PNA monomers were purchased from ASM Research Chemicals. All
the given oligomers were synthesized on solid-support using standard Boc chemistry
procedures30. The oligomers were cleaved from the resin using mcresol:thioanisole:TFMSA:TFA (1:1:2:6) cocktail solution. The resulting mixtures were
precipitated with ether (3X), purified and characterized by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF,
respectively. All PNA stock solutions were prepared using nanopure water and the
concentrations were determined at 90°C on a Cary 3 Bio spectrophotometer using the
following extinction coefficients: 13,700 M−1 cm−1 (A), 6,600 M−1 cm−1 (C), 11,700 M−1
cm−1 (G), and 8,600 M−1 cm−1 (T). The 23-mer PNA oligomer complementary to miR-155
has an estimated Tm of 77.8°C. Single-isomer 5-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)
purchased from VWR was exclusively conjugated to the N-terminus of PNAs with a
hydrophilic bifunctional linker, Boc-miniPEG-3Tm (11-Amino-3,6,9-Trioxaundecanoic
Acid, DCHA, denoted in the sequences by -ooo-) purchased from Peptide International.
Cysteine was also conjugated to C-terminus of PNAs using a Boc-miniPEG-3 linker.
The following PNA antimiR sequences were used:
anti155: TAMRA-ooo-ACCCCTATCACAATTAGCATTAA-ooo-Cys
antiscr: TAMRA-ooo-ACCCAATCGTCAAATTCCATATA-ooo-Cys

Author Manuscript

anti21: TAMRA-ooo-TCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTA-ooo-Cys
anti182: TAMRA-ooo-CGGTGTGAGTTCTACCATTGCCAAA-ooo-Cys.
Full length PNA antimiRs were used throughout this study. While current technologies such
as “tiny” LNAs have seen efficacy with miRNA seed-targeted 8-mer antimiRs31, truncated
PNA antimiRs should be similarly effective due to their high binding affinity, which can be
further enhanced with chemical modifications32.
Synthesis and characterization of pHLIP-antimiR

Author Manuscript

For the generation of pHLIP-antimiR constructs, the following pHLIP sequence (New
England Peptide) was synthesized:
AAEQNPIYWARYADWLFTTPLLLLDLALLVDADEGT(CNPys)G; conjugation of the
C-terminus to thiolated-PNA was facilitated by incorporating a cysteine group derivatized
with 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulphenyl (NPys). To synthesize pHLIP-antimiR constructs, pHLIPCys(NPys) and antimiR PNA (peptide:PNA 1:1.3) were reacted overnight in the dark in a
mixture of DMSO/DMF/0.1mM KH2PO4 pH 4.5 (v/v 3:1:1) under argon. Note that this
protocol was adapted from a general method of conjugating peptides to PNAs. Aside from
pHLIP, attaching molecules, such as cell-penetrating peptides, to PNAs can increase cellular
uptake and in vivo delivery efficacy33,34. However, these conjugates typically require high
doses and distribute to tissues throughout the body, which can result in off-target

effects11,35. Similarly, pHLIP can be attached to other antimiR compositions (such as LNA),
which would likely improve tumor targeting; however, physicochemical properties of PNA
make them more amenable to pHLIP-mediated membrane translocation. A750-pHLIP was
fabricated as previously described15.
Purification and verification of pHLIP-antimiR

Author Manuscript

After conjugation, pHLIP-antimiR was purified by RP-HPLC (Shimadzu) using a C18
column and a mobile phase gradient of water and acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.
Purified pHLIP-antimiR was further characterized using MALDI-TOF. Concentrations of
pHLIP-antimiR were determined on a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at
260 nm corrected for peptide and TAMRA absorbance. Gelshift analysis was performed
using a 20% TBE gel and Bolt electrophoresis system (Life Technologies); prior to loading,
samples were incubated with an equamolar amount of miR-155, denatured at 95°C for 2
min, and allowed to anneal at 37°C for 30 min. SYBR Gold (Life Technologies) was used to
visualize miR-155; pHLIP and free PNA were not detected by the stain. Tricine SDS-PAGE
was performed using a 16% tricine gel (Life Technologies) and standard SDS-PAGE
procedures. Samples were visualized first using TAMRA fluorescence on a Maestro 2
Multispectral Imaging System (PerkinElmer), and then using Simply Blue Coomassie stain
(Life Technologies). For disulfide reduction studies, pHLIP-antimiR was reduced for 30 min
in 200 mM DTT for HPLC and EMSA, and 5 mM TCEP for tricine SDS-PAGE. For all in
vitro and in vivo studies, pHLIP-antimiR was heated at 65°C for 10 min to prevent
aggregation.
Animals

Author Manuscript

All mice were maintained at Yale University in accordance with Yale Animal Resource
Center (YARC) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.
The mir-155LSLtTA mice were generated as previously described5. For transplant studies, 5–6
week-old female CrTac:NCr-Foxn1 nude mice (Taconic) were used. For toxicology studies,
8–9 week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson) were used. For treatment of mir-155LSLtTA
mice, a sample size of at least four was appropriate based on post hoc power analysis using
quantitation of spleen size (Extended Data Fig. 8d) with a 95% confidence interval. For all
animal studies, group allocations were randomized and all pathological analyses were
blinded to treatment groups and expected experimental outcomes.
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

For all pH-controlled cell culture experiments, cells (previously tested for mycoplasma and
supplied from ATCC) were incubated with 10% FBS in RPMI buffered at pH 7.4 with
HEPES or pH 6.2 with MES, and treated with pHLIP-antimiR suspended in reaction buffer
which constituted no more than 1% of the final volume.
Histology and other techniques
Harvested tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and processed by Yale Pathology Tissue
Services for H&E and TUNEL staining. Retro-orbitally collected whole blood preserved in
EDTA or serum separated using lithium heparin was sent to Antech Diagnostics for

complete blood count (CBC) or clinical chemistry analysis, respectively. Image
quantification performed using ImageJ 1.47v (NIH) and Color Deconvolution plugin (A.C.
Ruifrok). Intravital and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed on either an IVIS
Spectrum System (Caliper) or Maestro 2 Multispectral Imaging System using near-infrared
or TAMRA filter sets. Live mice were anesthetized using isoflurane during image
acquisition. For whole organ studies, organs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin
before imaging.
Flank tumor establishment

Author Manuscript

To establish mir-155LSLtTA lymphoma subcutaneous flank tumors, first enlarged spleens
were extracted from 2–3 month-old mir-155LSLtTA mice with obvious lymphadenopathy
(which generally correlated with incidence of splenomegaly). Using a 100 μm pore size cell
strainer technique, spleen tissue was dispersed into a single cell suspension in 5% FBS in
PBS on ice. Red blood cells were lysed using ammonium chloride lysis buffer (Stem Cell
Technologies), and 5 × 106 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Tumors were
generally palpable within 10 days; tumor volume was calculated as (Length x Width2)/2.

Author Manuscript

For bioluminescent xenograft tumors, KB cells were stably transfected with firefly
luciferase and clonally selected via hygromycin B selection; 5 × 106 cells were
subcutaneously injected into nude mice to establish tumors. RediJect D-Luciferin Ultra
Bioluminescent Substrate (PerkinElmer) was administered via the manufacturer’s protocol
for intravital monitoring of tumor bioluminescence using IVIS Spectrum (Caliper). It was
pre-established that for all flank tumor studies, animals were excluded if their tumors had
not reached a volume of 50–100 cm3 by the time of treatment. Animals were randomized
into experimental arms by minimizing the differences in mean tumor size and standard
deviation.
Confocal imaging and flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

For fixed cell confocal preparation, after treatment for 1 hour at with 5 μM of pHLIPanti155 (Fig. 2a), cells were washed with 1% BSA in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. All washes were performed using PBS
at pH 7.4 to wash away surface-bound pHLIP. Actin and nuclei were stained with Texas
Red-X phalloidin (Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies), respectively.
Cells were mounted in Slow Fade Gold (Invitrogen). Alternatively, Toledo cells were
treated with 500 nM pHLIP-anti155 (Extended Data Fig. 2e), washed with 1% BSA in PBS,
and imaged live without fixation or permeabilization. For tumor and liver tissues, organs
were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin, and then incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in
PBS. Tumors were flash frozen in OCT before slicing into 10 μm-thick sections,
permeabilization, staining, and mounting in Vectashield (Vector Labs). Cell and tissue
confocal imaging was performed using TCS SP5 Spectral Confocal Microscope (Leica);
confocal projections were constructed using LAS AF software (Leica) with 0.9 μm-stack
height. For live cell flow cytometry, after 48 hours of treatment, cells were washed 5x with
1% BSA in PBS on ice and then analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo
software (Tree Star); for B220 studies, freshly harvested spleen cells (see Flank Tumor
Establishment section) were blocked with 10% FBS (20 min); stained with Alexa488-anti-

concentration); washed 3x with PBS on ice, and transferred to 1% BSA 0.1% NaN3 in PBS
on ice before analysis.
Luciferase reporter and cell viability

Author Manuscript

For dual luciferase reporter experiments, the miRNA sensor was generated by inserting the
target sequence for miR-155 into the 3′UTR of Renilla luciferase on a psiCHECK™-2 vector
(Promega). KB cells were stably transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies)
and co-transfection with a Linear Hygromycin Marker (Clontech) followed by clonal
selection. Utilization of stable clones was more reliable than transiently transfected cells for
antimiR studies. Cell lysates were measured for luciferase activity 48 hours after treatment
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Control LNA antimiR-155
(Exiqon) was delivered by lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Optimal sensor activity was seen at a
500 nM dose, though inhibition of miR-155 was also observed at lower doses. For analysis
of miR-21 inhibition A549 cells were similarly treated with pHLIP-anti21 and relevant
controls; however, the cells were instead transfected with a miR-21-specific LightSwitch
miRNA Target GoClone Luciferase Reporter (Active Motif). Cell viability was measured 96

qPCR

Author Manuscript

For qPCR analysis of tissue after treatment with two 2 mg/kg injections of pHLIP-anti155 or
pHLIP-antiscr spaced 48 hours apart; tissues were harvested 24 hours after the last injection
and divided into at least five representative 1 mg slices. Tissue slices were pooled into
Trizol (Life Technologies) and homogenized using a Precellys 24 Homogenizer. Per the
manufacturer’s protocol, chloroform was added to facilitate phase separation, and the RNAcontaining aqueous phase was collected. An equal volume of 200 proof ethanol was added,
and RNA was purified from this mixture using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and standard procedures
with on-column DNase I digestion; standard RNeasy purification was followed for RNA
extraction from cells. RT-PCR was performed with 1 μg total RNA and poly-A based iScript
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed with Quantitect Primer
Assays (Qiagen) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) using a Roche LightCycler 480
System; all samples were normalized to β-actin.
RNA-seq

Author Manuscript

For RNA-seq analysis, the overexpression and withdrawal groups both consisted of three
mice with subcutaneous tumors that were established from enlarged spleens of diseased
donor mir-155LSLtTA mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The overexpression and withdrawal
mice were paired such that each of the three pairs was from a separate donor littermate.
Tissue was harvested once tumors reached a volume of 1 cm3; for mice in the miR-155
withdrawal group, DOX was administered for 16 hours before tissue harvest. As described
in the transplant methods, tumor tissue was dispersed into a single cell suspension and red
blood cells were lysed. Total RNA was extracted from the remaining cells using the hybrid

Trizol and RNeasy protocol described in the qPCR methods. High quality total RNA
(Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RIN value greater than 7) was sent to Expression Analysis for
library preparation, Illumina TruSeq mRNA sequencing (50 bp paired end, 25 million reads
per sample), alignment to the mouse genome (greater than 80% aligned to the NCBI37/mm9
assembly), and counts of the number of gene-mapped fragments given the maximum
likelihood abundances. DESeq was used to first estimate size factors (i.e. normalize samples
by their respective sizes) and dispersions (i.e. variance between samples), and then identify
differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 1). Heatmaps were generated using
variance stabilizing transformations of the count data based on a parametric fit to the overall
mean-dispersions.
KEGG analysis

Author Manuscript

Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) was used to identify the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) pathways that were enriched in the genes that were both upregulated in response to
miR-155 withdrawal and had a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05. Enriched KEGG
pathways had a minimum count threshold of 2 and a modified Fisher Exact P-value for gene
enrichment less than 0.05.

a, Intravenous injection of A750-pHLIP distributes to the (white arrow) kidneys and (blue
arrow) tumor in a representative mir-155LSLtTA subcutaneous flank model (n=3); time points
indicate hours after a single injection of A750-pHLIP. Previous reports have observed
systemic distribution of pHLIP to kidneys in other mouse models15. Similarly, we speculate
that the increased uptake of pHLIP peptide in the kidneys is due to excretion and increased
acidity of renal tubule cells. Initially kidneys are highly enriched for pHLIP, which is
gradually excreted while pHLIP shows a more steady accumulation in the tumor. b,
Representative example showing A750-pHLIP distribution to the (white arrow) bladder and

mir-155LSLtTA mice with lymphadenopathy (n=3). c, In addition to distributing to the (white

Figure 1. Targeting miR-155-addicted lymphoma using pHLIP

Author Manuscript

a,b, Targeting distribution of pHLIP labeled with Alexa Fluor 750 (A750-pHLIP) 36 hours
after systemic administration to (a) nude mouse with miR-155 flank tumors (n=3) and (b)
mir-155LSLtTA mouse with lymphadenopathy (n=3), Alexa Fluor 750 conjugated to cysteine
was the control. c, Schematic of pHLIP-mediated PNA antimiR delivery. (1) At pH less than
7, the C-terminus of pHLIP inserts across lipid bilayers, which facilitates delivery of
attached antimiR-155. (2) The disulfide between pHLIP and antimiR-155 is reduced in the
cytosol. (3) Intracellular antimiR-155 is free to inhibit miR-155.

a, Tumor growth response to treatment; arrows represent 1 mg/kg PNA dose per intravenous
injection; all with n = 3, except for pHLIP-anti155 group with n=4. b, Survival in response
to antimiR treatment; cutoff criteria include tumor volume greater than 1 cm3 or clinically
mandated euthanasia. Symbols represent 2 (arrowhead) or 1 (arrow) mg/kg intravenous
injections; LNA is a fully phosphorothioated LNA antimiR against miR-155; n = 4 for all
