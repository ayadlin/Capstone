ABSTRACT
Tumor sequencing has revolutionized oncology, allowing for detailed interrogation
of the molecular underpinnings of cancer at an individual level. With this additional
insight, it is increasingly apparent that not only do tumors vary within a sample (tumor
heterogeneity), but also that each patient’s individual tumor is a constellation of unique
molecular aberrations that will require an equally unique personalized therapeutic
regimen. We report here the results of 439 patients who underwent Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified next generation sequencing (NGS) across
histologies. Among these patients, 98.4% had a unique molecular profile, and aside
from three primary brain tumor patients with a single genetic lesion (IDH1 R132H),
no two patients within a given histology were molecularly identical. Additionally,
two sets of patients had identical profiles consisting of two mutations in common
and no other anomalies. However, these profiles did not segregate by histology
(lung adenocarcinoma-appendiceal cancer (KRAS G12D and GNAS R201C), and lung
adenocarcinoma-liposarcoma (CDK4 and MDM2 amplification pairs)). These findings
suggest that most advanced tumors are molecular singletons within and between
histologies, and that tumors that differ in histology may still nonetheless exhibit
identical molecular portraits, albeit rarely.

mutation testing in patients with melanoma, HER2
immunohistochemical staining in patients with breast
cancer). However, with the advent of multiplex methods
such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), detection of
similar mutations in other tumor types led to the utilization
of targeted therapy outside of its initial histologic
classification. For example, BRAF inhibitors have shown
promising efficacy in BRAF-mutated lung and thyroid
cancers as well as in hairy cell leukemia, indicating that
oncogenic driver mutations do not necessarily segregate
by histology, and matched molecular therapy is effective
across many, but not all, histologies [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
Beyond identification of the affected gene,
the precise genetic aberration has important clinical
implications. For example, in EGFR-mutated non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), only individuals with activating
mutations in exons 19 and 21 (L858R) are sensitive to the

INTRODUCTION
The advent of molecular-guided precision medicine
is impacting cancer therapy with an array of impressive
responses in patients who undergo matched targeted therapy.
Multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards are beginning to
help navigate this complex mutational landscape [1, 2].
The utilization of novel targeted therapies such as imatinib
in chronic myelogenous leukemia and trastuzumab in
HER2+ breast cancer, have transformed the field [3, 4].
More recently, a myriad of other targeted agents, such as
erlotinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer and
vemurafenib or dabrafenib in BRAF-mutated melanoma
among others, have shown success [5, 6, 7].
Traditionally, molecular testing for a relatively
small panel of genes was conducted in a histologicallydefined subset of patients to determine therapy (e.g. BRAF

first-generation EGFR inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib, and
afatinib while those with exon 20 T790M mutations or inframe insertions and/or duplications (codons 767 to 774)
are resistant to these agents [13, 14, 15]. Patients treated
with imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
with c-KIT mutations in exon 11 have an 83.5% response
rate versus 47.8% in patients with exon 9 mutations [16],
and PIK3CA H1047R mutations may be more sensitive to
PI3K/Akt/mTor inhibitors than other PIK3CA mutations
[11]. Thus, understanding the underlying genetic defect in
cancers requires identification of the culprit gene, as well
as the particular alteration in that gene, in order to better
predict responses to targeted therapy [15].
Based on CLIA-certified NGS of 439 tumors
at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, we report
here that 432 (98.4%) patients had a unique molecular
profile. The seven individuals who were not molecular
singletons include three with primary brain tumors and
a solitary molecular lesion (IDH1 R132H mutation),
and two sets of tumor molecular twins that had two
alterations in common—however, these alterations
did not segregate by histology (lung adenocarcinomaappendiceal cancer (KRAS G12D and GNAS R201C), and
lung adenocarcinoma-liposarcoma (CDK4 and MDM2
amplification pairs)). These findings demonstrate that the
vast majority of cancer patients have molecularly unique
tumors, and that patients may be more similar to others
with a different histology than to patients with the same
histology. This finding that has important implications
for defining cancer nosology, clinical trial design and
regulatory approval of new agents.

Alterations per patient
Only 19 patients (4%) had no detectable genomic
alterations. This group consisted of five patients with
malignant hematologic conditions, three primary central
nervous system (CNS) tumors, four gastrointestinal
(GI) tumors, two cutaneous primary, two head and neck
tumors, one breast tumor, and two cancers of unknown
primary. Patients with gastrointestinal malignancies had
the highest number of mutations on average (N = 6.5)
(Figure 1). Missense mutations were the most common
aberrations detected (32.5% of aberrations) followed by
amplifications (28.7% of aberrations). The median number
of alterations per patient was three, ranging from zero
(19 patients, 4.3%) to 16 (1 patient with colorectal cancer,
0.2%) (Figure 2). The most common number of alterations
(mode) detected was three (86 patients, 19.6%). The most
common mutations detected were in TP53, present in 195
patients (44%), followed by KRAS, which were detected
in 71 patients (16%) (Figure 3). Molecular testing was
performed on primary tumor specimens in 58.1% of cases,
and on metastatic lesions in 36.2% of cases. No matched
pairs of concurrent primary and metastatic tumors were
tested in this analysis. Between primary and metastatic
lesions (unmatched), there was no difference in the
number of alterations (mean of 4.1 alterations for primary
site vs 4.4 for metastatic sites; p = 0.311). Additionally, the
prevalence of common mutations listed above did not vary
significantly between primary and metastatic site.

within these genes). These included the seven patients
mentioned above that each had at least one molecular twin
amongst them, as well as 42 tumors amongst which each
patient had at least one gene level twin. Examining the
42 patients mentioned above, 26 patients had at least one
gene-level twin amongst them with the same histology;
16 patients had at least one different-histology gene
level twin amongst them. Within histologies, the only
molecularly identical patients were the three patients with
primary CNS glial tumors with solitary IDH1 R132H
mutation (Table 2).

Of 439 patients who underwent CLIA-certified nextgeneration sequencing, 432 (98.4%) had a unique molecular
profile (Table 1). Aside from three primary central
nervous system (CNS) tumors (2 oligodendrogliomas and
1 glioblastoma) with a single genetic lesion (IDH1 R132H
mutation), no two patients within a given histology
or organ-based diagnosis were molecularly identical
(Table  2). Additionally, two sets of patients had tumors
that were molecular identical twins, but these portfolios
did not segregate by organ-based diagnosis: KRAS G12D
and GNAS R201C without any other alterations were both
found in one patient with each of lung adenocarcinoma and
appendiceal cancer; CDK4 and MDM2 amplifications were
found in one patient with lung adenocarcinoma and one
with liposarcoma.
Examining patients at the genomic level, there were
49 of the 439 individuals (11.2%) studied, who had the
same genes involved (albeit with differing alterations

The discovery and clinical benefit of targeting
oncogenic drivers such as ALK, BCR-ABL, BRAF, EGFR, and
HER2, among others, has revolutionized medical oncology

understanding of the molecular landscape of tumors with
an exponential decline in costs [18]. As multiplexing
technologies have improved to allow greater numbers of
genes to be interrogated with lower tissue requirements, an
increased genetic diversity has been unmasked—not only
between patients, but within each tumor [19]. The Pan-Cancer
analysis project from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
has analyzed molecular aberrations, initially amongst 12
histologies, and has determined 17 mutational signatures
across histologies in addition to 14 copy number signatures,
with TP53 aberrations common across both signatures [20].
In our dataset, mutations in TP53 were the most commonly
detected aberration (44% of patients) followed by KRAS
mutations (16%).
In our experience, 98.4% of patients had a unique
molecular profile by targeted NGS of tumor. This finding
has major implications for clinical trial design and the
regulatory framework for drug approval. As an increasing
number of rationally designed, targeted cancer therapeutics
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are developed, the number of patients in the potential
study population with that particular aberration decreases.
However, the potential for response in that smaller
biomarker-selected population increases proportionally,
resulting in an asymptotic predilection for personalized “n
of one” trials to maximize clinical efficacy. For example,
the pivotal trial for FDA approval of pemetrexed in nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was a
randomized study with 1,725 patients and demonstrated
an overall survival benefit of 1.7 months compared to
standard chemotherapy [21]. In contrast, the FDA approval
of ceritinib was based on a single-arm phase 1 trial with
163 patients who had progressed and were intolerant to
crizotinib [22]. The primary endpoint supporting approval
was an objective response rate of 44% (95% CI 36%-52%)
and duration of response of 7.1 months. Though these results
indicate substantial improvement, further lengthening
of response duration may require combinations of drugs
customized to individual molecular portfolios. With the
32606

observation that molecular portfolios within and between
cancers are mostly distinct, and that the small number of
patients with tumors that are molecular twins are just as
likely to have distinct—rather than similar, histologies—
it becomes clearer that new approaches are needed. These
may include efforts to understand convergent pathways, or,
alternatively, entirely novel paradigms where the strategy of
molecular matching is tested, while the actual drugs given
to each patient differ [23]. A broad genomic approach to
next-generation sequencing may be advantageous as the
rapid development of novel therapeutics and an improved
understanding of pathway signaling increase the number of
potential efficacious therapeutic options [24]. Moreover,
biomarkers for immune checkpoint blockade, one of the
most promising areas of oncology, will require whole exome
sequencing for neoantigen prediction and the development
of personalized immunotherapeutic biomarkers [25].
A limitation of our study is the lack of whole
exome sequencing or interrogation of the transcriptome
or proteome; however to date “omics” beyond targeted
NGS has usually not been performed as part of routine
clinical testing or as part of broad-based genomicallydriven cooperative group trials such as NCI-MATCH [26].
However, integrated “omics” platforms are likely to detect
additional alterations and may demonstrate increased
molecular diversity beyond what is reported here. Other
limitations include the relatively small numbers of patients
within some histologies.
Overall, our study shows that the rate of genomic
twins (patients who have tumors with an identical genelevel aberration) was only 11.2%. The rate of molecular
twins (tumors in which the genes affected and the precise
site and type of aberration within the gene was identical)
was even lower—1.6%. It is plausible that earlier in the
disease course, there might be fewer aberrations and more
homogeneity [27]. Furthermore, molecular abnormalities
mostly did not segregate by tumor histology, a finding
consistent with other studies [28, 29]. Therapies such as
trastuzumab work against HER2-overexpressing tumors
regardless of whether they originate in breast or gastric
tissue, and clinical trials (NCT02091141, NCT01833169,
NCT01831726, NCT01885195, NCT01981187 and
NCT02002689) are testing this approach in a histologyagnostic manner and whether “oncogenic fraternal twins”
can be treated effectively as such [4, 30, 31]. While
molecular heterogeneity within breast cancer patients
has been reported, our study broadens the histologic
heterogeneity of tumor molecular profiling to include
other solid tumors as well as primary CNS tumors and
malignant hematologic conditions [32,33]. Importantly,
with our increased knowledge of oncogenic pathways and
an expanding pipeline of targeted agents, the vast majority
of patients (~90%) now have at least one potentially
actionable aberration [34, 35]. As technology improves
and biomarkers become more defined, the promise of
precision cancer medicine with a personalized approach
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for each patient is becoming a necessity. The advent of
immunotherapy has led to the emergence of additional
predictive biomarkers, including mutational burden at
a histologic level and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry
or MSI-H at an individual level [36, 37, 38]. Patients
who receive molecularly matched therapy, regardless of
histology, have improved responses to therapy and longer
survival [2, 12, 39]. Ultimately, novel clinical trial designs
that deploy advanced genomics and other methodologies
to interrogate tumors, and the utilization of rationallydesigned customized therapeutic combinations early in
the treatment course to prosecute tumors will be required
in order to better serve patients with cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Four hundred and thirty-nine patients seen at
UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center with advanced
malignancies who underwent CLIA)-certified next
generation sequencing (182 or 236 genes analyzed via
FoundationOne, Cambridge MA) starting in December
2012 had their tests results and clinical data recorded. All
data was extracted by M.S. from the electronic medical
record. This study was performed and consents obtained
in accordance with UCSD Institutional Review Board
guidelines
Genomic alterations detected included base
substitutions, insertions, deletions, and copy number
alterations [17]. DNA was extracted from 40 μm of
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (minimum
20% tumor cells) using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus
LEV DNA Purification kit (Promega) and quantified
using a standardized PicoGreen fluorescence assay
(Invitrogen). Library construction was performed using
50–200ng of DNA sheared by sonication to approximately
100–400 bp before end-repair, dA addition and ligation
of indexed, Illumina sequencing adaptors. Enrichment
of target sequences (all coding exons of 182 or 236
cancer-related genes and selected introns from 28 genes
recurrently rearranged in cancer) was achieved by
solution-based hybrid capture with custom biotinylated
oligonucleotide baits. Enriched libraries were sequenced
to an average median depth of > 500X with 99% of bases
covered > 100X (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using
49 × 49 paired-end reads) and mapped to the reference
human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner and the publicly available SAMtools, Picard,
and Genome Analysis Toolkit. Point mutations were
identified by a Bayesian algorithm; short insertions and
deletions, determined by local assembly; gene copy
number alterations (amplifications), by comparison to
process matched normal controls; and gene fusions/
rearrangements, by clustering chimeric reads mapped
to targeted introns. Genes were considered amplified if
at eight-fold copy number except for ERBB2, which is
amplified at seven-fold copy number.
