BACKGROUND: The 5-year survival rate for patients with pancreatic cancer is <5%, and it is always resistant to the current chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, new, effective agents for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. The promising strategy of
cancer-targeting gene virotherapy (CTGVT) has demonstrated great anticancer potential. The objective of the current study was to
determine whether 1 CTGVT approach, oncolytic virus (OV)-harboring lipocalin-2, is capable of treating pancreatic cancer. METHODS:
Tissue microarrays were constructed to detect the expression of lipocalin-2 in 60 specimens of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The clinical significance of lipocalin-2 was investigated in an analysis of correlations between lipocalin-2 expression and matched clinical characteristics. A lipocalin-2–expressing OV, ZD55-lipocalin-2, was constructed by deleting the adenoviral protein E1B55kD. The antitumor
efficacy and mechanisms of the OV were investigated in pancreatic cancer cells with v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (KRAS) mutations in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Lipocalin-2 expression was correlated with a good prognosis in patients
with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ZD55-lipocalin-2 dramatically inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo by
inducing cytolysis and caspase-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher lipocalin-2 expression predicted a better prognosis in
patients with pancreatic cancer. The results indicated that ZD55-lipocalin-2, which specifically expressed higher levels of lipocalin-2 in
tumor cells, may serve as a potent anticancer drug for pancreatic cancer therapy, especially for patients who have pancreatic adenoC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with a very poor prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with pancreatic
cancer is <5%.1 Only 10% of patients are capable of to undergoing radical pancreatectomy2; however, the median survival
for these patients is only 13.9 months.3 Meanwhile, pancreatic cancer remains highly chemoradioresistant.2 Gemcitabine or
gemcitabine-based combined therapies are standard treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer, but the survival benefits
from these treatments are extremely limited.4 Therefore, effective agents are urgently needed to treat this devastating disease.
Oncolytic viral therapy is 1 of the new therapies that have been developed in recent years. It was designed specifically
to replicate in tumor cells, which makes it an ideal therapeutic agent. Many oncolytic viruses without foreign anticancer
genes have been introduced into clinical trials,5-9 and some have exhibited great potential and have progressed toward
phase 3 trials. On the basis of oncolytic viral therapies, we initiated the cancer-targeting gene virotherapy (CTGVT). In
CTGVT, an antitumor gene is inserted into a modified oncolytic virus with a cloning site, such as ZD55. The oncolytic
virus is able to replicate several hundred-fold within cancer cells. The inserted antitumor gene also is replicated several
hundred-fold through accompanying oncolytic virus replication, which makes the antitumor effect of CTGVT much
greater than that of either gene therapy or oncolytic viral therapy alone.10 When the infected cancer cells are lysed, numerous replication-competent progeny viruses are released, infecting the neighboring cancer cells. Because virus replication
is targeted to the tumor cells,10 it will leave the normal cells intact. In our laboratory, this therapeutic strategy revealed
potential antitumor activity in tumors like hepatoma,11,12 leukemia,13 and colorectal cancer,14,15 and sometimes even
achieved the complete eradication of xenograft tumors in nude mice.
Of all human cancers, pancreatic adenocarcinoma has the highest incidence of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations (>80% or approximately 90%).16,17 KRAS mutations in tumors always predict
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.18-21 It was reported previously that, in RAS-transformed cells, lipocalin-2

reversed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype and inhibited tumor invasiveness, metastasis, and
angiogenesis.22,23 Lipocalin-2–induced apoptosis also was
reported in hematopoietic and endometrial carcinoma
cells.24,25 However, it remains unclear whether lipocalin2 can inhibit or kill pancreatic cancer cells. Our clinical
research indicated that lipocalin-2 is associated with a
good prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. In
addition, other interesting recent results indicated
that26,27 chemopreventive treatments inhibited tumor
promotion and progression in a preclinical tumor model
that activated lipocalin-2 gene and protein expression. All
of these results may provide a clue about the use of lipocalin-2 as an antitumor agent against pancreatic cancer.
The therapeutic value of oncolytic viruses, per se, for
pancreatic cancer has been reported previously,28,29 but
only a few studies have involved the use of CTGVT for
pancreatic cancer. In the current study, the significance of
lipocalin-2 expression in pancreatic cancer was investigated,
and a lipocalin-2–expressing oncolytic virus, ZD55-lipocalin-2, was constructed to investigate whether it could
strongly exhibit the ability to kill pancreatic cancer cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients’ Data and Construction of Tissue
Microarrays

Clinicopathologic data from 60 patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma were collected from January 2001 to
June 2006. The cohort included 37 men and 23 women,
and the median age (standard deviation) was of 61.70 
12.41 years. Forty-six patients underwent conventional
pancreatoduodenectomy, 3 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy plus portal vein resection and reconstruction, 2 patients underwent total pancreatectomy, 8
patients underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, and 1 patient underwent pylorus-preserving
pancreaticoduodenectomy. According to the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) tumor-lymph
node-metastasis (TNM) classification for malignant
pancreatic tumors (sixth edition; UICC, 2002), there
were 34 patients with stage I to IIA disease and 26 patients
with stage IIA to IV disease.
The tissue microarrays were constructed by Shanghai Outdo Biotech Company Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Representative regions were selected from hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections and marked on
individual paraffin blocks. Two tissue cores were obtained
from each specimen. Each core was precisely arrayed into
a new paraffin block. These microarrays were serially sectioned (4 mm) and stained with H&E to verify tissue

sampling and completeness. Then, lipocalin-2 expression
was analyzed by EnVision immunohistochemistry (Dako
Cytomation, Carpinteria, Calif).
Lipocalin-2 immunoreactivity was evaluated independently by 2 pathologists who were blinded to patients’
outcomes. Lipocalin-2 expression was graded as follows:
negative was defined as positive cytoplasmic staining in
<5% of tumor cells, and positive was defined as positive
cytoplasmic staining in 5% of tumor cells.
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions

HEK293 cells were purchased from Microbix Biosystems
Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Pancreatic cancer cell
lines (BxPC-3 and PANC-1) and human lung fibroblast
cell lines (NHLF-1 and MRC5) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va). Cells
were cultured in Dulbecco modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mmol/L glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 lg/mL streptomycin.
Plasmids and Recombinant Adenovirus
Construction

The pZD55 plasmid was constructed in our laboratory30
with the E1B55-kDa encoding gene deleted to restrict the
viral replication only to tumor cells. The lipocalin-2 gene
was amplified from a combinational DNA library (Clontech Corporation, Mountain View, Calif) by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Then, the lipocalin-2 gene was
cloned into pCA13 plasmid to construct pCA13-lipocalin2. Next, pCA13-lipocalin-2 was digested with the Bgl II
restriction enzyme to obtain an expression cassette that
included the cytomegalovirus promoter and lipocalin-2
coding sequences (CDS). This cassette was subcloned into
pZD55 plasmid to produce a pZD55-lipocalin-2 shuttle
plasmid. All plasmids were confirmed by restrictive enzyme
digestion, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Homologous
recombination using shuttle plasmids and pBHGE3
(Microbix Biosystems Inc.) was carried out in 293 cells to
generate ZD55-lipocalin-2 and Ad-lipocalin-2 (the typical
nonreplicative adenovirus). Recombinant viruses were
purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation.
Virus titers were measured by using a standard plaque assay
on HEK293 cells. ZD55-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and ZD55 were retained in our laboratory.
Reporter Gene Assay

PANC-1 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at approximately 80% confluence and then infected with ZD55EGFP. After 48 hours and 72 hours of exposure, the same
visual fields were examined to investigate whether the
ZD55-mediated gene would express the corresponding
protein in pancreatic cancer cells.

Viral Production Assay

PANC-1 and NHLF-1 cells were plated onto 6-well plates
at 80% confluence and then infected with ZD55-lipocalin-2. After 48 hours, medium and cells were collected,
and the virus was released by freeze-thawing for 3 cycles
and centrifuged to collect the supernatant. Virus titers
were determined by using a standard plaque assay in 293
cells.
Cell-Viability Assay and Cytopathic Effects

Cells were grown in 96-well plates and then treated with
various viruses for different times. Cell viability was quantified by using a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthizol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. To detect
the tumor-specific cytopathic effects of ZD55-lipocalin-2
on cells, 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 [wild-type
KRAS] and PANC-1 [KRAS mutation]) and 1 wild-type
p53 normal fibroblast cell line (MRC5) were infected
with ZD55-lipocalin-2 and ZD55 at various multiplicities of infection. Five days later, the cells were stained
with crystal violet, and significant cytopathic effects were
observed.

mice at ages 4 to 5 weeks. When the tumor size reached
100 to 150 mm3, the animals were randomized into 3
groups with 10 mice per group. Adenovirus at daily dose
of 5  108 plaque-forming units in 100 lL PBS or PBS
alone was injected intratumorally for 4 days. Tumor
volumes were measured and calculated according to the
following formula: (length  width2)  0.5. All animals
were maintained in accordance with institutional, United
Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research,
and National Institutes of Health guidelines.
In Situ Cell Apoptosis Detection by Terminal
Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated
Deoxyuridine Triphosphate Nick-End Labeling

Tumor specimens were fixed, processed, and embedded.
Deparaffinized tumor sections were used in this test, and
hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Cell apoptosis in
tumors was detected in situ in resected tissues by enzymatic labeling of DNA strand breaks with a terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine
triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

Colony-Formation Assay

PANC-1 cells (5  103 cells) that had been treated with
the different adenoviruses were replated onto 6-well
plates. Before incubation, the cells were washed 3 times in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After a 9-day incubation, the cells were fixed in methanol and stained with
0.5% crystal violet. Visible colonies were photographed.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.
40 ,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole and Propidium
Iodide Staining and Flow Cytometry

To determine the apoptotic effect, PANC-1 cells plated in
6-well plates were treated with the adenoviruses. Cells
were stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
and propidium iodide (PI), and the fraction of cells in
sub-G1 phase was determined using flow cytometry.
Annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometry also
were performed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, East Rutherford, NJ).
Western Blot Analysis

Cells infected with virus or mock-infected cells were harvested from the plates. Western blot analyses were done as
previously described.12 Antibodies against b-actin, E1A,
E1B55-kDa, caspase-3, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, Calif).
Antitumor Efficacy in Xenograft Tumors

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS for
Windows statistical software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill). All continuous data are presented as means 
standard deviations. Categorical variables were compared
using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. Independent-sample t tests or analyses of variance were used to
compare mean values between different groups. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and
differences in survival were compared using the log-rank
test; P values < .05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Relations Between Lipocalin-2 Expression and
Patient Prognosis

Immunohistochemical staining revealed that lipocalin-2
was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of primary pancreatic
cancer cells. The positive expression rate of lipocalin-2 was
81.6% in 60 primary pancreatic cancer samples. Weak or
negative expression of lipocalin-2 occurred in normal pancreatic tissues and lymph node metastasis. The 5-year survival rate was 0% for patients who had lipocalin-2–negative
tumors and 23%, for patients who had lipocalin-2–positive
tumors. Univariate analysis indicated that positive expression of lipocalin-2 was associated with a high survival rate
in patients with pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1)

Figure 1. A Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival (Cum Survival)
analysis is illustrated in patients with pancreatic cancer
according to the expression of lipocalin-2. The prognosis for
patients in the lipocalin-2-positive group was better than that
for patients in the lipocalin-2-negative group (P ¼ .028). The
mean survival was 12.11 months (95% confidence interval [CI],
7.22-17.0 months) in the lipocalin-2 negative group and 30.33
months (95% CI, 20.28-40.37 months) in the lipocalin-2-positive group.

Univariate analysis also was performed to investigate
the relation between lipocalin-2 expression and clinicopathologic features. Clinicopathologic characteristics that
were analyzed included histologic grade of tumor differentiation, tumor size, tumor stage, etc. The analysis indicated that positive lipocalin-2 expression was associated
with negative lymph node metastasis (P ¼ .03) or earlier
TNM stage (P ¼ .03) (Table.1).
Construction and Characteristics of
ZD55-Lipocalin-2

ZD55 was constructed as described in our previous
report.30 The lipocalin-2 gene was inserted into ZD55 to
form ZD55-lipocalin-2. Then, 1300 base-pair (bp) DNA
fragments were detected in products of Bgl II-digested
pZD55-lipocalin-2. Approximately 700 bp DNA fragments were amplified from pZD55-lipocalin-2 by PCR.
Homologous recombination was carried out between
pZD55-lipocalin-2 and pBHGE3 in HEK293 cells to
obtain ZD55-lipocalin-2. Approximately 1450 bp DNA
products were detected from ZD55-lipocalin-2 DNA by
PCR using sense and antisense ZD55 primers.30 Approximately 700 bp bands occurred in the PCR-amplified
products from ZD55-lipocalin-2 DNA using primers for
lipocalin-2. Wester blot results also showed ZD55-lipocalin-2 expressed E1A and lipocalin-2 proteins, but failed to

express E1B-55kDa protein. These results suggested that
the construction of ZD55-lipocalin-2 was correct.

ZD55-Mediated Adenovirus Replicates in
PANC-1 Cells

PANC-1 cells were infected with the same titer of AdEGFP and ZD55-EGFP, and the fluorescence intensity
of EGFP in PANC-1 cells infected with ZD55-EGFP
increased over time. In contrast, fluorescence intensity
was much weaker in PANC-1 cells that were infected with
Ad-EGFP. A viral production assay indicated that the
reproductive activity of ZD55-lipocalin-2 in PANC-1
cells was dramatically higher than that in normal NHFL1 cells.

Reduction of Colony Formation Induced by
ZD55-Lipocalin-2

PANC-1 cells (5  103 cells) infected with ZD55-lipocalin-2, Ad-lipocalin-2, and ZD55-EGFP were plated, and
colony-formation assays were performed 9 days after plating. The colony numbers in ZD55-lipocalin-2–infected
cells were the lowest of the 3 groups.

Figure 2. (A) Tumor growth curves are illustrated. Xenografts were treated with an intratumoral injection of a lipocalin-2-expressing oncolytic adenovirus (ZD55-lipocalin-2), with ZD55 alone (ZD55), or with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tumor growth
was inhibited dramatically in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group. (B) Cumulative survival (Cum Survival) was analyzed with the log-rank
test (Mantel-Cox model). The mean survival (standard deviation) was 28.2  1.7 days in the PBS group, 41.8  1.7 days in the
ZD55 group, and 47.5  0.42 days in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group. The prognosis for mice in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group was the
best among the 3 groups. A star indicates P < .01 compared with the PBS group; cross with dots, P < .05 compared with the
ZD55 group.

Cytopathic Effects and Growth Inhibition of
ZD55-Lipocalin-2 In Vitro

Cytopathic effects were observed by crystal violet staining.
The cell-killing effect of ZD55-lipocalin-2 was greater
than that of ZD55 in vitro, and the cell-killing effect of
ZD55-lipocalin-2 was stronger against PANC-1 cells
than against BxPC-3 cells. However, both ZD55-lipocalin-2 and ZD55 caused limited cell death in MRC5 cells.
MTT experiments demonstrated that the viability of
PANC-1 cells infected with ZD55-lipocalin-2 decreased
in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of tumor cells from ZD55-lipocalin-2
was much stronger than that from the control group. Adlipocalin-2 also had antitumor effects associated with its
concentration and its infection time.
Antitumor Efficacy of ZD55-Lipocalin-2 in Vivo

Pancreatic cancer xenografts were established and randomly divided into 3 groups. There was no significant
difference in the baseline tumor volume between the
different groups in a 1-way analysis of variance (P ¼
.893). Tumors that were treated with ZD55-lipocalin-2
Cancer

exhibited significant growth inhibition compared with
tumors that were treated with ZD55. Both ZD55-lipocalin-2 and ZD55 had significant antitumor efficacy (Fig.
2A). In particular, 2 tumor xenografts in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group were completely eradicated 20 days after
treatment. In survival analysis, failure was defined as the
death of an animal or a tumor volume >550 mm.3 The
results indicated that the prognosis for the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group was best among the 3 groups (P < .05), and
the prognosis for the ZD55 group was better than that for
the PBS group (P < .05) (Fig. 2B).
Apoptosis Induced by ZD55-Lipocalin-2

Apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry and DAPI
staining to determine whether growth inhibition was associated with apoptosis induced by ZD55-lipocalin-2. By
using annexin V/PI double staining, flow cytometry data
can detect early (labeled with annexin V alone) and late
(labeled with annexin V/PI) apoptotic cells. Our data
demonstrated that the early apoptotic rate of cells treated
with ZD55-lipocalin-2 increased significantly compared
with the rate of control cells. The fraction of cells in sub5221

cells were infected with the typical, nonreplicative lipocalin-2 adenovirus (Ad-lipocalin-2); with a lipocalin-2-expressing oncolytic
adenovirus (ZD55-lipocalin-2); or with ZD55 alone (ZD55). Forty-eight hours later, the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ). Results indicate that the rate of apoptosis in the Ad-lipocalin-2 group and the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group was much higher than that in the ZD55 group. An asterisk indicates P < .05
compared with the ZD55 group. (B) PANC-1 cells that were treated with the indicated viruses were collected and incubated with
PI. Sub-G1 cells were observed in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group. (D) 40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining is observed in this series
of photomicrographs. Apoptotic cells had shrunken shapes and small, pyknotic nuclei (arrows; original magnification, 400).

G1 phase in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group was much
greater than that in the other groups. DAPI staining
revealed shrunken cell shapes and small, pyknotic nuclei
in PANC-1 cells that were infected with ZD55-lipocalin2, but not in normal cells or in PANC-1 cells that were
infected with ZD55 (Fig. 3). A TUNEL assay also
revealed that ZD55-lipocalin-2 dramatically induced
more apoptotic cell death and necrosis in tumors (Fig. 4).

ZD55-lipocalin-2 decreased in a time-dependent manner.
The level of cleaved PARP in PANC-1 cells infected with
ZD55-lipocalin-2 for 48 hours increased in a dosedependent manner. Cleaved PARP occurred in cells that

time. (B) Levels of cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and PARP are observed. More cleaved PARP and less PARP were
detected in the group that was treated with ZD55-lipocalin-2 compared with the groups that were treated with the typical nonreplicative adenovirus (Ad-lipocalin-2) or with the ZD55 virus alone (ZD55). Moreover, in the ZD55-lipocalin-2 group, the level of
cleaved PARP increased with elevated concentrations of ZD55-lipocalin-2. 10MOI indicates a multiplicity of infection of 10.

DISCUSSION
There have been no major breakthroughs in early detection or effective treatments for pancreatic cancer during
the last 20 years. Most pancreatic cancers remain untreatable or develop secondary resistance to the existing

treatments. A high rate of KRAS mutations (approximately 90%)17 in pancreatic cancer has dramatically contributed to the incidence of refractory disease. Therefore,
it is crucial to develop new therapies for patients who have
pancreatic cancer with KRAS mutations.
Oncolytic viruses, which have been evaluated in several clinical trials,31,32 are emerging as attractive anticancer
agents. Approximately 50% of patients with pancreatic
cancer achieved favorable outcomes in a phase 2 clinical
trial using the E1B-deleted adenovirus ONYX-015.33
CRAd-Cans, another E1B55-deleted oncolytic adenovirus,
greatly inhibited the growth of BxPC-3 cells.34 However,
the CTGVT strategy combines the advantages of gene therapy with oncolytic virus therapy and, thus, produces much
better antitumor effects than either therapy alone. Lipocalin-2 is a multifaceted protein; however, it can inhibit the
proneoplastic factor heat inducible factor-1a, focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, and vascular endothelial
growth factor synthesis in RAS-transformed cells.23,35-38
The antitumor effects of lipocalin-2 in pancreatic cancer
reportedly may be because of its ability to block invasion
and angiogenesis.39,40 Our clinical data indicated that the
positive rate of lipocalin-2 expression in early stage disease
was greater than that in advanced disease. The prognosis
for our lipocalin-2–negative group was poorer than that in
our lipocalin-2–positive group. These data suggested that
greater expression of lipocalin-2 was associated with earlier
tumor stages and a better prognosis. These findings supported the potential of combined therapy with lipocalin-2
and an oncolytic virus in the CTGVT strategy as a good
way to treat pancreatic cancer.
Our data indicated that the antitumor efficacy of
ZD55-lipocalin-2 was dose-dependent and time-dependent. Both ZD55 and Ad-lipocalin-2 had antitumor efficacy in pancreatic cancer, but growth inhibition with
ZD55-lipocalin-2 was greater than that with either ZD55
or Ad-lipocalin-2 alone. The antitumor activity of ZD55lipocalin-2 was stronger in PANC-1 cells (KRAS mutated
cells41) than in BxPC-3 cells (wild-type KRAS cells41,42).
Because the clinical results indicated that lipocalin-2–negative pancreatic cancers had a poorer prognosis and that
pancreatic cancers with KRAS mutations always were refractory to current chemotherapies and radiotherapies,
our in vivo studies targeted lipocalin-2–negative pancreatic cancer cells with KRAS mutations. In a PANC-1 tumor xenograft nude mouse model, ZD55-lipocalin-2 had
the greatest ability to inhibit tumor growth among the 3
groups. These data suggested that ZD55-lipocalin-2 may
be very useful for pancreatic cancer therapy, especially in
tumors with KRAS mutations.

Why did ZD55-lipocalin-2 have stronger therapeutic effects than Ad-lipocalin-2 or ZD55? We believe that
the inserted lipocalin-2 gene can over express several hundred-fold through accompanying ZD55-lipocalin-2 replication in pancreatic cancer cells, making the antitumor
effect of ZD55-lipocalin-2 much greater than that of Adlipocalin-2 or ZD55 alone. Our data clearly demonstrated
that sub-G1 phase or pyknotic nuclei occurred in PANC1 cells infected with ZD55-lipocalin-2, but none or few
occurred in cells infected with Ad-lipocalin-2 or ZD55.
Moreover, TUNEL staining revealed that the percentage
of apoptotic cells and the amount of necrosis in the
ZD55-lipocalin-2 group were much greater than those in
the ZD55 group or in the PBS control group. It has been
reported that the interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme/caspase family plays a crucial role in apoptosis.43 In particular, caspase-3 is a key component of the apoptotic
mechanism.44,45 ZD55-lipocalin-2 had stronger power to
activate PARP and casapse-3 than Ad-lipocalin-2 or
ZD55. Thus, the combined antitumor effects of ZD55lipocalin-2, originating from apoptosis because of lipocalin-2 overexpression, and cancer cells lysis, caused by
oncolytic virus replication, kill pancreatic cancer cells
effectively.
Liver metastases are a common finding in pancreatic cancer. Usually, if there is evidence of liver metastases, surgery will not be an option. Moreover,
postoperative liver metastases are frequent events and
are the leading cause of death in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our current results indicate that ZD55-lipocalin-2 may be a promising clinical agent in the
future. Especially for patients who undergo the removal
of a primary tumor but have disease accompanied by a
solitary hepatic metastasis and immunohistochemistry
results indicating a KRAS mutation in the primary tumor, the administration of ZD55-lipocalin-2 by using
a technique like transcatheter arterial chemoembolization may be very useful for the prevention and treatment of liver metastasis.
In summary, although lipocalin-2 is a controversial
modulator in cancer progression,46-48 the current results
clearly indicate that lipocalin-2 has antitumor effects in
pancreatic cancer. ZD55-lipocalin-2 provides excellent
antitumor effects in pancreatic cancer. It mediates greater
caspase-dependent apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells
compared with Ad-lipocalin-2 (the typical gene therapy)
or ZD55 (the typical oncolytic virus therapy). It may serve
as a potent anticancer drug for pancreatic cancer therapy,
especially for patients who have pancreatic adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutations.
