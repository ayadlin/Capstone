Abstract
Betulinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpene natural product
initially identified as a melanoma-specific cytotoxic agent that
exhibits low toxicity in animal models. Subsequent studies
show that betulinic acid induces apoptosis and antiangiogenic
responses in tumors derived from multiple tissues; however,
the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. Using LNCaP
prostate cancer cells as a model, we now show that betulinic
acid decreases expression of vascular endothelial growth
(VEGF) and the antiapoptotic protein survivin. The mechanism of these betulinic acid–induced antiangiogenic and
proapoptotic responses in both LNCaP cells and in tumors is
due to activation of selective proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factors specificity protein 1 (Sp1),
Sp3, and Sp4, which regulate VEGF and survivin expression.
Thus, betulinic acid acts as a novel anticancer agent through
targeted degradation of Sp proteins that are highly overexpressed in tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2816–23]

Introduction
Natural products derived from plant sources have been used
extensively in traditional medicine for treatment of a myriad of
diseases including various types of cancers (1–3). Several individual
phytochemicals or their synthetic analogues are among the most
widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, and these include
taxane microtubule inhibitors, such as paclitaxel, and synthetic
analogues that are now widely used in cancer chemotherapy (4, 5).
Phytochemical and microbial extracts from various sources are
routinely screened for biological activities, and it is estimated that
20% to 25% of new drugs are derived from natural products or their
synthetic analogues (1, 6, 7). The triterpenoids oleanolic acid,
ursolic acid, and their derivatives exhibit anti-inflammatory and
anticarcinogenic activities (8–10). Structure-activity studies among
several oleanolic and ursolic acid derivatives (11–13) have
identified 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)
and related compounds as highly potent anti-inflammatory
compounds that inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in several
cancer cells and tumor types (8, 14–18). CDDO-like compounds act
through multiple pathways and are currently undergoing clinical
trials for treatment of leukemia.
Betulin is a lupane-derived triterpene that is present in high
concentrations in birch bark and betulinic acid; an oxidation
product of betulin has also been detected in bark extracts (19).

Betulinic acid was initially characterized as a highly selective
inhibitor of human melanoma cell and tumor growth through
induction of apoptosis (20). Subsequent research has shown that
betulinic acid and other derivatives are effective inhibitors of cell
proliferation and induce apoptosis in many different cancer cells.
However, the underlying mechanisms for these responses are not
well understood.
In this study, we show that betulinic acid decreased proliferation
of several cancer cell lines, including SK-MEL2 melanoma cells, and
using LNCaP prostate cancer cells as a model, we determined a
unique mechanism of action of this compound. Betulinic acid
modulates expression of several growth-related proteins and
decreases expression of the proangiogenic and proapoptotic
proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and survivin,
respectively. Previous reports show that in some cancer cell lines,
VEGF and survivin expression is dependent, in part, on specificity
protein (Sp) proteins (21–29), and Sp1 is overexpressed in cancer
cells and tumors (30–34). Results of this study now show that
betulinic acid induces proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1,
Sp3, and Sp4 in LNCaP cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 not
only blocked betulinic acid–induced degradation of Sp proteins but
also inhibited the decreased expression of VEGF and survivin in
cells treated with betulinic acid. In vivo studies showed that
betulinic acid inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice
bearing LNCaP cell xenografts, and this was accompanied by
decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins and VEGF and
increased apoptosis in tumors from betulinic acid–treated mice.
The results indicate that the antitumorigenic effects of betulinic
acid are associated with targeted degradation of Sp transcription
factors that are overexpressed in many tumors, and this results in
activation of proapoptotic and antiangiogenic responses in tumor
but not in non-target tissues (e.g., liver) that exhibit low Sp protein
expression.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, antibodies, plasmids, and reagents. Betulinic acid and
h-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and
proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp4, Sp3, VEGF, CD1, AR, KLF6, survivin, and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and CD31 antibody was obtained from
DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). The pVEGF-2018 and pVEGF-133
constructs contain VEGF promoter inserts (positions 2018 to +50 and
positions 131 to +54, respectively) linked to luciferase reporter gene (22).
The pSurvivin-269 and pSurvivin-150 were kindly provided by Dr. M. Zhou
(Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Reporter lysis buffer and luciferase reagent
for luciferase studies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).
h-Galactosidase (h-gal) reagent was obtained from Tropix (Bedford, MA).
LipofectAMINE reagent was supplied by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Western
lightning chemiluminescence reagent was from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences
(Boston, MA).

Betulinic Acid Induces Sp Protein Degradation
Cell lines. Human carcinoma cell lines LNCaP (prostate) and SK-MEL2
(melanoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) supplemented with 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 0.011% sodium
pyruvate, 0.45% glucose, 0.24% HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10
mL/L of 100 antibiotic antimycotic solution (Sigma). Cells were
maintained at 37jC in the presence of 5% CO2.
Cell proliferation assay. Prostate and melanoma cancer cells (2  104
per well) were plated in 12-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. The
medium was then changed to DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium containing 2.5%
charcoal-stripped FBS, and either vehicle (DMSO) or different concentrations of the compound were added. Fresh medium and compounds were
added every 48 h, and cells were then trypsinized and counted after 48 and
96 h using a Coulter Z1 cell counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate,
and results are expressed as means F SE for each set of experiments.
Transfection and luciferase assay. Prostate cancer cells were plated
in 12-well plates at 1  105 per well in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 media
supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After growth for 16 to
20 h, various amounts of reporter gene constructs [i.e., pVEGF-2018 (0.4 Ag),
pVEGF-133 (0.04 Ag), pSurvivin-269 (0.04 Ag), pSurvivin-150 (0.04 Ag), and
h-gal (0.04 Ag)] were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 5 h of transfection, the transfection
mix was replaced with complete media containing either vehicle (DMSO) or
the indicated compound for 20 to 22 h. Cells were then lysed with 100 AL of
1 reporter lysis buffer, and 30 AL of cell extract were used for luciferase
and h-gal assays. Lumicount was used to quantitate luciferase and h-gal
activities, and the luciferase activities were normalized to h-gal activity.
Western blotting. An equal amount of cell lysate (60 Ag per well) was
separated by 7.5% to 12% SDS-PAGE, which was followed by immunoblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After blocking
in TBST-Blotto [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8), 0.05% Triton
X-100, 5% nonfat dry milk] for 30 min, the membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4jC and then with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Proteins were
visualized using the chemiluminescence substrate (Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences) for 1 min and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR autoradiography
film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY).

Xenograft study. Male athymic BALB/c nude mice (age 4–6 weeks) were
purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). LNCaP cells (1  106) were
implanted with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) s.c. into the flank of
each mouse. Ten days after cell inoculation, animals were divided into three
equal groups of 10 mice each. The first group received 100 AL vehicle
(1% DMSO in corn oil) by oral gavage, and the second and third groups of
animals received 10 and 20 mg/kg/d doses of betulinic acid in vehicle every
second day for 14 days (seven doses). The mice were weighed, and tumor
areas were measured throughout the study. After 22 days, the animals were
sacrificed; final body and tumor weights were determined; and selected
tissues were further examined by routine H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections (4–5 Am thick) mounted on
poly-L-lysine–coated slide were deparaffinized by standard methods.
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by the use of 3% hydrogen peroxide
in PBS for 10 min. Antigen retrieval for VEGF and CD31 staining was done for
10 min in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) heated at 95jC in a steamer
followed by cooling for 15 min. The slides were washed with PBS and
incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a protein blocking solution
(VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Excess
blocking solution was drained, and the samples were incubated overnight at
4jC with one of the following: a 1:100 dilution of VEGF antibody or a 1:40
dilution of CD31 antibody. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibody followed by streptavidin (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit).
The color was developed by exposing the peroxidase to diaminobenzidine
reagent (Vector Laboratories), which forms a brown reaction product. The
sections were then counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin. VEGF and CD31
expression was identified by the brown cytoplasmic staining. H&E staining
was determined as previously described (26).

of betulinic acid. The antiproliferative effects of betulinic acid
were initially investigated in SK-MEL2 melanoma and LNCaP
prostate cancer cells, and 6-day IC50 values for growth inhibition
were 5 to 10 Amol/L and 1 to 5 Amol/L, respectively. Similar results

were observed for pancreatic (Panc28 and L3.6pl), bladder (KU7),
and colon (SW480), cancer cells (data not shown). Cell survival
curves for LNCaP and SK-MEL2 cells after treatment for 48 or
96 h are illustrated in Fig. 1A and B. At higher concentrations of
betulinic acid (z10 Amol/L), there was an overall decrease in the
number of cells remaining compared with the number of initially
seeded cells, which was consistent with the cytotoxicity of betulinic
acid.
We further investigated the effects of betulinic acid on growthinhibitory and proapoptotic proteins using LNCaP cells as a model.
Results illustrated in Fig. 1C show that relatively short-term
exposure (24 h) to betulinic acid (z10 Amol/L) induced downregulation of cyclin D1, whereas the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors p21 and p27 were expressed at low levels in these cells
and were not affected by the treatment (data not shown). AR
expression in LNCaP cells was decreased after treatment with
5 Amol/L betulinic acid, and this protein was almost completely
absent in cells treated with 10 Amol/L concentrations. Recent
studies have shown that AR knockdown by RNA interference in
LNCaP cells resulted in induction of apoptosis (35), suggesting that
the proapoptotic effects of betulinic acid in LNCaP cells may be
due, in part, to the effects on AR expression. However, this
mechanism would not be applicable to melanoma and other
cancer cell lines that are AR independent. The tumor suppressor
gene KLF6 was also induced by betulinic acid at concentrations
between 10 and 15 Amol/L. Betulinic acid also induced caspasedependent PARP cleavage in LNCaP cells, and this was accompanied by decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin
(Fig. 1D) and induction of DNA laddering (data not shown)

typically observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. In addition,
betulinic acid also decreased expression of the angiogenic protein
VEGF.
Betulinic acid induces proteasome-dependent degradation
of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins. Previous studies in this laboratory
have shown that both basal and hormone-induced expression of
VEGF in cancer cell lines is dependent on Sp protein expression
(22–24, 26), and regulation of survivin in some cells is also
dependent on these transcription factors (27–30). Moreover,
because Sp proteins are up-regulated in many tumors/cancer cells
(31–34) and are associated with proliferative, angiogenic, and
antiapoptotic pathways, we hypothesized that the anticarcinogenic
activity of betulinic acid may be due, in part, to down-regulation of
Sp proteins. Results in Fig. 2A show that treatment of LNCaP cells
with 5 to 10 Amol/L betulinic acid for 24 h induced downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins, and this was also
accompanied by decreased expression of VEGF and survivin
(Fig. 1D). The time-dependent decrease of Sp proteins in LNCaP
cells treated with 15 Amol/L betulinic acid for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and
24 h showed that lower expression of these proteins is first
observed after treatment for 12 h (Fig. 2B). Prolonged treatment of
LNCaP cells with betulinic acid for 48 or 72 h showed that Sp
protein degradation and PARP cleavage can be observed at doses
as low as 1 to 2.5 Amol/L (Fig. 2C). Figure 2D illustrates that
betulinic acid also decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4
proteins in SK-MEL2 melanoma cancer cells, and similar results
were obtained in other cancer lines (data not shown).
Because betulinic acid induces degradation of Sp proteins within
12 h after treatment (Fig. 2B), we investigated the possible role of

Betulinic Acid Induces Sp Protein Degradation

induced protein(s) in mediating this response by treating LNCaP
cells with betulinic acid alone (10–20 Amol/L) or in the presence of
10 Ag/mL cycloheximide (Fig. 3A). The protein synthesis inhibitor
did not modulate the effects of betulinic acid on Sp protein levels.
Previous studies showed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors,
the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug tolfenamic acid, and
related compounds induced proteasome-dependent degradation of
Sp proteins (23, 26); therefore, we investigated the effects of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 on betulinic acid–induced downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and VEGF in LNCaP cells. MG132
reversed the effects of betulinic acid on expression of these
transcription factors (Fig. 3B). Betulinic acid selectively induced
proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp proteins and cyclin D1 in
LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C); however, MG132 did not modulate
expression of h-actin or reverse betulinic acid–dependent downregulation of AR, which is due to decreased AR RNA expression
(data not shown). MG132 (10 Amol/L) and other proteasome
inhibitors induced caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP in LNCaP
cells; however, MG132 also partially inhibited betulinic acid–induced
apoptosis. Moreover, using a lower concentration of MG132
(5 Amol/L), the effects of the compound alone on PARP cleavage
were decreased, but in combination with betulinic acid, there was
inhibition of betulinic acid–induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D). MG132
also blocked betulinic acid–induced down-regulation of survivin
protein (Fig. 3D), suggesting that Sp protein degradation plays a role
in the apoptosis-inducing effects of betulinic acid.
Betulinic acid inhibits VEGF and survivin promoter expression through proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp proteins. Expression of both VEGF and survivin in some cancer cell
lines is regulated by Sp protein interactions with GC-rich promoter
sites (21, 29); therefore, the effects of betulinic acid on decreased

expression of VEGF and survivin through Sp protein degradation
was further investigated in transfection studies. The effects of
betulinic acid on transactivation was investigated in LNCaP cells
transfected with the pVEGF1 and pVEGF2 constructs containing
the 2068 to +50 and 133 to +50 VEGF gene promoter inserts.
Results in Fig. 4A and B show that betulinic acid decreased
luciferase activity in LNCaP cells transfected with pVEGF1 and
pVEGF2, and these effects were reversed by the proteasome
inhibitor MG132; similar results were observed using the
proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (data not shown). These observations further confirm that betulinic acid–induced degradation of
Sp proteins results in decreased VEGF expression in LNCaP cells,
and this is consistent with previous RNA interference studies
showing that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 regulate VEGF expression in cancer
cell lines (22).
Because the proteasome inhibitor MG132 partially blocks
betulinic acid–induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 3C and D), we further
investigated the role of Sp protein degradation on induction of
apoptosis by examining the effects of betulinic acid on transactivation in LNCaP cells transfected with the GC-rich pSurvivin269 and pSurvivin-150 constructs which contain the 269 to +49
and 150 to +49 survivin promoter inserts. Betulinic acid causes a
concentration-dependent decrease in luciferase activity that was
significantly reversed by 10 Amol/L MG132 (Fig. 4C and D). In
parallel studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assays also show that
lysates from betulinic acid–treated LNCaP cells exhibited decreased binding to GC-rich survivin sequences (data not shown).
These results complement a recent study showing that the DNAbinding drug hedamycin also decreases survivin expression
through inhibition of Sp protein interactions with the GC-rich
survivin promoter (29).

Betulinic acid inhibits tumor growth an athymic nude mice
bearing LNCaP cells as xenografts. Pisha et al. previously
reported that betulinic acid inhibits growth of tumors in athymic
nude mice bearing MEL-1 melanoma cells as xenografts (20).
Results in Fig. 5A show that 10 and 20 mg/kg/d betulinic acid
inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP cell xenografts, and
this was accompanied by significantly decreased tumor weights in
both treatment groups (Fig. 5B). Examination of the mice showed
that there were no treatment-related changes in organ or body
weights or in the histopathology of liver and other tissues (data not
shown), and this was consistent with the reported low toxicity of
this compounds (20). Representative H&E-stained histopathology
sections of prostate tumors from the control and treated mice were
examined. Tumors from untreated mice consisted of minimally
encapsulated (Fig. 5C, a), dense expansile nests of epithelial cells
with marked atypical features such as anisocytosis, anisokaryosis,
multiple variably sized nucleoli, nuclear molding, binucleation and
multinucleation. Bizarre mitotic figures were frequently noted
within the neoplastic cells (Fig. 5C, b, arrowheads). Abundant
vascular channels were frequently present within neoplastic cells
(Fig. 5C, b, arrows). Tumors from the treated mice consisted of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

neoplastic cells similar to that noted from the untreated mice.
However, the mitotic activity (1–2 microfigures per high-power
field compared with 6–8 microfigures per high-power field in the
corn oil group) and the epithelial atypia seemed to be decreased
(Fig. 5C, c). In addition, the tumor tissue was remarkably less
vascular with evidence for necrosis (Fig. 5C, d, area within box),
and this is consistent with the antiangiogenic effect of betulinic
acid through decreased expression of Sp proteins and VEGF.
Betulinic acid decreases Sp protein and VEGF expression in
tumors but not liver. We also compared expression of Sp proteins,
AR and VEGF, as well as PARP cleavage in tumor lysates from
control and betulinic acid–treated mice ( five animals per group) by
Western blot analysis using h-actin as a loading control. Relatively
high levels of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and VEGF proteins were observed in
the control tumors, and we did not detect PARP cleavage in protein
lysates from these tumors (Fig. 6A). In contrast, expression of Sp1,
Sp3, Sp4, AR, and VEGF proteins was decreased in tumors from
betulinic acid–treated mice, and PARP cleavage was observed. Sp
protein levels in liver from untreated or betulinic acid–treated mice
could be visualized only after prolonged exposures, and the pattern
of Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 protein expression was similar in both groups

vessel density), and the staining for both factors was decreased in
tumors from betulinic acid–treated mice (Fig. 6D). This study
shows that betulinic acid is a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer
cell and tumor growth, and this parallels results showing that
betulinic acid exhibited anticancer activity in in vitro and in vivo
models of melanoma (20). The underlying mechanisms of
proapoptotic, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic activities of
betulinic acid are associated with induction of proteasomedependent degradation of Sp proteins in prostate tumor cells.
Moreover, Sp protein expression was decreased in SK-MEL2
(Fig. 2D) and other cancer cell lines (data not shown), suggesting
that the betulinic acid–dependent down-regulation of Sp proteins
that is accompanied by both proapoptotic and antiangiogenic
responses is an integral part of the anticarcinogenic activity of this
compound.

tissues/organs from mice treated with corn oil or betulinic acid and
observed uniformly very low to nondetectable Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in
both treatment groups (data not shown). Tumors from untreated
and treated mice were also stained for VEGF and CD31 (micro-

Betulinic acid is a natural product identified in various bark
extracts and is readily synthesized from betulin, a major
component in bark from birch trees (19). Pisha et al. (20) initially
reported that this triterpenoid inhibited growth of several
melanoma cell lines, and ED50 values for cytotoxicity varied from
4.8 to 1.1 Ag/mL, whereas the corresponding values for a series of
colon, prostate, breast, lung, squamous, and glioma cancer cells
were >20 Ag/mL. However, other reports also show that betulinic
acid inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in several different
cancer cell lines (19), and this corresponds to results of this study
in which IC50 values (growth inhibition) for melanoma and
prostate cancer cells were 5 to 10 Amol/L and 1 to 5 Amol/L,
respectively, and similar results were obtained in other cancer cell
lines. It has also been reported that betulinic acid derivatives and
related lupane analogues are more cytotoxic than betulinic acid to
cancer cells (19); however, a major advantage in using the latter
compound for cancer chemotherapy is the low toxicity. Doses as
high as 500 mg/kg every 4th day (6) exhibited no detectable toxic
side effects (20).
It has been reported that betulinic acid induces apoptosis in
several different cancer cell lines through multiple pathways, which
include direct effects on the mitochondria accompanied by
decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, up-regulation of
death receptors, and interactions with other agents (36–47). In
addition, betulinic acid exhibits antiangiogenic activity in an
in vitro assay for tube-like structures in ECV304 cells (48); however,
the underlying mechanisms of action for these responses are
unknown. In this study, betulinic acid also induces proapoptotic
and antiangiogenic responses in LNCaP cells as evidenced by
decreased expression of VEGF and survivin and activation of
caspase-dependent PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D) and DNA laddering
(data not shown). Betulinic acid decreases AR expression in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 1C), and this response is in itself proapoptotic in this cell
line because it has been reported that decreased AR expression via
RNA interference results in increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells (35).
Previous studies show that in several cancer cell lines VEGF
expression is dependent, in part, on Sp1 and other Sp proteins
(23, 25), and there is also evidence that survivin expression is Sp
dependent (27–29). Therefore, we examined the effects of betulinic
acid on expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins in LNCaP cells,
and the results show for the first time that betulinic acid decreases
expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. Similar results are observed in
SK-MEL2 and other cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A–D).

Cancer Research

The role of betulinic acid–induced down-regulation of Sp
proteins in mediating the proapoptotic and antiangiogenic
activities of this compound were further investigated in LNCaP
cells. Proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, block Sp protein
degradation induced by COX-2 inhibitors and tolfenamic acid in
colon and pancreatic cancer cells (23, 37). The results in Fig. 2D
show that MG132 inhibited betulinic acid–induced degradation of
Sp proteins. Moreover, MG132 blocked degradation of VEGF and
survivin proteins in LNCaP cells treated with betulinic acid, and
similar results were observed for cyclin D1 but not AR (Fig. 3B–D),
which is decreased through proteasome-independent pathways.
Moreover, in LNCaP cells transfected with constructs containing
critical GC-rich sequences from the VEGF and survivin gene
promoters, betulinic acid decreased transactivation that was
inhibited after cotreatment with MG132 (Fig. 4). These results
confirm the linkage between the decreased expression of survivin
and VEGF in LNCaP cells treated with betulinic acid with
degradation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in this cell line.
Sp proteins are overexpressed in many human tumors and cell
lines (30–34); therefore, these transcription factors are potential
targets for development of drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Lou
et al. (49) reported that transformation of fibroblasts resulted in an
8- to 18-fold increase in Sp1 expression, and these transformed cells
formed highly malignant tumors in athymic nude mouse xenograft
models, whereas fibroblasts expressing low levels of Sp1 did not
form tumors. In addition, ribozyme-dependent knockdown of Sp1
in the transformed cells decreased VEGF expression and increased
apoptosis. Results in Fig. 5 clearly showed that betulinic acid
(10 and 20 mg/kg/d) inhibited tumor growth and final tumor
weights in athymic nude mice bearing LNCaP cells as xenografts.

Moreover, examination of individual tumors clearly showed that
Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins were highly expressed in tumors from
control animals, whereas there was a marked decreased in
expression of these proteins in tumors from mice treated with
betulinic acid (Fig. 6A). Decreased VEGF expression also paralleled
decreased Sp protein levels in tumors from betulinic acid–treated
animals, although the magnitude of decreased VEGF was lower
than that observed for Sp proteins in the latter treatment group.
The antiangiogenic activity of betulinic acid was confirmed by
decreased VEGF and CD31 staining in tumors from betulinic acid–
versus corn oil–treated mice (Fig. 6D), and this was consistent with
the antiangiogenic activity previously reported for betulinic acid
(48). H&E staining also showed that the vascularity of tumors in
mice treated with betulinic acid was significantly lower than in
tumors from corn oil–treated mice (Fig. 5C).
We also examined Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein expression in nontumor tissue from control and betulinic acid–treated mice, and
levels were barely detectable to nondetectable in both treatment
groups; however, when gels were overexposed, it was evident that
levels of Sp protein expression were similar in liver lysates from
control and betulinic acid–treated mice (Fig. 6B and C). These
results suggest that activation of proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp proteins by betulinic acid may be specific for cancer cells
and tumors that overexpress these transcription factors to gain a
growth and metastatic advantage over normal tissue. The critical
role for Sp proteins in regulating expression of antiapoptotic and
proangiogenic genes/proteins in tumors is supported by results of
this study that also highlights the efficacy of anticancer drugs that
target specific transcription factors, such as Sp proteins, that are
overexpressed in tumors. The effects of betulinic acid in this study

were also observed for the closely related derivative betulonic acid
(data not shown), and we conclude that betulinic acid and similar
derivatives represent a novel class of transcription factor–targeting
anticancer drugs. Moreover, because betulinic acid induces many
other cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects in cancer cell lines
(36–47), it is likely that down-regulation of Sp proteins differentially contributes to the overall effect of this compound. Current
studies with betulinic acid are investigating tumor-type similarities
and differences in its mechanism of action and the development of
