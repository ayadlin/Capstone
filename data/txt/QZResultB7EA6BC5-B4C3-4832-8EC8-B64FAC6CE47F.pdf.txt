Abstract
Our recent study identified 2,261 dysregulated genes in the
esophagi of rats that received a 1-week exposure to the
carcinogen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). We further
reported that 1,323 of these genes were positively modulated
to near-normal levels of expression in NMBA-treated animals
that consumed dietary phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a
constituent of cruciferous vegetables. Herein, we report our
results with companion animals that were fed a diet
containing 5% freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) instead
of PEITC. We found that 462 of the 2,261 NMBA-dysregulated
genes in rat esophagus were restored to near-normal levels of
expression by BRB. Further, we have identified 53 NMBAdysregulated genes that are positively modulated by both
PEITC and BRB. These 53 common genes include genes
involved in phase I and II metabolism, oxidative damage, and
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycling, and angiogenesis. Because both PEITC and
BRB maintain near-normal levels of expression of these 53
genes, their dysregulation during the early phase of NMBAinduced esophageal cancer may be especially important in the
genesis of the disease. [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6460–7]

Introduction
Worldwide, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the
sixth most prevalent cancer in humans. Due to a lack of symptoms
during the early stages of the disease, ESCC is rarely detected until
it has metastasized (1). Tobacco products, alcohol, and inadequate
diet are primary causes of ESCC; thus, in addition to promoting
the lifestyle changes of smoking cessation and alcohol moderation,
there is a need to identify foods and food constituents that
inhibit or prolong the onset of clinical disease (2, 3). The F344 rat
esophagus bioassay model (3), in which tumors can be induced
by nitrosamine carcinogens such as N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine
(NMBA), has long been used to identify foods and food constituents with anticarcinogenic activity. These studies have identified
two dissimilar food groups, cruciferous vegetables and berries, to
be potent inhibitors of rat esophageal tumors induced by NMBA

(4, 5). The former contains numerous chemopreventive agents,
including the isothiocyanates, and the latter contains high amounts
of polyphenols and ellagitannins. The most extensively studied
isothiocyanate is phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which
owes its prevention properties, at least in part, to inhibition of
carcinogen-activating cytochrome P450 enzymes and induction
of carcinogen-detoxifying phase II enzymes (6, 7). Regarding
the polyphenols, we originally found that a diet supplemented
with ellagic acid was preventative in the rat esophagus (8). Subsequently, we identified blackberries, raspberries, black raspberries
(BRB), strawberries, and cranberries as being exceptionally rich in
ellagic acid, with dry weight concentrations ranging from 630 to
1,500 Ag/g (9). Further analyses showed that the ellagic acid was
most abundant in the pulp and seeds of berries, with little in the
juice. The pulp and seeds also contain many other known chemopreventive agents, including vitamins A, C, and E and folic acid,
calcium and selenium, h-carotene, a-carotene, lutein, gallic acid,
ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, several anthocyanins,
h-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and kaempferol (4, 10, 11). Importantly,
we also found that the active constituents can be concentrated
9- to 10-fold relative to the fresh berry by freeze drying (11). BRBs
for the present study were obtained from a single Ohio farm, freeze
dried, and ground into a powder as described (11). Typically, the
berries are not grown organically; however, no pesticides or fungicides are applied to the berries within 10 days before harvest. This
results in nondetectable levels of any pesticides or fungicides in the
berry powder due to biodegradation of these compounds during
the 10-day period before harvest.
The conversion of a normal cell into a tumorigenic cell is driven
by numerous molecular aberrations that arise over time that
endow the ultimate cell with resistance to apoptosis, insensitivity
to growth-inhibitory signals, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion/metastasis capabilities
(12). The time line of these events in the rat esophagus model
covers several months. We recently began delineating the genes
dysregulated early in this carcinogenesis process and have reported
that treatment of rats with three s.c. injections (0.5 mg/kg body
weight) of NMBA over 1 week led to the dysregulation of 2,261
genes (13). We also reported that the expression of 1,323 of these
genes was positively modulated if the animals were fed PEITC
2 weeks before and during the week of NMBA treatment. Herein,
we have evaluated the esophagi of companion animals in the same
protocol whose diet was supplemented with 5% freeze-dried
BRBs, instead of PEITC, for 2 weeks before and during the week
the animals were treated with NMBA. We found that 462 of the
NMBA-dysregulated genes were restored to near-normal levels of
expression by BRB. Interestingly, we found that 53 of the 2,261
genes dysregulated by NMBA were expressed at control levels of

transcription if the animals received either PEITC or BRB. These
common genes include those involved in phase I and II metabolism, oxidative damage, and oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycling, and angiogenesis.
Overall, our study has identified a unique collection of 53 genes
whose early dysregulation may be especially important in the
carcinogenesis of rat ESCC.

Materials and Methods
The procedures for determining the effects of dietary PEITC and BRB on
gene expression in NMBA-treated rat esophagus have been described in
detail in our companion report (13); thus, they are discussed only briefly
here. Four- to 5-wk-old male Fischer F344 rats were randomized into three
experimental groups of 18 animals each. Rats in group 1 received control
AIN-76A diet. Those in group 2 were given AIN-76A + PEITC (5 Amol) and
those in group 3 were given AIN-76A + 5% BRB. After 2 wk, one half of the
animals in group 1 received three s.c. injections of 20% DMSO/water
(vehicle control) spaced every other day, and the other half received three
s.c. injections of NMBA (0.5 mg/kg body weight in 20% DMSO/water).
Similarly, one half of the animals in groups 2 and 3 were divided into PEITC
control and PEITC+NMBA subgroups and BRB control and BRB+NMBA
subgroups, respectively. PEITC, at 5 Amol in the diet, reduces NMBAinduced tumors in the rat esophagus by f100% and BRB, at 5% of the diet,
causes an approximate 50% reduction in esophageal tumors (5). All rats
were sacrificed 24 h after the last NMBA injection. The esophagus from
each animal was excised, opened longitudinally, and cut into two parts. One
part was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for routine histopathology, and the
other was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC for analysis of
transcription changes using rat microarrays (41,000 transcripts). Triplicate
microarrays were completed for each of the six groups of nine rats for a
total of 18 microarrays.
Normalized data for each microarray were imported into Rosetta
Resolver (14) for analysis (version 5.1.0.1.23; Rossetta Biosoftware). ANOVA
was performed on log ratios using the Rosetta Resolver error model and
weighting, as described by Weng and colleagues (15). One-way ANOVA was
used to identify genes with a significant treatment effect. A P value cutoff of
0.001 was used to determine statistical significance in each treatment
comparison. Statistically significant genes were further filtered to identify
those with a minimum 1.5-fold change (16, 17). Gene ontology and pathway
analysis of differentially expressed genes was done using the DAVID
program.4 Microarray results were confirmed by comparison with mRNA
levels obtained by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using
selected gene-specific primer pairs for a total of eight genes as described
in our companion report (13). For each of the eight genes evaluated, the
RT-PCR results confirmed gene expression changes that were observed by
microarray.

Results and Discussion
Effect of BRB on esophageal histopathology. We previously
reported that the cellular morphology of esophagi from rats treated
with 5 Amol dietary PEITC alone or PEITC+NMBA was not significantly different from that of animals on control diet. In contrast,
the esophagi of rats treated with NMBA only exhibited significant
hyperplasia and low-grade dysplasia with evident cytotoxicity and
marked infiltration of inflammatory cells. Essentially identical
results were observed in the esophagi of rats treated with BRB
and BRB+NMBA [i.e., the esophagi from both the BRB alone and
BRB+NMBA animals were indistinguishable (P < 0.05) from the
controls; Fig. 1].

NMBA-dysregulated genes affected by BRB. In our companion
report (13), we noted that the expression of 2,261 genes was either
up-regulated or down-regulated more than z1.5-fold (P V 0.001) in
the esophagi of rats treated for 1 week with NMBA, and PEITC
modulated 1,323 of these genes to near-normal levels of expression.
In contrast, only 462 of the NMBA-affected genes were modulated
by BRB. Of these, 203 exhibited partially restored expression levels
and 259 were expressed at control levels (F33%; see Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table S1). Two hundred and fourteen of the 259
genes were up-regulated by NMBA and 45 were down-regulated.
We hypothesize that an important mechanism of chemoprevention
by BRB is the correction of NMBA-dysregulated genes to homeostatic levels of expression; thus, we have focused on understanding
the possible roles of the 259 genes returned to near-normal levels of
transcription by the BRB diet. Not all of these genes have known
functions, as denoted by the DAVID program; however, known
among them were those involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, chromosome partitioning, inflammation, differentiation, cell junctions, cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and
angiogenesis (Table 1). As in our companion report (13), we also
observed effects of BRB on the expression of genes involved in
carcinogen metabolism and DNA adduct formation. These and
other effects of BRB on gene expression in NMBA-treated rat
esophagus are described below, in brief.
NMBA-dysregulated DNA adduct formation genes normalized by BRB and PEITC. Exposure of rats to NMBA causes an
elevation in O 6-methylguanine adducts in esophageal DNA (3, 11).
Formation of O 6-methylguanine adducts is considered to be an
important early event in NMBA-induced esophageal carcinogenesis
because these adducts produce GC!AT transition mutations in
the second base of codon 12 of the Hras1 oncogene, a gene that
is activated early in esophageal tumorigenesis (18). Both BRB
and PEITC have been shown to reduce O 6-methylguanine adduct
levels in the esophagi of NMBA-treated rats (11, 19). In our companion report (13), we noted that the phase I enzymes, CYP2a2 and
CYP3a13, were overexpressed in NMBA-treated rat esophagus,
whereas their expression was normal in the esophagus of
NMBA+PEITC rats. In the present study, CYP2a2 expression was
also found to be near normal in BRB+NMBA–treated rat esophagus; however, CYP3a13 remained up-regulated. Thus, our data
suggest that CYP2a2 may be important in the bioactivation of
NMBA in rat esophagus and that down-regulation of CYP2a2 by
both BRB and PEITC may be responsible for the observed ability of
these chemopreventives to inhibit O 6-methylguanine adduct
formation in NMBA-treated esophagus.
Phase II enzymes lower the level of DNA adducts because they
inactivate carcinogens (and/or their metabolites) by conjugating
them to acceptor molecules (e.g., glutathione, glucuronic acid, and
sulfates; ref. 6). The specifics of phase II enzymes involved in rat
esophageal metabolism of NMBA have not been fully elucidated,
although the formation of glucuronide conjugates has been
reported (20). As we previously reported (13), PEITC corrected
the NMBA-reduced expression levels of some glutathione Stransferases (i.e., Gsta1, Gsta2, and Gstt2). In contrast, expression
of these genes remained low in the esophagi of BRB+NMBA rats,
suggesting that overexpression of these phase II enzymes may not
be sentinel for the inactivation of NMBA in rat esophagus. In
keeping with this interpretation is the finding that BRB also
antagonized NMBA-induced up-regulation of Taldo1, a key transaldolase in the pentose phosphate pathway that provides the
NADPH needed for reducing glutathione (21).

NMBA-dysregulated inflammation genes normalized by
BRB. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is overexpressed in
many human cancers, including ESCC (22). We have reported
that this radical generating enzyme is elevated in the esophagi of
rats 15 and 25 weeks after NMBA treatment, whereas companion
rats that also received the BRB diet had normal levels of this
enzyme (23). In contrast, iNOS was not elevated in the esophagi of
rats in the present study. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and
enzyme activity are also up-regulated in human ESCC (24), with
a corresponding increased level of prostaglandin E2 and associated
inflammatory processes. We have found that COX-2 was overexpressed in dysplastic lesions 15 and 25 weeks after NMBA treatment (23), but the expression level of COX-2 in the esophagi
recovered from corresponding NMBA-treated animals in the
present study was not elevated. Thus, iNOS and COX-2 dysregulation does not seem to be involved with the early phase of NMBAcaused esophageal carcinogenesis and the chemopreventive effects
of BRB regarding the regulation of these genes are seemingly
restricted to later stages of tumor development.
NMBA-dysregulated signal transduction genes normalized
by BRB. Among the DAVID clustering of the genes dysregulated
by NMBA, listed in Table 1, are 37 genes involved in signal
transduction. Of interest is the observation that several of these
genes are associated with ras activity. Among these are Map2k3
and Apc1, whose dysregulation affects Hras1 activity. As noted
above, f100% of rat esophageal tumors induced by NMBA have a
GC!AT transition mutation in the second base of codon 12 of the
Hras1 gene (18). Map2k3 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) kinase family member that is activated by stress to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

phosphorylate MAPK14/p38-MAPK, and elevated expression of the
Hras1 oncogene results in the accumulation of the active form of
MAPK14/p38-MAPK in breast cancer cells (25). Apc1, which is
transcribed at increased levels in breast and colon cancers, has
transforming capability, possibly through tyrosine dephosphorylation of the EphA2 receptor (26). Apc1 also interacts with several
other receptor tyrosine kinases and docking proteins, including
platelet-derived growth factor receptor and h-catenin. It is
considered to be a negative regulator of growth factor–induced
cell proliferation, but in Hras1-transformed cells, its overexpression
increases cell proliferation (27). Thus, reducing NMBA up-regulated
transcription of Map2k3 and Apc1 by BRB would antagonize
the pro-oncogenic activities of activated Hras1. Other ras-related
NMBA-dysregulated genes are Rab1 and H2A histone family
member Z (H2afz). Rab1 is a member of the Ras oncogene superfamily and is up-regulated in tongue SCC (28). H2afz is interesting
because it is an adaptor protein that interacts preferentially with
the active form of Hras1 and augments cell growth. Thus, several
genes associated with the ras signal transduction pathway were
returned to homeostasis by the BRB diet.
NMBA-dysregulated differentiation and morphogenesis
genes normalized by BRB. Eighteen transcripts were classified
as cellular differentiation and morphogenesis genes (Table 1). Two
notable ones were Grem1 and the 14-3-3 family chaperone protein
Ywhah. Grem1, which interacts with the Ywhah protein, encodes a
secreted antagonist of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway,
which in turn plays a crucial role in regulating the balance between
expansion and cell differentiation (29). In addition to its interaction
with Grem1, Ywhah mediates signal transduction via activation of

protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II. Loss of the chaperone activity of Ywhah may also play
a role in oxidative signaling underlying oxidative damage (29).
Another interesting transcript is sciellin, which encodes a precursor
to the cornified envelope of terminally differentiated cells (30). Its
down-regulation by NMBA could disrupt the normal differentiation program of esophageal squamous cells and promote cell
transformation. Thus, the observations that BRB restore
near-normal expression of Grem1, Ywhah, and sciellin could be
mechanisms by which the berries impede esophageal cell transformation.
NMBA-dysregulated cell junction, adhesion, or motility
genes normalized by BRB. Twenty transcripts were classified by
the DAVID program as cell junction, adhesion, or motility genes
(Table 1). Among these is CD44 antigen, which encodes a cell
surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion,
and migration. The v6 alternate transcript of CD44 is up-regulated
in human ESCC (31). Another is Actn4, which encodes a nonmuscle
actinin and is localized to moving structures and is significantly
elevated in cells exhibiting enhanced motility. The level of this
protein progressively increases from early- to late-stage ESSC (32).
Another NMBA-caused overexpression normalized by BRB was
moesin. Elevated moesin has been associated with oral squamous
cell carcinomas (33). The protein is a membrane-cytoskeleton
linker in microvilli, ruffles, and cleavage furrows and thus plays a
key role in cell morphology, adhesion, and motility. Lastly, the
up-regulation of Cdc42 by NMBA was also normalized by BRB.
Thus, another possible chemopreventive mechanism of BRB may

be to interfere with the formation of the Cdc42/Rac1 complex (34),
which promotes cell migration. Overall, the data support the
conclusion that an important mechanism of BRB chemoprevention
is correcting expression of NMBA-dysregulated cell junction,
adhesion, and motility genes.
NMBA-dysregulated apoptosis/cell death genes normalized
by BRB. Previous studies have shown that the BRB diet increased
the level of apoptosis/cell death in tumors and tumor cell lines (4).
The DAVID program analysis identified 14 genes (Table 1) that
were expressed at normal levels in the NMBA+BRB rats compared
with the NMBA animals. One is Hmox1; its increased expression is
associated with resistance to induction of apoptosis by oxidative
stress caused by a wide range of chemical injuries (35). Another is
Mcl1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, which was regulated to nearnormal levels by the BRB diet. Mcl1 protects mitochondrial integrity though suppression of cytochrome c release (36). Therefore,
correction of Mcl1 transcription by BRB should augment apoptotic
activity in NMBA-initiated cells. Expression of the gene Pip5k1a
(predicted) was also corrected by the BRB diet. Overexpression of
this gene can rescue cells from stress-induced apoptosis mediated
by the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2
signaling (37). Thus, appropriate regulation of apoptosis seems to
be a mechanism of BRB chemoprevention.
NMBA-dysregulated angiogenesis genes normalized by BRB.
The BRB diet also normalized the expression of several genes the
DAVID program clustered with angiogenesis activities that were
dysregulated by NMBA (Table 1). Among these was Klf5, which
was down-regulated by NMBA. It is a Kruppel-like zinc finger

transcription factor that modulates cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Klf5 seems to be a
tumor suppressor for breast cancer (38). Thus, one mechanism of
BRB may be to restore expression of this tumor suppressor factor.
Fgfbp1 was up-regulated by NMBA; it is a secreted protein thought
to enhance fibroblast growth factor activity and drive tumor
angiogenesis. Fgfbp1 is up-regulated early during wound healing of
mouse and human skin as well as during the initiation of skin
neoplasia by chemical carcinogens (39). Thus, its normalization by
BRB should depress angiogenesis. Interestingly, previous studies
have shown that a 5% BRB diet down-regulates the expression
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-1 (VEGF-1) in the esophagus of rats when given for several weeks after treatment of rats
with NMBA (40). VEGF-1 was not overly expressed in the present
study, indicating that this gene, along with iNOS and COX-2, does
not seem to be involved in the early stages of tumor initiation in
the rat esophagus.
Genes dysregulated by NMBA and normalized by PEITC or
BRB. Another purpose of our study was to identify gene expression
changes in NMBA-treated rat esophagus that were returned to
homeostasis by both PEITC and BRB. We identified 53 genes
modulated by both treatments (Table 2). These genes are of special
interest because they may be sentinel genes of NMBA-induced
carcinogenesis and, as such, primary targets for chemoprevention.
One of the most interesting among these genes is Pls3. Its
overexpression increases cell proliferation and invasion of tumor
cells, probably due to suppression of E-cadherin. Expression of this
gene is increased in the lung tissue of mice treated with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

carcinogens, and its dysregulation is corrected by a diet containing
indole-3-carbinol (41). Thus, Pls3 overexpression is antagonized by
three different forms of chemopreventive diets (i.e., BRB, PEITC,
and indole-3-carbinol) in both esophagus and lung rodent cancer
models.
Other up-regulated genes that have been associated with cancer
are Bub1, Crk, Map2k3, Psck9, PVR, Rab1, PDCD10, H2afz, and
Cyp2a2. Map2k3, PVR, Rab1, H2afz, and Cyp2a2 are discussed
above. Mutations in spindle checkpoint function kinase gene
Bub1 have been associated with aneuploidy (42). The oncogene Crk
is increased in several human cancers and its overexpression in
cultured epithelial cells causes them to exhibit an altered morphology, to proliferate in soft agar, and to grow as massive tumors in
nude mice (43). Psck9 is a Ca2+-dependent apoptosis-regulated
convertase that stimulates tumor cell proliferation, motility, and
invasiveness (44). PDCD10 encodes a protein with similarity to
proteins that participate in apoptosis. It interacts with MST4
kinase to promote cell proliferation via modulation of the ERK
pathway when overexpressed (45). Thus, returning all of these
genes to near-normal levels of expression might be mechanisms by
which PEITC and BRB impede esophageal cell transformation.
Also among the 53 genes are some that were not associated
with a DAVID-identified cancer ontology. On closer review of the
literature, however, they are of interest because they have activities
that, if dysregulated, could have carcinogenic effects. Several of
these genes were up-regulated by NMBA. Among these is Adamts6_
predicted , a member of a family of 20 genes involved in tissue
organization during embryogenesis and angiogenesis. Some of the

proteins encoded by members of this family have matrix-degrading
activity and may be involved in cell invasion (46). The gene Ddx5 is
a transcriptional coactivator and/or corepressor, depending on the
context of the promoter and the transcriptional complex in which
it associates (47). Thus, its dysregulation may cause inappropriate

expression of genes with oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities.
The transcript NS5A (hepatitis C virus) transactivated protein 9
(Ns5atp9) is the rat homologue of human KIAA0101 whose function
is unknown. However, it binds with proliferating cell nuclear
antigen and is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (48).

Cancer Research

Transfection of this gene enhanced cancer cell growth and
transformed NIH3T3 cells, whereas its inhibition caused attenuation of proliferation.
Both BRB and PEITC diets normalized the expression of seven
genes that were down-regulated by NMBA. Of special note is
Rbbp6, which encodes a 250-kDa ring finger-containing protein
that is frequently up-regulated in human ESCC. This protein binds
to underphosphorylated but not phosphorylated retinoblastoma
protein (Rb). The phosphorylated Rb gene product binds the
nuclear transcription factor E2F and prevents its ability to function
in the S phase of the cell cycle (49). Thus, Rbbp6 competes with E2F
for binding to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and high
concentrations of the protein, as are found in human ESCC cells,
would free E2F to stimulate cell proliferation. Rbbp6 also binds to
p53, thereby enhancing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and
degradation of p53, leading to decreased apoptosis. Consequently,
down-regulation of Rbbp6 by BRB or PEITC should slow cell
growth and increase the rate of apoptosis.
Another NMBA-dysregulated gene restored to normal levels of
expression by BRB and PEITC was homologue of zebra fish ES1
(RGD1303003), which is the rat homologue of human C21orf33.
This gene is required for the growth-inhibitory effect of all-trans
retinoic acid on MCF-7 breast cancer cells (50). Its down-regulation
by NMBA suggests a mechanism whereby the carcinogen promotes
cancer by repressing terminal differentiation pathways. Mss4
protein (Mss4) binds to the membrane proximal conserved region
of a-integrin chains and regulates the activation of inactive pro–
matrix metalloproteins. The active forms of metalloproteins are
important in tumor invasion and metastasis (51). Thus, it will be
interesting to determine if and how down-regulation of Mss4 by
NMBA contributes to esophageal carcinogenesis.

In summary, in this and our companion report (13), we have
found that a short exposure of the rat esophagus to NMBA causes
dysregulation of 2,261 transcripts that affect a multitude of cellular
functions. Diets containing 5 Amol PEITC or 5% BRB restored
1,323 or 462 of these 2,261 transcripts to near-normal levels of
expression, respectively. Thus, as might be expected, there is a
direct correlation between the number of transcripts modulated to
near-normal levels of expression and the inhibitory potential of
PEITC and BRB in this model because PEITC is a more potent
inhibitor of NMBA-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis than
BRB (3). In the present study, we discuss 53 transcripts that are
dysregulated by NMBA and restored to homeostatic levels of
expression by both BRB and PEITC. We speculate that these 53
genes are sentinel early changes in the process of NMBA-induced
tumorigenesis in the rat esophagus, and future investigations will
focus on elucidating their mechanistic roles.
