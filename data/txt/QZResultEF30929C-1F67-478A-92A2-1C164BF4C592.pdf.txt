Abstract
Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is observed in the majority of small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
cases and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. While targeting Bcl-2 in hematologic malignancies
continues to show signs of promise, translating the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (or ABT-263; navitoclax) to the clinic for
solid tumors has remained problematic, with limited single-agent activity in early-phase clinical trials. Here, we
used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC to study ABT-737 resistance and demonstrated that
responses to ABT-737 are short lived and coincide with decreases in HIF-1a–regulated transcripts. Combining the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin with ABT-737 rescued this resistance mechanism, was highly synergistic in vitro, and
provided durable tumor regressions in vivo without notable hematologic suppression. In comparison, tumor
regressions did not occur when ABT-737 was combined with etoposide, a gold-standard cytotoxic for SCLC
therapy. Rapamycin exposure was consistently associated with an increase in the proapoptotic protein BAX,
whereas ABT-737 caused dose-dependent decreases in BAX. As ABT-737 triggers programmed cell death in a
BAX/BAK-dependent manner, we provide preclinical evidence that the efﬁcacy of ABT-737 as a single agent is selflimiting in SCLC, but the addition of rapamycin can maintain or increase levels of BAX protein and markedly
enhance the anticancer efﬁcacy of ABT-737. These data have direct translational implications for SCLC clinical
trials. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2846–56. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 12% to 15% of all
lung cancers and accounts for nearly 30,000 deaths in the
United States annually (1). Etoposide plus cisplatin was established as the standard of care for SCLC in the 1980s and can
confer high response rates (>60%) as initial therapy (2). However, therapy-refractory recurrence is nearly universal and, as a
consequence, SCLC has one of the highest case fatality rates
among cancer—a statistic that has not changed signiﬁcantly
over the past 30 years (3). Since 2003, only one agent, topotecan,
has received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for SCLC. New therapies are in critical need.
One targetable opportunity is in the overexpression of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Between 60% to 90% of SCLC cases

have been reported to express high Bcl-2 protein (4, 5) and this
is thought to be a mechanism by which SCLC resists programmed cell death. Through structure-guided medicinal
chemistry efforts, the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 emerged as the
prototypic small-molecule candidate to exploit overexpression
of Bcl-2 in cancer (6). ABT-737 most closely simulates the
proapoptotic protein Bad from a functional standpoint and
serves as a competitive BH3 mimetic with high afﬁnity to the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Thus, when
targeting Bcl-2 was possible with ABT-737 and the orally
bioavailable derivative ABT-263 (navitoclax), efforts were
made to translate preclinical ﬁndings in SCLC to patients
(7, 8).
However, early-phase clinical trials investigating ABT-263 as
a single agent in SCLC failed to show the dramatic responses
that were observed in preclinical SCLC cell line xenograft
models (7, 9, 10). In clinical studies of ABT-263, the inhibition
of Bcl-xL in platelet populations yielded dose-dependent
thrombocytopenia and has somewhat limited the utility of
this high-afﬁnity Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor. It is becoming increasingly evident that targeting certain Bcl-2 family members in a
tumor must be considered in the context of other lineagespeciﬁc dependencies to minimize toxicities (11). Moreover,
although lead-in dosing strategies with ABT-263 could lessen
the observed thrombocytopenia, inhibiting both Bcl-2 and BclxL with concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy has added complexity to maximizing therapeutic combinations with ABT-263.
Strategies to model resistance to ABT-737/263 in SCLC and
other tumor types have identiﬁed the antiapoptotic protein

Rapamycin Rescues ABT-737 Efﬁcacy in SCLC

MCL-1 as a major culprit, in which MCL-1 can serve a functionally redundant role in sequestering the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK and is not targeted by ABT-737. Efforts to
increase the sensitivity of various cancers to ABT-737 have
focused on mechanisms that affect MCL-1, either through
direct targeting or exploiting the relatively short half-life of
the MCL-1 protein (12, 13). Many compounds shown to synergize with ABT-737 in SCLC and other cancers are global
transcriptional or translational repressors, such as anthracyclines (14, 15); however, combining these agents in the clinic
could prove challenging due to toxicity. Although other antiapoptotic proteins not targeted by ABT-737 have been implicated in resistance to ABT-737, the major antiapoptotic players
observed to be ampliﬁed across many cancer types are Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and MCL-1 (16). How these antiapoptotic regulators
govern the activity of proapoptotic BAX and BAK with other
apoptotic effectors in the context of a given tumor help to
deﬁne a cancer hallmark—resistance to programmed cell
death (17).
We previously reported that ABT-737 could induce dramatic
responses in SCLC cell lines, in agreement with what others
have shown; however, ABT-737 alone failed to produce substantial tumor responses in SCLC patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) models that express low levels of Bcl-2 (18). Here, we
show that Bcl-2–expressing SCLC PDXs initially respond to
ABT-737, but the responses are not durable and the addition of
etoposide does not improve responses. We used these PDX
models to investigate the transcriptional changes that occur
during initial responses to ABT-737 to develop strategies to
increase the efﬁcacy of ABT-737. We found that the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin could enhance the antitumor activity of
ABT-737 in vitro and in vivo, rescuing the self-limiting effects of
single-agent ABT-737. We further observed that this combinatorial activity correlated with an increase in proapoptotic
BAX.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
SCLC cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and maintained as recommended. All cell lines
tested negative for mycoplasma (Lonza; MycoAlert) and were
short tandem repeat veriﬁed at the Johns Hopkins Fragment
Analysis Facility within 6 months of use. ABT-737 was obtained
from Abbott Laboratories (now Abbvie) and purchased from
Active Biochem (A-1002). For in vivo use, ABT-737 and etoposide (Accord Healthcare, Inc.) were prepared as previously
described (18). Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was stored in
100% ethanol at 50 mg/mL. For in vivo use, rapamycin vehicle
was 82% PBS/5% Tween-80/5% polyethylene glycol 400/8%
ethanol. AZD8055 (S1555), BEZ235 (S1009), everolimus
(S1120), LY294002 (S1105), and wortmannin (S2758) were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was used as a vehicle for all in vitro experiments.
Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cells were plated 24 hours before treatments in 96-well
plates at 1,000 to 5,000 cells per well. Proliferation (CellTiter

www.aacrjournals.org

96 AQueous One; Promega) and viability (CellTiter-Glo; Promega) assays were quantiﬁed on a compatible plate reader
(SpectraMax M2e; Molecular Devices). All combination and
drug synergy experiments were performed for 72 hours before
assaying.
Assessment of drug synergy
Drug synergy was determined quantitatively using the combination index (CI) method of Chou and Talalay (19). Viability
was calculated across a wide range of doses for both ABT-737
and each compound of interest using a nonconstant ratio. CI
was calculated as a function of response or fraction affected
(Fa) using the formula [CI ¼ (D1)/(Dx)1 þ (D2)/(Dx)2], in which
D1 and D2 are the doses used to achieve a speciﬁc response in
combination and (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are individual drug doses
needed to achieve similar response. A CI >1 indicates antagonism, whereas a CI <1 indicates synergism.
Pimonidazole staining and immunohistochemistry
Mice were injected with Hypoxyprobe-1 solution (Hypoxyprobe, Inc.) approximately 1 hour before sacriﬁce. Tumors were
ﬁxed in formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned at 5-mm
thickness. Sections were dewaxed and incubated in citrate,
pH 6.0 (Vector Laboratories; H-3300) for 25 minutes. Sections
were stained using the Dako EnVision Plus Detection System
with rabbit PAb2627 (Hypoxyprobe; HP3-100Kit) for 45 minutes at 25 C and were visualized with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
reagent (Sigma; D423). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
was performed with an automated slide stainer (Leica) with
Modiﬁed Harris Hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientiﬁc).
Isolation of heavy membranes
Separation of crude mitochondria ("heavy membranes")
from cytosol in cell lines and tumor tissue was performed
using a QProteome Mitochondrial Isolation Kit (Qiagen).
Samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes on ice before clariﬁcation at
13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. Protein concentrations were
determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (microBCA;
Pierce). A list of antibodies used for Western blots is provided
in Supplementary Methods.
SCLC PDX models and dosing
All in vivo experiments were performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD). The LX33 and
LX48 PDXs were isolated and passaged as previously described
(18, 20, 21). LX47 PDXs were passaged as tumor tissue sections
(2–3 mm) coated in Matrigel and implanted via subcutaneous
ﬂap incisions. All treatment experiments were performed in
female C.B-17 severe combined immunodeﬁcient (scid) mice,
4 to 6 weeks old at time of PDX injection/implantation (Taconic; C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid). The LX33 and LX47 PDXs were
derived from chemotherapy-na€ve patients with SCLC and the
LX48 PDX from a patient previously treated with platinum plus
etoposide. Tumor volumes were calculated from manual caliper
measurements with an ellipsoid formula in which volume

(mm3) ¼ (xy2)/2. Once tumor volumes reached approximately
150 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment arms and treated
daily via intraperitoneal injections with vehicles, ABT-737
(100 mg/kg), rapamycin (20 mg/kg), etoposide (12 mg/kg on
days 1, 4, and 9), or combinations of two agents.
RNA isolation and genome-wide transcriptional proﬁling
Total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
with on-column DNase I digestion. RNA quality was assessed
with a Nanodrop-1000 for OD260/280 and OD260/230 ratios and
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Total RNA (500 ng) from each
sample was ampliﬁed and labeled using an Illumina TotalPrep
RNA ampliﬁcation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Ambion). Biotinylated RNA (750 ng) was combined with hybridization buffer and hybridized to HumanHT-12 v4 Expression
BeadChip arrays (Illumina) for 16 to 20 hours at 58 C. Arrays were
washed at 55 C and blocked at 25 C. Bound biotinylated RNA
was stained with streptavidin-Cy3 and washed. Dried arrays were
protected from light until scanning with an iScan System. Data
were extracted using the Gene Expression Module in GenomeStudio Software. Gene expression data are deposited into Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession IDs pending.
Gene expression analysis
Using the Bioconductor suite for R (22) and the limma
package (23), raw gene expression data were quantile normalized, then log2 transformed. Differentially expressed genes
were identiﬁed by ﬁtting a linear model for each feature. SEs
of log2 transformed changes were moderated using an empirical Bayesian approach. For each feature, moderated t statistics, B statistics, raw, and adjusted P values (corrected for
multiple testing by the Benjamini and Hochberg method) were
calculated. Permutation-based gene set enrichment was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a sample
permutation-based method, and CAMERA, a competitive gene
set testing method that accounts for intergene correlation (24,
25). The gene set database used was MSigDB 3.1 from the Broad
Institute (Cambridge, MA; ref. 26).
Hematology
Whole blood was collected immediately following cervical
dislocation in C.B-17 scid mice via cardiac puncture using
tuberculin syringes ﬂushed with 1 mol/L EDTA, immediately
transferred to K2EDTA lavender tubes (BD Microtainer), and
stored at 4 C for less than 24 hours before analysis. Complete
blood count with differential parameters was measured on a
Hemavet 950FS (Drew Scientiﬁc) at the Johns Hopkins Phenotyping Core.
Statistical analysis of drug efﬁcacy experiments
All animal data are reported as average tumor volumes  SD.
Tumor volume comparisons between treatment groups used
data from weekly time points using a two-sided Student t test;
throughout the text unless indicated:  , P < 0.01 and  , P <
0.001. All graphs in ﬁgures were created using GraphPad Prism
6.0c (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Figures for drug combination
matrix outputs and drug synergy were created in R, as previously reported (27).

Results
Treatment with ABT-737 results in short-lived tumor
responses and is associated with a decrease in HIF-1a
transcripts
We previously reported that ABT-737 had limited activity
alone and in combination with etoposide in SCLC PDXs that
express low levels of Bcl-2 (18). To further assess the activity of
ABT-737 in a more representative set of PDXs, we extended
these studies to include three Bcl-2–expressing SCLC PDX
models—LX44, LX47, and LX48—as well as a SCLC PDX model
that does not express appreciable Bcl-2 for historic control
(LX33). Treatment with ABT-737 resulted in modest antitumor
activity with statistically signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition
(TGI) in LX47 and LX48, but minimal effects in LX44 and LX33
over a period of 3 weeks where ABT-737 was administered daily
(Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, all PDX models express other
antiapoptotic targets of ABT-737, as well as MCL-1. Treatment
with ABT-737 was more effective than etoposide, a standard of
care therapeutic agent for SCLC (Fig. 1C). The addition of
etoposide to ABT-737 did not improve responses in PDXs
derived from chemotherapy-na€ve (LX47) or recurrent (LX48)
tumors and was poorly tolerated by mice as evidenced by
weight loss while on treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B). Notably, we observed that responses to ABT-737 in these
PDXs were short-lived; minimal regressions during continuous
treatment progressed at growth rates comparable with vehicletreated tumors after treatment discontinuation.
To investigate potential acute resistance mechanisms to
ABT-737, we selected LX47 and LX48 for further characterization of responses. We hypothesized that during tumor
response, a sensitivity signature may exist and precede tumor
outgrowth in such models. Using whole-genome transcriptional proﬁling, we compared the gene expression proﬁles of
tumors from vehicle- and ABT-737–treated mice collected at
points of maximal response (Supplementary Table S1). Transcriptional proﬁling results comparing ABT-737–treated with
vehicle-treated tumors revealed that some of the most differentially expressed genes were well-established HIF-1a transcriptional targets, such as LDHA and BNIP3L (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Table S2). GSEA revealed that HIF-1a gene sets
comprised the majority of the most statistically signiﬁcant
gene sets downregulated in ABT-737–treated tumors (Supplementary Table S3). To further illustrate the changes observed
in HIF-1a transcripts, we plotted the log ratio of treatment
groups (M) by the average intensity (A) for each probe in order
to visualize how genome-wide transcriptional proﬁling data
from the ABT-737–treated PDX models compared with a
benchmark HIF-1a–regulated gene set (28). Many transcripts
that are normally upregulated by hypoxia (Fig. 1D, bottom;
green) were decreased upon ABT-737 treatment, whereas
transcripts downregulated by hypoxia (Fig. 1D, bottom;
magenta) were unchanged. There are data supporting that
ABT-737 is more effective under hypoxic conditions in vitro as
well as in vivo and that hypoxia is a negative regulator of MCL-1
half-life (29, 30). We did not observe changes in MCL-1 transcript or protein levels during acute treatments with ABT-737
in LX47 or LX48. Although transcriptional proﬁling data

suggested that ABT-737–treated tumors lack expression of

regions of physiologic hypoxia at time points within the

A rapamycin signature is predicted to connect with ABT737 response and shows synergy with ABT-737 in vitro
To identify agents or pathways that are associated with
responses to ABT-737 in Bcl-2–expressing PDX models, we
queried the Broad Institute's publicly available Connectivity
Map database (cMap build 2.0) using the most signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed genes between control- and ABT737–treated tumors (Supplementary Table S2). The cMap
database attempts to connect gene expression data to

changes that result from exposures to bioactive compounds
in vitro (31). This approach is advantageous in the setting of
data from whole-genome proﬁling experiments in which the
contributions of individual transcripts may not hold clear
signiﬁcance to an overarching pathway or group of pathways
being affected, and thus it provides more generalizable
strategies to affect an observed proﬁle. Several of the highest
scoring bioactive compounds identiﬁed by our cMap query
to align with an ABT-737 response were inhibitors of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway (Supplementary Table S4)—pathways known to regulate and interact with HIF-1a (32).
Taken together with literature supporting the combined
effect of PI3K/mTOR and Bcl-2 inhibition in other tumor types
(33–36) and the mounting evidence for rationally cotargeting
growth and survival pathways, we tested the combination of

To demonstrate whether the combined effect of rapamycin
and ABT-737 was synergistic, we focused on two cell lines that
differed in their expression of Bcl-2 (NCI-H146 and NCI-H82)
and treated cells with ABT-737 and drugs targeting PI3K
(wortmannin; LY294002), mTOR (rapamycin; everolimus;
AZD8055), or both (BEZ235), selected based on our cMap
results (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). Using broad dose
combinations, we quantitatively calculated synergy for each
drug combination across a range of doses using the method of
Chou and Talalay and a nonconstant ratio approach (19).
Representative dose-matrix outputs for the combination of
ABT-737 and rapamycin in NCI-H82 and NCI-H146 are shown
in Fig. 2C. The agents studied had varying potency that was
generally segregated by inhibitor class (Fig. 2D). Synergism in
NCI-H146 is summarized in Fig. 2E by plotting the CI as a
function of Fa (37). For example, wortmannin showed no
synergy at any dose, whereas all other compounds showed
quantitative synergism. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin
and everolimus displayed strong synergism over a wide

high levels of Bcl-2 (NCI-H146 and NCI-H187) and two lines
that do not express appreciable Bcl-2 (NCI-H82 and NCI-H446;
ref. 6). As expected, treatment with ABT-737 resulted in dosedependent decreases in viability in lines that express Bcl-2
with little effect on lines that do not express Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A).
Bcl-2–expressing lines were also more sensitive than non–Bcl2-expressing lines to rapamycin. This effect was not dosedependent after 72 hours of exposure in the dose ranges
studied (low nanomolar to micromolar) and we conﬁrmed
this trend in a larger set of SCLC cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Combining increasing doses of ABT-737 with 100 nmol/L
rapamycin had minimal effect on low expressing Bcl-2 lines,
but was at least additive in Bcl-2–expressing lines. However,
treating ABT-737–sensitive cell lines with 100 nmol/L rapamycin for 24 or 72 hours before exposure to ABT-737 did not
dramatically alter the sensitivity of these lines to ABT-737 (Fig.
2B), suggesting that rapamycin does not acutely sensitize cell
lines to ABT-737.

Rapamycin Rescues ABT-737 Efﬁcacy in SCLC

combination of ABT-737 and rapamycin caused tumor regressions. Importantly, these responses were sustained well
beyond the 14-day treatment period, with no detectable tumor
masses in LX47 PDXs for several weeks after combination
treatment was discontinued, though tumors eventually
returned (data not shown). Consistent with our previous
report, treatment of LX33 PDXs with ABT-737 did not affect
tumor growth. Treatment of LX33 with rapamycin resulted in
TGI and the addition of ABT-737 to rapamycin caused a
modest increase in TGI over rapamycin alone (Fig. 3C).
Although this combined effect lost statistical signiﬁcance
after 1 week of treatment, these data suggest there was some
degree of combinatorial activity in the absence of high Bcl-2
expression.
Mice tolerated the combination well, with no apparent
weight loss across all 3 PDX models (Supplementary Fig. S3B).

rapamycin in combination with ABT-737 in vivo.
Rapamycin has combinatorial activity with ABT-737 in
multiple SCLC PDX models
We next assessed the combination of ABT-737 and rapamycin in the same PDXs in which we observed acute resistance
to ABT-737—LX47 and LX48—as well as in a SCLC PDX that
does not express appreciable Bcl-2 protein (LX33) that we
previously reported had little response to ABT-737 (18). All
PDX models examined express PI3K/mTOR pathway components and exhibit pathway activation as demonstrated by basal
levels of phospho-Akt (S473), phospho-4E-BP1 (T37/46), and
phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (S235/6; Supplementary Fig.
S3A). In both Bcl-2–expressing PDXs, treatment with either
ABT-737 or rapamycin caused signiﬁcant TGI and the

early (after 3 days) and later (after 7 days) time points.
Because this combination seemed to be well tolerated, we
tested whether we could obtain similar tumor regressions in
LX47 PDXs previously exposed to either ABT-737 or rapamycin. We observed tumor volume reductions of approximately
50% with 2 weeks of ABT-737 and rapamycin treatment that
were sustained after treatment discontinuation, adding
strength to the potential utility of this combination (Fig. 3F).

As both ABT-737 (38, 39) and rapamycin (40) are known to
affect platelets, we assessed hematologic measures in mice
bearing LX47 after 7 days of treatment. Platelet counts in ABT737–treated mice were signiﬁcantly lower than those of
vehicle-treated mice as expected; however, hematologic parameters from combination-treated mice were similar to vehicle
and rapamycin alone (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. S3C).
All animals that received rapamycin were slightly anemic.
Histologically, tumors from mice treated with ABT-737 or
combination exhibited greater necrosis than did vehicle- or
rapamycin-treated tumors as evidenced by H&E sections
showing increased eosinophilic regions throughout the tumor
core (Fig. 3E; ABT-737 H&E section). Pimonidazole staining of
tumors from each treatment arm showed consistent, detectable hypoxic regions in all samples except tumors treated
with combinatorial therapy. This striking difference was
observed in multiple tumors treated with combination at

with ABT-737 on HIF-1a targets, we compared protein and
message expression in LX47 and LX33 PDXs after 7 days of

levels of HIF-1a protein and several HIF-1a targets such as

Rapamycin Rescues ABT-737 Efﬁcacy in SCLC

vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4A). Treatment with rapamycin
increased the protein levels of most targets examined; however, these changes were less evident in LX47. In LX47, but not
LX33, combination treatment resulted in signiﬁcant decreases
in HIF-1a, HIF-1b, LDHA, and CXCR4 levels. One reason for
these observations may relate to differences in tumor response:
combination-treated LX47 tumors lose >70% of their starting
volume by day 7, which may complicate analysis of protein
samples.
Correlating these ﬁndings with transcriptional proﬁling
data, we observed decreased levels of six HIF-1a–regulated
genes in LX47 after treatment with ABT-737 (Fig. 4B); this effect
was less pronounced in LX33, but nonetheless, observed for
most genes. Interestingly, rapamycin increased transcript
levels of nearly all highlighted genes. In the combination arm,
levels of nearly all transcripts were less than vehicle controls,
and in some cases (i.e., VEGF-A in LX33) lower than ABT-737–
treated groups.
Although this paired analysis of changes highlighted several
similarities in the few targets examined, we sought to better
understand whether there was a more general transcriptional
response to ABT-737. This led us to examine the overall
concordance between gene expression changes observed in
LX33 and LX47 in response to ABT-737, as treatment inﬂuenced protein and transcript levels in these SCLC PDXs
independent of Bcl-2 expression. We generated a concordance
at the top (CAT) plot to compare drug treatment effects in each
model (41). This plot relates the concordance between the top
differentially expressed gene lists of n length for each model
compared with what would be expected by chance. The ABT737 treatment signature was more concordant than rapamycin
alone, combination treatment, or what would be expected by
chance (Fig. 4C). These results were surprising, as we anticipated that there would have been a more pronounced concordance between models treated with rapamycin than ABT737, as the effects on HIF-1a–regulated genes were similar in
the rapamycin-treated groups as compared with the ABT-737–
treated groups. One potential explanation could be that this
ranked approach does not account for the magnitude of gene
expression differences, nor does it weigh P values for each
comparison.
The differences observed prompted further investigation
into how the mTOR pathway was affected in these two
models. In LX33, treatment with ABT-737 decreased protein
levels of several mTOR components, including near complete loss of GbL by Western blot (Fig. 4D). This may reﬂect
the extent to which the mTOR pathway is inﬂuenced by HIF1a in this PDX model, as we observed a similar loss of HIF1a and HIF-1b/ARNT in LX33. In both PDXs, treatment
with rapamycin—alone or in combination with ABT-737—
decreased levels of phospho-Akt (S473) versus the vehicle
controls; this effect was most pronounced for the combination treatment in LX33. Although we observed mTOR inhibition at the level of Akt, the levels of phospho-ribosomal
protein S6 differed between rapamycin-treated groups, but
were similar between combination treatment groups. This
difference may reﬂect the degree of Akt feedback that is
present when treating with rapamycin alone or in combi-

nation with ABT-737 (42). Indeed, levels of phospho-Akt
(T308) in LX47 treated with rapamycin seem to be elevated
as compared with vehicle, but not in the context of the
combination (Fig. 4D).
Rapamycin blocks ABT-737–induced decrease in BAX
protein levels in SCLC
In parallel, we looked at protein expression of candidate Bcl2 family members in LX33 and LX47 PDXs at day 7 by Western
blot. We did not observe consistent changes in protein levels of
previously reported determinants of ABT-737 sensitivity
(MCL-1 or proapoptotic proteins Puma and Noxa) that correlated with response in our PDXs models. However, we did
observe that the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK were
increased in both PDXs treated with rapamycin alone or in
combination with ABT-737 (Fig. 5A).
As ABT-737 is known to cause programmed cell death in a
BAX/BAK-dependent manner, and BAX is a key proapoptotic
binding partner of Bcl-2 (43), we assessed the effect of ABT-737
or rapamycin on BAX protein levels in vivo. For these analyses,
we selected LX33 that allowed for more control in size matching tumor volumes across treatment groups. We treated mice
bearing LX33 for 7 days with vehicle, escalating doses of ABT737 (5, 25, and 100 mg/kg), escalating doses of rapamycin (1, 5,
and 20 mg/kg), or the combination of the highest doses of each
agent. We observed a modest, but dose-dependent decrease in
BAX protein from tumors treated with ABT-737 and an overall
increase in BAX protein in tumors treated with rapamycin
(Fig. 5B). This change was also observed in heavy membranes isolated from tumors, enriching for mitochondria.
Although we had small numbers of mice per dose-escalation
group, we noted that all rapamycin doses caused TGI to a
similar degree, consistent with our in vitro data (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We also observed an increase in the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-w with increasing
doses of rapamycin (Fig. 5B). Levels of MCL-1 protein were
not signiﬁcantly decreased by rapamycin in vivo, where
MCL-1 levels were actually greater in combination-treated
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Furthermore, ABT-737
caused a dose-dependent decrease in HIF-1b/ARNT (Supplementary Fig. S4C). We also found that in SCLC cell lines,
exposure to rapamycin was associated with an increase in
the amount of BAX present in the heavy membrane fraction
of cells, most prominent in NCI-H146 (Fig. 5C). This increase
in BAX occurred without an apparent release of cytochrome
C into the cytosol, suggesting that an increase in membraneassociated BAX in these lines was not by itself associated
with greater programmed cell death, but that multiple
mechanisms may be at play for the combined effect of
rapamycin and ABT-737.

Discussion
Here, we report that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 has limited
single-agent efﬁcacy in Bcl-2–expressing SCLC PDXs, consistent with the modest clinical activity of ABT-263 observed in
patients with recurrent SCLC. Using PDX models as a platform
to study ABT-737 resistance, we found that acute treatment

with ABT-737 was associated with a decrease in many HIF-1a–
regulated transcripts. Rapamycin effectively blocked this
decrease and increased message and protein levels of many
of these genes. Combining rapamycin with ABT-737 was highly
synergistic in vitro and provided durable tumor regressions in
Bcl-2–expressing PDX models in vivo. We observed a decrease
in BAX protein levels upon exposure to ABT-737 that was
prevented by rapamycin. As BAX protein levels are regulated
by hypoxia through HIF-1a–dependent and independent
mechanisms (44), we were surprised to see changes in BAX
levels upon exposure to ABT-737 or rapamycin were not
associated with observable changes in physiologic hypoxia in
tumors as compared with controls. This may in part be due to
the basal levels of hypoxia in these SCLC PDX models, as
heterogeneity within a given PDX may complicate mechanistic
analysis.
Loss of BAX is a known mechanism of resistance to several
classes of anticancer agents (45, 46) and can promote tumor-

igenesis in certain models (47). In human cancers, loss of BAX
through mutation (48) or regulation of protein stability (49) is
associated with events promoting tumor development and
correlates with poor prognosis. Here, the observed changes in
BAX protein after rapamycin exposure align well with known
mechanisms by which ABT-737 induces apoptosis and with
studies of genetic determinants of ABT-737 lethality (6, 50). The
most straightforward interpretation of these data is that acute
treatment with ABT-737 is self-limiting in nature, possibly
through global decreases in critical HIF-1a–regulated transcripts and the proapoptotic protein BAX, both of which are
effectively rescued or restored upon the addition of rapamycin
(Fig. 5D). However, multiple mechanisms are likely involved,
warranting further investigation.
Of clinical relevance, the LX47 and LX48 PDXs were derived
from chemotherapy-na€ve and recurrent SCLC patient tumors,
respectively; thus, the combination of ABT-737 and rapamycin
was active independent of prior chemotherapy exposure and

Rapamycin Rescues ABT-737 Efﬁcacy in SCLC

sensitivity to etoposide in our models. The observations made
here have clear implications for clinical trials in patients with
SCLC. The efﬁcacy of single-agent ABT-737 or its orally bioavailable derivative ABT-263 is limited, both in PDX models
and in patients with SCLC. Previous efforts to combine
ABT-263 with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with SCLC
were stopped due to unacceptable levels of hematologic suppression. The combination of ABT-737 with rapamycin results
in sustained antitumor activity in PDX models, without signiﬁcant hematologic toxicity or weight loss, and in fact, the
thrombocytopenia of single-agent ABT-737 was abrogated in
the presence of rapamycin. The mechanisms responsible for
this potent combinatorial activity may include maintained
tumor expression of BAX, a key regulator of apoptotic induction. These data strongly support assessment of combined
targeted inhibition of Bcl-2 and mTOR pathway in patients
with SCLC.
