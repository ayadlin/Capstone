Abstract
7-Ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38), an active metabolite of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), has potent antitumor activity. Moreover, we have reported the strong
antitumor activity of NK012 (i.e., SN-38–releasing polymeric
micelles) against human cancer xenografts compared with
CPT-11. Here, we investigated the advantages of NK012 over
CPT-11 treatment in mouse models of gastric cancer with
peritoneal dissemination. NK012 or CPT-11 was i.v. administered thrice every 4 days at their respective maximum
tolerable doses (NK012, 30 mg/kg/day; CPT-11, 67 mg/kg/day)
to mice receiving orthotopic transplants of gastric cancer
cell lines (44As3Luc and 58As1mLuc) transfected with the
luciferase gene (n = 5). Antitumor effect was evaluated using
the photon counting technique. SN-38 concentration in
gastric tumors and peritoneal nodules was examined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1, 24, and
72 hours after each drug injection. NK012 or CPT-11
distribution in these tumors was evaluated using a fluorescence microscope on the same schedule. In both models, the
antitumor activity of NK012 was superior to that of CPT-11.
High concentrations of SN-38 released from NK012 were
detected in gastric tumors and peritoneal nodules up to
72 hours by HPLC. Only a slight conversion from CPT-11 to
SN-38 was observed from 1 to 24 hours. Fluorescence
originating from NK012 was detected up to 72 hours, whereas
that from CPT-11 disappeared until 24 hours. NK012 also
showed antitumor activity against peritoneal nodules. Thus,
NK012 showing enhanced distribution with prolonged SN-38
release may be ideal for cancer treatment because the
antitumor activity of SN-38 is time dependent. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of death from
cancer in the world. The survival rate has remained low in patients
with advanced gastric cancer, with a median survival rate of
13 months having been recently reported in a phase III trial, which

has been the best outcome thus far (1). Patients with gastric cancer
with scirrhous type stroma particularly showed poor prognosis
even after curative resection, as well as highly progressed peritoneal dissemination (2). Because peritoneal dissemination causes
several refractory symptoms such as massive ascites, intestinal
obstruction, hydronephrosis, and obstructive jaundice, the quality
of life of patients at the end stage of cancer is severely impaired.
Poor delivery of anticancer drugs to peritoneal metastatic cells
may be one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with
peritoneal dissemination (3). In peritoneal nodules, the distribution
and eventual diffusion of drugs to cancer cells tend to be impeded
because of several obstacles such as severe fibrosis and high
interstitial pressure (4, 5). On the other hand, angiogenesis was
reported to be an essential factor in the development of peritoneal
metastasis, and the high expression level of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in primary gastric tumors or ascitic fluid,
which can enhance tumor vascular permeability, was found to be
directly associated with the development of ascites and peritoneal
dissemination (6–10). In addition, several factors such as kinins
and nitric oxide are involved in tumor vascular permeability
(11–13). Polymer-conjugated drugs and nanoparticles categorized
under drug delivery system agents are favorably extravasated from
the vessels into the interstitium of tumors due to the enhanced
permeability and retention effect (EPR effect; refs. 14, 15). The
EPR effect is based on the following pathophysiologic characteristics of solid tumor tissues: hypervascularity, incomplete vascular
architecture, secretion of vascular permeability factors stimulating extravasation within cancer tissue, and absence of effective
lymphatic drainage from the tumors that impedes the efficient
clearance of macromolecules accumulated in solid tumor tissues.
Moreover, macromolecules cannot freely leak out from normal
vessels, and thus, the side effects of an anticancer agent can
be reduced. Very recently, we have shown that NK012 (i.e., SN38–releasing polymeric micelles) exerted superior antitumor
activity and less toxicity than CPT-11 (15–17). In a series of
studies, we showed that NK012 markedly enhanced the antitumor
activity of SN-38, particularly against highly VEGF-secreting SBC-3/
VEGF tumors compared with SBC-3/Neo tumors. On the other
hand, it is conceivable that satisfactory drug delivery cannot be
achieved in less-vascularized and highly fibrotic tumors, particularly for macromolecules. However, we observed that NK012
showed a strong antitumor activity even in the xenograft of Capan1
cells, which are pancreatic cancer cells with abundant stromal
tissue, compared with CPT-11. This result suggests that NK012 can
selectively accumulate in both hypervascular and hypovascular
tumors with high interstitial pressure, and then induce sustained

release of SN-38, followed by SN-38 distribution throughout the
entire tumor tissues. In the present study, we evaluated the
antitumor activity of NK012 against peritoneal tumor dissemination compared with that of CPT-11 using mouse models orthotopically transplanted with scirrhous gastric cancer cells, as well
as against spontaneously progressing peritoneal dissemination
(18, 19).

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures. 44As3 and 58As1m were previously reported as human
signet-ring cell gastric cancer cell lines that spontaneously metastasize to
the peritoneal cavity and produce large volumes of bloody ascites after
orthotopic implantion in the gastric wall (18–21). Here, 44As3 and 58As1m
cells were transfected with a complex of 4 Ag of pEGF-PLuc plasmid DNA
(Clontech) and 24 AL of GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene; Cloning Systems)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable transfectants
were selected in geneticin (400 Ag/mL; Invitrogen), and bioluminescence
was used to screen transfected clones for luciferase gene expression using
the IVIS system (Xenogen). Clones expressing the luciferase gene were
named 44As3Luc and 58As1mLuc. 44As3Luc and 58As1mLuc cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma), 100 IU/mL
penicillin G sodium, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate (ImmunoBiological Laboratories) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
at 37jC.
Orthotopic models in vivo. Six-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice
were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc., and maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions and provided with sterile food, water, and cages.
Ambient light was controlled to provide regular cycles of 12 h of light and
12 h of darkness. A total of 1  106 cells of 44As3Luc or 58As1Luc
were inoculated into the gastric wall of each mouse after laparotomy,
as described previously (18–21). In vivo photon counting analysis was
conducted on a cryogenically cooled IVIS system using Living Image
acquisition and analysis software (Xenogen). All animal procedures were
performed in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of

Experimental Animals established by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the National Cancer Center; these guidelines conform to the
ethical standards required by law and also comply with the guidelines for
the use of experimental animals in Japan.
Drugs. NK012 was prepared by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. (15). CPT-11 was
purchased from Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.
In vivo growth inhibition assay. After inoculation of 44As3Luc or
58As1mLuc cells into the gastric wall (day 0), mice were randomly divided
into test groups consisting of 5 mice per group. 44As3Luc mice were
i.v. administered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the 2 drugs via
the tail vein on days 20, 24, and 28 as previously reported, that is, at
66.7 mg/kg/d for CPT-11 and 30 mg/kg/d for NK012 (15). 58As1mLuc
mice were given the drugs in the same manner on days 18, 22, and 26.
Photon counting analysis and body weight were measured twice a week.
‘‘Visible ascites,’’ which was evident a few days before death in this
mouse model, was used as a surrogate for survival time in consideration
of animal welfare. Mice were euthanized when ascites became visible,
and colonization of gastric wall by cancer cells and metastasis to the
peritoneal cavity were confirmed in all the euthanized mice. Differences in
relative photon counts between the treatment groups at day 42 in 44As3Luc
mice and at day 81 in 58As1mLuc mice were analyzed using the unpaired
t test.
Assay of free SN-38 in tissues. We next analyzed the biodistributions of
NK012 and CPT-11 to orthotopic gastric tumors and peritoneal nodules.
Twenty-six days after the inoculation of 44As3Luc cells into the gastric wall
of mice, NK012 (30 mg/kg) or CPT-11 (66.7 mg/kg) was administered via the
tail vein. Under anesthesia, orthotopic gastric tumor and peritoneal nodule
samples were excised 1, 24, and 72 hours after injection.
Measurements of tissue concentration of free SN-38 by highperformance liquid chromatography. Samples were rinsed with physiologic saline, mixed with 0.1 mol/L glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.0)/methanol
at 5 w/w%, and then homogenized. To analyze the concentration of free
SN-38, 100 AL of the tumor samples were mixed with 20 AL of 1 mmol/L
phosphoric acid/methanol (1:1) and 40 AL of ultrapure water, and
camptothecin (CPT) was used as the internal standard (10 ng/mL for free
SN-38). The samples were vortexed vigorously for 10 s, and then filtered

through Ultrafree-MC Centrifugal Filter Devices with a cutoff molecular
diameter of 0.45 Am (Millipore Co.). Reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted at 35jC on a Mightysil
RP-18 GP column (150  4.6 mm; Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). Fifty
microliters of a sample were injected into an Alliance Water 2795 HPLC
system (Waters) equipped with a Waters 2475 multi E fluorescence detector.
Fluorescence originating from SN-38 was detected at 540 nm with an
excitation wavelength of 365 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of
100 mmol/l ammonium acetate (pH 4.2) and methanol [11:9 (v/v)], and
the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The content of SN-38 was calculated
by measuring the relevant peak area and calibrating against the corresponding peak area derived from the CPT internal standard. Peak data
were recorded using a chromatography management system (MassLynx
v4.0; Waters).
Visualization of distribution of NK012 and CPT-11 by fluorescence
microscopy. Mice were given fluorescein Lycopersicon esculentum lectin
(100 AL per mouse; Vector Laboratories) to visualize tumor vasculature in
the samples 5 min before anesthesia. The samples were then excised and
embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnochemical Co., Ltd.) and frozen at 80jC. Six-Am-thick tumor
sections were then prepared using a cryostatic microtome, Tissue-Tek
Cryo3 (Sakura Finetechnochemical Co., Ltd.). Frozen sections were
examined under a fluorescence microscope, BIOZERO (KEYENCE), at an
excitation wavelength of 377 nm and an emission wavelength 447 nm to
evaluate the distribution of NK012 and CPT-11. Both drugs could be
detected under the same fluorescence conditions because formulations
containing SN-38 bound via ester bonds possess a particular fluorescence.
Statistical analyses. Data were expressed as mean F SD. Data were
analyzed using the Student’s t test when groups showed equal variances
(F test), or the Welch’s test when they showed unequal variances (F test).
P value of <0.05 was considered as significant. All statistical tests were
two sided.

Results
Antitumor activities of NK012 and CPT-11. Comparison of the
relative photon counts on day 42 in the 44As3Luc mouse model
revealed significant differences in counts between mice given with
NK012 and those given with CPT-11 (P = 0.0282; Fig. 1A and B).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

Similar result was obtained in the experiment with 58As gastric
tumor (data not shown). The survival rates on day 150 in the
44As3Luc mouse model were 80% and 0% for the NK012 group
and CPT-11 group, respectively (Fig. 2). Similar result was obtained
in the experiment with 58As gastric tumor (data not shown).
No marked toxic effects in terms of body weight changes
were observed in any groups for any mouse models (data not
shown). Only 1 mouse in the CPT-11 group of 44As1 mouse models
showed diarrhea for 3 d, and any other clinical symptoms were
not observed.
Tissue concentrations of free SN-38 after administration of
NK012 and CPT-11. We examined the concentration-time profile
of free SN-38 in orthotopic gastric tumors and peritoneal nodules
in the 44As3Luc mouse model after the administration of NK012
and CPT-11 (Fig. 3A and B). Either orthotopic gastric tumors
or peritoneal nodules exhibited the highest concentration of
free SN-38 24 hours after NK012 administration, and 1 hour
after CPT-11 administration. The highest concentrations of free
SN-38 in the NK012 group were much higher than those in
the CPT-11 group in either orthotopic gastric tumors or peritoneal nodules. The concentrations of free SN-38 released from
NK012 in orthotopic gastric tumors were higher than those in
peritoneal nodules.
Tumor tissue distribution of NK012 and CPT-11 as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Results showed that NK012
accumulation in either orthotopic gastric tumors or peritoneal
nodules had been maintained from 1 hour to 72 hours after injection
(Fig. 4A). On the other hand, CPT-11 showed maximum accumulation in either orthotopic gastric tumors or peritoneal nodules
1 hour after injection and disappeared within 24 hours (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
The main purpose of this study was to clarify the advantages of
NK012 over CPT-11 as treatment against peritoneal metastasis
spontaneously disseminated from orthotopically transplanted
scirrhous gastric cancer cells in mouse models. We showed that
NK012 exerted more potent antitumor activity in the mouse
models used than CPT-11. Therefore, NK012 is considered
promising in terms of providing clinical benefit to patients with
gastric cancer showing progressing peritoneal dissemination.
CPT-11 is converted to SN-38, a biologically active and waterinsoluble metabolite of CPT-11, by carboxylesterases (CE) in the
liver and tumors. However, only 2% to 8% of administered CPT-11
is converted by CE in the liver and tumors to the active form SN-38
(22, 23). The conversion of CPT-11 to SN-38 also depends on
genetic interindividual variability of the activity of CE (24). Thus,
the direct use of SN-38 might be of great advantage and is
attractive for cancer treatment. We have recently shown that
NK012 (i.e., SN-38–releasing polymeric micelles) exerted superior
antitumor activity and less toxicity than CPT-11 (15–17). The mean
particle size of NK012 is 20 nm in diameter. NK012 can release
SN-38 under neutral conditions even in the absence of CE because
SN-38, which is bound to the blockcopolymer by phenolic ester
binding, is stable under acidic conditions but relatively labile under
neutral and mild alkaline conditions. The release rate of SN-38
from NK012 under physiologic conditions is quite high, that is,
>70% of SN-38 is gradually released within 48 hours.
In this study, we used mouse models with orthotopically
transplanted human scirrhous gastric cancer cells showing
spontaneously progressing peritoneal dissemination, which we

reported previously (18, 19, 21). These models can imitate more
realistically the progressing mode of human peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer than conventional experimental models
directly transplanted with cancer cells i.p. Moreover, our models
enabled us to quantitatively evaluate drug antitumor effect even
against peritoneal dissemination without having to sacrifice the
animal and perform autopsy through the use of gastric cancer cells
transfected with the luciferase gene and by applying photon
counting analysis, having already verified the significant correlation
between tumor volume and photon counts in a previous report (19).
For in vivo growth inhibition assay, drug administration was
started on day 18 or 20 after cell inoculation into the gastric wall,
when small peritoneal metastatic nodules and a small degree of
ascites had appeared. The present results showed that NK012 had
more potent antitumor activity than CPT-11 in the mouse models
tested, suggesting its effectiveness against peritoneal dissemination
of gastric cancer in the clinical setting.
In the pharmacologic evaluation, we could confirm the more
enhanced distribution of NK012 than CPT-11 to not only orthotopic
gastric tumors but also peritoneal nodules by quantifying SN-38
concentration in the tumors and visualization of fluorescence
originating from NK012 or CPT-11 distributed in the tumors.
Because CPT-11 or SN-38 has been reported to possess timedependent growth-inhibitory activity against tumor cells, this
prolonged retention of NK012 in the tumors and the sustained
release of free SN-38 from NK012 may be responsible for its more
potent antitumor activity observed in the present study (25). On the
other hand, CPT-11 disappeared from the tumors before exerting
sufficient antitumor activity. For both drugs, however, the concentrations of SN-38 in orthotopic gastric tumors were higher than those

(30 mg/kg) or CPT-11 (66.7 mg/kg). Each mouse was i.v. administered with
fluorescein-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum lectin just before being sacrificed
to detect tumor blood vessels. Frozen sections were examined under a
fluorescence microscope at an excitation wavelength of 377 nm and an emission
wavelength of 447 nm. The same fluorescence condition can be applied for
visualizing NK012 and CPT-11 fluorescence. Free SN-38 cannot be detected
under this fluorescence condition. A, distribution of NK012 or CPT-11 in

the poor delivery of anticancer drugs to peritoneal metastatic cells
probably because of some obstacles such as abundant interstitium
or high interstitial pressure. To date, we reported that NK012 can

more selectively accumulate and retain longer in various tumor
xenografts transplanted s.c. compared with CPT-11 (15–17). In the
present study, we succeeded in demonstrating higher accumulation
and longer retention of NK012 compared with CPT-11 in orthotopic
and peritoneal disseminated gastric cancer model that is closer to
human gastric cancer in clinics.
Peritoneal dissemination sometimes causes intestinal obstruction, which enhances the enterohepatic circulation of SN-38 after
direct damage to the small intestine, and makes the use of CPT-11
difficult (26, 27). In the present study, no mouse in the NK012 group
developed diarrhea. The dose-limiting toxic effects of CPT-11 seem
to be neutropenia and diarrhea. In our previous data, however,
there was no significant difference in the level of SN-38 in the small
intestine between mice treated with NK012 and mice treated with
CPT-11 despite the higher plasma area under the concentration of
NK012 than CPT-11 (15). Moreover, no serious diarrhea has been
reported even at the MTD dose in two phase I clinical trials against
advanced solid tumors in Japan and the US (28, 29).

disseminated grastic cancer.
