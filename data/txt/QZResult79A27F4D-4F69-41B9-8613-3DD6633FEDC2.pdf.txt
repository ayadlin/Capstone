Summary
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) regulate
normal development and homeostasis, and drive disease progression in many forms of cancer.
Both proteins signal by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases and heparan sulfate (HS)
proteoglycans on target cell surfaces. Basic residues comprising the primary HS binding sites on
HGF and VEGF provide similar surface charge distributions without underlying structural
similarity. Combining three acidic amino acid substitutions in these sites in the HGF isoform NK1
or the VEGF isoform VEGF165 transformed each into potent, selective competitive antagonists of
their respective normal and oncogenic signaling pathways. Our findings illustrate the importance
of HS in growth factor driven cancer progression and reveal an efficient strategy for therapeutic
antagonist development.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex polysaccharides present on
cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices that modulate cell growth and differentiation, and
in turn, embryogenesis, angiogenesis and homeostasis (reviewed in Sarrazin et al., 2011).
Their extended conformation and high negative charge enhance tissue integrity, and their
inherent complexity provides selective yet substantial protein binding capacity (Sarrazin et
al., 2011). Protein binding enables the formation of growth factor gradients during
development and reservoirs for factors needed rapidly for tissue repair and regeneration in
adults (Sarrazin et al., 2011). Cell surface HS proteoglycans form ternary complexes with
growth factors and their receptors, enhancing complex stability and signaling (Sarrazin et
al., 2011; Mohammadi et al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) bind
HS and regulate development and homeostasis (Ferrara, 2004; Matsumoto and Nakamura,
1996; Michalopoulos, 2007), and drive tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in many
cancers (Boccaccio and Comoglio, 2006; Ferrara, 2004; Peschard and Park, 2007). HGF
induces growth, motility, and morphogenesis in a variety of cell types via the Met receptor
kinase (Peschard and Park, 2007). VEGF-A is an essential regulator of angiogenesis
(Ferrara, 2004) that stimulates growth, motility and tubulogenesis in vascular endothelial
cells through the receptor kinases VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (Flk-1, KDR) and the coreceptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2 (Ferrara, 2004; Favier et al., 2006; GluzmanPoltorak et al., 2000).
The HGF and VEGF genes encode multiple isoforms. Mature HGF is a plasminogen-like
protein comprised of an amino-terminal heavy chain with four kringle motifs and a
carboxyl-terminal light chain with a serine protease-like domain (Matsumoto and Nakamura,
1996). Two truncated HGF isoforms also exist: the shorter of these retains HGF activities at
modestly reduced potency and consists of the amino-terminal (N) domain linked to kringle 1
(NK1) (Stahl et al., 1997). Within NK1, N contains the HS binding site (Hartmann et al.,
1998; Kinosaki et al., 1998; Lietha et al., 2001; Mizuno et al., 1994; Okigaki et al., 1992;
Sakata et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 1998) and K1 contains the primary Met
binding site (Lokker et al., 1994; Rubin et al., 2001).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

VEGF-A pre-mRNA splicing yields multiple VEGF-A isoforms, primarily VEGF121,
VEGF165 and VEGF189 (Ferrara, 2004). These contain the same binding sites for VEGFR1
and R2, but differ in HS binding capacity by the presence or absence of domains encoded by
exons 6 and 7 (Robinson and Stringer, 2001). Exon 7- and exon 8-encoded domains enable
VEGF-A to bind NRP1 (Appleton et al., 2007; Ferrara, 2004). Unlike VEGF165 and
VEGF189, VEGF121 lacks HS binding and is freely diffusible (Carmeliet et al., 1999). HS
binding has significant impact on VEGF-A biology: mice engineered to express only
VEGF121 display defective microvessel branching and lethality shortly after birth
(Carmeliet et al., 1999). Yet, even VEGF121 signaling is HS dependent: similar to fibroblast
growth factors (FGFs) and HGF, HS facilitates VEGF signaling through interactions with
both ligand and receptor (Lyon et al., 2002; Mohammadi et al., 2005; Rubin et al., 2001;
Sarrazin et al., 2011). Thus, complete disruption of HS function in VEGF signaling is likely
to mimic the embryonic lethality associated with homozygous deletions of VEGF, VEGFR,
or the HS proteoglycan perlecan (Ferrara, 2004; Sarrazin et al., 2011).
Basic residues critical for HS binding have been identified in HGF and VEGF165
(Chirgadze et al., 1999; Krilleke et al., 2007; Lietha et al., 2001; Ultsch et al., 1998; Zhou et
al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1999). Combined alanine substitutions in the VEGF165 HS binding
site resulted in reduced binding to NRP1 and VEGFR1 (Krilleke et al., 2007). Alanine

substitutions in the HS binding site of HGF (Kinosaki et al., 1998) or NK1 (Lokker et al.,
1994; Sakata et al., 1997) resulted in modest functional change. Negative charge
substitutions that more effectively disrupt HS binding distinguished functionally relevant
sites in HGF over earlier studies (Hartmann et al., 1998), so this strategy was used here to
further define the importance of HS binding for Met and VEGFR signaling.

Results
Substituted NK1 forms have normal folding and Met binding but diminished HS binding
and signaling
The highly conserved N domain residues K60, K62, and R73 form the primary HS binding
site in HGF, and R76, K78, R35 and R36 contribute secondarily (Chirgadze et al., 1999;
Lietha et al., 2001; Ultsch et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1999; Table S1).
Within the HS binding domain of VEGF165, residues R123, R124 and R159 are also highly
conserved and critical for heparin binding (Krilleke et al., 2007; Table S1). Although HGF
and VEGF have neither significant sequence identity nor similarity in peptide backbone
fold, the tripartite HS binding sites in both show a similar distribution of positive surface
charge (Figure S1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Expression plasmids were constructed that substituted acidic for basic residues to disrupt the
surface charge distribution on NK1: R73E (designated 1S), K60E/K62E (2S), and K60E/
K62E/R73E (3S). Substituted and wild type (WT) NK1 proteins were expressed and purified
to >99% homogeneity (Figure S2). To confirm proper folding of the substituted proteins,
their structures were compared with WT by NMR spectrometry (Figure 1). Minor shifts in
the pattern of 2D 1H-15N correlation spectra for substituted proteins overlaid on NK1 WT
spectra clustered near the substitution sites, indicating minimal perturbation of the 3D
structure in the substituted proteins.
Competitive binding experiments using ruthenium (Ru) tagged NK1 WT protein bound to
immobilized heparin with displacement by untagged WT or 3S proteins showed that binding
by the 3S form was 10-fold lower than WT (p < 0.001; Figure 2A). The IC50 for WT was
consistent with prior estimates of NK1- and NK2-heparin binding (Hartmann et al., 1998;
Rubin et al., 2001). Elution of the substituted proteins from a heparin affinity column by a
NaCl gradient also showed reduced binding relative to WT, most severely in NK1 3S,
reinforcing prior evidence that residues 60, 62, and 73 are sites of HS interaction (Table S2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Saturation binding of tagged NK1 WT and 3S proteins to a Met ectodomain-Ig fusion
protein in the presence of HS oligomer (4.2 kDa) or HS tetramer (1.2 kDa) produced similar
results (Figure 2B, C), indicating that Met binding was unchanged as anticipated.
Competitive displacement of HGF by NK1 WT or 3S also yielded IC50 values of ~1 nM
(data not shown). Saturation binding of tagged NK1 3S to the Met-Ig protein was unaffected
by the absence of HS (Figure 2B, triangles); in contrast, NK1 WT binding to Met-Ig in the
absence of HS was significantly compromised (Figure 2C, triangles). Heparin (18 kDa)
substituted effectively for either HS form in enhancing NK1 WT-Met binding (data not
shown). Together these results suggest that masking the positive surface charge of residues
60, 62 and 73 with bound HS in NK1 WT improves its Met binding affinity, and that this
was achieved artificially in NK1 3S by the negative charge substitutions.
Disruption of the primary HS binding site in NK1 diminished its biological activity in
cultured cells. Ligand-induced Met autophosphorylation in human epithelial (184B5) cells
was lower in cells treated with NK1 1S or 2S proteins relative to NK1 WT or HGF (data not
shown), and undetectable in cells treated with NK1 3S protein (Figure 2D). Ligandstimulated cell migration (Figure 2E) and mitogenesis (Figure 2F) revealed similar patterns

of functional compromise among the substituted NK1 forms: the 1S and 2S proteins showed
reduced activity (p < 0.01) and the 3S protein was inactive.

NK1-HS binding enables NK1 clustering, Met activation and signaling
Loss of signaling by NK1 3S despite native Met binding implied that HS binding enabled a
critical step in Met activation. HGF and NK1 are monomers in solution and it is thought that
long HS chains capable of binding several HGF molecules promote and stabilize ligand
clustering, and in turn the clustering of ligand-receptor complexes (Chirgadze et al., 1999;
Gherardi et al., 2006; Lietha et al., 2001; Hartmann et al., 1998; Rubin et al., 2001; Schwall
et al., 1996; Tolbert et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 1999). Consistent with this concept, 18 kDa
heparin or 4.2 kDa HS oligomer supported NK1 WT multimer formation detected after
covalent affinity crosslinking, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Figure 3A, lanes 4 and 8).
HS tetramers (1.2 kDa) unable to bind more than one NK1 molecule (Lyon et al., 2002) did
not support NK1 WT multimer formation (Figure 3A, lane 6). The masses of the NK1 WT
oligomers observed corresponded to dimers, trimers and tetramers of NK1 (Figure 3A). As
anticipated, HS-NK1 3S complexes were not detected (Figure 3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The impact of HS chain length on NK1-driven Met signaling was investigated using CHO
745 cells, which lack HS (Sarrazin et al., 2011). NK1-Met binding and NK1 clustering on
cell surfaces were found to be HS dependent in CHO 745 (Sakata et al., 1997). Consistent
with this and other studies (Lyon et al., 2002; Lyon et al., 2004), Met TK activation (Figure
3C) and consequent activation of Akt (Figure 3D), GSK3β (Figure 3E) and p70S6K (Figure
3F) by NK1 WT in this cell line was enhanced by added 18 kDa heparin. In contrast, added
1.2 kDa HS tetramer did not enhance NK1 WT signaling (Figure 3C–F), despite enabling
high affinity NK1-Met binding (Figure 2C). These observations suggest that the clustering
of NK1 afforded by longer HS chains stabilized NK1-Met complex oligomerization and in
turn, Met signaling. The elative order in which ligand-HS, ligand-Met, and Met-HS binding
events occur is unknown, and may be dictated by the relative abundance of HS and Met on
target cells. We note that HS tetramer enabled modest MAPK activation by HGF (Lyon et
al., 2002); as suggested by Stamos et al. (2004), the HGF light chain may contribute to
HGF/Met/HS complex dimerization through homotypic interactions between light-chain
protomers.
NK1 3S is a potent, selective competitive antagonist of NK1 and HGF signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The properties of the NK1 3S protein suggested that it might competitively antagonize HGF
activity. Indeed, addition of 3S protein to HGF- and NK1-treated cells resulted in dosedependent inhibition Met kinase activation in normal cells (Figure 4A, circles and squares).
The IC50 values for 3S inhibition of Met activation by HGF and NK1 WT were 6 nM, 10fold more potent than the Met antagonist PHA665752 (IC50 = 60 nM; Figure 4A, triangles).
NK1 WT-induced DNA synthesis was also inhibited by 3S protein, with >90% inhibition at
10-fold molar excess 3S over WT NK1 (Figure 4B, circles).
CD44 variants containing exon 6 (v6) are implicated in oncogenic Met signaling (OrianRousseau et al., 2002), and those containing exon 3 are often modified with HS and promote
HGF-Met interaction (van der Voort et al., 1999; Wielenga et al., 2000). CD44 variants
containing both exons occur frequently in colon and prostate cancer-derived cell lines, such
as HT29 and PC3M respectively, and in colon and prostate carcinomas, where their
expression correlates with poor prognosis (van der Voort et al., 1999; Wielenga et al., 2000).
We analyzed Met-CD44 association to determine if NK1 3S-Met binding affected this
process. CD44-Met association was induced by HGF or NK1 WT in HT29 cells (Figure 4C,
lanes 2 and 3) and by HGF in PC3M cells (Figure 4D, lane 2) but not by NK1 3S in either
cell line (Figure 4C, lane 4; Figure 4D, lane 6). In PC3M, NK1 3S antagonized HGF-

induced CD44-Met association in a dose-dependent manner, while PHA665752 was less
effective (Figure 4D, lanes 2–5 vs lanes 7–9).

Oncogenic autocrine HGF/Met signaling occurs frequently in glioblastoma (Boccaccio and
Comoglio, 2006) and drives tumorigenicity in the glioblastoma-derived cell line U87 MG.
Stable expression of NK1 3S in U87 MG cells significantly reduced proliferation relative to
cells expressing NK1 WT or empty vector (Figure 4E). HGF and Met protein levels were
comparable in the three cell lines, as were the levels of NK1 WT and 3S proteins (Figure
S3A-E). U87 MG cells do not express NK1 mRNA, thus reduced growth resulted from NK1
3S inhibition of endogenous HGF signaling.
We extended our initial analysis of NK1 3S inhibition of cell motility (Figure 2E) using the
MDCK cell scatter assay (Figure 4F). NK1 3S had no intrinsic scatter activity (Figure 4F,
3rd panel from left); inhibition of HGF-induced scatter was dose-dependent and complete at
50-fold molar excess (Figure 4F, right 3 panels).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NK1 3S also blocked anchorage independent growth by U87 MG cells (Figure 4G). U87
MG cells grow robustly in soft agar, (Figure 4G, left panel), but cells expressing NK1 3S
failed to form colonies under identical conditions (Figure 4G, 2nd panel from left). Colony
formation was also suppressed by adding purified NK1 3S protein to the medium, with
~50% inhibition by 70 nM 3S and complete blockade by 300 nM relative to controls (Figure
4G, 3rd and 4th panels from left); similar levels of inhibition were observed for PHA665752
(Figure 4G, right 2 panels).
The Met selectivity of NK1 3S antagonism was confirmed using the endothelial hybrid cell
line EA.hy 926, which expresses both Met and KDR. Cells were stimulated with either NK1
WT or VEGF165 in the presence or absence of 10-fold molar excess NK1 3S, and the
activation levels of Met, Akt, GSK3β and p70S6K were measured by 2-site immunoassays
(Figure S3F–I). NK1 3S did not activate Met or downstream effectors (Figure S3F–I left vs
right white bars). NK1 WT activated Met, Akt and its targets relative to control cells (Figure
S3F–I, left white vs left gray bars), and this signaling cascade was completely suppressed by
added excess NK1 3S (Figure S3F–I, right gray bars). In contrast, although VEGF165 fully
activated the Akt pathway, excess NK1 3S had no effect (Figure S3F–I, left vs right black
bars). Similar results were observed for VEGF165 activation of the MAPK pathway kinases
pERK-1/2, pJNK, and pp38 MAPK in the presence or absence of NK1 3S (data not shown).
NK1 3S inhibits HGF signaling, tumor growth and metastasis in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NK1 3S anti-tumor activity was first assessed by xenograft studies of transfected U87 MG
cell lines in SCID/Beige mice (Figure 5A). Animals receiving the U87 MG/NK1 WT cell
line started to develop tumors in 5 days (Figure 5A, squares) and tumor growth rate was
twice that of the control cell line (Figure 5A, circles), consistent with the additive effects of
ectopic NK1 WT and endogenous HGF. In contrast, tumor growth in animals receiving U87
MG/NK1 3S cells was not measurable before 50 days (Figure 5A, triangles). Like U87 MG,
the human leiomyosarcoma-derived cell line SK-LMS-1 has autocrine HGF/Met activation.
SK-LMS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids for NK1 WT, NK1 3S, or with empty
vector, and cell clones were selected for equivalent expression of endogenous HGF and Met,
and ectopic NK1 WT and NK1 3S proteins (Figure S3A–E). Again, NK1 WT expression
accelerated tumor growth (Figure 5B, squares), whereas NK1 3S expression reduced mean
tumor volume by 75% after 68 days relative to controls (Figure 5B, triangles vs. circles; p <
0.001). Tumors resected from these mice displayed equivalent Met content among the three
groups (not shown); Met activation was highest in NK1 WT transfectant tumors (Figure 5C,
black bar), significantly lower in tumors from controls (Figure 5C, gray bar) and lowest in
tumors from the NK1 3S implanted group (Figure 5C, white bar; p < 0.001).

HGF/Met signaling is a critical contributor to tumor metastasis (Boccaccio and Comoglio,
2006). NK1 3S was tested in the B16 murine melanoma model of induced metastasis, where
endogenous HGF drives metastatic colonization. B16 cells expressing luciferase (B16-luc)
were used to enable tumor burden assessment by optical imaging. Metastasis in animals
injected with B16-luc cells expressing NK1 3S was compared to metastasis in animals
injected with empty vector cells, and with metastasis in animals injected with the empty
vector cells and then treated by daily intraperitoneal (IP) injection of purified NK1 3S
protein at 50 mg/kg (Figure 5D). Metastatic burden rose rapidly in the mice receiving empty
vector cells (Figure 5D, circles), whereas mice receiving 3S plasmid bearing cells (Figure
5D, squares) or control cells and IP treatment with 3S protein (Figure 5D, triangles) showed
few, if any, metastases by study termination (p < 0.001). Lung specimens from each group
examined ex vivo at study termination for melanin-producing colonies were consistent with
the imaging results (data not shown). The B16-luc melanoma model was also used for a
preliminary dose-ranging study where mice received IP injections of NK1 3S protein at day
2 post-tail vein injection and daily thereafter for 15 days at 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg (Figure S4).
Significant metastatic suppression was observed at every NK1 3S dose (p < 0.001).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The anti-metastatic efficacy of NK1 3S was also evaluated in the PC3M spontaneous
metastasis model (Figure 5E). The PC3M cells used in these studies also expressed
luciferase for metastatic burden assessment. Palpable subcutaneous primary tumors
developed within 5 days after cell implantation; mice then received daily IP injections of
purified NK1 3S protein at 5 or 25 mg/kg, or vehicle alone. Primary tumor growth was
measured at regular intervals using calipers and metastatic burden was measured by imaging
at study termination. Interestingly, NK1 3S treatment had no significant effect on primary
tumor growth in this model (data not shown), however, a significant and dose-dependent
inhibition of metastasis was observed, with 80% reduction at 25 mg/kg (p < 0.01; Figure
5E).
Analysis of NK1 3S pharmacokinetics in mice (n = 6) showed that plasma NK1 level peaked
between 1 and 3 hours after a single IP injection (50 mg/kg) and declined thereafter (Figure
5F). Plasma NK1 3S concentration 24h post-injection was ~150 ng/ml, or ~300-fold over
typical murine plasma HGF levels. Mice treated daily with this dose for 10 days showed no
weight loss, lethargy or other signs of toxicity. Mice (n = 5) treated on this dose and
schedule but not implanted with tumor cells displayed normal clinical blood chemistry,
differential blood cell count and hematocrit values; full necropsy analysis of all tissues and
organs showed no signs of toxicity or abnormality (data not shown).
VEGF165 3S is a potent competitive VEGF antagonist

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether the strategy used to transform NK1 from agonist to antagonist could
be generalized, we generated a cDNA encoding opposite charge substitutions at the critical
HS binding residues identified by Krilleke et al. (2007) in VEGF165 (R123E/R124E/R159E,
or VEGF165 3S). Plasmids encoding vector alone, VEGF165 WT, or VEGF165 3S were
stably transfected into HEK293 cells that had been engineered previously to express 2.5 ×
106 VEGFR2 per cell (293/KDR; Backer et al., 2005). VEGF165 WT expression in these
cells was expected to result in autocrine KDR activation and transformation, whereas
VEGF165 3S was expected to lack KDR activating ability and have no effect on phenotype.
Ectopic VEGF protein production by transfectants was measured using a 2-site
immunoassay with a 1.5 pM detection limit. Marker selected cultures of WT transfectants
produced ~1.0 ng/ml/24h VEGF165 protein in conditioned media, 3S transfectants produced
~2.5 ng/ml/24h, and VEGF protein was undetectable in vector control media (Figure 6A).
Like VEGF165 WT, VEGF 3S dimers and monomers of expected mass were detected under
non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively (Figure 6B). Saturation binding of
VEGF165 3S to KDR in vitro (Figure 6C, squares; KD ~19 pM) was equivalent to

VEGF165 WT binding (Figure 6C, circles; KD ~23 pM) and consistent with published
values (Ferrara, 2004).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

VEGF165 3S also antagonized VEGF165 WT signaling in intact cells. Concentrated
conditioned media harvested from 3S transfectants was added to 293/KDR cells in the
presence of purified VEGF165 WT protein and phospho-KDR levels were measured (Figure
7A, B). Since the conditioned media could contain other inhibitors of KDR activation,
VEGF165 3S was selectively removed from the media by immunodepletion with anti-VEGF
antibody. A mock-immunodepletion was performed in parallel using a non-specific antibody
and the VEGF165 3S content of the anti-VEGF and mock-immunodepleted media was
measured (Figure 7A). VEGF 3S levels in non-immunodepleted and mock immunodepleted
media were similar (1.93 and 1.89 ng/mg total cell protein, respectively; Figure 7A, white
bars), while immunodepletion with anti-VEGF removed 95% of the 3S protein (0.096 ng/mg
total cell protein; Figure 7A, gray bar). VEGF was not detected in media from empty vector
transfectants before or after immunodepletion (Figure 7A, right). KDR autophosphorylation
stimulated by purified VEGF165 protein (10 ng/ml) in serum-deprived 293/KDR cells
(Figure 7B) was inhibited modestly by VEGF-immunodepleted media (Figure 7B, circles),
but mock-immunodepleted media showed significant, dose-dependent inhibition, with >80%
inhibition by media containing 2.5-fold molar excess VEGF 3S protein (Figure 7B,
triangles). In soft agar colony formation assays, robust growth of 293/KDR cells transfected
with VEGF165 WT (Figure 7C, upper left panel) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
by the VEGFR inhibitor pazopanib (Figure 7C, middle and right upper panels), providing
additional evidence that colony formation was driven by autocrine VEGF/KDR signaling.
VEGF165 3S protein added at 0.06, 0.15 and 0.6 nM also resulted in significant, dosedependent inhibition (Figure 7C, lower panels).

KDR autophosphorylation in each cell line was measured after 24 h of serum deprivation
(Figure 6D). The basal KDR phosphorylation level in empty vector transfectants (Figure 6D,
white bar) was similar to that of the parental cell line (not shown) and 3S transfectants
(Figure 6D, dark gray bar). In contrast, WT transfectant basal KDR phosphorylation level
was 4-fold higher than control or 3S (Figure 6D, light gray bar; p < 0.001). The KDR
autophosphorylation level of the vector transfectant after 20 min exposure to added
VEGF165 protein (2.5 nM) is shown for reference (Figure 6D, black bar). Consistent with
the levels of KDR activation among the transfectants, significant differences in cell
proliferation rate were observed from day 3 onward: WT transfectants (Figure 6E, squares)
grew significantly faster than the vector control (Figure 6E, circles) or 3S transfectants
(Figure 6E, triangles; p < 0.001 between WT and control or WT and 3S for days 3–5). These
results indicated that WT transfectants, but not 3S transfectants, had acquired autocrine
VEGF signaling, even though 3S protein production was twice that of WT. In soft agar
colony formation assays, empty vector and 3S transfectants grew modestly, if at all (Figure
6F, left and middle panels), whereas WT transfectants grew robustly (Figure 6F, right
panel). All of these results indicated loss of signaling by VEGF165 3S despite native KDR
binding.

Analysis of the spectrum of VEGF 3S antagonism showed that VEGF165 3S inhibited
placenta growth factor (PlGF)-induced Akt activation (phospho-Akt/total Akt) in EA.hy 926
cells, which express VEGFR1 and R2, with potency similar to pazopanib (Figure 7D). In
contrast, VEGF 3S did not block Akt activation induced by VEGF-D in SCC-25 cells, which
express VEGFR1, R2 and R3 (Figure S5A, B). Thus the pattern of VEGF 3S inhibition
followed the pattern of VEGF-A binding to VEGFR1 and R2, but not homodimers of
VEGFR3, as anticipated (Ferrara, 2004).

VEGF165 3S antagonism was independent of NRP1-VEGF-A protein-protein interaction.
NRP1 binds to the VEGF-A HS binding domain primarily at R165 and secondarily at K147,
E152 and E155 (Parker et al., 2012), i.e., to a surface opposite that of HS (Figure S5C).
Crosslinking studies further showed that VEGF165 WT and VEGF165 3S bound similarly
to NRP1 in vitro (Figure S5D). Functionally, VEGF165 3S antagonized VEGF signaling
similarly in 293/KDR derived cells (Figure 7B, C and E), which lack NRP1 (Figure S5E,
lanes 4–6), and in EA.hy 926 cells (Figure 7D) which are NRP1 positive (Figure S5E, lane
2). The NRP1 present in our experiments was not HS modified, which is thought to promote
NRP1 multimerization and in turn NRP1-VEGFR2 binding and signaling (Shintani et al.,
2006). Like NK1, we found that heparin promoted clustering of VEGF165 WT, but not of
VEGF165 3S (Figure S5F). Thus, if HS-modified NRP1 enhances VEGF signaling in part
by promoting VEGF clustering, VEGF165 3S would be expected to antagonize that process.
VEGF 3S inhibits VEGF-driven tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test whether VEGF165 3S protein could antagonize KDR-driven tumorigenicity in mice,
animals were implanted subcutaneously with VEGF165 WT transfected 293/KDR cells (3 ×
106 per animal), with the same number of VEGF165 3S transfected cells, or with a
suspension containing 1.5 × 106 cells of each line. Additional control groups received the
empty vector 293/KDR cells (3 × 106 per animal) or the empty vector cells combined with
VEGF WT transfectants at 1.5 × 106 cells each. The latter group indicated the growth rate of
tumors arising from 1.5 × 106 VEGF WT transfectants in the presence of “neutral” cells
providing the same initial mass; a growth rate below this threshold in the group implanted
with VEGF WT + VEGF 3S transfectants could be attributed to inhibition of VEGF WTdriven tumor growth by VEGF165 3S. Indeed, VEGF WT transfected 293/KDR cells
formed tumors fastest (Figure 7D, blue squares), whereas VEGF 3S transfectants did not
form tumors prior to study termination (Figure 7D, gray inverted triangles), and animals
implanted with the WT + 3S cell mix (Figure 7D, green diamonds) formed tumors at a
significantly lower rate than the control WT + empty vector group (Figure 7D, red triangles)
throughout the study (p < 0.05).

Tumorigenesis by the parental cell line, despite its inability to grow in soft agar, indicated
that is was driven by host VEGF. This conclusion is supported by prior work where the
generation of knock-in mice expressing a humanized form of VEGF-A was needed to
overcome incomplete suppression of human tumor xenograft growth by anti-human VEGFA antibodies that did not block murine VEGF activity (Gerber et al., 2007). Therefore, the
failure of the 3S transfectants to form tumors indicates VEGF 3S antagonism of
tumorigenesis driven by murine VEGF. Moreover, significant inhibition of tumor growth by
VEGF165 3S in animals receiving the WT + 3S transfectant cell mix indicates antagonism
of the combined impact of paracrine murine VEGF and autocrine human VEGF.
Tumor angiogenesis was also significantly blocked in mice receiving VEGF 3S transfected
cells (Figure 8). Immunohistochemisty using anti-CD34 showed that the extent of tumor
vascularization, from highest to lowest, was 293/KDR/WT VEGF transfectants alone
(Figure 8A), 293/KDR/WT VEGF cells + vector transfected 293/KDR cells mixed 1:1
(Figure 8B), vector transfectants alone (Figure 8C), and 293/KDR/WT VEGF + 293/KDR/
3S VEGF transfectants mixed 1:1 (Figure 8D). This pattern is consistent with tumor
angiogenesis driven by both autocrine human and paracrine murine VEGF (panels A and B)
relative to tumor angiogenesis driven by murine VEGF alone (panel C), and with substantial
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by VEGF 3S (panel D).
Histopathology analysis indicated that the tumors formed by 293/KDR cell transfectants
(vector, VEGF WT, VEGF WT + vector, VEGF WT + VEGF 3S) were uniformly

Discussion
Our work builds on several prior studies showing that HS-HGF interaction is critical for
HGF signaling (Hartmann et al., 1998; Lietha et al., 2001; Sakata et al., 1997; Schwall et al.,
1996; Zioncheck et al., 1995). The loss of biological activity by combined substitution of
K60, K62 and R73 with acidic residues identifies this surface region as essential for NK1
biological signaling, and implies that HS binding at secondary sites is not sufficient for NK1
signaling. The partial loss of activity associated with substitutions at 73 and 60/62 suggests
that each contribute to HS interactions at this site. Our results further indicate that HS-NK1
interactions promote receptor activation and signaling by enhancing NK1-Met interaction
and by stabilizing NK1 multimers, which may in turn facilitate receptor clustering, kinase
activation and effector recruitment (Gherardi et al., 2006; Hartmann et al., 1998; Lietha et
al., 2001; Sakata et al., 1997; Schwall et al., 1996; Tolbert et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We believe that three critical features define the mechanism of HGF inhibition by NK1 3S:
[1] retention of optimal N domain-Met binding through negative charge substitutions in
NK1 3S that mimic occupancy of the primary HS binding site; a prior report provides
structural evidence to this effect (Tolbert et al., 2010); [2] repulsion of HS from the ligandreceptor complex by the negative charge substitutions; and [3] competitive displacement of
HGF from Met by the native K1 domain of NK1 3S. We propose that occupancy of the
primary ligand binding site in Met without HS support of ligand-Met complex clustering and
associated conformational changes results in signaling blockade.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to its value as a research tool, NK1 3S may have therapeutic potential. The
critical role of HGF-Met signaling in a variety of human cancers has made Met an important
anti-cancer drug target. Met blockade has been achieved using ATP binding site antagonists,
neutralizing antibodies, decoy receptors, and single-chain HGF derivatives (Cecchi et al.,
2010), synthetic HS mimetics (Fuster and Esko, 2005), and engineered NK1 forms affecting
the dimerization interface in K1 (Tolbert et al., 2010; Youles et al., 2008). Like the latter,
NK1 3S blocks signaling by disrupting ligand dimer/multimer formation, but unlike those
mutants it does so by blocking HS facilitation of that process. Each of these approaches has
advantages as well as limitations. Our choice to develop NK1 instead of full-length HGF is
based on the complexity of HGF protein and the technical obstacles this imposes on its
manufacture. The challenges of administering large HGF-derived antagonists such as NK4
and uncleavable pro-HGF have been met by using viral vectors or naked DNA plasmids
(Cecchi et al., 2010). These methods can provide sustained delivery but do not allow the
level of control inherent in administering the encoded proteins. NK1 can be expressed in P.
pastoris at yields high enough (>1 g/L) to be commercially tractable. Our results support the
efficacy of systemically delivered NK1 3S protein as an anti-tumor and anti-metastatic
agent, as well as its practicality as an alternative to larger HGF-derived antagonists.
We find that VEGF165 3S binds KDR like VEGF165 WT protein, fails to induce KDR
kinase activity and antagonizes VEGF165 WT binding and signaling in vitro and in vivo. A
critical distinction between VEGF165 3S and alanine substitutions made at these positions
(Krilleke et al., 2007), or the VEGF isoform VEGF121, is that the opposite charge
substitutions in VEGF 3S are designed to repel HS and thereby disrupt both ligand-HS and
weaker receptor-HS interactions. The striking parallels in antagonism by 3S forms of NK1
and VEGF165 strengthen our assertion of a common role for HS in receptor activation and
show that targeted disruption of critical HS binding sites is an antagonist development
strategy that can be extended to other HS-binding growth factors. Consistent with findings

for NK1, VEGF-HS interaction occurs through sulfated HS side-chains and three key VEGF
residues, with secondary contributions from one or two others (Krilleke et al., 2007). The
analogous roles of HS in NK1/Met and VEGF165/KDR signaling, in the absence of
underlying structural similarity, suggests that this occurs through convergent evolution.
Thus, any similarity in the spatial arrangement of the primary HS binding site surfaces
themselves would be driven by adaptation to the common binding partner, HS, as opposed
to a common ancestral protein sequence or structure.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The present understanding of KDR activation by VEGF165 and HS suggests a mechanistic
basis for signaling antagonism by the targeted disruption of HS-ligand binding. The VEGF
binding site in KDR encompasses IgG-like domains (D) 1–3: D2 contains primary contacts
and D1 and D3 contribute to overall binding affinity and specificity (Christinger et al., 2004;
Fuh et al., 1998). Consistent with findings presented here for NK1, HS was found to be
required for high affinity binding of VEGF165 to KDR ectopically expressed in HSnegative CHO 745 cells (Dougher et al., 1997). Similar to Met (Rubin et al., 2001) and FGF
receptors (Mohammadi et al., 2005), KDR also interacts directly with HS, through at least
one site located between D6 and D7 (Dougher et al., 1997). Recent structural studies of KIT,
PDGFR and VEGFR highlight the importance of homotypic receptor-receptor interaction
domains in stabilizing receptor dimerization and kinase transactivation: direct contacts
between D4 domains for KIT and D7 domains for KDR are enabled by ligand-induced
conformational changes in the receptor ectodomain (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010; Tao
et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2010). In these models, sequential binding events promote and
incrementally stabilize HS-ligand-receptor aggregates capable of signaling. We hypothesize
that VEGF165 first binds KDR D2; the weaker VEGF165-D1 and -D3 interactions may be
stabilized by HS-VEGF interaction and by HS-VEGF-KDR bridging at D6/D7. For
VEGF165 3S, receptor binding at D2 should occur, but subsequent weaker interactions
normally stabilized by HS and induced changes in receptor conformation could fail. VEGFHS interactions also may also induce conformational changes that enable the apposition of
KDR D7 domains (Wijelath et al., 2010) and in turn, homotypic interaction and kinase
transactivation; VEGF165 3S is likely to disrupt such events. The role of NRP1 in VEGF
signaling is complex, involving protein-protein interactions and protein-HS interactions
when NRP1 is HS modified (Shintani et al., 2006). VEGF165 3S engages NRP1 via the
former, but would be expected to disrupt the latter. Collectively, our observations
underscore the importance of specific HS interactions in facilitating events after ligand
binding which are required for KDR activation, and expose their susceptibility to targeted
disruption.

HS binding growth factors promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in a variety
of human cancers. In addition to the strategy described here, oligosaccharide HS mimetics
and modified heparin fragments can act as HS binding antagonists (Fuster and Esko, 2005).
However, the complexity of HS GAGs challenges the development of potent and selective
agents, and frequent alterations in HS GAG composition in tumors (Fuster and Esko, 2005)
may render such agents less competitive for ligand binding. In contrast, opposite
substitutions to critical HS binding residues in an otherwise wild type protein ligand are
simple to introduce, unaffected by tumor HS GAG composition, and inherently pathway
selective. These features suggest that it may be an expedient and practical route for the
development of antagonists of HS binding growth factors.

Plasmids for NK1 and VEGF165, Protein Expression and Purification

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NK1 proteins were produced in E. coli as described (Stahl et al., 1997). Plasmids for
expression of NK1 3S, NK1 WT, VEGF165 WT and VEGF165 3S under CMV promoters
possess their native signal peptide sequences and G418 resistance. Plasmids for P. pastoris
expression of NK1 proteins were generated and protein purified as described in
Supplemental Information.
NMR Structural Analysis
Isotope-labeled proteins were expressed E. coli in minimal media containing either 15NH4Cl
or both 15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose. Triple-labeled proteins (15N/13C/2H) were
prepared similarly except the media contained 98% D2O. 1H-15N correlation spectra for
substituted and WT NK1 proteins were collected as described (Zhou et al., 1999). NK1
backbone resonance assignments were made using 15N/13C/2H-NK1 and standard triple
resonance experiments.
Immunoassays and Binding Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Met, KDR, HGF, and VEGF content in cell lysates, tissue extracts and conditioned media
was determined using 2-site immunoassays developed for use with the Meso Scale
Discovery (MSD) SectorImager 2400 plate reader; HGF and Met assays are described in
Supplemental Information; other assays were from MSD. Met and KDR activation in cell
lysates or tumor tissue extracts included parallel detection with anti-receptor antibodies and
specific anti-phospho-receptor antibodies or 4G10 (Millipore).
Binding assays were also performed on the MSD platform. NK1 saturation binding to
immobilized Met ectodomain-IgG fusion protein was measured using Ru tagged WT or 3S
ligand. Displacement experiments included multiple untagged ligand concentrations in the
presence of Ru tagged ligand. NK1-HS saturation binding to immobilized heparin-biotin
was measured using Ru tagged NK1 WT or 3S proteins. KDR-Ig ectodomain saturation
binding to immobilized VEGF165 WT or 3S was measured using Ru tagged anti-KDR. All
measurements were made on triplicate samples. GraphPad Prism v5.0 was used for all
statistical analyses. Additional details are included in Supplemental Information.
Cell Motility, Mitogenesis, and Colony Formation Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell motility in modified Boyden chambers and DNA synthesis by [3H]-thymidine
incorporation were measured as described (Rubin et al., 2001). MDCK cell scatter was
assessed as described (Stahl et al., 1997). U87 MG or 293/KDR derived cell line
proliferation in quadruplicate wells of 6-well plates was measured by counting in a
Cellometer (Nexcelom Bioscience). Assays for colony formation in soft agar were
performed as described (Castagnino et al., 2000). Differences between mean values were
determined by t-test using GraphPad Prism v5.0.
Tumorigenesis, Metastasis and Pharmacokinetic Assays
Experiments with SCID/Beige mice were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines for
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute.
Details for all animal studies are included in Supplemental Information. Briefly, U87 MG,
SK-LMS-1 or 293/KDR derived cell lines were injected subcutaneously into mice and tumor
volumes were calculated from caliper measurements. 293/KDR cell derived tumors were
harvested at study termination for histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis of
murine CD34 protein localization. B16-luc derived cells for induced metastasis studies were
injected via the tail vein; in some studies mice also received daily IP injections of purified

NK1 3S (or vehicle) at doses indicated in the text. For spontaneous metastasis studies,
PC3M-luc cells were implanted subcutaneously and mice were treated by IP injection of
vehicle or NK1 3S starting on day 5. Metastatic burden was determined by luciferase
imaging. Plasma NK1 3S levels were measured mice after a single IP injection of NK1 3S at
the indicated times post-injection. NK1 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting. Statistical analysis, curve fitting and IC50 determinations were performed
using GraphPad Prism v5.0.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are widely expressed, structurally diverse
biopolymers that modulate many important protein-protein interactions. Hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) regulate
development and homeostasis, and drive tumorigenesis, tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis in many forms of cancer. We show that targeted disruption of specific HS
binding residues in HGF and VEGF yields selective competitive inhibitors of these
pathways. The similar roles of HS in enabling receptor activation, in the absence of
underlying structural similarity, suggests that this occurs through convergent
evolutionary adaptation to the common binding partner, HS. Our results reveal an
efficient strategy for the development of antagonists of these and potentially other HS
binding growth factors with widespread involvement in cancer.
