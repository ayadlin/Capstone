BACKGROUND: The authors assessed the impact of germline polymorphisms on clinical outcome in patients with
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received platinum-gemcitabine (PG) chemotherapy. METHODS: In
total, 137 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were included who received first-line PG chemotherapy (74% of patients
received cisplatin, and 26% received carboplatin). Twenty-three germline polymorphisms that were identified in peripheral blood samples were analyzed for progression-free survival (PFS), treatment response, overall survival (OS),
and toxicity. RESULTS: The median PFS was 5.8 months, the median OS was 10.2 months, and 44 patients (32%) had
a partial treatment response. Carriers of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) mutant thymine
(T) allele had a lower treatment response rate (29% vs 52%; P ¼ .02), shorter PFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.60;
P ¼ .04), and shorter OS (adjusted HR, 1.54; P ¼ .05) compared with carriers of the wild-type cytosine/cytosine (CC)
genotype. The xeroderma pigmentosum group A member 10 (XPD10) mutant adenine (A) allele (adjusted HR, 0.64;
P ¼ .04) and the x-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) mutant guanine (G) allele (adjusted HR, 0.51; P ¼ .02)
also were independent predictors of OS. Carriers of the mutant adenosine triphosphate-dependent DNA helicase Q1
(RECQ1) C allele or the mutant cytidine deaminase (CDA) C allele were more likely to experience severe leukocytopenia (26% vs 10% [P ¼ .03] and 28% vs 11% [P ¼ .02], respectively) compared with wild-type genotype carriers.
Patients who carried the homozygous mutant glutathione S-transferase p 1(GSTP1) GG genotype were at considerable
risk for severe platinum-associated polyneuropathy (18% vs 3% in wild-type vs heterozygous mutant patients, respectively; P ¼ .01). CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first prospective study to date in patients with
advanced NSCLC describing predictive germline polymorphisms not only for the clinical activity of PG chemotherapy
(ERCC1, XPD10) but also for its toxicity (GSTP1, RECQ1, CDA). Nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy in carriers of

tolerability profile.1,2 Overall mortality is reduced by
10% with CG compared with other platinum-containing
regimens, resulting in an absolute survival benefit at 1
year of 3.9%.1 DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide
excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), are
critical for the activity of platinum-based chemotherapy.3
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1
(ERCC1), xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), and
xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) are key enzymes
of the NER pathway. The cytosine/cytosine (C/C) genotype in codon 118 of ERCC1 was considered a favorable
marker of survival in some studies,4-6 but not in
others.7-10 The guanine-to-adenine substitution at codon
312 (G312A) of XPD has not been identified to date as a
predictor of clinical outcome,4,6 except in 1 study that was
presented only as an abstract.11 There are conflicting data
on the effect of the G allele in codon 399 of x-ray crosscomplementing group 1 (XRCC1) on clinical outcome in
patients with advanced NSCLC.11-14 The thymine (T) allele in codon 241 of XRCC3 was identified as a favorable
marker of survival in 1 clinical study.7 For gemcitabine,
different drug pathway-associated gene polymorphisms
have been described,15,16 but their clinical relevance
remains largely unknown. The objective of the current
study was to quantify the impact of selected drug pathway-associated gene polymorphisms on chemotherapyassociated toxicity and clinical outcome in patients with
advanced NSCLC receiving standard first-line platinumgemcitabine chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
This multicenter prospective study was initiated in 2005.
Eligible patients had histologically or cytologically documented, advanced (stage IIIB or stage IV) or recurrent
NSCLC and were considered for first-line chemotherapy
with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Patients with contraindications for cisplatin, such as renal function impairment,
polyneuropathy, or tinnitus, received carboplatin. Other
inclusion criteria included age 18 years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
2; measurable or evaluable disease according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST);
and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
Main exclusion criteria included radiotherapy within the
last 3 weeks before study entry, patients unsuitable for
adequate follow-up, and evidence of uncontrolled systemic disease. The protocol was approved by local inde-

pendent ethics committees, and the study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the International Conference on Harmonization Tripartite Guideline. All patients provided written informed consent.
Study Design
Gemcitabine was administered intravenously at a dose of
1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by
either cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 as a 4-hour intravenous infusion or carboplatin over 30 minutes on day 1. Carboplatin
was given at an area under the concentration-time curve
of 5 according to the modified Calvert formula, and the
glomerular filtration rate was calculated according to the
Cockroft-Gault formula. Cycles were repeated every 3
weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles unless there was evidence
of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary study objective was to correlate known functional
polymorphisms of DNA-repair genes and drug-metabolizing genes with progression-free survival (PFS) in
patients with advanced NSCLC who were receiving firstline platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy.
Safety and Efficacy Assessments
Tumor status was determined every second treatment
cycle during study treatment by computed tomography
scans and every 2 months thereafter until disease progression. Tumor response was assessed according to RECIST,
in which a complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, a partial response is defined as a
decrease 30% in the sum of the greatest dimension of
target lesions from baseline, progressive disease is defined
as an increase 20% in the sum of the greatest dimension
of target lesions from baseline, and stable disease is
defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.17 Adverse events were assessed at weekly
intervals, were graded using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version
3.0, and were coded according to the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Geneva,
Switzerland). Hematologic measurements were performed at weekly intervals. Patients were followed until
death.
Genetic Analyses
The following germline mutations were analyzed in peripheral blood from all patients: XRCC1 A399G; XRCC3

Research, Waltham, Mass). DNA sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/
d IJssel, The Netherlands) on an ABI Prism 3100 DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For sequence alignment,
the SEQSCAPE bioinformatics software package (version
2.1; Applied Biosystems) was used. Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium was evaluated for each genotype. The investigators performing genetic analyses (V.D.D. and
P.H.M.S.) were blinded to patient characteristics and
clinical outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
The primary study endpoint was PFS, which was calculated from the start of chemotherapy to the first documented disease progression (defined according to
RECIST17) or death, whichever occurred first. Patients
without documented progression or death were censored
at the last tumor assessment. Secondary endpoints
included objective tumor response, overall survival (OS),
and chemotherapy-associated adverse events. The plan
for the study was to have 75% power to detect a 25%
improvement in PFS at 9 months with a type-I error of
5% (2-sided test) when the expected survival at 9 months
was 20% in patients with the nonfavorable genotype and
30% in the patients with the favorable genotype. Demographic and clinical information was compared across
genotypes using Fisher exact tests (for binary variables)
and Wilcoxon-type tests for trend (for ordinal variables
with 3 levels). The association between PFS or OS and
the genotypes was estimated using the method of Kaplan
and Meier and was assessed using log-rank tests initially
with 2 degrees of freedom, and subsequently with 1
degree of freedom after grouping heterozygotes with either wild type or homozygotes. Median follow-up was

2468

calculated using OS duration with deaths censored. Cox
proportional hazards models for PFS were used to determine the impact of the genotypes on PFS and OS,
adjusting for patient age, sex, tumor stage, performance
status, and smoking status. All tests of significance were
2-sided. Given the explorative nature of this study, no
multitest adjustments were made. We considered associations significant at the .05 level. All analyses were performed using Stata 11.0 software (Stata Corp., College
Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Patient, Treatment, and Follow-Up
Characteristics
In total, 146 patients with advanced NSCLC from 4 centers were consented between November 2005 and November 2008. Patients were recruited in the Netherlands
Cancer Institute (n ¼ 133), the Free University Medical
Center Amsterdam (n ¼ 4), the Kennemer Hospital Harlem (n ¼ 3), and Alkmaar Medical Center (n ¼ 6). We
excluded 6 patients with inadequate source data, 2
patients with no evaluable tumor, and 1 patient with stage
IIB NSCLC, for a final study population of 137 patients
(Table 1). The first-cycle platinum compound was cisplatin in 101 patients (74%) and carboplatin in 36 patients
(26%). Cisplatin was changed to carboplatin in 15
patients for renal impairment (8 patients), peripheral neuropathy (6 patients), or cisplatin-related hearing impairment (1 patient). The median follow-up was 3 years and 4
months, the median PFS was 5.8 months, and the median
OS was 10.2 months. Treatment response was a partial
response in 44 patients (32%), stable disease in 79
patients (58%), progressive disease in 11 patients (8%),
and not evaluable in 3 patients (2%). Tumor response was
measurable in 105 patients (77%).
Allele Frequency
All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
The DCK promoter polymorphisms C360G and
C201T were fully linked. No associations were identified between genotypes and patient age, sex, performance
status, or disease stage.
Genetic and Clinical Predictors of
Progression-Free Survival
Carriers of the mutant ERCC1 T allele had a lower PFS
compared with carriers of the wild-type ERCC1 CC genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval

Carriers of the wild-type ERCC1 CC genotype had a significantly higher response rate compared with carriers of
the T allele (52% vs 29%; P ¼ .02) (Table 2). Although
carriers of the wild-type XPD10 GG genotype had a lower

Genetic and Clinical Predictors of Overall
Survival
At the time of data analysis, 17 patients were still alive.
Carriers of the mutant ERCC1 T allele had a shorter OS
compared with carriers of the wild-type CC genotype (9.5
months vs 14.9 months; HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02-2.21; P

higher OS compared with carriers of the wild-type
XPD10 GG genotype (11.0 months vs 7.2 months; HR,
0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.85; P < .01). Patients with an

DISCUSSION
Clinical studies on predictive molecular markers in
patients with advanced NSCLC who receive platinumbased chemotherapy have focused mainly on tumor gene
or protein expression.18,19 Although some strong associations have been described for tumor expression of
ERCC120-22 and RRM123-25 and clinical outcome, to
date, these associations have not been implemented into
clinical decision making. One reason for this may be difficulty handling tumor material and the need for specialized
laboratories to analyze gene expression. A second reason
may be that often only small tumor samples are available
in patients with advanced NSCLC. In these cases, available tissue may not be adequate for tumor gene expression
profiling. Conversely, germline gene polymorphisms are
easy to measure, constant over time, and represent an ideal
tool for developing markers in patients with advanced
NSCLC. In the current study, the mutant ERCC1 T allele
was associated with a lower response to platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy and with lower PFS and OS rates. In
addition, the mutant XPD10 A allele was associated with
better response to treatment and with higher PFS and OS
rates, but the difference was significant only for OS.
Accordingly, stratifying patients for ERCC1 and eventually XPD10 may be of clinical interest when tumor shrinkage is important, such as in the neoadjuvant setting. For
toxicity, the mutant C alleles of both RECQ1 and CDA
Cancer

were associated with more frequent leukocytopenia and
the need for dose reductions; and, to our knowledge, this
has not been described previously. In a pharmacokinetic
subanalysis of 37 patients who were included in the same
study, we demonstrated that the CDA mutant C allele
(CDA*2) results in greater exposure to gemcitabine,
which subsequently may result in more severe leucozytopenia.26 In addition, the GSTP1 GG genotype was associated with severe polyneuropathy. Similar results have
been described for GSTP1 in patients with colorectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy,27 but not
in others.28,29 In the current study, 18% of carriers of the
GSTP1 GG genotype experienced severe platinum-associated peripheral polyneuropathy. If this is confirmed, then
these patients may be candidates for receiving carboplatin
instead of cisplatin to avoid severe polyneuropathy.
Eight major clinical trials have assessed ERCC1
mutations in patients with lung cancer. Ryu and colleagues studied 109 patients with advanced NSCLC who
received cisplatin-based chemotherapy and observed that
carriers of the ERCC1 CC genotype had an improved OS
compared with carriers of the CT or TT genotypes (486
days vs 281 days).6 Similarly, Isla and colleagues studied
62 patients with advanced NSCLC receiving docetaxelcisplatin chemotherapy, and found carriers of the ERCC1
CC genotype to have an improved OS.4 Kalikaki and colleagues assessed 119 patients with NSCLC who received

2473

Original Article

platinum-based chemotherapy.5 In that study, although
carriers of the ERCC1 C allele were more likely to respond
to chemotherapy, this did not translate into an improved
OS.5 No correlation between the ERCC1 genotype and
clinical outcome was observed in 4 other studies.7-10
Some studies specifically examined the impact of
ERCC1 mutations on treatment response in patients with
advanced NSCLC who received platinum-based chemotherapy.4-6,30-32 In the study by Li and colleagues, the T allele of ERCC1 was associated with improved treatment
response in 115 patients with advanced NSCLC who
received platinum-based chemotherapy, but the difference
was relatively small (50% response rate in carriers of the
CT genotype vs 43% in carriers of the CC genotype).32 In
the study by Kalikaki and colleagues, the ERCC1 C allele
was associated with improved response (34.7% vs 5.5% in
carriers of the homozygous mutant TT genotype).5 No
association was observed between the ERCC1 codon 118
polymorphism and treatment response in other studies.4,6
Recently, Horgan and colleagues pooled data from 90 trials
and identified no significant association between ERCC1
codon 118 mutations and OS in Caucasian patients with
lung cancer who received platinum chemotherapy; however, the T allele was a significant predictor of poor outcome in Asian patients who received cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.33 Potentially, differences or imbalances in
second-line or later treatment may have influenced the correlation between ERCC1 genotypes and OS in the various
studies. For example, carriers of the ERCC1 CC genotype
tended to have a better disease-free survival compared with
carriers of the CT or TT genotypes in the study by Takenaka and colleagues, but this did not translate into a better
OS.8 In the studies by Zhou et al10 and de las Penas et al,7
no information was available on the correlation between
ERCC1 genotypes, treatment response, and PFS.
In our study, carriers of the XRCC1 G allele had a
lower OS, similar to what was described by Giachino and
colleagues in 203 patients with NSCLC and 45 patients
with small cell lung cancer, although the difference was of
borderline statistical significance.12 This was confirmed
further in a study by Gurubhagavatula and colleagues,
who observed that the XRCC1 G allele was associated
with a worse OS in 103 patients with advanced NSCLC
who received platinum-based chemotherapy.11 In addition, those authors reported that a higher number of variant alleles within XPD codon 312 and XRCC1 codon 399
were associated with a lower OS.11 Two Asian studies did
not identify any association between XRCC1 polymorphisms and clinical outcome in patients with advanced

2474

NSCLC who received platinum-based chemotherapy.13,14 Overall, the data are consistent on the association
of the XRCC1 G allele with a worse clinical outcome in
patients with advanced NSCLC who receive platinumbased chemotherapy. Therefore, patients carrying the
XRCC1 mutant G allele may be good candidates for
receiving nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy. Two
clinical studies assessed the predictive value of the RRM1
promoter polymorphism in patients with advanced
NSCLC. The study by Kim and colleagues included 97
patients with advanced NSCLC who received platinumgemcitabine chemotherapy.31 The response rate to platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy was significantly higher
in carriers of the heterozygous mutant RRM1 AC genotype compared with carriers of the RRM1 wild-type allele
(65.5% vs 42.6%). Similar to our study, no such relation
was observed in a second study in which presence of the
RRM1 C37A mutant allele was determined in 62
patients with advanced NSCLC who received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.30
The strengths of our current study are its prospective
nature, the assessment of candidate genes with a strong
pathophysiologic association to the metabolism or the
mode of action of the anticancer drugs, and the variety of
clinical endpoints assessed. Limitations of the study
include the fact that tumor mutation status was not
assessed, and no genome-wide analytical approach was
chosen, potentially resulting in missing other yet
unknown genetic predictors for platinum-based chemotherapy in this group of patients. Furthermore, it remains
unclear whether the association of gene polymorphisms
with clinical outcome is predictive for patients who
receive platinum-based chemotherapy or prognostic for
patients with advanced NSCLC, because no patient group
without chemotherapy treatment was available for
comparison.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to date in patients with advanced NSCLC
describing predictive germline polymorphisms not only
for platinum-gemcitabine clinical activity (ERCC1,
XPD10) but also for toxicity (GSTP1, RECQ1, CDA).
Nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy in carriers of the
ERCC1 T allele or the XPD10 G allele should be studied
prospectively.
