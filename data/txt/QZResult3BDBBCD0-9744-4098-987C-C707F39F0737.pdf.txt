Abstract
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare B-cell lymphoma
caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).
PEL is poorly responsive to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy
and portends a poor survival. Consequently, new effective
treatment options are urgently needed. It is known that KSHV
encodes two lytic genes, ORF36 (phosphotransferase) and
KSHV ORF21 (thymidine kinase), which can phosphorylate
ganciclovir and azidothymidine, respectively. Here, we have
explored whether these genes can be used as therapeutic
targets for PEL. PEL arises in pleural spaces and other
effusions that provide a hypoxic environment. Based on
Northern blot analysis, exposure of PEL cells to hypoxia
up-regulated the expression of both ORF36 and ORF21. Using
a newly developed nonradioactive reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
method to separate and quantify the phosphorylated forms of
ganciclovir and azidothymidine, we found that PEL cells
exposed to hypoxia produced increased amounts of the toxic
triphosphates of these drugs. Moreover, we found that hypoxia
increased the cell toxicity of ganciclovir and azidothymidine in
PEL cells but had no significant effect on the herpesvirusnegative cell line CA46. These findings may have clinical applicability in the development of effective therapies for PEL or other
KSHV-related malignancies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):7003–10]

Introduction
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare B-cell lymphoma that
develops particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency
virus infection (1, 2). PEL characteristically arises in the pleural
space and other body cavities and is sometimes referred to as body
cavity lymphoma. Essentially all PEL tumors are infected with
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also called
human herpesvirus-8, and most cases of PEL are coinfected with
EBV (1–3). KSHV plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PEL
(3, 4), as well as Kaposi’s sarcoma and multicentric Castleman’s
disease (3, 5, 6). Although the incidence of these diseases has
decreased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral
therapy in the developed world, they have not been eliminated.
Moreover, KSHV-related malignancies are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa and other parts of the developing world
(7). There is currently no standard therapy for PEL. Although some

cases respond to multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy, the tumor is
often resistant to such approaches and most patients die within
months (8–10). Consequently, new therapies for PEL are urgently
needed.
In viral-induced tumors, viral genes are unique to the tumor cells
and thus offer potential targets for attack (11). Because most
herpesvirus-induced tumors have latently infected cells, such
approaches would generally require targeting latent genes or
inducing lytic replication. Although KSHV is in a latent state in
most cell lines derived from PEL tumors, some KSHV lytic genes
are activated in tumor cells in the body (12, 13) and there is
evidence that certain lytic genes play a key role in the pathogenesis
of PEL and other tumors (4, 14). Our group has found previously
that KSHV is activated to lytic replication by hypoxia (15); in
addition, we and others showed that certain lytic genes are
specifically activated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)–responsive
elements (HRE) in their promoter regions (15–18). Pleural and
other body cavity effusions are relatively hypoxic environments
(19, 20), and this may contribute to the lytic gene activation found
in PEL tumor cells. One gene that is activated directly by hypoxia
is ORF36 (16, 17). ORF36 has kinase activity (21), may be involved
in cell signaling, (22, 23), and has been reported to activate
ganciclovir to a toxic triphosphate moiety (24). Another KSHV lytic
gene, ORF21, encodes a thymidine kinase that can phosphorylate
zidovudine (azidothymidine) and to a variable extent ganciclovir
(24, 25). These observations suggested that these lytic genes might
be used as specific targets for PEL therapy.
Here, we report on the activation of these KSHV genes in PEL
lines by hypoxia, their phosphorylation of ganciclovir and
azidothymidine, and the enhanced phosphorylation of these drugs
in PEL lines exposed to hypoxia. In addition, we explore the
potential of using this type of targeting to develop a novel therapy
for PEL.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and other reagents. Ganciclovir from Roche Laboratories was
prepared (20 mmol/L) in PBS. Azidothymidine from Sigma and ganciclovir
triphosphate (GCVTP) from TriLink Biotechnologies were prepared
(10 mmol/L) in PBS and stored at 20jC. Azidothymidine triphosphate
(AZTTP) from Calbiochem was prepared (10 mmol/L) in PBS and stored at
70jC. Venom phosphodiesterase was obtained from Worthington
Biochemical Corp. Acetate kinase was obtained from Roche Applied
Sciences.
Synthesis of ganciclovir monophosphate, ganciclovir diphosphate,
azidothymidine monophosphate, and azidothymidine diphosphate.
Venom phosphodiesterase was used to synthesize ganciclovir monophosphate (GCVMP) from GCVTP (26). The reaction mixture consisted of
0.01 mol/L Tris-HCl, 0.01 mol/L MgCl2 (pH 9.0), 1 unit venom
phosphodiesterase, and 250 Amol/L GCVTP. The reaction proceeded for
6 h at 37jC and was inactivated by heating for 2 min at 95jC. Generation

of GCVMP was confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC/MS). Azidothymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) was synthesized using
the same method. Acetate kinase was used to specifically synthesize
ganciclovir diphosphate (GCVDP) from GCVTP (26). The reaction mixture
consisted of 0.01 mol/L Tris-HCl, 0.01 mol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mol/L ammonium
acetate (pH 8.0), 500 Ag/mL acetate kinase, and 250 Amol/L GCVTP. The
reaction proceeded for 6 h at 37jC and was heat inactivated at 95jC for
2 min. Generation of GCVDP was confirmed by LC/MS. Azidothymidine
diphosphate (AZTDP) was synthesized using the same method as that for
GCVDP.
Separation of phosphorylated forms of azidothymidine and
ganciclovir by reverse-phase high-performance LC. Ganciclovir nucleotides were separated on a Develosil RP-Aqueous 5-Am column (250 mm 
4.6 mm) from Phenomenex. The mobile phase was a 25 mmol/L ammonium
formate (pH 9.0) buffer/acetonitrile mixture. Ammonium formate (pH 9.0)
buffer was run from 0 to 7 min followed by a gradient from 0% to 70%
acetonitrile from 7 to 12 min and then another gradient from 70% to 95%
acetonitrile from 12 to 24 min followed by reequilibration to 0% acetonitrile
for the remaining time. GCVMP, GCVDP, and GCVTP were eluted at 14, 11.5,
and 10 min, respectively. A slightly modified method was used to separate
azidothymidine phosphorylated metabolites. The starting buffer was a
mixture of 98% ammonium formate buffer and 2% acetonitrile (percentage
acetonitrile optimized for each column using known standards) from 0 to
7 min followed by the same gradients described previously. AZTMP, AZTDP,
and AZTTP were eluted at 19.5, 17, and 11 min, respectively. The AZTTP
retention time shifted to 18 min in the presence of magnesium ions;
therefore, the concentrations of both forms were included when analyzing
cell extracts.
Cell lines. Except when indicated otherwise, BCBL-1 cells ( from the
NIAID AIDS Research and Reagent Program, Rockville, MD) and JSC-1 cells
(gift of Dr. Richard Ambinder, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD)
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with 10% heat-inactivated
FCS (Hyclone), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate,
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (other cell culture materials were from Life
Technologies). CA46 and 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection)
were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) with 10% heat-inactivated
FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate.
Determination of ganciclovir/azidothymidine cytotoxicity and
synergy. JSC-1 and BCBL-1 cells were seeded at 100,000 live cells/mL in
96-well plates (200 AL/well) and incubated for 24 h in normoxia. Cells were
treated with PBS, ganciclovir, or azidothymidine or with a combination of
the two drugs. Cells were then incubated for an additional 72 h in either
normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2). After 72 h, cell viability was assessed
using the Cell-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Luminescence was read by the Victor2 luminometer from Perkin-Elmer. To
determine if the combination of ganciclovir and azidothymidine resulted
in a synergistic toxic effect, dose-response curves were run using various
doses of ganciclovir and azidothymidine (10 Amol/L). Results were analyzed
using the CalcuSyn program (Biosoft).
Plasmid constructs and cell transfection with ORF21 and ORF36.
The coding sequences of ORF21 and ORF36 in tandem with the coding
sequence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) were PCR amplified from
BCBL-1 cellular DNA with primers containing Bgl11 and EcoR1 restriction
sites at the 5¶ and 3¶ ends, respectively. ORF21 was amplified with the primer
pairs 5¶-CAGagatctATGGCAGAAGGCGGTTTT-3¶ (ORF21F) and 5¶-ATAgaattcGACCCTGCATGTCTCCTC-3¶ (ORF21R) and ORF36 was amplified
with the primer pairs 5¶-CATagatctATGCGCTGGAAGAGAATG-3¶ (ORF36F)
and 5¶-ATAgaattcGAAAACAAGTCCGCGGGT-3¶ (ORF36R). The lower case
letters indicate Bgl11 and EcoR1 restriction sites, respectively. Amplified
products were digested with Bgl11 and EcoR1 and cloned into the same
restriction sites of the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to construct
pEGFP-36 and pEGFP-21. For transfection, 293T cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh medium. They were plated at 200,000
live cells/mL (2 mL/well) in 12-well plates and incubated overnight at 37jC
in normoxia. For each well, a transfection mixture was made containing
97 AL serum-free DMEM and 3 AL FuGene 6 transfection reagent from
Roche. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and 1 Ag

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

plasmid DNA encoding ORF21 or ORF36 was added. The mixture was again
incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then added dropwise to the
appropriate culture well. The cells were again incubated for 24 h and treated
with PBS, azidothymidine, ganciclovir, or azidothymidine plus ganciclovir.
The cells were cultured for 48 h and removed from the bottom of the plate
by vigorous mixing; cells and supernatant were transferred to a microfuge
tube and extracted as described.
Analysis of ganciclovir or azidothymidine phosphorylation in PEL
cells and uninfected B-cells. BCBL-1, JSC-1, and CA46 cells were prepared
at 200,000 live cells/mL and placed in 25-cm2 flasks (10 mL/flask). Cells
were incubated at 37jC in normoxia for 24 h before treatment with
azidothymidine and/or ganciclovir and then incubated for another 48 h
with drugs or control medium in either normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were
pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500  g for 10 min and then washed twice
with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 300 AL of 60% methanol and
heated for 2 min at 95j. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
10 min and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube and dried in a
Speedvac Plus from Thermo. The residue was resuspended in 25 AL of
25 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 9.0) immediately before injection, and
20 AL were injected onto the column. This method was also used on the
transfected 293T cells treated with azidothymidine and/or ganciclovir.
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. Total cellular RNA was
isolated from PEL cells cultured for 24 h under various conditions by using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot hybridization was done using a
nonisotopic digoxigenin labeling probe generated by PCR (Roche Applied
Sciences). Briefly, 5 Ag of total RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose gel
containing 2% formaldehyde and subsequently transferred to Hybond-N
nylon membranes (Amersham) in the presence of 20 SSC overnight by
capillary transfer. After fixing the RNA to the membrane by UV crosslinking, the membranes were prehybridized for 30 min and hybridized with
DIG Easy Hyb buffer (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 50jC with fulllength digoxigenin-labeled gene-specific DNA probes incorporated by PCR.
The membranes were washed, incubated for 30 min with an appropriate
dilution of anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase,
washed again, incubated with CDP-Star solution (Roche Applied Sciences)
for 5 min, and exposed to film with an intensifying screen. Membranes were
stripped (50% formamide, 2 saline-sodium phosphate-EDTA) at 65jC for
1 h and then rehybridized with h-actin probe generated from KSHV cDNA
as a loading control.
Analysis of KSHV by Western blot. JSC-1 cells were plated at 250,000
cells per mL, incubated overnight, treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA; 5 nmol/L), TPA plus ganciclovir (100 Amol/L), or TPA plus
ganciclovir (100 Amol/L) and azidothymidine (50 Amol/L), and incubated in
normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h. Cells were centrifuged (10 min at 1,500  g at
4jC) and the resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 75,000 rpm for
45 min at 4jC. The pellet was washed with 5 mL PBS and pelleted again by
ultracentrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in lithium dodecyl sulfate
sample buffer (Novex) and boiled at 95jC for 2 min. Equal volumes of
the resuspended pellet were electrophoresed on a 4% to 12% bis-Tris
polyacrylamide gel with MOPS buffer by means of the Nupage system
(Novex). Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and
blocked in 5% dried milk/TBS with 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h at room
temperature. After blocking, the membrane was probed with a monoclonal
antibody (mAb) to ORF45 (gift of Dr. Yan Yuan, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA) for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated for
30 min with an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline
phosphatase. Bands were detected with Western Blue–stabilized alkaline
phosphatase substrate (Promega).
Assessment of interactions between ganciclovir and azidothymidine. To determine the potential interaction of azidothymidine and
ganciclovir in PEL cells, toxicity dose response curves were assessed for
each drug alone to obtain the median effect dose (D m) and the sigmoidicity
of the dose-effect curve (m). In addition, the effect of ganciclovir in
combination with azidothymidine was assessed. Analysis of the data was
done using CalcuSyn (Biosoft) to determine the combination index (CI), a
measure of synergy or antagonism between two drugs. A CI of 1 indicates no
synergy, a CI of >1 indicates antagonism, and a CI of <1 indicates synergy.

KSHV Phosphorylation of Azidothymidine and Ganciclovir

Results
Activation of KSHV ORF21 and ORF36 by hypoxia. We first
explored the up-regulation by hypoxia of ORF21 and ORF36
(24, 25). Our group showed previously that KSHV is activated to
lytic replication by hypoxia (15) and that ORF36 is in a cluster of
genes that is specifically up-regulated by hypoxia through an HRE
in the promoter region (16, 17). As shown in Fig. 1, Northern blot
analysis revealed that both ORF21 and ORF36 mRNA were upregulated when JSC-1 cells were exposed to hypoxia. ORF36 was
detectable within 8 h after exposure to hypoxia but was more
strongly induced at 24 h and reached levels similar to those obtained
with the chemical inducer butyrate. ORF21 mRNA was undetectable
8 h after exposure to either hypoxia or butyrate. However, ORF21
mRNA was detectable 24 h after exposure to either hypoxia or
butyrate at approximately equal levels, although the bands were
fainter than those for ORF36 (Fig. 1). Thus, ORF21 and ORF36 are
both up-regulated when cells are exposed to hypoxia, although
the induction of ORF21 is less robust and somewhat delayed.
Phosphorylation of azidothymidine and ganciclovir by
ORF21- and ORF36-transfected cells. To assess the ability of
cells expressing ORF21 and/or ORF36 gene products to phosphorylate azidothymidine or ganciclovir, we first developed a nonradioactive reverse-phase high-performance LC/MS (RP-HPLC/MS)
method for separating and identifying their phosphorylated
products. Using this technique, the phosphorylated forms of
ganciclovir and azidothymidine could be separated and identified
based on elution time coupled with detection of target masses by
selective ion monitoring (Fig. 2A and B). Dose response curves
(1–100 pmol AZTTP) confirmed a strong linear correlation between
the concentration of nucleotides injected and the mass signal
obtained (linear correlation coefficient 0.999 for 0–100 pmol
AZTTP and 0.998 for 0–100 pmol GCVTP).
RP-HPLC/MS was used to assess the ability of cells transfected
with ORF21 or ORF36 to phosphorylate azidothymidine and
ganciclovir. Cells (293T) were transfected with plasmids containing
GFP-tagged ORF21, GFP-tagged ORF36, or a vector control and
incubated for 48 h with 25 Amol/L azidothymidine or 500 Amol/L

Figure 2. Representative RP-HPLC chromatograms showing the separation of
the phosphorylated forms of ganciclovir (A ) and azidothymidine (B ) and
phosphorylation of ganciclovir and azidothymidine by 293T cells transfected with
KSHV ORF21 (C ) or ORF36 (D ). The compounds (10 AL of a 10 Amol/L solution)
were separated on a Develosil RP-Aqueous column as described in Materials
and Methods. A, GCVMP, GCVDP, and GCVTP eluted at 13.5, 10.5, and
10 min, respectively. B, AZTMP, AZTDP, AZTTP eluted at 19.5, 12.5, and
9.5 min, respectively. The target masses used in negative ionization mode for
GCVMP, GCVDP, and GCVTP were 334, 414, and 494, respectively, and for
AZTMP, AZTDP, and AZTTP were 346, 426, and 506, respectively. Note that the
ratio between peak area and amount is specific for each compound due to
differences in ionization potential of each compound. C, 293T cells were
transfected with an empty vector-GFP plasmid, ORF21-GFP plasmid,
or ORF36-GFP plasmid. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 h with
500 Amol/L ganciclovir or 25 Amol/L azidothymidine (D ). They were then
extracted and analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Data are
representative result from at least three experiments with similar outcomes.

extracted, and 5 Ag of total cellular RNA were loaded per lane on a 0.9%
agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized to
digoxigenin-labeled full-length probes for ORF36 (A), ORF21 (B ), or h-actin,
used as the loading control (C ).

ganciclovir. Cells were extracted and analyzed by RP-HPLC/MS.
For cells exposed to ganciclovir, the most abundant phosphorylated form was, in all cases, GCVTP (Fig. 2C). ORF21- and ORF36transfected cells were both capable of producing greater levels of

all the metabolites of ganciclovir than the vector-transfected cells
(Fig. 2C). Interestingly, ORF36-transfected cells generated 2.5-fold
more GCVTP (76 pmol/million cells) than the ORF21-transfected
cells, although they produced similar levels of the monophosphate
and diphosphate (Fig. 2C).
Consistent with previous studies on uninfected cells treated with
azidothymidine (27), the most abundant phosphorylated form of
azidothymidine produced in 293T cells transfected with a control
vector plasmid and treated with 25 Amol/L azidothymidine was
AZTMP (Fig. 2D). However, when cells were transfected with
ORF21, the concentrations of AZTDP and AZTTP increased
substantially and accumulated to substantially higher levels than
the monophosphate (Fig. 2D). The most abundant form of
azidothymidine identified in ORF21-transfected 293T cells was
AZTTP. These cells produced 437 pmol/million cells of AZTTP
compared with a much lower level for vector-transfected cells
(2.9 pmol/million cells; Fig. 2D). Interestingly, ORF36-transfected
cells did not produce greater amounts of either AZTDP or AZTTP
than the vector-treated cells, indicating that azidothymidine is a
poor substrate for this enzyme under these conditions (Fig. 2D).
These results indicate that KSHV ORF21 can phosphorylate
azidothymidine and to a lesser extent ganciclovir, whereas ORF36
is only able to phosphorylate ganciclovir efficiently.
Phosphorylation of azidothymidine and ganciclovir in PEL
cells exposed to hypoxia. As noted above, hypoxia up-regulates
the expression of ORF21 and ORF36. With this background, we
hypothesized that the phosphorylation of ganciclovir and azidothymidine would be increased when PEL cells were exposed to
hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed JSC-1 cells to TPA or
hypoxia, treated them with ganciclovir or azidothymidine for 48 h,
and analyzed cell extracts by RP-HPLC/MS. KSHV-uninfected CA46
cells were used as a control. In normoxia, JSC-1 cells produced low
levels of GCVDP and GCVTP (5 and 18 pmol/million cells,
respectively) and no detectable GCVMP (<1 pmol/million cells;
Fig. 3A). However, when JSC-1 cells were exposed to hypoxia,
GCVDP and GCVTP increased by f3-fold to 13.4 and 51.2 pmol/
million cells, respectively. In addition, GCVMP was now detectable
at a level of 7.7 pmol/million cells. These increases were comparable with those observed when the cells were exposed to 10 nmol/L
TPA (2.7-fold increase in GCVDP and 3.9-fold increase in GCVTP;
Fig. 3A). By contrast, in CA46 cells, all three metabolites of
ganciclovir were detected at low levels but there were no significant
increases following exposure to TPA or hypoxia (Fig. 3A).
When CA46 or JSC-1 cells were treated with 25 Amol/L
azidothymidine, the most abundant phosphorylated form detected
was, as expected, AZTMP (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, whereas CA46
cells produced very low levels of the toxic triphosphate, AZTTP,
(<1 pmol/million cells under all conditions), even normoxic JSC-1
cells produced measurable quantities of AZTTP (7 pmol/million cells;
Fig. 3B). The levels of AZTTP further increased when JSC-1 cells
were exposed to hypoxia (12 pmol/million cells) or TPA
(21 pmol/million cells; Fig. 3B). Thus, exposure of JSC-1 cells to
hypoxia resulted in increased production of both GCVTP and
AZTTP compared with cells cultured in normoxia or CA46 cells
exposed to hypoxia.
Ganciclovir and azidothymidine are toxic to PEL cells and
this effect is enhanced when the cells are exposed to hypoxia.
The cytotoxic effects of azidothymidine, ganciclovir, and their
combination were examined in PEL cell lines incubated in
normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were exposed to various concentrations
of the drugs for 72 h and percentage viability was assessed by the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

ATP luminescence assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, the 50% cytotoxic
concentration (CC50) of ganciclovir in JSC-1 cells was f250 Amol/L
but the CC50 decreased to f150 Amol/L when cells were incubated
in hypoxia. For BCBL-1 cells, the CC50 of ganciclovir in normoxia
was f430 Amol/L (Fig. 4B). Again, in hypoxia, the toxicity of
ganciclovir was increased at each concentration tested, and the
CC50 decreased to f300 Amol/L. By contrast, ganciclovir had
relatively little toxicity in CA46 cells at concentrations of up to
500 Amol/L in either normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 4C).
Because the phosphorylation of both ganciclovir and azidothymidine were increased in KSHV-infected cells by hypoxia, we
examined their interaction in inducing toxicity. Azidothymidine
alone (10 Amol/L) induced little or no toxicity in PEL cells in
normoxia and also induced only a low level of toxicity in hypoxia
(20% killing of JSC-1 cells and 5% of BCBL-1 cells). However,
10 Amol/L azidothymidine did increase the toxicity of ganciclovir
in JSC-1 cells shifting the CC50 from f250 Amol/L ganciclovir to
150 Amol/L ganciclovir in the presence of azidothymidine (Fig. 5A).

Figure 3. Hypoxia enhances phosphorylation of ganciclovir and azidothymidine
in KSHV-infected cells. KSHV-infected PEL cells (JSC-1) and uninfected
Burkitt’s lymphoma B cells (CA46) were plated at 200,000 live cells/mL. After
24 h in normoxia, the cells were treated with 500 Amol/L ganciclovir (A) or
25 Amol/L azidothymidine (B ) and incubated in normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h.
Cells were then extracted and the concentrations of the phosphorylated
metabolites of ganciclovir and azidothymidine were determined by RP-HPLC/MS
analysis. Cells exposed to 10 nmol/L TPA and treated with 500 Amol/L
ganciclovir or 25 Amol/L azidothymidine in normoxia were used as positive
controls (TPA controls). B, concentration of AZTMP (Y1 axis ) and concentration
of AZTDP and AZTTP (Y2 axis ). Data for ganciclovir in JSC-1 cells are
representative of three experiments, data for azidothymidine in JSC-1 cells are
representative of two experiments (similar results were obtained when 50 Amol/L
azidothymidine was used), and data from CA46 cells are representative of
two experiments.

and then incubated under the same conditions for 72 h. Cell viability was then determined using the ATP viability assay and the relative live cell number was calculated
against the PBS controls in normoxia or hypoxia. Points, average of treatments done in triplicate; bars, SD. Note that in the hypoxia controls, the relative live cell
number decreased by 31%, 46%, and 28% for JSC-1, BCBL-1, and CA46, respectively, compared with the normoxia controls.

Moreover, when the JSC-1 cells were cultured under conditions of
hypoxia, 10 Amol/L azidothymidine increased the toxicity further
with a CC50 of 50 Amol/L for ganciclovir (Fig. 4A). Again, similar
results were seen in BCBL-1 cells. In normoxia, the addition of
10 Amol/L azidothymidine decreased the CC50 of ganciclovir from
f430 to f350 Amol/L. In addition, in the presence of 10 Amol/L
azidothymidine, exposure of BCBL-1 cells to hypoxia substantially
increased the toxicity of ganciclovir with a CC50 of f175 Amol/L
(Fig. 4B). By contrast to the results with these PEL cell lines, the
combination of 10 Amol/L azidothymidine and up to 500 Amol/L
ganciclovir induced little toxicity in CA46 cells when cultured in
either normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 4C). Analysis of JSC-1 cells by
Annexin V staining as described previously (28) showed that the
increased killing by ganciclovir in hypoxia was due to apoptotic cell
death. After 48 h in hypoxia, 33% of the cells were apoptotic and
this increased to 49% with exposure to 100 Amol/L ganciclovir
(data not shown).
To assess whether ganciclovir and azidothymidine were
synergistic, antagonistic, or additive in their toxicity to PEL cells,
further experiments were done and the results were analyzed using
CalcuSyn to determine the extent of synergy. In normoxia, synergy
was only observed at the two highest drug concentrations
when ganciclovir and azidothymidine were tested at a ratio of
10:1. (Table 1). However, in hypoxia, the two drugs were synergistic
at all concentrations tested with the CI ranging from 0.29 to 0.74,
consistent with the hypoxic activation of increased phosphorylation of these drugs. Synergy between the two drugs was also
observed in JSC-1 cells in normoxia and hypoxia with all but the
lowest dose of ganciclovir (25 Amol/L) when a constant dose of
azidothymidine (10 Amol/L) was used (CI range, 0.1–0.7; data not
shown). Overall, the results indicate that cells infected with KSHV
are more sensitive to ganciclovir and azidothymidine than
uninfected cells, that hypoxia can further sensitize the infected

cells to killing by these drugs, and that the two drugs are synergistic
in their effects under conditions of hypoxia.
Ganciclovir and ganciclovir/azidothymidine inhibit KSHV
production from JSC-1 cells. Lytic activation of PEL cells leads
to virus production and eventual cell lysis (29). To determine if
ganciclovir or ganciclovir/azidothymidine treatment resulted in
the inhibition of virus production, we analyzed the production of
virus in the supernatant of JSC-1 cells following treatment with
TPA or hypoxia in the presence or absence of ganciclovir
(100 Amol/L) or ganciclovir (100 Amol/L) plus azidothymidine
(50 Amol/L). Virus in pelleted supernatant was assessed using a
mAb to ORF45 protein, a protein contained within KSHV particles
(30). In the absence of TPA or hypoxia, only a very low level of virus

Figure 5. Ganciclovir (GCV ) and azidothymidine (AZT ) treatment of JSC-1 cells
inhibits the accumulation of virus induced by hypoxia or TPA. JSC-1 cells
(250,000 cells/mL) were plated and incubated for 24 h in normoxia and then
cultured for 48 h under conditions of normoxia, hypoxia, or in normoxia after
stimulation with TPA (5 nmol/L). During the culture period, the cells were
exposed to ganciclovir (100 Amol/L); ganciclovir (100 Amol/L) and azidothymidine
(50 Amol/L); or PBS. After 48 h, the cells were removed by centrifugation and
the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 75,000 rpm to obtain viral pellets.
The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western
blot using an antibody to the ORF45 gene product (ProMab and initially
provided as a kind gift from Dr. Yan Yuan). The ORF45 KSHV gene product
is a protein contained within viral particles.

production from JSC-1 cells was detected, and this was inhibited by
ganciclovir (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). Exposure of cells to hypoxia led
to an increase in virus production that was inhibited by ganciclovir
or ganciclovir/azidothymidine (Fig. 5, lanes 3–5). Exposure of
cells to TPA in normoxia led to strong induction of virus that
was again substantially inhibited by ganciclovir or ganciclovir/
azidothymidine (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8). Thus, under conditions of
hypoxia, ganciclovir and ganciclovir/azidothymidine could simultaneously inhibit KSHV virus production while still resulting in
substantial toxicity to PEL cells.

Discussion
It was shown previously that transfection of KSHV ORF21 or
ORF36 into cells could result in increased phosphorylation of
azidothymidine or ganciclovir, respectively (24, 25). In this report,
we confirmed these findings using a novel nonradioactive RPHPLC/MS method and explored the possibility of using these viral
genes to specifically kill PEL cells. We showed that expression of
ORF21 and ORF36 mRNA was increased in PEL cells exposed to
hypoxia, that such cells have increased production of the toxic
moieties of azidothymidine and ganciclovir, and that exposure of
PEL cells to azidothymidine and ganciclovir in the presence of
hypoxia resulted in increased killing of cells.
The RP-HPLC/MS methodology used here enabled us to
simultaneously examine the monophosphate, diphosphate, and
triphosphate products of azidothymidine and ganciclovir. In
control 293T cells exposed to azidothymidine, the most abundant
form was AZTMP. This is consistent with previous reports of
azidothymidine metabolism and occurs because AZTMP is a poor
substrate for thymidylate kinase, the cellular enzyme responsible
for phosphorylation to the diphosphate (27). By contrast, transfection of ORF21 changed the relative production of the monophosphate and triphosphate moieties, resulting in a relative
increase in AZTTP. ORF21 can catalyze the formation of both
the monophosphate and the diphosphate of azidothymidine (25),
suggesting that the increased levels of AZTTP observed results
from a direct production of AZTDP by ORF21 and subsequent
phosphorylation to AZTTP by cellular enzymes. Although AZTTP
has a degree of specificity for reverse transcriptase, it can also
inhibit DNA polymerase, in particular DNA polymerase g (31, 32),

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

and this indicated that azidothymidine might selectively kill or
suppress the growth of KSHV-infected cells exposed to hypoxia.
GCVTP is also toxic and can kill tumor cells (33, 34). It is worth
pointing out that in the current study, we found that ganciclovir is
phosphorylated by ORF21 in addition to being phosphorylated by
ORF36. This is somewhat at variance with the finding of Gustafson
et al. (25) using purified enzyme; however, it is consistent with
the analysis of Cannon et al. (24) using tritiated ganciclovir in
transfected cells and may indicate that certain cellular factors play
a role in supporting the ORF21 phosphorylation of ganciclovir.
In this study, the ganciclovir CC50 in BCBL-1 cells was consistent
with previous reports (35, 36). Although a previous study did not
show ganciclovir toxicity when BCBL-1 cells were activated with TPA
(36), we found that the toxicity of ganciclovir was enhanced by
hypoxia or with the addition of 10 Amol/L azidothymidine, thereby
shifting the CC50 toward the IC50 for KSHV (35). Half of the JSC-1
cells in hypoxia were killed in the presence of 50 Amol/L ganciclovir
and 10 Amol/L azidothymidine. Moreover, under most, but not
all, conditions tested, there was synergy between ganciclovir and
azidothymidine. Although it was possible that the synergy observed
with azidothymidine was due to an induction of KSHV gene
expression by azidothymidine like that reported with EBV (37),
the concentrations of azidothymidine we used did not induce RTA
in PEL cells (data not shown).
There has been an interest in using vectors encoding herpes
simplex thymidine kinase in combination with ganciclovir or other
nucleoside therapy as experimental tumor therapy (33, 34). Several
groups have shown that KSHV replication is sensitive to treatment
with nucleoside analogues (38–40). As essentially all PEL cells are
infected with KSHV, viral thymidine kinase (ORF21) and phosphotransferase (ORF36) potentially represent built-in gene targets for
selective therapy. ORF36 is particularly of interest, as it can be
directly induced by hypoxia through a HRE in the promoter region
of the ORF34 to ORF37 viral gene cluster, potentially bypassing the
need for lytic activation through the Rta lytic switch (17). Because
PEL cells grow in a hypoxic environment, the potential for direct
ORF36 expression exists. The experiments here provide evidence to
support the use of azidothymidine and ganciclovir in the setting of
hypoxia. They also suggest that azidothymidine and ganciclovir
might be useful in combination to treat MCD, as a high percentage
of these tumor cells have KSHV lytic gene activation (12, 13).
Two main concerns arise when considering the use of these
antiviral drugs for the treatment of PEL or MCD. First, can a high
enough level of these drugs be obtained in patients and, second,
would the extent of killing obtained then be sufficient? The effective
concentrations of ganciclovir (50–150 Amol/L) and azidothymidine
(10–50 Amol/L) in this study are substantially higher than those
attained with the usual clinical doses of these drugs. However, during
short-term dosing, ganciclovir serum levels of 50 Amol/L or higher
can be attained (41). In addition, although serum levels of f2.5 to
3.5 Amol/L azidothymidine are attained with the usual p.o. dose of
250 mg (42), substantially higher serum levels (9–15 Amol/L) can be
attained and tolerated over a short period (42, 43). Additionally, it
may be possible to attain locally higher levels of the drugs through
direct delivery to the body cavities involved with PEL.
On the issue of the degree of killing, the data here suggest that
the drugs will preferentially kill those cells in which there is either
complete lytic activation or activation of ORF36 (or ORF21), as
occurs in the presence of hypoxia. PEL tumors grow in a hypoxia
environment (19, 20), and as a result, there can be direct activation
of ORF36. Although only a small percentage of PEL tumor cells may

be undergoing lytic activation, there is evidence of expression of
certain lytic genes, such as viral IL-6, by a relatively greater
percentage of these cells (12, 13). Moreover, there is evidence that
certain lytic genes of KSHV, such as viral IL-6, or cellular factors
that are up-regulated by KSHV lytic genes promote PEL pathogenesis through a paracrine mechanism (4, 14). Thus, a substantial
antitumor effect may possibly be gained by selectively killing the
PEL cells that express these lytic genes. The finding by Ghosh et al.
(44) of a long-lasting remission in a patient with PEL induced
by the combination of twice-daily parenteral azidothymidine
(1.5 gm/dose) and daily dosing with 5 million units IFN-a supports
the potential clinical utility of this approach.
The use of azidothymidine and ganciclovir in PEL could be
combined with other approaches (45) that can enhance KSHV
kinase expression or kill the cells through other mechanisms
(44, 46). It may also be possible to increase HIF in PEL cells through
the use of hypoxia-mimics like desferrioxamine (15). In addition,
various agents, such as bortezomib and valproic acid, have been
shown to activate the KSHV lytic cycle. For bortezomib, cell killing
was enhanced by coculture with ganciclovir (47, 48). Finally, the

feasibility of the approach described here is bolstered by reports
that patients with EBV-associated Burkitt lymphoma or central
nervous system lymphoma can be effectively treated with
azidothymidine-based therapy (37, 49, 50).
Viruses that cause tumors may provide specific virus-encoded
targets that can be used to develop specific therapies. In this
article, we have provided evidence that activation of KSHVencoded kinases by hypoxia might be used as a means to
specifically target PEL cells by drugs activated by the kinases.
Such an approach may be worth exploring in this usually fatal
disease.
