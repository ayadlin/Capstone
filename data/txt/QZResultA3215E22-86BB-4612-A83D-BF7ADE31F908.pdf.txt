BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that may develop in
patients with cancer who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The risk of mortality from FN is not well characterized in current clinical practice. METHODS: Patients with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy in clinical practice were identified from a large US healthcare claims database, and mortality was confirmed using the National
Death Index. Patients with FN had their propensity scores matched within tumor types of interest (non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers) to patients who did not experience FN. Study endpoints of
overall mortality (anytime during follow-up), early mortality (during the first 12 months of the first chemotherapy
course), and hospitalization were examined using univariate and multivariate techniques. RESULTS: Matched FN and
control groups each included 5990 patients, and the average follow-up for both groups was 17.6 months. Crude incidence rates of early mortality were significantly higher for patients with FN compared with controls for all tumor
types. Proportional hazards regression demonstrated a significant increase in the risk of overall and early mortality in
patients with FN compared with controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.29] and HR, 1.35
[95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.67], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The adjusted risk of mortality in patients who
experienced FN was at least 15% higher than in comparably matched patients without FN, supporting the inference
that infectious complications because of neutropenia resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy are clinically

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common but potentially serious complication in patients with cancer who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy.1-3
FN and Early Mortality
The risk of FN varies directly with the severity and duration of neutropenia and reportedly occurs most frequently early
during the course of chemotherapy.4-6 Major risk factors for the development of FN include older age, comorbid conditions, the type of cancer, and the type and number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy agents used.5-7 FN represents a lifethreatening complication that requires urgent evaluation for the identification and treatment of documented or presumed
infection.8 Infection in the neutropenic cancer patient often can be difficult to identify because of the lack of neutrophils
and associated clinical symptoms and signs. The febrile response also can be blunted in some immunosuppressed cancer
patients because of reduced circulating leukocytes producing interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor
alpha.3,8-10 FN is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with estimates of 6.8% to 20% mortality among
patients who are hospitalized for FN-related complications and with higher rates observed in patients who have major
comorbidities and documented sepsis or shock.2,10-12
FN and Late Mortality
Despite successful management, FN may have an equally important impact on the overall chemotherapy treatment plan,
resulting in dose reductions, treatment delays, chemotherapy discontinuation, or a switch to alternative, less toxic, or potentially
less effective regimens.11,13 Myelosuppression continues to represent the major cause of reduced chemotherapy dose intensity.13

Original Article

In vivo animal studies have demonstrated that relatively
small decreases in dose can cut cure rates by 50% or more.14
Several retrospective and prospective randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) support the importance of chemotherapy dose
intensity in achieving optimal clinical outcomes, including
long-term disease-free and overall survival.15-21
The major strategies for decreasing the risk of FN
and its complications include chemotherapy dose reductions and delays, the prophylactic use of a myeloid growth
factor, and the selective prophylactic use of antimicrobial
agents. A recent meta-analysis of 17 RCTs demonstrated
a significant reduction in FN and in infection-related and
early all-cause mortality with primary granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis.22
FN and Hospitalization
FN is treated as a serious and life-threatening condition
for which the standard of care for most patients includes
hospitalization for further evaluation and empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.8,12 The mean
length of stay for hospitalized patients with FN ranges
from 3 days to 15 days, and the mean hospitalization cost
per FN episode is $19,110, representing a significant burden on the healthcare system.2,23 Increasingly, low-risk
patients are being considered for outpatient management
of their FN. Careful patient selection and appropriate
supportive care are necessary to safely and effectively
implement an outpatient FN management system.24
To our knowledge, no study using a large private insurer health plan database has examined the impact of FN
on early and overall mortality. In this analysis, we
explored the current impact of FN on early and overall
mortality as well as hospitalization in a large managed
health plan database.

Database, Wilmington, Del). Claims data included both
inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (in International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] format) and procedures (in Current
Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition [CPT-4] and
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System formats)
as well as both standard and mail-order prescription
records from the National Drug Code directory. Dates of
service for all claims, additional patient demographic variables (eg, age, sex, geographic region), and types of healthcare coverage were available.
Mortality information was examined by linking
each patient to the NDI using at least 2 items of unique
private patient identifying information (eg, full name,
Social Security number). Mortality data were accessed in a
manner that complied with federal and state laws and regulations, including those related to privacy and security of
individually identifiable health information pursuant to
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was
obtained through a central IRB (Quorum Review IRB) to
access the NDI.
Selection of Participants
Source population creation

We identified all patients aged 18 years who had at
least 1 diagnosis for a malignant neoplasm (ICD-9-CM
code range 140.0-208.9) on or before the first chemotherapy claim that occurred between January 1, 2001, and
December 31, 2006. The index date was defined as the first
claim date for administration of a chemotherapeutic agent
preceded by 6 months without any chemotherapy claims.
Patients were excluded from the source population
if they 1) had claims indicating admission to a skilled
nursing inpatient facility or hospice on or before the index
date, 2) had a claim for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 3) had 1 or more chemotherapy courses that could
not be classified (ie, specific chemotherapy agent could
not be determined), or 4) were not continuously eligible
in the managed care plan during the 6-month period preceding the first chemotherapy claim date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For this retrospective cohort study, we used data from a
group of managed care payers that were linked to the
National Death Index (NDI). Unique cancer patients
with and without FN were identified to generate comparative estimates of the risk of hospitalization and mortality
overall and by tumor type.

Study cohort creation

Data Source
Data were obtained for this analysis from a large, geographically diverse US medical claims database from a
group of 12 managed care plans with more than 20 million unique patients (HealthCore Integrated Research

Patients who were identified with the following
malignancies were eligible for inclusion: non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) and cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum, and ovary. Patients were classified as having a neutropenic event (ie, FN) using the following principal
study definition: either a primary or secondary diagnosis

code for neutropenia (ICD-9-CM code 288.0) or a diagnosis code for infection (bacterial or fungal) during the
first chemotherapy course. By using both the primary and
secondary diagnoses for the receipt of care for an infection, a greater proportion of those truly diagnosed with
FN were identified.2
We used propensity score matching to maximize
comparability between the study groups. Within each tumor type of interest, we used logistic regression to compute the propensity to develop FN according to preindex
data from all available variables that were predictive of FN
(Table 1). Once each patient was assigned a propensity
score, we matched FN patients with and without FN
using nearest neighbor matching (1:1 with a caliper of
25% standard deviation25) of the propensity score without replacement. For analyses regarding the overall
cohort, we pooled over tumor type, creating 1 group of
FN patients and 1 group of non-FN patients.
For the outcome of overall mortality, patients were
followed until death, disenrollment from the health plan,
or study end (December 31, 2006); thus, patients potentially were followed across 1 or more courses of therapy for
this outcome. For the outcome of early mortality, patients
were followed until death, the end of the first chemotherapy course (truncated at 12 months), or disenrollment
from the health plan. For the outcome of hospitalization,
patients were followed until inpatient admission, the end of
the first chemotherapy course (truncated at 12 months), or
disenrollment from the health plan.
Study Variables
We used the period of 6 months before the initiation of
chemotherapy to identify preindex characteristics (age,
sex, region of the United States), comorbidities, and
selected risk factors (history of infection, history of hospitalization, history of surgery, and receipt of radiation therapy;
CPT codes 77401-77421). Comorbidities incorporated
the major risk factors for developing FN from clinical practice guidelines and included kidney disease, connective tissue disease, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
the Charlson comorbidity index.26,27 The use of G-CSF as
primary prophylaxis, which we defined as administration
of G-CSF within 5 days after the first day of the first cycle
of chemotherapy in the first course, was examined
dichotomously.
Chemotherapy
A chemotherapy course was defined as 1 or more repetitive cycles of treatment with the same chemotherapy.

Cancer

Chemotherapy type was defined dichotomously as highly
myelosuppressive or not based on the number of myelosuppressive drugs received during a chemotherapy cycle/
course (2 drugs vs >2 drugs) consistent with National
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.27 Drugs that
were considered myelosuppressive were based on previously published work.28
Endpoints
The primary outcome of this study was overall mortality,
which was defined as all-cause mortality during study follow-up. Early mortality was defined as all-cause mortality
that occurred during the first chemotherapy course (truncated at 12 months). To identify deaths, patient records
were matched to the death file contained in the NDI dataset. NDI information included cause of death (ICD-10)
as provided by the state vital statistics offices. All-cause
hospitalization after an FN event and during the first
chemotherapy course (truncated at 12 months) was identified using administrative claims. A total of 39 patients
were excluded from the hospitalization outcome analyses
as these patients did not experience their FN event within
the first 12 months of the first chemotherapy course.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the adequacy of the propensity score matching both within specific tumor types and for the combined overall cohort.
Comparisons of these variables between patients with FN
and their matched controls were made using chi-square
tests for categorical variables and 2-sample WilcoxonMann-Whitney tests for continuous variables.
To adjust for differences in the length of follow-up
between groups, person-time in the denominator of incidence rates was computed separately for each outcome
(hospitalization or mortality) in months from the index
date to the first occurrence of the relevant outcome (hospitalization or mortality), disenrollment, or study end.
Unadjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-months with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all study endpoints
were calculated. Mortality incidence rates for a subgroup
of FN patients who had inpatient admissions that met the
definition for FN were also calculated.
Cox regression models were used to examine the
hazard for hospitalization, overall mortality, and early
mortality. A saturated model with all covariates was created from which variables of a priori interest (eg, age, sex,
geographic region, tumor types) and variables that demonstrated significance at the a Â¼ .05 level were chosen for

inclusion in the final multivariate analyses. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested based on Schoenfeld residuals. Violation of the proportional hazards
assumption (P < .05) indicated that the covariate had a
time-varying effect on outcomes. Therefore, such variables were specified as time-varying covariates in the Cox
models.

RESULTS
The source population contained 27,979 patients aged
18 years who had at least 1 diagnosis for a malignant
neoplasm on or before the first chemotherapy claim date.
Forty-one percent of patients with tumor types of interest
were classified with FN; 5990 FN patients and 5990 nonFN patients were selected by propensity score matching
within tumor type for the study cohort (see Fig. 1). Postmatching comparison of the FN groups versus the control
groups within each tumor type demonstrated good balance between the groups (Table 1). In univariate analysis,
primary prophylaxis with G-CSF was received with
greater frequency by the patients with FN (P < .001).
Crude Incidence Measures
The incidence of overall mortality, early mortality, and
hospitalization by FN occurrence is listed in Table 2.
Overall mortality was only significantly higher in FN
patients compared with controls among those with NHL
(Table 2). Rates of overall mortality for all tumor types
trended higher in the FN group than in controls, although
the trend was not significant (Fig. 2). Early mortality incidence rates were significantly higher in patients with FN
compared with controls (Table 2, Fig. 3). The highest
early mortality rates were associated with lung cancer, and
the lowest rates were associated with breast cancer (Table
2). In all strata, the incidence of all-cause hospitalization
was significantly greater for patients with FN versus controls. Hospitalization rates were highest for patients with
lung cancer and lowest for patients with breast cancer.
Multivariate Analysis
The occurrence of FN in the Cox regression analysis was a
significant predictor of overall mortality when controlling
for all other variables in the model and was associated
with a 15% greater relative risk of dying (Table 3). Consistent with crude incidence, patients who had lung cancer
had the greatest hazard for overall mortality (hazard ratio
[HR], 5.26; 95% CI, 4.42-6.26) compared with patients
who had breast cancer. Geographic region was associated

with a significant difference: Patients in the East had the
lowest hazard. Use of prophylactic G-CSF significantly
decreased the hazard of overall mortality by 35%.
The occurrence of FN was associated with a significant 35% increase in the hazard of early mortality in the
Cox regression analysis (Table 3). Among tumor types,
patients who had lung cancer had the greatest hazard of

60% increase over that for patients who had breast cancer.
Both a history of surgery and a history of radiation demonstrated a slightly decreased hazard of hospitalization by
19% and 8%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The current results demonstrate an increased risk of overall mortality, early mortality, and hospitalization in
patients who experience FN compared with patients who
do not experience FN. A central consideration of this
investigation was the possibility that FN may have both
early and late effects on mortality in cancer patients
matched on key predictive characteristics because of an
increased risk of early FN-related deaths and late diseaserelated deaths potentially caused by suboptimal relative
dose intensity of chemotherapy. The occurrence of FN in
the initial chemotherapy course was associated with a statistically significant difference in both the unadjusted risk
of early mortality and the adjusted hazard of early mortalCancer

ity based on multivariate analyses. Although overall mortality rates for the propensity-matched cohorts were not
significantly different in the unadjusted comparison, the
Cox regression models did result in a significant HR for
FN on overall mortality after multivariate adjustment.
Thus, the primary impact of FN appeared to be on early
mortality, ie, within the first chemotherapy course and no
later than 12 months after the start of chemotherapy.
Because the average follow-up was 17.6 months for both
groups, extended evaluation of the association between
FN and mortality was limited. Further evaluation with
longer average follow-up is warranted to fully assess the
impact of FN on long-term outcomes. The results of the
current study suggest that hospitalized patients with FN
are more likely to experience poorer outcomes, as evidenced by the higher rate of overall mortality and particularly the higher rate of early mortality.
We conducted sensitivity analyses on the primary
results given the limitations and assumptions described
above (see Materials and Methods). We evaluated the
range of patients that would be categorized as

experiencing FN among patients who had the tumor types
of interest (n Â¼ 17,349) using various claims definitions
as stated below; the number of patients with FN ranged
from 4.5% (narrow) to 64.7% (broad). The broader FN
definition included any diagnosis with neutropenia (ICD9 code 288.0), or a diagnosis of fever (780.6), or a diagnosis of infection or procedure code for infection treatment;
the narrower definition of FN included a diagnosis with
neutropenia (ICD-9 code 288.0) and diagnosis of either
fever (780.6) or infection. In an exploratory analysis that
allowed the occurrence of FN at any time during the entire
study period, the unadjusted results demonstrated significant differences in favor of survival for various groups (Table 4). The adjusted HR for FN on early mortality was
1.54 (95% CI, 1.29-1.85), and the adjusted HR for FN on
overall mortality was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.35-1.72).
These findings support previous studies demonstrating that FN in patients who received myelosuppressive
chemotherapy had an impact on early mortality.2 It has
long been acknowledged that FN represents the major
dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppressive chemotherapy
and often results in prompt hospitalization for evaluation
and treatment with empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. A systematic review of RCTs demonstrated
that primary prophylaxis with a myeloid growth factor
may reduce the risk of infection-related and all-cause early
mortality.22 Preclinical studies as well as prospective and
retrospective clinical studies have suggested that delivered

chemotherapy dose intensity often is associated with longterm disease-free survival and overall survival.15-21 In the
current study, we did not observe a significant unadjusted
difference in the impact of FN on overall mortality when
defining FN as occurring within the first chemotherapy
course. When this criterion was relaxed to allow FN to
occur at any time during the study period, statistically significant differences were observed in favor of the non-FN
group for both early mortality and overall mortality.
The limitations of the current study were similar to
those of other observational studies using data from
healthcare claims sources. The use of a large managed care
administrative claims database provided real-world demographics, complete medical care information (inpatient,
outpatient, and pharmacy data), and follow-up for a large
cohort of patients. However, only limited information
involving clinical management, medications administered
during hospitalization, and laboratory results was available. The absence of detailed clinical records and dependence on ICD-9-CM coding to define FN was a
recognized limitation that could have resulted in misclassification of some cases of FN. Previous studies have
reported >80% sensitivity for identifying FN with these
algorithms.29 Nevertheless, such potential bias likely
would result, if anything, in reduced differences in outcomes between the FN and non-FN groups. Finally, data
on cancer diagnosis were validated in the HealthCore
Integrated Research Database, and mortality was validated through the NDI database. Detailed cancer staging
was not accessible in this study and may have had have an
unobserved impact on the comparability of FN patients
and non-FN patients. However, adjustment for the presence of metastatic disease (stage IV) was possible and may
have diminished the potential for confounding by stage.
Despite propensity score matching, prophylactic G-CSF
was received by 14% more patients with FN. This probably reflects cliniciansâ€™ judgment to administer prophylaxis to patients who had an inherently greater risk of FN.
Although G-CSF may have been used therapeutically in
patients who developed severe FN in Cycle 1, data on
such use were not available and, thus, were not addressed
further in this study.
Overall, this retrospective cohort study is 1 of the
largest such investigations reported to date on the impact
of neutropenic complications on both early and overall
mortality in â€˜â€˜real-worldâ€™â€™ clinical practice settings. The
results reported here are consistent with other observational and clinical trial results demonstrating a significant
impact of FN on cancer patient mortality.
