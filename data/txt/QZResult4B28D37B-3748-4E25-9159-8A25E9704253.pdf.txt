ABSTRACT
Epigenetic dysregulation is one of many factors that contribute to cancer
development and progression. Numerous epigenetic alterations have been identified
in urologic cancers including histone modifications, DNA methylation changes,
and microRNA expression. Since these changes are reversible, efforts are being
made to develop epigenetic drugs that restore the normal epigenetic patterns of
cells, and many clinical trials are already underway to test their clinical potential.
In this review we analyze multiple clinical trials (n=51) that test the efficacy of
these drugs in patients with urologic cancers. The most frequently used epigenetic
drugs were histone deacetylase inhibitors followed by antisense oligonucleotides,
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone demethylase inhibitors, the last of
which are only being tested in prostate cancer. In more than 50% of the clinical
trials considered, epigenetic drugs were used as part of combination therapy, which
achieved the best results. The epigenetic regulation of some cancers is still matter
of research but will undoubtedly open a window to new therapeutic approaches in
the era of personalized medicine. The future of therapy for urological malignancies
is likely to include multidrug regimens in which epigenetic modifying drugs will play
an important role.

INTRODUCTION

HISTONE MODIFICATIONS

Urologic cancers account for approximately 10% of
all cancer deaths in the USA and include bladder, kidney,
prostate and testicular cancers [1].
The establishment and progression of malignancy
involves broad changes in gene expression that are
determined by both genetic and epigenetic events.
Genetic events include chromosome rearrangements
and duplications as well as translocations, deletions, and
single base pair mutations. Epigenetic modifications are
somatically heritable changes that modify gene expression
without altering the DNA sequence. Among these are
histone modifications, DNA methylation, and miRNA
expression [2].

Post-translational modification of the histone protein
N terminal tails can alter the structure of the nucleosome
and change the compaction state of chromatin. Common
modifications
include
methylation,
acetylation,
phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation [2].
Among these, histone acetylation and methylation are best
described in cancer epigenetic dysregulation [2].
Histone acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of
lysine residues, weakening their electrostatic interactions
with DNA [3]. This leads to a more relaxed state of the
chromatin and is associated with transcriptional activation.
Addition of the acetyl group is carried out by histone
acetyltransferases (HATs), and its removal is catalyzed by

histone deacetylases (HDACs) [4]. HDACs are classified
into four distinct groups based on their homology to yeast
histone deacetylases. Class I HDACs encompass HDAC1,
2, 3 and 8 and, with the exception of HDAC8 that can
be located in the nucleus or cytoplasm, are exclusively
located in the nucleus. Class II HDACs include HDAC4,
5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 and can be present in the nucleus or
the cytoplasm [5, 6]. Class III HDACs are the sirtuins,
proteins which require the cofactor NAD+ to be active.
Unlike Class I and Class II HDACs, sirtuins are not
inhibited by known pharmacologic HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) such as Vorinostat and Trichostatin A (TSA) [5,
6].
Histone methylation occurs at lysine and
arginine residues and, depending on the target, can
lead to activation or repression of gene expression [7].
Methylation is catalyzed by histone methyltransferases
(HTMs) while demethylation is performed by histone
demethylases (HDMs). There are currently two histone
demethylase families, the lysine specific demethylases
(LSD) and the JmjC-domain-containing histone
demethylases (JHDMs) [7]. The LSDs comprise LSD1
and LSD2, which are dependent on FAD to be catalytically
active [8]. The JHDMs in turn, catalyze the hydroxylation
of the lysine methylgroup and require two factors to be
catalytically active: Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate [7].
In cancer, histone modifications have been
associated with both activation and repression of gene
expression. Modifications such as histone 3 methylation
at lysine 4 (H3K4me), histone 3 di-methylation at lysine
4 (H3K4me2), histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 4
(H3K4me3), histone 3 acetylation at lysine 9 (H3K9ac),
histone 3 methylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me) and histone
3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) are associated with
active chromatin whereas histone 3 tri-methylation at
lysine 36 (H3K36me3), histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine
9 (H3K9me3) and histone 3 methylation at lysine 27
(H3K27me) are associated with repressive chromatin [9].

context of promoter hypermethylation is associated with
an increase in H3K4me3, a histone mark characteristic of
gene activation [15].
In eukaryotes, DNA methylation is mediated by
three DNMTs: DNMT1 is responsible for the maintenance
of methylation patterns after DNA replication whereas
DNMT3A and DNMT3B carry out de novo methylation
[4]. Any alteration that affects the activity of these
enzymes can lead to an imbalance in methylation that
provides the basis, or contributes, to the initiation of
carcinogenesis.

MIRNAS
miRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs), 21-25 nucleotides in length, that regulate
gene expression by targeting specific messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) for translational repression or degradation.
Expression patterns of miRNAs differ between normal
and tumor tissues [16, 17]. Depending on their target,
miRNAs can act either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes;
downregulation of an miRNA that targets an oncogene,
or an overexpression of an miRNA that targets a tumor
suppressor gene, can promote carcinogenesis [16, 17].

EPIGENETIC DRUGS
Two strategies for epigenetic therapy are currently
in use: small molecules that inhibit epigenetic-modifying
enzymes and manipulation of miRNA expression.
Amongst the small molecule inhibitors are HDAC
inhibitors and DNMT inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) are classified into 4 groups according to their
chemical structures: hydroxamates (SB393, Vorinostat,
Panobinostat), cyclic peptides (Romidepsin), benzamides
(Entinostat and Mocetinostat) and aliphatic fatty acids
(Valproic Acid) [18].
The majority of HDACi inhibit zinc-dependent
HDACs by interacting with the zinc ion. In cancer cells,
the inhibition of histone deacetylation restores expression
of tumor suppressor genes that were previously silenced
by epigenetic mechanisms [18, 19].
DNMT inhibitors are divided into nucleoside
analogues and non-nucleoside analogs [4]. Nucleoside
analogues, such as Azacitidine, Decitabine and FdCyd,
are cytosine analogs modified at the C5 position. Inside
the cell they are metabolized and incorporated into DNA
molecules [4]. DNA methyltransferases can bind to these
modified nucleotides but their modification at C5 prevents
their methylation. It also prevents the dissociation of the
enzyme thereby reducing DNMT activity at other sites
[4]. Non-nucleoside analogues, such as Hydralazine,
Procainamide and MG98, inhibit methylation by binding
to the catalytic region of the enzyme [4].
Another focus of epigenetic therapy is the
manipulation of miRNA expression and activity. Several

DNA METHYLATION
DNA methylation results from addition of a
methyl group to the 5-carbon of a cytosine residue by the
enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) [10]. DNMT
forms a complex with CpG dinucleotides that allows the
transfer of a methyl group to the cytosine residue [10].
Many CpG sites are located in the promoter regions of
genes. Collectively they are known as CpG islands.
In general, DNA methylation of CpG islands located
in gene promoters leads to transcriptional repression.
However, there are exceptions to this classical view, in
which promoter hypermethylation is associated with
increased gene expression [11-14]. This occurs in
instances where DNA methylation drives the use of an
alternative transcription start site or inhibits the binding of
a repressive protein [15]. Increased gene expression in the

strategies have been employed to silence miRNAs that
are overexpressed in cancer. These include anti-miRNA
oligonucleotides (AMOs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAS),

miRNA-masking antisense oligonucleotides (miRmask) and miRNA sponges [16]. Restoration of miRNA
expression that has been downregulated in cancer is

achieved by administration of synthetic miRNAs or by
induced expression of miRNA coding genes using viral
constructs, such as adenovirus-associated vectors [16].
Dysregulation of epigenetic marks leads to
changes in gene expression that, in cancer cells, can
result in activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes, both of which can contribute to cancer.
Unlike genetic mutations, however, epigenetic changes are
reversible. Therefore, the development of drugs capable of
restoring the normal epigenetic patterns of cells has great
therapeutic potential. In this review we discuss the efficacy
of this novel therapeutic approach through the analysis of
clinical trials of epigenetic therapies conducted in prostate,
kidney and bladder cancers.

CCDN2, GSTP1 and RARβ2 genes, involved in cell cycle
control, DNA repair mechanisms and hormonal responses
respectively, are hypermethylated in prostate cancer.
Alteration of their normal methylation status is correlated
with poor clinical prognosis [26]. As with many epigenetic
alterations, these biomarkers are useful in diagnosis and
prognosis of disease [25, 26].
Finally, miRNA levels are also altered in prostate
cancer, affecting the expression of genes involved in cell
cycle control, apoptosis, migration, and invasion [27].
Levels of miRNAs also have the potential to be used
as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis [25]. As an
example, miR-141 is upregulated in prostate cancer [25,
28]. Serum levels of this miRNA can distinguish between
tumor and healthy tissue and higher levels of miR-141
are associated with worse prognosis [28]. miR-449a is
another miRNA that is downregulated in prostate cancer.
It targets HDAC1, so its downregulation contributes to
overexpression of this enzyme, showing that epigeneticmodifying enzymes are often regulated epigenetically [27,
29].

METHODS
We performed a comprehensive literature review
and searched for clinical trials from the United States
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and European (https://www.
clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) databases. Relevant articles on
the subject were also retrieved from PubMed database
using keywords encapsulating all types of epigenetic
therapies and urologic cancers (examples: “epigenetic
therapy” AND “urologic cancer”, “prostate cancer”
AND “HDACi”, “kidney cancer” AND “DNMTi”).
To guarantee that most of the data on the subject was
included, the reference sections of the captured articles
were also filtered for relevant articles.

Prostate cancer - current treatment
Prostate cancer treatment is disease stage-specific.
Epigenetic therapies have thus far been limited to the
advanced form of castrate resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). Currently there are several chemotherapeutic
agents approved for the treatment of advanced CRPC:
Sipuleucel T, Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel, Abiraterone,
Alpharadin and Enzalutamide [30-35]. Although all
of these agents have shown efficacy, strategies for the
sequence of administration and their combination are
still being optimized [36]. Treatment resistance is a major
concern with some of these agents, including Abiraterone
and Enzalutamide, reflecting the need for ongoing
development of novel therapeutic strategies [36]. Since
epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the development
of treatment resistance, epigenetic therapy is an intriguing
addition to the CRPC therapy arsenal [37].

Prostate cancer - epigenetics
Dysregulation of epigenetic-modifying enzymes
disturbs normal epigenetic patterns and is associated
with cancer development and progression. In prostate
cancer, DNA methyltransferases are upregulated [20,
21]. Histone-modifying enzymes, such as HDACs are
upregulated in prostate cancer [22]. HMTs and HDMs
show variable changes in expression with a tendency for
upregulation of HMTs and lower expression of HDMs
[23, 24]. Prognostically, overexpression of HDAC2 is
associated with a shortened time before prostate cancer
recurrence as shown in a subgroup of patients with
Gleason Score 7 carcinomas, [6].
Specific histone modifications have also been
associated with prostate cancer [25, 26]. The levels of
histone marks H3Ac and H3K9me2 are significantly
lower in tumor tissue when compared to normal tissue
[26]. Conversely, an increase in H3K27me3 is found in
metastatic tissue relative to localized tumors and normal
prostatic tissue [25]. Finally, higher levels of H3K4me1
are associated with a higher probability of recurrence [26].
Changes in DNA methylation are also evident in
prostate cancer and are targets for epigenetic therapy. The

Prostate cancer - pre-clinical data
Pre-clinical studies in prostate cancer cell lines
demonstrate that treatment with HDACi can restore
susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes,
antiandrogens, and mTOR inhibitors [38-40]. Combined
therapy using HDACi and taxanes prevents tumor
growth and increases cell death rate when compared to
a monotherapeutic approach [38]. Liu et al showed that
low doses of the HDACi Panobinostat can restore the
susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to hormonal therapy
with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen Bicalutamide [39].
The HDACi Belinostat (PXD101) can also downregulate

the androgen receptor, preventing the onset of castration
resistant prostate cancer in vivo in the context of hormonal
therapy [41].
An in vitro study of the HDACi Panobinostat in
combination with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin in
prostate cancer cell lines resulted in a decrease in HIF1α expression leading to inhibition of angiogenesis [40].
Combined therapy with these agents was more efficient
than either one administrated alone [40].
Cancer stem cells are thought to be responsible for
treatment resistance and tumor recurrence [42] and present
epigenetic alterations that contribute to their ability to
resist therapy [42]. Epigenetic therapeutics may therefore
have the potential to target not only the bulk tumor but
also this key subset of cells [42]. A study carried out
by Frame et al revealed that prostate stem-like cells are
more resistant to radiotherapy [43]. However, combined
therapy with HDACi restored sensibility to radiotherapy
[43]. Additionally, prostate stem-like cells treated jointly
with the HDACi Trichostatin A and radiotherapy showed a
significant reduction in the number of cell colonies formed
when compared to treatment with radiation alone [43].

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the
identification of biomarkers that predict whether a
specific therapy (including epigenetic therapies) will be
beneficial, is essential to improving cancer treatment.
Recently, it has been reported that prostate cells positive
for the presence of androgen receptor and cellular prostatic
acid phosphatase show greater response to treatment with
HDACi than cells without this pattern of expression [44].
At the level of DNA methylation, reversion of
methylation can restore expression of genes silenced by
this epigenetic mechanism. Treatment of human prostate
cancer cells with Procainamide, a non-nucleoside DNMT
inhibitor, results in a decrease in GSTP1 methylation levels
and a consequent increase in gene expression [45]. In vivo,
treatment of immunodeficient mice carrying xenograft
tumors with Procainamide resulted in a significant
reduction in tumor size, suggesting clinical efficacy [45].
Resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate
cancer is mediated by several mechanisms. Alterations
at the DNA level include androgen receptor gene
amplifications and point mutations [46]. However, these
modifications account for only a minority of cases.
12489

Downstream activation of the androgen receptor pathway
and activation of an alternative signaling pathway can
also contribute to hormonal therapy resistance [46].
Hypermethylation of the androgen receptor promoter
region correlates with decreased androgen receptor
expression and is also associated with the development
of hormonal therapy resistance [47]. In vivo studies reveal
that long-term treatment of prostate cancer cells with
the DNMTi Azacitidine led to a significant reduction
in cell proliferation due to increased androgen receptor
expression. Moreover, androgen receptor induction
restored sensitivity to the antiandrogen agent Bicalutamide
[47].
The DNA demethylating agent, Disulfiram, has
also been tested in prostate cancer cells. Treatment with
Disulfiram resulted in the reestablishment of APC and
RARβ gene expression, both of which are known to be
hypermethylated and inactive in prostate cancer [48]. Cell
growth inhibition was observed in vitro, and in vivo using
prostate cancer xenograft models [48].
Finally, microRNAs modulators have been tested
in preclinical studies as potential therapeutic options for
prostate cancer. miR-16 regulates the expression of genes
involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis such as CDK1,
CDK2 and BCL2 [49, 50]. Transfection of a synthetic
miR-16 reduced the proliferative capacity of several
prostate cancer cell lines [49]. In vivo, Takeshita et al
used the atelocollagen method to deliver miR-16 to bone
metastases via the mouse tail vein. They subsequently
observed a suppression in metastasis growth, indicating
not only efficacy of the treatment but also of the delivery
method [49].
Like
HDACi
and
DNMTi,
antisense
oligonucleotides can restore the sensitivity of cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic agents. Upregulation of the Bcl2 and
CLU genes in prostate cancer is linked to chemoresistance
and cancer progression [51, 52]. Knockdown of these
genes by antisense oligonucleotides decreases gene
expression and reestablishes tumor sensitivity to taxanebased chemotherapy [51, 52]. Furthermore, transfection
of miR-449a into prostate cancer cells lines caused cell
cycle arrest and a decrease in HDAC1 levels, an effect
also observed after knockdown of HDAC1 using an siRNA
[29]. The inhibitory effect of miR-449a on cell cycle
progression was associated with increased expression of
the protein p27 [29].
These results demonstrate the potential for
epigenetic therapies to advance prostate cancer treatment.

results were obtain with the administration of the HDACi
Panobinostat (Table1: NCT00667862, [54, 55]. Stable
disease was reported in two clinical trials, but in one of
them conversion from an unfavorable circulating tumor
cell profile to a favorable one was observed in 64% of
the patients (Table 1: NCT01075308, NCT00667862,
NCT00330161, [53, 54, 56]).
Most common side effects were grade 2 fatigue and
nausea. In addition, HDACi SB939 caused five patients to
experience one or more grade 3 complications (Table 1:
NCT01075308, [53]). More severe side effects were noted
with HDACi Panobinostat, resulting in 71, 4% of the
patients experiencing one or more grade 3 adverse effects
and four subjects reporting grade 4 adverse effects (Table1:
NCT00667862, [54]). Another trial using Panobinostat
reported no grade 4 toxicities when administered as
monotherapy [55], however, when administered in
combination with Docetaxel, seven patients experienced
grade 4 toxicities [55] (Table 1). HDACi Vorinostat also
showed a complex side effect profile. When administered
alone in patients pre-treated with chemotherapeutic agents
it led to the development of grade 3/4 toxicities in 48% of
the patients, with 41% of the patients forced to discontinue
therapy due to their severity (Table 1: NCT00330161,
[56]). A second trial of Vorinostat in combination with
docetaxel was terminated early due to excessive toxicity
as five patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities,
including two patients experiencing neutropenic fever and
sepsis. The other three patients reported an anaphylactic
reaction, a myocardial infarction and a gastrointestinal
bleed, respectively (Table 1: NCT00565227, [58]). Finally,
a trial of the HDACi Romidepsin in metastatic prostate
cancer resulted in no grade 4 toxicities, and grade 3 events
represented only 4.7% of all reported adverse effects
(Table 1: NCT00106418, [57]).
Curcumin, a compound found in the spice
turmeric, is another HDACi [59]. A trial of Curcumin in
prostate cancer showed no PSA response when used in
combination with radiotherapy (Table 1: NCT01917890,
[60]). However, there was a significant reduction in
urinary symptoms, one of the most common side effects
of radiotherapy (Table 1: NCT01917890, [60]). Two
additional trials testing Curcumin in the treatment of
prostate cancer are ongoing (Table 1: NCT02095717,
NCT02064673).
DNMT inhibitors have also showed promising
results in clinical trials of prostate cancer. When treated
with the DNMTi disulfiram, five patients achieved a
transient demethylation response. No grade 4 adverse
effects were observed in this trial but 6 patients were
forced to quit due to treatment toxicity (Table 1:
NCT01118741, [61]). The DNMTi Azacitidine was trialed
in chemonaive patients with CRPC in combination with
combined androgen blockade (CAB). PSA doubling time
increased relative to patients receiving only CAB and no
grade 4 toxicities were reported, although 4 patients had to

Prostate cancer - clinical data
Clinical trials using HDAC inhibitors for the
treatment of prostate cancer showed a PSA response in
five studies, three of which resulted in a decrease in PSA
levels of ≥50% (Table 1: NCT01075308, NCT00667862,

Azacitidine has also been tested in combination
with Docetaxel and Prednisone in CRPC (Table 1:
NCT00503984). Therapeutic response was assessed by
magnetic resonance imaging with a complete response
considered the disappearance of target lesions, and a
partial response considered a ≥30% decrease in the sum
of the longest diameter of targeted lesions. Complete
and partial responses were achieved by only one and
two patients, respectively. A PSA response was observed
in 10 patients. Despite some positive results, the study
was terminated due to withdrawal of funding (Table 1:
NCT00503984). More studies are needed to assess the
clinical potential of this agent.
Another category of epigenetic drugs with clinical
potential in cancer treatment are HDM inhibitors.
Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)
inhibitor used in the treatment of psychiatric disease.
MAOA is an enzyme responsible for the deamination
of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin
and norepinephrine, that are important in a variety of
neurological and psychiatric illnesses [63]. MAOA has
close homology to LSD1, a histone demethylase, which
catalyzes removal of the methyl group from H3K4me1
and H3K4me2. As a result of this homology, Phenelzine
is able to bind and inhibit LSD1. [63]. Lower levels of
H3K4me2 are correlated with higher risk of recurrence in
prostate cancer [64]. Phenelzine is currently being trialed
as a monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent prostate
cancer and in combination with docetaxel for the treatment
of progressive prostate cancer. Given that Phenelzine is
already an approved medication, positive responses in
these clinical trials will open the door to using this class
of epigenetic drugs in clinical practice in the near future.
In the area of miRNA modulation, four clinical
trials of antisense oligonucleotides have reported a
positive PSA response, with three trials describing a PSA
response >=50% (Table 1: NCT01188187, NCT00471432,
NCT00085228, [65-68]). One of these trials, evaluating
the efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide OGX-011 in
combination with docetaxel or mitoxantrone, reported a
PSA decrease ≥50% in 6 of 14 patients with CRPC (Table
1: NCT00471432, [66]). Most of the adverse effects were
grade 1 and 2 only, however adverse effects of grade 3
or higher affected 60% of the patients receiving the
antisense oligonucleotide in combination with docetaxel/
prednisone and 73% of the patients receiving the OGX011 in combination with mitoxantrone/prednisone (Table
1: NCT00471432, [66]). The most common grade 3 or
higher adverse effects in both groups were fatigue and
lymphopenia (Table 1: NCT00471432, [66]). OGX011 was also tested in combination with docetaxel and
prednisone in a phase III clinical trial but, despite some
positive results observed in phase II of the study where
58% of the patients had a PSA response >=50%, no
significant results were observed in phase III (Table 1:
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NCT00471432, NCT01188187, [66, 69]). In the group
receiving the combined therapy OGX-011/docetaxel/
prednisone, 41% of the patients had to discontinue the
treatment program due to adverse effects of the therapy
(≥3 grade) (Table 1: NCT01188187, [69]).
Administration of the antisense oligonucleotide
LY2181308 to decrease the expression of survivin, an
anti-apoptotic gene involved in therapy resistance was
tested in a randomized phase 2 clinical trial performed by
Wiecho et al for the treatment of CRPC [70]. The patients
allocated in the group treated with LY2181308 reported
higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse effects without
any improvement in progression free survival or overall
survival of the patients [70].
Disappointing results were obtained with another
antisense oligonucleotide, Oblimersen, that was trailed
by Sternberg et al both alone and in combination with
docetaxel (Table 1: NCT00085228, [67]). The authors
observed a PSA response in 46% of the patients treated
with docetaxel alone, versus 37% of the patients treated
with the antisense oligonucleotide and docetaxel (Table 1:
NCT00085228, [67]). In the group of patients receiving
the combined therapy, major toxic events were observed
in 40.7% of the patients, compared to 22.8% of the
patients receiving the antisense oligonucleotide alone,
indicating that docetaxel increased oblimersen-related
toxicity. This suggests that combined therapy with
antisense oligonucleotides and taxanes might not the best
therapeutic approach (Table 1: NCT00085228, [67]). In
another clinical trial Oblimersen was administrated in
combination with mitoxantrone, with 2 patients out of 25
showing a PSA decrease equal or superior to 50%. One
patient had a PSA response inferior to 50% while stable
disease was observed in a further five patients [68].
Although no clinical benefits were observed in a
study testing the antisense oligonucleotides ISIS 3512 and
ISIS 5132, two patients who received the oligonucleotide
ISIS 3512 and one patient who received ISIS 5132 did
not show disease progression for at least five months
[71]. Finally, results are currently unavailable from eight
completed clinical trials and two other trials are ongoing
(Table 1).

Kidney cancer - epigenetics
Genetic and epigenetic dysregulation of genes
involved in pathways such as the hypoxia-inducible
pathway, the mTOR pathway, and the cMET-RAF-MEKERK pathway contribute to the progression of kidney
cancer [72]. Changes in the levels of epigenetic-modifying
enzymes are an important factor in altering expression of
genes involved in cancer-related pathways. In renal cell
carcinoma (RCC), an increase in the levels of histone
demethylases such as UTX, JMJD2 and EZH2, results
in a reduction in H3K27me and promotes progression of
the disease [73, 74]. Also in RCC, almost 60% of patients

overexpress HDAC1 and HDAC2 [75]. No prognostic
value has been associated with these alterations [75].
HDAC3 is also highly expressed, but only in the papillary
carcinoma subset [75].
At the level of individual epigenetic changes,
low levels of H3K4me2, H3K18Ac, and H3K9me2
are associated with poor prognosis and lower survival
probability in RCC. , Mechanistically, H3K4me2 and
H3K18Ac are associated with active transcription while
H3K9me2 is associated with transcriptional repression
[73, 74]. H3K27me is another histone modification
that correlates with poor clinical outcome, result of
overexpression of histone demethylases in RCC [73, 74].
Clear cell RCC is the most common form of renal
cell carcinoma, and is associated with inactivation of the
tumor suppressor gene von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) by either
genetic and epigenetic factors [76, 77]. VHL inactivation
in both sporadic and familial forms can occur due to point
mutations or deletions at the genetic level, or due to DNA
hypermethylation at the gene promoter [76, 77].
DNA methylation also affects the regulation of
several genes in RCC and has the potential to be used as

biomarker and as a therapeutic target [78]. For example,
hypermethylation of RASSF1A and HIC in patients with
RCC is associated with a poor prognosis [79, 80].
Several miRNAs showed altered expression in RCC,
resulting in changes to important cellular functions such as
apoptosis, angiogenesis and the epithelial mesenchymal
transition [27, 81]. Examples of miRNAs with altered
expression in RCC include miR-210, miR-34a, miR-30c,
miR-29b and miR-23b [27, 81].

Kidney cancer - current treatment
Radical nephrectomy is the standard of care for
localized renal cell carcinoma. However, high rates of
recurrence after surgery demand the development of
new adjuvant therapies. Both radiotherapy and hormone
therapy have proven ineffective in advanced stages of
disease and chemotherapy has a response rate inferior to
10% [82, 83].

Decitabine. When used in combination with the cytokine
IL-2 in a phase II study of advanced RCC, three out of
five patients showed stable disease [92]. Another study
combining Decitabine with interferon-α was terminated
early due to low accrual (Table 1, NCT00561912).
Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides has also
resulted in stabilization of disease in some RCC patients.
The antisense oligonucleotide GTI-2040, targeting the R2
subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, was tested in patients
with metastatic disease in a phase II trial and generated
a partial response for approximately eight months [93].
One patient experienced a dose limiting toxicity (grade 3
diarrhea) and adverse effects of all grades were reported
in this trial including grade 4 pancytopenia, pulmonary
embolism and bone pain [93]. In a trial reported by
Winquist et al, in which the antisense oligonucleotide
MG98 was administered to 15 patients, no objective
responses were observed with nine patients presenting
progression of the disease. MG98 targets DNMT1 but no
decrease in enzyme activity was observed [94]. Also, grade
3 and 4 adverse effects forced 8 patients to discontinue
treatment, primarily due to elevations in alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels [94].
miRNA mimics have also been trialed in RCC.
MRX34, an miRNA mimic of the tumor suppressor
miRNA34, was tested in a phase I clinical trial for
advanced or metastatic cancers, including RCC, but the
trial was terminated early due to serious immunologic
adverse events (Table 2: NCT01829971).

Preclinical studies using epigenetic drugs for kidney
cancer treatment show some promise. In renal cancer cell
lines, the HDACi Panobinostat induced cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis and also resulted in a reduction in tumor
size in xenograft mice models [84]. Pre-clinical studies
of DNMT inhibitors in kidney cancer have also shown
promise with evidence of reactivation of silenced genes
and growth inhibition of cancer cells [85, 86].
One ongoing issue in RCC treatment is resistance
to immunomodulatory therapy with interferons. This
can occur via promoter hypermethylation and silencing
of interferon response genes [87]. Treatment of renal
cancer cell lines with 5-Aza-2’-deoxycitidine (5-Aza-dC),
increased expression of interferon response genes and
restored interferon induced apoptosis [87]. In addition,
treatment of RCC cells with the antisense DNMT1
oligonucleotide MG98 also restored susceptibility to
interferon therapy [88].
Downregulation of miR-30c in RCC is associated
with promotion of the epithelial mesenchymal transition
[89]. Reduced expression of this miRNA is associated
with hypoxia and VHL cell status with lower levels of
miR-30c being observed in VHL-deficient RCC cell lines
[89]. Transfection of a RNA mimic to restore miR-30c
levels caused an increase in E-cadherin expression and
reduced cell migration capacity [89].

Kidney cancer - clinical trials

Bladder cancer - epigenetics

Trials of HDACi in RCC have shown mixed
responses. HDACi Vorinostat used as a monotherapy
showed an objective response in 36% of patients, however
63% of the patients presented disease progression at
6 months (Table 2: s). When used in combination with
Bevacizumab, 48, 6 % of the patients showed stable
disease at 6 months (Table 2: NCT00324870). By
contrast, treatment with Panobinostat alone resulted in
no objective responses, and a median of progression-free
survival of 1.7 months (Table 2: NCT00550277, [90]).
Treatment was generally well tolerated, but 7 patients
reported thrombocytopenia grade 3 or higher (Table 2:
NCT00550277, [90]). In a separate small phase I trial, the
HDACi Entinostat was administered in combination with
Isotretinoin. One patient, who had presented with disease
progression after treatment with cytokines and antiangiogenic therapy, subsequently showed stable disease
[91]. The patient had a reduction in tumor size after
4 months of therapy and did not show signs of disease
progression at 12 months [91]. However, the number of
patients enrolled in the study (2) was insufficient to draw
any conclusions [91].
The only DNMT inhibitor tested in RCC is

Epigenetic modifications are important in bladder
cancer development [95]. An increase in global histone
methylation was reported in bladder cancer samples,
particularly in the subset of patients with non-muscular
invasive bladder cancer. In these patients, a global increase
in H3K9 and H3K27 methylation was associated with
high-grade tumors. However, the authors did not find
any correlation between histone methylation and tumor
recurrence or survival [96]. Interestingly, another study
by the same group revealed that a decrease in methylation
levels of other histone proteins, namely H3K4 and H3K20,
could be a prognostic biomarker for muscle invasive
bladder cancer [97]. The presence of different histone
methylation patterns in muscle invasive and non-invasive
bladder cancer, suggests that patients of these subgroups
will respond differentially to epigenetic therapies affecting
histone methylation. These data reinforce the need for
biomarker discovery to predict responses to epigenetic
therapy.
With respect to DNA methylation in bladder cancer,

with bladder cancer [98]. Detection of methylation patterns
in urine samples has proven to be a good diagnostic
strategy in bladder cancer. [99, 100]. Methylation of
some gene promoters can also be indicative of prognosis,
for example, methylation of the RUNX3 promoter is
associated with a higher risk of progression and lower
survival [101].
Differential miRNA expression is another
epigenetic feature of bladder cancer and can distinguish
between cancer patients and healthy subjects [27, 102].
The miRNAs implicated in bladder cancer target genes
involved in cell cycle control, cell proliferation, cell
differentiation and signal transduction pathways [27,
102]. Both upregulation and downregulation of miRNA
expression can potentiate cancer development. In bladder
cancer, loss of miR-200 is associated with epithelial
mesenchymal transition while upregulation of miR-21 and
miR-129 is associated with high grade tumors and poor
prognosis, respectively [27, 102, 103].

Bladder cancer - pre-clinical data
Proteomic studies after exposure of bladder
cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors reveals that HDAC
activity influences many cellular pathways involved in
carcinogenesis [107]. The treatment of bladder cancer
cell lines with these agents resulted in cell growth
suppression and induction of cell death [107]. Wang et al
showed that the HDACi Vorinostat was able to induced
cell growth inhibition in bladder cancer cells in part due
to downregulation of survivin, an apoptosis inhibitory
protein [108]. Importantly, Vorinostat had a synergistic
effect with chemotherapeutic agents including Cisplatin,
Mitomycin c, and Adriamycin. Combined therapy of using
Vorinostat and Cisplatin prevented cancer progression in
an animal model [108].
Positive responses were also obtained in bladder
cancer cells after administration of the DNMTi Belinostat.
A significant decrease in cell proliferation was observed
in vitro, and in vivo with the use of a transgenic mouse
model [109].
Epigenetic drugs can be used in combination
with other agents to enhance their efficacy. Shang et al
evaluated the DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine
in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in bladder
transitional cell carcinoma cell lines. The authors
demonstrated that DAC enhances susceptibility to
Cisplatin, a common agent used as neoadjuvant therapy
for bladder cancer, in a synergistic way. Both agents
induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, with Cisplatin
also inducing tumor cell apoptosis [110].
Rieger et al compared the efficacy and efficiency of

Bladder cancer - current treatment
Muscle invasion is a critical factor in the selection
of the right therapeutic option for bladder cancer. In the
case of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the standard
clinical approach is transurethelial resection followed by
administration of chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic
agents [104]. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a
more aggressive form, the standard of care is radical
cystectomy [105]. In cases of disease relapse, occurring
in approximately 30% of patients, combinatory
chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin are used.
These include MVAC (Methrotrexate, Vinblastine,
Achiamycin and Cisplatin) and GC (Gemcitabine and
Cisplatin). Despite positive early responses to these
therapeutic modalities, the median survival rate after
treatment is only 12 months [104-106]. For advanced

Of all the clinical trials analyzed in this study, 16
included evaluation of gene expression and/or DNA
methylation as a secondary objective of the trial. We feel
that analysis of gene expression and epigenetic patterns
should be included in all clinical trials using epigenetic
agents in order to assess the causal link between drug
induced alterations and therapeutic responses. A better
knowledge of the specific mechanism of action of these
agents is essential to overcoming their clinical limitations
and improving therapeutic success.
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) avoid some
of the issues described above as as they are designed to
be more target specific. Thus far, two separate studies of
ASOs as monotherapy have shown no objective responses
[71, 94], however when used in combination with other
agents the results have been more promising [66, 93].
However, ASOs also have their limitations secondary to
toxicity and delivery efficiency [67, 69].
Currently, cancer treatment is determined largely
according to cancer stage, even though patients with
similar stage cancers may respond differently to the same
type of therapy. The promise of “personalized medicine”
is the idea that tailoring treatment to an individual
patient will optimize efficacy while minimizing toxicity.
Personalization should be an ongoing goal for all cancer
therapy development, including epigenetic therapies.
Biomarker development should thus be a central goal in
the development of epigenetic therapies, both so that the
correct patient receives the correct therapy, and to ensure
that therapies that have value in a subset of patients
are not passed over because of lack of efficacy in other
patients. Epigenetic therapies are still in their infancy as
a therapeutic class and pre-clinical promise has not yet
translated into clinical efficacy. However, the development
of target-specific agents, and the careful combination of
epigenetic therapies with traditional modalities should
enable them to achieve clinical success in the near future.

siRNAS and antisense oligonucleotides against Bcl-xL in
bladder cancer cell lines. Their effect in combined therapy
with chemotherapeutic agents was also tested. Both agents
enhanced tumor cell apoptosis when administrated with
Cisplatin, however Bcl-xL knockout was more efficient
with siRNAs than with antisense oligonucleotides [111].
Another study showed that simultaneous knockout of BclxL and survivin with siRNAs in bladder cancer cells led
to greater sensitization of the cells to chemotherapeutic
agents [112].

Bladder cancer - clinical data
Relative few studies of epigenetic therapies have
been undertaken in bladder cancer. Only one of three
clinical trials employing HDAC inhibitors showed a
positive response; in this trial, four of fifteen patients
treated with the HDACi Belinostat in combination with
Carboplatin or Paclitaxel showed complete or partial
response to treatment, while five patients presented
disease progression with a median time to progression
of 136 days (Table 3, NCT00421889). Further studies
employing this HDACi in combination with other agents
are essential to confirm its therapeutic potential [109].
The only study using the HDACi Vorinostat terminated
due to lack of efficacy (Table 3, NCT00363883). Three
other phase 2 clinical trials employing epigenetic drugs for
bladder cancer treatment are currently ongoing (Table 3:
NCT02236195, NCT00978250, NCT01780545).

CONCLUSIONS
Despite the obvious importance of epigenetics in the
development of cancer, few epigenetic therapies have thus
far reached advanced clinical testing. As the data above
demonstrates, pre-clinical data has not translated into
the hoped-for clinical responses. This is likely secondary
to the nonspecific actions of epigenetic drugs and the
consequent toxicities associated with their administration.
Many of the epigenetic therapies being tested
have global epigenetic effects on both cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, some of them have
additional non-epigenetic effects that limit their efficacy.
HDAC enzymes, for instance, target non-histone proteins
involved in oncologic pathways unrelated to epigenetic
regulation [113]. It is important to consider that the
observed therapeutic responses to HDACi treatment may
thus be the result of the altered activity of these proteins
and not to the reversal of specific epigenetic marks
[113]. Similarly, demethylating agents are not specific
to genes involved in carcinogenesis but result in global
demethylation of the genome, an epigenetic signature
associated with genomic instability that can lead to severe
side effects [113].
