Abstract
To improve treatment efficacy, we decided to simultaneously target HER1 and
HER2 with trastuzumab and cetuximab. Following promising preclinical results,
we conducted a phase 1-2 trial in advanced pancreatic cancer patients after firstline gemcitabine-based chemotherapy failure. In this single-arm, non-randomized,
multicenter trial, patients received weekly cetuximab (400mg/m², then 250mg/m²).
They were sequentially included in two trastuzumab dose levels: 3.0 or 4.0mg/kg,
then 1.5 or 2.0mg/kg/weekly. Endpoints were the objective response rate,
safety, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). During phase 1 (n=10
patients), toxicities were evenly distributed except for skin toxicities that frequently
caused compliance issues. The higher dose level was defined as the trastuzumab
recommended dose. During phase 2 (n=39 patients), toxicities were mainly cutaneous
reactions and asthenia. No objective response was observed. Nine patients were
stabilized but arrested treatment due to toxicity. Median PFS was 1.8 months (95%CI:
1.7-2.0 months) and median OS was 4.6 months (95%CI: 2.7–6.6 months). Both were
positively correlated with skin toxicity severity (P=0.027 and P=0.001, respectively).
Conventional phase 1 dose-escalation schedules are unsuitable for targeted therapies
because most cutaneous toxicities are not considered dose-limiting toxicities. The
compliance issues caused by skin toxicities were particularly detrimental because of
the toxicity-response correlation.

Introduction

than TRA + erlotinib or lapatinib alone in xenografted
mice [21].
Here, we report the results of the first multicenter
phase 1-2 clinical trial to evaluate the TRA + CET
combination for the treatment of patients with advanced
pancreatic cancer after failure of gemcitabine-based firstline chemotherapy.

Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cause
of cancer in the United States and the fourth leading
cause of cancer death, with an estimated 42 000 new
cases and 35 000 associated deaths in 2009 [1]. Despite
its modest clinical benefit, gemcitabine has been the only
approved first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic
cancer for 15 years [2]. Combinations of fluorouracil,
irinotecan, oxaliplatin and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX), or
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are often administered as
first-line treatment to patients with metastatic pancreatic
cancer and a good performance status [3,4]. To increase
the chemotherapy efficacy, several studies have assessed
the combination of gemcitabine with targeted therapies;
however, most regimens evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials
failed to show any overall survival (OS) improvement [5–
9]. Indeed, only one randomized trial [8] (n=569 patients)
that compared gemcitabine alone or combined with
erlotinib showed a modest, but significant OS increase
in the erlotinib+ gemcitabine arm (5.9 vs 6.2 months,
P=0.025).
The expression and role of epidermal growth factor
receptors (EGFR/HER1 and HER2) have been widely
studied, including in pancreatic cancer [10–15]. Moreover,
17% to 33% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas overexpress
HER2, and HER2-positive status has also been correlated
with shorter survival [10]. With the aim of optimizing
therapeutic strategies, EGFR expression in pancreatic
tumors has been determined in some clinical trials in order
to assess its potential role in predicting treatment efficacy.
As part of a pilot study, the combination of
trastuzumab (TRA; anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody)
and gemcitabine was well tolerated, but showed
limited therapeutic benefit in 34 patients with HER2overexpressing metastatic pancreatic cancer [16].
Cetuximab (CET; anti-HER1 monoclonal antibody) was
also assessed in combination with gemcitabine in a phase 2
study that included 41 patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer overexpressing HER1 [17]. However, the results
of two recent randomized studies combining gemcitabinebased chemotherapy with CET were disappointing [9,18].
We therefore decided to assess a strategy in which
HER1 and HER2 are simultaneously targeted. In a
first preclinical study, we found that the trastuzumab +
matuzumab (anti-HER1 antibody) combination was
more efficient in inhibiting tumor progression in
mice xenografted with human pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines than each antibody alone. This synergistic
effect was associated with a decrease in HER1/HER2
phosphorylation [19]. We then observed that the TRA +
CET combination was more efficient as first- and
second-line treatment than the standard chemotherapy
(gemcitabine) in nude mice bearing human pancreatic
cancer xenografts [20]. Finally, we demonstrated that the
TRA + CET combination had a better synergistic effect

Results
Over a 15-month period, 10 patients
were enrolled in the phase 1 and 39 patients
in the phase 2 of this study (Fig. 1).
One patient could not be evaluated in phase 2 because
of screening failure. Table 2 summarizes the baseline
characteristics of the enrolled patients. All patients had
previously received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and
many patients had also been treated with a second-line or
even later cycles of palliative chemotherapy; 60% (phase 1)
and 79% (phase 2) of patients had liver metastases and
half of our study population had serum Ca 19.9 ≥ 65 UI/mL
(without jaundice). Safety could not be evaluated in two
patients (Fig. 1).
In the phase 1 part, patients in cohort 1 (n=3)
received two cycles of treatment and patients in cohort
2 (n=7) received one or two cycles of treatment (but
for one patient who received six cycles) (Fig. 1). The
median duration of treatment was 1.9 months (range:
0.9 -5.8 months). In cohort 1 (n=3), the median relative
dose intensity (RDI) was 89% for both CET and TRA.
In cohort 2 (n=7), the median RDI was 65% for CET
and 67% for TRA. Indeed, toxicities (not considered as
DLTs) occurred in all patients and were responsible for
treatment delay or interruption. Premature discontinuation
was due to disease progression in nine patients and to skin
toxicity in one patient from cohort 2. This toxicity event
required a treatment delay longer than 15 days and was
thus considered as a DLT (the only one in the phase 1 of
this study). Two patients died from disease-related events.
The main toxicities included asthenia (grade 1: one event;
grade 2: four; grade 4: two), anorexia (grade 1: one event;
grade 2: two; grade 3: one) and rash/acne (grade 1: two
events; grade 3: five). Grade 3 toxicities were evenly
distributed, except for skin toxicities that were more
frequent (two patients in cohort 1, and three patients in
cohort 2). Based on these results, the recommended doses
for the phase 2 study were 400 mg/m² CET (loading dose)
followed by a 250 mg/m² dose, combined with 4.0 mg/m²
TRA (loading dose) and then 2.0 mg/kg.
In the phase 2 study, 10 patients (26%) received
one cycle, 21 (55%) received two cycles and 7 patients
(19%) received three to five cycles of treatment. The
median treatment duration was 1.8 months (range:
0.9-4.8 months). The median RDI was 67% for CET
and 74% for TRA (range: 0% - 100% for both). A RDI
≥ 80% was obtained in 12 patients (32%) for CET and

prematurely stopped the treatment mainly due to toxicity
or disease progression (two patients died from diseaserelated events). Phase 2 toxicities are detailed in Table 3.
No toxicity-related death was reported and most adverse
events were grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported
grade 3 adverse events were cutaneous toxicities (n=19).
Other non-cutaneous grade 3 toxicities included asthenia
(n=6), metabolism alterations (n=4), hematological (n=4)
and cardiovascular (n=4) events. The three reported grade
4 toxicities were thrombosis/embolism (n=2) and asthenia

with those of the phase 1 patients who received the same
TRA dose (cohort 2, n=6). The median follow-up for the
pooled patients (n=44) was 3.7 months (range: 0.4-22.9
months). The median PFS was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7 2.0 months), while the median OS was 4.6 months (95% CI:
2.7 – 6.6 months) (Fig. 2A and 2B). Both PFS and OS
were significantly (and positively) correlated with the
severity of skin toxicities (Fig. 2C and 2D), as detailed
in Table 4B.
Concerning the ancillary experiments, KRAS status

could be assessed in 24/44 patients (55%) and HER1
and HER2 expression levels in 25/44 patients (57%) and
28/44 patients (64%), respectively (Table 5). Fcγ receptor
polymorphisms (FcγRIIA-H131R and FcγRIIIA-V158F)
were determined in 29/44 patients (66%). Four tumors
(16%) expressed both HER1 and HER2 and in three
of them a KRAS mutation was detected. No statistical
correlation was found between these five parameters
which can be involved in the efficacy of CET [25],
TRA [26] or mAbs in general [25], and the response to

are not efficient when administered individually with
conventional chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic
cancer [9,16,18]. However, our survival results should
be compared with those obtained with second-line
palliative chemotherapy after gemcitabine failure. In our
study, 23 patients (48%) had already received palliative
chemotherapy as first-line treatment and 19 patients (40%)
had already received palliative chemotherapy as secondline or even later treatment. In a randomized phase 3 trial
that compared best supportive care (BSC) with combined
oxaliplatin/folinic acid/5-FU (OFF regimen) as secondline treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer, OS was 4.82 months [95% CI: 4.29–5.35] in the
OFF arm and 2.30 months [95% CI: 1.76–2.83] in the BSC
arm (P=0.008) [27]. In another phase 3 randomized trial
evaluating cisplatin/folinic acid/5-FU vs gemcitabine as
first- and second-line treatment for patients with metastatic
pancreatic cancer [28], PFS (from second-line start to
progression) was 1.6 months, which is similar to our
results. Moreover, patients in which disease was stabilized
discontinued the treatment due to toxicity, suggesting that
more work should be done to determine the optimal dose
to allow good efficacy with acceptable toxicities.
Indeed, the way the recommended dose was
determined in the phase 1 trial should be discussed. The
traditional DLT definition, which focuses on grade 3-4
toxicities occurring only during the first treatment cycle,
was designed for conventional chemotherapy. Therefore,
it may not be appropriate for non-cytotoxic agents for
which late, different or lower grade toxicities also deserve
attention [29]. As recently highlighted by Paoletti et al.
[30], DLT assessment should take into account also lower
grade toxicities that lead to significant RDI decrease and
that may also occur after the first treatment cycle. The
design of phase 1 trials to assess non-cytotoxic agents
should allow for precise dose adjustments to achieve >
75% RDI. In our study, the 3+3 standard escalation scheme
was clearly inappropriate because many grade 3 cutaneous
toxicities occurred during the phase 1 part (> 50% of
patients). These events led to a significant RDI decrease
for both targeted therapies, but could not be considered
as DLTs. These compliance issues were confirmed by the
phase 2 study. Specifically, nine patients discontinued
the treatment due to cutaneous toxicity, although disease
was stabilized. Moreover, such cutaneous adverse events
might be more frequent and severe in patients who are
concomitantly treated with two targeted therapies to block
both HER1 and HER2 [31,32]. Therefore, extra care
should be taken when moving from preclinical to clinical
settings, for example by starting with lower doses than
those used when these compounds are used individually.
Finally, the correlation between response or survival
and severity of cutaneous adverse events, as observed in
our study, has already been reported. For instance, the
erlotinib-gemcitabine combination, which showed some

Discussion
This phase 1-2 trial confirms the feasibility of
combining cetuximab and trastuzumab for the treatment
of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
after first-line chemotherapy failure. However, the
primary objective of a 5% to 20% response rate was not
achieved because no complete or partial response could
be observed, but only prolonged stable disease in nine
patients with grade 3-4 cutaneous toxicities. Although the
results of this trial are negative based on its initial design,
several lessons can be drawn from our observations.
First, the absence of complete or partial response
could lead to question the anticancer activity of combined
CET-TRA. Indeed, antibodies targeting HER1 or HER2

efficacy improvement compared to the individual drugs
in patients with pancreatic cancer, was associated with
increased toxicity [8]. In a retrospective study, 168 patients
with pancreatic cancer and treated with combined erlotinib
and gemcitabine were classified in two groups (high and
low severity), based on the rash intensity [33]. The high
severity group had longer median OS and PFS than the
low severity group (both P<0.05); patients suffering from
particularly severe rash also had a lower risk of death
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, P<0.05). Likewise, in a phase 2
trial that enrolled patients with metastatic pancreatic
cancer (n=64) treated with chemotherapy + CET, the
presence of a rash was significantly correlated with OS
[34]. Moreover, as this efficacy-toxicity association had
been described also in patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC), Van Cutsem et al. (34) conducted the EVEREST
trial in 157 patients who experienced grade ≤ 1 skin
reactions following standard-dose CET. These patients
were randomly assigned to receive weekly standarddose or dose-escalated CET (500 mg/m²) [35]. This dose
escalation was associated with increased skin toxicity,
but also with improved response rate and disease control
rate. A second trial conducted by the same group is in
progress to determine whether administering escalating
doses of cetuximab in patients with no early skin toxicity
could delay the progression of the disease in a significant
proportion of patients and to study the molecular
signatures of response (NCT01251536). Similarly, in a
phase 2 randomized trial in patients with metastatic CRC
treated with CET, occurrence of grade 2-3 skin toxicities
(compared with grade 0-1) was correlated with improved
outcome, including better overall response rate, PFS and
OS [36]. The authors also highlighted the independence of
this effect from the KRAS mutation status and suggested
that patients’ constitutional factors were possibly involved
in the relationship between response to CET and skin
toxicity. Concerning the underlying mechanism, as EGFR
is involved in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis,
EGFR inhibitors will target also normal epithelial cells.
Takata et al. [37] suggested that they might particularly
affect cell differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes
and sebaceous glands. Moreover, EGFR and HER2
dimerization status could explain the different type of
toxicity induced by EGFR-targeted vs HER2-targeted
therapies [38]. Finally, another study assessed the safety
and efficacy of everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, which
is downstream of HER1 and HER2 [39]. However,
because of toxicity (mainly cutaneous), the recommended
dose could not be determined in this phase 1-2 trial. In
view of all these data, future clinical investigations need to
include both cutaneous and tumor biopsies as they might
help understanding whether and how the mechanism of
action and efficacy of EGFR targeted therapies is linked
to dose-limiting cutaneous reactions.
In conclusion, although this phase 1-2 trial did
not bring the expected efficacy results for the treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of advanced pancreatic cancer, one can learn from our
observations. Conventional phase 1 dose-escalation
schedules are clearly not appropriate for targeted therapy
evaluation as most of the induced cutaneous toxicities are
not considered as DLTs. However, they often entail dose
reduction or treatment interruption, which is particularly
detrimental because such toxicities have been positively
correlated with response to treatment.

Statement of translational relevance
As HER family members are involved in pancreatic
carcinoma and are activated through dimerization, we
tested the combination of cetuximab (anti-EGFR/HER1)
and trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody). Following
promising preclinical results, the aim of this phase 1-2
trial was to determine the trastuzumab recommended
dose and to assess the combination safety and efficacy.
Nine patients out of 39 were stabilized, but stopped the
treatment because of toxicity. The frequency and severity
of cutaneous toxicities were correlated with survival,
but also caused treatment compliance issues. Our study
demonstrates that the conventional phase 1 design and
the associated definition of dose-limiting toxicities are
inappropriate for the evaluation of targeted therapy-based
regimens, especially when directed against HER1/2.
Cutaneous toxicities, which are not considered as doselimiting, should be taken into account for future doseescalation studies to evaluate the potential of anti-HER
antibody combinations. Investigation of the underlying
mechanisms might help understanding this significant
toxicity-efficacy correlation.

Patients and Methods
Study design and patients
We designed a phase 1-2, open-label, singlearm, non-randomized, multicenter trial. The study
protocol was approved by our local ethics committee,
the French competent authorities, and our Institutional
Gastrointestinal Review Board. The study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice. Written informed consent has been
obtained from all patients before entering the study. The
phase 1 study was only performed in Montpellier, while
seven French centers participated in the phase 2 trial.
Patients with histologically documented, unresectable
pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled (Fig. 1). The
other eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.

Phase 1 trial

Ancillary study

The phase 1 trial included two consecutive cohorts
corresponding to the two TRA dose levels (Fig. 1). Both
cohorts received weekly intravenous CET at a loading dose
of 400 mg/m² (day 1, week 1, 90-minute infusion) and then
at 250 mg/m² (30-minute infusion). Dose escalation was
provided for TRA only, which was administered 1 hour
after the end of the CET infusion. A standard 3+3 dose
escalation design with three to six patients per dose level
was used. Patients in the first cohort received 3.0 mg/kg
TRA as loading dose (day 1, week 1, 90-minute infusion)
followed by 1.5 mg/kg TRA the following weeks
(30-minute infusion). If the tolerance was acceptable in
this first cohort, the second cohort (second dose level)
received 4.0 mg/kg TRA (loading dose) the first week and
then 2.0 mg/kg TRA. A treatment cycle was defined as
four weeks of treatment. The phase 1 primary endpoint
was the recommended dose of TRA defined as the dose
for which one type of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
occurred at most in 33% of patients during the first two
treatment cycles. Adverse events were graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. DLT
was defined as any grade 4 toxicity (except for alopecia,
or vomiting in the absence of adequate prophylaxis),
fever or sepsis concurrent with grade 3-4 neutropenia,
symptomatic thrombocytopenia (hemorrhage), any grade 3
cardiotoxicity and any toxicity requiring a treatment delay
longer than 15 days. Treatment was to be administered for
six complete cycles or until disease progression, patient
refusal or unacceptable toxicity.

An optional ancillary study assessed the predictive
value of individual biomarkers, such as KRAS mutations,
HER1 and HER2 expression, and Fcγ receptor
polymorphisms (FcγRIIA-H131R and FcγRIIIA-V158F).
Expression of HER1 and HER2 in surgical specimens
was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, as previously
described [23]. KRAS mutations in tumor tissues
were determined by high resolution melt analysis and
direct sequencing [24]. Polymorphism genotyping was
performed, as previously described [25].

Statistical methods
Three to 12 patients (3 to 6 per cohort) were planned
for the phase 1 study. For the phase 2 study, 24 to 55
patients were required assuming a Simon’s optimal twostage design with α=5% and β=10%. The minimal ORR
value was estimated at 5% and treatment was considered
promising if ORR ≥ 20%.
PFS was calculated from inclusion until disease
progression or death. Patients alive without progression
were censored at the time of the last contact. OS was
calculated from inclusion until death. Patients alive or lost
to follow-up were censored at the time of the last contact.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS
and OS. A p-value of 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
number NCT00923299.

Cancer Clinical Trials (CTD-INCa). This work was
supported by the program “Investissement d’avenir” grant
agreement: Labex MabImprove, ANR-10-LABX-53-01.

After completion of the phase 1 part, the phase 2
trial assessed the CET and TRA combination according
to the recommended dose defined based on the phase 1
results. Adverse events were managed as in phase 1. The
phase 2 primary endpoint was the objective response rate
(ORR). Every four weeks, target lesions were assessed by
independent review of thorax-abdomen-pelvis computed
tomography scans according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0 [22]. The
tumor response had to be confirmed by two consecutive
assessments separated by a four-week interval. Secondary
endpoints were the tolerance profile, progression-free
survival (PFS) and OS. Routine laboratory tests were done
weekly during the first two cycles and every two weeks
afterwards; physical examination was performed before
each treatment.
