ABSTRACT
The synthetic curcumin analog B5 is a potent inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase
(TrxR) that has potential anticancer effects. The molecular mechanism underlying
B5 as an anticancer agent is not yet fully understood. In this study, we report that
B5 induces apoptosis in two human cervical cancer cell lines, CaSki and SiHa, as
evidenced by the downregulation of XIAP, activation of caspases and cleavage of
PARP. The involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in B5-induced apoptosis was
suggested by the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased
expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In B5-treated cells, TrxR activity
was markedly inhibited with concomitant accumulation of oxidized thioredoxin,
increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of ASK1 and
its downstream regulatory target p38/JNK. B5-induced apoptosis was significantly
inhibited in the presence of N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Microscopic examination of B5-treated
cells revealed increased presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles. The ability of B5 to activate
autophagy in cells was subsequently confirmed by cell staining with acridine orange,
accumulation of LC3-II, and measurement of autophagic flux. Unlike B5-induced
apoptosis, autophagy induced by B5 is not ROS-mediated but a role for the AKT and
AMPK signaling pathways is implied. In SiHa cells but not CaSki cells, B5-induced
apoptosis was promoted by autophagy. These data suggest that the anticarcinogenic
effects of B5 is mediated by complex interplay between cellular mechanisms governing
redox homeostasis, apoptosis and autophagy.

INTRODUCTION

28.3 μM in CaSki cells. In SiHa cells, the IC50 values were
5.3 and 18.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 1B). These results
show that B5 is relatively more cytotoxic towards cancer
cells than natural curcumin.

The thioredoxin (Trx) system, composed of
thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), Trx, and NADPH, is a major
cellular redox control mechanism that is often deregulated
in malignancy [1]. The Trx system has special significance
in tumor biology as tumor cells are often subject to
oxidative stress arising from the tumor environment [2] and
increased consumption of reducing equivalents to support
DNA synthesis [3, 4]. The Trx system may be involved
in carcinogenesis in several ways. Firstly, it can promote
cancer cell proliferation through its modulatory effect on
redox-regulated transcription factors and/or protein kinase
signaling cascades [5]. Secondly, the Trx system is needed
for the activity of peroxiredoxins [6], which are ubiquitously
expressed antioxidant enzymes that scavenge reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [7, 8] and the direct inhibition of
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) [9], a mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK)
that activates the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways. As a
result, tumor cells usually have higher resistance against
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [10]. Thirdly, the Trx
system has also been implicated in tumor angiogenesis [11]
through the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [12], and
the Trx-dependentheme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway
[13]. Fourthly, high levels of Trx expression are associated
with tumor invasion and metastasis. Thus, Trx promotes
matrix metalloproteinase activity and stimulates cancer
cell invasion [14]. Trx over expression is linked to tumor
metastasis [15] and is implicated in malignant potential
of tumor cells [1]. Indeed, Trx levels are upregulated in
the plasma of cancerpatients [16] and a high Trx level is
often correlated with cancer resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents [17–20]. Thus, the Trx system may represent an
important therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
TrxR is a ubiquitously expressed selenocysteine
(Sec)-containing oxidoreductase that catalyzes the
NADPH-dependent reduction of Trx [21]. In our previous
study, B5 as one of the synthetic curcumin analogs with
structure shown in Figure 1A was found to potently inhibit
TrxR by covalent modification of Cys497 and Sec498
[22]. However, the potential anticancer effects of B5 have
not been examined. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the mechanisms of action of this TrxR inhibitor
in two human cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and SiHa.

B5 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
CaSki and SiHa cells
To study the mechanism underlying the inhibitory
effects of B5 on cancer cell growth, cell-cycle analysis was
performed for B5-treated CaSki and SiHa cells by flow
cytometry. The treatment of cells with B5 (16 μM) resulted
in an increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phases
by18% and 10% respectively in the CaSki and SiHa cells
when compared to the controls. A similar increase in the
percentage of G2/M cells was again observed after treating
the cells with B5 at 32 μM (Fig. 2A).
Whether the treatment of cells with B5 would also
result in apoptosis was next examined. Cells were stained
with a mixture of Annexin-V-FITC/PI followed by flow
cytometry analysis. B5 at 16 and 32 μM caused readily
detectable cell death to occur in both cell lines as evident
by the presence of cells stained positively with Annexin
V-FITC only (early apoptotic) or Annexin-V-FITC/PI (late
apopotic). In the CaSki cells, B5 at 16 and 32 μM caused
a small but distinct increase in the percentage of early
apoptotic cells. By contrast, a rather large increase in the
percentage of late apoptotic cells amounting to 58.7% and
60.5% respectively at 16 and 32 μM of B5 was observed.
Similarly, more late than early apoptotic cells were
formed in B5-treated SiHa cells. At B5 concentrations
of 16 and 32 μM, the percentage late apoptotic cells was
approximately double that of the untreated control.
We next analyzed the effect of B5 on the activation
of caspases and expression of XIAP. Western blotting
analysis showed that B5 induced the activation of
caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9. Consistent with the
activation of caspases, the caspase 3 substrate PARP was
found to undergo specific proteolytic cleavage as suggested
by the presence of the 116 kDa to 89 kDa fragment in
cells treated with B5 at 4, 16 and 32 μM in CaSki cells.
In the case for SiHa cells, an increase in the abundance
of the 89 kDa PARP fragment could readily be seen in
cells treated with B5 at 32 μM (Fig. 2C). In addition, B5
treatment downregulated the expression of XIAP (Fig. 2C),
which is considered the most potent human IAP protein
currently identified because it inhibits the activity of both
caspase 3 and caspase 9 [23, 24]. These results suggest that
caspases activation may underlie the apoptotic activity of
B5 in cervical cancer cells.

SiHa cells

B5 induces mitochondrial dysfunction and
regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins

The effect of B5 and on cellular viability in
comparison to curcumin was examined in the Caski and
SiHa human cervical cancer cells. In MTT assay, the IC50
values of B5 and curcumin were respectively 6.1 and

A distinctive feature of the early phase apoptosis is
a change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) [25]

that is an important parameter of mitochondrial function.
The Δψm is an early event preceding caspase activation,
and is regarded as a hallmark of apoptosis [26].
Therefore, we measured Δψm in B5-treated CaSki and
SiHa cells using the membrane-permeable JC-1 dye. In
apoptotic or unhealthy cells with low Δψm, JC-1 remains
in the monomeric form, which has green fluorescence
[27]. As shown in Fig. 3B, a marked increase in JC-1related green fluorescence can be seen in both the CaSki
and SiHa cells treated with 16 or 32 μM of B5. These
results demonstrate that B5 induced MMP disruption in
both cell lines.
Mitochondrion-mediated intrinsic apoptotic
pathway occurs in response to various stimuli, including
oxidative stress, and is regulated by the proteins of
the Bcl-2 family [28, 29]. In this study, we found that
B5 induced downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL,
upregulation of proapoptotic Bid/Bok, and activation
of Bim cleavage in CaSki cells (Fig. 3A). However,
the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was not affected by
B5 (data not shown). These results indicate that B5
induces apoptosis of cancer cells through induction of

mitochondrial dysfunction caused by deregulation of
Bcl-2 family proteins.

Effect of B5 on ROS generation
ROS have important roles in intracellular signal
transduction and redox homeostasis [30]. However,
excessive ROS accumulation can exert toxic effects
and cause oxidative stress, damaging main cellular
components such as DNA, lipids, and proteins [31]
and causing apoptosis [32]. To investigate whether
B5-induced apoptosis was related to the changes
in intracellular redox environment, we examined
intracellular ROS production in B5-treated cervical
cancer cells using DCFH-DA. As shown in Fig.  4A,
B5 caused ROS accumulation in CaSki and SiHa cells,
especially after the treatment for 3 and 2 h, respectively.
The pre-treatment of NAC, a ROS scavenger, reduced
B5-induced apoptosis by 10.5% and 13.4%, respectively
(Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that ROS
accumulation plays an important role in B5-induced cell
apoptosis.

Effect of B5 on the Trx system

showed that B5 induced the release of ASK1 from the
complex with Trx (Fig. 6A). The increased presence
of free ASK1 was also indicated by the activation of
downstream MAPK signaling pathways mediated by
ASK1: the phosphorylation level of p38 and JNK MAPKs
notably increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6B),
suggesting activation of these kinases in CaSki and SiHa
cells after B5 treatment.

We next examined B5 effects on the Trx system.
SC-TrxR assay showed that B5 inhibited TrxR activity
dose-dependently in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). Interestingly,
the expression level of Trx was increased in both cell lines,
whereas that of TrxR was increased in SiHa cells but
decreased in CaSki cells (Fig. 5B). This result was further
verified by the RT-PCR assay: B5 upregulated Trx mRNA
in both cell lines, while TrxR mRNA was upregulated only
in SiHa cells (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the oxidized Trx
form was increased while the reduced form was decreased
dose-dependently in both cell lines after the treatment
with B5 (Fig. 5D). Together, these results indicate that B5
deregulates the Trx system in cancer cells.

B5 induces autophagy in cervical cancer cells
It is unclear whether autophagy in dying cells is the
cause of cell death or is actually an attempt to prevent it.
Autophagy-related cell death has been defined as a form
of programmed cell death [33]. The treatment with 16 μM
B5 for 48 h induced autophagy in CaSki and SiHa cells,
as demonstrated by the presence of autophagic vacuoles
by electron microscopy (Fig. 7A). To confirm B5-induced
autophagy, acridine orange, a lysosome marker dye,
was used to stain CaSki and SiHa cells [34]. As shown
in Fig. 7B, B5 induced the accumulation of acridine
orange in cytoplasm of CaSki and SiHa cells, while less
accumulation of acridine orange was observed in control

Effect of B5 treatment on the MAPK signaling in
cervical cancer cells
The inhibition of TrxR activity should result in the
shift of Trx redox state to the oxidized form (Fig.  5C)
and dissociation of ASK1 from the complex with
Trx [10]. In our study, co-immunoprecipitation assay

cells. Furthermore, B5 also induced accumulation of
LC3-II (Fig. 7D), a lipidated form of LC3 that is regarded
as an autophagosomal marker in mammals. To obtain
further confirmation of autophagy, autophagic flux was
measured in terms of alteration of LC3-II and SQSTM1/
p62 levels in the presence and absence of specific
lysosomal inhibitors BAF and CQ that act to prevent
autophagosomal lysosome degradation [35]. As shown in
Fig. 7D, BAF or CQ treatment resulted in accumulation
of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 both in CaSki and SiHa
cells. The accumulation of LC3-II was increased and that
of SQSTM1/p62 was decreased with the combination of
inhibitors with B5. These results suggest that B5 induces
autophagy in cervical cancer cells.
The AKT-mediated signaling cascade is one of
the main signaling pathways regulating autophagy
[36]. Figure 8A showed that the phosphorylation level
of AKT was declined after B5 treatment, suggesting
the involvement of the AKT signaling in B5-induced
autophagy. The energy sensor AMPK has recently

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been connected to autophagy [37]. Interestingly, the
phosphorylation level of AMPK was promoted in
SiHa cells, but it was suppressed in CaSki cells with
B5 treatment (Fig. 8A). A complex role of AMPK in
B5-mediated autophagy in cervical cancer cell lines is
implied. TORC1 is a downstream regulatory target of
AKT and AMPK and it usually acts as an autophagysuppressive regulator. TORC1 activity can be followed by
the phosphorylation of its substrate 4E-BP1 [35, 38]. As
shown in Fig. 8A, the phosphorylation level of 4E-BP1
was decreased in both cell lines upon treatment with B5.
A growing amount of evidences in recent years
demonstrate that ROS represent important mediators
of autophagy [39]. To investigate the role of ROS
in B5-inducd autophagy, CaSki and SiHa cells were
pretreated with NAC prior to B5 treatment. As shown in
Fig. 8B, LC3-II accumulation was not affected by NAC,
suggesting that B5-mediated autophagy induction was
independent on B5-caused ROS production in cervical
cancer cells.

Effect of B5-induced autophagy on B5-triggered
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells

induced by the combination of B5 and 3-MA. The
results indicate that B5-induced autophagy indeed had
an apoptosis-promoting effect but only in SiHa cells
(Fig. 9B bottom).
It has been reported that 3-MA might also inhibit
PI3K and can thus promote autophagy in some systems
as well as affect cell survival [41]. Another autophagy
inhibitor CQ was therefore used to further examine the
involvement of autophagy in B5-triggered apoptosis by
MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis. As shown in
Fig. 9C and 9D, CQ prevented the growth inhibitory effect
of B5 and attenuated B5-triggered apoptosis in SiHa cells.
However, no obvious changes of growth and apoptosis
were observed in CaSki cells when B5 was combined

To explore whether B5-induced autophagy had
a protective or detrimental effect, CaSki and SiHa
cells were pre-cultured with two different autophagy
inhibitors, 3-MA and CQ, respectively, before the
treatment of B5. The MTT assay indicated that 3-MA,
a commonly used inhibitor of starvation or rapamycininduced autophagy [40], prevented the inhibitory effect
of B5 on the growth of SiHa cell lines (Fig. 9A right),
suggesting that B5-induced autophagy may have an
apoptosis-promoting effect. To verify this hypothesis,
flow cytometry was used to analyze cellular apoptosis

byproducts of metabolism and have important roles in
cell signaling and homeostasis. However, excessive
ROS generation can damage cell structures and cause
oxidative stress and cell death [31]. In our experiments,
B5 induced time-dependent ROS accumulation (Fig. 4A)
suppression in TrxR activity and increase in the oxidized
Trx form (Fig. 5A and 5D) in cancer cells; furthermore,
the ROS scavenger NAC reduced B5-elicited apoptosis
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that B5-dependent disruption of the
Trx system and excessive ROS accumulation underlie
the proapoptotic activity of B5. It should be noted that a
decrease of ROS level was observed in CaSki and SiHa
cells after the treatment of B5 for 4 and 3 h, respectively.
It may be that some cellular antioxidant proteins, such
as peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase,
participated in preventing the buildup of intracellular
ROS [59].
MAPK signaling pathways are closely involved
in the response to oxidative stress [60]. JNK and p38
MAPKs play important roles in regulating H2O2-induced
cell death and are critical mediators of oxidative stressinduced apoptosis [61, 62]. The binding of reduced Trx
to the upstream kinase ASK1 can block JNK and p38
activity; however, when Trx is oxidized, the complex
dissociates and the released ASK1 activates the JNK and
p38 pathways, thereby promoting apoptosis. Our results
show that B5 treatment causes ASK1 dissociation from the
complex with Trx in SiHa cells (Fig. 6A) and activation of
JNK and p38 MAPKs (Fig. 6B), suggesting that MAPK
pathway may be involved in B5-induced apoptosis. The
more detailed role of MAPK pathway in B5-induced
apoptosis and the relationship between B5-mediated ROS
production and MAPKs signal transduction are worthy of
further investigation.
Although autophagy can be upregulated in many
tumor cells under stress conditions such as chemotherapy
or nutrient deficiency, the exact role of autophagy in
cancer cell death is still not clear [63, 64]. After short-term
stressful effects, autophagy activation generally facilitates
the restoration of cell homeostasis and survival. However,
under permanent adverse conditions, autophagy is induced
to promote elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis [33].
Here, we investigated the association between apoptosis
and autophagy in cervical cancer cells treated with the
combination of B5 and the autophagy inhibitors. The
reduction in autophagy relieved B5 inhibitory effect on
cell growth (Fig. 9A and 9C), which is verified by Annexin
V-FITC/PI staining analysis in SiHa cells (Fig. 9B and 9D),
suggesting a crosstalk between B5-induced apoptosis
and autophagy in SiHa cells. However, the treatment of
autophagy inhibitors, both 3-MA and CQ, had no effect on
B5-induced apoptosis in CaSki cells (Fig. 9), suggesting
different signaling pathways may be involved in
B5-mediated autophagy in CaSki and SiHa cell lines.
Indeed, in this study, we found that AKT signaling,
one of the main signaling pathways regulating autophagy,

DISCUSSION
The mammalian TrxR is a Sec-containing
oxidoreductase that has been established as an anticancer
drug target [4, 42, 43] because of its role as a key player
in cell death program [44]. The highly reactive Sec active
site with low pKa value and easily accessible location
makes this enzyme a suitable target for drug development.
In the past decades, many therapeutically used synthetic
and natural compounds with TrxR inhibitory activity
have been found to exhibit anticancer potential [45].
Among them, gold compounds [46], platinum drugs [47],
flavonoids [48], quinines [49], mercury [50], arsenic
trioxide [51], curcumin [52] and its analogs [22] have been
tested as novel cancer treatments or adjuncts to existing
therapy; some of them have shown potent therapeutic
effects [53]. In the present study, we demonstrated that
B5, a newly synthesized TrxR inhibitor and a curcumin
analog, exhibited significant antitumor activity based
on the modulation of the intracellular redox status and
autophagy (Fig. 10).
Mitochondria plays a very important role as the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway [54]. The key event of
mitochondrion-induced apoptosis is the permeabilization
of the OMM, which occurs in response to various stimuli
and is mainly regulated by the members of the Bcl-2
family [28, 29]. Indeed, we found that B5 decreased Δψm
in CaSki and SiHa cells (Fig. 3B) and downregulated the
expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL while upregulating that
of proapoptotic Bid/Bok (Fig. 3A), indicating that the loss
of Δψm plays an important role in B5-induced apoptosis in
cervical cancer cells.
MMP loss is an early event preceding caspase
activation, which causes the leakage of small molecules,
such as cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived
activator of caspases (Smac), from the mitochondria
into the cytoplasm [55], followed by the (a) recruitment
of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and
procaspase9 to form the apoptosome [56], (b) activation
of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and (c) execution of apoptosis
[57]. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family negatively
regulates this process, and the most potent human IAP
protein XIAP inhibits the activity of both caspase 9 and
caspase 3 [58]. Our data demonstrate that B5 induced
the activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in CaSki and SiHa
cells (Fig. 2C) and downregulated the expression of XIAP
(Fig. 2C), indicating that B5 induced apoptosis in cancer
cells through the intrinsic as well as extrinsic apoptotic
pathways as evidenced by the activation of caspase 8 [43].

accumulation of ROS. In healthy cells, ROS are natural

was inconsistently inhibited in CaSki and SiHa cells
(Fig. 8A). Although the phosphorylation level of AKT
was inhibited markedly at high concentration (32 μM)
of B5 in both cell lines, it was hardly reduced by 16
μM B5 in SiHa cells in spite of autophagy induction
under the treatment of this concentration, indicating the
involvement of some other pathway(s) in the regulation of
B5-induced autophagy in SiHa cells. Herein AMPK was
found to one of the possible regulators. There is mouting
evidence that AMPK activates autophagy through
inactivation of TORC1 and direct phosphorylation of
the protein kinase ULK1 [37]. Our results in Figure 8A
that the phosphorylation level of AMPK was elevated
dramatically by B5 in SiHa cells suggests that B5 may
induce autophagy in SiHa cells through coordinated
regulation of AKT and AMPK followed by the
suppression of TORC1, whose activity was monitored by
the decreased phosphorylation level of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 8A),
a substrate of TORC1. It is interesting to note that some
unexpected result was observed in CaSki cells, namely
the level of phosphorylated AMPK was decreased, which
was inconsistent with that of SiHa cells. It may be that
more complex network of regulation are involved in B5mediated autophagy in CaSki cells since the activation of
AMPK crucially depends on phosphorylation by multiple
upstream kinases, like LKB1, CaMKK, TAK1, etc [65].
The detailed roles of the regulation network in B5mediatd autophagy and crosstalks and feedbacks between
B5-induced apoptosis and autophagy remain to be further
explored.
In summary, we demonstrated that B5 activated
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells via suppression of
Trx system and functional disruption of mitochondria.
The accumulation of the oxidized Trx would cause ROS
accumulation and affect a number of Trx-dependent
pathways, including those of ASK1, JNK and p38
MAPKs, which may contribute to B5-induced apoptosis.
B5 also promoted apoptosis by induction of autophagy,
which might involve the inhibition of the Akt signaling
and was independent of ROS (Fig. 10). Our results
show that B5 is a more efficient anticancer agent
than curcumin in vitro and warrants further in vivo
investigation. Our data provide important information
for the explanation of the anticancer activity of
curcumin analogs and for the development of new
curcumin analogs targeting TrxR with high activity
against cancer cells.

Growth inhibition assay
Growth inhibition of cancer cells by B5 was
measured by the MTT assay. Exponentially grown
CaSki and SiHa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the
density of 5 × 103 cells per well in complete medium and
allowed to attach for about 12 h. Cells were then treated
with a range of B5 concentrations for 48h. The medium
was removed, and 50 μl of the same medium containing
5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well for another 4 h.
After medium removal, 100 μl DMSO was added to
each well for 10 min. Cell viability was assessed by the
absorbance at 570 nm and measured using a microplate
reader (BIO-RAD, USA); IC50 values of B5 for each
cell line were determined by comparison with untreated
control cells.

For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts (according
to protein content) of cell lysates prepared as above
were incubated with Trx1 antibody immobilized on
protein A  magnetic beads (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at
4°C overnight. The pellet was washed five times with
ice-cold NP40 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China); proteins
were extracted with SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by
immunoblotting with Trx1 and ASK1 antibodies.

Determination of ROS production
CaSki and SiHa cells (2 × 105) were seeded in
60-mm Petri dishes. After the treatment with 16 μM B5
for 1–4 h, cells were incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA
for 15 min in the dark, washed three times with ice-cold
PBS, and seeded in 96-well NUNC plates (Thermo, USA)
at the density of 5 × 103 per well; DCFH-DA fluorescence

F500, Switzerland).

TrxR activity analysis in cells
TrxR activity in cervical cancer cells was determined
by SC-TrxR assay as described by Cunniff et al [67].
Cells were incubated with different concentrations of
B5 for 48 h. Cells were harvested and cell lysates were
prepared as described above in the presence of protease
inhibitors. Protein concentrations of the supernatants
were determined by Bradford reagent. 25 μg of extract
was incubated with 1 mM NADPH and 2 mM SC in TE
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) in a
total volume of 100 μl. Samples of protein only, protein
and NADPH, and protein and SC were used as controls,
respectively. The reaction mixture was placed into 96-well
microplates and monitored in 30-s intervals over a 20-min
time period at 340 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad,
USA). TrxR activity was expressed as mol NADPH
consumed/min.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis
CaSki and SiHa cells (2 × 105) were seeded in
60-mm Petri dishes at 1 day before the experiment.
After the treatment with 16 μM B5 for 48 h, cells were
harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended
in 70% Karnovsky’s fixative, and incubated for 20 min
at room temperature. Ultrathin slices were prepared and
examined under Hitachi 7000 transmission electron
microscope (Tokyo, Japan).

Acridine orange staining
CaSki and SiHa cells were treated as described
in transmission electron microscopy analysis. After
harvesting, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
and incubated with 1 μg/ml acridine orange for 15 min at
37°C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with
ice-cold PBS and then observed under a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus IX71, Japan).
