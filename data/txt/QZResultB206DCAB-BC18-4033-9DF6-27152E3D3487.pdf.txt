ABSTRACT:

	
Background:
Metronomic
chemotherapy
(MC)
is
defined
as
the
frequent
administration
of
chemotherapy
at
doses
below
the
maximal tolerated dose and with no prolonged drug-free break. MC
is gaining interest as an alternative strategy to fight resistant cancer.
	
Objective: to assess the safety of 4 drug MC regimen in
pediatric patients with refractory or relapsing various tumors types.
	
Setting: From November 2008 to December 2010, in three academic
pediatric oncology centers, 16 children (median age 12 years old; range 5.5-20)
were included in this pilot study. This treatment was proposed to children with
refractory disease for whom no further effective treatments were available. Most
frequent diagnosis were medulloblastoma/cerebral PNET (5) osteosarcoma (5),
and one case each of nephroblastoma, high grade glioma, Hodgkin lymphoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and kidney rhabdoid tumour. The MC
regimen consisted in cycles of 56 days (8 weeks) with weekly vinblastine 3 mg/
m² (week 1-7), daily cyclophosphamide 30 mg/m² (days 1-21), and twice weekly
methotrexate 10 mg/m² (days 21-42), and daily celecoxib 100 mg to 400 mg twice
daily (days1-56) followed by a 2-weeks chemotherapy break. Adverse events
were determined through laboratory analysis and investigator observations.
	
Results: One objective response was observed in a patient with
Hodgkin lymphoma, and 4 patients experienced disease stabilization and
continued their treatment for 3 cycles (24 weeks) or more. At last follow-up, 7
patients (43%) are alive including 1 still undergoing treatment. During the
overall 36 cycles of treatments received by patients, 4 grade IV toxicities and
24 grade III toxicities were observed in 11 cycles in only 10 different patients.
	
Conclusion: The metronomic regimen we report here was well
tolerated and associated with disease stabilization. This regimen is
currently being evaluated in a national multicenter phase II study.

INTRODUCTION

frequent administration of chemotherapy drugs at doses

prolonged drug-free breaks [1]. MC has been reported

to significantly reduce adverse events (AEs) usually
associated with chemotherapy. Although clinical data
of MC in pediatric oncology remains sparse [1, 2], this
approach may be well suited and represents a genuine
alternative solution for children with poor prognosis or
refractory disease [3, 4], potentially as a maintenance
therapy following multimodal treatment [5]. Furthermore,
its low cost and limited toxicity make MC a very attractive
therapeutic option in low- and middle-income countries
[6, 7].
Here, we aimed at developing a new multidrug
metronomic protocol for children, integrating the different
mechanisms of action of MC. Indeed, although MC had
initially been considered to be an anti-angiogenic therapy
[8], recent findings have highlighted new effects, which
all likely contribute to treatment efficacy [1]. These effects
include the stimulation of the anticancer properties of the
immune system, re-induction of tumor dormancy as well
as potential direct effects against cancer cells [1, 9].
The potential of etoposide and temozolomide used
in a metronomic fashion has already been reported [3,
4, 5, 10]. However, since potential mutagenic effects,
including myelodysplasia and secondary leukemias, were
reported with these agents when administered at more
conventional dosing [11, 12], they were not included in this
study. Instead, we designed a metronomic regimen relying
mainly on oral medications and used a continuous lowdose methotrexate (MTX) / low-dose cyclophosphamide
backbone published in 2002 by Colleoni et al. [13].
Lower doses of cyclophosphamide were used to avoid
high hematologic toxicities since cyclophosphomide was
combined with others anticancer agents. Vinblastine,
which had already been included in metronomic protocols
[14, 15], was also added to our protocol. This drug only
adds little hematological toxicity at the dosage of 3mg/
m² and microtubule-targeting agents are known to be the

most potent Anti-angiogenic chemotherapeutics so far
[16,17] and bring potential beneficial immunologic effect
[18]. Lastly, celecoxib has been added as a 4th agent in this
metronomic combination. Celecoxib has been part of most
pediatric metronomic regimen [3, 4, 5, 10, 14] as it adds
potential anti-angiogenic effect and tumor sensitization
to chemotherapy [19] and very limited toxicity. Here, we
report of a pilot study of a 4 drug metronomic regimen in
children with relapsing, refractory solid tumors.

PATIENTS AND PROTOCOL
This pilot study evaluated the use of MC with
cycles consisting of weekly intravenous vinblastine
3 mg/m2 (week 1 to 6 (later changed to 7 see below)),
daily oral cyclophosphamide 30 mg/m2 (days 1-21), twice
weekly oral MTX 15 mg/m² (then lowered to 10 mg/m²
see below) (days 21-42), and twice daily oral celecoxib
100-400 mg (days 1-42), followed by a 2-week therapy
break (celecoxib was then kept during the break see
below). All families gave consent before enrollment of
the patients in the study. This treatment was proposed to
children, aged from 3 to 21 years old, with refractory or
relapsing cancer following treatment protocols available
in our institutions, or to patients who were not eligible
for phase I or II trials. All patients with an uncontrolled
concurrent illness, active infection or unable to swallow
oral medication were excluded from the study. Adverse
events (AEs) were determined through laboratory analyses
and investigator observations and grade using the NCICTC 3.0 criteria. Treatment was terminated upon tumor
progression, following physician’s decision, according
to parent’s will or due to unacceptable toxicity. Tumor
size was evaluated using bidimensional measurement.

(progressive disease: 25% increase, stable disease: neither
partial response nor PD criteria met, partial response: at
least 50% decrease and complete response: disappearance
of all known lesion(s)).
From November 2008 to December 2010, 16 patients
were included in this study, with a median age of 12 years
old (5.5-20 years). There were 11 boys and 5 girls. Details
of the study population and outcomes are reported in table
1.
The treatment plan was slightly modified after
treatment of the first 3 patients upon toxicity and clinical
outcome. Thus, and following disease progression
-suggesting active neo-angiogenesis during chemotherapy
break-, it was decided to continue celecoxib administration
between two cycles. A seventh vinblastine administration
was also added on day 42. Then, as oral mucositis
occurred during the second part of the cycle during which
patients were taking oral methotrexate and celecoxib,
methotrexate dosage was diminished from 15 mg/m² to
10 mg/m². Overall, 10 out of the 16 patients received the
last implemented version of the regimen.

was noted in 4 patients (25%) who did not complete
the first cycle of treatment. When comparing time to
progression (TTP) while receiving the experimental
metronomic regimen with TTP during the previous line
of treatment [20,21], we found that TTP obtained with the
experimental MC was longer in 8 patients (50%) (see table
1). However, overall there was no statistically significant
difference between TTPs for respectively previous and
current metronomic treatment (means 12.5 vs 17.1 weeks;
Wilcoxon test, p=0.35).
Of particular interest, in 11 patients a decrease in pain
and antalgic drug administration was rapidly observed
after initiation of the metronomic treatment.
Most importantly, according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0, with 24 gradeIII and only 4 grade-IV AEs, tolerability was acceptable.
They were mainly hematological (83 % of toxicities
and 75% of children). Six patients did not display
any grade III or IV toxicities. It may be worthwhile to
note that 4 of the patients (those with prior high dose
chemotherapy followed by hematologic peripheral stem
cell transplantation) accounted for 50% of all the AEs. No
alopecia was reported and in all children except 1 who
previously received high-dose chemotherapy, normal
hair growth was noted. No grade III or IV nausea or
vomiting was observed. Details are given in table 2. No
patients stopped their treatment as a result of toxicity.
Vinblastine dosage had to be reduced by 30% in 3 patients
because of peripheral neurotoxicity (1 patient) and severe
hematological toxicity (2 patients). Celecoxib was stopped
in 2 patients due to renal insufficiency in one case and
hemoptysis (related to lung metastasis) in the other, and
MTX dosage was reduced in 4 patients because of grade
II or III mucositis.

RESULTS
At the end of the observation period, the mean
duration of treatment was 17 +/- 14 weeks with 1 patient
still on treatment. 7 out of 16 patients are alive with a
mean follow-up of 28 +/- 15 weeks. Mean washout period
was 5.6 +/- 7 weeks. The best response observed was one
objective response in a child with Hodgkin disease who
received a modified version of the protocol. Four disease
stabilizations (25%) that lasted 24 weeks or more were
also observed. All these patients received the implemented
version of the regimen. Besides, rapid tumor progression

DISCUSSION

1). Interestingly, 2 out of these 3 patients received the
treatment for almost a year. For one patient the treatment
is still ongoing. The second patient relapsed 2 months
after stopping maintenance suggesting it may have been
stopped to early as previously reported in a patient with
medulloblastoma treated with the COMBAT regimen
(22).

We report here the results of a 4-drug metronomic
regimen in children with relapsing or refractory solid
tumors. Of note, the treatment was also proposed to
children at very high-risk of relapse, so that 3 patients
received this treatment as a maintenance therapy (Table

Treatment tolerance was similar to what has been
reported with previous multi-drug metronomic regimens
in pediatric populations [3, 4, 5, 10]. Mostly grade III/IV
hematological toxicities were observed in 10 patients. It
may be worthwhile to note that ¼ of the patients (those
with prior high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral
hematopoietic stem cells transplantation) accounted for
50% of all the AEs. Six out of 16 patients (37.5%) did
not display any grade III or IV toxicities. Therefore, this
regimen is well tolerated in children and also allows
treatment of previously very heavily treated who may not
have been able to tolerate further MTD chemotherapy.
The initial combination of celecoxib and low dose
MTX led to mucositis in 2 out of the 3 first treated
patients. Although no pharmacokinetics study was
performed to confirm the deleterious interaction between
these two drugs, and despite the fact that cox-2 inhibitors
did not change low-dose MTX pharmacokinetics in adults
[23], it was decided to lower the doses of MTX. After the
decrease in MTX dosage, the tolerance of the regimen was
indeed improved and no further mucositis were observed.
One radiological response was noted after 2 cycles
in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma and 4 disease
stabilizations were observed, according to classic
WHO criteria. Although partial and complete responses
have been reported in children receiving metronomic
chemotherapy [3, 4, 5, 24], this type of therapy may
more likely lead to tumor stabilizations [3, 4, 7, 10, 14].
In this regard it should be noted that the RECIST or
WHO criteria may not be adapted in the evaluation of
anti-angiogenic therapies [25]. Indeed, anti-angiogenic
treatments are mainly considered as cytostatic, and as
such are most likely to inhibit tumor progression rather
than induce tumor regression. When considering the time
to progression (TTP), which defines a clinical benefit
by comparing the TTP while the patient is receiving the
therapy immediately before the treatment of interest versus
the TTP while under the experimental treatment, we found
that the experimental MC regimen was associated with
a longer TTP in 8 patients as compared to the previous
lines of treatment. Such analysis of TTP paves the way for
new clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of noncytotoxic therapies such as metronomic treatments, which
are less likely to produce tumor response assessed with
RECIST.
Besides its potential effect in restraining tumor
progression, MC seems to be able to help controlling
pain in children with cancer. We previously reported fast
improvement in pain control in children under MC [10]
and Kivivuori et al. reported that MC could also help
controlling pain symptoms in children with inoperable
brainstem gliomas [26]. In the present study, we reported
similar findings as 11 children (69%) experienced less
pain, thus leading to a decrease in antalgic treatment,
confirming the potential interest of MC in the palliative
setting as already well established with for instance oral
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

etoposide.
Among the 16 patients who were treated with
this metronomic regimen, 7 had previously received
MC, which mainly consisted in oral etoposide alone or
combined with other metronomic agents. Interestingly,
in these patients, TTP was equal or longer with the new
metronomic protocol when compared to TTP with the
previous metronomic regimen. Furthermore, patients for
whom previous metronomic treatment helped controlling
their disease also seemed to have their disease stabilized
for longer period with the 4-drug regimen tested here,
suggesting that cross resistance between metronomic
regimens may not be systematic, opening the way for
potential treatment with several lines of MC regimens
and also re-challenge with the same treatment as recently
reported by Sterba et al. [22].
Compliance is an important issue when considering
oral treatments; we did not evaluate compliance in this
study. Nevertheless, patients were always present for the
planned dose of vinblastine injections suggesting a good
adherence to treatment, although compliance with daily
oral drugs and weekly injections are different type of
constraints.

CONCLUSION
The 4-drug regimen we report in this study was well
tolerated. Although, efficacy cannot be fully assessed
due to the small number of patients who were treated,
the longer TTP observed when compared to previous
lines of treatment strongly suggests a potential interest in
children with refractory disease. A prospective national
multicentric phase II study with ancillary biologic study is
currently under way (clinicaltrial.gov - NCT01285817) as
a result of this pilot study.
