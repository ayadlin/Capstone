Abstract

Author Manuscript

In theory, pharmacological inhibition of oncogenic signaling is an effective strategy to halt
cellular proliferation, induce apoptosis, and eliminate cancer cells. In practice, drugs (e.g.,
PLX-4032) that inhibit oncogenes like B-RAFV600E provide relatively short-term success in
patients, due to a combination of incomplete cellular responses and the development of resistance.
To define the relationship between PLX-4032 induced responses and resistance, we interrogated
the contributions of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in determining the fate of B-RAFV600E
inhibited melanoma cells. While PLX-4032 eliminated B-RAFV600E signaling leading to marked
cell cycle arrest, only a fraction of cells eventually underwent apoptosis. These data proposed two
hypotheses regarding B-RAFV600E inhibition: (1) only a few cells generate a pro-apoptotic signal,
or (2) all the cells generate a pro-apoptotic signal but the majority silences this pathway to ensure
survival. Indeed, the latter hypothesis is supported by our observations as the addition of
ABT-737, an inhibitor to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, revealed massive apoptosis following

PLX-4032 exposure. B-RAFV600E inhibition alone sensitized cells to the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis characterized by the rapid accumulation of BIM on the outer mitochondrial
membrane, which could be functionally revealed by ABT-737 to promote apoptosis and loss of
clonogenic survival. Furthermore, PLX-4032 resistant cells demonstrated collateral resistance to
conventional chemotherapy; yet could be re-sensitized to PLX-4032 by BCL-2 family inhibition
in vivo and conventional chemotherapies in vitro. Our data suggest that inhibiting anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 proteins will enhance primary responses to PLX-4032, along with reducing the
development of resistance to both targeted and conventional therapies.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

In numerous tumor types, such as malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, and
adenocarcinoma of the lung, oncogenic signaling is required to maintain high levels of
cellular proliferation and evade cell death (1, 2). A classic example of a cancer-associated
oncogene is the mutated form of B-RAF, where a substitution of valine to glutamate at
amino acid residue 600 (B-RAFV600E) renders the kinase hyperactive leading to constitutive
MAPK signaling, unregulated cell cycle, and coordinated silencing of the cell death
machinery (2–5). In the recent years, small molecules (e.g., PLX-4032) have been developed
and approved for the treatment of B-RAFV600E positive cancers, and while oncogenic
signaling is effectively blocked in these tumors, the death of tumor cells does not reflect
similar rates of success (6–8). Moreover, B-RAFV600E positive patients are exposed to high
concentrations of PLX-4032 for several weeks, leading to the rapid development of
PLX-4032 resistant tumors and the subsequent requirement for alternative chemotherapeutic
strategies (9, 10).

It is hypothesized that targeted (e.g., PLX-4032) and conventional (e.g., dacarbazine)
chemotherapeutic strategies eliminate tumor cells by inducing a form of cell death called
apoptosis, which is governed by the BCL-2 family of proteins and mitochondria (11).
Apoptosis proceeds when the BCL-2 family compromises the outer mitochondrial
membrane (OMM) allowing for pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., cytochrome c) within
mitochondria to gain access to the cytoplasm, which leads to caspase activation and the
apoptotic phenotype (12). The BCL-2 family is composed of two types of proteins: antiapoptotic and pro-apoptotic (13). Anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1)
preserve survival by binding and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic proteins. The pro-apoptotic
members are divided into ‘effectors’ and the ‘BH3-only proteins’. The effector proteins
BAK and BAX homo-oligomerize into proteolipid pores at mitochondria to release
cytochrome c; however, this requires an activation step mediated by the ‘direct activator’
BH3-only proteins (14–16). BID and BIM are the major direct activators, and function via
their BH3 domains to induce BAK/BAX activation and apoptosis. In most cases, the other
BH3-only proteins (e.g., BAD & PUMA; referred to as ‘sensitizer/de-repressor’ BH3-only
proteins) only bind to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and establish the apoptotic threshold by

promoting BID and/or BIM activities (17). Dynamic interactions between the pro- and antiapoptotic proteins govern cellular fate: agents that promote BID/BIM activity enhance
apoptosis, while mechanisms that block BID/BIM activity lead to cellular survival and
chemotherapeutic resistance (11).
The clinical relevance of the BCL-2 family is highlighted by the development of small
molecule BH3 mimetics (e.g., ABT-199, ABT-263, ABT-737) that have entered multiple
clinical trials (18–21). These mimetics function by lowering the cellular threshold for
apoptosis, presumably by decreasing the availability of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
members which promotes pro-apoptotic protein function at the OMM. At present, there is
minimal information on the application of these small molecules in melanoma treatment
(19).

In the current study, we were interested in defining the mechanistic intersections between
PLX-4032 induced cell death signaling and resistance, and interrogated the contributions of
the BCL-2 proteins in determining the fate of B-RAFV600E inhibited cells. We utilized
melanoma as a model system to explore the biology of B-RAFV600E, as this is the common
oncogene associated with the majority of malignant melanoma cases (4, 5). Furthermore, BRAFV600E positive melanoma patient responses to PLX-4032 have been encouraging, but
require additional insights to improve primary treatment efficacy and reduce the likelihood
of chemoresistance (6, 22, 23).

Our experiments began by validating that the B-RAFV600E cellular model systems
responded to PLX-4032 by decreasing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p44/42). To address
this, A375 (B-RAFV600E human malignant melanoma) and MeWo (B-RAFWT human
malignant melanoma) were treated with PLX-4032 for 0 – 24 hours, and total cell lysates
were analyzed by western blot. Indeed, PLX-4032 decreased the majority of phosphorylated
ERK in the A375 cells, but MeWo remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). The cellular response to
the decrease in ERK signaling reflected a marked inhibition of cellular proliferation as
approximately 96% of A375 cells treated with PLX-4032 arrested in the G1 phase of cell
cycle after 48 hours (Fig. 1B); while MeWo demonstrated no change in proliferation
comparing DMSO (24.3% in S phase) to PLX-4032 (25.4% in S phase) treatments (Fig.
1C). Interestingly, when PLX-4032 exposure was extended to 72 hours, the treatment
promoted a small percentage of cells to undergo cell death, as measured by Annexin V
staining (Fig. 1D). The cell death phenotype was prevented by pre-treatment with zVADfmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, which suggested the mechanism of cell death was apoptosis
(Fig. 1E). Importantly, MeWo demonstrated no apoptotic response to PLX-4032 treatment
(Fig. 1F). To ensure the effects of PLX-4032 were not specific to the A375 cell line, we also
evaluated SK-MEL-28, another B-RAFV600E human malignant melanoma line, and while
ERK phosphorylation and cell cycle were markedly inhibited, the cell death responses to
PLX-4032 were minimal (Figs. S1A–C).
The results in figure 1D proposed two hypotheses regarding B-RAFV600E inhibition and cell
death signaling: (1) only a few cells generate a pro-apoptotic signal and die following
PLX-4032 treatment, or (2) all the cells generate a pro-apoptotic signal but the majority fail
to respond ensuring survival. Pro-apoptotic signaling biochemically arises as the increased
expression and/or activation of specific BH3-only proteins, and the major cellular
mechanism to inhibit the BH3-only signal is by direct sequestration on the anti-apoptotic

BCL-2 repertoire (e.g., BID directly inhibited by BCL-2) (13). To determine the
contribution of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire in the regulation of PLX-4032 induced
pro-apoptotic signaling, we examined the effect of ABT-737, a small molecule inhibitor to
several anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins (i.e., BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w; but not MCL-1)
(21). ABT-737 is suggested to lower the threshold leading to apoptosis by preventing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins from binding BH3-only proteins and/or by releasing BH3-only
proteins from anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members to enhance BAK/BAX activation (21).
Returning to our hypotheses, we next determined if ABT-737 pre-treatment revealed a proapoptotic signal in the majority of B-RAFV600E inhibited cells.

Author Manuscript

In mouse models and the clinic, ABT-737 as a single therapy is well tolerated and does not
cause any marked apoptosis phenotype (21, 26). Indeed, the same is the case in A375 and
SK-MEL-28 as ABT-737 treatment for up to 48 hours resulted in no apoptosis, which is
likely explained by MCL-1 expression (Figs. 2A, 2B, S1C; n.b., ABT-737 does not inhibit
MCL-1) (11). To directly examine our proposed above hypotheses, we co-treated cells with
PLX-4032 and ABT-737 and measured apoptosis after 48 hours. Pretreatment with
ABT-737 revealed dose-dependent apoptosis that was both rapid and robust (Figs. 2C, S1C),
in several experiments nearly 100% of the population responded by inducing apoptosis.
Similar to PLX-4032 alone (Fig. 1E), the marked cell death revealed by ABT-737 was
prevented by zVAD-fmk pretreatment (Fig. 2D); and characterized by nuclear
fragmentation, a hallmark feature of apoptosis (Figs. 2E–F).

In order to better understand the relationship between cellular responses to B-RAFV600E
inhibition and the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, we next implicated the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis as a target downstream of PLX-4032 treatment. Firstly, the proapoptotic protein BAX is often engaged following cellular stress leading to apoptosis,
therefore we examined if BAX became activated by the use of an active conformation
specific antibody (clone 6A7) following PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment (27). A375
cells were treated with PLX-4032 and ABT-737 for 24 hours, and whole cell lysates were
subjected to 6A7 immunoprecipitation and western blot. Indeed, the combination led to a
marked increase in 6A7-recognized BAX, whereas neither treatment alone resulted in
significant recognition (Fig 2G). Secondly, as PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment results
in BAX activation, we examined if the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL could block the death
response. Indeed, transient transfection of wild type BCL-xL, but not a BAX-binding mutant
(i.e., BCL-xL G138A), prevented the majority of cell death induced by PLX-4032 and
ABT-737 co-treatment (Fig. 2I). Thirdly, BCL-xL inhibited BAX activation suggesting that
our co-treatment results in cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol to initiate
apoptosis. To directly examine this, we treated cells with PLX-4032 ± ABT-737 for 24
hours, fractionated the cells into pellet (“p”, contains mitochondria) and supernatant (“s”,
cytosolic proteins), and subjected these fractions to western blot analysis for cytochrome c
(Fig. 2H). As shown in figure 2H, the combination of PLX-4032 and ABT-737 resulted in
marked cytochrome c redistribution from the pellet to the supernatant, whereas neither drug
alone influenced cytochrome c localization. Finally, the combination of drugs led to a
marked decrease in clonogenic survival in A375 and SK-MEL-28 (Figs. 2J, S1D). To
broaden the relevance of these studies, we tested additional melanoma models: MALME-3E,

MDA-MB-435, and WM266-4; and ABT-737 revealed dose-dependent apoptosis in all BRAFV600E positive lines (Figs. S1E–G).

The above data suggest that the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members are responsible for
silencing the pro-apoptotic signal induced by the inhibition of oncogenic B-RAFV600E. We
hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic proteins were directly inhibiting a PLX-4032 induced
pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, and therefore screened through all the pro-apoptotic
BCL-2 proteins by preparing whole cell lysates and western blot studies. The majority of
BCL-2 family proteins remained unchanged, except for BIM, which demonstrated a marked
dose-dependent accumulation of two isoforms, BIM-EL and BIM-L following PLX-4032
treatment (Fig. 3A). BH3-only proteins bind with high affinity to anti-apoptotic BCL-2
proteins localized to the OMM, so we prepared heavy membrane fractions (i.e., commonly
referred to as mitochondria) from PLX-4032 treated cells, and were able to observe marked
PLX-4032 dependent accumulation of all three BIM isoforms, including the potent proapoptotic form, BIM-S (Figs. 3B, S1H). No other mitochondrial-associated BCL-2 family
members demonstrated altered expression. We noted that the level of each BIM isoform was
relatively modest in relationship to the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, and all BIM isoforms
were exclusively localized to the heavy membrane fractions (i.e., no unbound cytosolic BIM
protein was detected), suggesting that the availability of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins
superseded the levels of expressed BIM (Fig. 3C, S1H), and this may be the mechanism
explaining minimal pro-apoptotic responses following PLX-4032 treatment (Figs 1D, 2C,
S1C). As control, ABT-737 did not regulate the expression of BIM in any cell line (Figs.
3B, S1H), and MeWo did not demonstrate PLX-4032 regulated BIM expression (Fig. 3D).
To ensure BIM was critical to PLX-4032 induced apoptosis, we stably silenced bim
expression in A375 and SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 3E), and examined cell death following
PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment (Fig. 3F). Indeed, silencing bim eliminated the
majority of cell death induced by the PLX-4032 and ABT-737 combination treatment.

Author Manuscript

We next hypothesized that ABT-737 could de-repress BIM from the inhibitory interaction
with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins at the OMM to promote cytochrome c release (Fig. 2H)
and apoptosis (Figs. 2C, S1C). To biochemically examine this hypothesis, we prepared
heavy membrane fractions from PLX-4032 treated cells and tested for ABT-737 induced
cytochrome c release in vitro. As shown in figure 4A, heavy membranes from PLX-4032
treated A375 cells demonstrated dose-dependent cytochrome c release in response to
ABT-737 addition; in contrast, mitochondria from A375 cells treated with DMSO elicited
no response to ABT-737 (Fig. 4A). C8-BID treatment is a positive control for BH3-only
protein induced cytochrome c release to ensure all mitochondrial isolations respond in vitro
(Fig. 4A); and mitochondria isolated from PLX-4032 treated MeWo are a negative control
and demonstrated no response to ABT-737 (Fig. 4B). The above observations demonstrate
that: (1) the PLX-4032 mediated inhibition of oncogenic B-RAFV600E induces a proapoptotic signal that accumulates on mitochondria; (2) the pro-apoptotic signal remains
silenced within B-RAFV600E cells via an interaction with anti-apoptotic proteins on the
OMM; and (3) ABT-737 can reveal the PLX-4032 induced pro-apoptotic signal to engage
cytochrome c release and cell death.

The data in figures 3 and 4A suggest that BIM is involved in PLX-4032/ABT-737 induced
cytochrome c release; therefore, we directly tested this hypothesis by examining the
cytochrome c releasing activity of BIM on purified mitochondria from A375 and MeWo.
Mitochondria were isolated, treated with BIM, fractionated into pellet and supernatant, and
the fractions were analyzed by western blot for cytochrome c. Indeed, treatment with the
direct activator BIM was sufficient to promote rapid and complete cytochrome c release,
while treatment with a sensitizer/de-repressor BH3-only protein (e.g., PUMA) or ABT-737
resulted in no cytochrome c release (Fig. 4C). We interpret these results to suggest that
independent of B-RAF status, our model systems sustain the ability to induce cytochrome c
release and apoptosis, and that pro-apoptotic signaling upstream of BIM and mitochondria
dictates cellular fate.

Author Manuscript

Our previous results suggested that BCL-xL could block PLX-4032 induced pro-apoptotic
signaling (Fig. 2I), therefore we examined if BIM-mediated cytochrome c release in vitro
was also blocked by BCL-xL. The addition of BCL-xL completely inhibited BIM-induced
cytochrome c release from both A375 and MeWo mitochondria; and furthermore, this
inhibition was reversed by the addition of ABT-737 (Fig. 4D), which parallels our cellular
results (Figs. 2C, S1C). As control for our protein and mitochondrial purifications, we also
provide evidence that MCL-1 mediated inhibition of BIM-induced cytochrome c release is
only reversed by the addition of PUMA (n.b., ABT-737 does not bind MCL-1), whereas
PUMA or ABT-737 could de-repress the inhibitory activity of BCL-xL, (i.e., PUMA and
ABT-737 bind BCL-xL) (Fig. 4D) (11, 13, 17, 21).

In our experiments, we show that ABT-737 can promote PLX-4032 mediated apoptosis,
presumably by releasing pro-apoptotic BIM from anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins localized to
the OMM. We formally examined this hypothesis by determining if BIM could be displaced
from the OMM by the addition of ABT-737 in vitro. Mitochondria from PLX-4032 treated
A375 cells were isolated, incubated with ABT-737 for 1 hour prior to centrifugation, and
subjected to western blot for BIM. PLX-4032 treatment promoted the accumulation of
multiple BIM isoforms on the OMM (Fig. 4E, left panel); and the addition of ABT-737 to
these mitochondria resulted in a decreased presence of BIM isoforms (Fig. 4E, right panel).
For control, we also examined the effect of PUMA on the binding of BIM to these
mitochondria. PUMA binds with high affinity to all anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, and this
should eliminate the majority of BIM associated with the OMM. Indeed, PUMA addition
reduced BIM levels to mitochondria isolated from untreated A375 cells (Fig. 4E). To ensure
the release of BIM from the OMM was mediated by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, we
immunoprecipitated BCL-xL from PLX-4032 treated mitochondria ± ABT-737. As shown
in figure 4F, BCL-xL·BIM complexes were observed in PLX-4032 treated cells, but the
addition of ABT-737 markedly reduced the level of BIM associated with BCL-xL. All
together, these data suggest that ABT-737 can efficiently displace BIM from anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 proteins on the OMM to promote apoptosis (Figs. 4E–F).
Figures 3A and 3B show that multiple anti-apoptotic (i.e., BCL-2/BCL-xL and MCL-1) and
pro-apoptotic (i.e., BAK/BAX, BIM, and PUMA) BCL-2 family members likely regulate
cellular sensitivity to cytochrome c release following PLX-4032 treatment. Furthermore, the
requirement for ABT-737 within this complex BCL-2 family network reveals a unique

dependence on BCL-2/BCL-xL to maintain survival following the inhibition of BRAFV600E. To examine the exquisite dependency on ABT-737 to promote cytochrome c
release, we modeled the BCL-2 family network observed in A375 cells using biochemically
defined large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and recombinant BCL-2 family members (14,
28). The LUVs are composed of the major lipid species that comprise mitochondrial
membranes, and treatment of mitochondrial LUVs with BAX or BIM alone did not cause
LUV permeabilization; but when combined, resulted in BIM mediated dose-dependent BAX
activation and LUV permeabilization (Fig. 4G). As suggested in figures 3A–D and 4E–F,
BIM is the pro-apoptotic protein directly responsible for cytochrome c release, and similar
results were obtained using the LUV system, as PUMA did not cause permeabilization alone
or in the presence of BAX (Figure 4H). Finally, we examined the integration of BAX, BCLxL, BIM, MCL-1, and PUMA in the LUV system, which revealed that this unique
combination of BCL-2 family proteins did not promote LUV permeabilization unless
ABT-737 was added, suggesting that ABT-737 could specifically trigger BIM-mediated
BAX activation in this setting (Fig. 4I).
From these data, we propose: (1) the pro-apoptotic signal mediated by the inhibition of
oncogenic B-RAFV600E is the mitochondrial accumulation of multiple BIM isoforms; (2) the
majority of pro-apoptotic BIM is silenced by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family leading to
sustained survival; (3) ABT-737 reveals the pro-apoptotic activity of BIM to induce
cytochrome c release and marked apoptosis; and (4) orally available derivates of ABT-737
(i.e., ABT-263) may be a useful combination strategy with PLX-4032 to boost cell death
responses early in chemotherapeutic regimens (20).

Patients treated with targeted therapies like PLX-4032 often experience prolonged survival,
yet succumb to the rapid development of drug-resistant populations leading to few clinical
options (10). To evaluate the utility of ABT-737 in treating PLX-4032 resistant populations,
we created several PLX-4032 resistant B-RAFV600E cell models using parental A375 and
SK-MEL-28 cells, and refer to these lines as ‘A375R’ and ‘SK-MEL-28R’, respectively. To
characterize the lines, we removed PLX-4032 for 24 hours prior to re-treating and
subsequent analyses. A375R and SK-MEL-28R cells were treated with PLX-4032 for 24
hours and we analyzed responses to ERK phosphorylation status and cell cycle distribution.
PLX-4032 treatment did not markedly change ERK signaling in A375R (Fig. 5A) or SKMEL-28R (Fig. S3A), and there were minimal changes to cell cycle distribution compared to
the parental lines (Figs. 5B, S3B), both of which suggest bone fide PLX-4032 resistance. We
next compared the apoptotic responses in the parental and resistant lines following
PLX-4032 exposure. As shown in figures 5C and S3C, A375R and SK-MEL-28R
demonstrated markedly less cell death compared to the parental lines. Furthermore, A375R
also displayed parallel resistance to common inducers of apoptosis, e.g., staurosporine and
cycloheximide, but not VP16. This suggested to us that the resistant lines selectively
silenced pro-apoptotic signaling following certain stresses, but did not have a mutation in
the core apoptotic signaling cascade (e.g., APAF-1 or caspases-9/-3) or marked changes
within the BCL-2 family (Figs. 5D, S2A–B).
To investigate a mechanism of selective apoptosis-insensitivity in A375R and SK-MEL-28R,
we next compared BIM expression and accumulation on mitochondria in the parental and

PLX-4032 resistant lines following PLX-4032 exposure. PLX-4032 treatment induced
marked BIM expression (Fig. 5E) and mitochondrial accumulation (Fig. 5F) in the parental
A375 line, but these responses were severely blunted in A375R, which also paralleled the
lack of apoptosis (Figs. 5C). Likewise, A375R failed to induce bim mRNA compared to the
parental A375 line after PLX-4032 treatment (Fig. 5G). Despite not being able to detect
significant BIM mRNA or protein accumulation in A375R, ABT-737 pre-treatment was able
to reveal a pro-apoptotic signal following PLX-4032 treatment, suggesting that either
minimal BIM induction or an unimplicated BH3-only protein was functional to promote
apoptosis (Figs 5H). Importantly, the above observations were reproducible in SK-MEL-28R
(Fig S3D–E).

In addition to B-RAFV600E specific therapies, drugs inhibiting other components of the
MAPK signaling pathway (i.e., MEK) and conventional chemotherapeutic agents are often
used to treat metastatic melanoma (19, 29). For this reason, and the observed apoptotic
resistance presented in figures 5C–G and S3C–E, we were interested in investigating if the
A375R and SK-MEL-29R lines maintained sensitivity to another targeted therapy (i.e.,
GSK-110212, a MEK inhibitor) and/or conventional chemotherapeutic agents used to treat
metastatic disease (e.g., cisplatin, dacarbazine, and vinblastine). A375R and SK-MEL-28R
lines displayed marked resistance to GSK-110212 induced apoptosis, compared to the
parental lines (Figs. S4A–C). Furthermore, A375R were also resistant to the cisplatin,
dacarbazine, and vinblastine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5I); but this phenotype did not extend
to the SK-MEL-28R line (Figs. S3F–G). To determine the role of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2
repertoire in mediating the marked resistance in A375R, we pre-treated the resistant line with
ABT-737, and then exposed the cells to GSK-1101212, cisplatin, dacarbazine, or
vinblastine. Interestingly, re-sensitization of A375R to cell death induced by all of these
drugs was achieved with ABT-737 in a manner similar to parental A375 (Figs. 5J, S4A–B,
S4D), indicating that the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire may be of significant clinical
utility following acquired drug resistance.

To extend our findings that anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family inhibition may enhance treatment
success when cancer cells display resistant to PLX-4032, as suggested by in vitro
experiments using A375R and SK-MEL-29R (Figs. 5H and S3E), we next examined SKMEL-28R melanoma xenografts. Instead of using ABT-737 for these experiments, we
switched to ABT-263, a small molecule inhibitor that displays nearly identical binding
properties to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins compared to ABT-737, but ABT-263 is orally
bioavailable and administered to patients (20). First, we compared ABT-263 and ABT-737
for the ability to enhance PLX-4032 induced apoptosis in SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-28R.
As shown in figures 6A–B, ABT-263 and ABT-737 functioned equivalently to sensitize
both cell lines to PLX-4032 induced apoptosis. Next, we generated SK-MEL-28R xenografts
(Fig. 6C), and then treated these tumor-bearing mice with a daily oral gavage of PLX-4032
(100 mg/kg) ± ABT-263 (10 mg/kg) for one week, which is half the dose and average
treatment duration for PLX-4032 regimens in melanoma patients. Control (vehicle injected)
or ABT-263 treatment alone resulted in minimal changes in tumor growth; however, we
noted PLX-4032 treatment resulted in larger tumors compared to control (Fig. 6D). Despite
the increase in tumor volume induced by PLX-4032 treatment, the combination of

PLX-4032 and ABT-263 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor growth and subsequent
increases in TUNEL positivity, a marker of apoptosis (Figs. 6D–F). Importantly, there were
no marked changes to tumor cell proliferation (Figs. 6G–H, S5A) or tumor vascularization
(Fig. S5B) amongst treatment groups. It should be noted that we observed the SK-MEL-28R
tumors grew with greater size heterogeneity compared to the parental SK-MEL-28 line
(Figs. 6C and S6A). SKMEL-28R average tumor volumes before and after treatment, along
with the range in tumor sizes, are provided (Fig. S6B). Finally, we ensured that the
PLX-4032 in the in vivo treatments was effective against parental SK-MEL-28 tumors, so
we evaluated SK-MEL-28 xenografts for PLX-4032 responses. Indeed, PLX-4032 treated
SK-MEL-28 tumors responded as there was an observable decrease in tumor volume (Fig.
S6C).

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The conclusions from our work reveal the mechanism of action for synergy between the
parallel inhibition of B-RAFV600E signaling and the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family repertoire
(Figs. 2 – 6). Furthermore, our data suggest that collateral inhibition of the anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 repertoire with ABT-737 (or the orally available form, ABT-263) may provide a
much-needed clinical opportunity to increase primary response rates to targeted therapies
like PLX-4032 and GSK-110212. This combination may decrease the chances of
chemoresistance as the concentrations of drugs required to achieve a durable response will
likely be lower (Fig. 6D), and many more tumor cells will be eliminated (Figs. 2C, 5H, 6A–
B, S1C, S1E, S3E, S4A–B, S4D, S6C). In addition, if PLX-4032 resistance is unavoidable,
ABT-737/263 may assist in re-sensitizing patients to additional targeted therapies as
suggested by our data and other publications (Figs. S4A–B) (30), and may increase the
response rates to conventional chemotherapeutic strategies (Figs. 5J, S3F–G, S4D). While
our data have been generated in several commonly used laboratory models of B-RAFV600E
and melanoma biology, the utility of our biochemical and promising cellular results must be
explored using in vivo genetic model systems to fully appreciate their likelihood of
benefiting patients.

comparison. The parental line was treated with only the lower dose of PLX-4032 to avoid
apoptosis. (C) A375 and A375R were treated with PLX-4032 (0.1, 0.25, 1, 5, 10 µM) for 72
hours before AnnexinV staining and flow cytometry. Staurosporine (50 nM, STS) is shown
as a positive control. *p value = < 0.05. (D) A375 and A375R were treated with
cycloheximide (CHX; 10, 25, 100 µg/ml), STS (1, 10, 50 nM), or VP16 (5, 10, 50 µM) for
48 hours, and analyzed by AnnexinV and flow cytometry. (E) A375 and A375R were
treated with 10 µM PLX-4032 for indicated times before western blot for BIM. GAPDH is
shown as a loading control. (F) A375 and A375R were treated with PLX-4032 (1, 10 µM)
for 24 hours, the HM fractions were isolated and subjected to western blot analysis for BIM.
SMAC is shown as a mitochondrial loading control. (G) A375 and A375R were treated with
PLX-4032 (10 µM) for indicated times, and bim mRNA was measured by qPCR. Data are
normalized to gapdh and 18S. *p value = < 0.005. (H) A375R was pre-treated with
ABT-737 (1.0 µM) for 1 hour before treatment with PLX-4032 (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 µM)
for 48 hours, and analyzed by AnnexinV and flow cytometry. (I) A375 and A375R were
treated with cisplatin (CIS; 10, 50, 100 µM), dacarbazine (DAC; 100, 500, 1000 µM), or
vinblastine (VIN; 1, 10, 50 nM) for 48 hours, and analyzed by AnnexinV and flow
cytometry. (J) A375R was pre-treated with ABT-737 (1.0 µM) for 1 hour before treatment
with cisplatin (CIS; 10, 50, 100 µM), dacarbazine (DAC; 100, 500, 1000 µM), or vinblastine
(VIN; 1, 10, 50 nM) for 48 hours, and analyzed by AnnexinV and flow cytometry. All data
are representative of at least triplicate experiments, and reported as ± S.D., as required.

Inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members with ABT-263 sensitizes SK-MEL-28R
to undergo apoptosis following PLX-4032 treatment. (A–B) SK-MEL-28 and SM-MEL-28R
were pre-treated with ABT-737 or ABT-263 (0.5 µM) for 1 hour before treatment with
PLX-4032 (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 µM) for 48 hours, and analyzed by AnnexinV and flow
cytometry. *p value = < 0.005. (C) SK-MEL-28R tumors were monitored for tumor growth
for up to 5 weeks prior to treatment. (D) Tumor-bearing mice in C were treated as indicated
(10 mg/kg ABT-263 ± 100 mg/kg PLX-4032, or control) for one week, and final tumor

volumes were recorded. (E) Tumor sections were stained with TUNEL and propidium
iodide for apoptosis and total cell number, respectively. Bars indicate 100 µM. (F)
Representative tissue sections from each treatment were quantified to determine the total
number of TUNEL positive cells. Approximately 5000 cells per treatment were evaluated;
and the percentages of TUNEL (+) cells per treatment are indicated. (G) Tumor sections
were stained for EdU and DAPI to determine the number of proliferating cells (EdU) per
unit (DAPI) area. Individual colors are shown in figure S5A. (H) Quantification of EdU
positive cells is shown; values are adjusted using ~ 1 × 106 µm2 DAPI positive regions for
normalization. Two tumors per treatment group were analyzed in three regions. All figures
are representative of at least triplicate data points, and reported as ± S.D. Xenograft data
represent at least 8 tumors for each treatment group.
