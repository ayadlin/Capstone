ABSTRACT
A wide range of human malignancies displays aberrant activation of Hedgehog
(HH)/GLI signaling, including cancers of the skin, brain, gastrointestinal tract and
hematopoietic system. Targeting oncogenic HH/GLI signaling with small molecule
inhibitors of the essential pathway effector Smoothened (SMO) has shown remarkable
therapeutic effects in patients with advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma.
However, acquired and de novo resistance to SMO inhibitors poses severe limitations
to the use of SMO antagonists and urgently calls for the identification of novel targets
and compounds.
Here we report on the identification of the Dual-Specificity-TyrosinePhosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1B (DYRK1B) as critical positive regulator of
HH/GLI signaling downstream of SMO. Genetic and chemical inhibition of DYRK1B
in human and mouse cancer cells resulted in marked repression of HH signaling
and GLI1 expression, respectively. Importantly, DYRK1B inhibition profoundly
impaired GLI1 expression in both SMO-inhibitor sensitive and resistant settings.
We further introduce a novel small molecule DYRK1B inhibitor, DYRKi, with suitable
pharmacologic properties to impair SMO-dependent and SMO-independent oncogenic
GLI activity. The results support the use of DYRK1B antagonists for the treatment
of HH/GLI-associated cancers where SMO inhibitors fail to demonstrate therapeutic
efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

intricate process involving numerous regulatory processes.
Briefly, in the absence of HH ligand, the twelvetransmembrane protein Patched (PTCH) represses HH
signaling by preventing the G-protein coupled receptorlike protein Smoothened (SMO) to translocate to the
primary cilium, an antenna-like compartment central to
the activation of canonical HH/GLI signaling. Binding of
HH to its receptor PTCH revokes the repressive effect of
PTCH thereby allowing SMO to enter the primary cilium
and initiate signaling. In the cilium, SMO activates the
GLI zinc finger transcription factors GLI2/3 by preventing
the formation of GLI repressor forms and by releasing
GLIs from their negative regulator Suppressor of Fused
(SUFU). Translocation of GLI2/3 activator forms to the

The Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway plays a central
role in the control of vertebrate development and tissue
homeostasis of adult mammalian organisms, while its
uncontrolled activation or inefficient termination has been
implicated in a number of human malignancies including
cancers of the skin, brain, hematopoietic system, lung,
ovary and of the gastrointestinal tract [1]. Targeting
oncogenic HH/GLI signaling in cancer and cancer stem
cells has therefore emerged as promising therapeutic
strategy for many malignant diseases with high medical
need [2, 3].

the potent transcriptional activator and oncogene GLI1
(for detailed reviews see [4-7]).
The etiologic role of HH signaling in cancer has
triggered numerous efforts to develop HH pathway
antagonists targeting the essential HH effector SMO
[8]. In 2012, the FDA approved vismodegib, a small
molecule inhibitor of SMO, for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Vismodegib provides a remarkable
therapeutic benefit to patients with advanced or metastatic
basal cell carcinoma (BCC) [3], a malignancy caused
by loss of PTCH or mutational activation of SMO [9].
Despite several successful trials with BCC patients and
case studies with medulloblastoma (MB) patients, the
therapeutic efficacy of SMO targeting is challenged
by acquired and de novo drug resistance [10-12].
Furthermore, clinical trials with SMO inhibitors so far
have failed to prove a clear therapeutic benefit for patients
with non-BCC malignancies including colorectal, ovarian
and pancreatic cancer [13, 14].
De novo resistance to SMO targeting can – at least
in part – be explained by the uncoupling of GLI activation
from canonical SMO-dependent HH signaling. Various
molecular cues and genetic alterations responsible for
SMO-independent GLI activation in cancer cells have
been identified. Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases,
RAS/MAP kinase, PI3K/AKT/S6K, DYRK1A, PKC
and histone deacetylases can enhance the transcriptional
activity of GLI in human cancer cells [15-21]. Likewise,
genetic loss of SUFU results in constitutive GLI activation
independent of SMO signaling [22]. In pancreatic cancer,
TGFβ/SMAD signaling is able to induce expression of
GLI activator forms [23] and in Ewing Sarcoma the EWSFLI1 oncogene directly stimulates GLI1 expression [24].
GLI proteins, particularly GLI1, act as potent
oncogenic drivers by promoting a variety of malignant
traits including proliferation, survival, invasion and
metastasis (reviewed in [7]). GLI1 also represents a
critical determinant of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells in
several entities such as glioblastoma, colorectal cancer and
pancreatic cancer [16, 25-27]. These oncogenic properties
together with the capacity of GLI1 to integrate and relay
common SMO-independent cancer-promoting cues such as
receptor-tyrosine kinase pathways, PI3K and MAP kinase
signaling render GLI1 an attractive molecular target for
cancer therapy. However, unlike kinase inhibition, direct
targeting of transcription factors is generally considered
challenging. Some recent studies demonstrated successful
inhibition, though with yet unclear clinical relevance and
specificity [28-32].
We therefore turned our focus to kinases as well
established therapeutic targets to identify druggable
effectors involved in promoting both canonical and SMOindependent GLI activation in cancer. Candidate kinases
include members of the Dual-Specificity TyrosinePhosphorylation-Regulated Kinase (DYRK) family, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have been shown to positively and negatively modify HH
signaling and to have oncogenic functions in solid cancers
known to be associated with HH/GLI signaling including
pancreatic cancer [33]. The DYRK family comprises two
subfamilies with a total of five members [34]. Of note, the
class I DYRK family member DYRK1A is able to enhance
GLI1 activity, while the closely related yet functionally
distinct class I member DYRK1B has been shown to
increase HH ligand expression and prevent autocrine
HH pathway activation [15, 35]. By contrast, the class
II family member DYRK2 negatively affects HH/GLI
signaling by triggering the destabilization and degradation
of GLI2/3 transcription factors (Figure 1A) [36]. Whether
DYRK family members can serve as therapeutic targets
in HH/GLI-associated cancer entities has not yet been
addressed.
In this study we analyzed the role of class I DYRK
members and identified DYRK1B as critical player in
both SMO-inhibitor sensitive and resistant settings.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel small molecule
DYRK1B inhibitor with potent in vitro and in vivo activity
targeting GLI dependent cancer cells. We propose that
small molecule inhibition of DYRK1B represents a novel
and promising approach to target HH/GLI-associated
cancers including malignancies with acquired or de novo
resistance to SMO inhibitors.

RESULTS
Chemical inhibition of class I DYRK members
impairs HH/GLI pathway activation
Members of the DYRK family can modulate GLI
activity in opposite directions. While DYRK2 promotes
GLI degradation [36], overexpression of the class I family
member DYRK1A is able to promote the transcriptional
activity of GLI1 (Figure 1A) [15]. Whether smallmolecule modulation of DYRK is able to inhibit HH/GLI
signaling in cancer cells has not yet been addressed.
To study whether inhibition of DYRK1 kinases
affects oncogenic HH/GLI signaling, we first measured
the effect of the known class I DYRK inhibitor harmine
[37] on HH/GLI pathway activity. As assay system we
employed HH-responsive, SMO-inhibitor sensitive
human medulloblastoma cells (DAOY) (Figure 1B) [38]
and measured changes in the expression of the known HH
target genes GLI1 and PTCH as quantitative read-out for
pathway activity.
Smoothened Agonist (SAG) treatment of DAOY
cells induced mRNA expression of the HH targets GLI1
and PTCH, which was effectively repressed by the
SMO inhibitor vismodegib (vismo) and notably, also
by the DYRK1 inhibitor harmine in a concentration
dependent manner with an IC50(harmine) of 10.9 µM (Figure
7135

Oncotarget

1C, 1D). Similar to vismodegib, harmine prevented
the accumulation of GLI1 protein in response to SAG
treatment (Figure 1E), together suggesting that class I
DYRK family members may serve as targets for HH/GLI
signal inhibition by non-SMO antagonists.

validate the involvement of DYRK1 kinases in HH
pathway regulation and to address whether DYRK1A,
DYRK1B or both kinases account for the repressive effect
of harmine on HH/GLI pathway activity, we performed
genetic RNA-interference mediated perturbation
experiments in cells with activated canonical HH/GLI
signaling. In SAG-stimulated human medulloblastoma
cells, stable, lentiviral shRNA inhibition of DYRK1A
moderately reduced GLI1 and PTCH mRNA expression
by 55 and 40 percent, respectively (Figure 2A, 2B). By
contrast, knockdown of DYRK1B efficiently abolished
HH target gene expression below levels of unstimulated
cells. We confirmed the contribution of DYRK1B to

HH target gene activation with a second, less functional
shRNA against DYRK1B (shD1B#2) resulting in
reduction of GLI1 and PTCH mRNA expression by more
than 50 and 60 percent, respectively, compared to SAGstimulated cells transduced with scrambled control shRNA
(Figure 2A, 2B). Analysis of GLI1 protein expression
confirmed mRNA expression data. Inhibition of DYRK1A
moderately reduced GLI1 protein levels in SAG-treated
DAOY cells, while depletion of DYRK1B efficiently
eliminated GLI1 protein expression (Figure 2C).
Reduction of DYRK1B expression using shD1B#2 with
moderate or shD1B#3 with little functionality repressed
GLI1 protein expression proportional to the shRNA
functionality (Figure 2C). RNAi-mediated inhibition of
DYRK1B did not impair the formation of the primary
cilium, an antenna-like compartment essential for HH/GLI
signal transduction [4], suggesting that HH/GLI inhibition
by DYRK1B targeting is not due to impaired ciliogenesis

(Figure S1). The requirement of Dyrk1b for Hh/Gli
signaling was also obvious in murine Ptch-deficient
BCC cells [40]. Harmine treatment of murine BCC cells
reduced Gli1 expression in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2D and Figure S2), and like in human
medulloblastoma cells, RNAi mediated perturbation of
Dyrk1b efficiently inhibited Gli1 protein expression, while
depletion of Dyrk1a did not. Taken together, these data
identify DYRK1B as druggable target for the inhibition of
oncogenic HH/GLI signaling.

Targeting DYRK1B inhibits HH/GLI signaling in
SMO-inhibitor resistant cells
Overcoming de novo and acquired resistance to
SMO inhibitors is a major challenge in the treatment of

need for HH inhibitors acting independent of SMO. To
map DYRK1B within the HH/GLI signaling cascade,
we performed epistasis experiments by using PTCH
and SUFU-deficient cells displaying SMO-dependent
and SMO-independent pathway activation, respectively.
In addition, we analyzed the role of DYRK1B in the
regulation of GLI1 expression in pancreatic cancer and
Ewing sarcoma cells, where TGFβ/RAS and the EWSFLI1 oncogene, respectively, control GLI1 expression
independent of canonical SMO activity (Figure 3A) [23,
24].
As a first approach we triggered SMO-independent
GLI activation in human medulloblastoma cells (DAOY)
by RNAi mediated knockdown of SUFU, a critical
negative GLI regulator acting downstream of SMO (Figure
3A)[41]. As shown in Figure 3B, SUFU-knockdown in
DAOY cells led to activation of GLI1 expression that was
resistant to vismodegib treatment. In contrast to SMO
inhibition, RNAi-mediated depletion of DYRK1B but
not of DYRK1A largely prevented GLI1 expression and
moderately reduced GLI2 expression while leaving levels
and processing of GLI3 unchanged (Figure 3C).
We confirmed the role of Dyrk1b in the regulation of
Gli1 using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in
either Ptch or Sufu. In line with Dyrk1b acting downstream
of Smo, Dyrk1b inhibition by harmine treatment reduced
Gli1 expression in Ptch-/- and Sufu-/- MEF (Figure 3D),
while vismodegib abolished Gli1 expression only in Ptch/but not in Sufu-/- cells (data not shown).
In light of these findings we hypothesized that
targeting DYRK1B may represent a novel strategy to
inhibit oncogenic GLI1 activity in cancer cells with noncanonical, SMO-independent GLI1 activation. As proof
of concept we tested this hypothesis in pancreatic cancer
and Ewing sarcoma cell models. Pancreatic cancer cells
have been shown to express GLI1 in response to TGFβ
and RAS signaling independent of SMO activation [23,
42]. To test whether DYRK1B contributes to the control
of GLI1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells, we analyzed
PANC-1 cells for GLI1 expression in response to DYRK1
inhibition. PANC-1 cells display high levels of DYRK1B
and express detectable levels of GLI1 protein. GLI1
protein levels remained unaffected upon vismodegib
treatment, indicating SMO-independent GLI1 regulation
and de novo resistance to SMO targeting (Figure 3E, left
panel). Of note, RNAi targeting of DYRK1B but not of
DYRK1A resulted in loss of GLI1 protein expression and
in reduced mRNA levels of the GLI1 target BCL2 [43]
(Figure 3E right panel and 3F).
Ewing sarcoma cells harboring the EWS-FLI1
oncogenic fusion gene have been shown to express GLI1
[44] in response to direct binding of the EWS-FLI1
oncoprotein to the GLI1 promoter. Consequently, EWS
cells (here A673 cells) display SMO-independent GLI1
expression that is resistant to vismodegib treatment [24]
(Figure 3G, left panel). In agreement with the previous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

data in SUFU-deficient and pancreatic cancer cells,
inhibition of DYRK1B but not of DYRK1A reduced GLI1
protein levels (Figure 3G, right panel). Together, these
data identify DYRK1B as possible therapeutic target to
overcome SMO-inhibitor resistance in GLI1-dependent
cancer cells.

A novel DYRK1 inhibitor as potent antagonist of
HH/GLI signaling
Having identified DYRK1B as novel drug target for
the inhibition of oncogenic HH/GLI signaling, we set out
to screen for small molecule inhibitors with potent activity
against DYRK1B and pharmacological properties suitable
for in vivo administration and therapy.
To identify inhibitors of HH signaling we screened
in house kinase inhibitors for activity in Shh-light2
reporter gene assay. This led to the identification of a
novel DYRK1 inhibitor referred to as DYRKi (Figure
4A) that inhibited reporter gene activity with an IC50
of 3.7 µM (Figure 4B) without affecting viability and
inhibited the target kinase DYRK1B with an IC50 of 90
nM in extracellular in vitro ATP competition assays using
recombinant protein (data not shown). The compound
was shown to be nontoxic, and demonstrated favorable
selectivity against other kinases in the DiscoveRX
KINOMEScan (selectivity factor S (35)=0.078) (Figure S3
A-D). DYRKi demonstrated in vivo a dose proportional
exposure of up to 100 mg/kg. Administration of 100 mg/
kg resulted in a plasma concentration of ~10 µM over
8 h, and a terminal t1/2 of ~3 h, demonstrating suitable
pharmacokinetics for once daily dosage (Figure S3 A, B).
Importantly and in line with our DYRK1B RNAi
data, DYRKi treatment of SAG-treated SUFU-positive
(WT MB +SAG) and untreated SUFU-depleted (∆Sufu
MB) human medulloblastoma cells prevented GLI1
mRNA expression at comparable IC50 concentrations
of 1.16 µM and 1.04 µM, respectively (Figure 4C). By
contrast, vismodegib treatment prevented GLI1 expression
only in SUFU-positive cells but not in SUFU-depleted
SMO-inhibitor resistant cells (Figure 4D). DYRKitreated cells were viable and fully responsive to non-HH
stimuli such as EGF, indicating that DYRKi-mediated
HH-pathway inhibition is not due to unspecific cytotoxic
effects of the compound (Figure S4). Furthermore,
DYRKi treatment did not significantly change DYRK1B
protein levels in DAOY, PANC-1 or A673 cells (Figure
S5). Analysis of GLI1 protein expression in SUFUpositive and SUFU-deficient human medulloblastoma
cells (Figure 4E, 4F) and Sufu knockout mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (Figure 4G) further corroborated the potent
activity of DYRKi to inhibit GLI activity in SMOinhibitor sensitive and resistant cells. Notable, addition of
the clinically approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
largely reversed the negative effect of DYRK1 inhibition

DISCUSSION

on GLI1 and GLI2 by DYRKi (Figure 4H), suggesting
that DYRK1B plays a critical role in preventing the
GLI activator forms GLI1 and GLI2 from proteasomemediated degradation, consistent with the documented
role of DYRK1B in protein stabilization [34]. Since we
were unable to show direct phosphorylation of GLI1 by
DYRK1B (data not shown), the detailed mechanisms
of GLI1 (and GLI2) protein stabilization by DYRK1B
remain unclear.

The widespread aberrant activation of HH/GLI
in human cancers and its causal role in tumor initiation
and growth explain the attractiveness and rationale of
targeting HH/GLI signaling in cancer. Most efforts to
identify selective HH pathway inhibitors have so far
concentrated on targeting the essential pathway effector
SMO. In 2012, the FDA approved the first-in class oral
SMO inhibitor vismodegib for the treatment of advanced
and metastatic basal cell carcinoma with striking
therapeutic efficacy, though severe side effects and the
rapid development of acquired SMO inhibitor resistance
pose significant limitations to the clinical application of
drugs targeting SMO [10, 11, 48]. Furthermore, clinical
trials on colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer failed to
demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of SMO inhibition [13],
which may at least in part be due to SMO-independent
activation of oncogenic GLI activity by for instance
TGFβ, RAS, PI3K/AKT/S6K or genetic deletion of the
GLI repressor SUFU (reviewed in [7, 49]). Together,
these potential shortfalls of SMO inhibitors call for
the identification of targets regulating oncogenic GLI
downstream of SMO.
In the present study, we identified DYRK1B as
cell-autonomous positive regulator of GLI activity.
We have shown that genetic and chemical perturbation
of DYRK1B represses the expression of the GLI1
oncogene in a variety of settings, including human brain
and pancreatic cancer and murine basal cell carcinoma
cells. Importantly, DYRK1B targeting abolished GLI1
expression in SMO-inhibitor sensitive and SMO-inhibitor
resistant cells including SUFU deficient medulloblastoma,
GLI1-dependent pancreatic cancer [16, 23] and Ewing
sarcoma cells expressing GLI1 in response to the EWSFLI1 oncoprotein [24, 44]. This places DYRK1B function
downstream of SMO/SUFU to promote GLI1 oncogene
expression.
Mechanistically, we propose that D1B enhances the
stability of GLI activator forms [50], as inhibition of the
proteasome machinery neutralizes the negative regulatory
effect of DYRK1B targeting on GLI1/2 expression.
Whether stabilization of GLI1 and GLI2 involves direct
phosphorylation by DYRK1B or depends on alternative
indirect mechanisms is unclear at present and requires
future in-depth analysis of post-translational GLI
modifications.
In light of the disappointing outcomes of several
clinical trials with SMO inhibitors, targeting oncogenic
GLI transcription factors downstream of SMO has
emerged as promising alternative therapeutic strategy.
Other non-SMO Hedgehog pathway inhibitors including
kinase inhibitors or epigenetic modifiers [19, 31, 51],
inhibitors of GLI DNA binding and/or post-transcriptional
GLI activation [28, 30, 52-54], or GLI antagonists with
yet unidentified targets have recently been reported

DYRK1B targeting impairs oncogenic growth of
GLI-dependent pancreatic cancer cells
In previous work, others and we have provided
evidence for a critical tumorigenic role of GLI1 in
pancreatic cancer cells, including reduced formation
of tumor-initiating spheroids in vitro and impaired in
vivo tumor growth [45-47]. Having shown that GLI1
expression in PANC-1 cells depends on DYRK1B, we
therefore addressed whether inhibition of DYRK1B is
able to phenocopy the anti-tumorigenic effect of GLI1
inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. We first monitored the
effect of DYRK1B inhibition on tumor-initiating spheroid
formation of GLI1-dependent yet SMO-inhibitor resistant
PANC-1 cells in 3D cultures [46]. As shown in Figure 5A
and 5B, treatment with the SMO inhibitor vismodegib did
not affect clonogenic growth, while harmine and DYRKi
treatment significantly reduced large spheroid formation.
Pre-treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with DYRKi
or vismodegib prior to seeding into 3D cultures for
clonogenic growth assays yielded similar results. Again,
DYRKi reduced the formation of tumor-initiating spheres
while vismodegib did not (Figure S6). In agreement with
the critical role of DYRK1B in GLI1 expression, RNAinterference against DYRK1B but not against DYRK1A
inhibited clonogenic growth of GLI1-dependent pancreatic
cancer cells. Note that neither chemical nor genetic
inhibition of DYRK1B significantly reduced viability of
cells in planar cultures and equal numbers of viable cells
were used in all assays.
To test the in vivo relevance of these data, we
performed xenograft assays with two distinct GLI1dependent pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1 and
L3.6pl) [46]. In line with in vitro data, stable knockdown
of DYRK1B effectively abolished the engraftment
and in vivo tumor growth of PANC-1 and L3.6pl
pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 5C, 5D). In addition, oral
administration of DYRKi significantly reduced in vivo
tumor growth of pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 5E).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
inhibition of DYRK1B efficiently represses GLI1
expression and reduces the malignant properties of GLI1
dependent cancer cells including pancreatic cancer cells
with resistance to SMO inhibitors.

prevent the formation of tumor-initiating spheres. Sphere formation shown in A) was quantitatively analyzed and the number of tumorinitiating (ti) spheres plotted in B). For all experiments, identical numbers of live cells were seeded into 3D matrix cultures. We noted that

[29], supporting the promising therapeutic potential of
targeting oncogenic GLI transcription factors in settings
where SMO-inhibition is inefficient. However, except
for arsenic trioxide and pyrvinium [51, 52, 54], lack of
suitable pharmacological properties, limited potency or
toxicity is a concern for many of the GLI antagonists
identified. The identification of DYRKi as a novel DYRK1
inhibitor with suitable pharmacokinetics and anti-GLI1
activity provides proof-of-concept for oncogenic HH/GLI
inhibition by DYRK1B targeting in malignancies with de
novo or acquired SMO inhibitor resistance.
Previous studies have already highlighted the
complex regulatory role of DYRK family members in
HH/GLI signaling. For instance, DYRK2 can directly
phosphorylate GLI2 thereby promoting its degradation,
while overexpression of DYRK1A can enhance GLI
transcriptional activity. DYRK1B, the closest homologue
of DYRK1A, can act downstream of RAS to prevent
autocrine and promote paracrine HH signaling in RAS
mutant cancer cells [35]. The same study has also shown
a repressive effect of oncogenic RAS and its downstream
effector DYRK1B on GLI expression, contrasting our
findings and those of other independent studies that
support a GLI-activating role of DYRK1B and RAS,
respectively [23, 42, 55]. Whether this discrepancy is
due to different experimental conditions (e.g. serum,
confluency, cell line passages, transient versus stable longterm knockdown approaches) is unclear.
Our findings that DYRK1B rather than DYRK1A
acts as critical positive regulator of HH/GLI add another
example of HH/GLI regulation by DYRK kinases with
possible therapeutic relevance and also highlight the
highly complex and context-dependent control of HH/
GLI activity [7].
Using SMO-inhibitor resistant pancreatic cancer
cells we also confirm a previous report showing that
DYRK1B targeting in pancreatic cancer cells has
pronounced therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo,
though the molecular mechanisms including the link to
HH/GLI signaling remained unidentified in this study
[56]. In the present study we show that interfering with
DYRK1B dramatically impairs SMO-independent GLI1
expression in RAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells and
phenocopies the anti-tumorigenic effect of GLI1 targeting
[16]. Since GLI activator function is critical for tumorinitiating cells [16, 25, 25, 57] and also involved in the
development of Ras-driven murine pancreatic cancer
within the epithelial tumor compartment [23, 47, 55],
we speculate that chemical DYRK1B inhibition may be
able to repress the growth of pancreatic cancer due to
negative regulation of SMO-independent GLI1 in tumor
and tumor-initiating cells, consistent with the abrogation
of tumor engraftment in response to genetic DYRK1B
inhibition. Intriguingly, up to 10 percent of pancreatic
cancers harbor genomic amplifications of DYRK1B
and display DYRK1B overexpression in the epithelial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

compartment of the tumors [33]. Targeting DYRK1B may
therefore overcome the inefficient therapeutic response of
pancreatic cancer patients to SMO-inhibitors that target
canonical paracrine signaling in the tumor environment
rather than non-canonical GLI activity in the epithelial
tumor compartment [58-61]. It will be important to address
in future studies whether DYRK1B overexpression and
amplification correlate with increased epithelial GLI1
protein levels and therapeutic response to DYRK1B
inhibition in patient samples.
In summary, the identification of DYRK1B as drug
target for the inhibition of oncogenic HH/GLI signaling
in SMO-inhibitor resistant cancers and the introduction
of DYRKi as novel DYRK1B inhibitor with suitable
pharmacologic properties provide a basis for future efforts
to translate these findings to clinical testing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and inhibitors
DAOY cells (American Type Culture Collection,
ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown as described
previously [38]. BSZ2 cells were grown as described in
[40] and PANC-1 (ATCC) cells as described in [46].
Ptch-/- and Sufu-/- embryonic fibroblasts were
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), antibiotics and for Sufu-/- cells also with
L-glutamine. During assays and treatments of confluent
cells, FBS was reduced to 0.5%. For 3-dimensional (3D)
cultures, 5 x 103 cells were seeded in 12-well plates as
described previously [62]. 3D spheroid cultures were
grown for 4-6 weeks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Colony formation was documented
on a stereomicroscope with Cell^D Image capture system
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using Colony
Counter Software (Microtec Nition, Chiba, Japan).
Smoothened agonist SAG (Axxora, Farmingdale NY,
USA), harmine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), vismodegib, cyclopamine (LC Laboratories,
Woburn, MA, USA), GANT61 (Merck Chemicals Ltd.,
Darmstadt, Germany) and DYRKi were dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

RNA interference and lentiviral transduction
Stable RNAi knockdown experiments were
performed by lentiviral shRNA transductions as
described in [16]. The following shRNA constructs
selected from the Mission TRC shRNA library (Sigma)
were used: shRNA DYRK1A (TRCN0000000526),
shRNA DYRK1B#1 (TRCN0000002139), shRNA
DYRK1B#2 (TRCN0000355722), shRNA DYRK1B#3
(TRCN0000355721), shSUFU (TRCN0000019466) and

DYRK1B-Kinase Assay was performed at Reaction
Biology Corporation (Reaction Biology Corp., Malvern,
PA, USA) according to following protocol. The substrate
DYRKtide was prepared in fresh Base Reaction Buffer
(20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA,
0.02% Brij35, 0.02 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM
DTT, 1% DMSO) and required cofactors were added.
Recombinant DYRK1B was added to the substrate
solution and gently mixed. Compound dilution series in
DMSO were added to the reaction, followed 20 min later
by addition of a mixture of ATP and 33P ATP (specific
activity 0.01 µCi/µl final) to a final concentration of
10 µM. Reactions were carried out at 25°C for 120
min, followed by spotting the reactions onto P81 ion
exchange filter paper. Unbound phosphate was removed
by extensive washing of the filters in 0.75% phosphoric
acid. After subtraction of background derived from control
reactions containing inactive enzyme, kinase activity data
were expressed as the percent remaining kinase activity in
test samples compared to vehicle (DMSO) reactions. IC50
values and curve fits were obtained using Prism (Graph
Pad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Synthesis of DYRKi was done as follows: to
a solution of 2-(2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-5-yl)-1,3thiazole-4-carboxylic acid (1.00 g. 4.04 mmol) in
20 ml N,N-dimethylformamide, 5-(trifluoromethyl)1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-amine (895 mg, 4.45 mmol),
2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) (1.53 g, 4.04 mmol),
4-dimethylaminopyridine (49 mg, 0.40 mmol) and
N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.76 ml, 10.11 mmol)
were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 72
h at room temperature, poured into ice water and the
formed precipitate dried and purified by flash column
chromatography (DCM/MeOH 95:5 to 0:100). The crude
product was suspended in Et2O, filtered and dried. The
product was obtained as a white solid (1.07 g, 2.49 mmol,
62 % yield). mp: 232.5; 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6)

RNA isolation, qPCR and Western blot analysis
Total RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent
(Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA)
followed by LiCl purification. Precipitated and purified
RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer´s instructions.
qPCR was done on a Rotorgene Q (Qiagen, Venlo,
Netherlands) using GoTaq qPCR Mastermix reagent
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). HH target genes were
identified with primers as described in [16].
For Western blot analysis, proteins were
visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies in combination with enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (GE Health Care,
Chalfont St Giles, United Kingdom). The following
antibodies were used: anti-GLI1 (V812; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-GLI2 (H-300,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-GLI3
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-DYRK1A,
anti-DYRK1B (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SUFU
(C-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT3 (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), anti-STAT5 (3H7, Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-Beta Catenin (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-ACTB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)

HH/GLI reporter assays
2.5 x 104 Gli Reporter - NIH3T3 cells (AMS
Biotechnology Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom)
were seeded per well into a white 96 well plate. After
overnight incubation, compounds were added for 1h
prior to HH pathway stimulation with 1 µg/ml murine
SHH (R&D Systems). After incubation for 24h the cells
were investigated for viability using CellTiter-FluorTM
Kit (Promega) and for reporter gene activity using ONEGlo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega).

Identification and synthesis of the DYRK1
inhibitor DYRKi
We applied the KINOMEscan™ screening platform
to quantify interactions between test compounds and
more than 450 human kinases and disease relevant mutant
variants. The assay was performed at DiscoveRX (San
Diego, CA, USA) according to the protocol description
available at http://www.discoverx.com/targets/kinasetarget-biology. The Image shown in Figure S3 was
