Abstract
BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 are key players in cellular tolerance to chemotherapeutic agents, including
camptothecin, cisplatin, and PARP inhibitor. The N-terminal segment of BRCA2 interacts with PALB2, thus
contributing to the formation of the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex. To understand the role played by
BRCA2 in this complex, we deleted its N-terminal segment and generated BRCA2DN mutant cells. Although
previous studies have suggested that BRCA1–PALB2 plays a role in the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA-damage
sites, BRCA2DN mutant cells displayed a considerably milder phenotype than did BRCA2/ null-deﬁcient
cells. We hypothesized that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of BRCA2 might compensate for a defect in
BRCA2DN that prevented stable interaction with PALB2. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted the DBD of
BRCA2 in wild-type and BRCA2DN cells. Remarkably, although the resulting BRCA2DDBD cells displayed a
moderate phenotype, the BRCA2DNþDDBD cells displayed a very severe phenotype, as did the BRCA2/ cells,
suggesting that the N-terminal segment and the DBD play a substantially overlapping role in the functionality
of BRCA2. We also showed that the formation of both the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex and the DBD is
required for efﬁcient recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites. Our study revealed the essential role played
by both the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex and the DBD in the functionality of BRCA2, as each can
compensate for the other in the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites. This knowledge adds to our
ability to accurately predict the efﬁcacy of antimalignant therapies for patients carrying mutations in the
BRCA2 gene. Cancer Res; 74(3); 797–807. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Homologous recombination plays a central role in maintaining genomic DNA as well as cellular tolerance to various
DNA-damaging agents (1, 2). Speciﬁcally, homologous recombination restores stalled replication at damaged template
strands by using the intact sister chromatid as a template for
DNA synthesis (3–6) and repairs any double-strand breaks
(DSB) that may occur in one of the sister chromatids during
replication or as a result of chemotherapeutic treatments
with camptothecin, cisplatin, and PARP inhibitor. Individual

homologous recombination factors contribute in different
ways to various types of homologous recombination (7, 8). In
homologous recombination–dependent DSB repair, nucleases
initiate homologous recombination by processing DSBs to
generate 30 overhangs, followed by the polymerization of
RAD51 recombinase on the overhang (9–11). The resulting
RAD51 polymer is responsible for homology search and subsequent strand exchange with intact homologous duplex DNA.
RAD51 is required for every type of homologous recombination
reaction, and inactivation of RAD51 in the chicken DT40 cell
line causes numerous spontaneous chromosomal breaks (12).
The polymerization of RAD51 is strictly regulated by a number
of RAD51 mediator proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2,
Gemin2 (13), the 5 RAD51 paralogs, RAD52, SFR1, and SWS1
(14, 15).
The breast-cancer-susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) encodes
a tumor-suppressor protein carrying 3,418 amino acids.
Although the overall amino-acid identity between the human
and the chicken BRCA2 protein is only 40%, several regions
are conserved, including the N-terminal segment (approximately 100 amino acids), 8 BRC motifs, a carboxy-proximal
region containing a DNA/DSS1-binding (DDB) domain, and the
C-terminal end (16). The BRC motifs, the DDB domain, and the
C-terminal end may involve RAD51 loading onto DNA, an
association with damaged DNA sites, and an interaction with

RAD51, respectively (17–22). We and others have previously
reported on BRCA2-null–deﬁcient DT40 cells (hereafter called
BRCA2/ cells), the DT40 cells that express a mutant BRCA2
protein truncated at the C-terminal of the BRC3 motif
(BRCA2BRC3tr cells; refs. 14, 15, 23, and 24), as well as the DT40
cells that carry the deletion of the C-terminal end (BRCA2DC
cells; ref. 17). BRCA2BRC3tr and BRCA2DC cells displayed a
signiﬁcantly milder phenotype than did BRCA2/ cells.
Likewise, BRCA2BRC3tr mice can survive to adulthood, whereas BRCA2/ mice died early in embryogenesis (25). These
observations, as well as, other reports (26) suggest that
neither the DDB domain nor the C-terminal end are absolutely essential for promoting homologous recombination by
BRCA2. The contribution of the N-terminal segment to DNAdamage tolerance is unclear, because mutant cells lacking
only this segment in the endogenous BRCA2 gene have not
yet been documented.
PALB2 was originally identiﬁed as a protein that physically
interacts at the N-terminal segment of BRCA2 (27, 28). Mutations in the BRCA2 and PALB2 genes cause the Fanconi anemia
subtypes FA-D1 and FA-N, respectively (28–31). These observations reveal a possible functional interaction between
BRCA2 and PALB2. Moreover, PALB2 binds directly to BRCA1
(32, 33) irrespective of DNA damage, indicating the stability of
the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex. However, it is unclear
whether or not the role of PALB2 in homologous recombination is entirely dependent on BRCA2. In fact, puriﬁed PALB2 is
able to promote RAD51-dependent strand exchange in the
absence of BRCA2 (34, 35). The biological signiﬁcance of the
BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex in homologous recombination remains to be investigated.
We undertook a comprehensive genetic study to address the
following 2 questions: (i) Does the functionality of PALB2 totally
depend on BRCA2? (16) What role does the BRCA1–BRCA2–
PALB2 complex play in the promotion of homologous recombination by BRCA2? (16) To address the ﬁrst question, we
created PALB2/ and BRCA2//PALB2/ cells. The data
indicate that the role played by PALB2 in homologous recombination is totally dependent on BRCA2. This echoes studies
showing that the role played by BRCA1 in homologous recombination is dependent on BRCA2 (14). To address the second
question, we deleted the BRCA2 N-terminal segment in wildtype, BRCA2BRC3tr, and BRCA2DDBD cells. Although the resulting

BRCA2DN cells displayed only modest phenotypes, the
BRCA2DNþBRC3tr, BRCA2DNþDDBD, and BRCA2/ cells displayed
very severe (and indistinguishable) phenotypes. In summary,
our genetic data reveal an interdependency among BRCA1,
BRCA2, and PALB2, wherein the promotion of homologous
recombination by PALB2 as well as by BRCA1 requires BRCA2,
and the full functionality of BRCA2 is enhanced by the BRCA1–
PALB2–BRCA2 complex. Moreover, the BRCA1–PALB2–
BRCA2 complex and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of BRCA2
play substantially overlapping roles in the recruitment of
BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, cell culture, and DNA transfection
DT40 cells were cultured as described by Sonoda and
colleagues (12). DNA transfection and selection were performed as described previously (36). A description of DT40
mutants used in this study is provided in Table 1.
Western blot
The antibodies used to detect the green ﬂuorescent protein
(GFP) in the immunoblotting assay were polyclonal rabbit
anti-GFP (MBL) and donkey anti-rabbit HRP (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The antibodies used to detect the BRCA2 protein were
the same as those used previously (24).
Flow cytometric analysis
To measure growth kinetics, cells were counted daily using
ﬂow cytometric analysis, as described previously (37).
Measurement of cell sensitivity to damaging agents
To measure cellular sensitivity, cells were exposed for 1 day
to mitomycin C (Sigma), and for 3 days to camptothecin
(TopoGEN), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin; Nippon Kayaku), etoposide (Funakoshi), and olaparib (inhibitor
of PARP; JS Research Chemical), or irradiated with ionizing
radiation (137Cs). The number of cells was measured at 72
hours using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega) or counted with FACScan (BD Biosciences). Sensitivity was calculated by dividing the number of surviving
cells treated with damaging agents by the number of untreated cells (14, 38).

Overlapping Functions among BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2

Immunoﬂuorescent visualization of RAD51 subnuclear
focus formation
Cells were collected on a slide glass using Cytospin3
(Shandon). Cells were ﬁxed by 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 minutes, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% NP-40
in PBS for 10 minutes. Fixed cells were stained with rabbit
polyclonal anti-human RAD51 (1:1,000, CALBIOCHEM; EMD
Biosciences) for 1 hour, then with anti-rabbit Ig Alexa Fluor
488 (1:3,000; Molecular Probes) for 1 hour. Slides were
stained and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories). The number of RAD51 foci was
counted in a minimum of 100 morphologically intact cells
at each time point after gamma irradiation. Images were
taken with an Olympus BX-61 microscope (Olympus Corp.)
with a CoolSNAP CCD camera unit (Photometrics) and
Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices). Subsequent
adjustment and resizing of images were done with Adobe
Photoshop (Adobe Systems).
Immunoﬂuorescent visualization of GFP-tagged protein
recruitment
To visualize BRCA2 in immunocytochemical analysis, we
inserted a GFP tag into the C-terminal end of an endogeneous BRCA2 allelic gene. To stain the GFP-tagged proteins,
we used rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (1:1,000; MBL) for 1 hour,
then anti-rabbit Ig Alexa Fluor 488 for 1 hour (1:3,000;
Molecular Probes).
Chromosome analysis of mitotic cells
To enrich mitotic cells, cells were treated with 0.1 mg/m:
colcemid (Invitrogen) for 3 hours and then ﬁxed. Metaphase
spreads were prepared as described previously (12). Additional details are provided in Supplementary material and
methods.

Results
PALB2/ cells display a signiﬁcantly milder phenotype
than do BRCA2/ cells
We generated recombinant plasmids to disrupt the PALB2
gene by inserting selection markers in exon 2 of the PALB2 gene
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). The disruption of the PALB2 gene
was veriﬁed by genomic Southern blotting and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1B and
S1C). PALB2/ cells exhibited a milder phenotype than did
BRCA2/ cells in terms of both cell-cycle kinetics and spontaneously arising chromosomal aberrations in mitotic cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S2; ref. 14).
We assessed the role played by PALB2 in the DNA-damage
response by measuring the cellular sensitivity of PALB2/
cells to various DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 1A). As with
BRCA2/ cells, PALB2/ cells showed an increased sensitivity to a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents, including
ionizing radiation, an inhibitor of PARP (olaparib), the topoisomerase poisons (camptothecin and etoposide) and chemical-crosslinking agents [cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)), and mitomycin C; Fig. 1A]. In addition to this
hypersensitivity, decreased homologous recombination–
mediated DSB repair in the SCneo construct (Fig. 1B; ref. 14)

www.aacrjournals.org

indicated that PALB2 plays a role in general homologous
recombination, as does BRCA2 (14, 39–43). It should be noted
that the phenotype of the PALB2/ cells was signiﬁcantly
milder than that of the BRCA2/ cells.
To analyze the functionality of PALB2 as a RAD51 mediator, we analyzed RAD51 subnuclear focus formation at 3
hours after ionizing radiation (Fig. 1C and D). The loss of
PALB2 diminished the induction of RAD51 focus formation,
which observation agrees with the phenotype of PALB2depleted mammalian cells (44). Thus, PALB2 contributes to
homologous recombination as a RAD51 mediator in DT40 as
well as in mammalian cells. The loss of PALB2 had a lesser
impact on RAD51 focus formation than did the loss of
BRCA2. In conclusion, PALB2 and BRCA2 play a role in
general homologous recombination as a RAD51 mediator,
with PALB2 contributing to homologous recombination to a
lesser extent than BRCA2.
The deletion of the PALB2 gene has no impact on the
phenotype of BRCA2/ cells
The phenotypic similarity between BRCA2/ and
PALB2/ clones as RAD51 mediators led us to explore a
possible functional interaction between BRCA2 and PALB2.
To this end, we generated BRCA2//PALB2/ cells. The
BRCA2/ and BRCA2//PALB2/ clones displayed a very
similar phenotype in terms of both proliferation kinetics
(Supplementary Fig. S3) and spontaneous chromosomal
aberrations (Table 2). This suggests that PALB2 requires
BRCA2 to maintain chromosomal integrity. Furthermore,
the inactivation of PALB2 had no obvious impact on the
sensitivity of the BRCA2/ cells to any of the DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 1A). This observation reveals that the
functionality of PALB2 in the DNA-damage response is
totally dependent on BRCA2. This also echoes the fact that
the functionality of BRCA1, the 5 RAD51 paralogs, RAD52,
SFR1, and SWS1 in homologous recombination is totally
dependent on BRCA2 (14, 15).
Although BRCA2DN and BRCA2BRC3tr cells show modest
phenotypes, BRCA2DNþBRC3tr cells show a very severe
phenotype
Because the N-terminal segment physically interacts with
PALB2, which thereby mediates a complex formation between
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (27, 32, 33), we next explored the function of
the N-terminal segment by deleting exons 3 to 7 (encoding
amino acids 23 to 209) in the endogenous BRCA2 gene (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We deleted the same N-terminal segment
in the BRCA2BRC3tr cells, thereby generating BRCA2DNþBRC3tr
cells. To assess the stability of the BRCA2BRC3tr and
BRCA2DNþBRC3tr proteins, we transiently transfected transgenes encoding these truncated proteins tagged at the Cterminal end with the GFP gene into DT40 cells and measured
the expression of the transgenes by Western blotting using
anti-GFP antibody (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The data indicated that the deletion of the N-terminal region does not affect
the stability of the BRCA2BRC3tr protein.
The BRCA2DN cells proliferated with nearly normal kinetics,
showing only a slight increase in the number of spontaneous

chromosomal aberrations (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table
S2). Likewise, the BRCA2DN mutant cells displayed a considerably lower sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 2A)
and a more efﬁcient homologous recombination (Fig. 2B) than
did the BRCA2/ cells. Thus, although previous studies have
suggested that BRCA1–PALB2 is essential for the recruitment
of BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites (27, 32, 33), even in the
absence of a tight physical association with BRCA1–PALB2,
the BRCA2DN protein can still signiﬁcantly contribute to
homologous recombination. The data are reminiscent of the
fact that although RAP80 was shown to be essential for the
recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA-damage sites by immunocytochemical analysis, even in the absence of RAP80, BRCA1
protein can still fully promote homologous recombination
(45). Accordingly, the physical association of BRCA2 with

800

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

BRCA1–PALB2 might not play an important role in functionality of BRCA2. Alternatively, a part of the BRCA2
protein other than the N-terminal segment might compensate for the missing physical association.
To address the latter possibility, we generated
BRCA2DNþBRC3tr cells. In contrast with the very mild phenotypes
of the BRCA2DN and BRCA2BRC3tr cells, the BRCA2DNþBRC3tr cells
displayed a very severe phenotype, whereas the BRCA2DNþBRC3tr
and BRCA2/ clones showed a similar number of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations (Table 2). Moreover, the
BRCA2DNþBRC3tr and BRCA2/ clones displayed the same
degree of sensitivity to all DNA-damaging agents tested (Fig.
3A and Supplementary Fig. S4). These observations support the
idea that either the N-terminal region or the truncated part of
the BRCA2BRC3tr protein is sufﬁcient for signiﬁcant promotion

Overlapping Functions among BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2

Although BRCA2DN and BRCA2DDBD clones show a modest
phenotype, BRCA2DNþDDBD cells show a very severe
phenotype
The next question was, which truncated sequences of the
BRCA2BRC3tr protein compensated for the absence of the Nterminal segment in the BRCA2DN protein? We hypothesized
that the DBD (19) might provide the answer. To test this
hypothesis, we disrupted the DBD in BRCA2DN as well as in
wild-type cells and generated BRCA2DNþDDBD and BRCA2DDBD
clones. We achieved the disruption of the DBD by deleting
nucleotide sequences encoding 19 amino acids included in two
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding folds (amino acids
3009 to 3017 together with 3074 to 3083) in the endogenous
BRCA2 gene. Deletion was conﬁrmed by Southern blotting and
RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). These deletions had no effect on the stability and the cellular distribution
of the BRCA2DN, BRCA2DDBD, and BRCA2DNþDDBD proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S2E and S6). The mutation that we generated in DBD domain does not affect the distribution of BRCA2
protein, which is consistent with the recent publication in (46).
The BRCA2DDBD and BRCA2DN cells showed only moderate
increases in the number of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations (Table 2) and in sensitivity to DNA damage (Figs. 2A
and 3B), which moderate phenotype was in marked contrast to
the very severe phenotype of the BRCA2/ cells. Likewise,
signiﬁcant numbers of RAD51 foci induced by ionizing radiation were detected in these mutant cells, which ﬁnding is in
marked contrast to the virtual absence of RAD51 foci induced
by ionizing radiation in the BRCA2/ cells (Fig. 2C and D).
Remarkably, the combined mutations of BRCA2DN and
BRCA2DDBD (BRCA2DNþDDBD) caused a phenotype very similar
to that of the BRCA2/ cells in terms of spontaneously arising
chromosomal breaks (Table 2), capability of homologous
recombination–mediated DSB repair in SCneo (Fig. 2B), and
RAD51 focus formation induced by ionizing radiation (Fig. 2C
and D).
We measured cellular sensitivity to camptothecin, cisplatin,
etoposide, ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, and olaparib,
comparing between BRCA2DN, BRCA2DDBD, BRCA2DNþDDBD,
and BRCA2/ cells (Figs. 2A, 3B, and Supplementary Fig.
S4). BRCA2DDBD cells were slightly more sensitive to these
DNA-damaging agents than BRCA2DN cells and showed a
phenotype similar to that of BRCA2BRC3tr cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the combined mutations of BRCA2DN and BRCA2DDBD
caused a synergistic increase in cellular sensitivity (Fig. 3B), as
seen in the combined mutations of BRCA2DN and BRCA2BRC3tr
(Fig. 3A). This indicates that the N-terminal segment of BRCA2
and the DBD of BRCA2 have substantially overlapping functions in homologous recombination. Remarkably, the
BRCA2DNþDDBD and BRCA2/ clones displayed the same
degree of sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents, indicating
that either the N-terminal segment or the DBD is sufﬁcient for
the promotion of homologous recombination by BRCA2. It is
possible that the function shared by the N-terminal segment
and the DBD is the physical association with DNA-damage
sites, because this association can be achieved via an interaction between the N-terminal segment and the BRCA1–PALB2
complex as well as via the DBD of BRCA2 (19, 33).

www.aacrjournals.org

The N-terminal segment and the DBD work together to
recruit the BRCA2 protein to DNA-damage sites
We hypothesized that the N-terminal segment as well as the
DBD might contribute to the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNAdamage sites. To test this hypothesis, we visualized the recruitment of BRCA2 by inserting DNA sequences encoding a GFP
tag into the endogenous BRCA2wt, BRCA2DN, BRCA2DDBD, and
BRCA2DNþDDBD genes, measuring GFP-focus formation in the
resulting wild-type, BRCA2DN, BRCA2DDBD, and BRCA2DNþDDBD
cells after ionizing radiation (Fig. 3C and D). BRCA2 recruitment to DNA-damage sites was impaired in the BRCA2DN and
BRCA2DDBD mutants. However, we observed a few clear foci
in the BRCA2DN and BRCA2DDBD cells, which observation is
consistent with the tolerance of these mutant cells to the DNAdamaging agents described above. In agreement with the nullphenotype of BRCA2DNþDDBD cells, they showed no detectable
BRCA2 recruitment. In summary, the BRCA2 protein can
accumulate at DNA-damage sites even if it loses either its
N-terminal segment or its DBD (Fig. 3C and D). Furthermore,
either the PALB2 protein or the DBD is essential for the
recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites.
The recruitment of BRCA2 by the N-terminal segment
requires both BRCA1 and PALB2
The N-terminal segment of BRCA2 has been shown to
perform intrinsic transcriptional activities (16, 47) and to
have an association with PALB2 (33). To selectively analyze
the latter function, we generated BRC3-truncated BRCA2
(BRCA2BRC3tr) transgenes carrying point mutations (W31R and
W31C) that speciﬁcally inhibit the interaction between BRCA2
and PALB2 (27). The ectopic expression of the BRCA2BRC3tr
transgene, but not the resulting BRCA2W31RþBRC3tr or
BRCA2W31CþBRC3tr mutant transgenes, reversed the phenotype
of the BRCA2/ cells, including decreases in cellular tolerance
to camptothecin and cisplatin (Fig. 4A). Thus, the interaction
with PALB2 may be essential for the promotion of homologous
recombination by the BRCA2BRC3tr protein. To test this idea, we
ectopically expressed the BRCA2BRC3tr transgene in BRCA2/
and PALB2//BRCA2/ clones. The BRCA2BRC3tr transgene
signiﬁcantly suppressed the mutant phenotype in the
BRCA2/ cells but not in the PALB2//BRCA2/ cells
(Fig. 4A), indicating that PALB2 is required to promote
homologous recombination by BRCA2BRC3tr. Taking into
account the fact that BRCA2 is required for the promotion
of homologous recombination by PALB2 (Fig. 1), we conclude that there is a previously unappreciated functional
interdependency between BRCA2 and PALB2.
Because PALB2 mediates between BRCA1 and BRCA2 to
form a complex, the BRCA2BRC3tr protein might also require
BRCA1 to promote homologous recombination. To test this
idea, we ectopically expressed the BRCA2BRC3tr transgene in
BRCA1//BRCA2/ cells. The BRCA2BRC3tr transgene failed
to reverse the mutant phenotype of the BRCA1//BRCA2/
cells (Fig. 4A). We therefore conclude that the contribution of
the BRCA2BRC3tr protein to homologous recombination is
entirely dependent on the stable complex formed by the
BRCA2BRC3tr protein with both BRCA1 and PALB2. These 2
proteins might thus be essential for the recruitment of the

previously (32, 33).
To investigate the role played by the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2
complex in the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA-damage sites, we
undertook 2 experiments. First, we ectopically expressed the
GFP-tagged
BRCA2BRC3tr,
BRCA2W31RþBRC3tr,
and
W31CþBRC3tr
BRCA2
transgenes in BRCA2/ cells, exposed the
resulting cells to irradiation with ionizing radiation and then
performed immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B
and C). Second, we ectopically expressed the GFP-tagged
BRCA2BRC3tr transgene in PALB2//BRCA2/ and BRCA1//
BRCA2/ cells and performed immunostaining. The
BRCA2BRC3tr transgene, but not the BRCA2W31RþBRC3tr or the
BRCA2W31CþBRC3tr transgene, caused GFP-focus formation,
indicating that a BRCA2–PALB2 interaction is required for
efﬁcient BRCA2 focus formation. In addition, the BRCA2BRC3tr
protein was not recruited to DNA-damage sites in either the
PALB2//BRCA2/ or the BRCA1//BRCA2/ clone (Fig.
4B and C), which observation agrees with previous studies

(32, 33). We conclude that both BRCA1 and PALB2 are required
for BRCA2-focus formation when the DBD is absent.

Discussion
We have shown that although BRCA2DN and BRCA2DDBD
clones have only moderate phenotypes, the combined
DNþDDBD mutations totally abolished the functionality of
BRCA2 and resulted in synergistic increases in cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 3B). This observation
indicates that the deleted N-terminal segment and the DBD
might share a common function. This function is likely to be a
physical interaction with DNA-damage sites, because both
BRCA2DN and BRCA2DDBD cells showed compromised recruitment of mutated BRCA2 proteins to DNA-damage sites (Fig. 3C
and D). In summary, our data reveal that the N-terminal
segment and the DBD of the BRCA2 protein have overlapping
functions, most likely the physical interaction of BRCA2 with
the DNA-damage site. Conceivably, the N-terminal segment

disruption of the DBD of BRCA2. E, the BRCA2

and the DBD may collaborate for the most appropriate positioning of BRCA2 at DNA-damage sites, which positioning may
allow for the most efﬁcient promotion of RAD51 polymerization (Fig. 5).
The present genetic study provides compelling evidence that
BRCA2 and PALB2 are interdependent. This conclusion is
supported by the fact that the BRCA2/ and PALB2//
BRCA2/ cells display the same phenotype (Fig. 1). Possibly,
BRCA2 is required for the appropriate positioning of PALB2 at
DNA-damage sites in vivo (14). The promotion of homologous
recombination by the BRCA2BRC3tr protein totally depends on
BRCA2's interaction with PALB2. This conclusion can be
drawn from 2 experiments (Fig. 4). First, the BRCA2BRC3tr
protein signiﬁcantly enhanced homologous recombination in
BRCA2/ cells but had no effect at all in PALB2//BRCA2/
cells. Second, the W31R and W31C mutations of the BRCA2
BRC3-truncated protein prevented the interaction of the
resulting mutant proteins with PALB2 and also inhibited the
promotion of homologous recombination. In summary, our
study highlights the critical role played by the interaction
between the N-terminal segment of BRCA2 and PALB2 in the
promotion of homologous recombination by both BRCA2 and
PALB2 (Fig. 5).
We previously showed that BRCA2 has an epistatic relationship with BRCA1 (14). We here show that the BRCA2BRC3tr
protein does not function at all in the absence of BRCA1 or
PALB2. These observations demonstrate previously unknown
interdependencies between BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as
between PALB2 and BRCA2. Because the BRCA1/ and
PALB2/ clones (14) displayed a stronger phenotype than
did the BRCA2DN cells, we concluded that both BRCA1 and

www.aacrjournals.org

PALB2 are able to contribute to homologous recombination,
even without the formation of a stable BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2
complex. Another question is how BRCA1 affects BRCA2- and
PALB2-mediated promotion of RAD51 polymerization. BRCA1
seems to play a role in the resection of DSBs, possibly by
counteracting the inhibitory effect of 53BP1 and Rif1 (48) on
the resection. Presumably, the functional association of BRCA1
with BRCA2 and PALB2 allows for the efﬁcient collaboration
between the BRCA1-dependent resection of DSBs and the
subsequent loading of RAD51 on the resulting overhang by
BRCA2 and PALB2.
In summary, this study, as well as our previous study (14),
uncovers the following functional relationships among BRCA1,
BRCA2, and PALB2 (Fig. 5). First, the recruitment of BRCA2 to
DNA-damage sites is promoted by a stable complex between
BRCA2 and both BRCA1 and PALB2. Second, the promotion of
RAD51 polymerization by BRCA1 and PALB2 is totally dependent on BRCA2. Third, the DBD can substitute for a defect in
the stable complex. These ﬁndings contribute to the prediction
of the efﬁcacy of antimalignant therapies on malignant tumors
carrying a variety of mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and
PALB2 genes.
