BACKGROUND: Irinotecan is cytotoxic in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). SN-38 (10-hydroxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin)
is the active metabolite of irinotecan. Attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains (pegylation) to SN-38 (EZN-2208)
increases the solubility, exposure, and half-life of SN-38. Preclinical studies demonstrated superior in vitro efficacy of EZN-2208 when
it was tested in irinotecan-refractory human CRC cell lines. METHODS: Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent CRC who had previously received 5-flurouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan were assigned to receive EZN-2208 monotherapy (9 mg=m2 on days
1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for patients with KRAS-mutant tumors only [arm A]), and patients with KRAS wild-type tumors were
randomized (2:1) to receive either EZN-2208 plus cetuximab (400 mg=m2 loading dose on day 1 followed by 250 mg=m2 weekly
starting on day 8 [arm B]) or irinotecan 125 mg=m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days plus cetuximab at the same doses indicated above
(arm C). RESULTS: The overall response rate and progression-free survival were 0% and 1.8 months, respectively, in arm A; 10.7% and
4.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-5.8 months), respectively, in arm B; and 14.3% and 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.1-5.8 months),
respectively, in arm C. EZN-2208 was well tolerated in combination with cetuximab. No statistically significant difference in survival
was observed between arm B (9.8 months; 95% CI, 7.2-11.2 months) and arm C (9.1 months; 95% CI, 6.0-13.0 months). CONCLUSIONS:
EZN-2208, either as monotherapy or in combination with cetuximab, was well tolerated in patients with refractory CRC. Overall survival and progression-free survival were similar in the cetuximab plus irinotecan arm and the EZN-2208 arm. Cancer 2013;119:4223C 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is associated with an overall survival (OS) benefit when used to treat patients
with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). It has proven efficacy in treatment-naive patients1 and in
treatment-refractory patients with CRC.2 The active metabolite of irinotecan is SN-38 (10-hydroxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin). Because of its poor solubility, SN-38 is not suitable for parenteral administration.3 Pegylation of drugs may lead to
the creation of a new compound with superior solubility, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy compared with the parent
drug4; this has been demonstrated as a clinically effective treatment strategy, as evidenced by pegylated granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),5 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin,6 and pegylated-interferon a-2b.7
EZN-2208 is a pegylated conjugate of SN-38 that is more water soluble, has a longer circulating half-life, and
produces greater therapeutic exposure of SN-38 compared with the parent compound, irinotecan.8 In vitro studies have
demonstrated that EZN-2208 is associated with activity in tumor xenografts (including the human CRC cell line HT-29)
and that it has efficacy in irinotecan-refractory tumors.9 In preclinical studies, EZN-2208 induced tumor regression in
neuroblastoma models10 and was associated with significant tumor responses in human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma

xenograft models.11 It also has been demonstrated that
EZN-2208 inhibits angiogenesis by down-regulating
heat-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a).12
A phase 1 clinical trial of EZN-2208 in solid tumors
determined that the recommended phase 2 monotherapy
dose when administered every 3 weeks was 10 mg=m2 without the use of G-CSF and 16.5 mg=m2 with G-CSF support.13 The toxicity observed was similar to that of
irinotecan, including diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, and
thrombocytopenia as the most commonly observed side
effects. Of 39 patients who received EZN-2208, among the
17 patients who had received prior irinotecan therapy, 7 had
a best overall response of either an unconfirmed partial
response or stable disease that lasted a minimum of 4 months.
A second phase 1 study evaluating the weekly dosing of
EZN-2208 (on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) determined
that the recommended phase 2 dose was 9 mg=m2.14
EZN-2208 is associated with superior in vitro efficacy
compared with irinotecan. In human CRC HT-29 tumor
xenograft models, EZN-2208 demonstrated effective antitumor inhibition in an irinotecan-resistant mouse model,
and multiple doses of EZN-2208 were associated with a
cure in 90% of the animals.9 Tumors frequently acquire resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors by overexpression of
the efflux transporter ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G).15 Preclinical studies have indicated that EZN2208 can overcome ABCG2-mediated resistance, possibly
because of the increased drug delivery of SN-38 to tumors,
by means of enhanced permeability and retention.16-18
Given the demonstrated preclinical efficacy of
EZN-2208 and its tolerability and efficacy in phase 1 testing, we undertook a phase 2 study of EZN-2208 monotherapy in patients with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant, metastatic colorectal
cancer who had prior exposure to irinotecan, and we also
conducted a randomized phase 2 study of cetuximab plus
either irinotecan or EZN-2208 in patients with KRAS
wild-type tumors who also had prior irinotecan exposure
but who were cetuximab-naive. The primary objectives
were to determine the overall response rate as well as
progression-free survival (PFS) (the latter in arms B and C
only); secondary objectives were to evaluate the duration
of response, OS, and the safety and tolerability of EZN2208 when combined with cetuximab.

(at the same dose and schedule as arm A) combined with
cetuximab at a loading dose of 400 mg=m2 on day 1, followed by 250 mg=m2 weekly, infused over 1 hour, with
standard antiemetics and antihypersensitivity prophylaxis.
Patients who were randomized to arm C received irinotecan 125 mg=m2 intravenously over 1 hour on days 1 and
8 every 21 days combined with cetuximab (at the same
dose and schedule as arm B). The doses of irinotecan and
cetuximab were derived from previous clinical trials.21 A
central randomization scheme using an interactive webbased response system was used. Randomization between
arms B and C was at a 2:1 ratio using a permutated blocks

open-label study.
Assessment of Toxicity and Response

Toxicity was graded by using the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (CTCAE).22
Dose adjustments were made depending on the toxicity
observed with each treatment cycle. Patients who received
cetuximab and experienced a CTCAE grade >2 hypersensitivity reaction had treatment with cetuximab permanently discontinued.
Within 14 days before treatment, patients were
required to undergo a complete history and physical
examination, including date and stage of CRC and of

metastases, prior cancer therapy, site(s) of metastases, performance status, and review of symptoms. Patients also
underwent the following tests: complete blood count, urinalysis, renal and hepatic function tests, electrocardiogram, pregnancy test for premenopausal women, and
electrolytes. Tumor assessments with chest roentgenogram, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance
imaging were required within 1 month before the start of
treatment, and all other tests were done no more than 2
weeks before the start of therapy. The overall response rate
was defined as the number of complete and partial
responses documented and subsequently confirmed. During the course of treatment, history and physical examination, concomitant medications, hepatic and renal

of Reporting Trials [CONSORT] diagram). Seventy-one
patients failed screening, 221 patients were assigned or
randomized, and 213 patients received treatment. Patient
demographics are listed in Table 1.
Treatment Duration and Toxicity

Patients in arm A received a median of 2 treatment cycles
(range, 1-10 treatment cycles), patients in arm B received
a median of 4 treatment cycles (range, 1-24 treatment
cycles), and patients in arm C also received a median of 4
treatment cycles (range, 1-22 treatment cycles). The median duration of drug exposure in 7 weeks in arm A, 15

Objective Radiographic Response Rate, Overall
Survival, and Time to Progression

No radiographic responses were observed in the EZN2208 monotherapy arm (ie, in those patients who had
received prior irinotecan chemotherapy, who had progressed within 3 months of prior irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy, or who had KRAS-mutant tumors).
Seventy-five patients (94%) were evaluable from arm B
(EZN-2208 plus cetuximab), and 35 patients (92%) were
evaluable from arm C (irinotecan plus cetuximab). No
complete responses were observed, and no statistically significant differences in OS or time to progression were

observed between arms B and C. The results of the
investigator-determined radiographic response for arms B
and C are provided in Table 2. The Kaplan-Meier PFS
and OS curves are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 3,
respectively. The 6-month PFS rate was 37% in arm B
(95% CI, 27%-48%) and 29% in arm C (95% CI, 14%44%).
Symptom Severity

EZN-2208 was well tolerated, both as monotherapy and
when combined with cetuximab. The grade 3 and 4
adverse events observed when patients received cetuximab
in combination with EZN-2208 were not statistically significantly different from those observed when patients
received cetuximab combined with irinotecan, as indicated in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Improvement in cancer therapeutics may be achieved
through improved drug delivery of agents with proven,
albeit modest, anticancer efficacy. SN-38, a metabolite of
irinotecan, is 100 to 1000 times more active than its parent compound.25 The poor solubility of SN-38 makes it
unsuitable as a therapeutic agent. Pegylation is a method
of linking polyethylene glycol to a small molecule; the
consequence is an improvement in the circulating half-life
of the compound coupled with associated decreased
immunogenicity.
Pegylation may also be associated with superior solubility, leading to more favorable pharmacokinetics with
an associated reduction in unwanted side effects. EZN2208 was developed as a conjugate by linking SN-38 at
the carbon 20 position with a 4-arm polyethylene glycol
(PEG) through a glycine linker. EZN is significantly
more water soluble than SN-38; the aqueous solubility of
EZN-2208 is 6.7 mg=mL equivalents of SN-38, compared with 0.0072 mg=mL for SN-38.26
In this study, EZN-2208 was not associated with
objective radiographic responses in patients with KRASmutant, metastatic CRC who had received prior irinotecan therapy. It is noteworthy that the patients in arm A
(KRAS-mutant tumors) had proven resistance to irinotecan and oxaliplatin; currently, the efficacy of EZN-2208
in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC who are irinotecannaive is not known. In a randomized comparison with
irinotecan plus cetuximab, EZN-2208 plus cetuximab
treatment was not associated with a statistically significant
difference in PFS or OS. It is not clear why this agent
did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared with
irinotecan; however, this may be related to inadequate

tumor drug distribution or possibly to unfavorable
pharmacokinetics.
Drug delivery to its target will remain an important
aspect of cancer treatment and may be 1 of the reasons for
drug resistance. Enhanced formulations of agents with
established efficacy, with a view to optimizing pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of anticancer agents, should
remain an investigative priority. Monotherapy studies of
EZN-2208 have been completed evaluating the efficacy
of the drug in the treatment of patients with breast cancer27 and pediatric tumors (including neuroblastoma)28;
in addition, there is an ongoing combination study of
EZN-2208 combined with the antivascular epithelial
growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab in solid
tumors.29 Further studies will be necessary to completely
evaluate the clinical efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in
the treatment of patients with solid tumors.
