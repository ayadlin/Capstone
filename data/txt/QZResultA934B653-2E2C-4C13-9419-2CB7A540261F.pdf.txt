Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system in humans. To
understand the molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have generated a
mouse model that spontaneously develops follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid
cancer (ThrbPV/PV mouse). This mutant mouse harbors a dominantnegative mutated thyroid
hormone receptor β (denoted PV). The PV mutation was identified in a patient with resistance to
thyroid hormone (TH). ThrbPV/PV mice exhibit highly elevated serum thyroid-stimulating
hormone levels and increased TH. We have previously shown that thyroidstimulating hormone is
required, but not sufficient to induce metastatic follicular thyroid cancer in ThrbPV/PV mice.
However, whether the elevated TH also contributes to the thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV
mice was not elucidated. To understand the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis, we blocked the
production of TH by treating ThrbPV/PV mice with propylthiouracil (ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice) and
compared the development of thyroid cancer in ThrbPV/PV-PTU and untreated ThrbPV/PV mice.
We found that thyroid tumor growth was reduced by ~42% in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared
with ThrbPV/PV mice. Analysis by bromodeoxyuridine- nuclear labeling showed decreased
incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in thyroid tumor cells of ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice, indicative of
decreased tumor cell proliferation. However, cleaved-caspase 3 staining showed no apparent
changes in apoptosis of tumor cells in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. Molecular studies identified a
marked attenuation of the PI3K–AKT–β-catenin signaling pathway that led to decreased protein
levels of cyclin D2, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice.
Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-2, a downstream target of β-catenin and a key regulator
during tumor invasion and metastasis, was also decreased. Thus, the present study uncovers a
critical role of TH in promoting the thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice via membrane
signaling events. Importantly, these findings suggest that anti-thyroid drugs could be considered as
possible therapeutic agents of thyroid cancer.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thyroid carcinoma, the most common endocrine malignancy, is on the rise worldwide
(Davies and Welch, 2006; Rego-Iraeta et al., 2009; Sassolas et al., 2009; Sipos and
Mazzaferri, 2010). Thyroid cancers are mainly follicular cell-derived neoplasms, which
include papillary thyroid carcinoma (~80% of thyroid carcinomas), follicular thyroid
carcinoma (FTC, <10%), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (~5%) and
undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma/anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (<1%) (Nikiforov, 2004;
Puxeddu et al., 2011). Several genomic abnormalities, including gene mutations (for
example, rat sarcoma oncogene, RAS and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
B1, BRAF) and genomic rearrangements (for example, rearranged during transfection protooncogene/papillary thyroid carcinoma (RET-PTC) and paired box-8/peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PAX8/PPARG) fusion gene), have been associated
with thyroid cancers (Nikiforova and Nikiforov, 2009). However, how these genetic changes
lead to thyroid cancers is not fully understood.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have
created a mouse model (ThrbPV/PV mouse) that spontaneously develops FTC (Kaneshige et
al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2002). These mutant mice bear a knock-in mutated Thrb gene
(ThrbPV) that encodes TRβPV, which has completely lost thyroid hormone (TH) binding
and transcription activity (Kaneshige et al., 2000). The TRβPV mutant was identified in a
patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (Parrilla et al., 1991). Extensive characterization
of altered signaling pathways during thyroid carcinogenesis of the ThrbPV/PV mouse has
identified activation of several tumor promoters such as β-catenin, cyclin D1, pituitary
tumor transforming gene (PTTG), steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the repression of tumor suppressors such as
PPARγ (Ying et al., 2003, 2006, 2008; Furuya et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007; Guigon et al.,
2008). These altered signaling pathways during thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice
are consistent with the changes reported in human thyroid cancers (Boelaert et al., 2003;
Weinberger et al., 2007; Saji and Ringel, 2010). Thus, the ThrbPV/PV mouse is a valid
mouse model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid carcinogenesis.

Thyroid hormones (T3 and thyroxine, T4) have a critical role in development, growth and
differentiation, and in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. They bind to thyroid hormone
nuclear receptors (TRα and TRβ) to regulate target gene transcription (Cheng et al., 2010).
In addition to mediating genomic actions, increasing lines of evidence also suggest that TH
can initiate extranuclear functions through cytosolic thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)
(Cheng et al., 2010) and/or via plasma membrane receptors (for example, integrin αvβ3)
(Bergh et al., 2005; Davis et al., 2009). TH induces proliferation of several cancer cell lines,
including breast, brain, pancreas and thyroid (Lin et al., 2007, 2009; Verga Falzacappa et al.,
2007; Glinskii et al., 2009; Yalcin et al., 2010). The ThrbPV/PV mouse, similar to a
homozygous patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (Ono et al., 1991), exhibits highly
elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the face of elevated TH (Kaneshige et al.,
2000). Recently, using a mouse-genetics approach, we have clearly demonstrated that TSH
signaling is essential, but not sufficient to induce the development of metastatic FTC (Lu et
al., 2010). However, it is unclear whether elevated TH levels also affect the thyroid
carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice. To explore the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis, we
treated ThrbPV/PV mice with the goitrogen propylthiouracil (PTU) to block TH synthesis.
We monitored the spontaneous development of thyroid cancer in these ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice
and compared it with that in untreated ThrbPV/PV mice. Here we show that inhibition of TH
synthesis by PTU treatment decreased thyroid tumor growth and delayed tumor progression
in ThrbPV/PV mice. The decreased tumor cell proliferation was attributed to a marked
attenuation of the PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, resulting in reduction of cyclin D2

to decrease tumor cell proliferation. Reduction of β-catenin-matrix metalloproteinase-2
(MMP-2) signaling contributed to delayed tumor progression. Thus, the present study shows
that TH, via membrane signaling pathways, acts to promote thyroid carcinogenesis in a
mouse model of thyroid cancer.

Results
Inhibition of thyroid hormone (TH) production by propylthiouracil (PTU) leads to the
inhibition of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) development in ThrbPV/PV mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our previous studies have shown that the development of FTC in ThrbPV/PV mice requires
the TSH proliferation signal, whereas its progression, specifically metastasis, is attributed to
the mutated TRβ (Lu et al., 2010, 2011). However, whether elevated TH levels also
contribute to the thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice is unclear. To investigate the role
of TH in FTC development in ThrbPV/PV mice, we treated ThrbPV/PV mice with PTU to
block TH synthesis starting at 2 months and continuing on the PTU diet until the mice were
killed for analyses. To confirm the effect of PTU, we measured serum levels of total T4
(TT4) and TSH in ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PVPTU mice (Figure 1). Consistent with the
previous report (Kaneshige et al., 2000), an elevated serum level of TT4 was found in
ThrbPV/PV mice (Figure 1a, TT4=19.52±1.44 μg/dl, n=10), and the TH level was greatly
suppressed (Figure 1a, ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice, TT4=1.64±0.12 μg/dl, n=10), even lower than
that of wild-type mice (WT; TT4=2.51±0.19 μg/dl, n=28, data not shown in the graph).
However, PTU treatment did not affect serum TSH levels of ThrbPV/PV mice, as indicated in
Figure 1b, in that no statistically significant differences were detected (8002±2263 ng/ml,
n=10 and 12 790±3506 ng/ml, n=8 for ThrbPV/PV mice and ThrbPV/PV-PTU, respectively).
The first evidence suggesting that TH could have a role in FTC development was the
decreased weight of thyroid tumors in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. As shown in Figure 2a, after
PTU treatment for about 6–8 months, the thyroid weight was significantly reduced by ~42%
in ThrbPV/PV-PTU as compared with ThrbPV/PV mice. Pathohistological analyses of thyroid,
heart and lung of moribund mice (age: 8–12 months) revealed a delayed tumor progression
in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared with ThrbPV/PV mice. Figure 2b shows that in
ThrbPV/PV mice, the frequencies of occurrence of capsular and vascular invasion were 100%
and 83.3%, respectively. In ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice, by contrast, lower frequencies of
occurrence of capsular invasion (87.5%) and vascular invasion (62.5%) were detected.
Moreover, although 33% of ThrbPV/PV mice developed lung metastasis, only 25% of
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice did so. These data indicate that blocking TH synthesis delayed tumor
progression in ThrbPV/PV mice.

Inhibition of thyroid hormone production by propylthiouracil treatment decreases
proliferation of thyroid tumor cells in ThrbPV/PV mice with no apparent effect on apoptosis
Cell proliferation and apoptosis are two major processes that affect tumor growth. To
determine which process was responsible for the decreased tumor growth due to the
reduction of TH in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice, we compared the extent of cell proliferation in the
thyroids of both groups of mice by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. To
perform the assay, mice were intraperitoneally injected with BrdU 2 h before killing.
Although no apparent positive signals were detected in the thyroid sections of WT mice
(Figure 3A, panels a and b) under the experimental conditions, nuclei with BrdU
incorporation were clearly visualized by immunostaining of thyroid sections of ThrbPV/PV
mice (panels c and d) and ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice (panels e and f). However, fewer nuclei
with incorporation of BrdU were observed in the treated mice. Sections from small intestine
and brain tissue of WT mice were used as controls, representing cells with high and low
proliferation rates, respectively (Figures 3A, g and h). To quantify the percentage of cells

that were undergoing an active cell cycle within a 2-h BrdU-labeling period, we calculated
the average ratio of BrdU-positive cells to total cells from 10–12 bright fields at high
magnification (×400) of each section. The quantitative data are shown in Figure 3B. In WT
mice, less than 1% of thyrocytes underwent DNA replication (Figures 3Aa, b and B), but
more than 2.3% of cells from ThrbPV/PV mice were involved in the cell cycle (Figures 3Ac,
d and B). After PTU treatment, this ratio dropped to 1.2% (52% reduction; Figures 3Ae, f
and B), indicating a marked reduction in the proliferation of thyroid tumor cells when TH
was decreased in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice.

We also determined the effect of TH on apoptosis of thyroid tumor cells in these mice by
assessing the abundance of cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis, by
immunohistochemistry. No apparent changes of cleaved caspase 3 staining were found in
ThrbPV/PVPTU thyroid (Figure 3Cb) as compared with the control group (Figure 3Ca). We
also measured the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), a key regulator in apoptosis,
by western blot analysis (Figure 3D). Similar protein levels of Bcl-2 were found in thyroid
extracts of ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. In addition, we further determined the
protein levels of other apoptotic regulators, including B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BclxL)
and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). No apparent changes in protein levels of
these apoptotic regulators were detected in ThrbPV/PV mice with or without PTU treatment
(data not shown). Thus, consistent with cleaved caspase 3 staining, these results showed that
a reduction of TH had no effect on apoptosis of thyroid tumor cells in ThrbPV/PV mice. On
the basis of these findings, we concluded that reduced proliferation, but not apoptosis,
contributed to the reduced thyroid tumor growth of ThrbPV/PV mice when TH was lowered.
Inhibition of thyroid hormone production by propylthiouracil treatment decreases
activation of the integrin αvβ3-AKT signaling pathway in thyroids of ThrbPV/PV mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It has been reported that TH increases proliferation of human thyroid cancer cell lines by
activating the integrin αvβ3–MAPK signal transduction pathways (Lin et al., 2007). Similar
TH effects via these pathways have also been reported in human glioma cell line (Lin et al.,
2009). To dissect the molecular mechanisms of TH that led to the increased cell proliferation
in FTC of ThrbPV/PV mice, we first examined the abundance of TH membrane receptor
integrin αvβ3 at both transcriptional and translational levels. No differences in the mRNA
levels were detected for either the Itgav or the Itgb3 gene between ThrbPV/PV and
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice (Supplementary Figures IA and B). However, western blot analysis
showed that the protein level of integrin αv was lower in the thyroid tumor extract of
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice than in that of ThrbPV/PV mice (Figure 4Aa, compare lanes 3 and 4 to
lanes 1 and 2). After normalization to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) loading controls (Figure 4Ac), a 60% decrease of integrin αv protein abundance
was found in ThrbPV/PVPTU mice. However, no apparent changes in protein levels of
integrin subunit β3 were observed in ThrbPV/PVPTU mice (Figure 4Ab, compare lanes 3 and
4 with lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest a downregulation of TH membrane receptor in
response to decreased TH in thyroid tumor cells of ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice.
The PI3K-AKT signaling cascade is a critical pathway reported to be associated with the
extranuclear signaling of TH-TRs (Cao et al., 2005; Verga Falzacappa et al., 2007). Direct
association of TRβPV with the regulatory subunit p85α of PI3K activates PI3K-AKT
signaling in tumor cells of ThrbPV/PV mice (Furuya et al., 2006). Accordingly, we addressed
the question of whether TH affected the activated AKT by determining the protein
abundance of phosphorylated AKT in thyroid tumors of ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PV-PTU
mice. Figure 4B shows that AKT phosphorylation was reduced (~33%) in PTU-treated
ThrbPV/PV mice (Figure 4Ba, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1–3). In contrast to the
reduced phosphorylated AKT, no changes in the total amount of AKT protein were detected
(Figure 4Bb). We also determined the phosphorylation status of glycogen synthase kinase

3β (GSK3β), a direct downstream target of AKT. It is known that GSK3β activity is
inhibited by AKT phosphorylation, resulting in increased protein synthesis and proliferation
in cells (Liang and Slingerland, 2003). Consistent with decreased activation of AKT (Figure
4Ba), western blot analysis revealed decreased phosphorylated GSK3β (Figure 4Bc,
compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1–3) in thyroid tumors of ThrbPV/PVPTU mice without any
change in total GSK3β protein levels (Figure 4Bd). Taken together, these results show that
the lowering of TH leads to decreased AKT signaling.
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activity is increased in thyroid tumors of
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has an essential role in opposing PI3K-AKT
activation by negative regulation of the intracellular level of phosphatidylinositol- 3,4,5trisphosphate (PIP3). PTEN is also one of the tumor suppressors frequently lost in human
cancers (Keniry and Parsons, 2008). We therefore assessed the expression of the Pten gene
at both the translational and transcriptional levels. Western blot analysis revealed an
elevated PTEN protein level (~2.4- fold) in thyroid tumor extracts of ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice
(Figure 5Aa, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1–3). Using real-time RT–PCR, we
determined the Pten mRNA expression in tumors of ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PVPTU mice.
Consistent with the increased protein levels of PTEN, a small (~20%) but significantly
elevated Pten mRNA was observed in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared with ThrbPV/PV
mice (Figure 5B). These results indicate that decreased TH leads to activated expression of
the Pten gene at both the mRNA and protein levels.
Downregulation of AKT activation suppresses the activity of β-catenin to inhibit thyroid
growth in ThrbPV/PV mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aberrant activation of β-catenin by PI3K/AKT signaling pathways is a frequent event in
thyroid cancers (Abbosh and Nephew, 2005; Castellone et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of βcatenin at Ser552 by AKT increases the translocation of β-catenin to nucleus, thereby
activating its transcriptional activity to affect βcatenin downstream targets involved in cell
proliferation (Fang et al., 2007). To understand whether β-catenin is the effector of activated
AKT signaling in thyroid carcinogenesis, we compared the protein abundance of
phosphorylated β-catenin at Ser552 in thyroid tumors between ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PVPTU mice. Figure 6A shows a reduction of phospho-Ser552-β-catenin (Figure 6Aa, compare
lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1–3) in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice with no changes in total β-catenin
(Figure 6Ab). One of the downstream targets of βcatenin critical for cell proliferation is
cyclin D2 (Rowlands et al., 2004; Cole et al., 2010). To determine whether the reduced βcatenin affects the cyclin D2 protein level, we evaluated the protein abundance of cyclin D2
in thyroid tumors of ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PVPTU mice. Indeed, we found that the protein
level of cyclin D2 was lower (by ~38%) in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice than in ThrbPV/PV mice
(Figure 6Ba, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2). We also investigated the alteration
of MMP2, a downstream target of β-catenin and a key regulator during tumor invasion and
metastasis (Kessenbrock et al., 2010; Sonderegger et al., 2010), by western blot analysis.
Consistent with the suppressed activity of β-catenin, a decrease in MMP2 protein level
(~51%) was also observed in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared with that in untreated mice
(Figure 6Ca, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that reduced
β-catenin contributes to decreased tumor cell proliferation, and via MMP-2, delays the
progression of invasion and metastasis in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice.

Discussion
Extensive phenotypic characterization and detailed molecular analyses have shown that
thyroid tumor progression and altered signaling pathways in ThrbPV/PV mice mimic those

observed in human thyroid cancers (Furuya et al., 2006; Ying et al., 2006, 2008; Guigon et
al., 2008; Guigon and Cheng, 2009; Lu et al., 2010). Thus, the ThrbPV/PV mouse provides us
with an unusual opportunity to investigate the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis. In
ThrbPV/PV mice, the expression of a dominant-negative mutated TRβ (that is, PV) results in
dysregulation of the pituitary–thyroid axis with elevated TSH in the face of elevated TH
(Kaneshige et al., 2000). To understand how TH affects thyroid carcinogenesis, we treated
ThrbPV/PV mice with PTU to block the synthesis of TH. As confirmed by hormone assays,
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice exhibited suppressed serum levels of TT4 as compared with the
untreated ThrbPV/PV mice (Figure 1). However, PTU had no effect on the synthesis and
secretion of TSH given that ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice maintained a TSH level as high as that of
ThrbPV/PV mice. The similarly elevated serum levels of TSH would suggest that the thyroids
of ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PVPTU mice received a similar stimulated activity from the TSH–
TSH receptor pathway in promoting thyrocyte proliferation. The similarly elevated TSH
level led us to conclude that the differences in phenotypes of thyroid tumors found between
PTU-treated and untreated ThrbPV/PV mice were mainly conferred by the effects due to
changes in TH levels. By decreasing TH levels in ThrbPV/PV mice, we observed reduced
growth of thyroid tumors with delayed pathological progression. The reduced tumor size
was mainly attributed to the decreased tumor cell proliferation with no changes in apoptotic
status (Figures 2 and 3). Thus, TH acts to stimulate thyroid tumor cell proliferation of
ThrbPV/PV mice.

To dissect the molecular mechanisms by which TH activated tumor cell proliferation, we
focused on the studies of key regulators involved in membrane signaling events. Although
TRβ is the major TR isoform in the thyroid, we reasoned that in ThrbPV/PV mice the mutant
TRβ, PV, could no longer mediate TH actions. Moreover, we previously discovered that
TRβPV acts not only in a dominant-negative fashion by nucleusinitiated events, but also by
extranuclear signaling by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway (Furuya et al., 2006, 2007), as
well as by increasing the stability of β-catenin (Guigon et al., 2008, 2010), thereby
promoting thyroid carcinogenesis in ThrbPV/PV mice (Lu and Cheng, 2011). Accordingly,
we ascertained which players in the TRβPV-mediated extranuclear PI3K-AKT pathway
were affected by TH. Indeed, we found that the upstream negative regulator of PI3K-AKT
signaling, PTEN, was markedly increased when TH was reduced in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice
(Figure 5, also see Figure 7), leading to an attenuation of PI3K-AKT signaling (Figures 4
and 7). Consistently, the protein abundance of phosphorylated β-catenin, a critical
downstream key effector of PI3K-AKT signaling, was reduced when TH was lowered,
leading to reduced cyclin D2 to decrease cell proliferation. Thus, the present study has
uncovered an effect of TH that modulates the activity of the PTEN–PI3K–AKT–β-catenin–
cyclin D2 pathway to affect the tumor cell proliferation and carcinogenesis of the thyroid of
ThrbPV/PV mice.
At present, how TH regulates the expression of the Pten gene is not clear. In addition to an
increased protein abundance of PTEN (Figure 5A) when TH was lowered, we found a small
but significant increase in the mRNA expression of the Pten gene in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice
(Figure 5B). One possibility that could be considered to account for the increased expression
of the Pten gene protein is by the TH membrane receptor, integrin αvβ3, reported by Davis
and his group (Bergh et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2010). Actions of TH on the
integrin αvβ3 receptor have been demonstrated in many cell types with diverse cellular
effects, such as T4-simulated angiogenesis on vessel endothelial cells and enhanced
proliferation of tumor cells, including breast cancer, glioblastoma and thyroid cancer cell
lines (Davis et al., 2004; Mousa et al., 2006; Glinskii et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009). The
present study showed decreased protein abundance of integrin subunit αv, albeit with no
changes of β3 protein levels when TH was lowered in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice (Figure 4A). It
is possible that the expression of the Pten gene is affected by dampening integrin αvβ3

signaling, followed by relaying the signals via MAPK phosphorylation cascades (Bergh et
al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007) to reach the ultimate downstream nuclear events (yet to be
identified). However, this possibility awaits future studies to be tested and validated.
The data from the present molecular study led us to propose a model (see Figure 7) that
supports the contention that one mechanism by which TH acted was by integrin-mediated
extranuclear signaling. TRβ is the major TR isoform in the thyroid, and is mutated to PV
that cannot bind TH in ThrbPV/PV mice. However, at present, we could not exclude the
possibility that TH could potentially mediate its proliferative effects by TRα1-initiated
nuclear genomic signaling events. However, PV is known to be a potent dominant-negative
mutant (Parrilla et al., 1991; Kaneshige et al., 2000). The possibility exists that it could also
act to interfere with the transcription activity of TRα1. However, at present, no data are
available to clarify the role of TRα1 in mediating TH effects in the thyroid of ThrbPV/PV
mice.

Association studies have shown that amplification of the PIK3CA gene and aberrant
activation of AKT are frequent in human thyroid cancer (Hou et al., 2007; Saji and Ringel,
2010; Xing, 2010), demonstrating the crucial role of PI3K-AKT signaling in thyroid
carcinogenesis. Recently, using a mouse model of FTC in which two alleles of the Pten gene
were selectively deleted in the thyroid, Antico-Arciuch et al. (2010) showed a direct role of
estrogens in increasing thyrocyte proliferative index by crosstalk with the PI3K pathway.
The present study identified TH as a critical hormonal stimulator to promote thyroid
carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice by regulating the PI3K-AKT signaling. The present data
have shown that TH acts to promote tumor cell proliferation by PI3K–AKT–β-catenin–
cyclin D2 signaling. In view of these findings, anti-thyroid drugs could be considered as
potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of thyroid cancer.

All aspects of animal care and experimentation were approved by the National Cancer
Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. ThrbPV/PV mice used in the present study were
the offspring of many generations of intersibling mating over 6 years (more than 30
generations). For the PTU treatment group, ThrbPV/PV mice were fed an iodine-deficient
diet supplemented with 0.15% PTU (cat. no.; TD.95125, Harlan Laboratories, Inc.,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) beginning at the age of 2 months and continuing on the PTU diet
until the mice were killed for analyses. Control group mice were fed a normal mouse diet.
Moribund mutant mice and PTU-treated littermates were euthanized to harvest tissues for
weighing, histological analysis and biochemical studies.
Determination of serum levels of total T4 and thyroidstimulating hormone by
radioimmunoassay
Blood was collected from the mice before killing. The serum level of TT4 was determined
by using a Gamma Coat T4 assay radioimmunoassay kit (Dia-Sorin, Stillwater, MN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TSH levels in serum were measured as
previously described (Kaneshige et al., 2000).
Histology and immunohistochemistry
For histological evaluation, thyroid glands were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and
subsequently embedded in paraffin. Five-μm-thick sections were prepared and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was also
performed with paraffin sections by standard methods. In brief, de-waxed sections were

the antigen epitopes. The primary antibody, rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody (1:50
dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), was incubated with tissues
overnight at 4 °C. Peroxidase activity from the secondary antibody was detected by adding
substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay
To measure the thyrocyte proliferation rate, the BrdU incorporation assay was performed. In
brief, mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU at 50 μg/g of body weight and then
killed 2 h after the injection. Tissues were processed and immunohistochemistry was
performed on paraffin sections as described above with some modifications. Briefly,
dewaxed slides were treated with Antigen Unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) in the microwave for 20 min after boiling, and stained with mouse
anti- BrdU antibody (1:10 dilution, Cat. no.; 347589, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry
Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. The quantification of BrdU-positive cells
was performed on digital images captured under ×400 magnification of each thyroid section.
Two randomly selected slides from three thyroids of each group were analyzed. For each
slide, ratios of BrdU-positive cells/total cells from 10–12 bright fields under ×400
amplification were calculated.

Western blot analysis
Protein extracts from thyroids dissected from ThrbPV/PV and ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice were
prepared as described previously (Lu et al., 2010). About 30–40 μg of protein extract was
analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the western
blot analysis was carried out (Furumoto et al., 2005). Primary antibodies for phosphorylatedSer473-AKT, total AKT, p-Ser21/9-GSK-3α/β, total GSK-3β, p-Ser552-βcatenin, pSer33/37/Thr41-β-catenin, total β-catenin, cleaved caspase 3, cyclin D2 and GAPDH were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for integrin αv, integrin β3 and
MMP-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Quantitative real-time RT–PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total RNA from five to seven mouse thyroids in each experimental group was extracted by
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by RNase-free DNase treatment (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and column purification (RNeasyMini Kit, Qiagen). For real-time
reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR), one-step RT–PCR reactions were performed with 50
ng of total RNA using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT–PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Roche
LightCycler PCR instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) with specific primers as
follows: mItgav-F2773: 5′-CTG CACGGCAGATACAGAGATC-3′; mItgav-R2935: 5′GCAC TTGGCGATTCCACAGC-3′; mItgb3-F582: 5′-CAAGCCTG
TATCGCCGTACATG-3′; mItgb3-R760: 5′-CATCTCGATT ACGGGACACGCTC-3′;
mPten-F1-1427: 5′-GATTACAGA CCCGTGGCACT-3′; mPten-R1-1606: 5′TGGCTGAGGGA ACTCAAAGT-3′; mGapdh-F2-436: 5′-TTGTGATGGGTG
TGAACCAC-3′; m-Gapdh-R2-674: 5′-GGATGCAGGGAT GATGTTCT-3′. The reaction
conditions were 50 °C for 20 min; 95 °C for 15 min; 40–45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C
for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s; and 65–95 °C with a heating rate of 0.1 °C/s and a cooling step
to 40 °C.
Statistical analysis
All data of radioimmunoassays were expressed as mean± s.e.m. The statistical analyses on
these data were performed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni’s
post hoc test for multiple comparisons (Prism, GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). P<0.05

was considered as statistically significant. For western blot results, films were scanned and
the intensity of each band was quantified by ImageJ Analysis Software (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA). Data were normalized against GAPDH or calculated as a ratio between
phosphorylated and total protein levels. For real-time RT–PCR, the Gapdh gene expression
was used as an internal control. The statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired ttest by Prism software (GraphPad). P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Ablation of TH by PTU decreases activation of the integrin αvβ3–AKT signaling pathway
in thyroids of ThrbPV/PV mice. Total thyroid lysates from six to seven mice of each group
were analyzed by western blot analysis as described in Materials and methods. The average
ratios of band intensity after normalization were shown under the image. The expression
levels of integrins were normalized to the protein amount of loading control, GAPDH.
Compared with ThrbPV/PV mice (Aa, lanes 1 and 2), a decrease of integrin αv was observed
in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice (lanes 3 and 4), whereas no apparent changes of integrin β3 (Ab)
were found. The relative abundance of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) or p-GSK3β was
normalized to the total protein amount. Reduced p-AKT (Ba, lanes 4 and 5) and p-GSK3β
(Bc, lanes 4 and 5) were observed in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared with ThrbPV/PV
mice (lanes 1–3 of Ba and Bc, respectively). No apparent alterations in total protein levels of

an approximately 2.4-fold increase of PTEN protein level was observed in ThrbPV/PV-PTU
mice (Aa, lanes 4 and 5) than that in ThrbPV/PV mice (Aa, lanes 1–3). (B) The mRNA
expression level of the Pten gene was measured by real-time RT–PCR. Reactions were
performed in 50 ng of total RNA from five mouse thyroid samples from each group. Gapdh
gene expression was used as a reference. A higher level of Pten mRNA was detected in

A proposed model illustrating the effects of reduced TH in thyroid cancer development in
ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. In ThrbPV/PV thyroid tumor cells, TRβPV directly interacts with
PI3K to activate AKT signaling pathway (Furuya et al., 2006). By suppression of TH in
these cells, the membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 was downregulated. In addition, the PTEN
activity was activated, which decreased the formation of PIP3. The reduction of PIP3
decreased the p-AKT and its downstream β-catenin and GSK3β signaling cascades to inhibit
cell proliferation. The solid arrows indicate the direction of signaling cascade. The broken
arrows mark the up and down changes.
