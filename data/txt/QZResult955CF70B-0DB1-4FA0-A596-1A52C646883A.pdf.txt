ABSTRACT
Aberrant Hedgehog (Hh)/glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) signaling has
been implicated in cancer progression. Here, we analyzed GLI1, Sonic Hedgehog
(Shh) and NF-κB expression in 51 breast cancer (ductal carcinoma) tissues using
immunohistochemistry. We found a positive correlation between nuclear GLI1
expression and tumor grade in ductal carcinoma cases. Cytoplasmic Shh staining
significantly correlated with a lower tumor grade. Next, the in vitro effects of two
Hh signaling pathway inhibitors on breast cancer cell lines were evaluated using the
Smoothened (SMO) antagonist GDC-0449 and the direct GLI1 inhibitor GANT-61.
GDC-0449 and GANT-61 exhibited the following effects: a) inhibited breast cancer
cell survival; b) induced apoptosis; c) inhibited Hh pathway activity by decreasing
the mRNA expression levels of GLI1 and Ptch and inhibiting the nuclear translocation
of GLI1; d) increased/decreased EGFR and ErbB2 protein expression, reduced p21Ras and ERK1/ERK2 MAPK activities and inhibited AKT activation; and e) decreased
the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. However, GANT-61 exerted these effects more
effectively than GDC-0449. The in vivo antitumor activities of GDC-0449 and GANT61 were analyzed in BALB/c mice that were subcutaneously inoculated with mouse
breast cancer (TUBO) cells. GDC-0449 and GANT-61 suppressed tumor growth of
TUBO cells in BALB/c mice to different extents. These findings suggest that targeting
the Hh pathway using antagonists that act downstream of SMO is a more efficient
strategy than using antagonists that act upstream of SMO for interrupting Hh signaling
in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

have been identified in vertebrates: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh),
Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) [2, 3].
Hh ligands initiate “canonical” Hh signaling by
binding to a 12-span transmembrane protein receptor
termed Patched-1 (Ptch), which is located at the base of a
non-motile structure that protrudes from the cell surface,

The Hedgehog (Hh)/glioma-associated oncogene
(GLI) pathway is a complex signaling cascade that
performs crucial functions in vertebrate embryogenesis
and adult tissue homeostasis [1]. Three Hh homologs

known as the “primary cilium” [3, 4].
In the absence of an Hh ligand, Ptch represses signal
transduction by inhibiting the 7-span transmembrane
protein Smoothened (SMO) from entering the cilium.
Upon ligand binding, SMO enters the cilium and
transduces the Hh signal, activating the cytoplasmic GLI
family of zinc-finger transcription factors and promoting
their translocation to the nucleus. Three GLI proteins
are involved in vertebrate Hh signaling; GLI1 and GLI2
stimulate but GLI3 antagonizes the function of ShhGLI1/2 [3, 4].
GLI activation induces the transcription of Hh
target gene products, including ubiquitous genes such as
GLI1, Ptch1 and Hh-interacting protein (Hhip) and cell
type-specific genes such as Cyclin D, Myc, Bmi1, Bcl-2,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietins
and SNAIL, depending on the cell type [3, 5]. In addition,
Hh signaling down-regulates E-cadherin [3, 5].
GLI protein activation is controlled at different
levels via phosphorylation or acetylation by inhibitors
such as Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), REN/KCTD11/
KCASH1, protein kinase A (PKA), and glycogen synthase
kinase 3b (GSK3b) and activators such as Dyrk1, Ras and
AKT [6-10].
Aberrant Hh signaling, which can be achieved
by mutational inactivation of Ptch, aberrant expression
of its ligand, constitutive activation of SMO or gene
amplification of GLI-associated transcription factors,
has been implicated in the initiation and/or maintenance
of different cancer types, including basal cell carcinoma
(BCC), gastrointestinal, lung, and brain tumors and
rhabdomyosarcoma [3]. In addition, dysregulation of
Hh signaling can be involved in the development and
progression of breast cancer [11]. Mutations in Hh pathway
genes have been identified at a low frequency in breast
cancer cases, although no function of these mutations in
breast cancer has been shown [12-15]. Conversely, several
studies reported the overexpression of an Hh ligand, often
Shh, and the Hh transcriptional targets GLI1 and Ptch1,
thus activating the Hh pathway, in breast cancer [11,
16-19]. Shh expression was up-regulated in early-stage
breast carcinoma, suggesting that the up-regulation of
Shh may be an early event in breast carcinogenesis [19].
Furthermore, the positive correlation of NF-κB expression
with Shh up-regulation suggests that NF-κB controls Shh
expression in breast cancer [19]. Indeed, accumulating
evidence has indicated that the Hh/GLI signaling cascade
contributes to malignant transformation via cross-talk with
ErbB receptors and NF-κB [4, 20, 21].
Targeting the Hh pathway could be a promising
therapy for several types of tumors. More than 50
compounds have been identified to inhibit Hh signaling
in cancer [22]. In particular, GDC-0449 (Vismodegib/
ErivedgeTM), an SMO antagonist, has entered clinical
trials and was approved in January 2012 by the FDA for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic
BCC who cannot be treated with surgery or radiation [23,
24]. Another promising therapeutic agent is GANT-61,
which directly binds to the transcription factor GLI [25].
The efficacy of blocking the Hh pathway using GANT-61
is under investigation in many preclinical studies [25].
In this study, we assessed the expression levels
of GLI1, Shh and NF-κB in 51 ductal breast carcinoma
specimens by immunohistochemical analysis and
their correlations with clinico-pathological variables.
Furthermore, we explored the in vitro effects of GDC0449 and GANT-61 on cell proliferation, cell cycle
regulation and Hh, ErbB receptors and pro-survival
signaling pathways in human (MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-453, MDA-MB-468, T47-D, MCF-7, BT-474, and
SK-BR-3) and mouse (TUBO) breast cancer cell lines.
In addition, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor activities
of these two inhibitors in BALB/c mice that were
transplanted with TUBO cells. Our results demonstrate
the aberrant expression of Hh signaling pathway members
in breast carcinoma and the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer
activities of two Hh pathway inhibitors.

RESULTS
GLI1, Shh and NF-κB expression in human breast
carcinoma specimens
To assess the expression of GLI1, Shh and NF-κB
in breast cancer tissues, immunohistochemical analysis
was performed using specific antibodies. Staining for
GLI1, Shh and NF-κB was analyzed by employing a
tissue microarray composed of 51 ductal breast carcinoma
specimens (G1: n = 10; G2: n = 31; and G3: n = 10).
The expression of GLI1, Shh and NF-κB correlated with
clinico-pathological variables including histological type,
tumor grade, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and
EGFR, ErbB2, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PR) expression (Table 1).
Nuclear expression of GLI1 was observed
in 33/51 (65%) carcinoma samples, including 3/10
(30%), 23/31 (74%) and 7/10 (70%) G1, G2 and G3
tumors, respectively. The nuclear GLI1 staining was
heterogeneous, ranging from 10% to 80% of all cells,
with a mean percentage of 41%. The number of carcinoma
specimens and the percentage of tumor cells displaying
nuclear GLI1 expression were significantly associated
with the tumor grade (Table 1). Nuclear GLI1 expression
was observed in 26/43 (60%) ErbB2-negative tumor
samples and 7/8 (88%) ErbB2-positive tumor samples, and
the mean percentage of cells with nuclear GLI1 staining
was 37 and 55%, respectively. The percentage of cells
displaying nuclear GLI1 staining positively correlated

with ErbB2 positivity (p = 0.027) in the carcinoma
samples. However, nuclear GLI1 staining did not correlate
with the expression of the other analyzed receptors, and
no correlation was found between GLI1 expression and
lymph node involvement or tumor size.
Cytoplasmic Shh expression was observed in 30/51
(59%) carcinoma samples (4/10 (40%) of G1, 19/31
(61%) of G2 and 7/10 (70%) of G3 samples). The mean
percentage of cells displaying cytoplasmic Shh staining
was 97%. The percentage cells displaying cytoplasmic
Shh staining correlated with the tumor grade. In addition,
we observed cytoplasmic Shh expression in 25/43 (58%)
ErbB2-negative and 5/8 (63%) ErbB2-positive tumors, in
13/23 (57%) PR-negative and 17/28 (61%) PR-positive
tumors and in 8/16 (50%) ER-negative and 22/35 (63%)
ER-positive tumors. However, no correlation between
cytoplasmic Shh staining and expression of these receptors
was found.
Notably, nuclear Shh staining was found in 5/51
(10%) carcinoma samples. However, no correlation
between nuclear Shh staining and any clinico-pathological
variable was detected.
NF-κB expression was observed in 20/51 (39%)

carcinoma specimens (4/10 (40%) for G1; 15/31 (48%)
G2; and 1/10 (10%) G3 samples). In addition, we found
NF-κB expression in 17/43 (40%) ErbB2-negative and
3/8 (38%) ErbB2-positive tumors; in 9/23 (39%) PRnegative and 11/28 (39%) PR-positive tumors; and in
5/16 (31%) ER-negative and 15/35 (43%) ER-positive
tumors. NF-κB expression in the carcinoma specimens
positively correlated with smaller tumor size (p = 0.034).
Representative immunostaining results are shown in
Figure 1.

Inhibition of breast cancer cell survival by GDC0449 and GANT-61
The aberrant expression of Hh signaling pathway
members in breast carcinoma samples prompted us to
evaluate the in vitro effects of two Hh signaling pathway
inhibitors on breast cancer cell lines. GDC-0449 is an
SMO antagonist, and GANT-61 directly inhibits GLI.
The survival of human (MCF-7, T47-D, MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, BT-474, and
SK-BR-3) and mouse (TUBO) breast cancer cell lines
was evaluated by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay after

exposing the cells to increasing doses of GDC-0449 (312 µM) or the vehicle control (DMSO) for 48, 72, 96
hours or 6 days. The same assay was performed after
exposing the cells to increasing doses of GANT-61 (1-20
µM) or the vehicle control (DMSO) for 48 and 72 hours.
Experiments were also performed using TUBO cells to
establish whether this mouse cell line was susceptible

to the in vitro antitumor activity of these inhibitors and
would thus be suitable for transplantation into BALB/c to
generate tumors for the purpose of determining the in vivo
antitumor effects of these two inhibitors.
GDC-0449 decreased cell survival in all cell lines,
although only at the highest dose (12 µM) and after 72
and 96 hours or 6 days of treatment. This effect was

(MCF-7, T47-D, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, BT-474, and SK-BR-3) and mouse (TUBO) breast cancer cell lines and
of human MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells were assessed by the SRB assay after 48, 72, 96 hours or 6 days of treatment with DMSO or
GDC-0449 (Panel A.) or after 48 and 72 hours of treatment with DMSO or GANT-61 (Panel B.). The percentage of surviving cells treated
with a compound or the vehicle control was calculated by normalizing the O.D. value to that of the untreated control cultures. The results
are expressed as the means±SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (˟p ≤ 0.05, *p ≤ 0.01, #p ≤ 0.001 compared with
the cultures treated with DMSO).

particularly evident in MCF-7, T47-D, SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells, in which GDC-0449 significantly reduced cell
survival at 12 µM after 48 hours. In addition, GDC-0449
reduced MCF-7 and T47-D cell survival at 6 µM and SKBR-3 cell survival at 6 and 3 µM after 6 days of treatment.
The mean results of three independent experiments are
reported in Figure 2, panel A.
The effect of GANT-61 on cell proliferation was
dose- and time-dependent and was significant compared
with the vehicle control at doses from 5 to 20 µM in 7 out
of the 8 examined cell lines after 48 hours and in all cell
lines after 72 hours of treatment. GANT-61 significantly
reduced cell survival at all doses tested after 72 hours only
in MDA-MB-468 cells. GANT-61 significantly decreased
cell survival in SK-BR-3 cells (after 48 and 72 hours) and
T47-D cells (after 72 hours) when applied at the 2.5 µM

dose. The mean results of three independent experiments
are reported in Figure 2, panel B.
To evaluate the non-specific toxic effects of these
drugs, the survival of human MCF-10A mammary
epithelial cells, which are a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell
line derived from mammary glands, was evaluated upon
treatment with each compound (Figure 2, panel A and B).
Notably, GDC-0449 did not alter MCF-10A cell survival.
In addition, GANT-61 significantly reduced MCF-10A
cell survival only at the highest doses (20 and 15 µM),
suggesting an in vitro toxic effect of this compound when
applied at these high doses. No effects of GANT-61 on
MCF-10A cells were observed at lower doses.
Overall, our results demonstrated that GANT-61 is
more effective than GDC-0449 in reducing the survival of
breast cancer cells.

TUBO) or 6 days with DMSO or GDC-0449 (Panel A) or for 48 hours with DMSO or GANT-61 (Panel B). The results are expressed as
the means±SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (˟p ≤ 0.05, *p ≤ 0.01, #p ≤ 0.001 compared with the cultures treated
with DMSO).

Effect of GDC-0449 and GANT-61 on cell cycle

cell lines. Pooling the data from these 8 cell lines, the
percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase ranged from 2.00
to 8.98% in cultures treated with DMSO; from 6.31 to
23.91% in cultures treated with 5 µM GANT-61; from
24.28 to 84.12% in cultures treated with 10 µM GANT-61;
and from 67.37 to 96.59% in cultures treated with 20 µM
GANT-61 (Figure 3, Panel B). The increase in the sub-G1
fraction was associated with dose-dependent decreases
in the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S or G2/M phases.
The mean results of three independent experiments are
reported in Supplementary Table 2.
In agreement with our above results, GANT-61
treatment appears to be more effective than GDC-0449 in
increasing the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase in all
cell lines. Indeed, GANT-61 was effective after 48 hours,
but GDC-0449 was effective only in 4 cell lines after 6
days of treatment.

To evaluate the effect of GDC-0449 and GANT-61
on cell cycle distribution, FACS analysis of DNA content
was performed on 8 breast cancer cell lines treated with
increasing doses of GDC-0449 (3 to 25 µM) for 96 hours
or 6 days or GANT-61 (5 to 20 µM) for 48 hours. DMSO
was used as the vehicle.
GDC-0449 treatment at the highest dose increased
the percentage of MDA-MB-468 and T47-D cells in the
sub-G1 phase and exerted the same effect on MCF-7 cells
at 25-12 µM and on SK-BR-3 cells at all doses tested
(Figure 3, Panel A). The increase in the percentage of
cells in sub-G1 phase was associated with a decrease in
the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase in MDA-MB-468,
T47-D, and SK-BR-3 cells and with a reduction in the
percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases in MCF-7 cells.
The mean results of three independent experiments are
reported in Supplementary Table 1.

increased the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase in all

expression statuses) [26-31] (Supplementary Table 3).
PARP-1, an enzyme that controls DNA repair, cell
cycle progression and cell death, is cleaved by caspases
during the apoptotic process. This cleavage can be
detected by Western blotting using a specific antibody that
recognizes both the full-length and C-terminally cleaved
forms of PARP-1.
In GDC-0449-treated cells, although no increase
in PARP-1 cleavage was observed, decreased PARP-1
expression was detected in SK-BR-3 cells (p = 0.02). In
addition, the amount of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and
the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were increased following GDC-0449
treatment compared with DMSO treatment in all cell lines.
Bcl-2 expression was not detected in T47-D and SK-BR-3
cells. The increased Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio in MCF-7
cells and the increased Bax expression level in T47-D and
SK-BR-3 cells might shift the cellular balance toward a
pro-apoptotic state (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4).
Treatment with GANT-61 induced PARP-1 cleavage

To corroborate that the GDC-0449- and GANT61-induced increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G1
phase was partially caused by the induction of apoptosis,
PARP-1 cleavage and the Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio were
analyzed by Western blotting.
T47-D, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells
were treated with 12 µM GDC-0449 or DMSO for 6 days.
Alternatively, T47-D, MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453 and BT-474 breast cancer
cells were treated with 10 µM GANT-61 or DMSO for 48
hours. After incubation, the cells were lysed, resolved in
10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
and incubated with specific antibodies. The results varied
according to the cell line examined, likely because
different breast cancer cell lines have distinct phenotypes
and genetic backgrounds (ER, PR, ErbB2, p53 and Ras

other cell lines. However, decreased PARP-1 expression in
MCF-7 cells was observed after treatment with GANT-61
(p = 0.03). GANT-61 treatment increased the expression of
the pro-apoptotic factor Bax and decreased the expression
of Bcl-2 in MCF-7 (p = 0.03), T47-D (p < 0.001) and
MDA-MB-453 (p = 0.006) cells. These events can shift
the cellular balance towards a pro-apoptotic state. The
expression of these apoptotic regulatory proteins was not
significantly altered by GANT-61 treatment in the other
cell lines (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4).
Next, to determine whether GDC-0449- or GANT61-induced apoptosis requires p53, the expression of p53
was analyzed. p53 expression was significantly increased
in GDC-0449-treated MCF-7 (p = 0.02) and T47-D (p =
0.04) cells, but remained unchanged in SK-BR-3 cells
(Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4).
GANT-61 treatment increased p53 expression in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002,
respectively); decreased p53 expression in T47-D (p =
0.02), SK-BR-3 (p = 0.01) and MDA-MB-453 (p = 0.04)
cells; and did not change p53 expression in the remaining
cell lines (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4).

GDC-0449 treatment was detected compared with the
control treatment. Conversely, after GANT-61 treatment,
a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the Ptch mRNA
levels in 5 of the 8 examined cell lines (T47-D, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468)
was observed. The Ptch mRNA levels were not detectable
in SK-BR-3 cells (Figure 5, panel A). Accordingly, our
results suggest that GANT-61 inhibits the Hh pathway
more potently than GDC-0449. The distinct activities of
GANT-61 and GDC-0449 on the GLI1 and Ptch mRNA
levels in different cell lines might be due to variations in
the basal activity of their promoters in these cells. Some
of these cells possess different activated Hh components.
GLI1 activation promotes its translocation to the nucleus
to initiate the transcription of Hh target genes. To further
corroborate the inhibitory effects of GANT-61 on the Hh
pathway, immunofluorescence analysis was performed
to detect GLI1 expression in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells
that were treated with 10 µM GANT-61 or DMSO for 24
hours. GANT-61 inhibited the translocation of GLI1 to
the nucleus. Decreased nuclear expression of GLI1 was
observed in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells after GANT-61
treatment compared with the control treatment (Figure 5,
panel B).
The GLI2 mRNA levels were very low and
were unchanged in most the cell lines upon treatment
with GDC-0449 or GANT-61. In addition, GLI2overexpressing cell lines, except MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3, did not show a significant change in GLI2 mRNA
levels following treatment. MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3 cells exhibited a significant reduction in the GLI2
mRNA levels only at the lowest dose of GDC-0449, thus
indicating the presence of a compensatory mechanism that
induces GLI2 transcription following strong inhibition of
GLI target gene products (Supplementary Figure 1).

Effects of GDC-0449 and GANT-61 on the GLI1,
GLI2 and Ptch mRNA levels and the nuclear
translocation of GLI1
To evaluate the effect of treatment with GDC-0449
or GANT-61 on the activity of the Hh pathway, real-time
q-PCR was performed on RNA that was isolated from
breast cancer cells treated with GDC-0449 (12-25 µM for
24 hours and 50 µM for 48 hours), GANT-61 (20 µM for
48 hours) or DMSO. After RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis
was performed, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis of the GLI1, GLI2 and Ptch mRNA
expression levels was performed after normalization to
the controls. The GLI1 and Ptch mRNA levels before and
after cell treatment are reported in Figure 5, panel A.
Our results indicated that the GLI1 mRNA levels
were greatly decreased after GDC-0449 treatment only in
SK-BR-3 cells at 12-25 µM (p < 0.05); at 50 µM, GLI1
mRNA was not detectable. In T47-D and TUBO cells,
the GLI1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased (p
< 0.05) only at the highest dose of GDC-0449 (50 µM).
No reduction in the GLI1 mRNA levels after GDC-0449
treatment was observed in the other cell lines. Conversely,
GANT-61 treatment significantly decreased the GLI1
mRNA levels (p < 0.05) in SK-BR-3, T47-D, MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231 and TUBO cells. In MDA-MB-468 cells,
the GLI1 mRNA levels were not detectable even when
lower doses of GANT-61 were applied.
The Ptch mRNA levels were slightly but
significantly decreased after GDC-0449 treatment only
in T47-D cells at high doses (25-50 µM). In the other
cell lines, no reduction in the Ptch mRNA levels after

Effects of GDC-0449 and GANT-61 on the
expression and activation of ErbB receptors and
pro-survival signaling pathway members
ErbB receptors are members of one of the primary
signal transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell
growth [32]. In addition, accumulating evidence has
indicated that cross-talk between ErbB receptors and
the Hh/GLI signaling pathway is involved in neoplastic
transformation [20].
To evaluate whether GDC-0449 or GANT-61 alters
EGFR/ErbB2 expression and ERK1/2 expression and
activation, Western blotting analysis was performed after
treating cells with GDC-0449 (12 µM) or DMSO for 6
days or with GANT-61 (10 µM) or DMSO for 48 h. The
results varied according to the cell line used.
GDC-0449 reduced EGFR expression in T47-D cells
(p = 0.03) but did not change EGFR expression in MCF7 and SK-BR-3 cells. GDC-0449 had no notable effect
9259

on the ErbB2 protein levels (Figure 6 and Supplementary
Table 4).
In addition, GANT-61 slightly reduced EGFR
expression in T47-D (p = 0.02), SK-BR-3 (p = 0.04)
and MDA-MB-231 (p = 0.01) cells but increased EGFR
expression in MCF-7 (p = 0.02), BT-474 (p = 0.004) and
MDA-MB-468 (p = 0.006) cells. EGFR expression was
not detectable after GANT-61 treatment in MDA-MB-453
cells, and this result suggested that this treatment reduced
EGFR expression. GANT-61 decreased ErbB2 expression
in T47-D (p = 0.008) and MDA-MB-453 (p = 0.005) cells
but did not change its expression in MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and
BT-474 cells; ErbB2 expression was not detectable in the
other cell lines (Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 4).
We also investigated the effect of GDC-0449 or
GANT-61 on the expression and phosphorylation of
ERK1/ERK2 (ERK1/2), which are activated by ErbB
receptors. The levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2
proteins were compared with the total ERK protein level.
GDC-0449 did not alter the basal or phosphorylated
ERK (p-ERK)1/2 protein expression levels in T47-D and
SK-BR-3 cells, but GDC-0449 reduced the p-ERK1/2
levels in MCF-7 cells (p = 0.007 for p-ERK1; p = 0.03
for p-ERK2) (Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 4). The
total ERK1/2 levels remained the same after GANT-61

treatment in all cell lines. GANT-61 significantly inhibited
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 (p = 0.049 for
p-ERK1; p = 0.002 for p-ERK2), MDA-MB-468 (p = 0.04
for p-ERK1; p = 0.003 for p-ERK2) and MDA-MB-453 (p
= 0.04 for p-ERK1; p = 0.009 for p-ERK2) cells (Figure 6
and Supplementary Table 4).
Ras is also activated by ErbB receptors [33]. Thus,
we analyzed the effect of GANT-61 on Ras expression in
breast cancer cell lines using an antibody that detects an
epitope that is common to both activated and deactivated
H-, K- and N-Ras p21. GANT-61 significantly inhibited
p21-Ras expression in T47-D (p = 0.026), MCF-7 (p =
0.008), MDA-MB-231 (p = 0.006), BT-474 (p = 0.017),
and MDA-MB-453 (p = 0.002) cells.
Furthermore, we evaluated whether GANT-61
treatment inhibits the protein expression of the pro-survival
kinase AKT, which promotes tumor growth. GANT-61
significantly decreased the activated phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT) protein levels compared with the control
in MDA-MB-231 (p = 0.004), MDA-MB-468 (p = 0.03)
and BT-474 (p = 0.03) cells. p-AKT expression was not
detectable in MCF-7 or MDA-MB-453 cells. GANT-61
treatment significantly increased the p-AKT/AKT ratio in
SK-BR-3 cells compared with the control treatment (p =
0.02) (Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 4).

mice per group) were subcutaneously inoculated with
1x106 TUBO cells in the right flank. These mice were
simultaneously treated per os with GDC-0449 or GANT61 dissolved in corn oil:ethanol (4:1) or with the vehicle
alone.
After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice treated with
GDC-0449 or GANT-61 showed a significant decrease in
the mean tumor volume compared with the control mice
(513 compared with 1070 mm3, p = 0.0084 for GDC-0449;
142 compared with 1070 mm3, p = 0.0049 for GANT-61)
(Figure 8, panel C). GDC-0449 increased the survival of
BALB/c mice by one week compared with the control
mice (p = 0.0009). After 4 weeks of treatment, the control
mice were sacrificed because of the excessive size of their
tumors. The GDC-0449-treated mice were sacrificed after
5 weeks of treatment (Figure 8, panel D). Conversely,
GANT-61 administration counteracted TUBO cell growth
in BALB/c mice. The mean tumor volume in GANT-61treated mice was 238 mm3 two weeks after injection. In
fact, 1 and 2 mice became tumor-free after 4 and 5 weeks
of treatment, respectively (Figure 8, panel C). Overall,
complete tumor regression was observed in 4/5 GANT61-treated mice after 6 weeks of treatment (p = 0.0005 for
GANT-61 compared with vehicle; p = 0.023 for GANT-61
compared with GDC-0449). These mice remained tumorfree for up to 30 weeks. Only 1 GANT-61-treated mouse
died at 5 weeks after injection, although its tumor volume
was small (500 mm3) (Figure 8, panel D).
Overall, our results indicated specific interference
with TUBO tumor cell growth by Hh inhibitors, and the
effect varied according to the compound. Regarding the
survival of BALB/c mice upon treatment, the risk of
TUBO tumor cell growth in the corn oil-treated group was
0.016 and 49.40 relative to the GDC-0449- and GANT-61treated groups, respectively. In addition, the risk of TUBO
tumor cell growth in the GDC-0449-treated group was
17.81 relative to the GANT-61-treated group (Table 2).

Several studies suggest an interplay between
the Hh and NF-κB signaling pathways in cancer cells.
NF-κB activation induces its translocation from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus. To evaluate whether GANT-61
treatment interferes with NF-κB nuclear translocation,
immunofluorescence analysis was performed using
MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells treated with 10 µM GANT61 or DMSO for 24 h. GANT-61 treatment reduced the
translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus of MCF-7 and SKBR-3 cells compared to the control treatment (Figure 7).

Effect of GANT-61 on ErbB2/neu and the prosurvival signaling protein AKT in murine TUBO
cells
To evaluate the effect of GANT-61 on ErbB2/
neu and on the AKT protein in BALB-neuT mammary
cancer cells (TUBO) overexpressing activated rat ErbB2/
neu, the cells were treated with 10 µM GANT-61 for 48
h, followed by Western blotting analysis. Although an
increase in EGFR expression was observed in GANT61-treated cells relative to the control-treated cells (p =
0.04), GANT-61 actually decreased the p-ERK1-2/ERK
ratio. Indeed, after GANT-61 treatment, ERK1 and ERK2
activation was abolished. However, no effect of GANT-61
on neu expression was observed (Figure 8, panel A). In
addition, GANT-61 treatment decreased the p-AKT/AKT
expression ratio compared with the control treatment (p =
0.01) (Figure 8, panel B).
Thus, our results suggest that GANT-61 exerts
antitumor effects on TUBO cells by inhibiting the MAPK
and AKT pathways.

DISCUSSION
Aberrant Hh signaling has been implicated in the
initiation and/or maintenance of different cancer types,
including breast cancer [34]. Hh-induced carcinogenesis
via constitutive Hh signaling activation is caused either

by the mutation of Hh pathway components (ligandindependent) or by Hh overexpression (ligand-dependent).
Mutations of Hh pathway genes have been identified at
a low frequency in breast cancer, and no function of
these mutations in breast cancer has been shown [12-15].
Alternatively, several studies reported overexpression
of Hh ligands, often Shh, and of the Hh transcriptional
targets GLI1 and Ptch1 and, thus, the activation of the Hh
pathway in breast cancer [11, 16, 17].
Accordingly, we assessed the expression of Hh
pathway members (GLI1, Shh and NF-κB) in 51 ductal
breast carcinoma specimens by immunohistochemical
analysis, and we correlated their expression with clinicopathological variables. The number of carcinoma
specimens and the percentage of tumor cells displaying
nuclear GLI1 expression were significantly associated
with the tumor grade. Additionally, the percentage of
cytoplasmic Shh staining correlated with the tumor grade.
These results are consistent with those of other studies
that evaluated the clinico-pathological significance
of Hh signaling in breast tumors. Cui et al. suggested
that Shh up-regulation may be an early event in breast
carcinogenesis because Shh expression was elevated in
early-stage breast carcinoma [19]. In addition, increases
in Hh ligand expression and Hh pathway activation have
been reported over the progression of malignant breast
epithelial lesions from non-neoplastic masses to ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC) [17, 35]. Furthermore, we evaluated the cytoplasmic
expression of NF-κB and found a positive correlation
between the number of NF-κB-positive carcinoma
specimens and smaller tumor size. Nakashima et al.
reported that NF-κB can directly induce Shh expression
in vitro and in vivo and can promote pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance via the Shh
pathway [21, 36]. Interestingly, the percentage of cells
displaying nuclear GLI1 staining positively correlated
with ErbB2 expression in carcinoma samples (p = 0.027),
and this result suggests the involvement of Hh pathway
activation in the development of ErbB2-positive breast
cancer. Thus, the Hh signaling pathway may be a potential
therapeutic target for these types of breast cancer. In
fact, Hh signaling can be blocked at many levels using a
variety of small molecules that target different members
of this pathway. More than 50 compounds have been
identified as inhibitors of Hh signaling in cancer [22].
In particular, GDC-0449 (Vismodegib/ErivedgeTM), an
SMO antagonist, entered clinical trials and was approved
in January 2012 by the FDA for the treatment of adults
with locally advanced or metastatic BCC who cannot be
treated with surgery or radiation [37]. Another promising
therapeutic agent is GANT-61, which directly inhibits the
transcription factor GLI, and the efficacy of GANT-61 in
blocking the Hh pathway is under investigation in many
preclinical studies [38-40].
In light of these findings, we evaluated the in vitro
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

anti-cancer activities of GDC-0449 and GANT-61 in
human breast cancer cell lines and murine TUBO cells.
GANT-61 was more effective than GDC-0449 in reducing
the survival of breast cancer cells. In particular, GANT-61
at doses ranging from 5 to 20 µM significantly reduced
the survival of 7/8 tested cell lines after 48 hours and in all
cell lines after 72 hours of treatment relative to the vehicle
control. GDC-0449 significantly decreased cell survival
in all cell lines only at the highest dose (12 µM) after 72
hours, 96 hours or 6 days of treatment. In addition, GANT61 treatment induced apoptosis and altered the cell cycle
distribution more effectively than GDC-0449. Specifically,
GANT-61 increased the percentage of cells in sub-G1
phase, in all breast cancer cell lines investigated after 48
hours, whereas GDC-0449 exhibited this effect only in 4
cell lines after 6 days of treatment.
The activation of apoptosis by GDC-0449 and
GANT-61 was confirmed by PARP-1 cleavage or downregulation and/or an increase in the ratio of the proapoptotic protein Bax to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
In addition, GANT-61 inhibited Hh pathway activity
more potently than GDC-0449, as demonstrated by the
decreased mRNA levels of GLI1 and Ptch after treatment
with these compounds. Hh pathway activation leads to
the transcription of Hh target gene products, including
ubiquitous genes such as GLI1 and Ptch1 and cell-specific
genes [3]. Furthermore, based on immunofluorescence
analysis, GANT-61 inhibited the translocation of GLI1
to the nucleus and thereby blocked the activation of GLI
target genes. After GANT-61 treatment, nuclear GLI1
expression was reduced in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells.
These findings suggest the importance of targeting
the Hh pathway using antagonists that act downstream of
SMO [41]. This is a more efficient strategy for interrupting
Hh signaling considering the presence of SMO mutations
and of the “non-canonical” mechanism of GLI protein
activation in cancer. Recent studies have shown that
mutant forms of SMO are resistant to SMO antagonists
such as GDC-0449 [42-44]. Other studies reported that
GANT-61 inhibits GLI1/GLI2 in colon cancer cells that
are resistant to the SMO inhibitors cyclopamine and GDC0449; this observation suggests SMO-independent Hh
signaling pathway activation in colon cancer [38].
Thus, the “non-canonical” activation of the Hh
signaling pathway in cancer leads to the transcription
of GLI target genes in a SMO-independent manner via
alternative signaling pathways. All “non-canonical”
activation mechanisms described herein act together
with the Hh pathway downstream of SMO. For example,
the Ras and TGF-β pathways induce GLI gene activity
in a ligand-independent manner [45]. Furthermore,
accumulating evidence indicate that a complex interplay
can occur between the ErbB receptor, Hh and NF-κB
pathways. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of
GDC-0449 and GANT-61 on the ErbB receptor and NFκB signaling pathways in breast cancer cell lines. The

responses of the cells to GDC-0449 or GANT-61 treatment
varied according to the cell line. Indeed, breast cancer
cell lines display different receptor (ER, PR, ErbB2)
expression profiles and different levels of normal and
mutated signaling proteins (p53, Ras) [26-31]. Intra-tumor
and inter-tumor heterogeneity are features of neoplasia.
Established human cell lines are derived from human
breast cancer tissues or pleural effusions. Thus, breast
cancer cell lines display the same genomic alterations
as cancer tissues. The responses of such cells lines
therefore might predict the resistance of cancer tissues
to treatment. Drug resistance might involve a single or
multiple signaling pathway alterations [46]. However, no
correlation between the drug response and the alteration of
any specific signaling pathway was detected. For example,
GANT-61 induced PARP-1 cleavage in both MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-468 cells, which express wild type and mutated
p53, respectively. Activation of the extrinsic or intrinsic
apoptotic signaling pathways could be responsible for the
observed responses.
GANT-61 altered the protein expression of EGFR
and ErbB2. In contrast, GDC-0449 had no effect on the
ErbB2 protein level and induced a slight decrease in the
EGFR expression level only in T47-D cells. Interestingly,
overexpressing neu TUBO cells increased EGFR
expression, and the neu expression level did not change
after GANT-61 treatment. A similar result was observed
in MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells, in which
GANT-61 treatment increased the EGFR protein level
but had no effect on ErbB2 expression. In these cells,
we also observed the induction of apoptosis. Rush et al.
recently reported that EGFR might trigger apoptosis to
prevent prolonged EGFR signaling, which might result
from EGFR overexpression or defective EGFR signaling
attenuation [47].
In addition, GANT-61 significantly inhibited p21Ras expression; further studies are needed to elucidate
the mechanism by which GANT-61 exerts this effect.
MAPKs are the intracellular effectors of ErbB receptors
(EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and hyperactivation
of the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway frequently
occurs in human cancer and is associated with increased
cell survival and proliferation [48]. Here, we demonstrate
that MAPK activity was down-regulated by GANT-61
in breast cancer cells. In particular, GANT-61 treatment
inhibited ERK1/2 activation in ER- and PR-negative
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-453 cells) and completely abolished ERK1/2
activation in TUBO cells, leading to the overexpression of
ErbB2/neu. In contrast, GDC-0449 reduced the p-ERK1/2
levels only in MCF-7 cells. GANT-61 also inhibited the
phosphorylation and activation of the pro-survival kinase
AKT, which induces tumor growth. Indeed, AKT promotes
cell survival and apoptosis resistance by sequestering
various protein targets, including the FOXO family of
forkhead transcription factors and the pro-apoptotic protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Bad, and by activating the pro-survival transcription factor
NF-κB [49]. However, GANT-61 inhibited NF-κB activity
by blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in MCF-7
and SK-BR-3 cells.
Overall, our results suggest that both GDC-0449 and
GANT-61 control Hh/ErbB/NF-κB signaling pathways in
vitro, although the GLI1 inhibitor was more effective than
the SMO inhibitor. Several studies and phase I clinical
trials have shown that GDC-0449 has a good human safety
profile, low plasma clearance, good oral bioavailability
(13-53%), metabolic stability in hepatocytes, good
absorption and wide distribution to tissues [50-52]. GDC0449 was administered at a dose of 150 mg daily, and its
maximum plasma concentrations were approximately
3.58 µM and 23 µM for single and repeated doses,
respectively [50-53]. Accordingly, the GDC-0449 doses
that we employed in our in vitro experiments (3-25 µM)
are in agreement with its plasma concentrations in treated
patients.
In addition, GDC-0449 has been effective in
the treatment of solid organ tumors such as BCC and
medulloblastoma [53, 54]. With respect to its efficacy in
mouse models, GDC-0449 (12.5 mg/kg) has been shown
to induce complete tumor regression in an allograft mouse
model of medulloblastoma that is entirely dependent on
the Hh pathway for growth [23]. GDC-0449 significantly
reduced liver fibrosis and the tumor burden in aged Mdr2deficient mice that already exhibited advanced liver
fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [55] and blocked the
growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell xenografts
in mice [56].
Concerning GANT-61, a recent study reported
the in vivo antitumor potential of this Hh inhibitor in
neuroblastoma. Mice subcutaneously injected into the
flank with neuroblastoma cells were treated orally through
gastric feeding with GANT-61 (50 mg/kg), and a reduction
of 63% in tumor volume was observed in comparison with
the control treatment [57].
Given these observations, we evaluated the in vivo
therapeutic potential of these two Hh inhibitors in BALB/c
mice that were subcutaneously inoculated into the right
flank with TUBO cells and simultaneously treated per os
with 2 mg of GDC-0449, GANT-61 or vehicle alone per
mouse. Overall, our results indicated that the Hh inhibitors
specifically interfered with TUBO tumor cell growth to
varying extents. Indeed, considering the survival of
BALB/c mice, the risk of TUBO tumor cell growth in the
corn oil-treated group was 0.016 and 49.40 relative to the
GDC-0449 and GANT-61-treated groups, respectively. In
addition, the risk of TUBO tumor cell growth in the GDC0449-treated group was 17.81 relative to the GANT-61treated group. Mice treated with GDC-0449 or GANT-61
showed a significant decrease in the mean tumor volume
compared with control mice (48% decrease for GDC-0449,
75% decrease for GANT-61) after 3 weeks of treatment.
GDC-0449 increased the survival of BALB/c mice by only

one week compared with the control mice (p = 0.0009).
In contrast, TUBO cell growth was counteracted in mice
treated with GANT-61; in 4/5 mice treated with GANT-61,
we observed complete tumor regression after 6 weeks of
treatment.
Our results provide evidence that GDC-0449 and
GANT-61 suppress the growth of human and mouse breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, although to different
extents. However, the GLI1 inhibitor blocked the Hh
pathway more effectively than the SMO inhibitor, likely
because cancer cells exhibit “non-canonical” activation of
the Hh pathway, which is caused by alternative signaling
pathways (ErbB receptors, NF-κB, Wnt, and Notch) [58].
To date, SMO inhibitors have mainly been employed to
target Hh signaling. However, resistance to the presently
employed SMO inhibitors has been found in BCC patients.
Thus, drugs directly inhibiting GLI transcription factors
will also be helpful in the treatment of tumors harboring
mutations in SMO or in factors downstream of SMO (e.g.,
SuFu) [41].
Overall, GANT61 inhibits cell growth, DNA
damage repair, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer
stem cell survival and induces apoptosis, autophagy and
inflammatory responses [41]. Accordingly, it is important
to develop new breast cancer therapies based on the
combination of Hh pathway inhibitors and ErbB2, EGFR,
Wnt and Notch signaling inhibitors.

left over from sampling procedures that were employed
for diagnostic purposes. Areas of interest from breast
carcinoma specimens were identified on corresponding
H&E-stained sections and marked on the donor paraffin
block. A 3-mm-thick core of the donor block was placed
in the recipient master block of a Galileo TMA CK2500
(Brugherio, Milano, Italy). Three cores from different
areas of the same tissue block were arrayed for each case
(the total amount of neoplastic cells was not less than
1500) [59]. For immunohistochemistry, 4-µm paraffin
sections from TMA were deparaffinized, rehydrated and
quenched in a 0.2% hydrogen peroxide solution diluted
in methanol. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 5 min
in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris, BSA 2% horse
serum, and 0.02% sodium azide. After pretreatment for
30 min at 100°C in EDTA citric buffer, the sections were
immunolabeled for 1 hour at room temperature with the
primary antibodies anti-ER (prediluted; rabbit monoclonal
antibody SP1; Ventana, Tucson, AZ USA), anti-PR
(prediluted; rabbit monoclonal antibody 1E2; Ventana,
Tucson, AZ USA), anti-Her2/neu (prediluted; rabbit
monoclonal antibody 4B5; Ventana, Tucson, AZ USA),
anti-EGFR (prediluted; rabbit monoclonal antibody 5B7;
Ventana, Tucson, AZ USA), anti-NF-κB (1:100 diluted;
mouse polyclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA), anti-GLI1 (1:100 diluted; rabbit polyclonal
antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) and antiShh (1:200 diluted; rabbit polyclonal antibody; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). This step was followed
by a 15 min incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse
IgG (prediluted; Dako Denmark, Glostrup Denmark) and
by a 15-min incubation with avidin-peroxidase complex
(prediluted; Dako Denmark, Glostrup Denmark). The
reactions were revealed with a Universal DAB Detection
Kit (Dako Denmark, Glostrup Denmark) [60].
The semiquantitative expression of GLI1, Shh,
and NF-κB in the carcinoma specimens was estimated
at x200 magnification in at least 10 fields by two
investigators in a blind fashion. A previously described
score system with minor modifications was used. The
staining intensity was semi-quantitatively classified as
negative (-), weakly positive (+), and overexpressed (2+
and 3+). The percentage of cells with positive staining
was assessed independently. A tumor was considered

negative for ER and PR expression if < 5% of tumor
cell nuclei were stained. The HER2 expression level was
scored on the basis of membrane staining intensity as
follows: 0 (negative) and 1 + (discontinuous and weak)
staining were considered negative, 2 + (continuous and
weak to moderate) staining was considered borderline,
and 3 + (continuous and strong) was considered positive.
Borderline cases have been solved by FISH analysis.
Accordingly, the presence of less than two copies of the
HER2 gene was scored as negative, and that of two or
more copies was scored as positive. Nuclear grading was
assessed by evaluating the nuclear size, monomorphism
or pleomorphism, the dispersion of chromatin, and the
number of nucleoli and mitosis, and they were scored as
low (G1), intermediate (G2) and high (G3) [61].

GDC-0449 or GANT-61 was calculated by normalizing
their O.D. values to those of control cultures treated with
DMSO [63]. The experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated three times.

FACS analysis
Asynchronized, log-phase growing cells (60%
confluent, approximately 2.5 x 105/well in 6-well plates)
were treated with GDC-0449, GANT-61 or DMSO in
complete culture medium. After 96 hours or 6 days for
GDC-0449 (3-6-12-25 µM) or 48 hours for GANT-61
(5-10-20 µM), adherent as well as suspended cells were
harvested, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and washed
twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell
pellets were resuspended in 70% ethanol and incubated for
1 hour at -20°C. The cells were then washed twice with
cold PBS, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min, incubated
for 1 hour in the dark with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml
final concentration in 0.1% citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100)
and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur
cytometer with CellQuest software [49].

Cell lines and treatments
BALB-neuT mammary cancer cells (H-2d) (TUBO)
that overexpress activated rat ErbB2/neu were kindly
provided by Prof. G. Forni (University of Torino, Italy)
[62]. Human (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDAMB-468, T47-D, MCF-7, BT-474, and SK-BR-3) and
mouse breast cancer cell lines (TUBO) and human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells were maintained in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin (complete medium). The cells were grown
at 37°C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of
5% CO2.
GDC-0449 and GANT-61 were dissolved in DMSO.
For the treatments, the cells were incubated for the
indicated times in the presence of GDC-0449 (dose range:
3-25 µM), GANT-61 (dose range: 1-20 µM) or a vehicle
control (DMSO ≤ 0.1%).

RNA isolation and real-time q-PCR
Cells were seeded at 2 x 105 cells/well in 6-well
plates and incubated at 37°C to allow cell attachment.
After 24 hours, the cells were treated with GDC-0449 (50
µM for 48 h; 12-25 µM for 24 h), GANT-61 (20 µM for 48
h) or DMSO. After incubation, the cells were harvested,
washed twice with PBS and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for
10 min.
The total RNA from the cells was extracted using
TRI Reagent Solution (AmbionTM, Life Technologies,
Italy), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
cDNA synthesis was performed with a SuperScript II FirstStrand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Italy).
A quantitative real-time PCR analysis of hGLI1, hGLI2,
hIkbα, hPtch1, mGLI1, mGLI2, mPtch1, mIkbα, hHPRT,
hB2M, hTBP, mHPRT, mB2M, and mTBP messenger
RNA (mRNA) was performed on cDNA using TaqMan
gene expression assays according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies,
Italy) and an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems,
Life Technologies, Italy) as previously described [64].
Each amplification reaction was performed in triplicate,
and the average of the three threshold cycles was used to
calculate the amount of transcripts in the sample (SDS
software; ABI). mRNA quantification was expressed, in
arbitrary units, as the ratio of the sample quantity to the
calibrator or to the mean values of the control samples.
All values were normalized to three endogenous controls,
namely HPRT, B2M, and TBP.

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
Cells were seeded at 5x103/well in 96-well plates
and incubated at 37°C to allow cell attachment. After 24
hours, the medium was changed and the cells were treated
with GDC-0449 or DMSO and incubated for 48 hours,
72 hours, 96 hours or 6 days at concentrations of 3-6-12
µM, or with GANT-61 or DMSO and then incubated for
48 and 72 hours at concentrations of 1-2.5-5-10-20 µM.
The cells were then fixed with cold trichloroacetic acid
(final concentration 10%) for 1 h at 4°C. After 4 washes
with distilled water, the plates were air-dried and stained
for 30 min with 0.4% (wt/vol) SRB in 1% acetic acid.
After 4 washes with 1% acetic acid to remove the unbound
dye, the plates were air-dried, and cell-bound SRB was
dissolved with 200 µl/well of 10 mM unbuffered Tris base
solution. The optical density (O.D.) of the samples was
determined at 540 nm with a spectrophotometric plate
reader. The percentage survival of the cultures treated with

the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. A veterinary surgeon was present during the
experiments. The animal care both before and after the
experiments was performed only by trained personnel.
Mice were bred under pathogen-free conditions in the
animal facilities of Tor Vergata University and handled
in compliance with European Union and institutional
standards for animal research.

Approximately 1 x 106 cells were seeded in 100mm tissue culture dishes 24 hours prior to the addition of
12 μM GDC-0449, 10 μM GANT-61 or vehicle control.
After 48 hours (for GANT-61) or 6 days (for GDC-0449)
of incubation, the cells were harvested, washed twice with
cold PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Triton X-100
1%, SDS 0.1%, NaCl 200 mM, Tris HCl 50 mM pH 7.5,
PMSF 1 mM, and NaOV 1 mM). After 30 min at 4°C,
the mixtures were centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min
and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting.
For immunoblotting analysis, 50 μg of cell lysates were
resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes
were incubated with specific primary antibodies at 1-2
μg/ml concentrations overnight at 4°C. After being
washed, the filters were incubated with goat anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and
developed by chemiluminescence as previously described
[65]. A densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands
was performed with Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, USA) after blot scanning.

Analysis of antitumor activity in vivo
Tumor growth was monitored weekly until tumorbearing mice were sacrificed at the first signs of distress or
when their tumors exceeded 20 mm in diameter [67]. The
tumors were measured with a caliper in two dimensions
and the volumes were calculated by using the following
formula: width2 x length/2 [68].

Statistical analysis
Differences in GLI1, Shh and NF-κB expression and
their association with clinico-pathological parameters were
evaluated using Fisher’s exact test and Student’s t-test.
Values with p≤ 0.05 were considered significant. The data
distribution of cell survival and the FACS analyses were
preliminarily verified by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and
data sets were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls test. Differences
in GLI1 or Ptch mRNA expression levels and the intensity
of immunoreactive bands were evaluated by a two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Values with p≤ 0.05 were considered
significant. Survival curves and tumor multiplicity were
estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by logrank test (Mantel-Cox). Differences in tumor volumes
were regarded as significant when the p value was ≤ 0.05
[66].

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded at 4 x 104 cells/well in 8-well
chamber slides and, after 24 hours, they were treated with
10 μM GANT, or with vehicle control. After 24 hours, the
cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed
and fixed in methanol for 5 min at -20°C, then washed
and incubated with GLI1 polyclonal antibody overnight
at 4°C or with NF-κB monoclonal antibody for 1 hour at
room temperature. After additional washings, the cells
were labeled with a goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor594-conjugated antibody for 30 min [66]. After a third
washing, the cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst
33342 and mounted under a cover slip with glycerol. The
cells were observed with an Olympus BX51 microscope.

In vivo treatment of BALB/c mice with GDC-0449
or GANT-61
Groups of 6-to-8-week-old BALB/c female mice
(5 mice per group) were subcutaneously inoculated in the
right flank with 0.2 ml of suspension containing 1x106
TUBO cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
treated per os with GDC-0449 (2 mg dissolved in 100
µl of corn oil-ethanol in a 4:1 ratio, 3 times per week),
GANT-61 (2 mg dissolved in 100 µl of corn oil-ethanol in
