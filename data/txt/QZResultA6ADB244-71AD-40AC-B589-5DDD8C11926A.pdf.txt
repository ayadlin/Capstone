ABSTRACT
Purpose
Patients who do not complete one cycle of therapy on Phase I trials for reasons
other than dose limiting toxicity (DLT) are considered inevaluable for toxicity and
must be replaced.

Methods
Individual records from patients enrolled to NCI-sponsored Phase I trials
activated between 2000 and 2010 were used. Early discontinuation was defined as
the failure to begin cycle 2 for reasons other than a DLT during cycle 1. A multinomial
logistic regression with a 3-level nominal outcome (early discontinuation, DLT during
cycle 1, and continuation to cycle 2) was used with continuation to cycle 2 serving
as the reference category. The final model was used to create two risk scores. An
independent external cohort was used to validate these models.

Results
Data from 3079 patients on 127 Phase I trials were analyzed. ECOG performance
status (1, ≥ 2, two-sided P = .0315 and P = .0007), creatinine clearance (<60 ml/
min, P = .0455), alkaline phosphatase (>2.5xULN, P = .0026), AST (>ULN, P = .0076),
hemoglobin (<10 g/dL, P < .0001), albumin (<3.5 g/dL, P < .0001), and platelets
(<400x109/L, P = .0732) were predictors of early discontinuation. The c-index of
the final model was 0.63.

Conclusion
Knowledge of risk factors for early treatment discontinuation in conjunction with
clinical judgment can help guide Phase I patient selection.

INTRODUCTION

lymphoma. Patients were required to meet a common
set of Phase I laboratory criteria as follows: absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/
dL, platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5x upper limit
of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin ≤ 2x ULN. This
led to the exclusion of 5% of patients in the derivation
dataset, reducing the number of patients from 3910 to
3717. Patients with incomplete data for one or more of
the covariates included in the final multivariate model
were also excluded. On this basis, 17% (N = 638) of the
3717 patients in the derivation set were excluded. Baseline
characteristics of patients with complete and missing
data were largely similar (data not shown). All patients
had regular follow-up visits as specified by the protocol
to which they were enrolled. Patients must have received
at least one dose of study drug(s) to be included in the
analysis.
An independent cohort of 232 patients consecutively
enrolled to 20 Phase I trials between 2009 and 2012 in
the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was used as a validation
set. CTEP-sponsored studies included in the derivation set
were excluded from this cohort. Patients and trials in the
validation set were required to meet the same eligibility
criteria as the derivation set.

Phase I eligibility criteria are intended to select
fit patients with good performance status, near normal
organ function, and minimal co-morbidities in order to
accurately characterize the toxicity of the investigational
drug [1–5]. In addition, patients with poor performance
status or compromised organ function may be at increased
risk for exacerbation of cancer symptoms, rapid disease
progression, and death, thus necessitating discontinuation
of protocol treatment during the first cycle [6–11]. Patient
satisfaction with the Phase I experience may be adversely
impacted by early discontinuation and their participation
may delay implementation of more appropriate palliative
care services [12–14]. Morever, patients who do not
complete at least one cycle of therapy on Phase I trials
for reasons other than dose limiting toxicity (DLT) are
typically considered inevaluable for toxicity and must
therefore be replaced [15]. Early discontinuation leads to
delays in dose escalation as cohorts are backfilled and adds
additional costs to the conduct of these studies.
Unfortunately, early trial discontinuation remains
a fairly common event in Phase I studies despite strict
entry criteria. In one large series, 16% of patients enrolled
to Phase I trials discontinued protocol therapy within
the first 21 days of beginning treatment [7]. Although
prognostic risk scores are available to estimate the 90day overall survival of Phase I trial participants, little is
known about what factors put patients at risk for early
trial discontinuation. No risk score or predictive model
is available to estimate the risk of early discontinuation
among Phase I eligible patients. In order to address this
unmet need, we analyzed the individual patient records
from a large cohort of 3079 patients enrolled to 127
National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored Phase I clinical
trials from 67 institutions throughout North America with
the aim of identifying risk factors and developing a risk
score for early discontinuation.

Outcome
The primary outcome for each patient was early
discontinuation (yes/no), which was defined as: 1) the
inability to begin cycle 2 of therapy, and 2) the absence of
any dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. The DLT
criteria were standardized to allow for a uniform outcome
definition across all trials and were defined as a grade
≥ 3 non-hematologic or grade ≥ 4 hematologic toxicity
attributed as at least possibly related to study treatment,
excluding asymptomatic electrolyte abnormalities.
Toxicity level data were used to determine whether each
patient had an adverse event that qualified under this
definition of DLT. These DLT criteria are commonly used
in contemporary Phase I studies [15, 18].

METHODS
Study design and patient eligibility

Candidate factors

A multicenter cohort of all patients treated on NCIsponsored [16] Phase I trials activated between 2000 and
2010 who met the following inclusion and exclusion
criteria was used for model and risk score derivation.
Data were provided from the Clinical Trials Monitoring
System (CTMS) database, which is managed by Theradex
Systems, Inc. The CTMS database is prospectively
maintained with robust data management and auditing
practices [17]. Trials of vaccines, immunotherapy,
radiation therapy, loco-regional therapies, and autologous
or allogeneic stem cell transplant were excluded. Organ
dysfunction studies were also excluded. Eligible patients
were adults (≥ 18 years) with solid tumors excluding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The following categories of baseline patient
characteristics were investigated for their association with
early trial discontinuation: 1) commonly utilized Phase
I eligibility criteria, 2) established prognostic factors, 3)
prior treatment exposure, and 4) disease burden.

Model and risk score building and validation
All variables except ECOG performance status (PS)
were dichotomized to facilitate the final goal of creating
a simple risk score. Cutoffs were chosen based on upper
limit of normal and/or cutoffs defined by the NCI Common
19317

Oncotarget

Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE), most
commonly using the criteria for grade 1 abnormalities.
For certain covariates, grade 1 abnormalities were very
common and would therefore have been of limited
discriminatory utility and in those cases criteria for
grade 2 abnormalities were utilized. Similarly, cutoffs
that would identify a small minority of patients and thus
have limited clinical utility and statistical properties were
avoided. ECOG PS was treated as a categorical variable
with three levels: 0, 1, and ≥ 2. Due to concern about the
heterogeneity of the patients who did not discontinue early
(this group contains both patients who experienced a DLT
during cycle 1 and patients who began cycle 2 without
a DLT), multinomial logistic regression with a 3-level
nominal outcome (early discontinuation as defined above,
DLT during cycle 1, and continuation to cycle 2) was
used to assess relationships between factors and outcome.
Continuation to cycle 2 was the reference category.
Candidate factors for the multivariate model were
selected based on clinical reasoning and univariate
results, and the final model was selected using a
backward selection procedure where variables with the
largest discontinuation-specific P-value (ie, the P-value
associated with the odds ratio for early discontinuation
versus continuation to cycle 2) were sequentially
removed until all discontinuation-specific P-values were
< 0.10. The final logistic model assigns each patient a
predicted risk of cycle 1 DLT, early discontinuation, and
continuation to cycle 2. The binary outcome for model
validation was early discontinuation (yes/no), with cycle
1 DLT and continuation to cycle 2 combined. Predictive
accuracy of the multinomial logistic model was evaluated
with the concordance-index (c-index), which estimates the
proportion of pairs where the patient who discontinued
early has a higher model-predicted risk of early
discontinuation than the patient who did not discontinue
early.
The final multinomial model (based on Hosmer
equations 8.1 to 8.5 [19]) was used to create two risk
scores. In the expanded risk score, points were assigned
to each risk factor in order to best preserve the ranking of
the patients’ risk of early discontinuation assigned by the
full model, while ensuring that the model was not overly
complex [20]. A simplified risk score was subsequently
developed in which only the strongest factors (those
assigned 2 points in the expanded risk score) contribute
one point each. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals
for sensitivity, specificity, and overall correct classification
rate were calculated using exact confidence intervals for
binomial proportions.
The risk scores were dichotomized at various cutoff
points to define patients at low and high risk of early
discontinuation. Overall correct classification rate was
defined as the percent of patients who were classified
correctly: either as low risk and did not discontinue early,
or as high risk and did discontinue early. Two cutoffs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(5 for the expanded risk score, and 2 for the simplified
risk score) were selected based on their performance in the
CTEP data, with an emphasis on high specificity, which
translates to a low probability of classifying patients who
did not discontinue early as high risk. These were then
validated on an external dataset. C-index, sensitivity,
specificity, and overall correct classification rate were
used to assess full model performance and risk score
performance in the external data.
All statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R 3.0.1 (R Foundation,
Vienna, Austria) using the pROC and verification
packages. All P-values were two-sided, and P-values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics, derivation set
Data on 3079 patients treated on 127 Phase I
trials were analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics
are presented in Table 1. A broad range of tumor types
was represented. The median number of prior systemic
therapies was 3 (range, 0–19). Median values of
pretreatment hemoglobin, platelets, calculated creatinine
clearance, AST, and ALT were all within the range of
normal (data not shown). In total, 508 (16.5%) patients
met criteria for early discontinuation. Sixty-one percent
(N = 312) discontinued early for clinical progression or
death, 23% (N = 115) for an adverse event that was not
a DLT, and 2% (N = 10) for other reasons. No off study
reason was provided for 14% (N = 71) of the patients who
discontinued early.

Model building and validation
The association of baseline patient characteristics to
the likelihood of early trial discontinuation was examined
in the derivation set by both univariate and multivari­
ate analysis. The results of these analyses are presented
in Table 2. On univariate analysis, higher ECOG PS
(P  =  0.0008 and P < .0001 for PS 1, ≥ 2 respectively),
WBC (P = 0.0005), platelet count (P < .0001), AST (P <
.0001), alkaline phosphatase (P < .0001), ALT (P = 0.0305),
number of prior lines of therapy (P = 0.0554, P = 0.0063
for 3, ≥ 4 respectively) and lower hemoglobin (P < .0001),
creatinine clearance (P = 0.0289), number of metastatic
sites (P = 0.0753, P = 0.0421 and P = 0.0076 for 1, 2 and ≥
3 respectively), and albumin (P < .0001) were significantly
associated with the risk of early discontinuation. Primary
tumor site was not considered a candidate for the
multivariate model because we did not wish to discriminate
against specific tumor types. Similarly, prior lines of therapy
and number of metastatic sites were not candidates for the
final model because we did not wish to exclude broad
groups of patients who constitute a significant proportion

of the Phase I eligible population from participation in these
studies. Other significant variables were carried forward
to a multivariate model, where WBC, ALT, and absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC) were not independent predictors
of early discontinuation (P > 0.10) and were subsequently
removed from the model, yielding the final model. The
final multivariate model, accounting for ECOG PS (1, ≥ 2,
P =  0.0315 and P = 0.0007 respectively), creatinine
clearance (< 60 ml/min, P = 0.0455), alkaline phosphatase
(> 2.5xULN, P  = 0.0026), AST (> ULN, P = 0.0076),
hemoglobin (<10 g/dL, P < .0001), albumin (< 3.5 g/dL,
P < .0001), and platelet count (< 400 x109/L, P = 0.0732)
had a c-index of 0.63 in the derivation set. The c-index of
this model with all the covariates included as continuous
except ECOG PS was 0.64, and the c-index of our final
model with the additional covariates number of prior lines
of treatment and number of metastatic sites is 0.64; thus
we feel that our modeling choices did not lead to decreased
model performance. The odds ratios for both outcomes of
the final multinomial model are shown in Supplemental
Table 1A. The performance of the final multivariate model
was also assessed in an independent external validation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

set (N = 232). The rate of early discontinuation in the
validation set was 15%. The derivation and validation
sets were well balanced with regards to the presence
of factors independently associated with the risk of
early discontinuation (see Supplemental Table 2A).
The cumulative distribution of predicted risk of early
discontinuation in the derivation and external validation sets
was also similar, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The c-index
of the final model in the external validation set was 0.61.

Risk score performance
In order to create a user-friendly clinical decision
aid, two risk scores were developed utilizing the final
multivariate model and assessed for performance. The
two proposed risks scores and their associated sensitivity,
specificity, and overall correct classification rate (OCCR)
in both the derivation and validation sets are shown in
Table 3. An expanded risk score assigns 2 points each
for: ECOG PS (≥ 2), alkaline phosphatase (> 2.5xULN),
hemoglobin (< 10 g/dL), and albumin (< 3.5 g/dL), and
1 point each for: ECOG PS (= 1), creatinine clearance

and validation sets. The performance of the risk scores in

rate of the overall population (16.5%). By comparison,
patients with none of these risk factors had only a 12%
chance of discontinuing early, a relative risk reduction of
27% compared to the overall population. Both risk scores
had similar performance in the derivation and validation
sets, suggesting they are generalizable to new patient
populations. Additionally, the risk scores performed
similarly when assessed in the subset of patients who
received molecular targeted agents only, indicating
that these scores will continue to be relevant as drug
development becomes more focused on these agents.
To illustrate how using the simplified risk score
would impact patient selection and the composition
of Phase I trials, Figure 3 shows the results of limiting
accrual in the derivation cohort to patients with < 2
points on the simplified risk score. Enrollment of 11.9%
(367/3079) patients would be curtailed by applying a
cutoff of ≥ 2 points on the simplified risk score. The rate
of early discontinuation in the remaining patients would
be 14.6% (395/2712), compared to 16.5% (508/3079)
in the original derivation set. In total, 113 fewer patients
would discontinue early and 22.2% (113/508) of all
early discontinuations would be avoided at the expense
of curtailing enrollment by 367 patients. This cutoff
would improperly exclude only 10% of those who do
not discontinue early at the expense of failing to identify
78% of the patients who do discontinue early. This
cutoff was chosen to minimize the impact on the overall
pool of Phase I eligible patients while still providing
a decrease in the number of patients who discontinue
early. However, it is important to note that this cutoff
would also improperly exclude 7 patients for every 3
patients accurately excluded. This “false positive” rate
represents an important obstacle to the use of these scores
in routine clinical practice. Even if these risk scores were
implemented, early discontinuation rates would remain >
10%. It is therefore important that Phase I study sponsors
account for this potentially unavoidable feature of the
Phase I patient population when designing and conducting
these studies. Study designs that minimize the need for
delays in patient enrollment and dose escalation when
one or more patients are inevaluable for toxicity due to
early treatment discontinuation offer potentially significant
advantages in the conduct of these studies [23].
Unfortunately, the number of patients seeking Phase
I trials often exceeds study availability at high volume
centers. As such, physicians often must select from multiple
potentially eligible patients for a limited number of study
spots. In doing so, physicians attempt to identify which
patients are most likely to remain on study long enough to
potentially benefit. Currently, physicians must rely solely
on clinical experience to make these difficult judgments.
In these circumstances, we believe that even highly expert
Phase I investigators can benefit from the knowledge of
how a limited number of objective patient characteristics
may increase the risk of early treatment discontinuation.

DISCUSSION
Utilizing individual patient records from a very
large, multi-institutional, contemporary cohort of North
American patients enrolled to Phase I trials, we identified
baseline clinical characteristics independently associated
with the risk of early trial discontinuation. To our
knowledge, this is the first such analysis performed to date.
We identified several factors independently associated with
early trial discontinuation including higher ECOG PS,
alkaline phosphatase, AST, and platelets and decreasing
albumin, hemoglobin, and creatinine clearance. These
results offer important insights to physicians charged with
selecting appropriate patients for Phase I trials.
Many of the risk factors identified here have
previously been shown to be prognostic in the Phase I
patient population [21]. Among patients who discontinue
treatment early for reasons other than DLT, 61% did
so for clinical disease progression or death and 23%
due to adverse events (both disease and drug-related).
These rates are very consistent with data reported by the
European Drug Development Network [7] and suggest
that our large multi-center derivation cohort accurately
reflects the contemporary Phase I population. These
data also suggest that the population of patients who
discontinue treatment early tend to have a poor prognosis.
The overlap of prognostic factors for 90-day survival
and early discontinuation, however, is not complete. For
example, although lymphopenia (ALC < 0.5 x 109/L) is
frequently cited as a prognostic factor, it did not predict for
early discontinuation after adjusting for other covariates.
Creatinine clearance, an independent predictor of early
discontinuation, is not a well established prognostic factor.
Moreover, the likelihood of early discontinuation due to
progression or death was similar in our overall population
and for patients with ≥ 2 points on our simplified risk
score (see Supplemental Table 4A). These data suggest
that patients who discontinue treatment early are not
always those with the poorest prognosis and that excluding
patients with poor prognosis does not eliminate early
treatment discontinuation.
Using insight provided from the multivariate
analysis, we created and externally validated two risk
scores to identify patients at significantly increased risk
for early discontinuation prior to enrollment. To arrive at
this simplified risk score, we chose the risk factors with
the greatest effect on early discontinuation (ECOG PS
≥ 2, albumin ≤ 3.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x
ULN, and hemoglobin ≤ 10 mg/dL). Patients with ≥ 2 of
these risk factors prior to enrollment had an observed rate
of early discontinuation of 31%, approximately twice the
