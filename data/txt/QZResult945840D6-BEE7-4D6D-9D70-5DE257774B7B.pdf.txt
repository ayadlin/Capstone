Abstract
Genistein (4¶,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) is the most abundant
isoflavone found in the soybean. The effects of genistein on
various cancer cell lines have been extensively studied but the
precise molecular mechanisms are not known. We report here
the epigenetic mechanism of the action of genistein on
androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (DuPro)
human prostate cancer cell lines. Genistein induced the
expression of tumor suppressor genes p21 (WAF1/CIP1/
KIP1) and p16 (INK4a) with a concomitant decrease in cyclins.
There was a G0-G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP cells and a G2-M
arrest in DuPro cells after genistein treatment. Genistein also
induced apoptosis in DuPro cells. DNA methylation analysis
revealed the absence of p21 promoter methylation in both cell
lines. The effect of genistein on chromatin remodeling has not
been previously reported. We found that genistein increased
acetylated histones 3, 4, and H3/K4 at the p21 and p16
transcription start sites. Furthermore, we found that genistein
treatment also increased the expression of histone acetyl
transferases that function in transcriptional activation. This is
the first report on epigenetic regulation of various genes by
genistein through chromatin remodeling in prostate cancer.
Altogether, our data provide new insights into the epigenetic
mechanism of the action of genistein that may contribute to
the chemopreventive activity of this dietary isoflavone and
have important implications for epigenetic therapy. [Cancer

Introduction
Genistein is believed to be a potent anticancer agent and has
been shown to prevent carcinogenesis in animal models for tumor
development at different organ sites (1). Many mechanisms have
been proposed for this activity. Some are believed to be closely
related to the estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of genistein
(1). Prepubertal exposure to soy or genistein reduced mammary
carcinogenesis in rats treated with carcinogens, possibly by modulating the development of the mammary end buds (2). Various soy
products containing genistein have been found to inhibit the
growth of transplanted human prostate carcinoma, reduce the
incidence of poorly differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma in a

transgenic mouse model, and inhibit 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5]pyridine–induced rat prostate carcinogenesis (3).
Carcinogenesis or metastasis in the stomach, colon, bladder, and
lung is also inhibited by genistein and related isoflavones (4–6).
Cell cycle progression is regulated by interactions between
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; ref. 7). Especially, the
transition of G1 to S phase is regulated by a family of negative cell
cycle regulators, CDKIs. The latter includes two families, the CIP/
KIP family and the INK4 family (8). P21WAF1 is a member of the
CIP/KIP family and p16INK4a belongs to INK4 family (9), and their
increased expression may play a crucial role in the growth arrest
induced in transformed cells (10).
p16INK4a is a component of p16INK4a-Cdk4-6/cyclin D-pRb
signaling pathway, which is perturbed in many tumors. It specifically binds to and inactivates D-type CDKs, CDK4, and CDK6
(11). The binding of p16INK4a to CDK4/6 also induces redistribution of Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p21WAF1 and p27KIP1, from
cyclinD-CDK4/6 to cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, resulting in the
inactivation of CDK2-kinase (12). Thus, induction of p16INK4a
collaborates with p21WAF1 to prevent phosphorylation of pRb,
leading to a stable cell cycle arrest in senescent cells (13). Importantly, the p16INK4a gene is frequently inactivated in a wide
range of human cancers and is therefore recognized as a tumor
suppressor gene (13). The function of p16INK4a may be lost due to
mutations or suppression of transcription by promoter methylation in different types of tumors (14).
The p21 gene was first cloned and characterized as an important
effector that inhibited CDK activity in p53-mediated cell cycle
arrest induced by DNA damage (15). The stability of p21 mRNA
can also be altered by different signals such as cell differentiation
(16), oxidative stress (17), as well as other factors including decorin
(18), Ras/Raf protein (19), transforming growth factor B (20), and
Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (21). In addition, two
known mechanisms of epigenetic modification, gene inactivation
by methylation of the promoter region and changes to inactive
chromatin by histone deacetylation, may also be involved in the
inactivation of the CIP/KIP family (22). P21WAF1 is frequently
epigenetically silenced in human cancer, and histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor–induced increase in p21 WAF1 expression is
believed to play a major role in suppressing tumor growth (23). In a
variety of human neoplastic cell lines, p21WAF1 was re-expressed
after treatment with decitabine and both methylation-dependent
and methylation-independent mechanisms have been proposed to
explain this effect (24, 25). Although this gene is hypermethylated
in some human lung cancer cell lines (24), it is unmethylated
in most types of human cancers (26). A recent study has shown
that decitabine induced remodeling of p21WAF1 promoter chromatin and gene re-expression independent of p21WAF1 promoter

methylation or the presence of wild-type p53 (27). Genistein can
also up-regulate mRNA expression of BRCA1 gene during mammary tumorigenesis, which is frequently inactivated by epigenetic
events in breast cancer (2). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
cell lines, genistein was found to cause reversal of hypermethylation and reactivation of p16INK4a, RARb , and MGMT genes (28).
The precise molecular mechanism of genistein action is still not
clear. We hypothesize that genistein may be involved in regulation
of gene activity by modulating epigenetic events such as DNA
methylation and/or histone acetylation in prostate cancer. To test
this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of genistein in
modulating (a) the expression of CDK inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1/
KIP1, p16INK4a, and p27KIP1; (b) cell cycle progression and (c)
CpG island promoter methylation status; and (d) chromatin
remodeling in human prostate cancer cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. Human prostate carcinoma cell lines
LNCaP and DuPro and the normal epithelial prostate cell line RWPE-1
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The prostate
cancer cell lines were cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 Ag/mL penicillin, and 50 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained in an incubator with a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37jC. The RWPE-1
cells were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with
5 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 0.05 mg/mL
bovine pituitary extract (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) and maintained in
an incubator under the conditions described above. Subconfluent cells
(60–70% confluent) were treated with varying concentrations of genistein
(0, 10, and 25 Amol/L; Sigma) dissolved in DMSO, and the cells treated
only with vehicle (DMSO) served as control. Fresh genistein was

administered everyday along with change of medium, and the cells were
grown for 96 h.
DNA cell cycle analysis. The cells were harvested, washed with cold
PBS, and processed for cell cycle analysis. Briefly, 1  106 cells were
resuspended in 1 mL of cold saline GM (4jC) to which cold ethanol (3 mL)
was added, and the cells were then incubated for overnight at 4jC. After
centrifugation, the pellet was washed with 2 mL cold PBS + 5 mmol/L
EDTA, resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing 30 Ag/mL propidium iodide
and 0.3 mg/mL RNase A, and incubated at 25jC for 1 h in the dark. The cell
cycle distribution of the cells of each sample was then determined using a
FACS Caliber instrument (Becton Dickinson FACScan; Biosciences)
equipped with CellQuest 3.3 software in the Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS) Core Facility of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and
University of California, San Francisco. CellQuest cell cycle analysis software
was used to determine the percentage of cells in the different cell cycle
phases.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from 90%
confluent plates of cultured cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. First strand cDNA was prepared
from total RNA (1 Ag) and oligo(dT) using the Reverse Transcription System
(Promega Corp.).
In the real-time PCR step, cDNA was amplified with Inventoried Gene
Assay Products containing two gene-specific primers and one Taq Man
MGB probe (6-FAM dye labeled) using the Taq Man Universal Fast PCR
Master Mix in 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Thermal cycling conditions included 95jC for 20 s, 40 cycles of 95jC for
3 s, and 60jC for 30 s according to the Taq Man Fast Universal PCR
Protocol. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used
as an endogenous control, and vehicle control was used as a calibrator.
Each sample was run in four wells. The comparative computed tomography method was used to calculate the relative changes in gene expression in the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System. The relative changes of gene
expression were calculated using the following formula: fold change in
gene expression, 2 DDCt = 2-{DCt (genistein-treated samples) DCt (untreated control)},

Results
p21WAF1 and p16INK4a expression profile. To determine
relative expression levels of p16INK4a and p21WAF1 in prostate
cancer cells, we performed Taq Man quantitative real-time PCR
analysis for androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (DuPro) cell lines and compared them with normal prostate
epithelial cells (RWPE-1; Fig. 1A–B ). The results showed
that relative mRNA expression was significantly lower in PCa
cell lines when compared with normal RWPE-1 cell line. In addition, a significant difference in p21WAF1 expression was also
noted between the androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgenindependent (DuPro) PCa cell lines.
Effect of genistein treatment on the expression of cell cycle
regulators. The cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 is a well-characterized target of genistein (30). We analyzed the expression of
p21WAF1 along with other CDKIs, p16INK4a, and p27CIP1 in two
prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DuPro) and RWPE-1, a
normal prostate epithelial cell line (Fig. 1C). Genistein significantly
up-regulated the relative expression level of p21WAF1 and
p16INK4a over vehicle control, whereas there was no significant

change in the expression of p27CIP1 in both prostate cancer
cell lines. The same effect was also observed in RWPE cells where
there was also an increase in p27 mRNA levels with genistein
treatment compared with controls.
To verify whether the increased transcription of these genes
resulted in increased levels of their respective proteins, we did
Western analysis. Western blot analysis showed that the protein
levels of p21 and p16 were up-regulated in genistein-treated LNCaP
cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas that of cyclins were
down-regulated with increased concentration of genistein (Fig. 1D).
These results are in direct agreement with the reverse transcription-PCR data and show that genistein up-regulates transcription
and translation of the p21 and p16 genes.
Induction of cell cycle arrest. FACS analysis was done to test
the effect of genistein on cell cycle distribution. Cell cycle
progression is regulated by interactions between cyclins, CDKs,
and CDK inhibitors (31). Especially, the transition of G1 to S phase
is regulated by a family of negative cell cycle regulators, CDKIs.
As summarized in Fig. 2A and B, genistein treatment resulted in a
significantly higher number of LNCaP cells in the G0-G1 phase at
10 Amol/L (87.6%) and 25 Amol/L (91.1%; P < 0.05), compared with
vehicle-treated control (64.6%). There was concomitant reduction
in the number of cells in the S and G2-M phases, suggesting that
genistein induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest in androgen-sensitive
LNCaP cells. In androgen-insensitive DuPro cells, genistein treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in G2-M cells with
a significant decrease in S phase cells. Genistein (25 Amol/L)
also induced apoptosis (17%) in DuPro cells compared with vehicle

control (2%). In RWPE cells, genistein treatment caused an
insignificant increase in the percentage of cells in G0-G1 phase, but
a significant decrease was observed in the S phase of cells treated
with 10 or 25 Amol/L (8–10%) genistein over vehicle control (18%).
These results are consistent with the gene expression results that
showed up-regulation of p16 and p21 mRNA and protein levels in
genistein-treated cells. The CDK inhibitors are known to bind with
and inhibit the activity of CDK-cyclin complexes, thereby regulating
both G0-G1 and G2-M arrest transitions (32, 33).
To further characterize the cell cycle arrest, we examined the
level of expression of several known cyclins namely cyclin A2,
B2, estrone (E1), and E2 (Fig. 2B). Real-time PCR results showed
a down-regulation of all the cyclins that is consistent with
up-regulated expression levels of CDK inhibitors. A nonsignificant down-regulation was also observed for cyclin D1 and D3
(data not shown).
Methylation status of p16INK4a and p21WAF1 promoter. We
analyzed the status of promoter methylation for p16 and p21 in
prostate cancer and RWPE cell lines by bisulfite-modified PCR
followed by direct sequencing of the modified DNA samples. We
used MethPrimer software (34) to select primers in the CpG rich
region of the p21 and p16 promoters around the transcription start
sites. Primers were designed with no CpG sites in either the

forward or reverse primer and amplified a DNA fragment of the
promoter region containing a number of CpG sites (Fig. 3A). DNA
sequencing results revealed the absence of CpG island methylation
at the p21 promoter in both cell lines and the p16 promoter in
LNCaP cells. In DuPro cells, the p16 promoter was completely
methylated in untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Genistein (10 or 25 Amol/L)
treatment did not change the methylation status of these cells.
These results suggest that genistein induced mRNA expression of
the p16 and p21 genes by a methylation-independent mechanism.
In RWPE cells, absence of promoter methylation was found at both
the p21 and p16 promoters (Fig. 3B).
Changes in chromatin modifications. To determine whether
there were covalent chromatin changes after genistein treatment at
the p16INK4a and p21WAF1 locus, we did ChIP analysis with
various antibodies as described in Materials and Methods. The
expression levels were quantified by optical densitometry using
ImageJ Software version 1.36b. Enrichment was calculated as the
ratio between the net intensity of each bound sample divided by
the input and the vehicle control sample divided by the input
(bound/input)/(control/input).
Genistein treatment resulted in enrichment of acetylated
histones H3, H4, and H3 dimethylated at lysine 4 close to the
p16 and p21 transcription start sites in LNCaP, DuPro, and RWPE

cell lines (Fig. 4A–B). These changes are markers of active
modifications and indicative of gene activation. Therefore, the
increased levels of mRNA expression correlated with the enrichment of histone acetylation at the transcription start site in both
cell lines. Furthermore, we did not find any levels of repressive
modification—acetylated H3 dimethylated at lysine 9 in either cell
line before or after treatments.
Genistein up-regulates the expression of histone acetyltransferases. To further validate our ChIP analysis results, we
analyzed the expression of histone acetyltransferases [HAT; p300,
p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREBBP), and HAT1] that are involved in
transcriptional activation. Our results showed a significant increase
in the level of gene expression of these HATs in cells treated with
genistein compared with vehicle control (Fig. 5). These results
suggest that genistein up-regulates HATs that catalyze acetylation
of specific histone lysine residues that facilitates transcriptional
activation, but further functional studies need to be done to confirm the direct role of HATs in inducing chromatin remodeling.

Discussion
Genistein has been shown to induce differentiation and regulate
cancer cell growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. Various
mechanisms have been proposed for the action of genistein.
However, the novelty of our study is that it is the first report
showing epigenetic mechanism of the action of genistein through

chromatin remodeling of tumor suppressor genes in human prostate cancer cell lines.
Control of cell cycle progression in cancer cells is considered to be
a potentially effective strategy for the control of tumor growth as the
molecular analysis of human cancers have revealed that cell cycle
regulators are frequently mutated in most common malignancies
(35). Our in vitro data indicated that treatment of androgen-sensitive
(LNCaP) cells with genistein resulted in a significant G1 phase arrest
of cell cycle progression, which indicates that genistein may inhibit
cell cycle progression. We could not find any significant induction of
apoptosis in LNCaP cells after genistein treatment. Our findings of
decreased cyclin expression after genistein treatment suggest
disruption of the uncontrolled cell cycle progression of these cells
(Fig. 2B). Our results also indicate that genistein-induced G1 arrest is
mediated through the up-regulation of p21/CIP1 expression, which
enhances the formation of heterotrimetic complexes with the G1-S
CDKs and cyclins, thereby inhibiting their activity (Fig. 1). The CDK
inhibitors p21 and p27 are known to bind with and inhibit the
activity of CDK-cyclin complexes and, thus, regulate both G0-G1 and
G2-M arrest transitions (32, 33). Genistein has been reported to arrest
mouse fibroblast cells, melanoma cells (33), and prostate cancer
(LNCaP) cells (36) at the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Treatment of androgen-insensitive (DuPro) cells with genistein
resulted in significant G2-M phase arrest of cell cycle progression
and a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells at
25 Amol/L (Fig. 2A). Genistein has been found to induce G2-M cell
cycle arrest in breast, gastric, human melanoma (37, 38), PC3

prostate cancer (39), and lung cancer cells (40). Thus, it is generally
accepted that genistein can cause G2-M cell cycle arrest. Genistein
treatment of androgen-insensitive PC3 cells resulted in G2-M cell
cycle arrest and altered expression of two cell cycle regulatory
proteins, CDK inhibitor p21WAF1 and cyclin B1 (39). Our results
are consistent with these reports as there was a significant reduction in cyclin B1 with a concomitant increase in p21WAF1 expression (Figs. 1B and 2B). The cyclin B1/CDK1 complex is essential for
progression of cells through mitosis; therefore, a decrease in cyclin
B proteins can result in G2-M arrest (41).
Genistein has been reported to up-regulate mRNA expression of
BRCA1 gene during mammary tumorigenesis (2) and p16INK4a,
RARb , and MGMT genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
cell lines (28). Our study also showed that genistein dose dependently increased the mRNA and protein expression of tumor
suppressor genes p16 and p21 in both prostate cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1B–C). We further investigated the mechanism of this
induction through epigenetic pathways by examining the CpG
island methylation status of the p16 and p21 promoter. As shown
in Fig. 3, the DNA methylation analysis revealed absence of p21
promoter methylation in both cell lines without any genistein
treatment. However, p16 was completely methylated in DuPro cells
even after genistein treatment. The p21WAF1 promoter is
unmethylated in most types of human cancer (26). Induction of
p21WAF1 expression from an unmethylated p21 WAF1 promoter
has been reported in some human lung and colon cancer cell lines
(24, 25) and in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines when
treated with deacitabine (25). Furthermore, Shin (22) reported that
the promoter of the p21 gene was not methylated in gastric cancer
cells and confirmed that methylation was not the mechanism for
its inactivation. The promoter of the p16 gene has been found to be
unmethylated in LNCaP cells and completely methylated in DuPro
cells (42). Our results also showed the absence of p21 (LNCaP and
DuPro) and p16 (LNCaP) CpG island methylation, indicating that
methylation is not the mechanism involved in the induction of
gene expression by genistein in these cell lines. We further
investigated chromatin remodeling pathways as mechanisms of
genistein action in prostate cancer through ChIP analysis. Our
results showed that genistein treatment led to an increase in the
acetylation of histones H3, H4, and H3dimethK4 in a dose-

dependent manner (Fig. 4) around the transcription start site in
LNCaP, DuPro, and RWPE cell lines. We did not detect significant
levels of repressive histone modifications at the p16 or p21
promoter in either cell line. Our data suggest that induction of p16
and p21 gene expression is due to enrichment of active chromatin
modification rather than a loss of repressive histone modifications.
To further confirm our ChIP data, we examined the expression of
HAT, p300, CREBBP, PCAF, and HAT1 with Taq Man quantitative realtime PCR (Fig. 5). The results confirmed that genistein up-regulated
the expression of all the HATs and, thus, may catalyze the histone
acetylation that facilitated transcriptional activation. In this regard,
both histone hyperacetylation and hypoacetylation seem to be
important in carcinogenesis, and induction of gene expression
by histone hyperacetylation may be a mechanism by which dietary
fiber prevents carcinogenesis (43). The steady state of nucleosomal
histone acetylation is established by a dynamic equilibrium between
competing HAT and HDAC. In general, hyperacetylation of histone
lysine residues facilitates transcriptional activation, whereas deacetylation causes transcriptional silencing (44, 45). The recent discovery that a number of transcriptional activators have HAT activity
supports the idea that histone acetylation is correlated with transcriptional activation. In addition, increased core histone acetylation
is thought to correlate with stimulated transcription through HAT
activity of the co activators (46).
Our study shows that genistein can induce tumor suppressor genes
by an epigenetic mechanism that involves an increase in the active
chromatin modifications in a methylation independent pathway. To
our knowledge, this is the first report showing the effect of genistein
on chromatin remodeling in prostate cancer cell lines. It may
contribute to the chemopreventive activity of this dietary isoflavone.
