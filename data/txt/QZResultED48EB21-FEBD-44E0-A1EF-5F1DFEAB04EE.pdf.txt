Abstract
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most
aggressive and chemoresistant cancers. The serine/threonine
kinase Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key regulator of multiple
steps during mitotic progression, is highly expressed in ATC.
Here, we used the BI 2536 PLK1 inhibitor on ATC and
nontransformed thyroid follicular cell lines. Our data show
that ATC cells are addicted to high levels of PLK1 activity for
proliferation, survival, anchorage-independent growth, and
tumorigenicity. On treatment with nanomolar doses of BI
2536, ATC cells progressed normally through S phase but died
thereafter, directly from mitotic arrest. Immunofluorescence
microscopy, immunoblot, and flow cytometry analysis showed
that, on PLK1 blockade, ATC cells arrested in prometaphase
with a 4N DNA content. Treated ATC cells accumulated
phosphohistone H3 and displayed characteristic mitotic (Polo)
spindle aberrations. Nontransformed thyroid cells were 3.2- to
18.4-fold less susceptible to BI 2536–induced cell cycle effects
compared with ATC cells. These findings identify PLK1 as a
promising target for the molecular therapy of ATC. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a rare
thyroid cancer (2–5% of all cases), ranks among the most lethal
human malignancies with a mortality rate above 90% and median
survival from diagnosis of approximately 4 to 12 months (1–3).
ATC usually presents during the 6th to 7th decade of life as a
rapidly enlarging neck mass that extends locally, compresses the
adjacent structures, and tends to disseminate to regional nodes
and distant sites (1–3). Multimodal therapy, including surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, does not change the natural
course of the disease (1–3).
Several genetic alterations involved in the pathogenesis of ATC
are known. Some of them, namely, point mutations in RAS and
BRAF (4–8) and point mutations or gene amplification of PIK3CA
(9, 10), are found not only in ATC but also in well-differentiated
(papillary or follicular) carcinomas, suggesting that ATC may
develop secondary to neoplastic progression of well-differentiated
thyroid cancers. Conversely, p53 mutations are rarely seen in welldifferentiated lesions (<10%), whereas they occur in 67% to 88% of

ATC (4, 5). Other mechanisms, besides gene mutation, may
functionally impair p53 in ATC (11, 12).
We have recently identified a gene expression signature
associated with ATC phenotype, featuring up-regulation of Pololike kinase 1 (PLK1; ref. 13). PLK1 belongs to the Polo family
of serine/threonine kinases, which also includes PLK2, PLK3,
and PLK4 (14). PLK1 plays a pivotal role in several G2- and
M-phase–related events, namely, centrosome maturation,
a-tubulin association with centrosomes and microtubule nucleation, bipolar spindle formation, CDC2 (CDK1)-cyclin B activation,
anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activation (by
direct APC phosphorylation and by inactivation of the APC/C
inhibitor Emi1), chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (14–17).
Consistent with its prominent role in G2-M phase, PLK1 expression
and activity are low throughout G0, G1, and S phase and then rise
in G2 and peak during M phase (15).
PLK1 is overexpressed in several cancer types and its upregulation often correlates with poor prognosis (14–16). Adoptive
overexpression of PLK1 causes cell transformation, whereas its
depletion/inactivation leads to mitotic arrest and cell death
(18–21). Therefore, PLK1 has been envisaged as a potential target
in cancer therapy (17, 22–28).
BI 2536 is a dihydropteridinone compound that inhibits PLK1
activity in an ATP-competitive manner (17, 22). BI 2536 inhibited
PLK1 with high potency (IC50, 0.83 nmol/L); it showed a z10,000fold selectivity relative to a panel of 63 other protein kinases and
equipotently blocked human, rat, and mouse PLK1 (22). Here, we
show that BI 2536 selectively induces prometaphase arrest and
mitotic death of ATC cells, suggesting that targeting PLK1 could be
pursued as a novel strategy in the treatment of ATC.

Materials and Methods
Compound. BI 2536, 4-((R)-8-cyclopentyl-7-ethyl-5-methyl-6-oxo-5,6,7,8tetrahydro-pteridin-2-ylamino)-3-methoxy-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-benzamide, was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim Austria GmbH. BI 2536 was
dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mmol/L and stored at 80jC.
Vehicle alone was used as a control.
Cell cultures. The human ATC cell lines CAL62 (29), SW1736 (30), OCUT-1
(31), 8505C (32), and ACT-1 (33) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CAL62 and 8505C were purchased from
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. OCUT-1
and ACT-1 were a gift of K. Hirakawa and N. Onoda (Department of Surgical
Oncology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan)
and SW1736 cells were a gift of C.H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer
Research, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden). The Fischer rat-derived
untransformed thyroid follicular cell line PC Cl 3 (hereafter ‘‘PC’’) was grown
in Coon’s modified Ham F12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and
a mixture of six hormones, including thyrotropin (10 milliunits/mL),
hydrocortisone (10 nmol/L), insulin (10 Ag/mL), apo-transferrin (5 Ag/mL),
somatostatin (10 ng/mL), and glycyl-histidyl-lysine (10 ng/mL; Sigma-

Aldrich). Normal human thyrocytes were isolated from normal thyroid tissue
obtained from a patient who underwent thyroid surgery and cultivated in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cell proliferation and
soft agar colony formation assays were performed according to standard
procedures as described in Supplementary Data.
Protein studies. Immunoblotting experiments were performed according
to standard procedures (Supplementary Data). A list of the antibodies is
available in Supplementary Data.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence experiments were
performed according to standard procedures (Supplementary Data).
In vitro PLK1 kinase assays. The in vitro PLK1 kinase assay was
performed as previously described (34). Briefly, exponentially growing cells
were solubilized in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% NP40,
120 mmol/L NaCl] containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were
then incubated with anti-PLK1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose
beads and incubated in the presence of 5 ACi [g-32P]ATP at 30jC for 10 min
with 10 Ag of a-casein (Sigma) in 20 AL of PLK1 kinase buffer [20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 Amol/L ATP]. The reactions were stopped by adding
20 AL of 2 Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels
were dried and visualized by autoradiography or transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by Western blot. Signal intensity was analyzed at the
Phosphorimager (Typhoon 8600, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) interfaced
with the ImageQuant software.
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle experiments were performed according to
standard flow cytometry procedures. A description is available in
Supplementary Data.
Animal studies. CAL62 cells (2  107 per mouse) were inoculated s.c. into
the flank of 6-wk-old female CD1 nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories
Italia). When tumors reached a volume of f50 mm3, animals were
randomized into treatment and control groups of seven mice each. BI 2536
was dissolved in 0.1 N HCl, diluted with 0.9% NaCl, and injected i.v. into the tail
vein. The administration volume was 10 mL/kg body weight. Animal studies
were conducted according to the Italian regulation for the experimentations
on animals. More details are available in Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis. The two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used
for statistical analysis. All P values were two sided and differences were
significant when P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were carried out using the
GraphPad InStat software program (version 3.06.3).

Results
BI 2536–mediated PLK1 inhibition reduces growth and
viability of ATC cells. We used ATC cell lines CAL62, SW1736,
OCUT-1, 8505C, and ACT-1. These cells overexpress PLK1 (data not
shown; ref. 13) and have varied patterns of chromosome
aberrations and oncogene mutations (30): SW1736, OCUT-1, and
8505C harbor the BRAF V600E mutation (32), whereas CAL624 and
ACT-15 cells exhibit the KRAS G12R and the NRAS Q61K mutations,
respectively. All the ATC cells have p53 gene alterations: 8505C,
CAL62,4 and ACT-15 have p53 gene mutations; SW1736 and
OCUT-1 are negative for p53 expression (13, 31).
To verify whether PLK1 overexpression in aggressive thyroid
carcinoma cells was paralleled by an increase in its activity, PLK1
protein was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of protein
lysates obtained from exponentially growing CAL62 and SW1736
cells and from a normal thyroid primary culture; precipitates were
subjected to in vitro kinase assay using a-casein as a substrate. As

shown in Fig. 1A, higher (>10-fold) PLK1 activity was detected in
ATC cells compared with normal thyrocytes.
Next, we tested the effect of PLK1 inactivation on ATC cell
growth and viability. Cells were treated with BI 2536 over a 1,000fold concentration range (starting at 0.1 nmol/L) and counted
every day. Vehicle alone was used as a control. Figure 1B shows
the average result of three independent experiments. BI 2536
treatment caused a significant (P < 0.0001) growth impairment of
the cancer cell lines. At 72 hours of treatment, EC50s were 1.4, 2.3,
3.2, 5.4, and 5.6 nmol/L for CAL62, OCUT-1, SW1736, 8505C, and
ACT-1 cells, respectively. Cell growth impairment was most likely
the result of both growth arrest (due to G2-M–phase stall, see
below) and reduced cell viability. Compared with vehicle control,
after 72 hours of treatment with 10 nmol/L BI 2536, a reduced
fraction of viable ATC cells (16.7%, 59.1%, 66.4%, 68.8%, and 75.6%
for CAL62, OCUT-1, 8505C, ACT-1, and SW1736, respectively) was
detected by trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1C). To analyze BI
2536 effects on nontransformed cycling thyroid cells, we used
normal thyroid primary culture cells and thyroid follicular PC
cells. BI 2536 showed an EC50 value for the growth of normal
thyroid (25.8 nmol/L) and PC cells (17.8 nmol/L) that was,
respectively, 4.6 to 18.4-fold and 3.3- to 13-fold higher compared
with ATC cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B). In line with this, 72 hours of
treatment with 10 nmol/L BI 2536 failed to produce any significant
reduction in the proportion of viable normal thyroid cells (Fig. 1C).
At in vitro kinase assays, levels of PLK1 inhibition in untransformed PC and in normal thyroid cells were, respectively, similar
to or higher than those of CAL62 cells. At the 1 nmol/L
submaximal inhibitory BI 2536 concentration, residual PLK1
activity was 48.5% in CAL62, 52.6% in PC, and 28.1% in normal
thyroid cells. This excluded a difference in PLK1 inhibitory
potency as the cause for the different susceptibility to the
compound of ATC versus nontransformed cells (Fig. 1D).
PLK1 protein level and kinase activity rise in G2 and peak during
M phase, and PLK1 is involved in regulating these phases (14–17).
In keeping with this, the dramatic effects resulting from PLK1
depletion/inhibition occur during mitosis (19–21) when its activity
is most required. Indeed, among the cell lines tested, normal
thyroid primary culture cells were both the less sensitive to BI 2536
and the slowest growing ones (0.87 population doublings in 72
hours; Fig. 1B), suggesting a correlation between growth rate and
susceptibility to PLK1 inhibition. However, this did not apply to all
cell lines. In fact, despite showing lower PLK1 expression (13) and
activity (Fig. 1D, inset), nontransformed PC (3.2 population
doublings in 72 hours) displayed a growth rate that was
comparable with that of ATC ( from 1.2 to 3.7 population doublings
in 72 hours) cells (Fig. 1B); this suggests that factors other than
proliferation rate may influence susceptibility to PLK1 inhibition.
Albeit with lower potency with respect to PLK1 (IC50, 0.83 nmol/L),
BI 2536 is known to inhibit PLK2 (IC50, 3.5 nmol/L) and PLK3 (IC50,
9.0 nmol/L) as well (17, 22). This prompted us to consider that,
regardless of the low nanomolar concentrations used in our
experiments, effects on these two kinases might contribute to the
different sensitivity of the cells to the compound. Such possibility
was ruled out by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments, showing only mild differences in PLK2 and PLK3 expression
between the different cells and no correlation with their sensitivity
to BI 2536 (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and by small interfering RNA
(siRNA) experiments in which only silencing of PLK1, but not PLK2
or PLK3, was able to cause a significant (P < 0.0001) growth
impairment of CAL62 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).

BI 2536 inhibits ATC cell anchorage-independent
proliferation and tumor growth. We tested whether BI 2536
inhibited the ability of CAL62 cells to proliferate in vitro in
semisolid medium and in vivo in mice xenografts. BI 2536
(5 nmol/L) abrogated almost completely CAL62 colony formation
in soft agar (>76-fold compared with vehicle control) as shown
in Fig. 2A. For animal studies, BI 2536 or vehicle was
administered i.v. to immunodeficient nu/nu mice that had
developed CAL62 xenograft tumors of f50 mm3 volume. As
shown in Fig. 2B, after two cycles of 50 mg/kg BI 2536 given twice
weekly, treated mice had significantly smaller tumors compared

BI 2536 induces prometaphase arrest and mitotic death of

viability reduction on BI 2536 treatment, exponentially growing ATC
cells were treated with BI 2536 at the lowest effective concentration
(as estimated by the cell growth assays in Fig. 1) and cell cycle profile
was analyzed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy,
and immunoblot. Vehicle was used as a negative control. As shown
in Fig. 3A, starting at 12 hours of treatment, 5 nmol/L (CAL62) and

the 4N DNA fraction in ATC cells. This was followed at 36 and 48
hours by the appearance of a sub-G1 peak. At 48 hours, sub-G1
fractions in BI 2536–treated compared with vehicle-treated cells
were 20% versus 0.67% for CAL62, 16.72% versus 1.26% for 8505C,
14.8% versus 2.2% for ACT-1, 12% versus 2.31% for OCUT-1, and
6.15% versus 1.7% for SW1736. Cell fractions with a >4N DNA peak
were hardly detectable, indicating that the treatment did not cause
reduplication of unseparated sister chromatids after failure of
cytokinesis (see also below; Fig. 3A). The presence of a residual 2N
DNA fraction in some BI 2536–treated ATC cell lines was attributed
to their slower doubling time (Fig. 1B) rather than G1- or S-phase
arrest (see also below). None of the aforementioned effects could be
seen in PC cells on incubation with 10 nmol/L BI 2536 (Fig. 3A). In

these cells, only treatment with z50 nmol/L concentrations of the
compound gave results similar to those observed in ATC cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The accumulation of cells with a 4N DNA content is indicative of
a cell cycle block in either G2 or M phase. To distinguish between
the two possibilities, BI 2536–treated or DMSO-treated cells were
either stained with anti-phosphohistone H3 by immunofluorescence or analyzed by immunoblot for cyclin B1 levels. PLK1 protein
levels were also examined as surrogate G2-M phase marker.
The percentage of mitotic (phosphohistone H3 positive) cells
was increased in BI 2536–treated ATC, but not PC cells, as soon as
12 hours after treatment, peaking at 24 hours and decreasing
thereafter (Fig. 3B). Both cyclin B1 and PLK1 protein levels
underwent analogous changes on BI 2536 treatment, with a peak at
24 or 36 hours and a decline at 24 to 36 hours or 36 to 48 hours
depending on the cell line (Fig. 3C). These findings indicated that
the compound caused M-phase arrest of ATC cells. Concentrations
z50 nmol/L were required to elicit similar responses in PC cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B and C).
The reduction of phosphohistone H3–positive cells and cyclin B1
levels at the most onward time points could be due to death of
ATC cells directly from mitosis; alternatively, on the 4N block, cells
may attempt to start a novel cycle and reduplicate their genome.
As mentioned above, this second hypothesis could be ruled out
given the absence of >4N DNA peaks at flow cytometry. On
the other hand, caspase-3 cleavage fragments appeared in ATC
cell lines treated with BI 2536 before or at mitosis exit (cyclin B1
degradation; Fig. 3C). In the highly proliferative CAL62 cells
(3.7 population doublings in 72 hours; Fig. 1B), which displayed a
major reduction of cyclin B1 levels after 36 hours of treatment,
cleaved caspase-3 fragments were detectable as soon as 24 hours
after incubation with BI 2536 and peaked at 36 hours. At the other
end of the spectrum, in the less rapidly growing SW1736 cells (1.14
population doublings in 72 hours; Fig. 1B), which showed more
modest reduction of cyclin B1 after 36 hours of treatment, caspase3 fragments showed a milder and delayed increase. Taken together,
these findings suggest that, on PLK1 inhibition, ATC cells rapidly
undergo a deadly faith directly from mitosis and that, among
different ATC cells, those with the highest proliferative rate tend to
be the most susceptible to PLK1 inhibition.
To further characterize the cell cycle effects of PLK1 inhibition, we
synchronized CAL62 cells at the G1-S transition by double thymidine
block; cells were released in the presence of 5 nmol/L BI 2536 or
vehicle and analyzed by flow cytometry and immunoblot at different
time points. As shown in Fig. 4A, BI 2536–treated cells progressed
normally through S phase and then arrested in G2-M (at 11 hours).
Sub-G1 DNA fractions became detectable after 29 to 48 hours from
release (Fig. 4A). Instead, cells released in control medium normally
progressed through S and G2-M and then reentered a new G1 phase
(Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis showed consistent results. In vehicletreated cells, cyclin B1 was down-regulated after 24 hours from
release as cells had exited mitosis (Fig. 4B), whereas in cells treated
with BI 2536, cyclin B1 down-regulation was delayed until 35 hours
(Fig. 4B). In treated cells, cleaved caspase-3 fragments were clearly
detectable after 24 hours of treatment, again suggesting that cell
death may occur directly from mitosis. Moreover, despite a reduction
of cyclin B1 levels at the latest time points, BI 2536–treated cells
failed to down-regulate geminin (Fig. 4B), an event that is required to
start a new DNA duplication cycle (35). This indicates that treated
cells remained unlicensed for replication, ruling out the possibility of
reduplication of undivided cells.

Figure 3. Cell cycle effects of BI 2536 in ATC cells. A, the indicated cell
lines were treated with 5 nmol/L (CAL62) and 10 nmol/L (8505C, ACT-1,
OCUT-1, SW1736, and PC) of BI 2536 or vehicle (NT) and DNA content was
analyzed by flow cytometry at different time points. B, CAL62 and SW1736
ATC cells or control PC cells, grown on glass coverslips, were treated
with BI 2536. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed, stained with
anti-phosphohistone H3 (p-H3 ; Ser10) and analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy. The percentage of positive cells represents the average of
three experiments in which at least 500 cells were counted. Insets,
representative micrographs. C, CAL62 and SW1736 cells, treated with
BI 2536 or vehicle (NT), were lysed at the indicated time points and subjected
to immunoblot with anti-cyclin B1 (cycB1 ) and anti-PLK1 and
anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies (which detect only the p17 and p19
cleaved caspase-3 fragments). Tubulin levels are shown for normalization.
Data are representative of at least three different experiments.

BI 2536 induces characteristic mitotic spindle aberrations
in ATC cells. Depletion or inactivation of PLK1 has been reported to
induce characteristic mitotic spindle aberrations in several cancer
cells (14–17, 19, 21, 22, 24). To further prove that BI 2536 effects in
ATC cells were mediated by PLK1 inhibition, we asked whether
compound treatment phenocopied PLK1 knockdown (13). Exponentially growing CAL62 and SW1736 cells were treated with BI 2536
(5 and 10 nmol/L, respectively), collected at different time intervals,
and stained for immunofluorescence with anti-a-tubulin to visualize
mitotic spindle and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize DNA. Consistent with the results obtained by anti-phosphohi-

stone H3 staining, both ATC cell lines showed an accumulation of
mitotic cells in a prometaphase state starting at 12 hours and
peaking at 24 hours; in treated cells, anaphase and cytokinesis figures
were virtually absent (Fig. 5A). No increase in the mitotic fraction
could be seen in control PC cells on treatment with 10 nmol/L BI
2536, and all the mitotic phases were normally represented (Fig. 5A).
A characteristic phenotype in inhibitor-treated ATC cells, but not
PC cells, was the presence of aberrant monopolar (Polo) spindles, a
hallmark of PLK1 depletion/inactivation (Fig. 5A). Such Polo
spindles are monoastral microtubule arrays nucleated from a single
organizing center and containing unseparated centrosomes circled

by a ring of condensed chromosomes (15). Monopolar spindles seem
to occur secondary to a defect in timely organization of microtubule
asters at prophase followed by the instantaneous polymerization of
mitotic microtubules in a monopolar aster only after nuclear
envelope breakdown (17). They occurred in BI 2536–treated ATC
cells along with other aberrant spindle phenotypes, such as
multipolar spindles and spindles without a clear spatial organization
(disorganized) that accumulated with time (Fig. 5A and B). After
36 hours of treatment, albeit only very few mitotic cells could be seen
on coverslips, virtually 100% of them had an abnormal spindle.
Moreover, after 36 and 48 hours of treatment, in parallel with the
reduction of phosphohistone H3–positive cells and cyclin B1 levels
and with increased levels of caspase-3 fragments, most of the
remaining ATC cells either showed an apoptotic nuclear morphology

or harbored decondensed/partially condensed nuclei with gross
morphologic aberrations (Fig. 5A). These are hallmarks of the socalled mitotic catastrophe, a form of cell death taking place from
within mitosis and resulting in either apoptosis or necrosis (36). In
nontransformed cells, a similar effect could only be obtained with
compound doses z50 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2D).

Discussion
Targeting key components of the mitotic machinery has been
envisaged as a possible strategy in cancer treatment. Among them,
PLK1 has emerged as a promising candidate (15, 16). PLK1
depletion/inhibition reduces survival of several cancer cells and
inhibits tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models (19–27). It

is feasible that, based on the specific role of PLK1 in mitosis,
its inhibition may avoid some of the side effects associated
with current antimitotic agents (such as taxanes and Vinca alkaloid
derivatives) that, by targeting microtubules, affect many critical
cellular processes (e.g., axonal transport) unrelated to mitosis (15, 16).
Here, we took advantage of the high potency and selectivity of BI
2536, a compound able to inhibit PLK1 activity at low nanomolar
concentrations, to exploit PLK1 requirement of ATC cells.
ATC cells displayed high PLK1 activity and addiction to high
concentrations of functional PLK1 for faithful bipolar spindle
assembly and mitosis, being dependent on PLK1 for proliferation,
survival, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor development.
Concentrations as low as 5 to 10 nmol/L of BI 2536 were sufficient
to inhibit PLK1 and cause prometaphase arrest with characteristic
spindle aberrations. This caused mitotic entrapment and subsequent mitotic cell death, a process resulting from aberrant mitosis
and that can occur through necrosis or apoptosis (36).
These effects are hallmarks of PLK1 inhibition, suggesting that the
compound is exerting its effects in ATC cells by blocking PLK1 and
not other targets (15–17). Besides inhibiting PLK1, BI 2536 also
affects the activities of PLK2 and PLK3, albeit at higher concentrations (17, 22). However, PLK2 and PLK3 expression levels did not
correlate with ATC cell sensitivity to BI 2536, and PLK2 and PLK3
depletion failed to reduce ATC cell growth, excluding any

contribution of these two kinases to BI 2536–induced growth and
viability impairment in ATC cells. Moreover, PLK2 and PLK3 are
thought to function in G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, which
were not significantly affected by BI 2536 treatment of ATC cells.
Interestingly, polyploidy, a major concern when targeting kinases
involved in mitosis/cytokinesis as it may promote tumorigenesis (16,
37), was not detected, and the possibility of reduplication was ruled
out. Instead, this potentially harmful phenomenon was reported
with Aurora B inhibitors that silenced the mitotic spindle
checkpoint, causing precocious mitotic exit and polyploidy (16).
Importantly, untransformed thyrocytes proved to be less
sensitive to BI 2536, suggesting the possibility of achieving a
therapeutic window in vivo. In fact, the threshold of PLK1 activity
to sustain a normal mitotic cycle was lower in nontransformed
cells, where proliferation and viability impairment was observed
only at high doses of BI 2536. Although in the case of primary
human normal thyroid cells this was clearly correlated to reduced
proliferation rate, this was not the case for nontransformed PC
thyroid follicular cells. Beyond the influence of growth rate, the
reason for the different PLK1 requirement between normal and
cancer cells remains unknown. Several reports have indicated that
the p53 status may be a genetic determinant of susceptibility to
PLK1 inhibition: p53 protein is stabilized in PLK1-depleted cancer
cells (20, 21) and p53 depletion enhances the sensitivity of various

cell types to PLK1 knockdown (21, 38). Along this line, all the ATC
cell lines used in this study either harbor p53 gene mutations or are
negative for wild-type p53 expression. Intriguingly, OCUT-1 and
SW1736 cells that do not express p53 showed a milder increase in
cleaved caspase-3 levels on PLK1 inhibition compared with the
other ATC cells that instead harbor a mutant p53 protein.
Moreover, we observed that growth of PC cells stably expressing
a V143A dominant-negative p53 was significantly (P < 0.001)
compromised by 72 hours of BI 2536 (10 nmol/L) treatment or
48 hours of siRNA-mediated PLK1 depletion (>3- and 16.5-fold,
respectively) compared with native PC cells (which harbor wildtype p53; Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, one possibility is that p53
function may be required to survive PLK1 depletion and the
frequent impairment of p53 would make ATC cells particularly
susceptible to PLK1 inhibition.
Whatever the mechanism, our findings suggest that PLK1 might
be exploited as a molecular target in ATC therapy and BI 2536,
which has already progressed into phase I clinical trials in patients
with advanced solid tumors (28), or other specific PLK1 inhibitors
