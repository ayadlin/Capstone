Abstract
Transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) functions as a tumor
suppressor of the prostate through mechanisms that remain
unresolved. Although TGF-B receptors directly activate both
Smads 2 and 3, to date, Smad3 has been shown to be the
essential mediator of most Smad-dependent TGF-B responses,
including control of gene expression, cell growth, apoptosis,
and tumor suppression. Using a robust lentiviral short hairpin
RNA system to silence Smads 2 and/or 3 in the NRP-152
nontumorigenic rat prostate basal epithelial cell line,
we provide the first evidence for Smad2 as a critical
mediator of TGF-B–induced apoptosis and gene expression.
Parallel analyses revealed that Smad3 is the major mediator
of TGF-B–induced transcriptional and apoptotic responses in
the NRP-154 rat prostate carcinoma cell line. Remarkably,
silencing Smad2 alone caused malignant transformation of
NRP-152 cells, as assayed by s.c. tumor growth in athymic
mice, whereas silencing Smad3 alone did not induce tumors.
Nevertheless, tumors induced by silencing both Smads 2 and 3
were larger than those from silencing Smad2 alone. Given
previous reports that NRP-152 cells have a stem cell
phenotype, we speculate a critical role for Smad2 as a tumor
suppressor in the basal epithelial or stem cell compartment of
the prostate. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2185–90]

Introduction

microarray study with Smad2 or Smad3 knockout (KO) mouse
embryonic fibroblasts reported that Smad3 was essential for the
regulation of immediate-early target genes of TGF-h, whereas
Smad2 only transmodulated Smad3-dependent transcription (4).
Finally, Smad3, but not Smad2, was shown to be required for the
induction of apoptosis/growth inhibition elicited by TGF-h in
various keratinocytes and epithelial cells (5).
Despite the crucial roles of Smad3 in TGF-h signaling, Smad3
mutations are detected at extremely low frequency in cancer (6),
whereas mutations in and/or protein loss of Smad2 have been
reported to be far more common (7). Although several earlier
publications noted that Smad2 loss/mutation occurs rarely in
prostate cancer (8, 9), a recent report found that phospho-Smad2
levels are significantly reduced in prostate tumors (10), suggesting
that Smad2 is inactivated during prostate carcinogenesis. Moreover, although Smad3 KO mice are viable, Smad2 KO mouse
embryos are not viable, indicating an indispensable role for Smad2
in development (5). Overall, these findings implicate important
roles for Smad2 in tissue homeostasis during development and
tumorigenesis.
Danielpour and colleagues (11) have previously derived two
spontaneously immortalized cell lines (NRP-152 and NRP-154)
from the preneoplastic prostate of the Lobund-Wistar rat, and both
cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to TGF-h–induced apoptosis (12).
NRP-154 has a luminal epithelial phenotype and forms tumors
when implanted s.c. in athymic mice, whereas NRP-152 is a
nontumorigenic basal epithelial cell line that undergoes malignant
transformation after suppression of TGF-h signaling by retroviral
transduction of dominant-negative (DN) ThRII (11, 13). Interestingly, NRP-152 has stem cell–like properties, and possesses the
unique ability to form morphologically normal prostate ductal
structures under the renal capsule of athymic mice when
recombined with normal urogenital sinus mesenchyme (14, 15).
In the current study, we explored the roles of endogenous Smad2
and Smad3 in TGF-h–mediated apoptosis, gene expression, and
tumor suppression of NRP-152 cells, and compared those responses
in NRP-154 cells. Here, we report the first evidence that Smad2 can
function as a tumor suppressor and a critical mediator of TGF-h
responses in prostate epithelial cells.

Transforming growth factor h (TGF-h) functions as a candidate
tumor suppressor of the prostate, likely through its robust
cytostatic effects (1). TGF-h signals through engaging TGF-h
receptors type II (ThRII) and type I (ThRI) to form a tetrameric
receptor complex, leading to activation of ThRI. ThRI, in turn,
phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, causing their homo-oligomerization and oligomerization with Smad4, which together translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription (2). ThRI can also
directly activate other intracellular signaling effectors (3).
Studies reported thus far have portrayed a critical role of
Smad3, but not of Smad2, in TGF-h–induced apoptosis and
transcriptional control. First, Smad3 (and also Smad4) binds to
Smad-binding elements (SBE), whereas the common splice form
of Smad2 does not bind DNA (2). Second, a gene expression

lentivirus production and Smad silencing were described earlier (16).
Lentivirus-mediated stable gene silencing. The production of shRNAexpression lentiviruses were previously described (16). For transduction and
establishment of stable gene silencing, multiplicity of infection of 50 of
lentiviruses harboring shRNA-LacZ, shRNA-Smad2, and/or shRNA-Smad3
were used for NRP-152 cells (to derive NRP-152-shRNA cells). NRP-154-tTRshRNA cells were derived as described previously (16).
Western blot. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot
as described previously (16).
Luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transfected, treated, and assayed
similarly as before (16). For each well, 0.2 Ag of individual luciferase reporter
vector, 20 ng of cytomegalovirus-renilla, and 0.8 Ag of pcDNA3 were used.
Cell number assay. Control or Smad-ablated NRP-152 and NRP-154 cells,
after various treatments, were washed with PBS and detached by TrypsinEDTA solution. Cell number was enumerated using a Coulter Counter.

Flow cytometry. For cell cycle analysis, cells (1.5  106) were detached
from plates, washed once in PBS, and then fixed in 90% methanol. After
treatment with 0.1 mg/mL of RNase A, cells were incubated with 50 Ag/mL
of propidium iodide and then analyzed with an EPICS-XL MCL flow
cytometer. Sub-G1 cells, which have less than 2n DNA content, are
considered apoptotic.
In vivo tumorigenicity studies. Six- to seven-week-old intact male
athymic nude (NCr:NU) mice were injected s.c. on opposing flanks with
0.1 mL of the cell suspension (2  106 cells) in DMEM/F12/Matrigel
(1:1, v/v). Mice tumor volume (length  width2  0.5) was assessed weekly
with the use of fine calipers. Excised tumors were fixed in formalin,
embedded in paraffin, and stained H&E.

Results and Discussion
Lentivirus-mediated Smad silencing. We used NRP-152
(basal) and NRP-154 (luminal) rat prostate epithelial cell lines
to define the role of Smads 2 and 3 in TGF-h signaling in prostate

Figure 1. Smad2 is essential for TGF-h–induced apoptosis of NRP-152 basal epithelial cells, whereas Smad3 is the major mediator of such process in NRP-154
luminal epithelial cells. A, Smads 2 and 3 were effectively silenced individually or in combination, as exemplified at the protein levels in NRP-152 cells. Note that
Smad3 antibody recognizes both Smad2 and Smad3 (arrows ). B, NRP-152-shRNA cells or NRP-154- tTR-shRNA cells incubated with Doxy were treated with
10 ng/mL TGF-h1 or vehicle for 72 or 48 h, respectively, and the attached cells were counted using a Coulter counter as the viable cells. % Viable cells represents
the percentage of viable cells after TGF-h treatment and was calculated from three independent experiments. C and D, cells were plated and treated as in B .
Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis of sub-G1 population (C, as % sub-G1 and plotted in a bar graph format), or an antibody detecting the active
form of caspase-3 (casp-3 ; D ).

the parentheses.

The relative dependence on Smad2 and Smad3 for apoptotic
responses initiated by TGF-B. We first explored whether
silencing either or both of the TGF-h receptor Smads (R-Smads)
would inhibit TGF-h–induced apoptosis in NRP-152 and NRP-154
cells. NRP-152-shRNA and NRP-154-shRNA cells were treated with
vehicle or TGF-h for 72 or 48 hours, respectively. The percentage
of viable cells after TGF-h treatment was determined in the above

silenced cells. We observed that sh-Smad2 substantially blocked
TGF-h–induced death of NRP-152 cells, in contrast to a minimal
effect on viability of NRP-154 cells (Fig. 1B). In the latter cell line,
sh-Smad3 significantly reduced cell death initiated by TGF-h,
whereas Smad2 silencing was effective in suppressing such cell
death only when cosilenced with Smad3 (Fig. 1B). Similar
patterns were observed with other indicators of apoptosis such
as sub-G1 population (Fig. 1C) and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1D).
The basis for such differential dependence on R-Smads for
TGF-h–mediated apoptosis in these two cell lines, according to
our preliminary data, could be related to their distinct differentiation states. NRP-154 cells are tumorigenic luminal epithelial
cells, and the observation that Smad3 is their major apoptosis
mediator for TGF-h is reminiscent of previous studies in
keratinocytes and several cancer cell lines (5). In addition, a report
by Kim and colleagues (18) revealed opposite effects of Smad2 and
Smad3 in the cytostatic responses of TGF-h in an array of tumor
cells. Instead, we observed a cooperative effect of these R-Smads in
both NRP-154 and NRP-152 cells (Fig. 1). More interestingly,
silencing Smad2 alone in NRP-152 cells, which have stem cell–like
properties (15), robustly inhibited apoptosis by TGF-h (Fig. 1). This
finding by itself is quite novel and could represent a more general
mechanism used by TGF-h to induce apoptosis in undifferentiated,
stem cell–like, pluripotent or basal cells.
Smad2 is critical to transcriptional activation by TGF-B in
NRP-152 cells. We next examined whether Smad2 was also
required for transcriptional responses by TGF-h in NRP-152 cells.

Smad2 as a Putative Tumor Suppressor of the Prostate

To this end, we used the plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter
construct (3TP-Lux) and several basic response-element reporters
[SBE4 luciferase, AP-1 luciferase, and nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
luciferase]. Interestingly, silencing Smad2 abrogated most of the
TGF-h–induced promoter activities in NRP-152 cells (Fig. 2A),
unlike NRP-154 cells in which silencing Smad3 alone suppressed
most of those responses (Fig. 2B). In NRP-152 cells, silencing
Smad2 alone substantially suppressed the basal activity of all four
promoters, consistent with our previous report that NRP-152
produce active autocrine TGF-h (15). Collectively, our data indicate
that Smad2 in NRP-152 cells and Smad3 in NRP-154 cells are the
major mediators of transcriptional responses by TGF-h. The
mechanism by which Smad2 or Smad3 mediate TGF-h–induced
transcriptional activation of the AP-1 and NF-nB response
elements is likely to be indirect as they lack SBEs.
Smad2 functions as a tumor suppressor in NRP-152 cells.
Previous work showed that retroviral transduction of DN-ThRII,
which blocks TGF-h–induced cell death, caused malignant
transformation of NPR-152 prostate basal epithelial cells (13).
Because Smad2 is critical for TGF-h–mediated cellular responses
in NRP-152 cells, and TGF-h functions as a tumor suppressor of
those cells (13), we hypothesized that Smad2 is a tumor suppressor
in NRP-152 cells. To test this hypothesis, NRP-152-sh-LacZ, -shSmad2, -sh-Smad3, or -sh-Smad2+3 cell pools were individually
inoculated s.c. above both hind flanks of male athymic mice, using
10 mice per group. Mice injected with sh-Smad2 or sh-Smad2+3
cells formed palpable lesions by 4 weeks, whereas no lesions were
detectable even up to 4 months in mice receiving the sh-LacZ or
sh-Smad3 cells. By day 41, 15 of 18 injection sites (83%) in the
sh-Smad2 group developed tumors (Table 1). Although silencing
Smad3 alone did not cause tumors, it enhanced tumor incidence to
94% and significantly increased tumor size when concomitantly
silenced with Smad2 (Table 1; Fig. 3A). By day 53, both sh-Smad2
and sh-Smad2+3 groups progressed to 100% tumor incidence
(Table 1) and had larger tumor burden (Fig. 3C). The kinetics of
tumor volume (Fig. 3A) as well as the tumor weight (Fig. 3B)
showed rapid growth of both sh-Smad2 and sh-Smad2+3 tumors,
with greater growth rate in the latter group (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A).
These results support that Smad2 but not Smad3 functions as a
tumor suppressor in NRP-152 cells, although loss of Smad3
enhanced tumor growth and incidence in the Smad2 deficient cells.
Histologically, tumors in sh-Smad2 and sh-Smad2+3 groups had
similar features, containing cells with large pleiomorphic nuclei
and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3D). Clusters of adenocarcinoma cells
were frequently observed, often with a necrotic centers, and there
were significant areas of squamous carcinoma (Fig. 3D). Overall,
the sh-Smad2+3 tumors were less desmoplastic and more glandular
than sh-Smad2 tumors. In general, tumors in both groups have
features typical of those generated from NRP-152 expressing DNThRII (13).
The above results suggest that Smad2 functions as a tumor
suppressor of prostate epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the
first report demonstrating critical roles of Smad2 in various TGF-h
responses including apoptosis, and the first report that directly

links loss of Smad2 to tumorigenesis. A previous study using a
Smad3 COOH-terminal deletion construct, which reduces the
phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3, speculated a role for
both of these Smads in tumor suppression of breast epithelial cells
(19). Another report suggesting a tumor suppressive function of
Smad2 was shown in a conditional KO mouse model in which KO
of Smad2 enhanced the onset, incidence and stage of chemically
induced skin tumors (20). It is likely that other reports overlooked
the relative importance of Smad2 in the cytostatic responses of
TGF-h owing to limitations in the types of cell lines used (i.e.,
tumorigenic, differentiated cells).
The derivation of NRP-152 cells from a preneoplastic prostate,
their nontumorigenic phenotype (11), their stem cell–like features
(15), and their ability to reconstitute a functional prostate
epithelium in vivo (14) make them an ideal model to study early
stages of tumorigenesis. Given these properties, we speculate that
Smad2 is a critical part of the tumor suppressor pathway of TGF-h
in the prostate, and this function of Smad2 may be particularly
important in the basal or stem cell compartment of this gland.
Consistent with the refractory nature of silencing Smad3 in NRP152 cells, total Smad3 and TGF-h–induced phospho-Smad3 levels
in this line are substantially less than in NRP-154 cells, whereas
those of Smad2 are similar in both lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Interestingly, Smad3 is selectively induced in NRP-152 cells
undergoing transdifferentiation toward a luminal phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. S1B and C), and we observed relatively higher
Smad2 to Smad3 ratios in basal versus luminal rat prostate
epithelial cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We thus speculate
that a relatively higher Smad2 to Smad3 ratio could be a general
property of prostate basal versus luminal epithelial cells.
The possibility that Smad2 has a selective role in stem cell
function is consistent with the fact that knockout of Smad2 but not
Smad3 causes embryonic death (5), and with the appearance of
many more inactivating mutations in Smad2 versus in Smad3 in a
variety of tumors (7). We thus speculate that the cytostatic or
tumor suppressor function of Smad2 may be lost during
differentiation of normal tissues or during prostatic carcinogenesis.
If so, identifying the molecular basis for such loss/inactivation and
finding ways to restore the cytostatic function of Smad2 holds great
promise for the therapeutic intervention of prostate cancer.
