Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 in Cancer:
Rationale and Insight for Future Therapeutic
Testing
Veronica R. Placencio1,2 and Yves A. DeClerck1,2,3

Abstract
Despite its function as an inhibitor of urokinase and tissue-type
plasminogen activator (PA), PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has a paradoxical protumorigenic role in cancer, promoting angiogenesis and
tumor cell survival. In this review, we summarize preclinical evidence in support of the protumorigenic function of PAI-1 that has

led to the testing of small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitors, initially
developed as antithrombotic agents, in animal models of cancer.
The review discusses the challenges and the opportunities that lay
ahead to the development of efﬁcacious and nontoxic PAI-1 inhibitors as anticancer agents. Cancer Res; 75(15); 2969–74. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Adding to the complexity of the function of PAI-1 in cancer is
the fact that it can have paracrine and autocrine effects as it is
produced by tumor cells and nonmalignant cells, including
endothelial cells (EC), macrophage cells, or adipocytes in the
tumor microenvironment.
On the basis of the protumorigenic role of uPA in angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis, it was anticipated that
PAI-1 would have an antitumorigenic function. Surprisingly,
several studies revealed a paradoxical association between
elevated levels of PAI-1 in blood and tissue samples of cancer
patients and an unfavorable clinical outcome and poor
response to therapy (1, 5). The observation that the production
of PAI-1 by EC, ﬁbroblasts, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells,
and macrophage cells in the tumor microenvironment was
stimulated by protumorigenic factors such as TGFb, IL6, and
TNFa added further evidence supporting a protumorigenic role
(6, 7). In this article, we review the mechanisms and evidence in
mouse models supporting a protumorigenic function for PAI-1.
We then present recent pharmacologic approaches and preclinical studies aimed at targeting PAI-1 in cancer and discuss the
lessons learned from these studies.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and the main regulator of the plasminogen activation system. It acts by inhibiting tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPA; ref. 1). PAI-1 has a pleiotropic biologic function that stems from its complex structure. Three speciﬁc
protein-binding domains in the molecule have been well
characterized (Fig. 1; ref. 1): a domain in the reactive center
loop (RCL) that binds to PA, a domain in the ﬂexible joint
region that binds to vitronectin composed of helix D (hD),
helix E (hE), and helix F (hF), and a domain within hD and hE
that binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
(LRP1). Upon binding to the RCL, PA cleaves PAI-1 at P1-P1'
inducing a dynamic conformational change that inserts the
RCL as a b-strand (4A) into the core of the protein. The binding
of PAI-1 to PA forms a catalytically inactive complex, which is
internalized when combined with the receptor for uPA (uPAR)
and LRP1 (2). Premature insertion of the RCL into the b-sheet
is the basis for the conversion of active PAI-1 into its latent
form. Binding of PAI-1 to LRP1 also promotes cell migration
and signaling (3). Binding of the ﬂexible joint region of PAI-1
to vitronectin has multiple consequences: it masks the adjacent
RGD-binding site for av integrins and inhibits cell attachment
to vitronectin (2) and stabilizes PAI-1 inhibiting its conversion
to latency and increasing its anti-uPA ability by 200-fold (4).

PAI-1 Is Proangiogenic
A ﬁrst clue explaining the paradoxical association of PAI-1
with more aggressive forms of cancer came from the observation by several laboratories, including our own, that PAI-1
has a proangiogenic activity through its antiprotease and
vitronectin-binding functions. The activity of PAI-1 on angiogenesis is, however, dose dependent with a promoting activity
at physiologic concentrations (8, 9) and an inhibitory activity
at pharmacologic concentrations (10). This is explained by
the fact that at physiologic concentrations, PAI-1 inhibition of
uPA limits the cleavage by pericellular plasmin of membraneassociated Fas-L at R144-K145 and the release of a soluble
Fas-L fragment that induces Fas-mediated apoptosis in EC
(11). PAI-1 also stimulates angiogenesis through its vitronectin-binding function promoting the detachment of EC
from vitronectin and their migration toward ﬁbronectin rich
tissues (9).

PAI-1 Inhibits Spontaneous Apoptosis in
Cancer Cells
PAI-1 protects tumor cells from apoptosis through multiple
mechanisms. Similar to EC, it inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis in
several human cancer cells, including brain metastasis through its
control over pericellular plasmin activity (12, 13). PAI-1 also
affects intrinsic apoptosis, as the absence of extracellular PAI-1 in
tumor cells results in higher levels of activated caspase-9 (14).
Intracellular PAI-1 also promotes cell survival through its ability
to inhibit caspase-3 protecting tumor cells from chemotherapyinduced apoptosis (15).

What Have We Learned from Mouse Tumor
Models?
Observations in PAI-1–deﬁcient mice have provided additional
and important clues on the function of PAI-1 in tumorigenesis
and angiogenesis. The vast majority of experiments using PAI-1–
deﬁcient murine tumor cells syngeneically implanted into WT or
PAI-1–deﬁcient mice consistently demonstrated the contributory
role of host and tumor-derived PAI-1 to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (Table 1; refs. 10, 16–21). Consistently,

2970 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

maximum antitumor effect was shown upon PAI-1 suppression in
both host and tumor cells pointing to a combined role for
extracellular PAI-1. Similar observations were made when PAI1–deﬁcient human tumor cells were xenotransplanted in immunodeﬁcient PAI-1 null mice. These studies typically demonstrated
that suppression of PAI-1 expression in human tumor cells and in
mouse host cells resulted in poor tumor take and slower tumor
growth (11, 12, 22, 23). However in some situations, such as in
skin carcinoma, the effects observed depended on the tumor grade
with minimal effects observed in high-grade tumors (23).
In contrast with the above data, experiments using genetically
engineered mice (GEM) prone to develop cancer crossed with PAI1 null mice failed to demonstrate any effect of PAI-1 suppression
on tumor initiation, growth, or metastasis. For example, when FVBPymT mice prone to develop mammary tumors were crossed with
PAI-1 null mice, there was no effect on the development of
mammary tumors, metastasis, or survival (24). Similarly, genetic
ablation of PAI-1 had no effect on tumor development in Apc/
Apc1638N/PAI-1–/– mice prone to develop colon cancer (25), in
TRP-1SV40 Tag/PAI-1/ mice prone to develop ocular tumors
(26), and in K14-HPV16/PAI-1/ mice prone to develop skin
cancer (27). An explanation for this difference of effect
between transplanted and GEM mice is the possible presence of

compensatory serpins, including PAI-2, protein C inhibitor, protease nexin-1, or maspin (28–31), whose overexpression in transformed cells may have compensated for a lack of PAI-1 (27–31).

Pharmacologic Inhibition of PAI-1
Over the last two decades, several laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed a variety of small-molecule PAI-1
inhibitors using high-throughput screening (32). The vast majority of these inhibitors are molecules interfering with the molecular
interactions of PAI-1 to inhibit tPA and uPA by binding to the
reactive center loop and by inducing a conformational change that
promotes an irreversible conversion of PAI-1 into its latent form.
To our knowledge, no inhibitors speciﬁcally interacting with the
vitronectin-binding domain of PAI-1 have been reported yet. The
main focus of investigations on the activity of these inhibitors in
biologic processes has been in cardiovascular diseases (thrombus
repermeabilization), lung ﬁbrosis, Alzheimer's disease and to a
lesser degree in cancer. A ﬁrst family of PAI-1 inhibitors developed
consisted of diketopiperazine inhibitors that interfere with uPA
binding to the protease-binding domain of the RCL. These inhibitors (XR334, XR1853, XR5082, and XR5118) block tPA inhibition by PAI-1 in vitro (33, 34). However, their in vivo efﬁcacy is
limited by their low solubility, poor oral availability, or high IC50
values (in the 5 to >1,000 mmol/L range) that are unachievable in
the blood upon administration in animals. Other menthol-based,
benzothiophene, and butadiene small molecules with lower IC50
values (0.64 to 44 mmol/L) in vitro were developed (35–37);
however, despite their good anti-PAI-1 activity in vitro, they were
either not tested or not further pursued in animal experiments for
reasons not reported.
One indole oxoacetic acid PAI-1 inhibitor, PAI-039 (tiplaxtinin; ref. 38), was extensively and successfully tested for its antith-

rombotic activity in preclinical rat and canine models of acute
arterial thrombosis (38, 39). Other inhibitors derived from the
structure of this inhibitor (PAI-749 and PAZ-417) then underwent
human phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers and in patients
with Alzheimer's disease (40–42). To date, the results of these
studies have not been reported.
As an alternative approach, using computer simulation models
mimicking the RCL insertion within the strands of b-sheet A,
conformation disrupting agents were designed. Such compounds
include a family of dimeric 2-acylamino-3-thiophenecarboxylic
acid derivatives (TM5001 and TM5007) developed with the
anticipation that by binding to the s4A position of the A b-sheet,
they would induce the conversion of PAI-1 into its latent and
inactive form (43). These inhibitors were found active against
vascular thrombosis in a rat model and against lung ﬁbrosis in
murine models. Their pharmacokinetic properties, however, were
suboptimal due to their relatively high lipophilicity [calculated
octanol/water partition coefﬁcient (ClogP) value of 5.79, above
the ideal 2–3 value]. A second-generation molecule (TM5275)
with better oral pharmacokinetic properties and lower ClogP of
3.37 was then developed (44). TM5275 showed activity in rat and
mouse models of acute arterial thrombosis and lung ﬁbrosis.
Importantly, this inhibitor had no systemic toxicity as it did not
prolong bleeding time in nonhuman primates (45).
A limiting element in the activity of these inhibitors so far, has
been their lack of activity against the stable form of PAI-1 bound to
vitronectin (46). Thus, the recent focus has been on the development of inhibitors active against vitronectin-bound PAI-1.
These efforts, however, have been limited by a lack of crystal
structure information on vitronectin-bound PAI-1 (47). Polyphenolic inhibitors of PAI-1 (CDE-066 and 096) synthesized on the
basis of the structure of small molecules identiﬁed by a highthroughput screen were found to bind to the sB/sC pocket of PAI-1

with an IC50 of 32 mmol/L and 25 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1;
refs. 48, 49). CDE-096 induces allosteric conformational changes
affecting the ﬂexibility of PAI-1 and preventing it from binding to
PA and decreasing vitronectin binding (49). CDE-096 was still
able to interact with vitronectin-bound PAI-1, although the magnitude of polarization was decreased 7.3-fold compared with
binding-free PAI-1. The in vivo pharmacokinetic proﬁle of these
inhibitors is unknown.

Pharmacologic Inhibition of PAI-1 in Cancer
Therapy
Pharmacologic inhibition of PAI-1 in cardiovascular diseases
has been the primary goal with the objective to prevent inhibition
of intravascular ﬁbrinolysis and subsequently promote thrombus
repermeabilization in an acute setting. In contrast, preclinical
evidence supporting the therapeutic efﬁcacy of small PAI-1 inhibitors in cancer has been limited (Table 2). In cancer, the objective
is to prevent inhibition of pericellular activation of plasminogen
and interfere with PAI-1-vitronectin interactions. Although in
cardiovascular and thrombotic disease, the desired inhibition is
short-term; in cancer (or other chronic conditions), it is long-term
requiring a pharmacologic proﬁle suitable for chronic administration (32).
Insofar, four small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitors have been tested
in preclinical models of cancer. Although limited, these studies
have shown antitumor activity. SK-116 and SK-216 inhibitors
administered orally for 9 weeks to Apc/Apc1638N mice that
spontaneously developed intestinal polyps caused an almost 2fold reduction in the number of small intestinal polyps (50).
When administered to PAI-1 producing Lewis lung carcinoma and
PAI-1–nonproducing B16 melanoma tumor-bearing mice, SK216 caused a 2-fold reduction in subcutaneous primary tumor
size and inhibited angiogenesis and metastases (51). The oral
administration of PAI-039 to mice xenotransplanted with human
T24 bladder and HeLa cervical cancer cells resulted in a 2-fold
reduction of tumor volume after 14 days associated with a
decrease in tumor cell proliferation and vascularization and an
increase in apoptosis (52). The TM5275 inhibitor was recently
shown to increase apoptosis in vitro in ovarian cancer cell lines
(53). The in vivo activity of these inhibitors in cancer models have
not been reported with the exception of TM5275 and TM5441 in a
most recent study (54).

Challenges and Opportunities
Despite the fact that much is known on the structure of PAI-1,
its complex biologic function, and its protumorigenic role in

cancer progression, its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer has only been recently considered and explored.
These studies provide important insight on the need to develop
better inhibitors for cancer. The need for chronic administration
and thus a pharmacologic proﬁle with a prolonged plasma halflife of orally available inhibitors is an important consideration.
Although much work has been done on the development of orally
available compounds, the half-life of these inhibitors in vivo is 2 to
3 hours and therefore would be impractical in long-term cancer
therapy. The fact that most inhibitors developed until now are
active in vitro at concentrations in the mmol/L range represents
another limitation. Such concentrations are typically difﬁcult to
reach in blood and more importantly in tumor tissues for an
extensive period of time. The lack of activity of most inhibitors
against the stable vitronectin-bound form of PAI-1 is a third
limitation, since this is the predominant form of PAI-1 in vitronectin-rich tumor tissues (55). A fourth limitation is the potential
systemic effect that the chronic administration of PAI-1 inhibitors
may have on hemostasis. By suppressing the control that PAI-1
exerts on plasmin-mediated ﬁbrinolysis, small-molecule PAI-1
inhibitors may impair hemostasis and cause excessive spontaneous bleeding (56). Although studies in nonhuman primates have
shown an absence of side effects on systemic hemostasis following the chronic administration of some PAI-1 inhibitors (44, 45),
this aspect deserves more extensive investigation.
In summary, targeting PAI-1 in cancer therapy remains an
attractive but also challenging approach that will require the
design and development of inhibitors that address some of the
current limitations outlined above. As new inhibitors with better
pharmacologic proﬁles are developed, they should continue to be
tested in preclinical models of cancer.
