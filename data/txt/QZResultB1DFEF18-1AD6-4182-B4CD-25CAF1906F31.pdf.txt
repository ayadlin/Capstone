ABSTRACT
Tumor initiating cells (TICs) possessing cancer stemness were shown to be
enriched after therapy, resulting in the relapse and metastasis of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNC). An effective therapeutic approach suppressing
the HNC-TICs would be a potential method to improve the treatments for HNC. We
observed that the treatment of silibinin (SB) dose dependently down-regulated the
ALDH1 activity, CD133 positivity, stemness signatures expression, self-renewal
property, and chemoresistance in ALDH1+CD44+ HNC-TICs. Using miRNA-microarray
and mechanistic studies, SB increased the expression of microRNA-494 (miR-494) and
both Bmi1 and ADAM10 were identified as the novel targets of miR-494. Moreover,
overexpression of miR-494 results in a reduction in cancer stemness. However,
knockdown of miR-494 in CD44−ALDH1- non-HNC-TICs enhanced cancer stemness
and oncogenicity, while co-knockdown of Bmi1 and ADAM10 effectively reversed
these phenomena. Mice model showed that SB treatment by oral gavage to xenograft
tumors reduced tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing
mice by activation of miR-494-inhibiting Bmi1/ADAM10 expression. Survival analysis
indicated that a miR494highBmi1lowADAM10low phenotype predicted a favourable clinical
outcome. We conclude that the inhibition of tumor aggressiveness in HNC-TICs by
SB was mediated by up-regulation miR-494, suggesting that SB would be a valuable
anti-cancer drug for treatment of HNC.

radiotherapy [2, 3]. Most patients, however, relapse
within months after radiochemotherapy [2, 3]. Despite the
improvements in the diagnosis and management of HNC,
long-term survival rate remains poor and more than 50%
of patients die of this disease or related complications
within 5 years [2, 3]. Mounting evidence has showed
that the resistance to chemoradiation therapy and other

currently available targeted therapies are, in part, due to
the survival of a subpopulation of cells, called cancer
stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells (TICs), within
the heterogeneous tumor mass. TICs possesses cancer
stemness and further enriches after therapy, resulting
in the relapse, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of
tumors [4-6]. HNC cells that express CD44 and ALDH1,
as well as are able to form spheres in suspension culture,
are proposed to be used for enriching TICs in HNC (HNCTICs) [7-10]. More importantly, HNC-TICs present
elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits
and are highly metastatic, tumorigenic, and resistant to
radio and chemotherapies [7]. Identification of selective
anti-TICs strategies would be a therapeutic intervention
to improve the treatments for HNC-related malignancies.
Silibinin (SB), a polyphenolic flavonoid isolated
from the milk thistle plant Silybum marianum, has been
used since ancient times in traditional European medicine,
and is well-known for its hepatoprotective and pleiotropic
anti-carcinogenic effect on a variety of experimental
cancer models including head and neck cancers [11-13].
SB exerted an inhibitory effect on invasion ability of SCC4
head and neck cancer cells by reducing phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, MMP-2, and u-PA expression [11]. Substantial
evidence has demonstrated that SB inhibited proliferation,
migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis and
induced apoptosis via modulating multiple signaling
pathfways, such as notch [14], Wnt/β-catenin [15], and
Stat3 [16], in cancer cells. Besides, the anti-tumorigenecity
effect of SB was recently extended to TICs in colon cancer
and bladder cancer [17, 18]. SB is able to inhibit cancer
stemness and epithelial–mesenchymal transition in bladder
cancer cells by inactivation β-catenin/ZEB1 signaling
[17]. SB has been shown as potent inhibitor of colon CSCs
[18]. Though substantial evidence has demonstrated that
SB inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
and induced apoptosis in HNC [11], the efficacy of SB in
the specific subset of HNC-TIC is still remained elusive.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding
RNAs regulating the gene expression by binding to the
3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, has been
reported as pathogenesis signature in various types of
cancers [19-21]. MicroRNA-494 (miR-494), located in
human chromosome 14q32, function as tumor suppressive
or oncogenic miRNAs in different types of tumors
[22]. Low expression of miR-494 has been reported in
prostate cancer [23], lung cancer [22], gastrointestinal
stromal tumors [24], and cholangiocarcinoma [25]. In
opposite, miR-494 in up-regulated in colorectal cancer
[26]. Increasing reports have shown the involvements
of miRNAs the regulation of TICs properties [27-29].
For example, miR200a reduced the stem-like state and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibiting
ZEB2 and β-catenin signalings in nasopharygeal
carnicoma cells [30]. miR34a directly targets the 3’ UTR
regions of CD44 and repressed cancer stemness and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastasis in prostate cancer [31]. We previously showed
that suppression of miR145 enables HNCs cells to acquire
TICs properties [9]. However, it is unclear whether miR494 is involved in regulating cancer stemness.
In this report, we evaluate the efficacy of silibinin
in HNC-TICs in terms of cell proliferation, TIC markers
expression, self-renewal, and in vivo tumorigenecity.
miRNAs microarray analysis of the silibinin-treated
HNC-TICs revealed that miR-494 might be a novel
miRNA that suppresses the TICs effect of SB in HNCTICs. We identified Bmi1 and ADAM10 as novel direct
targets of miR-494, through which miR-494 mediates
silibinin-dependent inhibition of HNC-TICs. We showed
that silibinin enhanced the sensitivity of HNC-TICs to
chemotherapeutic. Meanwhile, suppression of miR494 is correlated with poor patient survival and high
lymph node metastatic incidence. We demonstrate the
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effect, as well as
the downstream mechanisms, of silibinin in tackling HNCTICs in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Silibinin preferentially eliminates cancer stemness
in HNC-TICs
ALDH1 and CD44 has been demonstrated to be a
marker of distinguishing malignant from premalignant
cells as well as identifying the putative HNC-TICs [32,
33]. We first determined whether silibinin (SB) has any
cytotoxic effect to normal human oral epithelial cells (SG)
and HNC cells-isolated ALDH1+ CD44+ HNC-TICs. As
shown in Figure 1A, SB could suppress cell proliferation
of two ALDH1+CD44+ HNC-TICs (SAS and OECM1) in
a dose-dependent manner by MTT assay (Figure 1A). The
effect of SB on normal human oral epithelial cells (SG)
revealed that this compound did not have any significant
cytotoxicity on these cells (Figure 1A). SB also displayed
cytotoxic effects to parental HNC cell lines (SAS and
OECM1) (Suppl. Figure 1A). Successful sphere formation
phenotypes after serial passages of culture is one of
indexes for evaluating the persistent self-renewal capacity
of TICs [34]. To investigate the effect of SB in repressing
self-renewal of HNC-TICs, we evaluated the secondary
sphere-forming ability with SB treatment in HNC-TICs. In
HNC-TICs dose-dependently treated with SB, the sphereforming ability among the HNC-TICs was consistently
impaired (Figure 1B). The HNC cells with TIC properties
have been also isolated by sorting the cells expressing
specific marker, CD133 [35]. Our data suggested SB
treatment significantly decrease CD133 (Figure 1C) and
ALDH1 (Figure 1D) activity of both HNC-TICs in a
concentration-dependent manner. To further determine
whether the reduction in TICs efficiency with SB

HNC-TICs. Overall, our data indicate that SB dosedependently inhibits tumor-initiating activity including
colony formation (Figure 2A) and migration (Figure
2B) and invasion (Figure 2C) abilities of HNC-TICs.
Recent studies indicated that glioma or ovarian TICs
could differentiate into vasculogenic mimicry [37,
38]. Whether HNC-TICs contribute to vasculogenic
mimicry remain unclear. HNC-TICs were able to form
vessel-like structures (Figure 2D). SB treatment caused
inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry of HNC-TICs (Figure
2D). Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a dedifferentiation program that converts adherent epithelial
cells into individual migratory cells, is thought to be a key
step in the induction of cancer stemness [39, 40]. Since
we have found that the effect of SB on migratory/invasion

treatment due to decreased stemness markers expression,
stemness genes (Oct-4, Nanog, and Nestin) of HNC-TICs
with control (DMSO) and different concentration of SB
treatment were determined by real-time PCR and western
blot analysis. The results confirmed that SB-treated HNCTICs markedly reduced the mRNA and protein expression
level of Oct-4, Nanog, and Nestin in both HNC-TICs
(Figure 1E). In summary, down-regulation of cancer
stemness by SB in HNC-TICs suggests SB treatment as
potential compound on eliminating TICs in HNC.

Anti-invasive and reversal EMT activity of SB in
HNC-TICs
Since TICs appear to play a significant role
in tumorigenesis and metastasis [36], we sought to

ability in HNC-TICs, we then keep on exploring whether
the SB-mediated TICs depends on EMT pathway. Realtime RT-PCR analysis demonstrated down-regulation of
mesenchymal-like (ZEB1, Snail, and Vimentin) transcript
was seen in HNC-TICs with SB treatment (Suppl. Figure
1B). With western blotting, we demonstrated that SB
treatment down-regulated a pattern of mesenchymallike proteins (ZEB1, Snail, and Vimentin) and induced
epithelial protein (E-cadherin) in HNC-TICs (Figure 2E).
SB pre-treated HNC-TICs dramatically decreased tumor
volume in the xenograft (Suppl. Figure 1C).

parental HNC cells. Importantly, cell viability assays
showed that SB ameliorated the drug resistance of
HNC-TICs to doxorubicin or cisplatin or fluorouracil
(5-FU) treatment (Figure 3A). Flow cytometry analysis
indicated that, in HNC-TICs treated with SB treatment,
the percentage of ABCG2 positivity was reduced (Figure
3B). The combination SB and cisplatin treatment also
showed a synergistic effect in promoting apoptosis
in HNC-TICs (Figure 3C). Treatment with cisplatin
alone did not affect the clonogenicity in HNC-TICs, the
combination of SB and cisplatin co-treatment enhanced
the efficacy of these treatments (Figure 3D). Meanwhile,
similar synergistic effect of SB and cisplatin chemotreatment was also observed in migration (Figure 3E) and
invasion (Figure 3F) assay. Taken together, SB exhibited
a prominent therapeutic effect in enhancing the sensitivity
of chemotherapy in HNC-TICs.

Enhanced chemosensitivity and apopotosis in
HNC-TICs by SB
Recurrence of cancers after conventional therapeutic
treatments is thought to be due to re-emergence of
chemotherapy-resistant TICs [41]. As expected, HNCTICs were more chemoresistant compared with the

miRNA, including miR-363-5p, miR-4443, miR-4448,
miR-4454, miR-720, miR-668, and miR-494 (Figure 4A).
Results showed that miR-494 expression was significantly
increased in HNC-TICs with SB dose-dependent treatment
(Figure 4A). Real-time RT-PCR analysis further confirmed
that SB treatment showed a dose-dependent increase in
the levels of miR-494 expression in HNC-TICs (Figure
4B). Using the Target Scan program, we identified
potential miR-494 targeting sites in the 3’UTR regions of
Bmi1 and ADAM10. Bmi-1, a member of the Polycomb
(PcG) family of transcriptional repressors, mediates
gene silencing by regulating chromatin structure [43].
Bmi-1 was shown being involved in tumor initiation,
self-renewal, and metastasis in malignant carcinomas
including HNC [44]. Strong expression of Bmi1 is shown
as an indicator of a poor prognosis for HNC patients
[45]. A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10),
membrane-bound cell surface glycoproteins, has been

reports have shown the involvements of miRNAs in the
anti-tumor effects of SB in several types of malignant
cancers [42]. However, the miRNAs that mediate SBdependent regulatory mechanisms in HNC-TICs remain
unclear. Control and SB-treated HNC-TICs were subjected
to miRNAs microarray analyses to attempt to identify
the SB-modulated specific miRNAs that mediate cancer
stemness of HNC-TICs (Figure 4A). HNC-TICs with
SB treatment resulted increase in the levels of various

shown to be responsible for angiogenesis, development,
angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis [46]. The expression
of ADAM10 is correlated with stemness properties
in normal stem cells and cancer stem cells [47, 48].
Silencing ADAM10 effectively attenuated migration and
invasiveness in HNC cells through MMPs up-regulation
[49]. It is unclear whether miR-494 directly targets the
3’UTR of Bmi1 and ADAM10. Further, we constructed
reporter plasmids containing either full-length, serial
deletion (the potential miR-494 targeting site was deleted)
(Figure 4C), or mutated forms of the 3’UTR region of
Bmi1 and ADAM10 (Figure 4D). Luciferase reporter
assays demonstrated that miR-494 reduced the luciferase
activity of reporter plasmids containing full-length Bmi1
and ADAM10 3’UTR (Figure 4E & Figure 4F). However,

when the potential Bmi1 and ADAM10 targeting site
was deleted or mutated, miR-494 no longer inhibited the
luciferase activity (Figure 4E & Figure 4F). Consistently,
the protein levels of ADAM10 and Bmi1 were decreased
in the miR-494-overexpressing HNC-TICs (Figure 4H).
These results identified a crucial miR-494 binding site
on the 3’UTR of Bmi1 and ADAM10 to suppress its
expression. Consistently, real-time RT-PCR and western
blotting analysis showed that SB treatment of HNC-TICs
also suppressed the mRNA and protein levels of Bmi1 and
ADAM10, which our data implicated as targets of miR494 (Suppl. Figure 1D & Suppl. Figure 1E).

mice, the tumor initiation capacity in HNC-TICs was
suppressed by miR-494-overexpression (Suppl. Figure
2C). In contrast, suppressing miR-494 expression with
an miRNA SPONGE (Spg-miR-494) in CD44−ALDH1−
non-HNC-TICs (Suppl. Figure 2D) dramatically resulted
in increased Bmi1 and ADAM10 protein levels, while
co-knockdown of Bmi1 and ADAM10 reversed this
effect (Figure 5D). Silencing of endogenous miR-494
induced self-renewal capability in CD44−ALDH1− cells,
which would be blocked by co-knockdown of Bmi1
and ADAM10 treatment (Figure 5E). Consistently, coknockdown Bmi1 and ADAM10 expression decreased
the enhancing effect of Spg-miR-494 on clonogenicity
(Figure 5F) and invasiveness (Figure 5G) in ALDH1CD44- cells. To further link this regulatory mechanism to

reduced following xenotransplantation of HNC-TICs that

to control animals (Figure 6A). Moreover, by day 20, SB

increased miR-494 expression (Figure 6E) and decreased
Bmi1 and ADAM10 expression (Figure 6F) in comparison
to those from control HNC-TICs tumors. By monitoring

Further analysis of miR-494 expression levels in different
stages of HNC specimens revealed a correlation between
low miR-494 expression levels and advanced stage
(Figure 7B). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that
Bmi1 and ADAM10 expression was highly expressed in
high-grade HNC specimens, compared with the low-grade
counter parts (Figure 7C). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
of HNC patients showed that high-expression for Bmi1,
ADAM10, had a reduced survival rate; whereas patients
with low expression of miR-494 had a poor survival
rate (Figure 7D). Most of importance, patients with an
expression profile of miR494lowBmi1highADAM10high
had the lowest survival rate compared with those with
miR494highBmi1lowADAM10low (Figure 7D). These
findings revealed a miR494lowBmi1highADAM10high as a

cancer stemness (Figure 7E).

in HNC-TICs (Figure 1). Increasing reports have shown
the involvements of miRNAs in the anti-tumor effects of
SB. SB was also reported to inhibit erlotinib-resistance
in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer cells by
switching on suppressor miRNAs such as miR-200c [42].
In the present study, SB suppressed HNC cancer stemness
via enhancing miR-494-mediated suppression of Bmi1
and ADAM10. We identified Bmi1 and ADAM10 as novel
downstream targets of miR-494 (Figure 4). The detail role
of ADAM10 in regulating cancer stemness in HNC-TICs
may need further investigation.
Evidence in recent reports indicates the chemoresistance is mainly caused by cancer stemness [41]. SB
in combination with 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel would
effectively prevent the emergence of chemoresistance
in renal carcinoma cells [13]. A combination of SB
and doxorubicin demonstrated a significant growth
suppressive effect in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells-xenograft compared to treatment with either agent
alone [53]. In mouse xenograft model, oral delivery
SB treatment lessened tumor initiating activity in vivo.
However, oral feeding SB to mouse-bearing tumors did not
completely lead to tumor regression of HN-CICs. In our
in vitro data, we showed that SB synergized with cisplatin
or 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin to prevent the persistent
survival of HNC-TICs and enhance the efficacy of these
chemotherapies (Figure 3). It would be important to
examine SB combine with chemoradiotherapeutic therapy
treatment on suppressing HNC-TICs-bearing in the future.
t is likely that through enhancing miR-494, SB suppresses
the potentially emerging drug-resistance of HNC-TICs
and allows cisplatin to eliminate HNC-TICs. Recent
reports have shown that epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT) traits are essential to maintain self-renewal,
tumorigenicity, and metastasis of TICs. For example,
Snail/Slug/Twist, important transcription factors of EMT,
govern the development of TICs which responsible for
cancer initiation, drug resistance and metastasis [39, 40].
We first demonstrated that SB inhibited mesenchymal
markers (ZEB1, Snail, and Vimentin) expression and upregulated epithelial marker (E-cadherin) expression levels
of HNC-TICs (Figure 2E), suggesting SB as blockers of
EMT. Therefore, it is interesting to ask whether miR-494
is involved in regulating chemoresistance and EMT in
HNC-TICs.
Conclusively, the present report showed that the
SB effectively suppressed self-renewal, tumor-initiating,
and chemoreisitance properties of HNC-TICs in vitro and
in vivo partially through miR-494 activation. miR-494targeting Bmi1 and ADAM10 expression would greatly
contribute to a deeper understanding of cancer stemness
acquisition in HNC, and promote the development
of promising therapeutics for HNC-TICs eradication.
Experimental platforms that are more close to clinical
operation are expected to support the therapeutic potential
of SB in HNC patents treatment.

DISCUSSION
Aberrant microRNA-494 (miR-494) expression has
been shown to regulate cancer tumorigenicity in several
types of cancer through modulating target genes and
multiple signaling pathways [23, 50, 51]. For example,
miR-494 inhibits proliferation rate in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors cells through directly repression of the KIT
[24]. MiR-494 has also been demonstrated to attenuates
tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by
targeting FOXM1 [52]. However, the role of miR-494
in HNC-TICs remains unclear. In this study, we showed
that miR-494 directly binds to the 3’UTR regions of Bmi1
and ADAM10 in HNC-TICs (Figure 4), thus represses
the tumorigenecity and TIC properties such as sphere
formation capability, CD44 and ALDH1 expression,
clonogenic ability, and in vivo tumor initiation incident
(Figure 5). Co-knockdown of Bmi1 and ADAM10
rescued the induction effect of spg-miR-494 on TIC
properties (Figure 5). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
showed that the overexpression of Bmi1, ADAM10,
or underexpression of miR-494 had a shorter overall
survival in HNC patients; miR494lowBmi1highADAM10high
signature presented the worst outcome in HNC patients
(Figure 7D). Meanwhile, the result showed a pattern of
low miR-494 expression in the metastatic and advanced
stage tissues (Figure 7A). Clinical results suggested
that a miR494lowBmi1highADAM10high signature could
be a potential predictor for disease progression and
poor clinical outcome of HNC patients (Figure 7D).
To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating
the regulatory role of the miR494-targeting Bmi1 and
ADAM10 expression in the regulation of cancer stemness
(Figure 7E). This report identified a novel miR-494dependent tumor suppression pathway that is able to
eliminate the persistent TIC cells.
Mounting studies have suggested that dietary
compounds interfere with tumor-initiating- and cancer
stemness-related pathways, and therefore offer a promising
approach for cancer prevention [34]. Silibinin (SB) has
been recognized as a promising anticancer drug and is
being developed as a chemopreventive agent in various
cancers [11-13]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that
SB has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative,
and pro-apoptotic activities [11-13]. Interestingly, SB
also inhibits TIC-like properties in colon and bladder
cancers [17, 18]. We found that greater inhibition effect
on HNC-TICs in terms of survival upon SB treatment;
while normal oral epithelial cells were not repressed by
this compound. SB seems specifically reduced the sphere
formation, colony formation, and tumor-initiation abilities

the cell density of passage will be 10000 cells/ml in the
serum-free medium as described above [7].

Reagents and cell culture

Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT)PCR

Silibinin was purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO) and was dissolved in DMSO
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as a stock solution of
100 mM. Just before use, Silibinin was further diluted
in culture medium to appropriate final concentrations.
The Smulow–Glickman (S-G) human gingival epithelial
cell line was original from F.H. Kasten, East Tennessee
State University, Quillen College of Medicine, Johnson
City, TN [54]; SAS, a high-grade tumorigenic human
tongue squamous cell carcinoma, was obtained from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo,
Japan) [55]; Human gingival squamous carcinoma cells
(OECM-1) were provided from Dr. C. L. Meng (National
Defense Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan) grown in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured at 37°C
containing 5% CO2.

Total RNA was prepared from cells or tissues using
Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). qRT–PCRs of mRNAs were reversetranscribed using the Superscript III first-strand synthesis
system for RT–PCR (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR reactions on
resulting cDNAs were performed on an ABI StepOne™
Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) [7]. Primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Western blot
The extraction of proteins from cells and western
blot analysis were performed as described. Samples (15
µL) were boiled at 95°C for 5 min and separated by 10 %
SDS-PAGE. The proteins were wet-transferred to HybondECL nitrocellulose paper (Amersham, Arlington Heights,
IL, USA). The following primary antibodies were listed
in Supplementary Table 2. Immunoreactive protein bands
were detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham
Biosciences Co., Piscataway, NJ, USA) [7].

Isolation of ALDH1+ CD44+ HNC-TICs
CD44-positive and ALDH1-positive cells in
HNC cells using CD44 antibody (phycoerythrin
conjugated, BioLegend) and the Aldefluor assay (Stem
Cell Technologies), followed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis (FACS). Technologies as described
previously [7].

miRNAs qRT–PCR anlysis
For miR-494 levels decetion, qRT–PCR was
performed using TaqMan miRNA assays with specific
primer sets (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif). All
reagents and protocols were from Applied Biosystems, and
detection was performed using a 7900HT fast real-time
PCR system [7].

Cell proliferation/survival determination by MTT
assay
For evaluation of cell proliferation, 1×104 cells/
well in 0.1 % DMSO or different concentration of
silibinin-containing medium and cultured at 37°C for
24hr. Cell proliferation/survival was determined by MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) assay. The MTT test was conducted according
to previously used protocols [34].

MiR-494 Sponge
Oligos for miR-494 sponge, and scramble
construction were constructed using a pcDNA 6.2-GW/
EmGFP-miR plasmid (Invitrogen).MicroRNA SPONGE
sequence design was based on previous report [56].
Further multiple copy amplifications were done with
recovery of BamH1 and XhoI digested fragments and
subcloned into pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR plasmid [7].

Tumorsphere-forming assay
Tumor cells were dissociated and cultured as
tumorspheres in modified DMEM/F-12 supplemented
with N2 (R&D), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF,
Invitrogen), 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF, Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin at 103 live
cells/low-attachment six-well plate (Corning Inc.,Corning,
NY), and the medium was changed every other day until
the tumor sphere formation was observed in about 2
weeks. For serial passage of spheroid cells, single cells
will be obtained from accurtase treated spheroids and

the dishes were incubated at 37oC for 4 weeks. Plates were
stained with 0.005% Crystal Violet then the colonies were
counted. The number of total colonies with a diameter
≥100 μm was counted over five fields per well for a total
of 15 fields in triplicate experiments [7].

randomly divided into three groups (N = 5 for each group)
and fed by oral gavage with saline (control) and silibinin
(20 and 40 mg/day/kg) suspended in PBS. The day of cell
implantation was designated day 0. Imaging measurement
was performed using an IVIS50 animal imaging system
(Xenogen Corp.). The photons emitted from the target
site penetrated through the mammalian tissue and could
be externally detected and quantified using a sensitive
light-imaging system. The image acquisition time was
1 min. The displayed images of the tumor sites were
drawn around and quantified in photons per second using
Living Image software (Xenogen Corp.) The volume
was calculated (according to the following formula:
[length × width2]/2), and then analyzed using Image-Pro
Plus software. Body weight was assessed daily after cell
injection. After 20 days, the animals were euthanized, and
the primary tumors were isolated and weighed [34].

In vitro cell invasion analysis
The 24-well plate Transwell® system with a
polycarbonate filter membrane of 8-µm pore size
(Corning, United Kingdom) was employed to evaluate the
invasion ability of cells. The membrane was coated with
MatrigelTM (BD Pharmingen, NJ, USA).The cancer cell
suspensions were seeded to the upper compartment of the
Transwell chamber at the cell density of 1×105 in 100 µl
within serum-free medium. The lower chamber was filled
with serum-free medium. or media with 10% serum After
24 hours of incubation, the medium was removed and the
filter membrane was fixed with 4% formalin for 1 hour.
Subsequently, the remaining cells of the filter membrane
faced the lower chamber was stained with Hoechst 33258
(Sigma-Aldrich). The migrated cancer cells were then
visualized and counted from 5 different visual areas of
100-fold magnification under an inverted microscope [7].

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue samples were spotted on glass slides for
immunohistochemical staining. After deparaffinization
and rehydration, tissue sections were processed with
antigen retrieval by 1X Trilogy diluted in H2O (Biogenics)
with heating. The slides were immersed in 3% H2O2 for
10 minutes and washed with PBS three times. Tissue
sections were blocked with serum (Vestastain Elite ABC
kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30
minutes, then incubated with the primary antibody in
listed in Supplementary Table 2. PBS solution at room
temperature for 2 hours. Tissue slides were washed with
PBS and incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody
for 30 min, then incubated with streptavidin-horse radish
peroxidase conjugates for 30 min, and washed with
PBS three times. Tissue sections were then immersed
with chromogen 3-3’-diaminobenzidine plus H2O2
substrate solution (Vector® DBA/Ni substrate kit, SK4100, Vector Laboratories) for 10 minutes. Hematoxylin
was applied for counter-staining (Sigma Chemical Co.,)
Finally, the tumor sections were mounted with a cover
slide with Gurr® (BDH Laboratory Supplies, UK) and
examined under a microscope. Pathologists scoring the
immunohistochemistry were blinded to the clinical data.
The interpretation was done in five high-power views
for each slide, and 100 cells per view were counted for
analysis [7].

Annexin V-FITC and PI staining assay
Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry with
annexin V-FITC and PI staining. In brief, the cells were
treated with SB alone or combined cisplatin treatment for
24 h. The treated cells were collected, washed twice with
PBS, and subjected to annexin V and PI staining by using
Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit 2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s step-by-step protocol.
Recombinant annexin V conjugated to fluorophores
and Alexa fluoro 488 dye provided maximum detection
sensitivity. After staining, flow cytometry was performed
to quantify apoptotic cells

Imaging measurement of tumor growth in nude
mice
All procedures involving animals were in
accordance with the institutional animal welfare guidelines
of the Chung Shan Medical University. For the nude mice
xenograft model, 5-6 weeks old immuno-deficient nude
mice (BALB/c nu/nu mice) weighing 18-22 g were used.
The mice were housed with a regular 12 h light/12 h
dark cycle and ad libitum access to standard rodent chow
diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis,
MO) and were kept in a pathogen-free environment at
