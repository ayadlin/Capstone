Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) have rapidly emerged as modulators of gene expression in cancer in which they may
have great diagnostic and therapeutic import. MicroRNA-199a-3p (miR-199a-3p) is downregulated in several
human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that miR-199a-3p targets
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and c-Met in HCC cells. Restoring attenuated levels of miR-199a3p in HCC cells led to G1-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced invasive capability, enhanced susceptibility to hypoxia, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These in vitro findings were confirmed by an
analysis of human HCC tissues, which revealed an inverse correlation linking miR-199a-3p and mTOR as well
as a shorter time to recurrence after HCC resection in patients with lower miR-199a-3p expression. These
results suggest that tactics to regulate mTOR and c-Met by elevating levels of miR-199a-3p may have therapeutic benefits in highly lethal cancers such as HCC. Cancer Res; 70(12); 5184–93. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In the recent years, great advances in the molecular characterization of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have
been reported (1, 2) and molecular pathways involved in neoplastic transformation and progression have been addressed
as targets for nonconventional treatments. Nevertheless, the
molecular classification of HCC has not been completely
assessed and HCC still confers a poor prognosis when diagnosed at advanced stages. This is partially due to the intrinsic
resistance of HCC to traditional chemotherapics, linked to
the multidrug-resistant phenotype, and to the coexistence
of the underlying chronic liver disease, which hinders the
adoption of efficacious therapeutic regimens. Furthermore,
despite apparent survival benefits (3), the efficacy of molec-

ularly targeted therapy is impaired by the activation of redundant pathways driving cell proliferation and inhibition
of apoptosis (4). Moreover, recent findings show an increased
drive toward metastatization following treatment with antiangiogenetic drugs, confirming the need to hit multiple targets at one time (5). Thus, the identification of molecular
targets for effective and nontoxic therapeutic approaches
against angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion is urgently
needed.
Evidence collected to date shows the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in cancer initiation, development, and progression, and identify this class of regulatory RNAs as
diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers, as well as additional therapeutic tools (6). Indeed, growing evidence links
miRNA deregulation to carcinogenesis in several human neoplasms, including HCC. Molecular signatures of deregulated
miRNAs have been associated with HCC clinical features,
histotype, etiology, and metastatization (7–10). MiRNAs are
small (∼22 nucleotides) RNA sequences that bind to target
RNA acting as posttranscriptional gene expression regulators. By pairing to complementary binding sites within the
3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of hundreds of target mRNAs,
miRNAs impair their translation or promote their degradation, thus participating in the control of crucial processes,
such as development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Compelling evidence underscores the ability of a
single miRNA to target multiple molecules belonging to the
same, as well as to redundant, pathways in neoplastic and
normal cells. Thus, in tumor cells, the restoration of deregulated miRNAs to physiologic levels could provide valuable information that will facilitate our understanding of miRNA
involvement in the regulation of molecular networks sustaining cancerous phenotypes.

miR-199a-3p Regulates mTOR and c-Met in HCC

Among deregulated miRNAs, the miR-199-miR-214 cluster
is of particular interest because it is downregulated in the
majority of HCCs (11), in addition to other human malignancies (12, 13), in cancer-derived cell lines (14) and in experimental neoplastic and preneoplastic conditions (15).
miR-199a-3p was linked to the modulation of different target
genes, such as c-Met (16), Smad1 (17), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; ref. 18), and its exogenous expression was
reported to reduce the motility and viability of melanoma,
gastric, and lung cancer cells (19).
Notably, with the help of a bioinformatic analysis, we
found that a key promoter of cell growth, the mammalian
target of rapamicin (mTOR), is a hypothetical target of
miR-199a-3p. The mTOR pathway is activated by multiple extracellular signals, such as growth factors, nutrients, amino
acids, hormones, and mitogens leading to the phosphorylation of the translational regulator, phospho-p70S6 kinase,
which, in turn, regulates cell proliferation, regulates protein
synthesis, and allows progression from the G1 to the S phase
of the cell cycle. The relevance of the mTOR pathway in the
carcinogenetic process is a common feature of several human cancers, including HCC (20), in which its overexpression
is associated with a poor prognosis, invasion, and metastasis
(21). The downregulation of miR-199a-3p in the majority of
HCC samples, together with the upregulation of mTOR, led
us to hypothesize a causal link between these two molecules.
In addition, a very low rate of genetic alterations affecting
mTOR pathway in HCC was recently reported (20).
The present study was undertaken to define the role of
miR-199a-3p in HCC through the identification of new target
genes, and to analyze its biological functions in HCC-derived
cell lines. Here, we identified mTOR as a target of miR-199a-3p
and we found that miR-199a-3p restoration blocks the G1-S
transition of the cell cycle, impairs invasion capability, and
sensitizes HCC cells to doxorubicin challenge. Considering
that miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p are downregulated in
the majority of HCCs, our results suggest that miR-199a-3p
restoration could be a possible therapeutic approach worthy
of evaluation in HCC.

Materials and Methods
Patients
HCC and cirrothic tissues were obtained from 39 consecutive patients (33 males and 6 females; median age, 70 y,
range, 51–82 y) who underwent liver resection for HCC at
the Department of Surgery of the University of Bologna. Normal liver tissues were obtained from 10 patients undergoing
liver surgery for traumatic lesions (8 cases) or hemangioma
resection (2 cases). Tissue samples were collected at surgery
and stored as previously described (11). Informed consent
was obtained from each patient. Histopathologic grading
was scored according to Edmondson and Steiner's criteria
(22). Exclusion criteria were a previous history of local or systemic treatments for HCC and the presence of noncirrhotic
tissue surrounding the HCC nodule/s. The characteristics of
HCC patients included in this study are described in Supplementary Table S1.

Cell culture and treatments
HepG2 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) no. HB8065] cell line was cultured with MEM (Eagle), whereas Huh7 and SNU475 (ATCC no. CRL-2236) cell lines were cultured
with RPMI 1640; both media were supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics.
Cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of rapamycin (SigmaAldrich) and collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment
for Western blotting (WB) and flow cytometry (FC) analyses.
Doxorubicin (2.5 μg/mL) was administered for 24 hours and
cells were collected for WB and FC analysis. Hypoxic conditions were created by using 250 μmol/L of Deferoxamine
(Sigma) for 24 hours before cell collection for FC Annexin
V assay.
Cell transfection with RNA oligonucleotides
HCC-derived cell lines were transfected with 100 nmol/L
of pre–miR-199a-3p, anti–miR-199a-3p, or Negative Control#1 precursor and inhibitor miRNAs (Ambion). Gene silencing was obtained by using 20 nmol/L of mTOR small
interfering RNA (siRNA; DsiRNA Duplexes, HSC.RNAI.
N004958.10.10, IDT), c-Met siRNA (Sigma-Aldrich), and
Stealth RNA Negative Control. SiRNAs sequences are reported in Supplementary Table S2. Oligonucleotide transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were
collected at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the transfection and
were stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis.
Luciferase activity assay
The portion of the 3′UTR region (908 bp) of human mTOR
gene containing the hsa-miR-199a-3p binding site was amplified by PCR using the following primers: mTOR-3′UTR-F:
5′-CTT TCT AGA AAC TGG AGG CCC AG-3′ and mTOR-3′
UTR-R: 5′-TGG TGT CTA GAC ATG GCT ACA CTT TAT
AC-3′. This portion was cloned using the XbaI site in a
pGL3 Control vector (Promega) downstream of the reporter
gene. This construct, named pGL3-mTOR, was used for transfection experiments in Huh-7 and SNU475 cells. Both cell lines
were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of
either pGL3-mTOR or pGL3 Control vector in association
with 50 ng of pRL-TK vector (Promega) and 100 nmol/L of
miR-199a-3p, anti–miR-199a-3p, or negative controls. Mutagenesis of miR-199a-3p seed sequence in the mTOR 3′UTR region was executed by Genscript Corp. (http://www.genscript.
com). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, luciferase
activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega). Each transfection was repeated twice in triplicate.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of
miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p
Accurate quantitation of mature miR-199a-3p and miR199a-5p was obtained using the Taqman MicroRNA Assays
(hsa-miR-199a-3p, N/P:4378068 and has-miR-199a-5p, N/
P:4373272, Applied Biosystems) as previously described
(11). Taqman endogenous control (RNU6B, N/P:4373381, Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize miRNAs expression
levels. Analysis of miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p expression

was carried out using the cycle threshold method. A pool of
five liver cirrhosis samples not included in this study was
used as a reference. To show that miR-199a-3p levels fell in
the linear range of the amplification assay, a standard curve
for Taqman MicroRNA Assays was generated by using serial
dilutions of the mirVana miRNA Reference Panel v9.1
(Applied Biosystems), with concentrations ranging from
1.0*10−6 to 1.0 fmol.
WB analysis
Transfected HCC-derived cell lines and primary HCC tissues were assayed with anti-mTOR, anti–phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser-240/244), anti–c-Met, anti–cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-p27 (clone 57, BD Biosciences), anti-p21 (clone F-5), and anti–β-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotecnology) antibodies. Digital images of X-ray films were
acquired and quantified with Fluor-S MultiImager (Quantityone, Bio-Rad) as previously reported (11).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed using the primers and the amplification conditions detailed in Supplementary Table S3.
Cell cycle and Annexin V assays
Transfected HCC cells were collected and fixed in 70%
ethanol at −20°C for 16 hours. FC analysis of cell cycle was performed as previously described (23), using the FACSAria cell
sorter (BD Biosciences). Detection of apoptotic cells after
doxorubicin treatment was performed by using the Annexin V/
Propidium Iodide detection kit (Bender MedSystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by FC.
Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was assessed by Boyden blind-well chambers
(New Technologies Group) containing poly-vinyl-pyrrolidone–free polycarbonate filters, 8-μm pore size coated with
Matrigel (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after the transfection,
5.0 × 104 HepG2 and 3.0 × 104 SNU475 cells were resuspended
in serum-free medium and added to the upper chamber. A
medium supplemented with 30% FBS was used as chemoattractant to the lower chamber. HepG2 and SNU475 cells were
incubated at 37°C for 48 and 24 hours, respectively, and non-

invading cells were removed with cotton swabs. Invasive cells
were fixed, stained with Giemsa (Sigma), and counted.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were tested using paired or
unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA as appropriate. Pearson's
correlation coefficient, or paired or unpaired Student's t test
were used to explore any relationship between miR-199a-3p
expression and tumor characteristics including α-fetoprotein
(AFP) serum levels, tumor size, grade, etiology, and focality.
Patients survival and time to recurrence (TTR) curves based
on miR-199a-3p levels were computed by Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method and compared using a log-rank test.
Reported P values were two sided and were considered significant when lower than 0.05. Statistical calculations were
performed using SPSS version 8.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
mTOR is a target of miR-199a-3p
A bioinformatic analysis identified mTOR as a hypothetical target gene of miR-199a-3p, as identified by MICROCOSM, Pictar, and TargetScan (Table 1) alghorithms. A
further hint for the potential role of miR-199a-3p in the regulation of mTOR expression came from the analysis of three
different HCC-derived cell lines (Huh-7, HepG2, and SNU475)
that showed an inverse correlation between miR-199a-3p levels and mTOR protein (Fig. 1A and B). Conversely, no correlation was observed between miR-199a-3p and mTOR
mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). To show that miR-199a-3p participates to the regulation of mTOR expression, we performed
an in vitro functional analysis by either restoring or silencing
miR-199a-3p. HepG2 and Huh-7 cell lines were chosen for
the enforced expression of miR-199a-3p because they display
the lowest constitutive levels of this miRNA and a high
mTOR protein expression (Fig. 1A and B). The enforced expression of miR-199a-3p in HCC-derived cell lines at levels
similar to those observed in normal liver tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1) led to a decrease of mTOR protein, without any
variation in mTOR mRNA levels (Fig. 2A and B). To investigate the potential effect of the restored expression of miR199a-3p to the mTOR downstream pathway, we analyzed
the phosphorylation status of the ribosomal protein S6, a

Taken together, these findings showed a direct interaction
between miR-199a-3p and mTOR mRNA in HCC-derived
cell lines.

target of the p70-S6K protein kinase. miR-199a-3p transfection determined a downregulation of phosphorylated-S6 protein both in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2A and B).
SNU475 cells were chosen for miR-199a-3p silencing because they express the highest miR-199a-3p basal levels associated with low mTOR protein levels (Fig. 1A and B). The
inhibition of miR-199a-3p in SNU475 cells determined an increase of both mTOR and P-S6 proteins, with no variations in
the mRNA level (Fig. 2C). These data suggested a posttranscriptional regulation of mTOR by miR-199a-3p in HCCderived cell lines.
To prove a direct interaction between miR-199a-3p and its
binding site within mTOR mRNA, pGL3-mTOR vector was
cotransfected in Huh-7 and SNU475 cells in association with
miR-199a-3p, anti–miR-199a-3p, or negative controls and
then assayed by a luciferase reporter. The choice of these cell
lines was intended to obtain the greatest variations upon
miR-199a-3p modulation. Huh-7 cells transfected with
pGL3-mTOR vector showed a 1.3-fold decrease of the luciferase activity when cotransfected with miR-199a-3p (t test, P =
0.03). Similarly, SNU475 cells transfected with pGL3-mTOR
vector displayed a 3.0-fold increase of the luciferase activity
when cotransfected with anti–miR-199a-3p (t test, P = 0.006;

the cloned mTOR 3′UTR region to generate pGL3-mTORm1 vector. No significant change of the luciferase activity

miR-199a-3p affects cell cycle of HCC-derived cell lines
To analyze the role of miR-199a-3p in cell cycle regulation, we restored miR-199a-3p expression in HepG2 cells
and evaluated the cell distribution through the cell cycle.
An increase in the G1-phase population and a decrease of
the S phase followed the restoration in miR-199a-3p expression. Accordingly, miR-199a-3p restoration determined an
upregulation of two crucial cell cycle inhibitors, CDKN1A/
p21 and CDKN1B/p27, at both protein and mRNA levels
(Fig. 3A).
It has been recently reported that c-Met proto-oncogene is
a direct target of miR-199a-3p in melanoma cells and gastric
and lung cancer cells (16). This downregulation affects cell
proliferation, motility, and invasive capability. To discriminate which of the miR-199a-3p targets, mTOR or c-Met,
mostly contributes to the regulation of cell cycle, we silenced
both genes by transfecting HepG2 cells with miR-199a-3p or
specific siRNAs (Fig. 3A–C). The transfection of HepG2 cells
with either mTOR or c-Met siRNAs determined an arrest in
the G1 phase. Moreover, and similarly to miR-199a-3p restoration, mTOR and c-Met silencing determined an increase of
CDKN1B/p27 expression at both mRNA and protein levels.
miR-199a-3p restoration and c-Met silencing also determined
an increase in CDKN1A/p21 expression, whereas mTOR
silencing determined a decrease of CDKN1A/p21 levels
(Fig. 3B and C).
To compare our findings with those reported in the literature (24), we blocked mTOR pathway by treating HepG2
cells with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This treatment
determined an arrest of cell cycle in the G1 phase, similar
to that observed after miR-199a-3p restoration, and prevented the phosphorylation of the ribosomal subunit S6
(Fig. 4A). Again, following rapamycin treatment, a decrease
of CDKN1A/p21 expression was observed in HepG2 cells. To
further investigate miR-199a-3p target contribution to cell
cycle regulation, miR-199a-3p silencing was performed in
SNU475 cells followed by mTOR or c-Met siRNAs–mediated
inhibition. In line with our previous findings, fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis revealed that a reduction of
G1 phase occurred in SNU475 cells after miR-199a-3p silencing (Fig. 4B). Notably, both mTOR and c-Met silencing
in anti-miR-199a-3p–transfected cells partially rescued the
phenotype induced by anti-miR-199a-3p transfection, with
an increase of the G1 phase (Fig. 4C). Taken together,
these data showed that miR-199a-3p contributes to the cell
cycle modulation of HCC cells by silencing both mTOR
and c-Met.

liver with a corresponding 1.9- and 9.1-fold decrease of mTOR and P-S6 protein levels, respectively, when compared with negative control (NC)–transfected
cells. No decrease of mTOR mRNA was observed in transfected cells. B, transfection of miR-199a-3p in Huh-7 cells increased its expression to levels
comparable with normal liver with a corresponding 1.4- and 1.3-fold decrease of mTOR and P-S6 protein levels, respectively, without any modification in the
mRNA level. C, transfection of anti–miR-199a-3p (AM) in SNU475 determined an 18-fold decrease of miR-199a-3p expression (t test, P = 0.01) and a
4.5- and 2.8-fold increase of mTOR and P-S6 protein expression, respectively. No modifications were observed in the mRNA level. D, luciferase assay in

activity when coadministered with doxorubicin (25). Therefore, we investigated whether miR-199a-3p restoration and/
or mTOR and c-Met silencing might modulate doxorubicininduced apoptotic cell death. Because rapamycin analogues
trigger apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (26), we assayed HepG2 cells that express wild-type p53. Following
doxorubicin treatment, flow cytometric analysis for Annexin
V–positive cells revealed an increase of apoptosis upon miR199a-3p restoration. Similarly, an increase of apoptotic cells
was observed in either mTOR- or c-Met–silenced cells, with
the highest increase found in mTOR-silenced cells (Fig. 5A).
As a further proof, an increase of the cleaved fragments of
caspase-3 was observed in miR-199a-3p–transfected and

mTOR–knocked down cells. Moreover, an upregulation of
Puma mRNA, assessed as a p53 transcriptional target, was
observed following miR-199a-3p restoration and mTOR/
c-Met silencing (Fig. 5B). These data showed that miR-199a3p increases doxorubicin sensitivity of HCC cells to a similar
extent of mTOR siRNAs. This increased is, at least in part,
mediated by the activation of the caspase cascade.
Because it is known that the mTOR pathway enhances
HIF-1α stability under hypoxic conditions (27) and that
miR-199a-5p directly regulates HIF-1α expression (28), we
tested whether the restoration of miR-199a-3p or miR-199a5p in HepG2 cells would modify their susceptibility to hypoxia.
FC analysis showed an increase of apoptotic cell death for

both miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p–transfected cells maintained in hypoxia-mimetic conditions (Fig. 5C).
miR-199a-3p affects the invasion capability of
HCC-derived cell lines
The role of miR-199a-3p and of its target genes in the modulation of the invasion capability was investigated by Matrigel invasion assay. The restoration of miR-199a-3p in HepG2
cells caused a 60% decrease of the invasive potential, overcoming the effects of mTOR and c-Met silencing (20% and
40% decrease, respectively). Accordingly, a 2.2-fold increase
of invading cells was observed following miR-199a-3p silenc-

ing in SNU475 cells (Fig. 5D). These findings showed that
miR-199a-3p counteract the invasive potential of HCC cells,
even if this event is not likely related to mTOR inhibition.
Expression of miR-199a-3p and mTOR in HCC tissues
and correlation with clinicopathologic variables
Based on our previous findings obtained with microarray
analysis (11), real-time RT-PCR was used to assess miR-199a
expression in 10 normal livers and 39 matched HCC and cirrhotic tissues. A significant downregulation of both miR-199a3p and miR-199a-5p expression was observed in HCC tissues
when compared with cirrhotic ones (Fig. 6A and B) and

normal liver (ANOVA: P = 0.0009), whereas mTOR upregulation was observed in 23 of 39 HCCs. Subsequent analyses were
carried out with miR-199a-3p because it modulates mTOR
and c-Met. An inverse correlation between miR-199a-3p and
mTOR protein expression in HCC samples (Pearson's correlation: P < 0.0001) is shown in Fig. 6C. No association was found
between miR-199a-3p expression and serum AFP, tumor size,
focality, grading, and etiology of the liver disease. Because
HCC recurrences occurring within 2 years after surgery are
considered as true recurrences due to a “seeded field” (29),
TTR within this time frame was compared in patients with different miR-199a-3p expression. A shorter TTR was associated
with lower miR-199a-3p values (log-rank test, P = 0.04; Fig. 6D),
whereas no association was identified with patients survival.

Discussion
Human miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p are processed from
the same precursor, hsa-miR-199a, and are downregulated in
several human cancers, including HCC (7, 12, 13). It was recently
reported that miR-199a-3p regulates c-Met proto-oncogene and
inhibits the “invasive growth” program when transfected in cancer cells other than HCC (16). In this study, we showed that an
important function of miR-199a-3p is to repress the translation
of mTOR and c-Met in HCC cells. In addition, we showed that
miR-199a-3p contributes to the modulation of cell cycle, invasiveness, and sensitizes HCC cells to doxorubicin treatment
and to hypoxia-induced apoptosis.

The serine/threonine kinase mTOR plays a key role in cell
growth, protein translation, metabolism, cell invasion, and
apoptosis (30). The mTOR pathway turned out to be implicated in the initiation and progression of several cancers, including HCC, and is therefore a promising therapeutic target,
the potential of which is under clinical investigation (20, 31).
Recent reports identified c-Met, Smad1, and LIF (16–18) as
miR-199a-3p targets. In addition, among genes with oncogenic functions, SEMA3A, ErbB4, ZEB1, ZEB2, and ITGB8 are
predicted as putative, but not yet ascertained, miR-199a-3p
targets. Conversely, c-Met plays a well-defined role in hepatocarcinogenesis (32–34) and was previously confirmed as a
miR-199a-3p target. Therefore, here, we investigated to what
extent miR-199a-3p contributes to the HCC phenotype by inhibiting mTOR or c-Met.
Cell cycle modulation by miR-199a-3p, resulted in increased G1 and decreased S phases, though at less impressive
levels than mTOR or c-Met silencing by siRNAs. These findings might be explained by considering the lower inhibition
of mTOR and c-Met obtained by miR-199a-3p with respect to
the more specific siRNAs. Indeed, because of their physiologic role and intrinsic nature, miRNAs regulate multiple targets
and pathways, partitioning their inhibitory effect within the
cell, which makes their effects difficult to be compared with
the nearly total silencing of a single gene. Notably, in our
experiments, we transfected cell lines with miR-199a-3p concentrations, mimicking those observed in normal liver tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

miR-199a-3p Regulates mTOR and c-Met in HCC

To gain a further insight into the mechanisms involved in
the miR-199a-3p cell cycle modulation, we found an upregulation of CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27 upon its restored
expression. The same effect was determined by mTOR and
c-Met silencing by siRNAs, except for CDKN1A/p21 downregulation upon mTOR-specific silencing. Indeed, only
CDKN1A/p21 mRNA was upregulated, whereas the protein
appeared downregulated. In line with our data, the inhibition
of CDKN1A/p21 translation by mTOR has been reported in
tumors other than HCC (35, 36). About cell cycle regulation,
Li and colleagues (34) reported that c-Met silencing had no
effect on the cell cycle of HepG2 cells. We can speculate that
the discrepancy with our findings might be due to different
experimental settings, such as cell confluence that indeed
seems to have a fundamental role in the regulation of
CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27 through the hepatocyte
growth factor/c-MET axis (37).
It was previously reported that mTOR inhibition by temserolimus increases the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
agents through the downregulation and the accelerated deg-

radation of CDKN1A/p21, which is thought to lower the apoptotic threshold to DNA damage (25, 38). Accordingly, we
observed an increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in terms
of apoptotic cell death upon both miR-199a-3p restoration
and mTOR silencing, whereas the contribution of c-Met
turned out to be marginal.
C-Met proto-oncogene is involved in a complex biological
program named “invasive growth” that results from stimulation of cell motility, invasion, and protection from apoptosis
(39). It has been previously reported that c-Met is downregulated by miR-199a-3p in several cancer cells other than HCC
(16). Here, we report the role of miR-199a-3p in the modulation of the invasion capability of HCC cells through c-Met
inhibition. HepG2 cells transfected with miR-199a-3p, as well
as c-Met siRNAs, display a decreased invasion capability and
in this experimental setting, miR-199a-3p seems to be more
effective than inhibition of c-Met, whereas mTOR silencing
does not affect the invasion capability of HepG2 cells. Accordingly, SNU475 cells, constitutively expressing high miR199a-3p levels, displayed a higher invasion capability upon

Figure 5. MiR-199a-3p affects doxorubicin sensitivity, growth in hypoxic conditions, and cell invasion. A, FC Annexin V assay in transfected HepG2 cells
following doxorubicin treatment. A 2.5- and 3.0-fold increase in Annexin V–positive cells was observed in miR-199a-3p–transfected and mTOR-silenced
cells, respectively (t test, P = 0.005) when compared with negative controls. A 1.6-fold increase in apoptotic cells was observed in c-Met–silenced cells
(t test, P = 0.03). B, WB analysis of the cleaved caspase-3 in HepG2 cells transfected with miR-199a-3p, mTOR, and c-Met siRNAs following doxorubicin
challenge. Cleaved caspase-3 fragments were upregulated in miR-199a-3p–transfected and mTOR-silenced cells. RT-PCR analysis of HepG2 cells
displayed an increase of Puma expression following miR-199a-3p transfection or mTOR/c-Met silencing. C, FC Annexin V assay in transfected HepG2 cells
following deferoxamine treatment. A 2.3- and 1.6-fold increase in Annexin V–positive cells was observed in miR-199a-3p– and miR-199a-5p–transfected
cells, respectively (t test, P = 0.006 and 0.03). D, HepG2 cells transfected with miR-199a-3p, mTOR, c-Met siRNAs, or negative controls (NC and
Scramble) were tested by the Matrigel invasion assay. A significant reduction of invading cells was observed in miR-199a-3p– and c-Met siRNA–transfected
cells (t test, P = 0.009 and 0.017), but not in mTOR-silenced cells (t test, P = 0.15). SNU475 cells were transfected with anti–miR-199a-3p or miRNA
inhibitor negative controls (NCi) and then assayed by the Matrigel invasion assay. A significant increase of invading cell number was observed following
miR-199a-3p silencing (t test, P = 0.0005). Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05 at paired t test.

analysis by Kaplan-Meier survival curves exhibits a higher recurrence rate in HCC patients with lower miR-199a-3p tissue levels (categorized on the basis of
the median value).

miR-199a-3p inhibition. The involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in the invasion process was analyzed by
zymography assay in transfected cells (data not shown).
MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased in c-Met–silenced HepG2
cells, but not in miR-199a-3p–transfected cells, suggesting
c-Met as a major activator of MMPs. The higher invasion capability observed upon miR-199a-3p inhibition let us hypothesize the regulation of multiple targets, beside c-Met, as well
as the involvement of other mechanisms different from
MMPs modulation.
To confirm the relevance of our in vitro findings, we identified an inverse correlation between miR-199a-3p expression
and mTOR protein levels in human HCC samples. Notably, a
shorter time to recurrence was observed in patients with
lower miR-199a-3p levels. These findings further suggest that
miR-199a-3p may influence the invasion capability in vitro, as
well as in vivo.
In conclusion, our findings emphasize the role of miR199a-3p as a modulator of cell cycle, invasion capability,
and response to doxorubicin treatment. The identification

5192

Cancer Res; 70(12) June 15, 2010

of mTOR and c-Met among miR-199a-3p targets further emphasizes the roles of this miRNA in HCC.
The regulation of multiple, key, cancer-associated pathways by miR-199a-3p in HCC cells emphasizes out the importance of its replacement and offers the theoretical possibility
to counteract the malignant phenotype. Moreover, endogenous and nontoxic molecules such as miRNAs analogues
might represent a promising tool for cancer gene therapy
(40), particularly when combined with doxorubicin.
