Abstract
Stem cells have been isolated by their ability to efflux Hoechst
33342 dye and are referred to as the ‘‘side population’’ (SP). In
this study, we used flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 dye efflux
assay to isolate and characterize SP cells from six human lung
cancer cell lines (H460, H23, HTB-58, A549, H441, and H2170).
Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency xenograft experiments showed that SP cells were enriched in tumorinitiating capability compared with non-SP cells. Matrigel
invasion assay showed that SP cells also have higher potential
for invasiveness. Further characterization of this SP phenotype
revealed several stem cell properties. We found evidence for
repopulating ability by SP to regenerate a population resembling the original population. SP displayed elevated expression
of ABCG2 as well as other ATP-binding cassette transporters
and showed resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs.
Human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression was higher
in the SP, suggesting that this fraction may represent a reservoir
with unlimited proliferative potential for generating cancer
cells. mRNA levels of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 7,
a member of the MCM family of proteins critical to the DNA
replication complex, were lower in SP cells, suggesting that a
majority of the SP fraction was in the G0 quiescent state. Sixteen
clinical lung cancer samples also displayed a smaller but
persistent SP population. These findings indicate that SP is an
enriched source of lung tumor–initiating cells with stem cell
properties and may be an important target for effective therapy
and a useful tool to investigate the tumorigenic process. [Cancer

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the
world today (1). Currently, lung cancer survival is poor with only
15% of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis. Although new
chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy have improved survival and
quality of life of patients, the overall effect in the last decade has
been mainly on palliation rather than reduction in mortality.
Evidence is accumulating that solid tumors, such as brain and
breast cancer, contain a minor population of ‘‘cancer stem cells’’

that have high repopulation capacity (2, 3), a model that is already
well established in hematopoietic malignancy (4). In vitro data have
shown that only 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 lung cancer cells forms colonies
in soft agar assay, indicating that not every lung cancer cell is
capable of tumor initiation (5). Recent data from a mouse model
reinforce the notion that lung adenocarcinoma arises from stem
cells in the terminal bronchioles (6). Hence, it is likely that human
lung cancers have rare stem-like cancer-initiating cells within the
tumor.
Previous studies have shown that adult stem cells can be
identified by a side population (SP) phenotype. The SP, first
described by Goodell et al. (7), is a small subpopulation of cells with
enriched stem cell activity that shows a distinct ‘‘low’’ Hoechst
33342 dye staining pattern. Later studies attributed this phenotype
to expression of ABCG2, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
(8). Concurrent studies have shown SP cells in human cancers of
different origins, including acute myelogenous leukemia, neuroblastoma, and glioma (9–12). These studies have suggested that the
SP may be a source of cancer stem cells. If this is also the case in
human lung cancer, it may be an important target for effective
therapy for this disease.
The present study was undertaken to identify the SP in
established human lung cancer cell lines maintained in long-term
culture. We hypothesize that these cells represent an enriched
fraction of tumor-initiating cells. Here, we report the presence of
this small, distinct population in lung cancer cell lines that shows
higher tumorigenicity in vivo and invasion in vitro compared with
non-SP cells. They also exhibit several cancer stem cell properties,
including high telomerase activity, quiescence, regeneration of both
SP and non-SP, presence of ABC transporters, and multidrug
resistance (MDR). Furthermore, a similar SP population was also
found in 16 clinical lung cancer samples, raising important
therapeutic implications.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and clinical samples. Human tumor cell lines A549, H23,
H460, HTB-58, H2170, and H441 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in culture medium recommended by ATCC. All media were supplemented with 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen-Life Technologies). All cell lines were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37jC
supplied with 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were routinely maintained in 75 cm2
tissue culture flasks (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware) and harvested by
0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) treatment when they were in
logarithmic phase of growth for SP analysis. Sixteen non–small cell lung
cancers were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection after
informed consent. Briefly, fresh tumor samples obtained within 60 min of
surgery were rinsed, mechanically minced, and digested for 4 h at 37jC in a
shaking incubator with 0.1 Wünsch units/mL collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) in DMEM. The digest was further disaggregated through an 18.5gauge needle and sieved through a 100-Am cell strainer to obtain single cell
suspension. The single cell suspension was layered onto a 70% and 40%

Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged for 20 min at
25,000 rpm, room temperature, and with no brake. Epithelial cells from the
70%/40% interface were then collected for SP analysis. Cell viability was
determined by trypan blue exclusion.
SP analysis. The cell suspensions were labeled with Hoechst 33342 dye
(Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) using the methods described by Goodell
et al. (7) with modifications. Briefly, cells were resuspended at 1  106/mL
in prewarmed DMEM (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) with 2% FCS
(Invitrogen-Life Technologies) and 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer (InvitrogenLife Technologies). Hoechst 33342 dye was added at a final concentration of
5 Ag/mL in the presence or absence of reserpine (50 Amol/L; Sigma) and the
cells were incubated at 37jC for 90 min with intermittent shaking. At the
end of the incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS
(Invitrogen-Life Technologies) with 2% FCS and 10 mmol/L HEPES,
centrifuged down at 4jC, and resuspended in ice-cold HBSS containing
2% FCS and 10 mmol/L HEPES. Propidium iodide (Molecular ProbesInvitrogen) at a final concentration of 2 Ag/mL was added to the cells to
gate viable cells. The cells were filtered through a 40-Am cell strainer to
obtain single cell suspension before sorting. Analyses and sorting were
done on a FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson). The Hoechst 33342 dye
was excited at 357 nm and its fluorescence was dual-wavelength analyzed
(blue, 402–446 nm; red, 650–670 nm).
Tumor cell implantation experiments. In vivo experiments were done
in accordance with the institutional guidelines for the use of laboratory
animals. SP and non-SP cells from H460 A549 and H441 were s.c. injected
into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID)
mice using a limiting dilution assay. Groups of mice were inoculated with SP
cells at 1  105, 5  104, 5  103, and 1  103 or non-SP cells at 1  105, 5 
104, and 5  103 (three to four mice per group). Tumor growth was
monitored every 2 days after second week of inoculation. The mice were
sacrificed at day 60 or when the tumors grow to a maximum of 1,000 mm3.
Tumor volume was calculated by the formula 0.52  length  width2. Fold
difference in tumorigenicity was calculated by the following formula:
(minimum number of non-SP cells needed to generate a tumor) / (minimum
number of SP cells needed to generate a tumor). The tumors were surgically
removed and digested in 0.1 Wünsch units/mL collagenase according to the
manufacturer’s instructions before reanalysis by the Hoechst 33342 dye
efflux assay as described above.
Invasion assay. Cellular potential for invasiveness of SP and non-SP cells
was determined using six-well Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences
Discovery Labware). Cells were seeded into upper inserts at 2  105 per
insert in serum-free DMEM. Outer wells were filled with DMEM containing
5% FBS as chemoattractant. Cells were incubated at 37jC with 5% carbon
dioxide for 48 h, and then noninvading cells were removed by swabbing top
layer of Matrigel with Q-tip. Membrane containing invading cells was
stained with hematoxylin for 3 min, washed, and mounted on slides. The
entire membrane with invading cells was counted under light microscope at
40 objective.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis. Cells were harvested and
total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA
was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and subsequently reverse transcribed
using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase enzyme
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR
was done with SYBR Green Real-Time Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions on the ABI Prism 7900
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed to
generate a PCR product of <200 bp. Each 15 AL PCR contained 1.5 AL
diluted cDNA (24 ng starting total RNA). Thermal cycling conditions were
50jC for 2 min and 95jC for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95jC, 30 s
at 58jC, and 30 s at 72jC. Levels of expression were normalized to the
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene.
Drug sensitivity assay. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)sorted cells were counted by the trypan blue assay for viability and seeded
in 96-well plate format with appropriate growth medium at 100 AL per well.
After 24 h of recovery, chemotherapeutic drugs (British Columbia Cancer
Agency Pharmacy) were added at the IC50 concentration for each unsorted
cell line (see Supplementary Table S1) and incubated for another 24 h.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

Sensitivity was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt
(MTS) cell proliferation assay [CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS), Promega] according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, 20 AL of substrate solution were added to cells and
incubated for 2 h at 37jC. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm for each
well using a microplate reader (Dynex Technology). Drug resistance was
represented as % viability calculated using the following formula:
(absorbance of treated cells) / (absorbance of untreated cells)  100%.
Multiple staining analysis. Cells were first stained with the Hoechst
33342 dye for 90 min as described above. Hoechst-stained cells were
centrifuged and resuspended in HFN (HBSS + 2% FCS + 0.05% NaN3) + 5%
human serum at a concentration of 5  104 to 7  104 per AL. Cells were
costained with CD34-allophycocyanin (APC; BD Biosciences) and nestinphycoerythrin (PE; Cedarlane Labs) antibodies or with CD24-PE (BD
Biosciences) and CD44-APC (BD Biosciences) antibodies at 10 AL per 1 
106 cells. After incubation in the dark for 30 min on ice, 1 mL HFN was
added to each tube and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended in 300 AL HFN
with 2 Ag/mL propidium iodide and analyzed using FACS. Staining profile
for each marker was constructed within the SP and non-SP gates separately
and compared.
Statistical analysis. Data were presented as the mean F SD. To assess
statistical significance of differences, an unpaired t test (GraphPad Software,
Inc.) was done. P values <0.05 were considered significant as indicated by
asterisks.

Results
SP phenotype is observed in human cancer cell lines. We
examined the existence of SPs in six human lung cancer cell lines
(see Materials and Methods) by staining them with Hoechst 33342
dye to generate a Hoechst blue-red profile. As a control, reserpine
was added to block the activity of Hoechst 33342 transporter, and
the SP gate was defined as the diminished region in the presence of
reserpine. The profile of H460 was shown as an example (Fig. 1A).
All the lung cancer cell lines contained a distinct fraction of SP
cells, ranging from 1.5% (H23) to 6.1% (H441) of gated cells, which
decreased significantly in the presence of reserpine (Fig. 1B).
SP regenerates both SP and non-SP. To compare the
repopulation ability of lung cancer SP cells with non-SP cells, we
cultured the sorted SP and non-SP cells separately under the same
culture condition for 2 weeks before they were restained with
Hoechst 33342 dye and reanalyzed. Both fractions were viable in
culture, but the SP cells generated both a SP and a non-SP with a
fraction size comparable with the original population, whereas the
non-SP cells produced mainly non-SP cells (Fig. 1C and D).
SP cells are more tumorigenic in vivo. To test whether SP cells
are enriched for tumorigenic cells, various numbers of SP and nonSP cells from H460, A549, and H441, cell lines known to give rise to
tumors in vivo, were s.c. injected into mice and monitored for
tumor development. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2A, H460 non-SP
cells give rise to new tumors at 1  105 in only one of four mice
tested. However, SP cells could form a tumor when only 5  104
cells (three of three animals) were inoculated, suggesting that H460
SP was enriched for tumor-initiating cells by at least 2-fold.
This enrichment-fold is likely an underestimation because, at the
same injection dose (1  105 cells), the tumor generated by the SP
(1,350 mm3) is 15-fold larger in volume than that of the non-SP
(88 mm3). For A549, SP cells gave rise to tumors with as little as
1  103 cells (two of four animals), whereas at least 5  104 non-SP
cells were needed to form a tumor (three of four animals). Hence,
A549 SP was significantly enriched for tumorigenic cells by f50-fold.
H441 SP cells generated a tumor with 5  103 cells compared with

of SP-derived tumors by flow cytometry showed that, similar to SP
cultured in vitro, SP cells under in vivo conditions also have the
capacity to regenerate the SP and non-SP fractions (Fig. 2B).

in vitro Matrigel invasion assay was done on sorted cells of each
cell line. Figure 2C shows that SP cells of H460, A549, HTB-58,
H441, and H2170 are all significantly more invasive than the nonSP cells.
ABC transporters are up-regulated in SP cells. Expression of
ABC transporters has been shown in primitive cells and associated
with its capacity to export a broad range of cytotoxic drugs
(reviewed in ref. 13). In particular, ABCG2 has been implicated in
the high Hoechst 33342 dye efflux capacity that marks the SP
phenotype. Using a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
assay, we determined the relative mRNA expression level of human
ABC transporters in the SP and non-SP of lung cancer cell lines.
Twelve ABC transporters were studied, including the four major
drug transporters (ABCA2, MDR1, MRP1, and ABCG2) and related
subfamily members (MRP2-MRP9). Consistent with previous
reports, ABCG2 was elevated in the SP of all cell lines (Fig. 3A).
In addition, the SP fraction expressed other drug transporters at a
significantly higher level than the non-SP in H460 (ABCA2, MDR1,
and MRP1), A549 (ABCA2 and MRP1), HTB-58 (ABCA2, MDR1, and
MRP1), H441 (MDR1), and H2170 (MDR1 and MRP1; Fig. 3B–D).
Several related subfamily members were also found in higher levels
in the SP (Supplementary Fig. S1).
SP cells show higher resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.

and cancer stem cells, we tested whether the SP show heightened
resistance to drugs commonly used in chemotherapy. We did
sensitivity assays of seven chemotherapeutic drugs on SP and nonSP cells of H460, HTB-58, H2170, and H441 (both populations of
these cell lines recovered in the first 24 h to yield reliable results).
Table 2 shows that the SP of all cell lines exhibited higher resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs than non-SP. In particular, SP was
resistant to all seven drugs tested for H460; to cisplatin and
etoposide for HTB-58; to etoposide, gemcitabine, doxorubicin,
and daunorubicin for H2170; and to etoposide, vinorelbine, and
docetaxel for H441.
Human telomerase reverse transcriptase level is elevated in
SP cells. To elucidate possible differences in telomerase expression
between SP and non-SP, mRNA levels of human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase and
limiting factor for telomerase activity, were measured and
compared. As shown in Fig. 3E, hTERT expression was higher in
SP cells for all cell lines tested.
Minichromosome maintenance 7 expression is lower in the
SP fraction. Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are
essential components of the replication helicase complex. They are
useful markers that reflect the cell cycle state (14). We report here
that the SP showed lower mRNA expression levels of MCM7, a
member of the MCM family and a proliferation marker, in all cell
lines tested (Fig. 3F).

Staining of SP cells for other putative stem cell markers. To
elucidate on the possible association of other putative stem cell
markers to the SP phenotype, cell lines stained by the Hoechst
33342 dye were additionally stained for CD24, CD34, CD44, and
nestin. We found no significant difference between the SP and nonSP for each individual marker (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S2).
SP is present in clinical lung cancer samples. To see if clinical
samples also contain the SP, we stained 16 surgical resections from
lung cancer patients with Hoechst 33342 dye for FACS analysis. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, all samples tested showed a small SP (0.03–
1.12%), showing the presence of this population in clinical lung
cancer similar to lung cancer cell lines.

Discussion
Our present study is in keeping with literature supporting the
existence of a SP, the fraction enriched for stem cells in long-term
cancer cell culture. We showed that the SP could be reliably
detected under the experimental conditions used. When injected
into NOD/SCID mice, SP cells were found to be more tumorigenic
than non-SP, which forms the majority of cells, thus indicating a
significant enrichment of tumor-initiating cells in this small
subpopulation. This is potentially important because effective
curative therapy most likely depends on successful eradication of

these cancer-initiating cells. As observed by other investigators
(9, 10), we also found both in vitro and in vivo evidence for the SP
to regenerate a population of cells composed of both SP and nonSP, resembling the original unsorted population, thus showing
repopulating capacities similar to stem cells. Moreover, our finding
that lung cancer SP cells were more invasive than non-SP suggests
that ‘‘stemness’’ may be related to invasiveness. Likely, there exists a
population of stem-like cells within a lung tumor that is involved in
the initiation of invasion.
Consistent with studies that show ABCG2 to be a molecular
determinant of the SP phenotype (8), expression of ABCG2 mRNA
was markedly higher in SP for all lung cancer cell lines analyzed.
Interestingly, our results also revealed that the SP had elevated
levels of other members of the ABC transporter family, including
ABCA2, MDR1, and MRP1 (and related subfamily members MRP2
to MRP9 that are potential drug pumps), which are known to

export different chemotherapeutic drugs and associate with drug
resistance (13). Given that stem cells often display higher tolerance
to cytotoxins (15), it is reasonable that SP cells in lung cancer also
turn on several MDR genes as protective mechanisms. In support
of this, we found that SP cells showed increased resistance to
multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, several of which, notably
cisplatin, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine, are commonly used as
first-line therapy for lung cancer. Because different ABC transporters show overlapping yet different substrate specificity, the
combination of these likely accounts for the range of drug
resistance observed in the SP.
In this study, we found that expression levels of hTERT were
elevated in SP cells from all cell lines tested. This is consistent with
the work of Alvi et al. (16) that showed elevated hTERT level in the
SP of normal mammary epithelium. In lung cancer, telomerase is
expressed early in the multistage process and has been implicated

in malignant transformation and tumor invasion. Furthermore,
telomerase is a crucial marker of cellular immortalization in
cancers (17). According to the cancer stem cell model, cancers
likely have a subpopulation with indefinite repopulation potential.
Thus, with its increased hTERT expression, the lung cancer SP may
represent such a reservoir for generating cancer cells, driving
cancer cell immortalization and disease progression. As proposed
by previous studies, this telomerase expression in cancer stem cells
may be inherited from their normal stem cell counterpart and is
progressively lost during differentiation and maturation (18, 19).
MCM7 is an essential component of the replication helicase
complex required for DNA replication. Its expression is required
during the cell cycle, but in quiescent cells (G0) it is found to be
absent (14). Hence, it is a useful biomarker for proliferation. Here,
we report that MCM7 expression was lower in the SP fraction,
suggesting that SP cells are mainly outside of the active cell cycle.
This is consistent with the concept that stem cells are mostly in the
quiescent state (15).
In conclusion, our studies showed that it is possible to define
and isolate an enriched tumor-initiating population in lung cancer
using the SP phenotype. The cell lines investigated in this study
contain SP cells that are significantly enriched for tumorigenicity
and invasiveness. They also possess stem cell properties of MDR,
high telomerase activity, repopulating capacity, and quiescence.
Although the SP does not necessarily represent 100% pure cancer
stem cells or all of the malignant stem cells from the whole
population, it is a significant enrichment of these rare cells

responsible for initiating and maintaining cancer. Because other
potential stem cell markers, including CD23, CD34, CD44, and
nestin, did not associate with Hoechst-dim cells, they cannot
replace the Hoechst 33342 efflux assay in isolating lung cancer
stem-like cells. Thus, the distinct SP phenotype currently provides
an attractive testing model for studying lung cancer–initiating cell
biology.
We report the existence of a similar small SP fraction, as defined
by the Hoechst 33342 dye efflux assay, in 16 human clinical lung
cancer samples. We propose that these SP cells also exhibit
characteristics of a tumor-initiating, cancer stem cell phenotype.
The presence of such a population with both high tumorigenic
potential and drug resistance can have important clinical
implications in lung cancer treatment. These rare cells have the
potential to survive conventional chemotherapy and regenerate a
cancer population, leading to relapse. Hence, the SP may represent
both a useful predictor of treatment response and target for
effective treatment. Future work will extend this characterization
from human lung cancer cell lines into clinical specimens,
potentially identifying important targets for therapy.
