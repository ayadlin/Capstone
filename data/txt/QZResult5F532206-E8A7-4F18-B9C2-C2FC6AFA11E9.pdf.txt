Abstract
DNA-damaging anticancer drugs remain a part of metastatic
melanoma therapy. Epigenetic reprogramming caused by
increased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity arising during
tumor formation may contribute to resistance of melanomas
to the alkylating drugs temozolomide, dacarbazine, and fotemustine. Here, we report on the impact of class I HDACs on
the response of malignant melanoma cells treated with alkylating agents. The data show that malignant melanomas in situ
contain a high level of HDAC1/2 and malignant melanoma
cells overexpress HDAC1/2/3 compared with noncancer cells.
Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of class I HDACs sensitizes malignant melanoma cells to apoptosis following exposure to alkylating agents, while not affecting primary melanocytes. Inhibition of HDAC1/2/3 caused sensitization of melanoma cells to temozolomide in vitro and in melanoma

xenografts in vivo. HDAC1/2/3 inhibition resulted in suppression of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination because of downregulation of RAD51
and FANCD2. This sensitized cells to the cytotoxic DNA lesion
O6-methylguanine and caused a synthetic lethal interaction
with the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib. Furthermore, knockdown
experiments identiﬁed HDAC2 as being responsible for the
regulation of RAD51. The inﬂuence of class I HDACs on
DSB repair by homologous recombination and the possible
clinical implication on malignant melanoma therapy with
temozolomide and other alkylating drugs suggests a combination approach where class I HDAC inhibitors such as
valproic acid or MS-275 (entinostat) appear to counteract
HDAC- and RAD51/FANCD2-mediated melanoma cell resistance. Cancer Res; 76(10); 3067–77. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

guanine and inactivates MGMT (6). The resistance of melanoma
cells to methylating agents is therefore proportional to the cells'
MGMT activity level (7). MGMT expression is governed by the
methylation of CpG islands in its promoter (8) and the methylation status of MGMT has been shown to be predictive of
temozolomide-based melanoma therapy (9).
As melanomas express low levels of MGMT (10, 11), O6MeG
often persists in the DNA. Unrepaired O6MeG mispairs with
thymine during replication and O6MeG/T mismatches are
detected and bound by the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery.
Futile MMR repairs cause persistent stretches of single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA; ref. 12). If these stretches of ssDNA are not bypassed
by homologous recombination (HR) during DNA synthesis, DNA
double-strand breaks (DSB) arise (13, 14) that trigger apoptosis in
melanoma cell lines (7). The protective role of RAD51-mediated
HR in methylating agent–treated cells has been demonstrated in
glioma and melanoma lines (15, 16). DNA repair by MGMT and
HR is therefore central in protecting metastatic melanoma against
methylating agent–based therapies.
Class I histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been described to
be elevated in gastric, breast, colorectal, lung, and liver cancers
(17, 18) and may contribute to those cancers' response to
therapy. In melanoma, pan-HDAC inhibitors in combination
with temozolomide have shown promise (19, 20). For these
reasons, we addressed the role of class I HDACs in melanoma
and determined the molecular mechanism whereby these
HDACs inﬂuence the response of melanomas to temozolomide. The class I HDACs are HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and

Patients suffering from melanoma in its metastatic stage have a
dismal prognosis. Although newer therapies targeting mutant
BRAF or immunotherapies with ipilimumab or anti-PD-1-antibody have shown promise (1–3), the cancer invariably becomes
resistant, which necessitates the switch back to genotoxic-based
therapies. These therapies include methylating agents such as
dacarbazine and temozolomide. Methylating agents either
require metabolic activation by cytochrome P450, in the case of
dacarbazine (4), or spontaneously decompose, in the case
of temozolomide (5), to the DNA reactive species 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). The clinically relevant cytotoxic DNA lesion for these drugs is O6-methylguanine
(O6MeG). O6MeG is repaired by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a stoichiometric reaction, which restores

HDAC8 (17, 18). They deacetylate histones and nonhistone
proteins, thereby contributing to gene and protein regulation.
In cancer cells, the inhibition of HDACs has been shown to
inﬂuence the execution of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
pathways as well as affecting DNA repair (21).
Our data reveal that melanoma specimens obtained from
patients following surgery contain nuclear localized HDAC1/2
and that melanoma cell lines overexpress HDAC1/2/3 compared with primary melanocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLC), and ﬁbroblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of class
I HDACs sensitizes melanoma cells to temozolomide, fotemustine, and ionizing radiation (IR) and inhibits tumor growth in a
xenograft melanoma tumor model more effectively than temozolomide alone. HDAC1/2/3 inhibition sensitizes melanoma
cells to the temozolomide-induced DNA lesion O6MeG due to

suppression of HR-mediated DNA repair caused by downregulation of RAD51 and FANCD2 on gene and protein level.
Finally, we identiﬁed HDAC2 as essential for RAD51 regulation. These ﬁndings are a sound basis for further exploring the
targeting of class I HDACs during melanoma therapy with
genotoxic agents.

respectively. VH10tert was a gift from L.H.F. Mullenders
(Department of Toxicogenetics, Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands) in 2008. A375 and G361 were purchased
from the ATCC in 2008. PBLCs were isolated from buffy-coat
blood as described previously (22). Primary human epidermal
melanocytes light pigmented (Hema-LP) were purchased from
Gibco in 2012 and 2013. Upon receipt of the cell lines, they
were cryopreserved in liquid-N2 and fresh cell stocks were used
for every battery of tests. All lines were characterized in the
laboratory of origin, displayed the expected phenotype, but
were not reauthenticated in our laboratory. D05, Mel537, and
PBLCs were cultured in RPMI-1640, while SK-Mel187, A2058,
A375, and VH10tert were cultured in DMEM. RPMI1640 and
DMEM were supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (PAA). Hema-LP was cultured in Medium254 (Gibco)
supplemented with human melanocyte growth supplement-2
(Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5%
CO2 atmosphere.

Drugs, treatment, and irradiation
The handling and preparation of temozolomide (ScheringPlough), fotemustine (Muphoran, Servier Research International), O6-benzylguanine (O6BG, Sigma-Aldrich), and olaparib
(AZD2281, Selleck Chemicals) has been described previously
(15, 23). To inhibit MGMT, O6BG was added to cells (ﬁnal
concentration 10 mmol/L) one hour before alkylating agent
treatment. Irradiation was performed using a Cs-137 source.
Valproic acid sodium salt (VPA, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved to
100 mmol/L in dH2O and stored at 80  C after sterile ﬁltration.
Cells were pretreated with VPA (1 mmol/L) for 168 hours with
refreshment of VPA-containing medium every 48 hours and VPA
removal before further treatment or irradiation. MS-275 (Entinostat, Selleck Chemicals) was dissolved in DMSO to a stock
solution of 5 mmol/L and stored at 80 C, and before use it
was diluted in PBS to 1 mmol/L. Cells were pretreated with
MS-275 for 72 hours and then removing the compound by
medium change.

Tumor biopsies and IHC
Samples of malignant melanoma were obtained from
patients following surgery. Patient material was obtained with
informed consent and approval from the Institutional ethics
committee of the University Medical Center Mainz (Mainz,
Germany). Slices were obtained from parafﬁnized sections,
which were labeled as to the tumor area. Immunohistochemical analysis of HDAC1/2 levels was performed as described
previously (23). For antibodies, see Supplementary Table S1.
Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3. Microphotographs were
acquired by laser scanning microscopy (LSM710, Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging). Three different tumors were analyzed.
Preparation of protein extracts and Western blot analysis
Preparation of whole cell (24) and nuclear (25) protein extracts
were described previously. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (26). For antibodies, see
Supplementary Table S1.
Determination of apoptosis and cell cycle
Analysis of cell cycle, sub-diploid DNA content (sub-G1;
ref. 27) and Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) doublestained cells have been described previously (7). Flow cytometry was performed using FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and
the data were analyzed with WinMDI (sub-G1, Annexin V/PI) or
ModFit (cell cycle).

Determination of MGMT activity
MGMT activity assay was performed as described previously
(28).
Colony survival assay
G361, SK-Mel187, Mel537, A2058, and A375 melanoma cells
were pretreated with VPA for 168 hours. Following VPA removal,
logarithmic growing cells were seeded and allowed to attach for
6 hours before O6BG addition and 1 hour later cells were exposed
to temozolomide. Colonies were ﬁxed in acetic acid:methanol:
H2O (1:1:8), and stained with 1.25% Giemsa and 0.125% crystal
violet.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR
Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR were
performed as described previously (29). RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH and ACTB.
Homologous recombination repair assay
HR repair capacity was assessed with a stably genomic
integrated reporter plasmid as described previously (30). The
pDR-GFP reporter plasmid (Addgene plasmid 26475; ref. 30)
and the SceI-expressing plasmid pCBASceI (Addgene plasmid
26477) were used (31). The cells were analyzed 48 hours
(A375) or 72 hours (D05) after pCBASceI transfection, using
Effectene (Qiagen), by ﬂow cytometry.

HDACs and Homologous Recombination in Melanoma

Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescent labeling of gH2AX-foci was performed as
described previously (15). For antibodies, see Supplementary
Table S1.
siRNA, plasmids, and stable knockdown
siRNA targeting the mRNA of HDAC1 (Dharmacon), HDAC2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc.), and HDAC 3 (Ambion, Life
Technologies) was transfected into A375 and D05 cells using
Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen). A pSuper (OligoEngine)
construct was generated to express shRNA targeting RAD51 mRNA
using the previously described sequence (50 -GAAGAAAUUGGAAGAAGCU-30 ; ref. 32). Plasmid DNA was transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). Transfected cells were selected with 0.75 mg/mL
G418 (Invitrogen).
Animal experiments
Immunodeﬁcient mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J) were housed
in a sterile environment and allowed free access to food and water.
The animal experiments were approved by the government of
Rhineland-Palatinate and the Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University Medical Center Mainz (Mainz, Germany) and
performed according to the German federal law and the guidelines for the protection of animals. A375 human melanoma
xenografts were initiated by injecting 8  106 cells in the right
and left ﬂank and the treatments began when tumor volumes
[(LWHp)/6] reached a suitable size (50–100 mm3). Four
animals each were assigned to the different groups and tumor
volume was standardized across the groups. The groups
that received VPA pretreatment were treated as follows. Six days
before O6BG and temozolomide injection, mice were injected
intraperitoneally once daily with 500 mg/kg VPA. The mice
received one dose intraperitoneal of temozolomide (150 mg/kg).
One hour prior to temozolomide injection, all mice received

O6BG 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Animal weights and tumor
volumes were monitored following temozolomide injection. The
in vivo experiments were performed twice, once with female mice
(4 per group) and once with male mice (4 per group). The
presented data show the results from both groups.

Results
Melanoma cells overexpress HDAC1/2/3
Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in cancer. We addressed
whether this is the case for melanomas. Making use of the publicly
accessible microarray dataset E-GEOD-3189 from ArrayExpress
and published in ref. 33, the expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, and
HDAC3 in 45 primary melanoma samples were compared with 18
benign skin nevi and 7 normal skin samples. The primary melanoma samples showed a signiﬁcant overexpression of HDAC1
and HDAC2 compared with the benign nevi and the normal skin
tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, melanoma tumor
samples analyzed by IHC showed strong HDAC1/2 nuclear
staining compared with the cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1A), whereas melanoma cell lines express signiﬁcantly more HDAC1/2/3
proteins compared with primary human epidermal melanocytes
(Hema-LP), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLC), and diploid
human ﬁbroblasts (VH10tert; Fig. 1B and C). PBLCs did express
class I HDACs (Supplementary Fig. S1B), but were excluded from
further analysis because of their very low expression, but the
signiﬁcance remained when they were included in the analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). As class I HDACs can deacetylate
histones 3 (H3) and 4 (H4; ref. 34), we determined whether
inhibition of class I HDACs with valproic acid (VPA; ref. 35)
inﬂuences the acetylation level of H3 and H4 in melanoma lines
(Fig. 1D). Upon VPA treatment, all the melanoma cell lines
showed increased H3 and H4 acetylation levels, decreased
HDAC2 levels in A375, G361, SK-Mel187, Mel537, and D05,
which is consistent with what has been reported previously

(36, 37), while HDAC1/3 levels were not inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly.
For the noncancer cells Hema-LP, PBLCs and VH10tert VPA
pretreatment also caused an increase in acetylated-H3 levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). Collectively, the data show that malignant melanomas express HDACs and that the overexpressed class
I HDACs in melanoma cell lines can be inhibited by VPA.
HDAC1/2/3 protect malignant melanoma cells against
genotoxin-induced cell death
Having shown that HDAC1/2/3 are overexpressed in melanoma cells, the inﬂuence of these HDACs on genotoxininduced cell death was determined. Two melanoma cell lines,
D05 and A375, as well as primary human melanocytes, HemaLP, were pretreated with the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) VPA, a
fatty acid inhibiting HDAC1/2/3/8 and clinically used for the
treatment of epilepsy (35, 38), and exposed to temozolomide,
fotemustine, or IR (Fig. 2A). It is important to note that at the
administered concentration of temozolomide and fotemustine,
O6MeG and O6-chloroethylguanine (O6ClEtG) are the clinically relevant apoptosis-inducing DNA lesions in melanoma cells
(7). For this reason, we performed all experiments, unless
stated otherwise, by inhibiting MGMT with O6BG before temozolomide or fotemustine treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, VPA
signiﬁcantly sensitized the melanoma cells to temozolomide-,
fotemustine-, and IR-induced apoptosis while not inﬂuencing
the response of primary human melanocytes.
Furthermore, VPA sensitized melanoma cells to temozolomide
in a concentration (Fig. 2B) and pretreatment time-dependent

(Fig. 2C) manner. Because temozolomide exerts its cytotoxicity
through O6MeG and this lesion is repaired by MGMT (7, 9), the
sensitization of melanoma cells by HDAC inhibition was determined in the absence and presence of MGMT activity using O6BG
(Fig. 2D). MGMT protects not only against temozolomideinduced apoptosis, but also against the sensitization caused by
VPA (Fig. 2D), indicating that VPA sensitizes melanoma cells to
O6MeG DNA lesions. As HDAC8 was not overexpressed in melanomas (Fig. 1C), we determined whether it contributes to the
sensitization of melanoma cells to temozolomide. This was
accomplished by using the benzamide HDACi MS-275, which
speciﬁcally inhibits HDAC1/2/3, but not HDAC8 (38). MS-275
sensitized D05 and A375 melanoma cells to temozolomide in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2E), showing that the
catalytic activity of HDAC1/2/3, but not HDAC8, contributes to
the resistance of melanoma cells to temozolomide.
As MGMT protects cells against alkylating agents, we determined whether HDAC inhibition affects this enzyme. HDAC
inhibition only marginally inﬂuenced MGMT activity in one cell
line tested (A375), while not affecting the other (D05; Fig. 2F).
Seeing that HDAC inhibition did not inﬂuence MGMT activity in
D05 cells (Fig. 2F) and HDAC inhibition sensitizes cells to IRinduced DNA damage (Fig. 2A), which are not subject to repair by
MGMT, we conclude that the sensitization of melanoma cells to
temozolomide is not due to an effect on MGMT. Furthermore,
cellular replication rate signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the response of
cells to methylating agents (22). To exclude this as a reason for
HDACi-mediated sensitization to temozolomide, analysis of

cell-cycle distribution (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and cellular
growth rates (Supplementary Fig. S2B) were performed following
VPA pretreatment. VPA neither changed the cell-cycle distribution
nor the growth rate of melanoma cells. Collectively, the data
indicate that overexpression of HDAC1/2/3 protects melanoma
cell lines against DNA damage triggered cell death.
Class I HDAC inhibitors promote temozolomide-induced cell
growth inhibition in melanoma cell lines and a melanoma
xenograft model
To clarify that the sensitization to temozolomide of melanoma
cells by HDAC inhibition is a general effect, a panel of melanoma
cell lines was subjected to the colony survival assay in the presence
and absence of class I HDAC inhibition (Fig. 3A). All tested
melanoma cell lines were sensitized to temozolomide following
VPA. When combining the survival data of Fig. 3A, the sensitization caused by the HDACi in temozolomide-treated cells was still
apparent (Fig. 3B), showing that this sensitization effect would
very likely also be observed in heterogeneous melanoma tumors.
To establish whether the ﬁndings obtained in cell lines in vitro can
be translated to melanoma cell growth in vivo, we determined the
effect of A375 cells grown subcutaneously in immunodeﬁcient
mice. HDAC inhibition with VPA pretreatment was able to
increase the acetylated-H3 levels in melanoma xenografts
(Fig. 3C), showing that VPA was able to inhibit class I HDACs
in this model system. A single treatment with temozolomide
(150 mg/kg) delayed tumor growth, HDAC inhibition by VPA
pretreatment on its own had no effect on tumor growth, whereas
temozolomide (150 mg/kg) in combination with VPA showed
signiﬁcant more tumor growth inhibition compared with temozolomide alone (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3A). For the
inﬂuence of this treatment schedule on the weight of the mice, see

Supplementary Fig. S3B. The melanoma xenograft model results
reﬂect the results obtained in vitro with cell lines and show that
inhibition of class I HDACs enhances melanoma tumor growth
inhibition by temozolomide.
Inhibition of HDAC1/2/3 downregulates RAD51 and FANCD2
To identify how class I HDAC inhibition causes sensitization to
temozolomide, a real-time PCR array was performed. Class I
HDACs were inhibited in D05 melanoma cells using VPA and
changes in mRNA were monitored by real-time PCR (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Table S2). Genes involved in apoptosis, BCL2,
NOXA, PUMA, and BAX, were either up- or downregulated while
genes involved in DNA repair, RAD51, RAD51D, FANCD2, and
KU80, were downregulated (Fig. 4A). To validate these results,
speciﬁc real-time PCR experiments were performed with two
melanoma cell lines, D05 and A375, following VPA pretreatment
(Fig. 4B). Again, up- and downregulation of these genes was
observed. Next, we tested whether changes in gene expression
reﬂect changes in protein level. To this end, the inﬂuence of VPA
on RAD51, FANCD2, RAD51D, ATR, KU80, BAX, NOXA, and
BCL2 protein levels was analyzed (Fig. 4C). Following HDAC
inhibition, only RAD51 and FANCD2 protein levels decreased,
suggesting that decreased DNA repair capacity, and not increased
apoptosis ﬁdelity, is the cause for melanoma cell sensitization
toward temozolomide upon HDACi.
Using RAD51 as a marker for downregulation of DNA
repair following HDAC inhibition, we addressed the question
of time and concentration dependence. The time of class I
HDAC inhibition and the concentration of class I HDACi
used for pretreatment showed an inverse relationship with
the RAD51 protein level (Fig. 5A). This inverse relationship
affects the sensitization to temozolomide, as temozolomide

alone induced approximately 6% apoptosis in D05 cells while
increasing VPA pretreatment time and concentration signiﬁcantly
increased temozolomide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Therefore,
the decrease in RAD51 protein (Fig. 5A) mirrored the increase in
melanoma cell sensitivity to temozolomide (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
following class I HDACi removal, RAD51 protein levels stayed
suppressed for 48 hours. Temozolomide caused a decrease in
RAD51 protein level 72 hours after temozolomide addition,
whereas pretreatment with VPA followed by temozolomide addition suppressed RAD51 protein levels for the duration of the
experiment (up to 72 hours; Fig. 5C).
Having demonstrated that the inhibition of HDAC1/2/3/8
causes downregulation of RAD51 and FANCD2 in the melanoma cell lines D05 and A375, we expanded our examination
to additional melanoma cell lines: G361, SK-Mel187, Mel537,
and A2058. Following HDAC1/2/3/8 inhibition, all these cell
lines showed a decrease in RAD51 and FANCD2 protein
(Fig. 5D). As VPA inhibits HDAC1/2/3/8, the contribution of
the individual HDACs, HDAC1/2/3/8, to the expression of
RAD51 and FANCD2 was addressed. First, HDAC8 was assessed
by using the HDACi MS-275, which only inhibits HDAC1/2/3,
in D05 and A375 melanoma cells. Upon MS-275, the downregulation of RAD51 and FANCD2 was still observed (Fig. 6A),
showing that downregulation of these DNA repair proteins are
not caused by the inhibition of HDAC8. To address the contribution of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 to the expression of
RAD51, the individual HDACs were knocked down using
siRNA (Fig. 6B). Only the downregulation of HDAC2 corresponded to a simultaneous downregulation of RAD51, showing that of these three HDACs, only HDAC2 plays a role in the
expression of RAD51.
Inhibition of class I HDACs decreases homologous
recombination DNA repair, thereby sensitizing melanoma cells
to temozolomide
As the inhibition of HDAC1/2/3 downregulates RAD51 and
FANCD2, and both protect cancer cells against temozolomide
(15, 39) because of their role in HR (13, 40), the effect of HDACi
on HR was assayed. Inhibition of class I HDACs signiﬁcantly
decreased HR activity in both D05 and A375 melanoma cell
lines upon DSB induction (Fig. 7A and B). Dysregulation of HR
has been implicated in synthetic lethality caused by PARP-1
inhibition in cells and cancers defective for this repair pathway
(41). Therefore, if downregulation of RAD51 mediated by
HDACi inﬂuences HR repair then class I HDAC inhibition
should sensitize melanoma cells to the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib. This was in fact the case, as VPA signiﬁcantly sensitized
D05 cells to olaparib (Fig. 7C). A decrease in DSB repair caused
by class I HDAC inhibition should increase the amount of
unrepaired DSBs following temozolomide treatment. To this
end, the amount of gH2AX foci, a marker for DSBs, was determined in temozolomide-treated melanoma cells following
VPA. Pretreatment with VPA signiﬁcantly increased the amount
of unrepaired DSBs following temozolomide treatment (Fig. 7D
and E), showing that class I HDAC inhibition reduces tolerance
of melanoma cells to DSBs that arise during the processing of
O6MeG DNA lesions induced by temozolomide. Next, the
question of whether RAD51, and consequently HR, protect
melanoma cells against temozolomide was addressed. Following shRNA knockdown of RAD51, A375 cells were signiﬁcantly
sensitized to temozolomide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7F). The

3074 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

data show that inhibition of class I HDACs suppresses DSB
repair by HR in melanoma cells and that this results in their
sensitization to temozolomide.

Discussion
Despite our growing understanding of how DNA lesions
induced by chemotherapeutics such as dacarbazine or temozolomide trigger death (42), our grasp of the cellular context in
melanomas that cause intrinsic resistance to these agents is still
incomplete and may explain why melanoma patients face such
a bleak prognosis. Examples of why metastatic melanomas are
resistant to therapy are: they bypass cell-cycle checkpoints (43),
they express low levels of critical apoptosis proteins (27, 44),
they retain p53 wild-type status (45) allowing them to upregulate DNA repair genes (DDB2, XPC; ref. 29), and they express
an oncogenic form of BRAF giving them a growth advantage
(46). Here, we addressed the contribution of class I HDACs in
malignant melanoma protection against methylating chemotherapeutics, used, despite serine/threonine kinase inhibitors and immune-stimulating biologics (1, 3), as genotoxic
`gold standard' in the therapy of this cancer.
First, we show that melanoma tumors obtained from pretreatment patients express HDAC1/2, and that melanoma cell
lines overexpress HDAC1/2/3. These ﬁndings point to possible
roles of these HDACs in melanoma tumor formation and in the
resistance of this cancer to therapy. Before we addressed whether HDAC1/2/3 contribute to the resistance of melanomas to
methylating agents, we ﬁrst had to show that these HDACs can
be inhibited. To this end, an inhibitor of class I HDACs (35),
namely VPA, was used and conﬁrmed that this inhibitor is
active in melanoma cells.
Having established the experimental system, we demonstrate
that inhibition of class I HDACs sensitized melanoma cells to
temozolomide-, fotemustine-, and IR-induced apoptosis, while
not sensitizing primary melanocytes. Therefore, we conclude that
class I HDAC activity protects melanoma cells against genotoxic
interventions. Temozolomide, fotemustine, and IR used in the
therapy of metastatic melanoma induce different spectrums of
DNA lesions, repaired by different DNA repair pathways. Repair
of temozolomide-induced DNA lesions is mediated by MGMT,
base excision repair (BER) and HR, repair of fotemustine-induced
DNA lesions is mediated by MGMT, nucleotide excision repair
(NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair in which HR plays a
role and IR-induced DNA lesions are repaired by BER, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and HR (6, 42). For temozolomide, our data show that inhibition of HDAC1/2/3 causes sensitization to the DNA lesion O6MeG, and that this sensitization is
likely not due to modulation of MGMT. Furthermore, the protective role of class I HDAC activity in melanomas was conﬁrmed
in a panel of cell lines in vitro and a melanoma xenograft model in
vivo. Collectively the data revealed that class I HDAC activity
protects melanoma cells against methylating agents and that this
class of HDACs is a promising target for intervention during
therapy with temozolomide.
HDACs are centrally involved in protein regulation and gene
expression. Therefore, HDACs can theoretically play a role in the
expression of any gene, which demands screening methodologies
for identifying the factor causing the observed phenotype. To this
end, we used a real-time PCR array. The array data showed that
VPA affects factors involved in apoptosis and DNA repair on gene

expression level. The conclusions drawn from this are that VPA
sensitizes melanoma cells to temozolomide either due to better
apoptosis ﬁdelity or less effective DNA repair. To test these
hypotheses, the changes in these two groups of genes had to be
validated by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. RAD51 and
FANCD2 passed validation. By employing different HDAC inhibitors and siRNA targeting the speciﬁc HDACs, we were able to
identify HDAC2 as the class I HDAC responsible for the regulation
of RAD51. Further support for the role of DNA repair in the
observed sensitization to temozolomide is found in the results
obtained with fotemustine- and IR-treated melanoma cells upon
class I HDAC inhibition. Although temozolomide, fotemustine,
and IR induce different spectrums of DNA lesions, only HR is
involved in the repair of all these genotoxins (47). As RAD51 and
FANCD2 play central roles in HR (48), the downregulation of
these HR proteins may therefore be responsible for the observed
sensitization.

Having identiﬁed decreased DNA repair as the possible
mechanism for sensitization to temozolomide upon HDAC1/
2/3 inhibition, we addressed the questions of whether class I
HDAC inhibition affects HR activity, whether class I HDAC
inhibition results in more unrepaired DSBs following temozolomide treatment, and whether RAD51 protects melanoma cells
against temozolomide-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of class I
HDACs decreased HR-mediated DSB repair activity by almost
50%. This decreased HR repair activity resulted in an increase in
unrepaired DSBs showing that class I HDAC inhibition prevents
melanoma cells from tolerating DSBs arising due to the processing of the temozolomide-induced O6MeG adducts. Furthermore, RAD51 protects melanoma cells treated with temozolomide as knockdown of RAD51 signiﬁcantly sensitized the cells
to temozolomide. We should state that this protective role of
RAD51 was observed once MGMT was inhibited and that the
DSBs arising from O6MeG is dependent on MMR. Attenuated

HR could sensitize melanoma cells to PARP-1 inhibition as
synthetic lethality caused by PARP-1 inhibition is not inﬂuenced by MGMT or MMR. We show that HDAC inhibition by
VPA exacerbates the killing effect of PARP-1 inhibition by
olaparib in the absence of temozolomide, and that temozolomide could possibly increase this cytotoxicity.
The ﬁndings reported here suggest a model where HDAC1/2/3
are key nodes in the resistance of malignant melanoma cells to
methylating agent-based therapies by ameliorating the HRdependent repair of DSBs arising during the processing of O6MeG
DNA lesions. It forms a ﬁrm basis for targeting these HDACs
during genotoxic agent–based therapies in malignant melanoma
and possibly also in other tumor types.
