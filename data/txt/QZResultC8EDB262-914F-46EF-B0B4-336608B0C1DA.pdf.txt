The majority of men with prostate cancer are aged 65 years. Men, as they age,
are more likely to suffer from impaired physical function. The standard treatment
for recurrent prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Well-established toxicities from ADT include lean weight loss or sarcopenia, muscle weakness, fatigue, and reduced activity levels. Frailty is a term from geriatrics that

exhaustion, and low physical activity. This clinical syndrome overlaps closely
with the known toxicities of ADT. In addition, alterations in the inflammatory
system, neuroendocrine system, and energy production are associated with this
syndrome, as evidenced by biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, interleukin-6,
and tumor necrosis factor-a. For this article, the authors reviewed the evidence
for the effect of ADT on each of the 5 frailty components plus the identified biomarkers, and the evidence indicates that ADT may accelerate the development of
frailty in vulnerable older men with prostate cancer. Given the association of
frailty with important clinical outcomes such as hospitalization and death, this
potential consequence of ADT should be considered carefully when initiating
therapy in older patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Cancer 2007;110:2604–

rostate cancer is largely a disease of older men. Seventy-five percent of prostate cancer incidence and >90% of prostate cancer
mortality occurs in men aged 65 years.1 Men, as they age, are
more likely to have other comorbidities, and >50% of men with
prostate cancer aged 75 years have at least 1 serious comorbidity.2
Because of these competing comorbidities, the typically long natural
history of prostate cancer, and the higher prevalence of indolent
prostate cancer in the elderly, a significant number of older men
with prostate cancer will die with, but not as a result of their cancer.3 Consequently, older men with prostate cancer are likely to live
with the consequences of prostate cancer-related treatment for a
significant period of time.
In addition to higher rates of comorbidities, older men also are
more likely to have decreased functional reserve and are at

increased risk for adverse events, such as falls,
because of age.4 Because androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), the standard treatment for men with
recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer, causes
significant morbidity because of toxicities, including
muscle wasting, fatigue, and osteoporosis, it is imperative that oncologists have a better understanding of
the relative contribution of ADT to functional decline
and the development of frailty in older men with
prostate cancer. In this article, we review the concept
of frailty as a distinct geriatric diagnosis with wellcharacterized physiologic underpinnings, we describe
how frailty applies in the case of ADT, and we outline
its implications for treating older men with prostate
cancer. We also argue that the use of ADT to treat
prostate cancer in many older men can induce the
development of clinically significant frailty. In doing
so, we raise questions regarding the under appreciated consequences of treating vulnerable older men
with ADT, and we conclude that more research is
needed to guide treatment choices for older men
with prostate cancer in whom ADT is being considered, especially those with low-grade disease.

The Geriatric Syndrome of Frailty
Because prostate cancer largely affects older men, it
is important to be mindful of typical age-related
physiologic changes when treating older men for
prostate cancer. Aging itself is associated with
decreased physiologic reserve, decreased organ function, decreased functional reserve, and loss of complexity, which can lead to an increased risk of
adverse events.5,6 When such reserve decreases
enough to place an individual at heightened risk for
the development of illness and death, the individual
is considered frail. Frailty is a well-characterized geriatric syndrome that develops over time as a result of
an accumulation of stressors and results in a reduced
ability to maintain or regain homeostasis after a
destabilizing event.7,8 Although frailty frequently
exists concurrently with disease and disability, it has
been determined that frailty is independent from
these characteristics. Frailty is a complex syndrome
that is believed to result from multiple contributing
factors. Proposed criteria for physical frailty include
impairments in mobility, balance, muscle strength,
motor processing, cognition, nutrition, endurance,
and physical activity. Frailty also has been associated
with the geriatric syndrome of polypharmacy.9 In
addition, it has been demonstrated that frailty
criteria are associated with alterations in physiologic
variables, including inflammatory cytokines and
bioactive hormones.

2605

Older patients are a physiologically heterogeneous group, and the spectrum of impairment can
range from those who are independent, to those who
are at moderate risk for health deterioration (vulnerable), to those who are at a high risk of functional
decline or mortality (frail). Fried et al. have outlined
separate but interrelated definitions of these concepts.4 In their model, when age and disease-related
conditions aggregately cause systematic decline, the
frailty syndrome becomes apparent and can be
measured with well-defined physiologic and clinical
characteristics.

Pathophysiology of frailty
The underlying cause of frailty remains unproven.
Because it is believed that multiple systems likely
contribute to frailty, it has been challenging to elucidate the biology of this disorder. Immune system
alterations, chronic inflammation, poor energy production, and neuroendocrine dysregulation all are
believed to play important roles in the development
of frailty.7 Increasing research is identifying biomarkers of frailty that reflect this underlying pathophysiology (Table 1).10 Because it has been demonstrated
that chronic inflammation is one important mechanism underlying the physical decline that leads to
functional impairments in older adults, biomarkers of
inflammation have been investigated as markers of
frailty.11–13 In a large number of adults aged 65
years, higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 receptor antagonist were
found to be correlated significantly with abnormal
physical performance measures, including walking
speed, a chair-stand test, a standing balance test, and
hand grip strength.14 In a prospective trial of highly
functioning septuagenarians, baseline IL-6 and CRP
levels did not predict a change in performance measures over 7 years but did predict overall mortality.15
Results from a study of >3000 septuagenarians indicated that higher levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) were correlated with reduced muscle mass and strength.16 Another study of octogenarians indicated that high IL-6 levels and low
hemoglobin levels were observed in frail individuals
compared with individuals who were not frail.17 In
addition, high IL-6, high CRP, low albumin, and low
cholesterol all predicted mortality in older patients.18
Although both IL-6 and CRP have been linked to
prognosis in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer,19–21 the significance of these
markers in patients with hormone-sensitive disease
has not been reported. To our knowledge, measurement of these biomarkers to predict frailty specifically
in men with prostate cancer has not been reported.

Clinical manifestations of frailty
Most proposed definitions and descriptions of frailty
include components of mobility abnormalities, weakness, fatigue, and weight loss.4,22–24 In some reports,
cognitive deficits also have been proposed as part of
the clinical criteria for frailty.25 However, the most
commonly accepted clinical definition proposed by
Fried et al. operationalizes frailty as a clinical syndrome in which 3 of the following are present:
unintentional weight loss 10 pounds in the past
year, self-reported exhaustion, and weakness measured by grip strength, slow walking speed, and low
physical activity (Table 2).4 According to this definition, the overall prevalence of frailty in the general
geriatrics community of individuals aged >65 years
is approximately 7%, and it was reported that this
frailty phenotype was predictive of incident falls, wor-

sening mobility, and decreased ability to conduct
activities of daily living (ADL) resulting in functional
dependence, increased hospitalizations, and higher
mortality. To our knowledge, the prevalence of frailty
using this definition in older patients with cancer,
including older men with prostate cancer, has not
been reported.26

ADT in Prostate Cancer
In men, as they age, testosterone levels decrease (ie,
they develop hypogonadism) and an estimated 50%
to 80% of men aged >80 years meet the standard criteria for hypogonadism.27 Hypogonadism is associated with decreased bone mineral density,
decreased muscle mass, increased risk of falls, and
increased risk of impaired static balance.28 Because

Does ADT Induce Frailty?/Bylow et al.

ADT is simply an extreme form of hypogonadism, it
stands to reason that these adverse events also would
be associated with ADT.
ADT is the standard systemic treatment for
men with prostate cancer, particularly for those
with recurrent disease.29 Although studies of when
to initiate ADT in patients with biochemical recurrence have reported conflicting results, there are a
few clinical scenarios in which ADT appears to
improve outcomes in men with prostate cancer.
Studies have suggested a benefit in patients who
underwent definitive local therapy and had highrisk disease identified. Patients who were randomized to receive immediate ADT versus delayed
treatment had significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival.30,31 In a large study
of patients who had lymph node involvement and/
or tumors that were classified as T3 and who
received radiation, patients who were randomized
to receive immediate ADT showed no difference in
overall survival at 5 years32 but did demonstrate a
significant overall survival advantage at 10 years.33
Neoadjuvant and concomitant ADT also appeared
to improve outcomes in patients who received
radiation therapy for local disease. In a the landmark Phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
trial of patients with T2, T3, or T4 disease who were
randomized to receive external beam radiation with
or without neoadjuvant and concomitant ADT, the
ADT group had improved local control and diseasefree survival.34
ADT is being used increasingly in men with biochemical prostate cancer recurrence (ie, for rising
prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels after definitive
local therapy with no other evidence of disease) and
for men with localized disease, with or without radiation therapy, particularly for those aged 80 years.35
However, these patients often are asymptomatic (or
minimally symptomatic), and several studies have
reported no definitive overall survival benefit with
initiation of early versus late ADT, particularly for
older men.36,37 Because many older men are compromised hosts who already are experiencing impaired
physiologic function associated with aging and already are at increased risk for the development of
frailty, careful consideration of the toxicities associated with ADT is imperative before initiating it for
older men with prostate cancer.
It has been established that ADT can cause significant morbidity, including fatigue, anemia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and decrease in lean muscle
mass.38 Men with prostate cancer who were receiving
ADT for 12 months reportedly had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared with men

2607

who had prostate cancer and were not receiving ADT
and compared with healthy controls.39 Increased
prevalence of fractures in patients with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT has been reported, and
a correlation was identified between the duration of
treatment and the risk of fracture.40 Although it has
been hypothesized that osteoporosis is the key factor
contributing to the increased risk of fractures,41 to
our knowledge, the role of other factors, including
impaired muscle function and subsequent weakness
leading to mobility disorders and falls, has not been
characterized, and the relative contribution of ADT
to the clinical syndrome of frailty has not been
reported.

ADT and Frailty
Although several definitions have been proposed to
measure the multifactorial and complex syndrome of
frailty, we have adopted the clinical definition proposed by Fried et al. for the purposes of this article
and have focused this review on clinical outcomes. A
review of each of the 5 clinical criteria of frailty, as
defined by Fried et al.,4 in the context of treatment
with ADT follows. For each criterion, we describe the
specific measures used to classify an individual as
meeting the standard. Then, we describe the prevalence of that condition in the population. This is followed by the current evidence regarding the
contribution ADT makes to the development of that
condition, particularly for individuals in a prefrail
state of vulnerability, independent of the effects of
prostate cancer and aging itself on disability (Fig. 1).
This includes the evidence from biomarkers of frailty
associated with that condition (Table 1). It should be
remembered that, to meet the full criteria for frailty,
a patient must have 3 of the 5 criteria.
(Lean) weight loss
The first criterion for frailty is unintentional weight
loss >10 pounds in the last year. Unintentional
weight loss is a common problem among older
adults.42 Sarcopenia, defined as the unintentional
loss of muscle mass and function associated with
aging,43 is a major contributing factor to falls, loss of
independence, and frailty.44 It is estimated that the
prevalence of sarcopenia in community-dwelling
older adults is approximately 25%.45 In addition, agerelated reductions in skeletal muscle mass are greater
in men than in women, especially in the legs.46 It is
estimated that there is a loss of 5% of muscle mass
per decade of life from the fourth decade on, with
potentially more rapid loss after the age of 65
years.47–49

the increased prevalence of mobility disorders, functional dependence, and falls.

FIGURE 1. The possible contribution of androgen-deprivation therapy
(ADT) to the development of frailty.

Although men with prostate cancer who are
receiving ADT commonly gain rather than lose
weight, there is strong evidence that body composition is altered significantly by ADT; and, as a consequence of its initiation, men lose lean muscle mass
while gaining fat mass.50 The loss of lean body mass
(ie, sarcopenia) is related directly to muscle strength
and physical performance, and it is the most relevant
component of the weight-loss criterion in the development of frailty.
Evidence suggests that sarcopenia is hastened
with the initiation of ADT. In a study of young,
healthy men who were androgen-ablated with a
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, a significant decrease in lean mass as well as
strength was noted within weeks.51 In an analysis of
40 men with prostate cancer who were started on
LHRH agonist therapy, a statistically significant
decrease in lean body mass and paraspinal muscle
diameter on computed tomography scan was
reported as early as 3 months after therapy initiation.52,53 Other trials also have reported significant
decreases in lean body mass.54,55 Similar findings of
adverse effects on body composition have been
reported in prospective studies of men with prostate
cancer who were started on ADT.52,53 Affirming the
role of inflammatory biomarkers of frailty and sarcopenia, elevated levels of IL-6 have been associated
with low muscle mass in a study of elderly men ages
70 to 79 years.16 Loss of lean body mass caused by
ADT (ie, induced sarcopenia) most likely is 1 causal
pathway that increases the risk of frailty, including

Weakness
The second clinical criterion for frailty is muscle
weakness, as measured by low grip strength. Measurement of grip strength using a hand-held dynamometer is an overall indicator of muscle strength/
weakness. It has been established that reduced hand
grip strength predicts both disability and functional
decline in the general population.56,57 Individuals
with grip strength in the lowest quintile, adjusted for
sex and body mass index, meet this criterion for
frailty.
Muscle strength decreases with age. In a crosssectional study of 654 individuals from the Baltimore
Study on Aging, a nearly 50% loss of concentric isokinetic knee extension torque strength was observed
between ages of 30 years and 80 years,58 and a correlation between muscle mass and strength has been
established.59,60 The average reported age-related
decreases in strength are approximately 20% to 40%
when comparisons are made between younger adults
in their 20s compared with older adults in their 70s
or 80s, and even greater losses (>50%) were reported
when comparisons were made with older adults in
their 90s.61
In addition to the muscle wasting that occurs
with the initiation of ADT, muscle weakness also has
been reported in men on ADT. In a cross-sectional
study that compared 20 men who had nonmetastatic
prostate cancer and were receiving ADT with 18 agematched men who had nonmetastatic prostate cancer
and were not receiving ADT and with 20 age-matched,
healthy controls, it was observed that the patients
receiving ADT had reduced upper limb strength and
lower scores on a questionnaire-based physical performance test.62 In addition, biomarkers of frailty,
including elevated IL-6 and elevated CRP, have been
correlated with low grip strength in both a prospective
study of 1020 healthy adults aged 65 years and in a
study of 880 highly functional adults ages 70 to 79
years.14,15 Once again, this measure of frailty is
increased differentially in men who are receiving ADT.
Mobility
The third criterion for frailty is slow walking speed.
This is based on a timed walk of 15 feet, adjusting
for sex and height, with the lowest quintile classified
as meeting this criterion for frailty.
Walking speed, which is an objective measure of
physical performance, is part of the standard evaluation of mobility disorders in geriatric patients.63 Slow
walking speed has been associated with decreased

Does ADT Induce Frailty?/Bylow et al.

leg strength and power,64 lower self-rated health,65
and increased mortality.66 Abnormalities of mobility
are an independent predictor of falls.67,68 Although
the causes of mobility impairment are remarkably
wide-ranging, abnormalities in muscle mass and
strength play a major role, and it is estimated that
from 35% to 40% of the community-dwelling population aged 65 years fall every year.69–71
Despite the established adverse effect of ADT on
body composition, muscle strength, and self-reported
physical function, to our knowledge the correlation
between these changes and objective measures of
mobility and falls in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT has not been reported to date. However, elevated levels of IL-6 have been associated with slow
walking speed in a cross-sectional study of 880 highfunctioning adults ages 70 to 79 years who were participating in the MacArthur Study of Successful
Aging.15 In addition, mobility and falls have been
reported in patients with partial androgen deficiency,
which is a less extreme lowered testosterone state
compared with overt hypogonadism. In a study of
1040 elderly men that was designed to identify the
clinical and biologic patterns of hypogonadism, compared with men who had normal testosterone levels,
hypogonadal elderly men had a higher risk of falls
(odds ratio [OR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.31–3.70 [P < .01]); decreased lower extremity
muscle strength, as measured by repeated chair
stands (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.78–12 [P < .01])
and impaired balance (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.19–7.38
[P < .05]).28 In a longitudinal study of 2587 community-dwelling, ambulatory men aged 65 years
(mean age, 73 years), compared with men who had
the highest level of bioavailable testosterone, it was
observed that men who had testosterone levels in
the lowest quartile had slower walking speed (1.10
meters per second vs 1.18 meters per second;
P < .001), decreased lower extremity power (199.0 W
vs 217.7 W; P < .001), lower hand grip strength (26.8
kg vs 39.3 kg; P < .001), and higher risk of falls (OR,
1.42; 95% CI, 1.19–1.70 [P < .001]).72 Thus, there is
some indirect evidence to suggest that men who are
receiving ADT, which is the ultimate hypogonadal
state, will have impaired walking speed, which would
meet this criterion for frailty.

Exhaustion/fatigue
The fourth criterion for frailty is poor endurance and
low energy, as indicated by self-reported exhaustion.
Fatigue is a common, if under recognized, symptom
in older adults that impacts their quality of life.73
Fatigue also is a well-known side effect of ADT. A
quality-of-life analysis that was performed in a ran-

2609

domized trial of 144 men with biochemical recurrence compared those who were started on ADT with
those who were not; patients receiving ADT had significantly worse scores on self-reported fatigue
(P 5 .001).74 Similar findings were reported in studies
that compared prostate cancer patients receiving
ADT with patients who were not on treatment.75,76 In
a study of 91 patients with lymph node-positive disease, at 18-month assessments, the men who were
receiving ADT had more fatigue (P 5 .021) than the
men who were not receiving ADT.76 Thus, a higher
prevalence of fatigue and exhaustion has been noted
in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT, meeting
another of the frailty criterion.

Physical activity
Low physical activity is the fifth criterion for frailty.
This is measured by using a version of the Minnesota
Leisure Time Activity questionnaire, and the lowest
quintile of physical activity in kilocalories expended
per week meets this standard.77,78
In a study of 883 elderly individuals (426 men;
mean age, 73.6 years), it was observed that men with
sarcopenia had a 3.7-fold increased risk of having a
disability in 3 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, a 3.2-fold increased risk of having a balance disorder, a 1.9-fold increased risk of having a gait
abnormality, and were more likely to have used a
cane (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–4.9) or experienced a fall
(OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4–4.7) in the past year.45 Thus, it
is likely that men who experience sarcopenia from
ADT would be at risk for the decreased physical activity underlying these outcomes.
Supporting this claim, a high degree of functional and physical impairment was observed in a
pilot study of 50 men with recurrent prostate cancer,
including 80% with biochemical recurrence only,
who were receiving ADT.79 Specifically, 50% of
patients had an abnormal score on the Vulnerable
Elders Survey-13 (VES-13), a geriatric screening tool
that is used to identify patients at risk for functional
decline.80 On the VES-13, 36% and 20% of patients
reported difficulty with performing daily physical
and functional activities, respectively. This suggests
that a significant percentage of older patients with
prostate cancer who have been receiving ADT for a
long time have functional and physical impairments,
which make it likely that they will meet this final criterion of frailty.
Summary Assessment for Frailty
To be classified as frail according to the criteria of
Fried et al., older adults must meet 3 of the 5 criteria
described above. Approximately 5% of men in the

2610

CANCER

December 15, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 12

general geriatrics population aged >65 years meet
these criteria for frailty.81 From the existing data on
functional and physical impairments in older men
on ADT, we have produced evidence that receiving
ADT is associated with all of the elements of
the operational definition in contrast to matched
cohorts. In addition, the physiologic components of
frailty expressed by biomarkers also are elevated. It
appears plausible that older men, who comprise the
vast majority of the population with recurrent prostate cancer (many of whom already are at heightened
risk for developing frailty), can have full-fledged
frailty induced with the initiation of ADT.
In conclusion, >70% of the >200,000 men who
are diagnosed annually with prostate cancer are aged
>65 years.82 In addition, age is correlated positively
with the likelihood of being treated with ADT, and
48% of men aged 80 years receive ADT within 6
months of their diagnosis.40 Because so many older
men are exposed to the known toxicities of ADT, the
prevalence of frailty in this population most likely
is even higher than that in the general geriatrics
population.
Although it has been demonstrated that ADT can
lower quality of life, this has been considered an acceptable tradeoff for the presumed gains in life expectancy. Under-recognized aspects of lower levels of
testosterone, whether because of the development of
hypogonadism or from the administration of ADT,
are lean muscle loss, weakness, and fatigue. In addition, older men with prostate cancer who are on
long-term ADT have a high prevalence of abnormal
physical performance measures, mobility problems,
functional impairments, and falls. Because it has
been demonstrated that frailty predicts an increased
risk of disability, hospitalization, and death, the possibility of ADT lowering life expectancy by accelerating the development of frailty or even by causing
frailty is substantial and should be considered.
It is our recommendation that clinicians consider
and assess patients’ comorbidities, functional status,
mobility, and risk of falling—preferably with standardized tools80,83,84—before initiating ADT in any older
man with prostate cancer, but particularly in men
with asymptomatic biochemical recurrence. For
those patients who are frail (or prefrail) at the time
of diagnosis, ADT is more likely to cause clinically
significant morbidity and even mortality. Such
patients can be identified by using a short screening
instrument in this population.79 In these patients, it
is particularly prudent to consider active surveillance,
closely monitoring PSA kinetics (eg, PSA doubling
time) to aid in the treatment decision85 and to compare the risks of developing frailty with the risks of

disease spread. Neoadjuvant or concomitant physical
therapy is especially likely to benefit these patients,
who need to start ADT but are at significant risk of
falling, experiencing worsening mobility, and having
physical decline.86 Beyond this caution about using
ADT, we cannot recommend alternate treatment for
patients at this time. Although other initial hormone
therapy approaches have been studied, including
intermittent therapy, estrogens, and unopposed
antiandrogens, to our knowledge, these have not
been proven to have similar efficacy, they may not
obviate the toxicities of a castrate environment,
and/or they may introduce other toxicities in the elderly patient.29 Further research is needed to determine the prevalence of frailty in this patient
population and the relative contribution of age
versus ADT to the previously reported physical
decline experienced by these patients. Once the
relative contribution of ADT to physical decline in
older patients with prostate cancer has been better
quantified, treatment guidelines can be specified to
aid the clinician in how best to treat this complex
patient population.
