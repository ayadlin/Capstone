increased sensitivity to DNA damage observed with reduced
activity of any one of these kinases (3–5).
In response to double-strand breaks, ATM and ATR halt cell
cycle progression through activation of checkpoint signaling. The
canonical model of DNA damage checkpoint activation involves
ATM and ATR initiating two distinct signaling pathways dependent
on the type of DNA lesion present (6). After ionizing radiation (IR)–
induced double-strand breaks, ATM signals through checkpoint
kinase 2 (CHK2) to initiate a cell cycle checkpoint. Alternatively,
in response to double-strand breaks associated with replication
forks, ATR signaling through CHK1 is the predominant checkpoint
signaling pathway. However, a growing body of evidence indicates
overlap and cross talk between these signaling pathways (7–11).
DNA-PKcs, through its kinase activity and as a scaffolding
protein at the double-strand break site, contributes to the process
of nonhomologous end-joining, the major pathway for repair of
double-strand breaks in mammals (2). The essential nonhomologous end-joining components include DNA-PK (composed of the
heterodimeric Ku70/Ku80 subunit and DNA-PKcs), DNA ligase IV,
Artemis, and XRCC4 (12). On damage, Ku70/Ku80 is believed to
bind DNA and recruit DNA-PKcs to the double-strand break,
consequently stimulating its kinase activity (2). The endonuclease
Artemis is involved in DNA end processing, and nonhomologous
end-joining is completed with the joining of DNA ends by XRCC4
and DNA ligase IV (2). Studies correlating DNA-PK activity and
drug sensitivity suggest that DNA-PK may contribute to radioresistance and chemoresistance of tumor cells (12). In light of this,
DNA-PK inhibition is being studied as a means to modulate
resistance to standard cancer treatments (12).
Similar to the coordinated cross talk and overlapping activities of
ATM and ATR, there is some evidence of functional complementarity between ATM and DNA-PK. This complementarity is strongly
indicated by the observation that mice deficient in ATM and DNAPKcs are embryonic lethal (13). Additionally, there is some substrate
redundancy in the kinase activities of DNA-PK and ATM, such as
the phosphorylations of H2AX, replication protein A, and even
DNA-PKcs itself after DNA damage (14–17). However, in spite of
these observations, the extent of functional overlap between ATM
and DNA-PK and whether DNA-PK plays a role in cell cycle
checkpoint functions remain unclear. In the present study, we used
RNA interference (RNAi) to create and characterize several novel
human mammary epithelial cell lines with reduced ATM levels
that are isogenic with the parental lines. Surprisingly, using these
cells with reduced amounts of ATM, we identified a DNA-PK–
dependent, ATM-independent component of the IR-induced G2
cell cycle checkpoint. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence
showing a role for DNA-PK in activating DNA damage–induced
G2 checkpoint signaling. This observation may have significance in
the development of new chemotherapeutic approaches.

Abstract
Members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase
family, in particular the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
kinase and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein
kinase (DNA-PKcs), regulate cellular responses to DNA doublestrand breaks. Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR)
in DNA-PKcs– or ATM-deficient cells emphasizes their
important roles in maintaining genome stability. Furthermore, combined knockout of both kinases is synthetically
lethal, suggesting functional complementarity. In the current
study, using human mammary epithelial cells with ATM levels
stably knocked down by >90%, we observed an IR-induced G2
checkpoint that was only slightly attenuated. In marked
contrast, this G2 checkpoint was significantly attenuated with
either DNA-PK inhibitor treatment or RNA interference
knockdown of DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK,
indicating that DNA-PK contributes to the G2 checkpoint in
these cells. Furthermore, in agreement with the checkpoint
attenuation, DNA-PK inhibition in ATM-knockdown cells
resulted in reduced signaling of the checkpoint kinase CHK1
as evidenced by reduced CHK1 phosphorylation. Taken
together, these results show a DNA-PK–dependent component
to the IR-induced G2 checkpoint, in addition to the welldefined ATM-dependent component. This may have important
implications for chemotherapeutic strategies for breast
cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):89–97]

Introduction
Cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks rely heavily on
three members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase
(PIKK) family: the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), the
ATM and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and the catalytic subunit of
the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Whereas ATM and
ATR act as initiators of DNA damage checkpoint signaling (1),
DNA-PKcs has a critical role in double-strand break repair via
nonhomologous end-joining (2). The importance of each of these
proteins in maintaining genomic stability is underscored by the

(Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After 48 h, supernatant was collected and used to infect mammary
epithelial cells. Cells were infected in the presence of polybrene (6 Ag/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h, then medium was changed and cells were allowed
to grow for an additional 24 h. Pooled and clone populations were then
selected with 4 Ag/mL blasticidin.
For experiments in which either ATM or DNA-PKcs was knocked down
transiently, we used siRNAs targeting ATM (siRNA ID 1309) or DNA-PK
(siRNA ID 844; both from Ambion). As a negative control, a nontargeting
siRNA was used (siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA #1, Dharmacon). Cells
were seeded overnight and then transfected with siRNA for 48 h using the
TransIT-TKO reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mirus
Bio Corp.). Cells were then treated with 2-Gy IR, incubated for 2 h, and
harvested for analysis.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done with Student’s t test
using StatView software version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Inc.). Two-sided P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents. Nocodazole was purchased from SigmaAldrich and resuspended in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Stock
solutions were stored at 20jC. IFNa and calyculin A were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Calyculin A was resuspended in DMSO and stored at 20jC.
Blasticidin (Invitrogen) was resuspended in water and stored at 20jC.
Bleomycin, wortmannin, and NU7026 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell culture. The immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line
hTERT184 was derived from the normal human mammary epithelial 184 cell
line (18, 19) and was a kind gift from J. Carl Barrett (National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, MD). Cells were grown in defined MEGM media (Cambrex)
supplemented with 5 Ag/mL transferrin (Sigma), 10 5 mol/L isoproterenol
(Sigma), and 250 Ag/mL geneticin (Invitrogen) in a humidified 2% CO2
incubator. Two additional hTERT immortalized human mammary epithelial
cell lines, ME16C and HME-CC, were a kind gift from Dr. Charles M. Perou
(Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) and were grown as described (20).
Clonogenic assays. Exponentially growing cells were allowed to attach
overnight before being exposed to either g-radiation using a 137Cs source or
UV radiation using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). After 10 days, cells
were stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue, 5% acetic acid, and 30% methanol.
Colonies containing >100 cells were counted. The cell fraction surviving
treatment was normalized to survival of control cells.
Western blotting. Treated or control cells were harvested by scraping
into 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS,
10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue], sonicated for 15 s,
and heated at 99jC for 5 to 10 min. Aliquots representing equal amounts of
protein from each lysate were separated on a 6%, 7.5%, or 10% SDS-PAGE
gel and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Antibodies to phospho-CHK1
(Ser345), phospho-CHK2 (Thr68), double-stranded RNA–activated protein
kinase (PKR), phospho-PKR (Thr451), eukaryotic translation initiation factor
2a (eIF2a), and phospho-eIF2a (Ser51) were from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies to CHK1, CHK2, and DNA-PK were from Stressgen. The antibody
to phospho-ATM (Ser1981) was from Rockland Immunochemicals. The
antiserum to total ATM was generated in our laboratory (21); alternatively,
we also used anti-ATM purchased from Bethyl. The antibody to phosphoDNA-PKcs (Thr2609) was from Abcam. Equivalent loading and protein
transfer were confirmed by Ponceau stain and Western blot with either a
h-actin antibody (Sigma) or a h-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
and enhanced chemoluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of bands in Western
blots was done using ImageQuant TL v.2005 software (GE Healthcare).
Phosphorylated histone H3 immunostaining for mitotic fraction.
Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at 20jC. For
analysis, cells were immunostained with a mouse phospho-histone H3
(Ser10) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) followed by FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mitotic
percentage of treated samples was calculated as percentage of control.
Mean mitotic percentages were then determined for two or three
independent experiments.
RNAi and lentiviral infection. The BLOCK-IT Lentiviral RNAi
Expression System (Invitrogen) was used to create stable ATM-knockdown
hTERT184 cells. The following target sequences were used to express
double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding ATM shRNAs (the first three
sequences were obtained using the Invitrogen website and the last sequence
was obtained from Dharmacon and initially screened using siRNA): #1, 5¶GCATTCAGATTCCAAACAAGGCGAACCTTGTTTGGAATCTGAATGC-3¶;

Results
Human mammary epithelial cells expressing reduced levels
of ATM are sensitized to IR and bleomycin sulfate and have an
attenuated IR-induced G2 checkpoint. As a first step in
examining the DNA damage response in human mammary
epithelial cells, we ascertained the survival response of hTERT184
cells to IR with a clonogenic assay. This allowed us to identify a
suitable dose for subsequent analyses (Fig. 1A). We also examined
DNA damage signaling pathways activated after IR in hTERT184
cells. The introduction of DNA double-strand breaks leads to
autophosphorylation of ATM on Ser1981 and ATM activation (22).
ATM can then phosphorylate numerous targets, including p53 and
CHK2, and initiate cell cycle arrest (23). As expected, ATM was
phosphorylated in response to IR, as were the known ATM targets
p53 and CHK2 on Ser15 and Thr68, respectively (data not shown).
After initially using siRNA to transiently reduce ATM protein
levels, we sought to increase the knockdown efficiency by creating
hTERT184 cell lines stably expressing reduced levels of ATM.
Therefore, we generated lentiviral shRNA constructs encoding four
different ATM-targeting shRNAs. ATM mRNA (data not shown)
and protein levels were found to be reduced by TaqMan analysis
and Western blot analysis, respectively. When expressed using
lentivirus, three of these sequences were equally effective in
knocking down ATM protein (Fig. 1D). The ATM protein levels
were reduced in the cell lines expressing ATMshRNA#1 (hTERT184ATM1), ATMshRNA#2 (hTERT184-ATM2), ATMshRNA#4
(hTERT184-ATM4), and ATMshRNA#5 (hTERT184-ATM5) to 6%,
19%, 3%, and 5%, respectively, of the levels in the control cell line
(hTERT184-lacZ). In addition, we found no evidence for activation
of the IFN response after shRNA expression (24), as measured by
PKR and eIF2a phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that the lentiviral shRNA
sequences were specific for ATM and that the reduced expression
of ATM was not due to nonspecific antiviral responses.
Ataxia-telangiectasia cells are characterized by hypersensitivity
to agents such as IR and radiomimetic drugs (25). Likewise, ATMknockdown hTERT184 cells were sensitized to both IR (Fig. 1A)
and bleomycin sulfate (Fig. 1B). Clones isolated from the
hTERT184-ATM1 knockdown line were sensitized to IR to the
same degree as the pooled population (data not shown).
Importantly, ATM-deficient cells were not sensitized to killing
by UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent that generates DNA
lesions that are believed to signal predominately through ATR
(Fig. 1C).

DNA-PK and ATM in Mammary Epithelial G2 Checkpoint

In addition to radiosensitization, we and others have shown
that cells lacking ATM have a defective IR-induced G2 checkpoint
(26, 27). Histone H3 is phosphorylated early in mitosis and,
therefore, an antibody against phospho-histone H3 can be used
to assess the IR-induced G2 checkpoint delay of entry into mitosis
(28). As a positive control, we initially treated cells with nocodazole, an agent known to arrest cells in M phase. Cells treated
with 0.2 Ag/mL nocodazole for 21 h displayed a substantial
increase in phospho-histone H3 staining (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Treatment of parental and lacZ hTERT184 cells with a sublethal
dose of 2-Gy IR (Fig. 1A) induced a robust G2 checkpoint as
seen by a dramatic reduction in phospho-histone H3–positive
cells 2 h after IR exposure (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Surprisingly, treatment of ATM-knockdown hTERT184 cells
with 2-Gy IR resulted in only a minor attenuation of the G2
checkpoint (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the G2 checkpoint
seen following exposure to 2-Gy IR has an ATM-independent
component.

Figure 2. ATM-knockdown hTERT184 cells show a G2 checkpoint response
following IR and IR-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 and CHK2 in ATMknockdown cells. A, hTERT184-lacZ, hTERT184-ATM5, and hTERT184-ATM1
cells were treated with 2-Gy IR and collected and fixed 2 h after IR treatment.
Cells were stained with a phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody to assess the G2
checkpoint by flow cytometry. Columns, mean mitotic percentages of three
independent experiments; bars, SD. B, Western blot analysis of phosphorylation

treated with 2-Gy IR, cultured for an additional 2 h, and then analyzed for
phospho-CHK1 (Ser345), phospho-CHK2 (Thr68), total CHK1, and total CHK2
levels. h-Actin was used as a loading control. As a positive control for CHK1
phosphorylation, cells were also treated with 50 J/m2 UV radiation followed by
culturing for an additional 2 h. Con, control.

Figure 1. Clonogenic survival shows that stable knockdown of ATM in
hTERT184 cells sensitizes cells to IR and bleomycin sulfate but not to UV
radiation. hTERT184 cells and derivative lines were treated with the indicated
amounts of IR (A), bleomycin sulfate (B ), or UV radiation (C ) and colonies were
allowed to grow for 10 d. Points, mean of at least three independent experiments
in duplicate plates; bars, SE. D, human mammary epithelial hTERT184 cells
were infected with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs against ATM (#1, 2, 4, and 5)
and stable transfectants were selected with 4 Ag/mL blasticidin. Western blot
analysis of ATM levels was done with h-tubulin used as a loading control.

Figure 3. Transient transfection of
hTERT184-ATM5 stable knockdown cell
line with ATM siRNA only slightly
attenuates the G2 checkpoint response.
A, hTERT184-lacZ and hTERT184-ATM5
cells were transfected with a control siRNA
or a siRNA against ATM for 48 h, exposed
to 2-Gy IR, and then cultured for an
additional 2 h. Western blot analysis of
ATM, phospho-CHK2 (Thr68), and total
CHK2 levels was done. h-Actin was used
as a loading control. B, cells treated as in
A, but 2 h after IR, cells were collected and
fixed. Flow cytometry was done with a
phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody to
assess the G2 checkpoint. Columns, mean
mitotic percentages of two independent
experiments; bars, SD. Con, control;

G2 checkpoint attenuation displayed a similar phenotype, strongly
suggesting that these effects were due to specific loss of ATM and
not due to an off-target effect. However, because only a minor
attenuation of the G2 checkpoint was observed, it was possible that
residual amounts of ATM were still present in the knockdown lines,
providing sufficient DNA damage response signaling after 2-Gy IR
to elicit a G2 arrest. To address this, we transiently transfected both
the hTERT184-lacZ line and the hTERT184-ATM5 knockdown line
with siRNA against ATM in an attempt to further reduce ATM
levels in the hTERT184-ATM5 cell line. The sequence of this siRNA
was different from the original sequences used in the lentiviral
constructs. As shown in Fig. 3A, this siRNA was effective at
knocking down ATM in the control hTERT184-lacZ cells to f25%
of the starting protein levels. In contrast, even after a long
exposure, ATM in the hTERT184-ATM5 stable line is essentially
undetectable. We did find levels of phosphorylated CHK2 to be
slightly further reduced in the ‘‘double knockdown’’ from the
already reduced levels after IR treatment observed in the
hTERT184-ATM5 knockdown line alone (Fig. 3A). In contrast to
the hTERT184-ATM5 stable knockdown line with significantly
reduced levels of ATM and IR-induced CHK2 phosphorylation,
transient transfection of the control hTERT184-lacZ line did not
alter IR-induced CHK2 phosphorylation, presumably because
enough ATM was still present to phosphorylate CHK2 (Fig. 3A,
compare ATM levels in hTERT184-lacZ and hTERT184-ATM5 ATM
siRNA–treated lanes).
We carried out flow cytometry analysis to assess the IR-induced
G2 checkpoint after transiently knocking down ATM. Transient
knockdown of ATM in the control hTERT184-lacZ line did not
affect the IR-induced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 3B). Again, this was likely
due to residual levels of ATM persisting after transient knockdown
and failing to reach a ‘‘threshold’’ level for noticeable reduction in
ATM function. Transient transfection of ATM siRNA into the ATMknockdown line hTERT184-ATM5 slightly increased the attenuation of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 3B). Although we cannot
entirely eliminate the possibility that a very small amount of ATM
was still present in the double knockdown, these results together
with the results above strongly support activation of an ATMindependent aspect of the G2 checkpoint following exposure of
these mammary epithelial cells to IR.
Pretreatment of human mammary epithelial cells with
wortmannin attenuates the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. To gain

Knockdown of ATM in human mammary epithelial cells
diminishes IR-induced CHK2 phosphorylation but does not
affect CHK1 phosphorylation. To investigate the DNA damage–
induced signaling that resulted in a strong G2 checkpoint response
in spite of severely reduced levels of ATM (f5% of control levels),
we looked at the activation of the downstream effectors, CHK1 and
CHK2. Examination of checkpoint signaling in hTERT184-ATM5
cells showed greatly diminished phosphorylation of CHK2
following IR exposure, as expected from the reduction of ATM
levels (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we found CHK2 to be slightly
phosphorylated after UV and this phosphorylation did not
significantly change after knockdown of ATM (Fig. 2B). This
observation of CHK2 phosphorylation despite severely reduced
levels of ATM is in agreement with previous studies showing
that CHK2 can be phosphorylated independent of ATM at high
doses of IR, UV, or hydroxyurea (29).
Recent studies have shown that ATM can act upstream of ATR
to induce CHK1 phosphorylation after IR (7, 9, 10). ATM and
meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11) were shown to be required for
ATR recruitment to sites of DNA damage (7, 9, 10). Jazayeri et al.
(9) further showed that the exonuclease activity of MRE11 was
responsible for processing of DNA double-strand breaks to
replication protein A–coated single-strand DNA leading to ATR
recruitment and CHK1 phosphorylation.
From this model, one would predict that loss of ATM should
compromise IR-induced phosphorylation of CHK1. We assessed
the induction of CHK1 phosphorylation in hTERT184 parental,
hTERT184-lacZ control, and hTERT184-ATM5 knockdown cells
after IR treatment. IR-induced levels of CHK1 phosphorylation at
Ser345 in the ATM-knockdown cells were not substantially different
from control hTERT184-lacZ cells (Fig. 2B). This again suggested
that the G2 DNA damage checkpoint response observed despite
reduced levels of ATM (Fig. 2A) was mediated in an ATMindependent manner, likely involving CHK1 signaling. As expected,
treatment of cells with UV radiation caused robust and ATMindependent induction of CHK1 phosphorylation in all three cell
lines (Fig. 2B).
Transient transfection of human mammary epithelial cells
containing reduced levels of ATM with ATM siRNA only
slightly attenuates the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. The two

DNA-PK and ATM in Mammary Epithelial G2 Checkpoint

hTERT184-ATM5 cells with 10 Amol/L NU7026 had no effect on
attenuation of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. In contrast, whereas
pretreatment with 25 Amol/L NU7026 did not significantly affect
the G2 checkpoint of hTERT184-lacZ cells, pretreating hTERT184ATM5 cells with 25 Amol/L NU7026 dramatically attenuated the
IR-induced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 4B). These data, taken together
with the wortmannin data, suggest that in human mammary
epithelial cells, IR treatment activates both an ATM-dependent
pathway and a pathway that involves DNA-PK.
The involvement of DNA-PK in the G2 checkpoint damage
response to IR was further confirmed with RNAi knockdown of
DNA-PKcs. Transient transfection of the hTERT184-lacZ and
hTERT184-ATM5 cell lines with siRNA targeting DNA-PKcs
resulted in a substantial decrease in DNA-PKcs protein levels to
f20% and 45% of the untreated levels, respectively (Fig. 4C).
Knockdown of DNA-PKcs in the hTERT184-lacZ line did not
substantially affect the IR-induced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 4D). In
contrast, knockdown of DNA-PKcs in hTERT184-ATM5 cells was
accompanied by an f2.5-fold increase in the attenuation of the
IR-induced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 4D).
To address whether this involvement of DNA-PK in the G2
checkpoint was a characteristic of human mammary epithelial cells
in general and not unique to hTERT184 cells, we created stable
ATM-knockdown cell lines as before using two independent hTERT
immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines, ME16C and
HME-CC (20). As shown in Fig. 5A, ATM protein levels were significantly reduced in both cell lines following stable expression of
ATMshRNA#1, ATMshRNA#4, and ATMshRNA#5, and, to a lesser
extent, ATMshRNA#2, as was seen with hTERT184 cells (Fig. 1D).
To ensure that our results were not unique to the hTERT184-ATM5
line, we analyzed the G2 checkpoint response to DNA damage in

insight into the mechanism of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint in
human mammary epithelial cells with severely reduced ATM
function, we treated cells with the PIKK inhibitor wortmannin. At
the concentrations used, wortmannin has stronger inhibitory
activity against ATM and DNA-PK than against ATR (30).
Pretreatment of both hTERT184-lacZ and hTERT184-ATM5 cells
with 5 Amol/L wortmannin resulted in an attenuation of the IRinduced G2 checkpoint (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, pretreatment with
20 Amol/L wortmannin resulted in strong attenuation of the IRinduced G2 checkpoint in both the hTERT184-lacZ and hTERT184ATM5 cell lines. These results are consistent with wortmannin
inhibiting both ATM and DNA-PK and suggested that DNA-PK may
be involved in the IR-induced G2 checkpoint in human mammary
epithelial cells.
Inhibition or reduced expression of DNA-PK attenuates the
IR-induced G2 checkpoint in human mammary epithelial cells
containing reduced levels of ATM. To investigate more
specifically the potential involvement of DNA-PK in the G2
checkpoint or whether the wortmannin effect on the G2 checkpoint
was due simply to further inhibition of ATM, we used the
competitive and highly specific inhibitor of DNA-PK, NU7026.
NU7026 has a 60-fold greater potency against DNA-PK versus
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and is virtually inactive against ATM
and ATR (31). To verify that NU7026 was not inhibiting ATR, we
pretreated cells with 25 Amol/L NU7026 before UV exposure. We
found that NU7026 did not substantially inhibit UV-induced ATRdependent phosphorylation of CHK1 (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Furthermore, pretreatment with 25 Amol/L NU7026 did not affect
IR-induced ATM autophosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
strongly suggesting that ATM was not a target of NU7026. As
shown in Fig. 4B, pretreatment of both hTERT184-lacZ and

induced DNA damage were investigated with all three mammary
epithelial cell lines. In all three cell lines expressing the LacZ
control, ATM signaling was activated following IR, as reflected by
phosphorylation of the ATM substrate CHK2 (Fig. 6A–C). This
phosphorylation of CHK2 was not inhibited by the DNA-PK
inhibitor NU7026.
Knockdown of ATM levels in both hTERT184-ATM5 and HMECC-ATM1 cells (Fig. 6A and B) resulted in reduced phosphorylation
of CHK2 following IR treatment, supporting the conclusion that
ATM function was significantly reduced in these cells. In contrast,
ME16C-ATM1 cells still showed strong CHK2 phosphorylation
following IR (Fig. 6C), suggesting either that an alternate pathway
is phosphorylating CHK2 or that the levels of ATM in these cells are
sufficiently high to respond to IR-induced DNA damage.
DNA-PKcs itself was phosphorylated on Thr2609 following IR
treatment in hTERT184-lacZ cells, and this phosphorylation
increased in the presence of the inhibitor NU7026 (Fig. 6A).
Thr2609 phosphorylation was also observed, but to a lesser extent,
in hTERT184-ATM5 cells. With NU7026 treatment, phosphorylation
at this site was undetectable in hTERT184-ATM5 cells. This
indicates both ATM-dependent and DNA-PK–dependent contributions to Thr2609 phosphorylation, consistent with previously
published results showing that this particular residue can be
phosphorylated by ATM and DNA-PK (16, 17).
We then investigated the phosphorylation of the DNA damage
effector kinase CHK1 in response to IR-induced damage in all three
cell lines. In each cell line, when ATM was present at endogenous
levels in the LacZ controls, CHK1 phosphorylation was induced by
IR treatment (Fig. 6A–C). This was independent of the presence of
DNA-PK inhibition with NU7026. However, in each ATM-knockdown cell line, the induction of CHK1 phosphorylation by IR was
reduced or eliminated when DNA-PK was inhibited with NU7026
(Fig. 6A–C). Together, the results from Figs. 4–6 show that DNA-PK
inhibition in these ATM-knockdown cells results in attenuation of
the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and reduced signaling through
CHK1, suggesting that DNA-PK contributes to the activation of the
G2 DNA damage checkpoint response and that the mechanism of
this DNA-PK effect is via CHK1 signaling.
It is interesting to note that in each of the lacZ control cell lines,
treatment with NU7026 in combination with IR resulted in greater
levels of IR-induced phospho-CHK1 and CHK2 (and phospho-DNAPKcs in hTERT184-lacZ cells) than was seen when NU7026 was
absent. This observation is consistent with a previous report
showing enhanced activation of CHK1 and CHK2 after DNA-PK
inhibition (32) and may be reflective of interplay between PIKK
DNA damage response signaling pathways.
In summary, our data in multiple human mammary epithelial
cell lines with reduced ATM levels show a DNA-PK–dependent, IRinduced G2 checkpoint that involves CHK1 signaling. Whereas this
DNA-PK–dependent effect was only evident in lines with reduced
ATM, it may be present but obscured by ATM signaling in our
lacZ control cell lines. Thus, it seems that the enforcement of the
G2 checkpoint response to IR-induced DNA damage in human
mammary epithelial cells is an integrated response of ATMdependent signaling and ATM-independent, DNA-PK–dependent
signaling.

checkpoint response in HME-CC and ME16C human mammary epithelial cells.
A, human mammary epithelial ME16C and HME-CC cells were infected with
lentiviruses encoding shRNAs against ATM (#1, 2, 4 , and 5 ) and stable
transfectants were selected with 4 Ag/mL blasticidin. Western blot analysis of
ATM and DNA-PKcs levels was done with h-actin used as a loading control.
B and C, HME-CC and ME16C cells, respectively, were pretreated with the
indicated amounts of NU7026 1 h before 2-Gy IR treatment. Cells were collected

the ME16C and HME-CC cells expressing the ATMshRNA#1
(ME16C-ATM1 and HME-CC-ATM1, respectively). As seen in
Fig. 5B and C, respectively, HME-CC-ATM1 and ME16C-ATM1
cells show a strong G2 checkpoint arrest following treatment with
IR, which was only slightly attenuated relative to their lacZ control
cells. However, treatment with the potent DNA-PK inhibitor
NU7026 caused a release from the G2 checkpoint in a manner
similar to that seen in hTERT184-ATM5 cells (Fig. 5B and C).

DNA-PK and ATM in Mammary Epithelial G2 Checkpoint

the attenuation of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. Whereas we
cannot exclude the possibility that extremely low levels of ATM
contributed to the arrest seen in ATM-knockdown cells, we have
reduced levels of ATM protein below 10% of control levels and it
seems that an additional pathway exists that contributes to the
G2 checkpoint in the presence of reduced levels of ATM in these
human mammary epithelial cells.
Cellular responses to DNA damage include not only the
activation of cell cycle checkpoints to prevent cell cycle progression
but also activation of DNA repair pathways (3). Whereas DNA-PK
plays a critical role in double-strand break repair, it also seems to
play an active role in apoptosis induction after excessive DNA
damage (39). In addition, cells lacking DNA-PK have double-strand
break repair defects and are sensitized to radiation (5). However,
the role or roles DNA-PK may play in cell cycle checkpoint
functions remain unresolved.
Our studies using wortmannin suggested that DNA-PK was
involved in the IR-induced G2 checkpoint response in human
mammary epithelial cells. Indeed, use of the DNA-PK inhibitor
NU7026 compromised the IR-induced G2 checkpoint in the ATMknockdown cells after 2-Gy IR. A role for DNA-PK in the IR-induced
G2 checkpoint was confirmed using RNAi to reduce the levels of
DNA-PK, which resulted in a significant attenuation of the G2
checkpoint. Our data further show that this DNA-PK–dependent
signaling is associated with phosphorylation of CHK1. Although
CHK1 has clearly been shown to play an important role in the G2
checkpoint (40–42) and to interact with DNA-PKcs (43), this is the
first demonstration of a DNA-PK–dependent, CHK1-mediated G2
checkpoint response.
The apparent redundancy of DNA-PK with regard to what was
initially regarded as ATM-dependent IR-induced G2 checkpoint
responses is further supported by several reports from in vivo
mouse studies that provide evidence for ATM and DNA-PK having

DNA-PK–dependent and CHK1-mediated component in the IRinduced G2 checkpoint in these cells. To our knowledge, this is the
first report investigating the G2 DNA damage checkpoint in human
mammary epithelial cells with reduced ATM levels.
Our focus on mammary epithelial cell lines was motivated by
previous reports suggesting that mutations in the ATM gene
resulting in reduced ATM expression may contribute to breast
cancer (33–36). Thus, we sought to explore the mechanisms by
which human mammary cells respond to DNA damage and how
reduced ATM levels affect and alter these responses. With respect
to clonogenic survival, we found that human mammary epithelial
cells expressing reduced levels of ATM are sensitized to IR similar
to the sensitization of fibroblasts from individuals with ataxiatelangiectasia (37). In addition, these cells were also sensitized to
bleomycin sulfate but not to UV radiation. Much to our surprise,
reduced expression of ATM in these mammary epithelial cells
caused only a minor defect of the IR-induced G2 checkpoint after
exposure to 2-Gy radiation, less than the attenuation generally
observed following a comparable dose exposure of fibroblast
or lymphoblast cells from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia
(26, 38).
Modulation of RNAi pathways to knock down gene expression in
cells rarely results in complete loss of the protein of interest. To
address the potentially confounding issue of residual ATM
expression in our stable ATM-knockdown cell lines, we transiently
transfected the stable hTERT184-ATM5 and hTERT184-lacZ lines
with siRNA targeting ATM, in an effort to reduce any residual
amounts of ATM that could contribute to the G2 checkpoint
observed after 2-Gy IR. Transient transfection of ATM siRNA did
not attenuate the IR-induced G2 checkpoint in hTERT184-lacZ
cells, probably because ATM levels were only reduced to f25%
of control levels. Transient transfection of ATM siRNA into the
hTERT184-ATM5 stable knockdown line only slightly increased

levels. Total DNA-PKcs and phospho-DNA-PK levels are shown in hTERT184 lines. h-Actin was used as a loading control.

been implicated in having a role in the cellular response to DNA
damage (49). These results are intriguing and it is possible that
Artemis may play a role in DNA damage checkpoint responses in
human mammary epithelial cells as well.
In summary, we have shown that human mammary epithelial
cells have both ATM-dependent and DNA-PK–dependent pathways
to activate checkpoint responses to DNA damage. Loss of both
components may compromise genomic integrity, leading to
chromosomal damage. Consistent with this notion, it is interesting
that a recent report found an association between reduced DNAPK activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients and
sporadic cases of uterine, cervical, and breast cancer (50). Thus,
sporadic breast tumors may arise from multiple mutations
affecting independent pathways. It will be interesting to determine
if, in addition to loss of ATM (36), the corresponding breast tumors
also contain reduced DNA-PK activity. Alternatively, it will be
interesting to determine whether those breast tumors that show no
altered ATM levels or function might have alterations in DNA-PK
function. A better understanding of the involvement of ATM and
DNA-PK in breast cancer may provide better therapeutic strategies
for treating mammary tumors. Clearly, the precise role DNA-PK
plays in DNA damage responses in normal human mammary
epithelial cells requires further investigation.

complementary functions. Gurley and Kemp (13) found that
scid/scid (mutated gene encoding DNA-PKcs) ATM +/ and
scid/+, ATM / embryos developed normally whereas scid/scid,
ATM / embryos died early in embryogenesis, indicating redundant functions and/or synergistic interaction between mutations
in these two related kinases. Gladdy et al. (44) further showed that,
in fact, scid/scid, ATM / embryos failed to undergo normal
organogenesis and this was due to increased p53-independent
apoptosis. In addition, Lee et al. (45) reported that DNA-PK activity
is regulated in a cell cycle–dependent manner and further showed
that cells from scid/scid mice underwent permanent G2-M arrest
after irradiation. In line with these results, inhibition of DNA-PK
by DNA-PK–specific inhibitors also caused G2-M accumulation in
response to irradiation and topoisomerase II poisons (46, 47) and
DNA-PKcs–deficient cells were found to accumulate in G2-M after
IR (48). It is interesting that these studies showed that loss of
DNA-PK led to G2-M accumulation in response to DNA damage
(45–47). It was concluded that DNA-PKcs–deficient cells had an
intact IR-induced G2 checkpoint (48). It is important to note,
however, that in our work the DNA-PK–dependent component of
the IR-induced G2 checkpoint was only apparent in cells containing
reduced levels of ATM.
The mechanism of how loss of ATM and/or DNA-PK may
contribute to breast cancer remains unclear. Inhibition or loss of
DNA-PK activity would almost certainly cause the persistence of
DNA double-strand breaks that would activate ATM-dependent cell
cycle checkpoint mechanisms. Loss of ATM may lead to continual
cycling and further chromosome aberrations ultimately leading to
genomic instability. On the other hand, DNA-PK, in addition to its
known role in DNA repair, may be actively involved in DNA damage
checkpoint signaling. Loss of both ATM and DNA-PK would
compromise direct activation of signaling pathways leading to cell
cycle arrest. In addition, it was recently shown that both DNA-PK
and ATM can interact with and phosphorylate Artemis, which has
