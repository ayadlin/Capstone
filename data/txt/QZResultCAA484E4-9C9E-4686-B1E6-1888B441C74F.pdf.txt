BACKGROUND: Germ-cell cancer (GCC) patients aged 40 years have a two-fold higher GCC-specific mortality. It has been hypothesized that reduced treatment intensity combined with increased treatment related toxicity could be the explanation. The objective
was to analyze chemotherapy intensity, treatment related toxicity and survival in patients aged 40 years treated with standard
chemotherapy for GCC compared with a younger control group that received similar treatment during the same period. METHODS:
From 1984 to 2011, 135 patients aged 40 years with disseminated GCC treated with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). A control-group of 135 patients aged 18-35 years was randomly selected matched on year of BEP treatment. Cumulated doses of BEP as
well as bone marrow toxicity, renal- and lung functions were recorded before, during and after termination of treatment. All patients
were followed until death or October 1, 2011. RESULTS: The cumulated doses of BEP were comparable between the two groups, however, more patients aged 40 years were reduced in bleomycin doses based on a decrease in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity
corrected for haemoglobin (P 5 0.03). No differences between the two groups were found regarding bone marrow toxicity or mean
percentage changes in lung- or renal function. Patients aged 40 year had increased cancer specific mortality, HR 5 4.8 (P 5 0.005).
In particular patients with disease progression after first line chemotherapy had increased mortality (P 5 0.015). Moreover, the 5-year
overall survival for patients aged 40 years was 82.5% compared to the expected 5-year survival of the background population of
96.3% (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment related toxicity could not explain the increased cancer specific mortality in patients
aged 40 years compared to a younger control-group, and while there were no differences in the administrated doses of cisplatin/
etoposide, a decreased number of bleomycin doses were administered in the older patients. Apart from this, the inferior prognosis
could be related to tumour biology, increased co-morbidity, or more severe toxicity in relation to second line treatment. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Germ cell cancer (GCC) mainly affects young men, and approximately 70% of patients are aged <40 years at the time of
diagnosis.1 With cisplatin-based chemotherapy,2 most patients with GCC will be long-term survivors, and their 5-year
survival rate exceeds 90%.3 However, it has recently been demonstrated that patients aged 40 years have a 2-fold higher
GCC-specific mortality,4 and it is hypothesized that reduced treatment intensity combined with increased treatmentrelated toxicity in this age group may be the explanation.4-6 The objective was to analyze treatment-related toxicity, treatment intensity and survival in patients aged 40 years who received standard chemotherapy for disseminated GCC compared with a younger control group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Population

The study population comprised 270 patients with disseminated GCC who received treatment at Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark) during the period from 1984 to 2011 with either 3 or 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin
(BEP) (cisplatin 20 mg=m2 on days 1-5, etoposide 100 mg=m2 on days 1-5, and bleomycin 15,000 IU =m2 weekly) every
3 weeks. All patients were followed until death or October 1, 2011.

During the study period, 152 patients aged 40
years received treatment for disseminated GCC, and 138
of those patients received BEP. Three of the 138 patients
were excluded because they had incomplete data; thus, the
population aged 40 years consisted of 135 patients.
Over the same period, 446 patients ages 18 to 35 years
received BEP treatment for disseminated GCC; among
them, 135 patients who were matched on year of BEP
treatment were selected randomly as a control group. The
median time from entry to the end of study was 14.1 years
(range, 0.3-27 years) in the patients aged 40 years and
13.6 years (range, 0.8-27 years) in the control group.
Before 2001, the standard chemotherapy regimen
for disseminated GCC was 4 cycles of BEP; since 2001,
the standard regimen has been 3 cycles of BEP for
patients with a good prognosis and 4 cycles of BEP for
patients with an intermediate or poor prognosis.7 Bleomycin was discontinued if the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity corrected for hemoglobin (DLCO)
decreased >25% during treatment. Granulocyte-colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered to patients
who experienced febrile neutropenia; and, from 2007
onward, all patients aged 40 years routinely received
G-CSF because of a >20% risk of febrile neutropenia
according to the guidelines of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology.8
Thorough reviews of patient charts were performed.
Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), tobacco use, and alcohol consumption were recorded before treatment. Tobacco
consumption was categorized as nonsmoker, former
smoker, light smoker (20 cigarettes per day), or heavy
smoker (>20 cigarettes per day). Alcohol consumption was
categorized as nonuser, moderate consumption (21 U/12
grams per week), or heavy consumption (>21 U/12 grams
per week). The cumulated doses of BEP, including salvage
cycles, were recorded. Lung function tests (forced expiratory
volume in 1 second [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC],
and DLCO) were measured before every cycle; at the end
of chemotherapy; and at 1 to 2 years, 3 to 4 years, and 5
years after treatment. All measurements were compared
with the expected value according to patient age and height.
Renal function was estimated using chromium 51-ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid clearance at the same time points,
except during chemotherapy. Bone marrow toxicity
was graded on days 1, 8, and 15 during each cycle of
BEP and 1 month after the final cycle according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 (available at:
http:==ctep.cancer.gov=protocoldevelopment=electronic_
applications=docs=ctcaev3.pdf on the 10th of September
2013). Further testing was performed for CTC grade >3.

Disease progression was defined as the time from
treatment initiation to the first GCC-related event: either
disease relapse or GCC-specific mortality. The cause of
death was categorized as GCC, other malignancy, or other
cause.
Statistical Methods

Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used for tests of
independence, and the t test was used to compare continuous data between the 2 groups. Exact 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for proportions were calculated. KaplanMeier survival analysis was used to estimate the time to
disease progression, overall survival, and cancer-specific
survival; and log-rank analysis was used to compare survival between the study groups. Cox regression analysis
was used to estimate the risk of GCC death in the group
aged 40 years. The Schoenfeld test was used to assess the
Cox model assumptions. The expected overall survival in
the 2 groups was calculated using vital statistics
from Statistics Denmark (available at: http:==www.
statistikbanken.dk=statbank5a=default.asp?w51680,
accessed November 1, 2012) matched by age and the
year BEP was started. One sample log-rank test was done
comparing the observed survival with the expected survival in each group.9 All tests were 2-sided, and P values
< .05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical
analysis was performed with the SAS software package
(version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The distribution of seminoma in the patients aged 40 years was
higher compared with the control group; and, although
there were more patients aged 40 years with extragonadal tumors, the 2 groups were well matched according to
prognostic categories (P 5 .72). There were significantly
more current or previous smokers in the group aged 40
years (73%) compared with the control group (49%;
P < .001); more patients aged 40 years had higher alcohol consumption (P 5 .002); and, although the difference
was not significant, there was a trend toward higher CCI
in the group aged 40 years (P 5 .06). Baseline renal
function was significantly lower in the group aged 40
years (P < .001), whereas age-adjusted lung function was
comparable between the 2 groups.
Treatment Intensity and Toxicity

There were no differences in the accumulated doses of
chemotherapy received between the 2 groups (Table 2).

comparable, more patients aged 40 years received
reduced bleomycin doses based on a decrease in DLCO
(P 5 .03). Of the 25 patients aged 40 years who received
reduced bleomycin (median, 3 administrations; range, 112 administrations), there were 4 patients in the poor
prognostic group, 7 in the intermediate prognostic group,
and 14 in the good prognostic group. Five patients in the
good prognostic group received 3 cycles of cisplatin and
etoposide, and the remaining patients received 4 cycles.
Thus, the latter 9 patients were treated sufficiently despite
receiving reduced doses of bleomycin, leaving 16 patients
who did not receive the full dose. In the control group, of
14 patients who received reduced bleomycin (median, 2.5
Cancer

administrations; range, 1-7 administrations), there were 4
patients in the poor prognostic group, 2 in the intermediate prognostic group, and 8 in the good prognostic group.
Three patients in the good prognostic group received
4 cycles. Thus, 11 patients did not receive the doses of
bleomycin.
Bone marrow toxicity was modest; and, overall,
there were no difference between the 2 groups (Table 3).
However, 17% of patients aged 40 years experienced
CTC grade 4 leucopenia, including those patients who
received G-CSF prophylaxis, compared with 10% in the
control group (P 5 .02). When the comparison was performed after G-CSF was routinely administered to all
patients aged 40 years, this difference was eliminated. In
total, 2% of patients aged 40 years had treatment
delayed for more than 7 days compared with 2.2% in the
control group (P 5 .68). Generally, there were no differences in the mean percentage changes in lung function or
renal function between the 2 groups, and no episodes of
bleomycin pulmonary toxicity were observed.

The treatment response could be evaluated in 134 of the
135 patients aged 40 years and in all patients in the control group (Table 2). Three patients died during treatment—all were in the group aged 40 years: 1 patient
died 9 days after the initiation of treatment because of
“white lungs” (recorded as GCC death), 1 patient died
from a pulmonary embolism (this patient had unknown
treatment status and, thus, was excluded from treatment
evaluation), and the third patient died from septic shock
after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The latter death was not
related to leucopenia, and an autopsy revealed no evidence
of disease; thus, death in this patient was recorded as
“other cause.” In total, 106 of 134 patients (79.1%) aged
40 years had a complete response (CR) compared with
121 of 135 patients (89.6%) in the control group
(P 5 .05). Of the remaining patients aged 40 years,
13.4% had a partial response (PR), 6.7% developed progressive disease (PD) during treatment, and 1 patient died
of GCC during treatment (see above). In the control
group, 8.9% had a PR, and 1.5% had PD.
Of the 18 patients who achieved a PR in the group
aged 40 years, 13 patients had seminoma; and there
were 10 patients in the good prognostic group, 4 in the intermediate prognostic group, and 4 in the poor prognostic
group. Eleven patients were admitted for surgery, and 10
patients underwent only partial surgery, because radical
removal of the tumor was not possible. The other patient
had a malignant tumor in the removed specimen. Of the

achieved a PR underwent surgery with partial removal;
and the other patient was managed with cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. Two patients had seminoma; and
there were 2 patients in the good prognostic group and 5

In total, 20.1% (27 of 134 patients; excluding the patient
who died during treatment with unknown response) of the
group aged 40 years had PD compared with 12.6% (17
of 135 patients) of the control group (P 5 .06) (Fig. 1). The
median time to progression for patients in the group aged
40 years who initially obtained a CR or a PR was 0.8 years
(range, 0.2-8.4 years) after treatment. There were no
platinum-resistant relapses (1 month), whereas there were
7 late relapses (>2 years). In the control group, the median
time to progression was 0.9 years (range, 0.3-5.0 years). In
addition, no platinum-resistant relapses were observed in
the control group, whereas there were 4 late relapses. The 5year progression-free survival rate in the group aged 40
years was 79.8% (95% CI, 72.7%-86.9%) compared with
88% (95% CI, 82.5%-93.5%) in the control group (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.3).

Of the 17 patients who died of GCC in the group
aged 40 years (Table 2), there were 8 patients in the
good prognostic group (3 patients had PD during treatment; 2 patients who attained a PR progressed; 2 patients
who had a CR developed PD after 3 months and 4
months, respectively; and the remaining patient had a late
relapse). One patient in the intermediate prognostic
group achieved a PR and developed PD after 3 months;
and, of the 8 patients in the poor prognostic group, 5
developed PD during treatment, and 3 who achieved a PR
developed PD within 3 months. Of the 4 patients who
died of GCC in the control group (Table 2), 2 patients in
the good prognostic group had transformed teratoma to
sarcoma as part of their primary tumor and died of it, 1
patient in the intermediate prognostic group had a late
relapse, and 1 patient in the poor prognostic group primarily had a CR but developed PD after 4 months with
central nervous system metastases.
The estimated 5-year cancer-specific survival rate for
the patients aged 40 years was 88.2% (95% CI, 81.2%92.7%) compared with 97% (95% CI, 92.1%-98.8%) in
the control group (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.6-14.3; P 5 .005)
(Fig. 2). Patients who developed disease progression had
significantly increased GCC mortality in the group aged
40 years compard to the control group (P 5 .015).
Sixty-three percent (95% CI, 42.4%-80.6%) of patients
aged 40 years died of GCC compared with 23.5%
(95% CI, 6.8%-49.9%) of patients in the control group.

40 years was 82.5% (95% CI, 74.7%-88%) compared
with 97% (95% CI, 92.1%-98.8%) in the control group
(Fig. 3). The group aged 40 years had significantly
impaired 5-year overall survival compared with the
expected survival of the background population (96.3%;
P < .001), and the difference could not be explained
solely by GCC deaths. There was a trend toward impaired
survival in the control group compared with their
expected 5-year survival (99.4%; P 5 .044).
Subanalysis in Patients Aged 40 Years

Patients who had primary tumors in the testis had better
GCC survival compared with patients who had primary
extragonadal tumors (P 5 .007), which also was the case
for patients in the good prognostic group compared with
patients in the poor prognostic group (P < .0001). The
age at BEP treatment (P 5 .90), year of treatment
(P 5 .32), histology (P 5 .30), CCI (P 5 .99), tobacco
use (P 5 .10), alcohol consumption (P 5 .08), receipt of
prophylactic G-CSF (P 5 .61), number of treatment
cycles (P 5 .21), reduced doses of bleomycin (P 5 .11),
and decreased renal function (P 5 .18) were not associated significantly with GCC mortality. However, patients
with impaired lung function before treatment had
increased GCC mortality. Patients with <80% of the
expected FVC had an HR of 4.5 (P 5 .03); patients with
<80% of the expected DLCO had an HR of 4.6

(P 5 .02); and, although the difference was not significant, patients with <80% of the expected FEV1 had
increased GCC mortality (P 5 .05). Patients who received
reduced bleomycin doses had significantly lower baseline
FVC (P 5 .002) and FEV1 (P 5 .007); however because
of the limited number of GCC events, we were
not able correct for these differences in a multivariate
analysis.
DISCUSSION
The current study confirms that patients aged 40 years
have significantly increased GCC-specific mortality compared with a younger control group. This may be caused
by decreased sensitivity to treatment, because patients
aged 40 years have a significantly lower response rate to
BEP treatment as well as higher mortality if they develop
disease progression after BEP treatment. The increased
mortality was not caused by lower treatment intensity of
cisplatin=etoposide or treatment-related toxicity. However, fewer of bleomycin administrations were observed in
patients aged 40 years, and this may have affected GCC
mortality. Other factors associated with GCC-specific
mortality were decreased lung function and renal function
before BEP treatment as well as recognized risk factors,
such as poor prognostic group and primary extragonadal
tumor.10,11 The current results advocate against the
assumptions that the increased mortality in older patients
with testicular GCC is mainly because of reduced treatment intensity combined with increased treatmentrelated toxicity or a less favorable stage distribution.

Different biologic behavior of the tumors or increased
comorbidity also may be part of the explanation.4-6,12-14
In this study, the tolerability of BEP treatment was
similar in older and younger patients when the group
aged 40 years received G-CSF and the cumulated doses
of bleomycin were comparable in both groups. During
the entire study period, it was our standard to discontinue
bleomycin treatment if the DLCO declined >25% during treatment. This resulted in the omission of a median
of 3 bleomycin doses in 20.8% of patients aged 40 years
compared with the omission of a median of 2.5 bleomycin
doses in 10.6% of the control group (Table 2). Some
studies have reported increased bleomycin-related toxicity
in older patients with testicular GCC,15,16 and 1 report
even suggested that bleomycin should not be used routinely in patients aged 40 years who have testicular
GCC because of an increased risk of bleomycin-induced
pulmonary toxicity.17 However, this was not supported
by the current study, in which the majority of patients
aged 40 years tolerated full doses of bleomycin if their
lung function was monitored carefully. Although the difference was not significant, there was a trend toward
higher GCC mortality in patients aged 40 years who
received reduced doses of bleomycin in the current study,
in agreement with previous studies, which demonstrated
that bleomycin was an important part of GCC treatment,
because both disease-free and overall survival were superior when bleomycin was part of the treatment.7,18-21 In 2
recent studies, toxicity related to the treatment of GCC
was examined in patients aged 50 years.22,23 Both of
those studies reported that all chemotherapy-related toxicities were manageable, and a general chemotherapy dose
reduction in elderly patients has not been recommended.24 Our study supports this finding.
Although there was a trend toward higher CCI in
the group aged 40 years, the patients did not have substantial comorbidities in general, and we were not able to
demonstrate an association between CCI and GCC mortality. However, decreased lung function at baseline was
associated with increased GCC-specific mortality in
patients aged 40 years, suggesting that these patients tolerated bleomycin worse or that comorbidity not detectable with the CCI could be associated with a worse
prognosis.
Age has been suggested as an independent prognostic factor in Hodgkin lymphoma,25,26 in which the incidence peaks in the third and fourth decade and 80% of
patients are expected to be long-term survivors.26,27 For
older patients who are staged and treated in the same way
as younger patients, the risk of treatment failure is compa50

rable; however, older patients with relapse have a greater
Hodgkin disease-specific mortality.25 Like older patients
with GCC, it remains to be clarified whether age, comorbidity, or tumor biology plays the most important part in
the increased mortality. An increased toxicity related to
second-line treatment could also be considered.
Our control group comprised patients who were
randomly selected after being matched on year of BEP
treatment. More patients aged 40 years had seminomas
compared with the control group, as expected. Although
more patients aged 40 years had primary extragonadal
tumors, there were no significant differences regarding
prognostic groups. Therefore, we do not believe that
matching the control group on more parameters would
have changed our results. Again, because of the limited
number of GCC events, we have not been able to control
for the differences in a multivariate analysis.
Conclusions

Patients with disseminated GCC aged 40 years who
received standard chemotherapy had increased GCCspecific mortality compared with a younger control group
and had decreased overall survival compared with the
expected survival of the general population. This
increased mortality was not caused by treatment toxicity,
and there were no differences in the administrated doses
of cisplatin=etoposide, whereas the group aged 40 years
received a decreased number of bleomycin doses. Apart
from this, the inferior prognosis may be related to tumor
biology, increased comorbidity, or more severe toxicity in
relation to second-line treatment. Future studies should
further elucidate the role of tumor biology and comorbidity on mortality in older patients with GCC.
