BACKGROUND: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the renal side effects of crizotinib have not been investigated previously.
METHODS: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine-based prediction equation during the first 12 weeks of crizotinib therapy and after crizotinib but before the introduction of any further systemic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with stage IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer who were treated with crizotinib were identified. The mean eGFR decreased by 23.9% compared with baseline
(P <.0001; 95% confidence interval, 21.3%-26.6%), with the majority of the decrease occurring within the first 2 weeks of therapy. Clinical history and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios did not suggest prerenal causes. The objective response rate among evaluable
patients (n 5 27) was 41%. Tumor shrinkage was not correlated with changes in eGFR (correlation coefficient, 20.052; P 5.798).
Among the 16 patients for whom data after treatment with crizotinib were available, recovery to within 84% of the baseline eGFR
occurred in all patients. After adjusting for the number of scans with intravenous contrast and the use of known nephrotoxic drugs,
the issue of whether a patient was on or off crizotinib treatment was found to be significantly associated with changes in eGFR
(P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: As assessed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration prediction equation, eGFR is
reduced by treatment with crizotinib, but the majority of patients will recover their eGFR after the cessation of therapy. The early
onset, size of the change, minimal cumulative effect, and rapid reversibility raise the possibility that this may be a pharmacological
and/or tubular creatinine secretion effect rather than a direct nephrotoxic effect. Increased vigilance with regard to the concomitant
use of renally cleared medications or nephrotoxic agents should be considered for patients receiving crizotinib and, when eGFR is

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises 84% of all lung cancers and carries a 5-year survival rate of 18% (for all
disease stages).1 Between 2% and 7% of NSCLC is driven by an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene
(ALK-positive NSCLC), which is detectable through a variety of assays.2 In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration
granted accelerated drug approval to crizotinib (Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), a small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, based on
the drug’s ability to produce prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and high objective response rates (ORRs) in
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.2 In a follow-up phase 3 trial in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, crizotinib was
found to more than double PFS compared with standard chemotherapy and the drug was well tolerated, a finding that is
consistent with previous studies.3 Common adverse side effects reported in crizotinib trials include gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation), visual disturbances, and fatigue. The most common grade 3 to 4
side effects were neutropenia, transaminitis, hypophosphatemia, and lymphopenia.2-4 Since the approval of crizotinib, hypogonadism in males, asymptomatic bradycardia, and acute interstitial lung disease have also been noted.6-8 Herein we

describe what to our knowledge are the previously unreported side effects of a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) associated with crizotinib use and
explore its etiology in detail.3,4,9
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective review was conducted on a cohort of
patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC (AJCC 7th
Edition) who were treated with crizotinib between 2009
and 2012. The data were retrieved from patient electronic
medical records in accordance with a University of
Colorado Institutional Review Board-approved protocol
09-018 and data analysis was performed up to December
31, 2012.
The eGFR was determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
creatinine-based equation, as shown in Table 1.
This method was selected over the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease approach because CKD-EPI was
developed from a study population that included both
individuals without CKD as well as those with CKD. In
studies, the CKD-EPI prediction equation had greater accuracy and less bias compared with Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease for patients with a GFR > 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2, the measurement at which we expected our
study population to be at baseline.10,11
The median PFS with crizotinib therapy ranges
from 7.7 months to 9.7 months and the majority of objective responses occur at the first assessment scan.3,4 To
ensure adequate time for eGFR effects to manifest but
maximize the size of the data set for analysis, including for
correlations with tumor response, we focused on the first
12 weeks of crizotinib use. The percentage change in
eGFR during the first 12 weeks of therapy with crizotinib
was determined relative to baseline eGFR on the day of
the initiation of crizotinib treatment, and the eGFR after
crizotinib was determined compared with the eGFR on
the last day of crizotinib treatment.
Each record was examined for the use of drugs or
other agents that could alter renal function, including
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin

receptor blockers, diuretics, metformin, prior cisplatin/
carboplatin, and the use of intravenous (iv) contrast
(excluding fluorodeoxyglucose only) for imaging. Preexisting diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were
noted. Proteinuria was assessed using available urine dipstick results. Systolic blood pressure data and any documented emesis or diarrhea as graded according to version
3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were extracted from treatment visit notes. The ratios of blood urea nitrogen to
serum creatinine (BUN/Cr) were calculated for available
data in the first 2 weeks of therapy.
Statistical Analysis

The association between tumor shrinkage (determined
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) at the first imaging scan
and changes in the eGFR from baseline at the closest time
point to that imaging scan was examined using a Spearman correlation.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS/
STAT statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC). Longitudinal analyses of eGFR values were
performed using piecewise linear mixed models.12 These
models accounted for the correlation of repeated observations within a patient and allowed for a possible lack of
balance in the number and timing of measurements over
time. Each piece in the model was defined by a time point
(a “knot”) on either side of it, with knots at 2, 4, 6, 8, and
12 weeks for which creatinine data were available and a
normalized eGFR could be calculated. Between each set
of 2 consecutive knots, a regression line was fitted (a
“spline”) to determine the slope and thus the direction of
the change in eGFR. The mean difference in eGFR
between the spline’s beginning and ending knots was
determined using linear contrast (ie, week 2 vs baseline,
week 4 vs week 2, etc). Finally, P values were calculated
for each eGFR knot relative to baseline and relative to the
previous time piece to assess whether a difference in the
eGFR was statistically significant.
A subgroup of patients in the cohort was also analyzed for whom data regarding time spent “on/off”

crizotinib were available. In this cohort, ongoing clinical
and laboratory data were available after discontinuation of
crizotinib dosing due to either toxicity or disease progression but before the initiation of any additional systemic
anticancer therapy. In this subgroup, the percentage
change in the eGFR relative to the last day of crizotinib
treatment at the maximum time after crizotinib free of
any subsequent systemic therapy was compared with the
percentage change in the eGFR compared with the baseline value before crizotinib at the closest time-matched period on crizotinib. For the subset of patients who went off
therapy with crizotinib, a separate statistical model was fitted and corresponding estimates of changes in the eGFR
were obtained. To test the potential confounding effects
of iv contrast agents and other medications, matched outcome data for the eGFR while on and off crizotinib therapy were compared using a linear mixed-effects model
with a random patient effect and a fixed period effect
while controlling for the number of scans and other
medications.
RESULTS
A total of 38 patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC
were identified. As outlined in Figure 1, 27 of these
patients had measurable disease while receiving therapy
and 16 had “on/off” crizotinib data available. The demographics of these 2 cohorts are listed in Tables 2 and 3. All
666

patients commenced crizotinib treatment orally at the
standard dose of 250 mg twice daily. The median duration of crizotinib treatment was 16.3 months (range, 1
month-39 months). One patient with baseline severe renal failure (eGFR of 35.0 mL/minute/1.73 m2) secondary
to prior cisplatin therapy experienced several treatment
interruptions and dose reductions due to worsening
kidney function before eventually discontinuing the drug
in the absence of disease progression (Fig. 2). As data on
the detailed effects of crizotinib on the eGFR emerged,
this patient was rechallenged with additional measurements of renal function conducted prospectively before
and after recommencement of crizotinib (Fig. 2). Two
other patients required dose reductions in crizotinib due
to neutropenia (down to 200 mg twice daily and 150 mg
twice daily, respectively), whereas a third patient required
a dose reduction down to 200 mg twice daily due to transaminitis. In each case, the reduced dose was maintained
for the remainder of their treatment. All these patients
had received their first tumor assessment scan before the
dose reductions, except for the patient who experienced
transaminitis. For this patient, the dose was reduced after
the first cycle and occurred before the first assessment
scan.
Consistent with our selection of the CKD-EPI creatinine-based prediction equation for the eGFR, the mean
baseline eGFR for the cohort of 38 patients was 82.6 mL/

shown in Figure 3.
Dehydration or Additional Drug Use Does Not
Explain the Steep Drop in the eGFR Noted
Within the First 2 Weeks

Patients reported no significant gastrointestinal issues
during the first 2 weeks that would lead to volume depletion causing an acute kidney injury. None of the 38
patients experienced emesis during this time and 4 patients
reported only grade 1 intermittent diarrhea that was controlled with loperamide hydrochloride. Only 1 patient in
the cohort used diuretics during this period (furosemide
at a dose of 40 mg daily). At the 2-week clinic visit, none
of the patients had hypotensive blood pressure measurements and none had BUN/Cr ratios > 20:1 to suggest
prerenal causes for the impaired eGFR (mean BUN/Cr of
12.0, median of 11.6 [range, 6.6-18.9])
Tumor Lysis Does Not Account for the Change
in the eGFR Noted During Crizotinib Therapy

Consistent with prior reports of crizotinib’s activity, there
was a 41% ORR in the 27 patients in the cohort with
evaluable disease at the time of the first assessment scan

weeks] after the initiation of crizotinib).2-4 No correlation
was found between percentage tumor shrinkage at the first
assessment scan and the decrease in the eGFR at the closest time point to the radiographic assessment in these 27
patients (correlation efficient [r], 20.052; P 5 .798), as
illustrated in Figure 4.
Crizotinib Exposure Appears to Be Directly
Associated With the Change in the eGFR

In the on/off cohort (Table 4), a mean 15.9% drop in the
eGFR as determined by the CKD-EPI equation occurred
during the first 12 weeks of treatment with crizotinib
(P < .0001; 95%CI, 13.4%-18.4%). Similar to the overall
cohort, the greatest decrease occurred during the first 2
weeks of therapy (mean, 15.8%; P 5 .0001 [95% CI,
9.3%-22.3%]).
To explore possible confounders, this cohort was
further analyzed by comparing the eGFR at the maximum
668

time period that the patient was off crizotinib, and any
other chemotherapeutic drugs, with the equivalent time
period after starting the drug initially (the “time-matched
periods”). The median time off crizotinib in these patients
was 2.5 weeks (range, 1 week-12 weeks). There were no
significant differences in the exposure to iv contrast,
NSAIDs, or diuretics noted in the patients between the
on/off assessment periods (P 5 .325, P 5 .371, and
P 5 .587, respectively). No angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors were used in these patients during either the on or off crizotinib analysis periods.
At the time of ceasing treatment with crizotinib, the
eGFRs of the patients demonstrated an average 35.3% recovery (95% CI, 15.2%-55.4%) from the last treatment
day at the maximum time assessed off crizotinib
(P 5 .0018), as shown in Figure 5. At the equivalent timematched period on crizotinib, the mean decrease in the
eGFR compared with baseline was 15.2% (95% CI,
6.9%-23.5%). In this cohort, the eGFR was on average

with the last day of treatment) and change in the eGFR (compared with baseline) at an equivalent time-matched point during
treatment with crizotinib are shown (individual patient data; n 5 16).

Recovery of the eGFR Can Be Complete

When the eGFR at the maximum time off crizotinib was
normalized to the original baseline value (as opposed to
that on the last day of treatment), the mean eGFR
increased 18.9% over baseline (P 5 .047; 95% CI,
0.3%-37.4%), ranging from 216.0% to 84.2%. Recovery of the eGFR to baseline levels or above occurred in
56.3% of patients and the remaining 43.8% of patients
recovered to within 84% to 97% of their baseline eGFR
(Fig. 6). Advanced patient age did not appear to be a factor in the recovery because the median age among those
patients with complete recovery of their baseline eGFR
was 60 years, whereas among those patients with only
partial recovery the median age was 45.7 years. Baseline
renal impairment also did not limit recovery. In fact,
using a Spearman correlation test, patients’ recovery (represented by the maximum percentage change in the
eGFR after crizotinib compared with their baseline
value) was inversely correlated with their baseline eGFR
measurements (r, 20.68; P 5 .0036).
Prospective Renal Measurements Before and
During Crizotinib Therapy

NSCLC and preexisting renal impairment secondary to

associated with its use (Fig. 2). Due to increased awareness
of the potential reversibility and limited cumulative effect
of crizotinib on renal function generated from the data set
presented herein, approximately 17 months later it was
considered safe to cautiously rechallenge this patient with
crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily. On May 31,

serum creatinine was 2.09 mg/dL, his eGFR as calculated

response on his first positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan performed on July 23, 2013 and
was continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of last
follow-up. His last creatinine level, measured on July 24,
2013, was stably elevated at 2.67 mg/dL.

DISCUSSION
Crizotinib is a potent inhibitor of several different oncogenic kinases including ALK, ROS1, and MET.4,13,14
Crizotinib is a small molecule and is predominantly eliminated in the feces (63%) and urine (22%).9 Its use in
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC is associated with
ORRs of 57% to 65% and a median PFS of between 7.7
months and 9.7 months.2-4 Because disease progression
during crizotinib therapy can occur in either the central
nervous system through inadequate drug exposures or in
the rest of the body due to the selection of specific resistant
clones, local treatment of isolated areas of disease progression and the continued use of crizotinib for many months
after disease progression has also recently been
described.15,16 Consequently, the median duration of crizotinib exposure in many patients with ALK-positive disease may be considerably longer than the median PFS
described within the initial studies.
In the current study, we described a previously unreported side effect of crizotinib in relation to the drug
decreasing the eGFR as assessed by the CKD-EPI creatinine-based prediction equation. The mean eGFR was
reduced by 23.9% over the first 12 weeks of dosing with
crizotinib (P < .0001; 95% CI, 21.3%-26.6%). Because
of the routine monitoring of creatinine in these patients,
we were able to track the timescale of this effect. The
greatest reduction in the eGFR occurred during the first 2
weeks of therapy when the mean decrease in the eGFR
was 19.9% compared with baseline readings (P < .0001;
672

95% CI, 14.4%-25.4%). Cumulative effects beyond the
initial rapid reduction were rare (Fig. 3).
The current study was limited by its retrospective
design and the small sample size available for analysis, and
therefore several caveats need to be considered. Although
the rapidity and consistency of the effect strongly implicated crizotinib as the cause, other confounders have to be
ruled out. Patients with disease progression may lose
weight, or patients who are responding or developing peripheral edema (a known side effect of crizotinib) may
gain weight; however, weight is not involved in the CKDEPI calculation of GFR and therefore any such changes
should not have affected our eGFR readouts within the
current study. Patients did not have significant episodes of
hypotension, emesis, or diarrhea documented during the
time periods analyzed to account for the observed renal
impairment, and the BUN/Cr ratios did not suggest a prerenal cause. Crizotinib is an active drug, producing a 41%
ORR within our response-evaluable cohort at the time of
the first assessment scan. Although the majority of objective responses on crizotinib occur at the time of the first
assessment, later responses also can occur.2,4 Allowing for
this, the activity of crizotinib in the current study cohort
appears comparable to that noted within the literature.
Although tumor lysis in highly treatment-responsive
malignancies can be associated with acute kidney injury,
we found no correlation between the percentage of tumor
shrinkage as per RECIST and the amount of change in
the eGFR at the closest time point to the radiographic
assessment (r, 20.052; P 5 .798) (Fig. 4).17,18 Within a
subgroup of patients in whom we could capture eGFR
changes both on crizotinib and after a period of time after
therapy with crizotinib but before the introduction of any
other systemic anticancer therapy, we were able to isolate
the effect of crizotinib separate from exposure to other
potential nephrotoxic agents including NSAIDs, diuretics, and iv contrast from imaging studies (Table 4).
After treatment with crizotinib, the eGFR increased in 14
of 16 patients compared with the values on the last day of
crizotinib treatment (Fig. 5). Using a linear mixed-effects
model, the issue of whether a patient was on or off crizotinib therapy was found to be highly statistically significantly associated with the noted changes in the eGFR as
determined by the CKD-EPI equation (P < .0001). The
majority of patients start to experience improvements in
their eGFR within weeks of stopping crizotinib and this
recovery is complete in 56.3% of cases; for the remaining
43.8% of cases, the eGFR returns to within 84% to 97%
of the starting eGFR (Fig. 6). Because the duration of
time off crizotinib in this cohort was relatively short, with
Cancer

a median of 2.5 weeks (range, 1 week-12 weeks), and the
patients were likely to have had progressive disease and
may have been deteriorating physically as well, these data
may, if anything, underestimate the extent of eGFR recovery that is possible once patients are taken off crizotinib
therapy.
In the current study cohort, the median duration of
therapy was 16.3 months (range, 1 month-39 months),
but we focused only on the first 12 weeks of therapy.
Therefore, the question of whether the eGFR changes
during therapy would be more pronounced if we examined changes over a longer period of time has to be raised.
Certainly, the maximum decrease in the eGFR at any
time during therapy was higher than that during the first
12 weeks in some cases (data not shown). However, such
data could be biased by, for example, the intermittent use
of diuretics to address late-onset peripheral edema rather
than a true cumulative effect.4 In addition, because longitudinal analyses using piecewise linear mixed models
demonstrated that the majority of the eGFR changes
occur within the first 2 weeks of therapy and then plateau,
most of the relevant clinical data are likely to be contained
within our presented analyses (Fig. 3).
In terms of understanding the clinical significance of
these findings, we need to consider the basis of the eGFR
calculation within this study. Specifically, it is important
to remember that, although creatinine is mainly cleared
by glomerular filtration, 10% to 20% is also secreted by
the proximal tubule via the organic cation transporter 2 in
the proximal tubule of the kidney.19-21 The mechanism
for the decrease in the eGFR (as calculated by a rise in creatinine) while crizotinib is being administered is unclear
from the current study. However, given that the mean
decrease in the eGFR was 20% to 25% and that it
occurred rapidly and then plateaued and was largely reversible on cessation of dosing, direct nephrotoxicity
appears to be unlikely. Instead, it is tempting to speculate
that the effect either reflects direct inhibition of an as-yet
unknown kinase involved in renal function and/or that
this effect is due to interference with the tubular secretion
of creatinine. With regard to creatinine secretion, many
drugs are also substrates for organic cation transporters
and have been shown to act as competitive inhibitors of
creatinine at organic cation transporters, causing elevated
serum creatinine levels. For example, cimetidine has been
reported to cause an increase in creatinine of 20% to
30%, without a change in the true GFR as measured by
inulin clearance.22,23 Other studies have found similar
effects with both trimethoprim and pyrimethamine.24-27
Perhaps crizotinib might also act as a competitive inhibiCancer

tor at the creatinine transporter. In the patient described
herein, in whom we documented 24-hour urine collections before and after the administration of crizotinib, the
decrease in urinary creatinine (8%) was below the mean
reduction described in a previous detailed cimetidine
study (14%).28 However, it was still within the range of
urinary creatinine reductions reported (range, 0.3%35%).28 Unfortunately, we do not have paired data from
direct measurements of the GFR (eg, inulin studies or
iothalamate nuclear medicine scans) either before and
during or during and after treatment with crizotinib to
compare with our creatinine-based analyses to definitively
prove, or disprove, an effect of crizotinib on the tubular
secretion of creatinine. Without this information, an
effect on tubular creatinine secretion represents only one
plausible hypothesis.
Patients may remain on crizotinib for months or
even years, including ongoing use of the drug after the initial instance of disease progression.2,4,16 Consequently,
although its uncertain etiology and reversibility may justify cautiously continuing crizotinib in patients who are
deriving benefit from the drug and in whom creatinine
levels rise significantly outside of the normal range,
increased vigilance with regard to the concomitant use of
known nephrotoxic or renally cleared drugs in patients
receiving crizotinib is currently warranted. Because the
true mechanism underlying crizotinib’s effects on the
creatinine-based eGFR remains unknown, when the
eGFR is reduced and clinical decisions are being made
based on these results, additional renal investigations to
further define the true GFR in patients should be
considered.
