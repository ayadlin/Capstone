BACKGROUND. Epithelial–mesenchymal transformations (EMT) are critical for the
invasion, progression, and metastasis of epithelial carcinogenesis. The role of
EMT in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) tumorigenesis remains
unexplored. In the current study, the expressions of several factors associated
with the induction of EMT in HNSC cell lines and tumor specimens were investigated to define their functional and pathologic role in HNSC.

METHODS. Eleven HNSC cell lines and 50 primary tumor tissue specimens
formed the materials of this study. Western blot analysis as well as immunohistochemical, and functional techniques were used to assess the status of activated
Src (p-Src), E-cadherin, and vimentin in both cell lines and tumor tissues and the
results were correlated with patients’ clinicopathologic parameters.
RESULTS. The results demonstrated the inverse expression of p-Src and E-cad-

ead and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) is the fifth most
common malignancy worldwide.1,2 Because of the lack of survival improvement in patients with this cancer, considerable efforts
have been devoted to investigating the underlying molecular and
phenotypic events associated with head and neck squamous tumorigenesis to identify biomarkers for early detection and prognostic
stratifications. Previous studies of HNSC and other epithelial malignancies have largely been centered on studying tumor epithelial cell
aberrations. Such studies demonstrate a progressive accumulation
of genetic and epigenetic alterations during the phenotypic progres-

sion of preinvasive and invasive squamous carcinoma.3–8 Conversely, to our knowledge, events
related to cellular and architectural changes associated with invasion and interactions with host
stroma are grossly underinvestigated.
HNSCs manifest various phenotypic, invasive,
and biologic patterns as a result of either cellular
and/or stromal modification during development
and progression.9–16 Studies of epithelial malignancies have consistently demonstrated that loss of cell
adhesion and the acquisition of mesenchymal
features, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), precede their invasion and progression.16–20 EMT is a complex process induced by modifications of multiple pathways leading to a spectrum
of epithelial cellular changes including loss of polarity and cohesion, increased motility, and the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype.17 Of these changes,
alterations of the anchoring intercellular junctions
(adherins and desmosomes) are considered the hallmark of cancer invasion and progression.18,21–25 In
epithelial malignancies, and especially in squamous
carcinoma, the principal component of these adhesion molecules is the E-cadherin class.26
E-cadherin is a 120-kilodalton (kD), calciumbinding transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the
CDH1 gene located in chromosome 16q21.27 The
extracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts homophilically with adjacent cell receptors, whereas the
intracellular domain binds to catenins. The latter
interacts with the actin cytoskeleton to form tight
cell-cell junctions.28,29 During tumor progression,
E-cadherin can be functionally inactivated or silenced
by different mechanisms, including posttranslational
modification, somatic mutation, and/or transcriptional repression.30,31 The net effect of these events is
either loss, nonpolar or cytoplasmic localization, or
transcriptional repression of E-cadherin.32–35 Moreover, several studies have shown that E-cadherin plays
a transcriptional and regulatory role in invasion, metastasis, and poor outcome for several epithelial
malignancies, including HNSC.27,36–41
EMT can also be induced by a variety of cellular
growth factors and signaling pathways that may differ between tumor types.17,42,43 Of these pathways,
the protein tyrosine kinase Src is a common target of
different growth factor receptor activation in EMT.44
The Src family of proteins are nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases that play multiple roles in signal transduction of vital cellular functions.44,45 Constitutively,
active forms of Src, such as v-Src, have been reported
to be potent inducers of EMT.46,47 Src has also been
demonstrated to down-regulate both focal adhesions
(cell-matrix) and adheren molecule (cell-cell) interac-

tions, resulting in reduced cell contact and enhanced
cell migration.44,48–50 Moreover, evidence indicates
that Src-mediated phosphorylation induces ubiquitination and endocytosis of E-cadherin and directly
affects cell junction assembly and cell motility.51–53
In HNSC, Src expression has been reported to
induce proliferation in oral dysplastic epithelium and
invasive carcinoma.27,38 In addition, several Src family members (c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, and Lyn) are activated
by transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a) and the
induction of a high proliferative rate in HNSC cell
lines. Conversely, the in vitro inhibition of Src using
a kinase inhibitor and a dominant-negative construct
blocks TGF-a activation and reduces cell proliferation.54 Recently, in vitro treatment of human HNSC
cell lines with the Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib
resulted in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and decreased
cell invasion and migration.55–57 These data underscore the pleiotropic role of Src activation on cellular
functions in epithelial tumors, including HNSC.
However, to our knowledge, the spectrum of changes
associated with the EMT phenotype and whether Src
activation is obligatory for these changes in HNSC
have not been fully addressed.
We studied several biomarkers associated with
EMT in HNSC cell lines and tumor specimens to
determine their relation to invasion and progression
of these tumors. We demonstrate that Src activation
is associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin in
most, but not all, HNSC tumors and cell lines, suggesting that multiple factors regulate this phenotype
in these tumors.

tative tissue block(s) for immunohistochemical analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Tissue samples were thawed and homogenized in
Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate [volume/
weight], 2 mM of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
[EDTA], 2 mM NaVO5, and protease inhibitor cocktail), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by
Western blot analysis. The intermediate filament
antiactin was used routinely as a loading control.
Protein lysates were obtained by incubating cells in
lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 250 mM KCl,
0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM ethyleneglycol tetraacetic
acid [EGTA], 0.1% NP40 and 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM
NaF, 0.1 mM NaVO4, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL aprotinin, and
0.1 mg/mL leupeptin) for 20 minutes at 48C. Proteins
were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with Trisbuffered saline (TBS) containing 5% skim milk for
2 hours and then incubated overnight (48C) with the
primary antibodies. The following antibodies were
used for Western blotting immunohistochemistry:
anti-E-cadherin, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), antimouse and rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif), phospho-Src (p-Src), total Src, phosphoEGFR, (Cell Signaling, Beverly, Mass), vimentin, (BD
Bioscience, San Jose, Calif), and antiactin (Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-lm paraffin-embedded invasive squamous carcinoma and
dysplasia tissue sections from 21 patients. After
deparaffinizing and hydrating to phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4), the sections were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide (3%) for 10 minutes
to remove endogenous peroxidase, followed by antigen retrieval via stem bath for 20 minutes in EDTA.
A primary antibody was applied, followed by washing
and incubation with the biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. Detection
was performed with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and
counterstaining with Mayer hematoxylin followed by
dehydration and mounting. Immunostaining was
scored semiquantitatively by assessing the staining
localization and intensity in tumor cell dysplastic epithelium for comparison with those of adjacent nondysplastic squamous epithelium. The staining was

then categorized into: 0, none; 1, up to 10% staining;
2, 11% to 50% staining; and 3, >50% staining).

Soft Agar Assay
The 2-layer agarose gel assay was performed on
Costar 6 well plates. The lower gel was prepared by
mixing a 3% agarose solution, 23 DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and serum-free, supplemented
DMEM at a ratio of 2:5:1:2. The top gel consisted of
a 1.5% low melt agarose solution, FBS, 23 DMEM,
and serum-free, supplemented DMEM mixed at a ratio of 1:4.6:1.4:2. The cells were maintained in an incubator at 378C in 5% carbon dioxide for 4 weeks
and refed every 5 days. After 4 weeks, 100 lL of
2 mg/mL MTT was added to each well and the plates
were incubated for 4 hours in 5% carbon dioxide at
378C. At this time, the cells staining positive with
MTT were visualized by microscopy. Head and neck
cell line TR146 with high levels of p-Src and low
levels of E-cadherin was incubated with increasing
concentrations (0–10 lM) of Src inhibitor PP2. After
72 hours, the cell numbers were counted for proliferation.
Migration Assay
To measure cell migration potential, TR146 cells
were trypsinized in PBS, resuspended in medium in
the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and loaded on the upper well of an uncoated Boyden
chamber at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well.
When indicated, PP2 (20 lm) was added to the cell
medium and the lower side of the separating filter
was filled with conditioned medium of NIH-3T3
fibroblasts grown in DMEM/F-12 medium with 0.1%
BSA. The number of cells that successfully migrated
through the filter was counted.
Immunofluorescent Labeling and Confocal Microscopy
The cellular localization of E-cadherin and p-Src proteins was accomplished by indirect immunofluorescence. Briefly, TR1467 cells were grown on coverslips
and treated with PP2 for 24 hours. Cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were incubated with E-cadherin and phospho-Src antibodies
and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa-488 (green) from Molecular Probes
(Eugene, Ore). The DNA dye Topro-3 (Molecular
Probes) was used for nuclear localization (blue). Microscopic analyses were performed using an Olympus (New Hyde Park, NY) FV300 laser scanning
confocal microscope in accordance with established
methods, using sequential laser excitation to minimize the possibility of fluorescence emission bleedthrough.

are representative of 3 experiments with similar results.

RESULTS
Expression of Signaling Molecules in Head and Neck
Cancer Cell Lines
We initially screened cell lines and selected tumor
specimens for TGFb, snail, slug, p-EGFR, EGFR, keratins, integrins Src, p-Src, FGF-2, and b-catenin by
Western blot analysis (data not shown). Of these
markers, we demonstrated differential expression of
limited Src, EGFR, E-cadherin, and vimentin. Figure
1 presents the Western blot results of some of these
proteins in head and neck cancer cell lines. Of the 7
cell lines, 5 were derived from primary tumors and 2
from lymph node metastasis of squamous carcinomas. To examine markers for EMT levels of total Src,
pY-418Src, E-cadherin, EGFR, p-EGFR, vimentin, keratin, TGFb, and integrin proteins were assessed in
HNSC cell lines. The results demonstrated a differential expression pattern in some but not all markers of
EMT. We noted that p-Src expression was inversely
expressed with E-cadherin in 5 of these lines,
whereas EGFR expression was found with variable
intensities in the 7 cell lines.
Expression of Src, E-cadherin, and EGFR in Human Head
and Neck Cancer Specimens
To determine whether the same pattern of expression
also occurred in primary tumor tissues, Src, E-cadherin, and EGFR expression in fresh-frozen primary
resected HNSC of the tongue, oral cavity, and base of
tongue with matching histologically normal squamous epithelium tissue were analyzed. The level of
Src activation was examined with a monoclonal antibody recognizing tyrosine phosphorylation of Y416.
Total Src expression, but not its activity, was found to

be elevated in several tumors and these tumors
demonstrated high E-cadherin (Fig. 2). These results
are consistent with the requirement for activated Src
for increased E-cadherin turnover.45,46 In contrast to
Src, EGFR expression was found to be correlated
with its phosphorylation, both being increased in the
majority of tumors. These results suggest that in
HNSC, E-cadherin down-regulation is more closely
associated with Src activation than with EGFR activation.

Expression of Microdissected Tumor and
Matching Stroma
To determine the relative contribution of the epithelial and mesenchymal elements to the level of E-cadherin, p-Src, total Src, p-EGFR, total EGFR, and
vimentin of matched microdissected tumor and
stroma were evaluated. The results demonstrated
variable patterns of E-cadherin and p-Src proteins in
tumor specimens. In general, high levels of p-Src
were found to be associated with either lack or low
levels of E-cadherin; in a few tumors, both levels
were elevated. In the stroma, increased p-Src levels,
p-EGFR, and vimentin expression was noted in
multiple tumor specimens (Fig. 3). The data suggest
that increased Src activity is associated with either
quantitative and/or qualitative down-regulation of
E-cadherin.
In Vitro Effect of the Src Inhibitor PP2 on Proliferation of
HNS Cell Line
PP2, a nonspecific Src inhibitor, was used to determine the effect of activated Src inhibition on tumor
cell lines. The PP2 concentration required for 50%
cell growth inhibition (IC50) was found to be approximately 1 lM for TR146 and H3113 cell lines. PP2

treatment led to increased E-cadherin protein,
decreased p-Src (Fig. 4A), and a marked reduction in
cell migration (Fig. 4B). At the cellular level, PP2
treatment resulted in the increase of cell cohesion
(Fig. 5A), an increase in membranous staining of
E-cadherin, a decrease in p-Src cytoplasmic expression, loss of cellular spikes, and an increase in cellcell contact (Fig. 5B).

analysis demonstrated the increase in the expression of E-cadherin after

Effect of Src siRNA on Cell Proliferation
Src si-RNA clones led to a decrease in p-Src expression (Fig. 6A) and a reduction in cell proliferation of
DM12 cell line (Fig. 6B); no apparent changes in
E-cadherin expression were noted as a result of si-RNA
treatment (data not shown). Because the nonspecific
Src inhibitor (PP2) treatment led to E-cadherin
expression in the cell line, we attribute the results to
either the involvement of other Src family members
or to an incomplete knockout of Src by si-RNA.
Immunohistochemistry
Normal squamous epithelium
Distinct membranous expression of E-cadherin was
observed mainly in the suprabasal layers of the histologically normal squamous epithelium (Fig. 7B).
For p-Src, faint to weak membranous staining restricted to the basal cell layer was noted (Fig. 7C).

analyzed for E-cadherin and phospho-Src (p-Src) by Western blot analysis.
Results indicated that with the inhibition of Src activation, E-cadherin levels
increased. (B) Effect of the Src inhibitor PP2 on cell migration in TR146 and

individual tumor cell invasive fronts (Fig. 11B).

under a phase contrast microscope. (B) Immunofluorescent staining for E-cadherin and phospho-Src (p-Src). Immunofluorescent staining for p-Src and E-cadherin in TR146 cells demonstrated an increase in E-cadherin levels after treatment with PP2 compared with control cells. Before PP2 treatment, the TR146 cell
line displayed extensive cell border spikes, whereas after PP2 treatment the spikes disappeared and cells tended to adhere together.

p-Src. The staining of p-Src was weak to moderate
and paradoxical to that of E-cadherin in well and
moderately differentiated tumors (Figs. 8C and 9C)
and the broad-based invasive fronts had even lower
to focal intermediate membranous staining. The
staining was higher than normal and membranous in
poorly differentiated and sarcomatoid phenotypes
and the infiltrative finger-like invasive fronts (Figs.
10C and 11C).
Vimentin. The cytoplasmic staining of vimentin was
negative to faint in well and moderately differentiated tumors and in the broad-based and smooth

invasive tumor fronts. Increased cytoplasmic staining
of vimentin was more detectable in poor and sarcomatoid squamous tumors in the majority of fingerlike invasive tumor boundaries. Sarcomatoid carcinomas manifested the lowest E-cadherin with high Src
and intense vimentin expressions (Figs. 77D–11D).40

human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by in situ
hybridizations including the 4 base of tongue carcinomas. None of the tumors were positive for HPV.
Table 1 presents the correlation between the staining
patterns of E-cadherin, p-Src, and vimentin and clinicopathologic factors. Significant statistical correlation between Src activation and finger-like invasive
tumor fronts, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and high stage were noted (Table 1). Similarly, there was highly significant correlation detected
between vimentin expression and finger-like invasive
fronts (P 5 .004). Poor differentiation (P 5 .01) and
marginally with lymph node (P 5 .08) and stage
(P 5 .09) were noted.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate an
inverse correlation between p-Src and E-cadherin
expression in several cell lines and primary squa-

mous carcinoma specimens. In the majority of cell
lines and tumor specimens, activated Src was associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin and the
detection of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker in tumor cells, substantiating an association between
these proteins and EMT in HNSC. However, some
cell lines and tumor specimens demonstrated no
apparent difference between these markers, suggesting that other pathways exclusive of the Src activation may play a role in the regulation of E-cadherin.
The in vitro results of certain cell lines indicated that
Src inhibition leads to reexpression of E-cadherin,
decreased cell migration, and increased cell-cell contact. These findings are in agreement with previous
studies of other epithelial malignancies and further
support an important role for Src activation in the
down-regulation of E-cadherin and the induction of
EMT.27–38,46–49,51 Although the exact mechanism of
the Src effect is unknown, recent evidence indicates
that Src activation results in E-cadherin internalization and ubiquitination through tyrosine phosphorylation and lysosomal degradation.47,48,58
We also observed that the level of E-cadherin
expression varied in and between cell lines and tumor specimens, reflecting either quantitative and/or
qualitative changes during HNSC invasion and progression. In general, the level of E-cadherin expression in carcinoma, albeit less than normal squamous
epithelium, was associated with weak or absent p-Src
and a lack of vimentin expression in the majority
of well-differentiated and moderately differentiated
tumors. However, in poorly differentiated carcinomas, high activated Src and low or absent E-cadherin
and the detection of cytoplasmic vimentin predominated. The results also demonstrated membranous
and cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin protein in
some carcinomas along with high expression of activated Src, suggesting that qualitative as well as quantitative changes of E-cadherin occur in tumor cells.
These findings are in agreement with previous studies of E-cadherin expression and association with
aggressive tumor features.31–35
The results also indicate, as previously reported,
that Src activation is significantly associated with
tumor progression and aggressive features.59 Tumors
manifesting high p-Src were found to be predominantly poorly differentiated and were characterized
by finger-like invasive fronts. In addition, Src inactivation in HNSC cell lines led to decreased cell migration proliferation, underscoring the pleiotropic
cellular effects of this gene.45,46 This, along with evidence that phosphorylated Src induces mechanical
changes of epithelial cells including migration, transformation, and invasion, further link Src activation to

Although the results of the current study underscore the intrinsic cellular modifications of the EMT,
the host microenvironment may also contribute sig-

nificantly to this process. Microdissected stroma in
some of our samples showed elevated p-Src and pEGFR, suggesting that stromal changes may also contribute to tumor phenotype. Recent studies have

cellular milieu maintains a noninvasive phenotype,
whereas a harsh/heterogeneous host permits aggressive clonal development and invasive phenotype.64
These studies, when validated, present an attractive
concept for therapeutic strategies targeting the
epithelial and/or the microenvironment components.
The results of the current study provide evidence
for the involvement of activated Src in the down-regulation of E-cadherin and the EMT transformations
in HNSC. Based on these molecular and phenotypic
findings, we contend that the epithelial and host elements undergo variable qualitative and quantitized
changes in critical factors of different cellular pathways during squamous tumorigenesis. These changes
take place not only in early preinvasive dysplastic
lesions before invasion, but also persist and contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor phenotypes during tumor progression. Interrupting the
EMT process in early and late stages of tumorigenesis can form a new target for a novel strategy for
early treatment of preinvasive lesions and arresting
invasive tumor and metastasis.
In conclusion, the current study data indicate
that the modification of the EMT phenotype in
HNSC is characterized by loss of E-cadherin, elevated
p-Src, and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers
and phenotype. These findings support that Src may
either indirectly and/or independently modulate Ecadherin expression and function. The pathomorphologic observations in primary carcinoma specimens lend further credence to the association of
these markers with EMT in invasive HNSC and its
aggressive features. The association of the inhibition
of Src activity with decreased proliferation and invasion of HNSC cell lines further highlights the vital
role of Src in the biology of these tumors and provides evidence of the future therapeutic potential of
anti-Src molecules in these tumors.
