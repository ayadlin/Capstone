ABSTRACT
Zfra is a 31-amino-acid zinc finger-like protein, which participates in the tumor
necrosis factor signaling. Here, we determined that when nude mice and BALB/c mice
were pre-injected with nanogram levels of a synthetic Zfra1–31 or truncated Zfra4–10
peptide via tail veins, these mice became resistant to the growth, metastasis and
stemness of melanoma cells, and many malignant cancer cells. The synthetic peptides
underwent self-polymerization in phosphate-buffered saline. Alteration of the Ser8
phosphorylation site to Gly8 abolished Zfra aggregation and its-mediated cancer
suppression in vivo. Injected Zfra peptide autofluoresced due to polymerization and
was trapped mainly in the spleen. Transfer of Zfra-stimulated spleen cells to naïve mice
conferred resistance to cancer growth. Zfra-binding cells, designated Hyal-2+ CD3CD19- Z cells, are approximately 25–30% in the normal spleen, but are significantly
downregulated (near 0–3%) in tumor-growing mice. Zfra prevented the loss of Z cells
caused by tumors. In vitro stimulation or education of naïve spleen cells with Zfra
allowed generation of activated Z cells to confer a memory anticancer response in naïve
or cancer-growing mice. In particular, Z cells are abundant in nude and NOD-SCID mice,
and can be readily activated by Zfra to mount against cancer growth.

and is similar to C2H2 type zinc finger proteins [1–4].
Zfra participates in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)mediated apoptosis [1–5]. When transiently overexpressed
in vitro, Zfra induces growth suppression and apoptosis
of many types of cells probably by activating and
interacting with adaptor proteins in the TNF signal

INTRODUCTION
By functional cloning, we have previously isolated a
31-amino-acid Zfra (zinc finger-like protein that regulates
apoptosis) [1–4]. This small protein possesses two
cysteines and one histidine in the amino acid sequence,

pathway, including TNF receptor-associated death domain
protein (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain protein
(FADD), and receptor-interacting protein (RIP). Zfra
also binds nuclear factor NF-κB, cJun N-terminal kinase
1 (JNK1), and tumor suppressors p53 and WW domaincontaining oxidoreductase (WWOX, FOR, or WOX1)
[1–4]. Probably due to its small size, Zfra is capable of
interacting with both the N- and C-termini of WWOX
[2, 6–10].
In response to UV light, the endogenous level of Zfra
is upregulated [1–3]. Zfra becomes Ser8 phosphorylated and
translocates mainly to the nuclei [3]. Interestingly, induction
of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by staurosporine
or betulinic acid, Zfra becomes Ser8-phosphorylated
and translocates to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis
[3, 4]. Alteration of Ser8 abolishes relocation of Zfra to the
mitochondria and no cell death occurs [3, 4]. Zfra exhibits
an intriguing characteristic in inducing the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis. We have determined that transiently
overexpressed Zfra significantly downregulates Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL, blocks cytochrome c release from the mitochondria,
and yet induces dissipation of mitochondrial membrane
potential, thus leading to apoptosis [3, 4]. This novel
finding runs against a general belief that suppression of
apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL results in spontaneous
cytochrome c release and causing apoptosis [11, 12]. One
of the mechanisms for Zfra inhibition of cytochrome c
release is that transiently overexpressed WWOX induces
cytochrome c release, and that Zfra binds and blocks the
function of WWOX [3]. In light of the in vitro findings,
here we examined the functional properties of Zfra in vivo.
We showed that pre-treatment of mice with synthetic Zfra
peptides, either full-length or truncated, results in protection
of mice against the growth of many types of cancers.

We examined whether Zfra exerts anticancer activity
in vivo. Many types of malignant or metastatic cancer cells
were chosen to address whether Zfra suppresses cancer
growth, stemness, and metastasis. In general, breast, brain,
skin, and lung cancer cells were mainly used in this study.
T cell-deficient nude mice were pre-injected with 100 μl
of the full-length Zfra1–31 at 2 mM in sterile PBS or
PBS only via tail veins once per week for 3 weeks. These
mice were allowed to take a rest for a week, and then
inoculated with skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cells at
both the right and left flanks. Compared to controls, Zfra
blocked BCC growth by greater than 50% (Figure 1B). In
end-point experiments, tumor suppression by Zfra1–31 is
65 ± 17% (n = 6). All synthetic peptides for this and the
following experiments were prepared in degassed sterile
MilliQ water as 10 mM stocks and kept in a –80oC freezer.
Diluted peptides in degassed sterile MilliQ water or PBS
were freshly prepared for tail vein injections.
Similarly, pre-injection of nude mice with Zfra1–
31 twice via tail veins, followed by inoculating with
malignant glioblastoma U-87-MG cells a week later,
resulted in suppression or prevention of cancer growth
(Figure 1C or Supplementary Figure S2A). However,
Zfra1–31 did not suppress the growth of glioblastoma
13–06-MG cells in nude mice (Supplementary Figure
S2B). Direct intratumor injection of Zfra1–31 to a solid
malignant breast cancer MDA-MB-435s suppressed the
cancer growth by greater than 80% (Figure 1C). The
observations suggest that the T-cell defective immune
system in nude mice can be activated or charged by Zfra
for the anticancer response.
To elucidate how Zfra undergoes self-polymeri­
zation, Zfra peptides of amino acid #1–15 (Zfra1–15)
and #16–31 (Zfra16–31) were made. The peptides
were dissolved in sterile MilliQ water and incubated
alone at room temperature for 48 hr. Low levels of
polymerization were shown in these peptides (see lanes
1 and 2 in Figure 2A). When both peptides were mixed
and incubated together, dramatic polymerization of
Zfra1–15 with Zfra16–31 occurred in a ladder-like pattern
under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (lane
3 in Figure 2A). The observations suggest that Zfra1–15
and Zfra16–31 directly interact with each other. Since
reducing conditions did not break apart the polymers,
specific amino acid residues, other than cysteines (e.g.
Cys9 and Cys12), in both peptides are involved in the
polymerization. When Zfra1–15 and Zfra16–31 were
mixed in sterile MilliQ water and then delivered in nude
mice via tail veins, effective blocking of malignant breast
MDA-MB-231 cell growth occurred (Figure 2B). Similar
results were observed when both peptides were suspended
in PBS (data not shown). Under similar conditions,
the peptide mixtures in sterile MilliQ water were less
effective in blocking of the growth of lung NCI-H1299
cells (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
Synthetic Zfra peptide polymerizes in PBS
and blocks skin cancer growth, metastasis, and
stemness in vivo
The full-length Zfra1–31 peptide was synthesized.
The sequence is: NH-MSSRRSSSCKYCEQDFRAHTQ
KNAATPFLAN-COOH, where Ser8 is a known
phosphorylation site [2, 3]. In MilliQ water, Zfra1–
31 went into solution (at 1–10 mM) without visible
precipitation. However, when Zfra peptide was suspended
in degassed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at greater
than 5 mM, Zfra went out of solution and became visible
precipitates in less than 5 hr (Supplementary Figure S1).
Similar results were observed by dissolving Zfra peptide
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). By reducing SDS-PAGE,
monomeric Zfra of 3.5 kDa was shown to polymerize up
to 80 kDa and higher in a stepwise manner, as stained by
Commassie blue and silver stain (Figure 1A).

Alteration of Ser8 to Gly8 in Zfra1–15(S8G) abolished its
polymerization in PBS (Figure 3A). Again, Zfra16–31 was
less effective (Figures 2A and 3A).
Nude mice received the Zfra4–10 peptide or sterile
MilliQ water via tail veins, followed by resting for a week
and then inoculating with BCC (Figure 3B). Compared
with control mice, Zfra4–10-treated mice resisted
the growth of BCC by greater than 75% suppression
(Figure 3B). Zfra1–15 exerted a similar extent of cancer
growth suppression (data not shown). Alteration of Ser8

We investigated the shortest functional segment(s) in
Zfra to block cancer growth in vivo. By sequential deletion
and functional testing in vivo, a synthetic 7-amino-acid
Zfra4–10 peptide (RRSSSCK) was determined to be
functionally active in suppressing skin cancer growth.
Zfra4–10 effectively underwent ladder-like polymerization
in PBS but much less effective in water (Figure 3A). This
peptide is within the sequence of Zfra1–15, and Zfra1–
15 also underwent partial ladder-like polymerization

further polymerization, provided a complete suppression
(Figure 3C). At higher concentrations (> 2mM), overly
polymerized or aggregated Zfra4–10 failed to exert its
anticancer effect (data not shown). However, preparation
of Zfra4–10 in sterile MilliQ water was sufficient to block
the growth of breast MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 3D),

was not effective. Control mice were treated with sterile MilliQ water only. A representative data from an average of 2 tumors for each
experiment is shown. In end-point experiments, B16F10 tumor suppression by Zfra4–10 is 85 ± 12% (mean ± standard deviation from 12
tumors in controls and 12 tumors in experiments). Similar results were observed when Zfra4–10 was suspended in sterile PBS and used for
experiments. (C) Zfra4–10 peptides were freshly resuspended in 100 μl sterile PBS, or the preparations incubated overnight (o/n), prior to

suggesting that depending upon cancer cell types, Zfra4–
10 may act differently in blocking their growth.

to be protective for the growth of many types of cancer
cells [13–15]. In contrast, monomeric TIAF1 acts
synergistically with tumor suppressor p53 and WWOX
to counteract cancer growth and migration, whereas
both tumor suppressors may have loss-of-function or
completely disappeared in metastatic cancer cells [14,
15]. In parallel experiments, Zfra suppressed the stemness
of B16F10 cells in the lungs of nude mice by blocking
the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers Oct-4 and
SSEA-4 (Figure 4B). In control nude mice, expression of
Oct-4 and SSEA-4 was observed (Figure 4B).
We examined whether Zfra works in immune
competent BALB/c mice. These mice were received
Zfra4–10 or sterile MilliQ water via tail vein injections
in 3 consecutive days. Following resting for one week,
these mice were injected with B16F10 cells via tail veins.
B16F10 cells were shown to grow in the lung in the
control mice, but not in the Zfra-treated mice (data not
shown). The results are in parallel with the inhibition of
B16F10 metastasis to the lung in the Zfra-treated nude

Zfra4–10 suppresses melanoma growth,
metastasis and stemness
Next, we examined whether Zfra regulates
melanoma growth and metastasis. Nude mice were
pre-injected with sterile MilliQ water or Zfra4–10 (2
mM in 100 μl sterile water) for 3 consecutive weeks,
followed by resting for 2 weeks and then inoculating
with malignant melanoma B16F10 cells (Figure 4A).
Compared to controls, Zfra effectively blocked the
growth of B16F10 and metastasis to the lung (Figure
4A). TGF-β-induced antiapoptotic factor (TIAF1), which
is known to form fibrous materials in many types of
cancer tissues [13–15], was upregulated in the lung of
the control mice during cancer metastasis, as determined
by immunohistochemistry (Figure 4A). The fibrous
materials are associated with collagen and are considered

mice (Figure 4A). Indeed, alterations of Zfra4–10 amino
acid sequence abolished its self-polymerization and
anticancer function. The alterations included deletion of
Arg4 and Cys9 and/or adding a phosphate group to Ser8.
That is, peptides used for these experiments were Zfra5–
10, Zfra1–15(S8G), Zfra4–10(pS8), Zfra5–10(ΔC9),
Zfra5–10(ΔC9/pS8), and WWOX28–42 (as a control
peptide). Under similar conditions, none of these peptides
underwent polymerizations and failed to block B16F10
growth in nude mice (data not shown).

Zfra4–10 or sterile water 3 times, and then inoculated
with prostate cancer PZ-HPV-7 cells, respectively, 1
week and 3 months later. Zfra4–10 completely blocked
the growth of PZ-HPV-7 cells (100% inhibition; Figure
5C). PZ-HPV-7 is a non-invasive, virus-transformed
epithelial cells derived from the peripheral zone of the
prostate [16].
Also, Zfra4–10 effectively suppressed the growth of
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (>70% inhibition; Figure
5D). There was a 3-month resting period between Zfra4–
10 injection and SH-SY5Y inoculation, further attesting
that Zfra-induced anticancer activity is memorized
in the T cell-deficient nude mice. We have developed
knockout mice for tumor suppressor gene Wwox [17, 18].
Heterozygous Wwox+/– appeared to spontaneously
develop tumors around 9 months old. Zfra completely
cured the cancer in 50 days, and the successful rate was
70% by examining 10 mice (Figure 5E).
Finally, malignant glioblastoma cells showed
different susceptibility to Zfra. In agreement with the
aforementioned observations, both Zfra1–31 and Zfra4–
10 effectively prevented the growth of glioma U-87-MG
cells (~60% inhibition; Figures 1C, 5A and Supplementary
S2A), but had no inhibitory effects on 13–06-MG and CNS1 glioma cells (Figure S2B, S2C). In similar experiments,
Zfra1–15 and Zfra16–31 in combination did not block the
growth of glioma 13–06-MG cell growth but effectively
prevented cancer metastasis to the lung (Supplementary
Figure S3A, S3B). This is in agreement with the
observation for Zfra complete inhibition of B16F10 cell
migration and homing to the lung, along with suppression
of cancer stemness (Figure 4).

Zfra4–10 induces a memory anticancer response
against many types of cancer cells in vivo
We examined a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines
and determined whether Zfra4–10 blocks the cancer
growth in vivo, and showed that Zfra4–10 induced a
memory anticancer response. T cell-deficient nude mice
were pretreated with Zfra4–10. A month later, these mice
were inoculated with malignant glioma U-87-MG cells on
both flanks. Zfra-treated mice resisted the growth of U-87MG cells (40–50% inhibition; Figure 5A). The one-month
resting period did not result in reduction of the efficacy of
Zfra in suppressing cancer growth.
Additionally, nude mice were challenged with
Zfra4–10 and then inoculated with malignant prostate
cancer DU145 cells 3 months later. The results showed
that Zfra4–10 completely blocked the growth of the
implanted DU145 cells in nude mice (100% inhibition;
Figure 5B), suggesting that Zfra-activated anticancer
event is memorized in the mice. Under similar conditions,
immune competent BALB/c mice were pretreated with

(2 and 4 mM, or 10 and 20 μg, in 100 μl sterile MilliQ water) or sterile water via tail veins once per week for 3 weeks. One month later, the mice
were inoculated with glioma U-87-MG cells. (B) Nude mice received Zfra4–10 (2 mM in 100 μl sterile water) or sterile MilliQ water via tail veins
once per week for 4 weeks. Three months later, these mice were inoculated with malignant prostate cancer DU145 cells. (C) BALB/c mice were preinjected with sterile MilliQ water or Zfra4–10 (2 mM in 100 μl sterile water) in 3 consecutive weeks, followed by inoculating non-invasive prostate
PZ-HPV-7 cancer cells 7 and 70 days later, respectively. Tumor sizes were measured daily. (D) Nude mice were pre-injected with sterile MilliQ
water or Zfra4–10 (3 mM in 100 μl sterile water) in 3 consecutive weeks. Two months later, mice were inoculated with neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells at 2 subcutaneous sites on both flanks. For above experiments (A–D), a representative data set is shown from 2–4 experiments. (E) Shown is
a heterozygous Wwox+/- mouse with exon 2–4 ablation and spontaneously developing tumor in the abdominal area. Via tail vein injection (see red
triangles), Zfra4–10 (2 mM in 100 μl sterile water) completely cured the tumor in 50 days. Ten mice were examined and the cure rate was 75%.

Spleen memory cells are responsible for Zframediated cancer suppression

Figure S5B). Zfra is not toxic to animals, and that
Zfra-treated mice can live for their entire life span (data
not shown). The observations suggest that Zfra induces
memory spleen cells to block cancer growth.
To test the hypothesis that memory spleen cells
participate in Zfra-mediated cancer suppression, spleen
cells from control and Zfra-treated nude mice were
isolated and transferred to naïve mice via tail veins.
These mice were then allowed to rest for 1 week or 1
month, followed by inoculation with BCC. Naïve nude
mice received Zfra-treated spleen cells became more
resistant to the growth of BCC xenografts than those
mice received control spleen cells (Figure 6B, 6C). The
observations suggest the presence of Zfra-activated spleen
cells in blocking cancer growth. Similar experiments were
performed and shown to exhibit the acquired resistance to
breast cancer cells in spleen cell transfer experiments in
nude mice.

Quite frequently, splenomegaly was observed in
tumor-growing mice, and Zfra effectively suppressed the
enlarged spleen by near 100% reduction. When Zfra1–
31 and Zfra4–10 peptides were suspended in PBS, both
peptides exhibited green and red autofluorescence under
fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Figure S4).
However, when suspended in water, both Zfra peptides
failed to exhibit autofluorescence (Supplementary Figure
S4). When Zfra4–10 was delivered to mice via tail veins,
the peptide became trapped predominantly in the spleens
but not in other organs (Figure 6A; Supplementary Figure
S5). Organs, including brain, kidney, liver, lung, small
intestine, skin, and the B16F10 tumors, were negative for
Zfra (Supplementary Figure S5A). No apparent damage to
the liver was shown due to Zfra treatment (Supplementary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3743

When T- and B-cell deficient NOD-SCID mice
were pre-injected with Zfra4–10 (or sterile MilliQ
water) for 3 consecutive weeks, these Zfra-treated mice
did not resist the growth of inoculated B16F10 cells
(Supplementary Figure S6). However, when NOD-SCID
mice received Zfra-treated spleen cells from nude mice,
these mice were able to resist the growth of B16F10
xenografts (Figure 6D).

Next, we explored the nature of Z+ cells. Naïve
mouse spleen cells were isolated and stained with TMRZfra (red) and antibody against membrane Hyal-2 (green)
for confocal microscopy. The results showed the colocalization of both TMR-Zfra and Hyal-2 proteins on the
cell surface (Figure 8G). Synthetic Zfra1–31 and Zfra4–10
are able to interact with cytosolic proteins in a covalent
manner (Lee et al., unpublished). Hyal-2-positive L929
fibroblasts were treated with or without UV, and then
incubated at 37oC for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were then
prepared and mixed with Zfra1–31. The mixtures were
centrifuged, and the precipitates were shown to possess
the complex of exogenous Zfra and endogenous Hyal-2
(Figure 8H). Hyaluronidase Hyal-2 is a known cell surface
protein [19–21]. By FRET (Förster resonance energy
transfer) microscopy [13, 14], we further determined the
binding of transiently overexpressed EGFP-Hyal-2 with
DsRed-Zfra in COS7 fibroblasts (see increased FRETc)
(Figure 8I). No EGFP and DsRed binding was shown in
control cells (Figure 8I).
In similar experiments, spleen cells were isolated
from naïve NOD-SCID mice, followed by stimulating
with or without Zfra4–10 for 16 hr in vitro. Cells
were then sorted using TMR-Zfra and injected to each
recipient naïve nude mouse via tail veins. Growth of
B16F10 cells in these mice revealed that Zfra-activated
Z+ cells were effective in blocking melanoma growth
(Figure 9A). Intriguingly, greater than 80% of spleen
cells in the naïve NOD-SCID mice are TMR-Zfra
positive (Figure 9A), as compared to those in BALB/c
and nude mice (Figures 7 and 8B).
Additionally, 4 naïve nude mice were inoculated
with B1F10 cells on both flanks, then allowed to rest for
one week, and inoculated with Zfra-activated Z+ cells,
as prepared using other naïve nude mice. Again, Zfraactivated Z+ cells were effective in blocking melanoma
growth (Figure 9B).

Isolation of novel Zfra-binding spleen
lymphocytes and their dramatic down-regulation
in tumor-bearing mice
We isolated Zfra-binding spleen cells by cell
sorting. Zfra1–31 was labeled with tetramethylrodamine,
designated TMR-Zfra. TMR-Zfra-positive spleen cells,
tentatively named Z cells, were around 25–29% in the
normal spleen of BALB/c mouse, as determined by cell
sorting (Figure 7A). By using specific antibodies, the
spleen T and B cell populations were also determined,
which were 16 and 26%, respectively (Figure 7A).
Overlaps between T and B or Z cells were 7% or less,
suggesting that the Zfra-binding spleen cells could have a
unique phenotype.
Again, we showed that Zfra4–10 blocked B16F10
growth in BALB/c mice (Figure 7B). These mice were
sacrificed for determining the levels of spleen Z cells.
B16F10-growing BALB/c mice had low levels of Z cells,
which were 3.3% or even lower (Figure 7C). In contrast,
Zfra-treated mice had 26.1% Z cells (Figure 7C), which
is within the normal range in naïve mice. Importantly, Z
cells do not exhibit the specific T and B cell markers, as
determined using fluorescent CD3 and CD19 antibodies,
respectively (Figure 7C). In a similar experiment, Zfra4–
10 was shown to block the growth of neuroblastoma
NB69 cells in nude mice (Supplementary Figure S7). The
isolated spleen Z cell population was around 38.5% in the
Zfra4–10-treated nude mice. The cells are devoid of T
and B cell-specific markers CD27 and CD19, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S7).

DISCUSSION
In summary, highly purified synthetic Zfra tends
to undergo self-polymerization in enzyme-free PBS,
and this correlates with its anticancer activity in vivo
(Figure 10). Both Cys9 and Cys12 are potential amino
acids that are involved in peptide self-polymerization.
Since the ladder-like polymerization pattern is similar
under both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, the
observation suggests that cysteines do not contribute to
the formation of the polymerization pattern and raises the
possibility of other amino acids, which are involved in
the crosslinking (Figure 10). Ser8 is a candidate amino
acid residue. Alteration of Ser8 to Gly8 abolishes the
self-polymerization. Additional data revealed that both
Zfra1–31 and Zfra4–10 undergo self-polymerization in a
covalent manner in the absence of catalytic enzymes (Lee
et al., unpublished).

Identification of Hyal-2+ CD3- CD19- Z cells and
activating Z cells in vitro for suppressing cancer
growth in vivo
We examined the possibility of activating Z cells
in vitro for suppressing cancer growth in vivo. Spleen
cells were isolated from 6 naïve BALB/c mice and then
cultured overnight. These cells were stimulated with
Zfra4–10 peptide (20 μM) for 16 hr, and then stained with
TMR-Zfra for cell sorting. Z+ and Z– cell populations
were counted and injected via tail veins of BALB/c. Post
injection for 2 months, these mice were challenged with
syngeneic breast cancer 4T1-Luc cells. Breast cancer cell
growth was significantly suppressed in mice received with
Z+ cells (Figure 8A–8F).

water or Zfra4–10 (4 mM in sterile water) via tail veins once per week for 3 consecutive weeks, and then inoculated with 2 million cells of
melanoma B16F10 at both flanks of each mouse. Mice were sacrificed on day 40th, and spleens were isolated. Spleen microsections were prepared
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Red autofluorescence was determined by a fluorescence microscope. (B–C) Nude mice were
pretreated with Zfra4–10 (2 mM in 100 μl sterile water) or sterile water only via tail vein injections in 3 consecutive weeks. Spleen cells were
isolated and injected into naïve nude mice (2 millions cells) through tail veins in 2 consecutive days. A week (panel B) or a month later (panel C),
these mice were subcutaneously inoculated with BCC at both flanks. BCC growth was measured daily. (D) Similarly, nude mice were pretreated
with Zfra4–10 (2 mM in 100 μl sterile water) or sterile water only via tail vein injections in 3 consecutive weeks. Spleen cells were isolated and
injected into naïve NOD-SCID mice (2 millions cells) through tail veins in 2 consecutive days. Two weeks later, these mice were subcutaneously
inoculated with melanoma B16F10 cells at both flanks. Tumor growth was measured daily. Spleen cells from Zfra4–10-treated nude mice conferred
resistance to B16F10 growth in NOD-SCID mice. For above experiments, a representative data set is shown from 2 experiments.

Figure 7: Down-regulation of spleen Zfra-binding Z cells in tumor-growing mice. (A) Spleen lymphocytes were isolated from

a 15-week-old BALB/c mouse, and stained using TMR-Zfra and specific fluorescent antibodies against CD3 and CD19 for T and B cells,
respectively. (B–C) BALB/c mice were pretreated with Zfra4–10 (2 mM) and became resistant to the growth of inoculated B16F10 melanoma
cells. By cell sorting, TMR-Zfra-positive Z spleen cells were around 25% in Zfra-treated mice. The isolated Z cells did not exhibit T and B cell
markers, as further staining with CD3 and CD19 antibodies. In B16F10 melanoma-growing BALB/c mice, spleen Z cells dropped down to
3.3% or even lower. In untreated control mice, Z cells are around 25–29%. A representative data set is shown from 2 experiments.

When immune-deficient nude mice and immunecompetent BALB/c mice received the full-length Zfra1–
31 or truncated Zfra4–10 via tail veins, these mice
became resistant to the growth, metastasis and stemness
of melanoma cells and many other malignant cancer
cells (Figure 10). We have shown that Zfra significantly
suppresses the expression of stemness markers Oct-4
and SSEA-4, along with dramatically reduced TIAF1
expression, in the lung of mice inoculated with melanoma
B16F10. In comparison, TIAF1 appears to become fibrous
in the melanoma lesions in the lung of control mice.
Fibrous TIAF1 in the cancer lesions probably supports
cancer progression, although monomeric TIAF1 acts
synergistically with tumor suppressors WWOX and p53 to

block cancer growth [13–15]. Downregulation of WWOX
is known to induce aggregation of TIAF1 and TRAPPC6A
(Trafficking Protein Particle Complex 6A) in the brain
cortical areas of mice and humans [18, 22].
Zfra also cured the spontaneously developed
tumors in the heterozygous Wwox +/– mice. Zfra became
polymerized in the circulation and was mainly deposited
or filtered in the spleen due to its autofluorescence. The
observations suggest that the anticancer function of Zfra is
via spleen cells. Both Zfra1–31 and Zfra4–10 peptides were
freshly prepared in sterile water or PBS. Overly polymerized
Zfra, caused by high concentrations or excessive salt in
vitro, may abolish its anticancer function in vivo (data not
shown). The notion that spontaneous tumor formation in

were sacrificed and spleen cells were isolated. These cells were treated with 20 μM Zfra4–10 for 16 hr. Z+ and Z- cells were isolated by
cell sorting (see F). The isolated cells were then transferred to naïve BALB/c mice. Syngeneic breast cancer 4T1-Luc cells did not grow

(100 μM) were added to the whole lysates of Hyal-2-positive L929 fibroblasts, treated with or without UV. Post incubation at room
temperature for 30 min, the mixtures were subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microfuge for 15 min. The precipitates were
analyzed by Western blotting for the co-presence of exogenous Zfra and endogenous Hyal-2. (I) COS7 fibroblasts were co-transfected with
expression constructs of EGFP-Hyal-2 and DsRed-Zfra. FRET analysis revealed the binding of Hyal-2 with Zfra (see increased FRETc),
whereas EGFP and DsRed failed to interact with each other.

uneducated or naïve Z cells in vivo, thereby ultimately
costing lives. Accordingly, the best strategy to overcome
cancer is to educate or activate autologous Z cells in vitro
for suppressing cancer growth in vivo.
The polymerized Zfra binds membrane Hyal-2 and
this may induce the signaling of Hyal-2, WWOX and Samd4
[18–20 and unpublished]. No apparent internalization of
Zfra is shown in spleen cells in vitro and in vivo. That is,
there is a prolonged retention of Zfra on the cell surface to
instigate and then desensitize the signaling. Since Hyal-2
is a co-receptor with CD44 for hyaluronan [18], we were
able to reproduce the Zfra effect using anti-Hyal-2 IgG and
high affinity hyaluronan for Hyal-2 (Su et al., unpublished).
NOD-SCID mice do not have functional T, B and NK
cells. By cell sorting, we showed that there are greater than
80% of spleen cells, which are TMR-Zfra positive or Z+
in the NOD-SCID mice. The naïve cells, with or without
Zfra stimulation, do not have the anticancer activities upon
transferring to another naïve NOD-SCID mice (data not
shown). However, Zfra induces the anticancer activities of
Z+ cells from NOD-SCID mice in less than 24 hr in vitro,
and these activated Z+ cells become tumor suppressing in
other mouse strains. Indeed, NOD-SCID mice are refractory

WWOX +/– mice needs further investigation, since the wild
type mice tend to spontaneously grow tumors. Our findings
are in contrast to a previous report [23].
We determined for the first time that Zfra-binding
Hyal-2+ CD3- CD19- Z spleen cells are responsive to Zfra
stimulation for mounting against the growth of a broad
spectrum of cancer cells in vivo, suggesting that a therapeutic
approach can be developed using patients’ own Z cells for
cancer treatment. Zfra activates or educates memory Z cells
in vitro from the isolated naïve spleen cells of both immune
deficient and competent mice. Once transfer of these purified
memory Z cells into another naïve mice, an anticancer
memory response is effectively installed. Traditionally,
immune deficient mice are utilized for growing cancer
xenografts, as they fail to elicit an immune response to
run against the cancer growth. Clearly, the Hyal-2+ CD3CD19- Z cell lineage is an effector memory system, which
can be educated for eradicating cancer cells. How these cells
fight against cancer cells is being determined.
The genetic signature of Z cells, which are non-T
and non-B, has yet to be determined. The levels of Z
cells are very low or near 0% in tumor-growing mice,
suggesting that growing tumor cells may eradicate the

Figure 9: Activated Z cells inhibit melanoma growth in vivo. (A) Spleen cells were isolated from 8 naïve non-T and non-B

NOD-SCID mice, then treated with or without 20 μM Zfra4–10 for 24 hr in cell culture, and finally sorted using TMR-Zfra using a cell
sorter. The resulting 4 types of cells, including naïve TMR-Zfra- (NZ-), naïve TMR-Zfra+ (NZ+), Zfra-activated TMR-Zfra- (AZ-), and
Zfra-activated TMR-Zfra+ (AZ+), were injected to each indicated recipient naïve nude mouse via tail veins. One week later, B16F10 cells
were inoculated into both flanks of each mouse. (B) Four naïve nude mice were inoculated with B1F10 cells on both flanks and allowed
to rest for one week. Similar experimental steps were used to isolate and prepare the 4 populations of aforementioned spleen cells from
nude mice. These cells were inoculated onto both flanks of the B16F10-growing nude mice. For both experiments, the sorting profiles for
isolated cell types are shown. The kinetics of B1F10 cell growth on both flanks in mice is shown.

to Zfra induction for the anticancer response. Mechanism of
this regard is being determined.
It is generally believed that antigen-presenting cells
(APC) are needed to present antigens to T cells for clonal
activation [24]. Whether antigen-presenting cells (APC) are
involved in processing polymerized Zfra for presenting to
Z cells is not known and remains to be determined. Z cells do
not appear to be associated with memory NK cells, as these
cells mainly reside in the liver [25, 26]. Zfra is not a cancer
antigen. Indeed, polymerized Zfra may undergo extensive
crosslinks, as shown by mass spectrometry analysis (Lee et
al., unpublished). Whether these neoantigens are similar to
those on cancer cell surface remains to be determined.
The outstanding feature of Zfra is its capability
in strongly suppressing the stemness and metastasis of
cancer cells [27, 28]. As shown using melanoma B16F10
cells, Zfra blocks the expression of Oct4 and SSEA-4 in
these cancer cells in the mouse lung. Zfra did not inhibit
the growth of glioma 13–06-MG cells. However, Zfra
completely blocked the metastasis of 13–06-MG cells to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the lung. Cancer patients frequently die from cancer cell
metastasis. Control of cancer cell metastasis by Zfra is
critical for survival of cancer patients. Whether activated
Z cells are present in the cancer lesions that result in the
suppression of cancer metastasis remains to be established.
Failure of Zfra in the suppression of the growth of
13–06-MG cells is probably due to insufficient amounts of
Zfra used. Indeed, insufficient doses of Zfra may lead to
increased tumor growth. Normally, mice receive 1–4 mM
or 70–500 μg of Zfra (in 100 μl sterile water) via tail vein
injections. The concentrations of Zfra are diluted in vivo and
not toxic to the animals, as Zfra-treated mice can survive for
an entire life span around 2–2.5 years. Direct injection of Zfra
into growing breast MDA-MB-435s cells in nude mice could
result in suppression of cancer cell growth. Zfra also cures
tumors spontaneously developed in Wwox gene heterozygous
mice (70% cure of test mice). In vitro experiments, isolated
spleen cells are treated with 10 or 20 μM of Zfra. Indeed, this
is sufficient in inducing the anticancer response in Z+ spleen
cells once transferred back in vivo.

Taken together, our data thus far have clearly
indicated that Zfra can initiate an effective anticancer
response via the novel Hyal-2+ CD3- CD19- immune cell
lineage. We have successfully blocked the growth of many
malignant cancers in vivo, including melanoma, skin basal
cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, breast adenocarcinoma,
prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and
others. Certain glioblastoma cells are sensitive to Zframediated growth suppression, whereas some are not.
Nonetheless, we have established a feasible approach in
both cancer prevention and treatment. The duration of
anticancer memory response in activated Z cells needs to
be established. Hopefully, the ultimate goal of our study is
to achieve a “one shot strategy” for lifetime immunization
against all types of cancers.
