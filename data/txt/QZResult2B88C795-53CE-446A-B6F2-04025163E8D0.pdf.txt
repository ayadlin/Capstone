ABSTRACT
The regulation of Mcl-1 expression is necessary for the induction of cancer cell
apoptosis by ABTs such as ABT-737, ABT-263 and ABT-199. However, the reduction
in Mcl-1 expression is not sufficient for initiating cell death in hematopoietic cancer
cells with high Bcl-xL expression. Here, we demonstrate that 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
enhanced the effect of ABT-199 to induce cell apoptosis in hematologic malignancies
with up-regulated Bcl-xL expression. Our study revealed that 2-DG could decrease
glucose-dependent and Akt-independent Mcl-1 expression, which is mediated by
the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Moreover,
the combination of 2-DG and ABT-199 triggered c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
phosphorylation and subsequent Bcl-xL degradation, whereas 2-DG and ABT-199
alone had little effect on JNK activation. Therefore, the combination of 2-DG and
ABT-199 initiated cell death through the reduction of Mcl-1 expression and JNK
activation. Our study could provide a clinical theoretical basis for the use of ABT-199
in hematologic malignancies with excessive Bcl-xL expression.

INTRODUCTION

chemoresistance mediated by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL up-regulation
in vitro and in vivo [6, 7]. The doses of these two agents
that can be used clinically are limited by the accompanying
thrombocytopenia, which is caused by the inhibition of
Bcl-xL in platelets [8, 9]. To address this problem, ABT199, a more selective ABT-263 derivative that specifically
binds Bcl-2, was designed [9]. ABT-199 could induce cell
death in Bcl-2-overexpressing hematopoietic cancer cells
[9–12]. However, ABT-199 is not efficient for cancer cells
with excessive Bcl-xL expression [5, 10–13]. Thus, it
is necessary to determine a way to overcome the Bcl-xL
chemoresistance in cancer cells.
In this study, we first revealed that 2-deoxyglucose
(2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, combined with ABT-199
triggered apoptosis in AML, MM and lymphoid cells with
high Bcl-xL expression. We found that ABT-199 or 2-DG
alone could not induce apoptosis in cells with high Bcl-xL
expression. We then determined the molecular mechanism
of apoptosis induced by ABT-199 and 2-DG. Our study
demonstrated that 2-DG treatment initiated glucosedependent and Akt-independent Mcl-1 degradation, which is
regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1

The overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, Mcl-1
or Bcl-2 occurs frequently in cancers, particularly
in hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM), resulting
in defective apoptosis leading to enhanced cell survival
and drug resistance [1, 2]. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins protect against apoptosis by neutralizing the
function of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such
as Bax and Puma and by preventing both the release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent apoptotic
events, such as caspse-3 activation [3]. Bcl-xL upregulation is responsible for ABT-737 resistance in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia [4]. Moreover, the overexpression
of the Bcl-xL protein contributes to tumor cell survival in
lymphoid leukemia that can be treated by ABT-199 [5].
Therefore, abrogating or overcoming the anti-apoptotic
function of Bcl-xL protein may increase chemosensitivity
and reverse chemoresistance in hematopoietic tumor cells.
ABT-263 or ABT-737, BH3 mimetics with a high
affinity for both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are used to overcome the

(mTORC1) pathway. Mcl-1 degradation contributed to
the apoptosis induced by ABT-199 and 2-DG. Moreover,
2-DG and ABT-199 treatment led to JNK activation, which
induced Bcl-xL phosphorylation and degradation in cells.
ABT-199 or 2-DG alone did not trigger JNK activation.
Bcl-xL degradation could promote the cell death induced
by ABT-199 and 2-DG. Thus, the combination of 2-DG
and ABT-199 overcame the Bcl-xL-mediated apoptosis
chemoresistance through two signaling pathways.

revealed that treatment with 2-DG alone or 2-DG with
ABT-199 for different periods of time decreased Mcl-1
expression (Figure 2A). ABT-199 alone could not reduce
Mcl-1 expression. The same results were also observed in
Reh cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). Further experiments
revealed that mTOR and S6K phosphorylation was
decreased after treatment with 2-DG alone or 2-DG and
ABT-199 but not ABT-199 alone (Figure 2B), indicating
that the mTORC1-S6K pathway was restrained. It should
be noted that no obvious change was detected in Akt
phosphorylation after treatment, suggesting that Akt is not
affected by treatment with 2-DG and ABT-199.
To validate whether the inhibition of mTOR
pathway activity is responsible for the reduced Mcl-1
expression and cell death in our study, we first used
rapamycin, an mTOR kinase inhibitor [16], to treat cells.
We found that rapamycin alone and in combination with
ABT-199 could decrease Mcl-1 expression or mTOR and
p62 phosphorylation but that it alone could not cause cell
apoptosis (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 1D).
Meanwhile, rapamycin in combination with ABT-199
obviously induced cell death and enhanced the cell
apoptosis induced by 2-DG and ABT-199 (Figure 2C).
We also used phosphatidic acid (PA), which is an
endogenous activator of the mTOR kinase [16, 17]. PA
treatment efficiently restored Mcl-1 expression in cells
treated with 2-DG and ABT-199 (Figure 2D). However, PA
treatment only partially reduced the cell apoptosis induced
by 2-DG and ABT-199 (Figure 2E). Meanwhile, we found
that rapamycin could block the effect of PA on Mcl-1
expression (Supplementary Figure 1E) and apoptosis
(data not shown). These results have demonstrated that the
mTOR pathway, which is regulated by 2-DG, is involved
in the cell death induced by 2-DG and ABT-199.
To rule out the pro-autophagic effects of the mTOR
pathway, we examined the expression of p62, a protein that
can be degraded by rapamycin during autophagy [18]. As
described in Supplementary Figure 2A, the expression of
p62 was little changed with the treatment of either ABT-199
or 2-DG alone or the combination of the two in cells with
high Bcl-xL expression. Meanwhile, rapamycin alone
or in combination with ABT-199 also had little effect
on p62 expression in cells with high Bcl-xL expression
(Supplementary Figure 2B). IM-9 cells were used as a
control. We then reduced the p62 expression by transfecting
the cells with p62-specific siRNA (Supplementary
Figure 2C). We found that p62 siRNA could not affect the
cell apoptosis induced by ABT-199 combined with either
2-DG or rapamycin (Supplementary Figure 2D). These
results indicated that the mTOR pathway could not cause
autophagy in cells with Bcl-xL overexpression.
We then determined whether glucose was involved
in Mcl-1 expression, as a previous study revealed that the
2-DG-mediated mTOR pathway is dependent on glucose
metabolism [14]. Glucose deprivation led to decreased
Mcl-1 expression and mTOR and S6K phosphorylation,

RESULTS
Combination treatment of 2-DG and ABT-199
induces apoptosis in hematopoietic cancer cells
with high Bcl-xL expression
We first determined the apoptotic effects of ABT-199
in MM (IM-9) and AML cell lines (HL-60). We treated
the cells with ABT-199 for the indicated time periods,
and apoptosis was assessed by a DNA fragmentation
ELISA assay. As depicted in Figure 1A and 1B, ABT-199
efficiently induced cell death in IM-9 and HL-60 cells. We
then detected the effect of ABT-199 on cells with Bcl-2
or Bcl-xL overexpression. Immunoblotting experiments
confirmed the expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in stably
transfected cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 1A).
ABT-199 still induced apoptosis in cells with high levels
of exogenous Bcl-2 protein, but not in cells with high
expression of exogenous Bcl-xL (Figure 1C and 1D), as
described before [10].
To better detect the apoptotic effect of 2-DG and
ABT-199, we used OCL-LY-19 (low endogenous Bcl-xL
expression) and Reh (high endogenous Bcl-xL expression)
lymphoid cells [5] (Supplementary Figure 1B). ABT-199
could induce apoptosis in OCL-LY-19 but not Reh cells
(Figure 1E), as described before [5]. 2-DG obviously enhanced
the apoptosis induced by ABT-199 in Reh cells (Figure 1F).
Flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V/PI
staining revealed that the combination of 2-DG and
ABT-199 efficiently induced apoptosis in cells with upregulated Bcl-xL expression, although 2-DG and ABT-199
alone had little effect on cell death (Figure 1G). Further
immunoblotting experiments also showed that caspase-3
was activated upon treatment with 2-DG and ABT-199
(Figure 1H). These results indicate that 2-DG combined
with ABT-199 could cause apoptosis in hematopoietic
cancer cells with high-level expression of Bcl-xL.

2-DG-mediated Mcl-1 degradation partially
contributed to apoptosis by 2-DG and ABT-199
in cells with high Bcl-xL expression
Because Mcl-1 expression contributes to 2-DGinduced cell death [14, 15], we speculated that the
regulation of Mcl-1 expression could mediate the cell
death induced by 2-DG and ABT-199. Our experiments

whereas 100 nM glucose restored Mcl-1 expression and
mTOR and S6K phosphorylation in cells (Figure 2F).
These results revealed that 2-DG-mediated glucose
deprivation indeed regulated the mTOR pathway and Mcl-1
expression. However, glucose deprivation alone could
not induce cell apoptosis. Moreover, glucose deprivation
with ABT-199 induced a small amount of apoptosis (data
not shown). These results indicate that 2-DG-induced
glycolysis–dependent mTOR signaling is only one
pathway that mediates apoptosis and that there are other
pathways involved in apoptosis in cells with high-level
expression of Bcl-xL.

not affected by the Bcl-xL mutant after treatment, further
indicating that JNK is the upstream kinase regulating the
function of Bcl-xL in cells.
We then detected whether the JNK-Bcl-xL pathway
contributed to cell apoptosis. Our data revealed that
2-DG and ABT-199 induced obvious caspase-3 cleavage
in cells with Bcl-xL WT expression, whereas caspase-3
cleavage was not visible in cells with Bcl-xL S62A
mutant expression (Figure 3C). Moreover, SP600125 also
decreased caspase-3 activity after 2-DG and ABT-199
treatment (Figure 3D). These results indicated that JNKmediated Bcl-xL phosphorylation and degradation is
required for cell apoptosis. However, it is worth noting
that neither SP600125 treatment nor the Bcl-xL mutant
could completely inhibit apoptosis, suggesting that the
JNK-Bcl-xL pathway is not the only signal pathway
regulating cell apoptosis in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells.

JNK-mediated Bcl-xL phosphorylation and
degradation is important for apoptosis in cells
with high-level expression of Bcl-xL
Previous studies have demonstrated that JNK is a
stress-activated protein kinase that is activated in response
to ER stress [19, 20], which could be regulated by 2-DG
[21]. Moreover, ABT-199 has been reported to induce
the rapid phosphorylation of JNK kinase in follicular
lymphoma cells. The inhibition of JNK activation further
augmented the apoptosis induced by ABT-199 [22, 23].
These results indicate that JNK is a target of 2-DG or
ABT-199. We then determined whether JNK contributed to
cell apoptosis in our study. We assayed the status of JNK
activation by western blot analysis. JNK phosphorylation
was visible starting at 6 h of treatment with 2-DG and
ABT-199 and peaked at 12 h of treatment (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure 3A). 2-DG or ABT-199 alone had
little effect on JNK activation in cells with up-regulated
Bcl-xL expression.
A western blot assay also revealed that Bcl-xL
phosphorylation, concomitant with the activation of
JNK, was suggestive of a causative role of this kinase
(Figure 3A). It should be noted that Bcl-xL expression
was decreased (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 1C),
suggesting that phosphorylated Bcl-xL is a target for
protease degradation, as indicated by previous studies
[24, 25]. Indeed, our experiments showed that MG 132,
a widely distributed protease inhibitor, efficiently restored
Bcl-xL expression (Supplementary Figure 3B). Further
experiments found that a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, or
JNK1-specific siRNA almost completely prevented
the phosphorylation and degradation of Bcl-xL, thus
suggesting a role for JNK in Bcl-xL phosphorylation and
degradation (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 3C and 3D).
Ser 62 is major phosphorylation site of Bcl-xL [26].
The mutation of Ser 62 prevents Bcl-xL phosphorylation.
We constructed a Bcl-xL mutant in which Ser 62 was
changed to Ala (S62A) (Supplementary Figure 4A)
and transfected this mutant into cells. As depicted in
Figure 3C, the Bcl-xL S62A mutant decreased Bcl-xL
phosphorylation and degradation compared with the wildtype Bcl-xL (WT). Meanwhile, JNK phosphorylation was

Mcl-1 expression and JNK activation
cooperatively induce cell apoptosis in cells with
high Bcl-xL expression
We then tested whether Mcl-1 expression and JNK
activation cooperatively mediated cell death. PA and
SP600125 efficiently inhibited caspase-3 cleavage after
2-DG and ABT-199 treatment (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, PA
and SP600125 co-treatment greatly reduced the apoptosis
of the cells (Figure 4B). PA affected Mcl-1 expression but
not Bcl-xL phosphorylation and degradation after 2-DG
and ABT-199 treatment, whereas the effect of SP600125
was just the opposite of PA treatment. Moreover,
glucose deprivation and mTOR inhibition, which affect
Mcl-1 expression, had no effect on Bcl-xL expression
(Supplementary Figure 4B). These results demonstrated
that Mcl-1 expression and JNK activation triggered
apoptosis in cells with up-regulated Bcl-xL expression.

DISCUSSION
Glucose metabolism is important for tumorigenesis
and cancer chemoresistance [27–29]. 2-DG, a glycolytic
inhibitor, has been reported to enhance ABT-737/263induced cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo [14, 15, 30].
Moreover, the synergistic effect of 2-DG with ABT-737
or ABT-263 has been reported to be more effective than
single drug treatment at promoting the survival of animals
transplanted with lymphoma or prostate cancer [31]. In
clinical trials, the combination of 2-DG and ABT-737 has
the potential to be used in treating ABT-737 resistance [30].
Previous studies have shown that 2-DG could also enhance
the cell death effect of ABT-199 on MM cells [32, 33].
However, the detailed mechanism is still unknown.
In this study, we first provide evidence that the
combination of 2-DG and ABT-199 induces apoptosis in
cells with up-regulated Bcl-xL expression. Since ABT-199
is a potential agent for hematologic malignancies, it is

necessary to expand the range of its treatment. However,
ABT-199 has little effect on Bcl-xL-overexpressing cancer
cells [10, 11]. We attempted to use 2-DG and ABT-199 for
the treatment of cancer cells with Bcl-xL overexpression.
Surprisingly, we found that the combination of 2-DG and
ABT-199 could induce cell apoptosis. Previous studies
have proposed two mechanisms explaining the effect of
2-DG on ABT-263/737-induced apoptosis. In the first
mechanism, 2-DG decreases Mcl-1 levels indirectly by

inhibiting glycolysis, leading to the activation of AMPactivated protein kinases, such as mTORC1, and the
inhibition of Mcl-1 synthesis [14, 34]. In the second
mechanism, 2-DG weakens the interaction between Bak
and Mcl-1, which increases the ability of ABT-263/737
to release Bak from the Mcl-1/Bcl-xL/Bak heterotrimer,
thus inducing apoptosis [30, 35]. In fact, the reduction of
Mcl-1 expression definitely weakens the link between proand anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Noxa/

Mcl-1 [36] and Bim/Mcl-1 [14], resulting in the release of
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, previous studies
also revealed that either Noxa or Bim was activated,
accompanied by a reduction in Mcl-1 expression, after
treatment with 2-DG alone or the combination of 2-DG
and other agents, such as ABT-737 [14, 36]. Yamaguchi
and his colleagues revealed that the combination of 2-DG
and ABT-737/263 could not decrease Mcl-1 expression
but could initiate Bid activation, priming cells for
ABT737/263-induced apoptosis [35]. Together, these
results indicate that Mcl-1 is a central molecule for the
cell apoptosis induced by the combination of 2-DG and
ABT-737/263.
Our data also revealed that 2-DG reduced glucosedependent Mcl-1 expression, consistent with a previous
study [14]. Moreover, the reduction in Mcl-1 expression
contributes to cell apoptosis. In contrast to previous results
[14, 36], we did not observe obvious changes in the
expression of Noxa or Bim in our study (Supplementary
Figures 1C and 4C). Our findings also revealed that Bid
was activated, consistent with the data from Yamaguchi
and his colleagues [35]. However, Bid depletion had little
effect on the apoptosis induced by 2-DG and ABT-199
(data not shown). Moreover, our experiments revealed
that the depletion of Mcl-1 with siRNA (Supplementary
Figure 5A) only partially enhanced the apoptotic effect
of ABT-199 (Supplementary Figure 5B and 5C), whereas
2-DG obviously increased cell apoptosis. These results
indicate that Mcl-1 signaling is not the sole key pathway
for the induction of apoptosis by 2-DG and ABT-199.
Yamaguchi and his colleagues revealed that the
combination of 2-DG and ABT737/263 could induce
apoptosis in cells with ABT737/263 resistance. They
used HeLa cells as an initial ABT-737/263-resistant cell
model. We used Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells. In fact,
HeLa cells express a relatively small amount of Bcl-xL
[37] (Supplementary Figure 1B). Our and other group’s
report [5] has revealed that high Bcl-xL expression in
hematopoietic cells inhibited the apoptotic effect of
ABT-199. A previous study also confirmed that Bcl-xL
expression in acquired ABT-199-resistant lymphoid cell
lines was higher than that in ABT-199-sensitive cells [5].
However, the Bcl-xL expression in acquired ABT-737resistant lymphoid cell lines was very low [37]. These
results reveal that the levels of Bcl-xL expression are
important for ABT-199 resistance in hematopoietic cells
but not for ABT-737/263 resistance. Therefore, we need
to not only regulate Mcl-1 but also Bcl-xL expression in
hematopoietic cells to overcome ABT-199 resistance.
Our experiments revealed that the combination of
2-DG and ABT-199 also initiated another pathway to
induce apoptosis. The second pathway is JNK-mediated
Bcl-xL phosphorylation and degradation, which leads to
the further release of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. As
described before [10, 36], 2-DG or ABT-199 alone could
not affect Bcl-xL expression in cancer cells. However, our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

data showed that the combination of 2-DG and ABT-199
could trigger JNK-dependent Bcl-xL degradation and
cell death. 2-DG or ABT-199 alone also had little effect
on JNK activation, although ABT-199 could induce JNK
activation in hematopoietic cancer cells [22, 23]. We
speculate that the overexpression of Bcl-xL raises the
threshold for JNK activation and cell death. As shown
in previous studies, neither 2-DG treatment to inhibit
glycolysis nor ABT-737 treatment alone was sufficient
to cause cell death in ABT-737-resistant cell lines. A
combination of ABT-737 and 2-DG caused significant cell
death in resistant cells [14]. Thus, simple agents (ABTs or
2-DG) could reach the threshold of apoptosis in resistant
cancer cells. Of course, this requires that we continue
making great efforts and study further mechanisms of JNK
activation. After all, an elevated phosphorylation level of
Bcl-2 has been observed following ABT-199 treatment,
which could be regulated by JNK activation [38, 39].
A previous study also revealed that activated Akt
contributed to ABT-199 resistance in hematopoietic cells
[5]. However, our data demonstrated that Akt was not
activated after treatment with either 2-DG or ABT-199
alone or the combination treatment. Rapamycin
could induce Akt dephosphorylation (Supplementary
Figure 6), which leads to Akt inactivation. However,
rapamycin alone could not induce cell death in Bcl-xLoverexpressing cells. Thus, although Akt is important
for Mcl-1 expression, Akt is not required for regulating
the mTORC1 pathway, as previously reported [14].
2-DG could decrease intracellular ATP levels, which act
directly on the mTOR pathway [40]. Meanwhile, we
exclude the effect of autophagy by the mTOR pathway
on apoptosis. Rapamycin could decrease p62 expression
during autophagy and cause autophagy [18]. However, we
observed little change in p62 expression in cells with high
Bcl-xL expression after treatment with rapamycin alone
or in combination with ABT-199, although rapamycin
reduced p62 expression in IM-9 cells. These findings are in
agreement with a previous study demonstrating that Bcl-xL
expression enhanced the connection between Bcl-xL and
Beclin-1, resulting in the inhibition of autophagy [41].
Moreover, our and previous findings [15, 35] revealed that
2-DG enhanced the apoptotic effect of ABTs through Bcl-2
family proteins, which mediate the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway. Thus, an extrinsic apoptotic pathway such as
caspase-8 may not be necessary for our observed results,
although p62 could contribute to an extrinsic apoptotic
pathway through regulating caspase-8 activity [42].
In summary, we first report that 2-DG and ABT-199
could induce cell apoptosis in hematopoietic cancer
cells with Bcl-xL overexpression. Moreover, we present
evidence to show that in addition to the traditional Mcl-1
pathway, the JNK pathway is also activated after 2-DG and
ABT-199 treatment. These two signal pathways overcome
Bcl-xL chemoresistance to initiate cell apoptosis. Our
findings suggest a novel mechanism that modulates the

hematopoietic malignancies.

by washing 3× with PBS and culture in glucose-free
RPMI-1640 media (Sigma) with 10% dialyzed FBS
(Gemini BioProducts).
For transfection, cells were seeded on 6-well plates
and then transfected with the appropriate siRNA or
plasmids using the manufacturer’s protocols. Typically,
cells were seeded on coverslips in the 6-well plates,
and then 100 nM siRNA and 4 μl of DMRIE-C reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used per coverslip.
The cells were incubated for 4 h in the transfection
mixture, which was then replaced with fresh culture
medium. For getting the IM-9-Bcl-2, IM-9-Bcl-xL, HL60-Bcl-2 and HL-60-Bcl-xL cells, IM-9 and HL-60 cells
were stably transfected with pcDNA 3.1-Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
2-DG, PA, SP600125, glucose, rapamycin, the
proteasome inhibitor MG132, Annexin V and PI were
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). ABT-199 was
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). myc (clone
9E10, M4439) and actin (clone AC-74, A5316) antibodies
were also from Sigma. phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (clone
587F11, #4051), Akt (#9272), phosphor-mTOR (Ser2448)
(#5536), mTOR (#2972), phosphor-p70S6K (Thr389))
(#9234), p70S6K (#9202), phospho-JNK (Thr 183/Tyr
185) (#9251), JNK (#9252), caspase-3 (clone 8G10,
#9665), and Mcl-1 (#4572) antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Bcl-2 (sc-7382), Bcl-xL
(sc-8392), phosphor-Bcl-xL (Ser 62) (sc-101644), BimEL
(sc-27982), p62(sc-55603), Noxa (sc-56169) and Bid (sc56025) antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).

Apoptosis assays
Three methods were used to assess apoptotic cell
death: detection of DNA fragmentation with the Cell
Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics), Western
blot analysis of caspase-3 cleavage and measurement
of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry (Annexin/PI [45]
or activated caspase-3). The Cell Death Detection
ELISA quantified the apoptotic cells by detecting the
histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells [3, 46].

Plasmids and gene silencing with small
interfering RNAs

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting

pEF MYC(hs) Bcl-2 puro [43] are a gift from David
C.S. Huang (Walter And Eliza Hall Institute For Medical
Research, Victoria, Australia) and pCDNA3.1-Bcl-xL
[44], which is a gift from Richard J Youle (Biochemistry
Section, Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). These constructs were
subcloned into into the pcDNA 3.1/myc-His A vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to product the Bcl-2-myc
or Bcl-xL-myc constructs. Bcl-xL (S62A) was generated
by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu-ultra poly-merase
(Stratagen, La Jolla, CA, USA) followed by DpnI
digestion (Fermentas Inc., Glen Burnie, MD, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human
Mcl-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA; sc-35877), p62
(siRNA; sc-35232) or JNK1 (sc-29380), which consists
of a pool of three target-specific 19 to 25 nt siRNA and
the nonsilencing control siRNA (sc-37007) was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as
described before [47]. Briefly, the cells or the membrane
fractions were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing
Nonidet P-40 (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA,
0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO4, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
50  μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and
leupeptin) and were placed on ice for 30 min. The lysates
were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 12 min at 4°C, and the
protein concentration was measured. Equivalent samples
(30 or 50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE
on 12% gels. The proteins were then transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the indicated
antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL,
Gaithersburg, MD). Immunoreactive bands were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The
molecular sizes of the proteins detected were determined by
comparison with prestained protein markers (Invitrogen).

Cell culture and transfection

Statistical analysis

IM-9 and HL-60 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
Cells were cultured with RPMI-1640 media (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
Logan, UT, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37°C
under 5% CO2 FBS. Glucose starvation was accomplished
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
software (version 17.0 for Windows). Results are presented
as mean ± S.D. Analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer
multiple-comparison test were used in comparisons.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
