BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the gene that encodes the p110a catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), PIK3CA, are the most common mutations in endometrial carcinoma (EC). Loss of PTEN or activation of PIK3CA results in constitutive activation of AKT, which leads to upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Everolimus is an oral rapamycin analog that acts by selectively
inhibiting mTOR. METHODS: A single-institution, open-labeled, phase 2 study of everolimus in patients with measurable recurrent EC who had failed at least 1 and no more than 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimens was performed. Everolimus was administered at a dose of 10 mg orally daily for 28-day cycles. Patients were treated until disease
progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit response (CBR), defined as a confirmed complete
or partial response or prolonged stable disease (SD) (8 weeks). Inclusion was limited to patients with endometrioid
histology. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were enrolled (median age, 58 years; range, 38-81 years). A total of 81 cycles
were administered. Twelve of 28 (43%) evaluable patients had not developed disease progression at the time of the first
objective evaluation (8 weeks). All these patients had SD (median, 4.5 cycles; range, 2-10 cycles). Six of the 28 (21%)
patients had a confirmed CBR at 20 weeks of therapy. Patients with CBR discontinued treatment because of toxicity (6
patients), disease progression (5 patients), and noncompliance (1 patient). Seven patients were unevaluable after receiving 1 cycle because of toxicity (5 patients) or noncompliance (2 patients). The most common drug-related toxicities
were fatigue, anemia, pain, lymphopenia, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus demonstrated encouraging singleagent CBR in pretreated patients with recurrent endometrioid EC. Future studies will evaluate this agent in combinaC 2010 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: endometrial carcinoma, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, clinical trial, phosphatase

In the United States, endometrial cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic malignancy. Although the
majority of women with incident cases will be cured with surgery alone or surgery in combination with adjuvant therapy,
>8000 women die annually, predominately as a result of acquired resistance to conventional therapy. This observation
has fueled intense investigation into alternative strategies, particularly those able to leverage an increasing knowledge of
the molecular regulation of metastasis as well as the proliferation and survival of tumor cells.
One such axis with broad appeal in many solid tumors, including endometrial cancer, is the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Components of this pathway and its regulators are frequently constitutively activated or mutated,
promoting carcinogenesis. For example, phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN) (which is located on chromosome 10),

a tumor suppressor gene regulating activation of Akt from
PI3K, is absent or inactivated by mutation in 40% to 80%
of endometrial cancers and PIK3CA, the gene that encodes
the p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K, can undergo gain-offunction mutation in 39% of endometrial cancers.1-4
Downstream effects include hyperactivation of Akt5 and,
in turn, its downstream effector proteins including the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR acts as
a sensor that integrates extracellular and intracellular
events, coordinating growth and proliferation. mTOR is
an intracellular protein kinase implicated in cell cycle control and specifically in the progression of cells from the G1
to S-phase.
Rapamycin and its derivatives inhibit the function
of mTOR. Preclinical studies have revealed that mTOR
inhibitors potently arrest the growth of cells derived from
rhabdomyosarcoma; neuroblastoma; glioblastoma; small
cell lung cancer; osteosarcoma; pancreatic, breast, and
prostate cancers; melanoma; leukemia; and lymphoma.6
In endometrial cancer cell lines, rapamycin demonstrated a growth inhibitory effect through induction of cell
cycle arrest,7 and rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation of
downstream targets of mTOR (S6 kinase [S6K] and 4Ebinding protein 1 [4E-BP1]). In PTEN heterozygote animal models, mTOR inhibition reportedly ydecreases the
development and progression of endometrial hyperplastic
lesions.8,9 These effects are primarily the result of decreased
cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis.
The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the
benefit of everolimus (Afinitor; Novartis Pharma, Basel,
Switzerland) in the treatment of women with previously
treated endometrial cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical benefit response (CBR), defined as a
confirmed complete or partial response or prolonged stable disease (SD) (8 weeks) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study was a phase 2, open-labeled trial conducted at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Everolimus was kindly provided by Novartis
Pharma. This study is registered on the clinical trial Web
site of the National Cancer Institute (available at: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00087685). Institutional Review Board
approval was obtained.
Patient Population
Patients with progressive or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who had received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapeutic regi-

5416

mens were entered into this investigator-initiated phase 2
trial. Eligible patients were required to have histologically
confirmed endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Patients
with serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, sarcoma, or other
histologic subtypes were excluded. Patients were required to
have a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2 and no history
of an invasive malignancy other than endometrial cancer
within a 5-year period before trial entry. Patients were
required to have measurable disease (defined as lesions
measuring 2 cm in at least 1 dimension when evaluated
by physical examination or conventional radiographic imaging, or measuring 1 cm in at least 1 dimension when evaluated by spiral computed tomography [CT]). Ascites and
pleural effusions were not considered measurable disease.
No prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor was
permitted, nor was concomitant anticancer treatment.
Patients with active infections were excluded. Pretreatment
hematologic, renal, and hepatic function tests were required
to be grade 0 or 1 according to Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 3.0).
Pretreatment evaluation included a physical examination; assessment of Zubrod performance status; measurement of index lesion(s) for response assessment clinically or
via CT scan, chest x-ray, or magnetic resonance imaging;
and hematologic and biochemical blood tests. Other testing
was performed at the discretion of the treating physician.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
before trial entry.
Treatment Plan and Response Evaluation
All patients were treated on an outpatient basis and were
treated until disease progression, dose-limiting toxicity, or
confirmed complete clinical response. All patients had
treatment initiated with an oral dose of 10 mg daily. One
dose reduction was allowed for grade 2 hematologic or
nonhematologic toxicity. One cycle of therapy was considered 4 weeks.
Records of study medication used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits were kept during the
study. Drug accountability was monitored by the study
coordinator during the study and at the completion of the
trial.
The primary efficacy endpoint was CBR, defined as
a complete or partial response or prolonged SD (8
weeks) by RECIST criteria. Response was defined according to RECIST criteria (version 1.0). Follow-up imaging
for all patients not demonstrating progressive disease at
the time of the initial clinical evaluation (8 weeks) was
performed every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients were

Patients
A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the trial between
January 2004 and December 2007. The median patient
age was 58 years (range, 38-81 years). Study subjects
received a total of 81 cycles of therapy. The median time
since prior chemotherapy was 3 months (range, 2-19
months). All 35 women were evaluable for toxicity; 28
were evaluable for response. Seven patients were unevaluable after receiving 1 cycle because of toxicity (5
patients) or noncompliance (2 patients). Baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients are listed in Table 1.

evaluated sooner if they demonstrated obvious disease
progression by physical examination, clinical deterioration, or new symptomatology suggestive of clinical disease
progression. We confirmed the previous best response to
therapy using these subsequent imaging studies. As long
as the tumor was stable or had decreased in size and the
patient was clinically stable, treatment would continue. A
secondary endpoint was to determine the nature and
degree of toxicity of everolimus in this cohort of patients.
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). A grade 2 toxicity required treatment to be withheld until recovery to a
toxicity of at least grade 1. Response duration was measured from the time measurement criteria were first evaluated until disease progression.
Statistical Analysis
This study incorporated a Bayesian design with multiple
early stopping points. The target CBR rate was 20%.
CBR was evaluated as patients were accrued, and the trial
was to be stopped if there was evidence that the target
CBR rate could not be met; that is, given the outcomes of
the patients who had already been evaluated, if we determined that there was a <10% chance that the CBR rate
was 20%, the trial would have been stopped.

Efficacy
Of the 28 evaluable patients, 12 (43%) had not demonstrated disease progression at the time of the first evaluation
assessment. There were no complete or partial responses
noted. The median duration of SD was 4.5 months (range,
2-10 months). Patients with SD discontinued treatment
because of toxicity (6 patients), disease progression (5
patients), and noncompliance (1 patient). The confirmed
CBR rate (imaging at 20 weeks of treatment) was 21% (6
of 28 patients). Of these 6 patients, 3 had treatment discontinued because of progressive disease, 2 patients developed
treatment-related pulmonary toxicity, and 1 patient developed recurrent grade 3 neutropenia.
Safety
The safety population of 35 patients included all patients
who received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Seventeen
patients (49%) required a dose reduction to 5 mg daily
because of stomatitis (10 patients); hyperglycemia (3
patients); or thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia,
rash, and fever (1 patient each). The most common
adverse events considered possibly, probably, or definitely
related to everolimus were fatigue, anemia, pain, lymphopenia, and nausea (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current phase 2 study of everolimus for
the treatment of patients with recurrent or persistent endometrioid endometrial cancer demonstrated a relatively high
rate of SD with monotherapy using this oral agent.
Oza et al from the National Cancer Institute of
Canada evaluated CCI-779 (temsirolimus; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Madison, NJ) in patients with untreated (as

cancer.10 Temsirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor available

in an intravenous formulation. In the study by Oza et al,
there was a 25% partial response rate (median, 5.1
months) and a 57% SD rate (median, 8.7 months). There
was no correlation noted between biologic markers
(including PTEN) and response. Their population
included patients with serous and clear cell histologies in
addition to the endometrioid histology. At the 2008
American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting,
the same group presented data obtained in pretreated
patients, similar to the population in the current study.
Two patients, or 7%, achieved a partial response and 44%
had SD for a median of 3.5 months.11
Another mTOR inhibitor, deforolimus (AP23573),
was also studied in a multisite trial of 45 patients with
recurrent endometrial cancer by Colombo et al. These
investigators found a 7% partial response rate and a 26%
SD rate. In the majority of the responders, the duration of

5418

response was <4 months.12 See Table 3 for a summary of
these data.10-12
In the current study, patients with histologic subtypes other than endometrioid were excluded. The
rational for these criteria were based on the presence of
PTEN mutations primarily in the endometrioid tumors.
To the best of our knowledge, the other studies of mTOR
inhibition in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer
included all histologic subtypes and clinical benefit has
been demonstrated in patients with these other types.10,11
We currently are conducting further translational studies
in our group of patients to determine whether PTEN
mutational status is predictive of response. Future studies
of mTOR inhibition will likely not exclude patients with
endometrial cancers based on histology.
The safety profile of everolimus was acceptable in the
context of heavily pretreated patients with endometrial cancer. When the trial was initiated, the administration of
lipid-lowering drugs for patients who developed grade 2
hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia was not
allowed. Since the initiation of this trial, mTOR inhibition
has been associated more strongly with these abnormalities.
In the current study, approximately 17% of patients had
elevated cholesterol and 14% had elevated triglycerides.
Three patients with SD were removed because of these
abnormalities. Future studies of everolimus should include
a treatment modification to add a statin therapy in the setting of grade 2 lipid abnormalities. Two patients with SD
experienced pulmonary toxicity requiring withdrawal from
the study. Both of these patients were receiving therapy for
a prolonged period of time (6 months and 10 months,
respectively). After discontinuation of treatment, toxicities
resolved spontaneously. This pulmonary-related toxicity
needs to be evaluated further in patients receiving prolonged mTOR inhibitor therapy.
Although the findings of the current study are
encouraging and suggest activity similar to that found in
the evaluation of other mTOR inhibitors, further investigation is needed to evaluate the role of mTOR inhibition
in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Potential benefits
of everolimus are its oral bioavailability and relatively
favorable toxicity profile. In addition, although combination therapy may be a more attractive (and effective) alternative, it is unclear which type of therapy (ie, hormonal,
cytotoxic, or radiation) should be combined with everolimus or other mTOR inhibitors.
The Gynecologic Oncology Group is initiating a
phase 2 trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with temsirolimus as first-line therapy in patients

with untreated recurrent or progressive endometrial cancer. The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center initiated a phase 2 trial of everolimus in combination with letrozole for the treatment of patients with previously treated recurrent or progressive endometrial
cancer. This combination has been evaluated as part of a
neoadjuvant breast cancer trial.13 In that trial, everolimus was found to significantly increase the efficacy of
letrozole in patients with estrogen receptor-positive
breast cancer. The frequent expression of hormonal
receptors in endometrial cancer, particularly in lower
grade lesions, suggests a similar strategy may be relevant
in this disease.
The statistical design of the current study incorporated SD at 8 weeks as minimal criteria for meeting CBR.
All 12 patients who were considered to have SD underwent a radiological assessment at no earlier than 8 weeks.
To confirm this single-agent activity, patients were reassessed after an additional 3 cycles (12 weeks) of therapy.
Greater than 20% of patients in this cohort who were
heavily pretreated demonstrated a confirmed CBR after
20 weeks of treatment.
In conclusion, mTOR inhibition with the oral agent
everolimus in patients with recurrent endometrioid endometrial carcinoma appears to demonstrate clinical benefit.
Although achieving disease remission while receiving single-agent therapy appears unlikely, limiting disease
growth by interrupting this key biologic pathway is a reasonable approach for disease control. We currently have
trials underway that will evaluate the role of combination
therapy with aromatase inhibition as well as with cytotoxic therapy.
