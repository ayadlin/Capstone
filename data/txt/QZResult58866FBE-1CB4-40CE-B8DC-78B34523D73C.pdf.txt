Abstract

Author Manuscript

B-cell tumorigenesis results from a host of known and unknown genetic anomalies, including nonrandom translocations of genes that normally function as determinants of cell proliferation or cell
survival to regions juxtaposed to active immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer elements,
chromosomal aneuploidy, somatic mutations that further affect oncogenic signaling and loss of
heterozygosity of tumor-suppressor genes. However, it is critical to recognize that even in the
setting of a genetic disease, the B-cell/plasma cell tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes
significantly to malignant transformation and pathogenesis. Over a decade ago, we proposed the
concept of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance to delineate a form of TME-mediated drug
resistance that protects hematopoietic tumor cells from the initial effect of diverse therapies. In the
interim, it has been increasingly appreciated that TME also contributes to tumor initiation and
progression through sustained growth/proliferation, self-renewal capacity, immune evasion,
migration and invasion as well as resistance to cell death in a host of B-cell malignancies,
including mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstroms
macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Within this review, we
propose that TME and the tumor co-evolve as a consequence of bidirectional signaling networks.
As such, TME represents an important target and should be considered integral to tumor
progression and drug response.

demonstrate that dynamic interactions between the B cells and its tumor microenvironment
(TME) profoundly influence the behavior of the other. Over a decade ago, we proposed the
concept of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance to delineate a form of TME-mediated
drug resistance that protects B-cell malignancies and other hematopoietic tumor cells from
the initial effect of diverse therapies.2,3 Since then, numerous groups have affirmed these
findings and demonstrated that the effects of TME on drug response are multifactorial—
involving cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and malignant B-cell interactions with
other constituents of TME, including, but not limited to, stromal cells.4–6 Thus, the term
Environmental-Mediated Drug Resistance (EMDR) has been used as a more encompassing
term to describe the multiple aspects contributing to the influence of TME on drug response
and resistance (in addition to cellular adhesion).7 As such, we and the others hypothesized
that although the majority tumor cells succumb to therapy, a subset of malignant cells are
afforded sanctuary within TME. Within these sanctuaries, malignant cells survive the
stresses of therapy resulting in minimal residual disease. Over time, genetic instability
inherent in cancer cells combined with the strong selective pressure of therapy (and TME)
leads to successive changes that cause the development of more complex, diverse and
permanent acquired-resistance phenotypes. These persistent tumor cells eventually cause
disease recurrence and are much less likely to respond to subsequent therapy after acquired
resistance develops (Figure 1).5,7 It has been increasingly appreciated that in addition to
drug resistance these effectors of TME also contribute to tumor initiation, growth and
progression in B-cell malignancies.8 As such, this hypothesis can be amended to include not
only therapeutic selective pressures but also those required for malignant transformation.
Thus TME affords resident clonal B cells a selective advantage contributing to the
expansion of a malignant clone. Within this sanctuary, under chronic selective pressures,
additional transformative genetic alterations are acquired contributing to lymphomagenesis
and myelomagenesis.7,9,10 Therefore TME represents a critical target for therapeutic
intervention and, in our opinion, should also be considered as important to tumor
progression and drug response as the tumor itself.

Mature B-cell malignancies have been proposed to originate from B cells at different stages
of B-cell development, primarily derived from antigen-experienced germinal center or
postgerminal center B cells.9,11,12 Furthermore, the DNA repair/remodeling machinery that
facilitates the great diversity of the antibody repitoires has also been shown to drive aberrant
chromosomal translocations and other molecular anomalies.1,11 In turn, a sequence of
genetic alterations within a malignant clone facilitates an escape from the constraints
governing proliferation and death. The initial requirements are at least partially fulfilled by
the non-random translocation of a gene(s) that normally function (s) as determinants of cell
proliferation or cell survival to regions juxtaposed to active immunoglobulin heavy chain/
immunoglobulin light chain enhancer elements that occur secondary to errors of Ig switch
recombination.6,11,13 These, with additional genetic and epigenetic anomalies, lead to
constitutive activation of oncogenes, deletion and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes
providing critical tumor hallmarks leading to malignant transformation.6,11,13–15
However, even in the context of molecular-derived transformative lesions, malignant B cells
do not act in isolation. These cells subsist in a rich microenvironment composed of resident
fibroblast-like cells, endothelial cells, immune cells and extracellular matrix. TME has the

ability to support lymphoma development and progression by fostering key hallmarks of
malignancy: resistance to cell death, cell homing and invasion, sustained proliferation,
immunosuppression, self-renewal and stemness as well as angiogenesis (Figure 2). It is also
important to recognize that malignant B cells are not only simply receiving signals but also
have an impact on the biology of stroma and other cellular (and non-cellular) elements of
TME, fashioning a bidirectional relationship between the tumor and TME. Within
hematological malignancies, as in models of solid tumorigenesis, TME has been shown to
evolve with malignancy and demonstrate sustained gene expression changes that support
critical aspects of tumor growth.16–18 Thus the bidirectional relationship between malignant
B cells and their TME is an integral part of tumor initiation, progression and responsiveness
to anticancer therapies.4,5,7
TME CONFERS THERAPY RESISTANCE, MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE AND SURVIVAL

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The role of TME in drug response and survival has been relatively well characterized. Even
with significant improvements in therapeutics and supportive care available for the
management of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM), these malignancies
represent largely incurable diseases. Mortality is frequently the consequence of refractory
disease, a phenomenon that had long been attributed to the acquisition of heritable
mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR). However, it is clear that treatment failure was
the consequence of more than a stochastic drug exposure phenomenon and that other
microenvironmental factors also contributed to MDR.19 The unique tropism of mature Bcell tumors to lymph nodes, the bone marrow (BM) or other secondary lymphoid organs
suggested that the niches affords a survival advantage. As such, local microenvironmental
determinants would afford resident cells a therapy resistance resulting in small foci of
residual disease that subsequently develop complex genetic or epigenetic means of acquired
resistance in response to the selective pressure of therapy. TME consists of physical
extracellular matrix components and supportive fibroblast-like stromal cells that are critical
for the dynamic interplay between these chemokine/cytokine networks, cellular adhesion
molecules and the cellular components of TME.

These extrinsic effectors of TME translate to intrinsic biochemical signaling cascades
modulating drug resistance.4,9,12 Over 10 years ago, we were among the first to observe that
malignant B-cell survival and drug response was subject to regulation by TME.2,20 Instead
of stable acquired mechanisms of MDR, we and the others demonstrated that there also exist
dynamic, de novo mechanisms of drug resistance coordinated by both the soluble and
physical effectors of TME.4,7,21 In 1999, Damiano et al.2 demonstrated that interactions
between the extracellular matrix component fibronectin and myeloma cells via β1 integrincontaining heterodimers conferred cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance, a form of de novo
drug resistance that protects tumor cells from the effects of diverse therapies. Interleukin
(IL)-6, a putative myeloma survival cytokine, has also been shown to confer a survival
advantage to myeloma cells via JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription) induced regulation of the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL.20 Subsequently,
adhesion of malignant hematopoietic cells to extracellular matrix and stromal cells has been
demonstrated to confer a survival advantage in the face of therapeutics and host antitumor
cell death pathways via a multitude of processes.4,10,22,23 Lwin et al.24 demonstrated that

direct contact with the human BM stromal cells (BMSCs) afforded resistance to spontaneous
and drug-induced apoptosis in various lymphomas. In MM, stroma-induced activation of
nuclear factor (NF)-κB, PIM1, Notch and MYC and other critical survival and drug
response pathways have been observed and contribute to EMDR.5 These data demonstrated
that interactions of malignant B cells with TME facilitates a drug-resistant phenotype.

Author Manuscript

In the context of these tumor-stroma induced events, it is apparent that EMDR arises from
adaptive, reciprocal signaling circuits between tumor cells and the stromal elements of TME
via positive feedback/feedforward loops.5 These signaling dialogues are the result of
alterations in intracellular signaling within the tumor cells and stromal cells induced by their
interactions within TME.4,5,25 TME-interacting malignant B cells undergo wholescale
changes in the transcriptome with alteration expression of cellular processess controlling
interactions with TME as well as the expression of cytokines and growth factors that control
critical pathways for survival and drug resistance.10,17,26 In B-cell lymphomas, this has been
indirectly demonstrated with distinct TME-induced gene expression profiles when
comparing lymph node-resident tumor cells with circulating tumor cells.17 In chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, gene expression profiles from peripheral blood versus lymph noderesident tumor cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of B-cell receptor
(BCR) pathway genes in lymph node microenvironment relative to circulating cells,27
indicating that TME acts by modulating sustained BCR signaling. Further evidence
supporting BCR signaling pathway in TME-induced survival signals comes from the in vitro
effects of BCR kinase inhibitors SYK inhibition with R406,28 phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase
δ (PI3Kδ) inhibitor Idelalisib/GS110129,30 and Ibrutinib/PCI32765-mediated inhibition of
BTK in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and MM.31–33 Collectively, these data indicate that BCR
and likely other apical proteins/kinases are critical to orchestrating bidirectional
collaborative communication between tumor cells and BMSCs (or other cellular elements of
TME) that facilitate EMDR and ultimately result in residual disease in the setting of
therapeutic stress and disease recurrence.
TME SUSTAINS MALIGNANT B-CELL GROWTH AND PROLIFERATION

Author Manuscript

As discussed, chemokines and cytokines function to recruit tumor cells to TME where
positive cytokine- and cell adhesion-mediated feedback loops are established between the
malignant B cells and stromal cells.4 These intercellular positive feedback loops not only
support the survival and drug resistance but also facilitate the growth and proliferation of
malignant B cells. Paracrine mitogenic signals supplied by stromal cells in lymph node and
BM are implicated in different lymphoma types ranging from the initiation of aberrant
proliferation to the cell-autonomous tumor progression. Upon adhesion to stromal cells,
malignant cells as well as stromal cells produce and secrete a host of soluble factors
associated with malignant B-cell growth.4,24,34 Further, TME, specifically stromal cells,
have also been shown to regulate sustained c-Myc activation facilitating lymphoma cell
growth and proliferation.35
B-cell activating factor (BAFF) as well as its receptors, particularly BAFF-R, are critical
factors for the growth and survival of both normal and malignant B cells.36 Our group also
demonstrated that B-cell lymphoma adhesion-induced BAFF expression by BMSCs

promoted lymphoma cells growth in B-cell lymphomas via activation of NF-κB signaling
events.37,38 Overall, B-cell and stromal cell interactions generate TME niches for
lymphomas with high BAFF availability to promote lymphoma growth. In addition to
BAFF, IL-6 remains the prototypical growth and survival factor in myeloma as well as Bcell lymphomas.39 IL-6 binds its receptors on lymphoma cells facilitating the
phosphorylation of gp130 and initiation of Ras/Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase,
kinase–extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2, PI3K and JAK/STAT3 signaling.40
Each of these signal transduction pathways has been implicated in IL-6-mediated
proliferation. Autocrine and/or paracrine IL-6 is involved in mantle cell lymphoma
growth.41 Importantly, paracrine IL-6 in lymphomagenesis is context-specific. In
transformed but not immature B cells, B-cell lymphomas use paracrine IL-6 signaling as a
growth-promoting signal, implicating complex regulation of lymphoma development by the
microenvironment and transformative genetic events.40 It is critical to note that other
cytokines and/or adhesion molecules also contribute to the cross-talk between stroma and
lymphoma/myeloma cells: IL-7, vascular endothelial growth fractor (VEGF), C-X-C motif
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), RANTES (regulated and normal T cell expressed and
secreted), macrophage-inflammatory protein-1, JAGGED-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 and
IL-21 to list a few.42–46 TME can also support malignant B-cell proliferation via additional
ligand-receptor siganling conduits. Hedgehog ligands produced by stromal cells have been
demonstrated to promote proliferation of B-cell lymphomas and myeloma in the context of
TME both in vitro and in vivo.47,48 Hedgehog ligands produced by follicular dendritic cells
promote growth of germinal center B cells.47 In MM, BMSCs promoted CD138-isolated
patient cell expansion in a hedgehog-dependent fashion.49 Together, these data demonstrate
that dynamic interections between tumor cells and TME can promote malignant B-cell
proliferation. It may also be expected that within TME these effectors do not act in isolation;
as such, the combination of secreted factors and cell adhesion mechanisms act in concert to
dictate malignant B-cell proliferation.25

Author Manuscript

TME has been shown to promote malignant B-cell proliferation via the regulation of the
oncogene c-Myc. Adhesion of mantle cell lymphoma and other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
cells to lymph node and BM stromal cells has been shown to promote lymphoma clonogenic
growth in vitro and in vivo.35 This stroma-enhanced clonogenicity and tumor formation has
also been observed in MM.50 This clonogenic advantage is, at least in part, modulated by
intracellular bidirectional circuitry induced by TME. Stroma-induced c-Myc activation was
shown to contribute to lymphoma growth and progression via a stroma-triggered c-Myc–
miR-548 feedforward loop leading to sustained c-Myc activation.35 Critically, disruption of
this circuit suppressed clonogenicity and lymphoma growth ex vivo and in vivo. We also
observed induction of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) by stroma in lymphoma cells
consistent with a MYC–miRNA–EZH2 positive feedback loop in aggressively transformed
lymphoma.51,52 Similarly, targeting c-Myc produces a potent antiproliferative effect in in
vivo models of MM.53
These data indicate that the mechanisms by which stroma influence tumor proliferation are
complex, potentially representing convergence of stroma-induced and genetically
determined cellular functions. Consistent with this, stromal interactions have been shown to

enhance the transcriptional output of these signaling cascades, even when they are
constitutively activated by mutational events.5 For instance, recurrent lesions for genetically
driven alterations in B-cell malignancies such as mutational activation of RAS, NF-κB,
PI3K-AKT and STAT3 pathways as well as MYC amplifications can be further activated by
stromal cells.5,7 Malignant B cells are therefore poised for an increased capacity for
proliferation via the production of ligands from tumor and/or stromal cells resulting in
autocrine and paracrine networks. During the multistep transformation and malignant
progression, both malignant B cells and stromal cells adapt to maintain the constitutive
activation of signaling pathways.35,54,55
TME IS CENTRAL TO THE ADHESION, MIGRATION AND INVASION OF MALIGNANT B
CELLS

Author Manuscript

Localization to the appropriate niche is critical for B-cell development and selection.
Migration and adhesion of malignant and normal B cells to the BM and secondary lymphoid
tissues are, in part, modulated by the homeostatic chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
12 (CXCL12)/stromal cell-derived factor 1 produced by stromal cells of a given niche and
its cognate receptor CXCR4.56,57 Additional chemokines are also critical to this process,
including CXCR13 and IL-8.11 As an example, we will focus on CXCL12 and CXCR4.
CXCL12 produced by TME modulates homing of B cells to TME by inducing both the
expression of integrin subunits and by inducing inside-out activation of integrins.4 Of note,
the converse has also been observed; integrins also modulate both increased CXCR4
expression and function.4 To this end, the relationship between CXCR4 and the integrin
heterodimer VLA4 (very late antigen 4) is complex, constituting bidirectional outside-in and
inside-out signaling system modulating malignant B-cell motility.

Author Manuscript

As with drug response and proliferation, malignant B-cell motility arises from adaptive,
reciprocal signaling dialogues between tumor cells and TME cells via positive feedback/
feedforward loops.4,35,56 Accumulating evidence indicates that BCR is integral in this
bidirectional signaling between chemokine receptors and integrins contributing to migration
and cell adhesion in B-cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell
lymphoma and MM.58,59 BCR governs the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic
CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated migration and VLA4-mediated adhesion.56,60 Specific targeting
of SYK with the inhibitor R406 attenuated CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor 1-mediated
malignant B-cell homing signals.61 BCR has also been shown to induce VLA4 high-affinity
binding via sequential activation of the components of BCR effectors.58 Direct clinical
translation of the critical role of BCR in malignant B-cell motility has been demonstrated in
early-stage clinical trials with SYK inhibitor FosD,62 BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib63 and PI3Kδ
inhibitor GS-1101/Idelalisib64 with clinical responses characterized by an early
redistribution of tissue-resident chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells into the blood, resulting
in rapid resolution of lymphadenopathy and organomegaly, along with a transient surge in
lymphocytosis during the first weeks of therapy consistent with the attenuated B-cell
migration to and adhesion within TME.65 Together, these data underscore the clinical
opportunities defined by targeting TME to disrupt tumor–stromal interactions releasing cells
from the niche and sensitizing cells to therapy.

TME PROMOTES ANGIOGENESIS

Author Manuscript

A number of studies have implicated increased microvessel density with disease state and
worse outcomes, suggesting that increased niche angiogenesis is an important requirement
for disease progression.66–69 Compelling evidence stems from the examination of BM
microvessel density along the myeloma continuum showing a greater density in patients
with active disease relative to patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance.66 Du et al.66 demonstrated that microvessel density increased from normal BM
samples to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to active disease. Tumor
vascularization has also been demonstrated to be higher in lymphoma tissue than in reactive
lymph nodes.67 These results indicate a critical role of the vascular component of TME in
the progression of B-cell malignancies.

As we have discussed, malignant B cells and MM cells not only benefit from the normal
effectors within TME but also contribute to the environment. Malignant B cells, endothelial
cells (and other stromal cells) and non-cellular components of TME contribute to
neovascularization within lymph nodes and the BM.70,71 The most prominent effector of
angiogenesis is the VEGF. In myeloma, VEGF has been shown to induce growth, survival
as well as migration of cells in an autocrine manner via VEGFR-1.72 Moreover, paracrine
activation of BM endothelial cells (ECs) VEGFR-2 modulates angiogenesis.70 Studies have
also identified BM ECs that produce growth and invasive factors for myeloma cells,
including VEGF, fibroblast growth factor-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2, IL-8, stromal cellderived factor 1-α and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 as well as matrix
metalloproteinase-9.70,73 In turn, VEGF produced by myeloma cells can similarly prolong
survival of ECs.72 Myeloma cells and BMSCs can also promote EC function by attenuating
the secretion of antiangiogenic factors.70 Similar scenarios are also seen in TME of other Bcell malignancies. In mantle cell lymphoma, both lymphoma cell-derived autocrine
signaling and paracrine signaling to stromal cells of blood and lymphatic vessels have been
shown to mediate lymphoma cell survival and lymph node EC activities, respectively.71,74
Together, these results demonstrate that in B-cell lymphomas and MM neoangiogenesis is
regulated by an reciprocal network of interactions based on the production of growth factors
deriving from malignant cells and from accessory cells of TME.
TME FACILITATES IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE NICHE

Author Manuscript

Similar to many other cancers, B-cell malignant progression is accompanied by profound
immune suppression that interferes with an effective antitumor response and tumor
elimination.14,75–77 A growing body of evidence indicates that interaction among lymphoma
cells, stromal cells and neighboring immune cells regulate antitumor immunity. Using gene
expression profiles on whole lymphoma tissues, Lenz et al.76 identified ‘stromal’ signatures
predictive of good and bad survival rates, respectively, in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
that were differentiated by an immune component to the stromal signature. Gene expression
profiles of follicular lymphomas further supports that the immune microenvironment has an
important role in the outcome as genes expressed by infiltrating T cells and macrophages are
among the most important predictors of survival.18 Moreover, upon transformation of
follicular lymphoma to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, nearly two-thirds of the
most discriminative genes were related cellular immune response and inflammatory

processes.78,79 These data indicate that interactions between malignant B cells, immune
cells and stromal cells engender an ‘immune-suppressive’ TME via the regulation of
immune cell differentiation, recruitment of regulatory T cells, suppressive tumor-associated
monocytes/marcophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

Author Manuscript

Regulatory T cells are a specific subset of T cells that are essential for maintaining immune
tolerance that have been observed in increased numbers in TME of B-cell malignancies.80,81
Regulatory T cells inhibit T-cell responses against both foreign antigens and self-antigens
such as tumor antigens by attenuating effector immune responses mediated by CD4 and
CD8 T cells through the production of immunosuppressive cytokines.82 These data indicate
that regulatory T cells can contribute to immune escape of the neoplastic clone as well as
influencing B-cell differentiation and maturation process. Macrophages are part of the
immune infiltrate found in a variety of lymphomas and myeloma. Increased numbers and/or
density of intratumoral macrophages is associated with both progression and prognosis Bcell malignancies.83 Lymphoma cells and stromal cells produce chemokines and growth
factors that produce tumor-associated monocytes/marcophages. These tumor-associated
monocytes/marcophages induce immune suppression through several mechanisms involving
regulation of antitumoural immunity through interactions with the malignant clone as well
as other TME cellular components.84,85 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells represent another
immunosuppressive cell population related to macrophages. These cells have the capacity to
suppress both the cytotoxic activities of natural killer and natural killer T cells as well as the
adaptive immune response mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.86 Recent studies
demonstrated that immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells accumulate in the
BM of patients with MM as well as in the BM of MM-bearing immunocompetent mice
promoting tumor progression.87,88

TME PROMOTES ‘STEMNESS’ LINKED TO SUSTAINED SELF-RENEWAL CAPACITY

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidence now has shown that TME has a critical role in supporting what are
termed cancer stem cells (CSC). CSCs, also known as ‘tumor-initiating cells,’ are the cancer
cell population that carries functional properties of stem cells: self-renewal, the capability to
differentiate into multiple lineages in the tumor, and the potential to proliferate extensively
to expand the malignant cell population.89 Although the exact nature of the CSC in B-cell
malignancies remains controversial, subpopulations of cells have been identfied with selfrenewal capacity.50,90,91 Hematological CSCs may arise from self-renewing stem cells by
the acquisition of mutations or from more differentiated cells that gain CSC-like
properties.17,92,93 Similar to normal stem cells that are maintained within specialized niches,
CSCs also rely on TME. These niches are important for the control of CSC survival and
proliferation.92 Thus the microenvironment likely has an important role in promoting and
conferring stemness, CSC self-renewal and primary tumor progression.94 Unlike most stem
cells that are restricted to the least differentiated cell types, both germinal center and
memory B cells reside in germinal centers, interact with stromal cells, differentiate into
mature cells and possess self-renewal potential that allows rapid lymphocyte division and
antigen-specific immunity. The renewal and differentiation capacity of the germinal center
lymphocytes upon antigen stimulation has suggested that secondary lymphoid organs are
ideal niches to confer lymphocyte stem cell-like features (stemness) through stroma-

mediated genetic and epigenetic means. Indeed, most B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are
truly derived from either committed lymphoid progenitor/precursor cells or from more
mature B-lymphocytes in germinal centers.11 Given the close contact of lymphoma cells and
stromal cells in the lymph node and BM microenvironment, malignant reprogramming may
be achieved through stroma-mediated regulation of genes controlling a stemness pathway.35
Our recent studies on TME have revealed that stromal cells can modulate stemness by
promoting B-cell differentiation and enhancing lymphoma cell clonogenicity.35,51 Further,
recent experiments have shown that stromal cells activate c-Myc, EZH2, Oct-4, Nanong and
Sox2, key elements in acquisition and maintenance of stem cell properties.95,96 Collectively,
these results suggest that lymphoma cells interacting with stroma display characteristics of
CSC. It is tempting to speculate that lymphoma microenvironment or lymphoma/stroma
interactions are the driving force for the initiation and maintenance of the replicative
immortality of CSC in malignant B-cell disorders.

Author Manuscript

Another critical aspect of replicative immortality is the control of telomere length. Evidence
of the necessity of telomerase activity in B-cell malignancies comes from the observation of
increased telomerase activity with progression from monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance to active MM.97 Increased telomerase activity observed in
myeloma is regulated by TME effectors IL-6 and insulin-like growth factor-1 in myeloma
cell lines and myeloma patient specimens.98 Furthermore, both IL-6 and insulin-like growth
factor-1 overcame dexamethasone-induced attenuation of telomerase activity. Together,
these results indicated that TME has profound effects on stemness and self-renewal in
mature B-cell neoplasms.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Malignant B-cell tumorigenesis is a complex collection of distinct genetic diseases
characterized by common hallmarks. Here we describe a conceptual framework by which
TME contributes to these hallmarks in B-cell malignancies. In the context of malignant B
cells, TME shapes a common set of malignant properties (hallmarks), including sustained
proliferation, self-renewal capacity and stemness, homing and invasion, immune evasion
and angiogenesis as well as resistance to cell death.99 For lymphomas and myeloma to
evolve and progress, malignant B cells manipulate their TME to fulfill these hallmarks
through reciprocal interactions with surrounding cellular and non-cellular elements. As
shown in Figure 3, the malignant progression is a complex process of interconnected levels
of signaling events. First, the extracellular circuits of malignant B cells with tumorassociated monocytes/marcophages, immune cells, stromal cells and EC (Figure 3a). The
interactions between the malignant B cells and TME cells are dynamic, bidirectional
paracrine (or autocrine) leading to recruitment and activation (or suppression) of partner
cellular populations. Both neoplastic cells and the cellular elements of TME evolve
progressively through heterotypic signaling between tumor and stroma cells that modulate
the release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and recruitment of cellular TME
effectors facilitating malignant progression. Second, the intercellular circuits between
lymphoma/myeloma cells and TME that establish positive cytokine and cell-adhesionmediated feedforward loops that promote homing of tumor cells as well as cell-adhesion and
soluble factor-induced signaling events (Figure 3b). BCR can function as a central

modulator of the interplay between the inside-out and outside-in CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated
migration and VLA4-mediated adhesion leading to enhanced receptor signaling and cell
adhesion.4 Third, intracellular circuits—the intercellular interaction-triggered intracellular
signaling circuits that drive cancer hallmarks (Figure 3c). Stroma through combination of
secreted factors and cell adhesion mechanisms further enhance numerous inter-related
signaling pathways, including BCR–PI3K–AKT, NF-κB, RAS–RAF–MAPK, JAK–STAT–
HIF1α, c-MYC, ERK and Notch pathways. Moreover, in order to sustain hallmark features,
tumor cells’ positive feedforward signaling loops such as BCR-NF-κB, IL-6-STAT3 and
miRNA-Myc circuitry lead to increased transcriptional and posttranscriptional
events.35,54,55 The collaboration and concerted action between these three levels of
reciprocal networks drive the hallmarks of B-cell malignancies.

Author Manuscript

Together, these results demonstrated that it is critical that we identify the appropriate factors
within the complex network of the tumor cell microenvironment to target in the context of
therapy. By elucidating the role of the TME and the crucial steps of TME–lymphoma
interaction in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancy, recent studies have provided the
framework for identifying and validating novel therapies that target both tumor cells and
cells in their surrounding microenvironment. Targeting the TME can be implemented
through several strategies to discrupt the circuits outlined above: (1) attacking cellular
component of TME niche and inhibiting abnormally activated pathways within the cells of
niche; (2) affecting homing and adhesion through interference with chemokines and
adhesion molecules to target the communication between malignant cells and TME; and (3)
targeting TME-induced intracellular signaling pathways to block the prosurvival and
proliferative signals in malignant B cells as well as stromal cells.

survival and progression are established in concert with these effector cells. Controlling
angiogenesis is clearly a strategy for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.69 This can be
achieved either by directly targeting VEGF with monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab or
targeting the upstream or downstream molecules of VEGF signaling. It is possible that
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with an increased tumor blood-vessel density/
stromal-2 signature76 and other aggressive B-cell malignancies would benefit from targeting
inhibitors of angiogenesis. Disruption of migratory and adhesion signals represents the
strategy of attenuating malignant B-cell homing to a niche and/or sensitizing tumor cells to
chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Small-molecule pharmacological inhibitors of CXCR4
have been shown to be efficacious in preclinical models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
B-cell lymphomas and MM,100,101 presumably through interference of TME homing and
recruitment of tumor cells out of their protective microenvironmental niches. Cellpenetrating lipidated peptides targeting CXCR4 intracellular domains also significantly
increase the antitumoral activity of rituximab in vitro and in vivo.102 Another approach is to
implement neutralizing VLA4 antibody and small-molecule inhibitors of VLA4/vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 to disrupt the TME interactions and cause impressive mobilization
out of TME protective niche. Anti-VLA4 antibody natalizumab has been evaluated as an
alternative stromal adhesion-disruptive drug.103 Targeting TME using D-amino acid peptides

to prevent cell adhesion has proven to induce myeloma cell death and increase sensitivity to
known active agents, including melphalan and bortezomib.104 Additionally, lenalidomide,
an immunomodulatory drug clinically active in several mature B-cell malignancies and
under evaluation in follicular lymphomas, could disrupt B cell–stroma interaction through a
decrease in both CXCL12 production by stromal cells and RhoH expression in malignant B
cells.105,106 Further, the end result of TME–tumor interaction is activation of various interrelated signaling cascades in malignant B cells and subsequently dictate growth, response to
therapy and drive TME–tumor interaction and hallmarks. Therefore, these signaling
pathways serve as potential therapeutic targets. Of these signaling pathways, the BCR and
its downstream effectors are emerging as central modulators of B-cell homing, survival and
drug resistance within the context of B-cell microenvironment.6,28,107–109 As such, the BCR
may serve as a central hub at the crossroads between extrinsic and intrinsic events. More
specifically, in addition to activation of PI3K–AKT and NF-κB pathways, BCR orchestrates
the interplay between outside-in and inside-out by CXCR4, integrins and other key effectors
of the TME, thereby having a critical role in malignant B-cell homing, survival and EMDR.4
Therefore targeting the BCR pathway molecules will attenuate growth and survival signals
emanating from both B-cell intrinsic abnormalities and from the TME, serving as a novel
‘double-hit’ strategy: targeting both BCR-regulated survival signaling and BCR-regulated
lymphoma–TME interactions releasing lymphoma cells from their microenvironment,
resulting in sensitization and enhanced cytotoxic killing. This hypothesis has been
substantiated by recent clinical trials of BTK inhibitors in B-cell lymphoma patients with
encouraging results.110–112 In support of this, an example is the recent success of using the
PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor CAL-101/GS1011/Idalelisib in the treatment of B-cell lymphoid
malignancies.113–117 These promising effects are likely due to the concomitant action of the
drug in both tumor and TME. For example, in malignant B cells, PI3Kδ blockade impairs
pro-survival signaling and induces tumor cell death. On the other hand, inhibition of PI3Kδ
in monocyte-derived cells of the lymph node stroma blocks the secretion of pro-survival
chemokines sensed by tumor cells and strengthens the pro-apoptotic effect of the drug.113
These demonstrate the principles behind drug design in the context of the
microenvironment. The BCR inhibitors discussed above target both extracellular and
intracellular determinants of the BM niche. The hope is that we can identify the appropriate
factors within the complex network of the tumor cell microenvironment to target. To this
end, we may divine therapies to overcome the coordinated effort between lymphoma/MM
cells and the microenvironment. In so doing, we may be also able interrupt the sequence of
events (de novo and acquired) facilitating minimal residual disease culminating in therapy
resistance.

However, it is not likely that singly targeted therapies will demonstrate lasting control of
disease with the significant heterogeneity within the BM and/or lymph node niche. As such,
the development of rationally designed combination therapies will be critical to further
clinical success. To this end, targeting of multiple pathways either simultaneously or in
sequence may be the measure by which to overcome the sanctuary of TME milieu. Stromainduced BCR/BTK/PI3K and c-Myc pathways cooperatively dictate interaction (adhesion)
between lymphoma and stroma and promote lymphoma drug resistance and proliferation.
Disruption of both pathways establishes a novel ‘triple-hit’ or ‘multi-hit’ strategy: targeting

the pathway (BCR/PI3K) related to survival, targeting the pathway (c-Myc) related to cell
proliferation and lymphoma angiogenesis, and targeting lymphoma–stroma adhesion to
release lymphoma cells from their microenvironment to sensitize and enhance cytotoxic
killing. Additionally, tumor cells respond, adapt and co-evolve before, during and after
treatment and results in consequence of therapy resistance.118,119 It will be important to
consider the merit of combinatorially targeting downstream (BCR) signaling pathways to
hold advantage of direct modulation of the cell survival and proliferation machinery with
targeting upstream or parallel pathways to circumvent compensatory survival pathway. In
contrast, tumor-associated stromal cells presumably may also ‘adapt and evolve’ and,
therefore, constitute an alternative therapeutic target. A recent in vitro and in vivo study
demonstrated that upregulated stromal PKC-βII and NF-κB are prerequisites to support the
survival of malignant B cells in a variety of B-cell malignancies and constitute a potential
target.120 Going forward, the challenge will be to identify the optimal combinations of drugs
to appropriately modulate both tumor cells and TME in the most selective manner possible.
Furthermore, the continued success of BCR and other inhibitor therapy in lymphoma/MM
will require the rational design of combination of targeted agents and a deep understanding
of the nature between the malignant B cells and their TME.

The development of EMDR, minimal residual disease (MRD), acquired resistance and
disease progression. The mechanisms of drug resistance have been defined by genetically
acquired changes in the expression or function of specific genes. The conventional
explanation is that mutations form spontaneously and randomly before (or during) cancer
has undergone chemotherapy, and these rare preexisting mutations may be selected for
resistance under therapeutic stress. However, over the past 10 years a large body of evidence
has emerged demonstrating that in addition to mechanisms of drug resistance intrinsic to the
cancer cell, there exist dynamic, extrinsic mechanisms coordinated by the TME resulting in
an EMDR. EMDR is a form of de novo drug resistance that protects tumor cells from the
initial effects of diverse therapies by two primary mechanisms: soluble factor-mediated drug
resistance and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Specific niches within the lymphoma/
myeloma microenvironment provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of tumor cells and
provide a survival advantage through stromal cell–tumor cell interaction, allowing them to
survive the insult of therapy, resulting in MRD. Over time, the residual tumor (lymphoma)
cells are then destined to expand and evolve through (a.) acquisition of additional genetic
abnormalities or (b.) selection of preexisting clones during therapy that cause the gradual
development of more complex, diverse and permanent acquired-resistance phenotypes. The
persistent tumor cells eventually cause disease relapse, much less likely to respond to
subsequent therapy after acquired resistance develops and ultimately aggressive progression
of lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

TME shapes the hallmarks of B-cell malignancies. Malignant B cells (lymphoma and
myeloma) recruit and activate TME stromal cells, including immune cells, angiogenic
vascular cells and fibroblastic cells, and, in turn, TME stromal cells profoundly influence the
behavior of B-cell malignancies. The collaborative interaction between neoplastic B cells
and their supporting stromal cells enable and sustain the hallmarks of cancer, including
resistance to cell death (anti-apoptosis and drug resistance), sustaining cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, immune suppression, stemness and self-renewal and cell homing and invasion,
thus promoting tumor progression.

Reciprocal signaling networks modulated by TME drive malignant B-cell tumor progression
and response to therapy. As malignant B cells accumulate in the niche, positive cytokine and
cell adhesion-mediated feedforward loops/circuits are established between the tumor and
TME that facilitate the progression of the malignant clone. (a) Extracellular circuits: Tumor
(lymphoma/myeloma) cells recruit and orchestrate the activity of accessory cells, including
vascular endothelial cells, fibroblast-like stromal cells, immune and inflammatory cells, via
autocrine and paracrine signaling. These extracellular signals trigger amplification loops
fostering increased production of cytokines/chemokines and recruitment of additional
cellular effectors. This, in turn, supports a survival and proliferative advantage in the face of
endogenous and therapeutic stresses. (b) Intercellular circuits: Interactions between
malignant B cells and TME facilitate critical alterations in signaling in both tumor cells and
stromal cells. Central to these events are ‘inside-in’ and ‘outside-in’ signaling loops
involving chemokines, cytokines, integrins and BCR signaling activation. Stromal cells
induce sustained BCR signaling leading to chemokine and integrin activation in malignant B
cells. In turn, tumor cells directly and indirectly elicit alterations in stromal cells via cell–
cell receptor–ligand contact and soluble factors. Together these networks result in enhanced
receptor signaling and cellular adhesion. (c) Intracellular circuits: Tumor/TME signaling
stimulates intracellular feedforward signaling loops that sustain signals emitted by ligandactivated receptors and integrins. Examples of signaling loops include BCR-NF-κB, IL-6STAT3 and miRNA-Myc circuitry leading to sustained transcriptional and
posttranscriptional events. Collectively, these inter-related and intra-related signaling
cascades dictate the nature of TME vis-à-vis the hallmarks of B-cell malignancies. As the
tumor progresses, the tumor and TME co-evolves into an activated state through continuous
bidirectional communication, thus creating dynamic signaling circuitries that promote
tumor/TME interactions.
