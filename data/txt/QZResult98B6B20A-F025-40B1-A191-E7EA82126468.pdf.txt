Abstract
Osteosarcoma remains a leading cause of cancer death in adolescents. Treatment paradigms and survival rates
have not improved in two decades. Driving the lack of therapeutic inroads, the molecular etiology of osteosarcoma
remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have demonstrated far-reaching effects on the cellular biology of
development and cancer. Their role in osteosarcomagenesis remains largely unexplored. Here we identify for
the ﬁrst time an miRNA signature reﬂecting the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma from surgically procured samples
from human patients. The signature includes high expression of miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181c as well as
reduced expression of miR-16, miR-29b, and miR-142-5p. We also demonstrate that miR-181b and miR-29b exhibit
restricted expression to distinct cell populations in the tumor tissue. Further, higher expression of miR-27a and
miR-181c in pre-treatment biopsy samples characterized patients who developed clinical metastatic disease. In
addition, higher expression of miR-451 and miR-15b in pre-treatment samples correlated with subsequent positive
response to chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo functional validation in osteosarcoma cell lines conﬁrmed the
tumor suppressive role of miR-16 and the pro-metastatic role of miR-27a. Furthermore, predicted target genes for
miR-16 and miR-27a were conﬁrmed as down-regulated by real-time PCR. Affymetrix array proﬁling of cDNAs
from the osteosarcoma specimens and controls were interrogated according to predicted targets of miR-16,
miR142-5p, miR-29b, miR-181a/b, and miR-27a. This analysis revealed positive and negative correlations
highlighting pathways of known importance to osteosarcoma, as well as novel genes. Thus, our ﬁndings establish
a miRNA signature associated with pathogenesis of osteosarcoma as well as critical pre-treatment biomarkers of
metastasis and responsiveness to therapy. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1865–77. 2012 AACR.

propagate osteosarcomagenesis remain poorly understood (2).
Most OSs (approximately 90%) are termed "conventional" and
have osteoblastic and/or ﬁbroblastic histologic patterns with
consistently high-grade nuclear morphologies. Two common
alternate histologic subtypes, chondroblastic, characterized by
cartilaginous tissues in the tumor, and telangiectatic, characterized by abundant vascular and cystic spaces in the tumor,
are also often high grade. When these other subtypes are high
grade, they are treated with conventional OS treatment regimens (3).
The genetic and cytogenetic complexity intrinsic to OS make
deciphering the origins of its very patterned clinical phenotype
especially difﬁcult. Inability to determine which, among the
many genetic derangements present in OS, such as aneuploidy,
rampant mutations, and manifold copy number variations, are
causative of and which are resultant from oncogenic transformation remains a major impediment to progress in understanding its etiology (2). Nonetheless, the consistent clinical
pattern of osteosarcomagenesis, characterized by rapid onset
of high-grade neoplasms in young people, suggests that some
yet undetected, but consistent etiologic event or group of
events deﬁnes the neoplasm.

single miRNA can silence a large number of genes, granting
these molecules extensive control over many cellular functions
(4). Knowledge of individual miRNAs effecting developmental
biology, cellular differentiation programs, and oncogenesis
continues to grow (reviewed in ref. 5). Although speciﬁc
miRNAs have been functionally evaluated in a few OS cell
lines (6–9), and miRNA expression proﬁled in formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded OS specimens (10), high quality total RNA
from primary OS tissues has been collected prospectively in
few centers (11). Appreciating the vast effects possible from
oncogenic and other miRNAs, we surveyed a well-characterized group of OSs with array-based technologies. Differential
expression proﬁles were validated with quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), in situ hybridization, and functional validation in human OS cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.
Our studies have shown proﬁles including differential expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs, reﬂecting OS
status.

Materials and Methods
Patients, sample procurement, and isolation of total RNA
With approval of the Institutional Review Board and in
compliance with all legal and ethical considerations for human
subject research, patients presenting with suspected sarcomas
and scheduled for incisional biopsies provided informed consent to have their tissue banked for RNA extraction. Specimens
were obtained during these open surgical biopsies, gently
washed with normal saline to remove excess blood, and placed
immediately into RNAlater (Ambion) by the surgeon. Specimens were kept at 4 C in RNAlater for up to 1 week, then stored
at 80 C. When formal pathologic interpretation of histology
from other portions of the biopsy specimen rendered a diagnosis of OS, the RNA-preserving tissue specimens were banked
and annotated. In preparation for these speciﬁc experiments,
total RNA was extracted from banked specimens with the
TRIzol reagent and method (Invitrogen). Control samples were
derived from to-be-discarded bone fragments obtained from
similarly consented patients undergoing debridement surgeries for acute, traumatic injuries to the long bones.
Microarray proﬁling of miRNA and mRNA expression
miRNA microarray was conducted as previously described
(12). The integrity of these total RNAs was assessed with an
Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Total RNA (5 mg) was hybridized on
the custom microarray chip (OSUCCC miRNA microchip,
version 3.0). This array contains approximately 1,100 probes
(including 345 human and 249 mouse miRNA genes spotted in
duplicate). Normalized microarray data were managed and
analyzed by BRB-ArrayTools, version 3.8.1 (13). Genes whose
expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the median, in at
least 20% of the arrays were used. A stringent signiﬁcance
threshold was used to limit the number of false positive
ﬁndings. The result of this approach was determined by 2
sample t test with nominal signiﬁcance level at 0.01. The false
discovery rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of positive
results that are false positives at the various levels of significance and was controlled using the step-up method of Benjamini and Hochberg. In this analysis, at any selected FDR level,

1866

the expected proportion of false positives was determined.
Class prediction algorithms determined whether miRNA
expression patterns could accurately differentiate between OS
samples and normal human bone controls. We developed
models based on the compound covariate predictor, nearest
neighbor classiﬁcation, and support vector machine. The
models incorporated genes that were differentially expressed
among genes at the signiﬁcance level (0.05) as assessed by the
random variance t test. We used the prediction test to identify
the classiﬁer signature with the lowest misclassiﬁcation error.
For the mRNA proﬁling, 14 of the cohort's OS and 4 of
the control samples were hybridized with the Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The CEL ﬁles were
imported and robust multi-array averaging normalized. Genes
whose expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the median
in at least 20% of the arrays were used. We carried out class
comparisons algorithms in BRB-ArrayTools with the paired
t test (P < 0.05). The union of the target mRNAs was used as an
input to DAVID EASE, using the David Bioinformatics
Resources system (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). We compared the list of terms related to the predicted targeted mRNAs.
The terms were evaluated by P value (P < 0.05) and Benjamini–
Hochberg correction for multiple testing controlled the P
values. Target genes selection was carried out by Target Scan
software. We evaluated Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/) and PATHWAY (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
terms.
RT-PCR validation
TaqMan miRNA assays were used to detect and quantify
mature miRNAs as previously described (14) using ABI Prism
7900HT sequence detection systems (Applied Biosystems).
Normalization was carried out with RNA U6. Samples were
run in triplicate, including no-template controls. Relative
expression was calculated by the comparative Ct method.
qRT-PCR to conﬁrm expression levels in cell lines following
transfection with lentiviral vectors was carried out according
to a previously described protocol (15). Primers used are noted
Supplementary Table S6.
In situ hybridization
Detection of miRNAs by in situ hybridization was conducted
as previously published (16, 17). Locked nucleic acid (LNA)modiﬁed probes were 50 labeled with digoxigenin (Exiqon).
After protease digestion to expose the target, 2 pmoles/mL of
the probe was hybridized to the tissue section for 15 hours,
then subjected to a low stringency wash. The probe-target
complex was visualized by alkaline phosphatase activity on the
chromogen nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl
phosphate (Roche Diagnostics) after nuclear fast red counterstain. Coexpression analyses was conducted with the Nuance
system as previously published (17).
Cell lines and cell culture
Cell lines (HOS, KHOS, SaOS2, U2OS, and MG-63) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and hOB
from PromoCell. LM7 is a gift from Dr. Dennis Hughes (The
University of Texas MD Anderson). Each line was authenticated

as to genotype and phenotype by the source company. Cells were
used at low passage for experiments, always less than 6 months
of passaging postprocurement.
In vitro viral transduction
Lenti-miR-16 was a gift from Dr. Yinon Ben-Neriah
(Hebrew University, Jerusalem) and Lenti-miR-27a was
described elsewhere (18). HEK293 cells with pCMV-VSVG
and pHR82R packaging plasmids were used to produce the
lenti-miRs. OS cells at subconﬂuent density (70%) were
incubated with the lentivirus for 4 to 5 hours. Selection
with 0.5 mg/mL puromycin began the next day. Stable clones
were then isolated and veriﬁed by qRT-PCR and GFP
ﬂuorescence.
Cell proliferation analysis
Cells (1.5  103) were plated in 96-well plate and analyzed by
a 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-S-sulfophenynl]H-tetrazolium-5
carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) proliferation assay according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Colony formation assay
Cells were plated at a density of 500 cells per well in a 6-well
plate in triplicate. After 1 to 2 weeks, the cells were ﬁxed with
70% ethanol, stained with Giemsa and counted.
Matrigel invasion assay
Blind well chemotaxis chambers with 13 mm diameter ﬁlters
were used for this assay. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate ﬁlters, 8-mm pore size (Costar Scientiﬁc Co.), were coated
with basement membrane Matrigel (25 mg/ﬁlter). Cells (2 
105) suspended in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the upper
chamber. Conditioned medium of NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts was
placed in the lower chamber. Assays were carried out at 37 C
in 5% CO2. More than 90% of the cells attached to the ﬁlter after
incubation for 7 hours. After incubation, the upper surface of
the ﬁlter was freed of cells with a cotton swab. Cells that passed
through the ﬁlter to bottom side were ﬁxed with methanol and
stained with Giemsa. Each triplicate assay was conducted
twice. Invasive cells were counted in 10 representative light
microscopy ﬁelds.
Mouse experiments
All animals were housed in the Hebrew University animal
facility and the experiments with live animals were approved
by our institute animal committee and conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines. HOS cells expressing miR-control, miR16, or miR-27a were injected s.c. (5  106 cells) or i.v.
(1  106 cells), respectively, into nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice. For SC
experiments, tumor volume was evaluated weekly and tumor
mass measured at the end of the experiment. For i.v.
experiments, 6 weeks after injecting cells expressing miR27a-GFP or control-miR-GFP, mice were sacriﬁced and lungs
as well as legs and forearms were examined for micro- and
macrometastases, respectively, using a ﬂuorescent stereomicroscope (Olympus).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was carried out on formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded specimens with the following antibodies:
polyclonal antiactive caspase-3 (Cell Signaling; dilution 1:100),
polyclonal anti-BCL2 (Abcam ab7973-1; dilution 1:100), and
polyclonal anti-NFAT5 (Abcam ab110995; dilution 1:100).
Detection was carried out by ABC kit (BA-1000, VECTOR
Laboratories) according to manufacturer's speciﬁcations.
Slides were reviewed in blinded fashion and ranked according
to density of immunostain. Five bone marrow core biopsy
controls were used, assessing immunostaining on trabecular
bone rimming osteoblasts.

Results
miRNA expression signature for osteosarcomagenesis
To identify differentially expressed miRNAs common in
osteosarcomagenesis, we compared miRNA expression proﬁles from 18 pretreatment biopsy samples from conventional (osteoblastic/ﬁbroblastic) OSs to control samples from
healthy bone tissue (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 34
miRNAs were signiﬁcantly deregulated (P < 0.01); of those, 11
had higher expression among the conventional OS group
and 23 lower expression (Table 1, Fig. 1A). The most upregulated miRNAs in OS were miR-181a and miR-181b. MiR29b, miR-451, and miR-16 were among the most downregulated. Discrimination by proﬁle between the 2 groups was
strong. The cross-validation receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curve from the Bayesian compound covariate predictor had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.986. This shows
an extremely strong capacity for the relative expression
levels of these 34 miRNAs to place a given sample into its
correct group, OS or control.
For validation, we conducted qRT-PCR for a subset of the
samples (Fig. 1B). Speciﬁcally, qRT-PCR conﬁrmed differential
expression for 9 of the 34 signiﬁcant OS (shown in Fig. 1A)
miRNAs among a random sampling of 7 specimens from OSs
and 4 from controls. In particular, we conﬁrmed the downregulation of miR-29b, miR-16, miR-142-5p, miR-26b, let7g, miR223, and miR-451 in OS samples as compared with controls. By
contrast, miR-181a and miR-181b showed signiﬁcant upregulation in OS cases (Fig. 1B). In addition, miR-29a, expressed from
the same locus as miR-29b, was checked by qRT-PCR as a
separate validation of the same locus. Other than 1 sample in
each of 2 of the qRT-PCR experiments, all OS samples and
control samples had distinct expression ranges, with no overlapping means.
Conventional, chondroblastic, and telangiectatic histologic
subtypes of OS have distinct pathologic features. To interrogate the potential contribution of miRNA expression to the
development of these different high-grade OS histologic subtypes, miRNA proﬁles from 18 conventional, 4 telangiectatic, 5
chondroblastic, 1 recurrent chondroblastic, 1 recurrent conventional, and 1 soft tissue OSs were subjected to unsupervised
hierarchical clustering. Conventional, telangiectatic, chondroblastic, and even soft tissue OSs all clustered together in
intermingled fashion (Fig. 1C). All 4 telangiectatic OSs clustered to 1 side of the highest hierarchy division, characterized

by elevated expression of miR-142-5p, miR-15a, miR-486-5p, and
miR-488. Small sample size makes statistical resolution of this
ﬁnding unfeasible. Both conventional and chondroblastic OSs

1868

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

clustered with those 4 telangiectatic OSs. The overall coclustering of different subtypes suggests that with regard to miRNA
expression, these tumors share more in common than not,
which suggests that the miRNA expression represents more a
shared oncogenic program than a differentiation proﬁle alone,
as these tumors are distinctly dissimilar in cell differentiation
state. miRNA proﬁling therefore may not be helpful in deﬁning
histologically based OS subtype classiﬁcations.
To validate against an alternate data set, the publicly available S-MED database (19) was queried for the 34 miRNAs
highlighted by our OS signature. The 15 OS samples (not
subtyped) and 6 control bone samples recorded in the S-MED
database had raw expression data for 26 of these miRNAs.
Expression of 17 corroborated the differential expression in our
samples (8 were signiﬁcant with Student t test P values ranging
from 0.006 to 5  108.) These statistically signiﬁcant and
concordant expression data included higher expression of
miR-181c and miR-190 in S-MED OS specimens and lower
expression of miR-16, miR-126 , miR-150, miR-195, miR-657,
and miR-340. Although the S-MED database includes fewer OS
specimens than our primary data and lacks any clinical or
pathologic annotation, it provides validation of the most
important members of our OS miRNA signature proﬁle from
an alternate sample source and proﬁling platform.
miR-181b is inversely correlated with miR-29b in OS
To conﬁrm deregulation of miRNA expression within tumor
cells speciﬁcally, in situ hybridization of probes antisense to the
differentially expressed miR-181b and 29b was carried out with
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections processed
from 9 of the same pretreatment biopsy specimens from which
fresh tissue for total RNA isolation had been initially banked. As
shown in Fig. 2, in situ hybridization with LNA-modiﬁed anti–
miR-181b (panel B) or anti-miR-29b (panel C) probes showed
results consistent with qRT-PCR (panel D). No signal was
detected with scrambled oligo showing probe speciﬁcity (data
not shown). Some tissues showed positive hybridization for the
downregulated miRNA-29b (Fig. 2D). Although downregulation
is not tantamount to absence, this nonetheless prompted
further investigation. Using double labeling for miR-29b and
miR-181b, it was conﬁrmed that expression did not colocalize
to the same cells (Fig. 2E, F), suggesting that the pro-osteoblast
differentiation miR-29b was speciﬁcally absent in cells with the
most robust oncogenic program of miR-181b expression. Additional in situ hybridization validation was carried out using a
bone cancer tissue microarray (US Biomax, Inc.) that included
8 core tissue sections from 4 OSs. Two of the OS specimens
showed strong staining for miR-181b and minimal miR-29b
staining (data not shown), further evidence for miRNAs that
may differentiate tumor versus normal bone.

included 1.75- and 4.53-fold increased expression of miR-181c
and miR-27a, respectively, in metastatic OSs. The class prediction analysis with these 2 miRNAs yielded a relatively strong
ROC curve with an AUC of 0.805, indicating that the expression
level of these 2 miRNAs alone discriminated between tumors
that would and would not develop clinical metastases.
As OS patients typically receive chemotherapy after biopsy,
but before resection, the percentage necrosis or treatment
effect noted by the pathologist in the resection specimen has

been found to be a powerful prognostic tool (20). All OS
patients with pretreatment sample miRNA proﬁles available

resection and histopathologic grading of necrosis (n ¼ 27,

between differentially expressed pretreatment miRNAs and

correlation, which measures the correlation of rank ordering
between 2 values, identiﬁed expression of 8 miRNAs positively

and 1 negatively correlated (Supplementary Table S2A; Fig. 3B
shows unsupervised clustering by Spearman-identiﬁed miRNAs). Pearson correlation, which identiﬁes linear relationships
rather than rankings, identiﬁed 7 miRNAs positively correlated
with necrosis at less than 0.01 stringency (Supplementary
Table S2B; Fig. 3C shows unsupervised clustering by Pearson-identiﬁed miRNAs). miR-451 and miR-15b, with the 2
highest Spearman correlation coefﬁcients of 0.64 and 0.619,
respectively, were also highlighted by the Pearson correlation
list, having correlation coefﬁcients of 0.533 and 0.539, respectively. Thus, increased expression of miR-15b (from the miR-15/
16 family) and miR-451 in pretreatment samples was the most
stringent predictor of good response to chemotherapy. RT-PCR
validated expression levels of miR-451 and miR-15b in a subset
of chemosensitive and chemoresistant OS samples (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Functional validation of miR-16 as tumor suppressive

To determine the functional relevance of miRNA deregulation in OS, we studied the effect of miR-16 and miR-27a

manipulation on OS cells. We ﬁrst checked the endogenous
miR-16 and miR-27a levels by qRT-PCR in 1 human osteoblast
and 6 human OS cell lines. Three OS cell lines (HOS, KHOS, and
U2OS) exhibited signiﬁcantly low levels of miR-16 as compared
with hOB (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, miR-27a expression levels were lower in these cells while the MG-63 cells,
capable of metastasis and the highly metastatic LM-7 cells
displayed higher levels (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we set to determine whether reintroduction of these
miRs affected the tumorigenic traits of OS cells (Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4). Using XTT test, we observed
signiﬁcant growth inhibition in U2OS and hOB cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast, we did not detect this effect
in HOS, KHOS, and SaOS2 cells (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig.
S5). Nevertheless, overexpression of miR-16 in OS cells displaying low levels of endogenous miR-16 was associated with
signiﬁcant reduction in colony formation ability (Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, HOS-expressing miR-16
displayed increased apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin (Fig. 4C).
We next evaluated the tumor suppressor function of miR-16
in vivo. HOS cells overexpressing control miR or miR-16 were

xenografted into the ﬂanks of NOD/SCID mice and monitored
for tumor formation. We found that overexpressing miR-16
produced tumors of smaller volume and smaller ﬁnal mass
(Fig. 4D–F). Furthermore, miR-16 overexpressing HOS xenografts exhibited increased activated caspase-3 staining (Fig.
4G), an indicator of enhanced apoptosis in the absence of
cytotoxic treatment.
To interrogate the impact of miR-27a overexpression on the
metastatic potential of OS cells, we infected HOS cells with a
lentiviral vector that expresses either miR-27a or control miR
along with a GFP reporter. In vitro, a wound healing assay
found increased migration with overexpression of miR-27a
versus control miR (Fig. 4H). Similarly, Matrigel invasion assay
showed that miR-27a increased invasiveness (Fig. 4I). miR-27a–
expressing cells were next injected i.v. into NOD/SCID mice to
evaluate the metastatic potential of these cells. Six weeks later,
the animals were scariﬁed and dissected to look for both
microscopic and macroscopic metastases. We found that
overexpression of miR-27a is associated with increased ability
to form metastatic foci compared with control miR. The
number and size of pulmonary metastases was signiﬁcantly
increased as well as the presence of macroscopic metastatic
disease in the bones of the legs and forearms (Fig. 4J–N).
Additional functional validation in other cell lines conﬁrmed
promigration and invasion effects of miR-27a (Supplementary

Predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs
reﬂected in OS
MiRNAs are known to have downregulatory effects at the
level of transcript longevity and translational control. Expression levels of TargetScan-predicted target genes of miR-16 were
found to be reduced in OS and osteoblast cell lines following
overexpression of miR-16 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, expression levels
of predicted target genes of miR-27a were found to be reduced
in OS cell lines following overexpression of miR-27a (Fig. 5B).
We expanded the analysis of expression of target genes by
proﬁling gene expression by Affymetrix array in 14 of the OS
samples in our cohort and 4 of the normal bone control
samples. Our data revealed differential changes in a signiﬁcant
number of genes (data not shown). The miRNA and mRNA
expression proﬁles were then integrated to identify functional
relationships that may contribute to OS. Instead of correlating
gene expression with all miRNAs, we focused on miRNAs in
which differential expression was most signiﬁcant in OS; miR16, miR-142-5p, miR-29b as downregulated miRNAs in OS and
miR-181 and miR-27a as upregulated miRNAs in OS. Positive
and negative correlations were found. However, we focused on
the differentially expressed genes that followed the directional
change predicted by the miRNA; increased expression in OS for
genes targeted by miR-16, miR-142-5p, and miR-29b and
decreased expression of genes targeted by miR-181 and miR27a (Supplementary Tables S3A and S3B). We found that

genes that are predicted targets and responsive in cell line
experiments (Fig. 5C). A linear regression trend line for each
series showed the predicted direction of correlation with
increasing level of miR-15b linked to decreasing levels of each
gene's mRNA.
Because miRNAs can have more profound effects on translation than transcription, we carried out immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from a subset of the OS samples. We
selected 2 genes, one a well-known gene in OS, BCL2, the other a
gene not previously associated with OS, but also a target of the
miR-15/16 family, NFAT5. For both, immunohistochemistry
conﬁrmed increased protein presence in the cohort OSs than
in the osteoblasts of bone marrow controls (Supplementary
Fig. S6). The BCL2 immunohistochemically stained sections
were blindly ranked from least to most positive for staining.
This ranking was then plotted against the expression level of
miR-15b (Fig. 5D) and against the expected clinical parameter
of percentage necrosis as measured from later resection surgery to quantify chemoresponsiveness (Fig. 5E). Linear regressions strongly followed the expected correlation in each.
Although these correlations only consider 1 example, they
suggest that the differentially expressed miRNAs play a direct
role in controlling transcript levels and translational success of
predicted target genes in OS.

Discussion
We report unique OS signatures of miRNA expression
related to the OS character and pathogenesis, to clinical
metastasis, and to chemotherapy response. The deregulation
of miR-181b speciﬁcally in the malignant cells in OS tissues by

1874

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

in situ hybridization provides a potential OS marker. Furthermore, miR-181b and miR-29b expression inversely correlate in
subpopulations of cells in the tumors. Signiﬁcantly, our in vitro
and in vivo functional experiments validate miR-16 as a tumor
suppressor and miR-27a as prometastatic in OS and osteoblast
cell lines. These data suggest potential targets for future
therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, our study indicates that
by correlating genome-wide gene and miRNA expression proﬁles, putative functional miRNA–mRNA interactions could be
identiﬁed in OS.
The conventional OS miRNA expression signature we
report here, showed strong statistical signiﬁcance even in
a relatively small sample size. This suggests proﬁle consistency across the samples. Given the genetic and cytogenetic
complexity inherent to OS (2), this consistency raises the
possibility that miRNAs play a central role in osteosarcomagenesis. That the miRNA proﬁle differed little even
among histologically disparate samples from chondroblastic
and telangiectatic OSs further suggests a role for these
miRNAs in development of OS generally. Validation against
another patient group conﬁrmed the differential expression
of the critical members of this (19). A ﬁnal validation of our
signature derives from our observation that some of the
prominent signature miRNAs are also highlighted by OS
metastasis and chemotherapy responsiveness signatures
(Supplementary Fig. S7).
As we qualitatively evaluate these signature OS miRNAs,
downregulated miRNAs are most striking. MiR-29b ﬁgured
prominently in this list. We also showed its localization to a
distinct cell subpopulation within the tumors. This ﬁts the

Osteosarcoma miRNAs

powerful role of miR-29b as a prodifferentiation miRNA in
normal osteoblasts (21). Other signature downregulated miRNAS have known prodifferentiation roles in other tissues, miR223 in myeloid (22) and miR-451 in erythroid differentiation
(23). miR-29b is also known as a tumor suppressor miRNA (24).
The tumor suppressor category also encompasses other prominently downregulated members of the signature proﬁle,
including miR-142-5p (25), miR-340 (26), breast cancer metastasis suppressing miR-335 (27), BCL-2 targeting miR-16/16-2
(reviewed in ref. 28), miR-126/126 (reviewed in ref. 29), and
miR-195 (30), an miR-15/16-related miRNA. Together with our
in vitro functional validation for miR-16, these ﬁndings highlight critical tumor suppressor functions of the miR-15/16
family in OS.
Most upregulated miRNAs in the OS signature are known as
oncomiRs, such as miR-190 (31), miR-10b [(32) and references
therein], miR-7 [(33) and references therein], miR-214 [(34) and
references therein], and miR-210 (35). Although miR-574-3p is
not well characterized in the literature, it is predicted to target
disabled homolog 2 interacting protein, which is silenced in a
number of cancers (36–38), retinoid X receptor alpha, which is
associated with vitamin D metabolism and polymorphismbased cancer risk (39), and FOS-like antigen 2 (Fosl2/Fra2),
which is a prodifferentiation gene in osteoblasts (40). Most
prominently, 3 of the 4 miRNAs from the miR-181 group were
highly upregulated in OS samples. miR-181 has been associated
with stemness and poor prognosis in other cancers [(41) and
references therein]. Furthermore, miR-181 activates Wnt signaling (42), important in OS pathogenesis (43). Together with
our in situ hybridization conﬁrmation that miR-181 identiﬁes a
subgroup of cells within OS tissues that lack miR-29b–driven
differentiation, these data highlight miR-181 as a critical OS
oncomiR.
Increased expression of miR-181c and miR-27a at pretreatment biopsy was found to be prognostic of metastatic disease.
This punctuates the importance of the miR-181 family to OS.
miR27a is a known oncomiR, associated with metastasis in
gastric cancer (44) and poor prognosis in ovarian carcinoma
(45). Our in vitro and in vivo experiments conﬁrmed that miR27a overexpression enhances migration, invasion, and proliferation in metastatic sites. These ﬁndings correlate with the
recently described inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by
miR-27a (18). Targeted therapies against miR-27a are emerging
(46, 47).
Expression levels of miR-451 and miR-15b in pretreatment
specimens both correlated positively with percentage necrosis following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Reduced expression of miR-451 was also prominent in the general OS
signature. Although miR-15b itself was not highlighted in
the general OS signature, miR-16, miR16-2 , and miR-195, all
from the same miR-15/16 family, were. Apparently, reduced
expression of these miRNAs characterizes OS generally, but
among OSs, further reduced expression correlates with
resistance to chemotherapy. MiR-15b and other family members target Bcl-2, which could explain their downregulation
in chemoresistant tumors (48). We conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry the increased presence of BCL-2 in the OS
histologic specimens compared with controls. Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

increased apoptosis was identiﬁed both in untreated xenografts and doxorubicin-treated cultures of OS cells driven to
overexpress miR-16. Our ﬁndings did not corroborate any of
the speciﬁc miRNAs reported to predict chemotherapeutic
response in a series of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded OS
specimens (10). This other study differed in source and
method of RNA isolation. It also focused on ifosfamide, an
infrequent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for OS in the United
States and received by only one of our patients. Furthermore,
our ﬁndings did not highlight any of the previously investigated individual miRNAs noted to have roles in OS cell
lines (6–9).
The profound effects of miR-16, miR-142-5p, miR-29b, miR181, and miR-27a on the microarray-deﬁned expression of their
predicted target genes, with statistically signiﬁcant differences
in the predicted direction, suggest that these miRNAs play
central roles in deﬁning the expression identity of OS. Our
study reveals many potential functional miRNA–mRNA relationships that will need to be further explored mechanistically
for their involvement in OS pathogenesis. Gain and loss of
function studies are needed to investigate further the role of
these miRNAs that have correlated with transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle control, and known cancer signaling pathways. Finally, the discovery of previously unidentiﬁed functional relationships may lead to the development of novel
therapeutic approaches. Further investigation into the potentially more poignant effects on translation of their targets may
yield additional insights into this newly recognized method of
an OS cell deﬁning itself.
Making clear sense of how the genetic chaos that deﬁnes OS
derives such a patterned clinical disease remains a distant
goal, but these data strongly recommend the pursuit of
osteosarcomiRs and silenced OS tumor suppressor miRNAs
as critically associated with development of OS. The statistical
strength of the OS signature we report, the consistency across
multiple histologic subtypes, and especially the overlap of the
general OS signature with signatures predictive of metastasis
and predictive of response to chemotherapy, all highlight the
central role of these dysregulated miRNAs in osteosarcomagenesis. Our validation studies for key signature OS miRNAs
and integration of miRNA expression with mRNA expression,
together with existing literature provide models for future
study.
