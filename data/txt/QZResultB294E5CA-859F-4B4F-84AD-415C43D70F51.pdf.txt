Abstract
HuR (ELAV1), an RNA-binding protein abundant in cancer cells, primarily resides in the nucleus, but under
speciﬁc stress (e.g., gemcitabine), HuR translocates to the cytoplasm in which it tightly modulates the expression
of mRNA survival cargo. Here, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that stressing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA) cells by treatment with DNA-damaging anticancer agents (mitomycin C, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin,
and a PARP inhibitor) results in HuR's translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Importantly, silencing
HuR in PDA cells sensitized the cells to these agents, whereas overexpressing HuR caused resistance. HuR's role in
the efﬁcacy of DNA-damaging agents in PDA cells was, in part, attributed to the acute upregulation of WEE1 by
HuR. WEE1, a mitotic inhibitor kinase, regulates the DNA damage repair pathway, and therapeutic inhibition of
WEE1 in combination with chemotherapy is currently in early phase trials for the treatment of cancer. We validate
WEE1 as a HuR target in vitro and in vivo by demonstrating (i) direct binding of HuR to WEE10 s mRNA (a discrete
56-bp region residing in the 30 untranslated region) and (ii) HuR siRNA silencing and overexpression directly
affects the protein levels of WEE1, especially after DNA damage. HuR's positive regulation of WEE1 increases
g-H2AX levels, induces Cdk1 phosphorylation, and promotes cell-cycle arrest at the G2–M transition. We
describe a novel mechanism that PDA cells use to protect against DNA damage in which HuR posttranscriptionally regulates the expression and downstream function of WEE1 upon exposure to DNA-damaging
agents. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1128–40. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Despite high-throughput sequencing of human pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) genomes (1), effective targeted
therapies remain elusive. A recent phase III trial reported (2)
that a combination of three DNA-damaging agents (5-ﬂuorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; FOLFIRINOX) resulted in an
improvement in response from 9.4% to 31.6% (P < 0.001).
Despite this signiﬁcant progress, virtually all patients with
PDA acquire resistance to DNA damaging–based chemotherapies. Because all of the cytotoxic agents used to treat PDA,
including the components of FOLFIRINOX, work through DNA

damage, there is an urgent need to better understand how PDA
cells respond to cytotoxic stress and develop either acute or
acquired drug resistance.
Prior work reveals that cell-cycle checkpoints enable cells to
undergo DNA repair in response to DNA damage (3, 4); and
defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) can lead to cancer
(3). The DDR network encompasses several signaling pathways
(3, 5) that ultimately recruit a cascade of proteins to the site of
DNA damage. In normal cells, damaged DNA is typically
repaired during the G1–S checkpoint (6, 7). In contrast, most
cancer cells, including PDA cells, have defects in the G1–S
checkpoint mainly due to genetic inactivation of TP53; therefore, in many instances, cancer cells depend on the G2–M
checkpoint to repair damaged DNA (6–8). The G2–M checkpoint depends predominantly on posttranslational modiﬁcation of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1, also known as CDC2)
by WEE1, a tyrosine kinase; and CDC25, a tyrosine phosphatase. WEE1 and Myt1 phosphorylate CDK1 at tyrosine-15 (Y15)
and threonine-14 (T14), causing G2–M arrest during DNA
replication (9–13). These molecular events provide a checkpoint for DNA repair to occur before cells progress into mitosis
(14, 15).
Previously, WEE10 s activity has been shown to be downregulated via proteasome-dependent degradation through
phosphorylation by polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1; ref. 13). WEE1
activity is also reduced through ubiquitin-mediated

degradation by ubiquitin ligase SKP1/Cul1/F-box protein
(SCF) complex, b-TrCP, and Tome-1 (16–18). In addition,
WEE10 s activation domain is responsible for its degradation
through phosphorylation on Ser-472 (19). More recently, it
was shown that CDC14A takes part in WEE1 degradation
through CDK-mediated phosphorylation of WEE1 on Ser-123
and Ser-139 (20). These multiple independent posttranslational modiﬁcations function to inhibit WEE10 s kinase activity during the entry into mitosis.
The importance of WEE1 as a regulator of the G2–M
checkpoint in cancer cells has been demonstrated. WEE1 has
been found to be highly expressed in various cancer types and
is thought to play a role in transformation (15, 21) as well as
resistance to DNA-damaging agents (22–24). In fact, inhibition
of WEE1 by siRNA silencing or a small molecule inhibitor
(MK-1775) in preclinical models abrogates the G2–M cell-cycle
arrest and drive cells into mitosis without successful DNA
repair, resulting in reduced tumor growth (25–27). These
ﬁndings are the basis for combining WEE1 inhibitors with
chemotherapeutic agents as a potential therapeutic strategy
(23, 24, 28). However, many questions remain unanswered such
as (i) whether WEE1 expression levels remain stable in
response to DNA damage? and (ii) what is the underlying
mechanism that may govern WEE1 expression levels upon or
during DNA damage?
A candidate mechanism of WEE1 regulation in response to
DNA damage is posttranscriptional gene regulation. A key RNAbinding protein in cancer, HuR, a member of the embryonic
lethal abnormal vision 1 (ELAV1) family, is primarily localized
to the nucleus (29). HuR binds to its target mRNAs that contain
AU- or U-rich (ARE) elements in their 30 untranslated region
(UTR; ref. 30), and translocates to the cytoplasm upon speciﬁc
stress and posttranscriptionally regulates speciﬁc mRNAs.
Through this action, HuR affects several signaling pathways
including cell-cycle dynamics and cancer cell metabolism (31–
33). In fact, we demonstrated that HuR affects response to
different anticancer therapeutics such as a Death Receptor 5
agonist and gemcitabine through the regulation of speciﬁc
mRNA targets (31, 32). Thus, we expanded our survey of anticancer agents and hypothesized that similarly HuR could regulate the efﬁciency of DNA-damage anticancer agents. Insights
gained from this work have direct implications for optimizing
ﬁrst-line treatment (i.e., FOLFIRINOX) of patients with PDA.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MiaPaCa2, PL5, and Panc1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco/Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Gibco/Invitrogen), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco/Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 C
in 5% humidiﬁed CO2 incubators. Transient transfections were

Cytoplasmic, nuclear, and whole cell extracts
Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were isolated using the
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (ThermoScientiﬁc) as previously described (31). Whole cell lysates
were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce; ThermoScientiﬁc) as previously described (31).
Western blotting
Samples were mixed 1:1 with 2 Laemmli buffer and boiled
for 5 minutes. Approximately 10 to 50 mg of protein was
separated as previously described (32). The membrane was
blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with
HuR (3A2, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology), g-H2AX (1:1,000; Millipore), pCDK1-Y15 (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling Technology), CDK1 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling

density on coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with
mitomycin C (MMC), ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10
minutes in the dark at room temperature, and permeabilized
with 0.3% Triton-X for 30 minutes at 37 C. Cells were incubated
with g-H2AX antibody (Millipore) for 1 hour at 37 C followed
by Alexa Fluor 488 F anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 hour
in the dark at room temperature. The nuclei were stained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) and
mounted for analysis with a Zeiss LSM-510 Confocal Laser

counting the number of foci using the ImageJ 1.47a software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were seeded at 106 cell density in T-75 ﬂasks and
treated with MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2 hours, washed 3 times
with PBS, replenished with fresh complete media, and incubated for 24 hours. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Amersham)
was added to actively growing cells for 1 hour and cells were
ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 hours. Cells were denatured

Time-lapse video microscopy
MiaPaCa2 cells stably expressing GFP:histone H2B were
seeded in 6 cm dishes and 48 hours after transfection, cells
were treated with MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2 hours. MMC was
removed by washing cells 3 times with PBS, followed by
replenishment with complete media. Cells were then supplemented with HEPES (25 mmol/L), layered with mineral oil
(Sigma), and placed into a housing chamber that maintained
the temperature at 37 C. Using a Nikon TE2000 microscope
(Nikon) controlled by the MetaMorph software (Molecular
Devices), bright ﬁeld and ﬂuorescent images were captured
every 5 minutes for up to 48 hours. Individual movies were
manually analyzed using the MetaMorph software (Molecular
Devices) and approximately 100 cells per sample were
assessed for the indicated measurements. Visible chromosome condensation was used to score mitotic cells, with
telophase chromosomes marking the end of mitosis. Chromosome fragmentation was used to score apoptotic cells.
Selected frames representing different cell morphologies are
presented as montages.

Luciferase assay
PCR products corresponding to the 56-bp of WEE1 30 UTR
and mutations in the 56-bp of WEE1 30 UTR region were
puriﬁed and cloned into Promega psiCHECK2 luciferase
vector (Promega). MiaPaCa2 cells were transfected with these
plasmids in 6-well plates. After 48 hours of transfections, cells
were treated and luciferase activity was measured with a
luciferase assay report kit (Promega) as previously described
(32). For double transfections, cells were ﬁrst transfected with
siRNA HuR or control and 24 hours later transfected with
luciferase constructs.

Results

Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assays
MiaPaCa2 cells were plated at 30% to 50% conﬂuency in T150 ﬂasks and treated with gemcitabine (1 mmol/L) for 12
hours or MMC (150 nmol/L) for 16 hours. Immunoprecipitation was performed using either anti-HuR or immunoglobulin
G (IgG) control antibodies as described previously (31). RNA
was isolated from the immunoprecipitation, and WEE1 mRNA
binding was validated via reverse transcriptase quantitative
PCR (RT-qPCR).

DNA-damaging agents induce HuR translocation
MiaPaCa2 cells were stressed with predetermined IC50 doses
(Supplementary Table S1) of chemotherapies for 12 hours:
MMC, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin, PARP inhibitor (ABT888), and the positive control gemcitabine (31). First, an
immunoﬂuorescence assay validated that HuR was primarily
localized to the nucleus in untreated cells whereas HuR was
predominantly cytoplasmic after treatment (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting demonstrated a high abundance of cytoplasmic
HuR in all treated lysates (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1D),
whereas HuR expression in whole cell and nuclear lysates did
not signiﬁcantly change (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Speciﬁcally, cytoplasmic HuR levels increased after 4 hours in
MiaPaCa2 cells treated with MMC compared with untreated
cells. Peak enhanced cytoplasmic HuR levels occurred 16 hours
after treatment and decreased back to baseline levels 48 hours
after treatment (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1E). Panc1
and PL5 cells demonstrated enhanced cytoplasmic HuR levels
at 24 hours after MMC treatment and then a decline in
cytoplasmic HuR levels after 36 hours (Supplementary Fig.
S1F). Similarly, enhanced cytoplasmic HuR accumulation was
detected in MiaPaCa2 cells after 2 hours of oxaliplatin treatment (1 mmol/L), peaking after 8 hours and decreasing back to
baseline after 36 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1C). For MiaPaCa2, PL5, and Panc1 cells, HuR protein expression in whole
cell and nuclear lysates did not signiﬁcantly change between
cells treated with MMC or oxaliplatin as compared with the
untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S1B, S1C, and S1F),
indicating that these compounds enhance HuR translocation
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

In vivo ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay
Mouse studies were conducted at Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-accredited Thomas Jefferson University, and all study protocols were approved by
IACUC (Protocol Number 832B). MiaPaCa2 cells were
injected at 5 million cells s.c. (n ¼ 16) and allowed to grow
for 4 weeks. Mice were treated once intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with gemcitabine (1 mg/kg) for 12 hours and euthanized.
Tumors were harvested and lysed using digitonin-based
buffer (see above). Immunoprecipitation was performed

agents tested (MMC, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin, and
ABT-888), HuR-silenced MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells showed
reduced cell survival compared with control cells (Fig. 2B,
Supplementary Fig. S2A, S2D, and S2F). Accordingly, HuRoverexpressing cells showed increased resistance against
these DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Fig.
S2B, S2E, and S2G).
Long-term cell survival assay. We focused on understanding the efﬁcacy of MMC, a potent DNA crosslinker that
causes severe DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 34). To
further characterize the impact of HuR on MMC efﬁcacy, we
observed colony formation for 3 weeks in MiaPaCa2 cells. The
number of colonies formed in control and HuR-silenced cells
upon MMC treatment was not dramatically different (Fig. 2D
and E). In contrast, when HuR was overexpressed, MMC failed
to reduce the number of colonies, indicating that cells became
resistant to MMC treatment (Fig. 2D and E). In addition, we
observed differences in the microscopic appearance of colonies after MMC treatment depending on whether HuR was
silenced or overexpressed. Speciﬁcally, colony size of cells
treated with MMC in HuR-silenced and control conditions
was reduced, whereas HuR overexpressing cells maintained
colony size as compared with the controls (Fig. 2D).
Apoptosis analysis. Apoptosis signiﬁcantly increased
with MMC treatment in HuR-silenced cells, from 10% to
20%. In contrast, no dramatic increase was observed in the
siRNA control cells. Consistent with cell survival assays
above, HuR overexpression seemed to protect cells from
apoptosis with MMC treatment (Fig. 2F). These results
indicate that HuR expression plays a critical role in modulating PDA cell response to MMC treatment.

HuR silencing enhances DNA damage breaks in PDA cells
Because HuR levels directly affected chemotherapeutic
efﬁcacy, we next investigated HuR's role in the DDR upon
MMC exposure. Control and HuR-silenced cells were treated
with variable doses of MMC for 6 hours. This time point was
selected based on the determined time-course of HuR translocation and its predicted time of affecting the downstream
events related to the DDR (Fig. 1C). Histone H2AX phosphorylation at serine-139 (also known as g-H2AX) is an
established marker of DSBs (35). Under no treatment, immunoﬂuorescence assay detected some baseline background
g-H2AX foci formation in both control and HuR-silenced
cells (Fig. 3A and B). MMC treatment increased g-H2AX foci
in both control and HuR-silenced cells, indicating that MMC
treatment induced DNA damage (Fig. 3A and B). However,
HuR-silenced cells treated with MMC (150 nmol/L) had
dramatically increased g-H2AX foci formation compared
with control cells demonstrating that DNA damage persisted
and DNA repair was considerably delayed in the absence of
HuR (Fig. 3A and B).
Manipulation of HuR levels modulates the DDR
We next assessed whether HuR plays a role in DNA repair.
MiaPaCa2 and PL5 cells (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S3A)
transfected with control or HuR siRNA were treated with
MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2 hours. This dose was chosen based
on a predetermined IC50 value enough to induce DNA damage without causing signiﬁcant cell death (Fig. 2B). After 2
hours of MMC treatment, cells were washed to remove MMC
and replenished with fresh complete media and allowed to
repair DNA. The immunoﬂuorescence assay revealed that

MMC treatment induced g-H2AX foci in both control and
HuR-silenced cells after 2 hours of MMC treatment and 0

breaks (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Remarkably, 6 hours after washing MMC, the number of g-H2AX foci
increased signiﬁcantly in HuR-silenced cells compared with
the control (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
These ﬁndings suggest that DNA damage persisted and DNA
repair was considerably delayed in the absence of HuR.
Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates validated this ﬁnding, demonstrating that HuR status affects H2AX phosphorylation following MMC treatment (Fig. 3E and Supplemen-

g-H2AX foci formation and phosphorylation following MMC
treatment (Fig. 3F and G and Supplementary Fig. S3C). These
data suggest that HuR silencing enhances MMC efﬁcacy in
PDA cells. Because total H2AX levels were affected upon
MMC treatment (data not shown), we evaluated the possibility that HuR silencing combined with MMC treatment
might directly affect protein expression. We performed
RT-qPCR on HuR-bound mRNA [from ribonucleoprotein
immunoprecipitation (RNP-IP)] and did not observe any
signiﬁcant binding of HuR to H2AX mRNA (Supplementary

percentage of cells in the G2–M phase, after 24 hours, in
control-treated cells as compared with untreated control or

and MMC treatment on cell-cycle dynamics, we performed

with MMC reduced the number of cells to enter mitosis.
However, in HuR-silenced cells, the effect of MMC in causing
reduced cell-cycle progression was augmented (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Movies S1–S3). Quantiﬁcation of time-lapse

mitosis approximately 15 hours after treatment, whereas
HuR siRNA–treated cells entered into mitosis 2 hours earlier
than control cells. However, HuR siRNA- and MMC-treated
cells either died in mitosis or exited later than control cells
(Fig. 4F, siRNA control greater than 17 hours and siRNA HuR
greater than 24 hours). Moreover, the ﬁdelity of the mitoses
in HuR-silenced cells was greatly impaired, resulting in the
increase (approximately 3-fold) of polyploid cells (Fig. 4D
and E and Supplementary Movies S1–S3), suggesting that
they undergo mitotic catastrophe in the absence of HuR
expression. These results are consistent with the notion that
HuR silencing increases the cytotoxic effect of MMC in PDA
cells and forces cells to enter mitosis without adequate DNA
repair.
WEE1, a mitotic inhibitor, is a novel HuR target
To ﬁnd novel HuR targets in the cell-cycle and DDR pathways, we performed RNP-IP assay (31) in MiaPaCa2 cells using
an antibody against HuR. HuR-bound mRNA transcripts were
isolated and identiﬁed by sequencing analysis (E.R. Londin,
I. Rigoutsos, J.R. Brody, unpublished data). Concurrently, we
performed a genome-wide siRNA screen under low-dose gemcitabine therapy to identify genes whose silencing sensitized

MiaPaCa2 cells to DNA damage (V. Bhattacharjee, T.J. Yen, J.R.
Brody, unpublished data). Data from these two screening
strategies were integrated and WEE1 was identiﬁed as a novel
HuR target in the DDR pathway.
Validation that WEE1 is a bona ﬁde HuR target upon
chemotherapeutic stress
We next performed an RNP-IP assay in the presence or
absence of chemotherapeutic stress to validate the association of the HuR protein with endogenous WEE1 mRNA.
MiaPaCa2 cells were stressed with gemcitabine (1 mmol/L)
for 12 hours and MMC (150 nmol/L) for 16 hours. An RNP-IP
with a HuR antibody was performed to test the binding of
HuR with WEE1 (IgG RNP-IP was performed as a negative
control; Fig. 5A–C). The WEE1 expression was enriched by
80-fold upon gemcitabine treatment and 23-fold upon MMC
treatment in the HuR-IP, compared with an IgG control-IP
(Fig. 5C). As a positive control, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)
mRNA (a known HuR target; ref. 31) was enriched by 13-fold
upon MMC stress and 63-fold upon gemcitabine stress, (Fig.
5C). In addition, we conﬁrmed the binding of HuR with
WEE1 under another established HuR stressor, tamoxifen
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B; ref. 37). These results

indicate that WEE1 is a bona ﬁde HuR target. We further
veriﬁed WEE1 expression levels upon HuR manipulation.
HuR silencing resulted in signiﬁcant downregulation of
WEE1 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5D and E).
Accordingly, overexpressing HuR increased WEE1 levels,
indicating that HuR regulates WEE1 expression (Fig. 5E).
WEE1 is posttranscriptionally regulated by HuR upon
DNA damage
HuR typically regulates target protein expression by either
affecting RNA stability or facilitating protein translation (38).
To investigate whether HuR regulates WEE1 through mRNA
stability or protein translation upon DNA damage, we treated
cells 48 hours after transfection with MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2
hours and analyzed mRNA half-life after actinomycin D treatment, which inhibits transcription. As a control, mRNA stability of H2AX and GAPDH (both are not HuR targets) was also
analyzed. In control-treated cells, WEE1 mRNA levels degraded
with a half-life of approximately 3.5 hours. In contrast, WEE1
mRNA in HuR-silenced MMC-treated cells degraded at a faster
rate, with an estimated half-life of 1.8 hours (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). These data demonstrate that HuR
enhances WEE1 mRNA stability. WEE1 protein levels in MiaPaCa2 cells increased signiﬁcantly after 4 hours of MMC
treatment, corresponding with the time when HuR becomes
cytoplasmic (Fig. 1C), and dramatically reduced after 12 hours
(Fig. 6B). WEE1 expression levels upon MMC treatment in
Panc1 cells also increased after 2 hours and reduced after 36
hours (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Similarly, in PL5 cells, this
pattern persisted with WEE1 levels increasing after 2 hours of
treatment before returning below baseline after 36 hours

(Supplementary Fig. S5C). Similar patterns of WEE1 protein
expression were observed when MiaPaCa2 cells were treated
with oxaliplatin (1 mmol/L) and gemcitabine (1 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S5D and S5E). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that HuR stabilizes WEE1 mRNA and
posttranscriptionally regulates WEE1 upon DNA damage
insult.
Functional implications of HuR's regulation of WEE1
WEE1 affects downstream cell-cycle regulators (e.g., CDK1),
resulting in cell-cycle arrest (10, 12). To determine the impact
of HuR inhibition on MMC-induced DNA damage and cellcycle regulation, we evaluated protein expression of WEE1 and
phosphorylated CDK1 in MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells. Following
transfection with siRNA HuR or control oligos, cells were
exposed to MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2 hours, washed, and
replenished with complete media to allow for DNA repair over
24 hours. Consistent with prior experiments (Fig. 5E), HuR
silencing reduced WEE1 expression in both MiaPaCa2 (Fig.
6C and Supplementary Fig. S5H) and Panc1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5F). Further, HuR silencing also resulted in the
reduced phosphorylation of CDK1, a key cell-cycle regulator
at the G2–M phase (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S5F),
particularly under untreated conditions. Accordingly, HuR
overexpression also resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of
CDK1 (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S5G and Fig. S5I) in
both untreated and MMC-treated samples, providing mechanistic evidence of the G2–M arrest upon MMC treatment
(Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S5G). Moreover, reduced
phosphorylation of H2AX (i.e., decreased DSBs) was observed in HuR overexpressed lysates, further demonstrating

WEE1 Is Regulated by HuR upon DNA Damage

CR, coding region; UTR, untranslated region. B, schematic of the constructs used for transfection studies (left). WEE1–30 UTR (56 bp) sequences
are cloned into pCHECK2 luciferase vector. A plasmid without WEE1–30 UTR (56 bp) sequence (EV, empty vector) was used as a control. CAG-driven
promoter construct was used to normalize the luciferase activity. All three plasmids were transfected into MiaPaCa2 cells treated with MMC
(150 nmol/L) for 2 hours before luciferase activity was measured (right). Error bars, SD between three replicates. C, HuR binding to WEE1–30 UTR
(56 bp) mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR using a luciferase probe. D, RNP-IP analysis of mouse xenograft treated with i.p. gemcitabine

RT-qPCR. E, schematic of HuR's role in the DDR pathway and a novel mechanism of drug resistance to common cytotoxic therapies. Chemotherapy
results in the activation of HuR (i.e., HuR translocates to the cytoplasm from the nucleus) and subsequent stabilization of the WEE1 transcript,
thereby causing cell-cycle arrest in the G2–M phase and avoiding cell death.

HuR's effects on the efﬁcacy of MMC and the DDR (Fig. 3G).
These data demonstrate that HuR can mediate the DNA
damage response via posttranscriptionally regulating WEE1,
which leads to the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and
G2–M cell-cycle arrest (Figs. 5 and 6; Supplementary Figs. S4
and S5).
HuR binds to the WEE1 mRNA via 30 UTR
To determine the molecular interaction between HuR and
WEE1 mRNA, we identiﬁed HuR binding sites in the 30 UTR of
WEE1 by analyzing publicly available HuR crosslinking and
immunoprecipitation (CLIP) datasets (39–41). The WEE1 transcript contains a HuR binding site in its 30 UTR (Fig. 7A). To
independently conﬁrm the binding site in our context, the 56bp putative HuR binding site sequence was subcloned into a
luciferase expression construct and transfected into MiaPaCa2
cells (Fig. 7B; left; refs. 31, 32). A construct with CAG promoter
that ubiquitously drives luciferase was used as a positive
control (Fig. 7B; left). After 48 hours of transfection, cells were
treated with MMC (150 nmol/L) for 2 hours and luciferase
activity was measured. Results showed increased luciferase
activity in 30 UTR (56 bp) construct compared with the empty

www.aacrjournals.org

vector, providing support that HuR regulates WEE1 expression
through this binding site (Fig. 7B; right). Moreover, these data
prove that target protein expression and function are induced
by stressors (e.g., MMC) that activate HuR. In addition, cells
transfected with the constructs were also treated with
gemcitabine (1 mmol/L) and oxaliplatin (1 mmol/L) for 2
hours and results showed more than 2-fold increase in the
luciferase activity, suggesting that HuR's regulation of WEE1
through 30 UTR is not entirely stress dependent (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
To validate that the 56-bp binding sequence directly binds to
HuR, an RNP-IP assay with a HuR antibody and IgG as a
negative control was performed. After 48 hours, MiaPaCa2 cells
that were transfected with WEE1–30 UTR (56 bp) construct are
treated with MMC (150 nmol/L) for 16 hours. RT-qPCR analysis
with a luciferase probe showed more than 31-fold increase
upon MMC treatment, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of HuR
binding to 56-bp region in WEE1 30 UTR (Fig. 7C). We next
cotransfected the MiaPaCa2 cells with WEE1–30 UTR (56 bp)
construct and siHuR along with appropriate controls. After
48 hours of transfection, cells were treated with MMC (150
nmol/L), gemcitabine (1 mmol/L), and oxaliplatin (1 mmol/L)

for 2 hours. Results showed a signiﬁcant decrease in luciferase
activity when HuR was silenced, demonstrating the dependence on HuR for regulation of this construct (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). We further validated the binding of HuR to the 56-bp
site by creating two deletion constructs in the WEE1–30 UTR
(56 bp) construct. The ﬁrst deletional construct contains
the ﬁrst half, whereas the second construct contains the cterminal end of the 56-bp sequence. The luciferase activity
was signiﬁcantly decreased in the deletion constructs, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity and the importance of the entire 56-bp
binding sequence of WEE1 regulation by HuR (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
WEE1 mRNA binds to HuR in vivo
We validated in vivo HuR regulation of WEE1 in a mouse
PDA xenograft model. MiaPaCa2 PDA cells were injected
into a mouse (i.e., xenografted) and treated with i.p. gemcitabine (1 mg/kg) for 12 hours. Tumors were harvested and
an RNP-IP assay with a HuR antibody and IgG as a negative
control was performed. RT-qPCR validated that WEE1
expression increased up to 5-fold and dCK mRNA (a known
HuR target) increased up to 15-fold upon gemcitabine
treatment compared with an IgG control-IP (Fig. 7D). These
results indicate that HuR regulates WEE1 under chemotherapeutic stress in vivo.

Discussion
In-depth understanding of WEE10 s regulation of cell-cycle
dynamics and related aspects of the DDR stems from work
performed by Nobel Prize winner Paul Nurse (42) and this
basic work has recently been translated to preclinical models. Previously, it has been shown that WEE1 levels are
balanced by its degradation and synthesis throughout the
cell cycle (i.e., on the onset of mitosis, WEE1 levels are low,
whereas during S and G2 phases, WEE1 levels increase;
ref. 12). WEE10 s degradation is achieved by several phospho-dependent mechanisms. In the current study, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that this cell-cycle checkpoint kinase
is also tightly regulated by RNA-binding protein HuR. Thus,
we provide evidence that posttranscriptional regulation of
WEE1 by HuR may be critical for PDA cell survival under
clinically relevant drug exposure. These ﬁndings are particularly intriguing in light of recent discoveries that have
shown that inhibition of WEE1 can sensitize various chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells, and hence this strategy is being tested preclinically and in the clinic (21,
22, 24, 26, 27, 43). Speciﬁcally, this strategy is being tested
with the WEE1 inhibitor, MK-1775, which has been shown to
sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents by disrupting
the G2–M arrest (44). In this study, we put forth a novel acute
checkpoint mechanism (which involves WEE1) by which
cells can arrest and potentially "outlast" any abrupt DNA
damage insult encountered (e.g., chemotherapy exposure).
This checkpoint mechanism, like most in the cell cycle, is
highly regulated. For example, building on previous work
(45), HuR's regulation of WEE1 can, in turn, inhibit CDK10 s
ability to keep HuR "inactive" in the nucleus (Fig. 7E).

1138

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

These ﬁndings open up new questions. First, we have not
addressed whether this mechanism is unique to cancer cells,
although it is of note that HuR levels are more abundant in
cancer cells than in normal cells (31, 46, 47) and cancer cells
most likely rely on WEE1 due to frequent inactivation of TP53
(48–50). Second, we need to determine the relevance of WEE1
regulation by HuR in other tumor types. Third, because HuR
translocates to the cytoplasm in response to various DNAdamaging agents, it will be important to determine the speciﬁc
phosphorylation site(s) implicated in the response to these
DNA-damaging agents. Such insights might lead to new therapeutic strategies (e.g., kinase inhibitors) against chemotherapy resistance. Finally, future studies will determine whether
this pathway is equally relevant for both acute and acquired
drug-resistance mechanisms.
HuR's regulation of WEE1 may be a survival mechanism by
PDA cells in the face of acute ﬂuctuations in the tumor
microenvironment (33), including chemotherapy exposure.
Thus, targeting the molecular interaction between HuR and
WEE1 represents a novel opportunity to enhance outcomes in
patients receiving the current "best available" treatments (e.g.,
FOLFIRINOX). Designing therapies that inactivate "moving
targets" such as HuR and its regulation of mRNAs such as
WEE1 may turn out to be more successful therapeutic strategies than the ongoing attempts of targeting genetic alterations in PDA cells. Speciﬁcally, this study along with others may
lead us to sequencing and targeting nonexonic areas (e.g., HuR
binding sites) of the genome in an effort to enhance current
treatment strategies.
