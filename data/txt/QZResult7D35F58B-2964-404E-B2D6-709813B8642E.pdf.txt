BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to compare predictive factors for
the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) either with (M1) or without (M2) metastases.
METHODS. A cohort of prostate cancer patients was identified from a medical oncology practice treated with ADT for presumed nonlocalized prostate cancer,
evaluated the efficacy of ADT using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) time to progression (TTP) and compared factors associated with TTP in M2 and M1
patients.

RESULTS. In this 553 patient cohort 51% were M2 and 49% M1. The median
TTP on ADT for the M2 group was 33.2 months, versus 15.9 months in the M1
group (P < .0001). In multivariate analyses, lower biopsy Gleason score (GS), the
absence of metastases, and lower serum PSA at ADT initiation all were associated
with the efficacy of ADT. The association between GS and TTP was confined to
M1 patients, whereas the association between PSA at ADT initiation and TTP
was confined to M2 patients. Use of ADT as part of local treatment was associated with a shortened TTP in both groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–1.91).

CONCLUSIONS. In this large, retrospective study of HSPC patients in a medical
oncology practice treated with ADT for nonlocalized prostate cancer, we found
factors predicting efficacy of this treatment differed based on whether metastases
were present at ADT initiation. The use of ADT as a part of local therapy was
associated with a significantly decreased TTP, regardless of metastatic disease status. Cancer 2008;112:1247–53.  2008 American Cancer Society.

A

ndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most effective systemic therapy for patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Almost uniformly, PSA drops substantially, and may
remain low or undetectable for years and even decades. The emergence of resistant disease (castration-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer) is almost inevitable, however, and heralded by
a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
The bulk of the trials evaluating ADT in prostate cancer have
been performed in patients with HSPC and clinical metastases.1–3
With the advent of serum PSA testing, ADT has been used earlier
(before the development of metastatic disease, or M2) because of
earlier recognition of disease recurrence, as well as its reliable

efficacy, moderate toxicity, and simplicity of use.
Outcomes in this patient population are poorly studied. There are no randomized trials of ADT in the rising PSA setting and no reports comparing factors
predictive of outcome on ADT between men with
M1 and M2.
We queried a longitudinal database of patients
treated at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) to
describe the outcome of ADT use in men with HSPC
with or without metastases at the time of ADT initiation (M1 and M2, respectively). Our interest was to
compare predictive factors in these 2 common clinical settings in order to determine average response
rates and predictors of response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database
This cohort was generated from the Prostate Clinical
Research Information System (CRIS) at DFCI. The
CRIS system consists of data-entry software, a central
data repository, collection of patient data including
comprehensive follow-up of all patients, and tightly
integrated security measures. This system has been
recently described.4 This protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board at the Dana Farber
Harvard Cancer Center. Data are stored in an Oracle
relational database (Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif ).
All patients seen at DFCI and Brigham and Women’s
Hospital with a diagnosis of prostate cancer are
approached to participate. The consent rate is 86%.
Patient Selection
We identified and included patients with prostate
cancer who had been treated with ADT (orchiectomy
or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH],
with or without an antiandrogen) for nonadjuvant
HSPC, had consented to provide information on the
CRIS protocol, and had blood collected for research
purposes. Patients were excluded if there were no
PSA data after ADT initiation or if there were systemic data problems on the quality control analysis.
Quality Control
Three doctors trained in genitourinary oncology
(M.P., R.W.R., and M.N.) reviewed the primary medical record on 9% of the cohort and independently
evaluated each of the variables studied. In all, 14
data points on 48 patients (a total of 672 data points)
were reviewed. Overall, the data from the database
were 91% concordant with the data generated from
this review.

Statistical Considerations
Patients were grouped according to whether or not
metastatic disease was present at the initiation of
ADT (M1 and M2, respectively). Patient and disease
characteristics were summarized as number (%) of
patients or median and range of values and compared
between M1 and M2 using chi-square and Wilcoxon
rank sum tests. The primary outcome variable was
time to progression (TTP) on ADT, defined as the duration of time from ADT initiation to the date of ADT
progression. To meet the endpoint of ADT progression, a patient needed to have 2 rises in PSA above a
nadir value while receiving ADT. These rises did not
need to be sequential, but the first rise needed to be
greater than the nadir PSA plus 0.02 ng/mL and the
second rise needed to be greater than the first rise.
Each rise needed to be separated by at least 1 week.
The date of progression was defined as the date of the
first rise. Among 30 patients the date of starting secondary hormonal therapy, without fulfillment of the
definition of ADT progression, was considered as date
of ADT progression. TTP was censored at the date of
last follow-up visit or PSA value among patients who
were progression-free, and at date of death among 18
patients who died before ADT progression.
The TTP distribution was estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method; median and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) of TTP were summarized. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the association of patient and disease characteristics (before
initiation of ADT) with TTP in univariable and in
multivariable analyses that focused on the interaction of the characteristic with metastatic disease status at ADT initiation. Subsequently, multivariable
modeling was undertaken using the step-down procedure to arrive at a parsimonious model to predict
TTP, considering main effects and interactions with
metastatic disease status. Hazard ratios (HRs), 95%
CIs, and Wald chi-square test P-values were reported
from the models. Continuous characteristics were
dichotomized at the median value within the cohort,
with the exception of PSA at diagnosis, which was
dichotomized at 20 ng/mL because of its known correlation with prostate cancer-specific survival.5 An
unknown category was used for any missing data to
include all patients in the analysis.
PSA doubling time (PSADT) postprimary therapy
was calculated as the natural logarithm of 2 divided
by the slope from a linear regression of the natural
log of PSA values over time (months). PSADT was
dichotomized at the cutpoint of 3 months because of
its known association with clinical outcome.6
The statistical analysis was performed using SAS
v. 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All P-values are 2-sided.

RESULTS
Study Cohort
In all, 595 patients who were on primary ADT and
had blood collected were identified; 41 patients were
excluded from further analysis because of lack of
PSA follow-up data and 1 patient was removed from
analysis after the quality review because of a systematic data problem. The cohort of 553 patients
included in this analysis was treated with ADT
between February 1988 and January 2006. Median
follow-up after ADT initiation was 5.1 years (range,
<1 month to 17 years).
Patient and Disease Characteristics
Overall, 270 patients (49%) had metastatic disease at
initiation of ADT (M1). Table 1 presents the characteristics of these patients categorized by whether or not

metastases were present at ADT initiation. Not unexpectedly, these 2 groups of patients differed substantially in several key aspects, including serum PSA at
diagnosis, Gleason score of 8 or greater at diagnosis,
prior local treatment, use of an antiandrogen, use of
intermittent ADT, PSA at ADT initiation, and duration
from diagnosis to ADT initiation (all P values for comparisons between the 2 groups for these variables <.05).
For the 87 (16%) patients who received ADT as part of
their local therapy, the median duration of ADT as part
of local therapy was 8 months (range, 0.5–83.2 months),
and the median duration between completing ADT as a
part of local therapy and beginning ADT for nonlocalized disease was 21.8 months (range, 0–127 months).

TTP on ADT
Median TTP after ADT initiation was 23.7 months
(95% CI, 19.2–28.0 months). Table 2 summarizes the

association between patient and disease characteristics
and TTP on ADT. Figure 1 summarizes the relation
between progression on ADT and use of ADT as part of
local therapy in the entire study population. Only the
association of biopsy Gleason score with TTP differed
significantly among M1 and M2 patients (P < .05 for
interaction); the other characteristics showed little or
no heterogeneity in their association with TTP
between the M1 and M2 groups (Fig. 2).

In multivariable analyses, statistically significant predictive factors for TTP were metastatic disease at ADT initiation, whether ADT was used as
part of prior local treatment, PSA at ADT initiation,
and Gleason score (P < .05). PSADT (due to small
numbers of patients with a calculated PSADT) and
PSA nadir on ADT (because it is a posttreatment
variable) were not included in the multivariate
analyses.

TTP for Gleason 8 or more (vs Gleason 6 or less) was
1.99 (95% CI, 1.25–3.17) in the M1 patients compared
with 1.07 (95% CI, 0.72–1.60) in the M2 population.
In contrast, the association of PSA at ADT initiation on TTP was stronger in M2 patients (interaction
effect: P 5 .10). In the M2 population, those patients
with PSA 16.3 ng/mL (median for group) at ADT
initiation had a significantly higher risk of TTP compared with those with PSA below 16.3 ng/mL
(HR 5 1.56, 95% CI, 1.08–2.25), whereas in patients
with M1 the association of PSA on TTP was not as
evident.
A history of ADT use with local therapy was also a
significant predictor of progression (P 5 .009), regardless of metastatic disease status. Patients who had
received adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormonal therapy
as part of local therapy had a higher risk of TTP on
ADT compared with patients who did not receive hormonal therapy (HR 5 1.45, 95% CI, 1.10–1.91).

and TTP also did not differ. A PSADT of 3 months or
greater was associated with a longer TTP on ADT
than for a PSADT of less than 3 months (median 33
months vs 12 months, respectively, P 5 .02), and the

association appeared stronger in the M1 as compared
with the M2 patients (P 5 .02 for interaction).

PSA Nadir on ADT
Forty-five percent of patients had nadir PSA values
below 0.2 ng/mL after initiation of ADT. More M2
than M1 patients attained PSA nadir below 0.2 ng/
mL (55% vs 43%, P < .01). Median TTP for patients
who attained PSA nadir below 0.2 ng/mL was longer
than for patients who did not (41 vs 13 months) and
the effect was apparent for both M2 and M1
patients (45 vs 16 months and 31 vs 11 months,
respectively).
Comment
The efficacy of ADT in HSPC has been evaluated in
randomized trials in a select few clinical situations—
metastatic disease, locally advanced disease without
local treatment, and lymph node-positive disease.1–3,7,8
Although no randomized study has formally evaluated ADT in the M2 setting, outcomes have been examined within the context of retrospective cohorts.9
To our knowledge, this report is the first to consider
ADT efficacy results throughout the spectrum of ADT
use in HSPC.
In this retrospective cohort of 553 HSPC patients
treated with ADT, the prior use of ADT as part of
local treatment (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) was a
significant predictor of patient outcome. To our
knowledge this finding has not been reported previously in studies of ADT alone, although it was
reported recently in a prospective study of ADT plus
chemotherapy.10 Although there are many confounders, driven by the finding that patients with more
aggressive local disease are more likely to receive
ADT as part of local treatment, we were intrigued by
the finding that this association remained in multivariate analysis taking into account other known
prognostic markers. The length of time an individual
cancer is sensitive to ADT may be biologically fixed,
regardless of when the ADT is given. Thus, the use of
a short course of ADT as part of local therapy, followed by ADT later in the course of disease for the
treatment of nonlocalized HSPC, could be viewed as
intermittent ADT with a long first ‘off’ period. This
conclusion is supported by European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 30891.8
This report confirms the well-described association between the biopsy Gleason score, the presence
of metastases, and the serum PSA at ADT initiation
and clinical outcome in both univariate and multivariate analyses. However, it is notable that the association between biopsy Gleason score and ADT TTP
was confined to M1 patients, and not noted in those

with M2. Interestingly, several studies have not
found an association between Gleason score and survival in the M1 population, but neither evaluated
the PSA TTP endpoint.11,12 We also recapitulated the
well-known association between both PSADT <3
months and PSA nadir on ADT of >0.02 ng/mL with
poor outcome.6,13,14
This report used a PSA TTP outcome measure to
evaluate ADT efficacy. Such a definition is not as
clinically relevant as prostate cancer-specific survival
or symptomatic outcomes such as pain from bone
metastases. Yet it has biologic relevance as the first
indication of the development of disease that is
growing in the castrate state. Moreover, the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer has clinically important sequelae for both the patient and the
treating physician, usually provoking a change in
therapy.
In the M1 population the TTP found in this
cohort (15.9 months) is shorter than that seen in the
Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) trial 8894,
which randomized M1 patients to orchiectomy with
or without an antiandrogen (median progression-free
survival of 18.6–20.4 months), which is not surprising
given the finding that SWOG-8894 used a radiographic definition of progression.15 The median TTP
on ADT in the M2 population of 33.2 months is
markedly lower than the TTP reported in other
cohorts.9,16 Several factors explain this difference,
including different endpoints (these studies use the
development of metastases as their efficacy endpoint, which can postdate PSA-based progression by
more than 2 years17) and the selection bias inherent
in a medical oncology-based cohort.5,14,16 In fact,
34.4% of our cohort had a Gleason score of 8 or
greater (much greater than the Gleason scores seen
in a large community urology cohort18) and 30% had
no local therapy.
This analysis has pitfalls. It is retrospective and
dependent on data (particularly PSA values) being
entered correctly into our longitudinal CRIS database. To counter these issues we performed a quality
control on 9% of the cohort and found it to be 91%
concordant in total. This analysis also draws on
patients in a wide variety of clinical scenarios and
treated using multiple different agents. Whereas this
heterogeneity adds considerable noise to our analysis, it does represent a scenario typical of an oncologic practice that specializes in prostate cancer.

Conclusion
In this large, retrospective study of prostate cancer
patients treated with ADT for nonlocalized HSPC, we

ADT in Advanced Prostate CA/Ross et al.

found that the use of ADT previously as a part of
local therapy was associated with significantly
shorted TTP on subsequent ADT, regardless of metastatic disease status. Moreover, factors predicting the
efficacy of this treatment differed based on whether
metastases were present at ADT initiation. For men
with M2, PSA at ADT initiation had predictive value,
whereas Gleason score did not, whereas for those
with M1 the reverse held true. This information can
be used to counsel patients on the potential efficacy
of ADT given their baseline characteristics and may
be important in identifying men with more aggressive disease for clinical trials.
