BACKGROUND: Although both radical cystectomy and intravesical immunotherapy are initial treatment
options for high-risk, T1, grade 3 (T1G3) bladder cancer, controversy regarding the optimal strategy persists. Because bladder cancer is the most expensive malignancy to treat per patient, decisions regarding
the optimal treatment strategy should consider costs. METHODS: A Markov Monte-Carlo cost-effectiveness
model was created to simulate the outcomes of a cohort of patients with incident, high-risk, T1G3 bladder
cancer. Treatment options included immediate cystectomy and conservative therapy with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The base case was a man aged 60 years. Parameter uncertainty was assessed
with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Scenario analyses were used to explore the 2 strategies among
patients stratified by age and comorbidity. RESULTS: The quality-adjusted survival with immediate cystectomy and BCG therapy was 9.46 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 9.39 QALYs, respectively. The corresponding mean per-patient discounted lifetime costs (in 2005 Canadian dollars) were $37,600 and
$42,400, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the probability that immediate cystectomy was cost-effective was 67%. Immediate cystectomy was the dominant (more effective
and less expensive) therapy for patients aged <60 years, whereas BCG therapy was dominant for
patients aged >75 years. With increasing comorbidity, BCG therapy was dominant at lower age thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BCG therapy, immediate radical cystectomy for average patients with
high-risk, T1G3 bladder cancer yielded better health outcomes and lower costs. Tailoring therapy based on
patient age and comorbidity may increase survival while yielding significant cost-savings for the healthcare

In North America, more than 60,000 cases of bladder

cancer are diagnosed every year. Approximately 75% of
patients have superficial (nonmuscle-invasive) disease at
first presentation.3 Such tumors carry a high risk of recurrence, mandating intensive follow-up. However, repeated
office visits, cystoscopic and cytologic monitoring, and
the treatment of recurrent lesions, often with intravesical
therapy, can be costly. Approximately 60% of the lifetime
cost affiliated with bladder cancer is attributable to tumor
surveillance.4 Because bladder cancer is the most expensive malignancy to treat on a case-by-case basis,5 it is
important to identify opportunities to reduce treatment
and surveillance costs while preserving survival and
quality of life.
The treatment of high-risk, high-grade, superficial
(T1, grade G3 [T1G3]) bladder cancer remains controversial.6 These cancers invade the lamina propria, frequently recur, and often progress to invade underlying
muscle, which is associated with decreased survival. The
risk of disease progression is particularly high if cancers
are multifocal or are associated with carcinoma in situ.
For such high-risk cancers, some surgeons advocate immediate radical cystectomy to maximize the chance of a
cure,7 whereas others have promoted conservative therapy with weekly intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) immunotherapy and delayed cystectomy if
indicated as an effective therapy with the potential for
bladder preservation.8 Although different studies have
supported the effectiveness of each regimen, to the best
of our knowledge, no study to date has assessed the
costs associated with the treatment of high-risk T1G3
bladder cancer.
In a previous analysis, we observed that the preferred
treatment option (assessing survival and quality of life but
not costs) between these 2 strategies depended on patient
characteristics, such as age and comorbidities, as well
as individual preferences.9 In the current analysis, we
updated our model to meet 2 additional objectives. First,
we analyzed the costs and cost-effectiveness of each strategy. Second, we explored whether additional research in
this area would be a wise investment of resources.

Overview
We compared 2 treatment strategies for the treatment of
potent man aged 60 years with a newly diagnosed, highrisk T1G3 carcinoma of the bladder: 1) immediate nervesparing radical cystectomy with creation of an orthotopic
ileal neobladder and 2) initial conservative therapy, which
consisted of intravesical BCG with possible delayed cystectomy. We described health effects in terms of life
expectancy with and without quality adjustment and calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 2
interventions, defined as the ratio of marginal costs to
marginal health effects (see the equation below).
We discounted both health effects and costs by 3%
per annum.10 Our perspective was that of a healthcare
payer because of the high direct costs incurred by health
payers for bladder cancer treatment.5 TreeAge modeling
software was used to build the model (TreeAge Software
Inc., Williamstown, Mass).

Model Structure and Validation
We built a Markov model in which the clinical course of a
hypothetical cohort of patients was described by discrete
health states and transitions between these states.11 The
model’s time horizon was the lifetime of the patients. The
details and structure of the original Markov model have
been described elsewhere.9 Briefly, patients in the hypothetical cohort who underwent immediate cystectomy
were subject to a risk of postoperative mortality (Fig. 1).
Those who survived surgery entered 1 of 8 mutually exclusive health states defined by distinct combinations of the 3
major long-term postcystectomy complications (sexual,
genitourinary, and gastrointestinal). Patients with lymph
node-positive disease were deemed eligible for adjuvant
platinum-based chemotherapy.12
Patients receiving initial intravescial management
received 6 weekly instillations of induction BCG followed
by 3 weekly maintenance instillations at 3 months, 6
months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30

received intravesical BCG were 81% and 90%, respectively. These values agree with estimates from published
bladder cancer studies.13,16-21

Assumptions

FIGURE 1. This is a simplified health state transition diagram
for the model. Patients in a hypothetical cohort who undergo
immediate cystectomy begin in the cystectomy health state
and then move into postcystectomy health states based on
the probabilities of developing long-term cystectomy complications (not shown). Patients who receive conservative therapy begin in the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Cycle 1
health state. The development of metastases or death from
other causes is possible from any health state.

We made several simplifying assumptions in the construction of the model. We did not explicitly model nonadherence during BCG therapy, because published effectiveness
values (ie, recurrence and progression rates) already
account for nonadherent patients. We also assumed that
all recurrences during BCG therapy would be detected at
surveillance cystoscopy. Finally, we did not account for
extremely rare complications, such as bladder contracture
(<0.1%) after BCG,22 because their inclusion would not
be likely to influence the model results.

Probabilities and Utilities
months after diagnosis according to the Southwest Oncology Group protocol.13 We used a cycle length of 6
months, which reflected the intervals when treatment
decisions are made for patients with bladder cancer. After
induction or maintenance BCG, patients were at risk
for disease progression or recurrence. For progression,
patients underwent radical cystectomy. Individuals with
recurrent T1G3 lesions received a second cycle of BCG
induction and maintenance. Those who experienced a
T1G3 recurrence either during or after the second cycle of
BCG therapy were deemed BCG failures and underwent
radical cystectomy. After a successful complete BCG cycle
(30 months), patients underwent annual cystoscopic and
cytologic surveillance to monitor for recurrence.
At any point in the model, regardless of treatment
strategy, patients could develop metastatic disease or
could die of unrelated causes based on age-specific mortality rates obtained from national life tables.14 We assumed
that all patients who presented with metastases were eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy15 and that the likelihood of developing metastatic disease was based on the
tumor’s local and lymph node stage.
The survival estimates of our model have been validated previously.9 Briefly, for patients who underwent
radical cystectomy, the 5-year overall and disease-specific
survival rates generated by the model were 80% and 91%,
respectively. The corresponding rates for patients who
5452

Probabilities were obtained from the published medical literature; where possible, probabilities from multiple studies
were pooled using the inverse variance method (Table 1).
We assumed that transition probabilities (probabilities of
moving from 1 health state to another) occurred at a constant rate. Such rates, expressed as the number of events per
unit of time, are positive, continuous, and not limited by an
upper bound. Accordingly, we used a gamma distribution
to describe these rates and calculated the distribution parameters using the method of moments.23 We pooled and
described transition rates in the model accordingly. Similarly, we used a beta distribution to pool and describe the
probabilities of 1-time events.
Utilities are quality-of-life weights attached to each
model health state. Utilities are anchored at 0 (death) and 1
(best possible health). We calculated quality-adjusted survival in each cycle by multiplying the duration of the cycle,
the utility of each state, and the proportion in each state.
Overall quality-adjusted survival was calculated by integrating all cycles in the model. Because the medical literature
lacks detailed utility data24 for bladder cancer, we extrapolated utility scores from other conditions in which similar
health states could be expected. Disutilities (penalties to subtract from the utility of a health state) were used to model
short-term procedural complications. We assumed that utility (and disutility) scores were bounded by 0 and 1 and,
thus, could be described using a beta distribution (also

We calculated costs for each health state, including relevant
side effects and complications (Table 2). Because healthcare
costs have a lower bound of 0 but have no defined upper
bound, we assumed that variable costs followed a
gamma distribution. For cases in which variances were
unavailable, we applied a standard error equivalent to
20% of the base cost estimate. All costs were inflated to
2005 Canadian dollars using an average rate of 3% per
annum, which approximates the historic annual
Canadian inflation rate.25
Cost data on inpatient and procedure-related visits,
including short-term postoperative complications, were
obtained from the University Health Network Case Costing Center, a large, high bladder cancer volume tertiary
teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada. We similarly calculated costs of long-term operative complications (such as
bowel obstruction, ureteral stenosis, and incisional hernia)
and incorporated these costs into the model based on their
unit cost and the chance that they would occur in the postcystectomy state (Table 2).
Chemotherapy cost data for patients with bladder
cancer are not currently available.5 Consequently, costs
for chemotherapy were extrapolated from a multinational
costing study that assessed the costs of gemcitabine/cisplatin in nonsmall cell lung cancer.26 Because the administration, dosage, and number of cycles of chemotherapy is
similar for the treatment of advanced lung cancer and
bladder cancer,27-29 we assumed that the chemotherapyrelated complications and medical oncology workload
between the 2 disease sites would be similar.
The cost of dying from cancer or from other causes
was extrapolated from an ongoing comprehensive casecosting study for prostate cancer (unpublished data). In
that study, costs for 41,803 patients dying from prostate
cancer and an equivalent number of controls dying from
other causes were analyzed. We included costs incurred in
the final 6 months of life.
Fixed costs included physician service fees and drug
costs. These were obtained from the 2005 Ontario Schedule of Benefits30 and the Ontario Drug Benefits Formulary/Comparative Drug Index, 39th edition (2005),31
and from the University Health Network outpatient pharmacy. Although we assumed that unit drug costs were
fixed, we allowed for variability in the frequency and

(Table 2).
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses
We performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis to address
the joint uncertainty of all model parameters simultaneously and to provide a more accurate estimate of the average
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We performed 1000
second-order Monte-Carlo simulations and reported results
in 3 ways. First, we reported mean health outcomes and
costs with 95% credible intervals (CrIs), that is, the range
covered by 95% of our simulations. Second, we graphed
results on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, which
starts from the assumption that cost-effectiveness ratios are
5454

considered attractive if the estimates are less than the
amount society would be willing to pay for an additional
unit gain in health. We graphed the proportion of simulations that fell below a range of societal willingness-to-pay
thresholds.32 Third, we estimated the value of obtaining
additional information to help guide this treatment decision using Expected Value of Perfect Information analysis.33 These calculations were performed using a threshold
of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) both in
the presence and in the absence of quality-of-life weights
and were expressed as an average, per-patient amount.
Scenario Analyses
We evaluated several additional scenarios to explore how
results might change for different patient subgroups. Specifically, we varied the age and comorbid status of the base

case, defining comorbidity as absent (base case), mild, or
moderate, corresponding to Charlson comorbidity index
scores of 0, 1, or >1, respectively.34 On the basis of published bladder cancer studies, we modeled a proportional
increase in overall and postoperative mortality of 1.11 and
1.37, respectively, for patients with mild comorbidity and
1.48 and 1.73, respectively, for patients with moderate
comorbidity.34,35 Because patients with more comorbidities
are likely to have longer hospital stays and experience more
postoperative complications, the cost associated with major
surgery also will increase,36 although these estimates are not
known with certainty. We modified the cost of radical cystectomy in the presence of comorbidity by adding costs
equivalent to 1 standard deviation ($6124) for mild comorbidity and 2 standard deviations for moderate comorbidity.
These values correspond to published costs for systemicrelated complications after cystectomy.37

RESULTS
Base-Case Analysis
For the base case, the mean survival with immediate cystectomy was 14.61 years (95% CrI, 11.27-16.78 years),
and the mean survival with conservative BCG therapy was
13.89 years (95% CrI, 10.33-16.28 years) (Table 3). After
accounting for quality of life and discounting, immediate
radical cystectomy yielded a quality-adjusted survival of
Cancer

9.46 QALYs (95% CrI, 3.98-11.90 QALYs), and BCG
management yielded 9.39 QALYs (95% CrI, 6.16-11.49
QALYs). Immediate cystectomy was associated with
improved survival in 89% of simulations and with
improved, discounted, quality-adjusted survival in 65%
of simulations. The estimates of incremental health gain
were 0.72 life years (CrI, from 0.42 to 2.24 life years)
and 0.08 discounted QALYs (95% CrI, from 2.58 to
1.43 discounted QALYs) in favor of immediate
cystectomy.
Immediate cystectomy also was associated with
lower lifetime discounted costs ($37,600; 95% CrI,
$35,000-$40,200) compared with conservative BCG
therapy ($42,400; 95% CrI, $34,800-$47,500). Immediate cystectomy was associated with decreased costs in 91%
of simulations. The estimates of cost savings were $4800
(95% CrI, $3000-$9600) in favor of immediate cystectomy. Thus, immediate cystectomy was associated with
both better health outcomes and lower costs than conservative BCG therapy. In economic terms, this means that
such strategies dominate the alternatives and are strongly
preferred.
We constructed a cost-effectiveness acceptability
curve to illustrate the proportions of simulations (qualityadjusted and discounted) that were cost-effective at various willingness-to-pay thresholds (Fig. 2). At a cost-perQALY threshold of $50,000, immediate cystectomy was

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 2. This chart presents the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for the base case. The curve represents the proportion of simulations in which immediate cystectomy was
the cost-effective option at various willingness-to-pay thresholds. For example, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of
$20,000 per quality-adjusted life year ($/QALY), cystectomy
was cost-effective in 70% of simulations.

cost-effective in 67% of simulations. At thresholds of
$20,000 per and $100,000 per QALY, the probabilities
that immediate cystectomy was cost-effective were 70%
and 66%, respectively.
Expected Value of Perfect Information
Analysis
In our base-case analysis, the expected value of perfect information at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000
per life year gained was $1877 per patient. At a threshold
of $50,000 per QALY (ie, with quality-of-life adjustment), the expected value of perfect information was
$28,220 per patient. With approximately 65,000 incident
bladder tumors diagnosed annually in North America, of
which 15%38 (n ¼ 9750) are high-risk T1G3 lesions,
perfect information regarding all variables in the model
would be valued between $18.3 million and $275 million.
Scenario Analyses
We conducted several scenario analyses in which we
modified the age and comorbid status of the base case (Table 4). Regardless of the comorbid status, immediate cystectomy was the dominant strategy for patients aged 55
years. At aged 70 years, conservative therapy either was
dominant or was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $32,700 per QALY. Between ages
60 years and 70 years, the optimal choice depended on the
presence of comorbidities, with increasing comorbid
burden making conservative therapy more attractive
economically.
5456

The current results suggest that immediate resection is the
preferred treatment for healthy patients aged 65 years
who have high-risk T1G3 bladder cancer and is associated
with better health outcomes and lower costs than conservative BCG management. Our model, which is the first to
our knowledge that addresses this question from an economic perspective, has several strengths. First, we used
probabilistic sensitivity analysis to reflect joint uncertainty
in all input parameters. Second, our model was comprehensive, accounting for all major toxicities associated with
both surgery and conservative BCG management. Finally,
we were able to model the most cost-effective treatment
option for various levels of patient age and comorbid
status; thus, our findings are broadly applicable.
To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies
published to date have analyzed economic outcomes associated with bladder cancer. These studies have evaluated
the treatment of patients with transitional cell cancer,39,40
analyzed options for screening for bladder cancer,41,42 or
quantified costs associated with bladder cancer follow-up
and complications.37,43,44 Although those results are not
directly comparable with our analysis, these and other45,46
studies reported cost estimates that were similar to the
estimates in our model, suggesting that our single institution’s cost estimates may be broadly applicable to other
settings.
At ages <60 years or >70 years, our model suggests
possibilities for cost savings coupled with improved health
outcomes. With increasing age and comorbidity, radical
cystectomy yielded higher costs and lower health benefits.
The greater costs are attributable to the increased risk of
systemic-related complications with more comorbidities,
whereas the lower health benefits are attributable to the
greater risk of postoperative complications and death in
older, sicker patients. For patients between ages 60 years
and 70 years, our analyses suggest that cost savings with
improved health outcomes, or, at the very least, cost-effective care, is possible when therapy is tailored according to
patient age and comorbid status.
Both the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and
the calculation of the expected value of perfect information indicate considerable residual uncertainty regarding
our cost-effectiveness estimates. We estimated that an
upper limit for perfect information regarding model

QALY indicates quality adjusted life year; ICER, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
* Each cell in this table reports the discounted incremental cost and health gains (QALY) comparing conservative therapy with cystectomy. When conservative
therapy is associated with increased costs and decreased health gains, cystectomy is dominant. Conversely, conservative therapy is dominant when it is associated with lower costs and improved health effects. ICERs are calculated when both the incremental costs and effects are positive.

parameters would be at least $18.3 million (quality-unadjusted) and perhaps as high as $275 million (qualityadjusted). These limits suggest that further research aimed
at yielding more precise model inputs would be a worthwhile investment.
We acknowledge several limitations to the current
study. First, we made assumptions regarding the timing,
treatment, and costs of nonperioperative complications
after BCG therapy and cystectomy. However, our use of
relatively wide, albeit arbitrary, standard errors for these
parameters enabled us to incorporate the uncertainty
introduced by this assumption into the model. Second,
we used a third-party payer perspective rather than a societal perspective, which generally is preferred.10 The societal perspective may be particularly important for patients
who still are working, for whom the incremental indirect
costs associated with BCG instillation may be underestimated. Thus, our findings are likely to be conservative in
this scenario. Third, we extrapolated the costs of dying of
bladder cancer from the costs of dying of hormone-refracCancer

tory prostate cancer because of similarities in metastatic
landing sites (ie, lymph nodes, bone, lung, liver) and complications (such as bone and pelvic pain and bladder outlet
obstruction) experienced by patients with both diseases.
The costs of bladder cancer chemotherapy were extrapolated from costs of treating lung cancer with gemcitabine
and cisplatin, because the regimens for each are quite similar. Although these assumptions have face validity, they
have not been tested empirically. Fourth, we made
assumptions regarding the treatment of T1G3 recurrences
while receiving conservative BCG therapy, assuming a
second cycle of induction and maintenance BCG therapy.
Although our current model included the option of cystectomy after a T1G3 recurrence, which is a legitimate
treatment approach in high-risk patients, sensitivity analyses in our previous work demonstrated that changes in
model structure pertaining to the timing of cystectomy after T1G3 recurrence minimally influence health outcomes.9 Fifth, we extrapolated utilities from nonbladder
cancer health states because of the absence of utility data

in this regard. Although we believe that this approach is
reasonable, we acknowledge that it may introduce error
into our model. The uncertainty around this estimate can
be appreciated by comparing the expected value of perfect
information without and with quality adjustment ($18.3
million and $275 million, respectively). Hence, better
utility estimates in bladder cancer constitute a priority
topic for future research. Finally, the estimates of expected
value of perfect information may be too high, because we
incorporated wide standard errors for parameters that had
uncertain values.
In conclusion, the results of the current study indicated that, for healthy patients aged 60 years with T1G3
bladder cancer, immediate radical cystectomy would provide improved survival and quality-adjusted survival at
lower cost. However, for patients aged 70 years, the
most cost-effective therapy is initial conservative treatment with intravesical BCG. Proper risk stratification can
help optimize patient outcomes while decreasing costs to
the healthcare system.
