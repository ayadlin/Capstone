ABSTRACT
Purpose: A sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracer can gain multi-functionality by
combining it with additional components. We developed a SLN tracer consisting of
iodine and docetaxel and applied it as a theragnostic nanoparticle to simultaneously
perform SLN computed tomography (CT) lymphography and locoregional
chemotherapy of the draining lymphatic system.
Results: Docetaxel could be loaded in iodine emulsions at a drug-to-surfactant
weight ratio as high as that in the drug formulation Taxotere®. The particle size
and drug concentration were stable during storage for up to 3 months in optimized
nanoemulsions. Popliteal LN enhancement on CT was observed in all healthy rabbits
(n=3) and VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits (n=6) 12 hours after injection. The rate of
SLN metastasis was significantly lower in the treatment group (29.4%, 5/17) than
in the non-treatment group (70.6%, 12/17) (P=0.038).
Material and Methods: We prepared a nanoemulsion carrying both iodine
and docetaxel in a single structure by optimizing the composition of surfactants
surrounding the inner iodized oil core. CT was performed 12 hours after subcutaneous
injection of the emulsion in healthy rabbits (n=3) and VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits
(n=6) for SLN imaging. Next, we tested the effect of treatment by histopathologically
assessing the popliteal LN metastasis rate in VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits 7 days after
subcutaneous injection of the emulsion (treatment group, n=17) and comparing it
with that of non-treatment group rabbits (n=17).
Conclusions: We developed an iodine-docetaxel emulsion and demonstrated that
it can be applied to simultaneously achieve CT SLN imaging and local chemotherapy
against nodal metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

simultaneous SLN detection by CT lymphography and
locoregional chemotherapy against microscopic metastasis
within the draining lymphatic system.

Regional lymph nodes (LNs) are one of the most
frequent sites of early carcinoma metastasis. The presence
of regional LN metastasis not only reflects a more
malignant nature of the tumor, but also is a potential source
of subsequent distant metastasis [1]. It has been reported
that improved local therapies can lead to better treatment
outcomes in breast cancer, gastric cancer, rectal cancer, and
malignancies arising in other organs [1–4]. However, as nonsurgical or minimally invasive treatments are increasingly
performed, the diagnosis and treatment of regional LN
metastasis becomes extremely challenging because these
procedures often omit LN dissection. Therefore, strategies
to effectively diagnose and eradicate nodal metastatic tumor
cells are extremely important, especially if a non-surgical
and/or minimally invasive treatment option is considered.
The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as the
first LN that directly receives lymph flow from the primary
tumor, and is the most likely site of early nodal metastasis.
If the SLN is free from metastasis, the risk of metastasis to
other LNs is considered low [5]. Therefore, SLN biopsy
has been established as an effective method to determine
whether surgical LN dissection is necessary, especially
in breast cancer and malignant melanoma, and to a lesser
extent in other kinds of tumors [6–8].
In practice, the basic strategy to identify the SLN
is to perform peri-tumoral injection of lymphatic tracers
and subsequently detect the LNs that uptake the tracers.
Traditionally, radioactive colloids and vital dyes have
been the most popular lymphatic tracers used. However, in
spite of their usefulness, these tracers also have technical
limitations, such as rapid wash away of vital dyes and
poor resolution for radioactive colloids [9]. To enhance the
feasibility and expand the applicability of SLN detection,
several groups, including ours, have recently produced
and tested various SLN tracers based on various imaging
modalities, including but not limited to CT [9–11], MRI
[12, 13], contrast-enhanced ultrasonography [14], and
optical imaging [9, 15].
In our previous work, we synthesized an emulsion
consisting of iodine and indocyanine green that served as a
SLN tracer that enabled hybrid imaging by CT and optical
imaging [9]. Such experience led us to hypothesize that
multiple components with different roles can be packaged
into a single SLN tracer to achieve multi-functionality. We
speculated that the scope of SLN tracer use may be expanded
beyond diagnosis to treatment of nodal metastasis if we
produced a theragnostic emulsion by marinating a cytotoxic
agent into the scaffold of the SLN tracer. With this approach,
SLN imaging based on such a tracer would accomplish not
only SLN detection, but also chemotherapy that selectively
targets the draining lymphatic system, which might carry
metastatic tumor cells.
The purpose of this study was to synthesize
a theragnostic emulsion containing both iodine and
docetaxel and apply it to a rabbit tumor model, to achieve

RESULTS
Physicochemical characterization of the i­odinedocetaxel emulsion
The optimal combination of surfactants with a high
and low hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value is critical for
achieving a stable and fine emulsion [16]. To produce an
oil-in-water type emulsion with nanoscale particles, Tween
80 and Span 85 were selected as the major hydrophilic
surfactant and lipophilic cosurfactant, respectively. Tween
80 was also selected because it is the major surfactant used
in Taxotere®, a commercially available docetaxel product.
We first prepared nanoemulsions of different
surfactant compositions with a fixed total amount
of surfactant (240 μmole) to investigate the optimal
hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfactant ratio in terms of
the loaded docetaxel concentration and particle size
of the resultant emulsions. When nanoemulsions were
prepared with increasing Tween 80 content (25 to 87
mol%), the loaded docetaxel content increased, but the
mean particle size of the emulsions decreased in a Tween
80 content-dependent manner (Supplementary Table I).
The polydispersity index (PI) of all emulsions was below
0.3, showing a homogenous distribution of emulsions
regardless of surfactant composition. Emulsions with
a >5 mg/ml loaded docetaxel concentration and <100
nm mean particle size could be obtained with 240 μmole
total surfactant composed of an 87:13 Tween 80:Span 85
mixture; we adopted this composition for the synthesis of
iodine-docetaxel emulsions for further experiments. In case
of Tween 80:Span 85 micelles (without an oil core), the
concentration of loaded docetaxel and the mean particle size
were similar to those of Tween 80:Span 85 emulsions. These
data indicate that, although docetaxel is somewhat soluble in
Lipiodol (data not shown), the presence of Lipiodol did not
further increase docetaxel loading.
Reducing the total surfactant amount may be
beneficial for reducing surfactant-related side effects,
such as hypersensitivity reactions after administration
in cancer patients. We therefore investigated the effect
of the total amount of surfactant mixture on the loaded
docetaxel concentration, mean droplet size, and PI of
the nanoemulsions. As shown in Supplementary Table I,
reducing the total amount of surfactant from 240 to 60 μmole
at a fixed Tween 80:Span 85 ratio decreased the loaded
docetaxel concentration by 3.7-fold while increasing the
particle size by 2.2-fold. These data indicate that the loaded
docetaxel concentration was very dependent on the total
surfactant amount, and 240 μmole of surfactant mixture per
milliliter of emulsion dispersions was required to produce
iodine-docetaxel emulsions with nanoscale size.

Because the use of nanoparticles as a carrier for
taxane drugs, including docetaxel, is often hampered by
the time-dependent release/precipitation of the drug [16],
the stability of iodine-docetaxel emulsions was tested
by measuring time-dependent changes in mean particle
size and concentration of loaded docetaxel. Docetaxel
loaded in emulsions containing 65% Tween 80 tended to
precipitate in a time-dependent manner during storage at
4°C. Greater than 40% of loaded docetaxel was released/
precipitated from micelles after 2 weeks of storage (Figure
1A). In contrast, nanoemulsions containing 87% Tween
80 showed greatly improved stability; no significant
loss of docetaxel loaded in nanoemulsions was observed
after storage for up to 8 weeks at 4°C. With regard to the
mean particle size, no significant change in the particle
size was found during storage up to 12 weeks, regardless
of formulation (Figure 1B). Collectively, these results
suggest that nanoemulsions with an inner iodized oil core
stabilized by an 87:13 mixture of Tween 80 and Span 85
are a potential vehicle for stably carrying docetaxel.
The diameter and morphology of the emulsion
obtained with the 87:13 mixture of Tween 80:Span 85
were also determined by TEM. As demonstrated by
the representative TEM image shown in Figure 1C, the
majority of the particles in this emulsion are spherical and
less than 100 nm in size, in agreement with the results
obtained by the dynamic light scattering method.

We performed CT lymphography in tumor-free
healthy rabbits (n=3). CT images obtained 12 hours
after subcutaneous injection of the iodine-docetaxel
emulsion demonstrated focal contrast enhancement
within the popliteal lymph node ipsilateral to the tumor
(Figure 2A).
Next, we conducted SLN imaging in the rabbit
microscopic LN metastasis model (n=6). Similar to
the tumor-free healthy rabbits, CT lymphography was
performed 12 hours after subcutaneous injection of the
iodine-docetaxel emulsion, which also revealed focal
intra-nodal enhancement by the uptake of emulsion
(Figure 2B, 2C). A second session of CT lymphography
was performed 7 days later and showed that the
iodine-docetaxel emulsion washed away, as intranodal
enhancement was no longer present (Figure 2D).

SLN CT volume measurement
The pre-treatment CT images obtained 10 days
after VX2 tumor implantation were used for volumetry.
The rabbits were alternatively allocated into the treatment
group (n=17) or non-treatment (control) group (n=17)
according to the size of the popliteal LN ipsilateral to the
implanted tumor so that the two groups had matched LN
size (mean ± standard deviation: treatment group, 0.424
± 0.130 cm3 vs. non-treatment group, 0.447 ± 0.137 cm3;
P=0.612). The size of the contralateral side popliteal
LNs were also the same between the two groups upon
allocation (mean ± standard deviation: treatment group,
0.159 ± 0.146 cm3 vs. non-treatment group, 0.182 ± 0.102
cm3; P=0.589) (Figure 3). Shortly after the pre-treatment
CT was obtained, the treatment group rabbits received a
peri-tumoral injection of the iodine-docetaxel emulsion.
Seven days after injection of the iodine-docetaxel
emulsion in the treatment group (17 days after VX2
tumor implantation), a post-treatment CT was performed.
Volumetry based on the post-treatment CT revealed
that the sizes of the ipsilateral LNs in the treatment
group compared to the non-treatment group were not
significantly different (mean ± standard deviation:
treatment group, 0.900 ± 0.283 cm3 vs. non-treatment
group, 0.812 ± 0.193 cm3; P=0.296). Meanwhile, the sizes
of the ipsilateral popliteal LNs significantly increased in
both the treatment and non-treatment groups when the size
measured on the post-treatment CT was compared with
that of the pre-treatment CT within each group (paired
t-test, P<0.001 in both groups) (Figure 3). However, the
volume of the contralateral popliteal LN measured on the
post-treatment CT did not differ between the two groups
(mean ± standard deviation: treatment group, 0.176 ±
0.217 vs. non-treatment group, 0.176 ± 0.090; P=1.000),
nor did it differ when comparing the pre-treatment CT and
post-treatment CT of either group (paired t-test, within
treatment group P=0.332; within non-treatment group
P=0.332) (Figure 3).

CT lymphography for SLN imaging
In our previous study, we demonstrated that watersoluble emulsions containing iodine can serve as an effective
CT lymphography tracer [9]. Our newly-synthesized
iodine-docetaxel emulsion was similar to the previous
versions in design and synthesis protocol, but differed in
composition. Therefore, we first intended to verify whether
the iodine-docetaxel emulsion would reliably serve as a CT
lymphography agent, by testing in both healthy rabbits and
microscopic LN metastasis rabbit models.
The LN metastasis model was generated by
passage of tumors from the popliteal LN of VX2 tumorimplanted rabbits to additional heathy rabbits. Initially,
the passage of VX2 tumors harvested from the popliteal
LN was successful in no more than 50% of the rabbits,
but the success rate gradually increased as we repeated
passaging the tumors (data not shown). We believe that a
tumor subpopulation with an enhanced tendency for nodal
metastasis was selected for during passaging, causing
the rate of popliteal LN metastasis to gradually increase.
After several cycles of tumor passaging, we were able to
establish a VX2 tumor line that showed enhanced nodal
metastasis potential and usually achieved a popliteal LN
metastasis rate of approximately 90% (data not shown)
when incubated for 4 weeks after implantation. All
subsequent experiments were performed using this VX2
tumor line.

used for SLN detection [9]. We hypothesized that if
the water-soluble emulsion is mixed with a cytotoxic
agent, then the tumor draining lymphatic system would
become selectively exposed to the cytotoxic agent in high
concentration as the tracer accumulates. Consequently,
a fortified chemotherapy regimen specifically targeting
the compartment of the draining lymphatic system could
be established. To fulfill this scenario, we integrated the
chemotherapy agent docetaxel into the scaffold of our
previous version of emulsion designed as an SLN tracer.
We believe that our approach can not only enable SLN
detection, but also actively eradicate microscopic LN
metastasis.
The capability to simultaneously perform SLN
imaging and locoregional chemotherapy of the draining
lymphatic system has several clinical implications and
advantages. Most importantly, under usual clinical
settings a surgical biopsy may not be feasible even if SLN
imaging is practically possible. Nowadays, minimally
invasive procedures, such as endoscopic resection or
trans-anal operation, are increasingly performed for
the treatment of early gastric cancer or early colorectal
cancer, but the prediction and treatment of potential nodal

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we developed an iodinedocetaxel emulsion and demonstrated that it can be
applied as a SLN lymphography tracer and a vehicle
that selectively delivers a chemotherapy agent into the
tumor draining lymphatic system. We showed that peritumoral injection of our iodine-docetaxel emulsion can
significantly reduce the rate of LN metastasis in a LN
micro-metastasis model (VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits).
In our previous study, we developed a watersoluble emulsion containing iodized oil and fluorescent
dye and demonstrated that it can be used to perform
SLN hybrid imaging with both CT and optical devices
[9]. Based on such experience, we learned that a variety
of emulsions can be produced to generate tracers with
additional capabilities. We also previously showed that
water-soluble emulsions with optimal particle size will
accumulate within the draining LNs, instead of being
rapidly washed away like the classical vital dye tracers

of popliteal LN metastasis was 29.4% (n=5/17) in the treatment group versus 70.6% (n=12/17) in the non-treatment group, indicating that
LN metastasis occurred less frequently in the treatment group (*P=0.038).

metastasis remains a challenge because LN biopsy is not
possible during these procedures [17, 18]. However, peritumoral injection of SLN tracers can be easily performed
during these minimally invasive procedures along with a
subsequent CT lymphography to perform SLN imaging.
The treatment effect of our iodine-docetaxel emulsion can
reduce the risk of potential microscopic LN metastasis,
which we believe is a significant advantage because such
minimally invasive endoscopic resection procedures stand
on the assumption that tumor cells have not entered the
draining lymphatic system, despite the fact that the LNs
remain unexamined.
In early gastric cancer, the risk of LN metastasis
has been reported to range between 1% to 3% if the
tumor is confined to the mucosa, and 11% to 20% if
the tumor invades the submucosa [18, 19]. Currently,
endoscopic resection is considered as standard treatment
in carefully selected patients who meet the absolute
indication (differentiated type adenocarcinoma without
ulcer and the depth of invasion is clinically diagnosed
as T1a and the diameter is ≤2cm) because the risk of
positive LN metastasis is low in these patients [20].
Meanwhile, ongoing debate exists on whether or not
endoscopic resection can be safely performed in early
gastric cancer beyond the absolute indication due to
the risk of regional LN metastasis [21–23]. We believe
that our iodine-docetaxel emulsion, which can be easily
injected around the tumor during endoscopic resection,
can be applied to control any undetected microscopic
LN metastasis and therefore contribute to expand the
application of such minimally invasive treatments.
Moreover, this approach also can detect the SLN (or
SLN basin) by CT, which can be used if a SLN biopsy is
later decided to be necessary.
Our iodine-docetaxel emulsion can also improve
safety in patients who decide not to undergo curative
resection based on a negative SLN biopsy. Although
SLN biopsy is an established method in several kinds of
malignancies, the risk of a false negative report cannot
be eliminated for several reasons. Firstly, during daily
practice, a whole-mount examination of the retrieved
SLN cannot be performed, and thus under-sampling is
inevitable. Secondly, the current SLN detection methods
have a risk of technical failure. Water-soluble dyes,
including vital dyes, not only rapidly wash away and
therefore allow only limited time for assessment, but
may become obscured when covered by dense fat tissue.
Radioactive colloid tracers have poor spatial resolution
and are known to exhibit poor sensitivity when the LN
is near the injection site because of high background
scattering (shine-through effect) [24–26].
According to clinical reports, the majority of
metastatic LNs discovered in colorectal and gastric cancer
patients were not significantly enlarged [27–29], which
is why the prediction of nodal metastasis is extremely
challenging. The presence of an overt metastatic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

deposit (and consequently an unequivocally enlarged
LN) would frequently occlude the lymphatic channels,
causing SLN imaging based on tracer injection to be
inaccurate. However, we believe that larger LNs would
likely carry metastatic deposits with a tumor burden
at a level that is unreasonable to attempt treatment
based on a non-surgical method, including our iodinedocetaxel emulsion injection method. Therefore, we
excluded rabbits with large popliteal LNs (>1 cm3) at
pre-treatment CT.
In the current study, the size of the ipsilateral LNs
measured on post-treatment CT increased during the 7 day
incubation period in both the treatment group and nontreatment group (P<0.001 in both) when compared with
the pre-treatment CT. However, in spite of the difference
in the nodal metastasis rate between the treatment group
and non-treatment group, the size of the LNs of the two
groups was not significantly different (mean ± standard
deviation: treatment group, 0.900 ± 0.283 cm3 vs. nontreatment group 0.812 ± 0.193 cm3; P=0.296). This
implies that although treatment with the iodine-docetaxel
emulsion might lower the rate of nodal metastasis, the
treatment response is not reflected by a decrease in size of
a particular LN, which would make it difficult to predict
eradication of potential metastasis based on size alone. We
believe that the increased size of non-metastatic LNs is
probably associated with the state of reactive hyperplasia
[29, 30].
It has been reported that docetaxel can reach much
higher concentrations when packed in lipid emulsion
form [31]. Docetaxel is a lipophilic agent, and the lipid
emulsion can serve as a drug carrier that allows for the
slow release of docetaxel [31]. A previous study showed
that lipophilic drugs formulated in lipid emulsions can
reach higher plasma concentrations than those in solution
after intravenous injection [32]. Thus, by synthesizing our
tracer in lipid emulsion form, we attempted to achieve
similar pharmacokinetic benefits and speculated that the
concentration of docetaxel within the draining LNs could
be maximized.
Our formulation study, which was performed
to optimize the composition of surfactants in order to
maximize the loaded docetaxel concentration in the
emulsion tracer, demonstrated that 240 μmole/ml of an
87:13 mixture of Tween 80:Span 85 enabled docetaxel
loading at a 4% drug-to-surfactant weight ratio, a ratio
comparable to that in Taxotere®, where 40 mg docetaxel
is solubilized in an ethanol-surfactant mixture containing
1075 mg Tween 80 (3.6%). The mean size of optimized
emulsions was less than 100 nm, the upper size limit
for colloidal particles to enter the lymphatic capillaries
quickly and accumulate in regional LNs after subcutaneous
administration [33]. Moreover, they exhibited very high
stability in terms of particle size and loaded docetaxel
content during storage. Since docetaxel was retained as
loaded in nanoemulsions but not in micelles obtained
27184

Oncotarget

with the same Tween 80:Span 85 surfactant ratio, it
seems likely that the presence of iodized oil contributed
to inhibiting the docetaxel precipitation. We believe that
the docetaxel was likely solubilized mainly in the iodized
oil core together with surfactants; thus, the presence of
iodized oil not only enables CT imaging but also stabilizes
docetaxel-loaded emulsions.
We acknowledge that our study had a few
limitations. Firstly, our study was based on a microscopic
LN metastasis animal model in which the presence or
absence of LN metastasis was unknown at the time of
iodine-docetaxel emulsion injection. As a result, we
were not able to measure the direct treatment effect on
LN metastasis. To compensate for this limitation, we
established a balanced control group with matched
popliteal LN sizes, which served as a non-treatment
(control) group for comparison. Secondly, to ensure the
clarity of this proof-of-concept study, we performed
experiments while using the popliteal LN as the SLN
for the VX2 tumor implanted in the lower extremity.
However, the lymphatic vessels of this area are very
simple, and therefore we do not believe that our iodinedocetaxel emulsion has been sufficiently validated as a
SLN tracer. We intend to pursue further validation in a
more clinically relevant tumor model with more complex
lymphatic structures.
In conclusion, we have developed an iodinedocetaxel emulsion and applied it to simultaneously
accomplish SLN detection based on CT lymphography
and eradication of potential LN metastasis by selectively
delivering chemotherapy into the draining lymphatic
system.

added 0.7 ml of saline dropwise to the pre-emulsion
concentrate while vortexing, followed by sonication in a
bath sonicator at 37°C for 30 min. The obtained emulsions
were placed in an ice bath, then homogenized at 11,000
rpm using a homogenizer (IKA-Wereke, Stufen, Germany)
in four intervals (durations: 10, 5, 5, and 5 min), to obtain
a homogeneous nanoemulsion. Unloaded docetaxel was
removed from the emulsion dispersion by filtering through
an 0.8-μm syringe membrane filter. The filtered emulsions
were stored at 4°C until use.

Physicochemical characterization of emulsions
The mean particle size and PI of the nanoemulsions
were measured by dynamic light scattering using a fiberoptic particle analyzer (FPAR-1000, Otsuka Electronics,
Japan). Prior to measurement, the emulsion dispersions
were appropriately diluted with filtered saline. The PI was
obtained as a measure of the uniformity of the particle size
distribution in colloidal dispersions [35].
The concentration of docetaxel loaded in the
emulsions was determined by reversed-phase HPLC
analysis [35]. In brief, 50 μl of each filtered emulsion
was rapidly frozen, dried in a freeze dryer (FDU-1200,
EYELA, Japan), then redissolved in methanol. Twenty
microliters of sample were injected into the Nanospace SI2HPLC system (Shiseido, Japan) equipped with a mobile
phase delivery pump (SP 3201) and UV-vis detector
(SP 3002). A mixture of acetonitrile and distilled water
(65:35, v/v) was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate
of 1 ml/min. A reversed-phase Capcell pak C18 column
(UG120, Shiseido, Japan) was used at 35°C. The detector
wavelength was set at 230 nm.
The diameter and morphology of nanoemulsions
were also determined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM; Tecnai G2 Spirit, FEI) at an accelerator voltage of
120 kV. For observation, 5 μl of emulsion were applied
to carbon-coated grids that had been glow discharged for
3 min in air and immediately (within ~5 sec) negatively
stained using 1% uranyl acetate.
The stability of nanoemulsions was evaluated by
monitoring the changes in mean particle size and the
docetaxel content remaining loaded in emulsions during
storage at 4°C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Experimental
Animal Ethical Committee of Yonsei University College
of Medicine (approval number: 2013-0248).

Preparation of nanoemulsions
Sorbitan
trioleate
(Span
85)
and
polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Docetaxel was purchased from LC laboratories (Woburn,
MA, USA). Lipiodol, an FDA-approved iodized oil, was
purchased from Guerbet (Aulnay-Sous-Bois, France). All
other materials were of reagent grade and used without
further purification.
Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared using a
homogenization method as previously described [34].
Briefly, 7 mg of docetaxel and 300 μl of Lipiodol were
dissolved in ethanol together with varying amounts of
surfactant mixture (Tween 80 and Span 85). Ethanol was
removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator
until a pre-emulsion concentrate was obtained. We then

Animal model of popliteal LN metastasis
Male New Zealand white rabbits weighing from
3 to 3.5 kg each were used. Anesthesia was induced by
intramuscular injection of 5 mg of a 1:1 combination
mixture of zolazepam (Zoletil; Vibrac Laboratories,
Carros, France) and xylazine hydrochloride (Rompun;
Bayer, Seoul, Korea) per kilogram body weight.
VX2 tumors exhibiting enhanced tendency to
metastasize to the LN were selected through multiple
rounds of passaging. Rabbits implanted with a VX2 tumor

in the lower extremity muscle were incubated for 4 to 5
weeks to allow popliteal LN metastasis to occur. Under
anesthesia, the popliteal LN ipsilateral to the implanted
tumor (where it was assumed, but not confirmed, that nodal
metastasis had developed) was harvested and minced into
approximately 1-mm3 pieces. This fresh tissue suspension
was implanted into another rabbit within the muscles at the
outer side of the distal portion of right tibia at a total volume
of 0.1 ml. The rabbit was incubated for 4 to 5 weeks until
tumor passage to the next rabbit was performed.

LNs may represent LNs carrying gross metastasis deposits
rather than microscopic metastases. As we tried to simulate
a microscopic nodal metastasis model, we intended to
exclude rabbits with LNs carrying overt metastasis at the
time of SLN assessment. Therefore, we defined 1 cm3 as
a volume threshold and excluded rabbits (n=2) in which
the volume of their ipsilateral popliteal LNs exceeded 1
cm3 on pre-treatment CT. The remaining rabbits (n=34)
were alternatively allocated into the treatment group
(n=17) or non-treatment (control) group (n=17) according
to the volume of the ipsilateral popliteal LN measured on
pre-treatment CT. Shortly after the pre-treatment CT scan
was obtained and volumetry was performed, the treatment
group rabbits received peri-tumoral subcutaneous
injections (three 0.7 ml injections, 2.1 ml in total) around
the tumor nodule. Seven days later (17 days after the
tumor was implanted), a post-treatment CT scan was
conducted. Afterwards, all rabbits were euthanized with
saturated potassium chloride and the bilateral popliteal
LNs were sampled.

SLN imaging based on CT lymphography
First, we intended to test whether our iodinedocetaxel emulsion could serve as a SLN tracer. Under
anesthesia, we subcutaneously injected the iodinedocetaxel emulsion at the right lower extremity in healthy
control rabbits (n=3) and VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits
(n=6, incubated for 10 days). Each rabbit received three
0.7-ml injections for 2.1 ml in total, either within a
narrow area (healthy rabbits) or at a peri-tumoral location
(tumor-implanted rabbits). CT images were obtained
before and 12 hours after subcutaneous injection of the
iodine-docetaxel emulsion. The VX2 tumor-implanted
rabbits underwent a follow-up CT scan 7 days after this
procedure.
CT lymphography was performed with a
commercial 64-channel multidetector scanner (Discovery
CT750 HD; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) with the
following parameters: 120 kV, 250 mA, 0.625-mm beam
collimation, and 1.25-mm axial reconstruction thickness.
The field of view was adjusted to include the entire
abdomen and lower extremities.

Analysis of the dissected popliteal LNs
The sampled popliteal LNs were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin overnight, then embedded in paraffin and
sectioned at 5-mm intervals. We performed hematoxylin
and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining
using anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies (anticytokeratin AE1+AE3 antibody, Abcam Inc., Cambridge,
MA). The slides were reviewed by a pathologist (K.S.K.)
with 5 years of experience in experimental animal
histopathology to determine the presence or absence of
metastatic tumor cells.

Treatment response measurement

Statistical analysis

Thirty-six New Zealand white rabbits implanted
with a VX2 tumor in the muscle of right side lower
limb and incubated for 10 days served as a model of
microscopic LN metastasis. A CT scan was performed
twice, just before peri-tumoral injection of the iodinedocetaxel emulsion (pre-treatment CT) and 7 days after
injection (post-treatment CT). Volumetry of popliteal LNs
was also conducted twice in each rabbit based on the pretreatment CT and post-treatment CT.
For volume measurement of the popliteal LNs, the
CT axial images were archived in Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and stored
on a General Electric Advantage v4 work station (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The region of interest (ROI)
was drawn along the margin of the popliteal LN on each
slice, and total mass was calculated by adding ROI areas
in consecutive images. The volumes of popliteal LNs were
measured on both the ipsilateral and contralateral side to
the implanted tumor.
In humans, it is known that metastatic LNs tend
to increase in size [36, 37], and we speculated that large
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis was performed using standard
software (SPSS v20.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA). Student’s t-test was used to compare the volume
of popliteal LNs between the treatment group and nontreatment group. Paired t-test analysis was applied to
compare the volumes of a popliteal LN measured on
the pre-treatment and post-treatment CT scans. Fisher’s
exact test was performed to compare the rate of tumor LN
metastasis between the treatment group and non-treatment
group. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.
