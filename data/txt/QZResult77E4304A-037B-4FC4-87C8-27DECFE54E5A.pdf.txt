BACKGROUND: Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare and aggressive B-cell lymphoma strongly associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The authors conducted a multi-institutional, retrospective study to describe characteristics and determine prognostic factors in HIV-associated PBL. METHODS: For this study, the investigators included consecutive, HIV-positive
patients diagnosed between the years 2000 and 2010 whose tumors had a plasmablastic morphology, were cluster of differentiation
20 (CD20)-negative, and expressed markers of plasmacytic differentiation. RESULTS: Fifty patients from 13 institutions were evaluated. The median age was 43 years, and there was a male predominance. The median count of cells that were positive for CD4 (a
glycoprotein expressed on the surface of T-helper cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells) was 206 cells/mm3. At presentation, 90% of patients had extranodal involvement, 69% presented with advanced stage disease, and 27% had oral involvement.
Rearrangements of v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) were detected in 41% of the tested patients. Eighty-five
percent of patients received chemotherapy, with 63% receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone and 37%
receiving more intensive regimens. The complete response (CR) rate was 66%. The median overall survival (OS) was 11 months regardless of the intensity of chemotherapy. In the survival analysis, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2,
advanced stage, and MYC rearrangements were associated significantly with a worse outcome, whereas attaining a CR with chemotherapy was associated with a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of PBL in HIV-infected individuals remains poor in the
highly active antiretroviral therapy era. Intensive chemotherapy regimens do not seem to increase survival in patients with HIV-associC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
In 1997, Delecluse and colleagues presented a case series of 16 patients with plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL), an aggressive
subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics.1 In that case series, the
large majority of patients had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and presented with involvement of the oral
cavity. PBL has been included in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification as 1 of the lymphomas observed
more commonly in HIV-infected individuals.2
It is believed that the cell of origin of PBL is a postgerminal center B-lymphocyte or plasmablast.3 Hence, the malignant
cells in PBL usually do not express cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) (B-lymphocyte antigen) but do express markers of

plasmacytic differentiation, such as CD38 (cyclic adenosine
diphosphate ribose hydrolase), CD138 (syndecan-1), or
multiple myeloma oncogene 1/interferon regulatory factor
4 (MUM1/IRF4), akin to plasma cell myeloma (PCM).4
However, based on genomic profiling, PBL appears to be
more in line with DLBCL.5 Case reports and small case series have demonstrated that HIV-associated PBL is associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor survival
rates with standard therapies.6,7 PBL, hence, poses a challenge for hematopathologists and oncologists alike. We conducted a multi-institutional, retrospective study to evaluate
the characteristics and determine prognostic factors in
patients with a pathologic diagnosis of HIV-associated PBL
in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case Selection

Institutions in the United States, Europe, and South
America submitted patient-level data on consecutive
HIV-positive individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of
PBL. This study has been approved by the institutional
review board at each of the participating centers. For this
study, all patients were required to have plasmablastic
morphology, be CD20 negative, and express at least 1
plasmacytic marker (ie, CD38, CD138, and/or MUM1/
IRF4). All cases were diagnosed between the years 2000
and 2011 and were reviewed by 2 hematopathologists at
the center of initial diagnosis. Cases of primary cutaneous
and primary brain PBL and cases of PBL diagnosed in
HIV-negative individuals were not included. Three
patients have been previously reported.8 Clinical data
included age, sex, performance status according to the
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale,
years of HIV infection before PBL diagnosis, count of
cells positive for CD4 (a glycoprotein expressed on the
surface of T-helper cells, monocytes, macrophages, and
dendritic cells), HIV viral load, receipt of HAART,
opportunistic infections, the presence of B symptoms, the
number and location of extralymph node sites, disease
stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, age-adjusted
International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) score, chemotherapeutic regimen, receipt of radiotherapy, response and
method of response assessment, final outcome, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cause
of death. Laboratory data included hemoglobin level,
white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute lymphocyte
(ALC) and platelet counts, and the presence of a monoclonal spike by serum protein electrophoresis. Pathologic
data included immunohistochemical expression of CD45
(protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, type C), CD20,

for the T-cell receptor), CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule), CD38, CD138, MUM1/IRF4, B-cell lymphoma 2
(BCL2), BCL6, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK),
Epstein Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein-1
(LMP1), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), and Ki67. Molecular studies included the detection of EBV-encoded RNA (EBER)
by in situ hybridization, HHV8 by polymerase chain reaction, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene and v-myc
myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) rearrangements by standard cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ
hybridization or polymerase chain reaction studies.
Statistical Analysis

Continuous and categorical variables are presented using
descriptive statistics. Response to therapy was assessed using
the revised response criteria whenever possible.9 PFS was
defined as the time between diagnosis and progression,
death, or last follow-up. OS was defined as the time
between diagnosis and death or last follow-up. Univariate
survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier
method and the log-rank test. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. All calculations and graphs
were obtained using the statistical software MedCalc (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Of 53 patients who were identified in 13 institutions, 50
were included in the current analysis. Two patients who
were CD20-positive and 1 patient who had primary brain
involvement were excluded. Twenty-four patients (48%)
were from Europe, 23 patients (46%) were from the United
States, and 3 patients (6%) were from South America. The
median age was 43 years (range, 19-66 years). There was a
predominance of men (4:1). The median CD4-positive
count was 206 cells/mm3 (range, 5-683 cells/mm3), and the
median viral load at presentation was 261,560 copies/mL
(range, from undetectable to 4.7 million copies/mL). PBL
was the initial presentation of HIV infection in 29% of
patients (n ¼ 13). The median duration between HIV
infection and PBL diagnoses was 8.9 years (range, 0-26
years). Twenty-one patients (43%) were receiving HAART
at the time of PBL diagnosis. Selected clinical characteristics
are listed in Table 1. The most common extralymph node
sites of involvement were oral cavity (n ¼ 12; 24%), liver/
spleen (n ¼ 8; 16%), gastrointestinal tract (n ¼ 7; 14%),
central nervous system (n ¼ 7; 14%), lungs (n ¼ 6; 12%),

DISCUSSION
PBL is an aggressive, CD20-negative B-cell lymphoma that
is diagnosed more frequently in HIV-infected individuals.2
In a recent review of the literature, no more than 150 cases
of HIV-associated PBL were reported10; however, most of
Cancer

the data available consist of case reports and small case series.11 Furthermore, current data do not discern between
the pre-HAART era and the HAART era. Given the scarcity
of cases, it is understandable that there have been no prospective studies in this specific population.
The current study in a larger set of patients confirms
previous findings from smaller studies. Clinically, HIVassociated PBL is more likely to present in young men and
is characterized by advanced stage, elevated LDH levels,
extralymph node involvement, and high aaIPI scores.
Pathologically, EBER expression, MYC rearrangements,
and a Ki67 level >80% are common features of HIV5275

associated PBL. With regard to therapy and outcome, most
patients in our study received CHOP or more aggressive
regimens; and, despite a 69% CR rate to chemotherapy, the
median PFS and OS remained poor at 6 and 11 months,
respectively. Not surprisingly, obtaining a CR to chemotherapy was associated with longer OS in patients with
HIV-associated PBL. Finally, the most common cause of
death in these patients was progression of the lymphoma.
Our study also provides new information on the
biology, clinical behavior, pathology, therapy, and prognosis of HIV-associated PBL in the HAART era. First, the
median CD4-positive count at the time of PBL diagnosis
was 206 cells/mm3. This is likely a reflection of the higher
proportion of patients on HAART at presentation in our
cohort. This is a new finding, because other, more common HIV-associated lymphomas, such as DLBCL, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and primary
effusion lymphoma, classically present with lower CD40positive counts. Conversely, the risk of the more aggressive Burkitt lymphoma does not appear to be associated
with such severe immunosuppression.12 The reasons
behind these patterns are yet to be fully explained.
Second, MYC rearrangements were detected in 41%
of the patients (n ¼ 9 of 22 patients) in our cohort, and its
presence was associated with worse PFS and OS. Our study
confirms that MYC rearrangements are frequent in PBL.8,13
The number of patients tested in our study, however, was
small, and these findings should be taken with caution. It is
noteworthy that MYC rearrangements have been associated
with a worse prognosis in other aggressive B-cell lymphomas,14,15 although most of the lymphomas associated with
MYC rearrangements have had a germinal center phenotype.15 In the case of PBL, the cell of origin is a plasmablast,
a postgerminal center B-lymphocyte that has undergone
class-switching recombination and hypersomatic mutation
but has not fully developed into a plasma cell.3 Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of acquisition
and maintenance of MYC rearrangements in postgerminal
center lymphomas.
Third, there was a difference between the original
study by Delecluse and colleagues,1 who reported 100%
oral cavity involvement, and ours, in which we observed
24% oral cavity involvement. This proportion is similar
to a recent report in patients with HIV-negative PBL in
which 21% presented with oral cavity involvement.16
Potential explanations for this discordance include the
possibility that none of the patients on the study by Delecluse et al were receiving HAART, suggesting that
HAART may have changed the scope of the disease or
that, because of an increased clinical suspicion, more PBL
5276

cases that otherwise would have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed were identified. Currently, the mechanisms are
unclear by which PBL would have a tropism for the oral
cavity of HIV-positive individuals.
Fourth, in our survival analysis, an ECOG performance status 2 and advanced clinical stage were statically
significant, adverse prognostic factors for PFS and OS. This
has been reported previously in patients with HIV-associated aggressive B-cell lymphomas but provides additional
data supporting use of the aaIPI score as a prognostic tool in
patients with PBL. CD4-positive counts <200 cells/mm3
and ALC <1.0/lL had a trend toward significance, likely
reflecting the potential role of the immune system in the
prognosis of patients with HIV-associated PBL. Lymphopenia has been variously associated with a worse prognosis in
other systemic non-Hodgkin lymphomas,17-19 but its prognostic role in PBL should be evaluated more extensively.
Although the receipt of HAART did not seem to confer a
survival advantage in our cohort, CRs to HAART have
been reported in patients with HIV-associated PBL,20 and
the initiation of HAART should be advised.
A most important finding here is that patients with a
diagnosis of HIV-associated PBL have a poor prognosis
regardless of the therapy received. In patients with aggressive
lymphoid malignancies, the lack of CD20 expression,21 a
plasmablastic morphology,22 and the presence of MYC rearrangements14 identify tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy and confer a worse outcome. In our cohort, the
median OS of the 25 patients who received CHOP or
CHOP-like regimens did not differ significantly compared
with the 15 patients who received more intensive regimens,
such as hyper-CVAD or the Magrath regimen. This supports findings from a previous literature review in which no
survival benefit was reported from regimens that were more
intensive than CHOP.23 It is understandable that, given the
poor results observed with CHOP-like regimens and the
presence of MYC rearrangements in patients with PBL, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network would recommend more intensive regimens.24 Although the results from
our study do not support such a recommendation, future
prospective studies are needed to address the effect of therapeutic regimens on survival.
There are several potential therapeutic options for
patients with PBL. Recently, a small case series in HIVnegative PBL suggested that autologous HSCT in first
remission was associated with an improved survival in
such patients.25 In our study, 1 patient underwent autologous HSCT in first CR, and 3 patients underwent autologous HSCT in the relapsed setting. At the time of this
report, none of the patients who underwent

transplantation remained alive. Other options include
borrowing agents from the antimyeloma armamentarium.
A few case reports have suggested that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) may be active in PBL.26,27 In
addition, recent data indicate specific activity of bortezomib in patients with postgerminal center DLBCL.28
Immunomodulatory agents like lenalidomide (Revlimid;
Celgene, Cambridge, Mass) also have demonstrated activity in PBL, although only at the level of case reports.26
In conclusion, in the HAART era, patients with
HIV-associated PBL have a poor prognosis. The survival
of patients with PBL does not appear to improve with
more intensive chemotherapeutic regimens. Although the
results are preliminary, it appears that MYC rearrangements are frequent in HIV-associated PBL and confer a
worse prognosis. Because novel therapies are needed to
treat these patients, we believe the current article should
increase awareness of this rare lymphoma. Multi-institutional collaboration is warranted.
