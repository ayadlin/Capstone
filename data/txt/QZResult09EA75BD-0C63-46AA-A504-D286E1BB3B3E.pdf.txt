BACKGROUND: The prognosis after recurrence of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor, and effective salvage regimens are urgently needed. METHODS: In phase 1 and pilot studies, the authors evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of a 5-day course of cladribine followed by topotecan in
pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory AML. The cladribine dose was escalated as follows: 9.1, 13.6, 16.3, and 19.5
mg/m2 per day (8.9 mg/m2 per day in the pilot study). Outcome was analyzed according to the absence (Stratum 1)
versus presence (Stratum 2) of previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-six patients (20
in Stratum 1 and 6 in Stratum 2) were treated. RESULTS: The MTD was not reached in Stratum 1, but a DLT occurred
at the lowest cladribine dosage (9.1 mg/m2 per day) in Stratum 2. Febrile neutropenia was common in both strata.
Nine (34.6%) of 26 patients experienced a complete response, and 7 (30.4%) achieved a partial response; 5 (19.2%)
were long-term survivors at the time of last follow-up. Clinical outcome was not associated with cladribine or topotecan systemic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The combination was well tolerated in Sratum 1, and the response rate was
encouraging. This regimen offers a postrecurrence treatment alternative for patients, especially those who have

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, cladribine, pediatric, recurrence, topotecan.

Substantial progress in the management of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been achieved over the

past 30 years.1-3 However, approximately 30% to 40% of patients with AML experience disease recurrence despite intensive chemotherapy and the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with FLT3 internal
tandem duplication, M6 or M7 French-American-British (FAB) subtype, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related
AML, monosomy 7 karyotype, or persistent disease after 2 courses of conventional induction chemotherapy have a particularly poor outcome. Because most frontline AML protocols feature high cumulative doses of anthracyclines, treatment
regimens for recurrent diseases should limit or avoid the use of this class of agents, particularly if salvage treatment includes
HSCT.
Cladribine is a deoxyadenosine analog. Intracellular cladribine is rapidly phosphorylated to the triphosphate, which
resists degradation by adenosine deaminase and therefore accumulates to cytotoxic levels.4 Cladribine triphosphate competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate as a substrate of DNA polymerases, and its incorporation interferes with subsequent chain elongation. Cladribine has been extensively evaluated at our institution in pediatric patients with recurrent
and refractory AML.5,6 In a phase 2 study, a 5-day continuous infusion of single-agent cladribine at a dose of 8.9/mg/m2
per day induced a high rate of response in patients with recurrent AML.6 Subsequently, cladribine has been incorporated
into upfront therapy for newly diagnosed patients with AML as a single agent or as combination therapy.7,8

Cladribine and Topotecan in Pediatric AML/Inaba et al

Topotecan, a semisynthetic analog of camptothecin, is
a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase I.9,10 Topotecan stabilizes the topoisomerase-I/DNA complex, causing DNA single-strand breaks and cell death, particularly during S-phase.
Daily 30-minute infusions of topotecan reportedly induced
significant responses in a Children’s Oncology Group phase
1 study of children with refractory leukemia.11
The functional DNA interference caused by topotecan and by cladribine may result in enhanced cytotoxicity
when these agents are given in combination. Because both
agents can be administered as short bolus infusions,8,12 we
studied various schedules of short exposure to these 2
drugs in vitro. On the basis of a preclinical trial demonstrating an inhibitory effect of cladribine followed by topotecan (given after a drug-free period) (unpublished data),
we developed a phase 1 study to determine the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) of short infusions of escalating doses of cladribine
followed by topotecan targeted to achieve a predetermined systemic exposure in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients with recurrent or refractory AML who
were aged <21 years were treated at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital and at the University of Michigan
Comprehensive Cancer Center from 1998 to 2003. They
had a life expectancy 6 weeks, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status 3, and adequate
renal (creatinine <2  normal) and hepatic (bilirubin 3
mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 500 U/dL) function. Three patients previously treated in a pilot study at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital with the same combination were
included. Patients were grouped for analysis as those who
had not previously undergone allogeneic HSCT (Stratum
1) and those who had (Stratum 2). This study and the
inclusion of the 3 additional patients were approved by
institutional review board. Signed informed consent was
obtained from patients, parents, or legal guardians, with
assent from the patients, if appropriate.
Study Design
Both drugs were administered for 5 consecutive days per
course. Cladribine was given intravenously over 3 hours at
a dosage of 9.1, 13.6, 16.3, or 19.5 mg/m2 per day; 3
patients treated in the pilot study received 8.9 mg/m2 per

day. Topotecan was administered intravenously over
30 minutes, starting 8 hours after initiation of cladribine.
The topotecan dosage was 4.0 mg/m2 on Day 1 and was
then individualized on the basis of topotecan clearance to
target a systemic exposure of 140  20 ng/mL/h. In each
stratum, the treatment and dose escalation were performed separately. All patients received filgrastim (granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor) at a dose of 5 lg/kg/d
for a minimum of 10 days, beginning 24 hours after completion of the last dose of topotecan.
A modified phase 1 design proposed by Storer13 was
adopted. At least 1 patient was treated at a starting dose
level of cladribine with topotecan for 5 days. If no DLT
was observed, the next patient received the next higher cladribine dosage. If a DLT occurred, the next patient was
treated at the previous dose level, and the traditional phase
1 design was adopted thereafter. Patients treated with this
combination at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center were evaluated for toxicity, response,
and pharmacokinetics, but did not participate in the dose
escalation scheme.
Toxicity
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). A
DLT was defined as any nonhematologic toxicity grade
3, with the exception of nausea, vomiting, and grade 3
febrile neutropenia. Any prolonged (>35 days) hematologic toxicity that included neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <300/lL) and thrombocytopenia (platelets
<30,000/lL) in the absence of persistent or progressive
disease was considered a DLT.
Response
A bone marrow aspirate and core needle biopsy were
assessed before and on Day 15 after the initiation of the first
course. A complete response (CR) was indicated by an aspirate containing <5% blast cells and a partial response (PR)
by 15% to 50% blast cells. Bone marrow studies were
repeated after 1 week if the aspirate contained 5% to 15%
blast cells. Patients were removed from the study if they
achieved less than a PR in the first course or experienced
unacceptable toxicity. Patients who had a CR or PR were eligible to receive additional courses at the same dosage level.
There was no intrapatient dose escalation or de-escalation.
Pharmacokinetically Guided
Topotecan Dosing
Each patient’s topotecan dosage was individualized to
achieve a topotecan lactone systemic exposure of 140  20

ng/mL/h.14 Briefly, plasma samples obtained before and
0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 hours after completion of the first topotecan infusion were immediately processed and analyzed. If
the single-day topotecan lactone area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was within the target range, no dose
adjustment was required. Otherwise, the topotecan dosage
was adjusted linearly on the basis of the patient’s topotecan
lactone clearance estimated from the pharmacokinetic
model, and repeat pharmacokinetic studies were performed
on Day 2. This procedure continued until the patient’s topotecan AUC was within the target range. A 2-compartment
pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the topotecan lactone
plasma concentration as previously described.14

Cladribine Pharmacokinetic Studies
On Day 1 of the first course of treatment, blood samples
were obtained before the cladribine infusion; 30, 60, and
90 minutes after the start of the infusion; at the end of the
infusion; and 2, 4, 10, and 24 hours after completion of
the infusion. The plasma cladribine concentration was
determined using a sensitive and specific bigradient, highperformance liquid chromatography assay with ultraviolet
detection.7 At 264 nanometers (nm), the range of the
standard curve was 5 to 120 nM.
A 2-compartment model was fit to the cladribine concentration-versus-time data by nonlinear regression with a
Bayesian algorithm implemented in ADAPT II and using
published values (mean and variance) as the Bayesian priors.7 Model parameters estimated for each patient included
the volume of the central compartment, elimination rate
constant, and intercompartment rate constants kcp (rate
constant from central to peripheral compartment) and kpc
(rate constant from peripheral to central compartment).
These parameters were used to simulate each patient’s
plasma concentration-time profile, from which the AUC
from time 0 to hour 24 (AUC0!24) was calculated.
Statistical Analysis
Overall survival was defined as the time between study
enrollment and death; data for survivors were censored at
the time of last follow-up. Survival was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and survival estimates were compared according to stratum and cladribine dose level by the
exact log-rank test. Fisher exact test was used to examine the
relation between clinical response and cladribine dose level,
the proportion of topotecan AUC values within the target
range after the initial dose, and the proportion of topotecan
AUC values within the target range after dose adjustment.
Logistic regression was used to assess the relation between

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of the 26 patients are summarized in
Table 1. Twenty-three patients (17 in Stratum 1 and 6 in
Stratum 2) were enrolled on the phase 1 study. Three
additional patients treated with 8.9 mg/m2 per day of
cladribine during a pilot study were assigned to Stratum
1. There were 4 cases of AML with prior MDS. Of the
20 patients in Stratum 1, 14 patients had recurrent leukemia, with a median initial remission duration of
11.4 months, and 6 had refractory disease. All 6 patients
in Stratum 2 had recurrent disease, with a median duration of initial remission of 18.5 months.
Toxicity
In Stratum 1, the regimen was generally well tolerated
(Tables 2 and 3). Febrile neutropenia was common
(10 patients), and 2 patients had documented bacteremia
(a-streptococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively).
After a patient treated at a dose of 13.6 mg/m2 per day of
cladribine had prolonged bone marrow suppression of
undetermined etiology, the cladribine dosage was assigned
according to the traditional phase 1 design. One patient
receiving 19.5 mg/m2 per day of cladribine developed grade
4 renal failure and grade 4 respiratory failure with bilateral

Cancer

pulmonary effusions. Only this patient experienced a DLT;
the MTD was not reached in this stratum.
In Stratum 2, 5 patients developed febrile neutropenia. Two patients receiving 9.1 mg/m2 per day of cladribine had grade 4 febrile neutropenia; 1 of these developed
sepsis (Enterobacter sp.) with an episode of hypotension,
and 1 had documented disseminated aspergillosis complicated by severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease. One
patient treated with a dose of 13.6 mg/m2 per day of cladribine had prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (>35 days) associated with fever. A DLT was observed
at the initial cladribine dose of 9.1 mg/m2 per day in Stratum 2, and further patient enrollment was discontinued.
Response
Nine (34.6%) of the 26 patients experienced a CR and 7
(26.9%) achieved a PR; the overall response rate was
61.5% (Table 3). In Stratum 1, 11 (55%) of the 20
patients achieved responses, and 6 (30%) had CRs. Three
patients (Patients 1, 11, and 14 in Table 3) had 1 additional course of cladribine/topotecan before subsequent
therapy. Eleven patients proceeded to allogeneic HSCT,
and 4 were changed to therapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n ¼ 2) or methotrexate and L-asparaginase (n ¼
2). Five (83%) of the 6 patients in Stratum 2 responded.
The 3 patients who had achieved CRs subsequently
underwent treatment with allogeneic HSCT, donor
lymphocyte infusion, or interleukin-2 (IL-2 ).
Of the 16 responders overall, 9 (56.3%) remained in
disease remission and received additional therapy (allogeneic HSCT in 8 patients and IL-2 in 1 patient), but 4 of
these patients died of treatment-related toxicity during
remission. Five (19.2%) of the 26 patients survived in

the 26 patients. Of the 26 studies performed after the initial topotecan dose of 4.0 mg/m2, only 6 (23%) demonstrated a topotecan AUC within the target range. Of the
remaining 28 pharmacokinetic studies (those performed
after targeted dose adjustment), 20 (72%) were within the
target range. The median dosage achieving the target
AUC in these patients was 4.0 mg/m2 (range, 1.7-6.0 mg/

Cladribine Pharmacokinetics
Cladribine pharmacokinetics were studied in 16 of the
26 patients. The necessary blood samples for 3 patients
treated before study initiation and for 7 other patients
were not available. The median cladribine systemic clearance rate was 18.1 L/h/m2 (range, 10.6-27.5 L/h/m2).
The AUC varied widely at different cladribine dose levels,
but the median systemic exposure was found to be significantly associated with the dose level (P ¼ .031) (Fig. 2A).
Response occurred at all dose levels and was not

significantly associated with the cladribine AUC (P ¼
.19) (Fig. 2B).

DISCUSSION
Because of the risk of organ toxicity posed by frontline
chemotherapy regimens for childhood AML, we sought
to develop an anthracycline-free regimen for the treatment of recurrent or refractory AML. Our preclinical
studies demonstrated that when cladribine is combined
with topotecan, its activity is schedule-dependent,
especially at clinically relevant concentrations (ie, 75 nM
topotecan15 and 290 nM cladribine).16 In these experiments, inhibition of leukemia cell growth was optimal
when cladribine was added to the culture first and topotecan was then added after a drug-free interval. It is possible
that cladribine exacerbates the disruption of normal DNA
replication caused by topotecan’s inhibition of topoisomerase, with a consequent increase in cytotoxicity. On the
basis of these in vitro results, we designed the combination
regimen to include a 5-hour delay between the end of the
cladribine infusion and the start of the topotecan infusion.
This interval allowed the plasma concentration of
cladribine to fall to approximately 40 nM, which was the
optimal cladribine concentration in the preclinical
studies.
The combination of cladribine and topotecan in the
current study appeared to be well tolerated by patients
who had not undergone allogeneic HSCT; the MTD was
not reached in this group. Because we found no association between efficacy and the cladribine dose or the cladribine/topotecan pharmacokinetics, we suggest that
cladribine at a dose of 9.1 mg/m2 per day and topotecan
at a dose of 4.0 mg/m2 per day are a reasonable dose regimen in this patient population.
Patients who had received allogeneic HSCT before
disease recurrence (Stratum 2) were found to have a high
incidence of regimen-related toxicity in the current study,
with a DLT observed at the initial dose of cladribine (9.1
mg/m2). However, 5 of 6 patients in this stratum achieved
a response; therefore, lower doses of cladribine and/or
topotecan may be considered for this patient population.
We would suggest using prophylactic antibacterial
and antifungal agents, because fever with neutropenia was
the most common toxicity of this regimen, and we
recently reported that prophylactic treatment during intensive treatment for pediatric AML reduced morbidity
because of septicemia and dramatically decreased the incidence of septicemia and of inpatient days.17

After recurrence of childhood AML, chemotherapy
alone is unlikely to be curative because of drug resistance.18 Every effort should be made to induce remission
before HSCT, but it is crucial to reduce the toxicity of
reinduction therapy to a level that allows HSCT to proceed. Various regimens, including fludarabine plus cytarabine and cytarabine plus mitoxantrone/idarubicin, appear
to give similar results.19,20 The addition of liposomal daunorubicin to fludarabine plus cytarabine is currently being
tested in an effort to improve CR rates while minimizing
cardiotoxicity. Our regimen induced an overall response
rate of 61.5% and a CR rate of 34.6%. Nine (34.6%)
patients remained in remission, although 4 died of toxicity associated with subsequent HSCT or IL-2 treatment.
These patients are at high risk of transplant-related mortality and morbidity after second remission.18,21 Therefore, innovative HSCT approaches are needed. Donorrecipient mismatch of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors and ligand in the presence of T-cell depletion can
facilitate natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity to leukemia cells.22 Reduced-intensity regimens have been used in
elderly adults or those with comorbidities and could be
considered for this patient population.23
In summary, on the basis of our extensive preclinical data, we designed and conducted what to the best of
our knowledge is the first clinical trial of cladribine and
topotecan in children with recurrent/refractory AML.
The combination of short intravenous cladribine and
topotecan infusions was found to be safe and well tolerated among patients who had not undergone allogeneic
HSCT. The response rate in this very drug-resistant
group is encouraging. This regimen offers a treatment alternative for patients previously treated with anthracycline-containing regimens.
