Death From High-Risk Prostate Cancer Versus
Cardiovascular Mortality With Hormonal Therapy
A Decision Analysis
Nataniel H. Lester-Coll, MD1; Samuel Z. Goldhaber, MD2; David J. Sher, MD, MPH3; and Anthony V. D’Amico, MD, PhD4

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have demonstrated improved survival when hormonal therapy (HT) is added to radiation therapy
(RT) for high-risk prostate cancer. However, it is still unknown whether men who have a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or MI
risk factors achieve a superior outcome from HT. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was used to compare quality-adjusted
life expectancy (QALE) in men aged 50, 60, and 70 years who received RT and no HT, 6 months of HT (short-term), or 3 years of HT
(long-term) for high-risk prostate cancer stratified by cardiac risk group. RESULTS: In men with a history of MI, there was a decrease
of 0.1 to 0.2 quality-adjusted life years and 0.5 to 0.6 quality-adjusted life years across all ages with short-term HT and long-term HT,
respectively, compared with no HT. In men without MI, receipt of short-term or long-term HT was associated with a QALE benefit versus no HT in all cohorts. Among men without MI, the optimal duration of HT was a function of age and the number of MI risk factors.
Long-term HT improved QALE (range, 1.4-5.4 years) for men aged 50 or 60 years except those with MI; whereas, for men aged 70
years with 4 cardiac risk factors, short-term and long-term HT yielded identical QALE. CONCLUSIONS: Men who received RT for
high-risk prostate cancer and had a history of MI experienced net harm when they received HT. Men without MI gained a QALE benefit from HT, even if they had up to 4 cardiac risk factors. The optimal duration of HT is a function of patient age and the number of

INTRODUCTION
The addition of hormonal therapy (HT) to radiation therapy (RT) for the treatment of high-risk localized and locally
advanced prostate cancer decreases prostate cancer-specific mortality and prolongs overall survival.1-8 However, several
studies suggest harm with regard to the endpoints of cardiovascular morbidity or death in men who receive HT, especially
those with a history of myocardial infarction (MI).4,9-15 Because randomized controlled trials typically enroll otherwise
healthy patients, presumably most enrolled patients did not have a previous MI, and this is not the subset in which it has
been suggested that harm occurs with the receipt of HT.13 In the cohort of patients who had a previous MI, the potential
risk of cardiac mortality may outweigh the survival benefit associated with HT. Furthermore, HT may increase the risk of
developing MI in men without pre-existing disease,9 which may further counteract the disease control benefits of HT with
longer follow-up.
An analysis of the Framingham Heart and Offspring Studies demonstrated that the degree of elevated cardiac risk
factors—blood pressure, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, glucose intolerance, and smoking—
can be grouped into distinct categories (optimal, borderline, and elevated). These categories allow clinicians to estimate
the overall risk of developing MI based on the number of elevated risk factors a patient has rather than calculating risk
based on the numerical values of individual risk factors.16
In addition to the potential interaction between HT and patient comorbidities, the optimal duration of HT in men
with locally advanced prostate cancer has been questioned. A modest but significant survival benefit has been demonstrated using 3 years of HT in these men.1
To our knowledge, there have been no modeling studies examining the impact of 6 months (short-term) or 3 years
(long-term) of HT on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in men who have a history of MI or 1 or more risk factors.
Therefore, we developed a Markov decision-analytic model to estimate the effect of HT receipt and its duration on QALE

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We developed a state transition Markov model using
TreeAge Pro version 2012 (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, Mass) to estimate QALE predominately in
men with localized high-risk or locally advanced prostate
cancer representing patients with a prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/mL, or Gleason scores from 8 to 10, or
2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical tumor (T) classification T2c to T4.0. It is noteworthy that,
in the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group
(TROG) 96.01 randomized trial, which was used to
derive estimates of biochemical failure and distant metastases for the model, 83% of men had high-risk prostate
cancer.5 Men enter the model at ages 50, 60, or 70 years
and exit at the time death from prostate cancer, MI, or
other causes. Men also enter the model with history of
MI, 1 to 4 elevated cardiac risk factors, and borderline or
optimal cardiac risk profiles.16 The cycle length was 1

month, and a half-cycle correction was applied.17 The
model structure is illustrated in Figure 1.
Initial Treatment

All men received radiotherapy with 66.0 to 70.4 gray
(Gy) to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 1.8-Gy to 2.0Gy fractions over 6.5 to 7.0 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy, which is considered the standard
of care, although patients in TROG 96.01 received conformal radiotherapy. In addition, half of the men in the
model received either 6 months of HT, consisting of
goserelin and flutamide, or 3 years of HT, consisting of 6
months of flutamide or bicalutamide and triptorelin followed by triptorelin alone for 2.5 years.1,5 After treatment, men were at risk for biochemical failure for 10 years
after treatment.1,5
Salvage Therapy

Men who developed biochemical failure received lifelong
HT.5 These men were at risk for progression to metastatic
disease and death from high-risk prostate cancer. We
assumed that the risk of distant metastases would decrease
6 years after initial treatment.5

Myocardial Infarction Risk

For men without a history of MI, the risk of MI was based
on age and the number elevated risk factors.16 In addition,
men who received HT had an elevated risk of developing
MI and dying from MI. These risks were elevated for 1.5
years if men received short-term HT and for 2 years if
they received long-term HT, based on the duration of testosterone suppression.9,10,18,19 Men with a history of MI
were exposed to the same increased risk of dying from MI
if they received HT.10 In men who received salvage ther1810

remained elevated for life.

without 6 months of HT were derived from the TROG
96.01 randomized trial.5 The impact of extending HT
to 3 years on biochemical failure was derived from the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) 22961 randomized trial.1 The time
interval from the development of distant metastases to
death was derived from a large surgical experience at a
center of excellence.20 Men who developed MI faced an
annual probability of death of 11%, which was a
weighted average of mortality after ST elevation and
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the GUSTOIIb trial (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded
Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes).21 The risk of
MI for men who received HT was assumed to be 1.27
times higher than the risk for men who did not receive
HT.9 If men who received HT developed MI or if men
with a history of MI received HT, then the risk of death
because of MI was assumed to be 1.96 times higher than
the risk for men with MI who did not receive HT.10
To ensure that the selected inputs would adequately
model the natural history of disease, the rates of biochemical failure and distant metastases with and without HT
were calculated. Initial probability estimates were calibrated so that model output, including the rates of biochemical failure and distant metastases, matched results of
the TROG 96.01 and EORTC 22961 trials.1,5
Age-specific rates of death from prostate cancer and
MI were subtracted from overall age-specific death rates
for men from US life tables to generate age-specific death
rates from other causes.22-24 The model was run until

patients reached age 100 years or until a cycle reward was
<0.001 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
Complications and Adverse Effects

We assumed that men would be at risk for developing
treatment-related complications within 5 years after initial
treatment and that all complications would remain stable
thereafter. Men who received salvage therapy were
assumed to be impotent for life. Complications included
urinary incontinence, bowel disturbances, and long-term
impotence that are grade 2 or greater on the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group or Common Toxicity Criteria
scales. Complication probabilities were based on a metaanalysis of complications from intensity-modulated radiation therapy.25
Utilities

A utility is a quantitative assessment of a given health state
and ranges from 0 (death) to 1 (healthy). For example, the
states of distant metastases and no evidence of disease have
utility values of 0.25 and 0.81, respectively (Table 2).
Utilities associated with prostate cancer states were based
on a standard-gamble in men aged 60 years, half of
whom had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.26 Utilities associated with MI were based on the Coronary
Heart Disease Policy Model.27 Because it is believed that
utilities in prostate cancer are multiplicative,26 a patient’s
utility was the product of a patient’s prostate cancer state,
receipt of HT, presence of MI, and treatment
complications.

Sensitivity and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses

One-way sensitivity analyses, in which 1 parameter was
varied while all others were held constant, were conducted
around all model parameters to evaluate the extent to
which parameter variability influenced the model results.
In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore
the effects of radiation dose escalation on biochemical failure.28 Ranges were based on 95% confidence intervals
and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Utilities were studied to
an upper limit of 1, representing the case of perfect health
state equivalence. Variable thresholds for which the preferred strategy (defined by the highest gain in QALE)
shifted were identified.
We performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses on
men aged 60 years to evaluate the impact of uncertainty of
individual model parameters. In probabilistic sensitivity
analysis, the model is run thousands of times, with each
run using the value of a parameter (such as recurrence
rate) that is drawn from prespecified distributions based
on literature estimates of parameter uncertainty. Parameters that were identified as sensitive in 1-way sensitivity
analysis were included in the analysis. Beta distributions
1812

were generated for utilities, and gamma distributions were
used for hazard ratios. The hazard ratio for biochemical
failure with long-term HT was calculated de novo. We
constructed a distribution based on bounds 15% above
and below its value of 0.38. The model was run over
10,000 trials for the analysis.
RESULTS
Quality-Adjusted Life Years Stratified by Age,
Cardiac Risk Factors, and Hormonal Therapy
Duration

In all cohorts, regardless of age, omission of HT was preferred for men with a history of MI. Short-term HT
resulted in a decrease of 0.1 to 0.2 QALYs, whereas
long-term HT resulted in a decrease of 0.5 to 0.6 QALYs
(Table 3).
However, for all other men, some duration of HT
led to a QALE benefit, with the optimal duration a function of age and comorbidity. For example, in men ages 50
and 60 years, long-term HT was the preferred strategy
(defined as the strategy estimated to yield the highest
QALE) in all men except those with a history of MI, producing a benefit of 1.4 to 5.4 QALYs (Table 3). In men
aged 70 years, long-term HT was only the preferred strategy for those with optimal, borderline, or, at most, 3 risk
factors, producing 1.0 to 1.9 QALYs; whereas short-term
HT was identified as equivalent to long-term HT in men
aged 70 years who had 4 risk factors, producing
0.7 QALYs.
Evaluation of Key Model Parameters

One-way sensitivity analyses revealed thresholds for several model parameters. In men with a history of MI, the
hazard ratio for an increased risk of death from MI with
HT was the only significant model parameter (Table 4).
At values greater than 1.70 (base case value, 1.96), the
omission of HT was favored. This also was the only sensitivity analysis that significantly influenced the decision
between short-term HT versus the omission of HT. In all
cohorts other than men with a history of MI, various
thresholds were encountered for the hazard ratios associated with HT and biochemical failure and distant metastases as well the utility associated with the biochemical
failure health state. Finally, a threshold of 0.71 for the
hazard ratio for dose escalation was established for men
with 4 risk factors, raising the possibility that higher doses
of radiation could be preferred over longer durations of
HT (Table 4). These cutoff points split the optimal therapy into short-term versus long-term HT.
Although there have been several studies evaluating
the impact adding HT to RT for high-risk prostate cancer,

we chose the TROG 96.01 and EORTC 22961 randomized trials for our model, because they demonstrated overall survival benefits with short-term and long-term HT.
We used sensitivity analyses to test the reductions in biochemical failure based on the RTOG 9202 and 8610 trials
and observed no changes in our results.29,30
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis

On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the preferred strategies were stable, and the magnitude of benefits was essentially unchanged relative to the base case (Table 5). Like in
the base case, men with a history of MI experienced the
largest decrement of QALE with HT. Similarly, in men
aged 60 years with 4 cardiac risk factors, short-term HT
was preferred over long-term HT. Taken together, the
probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported the model
results, emphasizing that uncertainty in key model parameters does not affect its results.
DISCUSSION
Given the delicate balance between prostate cancer and
cardiovascular outcomes, we observed that the patient’s
age and basic cardiac risk factors can be used to derive a

theoretical model for the optimal use of HT. In men with
a history of MI, QALE decreases with HT in men ages 50
to 70 years. However, we observed that short-term HT
was equivalent to short-term HT in men aged 70 years
with 4 risk factors. Long-term HT led to the optimal outcome in all other age and risk factor strata.
Indeed, exploring ranges of values for model parameters in 1-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results
were consistent over a wide variety of assumptions. Even
in men with a history of MI, there may be a potential benefit with HT, if the model assumes that the hazard of
death from MI that is <1.70. Other studies have reported
hazard ratios of 1.2,12 1.94,11 and 2.614 in addition to the
1.9610 hazard ratio used in the current study for the risk
of cardiovascular mortality with HT. Therefore, under
some scenarios, HT would be favored even in this most
unfavorable risk group. Otherwise, omission of HT was
always preferred in men with MI, regardless of age. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis validated the minimal impact of
uncertainty of the model output and demonstrated that,
even when considering uncertainty with respect to the risk
of cardiovascular mortality from HT, the model results
remain robust.

Original Article

Men with a history of MI likely have a shorter life
expectancy relative to men without previous MI. Consequently, the harms associated with HT—including both
side effects and potential risks in cardiac mortality—outweigh the improvements in prostate cancer survival. The
clinical significance of this finding is that the survival benefits observed from adding HT to RT for men with highrisk or locally advanced prostate cancer in randomized trials probably would not hold in men with a history of MI.
For men with 4 risk factors, the utility of administering
long-course versus short-course HT and its impact on
QALE was age-dependent and favored short-course HT
more often as men age. This can be explained from greater
competing risks of death and overall shorter life expectancy in older men. For all other men, even those with several risk factors, administering long-term HT was
associated with a QALE benefit.
This study had several limitations. First, the underlying risk of MI development and mortality was derived
from the Framingham studies, which are relatively old. If
modern cardiac management (eg, intensive workup to
modify risk factors like hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and assessment for reversible myocardial ischemia)
reduces the mortality of MI compared with our reference
Framingham cohort, then more men than we have predicted may benefit from HT. Indeed, because our model
confirmed the intuitive progressive benefit for men with
lower MI risk, we recommend careful cardiovascular examination, including a search for reversible risk factors
and for extensive asymptomatic disease, for men with
high-risk prostate cancer.31
Moreover, despite the revelation in large database
outcomes studies of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from HT among men with prostate cancer,
randomized controlled trials have not reported an
increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among men
with high-risk prostate cancer who received HT and RT
compared with RT alone. A simple explanation for this
discrepancy is that those studies did not evaluate cardiovascular mortality in the specific group of men with a
documented history of MI.1-8 Similarly, a recent metaanalysis of randomized trials of HT demonstrated that
HT was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. However, none of the included trials
stratified patients according to pre-existing cardiovascular
comorbidity. The meta-analysis demonstrated that men
with moderate-to-severe cardiac comorbidity had a trend
toward poorer overall survival with HT.15 Unfortunately, there are no current randomized trials that prestratify men according to cardiovascular risk. Therefore,
1814

it remains uncertain whether men with cardiac comorbidity are at an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality
with HT. A related concern is whether our results are relevant to the population that may be eligible for HT.
Actually, in the study by Nanda et al, in >5000 men
who were managed in a community-based cohort that
likely represented most of the US population, 52% had
no risk factors, 46% had 1 risk factor, and 2% had previous MI or CHF.10
Third, the model was sensitive to several health state
utility evaluations. In particular, the quality-of-life evaluation of patients with biochemical recurrence did indicate
an influence of short-term versus long-term HT in
patients with higher risk factors, in that lower values
favored long-term HT, because that approach reduces the
likelihood of prostate-specific antigen elevation. Because
health state evaluations are patient-dependent, it is critical
to assess patient preferences in deciding on the duration of
HT in the few strata of men whose decisions are affected
by these values.
In addition, the estimates of biochemical failure and
distant metastases were based on the receipt of radiation
doses from 66 to 0.4 Gy.5 Because it has been demonstrated that radiation dose escalation decreases biochemical failure, we used sensitivity analysis to explore the
theoretical effects of dose escalation.28 In fact, dose escalation did not make a meaningful difference in the results
except for men with 4 risk factors, in whom the improved
local control from dose intensification allowed a shorter
course of HT provided the higher dose reduced biochemical failure by 29%. In this subset alone, the improvements in biochemical failure with dose escalation offset
the increased morbidity and moderate disease control
benefits from long-term HT.
Finally, we caution that a Markov model does not
substitute for a prospective randomized trial. A randomized trial comparing HT of various duration with RT
alone stratified according to cardiac risk is the ideal trial
for assessing the impact of HT on cardiovascular events.
However, because several published trials previously
investigated the length of HT, it is unlikely that an additional study will be performed, emphasizing the importance of decision analysis.
In conclusion, most men with high-risk prostate
cancer will benefit from long-term HT. However, compared with long-term HT, short-term HT maximizes
QALE in a subset of men with MI risk factors. Given
the potential interaction between HT and cardiovascular
disease, it is important for the patient to recognize the
importance of achieving optimal cardiovascular health.
