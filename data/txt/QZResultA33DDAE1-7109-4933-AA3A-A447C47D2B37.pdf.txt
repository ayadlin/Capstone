Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) show potent
and selective antitumor activity despite the fact that they
induce histone hyperacetylation in both normal and tumor
cells. In this study, we showed that the inducible expression of
kRasV12 in nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells significantly lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
and sensitized cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis. Consistent
with our finding that colon cancer cell lines with mutant Ras
have reduced expression of signal transducers and activators
of transcription 1 (STAT1), we showed that inducible
expression of mutant Ras markedly decreased both basal
and inducible expression of STAT1, a transcription factor with
tumor suppressor activity. To investigate whether reduced
expression of STAT1 in cells that harbor mutant Ras
contributes to their increased sensitivity to HDACi, we
silenced the expression of STAT1 in HKe-3 cells with small
interfering RNA. Despite the fact that silencing of STAT1 was
not sufficient to alter the MMP, STAT1 deficiency, like Ras
mutations, sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by HDACi. We
showed that the induction of p21 by HDACi was significantly
impaired in HKe-3 cells with silenced STAT1 expression and
showed that the ability of butyrate to activate p21 transcription was diminished in STAT1-deficient HKe-3 cells. Finally, we
used cells with targeted deletion of p21 to confirm that p21
protects cells from butyrate-induced apoptosis, strongly
suggesting that in these cells STAT1 deficiency promotes
butyrate-induced apoptosis through impaired induction of
p21. Our data therefore establish that Ras mutations, and
consequent reduction in the expression of STAT1, underlie
the increased susceptibility of transformed cells to undergo
apoptosis in response to treatment with inhibitors of HDAC
activity. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8477–85]

Introduction
Treatment of tumor cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitors (HDACi), drugs that remodel chromatin and thereby
modulate the expression of several genes, has been shown to result
in growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptosis of many cancer
cell lines (1, 2). In contrast, normal cells seem to be relatively
resistant to HDACi both in vitro and in vivo. The basis for the

selective toxicity of HDACi for transformed cells remains unclear.
We previously found that mutations in k-Ras, a common genetic
change in human tumors, sensitize colon cancer cells to butyrate,
an inhibitor of HDAC activity (3). Oncogenic k-Ras has been shown
recently to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, which promotes
its translocation to mitochondria, a central organelle in apoptosis,
and its association with BCL-x, a potent modulator of programmed
cell death (4). In this study, we addressed the significance of
constitutive Ras signaling, and Ras downstream target genes, in the
responsiveness of colon cancer cells to HDACi.
We reported earlier that a subset of colon cancer cell lines that
harbor mutant k-Ras has reduced expression of signal transducers
and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and of STAT1 target
genes and showed that targeted deletion of the mutant Ras allele in
HCT116 cells was sufficient to restore the expression of STAT1 (5).
We showed that expression of mutant Ras inhibited the basal
activity of the STAT1-driven reporter gene and markedly inhibited
its responsiveness to IFN-g (5), showing that activated Ras
interferes with STAT1-dependent transcription. This is likely to
underlie the decreased expression of IFN-dependent genes in cells
harboring an activated k-Ras mutation.
Consistent with our results, genome-wide analysis of mast cells
transformed with the H-Ras oncogene revealed strong downregulation of several IFN-inducible genes (6), and constitutive
signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated
protein kinase in cells harboring B-Raf mutations has been shown
to down-regulate Janus-activated kinase/STAT signaling (7). These
findings are significant because, in contrast to STAT3 and STAT5,
which are frequently found constitutively activated in leukemias
and in solid tumors (8, 9), levels of STAT1 are often found reduced
in primary tumors and in established cancer cell lines (5, 10, 11).
Although our data showed that Ras mutations are sufficient to
inhibit STAT1 expression, STAT1 and its target genes have also
been shown to be epigenetically silenced by methylation after
cellular immortalization (10), pointing to multiple mechanisms of
STAT1 down-regulation in transformed cells.
STAT1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of
several genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (12), including the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor
p21, which harbors conserved STAT1-responsive elements in its
promoter region (13). In many cell lines, the ability of STAT1 to
induce the expression of p21 seems to be fundamental for STAT1mediated growth arrest. For example, IFN-g failed to inhibit
growth of STAT1-deficient U3A cells but regained antiproliferative
properties on STAT1 reintroduction (13). In addition, hypermethylation of the STAT-responsive element located within the
CpG island in the p21 promoter was associated both with
decreased constitutive expression of p21 as well as with IFN-g–
induced activation of p21 in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (14).

STAT1-deficient mice are prone to develop epithelial tumors,
confirming the tumor suppressor properties of STAT1 (15), and
we showed that a deficiency in p21 promotes formation of intestinal tumors, initiated by mutation in the APC tumor suppressor
gene (16).
We have shown earlier that colon cancer cell lines that harbor
Ras mutations have reduced levels of STAT1 (5) and that
constitutive Ras signaling modulates the responsiveness of cells
to the chemopreventive agent butyrate (3). In this study, we used
nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) with inducible
expression of oncogenic kRasV12, as well as a colon cancer cell line
with silenced STAT1 expression, to dissect the role of mutant Ras
and STAT1 in the responsiveness of cells to inhibitors of HDAC
activity. We showed that silencing of STAT1 expression, like Ras
mutations, promotes apoptosis in response to inhibitors of HDAC
activity, suggesting that Ras modulates apoptosis, at least in part,
through down-regulation of STAT1 expression.
Inhibitors of HDAC activity are promising chemotherapeutic
compounds and several are in clinical trials for a number of
malignancies (2). An important characteristic of HDACis is that
they induce apoptosis preferentially in transformed cells. Our data
show that mutations in k-Ras and the subsequent down-regulation
of STAT1 and perturbed activation of p21 in STAT1-deficient cells
may constitute the molecular basis for the selectivity of HDACis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and Western blot analysis. The HCT116 colorectal
carcinoma cell line and its clonal derivative HKe-3 that lacks the mutant
k-Ras allele (17) were cultured under standard conditions in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. IEC-iKRas cells, a generous gift from
Raymond DuBois, (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS; stimulation with isopropyl-L-thio-B-Dgalactopyranoside (IPTG; 5 mmol/L) was done for 24 h. Western blot analysis
was done using standard procedures. Briefly, 50 Ag of total cell lysates were
fractionated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature or overnight at 4jC and enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham) was used for visualization of immune complexes.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were grown on chamber slides, serum
starved for 16 h, and either left untreated or treated as indicated. Cells were
fixed in ice-cold methanol-acetic acid solution (95:5, v/v) for 20 min at
20jC. Incubation with antibody that recognizes activated caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling) was done for 1 h at 37jC. Slides were washed with PBS and
incubated with a secondary antirabbit antibody conjugated to FITC for
45 min at 37jC. Samples were examined with a fluorescent microscope
and images were acquired with a SPOT CCD camera and analyzed by
SPOT software.
Transient transfections and reporter gene assays. Cells were transfected with a pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for STAT1 or
IRF1 (Dharmacon) using the calcium phosphate method (ProFection
Mammalian Transfection System, Promega) as we described before (18).
Transient transfection experiments using the 2.4-kb genomic fragment
containing the p21 promoter cloned upstream of the LUC reporter gene (19)
were done in 12-well plates in the presence or absence of STAT1-specific
siRNA.
Apoptosis assay. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) and stained with propidium iodide
(50 Ag/mL) for 4 h at 4jC as described before (20). Samples were filtered
through a nylon mesh (40-Am pore size) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cell cycle distribution and the extent of apoptosis (cells with a sub-G1 DNA
content) were analyzed by the ModFit software. Mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent
dye JC1 (Invitrogen). Cells were stained with 1 Amol/L JC1 for 1 h at 37jC,
washed with PBS, and analyzed by fluorescence in the FL2 channel.

Results
Activation of oncogenic Ras in nontransformed epithelial
cells is sufficient to prime cells to undergo apoptosis in
response to inhibitors of HDAC activity. We recently reported
that the extent of apoptosis in response to butyrate, an inhibitor of
HDAC activity, is increased in colon cancer cell lines that carry
mutant Ras (3). To determine whether oncogenic Ras plays a
general role in apoptosis induced by HDACi, we used nontransformed IEC-iKRas intestinal cells with inducible expression of
oncogenic k-Ras (21). As described for the IEC-iKRas cells (21),
expression of oncogenic Ras by addition of IPTG was extensive and
tightly regulated, and as expected, cells with activated Ras
displayed enhanced proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).
To determine whether induction of oncogenic Ras alters the
response of cells to HDACi, we treated cells with 3 mmol/L butyrate
or 1 Amol/L suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for 24, 48, and
72 h in the presence or absence of IPTG (5 mmol/L). The results
were expressed as growth index, which is the ratio of the number of
cells in treated cultures to the number of control cells. As shown in
Fig. 1A, both butyrate and SAHA induced death preferentially in
cells that were induced with IPTG to express mutant Ras.
Consistent with these data, both SAHA and butyrate inhibit the
proportion of cells in S phase preferentially in cells expressing
oncogenic Ras (Fig. 1B). Induction of Ras also sensitized cells to
apoptosis induced by trichostatin A (TSA) and apicidin, two
structurally unrelated inhibitors of HDAC activity (data not shown).
These findings are consistent with our published report that
HCT116 cells, which harbor an activating mutation in k-Ras,
respond to butyrate with increased apoptosis when compared with
HKh2 and HKe-3 cells, two clones derived from HCT116 cells in
which the mutant Ras allele has been deleted (3). Therefore, our
findings show that activation of Ras during transformation of
colonic epithelial cells is sufficient to sensitize cells to apoptosis
induced by several HDACis.
Because mutant k-Ras has recently been shown to localize to
mitochondria (4), we tested whether the induction of kRasV12
modulates mitochondrial functions, such as the MMP, a key
indicator of cell viability. As shown in Fig. 2A, the induction of
mutant Ras significantly reduced the MMP in IEC-iKRas cells but
not in the parental IEC6 cell line, excluding the possibility that the
decrease in MMP was caused by the addition of IPTG. In addition,
the decrease in the MMP was progressive, becoming apparent only
24 h after addition of IPTG (Fig. 2B), which coincided with the
kinetics of induction of mutant Ras in these cells (data not shown;
ref. 21). Consistently, we showed that HCT116 cells, which carry
mutant Ras, have a lower resting MMP when compared with HKe-3
cells, the isogenic clone with a targeted deletion of the mutant Ras
allele (data not shown).
We next examined whether the presence of oncogenic Ras
perturbs changes in the MMP in response to HDACi in IEC-iKRas
cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment of cells with butyrate or SAHA
increased the MMP in the absence of IPTG but decreased it in cells
induced by IPTG. Because dissipation of the MMP is an initial step
in triggering an apoptotic cascade, this observation directly links
the expression of mutant Ras to the ability of HDACis to induce
apoptosis. Moreover, these data are consistent with our findings
that differences in the intrinsic MMP are linked to the biological
responsiveness of cells to butyrate (22).
Silencing of STAT1 in a colorectal cancer cell line promotes
butyrate-induced apoptosis. We have previously reported that
the expression of STAT1 is reduced in colon cancer cell lines that

harbor oncogenic Ras mutations (5). Using IEC-iKRas cells with
inducible activated Ras (Supplementary Fig. S1), we confirmed
that the inducible expression of mutant Ras by IPTG is sufficient
to down-regulate both basal and IFN-g–inducible STAT1 expression (Fig. 3A). We validated functional Ras signaling on IPTG
induction by showing phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) 1/ERK2 in IPTG-treated cells (Fig. 3B).
These results therefore confirmed that Ras-induced transformation of epithelial cells leads to down-regulation of STAT1 expression, establishing STAT1 as a potentially important effector of Ras
signaling.
To determine whether the reduced levels of STAT1 in Rastransformed cells contribute to their enhanced sensitivity to
butyrate, we silenced STAT1 expression. However, silencing of
STAT1 in IECs was not very efficient and was, in addition, transient,

which did not allow us to use this system to show the role of STAT1
in HDACi-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we silenced STAT1
expression in HKe-3 cells, a cell line derived from HCT116 cells
by targeted deletion of the mutant Ras allele (17). STAT1
expression was silenced by RNA interference using a pool of
siRNAs directed against STAT1 as we described before (23). We
achieved 80% to 90% inhibition of both the basal and IFN-g–
inducible expression of STAT1 at 25 nmol/L STAT1 siRNA (Fig. 4A).
Silencing persisted for at least 136 h (data not shown), which
allowed us to investigate the biological significance of STAT1
deficiency in HKe-3 cells. We showed that silencing of STAT1 in
HKe-3 cells was not sufficient to alter the MMP (Fig. 4B).
Consistent with our data shown in Fig. 2, HCTT16 cells, which
harbor mutant Ras, have lower MMP compared with the HKe-3
cells with targeted deletion of the mutant Ras allele (Fig. 4B),

showing that complex changes on Ras signaling are required to
alter the MMP.
We next compared the extent of butyrate-induced apoptosis in
cells transfected with nontargeted siRNA or siRNA specific for
STAT1. We previously reported that HKe-3 cells are, due to a
targeted deletion of the mutant Ras allele, relatively resistant to
butyrate and that they express relatively high levels of STAT1 (3).
As shown in Fig. 4C and D, silencing of STAT1 was sufficient to
sensitize HKe-3 cells to butyrate-induced apoptosis. These data

suggest that reduced expression of STAT1 in Ras-transformed cells
is at least in part responsible for enhanced apoptosis of these cells
in response to butyrate.
Butyrate, through its ability to induce growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in transformed cells, acts as a physiologic
chemopreventive agent. Next, we determined whether STAT1 also
regulates the responsiveness of cells to an important pharmacologic chemopreventive agent, sulindac. Control cells, or cells
transfected with STAT1 siRNA, were treated with sulindac sulfide

for 24 h and the extent of caspase-3 activation was determined by
immunofluorescence using antibody that specifically recognizes
cleaved, activated caspase-3. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A,
the extent of activation of caspase-3 was significantly higher in
cells with silenced STAT1 expression. Consistently, the amount of
cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a caspase substrate,
was enhanced in STAT1-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
These data established that STAT1 can protect cells from
apoptosis not only in response to HDACi but also to a
pharmacologic inducer of programmed cell death. However, our
data also revealed that silencing of STAT1 is not sufficient to lower
the MMP (Fig. 4B). Therefore, how does STAT1 protect HKe-3 cells
from apoptosis in response to HDACi?
Silencing of STAT1 in HKe-3 cells interferes with induction
of p21 in response to butyrate. p21 is known to play an
important role in butyrate-induced growth arrest as well as in
butyrate-induced apoptosis (24, 25). Because STAT1 has been
shown to regulate transcription of the p21 gene (13), we determined whether STAT1 deficiency perturbs the induction of p21 in
response to butyrate and sulindac sulfide in IECs. HKe-3 cells, in
which the mutated Ras allele has been deleted, have therefore
elevated levels of STAT1 compared with the HCT116 cells, were
transfected with nontargeting siRNA or siRNA specific for STAT1,
and were either left untreated or treated with 3 mmol/L butyrate
or 150 Amol/L sulindac sulfide. The levels of cleaved PARP, a
marker of apoptosis, and the levels of p21 were determined by
immunoblotting 24 and 48 h after treatment. Consistent with
results shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2, STAT1-deficient
cells underwent enhanced apoptosis in response to both butyrate
and sulindac sulfide, as shown by enhanced cleavage of PARP in
cells with silenced expression of STAT1 (Fig. 5A). In addition, we
showed that p21 induction in response to butyrate and sulindac
sulfide was significantly impaired in STAT1-deficient cells, showing

that STAT1 plays a crucial role in p21 induction in response to both
butyrate and sulindac sulfide.
To determine whether STAT1 is required for transcriptional
activation of p21 in response to butyrate, we transfected cells
with a p21 promoter reporter construct in the presence of
nontargeting siRNA or siRNA specific for STAT1. Butyrate induced
the activity of the p21 promoter in a dose-dependent manner, and
we showed that silencing of STAT1 severely impaired the
transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter in response to
butyrate (Fig. 5B). This result established that STAT1 plays an
important role in transcriptional activation of p21 in response to
butyrate.
One of the important downstream effectors of STAT1 is IRF1, a
transcription factor that has been shown to regulate the activity of
the p21 promoter (26) and that is expressed, as we showed, in a
STAT1-dependent manner (23). To determine whether IRF1
mediates the ability of STAT1 to regulate p21, we silenced IRF1
in HKe-3 cells and examined the responsiveness of IRF1-deficient
cells to butyrate. Our data revealed that, in contrast to STAT1,
silencing of IRF1 did not interfere with p21 induction in response
to butyrate (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B) and did not modulate
butyrate-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). These data exclude
the possibility that STAT1 regulates p21 activation through
induction of IRF1 and support our hypothesis that STAT1 may
be a direct regulator of p21 transcription. Indeed, our preliminary
data suggest that overexpression of STAT1 activates p21 promoter
activity (data not shown).
p21 protects cells from apoptosis induced by butyrate and
other inhibitors of HDAC activity. The best understood
biological activity of butyrate is inhibition of HDAC activity (27).
Therefore, we next determined whether two structurally unrelated
inhibitors of HDAC activity, TSA and SAHA, also require STAT1 for
the induction of p21 and whether STAT1 deficiency modulates
their biological activity. Cells were transfected with nontargeting
siRNA or siRNA specific for STAT1 as described earlier and treated
with butyrate (3 mmol/L), TSA (0.5 or 1 Amol/L), or SAHA (1 or
2 Amol/L) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, all three inhibitors of
HDAC activity induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis in
STAT1-deficient cells and they all failed to induce p21 in STAT1deficient cells. In contrast, the levels of another inhibitor of cdk
activity, p27, were not affected by STAT1 deficiency.
These data suggested that STAT1 protects cells from apoptosis
through its ability to contribute to p21 induction in response to
treatment of cells with HDACi. We confirmed the protective role of
p21 by showing that HCT116 cells with deletion of the p21 gene
respond with increased apoptosis to butyrate (Fig. 6B). In contrast,
deficiency in p53 did not affect butyrate-induced apoptosis (data
not shown), excluding the role of p53 in p21 induction.
Altogether, our data suggest that STAT1 protects IECs from
apoptosis through its ability to support p21 induction in response
to a variety of stimuli and that signaling by oncogenic Ras
promotes apoptosis in response to HDACis at least in part through
its down-regulation of STAT1 expression and consequent loss of
p21 induction.

There is growing evidence that epigenetic changes that occur
during transformation are as crucial for the progression of
malignant disease as genetic alterations. Inhibitors of HDAC
activity (HDACi), such as butyrate, TSA, and SAHA, are drugs that

induce histone acetylation, modulate the expression of several
genes, and thereby normalize the epigenetic state in tumor cells.
HDACis exert their potent and selective antineoplastic activity
through their ability to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis of
cancer cells but also through inhibition of angiogenesis, induction
of differentiation, and activation of the host immune response (2).
In addition, HDACis have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory
properties through suppression of important inflammatory cytokines (28) or inhibition of cytokine signaling (29–31) and their
ability to inhibit inflammation is likely to contribute to their
antitumorigenic activity.
Although acetylation of histones is generally thought to
reactivate gene expression, genome-wide expression analysis has
revealed that a comparable number of genes were repressed and
induced in cells that were exposed to structurally unrelated
inhibitors of HDAC activity (1, 32). Another intriguing feature of
HDACi is that, despite the fact that they induce similar hyperacetylation of histones in both normal and tumor cells, HDACis
show remarkable specificity for transformed tumor cells (1, 2). The
molecular basis for this selectivity has not been revealed. For
example, despite the fact that HDACis have been shown to activate
a death receptor pathway in leukemic cells, but not in normal
hematopoietic progenitors, the expression of oncogenic fusion
proteins AML1/ETO and PML/RAR was not sufficient to confer
HDACi sensitivity (33, 34).

Here, we present data that show that inducible expression of
oncogenic kRasV12 in nontransformed IECs significantly lowers
the MMP and that acquisition of the mutant Ras is sufficient to
sensitize cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis.
We identified STAT1 as a downstream target of signaling by
mutant Ras, whose silencing, like activation of oncogenic Ras,
sensitizes cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis. Our work established
that, in STAT1-deficient HKe-3 cells, HDACis failed to induce p21
expression, showing that in these cells STAT1 is required for p21
induction in response to HDACi. STAT1-null mouse embryonal
fibroblasts and STAT1-deficient fibrosarcoma cells exhibit significantly lower expression of p21, showing that STAT1 is required for
basal expression of p21 (35). Likewise, the basal expression of p21
in the intestine of STAT1-deficient mice was lower, and STAT1-null
mice also displayed a lower level of inducible p21 in response to
intestinal injury (36). Another group has recently reported that
oncogenic H-Ras also promotes HDACi-induced apoptosis and
that induction of p21 in response to HDACi is impaired in cells that
harbor mutant H-Ras (37).
Although we showed that the ability of HDACis to activate
transcription of p21 is severely impaired in STAT1-deficient cells,
the mechanism of STAT1-dependent activation of p21 remains to
be established. As we reported in HKe-3 cells, STAT1 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine but not on tyrosine (31). Although
tyrosine phosphorylation remains a principal mechanism whereby

and sulindac sulfide. A, cells, transfected with nontargeting or
STAT1-specific siRNA, were treated with butyrate or sulindac sulfide
(SSD ) as indicated for 24 or 48 h. The amounts of STAT1, cleaved PARP,
and p21 were determined by immunoblotting. NSB, nonspecific band.
B, cells were transfected with a p21 promoter in the presence of
nontargeting or STAT1-specific siRNA and either left untreated or treated
with 0.5 or 2 mmol/L butyrate. Data represent the average of three
independent experiments.

STAT1 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, STAT1 has been
shown to regulate gene expression in its monomeric, unphosphorylated form (38). We showed that treatment of cells with
butyrate results in up-regulation of STAT1 expression (Fig. 5) but
does not modulate the activation of STAT1 (data not shown).
Similarly, phosphorylation of STAT1 has been shown dispensable
for its ability to regulate oxysterol-induced apoptosis via the p21/
caspase-3–dependent pathway (35).
The regulatory region of p21 harbors multiple STAT1-binding
sites (13), suggesting that STAT1 may act as a direct regulator of
p21 transcription in response to HDACi. Transient transfection
studies using a p21 promoter reporter construct have shown that
induction of p21 by TSA requires an Sp1 site located in the p21
promoter region (19, 39). Sp1 and STAT1 have been shown to
physically interact and to synergistically regulate the expression of
the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in response to IFN-g (40).
Whether Sp1 and STAT1 also cooperate in the induction of p21 in
response to treatment with HDACi is not yet resolved.
We showed that both STAT1-deficient and p21-deficient cells
respond to HDACi with an increased extent of apoptosis. We
hypothesize that, in the absence of STAT1, like in the absence of
p21, cells fail to undergo growth arrest in response to HDACis
but are instead driven to apoptosis (Fig. 6C). We showed that the
expression of STAT1 is markedly reduced in IECs on activation of
oncogenic Ras, therefore identifying a biological situation with
perturbed expression of STAT1.
We showed that STAT1 deficiency also interfered with p21
induction in response to camptothecin,3 a commonly used
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent, establishing STAT1
as a transcription factor that plays a critical role in p21 induction

in response to a variety of stimuli. Because we reported that p21
determines the responsiveness of colon cancer cells to camptothecin (41), it is likely that STAT1, like p21, will regulate the
responsiveness of cells to camptothecin. Experiments to address
this question are under way.
STAT1 was cloned as a transcription factor required for signaling
by IFN (42). Its role in apoptosis, however, is not without precedent.
Although STAT1 is required for the basal expression of caspases
(38), we did not observe a significant effect of STAT1 deficiency on
the expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, or caspase-9 in the
HKe-3 cells (data not shown). Elevated levels of STAT1 have been
shown to protect head and neck squamous carcinoma cells from
radiation-induced apoptosis (43), and silencing of STAT1 sensitized
prostate carcinoma cell lines to docetaxel-induced apoptosis (44).
Recently, STAT1 has been shown to be acetylated in cells treated
with HDACi, and its expression was induced selectively in
melanoma cell lines that were sensitive to HDACi (45). In this
report, the authors showed that STAT1 binds to and sequesters the
NF-nB p65 subunit from the nucleus, thereby interfering with the
antiapoptotic activity of NF-nB and consequently sensitizing cells to
HDACi-induced apoptosis (45). It therefore seems that the
interaction of STAT1 with other signaling pathways may dictate
the role of STAT1 in HDACi-induced apoptosis.
In summary, our data provide the mechanistic explanation for
the selective toxicity of HDACi for tumor cells. We have shown that

Figure 6. Induction of p21 in response to HDACis protects cells from apoptosis.
A, HKe-3 cells were transfected with nontargeting or STAT1-specific siRNA and treated
with butyrate, TSA, or SAHA as indicated. The amount of apoptosis was calculated and
the levels of p21 and p27 were determined by immunoblotting. B, the amount of
butyrate-induced apoptosis was determined in HCT116 p21+/+ and HCT116 p21 /
cells as indicated. The experiment was repeated thrice. C, schematic representation of
the role of mutant k-Ras in apoptosis in response to HDACi. WT, wild-type.

the acquisition of oncogenic k-Ras, which occurs in >50% of all
human tumors, is sufficient to sensitize colon cancer cells to
apoptosis in response to HDACi. Furthermore, we identified STAT1
as a downstream target of Ras signaling in HCT116 cells, whose
deregulation is sufficient to confer sensitivity to tumor cells,
through its requirement to support the induction of p21 in response
to HDACis.
