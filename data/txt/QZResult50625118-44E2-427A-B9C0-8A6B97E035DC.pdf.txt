Abstract

Introduction

Metronomic chemotherapy is the frequent administration of
low doses of chemotherapeutic agents targeting tumorassociated endothelial cells. We examined the efficacy of
metronomic taxanes alone and in combination with AEE788—
a dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor—in
an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer. Growthmodulating effects of metronomic and maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) regimens on overall survival were tested in vivo
using both chemotherapy-sensitive (HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1)
and chemotherapy-resistant (HeyA8-MDR) models. Treated
tumors were stained for microvessel density (CD31), proliferation index (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and apoptosis
(terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end
labeling). The cytotoxic effects of MTD and metronomic
dosing were tested with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Effects of metronomic regimens
on circulating endothelial precursors (CEP) and tumor-specific
cell-free DNA levels were assessed. In vivo, metronomic
docetaxel resulted in significant reduction of tumor growth in
the taxane-sensitive cell lines, whereas metronomic docetaxel
plus AEE788 had an additive effect resulting in significant
prolongation in survival. Combination therapy was effective
even in the taxane-resistant model. Metronomic chemotherapy
alone and combined with AEE788 resulted in a decrease in the
proliferative index and microvessel density of treated tumors,
whereas combination therapy increased the apoptotic index
(P < 0.001). In vitro, metronomic taxanes caused endothelial
cell toxicity at 10- to 100-fold lower concentrations compared
with MTD dosing. Metronomic regimens inhibited mobilization
of CEPs (P < 0.05) and led to a decrease in cell-free DNA levels
(P < 0.05). Our results suggest that metronomic taxane
chemotherapy with dual EGFR and VEGFR inhibition is highly
efficacious and should be considered for future clinical trials.

Ovarian cancer remains the most common cause of death from a
gynecologic malignancy, with over 15,000 deaths per year (1). Thus,
better treatment strategies are necessary to improve the outcome
of this deadly disease. Following cytoreductive surgery, chemotherapy has been the mainstay of ovarian cancer treatment for
many years (2). Traditional dosing of chemotherapy is based on
short bursts of the maximum tolerated doses (MTD), which targets
proliferating tumor cells (3). In an effort to balance toxicity with
efficacy, a conventional dosing schedule calls for episodic
administration of a cytotoxic drug at or near the MTD, followed
by periods of rest to allow normal tissues to recover. However,
growing evidence suggests that metronomic delivery or frequent
administration of drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, vinblastine,
and taxanes, at doses much lower than the MTD, have
antiangiogenic properties and may be more effective (4, 5). The
rationale for this approach is that shortening the time between
cycles prevents effective recovery of the damaged tumor vasculature (4, 5). This implies that activated tumor vascular endothelial
cells may be more sensitive to lower doses of chemotherapeutic
drugs compared with normal or cancer cells, when exposed in a
frequent or continuous manner (5). Thus, metronomic dosing of
standard chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in combination
with other antivascular agents, could maximize the growth-limiting
effects on the tumor vasculature, providing a means to overcome
resistance encountered with cytotoxic agents administered using
traditional dosing schedules (6). Additionally, metronomic chemotherapeutic regimens deliver substantially lower cumulative doses
of cytotoxic agents, thereby decreasing potential side effects and
improving patient tolerance (7).
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and metastatic
spread of tumors (8). VEGF is a key angiogenic factor and
its effects are mediated by two high-affinity transmembrane
tyrosine kinase receptors [vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) receptor (VEGFR)-1 and VEGFR-2] that are expressed on
vascular endothelium (9–11). Overexpression of VEGF in tumor
cells enhances tumor growth and metastasis in several animal
models by stimulating vascularization. Therapeutic targeting of
angiogenesis is starting to show promise, as shown by the recent
Food and Drug Administration approval of an anti-VEGF antibody,
bevacizumab (12). The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its
receptor (EGFR) also play a critical role in the progression of
ovarian cancer (13, 14). We have recently shown that inhibition of
EGFR and VEGFR phosphorylation using AEE788 (Novartis, East

or (e) docetaxel (5 mg/kg). The 5 mg/kg thrice weekly dose was chosen as the
highest dose so that the cumulative metronomic dose would be equal to
previously reported MTD for docetaxel (15–20 mg/kg; ref. 17).
For long-term experiments to assess tumor growth, therapy began 1 week
after tumor cell injection. Therapy consisted of six groups: (a) PBS, (b) MTD
docetaxel (15 mg/kg every 2 weeks; ref. 17), (c) metronomic docetaxel
(0.5 mg/kg thrice weekly), (d) AEE788 (50 mg/kg p.o. thrice weekly; ref. 15),
(e) MTD docetaxel plus AEE788, or (e) metronomic docetaxel plus AEE788.
Mice were monitored for adverse effects, and tumors were harvested after
3 to 4 weeks of therapy. If animals in any group began to seem moribund and
required sacrifice, all animals in the experiment were sacrificed together.
Mouse weight, tumor weight, and distribution of tumor were recorded.
Tissue specimens were fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding and frozen
in optimum cutting temperature medium for frozen slide preparation.
Additional survival experiments were also done, which were initiated either
1 week or 17 days after tumor cell injection. Mice were treated as described
above and individually killed when moribund (unable to move or reach
food). The date of death was recorded as the day a mouse was sacrificed.
For assessment of biomarkers, mice with established tumors (17 days
after tumor cell injection) were treated with the following regimens:
(a) MTD docetaxel, (b) metronomic docetaxel, (c) MTD docetaxel plus
AEE788, and (d) metronomic docetaxel plus AEE788 for 7 days.
Collection of blood and extraction of plasma. For collection of blood,
mice were anesthetized using nembutal (0.1 mL/g of body weight) by i.p.
injection. Approximately 1 mL of blood was collected by retro-orbital
puncture in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Blood was kept at
4jC on ice until 150 AL of blood were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry
to quantify circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Next, the remaining blood
was subjected to two consecutive centrifugations at 1,200  g for 10 min
each at room temperature to extract the plasma and remove the cellular
component. Plasma aliquots were stored at 80jC until further use.
Immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, CD31,
and terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end
labeling. For immunohistochemical analysis, paraffin-embedded tissues
were sectioned (5-Am-thick) and used to detect expression of proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–
mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Frozen sections were used for
detecting CD31. Generally, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were
deparaffinized by sequential washing with xylene, 100% ethanol, 95%
ethanol, 80% ethanol, and PBS. After antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxide
was blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 5 min. After PBS washes, slides
were blocked with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum in
PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary
antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4jC. Next, the appropriate
secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in blocking
solution was added for 1 h at room temperature. HRP was detected
with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Phoenix Biotechnologies, Huntsville, AL)
substrate for 5 min, washed, and counterstained with Gil no. 3 hematoxylin
(Sigma). Primary antibodies used included anti-CD31 (platelet/endothelial
cell adhesion molecule 1, rat IgG; PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and antiPCNA (PC-10, mouse IgG; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), using the appropriate
secondary HRP-conjugated antibody; followed by development with DAB
(no biotin/streptavidin system was needed for these antigens). Antigen
retrieval for studies on paraffin-embedded slides was done by microwave
heating for 5 min in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0; for PCNA). After
endogenous peroxidase block, these slides were incubated with 0.13 Ag/mL
mouse IgG Fc blocker (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) for
2 h before primary antibody incubation. Immunohistochemistry for CD31
was done on freshly cut frozen tissue. These slides were fixed in cold
acetone for 10 min and did not require antigen retrieval. For TUNEL
staining, after deparaffinizing, samples were treated with proteinase K
(1:500 dilution) and rinsed with distilled water. One set of slides was treated
with DNase 1:50 dilution as a positive control. Samples were incubated with
terminal 1:400 and biotin-16-dUTP 1:200 in terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase buffer at 37jC for 1 h and then incubated with 2% bovine serum
albumin/normal horse serum in double-distilled water. Samples were
incubated with peroxidase streptavidin 1:400 in house detection diluent at

Hanover, NJ) has potent efficacy in a murine model of ovarian
cancer (15). We hypothesized that metronomic chemotherapy will
have at least equal therapeutic efficacy compared with MTD
dosing, alone and in combination with dual inhibition of EGFR and
VEGFR phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, metronomic
taxanes and AEE788 were tested individually and in combination
using an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. The ovarian cancer cell lines HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1
(15) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 0.1% gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas,
CA). The SKOV3ip1 variant was derived from ascites arising in a nude mouse
given an i.p. injection of SKOV3 cells (15). Additionally, the HeyA8-MDR cell
line, a taxane-resistant line generated by sequential exposure to increasing
concentrations of paclitaxel, was a kind gift of Dr. Isaiah J. Fidler (Department
of Cancer Biology, U.T.M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and
maintained in the above medium with 300 Ag/mL paclitaxel. Endothelial cells
isolated from the mesentery or ovary [mouse mammary epithelial cells
(MMEC)] of the immortomouse were a kind gift of Dr. Robert Langley
(Department of Cancer Biology, U.T.M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX; ref. 16) and were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. MMEC cells have
the capacity to proliferate indefinitely by means of SV40 transformation at
33jC. However, when switched to 37jC, SV40 expression is turned off and
cells proliferate for only a few more cycles. When using these cells, they were
kept at 37jC for 48 h before any experiments were done to allow elimination
of SV40 expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) cells
were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10% basic fibroblast growth
factor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All in vitro experiments were conducted
at 60% to 80% confluence. For in vivo injection, cells were trypsinized and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 7 min at 4jC, washed twice, and reconstituted in
HBSS (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at a concentration of 5  106/mL
(SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 MDR) or 1.25  106/mL (HeyA8) in 200 AL i.p.
injections.
Cell viability assay. To determine the sensitivity of both ovarian cancer
cells and human and murine endothelial cells to paclitaxel and docetaxel,
2,000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate, and experimental
conditions were set in triplicate. To assess viability with MTD and
metronomic paclitaxel and docetaxel, serum-containing growth medium
with varying concentrations of the paclitaxel (0.001–500 nmol/L) or
docetaxel (0.001–100 nmol/L) were used. For metronomic treatment,
medium containing the drug was changed daily. The number of viable cells
was assessed 5 days after drug exposure for HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 and
9 days for HUVEC and MMEC. To assess viability, 50 AL of 0.15%
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) were added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at 37jC, the
medium/MTT was removed, and cells were reconstituted in 100 AL DMSO
(Sigma). After shaking, the absorbance at 570 nm was recorded using a
FALCON microplate reader (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
The IC50 was determined by calculating the mean absorbance at 570 nm
[(max absorbance  min absorbance) / 2 + min absorbance] and finding the
paclitaxel and docetaxel concentration at which this absorbance reading
intersected with the dose-response curve.
Orthotopic in vivo model and tissue collection. Female athymic
nude mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Cancer Research and Development Center (Frederick, MD) and housed in
specific pathogen-free conditions. They were cared for in accordance
with guidelines set forth by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care and the USPHS Policy on Human Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, and all studies were approved and supervised by the
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
To determine the optimal metronomic dose of docetaxel, therapy with
different doses was initiated 1 week after tumor cell injection. Mice were
treated thrice a week with i.p. injections of the following agents: (a) PBS, (b)
docetaxel (0.5 mg/kg), (c) docetaxel (1 mg/kg), (d) docetaxel (2.5 mg/kg),

volume of DNA used per PCR reaction (5 AL), and V ext is the volume of plasma
used to extract DNA (200 AL). All reactions were done in triplicate and values
represent the mean of these determinations.
Statistics. Continuous variables were compared with the Student’s t test
(between two groups) or ANOVA ( for all groups) if normally distributed,
and the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test ( for all groups)
if nonparametric. Pairwise differences in normally distributed variables in
our treatment groups were compared by the Tukey-Kramer statistic
for multiple comparisons. A Bonferoni adjustment to a (default value 0.05)
was made based on the number of pairwise comparisons within a treatment
experiment using the formula: a(a) = 0.05/k, where k = number of
comparisons against control. For in vivo therapy experiments, 10 mice in
each group were used, as directed by a power analysis to detect a 50%
reduction in tumor size (h-error 0.2). Survival curves were plotted by
the method of Kaplan and Meier and tested for survival differences with the
log-rank statistic. A P < 0.05 on two-tailed testing was considered
significant.

37jC for 40 min. A positive reaction was indicated by a reddish-brown
precipitate in the nucleus. Images were captured with the use of a threechip camera (Sony Corporation of America, Montvale, NJ) and Optimas
Image Analysis software (Bioscan, Edmond, WA).
Staining for PCNA, CD31, and TUNEL was conducted on tumors
collected at the conclusion of 4-week therapy trials. For quantification of
PCNA or TUNEL expression, the number of PCNA- or TUNEL-positive and
total tumor cells were counted in 10 random fields at 100 magnification.
To quantify microvessel density, microvessel-like structures consisting of
endothelial cells that were stained with the anti-CD31 antibody were
counted in similar fields.
Flow cytometry analysis of CECs. CECs in peripheral blood were
evaluated using three- or four-color flow cytometry as previously described
(18, 19). Red cell lysis was done using FACSLyse solution (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following
directly conjugated antibodies were used to detect CECs and circulating
endothelial precursors (CEP) in murine peripheral blood: anti-mouse CD45PerCP, Flk-1-PE (mouse VEGFR-2), CD31-APC (platelet/endothelial adhesion molecule-1), and CD117-FITC (c-kit receptor; all from BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometry was done using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and acquired
data were analyzed with FLOWJO flow cytometry analysis software
(Treestar, Ashland, OR). Analysis gates were designed to remove any
residual platelets and cellular debris. Between 50,000 and 100,000 events
were typically counted for each animal. MS-1 cells, a transformed murine
endothelial cell line, was added to the blood samples as a positive control.
For comparison of CECs, the number of mature CECs or CEPs detected
for each mouse were expressed as a percentage of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells detected for that mouse. Mean CEC and CEP values per
microliter of blood for each treatment group were then calculated and
compared with control mice.
Plasma DNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma DNA
was extracted from 200 AL of plasma using the QIAamp Blood Mini kit
(Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Carrier RNA
(5 AL) was added to each plasma sample before DNA extraction. DNA was
eluted in 25 AL AE buffer and stored at 20jC until further use.
Quantification of tumor-specific plasma DNA was done as previously
described (20). A standard curve consisting of known concentrations of
human genomic DNA was created to quantify the number of genome
equivalents (GE) per milliliter in each of the unknown samples. The assay was
linear at least over 5 orders of magnitude. Primers directed toward human
b-actin gene with no cross-reaction with murine sequences were used
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The DNA concentration, expressed in
copies or GE/mL, was calculated with the following equation (20, 21):

Results
Determining the optimal metronomic dose for docetaxel.
Due to a paucity of data regarding the optimal in vivo metronomic
dose for docetaxel, we first did dose-finding experiments. Female
nude mice (n = 10 in each group) injected with HeyA8 cells i.p.
were treated with either vehicle or docetaxel at doses ranging from
0.5 to 5 mg/kg i.p. thrice weekly, starting at 1 week after tumor cell
injection. All metronomic doses of docetaxel were highly effective
in reducing tumor growth (Fig. 1). The lowest dose of metronomic
docetaxel (0.5 mg/kg) resulted in an 87% reduction in mean tumor
weight compared with controls (P < 0.05). Doses lower than 0.5
mg/kg were not effective (data not shown). Therefore, we selected
0.5 mg/kg docetaxel thrice weekly as the optimal metronomic dose,
which was used for all subsequent experiments.
Long-term therapy with metronomic docetaxel. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of metronomic docetaxel alone and
in combination with AEE788, we initiated therapy 1 week after
tumor cell injection according to the following six groups (10 mice
per group): (a) PBS, thrice weekly; (b) MTD docetaxel 15 mg/kg,
every 2 weeks; (c) metronomic docetaxel 0.5 mg/kg thrice weekly;
(d) AEE788 50 mg/kg by p.o. gavage thrice weekly; (e) MTD
docetaxel plus AEE788; and ( f ) metronomic docetaxel plus AEE788.
In the HeyA8 model, both MTD and metronomic docetaxel
monotherapy led to a 65% and 76% reduction in tumor growth,
respectively, compared with PBS treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A
and B). Similar results were observed with AEE788 alone.
Combination therapy of MTD docetaxel with AEE788 resulted in
an 89% reduction in tumor growth compared with PBS alone

paclitaxel and AEE788 was superior to both PBS and metronomic
docetaxel alone (P = 0.02), with an 80% reduction in tumor growth.
Effect of long-term metronomic therapy on survival in
ovarian cancer. Based on these encouraging results with regard to
inhibition of in vivo tumor growth using metronomic regimens, we
next examined the effects of these regimens on survival using the
HeyA8 model. Treatment with MTD (P = 0.03) and metronomic
docetaxel (P = 0.002) both significantly prolonged survival, whereas
AEE788 alone did not have a significant effect (P = 0.09). The most
significant effect on survival time was in the combination arm with
metronomic docetaxel and AEE788, where survival was increased by
at least 60 days (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A). After 100 days, the remaining
mice were sacrificed. Overall, the difference in survival among
the various treatment arms was highly significant (log-rank test,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference in mean
body weight of the mice in the various treatment groups (data not
shown), suggesting that treatment was well tolerated.
Patients with recurrent or chemorefractory disease frequently
have large tumors at the initiation of therapy. To examine the
efficacy of metronomic therapy in the presence of established

(P < 0.01). However, metronomic docetaxel with AEE788 resulted in
the greatest efficacy with 96% tumor growth inhibition
(P < 0.001). Similar results were observed in the SKOV3ip1 model,
with the greatest efficacy noted in the metronomic docetaxel plus
AEE788 group (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C and D). In both experiments, there
was no significant difference in the average mouse weights among
the various treatment groups (data not shown).
Despite surgery and chemotherapy, most patients with advanced
ovarian cancer eventually develop resistance to conventional
chemotherapy. To study the potential efficacy of metronomic
dosing in experimental models of chemotherapy resistance, we
used the taxane-resistant HeyA8-MDR cell line. As expected, there
was no effect on tumor growth with MTD docetaxel in the HeyA8MDR model. Interestingly, metronomic docetaxel monotherapy
resulted in a 57% reduction of tumor growth compared with the
PBS group (P < 0.05; Fig. 2E and F). Furthermore, the combination
of either MTD (P < 0.01) or metronomic docetaxel (P < 0.001) with
AEE788 was superior to the control arm. Similar effects on tumor
inhibition were observed with metronomic paclitaxel therapy
(Fig. 2G and H). In addition, the combination of metronomic

Figure 3. Survival of mice treated with MTD and metronomic docetaxel alone and in combination with AEE788. Nude mice (n = 10 per group) were injected with HeyA8
cells and subsequently randomized into the different treatment regimens. Treatment was continued until mice were individually moribund, and days of life were
recorded. Treatment was initiated 7 d (A ) or 17 d (B) after tumor cell injection after development of clinically detectable tumors (by palpation). Survival data were
compared for significance with the log-rank statistic. Treatment groups are PBS (blue line ); MTD docetaxel 15 mg/kg every 2 wks (green line ); metronomic docetaxel
0.5 mg/kg thrice a week (brown line ); AEE788 50 mg/kg p.o. thrice weekly (purple line ); MTD docetaxel plus AEE788 (black line ); or metronomic docetaxel plus
AEE788 (red line ).

Because the combination of metronomic docetaxel with AEE788
resulted in significantly lower microvessel density, we next
analyzed the effects of these regimens on the rate of tumor cell
apoptosis by the TUNEL method. There was a moderate increase in
apoptosis in the monotherapy groups, but a significant increase in
tumor cell apoptosis was noted in both of the combination groups
(both P < 0.01; Fig. 4). These results indicate that the addition of
AEE788 to MTD and metronomic docetaxel has an additive effect
on treatment-induced apoptosis in tumor cells.
Assessment of CECs and cell-free DNA levels. Antiangiogenic
agents have been shown to have differential effects on the levels of
CECs in the circulation (22). Therefore, we sought to determine the
levels of two subpopulations of CECs, namely CEP cells and mature
CECs, following short-term treatment of mice with metronomic
docetaxel alone and in combination with AEE788, as potential
surrogate biomarkers of response. Mice (n = 8 per group) bearing
HeyA8 tumors were treated (starting at day 17) for 1 week with
either PBS, metronomic docetaxel alone, or in combination with
AEE788; levels of CECs were assessed using flow cytometry on
murine peripheral blood with a modified protocol as previously
described (22). There was no significant difference in the levels of
mature CECs in the various treatment groups (Fig. 5A). Treatment
with AEE788 resulted in a 69% reduction in CEPs compared with
controls (P = 0.06). Interestingly, the combination of AEE788 with

tumors, we conducted a survival experiment with the HeyA8 model
where therapy was initiated 17 days after injection (palpable
tumors of 0.5–0.75 cm3). Combination therapy with metronomic
docetaxel and AEE788 significantly prolonged survival even in this
model (Fig. 3B; P < 0.0001).
Effect of metronomic chemotherapy on tumor cell and
endothelial cell survival in vitro. To test whether metronomic
administration of taxanes has differential effects on tumor cell and
endothelial cell survival compared with MTD dosing, we analyzed
both tumor cells (HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1) and endothelial cells
(HUVEC and MMEC) in vitro using MTT assays. The IC50 levels of
MTD and metronomically administered paclitaxel and docetaxel
are shown in Table 1. Although IC50 levels of MTD (4–5 nmol/L)
and metronomic taxanes (2–3 nmol/L) were not significantly
different in the tumor cells, metronomic treatment with both drugs
resulted in endothelial cell toxicity at substantially lower (10- to
100-fold) levels (IC50 0.05–0.1 nmol/L) compared with MTD dosing
(IC50 1.6–5 nmol/L) in vitro.
Effect of metronomic chemotherapy therapy on proliferation, microvessel density, and apoptosis in vivo. To determine
the effect of therapy on proliferative index, tumors were subjected
to immunohistochemistry for PCNA. Both MTD and metronomic
docetaxel alone each significantly reduced proliferation (P < 0.001
for both; Fig. 4). Tumors treated with a combination of AEE788 plus
MTD docetaxel (P < 0.001) or metronomic docetaxel (proliferation
rate 18.8%; P < 0.001) had a lower proliferative index compared
with controls or chemotherapy-alone groups.
Given the limited effect of metronomic chemotherapy on tumor
cell viability in vitro, a likely explanation for the efficacy of
metronomic dosing on tumor growth is that these effects are
secondary to effects on the tumor-associated vasculature (7). To
test this hypothesis, microvessel density was counted for each
experimental group (Fig. 4). The microvessel density of MTDtreated tumors was similar to controls, but the microvessel density
was significantly lower in tumors from the metronomic group (44%
reduction compared with PBS; P < 0.001). However, the combination of AEE788 with metronomic docetaxel had an even more
profound effect on tumor vasculature (73% reduction compared
with controls, P < 0.001, and 40% reduction over metronomic
docetaxel alone, P < 0.01; Fig. 4). Thus, the combination of
metronomic therapy with AEE788 had an additive effect on
microvessel density as well as the proliferative index of tumor cells.

Discussion

metronomic docetaxel led to a 76% reduction in CEP levels
(P = 0.03). Thus, treatment with AEE788 alone and in combination
with metronomic docetaxel inhibited the mobilization of CEPs,
which could, in part, contribute to their antiangiogenic effects.
Recent studies suggest that circulating cell-free DNA levels may
be a useful biomarker of therapeutic response (23, 24). To evaluate
the usefulness of plasma cell-free DNA as a biomarker of response,
we quantified the levels of tumor-derived plasma DNA levels by
real-time PCR using h-actin primers directed specifically to human
sequences. The mean tumor-derived cell-free DNA levels in
controls was 356.6 GE/mL. Short-term treatment with metronomic
docetaxel and AEE788 resulted in a 47% and 31% reduction in cellfree DNA levels, but this was not statistically significant (Fig. 5B).
Combination therapy with metronomic docetaxel and AEE788 led
to a 73% reduction in cell-free DNA levels (P = 0.04). Furthermore,
there was a close correlation between tumor weights and cell-free
DNA levels (r = 0.8, P < 0.01; Fig. 5C).

These data show that metronomic scheduling of taxane-based
chemotherapy enhances the efficacy of antivascular agents such as
AEE788. These effects were seen at remarkably low cumulative
doses of docetaxel compared with MTD doses and were well
tolerated. The combination of metronomic chemotherapy with
AEE788 significantly prolonged survival. More importantly, this
combination regimen had efficacy even in models with established
tumors as well as in the chemotherapy-resistant model.
The evolution toward metronomic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs is based on several factors. First, high-dose chemotherapy is not very effective and is associated with high toxicity (25).
In addition, dose-dense chemotherapy, in which one or more
chemotherapeutic agent is administered at more frequent intervals,
has shown efficacy in randomized phase III clinical trials (7, 26, 27).
Metronomic chemotherapy, a variant of dose-dense therapy, in
which the cumulative dose is significantly less than MTD-based

Metronomic Chemotherapy in Ovarian Cancer

The clinical testing of antiangiogenic regimens is hampered by
the lack of surrogate biomarkers for identifying patients most likely
to benefit from these agents (38). Such biomarkers are essential as
conventional imaging techniques to assess response may not
accurately reflect the biological effectiveness of these drugs.
Metronomic regimens have an inhibitory effect on the mobilization
and viability of bone marrow–derived CEP cells (19, 39). It is
thought that these cells are mobilized from the bone marrow in
response to growth factors such as VEGF, then migrate to sites of
ongoing angiogenesis and differentiate into mature endothelial cells
(40). Bertolini et al. (19) showed that MTD-cyclophosphamide
regimens caused a sharp decline in CEPs following therapy, but
these cells quickly increased during the drug-free period. In
contrast, with metronomic cyclophosphamide, there was a
sustained suppression of CEPs along with a decrease in viability.
In the current study, metronomic regimens did not have any effect
on the levels of mature CECs, derived primarily from mature
vasculature (40, 41), but the combination of metronomic docetaxel
with AEE788 caused a significant reduction of CEPs, suggesting that
CEP levels could be used to monitor therapeutic response. Because
combination of metronomic therapy with AEE788 results in tumor
cell apoptosis, we also tested the use of tumor-derived cell-free DNA
as a potential biomarker of both tumor burden and response to
therapy. Although both AEE788 and metronomic docetaxel resulted
in a decrease in levels of cell-free DNA, the maximal reduction was
seen in the combination group. The presence of tumor-specific
alterations in plasma DNA has been reported in several studies.
Point mutations in KRAS oncogene have been detected in the
plasma DNA of patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, even
preceding clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer by 5 to 14 months
(42, 43). Wei et al. (24) did quantitative analysis of tumor-specific
EBV DNA in the plasma of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and
found that surgical resection of the tumor was associated with a
significant decrease in EBV DNA copy numbers. Furthermore,
absence of EBV DNA in plasma reflected complete surgical
resection in these patients (24). Our data indicate that tumorderived cell-free DNA levels correlate with tumor weight and could
be a surrogate measure for tumor burden in clinical trials.
In summary, we have shown the efficacy of metronomic
docetaxel, at the optimal metronomic dose, to inhibit tumor
growth and prolong survival using an orthotopic ovarian cancer
model. Furthermore, metronomic docetaxel significantly enhanced
the growth-inhibitory effects of AEE788. These effects were evident
both in mice with established tumors as well as those with taxaneresistant disease. These effects seem to be mediated in part by
antivascular, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects of the metronomic regimens alone and in combination with AEE788. Both
assessment of CEPs and tumor-derived cell-free DNA levels hold
promise as noninvasive biomarkers of therapeutic response. Our
data suggest that the combination of metronomic docetaxel with
dual inhibition of VEGFR and EGFR is highly efficacious and
should be considered for future clinical trials.

chemotherapy, has several potential advantages, including lower
toxicity and adverse side effects (7, 28). More importantly, it seems
that despite the lower cumulative doses administered, metronomic
chemotherapy is superior to MTD-based regimens for inhibiting
tumor growth in preclinical models (29, 30). Our findings show that
metronomic docetaxel at one fifth the cumulative dose of MTDbased regimens had significant effects on therapeutic response and
survival. Clinically, weekly taxane chemotherapy has resulted in a
high rate of objective responses even in chemotherapy-resistant
cancers (31, 32). Our data support these findings in that
metronomic paclitaxel and docetaxel monotherapy resulted in
growth inhibition in the taxane-resistant model.
An attractive application of metronomic chemotherapy is the
ability to combine these regimens with biological agents, in
particular antiangiogenic drugs. Certain chemotherapeutic agents,
such as vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes, have antiangiogenic properties at 1/10 to 1/20 the MTD in combination with
an anti-VEGF-R2 antibody (5, 7, 33). Such combinations are
particularly appealing because high local concentrations of VEGF
in the tumor environment can promote multidrug resistance in
tumor endothelium (6, 7, 34). Hurwitz et al. (12) reported that
bevacizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF)
combined with standard chemotherapy regimens significantly
improved survival for patients with advanced-stage metastatic
colorectal carcinoma. These benefits may extend to the combination of antiangiogenic agents with metronomic regimens of
cytotoxic agents. Theoretically, these combinations would have a
more tolerable toxicity profile and could potentially be administered for prolonged periods. In our study, metronomic docetaxel
plus AEE788 led to a substantial tumor reduction over metronomic
chemotherapy alone, as well as a significant prolongation in
survival of mice with established tumors. Thus, metronomic
chemotherapy with dual inhibition of both VEGFR and EGFR
signaling with AEE788 targets both tumor cells and tumorassociated endothelial cells and results in a profound effect on
tumor growth inhibition.
Most cytotoxic chemotherapy agents cause disruption of cell
division but also damage normally dividing cells of rapidly
regenerating tissues, leading to the well-known side effects of
MTD-based regimens. Although chemotherapeutic agents also
exert their cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells, the long drug-free
periods between treatments provide time for endothelial cells to
repopulate, thereby reducing the antiangiogenic effects of these
drugs. There is increasing evidence, mostly in vitro, which indicates
that endothelial cells are sensitive to very low doses of various
chemotherapeutic drugs (35, 36). Our findings also suggest that
endothelial cells are highly sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel at
10 to 100 times lower cytotoxic doses compared with tumor cells
when administered metronomically. Our in vitro findings do not
support a significant effect of metronomic dosing on tumor cell
survival and proliferation compared with MTD regimens. However,
we found a significant decrease in the percentage of proliferating
tumor cells in vivo in the group treated with metronomic docetaxel
with AEE788. Additionally, whereas metronomic docetaxel alone
did not result in enhanced tumor cell apoptosis, the combination
of metronomic docetaxel with AEE788 had a significant effect on
the apoptotic index of treated tumors. These effects are most likely
secondary to the antivascular effects of the metronomic combination group. Recent studies also suggest thrombospondin 1, a known
inhibitor of angiogenesis, as a potential mediator of the effects of
metronomic chemotherapy (37).
