Abstract
Vitamin C is an antioxidant vitamin that has been hypothesized to antagonize the effects of reactive oxygen species–
generating antineoplastic drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of
the widely used antineoplastic drugs doxorubicin, cisplatin,
vincristine, methotrexate, and imatinib were compared in
leukemia (K562) and lymphoma (RL) cell lines with and
without pretreatment with dehydroascorbic acid, the commonly transported form of vitamin C. The effect of vitamin C
on viability, clonogenicity, apoptosis, P-glycoprotein, reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential
was determined. Pretreatment with vitamin C caused a dosedependent attenuation of cytotoxicity, as measured by trypan
blue exclusion and colony formation after treatment with all
antineoplastic agents tested. Vitamin C given before doxorubicin treatment led to a substantial reduction of therapeutic
efficacy in mice with RL cell–derived xenogeneic tumors.
Vitamin C treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in
apoptosis in cells treated with the antineoplastic agents that
was not due to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein or vitamin C
retention modulated by antineoplastics. Vitamin C had only
modest effects on intracellular ROS and a more general
cytoprotective profile than N-acetylcysteine, suggesting a
mechanism of action that is not mediated by ROS. All
antineoplastic agents tested caused mitochondrial membrane
depolarization that was inhibited by vitamin C. These findings
indicate that vitamin C given before mechanistically dissimilar antineoplastic agents antagonizes therapeutic efficacy
in a model of human hematopoietic cancers by preserving
mitochondrial membrane potential. These results support the
hypothesis that vitamin C supplementation during cancer
treatment may detrimentally affect therapeutic response.

Introduction
The effects of vitamin C on cancer and its treatment are
controversial (1, 2). Clinical studies suggesting a therapeutic benefit
of vitamin C supplementation in patients with cancer have not
been consistently reproducible (2, 3). Nonetheless, vitamin C,
predominantly in the form of ascorbic acid, remains a commonly
used nutritional supplement, and the influence of vitamin C on the

action of agents used in treating cancer is unknown. Some
antineoplastic agents, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, lead to
increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may
contribute to their therapeutic effect (4, 5). Vitamin C is a potent
antioxidant, raising the theoretical concern that vitamin C
supplementation might attenuate the antineoplastic activity of
drugs that lead to increased ROS (2). Conversely, some reports have
suggested that vitamin C might potentiate the effects of some
antineoplastic agents, such as arsenic trioxide (6, 7). In the case of
arsenic trioxide, however, the enhanced cytotoxicity by vitamin C
may be due to the extracellular generation of hydrogen peroxide
and increased intracellular concentrations of vitamin C seem to
attenuate the cytotoxic effects of arsenic (8).
Ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid are the principle
physiologic chemical forms of vitamin C. Whereas ascorbic acid
is present in much higher concentrations in the serum, intracellular transport is restricted to a limited number of tissues (9).
In contrast, dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C,
enters cells via facilitated transport through the glucose transporters, primarily GLUT1, and has a substantially wider distribution (10, 11). After transport, dehydroascorbic acid is reduced to
ascorbic acid and trapped intracellularly (10, 11). This mechanism
leads to rapid and durable accumulation of high concentrations of
intracellular ascorbic acid. In the cell, ascorbic acid and other
intracellular antioxidants, such as glutathione, serve to mitigate the
effects of ROS, function as important biochemical substrates, and
are the first antioxidants consumed in conditions of elevated ROS
(12–14). Ascorbate is also an electron donor for eight different
enzymes and thereby plays an important role in a wide variety of
biochemical processes, including collagen formation (15), norepinephrine biosynthesis (16), and mitochondrial fatty acid transport
(17). The mitochondria, in particular, generate ROS as byproducts
of respiration, making the simpler architecture of mitochondrial
DNA and mitochondrial proteins particularly susceptible to
oxidative damage. Vitamin C may, thus, play an important role in
protecting the mitochondria and mitochondrial translation products from ROS (18, 19).
To ascertain the influence of vitamin C on the cytotoxicity of
antineoplastic agents, we used dehydroascorbic acid to increase
intracellular concentrations of vitamin C. When intracellular
vitamin C levels were increased in the myeloblastic chronic
myeloid leukemia cell line K562 and the lymphoma cell line RL, as
well as in mice with RL cell xenografts, the cells and tumors were
more resistant to the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs that
exert their cytotoxic effects through increased ROS, as well as
antineoplastic agents that do not appreciably affect ROS.
Treatment with all of the antineoplastic agents tested led to
mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Pretreatment with vitamin C substantially attenuated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting a mitochondrial site of action.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone
Laboratories), 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 Ag/mL streptomycin (Gemini BioProducts), 25 mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen), and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Invitrogen). RL cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained
in RPMI containing 20% FBS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate with penicillin/
streptomycin, and L-glutamine, as above.
Vitamin C loading and intracellular concentration determination.
Cellular ascorbic acid uptake was determined, as described previously (20).
Briefly, cells were added to incubation buffer containing 3:1 L-ascorbic acid
(Sigma)/L-[14C]ascorbic acid (4 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer) and supplemented
with 20 Amol/L DTT (Sigma) to achieve final concentrations of 0 to
750 Amol/L ascorbic acid and 20 Amol/L DTT. Dehydroascorbic acid was
generated by preincubation of ascorbic acid for 5 min with ascorbate
oxidase (Sigma) at 20 units/Amol L-ascorbate. After incubation for 1 h at
37jC, cell pellets were washed thrice by centrifugation at 600  g in cold
PBS and lysed, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid
scintillation spectrometry. Intracellular volume was estimated by incubating cells with [3H]oxy-methyl-glucose, as described previously (10, 11),
applying a 30% correction for trapped extracytosolic radioactivity (21).
Experiments measuring ascorbic acid retention used the same dehydroascorbic acid loading method cited above, and scintillation spectrometry was
performed on cell pellets washed thrice by centrifugation at 600  g in cold
PBS at each time point after the addition of antineoplastic agents. Residual
ascorbate oxidase does not influence dehydroascorbic acid uptake (22).
Vitamin C uptake was analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis with
GraphPad Prism 5.0a for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Effects of vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine on cell growth and
viability. RL and K562 cells were incubated with 0 to 500 Amol/L
dehydroascorbic acid for 1 h to achieve intracellular concentrations
between 0 and 9 mmol/L and 0 and 18 mmol/L ascorbic acid, respectively.
After loading, cell pellets were washed thrice in PBS and resuspended in
media supplemented with antineoplastic agents at IC75 concentrations and
cultured for up to 48 h. In experiments with N-acetylcysteine, 25 mmol/L

N-acetylcysteine (American Regent) was added with the antineoplastic
agents and remained in culture throughout the course of exposure. Cellular
viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. For colony assays, cells
were treated with dehydroascorbic acid to achieve high intracellular vitamin
C concentrations (K562 [ascorbic acid] = 18 mm, RL [ascorbic acid] = 8.5
mmol/L) and then treated for 48 h with antineoplastic agents, washed
thrice in PBS, and resuspended at equal densities in MethoCult H4100
(StemCell Technologies). Plates were assessed at 14 d for colonies of 50 cells
or greater. The measured IC75 concentrations are as follows: vincristine
sulfate (GensiaSicor Pharma), 500 nmol/L; doxorubicin HCl (Bedford
Labs), 600 nmol/L; methotrexate (Xanodyne Pharmacal), 100 Amol/L; cisplatin (Bristol Labs), 200 Amol/L; imatinib mesylate (kindly provided by
Dr. William Bornmann), 2.25 Amol/L; actinonin (Sigma), 52 Amol/L.
Animals. Fox Chase ICR SCID mice (Taconic) were grafted with 1  107
RL cells via s.c. injection to the right flank. After the development of palpable
tumor (2  2 mm minimum 14 d postengraftment), animals were divided
into cohorts (n = 5) and treated on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 14, 16, 26, and 28 with
vehicle, vitamin C (250 mg/kg dehydroascorbic acid) by tail vein,
doxorubicin (1 mg/kg) i.p. or vitamin C and doxorubicin by the same route
of administration and at the same doses. Dehydroascorbic acid for injection
was generated by incubation of ascorbic acid with ascorbate oxidase (23, 24).
Animals with tumors >2000 mm3 were euthanized, so few animals treated
with vehicle or vitamin C alone were carried beyond 18 d after treatment
induction. Any animals that showed signs of toxicity, either through visual
inspection or as measured by weight loss (>10%), were treated with 100 AL
normal saline s.c. until weight returned to pretreatment levels. All animal
procedures were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. After final tumor dimension measurements, intratumor vitamin
C concentrations were determined 2 h after injection of dehydroascorbic
acid on day 32 by HPLC-ECD with an ESA CoulArray system (ESA) equipped
with a modified C18 column (Phenomenex). Doxorubicin levels were
determined on the tumors of three mice taken from each cohort on day 32,
4 d after the last doxorubicin administration. Tumor samples for vitamin C
and doxorubicin levels were stored at 80jC.
Fluorometric assays. TUNEL reaction mixture (TUNEL enzyme and
TUNEL label, Roche) was added to cells according to the manufacturer’s

5 min at 37jC. Cells were washed thrice in PBS, resuspended in normal

being loaded with vitamin C. After loading, cells were exposed to
antineoplastic agents at IC75 concentrations in media for 6 h at 37jC. All
flow cytometric acquisitions were performed on a BD FACSCalibur system

Results
RL and K562 cells take up only dehydroascorbic acid. Two
cell lines [RL, derived from a patient with transformed B-cell
follicular lymphoma, and K562, derived from a patient with
myeloblastic chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)] were treated
with dehydroascorbic acid and ascorbic acid (Fig. 1). As has been
noted in other hematopoietic cell lines (8, 11), only dehydroascorbic

acid, and not ascorbic acid, was taken up by K562 and RL cells
to any appreciable extent. In each case, the cells accumulated
substantial intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid in a dosedependent manner, achieving intracellular ascorbic acid concentrations up to 8.5 mmol/L in RL and 18 mmol/L in K562 cells
(Fig. 1A and C). The kinetics of dehydroascorbic acid uptake was
typical of other cell lines. Kinetic analysis supported a two-phase
uptake model of dehydroascorbic acid with the initial rate of uptake
thought to correspond to transport through the glucose transporters, and the slower second rate thought to correspond
to the intracellular conversion of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic
acid (Fig. 1B and D; ref. 11).
Vitamin C protects RL and K562 cells from the cytotoxic
effects of antineoplastic agents. To test whether vitamin C
exposure could protect cells from chemotherapeutic agents in
which the generation of ROS is considered to contribute to
cytotoxicity, we used chemotherapeutic agents that act through
various mechanisms: vincristine is a Vinca alkaloid that binds
tubulin and inhibits cell division; doxorubicin is an anthracycline
that intercalates into DNA and also inhibits topoisomerase II;
methotrexate (MTX) inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to
inhibition of DNA synthesis; cisplatin forms DNA cross-link
adducts; imatinib mesylate is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that inhibits bcr-abl, the constitutively activated tryosine kinase
that plays a central pathophysiologic role in CML (25, 26). Although
ROS have been reported to play a role in mediating the therapeutic
cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and doxorubicin (4, 5), they are not
considered to play an important mechanistic role in the efficacy of
the other agents tested.
When cells were exposed to dehydroascorbic acid to increase
intracellular ascorbic acid levels, washed, and subsequently treated
with antineoplastic agents at concentrations corresponding to an
IC75, we found that the cytotoxicity of all agents tested, regardless
of mechanism of action, was reduced (Fig. 2A). The absolute
magnitude of the reductions ranged from 11% (VCR) to 27% (MTX)
and corresponded to relative reduction in cytotoxicity of 30% to
70%. Cytotoxicity was reduced more in cells that had higher
intracellular concentrations of vitamin C, indicating a dosedependent effect. High intracellular concentrations of vitamin C,
however, had no effect on either the viability or proliferation of
untreated cells. RL cells pretreated with vitamin C showed a similar
reduction in chemotherapy-mediated cytotoxicity, with the exception that imatinib was not cytotoxic (Fig. 2B). The lack of imatinib
cytotoxicity was expected because RL cells are not transformed by
the bcr-abl kinase. These findings were broadened to show that
increased intracellular vitamin C also antagonizes the effects of
chemotherapeutic agents, as measured by the ability of drugtreated cells to form colonies in methylcellulose (Fig. 2C). This
indicates that the protection conferred by vitamin C treatment
extends to cells with in vitro clonogenic potential. These results
also show that vitamin C can attenuate the cytotoxicity of
antineoplastic drugs in cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage
and reduces the effectiveness of agents that act through a broad
range of mechanisms.
Vitamin C antagonizes doxorubicin cytotoxicity in murine
RL xenografts. We used RL cells to generate xenograft tumors in
ICR SCID mice to determine whether vitamin C attenuates the
effects of chemotherapy in vivo. As expected, doxorubicin treatment
reduced tumor growth compared with untreated mice (Fig. 3A).
Whereas treatment with dehydroascorbic acid alone did not
appreciably alter tumor growth compared with untreated mice

(P = 0.114), mice treated with dehydroascorbic acid 2 hours before
doxorubicin administration had tumors that were about four times
larger than tumors in mice treated with doxorubicin alone at day
32 (P = 0.01; Fig. 3A and B). At day 32, because mice treated with
dehydroascorbic acid before doxorubicin administration had
average tumor volumes of >2,000 mm3, the animals were sacrificed
to assess intratumor doxorubicin and ascorbic acid levels
coincident with animals treated only with doxorubicin. The
intratumor concentration of vitamin C, in dehydroascorbic acid–

treated animals was 5.5 F 0.9 mmol/L compared with 0.65 F
0.08 mmol/L in vehicle-treated mice, indicating that dehydroascorbic acid treatment effectively increased the intratumor concentration of vitamin C. The doxorubicin concentration in the
tumors of vitamin C–treated mice was 9.8 F 1.1 Agdox/mgtumor. In
the tumors of mice that did not receive vitamin C, the doxorubicin
concentration was 9.9 F 2.0 Agdox/mgtumor. This shows that
dehydroascorbic acid treatment did not alter tumor cell uptake
of doxorubicin. Therefore, vitamin C given before doxorubicin

substantially reduced the effectiveness of treatment and suggests,
in a preclinical model, that vitamin C might interfere with cancer
chemotherapy inside the cell rather than affecting drug clearance
or tumor uptake.
Vitamin C decreases apoptosis but does not affect Pglycoprotein expression. We next investigated the mechanism
by which vitamin C attenuates the cytotoxic effects of antineoplastic agents. Pretreatment of cells with vitamin C led to a dosedependent decrease in apoptosis with all agents tested. At the
highest concentrations of intracellular vitamin C, apoptosis was
reduced between 37% and 82%, as measured by TUNEL (Fig. 4). The
possibility that vitamin C treatment alters the effectiveness of
chemotherapeutic agents by up-regulating the P-glycoprotein (Pgp)
efflux pump was excluded by the finding that Pgp expression on
the cell surface was unaltered by vitamin C treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This result is consistent with our finding that
intratumor doxorubicin concentrations are similar between
untreated mice and mice treated with vitamin C.
Vitamin C elimination kinetics is not affected by treatment
with antineoplastic agents. To determine whether antineoplastic
agents altered the kinetics of vitamin C elimination, K562 and
RL were loaded with L-[14C]ascorbic acid by treatment with
14
L-[ C]dehydroascorbic acid. The intracellular concentration of
14
[ C] in cell pellets was measured over 24 h (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). There was no significant difference in [14C] elimination
with any of the agents tested and untreated control cells. These
findings are consistent with the observation that there was no
difference in vitamin C concentration within the xenogenic tumors
of mice treated with doxorubicin. These results suggest that the
protective effect of vitamin C is not a result of improved antioxidant retention.
Vitamin C treatment results in small reductions in ROS.
When K562 and RL cells were treated with antineoplastic agents,
we found that doxorubicin and, to a lesser extent, cisplatin
increased the intracellular levels of ROS, as has been previously
reported (4, 5), whereas other agents had little discernible effect on
ROS levels (Fig. 5A). In cells treated with chemotherapeutic drugs,
as well as in untreated cells, pretreatment of cells with
dehydroascorbic acid caused a small reduction in intracellular
levels of ROS. Although the reduction in intracellular ROS levels
was statistically significant (P V 0.02), the magnitude of the
reduction in ROS seemed to be minor compared with the reduction
in cytotoxicity. To further investigate the role of ROS in attenuating

cytotoxicity, we treated K562 and RL cells with N-acetylcysteine.
N-acetylcysteine and vitamin C both help to replenish important ROS-quenching thiols, such as glutathione, that play an
important role in neutralizing ROS and are both considered
important antioxidants (27). When cells were treated with
N-acetylcysteine before and during exposure to chemotherapeutic
agents, only cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin was reduced
(Fig. 5B). Although the ability of thiols to protect cells from
cisplatin has been described previously (28), these results show
that vitamin C has a more general cytoprotective profile, suggesting a different mechanism of action that could be unrelated to
the antioxidant effects of vitamin C.
Vitamin C treatment helps to preserve mitochondrial
membrane potential. Vitamin C is taken up by the mitochondria
and is able to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential after
exposure to apoptotic stimuli, such as fas ligand and g irradiation
(18, 29, 30). We assessed mitochondrial membrane potential in RL
and K562 cells treated with antineoplastic agents and found that all
agents tested led to a rapid reduction in mitochondrial membrane
potential (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with dehydroascorbic acid prevented early chemotherapy-induced mitochondrial membrane
depolarization with all agents tested. Mitochondrial membrane
potentials in either RL or K562 cells 6 hours after treatment with
chemotherapeutic drugs were similar to untreated control cells
after treatment with vitamin C. These results were consistent with
the notion that vitamin C exerts its inhibitory effects against
antineoplastic drugs by protecting cells from mitochondrial
membrane depolarization. To evaluate this possibility, we studied
the effects of vitamin C on actinonin, an antibiotic that targets
peptide deformylase (31), an enzyme that processes proteins
encoded by mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotic cells. Actinonin has
broad antineoplastic activity in vitro, and previous investigation
suggested that mitochondrial membrane depolarization plays a
central role in mediating differential activity in normal and
transformed cells (31). As with other cell lines, actinonin exposure
led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization in K562 and RL
cells that was inhibited by pretreatment with vitamin C (Fig. 6).
Although the approximate 15% maximal reduction of Dw m
observed with antineoplastic treatment at 6 hours may seem to
be a mild effect, we have recently shown in a lymphoma model that
targeting Bcl-2 family members with the BH3-mimetic AT-101
leads to a maximal 10% reduction in Dw m at 12 hours and that this

washed, and equilibrated for 1 h at 37jC. K562 and
RL cells either untreated ( ) or loaded (+) with 18 and
8.5 mmol/L vitamin C (Vit C ), respectively, were
exposed to antineoplastic agents for 6 h, and
mitochondrial membrane potential was measured as
the ratio of 530 to 585 nm fluorescence. Maximal
depolarization was determined by exposure to
100 nmol/L carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP ). The results are representative of at least
three separate experiments. The differences in
mitochondrial membrane potential between
chemotherapy-treated cells with and without
pretreatment with vitamin C were statistically
significant (P < 0.003 in RL cells, P < 0.0005 in
K562 cells; Student’s t test). Three separate
experiments were conducted in triplicate.

apparently mild depolarization induced further depolarization and
apoptosis at later time points both in vitro and in vivo (32).

Discussion
The finding that vitamin C antagonized the cytotoxic effects of
such a wide range of antineoplastic agents was unexpected. We had
originally hypothesized that vitamin C would antagonize the
cytotoxic effects of antineoplastic agents that use ROS to mediate
some activity. Our data indicate, however, that pretreatment with
dehydroascorbic acid attenuates the antineoplastic activity of
chemotherapeutic agents, including highly selective agents, that
do not lead to ROS generation. Whereas it is possible that small
effects on ROS may exert disproportionate effects on cytotoxicity, it
seems more likely that other mechanisms are involved. A recent
study suggested that both vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine may
diminish tumorigenesis through effects on hypoxia inducible factor1–related pathways rather than by preventing direct oxidative
damage to DNA (33). Whereas many antineoplastic agents target
DNA, our findings suggest that the spectrum of activity of vitamin C
is substantially broader than N-acetylcysteine, which antagonized
only cisplatin cytotoxicity. It has been shown that vitamin C
antagonizes fas ligand-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization (30). Previous studies have also shown that cisplatin,
doxorubicin, etoposide, and several other agents result in mitochondrial membrane depolarization (34, 35). We have expanded the
number of antineoplastic agents that lead to rapid mitochondrial
membrane depolarization and have found that this depolarization
can be inhibited by vitamin C. A substantial body of work has shown
that mitochondrial membrane depolarization plays an important
role in regulating cell death (36, 37). Thus, mitochondrial membrane
depolarization may be a common mechanism that contributes to
the cytotoxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents, including highly
selective agents, such as imatinib.
Whereas the effects of vitamin C on intracellular targets in the
nucleus or the cytoplasm, for example, cannot be excluded, we
hypothesize that the mitochondria are an important site of action
for vitamin C. Vitamin C enters the mitochondria, and recent work
shows that transport into the mitochondria occurs through the
glucose transporters (18, 38, 39). Although treatment with
antineoplastic agents does not generally lead to increased
intracellular ROS, it is possible that vitamin C in the mitochondria
plays a role in quenching local ROS. Alternatively, vitamin C in the
mitochondria may help to stabilize respiratory electron transport,
thereby preserving the most efficient means of energy generation
and maintaining overall cellular fitness. The role of vitamin C in
protecting mitochondria from cytotoxic agents is supported by the
finding that vitamin C antagonizes the cytotoxic effects of
actinonin. Actinonin specifically inhibits human mitochondrial
peptide deformylase, an enzyme whose central function seems to be
the deformylation of the 13 proteins encoded by mitochondria, all of
which play vital roles in electron transport and subsequent energy

generation (31). Although the precise mechanism and kinetics
through which vitamin C mediates its protective effects remain
unknown, the finding that vitamin C protects cells from actinonin
toxicity suggests that the ability of vitamin C to stabilize the mitochondria plays a central role in exerting its cytoprotective profile.
Taken together, our data show that pharmacologic concentrations of intracellular vitamin C antagonize the therapeutic
cytotoxic effects of antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents. This
finding could have important clinical relevance given the wide use
of vitamin C as a nutritional supplement. These results suggest
that supplementary vitamin C may have adverse consequences in
patients who are receiving cancer chemotherapy. Such a supposition, however, would need confirmation in other therapeutic
models or in human trials. Whereas we have used dehydroascorbic
acid in our experimental model to achieve high intracellular
concentrations of vitamin C, there is evidence from murine models
of human prostate cancer xenografts that ascorbic acid may be
converted to dehydroascorbic acid in the peritumor milieu, leading
to higher intracellular concentrations of vitamin C (40). Although
we studied cells derived from hematopoietic malignancies,
intracellular vitamin C accumulation has been observed in cell
lines derived from solid tumors, as well as solid tumor
xenografts(40), suggesting that our observations are unlikely to
be unique to hematologic cancers. This is supported by clinical
evidence showing that intratumor concentrations of vitamin C are
higher in cancer cells than in adjacent normal tissue in patients
who did not take supplementary vitamin C (41). It was notable that
the concentration of vitamin C measured in the tumors of the mice
in this study was similar to the concentration of vitamin C that can
be achieved in human leukocytes with oral vitamin C supplementation (42, 43), suggesting that our study conditions were relevant to clinical conditions. Therefore, it is possible that vitamin C
supplementation may alter the effectiveness of commonly used
chemotherapy agents and adversely influence treatment outcome.
