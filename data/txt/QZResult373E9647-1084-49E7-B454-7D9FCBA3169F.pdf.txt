ABSTRACT
Preclinical models suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have synergistic anticancer activity. We
designed a phase I study to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of combined
mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (1 mg-5 mg PO daily) and HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (100
mg-400 mg PO daily) in patients with advanced cancer. Seventy patients were
enrolled and 46 (66%) were evaluable for DLT assessment since they completed
cycle 1 without dose modification unless they had DLT. DLTs comprised grade
4 thrombocytopenia (n = 6) and grade 3 mucositis (n = 1). Sirolimus 4 mg and
vorinostat 300 mg was declared RP2D because MTD with sirolimus 5 mg caused
significant thrombocytopenia. The grade 3 and 4 drug-related toxic effects (including
DLTs) were thrombocytopenia (31%), neutropenia (8%), anemia (7%), fatigue (3%),
mucositis (1%), diarrhea (1%), and hyperglycemia (1%). Of the 70 patients, 35
(50%) required dose interruption or modification and 61 were evaluable for response.
Partial responses were observed in refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (-78%) and
perivascular epithelioid tumor (-54%), and stable disease in hepatocellular carcinoma
and fibromyxoid sarcoma. In conclusion, the combination of sirolimus and vorinostat
was feasible, with thrombocytopenia as the main DLT. Preliminary anticancer activity
was observed in patients with refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, perivascular epithelioid
tumor, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

and temsirolimus, an analogous ester of sirolimus,
dramatically suppressed survivin levels and produced
greater tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis than did
single-agent temsirolimus in vivo [22]. Another preclinical
study showed that, while HDAC inhibition alone led to
inhibition of LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase
and thus increased mTOR activity, the combination of
an HDAC inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor resulted in
synergistic tumor cell death in Hodgkin lymphoma cell
lines [23]. These preclinical data provided a mechanistic
rationale for further exploration of this approach in clinical
trials.
We hypothesized that combining vorinostat and
sirolimus would increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to
these drugs by simultaneously inhibiting mTOR, AKT, and
HDAC. Therefore, we designed this study to determine the
safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
phase II dose (RP2D), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
of the combination of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (1
mg-5 mg PO daily, q 28 days) and the HDAC inhibitor
vorinostat (100 mg-400 mg PO daily, q 28 days) in
patients with advanced cancer.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is
an important cell survival pathway [1]. Activation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with uncontrolled cell
proliferation and resistance to apoptosis [2]. Mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is phosphorylated in response
to PI3K/Akt activation. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
is constitutively activated in many different human
cancers, including ovarian, breast, and colon cancers and
glioblastoma [3-5]. Several mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
inhibitors are used in the clinic for the treatment of various
cancers [6-8].
Sirolimus is an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor that
has immunosuppressive [9] and antitumor properties [10,
11]. It inhibits S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, which
decreases the translation of mRNAs that are critical for
cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, and thus leads to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [12]. In addition, sirolimus
reduces the transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF1α) and subsequently leads to decreased production
of vascular endothelial growth factor, demonstrating
antiangiogenic effects in preclinical cancer models [13].
A paradoxical increase in p-AKT through disruption
of a p70S6K-dependent negative feedback loop has been
suggested as a mechanism of resistance to mTORC1
inhibition [14]. Developing targeting strategies that can
abrogate p-Akt upregulation in response to mTORC1
inhibition is thus a putatively desirable approach for
overcoming resistance to this family of drugs.
Post-translational modifications of chromatin
histones are key regulators of gene expression [15]. These
modifications include acetylation and deacetylation of
lysines in the tails of the core histones controlled by the
balanced action of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and
histone acetyltransferases [16]. HDACs also target nonhistone proteins, such as p53, tubulin, and transcription
factors, and regulate cell proliferation, cell migration,
and cell death. Aberrant expression of HDACs has been
associated with diverse leukemias, lymphomas, and solid
tumors [17]. Hydroxamate HDAC inhibitors, such as
vorinostat, function as pan-HDAC inhibitors, targeting
both class I and class II (including class IIb) HDACs.
HDAC inhibitors kill cells through diverse mechanisms,
including induction of oxidative injury, upregulation of
death receptors, disruption of the cell cycle checkpoint,
induction of heat shock protein 90 acetylation (leading
to increased degradation of p-Akt), upregulation of
proapoptotic proteins, and interference with proteasome
function [18-20].
Vorinostat also may lead to inhibition of PI3K
activity, possibly secondary to the modulation of
vorinostat-induced gene expression [21]. Vorinostat
diminishes the kinase activity of PIK3 in vitro, both in
mantle cell lymphoma Jeko1 cells and in PC3 prostate
cancer cells [21]. The combination of vorinostat

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
From March 2010 to December 2012, a total of 99
patients were screened. Of those, 82 met eligibility criteria,
and 70 were started on treatment at the dose escalation
phase (Figure 1). For the 12 patients who did not start
treatment, the reasons included lack of insurance coverage
(n = 4), clinical deterioration (n = 3), patient preference
(n = 1), or unknown reasons (n = 4). The 70 patients’
demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 1. There were 35 men and 35 women. Fifty-three
(76%) patients were white, and the median age at study
enrollment was 58 years (range, 16-79 years). Colorectal
cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma
comprised nearly half of the cases. The median number of
treatment cycles on the protocol was 2 (range, < 1-20), and
the median number of previous treatments was 4 (range,
0-9). Fifty-seven patients discontinued therapy because of
disease progression, 8 because of intolerance, and 5 for
other reasons, including noncompliance and withdrawal
of consent.

Toxicity
All 70 patients were evaluated for toxicity, and
46 patients (66%) were evaluable for DLTs (patients
who either had a DLT or completed cycle 1 without
dose interruption). Dose level 5A, 5 mg of sirolimus
and 300 mg of vorinostat, was declared the MTD of this

toxicity prior to first restaging and were excluded from the response evaluation. Those who discontinued therapy because of clinical disease
progression, prior to restaging scans, were included (depicted arbitrarily as +20% and shown with +).

combination on the basis of the DLTs; however, because
of significant non-dose-limiting hematological toxicity,
mainly prolonged or recurrent thrombocytopenia, 4 mg of
sirolimus and 300 mg of vorinostat were established as
RP2D for further investigation. Six patients experienced
a DLT during the first cycle, including 5 with grade 4
thrombocytopenia and 1 with grade 3 mucositis (Table 2).
One patient with grade 4 thrombocytopenia was treated at
dose level 0; however, this patient had a baseline platelet
count of 63,000/µL. The other DLTs were observed at
either dose level 5A (n = 1) or dose level 6 (n = 4).

Thrombocytopenia was the most common toxicity
(Table 3): 20 patients experienced grade 3 (n = 12) or
grade 4 (n = 8) thrombocytopenia during the study period,
including those who experienced thrombocytopenia as a
DLT during the first cycle. Thirteen patients experienced
recurrent grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia beyond
the first cycle; 2 of these patients experienced prolonged
grade 3 thrombocytopenia that required further dose
modification and interruption. Other grade 3 and grade 4
toxicities included neutropenia (grade 3, n = 5; grade 4, n
= 1), anemia (grade 3, n = 3; grade 4, n = 2), fatigue (grade

response (PR, n = 2) or durable stable disease for more
than 12 months (SD>12months, n = 2), as shown in
Figure 2. The objective response rate was 3%, 2 patients
experiencing a PR during the escalation phase. One patient
with relapsed, refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, who had
had 8 lines of previous therapy, including an autologous
stem cell transplant, experienced a 78% reduction in
target tumor lesions per Cheson criteria after 6 cycles of
therapy and remained on the protocol for 20 cycles (18.7
months), at which point he developed progressive disease.
This patient was treated at dose level 5A. Another patient
with perivascular epithelioid tumor, who was treated
at dose level 6, had a gradual reduction by as much as
54% in sum of target lesions after 6 cycles of therapy
and stayed on treatment for 8 cycles. One patient with
hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 patient with fibromyxoid
sarcoma had SD>12months. Representative imaging
studies for these patients are shown in Figure 3. At the
time of analysis, 57 (81%) patients had discontinued
therapy because of disease progression. Other reasons
for study discontinuation included toxicity (n = 8 [11%]),
withdrawal of consent without reported study-related

3, n = 2), diarrhea (grade 3, n = 1), and hyperglycemia
(grade 3, n = 1). One patient had recurrent grade 4 anemia
beyond the first cycle, and another had recurrent grade 4
neutropenia during the study. Thirty-five (50%) patients
required dose interruptions and/or reduction. Of the 35,
6 patients had dose interruption due to DLT during the
first cycle, 14 patients had other toxicity-related dose
interruption during the DLT period, and 15 patients had
dose interruptions after the first cycle (DLT window) was
completed. Eight (11%) patients discontinued the study
drugs because of intolerance (hematological toxicity, n =
4; nausea/vomiting or indigestion, n = 2; infection, n = 1,
and renal insufficiency, n = 1).

Efficacy
Of the 70 treated patients, 14 experienced clinical
progression before the first restaging scans and 47
underwent at least 1 restaging imaging procedure during
treatment on the protocol, and thus 61 were considered
evaluable for response. Four patients had a partial

thrombocytopenia (5/6, 83%) and mucositis (1/6, 17%).
Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent grade 3 or grade
4 treatment-related toxicity (28.5%). This is not surprising
since both single-agent sirolimus and single-agent
vorinostat can cause thrombocytopenia. For instance,
sirolimus was associated with thrombocytopenia in up to
30% of patients who received higher doses (5 mg daily)
after transplantation and in 10% of patients with advanced
cancer [11, 24, 25]. Vorinostat was associated with grade 3
or grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 5%-20% of cases [26-29].
A similar combination of everolimus, an mTOR
inhibitor, and panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor,
was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with
lymphoma, including Hodgkin lymphoma [30]. Patients
enrolled in this study had similar toxicity profiles to those
in our study, with a high incidence of thrombocytopenia
(59%) and neutropenia (up to 50%) at the effective
dose level. The DLT was grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
Neutropenia was not as common in our study, which may
be explained by the different patient populations: unlike
some patients in the other study, many of the patients in
the current dose-escalation study had a solid tumor, with
no history of heavy bone marrow-suppressive therapy.
The incidence of pneumonia was also higher with the
panobinostat and everolimus combination; we did not
observe this in our study with sirolimus and vorinostat.
In the current study, the 2 patients with
Hodgkin lymphoma and 4 of the 6 patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma experienced grade 3 or grade
4 thrombocytopenia during treatment. On the basis
of our observations, we speculate that the patients
who had undergone prior myelotoxic chemotherapy
or had a decreased liver function reserve had more
severe thrombocytopenia. It is notable that the degree
of thrombocytopenia was often not cumulative, and
many patients who experienced grade 3 or grade 4
thrombocytopenia had a spontaneous recovery, which even
allowed dose reescalation of study drugs. Considering
that the population included in our study had undergone
multiple cancer treatments prior to study participation
and that the inclusion criteria allowed baseline platelet
counts of 50,000/µL, we believe that the severity of
thrombocytopenia observed in this study was reasonably
safe.

toxicities (n = 3 [4%]), and noncompliance (n = 2 [3%]).
The median duration of follow-up was 27.3 weeks (range,
2.9-188 weeks). The median PFS was 9 weeks (95% CI:
8-10.3 weeks). At the time of analysis, 63 (90%) patients
had died. The median OS was 24.3 weeks (95% CI: 19.131 weeks).

Pharmacokinetics
Sirolimus levels were determined for 5 patients.
Three of these patients were treated at dose level 5A
(MTD), 1 at dose level 3, and 1 at dose level 6. Sirolimus
levels during therapy ranged between 3.2 ng/mL and 33.5
ng/mL, with a mean of 20.5 ng/mL, which was above the
therapeutic range recommended for post-transplantation
immunosuppression in these patients. Among those who
had sirolimus levels drawn, 2 patients had SD>12 months
and 1 patient had a PR. All patients experienced grade 3
thrombocytopenia. Although the number of patients is
small, no significant relationship between sirolimus level
and degree of toxicity was observed on the basis of these
patients’ samples.

Molecular profiles
Among the 70 patients treated, 48 had molecular
testing of their tumor, and 41 of them were evaluable for
disease response assessment (Supplementary Table 1);
however, only 10 patients had comprehensive targeted
next-generation sequencing for molecular alterations of at
least 45 or more genes. Among the 4 patients who had PR
or SD>12 months, 1 patient with Hodgkin lymphoma had
TSC2 loss, a molecular aberration that putatively activates
the mTOR pathway. The molecular aberrations in patients
who experienced a PR or SD>12 months are shown in
Table 4. Complete list of detected molecular aberrations
and treatment outcomes is in Supplementary table 1.

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrated that the combination of 4
mg of sirolimus and 300 mg of vorinostat was feasible in
patients with advanced malignancy. The DLTs included
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

67527

One patient in our study experienced grade 3
mucositis, which was more likely related to sirolimus
than to vorinostat. Another 4 patients experienced grade
1 mucositis. This frequency was lower than expected
considering that 60% of patients in the panobinostat and
everolimus study had grade 1 to grade 2 mucositis during
treatment [30]. We observed very few metabolic adverse
events, such as hypertriglyceridemia or hyperglycemia,
which are often associated with mTOR inhibitors. One
patient did experience grade 3 hyperglycemia; this
patient had had type II diabetes for more than 5 years
prior to starting treatment on this protocol, along with
other metabolic risk factors, including morbid obesity,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
We did not observe any strong correlation between
molecular aberrations related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway activation and response to therapy, although the
generalizability of this observation may be limited because
of the small number of patients. Two patients were found
to have activating PIK3CA mutations. One patient had
bladder cancer with PIK3CA H1047L and was treated at
dose level 4; however, he discontinued therapy because
of worsening renal function (> grade 3) and was not
evaluable for response. Another patient had hepatocellular
carcinoma with PIK3CA H1047R and was treated at
dose level 6. He had SD, with a 15% decrease in tumor
measurements after the second cycle, but the disease had
progressed rapidly at the next restaging. Only 1 of the 4
patients who had a PR or SD>12 months had a molecular
aberration related to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, a
TSC2 loss. Inactivation of TSC2 leads to activation of
mTOR; thus, it can be a target for mTOR inhibitor therapy.
Preclinical and anecdotal evidence suggests that the loss
of TSC2 signal may predict a better response to mTOR
inhibitor therapy [31, 32]. One patient with a PR and one
patient with a SD> 12 months had KIT M541L mutation;
however, previous data suggested that this might be a
common germline polymorphism rather than a driver
mutation [33].
The most remarkable response was seen in a
patient with heavily pretreated Hodgkin lymphoma,
which is consistent with the results of in vitro preclinical
experiments [23]. There is in vitro evidence of the
immunomodulatory effects of HDAC inhibitors, including
suppression of T cell PD-1 expression [34], upregulation
of PD-1 ligands [35], and inhibition of regulatory T
cells, which have the potential to enhance the antitumor
immune response [36]. In addition, inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to selectively
reduce the activity of regulatory T cells [37]. Even
though mTOR inhibitors in general are deemed to have
immunosuppressive properties, we believe that in the
context of this study the combination of HDAC and mTOR
inhibition can in fact activate an anticancer immune
response through its effects on the microenvironment as
well as its direct inhibitory effect on cancer cells. Clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor
has been remarkable in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma
[38]. It is plausible that patients with tumor types that
exhibit a higher degree of immune dysregulation and
an inflammatory microenvironment, such as Hodgkin
lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, experienced a
more significant benefit from this combination because of
the potential immunomodulatory role of this combination.
Finally, about half of the patients required dose
interruptions or dose reduction, which could plausibly
alter the efficacy. However, our sample size was limited to
demonstrate any dose-response relationship.
This study has several limitations. First, 24 (34%) of
the 70 patients were not available for DLT assessment, as
protocol-defined DLT assessment required completion of
the first cycle without dose reduction for any reason other
than DLT. Some of these patients experienced clinical
progression prior to completing the first cycle, and some
had toxic effects that were significant enough to interrupt
the doses but did not last long enough to meet the criteria
for DLT. This may have resulted in underestimation of
the toxic effects and thus identification of the RP2D at the
lower dose level than the MTD. Second, both sirolimus
and vorinostat are relatively infrequently used in the clinic
because of the emergence of newer agents. Although our
study findings suggest that combining mTOR and HDAC
inhibitors can be meaningful, it might be challenging to
find adequate support for further development because
of the short residual patent life (if any) of both drugs in
this combination. Nevertheless, the cost of this therapy is
anticipated to decrease, which might be viewed favorably
by cooperative groups or other non-commercial sources
of funding. Furthermore, the protocol included correlative
studies, but they were optional; at the time of analysis
we did not have enough data to identify biomarkers
of response. Finally, while most patients tolerated the
treatment relatively well, some experienced dose-limiting
or even dose-prohibitive thrombocytopenia.
In summary, combining mTORC1 inhibition with
HDAC inhibition appears to be a safe and efficacious
strategy for several cancer types. On the basis of the
activity signals observed in this study, we are currently
enrolling patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or perivascular
epithelioid tumor into expansion cohorts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a non-randomized, open-label,
dose-escalation phase I clinical trial of sirolimus and
vorinostat (NCT01087554) performed at The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).
The primary objective was to determine the safety, MTD
and RP2D, and DLTs of the combination of sirolimus and
vorinostat in patients with advanced cancer. The protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Board. All

participants gave informed consent prior to entering the
study.
We enrolled patients with histologically confirmed
metastatic or locally advanced cancer who were treated at
the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy at MD Anderson
between March 2010 and December 2012. Among those
who presented to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy,
patients who met all the eligibility criteria were selected.
All patients had disease that had failed to respond to
standard therapy, had progressed despite standard therapy,
or for which there was no available therapy that would
prolong survival by at least 3 months. Patients were
required to be off systemic therapy for at least 3 weeks
before starting the protocol (or 5 half-lives in the case
of biologics or targeted agents). Other inclusion criteria
included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3; adequate organ
and bone marrow function, as defined by an absolute
neutrophil count of 1,000/µL or greater, a platelet count of
50,000/µL or greater, a total bilirubin level less than twice
the institutional upper limits of normal (in the absence of
Gilbert syndrome), an alanine aminotransferase level less
than 2.5 times (less than 5 times for patients with liver
involvement) the institutional upper limits of normal,
and a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL or less; and the use
of contraception during the study period. Patients were
excluded if they had a history of myocardial infarction
within 3 months prior to starting treatment, were pregnant
or breastfeeding, or had undergone a major surgical
procedure within 28 days before starting therapy. Palliative
radiation therapy was allowed during the study treatment.
The use of other standard or investigational anticancer
agents was not allowed.
Patients were enrolled at 8 dose levels. The starting
doses were 1 mg of oral sirolimus daily and 100 mg of
oral vorinostat daily for 28 days, and doses were increased
according to a standard “3+3” dose escalation design
(Table 2). The study allowed to enroll up to 3 additional
patients to each dose level to further evaluate safety. The
concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors was discouraged.
Dose modification was allowed for treatment-related toxic
effects. Patients continued treatment until they experienced
disease progression or intolerable toxic effects or until
the treating physician or patient felt that it was not in the
patient’s best interest to continue for any reason.
Patients who had DLT or completed cycle 1 without
dose modification were evaluable for the DLT analysis.
Patients not evaluable for DLT were replaced. The MTD
was defined as the highest dose at which no more than
33% of patients developed a DLT. DLTs were treatmentrelated grade 3 or grade 4 non-hematologic toxic effects,
as defined by the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0, or as grade
4 hematologic toxic effects lasting more than 7 days or
accompanied by fever (for neutropenia) or bleeding (for
thrombocytopenia) during cycle 1. Grade 3 toxicities such

as hyperglycemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and
asymptomatic lipase elevation were excluded from the
DLTs if manageable with appropriate medication. Serum
sirolimus levels were measured when available to assess
pharmacokinetics. Vorinostat levels were not assessed.
Tumor genomic analyses were performed whenever
feasible using PCR or next-generation sequencing-based
methods such FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme
(Foundation Medicine, Boston, MA), IonTorrent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), MassARRAY (Sequenom,
San Diego, CA) and PCR-based DNA sequencing method
that used primers designed by MD Anderson’s Molecular
Diagnostic Laboratory.
Response to therapy was assessed according
to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1 [39] or Revised Response Criteria for
Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson criteria) [40]. The median
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
