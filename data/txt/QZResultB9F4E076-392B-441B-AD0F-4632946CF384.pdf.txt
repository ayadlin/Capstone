ABSTRACT
Renal fibrosis contributes to declining renal function in the elderly. What is
unclear however, is whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes
to this age-related renal fibrosis. Here, we analyzed indicators of EMT during kidney
aging and investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of short-term regimens
of caloric restriction (CR) or caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs), including resveratrol
and metformin. High glucose was used to induce premature senescence and EMT
in human primary proximal tubular cells (PTCs) in vitro. To test the role of AMPKmTOR signaling, siRNA was used to deplete AMPK. Cellular senescence and AMPKmTOR signaling markers associated with EMT were detected. CR or CRMs treatment
alleviated age-related EMT in aging kidneys, which was accompanied by activation
of AMPK-mTOR signaling. High glucose induced premature senescence and EMT in
PTCs in vitro, which was accompanied by down-regulation of AMPK/mTOR signaling.
CRMs alleviated high glucose-induced senescence and EMT via stimulation of AMPK/
mTOR signaling. Activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling protected PTCs from high
glucose-induced EMT and cellular senescence. Short-term regimens of CR and CRMs
alleviated age-related EMT via AMPK-mTOR signaling, suggesting a potential approach
to reducing renal fibrosis during aging.

INTRODUCTION

Morphological and functional changes that
accompany kidney aging are thought to contribute
the development of CKD in the elderly. For example,
processes that characterize kidney aging include
glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy,
vascular sclerosis, and loss of renal function [3]. The
mechanistic basis of kidney aging is cellular senescence,
which is characterized by the inability of cells to
proliferate despite the presence of ample space, nutrients
and growth factors in the medium [4, 5]. Although renal
fibrosis has been observed in elderly individuals in the
absence of overt CKD [6], the relationship between
cellular senescence and fibrosis during kidney aging is yet
to be determined.
EMT is the process whereby differentiated epithelial
cells undergo a phenotypic conversion that gives rise to

According to the data from the United States Renal
Data System, the number of patients on maintenance
dialysis will double over the next few years, and a
relatively large number of the patients newly diagnosed
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) each year are elderly
[1]. CKD, which is defined by reduced glomerular
filtration rate, proteinuria, or structural kidney disease,
is a growing problem among the aging population, to
the extent that the elderly have an average prevalence
of CKD that is three to five times higher than that
observed in young and middle-aged populations [2].
Accordingly, CKD predisposes the elderly to a high risk
of cardiovascular events and premature death.

matrix-producing fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. EMT is
increasingly recognized as a key process that contributes
to kidney fibrosis and the decline of renal function [7].
Age-related changes in the levels of transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) result in a complex shift of the
microenvironmental milieu that is thought to affect tissue
homeostasis under both normal and abnormal conditions,
triggering EMT and progressive ﬁbrosis [8]. 	Given that
senescence and EMT play well-documented roles in the
etiology and progression of age-associated CKD, the
development of therapeutic interventions to retard or
reverse these processes is warranted.
Caloric restriction has a variety of beneficial effects
on health, including the prolongation of lifespan. We have
previously demonstrated that short-term (8 week) CR
reduced the rate of renal senescence in rat by increasing
autophagy and subsequently reducing oxidative damage
[9]. Consistent with this, the CRM metformin has been
shown to oppose aging in SHR mice via a mechanism
involving transcriptional repression of genes encoding key
drivers of the EMT program [10]. Similarly, metformin
has been shown to impede TGF-β-promoted loss of the
epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
(11), and to prevent accumulation of the mesenchymal
marker vimentin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells
[11, 12]. Similar results have been reported for another
CRM, the stilbene derivative resveratrol, which has been
shown to inhibit senescence in endothelial progenitor cells
[13] and WI-38 fibroblasts [14], and to reduce epidermal
growth factor-induced EMT in MCF-7 cells [15].
These observations notwithstanding, the effects
of short-term regimens of CR and CRM on cellular
senescence and EMT in the aging kidney remain
unknown. Here, we asked whether short-term CR and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CRM treatment could alleviate renal cell senescence and
EMT in the aging kidney, and evaluated the mechanistic
basis for these effects. Our study provides a rationale for
the development of EMT- and cellular senescence-based
therapeutics for the protection of the kidney, and for the
treatment of CKD in the elderly population.

RESLUTS
Age-related metabolic parameters and renal
functions in the YAL, OAL, OCR and OMET
groups of SD rats
Body weight, 24 h urine protein (PRO/24 h),
triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CH) were increased
in the OAL group compared to the YAL group. After CR
or treatment with metformin for 8 weeks, body weight,
PRO/24 h and TG were decreased in both the OCR and
OMET groups compared to the OAL group (Table 1).

CR and metformin treatment alleviated agerelated EMT in aging kidneys
Renal expression of α-smooth muscle actin
(α-SMA), a speciﬁc marker of mesenchymal ﬁbroblasts,
and the transcription factor Zeb1, an inducer of EMT [16]
were higher in the OAL group than in the YAL group. In
contrast, expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin
were lower in the OAL group than in the YAL group
(Figure 1). After short-term CR or metformin treatment,
renal expression of both Zeb1 and α-SMA was lower in the
OCR and OMET groups than in the OAL group, whereas
renal expression of E-cadherin showed the opposite trend
(Figure 1). These results indicate that EMT was more

metformin treatment alleviated cellular senescence in rat
kidney.

CR and metformin treatment alleviated agerelated renal cell senescence in aging kidneys

CR and metformin treatment activated AMPKmTOR signaling

A characteristic feature of cell senescence is cell
cycle arrest, which is indicated by changes in cellular
levels of the telomeres, P16 and P21 [17]. As such, we next
compared the renal expression levels of P16 and P21 in the
YAL, OAL, OCR and OMET groups of rats. Expression of
P16 and P21 was increased in the OAL group, compared
with the YAL group. However, expression of P16 and P21
was lower in the OCR and OMET groups than in the OAL
group (Figure 2A&2B). Similar results were obtained with
respect to SA-β-gal (Figure 2C), the activity of which
has been previously shown to be elevated in senescent

Western blot analysis indicated that AMPK/mTOR
signaling was lower in the OAL group than in the YAL
group, and that CR and metformin treatment activated this
pathway in the OCR and OMET groups (Figure 3).

treated PTCs. Induction of P16, P21, Zeb1 and α-SMA,
repression of E-cadherin and AMPK/mTOR signaling,
and increased SAHF were observed in PTCs when treated
with high glucose, but not with the osmolarity control OS
(Figure 4B-4E). Comparable results with respect to α-SMA
and E-cadherin were obtained with immunofluorescence
staining, which also demonstrated epithelial cell to
mesenchymal morphologic transformation of PTCs
(Figure 4A).

We next used AMPK siRNA to conﬁrm the role
of AMPK/mTOR signaling in cellular senescence and
EMT (Figure 6). Compared with control cells, reduced
AMPK/mTOR signaling and E-cadherin expression, and
increased expression of Zeb1, α-SMA, P16 and P21 were
observed in AMPK-silenced PTCs, but not in metforminor resveratrol- treated AMPK-silenced PTCs . These
results indicate that metformin and resveratrol alleviate
EMT and senescence via AMPK/mTOR signaling, and
that activation of AMPK/mTOR protected PTCs from high
glucose-induced EMT and cellular senescence.

Metformin and resveratrol alleviated high
glucose-induced senescence and EMT via
stimulation of AMPK/mTOR signaling.
Induction of E-cadherin expression and AMPK/
mTOR signaling, and repression of P16, P21, Zeb1 and
α-SMA expression, were observed in the high glucose
plus CRM (metformin or resveratrol) co-stimulated cells
compared to cells stimulated with HG alone (Figure 5).
These results supported the hypothesis that metformin and
resveratrol can alleviate high glucose-induced senescence
and EMT via stimulation of AMPK/mTOR signaling.
Thus, the AMPK/mTOR pathway appears to play a key
role in the regulation of senescence and EMT of the aging
kidney.

DISCUSSION
Decades of research have associated age-related
loss of kidney function with increased renal vascular
resistance, reduced renal plasma flow, increased filtration
fraction, lower GFR, and progressive structural and
functional deterioration of the kidney. Moreover, both PTC
senescence and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are known to
contribute to age-associated loss of kidney function. Aging
kidneys are also characterized by common hallmarks of
cellular senescence, including increased expression of P16

and P21, and increased SA-β-gal activity. Accumulation
of the extracellular matrix in the tubulointerstitial space is
mediated primarily by myofibroblasts, and EMT serves as
a source of interstitial, matrix-producing myofibroblasts
[19]. Efforts to understand age-related changes in kidney
function, and to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie
these changes, may help to focus future research efforts to
identify potential therapeutic interventions.
Here, we first examined compared age-related
metabolic parameters and renal function between the
groups of rats. Compared to the young rats, increases
in age-related proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia and
hypertriglyceridemia were observed in the older rats
(Table 1).
We proceeded to demonstrate increased cellular
senescence, as indicated by overexpression of P16, P21
and SA-β-gal in the kidneys of the aging rats. Cellular
senescence is not only a marker of renal aging but
also actively participates in the process. Furthermore,
senescent cells secrete inflammatory factors and growth
factors, resulting in a complex shift within the cellular
microenvironment, which induces EMT. Increased
levels of EMT as a function of age were demonstrated
in this study. We found that EMT was increased in the
older rats, compared with the younger rats, indicating
that EMT increases as a function of age. Given that
cellular senescence and EMT contribute to the decline
in renal function with age, we investigated the effect of
interventions on both senescence and age-related EMT in
our rat models. While previous studies have shown that
CR decreased the abundance of senescent cells, improved
telomere maintenance and reduced the levels of oxidative
damage markers in the small intestine and liver [20], and
alleviated age-related increase in EMT in the thymus [21],
similar studies in the aging kidney have been lacking.
Consistent with previous reports [22-25], shortterm CR was found to decrease proteinuria and
hypertriglyceridemia, but to have no similar observable
effect on hypercholesterolemia. This is, to our knowledge,
the first demonstration of the effect of metformin on
nondiabetic proteinuria.
Here we report that short-term CR alleviates cellular
senescence and EMT in the aging kidney. However,
it should be pointed out that even were our study to
substantiate short-term CR as an effective intervention
for cell senescence and EMT, the degree of restriction
required would limit the utility of this intervention. As
an alternative strategy, new research has focused on the
development of CRM. The objective of CRM research
is to identify compounds that mimic the effects of CR
by targeting metabolic and stress response pathways
affected by CR without actually restricting caloric intake
[26]. Previous studies of CRM indicated that metformin
reduced the degree of SAHF, the average nuclear area, and
the nuclear accumulation of γH2AX in skin fibroblasts. In
addition, metformin treatment quantitatively reduced the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

number of fibroblasts with large nuclear areas, as well as
the number of fibroblasts positive for SA-β-gal activity
and intense nuclear γH2AX staining [10]. Metformin has
also been shown to impede the generation of the cancer
stem cell phenotype via transcriptional repression of
key drivers of the EMT genetic program, such as ZEB1.
Moreover, metformin impeded the TGF-β-promoted
loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells and prevented TGF-induced cell scattering
and accumulation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin
in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [11, 12]. The present
study substantiates the beneficial effect of metformin
treatment on cellular senescence and EMT in the aging
kidney.
With respect to how short-term CR and metformin
treatment might directly impact cellular senescence and
EMT, one interesting candidate is the AMPK-mTOR
signaling pathway. AMPK is a heterotrimeric serine/
threonine protein kinase complex that has been shown
to be directly activated by CR and metformin [27, 28],
and mTOR has been recognized as a downstream target
of AMPK. A series of phosphorylation steps leads to
subsequent repression of mTOR activity through cellular
energy stress-induced AMPK activation [29, 30]. AMPK
has been shown to directly phosphorylate the mTOR
binding partner Raptor, and Raptor phosphorylation is
known to be required to inhibit mTOR activity under
energy-deprived conditions [31]. Moreover, mTOR
activation induces senescence in human fibroblasts
[32], and Wnt1-driven activation of the mTOR pathway
causes senescence and loss of epithelial stem cells after
a short hyperproliferative period [33]. Consistent with
these observations, we propose that short-term CR and
metformin treatment can alleviate cellular senescence and
EMT via activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling.
In the in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that
AMPK/mTOR signaling in kidney was downregulated
with age, and that this was reversed by short-term CR
and metformin treatment. In order to further verify this
pathway, we induced EMT and cellular senescence of
PTCs in vitro with high glucose [34, 35]. We found that
exposure of PTCs to high glucose for 48 h resulted in
the high glucose-induced EMT and cellular senescence,
decreased expression of activated AMPK and decreased
AMPK/mTOR signaling. Costimulation of PTCs with
high glucose and resveratrol or metformin, both of which
activate AMPK [28, 36], alleviated high glucose-induced
EMT and cellular senescence, and increased AMPK/
mTOR signaling. Moreover, mTOR was upregulated,
and EMT and senescence were increased in AMPKsilenced cells, but were not alleviated in AMPK-silenced
cells that had been treated with metformin or resveratrol.
These results indicated that metformin and resveratrol
inhibited EMT and senescence of PTC via AMPK/mTOR
signaling. It is possible that the data presented here could
be extrapolated to explain the mechanisms of fibrosis seen
16117

in other organs during aging, and to provide strategies to
overcome this process.
In conclusion, our study furnishes a mechanistic link
between the AMPK-dependent abrogation of senescence
by short-term CR or CRM and the development of the agerelated profibrotic phenotype. Remarkably, short-term CR
or CRM showed simultaneous protective effects on renal
senescence and aging-related EMT, further emphasizing
the importance of anti-aging treatments in the protection
of kidney function in the elderly.

of human PTCs were performed as described previously
[37, 38]. Brieﬂy, renal cortical tissue was dissected from
the medulla, minced, digested with collagenase (class
II, 300 U/mg; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO,
USA) and passed through 100 μm and 200 μm meshes.
The filtered cells were resuspended in 45% Percoll
(Pharmacia, Peapack, NJ, USA) and separated into four
distinct bands by isopycnic centrifugation. The lowest
band was removed for culture. PTCs were resuspended
in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12
media (containing 5.5 mM D-glucose; Hyclone, Logan,
UT, USA), supplemented with 15% FBS, penicillin (50
U/mL, Sigma Chemical Co), streptomycin (50 μg/mL;
Sigma Chemical Co.), human transferrin (5 μg/mL;
Sigma Chemical Co.), bovine insulin (5 μg/mL; Sigma
Chemical Co.) and EGF (10 ng/mL; Sigma Chemical
Co.). The tubular fragments were plated at a density of 1.5
mg pellet/cm2 in 25 cm2 ﬂasks. The cells were incubated
in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37°C
(Sanyo Corporation), and the medium was changed every
48 hours. Cells in passages 3 to 5 were selected for this
study. In order to explore the effect of high glucose on
PTCs, serum-deprived cells were incubated separately in
normal glucose control [cultured in 5.5 mM D-glucose
(NG)], osmotic control [cultured in 5.5 mM D-glucose
plus 24.5 mM mannitol (OS)] and highglucose group
[cultured in 30 mM D-glucose (HG)]. In order to explore
the effects of metformin and resveratrol on cellular
senescence and EMT in PTCs, cells were treated with 2
mmol/L metformin or 50 μmol/L resveratrol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained under
specific pathogen-free conditions with 22±1°C, 40%
humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, one rat per cage, and
free access to water. The experiments involving animals
included 3-month-old male SD rats (YAL, n = 6) and
25-month-old male SD rats (n = 24), and all of these
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the Chinese PLA General
Hospital. The 25-month-old male SD rats were divided
into 3 groups: OAL, OCR and OMET (n = 8 per group).
During the following 8 weeks, the OAL group was fed ad
libitum, whereas the OCR group was fed an amount of
food corresponding to 60% of that ingested by the OAL
group over the same time period. Food consumption was
measured every 2 weeks. Rats in the OMET group were
treated with metformin at 300 mg/kg/d solubilized in
water and had free access to food. At the end of the 8 week
period, all rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal
injection of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). Kidney
tissues were removed and perfused with ice-cold, isotonic
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) to remove any
remaining blood. A portion of the kidney tissue was
immersed in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek,
Torrance, CA, USA) for immunofluorescence staining.
The remaining tissue was immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing.

Transfection with plasmid
Cells were cultured to 50-60% conﬂuence prior
to transfection. Dilute siRNA-AMPK or siRNA-con in
200 μl of jetPRIME™ buffer (jetPRIMETM, Polyplustransfection, Strasbourg, France) was vortexed and spun
down prior to the addition of 8 μl of jetPRIME™ reagent
(jetPRIMETM, Polyplus-transfection). The mixture was
then vortexed, spun down, and incubated for 10 min at
room temperature. Finally, the entire transfection mix
was added to 5 mL of medium. The final concentration of
the siRNA-AMPK and siRNA-con was 30 nM per well.
The medium was changed after 24 h, and the cells were
then incubated with 2 mmol/L metformin or 50 μmol/L
resveratrol for 24 h.

Cell preparation and culture conditions
Segments of macroscopically and histologically
normal renal cortex were obtained aseptically from adult
human kidneys that had been surgically removed due to
the appearance of small (<6 cm) renal adenocarcinomas,
pelviureteric transitional cell carcinomas or benign
angiomyolipomas. Informed consent was obtained prior to
each operative procedure, and the use of the human renal
tissue for primary culture was reviewed and approved by
the Human Medical Research Ethics Committee at the
Chinese PLA General Hospital. Isolation and incubation

Abcam) at 1:500, anti-P16 (Mouse; Abcam) at 1:1000,
anti-P21 (Rabbit; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA)
at 1:5000, anti-mTOR (Rabbit; Abcam) at 1:500, or
anti-phospho-mTOR (Rabbit; Abcam) at 1:500. After
being washed with Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween (TBST) 20, the membranes were probed
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). After washing again
with TBST, the bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (DP2-BSW; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) and densitometry was performed using ImageJ
(Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA).

Cryostat sections (4 μm) were fixed in 0.2%
glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 15 min, and then washed in PBS and incubated in
freshly prepared SA-β-gal staining solution (1 mg/mL
X-gal, 40 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 5
mM potassium ferrocyanide, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM
MgCl2) at 37°C without CO2 overnight. The tissue
sections were counterstained with eosin and examined
under a microscope.

Senescence-associated
(SAFH) analysis

focal

heterochromatin

PTCs were cultured directly on glass cover slips and
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. The DNA was
visualized following staining with DAPI (1 mg/mL) for 3
min. The cover slips were mounted in a 90% glycerol/PBS
solution and examined using a laser confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis

Immunofluorescent staining

All experiments were repeated at least three times.
The results are expressed as the means ± SD. Statistical
analyses were performed using analysis of variance with
SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA), and a level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

PTCs were seeded into wells and cultured for 24 h
until the cells reached conﬂuence. After stimulation, the
cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at
4°C; permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100; blocked with
5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature;
and incubated simultaneously with anti-E-cadherin
(1:100) and anti-α-SMA (1:50) at 4°C overnight. Then,
the cells were probed with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology) and CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (1:400; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for
1.5 h in dark. Finally, the cells were incubated with
Mounting Medium with DAPI (Zhongshan Golden
bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) in the dark for 5
min. The immunoassayed proteins were observed using
a ﬂuorescence microscope (FV10-ASW; Olympus), and
the cells were photographed using a confocal microscope
(Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). Renal tissues were embedded
in OCT compound. Cryostat sections (4 μm) were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with casein, and then
stained directly with anti-E-cadherin and anti-α-SMA. The
subsequent procedures were the same as described above.
