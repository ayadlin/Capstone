Abstract
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is highly expressed in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia with the mixed-lineage leukemia
(MLL) gene rearrangement refractory to chemotherapy. We
examined the biological effect of FLT3-ligand (FL) on 18 Bprecursor leukemic cell lines with variable karyotypic abnormalities, and found that nine of nine MLL-rearranged cell
lines with wild-type FLT3, in contrast to other leukemic cell
lines, are significantly inhibited in their proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner by FL. This inhibition was due to
induction of the G0-G1 arrest. A marked up-regulation of p27
by suppression of its protein degradation and an abrogation
of constitutive signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 phosphorylation were revealed in arrested leukemia
cells after FL stimulation. Importantly, FL treatment rendered
not only cell lines but also primary leukemia cells with MLL
rearrangement resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. MLLrearranged leukemia cells adhering to the bone marrow
stromal cell line, which expresses FL as the membrane-bound
form, were induced to quiescent state resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, but their chemosensitivity was significantly
restored in the presence of neutralizing anti-FL antibody.
The FL/FLT3 interaction between leukemia cells and bone
marrow stromal cells expressing FL at high levels should
contribute, at least in part, to persistent minimal-residual
disease of MLL-rearranged leukemia in bone marrow. [Cancer
Res 2007;67(20):9852–61]

Introduction
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) belongs to the receptor
tyrosine kinase class III family and plays an important role in an
early stage of hematopoiesis (1–3). In normal bone marrow, FLT3 is
expressed predominantly in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
(2, 4) and FLT3-ligand (FL) shows a strong synergy with other
cytokines in their proliferation (5, 6). FLT3 is also expressed at
considerable levels in most clinical samples from acute myeloge-

nous leukemia (AML) and B-precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) patients (7, 8). However, the growth-promoting
activity of FL alone in AML and ALL cells is heterogeneous and
rather modest in comparison with other effective cytokines (6, 8, 9).
Recently, two types of FLT3 mutations were found in leukemic
cells, which activate constitutively the FLT3 tyrosine kinase. One is
internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain
of FLT3 (10), and the other is a point mutation of D835/I836 within
the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3
(FLT3-TK mutation; refs. 11, 12). Although less frequently, active
point mutations other than D835/I836 have been known in the
juxtamembrane domain of FLT3. Several studies have shown that
FLT3-ITDs confer a poor prognosis in adult AML (13, 14) and in
childhood AML (15, 16).
The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement results
from chromosomal translocation at 11q23, and frequently observed
in infantile ALL and therapy-related secondary leukemia with a
very poor prognosis (17, 18). Armstrong et al. (19) reported that
MLL-rearranged leukemia has a highly distinct gene expression
profile that is consistent with the developmental stage of a very
early hematopoietic progenitor, and that the FLT3 gene is the most
differentially expressed gene that distinguishes MLL-rearranged
leukemia from other subtypes of ALL and AML. We recently
showed that a FLT3-TK mutation is also detected in 16% of MLLrearranged ALL in infants (20). Under the hypothesis that
constitutive activation of FLT3 might be involved in maintenance
and development of MLL-rearranged leukemia as a second hit, new
therapeutic approaches using FLT3-targeted tyrosine kinase
inhibitors are emerging for the treatment of MLL-rearranged
leukemia overexpressing FLT3 with or without activating mutations (21, 22).
In the present study, we showed that FL stimulation specifically
induced MLL-rearranged leukemia cells into quiescence resistant
to antileukemic agents, and postulated that the FL/FLT3
interaction possibly implicated in the formation of minimal
residual disease (MRD) of this leukemia.

Table 1. KOCL-33 with t(11;19) is a special cell line with a D835 point
mutation of FLT3 (20), whereas other cell lines with or without MLL gene
rearrangement had neither FLT3-TK mutation nor ITDs. Human bone
marrow stromal cell line KM-104 was used as the feeder expressing FL as
the membrane-bound form (25). Fourteen primary leukemia samples with
(n = 9) and without (n = 5) MLL rearrangement were also used after
obtaining written informed consents.
Antibodies and reagents. FL was purchased from Peprotech. Biotinylated FL and neutralizing anti-FL monoclonal antibody (mAb) were
purchased from R&D Systems. Cycloheximide, bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd), and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. Daunorubicin
and 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) were obtained from Meiji Seika
and Nippon Shinyaku, respectively. PKC412 (N-benzoylstaurosporine, a
FLT3 kinase inhibitor) was kindly provided by Novartis. Polyclonal
antibodies against phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of
transcription 5 (STAT5; Tyr694), p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), phosphorylated p44/42MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology;
polyclonal antibodies against cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), cyclin E,
and p27 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; CDK2 was from
PharMingen; and cyclin A was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. mAbs
against cyclin B, cyclin D3, and STAT5 were purchased from Transduction
Laboratories; phosphotyrosine, CDK6, p21, c-Myc, and a-tubulin were from
UBI, Lab Vision Corporation, PharMingen, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and
Sanbio, respectively.
Flow cytometric analysis. For FLT3 expression, 5  105 leukemia cells
were incubated with biotinylated FL for 1 h at 4jC followed by incubation
with avidin-FITC for 30 min at 4jC. As a negative staining control, anti-FL
blocking antibody was mixed with FL-biotin. For FL expression, cells were
incubated with biotinylated anti-FL antibody followed by incubation with
avidin-FITC. IgG-biotin was used for a negative staining control. These cells
were washed and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson).

[3H]thymidine uptake analysis. Leukemia cells (2.5  104 to 5  104
per well) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS in a
96-well flat-bottomed culture plate in triplicate in the presence or absence
of various concentrations of FL at 37jC for the indicated periods.
Subsequently, wells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 ACi/well) for 4 h,
after which the cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters. In some
experiments, a FLT3 kinase inhibitor, PKC412, was included at various
concentrations. [3H]thymidine incorporated to DNA was measured using a
liquid scintillation counter. Percentage stimulation was calculated as
follows: {[(cpm of treated) / (cpm of untreated)]
1}  100. Percentage
thymidine uptake was calculated as follows: {(cpm of treated) / (cpm of
untreated)}  100.
Cell cycle analysis. Leukemia cells (5  105/mL) were cultured in the
presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) for 3 days. These cells were pulsed
with BrdUrd for 30 min at 37jC and harvested. After fixation in 70% ethanol
on ice, cells were treated with RNase (Funakoshi) for 15 min at 37jC, and
subsequently washed with 4 N HCl, 0.1 mol/L Na2B4O7, and 0.5% Tween 20.
Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody for 20 min at
37jC and then treated with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) for 20 min on ice.
The signals generated by FITC and propidium iodide were analyzed using a
flow cytometer.
Apoptosis analysis. Leukemia cells (5  105/mL) were incubated for
24 h in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) and then irradiated (4 Gy)
followed by culture for 48 h, or exposed to daunorubicin (10 ng/mL) or AraC
(200 nmol/L) for 48 h. Cells were then harvested and stained doubly with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (MEBCYTO Apoptosis
Detection Kit; MBL) at 37jC for 15 min in dark. Ten thousand events were
analyzed using a flow cytometer.
Western blot analysis. Leukemia cells were solubilized in lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.05% NaN3, 0.2 TIU/mL aprotinin, 1 Ag/mL
pepstatin A, 10 mmol/L iodoacetamide, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate]. SDS was added to the lysis buffer

at a final concentration of 0.1% for analysis of nuclear proteins. The lysates
were separated on a 6% to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing
conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were
incubated with various primary antibodies at 4jC overnight, and then with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated second antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. The detection of the bands was done using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Japan).
RNase protection assays. Leukemia cells (5  105/mL) were cultured in
the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h, and their total
RNAs were extracted. The RNase protection assay was done using [32P]UTPlabeled multiprobe template hCC-1 and the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase
Protection Assay system (PharMingen).
Dye-exclusion test. Leukemic cell lines (4  104/well) were precultured
in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) for 24 h, and then exposed to
daunorubicin (10–20 ng/mL) or AraC (200–400 nmol/L) for the indicated
hours. In some experiments, the human bone marrow–derived stromal cell
line KM-104 was used as the feeder. In analysis of primary samples,
leukemia cells (1  105/well) were precultured in the presence or absence of
FL (40 ng/mL) or KM-104 cells with or without anti-FL antibody for 24 h,
and then exposed to AraC (100 nmol/L) for 24 h. The numbers of living and
dead cells were counted by dye-exclusion test in triplicate after each of
culture conditions, and viability (%) and Dviability (treated viability
control viability) were calculated.
Statistics. The Mann-Whitney’s test was used for the comparison of the
differences in FLT3 expression among leukemic cell lines and fresh
leukemia cells, and unpaired t test for the comparison of the differences in
[3H]thymidine uptake and dye-exclusion analyses. Differences in the
Dviabilities of primary leukemia cells between culture conditions were
analyzed using the matched paired Wilcoxon’s test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
Surface expression of FLT3 in leukemic cell lines. Surface
expression of FLT3 in leukemic cell lines used in this study was first

checked. B-precursor cell lines (n = 18) expressed a considerable
amount of FLT3 on their surfaces (median 94.5%, range 22–99%) as
shown in Table 1, whereas T-lineage cell lines (n = 2) did not (<10%;
data not shown). There were no significant differences in
percentage of FLT3-positive cells between B-precursor cell lines
with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) MLL rearrangement (median of
positive population; 96.5% versus 89.0%). There were also no
significant differences in the FLT3 expression levels between
B-precursor cell lines with and without MLL rearrangement
(median of mean fluorescence intensity; 165.6 versus 170.7).
FL stimulation inhibits proliferation of MLL-rearranged
leukemia cells by induction of cell cycle arrest. To investigate
the biological effect of FL, 18 B-precursor leukemic cell lines were
incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of
FL for 72 h, and their [3H]thymidine uptakes were assayed in the
final 4-h incubation. As shown in Fig. 1A, three of four Ph1-positive
leukemic cell lines showed stimulative responses to FL in a dosedependent manner. Two of other four B-precursor cell lines
without MLL rearrangement also showed a marked stimulative
response to FL. Unexpectedly, however, all of the MLL-rearranged
cell lines with wild-type FLT3 (n = 9), irrespective of the types of
translocation, showed inhibitory responses to FL in a dosedependent manner as shown in Fig. 1B. The MLL-rearranged cell
line with a D835 mutation, KOCL-33, was not affected by the
addition of FL. The kinetics of [3H]thymidine uptakes after FL
stimulation (20 ng/mL) was next analyzed using representative cell
lines. The FL-induced inhibition in MLL-rearranged KOCL-51 and
KOCL-58 reached maximal levels between 48 and 96 h of culture,
whereas the FL-induced stimulation in KOPN-55bi (Ph1), KOPN-36
with t(1;19), and KOPN-70 (other B-precursor) peaked between 96
and 144 h of culture (data not shown). These results indicate that,

cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or

the presence of cycloheximide, and harvested at
indicated time points. Changes in the p27 expression
were measured by densitometry and half-life of
p27 was calculated. Data are representative of
three separate experiments. C, Western blot
analysis of changes in phosphorylation of STAT5,
MAPK, and Akt after FL stimulation. KOCL-58
cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence or
absence of FL (20 ng/mL). D, Western blot analysis
of changes in STAT5 phosphorylation after FL
stimulation. KOCL-58 cells were incubated for 1 or
3 h in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL).

in contrast to other types of leukemia cells, proliferation of MLLrearranged leukemia cells with wild-type FLT3 is specifically
suppressed by ligand activation of FLT3.
To determine whether the inhibitory effect of FL is dependent on
the kinase activity of FLT3, MLL-rearranged KOCL-58 cells were
cultured with or without FL (20 ng/mL) for 72 h in the presence of
various concentrations of the FLT3 kinase inhibitor PKC412. As
shown in Fig. 1C, PKC412 alone inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake of
KOCL-58 cells, as previously reported (21). Of note, thymidine
uptake, which was inhibited by FL to 47.8% of the control level, was
restored to 62.3% in the presence of 50 nmol/L PKC412, a
concentration that can markedly suppress FLT3-mediating signal
transduction molecules such as STAT5, MAPK, and Akt (Supplementary Fig. S1). This result suggests that the kinase activity of
FLT3 is required for the FL-induced growth inhibition exhibited by
MLL-rearranged leukemia cells.
To investigate the mechanism of the FL-induced growth
inhibition seen in MLL-rearranged cell lines, cell cycle analysis
was done at 72 h after FL treatment (20 ng/mL) using the BrdUrd/
propidium iodide double staining method (Fig. 1D). In both KOCL58 and KOCL-51 cell lines, the population in S phase after FL
stimulation significantly decreased compared with that measured
without FL stimulation with a concomitant increase in the
population in G0-G1 phase. The population of cells in G2-M phase
remained unchanged after FL stimulation. Importantly, the

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptotic population, which appears in the hypodiploid region,
did not increase in either cell line. These results were consistently
observed in three separate experiments, indicating that the
FL-induced growth inhibition seen in MLL-rearranged cell lines
results from induction of G0-G1 arrest, but not from apoptosis.
Phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5, MAPK, and Akt is
transiently up-regulated after FL stimulation in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. It is known that FLT3 is dimerized after FL
stimulation, and this evokes biological effects through the signaling
pathways acting via STAT5, RAS/p44/42 MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (26–28). To investigate activation patterns of
signaling pathways after FL stimulation in MLL-rearranged cell
lines, changes in phosphorylation of STAT5, MAPK, and Akt in
KOCL-58 cells were pursued by Western blot using antibodies
against the phosphorylated (active) form of these molecules. FLT3
phosphorylation was examined using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after FLT3 immunoprecipitation. FLT3, STAT5, MAPK, and
Akt were constitutively phosphorylated before FL stimulation as
we reported previously (20), and their phosphorylation was further
up-regulated within 1 min after FL stimulation (100 ng/mL) and
returned to the prestimulated level at 15 min (Supplementary
Fig. S2). A similar pattern of changes in phosphorylation of these
molecules after FL stimulation was observed in KOPN-70, which
showed a stimulative response to FL in the [3H]thymidine uptake
assay (data not shown), suggesting that an opposite biological

effect of FL, that is, stimulation or suppression of cell growth, is not
simply due to differences in an early event of signaling after the FL/
FLT3 interaction.
FL stimulation markedly up-regulates p27 expression in
MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. It is known that cell cycle
progression is controlled primarily by activities of CDKs that are
up-regulated or down-regulated by cyclins and CDK inhibitors
(CDKI), including p16, p21, and p27, respectively. To examine the
expression of these cell cycle-associated proteins after FL
stimulation, KOCL-58 cells (5  105/mL) were cultured 48 h in
the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL). As shown in Fig. 2A
(left), expression levels of cyclins A, B, D3, and E, and CDK2, CDK4,
and CDK6, were completely unchanged. Expression of p16 was not
detected as reported previously (23). Although expression of p21
was modestly up-regulated by FL, this was not seen consistently in
repeated experiments. Of interest, expression of p27 was consistently and markedly up-regulated in the presence of FL. This p27
up-regulation was observed in a dose-dependent manner in
response to FL, and reached a maximum level at 100 ng/mL
(Fig. 2A, top right). In other experiments, it was shown that p27
was maximally up-regulated at FL concentrations between 20 and
40 ng/mL. Moreover, the FL-induced p27 up-regulation 48 h after
FL stimulation was also observed to varying degrees in other MLLrearranged cell lines with wild-type FLT3, but not in KOCL-33 with
a D835 mutation (Fig. 2A, bottom right). Importantly, the FLinduced up-regulation of p27 was more profoundly observed in
KOCL-58 and KOCL-50, which showed a marked suppression of
[3H]thymidine uptake by FL than in KOCL-45 and KOPN-1, which
showed a modest suppression of [3H]thymidine uptake by FL. In
KOPN-55bi, KOPN-70 without MLL rearrangement that showed
stimulative responses to FL, the p27 expression was somewhat
down-regulated after FL stimulation.
To determine the mechanism of the FL-induced p27 upregulation, changes in p27 mRNA expression after FL stimulation
were examined in KOCL-58 by RNase protection assay. The level of
p27 mRNA was completely unchanged after FL stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that p27 up-regulation might
be mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism. To determine
p27 stability, KOCL-58 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence
or absence of FL (20 ng/mL), further cultured after the addition of
cycloheximide (150 Ag/mL), and harvested 3, 6, and 9 h later. As
shown in Fig. 2B, the estimated half-life of p27 was elongated from
2.6 h in the absence of FL to 3.9 h in the presence of FL. These
results suggest that up-regulation of p27 induced by FL is due to
suppression of its protein degradation.
Phosphorylation of STAT5 is specifically abrogated after FL
stimulation in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. To determine
the activation status of FLT3-mediating signaling pathways at the
time point where p27 is up-regulated by FL stimulation, KOCL-58
cells were cultured in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) for
48 h, and phosphorylation of STAT5, MAPK, and Akt was examined.
As shown in Fig. 2C, in contrast to marked phosphorylation of
STAT5 seen after 48 h of culture without FL, the addition of FL to
the culture completely abrogated its phosphorylation. In contrast,
phosphorylation of MAPK was up-regulated in the presence of FL
at this time point, whereas phosphorylation of Akt showed no
difference in the two culture conditions. This STAT5 dephosphorylation was observed in KOCL-58 within 1 h after FL stimulation
(Fig. 2D). These results suggest that, among FLT3-mediating
signaling pathways, the STAT5 pathway is specifically suppressed
after FL stimulation.

FL stimulation renders MLL-rearranged leukemic cells
resistant to anti-leukemic agent–induced apoptosis. It is
thought that sensitivity of leukemia cells to irradiation and
chemotherapeutic agents is reduced in ‘‘dormant’’ cells whose cell
cycle progression is kept in sustained suppression. To assess
whether the FL-induced cell cycle arrest affects sensitivity to
irradiation-induced apoptosis, MLL-rearranged KOCL-58 and
KOCL-51 cells (both possessing wild-type p53) were precultured
for 24 h in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) and then
irradiated (4 Gy). Induction of apoptosis was examined after 48 h of
culture in the presence or absence of FL using FITC-conjugated
Annexin V and propidium iodide. As shown in Fig. 3A (left), the
Annexin V–positive apoptotic population decreased by FL from
45.3% to 24.5% in KOCL-58 and from 43.0% to 26.0% in KOCL-51.
The propidium iodide–positive late apoptotic population also
decreased in the presence of FL in both cell lines, suggesting that
irradiation-induced apoptosis is effectively suppressed by pretreatment with FL followed by subsequent stimulation with FL.
Similarly, to assess whether the FL-induced cell cycle arrest affects
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agent–induced apoptosis, KOCL-58
cells were precultured in the presence or absence of FL (20 ng/mL)
for 24 h, and then exposed to daunorubicin (10 ng/mL) or AraC
(200 nmol/L) for 48 h in the presence or absence of FL. As shown in
Fig. 3A (right), the Annexin V–positive population decreased by FL
from 38.1% to 20.5% in daunorubicin-treated cells and from 64.3%
to 47.3% in AraC-treated cells. These results suggest that ligand
activation of FLT3 in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells renders them
resistant to irradiation- and chemotherapeutic agent–induced
apoptosis.
To further evaluate the antiapoptotic activity of FL against
chemotherapeutic agents in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells, KOCL58 cells (4  104/well) were precultured for 24 h in the presence
or absence of FL (20 ng/mL) and then cultured for 3 days with
or without the addition of daunorubicin (10 ng/mL) or AraC
(200 nmol/L). Numbers of living and dead cells were determined
by the dye-exclusion method at days 2, 3, and 4 after the start of
preculture (Fig. 3B). In the culture without the addition of
daunorubicin or AraC (top), cell proliferation was gradually
inhibited (f50% inhibition at day 4) in the presence of FL. Of
note, in the culture to which either daunorubicin (middle) or AraC
(bottom) was added, an increase in the dead cell population was
markedly suppressed in the presence of FL (f50% suppression at
days 3 and 4). The FL-mediating suppression of cell death was
similarly observed at a higher concentration of daunorubicin or
AraC (Fig. 3C). Thus, it was largely estimated that IC50 of
daunorubicin and AraC was shifted by FL from 10 to 20 ng/mL
and from 200 to 400 nmol/L, respectively. Of importance, the FLinduced inhibition of proliferation and resistance to AraC were
specifically canceled by the addition of neutralizing anti-FL
antibody in the culture medium (Fig. 3D, left). This FL effect was
not observed in KOCL-33 with a D835 mutation (data not shown).
These results indicate that the chemotherapeutic agent–induced
apoptosis is suppressed in vitro via the interaction of FL with wildtype FLT3 in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells.
Coculture with bone marrow stromal cells renders MLLrearranged leukemia cells chemoresistant, which is canceled
by anti-FL antibody. Because FL is reported to be expressed at
high levels as a soluble or membrane-bound form by bone marrow
stromal cells (29), MLL-rearranged leukemia cells adhering to bone
marrow stromal cells might be induced to cell cycle arrest via the
FL/FLT3 interaction, resulting in acquisition of resistance to

antileukemic agents. Using the bone marrow stromal cell line KM104 expressing FL at high levels as the membrane form
(Supplementary Fig. S4), we thus did the in vitro model study.
KOCL-58 cells (4  104/well) were precultured for 2 days with or
without KM-104 cells growing confluent on the bottom of the plate
in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-FL antibody
(4 Ag/mL), and then cultured in the presence or absence of AraC
(200 nmol/L) for 2 days. As shown in Fig. 3D (right), the AraCinduced cell death was markedly (P < 0.01) suppressed when
cocultured with stromal cells. Of importance, this stromal cell
effect was partially but significantly canceled by anti-FL antibody
in the culture medium, indicating that the FL/FLT3 interaction
between MLL-rearranged leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal
cells contributes, at least in part, to induction of cell cycle arrest of
leukemia cells showing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
FL stimulation renders primary MLL-rearranged leukemic
cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agent–induced cell death.
To examine whether FL effect is also observed in primary MLLrearranged leukemia cells, peripheral or bone marrow mononuclear cells (blasts >90%) stored in liquid nitrogen were thawed and
used for experiments. Characteristics of primary leukemia samples
with (n = 9) or without (n = 5) MLL rearrangement are summarized
in Table 2. MLL-rearranged primary leukemia cells expressed FLT3
at significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels than did those without MLL
rearrangement (median of positive population; 76% versus 25%;
median of mean fluorescence intensity; 64.5 versus 30.4). Primary
leukemia cells (1  105/well) were precultured for 24 h in the
presence or absence of FL (40 ng/mL), further cultured for 24 h with
AraC (100 nmol/L) in the presence or absence of anti-FL antibody
(4 Ag/mL), and harvested. As representatively depicted in Fig. 4A
(case 1), the addition of FL rendered MLL-rearranged primary
leukemia cells resistant to AraC, which was partially but

significantly (P < 0.05) canceled by anti-FL antibody. The viabilities
(%) after 48 h culture in 14 cases with or without MLL rearrangement are summarized in Table 2. Of note, the viabilities after
AraC exposure significantly (P < 0.05) increased by the addition of
FL in five of seven primary leukemia cells with MLL rearrangement,
but not in five of five primary leukemia cells without MLL
rearrangement. This FL effect was specifically canceled by anti-FL
antibody in all of the cases tested. Statistically, the Dviabilities
(treated viabilities
control viabilities) after AraC exposure
significantly (P < 0.05) increased by the addition of FL, which
was canceled by the addition of anti-FL antibody (Fig. 4B).
In six cases with MLL rearrangement, leukemia cells (1  105/
well) were precultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of
KM-104 cells with or without anti-FL antibody and further cultured
for 24 h with AraC (100 nmol/L). As representatively depicted in
Fig. 4A (case 8), coculture with bone marrow stromal cells rendered
MLL-rearranged primary leukemia cells resistant to AraC, which
was partially but significantly canceled by anti-FL antibody. The
Dviabilities after AraC exposure significantly (P < 0.05) increased in
the presence of stromal cells, which was canceled by the addition
of anti-FL antibody (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that stimulation
by FL, irrespective of its soluble or membrane form, specifically
renders primary MLL-rearranged leukemia cells resistant to
chemotherapeutic agent–induced cell death.

Discussion
MLL-rearranged infant ALL is known to have an especially poor
prognosis (30), although its prognosis has gradually improved by
intensified chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (31–33). Nowadays, the complete remission rate in MLLrearranged ALL after the induction chemotherapy has improved to

FL-Induced Quiescence in MLL-Rearranged Leukemia

Figure 4. Effect of FL as a soluble or membrane form on chemotherapeutic agent–induced cell death of MLL -rearranged primary leukemia cells. MLL -rearranged
primary leukemia cells (1  105/well) were precultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of FL (40 ng/mL) or bone marrow stromal (KM-104) cells with or
without the addition of anti-FL antibody (4 Ag/mL), and then cultured with or without AraC (100 nmol/L) for 24 h. Numbers of living and dead cells were counted
in triplicate by dye-exclusion test and viabilities were calculated. The D viability (treated viability control viability) was also calculated in each culture condition.

MRD in MLL -rearranged leukemia. MLL -rearranged leukemia cells not adhering to bone marrow stromal cells are entering cell cycle and considerably sensitive
to chemotherapy, but those adhering bone marrow cells are quiescent and resistant to chemotherapy, at least in part via the interaction of FL/FLT3, which results
in persistent MRD. The FLT3 inhibitor might be effective by two mechanisms in vivo: one directly induces apoptosis of leukemia cells and another awakens
quiescent leukemia cells adhering to bone marrow stromal cells to enter cell cycle.

a greater than 90%; the most dismal clinical issue in this disease is
an early relapse that frequently occurs during the first 6 months of
chemotherapy and before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(34), resulting in shorter event-free survival and overall survival.
Recently, the prognostic value of MRD after induction chemotherapy has been emphasized in childhood ALL (35, 36). Although the
importance of MRD is not fully characterized yet in MLLrearranged ALL, persistence of high levels of MRD in bone marrow
should be associated with a high and early relapse rate in this
disease.
We found that MLL-rearranged leukemia cells with wild-type
FLT3 showed an inhibitory response to FL. This FL-induced
inhibition was due to the induction of cell cycle arrest, in the

www.aacrjournals.org

process of which up-regulation of p27 and dephosphorylation of
STAT5 might be implicated profoundly. Importantly, these arrested
leukemia cells, not only established lines but also primary samples,
showed resistance to apoptosis after exposure to irradiation or
chemotherapeutic drugs. Because FL is reported to be expressed at
high levels as a soluble or membrane-bound form by bone marrow
stromal cells (29), it is postulated that MLL-rearranged leukemia
cells tightly adhering to bone marrow stromal cells are induced to
cell cycle arrest via the FL/FLT3 interaction, which might lead
leukemia cells to become ‘‘dormant cells’’ that are resistant to
antileukemic agents. In addition, the serum level of FL is reported
to increase dramatically in patients who experience chemotherapyinduced bone marrow suppression (37). Therefore, leukemia cells

in patients after intensified chemotherapy are speculated to be
exposed to high level of FL not only in bone marrow but also in the
periphery. We showed in the in vitro model study that MLLrearranged leukemia cells adhering to the stroma cell line partially
restored sensitivity to antileukemic agents in the presence of antiFL antibody. In AML, it has been reported that leukemia cells
acquire resistance to AraC and daunorubicin via the interaction of
VLA4 expressed on AML cells with fibronectin expressed on bone
marrow stromal cells (38). This VLA4/fibronectin interaction was
confirmed to play a pivotal role in MRD of AML in both the animal
model and the clinical study showing a poor prognosis of VLA4positive AML compared with a good prognosis of VLA4-negative
AML (38). We thus present the hypothesis as illustrated in Fig. 4D,
postulating that MLL-rearranged leukemia cells not adhering to
bone marrow stromal cells are sensitive to chemotherapy, but
those adhering to bone marrow stromal cells are rendered resistant
to chemotherapy, at least in part via the interaction of FL/FLT3,
which results in persistent MRD that is closely associated with the
high relapse rate of this disease. According to this scenario, the
FLT3 kinase inhibitors, such as PKC412, should be effective in vivo
in the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia because they can
exert their inhibitory action through two mechanisms: one directly
induces apoptosis of leukemia cells via blockade of the kinase
activity required for their survival as recently reported (21, 22, 39)
and another awakens ‘‘dormant’’ leukemia cells and induces them
to enter a chemosensitive cell cycling state via blockage of the
signal through the FL/FLT3 interaction that occurs on the surfaces
of leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal cells. The cell surface
adhesion molecule VCAM-1 or asparagine synthetase, expressed on
or secreted from bone marrow stromal cells, respectively, have also
been reported to be involved in resistance to chemotherapy in ALL
cells (40, 41).
The precise molecular mechanism of the FL-induced cell cycle
arrest in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells remains elusive. We found
that p27 is markedly up-regulated after FL stimulation, and this
was presumably due to prevention of degradation of this protein in

MLL-rearranged leukemia. As a key member of the KIP/CIP family
of CDKIs, p27 blocks cell cycle progression at G1 phase, primarily
by inhibiting the cyclin E/CDK2 complex (42, 43). It is known that
p27 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that
quiescent cells exhibit a smaller amount of ubiquitinating activity
(44), which might account for prolongation of the p27 half-life in
FL-treated MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. Therefore, it is not clear
at present whether up-regulation of p27 is the primary molecular
event in FL-induced cell cycle arrest, or it is a secondary event in
quiescent (‘‘dormant’’) cells occurring after cell cycle arrest has
been induced by other molecular mechanism(s). We also found that
phosphorylation of STAT5, but not p44/42 MAPK and Akt, was
almost abolished in arrested MLL-rearranged leukemia cells after
FL stimulation. Because selective activation of STAT5 is shown to
play a pivotal role in the self-renewal of leukemic cells as well as in
normal hematopoiesis (45), the specific inactivation of STAT5 after
FL stimulation might be critical to the induction of cell cycle arrest.
The molecular mechanism of FL-induced STAT5 inactivation is still
elusive and will be the subject for the future study.
The most important issue to be addressed is why MLLrearranged ALL cells, unlike other B-precursor ALL cells, show a
inhibitory response in proliferation after FL stimulation. Analyses
of gene expression in leukemia have provided direct insights into
the pathogenesis of leukemias and their responses to therapy.
Armstrong et al. (19) reported that MLL-rearranged ALL has a
distinct gene expression profile, including high FLT3 expression
compared with other types of ALL. Thus, specific genes and their
products that are uniquely activated in MLL-rearranged leukemia
might be associated with a unique inhibitory response to FL.
