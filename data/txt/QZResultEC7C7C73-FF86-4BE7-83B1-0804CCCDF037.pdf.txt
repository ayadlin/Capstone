Abstract
Androgens regulate the development and function of male
reproductive organs and play a crucial role in the onset and
progression of prostate cancer. Androgen action is primarily
mediated through the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) which
acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. This mode of
androgen action takes hours to manifest and is called the
genomic pathway. The androgen-mediated genomic responses
require activity of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein
kinase (PKA). Androgens also act through nongenomic pathways in certain cell types to evoke rapid responses (manifested
in minutes) that are mediated through changes in ion currents
and second messengers. Here, we show that androgen causes
the rapid and cAMP-dependent activation of PKA in prostate
cells. The androgen-induced PKA activation is not inhibited by
nuclear AR antagonist bicalutamide and can be observed in
cells that do not express nuclear AR gene. Reduction of GAs
expression with siRNA attenuates the androgen-mediated
activation of PKA, which is required for the androgen-induced
prostate cell proliferation. We conclude that androgen actively
evokes a nongenomic signaling pathway to activate PKA that
is needed for the genomic functioning of nuclear AR. The
inhibition of PKA activation, together with standard ARtargeted therapies, may be more efficacious for treatment of
patients with prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3225–31]

Introduction
Androgens manifest their effects on target cells by binding the
androgen receptor (AR), which plays a critical role in normal
development of the prostate gland as well as the initiation and
progression of prostate cancer. Indeed, mainstay treatment of
locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer is achieved with
endocrine therapies aimed to (a) decrease circulating androgen
levels via chemical or physical castration (1) and (b) block AR
activation with antiandrogens (2). The AR is a ligand-activated
transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of male sex
steroids in the target cells by activating transcription of androgenregulated genes. Upon ligand binding, the AR dimerizes, translocates into the nucleus, binds to androgen response elements
(specific DNA sequences situated in the promoter/enhancer
regions of target genes), and associates with various regulatory

proteins and members of the transcription initiation complex to
initiate transcription (3). This is the classic view of AR signaling or
the ‘‘genomic pathway.’’ This mode of androgen action requires
hours to manifest fully and can be inhibited by agents that block
gene transcription or protein translation (4).
Emerging evidence indicates that stimulation with androgens can
also initiate rapid (manifested in minutes), nongenomic signaling
events such as increased intracellular Ca+2 in skeletal muscle cells
(5), activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in
skeletal muscle or sertoli cells (5, 6), and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in osteoblasts (7). The signaling steps involved in
the nongenomic actions of androgen are not understood completely;
however, they are likely mediated through multiple, cell type–specific
mechanisms. Significantly, the nongenomic action of androgen may
or may not involve nuclear AR. For instance, the androgen-mediated
activation of ERK in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer
cells seems to require nuclear AR (8), whereas the release of
intracellular Ca+2 in skeletal muscle cells (5) or IC21 macrophages (9)
occurs through nuclear AR-independent mechanisms. It is possible
that these nongenomic actions of androgen contribute to and/or
complement the genomic responses mediated through the classic
pathway. In support of this view, a recent report suggested that
genomic nuclear AR function (to mediate cell proliferation) requires
nongenomic activity of AR to activate c-Src (10).
We previously showed that androgen-mediated activation of
nuclear AR (through the genomic pathway) is dependent on the
activation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA;
ref. 11). However, it is not known whether the existing pool of
activated PKA inside the cell is used for this purpose or if androgen
stimulation per se provokes PKA activation. In this study, we tested
the hypothesis that androgen activates PKA in prostate cells. We
show that androgen promotes the PKA activation via a signaling
cascade that involves heterotrimeric Gs protein, adenylyl cyclase,
and cAMP but is independent of nuclear AR. We also find that PKA
activity is required for the androgen-induced activation of nuclear
AR and proliferation of prostate cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. Androgen-dependent LNCaP, prostate
epithelial RWPE1, and mouse macrophage IC21 cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. The androgen-dependent
LAPC4 and androgen-independent PC3M prostate cancer cells were
generous gifts from C. L. Sawyers (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
New York, NY) and P. Kelly (Duke University, Durham, NC), respectively.
LNCaP, LAPC4, and IC21 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 1.26 g/L glucose. The
PC3M cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, and 10 mmol/L HEPES. The RWPE1 cells were cultured in
keratinocyte serum-free medium (Life Technologies-Bethesda Research
Laboratories) supplemented with 5 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal
growth factor and 0.05 mg/mL bovine pituitary extract. Cells at f60% to

80% confluence were used for transfection in 100-mm dishes using the
appropriate cDNAs and transfection reagents (DMRIE-C for LNCaP and
LAPC4 cells; lipofectamine for PC3M and RWPE1 cells). After transfection,
cells were equally divided to ensure the identical cell populations. The
agonist-regulated cell proliferation was determined by counting cells using
trypan blue and hemocytometer, as previously described (12).
DNA constructs. Mammalian expression plasmids encoding phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D, Flag epitope-tagged vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), and the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of
Axin were kindly provided by R. J. Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC)
and J. S. Gutkind (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Plasmids encoding AR reporters
(ARR2-luciferase or probasin-luciferase) were described before (11). Two
different siRNA duplexes were designed using the OligoEngine siRNA design
tool based on sequence of the long and short isoforms of Gas mRNAs. The
sequence of shRNA 1625 was 5¶-GATCCCCCAAACAACTCCAGGACGAATTCAAGAGATTCGTCCTGGAGTTGTTTGTTTTTA-3¶, and the sequence of
shRNA 2051 was 5¶-GATCCCCCCAGCTGATTGACTGTGCCTTCAAGAGAGGCACAGTCAATCAGCTGGTTTTTA-3¶. Complementary oligomers
were annealed and cloned into pSUPER vectors obtained from OligoEngine,
according to their instructions.
PKA assay. LNCaP cells were grown in 60-mm plates to f60% to 80%
confluence and starved overnight in phenol red–free RPMI containing 0.1%
(w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cells were stimulated for 10 min with
androgen [including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that we
used interchangeably], or isoproterenol that we used as a positive control.
Ethanol at 0.1% (v/v) was used as a vehicle control. After stimulation, cells
were washed with PBS and lysed in extraction buffer containing 25 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, 10 Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol,
aprotenin, and leupeptin. PKA activity was determined by measuring the
transfer of 32P from [g32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific
PKA peptide substrate (Upstate). The reaction mixture contained 0.1 mmol/
L ATP (Sigma), 10 Amol/L [g32P]ATP, 50 Amol/L PKA substrate, 25 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 20 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10 AL of crude cell
lysate. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 30jC and was
terminated by adding 20 AL of 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. To assay PKA
activity, 35 AL of reaction mixture was spotted on cellulose phosphate
membranes (Whatman P81) that were prewashed thrice ( for 10 min each)
using 1% H3PO4 and once with distilled water. The filters were air dried and
counted in a scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2700 TR; Packard). In each set of
experiments, a PKA-positive control [in which f25 ng of pure PKA (Sigma)
was added instead of extract] and two negative control (enzyme control and
substrate control) reactions were set up to ascertain specificity of results.
The assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least thrice to
calculate SEs.
cAMP assay. LNCaP cells were seeded equally in 24-well plates and
allowed to grow overnight. The cells were starved for 2 to 4 h followed by
stimulation for 10 min at 37jC with the indicated concentration of ligand.
Cells were washed using PBS and lysed using 0.1 N HCl, and the cAMP assay
was performed using the correlate-EIA direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay
kit (Assay Designs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
assay was performed in duplicate and repeated thrice.
AR reporter assay. Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding
luciferase gene under control of AR (ARR2 or probasin; 1 Ag) and SV40Renilla luciferase (10 ng). At the end of transfection, cells were divided
equally into 24-well plates, allowed to attach for 24 h, and the culture
medium was replaced with starvation medium [phenol red–free RPMI 1640
containing 0.1% BSA, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mmol/L HEPES
buffer (pH 7.5)]. Identical cell populations, in triplicates, were cotreated
with rolipram (100 nmol/L) or H89 (10 Amol/L) together with androgen for
24 h. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using the dual
luciferase assay kit (Promega) and were normalized by the Renilla luciferase
activities and protein concentrations of the samples (11).
Immunoblotting. Appropriately treated cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v)
Nonidet P40, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium PPi, 100 Amol/L Na3VO4,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL

aprotinin, and 0.7 Ag/mL pepstatin] and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting (10, 12). M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and
anti-Gas polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem) were used at a dilution of
1:5,000 and 1:1,000, respectively.
Immunostaining. LNCaP cells grown on glass coverslips were treated
with H89 (10 Amol/L) and androgen for 24 h, and fixed and processed for
immunostaining with 1:200 dilution of anti-prostate–specific antigen (PSA)
antibody (11, 12). Specific signal was visualized with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine,
and cells were counter stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to
visualize nuclei.

Results
Androgen activates PKA. In monkey kidney CV1 (13) and
prostate cancer LNCaP (14) cells, the AR can be aberrantly
transactivated (i.e., in the absence of exogenous androgens) by the
PKA activator forskolin. Furthermore, forced expression of the
catalytic subunit of PKA in the CV1 cells leads to activation of AR
in the absence of added androgen (13). Importantly, PKA activation
seems to be required for classic androgen-mediated activation of
nuclear AR in prostate cancer cells (11). Just how PKA becomes
activated to control the androgen-mediated activation of AR
remains undetermined. We tested whether direct stimulation with
androgen (including testosterone and DHT) could activate PKA.
LNCaP cells were treated with escalating concentrations of
androgen for 10 min at 37jC, and cell extracts were obtained
and used for in vitro PKA kinase assay that measures transfer of 32P
from [g32P]ATP to a specific PKA peptide substrate. Testosterone
induced the concentration-dependent increase in PKA activity with
maximal (35% above basal) effects achieved at 1 Amol/L (Fig. 1A),
consistent with a receptor-mediated signaling event.
We used isoquinoline H89 (15) as a diagnostic tool to assess
specificity of the testosterone-mediated activation of PKA.
Exposure of the LNCaP cells to H89 inhibited, in a dose-dependent
manner, the testosterone-mediated activation of PKA (Fig. 1B),
with a total inhibition of PKA activity achieved at a H89
concentration of 10 Amol/L. The VASP protein serves as a
substrate for PKA (16), and we used VASP phosphorylation in
intact cells as another measure to confirm the androgen-mediated
activation of PKA. Consistent with the in vitro PKA kinase results
(Fig. 1A and B), treatment of LNCaP cells with testosterone
promoted VASP phosphorylation (Fig. 1C ), that was dosedependently inhibited by H89 (Fig. 1D).
Androgen causes the cAMP accumulation. Although activation of PKA often occurs due to accumulation of intracellular
cAMP (17), some studies have reported cAMP-independent
mechanisms to activate PKA (18–20). Stimulation with testosterone
consistently induced the modest but significant increases in cAMP
formation (Fig. 2A). Stimulation of cells with isoproterenol served
as a positive control. To gain more confidence in these results, and
to directly implicate cAMP in the androgen-mediated activation of
PKA, we assessed effect of expressing the selective cAMP-degrading
enzyme PDE4D (21). Transient expression of PDE4D in LNCaP cells
abrogated the isoproterenol- and androgen-mediated VASP phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These results show that androgen promotes
the intracellular accumulation of cAMP that is needed for PKA
activation (11).
GAs mediates PKA activation by androgen. The a subunit of
heterotrimeric Gs proteins (Gas) is the best studied receptorinduced regulator of cAMP-generating enzymes, adenylyl cyclases.
However, the adenylyl cyclases may also be activated by receptorindependent events such as the direct binding to forskolin (22). To

with testosterone for 10 min, lysed, and cell lysates were used for in vitro PKA kinase assay. B, H89 inhibits testosterone-mediated PKA activation. LNCaP cells
were pretreated with H89 for 30 min, stimulated with testosterone (1 Amol/L) for 10 min, and in vitro PKA kinase assay performed, as described. C, testosterone
stimulates the dose-dependent increase in VASP phosphorylation. LNCaP cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding Flag-VASP (1 Ag/100-mm dish) and stimulated
with testosterone or isoproterenol (10 Amol/L) for 10 min. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with M2 anti-Flag antibody. P-VASP and VASP indicate, respectively,
the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of VASP proteins. D, H89 inhibits testosterone-mediated phosphorylation of VASP. LNCaP cells expressing

determine whether androgen-induced cAMP accumulation occurred in a Gas-dependent manner, Gas-specific siRNAs were
designed and used to knock down expression of the Gas proteins.
LNCaP cells were transfected with Flag-VASP and plasmids
expressing Gas siRNAs (1625 and 2051) that were synthesized
based on the sequence of the long and short isoforms of Gas
mRNAs. Forced expression of the Gas siRNAs reduced expression
of Gas protein in LNCaP cells by >50% but showed no measurable
effect on the expression of clathrin heavy chain protein (Fig. 3A).
Importantly, expression of the Gas siRNAs inhibited the VASP
phosphorylation induced by both isoproterenol (Fig. 3B) and
androgen (Fig. 3C), compared with cells that were transfected with
an unrelated siRNA. Contribution of Gas to androgen-induced PKA
activation was confirmed through the forced expression of Gas
signaling inhibitor, RGS domain of Axin (Fig. 3D). Together, these
results clearly indicate involvement of Gas protein in androgenmediated PKA activation.
Nuclear AR is not required for androgen-mediated PKA
activation. Nuclear AR has been shown to transduce some, but not
all, of the nongenomic actions engendered by androgens (8, 9). We
determined the androgen-induced VASP phosphorylation using
LNCaP cells pretreated with nuclear AR antagonist bicalutamide.
No consistent change in VASP phosphorylation status was observed
in the presence of 10 Amol/L bicalutamide (Fig. 4A), suggesting
nuclear AR-independent activation of PKA. However, the similar
treatment of LNCaP cells with bicalutamide (10 Amol/L) abrogated
the androgen-regulated transcriptional activity of nuclear AR as
determined by expression of PSA protein (data not shown). To
strengthen the argument that androgen activates PKA in a nuclear
AR-independent manner, we made use of IC21 macrophages that
do not express nuclear AR gene (9). The IC21 cells were starved,

stimulated with androgen for 10 min at 37jC, and PKA activity was
determined. Treatment of the IC21 cells with androgen, like the
treatment with isoproterenol, promoted the PKA activation (data
not shown). Together, these results show that androgen-induced
PKA activation does not require nuclear AR.
Androgen activates PKA in prostate epithelial cells. To
ascertain generality of the androgen-mediated activation of PKA, we
determined effect of androgen stimulation on VASP phosphorylation using two additional prostate cancer cell lines (androgendependent LAPC4 and androgen-independent PC3M) and one
normal prostate epithelial (RWPE1) cell line. Similar to the situation
in LNCaP cells, stimulation with androgen, including BSAconjugated testosterone (BSA-T) and free testosterone, like the
treatment with isoproterenol, induced the PKA activation in these
cells as well (Fig. 4B). Stimulation of the prostate cells with estradiol
or BSA-conjugated estradiol did not effect the PKA activity (data not
shown). Significantly, results using the PC3M cells that do not
express endogenous nuclear AR gene reinforce the idea that
androgen stimulation activates PKA independently of nuclear AR.
Androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells promotes the cAMP
accumulation (Fig. 2A) and PKA activation (Fig. 1). Androgen
stimulation also promotes the LNCaP cell proliferation via a
signaling cascade that uses nuclear AR (23). We therefore asked
whether cAMP and PKA contribute to the nuclear AR activation
and subsequent cell proliferation. Inhibition of PDE activity
with rolipram increased levels of intracellular cAMP (data not
shown) and PKA activity (Fig. 5A), and potentiated the androgeninduced nuclear AR activation (Fig. 5B). The mechanism of
rolipram-mediated AR activation remains unclear but may involve
PKA. Accordingly, treatment of cells with H89 abolished the
androgen-induced nuclear AR activation as determined with

expression of PSA (Fig. 5C), confirming previous observations (11,
13, 14). To test whether PKA is involved in the androgen-induced
LNCaP cell proliferation, cells were treated, or not, with H89
followed by stimulation with vehicle alone, or together with
androgen. Figure 5D illustrates that treatment with H89 abolished
the androgen-induced LNCaP cell proliferation. Together, these
results are consistent with the idea that androgen stimulation

promotes the PKA activation that, in turn, is required for nuclear
AR function to regulate prostate cell proliferation.

a major role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer via

activation of cognate ARs. The main venue for androgen effects on
target cells comprises nuclear AR, which acts as a ligand-controlled
transcription factor to regulate expression of specific genes involved
in cell growth and differentiation. The major finding of this study is

that in addition to eliciting genomic responses, androgen
stimulation initiates rapid, nongenomic signals to activate PKA
that is needed for the proper functioning of nuclear AR as a
transcriptional regulator (11–13). As depicted schematically in

Figure 6. A model for androgen-mediated activation of
PKA. In the classic paradigm, testosterone transverses
the plasma membrane into the cytosol and is
converted to DHT that, in turn, binds to and activates
nuclear AR (pathway 1). Testosterone may transverse
the plasma membrane and directly bind to adenylyl
cyclase (pathway 2), in a manner similar to forskolin.
Alternatively, testosterone may activate PKA by
binding to plasma membrane- or cytosolic vesicle–
expressed AR that couples to Gas (pathway 3), in a
manner similar to the h2 adrenergic receptor. AC,
adenylyl cyclase; ARBP, AR-binding protein; FSK,
forskolin.

Fig. 6, the signaling intermediates that connect androgen and PKA
include heterotrimeric Gas protein, adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, and
PKA.
The results offer three possibilities to account for the androgenmediated activation of PKA (Fig. 6). First, the nongenomic
responses of androgens may be mediated through nuclear AR
(6, 8), and previous studies have shown that the nuclear AR can be
found in lipid rafts that are specialized domains of the plasma
membrane (24). We can exclude this possibility based on the
observations that androgen activates PKA in cells pretreated with
the nuclear AR antagonist bicalutamide and, more to the point,
androgen activates PKA in IC21 macrophages and PC3M cells
that do not express nuclear AR gene. Second, androgen directly
activates adenylyl cyclases, in a manner similar to forskolin
(Fig. 6, pathway 2). We tested this possibility using purified
membranes expressing various reconstituted adenylyl cyclases,
including isoforms 1, 2, 4, and 5 (a generous gift from C. W.
Dessauer, University of Texas, Houston, TX) and observed that the
stimulation with androgen, unlike forskolin, does not increase levels
of cAMP (data not shown). These observations argue against the
direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by androgen. Third, androgen
may cause PKA activation via the binding to a Gs protein–coupled
receptor (GPCR), in a manner similar to the h2 adrenergic receptor
(Fig. 6, pathway 3). Indeed, the best studied physiologically relevant
cellular mechanism to activate PKA involves a signal transduction
cascade composed of a GPCR ! Gas ! adenylyl cyclase ! cAMP
! PKA, and our data show that the reduction of Gas expression
with siRNA or inhibition of Gas signaling with the RGS domain of
Axin attenuates androgen-induced PKA activation. Furthermore,
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activation with 2¶-5¶-dideoxyadenosine
(a generous gift from R. Johnson, State University of New York, Stony
Brook, NY) as well as expression of the cAMP-degrading enzyme
PDE4D abrogated the androgen-induced PKA activation. Together,
these results establish that androgen generates the Gas/adenylyl
cyclase/cAMP-dependent signalsome to activate PKA.
The physiologic concentrations of testosterone vary widely in
body tissues. Normal prostate tissue contains 1.2 ng/g DHT and
cancer tissue contains 4.8 ng/g (25, 26). Prostate fluid obtained
from patients with prostate hypertrophy contained 54 ng/mL DHT

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

and 106 ng/g testosterone (27). Recent studies show that testicular
androgen concentration in humans is 1,236 F 86 nmol/L
compared with 11.7 F 0.7 nmol/L in serum (28). More than 70%
of this androgen is biologically active and essential for spermatogenesis (6). One of the pathways that is triggered by this ‘‘high’’
testosterone concentration in sertoli cells induces the nongenomic
activation of ERK and cAMP-responsive element binding protein
(6). Hence, in our study, the androgen concentrations used fall
within the physiologic concentration range present in testes.
Recent studies have shown that nongenomic action of estrogen
is mediated through the GPCR GPR30 that is chiefly expressed
intracellularly on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (29, 30).
An intracellular GPCR located on an organelle membrane can be
functional only if the cognate ligand is capable of transversing the
plasma membrane. Stimulation with membrane-impermeable BSAT induced the Gas-dependent PKA activation (Fig. 4B), suggesting
existence of a plasma membrane–anchored AR (Fig. 6). However,
careful analysis of the BSA-T revealed that it contained free
testosterone. Hence, two possibilities exist to account for
subcellular localization of the Gas-coupled AR (Fig. 6): The
receptor may be expressed on the plasma membrane such as
the progestin receptor (31) or in vesicles in the cytosol such as the
estrogen receptor (29, 30).
The androgen-mediated activation of PKA is not cell type
specific. We can detect the PKA activation in androgen-dependent
(LNCaP and LAPC4) and androgen-independent (PC3M) prostate
cancer cells, as well as in noncancerous prostate epithelial
(RWPE1) cells, establishing generality of the pathway. Notably,
androgen-independent prostate cancer DU145 cells did not show
significant PKA activation after androgen treatment. Previous
studies have shown that DHT induced cAMP accumulation and
PKA activation by binding to sex hormone–binding globulin
(SHBG) and acting through the SHBG receptor (32). However, the
androgen-induced PKA activation that we observed seems to be
independent of SHBG. First, considerable amounts of exogenous
SHBG (50 nmol/L) were needed to initiate the DHT/SHBG-induced
activation of PKA (32). In our case, experiments were performed in
serum-free medium in the absence of exogenously added SHBG,
and similar results were obtained when experiments were carried

out in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum. Moreover, the
deprivation of cells from serum for up to 3 days had no effect on
the androgen-induced activation of PKA. Second, the DHT/SHBGmediated activation of SHBG receptor to activate PKA was shown
to occur only in cancer but not benign prostate cells (33). We
showed that stimulation of benign prostate RWPE1 epithelial cells
(and IC21 macrophages) with androgen induces the PKA
activation.
Based on our results, and taking into consideration previous
findings demonstrating requirement of PKA to propagate nuclear
AR function (11–13), we propose presence of a Gas-coupled
androgen binding sites that transduce rapid, nongenomic signals
to activate PKA. We further suggest existence of parallel androgen
effector pathways; a nongenomic pathway that activates PKA (Fig. 6,
pathway 3) and a genomic pathway that is mediated through

Activation of PKA is required for the androgen-mediated activation
of nuclear AR genomic function. Identification and further
characterization of the G protein–coupled AR will enhance our
knowledge of nongenomic signals by androgens and may serve as a
drug target for the blockade of (both genomic and nongenomic)
pathophysiologic signaling pathways triggered by androgens.
