ABSTRACT
High hyperdiploidy (HD), the most common cytogenetic subtype of B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), is largely curable but significant treatment-related
morbidity warrants investigating the biology and identifying novel drug targets.
Targeted deep-sequencing of 538 cancer-relevant genes was performed in 57 HD-ALL
patients lacking overt KRAS and NRAS hotspot mutations and lacking common B-ALL
deletions to enrich for discovery of novel driver genes. One-third of patients harbored
damaging mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes, including the putative novel
driver DOT1L (n=4). Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway
mutations were found in two-thirds of patients, including novel mutations in ROS1,
which mediates phosphorylation of the PTPN11-encoded protein SHP2. Mutations in
FLT3 significantly co-occurred with DOT1L (p=0.04), suggesting functional cooperation
in leukemogenesis. We detected an extraordinary level of tumor heterogeneity, with
microclonal (mutant allele fraction <0.10) KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and/or PTPN11 hotspot
mutations evident in 31/57 (54.4%) patients. Multiple KRAS and NRAS codon 12 and
13 microclonal mutations significantly co-occurred within tumor samples (p=4.8x10-4),
suggesting ongoing formation of and selection for Ras-activating mutations. Future
work is required to investigate whether tumor microheterogeneity impacts clinical
outcome and to elucidate the functional consequences of epigenetic dysregulation in
HD-ALL, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION

related morbidity and mortality, including secondary
cancers, cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease
[2, 3]. A fuller understanding of the genomic landscape
driving leukemogenesis in HD-ALL may inform the
biology of this disease and potentially reveal novel
therapeutic strategies.
Hyperdiploidy has been shown to arise prenatally
[4, 5] and is likely initiated by a single abnormal mitotic
event [6, 7], implicating it as the primary genetic lesion.

High hyperdiploidy (HD), characterized by
a non-random pattern of chromosomal gains (51 to
67 chromosomes), comprises the largest cytogenetic
subgroup of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
and is one of the most common malignancies in children
[1]. Although HD usually confers a favorable prognosis,
survivors of childhood ALL have long-term treatmentwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

This is followed by additional somatic alterations, arising
pre- or postnatally, and these are believed to be required
for overt leukemia. Distinct characteristics of HD-ALL
have been highlighted both by studies of heritable and
acquired genetic alterations. Genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified SNPs that distinguish
HD-ALL from other subtypes, for example in ARID5B,
CEBPE, and PIP4K2A [8-11]. Similarly, a distinct pattern
of somatic mutations characterizes HD-ALL. For instance,
frequency of common childhood ALL gene deletions,
including CDKN2A, IKZF1, and PAX5, is relatively low
[12], whereas activating mutations in receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK)/Ras/MAPK signaling genes KRAS, NRAS,
FLT3, and PTPN11, are relatively common [13-15].
Indeed, recent next-generation sequencing analyses of
HD-ALL confirmed that mutations in these genes, and
in the epigenetic regulatory gene CREBBP, are the most

frequent somatic alterations in this leukemia subtype [16,
17]. Here, we describe targeted sequencing of 538 cancerrelevant genes using a clinical sequencing platform in a
set of 57 HD-ALL patients lacking the common KRAS and
NRAS codon 12 and 13 hotspot mutations and common
gene deletions, to enrich for discovery of novel driver
genes and to assess recurrently-mutated pathways in
HD-ALL tumorigenesis. This deep-sequencing enabled
identification of putative novel drivers and permitted an
in-depth assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity.

RESULTS
Deep-sequencing of 538 cancer-relevant genes

quality sequencing data were obtained for each patient,
with a mean coverage of 596X and an average of 94.3%
reads with > 100X coverage. After removal of low quality
variants, known polymorphisms, and likely germline
mutations (based on mutant allele fraction, MAF), there
were 108 variants predicted to be damaging (CADD
Phred score ≥ 20) at 97 unique loci, including 90 SNVs
and 7 INDELs (Figure 1). On average, patients harbored a
median of only 1 mutation (range: 0-8) (Table S2), with no
correlation between age-at-diagnosis and total number of
mutations (R2 < 0.01). The most recurrently mutated genes
included the RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway genes
FLT3 (n = 12), PTPN11 (n = 12), KRAS (n = 9), NRAS (n
= 5), and the epigenetic regulator CREBBP (n = 5) (Figure
2). No novel hotspot mutations (i.e. recurrently mutated
nucleotides) were identified. A descriptive summary of the
predicted damaging mutation loci can be found in Table
S2.
Based on DNA availability, we attempted to validate
62 mutations in recurrently mutated genes in the RTK/
Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and involved in epigenetic
regulation, including likely germline mutations. We
successfully validated 60 out of 62 mutations (96.8%)
in tumor DNA by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The 2
mutations that were not validated had MAF < 15% in the
deep-sequencing, potentially explaining our inability to
detect them via Sanger sequencing. Nineteen of the 62
mutations were also confirmed in matched germline DNA
samples and, except for one mutation with MAF = 0.43,
these had been predicted “likely germline” based on MAF.

In total, two-thirds (38/57) of HD-ALL patients
carried a predicted damaging and somatic mutation in at
least one RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway gene (Figure
S1). Twelve patients harbored a total of 15 mutations in
FLT3, including 12 point mutations, one in-frame deletion
of codon I836, and 2 internal tandem duplications (ITD)
at the juxta-membrane region in exon 14. Six of the point
mutations detected within FLT3 were novel mutations
in ALL (Figure S2), of which 2 (I867N and M664I)
were in codons in which different amino acid-altering
mutations were recently identified in HD-ALL [17], with
the remaining 4 located in codons known to be mutated
in AML. These novel mutations all lie within known
mutational hotspot regions within or just upstream of the
tyrosine kinase domain. In addition, we identified a FLT3
mutation Y842C with MAF = 0.49 that was confirmed as
a germline mutation via Sanger sequencing of remission
DNA (Figure S2).
In PTPN11, one of the 9 mutation loci (F71L)
was previously found in AML but not ALL according
to COSMIC, though this mutation lies within one of the
mutational hotspot regions in the N-terminal SH2 domain
(Figure S3). The mutation P491L had MAF = 0.49 and
was possibly germline, however constitutive DNA was
not available for this patient to confirm this. In KRAS,
we identified mutations at codon 146 (n = 4) and codon
117 (n = 1) (Figure 2, Figure S4). Subclonal mutations

Epigenetic regulatory genes

(MAF < 0.30) were also detected at codons 12 and 13
in 4 patients. In NRAS, mutations were found at known
ALL hotspots at codons 61 (n = 4) and 146 (n = 1) (Figure
S5). Additional likely-somatic damaging mutations were
identified in the Ras homolog gene MRAS (n = 1), the
leukemia oncogene CBL (n = 1), the MYC oncogene (n =
1), and in the receptor tyrosine kinase genes ROS1 (n = 2),
ERBB2 (n = 1), EPHB1 (n = 1), FGFR1 (n = 1), FGFR4
(n = 1), and IGF1R (n = 1). Mutations in KRAS, NRAS,
FLT3, and PTPN11 were largely mutually exclusive,
with 38 mutations detected across 34 patients compared
with a predicted distribution of 26±3.7 based on 10,000
permutations (p = 1.4x10-5; Z-score = 4.18). Of 38 patients
with RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway mutations,
there were a total of 52 unique mutations. These were
significantly mutually exclusive, with a distribution of 38
compared with a predicted distribution of 29.9±4.6 (p =
8.2x10-5; Z-score = 3.77) (Figure S1).

Predicted damaging and somatic mutations in
epigenetic regulators were detected in one-third (19/57)
of HD-ALL patients (Figure S6). CREBBP mutations
were the most frequent (n = 5), including previously
unreported nonsense and missense mutations in the
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain. Another patient
had a splicing mutation within the HAT domain in the
closely related gene EP300 (Figure 3). DOT1L was also
recurrently mutated (n = 4), including 3 mutations in
the highly-conserved S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)dependent methyltransferase domain with CADD Phred
scores > 30, with an additional mutation adjacent to
the AdoMet domain and also predicted to be highly
deleterious (CADD Phred = 29.5) (Figure 3). Predicted
damaging somatic mutations were also identified in
TRAPP (n = 3) (Figure S7), and one each in WHSC1,
NCOR1, KMT2D, DNMT3A, EZH2, HIST1H1C, SETD2,
and TAF1. There was significant mutual exclusivity for

significantly co-occurred with DOT1L mutations, with 16
mutations across 13 patients (Figure 2) compared with
a predicted distribution of 14.6±0.8 (p = 0.04; Z-score
= -1.76). Further, PTPN11 mutations were significantly
mutually exclusive of epigenetic gene mutations (as a
group), with 31 mutations across 29 patients compared
with a predicted distribution of only 25.0±2.2 (p = 3.4x103
; Z-score = 2.70). A similar trend was seen for KRAS (p
= 0.12) and NRAS (p = 0.07) but not for FLT3 (p = 0.49).

Epigenetic gene mutations were more frequent in
patients with somatic FLT3 mutations than in patients

Tumor microheterogeneity

subclonal, and/or microclonal mutations at hotspot loci
in KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, or PTPN11. Further, we found
a substantial proportion of patients with epigenetic
regulatory gene mutations, including in the putative novel
driver gene DOT1L, and these typically co-occurred with
mutations in FLT3.
We confirmed the high frequency and mutual
exclusivity of mutations in FLT3, PTPN11, KRAS, and
NRAS [13]. In KRAS, we verified that codon 146 and 117
mutations, recently identified by Paulsson et al. (2015)
[16], are hotspot loci in HD-ALL. Indeed, 7 patients
harbored microclonal mutations at one of these two loci
(Figure S8). FLT3 and PTPN11 mutations were more
frequent than previously reported, likely due to our patient
selection criteria. We identified 6 novel mutations in FLT3
and one novel mutation in PTPN11, in known activating
hotspot regions but not previously detected in ALL. We
also made the unexpected discovery of a likely causal
germline FLT3 mutation at Y842C. This same amino acid
change was previously identified in tumor DNA from a
non-hyperdiploid ALL patient [18], and was reported as
an activating mutation in AML [19]. Recent analysis of
germline mutations in childhood cancers identified a FLT3
frameshift mutation in a child with E2A-fusion ALL [20].
However, to our knowledge this is the first report of a
germline FLT3 mutation in HD-ALL. Germline PTPN11
mutations cause Noonan syndrome [21], therefore this
patient may present with RASopathy-related phenotypes
given that somatic mutations in FLT3 and PTPN11
activate the Ras/MAPK pathway and are largely mutually
exclusive in ALL. However, clinical data were not
available to confirm this.
Though we enriched for discovery of novel driver
genes in HD-ALL, few novel recurrently mutated RTK/
Ras/MAPK signaling genes were identified. Somatic
alterations of ROS1 have previously been detected in
lung cancer and glioblastoma [22, 23], and we found
ROS1 mutations in a small fraction of HD-ALL patients.
ROS1 protein mediates phosphorylation and increases
activation of the PTPN11-encoded protein SHP2, and
ROS1 activation can induce tumorigenesis [24]. Thus, the
mutations we identified are potentially gain-of-function,
suggesting that a subset of ALL patients could be treated
with ROS1 inhibitors such as crizotinib [25] or foretinib
[26].
The identification of subclonal KRAS codon
12 and 13 mutations in our initial analyses led us to
investigate microclonal mutations (MAF < 10%) at
ALL hotspot loci in KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, and
CREBBP. Utilizing the high-coverage sequencing data
we revealed an extraordinary level of intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, with microclonal Ras pathway
hotspot mutations detected in over 50% of patients.
Adjacent microclonal mutations never appeared on the
same sequencing reads and, therefore, appear to have
arisen in distinct clones within tumor samples, supporting

We identified 65 minor subclonal, or “microclonal”,
hotspot mutations at known mutation hotspot loci in KRAS
(patient n = 21), NRAS (n = 17), FLT3 (n = 4), PTPN11 (n
= 7), and CREBBP (n = 3) (Figure 4, Figure S8, Table S3).
Median MAF of these mutations was 0.012 (range: 0.0030.096). Of the 16 mutation loci assessed, only FLT3 codon
663, PTPN11 codon 69, and the negative control NRAS
codon 117 did not harbor any microclonal mutations.
Analysis of flanking sequences at the 65 microclonal
hotspot mutations revealed only 5 additional mutations
that qualified as microclonal in 3250bp (65 x 50bp) of
sequence, thus 99.8% of flanking sequences did not harbor
such mutations.
In total, there were 32 patients with microclonal
mutations, of which 31 (54.4%) had at least one mutation
in KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and/or PTPN11. We assessed
intra-sample tumor microheterogeneity and identified 16
patients with multiple microclonal mutations, including
10 patients carrying mutations in both KRAS and NRAS
and 4 patients with mutations in at least 3 of the genes
analyzed (Figure 4, Figure S8, Table S3). There was a
highly significant co-occurrence of microclonal mutations
in KRAS and NRAS codons 12 and 13, with 28 mutations
found in only 19 patients compared with a predicted
distribution of 23.8±2.1 (p = 4.8x10-4; Z-score = -3.3)
(Figure S8). There was no significant difference between
age-at-diagnosis in patients with microclonal hotspot
mutations (mean = 4.67 yrs) and those without (mean =
4.89 yrs) (p = 0.77).
In addition, there were 8 patients with multiple
microclonal mutations at the same hotspot locus, either in
adjacent nucleotides within the same codon or in adjacent
codons (Figure S9, Table S4). Five patients had adjacent
KRAS hotspot mutations and 3 patients had adjacent
NRAS mutations, including one patient with two codon
12 mutations (MAF = 2.9% and 5.1%) and one codon 13
mutation (MAF = 5.5%). In all 8 patients, these concurrent
nucleotide changes occurred on different sequencing
reads (p = 7.8x10-3, binomial significance test, 2-tailed),
indicating that they were part of distinct tumor subclones
(Table S4).
Including all identified clonal, subclonal, and
microclonal mutations, there were 43 HD-ALL patients
(75.4%) with a damaging mutation in KRAS, NRAS, FLT3,
and/or PTPN11, and 8 patients (14.0%) with a damaging
CREBBP mutation (Figure 4).

required to elucidate the role of DOT1L in HD-ALL.
Recent studies have shown that mutations in other
epigenetic regulator genes, in particular the histone
acetyltransferase CREBBP, are common in childhood
ALL [16, 17]. We identified novel nonsense and HAT
domain mutations in CREBBP, one of which (Y1503H)
was previously reported in lymphoma [43]. Mutations
in the H3K36 methyltransferase gene WHSC1 were also
recently reported in HD-ALL [16, 17]. In our patients, we
did not detect the SET domain hotspot mutation at E1099
[16] but did find another SET domain mutation T1150A
that was recently reported in B-ALL [30] and shown to
have increased methyltransferase activity in mantle cell
lymphoma [44]. We also identified novel mutations in
TRRAP, a component of HAT complexes.
Only a fraction of known epigenetic regulatory genes
were sequenced, thus it is likely that a higher proportion
of HD-ALL tumors may suffer epigenetic perturbation.
A recent study of over 1000 pediatric cancer genomes,
including leukemias but not HD-ALL, revealed significant
variation in frequency of epigenetic regulator mutations
across tumor types [45]. Our data suggest that epigenetic
dysregulation may be prominent in HD-ALL. One
explanation is that hyperdiploidy leads to overexpression
of tumor suppressor genes, which requires downregulation
via epigenetic silencing. Indeed, some genes positioned
on gained chromosomes in HD-ALL show decreased
expression that is associated with hypermethylation
[46, 47]. Alternatively, epigenetic dysregulation may be
required for oncogene overexpression, supported by lower
mean methylation levels in HD-ALL relative to other
subtypes [46, 48], in particular on gained chromosomes
[48, 49]. Drugs targeting epigenetic modifications, such
as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [50], are being
explored as treatment options in ALL and might prove
particularly effective against the HD-ALL subtype.
It was interesting to note that DOT1L mutations
significantly co-occurred with mutations in FLT3.
Moreover, epigenetic regulatory gene mutations were
more frequent in patients harboring FLT3 mutations than
in patients with PTPN11, KRAS, or NRAS mutations,
which tended to be mutually exclusive of epigenetic
mutations. These could be a chance finding given the
relatively small numbers, although FLT3 mutations in
AML frequently co-occur and functionally cooperate
with mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes [33, 51-53].
Future studies should investigate whether FLT3 activation
cooperates with epigenetic dysregulation in ALL, which
might suggest a potential use for combination treatment
using FLT3 inhibitors with epigenetic therapies, as
recently proposed for AML [54].
There are some caveats to consider when
interpreting results from this study. First, the sequencing
was limited to 538 genes included in the UCSF500
Cancer Gene panel and, though these are thought to be
the most frequently mutated cancer genes, we may have

that the formation and selection of such hotspot mutations
is ongoing. Further, the significant co-occurrence of
KRAS and NRAS codon 12 and 13 microclonal mutations
suggests the existence of a highly-heterogeneous subset
of Ras-driven leukemias. Alternatively, these may not be
driven by Ras pathway activation but by clonal mutations
in other pathways that reduced the selective advantage of
Ras mutant clones. These two possibilities are evidenced
by a lack of clonal RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling gene
mutations in the 9 patients with concurrent microclonal
Ras codon 12/13 mutations, which included 2 patients
harboring microclonal mutations at 4 different loci (Figure
S8).
Microclonal Ras mutations have previously been
reported in ALL and other tumor types [27, 28]. In a study
of relapsed ALL, microclonal KRAS and NRAS mutations
were detected in diagnostic DNA in over 50% of patients
found to be wildtype by Sanger sequencing [27]. These
patients had Ras mutations at relapse, suggesting that the
microclonal mutations evaded initial treatment and drove
the relapsed ALL [27]. Similarly, CREBBP HAT domain
mutations are enriched in relapsed HD-ALL [17, 29-31].
Whether microclonal Ras or CREBBP mutations confer
a similar risk of relapse to the more clonal mutations
remains to be determined.
Mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes comprise a
substantial portion of the mutational landscape of several
hematologic malignancies, including T-ALL [32], AML
[33], and B-cell lymphomas (reviewed in Lunning and
Green [34]). We identified a high frequency and mutual
exclusivity of epigenetic regulator mutations in HD-ALL,
supporting a biological role for epigenetic dysregulation
in this leukemia subtype [35] and that multiple possible
genetic lesions may generate this disruption. Clustered
damaging mutations discovered in the histone 3 lysine 79
(H3K79) methyltransferase gene DOT1L strongly support
this as a driver of leukemogenesis. The only previously
reported DOT1L mutation in childhood ALL was also in
a HD patient, with a V114F mutation in close proximity
to the AdoMet domain [36], suggesting DOT1L mutations
may be specific to the HD subtype. In infant ALL, MLLfusion proteins recruit DOT1L protein leading to H3K79
hypermethylation and increased expression of MLL target
genes [37]. In contrast, DOT1L deficiency is associated
with hyperploidy in vitro, likely due to aberrant mitotic
spindle formation [38-40]. In mice, DOT1L knockout
resulted in downregulation of GATA2 and differentiation
towards the myeloid lineage during hematopoiesis [41].
We recently proposed that heritable risk alleles in CEBPE,
a modulator of myelopoiesis, may increase ALL risk via
lineage confusion [11]. Polymorphisms in CEBPE were
more strongly associated with HD-ALL, supporting that
de-differentiation of pre-B cells towards the myeloid
lineage may be a hallmark of hyperdiploidy. DOT1L is
also thought to play a role in double-strand break DNA
repair and cell cycle control [42], thus more research is

missed potential driver mutations in genes not included
on the panel. However, recent whole-genome and exome
sequencing studies of HD-ALL did not identify any driver
mutations in genes missing from our analyses [16, 17].
Clinical information, such as rate of relapse and outcome
data, was unfortunately not available for the patients in
this study. In addition, the exclusion of patients harboring
common gene deletions precluded analysis of whether
copy number alterations co-operate with mutations in Ras
pathway or epigenetic regulatory genes in ALL. Therefore,
next-generation sequencing of large numbers of unselected
HD-ALL patients with available clinical data will be
required to elucidate all possible leukemogenic pathways
and the implications of particular clonal and microclonal
mutations on patient outcomes.

Conclusions

Targeted sequencing of cancer genes

Deep-sequencing of HD-ALL genomes has revealed
extensive tumor heterogeneity at both the clonal and
microclonal level, highlighting the importance of RTK/
Ras/MAPK signaling pathway activation and epigenetic
dysregulation in HD leukemogenesis. The identification
of putative novel driver genes DOT1L and ROS1 demands
further investigation into potential novel and targeted
treatment strategies, such as ROS1 inhibition [26].
Targeting epigenetic modifications has been suggested
as a new therapeutic option in ALL [30, 50]. Moreover,
future work is required to investigate whether tumor
microheterogeneity should impact therapeutic regimens
in childhood ALL.

A summary of subject selection is included in the
Supplementary Methods. In brief, 57 HD B-ALL patients
with neither Ras codon 12/13 hotspot mutations nor
common ALL deletions, as assessed by Sanger sequencing
and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
respectively, were selected for deep-sequencing of
cancer-relevant genes to enrich for discovery of novel
driver mutations (Figure 1). NimbleGen SeqCap EZ
libraries were used for capture of 538 genes included in
the “UCSF500 Cancer Gene Panel” (Table S1). Library
preparation was carried out according to manufacturer’s
protocol. DNA samples were barcoded and pooled for
multiplexed sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500
platform, with sequencing carried out to ~600X depth.
Sequencing data analysis and variant filtering for predicted
damaging SNVs and INDELs are described in detail in
the Supplementary Methods and summarized in Figure
1. Briefly, to exclude likely germline polymorphisms we
filtered out variants present in dbSNP or with a minor
allele frequency > 0.01% (i.e. > 0.0001) in the Exome
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Database. Predicted
damaging mutations were identified using the Combined
Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) tool version
1.3 (http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score) [57]. A CADD
Phred score threshold of ≥ 20 (i.e. top 1% deleterious
variants in the genome) was used, as recommended for
discovery of causal variants.
Given that targeted deep-sequencing data was
not created from matched germline DNA samples, our
variant filtering methods would not exclude rare germline
variants. Thus, we used a mutant allele fraction (MAF)
threshold of ≥ 0.45 to define “likely germline” variants.
Due to the high frequency of chromosomal gains in HDALL, chromosome copy number must be considered
when assessing clonality of mutations. For each patient,
chromosomal copy number was inferred from sequencing

Ethics statement
This study was reviewed and approved by
institutional review committees at the University of
California Berkeley, the California Department of Public
Health (CDPH), and all collaborating institutions. Written

participants.

Study subjects
Subjects included in this study were enrolled in
the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) as
previously described [55]. The initial set of patients
comprised 457 newly-diagnosed B-ALL patients with
cytogenetic subtype information, who were born in
California and had diagnostic bone marrow samples
available. These included 146 HD-ALL patients, of
which 52.6% of patients were Hispanic and 33.6% were

data using the CNVkit software [58]. Whole chromosome
gains were determined using mean log2 copy ratio and
visual confirmation of copy number scatter plots. We then
adjusted the MAF of each mutation based on copy number
of the chromosome carrying that mutation, and based on
the assumption that chromosomal gains occurred prior
to development of somatic mutations. Hence, a mutation
with MAF = 0.33 that was located on a chromosome with
copy number of 3 would have an adjusted MAF of ~0.49
and, thus, was likely a germline variant that was present
on a non-gained chromosome.
Sanger sequencing was carried out to validate
a subset of mutations of interest (see Supplementary
Methods and Table S2). Where available, remission DNA
or neonatal bloodspot DNA was used to determine whether
mutations were germline or somatic. Mutations were
assessed in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
(COSMIC, http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) [59] and in data
from two recent sequencing studies of HD-ALL [16, 17],
to determine whether they were previously identified in
ALL or other cancer types. Clonal mutations were defined
as those with MAF ≥ 0.30, and subclonal mutations
with MAF ≥ 0.10 and < 0.30, following adjustment
for chromosome copy number. Minor subclonal (i.e.
microclonal) mutations were defined as having MAF <
0.10.

mutated ( ≥ 1 patient) in our initial analysis of VCF data,
including: KRAS codons 12, 13, 61, 117, and 146; NRAS
codons 12, 13, 61, and 146; FLT3 codons 663 and 835;
PTPN11 codons 61, 69, and 72; and CREBBP codon
1446. We also included NRAS codon 117 as a negative
control, as this is not known to be mutated in ALL. Each
patient BAM file was imported into the GenomeBrowse
software (Golden Helix), and visual examination of the
hotspot mutation loci was carried out. Inclusion criteria
for microclonal mutations were nucleotide changes that
were: 1) Nonsynonymous; 2) Present in ≥ 3 reads (i.e. >
approximately 0.5% reads); 3) Present in both forward and
reverse sequencing directions; and 4) Reads with mean
base Phred quality score ≥ 30. To assess the validity of
our methods, we counted the number of “non-hotspot”
microclonal mutations in the 50bp immediately flanking
each microclonal hotspot mutation (25bp up-/downstream)
in patients harboring these mutations, relative to the total
number of basepairs examined.
We observed several instances where ≥ 2
microclonal mutations in the same patient were present
at adjacent nucleotides and/or in adjacent codons at the
KRAS or NRAS codon 12/13 locus. To determine whether
these mutations were likely in the same tumor clone or
not, we exported sequencing read data and examined
whether the adjacent nucleotide changes were present in
the same reads or in different reads.

Mutual exclusivity analysis

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Mutual exclusivity analysis was carried out using
Gitools (version 2.2.3) [60]. We included all genes in
which ≥ 1 patient carried a predicted damaging somatic
mutation. Mutation data were imported for all 57 patients,
with a linear score corresponding to the mutant allele
fraction as calculated from the reference:alternative allele
ratio. Six patients carried 2 mutations in the same gene,
and these mutations were grouped for each patient. Mutual
exclusion analysis was carried out for genes in the RTK/
Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and for those involved in
epigenetic regulation, as well as for microclonal mutations.
Observed distribution of mutations across patients (i.e.
number of columns with a mutation) was compared to
the expected distribution, and a Z-score obtained through
10,000 permutations, maintaining the number of “events”
(i.e. mutations) per row and with weighted permutations
for columns, as developed by Perez-Llamas, et al. [60].
P-values reflect the significance of mutual exclusivity
derived from Z-scores.
