miRNAs are dramatically changed in different cell types and
different developmental stages, suggesting that miRNA plays a role
in cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death (1, 2).
miRNAs are aberrantly expressed or mutated in human cancer,
indicating that they may function as a novel class of oncogenes or
tumor suppressor genes (3–9). The first evidence of involvement of
miRNAs in human cancer came from molecular studies characterizing the 13q14 deletion in human chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, which revealed two miRNAs, miR-15a and miR-16-1 (3).
Subsequently, miRNA deregulation was detected in other human
malignancies, including breast carcinoma (4, 5), primary glioblastoma (6, 7), lung cancer (8), papillary thyroid carcinoma (9), colon
carcinoma (10), and pancreatic tumors (11, 12). For instance, the
miR-17-92 cluster is up-regulated in B-cell lymphomas and lung
cancer. miR-143 and miR-145 are down-regulated in colon
carcinomas. A decrease in let-7 is detected in human lung
carcinomas and restoration of its expression induces cell growth
inhibition in lung cancer cells (13). The BIC gene, which contains
the miR-155, is up-regulated in some Burkitt’s lymphomas and
several other types of lymphomas (14, 15).
In this report, we show deregulation of several miRNAs in human
ovarian cancer. The aberrant expression of miR-214, miR-199a*, miR200a, and miR-100 was detected in a near or over half of ovarian
cancers, especially in late-stage and high-grade tumors. Significantly,
we showed that miR-214 negatively regulates PTEN by binding to its
3¶-UTR leading to inhibition of PTEN translation and activation of
Akt pathway. Consequently, miR-214 induces cell survival and
cisplatin resistance, which were overridden by either small-molecule
Akt inhibitor or expression of PTEN cDNA lacking 3¶-UTR.

Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) represent a novel class of genes that
function as negative regulators of gene expression. Recently,
miRNAs have been implicated in several cancers. However,
aberrant miRNA expression and its clinicopathologic significance in human ovarian cancer have not been well documented. Here, we show that several miRNAs are altered in
human ovarian cancer, with the most significantly deregulated
miRNAs being miR-214, miR-199a*, miR-200a, miR-100, miR125b, and let-7 cluster. Further, we show the frequent
deregulation of miR-214, miR-199a*, miR-200a, and miR-100
in ovarian cancers. Significantly, miR-214 induces cell survival
and cisplatin resistance through targeting the 3¶-untranslated
region (UTR) of the PTEN, which leads to down-regulation
of PTEN protein and activation of Akt pathway. Inhibition of
Akt using Akt inhibitor, API-2/triciribine, or introduction of
PTEN cDNA lacking 3¶-UTR largely abrogates miR-214–
induced cell survival. These findings indicate that deregulation of miRNAs is a recurrent event in human ovarian cancer
and that miR-214 induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance
primarily through targeting the PTEN/Akt pathway. [Cancer

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs, which are evolutionarily conserved and function as negative
regulators of gene expression. Like conventional protein-coding
mRNA, miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, spliced, and
polyadenylated (called primitive miRNA or pri-miRNA). However,
unlike mRNA, the pri-miRNAs contain a stem-loop structure that
can be recognized and excised by the RNA interference machinery
to generate hairpin ‘‘precursor’’ miRNAs (pre-miRNA) that are f70
nucleotides in animals or f100 nucleotides in plants. Pre-miRNAs
are cleaved by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer into a 22-nucleotide
miRNA duplex: one strand (miRNA*) of the short-lived duplex is
degraded, whereas the other strand serves as a mature miRNA. The
mature miRNA then guides a complex called miRNA-containing
ribonucleo-protein particles to the complementary site(s) in the
3¶-untranslated region (UTR) of a target mRNA. Consequently,
translation blockade or mRNA degradation will occur depending
on whether it is partially matched or completely matched with
the target genes, respectively (1). Moreover, the levels of individual

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and human tissue samples. Human ovarian cancer cell lines
and human immortalized ovarian surface epithelial (HIOSE) cell lines were
described previously (16). HIOSE cells were grown in 199/MDCB 105 (1:1)

primary ovarian tumor and normal ovarian tissues were obtained from the
Tissue Procurement Facility at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center.
miRNA array and Northern blot analysis. Oligonucleotide arrays were
printed with trimer oligonucleotide probes (antisense to miRNAs) specific
for 515 human and mouse miRNAs on GeneScreen Plus (NEN) membranes,
and miRNA expression profiling was performed and analyzed as previously
described (7). Briefly, total RNAs were isolated from 10 HIOSE cell lines and
10 primary serous ovarian carcinomas with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
Low-molecular weight RNAs were enriched from total RNAs using Microcon
YM-100 columns (Millipore). The low-molecular weight RNAs were labeled
with [g-32P]ATP and then hybridized to the miRNA array. To ensure
accuracy of the hybridizations, each labeled RNA sample was hybridized
with three separate membranes. In addition, eight oligonucleotides with
nonmatching any known miRNA were used as hybridization controls.

empty spots were measured. Raw data were further automatically processed
in Microsoft Excel. Hybridization signals that failed to exceed the average
background value by more than three SDs were excluded from analysis.
For Northern blot analysis, 20 Ag RNA was separated on 15% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel and then electroblotted onto a Zeta-Probe GT Blotting
Membrane (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, the membrane was dried and UV
cross-linked. The probes were prepared using the StarFire Oligonucleotide
Labeling System (Integrated DNA Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The blots were hybridized overnight at 50jC in a buffer
containing 5 SSC, 20 mmol/L Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 Denhardt’s,
and 0.2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA and then washed with 1 SSC/1% SDS
buffer at 50jC (13). The probe sequences are as follows: hsa-miR-199a*,
5¶-AACCAATGTGCAGACTACTGTA-3¶; hsa-miR-214 , 5¶-CTGCCTGTCTGTGCCTGCTGT-3¶; hsa-miR-100, 5¶-CACAAGTTCGGATCTACGGGTT-3¶;
and hsa-miR-200a , 5¶-ACATCGTTACCAGACAGTGTTA-3¶.
RNase protection assay and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.
Expression of miRNAs was also analyzed by RNase protection or mirVana
reverse quantitative transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) miRNA detection assay.
For RNase protection assay, enriched small RNA was purified using the
miRVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion). The mirVana miRNA probe
construction kit (Ambion) was used to synthesize the 32P-labeled miR-214
probe. Probe hybridization and RNase protection were then carried out
using the mirVana miRNA detection kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After hybridization and RNase treatment, the
double-strand products were resolved in a 15% polyacrylamide 8 mol/L urea
denaturing gel and visualized using phosphoimaging and autoradiography.
mirVana qRT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Ambion). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7.5%
polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 Tris-borate EDTA and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.
Antisense inhibition of miRNA expression. 2¶-O-methyl (2¶-O-me)
oligoribonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The
sequences of 2¶-O-me-anti-miR-214 and 2¶-O-me-anti-miR-199a* are as
follows: 5¶-CUGCCUGUCUGUGCCUGCUGU-3¶ and 5¶-AACCAAUGUGCAGACUACUGUA-3¶. 2¶-O-me-scrambled miR (5¶-AAAACCUUUUGACCGAGCGUGUU-3¶) was used as a control. Cells were grown in six-well plate (1.7  106
per well) for 24 h and transfected with 150 pmol/L/well of 2¶-O-me
oligoribonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000. RNA and protein were
extracted after 72 h of transfection.
Cloning and expression of miRNAs. Expression plasmids of miR-214
and miR-199a* were created by PCR amplification using human genomic DNA as a template. The primers are the following: miR-214 ,
5¶-CACCTTTCTCCCTTTCCCCTTACTCTCC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TTTCATAGGCACCACTCACTTTAC-3¶ (antisense), and miR-199a*, 5¶-CACCGCCCAGAAGCCACGATCCCAAACC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TGCCTTTCCCCAGTGCCTCTTCTC-3¶ (antisense). The PCR products (392 bp containing pri-miRNA)
were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo expression vector (Invitrogen)
and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression of miRNA was
carried out by transfection of the plasmid into the cells using Lipofectamine
2000.
Target in vitro reporter assay. For luciferase reporter experiments, the
3¶-UTR segments of PTEN predicted to interact with miR-214 were
amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA and inserted into the MluI
and HindIII sites of pGL3 vector immediately downstream from the stop
codon of luciferase (Promega). A2780CP and HIOSE-80 cells were
cotransfected in 12-well plates with 0.4 Ag of the firefly luciferase report
vector and 0.08 Ag of the control vector containing Renilla luciferase, pRLTK (Promega), as well as with or without 0.5 Ag of Topo-miR-214. Firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were measured consecutively using dualluciferase assays (16).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays. Cell viability was examined with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
as previously described (17). Apoptosis was detected with Annexin V and
caspase-3/7 activity (17, 18). For detection of caspase-3/7 activity, cells were
cultured in 96-well plates and treated with the agents indicated in the figure
legends and analyzed using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega) according

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analysis was done using twosample t test, assuming equal variance, and P value was calculated based on
two-tailed test.
miRNA locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue section. A miRNA locked nucleic acid (LNA)
probe was prepared by 3¶-end labeling with digoxigenin-ddUTP terminal
transferase using the Dig-3¶-End Labeling kit (Roche). Following deparaffinization and proteinase K digestion, slides were prehybridized for 1 h and
then hybridized with 10 nmol/L miRNA LNA probe in a hybridization buffer
(Roche) for 12 h. After three consecutive washes in 4 SSC/50% formamide,
2 SSC, and 0.1 SSC, sections were treated with a blocking buffer (Roche)
for 1 h and incubated with anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments (Roche) for 12 h.
Following wash for three times in 1 maleic acid and 0.3% Tween 20 buffer,
reactions were detected in a detection solution [100 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 9.5) and 100 mmol/L NaCl] in the presence of nitroblue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega) and then visualized under
a microscope.

Results
Frequent deregulation of miR-199a*, miR-214, miR-200a,
and miR-100 in human ovarian cancer. miRNA profiles have
been reported in different types of tumors derived from different
organs (3–12), including ovarian cancer (5). However, the frequency
and pathobiological significance of aberrant miRNA expression in
human ovarian cancer have not been well documented. We initially
analyzed miRNA expression in 10 human ovarian epithelial tumors
and 10 ‘‘normal’’ HIOSE cell line pools by hybridization of the array
containing 515 miRNAs. After normalization of control oligos, the
differential expression of miRNAs between ovarian tumors and
normal ovarian surface epithelial cells was quantified using a
phosphorimager. Thirty-six of the 515 miRNAs showed differential
expression with P values derived from the nonparametric
Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test being <0.05. Of them, 14 miRNAs
that changed >1-fold were confirmed by Northern blot and/or qRTPCR analysis (Fig. 1A and B; data not shown). To further validate
our results, miR-199a*, miR-214, miR-200a, and miR-100, four of the
most differentially expressed miRNAs, were analyzed in 30 primary
ovarian cancers (Table 1). As compared with normal ovarian cells,
more than half of the primary tumors exhibited elevated levels of
miR-199a* (53%, 16 of 30) and miR-214 (56%, 17 of 30) and downregulated miR-100 (76%, 23 of 30). Moreover, increased miR-200a
was detected in 43% of primary ovarian carcinomas examined
(Table 1). Further, although the number of specimens is relatively
small, the deregulation of miR-199a*, miR-214, and miR-200a seems
to be associated with high-grade and late-stage tumors (Table 2).
These data suggest that alterations of these three miRNAs could be
involved in ovarian cancer progression.
The miR-214 targets PTEN leading to activation of the Akt
pathway. Because miR-214 was one of the most frequently upregulated miRNAs in the ovarian tumors (Table 2; Fig. 1) and has
recently been shown to play an important role in zebrafish muscle
development (19), we next examined its potential targets by
searching the PicTar and miRBase database as well as sequence
alignment analysis using GCG version 11.1. Among the candidates
targeted, 3¶-UTR of human PTEN contains a putative region
(nucleotides 3257–3264, NM_000314) that matches to the seed
sequence of hsa-miR-214, which is also conserved in mouse and rat
(Fig. 2A). To examine whether PTEN is indeed the target of miR214, a miR-214–negative cell line HIOSE-80 (Figs. 2B and 3A) was
transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo-miR-214. The cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo vector alone and pcDNA3.1/V5His-Topo-miR-199a* were used as controls. Immunoblotting and

UTR) and mutated (pGL3-PTENmut-3¶-UTR) 3¶-UTR of PTEN
(Fig. 2A). Both the wild-type and the mutant reporters were
introduced into A2780CP (miR-214 positive) and HIOSE-80 (miR214 negative) cells, respectively. Luciferase activity of the wild-type,
but not mutant, PTEN-3¶-UTR reporter was significantly suppressed in miR-214–positive A2780CP cells but not in miR-214–
negative HOSE-80 cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-214 in
HIOSE-80 cells inhibited the wild-type but not the mutated
reporter activity (Fig. 2C).
Having observed that miR-214 negatively regulates PTEN in cell
culture system, we asked if this regulation is seen in vivo. Inverse
correlation of expression of PTEN and miR-214 was investigated in

RT-PCR analyses revealed that PTEN protein but not mRNA was
considerably decreased in miR-214–transfected HIOSE-80 cells
(Fig. 2B). In contrast, knockdown of miR-214 by 2¶-O-me miR-214
in A2780CP cells, which express high levels of endogenous miR-214
(Fig. 3A), increased the protein level of PTEN (Fig. 2B). Further, the
phosphorylation levels of Akt, a major target of PTEN (20), and Akt
substrates glycogen synthase kinase 3h and p70S6K were elevated
by ectopic expression of miR-214 and decreased by knockdown of
miR-214 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that miR-214 targets the PTEN/Akt
pathway.
To further show that PTEN is negatively regulated by miR-214,
we constructed luciferase reporters with wild-type (pGL3-PTEN-3¶-

transfected with 2¶-O-me-anti-miR-214. The cells transfected with
2¶-O-me-scrambled miR were used as control. Following 72 h of
transfection, qRT-PCR analysis showed that level of miR-214 was
significantly decreased in the cells treated with 2¶-O-me-anti-miR214 (Fig. 4A). Further, the cells were treated with cisplatin or
vehicle DMSO. Cell viability analysis revealed that knockdown of
miR-214 alone reduced cell survival f20% in A2780CP cells.
Moreover, blocking miR-214 expression considerably sensitized
A2780CP cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B and C).
Taken collectively, these data indicate that miR-214 could play an
important role in cisplatin resistance.
Akt inhibitor, API-2/triciribine/TCN, or introduction of
PTEN cDNA lacking 3¶-UTR reduces cell survival and CDDP
resistance induced by miR-214. Because ectopic expression of
miR-214 reduces PTEN expression leading to activation of Akt
pathway (Fig. 2B and C) and inhibition of the cisplatin-induced cell
death (Fig. 3C and D), we next reasoned that inhibition of Akt
should override miR-214–induced cell survival and cisplatin
resistance. We have previously identified a specific Akt inhibitor,
API-2/triciribine, which is currently in clinical trial (17). To test this
hypothesis, miR-214–transfected A2780S cells were treated with
API-2/triciribine, in combination with or without cisplatin. The
cells transfected with Topo vector were used as control. As shown
in Fig. 5A, API-2 abrogated miR-214–activated Akt and significantly
inhibited miR-214–induced cell survival and cisplatin resistance.
It has been documented that miRNAs negatively regulate the
expression of their targets primarily through base-pairing interactions
in the mRNA 3¶-UTR, leading to mRNA degradation or translational

primary ovarian tumor specimens. Of the 30 primary ovarian
tumors examined, 13 exhibited down-regulation of PTEN and 17
had overexpression of miR-214 (Table 1). Among 17 tumors with
elevated miR-214, 11 (65%) had decreased PTEN levels (P < 0.0001;
Fig. 2D). These data further support the findings that the PTEN is a
direct target of miR-214.
miR-214 is an antiapoptotic factor that is associated with
cisplatin resistance. Because Akt is a major cell survival pathway
and its activation plays a key role in multiple drug resistance,
including cisplatin (20, 21), we next examined the effects of
miR-214 on cell survival and cisplatin resistance. Figure 3A shows
that expression levels of miR-214 are low in immortalized human
surface epithelial cell lines HIOSE-80 and MCC-3 as well as A2780S
and OV119 cells compared with other ovarian cancer cell lines
examined. Because A2780S and OV119 cells are sensitive to
cisplatin (22), we ectopically expressed miR-214 in these two cell
lines and examined if expression of miR-214 renders the cells
resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death. Following the transfection
of pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo-miR-214 and G418 selection, stable pool
cells were obtained and the expression of miR-214 was confirmed
by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3B). The cells transfected with miR-214 and
pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo vector were treated with cisplatin or
vehicle DMSO. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, the expression of
miR-214 confers the cells resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death,
suggesting that miR-214 is an antiapoptotic factor.
Having shown an elevated level of miR-214 in cisplatin-resistant
A2780CP cells (Fig. 3A), we next examined if knockdown of miR214 is able to override cisplatin resistance. A2780CP cells were

(chemoresistant) ovarian cancer were readmitted at H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center. miRNA LNA in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH)
analysis revealed that miR-214 levels were low or undetectable in
eight primary tumors but elevated in their recurrent lesions (Fig.
5C; data not shown). The remaining tumors expressed high level of
miR-214 in both primary and recurrent tumors. These data further
suggest that miR-214 plays an important role in chemoresistance.

inhibition, which depends on whether it is partially matched or
completely matched with the target genes. Because miR-214 downregulates PTEN through binding to 3¶-UTR of PTEN mRNA (Fig. 2),
ectopic expression of PTEN by transfection of the cDNA that only
contains the coding region of PTEN should escape the regulation
by miR-214 and thus attenuate or decrease miR-214 function. To
this end, pcDNA-PTEN lacking 3¶-UTR was introduced into miR214–transfected A2780S cells and then treated with or without
cisplatin for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, expression of PTEN
decreased Akt activation induced by miR-214 and sensitized the
miR-214-A2780S cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These results
further indicate that the PTEN/Akt pathway is a major target of
miR-214 and largely mediates miR-214 antiapoptotic function.
Although adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin achieves clinical
response in f80% of patients, the tumor recurs in most patients
within 3 years following treatment due to the development of
chemoresistance (23). Having shown that miR-214 is involved in
cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines, we next examined if
miR-214 is involved in cisplatin resistance in patients with ovarian
cancer (e.g., more frequent overexpression in chemoresistant/
recurrent tumors than in sensitive/primary lesions). Among 30

Discussion
Profiles of miRNA have been reported in different types of
human malignancy (3–12). Thus far, there is a miRNA DNA copy
number study of human ovarian cancer in combination with breast
cancer and melanoma using high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization. In this study, a high proportion of
genomic loci containing miRNA genes exhibited DNA copy number
alterations in ovarian and breast cancers and melanoma (5). In
the present report, we performed miRNA expression profiling in
normal HIOSE and epithelial ovarian carcinomas and showed
that up-regulation of miR-214, miR-199a*, and miR-200a and

carcinomas of breast, lung, and colon (24), there are miRNAs
deregulated in specific neoplasms. For example, miR-122a, a liverspecific miRNA, is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma
(25); miR-204 and miR-211 are up-regulated in insulinomas (26).
Accumulated evidence shows that miRNA expression signatures
correlate well with specific clinical cancer characteristics and can
be used to classify normal and cancerous tissues as well as subtype

down-regulation of miR-100 are recurrent events and that alterations of the first three miRNAs seem to be associated with latestage and high-grade ovarian tumors (Table 2). This finding suggests
that deregulation of miR-214, miR-199a*, and miR-200a could
contribute to ovarian tumor progression rather than initiation.
Although members of the let-7 family, miR-21, miR-145, miR-221,
and miR-155, are often deregulated in several cancers, including

A2780S cells were treated with Akt inhibitor API-2/triciribine (10 Amol/L) and/or cisplatin (20 Amol/L). The cells treated with DMSO were used as control. After 24 h of
treatment, cells were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with indicated antibodies (top ) and assayed for caspase-3/7 activity (bottom ). B, top, A2780S cells were
stably transfected with indicated plasmids and assayed for expression of PTEN, phospho-Akt-S473, and total Akt; bottom, after treatment with or without cisplatin
for 24 h, cells were examined for caspase-3/7 activity. C, LNA-ISH. miR-214 was labeled with digoxigenin-ddUTP using the Dig-3¶-End Labeling kit and hybridized to
paraffin sections of normal ovary (middle left ) as well as a patient with primary and recurrent/cisplatin-resistant ovarian serous carcinoma (middle right and right ).
Left and middle, H&E staining. Unlike normal ovarian surface epithelial cells (middle left ) and primary tumor (middle right ), recurrent/cisplatin-resistant tumor (right )

miR-214 is highly expressed in the cisplatin-resistant A2780CP cell
line compared with its corresponding cisplatin-sensitive cell line
A2780S. Knockdown of miR-214 overrides cisplatin resistance in
A2780CP cells, whereas ectopic expression of miR-214 renders
A2780S and OV119 cells resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
It has been well documented that constitutive activation of Akt
contributes to chemoresistance in different types of tumors,
including ovarian carcinoma (20). miR-214 blocks PTEN translation
leading to activation of the Akt pathway (Fig. 2). These indicate
that miR-214 plays an important role in cisplatin resistance by
targeting PTEN/Akt pathway. Although alterations of several
oncogenes (e.g., Ras, Src, and Bcl2) and tumor suppressor genes
(e.g., p53, RB, and p16) are closely associated with chemoresistance,
the involvement of miRNA in this process has not been

of malignancy (27–29). Therefore, miRNA signatures might be more
effective than mRNA signatures in categorizing, detecting, and
predicting the course of human cancers as well as in characterizing
developmental origins of tumors (29). Our study showed different
expression patterns of miRNAs between ovarian cancer and normal
HIOSE cells. Whereas deregulation of let-7, miR-100, miR-214, miR200a, and miR-125 has been detected in other tumors, alterations
of other miRNAs, including miR-424 and miR-494, were to the best
of our knowledge only observed in ovarian cancer. Further
investigation is required for evaluating these miRNAs as specific
markers in ovarian tumors.
Previous studies have shown that miRNA could serve as
‘‘oncogene’’ or ‘‘tumor suppressor gene’’ and regulate different
cellular processes by targeting hundreds of genes. We showed that

cancer. Alteration of miR-214, miR-199a*, and miR-200a seems to
be associated with tumor progression. Further, miR-214 induces
cell survival and cisplatin resistance by targeting the PTEN/Akt
pathway. Therefore, these miRNAs could play an important role in
the pathogenesis of this malignancy and are potential targets for
ovarian cancer intervention. Further investigations are required
for characterization of miRNAs as prognostic and/or diagnostic
markers in ovarian cancers by examining a large series of specimens
as well as their in vivo role in ovarian tumor development by
creating transgenic and/or knockout mice.

documented. Thus, our study provided direct evidence that miRNA
is of critical importance in chemoresistance of human ovarian
cancer.
Mutation of PTEN has been detected only in endometrioid
ovarian cancer (30). However, down-regulation of PTEN protein is
frequently detected in serous and mucinous epithelial ovarian
tumors (31). The mechanism of down-regulation of PTEN was
thought to be promoter hypermethylation. However, the demethylation agent 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine failed to restore PTEN protein
expression, suggesting that PTEN is highly regulated at the
translational level and that methylation of the PTEN gene plays a
subordinate role in ovarian cancer (32). In the present study, we
showed that PTEN is negatively regulated by miR-214 at the protein
level and that down-regulation of PTEN largely correlates with
elevated levels of miR-214 in ovarian cancer (Fig. 2D). Therefore,
these data indicate that miR-214 could be a causal factor of the
down-regulation of PTEN in human ovarian cancer.
In summary, our study suggests that deregulation of miR-214,
miR-199a*, miR-200a, and miR-100 is a frequent event in ovarian
