ABSTRACT
The Keap1/Nrf2 pathway is a master regulator of the cellular redox state through
the induction of several antioxidant defence genes implicated in chemotherapeutic
drugs resistance of tumor cells. An increasing body of evidence supports a key role
for Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in kidney diseases and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but data
concerning the molecular basis and the clinical effect of its deregulation remain
incomplete.
Here we present a molecular profiling of the KEAP1 and NFE2L2 genes in five
different Renal Cell Carcinoma histotypes by analysing 89 tumor/normal paired tissues
(clear cell Renal Carcinoma, ccRCCs; Oncocytomas; Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma
Type 1, PRCC1; Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma Type 2, PRCC2; and Chromophobe Cell
Carcinoma).
A tumor-specific DNA methylation of the KEAP1 gene promoter region was found
as a specific feature of the ccRCC subtype (18/37, 48.6%) and a direct correlation
with mRNA levels was confirmed by in vitro 5-azacytidine treatment. Analysis of an
independent data set of 481 ccRCC and 265 PRCC tumors corroborates our results
and multivariate analysis reveals a significant correlation among ccRCCs epigenetic
KEAP1 silencing and staging, grading and overall survival.
Our molecular results show for the the first time the epigenetic silencing of
KEAP1 promoter as the leading mechanism for modulation of KEAP1 expression in
ccRCCs and corroborate the driver role of Keap1/Nrf2 axis deregulation with potential
new function as independent epigenetic prognostic marker in renal cell carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

beside the presence of genomic alterations [10, 11]. We
have previously reported that epigenetic modification by
promoter methylation is a main mechanism of regulation
of KEAP1 gene expression in Non Small Cell Lung
Cancer, malignant gliomas, breast cancer and that it was
associated with worst progression free survival [12–16].
Since the role of DNA methylation and genes
epigenetically altered in RCC have been an active area
of research over the past decade, the main purpose of
this study is to investigate the contribution of epigenetic
deregulation of the KEAP1 gene in different histotypes of
renal cell carcinomas.
To address this issue, the analyses were stratified
for the main five histological subtypes of renal cancer: 37
ccRCCs, 15 PRCC1s, 13 PRCC2s, 14 Oncocytomas and
13 Chromophobe Renal Cancers.
A clear association of KEAP1 promoter methylation
and the ccRCC histology was found in a training set of
37 cases with an incidence of 49%. A direct effect on
Keap1 mRNA levels was demonstrated by in vitro
experiments on a set of four ccRCC cell lines. The
specific correlation between the KEAP1 methylation
and the Clear Cell histology was also validated by using
two independent datasets of 481 ccRCC and 264 PRCC
affected patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
portal, showing a significant correlation with the ccRCCs’
staging, grading and overall survival.
DNA-based assays are often more robust than
RNA-based assays, and genes inactivated by promoter
hypermethylation may provide a better target for
molecular screening strategies to identify targeted
therapies. Since the histologic appearance is considered
the primary determinant in the classification of Renal
Cancer [17], the discovery of specific variations in
methylation profiles could further help to stratify the clear
cell renal carcinoma subtype from others [3]. Moreover,
our findings of KEAP1 hypermethylation provide the first
indication that this epigenetic mechanism is important also
in the regulation of KEAP1 expression in an aggressive
renal cancer histotype and could represents an additional
and attractive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common
malignant neoplasm arising in the kidney and comprises
an heterogeneous group of tumors. Various histotypes
of RCC have come to be defined on the basis of their
histologic appearance, the presence of distinct driver
mutations, varying clinical course, and different responses
to therapy [1, 2]. On the basis of morphology RCCs are
classified into clear cell carcinomas, papillary tumors,
chromophobic tumors, oncocytomas, and collecting duct
tumors. Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) are the
most common ones, with a frequency of 70–80% of all
renal cancers. At time of diagnosis as many as one-third
of the ccRCC patients may have a metastatic disease and
about half of the patients will have a recurrence.
Papillary RCC, which accounts for 15% of RCCs
encompasses type I papillary RCC (PRCC1) and type
II papillary RCC (PRCC2). Although inhibition of the
specific cellular signaling pathways has led to some
clinical beneﬁts, the effect is marginal and the prognosis
remains poor for patients with advanced disease.
The premise that RCC histotypes might represent
distinct diseases is underscored by multilevel genomicsbased taxonomy studies. Moreover, different DNA
methylation patterns have been characterized both across
and within the histology-based subgroups, revealing
different RCC molecular subtypes, some of these in
association with a more aggressive behaviour [3].
In both clear cell and papillary histotypes the
Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, the KEAP1 (Kelch-like erythroidderived Cap-n-Collar Homology (ECH)-associated
protein-1, NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
2)-like2, and CUL3 (Cullin 3) were recently identified
as probable drivers. This finding was consistent with the
current knowledge that RCC belongs to the type of tumors
in which the Nrf2 pathway was shown to be constitutively
activated mainly by the loss of Keap1 functions that
lead to Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and enhances the
transcription of Phase II enzymes [4]. The induced
activation of metabolizing enzymes confers to neoplastic
cells resistance to radio- and chemotherapies with growth
and survival advantages during their transformation and
progression [5–6]. Moreover, the transcription factor
Nrf2 plays an important role from acute kidney injury
to chronic kidney disease and cancer and transcriptional
activity of Nrf2 has been inversely correlated with FH
enzyme activity, which is loss in PRCC2 [7–8].
Genetic alterations of Keap1/Nrf2 axis were
described with a variable incidence in RCC, more
frequently in PRCC2 [3, 9]. Genetic alterations of the
Keap1/Nrf2 pathway were reported in a very small fraction
of ccRCC patients. However, several studies demonstrated
a general high impact of Nrf2 dysfunction in renal cell
carcinoma, suggesting that the deregulation of the Keap1
may play a role in carcinogenesis process histotypes

RESULTS
Patients and treatment
Patients’ clinico-pathological features of all the
Renal Cell Carcinoma histotypes analyzed into the study
are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the series included
89 patients grouped in: 37 ccRCCs (41.6%), 15 PRCC1s
(16.9%), 13 PRCC2s (11.2), 10 Chromophobe Renal
Cell Carcinomas (14.6%) and 14 Oncocytomas (15.7%),
respectively. The mean patient’s age at the time of
diagnosis was 63.0 ± 13.5 (yy ± SD) with a range from
23 to 86 years. More than half of the patients were men
(68.6%) versus 31.4% of women. All patients underwent

ACTB ratios were 0.0 (0–0) for NR, 0 (0.000–0.329), for
NRDT paired with ccRCC, and 0.611 (0.000–10.210)
for ccRCC tumor tissues, (Figure 1). The discriminatory
power of the KEAP1 QMSP assay was assessed by
estimating the area under the ROC curve using paired
normal renal tissues distant from tumor and ccRCCs. The
AUC value was 0.68, with an optimal cut-off value of 1.56,
a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 87%. In ccRCC
methylation was detected in 18 out of 37 cases (48.6%),
(Supplementary Figure 4). No statistically significant
differences in methylation levels was detected between the
NR and NRDT group. However, statistically significant
differences were found when the NRDT and ccRCC group
were compared (p = 0.0054; Wilcoxon Signed rank Test).
No significant differences were found between NRDT and
the other RCC histotypes.
In order to independently validate the specific
correlation of data obtained to the ccRCC histotype, the
KEAP1 methylation and the functional effect of KEAP1
promoter methylation on its expression was analyzed in two
independent datasets of 481 ccRCC and 265 PRCCs cancer
samples available from The Cancer Genome Atlas portal
(TCGA), (for ccRCC cohort characteristics see additional
Supplementary Table 2). The KEAP1 gene has a 1.2 kb
CpG island ( chr19:10613047-10614280, hg19/GRCh37)
extending from the promoter region to intron 1, that is
recognized by seven probes (denoted as 1 to 7) present on
the Illumina Human-Methylation450 Bead Chip, all near
the transcription start site of the KEAP1 gene (Figure 2A).
A highly significant inverse correlation of aberrant
KEAP1 promoter methylation and KEAP1 mRNA
expression was found in both ccRCC and PRCC samples

Fuhrman grading was attributed only to ccRCC, showing
a heterogeneous spectrum of aggressiveness: 1 case G1
(2.7%), 5 G2 (13.5%), 19 G3 (51.4%) and 12 G4 (32.4%).
Excluding benign lesions as oncocytomas, the lymph
node involvement at the diagnosis was found only in
8 cases (N1 and N2 patients), whereas 67 patients didn’t
show lymphnode metastasis (Nx and N0 cases). During
follow-up, 33 patients (37%) showed a relapse with 7 cases
of local/ renal recurrence (7.8%) and 26 cases (29.2%) of
distant metastasis (target organs: lungs, bone, liver and brain).
The mean and median follow-up time was respectively 31.2
and 24.5 months with a range of 1–108 months.
During follow-up, 9 patients (10.1%) died of RCC,
whereas 80 (89.9%) patients were still alive, with 92.2%
survived at last follow-up. An Overall Survival equal
to 90.6% was observed. Clinical characteristics of our
series are in line with the just published data [18–19]. The
number of cases for each histotype was chosen similar to
perform an effective comparison. The number of ccRCCs
was larger than the others since the inclusion of the two
different metastatic and non-metastatic groups.

The KEAP1 methylation level was firstly evaluated
on DNA obtained from a total of 89 RCC tissues, 70 paired

showing a methylation value > 0,10 (Figure 2B). However,
a methylation value > 0,10 was observed only in 3%
(7 out of 265) of PRCCs, thus confirming results obtained
on our small cohort of an inconsistent contribution of the
KEAP1 promoter epigenetic silencing in this histology,
(Supplementary Figure 5).

Relevant results were summarized in Table 2: CpG
methylation at exon 1 and intron 1 revealed significant
association with Overall Survival (OS), grading, staging
and tumor dimension. No association was found with age
and sex, lymphonodes count and metastasis.

Restoration of KEAP1 expression correlated
with demethylation by 5-aza-dC treatment

Association of KEAP1 methylation with clinical
parameters in ccRCCs

The methylation status of the four ccRCC cell lines
FG-2, FW, 5 and EW was assessed. QMSP analysis showed
a variable methylation level of KEAP1 (Figure 3). To verify
whether the repression of KEAP1 expression was correlated
with CpG methylation in the gene promoter, we examined the
variation of KEAP1 mRNA level in the four cell lines before
and during treatment with 5-aza-dC (Figure 4A, 4C, 4E). By
real-time quantitative PCR analysis a progressive increase
in the KEAP1 transcript abundance was observed after
48 h (p < 0.0001) and was shown to correlate in ccRCC FW,
ccRCC FG-2, ccRCC 5 with a decreased KEAP1 promoter
methylation at 48 h (p < 0.001 respectively), (Figure 4B,
4D, 4F). Keap1 expression did not reveal any significant
variation in the ccRCC EW.

We finally examined the correlation between the
KEAP1 QMSP methylation level and patients’ clinical data.
Specifically, we did not find any significant correlation
between the KEAP1 methylation level and lymph node
status, or grading. Moreover, there was no significant
association between KEAP1 methylation and disease free
survival, local recurrence or overall survival. Taking into
account the few samples available, the same correlation
analysis was then performed on the TCGA ccRCC dataset.
For each CpG site of the KEAP1 promoter gene region,
the samples were stratified according KEAP1 methylation
median level to estimate the association with clinical
parameters as independent prognostic molecular marker.

in the most frequently mutated coding regions of the
KEAP1 and NFE2L2 genes. Specifically, we search for
molecular lesions in the KEAP1 Double Glycin Region
(DGR) domain, which contains binding sites for Nrf2,
Bcl2, Pgam5 and Ikkβ proteins. We also check for somatic
alterations in the Nhe2 domain of the NFE2L2. This analysis
did not reveal any sequence variations that would likely
result in a functional alteration in Keap1 or Nrf2 proteins,
(Supplementary Table 2).

An alternative mechanism to achieve the deregulation
of KEAP1 would be the occurrence of somatic mutations in
our RCC samples. To exclude this possibility we analysed
20 ccRCCs (11 KEAP1 methylated and 9 unmethylated
samples) and 10 PRCC2 tumors for somatic alterations

immunostaining

A semi-quantitative scoring system based on
staining intensity and percentage of positive neoplastic
cells to evaluate Keap1 immunoreactivity was applied.
All the areas of the tissue section were evaluated for
Keap1 protein expression. Cases were scored as positive
if independently evaluated by two pathologists (PG
and PP). Keap1 immunoreactivity was observed in the
cytoplasm of tumor cells. Representative images of

To assess the potential correlation between the Keap1
protein levels in ccRCCs and the epigenetic silencing of
the KEAP1 gene, 15 ccRCC tumor cases showing KEAP1
promoter methylation and 14 tumors without methylation
were analysed by immunohistochemical analysis.

cohorts of 481 ccRCCs and 265 PRCCs. Moreover, we
demonstrated that the methylation of the KEAP1 CpG
island represents a critical mechanism regulating the
transcription levels of the KEAP1 gene by showing a
statistical significant inverse Pearson Correlation between
KEAP1 methylation and transcript levels. Further, these
data are corroborated by the fact that pharmacological
5-Aza treatment is able to restore the expression of Keap1
in 3 out of 4 different ccRCC cell lines.
Methylation levels did not correlate with the
Keap1 protein expression assessed in 29 ccRCC tumors
by IHC analysis. The reasons for this lack of association
might be due to several reasons. First, there is a lack of a
consistently defined cut-off value for the semiquantitative
immunohistochemical scoring and to detection limit [25].
Moreover, ccRCCs are heterogeneous/multifocal tumours
and intra-tumoral heterogeneity could involve epigenetic
changes similar to genetic and genomic events [26–27].
QMSP is a highly sensitive methodology and methylation
signals may be obtained even if cells that carry KEAP1
promoter methylation represent a small proportion
among the majority of cells with unmethylated promoter.
Conversely, IHC may not be able to detect small clusters of
cells that have lost protein expression.”
No genetic abnormalities were identified by
analysing the DNA obtained from a subset of 20 ccRCCs
and 14 PRCC2s. This result is in line with public data
on the somatic mutation frequency of KEAP1 in RCC.
The COSMIC database has KEAP1 sequence data
on 953 cases of ccRCC of which only 8 had a nonsynonymous KEAP1 mutation (0.8%) and 1/875 had a
non-synonymous NFE2L2 mutation (0.1%). Moreover,
in the TCGA analysed dataset, only 2 out of 446 ccRCCs
had a mutations (0.5%). In papillary RCCs, 8 out of 183
non-synonymous NFE2L2 mutations are described (4%),
[28]. This result partially confirms the previous available

DISCUSSION
A growing amount of evidence suggest that an
increased activity of Nrf2 due to NFE2L2 or KEAP1
mutations may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
many solid tumors and recently emerged as one of the main
pathways implicated in Renal Carcinoma [13, 20–22]. Of
note, deregulation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway was highlighted in
the Papillary Type 2 subtype of renal cancer as a consequence
of an abnormal fumarate accumulation in congenital fumarate
hydratase deficiency [13, 20] which predisposes to PRCC2.
Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and CUL3 genes
were also frequently reported in sporadic cases with
PRCC2, but less frequently for the clear-cell subtypes
of RCC. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and CUL3 genes
were also reported more frequently for sporadic cases with
PRCC2 than for the clear-cell subtypes of RCC [21, 23].
This could be explained taking into account the
heterogeneity features of renal cancer and more importantly
by an existing alternative epigenetic mechanism to regulate
Keap1-Nrf2 signalling. KEAP1 promoter epigenetic
silencing as just reported in cancers as well as in the other
diseases with a clear association with tumors having a low
incidence of somatic mutations [22, 24].
Since no data are available regarding the contribution
of KEAP1 hypermethylation in renal cancer, we decided
to investigate this epigenetic mechanism of silencing
by performing a comprehensive genetic and epigenetic
analysis in 89 surgical resected RCCs. As main result, an
aberrant promoter KEAP1 methylation was identified in
the ccRCC subset with a frequency of 49%. The strong
correlations with this specific histotype was then confirmed
by the revision of the TCGA data for two different

published data that reported a low rate of inactivating
mutations of CUL3 or activating mutations of NFE2L2 in
sporadic PRCC2.
Deregulation of the Nrf2/Keap1 system has been
linked to patient’s outcome and to resistance to a variety
of anticancer drugs, due to the key role of Nrf2 in
modulating the expression of phase II drug metabolism
enzymes and phase III drug transporters [17]. In patients
affected by solid tumors, a nuclear Nrf2 accumulation in
combination with a low or absent Keap1 expression was
associated with poor outcome. However, this was not
well investigated in Renal Cancer. In our study follow up
data were available for all 37 ccRCC cases. No evidence
of a statistical significant correlation with the risk to
progress was observed for patients bearing epigenetic
abnormalities. This may be mainly due to the statistical
power of the small sample cohort. Therefore, we extended
our studies by analysing 450K methylation array data for
the CpG promoter of KEAP1 for an independent cohort
of 481 ccRCC patients with available clinic-pathological
data. A clear association was observed between the
hypermethylation of CpGs located in the KEAP1 promoter
and an increased ccRCC tumor grading and staging,
further supporting their biological relevance. Furthermore,
the data analysis suggests that KEAP1 hypermethylation is
able to predict patients’ survival. An increased methylation
level of 5/7 CpGs was strongly associated with worse OS
in ccRCCs.
Our study reports for the first time the
epigenetic modulation of KEAP1 by CpGs promoter
hypermethylation as the leading mechanism of KEAP1
deregulation in ccRCC and together with recently
published data on PRCC2, corroborate the hypothesis
of a driver role of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in the
ccRCCs subtypes with a specific epigenetic deregulation
mechanism. In line with data from previous molecular
studies, this epigenetic finding represents a new disease
molecular marker for a specific subtype of RCC. An
important avenue of future work will be to complement
this epigenetic biomarker to existing renal cancer genetic
biomarkers to assess their importance from the standpoint
of therapy and clarify their potential for application
in the clinical setting. At the same time, based on the
high frequency of tumors displaying aberrant Nrf2
activation, Nrf2 should be regarded as an important new
pharmacological target [29, 30].

DNA was extracted from each cell line by using the
standard procedure with Phenol-Chloroform. RNA
was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies)
in according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA
and RNA concentrations were estimated by NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific).

Patients and tissue samples
The patients’ clinical and pathological data including
pathological TNM staging, site of the lesion, grading, age,
gender, and follow-up data were collected and are shown
in Table 1.
Renal cancer tissues samples were obtained as
Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) specimens from
89 patients surgically treated in the Department of Urology
at the “Regina Elena” National Cancer Institute of Rome.
All tissue specimens showing features of Clear Renal
Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC, n = 37), Type I Papillary Renal
Cell Carcinoma (PRCC1, n = 15), Type II Papillary
Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC2, n = 13), Oncocytoma
(n = 14) and Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma
(n = 13), attending the Outpatient Clinic of the Department
of Urology or undergoing to curative surgical treatment
during the period 2003–2013. Wherever possible, all
available paired histologically confirmed normal renal
tissues distant from tumor (NRDT, n = 70) and normal renal
tissue samples from urothelial tumor patients (NR, n = 10)
were collected. All human materials used in the study were
obtained in compliance with guidelines of the Local Ethical
Committee.
After excision, tissues were collected in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraffin for histopathological
and immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor samples with
at least 70% cancer cells were eligible for direct genetic
and epigenetic analyses. Cases showing tumor cellularity
lower than 70% were microdissected for enrichment of
neoplastic cell content.

DNA extraction
Sections, 3-μm-thick, were cut from FFPE tissue
blocks and subjected to Hematoxilyn and Eosin (H&E)
staining to verify tumor cellularity. Under light microscope,
12-μm-thick sections of tumor specimens were then
carefully dissected to enrich for areas that contained tumor
cells. DNA was subsequently extracted from the paraffinembedded sections as previously described [31]. DNA
concentrations were measured by using Thermo Scientific
NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
ccRCC FG-2, ccRCC FW, ccRCC 5 and ccRCC EW
clear renal cancer cell lines were obtained in collaboration
with the UMCG, Department of Genetics, Groningen,
the Netherland (Dr. Klaas Kok, PhD) and were cultivated
in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS.

In vitro 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)
treatment

Glycine Repeat) domain of the Keap1 protein and exon
2 of the NFE2LE gene, encoding the Nhe2 domain
(Supplementary Table 3). Amplification reactions were
performed by using the Gene Amp PCR System 9700
Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA),
in a final reaction volume of 25 µl containing 100 ng of
genomic DNA template, 0.25 nM dNTPs, 20 pmol of
each primers, 1U HotMaster Taq polymerase (Eppendorf
AG, Hamburg, Germany), in 10X Hot Master Taq Buffer
with magnesium and sterile distilled water. PCR cycling
conditions include an initial denaturation step at 94°C for
2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, annealing
for 30 sec, extension at 72°C for 30 sec and ending with
a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products
were purified using GFX PCR DNA and the Gel Band
Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK)
and sequenced by using the Big Dye Terminator Ready
Reaction mix v. 1.1 on an ABI 3100 sequence detection
system with the Sequencing Analysis software v.3.7
(Applied Biosystems).

FG-2, FW, 5 and EW ccRCC cell lines were seeded
in a 6 well dish. The 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC),
an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, was added in
a concentration of 5 µM (Sigma-Aldrich) with fresh
medium for 24 h and 48 h. At both time points (24 h and
48 h) cells were harvested for DNA and RNA isolation to
interrogate the effects of induced DNA demethylation and
analyse the KEAP1 expression levels.

Quantification of the KEAP1 expression by
real-time PCR
PCR fragments for KEAP1 and RPLPO were
amplified by the Taqman assay listed in Supplementary
Table 1, and were cloned into the StrataCloneTM PCR
Cloning Vector pSC-A (Stratagene, Milan, Italy). Miniprep cultures were grown in 5 ml of LB-Ampicillin broth.
Plasmid DNA from the selected transformed cells was
isolated using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen)
Five plasmid dilutions in the range of 1 × 106 copies to
1 × 102 copies were used to construct the standard curves
for real-time PCR.
First strand cDNA synthesis from 1 µg of total
RNA extracted from renal cell lines was carried out
with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis (Thermo
Fisher, Invitrogen Division, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using
a gene expression amplification mixture containing
2.5 × TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher, Life Technologies division), 250 nM of TaqMan™
Gene Expression Assay with TaqMan probe and 1 μl of
template cDNA or plasmid product (serial dilutions), (Table
1). Reactions were run on ABIPRISM 7900HT Sequence
Detection System (Thermo Fisher, Life Technologies
division). Protocol conditions were as follows: 10 min at
95°C, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s. Each
assay was carried out in triplicate and the transcription
level was normalized using RPLPO as reference gene.
Calibration curves for the KEAP1 and PRLPO genes
(used as calculation method) were constructed and sample
concentration was calculated using the plasmid standard
curve, resulting in plasmid concentrations expressed as
copy number of corresponding standard molecules. The
relative sample amount was expressed as ratio marker
([KEAP1/RPLPO]*1000 for an easier tabulation).

Bisulfite conversion of DNA and quantitative
methylation specific PCR analysis (QMSP)
One microgram of DNA extracted from cell lines and
tissue samples was subjected to bisulfite treatment and DNA
purification using the Epitect Bisulphite kit (Qiagen Sci, MD,
USA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Bisulfitemodified DNA was used as template for Quantitative
Methylation Specific PCR (qMS-PCR) to detect converted
DNA. Primer/probe sets for the KEAP1 promoter region
and for the unmethylated promoter region of the ACTB as
reference gene were previously described and are reported
in Supplementary Table 1 [12]. Calibration curves for both
target and reference genes were constructed using serial
dilutions (90–0.009 ng) of commercially available fully
methylated DNA (CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA,
Millipore, Chemicon, cat#S7821). Amplification reactions
were carried out in triplicate in 384-well plates and in a
volume of 10 mL that contained 50 ng of bisulfite-modified
DNA on a ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence detection system
and were analysed by SDS 2.1.1 software (Thermo Fisher
Inc., Applied Biosystems division). Each plate included
calibration curves for the ACTB and KEAP1 genes, patients’
DNA samples, a positive control CpGenome Universal
Methylated DNA, and multiple water blanks (Supplementary
Figure 1). The Cp (cross point) values of each QMSP
reaction were calculated using the second derivative
maximum method. The qMS-PCR standard curves of
the KEAP1 and ACTB genes for the normalization of the
input DNA were established with CpGenome Universal
Methylated DNA. Methylation levels were finally calculated
as the ratio of KEAP1 to ACTB and then multiplied by 1000
for easier tabulation (average value of triplicates of Target
Gene/average value of triplicates of ACTB× 1000).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded sections (3 µm)
of 29 ccRCCs were selected for IHC analysis and collected
on polarized slides. The sections were deparaffinised in
xylene, hydrated in gradient alcohol, and warmed in TrisEDTA buffer (0.01 M, pH = 9.0) for antigen retrieval at

98°C. The sections were then incubated with hydrogen
peroxide (0.3% v/v) in methanol for 5 min to quench
the endogenous peroxidase activity. Thereafter, the
slides were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Keap1
antibody (AP-20503, Proteintech, Chicago, USA) for
60 min at RT. The primary antibody was detected by using
commercially available detection kit (EnVisionTMFLEX+,
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) following the manufacturer’s
protocol and diaminobenzidine as chromogen.
Slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS,
0.1 M, pH = 7.4), 3–5 times after each step. Finally, the
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin
and mounted with Biomount (BIO-OPTICA, Milan, Italy).
In the negative control tissue sections, the primary antibody
was replaced by isotype specific non-immune rabbit IgG.
Tissue sections from colon cancer were used as a positive
control for Keap1expression.The sections were evaluated
by light microscopic examination on Olympus BX51
microscope.
Each slide was evaluated for Keap1 immunostaining
by using a semi-quantitative scoring system combining
staining intensity and the percentage of positive neoplastic
cells.
Immunoreactivity was assessed in all the areas of the
tissue section. Keap1 protein expression, independently
evaluated by two Pathologists (PG and PP) was scored
as positive if cytoplasm reactivity was observed in
tumor cells. The semi-quantitative scale based on the %
of immunoreactive neoplastic cells was: 0–10% = 0;
10–30% = 1; 30–50% = 2; 50–70% = 3 and 70–100% = 4.
Sections were also scored on the basis of staining intensity
as negative = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; intense =3. Finally,
a immunoreactive staining score (IRS) was obtained by
adding the score of percentage positivity and intensity and
samples were classified ad negative/weak staining (IRS < 2)
and moderated/strong staining (IRS ≥ 2).

range and frequencies and percentages for continuous and
categorical variables, respectively. Baseline comparisons
were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test or Pearson
chi-squared test for continuous and categorical variables,
respectively.
Methylation level comparison between tumors
and paired normal tissues was performed by using the
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. ROC curve analysis was
performed to assess the diagnostic performances of
KEAP1 methylation levels. Sensitivity and specificity
were also reported at the optimal cut-off which maximized
jointly sensitivity and specificity.
Correlation between KEAP1 mRNA expression
(TCGA Illumina HiSeq platform) and the level of KEAP1
methylation was assessed using Spearman correlation
coefficient.
Association between IHC and methylation was
tested using Mc Nemar test.
Proportional hazard Cox regression analysis was
performed to assess the association between KEAP1
methylation and overall survival.
For in vitro experiments, group comparisons were
performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test.
