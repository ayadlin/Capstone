Abstract
Sunlight UV exposure produces DNA photoproducts in skin that are repaired solely by nucleotide excision
repair in humans. A significant fraction of melanomas are thought to result from UV-induced DNA damage
that escapes repair; however, little evidence is available about the functional capacity of normal human melanocytes, malignant melanoma cells, and metastatic melanoma cells to repair UV-induced photoproducts in
DNA. In this study, we measured nucleotide excision repair in both normal melanocytes and a panel of melanoma cell lines. Our results show that in 11 of 12 melanoma cell lines tested, UV photoproduct repair occurred as efficiently as in primary melanocytes. Importantly, repair capacity was not affected by mutation in
the N-RAS or B-RAF oncogenes, nor was a difference observed between a highly metastatic melanoma cell line
(A375SM) or its parental line (A375P). Lastly, we found that although p53 status contributed to photoproduct
removal efficiency, its role did not seem to be mediated by enhanced expression or activity of DNA binding
protein DDB2. We concluded that melanoma cells retain capacity for nucleotide excision repair, the loss of
which probably does not commonly contribute to melanoma progression. Cancer Res; 70(12); 4922–30. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
UV light from the sun causes a variety of lesions in the
genome that distort the structure of DNA, resulting in blocks
to gene transcription and DNA replication. Epidemiologic evidence strongly indicates that UV-induced DNA damage is a
primary cause of skin cancer, including melanoma (1, 2), an
aggressive form of skin cancer that arises from specialized
pigmented cells called melanocytes. Although comprising
only 5% to 10% of human skin, melanocytes synthesize the
pigment melanin, which provides skin tone, hair color, and
protection from UV radiation. The significant increase in
melanoma cases in the past half-century and the poor survival rates among patients with metastatic melanoma (3, 4)
therefore merit thorough investigations of the underlying
causes of melanoma initiation and progression.
Among the lesions induced by UV, cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers (CPD; 80–90%) and [6-4] pyrimidine-pyrimidone
photoproducts ([6-4] PP; 10–20%) are most abundant, alAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1Biochemistry and Biophysics,

though both can be accurately removed from the genome
by nucleotide excision repair (henceforth termed “excision
repair”). This well-characterized repair system responds to
a variety of environmental and chemotherapeutic agents that
form bulky adducts in DNA and, in humans, is the sole mechanism for removal of CPDs and [6-4] PPs from DNA (5). Importantly, reconstitution of excision repair in vitro with the
six essential factors (XPA, RPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPFERCC1) has provided a significant understanding of the individual steps of repair and allowed a clear determination of
the minimal set of factors necessary and sufficient for the
complete removal of UV photoproducts from DNA (6, 7).
The importance of the excision repair system to human
health is most obvious in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a
disease in which most patients lack one of the essential excision repair factors (8). One consequence of this loss is a
2,000-fold higher incidence of metastatic melanoma compared with normal individuals (9).
Melanomas display complex genetic profiles but often
show activating mutations in the oncogenes B-RAF (50–
75%) and N-RAS (10–15%; refs. 10, 11), resulting in enhanced
cell growth through signaling of the mitogenic extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway (12, 13). Similarly, although the tumor suppressor p53 is disrupted in nearly half
of all cancers and is known to promote repair of UV photoproducts in many cell types (14), studies indicate that p53
mutations are rare in primary melanoma (<1%; ref. 15) but
do increase in frequency in metastatic melanoma (5%;
ref. 16). Although the p53 gene is not commonly altered in
melanoma, disruption of the tumor suppressor ARF, which
regulates p53 protein stability, is a common occurrence in
metastatic melanoma through genetic deletion of the

CDKN2A locus (17–19). Therefore, alterations of p53dependent pathways have the potential to influence melanoma progression.
In contrast, although there is some evidence linking a polymorphism in the excision repair gene XPD and susceptibility
to cutaneous melanoma (20), there is little available data indicating that altered expression of excision repair genes
contributes to melanoma, and indeed, a recent microarray
analysis of mRNA expression profiles in metastatic melanomas did not find changes in excision repair genes (21).
Although analyses of mRNA transcript and protein expression profiles have the potential to be informative, it may be
more relevant to test for functional excision repair capacity
to make proper correlations of DNA repair and carcinogenesis. Along these lines, although early work initially indicated
that melanoma cells did not show enhanced repair rates (22),
other work suggested that subclones of a metastatic melanoma line did indeed show elevated repair rates in comparison
with nonmelanoma cells, and this repair correlated with increased survival after UV (23). An additional study similarly
concluded that DNA repair capacity in mouse melanoma cell
lines correlated with metastatic potential (24). However,
more recent in situ work indicated that cutaneous melanoma
patients show normal repair kinetics (25). It is therefore unclear whether excision repair capacity is altered in melanoma
cells relative to normal melanocytes or whether genetic background (B-RAF/N-RAS/p53 status) or metastatic potential is
directly correlated with excision repair capacity.
In this study, we used normal human melanocytes (NHM)
and a variety of melanoma cell lines to characterize excision
repair capacity as a function of genetic and metastatic states.
Our results show that in nearly all melanoma cell lines tested,
excision repair occurred as efficiently as in NHMs, irrespective of mutations in the N-RAS and B-RAF oncogenes. In addition, we found no change in excision repair capacity in a
highly metastatic melanoma cell line (A375SM) compared
with its parental melanoma cell line (A375P), which has a
low metastatic potential. Lastly, we observed that melanoma
cell lines containing functional p53 repair UV photoproducts
more efficiently than lines with inactive p53 but that this difference seems to be not due to enhanced levels of the UV
photoproduct binding protein DDB2.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Description of the sources, culture method, and UV irradiation of the melanoma cell lines is provided in Supplementary Table S1. All of the cell lines used in our study are
authenticated by microarray analysis as described previously
(13). Secondary cultures of NHMs were derived as reported
previously (26). Briefly, these cells (NHM16 and NHM21)
were grown in Medium 254 (Life Technologies) containing
Human Melanocyte Growth Supplement (HMGS-1; Life
Technologies) at 37°C in a cell culture incubator with
5% CO 2 . A375P and A375SM cell lines were a gift from
Dr. Richard O. Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, MA).

UV irradiation
Culture medium was removed from exponentially growing
cells and set aside, and then cells were washed once with
warm PBS before placement under a GE germicidal lamp
emitting primarily 254-nm UV light (UV-C) connected with
a digital timer. After receiving the indicated dose of UV
(typically 5–20 J/m2 , as indicated), culture medium was
added back to the cells, which were subsequently placed
back into the cell culture incubator for the indicated length
of time. A UV-C sensor (UV Products) was used to calibrate
the fluence rate of the incident light.
Immunoslot blot assay for measurement of CPD and
[6-4] PP repair in vivo
Repair of CPDs and [6-4] PPs by immunoslot blot was performed essentially as reported previously (27).
Fluorescence microscopy
Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (28). Briefly, cells were cultured in
35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) for 24 hours before
UV irradiation (10 J/m2). Cells harvested at various time
points after irradiation were fixed with 4% formalin and further treated with ice-cold detergent (0.5% Triton X-100) for
5 minutes. After denaturation of DNA with 2 mol/L HCl for
30 minutes at room temperature, CPDs were detected with
the mouse monoclonal anti-CPD antibody (Kamiya Biomedical) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate
(Invitrogen). Nuclear DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide, and CPD signals were observed with a Leica inverted DMIRB fluorescence microscope.
Measurement of [6-4] PP repair activity in cell-free
extracts
Preparation of radiolabeled substrate and the in vitro excision repair assay was essentially as previously described
(27, 29). Cell-free extracts for use in the excision assay were
prepared as reported (30).
Immunoblot analyses
Protein lysates from exponentially growing cultures of
cells were harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described elsewhere (26). The following antibodies were used to detect the respective proteins: XPA,
XPC, RPA70, TFIIH (p62 subunit, XPB), p53, and actin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); p21, DDB2, and GAPDH (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.); RPA34 (Calbiochem); and XPF and XPG
(Abcam).
siRNA transfection
Exponentially growing cells of SK-Mel-103 or SK-Mel-187
were transfected with either p53 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) transfection reagent.
Cells were UV irradiated 48 hours after transfection and then
harvested at the indicated time points to assay for CPD
repair.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for UV-DDB
binding activity
UV-DDB binding activity was performed using cell-free extracts from both SK-Mel-103 and SK-Mel-187 cell lines as reported previously (30–33). Briefly, 5 fmol of 136-bp dsDNA
containing a [6-4] PP were incubated with the indicated
amount of proteins or cell-free extract in 12.5 μL of reaction
mixtures. After a 30-minute incubation at 30°C, glycerol was
added to ∼8%, and reaction mixtures were resolved using
5% native PAGE at room temperature with a constant current (25 mA). DNA binding was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software
(Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant UV-DDB protein was
used as a positive control for DDB binding activity (31).
Matrigel invasion assay
Cellular invasion assays were performed using 8.0-μm pore
size Biocoat Matrigel Invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) as
described by the manufacturer. Each data point represents
the average of three independent experiments and error bars
represent the SD of the mean.

Results
Measurement of [6-4] PP repair in vitro
Epidemiologic evidence suggests a strong correlation between exposure to UV from the sun and development of melanoma in humans (22, 34, 35), and we therefore sought to
investigate whether the capacity to repair UV photoproducts
differed between NHMs and melanoma cell lines. Our initial
approach used an in vitro, cell-free excision assay to measure
excision repair. Our laboratory has used this assay extensively to study the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair and
to measure repair capacity in mammalian cell lines and tissues (29, 36). The assay involves incubation of an internally
32
P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a site-specific [6-4] PP
in cell-free extract and then electrophoresis of the purified
DNA on a denaturing gel, which allows visualization and
quantitation of the small 24- to 32-nucleotide oligomers that
are generated during the repair reaction (Fig. 1A). Although
the assay has been used with extracts from a variety of mammalian cell types and tissues, it has not previously been applied to measure repair in melanocytes or melanoma cells, a
physiologically relevant and medically important target of
UV-induced DNA damage.
Our initial studies focused on two NHM lines (NHM16 and
NHM21) and two cell lines each from melanoma cells containing normal or mutant forms of the B-RAF and N-RAS oncogenes [wild-type (WT): SK-Mel-187 and RPMI8322; N-RAS:
SK-Mel-103 and VMM39; B-RAF: A2058 and A375]. Using cellfree extracts prepared from the indicated cell lines, we
observed variable amounts of [6-4] PP removal among the
different melanoma lines (Fig. 1B), ranging from ∼1% in
the RPMI8332 line and up to ∼12.5% in A375 cells (Fig. 1C).
This variation is consistent with previous reports showing
that human melanomas show a high degree of interindividual
variability in excision repair in situ (25). Importantly, immunoblot analyses of these extracts showed no clear correlation

dual incisions of the DNA at sites bracketing the lesion, resulting in
release of 24- to 32-nucleotide-long oligomers (excised products) that
are visualized by denaturing PAGE and phosphorimager analysis.

between excision repair capacity and expression level of any
specific excision repair protein (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Interestingly, we observed very little excision activity in the
extracts from the NHMs. To better understand this lack of
excision repair activity with this assay, we supplemented extracts from excision-competent A375 and Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells, which do not contain detectable level of
melanin (Supplementary Table S2), with either NHM16 or
NHM21 extract. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A, both
NHM extracts inhibited the excision activity of A375 and
CHO extracts, indicating the presence of an inhibitory factor

in the NHM extract. We considered that the presence of melanin in the NHM extracts might interfere with the in vitro
excision activity. To test for the effect of melanin, we titrated
CHO cell-free extract with increasing amounts of synthetic
melanin and observed a concentration-dependent inhibition
of excision repair (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This inhibition
was not specific to excision repair, however, as the ability
of restriction enzymes to digest the substrate was also inhibited by melanin (Supplementary Fig. S2C), indicating that
melanin may nonspecifically bind to DNA and inhibit the action of multiple nucleases. We conclude, however, that although the excision assay is a convenient and reliable tool
for measuring repair capacity in many cell lines, including
melanoma cells, it cannot be used for all cell types, such as
melanocytes.
Measurement of [6-4] PP repair in vivo
We next used an immunoslot blot assay to monitor removal of [6-4] PPs in NHMs and melanoma cell lines. This
assay involves the immobilization of genomic DNA from cells
at various times after UV irradiation onto a nitrocellulose
membrane and then immunoblotting with antibodies that
specifically recognize either CPDs or [6-4] PPs (37). As shown

in Fig. 2A, we observed a time-dependent reduction in anti–
[6-4] PP antibody reactivity in genomic DNA from both the
NHMs and the melanoma cell lines, at rates near those previously reported for other cell types (38), with typically 50%
to 80% of [6-4] PPs removed within 2 hours in the various
cell lines (Fig. 2B). Importantly, we observed very similar
[6-4] PP signals in the UV-irradiated melanocytes and melanoma cells before repair, indicating that similar numbers of
photoproducts were induced by UV. Cell lines lacking or containing mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS oncogenes repaired
[6-4] PPs at similar rates, indicating that mutation of these
oncogenes does not significantly affect excision repair. Interestingly, when we compared the relative amount of [6-4] PP
repair in the immunoslot blot assay (Fig. 2A and B) with repair in the in vitro excision assay (Fig. 1) among the six melanoma cell lines tested, we observed a strong correlation
(R2 = 0.91) between the two assays (Fig. 2C), indicating that
the two approaches are reliable measures of [6-4] PP repair
capacity.
Measurement of CPD repair in vivo
We next measured CPD repair in the same set of cell lines.
CPDs constitute the majority of UV photoproducts in DNA

along with the amount of [6-4] PP substrate repaired for 90 min in the excision assay in Fig. 1 (in vitro repair).

and are recognized and repaired by the excision repair
machinery more slowly than for [6-4] PPs and inefficiently
in the in vitro excision assay, making quantitative comparison of CPD repair with the excision assay difficult. Therefore,
we solely relied on the slot blot assay for in vivo repair. As
displayed and quantified in Fig. 3A, with the exception of
RPMI8332 cells, which repaired CPDs very inefficiently, all
the other cell lines removed 40% to 80% of CPDs within
12 hours. Importantly, the two NHM lines showed very similar CPD repair kinetics with three of these melanoma lines,
indicating that melanocytes and melanoma cells repair UV
photoproducts with similar kinetics. The RPMI8332 melanoma line, which repaired [6-4] PPs least efficiently in both the
in vitro excision assay (Fig. 1) and the in vivo slot blot assay
(Fig. 2), seemed to lack any CPD repair capacity, with only
∼4% of CPDs removed within 12 hours (Fig. 3A). To confirm
this inefficient repair phenotype, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to detect CPD formation and removal in
the repair-deficient RPMI8332 line and the repair-proficient
line SK-Mel-187. Very little CPD removal was observed in
RPMI8332 cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B), consistent
with the results of the immunoslot blot assay.
Because we observed a significant difference in CPD repair
in RPMI8332 and SK-Mel-187 cells, both of which are WT for

4926

Cancer Res; 70(12) June 15, 2010

both B-RAF and N-RAS, we decided to measure CPD removal
in six additional melanoma lines with WT forms of these
genes. As shown in Fig. 3C, all six lines displayed CPD removal rates comparable with SK-Mel-187 and the other cell lines
and were unlike that seen in the RPMI8332 cells. Although
the cause of the inefficient CPD and [6-4] PP removal in
RPMI8332 cells is not known, we conclude that the repair
deficiency is not characteristic of melanoma cells that are
WT for both B-Raf and N-Ras. Interestingly, RPMI8332 cells
were also significantly more sensitive to UV than the other cell
lines in a colony formation assay (Supplementary Fig. S3). This
line has high level of chromosomal instability and some unusual growth properties as the cells undergo massive cell
death on reaching confluency, suggesting that inefficient repair is secondary to gross dysregulation of many pathways.
p53 contributes to CPD repair efficiency in
melanoma cells
Although the tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to
contribute to CPD repair rates and UV survival in human
skin fibroblasts and other cell types (14, 38), other work
has indicated no effect of p53 deficiency on UV photoproduct
repair in keratinocytes (39). We therefore sought to examine

p53 functionality in normal melanocytes and melanoma cell
lines to determine whether p53 status may influence CPD repair in melanoma. Because p53 mutation status has only
been characterized in a subset of these lines (13, 40), we tested p53 functionality by immunoblotting extracts from nonirradiated or UV-irradiated cells for UV-induced expression of
p53 and its transactivation targets p21 and DDB2. As shown
in Fig. 4A, p53 functionality varied among the different cell
lines but exhibited normal responses in the normal melanocytes and in four of the melanoma lines (SK-Mel-103, A375,
SK-Mel-5, and Mel-537). With this information, we then
reexamined the CPD repair data for the melanoma cell lines
presented in Fig. 3 by combining the repair data among the
cell lines based on p53 status. Interestingly, we observed significantly more CPD repair in cells with WT, functional p53
compared with cells with mutant or inactive p53 (Fig. 4B). Although less pronounced, [6-4] PP repair also correlated with p53
functionality (Supplementary Fig. S4). To confirm the positive
role for p53 in excision repair, we transfected p53-positive
SK-Mel-103 and p53-inactive SK-Mel-187 cells with either a

nontargeting control siRNA or a siRNA targeting p53 and then
measured CPD repair. Consistent with the pooled cell line
data shown in Fig. 4B, knockdown of p53 in SK-Mel-103
cells, which did not have measurable effect on DDB2 level
(Supplementary Fig. S5), resulted in less CPD removal near
the level observed in p53-inactive SK-Mel-187 cells (Fig. 4C).
Based on these results, we conclude that p53 contributes to
UV photoproduct removal in human melanoma cell lines.
A role for p53 in excision repair has been reported to be due
to transcriptional induction of the XPE gene encoding the
DDB2 protein (41), which in the form of UV-DDB (DDB1DDB2 heterodimer) directly binds to UV photoproducts. We
therefore used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (32, 33) to
examine UV-DDB functionality in SK-Mel-103 and SK-Mel-187
cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 4D, we observed similar levels of
binding to an oligonucleotide containing a [6-4] PP in both extracts, but not in extract from CHO cells, in which the XPE
(DDB2) gene is transcriptionally repressed (14). The levels of
UV-DDB activities in SK-Mel-103 and SK-Mel-187 were similar
6 hours after UV but slightly higher in SK-Mel-103 24 hours after
UV (Supplementary Fig. S6), by which time all of the CPDs were
removed in both cell lines. Thus, we conclude that although p53
contributes to the removal of UV lesions in DNA, UV-DDB does
not seem to be a major contributor through which p53 promotes repair in melanoma cells.
Excision repair in highly metastatic melanoma cells
We next wished to address whether metastatic state in
melanoma contributes to the efficiency of nucleotide excision repair because a previous report indicated that UV
photoproduct removal occurred more rapidly in highly metastatic murine melanoma cells (24). However, because the repair assay used in that study did not directly measure repair
of UV-damaged genomic DNA, we reexamined whether excision repair capacity is altered in melanoma cells of different
metastatic states by comparing [6-4] PP and CPD removal in
A375 cells and a derivative line with a higher metastatic potential (A375SM). As previously reported (42), we confirmed
that A375SM cells are more invasive than its parental A375
line (A375P; Fig. 5A). We then examined the protein expression levels of excision repair factors and found no significant
difference between the two lines (Fig. 5B). Consistent with
the similar expression levels, both A375P and A375SM cells
repaired [6-4] PPs and CPDs at similar rates (Fig. 5C). We
conclude from these results that metastatic state does not
necessarily alter nucleotide excision repair capacity in melanoma cell lines.

Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and in
industrialized countries is rapidly growing in prevalence (43).
Based on the high rates of melanoma in patients with XP,
most of whom lack one of the essential excision repair factors, the development or progression of melanoma may be
associated with a reduced capacity for excision repair. However, here, we show that excision repair capacity in NHMs is

irrespective of B-RAF and N-RAS status, suggesting that altered
repair capacity may not be a predominant cause of melanoma
initiation or progression.
Tumors from metastatic melanoma patients are characterized by significant resistance to DNA-damaging agents, such
as cisplatin, decarbazine, and melphalan (23), suggesting a
broad underlying resistance to the effects of DNA damage.
Although one report indicated that mouse melanoma cells
with high metastatic potential exhibited elevated excision repair capacity (24), the study used an indirect measure of DNA
repair. By monitoring the direct removal of CPDs and [6-4]
PPs from genomic DNA in human A375 cells and a supermetastatic derivative cell line (A375SM), here, we observed no
difference in nucleotide excision repair efficiency (Fig. 5).
We conclude that metastatic potential and excision repair
capacity are not directly related to one another.
In contrast, our results do show that the functionality of
the tumor suppressor p53 is an important determinant of
UV photoproduct repair efficiency in melanoma cells (Fig. 4;
Table 1). These results are consistent with a variety of data
from other cell types, including normal human fibroblasts
(38, 39), although, importantly, our results provide the first
evidence that p53 status affects excision repair specifically
in melanoma cells. Although only 1% of primary melanomas
and 5% of metastatic melanomas show mutations in the p53
gene (15, 16, 44), the common loss of ARF function in metastatic melanomas with deletion of the CDKN2A locus (17–19)
suggests that p53-dependent processes may contribute to
melanoma development. Because p53 regulates many components of the cellular response to DNA damage induced by UV
irradiation, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint, and
apoptosis, it is not clear how its many diverse functions ultimately control cell fate in melanoma. Similarly, although our
data do not indicate that p53 regulation of DDB2 influences
excision repair in melanoma cells, DDB2 may contribute to
other aspects of the UV response in melanocytes or melanoma, such as cell survival and apoptosis (45, 46).

Inefficient UV photoproduct repair has also been shown in
cells with mutations in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R),
which acts upstream in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) signaling pathway of eumelanin biosynthesis (47), and in cells with deletion of the CDKN2A locus
that encodes the tumor suppressor genes p16 and ARF (48).
Although the repair-deficient RPMI8332 cell line shows
reduced expression of MITF and loss of p16, many of the other
melanoma cell lines we examined also show reduced MITF levels (Mel505, SK-Mel-187, and PMWK) or p16 loss (SK-Mel-103;
refs. 13, 26), indicating that other factors are responsible for the
lack of excision repair in RPMI8332 cells.
In summary, 11 of 12 melanoma cell lines displayed normal rates of repair of UV-induced DNA photoproducts in
comparison with normal melanocytes, indicating that functional inactivation of the excision repair pathway is uncommon in sporadic melanoma.
