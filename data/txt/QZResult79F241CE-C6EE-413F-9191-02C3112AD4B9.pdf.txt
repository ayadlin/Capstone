Abstract
Resistance to endocrine therapy occurs in virtually all patients with estrogen receptor a (ERa)-positive
metastatic breast cancer, and is attributed to various mechanisms including loss of ERa expression, altered
activity of coregulators, and cross-talk between the ERa and growth factor signaling pathways. To our knowledge,
acquired mutations of the ERa have not been described as mediating endocrine resistance. Samples of 13 patients
with metastatic breast cancer were analyzed for mutations in cancer-related genes. In ﬁve patients who developed
resistance to hormonal therapy, a mutation of A to G at position 1,613 of ERa, resulting in a substitution of
aspartic acid at position 538 to glycine (D538G), was identiﬁed in liver metastases. Importantly, the mutation was
not detected in the primary tumors obtained prior to endocrine treatment. Structural modeling indicated that
D538G substitution leads to a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain, which mimics the
conformation of activated ligand-bound receptor and alters binding of tamoxifen. Indeed, experiments in breast
cancer cells indicated constitutive, ligand-independent transcriptional activity of the D538G receptor, and
overexpression of it enhanced proliferation and conferred resistance to tamoxifen. These data indicate a novel
mechanism of acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Further studies are needed to assess the frequency
of D538G-ERa among patients with breast cancer and explore ways to inhibit its activity and restore endocrine
sensitivity. Cancer Res; 73(23); 6856–64. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The human estrogen receptor-a (ERa) belongs to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that function as ligandactivated transcription factors (1). Upon binding of estrogen,
the ER dimerizes and binds to coactivators. The complex is
then recruited to the estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) on
the promoters of ER target genes. Approximately 75% of all
breast cancers express ERa, and targeting ERa signaling, either
by reducing levels of the ligand or inhibiting the receptor, is a
key treatment strategy in these tumors. However, some
patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) do not respond
to any form of endocrine treatment (de novo resistance), and
virtually all patients who initially respond eventually develop

endocrine resistance (acquired resistance). Mechanisms associated with the development of acquired resistance include
reduced expression of ERa, altered activity of coregulators,
and increased activity of growth factor signaling pathways (2).
Although mutation of key proteins is a common event in
tumorigenesis, mutation of ERa is a rare event, occurring in
only 1% of primary tumors (3). To our knowledge, acquired
mutations of ERa have not been linked to the development of
endocrine resistance yet.
We report here on a novel mutation of ERa, in which an A to
G substitution at position 1,613 resulted in substitution of
aspartic acid at position 538 to glycine (D538G). The mutation
was identiﬁed in liver metastases obtained from patients who
developed endocrine resistance, but not in samples of primary
tumors obtained prior to commencing endocrine treatment.
Structural modeling indicates that D538G substitution creates
a conformational change that disrupts the interaction between
the receptor and either estrogen or tamoxifen, but mimics the
conformation of the activated receptor. Studies in cell lines
conﬁrmed ligand-independent, constitutive activity of the
mutated receptor. Taken together, these data indicate the
mutation D538G as a novel mechanism conferring acquired
endocrine resistance.

lysate was incubated with 5 mL of anti SRC-1 antibody overnight at 4 C. Then, protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added and,
after a 2-hour incubation, the beads were washed once with IPbuffer and 3 times with PBS. The immunoprecipitated materials were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot
analysis.

Chemicals and antibodies
17b-estradiol (E2) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) were
obtained from Sigma. Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) was obtained
from Tocris Bioscience. The antibodies used include anti-ERa
(F-10) and anti-p-ERa (Tyr 537), both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-SRC-1(MA1-840) from Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc.

Luciferase assays
Cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with the
reporter vector and the various constructs. Luciferase assay
was conducted using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase units were normalized to protein concentration.

Constructs
The ERa expression vector (HEGO) was a generous gift of P.
Chambon (University of Strasbourg, France). The ERE-luciferase reporter construct, kindly provided by D. Harris, (UCLA,
Los Angeles, CA), consists of 2 repeats of the upstream region of
the vitellogenin ERE promoter.
Generation of pcDNA3 ER-WT and 538G-ERa constructs:
full-length ERa was subcloned into EcoRI site of pcDNA3
(Invitrogen) using the primers: 50 -primer: TTGGAATTCATGACCATGACCCTCCACAC, 30 -primer: AAACTCGAGTCAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAA. Generation of 538G-ER: site-directed
mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The ER expression vector was used as a
template for PCR. Primers used were as follows: 50 -primer:
GTGCCCCTCTATGGCCTGCTGCTGGAG, 30 -primer: CTCCAGCAGCAGGCCATAGAGGGGCAC. All subcloned constructs
were sequenced.
Cells and transfections
Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. MCF-7 were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS); MDAMB-231 were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS. All
transfections used Jet Pei (Polyplus Transfection). For all E2, 4HT, and fulvestrant studies, cells were cultured in phenol-free
media using 10% charcoal-treated serum for 2 days before
treatment.
Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested, lysed, and the total protein was
extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L NaF),
together with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails
(Sigma). Lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies
Studies were conducted essentially as described previously
(5). Cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5
mmol/L EDTA). Total protein was extracted, and 1 mg protein

Real-time quantitative PCR
Two days after transfection with the various constructs,
total RNA was prepared using the RNA isolation kit (Sigma).
Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed using RevertAid
(Fermentas). The cDNA was then used for real-time quantitative PCR using StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems). The TGFa–speciﬁc primers used were: 50 CCCGCTGAGTGCAGACC
and 30 ACGTACCCAGAATGGCAGAC. The progesterone receptor (PR)-speciﬁc primers used were: 50 CGCGCTCTACCCTGCACTC and 30 TGAATCCGGCCTCAGGTAGTT. The GREB1aspeciﬁc primers used were: 50 -ACGTGTGGTGACTGGAGTAGC and 30 CCACGCAAGGTAGAAGGTGA. Equal loading
was determined using b-actin–speciﬁc primers.
Proliferation and migration assays
Proliferation was assessed using the MTT assay as previously described (5). For the assay, MCF-7 cells were transfected
with either a control vector, WT-ERa, or 538G-ERa, plated in
96-well plates (3,000 cells/well), cultured in phenol-free media
with 10% charcoal-treated serum for 2 days, and then treated
for 48 hours as indicated.
Migration was assessed using the wound healing ("scratch")
assay as described previously (6). For the assay, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with the indicated constructs and grown to conﬂuency in a six-well plate in phenol-free media with 10%
charcoal-treated serum. The cell monolayer was then scraped
in a straight line with a 200-mL tip and photographed at 48 hours.
Structure modeling
Mutant D538G ERa was modeled twice: (i) according to PDB
2OCF (7) for the estrogen-bound conformation, and (ii) PDB
3ERT (8) for the tamoxifen-bound conformation. Both models
were created using Jacakl as implemented in the Fold and
Function Assignment System (FFAS) server (9), and then
reﬁned using the Relax protocol of Rosetta version 3.4 (10).
On thousand models were generated for each initial model
structure and then clustered using the Rosetta cluster protocol.
A representative of the largest cluster was selected for further
analysis. The wild-type (WT) structure of the estrogen-bound
conformation was also modeled based on PDB 2OCF.
Molecular docking
Molecular docking of estrogen and tamoxifen were performed for both conformations using Dock version 6.5

(11). The results of both tools were similar. In addition,
estrogen and tamoxifen were docked on the WT structures
for method validation. Docking of both ligands was performed
with and without the SRC-1 peptide taken from PDB.

Results
Identiﬁcation of D538G mutation in ERa in breast cancer
samples
From December 2011 to April 2013, tumor samples of 13
Israeli patients with ERa-positive metastatic inﬁltrating
ductal carcinoma (IDC), who have failed multiple lines of
treatment, were submitted for genetic analysis aiming at
identifying novel treatment options. Surprisingly, a novel
mutation (A1613G) leading to the substitution D538G in
ERa was identiﬁed in liver metastases obtained from 5
patients (38%). Importantly, the mutation was not detected
in the primary tumor of these patients, obtained at diagnosis
prior to commencing endocrine treatment. All 5 patients
received at least two lines of endocrine treatment for a
prolonged duration (from 67 to 97 months of treatment) for
the adjuvant and metastatic setting, prior to the development of endocrine resistance (Table 1). The frequency of the
mutated allele was 16% to 41% and correlated with the
percentage of tumor cells in the samples.
All biopsies containing the mutation were obtained from
liver metastases. On the other hand, only one of the eight
samples with WT-ERa was obtained from the liver, and the
other seven were obtained from bone or soft tissues (P ¼ 0.005
for the comparison between the groups). In one patient who
carried the mutation, pulmonary metastasis was analyzed
simultaneously and did not harbor the mutation. This observation may suggest either emergence of this speciﬁc mutation
in the liver or predilection of cells harboring the mutation to
the liver tissue.

Structural modeling of D538G-ERa
Asp-538 is positioned within a critical area of the ligandbinding domain (LBD), termed helix 12, and in vitro substitution of it to alanine or asparagine reduced the activity of the
receptor (12). Aspartic acid contains a fairly large negative sidechain whereas glycine contains only a hydrogen substituent as
its side-chain. Thus, the D538G substitution is expected to
affect the tertiary structure of ERa. Analysis of the crystal
structure of the LBD in the WT-ERa indicates the important
role of helix 12 in mediating the interaction between the
receptor and various coactivators, including the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 and -2 (1). Upon binding of estrogen,
helix 12 is positioned over the ligand-binding pocket, thus
forming a surface for the recruitment of coactivators (Fig. 1A).
However, upon binding of tamoxifen, helix 12 is displaced into
a position that prevents binding of coactivators (Fig. 1B and
1C). The model structure of D538G-ERa (Fig. 1D) suggests that
the conformation of helix 12 in the mutated protein is similar to
that observed in the WT-ERa upon estrogen binding (Fig. 1D).
Thus, the model predicts ligand-independent constitutive
activity of D538G-ERa.
We next compared the effects of D538G substitution to that of
Y537S substitution, which also induces constitutive activity of
the receptor (13). The model demonstrates a change in sidechain rotamers. The hydrogen bonds Y537-N348 and D351-L540
exist in the WT structure, but the Y537-N348 bond cannot exist
in the Y537S mutant (Fig. 1E). Similarly, the D538G substitution
prevents the Y537-N348 hydrogen bond but allows the D351L540 bond to exist (Fig. 1F). These changes in the network of
hydrogen bonds may cause higher ﬂexibility in helix 12, thus
enabling binding of coactivators even in the absence of a ligand.
We next modeled the docking of estrogen and tamoxifen.
The model structure of estrogen- or tamoxifen-bound WT-ERa
(based on 2OCF and 3ERT) yielded a similar pose to the one
observed in the X-ray structure (1ERE, 2OCF, and 3ERT). The

D538G Mutation in ERa Induces Endocrine Resistance in Breast Cancer

model of D538G-ERa suggests a conformational change in the
position of helix 12 that enables binding of coactivators in the
absence of estrogen and interferes with binding of estrogen
and tamoxifen (Fig. 1G and H). Thus, the D538G receptor is
predicted to be resistant to tamoxifen. The molecular docking
used here is based on the assumption that the WT protein is
rigid. Substitution of Asp by Gly at position 538 allows the
protein to be more ﬂexible and may help to understand the low
afﬁnity of D538G-ERa to tamoxifen.
Ligand-independent transcriptional activity of D538GERa
In order to study the activity of the mutated receptor, an
ERa harboring the D538G substitution (538G-ERa) was
generated and its transcriptional activity was studied compared to WT-ERa using the ERE-luciferase reporter (14).
MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with the ERE-luciferase
reporter and either pcDNA3, WT-ERa or 538G-ERa. Cells
were grown in estrogen-depleted medium and treated with
either vehicle control or E2. In the absence of E2, WT-ERa
increased ERE activity by 10-fold compared with pcDNA3transfected cells, whereas 538G-ERa increased ERE activity
by 45-fold (Fig. 2A, black bars, P ¼ 0.002). Treatment with E2
signiﬁcantly increased ERE activity only in pcDNA3- and
WT-ERa–transfected cells but activity remained lower compared with 538G-ERa–transfected cells (Fig 2A, gray bars). In
addition, similar results were noted in the ERa-negative
MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of 538G-ERa increased
ERE activity by 11-fold compared with pcDNA3-transfected
cells (Fig. 2B, P ¼ 0.0002) or WT-ERa–transfected cells (P ¼
0.0004), and treatment with E2 increased activity in WTERa–transfected cells but not in 538G-ERa–transfected
cells. In order to further validate the transcriptional activity
of 538G-ERa, we also examined its ability to induce transcription of the ERa-regulated genes PR, GREB1, and TGF-a
(12). Expression of 538G-ERa in MCF-7 cells increased
mRNA levels of PR by 15.7-fold and of GREB1 by 28-fold
compared with pcDNA3-transfected cells (Fig. 2C and D),
and by 3- and 4-fold, respectively, compared with WT-ERa–
transfected cells (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Similarly,
overexpression of 538G-ERa in MDA-MB-231 cells signiﬁcantly increased TGF-a mRNA levels (Fig. 2E, P ¼ 0.01). Due
to the activation of the endogenous ERa, treatment with E2
increased the transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with 538G-ERa (Fig. 2C and 2D), but not in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 2E).
Taken together, these data clearly indicate ligand-independent, constitutive activity of D538G-ERa in breast cancer
cells.
D538G-ERa interacts with SRC-1 constitutively in a
ligand-independent manner but does not affect
phosphorylation of Tyr 537
Our model predicts that the conformational alteration
induced by the substitution of Asp538 to glycine will confer
the receptor active conformation allowing ligand-independent
interaction with coactivators. In order to test this hypothesis,
we examined the interaction between overexpressed WT-ERa

www.aacrjournals.org

or 538G-ER and endogenous SRC-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 3A). Although WT-ERa interacted with SRC-1 only upon
treatment with E2, 538G-ERa interacted with SRC-1 in a
ligand-independent manner.
Phosphorylation of Tyr-537 may inhibit activity of ERa, and
substitution of it by Asn (Y537N) is associated with increased
activity of the receptor (13, 15). We examined the effect of 538G
on phosphorylation of Tyr-537, using a phospho–Tyr-537directed antibody. No change in phosphorylation pattern was
noted, suggesting that increased activity of D538G is not
mediated by altered phosphorylation of Tyr 537 (Fig. 3B).
D538G-ERa enhances proliferation and migration of
breast cancer cells
We next tested the ability of 538G-ERa to enhance the
proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Cells were transfected with control vector, WT-ERa, or 538G-ERa, grown in estrogen-depleted
medium, and treated with either vehicle or E2 for 48 hours.
Viability was studied by the MTT assay. The 538G-ERa
enhanced proliferation compared with either pcDNA3 or
WT-ERa by 33% in untreated cells and by 28% in E2-treated
cells (Fig. 4A, P < 0.01 for both comparisons).
In order to study the ability of the mutation to affect
migration, we conducted a wound healing ("scratch") assay.
MCF-7 cells were transfected with control vector, WT-ERa, or
538G-ERa, grown in estrogen-depleted medium, and the cell
monolayer was scraped in a straight line and then treated with
either vehicle or E2 for 48 hours. 538G-ERa enhanced migration compared with either pcDNA3 or WT-ERa in both
untreated and treated cells (Fig. 4B).
D538G-ERa is resistant to tamoxifen and fulvestrant
We tested the ability of the active metabolite of tamoxifen,
4-HT, and of the selective ER downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant to inhibit the transcriptional activity of 538G-ERa. To
this aim, we employed the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells,
which do not show intrinsic transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B).
Cells were transfected with either WT-ERa or 538G-ERa,
grown in estrogen-depleted medium and treated with 4-HT
(Fig. 5A) or fulvestrant (Fig. 5B) as indicated. The mutated
receptor demonstrated relative resistance to both 4-HT and
fulvestrant.

Discussion
We show here, for the ﬁrst time, that acquired resistance to
hormonal treatment in metastatic breast cancer may be mediated through an activating mutation of ERa. Despite the
central role of ERa in the development of breast cancer,
mutation of ERa is a rare event (3). Two activating mutations
of the ERa have been described previously, Y537N and
K303R, and both occur in less than 1% of primary tumors
(15–17). To our knowledge, the D538G mutation in ERa has
not been described as yet. Furthermore, no other acquired
mutations of the ERa are currently known. There are two
possible explanations for this. First, prior studies focused
mainly on the presence of mutations in the primary tumor
at diagnosis and, thus, were not able to detect acquired

mutations in the metastases. Second, it is possible that
sequencing methods used previously were less sensitive than
current methods. We noted the presence of this mutation in
5 out of 13 (38%) patients with ERa-positive metastatic
breast cancer. However, these are highly selected, heavily
pretreated patients and may not represent the general

population of patients with breast cancer. The actual prevalence of the D538G mutation needs to be determined in
large cohorts of patients. If indeed the mutation is identiﬁed
in a signiﬁcant proportion of patients, direct testing of it
may be an easy and cheap method to predict response to
hormonal treatment.

(Continued.) The conformation of H12 in the mutated protein is predicted to allow binding of SRC-1 in the absence of E2. D538G mutation alters
hydrogen bonds in helix 12. WT-ERa X-ray structure is shown by beige ribbons and 537S-ERa X-ray structure (E) or 538G-ER (F) in the estrogen-bound
conformation are shown by gray ribbons. Estrogen is shown by yellow sticks. Speciﬁc residues are shown by sticks, with their nitrogen atoms colored
in blue and oxygen atoms in red. S537 (E) and G538 (F) are colored in green. The hydrogen bonds network is shown by dashed black lines. The hydrogen bonds
Y537-N348 and D351-L540 exist in the WT, but both mutants are predicted to lack the Y537-N348 hydrogen bond. In 537S-ER, Ser-537 may bind
D351. In D538G, Tyr-537 is too far from Asp-351 (7.3 Å) but, similarly to the WT-ERa, Asp-351 may bind Leu-540. The D538G mutation alters docking of E2 and
tamoxifen. G, the wild-type X-ray structure of estrogen receptor in the estrogen bound conformation (PDB 1ERE) is shown by beige ribbons and molecular
surface. The estrogen atoms are shown by VdW spheres, carbons in yellow, and oxygen in red. H, the mutant model structure is in gray. The estrogen atoms are
shown by VdW spheres, carbons in yellow, and oxygen in red. The binding site of the mutant is not ﬁtted for estrogen.

Helix 12 in the LBD plays a major regulatory role in
the activity of the ER and is involved in the interaction of the
ER with E2, coregulators and inhibitors (1). Our structure
model suggested a conformational change in helix 12 following
the D538G substitution and predicted the mutated receptor to
be constitutively active ligand-independent and bound to
coactivators. The experimental data strongly support this

model. Although no mutations in helix 12 have been identiﬁed
in clinical samples as yet, ample laboratory data indicate the
role of speciﬁc amino acids within this region. Most amino acid
substitutions either do not change or decrease transcriptional
activity (reviewed in ref. 3). Speciﬁcally, D538A substitution is
associated with decreased activation and increased degradation of the receptor (12), and several substitutions of Tyr-537

alter the afﬁnity of the ER to E2 (13). However, there are several
examples for increased activation and resistance to inhibitors.
For example, certain mutations of Leu-536 increased ligandindependent constitutive activity (13), and substitution of Glu542 to alanine increased E2-dependent activity (12). Thus, the
increased activity of D538G-ERa observed by us is in line with
current knowledge regarding helix 12 structure and function.
D538G-ERa seems to enhance viability and migration of
MCF-7 cells, even compared with E2 stimulation. It remains to
be elucidated whether this phenomenon translates into more

aggressive clinical course upon acquisition of the mutation.
The mechanisms governing this increased activity are not
known. One possibility is altered degradation. Upon E2 binding
and transcriptional activity, the half-life of the ER is shortened
from 5 days to 3 hours, and this may serve as a negative
regulatory mode of the estrogen pathway (18). It is possible
that, as D538G-ERa does not bind to the ligand, its degradation
is altered and its half-life, and therefore activity, is increased.
Although no acquired mutations of ER-a were noted in the
clinic, a series of articles from the laboratory of Craig Jordan
reported and characterized an acquired mutation occurring
in vivo. The mutation, D351Y, was discovered in MCF-7 cells
grown as tumors in athymic mice chronically treated with
tamoxifen (19). This is an important laboratory proof to our
clinical observation. Although D351 does not reside within
helix 12, upon binding of E2, D351 lies next to D538 and plays a
major role in the regulation of E2-dependent and -independent
activation and is also involved in mediating the agonist effects
of tamoxifen (20, 21).
The presence of the mutation may represent the genetic
heterogeneity of the primary tumor followed by Darwinian
selection of resistance clones. This mechanism was noted in
a relatively fast-growing basal-like breast cancer (22). Alternatively, de novo mutations may appear during disease progression.
This was noted in a lobular breast tumor, where 32 mutations
appeared during a period of 9 years (23). Regardless of the
mechanism, our observation clearly indicates that genomic
analyses aimed at predicting response to treatment and identifying novel potential therapeutic targets should be conducted
on the most recent metastatic lesions available. Preferably, both
the metastases and the primary tumor should be evaluated.
The mutation was noted only in liver metastases. In one
patient, the mutation was noted in a liver metastasis and not in
a pulmonary metastasis, and, in the 8 patients without the
mutation, all but one sample were obtained from extrahepatic
sites. This is a very preliminary observation and needs to be
validated in a much larger cohort. However, it may indicate a
special predilection of cancer cells with active estrogen
signaling to the liver. Tropism of breast cancer cells to speciﬁc
organs, especially to the lung, bone, and brain, is a welldescribed phenomenon (24). In accordance with our observation, a recent study noted an association between the expression of hormones receptors and liver metastases (25).
All our patients developed resistance to several forms of
endocrine treatments (Table 1). Ligand-independent activity
explains clinical resistance to treatment with aromatase inhibitors, which inhibit estrogen production. Resistance to
tamoxifen and fulvestrant is predicted to result from a conformational change in helix 12 interfering with their binding to
the receptor (Fig. 1). Studies in cell lines indicated that both
tamoxifen and fulvestrant can inhibit the mutated receptor,
although at high, suprapharmacologic concentrations. Thus,
the concentration of tamoxifen that inhibited the mutated
receptor is 1,400-fold higher than that observed in breast
cancer tissue following administration of standard dose of
20 mg tamoxifen (0.07 nmol/L) and predicts complete clinical
resistance to tamoxifen (26). Similarly, the effective fulvestrant
concentration was higher than the plasma concentration of

fulvestrant (27, 28). The observation that a high concentration
of tamoxifen and fulvestrant can inhibit D538G-ERa is still
encouraging and indicates that other compounds may be able
to bind the receptor, prevent its activation, and restore endocrine sensitivity.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed a novel acquired mutation of
ERa in metastases obtained from patients with metastatic
breast cancer who developed resistance to endocrine treatment. The mutation induces a conformational change, which
mimics the conformation of activated ligand-bound receptor
and confers ligand-independent activity as well as resistance to
endocrine treatment. This discovery may lead to the development of novel endocrine treatments for patients who develop
resistance to currently available endocrine treatments.
