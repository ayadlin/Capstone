Transporter ABCG2 on Clofarabine Cytotoxicity

Abstract
Purine nucleoside antimetabolites, such as clofarabine, are effective antileukemic agents. However, their
effectiveness depends on an initial activation step in which they are monophosphorylated by deoxycytidine
kinase (dCK). Some purine nucleoside antimetabolites and their monophosphate derivatives are exported by the
ABC transporter ABCG2. Because clofarabine is a dCK substrate, and we show substantial variation in dCK and
ABCG2 in myeloid leukemia, we hypothesized that the activity of dCK may modulate ABCG2-mediated
resistance to clofarabine by regulating the formation of clofarabine monophosphate. We show that ABCG2
influence on clofarabine cytotoxicity was markedly influenced by dCK activity. When dCK expression was
reduced by siRNA, clofarabine cytotoxicity was strongly reduced by enhanced ABCG2-mediated efflux. Conversely, dCK overexpression blunted ABCG2-mediated efflux of clofarabine by increasing the formation of
clofarabine nucleotides. The use of an ABCG2 inhibitor confirmed that ABCG2 export of clofarabine is maximal
when dCK levels are minimal. Analysis of intracellular clofarabine metabolites suggested that ABCG2 exported
clofarabine more readily than clofarabine monophosphate. That ABCG2 primarily effluxes clofarabine, but not
chlorfarabine-monophosphate, was confirmed by HPLC analysis of drug exported from ABCG2-overexpressing
cells. Because the level and function of dCK and ABCG2 vary substantially among other types of cancer, these
findings have important implications not only for clofarabine therapy but for purine nucleoside therapy in
general. Therefore, we propose that addition of ABCG2 inhibitors would effectively increase the antitumor
efficacy of purine nucleosides by blocking drug efflux that may be a significant mode of resistance when dCK
levels are low. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1781–91. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Nucleoside antimetabolites are among the most widely
used and effective classes of drugs for viral diseases and
cancers (1, 2). Their cytotoxic effects and therapeutic efficacy
require cellular uptake followed by phosphorylation to their
nucleotide forms (3–5). Recent efforts have led to the development of several improved purine nucleoside analogues that
are adenine derivatives; one such compound, clofarabine (2–
chloro-2-arabino–fluro-2– deoxyadenosine, CAFdA) has broad
cytotoxic activity showing therapeutic promise in xenograft
models against human colon, renal, prostate, and leukemias
(6–10). In humans it is currently approved for use in relapsed
ALL (7). Clofarabine is readily phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and exerts cytotoxicity against both proliferating and nonproliferating cells via multiple mechanisms

(4, 11, 12). Importantly, studies in leukemia cell lines show that
clofarabine resistance is associated with reduced dCK activity
(13), however other mechanisms, such as export of clofarabine
and/or its monophosphate, may also impair response.
Conventional models of resistance to nucleoside derivatives
have emphasized either impaired cellular uptake or reduced
conversion to nucleoside monophosphates (2, 14–16). We and
others (17–20) have shown a new mechanism of resistance to
nucleoside analogues in which the ABC transporters, ABCC4
and ABCC5 (20, 21) export nucleoside monophosphates from
cells. By reducing the concentration of nucleoside monophosphate, this mechanism leads to a reduction in higher phosphorylated nucleosides thereby reducing cytotoxicity. Notably
recent studies have shown that the ABC transporter ABCG2
[which is expressed in many tumor types (22)] exports both
purine nucleoside monophosphates and nucleosides (18, 23).
This suggests an ABC transporter could affect the intracellular
nucleoside monophosphate concentration by reducing both
the amount of nucleoside available for phosphorylation as well
as the amount phosphorylated.
The finding that ABCG2 mediates the efflux of both purine
nucleosides and nucleoside monophosphates (18, 23) and the
fact that some nucleoside analogues are good dCK substrates
(11) suggested that intracellular dCK activity might affect
ABCG2-mediated drug export (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we

found substantial variation in ABCG2 and dCK expression in
myeloid leukemia cell lines (Fig 1B). Therefore we hypothesized that the activity of dCK may modulate ABCG2-mediated
clofarabine resistance by increasing the formation of clofarabine monophosphate. Clofarabine was chosen as a representative nucleoside antimetabolite because it is a good dCK
substrate (11, 24), is not an ABCC4 substrate (Supplementary
Fig. 1), and is effective against multiple tumor types (6–10).
We evaluated the relation between dCK expression and
ABCG2 activity by engineering cell lines to overexpress
ABCG2, wild-type dCK, or both; by "knocking down" endogenous dCK with siRNA; and by developing a new dCK
antibody to confirm dCK protein levels. Taken together,
our results indicate that clofarabine metabolism and cytotoxicity are strongly determined by the interplay between
dCK and ABCG2; they also suggest that inhibition of ABCG2
can improve the tumor cytotoxicity of nucleosides especially
when levels of dCK are low.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The [3H]-clofarabine and clofarabine were obtained from
Moravek Radiochemicals and Biochemicals. The ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC) was kindly provided by Dr. Susan
Bates (National Cancer Institute).
Cell culture
The Saos2 were obtained from ATTC and aliquoted and
frozen at early passage number in all studies. No cell line
authentication is carried out for these cells. The OCI-AML3ABCG2 and OCI-AML3 cells were kindly provided by Dr.
Brian Sorrentino (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,
Memphis TN). The cells were tested and verified by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100
units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine. ABCG2-overexpressing Saos2 cells (Saos2ABCG2) and the empty-vector–control cell line Saos2pcDNA3. One (1) has previously been described (23). The
HL60, M-07e, U937, NB4, KG-1, Kasumi-1, THP-1, MV4–11,
and ML-2 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Sharyn Baker
(St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). No verification of
these cell lines for authentication was carried out as they
were used immediately.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to
ABCG2 (BXP-53, Alexis Biochemicals) and b-actin as previously described (23).
Intracellular accumulation of ABCG2 substrates
Saos2-ABCG2 cells and vector-control cells were seeded at 5
 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. OCI-AML3-ABCG2 cells and
parental OCI-AML3 cells were grown in suspension at
approximately 3.0  105 cells/mL and drug uptake and

Efflux studies in intact cells
Cells containing empty vector, ABCG2 or both ABCG2
and-dCK we plated at a density of 5  105 cells/well on a 35mm dish. Media was changed and cells incubated in warm
ATP-depleting media (DMEM w/o glucose supplemented
with 10 mmol/L Sodium azide and 10 mmol/L 2-deoxyglucose) for 30 minutes. Afterward fresh ATP-depletion
medium was added containing [3H]-clofarabine. Drug efflux
was initiated after extensive washing with ice-cold PBS and
the addition of warm DMEM containing glucose without
FBS, but containing either no or 10 mmol/L FTC. At the end
of the efflux interval, the media was carefully aspirated and
the cells lysed with 500 mL 0.5 mol/L NaOH. The amount of
radioactivity released into the media was determined after
the 1 hour interval to obtain enough radioactive counts for
HPLC analysis.
Cytotoxicity assay
Cells were seeded at 5,000 (Saos2) or 10,000 (OCI-AML3)
cells per well in 96-well plates and cultured at 37 C for 20
hours, then were incubated with drugs for 72 hours. Cell
viability was determined by using the CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation assay (Promega). The concentration
of drug that inhibited cell proliferation by 50% (IC50) was
determined from cell viability data by using the online software Java Applets & Servlets for Biostatistics (programmed by
H. Ono, Nagoya City University, Japan). Each assay included
triplicate samples for each drug concentration, and all experiments were carried out at least 3 times.
Cloning and mutagenesis of human deoxycytidine
kinase
The open reading frame of human dCK was obtained
by using a pair of primers targeted to the 50 - and 30 -ends
[5-GAATTCCAGCAAGATCACAAAGTACTC-3 (EcoRI site is
italicized)] and 5-GCTCGAGACTAAGGAATGGCCACCCCGCCCAAGAGAAGC-3 (XhoI) containing different restriction
sites at the respective ends to permit directional cloning. The
792-bp dCK ORF was amplified by PCR using the human ovary
cDNA library (Clontech) as template and subsequently cloned
into the vector MSCV-IRES-GFP to create MSCV-IRES-GFPhdCK. The dCK structure (25) was used to develop a mutant
dCK with a disrupted P-loop using Quikchange II XL sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies – Stratagene
Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Antideoxycytidine kinase antibody
Human and murine dCK were compared to identify a conserved hydrophilic peptide (Hopp-Woods hydrophilicity) at
the C-terminus of dCK. The human dCK sequence was:
DUNEDFKDKYESLVEKVKEFL (the underlined base differed
in mice). The peptide was KLH-conjugated and injected into
rabbits. The resulting antisera were screened for dCK immunoreactivity against cells engineered to express dCK (see above).
Vesicle transport
We carried out membrane vesicle transport according
to the manufacturer's instructions using commercially

(Ambion). Cells were transfected with dCK siRNA by using
Nucleofector II and Nucleofector Kit T (Amaxa) and treated
according to the Amaxa protocol (solution T). The optimization is shown in the supplemental figure and dCK suppression
evaluated by real-time PCR with a cDNA synthesized by using
a primer set designed to amplify exons 5–7. In each sample,
the copy number of dCK relative to GAPDH expression was
calculated as follows:
2^dCt (dCt ¼ Ct[GAPDH] – Ct[target]).

Results
Possible influence of dCK expression level on ABCG2
modulation of cytotoxicity
Borst et al. recently showed that ABCG2 transports the
purine nucleoside cladribine (structurally similar to clofarabine) and its nucleoside monophosphate (18). Because clofarabine is a good dCK substrate (11, 24), this finding suggested
that intracellular dCK activity (i.e., the extent of clofarabine
monophosphorylation) may modulate the effect of ABCG2 on
clofarabine cytotoxicity (see model, Fig. 1A). Furthermore,
when we analyzed levels of ABCG2 and dCK mRNA in prototypical myeloid leukemia cell lines, ABCG2 mRNA levels
varied more than 100-fold and dCK mRNA levels varied 10-fold
(Fig. 1B). We tested several cell lines THP-1 (0.067 mmol/L) and
KG-1 (0.037 mmol/L) for clofaribine sensitivity and found that
the IC50 values (in parentheses) were higher for THP-1 and
KG-1 than the HL-60 (0.02 mmol/L) consistent with elevated
ABCG2. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activity of dCK
may modulate ABCG2-mediated clofarabine resistance by
increasing the formation of clofarabine monophosphate, a
potentially poor substrate for ABCG2 based on the findings for
cladribine-monophosphate (18).

ABCG2 reduces intracellular accumulation of
clofarabine
We incubated cells with 10 mmol/L clofarabine, a concentration that is very close to that found in patients undergoing
chemotherapy (6, 7, 26). ABCG2 reduced the intracellular
accumulation of [3H]-clofarabine in Saos2 cells (Fig. 1C, left
panel). Moreover, the ABCG2-expressing cells reached a
steady-state concentration of intracellular clofarabine after
approximately 60 minutes, a finding suggesting further metabolism has been reduced, whereas the empty-vector cells
continued accumulating clofarabine. We then incubated cells
expressing ABCG2 at various levels (see insert) with [3H]clofarabine for 60 minutes. The intracellular concentration of
clofarabine was inversely proportional to the quantity of
ABCG2 shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C, right panel).
ABCG2 expression and transport activity in Saos2 and
OCI-AML3 cells
We compared ABCG2 expression and function in Saos2
cells and the human myeloid leukemia cell line OCI-AML3 to
determine whether these parameters are affected by cell
context. RT-PCR have shown slightly higher levels of endogenous ABCG2 mRNA in Saos2 cells than in OCI-AML3 cells.
However, the total ABCG2 mRNA levels (endogenous and
exogenous) were comparable in Saos2 and OCI-AML3 cellsoverexpressing ABCG2 (Fig. 1D, left panel). Analysis of ABCG2
protein expression, by immunoblot and densitometry, showed
a slightly (30%) lower level of ABCG2 in OCI-AML3-ABCG2
cells than in Saos2-ABCG2 cells (Fig. 1D, right panel).
We next compared the functional activity of ABCG2 in
Soas2 and OCI-AML3 cells by using 2 well-known substrates
(mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342; ref. 22; Fig. 2A). Notably,
regardless of the substrate, over 96% of the ABCG2 cells have
strongly reduced fluorescent intensity indicating strong
ABCG2-dependent export activity. To assess transport of
the fluorescent substrates, we compared the ratio of the mean
fluorescence of vector-control and ABCG2-expressing Saos2
cells and of parental and ABCG2-expressing OCI-AML3 cells.
With Hoechst 33342, the ratio was somewhat greater in Saos2
cells than in OCI-AML3 cells, indicating a tendency toward
greater substrate efflux; with mitoxantrone, the ratio was
greater in OCI-AML3 cells. Taken together, these results
indicate that ABCG2 expression and transport activity are
comparable in Saos2 and OCI-AML3 cells.
Impact of ABCG2 on clofarabine accumulation and
cytotoxicity in Saos2 and OCI-AML3 cells
In Saos2 cells, overexpression of ABCG2 produced strong
clofarabine resistance (>8-fold increase) that was readily
overcome by the specific ABCG2 inhibitor, Fumitremorgin
C (FTC) (22) treatment, showing that the effect had been
caused mainly by ABCG2 (Fig 2C, left panel). In contrast,
ABCG2 overexpression in OCI-AML3 cells induced only a
modest increase in resistance (<2-fold; Fig 2B, right panel),
which was almost completely reversed by FTC. This differential effect was unexpected, because OCI-AML3 and Saos-2
cells expressing ABCG2 showed similar ABCG2 functional
activity (comparable OCI-AML and Saos-2 cells have

reduction of mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342; Fig. 2A). To
determine if the differences in clofarabine cytotoxicity were
attributed to intrinsic differences in the cells, we examined
their sensitivity to mitoxantrone (Fig. 2C). The Saos2 cells
require slightly higher concentrations of mitoxantrone to
produce cytotoxicity, however the ratios of the IC50 for the
ABCG2-expressing cells to their control counterparts are
almost identical between Saos2 and OCI-AML3. The similar
IC50 ratios and the nearly identical Hoechst and mitoxantrone
efflux support the idea that ABCG2 is functionally equivalent
in Saos2 and OCI-AML3 cells. However, the reduced impact of
ABCG2 upon clofarabine cytotoxicity in OCI-AML3 cells
suggests a factor independent of ABCG2 accounts for this
difference.
Clofarabine accumulation was next compared in Saos2 and
OCI-AML3 cells that did and did not carry an ABCG2 expression vector. The ratio of intracellular clofarabine content in
the vector-control or parental cells to that in the ABCG2overexpressing cells was greater at 2.0 for Saos2 cells and 1.6
for OCI-AML3 cells (Fig. 2D). Abrogation of ABCG2 actively
with FTC eliminated this difference in both cell types. Therefore, ABCG2 reduces clofarabine accumulation in Saos2 and
OCI-AML3 cells, but unexpectedly seems more functionally
active in Saos2 cells.
The amount of dCK might impact the cytotoxicity of
clofarabine by affecting clofarabine nucleotide formation.
We developed an antibody to dCK (see "Materials with Methods") and evaluated the level of immunoactive dCK in cytosol
from Saos2 and OCI-AML3 cells (Fig. 2E). The constituitive
level of dCK in Saos2 is very low relative to OCI-AML3, and
may account for the intrinsic sensitivity of the OCI-AML3 cells
to clofarabine compared with the resistance of the Saos2 cells.

have shown nearly equivalent amounts of mutant or wild-type
dCK (Fig. 3B, left panel). To determine dCK function, these cells

cells convert a small proportion of clofarabine to phosphorylated metabolites. In contrast, the ratio of phosphorylated
clofarabine metabolites to unchanged clofarabine was
substantially greater in the Saos2 cells-overexpressing wildtype dCK (0.8) than in cells containing the mutant dCK (0.15), a
finding showing high activity of dCK. The intracellular metabolism of chlofarabine in the mutant dCK cells and the parental
cells was virtually indistinguishable (Fig 3B, right panel),
suggesting the mutant dCK is nonfunctional. To further confirm this and rule out possible dominant negative effects of the
mutant dCK upon endogenous dCK, we evaluated clofarabine

sensitivity in the parental Saos2 and Saos2 cells expressing
either mutant dCK, or wild-type dCK (Fig 3C). By using higher
concentrations and a shorter duration exposure, we found that
dCK overexpression strongly sensitized cells to clofarabine,
and reduced the IC50 from approximately 0.2 mmol/L to 0.006, a
30-fold reduction. Notably, the cells expressing mutant dCK did
not have a significant change in the IC50 compared with
parental Saos2. These studies indicate disruption of the P-loop
in dCK produces a nonfunctional dCK that does not alter
chlorfarabine metabolism to nucleotides or sensitivity to chlofarabine. Moreover, increasing the level of dCK markedly
increases sensitivity of cells to clofarabine.
The interrelated effect of ABCG2 and dCK levels on
clofarabine cytotoxicity and metabolism
We retrovirally transduced vector-control and ABCG2-overexpressing Saos2 cells with viral supernatants containing
retroviruses expressing either wild-type or mutant dCK, (cell
populations with equal GFP fluorescence, were selected by
fluorescence activated cell sorting) and dCK expression was
determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A). We then analyzed the cytotoxicity of clofarabine to individually transduced
cell pools with similar levels of dCK (Fig. 4B). The clofarabine
IC50 was 12 times as high in ABCG2-overexpressing cells
harboring a nonfunctional mutant dCK as in cells with mutant
dCK but lacking ABCG2 (Fig. 4B, left panel). The specific
ABCG2 inhibitor FTC almost completely reversed this clofarabine resistance, confirming that ABCG2 caused the clofarabine resistance in these cells. It is notable that at the low
concentrations of clofarabine used to measure cytotoxicity,
the difference in IC50 for clofarabine is less than 2-fold for cells
expressing mutant or wild-type dCK. However, when ABCG2 is
present, the impact of dCK is clear: higher levels of dCK reduce
ABCG2 ability to confer clofarabine resistance. Because
ABCG2 exports the structurally related purine, cladribine
and cladribine monophosphate, we assessed the intracellular
metabolism of clofarabine, but used a higher concentration of
clofarabine to determine if differences in metabolism
occurred in the absence and presence of ABCG2 and functional dCK. Formation of clofarabine monophosphate, diphosphate, and triphosphate are often determinants of nucleoside
cytotoxicity. ABCG2-overexpressing cells expressing mutant
dCK showed the expected reduction in clofarabine level but
also a substantial reduction (4-fold) in clofarabine monophosphate (Fig. 4C). This finding suggests ABCG2 either mediates
the reduction in the pool of intracellular clofarabine available
for monophosphorylation or that ABCG2 exports clofarabine
monophosphate.
ABCG2 exports clofarabine more readily than
clofarabine monophosphate
To determine if clofarabine and/or clofarabine monophosphate was effluxed from ABCG2- overexpressing cells in a
transporter dependent fashion we evaluated clofarabine efflux
after loading cells with 10 mmol/L (3H)–clofarabine under
ATP-depleting conditions (see "Materials and Methods"). After
a 1-hour incubation cells were extensively washed to remove
extracellular drug and resuspended into warmed media con-

taining either the ABCG2 inhibitor, FTC, or its solvent. This
analysis reveals that ABCG2 increases the efflux of clofarabine
derived radioactivity by over 2.2-fold over Saos2 cells harboring the empty vector. Moreover, FTC strongly reduced efflux in
the ABCG2-overexpressing cells (> 35%), while producing a
minimal effect on the vector cells (<3%). Unlike our drug
uptake assays, FTC seems less capable of inhibiting chlofarabine efflux. It is likely the inhibition by FTC under these
conditions may be suboptimal, because the drug efflux is
initiated concurrent with FTC addition, a circumstance that
may allow drug efflux before FTC achieves full inhibition. It is
notable that the proportion of clofarabine-derived radioactivity is not enhanced in ABCG2 cells expressing dCK. We next
carried out HPLC analysis on the effluxed radioactivity to
determine what forms of clofarabine were effluxed (Supplementary Fig. 3; Fig 4D). We found unexpectedly for ABCG2
cells and ABCG2 cells-overexpressing dCK that clofarabine
was exclusively effluxed, however in 2 of our 12 HPLC runs we
did detect some clofarabine monophosphate, but because it
was only a few percent of the total radioactivity we attribute
this to some lysed cells producing clofarabine monophosphate
contamination. To confirm that there were not additional
clofarabine metabolites we carried out a "radioactive-balance"
analysis of the total amount of radioactivity injected into the
HPLC versus the amount recovered in the eluate. This analysis
confirmed that only chlorfarabine was effluxed. These studies
indicate that in intact cells clofarabine is the primary substrate for ABCG2 in cells. To confirm that clofarabine directly
interacts with ABCG2, we carried out studies with sf9 membrane vesicles programmed to express either ABCG2 or the
empty vector (Fig 4E). We evaluated the impact of chlorfarabine on the transport of methotrexate, a well-known ABCG2
substrate. We carried out these indirect studies because, like
cladribine, clofarabine can either rapidly leak out of vesicles or
be transported by equilabrative transporters. We estimated
the IC50 for clofarabine at approximately 14 mmol/L (Fig 4E,
right panel). These findings together with our whole-cell
export studies indicate clofarabine is a good ABCG2 substrate.
Effect of dCK and ABCG2 function on intracellular
clofarabine metabolism
We developed siRNA conditions to knock down dCK mRNA,
which was suppressed by more than 80% in parental OCI-AML3
and OCI-AML3-ABCG2 cells 48 hours after transient introduction of the siRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2). Although dCK mRNA
was not completely reduced by the siRNA, the dCK protein was
undetectable by immunoblot analysis at 72 hours suggesting
dCK mRNA and protein are not coregulated (Fig. 5A).
To understand how the intracellular metabolism of clofarabine is affected by ABCG2 after a reduction of endogenous
dCK, we determined the intracellular clofarabine metabolites
in the presence and absence of FTC in OCI-AML3 cellsexpressing dCK at normal levels or attenuated by a dCK
siRNA. In cells with normal dCK expression, more than
80% of intracellular clofarabine was in the monophosphate
form (Fig. 5B, left panel). Notably, ABCG2 overexpression
seemed to substantially reduce the concentration of clofarabine monophosphate, but produced only a minimal affect on

the concentration of clofarabine, suggesting that with these
levels of dCK clofarabine is rapidly phosphorylated
after uptake and unavailable for interaction with ABCG2. In
contrast, ABCG2 reduced intracellular clofarabine levels by a
factor of 3 in cells deficient in dCK by siRNA (Fig 5B, right
panel); this reduction was not observed when the ABCG2
inhibitor FTC was added. These results show that when dCK is
at low level, ABCG2 reduces the concentration of clofarabine
leading to strongly reduced amounts of clofarabine available
to form clofarabine metabolites.

Discussion
The formation of phosphorylated metabolites is an essential
determinant of purine nucleoside cytotoxicity (4, 10, 12). We
have shown a new interactive mechanism in which ABCG2
efflux of clofarabine reduces the quantity of clofarabine available for phosphorylation by dCK, thereby reducing cytotoxicity. Because clofarabine is effective against multiple tumor
types (colon, renal, prostate) in model systems and therapy for
AML and ALL (6–10), we investigated the interplay between
ABCG2 and the amount of dCK in both Saos2 osteosarcoma
cells (because they have inherently low dCK (this paper) and
the myeloid leukemia, OCI-AML3 cells containing high endogenous dCK levels (this paper). In Saos2 cells, ABCG2
restricted the formation of phosphorylated clofarabine metabolites because ABCG2 reduced the amount of intracellular
clofarabine available for phosphorylation. The results of our
dCK siRNA knockdown studies in OCI-AML3 (which have high

www.aacrjournals.org

endogenous dCK) were also consistent with this mechanism:
in the absence of detectable dCK protein, ABCG2 strongly
reduced intracellular clofarabine even at very low intracellular
concentrations suggesting clofarabine is a very good substrate
for ABCG2. In this dynamic system, the ABCG2-mediated
reduction in clofarabine produced a proportionate reduction
in clofarabine monophosphate. The role of ABCG2 was confirmed by using an ABCG2 inhibitor (FTC), which restored
both clofarabine and clofarabine monophosphate concentrations. Moreover, our membrane vesicle transport findings
show that ABCG2 strongly interacts with clofarabine, we
speculate that this interaction has the potential to override
nucleoside uptake processes when dCK levels are low leading
to reduced nucleotide formation (Fig 1A). Thus, because
reduced dCK is a well-known mechanism of resistance (14–
16) it is conceivable that ABCG2 expression is an additional
factor producing clofarabine resistance.
Although our studies depict a close relationship between
dCK and ABCG2, the exact kinetic relationship between
clofarabine efflux by ABCG2 and clofarabine phosphorylation
by dCK remains to be elucidated. The clofarabine efflux step
can be explored by in vitro transport studies. A recent study
using membrane vesicles to study the kinetics of ABCG2mediated transport of cladribine, a structurally similar purine
antimetabolite, was impeded by rapid leakage of cladribine
from the vesicles (18). These authors used an indirect
approach to show that cladribine inhibits the transport of a
known ABCG2 substrate, suggesting that cladribine is an
ABCG2 substrate (18). We also used this indirect approach

to show potent inhibition of methotrexate transport by clofarabine (IC50 14 mmol/L). These findings in combination
with our intracellular analysis provided a "snapshot" of how
ABCG2 impacts intracellular clofarabine metabolism. Moreover, when coupled with the use of an ABCG2 inhibitor, our
efflux data indicate that inhibition of ABCG2 primarily
increases the intracellular concentration of clofarabine.
Furthermore, our efflux studies show that clofarabine-monosphosphate is not exported in cells that have both high levels
of dCK and ABCG2. In total, these findings suggest that
ABCG2 has a much greater affinity for clofarabine than for
clofarabine monophosphate. One implication is that tumors
with high levels of ABCG2 and low dCK will be insensitive to
clofarabine, whereas those that have high levels of dCK despite
ABCG2 will be sensitive to clofarabine.
The extent to which ABCG2 confers resistance to clofarabine seems to be strongly influenced by dCK activity. Our
findings indicate that, by enhancing clofarabine monophosphate formation, dCK minimizes the extent to which ABCG2
confers resistance. Such a mechanism would be consistent
with our findings. Our studies show that even when
clofarabine-monophosphate (typically the main intracellular
metabolite of clofarabine), reaches high intracellular concentrations (e.g., cells with high dCK), it is refractory to ABCG2mediated export. Early studies have shown that clofarabine
monophosphate is the major intracellular clofarabine metabolite in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (10–12).
This finding suggests that downstream phosphorylation steps

are slow in tumor cells and/or that clofarabine monophosphate is a poor substrate for the next downstream step, i.e.,
nucleoside diphosphate kinase-mediated phosphorylation.
Therefore, we propose that the addition of ABCG2 inhibitors
[e.g., FTC, KO143, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib (27)] might increase the efficacy of clofarabine in
ABCG2-expressing tumor cells by reducing efflux of clofarabine to further enhance the formation clofarabine nucleotides.
