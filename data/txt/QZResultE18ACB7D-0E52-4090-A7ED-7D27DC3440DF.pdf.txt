Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are usually tolerant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
and associated with tumor relapse. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), is currently being used in clinical trials of lung cancer.
However, SAHA facilitates the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells from
somatic cells. We hypothesized that SAHA would mediate the CSCs properties and
subsequently confer a more malignant phenotype in lung cancer. Transfected H1299
lung cancer cells, which stably expresses a triple fused reporter gene (DsRedm-FluctTKsr39) under the control of CMV promoter was used to establish a xenograft mouse
model. After the treatment of SAHA, H1299 cell line and tumor xenografts were sorted
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity. We found that SAHA could suppress the growth of xenografted H1299
tumors with decreased proportion of ALDHbr lung cancer cells indicating that SAHA
may target CSCs. However, SAHA significantly enhanced the tumor initiating capacity
and the expression of malignant genes such as KCNMA1, MORF4L2 and ASPM in the
remaining living ALDHbr cells. These findings suggested that SAHA treatment created
a more drug-resistant state in residual ALDHbr cells. The in vivo imaging technique
may facilitate searching and characterization of CSCs.

This subpopulation of cancer cells has ability to escape

eliminate CSCs. However, a long-standing problem is the

paucity of specific markers to identify and isolate CSCs
from common tumor cells and to investigate their roles in
tumorigenesis. Previous data showed that tumorspheres,
CSCs-like clusters, can be generated in vitro by nonadherent suspension culture in serum-free medium, and
they have been widely used to study underlying key
molecular pathways [3]. Mounting evidences suggest
that the tumor microenvironment is responsible for
conditioning the stem cell status itself. The in vitro system
has been questioned because of the entire differences
between in vitro and in vivo systems in microenvironment.
Side population (SP) technique and flow cytometry using
cell surface markers have been applied to isolate CSC,
but the specificity of these two methods is under debate.
Previous studies reported that non-SP cells and CD133─
cells can also generate tumors in NOD/SCID mice [4, 5].
Regarding the limitations in the isolation
procedures, especially those used stem cell surface
markers, would result in CSC “injury”, we designed an
in vivo method using intracellular markers of stem cells
which were identified in various human cancers to isolate
CSCs from xenograft tumors in animal model. Aldehyde
dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are detoxifying enzymes within
a superfamily. In fact, the expression level of ALDH in
stem cells usually high enough to protect them against
oxidative insult, suggesting their well-known longevity.
ALDH converts retinol to retinoic acid, a modulator of
cell and stem cell proliferation. Elevation of the level of
ALDH activity has been seen in stem cell populations
of breast cancer [6], lung cancer [7], liver cancer [8]
and colon cancer [9]. An ALDEFLUOR kit (Stem Cell
Technologies) designed for precise identification and
isolation of ALDH-bright CSCs using specific inhibitor
for ALDH activity─ diethylaminobenzaldefyde (DEAB)
was thus applied in this study.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) can
induce hyperacetylation of specific proteins, recently
considered as a new solution to inhibit cell proliferation
and promote differentiation of various hematologic and
solid tumors [10, 11]. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA, Vorinostat), an HDACI, was approved by FDA
for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 2004 [12].
Recent investigations demonstrated that SAHA treatment
can suppress the expression of the stem cell marker
CD133 in glioma [13]. In addition, SAHA can also inhibit
the ability to proliferation, self-renewal, migration, and
invasion in human pancreatic CSCs by up-regulation of
miR-34a [14]. These results implied that SAHA could be
a potential agent for the therapy against CSCs. However,
some studies revealed that SAHA leads to the increase
of the stem cell markers in epithelial–mesenchymal
transitions (EMT) phenotypic prostate cancer cells [15,
16]. These findings are in consistent with the clinical
results of HDACIs, which have shown promise efficacy
in hematological malignancies while disappointed effects
in epithelial cell-derived cancers. The detailed mechanism
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated.
In the current study, we aim to determine the
significance role of SAHA in the mediation of CSCs in
lung cancer. The ALDEFLUOR assay and FACS analysis
were used to isolate CSCs from human lung carcinoma
grown as xenografts on nude mice. The results showed
that SAHA retards the growth of H1299 xenografts and
decreases CSC population, but induces EMT phenotype
and activates pluripotency associated program in the
residual CSCs. Our results provide a possible mechanism
for the limited treatment response of HDACIs in the
clinical trials on the epithelial cell-derived cancer.

To investigate the effects of SAHA on cell
morphology, we treated H1299 cells with SAHA, and
found that H1299 cells treated with SAHA caused
elongation and dissemination of fibroblastoid morphology
in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, H1299 cells
treated with DMSO displayed a cobblestone appearance,
a typical morphology of epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). These
results suggest that treatment of lung cancer cell with
SAHA leads to the induction of EMT phenotype. Previous
studies have shown that HDACIs could induce EMT in
tumor cells [15, 16], and the cells with EMT phenotype
have been demonstrated to be the source of cancer stemlike cells [17-19]. To address this issue, we assessed the
expression of genes associated with metastatic ability
and stem cell function such as KCNMA1 and ASPM,
which has been reported earlier to serve as prognostic
molecular markers of the metastatic process and cancer
stem cell maintenance, respectively[20, 21]. The results
from quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
showed that the treatment with SAHA led to increased
expression of genes involving in stemness (ASPM, stem
cell programs), metastasis (KCNMA1, RASSF8), and drug
resistance (MORF4L2) (Fig.1B). We further investigated
the effect of SAHA on CSC populations by using qRTPCR and found that all the analyzed genes was strongly
up-regulated by at least 10-fold in SAHA-treated ALDHbr
cells when compared with untreated cells (Fig.1C).
The capacity of self-renewal is one of the features
of CSCs. To further verify the impact of SAHA on cancer
stem cell properties, we performed the sphere formation
assay as previous described [6]. The result showed that
cells treated with SAHA formed more spheres than
untreated cells did (Fig.1D). We next examined if SAHA
could enhance the expression of stem cell-associated genes
in tumorspheres. As shown in Fig.1E, the levels of all gene
sets were increased in sphere cells when compared with
8664

the controls. As expected, these genes were significantly
enriched in sphere cells after SAHA application. Overall,
these findings confirm that treatment of lung cancer
cells with SAHA leads to the enhancement of CSC
characteristics, which correlates with EMT phenotype.

administration of SAHA with the dosage of 100 mg/kg/day
caused significant suppression of the growth of established
H1299 tumors; reduction of 63% tumor volume compared
with that of the vehicle-treated control animals (Fig. 2B).
Each animal receiving 100 mg/kg/day SAHA survived
for at least 10 days. These results indicate that SAHA
effectively reduces the tumor growth of H1299 xenografts
in vivo at the dose of 100 mg/kg/day.

Expression of cancer stem cell markers and EMT

To monitor the tumor growth and trace the tumor
cells in vivo, we labelled H1299 cells with a luciferase
reporter system. The activity of SAHA against the
growth of lung cancer cells in vivo was examined in
the H1299 human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft,
which was inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice.
The tumor progression rate was assessed by in vivo
luciferase bioluminescent imaging. In the treatment
group, the signals in the tumor are significant lower than
that in vehicle-treated control tumor (Fig. 2A). Daily

ALDH activity has been applied for identifying
CSCs in a variety of tumor types [6, 7, 9]. We used the

each experiment, the samples were stained simultaneously
with Aldefluor and DEAB for identifying the ALDHbr
population. A subpopulation of ALDHbr cells was

detected by flow cytometry (1.62% ±0.02% of the total
cell population) and was also observed by fluorescent
microscopy (Fig. 3B).
CD133 and ALDH have been applied to define
CSCs in multiple epithelial cancer [8] including lung
cancer [22]. We examined the expression of these markers
in mouse xenografted tumors. Immunofluorescence
staining confirmed the expression of ALDH and CD133
in fresh xenograft tissues (Fig. 3C and 3D). The process
of EMT has been played a critical role in tissue and vessel
invasion. Regarding that CSCs also express some features
of EMT, we tried to determine whether ALDHbr tumor
cells harbored EMT phenotype such as expression of the
EMT markers. To test this phenomenon, we co-stained
with a fluorescent dye-conjugated antibody for the EMT
marker vimentin. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed
that ALDHbr cells co-expressed vimentin in fresh
xenografted lung cancer tissues (Fig. 3E), indicating the
fresh lung cancer cells express multiple potential cancer
stem cell markers and some of these cells also possess
EMT properties.

and found that the percentage of ALDHbr cells derived
from H1299 xenografts of mice treated with SAHA
was 0.2% ± 0.04 (Fig. 4A), which was around a 11-fold
reduction (Fig. 4B) compared with that of the cells directly
isolated from the mice treated with vehicle alone (Fig.
4A). Confocal microscopic images further confirmed the
existence of ALDHbr cells in our lung cancer xenograft
models and effective suppression of the ALDHbr cells by
SAHA treatment in the in vivo experiment (Supplement
2.).

SAHA enhances the migration ability in ALDHbr
cells sorted from H1299 xenografts
To determine the metastatic capacity of these cell
populations after SAHA treatment, tumor cells from
mouse xenografts were sorted using ALDEFLUOR assay
and the ALDHbr cells from xenografts of the mice treated
with SAHA or vehicle alone were further examined
by Matrigel invasion assay. As shown in Fig. 5, the
percentage of ALDHbr H1299 cells from the mice treated
with SAHA capable of invasion through Matrigel was at
least 1.9-fold higher than that of the Aldefluor-positive
H1299 cells from vehicle-treated controls (P< 0.05). These
results suggest that although SAHA suppressed the growth
of tumor xenografts and decreased the CSCs population in
vivo, the residual CSCs seems more invasive.

SAHA reduces the population of ALDHbr cells in
H1299 xenografts
To further validate the antitumor effects of SAHA
in vivo, we isolated ALDHbr cells from xenograft tumors
based on the previously described [23-29]. We also

cell programs) were not downregulated instead of more
pronounced and highly upreglated after SAHA treatment.
Based on previous literatures, the rest of upregulated
genes were associated with stem cell functions, including
cell cycle regulation, mitosis, and proliferation or
biological processes, including transporters, protein
binding, regulation of transcription, signal transduction,
metabolism and cell movement (Fig. 5B).
Gene expression of four upregulated genes in
ALDHbr cells from SAHA-treated mouse xenografts
was valiadated by qRT-PCR . It showed significantly
higher expression of the pluripotency genes, ASPM and
RASSF8, at the mRNA levels compared to the ALDHbr
cells from vehicle-treated mouse xenografts and unsorted
population. It also showed higher mRNA expression of the
EMT gene (KCNMA1) and drug-resistant related gene,
(MORF4L2) (Fig. 5C). These results illustrate that the
genes associated with pluripotency are induced by SAHA
and help to unravel the mechanism of HDAC inhibitor on
proliferation and survival of human lung CSCs.

One novelty of this study was to identify the
potential target against CSCs by in vivo molecular imaging
method. To understand the biology of ALDHbr cells from
mice xenografts treated with SAHA, we analyzed the
gene profiles of ALDHbr cells using microarray technique.
Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was applied
to the four samples (ALDHbr and ALDHlo cells from
H1299 xenografts with SAHA administration or vehicle
controls) and found 37 interested genes with different
expression between ALDHbr cells and SAHA-treated
mouse xenografts and from vehicle-treated controls (Fig.
5A, fold change > 2.0, P< 0.05). Owing to the observed
reduction of the ALDHbr population, we expected that
the downregulation effect should be noticed in these
CSC-related pathways after HDAC inhibitor treatment.
However, these gene set (ALDH3A2, CDC42, FGF7, stem

ALDHbr tumor cells from mice received SAHA treatment
were larger and higher than that of the mice received
DMSO treatment (Fig. 6B). As indicated in Fig. 6C,
the size and latency of tumor formation correlated with
the number of injected cells, where 1,000 ALDHbr cells
resulted in tumor growth in 2 of 4 mice which received
SAHA administration. In SAHA-treated xenografts,
injection with cell numbers greater than 2,000 was capable
of developing tumors in all experimental animals. Taken
together, these findings indicate that SAHA might have
limited effect on eradication of ALDHbr lung CSCs;
moreover, the residual ALDHbr cells exhibited enhanced
tumorigenic potential in vivo.

To further determine the efficacy of SAHA
treatment on cancer stem cells sorted from xenografts,
we electronically sorted ALDHbr and ALDHlo cells from
SAHA or vehicle-treated H1299 xenografts, respectively.
Variable numbers of sorted cells were immediately
implanted into nude mice by subcutaneous injection, and
tumor formation was observed up to 24 weeks to avoid
underestimating the tumor initiating cells (TIC) frequency
by a short observation time. The capacity of in vivo tumor
formation with sorted cells was different between these
groups. Only the injection of ALDHbr cells gave rise to
visible tumors, particularly at low numbers of injected
cells (1,000 cells), whereas little or no tumors were
observed with ALDHlo cells, even when as many as 8,000
cells were injected (Fig.6A). Moreover, we found that

Discussion
In the current study, we used cells to develop a
simpler method for isolating CSCs directly from excised
H1299 xenografts, without any in vitro culture step.

identify the specific cell surface markers that discriminate
stem cells from their differentiated progeny of which the
expression may also be dynamic and influenced by the
local microenvironment. The majority of published reports
on human lung cancer stem cells used commercially
available lung cancer cell lines or “the cells” isolated from
in vitro formed spheres [7, 34]. However, the biologic
chracteristics of tumorspheres was far from CSCs in real
tumors due to the distinct environments, a network of
cytokines and growth factors, including the interaction
with the mesenchymal stem cells, tumor associated
fibroblasts, adipocytes, immune cells, and endothelial
cells [9] which are lacking in the serum-free suspension
culture system. Direct isolation of CSCs from xenograft
models also has its defect. Macrophages, fibroblasts and
other cells may express some stem cell markers, such as
CD44 and CD24. As these cells are substantial populations
in the tumor mass and may promote tumorigenesis, it
is important to avoid their contamination in the lung
cancer stem cell compartments. Unlike the previously
described CSC phenotype, which might require the use
of a combination of several surface antigens, our reporter
gene-labelled cells and the ALDEFLUOR assay would be
a more effective approach for defining and isolating an
enriched lung CSC population from xenografts and might
be potentially amenable to clinical applications.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have been
shown to be promising drugs for the treatment of a number
of hematological malignancies including cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma [12] and peripheral T-cell in clinical trials [35].
However, therapeutic trials with the HDACIs in solid
tumors have been disappointing, partly due to resistance to
HDACIs themselves. HDACIs, including TSA and SAHA,
have been applied to facilitate the development of embryo
receiving somatic cell nuclear transfer and to induce
ectopic expression of pluripotency factors for pluripotent
stem cell derivation [36]. It implies a relationship between
HDACIs and CSCs. A recent study has shown that SAHA
could induce EMT phenotype and acquire cancer stem cell
characteristics, which have been known to contribute to
drug-resistant, cancer relapse and metastasis [19]. In the
current study, we found up-regulation of the expression
of metastatic genes in sorted ALDHbr cells treated with
SAHA; this is in consistent with the increased CSC
properties of SAHA treated cells. How does SAHA
modulate CSCs in our xenograft model warrants further
investigations.
The current study provided evidences of the
effect of SAHA on lung CSCs. First, SAHA treatment
significantly enhanced the stemness properties of H1299
lung cancer cells, of which the ALDH-expressing cells
expressed high levels of stem cell-associated genes,
efficiently formed tumorspheres and displayed high
metastatic ability after SAHA administration. In contrast,
previous studies revealed that SAHA could suppress the
growth of tumor xenografts in vivo [37, 38]. The current

ALDHbr and Ds-Red double positive cells were regarded
as putative CSCs, because the Ds-Red expression
excluded other stem cell derived from the mice. By using
ALDEFLUOR assay for detecting ALDH expression
followed by standard FACS analysis, we successfully
isolated ALDHbr cells and found that SAHA can suppress
the growth of tumor xenografts and decreases the lung
CSC population in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that
residual ALDHbr cells from SAHA-treated mice exhibited
properties of cancer stem cells, including high capacity
of tumorigenesis, metastasis and stem cell-related gene
expression.
CSCs and normal stem cells express similar
surface markers, by which they can be identified and
characterized. There has been no specific marker for the
isolation and characterization of CSCs from different
type of tumors to date [30]. The rigorous identification
and isolation of tissue-specific CSCs has thus far been
accomplished in only a few human organ systems. An
overview of the techniques for the characterization of
CSCs from the literatures shows controversial results.
A Hoechst 33342 efflux assay in combination with flow
cytometry has been used to identify and isolate ‘‘side
populations,’’ which are enriched in cancer stem-like cells.
Although the assay shows high efficiency in isolating side
populations, the toxicity associated with the Hoechst
33342 dye creates bias by selectively injuring the non-side
population cells that might affect subsequent functional
stem cell assays in vitro and in vivo [31]. Furthermore,
recent report even suggested that side populations in some
tumors might not represent CSCs [32]. Flow cytometry
methods using cell surface markers have been successfully
applied to the mouse and human samples to isolate stem
cell populations, but the choice of markers can greatly
vary depending on different tissues or species. Besides,
the markers used in mouse to sort specific stem cell
populations are rarely valid in human. Non-SP cells or
CD133-/low cells can also generate tumors in NOD/SCID
mice [4, 5]. These studies imply that only using one kind
of technique such as cell surface markers or SP is not
precise enough to isolate CSCs. Moreover, recent study
further indicated that non-CS/PCs and CS/PCs of each
subpopulation are interconvertible [33], which means
that it is extremely difficult to identify CSCs in a tumor.
Seeking a reliable marker to screen tumor-initiating cells
without the influence on their biological characteristics
becomes extremely critical.
We choose the ALDH marker as a starting point
based on the prior work on lung CSCs, of which the cells
with high ALDH activity were identified as putative CSCs
[7]. Different from other CSC markers, ALDHbr cells
are viable and are selectable by their fluorescence, thus
avoiding the toxicity associated with Hoechst 33342 on
the isolated cells. Furthermore, the ALDEFLUOR assay
is based on the enzymatic activity of ALDH rather than
cell surface phenotype and therefore it is not necessary to

associated [41].
Although our results showed that a subpopulation
of lung cancer cells exists within the H1299 xenografted
tumors with markedly enhanced tumorigenic potential
and stem cell properties after SAHA treatment, there
are limitations to our study. First, high ALDH activity
might not be as a universal marker for stem cells that
may infer the use of ALDEFLUOR assay for identifying
CSCs. It has also been demonstrated that isolated ALDHbr
cells expressed lower proliferative rate and migration
ability as compared with ALDHlo cells in adipose tissue
[42]. Thus, it is critical to carefully characterize the
cells isolated based on high ALDH activity. Second, an
established xenografted tumor rather than primary tumor
directly obtained from the patient was investigated in this
study. Further research using primary tumor is necessary
to confirm the findings of this study. Third, the SAHAinduced CSCs activation was observed in H1299 cells,
we will perform the parallel studies in other type of lung
cancer cells to demonstrate that this effect globally exists
in most of lung carcinoma cell lines.
We have successfully isolated and characterized
CSCs in vivo from the xenografted H1299 lung cancers in
mice rather than from the tumorspheres by conventional
in vitro methods. The results of the current study revealed
that SAHA treatment can suppress the tumor growth of
H1299 lung cancer, decrease ALDHbr population but
promote CSC characteristics, such as enhancement of the
tumor initiating capacity and the expression of KCNMA1,
MORF4L2 and ASPM genes in the residual subpopulation
of cells with high ALDH activity residing in SAHAtreated xenografted tumor. We thus may propose that
clinical use of SAHA alone in the treatment of solid tumor
should proceed with a great caution.

study demonstrated that administration of SAHA can
inhibit tumor growth and decrease ALDHbr population
simultaneously in mice bearing human H1299 lung
tumors. These findings are in consistent with the results
of clinical trials that SAHA showed anticancer activity in
patients with thyroid, renal cell and urothelial carcinomas
[39], and may imply the possibility of SAHA against
CSCs. However, the controversial results from in vitro
and in vivo or clinical studies point out the importance
of tumor microenvironment that defines the stem cell
niche which might be affected by SAHA administration
as well. Second, the residual ALDHbr cells from SAHAtreated mice exhibited more aggressive phenotype. Using
SAHA-treated xenograft to derive the ALDHbr cells, we
disclosed that these cells had much greater tumorigenicity
and more enhanced invasiveness than that of tumorbearing mice receiving vehicle alone. Third, the qRTPCR results showed that ALDHbr cells markedly increase
the expression of the genes associated with stemness,
metastasis and drug resistance following SAHA treatment.
Interpreting the above data based on the framework of the
CSC theory implies that SAHA might worse the patient
outcome by enhancing malignant characteristics of the
residual CSCs and might be used to explain the limited
effects of SAHA in clinical use.
SAHA has been the first HDACI approved by FDA
and has been tested in several clinical trials. In clinical
studies the effect of single use of SAHA seems to be
minor. Our results disclosed the potential of SAHA to
induce resistance to cancer therapy. The microarray gene
expression data showed up-regulation of certain genes
in SAHA-treated ALDHbr cells which are linked to high
migration capacity, drug resistance, poor prognosis and
could be a potential target for cancer therapy. The current
study disclosed that MORF4L2, KCNMA1 and ASPM
were up-regulated by SAHA treatment. MORF4L2 is
a gene involving in drug metabolism, endocrine system
development and function. MORF4L2, a component of
the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, involves
the activation of oncogene and proto-oncogene-mediated
growth induction, and replicative senescence; these result
in higher levels of DNA repair and suppressed apoptosis
[40]. KCNMA1 gene is related to cancer invasion and
metastasis [20]. A previous study evaluated the relationship
between ASPM and CSCs and revealed that the expression
of ASPM correlates with tumor grade and increases at
recurrence. ASPM was also considered as a marker for
distinguishing stem-like cells from gliomas stromal cells
[21]. Unexpectedly, we found the inconsistent results
on the expression of ASPM and RASFF8 obtained from
microarray and qPCR, respectively. Poor annotation or
crosshybridization are not the reason for this inconsistency,
because this experiment is repeated at least three times.
Instead, it may be explained by a possible difference in
splice variants detected by the two technologies, ASPM
and RASFF8, of which more than one transcript were

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The H1299 human non–small cell lung cancer cell
line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Gibco
Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,100 μg/
mL Streptomycin, and 100 units/mL Penicillin. All cells
were maintained in a 37°C humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
All media and cell culture reagents were purchased
from Life Technologies (San Giuliano Milanese, Italy).
Stable clones are generated by transfection of plasmids
(Supplement 1.) and selected by appropriate antibiotics.

SAHA preparation and administration

sorted tumor cell subsets (5 × 104 cells/mL) were seeded
in ultralow attachment plates (Corning, USA) and grown
in defined serum-free medium composed of RPMI 1640,
hormone mixture B27 (Gibco, USA), 20 ng/mL EGF
(epidermal growth factor; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 10 ng/
mL bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor; Invitrogen,
USA) and 1 μg/mL heparin. The number of spheroids was
counted after 14 days later.

Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was
synthesized as described previously [43]. Male BALB/c
nude (nu/nu) mice with palpable H1299 subcutaneously
xenografted tumors were randomly divided into two
groups (at least four mice/group). All mice in each
groups had tumors size (~100mm3) at the beginning of
treatment. SAHA was dissolved in DMSO in a series of
concentrations. Each mice daily received 100 mg/kg of
SAHA by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration for 10 days.
The control group only received vehicle (DMSO). The
animals were sacrificed on day 11 after SAHA treatment
and the tumors were excised for further experiments.

Quantitative real-time PCR
To determine the changes in the expression level
of ALDHbr cells in microarray data, we performed
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. The total mRNA was
extracted using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit with on
column DNA digestion (Zymo Research Corp., California,
USA). The first strand of cDNA was generated from 1 μg
total RNA using oligo-dT primer and SuperScript® III
Reverse Transcriprase (Invitrogen). Quantitative realtime PCR was run on StepOnePlus real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) with the preset
PCR program, using TaqMan primers for β-actin, ASPM,
KCNMA1, RASSF8, MORF4L2 and TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA)
for dection. The cycle number when the fluorescence first
reachs a preset threshold (Ct), allows the quantification
of the specific template concentraction. Transcripts of the
housekeeping gene β-actin in the same incubations were
used for internal normalization.

Tumor cell isolation
H1299 xenografts were sliced with a surgical blade
and single-cell suspensions were generated by addition
of 1 mg/ml (235 U/ml) collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) for 60 min at 37°C with intermittent
vortexing, followed by homogenization with cell
dissociator (gentleMACS™, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany), and sequentially passage through a
70 μm filter (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Red blood
cells were lysed using 1X Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were washed twice
and subjected to FACS.

ALDEFLUOR assay and separation of the
ALDHbr population by FACS

In vivo tumor formation assays
All the animal protocols in this study were in
accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of
our institution. BALB/C nude mice were used to assess
the in vivo stem cell properties of the ALDEFLUORpositive population with SAHA treatment, compared to
the same population with administration of vehicle only
(DMSO). The H1299 xenografted cells were sorted as
previously described and the tumorigenicity of each
populations of H1299 cells with or without SAHA
treatment was tested by inoculation of limiting dilutions
of cells (1,000, 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 cells) mixed with
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada; 1:1) into
the anaesthetized 6-week-old nude mice, subcutaneously.
Tumor size was measured weekly using a caliper and
tumor volume was calculated using the following formula:
tumor volume = length × width × thickness × 0.523.

To characterize the cells with high levels of
ALDH (ALDHbr), the ALDEFLUOR kit (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) was utilized to isolate
them with from tumor cells. A specific ALDH1 inhibitor,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), was used as a
negative control, and cells were analyzed with a FACSAria
cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The sorting
gates were established using the DsRed-expression cells
for viability and the ALDEFLUOR-stained cells treated
with DEAB as negative controls.

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion assay was performed following the
previous literature with a Boyden chamber (8-μm pore
size) [44].

previously described [45]. The q-value was calculated to
control the multiple testing errors in differential expression
analysis, as previously described [45]. The heat map was
created by the dChip software. More than 2 fold changes
in all chip data were considered as up-regulated.
