Abstract
Communication between leukemia cells and their environment is essential for
the development and progression of leukemia. Exosomes are microvesicles secreted
by many types of cells that contain protein and RNA and mediate intercellular
communication. The involvement of exosomes has been demonstrated in the crosstalk
between leukemic cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells, consequently promoting
the survival of leukemic cells, protection of leukemic cells from the cytotoxic effects
of chemotherapeutic drugs, angiogenesis and cell migration. At the same time,
exosomes can be used for the detection and monitoring of leukemia, with some
advantage over current methods of detection and surveillance. As they are involved
in immune response towards leukemic cells, exosomes can also potentially be
exploited to augment immunotherapy in leukemia. In this review, we first describe the
general characteristics of exosomes and biogenesis of exosomes. We then highlight
the emerging role of exosomes in different types of leukemia. Finally, the clinical
value of exosomes as biomarkers, in vivo drug carriers and novel exosome-based
immunotherapy are discussed.

Introduction

Exosomes are found in most, if not all, biological
fluids including urine, blood, ascites and cerebrospinal
fluid [1, 2]. These nanoparticles contain bilayer-lipid
membrane and have cup-like shape with diameters
between 30 and 150 nm [3]. Ectosomes are another type of
extracellular vesicles typically measured as 150 - 1000 nm
[4]. Exosomes are continuously secreted by cell through
endocytosis in multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) and released
by the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane [3, 5,
6]. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport
(ESCRT) complex consists of an array of membraneassociated proteins and coordinates the process of
MVBs generation [7]. The identification of some ESCRT
proteins, such Alix and Tsg101, in exosomes by proteomic
analysis supports a role for ESCRT complex in exosome
biogenesis [8]. The step wise biogenesis of exosomes is
illustrated in Figure 1. Exosomes characteristically contain

Leukemia is a group of malignant diseases
originating from blood or bone marrow cells, including
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the US alone, there are
more than 50, 000 new cases diagnosed with leukemia per
year. The prognosis of leukemia patients diverges greatly,
largely depending on the type of leukemia and the age
of the patient. Overall, leukemia remains a significant
challenge for hematologists and oncologists as it ranks as
the 5th and 6th most common cancer death in men and
women, respectively (Facts and Statistics 2015, Leukemia
and Lymphoma Society). A better understanding of
leukemogensis will lay the foundation for the development
of novel anti-leukemic therapies.

proteins, MHC class I, MHC class II, heat shock proteins
and the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82,
along with small RNA and messenger RNA found in the
cytoplasm of their cell of origin [8-11]. First discovered in
1983 from sheep reticulocytes, these microvesicles were
initially believed to be a way by which cells disposed of
unnecessary membrane proteins during the process of
maturation [2]. Since then, considerable work has been
done on exosomes and they have been shown to mediate
a variety of physiological and pathological processes via
their interaction with proximal or distant target cells [12].
The functions of exosomes have been demonstrated to
play important roles in the survival and proliferation of
cancer cells and metastasis [13-15]. On the other hand,
exosomes have also been found to be potentially useful
in improving cancer treatment, detection and prognosis
[16, 17]. This review will focus on recent developments
in exosome research in relation to leukemia.

a well-known phenomenon called as immune evasion
or immune escape, which is also a hallmark of cancer.
Cancer cells exploit several immunological mechanisms,
such as down-regulation of target antigens, targeting
regulatory T-cell functions, or secretion of immune
suppressive mediators [18]. Transforming growth factor
beta 1 (TGF-β1) is a major secreted cytokine that inhibits
helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells [19, 20]. It has been
recently demonstrated that exosomes released by leukemic
cells exert an immunosuppressive effect that helps them
evade immune response. Study from Szczepanski and
coworkers demonstrated that sera from AML patients
contained higher level of exosomes and distinct molecule
profiles in exosomes as compared to that of sera from
healthy controls [21]. Exosomes isolated from the sera
of AML patients contain membrane-associated TGF-β1,
which reduces the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to
kill leukemic cells by reducing NKG2D expression and
activating the SMAD pathway [8]. In a follow-up study,
the level of exosomal TGF-β1 has been shown to correlate
to response to chemotherapy in AML patients [22]. Jurkat
and Raji leukemia/lymphoma cells increase their release
of exosomes that express the NKG2D ligands MICA,

proliferation

MICB, ULBP1 and ULBP2 on their membranes. These
ligands bind to NKG2D and impede the NKG2D ligandreceptor pathway in NK cells, thereby reducing their
capacity to kill leukemic cells [9]. Exosomal BAG6, the
ligand for the receptor NKp30 expressed on NK cells, is
essential for NK cells to kill cancer cells and is believed to
be down-regulated or absent in CLL patients as suggested
by the immune suppression observed in CLL patients [10].
In addition, TGF-β1 has also been found to be enriched
in CML-exosomes and treatment with TGF-β1 receptor
inhibitor (SB) significantly reduces exosome-stimulated
cell proliferation and colony formation of CML cells.
Furthermore, Exosomal TGFβ1 also has been shown
to be critical in the formation of tumour-promoting
stroma, down-regulates NKG2D expression and inhibits
CTL response in solid tumor models [23-28]. Taken
together, these evidence suggest exosome-mediated NK
cell dysfunction compromise the immune surveillance
to eliminate leukemic cells in various hematologic
malignancies (Figure 2). TGF-β1 plays a pivotal role in
leukemic exosome-mediated immune escape.

Leukemic cells release exosomes that are
internalized by nearby cells [29, 30]. Through this
process, cancer cells are able to transfer proteins and
RNA to surrounding cells [29, 30]. Moreover, exosomes
are able to travel in extracellular space and deliver
exosomal cargo into distant cells. Exosomes released by
AML cells enrich mRNA transcripts of genes important
to the development of leukemia including GATA1,
FOX3, SHIP1, ID1, E2F1, CEBP-α, CEBP-β, Myc and
MEF2C [29]. Exosomes secreted by LAMA84 CML
cells increase IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in HS5 bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which, in turn, promotes
adherence of LAMA84 cells to a HS5 monolayer [31],
a known promoter of cell survival [32, 33]. LAMA84
cell-derived exosomes also directly promote the survival
of LAMA84 cells by lowering expression of the proapoptotic genes BAD, BAX and PUMA, elevating
expression of anti-apoptotic genes BCL-xL, BCL-w, and
BIRC5. Moreover, these secreted exosomes also increases

Figure 2: Summary of role of exosomes in leukemogenesis. Leukemia-derived exosomes can activate bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) to promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Leukemia-derived exosomes impair the host
immune system to create an immunosuppressive state, facilitating immuoescape of leukemia cells. Leukemia-derived exosomes transfer
pro-angiogenic molecules into endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis and provide a favourable microenvironment for leukemia cells
themselves. Moreover, leukemia-derived exosomes can help leukemia cells develop resistance to apoptosis through transferring prosurvival BCL-2 from apoptosis-resistant AML blasts to apoptosis-sensitive AML cells.

NF-kB and TGF-β1 levels and activates the PI3/AKT
and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways [34]. Infection by
human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1) is one of
the main causes of adult T-cell leukemia [16]. HTLV1
infected T cells release exosomes that contain viral Tax
protein and Tax mRNA transcripts. In addition, they
enhance cell survival in murine and human T-cell cell
lines by increasing levels of phosphorylated AKT and Rb
and protect Jurkat cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by
increasing cFLIP and NF-kB activity, demonstrating an
important role in the development of leukemia played by
exosomes [35] (Figure 2).

kinase family is required for oncogenic signaling by BCRABL, a characteristic feature of CML [40]. Exosomes
isolated from K562 cell culture supernatant induces
phosphorylation of Src protein and activates downstream
Src kinase signaling pathways [38]. Importantly, this
activation process can be blocked by Dasatinib, a BCRABL and Src dual inhibitor [38]. In in vitro experiment,
K562 exosomes stimulate angiotube formation and
increases total cumulative tube length 2-fold compared
with control. MiRNAs are a group of evolutionarily
conserved, single-stranded, 22 nucleotides non-coding
small RNAs. Many miRNAs have been shown to promote
or inhibit tumor angiogenesis though post-transcriptional
regulation of pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic molecules
[41]. One prominent example, oncogenic miR-17-92
family, is known to stimulate angiogenesis in the adjacent
tumor endothelium by direct repression of the secreted,
antiangiogenic molecules thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [42]. Interestingly,
miRNA-92a, a member of miR-17-92 cluster, is found
presence in exosomes released by K562 cells and these
K562 exosomes down-regulate integrin a5, a target
gene of miR-92a, in HUVECs. Enforced expression of

Angiogenesis in leukemia
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels,
is indispensable for tumor progression, especially for
tumors with size more than 1 - 2 mm3 [36, 37]. Exosome
has been increasingly recognized as a new mediator for
this critical step. Exosomes from CML cells induce the
formation of a tube-like structure in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) by transferring miR-92a and
activating SRC signaling [38, 39]. Activation of the Src

miRNA-92a significantly enhances cell migration and tube
formation of HUVECs [39].
Consistent with current knowledge of hypoxia being
a key driver of angiogenesis, CML exosomes secreted
in hypoxic conditions are better able to increase tube
formation in HUVECs compared to exosomes from cells
cultured in normoxia, attributable to heightened exosomal
levels of miR-210 which down-regulated EFNA3, an
inhibitor of angiogenesis [43]. Exosomes from LAMA84
cells increase IL-8 expression and MAPK phosphorylation
in HUVECs, which causes a similar angiogenic effect
[44]. One study investigated the angiogenic role of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by NB4 cells, a
AML-M3 subtype leukemia. In this study, PML-RARa
transcript has been detected in NB4 EVs and taken up
by endothelial cells, resulting in these endothelial cells
being more tissue factor-positive and procoagulant [45].
In summary, these results suggest that leukemia cells
release exosomes containing pro-angiogenic molecules,
which are transferred into endothelial cells to create a
microenvironment favorable to survival and proliferation
of leukemia cells themselves (Figure 2).

family [51]. Galectin-3 functions as a modulator of cellcell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, tumor angiogenesis
and metastasis, immune response and apoptosis [52,
53]. Although contradictory results being reported, in
general, the expression of galectin-3 is significantly
higher in multiple tumors and is an indicator of metastatic
potential [54]. Moreover, galectin-3 can be released by
cancer cells into extracellular environment, thus the
level of galectin-3 in the serum of many types of cancer
patients are higher than healthy controls [55]. Together,
these data suggest that increased expression of cellular
galectin-3 and elevated concentration of galectin-3 in
circulating system may contribute to tumor progression
and metastasis. Several studies unveiled that increased
galectin-3 facilitates leukemia cells escape from apoptotic
stimuli through activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
pathway [56, 57]. High level of galectin-3 expression is
an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients
with AML, a protein associated with chemoresistance
[56-59]. When B lineage ALL cells in co-culture with
BMSCs, the stromal cells provide the ALL cells with
galectin-3. The strong induction of galectin-3 coincides
with observations that ALL cells in contact with OP9 cells
are resistant to nilotinib, a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, and
vincristine [60]. Galectin-3 is enriched in OP9 exosomes,
but not ALL exosomes, and exosomal galectin-3 can be
internalized by ALL cells, and activates NFkB pathway,
which is often linked to anti-apoptosis and drug resistance
[60] (Figure 2).

Chemoresistance
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are an
important component of bone marrow niche and they
may differentiate into bone, cartilage, adipocytes and the
hematopoiesis-supporting stroma. Many studies indicate
that BMSCs enhance survival of leukemia cells and hinder
apoptosis of these cells resulted from chemotherapy [4649]. However, the exact mechanisms of this protection
from chemotherapeutic attack are not fully understood.
Emerging evidence suggests that both the exosomes
released from BMSCs and the leukemia cells themselves
help the leukemia cells to resist chemotherapy. Leukemic
exosomes increase the levels of proteins involved
in chemoresistance in BMSCs, indicating a role in
communication between the cell types and in the transfer
of substances relevant to chemoresistance. Exosomes from
both normal BMSCs and BMSCs from AML patients
reduce the cytotoxic effects of the nucleoside analogue
cytarabine on MOLM-14 cells with FLT3-ITD (internal
tandem duplication) mutation, and only AML-BMSC
derived exosomes provided such protection from AC220
(a FLT3 kinase inhibitor) treatment [50]. The protection
might be associated with elevated level of miRNA-155,
miRNA-375, cytokine epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and TGF-β1 [50]. However, a direct causal effect of these
factors on the chemoresistance has not been interrogated.
Nevertheless, these data imply a few novel approaches
to increase chemosensitivity on AML blasts by either
blocking exosome-leukemia cell communication, or
inhibiting exosome production.
Galectin-3 is a member of the lectin family, as
well as a member of the beta-galactoside-binding protein

Diagnosis and Prognosis
Although useful in detecting disease, current
methods for the diagnosis of leukemia have their
limitations. Flow cytometry depends on the presence of
circulating blasts and is inept at detecting leukemic cells
that persist in the bone marrow in cases where circulating
blasts have been eliminated by chemotherapy. Another
currently employed method of detection is bone marrow
aspiration, which is invasive and carries the risk of false
negatives as the sample taken is not representative of all
bone marrow tissue [61]. Due to their ubiquity in bodily
fluids and cargo of proteins and RNA representative of
their cells of origin, exosomes may contain biomarkers for
cancer [62]. In other types of cancer such as pancreatic
cancer, exosomal biomarker, Glypican-1, has already
demonstrated ability to distinguish between healthy
controls and advanced cancer patients with 100% accuracy
[63]. Exosomal miRNA can be quantified from exosomes
from just 20 μL of serum [62], allowing for a non-invasive
method of detection of leukemia. Microvesicles are found
in higher concentrations in the sera of AML, CML and
CLL patients and abundantly express surface proteins
unique to their cell of origin, which is rarely observed
from serum microvesicles of normal controls [64]. AML
biomarkers NPM1, FLT3, CXCR4, MMP9 and IGF-IR are

also present in AML cell derived exosomes, along with
mRNAs involved in leukemia development [29]. Isolation
and analysis of serum exosomes can therefore shed light
on the presence and progression of leukemia. In the case of
CLL, the concentration of microvesicles and microvesicles
expressing CD19 was directly proportional to leukemia
advancement [64]. Recent research into the use of serum
exosomes for diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia has
produced promising results, with findings that exosomal
TGF-β1 levels and relative levels of the three TGF-β1
forms (TGF-β1 pro-peptide, latency-associated peptide
(LAP), and mature TGF-β1) were distinct in AML
patients in different stages of chemotherapy [22], and that
a grading system based on exosomal levels of miR-150,
miR-155, miR-221 and miR-1246 was able to effectively
distinguish AML cell xenografted mice from control mice
[61]. Given the advantage that exosomal cargos, especially
miRNAs, are protected from degradation by ribonuclease
in the extracellular space, this stability makes exosomes
as suitable mines for hunting reproducible and consistent
biomarkers.

[43].

Another potential use of exosomes in leukemia
treatment is in the treatment of graft versus host disease
(GvHD). GvHD can develop following hematopoietic
stem cell or bone marrow transplantation and involves
attack on the recipient’s tissues by the donor’s immune
cells. Injections of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
are more effective at treating GvHD than conventional
immunosuppressants [79]. It is possible that exosomes
play a role the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs, as
injections of MSC-derived exosomes were effective at
treating GvHD and were able to reduce secretion of the
cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells [62]. It should also be noted that
exosomes could replace liposomes as a vector in delivery
of chemotherapeutic drugs. Exosomal delivery system
would have the added benefits of slower removal from the
bloodstream leading to increased effectiveness of delivery,
as well as higher specificity for target cells [80-82].

Conclusions

Treatment of leukemia

Exosomes are endosome-derived, membraneous
nano-size microvesicles actively secreted by wide range
of normal cells, as well as malignant cells. Leukemic
cell derived exosomes contain cargoes such as miRNAs,
proteins, mRNA, etc, which might represent a snapshot of
the disease states of a leukemia patients. These cargoes,
some of which are oncogenic, can be transferred into
neighbor cells or distant cells and impact the behaviors
of these receipt cells. Thus, exosome-mediated cell-cell
communications could play potential important roles
during leukemia development. Many studies provide
evidence that exosomes are involved in survival and
proliferation of leukemic cells, resistance to apoptosis
and chemotherapeutic drugs, angiogenesis and migration.
Notably, there is great interest in identification of
exosomal biomarkers from blood samples for both
diagnosis and stratification of leukemia patients. Although
some pioneer studies reported some potential biomarkers,
such as exosomal miR-126 in CLL, exosomal IGF-1R
and TGF-β1 in AML, the real clinical utilities of these
biomarkers are waiting for validation in large, perspective
clinical trials. The potential use of exosomes to deliver
tumor-derived antigens to elicit an immune response to
specific cancer antigens has been confirmed in several
phase I and II clinical trials in melanoma, non-small cell
lung cancer and colorectal cancer [83-85]. Although there
is no similar studies conducted in leukemia patient, it is
not a stretch to employ exosome-based immunotherapy
alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy
to treat leukemia, as illustrated in Figure 3. Another
therapeutic approach which has attracted considerable
attention involves the utility of exosomes as an efficient
in vivo delivery system for drugs, proteins, miRNA,
small interfering RNA (siRNA), antibodies, and many

The relevance of exosomes in leukemia
treatment comes mainly from its potential use in the
loading of dendritic cells (DCs) [65], as drug delivery
system or delivery vector for siRNA [66] or miRNA
[67]. Other therapeutic strategies are to target tumor
exosomes by either inhibition of their biogenesis [6870] or extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes [71].
Suppression of exosome production by indomethacin has
been shown to increase chemotherapeutic sensitivities of
B-cell lymphoma [70]. DCs present cancer cell antigens
on MHC class I or class II to T cells to bring about
cytotoxicity towards cancer cells [72]. DC mediated
immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy produces
the longest survival times in DBA2 mice bearing murine
L1210 lymphocytic leukemia tumor [73]. In studies
involving both human and murine leukemia cells, loading
of DCs with leukemic exosomes resulted in T cells having
greater ability to kill leukemic cells compared to DCs
alone or DCs loaded using leukemic cell lysate [74, 75].
Exposure to leukemic exosomes before the introduction
of leukemic cells also increased cytotoxic activity towards
leukemic cells and impeded tumor growth [76]. Antigens
can be artificially introduced to exosomes. For example,
gp350, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein, is expressed
on the surfaces of exosomes released by HEK293 cells
transfected with gp350. Gp350 binds to CD19 found on B
cells and specifically targets them, delivering proteins such
as CD154 that activated T cells and caused the B cells
to be killed more effectively [77]. Meanwhile, exosomes
released by DCs have been shown to induce immune
response [78], the effectiveness of which can be increased
by pulsing DC-derived exosomes with leukemic antigens

bioengineering field, we would anticipate a line of such
exosome-wrapped novel therapeutic agents will be tested
in clinical trials in near future. A deep understanding the
exact characteristics, biogenesis and function of leukemia
exosomes, as well as in the in vivo impact of exosomes
on the different components of host immune system, may
improve our ability to utilize exosomes as biomarkers,
therapeutic vehicles and therapeutic targets.
