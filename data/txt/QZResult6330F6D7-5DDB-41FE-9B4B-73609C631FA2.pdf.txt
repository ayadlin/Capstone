ABSTRACT
Tanshinone is the liposoluble constituent of Salia miltiorrhiza, a root used
in traditional herbal medicine which is known to possess certain health benefits.
Although it is known that tanshinones, including tanshinone I (T1), tanshinone IIA
(T2A), and cryptotanshinone (CT), can inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro,
the mechanism under which they act is still unclear. AURKA, an oncogene, encodes
a serine-threonine kinase which regulates mitotic processes in mammalian cells.
Here, we reported that tanshinones mediate AURKA suppression partly through upregulating the expression of miR-32. We found that tanshinones could inhibit cell
proliferation, promote apoptosis, and impede cell-cycle progression, thus performing
an antineoplastic function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, we
demonstrated that tanshinones attained these effects in part by down-regulating
AURKA, corroborating previous reports. Our results showed that in NSCLC, similar
effects were obtained with knock-down of the AURKA gene by siRNA. We also verified
that AURKA was the direct target of miR-32. Collectively, our results demonstrated
that tanshinones could inhibit NSCLC by suppressing AURKA via up-regulating the
expressions of miR-32 and other related miRNAs.

and interdicting cell cycle progression, angiogenesis,
cell invasion and metastasis [6–9]. Related studies
have indicated that tanshinones might effectively target
human lung cancer cells and could inhibit growth by
induction of apoptosis [6, 10–12]. Thus, it is reasonable
to speculate that tanshinones would play an important
role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Research shows that tanshinone molecules
inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro [13] and
that the mechanism may be via interruption of cell cycle
progression and induction of cell apoptosis, resulting in
down-regulation in the expression of cell-cycle related
proteins, Aurora A and Cyclin B, as well as the apoptosis
related protein Bcl2.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there have been several advances
in the treatment of lung cancer, notably a diversification
in therapeutic drugs, as well as mode of treatment.
Among these, targeted therapies have taken the
forefront based on such features as efficiency and
a low rate of adverse reactions [1–4]. Tanshinones,
including tanshinone I (T1), tanshinone IIA (T2A), and
cryptotanshinone (CT), are the liposoluble constituents
of Salia miltiorrhiza, a traditional herbal therapy which
has favorable medicinal value [5]. Of particular interest
is tanshinone’s cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, which
is thought to act primarily through inducting apoptosis

Aurora A is a serine-threonine kinase encoded by the
AURKA (aurora kinase A) gene, which is responsible for
regulating mitotic processes in mammalian cells, including
centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and chromosome
segregation. Various types of cancers exhibit amplification of
AURKA and serious effects such as chromosomal instability,
centrosomal amplification/aneuploidy, therapeutic resistance,
cell-cycle progression and anti-apoptosis are induced by
overexpression of AURKA. Synergistically, these events
promote the progression of cancer. Hence, AURKA can be
considered an oncogene and thus an important target for
cancer therapy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single stranded
small non-coding RNA. They are about 18–23 nucleotides (nt)
in length, encoded by an endogenous gene, and regulate gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level. Importantly, altered
expression of miRNAs is reported in a variety of human
cancers and may be associated with cancer pathogenesis,
tumor growth, and metastasis [14, 15]. Because miRNAs
play a regulatory role in the tumorigenesis process and can
regulate the expression of tumor associated genes [15–17],
we proposed that tanshinones may regulate the expression of
AURKA via adjusting the expression of related miRNAs.

in several NSCLC cell lines, such as H1299, A549, and
SPCA-1. The results showed that tanshinones could inhibit
the proliferation of NSCLC cells in a time- and dosedependent manner (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure
S1A–S1B) and that cell proliferation was significantly
inhibited by tanshinones at concentrations of 2 μM/4 μM
for T1, 2 μM/4 μM for T2A, and 5  μM/7.5  μM for CT
(P < 0.005/0.001) in H1299 cells (Figure 1A). In addition,
results also indicated that T1 was the most effective of
the tanshinones tested and that DMSO, the solvent of
tanshinones, had no effect on cell proliferation.
The H1299 cell line was chosen to test the effects of
tanshinones on apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell migration.
The percentages of apoptotic cells in the tanshinonetreated groups were much higher than in the control
(Figure 1B). Following treatment with tanshinones, the
proportion of cells at the G0/G1 phase increased more than
10% as compared with the control (Figure 1C). Almost no
difference was observed in the ability of cell migration
between the experimental groups and the control group
(Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggested
that tanshinones could significantly promote apoptosis
(Figure 1B) and cause G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest (Figure 1C)
in H1299 cells. Thus tanshinones could exhibit an
important antineoplastic effect in NSCLC tumor cells via
inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of apoptosis,
and retardation of cell-cycle progression.

RESULTS
Tanshinones inhibit cell proliferation, promote
apoptosis and impede cell-cycle progression
in NSCLC

Tanshinones inhibit NSCLC by down-regulating
the expression of AURKA

To verify the suppression role of tanshinones in
NSCLC, we first measured its anti-proliferative effects

Li et al. [13] found that, in NSCLC, the suppressive
effect of tanshinones may be due partly to down-regulation

Tanshinones suppress AURKA partly via
up-regulating the expression of miR-32

of AURKA. To confirm this, we checked the variation of
AURKA mRNA and protein after exposure to tanshinones
(Figure 2A). Our data revealed that, in H1299 cells incubated
for 48 h with 4 μM T1, 4 μM T2A, or 5 μM CT, the contents
of AURKA mRNA and protein were much lower than
the control group (DMSO 5 μM for 48 h) (Figure 2A).
This result indicated that tanshinones could suppress the
expression of AURKA. To further study the role of AURKA
in NSCLC, we knocked down AURKA using siRNA and
then surveyed the change in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and cell-cycle progression. After 24 h post-transfection with
siAURKA/siNC, the content of AURKA mRNA decreased
by almost 90% as compared to the control (Figure 2B). The
Aurora A protein decreased about 60% after transfection
for 24 h (Figure 2B). Results additionally showed that
knocked-down of AURKA could suppress cell proliferation,
accelerate apoptosis, and impede cell-cycle progression in an
effect similar to that of tanshinones treatment (Figure 2C–
2E). Besides, we measured the endogenous expression level
of AURKA in common NSCLC cell lines and found that the
expression level of AURKA in H1299 cells was almost 7
times of in BEAS-2B, control cells (Supplementary Figure
S3). In SPCA-1, the expression level of AURKA was about
treble of in BEAS-2B. There approximately no difference
between in A549 and in BEAS-2B. This result could explain
why H1299 cells were much more sensitive to tanshinones
than SPCA-1 and A549 cells (Figure 1A, Supplementary
Figure S1A–S1B). Based on the above-mentioned results, it
is reasonable to surmise that tanshinones restrain NSCLC in
part by down-regulating the expression of AURKA.

Although we know of the relationship between
tanshinones and AURKA, the mechanism by which
tanshinones regulate AURKA is still unclear. It has been
well established that miRNAs regulate gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level and that abnormal expression
and regulation of miRNAs are critically involved in
tumorigenesis and tumor progression. MiRNAs can
regulate the expression of tumor associated genes and play
a central role in the tumorigenesis process. Therefore, we
propose that tanshinones may regulate the expression of
AURKA by adjusting the expression of related miRNA.
We searched for miRNAs that might target AURKA and
select the most promising ones for further investigation
by TargetScanHuman 6.2, StarBase v2.0, miRanda and
http://microRNA.org (Supplementary Table 1). Although
miR-34a was not part of the original list, we still tested it
because of its explicit antitumor effect in lung cancer and
its place as one of the miRNAs our group has researched
[18]. Results from qRT-PCR assays showed that the
expression levels of the miRNAs being tested (let-7b/c,
miR-25, miR-32, miR-34a, miR-92a/b, miR-137, miR363, and miR-367) were significantly up-regulated by
tanshinones (T1, T2A, and CT) (Figure 3A, Supplementary
Figure S4). We next focused on miR-32, as it has been
reported that it may be an anti-oncogene in lung cancer
but that its mechanism in NSCLC has yet to be brought to
light [19–21]. We set out to unmask the target relationship

between miR-32 and AURKA. Data from the luciferase
reporter assay revealed that there was a miR-32 binding
site at 3′-UTR (357-379 bp) of AURKA (Figure 3B). Our
results further showed that miR-32 mimic could downregulate the expressions of AURKA mRNA and protein
(Figure 3C). These data suggested that miR-32 targeted
AURKA and that tanshinones suppressed AURKA by
regulating the expression levels of miR-32 and other
interrelated miRNAs.

up-regulated in NSCLC (Supplementary Figure S5). When
considering that one miRNA may target several genes and
that a single gene could be the target of multiple miRNAs
[23–27] along with negative feedback mechanisms that can
exist in cells [28–30], it’s reasonable to assume that one
single miRNA may not have a remarkable effect on tumor
suppression or promotion. According to these results as well
as previous research, we concluded that miR-32 could play
the role of tumor suppressor in NSCLC.

miR-32 acts as a tumor suppressor gene
in NSCLC

DISCUSSION

Previous studies [19–21] indicated that miR-32 may
be a tumor suppressor gene and our results confirmed that it
could inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis of tumor
cells in NSCLC, but that it had no obvious effect on cell-cycle
progression (Figure 4A–4C). We found that the antitumor
effect of miR-32 was not conspicuous in H1299 cells, but we
also measured the endogenous expression level of miR-32
in the other common NSCLC cell lines and found that the
expression level of miR-32 in H1299 cells was much lower
compared to BEAS-2B, control cells (Figure 4D). Jalava et
al reported that androgen receptor (AR) could regulate miR32 expression by binding ARBS (AR-binding site) near the
miR-32 genomic location [22]. Our results demonstrated
tanshinones treatment can down-regulate the expression
of AR, and at the same time the expression of miR-32 is

The value of tanshinones is well-known in both
traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine.
As stated before, tanshinones have a cytotoxic effect
on tumor cells via inducing apoptosis, arresting cellcycle progression, restraining angiogenesis, suppressing
invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we proved
that tanshinones (T1, T2A and CT) could significantly
inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cell lines in vitro via
inducing apoptosis and retarding cell-cycle progression.
These attributes might make it an ideal medicine for
NSCLC treatment. Because there were still many details yet
unknown about the primary mechanism of the suppression
of NSCLC by tanshinones, it was necessary to validate
whether tanshinones exhibited toxicity and if there was the
presence of any by-effects on normal human cells.

AURKA is a member of a novel oncogenic family
of mitotic serine/threonine kinases. Abundant evidence
suggests a role for AURKA in centrosome maturation [31],
spindle formation [32], and G2-M transition [33]. AURKA is
frequently over expressed in different types of cancer [34–37]
and suppression of AURKA expression and function reduces
tumor growth [38–40]. Tumorigenesis is strongly related to
abnormal amplification and expression of AURKA, which
has led to the recognition of AURKA as an important
molecular target for cancer therapy [41, 42]. Our studies
showed that tanshinones down regulated the expression level
of AURKA in vitro (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure S6).
These results suggest that AURKA is a novel and important
molecular target for tanshinones.
The interrelation between tanshinones and AURKA
has been preliminarily investigated, but the mechanism by
which tanshinones up-regulate the expression of AURKA
is still unclear. Herein, we validated the regulatory
relationship between tanshinones and AURKA and defined
the effects of AURKA in NSCLC. Above all, we found
that tanshinones suppressed AURKA through regulating
the expression levels of miR-32 and other interrelated
miRNAs, and that AURKA is the direct target of miR-32.
Nevertheless, the mechanism for regulation of miRNAs by
tanshinones is almost utterly ignorant. In the near future,
we hope to commence investigation on this topic.
In summary, our study identified a novel network
delineating the method by which tanshinones suppress
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NSCLC, first linking tanshinones with miRNAs and
preliminary expounding the mechanism for this in NSCLC.
Scientifically, this finding suggests tanshinones could
efficiently be used as a targeted therapy in the treatment of
NSCLC. Clinically, this study suggests AURKA as an ideal
target for inhibiting cancer progression in NSCLC patients.
Based on our results thus far, we were able to
summarize the mechanism by which tanshinones
suppress NSCLC (Figure 5). Tanshinones can up-regulate
the expression levels of tested miRNAs (Figure 3A,
Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary Figure S6),
among these is let-7, a well-known tumor suppressor
that can inhibit the development of lung cancer [43–45].
Our previous research revealed that miR-34a targets
TGFβR2 which inhibits apoptosis in NSCLC [46]
and in recent years, many studies have verified that
miR-34a could inhibit tumor progression in lung cancer
[47, 48]. It was reported that miR-25, miR-32 and miR92a/b are in the same miRNA family [49] and based
on this, they may play roles in a specific cancer. miR25 inhibition led to autophagic cell death by directly
increasing ULK1 expression in breast cancer cell [50].
MiR-32 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation and
invasion by targeting Sox9 [20], however miR-92a/b
as oncogene, promotes cell proliferation and invasion
in cancer [24, 51]. miR-25 family plays muti-roles in
cancergenisis, we first report that T1 promotes miR-25
family and suppress the growth of NSCLC.

Figure 5: Model of identified mechanism how tanshinone suppresses NSCLC. Tanshinone played a role of tumor suppressor
in NSCLC by up-regulating several miRNAs to suppress genes which related to the cancer process.

Our results demonstrated that miR-32 can suppress
NSCLC by targeting AURKA (Figure 3B/3C, Figure 4) and
it has been published that AURKA can suppress the effects
of p53 [52, 53], an anti-oncogene which can up-regulate
the expression level of miR-34a [54]. We also checked the
the variation of AURKA/p53 mRNA and related miRNAs
after exposure to tanshinones (Supplementary Figure S6).
The result showed that, in SPCA-1 cells incubated for
48 h with 4 μM T1, 6 μM T2A, the content of AURKA
mRNA was much lower than the control group (DMSO
6 μM for 48 h) (Supplementary Figure S6). To the contrary,
the contents of p53 mRNA and miRNAs were mucher
higher than control group. This result indirectly proved
that tanshinones could abolish the AURKA mediated p53
suppression and up-regulate the expressions of related
miRNA. Comprehensively, tanshinones suppress NSCLC
mainly through up-regulating anti-oncogene miRNAs to
suppress their target genes that promote cancer progression,
therefore giving tanshinones the ultimate effect of
promoting apoptosis and arresting cell-cycle (Figure 5).

were plated in a 96-well microplate (Corning Incorporated,
Shanghai, China) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Data were obtained from the measurement
of 4 replicate wells for each data point. After incubation
for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h, 10 μl of CCK-8 solution was
added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 60 min.
The absorbance was then measured by a multi-function
enzyme-linked analyzer, FLx8 (BioTek, Shanghai, China),
at the wavelength of 450 nm (OD, cell survival state).

Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein samples were
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, USA). The
membrane was then soaked in tris-buffered saline Tween-20
buffer (TBST) (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 0 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween-20) with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking and
subsequently incubated with specific antibody against
AURKA (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
USA) or GAPDH (1:1000, ABclonal Technology, Wuhan,
China) antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at
4°C. Afterwards, the membrane was washed and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:10000, Signalway Antibody, Nanjing,
China) for 1 h. Finally, protein bands were detected by a
chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore Corporation),
quantitated by densitometric analysis using the Image Lab
analysis software (Bio-Rad), and expressed as percentage of
control after normalization to GAPDH.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Following the manufacturers’ instructions, total
RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Sangon Biotech,
Shanghai, China) and cDNA synthesis was performed with
the PrimeScript™ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit or SYBR®
PrimeScript™miRNA RT -PCR Kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green II
(TaKaRa a) on a CFX96™ Real-time System (Bio-Rad,
Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The expression levels of miRNAs were normalized to the
U6 expression level. The expression levels of mRNAs were
normalized to the 18S expression level.

Dual luciferase reporter assay
The wild type human AURKA 3′-UTR firefly
luciferase construct (pGL3-AURKA-3′-UTR-wt) was
generated by inserting a 719 bp fragment of human
AURKA 3′-UTR into the EcoR V/EcoR I sites of the
pGL3 miReport vector. The pGL3-AURKA-3′-UTRmut construct was generated by mutating the putative
miR-32-binding site on pGL3-AURKA-3′-UTR-wt. As
a control for transfection efficiency, plasmid expressing
the renilla luciferase gene (pRL) was cotransfected into
each transfection experiment. Cells were harvested 48 h
after transfection and luciferase activity was assayed by
an Orion II Microplate Illuminometer (Titertek-Berthold,
South San Francisco, USA). Relative activities were
expressed as the fold-change in luciferase activity after
normalization to renilla luciferase activity. All constructs
were sequenced to verify integrity. All the primers used in
this paper are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Cell apoptosis analysis
Cell apoptosis was determined by the Annexin
V-FITC/ propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit
(BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells (1×105 cells) were collected by trypsinization
and centrifugation, then washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The cells were then resuspended
in 100 μL 1× binding buffer, to which 5 μL of Annexin
V-FITC and 5 μL of PI were added and incubated at room
temperature for 15 min in the dark, after which 400 μL 1×
binding buffer was added and mixed. Apoptotic cells were
analyzed by a MoFlo XDP flow cytometry sorting system
(Beckman Coulter, Mountain View, CA).

Cell cycle analysis

Statistical analysis

Treated cells (1×105 cells) were harvested and fixed
with 75% ethanol at −20°C overnight, then washed twice
with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in 250 μL
of RNase A buffer (100 ng/mL) and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. After this incubation 2×PI (100
ng/mL) was added into the mixture and incubated for 15
min in the dark, followed by filtration with a 200 mesh
filter membrane. Cell cycle was determined based on
analysis on the MoFlo XDP flow cytometry sorting system
(Becton Dickinson).

Results were represented as the mean ± SEM
and difference between two experimental groups was
evaluated using student’s t-test with statistical significance
defined as P < 0.05.
