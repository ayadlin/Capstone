Abstract
Despite the prevalence of KRAS mutations in human cancers, there remain no targeted therapies for
treatment. The serine–threonine kinase STK33 has been proposed to be required for the survival of mutant
KRAS-dependent cell lines, suggesting that small molecule kinase inhibitors of STK33 may be useful to treat
KRAS-dependent tumors. In this study, we investigated the role of STK33 in mutant KRAS human cancer cells
using RNA interference, dominant mutant overexpression, and small molecule inhibitors. As expected, KRAS
downregulation decreased the survival of KRAS-dependent cells. In contrast, STK33 downregulation or
dominant mutant overexpression had no effect on KRAS signaling or survival of these cells. Similarly, a
synthetic lethal siRNA screen conducted in a broad panel of KRAS wild-type or mutant cells identified KRAS but
not STK33 as essential for survival. We also obtained similar negative results using small molecule inhibitors of
the STK33 kinase identified by high-throughput screening. Taken together, our findings refute earlier proposals
that STK33 inhibition may be a useful therapeutic approach to target human KRAS mutant tumors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
KRAS activating mutations are present in approximately
30% of human cancers, making KRAS one of the most
frequently mutated oncogenes. Multiple preclinical studies
in vitro and in vivo have shown that blocking the activity of
mutant KRAS is an effective way to inhibit tumor growth,
suggesting that drugs that block this pathway could be
effective anticancer therapies (1). Strategies to target KRAS
directly, such as downregulating its expression or disrupting
its membrane localization through farnesyltransferase inhibitors or geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, have not yet been
successful in the clinic (2). Multiple attempts to target KRAS
indirectly by blocking its effectors have been undertaken and
some are still being tested. For example, potent and selective
inhibitors of MAP/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) are currently
being tested in several clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Although some of these efforts seem promising, a more
complete understanding of the complex and extensive network of KRAS effectors and regulators may provide alternative
and more efficient therapeutics. Several investigators have
sought to directly identify critical effectors of KRAS through
genetic manipulations. For example, screening for synthetic
lethal interactions in the context of KRAS mutations could in
principle lead to the identification of novel genes critical for
KRAS activity. A number of studies have been published
recently describing such screens and potential drug targets.
In one of these studies, STK33, a poorly characterized kinase,
was identified as a candidate drug target for mutant KRAS
tumors (3). STK33 is a serine–threonine kinase that belongs to
the calcium/calmodulin–dependent family of kinases (4). The
physiologic function of STK33 is unknown and STK33 does not
seem to be genetically altered in cancers (3). However, downregulation of STK33 by RNA interference (RNAi) or inhibition
of its kinase activity by overexpression of a kinase dead (KD)
K145M STK33 protein conferred a lethal phenotype to mutant
KRAS cell lines (3). Suppression of STK33 expression by either
method resulted in the inhibition of p70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation but had no effect on the phosphorylation of AKT,
ERK1/2, or mTOR, suggesting that STK33 is downstream from
these nodes, but upstream from p70S6K.
Considering the attractiveness of targeting a kinase to treat
a well-defined patient population (KRAS mutated tumors), we
sought to confirm the findings in Scholl and colleagues (3),
and, in parallel, to identify small molecule inhibitors of STK33
kinase activity to further probe STK33 as a potential
therapeutic target. However, our results show that neither

STK33 Kinase Is Not Essential in KRAS-Dependent Cells

downregulation of STK33 by RNAi nor overexpression of
K145M STK33 affected the viability of mutant KRAS-dependent cell lines. Small molecule STK33 kinase inhibitors identified by high throughput screening did not inhibit cell
viability in a mutant KRAS-dependent manner. Together
our data suggest that STK33 inhibition does not block the
growth of KRAS-dependent cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection, the European Collection of Cell Cultures, or from
the German Resource Centre for Biological Material (DSMZ,
Germany) and were cultured for less than 6 months. We have
confirmed the KRAS status by sequencing in the following cell
lines: U937 (KRAS wild-type), PANC-1 (KRAS G12D), DLD-1
(KRAS G13D), NB4 (KRAS A18D), NOMO-1 (KRAS G13D), OCIAML3 (wild-type), and SKM-1 (KRAS K117N). The KRAS status
for all other cell lines was obtained from the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute Cancer Genome Project website. All cell lines
were cultured as recommended by the respective vendors and
all cell assays were done in serum-containing growth media
unless otherwise specified. Antibodies for Western blotting
were obtained from Abnova (STK33 clone 1F10), Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (KRAS, Actin), and Cell Signaling Technology
[P-p70S6K (T389), P-RPS6 (S235/236), and FLAG]. The siRNA
oligonucleotides were either commercially available or
custom synthesized and are described in Supplementary
Methods. Commercial sources of full-length, active STK33
proteins were from Millipore (catalog no. num; 14-671) and
Invitrogen (catalog no. PV4343). Full-length STK33 was also
produced at Amgen Inc. (see Supplementary Methods). The
LANCE Ultra Kinaselect Ser/Thr kit (PerkinElmer) was used to
identify STK33 substrates.
RNAi and overexpression of STK33
NOMO-1 and SKM-1 cells were transfected with siRNA
using Transductin (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), a
peptide-based delivery system. Cells were incubated with
peptide-siRNA complexes for 24 hours in growth media containing glycosaminoglycan-depleted FBS. Following incubation, cells were washed in growth media and replated (day 1)
for Western blotting and viability assays as described below.
HCT-116 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with siRNA
in duplicate 96-well plates using RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) with a final siRNA concentration of 30 nmol/L. RNA
expression levels were quantified from one of the two 96-well
plates 24 hours after transfection using the QuantiGene
branched DNA assay. Viability was quantified from the other
96-well plate 96 hours after transfection using CellTiterGlo
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
For DNA transfections, PANC-1 and DLD-1 cells were plated
at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates for viability assays or
300,000 cells per well in 6-well plates for Western blotting. The
following day, cells were transfected (day 0) with pcDNA3.1FLAG STK33 or pcDNA3.1-FLAG K145M STK33 or with the
empty vector as a control using FuGeneHD (Roche) according

www.aacrjournals.org

to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western blotting, siRNA or
DNA transfected cells were incubated in serum-free media
[Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA)] for 4 hours before harvest on day 3 after
transfection.
Quantification of RNA expression levels
RNA expression levels were determined using the QuantiGene branched DNA (bDNA) assay (Affymetrix) following the
manufacturer's instructions. The probe sets to detect STK33,
KRAS, and cyclophilin B RNA are described in Supplementary
Methods. Assays were carried out using cell lysates prepared
with 1X Quantigene Lysis Mixture (Affymetrix).
High throughput siRNA screens
High throughput screens of siRNA libraries were done in 27
solid tumor cell lines, including cell lines mutant for KRAS. A
cell viability assay using CellTiterGlo was done 96 or 120 hours
posttransfection. Detailed description of experimental procedures and statistics are found in the Supplementary Methods.
Kinase assays and small molecule library screen
Immunoprecipitation kinase assay. On day 3 posttransfection, DLD-1 cells were lysed on ice in Triton lysis buffer
containing fresh protease and phosphate inhibitors. FLAGSTK33 was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C in lysis
buffer using an anti-FLAG antibody prebound to Protein A/
G-Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After overnight incubation, the beads were washed extensively in Triton
lysis buffer, then with kinase buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4,
15 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.02% BSA). Following the
washes, a mixture of 50 mCi 33P g-ATP (PerkinElmer) and 10
mmol/L cold ATP was added to each IP to initiate the autophosphorylation reaction. After 90 minutes at 30 C the kinase
reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer
and the samples were run on 10% Tris/glycine gels, fixed, and
exposed to X-Ray film (Kodak).
To identify STK33 substrates, STK33 proteins from Millipore or Invitrogen were used with the LANCE Ultra Kinaselect
Ser/Thr kit in a lanthanide chelate excite (LANCE) timeresolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)
kinase assay. The kinase buffer contained 50 mmol/L HEPES
pH 7.0, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L DTT,
0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA, 20 nmol/L STK33, and 200 mmol/L
ATP as suggested by the manufacturer. STK33, substrate, and
buffer were mixed and the kinase reaction was carried out at
room temperature for 90 minutes. For detection of the phosphorylation signal, each reaction mix was incubated for 2
hours with the appropriate Eu-anti-phospho-peptide antibody. The LANCE signals were detected on a Rubystar instrument (BMG Labtech Inc.).
A high-throughput screen to identify STK33 inhibitors was
conducted using an optimized kinase assay (Km ATP 20 mmol/L)
against a small molecule library containing 410,432 compounds.
The compounds were tested at a concentration of 15 mmol/L.
The kinase reaction buffer contained 50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.0,
15 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA, 5
nmol/L STK33, 20 mmol/L ATP, and 50 mmol/L ULight-p70S6K

37 C. For the detection of the intracellular RPS6 phosphorylation, the AlphaScreen SureFire cellular kinase assay kit (pRPS6 S240/S244) and AlphaScreen protein A kit (PerkinElmer)
were used. The detection mix was composed of 40 parts
reaction buffer, 10 parts activation buffer, 1 part acceptor

room temperature for 3 hours. The detection buffer contained
125 pmol/L Eu-anti-p-p70S6K and 15 mmol/L EDTA, and the
reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. The
fluorescence signals were read on an EnVision plate reader
instrument (PerkinElmer). Follow-on 22-point dose–response
assays were used to determine the IC50 for the 1,043 most potent
STK33 inhibitors.

STK33 Kinase Is Not Essential in KRAS-Dependent Cells

achieved (Fig. 1A and C and Supplementary Fig. S1), no change
in the phosphorylation of p70S6K or RPS6 was detected
(Fig. 1A and C).
In parallel, cell viability was measured for 5 days following
transfection. Although KRAS knockdown in NOMO-1 and
SKM-1 cells was consistently associated with a decrease in
cell viability, STK33 knockdown had no detectable effect on the
viability of these cell lines (Fig. 1B and D). Our data therefore
suggest that downregulation of STK33 does not impede the
survival of the KRAS-dependent NOMO-1 and SKM-1 cell lines.
To extend these observations, high-throughput screens of
siRNA libraries were done in 27 solid tumor cell lines, including cell lines mutant for KRAS. SiRNAs directed at KRAS
significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) the viability of mutant KRAS
cell lines. However, siRNAs directed at STK33 showed no
significant effect on cell viability in any of the tested cell
lines, irrespective of their KRAS status (Fig. 2A and B). Knockdown of STK33 and KRAS RNA with the siRNAs used in the
high-throughput screens was verified in 2 KRAS mutant cell
lines (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Our data confirmed the
efficient knockdown of both genes, but also uncovered offtarget effects for 2 siRNAs, STK33_2Q and STK33_7Q, which
inhibited cell viability (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).
Overexpression of the kinase dead K145M STK33 has no
effect on the viability of mutant KRAS-dependent cell
lines
Another approach to study, the role of STK33 kinase activity
in mutant KRAS cell lines, consisted of overexpressing a kinase

A

dead version of STK33 in which the catalytic lysine is mutated
to a methione (K145M STK33). DLD-1 and PANC-1 cells were
chosen for these experiments because they carry a KRAS
mutation (G13D and G12D, respectively) and have been
reported to be dependent on KRAS and STK33 for proliferation and survival (3). STK33 protein levels are higher in DLD-1
cells compared with PANC-1 cells, but both cell lines have
similar levels of p70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4). In general, STK33 RNA and protein levels are
variable across cell lines and protein levels do not correlate
with the levels of p70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B).
To confirm that K145M STK33 has no catalytic activity,
FLAG-tagged wild-type or K145M STK33 were overexpressed
in DLD-1 cells by transient transfection, immunoprecipitated,
and incubated with 33P g-ATP. Weak autophosphorylation of
wild-type STK33 was observed following its overexpression,
consistent with published data (3, 5), but no autophosphorylation of K145M STK33 was observed (Fig. 3A). Endogenous
STK33 kinase activity was low in several cell lines tested,
suggesting that it is a weak kinase in cells (data not shown).
We also tested the purified recombinant K145M STK33 protein in a kinase assay with the p70S6K peptide as a substrate.
K145M STK33 was again confirmed to be inactive (Fig. 4B,
right). We then monitored the effect of overexpression of wildtype or K145M STK33 on the levels of p70S6K and RPS6
phosphorylation and on the viability of DLD-1 and PANC-1
cell lines. Overexpression of wild-type STK33 had no effect on
the levels of p70S6K or RPS6 phosphorylation or on the

peptides were potential substrates for the 2 separate sources
of STK33 (Fig. 4A). Full-length STK33 was then expressed
and purified by us in sufficient quantities to characterize its
enzyme kinetic parameters, to optimize kinase assay conditions, and to conduct a high-throughput small molecule
screen. During assay optimization, we found that the CREBtide peptide was phosphorylated in an STK33-independent
fashion (Fig. 4B, left; and data not shown). Unexpectedly,
CREBtide phosphorylation was detected after a kinase reaction in the presence of K145M STK33, suggesting the presence of some contaminant kinase in this preparation. On
the other hand, the phosphorylation of the p70S6K peptide
was closely linked to the levels of STK33 protein purity and
was absent from the K145M STK33 preparation (Fig. 4B,
right; and data not shown) suggesting that p70S6K is a more
selective substrate. We therefore screened a small molecule
library using an STK33 kinase assay with a p70S6K peptide as
a substrate. More than 400,000 small molecules were
screened at a concentration of 15 mmol/L. The hit rate
was 0.95% and the confirmation rate was 71%. The compound concentrations that inhibited the kinase activity by
50% (IC50) were determined for the 1,043 most potent hits.
We identified 6 molecules that inhibited STK33 kinase
activity with IC50s less than 10 nmol/L and 69 molecules
with IC50s less than 100 nmol/ (Table 1). Examples of IC50
curves are shown in Fig. 4C.

Discussion
KRAS mutations are an important driver of tumor growth.
In the past 15 years, the inhibition of driver mutations, such as
those found in several kinases including ABL, KIT, epidermal
growth factor receptor, and B-Raf, has resulted in important
clinical advances (6–10). However, targeting of other important driver genes such as KRAS has remained elusive. It has
long been recognized that blocking the deleterious effects of
KRAS mutations would likely be an effective approach to treat
cancers that carry KRAS mutations. Because KRAS itself has
been difficult to target, several groups have looked for alternative approaches to block KRAS function. Several potential
targets have been described recently, mostly through screens
for synthetic lethal interactions (3, 11, 12). We decided to focus
on one of these novel targets, STK33, because its kinase
activity was documented to be required for the survival of
KRAS-dependent cell lines.
This work describes 3 different methods used to study the
role of STK33 in cancer cell lines: RNAi, overexpression of
wild-type or K145M STK33, and small molecule STK33 kinase
inhibitors. In our hands, downregulation of STK33 expression
by RNAi had little effect on the survival of multiple mutant
KRAS cell lines. The lack of effect of STK33 knockdown on the

Small molecule STK33 kinase inhibitors do not
selectively inhibit the viability of KRAS-dependent
cell lines
The STK33 kinase inhibitors were used to determine
whether STK33 inhibition has any effect on the phosphorylation of p70S6K or RPS6 in cells. Our preliminary experiments
showed that the levels of p70S6K phosphorylation are very low
in many cell lines (Fig. 1A and C; Supplementary Fig. S4) and
are therefore not amenable for quantitative assays. We therefore decided to measure the levels of RPS6 phosphorylation
(pRPS6), a well known p70S6K substrate which is inhibited
when mutant KRAS is downregulated (Fig. 1A and C). The 510
most potent STK33 kinase inhibitors were tested for their
ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of RPS6 in 3 cell lines, 2
with mutant KRAS (NB4 and SKM-1) and 1 wild-type for KRAS
as a control (U-87 MG). Potent inhibition of RPS6 phosphorylation (<100 nmol/L) was observed in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 5A
and B and Supplementary Table S1) showing that these
compounds are cell permeable. However, our results showed
no correlation between the effect of the small molecules tested
on STK33 kinase activity in the biochemical assay and their
effect on the phosphorylation of RPS6 in any of the cell lines
tested (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Table S1).
Finally, the 145 most potent STK33 kinase inhibitors were
tested in 4 AML cell lines, 2 mutant (NB4 and SKM-1) and 2
wild-type (OCI-AML3 and U937) for KRAS, for their effects on
cell viability. First, our data showed no significant correlation
between the potency of the compounds on the STK33 kinase
activity and on cell viability (Fig. 6A–D; Supplementary
Table S2). Second, the effects observed were independent of
KRAS mutational status (Fig. 6A–E). Together, our data do not
support a synthetic lethal relationship between KRAS dependence and STK33.

survival in NOMO-1 and SKM-1 cell lines was consistent with
the lack of effect on 2 putative STK33 downstream signaling
proteins, p70S6K and RPS6, in these same cell lines. Our
results are in contrast to those of Scholl and colleagues,
who showed that knockdown of STK33 in these same cell
lines decreased both p70S6K phosphorylation and cell viability
(3). The reason for the discrepancy between the 2 studies is not

STK33 Kinase Is Not Essential in KRAS-Dependent Cells

likely due to a difference in cell lines. We have confirmed by
DNA sequencing that NOMO-1 and SKM-1 cells harbor KRAS
mutations (G13D and K117N, respectively). Moreover, KRAS
knockdown in these cell lines inhibits p70S6K and RPS6
phosphorylation and cell survival. On the other hand, it is
possible that differences in assay conditions could account for
the different results.
It is interesting to note that STK33 was a hit in a short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen to identify essential kinases in
293T cells, which are not KRAS dependent (13). On the other
hand, STK33 was not identified in another synthetic lethal
screen for KRAS dependency (12), or in our screens (Fig. 2).
Knockdown of KRAS in our screens readily identified KRASdependent cell lines (Fig. 2), showing the robustness of the
screens. False-negative results are not uncommon in si/shRNA
screens and may be due to the inability to efficiently downregulate certain genes in high-throughput experiments. Our
data confirmed the efficient knockdown of both STK33 and
KRAS (Supplementary Fig. 2A and C), but also suggested offtarget effects for 2 siRNAs, STK33_2Q and STK33_7Q, which
inhibited cell viability (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). The
off-target effects of STK33_7Q were not apparent in NOMO-1
and SKM-1 cells (Fig. 1A and C), but these findings illustrate
how false-positive results can easily occur. False positives are
not uncommon in si/shRNA screens because of the off-target
effects of both siRNAs and shRNAs and the methods used to
analyze the data (14). The algorithm used in our analysis is
designed to avoid false positives associated with single siRNAs
that give off-target effects. Our robust analysis method might
also account for the discordance between our data and those
previously published.
P70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation was not affected in
multiple cell lines despite efficient knockdown of STK33 and
efficient overexpression of a kinase dead STK33. Moreover,
across 510 small molecule STK33 kinase inhibitors, there
was no correlation between their effect on STK33 kinase
activity and their effect on the phosphorylation of RPS6 in
any of the cell lines tested. This is not due to a failure of the
assay because the most potent inhibitors of RPS6 phosphorylation across all 3 cell lines tested were potent PI3Ka/
mTOR inhibitors (data not shown). PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitors
are known to inhibit RPS6 phosphorylation (15). Together
these data suggest that p70S6K and RPS6 are not substrates
for STK33. During the course of our studies, we carried out
several experiments to identify additional STK33 substrates
without success. First, a ProtoArray of more than 9,000 fulllength proteins was screened using recombinant wild-type

versus K145M STK33 proteins, but no clear substrates were
identified (data not shown). It is interesting that a p70S6K
peptide that contains threonine 389, the same amino acid
whose phosphorylation was shown to be modulated by
STK33 downregulation by Scholl and colleagues (3), is a
substrate for STK33 in our biochemical enzyme assay.
However, the full-length p70S6K was not recognized by
STK33 in the ProtoArray or modulated by STK33 knockdown
in mutant KRAS cell lines in our studies. There are many
examples where peptides are substrates for kinases in vitro
even though the full-length protein is not a biological substrate. Second, lysates from wild-type or K145M STK33
overexpressing PANC-1 or 293T cells were used to probe
46 intracellular serine–threonine–tyrosine phosphosites. No
STK33-dependent phosphorylation events were observed in
either cell line (data not shown).
Finally, if STK33 kinase activity is important for the survival
of mutant KRAS cell lines, small molecule STK33 kinase
inhibitors would be expected to inhibit cell viability in a
mutant KRAS-dependent manner. The 145 inhibitors that
we tested inhibited cell viability with a range of potencies
that showed no statistical correlation with STK33 kinase
activity or KRAS dependency. The effects observed on cell
viability are likely due to inhibition of kinases other than
STK33.
In summary, our data show that STK33 kinase activity is not
essential for the survival of KRAS-dependent AML cell lines.
Further investigation will be necessary to define whether
kinase-independent functions of STK33 are important in
KRAS-dependent tumors. Moreover, identification of a direct
substrate for STK33 will be critical to determine the exact
relationship between the inhibition of STK33 kinase activity in
cancer cells and a functional outcome.
