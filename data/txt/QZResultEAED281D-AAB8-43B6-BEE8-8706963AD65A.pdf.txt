T

he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched
a national public education campaign designed to prevent
and reduce tobacco use among young people. The effort is aimed
at multicultural youth, a group that is typically difficult to reach
but frequently exposed to pro-tobacco images and messages.
The health burdens of tobacco use disproportionately affect
minority teens, particularly African American and Hispanic
youth, says Jonca Bull, MD, the FDA’s assistant commissioner
for minority health.
The “Fresh Empire” campaign targets adolescents and teens
aged 12 to 17 years, an age at which smoking experimentation
can easily lead to addiction. Tobacco use is almost always
initiated during adolescence, according to the FDA, with close
to 90% of established adult smokers having smoked their first
cigarette by age 18 years.
Using a variety of interactive marketing strategies,
including traditional paid media, multiple digital platforms,
and local outreach, the campaign associates living tobacco
free with a hip hop lifestyle. Television advertisements and

local events feature influential
members of the community
to communicate that message.
The advertisements first aired
nationally in conjunction with the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards
in October. The $128 million campaign, which is funded
by tobacco user fees, will run in approximately 36 markets
throughout the United States for at least 24 months.
Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco
Products, notes that “remaining in control” is an important
tenet of hip hop culture and smoking represents a lack of
control. The campaign reinforces its message by empowering
at-risk youth to live tobacco free, while also being authentic,
powerful, confident, fashionable, creative, and trendsetting.
“Fresh Empire” is part of the FDA’s general-market at-risk
youth education campaign, “The Real Cost,” which began in
February 2014. Both campaigns are evaluated to measure their
effectiveness in preventing and reducing youth smoking over time.

Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, PSA Screening Rates Decline

B

oth prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and prostate
cancer incidence have declined since the US Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) released revised screening
recommendations in 2012.1
In the first of 2 recently published studies on the topic,
Ahmedin Jemal, DVM, PhD, of the American Cancer Society,
and colleagues examined trends in stage-specific prostate cancer
incidence and PSA-based screening for men aged 50 years
and older subsequent to both the 2008 and 2012 USPSTF
recommendations.2 Prostate cancer incidence in men aged
75 years and older decreased substantially after the 2008
recommendation against PSA screening for this group.
Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
registries, the researchers determined incidence by stage of
disease from 2005 through 2012. The PSA screening rate was
determined by questionnaires completed by men aged 50 years
and older who responded to the 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013
National Health Interview Surveys.
Among their findings:
• Prostate cancer incidence per 100,000 men aged 50 years
and older was 535 in 2005, 541 in 2008, 505 in 2010,
and 416 in 2012. Rates began decreasing in 2008, with
the largest decrease occurring between 2011 and 2012.
• The number of men aged 50 years and older diagnosed with
prostate cancer nationwide declined by 33,519 individuals.
The decreases occurred across all regions and among both
non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black men.
• The percentage of men who reported having undergone
PSA screening within the past 12 months was 37% in
2005, 41% in 2008, 38% in 2010, and 31% in 2013.

Screening Prevalence Examined
In the second study, Jesse Sammon, DO, of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues
examined PSA screening data from National Health Interview
Surveys conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 to determine
the prevalence and determinants of screening before and after
the 2012 USPSTF recommendations, the draft of which was
released in October 2011.3
For their study population of 20,757 men, the findings
included:
• PSA screening prevalence was 34% in 2000 and 2005,
down from 36% overall between 2010 and 2013.
• PSA screening declined from 23% to 18% in men aged 50
to 54 years, and from 45% to 35% in men aged 60 to 64
years. No decline in screening was reported among men
aged 75 years and older.
The results indicate that younger men may be changing
their health care behavior at a higher rate than older men and/or
that changes in clinician PSA screening practices have occurred
as a result of the new USPSTF recommendations.
