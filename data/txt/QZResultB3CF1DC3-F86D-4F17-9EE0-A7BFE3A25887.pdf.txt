ABSTRACT
Purpose: Numerous studies have reported that glioma patients with isocitrate
dehydrogenase 1(IDH1) R132H mutation are sensitive to temozolomide treatment.
However, the mechanism of IDH1 mutations on the chemosensitivity of glioma
remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role and the potential mechanism
of Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug resistance.
Methods: Wild type IDH1 (R132H-WT) and mutant IDH1 (R132H) plasmids were
constructed. Stable U87 cells and U251 cells overexpressing IDH1 were generated.
Phenotypic differences between IDH1-WT and IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells
were evaluated using MTT, cell colony formation assay, scratch test assay and flow
cytometry. Expression of IDH1 and its associated targets, nuclear factor-erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), multidrug
resistant protein 1 (MRP1) and p53 were analyzed.
Results: The IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells were more sensitive to
temozolomide than WT and the control, and Nrf2 was significantly decreased
in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells. We found that knocking down Nrf2 could
decrease resistance to temozolomide. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in IDH1
R132H overexpressing cells was lower than the WT and the control groups after
temozolomide treatment. When compared with WT cells, NQO1 expression was
reduced in IDH1 R132H cells, especially after temozolomide treatment. P53 was
involved in the resistance mechanism of temozolomide mediated by Nrf2 and NQO1.
Conclusions: Nrf2 played an important role in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug
resistance. The present study provides new insight for glioma chemotherapy with
temozolomide.

INTRODUCTION

More importantly, as an anti-oxidant factor and p53
protector, NQO1 are implicated in the protection of
cells against oxidative stress and DNA damage [25, 26].
NQO1 is overexpressed in many cancers. Thus, a high
level of NQO1 is also associated with poor prognosis
[27, 28]. Moreover, NQO1 is a protector of p53 which
is involved in various DNA repair mechanisms. MRP1
is a member of the ATP-binding cassette super family,
and in association with the efflux of a broad range of
anionic compounds, it is the most intensely studied [29].
MRP1 was first identified in lung cancer tissue, but it is
also expressed in many other tissues including kidney,
lung, intestine and brain [23, 30, 31]. Overexpression
of MRP1 in cancer cells is related to chemotherapy
resistance and a poor prognosis [32].
Cells can resist variety of DNA lesions by a
series of DNA repairing machineries, and most of the
mechanisms are associated with p53. As an important
tumor suppressor, p53 protects the genome though a
variety of DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms
[33]. On the other hand, P53 can protect glioma cells
against DNA damage caused by TMZ.
In this study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in
IDH1 R132H-mediated drug resistance. Our results
showed that IDH1 R132H could significantly increase
chemosensitivity to TMZ in U87 and U251cells. We also
demonstrated that Nrf2 was involved in IDH1 R132Hmediated drug resistance. The role of Nrf2 in IDH1
R132H overexpressing cells provides new insight for
glioma treatment in the future.

Gliomas are the most malignant of primary
brain tumors [1], representing 70% of adult malignant
primary brain tumors with a yearly incidence about
0.06% [2]. Gliomas can widely infiltrate normal
brain tissue, making it difficult to resect the tumors
completely [3, 4]. Current conventional therapies for
glioma include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent which can
cause methylation on DNA bases in several positions,
resulting in DNA lesions and cell apoptosis [5]. Due
to its performance in blood brain barrier permeability
and its therapeutic effect, TMZ has become the first
choice of chemotherapy drugs for glioma treatment
[6]. However, resistance to radiation and TMZ
chemotherapy is an increasing problem in the treatment
of malignant glioma, greatly affecting the prognosis for
these patients.
In 2008, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase
1 and 2 (IDH1/2) were identified in more than 70% of
primary gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBM).
Patients with the IDH mutation are considered to have a
better prognosis than those with IDH wild-type (IDH1WT) tumors [7–9]. Especially, IDH1 accounted for the
largest proportion of IDH mutation cases; more than
90% of the mutations in IDH1 are classed as R132H
mutations [10, 11]. Other IDH1 mutations at Arg132 occur
at lower frequencies, including R132S and R132L [12].
Functionally, IDH1 catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate
to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and generates nicotine
adenine disphosphonucleotide (NADPH) in the cytoplasm
and peroxisomes [8]. In addition, IDH1 was involved in a
number of cellular functions including glucose sensing,
lipogenesis and regulation of cellular redox status [12, 13].
Numerous studies have reported that IDH1 mutation could
induce the decline of NADPH and cause reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation in cells [14, 15].
Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
is an important sensor of oxidation in cells; a Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) is the negative
regulator of Nrf2. Under normal conditions, the Nrf2
protein localizes in the cytoplasm with a low expression
level [16]. When cells are under stress, Nrf2 can
translocate into the nucleus in active form in order to
stimulate the expression of antioxidants, such as phase
II detoxification enzymes and other defensive proteins,
so as to maintain cell homeostasis [17]. The Nrf2
protein is highly expressed in many cancers, including
glioma, to contribute to chemo-resistance. Recent study
has also reported that Nrf2 was associated with the
prognosis of the glioma patients [18–21]. NAD(P)H
quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and multidrug
resistant protein 1 (MRP1) which are activated by
Nrf2 have been proven to be involved in chemical
resistance and anti-apoptotic mechanisms [22–24].

RESULTS
IDH1 R132H mutation significantly increases
chemosensitivity to TMZ
We evaluated phenotypic differences between
NC, IDH1-WT and IDH1 R132H overexpressing U87
cells and U251 cells using cell colony formation assay,
scratch test and MTT assay. In cell colony formation
assay and the scratch test, no significant differences
were observed for cell proliferation (Figure 1A) or cell
mobility (Figure 1B) among NC, WT and MT groups.
Next, we exposed the NC, IDH1-WT and IDH1 R132H
overexpressing cells to various concentrations of TMZ
for 72 h for evaluating their chemosensitivity. We were
surprised to find that NC and WT overexpressing U87
cells displayed strong chemical resistance to TMZ
in the MTT assay; the IC50 was over 400 μM. These
results were reproducible in U251 cells. However,
IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells were found to be
more sensitive to TMZ when compared with NC and
WT groups. Respectively, significant differences
were observed at 100 μM, 200 μM and 400 μM for
U87 cells and at 200 μM and 400 μM for U251 cells
(Figure 1C). The difference of chemosensitivity to

TMZ reached its maximized point at 400 μM in both
U87 cells and U251 cells. This optimal concentration
was applied in subsequent experiments. Furthermore,
flow cytometry analysis was used to confirm the
difference of cell apoptosis between IDH1 R132H
and other groups after being treated with 400 μM
TMZ. In both U87 (Figure 2A) and U251 cells (Figure
2B), the results of flow cytometry suggested that the
apoptosis rates in IDH1 R132H cells were higher

than NC and WT overexpressing cells, indicating that
IDH1 R132H mutation increases chemosensitivity
to TMZ.

level was decreased in IDH1 R132H overexpressing U87
cells (Figure 3A) and U251 cells (Figure 3B). In order
to confirm the correlation between Nrf2 and the chemoresistance to TMZ, two independent Nrf2-siRNAs were
utilized to reduce Nrf2 expression in U87 (Figure 3C
and 3D) and U251 cells (Figure 3E and 3F). The MTT
results showed that the chemosensitivity of NC and WT
overexpressing cells to TMZ was significantly enhanced
after Nrf2 reduction (Figure 3C-3F). Flow cytometry was

used to test the apoptosis rates change. After Nrf2 was
knocked down by siRNA-Nrf2 (1), the apoptosis rates of

by siRNA-Nrf2 (1) in NC and WT over-expression cells
(Figure 8B). After treated by 400 μM TMZ for 72 h, p53
was activated in NC, WT and MT groups. However, p53
levels in MT groups were still lower than other groups
(Figure 8C).

Subcellular localization of Nrf2 among NC, WT and
IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells was analyzed using
Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Cells were
treated with 400 μM TMZ for 2 h, 4 h and 8 h, followed by
nuclear protein extraction and Western blotting. Nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 was increased with the extension of
time and Nrf2 level in the cytoplasm was correspondingly
reduced. However, in both U87 and U251 cells, nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 was lower than that in NC and
WT overexpressing cells at the same time point of TMZ
treatment (Figure 5A and 5C). After TMZ treatment for
8 h, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in U87 and U251 cells
was observed with confocal microscopy. The Nrf2 protein
was stained with red fluorescence and the nucleus was costained with DAPI in blue. The results showed that Nrf2
fluorescence intensity in the nucleus was weaker than that
in NC and WT in both U87 cells and U251 cells (Figure
5B and 5D), indicating that nuclear translocation of Nrf2
was suppressed by IDH1 R132H.

DISCUSSION
Resistance to radiation and TMZ chemotherapy is
the main problem in the treatment of malignant glioma
and the prognosis for these patients. Numerous studies
have reported that patients with the IDH1 mutation
usually receive a better prognosis and have effective
TMZ treatment [1, 4, 36, 37]. However, the mechanism of
chemotherapy sensitivity in IDH1 mutation cells remained
to be understood. In this study, we investigated the role
of Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug resistance. We
first characterized the proliferation and mobility activity
conferred by the IDH1 R132H mutation. Our results
showed that IDH1 R132H could significantly increase
chemosensitivity to TMZ in U87 and U251 cells instead of
affecting cell proliferation and cell mobility. Cell apoptosis
rate in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells was higher than
that in WT cells after the treatment with 400 μM TMZ.
IDH1 is involved in energy metabolism. IDH1
dysfunction could induce energy metabolism disorders
and cause the accumulation of ROS in cells [38, 39].
Furthermore, many studies also reported that the ROS level
in IDH1 R132H cells was increased [15, 40]. Thus, the
relationship between the ROS disorder and chemotherapy
sensitivity in IDH1 R132H cells was concerned in the
past. Nrf2 is also an important antioxidant factor in cells.
Nrf2 and its downstream proteins were associated with
the chemical resistance of various cancers [22, 41, 42].
Kanamori et al. also reported that Nrf2 played an important
role in the prognosis of anaplastic glioma patients [42]. In
this work, we studied the relationship between ROS, Nrf2
and the chemosensitivity of IDH1 R132H. We found that
overexpression of IDH R132H could reduce Nrf2 levels
in U87 and U251 cells. This result could be supported by
siRNA silencing experiments, showing that the sensitivity
of cells to TMZ was significantly increased after Nrf2
silencing, suggesting that Nrf2 played an important role
in IDH1 R12H overexpressing glioma cells.
Nrf2 is generally located in the cytoplasm to bind
with Keap1 at nonfunctional status. It could translocate
into the nucleus and activate downstream proteins under
stress conditions. In the present study, both Western
blotting analysis and immunofluorescence analysis
showed that the translocation of Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H
overexpressing cells was significantly lower than that
in WT cells, especially after TMZ treatment. In order
to test whether ROS was related to the chemosensitivity
of TMZ in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells, we
measured the ROS levels. However, both in U87 and
U251 cells, ROS did not increase with the increasing

ROS level in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells
Compared with NC and WT, the ROS level in IDH1
R132H U87 cells was significantly increased in both the
negative and positive control groups, and the results were
reproducible in U251 cells (Figure 6A and 6C). However,
after treatment with various concentrations of TMZ for 72
h, IDH1 R132H overexpressing U87 and U251 cells did
not display a significant accumulation of ROS (Figure 6B
and 6D).

Nrf2, NQO1 and p53 are involved in IDH1
R132H-mediated drug resistance
In order to confirm whether these downstream
proteins are involved in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug
resistance, the expression level of these targets in U87
cells and U251 cells was measured using Western
blotting analysis. In both U87 and U251 cells, the basal
NQO1 level was significantly decreased in IDH1 R132H
overexpressing cells while MRP1 was comparable to the
NC and WT groups (Figure 7A). We further measured the
expression level of NQO1 and Nrf2 in cells after 400 μM
TMZ treatment. The results showed that both Nrf2 and
NQO1 could be activated by TMZ treatment with a lower
level in IDH1 R132H cells than that in NC and WT cells.
This indicated that Nrf2 and NQO1 are involved in IDH1
R132H-mediated drug resistance (Figure 7B and 7C). P53
is stabilized by NQO1 and directly involved in various
DNA repair pathways. We tested the p35 levels by western
blot and the results show that p53 was significantly
decreased in MT groups (Figure 8A). Levels of NQO1 and
p53 were decreased when Nrf2 expression was reduced

concentration of TMZ. Decreasing Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H
overexpressing cells did not promote the accumulation
of ROS caused by TMZ. Some studies reported that
TMZ could induce ROS accumulation in cells and
then cause DNA damage (36). However, most studies
suggested that the anti-cancer mechanism of TMZ was
mainly involved with forced methylation of DNA by
the active form of TMZ and MITC (5-(3-methylthree
nitrene-1-based)
imidazole-4-amide)
[43,
44].
Although ROS might be associated with the anti-tumor
mechanism of TMZ under certain conditions, ROS is
not an important factor involved in Nrf2-mediated
chemo-resistance in this study. Therefore, the chemical
resistance mechanisms of Nrf2 need to be further
identified, such as phase II detoxification enzymes and
other defensive proteins which are activated by Nrf2 and
related to chemical resistance.

NQO1 and MRP1 are both downstream proteins
of Nrf2 and play important roles in cancer chemotherapy
resistance [23]. Specifically, NQO1 can protect DNA
from alkylation damage [26]. MRP1 is a member of the
ATP-binding cassette super family that is associated with
the efflux of a broad range of anionic compounds. In this
study, the MRP1 level in IDH1 R132H overexpressing
cells was comparable to that of the NC and WT groups,
although the NQO1 protein level was significantly
decreased. We also measured the expression level of
NQO1 and Nrf2 in cells after 400 μM TMZ treatment.
The results showed that both Nrf2 and NQO1 could be
activated by TMZ treatment using lower levels in IDH1
R132H cells than that in NC or WT cells. Overall, these
results indicate that Nrf2 and NQO1 are related to IDH1
R132H-mediated drug resistance. However, TMZ can
cause DNA damage and induce tumor cells apoptosis.

Inoue et al reported that mutant IDH1 could alter DNA
repair and sensitivity to DNA damage [45]. Therefore, we
further study the DNA protection mechanism of NQO1.
P53 is an important protective factor involved in most of
DNA protection mechanism. As a genome protector, p53
can utilize a series of mechanisms against DNA damage
caused by TMZ. More importantly, p53 can be stabilized
by NQO1 [46]. In this study, we found that p53 was
significantly decreased in the MT groups and Nrf2 could

activate p53 expression through NQO1. Although p53 was
activated by TMZ, the level of p53 in MT groups was still
lower than other groups.
However, the regulatory mechanism between IDH1
mutation and Nrf2 remained unclear. As an important
energy metabolism enzyme, IDH1 mutation could cause
a series of disorders of energy metabolism. Thus, we
hypothesize that the metabolism change might affect
Nrf2 protein expression. Moreover, 23 miRNAs had been

levels in MT groups were still lower than those in other groups (C). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.

reported to be differentially expressed in IDH1 mutant
and IDH1 wild-type patients [47], and some of them are
involved in the regulation of Nrf2. Above all, regulatory
mechanisms between IDH1 and Nrf2 are complicated and
need more research to reveal their relationship.
At present, numerous studies are taking the IDH1
mutation as a therapeutic target [1, 48], and several
IDH inhibitors have been proved effective in vitro and
vivo [49, 50]. Targeted therapy for IDH1 mutation has
displayed great potential in cancer therapy. However, no
inhibitors have been reported that they can produce a
synergistic effect with temozolomide in the treatment
of glioma. Thus, the mechanism of IDH1 mutation
sensitivity to chemotherapy should be further researched
and people should provide new ideas to promote
IDH1 mutation inhibitors exploration and glioma
treatment.

days of transfection, transfected cells were selected and
enriched by applying 2 μM puromycin (Selleck, Shanghai,
China) in the culture medium for 24 h (un-transfected cells
were all apoptotic after 0.5~1 μM puromycin treatment
for 24 h). Then, the adherent cells continued passage.
When the cells fusion reached 80%, the cells were treated
with elevated concentrations of puromycin again. After 4
weeks, the cells could resist 4 μM puromycin treatment.
GFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy
to confirm that the stable cell lines have been established.
Flag protein expression was measured by employing
Western blot analysis to evaluate transfection efficiency.

Cell colony formation assay
U87 cells and U251 cells were seeded onto a 6-well
plate at a density of 50-60 cells per well. After 2 weeks,
cells were washed with PBS and subsequently fixed with 5
ml methanol for 20 min and stained with Giemsa staining
solution for 30 min. The stained cells were washed with
PBS and observed through a low power lens. A colony
with more than 50 cells was counted. The results were
expressed as a percentage of the NC group (NC lentivirus
vector over expression cells), which was set as 100%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Human malignant glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines,
U87 cells and U251 cells were purchased from the Shanghai
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Shanghai,
China). All these cell lines were cultured and maintained
in DMEM (Gibco-BRL, NY, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco-BRL NY, USA) and
incubated at 37°C with a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
Cells were passaged at 80% confluence.

Scratch test assay
Cell migration ability was assessed using the scratch
test assay. U251 cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate at a
density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured for 24 h. A linear
scratch was made with a 200-μl sterile pipette tip when
cell confluence reached 100%. Cells continued to grow
in serum-free DMEM for another 24 h, and scratched
wound healing was observed by microscope. The recovery
distance of the scratch was compared with the NC group
(NC lentivirus vector over expression cells).

Plasmid construction and lentivirus transfection
LV5 shuttle plasmid (Genepharma, Suzhou, China)
was employed as a lentivirus vector. IDH1 R132H
mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis,
referring to IDH1 wild type sequence (GenBank ID:
NM_005896). IDH1 R132H mutation was occur on the
132nd amino acid of the IDH1 gene, which was mutated
to histidine (CGT to CAT). The cDNA was fused in-frame
with a FLAG tag at the N-terminus using the following
synthesized primers: forwad primer with NotI site 5′-GA
TAGGCGGCCGCGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGA
CGACGATAAGTCCAAAA-3′, and reverse primer with
BamHI site 5′-CTATGGGATCCTTAAAGTTTGGCC

carrying IDH1 gene sequence was used as the negative
control (NC) lentivirus vector. U87 cells and U251 cells
were cultured in 35mm dishes. The culture medium was
replaced with fresh DMEM without FBS when cells were
at 80% confluence. Then 10 μL lentivirus solutions were
added to the medium and incubated for 24 h. After 3

MTT assay
Cell viability was determined by using MTT assay.
Briefly, cells were cultured on 96-well plates. After
being treated with TMZ at different concentrations for
72 h, MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to the cells and the
mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. MTT reagent was
then replaced with DMSO (100 μL per well) to dissolve
formazan crystals. After the shaking mixture at room
temperature for 10 mins, absorbance was determined at
570 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, USA). Cells
without TMZ treatment were used as the control group.
Results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance
of control cells, which was set as 100%.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate cell
apoptosis. Cells were treated with 400 μM TMZ for 72 h.
Cells without TMZ treatment were served as the control

group. Afterwards, cells were gathered and treated with
an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Keygen
Biotech). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS three
times and re-suspended in a 400 μl binding buffer, then
incubated with 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of PI
at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Finally, cell
apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry (Gallios,
Beckman-coulter, USA) within 1 h.

with 10% FBS, with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes.
Nrf2 primary antibody (1:50) was added onto coverslips
overnight at 4°C and then incubated with secondary
antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. Cell nuclei
were co-stained with 0.4% DAPI for 15 minutes. The
images were captured using a laser-scanning confocal
microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Image-Pro Plus software
was utilized to analyze the fluorescence intensity.

Knock down with siRNA

ROS analysis

Two siRNAs of Nrf2 were designed by Genepharma
(Suzhou, China) according to the Nrf2 sequence
(GenBank ID: NM_006164). The sequence of siRNA1 is
sense 5′-AGAUUUAFAUCAUUUGAA-3′, anti-sense
5′-UUUCAAAUGAUCUAAAUCUTG-3′. The sequence of
siRNA2 is sense 5′-ACAGUGUCUUAAUAUUGAATT-3′,
anti-sense
5′-UUCAAUAUUAAGACACUGUAA-3′.
The sequence of siRNA negative control (siRNA-NC)
is sense 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′, antisense 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′. U87and
U251 cells were cultured on 35mm dishes. SiRNAs were
transfected into cells using lipofectamine 3000 reagent
(Thermo, USA) when cells were at 80% confluence.

Cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were
used as the positive control; cells without H2O2 treatment
were used as the negative control. In the positive control
group, cells were treated with 300 μM H2O2 for 15
minutes. Cells expressing WT or MT IDH1 were cultured
on 96-well plates, then treated with TMZ for 72 h. The
medium was then replaced with DMEM, containing 10
μM dihydroethidium (DHE). The samples were detected
with high-content screening system [34, 35] (Thermo
Fisher) to calculate the fluorescence intensity, which can
reflect intracellular ROS levels.

Western blotting analysis

All experiments described in this study were
repeated at least three times. The data was presented as
the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses between the two
groups performed by unpaired Student’s t test. Differences
among groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Followed by ANOVA analyses, the Tukey
test was used. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Statistical analysis

Cells were cultured in 60mm or 35mm dishes.
Before protein extraction, cells were washed twice with
cold PBS, then suspended in 80 μL of RIPA lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitor. Protein concentration was
determined using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Pierce,
Rockford, USA). Nuclear extraction was separated
using a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit
(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). 20 μg of nuclear protein
was loaded in each lane and resolved using SDS-PAGE
gel electrophoresis followed by transfer onto a PVDF
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking
with 5% skimmed milk, the membrane was probed with
specific antibodies, including anti-histones H1 (1:1000,
Abcam, Shanghai, China), Nrf2 (1:500, Santa Cruz,
Dallas, USA), NQO1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA)
and MRP1 (1:1000, Novus Biologicals, NY, USA). β-actin
primary antibody (1:10000, Thermo, MA, USA) and
α-tublin primary antibody (1:3000, Thermo, MA, USA )
were used as the loading control. Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated rabbit and mouse secondary antibodies were
reacted with the membranes, respectively. Immunoblot
bands were detected by the enhanced chemoluminescence
technique. Image J software was utilized to quantify the
grey intensity.
