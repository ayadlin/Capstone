ABSTRACT
Improved efficacy of neoadjuvant endocrine-targeting therapies in luminal breast
carcinomas could be achieved with optimal use of pathway targeting agents. In a
mouse model of ductal breast carcinoma we identify a tumor regressive stromal
reaction that is induced by neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. This reparative reaction
is characterized by tumor neovascularization accompanied by infiltration of immune
cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts that stain for phosphorylated ribosomal
protein S6 (pS6), downstream the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. While tumor variants
with higher PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity respond well to a combination of endocrine
and PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, tumor variants with lower PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity
respond more poorly to the combination therapy than to the endocrine therapy alone,
associated with inhibition of stromal pS6 and the reparative reaction. In human breast
cancer xenografts we confirm that such differential sensitivity to therapy is primarily
determined by the level of PI3K/Akt/mTOR in tumor cells. We further show that the
clinical response of breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
is associated with the reparative stromal reaction. We conclude that tumor level and
localization of pS6 are associated with therapeutic response in breast cancer and
represent biomarkers to distinguish which tumors will benefit from the incorporation
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.

[3, 4]. Antiprogestins are being tested in clinical trials
as second or third line anti-endocrine therapies in
advanced or metastatic breast cancer settings, reviewed
in [5]. Among antiprogestins, mifepristone (MFP) has
shown considerable potential. MFP binds to PR, allows
dimerization of the receptor and subsequent binding to
DNA [6], but prevents recruitment of transcriptional
coactivators to target genes [7].
More than 50% of ER/PR-positive breast cancers
contain alterations in at least one component of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway, and these alterations drive cancer
growth and also facilitate development of resistance to
hormone prevention therapies [8, 9]. For these reasons,

INTRODUCTION
More than 70% of breast carcinomas are estrogen
receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive and
are thus potentially susceptible to anti-endocrine therapies.
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is increasingly used in
patients that share clinicopathological characteristics
such as: high ER and PR, low Ki67, HER-2 negative,
large tumor size, advanced age [1, 2] or presence of
comorbidities that preclude surgery. While estrogen
signaling is a key feature of breast cancer etiology,
experimental and epidemiological evidence has also
linked progesterone to breast cancer pathogenesis

therapeutic agents that target the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway have been actively pursued, with several agents
being tested in phase I to phase III studies in combination
with endocrine therapy [10–12]. Based on the BOLERO-2
trial in which the addition of everolimus (RAD001), an
mTOR inhibitor, improved progression free survival in
aromatase inhibitor resistant breast cancer, the US FDA
approved the use of everolimus in combination with
exemestane in patients with metastastic ER-positive breast
cancer refractory to aromatase inhibitors [13–17].
The tumor microenvironment comprises a hetero­
geneous population of cells including fibroblasts,
adipocytes, endothelial and immune cells, and the
extracellular matrix which serves as a scaffold and which
provides contextual information for the above-mentioned
cells [18]. Among these stromal cell types, cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) have been identified as important
promoters of tumor growth and progression [19], as players
in development of hormone independence [20], and as
potential therapeutic targets in highly desmoplastic human
cancers [21]. A number of studies have identified specific
elements of the tumor microenvironment that contribute
to tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and
metastasis [22, 23]. Moreover, differential gene expression
from breast tumor stroma can be used to identify gene
profiles associated with breast cancer outcomes [24].
However, the role of the tumor microenvironment in
therapeutic regression remains unknown.
We have used medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)induced mouse models of breast cancer [25] to define the
cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with tumor
regression following endocrine therapy that have allowed
us to identify key microenvironmental factors that can
modulate hormone dependency [26], response to endocrine
therapy, and to PI3K kinase inhibitors [27]. Here, we
show that endocrine therapy-induced tumor regression in
hormone-dependent mammary tumors requires a stromal
response that is dependent upon PI3K/Akt signaling.
Our findings have significance for effective therapeutic
targeting of this common breast cancer subtype.

to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin, than to endocrine inhibitors, while C4-HD
tumors are more responsive to endocrine inhibitors [27].
Overactivation of PI3K/Akt pathway by myristoylated Akt1
in estrogen- or MPA-dependent tumor cells induced ER and
PR activation and ligand-independent tumor growth affecting
endocrine therapy sensitivity [28]. Here we investigated the
role of the stroma in response to PI3K inhibition using this
tumor model. We found that 48 h treatment of C4-HI tumors
with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (WORT) significantly
enhanced the response to MFP, showing decreased tumor size
and cell proliferation, and increased necrosis, accompanied
by increased tumor stroma and tissue differentiation
(Figure 1A, 1B). The enhanced tumor regression was
associated with an increase in α-smooth-muscle actin
(αSMA)-positive CAFs and in CD31-positive endothelial
cells (Figure 1C). Moreover, while MFP treatment alone
increased levels of pS6, these were effectively inhibited in
mice treated with WORT (Figure 1D).
The additive effect of WORT and MFP was also
found on isolated C4-HI tumor cells growing on 3D
Matrigel (Supplementary Figure S1A). As with the
mouse transplantation experiments, the combination of
MFP+WORT had greater proapoptotic effect than either
MFP or WORT alone, as observed by phase microscopy,
and by acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/
BE) (Supplementary Figure S1B) and caspase 3 staining
(Supplementary Figure S1C). These results confirm that in
C4-HI tumors, the additive proapoptotic effect of WORT and
MFP that contribute to regression affects directly tumor cells.

Stromal activation of PI3K/Akt is associated
with tissue remodeling processes that drive
therapeutic response in hormone-dependent
mammary tumors
We next evaluated αSMA- and CD31-positive
stromal cells as biomarkers of tumor regression in
hormone-dependent tumors. C4-HD tumors require MPA
to grow [25] and regressed when the MPA pellet was
removed or after 48 h exposure to antiestrogens such as
tamoxifen citrate (TAM) or Fulvestrant (ICI182, 780; ICI),
although treatment with the antiprogestin MFP induced
larger tumor shrinkage (Figure 2A). While the tumor
parenchyma underwent cytostasis, apoptosis and
necrosis, the stromal tissue showed signs of expansion
and activation, and the stromal area reflected the
effectiveness of the antitumor treatments (Figure 2A–2C).
We detected proliferative and apoptotic cells next to the
regressive stroma, suggesting that different populations
of tumor cells coexist within the tumor parenchyma in
contact with the regressive stroma. With more effective
therapeutic response, activation of Akt (not shown) and
S6 (Figure 2D) became almost undetectable in residual
tumor parenchyma but was substantially increased in the
tumor stroma.

RESULTS
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt enhances endocrine
therapy-induced tumor regression in hormoneindependent mammary carcinomas
The MPA-induced mouse model of ductal ER/PRpositive breast carcinoma generates hormone-dependent
tumors that require MPA for growth (C4-HD); over time,
these tumors give rise to variants that can proliferate without
exogenous hormone supply and are thus designated as
hormone-independent (C4-HI) [25]. Both tumor types
are inhibited by the antiprogestin MFP, but differ in their
activation of PI3K/Akt pathway: C4-HI tumors display
higher levels of PI3K/Akt, lower PTEN, and higher response

To define the early events by which treatmentinduced stromal activation of S6 leads to tumor regression,
we assessed time-dependent response to MFP treatment
as it had induced the most powerful effect. The tumor
inhibitory effect (Figure 3A) was preceded by tissue
rearrangements, as assessed by histology (Figure 3B) and
immunostaining (Figure 3C). Cytostasis and apoptosis
became evident in the epithelial compartment after 6 h
of MFP (Figure 3A). The stromal reaction, including
increased stromal area (Figure 3A, 3B), increased number
of αSMA-positive CAFs (not shown), deposition of
collagen-I (not shown), and increased number of CD31
foci (Figure 3C), was evident after 12 h of administration
of MFP following a time-dependent manner. Labeling
of blood vessels with fluorescent lectins (Figure 3C)
confirmed that MFP induced functional new vessels.
Consistent with the results in Figure 2D, as
C4-HD tumor regression progressed in response to MFP,
the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was reduced in
C4-HD tumor parenchyma and increased in tumor stroma
(Figure 3D). Advancing CAFs are the stromal cells that stain
for pS6 shortly after MFP therapy. The increase in stromal
pS6-positive CAFswas time-dependent and elucidates the
changes on pAKT and pS6 levels detected by western blot
(Figure 3E). Thus, the increasing stromal component in MFPtreated tumors accounts for the increased overall pS6 levels.
We found that the rapid stromal reaction as assessed
by increased CAFs and vasculogenesis was accompanied by
immune cell infiltration. After 48 h of MFP administration,
the intratumor presence of macrophages (F480+) and
lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+ was confirmed (Figure
3F). We also observed Ki67-positive stromal cells in the
periphery and decreased Ki67 positivity in the center of
the tumor, suggesting proliferative activation of tumorassociated stromal cells and/or migration and invasion
of proliferative stromal cells from outside the tumor
(Figure 3G). Together, the results show that the stromal
reaction, hours after MFP administration, is associated with
an increase in neovascularization and tumor cell infiltration.
To evaluate PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation
in the regression of C4-HD tumors, we used the PI3K
inhibitor WORT alone or in combination with MFP for
48 h, finding that WORT interfered with MFP-induced
tumor reduction and tissue remodeling (Figure 4A).
At 12 h, WORT effectively inhibited the PI3K/Akt
pathway in both parenchymal and stromal compartments
as assessed by immunohistochemistry and western
blot (Figure 4B). Strikingly, the combination of MFP
and WORT reduced the apoptosis, tissue remodeling,
neovascularization and immune cell infiltration caused
by MFP (Figure 4C, 4D).
These results suggest that C4-HD tumor regression
induced by MFP requires stromal activation of PI3K/Akt
signaling and its inhibition interferes with the course of
tumor regression. Extending the observation to six days of
treatment revealed a sustained inhibition of MFP response
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

when combined with WORT (Figure 4E). Further evidence
that this was due to a requirement for PI3K/Akt signaling
was provided by the observation that similar effects were
found when the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA)
was combined with MFP (Figure 4E; Supplementary
Figure S2). Although MFP+RAPA still induced necrosis,
almost no stromal reaction was observed and reduction of
tumor size was shorter than with MFP alone.
To verify that tumor regression specifically requires
PI3K/Akt activation in the stroma, we evaluated the
response of these treatments on C4-HD tumor cells growing
on 3D Matrigel (Supplementary Figure S3A), finding again
that MFP was the most effective treatment for decreasing
Ki67 and increasing caspase 3 staining (Supplementary
Figure S3B, S3C). However, in isolated C4-HD cells,
WORT did not interfere with MFP-induced cytostasis or
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S3B, S3C). Thus, the
unfavorable effect of WORT on endocrine-induced C4-HD
tumor regression was not due to a direct effect on tumor
cells, but rather due to its effect on the tumor stroma itself.
These results demonstrate the existence of a critical stromadependent tumor regression mechanism that is suppressed
when PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited.

The level of PI3K/Akt pathway activation in
tumor cells determines the extent of stromal
reaction as well as cell viability in response to
therapy
Therapy-induced stromal pS6 was observed in C4HD (Figure 2D) but not in C4-HI (Figure 1D) tumors. To
determine the effect of intrinsic tumor heterogeneity on the
stroma-dependent tumor regression process, we evaluated
other variants of the MPA-induced model. In tumor
variants that show low levels of parenchymal pS6 when
grown as allografts (Figure 5A), MFP-induced tumor
reduction involves stromal remodeling, αSMA expression
and pS6 increase, and MFP-induced tumor regression
was impaired by WORT (Figure 5C). By contrast, in
tumor variants that display high levels of parenchymal
pS6 when grown as allografts (Figure 5B), MFP-induced
tumor reduction involves stromal remodeling with αSMA
expression, decreased parenchymal pS6, and little stromal
pS6. In this case, tumor regression was enhanced by the
combination of MFP and WORT (Figure 5C). These
results indicate that the differential response to MFP is
related to basal PI3K/Akt and pS6 levels rather than to
MPA-dependent status.
To assess the dependence of the stromal response
on endocrine targeting tumor reduction in human breast
cancer cell models, we employed T47D and IBH-6 cells
expressing vector only (Acl4) or expressing an activated
variant of Akt1 (myristoylated Akt1, myrAkt1) (Figure 6A).
We used RAPA to overcome the constitutive activation of
Akt1 due to the myrAkt1 plasmid. In proliferation assays
using the IBH-6 cell series, the antiestrogen ICI showed

a stronger inhibition of proliferation than RAPA in vector
control cells, whereas RAPA was more effective than ICI
in Akt1-expressing cells (Figure 6B). We have previously
shown that MFP inhibits T47D wild type xenograft growth
[29, 30]. Here we found that orthotopic xenografts of T47DAcl4 cells showed significant therapeutic response to MFP
or MFP+RAPA but not to RAPA itself (Figure 6C), while
xenografts of T47D-myrAkt1 cells were strongly inhibited
by RAPA alone or RAPA combined with MFP, but not
with MFP alone (Figure 6D). In T47D-Acl4 tumors, MFP
induced strong tissue remodeling and neovascularization
associated with tumor shrinkage (Figure 6C). By contrast,
in T47D-myrAkt1 tumors, RAPA was required for induction
of necrosis and tumor shrinkage (Figure 6D), while MFP did
not induce tissue remodeling. As expected, pS6 levels were
higher in T47D-myrAkt1 (Figure 6D) than in T47D-Acl4
tumors (Figure 6C) and were severely diminished by RAPA.
Finally, pS6-positive CAFs were induced by MFP in T47DAcl4 but not in T47D-myrAkt1 tumors (Figure 6C, 6D).

Together, our findings demonstrate that activation of
S6 in tumor cells is prognostic of therapeutic response in
diverse models of breast cancer and represents a potential
biomarker to distinguish for which tumors combination of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors with anti-endocrine therapies
would be beneficial, and for which they could have the
potential to be detrimental.

Correlation between stromal pS6 and αSMA
suggests a modulatory effect of PI3K/Akt
pathway in the therapeutic response of human
breast cancer
To assess how these pathways impact human
breast cancer treatment response, we evaluated breast
tumor samples from a set of 24 women who received
neoadjuvant endocrine therapy at the Mayo Clinic (cohort
characteristics in Table 1). We analyzed the type and
grade of stromal reaction in the post-treatment samples,

assessing collagen-I (not shown), αSMA, CD31, and pS6
score in the parenchyma and in the stroma (Figure 7A). To
evaluate the therapeutic response, we compared tumor size
before starting therapy and immediately before surgery.
The clinical response to treatment correlated significantly
with stromal αSMA (Figure 7B). We also found that while
αSMA, pS6 and CD31 were associated in areas where
the stroma increased and the tumor regressed (Figure 7A
inserts), CD31 levels were not significantly correlated with
αSMA or pS6 scores in the overall sample. Strikingly,

stromal but not parenchymal pS6 correlated significantly
with αSMA (Figure 7B) and in quiescent or fibrotic stroma
pS6 was low or absent (Figure 7A). Furthermore, actively
regressive tumor areas showed that αSMA, pS6 and CD31
were mainly localized in the advancing stroma (Figure 7A
inserts). While these results are somewhat limited by
considerations of sample size and heterogeneity of patient
treatment regimens, our findings are supportive of our
model that tumor regressive processes in humans also
involve stromal PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation.

DISCUSSION

In another set of 18 human samples naïve of any
treatment (cohort characteristics described in Table 2),
αSMA was present in fibroblasts, myoepithelial cells
and vascular structures (Figure 7C). Epithelial neoplastic
cells showed pS6-positive staining in 13 of 18 samples
(65%), but pS6 was totally absent in the stroma in these
samples. These findings support our model that stromal
pS6 discriminates, at an early stage of treatment, which
subset of patients has activated PI3K/Akt pathway and
could therefore benefit from an anti-endocrine/anti-PI3K/
Akt combination therapy.

Here we defined a novel role of the stromal reaction
in breast tumor regression after anti-endocrine therapy.
We found that stromal expression of pS6 may represent
a biomarker for the benefit of incorporating PI3K/Akt/
mTOR inhibitors into neoadjuvant endocrine therapies.
Using mouse models of ER/PR-positive breast carcinomas,
orthotopic xenografts of T47D human breast cancer cells,
and clinical samples from breast cancer patients undergoing
neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, we found that the intrinsic

patients was distributed for the graph in terms of tumor reduction with the arbitrary cut off of 30% and analyzed as a whole for correlation
between the three parameters. Stromal αSMA correlated significantly with stromal pS6 score (p = 0.039, Spearman Rho) and with the % of
tumor reduction (p = 0.036, Spearman Rho). C. H&E and IHC for αSMA and pS6 in tumor areas of one representative non-treated patient,

tumor heterogeneity for PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation as
assessed by S6 protein phosphorylation is associated with
therapeutic response. Stromal pS6 is present exclusively
after therapy and is absent in non-treated tumors or in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endocrine-treated tumors with a poor reactive stroma. We
suspect that the presence of pS6 in stromal or in parenchymal
compartments after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is related
to particular mechanisms involved in tumor regression. Thus,

evaluation of parenchymal and stromal expression of pS6
early in treatment may identify which patients would benefit
from combining PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with neoadjuvant
endocrine therapies, and more critically, for which patients
this combination would be potentially detrimental. Future
studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis and its
possible relevance for selecting patients for PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway-targeting drugs in clinical practice.
In both pre-clinical and clinical settings, we found
that the stromal reaction associated with activation of
αSMA and deposition of collagen-I is linked to better
therapeutic outcomes. We further found that in the mouse
model, MFP-induced formation of functional new vessels
relates to tumor cell infiltration of pS6-positive CAFs and
immune cells, likely representing a crucial role of stromal
pS6 in the remodeling and healing processes that take
place during early stages of tumor regression. Previous
reports have suggested that human breast CAFs can
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

directly promote angiogenesis through the expression of
stromal cell-derived factors [31] and that CAFs promoted
macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and tumor
growth in a mouse model of squamous skin carcinogenesis
[32]. We speculate that mesenchymal fibroblasts could
be the key cell type responsible for the tumor regressive
stromal reaction, but further studies are necessary to fully
evaluate this hypothesis. We found that in tumor variants
in which there is low intrinsic tumor level of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR relative to that found in the stroma, blockage of
pS6 activation through the use of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
interferes with MFP-induced neovascularization, immune
cell infiltration and tumor regression. However, in tumor
variants with a high intrinsic tumor level of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR, MFP as a single agent did not induce tumor
regression, and its combination with PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors is required to induce a therapeutic response.
Since in human samples we found that actively regressive
22092

tumor areas of advancing stroma stained positive for
αSMA, pS6 and CD31, our results in the mouse model
could provide mechanistic insight into how stromal pS6
activation occurs and how it contributes to breast tumor
regression after endocrine therapy.
Variations in breast cancer-associated stromal
histology have been described from predominantly cellular
(fibroblasts/myofibroblasts) to fibrillar (dense collagenous
stroma) subtypes [33]. Such stromal variations are associated
with differential paracrine activation by growth factors
and cytokines. Recent studies have evaluated variations
in tumor stroma as a predictor of outcome in breast
cancer patients [34], finding that a higher ratio of tumor to
stroma is associated with recurrence and poorer long-term
survival. Another recent study evaluating tumor stroma
after endocrine therapy in breast cancer [35] found that
molecular differences between invasive lobular cancer (ILC)
and infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDCs) are maintained
following endocrine treatment. It is becoming clear that
detailed analyses of tumor parenchyma and stroma, as well
as their interactions will be required to develop therapies
that target the tumor microenvironment [21, 36–40]. In this
context, our results have particular relevance by providing
insight into stromal biomarkers of antitumor efficacy that
are evident soon after treatment begins, which is lacking
in current therapeutic protocols. The parameters that we
identified here (αSMA and pS6) are easily quantified by
pathological examination using normal clinical procedures.
While endocrine therapies can be initially effective
for ER/PR breast cancer patients, acquired or de novo
resistance and subsequent recurrence remain significant
clinical problems. Pre-clinical in vivo studies have recently
been developed [41, 42] and an improved understanding
of the interaction of endocrine and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
inhibitors in neoadjuvant settings is necessary to break
down the heterogeneity in responses to target therapy as
reported in the clinic [13]. We assessed model systems
and human breast tumor samples to dissect how stromal
activation of PI3K/Akt affects response to endocrine
therapies. Our findings demonstrate that activation level
of S6 in tumor cells is prognostic of therapeutic response
and could be relevant to explore the involvement of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR targeting therapy to avoid or delay hormone
independence and consequently endocrine resistance. The
molecular mechanisms that contribute to tumor regression
after therapy, conferring the response of the tumor cells
to MFP and the induction of S6 phosphorylation in the
stromal cells, remain to be defined. The authors speculate
that these mechanisms relate more with a wound healing
process than to tumor growth events. Further experiments
are being performed to examine the molecular interactions
between tumor cells and stromal cells during tumor
regression after therapy. Also, longer-term studies will
be necessary to determine if the more effective methods
for inducing tumor regression identified in our study also
confer reduced rates of tumor relapse.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

It has been proposed that tumors with mutations at
the catalytic p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA mutations)
that may confer activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway are more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
[43], although the prognostic value of PIK3CA mutations
in ER-positive breast cancer is still controversial
[44–47]. The effect of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors has yet
to be validated through reliable biomarkers of efficacy
[48]. Phosphorylated S6 and its kinase p70S6K also have
been proposed to predict tamoxifen resistance [49]. The
striking finding in our pre-clinical models, supported by
our results with human breast cancer biopsies, is that
pS6 is highly expressed in invading and reactive stroma
after therapy. It has been reported that stromal pS6
increased in the fibroblasts embedded within the tumors
in Caveolin-1 knock out mice [50] and the authors related
that finding with angiogenesis and with breast tumor
hormone-independent growth. The authors also reported
these effects can be reduced by RAPA and suggested the
involvement of the stromal mTOR pathway on blood
vessel formation and tumor growth in Caveolin-1–
deficient tumors. Strikingly, here we propose that the
proliferative stroma with activated mTOR signaling could
also be a good prognostic indicator of the tumor regressive
process in a particular tumor context. Then, pS6 is a
potential early biomarker that could predict better clinical
outcome after endocrine therapy in those tumors with a
high percentage of stained stromal cells. On the basis of
the results present here, we speculate that tumor level and
localization of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation before
neo/adjuvant therapy can be used to predict which patients
will benefit with a combination therapy with PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors and which patients will not. For those in the
latter category, it may be that endocrine therapy only
should be recommended.
An increase in microvasculature and tumor infiltration
by MFP was recently reported in other MPA-induced tumors
as well as in T47D xenografts [30]. Our results are consistent
with those reported by Nakasone et al., who found that the
microenvironment contributes critically to the response
to chemotherapy via regulation of vascular permeability
and immune cell infiltration [51]. Furthermore, we show
here that WORT interferes or potentiates the MFP-induced
neovasculature in C4-HD or C4-HI tumors, respectively. This
dual effect of PI3K in angiogenesis was already observed
both in normal tissues and in cancers [52, 53]. Furthermore,
it has been reported in mice that inhibition of PI3K could
normalize vascular structure and increased perfusion of breast
tumors improving delivery of doxorubicin [54]. Even though
the mechanisms by how the stromal activation interact with
endocrine therapies remains to be demonstrated, we speculate
that in some type of tumors pS6 stromal activation could
drive stromal reaction involving angiogenesis that contributes
to tumor infiltration of immune cells and also to tumor
shrinkage through improvement of drug delivery. Further
studies will be necessary to assess this possibility.

A limitation of the MPA-induced murine model used
here is that it is a progesterone-driven model. However,
endocrine sensitivity or resistance coexists for both
antiprogestins and antiestrogens [25], supporting the use
of this model as appropriate for studying ER/PR-positive
disease. Another limitation of our study is that we used
ER/PR-positive T47D cells that have oncogenic mutations
in PIK3CA [55]. Nevertheless, introduction of myrAkt1
construct in T47D cells still increases PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway. Referring to human samples, different endocrine
therapies have been used in the cohort of 24 patients
available for this study. Considering that each therapy
could have different mechanisms of actions and resistance,
a more comprehensive study that include patients from
multiple clinical centers could provide a more complete
assessment. Furthermore, studies considering clinical,
histopathological and molecular parameters should be
done in biopsies before and after treatment to validate the
potential role of pS6 in the prediction of therapy efficacy.

IBH-6 [28, 57] and T47D (ATCC) human breast
cancer cells were stably transfected with an empty Acl4
retroviral vector, or a myristoylated human Akt1-Δ4–129
(myrAkt1) construct, as described in [28]. Cell counting
and xenograft implantation were previously described
[29, 30], for more details see Supplementary Material 2.

Human breast cancer tissue samples
Human samples were obtained from a tissue bank
with no selection criteria. The study on treated samples
was limitated to the number of available samples of
breast carcinomas that had been treated with neoadjuvant
endocrine therapy and undergone surgical resection at
Mayo Clinic. Written informed consents were received
from participants prior to inclusion in the study and
are available in Mayo Clinic and CORI Cancer Center.
Confidentiality was preserved for the investigators in a
codified form. Mayo Clinic provided approval for this
research through its Institutional Review Board. The
IByME Ethics Committee approved the study with CORI
Cancer Center.

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that the stromal reaction
accompanied by αSMA increase that occurs early in tumor
regression resembles a healing process that is indicative
of overall therapeutic response. We find that stromal
and parenchymal phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6
(pS6) downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway constitutes
potential biomarkers of targeting therapy efficiency.
Moreover, we show that PI3K/mTOR inhibition in
combination with endocrine targeting therapies represent
a useful approach only in tumors that have high levels of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR in the parenchymal compartment. The
current challenge will be to evaluate the generalizability of
pS6 levels and localization as biomarkers to design, guide
and monitor treatment strategies for breast cancer patients.
