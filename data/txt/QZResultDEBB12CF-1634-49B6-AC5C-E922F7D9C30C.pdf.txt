Abstract
Interleukin (IL)-15 effects on CD8 T and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes hold promise to treat cancer. Fusion
proteins have been engineered to provide IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) mediated trans-presentation to
lymphocytes and extend the plasma half-life of the cytokine. In this study, we report on a triple fusion protein
combining apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I), IL-15, and IL-15Ra's sushi domain. Apo A-I conveys IL-15 to high-density
lipoproteins (HDL), from which the cytokine is trans-presented by the IL-15Ra's sushi domain. Such a
construction was tested by hydrodynamic gene transfer to the liver of mice. Lethal toxicity was observed upon
injection of 10 mg of the expression plasmid. Mice died from an acute lymphocytic pneumonitis in which T and
NK cells dominate a severe inﬂammatory inﬁltrate. Importantly, mice devoid of NK cells were not susceptible
to such toxicity and mice lacking granzymes A and B also survived the otherwise lethal gene transfer. Lower
plasmid doses (<2.5 mg) were tolerated and dramatically increased the numbers of NK and memory CD8
T lymphocytes in the liver, spleen, and lungs, to the point of rescuing the deﬁciency of such lymphocyte
subsets in IL-15Ra/ mice. Doses of plasmid within the therapeutic window successfully treated metastatic
tumor models, including B16OVA lung metastasis of melanoma and MC38 colon cancer liver metastasis.
Sushi-IL-15-Apo as a recombinant protein was also bioactive in vivo, became conjugated to HDL, and displayed
immunotherapeutic effects against metastatic disease. Cancer Res; 73(1); 139–49. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Interleukin(IL)-15 is a cytokine that has shown promising
antitumor effects in preclinical studies (1), and clinical
trials are currently ongoing (NCT01385423, NCT01369888,
NCT01021059, and NCT01572493). The main mechanisms of
actions against cancer are based on eliciting or favoring
proliferation and activation of both natural killer (NK) and
memory CD8 T cells (2). IL-15 is naturally expressed on the
membrane of dendritic cells tethered to IL-15 receptor
alpha (IL-15Ra). This cytokine-receptor complex triggers

on cell-to-cell contacting lymphocytes, the heterodimeric
receptor formed by the subunits IL-2Rb and the common gc
(3). Activity on the IL-2Rb/gc complex is a property shared
by IL-2 and IL-15. In marked contrast to IL-2, IL-15 seems to
be a better tool for cancer immunotherapy, as IL-15 does not
promote activation-induced cell death and does not induce
proliferation of T regulatory cells (4).
One of the limitations of IL-15 to exert an efﬁcacious
antitumor effect is the short plasma half-life of the protein
(5). For this reason, various approaches to increase its stability
have been undertaken. Gene therapy with viral vectors (6), cells
engineered to secrete IL-15 (7), and fusion proteins linking
IL-15 to another larger protein fragment are among the possibilities to increase molecular weight and redirect the IL-15
to a speciﬁc target (8). As mentioned, it has been shown that
IL-15 naturally acts as a trans-presented cytokine bound to the
extracellular region of the IL-15Ra (to a domain called sushi).
Complexes of IL-15 and the sushi domain of the IL-15Ra
or fusion proteins containing both agents (9) have been used
to strengthen its antitumor effect as a result of mimicking
to some extent the naturally occurring trans-presentation
mechanism (10).
Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) is the main protein component
of the high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that circulate collecting
cholesterol from tissues and bringing it to the liver (11). Apo
A-I is an amphiphilic protein, naturally synthesized in the liver
and which has been already used to stabilize IFN-a and target
it to the liver (12).

Ochoa et al.

In a previous study, we constructed a plasmid coding for
Apo A-I protein fused to hIL-15 (pApo-IL-15; Ochoa and
colleagues, submitted for publication). This expression plasmid was transferred to the liver by hydrodynamic injection,
thereby obtaining a high and sustained concentration of the
protein in serum and a clear effect on the proliferation of
NK and CD8 T cells. When the liver transference was conducted in combination with a separate plasmid coding for
the sushi domain of IL-15Ra (pSushi), the effect on NK and
T cell proliferation was enhanced and certain antitumor
effects were attained albeit to a modest extent.
In the current study, we have designed and tested a triple
fusion protein encompassing the sushi domain of the IL-15Ra,
IL-15, and Apo A-I.

Materials and Methods
Mice and cell lines
C57BL/6 mice (6–10-weeks old) were purchased from
Harlan Laboratories. Rag1/, Rag2/IL-2Rg /, and
IL-15Ra/ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. GzmAxB/ and perfxgzmAxB/ mice (C57Bl/6 background) were kindly provided by Dr. Julian Pardo (University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain). They are homozygous
triple knockout for granzymes A and B and perforin. They
were originally created by crossing perf/ with gzmAxB/
mice (13). These mice were maintained under pathogenfree conditions in the animal facilities of CITA (Agrifood
Research and Technology Centre of Aragon) in Zaragoza,
Spain. Mouse genotypes were periodically tested by PCR as
previously described (13). B16OVA melanoma-derived cells
were B16F10 cells transfected to express chicken ovalbumin
(OVA) and have been described previously (14). MC38 is a
colon adenocarcinoma cell line of C57BL/6 origin (15).
B16OVA and MC38 cell lines were validated by Idexx Radill
in 2012 (February) using a panel of microsatellite markers
for genotyping.
Cell lines were maintained at 37 C in 5% CO2 and were
grown in RPMI medium (RPMI-1640) with GlutaMax (Gibco,
Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma–
Aldrich), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin (Biowhittaker), and 50 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco). CTLL2 is a stable subclone of cytotoxic T lymphocytes originally
isolated from a C57BL/6 mouse and 200 U/mL of IL-2 (Preprotech) was added in its culture medium (16). Peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were obtained from ﬁlters of
blood donation units under informed consent following
approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee, carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) stained and monitored as
described (17). Details on the isolation of mononuclear cells
from spleen, lung, and liver, as well as antibodies, ﬂow cytometry, and immunoshistochemistry can be found in Supplementary Methods.
Plasmids
For sushi domain construction (pSushi), kindly provided
by Dr. Bulfone-Paus (Research Center Borstel, Borstel,
Germany), complete mIL-15Ra was cloned into the BamHI

140

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

and NotI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The Cterminal part was removed by PCR (Uprim. TAAAGAGGGCCCTATTCTATAGTG and Lprim. GGGGTCTCTGATGCACTTGAG) and subsequent ligation of the product.
Apo A-I plasmid cloning (pApo) were designed using, the
sense primer (FwATGmApoAI) 50 -ATGAAAGCTGTGGTGCTGGC-30 and the antisense primer 50 -TCACTGGGCAGTCAGAGTCT-30 (RvTGAmApoAI). It was ampliﬁed by PCR on liver
total cDNA and puriﬁed from an agarose gel with a QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Puriﬁed cDNA was cloned in the
expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad; ref. 12).
For Apo A-I and human IL-15 (pApo-IL-15) plasmid
construction, a PCR ampliﬁcation was carried out using
the sense primer FwATGmApoA1 on pApo as a template,
and the antisense primer RvAscImApoA1 (50 -GGCGCGCCCTGGGCAGTCAGAGTCTCGC-30 ), introducing the restriction site for the AscI enzyme (GGCGCGCCC) in 30 end of
Apo A-I gene, eliminating the stop codon and including a
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) peptide as linker of the 2
codiﬁed proteins. mApoA-I-AscI–puriﬁed cDNA was cloned
in the expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA (Invitrogen). Human IL-15 sequence was cloned in the expression
vector pTrcHis2 TOPO TA (Invitrogen) using 50 AATAATGGCGCGCCGAACTGGATAGATG-30 (FwAscIhIL-15) and 30
GCGGCCGCTCAGGACGTGTTGATGAAC-50 (RvNotIhIL-15)
primers that introduced a restriction site for AscI enzyme
in 50 and NotI in 30 . pTrcHis2-hIL-15 was digested with AscI
and NotI and the AscI-hIL-15-NotI DNA fragment (345 nt)
was obtained. To carry out the gene fusion, plasmid pCMVmApoA1-AscI was digested with the AscI/NotI enzymes
(New England Biolabs). The ligation was conducted with
the open plasmid pCMV-mApoA1-AscI and the AscI-hIL-15NotI insert in an 1:3 (vector:insert) ratio using T4 DNA ligase
High Concentration and 2 Rapid Ligation Buffer (Promega). The resulting 6669-nucleotide plasmid will hereinafter be called pApo-IL-15. All plasmids were conﬁrmed by
sequencing. In our hands, there are no differences of mouse
and human IL-15 on functional data with CTLL2 cells (data
not shown).
To fuse mSushi-mIL-15 with ApoA-I, PCR ampliﬁcation
was carried out using the primers (Fw 50 -ATGGAGACAGACACCCTGCTG-30 ) and (Rv 50 -GGGCGCGCCGCTGGTGTTGATGAACAT-30 ) on pSushi-IL-15 (kindly donated by Dr.
Bulfone-Paus) as a template. The antisense primer introduces the restriction site for the AscI enzyme in 30 end of
mSushi-mIL-15 gene and eliminates the stop codon. The
resulting puriﬁed DNA product was cloned into the
pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen),
obtaining the plasmid pCMV-mSushi-mIL-15-AscI. To carry out the gene fusion, plasmids pCMV-AscI-mApoAI (12)
and pCMV-mSushi-mIL-15-AscI were digested independently with the AscI/NcoI enzymes (New England Biolabs).
The open plasmid pCMV-mSushi-mIL-15-AscI and the
-AscI-mApoAI insert were ligated in a 1:3 (vector:insert)
ratio using T4 DNA ligase High Concentration and 2
Rapid Ligation Buffer (Promega). The resulting plasmid
will hereinafter be called pSushi-IL-15-Apo.

HDL Carrying an IL-15 Fusion Protein

Hydrodynamic injections
The plasmids were transferred by an intravenous injection
(tail vein) of plasmid in a volume of 100 mL/kg using a 27-G
needle at a rate of 0.4 mL/s, as previously described (18).
In vivo tumor growth
For the intrasplenic tumor model, C57BL/6 mice received
an injection of MC38 cells in the surgically exposed spleen
(5  105 per mouse). On day 1 or 4, mice were treated with
the corresponding plasmid by hydrodynamic injection. These
mice were sacriﬁced after 19 days and tumor nodules in spleen
and liver surface metastasis were counted and measured.
For the B16OVA-derived lung tumors model, C57BL/6 mice
received an intravenous injection of B16OVA cells (5  105
per mouse). On day 1, mice were treated with the plasmids
or 50 mg of the Sushi-Apo-IL-15 protein. The mice were
sacriﬁced on day 14 and tumor nodules in lung surface were
counted and measured.
rSushi-IL-15-Apo, electrophoresis, and Ponceau staining
Recombinant Sushi-IL-15-Apo protein with 6HIS tag was
produced by Genscript.
To visualize the purity of rIL-15-Sushi-Apo, 10 mg were
separated in 4% to 20% TrisHEPES PAGE LongLife iGels
(Nusep) gradient gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Whatman). Total protein was visualized by Ponceau staining.
Sushi-IL-15-Apo bioactivity assay
CTLL2 cells were washed 3 times with PBS and cells in RPMI
medium was plated in a 96-well plate (104 cells per well in 50
mL). Recombinant mIL-15 or Sushi-IL-15-Apo proteins were
added at the described concentrations. The plates were then
incubated for 2 days and subsequently, the microcultures were
pulsed with 0.5 mCi of tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) 8 hours
before being harvested. Cells were harvested using a Micro
Beta Filter Mate-96 harvester (PerkinElmer) and [3H]TdR
incorporation to the nuclei adsorbed onto the ﬁlters was
measured using an automated Topcount liquid scintillation
counter (Packard).
pSTAT-5 detection after culture with rSushi-IL-15-Apo
Splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice were isolated and incubated 30
minutes at 37 C in RPMI medium and 0.5 mg/mL of IL-15 or
rSushi-IL-15-Apo. Then, the cells were ﬁxed with an equal
volume of 37 C prewarmed BD Cytoﬁx Buffer (BD Biosciences)
during 15 minutes. Cells were then permeabilized with BD
Phosﬂow perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes in
ice-cold solution and were stained with the different antibodies
and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

Results
Liver gene-transfer of pSushi-IL-15-Apo induces a lethal
toxic effect due to inﬂammatory inﬁltrates of NK and CD8
T lymphocytes in the lung
The pSushi-IL-15-Apo expression plasmid was administered by hydrodynamic injection to C57BL/6 mice. Injection

of 10 mg of expression plasmid resulted in the onset respiratory distress as early as 48 to 72 hours later and in
the death of 100% of the mice within 3 to 4 days after the
hydrodynamic injection procedure (Fig. 1A). To ascertain
the cause of death, mice were euthanized when the respiratory distress was clearly observed by inspection (day 3
after gene transfer), and following euthanasia a thorough
necropsy examination was conducted. Lungs seemed
congestive and erythematous. Lung histologic staining
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and a-CD3 monoclonal
antibody (mAb) immunohistochemistry was carried out
(Fig. 1B). An abundant inﬂammatory inﬁltrate was observed in the lungs of mice treated with 10 mg of pSushiIL-15-Apo. Such an inﬁltrate was reduced when the plasmid
dose was 1 mg. Moreover, ﬂow-cytometry analysis of the
lung lymphocyte inﬁltrates showed high amount of NK and
NKT cells retrieved from the lungs of mice treated with 10
mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo. The inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in
those mice treated with 1 mg of the expression plasmid
were clearly of more modest intensity (Fig. 1C). The quantity of CD8þ CD44þ T cells in the lungs was similar in mice
treated with 10 mg or 1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo.
Next, experiments in gene-modiﬁed mice were undertaken
to identify the mechanisms involved in toxicity. 10 mg of
pSushi-IL-15-Apo were transferred to the liver of wild-type
(WT), Rag 1/ and Rag2/gc/ mice. Only Rag2/gc/
mice lacking both T and NK cells survived longer than 5 days
(Fig. 2A) and made a full recovery. To explore the requirement
for NK cells, WT and Rag 1/ mice were depleted of NK cells
with anti-asialo GM1 (Wako), or alternatively, were depleted of
NK and NKT cells with a-NK1.1 mAb. When such mice received
10 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo, the construction was not lethal for
those mice whose NK cells had been depleted with a-asialo
GM1 (Fig. 2B). In the group of Rag 1/ mice that received
a-NK1.1 mAb, there was a residual lethality but it was reduced
to 60%.
The molecular requirements of the NK effectors for the
observed lethal effects were explored in subsequent experiments. Hydrodynamic gene transfer of 10 mg of pSushi-IL15-Apo to mice knocked out for the genes of granzymes A
and B did not cause overt toxicity (Fig. 2C). This also was
true in perforin, granzymes A and B triple knockout mice.
These data clearly indicate that the lethal toxicity of the
pSushi-IL-15-Apo is due to the cytotoxic granule machinery of the NK cells. Additional candidates as possible
mediators of the toxicity were explored injecting the
plasmid to knockout mice for the following genes: IFNg, IFN-a receptor, the receptor of the Apo A-I (SR-BI), and
Apo A-I (Supplementary Fig. S1). There were no differences
in the survival of those mice and WT mice, suggesting that
none of those molecules and pathways played a key role in
the toxic effect. We also neutralized TNF-a with a TNF-RFc chimera without any noticeable change in the acute
toxicity proﬁle. Two main conclusions were drawn: (i) the
novel construct had a likely on-target side effect causing an
acute NK cell pneumonitis; and (ii) such an undesired
effect was dose-dependent, thus offering a potential therapeutic window.

A tolerable dose of pSushi-IL-15-Apo induces an increase
in the number of NK and CD8 T cells
The dose of 1 mg of expression plasmid transferred by
hydrodynamic injection to the liver was tolerated without
any signs of distress. The follow-up of the serum concentration of the protein was analyzed by a commercial ELISA for
mIL-15. The administration of 1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo
yielded a signiﬁcantly lower concentration of Sushi-ApoIL-15 protein at 24 hours than those obtained with 2.5 or
10 mg of plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To study in a
bioassay that Sushi-IL-15-Apo was bioactive, CTLL2 cells
(that need IL-2 or IL-15 to proliferate) were incubated with
sera from mice that had received a hydrodynamic injection of
1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo. Sera from these mice induced

proliferation in CTLL2 cells, as measured by [3H]TdR incorporation (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Moreover, the different lipid fractions of the serum were
fractionated by ultracentrifugation and the fraction containing the HDL was tested in the cultures of CTLL2 (Supplementary Fig. S2C), showing that at least a part of the functional
triple fusion protein becomes complexed to HDL. These data
were conﬁrmed by immunoblotting, as a clear band of the
corresponding shifted molecular weight for the triple fusion
was detected with an anti-Apo A-I antibody (Supplementary
Fig. S2D).
Our results do not offer evidence for clear superiority of
pSushi-IL-15-Apo over pSushi-IL-15. Nonetheless, if mice are
hydrodynamically injected with these expression constructs,

the 48-hour serum samples from these animals exerts proliferative bioactivity on CTLL2 cells when tested in multiple
serial dilutions (Supplementary Fig. S2D). This suggests that
the Sushi-IL-15-Apo transgene is more bioactive in this treatment setting.
The hydrodynamic injection of 1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo
increased the number of lymphocytes in spleen, liver, and lung
6 days after the plasmid injection. The number of NK cells
(NK1.1þCD3) was much higher in mice treated with 1 mg of
pSushi-IL-15-Apo than in control mice that received pApo and
similar to those mice that received a hydrodynamic injection
with 10 mg of pApo-IL-15 and pSushi in separate plasmids. In
contrast, the number of CD8þCD44þ T cells was clearly higher
in mice with the pSushi-IL-15-Apo treatment than in mice
injected with both pApo-IL-15 and pSushi as separate expression constructs (Fig. 3A).

A separate study on the kinetics of these effects showed that
the increases in the number of NK and CD8þCD44þ T cells in
spleen, liver, and lung of mice treated with the triple construction peak around day 7 postinjection and then progressively
declines to reach normal values at day 15 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In contrast, the administration of the pApo-IL-15 and
the pSushi in separate plasmids showed different kinetics,
with the highest increase of NK and CD8 lymphocytes around
day 4. Lymphocyte proliferation was observed in vivo by
BrdUrd incorporation. Lymphocytes in mice transferred with
pSushi-IL-15-Apo showed a more intense proliferation than
mice that received pApo or separate pApoIL-15 þ pSushi
constructions (Supplementary Fig. S4).

cells and have a severe reduction in memory-phenotype CD8
T cells (19). Hydrodynamic injection of 1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo

pSushi-IL-15-Apo transferred to the liver at a tolerated
dose exerts antitumor effects against metastatic tumors
The antitumor effect of the tolerable dose (1 mg) of pSushiIL-15-Apo was studied in a model of B16OVA spread to the
lungs following intravenous inoculation of the tumor cells.
In a ﬁrst pool of experiments, we observed that the group of
mice treated with 1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo the following day
of tumor cell administration had less lung metastases than

at day 14 (Fig. 4A). A photograph of 3 representative excised
lungs of each group is shown in Fig. 4B. Next, an experiment
was carried out treating the mice at day 4 after intravenous
tumor inoculation and the number of lung metastases in the
group of mice treated with pSushi-IL-15-Apo at day 4 was
clearly lower than in the control group and similar to the group
that received the treatment the day following the tumor
injection (Fig. 4C).
To study the antitumor effector lymphocytes in this
setting, an experiment was carried out in Rag1/ and WT
mice depleted of CD8b or NK1.1þ cells (Fig. 4D). In mice

without NK cells, the tumors grew faster than in WT without treatment and in those depleted of CD8þ T cells the
treatment was not effective, suggesting that the antitumor
effect is mediated by the interplay of both NK and CD8
T cells.
Next, the antitumor therapeutic effects were tested in a
model of MC38-derived liver metastases. The colorectal
carcinoma cells were injected in the spleen, in which a
primary tumor grew and then metastatic tumors disseminated into the liver. Mice were treated with the different
expression plasmids 1 day after undergoing intrasplenic
inoculation of the colon carcinoma cells. Nineteen days
later, the livers were harvested and the metastases on the
surface of this organ were counted. Mice that had received
1 mg of pSushi-IL-15-Apo were 100% metastasis-free in the
liver (Fig. 5A). In addition, the spleens were examined and
weighed to reﬂect the primary tumor size (Fig. 5B). Fifty
percent of mice from the group treated with pSushi-IL-15Apo did not present any macroscopic tumor in the spleen,
whereas 100% of mice from the saline group had spleen
tumors, 67% from the pApo group, and 100% of the pApoIL15 þ pSushi group.

Sushi-IL-15-Apo recombinant protein administered
intravenously is bioactive and elicits antitumor effects
Clinical feasibility of this treatment would beneﬁt from
using a recombinant protein as the therapeutic agent
instead of conducting cumbersome gene therapy procedures. The recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia
coli and puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography. SDS-PAGE
and Ponceau staining were carried out to analyze the purity
and integrity of the protein (Fig. 6A). In addition, the
bioactivity of the protein was studied with a CTLL2 proliferation bioassay (Fig. 6B), and such bioactivity was also
checked in terms of an assay to detect STAT-5 phosphorilation in primary lymphocytes. For the latter purpose, splenocytes were incubated overnight with recombinant IL-15
or rSushi-Apo-IL-15 and then intracellular pSTAT-5 was
studied by ﬂow cytometry in T and NK cells. As can be
seen in Fig. 6C, rSushi-IL-15-Apo induced pSTAT-5 phosphorilation in NK and memory-phenotype CD8 T cells.
Moreover, intravenous injection of rSushi-Apo-IL-15 produced dose-dependent increases in the number of NK and
memory CD8 T lymphocytes in the spleen, liver, and lung
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Figure 5. pSushi-IL-15-Apo hydrodynamic gene transfer is active against liver metastases of MC38 colon carcinoma. A, mice were injected with 5  10
MC38 colon cancer cells on day 0 inside the surgically exposed spleen. On day 1, mice received hydrodynamic gene transfer of the indicated plasmid
or plasmid combinations. Excised livers were inspected on day þ19 and the number of metastases on the surface of hepatic lobes was counted.
Statistic comparisons were made with one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni corrections;   , P < 0.001. B, the ratio of spleen weight to total weight
of the mouse to reﬂect the size of the splenic tumor. In the pSushi-IL-15-Apo group 4 of 8 mice were tumor-free in the spleen.

To ascertain if this fusion protein was active on human
lymphocytes, CFSE-labeled PBMC from healthy volunteers
were injected into the peritoneal cavity of Rag2/IL-2Rg /
mice. Such mice were intravenously treated with 50 mg of
recombinant Sushi-IL-15-Apo or saline. As can be seen in
Fig. 6D, gated human NK and CD8 T cells retrieved 6 days
later from the peritoneum had proliferated in response to the
injected fusion protein. This is consistent with previous studies
using IL-15 forms engineered to be transpresented (20).
The antitumor activity of the recombinant protein rSushiIL-15-Apo was tested in the B16OVA lung metastasis
model. Tumor progression in mice that received 50 mg of
rSushi-IL-15-Apo intravenously on day þ1 was similar to
that observed in mice in which 1 mg of the pSushi-IL-15-Apo
construction was transferred to the liver by hydrodynamic
injection 1 day after tumor cell inoculation (Fig. 7). ELISA
assays conducted following each type of treatment showed
that the serum concentrations achieved by 1 mg hydrodynamic injection that are in the range of 200 to 300 pg/mL
following injection of the plasmid are also observed around
30 minutes after intravenous injection of 50 mg of the triple
fusion protein (data not shown). Both groups treated with
Sushi-IL-15-Apo, as gene therapy or recombinant protein,
presented less metastatic foci in the lungs than the nontreated control group.

Discussion
We have analyzed the immune and antitumor effects of
liver gene transfer of a construction coding for the sushi
domain of IL-15Ra, IL-15, and Apo A-I. We have shown that
the liver gene transfer of the triple fusion is highly toxic at
any dose higher than 2.5 mg of plasmid per mouse, mainly

146

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

due to the accumulation of NK cells in the lungs. Such a
lethal inﬂammatory effect is dependent on granzymes A and
B and perforin. Toxic effects related to IL-15 have been
described in transgenic mice that continuously produce
IL-15 (21). Those mice die from NK or T leukemias when
12- to 30-weeks old. Other transgenic strains of mice that
express human IL-15 also develop leukemia when they are
older than 12 months (22). However, to our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst time that an acute lethal toxic effect is described
following IL-15 treatment, giving an idea about the potency
of the chimeric construction that we report.
We had previously studied Apo-IL-15 noncovalently linked
to IL-15Ra and it is clear that both biologic effects and toxicity
are much less pronounced. This is interpreted in the sense that
covalent bounds enforce IL-15 trans-presentation by the
IL-15Ra sushi domain (2). Accordingly, this triple fusion
cytokine represents a highly active form of IL-15. The Apo
A-I that forms part of the HDLs conceivably acts as a natural
vehicle that facilitates the IL-15/IL-15Ra sushi domain anchorage for trans-presentation. Another advantage of Apo A-I is
that this protein has been reported to exert some not wellunderstood antitumor properties (23).
For clinical translation, our observations on acute toxicity
might look worrisome. However, it must be taken into account
that because of using gene therapy, we are clearly overdosing
the cytokine. In a sense, ﬁnding a maximal-tolerated dose
suggests that our construct is making the most of the IL-15
system. This is important for translation as IL-15 enjoys
the reputation of a great potential in immunotherapy (24)
with a very safe preclinical proﬁle.
The activity observed with the recombinant protein is a
step forward toward clinical translation. In the case of this
construct, exogenous administration of protein at reliably

controlled levels is probably safer. The only advantage of the
gene therapy approach used for the proof-of-concept experimentation is that the liver is the natural bioreactor of HDLs
in the organism. Indeed, the approach with recombinant
proteins is the most feasible for translation. Other groups
have used linked forms of IL-15Ra to IL-15 (9) with biologic
effects on lymphocytes as well as with therapeutic effects on
transplanted tumors (10). It is early to decide without comparative studies which of these fusion proteins will offer the
best and safest pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
but incorporation into lipoproteins may have advantages.
The effectiveness of therapy is particularly remarkable
against B16OVA-derived metastasis even when given 4 days
after tumor cell inoculation. This observation on efﬁcacy
against lung tumors could be related to the propensity of NK

www.aacrjournals.org

cells and CD8 T lymphocytes to inﬁltrate the lung under
these therapeutic conditions. In this regard, toxicity is considered an on-target side effect for which a therapeutic window
was found. Human malignancies progress more slowly than
mouse-transplanted tumors. Therefore, we tested if doses
can be repeated to weeks apart in mice, and we found that
the increases in NK and CD8 memory T cells were comparable
or even higher 4 days after the second hydrodynamic treatment. Accordingly, repeated doses seem to be feasible
without desensitization or cumulative toxicity (Supplementary
Fig. S6).
Apo A-I–linked cytokines may add interesting immunotherapeutic properties (12). In this case, Sushi-IL-15-Apo holds
promise for metastatic disease and deserves clinical development. We eagerly expect results for the ﬁrst human trials of
