Abstract
Triptolide is a bioactive ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that exhibits diverse biologic properties,
including anticancer properties. Among its many putative targets, this compound has been reported to bind to
XPB, the largest subunit of general transcription factor TFIIH, and to cause degradation of the largest subunit
Rpb1 of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In this study, we clarify multiple important questions concerning the
signiﬁcance and basis for triptolide action at this core target. Triptolide decreased Rpb1 levels in cancer cells in a
manner that was correlated tightly with its cytotoxic activity. Compound exposure blocked RNAPII at promoters
and decreased chromatin-bound RNAPII, both upstream and within all genes that were examined, also leading to
Ser-5 hyperphosphorylation and increased ubiqutination within the Rbp1 carboxy-terminal domain. Notably,
cotreatment with inhibitors of the proteasome or the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK7 inhibitors abolished the
ability of triptolide to ablate Rpb1. Together, our results show that triptolide triggers a CDK7-mediated
degradation of RNAPII that may offer an explanation to many of its therapeutic properties, including its robust
and promising anticancer properties. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5363–73. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Triptolide is a principal bioactive ingredient of Tripterygium
wilfordii Hook F, which has been used to treat autoimmune
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis in China (1). In addition to its unique
structure of a diterpenoid triepoxide, triptolide has aroused
extensive research interests due to the following pharmacologic characteristics. Triptolide possesses multiple apparently
unrelated activities, including anti-inﬂammatory, immunosuppressive, antifertility, anticystogenesis, and anticancer
activities (1), which seem to suggest multiple molecular
mechanisms involved in those activities. Moreover, according

to a comparative analysis using the NCI-60 internal database,
the GI50 proﬁle of triptolide is signiﬁcantly different from those
of 118 reference anticancer compounds (2), suggesting that
triptolide could have anticancer mechanisms and molecular
targets potentially distinct from those of other anticancer
agents. Consistent with its various activities, triptolide has
been revealed to interact with several cellular proteins, including polycystin-2 (PC-2), disintegrin and metalloprotease 10
(ADAM10), dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1), and XPB (1).
These proteins with distinct functions have thus been identiﬁed as its potential primary targets. And possibly, more
potential targets would be added to the list in future because
using the known targets of triptolide cannot fully explain its
activities. Triptolide inhibits RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)–
dependent transcription, showing a distinct mode of action
from those of other known transcriptional inhibitors, including 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenz-imidazole (DRB)
and ﬂavopiridol (CDK9 inhibitors), actinomycin D (a DNA
binder), and a-amanitin (an RNAPII inhibitor; refs. 2–5).
Triptolide is thus considered to be a new type of transcriptional inhibitors (4).
The effect of triptolide on transcription has been paid special
attention in recent years because this effect seems to contribute in most of its biologic activities, in particular, anticancer,
anti-inﬂammatory, and immunosuppressive activities (1).
Triptolide affects mRNA transcription in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Treatment with triptolide at low
concentrations and/or short exposure largely inhibits the
transcription of short-lived mRNA, and possibly as a compensatory response, increases the transcription of some other

5363

Manzo et al.

genes such as p53. In contrast, its high concentrations and
persistent exposure could reduce 80% mRNA transcription (2).
Two factors, XPB inhibition and RNAPII degradation induced
by triptolide, have been proposed to be responsible for its
transcriptional inhibition (1, 6). XPB, a subunit of the general
transcription factor TFIIH, is involved in both RNAPIImediated transcription initiation and DNA nucleotide excision
repair (NER; ref. 7). Triptolide directly binds to XPB, inhibits its
ATPase activity and consequently, represses RNAPII transcription initiation and NER (4, 6). The previous reports revealed
that inhibition of both XPB activity and mRNA transcription
required only low concentrations of and/or short exposure to
triptolide but induction of RNAPII degradation needed relatively high concentrations of and/or long exposure to the drug
(2, 4, 6). Those data seem to suggest that RNAPII degradation
induced by triptolide could contribute to its transcriptional
inhibition at a relatively later stage but to a relatively more
severe degree than XPB inhibition. Therefore, clarifying the
molecular mechanism(s) of RNAPII degradation induced by
triptolide would be critical to fully understand its transcriptional inhibition.
Degradation of RNAPII often follows ubiquitination of its
largest subunit, Rpb1 (8–10). Ubiquitination can occur at
different sites, both on the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD;
ref. 11) and other residues (12), which depends on the type of
transcriptional stress or stalling. The CTD consists of multiple
repeats of the consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7, plays a
fundamental role in regulating the RNAPII-mediated transcription, and the stability of Rpb1 (8, 13, 14). Phosphorylation
at Ser-5 and Ser-2 of the CTD regulates transcription initiation
and elongation, respectively, at speciﬁc steps (14, 15). Ser-5
phosphorylation is mainly catalyzed by cyclin-dependent
kinase 7 (Cdk7), a subunit of the general transcription factor
TFIIH, which occurs in early phases of transcription initiation
and allows promoter clearance of RNAPII. In contrast, Ser-2 is
mainly phosphorylated by the positive transcriptional elongation factor (PTEF-b; the CDK9/cyclin T1 complex), which
promotes transcriptional elongation (14). On the basis of the
inconsistent data from different experimental approaches in
the previous reports (8, 10, 16–18), however, whether phosphorylation of the CTD is correlated with ubiquitination and
RNAPII degradation remains controversial and has to be
clariﬁed.
In terms of triptolide, particularly, although Rpb1 degradation by this agent has been consistently reported, whether it
elicits phosphorylation of the CTD also seems controversial (3,
4, 6). In addition, although the inability to recruit TFIIH has
been shown to induce RNAPII stalling at promoters (19, 20),
whether triptolide could induce an RNAPII stalling at active
promoter regions remains to be established. Moreover, XPB
inhibition by triptolide is known to suppress transcription
initiation (4) and as known, only a fraction of the total RNAPII
binds to template DNA and engages in transcription (10).
However, whether triptolide-induced Rpb1 degradation affects
the chromatin-bound RNAPII is yet to be investigated.
Our current study was designed to answer those open
questions. Following validation of the triptolide-induced Rpb1
degradation, our results revealed that this agent elicited

5364

Cancer Res; 72(20) October 15, 2012

hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 at Ser-5 of the CTD via CDK7,
which contributed to its RNAPII degradation. We further found
that the chromatin-bound reduction of Rpb1 at promoters was
subsequent to a block of RNAPII at promoter-proximal sites of
transcribed genes. Our data also showed that the Rpb1 degradation was associated with the cell-killing potency of triptolide, indicating the biologic importance of the triptolidedriven, CDK7-mediated Rpb1 degradation.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Triptolide, used in our experiments, was prepared from
Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F as described previously (21).
MG132, epoxomicin, cycloheximide (CHX), DRB, and H-7 were
purchased from Sigma. Triptolide (10 mmol/L), MG132 (10
mmol/L), epoxomicin (10 mmol/L), CHX (50 mg/mL), and DRB
(50 mmol/L) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) as
stock solutions, respectively; H-7 (50 mmol/L) was dissolved in
ethanol. The stock solutions were kept in aliquot at 20 C
(triptolide, epoxomicin, CHX, DRB, and H-7) or at 80 C
(MG132) and thawed immediately before each experiment.
RPB1 (CTD repeat), phospho-Ser-2-RPB1, phospho-Ser-5RPB1, and ubiquitin antibodies were from Abcam, CDK7, and
b-actin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, RPB1
(H-224) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and
GAPDH antibody was from Beyotime.
Cells and culture conditions
Human cancer cell lines MKN-45 (gastric), A431 (epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (cervical), A549 (lung), DU145 (prostate), HepG2 and BEL-7402 (liver), SK-OV-3 (ovarian), A375
(malignant melanoma), and HCC1937 and MCF-7 (breast)
were obtained from the cell bank of the Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, PR
China). Human cancer cell lines PC-3 (prostate), 786-O (kidney), and MDA-MB-436 (breast) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. PC-3 cells were authenticated
with the Promega Cell ID System by BMR-Genomics. Beijing
Microread Gene Technology Co, Ltd. used short tandem repeat
proﬁling to authenticate all other cell lines. All the cells were
also periodically authenticated by morphologic inspection and
tested Mycoplasma contamination. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium; A431, HeLa, HepG2,
SK-OV-3, A375, and MCF-7), F12 (A549 and PC-3), L-15
(MDA-MB-436), or RPMI-1640 (DU145, BEL-7402, MKN-45,
786-O, and HCC1937) medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Growth inhibition assays
The growth inhibition of triptolide was examined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays as described previously (21). Brieﬂy,
cells in 96-well plates were treated in triplicate with gradient
concentrations of triptolide at 37 C for the indicated time, and
then assessed with SRB (Sigma). The absorbance at 560 nm was
detected with a plate reader (SpectraMax; Molecular Devices).
The survival rate was calculated as (A560 treated/A560 control)

siRNA transfection
PC-3 cells were plated at 18,000 cells/cm2 density. Transfection was conducted 24 hours after the plating with the RNAiMax transfection reagent and 20 nmol/L of scramble siRNA or
CDK7 siRNA (Invitrogen). CDK7 silencing testing and triptolide treatments were conducted 72 hours after transfection.
Western blotting analyses
Cells were lysed in 1  SDS lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and
10% glycerol] and then boiled for 10 minutes. Western blotting
analyses were conducted as previously described using appropriate antibodies and the levels of cellular proteins were
visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies
(Dingguo) using an ECL Plus Kit from Amersham Biosciences.
Reverse transcription-PCR analyses
Cells were treated with triptolide for the indicated time.
Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was
reverse transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase
and cDNA was used for PCR with the following primers

and extension at 72 C for 1 minute. The products were
analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by
ethidium bromide staining.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
Chromatin preparation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) procedures have been described previously (22, 23).
In brief, cells were ﬁxed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15
minutes at 20 C, and chromatin was sonicated to an average
DNA fragment size of 300 to 400 bp. Chromatin was equilibrated in RIPA buffer, and samples were precleared with
nonimmune IgG. Equal amounts of precleared chromatin were
then incubated with speciﬁc antibodies against the ﬁrst 224
amino acids of the N-terminal domain of the largest subunit of
RNAPII or preimmune IgG (to measure background recovery).
Immunoprecipitated DNA was puriﬁed after proteinase K
treatment and phenol extraction. Speciﬁcity of PCR products
was routinely controlled by melting curve analyses and agarose
gel electrophoresis. DNA recovery was determined at promoter–proximal regions from 200 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream from transcription start site and at coding exons of
c-myc, hif1-a, polr2a, vegf genes, and a-satellite. DNA recovery
was measured by quantitative real-time PCR with LightCycler
(Roche Diagnostics) and normalized to control cells. The used
primers were: c-myc P2 promoter, AGAAGGGCAGGGCTTCTCAGA and TCTGCCTCTCGCTGGAATTAC; c-myc exon2,

Data were presented as mean  SD, and statistical significance was assessed with the Student t test. Differences were
considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Phosphorylation at Ser-5 of the CTD is an early molecular
event before Rpb1 reduction induced by triptolide
To conﬁrm whether triptolide can induce reduction of Rpb1
as reported (2, 4, 6) and to clarify its kinetics, we treated human
ovarian (SK-OV-3) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells with 1,000
nmol/L triptolide for the indicated time. The Western blotting
results showed that the treatment led to persistent Rpb1
reduction, beginning at the 30-minute time-point in SK-OV3 cells and at the 40-minute time-point in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). In
response to the similar treatment, interestingly, the levels of
phosphorylation at Ser-5 of the CTD ﬁrst rose before 15
minutes, reached their maximum at 30 minutes, and then
began to decrease in SK-OV-3 cells (Fig. 1B). The result was
repeatable in PC-3 cells when exposed to a lower concentration
of triptolide (100 nmol/L) for longer times (Fig. 1C). At the
same condition, however, the levels of phosphorylation at Ser-2
remained unchanged in both SK-OV-3 and PC-3 cells and the
levels of Rpb1 itself reduced persistently (Fig. 1B and C). The
data suggest that the selective induction of phosphorylation at
Ser-5 of the CTD could be an early molecular event before the
Rpb1 decrease, and the latter is possibly responsible for the
subsequent reduction of the phosphorylated Rpb1 at Ser-5 in
the triptolide-treated cancer cells.
The tumor cell–killing activity of triptolide correlates
with its RNAPII decrease
To determine whether the effect of triptolide on RNAPII is a
critical event for cytotoxic activity, we detected by Western
blotting and observed the differential degradation of the
cellular Rpb1 protein in a panel of cancer cell lines exposed
to gradient concentrations of triptolide for 6 hours (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Triptolide induced Rpb1 decrease in
a concentration-dependent manner, and 100 nmol/L was the
lowest concentration, leading to a signiﬁcant RNAPII reduction in the majority of the examined cell lines under the studied
conditions. Among those cell lines, human gastric MKN-45,
and ovarian SK-OV-3 cancer cell lines represented the ones

resistant and sensitive to the triptolide-induced Rpb1 reduction, respectively. Consistently, MKN-45 cells revealed much
lower sensitivity to the tumor cell–killing effects of triptolide
than SK-OV-3 (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1B). The data
indicate that the degree of the RNAPII decrease induced by
triptolide could be correlated with its anticancer activity.
Triptolide-induced Rpb1 decrease involves a Cdk7mediated proteasome-dependent protein degradation
mechanism
As a general transcriptional inhibitor, triptolide can lead to
reduction of cellular mRNA (2, 4). So we assessed whether the
observed decrease of Rpb1 was attributable to the downregulation of its mRNA levels. RT-PCR analyses by using different
amplicons along the Rpb1 mRNA sequence clearly revealed
that Rpb1 mRNA levels did not change signiﬁcantly in SK-OV-3
cells exposed to triptolide (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the triptolideinduced decrease of Rpb1 was independent of its new protein
synthesis as shown by cotreatments with the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; Fig. 2B), excluding the possibility that the Rpb1 decrease resulted from its reduced protein

synthesis. Instead, the inhibition of proteasomal activity with
either epoxomicin (Fig. 2C) or MG132 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) reversed the triptolide-induced decrease of Rpb1, showing that the latter involves a proteasome-dependent protein
degradation mechanism. As expected, the treatment with
1 mmol/L triptolide for 20 minutes led to increased hyperphosphorylation at Ser-5 and ubiquitination of Rpb1 in SK-OV-3
cells (Fig. 2D). The von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor
protein VHL and the tumor suppressor BRCA1 have been
reported to ubiquitinate Rpb1 (11, 24). However, the triptolideinduced degradation of Rpb1 seemed to be independent of
either of them because Rpb1 degraded apparently in VHLdeﬁcient 786-O renal cancer cells and BRCA1-deﬁcient MDAMB-436 and HCC1937 breast cancer cells when exposed to
triptolide (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To investigate the possible correlation of this protein degradation mechanism with the induction of phosphorylation at
Ser-5 by triptolide, we treated SK-OV-3 cells with the Cdk
inhibitors DRB (50 mmol/L) and H7 (500 mmol/L). DRB has
been shown to inhibit Cdk7 and Cdk9 with about 3-fold lower
efﬁciency for the former, but H7 could inhibit both of them

almost equally (3, 25). Our results revealed that at low concentrations (100 nmol/L) of triptolide, DRB completely prevented the Rpb1 degradation, but at a high concentration
(1,000 nmol/L) of triptolide, DRB rescued Rpb1 just partially.
In contrast, H7 totally prevented the Rpb1 decrease triggered
by triptolide at all tested concentrations (10–1,000 nmol/L; Fig.
2E). Together with the Rpb1 phosphorylation at Ser-5 rather
than at Ser-2 induced by triptolide, the effects of both DRB and
H7 suggest that triptolide could selectively cause the activation

degradation.
Triptolide-induced block of RNAPII at promoters
precedes chromatin-bound enzyme reduction
The above results show a potential correlation of cellular
RNAPII decrease with the phosphorylation at Ser-5 and ubiquitination of Rpb1 and its proteasome-dependent degradation induced by triptolide. However, we did not know whether

escape of RNAPII from promoter–proximal pausing sites as
in the case of camptothecin (22, 26). To exclude this possibility,
we conducted ChIP assays to detect the distribution of RNAPII
at different sites along transcribed genes at different time
points in PC-3 cells treated with 100 nmol/L triptolide. Triptolide induced a reduction of RNAPII at both promoters and
exons in all the tested genes (Fig. 4). However, the reduction
kinetics was signiﬁcantly different at the promoters and the
exons of those genes. At all the tested promoters, the decrease
of the RNAPII density was not detectable at 1- and 2-hour time
points though apparent after the 3-hour treatment; in contrast,
the levels of RNAPII bound to the corresponding exons were
markedly reduced at all the examined time points (1–4
hours; Fig. 4). Interestingly, we detected a signiﬁcant increase
of RNAPII at c-myc promoter after 1 hour of treatment,
whereas a consistent polymerase decrease was found at the
gene exons (Fig. 4A). Similar results were found at the other 2
genes, vegf and hif-1a, at the promoters of which RNAPII
density was substantially unaltered after 1 to 2 hours of
treatments, whereas it was consistently decreased at exons.
After longer drug treatments, RNAPII was reduced also at
promoter regions (Fig. 4).

these effects of the drug indeed affected the engagement of
RNAPII in transcription. Ser-5–hyperphosphorylated RNAPII
is known to be mainly located near gene promoter regions (13).
Therefore, we ﬁrst conducted ChIP assays by using an antibody
against the N-terminal domain of RNAPII in the PC-3 cells
treated with triptolide to see whether the chromatin-bound
RNAPII at the promoter regions of transcribed genes reduces.
The data revealed that 2-hour treatments with 1 mmol/L
triptolide resulted in a depletion of more than 90% of the
RNAPII bound to the promoters of transcribed myc, hif-1a,
vegf, and polr2a genes (Fig. 3A). Time course experiments with
a lower drug concentration (100 nmol/L) further showed the
signiﬁcant decrease of RNAPII at those promoters after 3 hours
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, 100 nmol/L triptolide did not reduce,
and even increased, in some cases the RNAPII density at the
tested promoters at 2 hours (Fig. 3B). These results indicate
that triptolide can trigger a reduction of the RNAPII density at
those class II gene promoters in a concentration- and timedependent manner, in agreement with the RNAPII depletion
detected in cellular extracts (Fig. 1).
In addition to protein degradation, reduction of the RNAPII
density at promoters could also result from an increased

Thus, our present ﬁndings show that triptolide can ﬁrst
induce a block of RNAPII at the promoters of active genes.
Moreover, chromatin-bound RNAPII can then be degraded
likely due to the hyperphosphorylation at Ser-5. The degradation of chromatin-bound RNAPII can likely explain the reduction of cellular mRNA levels after triptolide treatments as
reported previously (2, 4, 6).

used speciﬁc siRNA to interfere with the expression of Cdk7 in
PC-3 cells. Western blotting analyses on cellular protein
extracts showed that downregulation of Cdk7 with its siRNA
prevented the hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 at its Ser-5 and its
subsequent degradation induced by triptolide (Fig. 5A). Similarly, Cdk7 siRNA also apparently protected the RNAPII bound
to the promoters of transcribed myc, hif-1a, vegf, and polr2a
genes from degradation (Fig. 5B). The results show that the
Cdk7-dependent phosphorylation of Rpb1 at Ser-5 of its CDT is
required for triptolide-triggered degradation of both the total
RNAPII and the RNAPII bound to the promoters of the
transcribed genes.

Discussion
The transcription factor TFIIH consists of 10 subunits
including XPB and Cdk7 (27). TFIIH is a basal factor functioning at the stages of transcription initiation, promoter escape,
and early elongation. XPB with its DNA-dependent ATPase
activity opens the DNA around the transcription start site and
Cdk7 by its kinase activity phosphorylates Rpb1 at Ser-5 of the
CTD. Both are required for transcription initiation (27, 28).
Previously, triptolide was reported to covalently bind to XPB
and inhibit its ATPase activity, resulting in the inhibition of
RNAPII-driven transcription (4). Here, we further indicate that
Cdk7 mediates triptolide-induced Rpb1 degradation via
increasing its phosphorylation at Ser-5.
In this study, we showed that triptolide-induced cellular
RNAPII (speciﬁcally, its largest subunit Rpb1) decrease in
different cells and importantly, this ability of the drug was
proportionally correlated with its tumor cell-killing activity
(Fig. 1D). Moreover, the results indicate that RNAPII is not
reduced at promoters up to 2 hours of treatments (rather it is
increased in the case of c-myc), whereas it is reduced at all the
exons examined for the same time periods. Thus, we can

suggest that RNAPII block at promoters is an early event
induced by triptolide (Figs. 3–5).
These effects confer apparent biologic signiﬁcance to further exploration on the potential molecular mechanism. Triptolide was shown to lead to the Rpb1 hyperphosphorylation at
Ser-5 rather than at Ser-2 and the increased Rpb1 ubiquitination; proteasome inhibitors and Cdk7 inhibitors were revealed
to prevent the triptolide-induced Rpb1 reduction (Figs. 1
and 2). These data indicate a strong possibility that triptolide
triggers a Cdk7-mediated proteasome-executed Rpb1 degradation mechanism. Cdk7 downregulation by its siRNA interference rescued the decrease of the cellular and chromatinbound Rpb1 induced by triptolide, therefore validating this
possibility.
Comparison of our results with the previous related reports
(2, 4, 6) indicates that the triptolide induced proteasomedependent Rpb1 degradation and the correlation with its
inhibition of RNAPII-mediated transcription are clear-cut.
However, there is one apparently inconsistent but important
point, that is whether, where, and how triptolide causes Rpb1
hyperphosphorylation. Titov and colleagues (4) did not observe

the CTD plays a role in maintaining Rpb1 stability, and can
further help to clarify the other controversial issue of whether
phosphorylation of the CTD is correlated with its ubiquitination and Rpb1 degradation (8, 10, 16, 17). In addition to the
standard heptapeptide consensus sequence of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7,
in fact, there are several heptapeptide variants, including 5
repeats of Y1S2P3T4S5P6K7, 2 repeats of Y1T2P3T4S5P6K7, and 1
sequence of Y1S2P3T4T5P6K7 (Fig. 6, top; http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/nuccore/306482654). This is interesting because there
is not only a lysine residue at the 7 position but also a serine
residue at the 5 position of those sequences except the last one.
These sites are likely to be the potential targets of the E3 ligase
for polyubiquitination (Lys7; ref. 30) and Cdk7 for phosphorylation (Ser-5). TFIIH concomitantly possesses these 2 activities of the kinase for Ser-5 phosphorylation and the E3 ligase
attributing to its subunits of Cdk7 and p44, respectively (30, 31).
Moreover, triptolide has been shown to bind to the XPB
subunit, but not to other subunits of TFIIH (4). Together
with our data in this study, we therefore propose a possible
mechanism by which triptolide causes Rpb1 degradation
and transcriptional inhibition (Fig. 6, bottom). The binding
of triptolide to XPB might, via unknown mechanism(s)
(probably via the change in the conformation of the complex
as the XPB homolog structure implies a major conformational change upon ATP binding; ref. 32), activate Cdk7 and
p44. The activated Cdk7 could lead to the Ser-5 phosphorylation at the standard heptapeptide consensus sequence of
Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 and the heptapeptide variants of Y1S/
T2P3T4S5P6K7. The former might cause RNAPII stalling
and, the latter might facilitate the polyubiquitination mediated by the activated p44, which could be potentiated by the
RNAPII stalling. The ubiquitination of Rpb1 results in its
proteasome-dependent degradation. As we did not determine the acceptor sites of the ubiquitin chain in Rbp1 in
response to triptolide treatments, we cannot exclude the
possibility that Rbp1 is ubiquitinated outside from the CTD.

that triptolide had any effect on the phosphorylation of Rpb1.
According to our data, triptolide induced a biphasic change of
ﬁrst rising and then declining in the levels of phosphorylation
at the CTD (Fig. 1B and C). Therefore, it is possible that their
experimental conditions (200 nmol/L triptolide, 1 and 4 hours,
in A549 cells) are not the optimal ones for this purpose. Wang
and colleagues (6) indeed detected the Rpb1 hyperphosphorylation elicited by the drug. However, they used an antibody
against Rpb1 but not antibodies against Rpb1 phosphorylated
at speciﬁc sites. Therefore, their results did not directly reveal
the site where the hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 took place,
although they used DRB and H7, both of which are able to
inhibit more than one kinases including CDK7 and CDK9
(3, 25), to indirectly infer that Ser-2 of the CTD could be the
site. In contrast, our study used speciﬁc antibodies, respectively, against Rpb1 phosphorylated at Ser-2 and at Ser-5 to
clearly show that the site is Ser-5 rather than Ser-2. At the same
time, our data also showed the biphasic kinetics of triptolideinduced Rpb1 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-5 (Figs. 1B and C
and 2D). Wang and colleagues further used CDK9 siRNA and
cyclin T1 siRNA in their report. However, it is hard to
conclude that these siRNAs indeed prevented the triptolide-induced Rpb1 hyperphosphorylation because of the poor
quality of Rpb1 Western blotting images (6). In this study, our
data revealed that Cdk7 siRNA prevented the Ser-5 hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 caused by triptolide (Fig. 5A). Thus, our
results clearly indicate that triptolide gives rise to the Cdk7
activation that mediates the Rpb1 hyperphosphorylation at
Ser-5. However, we cannot fully exclude that Cdk9 can
contribute to the hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 as it has
also been shown to phosphorylate the CTD at Ser-5 of Rpb1 in
vitro (29).
Our study further indicates that the pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA of Cdk7 can reverse the proteasome-dependent
degradation of the cellular and chromatin-bound Rpb1
induced by triptolide (Figs. 2E and 5). This ﬁnding shows that

It could be possible that the binding of triptolide to XPB
and the RNAPII stalling elicit immediate or early transcriptional inhibition, and the subsequent persistent inhibition
results from the decrease of RNAPII due to the Rpb1
degradation.
The proposed mechanism could reasonably unify all the Ser5 hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination-mediated Rpb1 degradation, and RNAPII-driven transcriptional inhibition
induced by triptolide into 1 primary target XPB and 1 related
complex TFIIH. Our ﬁndings show that triptolide is a transcriptional inhibitor unique and distinct from all other known
transcriptional inhibitors including DRB, ﬂavopiridol, actinomycin D, and a-amanitin (3, 4, 33). Thus, triptolide could serve
as an exquisite tool to further investigate the regulation and
function of TFIIH, and act as a model compound for anticancer/other drug development speciﬁcally targeting the transcription factor TFIIH.
However, further work is required to clarify a number of
important questions about this possible mechanism. In
particular, does the binding to XPB inhibit polymerase
escape from promoters, or does the hyperactivation of Cdk7
induce RNAPII stalling? Do phosphorylation and ubiquitination indeed occur at Ser-5 and Lys7 in the heptapeptide
variants of Y1S/T2P3T4S5P6K7, respectively? Does the subunit p44 act as the E3 ligase for ubiquitination at Lys7?
What roles do the other subunits play in regulating the
enzymatic activities of XPB, Cdk7, and p44? How does the
binding of triptolide to XPB affect other subunits such as
Cdk7 and p44? The answers to those questions will help not
only to greatly expand the knowledge about triptolide but
also to more fully understand the regulation and function of
TFIIH.
