ABSTRACT
SKBR3-cells, characterized by ERBB2/RARA co-amplification, represent a
subgroup of HER2+ breast-cancers sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and
Lapatinib. In this model, the two agents alone or in combination modulate the
expression of 174 microRNAs (miRs). These miRs and predicted target-transcripts are
organized in four interconnected modules (Module-1 to -4). Module-1 and Module-3
consist of ATRA/Lapatinib up-regulated and potentially anti-oncogenic miRs, while
Module-2 contains ATRA/Lapatinib down-regulated and potentially pro-oncogenic
miRs. Consistent with this, the expression levels of Module-1/-3 and Module-2
miRs are higher and lower, respectively, in normal mammary tissues relative to
ductal-carcinoma-in-situ, invasive-ductal-carcinoma and metastases. This indicates
associations between tumor-progression and the expression profiles of Module-1 to -3
miRs. Similar associations are observed with tumor proliferation-scores, staging, size
and overall-survival using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data. Forced expression
of Module-1 miRs, (miR-29a-3p; miR-874-3p) inhibit SKBR3-cell growth and Module-3
miRs (miR-575; miR-1225-5p) reduce growth and motility. Module-2 miRs (miR-125a;
miR-193; miR-210) increase SKBR3 cell growth, survival and motility. Some of these
effects are of general significance, being replicated in other breast cancer cell lines
representing the heterogeneity of this disease. Finally, our study demonstrates that
HIPK2-kinase and the PLCXD1-phospholipase-C are novel targets of miR-193a-5p/
miR-210-3p and miR-575/miR-1225-5p, respectively.

be extremely sensitive to the anti-tumor action of all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA), the active metabolite of vitamin
A [1, 2]. In SKBR3 cells, simultaneous targeting of RARα
with ATRA and HER2 with Lapatinib results in synergistic
anti-tumor responses [1]. The molecular determinants at
the basis of this anti-tumor activity need to be identified.

INTRODUCTION
The estrogen receptor-negative and HER2+ SKBR3
cell line is representative of a recently identified breast
cancer subtype characterized by co-amplification of
the genes coding for the HER2 membrane receptor
(ERBB2) and the RARα nuclear retinoid receptor (RARA),
respectively [1]. This breast cancer subtype is predicted to

and/or Lapatinib

transcripts [3]. MiRs control numerous processes in the
neoplastic cell [4, 5] and they can be characterized as
oncogenic or anti-oncogenic [4–10]. The SKBR3 model
provides a unique opportunity to establish whether
miRs play any role in the cell-autonomous anti-tumor
responses triggered by ATRA and Lapatinib. A potential
role of these regulatory RNAs in the anti-tumor action
of ATRA is suggested by studies performed in various
cellular contexts [11–25], although very little information
is available in the setting of breast cancer cells [26, 27].
In the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line,
ATRA causes up-regulation of a single miR, i.e. miR-21
[27]. Similarly, there is limited experimental evidence
on the  links between miRs and Lapatinib anti-tumor
activity [28–33].
Here, we demonstrate that ATRA and Lapatinib,
alone or in combination, modify the miR expression
profile of SKBR3 cells substantially. Some of the miRs
up- or down-regulated by the two agents control the
growth, survival and motility of SKBR3 cells and other
cell lines representative of breast cancer heterogeneity.
The regulated miRs and predicted target transcripts
are organized in four highly interconnected functional
modules. The miR expression fingerprints defined by the
four modules are of general interest, being associated with
breast cancer progression and prognosis.

To gain insights into the significance of miRs
[20–25] for the responses triggered by the two anti-tumor
compounds, we determined the expression profiles of these
small regulatory RNAs in SKBR3 cells following challenge
with vehicle, ATRA, Lapatinib and ATRA+Lapatinib for
36 hours. Of the 1, 205 miRs represented on the microarray
[27], 330 show detectable expression levels in at least one
of the experimental conditions considered. One hundred
and seventy four miRs are up- or down-regulated by ATRA,
Lapatinib or ATRA+Lapatinib in a consistent and significant
manner (Fig. 2A and Suppl. Table S1). Principal component
analysis (PCA) of the data indicates that Lapatinib exerts a
larger overall effect on the expression of these regulatory
RNAs than ATRA (Fig. 2B). The combination of ATRA and
Lapatinib results in a further quantitative and qualitative
modulation of the miR expression profiles. The microarray
data are validated and confirmed for 8 miRs by real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Suppl. Fig. S1A). We took
two representative miRs modulated predominantly by
Lapatinib (miR-29a-3p) and by both ATRA and Lapatinib
(miR-210-3p) for further time-course studies. The
up-regulated miR-29a-3p, and the down-regulated
miR-210-3p were selected based on the following
criteria: a) high basal expression level; b) significant fold
change caused by ATRA+Lapatinib; c) high correlation
r2  value between the qPCR and the microarray data.
Lapatinib causes an early induction of miR-29a-3p with
a maximal effect at 20 hours, while miR-210-3p downregulation by ATRA and/or Lapatinib is gradual (Suppl.
Fig. S1B).

RESULTS
Multiple anti-tumor responses in the SKBR3
cell line by pharmacological targeting of
HER2 and RARα
Targeting of HER2 with Lapatinib and RARα
with ATRA results in a number of anti-tumor
responses. Both ATRA and Lapatinib cause inhibition
of SKBR3 cell growth, which is remarkably enhanced
upon simultaneous exposure to the two compounds
(Fig. 1A). In addition, a strong apoptotic response is
evident upon co-treatment with ATRA and Lapatinib
(ATRA+Lapatinib), as indicated by measurement of
caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 1B). This is observed in
conditions where treatment with ATRA or Lapatinib
alone does not result in apoptosis. Growth inhibition
and programmed cell death are accompanied by signs
of epithelial and lactogenic differentiation which are
visible upon treatment with ATRA and to a greater extent
by ATRA+Lapatinib [1]. Finally, challenge with the
retinoid or the HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases
random-motility, a process associated with the invasive
and metastatic behavior of cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Also
in this case, co-treatment with ATRA and Lapatinib
enhances the activity of the single components of the
mixture. Altogether, our results indicate that ATRA and
Lapatinib alone or in combination exert direct effects of
therapeutic relevance on the neoplastic cell.

Coordinated regulation of common targettranscripts by multiple miRNAs
ATRA, Lapatinib and ATRA+Lapatinib cause
significant perturbations of the miR and gene-expression
profiles [1] (E-MEXP-3192; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
arrayexpress) in SKBR3 cells (Suppl. Fig.  S2). To
identify potential miR targets from the 3, 144 mRNAs
altered by the treatments applied and to study the
organization of the predicted miR/target-transcript
interactions, we used two independent criteria (MAGIA
webtool, http://gencomp.bio.unipd.it/magia): 1) Direct
target transcripts of the 174 miRs regulated by ATRA
and/or Lapatinib must be predicted by at least one of
the three algorithms considered; 2) Following treatment
with ATRA, Lapatinib and ATRA+Lapatinib, the
expression profiles of the candidate target mRNAs and
the putative modulating miR(s) have to be inversely
correlated (Spearman correlation index < −0.9). This
results in 2, 829 possible miR/target-mRNA interactions
involving 89 distinct miRs and 1, 116 mRNAs (Suppl.
Table S2).

nodes. For miRs, this is the number of predicted targetmRNAs, while, for mRNAs, it is the number of miRs
which are predicted to regulate their expression. Module-1
is characterized by the largest number of miRs and the
highest degree of connectivity, followed by Module-2, -3
and -4 in sequence. Both Module-1 and -3 contain
miRs and putative target-mRNAs which are up- and
down-regulated, respectively, by the treatments applied.
Module-2 is representative of miRs and target-mRNAs
which are down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively,
in our experimental conditions. The expression pattern of
Module-4 miRs is more complex, as ATRA and Lapatinib
alone have opposing effects on these regulatory RNAs.
In Module-1, miR up-regulation and target-mRNA downregulation are predominantly afforded by Lapatinib and
they are enhanced by ATRA+Lapatinib (Fig. 3A). In
Module-2, ATRA is the predominant regulator of miRs
and target-mRNAs (Fig. 3B). Module-3 consists of miRs
up-regulated and mRNAs down-regulated predominantly
by ATRA alone or in combination with Lapatinib
(Fig.  3C). Module-4 contains miRs down-regulated by
ATRA and up-regulated by Lapatinib as well as targettranscripts with an opposite expression pattern (Fig. 3D).
Overall our data suggest that ATRA, Lapatinib and
ATRA+Lapatinib regulate the expression of four groups
of interconnected miRs, which, in turn, modulate geneproduct networks in a concerted manner.

cell-cycle (G1- to S-phase progression) as well as blood
vessel morphogenesis. Module-2 is involved in the growth
factor regulation of G1- to S-phase transit and epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is fundamental
for cancer stem cell homeostasis and tumor cell motility/
invasiveness [34–37]. Module-3 is implicated in the
WNT signaling pathway, which stimulates EMT [38–41].
In addition, the module is relevant for the process of
apoptosis and contains the same networks of cell-cycle
genes belonging to Module-1. Interestingly, the action
of Module-1 and Module-3 miRs, which show similar
regulation patterns, impinges on analogous processes.
Module-4 is enriched in pathways related to cell motility/
invasiveness, such as cytoskeleton-rearrangement and
cell-adhesion.
It remains to be established whether the enrichment
of miR target-mRNAs involved in the control of key
aspects of the cancer cell homeostasis, such as growth,
survival, EMT and invasiveness mediates or is simply
the consequence of the anti-tumor responses triggered by
ATRA and/or Lapatinib in SKBR3 cells.

The miR fingerprints associated with the antitumor action of ATRA+Lapatinib are related
to breast cancer progression
Network and enrichment analyses indicate that miRs
belonging to Module-1 through -4 act in a coordinated
manner and control the expression of distinct targetmRNA sets characterized by general relevance for the
growth, survival and motile/invasive behavior of breast
cancer cells. To evaluate whether the relevance of the miR
fingerprints defined by the four modules goes beyond the
specific cellular model used in our studies, we investigated
the expression patterns of the miRs constituting Module-1
to -4 in the clinical context of breast cancer.
In a first set of analyses, we evaluated the
expression profiles of Module-1 to -4 miRs in a small and
unique dataset (GSE38867) for which miR expression

data are available during different phases of disease
progression  (ductal carcinoma in-situ, DCIS; invasive
ductal carcinoma, IDC; metastasis, MET) and in matched
samples representing normal mammary tissue (NT).
The heat-maps in DCIS, IDC and MET vs. NT (Fig. 4,
left-panel) are highly suggestive of an inverse relationship
between the expression profiles of miRs up- or
down-regulated by ATRA and/or Lapatinib in SKBR3
cells and the corresponding profiles observed in DCIS,
IDC and MET. In other words, the levels of Module-1
and -3 miRs up-regulated in response to the anti-cancer
agents are generally lower in the three phases of tumor
progression than in NT in six out of seven cases. Similarly,
the expression of Module-2 and -4 miRs, which are
predominantly down-regulated by the two drugs, tend
to be higher in the three phases of tumor progression
than in NT. This pattern is most evident when only the

over-connected miRs (degree >50) are considered. To
confirm this relationship in a quantitative manner, we
defined similarity-scores based on all the miRs (General
Score) or the subset of over-connected miRs (Impact
Score). The General Score and the Impact Score were
calculated for the whole signature (Whole) and for each
module separately (Fig. 4, right-graphs). All the calculated
scores show a general trend towards a decrease along
disease progression. One-way ANOVA demonstrates
significance in the case of the General Score determined
for the whole signature. Interestingly, the greatest
contribution to the observed decrease from NT to MET is
provided by miRs belonging to Module-1 and Module-2.
The results obtained were validated and extended
using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, which
includes a cohort of 993 breast cancer cases. For 102 of
these patients the miR expression profiles were determined

Figure 4: Association of Module1-4 miR profiles with breast cancer progression. Using the GSE38867 from the NCBI Gene

Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds), the expression profiles of Module-1 to -4 miRs were determined at various stages
of disease progression (NT = normal tissue; DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ, IDC = invasive ductal carcinoma; MET = metastasis)
in 7 breast cancer patients. Left: Heat-map of the miR expression values (Log2 ratios relative to the corresponding NT samples). The overconnected miRs (miRs with degree >50, i.e. those with more than 50 predicted target-mRNAs) are indicated in square brackets. Right:

in tumors and matched normal mammary tissues.
A  significantly higher Impact Score value is observed
in normal relative to tumor tissues in matched patients
(Fig. 5A). This association is further supported in the
remaining 891 tumors present in the database. Indeed, this
set and the original group of 102 tumors are characterized
by similar scores. The Impact Score value is also higher in
normal relative to tumor-matched and tumor-unmatched
samples, if only the miR fingerprint corresponding to
Module-2 is considered. This is consistent with the
idea that an effective anti-tumor treatment, such as the
combination of ATRA and Lapatinib, modifies the miR
profile of sensitive breast cancer cells to make it more
similar to that observed in normal mammary cells. To
support the relationship between our miR fingerprints
and disease progression, we performed the same type of
analysis after stratification of the tumors according to size,
stage and cell-proliferation score. Tumors characterized
by a small size (T1) show an Impact Score which is
higher than the one observed in tumors characterized
by progressively larger sizes (T2, T3 and T4) (Fig. 5B,
upper-graphs). Once again a similar effect is evident if
the analysis is restricted to the Module-2 Impact Score.
Similarly, stage I show a higher Impact Score than stage
II-IV tumors (Fig. 5B, lower-graphs). Finally, inverse
correlations between Whole and Module-2 Impact Scores
and the proliferation scores of each tumor sample are
evident (Fig. 5C).
To evaluate whether the miR fingerprints identified
by Module-1 to -3 have prognostic significance, we
stratified the cases present in the TCGA dataset in
quartiles according to their miR similarity scores. The
cases in the upper quartile show an overall survival
which is significantly more extended than the one
observed in the lower quartile (Fig. 5D). The same type of
analysis demonstrates that Module-2 is the only module
characterized by a miR fingerprint associated with a better
prognosis in terms of overall survival. The difference in
survival maintains significance after multivariate COX
proportional hazard analysis with size and stage.

(miR-575; miR-1225-5p) and we performed functional
studies following transient transfection of miR-mimics
(Suppl. Fig. S3A).
The effect of mir-29a-3p, miR-874-3p, miR-575 and
miR-1225-5p on cell growth and survival was evaluated
following separate over-expression of the single miRs
in exponentially growing SKBR3 cells (Fig. 6A). The
action of the four miRs on the cell-cycle are consistent
with a growth inhibitory response. Indeed, all the miRs
increase the percentage of cells transiting through the
G0/G1-phase at the expense of the S-phase. In the case
of miR-874-3p and miR-575, a concomitant reduction
in the G2/M-phase is observed. The growth inhibitory
action of miR-29a-3p, miR-874-3p, miR-575 and miR1225-5p over-expression is not accompanied by apoptotic
responses, as none of the miRs considered affects the
basal levels of apoptosis-associated caspase-3/7 enzymatic
activity (data not shown). The proposed anti-proliferative
action of the selected Module-1 and Module-3 miRs is
consistent with the predicted anti-oncogenic properties. In
addition, induction of these miRs is likely to contribute to
the anti-proliferative responses triggered by ATRA and/or
Lapatinib in SKBR3 cells.
The General and/or Impact Scores calculated in the
small GSE38867 breast cancer dataset indicate the miR
expression profiles of Module-1 and, to a lesser extent,
Module-3 show a higher degree of similarity in NT than in
DCIS, IDC or MET. The finding suggests a possible role
of these miRs in regulating the invasive and metastatic
behavior of breast cancer cells which is suppressed by
ATRA and/or Lapatinib (see Fig. 1C). Thus, miR-29a-3p,
miR-874-3p, miR-575 and miR-1225-5p were tested for
their action on SKBR3 cell random-motility by time-lapse
microscopy (Fig.  6B). With regards to Module-1, overexpression of miR-874-3p does not alter cell motility, while
over-expression of miR-29a-3p increases cell-migration.
This last finding is consistent with a positive action on
EMT [42], a major determinant of cell motility. In contrast,
over-expression of Module-3 miR-575 and miR-1225-5p
inhibits SKBR3 random motility. Our results indicate that
miR-575 and miR-1225-5p up-regulation contributes to the
anti-motility action of ATRA and/or Lapatinib. By converse,
up-regulation of miR-29a-3p plays a detrimental role in the
process. The data support the involvement of Module-1 and
Module-3 miRs in breast cancer invasiveness.
The effects on two important processes associated
with tumor progression are consistent with the idea that the
tested miRs are endowed with anti-oncogenic properties.

Functional significance of selected Module-1
and Module-3 miRs in SKBR3 cells
The Impact Scores calculated for Module-1 and
Module-3 miRs reveal no significant associations with
the tumor relative to the normal mammary gland tissue
in the TCGA dataset. Although the integrated expression
profiles of the most-interconnected miRs belonging to
Module-1 and Module-3 are not associated with tumor
progression, the finding does not rule out the possibility
that single members of the two modules are endowed with
anti-oncogenic properties and contribute to the anti-tumor
activity of ATRA and/or Lapatinib. To address the point
with a direct approach, we selected representative miRs
from Module-1 (miR-29a-3p; miR-874-3p) and Module-3

miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p as well as miR-210-3p and we
evaluated the effects of miR over-expression (Suppl. Fig. S3B)
on the growth, apoptosis and motility of SKBR3 cells.

and miR-193a-5p increases the basal growth of SKBR3 cells.
A similar trend is observed following 48 hours of treatment
with a sub-optimal concentration of ATRA, which causes no
significant growth-inhibition in our experimental conditions.
MiR-125a-5p and miR-193a-5p partially reverse the antiproliferative effects of Lapatinib, while all the miRs considered,

including miR-210-3p, contrast growth-inhibition by
ATRA+Lapatinib. Thus, down-regulation of these Module-2
miRs by ATRA and/or Lapatinib may contribute to the
observed anti-proliferative/cyto-toxic activity. In the case
of miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p, growth stimulation is
probably the result of cell-cycle regulation, as these miRs
decrease the number of cells transiting through the G0/G1phase and increase the S and G2/M phase cell population
(Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the modulatory effects on the cellcycle are enhanced when cells are transfected with a mixture
of the three miRs, suggesting a coordinated action. The
effects of the three selected miRs extend to cell survival.
Indeed, miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p

over-expression diminishes caspase-3/7 activity, indicating
an anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 7C). SKBR3 cell-survival is
not further augmented by combined transfection of the three
miRs, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. This
supports the idea that down-regulation of miR-125a-5p,
miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p contributes not only to the
growth-inhibitory, but also to the cyto-toxic activity of
ATRA and/or Lapatinib. Individual transfection of miR125a-5p, miR-193a-5p or miR-210-3p does not alter SKBR3
cell motility. However, combined transfection of the three
miRs significantly stimulates this process (Fig. 7D). Thus,
coordinated down-regulation of these miRs may contribute
to the anti-motility action of ATRA and/or Lapatinib.

Expression profiles and functional effects of
Module-2 miRs in other breast cancer cell lines

the other breast cancer cell lines considered. The effects on
cell growth were determined by measuring perturbations
in the cell-cycle following over-expression of the three
Module-2 miRs alone or in combination. Over-expression
of the three miRs in all the cell lines following transfection
was confirmed by qPCR (data not shown). In MDAMB157 cells, forced expression of miR-125a-5p and miR210-3p replicates the proliferative effect established in
the SKBR3 counterparts. In fact, the two miRs contract
the G0/G1 phase and expand the S-phase of the cell cycle
(Fig. 9A). The growth stimulatory action is maintained,
if the three miRs are simultaneously transfected, which
is suggestive of cooperative effects. Similar pro-growth
responses are observed following individual transfection
of miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p in MDA-MB231 cells.
In the MDA-MB453 line, forced expression of miR
125a-5p and miR210-3p reduces the fraction of cells
transiting through the G0/G1 phase, once again consistent
with a proliferative action. Noticeably, individual and
combined over-expression of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p
and miR-210-3p in the Luminal/ER+ MCF-7 cell line
exerts opposite actions which are consistent with an
overall growth inhibitory effect. Indeed, individual
over-expression of the three Module-2 miRs in MCF-7
cells results in a consistent expansion of the G0/G1
phase and/or a reduction of the S phase. These effects
are accompanied by variable perturbations of the G2/M
phase. Interestingly, the anti-proliferative action of miR125a-5p in MCF-7 cells confirms results obtained in the
same cellular context by Guo et al. [43]. Taken together
these studies indicate that the action of Module-2 miRs on
the cell-cycle is highly dependent on the cellular context
considered. Nevertheless, with the exception of MCF-7,
the three Module-2 miRs exert a predominant growthstimulatory effect in breast cancer cells.
As far as apoptosis is concerned, individual overexpression of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p
does not exert any significant effect on caspase-3/7
activation in MCF-7, a known caspase-3 defective cell
line [43], MDA-MB157, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-453
cells (Fig. 9B). This is different from what is observed in
SKBR3 cells, where these miRs are characterized by an
anti-apoptotic action (see Fig. 7C). However, combined
transfection of the three miRs in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231
cells causes a significant inhibition of caspase-3/7 activity.
The data support the idea that the coordinated action of
Module-2 miRs triggers not only a growth inhibitory, but
also an anti-apoptotic effect in specific cellular contexts.
The effect exerted by miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p
and miR-210-3p on the migratory behavior of breast
cancer cells was investigated. Similar to what is
observed in SKBR3, only combined transfection of the
three Module-2 miRs results in increased migration
of the Basal/TN and highly motile MDA-MB157 cells
(Fig. 10). In the other Basal/TN MDA-MB-231 cell
line, transfection of miR-210-3p significantly increases

We evaluated whether the anti-oncogenic properties
of Module-2 miRs extend beyond the specific model of the
SKBR3 cells. To this purpose, we performed expression
and functional studies in four cell lines representative
of breast cancer heterogeneity. The panel consists of
two  luminal cell types characterized by ER-positivity
(MCF-7) and ERBB2 amplification (MDA-MB-453), as
well as two Basal/TN cell types (MDA-MB231 and MDAMB157). The four cell lines show variable sensitivity to
ATRA and Lapatinib (Suppl. Table S4).
In a first set of experiments, we determined the action
of ATRA and Lapatinib on the levels of miR-125a-5p,
miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p, in the four cell lines and
SKBR3 as a control. Similar to what is observed in the
SKBR3 model, ATRA down-regulates all the Module-2
miRs considered in Luminal/ER+ MCF-7 cells (Fig. 8A).
Significant ATRA-dependent down-regulation is observed
for miR-125a-5p and miR-210-3p in the other retinoidsensitive MDA-MB-157 cell line. In contrast, none of the
miRs is regulated by ATRA in retinoid refractory MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells. The results suggest that
down-regulation of miR-125a-5p, miR-210-3p and possibly
miR-193a-5p is associated with the anti-proliferative action
of ATRA. As for Lapatinib, the kinase inhibitor downregulates miR-193a-5p in the Her2+ MDA-MB-453 cell
line. At variance with SKBR3 cells, Lapatinib does not alter
the expression of miR-125a-5p or miR-210-3p in MDAMB-453 cells. None of the Module-2 miRs is regulated
by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor in Her2- and Lapatinibrefractory MCF-7, MDA-MB157 and MDA-MB231.
We further investigated whether down-regulation
of Module-2 miRs by ATRA and/or Lapatinib is a
consequence of cell growth inhibition or cytotoxicity and it
is independent of the anti-tumor agent considered. To this
purpose, we evaluated the expression of miR-125a-5p,
miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p following treatment with
doxorubicin (Doxo), an anti-tumor agent inhibiting the
growth of all our cell lines in the concentration range
considered (Fig. 8B). At concentrations reducing cell
numbers by approximately 25% in 24 hours (Suppl.
Table S4), miR-125-5p is significantly down-regulated by
Doxo in MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB453 and
SKBR3 cells. Doxo causes a significant down-regulation
of miR-193a-5p in MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 cells. Except
for MDA-MB157, Doxo reduces the expression of miR210-3p in all the cell lines tested. Taken together, the
data obtained support the idea that down-regulation of
Module-2 miRs is a general response of all breast cancer
cell lines to growth inhibitory or cyto-toxic stimuli.
In a series of functional studies, we evaluated
whether the growth stimulatory, anti-apoptotic and promotility actions of Module-2 miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p
and miR-210-3p are limited to SKBR3 or they extend to

occur also in the case of miR-125a-5p. In MDA-MB-231
cells, combined transfection of the three Module-2
miRs is no more effective than miR-210-3p. In the
Luminal MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines, which
are characterized by much lower motility than the
two Basal/TN counterparts, the picture is complex.

In MCF-7 cells, motility is increased by miR-125a-5p,
it is decreased by miR-193a-5p and it is left unaffected
by miR-210-3p. In MDA-MB-453 cells, the only miR
exerting an effect is miR-193a-5p, which reduces
motility. Thus, the Luminal and Basal/TN phenotypes
seem to represent primary determinants of the motility
responses triggered by the Module-2 miRs considered.

upon treatment with ATRA and/or Lapatinib. HIPK2
is one of the most inter-connected targets of Module-2
miRs and it is considered to be an onco-suppressor, as it
is a pro-apoptotic agent and it inhibits the invasiveness of
breast cancer cells [44–46]. The function of PLCXD1 is
largely unknown although its over-expression suppresses
melanoma cell growth, suggesting anti-oncogenic
properties [47].
In SKBR3 cells, the HIPK2 mRNA is rapidly
up-regulated by ATRA (Fig. 11A). Up-regulation
is  observed also with Lapatinib, although the effect is
more delayed. The increase in HIPK2 mRNA is higher
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cells exposed to ATRA+Lapatinib relative to ATRA
alone. Over-expression of miR-193a-5p or miR-210-3p
(Module-2) in SKBR3 cells down-regulates the HIPK2
transcript (Fig. 11B). In contrast, transfection of miR125a-5p has no significant effect on the steady-state levels
of the mRNA. Down-regulation of the HIPK2 mRNA
by miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p translates into downregulation of the corresponding protein. Thus, HIPK2 is
a novel and common target of miR-193a-5p and miR210-3p. In SKBR3 cells, down-regulation of the two miRs
by ATRA and ATRA+Lapatinib is likely to contribute to
HIPK2 up-regulation by the two stimuli.

in the regulation of SKBR3 cell survival. In contrast,
mir-29a-3p and miR-874-3p play a role in the process of
cell proliferation. In particular, the anti-proliferative effect
of mir-29a-3p recapitulates what was observed in two
other breast cancer cell lines [54], while growth inhibition
by miR-874-3p is consistent with its tumor-suppressor role
in non-small-cell lung as well as head and neck cancers
[55–57]. As for this last miR, it would be interesting to
know whether miR-874-3p exerts the same suppression of
the cancer stem-cell phenotype described in lung cancer
also in mammary tumors. Unlike miR-874-3p, miR-29a-3p
over-expression exerts a significant stimulatory effect on
SKBR3 cell motility. This last observation is unexpected,
as the miR has been reported to down-regulate Sparc, a
protein stimulating breast cancer cell invasiveness [58].
In Module-2, miR down-regulation is predominantly
due to ATRA and ATRA+Lapatinib. Down-regulation of
miR-96, miR-203 and miR-210-3p is consistent with
the predicted oncogenic properties of the three miRs
[59–64]. Noticeably, miR-96 promotes breast cancer cell
proliferation targeting FOXO3A, which is a major node of
ATRA/Lapatinib cross-talk in SKBR3 cells [1]. MiR-203 is
under-expressed in invasive relative to non-invasive breast
cancer cells [65], although the miR seems to function as
a tumor-suppressor in triple-negative carcinomas [66].
In contrast, down-regulation of miR-15b, miR-149
and miR-183 is hard to reconcile with their predicted
anti-oncogenic potential [67–70]. With the same overexpression approach used for Module-1, we evaluated
the action of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-2103p on the proliferation, survival and motility of SKBR3
cells. The results indicate that individual down-regulation
of the three miRs contributes to the anti-proliferative
and anti-apoptotic responses triggered by ATRA and/
or Lapatinib, as miR over-expression stimulates SKBR3
cell growth and survival. As for the proliferative action
of miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p, this is the result of a
small, albeit consistent and significant, effect favoring exit
of SKBR3 cells from the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle.
In the case of miR-193a-5p, it is interesting that the miR
has been reported to inhibit HER2 expression [50]. Thus
down-regulation of miR-193a-5p by ATRA is against
an involvement in the inhibitory effect exerted by the
retinoid on HER2 expression in SKBR3 cells [1]. The data
on cell motility indicate that the action of miR-125a-5p,
miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p needs to be coordinated to
obtain a pro-motility response. All this demonstrates that
Module-2 miRs play a role in the control of SKBR3 cell
cycle and motility, which is in accordance with our process
enrichment analysis indicating involvement of miR targetmRNAs in EMT and regulation of growth factors involved
in G1- to S-phase transition (see Table 2).
Module-3 contains miRs which are predominantly
up-regulated by ATRA and ATRA+Lapatinib.
Up-regulation of miR-21, miR-22, miR-103, mir-141 and
miR-200c supports the anti-oncogenic properties of these

statistical significance only in the case of miR-1225-5p
(Fig. 11B). The two miRs also cause a reproducible
and robust reduction in the amounts of the PLCXD1
protein. Thus, the regulatory effect exerted by miR-575
is predominantly due to inhibition of protein synthesis,
while miR-1225-5p affects both RNA stability and
translation efficiency. A third miR belonging to Module-3,
i.e. miR-188-5p, does not alter the levels of either the
PLCXD1 mRNA or protein. The data indicate that
PLCDX1 is a novel and common target of miR-575 and
miR-1225-5p. In addition, they support the idea that
up-regulation of the two miRs by ATRA, Lapatinib and
ATRA+Lapatinib contributes to the down-regulation of
PLCXD1 in SKBR3 cells.

DISCUSSION
SKBR3 cells are characterized by co-amplification
of the genes coding for HER2 and the nuclear retinoic
acid receptor, RARα, and they are representative of a
novel subgroup of HER2+ breast tumors with selective
sensitivity to simultaneous targeting of RARα with ATRA
and HER2 with Lapatinib [1]. In this study, the SKBR3
breast cancer model is used to demonstrate that ATRA and
Lapatinib regulate 174 miRs and predicted target-mRNAs
which modulate proliferation, survival and invasiveness,
contributing to the anti-tumor action of the two
compounds. About one quarter of ATRA and/or Lapatinib
regulated miRs (47/174) and potential target-mRNAs are
organized in four highly interconnected modules.
Module-1 consists of miRs whose expression is
increased by Lapatinib and enhanced by ATRA+Lapatinib.
In Module-1, up-regulation of miR-26a, mir-29a-3p, miR30d, miR-134, miR-181a, miR-320c, miR-874-3p, miR1226, miR-1181 and miR-1915 by Lapatinib and/or ATRA
is entirely consistent with the generally accepted antioncogenic action of these miRs in breast cancer or other
tumors (Suppl. Table S5). In fact, miR-26a is reported to
inhibit the growth and motility of breast cancer cells [48].
The expression profile of miR-134 in the same tumor
type suggests that the miR is an onco-suppressor [49].
Interestingly, miR-134 targets HER2 [50], whose gene is
amplified and active in SKBR3 cells [1]. MiR-181a is also
likely to be an onco-suppressor, as it reduces the ability
of breast cancer cells to induce mammospheres [51]. The
only two miRs whose up-regulation by Lapatinib and
ATRA+Lapatinib is against the predicted anti-oncogenic
action are miR-150, which promotes the growth of certain
mammary carcinoma cells [52], and miR-762, which is
up-regulated in oral squamous carcinomas [53]. With
the use of an over-expression approach, two of the miRs
belonging to Module-1, i.e. mir-29a-3p and miR-874-3p,
were directly evaluated for their action on SKBR3 cell
survival, growth and motility. Forced expression of
neither mir-29a-3p nor miR-874-3p affects the process of
apoptosis, indicating that the two miRs are not involved

regulatory RNAs (Suppl. Table S5). Specifically, miR-22
induces senescence [71] and inhibits invasiveness [72]
of breast cancer cells. MiR-103 inhibits mammary tumor
stem-cell growth [67]. Mir-141 and miR-200c belong to
the same family of miRs and they inhibit the process of
EMT in breast cancer cells [20, 73]. Although miR-21
is generally considered to be oncogenic, we recently
demonstrated that it is induced by ATRA in estrogenreceptor-positive mammary tumor cells. In this cellular
context, miR-21 counteracts the growth-inhibitory
action, while it contributes to the anti-motility effects
of ATRA [27]. As for the potential anti-oncogenic miRs
belonging to Module-3, we focused our attention on miR575 and miR-1225-5p, determining the functional activity
of these miRs in SKBR3 cells. Similar to what is observed
in the case of the two miRs belonging to Module-1, both
miR-575 and miR-1225-5p exert an anti-proliferative
action which involves effects on the cell-cycle. The two
miRs also inhibit SKBR3 cell random-motility, which is
supportive of an anti-metastatic action. Thus, miR-575 and
miR-1225-5p may represent bona fide onco-suppressors in
Her2+ breast cancer [74, 75].
The expression pattern of the five miRs (miR-148a;
miR-193a-3p; miR-205; miR-375; miR-660) present
in Module-4 is complicated, as the overall effect of the
ATRA+Lapatinib combination is the result of an opposite
regulatory action exerted by ATRA and Lapatinib alone.
For this reason, no functional studies were performed with
any of the Module-4 miRs. Given the complex expression
pattern of miR-205, miR-375, miR-660, miR-193a-3p
and miR-148a, it is difficult to discuss the relevance of
the single members of this module for the growth and
progression of breast cancer. Nevertheless, high levels
of miR-375 are present in luminal mammary tumors
and the miR seems to inhibit EMT [76]. Thus overall
down-regulation of miR-375 by ATRA+Lapatinib may
be detrimental for the anti-metastatic activity of this drug
combination. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis
indicates that the genes regulated by Module-4 miRs
control two specific aspects of cancer cell biology, which
are predominantly related to motility and invasiveness.
Identification of these four sets of miRs is of
more general interest for breast cancer biology and
their relevance goes beyond the involvement in ATRA
and/or Lapatinib anti-tumor action. The Whole miR
fingerprint defined by all the miRs contained in Module-1
to Module-4 is associated with the progression of
breast carcinoma independently of their HER2 status,
as indicated by studies comparing the miR expression
profiles in a small cohort of cases consisting of normal
mammary gland tissue and matched DCIS, IDC and MET
samples. In fact, two calculated similarity scores based on
all miRs (General Score) and the subset of over-connected
miRs (Impact Score) are higher in normal mammary
tissue than in patient-matched DCIS, IDC and MET. This
indicates that treatment of the neoplastic SKBR3 cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with ATRA and/or Lapatinib changes the miR expression
profile, making it more similar to that observed in normal
mammary gland cells. The General Score and the Impact
Score calculated for Module-1, Module-2 and, to a lesser
extent, Module-3, separately, also show a trend towards
a decrease in similarity score with disease progression.
These observations are consistent with up-regulation of
Module-1 and Module-3 and down-regulation of Module-2
miRs by an effective anti-proliferative, cyto-differentiating
and apoptotic combination of drugs. The data showing
an association between our overall miR fingerprint are
supported by the Impact Scores calculated in the much
larger TCGA dataset of breast cancer samples. In this
dataset the highest similarity scores are observed in cases
characterized by a low staging and size index, and there
is a progressive diminution in the scores as staging and
size increase. The same associations are determined if the
fingerprint of over-connected miRs belonging to Module-2
only is considered. Interestingly, the majority of genes
whose expression is controlled by Module-2 miRs are
involved in the regulation of G1- to S-phase progression
and EMT. Thus, it is relevant that the Module-2 Impact
Score is inversely correlated with the proliferation score
of the TCGA tumor samples. Regulation of EMT is of
particular significance for the inverse association with
breast cancer progression, as the process is crucial for
the homeostasis of cancer stem-cells and the invasive/
metastatic behavior of neoplastic cells [36, 77]. Taken
together the results obtained indicate that the overall miR
fingerprint and the smaller Module-2 fingerprint have
diagnostic and prognostic potential.
Given the proposed pro-oncogenic properties and
the particular relevance of Module-2 miRs for the growth
and progression of breast cancer which is suggested by the
associations observed in the clinical dataset, we focused
our attention on this specific module. We investigated
whether the regulation of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p
and miR-210-3p by ATRA, Lapatinib and Doxo as well
as their activity on growth, survival and motility is limited
to SKBR3 cells or extends to other cellular models
representative of breast cancer heterogeneity. For these
studies, we selected four cell lines [78] characterized by
distinct phenotypes and different responsiveness to ATRA
and Lapatinib. In general, the expression results are
consistent with the idea that the three miRs are endowed
with pro-oncogenic properties in Her2+ (SKBR3; MDAMB453), Basal/TN (MDA-MB157; MDA-MB231) and
Luminal/ER+ (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. In fact, the
three miRs are down-regulated by Doxo in almost all
the cell lines tested and by ATRA or Lapatinib in the
counterparts sensitive to the anti-proliferative action of
the two compounds.
The general oncogenic properties of Module-2 miRs
are confirmed by the effects of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p
and miR-210-3p over-expression on the growth of MDAMB157, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB453 which are largely
13194

Oncotarget

in line with what is observed in SKBR3 cells. The only
exception is represented by MCF-7 cells which show
complex cell-cycle responses. In fact, the expansion of the
G0/G1 phase or the contraction of the S phase observed
upon miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p
over-expression suggests a growth inhibitory action,
although this is not accompanied by the expected effects
on the G2/M phase. Interestingly, this is consistent with
the function of miR-125a as an oncosupressor suggested
by Guo et al. [43] in the MCF-7 model. The results need to
be confirmed in other Luminal/ER+ and retinoid-sensitive
cellular models, but they suggest that these Module-2 miRs
may be anti-oncogenic in this type of mammary tumor. As
for cell survival, individual Module-2 miRs seem to be
devoid of significant apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity
in the cell lines considered. However, simultaneous overexpression of miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p
reduces caspase-3/7 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells,
similar to what is observed in the SKBR3 model. In the
case of cell motility, the effects of the three Module-2
miRs are variable and highly dependent on the cellular
context, preventing us to draw any general conclusion.
A final result of our study is the identification of
HIPK2 as a novel target of miR-193a-5p and miR-210-3p
(Module-2). In fact, over-expression of the two individual
miRs in SKBR3 cells results in down-regulation of
HIPK2 mRNA and/or protein. Thus, miR-193a-5p and
miR-210-3p are likely to contribute to the up-regulation
of HIPK2 by ATRA and ATRA+Lapatinib in SKBR3 cells.
Up-regulation of HIPK2 in our model is consistent with the
anti-oncogenic properties of this homeodomain-interacting
serine/threonine protein kinase [44, 46, 79]. The kinase
has been reported to promote an apoptotic response and
to be a mediator of UV-dependent cytotoxicity [79]. In
addition, HIPK2 has been shown to inhibit the growth and
invasiveness of breast cancer cells [44, 46]. PLCXD1 is
a newly identified target transcript of miR-575 and miR1225-5p belonging to Module-3. Down-regulation of the
protein by ATRA, Lapatinib and the combination in SKBR3
cells is likely to be, at least partly, the consequence of miR575 and miR-1225-5p up-regulation. Down-regulation
of PLCXD1 in our experimental conditions is consistent
with the idea that this phospholipase C is endowed with
oncogenic properties. This is contrary to the results
reported in the only study available on PLCXD1 which
showed growth-suppressive effects in melanoma cells [47].
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
coordinated regulation of numerous miRs of potential
diagnostic and prognostic value plays an important role
in the anti-tumor action of ATRA and Lapatinib in the
SKBR3 breast carcinoma cell line. Some of these effects
are of general significance, as they are replicated in other
breast cancer cell lines representing the heterogeneity of
this disease and with a common anti-tumor agent like
Doxo. It remains to be established whether the pro- and
anti-oncogenic properties of Module-1 to -4 miRs can be
extended to tumors other than breast cancer. With respect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to this, it is noticeable that members of the miR-125 family
and miR-193a-3p/-5p are known to act as both oncogenes
or anti-oncogenes in different types of carcinomas [80, 81].

Materials and methods
Chemicals and cells
ATRA was from Sigma (St Louis, MI, USA) and
Lapatinib from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA).
SKBR3, MD-MB157, MDA-MB231, MCF-7 and MDAMB435 cells (ATCC, American-Type-Culture-Collection)
were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/cm2, cultured and treated as
described [1].

Transfections and cell viability/
proliferation assays
Transfections of SKBR3 and other breast cancer cell
lines (3.5 × 104 cells/cm2) with 30 nM miR mimics (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 0.01 nM pEGFP-N1
plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) were
performed using Lipofectamine-2000 (Life Technologies).
A list of the miR-mimics is present in Suppl. Table S6.
Cell numbers and viability were determined with an
automated Coulter Counter (BD Biosciences, Milan,
Italy). Proliferation was also evaluated with the 3-(4,
5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay [82].

Cell-cycle analysis and single-cell random
motility assays
Cell-cycle analysis was conducted on miR-mimic
and pEGFP-N1 co-transfected SKBR3 cells as described
[83]. Random-motility assays were performed on collagen/
BSA coated culture wells by time-lapse microscopy [27].

Western blots and caspase 3/7 assays
Western blot analyses were performed with antiPLCXD1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab67147), antiHIPK2 (Abcam, ab108543) and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-1615) antibodies. The secondary
antibodies were cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 conjugated
anti-IgG antibodies (Ambion). Blots were analyzed
using an automated fluorescence scanner (Typhoon,
GE-Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Apoptotic
assays  were  performed  with Apo-ONE-HomogeneousCaspase-3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

PCR and miR microarrays
RNA was prepared using the mercury-RNAisolation-kit (Exiqon, Copenhagen, Denmark) and it
was reverse-transcribed with the GeneAmp-RNA-PCRCore-Kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed
13195

Oncotarget

with the 7300 system (Applied Biosystems, software
version  1.3.1). Mature miR levels were measured with
Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems). Mature miRs were
also quantified using the Exiqon-LNA-qPCR system using
miR-425 as a normalising control. HIPK2 and PLCXD1
mRNAs were determined with Taqman assays (Applied
Biosystems) following reverse transcription of RNA with
the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core Kit (Applied Biosystems).
A list of the Taqman and Exiqon assays are shown in
Suppl. Table S6.
Human miR microarrays (Release 16.0, 8 × 60K,
G4870A) were from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
RNA was prepared from five biological replicate cell
preparations using the miRNeasy-Mini-Kit (Qiagen,
Milan Italy). RNA labeling, hybridization and data
extraction (Feature Extraction software v. 10.5) were
performed according to Agilent protocols. The results
of the miR microarray experiments were deposited in
the ArrayExpress database under the accession number,
E-MTAB-3097.

where wi is the weight of ith miR in signature (+1 for
miRs in Module-1 and -3; -1 for miRs in Module-2 and -4)
and xi is the expression value of ith miR in test samples. We
calculated two types of similarity scores: a General Score
based on all the miRs and an Impact Score based on the
subset of over-connected miRs (miRs with degree >50,
i.e. those with more than 50 predicted target-mRNAs).
The scores were analyzed in relation to tumor progression
stages in the first dataset, and to several parameters in
the second dataset: normal tissue versus tumor, tumor
size and stage, tumor proliferation score [86] and overall
survival. Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier, rank [87] and
Cox-proportional-hazard tests) were performed using
the “survival” package in R Bioconductor (http://www
.bioconductor.org).

Two active datasets from SKBR3 cells were used
for the analysis: 1) miRs selected for significant
changes in expression by one of the factors in the
described microarray experiments (ATRA, Lapatinib,
or  interaction, 36 h treatment; two-way ANOVA,
p < 0.01); 2) mRNAs selected in the same way from
previously obtained microarray data (E-MEXP-3192;
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress)
(48
hours;
p  <  0.001). The MAGIA (MiRNA-And-GenesIntegrated-Analysis) web-tool (http://gencomp.bio.
unipd.it/magia/start/) [84] was used to predict miR/
target mRNA interactions in these two datasets
(Suppl. Fig.  S2). The steps for the analysis were: 1)
identification of putative miR/target-mRNA pairs by
anyone of three prediction algorithms (PITA, miRanda,
TargetScan, filters set as default); 2) for each of these
pairs, selection of those showing a significant negative
correlation between miR and mRNA-expression
(Spearman correlation < −0.9, q-value <0.05).
Cytoscape [85] was used to analyze the predicted
interaction networks (Fig. 2C). We performed
enrichment analysis of the target genes in each Module
on Metacore-annotated process networks (http://
thomsonreuters.com/metacore/).
