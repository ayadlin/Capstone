Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
Systemic treatments for HCC have been largely unsuccessful.
OSU-03012 is a derivative of celecoxib with anticancer activity.
The mechanism of action is presumably 3-phosphoinositide–
dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) inhibition. This study investigated
the potential of OSU-03012 as a treatment for HCC. OSU-03012
inhibited cell growth of Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells with
IC50 below 1 Mmol/L. In Huh7 cells, OSU-03012 did not
suppress PDK1 or AKT activity. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and flow
cytometry analysis indicated that OSU-03012 did not induce
cellular apoptosis. Instead, morphologic studies by light and
electron microscopy, as well as special biological staining with
monodansylcadaverine, acridine orange, and microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3, revealed OSU-03012–
induced autophagy of Huh7 cells. This OSU-03012–induced
autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine. Moreover,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was detected
after OSU-03012 treatment. Blocking ROS accumulation with
ROS scavengers inhibited autophagy formation, indicating
that ROS accumulation and subsequent autophagy formation
might be a major mechanism of action of OSU-03012. Daily
oral treatment of BALB/c nude mice with OSU-03012 suppressed the growth of Huh7 tumor xenografts. Electron
microscopic observation indicated that OSU-03012 induced
autophagy in vivo. Together, our results show that OSU-03012
induces autophagic cell death but not apoptosis in HCC and
that the autophagy-inducing activity is at least partially
related to ROS accumulation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9348–57]

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide (1).
Surgery with curative intent is feasible for only 15% to 25% of
patients, and most patients die from locally advanced or metastatic
diseases in a relatively short period of time (2). To date, cytotoxic
chemotherapy has not been a standard treatment for HCC.

Recently, molecular targeted therapy, which acts on specific
dysregulated signal transduction pathways, has shown promise as
a treatment for advanced HCC (3). Development of novel agents to
enhance the effectiveness of treatment is mandatory.
OSU-03012 is a derivative of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitor, which has been shown to induce cell death in various
types of cancer cells (4). The mechanism of action is presumably
through inhibition of the 3-phosphoinositide–dependent kinase 1
(PDK1)/AKT signaling pathway (4). In addition to PDK1/AKT
signaling inhibition, OSU-03012 might also have effects on other
important signaling pathways. For example, OSU-03012 has been
shown to induce apoptosis by activation of the intrinsically
mitochondrial pathway in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia
cells (5). OSU-03012 also inhibited c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/
signal transducers and activators of transcription and mitogenactivated protein kinase pathways in multiple myeloma cells (6).
Further, OSU-03012 has been reported to cause a PDK1/AKTindependent cell death in glioma cells (7). Taken together, these
findings suggest that OSU-03012 might be a multitargeted inhibitor
that exerts its functions in a cell type–dependent manner.
Autophagy is a physiologic process involved in routine turnover
of cell constituents and serves as a temporary survival mechanism
during starvation where self-digestion becomes an alternative
energy source. Autophagy has also been proposed to involve
another biological function of clearing unfolded protein away
under certain stress conditions (8, 9). The process of autophagy
starts by sequestering a portion of the cytoplasm and intracellular
organelles in a double membrane–bound structure known as the
autophagosome. These autophagosomes form autolysosomes by
fusing with lysosomes and degrading the sequestered contents by
lysosomal hydrolases (10). However, recent studies showed that
autophagy also has an active role in cell death (9). Autophagy or
autophagic cell death, also known as type II programmed cell
death, is a response to various anticancer therapies in many kinds
of cancer cells (10). Certain forms of cell death were shown to be
prevented in the presence of either autophagic inhibitors or
reduced expression of the ATG gene, which regulates autophagy
(11, 12). Whether autophagy is a protective mechanism or a
mechanism of cell death in the response of tumor cells to
anticancer therapy remains unclear.
Certain cellular stresses can induce autophagy formation, such as
oxidative stress. Under oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are produced, including singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical,
and hydrogen peroxide. High levels of ROS induce cell death, which
often involves apoptosis through caspase activation (13). Moreover,
ROS are essential for autophagosome formation under starvation
conditions through targeting cysteine protease HsAtg 4 , an
autophagy-related gene, leading to cell survival (14). However, little
is known about the role of ROS in autophagy-induced cell death.

OSU-03012 Induces Autophagy in HCC

In this study, we showed that OSU-03012 exerted potent
cytotoxicity against cultured HCC cells as well as xenograft tumors.
We also showed that OSU-03012 induces autophagy but not
apoptosis in HCC cells and that this autophagy-inducing activity is
at least partially related to ROS accumulation.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. OSU-03012 was kindly supplied by Prof.
Ching-Shih Chen (Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy,
Ohio State University) and was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co.).
For in vivo study, OSU-03012 was suspended in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose
and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80. All chemicals were purchased from Calbiochem
or Sigma. Antibodies used in this study were phosphorylated PDK1
(pPDK1), PDK1, ATG5, ATG7 (Cell Signaling), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT),
AKT, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (MAP1-LC3B;
Novus Biologicals).
Cell culture. The human HCC cell line Huh7 was kindly provided by
Dr. Shiou-Hwie Yeh (Department of Microbiology, National Taiwan
University College of Medicine). Hep3B and HepG2 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in
DMEM (Biological Industries), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries), 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and incubated at 37jC in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2.
Cell viability assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was performed to evaluate cell viability as previously
described with slight modification (15). Briefly, tumor cells in exponential
growth were seeded at 4  103 per well in 96-well flat-bottomed plates
(Corning, Inc.) and incubated overnight at 37jC. The cells were then treated
with various doses of OSU-03012 for 72 h. Fifty microliters of 2 mg/mL MTT
were added to each well, and cells were incubated in the presence of MTT
for 3 h. The formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance was
determined with a DTX 800 multimode detector (Beckman Coulter) at
490 nm. Absorbance values were normalized to the values obtained for the
untreated cells to determine percentage survival.
Western blot analysis. Following different treatments as indicated in
figure legends, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 Ag/mL pepstatin) on
ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000  g for 30 min at
4jC. Supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was
determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal
amounts of protein (30 Ag) were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Perkin-Elmer Life
Science). The membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary
antibody at 4jC overnight. Then, the membrane was washed and incubated
with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h at room temperature. The immunoblots were visualized by
chemiluminescence HRP substrate (Millipore).
Cell cycle analysis. For cell cycle analysis, approximately 5  105 Huh7
cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes and incubated at 37jC overnight. The
cells were treated with OSU-03012 for 24 or 48 h and then suspended by
treatment with trypsin and fixed with ice-cold methanol at 20jC for
20 min. Cells were then stained with propidium iodide at the concentration
of 50 Ag/mL in the presence of RNase A (100 Ag/mL). DNA content was
analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed by CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson).
Apoptosis detection. Apoptosis was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL; DeadEnd
Fluorometric TUNEL System, Promega) performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Detection of autophagosome formation with acridine orange
and monodansylcadaverine. To detect the presence of acidic vesicular
organelles, the cells were stained with the vital dye acridine orange
(1 Ag/mL) and then examined under a fluorescence microscope. The

autofluorescent agent monodansylcadaverine (MDC) has been reported to
be specifically accumulated in autophagolysosomes and has thus been used
to detect their presence (16). In this study, OSU-03012–treated cells were
incubated with 0.05 mmol/L MDC for 10 min at 37jC and then observed
under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM2500).
Transmission electron microscopy. The cells were harvested by
trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice-cold 3% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and then
embedded in Epong. A 1.0-Am-thin section was cut, stained with methylene
buffer ArumeII, and viewed with a Hitachi 7500 electron microscope.
Immunofluorescent staining. Huh7 cells were seeded on sterilized
slides in a 10-cm dish overnight and then treated with 5 Amol/L OSU-03012
for 48 h. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for
10 min at 37jC, and then washed with PBS twice. Cells were treated with
0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS
at 37jC for 1 h. For LC3 staining, Huh7 cells were treated with mouse antiLC3 antibody (1:100 in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) at 4jC
overnight. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) was applied for
1 h at room temperature. The subcellular distribution of LC3 was observed
under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM2500).
Transient transfection and RNA interference. The small interfering
RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc., including OnTARGETplus siCONTROL Non-Targeting Pool and On-TARGETplus SMARTpool against human ATG5. For transient transfection, 2  105 Huh7 cells were
seeded in six-well plates, transfected with Lipofetamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and incubated
for 48 h.
ROS measurement. ROS levels were determined by flow cytometry
analysis and fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, cells were treated with
25 Amol/L 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(carboxy-H2DCFDA; Invitrogen) in PBS for 30 min, and then flow cytometry
analysis was performed. For ROS visualization, cells were stained with the
Image-iTLIVE Green Reactive Oxygen Species Detection kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In vivo xenograft tumor study. Six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice
were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan,
Republic of China). All experiments were performed under protocols
approved by the Experimental Animal Center of National Taiwan University
College of Medicine. Each mouse was inoculated s.c. in the right dorsal
flank with 2  106 Huh7 cells suspended in 0.1 mL PBS containing 50%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Two weeks later, mice bearing tumors reaching
200 F 100 mm3 were randomized to three groups (n = 7) and received the
following treatment daily by gavage for 28 d: (1) 0.5% methylcellulose,
0.1% Tween 80 vehicle; (2) 100 mg/kg body weight of OSU-03012; and
(3) 200 mg/kg body weight of OSU-03012. Mice were weighed every day
and tumors were measured with Vernier calipers every 2 d. Tumor volumes
were calculated with the following formula: p/6  large diameter  (small
diameter)2.
Statistical analysis. Tumor volume data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA followed by Fisher’s least significant difference method for multiple
comparisons. Tumor growth data are expressed as mean tumor volume F
SE. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis
was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for
Windows version (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
OSU-03012 inhibited growth of HCC cells. The antitumor
effect of OSU-03012 was assessed in three human HCC cell lines:
Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2. As shown in Fig. 1A, OSU-03012
inhibited the growth of all tested cells in a similar dose-dependent
manner with IC50 below 1 Amol/L. Because OSU-03012 had the
most effective cytotoxicity against Huh7 cells, Huh7 cells were
chosen for the subsequent experiments.
OSU-03012 was previously reported to inhibit cell growth
through the mechanism of PDK1/AKT signaling pathway inhibition

Figure 1. OSU-03012 inhibits growth of HCC cell lines. A, growth inhibition
effect of OSU-03012 on Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells. Tumor cells were plated
in 96-well plates 24 h before OSU-03012 treatment and incubated overnight
at 37jC. Cells were treated with different doses of OSU-03012 in 10%
FBS-supplemented DMEM for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay.
Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. B, OSU-03012 does

1 or 5 Amol/L of OSU-03012 for indicated time intervals and then harvested for
protein analysis. Cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE and probed with
specific antibodies against pPDK1, PDK1, pAKT, and AKT. Stains of h-actin
served as loading control.

in some cancer cells (5, 17). However, its effect on HCC cells remains
uncharacterized. To investigate whether OSU-03012 suppresses cell
growth through inhibition of the PDK1/AKT signaling pathway in
HCC cells, the activities of PDK1 and AKT were determined by
Western blotting using pPDK1- and pAKT-specific antibodies
(Fig. 1B). Neither pPDK1 nor pAKT was decreased by OSU-03012
treatment in HCC cells. These data indicate that OSU-03012
suppresses HCC cell growth through the targeting of signaling
molecules other than PDK1.
OSU-03012 did not induce apoptosis in HCC cells. Because
OSU-03012 has been reported to induce apoptosis in some cancer
cells, we investigated whether OSU-03012 could induce apoptosis in
Huh7 cells by TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, no apoptotic cell
was detected after 48-hour OSU-03012 treatment. This finding was
further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2B). No sub-G1
fraction could be detected after OSU-03012 treatment. Interestingly,
OSU-03012 induced an increased S-phase population in Huh7 cells
( from 19.27% to 47.51%). Similar findings were observed in Hep3B
and HepG2 cells treated with OSU-03012 for 24 hours (Fig. 2C).
Both TUNEL assay (Fig. 2A) and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2B)
showed that doxorubicin did induce apoptosis in Huh7 cells,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

indicating that the pathway to apoptosis is intact in these cells, an
observation further supported that apoptosis induction is not a
major mechanism of OSU-03012 cytotoxicity effects. Two biochemical markers of apoptosis, active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP,
were also examined by Western blotting analysis. Consistently,
both proteins were undetectable in OSU-03012–treated Huh7 cells
(Fig. 2D). These results indicate that OSU-03012 did not induce
apoptosis in HCC cells.
OSU-03012 induced autophagy in Huh7 cells. The morphologic changes in Huh7 cells were observed to characterize the effect
of OSU-03012 treatment. Compared with control cells, OSU-03012–
treated cells exhibited obvious vacuoles in the cytoplasm,
indicating the possible formation of autophagy. Autophagy is the
process of sequestrating cytoplasmic proteins into lytic components and is characterized by formation and promotion of AVO
(18). We therefore investigated whether OSU-03012 could induce
autophagy in Huh7 cells by vital staining with acridine orange. As
shown in Fig. 3A (top), OSU-03012 induced the accumulation of
AVO in the cytoplasm of Huh7 cells. MDC staining has also been
used to detect autophagic vacuoles (19). Similarly, OSU-03012
induced apparent accumulation of MDC in the cytoplasmic
vacuoles, whereas less accumulation of MDC was detected in
control cells (Fig. 3A, bottom). Quantitatively, 62% of 1 Amol/L
OSU-03012–treated cells and 96% of 5 Amol/L OSU-03012–treated
cells exhibited autophagic vacuoles, whereas only 5% of untreated
Huh7 cells exhibited autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 3B, top). Similar
results were also observed in Hep3B cells (Fig. 3B, bottom). The
ultrastructure of OSU-03012–treated Huh7 cells was analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C, numerous
AVOs were observed in OSU-03012–treated Huh7 cells. In addition,
autophagosomes and autolysosomes were frequently observed.
By contrast, there were few AVOs in the cytoplasm of untreated
Huh7 cells.
MAP1-LC3, a mammalian homologue of Apg8p/Aut7p, is
essential for amino acid starvation-induced autophagy and is
associated with the formation of the autophagosome membrane
(20, 21). To further confirm whether OSU-03012 could induce
autophagy in Huh7 cells, immunofluorescent staining was used to
detect the intracellular distribution of LC3. As shown in Fig. 3D
(top), whereas a diffused distribution of LC3 was observed in
control cells, a punctuate pattern of LC3 was observed in OSU03012–treated cells. To elucidate whether OSU-03012 induced a
specific or nonspecific autophagy in HCC cells (22), Huh7 cells were
incubated in HBSS for 4 hours. As shown in Fig. 3D (middle),
Western blotting analysis showed a significantly increased
expression of cleaved LC3 in OSU-03012–treated Huh7 cells,
whereas marginal cleavage of LC3 was observed in HBSS-treated
cells. These results suggested that OSU-03012 induces specific
autophagy in Huh7 cells. Treatment with OSU-03012 also caused
cleavage of LC3 protein in Hep3B and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3D,
bottom). These results indicated that OSU-03012 induces autophagy in HCC cells.
Silencing ATG5 and chemical inhibitor 3-methyladenine
decreases OSU-03012–induced autophagy and cytotoxicity.
ATG5 has been characterized as an ubiquitin-like protein involved
in autophagosome formation (23), and a recent study has shown
that OSU-03012 increases the expression of ATG5 and promotes
ATG5-dependent formation of LC3 (24). We therefore examined
whether OSU-03012 increased ATG5 and ATG7 protein levels in
Huh7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, OSU-03012 had little effect
on ATG7 expression but enhanced the expression of ATG5 in a

dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, silencing of ATG5 by
siRNA reduced OSU-03012–induced LC3 cleavage, indicating that
ATG5 was involved in OSU-03012–induced autophagy (Fig. 4B).
Recent studies showed that 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, could inhibit autophagy (18). We
further used 3-MA to show that OSU-03012 induced autophagy in
Huh7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C (left), OSU-03012–induced
accumulation of MDC in the cytoplasmic vacuoles was attenuated
by treatment with 2 mmol/L 3-MA. Quantitative analysis showed
that 2 mmol/L 3-MA reduced OSU-03012–induced autophagy from
62% to 36% of cells (Fig. 4C, right). To investigate whether
inhibition of autophagy affects the cytotoxicity of OSU-03012, Huh7
cells were treated with various doses of OSU-03012 for 72 hours in
the presence of 2 mmol/L 3-MA. As shown in Fig. 4D, 3-MA

reversed the OSU-03012–induced cytotoxicity in Huh7 cells.
These results indicated that the mechanism of anticancer activity
of OSU-03012 in HCC cells is partially attributable to the formation
of autophagy.
ROS mediated OSU-03012–induced autophagy formation
and autophagic cell death. Recent study showed that ROS could
induce autophagy formation in certain types of cancer cells
(14, 25). Therefore, we investigated whether OSU-03012 treatment
could increase the ROS level in HCC cells. Using H2DCFDA-based
detection by flow cytometry, ROS accumulation was observed from
6 hours and increased 2-fold after 24 hours of OSU-03012 treatment
in Huh7 cells (Fig. 5A, left). ROS accumulation was also detected in
Hep3B and HepG2 cells (data not shown). This result was further
confirmed by fluorescence microscopy with DCF staining. The ROS

to flow cytometric analysis. C, flow cytometric analysis of Hep3B and HepG2 cells. Hep3B and HepG2 cells were treated with 5 Amol/L OSU-03012 for 24 h.

scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 10 mmol/L or 4,5-dihydroxy1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron) at 5 mmol/L
abrogated OSU-03012–induced DCF accumulation (Fig. 5A, right).
We then examined whether ROS plays a role in OSU-03012–
induced autophagy. Formation of autophagy induced by OSU-03012
was suppressed by 10 mmol/L NAC treatment (Fig. 5B). Cleavage
of LC3 protein induced by OSU-03012 was also decreased by
treatment with 10 mmol/L NAC (Fig. 5C). Further, both NAC and
Tiron partially reduced the cytotoxicity of OSU-03012 in Huh7 cells

(Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggested that ROS play an
important role in OSU-03012–induced autophagy formation and
autophagic cell death.
OSU-03012 induces autophagy and suppresses Huh7 xenograft growth in vivo. To assess the antitumor potential of OSU03012 in HCC, nude mice bearing established s.c. Huh7 tumor
xenografts were gavaged with OSU-03012 daily for 28 days at two
different doses, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight, or with vehicle
only. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, 100 and 200 mg/kg

Figure 4. Inhibition of OSU-03012–induced autophagy by silencing ATG5 or chemical inhibitor 3-MA. A, Huh7 cells were treated with 1 or 5 Amol/L of OSU-03012
for indicated time intervals. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using indicated antibodies. Stains of h-actin served as loading control. B, the expression
of ATG5 in Huh7 cells was knock down by siRNA transfection as described in Materials and Methods. The cells were treated with 1 or 5 Amol/L of OSU-03012 for 48 h.
The cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using indicated antibodies. Stains of h-actin served as loading control. C, left, MDC staining. Huh7 cells were
untreated (a), treated with 1 Amol/L OSU-03012 (b), treated with 1 Amol/L OSU-03012 and 2 mmol/L 3-MA (c ), and treated with 2 mmol/L 3-MA for 48 h (d); stained
with MDC; and then observed under a fluorescence microscope. Right, quantification of MDC incorporation. At least 100 cells from each treatment group were
examined under a fluorescence microscope and the percentage of MDC incorporation in cells was calculated. Columns, mean (n = 3) for each treatment and
representative of three independent experiments; bars, SD. D, effect of 3-MA on OSU-03012–induced cytotoxicity. Huh7 cells were treated with OSU-03012 alone
or in combination with 2 mmol/L 3-MA for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD.

OSU-03012 treatments suppressed Huh7 tumor growth by 39.52%
and 57.59% after 28 days of treatment, respectively (P < 0.05
and 0.01; Fig. 6A, left). Tumor volumes were significantly reduced
by OSU-03012 treatment compared with vehicle-treated control
(Fig. 6A, right).
To study the mechanism of tumor suppression effect in this
xenograft model, electron microscopy was performed. Mice treated
with 200 mg/kg OSU-03012 or untreated for 4 days were sacrificed
and the ultrastructures of tumor cells were observed (Fig. 6B).
Compared with vehicle-treated tumor cells, autophagosomes and
dense lysosomes were easily observed in OSU-treated tumor cells.
TUNEL assay rarely detected positive tumor cells after OSU-03012

treatment for 4 days (data not shown) or 28 days (Fig. 6C). To
further support that OSU-03012 induces autophagy in xenograft,
Western blotting of cleaved LC3 was performed. As shown in
Fig. 6D, OSU-03012 increased cleaved LC3, indicating the formation
of autophagy in OSU-03012–treated xenograft.

Discussion
This study showed that treatment with OSU-03012, a novel
celecoxib derivative, induces autophagy but not apoptosis in
human HCC Huh7 cells. We showed that OSU-03012 inhibits
growth within a low micromolor range in Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2

cells. OSU-03012–induced autophagy as well as cytotoxicity were
partially reversed by 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Intracellular
ROS generation contributed to OSU-03012–induced autophagy and
subsequent autophagic cell death. The xenograft tumor model
showed that OSU-03012 suppressed Huh7 tumor growth. These
findings suggest that autophagy is a mechanism that contributes to
the cytotoxic effect of OSU-03012 in vivo.
OSU-03012 has been shown to induce apoptosis in non–small
cell lung cancer (26) and breast cancer cells (27, 28) through

inhibition of PDK/AKT signaling pathway. However, only
very limited PDK1 and AKT inhibition were detected in OSU03012–treated Huh7 cells in this study, suggesting that OSU-03012
suppresses the growth of Huh7 cells through a mechanism different
from PDK1 and AKT inhibition. OSU-03012 was found to trigger
autophagic cell death instead of apoptotic cell death in HCC cells.
We speculate that suppression of AKT activity may be necessary for
OSU-03012–induced apoptosis in some certain tumor cells. OSU03012–induced autophagic cell death is a unique cellular response

5 Amol/L OSU-03012 for 6, 12, 18, or 24 h or treated with H2O2 for 30 min and stained with 25 Amol/L DCF for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. The values
shown are the fold increase of DCF mean fluorescence intensity (DCF F.I. ). Right, Huh7 cells were treated without (a and e) or with 5 Amol/L OSU-03012 (b and f ),

then observed under a fluorescence microscope. B, effects of antioxidants on OSU-03012–induced autophagy formation. Huh7 cells were exposed to 1 Amol/L

Figure 6. OSU-03012 suppresses Huh7 xenograft growth and induces autophagy in vivo. Nude mice bearing established Huh7 tumor xenografts were randomly
divided into three groups (n = 7) and given daily OSU-03012 at 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight per day by gavage for 28 d. Controls received vehicle consisting of
0.5% methylcellulose and 0.1% Tween 80 in sterile water. A, left, tumor growth after treatment with OSU-03012. Points, mean (n = 7); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05;

in HCC cells. The underlying mechanisms of OSU-03012 effects on
HCC cells remain largely unknown.
The significance of the autophagic process in antitumor
therapeutics has not been clearly established. To adapt to adverse

cells may trigger an autophagic response that sequesters and
degrades unnecessary molecules to promote cell adaptation
and survival. For example, temozolomide induces autophagy in
malignant glioma cells as a self-defense (18). Suppression of
autophagy leads to apoptosis in glioma cells and thus enhances the

antitumor effect of cancer treatment. Therefore, autophagy may be
a survival mechanism of cancer cells (29, 30). On the other hand,
many anticancer agents, including arsenic trioxide, rapamycin, and
ionizing radiation, have been reported to induce autophagic cell
death, which is distinguishable from apoptosis in cancer cells,
indicating that autophagy might be a crucial mechanism of cancer
cell death by these agents (10, 16, 31). The postulated mechanisms
for autophagic cell death include either the autophagic digestion
of important cytoplasmic factors or the selective degradation of
regulatory molecules or organelles that are crucial for survival (9).
Whether autophagy induced by OSU-03012 in Huh7 cells is a cell
death mechanism or a protective mechanism was elucidated in this
study by applying 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. The results
showed that 3-MA could reverse the cytotoxic effect of OSU-03012
on Huh7 cells, suggesting that OSU-03012 induces an autophagic
cell death process in Huh7 cells.
Our data showed that OSU-03012–induced ROS generation
contributes to autophagy formation and subsequent autophagic
cell death in HCC cells. First, OSU-03012–induced ROS generation
was detected as early as 6 hours and had increased 2-fold after
24 hours of treatment, at which time autophagy was clearly
observed. Second, treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC reduced
the percentage of OSU-03012–induced MDC accumulation in
autophagic cells as well as the amount of cleaved LC3 protein.
Third, cytotoxicity of OSU-03012 was reversed in the presence of
NAC and Tiron. These results suggest that the generation of ROS
triggers OSU-03012–induced autophagy formation and autophagic
cell death. ROS generation is an important mediator of many
anticancer agent–induced cell deaths. A recent study reported that
ROS-induced autophagy contributed to cell death in the transformed cell line HEK293 and the cancer cell lines U87 and HeLa but
not in nontransformed mouse astrocytes (32). Park and colleagues
(24) also reported that OSU-03012 promoted autophagy in transformed cells through a PERK-dependent pathway. Whether ROS
accumulation induced by OSU-03012 might cause PERK activation
remains to be elucidated. However, ROS is very likely to damage
some sets of proteins, which may result in endoplasmic reticulum
stress and PERK activation (33, 34). The mechanism by which OSU03012 induces ROS accumulation remains unknown. It has been
reported that the accumulation of ROS may result from decreased

ROS degradation, either selective degradation of catalase (35) or
inhibition of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; ref. 32). Further
investigation of the role of the SOD-catalase antioxidant system in
OSU-03012–induced ROS generation is needed.
OSU-03012 induced significantly increased S-phase population in
HCC cells in the present study. Similar results were observed in
other cell types after treatment with different antitumor agents. For
example, resveratrol (36), soybean B-group triterpenoid saponins
(37), and nano neodymium oxide (38) have been reported to cause
increased S-phase population and subsequent autophagy formation. However, the relationship between increased S-phase
population and autophagy formation remains unknown.
In the Huh7 xenograft tumor model used in this study, OSU03012 also suppressed tumor growth. Consistent with the in vitro
findings, electron microscopy showed autophagy formation in
xenograft tumor cells. TUNEL assay found no evidence of apoptosis
after OSU-03012 treatment. Previous pharmacokinetic studies
showed that the peak serum concentration of OSU-03012 after
oral administration at 200 mg/kg exceeded 20 Amol/L (5). During
the treatment period in this study, almost all animals survived and
exhibited no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating that oral
administration of OSU-03012 delivered sufficient quantities of drug
to inhibit HCC tumor growth with little side effects.
In conclusion, our results show that the orally bioavailable drug
OSU-03012 induced autophagic cell death but not apoptosis in
HCC and that this autophagy-inducing activity was at least
partially related to ROS accumulation. This study shows a novel
biological effect of OSU-03012, which supports its clinical potential
as a component of therapeutic strategies for HCC.
