BACKGROUND: Between 30% and 50% of women who have high-grade uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) limited to the uterus at
diagnosis remain progression-free at 2 years. Adjuvant pelvic radiation does not improve outcome. The objective of the current study
was to determine the 2-year and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) among a prospective cohort of women who received adjuvant
gemcitabine plus docetaxel followed by doxorubicin. METHODS: Women with uterus-limited, high-grade uLMS and adequate organ
function were eligible. Within 12 weeks of complete resection and after confirmation that they had no evidence of disease on
computed tomography (CT) images, the patients received 4 cycles of fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine plus docetaxel. Those who were
confirmed disease-free on CT scans after cycle 4 received 4 cycles of doxorubicin. CT imaging for recurrence was performed every 3
months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. RESULTS: In total, 47 women were enrolled (46 evaluable) in 3 years. Characteristics included a median age of 53 years; 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I disease in 81% of
patients, stage II disease in 15%, and serosa-only stage IIIA disease in 4%; American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease in
13% of patients and stage III disease in 87%; a median tumor size of 8 cm (range, 2.5-30 cm); and a median mitotic rate of 18 mitoses
per 10 high-power fields (range, 5-83 mitoses per 10 high-power fields). At a median follow-up of 39.8 months, 21 of 46 patients
developed recurrent disease (45.7%). The median time to recurrence was 27.4 months (range, 3-40 months). Seventy-eight percent
of patients (95% confidence interval, 67%-91%) were progression-free at 2 years, and 57% (95% confidence interval, 44%-74%) were
progression-free at 3 years. The median PFS was not reached and exceeded 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with
high-grade, uterus-limited uLMS who received treatment with adjuvant gemcitabine plus docetaxel followed by doxorubicin, 78%
remained progression-free at 2 years, and 57% remained progression-free at 3 years. A randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy
versus observation to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy can improve survival in women with uterus-limited uLMS is

INTRODUCTION
Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor arising from the smooth muscle of the uterus. Although the majority of women
have uterus-limited disease at the time of diagnosis, patients are at substantial risk for both local and distant recurrent disease. Survival after recurrence is poor. In 1 study, the 5-year survival rate for women with 1988 International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I disease (tumor limited to the uterus) was only 51%; and, for patients with
stage II disease (tumor in uterus and cervix), the 5-year survival rate was 25%.1 Precise estimates of the risk for recurrence
among women who have undergone hysterectomy for uterus-limited leiomyosarcoma are difficult to ascertain. Retrospective studies generally have included small numbers of patients, reporting recurrence rates ranging from 30% to 80% at 2
or 3 years after diagnosis.2-5 Adjuvant pelvic radiation was studied in a prospective phase 3 trial for women with uteruslimited leiomyosarcoma or carcinosarcoma and did not demonstrate a progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival
(OS) benefit. Among all patients enrolled, the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 52%.6 Although some retrospective5,7
and prospective studies have suggested that adjuvant chemotherapy yields a PFS benefit, small patient sample sizes,

histologic heterogeneity among enrolled patients, and variations in patterns of follow-up for evidence of recurrence
have made these data difficult to interpret.8-10
Among the chemotherapy regimens with evidence of
efficacy in advanced, metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma
are fixed-dose rate gemcitabine plus docetaxel,11,12 gemcitabine,13 doxorubicin,14 and ifosfamide.15 We sought to
determine whether adjuvant treatment of women with
uterus-limited, high-grade leiomyosarcoma who receive 4
cycles of fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine followed by 4 cycles
of doxorubicin would result in at least 50% of women
remaining progression-free at 2 years. This study was
designed to enroll only patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma who were confirmed disease-free by on computed tomography (CT) scans before enrollment and to follow all
patients prospectively with CT scan imaging to accurately
ascertain the time of recurrence. The results from this study
were intended to be used to determine whether this regimen would be worthy of testing in a subsequent phase 3
trial with an observation control arm.

its; alkaline phosphatase could be up to 5 times the ULN
provided the aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels
both were within normal limits; and adequate neurologic
function, with no neuropathy worse than Common Toxicity Criteria grade 1. Exclusion criteria included: the presence of other invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, a
history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or
other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80, a history of
prior therapy with docetaxel or gemcitabine or doxorubicin, a history of congestive heart failure or cardiac ejection
fraction <50%. Treatment with hormone replacement
therapy or antihormone agents (tamoxifen, medroxyprogesterone, aromatase inhibitors) or other cytotoxic agents was
not permitted for patients on this study either during active
adjuvant treatment or in follow-up for as long as the
patient was considered disease-free.
The treatment protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions and
was approved annually. All patients signed written,
informed consent before enrollment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Treatment

Patient Eligibility

Patients received gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 intravenously
over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2
intravenously vein over 1 hour on day 8. The recommended premedication for docetaxel was dexamethasone
4 to 8 mg orally twice daily for 3 days, starting 12 to 24
hours before docetaxel. All patients received white blood
cell growth factor support with either filgrastim (granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor) 5 lg/kg (rounded to
nearest the vial size) subcutaneously on days 9 through 15
or pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously on day 9 or 10. A
complete blood count was performed before each cycle
and on day 15 of each 21-day cycle. Patients received 4
cycles of gemcitabine-docetaxel.
After cycle 4, all patients underwent a CT scan of the
chest/abdomen/pelvis to confirm that they continued with
no evidence of disease. Patients who remained disease-free
proceeded, no sooner than 3 weeks but no longer than 6
weeks from cycle 4/day 1 of gemcitabine/docetaxel, to
receive doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days
for 4 cycles. Within 6 weeks after the last doxorubicin dose,
all patients had a repeat CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to confirm that they had no evidence of disease.
Dose reductions of gemcitabine and docetaxel were
required for patients who experienced febrile neutropenia,
grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or grade 4
thrombocytopenia; docetaxel was held in patients who
developed significant liver dysfunction; both gemcitabine
and docetaxel were discontinued for grade 2 or worse

Women aged 18 years with high-grade uterine leiomyosarcoma (1988 FIGO stage I [confined to the uterine
corpus], stage II [confined to corpus and cervix], or stage
IIIA-serosa involvement only [disease could involve the
uterine serosa, but patients must have had no other evidence of local spread]) were eligible. Patients should have
undergone at least a complete hysterectomy no more than
12 weeks before enrollment. Histologic review was required
by the enrolling institution, pathology review had to have
indicated that tumor was high-grade leiomyosarcoma,16
and the mitotic rate was required to be 5 mitoses per 10
high-power fields. All patients were required to have no
evidence of residual disease or metastatic disease on postresection imaging by CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis performed within 3 weeks of enrollment on study. Patients
were not permitted to have received or to be planning to
receive adjuvant pelvic radiation. Other eligibility requirements were: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1; adequate bone marrow function, with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1500/lL,
platelets >100,000/lL, and hemoglobin >8 mg/dL;
adequate renal function, with a creatinine level 1.5 times
the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); adequate
hepatic function, with a bilirubin level less than or equal to
institutional normal limits; serum aspartate and alanine
aminotransferase levels could be up to 5 times the ULN
provided the alkaline phosphatase was within normal lim1556

pulmonary toxicity; the docetaxel dose was reduced for
grade 2 neuropathy and was discontinued for grade 3 or
worse neuropathy unless the symptoms improved to grade
2 or better with treatment interruption for up to 2 weeks;
both gemcitabine and docetaxel were discontinued in
patients who developed grade 4 edema; and docetaxel was
discontinued in patients with grade 4 hypersensitivity
reactions. Dose reductions for doxorubicin were required
for febrile neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with
bleeding, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia; doxorubicin was
held for up to 2 weeks in patients whose bilirubin
increased to >1.5 times the ULN and was discontinued if
the bilirubin did not improve in 2 weeks’ time; and doxorubicin was held for up to 2 weeks for grade 2 or worse
mucositis.
Monitoring for Evidence of Disease Recurrence
After the Completion of Chemotherapy

All patients were followed by physical examination and
CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis every 3 months
until 2 years after the completion of study treatment, then
every 6 months for the next 3 years.
Correlative Studies

The following parameters were ascertained for all patients
with the intent to determine whether any of these factors
correlated with PFS outcomes: menopausal status, patient
age, tumor size, mitotic rate, FIGO stage, and estrogen
receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. ER
and PR status was determined by immunohistochemistry
performed on paraffin-embedded tissue at a single institution and interpreted by a single pathologist as positive or
negative for each receptor.
Statistical Considerations

This was a single-arm, phase 2 trial with a target enrollment
of up to 45 patients. Safety monitoring was based on PFS
duration with the intent of closing the study early if the
PFS rate was so poor that continuing the study would be
deemed futile. The monitoring rules were based on a Bayesian model. An early stopping rule in terms of the posterior
mean PFS duration was applied continuously throughout
the trial, and the stopping rule was applied based on accumulated data when each new patient was ready to be
accrued. The trial had an 80% probability of being stopped
early if the true 2-year PFS rate was no better than 30%.
PFS, OS, and toxicity were evaluated using summary statistics, including Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS and
OS. Both PFS and OS were analyzed using time-to-event
regression. In each regression analysis, patient covariates

and PR status, tumor size, mitotic rate, uterine serosal

involvement) were included to determine whether these
variables correlated with PFS outcome.
OS was calculated from the on-study date to date of
death or was censored at the date of last follow-up. PFS was
calculated from the on-study date to the date of documented recurrence. Recurrence of disease was defined as
the development of tumor on physical examination and/or
CT scan that was considered consistent with recurrent leiomyosarcoma. Abnormalities that were considered equivocal
were further evaluated for confirmation that they represented recurrence: biopsy was recommended as ideal; however, additional or follow-up imaging was acceptable. If
follow-up imaging confirmed that a suspicious finding was
indeed a recurrence, then the date of recurrence was the
date that recurrence was first documented.
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Tumor
Characteristics

Between February 2006 and February 2009, 47 patients
were enrolled at 10 participating institutions. The median
age of participants was 53 years (range, 37-70 years); and
1988 FIGO stage distribution was 81% stage I, 15% state
II, and 4% serosa-only stage IIIA, as detailed in Table 1.
According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system for soft tissue sarcomas, the stage

Original Article

distribution was as follows: 0% stage I, 13% stage II, and
87% and stage III. The median size of the primary uterine
tumor was 8 cm (range, 2.5-30 cm), and the median mitotic rate was 18 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (range,
5-83 mitoses per 10 high-power fields). To be eligible for
study participation, all patients were required to have disease that was considered ‘‘high grade’’ by the enrolling
institution. Tumor tissue was obtained for immunohistochemistry to determine ER and PR status in 38 patients.
Sixty-three percent of tumors were positive for ER, and
50% of tumors were positive for PR. Only 4 patients were
premenopausal at diagnosis. The median follow-up for all
patients in the cohort was 39.8 months. All 47 patients
were considered evaluable for PFS and OS. One patient
died during cycle 1 of treatment because of infectious
complications of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. PFS and OS
data from these patients were censored at the time of death
(the patient with AIDS) and at the time of last patient
contact (the patient who was lost to follow-up).
Treatment Delivery and Toxicities

Eighty-nine percent of patients received all 8 planned
cycles of adjuvant therapy. Reasons for receiving fewer
than all 8 planned cycles were: 1 patient with AIDS died
during cycle 1 of treatment; 2 patients had a mild increase
in bilirubin to above the ULN and were not able to receive
either additional docetaxel or doxorubicin (1 patient
received only 2 cycles of gemcitabine-docetaxel, and 1
patient received 4 cycles of gemcitabine-docetaxel); 1
patient recurred after gemcitabine-docetaxel and, thus,
did not receive adjuvant doxorubicin; and it was believed
that 1 patient had a recurrence based on imaging studies
after 4 cycles of gemcitabine-docetaxel, but it was determined subsequently that this patient did not have evidence of recurrence. The major toxicities observed during
gemcitabine plus docetaxel were myelosuppression (grade
3 in 30% of patients; grade 4 in 4%), hypersensitivity
reactions to docetaxel (grade 2 in 21% of patients; grade 3
in 2%), neuropathy (grade 2 in 6% of patients, grade 3 in
0%), and edema (grade 3 in 4% of patients). No patient
developed pulmonary toxicity. Doxorubicin-related toxicities included myelosuppression (grade 3 in 30% of
patients, grade 4 in 13%) and mucositis (grade 2 in 2% of
patients, grade 3 in 2%).
Recurrence and Survival Outcomes

Twenty-one of 46 evaluable patients developed recurrent
disease (45.7%), and 8 patients died (17%). The median
time to recurrence was 27.4 months (range, 3-40
months). The sites of first recurrence were lung alone in 5

patient, liver alone in 1 patient, para-aortic region in 1
patient, and a combinations of sites in 5 patients. Details
of the 21 patients who developed recurrent disease are
provided in Table 2.
At a median follow-up of 39.8 months, 78% of
patients remained progression-free at 2 years (95% confidence interval, 67%-91%). At 3 years, 57% of patients
remained progression-free (95% confidence interval, 44%74%). The median PFS and OS have not been reached
(Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). In univariate analysis, no variable (patient age, menopausal status, FIGO stage, uterine
serosal involvement, mitotic rate, ER status, or PR status)
was associated significantly with PFS (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Uterus-confined, high-grade leiomyosarcoma is a high-risk
disease, and at least half of patients with these tumors develop recurrent disease. Patients who develop metastatic
uterine leiomyosarcoma have a poor prognosis, with an
estimated median survival of approximately 12 months for
those with stage IV disease. Fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine
plus docetaxel and doxorubicin are active in patients with
metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma. Whether the use of
agents that have activity in metastatic disease can improve

Figure 1. Progression-free survival is illustrated (n ¼ 47). At 2
years, 75% of patients remained progression-free (95% confidence interval, 67%-91%); and, at 3 years, 57% of patients

survival outcomes for women with uterus-limited disease is
not known. The current prospective phase 2 trial, which
enrolled a homogeneous population of patients with highgrade, uterus-limited disease and was designed with
standardized imaging intervals to capture PFS, yielded a
PFS rate of 78% at 2 years and 57% at 3 years, and the
median PFS has not been reached.
Although some limited data were collected to explore
potential predictors of survival outcomes, no variable was
identified as an independent predictor of recurrence. This
may be because of the relatively small sample size or the
number of observed events. It is of potential interest that the
median time to recurrence exceeded 2 years (27.4 months),
with some recurrences appearing as late as 40 months after
enrollment. Also of potential interest are the numbers of
patients with bone recurrences. Whether adjuvant chemotherapy had an impact on the location or timing of recurrences could be ascertained from the current single-arm
study. The distribution of metastatic sites (preponderantly
lung and pelvis; 4 patients with bone metastasis) appears to
be similar to the expectation for sarcoma.
The PFS results from our study may be interpreted
in light of results from other recent prospective studies
addressing adjuvant treatment for uterine sarcomas. Two
studies enrolled patients with early stage disease who had
a mix of histologic diagnoses (uterine leiomyosarcomas,
carcinosarcomas, and endometrial stromal sarcomas), and
1 study enrolled patients specifically with carcinosarcoma
of any stage provided the patient had undergone complete
resection. The prognosis, patterns of recurrence, and sensitivity to treatment differs among histologic subtypes of
uterine sarcomas, thus making any interpretation of crosstrial comparison of outcomes particularly difficult. In a
study of adjuvant pelvic radiation versus observation, 219

patients with uterus-limited carcinosarcoma (n ¼ 91), leiomyosarcoma (n ¼ 103), or endometrial stromal sarcoma (n
¼ 28) were evaluated. The 3-year disease-free survival rate
was 57.7% among the 110 patients who were assigned to
radiation versus 52% among the 109 who were assigned to
observation (the difference was not statistically significant),
and the reported OS rates were 58% and 56%, respectively.6 In a randomized study of combined doxorubicin,
ifosfamide, cisplatin, plus pelvic radiation versus radiation
alone, 81 patients (53 leiomyosarcoma, 19 carcinosarcoma,
9 undifferentiated sarcoma; FIGO stage I, II, or III) were
enrolled. The 3-year PFS rate was 52% (90% confidence
interval, 36%-67%) among the 39 patients who were
assigned to chemotherapy plus radiation versus 41% (95%
confidence interval, 27%-57%) among the 42 patients who
were assigned to pelvic radiation alone,17 and the median
PFS was 27 months. In a study that was designed
specifically for patients with completely resected stage I, II,
III, or IV uterine carcinosarcoma, patients were assigned to
receive either adjuvant treatment with 3 cycles of ifosfamide
plus cisplatin or whole abdominal radiation. OS was statistically superior in the group that was assigned to

chemotherapy, in which 47% of patients remained alive
at 5 years versus 34% of patients who were assigned to
radiation.18
Among patients with uterine sarcomas, the individual prognosis and relative sensitivity to systemic treatment
varies by histologic subtype. Studies that enroll patients
who have a mix of uterine sarcoma histologic types may
be difficult to interpret, because any benefit may accrue
only to 1 subgroup, and potential benefit may be obscured
by poorer survival among patients who have histologies
with the worst prognosis or by the inclusion of low-grade
histologies, such as endometrial stromal sarcomas, which
may do well without intervention. Thus, although the
observed 3-year PFS rate of 57% in our study appears to
be relatively similar to the rate among the mixed group of
patients with uterine sarcoma who received adjuvant pelvic radiation (57.7%) and also is similar to the disease-free
survival rate among patients who received combined doxorubicin, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and radiation (52%), it
cannot be concluded that these adjuvant interventions are
equivalent or superior to observation. Rather, the results
from these trials highlight the need for histology-specific
prospective studies of adjuvant therapy. The strengths of
our study include enrollment specifically for patients with
uterus-limited, high-grade leiomyosarcoma; confirmation
of disease-free status by CT imaging before enrollment;
uniform treatment of patients using agents with demonstrated activity in uterine leiomyosarcoma; prospective,
quarterly CT imaging to determine the time of disease recurrence; and multi-institution cooperative participation.
The current study demonstrates that an adjuvant regimen of fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine plus docetaxel followed
by doxorubicin can be delivered to patients who have
uterus-limited, completely resected leiomyosarcoma with
acceptable tolerability. The 2-year PFS rate was 78%,
which exceeded historic expectations of 50% remaining
disease-free at 2 years, based largely on the retrospective
data that were available at the time of study design. The 3year PFS rate was 57%. The adjuvant regimen used in this
phase 2 study is currently being compared with the standard approach of observation in an international, prospective, randomized phase 3 trial (National Clinical Trials
identifier NCT01533207) to determine whether adjuvant
chemotherapy can improve survival for women with
uterus-limited, high-grade leiomyosarcoma.
