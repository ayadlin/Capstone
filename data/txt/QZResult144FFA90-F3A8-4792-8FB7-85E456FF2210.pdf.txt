ABSTRACT
Despite advances in multimodal treatment, neuroblastoma (NB) is often fatal
for children with high-risk disease and many survivors need to cope with long-term
side effects from high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. To identify new therapeutic
targets, we performed an siRNA screen of the druggable genome combined with a
small molecule screen of 465 compounds targeting 39 different mechanisms of actions
in four NB cell lines. We identified 58 genes as targets, including AURKB, in at least
one cell line. In the drug screen, aurora kinase inhibitors (nine molecules) and in
particular the AURKB-selective compound, barasertib, were the most discriminatory
with regard to sensitivity for MYCN-amplified cell lines. In an expanded panel of
ten NB cell lines, those with MYCN-amplification and wild-type TP53 were the most
sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of barasertib. Inhibition of the AURKB
kinase activity resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the known target, histone
H3, and upregulation of TP53 in MYCN-amplified, TP53 wild-type cells. However, both
wild-type and TP53 mutant MYCN-amplified cell lines arrested in G2/M phase upon
AURKB inhibition. Additionally, barasertib induced endoreduplication and apoptosis.
Treatment of MYCN-amplified/TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma xenografts resulted in
profound growth inhibition and tumor regression. Therefore, aurora B kinase inhibition
is highly effective in aggressive neuroblastoma and warrants further investigation in
clinical trials.

deaths in children [1, 2]. Although advances in biologybased multimodal treatment strategies have led to an
improved outcome for NB patients in the recent decades
[2], survival rates for advanced-stage neuroblastoma
remain poor ( < 50%) due to the clinical and biological
heterogeneity of the cancer and a lack of adequate
treatment options [3]. Patients who undergo therapy
successfully often suffer from severe, long-term side
effects of the aggressive treatment including deafness,
cardiac failure, and secondary malignancies [4].
Development of targeted treatment approaches
has been challenging due to the heterogeneous nature
of this cancer and an insufficient understanding of the
biology of high-risk neuroblastoma. The anaplastic
lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase, ALK, is mutated in
approximately 10% of all spontaneous cases and currently
the only therapeutically-targetable receptor tyrosine kinase
in neuroblastoma [5].
In aggressive neuroblastoma, tumorigenesis is
largely driven by amplification of the oncogene MYCN
and/or structural aberrations of the genome, which are
difficult to inhibit directly. Recent research has thus been
focused on finding surrogate targets that assist MYCN
in driving neuroblastoma. Inhibition of either the PI3K
signaling pathway or the serine/threonine kinase AURKA
was shown to decrease the stability of the MYCN
protein and reduce the proliferation of neuroblastoma
cell lines and xenografts [6-8]. Both of these targets
were consequently evaluated by the pediatric preclinical
testing program (PPTP) [9, 10] and the AURKA inhibitor,
MLN8237, was advanced to the clinic in single-agent and
combination therapy trials (NCT01601535).
In this study, we identified actionable targets in
neuroblastoma using a combination of high-throughput
RNAi and small molecule drug screens. We found
knockdown of the mitotic kinase AURKB and its
pharmacological inhibition with barasertib (AZD1152HQPA) to be highly effective in suppressing neuroblastoma
cell growth. Most importantly, MYCN-amplified (MNA)
cell lines with wild-type TP53 (MYCNamp/TP53wt) were
highly sensitive to barasertib. Additionally, barasertib
effectively decreased tumor volumes and prolonged
survival in an MNA mouse xenograft model of human
neuroblastoma. Therefore, our studies have uncovered a
novel targetable susceptibility in high-risk neuroblastoma
with potential clinical application.

synthetic lethality screen using a druggable genome
siRNA panel that contained 13904 siRNAs to target 6877
genes (Figure 1A, Supplementary table S1). We selected
four cell lines from two major genetic subgroups based
on the MYCN-amplification (MNA) status: two MNA
(IMR32 and IMR5) and two non-amplified (SK-NAS and NB-EB) cell lines. Due to the known off-target
binding capabilities of siRNAs, we combined Common
Seed Analysis (CSA)[11] with Redundant siRNA Activity
(RSA) analysis [12] to minimize false positives during
candidate gene selection. In addition, we performed
Haystack analysis to detect genes targeted by predicted
seed off-target binding [13]. For a broad application in
neuroblastoma, we focused on vulnerability genes found
in either both cell lines of a genetic subgroup or hits in
three or more cell lines. We identified 211 candidate
genes by CSA and RSA (130 to 170 genes per cell line),
and two additional genes based on Haystack Analysis
(Supplementary figure S2A and B). In a confirmatory
screen, we verified 61 of 213 genes showing a significant
dependency in at least one cell line including 24 genes
common in all four (Figure 1A, Supplementary figure
S2C). To further reduce potential false-positives, we used
RNA sequencing data to ensure candidate gene expression
(Figure 1B). Whereas the majority of verified genes were
substantially expressed, 3 genes (GABRD, TINAGL1, and
KIF2B) were excluded from further consideration due to
their low expression. Thus, we identified 58 vulnerability
genes whose knockdown resulted in significant reduction
of neuroblastoma cell survival.

Vulnerability genes play a role in cell cycle
progression and larger protein complexes
To understand the function of these 58 candidate
genes and to discover underlying gene networks including
upstream expression regulators, we performed a directrelationship analysis using IPA (Ingenuity® Systems,
www.ingenuity.com). MYCN/MYC and the interacting
transcription factor E2F1 were among the strongest
expression activators of the vulnerability genes whereas
the tumor suppressor TP53 was predicted to be negatively
regulated within this network (Figure 1C). Top molecular
and cellular functions for these 58 genes were associated
with cell death and survival as well as cell cycle regulation
(Supplementary figure S3A). More specifically, we
identified a dependency on the mitotic kinase AURKB in
all four cell lines (Figure 1B and Supplementary figure
S4). Target-specific knockdown was confirmed in IMR5
(Supplementary figure S4B). As the enzymatic component,
AURKB partners with two other vulnerability genes found
in our screen, BIRC5/survivin and CDCA8/borealin, in the
chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) to drive mitosis
(reviewed in [14]). In addition, we discovered regulators
and downstream targets of AURKB and the CPC,

AURKB is a direct transcriptional target of
MYCN and high AURKB expression associates
with poor outcome in patients with MNA
neuroblastoma

including CHEK1, PLK1, TTK/Mps1, RACGAP1 and two
components of the KNL1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex
(KMN), NDC80/HEC1 and NUF2 (reviewed in [14]).
Furthermore, we identified additional cell cycle regulators,
AURKA and KIF11, as well as numerous subunits of the
ribosomal and proteasomal protein complexes (Figure 1B
and Supplementary figure S3B). We thus concluded that
AURKB and the 57 other vulnerability genes were crucial
for cell growth and particularly cell cycle progression.
In addition, these genes were predicted to be under the
transcriptional control of MYCN/MYC regulatory network
making them potential therapeutic targets in high-risk
neuroblastoma.

Selective sensitivity based on MYCN status was
recently shown for the AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 in
neuroblastoma [16] which is due to the stabilizing effect
of AURKA on MYCN [7, 8]. However, neither enhanced
expression nor depletion of AURKB showed a comparable
effect on MYCN protein level [16]. Conversely, MYCN
expression induction correlated with AURKB expression
[17]. To investigate if MYCN directly regulates AURKB
expression, we first examined if MYCN binds to the
AURKB promoter by chromatin immuno-precipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) in an NB cell line with an
inducible MYCN-expression construct [18]. We detected
a prominent MYCN binding at the promoter region
of the AURKB gene indicating that MYCN regulates
AURKB expression directly (Figure 3A). In accordance,
MNA NB cell lines and tumors consistently express
significantly higher levels of AURKB than non-amplified
counterparts (Figure 3B). These evidences suggested
that AURKB is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN.
Furthermore, patients with a high AURKB expression
have a significantly worse prognosis for overall survival
(Figure 3C), suggesting that AURKB is a potential target
for patients with MNA neuroblastoma.

Drug screening identified aurora kinase inhibitors
as selective compounds for MNA neuroblastoma
cell lines
In parallel to the siRNA screen, we treated the
same four cell lines with 465 small molecules included
in the Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) compound
library [15] to discover novel compounds against
neuroblastoma. This collection allowed us to investigate
the activity of compounds known to target 39 different
processes with relevance in oncology (Supplementary
table S2). Consistent with our siRNA screening data,
proteasomal inhibitors (3 molecules) were the most active
in both subtypes of NB cell lines (Figure 2A). Likewise,
inhibitors of other vulnerability genes including BIRC5/
survivin, CHEK1, KIF11 and PLK1 demonstrated nonselective activity in either subtype (Supplementary figure
S5A), which we confirmed in additional verification tests
of a single agent per gene (Supplementary figure S5B,
Supplementary table S3). On the contrary, aurora kinase
inhibitors (9 molecules) were not only highly active but
also most discriminatory regarding MYCN amplification
(Figure 2A and 2B). This group of aurora kinase inhibitors
included molecules preferentially targeting AURKA (i.e.
alisertib) or AURKB (i.e. barasertib) as well as both
kinases (pan-aurora kinase inhibitors, e.g. AMG-900)
(Figure 2A). MNA cell lines responded with an average
of 51% area under the curve (AUC with a median IC50
of 14.8 nM), compared to an average of 89% AUC in
MYCN-non-amplified lines (median IC50 of 38.3 µM).
Therefore, our drug screen demonstrated that vulnerability
to aurora kinase inhibition closely linked to with MYCN
amplification.

MYCN- amplified/TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma
cell lines are highly sensitive to AURKB inhibition
by barasertib
In our drug screen, barasertib was highly selective
and effective in IMR5 and IMR32 cells inhibiting
growth in low nanomolar concentrations with an almost
complete maximum response rate (Figure 2A). A recent
report, which suggested that AURKB inhibition by
barasertib stabilizes TP53 in breast cancer [19], led us
to hypothesize that the sensitivity to AURKB inhibition
in MNA NB cells is mediated by intact TP53 activity.
Therefore, we examined the response to barasertib in an
expanded NB cell line panel including three TP53-mutant
MNA cell lines, LAN-1, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-BE (2c),
and non-MNA, TP53trunc SKNAS (Table 1). Western
immunoblotting confirmed general expression of AURKB
and MYCN/MYC albeit at different levels (Figure 4A).
TP53 was detected in all cell lines except for LAN-1
and SK-N-AS which carry a deleterious TP53 mutation
(546C>A) and a homozygous deletion of exons 10 and 11,
respectively. In contrast, TP53-mutants SK-N-DZ and SKN-BE (2c) exhibited the highest protein levels of TP53,
which is likely due to an altered stability of the mutant
protein. Barasertib elicited a similarly strong response
in the MYCNamp/TP53wt cell line LAN-5 as in IMR5 and

IMR32 (Figure 4B, Table 1). In contrast, MYCNamp/TP53mut
cell lines and MYCN-non-amplified cell lines (NB-EB,
SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y) were substantially less sensitive.
Interestingly, MYCN-non-amplified SK-N-AS which lacks
TP53 expression was highly resistant to the maximum
dose of barasertib and thus featured the highest normalized
AUC of all cell lines. These data indicated that AURKB
inhibition by barasertib was far more effective in MNA
NB cells with wild-type TP53.

different concentration of barasertib. We found that cell
lines responded to AURKB inhibition with time- and
concentration-dependent loss of phosphorylation of
histone H3, an AURKB downstream target (Figure 4C).
Furthermore, barasertib treatment induced TP53 protein
expression and its downstream target CDKN1A in TP53
wild-type IMR5 cells, whereas TP53 mutant SK-N-BE
(2c) showed neither an induction of TP53 nor CDKN1A.
Inhibition of AURKB did not change protein levels of
MYCN. Therefore, these data indicate that upregulation
of TP53 and its downstream target CDKN1A resulting
from inhibition of AURKB likely induces cell death in
MYCNamp/TP53wt neuroblastoma cells.

D). In accordance with the drug response assays, 20nM of
barasertib resulted in significant cell cycle arrest in IMR5
cells, but exhibited only a minor effect in SK-N-BE (2c).
Polyploidization was only detectable in a small percentage
of SK-N-BE (2c) cells likely due to a slower proliferation
rate compared to IMR5. It is well known that persistent
G2/M- arrest as well as polyploidization can lead to
induction of apoptosis [20, 21]. In both IMR5 and SK-NBE (2c), increasing concentrations of barasertib induced
caspases 3 and 7 (Figure 5E). The inverse relationship of
decreased viability and increased caspase 3/7 activation
was observed in all neuroblastoma cell lines with a linear

to in vivo testing in neuroblastoma.
In this study, we demonstrate that barasertib is
efficacious in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with a
preference for the MYCN-amplified and TP53 wild-type
subtype. Previously, synthetic lethality between barasertib
and members of the Myc family of transcription factors
was shown in MYC-amplified small cell lung cancer
cell lines and MYC-overexpressing RPE cells [30, 31].
In addition, pan-aurora kinase inhibitors, VX-680 and
CCT137690 which also target AURKB, were reported to
sensitize cancer cells with high expression of MYC and
MYCN [31, 32]. Nevertheless, the underlying relationship
between MYCN and AURKB has not been investigated
in detail. Consistent with the report that induction of
high level MYCN leads to the upregulation of AURKB
expression [17], our ChIP-Seq data demonstrated that
MYCN directly controls AURKB expression by binding
to E-box motives in the promoter region. In contrast to
AURKA which regulates MYCN protein stability directly
[7], neither AURKB knockdown nor overexpression
were shown to affect MYCN protein levels [16] which is
consistent with our data on AURKB inhibition.
MYCN induces the expression of the tumor
suppressor TP53 [33] which is likely a reason for the
high rate of apoptosis reflected by the high mitosiskaryorrhexis index of MNA neuroblastoma [34]. Whereas
more than 50% of adult tumors possess mutations in the
TP53 pathway, it is only mutated in 2% of neuroblastoma
at diagnosis but the mutation rate rises in relapse tumors
after chemotherapy [35, 36]. Counterbalancing the general
activeness of TP53, MYCN was also shown to induce the
expression of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase and TP53-suppressor,
MDM2 [37], which is often amplified in neuroblastoma
[38]. A recent report demonstrated that AURKB can
directly phosphorylate TP53, thus priming the suppressor
for ubiquitination upstream of MDM2 [19]. Accordingly,

and the other with vehicle control starting 12 days after
tumor grafting (Figure 6A). Barasertib significantly
suppressed tumor growth in vivo (Figure 6A and 6C).
Target-specific inhibition of AURKB led to a decreased
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and an induction
of TP53 as well as activation of apoptosis as indicated by
the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (Figure 6B). Due to
the suppression of tumor growth, mice in the barasertibtreated group demonstrated a significantly increased
probability for survival (P = 0.0017) (Figure 6D). Despite
using reported dosing [22, 23], two mice died of potential
drug side effects (possible anemia and intestinal ileus)
without any detectable tumors. The in vivo study thus
demonstrated the potential efficacy of barasertib to treat
NB with MYCN amplification.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified AURKB and 57
other essential genes for neuroblastoma cell survival
by interrogating an siRNA library focused on target
druggability. The importance of AURKB was
demonstrated by the decrease of cell viability after
AURKB knockdown in 4 NB cell lines and supported
by our discovery of numerous vulnerability genes
which interact with the mitotic kinase and the CPC.
By screening a collection of oncology-relevant small
molecules in parallel, we identified the AURKB-selective
inhibitor barasertib and seven other classes of agents that
specifically inhibit other vulnerability genes discovered
in the RNAi experiments. Whereas AURKA, BIRC5,
CHEK1, KIF11, PLK1 and the proteasome are currently
evaluated in clinical trials or were preclinically examined
by the PPTP and other groups [10, 24-28], AURKB
inhibition was only suggested to be a potential target for
NB tumor initiating cells [29] but has not been advanced

combination with MYCN amplification, TP53wt cell lines
were significantly more sensitive.
We found that barasertib induced upregulation of
TP53 and CDKN1A protein levels in a dose-dependent
manner in TP53wt IMR5 which, despite CDKN1A
induction, arrested in G2/M phase contrary to an expected
G1/S phase arrest. However, MYCN-mediated overwriting
of the TP53 post-mitotic checkpoint has been commonly
observed in MYCN-amplified/wt-TP53 neuroblastoma
cell lines [40, 41]. Mutant TP53 was unaffected in SK-NBE (2c) suggesting that AURKB has a different intrinsic
effect on the mutant protein. Nevertheless, both cell lines
underwent endoreduplication resulting in polyploidy and
exhibited signs of apoptosis signaled by induction of

our data demonstrated upregulation and activation of
TP53 as a result of AURKB inhibition which suggests
that AURKB contributes to MYCN-mediated repression
of TP53 function in neuroblastoma.
The effect of TP53 on AURKB function is less
well-understood but it was suggested that activity of
AURKB inhibitors depends on the TP53 mutational
status [20, 39]. TP53-deficiency was reported to promote
mitotic slippage in barasertib-treated cells [39] as well as
apoptosis and endoreduplication upon treatment with the
pan-aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 [20]. Others found
no synthetic lethality between mutant TP53 and aurora
kinase inhibition [31]. In our study, TP53 status showed
no correlation with sensitivity to barasertib by itself but in

In a variety of solid tumors and leukemias, barasertib
has shown significant tumor growth inhibition when used
preclinically as monotherapy and when combined with
standard chemotherapeutic agents or ionizing radiation
[22, 42-49]. Phase I clinical trials in patients with
acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors attested good
tolerability with manageable toxicities [50-54]. However,
reports on the efficacy of barasertib are conflicting in
the two completed phase 2 studies in different types of
cancer [55, 56]. In this study, barasertib caused profound
inhibition of tumor growth in MYCN-amplified IMR32
xenografts. Despite the potential treatment-related death of
two mice, the drug-treated group showed complete tumor
suppression and remained tumor-free throughout the
trial, which warrants future studies to use this compound
for neuroblastoma with wild-type TP53 and MYCN
amplification.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the
importance of AURKB for neuroblastoma cell survival
and the association of high AURKB expression with
poor prognosis for neuroblastoma patients. We further
showed an AURKB inhibitor barasertib is more
efficacious in neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification
and wild-type TP53. Finally, we demonstrated barasertib
significantly suppressed tumor growth in a human
neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model. Therefore, our
study established AURKB as a rational target for patients
with highly aggressive MYCN-amplified, TP53 wild-type
neuroblastoma.

Non-silencing negative (Silencer Select Negative Control
No. 2) and lethal positive siRNA controls were obtained,
respectively, from Ambion and Qiagen.
The high-throughput RNAi discovery screen
was performed using reverse transfection as described
previously [57]. Briefly, 384-well siRNA library assay
plates were preprinted from the manufacturer’s plates,
frozen and thawed on the day of the assay. RNAiMAX
transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was
diluted in OptiMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a 6:1
lipid:siRNA (volume:weight) ratio for IMR5 and IMR32
or an 8:1 ratio for SK-N-AS and NB-EB. Neuroblastoma
cells were resuspended in growth media supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum and plated at sub-confluent
concentrations after 96h. Plates were incubated at 37˚C
and 5% CO2 for 96 hours. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
a final in-plate concentration of 0.1% was added after 24h.
For verification screening, daughter plates with
0.8 µmol of siRNA in 2 µl DMSO were printed from the
master plates obtained from Ambion. Control siRNAs
were added manually to each assay plate. RNAimax
was diluted in RPMI. Cells were added in RPMI with
20%FBS (2000 cells per well for IMR5, IMR32, and NBEB; 1500 cells for SK-N-AS). In both screens, CellTiter
Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to measure total
cell viability in relative luminescence units (RLU) with
an EnVision plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA).
For both screens, cell viability was measured by
CellTiter Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) 96h after siRNA
transfection.
For the confirmation of aurora B kinase-specific
knockdown, cells were reverse transfected under the same
conditions as the verification screen with three aurora
B Silencer Select siRNAs (s17611, s17612 and s17613,
Ambion, Carlsbad, CA), independently.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture

Data analysis for candidate selection

MYCN-amplified (MNA) cell lines, IMR32, IMR5,
LAN-1, LAN-5, SK-N-BE (2c), SK-N-DZ, as well as
the MYCN-non-amplified cell lines SK-N-AS, NB-EB,
SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y were verified by short tandem
repeat (STR) analysis. SK-N-DZ and SK-N-BE (2c) were
cultured in DMEM+ GLUTAMAX (Life Technologies,
NY) and all other cell lines in RPMI medium 1640
(1x) + GLUTAMAX (Life Technologies, NY) medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or fetal calf
serum and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin.

Raw data obtained from the discovery screen were
first corrected for plate variability by normalizing against
the non-transfected reference wells. Robust Z-scores for
each siRNA were calculated [58]. A modification of the
Common Seed analysis (CSA) as proposed by Marine
et al. was applied to take potential off-target effects into
consideration [11]. In short, siRNAs from the Qiagen
library were grouped based on matching seed sequences.
The activity of each of the members was corrected by
the median activity of all siRNAs in a group. After
median-seed correction, the collection of siRNA activities
were fit to symmetrical super Gaussian distributions
with calculated kurtosis around 6 (range 5.9-6.4) and
skewness around 1.6 (range 1.5-1.6) for each cell line to
estimate significance thresholds (Supplementary figure
S1). Assuming that the data followed an exponential
distribution (kurtosis = 6 and skewness = 2), significance
cutoffs for a p-value = 0.05 were estimated based on a

High-throughput siRNA screening and AURKB
knockdown
The druggable genome siRNA library targeting 6877
genes with two or more siRNAs/gene was obtained from
Qiagen (version 3, Valencia, CA). For the verification
screen, siRNAs targeting candidate genes, including
AURKB, were obtained from Ambion (Carlsbad, CA).

cumulative distribution function. Cutoffs for the lower
tail of the distributions were -1.15 (IMR32), -1.27 (NBEB), -1.29 (IMR5), and -1.06 (SK-N-AS). Redundant
siRNA activity (RSA) analysis was applied on the
median-seed corrected siRNAs to take the activities of
all siRNAs targeting the same gene into consideration
[12]. A rank distribution was determined for the adjusted
activities of all siRNAs and log10p-values assigned to the
corresponding genes based on an iterative hypergeometric
distribution formula. Genes targeted by siRNAs
significantly distributed at the top of the ranking (log10p
< -1.301) as determined by RSA and with at least one
siRNA active below the estimated significance cutoff were
selected as potential hits for each cell line.
To employ the knowledge on seed-based off-target
binding, Haystack analysis was implemented to identify
3’-UTR regions of genes containing complementary
sequences to the most active seeds [13]. Only genes with
a significant negative estimate were considered potential
candidates.
Analysis of the verification screen data was adapted
to the expectation that a high number of siRNAs would be
active in each cell line. The 639 siRNAs were normalized
by subtracting the positive control and dividing by the
negative control. The relative viabilities were then ranked
by RSA similar as described for the discovery screen.
Genes with a log10p-value < -1.301 were considered
verified.

ChIP sequencing experiments were performed using
the Tet-inducible MYCN3 cell line using doxycycline (1
mg/ml) for MYCN induction as previously described [18].
Actin served as a negative control. Reads were mapped
against the human reference genome (hg19) and stored
using the Genboree discovery platform. Visualization of
MYCN binding to regulatory DNA sequences, especially
E-box motifs was conducted using the UCSC genome
browser (hg19).

High-throughput drug screening assay and
nonlinear curve fitting
The high-throughput screen of the Mechanism
Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) compound library to identify
small compound inhibitors was conducted according
to Mathews et.al. [15, 60]. A full list of the compounds
and vendors is available from the authors upon request.
The main mechanism of action for each compound was
annotated based on suppliers’ information. Briefly, for
each cell line, 1000 cells were dispensed in their standard
growth media with a Multidrop dispenser into 1536-well
plates and allowed to settle overnight. Plates were then
treated with DMSO followed by the immediate addition
of bortezomib (control compound) or library compounds.
For the 11-point dilution series, library compounds were
diluted 1-to-3 starting with an in-plate concentration of
~38.3 µM. After an incubation period of 48h at 37˚C
with 5% CO2, viability was measured with CellTiter
Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) using a ViewLux imager
(Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA). Relative luminescence
units (RLU) for each well were normalized to the median
RLUs of the DMSO control wells set as 100% viability
and median RLUs of the 2 mM-bortezomib control wells
as 0% viability. Normalized dose responses were fitted to
a 4-parameter nonlinear model applying a custom girdbased algorithm that can handle outliers [61]. Retesting
of selected compounds was conducted in 384-well plates
with 1000 cells per well. Drugs were added in an 11-point
dilution series (1-to-3) plus DMSO. Viability was assessed
after 72h as described for the siRNA verification screen.
All drugs for retesting were obtained from Selleck USA
(Houston, TX).

Expression analysis
Cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with
DMSO after overnight incubation. RNA was isolated from
harvested cells using the Trizol method and the QIAGEN
All Prep DNA/RNA mini kit (Hilden, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. In short, Trizol was added
to the plates and the cell lysates transferred into tubes.
Chloroform was added for phase separation. The aqueous
phase was transferred to a fresh tube and 70% ethanol was
used to precipitate the RNA before applying the mixture to
Mini RNeasy columns for filtration. RNA was quantified
with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and RNA integrity
was measured with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Library preparation for PolyA-selected mRNA
sequencing was performed according to Illumina’s TruSeq
RNA sample preparation v2 guide (Illumina®, San Diego,
CA). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500
using the 100-bp paired-end sequencing protocol. After
fastq files were generated using CASAVA (Illumina®, San
Diego, CA), RSEM was applied to estimate the expression
levels of each gene using the hg19 reference transcriptome
[59]. Expression was calculated in fragments per kilobase
of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). A
smoothing factor of 0.6 was added to the expected count
and of 0.01 to FPKM values before log-transformation.

Antibodies and immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, the samples were harvested
by trypsinization and lysed in 2x SDS-loading buffer and
PBS. DNA was sheared by sonication. The antibodies
used were as follows: phospho- Ser10- Histone H3 (Cat.#
9715), AURKB (Cat.# 3049) and Cleaved Caspase-3
(Cat.# 9661) from Cell Signaling, TP53 (Cat.# sc-126) and

used for signal detection.

system (Caliper Life Science, Hopkinton, MA). Tumor
size was measured by caliper twice a week and tumor
volume was calculated using this formula: (long axis x
short axis2)/2. The endpoint of the experiment was any
tumor axis reaching 20mm. To investigate target-specific
effects of barasertib in vivo, mice of the control arm were
treated with either a cycle of four daily doses of 50mg/
kg barasertib or vehicle control immediately after the
endpoint of the tumor growth study was reached. Protein
isolation from these tumors for immunoblotting was done
in RIPA-buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (sodium
orthovanadate and NaF) and protease inhibitors (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a gentleMACS Dissociator
(Miltenyi, San Diego, CA) for tissue homogenization.

Flow cytometry
IMR5 and SK-N-BE (2c) were plated into T25 flasks
for cell cycle analysis and allowed to attach overnight at
subconfluent concentrations after 48h. IMR5 cells were
treated with 8 nM, 12 nM, 16 nM and 20 nM of barasertib
whereas SK-N-BE (2c) cells were treated with 20 nM, 50
nM, 100 nM, 500 nM and 1 µM of the compound. The
Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit
(Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) was used for cell cycle
assessment according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In short, cells were treated with 10 µM EdU (1:1000)
for 2h before collection after 24h and 48h. Cells were
fixed, permeabilized, and washed before incubating the
samples with the Click-iT reaction cocktail for 30min at
RT. FxCycle Violet (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) was
used to counterstain DNA. Flow cytometric analysis was
performed on a BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were acquired with the
BD FACSDiva software and analyzed with FlowJo version
10 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR).

Xenograft studies
A human neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model
was used to examine the efficacy of barasertib for treating
MYCN-amplified tumors. Animal studies were performed
with 4- to 6-week-old female NOD scid gamma (NSG)
mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY). Five million IMR32
neuroblastoma cells stably expressing luciferase in 100
µl 1:1 HBSS:Matrigel solution (Cultrex® 3D culture
matrix reduced growth factor basement membrane
extract PathClear®, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD)
were subcutaneously engrafted into the right flank
of each mouse to generate an in vivo neuroblastoma
xenograft model. Barasertib was obtained through the
Developmental Therapeutics Program, the Division
of Cancer Treatment Diagnosis and Centers, National
Cancer Institute. Barasertib was dissolved in a solution
vehicle made of 30% PEG400, 0.5% Tween 80, 5%
Propylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and
administrated to the mice via intraperitoneal injection at
50mg/kg four times a week for two consecutive weeks.
Mice were monitored weekly by palpation twice and
