ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide. High mortality from HCC is mainly due to widespread prevalence
and the lack of effective treatment, since systemic chemotherapy is ineffective,
while the targeted agent Sorafenib extends median survival only briefly. The
steroidal saponin 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is proposed
to chemosensitize to various therapeutic drugs through an unknown mechanism.
Since autophagy often serves as cell survival mechanism in cancer cells exposed to
chemotherapeutic agents, we examined the ability of Rg3 to inhibit autophagy and
chemosensitize HCC cell lines to doxorubicin in vitro. We show that Rg3 inhibits late
stage autophagy, possibly through changes in gene expression. Doxorubicin-induced
autophagy plays a protective role in HCC cells, and therefore Rg3 treatment synergizes
with doxorubicin to kill HCC cell lines, but the combination is relatively nontoxic in
normal liver cells. In addition, Rg3 was well-tolerated in mice and synergized with
doxorubicin to inhibit tumor growth in HCC xenografts in vivo. Since novel in vivo
inhibitors of autophagy are desirable for clinical use, we propose that Rg3 is such a
compound, and that combination therapy with classical chemotherapeutic drugs may
represent an effective therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.

INTRODUCTION

in response to a number of stressors, including cancer
chemotherapeutics, and therefore, inhibition of autophagy
sensitizes to cell death in many cases. Conversely, under
certain conditions, the overactivation of autophagy by
some stimuli promotes cell death [8]. In most situations,
however, even when there is real increase of autophagic
flux in the dying cells, enhanced autophagy may indicate
an attempt by the cell to prevent itself from dying [9-11].
Careful study is therefore needed to determine the function
of autophagy in cell death and survival under different
conditions.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most

Autophagy is a catabolic cellular degradation
response to various stresses whereby cellular proteins,
organelles and cytoplasm are engulfed, digested and
recycled to sustain cellular metabolism [1-3]. Autophagy
has diverse biological functions, and plays a role in many
physiological and pathological processes, including
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and immunity [4]. In
cancer, it plays important functions both in cell death and
survival, as well as tumor progression [5-7]. Autophagy
is generally recognized as a pro-survival mechanism

common solid tumors and the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high mortality rate
in HCC patients is mainly due to the lack of effective
treatment, especially for those with advanced disease.
To date, systemic therapy with classical cytotoxic
chemotherapy is generally poorly tolerated and ineffective
for HCC, and effective therapy with targeted agents is
currently limited to the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib.
For this reason, new and more effective therapeutic
options for this form of cancer were eagerly sought after.
Combination therapies are being developed as a more
promising therapeutic strategy in HCC treatment [12,
13]. Since autophagy is often a pro-survival response to
chemotherapeutic drugs, combination therapies where
autophagy is inhibited during chemotherapy may be a
good therapeutic strategy. Inhibition of autophagy may
especially be useful in sensitizing HCC cells to both
sorafenib and other classical chemotherapeutic treatment
[14, 15]. Currently, chloroquine, and its derivative,
hydroxychloroquine, are the only FDA approved drugs that
are currently used in patients as inhibitors of autophagy.
Additional clinical agents that prevent autophagy are
currently being explored, but none have yet been approved
for use in the clinic.
Ginsenoside Rg3 extracted from the steamed
Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is one of a diverse group of
steroidal saponins with high pharmacological activity
[16]. Stereospecific effects have been observed from this
compound, with the 20(R) enantiomer, for instance, being
more active as an antioxidant and in its promotion of the
immune response [17, 18], and the 20(S) having a greater
potential anti-diabetic activity [19]. While the 20(R)
enantiomer of this compound is poorly soluble, the 20(S)
enantiomer has a much higher solubility, thus making it
more suitable for pharmaceutical development. The 20(S)
Rg3 stereoisomer has also been shown to be remarkably
non-toxic and well-tolerated in mice, rats, and dogs [2022]. Several findings suggest that Rg3 may increase the
efficacy of cancer chemotherapy [16, 22-24]. A number
of molecular mechanisms have been proposed for such
anti-cancer function, among which are inhibitory effects
on NF-κB and AP-1 activity [25], and the down-regulation
of angiogenesis associated with VEGF expression [23, 24,
26-28]. However, the related ginseng-derived ginsenosides
Rb1 and Rk1 have been shown to have effects on
autophagy. Rb1, for instance, has an influence on the
activation of autophagy in glutamate-injured neurons [29],
while the anti-tumor activity of Rk1 is thought to be due
to its ability to modulate autophagy [30]. The mechanism
of autophagy modulation by ginsenosides is unclear and
there is currently no published data showing that 20(S)ginsenoside Rg3 affects autophagy.
In the present study, we investigated the effect of
the 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 on modulation of autophagy
in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines to evaluate whether
this is relevant to the sensitization effect of Rg3 on cell

death induced by doxorubicin, a commonly used cancer
therapeutic agent in a wide range of cancers. Our data
show that Rg3 is capable of inhibiting autophagic flux
via suppressing late stage autophagosome maturation or
degradation. Because doxorubicin- induced autophagy
has a pro-survival function, Rg3-induced suppression of
autophagy contributes to its sensitization of HCC cells
to doxorubicin-induced cell death. Synergism of Rg3
and doxorubicin was confirmed in vivo using a mouse
xenograft model. Our data therefore suggests that the
inhibitory effect of Rg3 on autophagy is functionally
related to its sensitization effect on doxorubicin-induced
cell death and that such a combination therapy could serve
as a novel strategy in treating HCC.

RESULTS
Rg3 enhances LC3 II stability and puncta
formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
Several earlier studies have suggested that Rg3
may have anti-tumor activity but its mechanism of action
is unclear. We examined the effect of Rg3 on autophagy
by measuring LC3 II protein levels in Rg3-treated cells.
Rg3 treatment of SK-Hep1 hepatocellular carcinoma cells
increased the amount of LC3 II protein in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 1A and 1B). To determine
whether this effect was specific, we compared the effect
of Rg3 on 4 different hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines
(Figure 1C) and two different lung cancer cell lines
(Figure S1). All cell lines tested show similar trends in
LC3 II protein levels following Rg3 treatment, suggesting
that the effect of Rg3 on autophagy is not cell type specific.
Rg3 treatment also markedly increased GFP-LC3 puncta
formation in SK-Hep1 cells (Figure 1D) and in HepG2
cells (Figure S2), confirming that Rg3 treatment affects
autophagy.
We verified that the Rg3-induced increase in LC3 II
formation and GFP-LC3 puncta are due to Rg3 effects on
the ATG5-dependent autophagic pathway by using Tet-off
Atg5-/- MEF cells in which Atg5 and GFP-LC3 are stably
expressed [31]. In this system, Atg5 gene expression is
abolished following treatment with doxycycline. Rg3
enhanced LC3 II formation in MEF cells in the presence of
Atg5, but not in its absence (Figure S3A). Consistent with
the LC3 II conversion data, the punctuation/aggregation of
GFP-LC3 was only induced in cells expressing Atg5, but
not in cells without Atg5 (Figure S3B).

Rg3 inhibits autophagic flux in the late stages of
autophagy

in p62 (Figure 2A, S4). Stabilization of p62 levels was
accompanied by additional ubiquitination, suggesting
that Rg3 inhibits its degradation without interfering
with the normal ubiquitination process (Figure S4A-B).
Additionally, when cells were treated with chloroquine
(CQ), which blocks late stage autophagy by impairing
lysosomal acidification, Rg3 did not substantially enhance
the LC3 II and p62 protein levels (Figure 2B). This
suggests that the increased LC3 II conversion and GFPLC3 puncta formation in Rg3-treated cells is not due to
enhanced autophagy, but is rather due to suppression of
the late maturation or degradation stage of autophagy,

An increase in LC3 II in response to a drug may
represent either increased generation of autophagosomes
and/or a blockage in autophagosomal maturation and
degradation [32-35]. The multifunctional cargo protein,
p62/SQSTM1, binds to LC3 and is degraded with its cargo
within autolysosomes [36]. Thus, a reduction of p62 can
be regarded as a marker for an increase in autophagic flux
[34, 37]. However, Rg3 treatment rather led to an increase

resulting in a block in autophagic flux.
In order to further test whether the effect of Rg3
is due to suppressed autophagic flux, we utilized a
tandem labeled GFP-mRFP-LC3 construct (tfLC3).
The tfLC3 construct has been reported to be a useful
tool for examining autophagosome maturation and
autolysosome formation, and is particularly helpful
in distinguishing increased autophagy from a block
in autophagic flux [38, 39]. In this assay, since mRFP
is much more resistant to quenching than GFP in the
acidic environment of the lysosome, if the autolysosome
maturation proceeds normally or flux is increased, this
is indicated by additional or substantially increased redonly puncta. In contrast, if the autophagosome does not
fuse with lysosome or lysosomal function is blocked,
most of the puncta should exhibit both red and green
fluorescence and thus appear to be yellow in merged

images [38]. Rg3 treatment of SK-Hep1 cells transiently
transfected with tfLC3 led to formation both GFP and
mRFP punctuation that extensively co-localize with
each other and thus appear yellow, suggesting that upon
Rg3 treatment the autophagosomes do not fuse with
lysosomes or that lysosomal function is impaired (Figure
2C). In contrast, induction of autophagy by nutrient
starvation led to the production of large amounts of
red-only puncta, while the Rg3 effect was similar to CQ
treatment, which blocks lysosomal function, indicating
that Rg3 prevents autophagic flux, and does not increase
it (Figure 2C). In both SK-Hep1 and HepG2 cells stably
expressing tfLC, we observed a decreased mCherry/GFP
fluorescence ratio in Rg3-treated cells as measured by
flow cytometry, indicating that Rg3 reduced the amount
of autophagic flux in both cell lines (Figure 2D-E). Rg3
treatment prevented the starvation-induced degradation of

LC3II in both SK-Hep1 and HepG2 cells (Figure S5A).
Additional confirmation that Rg3 was capable to some
extent of inhibiting a strong autophagic stimulus was
shown by a decreased mCherry/GFP fluorescence ratio
in Rg3 pretreated cells that were then additionally treated
with EBSS (Figure S5B), although long term co-treatment
was somewhat toxic. Together with the previous data, this
suggests Rg3 suppresses autophagic flux by interfering
with late-stage autophagy.

cell death as measured by both MTT and LDH release
assays, indicating a pro-survival role for autophagy in
doxorubicin-induced cell death (Figure 4C). Similarly,
the HepG2 cells with knockdown were sensitized to
doxorubicin-induced cell death (Figure S6B). Additionally,
inhibition of autophagy with CQ potentiated doxorubicininduced cell death in HepG2 cells (data not shown),
further suggesting that autophagy may have a protective
effect against doxorubicin toxicity.

Doxorubicin induces autophagy in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells.

Rg3 sensitizes doxorubicin-induced cell death via
suppression of autophagic flux.

Several studies have suggested that modulation
of autophagy can sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage
agents [40, 41]. Since our data suggest that Rg3 treatment
can suppress autophagic flux, we investigated whether
Rg3 treatment could sensitize to cancer cell death induced
by DNA damage. Doxorubicin is a commonly used
anticancer drug that causes DNA damage and kills cancer
cells mainly by apoptosis [42]. However, doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity is also associated with the depletion
of a variety of long- and short-lived proteins [43-48],
indicating an activation of protein degradation systems
including the ubiquitin proteasome system [49, 50]. As
shown in Figure 3A and 3B, doxorubicin induced LC3 II
production and a decrease in p62 levels in a dose- and
time-dependent manner in SK-Hep1 cells. Moreover, CQ
further enhanced the amount of LC3 II in cells treated
with doxorubicin (Figure 3C), indicating that doxorubicin
caused increased autophagic flux. Similarly, doxorubicin
induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation (Figure 3D), further
indicating that doxorubicin is capable of inducing
autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

Our data suggest that autophagy serves as a prosurvival function in doxorubicin-induced cell death,
whereas Rg3 suppresses autophagic flux. We therefore
tested whether the suppression of autophagic flux by
Rg3 would sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma cells
to doxorubicin-induced cell death. Rg3 enhanced
doxorubicin-induced LC3 II levels (Figure 5A) and
GFP-LC3 puncta (Figure 5B) in a manner similar to
chloroquine (see previous figures), again suggesting
that Rg3 blocks doxorubicin-induced autophagic flux at
a late stage. When SK-Hep1 cells were pretreated with
Rg3 for 30 min followed by a low cytotoxic concentration
of doxorubicin for 18 h, cells underwent dramatic
sensitization to doxorubicin-induced cell death (Figure
5C). Similar results were obtained in HepG2 cells (Figure
S7). While both CQ and Rg3 could each sensitize cells to
doxorubicin on their own, the addition of CQ together with
Rg3 had no additional sensitizing effect on doxorubicininduced toxicity compared to Rg3 alone (Figure 5D, Figure
S7). This indicates that CQ and Rg3 sensitize cells to
doxorubicin largely though the same mechanism, although
addition of Rg3 gave some slight additional doxorubicin
sensitization compared to CQ alone (Figure 5D, Figure
S7). Collectively, these results indicate that autophagy
plays a pro-survival role in doxorubicin-induced cell death
and that Rg3 is able to sensitize HCC cells to doxorubicininduced cell death in large part through the suppression
of autophagy. This sensitization was observed in all the
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines tested (Figure 5E),
but when the normal human liver cell line, HL 7702 was
treated with Doxorubicin and Rg3, no sensitization was
seen (Figure 5F), suggesting that Rg3 synergism with
doxorubicin is selective to cancer cells.

Autophagy induced by doxorubicin serves as a
pro-survival mechanism.
Next we sought to determine whether the
doxorubicin-induced autophagy serves as a pro-survival
or pro-death function in HCC cells, since some reports
have suggested that positive modulation of autophagy
is associated with increased doxorubicin toxicity [51].
We therefore made stable shRNA cell lines in SK-Hep1
(Figure 4) and HepG2 (Figure S6) cells with the double
knock-down of Beclin-1 and ATG5 or Beclin-1 and
Vps34. Knock-down was confirmed by western blotting in
the SK-Hep1 (Figure 4A) and HepG2 (Figure S6A) cells.
Rapamycin-induced autophagy was inhibited in double
knock-down cells as evidenced by the lack of Green
or Red puncta formation in the tandem labeled LC3transfected knockdown cells (Figure 4B). Suppression of
autophagy by Beclin-1/ATG5 or Beclin-1/Vps34 knockdown in SK-Hep1 cells augmented doxorubicin-induced

minimal amount of caspase-3 cleavage was seen in some
of the dying cells treated with Rg3 and doxorubicin when
compared to the TRAIL induced caspase-3 cleavage
(Figure S8A). However, some PARP cleavage could be
detected in HepG2 and Huh-7, but in not SK-Hep1 cells,
suggesting some caspase activity is present (Figure S8A).
However, consistent with limited evidence for caspase
activation, when the three cell types were treated with a
general caspase inhibitor (zVAD-FMK), zVAD had only
a slight effect on cell death induced by the combination
of Rg3 and doxorubicin (Figure 6A), indicating that the
cells were primarily dying a caspase-independent cell
death. Since we observed little caspase activation, and
since Rg3 has been previously reported to induce caspase
activation in the colon cancer cell line HT-29 [52], we
tested the Rg3 and doxorubicin combination in this cell
line to see if caspase activation would be more prevalent
in this cell type. We were unable to detect either PARP
or caspase-3 cleavage in these cells, and zVAD likewise
failed to protect the cells from cell death (Figure S8B-C).
Thus, Rg3 and doxorubicin- induced cell death seems to

be a largely a caspase-independent process. Interestingly,
the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1, which is inhibitor of
programmed necrotic cell death [53, 54], was also unable
to block cell death by combination of Rg3 and doxorubicin
(Figure S8D), thus suggesting that necroptosis also did
not substantially contribute to cell death in this system.
Consistent with this lack of effect of necrostatin, all of the
HCC cell lines that we used lacked expression of RIP3
(Figure S8E), an essential component of the necroptotic
machinery.
To determine whether changes in gene expression
were required for the ability of Rg3 to inhibit autophagy,
we pre-treated cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to
inhibit protein synthesis, before inhibiting autophagy.
A slight amount of autophagy was induced by CHX
addition. While bafilomycin A1 was capable of inhibiting
autophagy in CHX-treated cells as shown by a decreased
mCherry/GFP fluorescence ratio in Rg3 pretreated cells
(Figure S9A), when cells were treated with CHX, Rg3
could no longer shift the mCherry/GFP fluorescence ratio
(Figure S9B). This suggests that gene expression changes

are necessary for Rg3 to inhibit autophagy. We have
previously shown that Rg3 sensitizes to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by inducing the expression of the transcription
factor CHOP, which then upregulates the transcription of
the DR5 receptor for TRAIL [22]. However, CHOP has
also been shown to modulate autophagy, and in some cases
appears to act as a repressor autophagy [55, 56]. To test
whether induction of CHOP is required for Rg3 inhibition
of autophagy, we knocked down CHOP in HepG2 cells
and treated the cells with Rg3. Knock-down of CHOP
led to increased basal levels of LC3II (Figure S9C). In

the absence of CHOP, Rg3 treatment did not result in any
addition increase of LCII, suggesting that Rg3 may inhibit
autophagy at least in part through CHOP upregulation
(Figure S9C). Knockdown of CHOP repressed the death
of HepG2 cells by the Rg3-doxorubicin combination at
early timepoints (Figure S9C), suggesting upregulation of
CHOP is necessary for Rg3 sensitization to doxorubicin.
However, unlike the potentiation of TRAIL signaling
by Rg3, the upregulation of DR5 was not necessary for
doxorubicin sensitization, and DR5 knockdown actually
increased doxorubicin cytotoxicity (Figure S9E).

a much less intense staining in the mice that were given
the Rg3-doxorubicin combination than in the other mice,
indicating a reduction of cell proliferation and less
angiogenesis in the tumor tissue from these mice (Figure
6D). TUNEL staining was highly evident in the Rg3doxorubicin combination when compared to the Rg3- or
doxorubicin- only groups. Taken together, these findings
suggest that Rg3 potently enhances the therapeutic activity
of doxorubicin in vivo by promoting cell death.

be mediated in part though activation of the CHOP
transcription factor. CQ and HCQ are currently being
investigated as primary or adjuvant therapies in more
than 30 clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, mostly
based on the premise that their anticancer properties are
the result of inhibition of autophagy (see http://www.
cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search/results?protocolsearch
id=9855259). HCQ and CQ have achieved favorable, but
inconsistent, results in inhibiting autophagy in patients
so far in phase I clinical trials [63]. The lack of CQ
effectiveness in some trials may not be because inhibiting
autophagy is not an effective strategy, but because CQ can
be neutralized at acidic pH, eliminating its effectiveness
in the hypoxic/acidic regions of tumors [64]. Therefore
other compounds may need to be developed for effective
inhibition of autophagy, and Rg3 may have the potential to
be developed into a novel cancer therapeutic agent based
on its ability to inhibit autophagy.
In this study we show that doxorubicin, a common
cancer therapeutic agent that induces DNA damage
[41], also induces autophagy, which plays a pro-survival
function. Our findings are consistent with several other
reports of doxorubicin-induced autophagy during cell
death induction. For instance, low doses of doxorubicin
have been recently shown to induce autophagy and
apoptosis simultaneously [51]. In multiple myeloma cell
lines, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition by knockdown
of Beclin-1 or Atg5, augments doxorubicin-induced
cell death [65, 66]. Our results show that inhibition of
autophagy by Rg3 markedly augments doxorubicininduced cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in
vitro and in vivo. Therefore, suppression of autophagy
could be an effective novel strategy in combination
therapy to overcome chemoresistance and enhance
chemotherapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, Rg3 could
potentially be further developed as an important autophagy
inhibitor to enhance anti-cancer efficacy of existing DNAdamaging or other chemotherapeutic agents.

DISCUSSION
It has been well established that autophagy
possesses important biological functions and is closely
implicated in oncogenesis and cancer development, where
it can act in both tumor suppressive and pro-metastatic
functions [57-60]. Suppression of autophagy has been
accepted as a novel therapeutic strategy in combination
cancer therapy [61], and may be especially useful in the
treatment of HCC [14, 15]. Currently, chloroquine and its
derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are the only FDA
approved drugs that are currently used in a clinical setting
for inhibition of autophagy. Therefore, novel autophagy
inhibitors for such combinational therapy in cancer are
currently highly sought after.
20(S)-ginsenosides, a class of steroid glycosides
and triterpene saponins, have been extensively studied as
the main active components of ginseng [62]. Anti-tumor
activity of the 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 has previously been
associated with reduction of angiogenesis associated
with down-regulation of VEGF expression [23, 24, 2628]. We did not observe much VEGF downregulation
in tumors from mice treated with Rg3 on its own,
suggesting a different mechanism of anti-tumor activity
in this case. Ginsenosides are able to affect multiple
signaling pathways, and their effects on autophagy have
remained uncharacterized. In the present study, we provide
evidence that Rg3 has an inhibitory effect on autophagy
that is functionally related to its sensitization effect on
doxorubicin-induced cell death. Rg3 suppresses autophagy
at a late stage via inhibition of the maturation, fusion, or
degradation stage. Although the underlying molecular
mechanisms for Rg3’s effects on autophagic flux remain
to be further investigated, the effect of Rg3 on autophagy
may be similar to that of CQ, which inhibits autophagy
late in the process by interfering with lysosomal function.
However, unlike CQ, the effect of Rg3 on autophagy
may require changes in gene expression, and this may

Flow cytometry autophagy assay

SK-Hep1, HepG2, A549, and H322 cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/
mL streptomycin. Huh-7 and Hep3B cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 µg/mL streptomycin. Atg5-/- MEFs and the Tet-off
Atg5 MEFs were provided by Dr. N Mizushima (Tokyo
Medical and Dental University). The normal liver cell
line HL-7702 was purchased from Shanghai Institute of
Cell Biology (Shanghai, China) and cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/
mL streptomycin.

For flow cytometric analysis, all cells were infected
with pBABE retroviruses encoding mCherry-GFPLC3 and selected for either puromycin or hygromycin
resistance. Flow cytometry was done using 488 and
561 nM lasers for red and green fluorophore excitation,
respectively. Fluorescent cell populations were originally
enriched after selection by sorting the cells for red and
green double positive cells on a Moflo XDP 100 machine
(Beckman Coulter). Analysis was done on a Gallios 561
machine (Beckman Coulter). Any non-viable cells were
excluded from analysis by gating on the appropriate
forward/side scatter profile. The mCherry/GFP signal ratio
of fluorescent cells was determined and then plotted as
a histogram by WinList (Verity Software House). Since
GFP is rapidly quenched by the low pH of the lysosome
when autophagosomes merge with them, while mCherry is
more stable to pH fluctuations, cells with high autophagy
flux will be less green and thus have a higher mCherry/
GFP ratio than cells with lower autophagic flux. Overnight
treatment of cells with chloroquine or Bafilomycin A1
was done as a control to show that the mCherry/GFP
fluorescence ratio properly decreased in the absence of
autophagic flux, while treatment with EBSS was done to
show that the ratio properly increased.

Western blot analysis
Upon treatment, cells were lysed in M2 buffer (20
mM Tris at pH 7, 0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM
EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 20 mM
β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 μg/mL
leupeptin). Equal amounts of cell extracts were resolved
by 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot
and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,
Amersham).

Cytotoxicity assay

Transfection

Cell death was determined using tetrazolium dye
colorimetric test (MTT test). The MTT absorbance was
then read at 570 nm. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
leakage was quantified using a cytotoxicity detection kit
(Promega). The LDH absorbance was then read at 490nm.
Representative images were taken by a phase-contrast
microscope and the data presented are from a minimum of
3 independent experiments.

Transfection experiments in hepatoma cells were
performed with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen,
11514) reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions
(GIBCO/BRL). Cells were transfected with the GFP-LC3
construct. The mRFP-GFP tandem fluorescent-tagged
LC3 construct (tfLC3) was provided by Dr. T Yoshimori
(Osaka University) [38].

Male nude mice from Central Lab. Animal Inc.
(Seoul, Korea) were fed standard rat chow and tap water ad
libitum, and were maintained under 12 h dark/light cycle
at 21 ºC. Male, 6-week-old nude mice were randomly
divided into four groups (control, Rg3, doxorubicin,
Rg3+doxorubicin, n=8/group). Huh-7 cells were harvested
and mixed with PBS (200 μL/mouse) and then inoculated
into one flank of each nude mouse (5 x 106 Huh-7 cells).
When the tumors had reached a volume of about 50-70
mm3, mice were given a daily oral dose of 20 mg/kg Rg3
or the vehicle (200 μL PBS, control group), and i.p. three
times/week at dose of 1 mg/kg doxorubicin, for 21 days,
respectively. The tumor dimensions were measured twice
a week using a digital caliper and the tumor volume was
calculated using the formula: V = length x width2 x 0.5.
Following the experiment, the mice were killed and the
tumors were excised and weighed. Histopathological
analysis for tumors was carried out by using hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining.
