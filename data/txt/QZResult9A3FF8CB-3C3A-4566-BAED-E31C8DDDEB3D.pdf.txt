Abstract

Author Manuscript

The metabolic functions of androgen receptor (AR) in normal prostate are circumvented in
prostate cancer (PCa) to drive tumor growth, and the AR also can acquire new growth-promoting
functions during PCa development and progression through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT, surgical or medical castration) is the standard treatment for
metastatic PCa, but patients invariably relapse despite castrate androgen levels (castration-resistant
PCa, CRPC). Early studies from many groups had shown that AR was highly expressed and
transcriptionally active in CRPC, and indicated that steroids from the adrenal glands were
contributing to this AR activity. More recent studies showed that CRPC cells had increased
expression of enzymes mediating androgen synthesis from adrenal steroids, and could synthesize
androgens de novo from cholesterol. Phase III clinical trials showing a survival advantage in
CRPC for treatment with abiraterone (inhibitor of the enzyme CYP17A1 required for androgen
synthesis that markedly reduces androgens and precursor steroids) and for enzalutamide (new AR
antagonist) have now confirmed that AR activity driven by residual androgens makes a major
contribution to CRPC, and led to the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of both
agents. Unfortunately, patients treated with these agents for advanced CRPC generally relapse
within a year and AR appears to be active in the relapsed tumors, but the molecular mechanisms
mediating intrinsic or acquired resistance to these AR-targeted therapies remain to be defined.
This review outlines AR functions that contribute to PCa development and progression, the roles
of intratumoral androgen synthesis and AR structural alterations in driving AR activity in CRPC,
mechanisms of action for abiraterone and enzalutamide, and possible mechanisms of resistance to
these agents.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The standard systemic treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) since the 1940s has been
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT, surgical or medical castration) to suppress androgen
receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, but most patients relapse within several years with
disease that is generally more aggressive and is currently referred to as castration-resistant
PCa (CRPC). The past several years have seen a paradigm shift in therapy for CRPC, as it is
now widely accepted that the AR is active and stimulating the growth of these cancers that
relapse despite castrate levels of androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone).
Historically, studies from many groups had indicated that AR was reactivated in CRPC, and
that it was driven at least in part by residual steroid hormones from the adrenal glands.
Indeed, during the late 1940s and 1950s adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy were shown to
1
be effective secondary hormonal therapies for men who relapsed after orchiectomy. These
surgical approaches were subsequently replaced by medical therapies such as prednisone
and ketoconazole that suppressed adrenal androgen synthesis, which were similarly effective
in a subset of patients based on clinical and biochemical criteria (decrease in serum prostate2 4
specific antigen (PSA)). – Based on the hypothesis that residual androgens were still
driving AR after castration, clinical trials were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s to
determine whether the efficacy of castration (orchiectomy or GnRH agonist) could be
improved by addition of a direct AR antagonist (flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide) to
56
block the effects of residual androgens. , While meta-analyses of these studies showed a
survival benefit for the combined therapies, the magnitude of the benefit was very small and
enthusiasm for further therapies beyond castration to suppress AR waned.

Author Manuscript

Despite these disappointing clinical results, immunohistochemical and molecular studies on
patient samples in the 1990s showed that AR was highly expressed and transcriptionally
7 10
active (based on high-level expression of AR-regulated genes such as PSA) in CRPC. –
11
Moreover, AR gene amplification in CRPC, and the identification of ARs with gain of
function mutations in AR antagonist-treated patients that could be strongly activated by the
8 12
antagonists, , showed that these tumors were under strong selective pressure to maintain
AR activity. Subsequent studies in xenograft models similarly showed increased AR and
13 15
restoration of AR activity in tumors that relapsed after castration, – and RNA interference
and related approaches established that AR was still required for growth in these CRPC
16 17
models. , Studies showing relatively high levels of androgens in CRPC samples from
18 20
patients, – in conjunction with studies showing that these tumors had increased
10 20
expression of androgen synthetic enzymes, , established androgen synthesis by tumor
21
cells as a mechanism for AR reactivation in CRPC.

Author Manuscript

Most recently, phase III clinical trials of abiraterone (inhibitor of the enzyme CYP17A1
required for androgen synthesis) and enzalutamide (more effective direct AR antagonist) in
CRPC established that further AR suppression can extend patient survival, and led to Food
22 24
and Drug Administration approval of these agents. – Unfortunately, while the majority of
patients who have relapsed after castration respond initially to these agents, the overall
survival advantage in advanced disease (post chemotherapy) is still modest (4–6 months),
and most responding patients relapse within 1–2 years with evidence of renewed AR
activity. In order to build on these recent advances in AR-targeted therapies for PCa, it is

clearly critical to better understand the critical functions of AR and mechanisms mediating
its reactivation, and to develop strategies that can overcome these mechanisms. This review
focuses on AR functions in PCa and mechanisms of action and resistance to agents targeting
AR in CRPC.

AR STRUCTURE AND NORMAL FUNCTION AS A TRANSCRIPTIONAL
ACTIVATOR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The AR is a transcription factor with a large N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD) (exon
1), a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (exons 4–8), a central DNA-binding domain
(DBD) (exons 2–3), and a hinge region between the DNA-binding domain and LBD that
contributes to nuclear localization and degradation (Figure 1). The unliganded AR associates
with an HSP90 chaperone complex in the cytoplasm and undergoes proteasome-mediated
degradation in the absence of ligand. Similarly to other nuclear receptors, binding of agonist
ligands (testosterone or dihydrotestosterone) causes a shift in the position of helix 12 in the
AR LBD towards helices 3–5, which stabilizes ligand binding and generates a hydrophobic
cleft for binding of leucine-x-x-leucine-leucine (LxxLL) motifs found in many
25 26
transcriptional coactivator proteins. , A unique feature of AR is that an LxxLL-like motif
in the AR N terminus (amino acids 23–27, FQNLF) binds to this hydrophobic cleft, which
27 28
further stabilizes helix 12 and ligand binding (AR–N–C terminal interaction). ,
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies show that this N–C interaction is initially
intramolecular in the cytoplasm, but shifts towards intermolecular in the nucleus and may
29 32
have some role in nuclear localization, although its precise function is not clear. –
Interestingly, fluorescence resonance energy transfer data also suggest that the N–C
interaction may be disrupted when AR binds chromatin, possibly in order to allow for
30
coactivator binding.

Author Manuscript

The agonist-liganded AR then translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes and binds to specific
sequences (androgen-responsive elements (AREs)) found in the regulatory regions of ARtarget genes. AR binding to these sites displaces a weakly associated central nucleosome and
is generally dependent upon prior binding of the transcription factor FOXA1, which has
been termed a ‘pioneer transcription factor,’ as it is needed to initially unwind the chromatin
33 34
around the ARE so it becomes accessible for AR binding. , The AR also undergoes
multiple post-translational modifications in response to agonist binding, including
35
phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation. These
modifications have roles in regulating AR stability, cellular localization and transcriptional
activity, although the precise mechanisms by which many of these modifications modulate
AR structure and interactions with other proteins or DNA remain to be determined (see
below). A series of transcriptional coactivator/chromatin-modifying proteins are then
recruited through interactions with the AR NTD and LBD. This complex of proteins
recruited by AR then interacts by chromatin looping with the promoter regions to stimulate
36 37
the transcription of a large number of AR-regulated genes. ,
Consistent with the normal function of androgens in the prostate being to drive the
differentiated functions of luminal epithelial cells, these AR-stimulated genes include

seminal fluid proteins (such as prostate-specific antigen) and multiple genes in metabolic
38 39
pathways required to support high levels of protein and lipid synthesis. , Significantly,
while androgens can clearly stimulate PCa growth, and androgen deprivation causes a
40 41
G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, , most genes driving cell cycle progression in response to
androgen do not appear to be directly regulated by AR. One mechanism mediating the cell
cycle progression in response to androgens is an increase in TORC1 activity and subsequent
39
TORC1-mediated increase in the translation of D-cyclins. The decrease in TORC1 activity
after androgen deprivation and the increase in TORC1 activity in response to androgen likely
reflect the ability of AR to stimulate cellular metabolism by increasing the expression of
multiple membrane transporters and other genes driving lipid and protein synthesis (see
above).

Author Manuscript

Androgen deprivation also increases levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27,
40 42
while androgen stimulation promotes the rapid degradation of p27. , Recent data indicate
that the rapid p27 degradation reflects androgen stimulation of TORC2, the subsequent
phosphorylation and activation of AKT, and phosphorylation of p27 by AKT at a site that
43
enhances p27 degradation (threonine 157). The androgen-mediated stimulation of TORC2
appears to be independent of transcription, but its mechanism remains to be determined.
Interestingly, this AKT site on human p27 is not conserved in the mouse, and a recent study
using a tetracycline-inducible myristoylated-AKT indicated that AKT-driven proliferation in
44
mouse prostate epithelium is independent of p27 degradation. These observations suggest
that studies in mouse models may underestimate the oncogenic activity of PI3 kinase/AKTpathway activation.

Author Manuscript

In contrast to p27, the agonist-liganded AR binds to a site on the cyclin-dependent kinase
45
inhibitor p21 gene and directly increases p21 transcription and protein expression. As p21
can, in some contexts, stimulate cell cycle progression by increasing assembly of cyclin D/
CDK4 complexes, this may be a mechanism that contributes to androgen-stimulated PCa
growth. Finally, it should be noted that AR is also weakly expressed by subsets of cells in
the prostate stroma, and that AR in these cells can stimulate the expression of growth factors
46
such as KGF/FGF7. Through this mechanism, AR in stromal cells may indirectly regulate
growth of the epithelium, and loss of these stromal factors likely contributes to prostate
involution after castration.

AR FUNCTION AS A TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR

Author Manuscript

In addition to its well established function as a transcriptional activator, gene expression
studies from many groups have shown that expression of multiple genes is decreased in
response to androgen. For many of these androgen-repressed genes, this is likely secondary
to transcriptional effects on other genes. However, AR can repress the expression of some
genes more directly through interactions with other transcriptional activators or by
functioning as a transcriptional repressor. The most studied example of the former
mechanism is AR interaction with SP1, which can interfere with SP1-mediated
47 48
transactivation of genes including the luteinizing hormone β-subunit and c-MET. , Other
transcription factors that may be similarly antagonized through interaction with the agonist49
liganded AR include RUNX2, JUN and SMAD3. Moreover, AR binding of β-catenin,

which is a critical coactivator for the T-cell factor transcription factors that mediate
50 55
canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, may suppress this pathway. –

Author Manuscript

The agonist-liganded AR also may function more directly as a transcriptional repressor by
56 61
recruiting corepressors including ALIEN, DAX1, HEY, AES, PHB and SHP. – However,
more studies are needed to address whether these corepressors are targeted to AR on a
specific set of genes, and whether any such targeting is determined by features of the ARE
or by other mechanisms. The corepressors, NCoR and SMRT, which associate strongly with
the LBD of unliganded nonsteroid nuclear receptors and mediate their transcriptional
repression functions, can also associate weakly with the agonist-liganded AR (probably
62 65
through the AR NTD) (Figure 1). – In the absence of ligand, nonsteroid nuclear receptors
still bind chromatin and the coactivator-binding site in their LBD is enlarged (due to
displacement of helix 12), allowing them to accommodate extended LxxLL-like motifs
(CoRNR boxes) in NCoR and SMRT. While the effects of NCoR and SMRT on the agonistliganded AR are modest, their enhanced recruitment may contribute to the activity of some
AR antagonists (see below). Finally, androgen-mediated transcriptional repression has been
linked to AR recruitment of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase and component of the
66 67
polycomb-repressive complex 2, which increases the repressive H3K27me3 mark. ,

Author Manuscript

Recent studies have shown that AR also associates with a histone demethylase, lysinespecific demethylase 1 (LSD1, KDM1A), and that LSD1 can function both as a coactivator
68 70
and corepressor for AR. – LSD1 was identified initially in corepressor complexes and
shown to function as a transcriptional corepressor by demethylating mono- and dimethylated
lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me1,2) (due to its catalytic mechanism, LSD1 cannot
71
demethylate trimethylated lysines). However, it was subsequently shown that LSD1, when
associated with AR and possibly other transcription factors including ERa, can function as a
transcriptional coactivator and mediate demethylation of repressive mono- and dimethylated
68 72 75
H3K9. , – Indeed, ChIP studies have shown that LSD1 is localized to androgenresponsive elements in multiple androgen-stimulated genes, and that LSD1 inhibition
68 69
markedly attenuates androgen-stimulated expression of these genes. ,

Author Manuscript

In contrast to LSD1 function as a coactivator for androgen-stimulated genes, it functions as
an AR corepressor on androgen-repressed genes including the AR gene. A recent study
showed that the agonist-liganded AR functions directly as a transcriptional repressor on the
70
AR gene by binding to a site in the second intron of the AR gene, where it recruits LSD1.
Significantly, androgen-mediated AR and LSD1 binding to this site was associated with
demethylation of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and LSD1 knockdown or inhibitors prevented
this demethylation and downregulation of AR gene expression. Together these findings
suggest that a switch in LSD1 substrate specificity from H3K4 to H3K9 may mediate its
functions as an AR corepressor versus a coactivator, respectively. Recent studies indicate
that phosphorylation of histone 3 on threonine 11 (H3T11ph) by an AR-associated serine/
threonine kinase, protein kinase C-related kinase 1 (PRK1, PKN1) enhances the ability of
76
LSD1 to demethylate repressive H3K9me1,2. Moreover, phosphorylation of histone 3 on
threonine 6 (H3T6ph) by a distinct kinase (protein kinase C β1, PKCβ1) was found to
77
suppress the LSD1-mediated demethylation of H3K4me1,2. These results suggest that the
dual recruitment of PKN1 and PKCβ1 by AR at androgen-stimulated genes may switch

Yuan et al.

Author Manuscript

LSD1 substrate specificity from H3K4 to H3K9 (Figure 1). However, it should be
emphasized that LSD1 mediates some degree of both H3K4 and H3K9 demethylation at
70
androgen-repressed and -activated genes, and that alterations in H3K4 and H3K9
methylation may be the result of alterations in transcription rather than being causal.
Therefore, further mechanisms are likely contributing to the activities of AR and LSD1 on
androgen-stimulated versus -repressed genes.

Author Manuscript

In addition to the AR gene, androgens similarly repress the expression of at least two
enzymes mediating androgen synthesis in prostate cells (AKR1C3 and HSD17B6) by this
70 78
LSD1-dependent mechanism. , This is consistent with a physiological negative feedback
loop that can adjust AR levels and intracellular androgen levels to maintain AR signaling in
response to fluctuations in serum androgen levels. By rapidly increasing AR gene
transcription and androgen synthesis, this feedback loop may be a mechanism that helps PCa
cells initially to adapt to ADT. Significantly, androgen-repressed genes are also highly
enriched for genes that mediate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, with at least a
70
subset being repressed by an LSD1-dependent mechanism. This result is consistent with a
normal physiological role of AR being to drive differentiation rather than proliferation, and
with previous studies showing that androgens, particularly at higher concentrations, can
70
suppress rather than stimulate growth of PCa cells. The androgen repression of these genes
mediating DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression is presumably overridden in PCa by
other oncogenic signal-transduction pathways that strongly activate these genes.

Author Manuscript

These dual functions of AR as a transcriptional activator and repressor have important
implications for ADT (Figure 2). PCa cells may initially respond to androgen deprivation
due to the central role of AR in regulating metabolic functions, so that androgen deprivation
essentially starves the cells and represses pathways including TORC1. However, androgen
deprivation may also allow cells initially to maintain a low level of AR activity by increasing
AR gene transcription and androgen synthesis. Tumor cells then further adapt over time and
partially restore AR signaling, based on mRNA levels for AR-regulated genes in CRPC
10 79
clinical samples. , These levels are presumably adequate to support critical metabolic
functions, but not adequate to impair the expression of AR-repressed genes mediating
androgen synthesis, DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Significantly, high levels of
androgen can repress these genes and arrest tumor growth in some CRPC cell line and
70
xenograft models, but the efficacy of this approach in patients is unclear and would likely
be limited by tumor heterogeneity. Nonetheless, these findings support the development of
novel AR antagonists or other agents that can selectively impair AR transcriptional activator
functions, and/or enhance its repressor functions, as these may be efficacious in CRPC.

NOVEL AR FUNCTIONS IN PCA DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION TO
CRPC
The identification of frequent fusions between the strongly AR-regulated TMPRSS2 gene
and the Ets family transcription factor ERG gene, as well as additional fusions involving
TMPRSS2 or other AR-regulated genes, established that AR acquires new functions in
80
PCa. Reported downstream functions of ERG in PCa include increased invasion, increased

expression of EZH2 and down-regulation of AR expression and transcriptional activity. ,
However, while it appears clear that ERG contributes to PCa development, the relevant
downstream effectors and functions of ERG in PCa have remained to be established. A
recent study found that the SOX9 transcription factor, which regulates ductal morphogenesis
83 86
in fetal prostate and maintenance of stem/progenitor cells in adult tissues, – is a
87
downstream effector of ERG in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive PCa. Specifically, ERG in
PCa cells binds to a site 3′ of the SOX9 gene and opens a cryptic AR-binding site, so that
androgens strongly stimulate SOX9 in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive PCa cells both by
driving ERG expression and directly through this ERG-dependent AR-regulated enhancer in
the SOX9 gene (Figure 3). Further studies showed that SOX9 mediates the increased
invasion downstream of ERG in vitro, and that SOX9 knockdown could markedly impair the
87
in vivo growth of PCa cells expressing the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene. In genetically
engineered mouse models, SOX9 knockdown impairs PCa development driven by MYC and
83
SV40 T antigen, while SOX9 overexpression in prostate on a Pten −/+ background results
87 88
in high-grade dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive PCa in a subset of mice. ,

Author Manuscript

SOX9 is expressed at higher levels in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive versus -negative
87
PCa, but is also expressed in fusion-negative tumors where it may be regulated by
89 90
pathways including MAP kinase and Wnt/β-catenin. , SOX9 expression appears to be
90
further increased in CRPC, and higher levels of SOX9 in residual tumor correlated with
early relapse in a neoadjuvant clinical trial of androgen deprivation combined with docetaxel
91
and estramustine. Significantly, SOX9 expression is repressed by androgens in
TMPRSS2:ERG negative PCa cells and in mouse prostate after castration, so that androgen
87 88
deprivation may increase SOX9 in fusion-negative tumors. , This may have therapeutic
implications, as androgen deprivation combined with radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy
may be more effective in fusion-positive tumors expressing high levels of SOX9, that are
downregulated by castration, than in fusion-negative tumors. However, further studies are
needed to determine whether this increase in SOX9 after androgen deprivation is
biologically significant, and whether it affects responses to particular therapies.

Author Manuscript

Further studies using ChIP-seq methods coupled with gene expression microarrays to
comprehensively identify genes that are directly regulated by AR indicate that AR acquires
further new functions in CRPC. In particular, AR in CRPC cell lines was found to execute a
distinct transcriptional program that included the direct activation of a set of M-phase cell
37
cycle genes such as CDK1 and UBE2C that are overexpressed in CRPC. This
reprogramming could in part reflect novel intracellular AR ligands or distinct activities of an
unliganded AR, but increased H3K4 methylation at AR-binding sites in these genes suggest
a role for epigenetic alterations. Significantly, previous studies have indicated that AR
signaling, based on expression of genes that are normally stimulated by androgen, decreases
92
10 79 92
in higher Gleason grade tumors, and in CRPC. , , This is consistent with lower
androgen levels in CRPC, but may in addition reflect epigenetic reprogramming and
narrowing of the spectrum of genes that are AR regulated with tumor progression.
Most recently, EZH2 has been identified as an AR coactivator that may contribute to altering
93
AR function in CRPC. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase associated with the polycombrepressive complex 2 that is upregulated in CRPC, and had been presumed to be functioning

by progressive silencing of tumor suppressor genes though H3K27 trimethylation. However,
this recent study found that EZH2 forms a complex with AR in CRPC cells that is recruited
to the cis-regulatory elements of AR-target genes including CDK1 and UBE2C, and that it
functions as an AR coactivator on these genes by a mechanism that is dependent on its
93
methyltransferase activity, but independent of its ability to methylate H3K27. This AR
interaction and coactivator function of EZH2 is mediated by AKT-dependent
phosphorylation of EZH2 on serine 21, which also impairs its ability to methylate H3K27
and presumably directs it to one or more alternative substrates. Finally, recent data indicate
that AR splice variants lacking the LBD, which are increased in CRPC (see below), may
94
regulate a distinct set of genes that include genes driving cell cycle progression. These
findings could reflect novel interactions between AR splice variants and EZH2, but further
95 96
studies are needed to determine their molecular basis. ,

AR REACTIVATION IN CRPC AND RESISTANCE TO CYP17A1 INHIBITION
MEDIATED BY INTRATUMORAL ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS

Author Manuscript

The normal prostate has the enzymatic machinery to synthesize testosterone from serum
precursors supplied by the adrenal glands, and this testosterone is normally converted to the
higher affinity ligand dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductases (SRD5A1 and SRD5A2),
primarily the type 2 5α-reducatase (SRD5A2) in normal prostate (Figure 4). Intraprostatic
synthesis may not be a major source of androgen in men with intact testes and normal
21
circulating testosterone, but can become a substantial source after ADT. Indeed, several
studies have shown that intraprostatic androgen levels do not decline as markedly as serum
97 101
levels after ADT. – Moreover, an analysis of AR-regulated gene expression in
prostatectomy specimens in patients receiving neoadjuvant (treatment prior to
prostatectomy) ADT found that while several androgen-regulated genes (NDRG1, FKBP5,
102
and TMPRSS2) were reduced, many others were not suppressed. Taken together, these
data demonstrated that intraprostatic androgen synthesis can be a significant source of
androgen and may buffer primary PCa against the acute effects of ADT.

Author Manuscript

Early studies examining intraprostatic androgen levels in men with CRPC and intact
103 104
prostates suggested that androgen synthesis may be further increased, , and recent
studies using more reliable mass spectrometry methods have now clearly established that
intraprostatic androgen levels in men with CRPC are not substantially reduced relative to
18 19
levels in eugonadal men. , Moreover, a study in metastatic CRPC samples showed that
androgen levels in many of the CRPC samples were actually increased relative to control
tissues, indicating that the progression to CRPC was associated with increased intratumoral
20
accumulation or synthesis of androgen. In parallel with these assessments of androgen
levels, gene expression studies in CRPC bone marrow metastases identified increased
expression of enzymes mediating androgen synthesis from weak adrenal androgens as a
molecular mechanism mediating the restoration of androgen levels in CRPC, with the largest
increases being in the levels of AKR1C3 mRNA, which reduce androstenedione to
testosterone (approximately five-fold median increase, with marked increases in
10
approximately one-third of cases). This study also found significant increases in type 1
10
SRD5A and in HSD3B2, which converts DHEA to androstenedione. Subsequent studies in

CRPC clinical samples have similarly found increased expression of enzymes mediating
20 105 106
androgen synthesis, including AKR1C3 and SRD5A1. , ,

Author Manuscript

CRPC cells also may have increased expression of enzymes mediating cholesterol and fatty
acid synthesis, which may be driven by increased SREBP activity and is consistent with
9 107
their enhanced lipid synthesis. , However, while it now appears clear that PCa cells adapt
to ADT by enhancing their ability to metabolize weak androgens produced by the adrenal
glands, whether they can synthesize physiologically significant amounts of androgen de
novo from cholesterol has been less clear. Studies conducted primarily in LNCaP cells and
xenografts showed that enzymes required for de novo steroid synthesis (including
CYP17A1, the enzyme that catalyzes 2 steps in androgen synthesis to generate DHEA, see
Figure 4), were increased in castration-resistant sublines and could generate detectable levels
108 110
of androgens. – However, studies in CRPC clinical samples have not consistently found
10 20 105
increases in these enzymes. , , More recent studies in CRPC cell line and xenograft
models have now confirmed that PCa cells can generate androgens de novo from cholesterol
78 111
at levels that are adequate to drive AR transcriptional activity and tumor growth. ,
Significantly, AR activity and growth of these CRPC xenografts could be suppressed by the
CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone, and CYP17A1 mRNA was increased in xenografts that
progressed after initial responses. Moreover, CYP17A1 mRNA also appeared to be
increased in a small set of CRPC clinical samples from patients treated with a CYP17A1
78
inhibitor.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Taken together, these findings suggest that CYP17A1-dependent de novo androgen synthesis
may not be a major mechanism driving AR in tumors that relapse after standard ADT, where
there are very high serum levels of precursor steroids that can be taken up by the tumor cells
and converted to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. However, this mechanism may
become more important in patients treated with abiraterone or other CYP17A1 inhibitors
that markedly decrease adrenal gland synthesis of precursor steroids. While abiraterone
would presumably also be targeting CYP17A1 and androgen synthesis in tumor cells,
relative resistance could emerge through mechanisms including CYP17A1 overexpression or
mutations, increased synthesis of upstream substrates (possibly including novel substrates
that may have higher affinity for CYP17A1 and be metabolized through alternative
pathways), or increased drug metabolism or efflux (Figure 4). Alternatively, as abiraterone
does not completely ablate serum precursor steroids (particularly DHEA-S, which is still
present at substantial levels and can be transported and metabolized to DHEA by steroid
sulfatase in PCa cells), tumor cells may adapt by further enhancing their ability to take up
and metabolize steroid precursors downstream of CYP17A1. Further studies of clinical
samples from CRPC patients with intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to CYP17A1
inhibitors will be critical to determine the role of these and other (see below) resistance
mechanisms and to assess therapies targeting these mechanisms.

STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS IN AR-MEDIATING RESISTANCE TO
CASTRATION AND CYP17A1 INHIBITION
11

Increased AR expression as a result of AR gene amplification, or other mechanisms that
70 112
increase AR gene transcription in CRPC, , can clearly contribute to increasing AR
responses to low levels of androgen. Mutations in the AR LBD can alter its structure so that
it is activated by alternative ligands including progesterone, hydrocortisone, estradiol and
8 12 113 115
certain AR antagonists. , , – These latter mutations are found at increased frequency
in patients treated with the AR antagonists flutamide (codons 874 and 877) and bicalutamide
12 116
(codon 741), but are uncommon in patients treated with medical or surgical castration. ,
However, as serum levels of progesterone and other upstream steroids are increased in
patients treated with CYP17A1 inhibitors, mutant ARs that are activated by these upstream
78
steroids may emerge as an important resistance mechanism.

AR splice variants that have lost the LBD, and are therefore constitutively active in the
117 123
absence of ligand, also have been identified in CRPC. – In the majority of these
variants, exon 3 (encoding the 3′ end of the DNA-binding domain) is spliced to a cryptic
exon in the intron between exons 3 and 4, while exon 4 is spliced out of frame to exon 8 in
another major variant. Based on mRNA levels, these variants generally appear to be
expressed at low levels relative to the full length AR, and the extent to which they contribute
to AR activity in CRPC (either as homodimers or as heterodimers with full length AR) is not
yet clear. However, they can be expressed at high levels and drive androgen-independent
growth in cells with deletions in the AR locus that impair expression of the full length
96 124
AR. , Therefore, it seems likely that genetic or epigenetic mechanisms mediating
expression of AR variants at levels that can contribute substantially to AR-pathway
reactivation will emerge as a resistance mechanism in response to agents that markedly
deplete androgens such as CYP17A1 inhibitors or to novel AR antagonists targeting the
96 111
LBD (see below). , AR antagonists that target the NTD are currently being developed
125
and may be active against these variants.

Studies from many groups have identified post-translational modifications (serine/threonine
phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation and
sumoylation) of AR that can enhance AR activity in response to low levels of androgens,
and may thereby contribute to AR reactivation in CRPC and to intrinsic and/or acquired
35
resistance to CYP17A1 inhibitors. Proteins mediating these modifications that may have
increased activity in CRPC include CDK1, AKT, SRC, ACK1, p38, JNK, RNF6 and SET9.
SRC and ACK1 have been reported to tyrosine phosphorylate AR at distinct sites on the
126 128
NTD and enhance AR transcriptional activity at low-androgen levels. – CDK1 activated
during M-phase phosphorylates serine 81 in the AR NTD, a site that is phosphorylated by
129 131
CDK9 during interphase and enhances AR transcriptional activity. – AKT can
132 135
phosphorylate serine 213, but the major kinase targeting this site may be PIM1. –
Phosphorylation of this site can mediate MDM2 binding and AR degradation, but this
appears to be context dependent and this site may also increase AR levels and modulate AR
132 134 136 138
nuclear localization. , , – Recent reports in PTEN-defficient mice indicate that PI3
kinase-pathway activation decreases AR expression, but the role of AR phosphorylation by

AKT in this model remains to be defined. , Phosphorylation of serine 650 in the AR
hinge region by p38 and JNK stimulates AR nuclear export, and dephosphorylation of this
141 142
site by PP1 can enhance AR nuclear retention. , The ubiquitin ligase RNF6 is increased
in CRPC and can enhance AR activity through non-lysine 48-linked polyubiquitylation,
143
which presumably modulates its interaction with other chromatin-associated proteins.
Finally, methylation of a site in the AR hinge region by SET9 can enhance the N–C terminal
144 145
interaction and may increase AR activity in CRPC. ,

Author Manuscript

Increased expression or activity of transcriptional coactivator proteins (including SRC2/
TIF2, which is amplified in a subset of PCa), or decreases in corepressor proteins, also may
146 150
enhance AR activity. – Further proteins that associate with AR and may modulate its
activity in CRPC include EZH2 and LSD1 (see above), and additional histone
69 151
methytransferases and demethylases. , Interestingly, exome sequencing indicates that
152 153
multiple chromatin-modifying enzymes are mutated in advanced CRPC, , suggesting
that AR activity in general, or on subsets of genes (such as M-phase genes, see above), may
be enhanced through changes in chromatin structure.

MECHANSIMS OF ACTION AND RESISTANCE TO AR ANTAGONISTS

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Nonsteroidal AR antagonists including bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide (active
metabolite of flutamide) bind to the steroid-binding pocket in the AR LBD and presumably
mediate an alternative conformational change that interferes with formation of the
coactivator-binding site (crystal structures of the wild-type AR LBD bound to antagonists
have not yet been obtained). Mutations in codons 874 or 877 alter the steroid-binding pocket
and allow hydroxyflutamide to generate an agonist confirmation and function as a strong
agonist, while a mutation in codon 741 similarly allows bicalutamide to function as a potent
26 154 155
AR agonist. , , Importantly, ChIP and FRAP studies have shown that bicalutamide can
still stimulate nuclear accumulation and binding of the wild-type AR to chromatin (although
more weak and transient binding compared to androgen), and that its antagonist activity
32 156 157
reflects ineffective recruitment of coactivator proteins. , , In contrast, enzalutamide
stimulates less nuclear accumulation of AR, and reporter gene and related studies show that
158
the enzalutamide liganded AR does not bind to chromatin (Figure 1). A sensitive
fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay indicates that this may reflect more effective
impairment of the AR–N–C terminal interaction, and possibly AR interaction with other
proteins. However, the precise basis for this loss of chromatin binding, which likely
contributes to the improved efficacy of enzalutamide versus bicalutamade in CRPC, remains
158
to be determined. Another AR antagonist related to enzalutamide that is currently in
159
clinical trials (ARN-509), as well as a series of recently reported unrelated AR
160
antagonists, similarly inhibit AR chromatin binding.
The agonist-liganded AR can also interact weakly with transcriptional corepressor proteins
including NCoR and SMRT, and RNA interference targeting NCoR and SMRT can enhance
androgen-stimulated AR transcriptional activity (see above). This AR interaction with NCoR
and SMRT appears to be mediated primarily by the AR NTD, as the agonist-liganded
coactivator-binding site in the AR LBD cannot accommodate the extended CoRNR boxes in
NCoR and SMRT that mediate binding to other unliganded nuclear receptors. ChIP studies

indicate that AR recruitment of NCoR and SMRT are increased by the AR antagonist
bicalutamide, which may reflect an alternative non-agonist conformation of the AR LBD
36 161 162
that can better accommodate CoRNR box binding. , , The interaction between AR and
64 65
NCoR/SMRT also can be further enhanced by mifepristone. , However, the extent to
which NCoR/SMRT recruitment contributes to the antagonist activity of bicalutamide is not
clear, as bicalutamide still functions as an AR antagonist in cells treated with NCoR and
163
SMRT small interfering RNA.

Author Manuscript

One study found that bicalutamide could function as an AR agonist in the setting of
inflammation due to NCoR/SMRT translocation out of the nucleus, but the extent of this
agonist activity and whether factors in addition to decreased nuclear NCoR/SMRT mediate
164
this activity are not clear. Bicalutamide also has detectable partial agonist activity in cells
14
that are transiently or stably overexpressing AR. However, this activity is very weak
compared to the potent activity mediated by true agonists or by bicalutamide-stimulated
Y741-mutant ARs, and bicalutamide still functions as an antagonist of androgen-stimulated
AR activity in cells that overexpress AR. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suggest that a
number of factors, including altered expression or post-translational modification of AR,
coactivators or corepressors, may enhance the very weak partial agonist activity of
bicalutamide adequately to achieve a threshold level of AR activity required to support
tumor growth. However, it remains to be determined whether bicalutamide resistance in
CRPC reflects bicalutamide function as an agonist for wild-type AR that can drive the
substantial AR reactivation in CRPC, versus lack of potency in competing for increased
intratumoral androgens, or other mechanisms. Mechanisms mediating intrinsic or acquired
AR-pathway resistance to enzalutamide remain to be determined, but similarly to
bicalutamide may include AR mutations, constitutively active AR splice variants lacking the
LBD (see above), or increased intratumoral androgens. Moreover, further novel mechanisms
may emerge that can drive chromatin binding by the enzalutamide liganded wild-type AR.

CONCLUSIONS

Author Manuscript

It is now apparent that increased intratumoral androgen synthesis and subsequent partial
restoration of AR transcriptional activity make a significant contribution to CRPC. To build
on the clinical success of abiraterone and enzalutamide, it will clearly be necessary to
identify and target mechanisms of resistance to these and related agents (and/or to employ
these agents earlier in the course of the disease). Multiple mechanisms may contribute to
restoration of AR activity after treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors, including further
increases in intratumoral androgen synthesis (de novo or from serum DHEA-S) and
alterations in AR or associated proteins that can enhance AR responses to very low levels of
ligand. The former mechanism may be addressed by targeting additional steps in androgen
synthesis or possibly by addition of an AR antagonist, while the latter may be addressed by
combination therapies with agents blocking kinase or other pathways that enhance AR
activity. Resistance to enzalutamide or other AR antagonists may be mediated by similar
mechanisms, or by mechanisms that stimulate partial agonist activity, and there is clear
interest in the development of additional antagonists that may circumvent these mechanisms
by enhancing AR degradation. As treatment with flutamide or bicalutamide selects mutant
ARs that are activated by these agents, it also is reasonable to assume that mutant ARs will

emerge that have decreased affinity or are stimulated by enzalutamide. The increased levels
of pregnanes in patients treated with CYP17A1 inhibitors may similarly select for AR
mutations (including those in codons 874 and 877) that enhance AR activation by
progesterone or other steroids upstream of CYP17A1. Increased expression of AR variants
lacking the LBD also may emerge as a significant mechanism of resistance to inhibitors of
steroid synthesis and to antagonists targeting the LBD, which should spur the further
development of agents targeting the AR NTD or DNA-binding domain. Finally, one can
anticipate that more effective targeting of AR will lead to the increased emergence of tumors
that are no longer dependent on AR, and that will require alternative therapeutic strategies.

AR structure and responses to binding agonist and antagonist ligands. Androgen binding
mediates a conformational change in the position of helix 12 in the LBD. Binding to an
FQNLF peptide in the NTD mediates an initial intramolecular N–C interaction, and a
subsequent intermolecular interaction may contribute to nuclear localization. AR then binds
to androgen-responsive elements at sites that are generally bound initially by the FOXA1
transcription factor, which has been termed a ‘pioneer transcription factor,’ as it opens
chromatin locally so AR can access the ARE. These sites also are generally marked by
H3K4me2 containing nucleosomes. AR binding displaces a weakly associated central
nucleosome, and initiates the assembly of multiple coactivator and chromatin-modifying
proteins that loop to the promoter to initiate transcription. LSD1 functions as a critical
coactivator for androgen-stimulated genes that is associated with H3K9me2 demethylation,
and corepressor for androgen-repressed genes that is associated with H3K4me2
demethylation, but the precise LSD1 mechanisms of action on androgen-stimulated versus repressed genes remain to be established. The bicalutamide-liganded AR associates more
transiently with chromatin, does not effectively mediate coactivator recruitment, and has
increased corepressor recruitment. The MDV3100 (enzalutamide) liganded AR localizes in
both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but does not detectably associate with chromatin, which
may reflect further displacement of helix 12 and abrogation of the N–C interaction.

Increased expression of androgen-repressed genes may contribute to PCa progression after
ADT. In the presence of testicular androgen, AR stimulates PCa growth through its positive
effects on metabolic genes while its repression of genes mediating DNA synthesis/cell cycle
progression is circumvented by activated oncogenic pathways. The initial response to ADT
reflects downregulation of metabolic pathways mediating lipid and protein synthesis, but an
undesirable effect is to relieve repression of the AR gene, and of genes regulating androgen
synthesis and DNA synthesis/cell cycle progression. In CRPC, mechanisms including
increased intratumoral androgen synthesis partially restore AR activity and its metabolic
functions, but this AR activity is not adequate to decrease expression of the androgenrepressed genes controlling functions that include DNA synthesis/cell cycle progression.

SOX9 is downstream effector of ERG and AR in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive PCa.
SOX9 expression can be stimulated by extracellular signals including FGFs and HGF
(mediated by their receptors and downstream ERK), and by WNTs though the canonical
WNT/β-catenin pathway. AR in fusion-negative cells binds weakly to a site 5′ of the SOX9
gene (S1 site) and can weakly repress basal SOX9 expression (possibly by displacing
positive transcription factors). In fusion-positive cells, ERG binds to a cryptic ARE 3′ of the
SOX9 gene, with subsequent binding of FOXA1 and strong androgen-stimulated SOX9
expression.
