ABSTRACT
Dysfunction of the NO/sGC/cGMP signaling pathway has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Therefore, agents stimulating cGMP
synthesis via sGC are important therapeutic options for treatment of PH patients. An
unwanted effect of this novel class of drugs is their systemic hypotensive effect. We
tested the hypothesis that aerosolized intra-tracheal delivery of the sGC stimulator
BAY41-8543 could diminish its systemic vasodilating effect.
Pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of BAY41-8543 after single intra-tracheal
delivery was tested in healthy rats. Four weeks after a single injection of monocrotaline
(MCT, 60 mg/kg s.c.), rats were randomized to a two-week treatment with either
placebo, BAY 41-8543 (10 mg/kg per os (PO)) or intra-tracheal (IT) instillation (3
mg/kg or 1 mg/kg).
Circulating concentrations of the drug 10 mg/kg PO and 3 mg/kg IT were
comparable. BAY 41-8543 was detected in the lung tissue and broncho-alveolar fluid
after IT delivery at higher concentrations than after PO administration. Systemic
arterial pressure transiently decreased after oral BAY 41-8543 and was unaffected by
intratracheal instillation of the drug. PO 10 mg/kg and IT 3 mg/kg regimens partially
reversed pulmonary hypertension and improved heart function in MCT-injected rats.
Minor efficacy was noted in rats treated IT with 1 mg/kg. The degree of pulmonary
vascular remodeling was largely reversed in all treatment groups.
Intratracheal administration of BAY 41-8543 reverses PAH and vascular
structural remodeling in MCT-treated rats. Local lung delivery is not associated with
systemic blood pressure lowering and represents thus a further development of PH
treatment with sGC stimulators.

INTRODUCTION

pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a
devastating disease with a poor prognosis [2]. Recently,
a new class of drugs has been proposed for treatment of
the disease - soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators.

Despite recent achievements in treatments [1],

Stimulation of sGC by nitric oxide results in an
enhanced production of the second messenger cGMP,
which regulates a plethora of physiologic processes
including vascular tone, fibrosis, proliferation,
inflammation, microvascular permeability and neutrophilendothelium interactions [3]. Chronic treatment with the
sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 has been demonstrated to
reverse hemodynamic and structural changes associated
with monocrotaline (MCT)- and chronic hypoxia-induced
experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggesting
a strong anti-remodeling potency of this class of drugs
[4]. In accordance with these findings, BAY 41-2272
demonstrated anti-proliferative effects on vascular
smooth muscle cells [5]. Thus, the new class of drugs
targets two key processes involved in the pathogenesis
of PAH: vasoconstriction and vessel remodeling. The
sGC stimulators (BAY 41-2272 and BAY 41-8543)
were less successful due to low efficacy and low oral
bioavailability [6, 7]. Riociguat (BAY 63-2521) is the
first sGC stimulator that has made a successful transition
from animal experiments to controlled clinical studies in
patients. Riociguat showed favorable drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetic profiles [8]. In different experimental
models of pulmonary hypertension, riociguat had
beneficial effects on pulmonary haemodynamics, right
heart hypertrophy and remodelling of the pulmonary
vasculature [9]. In phase III clinical trials, riociguat
demonstrated efficacy in patients with PAH and,

remarkably, also in patients with chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) [10, 11]. Recently,
riociguat (Adempas®) was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency for the treatment of these two forms of pulmonary
hypertension: inoperable, recurrent or persistent CTEPH
and PAH [12].
Experiments in animal models of PH have revealed
a strong systemic vasodilating effect of sCG stimulators in
lambs [13], mice and rats [14]. Even in patients, a decrease
in systemic arterial pressure was reported as a side effect
of riociguat [15].
A possible way to overcome the systemic
vasodilating effect would be a local delivery of the drug
into the lung. In fact, inhaled agonists of sGC induced
selective pulmonary vasodilation in a model of acute
pulmonary vasoconstriction [16]. The present study was
designed to investigate the question whether a long term
intra-tracheal administration of BAY 41-8543 would
be therapeutically efficient in a model of chronic PAH
while remaining a selective vasodilator for pulmonary
vasculature. The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug was
investigated after peroral (PO) and intra-tracheal (IT)
delivery. We examined acute and chronic hemodynamic
effects of intra-tracheal BAY 41-8543, and antiremodeling effects of the long-term administration of this
agent.

PO 10 mg/kg produced a 3 orders of magnitude lower
concentration of 1.0 ± 0.2 ng/mg lung tissue (Figure 1B).
Six hours after intratracheal application, the
compound was detected in BAL fluid where IT 3 mg/kg
demonstrated 3-fold higher concentration than IT 1 mg/kg.
After peroral administration, the substance concentration
in BAL fluid was below the limit of quantification of the

Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of
BAY 41-8543 after oral and intratracheal
administration
Peroral administration of 10 mg/kg of BAY 418543 resulted in the highest plasma concentrations 6 h
post-application (Figure 1A). In contrast, intra-tracheal
administration of 3 mg/kg provided stable plasma
concentration in magnitude comparable with that of
peroral administration (at 6h - 114.6 ± 31.9 ng/ml). The IT
dose of 1 mg/kg resulted in lower plasma concentrations
of the substance (at 6h - 11.5 ± 0.8 ng/mL).
In the lung tissue samples, IT 3 mg/kg produced
a local substance concentration of 5.0 ± 0.3 µg/mg lung

rats after IT instillation of the agent (Figure 2D). Notably,
chronic PO treatment with BAY 41-8543 did not result in
accumulation of its systemic hypotensive effect, as chronic
SAP measurements twice daily mornings and evenings
revealed similar pressures in PO and IT groups (Figure

RV

Heart remodeling of MCT rats (placebo group) was
reflected by RV hypertrophy and RV dilation (Figure 4A4C). Both, the hypertrophy and the chamber dilation were
ameliorated by treatment with 10 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543
PO and 3 mg/kg IT (Figure 4A-4C).
Echocardiography revealed impaired RV function
in placebo-treated rats, which was reflected by decreased
TAPSE and reduced cardiac index (Figure 4D and 4E).
Treatment with 10 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543 PO as well
as 3 mg/kg IT resulted in significant improvement of RV
remodeling and function (Figure 4A-4C). Treatment with
1 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543 IT had no effects on all of these
parameters (Figure 4).
MCT-induced PH resulted in cardiac remodeling
characterized by development of myocardial fibrosis
and myocyte hypertrophy. Both, fibrosis and myocyte
hypertrophy were suppressed by treatment with 10 mg/kg
of BAY 41-8543 PO and 3 mg/kg IT (Figure 4F-4H). In
contrast, IT treatment with 1 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543 had
only limited impact on all of these parameters.

Intratracheal BAY 41-8543 attenuates the
development of pulmonary hypertension and
pulmonary vascular remodeling
Twenty-eight days after injection of monocrotaline
(MCT) (placebo group), severe PAH developed with a
marked increase in RVSP and a decrease in PAAT (Figure
3). Both, PO treatment with 10 mg/kg and IT treatment
with 3 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543 significantly decreased
RVSP and increased PAAT. There was a non-significant
improvement in RVSP after IT instillation of 1 mg/kg of
BAY 41-8543.
Injection of MCT resulted in medial hypertrophy
and a pronounced increase in muscularization of the
distal pulmonary arteries (20-50 µm in diameter) after
28 days compared with pulmonary arteries from control
saline-injected rats (Figure 3A-3C). Treatment with
BAY 41-8543 both PO and IT at the dose of 3 mg/kg
significantly reduced the number of fully muscularized
pulmonary arteries and resulted in an increase of partially
muscularized pulmonary arteries compared with the
MCT-placebo group (Figure 3A-3C). Intratracheal
administration of 1 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543 resulted
in partial reduction of pulmonary vascular remodeling
(Figure 3A-3C).

Circulating and lung tissue concentrations of BAY
41-8543 after chronic treatment
After two weeks of treatment with BAY 41-8543,
plasma and tissue concentrations of the substance were
measured. Sample collection was performed at least 12
hours after the last drug application. In the PO treatment
group, the substance plasma concentration of 22.0 ±
6.1 µg/L was measured (Figure 5A). Interestingly, IT
treatment with 3 mg/kg resulted in a significantly higher
plasma concentration. Intratracheal treatment with 1 mg/

systemic arterial pressure

kg produced the substance plasma concentration of 5.3
± 2.0 µg/L. After chronic PO treatment, no measurable
levels of BAY 41-8543 were detected in lung tissue,
whereas IT drug application dose dependently generated a
local depot of the substance (Figure 5B).

Systemic hypotension is a consequence of
compromised hemodynamics and is a frequent condition
in PAH patients. In clinical studies, a dose dependent
systemic blood pressure lowering effect of riociguat
in PAH patients was observed [21]. This pressure
decrease can be critical in PAH patients by exacerbating
existing hypotension and causing syncope. Indeed,
hypotension developed in 10% of patients receiving
the highest tolerated dose of riociguat [10]. Potentially,
local administration of the substance could restrict the
vasodilating effect to the lung vasculature and avoid
systemic side effects. Indeed, a transient decrease in SAP
was observed after orally given 10 mg/kg of BAY 41-8543
in rats in our study. On the contrary, lowering of the SAP
was only marginal after IT application of the drug. These
findings are in line with the results of Evgenov et al., who
demonstrated selective pulmonary vasodilating effects of
inhaled sGC stimulators in the setting of acute PH [16].
Thus, inhaled delivery of the drug diminished systemic
side effect of the substance. Interestingly, while the effects
of PO 10 mg/kg and IT 3 mg/kg on the systemic pressure
are different, plasma concentrations of the substance
were comparable after single administrations. The most
probable explanation for this discrepancy is that the acute
blood pressure lowering effect is not only dependent on
the concentration of the drug in plasma but also on its local
tissue concentration. The arcade arteries of the mesenteric
vascular bed have been demonstrated to contribute
substantially to the control of peripheral resistance [22].
Indeed, perindopril injection reduced the systemic blood
pressure and to a greater extent the pressure in the arcade
arteries [23]. Potentially, orally delivered vasoactive
substances could build a tissue depot in the gastrointestinal tract and induce a preferential vasodilation of
the mesenteric arteries causing systemic hypotension. In
line with this, Sramek et al. have shown that a 125 mg of
intravenous (i.v.) captopril dose (a 10-fold higher dose)
was not more effective in blood pressure reduction than a
12.5 mg i.v. or a 25 mg PO dose [24].
One of the most frequently reported side effects of
sGC stimulators riociguat is systemic hypotension [11,
25]. As next, we sought to test whether chronic peroral
treatment with BAY 41-8543 could lead to accumulation
of its systemic hypotensive effect. For this purpose, SAP
was measured in chronically treated rats twice daily:
mornings - before drug administration and evenings eight to ten hours after drug administration. No significant
difference in SAP was observed between PO and placebo
groups. As expected, no systemic hypotension was
observed in IT groups. Thus, both PO and IT treatment
regimens are safe and do not induce accumulation of the
hypotensive effect with chronic drug administration.

DISCUSSION
Inhalation offers great potential for rapid delivery,
less degradation by drug-metabolizing enzymes, and high
bioavailability of small-molecule therapeutics [17]. In
addition, intrapulmonary administration of drugs in the
therapy of PAH provides selectivity of the hemodynamic
effects to the lung vasculature and reduces systemic effects
[18]. Prolonged retention of some hydrophobic drugs
in lung tissues has been demonstrated, explaining the
extended duration of effects of those drugs [19]. Against
this background, we sought to compare the effects of
peroral and intra-tracheal drug delivery. The key findings
of this study are as follows: 1. Chronic intra-tracheal
delivery of BAY 41-8543 could be as efficient as peroral;
2. Pulmonary selectivity of the vasodilation could be
achieved by the IT delivery of the drug.

Acute pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
Peroral BAY 41-8543 administration resulted in the
highest plasma concentrations 6 hours post-application.
Large tmax-values at high dosages are not uncommon. The
slightly lower concentration at 3 hours vs. 1 hour was
observed suggestive of double peak pharmacokinetics. For
the lipophilic substances, like BAY 41-8543, a possible
mechanism of the phenomenon could be the enterohepatic
recycling [20]. On the other hand, these data should not be
overinterpreted since only 3 concentration/time data points
were analyzed. Intra-tracheal administration of 3 mg/kg
provided a stable plasma concentration in the magnitude
comparable with that of peroral administration. A potential
explanation for the observed effect could be that IT
administration results in a better bioavailability of the
drug than the PO one [7]. The dosage IT 1 mg/kg resulted
in lower plasma concentrations of the substance. There
is a hint for a non-linear increase of exposure between 1
and 3 mg/kg IT. Intra-tracheal administration generated a
local depot of the substance. In the lung tissue samples,
IT 3 mg/kg produced a local substance concentration of
5.0 ± 0.3 µg/mg lung tissue, IT 1 mg/kg - 0.8 ± 0.1 µg/
mg lung tissue, whereas PO 10 mg/kg produced a 3 orders
of magnitude lower concentration of 1.0 ± 0.2 ng/mg
lung tissue. Thus, intra-tracheal delivery of BAY 41-8543
generates a local depot of the substance with constant
release into circulation.

Recent studies suggest that concomitant
administration of agents from two or more classes of drugs
is more effective in PAH patients [26]. Riociguat can be
used in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists
or prostanoids [10, 27]. However, combination of riociguat
with a standard dose of sildenafil showed no evidence of
a positive risk-benefit assessment, predominantly because
of a high rate of discontinuation due to hypotension in
long-term extension [28]. Our results indicate that IT
aerosolized delivery for this class of drugs could be an
alternative approach to limit its systemic effects. It is
tempting to speculate that the observed effect provides a
rationale for concomitant administration of aerosolized
formulations of sGC stimulators and other orally
administered vasoactive drugs for treatment of PAH to
enhance the pulmonary hypotensive effect while avoiding
systemic hypotension. In this regard, combination
of aerosolized formulations of sGC stimulators with
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may reduce the rate of
discontinuation due to hypotension. This hypothesis
warrants further investigations.

left ventricular hypertrophy have also been demonstrated
[33-35].
Chronic IT treatment in a dose of 1 mg/kg reduced
partially the degree of lung vascular remodeling as
reflected by decrease in medial wall thickness and in the
number of fully muscularized vessels. However, these
changes were insufficient to reduce RVSP. No effects on
cardiac remodeling were detected in IT 1 mg/kg group.
Probably, insufficient hemodynamic unloading and lower
circulating levels of the substance are responsible for the
absence of cardiac effects of the drug.
The advantage of the aerosolized drug delivery is
the possibility to generate locally high concentrations in
the lung. Indeed, significant levels of some drugs can still
be measured in the lungs up to 40 hours after IT dosing
[36]. Furthermore, very long duration of action has been
shown even for some drugs with a short half-life after
inhalative administration [37]. We interpret the results
that the long duration of action of our compound is due
to persistence of the active compound in the lung tissue.
Intra-tracheal drug delivery generates a tissue depot of the
substance distributed in different cell types, interstitial
space, and alveolar lining fluid. Therefore, the substance
concentration measurements from the whole tissue lysate
might not reflect the concentration of the substance in
the vascular smooth muscle cells, which is the efficient
concentration in the effector cells. Moreover, absorption
of therapeutic agents from the lungs can be prolonged
by a variety of mechanisms so that the effect can persist
over longer time thus decreasing the need for repeated
administrations of the drug [17].

Chronic effects of BAY 41-8543 on lung
vasculature and heart remodeling
We have previously shown anti-remodeling effects
on pulmonary vasculature after chronic treatment with
sGC stimulators [4, 29, 30]. In the current study, we found
that chronic treatment with BAY 41-8543 both PO and
IT at a dose of 3 mg/kg significantly reduced RVSP and
reversed vascular remodeling of the lung vasculature.
The most dangerous consequence of PAH is an impaired
cardiac function, which is a predictor of poor outcome [2].
We observed significantly remodeled RV and impaired
cardiac function in the placebo-treated MCT-rats. RV
hypertrophy was reversed and heart function improved in
MCT-rats that were treated with 10 mg/kg of BAY 418543 PO or 3 mg/kg IT. Cardiomyocyte enlargement and
increased interstitial fibrosis were present in MCT-rats
treated with placebo and were reversed by treatment with
BAY 41-8543 given PO at a dose of 10 mg/kg or IT at a
dose of 3 mg/kg.
In the groups, PO 10 mg/kg and IT 3 mg/kg,
reversal of RV hypertrophy and fibrosis can be explained
by hemodynamic unloading of the RV and probably
stimulation of the cGMP-signaling in the heart. Reduction
of the RV afterload can induce reversal of cardiac
remodeling as it has been demonstrated in patients with
PAH after isolated lung transplantation [31]. A direct
effect of the circulating substance is possible as plasma
concentrations of BAY 41-8543 were comparable between
the PO 10 mg/kg and IT 3 mg/kg groups. Anti-fibrotic
effect of pharmacological sGC stimulation on fibrosis in
pressure-overloaded rat heart has been reported [32]. Antihypertrophic actions of sGC stimulators in the models of

Study limitations
IT instillation of the substance in the surfactant
solution was used in our study with assumption that this
approach is similar to aerosolization. Potentially, our
approach could result in unequal drug deposition and
localized area of fluid overload. However, our control
experiments with dye delivery using the same vehicle
have demonstrated ubiquitous distribution of the dye
throughout the entire lung. Microscopic evaluation of the
lungs did not reveal any areas of pneumonia or atelectasis.
The MCT-induced PAH model used in our study
is often criticized because it does not fully mimic the
histopathology of the human disease [38]. Nevertheless,
the model recapitulates most of the relevant features of
the disease relevant to our study: pronounced increase in
lung vascular resistance, cardiac dysfunction, and decrease
in cardiac output.

Summary
Thus, chronic intra-tracheal administration of BAY
41-8543 reverses PAH and vascular structural remodeling

systemic hypotension, a significant side effect of oral
sGC stimulators. Our findings demonstrate a potential
for development of a new therapeutic approach for
treatment of PAH by inhalative administration of sGC
stimulators, which could provide pulmonary selectivity of
hemodynamic effects, and reduce systemic side effects.

e) IT 1 mg/kg - treated every second day with BAY
41-8543 (1 mg/kg) by IT instillation for 14 days (n = 10).
As oral and IT placebo groups were not different
from each other, their results were pooled and presented
as one placebo group. BAY 41-8543 was synthesized in
the laboratories of Bayer Pharma AG (Germany). The 10
mg/kg daily dose of BAY 41-8543 was chosen based on
previous studies [4]. The dose for IT delivery was selected
based on the previously described experience in transition
from PO to aerosolized drug delivery [40].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals

Intratracheal instillation

Adult Sprague Dawley rats (300-350 g body weight)
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld,
Germany). Local authorities approved the study protocol.

Oral endotracheal intubation of rats was performed
under isoflurane anaesthesia and then the active compound
or vehicle was instilled into the trachea under direct visual
control, as previously described [41]. Afterwards, rats
were allowed to recover while breathing 100% oxygen.

Acute pharmacokinetic study
For the acute pharmacokinetic study, rats received
one of the following treatments: a) PO placebo (400
µL of 2% methylcellulose solution) by gavage (n = 5);
b) IT placebo (400 µL of 0.2% surfactant solution)
by IT instillation (n = 5); c) BAY 41-8543 (10 mg/
kg) PO by gavage (n = 5); d) BAY 41-8543 (3 mg/kg)
by IT instillation (n = 5); e) BAY 41-8543 (1 mg/kg)
by IT instillation (n = 5). One, three, and six hours after
treatment, blood samples were collected from the vena
saphenous under anaesthesia with 3% isoflurane. Plasma
was obtained from the blood samples by centrifugation at
4 °C for 10 min at 1000g. Afterwards, rats were sacrificed
and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with 10
mL of isotonic saline solution. The BAL fluid (BALF) was
immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. After midsternal
thoracotomy pulmonary artery was canulated and flushed
with 15 mL of isotonic saline. Afterwards, the lung tissue
was harvested, immediately frozen, and stored at −80 °C.

Radiotelemetry
Systemic arterial pressure (SAP) was monitored
by an implantable telemetry system as described
previously [39]. PhysioTel® PA-C40 small animal pressure
transmitters (DSI International, Tilburg, Netherlands) were
implanted into the femoral artery under anesthesia (See
online supplement for details). Animals were allowed to
recover and were housed individually in standard rat cages.
The pressure signal was transferred to a remote receiver
(model RPC-1) and a data-exchange matrix connected to
a computer. After surgery, rats were allowed to recover for
3 days. The SAP stabilized in the first 24 hours. None of
the animals manifested signs of inflammation or infection.
Pressure measurements were started 30 min before drug
administration and continued for 24 hours thereafter.

Hemodynamic
measurements

Chronic treatment study

RV

hypertrophy

Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was
measured by a catheter inserted into the RV via the
right jugular vein, and for SAP the left carotid artery
catheterization was performed as described [39]. The heart
was dissected to separate the RV from the left ventricle
plus septum (LV+S), and the ratio RV/(LV+S) was
calculated as a measure of right ventricular hypertrophy
(See online supplement for details).

PAH was induced in adult Sprague-Dawley rats
by MCT injection as described previously in detail
[39]. Briefly, MCT (Sigma, Deishofen, Germany) was
administered as a single subcutaneous injection at a
dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. After 28 days, rats were
randomized into the following treatment groups:
a) PO placebo - treated once daily orally with 400

Measurement of the BAY 41-8543 concentration
in plasma, BALF, and lung tissue samples

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors would like to thank Ewa Bieniek and
Christina Vroom for expert technical assistance.

For pharmacokinetics study, the plasma samples,
lung tissue, and BALF samples were collected at indicated
time points (see section “Acute pharmacokinetic study”).
For measurements after chronic treatment, plasma and
lung tissue samples were collected next morning after
the last drug administration corresponding to 18-24 hours
post-administration.
The lung tissue was lyophilized and homogenized.
Lung tissue, BALF and plasma samples were treated
with acetonitril and ammoniumacetate-buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6.8). After centrifugation at 1000 g the supernatant
was subjected to LC-MS/MS for quantification of BAY
41-8543. Therefore, an Agilent 1100 HPLC with a flow
rate of 400 µL/min was used. A linear gradient on a Luna
5 µm C8(2) 100A 50x2 mm (Phenomenex) separation
column from 10 to 85% of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid was performed against a second mobile phase of
ammoniumacetate-buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.8). A TurboV
ionsource was used to transfer the eluate into the API4000
(AB Sciex) mass spectrometer. The lower limit of
quantification was 1 µg/L.
