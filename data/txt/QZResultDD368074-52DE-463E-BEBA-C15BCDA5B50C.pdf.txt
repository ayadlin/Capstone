ABSTRACT
Activation of the Hippo transducer TAZ is emerging as a novel oncogenic route in
breast cancer and it has been associated with breast cancer stem cells. Additionally,
TAZ expression has been linked with HER-2 positivity. We investigated the association
between TAZ expression and pathological complete response in HER2-positive
breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy.TAZ
was assessed in diagnostic core biopsies by immunohistochemistry. To categorize
samples with low TAZ and samples with high TAZ we generated a score by combining
staining intensity and cellular localization. The pathological complete response rate
was 78.6% in patients with low TAZ tumors and 57.6% in patients with high TAZ
tumors (p=0.082). In HER2-enriched tumors there was no significant association
between TAZ and pathological complete response, whereas in the luminal B subtype
the pathological complete response rate was 82.4% in tumors with low TAZ and
44.4% in tumors with high TAZ (p=0.035). This association remained statistically
significant when restricting our analysis to triple-positive tumors with expression of
both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor ≥ 50% (p=0.035). Results from
this exploratory study suggest that the TAZ score efficiently predicts pathological
complete response in Luminal B, HER2-positive breast cancer patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab.

INTRODUCTION

patient-derived CSCs and their differentiated counterparts
[8]. In an orthotopic mouse model we described the role
of TAZ as a mediator of breast CSC metastatic ability and
chemoresistance [8]. Moreover, in a preliminary analysis
conducted in the clinical setting we found a statistically
significant correlation between TAZ expression and
shorter disease-free survival in a consecutive series of
BC patients, and a positive correlation between TAZ and
HER2 positivity [8].
The robustness of our preclinical findings, along
with promising early clinical data, prompted this study
to explore the association between TAZ, evaluated in
diagnostic core biopsies, and pathological complete
response (pCR) in HER2-positive BC patients treated with
trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy.

The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved
regulator of tissue growth [1]. Mutations in Hippo
pathway components give rise to tissue overgrowth in
flies [2-3], and pathway defects have been associated with
tumorigenesis in mice [4]. In human cancer mutations
in core genes have rarely been detected in targeted and
whole-genome sequencing studies [1]. Nevertheless,
altered expression of different effectors has been found in a
wide variety of tumors [5], thus suggesting that disruption
of the Hippo signaling might result from the crosstalk with
other perturbed molecular networks. The main function
of Hippo pathway consists in negatively regulating two
homologous oncoproteins: the transcriptional co-activator
with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Yes-associated protein
(YAP). Attenuated Hippo signaling activates TAZ and
YAP, which in turn feed a variety of tumor-promoting
functions spanning from proliferation and cell survival
to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migration [1].
Moreover, Hippo-independent YAP/TAZ activation has
been described [6].
In breast cancer (BC), TAZ has also been linked
to cancer stem cells (CSCs) [7, 8], an uncommon
subpopulation of cancer cells characterized by increased
resistance to therapy-induced death stimuli [9]. Indeed,
it has been demonstrated that TAZ sustains self-renewal
and tumor-forming ability of breast CSCs [7]. We
have recently strengthened this association by using
molecularly characterized xenografts generated with

RESULTS
Data on demographics, clinical features,
therapy administered and treatment outcomes from 61
HER2-positive BC patients treated with neoadjuvant
trastuzumab-based therapy in three Italian Cancer Centers
were retrieved from our prospectively maintained database
and are illustrated in Table 1.
To investigate the relationship between TAZ and
pCR we generated a TAZ score that takes into account
its activation status, as detailed in the methods section.
We observed no association between standard clinicalmolecular factors and the TAZ score (Table 2), neither did

we observe any relationship between standard clinicalmolecular factors and pCR (Table 3).
Overall, forty-one (67.2%) patients achieved a pCR
(Table 4). In the whole cohort a pCR was recorded in
78.6% of patients with low TAZ tumors and in 57.6% of
patients with high TAZ tumors, even though this difference
was not statistically significant (p=0.082) (Table 4).
Neither the TAZ score nor the selected standard molecularclinical features showed evidence of a significant impact
on pCR in the univariate and multivariate logistic
regression models (Supplementary Table 1 and 2).
When stratifying by molecular subtype, we did
not observe any association between TAZ and pCR in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HER2-enriched tumors (Table 4). In this subtype, the
rate of pCRs was equal between cases with low TAZ
and cases with high TAZ. Conversely, in the luminal B
subtype the pCR rate was 82.4% in tumors with low TAZ
and 44.4% in tumors with high TAZ (p=0.035) (Table 4).
The association was confirmed by the regression model (≤
0.50 vs > 0.50 OR= 5.83; 95% CI, 1.23-27.63; p=0.026;
supplementary Table 3). Finally, a statistically significant
association was found in the subset of triple-positive
tumors with high expression (≥ 50%) of both hormonal
receptors (p=0.035) (Table 4). Individual responses in
luminal B tumors are illustrated in figure 1.

investigating the predictive role of the Hippo transducer

between TAZ and pCR was reported in the entire cohort.
However, an association emerged when stratifying by

molecular subtype. While TAZ did not have any impact on
pCR in HER2-enriched tumors, a significant association
was observed in Luminal B tumors and in the subset with
high expression of both hormonal receptors. As we did not
note any association between standard clinical-molecular
features and pCR, we provided hints supporting the
hypothesis that TAZ is an independent predictive factor
for pCR. Indeed, the inclusion of the proliferation marker
Ki-67 in the models did not affect our study results (data
available upon request).
In interpreting our results, we are aware that
this study is limited by its retrospective nature and
the relatively restricted number of patients evaluated.
Nevertheless, our study has some important strengths.
First, the experimental path underlying this study
deserves to be mentioned. Patient-derived xenografts
generated with CSCs allow to reconstitute human tumors
in the murine background and to amplify them through
serial transplantation [10, 11]. As mentioned above, our
interest on TAZ stemmed from molecularly characterized
patient-derived xenografts obtained with the delivery of
mammospheres, which are enriched for CSCs, generated
from patients with Luminal B tumors [8]. Thus, our
preclinical model may represent a promising tool for
streamlining the preclinical-clinical transition of novel
biomarkers.
Second, over the past decade many prognostic and
predictive multigene classifiers have been developed to
assist in clinical decision-making [12]. Notwithstanding,
even the broadest investigated genomic assays originally
developed to foresee long-term outcomes are struggling
to gain widespread consensus due to the unclear gain in
precision and cost-effectiveness over standard prognostic
factors [13]. We developed a clinically applicable assay
with the potential to expand the current pipeline of
biomarkers used in routine clinical practice. From a
biological standpoint, it is worth mentioning that the TAZ
score employed in this study was generated by considering
cellular localization, and consequently TAZ activation.
Indeed, cytoplasmic accumulation reflects ubiquitinmediated proteolysis, whereas nuclear translocation is
usually interpreted as an activation of the TAZ-mediated
oncogenic transcriptional program [14].
As pCR in an established surrogate marker for
better long-term outcomes [15], it is of utmost importance
to identify biomarkers of response and resistance to
HER2-directed therapy. Even though a variety of putative
predictive biomarkers have been proposed, spanning from
gene expression profiles to mutations in HER2 and genes
belonging to its transduction machinery [16-19], we are
still waiting for validation studies. Even considering the
sample size of our study, the magnitude of the difference
in the pCR rate seen in Luminal B tumors according to
TAZ status is rather uncommonly reported, and in our
opinion represents a background for a prospective study
with biomarker validation purposes. Moreover, the lesson
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we learned from clinical trials, such as NeoALTTO
[20], GEPARQUINTO [21], and NeoSphere [22], is that
hormone receptor-positive tumors achieve a lower rate of
pCR compared with hormone receptor-negative tumors.
Thus, foreseeing pCR after anti-HER2-based neoadjuvant
therapy acquires an even more relevant therapeutic
implication in this setting. With the present analysis we
have provided clues on the potential predictive value of
a TAZ-based biomarker in HER2-positive and hormone
receptor-positive tumors.
In summary, the message conveyed by this study
is that the TAZ score we developed appears extremely
promising in predicting the individual likelihood to
achieve a pCR to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant
therapy in Luminal B, HER2-positive BC patients. As a
consequence, we plan to prospectively validate the TAZ
score as a molecular predictor in this BC subtype. Finally,
our goal is to examine core components of the Hippo
pathway in different therapeutic settings and molecular
subtypes with the aim of identifying Hippo pathwayrelated prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

METHODS
Study Participants and procedures
Included patients were 61 HER2-positive BC
patients who received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based
therapy. Patients were considered suitable for inclusion
if they had received trastuzumab as a part of their
neoadjuvant treatment, had complete data on baseline
clinical features, therapy administered and treatment
outcomes, if the planned treatment was completed, and
the amount of biological materials was sufficient for
TAZ analysis in their biopsies. Patients were treated
with two different schedules: epirubicin 120 mg/m2 plus
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 administered intravenously
(IV) on day 1 every 21 days for four cycles followed by
docetaxel 100 mg/m2 plus trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (after a
loading dose of 8 mg/kg) administered IV on day 1 every
3 weeks for four cycles, or a reverse sequence with the
administration of trastuzumab for the whole length of
chemotherapy. pCR was defined as no residual invasive
tumor in both breast and axilla (ypT0/is ypN0), and was
assessed by local pathologists. The immunohistochemical
assessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PgR) and HER2 was performed in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissues using the monoclonal
antibodies (MoAbs) 6F11, 1A6 (Menarini, Florence, Italy)
and the polyclonal antibody A0485 (PoAb, Dako, Milan,
Italy). TAZ was evaluated with the MoAb anti-TAZ (M2616, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA,USA). ER and PgR
were considered positive when ≥1% of the neoplastic
cells showed a distinct nuclear immunoreactivity.

HER2 positivity was defined, according to ASCO-CAP
guidelines, as 3+ overexpression by immunohistochemical
testing or as 2+ with HER2 amplification by silver in situ
hybridization (SISH, Inform HER2 DNA Probe; Inform
Chr17 probe, Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) [23]. TAZ
was evaluated in diagnostic core biopsies and considered
positive when >10% of tumor cells displayed nuclear and/
or cytoplasmic immunostaining. TAZ staining intensity
was graded on a four-grade scale (0: negative, 1+: weak,
2+: moderate, 3+: strong). The TAZ score was obtained
by multiplying the staining intensity x 1.5 (nuclear
localization) or 0.5 (cytoplasmic localization), in order to
take into account its activation status. Using the median
score of all tumors as a cut-off point, tumors with a score
≤0.5 were considered as TAZ low, whereas tumors with a
score >0.5 as TAZ high. TAZ expression and localization
were independently evaluated by two investigators (MM
and ADB) who were masked to treatment outcome.
Discordant cases were reviewed at a face-to-face meeting.

We computed descriptive statistics for all variables
of interest. Continuous data were reported as mean and
standard deviation and we represented categorical data
with frequencies and percentage values. In order to assess
the relationships between categorical variables, different
tests were employed: the Pearson’s Chi-squared test of
independence (2-tailed) and the Fisher Exact test. We used
a univariate logistic regression model to identify variables
that could influence the study outcome (pCR). We planned
to insert variables significant in the univariate analysis in a
multivariate logistic regression. We considered statistically
significant p values less than 0.05. Statistical analyses
were carried out using SPSS software (SPSS version 21,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
