Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that a certain type of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hierarchically organized
by a subset of cells with stem cell features (cancer stem cells; CSC). Although normal stem cells and CSCs are
considered to share similar self-renewal programs, it remains unclear whether differentiation programs are
also maintained in CSCs and effectively used for tumor eradication. In this study, we investigated the effect
of oncostatin M (OSM), an interleukin 6–related cytokine known to induce the differentiation of hepatoblasts
into hepatocytes, on liver CSCs. OSM receptor expression was detected in the majority of epithelial cell adhesion molecule–positive (EpCAM+) HCC with stem/progenitor cell features. OSM treatment resulted in the
induction of hepatocytic differentiation of EpCAM+ HCC cells by inducing signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 activation, as determined by a decrease in stemness-related gene expression, a decrease in
EpCAM, α-fetoprotein and cytokeratin 19 protein expressions, and an increase in albumin protein expression.
OSM-treated EpCAM+ HCC cells showed enhanced cell proliferation with expansion of the EpCAM-negative
non-CSC population. Noticeably, combination of OSM treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), which eradicates EpCAM-negative non-CSCs, dramatically increased the number of apoptotic cells in vitro
and suppressed tumor growth in vivo compared with either saline control, OSM, or 5-FU treatment alone. Taken
together, our data suggest that OSM could be effectively used for the differentiation and active cell division of
dormant EpCAM+ liver CSCs, and the combination of OSM and conventional chemotherapy with 5-FU efficiently
eliminates HCC by targeting both CSCs and non-CSCs. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4687–97. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
It is widely accepted that cancer is a disease that develops
from a normal cell with accumulated genetic/epigenetic
changes. Although considered monoclonal in origin, cancer
is composed of heterogeneous cellular populations. These
heterogeneities are traditionally explained by the clonal evolution of cancer cells through a series of stochastic genetic
events (clonal evolution model; ref. 1). In contrast, cancer
cells are known to have the capabilities characteristic of stem
cells with respect to self-renewal, limitless division, and gen-

eration of heterogeneous cell populations. Recent evidence
suggests that tumor cells possess stem cell features (cancer
stem cells; CSC) to self-renew and give rise to relatively differentiated cells through asymmetric division, and thereby
form heterogeneous populations (CSC model; refs. 2, 3).
Accumulating evidence supports the notion that CSCs could
generate tumors more efficiently in immunodeficient mice
than non-CSCs in the case of leukemia and various solid
tumors (4–9), although the origin of CSCs is still a controversial issue.
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most common malignancies with poor outcome (10). Recent
evidence suggests that at least some HCCs are organized by
liver CSCs in a hierarchical manner (11). Several markers
have been identified as useful for the enrichment of liver
CSCs, including side population fraction (12), CD133 (13),
CD90 (14), and OV6 (15). We have recently used epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) to
identify novel prognostic HCC subtypes related to certain
developmental stages of human liver lineages (16). Among
these, EpCAM-positive (+) AFP+ HCC (hepatic stem cell–like
HCC) is characterized by young onset of disease, activation
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and poor prognosis. EPCAM is a
target gene of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (17), and we previously identified that EpCAM+ HCC cells from primary HCC

samples and cell lines have the features of CSCs, at least in
the hepatic stem cell–like HCC subtype (18). Thus, EpCAM
seems to be a potentially useful marker for the isolation of
liver CSCs in hepatic stem cell–like HCC.
CSCs are considered to be resistant to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (19–21), which may be associated with the
recurrence of the tumor after treatment. These findings have
led to the proposal of “destemming” CSCs, to induce the differentiation of CSCs into non-CSCs or to eradicate CSCs by
inhibiting the signaling pathway responsible for self-renewal
(22). Recent studies support this proposal and suggest the
utility of bone morphogenetic proteins, activated during
embryogenesis and required for differentiation of neuronal
stem cells, to induce differentiation of brain CSCs and facilitate brain tumor eradication (23, 24). However, it is still
debatable whether simple differentiation of CSCs effectively
eradicates tumors (25).
Oncostatin M (OSM), an interleukin (IL)-6–related cytokine produced by CD45+ hematopoietic cells, is known to
enhance hepatocytic differentiation of hepatoblasts by inducing the activation of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway (26). Although OSM, IL-6,
and leukemia-inhibitory factor share STAT3 signaling cascades, OSM is known to exploit the distinct hepatocytic differentiation signaling in an OSM receptor (OSMR)–specific
manner (27). In this study, we hypothesized that OSM
induces hepatocytic differentiation of liver CSCs through
the OSMR signaling pathway. We examined OSMR expression and the effect of OSM in EpCAM+ HCC in terms of
hepatocytic differentiation and antitumor activities.

Materials and Methods
Clinical HCC specimens
A total of 107 HCC tissues and adjacent noncancerous
liver tissues were obtained from patients who underwent
hepatectomy for HCC treatment from 1999 to 2007 in Kanazawa University Hospital. These samples were formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded, and used for immunohistochemistry. HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues were histologically diagnosed by two pathologists. An additional fresh
EpCAM+ AFP+ HCC sample was obtained from a surgically
resected specimen and immediately used for the preparation
of single-cell suspensions and xenotransplantation. All tissue
acquisition procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board of Kanazawa University
Hospital. All patients provided written informed consent.
Cell culture and reagents
HuH1 and HuH7 cells were cultured as previously
described (18). A primary HCC tissue was dissected and digested in 1 μg/mL of type 4 collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich Japan
K.K.) solution at 37°C for 15 to 30 minutes. Contaminated
RBC were lysed with ammonium chloride solution (STEMCELL Technologies) on ice for 5 minutes. CD45+ leukocytes
and Annexin V+ apoptotic cells were removed by autoMACSpro cell separator and magnet beads (Miltenyi Biotec K.K.).
EpCAM-positive and -negative cells were enriched by auto-

MACS-pro cell separator and CD326 (EpCAM) MicroBeads
(Miltenyi Biotec K.K.). Recombinant OSM was purchased
from R&D Systems, Inc. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was obtained
from Kyowa Kirin.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The expression
of selected genes was determined in triplicate using the 7900
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Each
sample was normalized relative to β-actin expression. Probes
used were TACSTD1, Hs00158980_m1; AFP, Hs00173490_m1;
KRT19, Hs00761767_s1; hTERT, Hs00162669_m1; Bmi1,
Hs00180411_m1; POU5F1, Hs00999632_g1; CYP3A4,
Hs00430021_m1; OSMR, Hs00384278_m1; and ACTB,
Hs99999903_m1 (Applied Biosystems).
Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer as described previously (28).
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to STAT3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), rabbit polyclonal anti-OSMR antibodies
H-200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti–
phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody (3E2; Cell Signaling
Technology), and mouse monoclonal anti–β-actin antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences,
Corp.) as described by the manufacturer.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
analyses
Immunohistochemistry was performed using Envision+
kits (DAKO) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibody, VU-1D9 (Oncogene
Research Products), was used for detecting EpCAM. Goat
anti-OSMR polyclonal antibodies (C-20) were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse anti-CYP3A4 polyclonal
antibodies (Abnova), mouse anti–cytokeratin (CK) 19 monoclonal antibody (DAKO), and mouse anti–Ki-67 monoclonal
antibody MIB-1 (DAKO) were used for detecting CYP3A4,
CK19, and Ki-67, respectively. Samples with >5% positive
staining in a given area for a particular antibody were
considered to be positive. For immunofluorescence analyses,
anti-EpCAM antibody (Oncogene Research Products),
anti-gp130ST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
anti–phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody (3E2; Cell Signaling Technology) were used. Alexa 488 FITC-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG or Alexa 568 Texas red–conjugated antigoat/rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary
antibodies. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis was
performed essentially as previously described (18).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses
Cultured cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended
in HBSS (Lonza) supplemented with 1% HEPES and 2% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Cells were then incubated with FITCconjugated anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibody Clone
Ber-EP4 (DAKO) on ice for 30 minutes, and analyzed using

a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Intracellular AFP, CK19,
and albumin levels were examined using a BD Cytofix/
Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences),
anti-AFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Nichirei Biosciences
Inc.), anti-CK19 mouse monoclonal antibody (DAKO), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-albumin antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology), respectively.

Statistical analyses
The association of OSMR expression and clinicopathologic
characteristics in HCC was examined using either MannWhitney U or χ2 tests. Student's t test was used to compare
various test groups assayed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Cell proliferation and colony formation assay
For cell proliferation assays, 2 × 103 cells were seeded in
96-well plates and cultured with 1% FBS DMEM (control),
1% DMEM with OSM (100 ng/mL), 5-FU (2 μg/mL), or
OSM (100 ng/mL) and 5-FU (2 μg/mL) for 3 to 7 days without
media changes. Cell viability was evaluated in quadruplicate
using a CellTiter 96 AQueous kit (Promega). For colony formation assays, 1 × 103 cells were harvested in a one-well Culture Slide (BD Biosciences) and cultured with 1% FBS DMEM
(control) with or without OSM (100 ng/mL). Culture medium
was replaced every 3 days and the colonies were fixed with
ice-cold 100% methanol and used for immunofluorescence
10 days after the initiation of treatment.

Results

RNA interference
SiRNAs specific to OSMR (Silencer Select siRNA S17542)
and a control siRNA (Silencer Select Negative Control no. 1)
were obtained from Ambion (Applied Biosystems). To each
well of a six-well plate, 2 × 105 cells were seeded 12 hours
before transfection. Transfection was performed using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 100 pmol/L of siRNA
duplex was used for each transfection.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were cultured in 1% FBS DMEM (control), 1% FBS
DMEM with OSM (100 ng/mL), 5-FU (2 μg/mL), or OSM
(100 ng/mL) and 5-FU (2 μg/mL) for 3 days in six-well plates
or in culture slides (BD Biosciences). Annexin V binding to
cell membranes was visualized using Annexin V-FITC antibodies and a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Activation of caspase 3 was visualized by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence using anti-active caspase3 polyclonal antibodies (Promega), as described by the
manufacturer.
Animal studies
Six-week-old NOD/SCID mice (NOD/NCrCRl-Prkdcscid)
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. The
protocol was approved by the Kanazawa University Animal
Care and Use Committee. One million tumor cells were suspended in 200 μL of DMEM and Matrigel (1:1), and a s.c.
injection was performed. The incidence and size of subcutaneous tumors were recorded. Intratumoral injections of
50 μL of PBS (control), OSM (2 μg/tumor), 5-FU (250 μg/
tumor), or OSM (2 μg/tumor) and 5-FU (250 μg/tumor) were
initiated twice weekly 48 days after the injection of tumor
cells when the average volume of four tumors in each group
had reached 400 mm3. For histologic evaluation, tumors were
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded.

Distinct expression of OSMRs in HCC
Before exploring the effect of OSM on HCC, we examined
the expression of its receptor, OSMR, in surgically resected
HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues by immunohistochemistry. Representative staining of OSMRs in tumor/
nontumor tissues is shown in Fig. 1A. In general, cell surface
and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to OSMR were rarely
detected in hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis liver (a), but
were frequently detected in small hepatocyte-like cells in
the stroma or transitional cells in the lobule of cirrhotic liver
(b), as indicated by the arrows. Note that immunoreactivity
to OSMR was not detected in bile duct epithelia or ductular
reactions in which EpCAM + hepatic progenitor cells are
thought to accumulate (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting
that OSMRs might be expressed in hepatic progenitor cells
committed to hepatocytes. Immunoreactivity to OSMRs
was more strongly detected in HCC than in noncancerous
liver (c), and the expression was heterogeneous in the tumor.
Of note, OSMRs were detected in HCC cells at the invasive
front area of the tumor (d) where CSCs are known to invade
frequently (arrows).
Immunoreactivity to OSMR antibodies and EpCAM
antibodies was detected in 66 (61.7%) and 38 (35.5%) of 107
HCC specimens, respectively. The clinicopathologic characteristics of OSMR+ and OSMR− HCC cases are shown in Table 1.
OSMR+ HCC was characterized by high serum AFP values
(P = 0.009), poorly differentiated morphology (P < 0.0001),
and a high frequency of EpCAM+ HCCs (P = 0.024), suggesting
that the OSMR is expressed in HCC with stem/progenitor cell
features. OSMR+ HCC was also characterized by young onset
of disease and male dominance, although these features did
not reach statistical significance (P = 0.052 and 0.058, respectively). OSMR was more frequently detected in EpCAM+ HCCs
(76.3%) than in EpCAM− HCCs (53.7%). Expression of OSMR
and EpCAM was further investigated by double immunofluorescence analysis, and immunoreactivity to OSMR was
detected in both EpCAM + normal hepatic progenitors
(Fig. 1B) and EpCAM+ HCC cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest
that although OSMR is more widely expressed than EpCAM in
HCC, OSMR is frequently expressed in EpCAM + normal
hepatic progenitors and liver CSCs.
OSM induces hepatocytic differentiation of EpCAM+ HCC
Because OSMR was expressed in the majority of EpCAM+
HCCs, we investigated the effect of OSM on EpCAM+ HCC cell
lines. First, we examined the expression of OSMR and its signal transducer glycoprotein 130 (gp130) in EpCAM+ AFP+
HCC cell lines HuH1 and HuH7 by immunofluorescence

(Fig. 2A). Both gp130 and OSMR protein expressions were
detected in these cells, consistent with the immunohistochemical data. Because OSM is known to induce the hepatocytic differentiation of hepatoblasts in a STAT3-dependent
manner, we investigated the effect of OSM on phosphorylation of STAT3 in HuH1 and HuH7 cells by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Incubation of HCC cells for
1 hour with OSM at a concentration of 100 ng/mL resulted
in the induction and nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated
STAT3 compared with controls (Fig. 2B and C). We examined
the effect of OSM on the EpCAM+ cell population in HuH1 and
HuH7 cells. We first labeled HuH1 and HuH7 cells with CD326
(EpCAM) MicroBeads and FITC-conjugated anti-EpCAM

antibodies (Clone Ber-EP4) and performed positive/negative
selection using magnetic activated cell sorting to determine
the appropriate gating criteria for EpCAM-high (designated
as EpCAM + ) and EpCAM-low/negative (designated as
EpCAM−) cell population (Fig. 2D, top). It is interesting that
OSM treatment (100 ng/mL for 72 hours) diminished the
EpCAM+ cell population from 50.7% to 10.1% in HuH1 and
from 55.2% to 28.8% in HuH7 cells when the same constant
gating criteria was applied (Fig. 2D, bottom).
We used RNA interference to investigate whether the
decrease in EpCAM+ cells by OSM treatment depends on
the expression of OSMR. Transfection of siRNAs specific to
OSMR (si-OSMR) resulted in the knockdown of target genes

compared with the control (si-Control) in HuH1 and HuH7
cells 48 hours after transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
We further confirmed the decrease of OSMR protein
expression by immunofluorescence and Western blotting
72 hours after transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C).
When we treated these HuH1 and HuH7 cells with OSM
(100 ng/mL) for 1 hour, we observed the decrease of phosphorylated STAT3 by OSMR gene silencing compared with
the control (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, OSMmediated decrease in the number of EpCAM + cells was
inhibited by OSMR gene silencing (Supplementary Fig. S2D),
suggesting that OSM exploits the diminution of EpCAM+
cells through the activation of the OSMR signaling pathway
in EpCAM+ HCC.
We further examined the effect of OSM on hepatocytic differentiation by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. OSM
treatment in HuH1 cells reduced the expression of hepatic
progenitor–related genes including AFP, KRT19 (encoding
CK19), and TERT (encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase;
TERT; Fig. 3A). OSM treatment further reduced the expression of BMI1 and POU5F1 (encoding Oct4), which is known
to be expressed and required for self-renewal in embryonic
stem cells. OSM treatment also increased the expression of
the hepatocyte marker, CYP3A4. Furthermore, OSM treatment reduced AFP+ and CK19+ cells and increased albumin+
cells compared with the untreated controls, as evaluated by
the geometric mean of the fluorescence intensities of whole
cells analyzed by intracellular FACS (Fig. 3B). Similar results
were obtained in HuH7 cells (data not shown) and, taken
together, these data suggest that OSM induced the hepatocytic
differentiation of EpCAM+ HCCs.

Hepatocytic differentiation of EpCAM+ HCC by
OSM augments cell proliferation
In general, normal stem cells are more quiescent than differentiated cells in terms of cell division. We therefore evaluated the effect of OSM on cell proliferation in HuH1 and
HuH7 cells. It is interesting that OSM treatment for 10 days
resulted in a larger colony formation following treatment
with OSM (100 ng/mL) compared with untreated controls.
Of note, the majority of cells comprising these larger colonies were EpCAM−, or had low expression levels, whereas a
subset of untreated control cells maintained high EpCAM
expression (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when cell
proliferation was examined using a [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium]
tetrazolium assay and Ki-67 labeling index (Fig. 3D). OSM
modestly enhanced cell proliferation (top) and increased Ki67–positive cells (middle and bottom) compared with untreated controls in both HuH1 and HuH7 cells with statistical
significance (Fig. 3D).
OSM treatment increases chemosensitivity of
EpCAM+ HCC
The abovementioned data imply that although OSM may
induce the hepatocytic differentiation of dormant EpCAM+ liver
CSCs, OSM treatment alone might instead enhance cell proliferation through expansion of amplifying differentiated cancer
cells in vitro, raising the question of efficacy of differentiation
therapy in EpCAM+ HCC. Because rapidly amplifying cells are
considered to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents,
we investigated the effect of combining OSM treatment with
conventional chemotherapy to target both dormant CSCs and
amplifying non-CSCs. We have shown that 5-FU treatment

alone could diminish EpCAM− non-CSCs which results in the
enrichment of EpCAM + CSCs in HCC (18). We therefore
explored the effect of 5-FU in combination with OSM on
EpCAM+ HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro.

When HuH1 and HuH7 cells were treated with OSM alone
and cultured for 7 days, cell proliferation was modestly
increased compared with untreated controls (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, 5-FU treatment clearly inhibited cell proliferation.

membranes and the activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 4B and C).
Although OSM treatment alone had a small effect on the

and activated caspase 3+ cells more than in the control. The

combination of OSM and 5-FU most strongly induced apoptosis in both HuH1 and HuH7 cells with statistical significance.
Finally, we investigated the effect of OSM on EpCAM+ HCC
in vivo using a primary HCC specimen and cell lines. Singlecell suspensions from primary EpCAM+ HCC cells (1 × 106
cells) were injected into 6-week-old male NOD/SCID mice,
and these cells formed subcutaneous tumors 48 days after
transplantation. Subsequently, 50 μL of PBS, OSM (2 μg/
tumor), 5-FU (250 μg/tumor), or OSM (2 μg/tumor) and
5-FU (250 μg/tumor) solution were injected directly into
each tumor twice a week. Although OSM treatment alone
showed weak tumor-suppressive effects, the changes in
tumor size showed no significant difference compared with
controls (Fig. 5A). Similarly, 5-FU treatment alone showed
limited tumor-suppressive effects. However, the combination
of OSM with 5-FU showed a marked inhibition of tumor
growth compared with PBS control or 5-FU alone (P = 0.02
and 0.05, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis of
xenografted tumors showed that OSM treatment decreased
the number of EpCAM + or CK19 + cells and increased
CYP3A4+ cells in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). FACS
analysis of xenografted tumors further confirmed the
decrease of EpCAM + cell population by OSM treatment
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that the combination of OSM with 5-FU
strongly induced the activation of caspase 3 compared with
PBS control, OSM, or 5-FU (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these
data suggest that hepatocytic differentiation of EpCAM+
HCC cells induced by OSM was the most effective for inhibition of tumor growth in vivo when the conventional chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU was coadministered.

hepatocytic differentiation and active cell proliferation in
EpCAM+ HCC through OSMR signaling.
OSMR is expressed in hepatoblasts in the fetal liver (26). We
have found that OSMR is frequently expressed in normal
hepatic progenitors but is rarely detected in hepatocytes in
adult livers. Interestingly, OSMR+ HCC was characterized by

Discussion
A growing body of evidence suggests that there are similarities between normal stem cells and CSCs in terms of selfrenewal programs (29). We have recently reported that Wnt/
β-catenin signaling augments self-renewal and inhibits the
differentiation of EpCAM+ liver CSCs (18). In the present
study, we have shown that the OSM-OSMR signaling pathway is maintained in HCCs with stem/progenitor cell
features. OSM induces hepatocytic differentiation and activates cell division in dormant EpCAM+ liver CSCs (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, we have shown that the combination of OSM
and 5-FU effectively inhibits tumor cell growth, revealing the
importance of targeting both CSCs and non-CSCs for eradication of the tumor.
OSM is a pleiotropic cytokine that belongs to the IL-6
family which includes IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia-inhibitory
factor. These cytokines share the gp130 receptor subunit as
a common signal transducer, and activate Janus tyrosine
kinases and the STAT3 pathway. However, gp130 forms a
heterodimer with a unique partner such as the IL-6 receptor,
leukemia-inhibitory factor receptor, or OSMR, thus transducing a certain signaling uniquely induced by each cytokine
(30). Of note, OSM is known to activate hepatocytic differentiation programs in hepatoblasts in an OSMR-specific manner (27), and our data showed that OSM could induce

high serum AFP, frequent EpCAM positivity, and poorly differentiated morphology, suggesting that OSMR is more likely
expressed in HCC with stem/progenitor cell features (16).
Although the regulatory mechanisms of OSMR are still
unclear, it is plausible that OSMR expression is regulated by
a signaling pathway activated during the process of hepatogenesis. Because gp130 is known to be ubiquitously expressed,
regulation of OSM signaling might be largely dependent on the
expression status of OSMR in normal and tumor tissues.
Recent studies have shown the potential role of methylation
of CpG islands located in OSMR promoter in colorectal cancer
(31, 32). Clarification of OSMR promoter activity regulation,
including CpG methylation, might provide clues for better understanding of hepatocytic differentiation signaling in both
normal hepatic stem cells and CSCs.
It has been postulated that both normal stem cells and
CSCs are dormant and show slow cell cycles. Consistent with
this, CSCs are considered to be more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents than non-CSCs, possibly due to slow cell
cycles as well as an increased expression of ATP-binding
cassette transporters, robust DNA damage responses, and activated antiapoptotic signaling (20, 33, 34). Therefore, development of an effective strategy by targeting CSC pools
together with conventional chemotherapies is essential to
eradicate a tumor mass. Two strategies have been investigated to reduce the CSCs population in the tumor; that is,
inhibition of self-renewal programs and activation of differentiation programs. We have shown that hepatocytic differentiation of liver CSCs by OSM results in enhanced cell
proliferation in vitro. We have further shown here that
OSM-mediated hepatocytic differentiation of liver CSCs in
combination with conventional chemotherapy effectively
suppresses HCC growth. It is possible that OSM may boost
antitumor activity of 5-FU by “exhausting dormant CSCs”
through hepatocytic differentiation and active cell division.
It is encouraging that similar success with differentiation
therapy has recently been reported in several cancers
(24, 35, 36). In addition, HNF4-α–mediated differentiation
of HCC cells has recently been reported to be effective for
the eradication of HCC (37). However, although the combination of OSM and 5-FU effectively inhibited tumor growth in

our model, we could not observe the shrinkage of the tumor.
Thus, induction of CSC's differentiation with eradication of
non-CSCs might not be enough for the eradication of the
tumor, which might suggest the importance of inhibiting
self-renewal as well as stimulating differentiation of CSCs.
Because we induced the hepatocytic differentiation of the subcutaneous tumor by local injection of OSM, further rigorous
studies are clearly required to assess the effect of OSM on liver
CSCs and its utility for differentiation therapy in HCC.
CSCs may acquire resistance against differentiation therapy by additional genetic/epigenetic changes during treatment by clonal evolution, as observed in conventional
chemotherapy. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that
bone morphogenetic protein–mediated brain CSC differentiation failed in a subset of brain tumors in which bone morphogenetic protein receptor promoters were methylated and
silenced (23). Similarly, OSMR silencing by promoter methylation might result in the development of OSM-resistant
clones in HCC.
In conclusion, OSMR is expressed in certain types of HCC
with stem/progenitor cell features, and OSM induces hepatocytic differentiation and active cell division of OSMR+ liver
CSCs to enhance chemosensitivity to 5-FU. The clinical safety
and utility of OSM should be evaluated in the near future.
