ABSTRACT:
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a potential target
for drug development, particularly due to the fact that it plays such a crucial role in
cancer biology. In addition, next-generation mTOR inhibitors have become available,
marking an exciting new phase in mTOR-based therapy. However, the verdict on their
therapeutic effectiveness remains unclear. Here we review phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling as one of the primary mechanisms for sustaining
tumor outgrowth and metastasis, recent advances in the development of mTOR
inhibitors, and current studies addressing mTOR activation/inhibition in colorectal
cancer (CRC). We will also discuss our recent comparative study of different mTOR
inhibitors in a population of colon cancer stem cells (CSCs), and current major
challenges for achieving individualized drug therapy using kinase inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

of mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR
(Rictor), mLST8/GβL, stress-activated-protein-kinaseinteracting protein 1 (Sin1), proline-rich repeat protein-5
(PRR-5)/protein observed with Rictor-1 (Protor-1), and
Deptor. The upstream regulation of mTORC2 is not well
defined, although ribosome association appears to be a
major, if not the sole, mechanism of mTORC2 activation
[3]. mTORC2 plays an important role in cell survival,
metabolism, proliferation and cytoskeleton organization,
as it phosphorylates Protein Kinase Cα (PKCα), Serum/
glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), as well as
Akt, allowing for complete activation of Akt [4-7]. Akt
is therefore both an upstream activator of mTORC1 and
downstream effector of mTORC2 (Figure 1).
Because it plays such a crucial role in cancer
biology, mTOR has emerged as a potential target for drug
development. Several mTOR inhibitors have already gone
through clinical trials for treating various cancers without
great success. Nevertheless, the role of mTOR inhibitors
in cancer therapy continues to evolve, as new compounds
are synthetized. 
In the present review we have focused on the role for
mTOR in orchestrating key physiological and pathological
processes, with a particular emphasis on colorectal cancer
(CRC), which remains the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States [8].

Classically, Akt has been viewed as the main
upstream activator of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). Indeed, activated Akt phosphorylates and
inhibits tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), allowing Ras
homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) to accumulate in the
GTP-bound state and trigger activation of the mTOR
complex1 (mTORC1) pathway. mTORC1 is composed by
mTOR, regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor),
mLST8/G-protein β-subunit like protein (GβL), RAS40
and Deptor. The activation of mTOR in mTORC1 leads to
phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1)
and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), mediators of
protein translation and cell growth [1]. mTOR response
to a wide range of intracellular (energy and stress) and
extracellular (nutrients, growth factors, hormones) signals
is mediated through these effectors. In response to nutrient
and growth factor availability, mTORC1 suppresses
autophagy, a process by which metabolically stressed cells
recycle cytoplasmic components including organelles, to
recover energy necessary for their survival. mTORC1 has
also been recently identified as orchestrating anabolic cell
growth by stimulating nucleotide synthesis through the
pyrimidine synthesis pathway [2].
Different from mTORC1, mTORC2 is composed

mTOR as a proto-oncogene

the impact of mutations on the function of mTOR
and in vitro oncogenicity in some cases. However,
the tumorigenic potential of the mTOR gene has only
recently been established. By introducing mutations into
evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues in major
functional domains of human mTOR, Murugan et al.
demonstrated that the mTOR gene is a proto-oncogene
that possesses strong tumorigenicity when genetically
activated [25]. Specifically, eight mutants in the HEAT
repeats (M938T) and the FAT (W1456R and G1479N)
and kinase (P2273S, V2284M, V2291I, T2294I, and
E2288K) domains of mTOR were generated. These
mutants showed increased protein kinase activities and
activated the mTOR/p70S6K and Akt signaling pathways
in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). The kinase
domain mutants which exhibited the greatest gains in
activity, P2273S and E2288K were subsequently selected
to explore the oncogenic potential of the mTOR gene
in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3.
mTOR mutant-expressing cells showed morphologic
transformation and anchorage-independent growth,
possessed invasive ability and in vivo tumorigenicity. This
discovery of oncogenic mTOR mutations may facilitate
the design of drugs targeting mTOR, as well as help
predict their efficacy. For example, in yeast, resistance to
Rapalogs has been associated with mutations in FK506
binding protein 12 (FKBP12) or the FKBP-rapamycinbinding (FRB) domain of TOR [26].

Although mTOR is frequently activated in human
cancers, mutation of the mTOR gene has been found only
occasionally [9-11]. This means that over-activation of
the mTOR pathway is mostly due to signaling defects
upstream of mTOR in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway. Mutations in PI3K alpha
catalytic subunit kinase domain (PIK3CA) generally arise
late in tumorigenesis, and can be identified in 32% of CRC
tumors [12]. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and mutations
in Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative
regulator of PI3K activity, have also been reported in
CRC [13]. Both PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss lead
to mTOR over-activation. Although mutations in Akt
genes are rarely found in CRC [14], a somatic missense
mutation of Akt1 (E17K) in the pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain resulting in constitutive association of Akt1 with
the plasma membrane and Akt1 prolonged activation
has been reported in CRC, which can lead to mTOR
deregulation [15]. Similarly, although rare, germline TSC
gene mutations, which have been associated with colonic
hamartomatous polyps, account for 1% CRC, possibly
through mTOR pathway triggering [16, 17] (Figure 1).
Several studies have attempted to characterize
activating mutations in the mTOR gene [18-24]. These
studies, mostly conducted using yeast, have demonstrated

Figure 1: Simplified scheme of mTOR pathway activation. Akt activation releases Rheb from the inhibitory effects of TSC1/2

thus allowing mTOR activation. Signaling defects upstream of mTOR in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (mutations in PTEN, PI3K, Akt
and TSCs) lead to mTOR deregulation. Akt can also be a downstream effector of mTOR, due to mTOR association with different protein
partners to form two functionally distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.

mTOR’s role in proliferation, differentiation and
senescence

capacity [30]. Similarly, mTOR inhibition by Rapamycin
enriches CD133+ subpopulations in liver tumor cells
[31]. This enrichment is most likely achieved through
blocking differentiation of the CD133+ subpopulations,
enhancing apoptosis in the CD133- subsets, and triggering
the conversion of CD133- to CD133+ cells. Thus, the
maintenance of CD133+ cells in vivo by Rapamycin leads
to high continuous tumorigenic potential in the context
of liver cancer. These data suggest that mTOR signaling
is involved in regulating the balance of proliferation
and differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and that
transient inhibition of mTOR can promote tumor reemergence in certain tumor types via enrichment of CSCs.
The molecular mechanism(s) underlying these
paradoxical effects of mTOR are not fully understood.
It has been suggested that strong oncogenic signals
(RAS, PI3K) concomitantly induce cell cycle arrest

While emerging evidence supports a central role of
the mTOR pathway in cell growth and cancer progression,
increased mTOR activity can also play a role mediating
the depletion of the epithelial stem cell compartment.
Indeed, the aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway
can paradoxically cause cells to undergo differentiation
or senescence, thereby exiting the proliferative cell
pool [27]. This concept is well demonstrated by the fact
that persistent activation of mTOR by wingless-related
MMTV integration site 1 (Wnt1) leads to accelerated
epithelial stem cell senescence and premature aging in
mice [28, 29]. Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR prevents
the loss of proliferative epithelial progenitor stem cells
upon radiation and enhances their tissue repopulating

and activation of growth-promoting (i.e., anabolic)
pathways such mTOR. Cell cycle arrest by itself is not
yet senescence [32]. Nevertheless, in the presence of
growth-stimulation, cell cycle blockage eventually
leads to senescence. This mechanism by which arrested
cells are converted to senescent cells has been named
gerogenic conversion or geroconversion [33]. To avoid
geroconversion, cancer cells must lose expression of cell
cycle inhibitors, such as p53. Thus, cross-talk between
p53 and the mTOR signaling pathways can determine
whether stressed cells undergo apoptosis, reversible
quiescence or irreversible senescence [34]. Inhibitors of
mTOR can suppress geroconversion, protecting adult stem
cells from undergoing premature cell senescence while
simultaneously preventing their oncogenic transformation
[35]. Amongst mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin has been
defined as a “longevity enhancer and cancer preventative

agent” in the context of p53 deficiency [36]. Indeed,
continuous treatment with Rapamycin or a novel
Rapamycin formulation (Rapatar) delayed carcinogenesis
in tumor-prone p53+/-and p53-/-mice respectively, most
likely by slowing down the process of aging [37, 38].
Similarly, chronic treatment of mice with an enterically
released formulation of Rapamycin (eRapa) delayed
the onset and/or progression of neuroendocrine tumors
in Rb1+/- mice [39]. Likewise, hypoxia can decelerate
geroconversion and extend lifespan. Indeed, not only does
hypoxia arrests cell cycle, but also inhibits the mTOR
pathway, thus preventing irreversible cellular senescence
[40]. It turns out that in stem cell niches, stem cells
might be protected from senescence and maintained in a
quiescent status instead, thanks to the low oxygen levels
which characterize stem cell niches [41]. Overall, these
studies point out molecular differences in normal and

Figure 2: Simplified scheme of activators and effectors of both mTOR complexes, together with effects of mTOR
inhibition using different mTOR inhibitors. mTOR can be shared by two different complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.

Phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 and Ser2481 are indicative of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, respectively. mTORC1 can
be activated by nutrients (amino acids, glucose), growth factors (Insulin, Insulin-like Growth Factor-1), hormones (leptin), and stresses
(starvation, hypoxia, and DNA damage). Through mTORC1, these signals accelerate the synthesis of key proteins, involved in growth,
division, metabolism and angiogenesis. mTORC1-activated p70 S6K1 and Grb10 mediate IRS-1 degradation, thus inhibiting PI3K/Akt
activation. Grb10 also leads to negative feedback inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway. Finally, activated p70 S6K1 inhibits mTORC2
signaling by phosphorylating Rictor on Thr1135. Allosteric mTOR inhibitors exert an incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 and are inactive
against mTORC2 under short-term conditions. Moreover, they disrupt the mTORC1-dependent negative feedback loop to IRS-1/PI3K,
MAPK/ERK and mTORC2. As a consequence, treatment with mTOR allosteric inhibitors often results in increased mTORC2 activity.
mTORC2 functions upstream of Akt providing the critical second phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, which is necessary for Akt full
activation. mTORC2 also regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by activating PKCα, and regulates growth via SGK1 phosphorylation. The
upstream regulation of mTORC2 is not well defined although ribosome association appears to be a major, if not the sole, mechanism
of mTORC2 activation. Catalytic mTOR inhibitors are able to suppress activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, avoiding
oncogenic signaling pathway activation

(RCC) [44]. While resistance to Rapalogs has been
associated with mutations in FKBP12 or the FKB
domain of TOR in yeast [26], in human, it has been
mostly associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations
[45]. Additional mechanisms of resistance include upregulation of the Proviral integration site for Moloney
murine leukemia virus (PIM) family of oncogenic serine/
threonine kinases [46], oxidative stress [47], and overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins [48]. Nevertheless,
suppression of several negative feedback loops following
mTORC1 targeting is mostly responsible for failure of
mTOR inhibitors. Biopsies taken from patients affected
by malignancies other than RCC, like colon and breast
tumors, showed activated Akt following treatment with
Rapalogs [49, 50]. Pro-survival rather than anticancer
effects of Rapalogs likely results from disruption of the
mTORC1-dependent negative feedback loop to mTORC2
and IRS-1/PI3K. Particularly, mTORC1-activated S6K1
phosphorylates Rictor and/or Insulin receptor substrate
(IRS)-1, thus inhibiting mTORC2 and PI3K/Akt signaling,
respectively [51, 52]. More recent findings indicate that
mTORC1 also phosphorylates Growth Factor Receptor
Bound Protein 10 (Grb10), leading to accumulation of
Grb10 and negative feedback inhibition of PI3K and the
Microtubule-associated protein kinase/Extracellular-signal

Development of mTOR inhibitors: progress and
challenges
Rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic produced by
Streptomyces hygroscopicus, was the first mTOR inhibitor
discovered. More precisely, by exploiting Rapamycin’s
antifungal properties researchers were able to identify
mTOR [42]. Guba et al. described Rapamycin antitumor
effects for the first time in 2002, in their Nature Medicine
paper [43]. Traditionally used as an immunosuppressant
for organ transplants, Rapamycin was found to suppress
tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis. Since then,
additional inhibitors of mTOR function were synthesized
with similar characteristics to Rapamycin, constituting
the family of Rapalogs. Rapalogs, which also include
Everolimus, Temsirolimus, and Ridaforolimus, bind
FKBP12 and interfere with the FRB domain of mTOR.
These compounds have gone through clinical trials as
single agents for treating various cancers without great
success. However, Temsirolimus and Everolimus were
both effective against advanced renal cell carcinoma

regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway [53]. Thus, overactivation of upstream pathways following suppression
of the above-mentioned feedback loops potentially
counterbalances the antiproliferative effects of mTOR
inhibitors. To overcome the detrimental consequences of
feedback loop activation, a second generation of inhibitors,
which compete with ATP in the catalytic site of mTOR,
and inhibit both complexes, was developed [54]. Figure 2
depicts activators and effectors of both mTOR complexes,
together with the effects of mTOR inhibition using
different mTOR inhibitors. Table 1 and Table 2 provide
a list of different ATP-competitive mTOR-selective or
PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors that have been validated in
preclinical cancer studies. These studies showed inhibition
of tumor growth in a number of xenograft models [55147]. As shown in Table 1, ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitors have often been used in combination with
ionizing radiation (IR) as well as many chemicals. Clinical
trials have been completed for AZD8055, INK-128, OSI027, NVP-BEZ23, and XL765. Additional clinical trials
utilizing mTOR-inhibiting agents are ongoing.
mTOR kinase inhibitors (mTorKIs) do not cause Akt
feedback activation observed with Rapalogs. However,
Rodrik-Outmezguine et al. showed a biphasic effect of
these drugs on Akt [148]. Inhibition of mTORC2 led to
Akt Ser473 de-phosphorylation and a rapid but transient
inhibition of Akt Thr308 phosphorylation and Akt
signaling. Nevertheless, inhibition of mTOR kinase also
relieves feedback inhibition of Receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) leading to subsequent PI3K activation and rephosphorylation of Akt Thr308 sufficient to reactivate Akt
activity and signaling. Importantly, similar mechanisms
might also exist in tumor-associated stromal cells such
as endothelial cells. Phosphorylation of Akt Thr308,
Akt substrates [PRAS40, FoxO1 (forkhead box protein
O1), and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase–3)], and
SGK substrate [NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated
1)] rebounds as early as 4 hours after adding mTorKIs
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),
implying that PI3K is activated in response to mTOR
inhibition in these cells [149]. Particularly, mTorKIs
induce the expression of multiple RTK-encoding genes
and signaling by promoting the de-phosphorylation of
FoxO1, which eventually result in increased activation of
PI3K. Thus mTorKIs may render endothelial cells more
prone to PI3K inhibition, suggesting that combinations of
PI3K and mTOR inhibitors might have synergistic effects
and fully inhibit endothelial cell growth [149].
An additional limitation to the use of catalytic
mTOR inhibitors is that they inhibit mTOR within the
mTOR complexes and do not block intrinsic activity of
mTOR-binding partners, which, although deprived of
mTOR kinase activity, could continue conveying growth
and survival signals in response to death stimuli. As
opposed to Rapalogs and mTorKIs, P529 is a first-inclass allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1/mTORC2 that can
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dissociate both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, thus
overcoming possible activity of mTOR-binding partners.
However, it is not clear whether P529 directly interacts
with the mTOR complexes causing their dissociation.
It may inhibit a chaperone, which assembles the mTOR
complexes. Nevertheless, P529 was reported to inhibit
tumor growth, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability
[150], and to be effective in the treatment of prostate
cancer [151, 152]. Moreover, P529 was explored as a
therapeutic option for the treatment of keloid disease
[153]. Aside from its association with cancer, deregulation
of the mTOR pathway is in fact linked to several other
diseases, including ocular, fibrotic, viral, skin and central
nervous system diseases.

mTOR signaling in colon: past and present
evidence
mTORC1 is a major sensor of the organismal
nutritional state. Indeed, caloric restriction lowers
mTORC1 signaling in Paneth cells, a key constituent of
the mammalian intestinal stem-cell (ISC) niche. Paneth
cells, in turn, stimulate small-intestinal stem cells to
proliferate [154]. Thus, mTOR inhibition can improve
intestinal regeneration in patients affected by intestinal
atrophy. While mTORC1 inhibition can increase the
number and regenerative capacity of ISCs, excessive
mTORC1 stimulation can lead to the onset of cancer.
Indeed, the importance of mTORC1 pathway in intestinal
polyp formation has been well described in several papers
using the Apc∆716 mice, a mouse model of familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Through these studies,
mTORC1 was found to stimulate chromosomal instability
(CIN) through anaphase bridge formation, enhancing,
as a consequence, both tumor initiation and progression
[155]. Similarly, ex vivo immunohistochemical studies
on human colorectal adenomas and cancers confirmed
that mTORC1 signaling occurs as an early event in
the process of tumorigenesis, and participates in the
progression of normal cells to a neoplastic phenotype
[156], sustaining the bases of mTORC1-targeted drug
development for therapy and prevention of colon polyps
and cancers. Accordingly, Everolimus-mediated mTORC1
inhibition suppressed polyp formation and reduced
mortality in Apc∆716 mice [157]. However, blocking
of a specific pathway may disrupt the balance between
signaling pathways and enhance oncogenic signals. In
that regard, in parallel with its cytostatic effect, mTORC1
inhibition by Rapamycin strongly increased MAPK kinase
(MEK)/ERK activity, resulting in the appearance of a
spindle morphology and higher invasiveness of KRAStransformed intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) [158]. In
this system, Rapamycin treatment also increased Bcl2 levels, further indicating the need to develop new
therapeutic drugs capable of overcoming the relief of

feedback inhibition of pro-survival, pro-invasive and
pro-metastatic pathways. Besides mTORC1, mTORC2
has been shown to be overexpressed in CRC and to play
an important role in cancer biology. Down-regulation
of mTORC2 reduced proliferation of colon cancer cell
lines and inhibited the formation of tumor xenografts in
vivo [159, 160]. Moreover both mTORC1 and mTORC2
complexes were shown to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), motility, and metastasis of CRCs via
RhoA and Rac1 GTPases, providing the rationale for
including ATP-competitive mTOR-selective or PI3K/
mTOR dual inhibitors for therapy of CRC patients [161].
Dual inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1/2 signaling by
NVP-BEZ235 was shown to induce tumor regression
in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model for
sporadic CRC [112]. Consistent with this finding, a more
recent study also demonstrated the efficacy of NVPBEZ235 and of an additional catalytic mTOR inhibitor,
pp242, in human colon cancer cell line xenografts [61].
Nevertheless, a remarkable intrinsic drug resistance of
a large proportion of CRC cell lines to new-generation
mTOR inhibitors, including both NVP-BEZ235 and pp242
compounds, was also described, warranting further studies
[162]. By screening a panel of over 600 human cancer
cell lines to identify markers of resistance and sensitivity
to pp242, Ducker et al. found that KRAS mutations are
responsible for conferring resistance to pp242 [132]. This
resistance was specifically linked to changes in the level
of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, and was not evident in
either a tumor with wild type KRAS or a tumor with a
PIK3CA mutation in addition to KRAS. This and other
studies [163] highlight the importance of monitoring the
phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 to assess responses
to mTorKIs. Additional experimental evidence has
revealed that pp242 treatment of a panel of CRC cell lines
transiently inhibits Akt Ser473 phosphorylation while
increasing the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) at Tyr1068 [129]. A parallel increase of
Akt Ser473 and EGFR Tyr1068 in cells following pp242
treatment raises the possibility that, apart from KRAS
mutations, EGFR phosphorylation, might also contribute
to the incomplete inhibition of mTORC2 by pp242.
Accordingly, the combination treatment of pp242 and
erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, completely blocked both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity, inhibited cell growth
and suppressed the progression of CRC xenografts [129].
An additional and previously undescribed
mechanism leading to Rapamycin resistance, based on
3-Phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)/Myc signaling, has also been
reported in the context of CRC. Specifically, epigenetic
loss of Protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B,
beta (PPP2R2B), occurring in >90% colorectal tumor
samples, was indicated as a molecular event affecting the
sensitivity of CRC to mTOR inhibitors [164]. On loss
of PPP2R2B, Rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKTindependent manner, resulting in resistance. Re-expression
of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic
inhibition of PDK1 (using the small molecule BX912)
abrogates Rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation,
leading to Rapamycin sensitization. Additional studies
revealed that PDK1 directly induces phosphorylation
of PLK1, which in turn induces Myc phosphorylation
and protein accumulation [165]. Importantly, the PLK1
inhibitor BI2536 worked in synergy with NVP-BEZ235
to induce robust apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition
in CRC [165]. This study emphasizes the importance of
epigenetic mechanisms in regulating oncogenic signaling
and therapeutic response. Moreover, it indicates PPP2R2B
may serve as a predictive marker for patient selection,
whereas Myc phosphorylation can serve as a surrogate
marker to evaluate the drug response.

mTOR inhibitors for the ablation of colon cancer
stem-like cells: future hopes
Over the last decade, proposed theories in cancer
biology have drastically changed. Contrary to the longstanding clonal evolution model described by Nowell in
the late 70’s [166], the CSC hypothesis proposed that not
every cell of the body could be the target of malignant
transformation. The limited lifespan of a committed cell is
likely shorter than the time necessary to accumulate tumorinducing genetic changes. Therefore, cancer-initiating
capability could be a unique feature of long-lived, self
renewing stem cells [167]. Indeed, much experimental
evidence indicates that stem cell transformation might be
an early event in carcinogenesis. Transformation of normal
stem cells through loss of APC is an extremely efficient
route towards initiating intestinal adenomas [168]. The
CSC hypothesis is neither a universal model for all
cancers nor for all patients with the same disease. While
some cancers have been hypothesized to initiate as a stem
cell disease, they may then progress by clonal evolution
of their CSCs, as CRC has been suggested to do through
CIN [169].
To our knowledge, only one study investigated the
effects of mTOR inhibitors in cancer stem-like cells so far.
mTOR signaling was shown to be activated in colorectal
cell line-derived spheres in serum-free medium [170].
Treatment with Rapamycin and pp242 diminished sphereforming capacity as well as aldehyde dehydrogenase
isoform 1 (ALDH1) activity. However, only pp242
suppressed the enrichment of ALDH+ cells induced by
chemotherapy, thus highlighting an essential role of
mTORC2 signaling in the maintenance of the CRC stemlike phenotype. Although this study further confirmed the
importance of mTOR signaling in CRC, the authors did
not perform sufficient functional experiments to assess
the effect of mTOR inhibition on biological properties
56

and tumorigenic potentials of CRC stem-like cells.
Moreover, a controversy exists in the literature regarding
the use of ALDH+ cells isolated from cancer cell lines as
in vitro models for CSC study, further indicating the need
to study the effect of mTOR inhibition using alternative
methods to identify and characterize CSCs. Multiple cellsurface proteins have been proposed as potential candidate
markers for colon CSCs, and our in vitro system, based on
a feeder layer derived from rat mammary adenocarcinoma,
efficiently enriches for these cells [169]. Recently, we
analyzed colon CSCs for expression of major mTORC1/2
pathway components [171]. Colon CSCs exhibited
unexpectedly low Akt signaling. Nevertheless, they
showed mTORC2 activation. We indicated SGK1 as the
possible main mTORC2 effector in colon CSCs. Akt hypophosphorylation and dependence of SGK family members
for viability are known to occur most frequently in the
context of wild-type PTEN, and helical PIK3CA mutations
[172]. Future studies are needed to confirm whether this
genetic signature can predict resistance or sensitivity of
colon CSCs to different mTorKIs. Unfortunately, the
prognostic and predictive value of common mutations
in patients with CRC is controversial, due to a bias in
research settings [173]. In our opinion, mTorKI resistance
might also occur through less well-studied but equally
important epigenetic mechanisms [174].
mTOR inhibitors affected colon CSCs differently,
resulting in proliferation, induction of autophagy or
apoptosis. The apoptosis-inducing mTOR inhibitor
Torin-1 hindered growth, motility, invasion, and survival
of CD326+/CD24+/CD49f+/CD29+ and CD326+/CD44+/
CD166+ CRC subpopulations in vitro, and suppressed
tumor growth in vivo with a concomitant reduction in
vessel formation. Torin-1 also affected the expression
of markers for cell proliferation, angio-/lympho-genesis,
and stemness in vivo. Our study also indicated that
although Torin-1 resistant clones can emerge, they are
poorly tumorigenic, thus encouraging its potential use
for CRC therapy. Because normal stem cells and CSCs
share many traits, it seems reasonable to think that any
therapy targeting CSCs may also destroy healthy tissues
[175]. Through an innovative system based on the use of
the mouse lymph node as an in vivo bioreactor [176], we
showed that Torin-1 does not affect the survival of normal
colon stem cells in vivo, suggesting its selectivity towards
cancer cells. All these data support further development of
Torin-1 for the clinical treatment of CRC.

mTOR implies that there are still downstream pathways
to be identified. A more comprehensive understanding of
the dynamics of mTOR signaling networks is therefore
required for the design of safe and effective drug
molecules targeting the mTOR pathway.
ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors have both
advantages and disadvantages. Undoubtedly, they have a
well-defined target, their biological effects are easy to be
observed, and they transit quickly to clinical trials. On the
other hand, they often have a high level of cross-reactivity
with other kinases, are not pharmacologically tolerated,
and easily lead to the development of drug resistance.
Identifying biological factors that may predict efficacy or
resistance to mTOR inhibitors is still challenging, since
mTOR inhibitors may exert antitumor effects through
multiple mechanisms of action. Moreover, crosstalk
of the mTOR pathway with other pathways gives rise
to compensatory loops for tumor cells to escape antitumor stimuli. This reveals the adaptive capabilities of
oncogenic signaling networks and the limitations of
monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways.
Drug combinations targeting multiple pathways have
been exploited to overcome this resistance but it is not
clear which strategy will yield the greater therapeutic
benefit. Additionally, the use of multiple drugs increases
side effects and adverse reactions. In our study, a single
mTOR inhibitor, Torin-1 was able to counteract CRC
progression, supporting the rationale for its clinical
testing [171]. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by
which Torin-1 acts remains to be elucidated. It must be
noted that not all CRC patients could benefit from this
therapy due to large individual variability in drug efficacy
and safety. The observed discrepancy in outcome using
different mTOR inhibitors in a population of colon CSCs
is not only related to the difference of mTOR inhibitors in
terms of pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties,
but also to intrinsic variations in colon CSCs. A major
goal of clinical pharmacology and pharmacogenomics is
to establish phenotype-genotype associations that reveal
drug response and toxicity. Unfortunately, although the
impact of variations of the human genome sequence
on the response to drug therapy has been increasingly
considered in recent years, for complex diseases like CRC,
it could be very difficult to determine unequivocally an
exact phenotype or genotype that would predict therapy
outcome. Genetic variations can result from singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertion, deletion,
or duplication of DNA sequences. SNP of drug targets,
drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, DNA
repair enzymes, are likely to affect drug response [177].
In addition, non-genetic factors could contribute to
variability in drug effects. Even if causal relations between
variations and individual drug responses would be fully
unraveled, the rapid development of resistance to targeted
anticancer agents could represent a major challenge in
targeted cancer therapy. Such resistance often results

from secondary mutations of drug targets in cancer
cells. Acquired resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GISTs) through a secondary gene mutation in BCR-ABL
and KIT genes, respectively, are examples of the adaptive
capability of cancer cells to kinase inhibitors [178, 179].
Similarly, a dominant drug-resistant allele of mTOR
(S2035T) eliminates the cellular actions of Rapamycin
in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae [180]. It is not
excluded that although primary mTOR mutations are
barely observed in human cancers, the mTOR kinase could
be hit by a secondary or even a de novo gene mutation in
response to therapy as a self-defense mechanism.
In conclusion, although targeted therapy agents are
increasingly available for clinical applications, many of
these promising drugs have produced disappointing results
when tested in clinical trials. Because most tumors are
heterogeneous, a single drug regimen for patients with
the same tumor type/histology is not always appropriate.
Gene and protein signatures have been identified in several
diseases, but this information struggles to be translated
into clinically meaningful improvements. Nevertheless,
these observations can help defeat the challenge of
achieving individualized drug therapy, hopefully in the
near future.
