ABSTRACT
Amifostine (AM) is a radioprotector that scavenges free radicals and is used in
patients undergoing radiotherapy. p53 has long been implicated in cell cycle arrest for
cellular repair after radiation exposure. We therefore investigated the protective p53dependent mechanism of AM on small bowel damage after lethal whole-abdominal
irradiation (WAI). AM increased both the survival rate of rats and crypt survival
following lethal 18 Gy WAI. The p53 inhibitor PFT-α compromised AM-mediated effects
when administered prior to AM administration. AM significantly increased clonogenic
survival in IEC-6 cells expressing wild type p53 but not in p53 knockdown cells. AM
significantly increased p53 nuclear accumulation and p53 tetramer expression before
irradiation through the inhibition of p53 degradation. AM inhibited p53 interactions
with MDM2 but enhanced p53 interactions with 14-3-3σ. Knockdown of 14-3-3σ also
compromised the effect of AM on clonogenic survival and p53 nuclear accumulation
in IEC-6 cells. For the first time, our data reveal that AM alleviates lethal small bowel
damage through the induction of 14-3-3σ and subsequent accumulation of p53.
Enhancement of the p53/14-3-3σ interaction results in p53 tetramerization in the
nucleus that rescues lethal small bowel damage.

noted that small bowel volume was correlated with acute
diarrhea in patients with gynecological malignancies [1].
The effort to reduce small bowel toxicities is an important
issue for pelvic radiotherapy.
Pharmacological intervention has been considered
for the alleviation of small bowel toxicities, in addition
to dosimetric modulation of the small bowel volume.

INTRODUCTION
Radiotherapy plays an important role in definitive
and adjuvant therapy for many cancers. However,
radiotherapy-associated toxicity limits the delivery of large
doses of radiation. In patients with pelvic malignancies,
such as those in the uterus, rectum, bladder, or prostate,
small bowel toxicities are common during radiotherapy. We

and Storer found that WR-2721 exerted a radioprotective
effect in both the skin and bone marrow of mice without
increasing the radioresistance of the solid tumors [2].
Milas et al. also noted that WR-2721 could protect the
mouse jejunum [3]. However, it has been determined that
WR-2721 should be administered before irradiation to
exert its protective effect. The well-known radioprotective
mechanism of WR-2721 occurs via scavenging of free
radicals induced by radiation [4]. Murray et al. found that
free radical scavenging by WR-2721 may contribute to but
not fully explain the drug’s protective action [5].
Understanding the key mechanism of radiationinduced acute small bowel damage would aid in
determining the mechanism of AM-mediated protection.
p53 is an important molecule for the control of
acute small bowel damage after irradiation [6,7,8].
Interestingly, WR-1065, the active form of AM, binds to
p53 [9]. Tetramerization of p53 leads to its transcriptional
activation [10], and 14-3-3σ can increase p53 stabilization
[11,12]. Therefore, we were interested in the role of p53

in radioprotection by AM. Here, we show that p53 and
14-3-3σ cooperate with AM-mediated resistance to
radiation-induced small bowel damage.

RESULTS
Both AM and NAC attenuate initial oxidative
DNA damage
To examine the antioxidant role of AM, we used
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant thiocompound
similar to AM, to compare radiation-induced damage
between cells treated with these compounds. The compound
8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a marker of
oxidative DNA damage. We compared 8-OHdG levels
using flow cytometry between vehicle-, AM-, and NACtreated IEC-6 cells before and after 18 Gy irradiation, a
lethal dose for the small bowel of rats. Increased 8-OHdG
levels were noted 30 minutes after 18 Gy irradiation
compared with levels following 0 Gy irradiation. NACor AM-pretreated IEC-6 cells showed decreased levels of

for 60 minutes and irradiated (18 Gy). (A) Measurement of 8-OHdG among the 0 Gy (purple), 18 Gy (red), NAC plus 18 Gy (orange),

of 8-OHdG was assessed by immunofluorescence between different groups before and after irradiation. Cells were fixed 30 minutes after

8-OHdG after 18 Gy irradiation that were similar to the
levels in cells treated with 0 Gy (Figure 1A). Next, we used
immunofluorescence staining to examine the localization
of 8-OHdG in cells. The baseline distribution of 8-OHdG
in unirradiated cells was in the cytosol in the PBS, NAC,
and AM groups (Figure 1B). Irradiation of 18 Gy resulted
in the accumulation of 8-OHdG in the nucleus at
30  minutes, and treatment with either NAC or AM
attenuated the accumulation of 8-OHdG to levels observed
in the 0 Gy-irradiated cells (Figure 1B). In vivo confirmation
of oxidative stress in intestinal crypts was performed using
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 8-OHdG staining 24 hours
after 18 Gy WAI in rats. Irradiation increased 8-OHdG
staining in the crypts. NAC (200 mg/kg) or AM (200 mg/
kg) administered 30 minutes before 18 Gy whole-abdominal
irradiation (WAI) also equally alleviated oxidative stress
in the crypts of the jejunum (Figure 1C). We next used a
Comet assay to detect DNA damage in these three groups
at 5 minutes after 18 Gy irradiation. The data revealed that
18 Gy irradiation-induced DNA damage resulted in long
comet tails, while shortened tails were noted in IEC-6 cells
pretreated with NAC or AM (Figure 1D).

the survival rates, the effect of irradiation on mucosal
damage and recovery was less obvious in rats pretreated
with PFT-α (Figure 2C). Quantitative assessments of the
surviving crypts per circumflex were used to confirm the
histopathologic findings. We found that AM increased
the number of surviving crypts (p = 0.009) (Figure 2D).
The effect of AM on surviving crypts was less obvious
in rats that had been pretreated with PFT-α (p = 0.295)
(Figure  2D). We next used rat crypt cells (IEC-6) to
confirm the in vivo studies and further investigate these
mechanisms in vitro. First, siRNA was used to knock
down p53 in IEC-6 cells (Figure 3A), in which AM but not
NAC increased clonogenic survival (Figure 3B). However,
AM did not significantly improve clonogenic survival in
IEC-6 cells that had been transfected with p53 siRNA
(Figure 3C). These in vivo and in vitro results reveal that
AM requires p53 to cause the observed radioprotective
effects.

AM increases p53 expression before but not after
irradiation by delaying p53 degradation
Because the radioprotective effect of AM was p53
dependent, we further investigated whether AM could
increase p53 expression before or after irradiation.
IEC-6 cells were treated with AM or PBS for 60 minutes,
and the cells were then irradiated and incubated for
different lengths of time. We noted that AM increased p53
expression in IEC-6 cells before irradiation (Figure 4A).
However, no further increase in p53 expression after
irradiation was observed (Figure 4A). Increased p53
expression was noted 4 hours after irradiation and
returned to baseline levels by 48 hours in cells that had
not been treated with AM (Figure 4A). Therefore, we
examined p53 transcription in untreated and AM-treated
cells. Neither AM nor irradiation increased p53 mRNA
expression (Figure 4B). Because enhancement of p53
protein expression by AM did not occur due to an increase
in p53 mRNA expression, we considered that AM might
affect p53 degradation. We used cycloheximide to inhibit
protein synthesis in different types of intestinal cells to
study p53 degradation. AM delayed p53 degradation in
intestinal cells expressing wild type p53, including IEC-6
cells and HCT 116 cells (Figure 4C). The baseline levels
of p53 were also higher in AM-treated IEC-6 and HCT
116 cells. However, AM did not affect the baseline levels
of p53 and did not delay p53 degradation in intestinal cells
expressing mutant p53, including DLD-1 and COLO 205
cells (Figure 4D).

p53-dependent radioprotection of small bowel
damage by AM
Because p53 mediates small bowel protection
after irradiation [6,7,8] and AM has a radioprotective
effect on the small bowel [3], we investigated whether
the protective effect of AM is p53 dependent. We first
assessed the survival rate of different groups of rats given
lethal 18 Gy WAI. We also administered AM (200 mg/
kg) and NAC (200 mg/kg), a compound with a similar
effect to AM, to compare survival rates of rats treated
with these compounds. No rats survived after 18 Gy
WAI, and the median survival time was 3.5 days. NAC
prolonged the median survival time of the rats to 5 days,
although  the overall survival rate remained at 0%. The
overall survival rate in the AM group was 90%. Therefore,
AM significantly rescued mortality in the rats compared
with NAC (p < 0.001) (Figure 2A). To evaluate the role of
p53 in AM-mediated protection of small-bowel damage
after irradiation, we administered the p53 inhibitor PFT-α
[13] 5 minutes before AM administration. The overall
survival rate was 0% in the PFT-α group (median survival
= 4  days) and 20% in the PFT-α/AM group (median
survival = 5 days). The decrease in mortality induced by
AM was not significant (p = 0.057) (Figure 2B). Next,
we investigated whether the histopathology of the small
bowels of the rats was correlated with the survival data
from the different groups. Lethal irradiation induced
severe mucosal damage (H & E stain) and no mucosal
regeneration (BrdU uptake) 72 hours after 18 Gy WAI.
AM alleviated the mucosal damage and enhanced
recovery (Figure 2C) of the jejunum mucosa. Similar to

and these markers. After incubation with the proteasome

AM enhances p53 accumulation in the nucleus
but not the cytosol and increases transcriptional
activity

inhibition of p53 and MDM2 interaction. One important
molecule involved in these pathways is 14-3-3σ [11,12].
In situ PLA analysis was used to demonstrate that AM
enhanced the interaction between p53 and 14-3-3σ
(Figure 7A). We were interested in determining whether
p53 could increase 14-3-3σ expression; however, our
findings indicated that p53 did not increase the expression
of this molecule (Figure 7B). To investigate the
involvement of 14-3-3σ in p53-mediated radioprotection
by AM, we used siRNA to silence 14-3-3σ and found
that AM did not enhance p53 nuclear accumulation
(Figure 7C). In IEC-6 cells treated with 14-3-3σ shRNA,
AM did not significantly protect against radiation-induced
cell death (Figure 7D). Furthermore, AM enhanced
nuclear expression of 14-3-3σ in the crypts of the jejunum
24 hours after 18 Gy WAI (Figure 7E).

Because the majority of p53 degradation occurs in
the cytosol and our data revealed that AM did not affect the
interactions between p53 and ubiquitin or p53 and NQO1,
the export signals of p53 were investigated. To assess
whether AM caused p53 accumulation in the nucleus, we
used immunofluorescent microscopy to observe the location
of p53 in AM-treated cells and found that AM enhanced the
nuclear localization of p53 (Figure 6A). We also analyzed
p53 expression in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of
cell lysates before and after irradiation. AM increased
p53 expression in the nucleus but not the cytosol before
irradiation (Figure 6B). However, AM did not significantly
increase p53 expression in the nucleus 0.5 and 4 hours
after irradiation compared with pre-irradiation levels. p53
tetramer formation plays a role in transcriptional activity
[10]. Therefore, we investigated whether AM enhances p53
tetramerization and transcription. We used glutaraldehyde
(GA), a protein crosslinker, to study p53 tetramerization
[19] and found that AM increased p53 tetramer formation
(Figure 6C). To investigate whether AM has a direct effect
on p53 tetramerization, we used exogenous recombinant
human p53 in a cell-free system and found that AM
increased p53 tetramerization (Figure 6D). AM also
enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53 in both IEC-6
and HCT 116 cells (Figure 6E).

DISCUSSION
Acute lethal radiation injuries are complex, and
studies have demonstrated that total body irradiation
typically presents with gastrointestinal (GI) and/or
hematopoietic (HP) syndromes. The causes of death
are dependent on the dose and types of tissues affected.
In general, the LD50 of bone marrow is approximately
6-7 Gy. GI syndrome arises after an irradiation dose of
8  Gy or greater, and the threshold of the lethal dose is
15 Gy [20]. When the survival of an animal is used as an
endpoint in a study, it is difficult to distinguish the cause
of death as GI or HP syndrome using total body irradiation
greater than 15 Gy. Therefore, WAI rather than total body
irradiation is suitable for the study of radiation-induced
lethal small bowel damage. The LD50 for rats is lower
than that for mice [21]. The survival rate was previously
reported as approximately 60% for mice receiving 16.95

Gy of abdominal irradiation [6]. In our experience, 12
Gy WAI resulted in reversible small bowel damage [22],
and in the current study, 18 Gy WAI resulted in lethal and
irreversible small bowel damage.
Drugs that can rescue lethal radiation injury are rare.
The effectiveness of such drugs exists only at radiation
doses less than 15 Gy [7,23,24] that do not induce lethal
small bowel damage. The destructive mechanism of
radiation may be via the attenuation of bone marrow more
than via GI damage. Kirsch et al. found that p53 controls
radiation-induced GI syndrome in mice independently of
apoptosis [6]. In the study, tissue-specific inhibition of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptotic signals could not protect against small bowel
damage after irradiation [6]. An investigation into more
effective drugs for the protection of lethal radiationinduced small bowel damage is attractive.
AM (WR-2721) is a phosphorylated prodrug that is
dephosphorylated in tissues to its active form, WR-1025,
to scavenge free radicals formed by radiation through
membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (AP) [4]. Earlier
studies on the pharmacokinetic distribution of WR-2721
suggested that WR-2721 distributes in normal tissues
rather than in tumors, resulting in selective normal tissue
protection [2]. Although protection of the small bowel by
9763

Oncotarget

AM has previously been investigated [3,5], the endpoints
in such studies have typically relied on crypt survival and
mucosal damage. Only one study presented a 54% survival
rate for mice using 150 mg/kg of AM following 13 Gy of
total body irradiation [23]. However, the dose of AM in
that study was not very effective [3]. In the present study,
we used 18 Gy as the lethal dose for abdominal irradiation.
Although this dose was higher than that in most studies
investigating radiation-induced small bowel damage, AM
could rescue most of the irradiated rats from death.
AM can scavenge hydroxyl radicals but not
superoxide in vitro [25] and can scavenge ROS in
vivo [26]. To exclude the effect of general free radical
scavenging in this study, we chose NAC as a control, given
its reported role as an antioxidant and a strong scavenger
of hydroxyl radicals [27]. Because 1 Gy produces 0.27 μM
hydroxyl radicals in neutral water [28], it is possible that
18 Gy of radiation induces an amount of hydroxyl radicals
(estimated as 4.86 μM) that is too small to detect large
differences compared with 0 Gy treatment in the present
experiments. NAC and AM similarly reduced the levels
of hydroxyl radicals after 18 Gy irradiation. Although
the initial DNA damage was similar between AM and
NAC, the survival rates of IEC-6 cells and rats were
better following AM treatment than for NAC treatment.
These results are consistent with a study that reported that
WR-1065 (4 mM) but not NAC (4 mM) protected human
microvascular endothelial cells after 8 Gy irradiation
[29]. In addition, the data suggested that PFT-α and p53
knockdown attenuated the effect of AM. Under conditions
of p53 inhibition, the radioprotective effect of AM was
considered to be due to ROS scavenging. The effect of
p53 induction on survival might be more involved than
ROS scavenging alone. Therefore, ROS scavengingindependent effects of AM may play an important role in
radioprotection based on data examining p53 inhibition.
Our results support the hypothesis that p53 mediates
radiation-induced small bowel damage [6].
Surprisingly, p53 accumulated in IEC-6 cells
60 minutes after AM administration. This finding is
consistent with a study in MCF-7 cells that revealed that
AM enhanced binding of p53 to DNA [30]. AM also
increased p53 expression [30,31], with this enhancement
occurring as early as 30 minutes and persisting to 90
minutes. Cassatt et al. found that WR-1065 levels in the
small intestine of rats reached a plateau at approximately
15 minutes following the intravenous administration of AM
and remained at that level for approximately 90 minutes
[32]. Because the uptake of AM into cells occurs within 15
minutes and intracellular levels of AM are maintained for
up to 90 minutes [33], p53 expression had sufficient time
to increase before irradiation began. Our data confirmed
the results of these studies. In our study, the incubation
time of AM was 1 hour for IEC-6 cells. Even at 2 hours
after 18 Gy irradiation, p53 was not significantly induced.
However, pretreatment with AM increased p53 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cells 2 hours after irradiation compared with no AM
pretreatment. Increased p53 expression by AM may explain
the radioprotective effect of AM because p53 mediates
radiation-induced small bowel damage [6]. Hence, AM
may mimic p53 overexpression in vitro and in vivo based
on findings from the present study. An in vivo study [13]
using PFT-α to inhibit p53 transactivation confirmed that
AM acts via the activation of p53 downstream genes.
Induction of p53, by causing arrest [31], protects normal
cells from cycle-dependent chemotherapy or radiation. At
the same time, these p53-inducing agents did not protect
cancer cells with mutant p53 [34-37]. Such selective
protection can extend therapeutic window.
Our investigation of the potential rapid induction of
p53 by AM examined known pathways of degradation of
p53. However, NQO1 and ubiquitin were not involved in
the delay of p53 degradation by AM. We suggest that the
dynamics of p53 synthesis and degradation in the cytosol is
not changed by AM. Therefore, the inhibition of p53 export
may be the mechanism underlying the effect of AM on p53.
The nuclear but not cytosolic accumulation of p53 supports
our hypothesis. Because tetramerization of p53 leads to p53
transcriptional activation [10], it was important to investigate
the role of AM in p53 tetramerization. Our data revealed
that p53 tetramerization and transcriptional activity were
increased by AM. MDM2 is associated with p53 export
[19,38], and the interaction of MDM2 with p53 was inhibited
by AM in our results. 14-3-3σ can inhibit the interaction
between MDM2 and p53 and increase p53 stabilization
[11,12]. 14-3-3σ is required to prevent mitotic catastrophe
after DNA damage [39]. We noted that AM enhanced the
interaction between 14-3-3σ and p53. Therefore, 14-3-3σ
may play a role in AM-medicated regulation of nuclear
p53 accumulation. To investigate the role of 14-3-3σ in
AM-mediated radioprotection, we knocked down 143-3σ and found that the knockdown compromised the
effects of AM, including nuclear accumulation of p53, and
increased clonogenic survival. Even in a cell-free system,
AM enhanced p53 tetramer formation. Taken together, our
data suggest that AM first increases tetramer formation and
subsequently enhances the interaction between p53 and 143-3σ, which normally inhibits p53 degradation and enhances
p53 transcriptional activity. Subsequent radioprotection
by increased p53 expression prior to lethal small bowel
irradiation is an important mechanism induced by AM. It is
worth identifying specific drugs that enhance the p53/14-33σ interaction in the nucleus and thus alleviate small bowel
damage.

METHODS
Cell culture and drug administration
IEC-6 (CRL-1592), HCT 116 (CCL-247), COLO
205 (CCL-222), DLD-1 (CCL-221), and HEK293T (CRL11268) cells were purchased from the American Type
9764

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in suggested
media (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) and
antibiotics (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) at 37°C under
an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The media was changed every
3 days, and cells were passaged by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA
(Gibco Life Technologies, USA). Subconfluent cancer
cells were cultured in a 25T flask for further experiments.
The combination of AM (4 mM) and AP (1 U/ml) to form
active WR1065 was based on a study by Smoluk et al.
[40]. Washout of AM and AP was performed 60 minutes
after drug administration or irradiation.

IEC-6 cells were resuspended using the REzolTM
C&T reagent (Protech Technologies, Taiwan), and
total cellular RNA was extracted according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA samples were assessed
for quantification and purity by A260/A280 absorption,
and RNA samples with ratios greater than 1.8 were stored
at −80°C for further analysis. RT-PCR was performed
using a MMLV-Reverse Transcriptase kit (EPICENTRE®
Biotechnologies, Wisconsin, USA). To synthesize
complementary DNA (cDNA), 2 μg RNA was resuspended
in 14.5 μL of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, 1.5 μL
of oligo(dT) primer, 3 μL of 0.1 M DTT, 3 μL of 10× RT
buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, and 0.75 M KCl,
pH 8.3), 6 μL of 2.5 mM dNTP, 0.5 μL of RNase inhibitor,
and 1 μL of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (MMLV RT). The reaction mixture was
incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C to synthesize the DNA
strand, and the reaction was stopped by denaturing the
enzyme at 85°C for 5 minutes. One microgram of cDNA
was used for PCR amplification (Promega, Madison,
WI) in a reaction volume of 20 μL containing 2 μL 10x
PCR Buffer, 0.25 μL 10 mM dNTP, 0.2 μL Taq, 0.5 μL
of each specific primer, and sterile water. The conditions
for the rat p53 RT-PCR experiments were as follows: the
reaction mixture was heated to 94°C for 2 minutes, and
the amplification was performed for 25 cycles of 94°C for
1.5 minutes, 60°C for 50 s, and 72°C for 50 s on a thermal
cycler; and the reaction mixture was then heated at 72°C
for 5 minutes. The rat GAPDH conditions were as follows:
the reaction mixture was heated to 94°C for 2 minutes,
and the amplification was performed for 25 cycles of
94°C for 1.5 minutes, 54°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 50 s
on a thermal cycler; and the reaction mixture was then
heated at 72°C for 5 minutes. The primers used for the rat
p53 experiments were as follows: forward: 5’-TCT GTC
ATC TTC CGT CCC TTC TC-3’, and reverse: 5’-AAC
ACG AAC CTC AAA GCT GTC CCG-3’. Primers for rat
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH):
forward: 5’-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3’, and
reverse: 5’-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3’.
Amplified DNA (10 μL of the PCR mixture) was resolved
on a 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis and visualized
under UV illumination.

Determination of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine
(8-OHdG) levels by flow cytometry
The manufacturer’s protocols were followed for the
following experiments. Briefly, 1×105–5×105 cells were
harvested, transferred to polystyrene flow cytometry tubes,
washed with PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 mL of
PBS. After 0.5 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde was added,
the solution was placed on ice for 15 minutes. The cells
were washed twice with 0.1% BSA solution, resuspended
in 1 mL of ice-cold 90% ethanol to permeabilize the
cells, and stored at −20°C until analysis. After washing,
nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with
blocking solution at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing,
diluted concentrations (1:50) of primary antibody specific
for 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxy-guanosine [N45.1] (ab48508,
Abcam Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK)
were incubated with the cells for 1 hour in the dark at
37°C. After additional washing, diluted concentrations
(1:100) of FITC-conjugated antibodies specific for KLH
(ab34766, Abcam Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge,
UK) or negative control anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated IgG
antibodies were incubated with the cells for 30 minutes
in the dark at 37°C. After washing, the cells were rinsed,
resuspended, and analyzed with a fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (FACSCalibur system, Becton Dickinson).
Fluorescence readings were obtained for 104 cells for each
set of experiments and analyzed with CellQuest Software.

siRNA transfection
Cells were seeded in media without antibiotics.
After 24 hours, 10 μL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
was incubated for 5 minutes with 240 μL Opti-MEM
(Invitrogen). Next, 0.2 nmol (100 nM) of non-specific
(Invitrogen), p53-specific siRNA (sc-45917, Santa
Cruz biotechnology, CA), or 14-3-3σ-specific siRNA
(SR503571, OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD)
was resuspended in 250 μL Opti-MEM and combined
with Lipofectamine 2000. After 20 minutes, 500 μL of
the siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mix was added to cells
with 1.5 mL Opti-MEM. Six hours later, complete growth
media was added.

Whole cell protein extract
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS,
1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8) with
1 mM PMSF, 8.5 μg/mL aprotinin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin,
1× complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting

(WAI). Vehicle, AM (200 mg/kg, i.p.), or NAC (200 mg/
kg, i.p.) was administered 30 minutes before WAI. PFT-α
(2.2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 5 minutes before AM
administration. The details of the WAI were described in
a previous study [22]. To determine 8-OHdG and 14-3-3σ
expression, rats under different conditions were killed 24
hours after WAI, and a segment of the distal jejunum was
obtained. For the determination of crypt survival, BrdU
(100 mg/kg, i.p) was administered 70 hours after WAI;
additionally, rats under different conditions were killed 72
hours after WAI, and a segment of the distal jejunum was
obtained. For the survival observations, the animals were
fed normally and observed.

Co-IP was performed using the Catch and Release
v2.0 Reversible Immunoprecipitation System (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Binding of p53 to MDM2 was detected
by immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis. In brief, whole
cell extracts for immunoprecipitation experiments were
carried out using a primary antibody to MDM2 (SMP
14; sc-45917, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) or p53
(FL-393; sc-6243, Santa Cruz biotechnology, CA).
Typically, 500 μg of lysate was incubated with 4 μg of
MDM2 or p53-specific antibody overnight at 4°C. The
immunoprecipitates or protein extracts (50 μg) from
cells were heated at 94°C for 3 minutes, resolved by 10%
SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes
using semi-dry transfer. The membranes were blocked
for 1 hour at room temperature with PBS containing 5%
milk powder, incubated with primary antibody diluted
for p53 (1C12; #2524, cell signaling technology),
MDM2 (SMP 14; sc-45917, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA), ubiquitin (ab7780, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or
14-3-3σ (E-11; sc-166473, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA) and subsequently incubated with anti- β-actin
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(diluted concentration 1:5000) at room temperature for 50
minutes. Immunoblots were then probed with the mouse
monoclonal anti-p53 antibody. MDM2 expression was
determined using the same membrane after stripping the
immune complexes used for the detection of p53.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The paraffin sections (3 μm-thick) were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen
retrieval. Antigen retrieval was achieved by incubation
in a water bath at 95°C for 30 minutes (for 8-OHdG or
14-3-3σ) or by incubation with 1 N HCl for 60 minutes
at 40°C, followed by treatment with 0.1% trypsin for
20 minutes (for BrdU). To block endogenous peroxidase
activity and nonspecific binding sites, the sections were
incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. The
sections were incubated with primary antibodies directed
against 8-OHdG (ab48508, Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
14-3-3σ (sc-166473, Santa Cruz), and BrdU (MAB5404,
Chemicon) at dilutions of 1:3000, 1:2000, and 1:1000,
respectively, for 60 minutes. After washing, the sections
were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse detection system (Dako
REAL EnVision, Dako Inc., Denmark) for 30 minutes
and visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). As a
negative control, another set of sections stained without
primary antibodies were subjected to incubation with
secondary antibodies, DAB treatment, and hematoxylin
staining.

Irradiation and clonogenic assay
Cells under different conditions (scrambled RNA,
siRNA, or overexpression) were irradiated in 25T
flasks. For the clonogenic assay, 0, 12, and 18 Gy were
delivered using a linear accelerator. Cells (100-10,000/
well, according to the radiation dose) were plated in sixwell plates immediately following irradiation. At the 1 to
2 weeks following the irradiation, glutaraldehyde (6.0%
v/v) and crystal violet (0.5% w/v) were added to fix
and stain the colonies, respectively. Cells were counted
using a stereomicroscope. A colony was considered
to be surviving when 50 or more cells were counted.
Normalization to 0 Gy in each condition was performed
according to the plating efficiency (PE). The surviving
fraction equaled the number of colonies/(number of cells
plated × PE). The survival curve was drawn according to
the survival rate (log) and dose.

Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared
using Cayman’s Nuclear Extraction Kit (Cayman
Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI; item no. 10009277).
The purity of the fractions was determined using β-actin
as a cytosolic marker and lamin A/C as a nuclear marker.

Protein decay analysis
Cells were pre-treated with vehicle or 4 mM AM in
addition to AP (1 U/mL) for 60 minutes, and the medium
was then replaced with fresh medium. After treatment
with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) for different durations (15 to 240 minutes),
the cells were harvested, and the whole cell lysates were
processed for immunoblot analysis of p53 and β-actin.

Animals, drug administration, and irradiation
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (300-400 g) were
used for lethal irradiation. The animal protocol was
approved by the animal care committee at our institution.
Rats were subjected to 18 Gy whole-abdominal irradiation

Oligomerization assay

incubated with 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 3 minutes and
then rinsed with PBS. Finally, the cells were mounted on a
coverslip with a drop of mounting medium. The cells were
observed using a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer
Z1, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Welwyn Garden City,
UK) and photographed using an integrated camera with
the appropriate filter for detection.

IEC-6 cells and HCT 116 cells were treated with
or without 4 mM AM in addition to AP (1 U/ml) for
60 minutes. Equal amounts of cell lysates were treated
without or with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of
0.008%, 0.016%, or 0.09% for 2 to 5 minutes at 37°C. The
reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μL of 1 M
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cross-linked proteins were solubilized
by the addition of an equal volume of 4x XT sample
buffer, and SDS-PAGE was conducted in a 6% to 12%
gel. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot analysis
for p53 dimerization and tetramerization.

Stable knockdown of 14-3-3σ
We used HEK293T cells for the transient
transfections and for the production of all recombinant
retroviruses following the manufacturer’s instructions
(HuSHTM shRNA plasmid panels application guide).
Briefly, the packing cells were allowed to reach 70-80%
confluency and were cotransfected with 1 μg of Rattus
norvegicus 14-3-3σ (LOC298795) shRNA plasmid
(constructs were in the retroviral pGFP-V-RS vector
(SRTG702077, OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD)
with TurboFect in vitro Transfection Reagent (Fermentas).
The cells were incubated with fresh media the next day,
and on day two post-transfection we collected the media
from the cultures and either centrifuged the media at
2000 x g for 5 minutes or passed it through a 0.45 μm
filter to remove cell debris. The supernatant was frozen
at −80°C or directly used as a viral stock to determine
viral titers. The viral titers were calculated 72 h after
transfection by counting the number of GFP-expressing
foci divided by the dilution factor. For viral infections,
IEC-6 cells were plated and had reached approximately
50% confluency after 24 hours. The entire amount of viral
stock and polybrene (8 μg/mL) in growth medium was
added directly onto target cells and incubated at 37°C
in 5% CO2. At 24 hours post-infection, the medium was
replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10%
FBS. Puromycin (0.5-1 μg/mL) was used for selection;
at the lowest drug concentration, puromycin resulted in
massive cell death after 3 days and killed all the cells
within 2 weeks. IEC-6 cells were plated into 96-well
plates (1 × 103 cells per well) in limiting dilutions and
allowed to adhere for 16 hours. A selective medium with
400 to 600 ng/ml of puromycin was added to the stable
cell lines the next day.

Ubiquitination assay
IEC-6 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding
HA-tagged ubiquitin and pcDNA3 encoding WT MDM2.
The cells were treated with 20 μg/mL MG132 (Sigma) for
4 hours, harvested, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), and
lysed in 150 μL of RIPA-buffer. p53-ubiquitinated proteins
were targeted with an anti-p53 antibody and subjected to
10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis.

Immunostaining
Cells samples were immunostained to visualize
p53, 8-OHdG, MDM2, and 14-3-3σ according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described
(double immunofluorescence-simultaneous protocol,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Next, 5 x 103 cells were placed
onto 3 cm coated coverslips in dishes for cell culture.
The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 minutes and washed two times with ice-cold PBS
buffer for 5 minutes each. The samples were incubated
for 10 minutes in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100
for permeabilization, and the cells were then washed
in PBS three times for 5 min. The cells were incubated
with 2% BSA in PBST for 30 minutes to block unspecific
binding of the antibodies. The cells were incubated
in either a primary antibody such as p53 (PAb 240)
(ab26, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), p53 (1C12) (Alexa
Fluor-488 conjugate,#2015, Cell signaling technology,
Mölndal, Sweden), 14-3-3σ (N-14) (sc-166473, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA) or a mixture of two primary
antibodies in 1% BSA in PBST in a humidified chamber
for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
The solution was decanted, and the cells were washed
three times in PBST for 5 minutes each. The cells were
incubated with either a secondary antibody or a mixture of
two secondary antibodies produced in animals of different
species with two different fluorochromes (i.e., anti-mouse
Texas Red-conjugated and anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated
antibodies) in 1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature in
the dark. The mixture containing the secondary antibodies
was decanted, and the cells were wash three times with
PBST for 5 minutes each in the dark. The cells were

Comet assay
Procedures were followed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions of the CometAssay kit
(Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) as described
previously [41]. Following electrophoresis, the slide was
stained with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) diluted 1:10,000 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA. The images were observed and captured by
fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer Z1, Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging, Inc., Welwyn Garden City, UK) with a
490 nm filter.

p53 transcription factor assays
Commercial kits (TransAM p53 Transcription Factor
Assay Kits, Active Motif, North America) were used to
quantify p53 activation according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, nuclear extracts were placed in a
96-well plate with immobilized oligonucleotides
containing the p53 consensus binding site. A primary
antibody against an epitope of p53 that is exposed upon
DNA binding and a secondary antibody conjugated to
HRP were added to provide a chemiluminescent readout,
and the results were quantified using a spectrophotometer
(Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer, Thermo Scientific)
at 450 nm with reference wavelength of 655 nm.

Statistics
Comparisons of samples in the clonogenic assays
and comparisons of p53 transcriptional activity of each
pair of samples were performed using paired t-tests. The
number of surviving crypts in small bowels between the
AM and no AM groups was compared using the Student’s
t-test. Survival analysis was calculated by the KaplanMeier method, and significant differences were tested by a
log-rank test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
