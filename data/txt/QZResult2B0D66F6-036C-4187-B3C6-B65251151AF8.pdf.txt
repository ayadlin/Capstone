BACKGROUND: Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are similar pathobiologically to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in older adults. AML therapies thus may have activity in MDS. In the current study, phase 2
study data of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in CD33-positive patients with MDS and secondary AML (sAML) were presented. METHODS: Between June 2004 and February 2006, 30 patients with higherrisk MDS or sAML received ATO (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg intravenously for 5 days during Week 1, then twice weekly
during Weeks 2-12) and GO (at a dose of 3 mg/m2 on Day 8) for 1 or 2 cycles of 12 weeks each. The primary endpoint
was response as per MDS or AML International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Adverse events were collected
throughout treatment. Patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years for survival. RESULTS: The median patient
age was 69 years. A total of 18 patients had MDS, 12 had sAML, and 19 had been previously treated. Seventeen
patients (57%) completed 1 cycle, and 7 patients (23%) completed 2 cycles. IWG responses occurred in 9 patients
(30%) according to IWG MDS criteria (including 2 of 7 patients who failed hypomethylating agents) and 3 of 12 AML
patients (25%) according to IWG AML criteria. Grade 3/4 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria [version 3.0]) thrombocytopenia occurred in 47% of patients, neutropenia in 63%, and anemia in 37% of
patients. The median overall survival was 9.7 months (28.6 months in responders and 7.6 months in nonresponders; P
<.001). Patients who completed 2 cycles of therapy spent a median of 13 days in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with ATO and GO was found to have acceptable response rates and toxicity, and may be a viable
treatment option to standard induction therapy, particularly for patients who fail therapy with hypomethylating

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a spectrum of bone marrow disorders now considered to be cancers
by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, with a yearly incidence rate in the United States of 3.4 per 100,000 citizens, or >10,000 new diagnoses yearly.1 Within subcategories of
MDS, refractory anemia (RA), refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with or without ringed sideroblasts, or
MDS associated with an isolated del(5q) abnormality can persist for years, and are considered lower-risk MDS, representing the majority of MDS diagnoses.2-5 As oncogenes are activated and tumor suppressor genes inactivated, genetic lesions

accumulate and lower-risk MDS becomes proliferative or
higher-risk MDS, and eventually acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), believed to be facilitated through ras, FMS, and
p53 mutations.6 RA with excess blasts (RAEB) or RAEB
in transformation to leukemia (RAEB-T,)7 run accelerated courses, and are referred to as higher-risk MDS.7-11
Bone marrow findings in patients with higher-risk
MDS are similar to those found in patients with AML,
particularly AML occurring in older adults. MDS-associated myeloblasts are just as likely to express CD33, which
is found in 90% of patients with AML.12 Moreover,
adults with higher-risk MDS demonstrate striking cytogenetic similarities to older adults with AML.13-15 Thus,
therapies that are effective in patients with AML may also
demonstrate activity in patients with advanced MDS and
secondary AML (sAML), and outpatient regimens in particular have appeal over standard remission induction
therapies, which have limited efficacy and require a prolonged inpatient stay.16
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an anti-CD33
monoclonal antibody covalently linked to calicheamicin,
a cytotoxic agent. It causes double-strand DNA breaks
when internalized into the myeloblast nucleus, and results
in a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi) in approximately 29% of older AML
patients in first recurrence.17,18 Arsenic trioxide (ATO)
works through apoptotic and pro-differentiating mechanisms, and has been shown to inhibit the production of
vascular endothelial growth factor.19-21 Used as a single
agent in patients with MDS, it produced a hematologic
response rate of approximately 20%.22,23
On the basis of the data demonstrating limited efficacy using ATO and GO as single agents in patients with
AML and MDS, we conducted a phase 2 study of combination therapy in patients with higher-risk MDS or AML
arising from MDS (sAML) because ATO may downregulate inhibitors of apoptosis in bone marrow blasts,
allowing for enhanced cytotoxicity by GO.

pathologic classification with 5% CD33-positive myeloblasts or AML arising from MDS (with CD33-positive
myeloblasts) and not have received previous remission
induction therapy.2-4,24 Cytogenetic analyses were based
on 20 metaphase divisions, and risk classifications were
performed according to IPSS designations for MDS
patients and per Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) 8461 for AML patients.25 All diagnoses were
confirmed at 1 of the 2 participating institutions. Additional inclusion criteria were age >18 years; an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0, 1, or 2; serum
potassium 4.0 mEq/dL and serum magnesium >1.8
mg/dL; and an absolute QTc interval <460 milliseconds.
Patients could not be pregnant or lactating; could not be
candidates for bone marrow transplantation or have
undergone bone marrow transplantation in the past; must
not have received another investigational or approved
therapy for MDS within 4 weeks of study enrollment,
including growth factors; must not have received prior
therapy with either ATO or GO; must have had a life expectancy of at least 4 months; must have had adequate renal and hepatic function; and must not have had a prior
history of malignancy other than MDS unless free of disease for 3 years. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov identifier #NCT00274781.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This multicenter trial was approved by the institutional
review boards of the Cleveland Clinic and the University
of Michigan, and conducted from February 2004 through
June 2006. Enrolled patients had to have a diagnosis of
higher-risk MDS, defined as an International Prognostic
Scoring System (IPSS) score 1.5 or a French-AmericanBritish (FAB) or World Health Organization (WHO)

Study Design
Although to our knowledge there are no phase 1 data
establishing a maximum tolerated dose for the combination of ATO and GO, toxicities of the 2 agents were
believed to be sufficiently non-overlapping to support
empiric combination dosing based on previous studies of
the single agents. Thus, ATO dosing was based on the
phase 2 European Union regimen23 at a dose of 0.25 mg/

kg administered intravenously on Days 1 through 5 during Week 1 and then twice weekly during Weeks 2 to 12,
and GO at a dose of 3 mg/m2 on Day 8 for 1 or 2 cycles of
12 weeks each (Fig. 1). The doses of GO were similar to
those used in phase 1 studies in patients with recurrent or
refractory AML in which patients achieved a CR,18 yet
were lower than the standard dose of 9 mg/m2 given to
patients with MDS in a phase 2, multicenter trial to minimize toxicity. Regular conferences were held in which the
investigators reviewed toxicities and made a determination of whether study continuation was ethical. One such
mandated conference occurred after enrollment of the
first 6 patients to determine whether toxicities were acceptable to continue enrollment. Patients who demonstrated stable disease or improvement on a Week 12 bone
marrow biopsy received a second 12-week cycle, and then
another Week 24 biopsy. Patients did not receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or growth factors while on the
study. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0) over
the entire course of therapy.
Statistics and Efficacy Assessments
The primary endpoint was response as defined by the
Modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria
for MDS26 or, for AML patients, the IWG response criteria for AML.27 The null hypothesis to be tested was that
the percentage of patients who will respond to combination GO and ATO therapy is <10%. A total of 9
responses observed in 30 evaluable patients was taken as
evidence warranting further study of the regimen, provided the toxicity profile also appears favorable. This
design had a significance level (probability of falsely
declaring that ATO warrants further study when the true
response rate is 10%) of .10, and power (probability of
correctly declaring that the combination of GO and ATO
warranted further study when the true response rate was
30%) of 0.80. Baseline characteristics were reported as
medians with ranges, as was survival, which was measured
from the date of study enrollment until death or study
closure for follow-up (March 2009). Survival differences
were calculated using the Student t test.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Thirty patients were enrolled; baseline characteristics are
presented in Table 1. The median age was 69 years, and 9
patients (30%) were female. Eighteen patients (60%) had

MDS (5 with RAEB-1, 10 with RAEB-2, and 3 with
CMML-2,). Twelve patients (40%) had AML with cytogenetic risk groups as defined by CALGB 8461: intermediate
(7 patients), adverse (3 patients), and unknown/no growth
(2 patients). IPSS classifications for all patients were high
(16 patients), intermediate-2 (9 patients), intermediate-1 (3
patients), and unclassifiable (2 patients), whereas IPSS cytogenetic risk classifications for MDS patients were good (6
patients), intermediate (4 patients), poor (4 patients), and
no growth (4 patients). Patients had a median of 15% blasts
(11.5% for those with MDS and 43.5% for those with
AML). Patients carried a diagnosis of MDS/AML a median
of 5 months before trial entry. Fifteen patients received prior
therapies, including growth factors (10 patients), azacitidine
(5 patients), hydroxyurea (3 patients), prednisone (1
patient), anagrelide (1 patient), thalidomide (1 patient), and
lenalidomide (1 patient).
Treatment Tolerability
Of the 30 patients enrolled, 17 (57%) completed a single
12-week cycle of therapy, 7 of whom (23%) completed two
12-week cycles. Reasons for discontinuing therapy during
the first cycle included patient/physician choice (5 patients),
progressive disease (5 patients), or treatment toxicity (3
patients). Reasons for discontinuing therapy after the first
cycle included progressive disease (8 patients) and toxicity
(2 patients). Overall, adverse events of any grade were experienced by 100% of patients (Table 2). Serious (grade 3 or
4) hematologic events occurred in 63% of patients, as would
be expected with myelotoxic therapy, and included neutropenia in 19 patients (63%), thrombocytopenia in 14
patients (47%), and anemia in 11 patients (37%). Serious
nonhematologic toxicities included pneumonia in 5 patients
(17%), fatigue in 4 patients (13%), dyspnea in 4 patients
(13%), QT/QTc prolongation in 3 patients (10%), and
gastrointestinal toxicities in 2 patients (7%).
Treatment Efficacy
Responses occurred in 9 patients (30%) (Table 3) according to the IWG MDS criteria, in 3 of 12 AML patients
(25%) according to the IWG AML criteria, and in 3
patients (10%) by both criteria. Using the modified IWG
MDS criteria, 3 patients achieved a partial response, 3
achieved a neutrophil response, 2 achieved a platelet
response, and 1 achieved both platelet and neutrophil
responses. Using the IWG AML criteria, 3 patients with
AML achieved a partial response. Two of 7 patients previously treated with hypomethylating agents, such as

those patients who have already failed 1 of these diseasemodifying therapies, and for the particularly at-risk population of patients with sAML arising out of MDS.
We studied a novel combination of drugs, each of
which has demonstrated activity in MDS and/or AML.
The justification for this strategy rested on the hypothesis
that patients with higher-risk MDS and sAML, in which
pro-proliferative mechanisms of disease potentiation predominate, and in whom excess myeloblasts (evident in every patient enrolled onto the current study) are just as
likely to express CD33 as are myeloblasts in patients with
AML, also retained properties of the lower-risk MDS
from which their disease likely evolved, in which bone
marrow microenvironment and a block in differentiation
also play major roles. Thus, the use of 2 agents with complementary mechanisms of action may yield additive
benefit.
The combination of ATO and GO was found to be
well tolerated. It had a toxicity profile that was manageable, with the expected hematologic adverse events that
accompany myelosuppressive therapy and nonhematologic toxicities occurring at an expected rate for this population of older adults with advanced disease, and similar to
that noted in other studies of disease-modifying therapies
in older, higher-risk populations with MDS and sAML.
Because this was designed to be a phase 2 study, no dose
escalation was planned; given the acceptable toxicity profile, it would be reasonable to administer GO at higher
doses (such as 9 mg/m2 once or twice per cycle) in subsequent phase studies.

The combination of ATO and GO also was found
to be effective, yielding partial and hematologic responses,
particularly with regard to neutrophil and platelet counts,
in 30% of patients. There were no discernable clinical
characteristics that would have distinguished responders
from nonresponders a priori. This response rate compared
favorably with the hematologic improvement rate of 19%
(17% in higher-risk patients) noted in a European phase 2
study by Vey et al of arsenic trioxide in MDS, and with a
US study by Schiller et al reporting a hematologic
improvement rate of 20% (6% in higherrisk patients), with similar toxicities.22,23
Among those patients who had been treated previously with azacitidine, 2 of 7 experienced an IWG
hematologic improvement, which is comparable to the
response rate noted with, for example, clofarabine in
patients similarly exposed to hypomethylating agents.28
Also similar to the azacitidine survival study, patients
treated for a longer period of time appeared to have a better survival, although to some extent this may have been a
self-fulfilling prophesy, because these patients also tended
to be responders.
Perhaps most importantly, for patients with higherrisk MDS and sAML who might reasonably be treated
with remission-inducing, cytarabine-based therapy as
inpatients, this combination may be a viable outpatient alternative. In the current study, patients treated for the longest period of time spent a median of only 13 days in the
hospital, compared with the initial 4 to 6 weeks they
would have spent had they undergone cytoreductive
therapy.
At the time this study was conducted, azacitidine
had not yet been demonstrated to improve survival in a
similar patient population when compared with conventional care regimens16; thus, we considered it ethical to
enroll such patients onto this combination as front-line
therapy. The azacitidine study established overall survival
as the benchmark for efficacy in the higher-risk MDS/
AML population. The median overall survival in the current study was similar to the population treated on the
azacitidine study. Whether there is an advantage of the
combination regimen or single-agent azacitidine, in terms
of toxicities or efficacy, can only be determined in a comparative study.
Another viable outpatient approach would be to
treat older AML patients with low-dose cytarabine, as has
been done by the United Kingdom Medical Research
Council (MRC).29 It is difficult to make absolute direct
comparisons because the majority of patients enrolled in

1259

Original Article

the current study had MDS and not AML, and the AML
patients enrolled on this study all had sAML, a group that
comprised only 26% of the patients enrolled in the study
by Burnett et al. Thus, the CR rate of 18% for low-dose
cytarabine in patients with AML in the MRC study by
Burnett et al would not necessarily translate to the population being studied herein. The median overall survival for
patients enrolled in the current study who achieved a
response, 28.6 months, is favorable when compared with
the median overall survival of CR patients enrolled in the
study by Burnett et al (575 days). Nevertheless, it is difficult to know whether, had we designed a phase 3 study,
the combination would be any better than low-dose cytarabine. Future directions for this combination include a
comparison with standard, cytarabine-based remission
induction therapy in patients with sAML, and with other
drugs being explored in patients with higher-risk MDS
who have developed disease recurrence or are refractory to
hypomethylator therapy. Each of these drugs individually
is being explored in combination with azacitidine in
ongoing clinical trials; it would be equally reasonable to
explore the combination with a hypomethylating agent.
In conclusion, the combination of GO and ATO is
a viable alternative to other outpatient regimens for the
treatment of patients with higher-risk MDS and sAML.
Responses were similar in de novo and previously treated
patients, and a natural next step would be to develop this
regimen in patients who have failed or progressed through
hypomethylation or other disease-modifying therapy.
