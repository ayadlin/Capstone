Abstract
We investigated the relationship between the resistance to the
proapoptotic action of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and cellular prion protein (PrPc)
function, using the TRAIL-sensitive MCF-7 human breast
adenocarcinoma cell line and two TRAIL-resistant sublines:
2101 and MCF-7/ADR. All of the cell lines tested expressed
TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. TRAIL decoy receptors were not
detected, suggesting that the resistance of 2101 and MCF-7/
ADR cells, strongly expressing PrPc, to TRAIL-mediated cell
death was independent from the expression of TRAIL
receptors and death-inducing signaling complex formation.
Down-regulation of PrPc by small interfering RNA increased
the sensitivity of Adriamycin- and TRAIL-resistant cells to
TRAIL, but not to epirubicin/Adriamycin. TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in PrPc knocked-down cells was associated with
caspase processing, Bid cleavage, and Mcl-1 degradation. In
addition, an increased sensitivity of apoptosis-resistant cells
to TRAIL after PrPc silencing was not associated with the
increased recruitment of receptors and intracellular signaling
molecule to the death-inducing signaling complex. Bcl-2
expression was substantially decreased after PrPc knock-down
but the levels of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were not affected. The downregulation of Bcl-2 was concomitant with Bax delocalization.
Our findings support the notion that silencing of PrPc
facilitates the activation of proapoptotic Bax by downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, thereby abolishing the resistance of breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Introduction
Despite promising early results, the treatment of breast cancer
with modulators has remained problematic. This may be because
there is an array of alternate resistance mechanisms, controlled by
different families of genes, including those involved in apoptosis.
These alternative pathways may influence drug resistance, leading
to diminished cell killing by chemotherapeutic drugs. The effector
molecules are poorly understood, and their relative contributions
in any one disease remain to be elucidated. Generally, there is a
need to develop new anticancer drugs and novel regimens that are
capable of killing drug-resistant cells. Chemoresistance has been

attributed to a failure of the drug to interact with its target, either
due to a reduction of the effective concentration of the drug
because of enhanced drug efflux pumps (1), or to detoxification
enzymes or to changes to the drug’s target(s) themselves (2).
Classic multidrug resistance is attributed to the elevated expression of ATP-dependent drug-efflux pumps ABCB1 (also known as
P-glycoprotein), ABCC1 (also known as multidrug resistance–
associated protein) and ABCG2 (also known as breast cancer–
resistance protein and mitoxantrone-resistance protein), all of
which belong to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters ( for review, see ref. 3). P-glycoprotein protects cells from
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and also from other death
stimuli including death receptor ligands and UV radiation.
Activation of death receptor pathways is a possible approach to
breast cancer treatment because of the ability of death receptors to
induce apoptosis directly, thus bypassing cellular drug resistance.
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL; also called Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) ligand family. It rapidly induces apoptosis in a variety
of transformed cell lines. TRAIL interacts with five receptors, i.e.,
TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, and osteoprotegerin.
Ligation of TRAIL to TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 induces apoptosis as
these receptors contain functional death domains, whereas TRAIL
interaction with the other three receptors does not induce
apoptosis. The interaction between TRAIL and the death receptors
(TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) leads to the recruitment of Fasassociated death domain kinase (FADD) and activates caspase8 to promote cell death without the involvement of mitochondria.
Caspase-10 is recruited to and activated at the TRAIL and CD95
death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC) in a FADD-dependent
manner but cannot functionally substitute caspase-8 (4). TRAIL
can also activate the cleavage of Bid by caspase-8, and this drives
cells to apoptosis through a mitochondrial amplification loop ( for
review, see refs. 5, 6).
There have been reports that TRAIL induces apoptotic activity in
some normal human cells (7–9). However, TRAIL suppresses the
growth of TRAIL-sensitive human mammary adenocarcinoma in
mice and non–human primates without any significant toxic
effects; in particular, TRAIL has none of the effects seen with
TNF-a and FasL (10, 11), indicating that the apoptotic effect of
TRAIL on nontransformed human cells depends on the TRAIL
preparations used. Although TRAIL can induce apoptosis in tumor
cells of diverse origins (12–14), several studies have shown that
most breast cancer cell lines are resistant to its apoptotic effects
(15, 16), suggesting that TRAIL alone might be ineffective for breast
cancer therapy. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that
TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo can be
sensitized by chemotherapeutic drugs, indicating that combination
therapy might be possible (15, 17, 18). Therefore, understanding the

molecular mechanisms of TRAIL resistance and identifying ways to
sensitize these cells to undergo apoptosis upon TRAIL treatment
may help the search for effective cancer therapy.
The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, expressed by all known mammals, predominantly in the brain. Several intriguing lines of evidence have
recently emerged indicating that PrPc may protect human neurons
from various kinds of internal or environmental stress ( for reviews,
see ref. 19). PrPc may participate in apoptosis: it shares significant
similarity with the Bcl-2 homology domain 2 and binds Bcl-2 in
yeast double-hybrid tests (20, 21). Indeed, PrPc can protect human
neurons from serum withdrawal (22) and Bax-induced apoptosis
(23–25). Stress-induced protein 1 is a cell surface ligand for PrPc
that transduces neuroprotective signals (26). PrPc protects a
human breast carcinoma cell line from TNF-induced cell death:
ectopic expression of human PrPc converted TNF-sensitive MCF-7
cells into TNF-resistant cells by a mechanism involving the
alteration of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and nuclear
condensation (27). Du et al. recently reported a study with
Adriamycin-sensitive gastric carcinoma cell lines indicating that
PrPc is also involved in multidrug resistance of tumors (28).
We investigated whether PrPc overexpression in breast carcinoma cells is associated with resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
We used TRAIL-resistant breast carcinoma cell lines and small
interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to attenuate PrPc expression.
Our findings suggest that selective PrPc down-regulation sensitizes
human Adriamycin-resistant cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
independently of DISC formation, and also shows that Bcl-2
expression was abolished following PrPc knock-down.

Antibody against FADD (mAb) was from BD Biosciences PharMingen. FLIP
antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and antibody
against caspase-8 (mAb) was obtained from Immunotech (France).
Cell lines. TNF-resistant 2101 cells were established from TNF-resistant
RA-1 cells transfected by p55 TNF receptor cDNA. Parental RA-1 cells were
derived from TNF-sensitive human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells after
continuous exposure to increasing doses of recombinant TNF as previously
described (30). Adriamycin-resistant MCF-7 cells with a multidrug-resistant
phenotype were established as described in ref. (31). All the cells were
maintained and propagated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS.
Determination of cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Viability was assessed by the
conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT; Sigma) to a formazan product. After appropriate incubation of cells
with TRAIL or Adriamycin, MTT (0.25 mg/mL) was added and the samples
incubated for 4 h at 37jC. Then, 100 AL of Me2SO was added to each well,
and the plates were read at 620 nm on a micro-ELISA plate reader. Cell
viability (%) = 100  (A 1/A 0), where A 1 and A 0 were the absorbances of
treated and untreated cells, respectively.

Cell death analysis. Cells were plated in a six-well plate at a density of
5  104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was then replaced
with either fresh medium (control medium) or with medium supplemented
with various concentrations of TRAIL or Adriamycin. Apoptotic events were
evaluated by Annexin V labeling, using the Annexin V-FITC/propidium
iodide assay kit (BD Biosciences) according to the standard protocol.
Flow cytometry analysis. Cells were plated on a six-well plate at a
density of 5  104 cells/well and cultured overnight. Immunofluorescence
analyses were carried out as previously described (27).
Purification of RNA and TaqMan (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems) real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from tumor cell lines using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen
S.A.), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (1 Ag) with a
28S/18S ratio >1.8 was used for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis
as previously described (27).
Western blot. The method was as described elsewhere (32). Briefly, cells
were lysed in an appropriate buffer containing 20 mmol/L of Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 1% CHAPS, 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L of
Na3VO4, and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Protease
Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were placed on
ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000  g for 30 min at 4jC. The
supernatants were collected. Equivalent (30 Ag) protein extract samples
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
probed with appropriate primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000.
Peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated with the
membrane at a dilution of 1:2,000. The membrane was then washed and
the signal visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western blotting kit;
Pierce). NIH Image software was used for densitometry analysis, including
correction for background.
DISC analysis. MCF-7/ADR and 2101 cells transfected by siRNA were
resuspended in 1 mL complete RPMI medium (7  106 cells/mL) at 37jC,
then stimulated for the indicated times with 500 ng/mL of Flag-TRAIL
(ALX-522-003-C010 from Alexis Biochemicals) and 2 Ag/mL of anti-Flag
(M2) antibody ( from Sigma) in a final volume of 1 mL. In some experiments,
M2 antibody was added without TRAIL after lysis of unstimulated controls
to determine nonspecific binding to protein G beads. The reaction was
stopped by adding 1 mL of ice-cold PBS. The cells were immediately
collected (400 g, 5 min, 4jC), washed with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and lysed in
500 AL of lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.2% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol and complete protease inhibitor cocktail;
Roche Biochemicals] for 30 min on ice. The lysate was cleared twice by
centrifugation at 16 000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The soluble fraction was
precleared with 20 AL of Sepharose-6B (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4jC and
immunoprecipitated with 20 AL of protein-G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham)
at 4jC. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed four times with
500 AL of lysis buffer. Sample buffer was added, beads were boiled for 5 min
and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
siRNA transfection. The siRNAs used were designed with the Eurogentec RNA interference designer tool. The two sequences used were (siRNA
PrPc 465) 5¶ GCA GGC CCA UCA UAC AUU UdTdT and (siRNA PrPc 545)
CAU GGA UGA GUA CAG CAA CCdT dT; scramble control siRNA CGC AGG
AUA CGC AAC ACA C dTdT purchased from Eurogentec (Belgium) was also
used. OligofectAMINE reagent was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen) to transfect subconfluent cells with siRNA PrPc.
Confocal scanning immunofluorescence microscopy. After appropriate transfection and treatment with various apoptotic stimuli, cells were
plated at 5  104 cells/well, washed with PBS and fixed by incubation with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 60 min. They were then incubated for
5 min with methanol (only used for Bax detection) and rinsed thrice with
PBS. SDS (0.1% in PBS) was used for 10 min to permeabilize the cells. The
cells were washed thrice with PBS and nonspecific binding sites were
blocked by incubation with 10% FCS in PBS for 20 min. Cells were then
incubated for 60 min with antibodies against Bax, Bcl-2, or PrPc and washed
thrice with PBS. They were then incubated with Alexa 488–conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and Alexa 546–conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody (Molecular Probes), and washed thrice with PBS. The nuclei were
stained by incubation with To-Pro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) for 5 min.

Results
Resistance of 2101 and MCF-7/ADR to TRAIL and Adriamycin.
We studied the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells and derivatives (2101 and
MCF-7/ADR) to Adriamycin and TRAIL-mediated cell death: the cell
lines 2101 and MCF-7/ADR were resistant to the cytotoxic action of
various concentrations of TRAIL which were present for various
times (Fig. 1A). MCF-7/ADR remained resistant to Adriamycin,
whereas 2101 exhibited a slight sensitivity to this drug. In contrast,
MCF-7 cells exhibited a substantial dose- and time-dependent
sensitivity to these agents. Findings with epirubicin were similar
(data not shown). Decreased MTTactivity might reflect growth arrest
or cell death, so we measured cell death directly. Following TRAIL
or Adriamycin treatment, 80% and 60%, respectively, of MCF-7 cells
became apoptotic (Fig. 1B), whereas only f3% of MCF-7/ADR cells
and 20% of 2101 cells became apoptotic after TRAIL treatment.
Resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was not due to a
lack of expression of TRAIL receptors. Next, we sought to
ascertain whether the resistance of the multidrug-resistant MCF-7/
ADR and 2101 cell lines to TRAIL-mediated cell death was due to
their not expressing TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, respectively, or to
enhanced expression of the TRAIL decoy receptors (TRAIL-R3 and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

TRAIL-R4). Immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2) indicated that all
of the cell lines expressed TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. The TRAIL
decoy receptors were not detected. These data suggest that the
resistance of 2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells to TRAIL-mediated cell
death was independent of the expression of TRAIL receptors.
Resistance of 2101 and MCF-7/ADR to Adriamycin correlates with high expression of PrPc. Ectopic expression of human
PrPc protects mammary tumor cells from cell death induced by
TNF (27). Du et al. recently reported a study with Adriamycinsensitive gastric carcinoma cell lines indicating that PrPc is also
involved in multidrug resistance of tumors (28). We investigated
the relationship between PrPc expression and resistance to TRAIL
or Adriamycin. We first checked the expression levels of PrPc in
2101 and MCF-7/ADR cell lines. Real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 3A)
and immunofluorescence analysis by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS; Fig. 3B) and by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C)
indicated that both of the cell lines contained more PrPc than the
parental MCF-7 cell line, and that the protein was present in the
Golgi apparatus and at the cell surface. Thus, overexpression of
PrPc seems to coincide with the resistance of breast carcinoma cell
lines to Adriamycin and TRAIL-induced cell death.
Knock-down of PrPc is sufficient to sensitize resistant
human breast carcinoma cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We used two siRNA duplexes (siRNA PrPc 465 and siRNA PrPc
545) complementary to both transcript variants of PRNP to
determine the effect of silencing of PrPc in both 2101 and MCF-7/

ADR cells. One of these siRNA duplexes (siRNA PrPc 465)
corresponds to the unstructured domain, and the other to the
structured domain. We did transient siRNA transfections of the 2101
and MCF-7/ADR cell lines using these two kinds of PRNP siRNA
duplexes, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis to evaluate
mRNA down-regulation. PrPc mRNA levels were significantly lower
in cells transfected with these siRNA molecules than in cells
transfected with the scramble control siRNA (Fig. 4A). Immunofluorescence analysis by FACS (Fig. 4B, top) and by confocal
microscopy (Fig. 4B, bottom) also indicated that PrPc levels were
significantly lower in cells transfected with these siRNA molecules
than in cells transfected with the scramble control siRNA.
Transfection with these siRNA molecules for 72 h without any
treatment did not significantly increase cell sensitivity to cell death.
We then analyzed the sensitivity of siRNA-transfected cells to
Adriamycin and to TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity by MTT assay
(Fig. 4C). PrPc knock-down partly restored the sensitivity of
MCF-7/ADR and 2101 cells to the cytotoxic action of TRAIL, but it
failed to significantly increase the sensitivity of cells to Adriamycin.
The PRNP siRNA did not significantly increase the apoptosis of
either cell line in response to Adriamycin/epirubicin. In contrast,
the PrPc down-regulation enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
resulting in the apoptosis of 25% of MCF-7/ADR cells (Fig. 4D,
right) and almost 60% of 2101 cells (Fig. 4D, left). Western blot
analysis indicated that TRAIL treatment did not affect the amount
of PrPc in siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). These various
findings strongly suggest that PrPc knockdown by siRNA is

sufficient to sensitize MCF-7/ADR and 2101 cell lines to TRAILinduced apoptosis. In accordance with the presumed function of
PrPc as an inhibitor of death receptor–induced Bid cleavage and
caspase-3 activation, Western blot analyses indicated that downregulation of PrPc by siRNAs enhanced TRAIL-induced Bid
cleavage and caspase-3 processing. Bid cleavage and caspase-3
processing were not enhanced following Adriamycin treatment,
confirming that the down-regulation of PrPc by siRNAs did not
increase the sensitivity of the cells to Adriamycin-induced cell
death (Fig. 5A).
Knock-down of PrPc down-regulates Bcl-2 expression. We
investigated whether the enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis associated with PrPc down-regulation involved the modulation
of Bcl-2 family members. Western blot analyses indicated that in
both cell lines, Bcl-2 was less abundant in the PRNP siRNA
545–transfected than control-transfected cells; other members of
the Bcl-2 family, including Bax, Bcl XL, and Mcl-1 were largely
unaffected. TRAIL treatment decreased the abundance of Bcl-2
and Mcl-1, but not Bcl-XL in the PRNP siRNA 545–transfected cells
(Fig. 5A). Similar findings were obtained with PRNP siRNA 465–
transfected cells. Thus, inhibiting PrPc expression resulted in the
down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression.
Western blot analyses in both cell lines indicated that in the
presence of PrPc following TRAIL treatment, Bid is not cleaved and
Mcl-1 is not down-regulated. In the absence of PrPc, Bid cleavage
and down-regulation of Mcl-1 were observed after 5 h of TRAIL
treatment, and peaked after 10 h of treatment (Fig. 5A).

Figure 2. TRAIL receptor expression at the surface of MCF-7 and derivative cells (2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells). TRAIL receptors on cells were determined by
indirect immunofluorescence analysis by FACS, using anti–TRAIL-R1 (M271 clone), anti–TRAIL-R2 (M413 clone), anti–TRAIL-R3 (M430 clone), and anti–TRAIL-R4
(M445 clone; gray histogram ). Isotypic IgG1 (negative controls) were included (open histogram ). The level of cell surface expression is indicated by the shift of the
gray histogram to the right from the open control curve. Numbers, percentages of positive cells; numbers in parentheses, mean fluorescence intensities. Results
are representative of three independent experiments.

Figure 3. PrPc expression in MCF-7 cells and its derivative cells (2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells). A, the expression of the PRNP gene in cell lines was assayed
by quantitative RT-PCR. Columns, means of three independent determinations; bars, SD (***, P < 0.0001). Experimental values were normalized to those for the 18S
gene. B, PrPc proteins on the cell surface of MCF-7, 2101, and MCF-7/ADR cells were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using mouse Pri 308
anti-human PrPc mAb (gray histogram ) as described in Fig. 2. C, PrPc expression in tumor cells (MCF-7, 2101, and MCF-7/ADR) was determined by confocal
microscopy. Immunostaining was done with anti-PrPc mAb (green ), and anti-Golgi (red). The confocal scanning fluorescence micrographs are representative of the
majority of tumor cells analyzed.

Next, we tested whether silencing PrPc by siRNAs, which
resulted in the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein, also affects Bcl2 mRNA. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that in
the absence of PrPc, Bcl-2 mRNA was slightly down-regulated in
both cell lines (Fig. 5C). These observations are consistent with the
absence of PrPc down-regulating Bcl-2 at both mRNA and protein
levels. However, the down-regulation at the protein level is more
pronounced than that at the mRNA level.
A characteristic feature of Bcl-2 proteins is that they form
heterodimers with Bax or other proapoptotic molecules, and this
may block their proapoptotic activity. PrPc prevents Baxmediated cell death by preventing the Bax proapoptotic
conformational change in human neurons and in MCF-7 cells
(24). PrPc partially inhibits Bax translocation to the mitochondria in MCF-7 cells. The requirement for Bax in TRAIL-induced
apoptosis of type II cells has been mapped to the mitochondrial
amplification cycle (33, 34). We therefore tested whether
silencing PrPc by siRNAs, which resulted in the down-regulation
of Bcl-2, also affects the localization of Bax. Immunofluorescence
staining of untreated 2101 cells (Fig. 5D, top) and untreated
MCF-7/ADR cells (Fig. 5D, bottom) showed a diffuse cytosolic
localization for Bax. As expected, after silencing of PrPc, Bax
immunoreactivity became punctuate, but there was no evidence
of significant nuclear condensation. After incubation with TRAIL
for 4 h, more of the PrPc siRNA–transfected cells (+ siRNAs +
TRAIL; Fig. 5D) than untransfected cells (+ TRAIL, Fig. 5D)
became apoptotic. To check that the silencing of PrPc by siRNAs
results in the observed Bcl-2 down-regulation, Bcl-2 staining
was also examined and the findings confirmed those obtained by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

Western blotting. Bcl-2 down-regulation was concomitant with
the change affecting the localization of Bax. These various
findings suggest that inhibiting PrPc expression may facilitate
the cleavage of Bid, which is concomitant with Mcl-1 downregulation, and also activate the proapoptotic Bax by downregulation of Bcl-2 expression levels.
Knock-down of PrPc does not affect TRAIL DISC formation.
We sought to ascertain whether the knockdown of PrPc expression
by RNA interference modulates the expression of TRAIL receptors
on the cell surface. Immunofluorescence analysis suggests that
knockdown of PrPc does not affect the expression of TRAIL
receptors (data not shown). However, this observation did not rule
out the possibility that knockdown of PrPc expression by RNA
interference could facilitate the formation of the DISC in response
to TRAIL exposure. To test this possibility, we did immunoprecipitation experiments in MCF-7/ADR and 2101 cells in which PrPc
was down-regulated by siRNA for 72 h. Then, cells were incubated
for 30 min or 1 h at 37jC with Flag-TRAIL crosslinked to an antiFlag antibody. In the presence or absence of PrPc, the same
amount of recruitment of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, FADD,
procaspase-8, and FLIP-L to the DISC was observed (Fig. 6). PrPc
down-regulation therefore does not affect this DISC formation, and
the increased sensitivity of Adriamycin- and TRAIL-resistant cells
to TRAIL after PrPc silencing, is not associated with increased
recruitment of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, FADD, procaspase-8, or
FLIP-L to the DISC. In addition, TRADD is not recruited in the
presence or absence of PrPc. Thus, TRAIL DISC formation is not
involved in the resistance of MCF-7/ADR and 2101 to TRAILinduced apoptosis.

Discussion
The principal findings of this article concern the molecular
mechanisms by which breast carcinoma cells are resistant to
apoptosis. We compared breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells and two
derivative clones (2101 and MCF-7/ADR) and found that MCF-7
cells are more sensitive than both 2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells to
anthracycline-based treatment and death domain receptor–
mediated apoptosis. The resistance of 2101 cells and multidrug-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

resistant MCF-7/ADR cells to apoptosis was independent of TRAIL
receptor expression. Our experimental system might therefore be
an appropriate in vitro model for investigating whether PrPc
mediates apoptosis resistance in breast carcinoma cells. We have
previously shown that PrPc protects a human breast carcinoma cell
line from TNF-induced cell death (27). However, the question of
whether down-regulation of PrPc sensitizes the resistant breast
carcinoma cell line to apoptosis remained to be answered. Here, we

Silencing of PrPc Sensitizes Human Breast Carcinoma to Apoptosis

report that resistance to Adriamycin- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was strongly correlated with PrPc overexpression, as revealed by
assaying both PrPc mRNA and protein.
This is the first demonstration that down-regulation of PrPc
sensitizes Adriamycin-resistant human breast carcinoma cell lines
to TRAIL-mediated cell death. In addition, the increased sensitivity
of Adriamycin- and TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL after PrPc
silencing was not associated with increased recruitment of
receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to the DISC. These
data are consistent with previous reports. Indeed, PrPc protects
human neurons and MCF-7 cells against Bax-mediated apoptosis
by affecting the Bax conformation (24). In yeast, this effect seems to
be related to the interactions between PrPc and endogenous yeast
proteins that act downstream from Bax in a cellular stress or
toxicity pathway (25). Down-regulation of PrPc by siRNA correlated
with a change in Bax localization and a large decrease in the
amount of Bcl-2 such that the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased. The ratio
between Bax or Bak and Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL is believed to be important
in determining sensitivity to cell death. A characteristic feature of
Bcl-2 proteins is the formation of homodimers and heterodimers
with other members of the family. For example, Bcl-2 could form
heterodimers with Bax, or other proapoptotic molecules, and may
thus block their proapoptotic activity. Our data is the first to
suggest that down-regulation of PrPc sensitizes human Adriamycin-resistant breast carcinoma cell lines to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis through Bcl-2 down-regulation. This observation is in
agreement with other reports indicating that the transfection of
MCF-7 with the Bcl-2 gene did not reduce TNF sensitivity (35).
Bcl-2 was overexpressed in the TNF-sensitive MCF-7 cell line, but
was down-regulated in the TNF-resistant MCF-7 cell line (36). The
observed decline in Bcl-2 levels following PrPc silencing is also

consistent with previous findings indicating that PrPc acts through
Bcl-2. Indeed, PrPc interacts with Bcl-2 in the yeast two-hybrid
system (21). Like Bcl-2, PrPc prevents Bax conformational change
(24, 37) and Bax-mediated cell death (23). Both PrPc and Bcl-2
expression protect against cell death associated with serum
deprivation (22) and oxidative stress (38). The signals activating
Bax are not well known, but one current model is that death
receptor–mediated activation of caspase-8 triggers Bid processing
(39, 40). Truncated Bid (tBid) then signals translocation of cytosolic
Bax to the mitochondria, where it forms homodimers or
heterodimers with other Bcl-2 family members. The resultant
conformational changes in Bax can result in channel formation
allowing the release of apoptogenic proteins, including cytochrome
c, from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, thereby activating
downstream execution (40–42). Bid cleavage observed in breast
carcinoma cell sensitization to TRAIL by PrPc silencing (Fig. 5)
implicates Bax insertion into the mitochondrial membrane
triggered by tBid (43). Consistent with these results, and with data
suggesting that TRAIL induces Mcl-1 degradation (44), we observed
that inhibition of PrPc expression did not affect Mcl-1 expression,
but that TRAIL induced a substantial decrease of Mcl-1
degradation which is concomitant with the cleavage of Bid. This
does not occur, however, when cells are treated with Adriamycin.
This may be because tBid interferes only weakly with the
antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2, whereas it may be able to
neutralize the antiapoptotic function of Mcl-1 (45). This does not
seem to be the case for Adriamycin, which seems to induce a BH3only family member which apparently cannot overcome the
apoptosis-inhibitory effect exerted by Mcl-1 in spite of the Bcl-2
down-regulation. However, several different mechanisms for the
development of Adriamycin resistance have been described,

(500 ng/mL with 2 Ag/mL of anti-Flag antibody). DISCs were immunoprecipitated with protein G and analyzed for the proteins indicated by immunoblotting, with
the exception that TRAIL was not added to lysates of control cells. Lysates prepared from 2101 and MCF-7/ADR cells (Lys. ) are shown as positive controls for the

including reduced drug uptake and increased drug efflux (1).
Recent studies have shown that breast neoplasms can be classified
into two very distinct entities according to the expression profile of
the gene for the estrogen receptor a (ER; ref. 46). Troester et al.
reported that the proteins involved in the response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy may differ according to cell lineage and
ER-status (47). Here, we show that down-regulation of PrPc by
siRNA was insufficient to sensitize ER-positive 2101 and ERpositive MCF-7/ADR to Adriamycin-mediated apoptosis. This is
consistent with our recent data suggesting that the absence of PrPc
expression is associated with high sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy only in ER-negative tumors (48).
Our observations are not consistent with the data reported by
Du et al. showing the partial induction of cell apoptosis by PrPc
knock-down expression in the Adriamycin-resistant gastric carcinoma SGC7901/ADR cell line (28). This discrepancy could be due to
the different in vitro models used. Note also that our observation is
consistent with data suggesting that PrPc cannot prevent
staurosporine- or thapsigargin-meditated cell death, both of which
are mediated through tBid/Bak (19).
Although our data suggest that knock-down of PrPc expression
increased the sensitivity of Adriamycin-resistant human breast
carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by down-regulation of
Bcl-2 and altering Bax localization, our study presented several
limitations. Our experiments are uninformative about how PrPc
down-regulation induces the down-regulation of Bcl-2. We intend
to study this issue subsequently. However, real-time PCR analysis
indicated that this down-regulation involves both mRNA and
protein levels. The difference at the protein level is more
pronounced than that at the mRNA level. Various Bcl-2 antibodies
all gave the same pattern in Western blot analyses (data not shown)
ruling out the possibility that Bcl-2 down-regulation was due to the
cleavage of Bcl2.

In conclusion, it has been established that Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
antagonize cell death by sequestering members of the proapoptotic
family including the BH3-only family and multidomain proapoptotics. We report that in the presence of PrPc and under TRAILapoptotic conditions, small amounts of tBid were produced. tBid
has a much higher affinity for Mcl-1 than Bcl-2, and consequently,
tBid interferes only weakly with the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2
(45). Mcl-1, which has high affinity with tBid, interacts with and
blocks tBid-mediated cell death. In the absence of PrPc and under
TRAIL-apoptotic conditions, Bcl-2 expression was abolished. We
propose that as a result, more tBid was available to interact with
Mcl-1 and thus neutralized the antiapoptotic function of Mcl-1
more strongly. In addition, degradation of Mcl-1 by TRAIL-activated
caspase-3 may produce proapoptotic forms of Mcl-1 that mediates a
Bax-dependent apoptotic cascade. In addition, the apoptotic signal
leads to caspase-3 activation, which activates caspase-8 that further
increases tBid formation, independently of DISC formation. This
accelerates the cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways via an amplification loop, thereby abolishing the
resistance of breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
