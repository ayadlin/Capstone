BACKGROUND: ERBB receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and
survival in many types of cells and play critical roles in many malignancies. Recent reports suggest a role for
EGFR signaling in proliferation and survival of neuroblastoma, a common form of pediatric cancer that often has
an extremely poor outcome. METHODS: The authors examined ERBB family expression in neuroblastoma cell lines
and patient samples by flow cytometry, western blot, and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction
(Q-PCR). Response to ERBB inhibition was assessed in vitro by cell-cycle analysis and western blot and in vivo
by serial tumor-size measurements. RESULTS: A panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and primary patient tumors
expressed EGFR, HER-3, and HER-4, with HER-2 in some tumors. HER-4 mRNA was expressed predominantly in
cleavable isoforms. Whereas EGFR inhibition with erlotinib and pan-ERBB inhibition with CI-1033 inhibited EGFinduced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2, only CI-1033 induced growth inhibition and dose-dependent
apoptosis in vitro. Both CI-1033 and erlotinib treatment of neuroblastoma xenograft tumors resulted in decreased
tumor growth in vivo, although CI-1033 was more effective. In vivo expression of EGFR was observed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Pan-ERBB inhibition is required for ERBB-related neuroblastoma apoptosis in vitro, although EGFR contributes indirectly to tumor growth in vivo. Inhibition of EGFR in
endothelial cells may be an important aspect of erlotinib’s impact on neuroblastoma growth in vivo. Our results
suggest that non-EGFR ERBB family members contribute directly to neuroblastoma growth and survival, and panERBB inhibition represents a potential therapeutic target for treating neuroblastoma. Cancer 2010;116:3233–43.

Neuroblastoma is a severe cancer of childhood, causing >7% of malignancies in children younger than 15 years
of age and approximately 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths. Outcome for children with high-risk neuroblastoma remains
<40% with current treatment regimens.1 The poor survival rates of high-risk patients warrants investigation into novel
treatment options.
Dependence on growth factors is one of the hallmarks of cancer.2 The ERBB family, comprised of EGFR, HER-2,
HER-3, and HER-4, is a group of receptor tyrosine kinases with common and unique signaling properties3 that can provide these essential signals. Constitutive activation of EGFR and HER-2 through autocrine ligand production, receptor
overexpression, or activating mutation occurs commonly in carcinomas and is correlated with poor prognosis. Less is
known about HER-3 and HER-4 in cancer, and few reports correlate HER-3 and HER-4 expression or activation with
prognosis.4
The role of the ERBB family has not been well established in neuroblastoma. EGFR expression and effectiveness of
anti-EGFR treatment in vitro has been reported,5,6 although others found no response to erlotinib in vivo.7 Surprisingly,
exposure to EGF induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.8-10 None of these reports evaluated contributions of
other ERBB family members nor tested their importance in vivo.

Original Article

We report that pan-ERBB inhibition is more effective than EGFR-specific inhibition in neuroblastoma. A
pan-ERBB inhibitor caused significant growth inhibition
in vitro and in vivo, whereas EGFR-specific inhibition
was ineffective in vitro and produced a modest reduction
in tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that HER4 signaling may be important in neuroblastoma and that a
pan-ERBB inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic approach
for children with neuroblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
CI-1033 (Pfizer, NY, NY) was dissolved in water, 5 mM
for in vitro use and at 4.5 mg/mL for in vivo use. Erlotinib
(OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY) was dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 mM for in vitro use and
7.5 mg/mL for in vivo use.

Flow Cytometry
Adherent neuroblastoma cells were washed with PBS and
mobilized with enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and washed with cold PBS/1 % bovine serum
albumin (Fisher, Pittsburgh, Pa). Antibodies to EGFR
and HER-2 directly conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE)
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), HER-3 and
HER-4 (Neomarkers, Fremont, Calif) antibodies, or the
appropriate IgG isotype control (Becton Dickinson) were
then incubated with the cells on ice for 30 minutes. The
cells were then washed with PBS/1% BSA 3 times. For
the HER-3 and HER-4, a secondary PE-conjugated
anti-mouse (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) was
incubated with the cells for 30 minutes on ice. ERBB
expression was then analyzed by flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson).
HER-4 Isoform Analysis
Sample Preparation

Cell lines
Neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, SH-EP,
SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, SMS-KCNR, LA1-55N, NGP,
and CHP-134 were obtained from Dr. Susan Cohn
(The University of Chicago Children’s Hospital,
Chicago, Ill) and Dr. John Maris (Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa) and have been previously described.11-18 Cells were incubated at 37 C and
5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Manassas, Va)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah),
1% L-glutamine (Lonza, Allendale, NJ), and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gemini, Woodland, Calif). A431
and SKOV-3 cells19,20 were used as positive controls
and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif)
with all other conditions the same. The breast cancer
cell line T47D was obtained from Dr. Seth Corey
(The Children’s Cancer Hospital at M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, Tex) and was grown in
DMEM/F12 (Mediatech), with all other conditions as
above. For all experiments, cells were harvested when
confluence was less than 80%.
Patient-Derived Tumor Samples
For primary tumors, approval for specimens was obtained
from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma committee. Frozen primary tumor samples were
then received from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) funded by the National Cancer Institute.
Other investigators may have received specimens from the
same subjects.

RNA was extracted from neuroblastoma cells grown
to 70% confluency with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
and treated with DNase I (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed
using the Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Qiagen)
with oligo-dTs (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Primer Design

Primers were designed to anneal uniquely to the 4
HER-4 JM a-d isoforms according to previously reported
sequences.21 Forward primers: HER4 JM-a (50 -CTGCA
CCCAAGGGTGTAACG-30 ), HER4 JM-b (50 -GGCC
TGATGGATAGAACTCC-30 ), HER4 JM-c (50 -CAAA
CTGCACCCAAGGAACTC-30 ), and HER4 JM-d
(50 -CGGCCTGATGGATAGGTGTAAC-30 ). A common reverse primer was used for all 4 HER4 JM isoforms
(50 -GCAAATGTCAGACCCACAATG-30 ).
The HER4 JM isoform data was normalized by
comparing the number of isoform copies to the number
of GAPDH copies with the forward primer (50 -GCAT
CCTGGGCTACACTGAG-30 ) and the reverse primer
(50 -CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-30 ).
Q-PCR

Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction
(Q-PCR) was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Biorad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Thermal cycling of HER4 JM a-d consisted of 38 cycles
of: 95 C for 30 seconds; 61, 63, 64, or 64 C for

30 seconds, respectively; and 72 C for 25, 15, 15, or 20
seconds, respectively. Expected amplification products for
HER4 JM a-d were: 155, 82, 84, and 158 bp, respectively.
Thermal cycling of GAPDH consisted of 38 cycles of:
95 C for 30 seconds, 60 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for
15 seconds with an expected product of 161 bp.
The mRNA transcript copy number was quantified
absolutely by creating standard curves of the target message. HER4 JM isoforms standard curves were created by
amplifying pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing HER4 JM
isoform cDNA; GAPDH standard curve was created by
amplifying pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) containing a 161 bp
fragment of GAPDH. Products were evaluated for specificity by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gels.

Western Blotting
For analysis of target inhibition, cells were treated with
CI-1033 or erlotinib for 24 hours, followed by 5 minutes
of exposure to EGF (100 ng/mL), then washed in cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated on ice
with protein lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 10 mM
NaF, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100)
containing phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Mo) and protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 10 minutes. Lysate was then scraped from the
plate and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at
4 C. Supernatant was collected and protein concentration
determined with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). Frozen patient samples were homogenized using
a Dismembrator (Sartorius, Edgewood, NY) then lysed in
the same lysis buffer. Protein lysate in the amount of
30 lg was loaded into an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and then
transferred to nitrocellulose using standard methods.
Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (100 mM
Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.9) for 1 hour at
room temperature and then washed with TBS-Tween 3
times for 5 minutes. Membranes were then incubated
with primary antibody (EGFR, pEGFR, AKT, pAKT,
ERK1/2, pERK1/2, and PARP at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, Mass), HER-3 and HER-4 at 1:50 (Neomarkers), HER-2 at 1:1500 (Epitomics, Burlingame,
Calif), and actin at 1:1000 (Sigma)) overnight at 4 C.
Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes in
TBST, then incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibody/HRP for 1 hour at room temperature and then
washed 3 times for 10 minutes in TBST. Chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce) were incubated with the

membranes for 1 minute, followed by film development
on a Kodak developer.
Growth Analysis
Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well in a 6-well
plate. After cells became adherent, drug was added and
refreshed every 24 hours. After 3 or 7 days of triplicate
treatments with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 3, or 5 lM CI-1033 or 0,
0.1, 1, 3, 5, or 10 lM erlotinib, media and dead cells were
removed by washing with PBS. Intact nuclei were
extracted by addition of a 0.01M hepes-0.015 M MgCl2
buffer for 5 minutes, followed by addition of 5% Bretol
(ethyl hexadecyldimethylammonium bromide) in water
and agitation for 10 minutes. Nuclei were then fixed with
a 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% formalin solution in water and
counted using the ViCell Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif) as previously described.22
IC50 values were calculated using Microsoft Excel with a
best-fit trendline.
EGFR and K-Ras mutation analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from neuroblastoma cell lines
using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The somatic status of the EGFR gene was investigated by PCR using primers specific for exons 18-21,
encompassing the tyrosine kinase domain. For the K-RAS
gene, PCR was performed using exon 2 specific primers.
Subsequently, PCR fragments were sequenced and analyzed
by direct sequencing in both sense and antisense directions.
For the ease of sequencing, M13 tails were attached to every
primer pair. Primer sequences were as follows:

EGFR exon 18: forward primer: CCTGAGGTGACC
CTTGTCTCTGTGTTCTT,
reverse primer: GAGGCCTGTGCCAGGGACCTTA,
EGFR exon 19: forward primer: CGCACCATCTCA

Cell-cycle analysis
Untreated and cells treated with CI-1033 or erlotinib for
48 hours were evaluated for changes in cell cycle by propidium iodide staining. Adherent and nonadherent cells
were harvested using trypsin (Gibco), washed with PBS,
and resuspended in a 0.005% propidium iodide and
0.1% Triton solution in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight and evaluated on the FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
In vivo xenografts and administration of
ERBB inhibitors
12-week-old NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma knockout mice
(Stock # 005557, The Jackson Laboratories) were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank with 5 million SK-NSH cells. Mice were randomized into control, CI-1033
treatment, and erlotinib-treatment groups at the time of
injection. Treatment began when tumors became palpable
(approximately 50 mm3). CI-1033 (30 mg/kg) and erlotinib (10 mg/kg) were given by gavage daily. The dose of
CI-1033, which is the murine maximally tolerated dose,
was chosen to give a serum level exceeding the in vitro
IC50 identified in our preliminary data for SH-N-SH.23
For erlotinib, we wished to use the minimally biologically
effective dose, as determined by inhibition of the EGFRdriven tumor HN5.24 Note that at a dose of 10 mg/kg,
the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation is identical
whether the drug is given intraperitoneally or orally.24
Tumor size was measured in triplicate every other day
with electric calipers, and the average measurement was
used for analysis. Tumor volume was determined with the
formula for the area of an ellipse, 4/3p  R1  R22. All
mice were sacrificed 18 days after first tumor appearance.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were euthanized, and tumors were excised and flash
frozen in OCT (Sakura, Torrance, Calif). Frozen tumors
were sectioned and fixed with ice-cold acetone. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed by standard
techniques. Slides were incubated in 4% fish gelatin in
PBS for 20 minutes, followed by addition of anti-CD31
antibody (Becton Dickinson) overnight at 4 C. Slides
were rinsed with PBS and incubated with Texas Redlabeled goat antirat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa) for 1 hour. Slides were then
washed in PBS and incubated with anti-EGFR antibody

3236

(Santa Cruz) at 4 C overnight. Alexa488-labeled antirabbit secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour. Slides
were then rinsed, counter-stained with Hoechst 33,342
(Invitrogen) for 2 minutes, and coverslips were placed
with antifade reagent (Invitrogen).

RESULTS
Expression of ERBB receptors in
neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumors
We evaluated the cell surface expression of EGFR, HER-3,
and HER-4 by flow cytometry in 9 human neuroblastoma
tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A). EGFR was variably expressed on
the cell surface in 6 of the cell lines, with highest expression
in the SK-N-AS and SH-EP cell lines. Interestingly, SK-NSH cells had bimodal expression, which may reflect their
dual population of N- type (SH-SY5Y) and S-type (SHEP)
cells. HER-2 was not detected (data not shown). Low
HER-3 expression was detected in several cell lines by flow
cytometry. HER-4 was the most consistently detected
ERBB receptor, with expression in 7 of the 9 cell lines.
Four cell lines (SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, IMR-32, and
CHP134) were further evaluated by Q-PCR to determine
the proportion of mRNA in each of the juxtamembranous
isoforms21 (Fig. 1B). Expression of HER-4 mRNA was
proportional to cell-surface expression, and cleavable isoforms of HER-4 (JMa and JMd) were expressed at much
higher levels than noncleavable isoforms (JMb and JMc).
Western blots were used to evaluate total ERBB
expression (Fig. 2A). EGFR was detected in all cell lines
by western blot analysis, with highest levels in the SK-NAS and SH-EP cell lines. The detection of EGFR by western blot in surface-negative lines suggests internalization
of activated protein in these samples.25 HER-3 was variably expressed in all cell lines, with highest levels in SK-NSH, SH-SY5Y, and LA1-55N cells. HER-4 was expressed
in all 9 neuroblastoma cell lines, with highest expression
in SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, and KCNR cells. Consistent with
the flow-cytometry results, HER-2 expression was below
the threshold of detection for western blot analysis (data
not shown).
Expression of the ERBB receptors in primary neuroblastoma tumor samples was determined by western blot.
All 4 receptors, EGFR, HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4,
were variably expressed in 20 patient samples (Fig. 2B).
EGFR and HER-4 were the predominant ERBB receptors
expressed, whereas HER-2 and HER-3 had variable
expression. These results suggest that the role of HER-4 in
neuroblastoma should be explored.

either directly conjugated to PE (EGFR) or then incubated with a secondary PE conjugated antibody (HER-3 and HER-4). Positive controls were A431 (EGFR) and T47D (HER-3 and HER-4). Filled histograms represent the isotype control and unfilled histograms represent ERBB-PE expression. (B) RNA from cell lines SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, IMR32 and CHP134 was reverse-transcribed
and assessed by Q-PCR for expression of each of the HER-4 juxtamembranous isoforms. Histograms represent copies of each of
the 4 isoforms (JMa, JMb, JMc, and JMd) per million copies of GAPDH. Triplicate samples were analyzed; error bars represent
standard deviation. Cleavable isoforms of HER-4 (JMa and JMd) were much more abundant than noncleavable isoforms (JMb
and JMc) for all lines tested.

Sensitivity of neuroblastoma to EGFR and
Pan-ERBB Inhibition
Given the expression of ERBB family members in neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples, we compared the
effects of the selective EGFR inhibitor erlotinib,24 with a
pan-ERBB inhibitor, CI-1033,26 on a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Cells were treated with inhibitors for 3
days, and proliferation and survival were assessed (Table
1). CI-1033 treatment caused a dramatic reduction in cell
yield for all lines, with IC50 values ranging from 0.94 lM
to 2.45 lM. (CI-1033 is specific for the ERBB family of
receptor tyrosine kinases in whole cells up to concentrations of 20 micromolar.27) Expression of EGFR tended to
correlate with CI-1033 sensitivity, in that the lines with
the highest EGFR expression by either flow cytometry
or western blot analysis had the lowest IC50 values with
CI-1033. The level of HER-4 expression did not appear
to correlate with CI-1033 responsiveness. In contrast,

Cancer

erlotinib induced minimal growth inhibition, achieving
an IC50 <10 lM in only 2 of the 9 cell lines (SK-N-AS
and LA1-55N). All neuroblastoma cell lines examined
were negative for mutations in all investigated EGFR
exons and K-RAS exon 2 (data not shown).
Differential induction of apoptosis
with CI-1033 and erlotinib
treatment in vitro
Cell-cycle effects of CI-1033 and erlotinib in SK-N-SH
cells were determined by propidium iodide staining (Fig.
3A). CI-1033 treatment at 3 lM for 48 hours increased
subdiploid SK-N-SH cells from 3% to 56% (P < .005).
In contrast, erlotinib only slightly increased the proportion of subdiploid cells, even at 10 lM (P < .05). Similarly, in SK-N-AS cells, significant apoptosis was induced
with CI-1033 at 5 lM (P < .005) but not with erlotinib
(data not shown).

Figure 2. Shown is the expression of ERBB in neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples. (A) Protein expression of EGFR,
HER-3, and HER-4 of 9 neuroblastoma cell lines was evaluated by western blot analysis. (B) Protein lysates from primary patient
tumors were evaluated for expression of EGFR, HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4. Actin was used as the loading control.

To confirm that CI-1033 treatment was inducing
apoptosis, we assessed for PARP cleavage by western blot.
A dose-dependent increase in PARP cleavage was evident
in SK-N-SH cells by 24 hours of CI-1033 treatment. In
contrast, erlotinib caused no PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B).
We obtained similar results with SK-N-AS (data not
shown).
Both CI-1033 and erlotinib inhibit EGFR and
downstream signaling
We wished to know whether the ERBB inhibitors were
effectively blocking signaling through EGFR in neuroblastoma. Both inhibitors decreased EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR at a concentration of 0.01 lM (Fig.
4). Near-complete inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation
occurred by 1 lM CI-1033, which correlated with a
decrease in ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, with no
changes in corresponding total protein levels (Fig. 4A).

3238

However, despite dramatic inhibition of EGFR and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 1lM erlotinib, the phosphorylation of AKT only modestly decreased, even at high
concentrations of erlotinib, suggesting a role for other
ERBB receptors in AKT activation (Fig. 4B).
In vivo tumor growth with CI-1033 and
erlotinib treatment
An established neuroblastoma xenograft model using SKN-SH cells in immunodeficient NOD-SCID-IL2R
gamma knockout mice was used to test the effects of
EGFR and pan-ERBB inhibition in vivo. Tumor-bearing
mice were treated by daily gavage with erlotinib, CI-1033,
or vehicle control. Treatment with CI-1033 for 18 days
resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth (P <
.0001). Surprisingly, erlotinib treatment also reduced tumor growth after 18 days of treatment, but to a lesser
degree than CI-1033 (P < .005) (Fig. 5A). Similarly,

treatment with CI-1033 reduced final tumor weight by an
average of 56% (P < .005), compared with a 34% reduction with erlotinib treatment (Fig. 5B).
To evaluate whether there was a role for ERBB signaling in neuroblastoma tumor angiogenesis, we measured CD31 staining in tumor sections. Mean vessel
density after treatment with CI-1033 or erlotinib treatment showed a trend toward decreased vascularity in the
erlotinib group (data not shown). Interestingly, antiCD31 staining colocalized with EGFR staining, whereas
EGFR staining was also seen in surrounding tumor tissue
(Fig. 5D). This suggests that EGFR inhibition on tumor
vasculature contributes to ERBB inhibitors’ in vivo effect,
as has been described in other tumor models,28-31 but further studies are required.

DISCUSSION
Children with high-risk neuroblastoma have a survival
rate of <40%, even with aggressive treatment.1 Neuroblastoma survivors often have serious long-term adverse
effects after treatment.32 Children with high-risk neuroblastoma, therefore, need novel therapies to improve overall outcomes and to reduce the incidence and severity of
late effects.
This study reports, for the first time, characterization of the ERBB family in neuroblastoma by flow
cytometry. We report cell-surface expression of EGFR,
HER-3, and HER-4 in a panel of cell lines. Interestingly,
comparison with western blot results suggests that much
of the expressed EGFR is not displayed at the cell surface, pointing toward regulation of EGFR signaling
through receptor recycling. Future studies of ERBB’s
role in neuroblastoma should include a more detailed
evaluation of the intracellular location of each family

member, to better define the roles that each molecule
plays and how small molecule inhibitors might affect
them. The ERBB expression we observe is similar to
prior reports of ERBB expression by RT-PCR.5 Primary
tumor samples also expressed abundant EGFR and
HER-4, with varied HER-2 and HER-3, suggesting that
signaling through more than 1 ERBB receptor, particularly HER-4, may play a role in neuroblastoma. It is not
clear why HER-2 was detected in some primary samples
but no established cell lines. It is possible that the conditioned used to establish neuroblastoma cell cultures
select against HER-2 expression or that a broader panel
of cell lines might identify samples with HER-2 expression. It is clear, however, that HER-2 expression is not
essential in neuroblastoma pathogenesis, to the extent
that many cell lines and at least some patient samples
had no HER-2 expression.

Supporting a role for ERBB signaling in neuroblastoma, we observed different effects from the pan-ERBB
inhibitor CI-103326,27 compared with selective EGFR

inhibition by erlotinib.33,34 Whereas both inhibitors
blocked EGF-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation at similar concentrations, CI-1033 was more effective

at inhibiting proliferation, inducing PARP-cleavage and
apoptosis and inhibiting AKT phosphorylation. This
effect correlated with more potent in vivo growth inhibition with CI-1033 than erlotinib. These results suggest
that ERBB receptors other than EGFR may contribute to
neuroblastoma growth and that differential effects on
downstream targets, such as AKT, are an essential feature.
Given its expression in nearly all neuroblastoma cell lines
and patient samples, and particularly its consistent surface
expression by flow cytometry, HER-4 is the most likely
ERBB receptor to explore in neuroblastoma. As mentioned before, little is known about the role of HER-4 in
tumorigenesis; however, its multiple isoforms, gammasecretase–mediated cleavage and the transcriptional effects
of its liberated intracellular domain, provide for multiple
mechanisms of dysregulation to be explored.35-39
Activating mutations in EGFR of nonsmall-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) can predict a response to erlotinib
treatment.40,41 An analysis of 36 neuroblastoma cell lines
revealed no EGFR mutations. Furthermore, no mutations
of K-Ras exon 2, which can cause resistance to cetuximab
in colorectal cancer,42 were found in 36 neuroblastoma
cell lines. Therefore, the lack of neuroblastoma response
to erlotinib was not due to the presence of any of the
known resistance-causing mutations.
Because there was no effect on neuroblastoma cell
growth in vitro with erlotinib treatment, we did not
expect suppression of tumor-cell growth in vivo with erlotinib. We were surprised, therefore, to find that erlotinibtreated xenograft tumors grew more slowly than the
untreated tumors. Given the limited effects of erlotinib in
vitro, the in vivo growth inhibition likely arose because of
modulation of the tumor microenvironment. We saw
strong colocalization of CD31 and EGFR by immunohistochemistry and, with erlotinib, found a trend toward
reduced mean vessel density. Given that erlotinib-treated
tumors were smaller than the untreated tumors and also
tended to have fewer vessels per high-powered field, it
seems likely that the total vessel content of erlotinibtreated tumors was truly less than that of untreated
tumors. However, our in vivo experiments were not powered nor designed to assess this difference. Although several reports have shown EGFR expression in endothelial
cells of tumor models and anti-EGFR treatment reducing
the endothelial cell number,28-31 others have not confirmed these findings. For example, Amin et al have
reported a decreased in vivo tumor volume in a melanoma
xenograft with gefitinib treatment, presumably through
targeting of blood vessels, but they did not find a decrease

in vessel density.31 Further analysis is required to determine the contribution of erlotinib and CI-1033 treatment
to angiogenesis in vivo. Given that interactions between
tumor cells and stromal elements appear to contribute to
ERBB’s impact on neuroblastoma growth, orthotopic
models in which neuroblastoma cells are placed under the
adrenal capsule may be the best models for addressing
these questions in vivo.
CI-1033, through its pan-ERBB inhibition, is likely
having an antiangiogenic effect through blockade of
EGFR and also a direct antitumor effect as seen in vitro.
This would account for smaller final tumor volume with
CI-1033 treatment, compared with erlotinib treatment.
However, the different targeting profiles, the irreversible
binding of CI-1033, and the bioavailability of erlotinib
and CI-1033 may also contribute to differences observed
in vivo. CI-1033 has been reported to reach a plasma level
of 1-3 lM in a mouse model with an oral dose of 20 mg/
kg,23 so the 30 mg/kg/day that we administered was
expected to reach concentrations where effects were
observed in vitro. It also is still expected to be specific for
all ERBB kinases at this concentration.27 The dose given
of erlotinib, 10 mg/kg/day, is equivalent to the dose currently given to lung cancer patients (150 mg). This dose
was also shown to have little toxicity in mice and to reach
a peak plasma level of about 13 lM after 0.5 hours,43
higher than the levels we found to be ineffective in vitro.
We chose this dose also because we wished to evaluate the
minimum of a biologically effective dose24 and to be certain that we were within the dose range in which the drug
remains specific for EGFR, because erlotinib can inhibit
HER-2 signaling at higher concentrations.44 At a dose of
10 mg/kg/day, serum concentrations of erlotinib are identical with either the intravenous or oral routes,24 and oral
administration at this dose has been shown to inhibit
EGFR autophosphorylation and EGFR-mediated growth
in xenograft models.
In summary, we report the cell surface protein
expression of multiple ERBB receptors in neuroblastoma,
notably EGFR and HER-4. We demonstrate multiple significant differences in the effects of an EGFR selective inhibitor, erlotinib, compared with a pan-ERBB inhibitor,
CI-1033, particularly their proapoptotic and antitumor
effects. Although further work to explore the direct effects
of non-EGFR ERBB signaling in neuroblastoma is
needed, we present data that support the use of panERBB inhibitors such as the successor compound to CI1033, PF-00299804, in neuroblastoma over the use of
EGFR-specific agents.
