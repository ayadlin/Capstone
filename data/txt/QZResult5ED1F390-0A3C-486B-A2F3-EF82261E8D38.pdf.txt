ABSTRACT
Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a tumor suppressor that regulates signaling
pathways by acting as a deubiquitinating enzyme. CYLD down-regulation occurred
in several malignancies, with tumor-promoting effects. Although we found loss of
CYLD expression in hypoxic regions of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the
most aggressive brain tumor, biological roles of CYLD in GBM remain unknown. This
study aimed to determine the biological significance of CYLD down-regulation to
GBM progression and therapy. CYLD mRNA transcription was dramatically downregulated in hypoxic GBM cells, consistent with our clinical observations of human
GBM tissues. Hypoxia enhanced both basal and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced
expression of various proinflammatory cytokines, whereas CYLD overexpression
strongly counteracted these responses. In addition, chronic anti-angiogenic therapy
with bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody,
with enhanced hypoxia produced responses similar to these CYLD-regulated
proinflammatory responses in a xenograft mouse model. Histologically, CYLD
clearly prevented massive immune cell infiltration surrounding necrotic regions, and
pseudopalisades appeared in bevacizumab-treated control tumors. Furthermore, CYLD
overexpression, which had no impact on survival by itself, significantly improved the
prosurvival effect of bevacizumab. These data suggest that CYLD down-regulation is
crucial for hypoxia-mediated inflammation in GBM, which may affect the long-term
efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy.

INTRODUCTION

by anti-angiogenic treatment on tumor progression during
therapy and ultimately on overall survival in GBM patients
remain uncertain.
Cylindromatosis (CYLD) was first identified in
familial cylindromatosis as a mutant tumor suppressor
gene [24]. CYLD is a deubiquitination enzyme targeting
lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains and was shown to
negatively regulate signal transduction factors and
pathways including transforming growth factor-β and NFκB signaling pathways [25-27]. CYLD regulates diverse
biological processes including cell proliferation, survival,
and migration; immune responses; osteoclastogenesis;
and spermatogenesis [26]. With regard to malignancies,
reduced expression and mutation of CYLD, with tumorpromoting effects, were reported for several cancers
including melanoma, T-cell leukemia, hepatocellular
carcinoma, and breast cancer [28-31]. CYLD expression
was recently shown to be reduced in gliomas, with an
inverse correlation with tumor grade and prognosis [32].
However, mechanisms underlying CYLD down-regulation
and involvement of CYLD in pathological processes
crucial for GBM progression, including hypoxia response
and treatment resistance, remain largely unknown.
In our study here, we found CYLD down-regulation
in hypoxic regions of human GBM tissues, with CYLD
acting as a critical regulator of hypoxia-mediated
inflammation in GBM, which may be associated with
resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. These findings may
allow insights into the role of CYLD in the pathogenesis
of GBM and may contribute to improve the survival
benefit of anti-VEGF therapy in GBM.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common
primary malignant brain tumor, has features of rapid and
invasive growth in the brain [1]. The median overall
survival of patients who have standard and targeted
therapies is still just more than 1 year, mostly because
of resistance to therapy [2]. Because few therapeutic
targets are available for GBM, better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of GBM progression and therapy
resistance is important.
Hypoxia, a characteristic of malignant tumors,
frequently outpaces their blood supply [3]. Hypoxic
regions often occur in GBM, and increased tumor hypoxia
is associated with the resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation and the poor prognosis of GBM patients [4].
The hypoxic microenvironment promotes invasion and
treatment resistance of GBM cells, and glioma-initiating
cells possess strong drug resistance and tumorigenicity
[4, 5]. Pseudopalisading cells commonly surround
hypoxia-induced necrotic areas, a configuration that
is unique to GBM and has been recognized for some
time as a feature indicating poor prognosis [6]. Of note,
several recent publications have discussed the clinical
significance of hypoxia-elicited inflammation [7]. The
inflammatory microenvironment, the seventh hallmark
of cancer, generally promotes malignant progression
[8]. Indeed, various inflammatory cytokines promote
the growth, survival, and invasion of GBM cells [9-11].
Increased expression of inflammatory cytokines including
angiogenic mediators such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) has been associated with the poor prognosis
of GBM [9-13]. Hypoxia promoted the activation of
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a primary mediator of
inflammatory responses, and was involved in regulating
the inflammatory microenvironment [7, 8, 14-17].
However, little is still known about molecular mechanisms
linking hypoxia and inflammation and the effects of this
relationship on GBM progression and treatment resistance.
In addition to the hypoxic microenvironment being
clinically significant for GBM, vascularization is critical:
GBM is one of the most highly vascularized tumors
and expresses high levels of VEGF, which is therefore
an attractive target for anti-angiogenic therapies [18].
Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against
VEGF, is approved for recurrent and newly diagnosed
GBM. Clinical trials with bevacizumab produced
impressive radiographic responses and prolongation of
progression-free survival. However, GBM inevitably
progresses within months [19], and the impact of this
therapy on overall survival is not clear [20, 21]. Recent
evidence has indicated that prolonged anti-angiogenic
treatment leads to tumors developing progressive hypoxia,
which is thought to be important for resistance to therapy,
in view of basal tumor-promoting roles of hypoxia in
GBM [22, 23]. However, the effects of hypoxia induced

RESULTS
Hypoxia-induced
CYLD
Down-regulation
May Be Associated with the Inflammatory
Microenvironment in GBM
To investigate CYLD expression in GBM, we first
performed immunohistochemical analysis with antiCYLD antibody in human GBM tissues (n = 48). As
Figure 1A shows, some GBM cells appeared to be positive
for CYLD immunoreactivity. Our additional comparison
with expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a wellknown marker of hypoxia, clearly showed a loss of CYLD
immunoreactivity in hypoxic regions, defined as showing
a high CA IX expression (Fig. 1A). To determine whether
hypoxia influences CYLD expression, we cultured
U87MG cells under hypoxic conditions of 1% O2. We
confirmed an increased expression of the hypoxia markers
CA IX and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Fig. 1B left
panel). Consistent with our clinical observations, CYLD
mRNA expression was dramatically reduced in U87MG
cells under hypoxic conditions in a time-dependent
6354

manner (Fig. 1B right panel). After 48 h of hypoxic
culture, the CYLD mRNA level significantly decreased to
only 2.3% of that of normoxic culture. We also confirmed
reduced CYLD expression at the protein level (Fig. 1B
right panel), which suggests involvement of CYLD in
certain hypoxia-related processes in GBM.
Some publications have discussed hypoxia-elicited
inflammation [7, 14, 15], and a loss of CYLD has been
associated with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines
and various immune processes [25, 26]. Indeed, CYLD
knockdown by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)
significantly increased expression of the proinflammatory
cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in GBM cells (Fig.
1C). We also found that hypoxia significantly increased
expression of typical proinflammatory cytokines including
IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α

in GBM cells (Fig. 1D left panel). Moreover, hypoxia
strongly enhanced TNF-α-triggered induction of IL-6, IL1β, and TNF-α compared with normoxia (Fig. 1D right
panels), which indicates increased sensitivity of hypoxic
GBM cells to inflammatory stimuli. Together, these
findings suggest that hypoxia-induced CYLD reduction
may be involved in inflammatory responses in GBM.

CYLD Inhibited Hypoxia-induced Inflammatory
Responses
To determine whether a substantial reduction in
CYLD expression played a vital role in induction of
proinflammatory cytokines and an excessive response
to inflammatory stimuli under hypoxic conditions, we

inflammatory mediators. In addition to expression of IL6, IL-8, and IL-1β, expression of interleukins IL-1F5 and
IL-1F8 and of chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL2
increased significantly during hypoxia (Fig. 2C). In fact,
CYLD overexpression completely blocked hypoxiamediated induction of those inflammatory mediators and
suppressed basal expression of some cytokines (IL-6, IL8, IL1β, IL-1F5, IL-1F8, and CXCL2) (Fig. 2C). CYLD
overexpression also significantly suppressed a synergistic
increase in IL-6 or IL-1β expression induced by TNF-α
stimulation in hypoxia (Fig. 2D). These results indicated
that a hypoxia-induced CYLD decrease contributed
to induction of inflammatory mediators and increase
in sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli under hypoxic
conditions in GBM cells.

We next sought to validate our in vitro findings in
an in vivo model. Given that angiogenesis is essential
for O2 supply and nutrition during tumor growth [3, 4],
we utilized anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab,
an anti-VEGF antibody used for GBM, to enhance
hypoxia in GBM xenografts. We found no quantitative
difference in microvessel density and tumor growth
between U87MG-vector and U87MG-CYLD xenografts
(Fig. 3A left and middle panels, and data not shown).
Bevacizumab treatment had almost the same inhibitory

effect on vascularization (U87MG-vector, 53%; U87MGCYLD, 51%) and tumor growth in both groups (Fig. 3A
left and middle panels, and data not shown). These results
indicated that high levels of CYLD in GBM cells had little
impact on angiogenesis and the anti-angiogenic efficacy
of bevacizumab. We also confirmed that bevacizumab
treatment significantly increased CA IX mRNA expression
(Fig. 3A right panel), which indicates an increase in
hypoxic regions. Our histological examinations thus
clearly indicated that necrotic areas increased in both
tumors (Fig. 3B left and middle panels). Of note, we
observed wide invasion fronts surrounding necrotic areas
(Fig. 3B upper middle panel) and, at higher magnification,
frequent perinecrotic pseudopalisades, a configuration
that indicates migrating hypoxic GBM cells [6], with
massive infiltration of inflammatory cells in bevacizumabtreated tumors (Fig. 3B upper right panel). Particularly
notable findings included CYLD-overexpressing tumors
having a smoother hypoxic margin consisting of round
tumor cells even after treatment (Fig. 3B lower middle
and right panels). In addition, infiltration of CD45+
inflammatory cells surrounding hypoxic margin in CYLDoverexpressing tumors after treatment was significantly
fewer than control tumors (Fig. 3C). Together, these
findings suggest that CYLD restricts infiltration of
inflammatory cells and invasion enhanced by increased
hypoxia after anti-VEGF therapy in GBM.

of CYLD overexpression in GBM cells on survival was
not significant. In fact, although continued bevacizumab
treatment significantly prolonged survival of both groups
of mice (U87MG-vector, P = 0.0138; U87MG-CYLD, P<
0.0001, log-rank test), the survival time of treated mice
bearing CYLD-overexpressing tumors was significantly
longer than that of treated mice bearing control tumors
(median survival 12.0 weeks vs 16.3 weeks, P = 0.0028,
log-rank test). These findings suggest that CYLD improves
the survival of bevacizumab-treated GBM-bearing mice
via inhibition of therapy-induced inflammatory responses.

DISCUSSION
Hypoxia is a significant biological phenomenon
in various solid tumors. Given the well-established
clinical relationship between increased hypoxia and GBM
progression [4, 5, 33], targeting hypoxia-induced processes
may be essential for developing successful treatment
of GBM. The most important finding from this study is
that hypoxia-induced CYLD reduction may be critical
for inflammatory responses triggered by hypoxia. In a
recent report, gliomas had reduced CYLD expression that
was inversely correlated with tumor grade and prognosis
[32]. In the present study, our thorough assessment of
clinical samples and in vitro analysis revealed that CYLD
expression was reduced under hypoxic conditions via
transcriptional regulation. As of today, little is still known
about transcriptional regulation of CYLD. However,
CYLD mRNA transcription is directly inhibited by Snail
[28] and the Notch target Hes1 [29], both of which are upregulated and activated under hypoxic conditions [34, 35].
Another finding worth noting is that hypoxia stimulates
human papilloma virus-encoded E6 protein to promote
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYLD in
human papilloma virus-positive squamous cell carcinoma
cell lines [36]. With regard to downstream CYLD signals,
mounting evidence that CYLD negatively regulates NFκB activity [8, 16] substantially supports our findings.
Because TNF-α rapidly activates the NF-κB pathway
[8], an excessive inflammatory response to the cytokine
under hypoxic conditions may be due largely to CYLD
down-regulation. It is interesting that our data showed, for
the first time to our knowledge, inhibition by CYLD of
the expression of several cytokines in a hypoxia-specific
manner, which indicated the presence of hypoxia-specific
molecular mechanisms regulated by CYLD. Although
additional studies are needed to clarify the molecular
mechanisms, our in vitro data suggested that hypoxiainduced CYLD reduction may promote inflammation in
an autocrine and paracrine fashion in GBM tissues.
Chronic anti-angiogenic therapy induces hypoxia,
which is thought to be crucial for resistance to such
therapy [22, 23]. In the present study, we found that
chronic administration of bevacizumab, a monoclonal
anti-VEGF antibody used for GBM, induced expression

CYLD Improved Survival of Bevacizumabtreated GBM-bearing Mice via Suppression of
Inflammatory Cytokines
We next investigated expression of proinflammatory
cytokines and determined the involvement of CYLD in
long-term efficacy of bevacizumab in the GBM xenograft
model. Consistent with the results of hypoxic culture
in vitro, the expression of several proinflammatory
cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 families (IL1F5, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9), CXCL5, and CCL5, increased
significantly in human U87MG-vector cells in mouse
xenografts after chronic bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 4A).
CYLD overexpression suppressed expression of these
cytokines to the same or lower level than that in untreated
tumors. Expression of certain cytokines such as CXCL1,
CXCL2, and CCL2, which were not apparently induced by
treatment, was also significantly down-regulated by CYLD
overexpression after treatment. Our analysis using heat
maps showed more clearly the similarities in expression
patterns of different cytokines in in vitro hypoxic culture
and after in vivo bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 4B), which
indicates that CYLD indeed acted as a negative regulator
of hypoxia-mediated inflammation.
We also investigated whether CYLD overexpression
in GBM cells affected survival of mice with or without
bevacizumab treatment. As Figure 4C illustrates, the effect

of proinflammatory cytokines with massive infiltration
of immune cells in GBM xenografts. One important
finding was that CYLD overexpression in GBM cells
not only prevented those proinflammatory responses
but also significantly improved the prosurvival effect of
bevacizumab, which by itself had no impact on survival.
Although many clinical trials of bevacizumab showed
prolonged progression-free survival, the impact of this
therapy on overall survival remains limited in GBM and
other cancers [19-21], which reflects multiple mechanisms
of adaptation to this treatment. Consistent with this result,
because no apparent difference in basal vascularity, tumor
growth, and anti-angiogenic efficacy itself of bevacizumab
between the two tumor groups was observed, the
prosurvival effect of CYLD overexpression may depend
on modulation of phenotypic alterations occurring during
bevacizumab treatment. Growing evidence exists that antiVEGF treatment has antitumor effects but simultaneously
induces tumor adaptation and progression to greater
malignancy, with increased invasiveness [19, 37]. Indeed,
we clearly found pseudopalisades, a characteristic feature
of GBM that is currently thought to indicate tumor cells’
actively migrating away from central hypoxic areas [6, 38,
39].
Among high-grade gliomas, the mesenchymal
type, characterized as having gene expression associated
with invasion, is in the class with the worst prognosis,
with treatment resistance [40, 41]. Several clinical and
preclinical studies with U87MG cells demonstrated that
mesenchymal transition of GBM cells during chronic
anti-VEGF treatment underlies a diffuse relapse [42-45].
The predominant biological process occurring during the
transition was an inflammatory response [43, 44]. Also,
TNF-α converted GBM cells to a mesenchymal subtype
[11]. In addition, increased infiltration of myeloid cells
reflected recurrence after anti-angiogenic therapy [44,
46, 47]. Such an increased myeloid cell influx correlated
strongly with the degree of tumor hypoxia [44]. Moreover,
hypoxic GBM cells including pseudopalisading cells [6]
highly expressed the mesenchymal marker c-Met [45].
Thus, the increased invasiveness of GBM cells
during anti-VEGF therapy is likely due to an enhanced
inflammatory milieu associated with hypoxia induction.
Together, our data suggest that inhibition of the GBM cellderived inflammatory response by CYLD overexpression
led to less aggressiveness, including invasion, and
ultimately better survival although orthotopic xenograft
model for exact prognostic evaluation remains to be
examined. The concept that regulation of inflammatory
processes is important during anti-VEGF therapies may
be supported by a recent finding that indirect activation of
helper T17 cells by bevacizumab was crucial for acquired
resistance to the therapy [48]. Continued investigation
should contribute to clarification of mechanisms
underlying resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies that
inevitably facilitate hypoxia, and development of efficient
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination therapy based on “action-reaction” theory
[49].
In conclusion, we demonstrated that CYLD acts as
a critical regulator of hypoxia-mediated inflammation in
GBM, which may affect the long-term efficacy of antiVEGF therapy. Deeper understanding of the mechanisms
linking hypoxia-induced CYLD down-regulation and
inflammation, and adaptive changes in GBM tissues
during anti-VEGF therapy, may provide insights into
GBM pathobiology and development of more effective
therapeutic approaches to GBM.

and cells were selected with G418 (300 µg/mL).

injections of 100 µL of PBS containing bevacizumab
(Avastin; Genentech, Roche, Basel, Switzerland; 5 mg/
kg) or PBS alone every 3 days. For survival experiments,
treatment continued until the mice died. For tumor
analyses, mice (n = 3 or 4/group) were killed on day 18
after treatments started and tumors were removed. Pieces
of tumor tissues were sharply excised, placed in sterile
tubes, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All
tissue samples for quantitative PCR (qPCR) were stored
at −80°C until analysis. For immunohistochemical and
hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, tumor tissues were
fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin.

Transfection with siRNA
Cells were transfected with CYLD-specific
siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Silencer Negative Control siRNA (Applied Biosystems,
Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) was used as
the control. CYLD-specific siRNA sequences were sense
5′- GAUUGUUACUUCUAUCAAAtt-3′ and antisense

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed specimens of clinical tissues and
excised tumor tissues from SCID mice were embedded
in paraffin, cut into 4-µm-thick sections, and mounted
on slides. These paraffin-embedded sections were
dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols.
For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with
proteinase K (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 15 min at
room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked
by incubating slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30
min. After slides were washed with PBS, nonspecific
background staining was blocked by using nonspecific

by overnight incubation at 4°C with anti-human CYLD
antibody (1:200), anti-human CA IX antibody (1:1000),
anti-mouse CD45 antibody (1:50), or anti-mouse CD31
antibody (1:50) diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin. After slides were rinsed with PBS, they
were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. Chromogen was
developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Dako). All slides
were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. For H&E
staining, sections were stained in hematoxylin for 1 min
and eosin for 30 s.
The number of CD45+ cells was determined in 10
fields per section at ×200 in areas identified as “hot spots”
at ×40 surrounding necrotic areas. Results were expressed
as an average of the total number of CD45+ cells in each
field.

Hypoxia Induction
In vitro experiments were performed in a
temperature- and humidity-controlled hypoxic chamber set
at 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 (CO2 multigas incubator

were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions
for 48 h and were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α for the
indicated periods.

Tumor Xenograft Generation and Bevacizumab
Treatment
Male CB17/ICR-scid/scid mice (SCID mice), each
8 weeks old and weighing 20–25 g, were obtained from
CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in a specific
pathogen-free environment at the Center for Animal
Resources and Development of Kumamoto University.
All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by
the Kumamoto University Ethics Committee for Animal
Experiments (authorization number in Kumamoto
University: C23-319, C24-212). U87MG-vector and
U87MG-CYLD cells were trypsinized, washed with
serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and
Ham’s F-12 medium, and resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), after which their concentration was
adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/100 µL in PBS. Cell suspensions
were then injected subcutaneously into SCID mice.
Tumor development was followed in individual animals
by sequential caliper measurements of length (L) and
width (W). Tumor volume was calculated by the formula
LW2π/6. When the average tumor volume was 500 mm3,
each mouse (n = 7–12/group) received intraperitoneal

RNA Isolation and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from tissue specimens
and treated cells by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and was reverse transcribed to cDNA
by using the ExScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc.,
Otsu, Japan), according to the manufacturers’ protocols.
All PCR reactions were performed via the LightCycler
System (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) with
SYBR Premix DimerEraser (Takara Bio Inc.). Primers
used for qPCR were as follows: CYLD forward:

Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting

3.	

Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and
then lysed by adding CelLytic M Cell Lysis/Extraction
Reagent (Sigma) containing freshly added protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM
Na3VO4. Supernatants were stored at −80°C until use.
Equal amounts of protein were fractionated via sodium
dodecyl sulfate−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked with
5% non-fat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in
PBS (pH 7.4) and were then incubated overnight at 4°C
with antibodies against IL-6 (1:2000), CYLD (1:600),
FLAG (1:3800), or β-actin (1:5000) in 5% bovine serum
albumin (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (pH 7.4).
After the membranes were washed in 0.1% Tween 20 in
PBS (pH 7.4), they were incubated for 1 h in horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. After
another washing, specific protein bands were detected by
using ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagents
(Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
