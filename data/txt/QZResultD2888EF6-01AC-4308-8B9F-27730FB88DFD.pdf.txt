ABSTRACT
The dramatic responses tumors display to targeted therapies are limited by
acquired or pre-existing mechanisms of therapy resistance. We recently discovered
that androgen receptor blockade by the anti-androgen enzalutamide paradoxically
enhanced metastasis and that these pro-metastatic effects were mediated by the
chemoattractant CCL2. CCL2 is regulated by TNF, which is negatively regulated by
androgen signaling. Thus, we asked if TNF mediates the pro-metastatic effects of
enzalutamide. We found that androgen withdrawal or enzalutamide induced TNF
mRNA and protein secretion in castration resistant prostate cancer (C4-2) cells,
but not in macrophage-like (THP1) or myofibroblast-like (WPMY1) cells. Androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) induced autocrine CCL2 expression in C4-2 (as well as
a murine CRPC cell line), while exogenous TNF induced CCL2 in THP1 and WPMY1.
TNF was most potent in myofibroblast cultures, suggesting ADT induces CCL2 via
paracrine interactions within the tumor microenvironment. A soluble TNF receptor
(etanercept) blocked enzalutamide-induced CCL2 protein secretion and mRNA,
implying dependence on secreted TNF. A small molecule inhibitor of CCR2 (the CCL2
receptor) significantly reduced TNF induced migration, while etanercept inhibited
enzalutamide-induced migration and invasion of C4-2. Analysis of human prostate
cancers suggests that a TNF-CCL2 paracrine loop is induced in response to ADT and
might account for some forms of prostate cancer therapy resistance.

therapy resistance [3]. The best understood mechanisms
are secondary missense mutations in driver genes. The
T790M ‘gateway’ mutation in the EGFR produces
erlotinib and gefitinib resistance [4–6], while the F876L
mutation in the AR converts enzalutamide from an
antagonist to an agonist [7–9]. Epigenetic mechanisms
can alter the expression of splice variants, such as those
encoding ligand-independent versions of the AR, which
are expressed at increased levels in treatment resistant

INTRODUCTION
The concept of ‘oncogene addiction’ [1] has
given rise to targeted cancer therapy, which is effective
in treating cancers dependent on the corresponding
oncogenic driver [2]. Examples include the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the androgen
receptor (AR). However, the dramatic responses to
targeted therapy are limited by pre-existing or acquired

prostate cancers [10]. Non-genetic mechanisms are not as
well understood, but may play a role in treatment failure.
In this report, we show that androgen deprivation therapy
can paradoxically activate a pro-tumorigenic signaling
mechanism that is dependent on paracrine interactions
within the tumor microenvironment.
We (SY and CC) recently discovered that androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) unexpectedly enhances the
metastatic phenotype of castration resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC), even as these therapies inhibit tumor growth
[11–13]. Specifically, treatment with the anti-androgens
bicalutamide and enzalutamide inhibited proliferation but
induced macrophage migration and tumor cell invasion in
vitro as well as distant metastases in orthotopic tumor models
of CRPC [11]. This may reflect a divergence between the
effects of AR signaling on proliferation compared to the
effects on the metastatic phenotype. These pro-metastatic
effects are mediated by CCL2 [11, 12], a chemokine also
known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 that binds
the cognate receptor CCR2 to induce chemotaxis [14, 15].
Monocytes are a major source of CCL2 [15], but CCL2
is also produced by a variety of cells in tumors, including
epithelial tumor cells and the cellular components of the
tumor microenvironment, such as endothelium, stroma and
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [14]. In addition,
studies of prostate cancer (PCa) patient serum and/or tumor
tissue samples support a role for CCL2 in ADT-induced
metastasis [11, 12, 16]. We (KLN and JJK) have also
previously demonstrated that TNF is negatively regulated by
androgens [17]. Specifically, castration induces TNF mRNA
in rodent prostatic stroma. Promoter analysis has shown that
CCL2 is regulated by TNF via NFκB [18]. Indeed, it has
been reported that TNF induces CCL2 expression in ovarian
cancer cells [19] as well as sensory neurons [20–22], and
vascular smooth muscle cells [23]. Given these two sets
of previous findings from our laboratories, we tested the
hypothesis that TNF signaling is required for enzalutamide
induced metastasis of CRPC via CCL2.

a human acute monocytic leukemia, displays monocytic
markers, has phagocytic activity and expresses CCR2 [28],
indicating that it is a model for TAMs [29].
Following treatment with dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), TNF secretion was reduced in C4-2 (Figure 1a).

RESULTS
Androgen deprivation induces TNF expression
To address the role of TNF in metastasis following
androgen deprivation, we initially employed three cell lines,
representing CRPC (C4-2), prostate stromal myofibroblasts
(WPMY-1) and tumor associated macrophages (THP-1),
either alone, in co-culture or via conditioned media, to
simulate the in vivo context of PCa. C4-2, a sub-line of the
human androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell
line, derived by selecting for growth as a xenograft in a
castrated athymic nude mouse [24–26], is a well-established
cell line model for CRPC. WPMY-1 is an SV40 large-T
antigen-immortalized myofibroblast cell line (expressing
smooth muscle α-actin and vimentin), derived from a
cancerous human prostate [26]. THP-1 [27] is derived from

TNF is required for CCL2 secretion

Conversely, treatment of C4-2 with the anti-androgen
enzalutamide induced TNF secretion and an increase
in mRNA expression (Figure 1b–1c). The coordinate
increase in both protein and mRNA is consistent with
transcriptional repression of the TNF gene by the
AR. However, we cannot exclude effects on mRNA
stability. Neither DHT nor enzalutamide affected
TNF expression in the TAM-like THP-1 or stromal
myofibroblast-like WPMY-1 cell lines. Similarly, in
the rat stroma-derived PS-1 cells, there was no change
in TNF expression in response to enzalutamide (data
not shown). The anti-androgen bicalutamide and the
synthetic androgen R1881 had analogous effects to
enzalutamide and DHT, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S1). Similar levels of TNF secretion, following
DHT withdrawal or enzalutamide treatment, were
observed when C4-2 cells were co-cultured with THP1 and/or WPMY-1 cells (Figure 2).

Since we previously observed that androgen
deprivation induced CCL2 [11], we measured CCL2
secretion and mRNA in the cultures examined in
Figure 1 and observed an identical pattern, correlating
TNF and CCL2 expression at the protein and mRNA
levels (Figure 3). CCL2 and TNF secretion were
also coincident in C4-2 treated with bicalutamide

or R1881 (Supplementary Figure S2). To determine
if CCL2 expression was regulated by TNF, we
employed etanercept, a soluble receptor composed
of the extracellular domain of the p75 TNF receptor
(TNFR2) fused to the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin
protein. Etanercept binds TNF avidly and with high
specificity [30], making this an ideal reagent for
testing the role of secreted or membrane bound TNF
in mediating intracellular signaling events. Figure 4
demonstrates that etanercept blocked enzalutamide
induced secretion of the CCL2 protein (Figure 4a) as
well as the induction of CCL2 mRNA levels (Figure
4b). This suggests autocrine TNF signaling can regulate
transcription of the CCL2 gene (or, alternatively, CCL2
mRNA stability) in C4-2 cells. Etanercept also blocked
CCL2 secretion, but not the mRNA level, in WPMY1 myofibroblasts (Figure 4). However, enzalutamide
did not induce TNF production at either the protein or
mRNA level in WPMY-1 (Figure 1b–1c).

Figures 1–4 indicate that TNF signaling mediates
ADT induced transcription and secretion of CCL2 by
C4-2 CRPC cells. To determine if our observations in
C4-2 cells are representative of the response of CRPC
to ADT, we examined PTEN-CaP8, a murine CRPC
cell line derived from prostate-specific Pten null mice
homozygously deleted for PTEN [31]. To do this, we
replicated the experiments shown in Figures 3a–3b
and Figure 4a, employing PTEN-CaP8 in place of
C4-2 cells and found that PTEN-CaP8 cells responded
the same as C4-2 cells (Figure 5a). Specifically,
DHT reduced, and enzalutamide induced, CCL2
secretion in PTEN-CaP8 cells and etanercept blocked
enzalutamide-induced CCL2 production (Figure
5a). Thus, TNF-mediated CCL2 induction may be a
typical response of CRPC to ADT. To verify that this
response is a feature of CRPC cell lines, we examined
the isogenic parental lines that are the progenitors of
PTEN-CaP8 and C4-2. These cell lines (PTEN-P8
and LNCaP, respectively) resemble localized prostate
cancers; that is, these are less advanced versions of
the corresponding CRPC cell line. For both PTEN-P8
and LNCaP, the effects of blocking androgen signaling
were less pronounced. Importantly, even when
regulated by ADT, etanercept did not block CCL2
production (Figure 5b, 5c), indicating that these less
advanced cell lines are distinct from the CRPC cell
lines. Taken together, this suggests that ADT-induced,
TNF-dependent CCL2 production is a feature of CRPC.

TNF blockade reduces paracrine CCL2 secretion
To directly test the requirement for TNF, C4-2,
THP-1 and WPMY-1 cells were treated with TNF, and
CCL2 secretion and mRNA was measured (Figure 6).
The two microenvironment-derived cell lines (THP-1
and WPMY-1, representing TAMs and myofibroblast
stromal cells, respectively) demonstrated increased CCL2
expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, in
response to TNF (Figure 6a–6d).
Surprisingly, C4-2 cells, which produce CCL2 in a
TNF-dependent, autocrine manner (Figures 3–4), did not
show significant modulation of CCL2 in response to TNF
(Figure 6e–6f), even though exogenous TNF was employed at
doses that exceed the concentration of soluble TNF detected
in C4-2 media following androgen deprivation (5–10 pg/
mL; data not shown). This suggests that TNF concentrations
determined by ELISA in cell culture media might not reflect
the concentration available to receptors on the C4-2 cell
surface. Indeed, TNF is expressed in a membrane-bound
form, which is cleaved by the extracellular protease TACE
to generate the soluble (‘secreted’) form of the cytokine
[32]. Since membrane-bound TNF is biologically active
and cannot be detected in ELISA assays of cell culture
media, we may have significantly underestimated the
biologically effective TNF concentration that is required

to trigger the autocrine effects in the single cell culture
conditions we employed in Figures 3 and 4. This suggests the
possibility that microenvironment cell lines, which are more
responsive to TNF (see Figure 6a–6d versus Figure 6e–6f),
might be the relevant source of CCL2 in the in vivo tumor
context. Thus, the production of CCL2 may be mediated
by paracrine interactions between the tumor cells and the
microenvironment, rather than autocrine production of CCL2
by the C4-2 prostate cancer tumor cells. To test this, we mixed
C4-2 tumor cells with either THP-1 or WPMY-1 cells, and
blocked androgen binding and signaling in these co-cultures,
using the androgen antagonist enzalutamide. In both mixed
cultures (C4-2 tumor cells plus WPMY-1 myofibroblasts
(Figure 7a), and C4-2 tumor cells plus THP-1 TAM-like cells
(Figure 7b)), enzalutamide induced CCL2 and etanercept
blocked CCL2 induction, consistent with our proposed
paracrine mechanism.

TNF is required for migration and invasion
As noted, we have previously demonstrated that
enzalutamide induces a metastatic phenotype in both cell
culture and mouse models of CRPC [11]. To determine if TNF
regulation of CCL2 is required for the metastatic phenotype,
we performed three experiments. First, we demonstrated that
TNF induces migration of tumor associated macrophage-like
THP-1 and CRPC C4-2 cells in a cell culture model of the
tumor microenvironment (Figure 8). Specifically, conditioned
media (CM) from TNF-treated WPMY-1 cells, expected to
contain biologically active concentrations of CCL2 (Figure
6g), was placed in the bottom of a transwell chamber (Figure
8a). Both THP-1 and C4-2 cells migrated towards the CM,
and migration was reduced by a CCR2 inhibitor (Figure
8b–8d). Notably, neither C4-2 nor THP-1 cells migrated
towards media plus recombinant TNF (Supplementary
Figure S3). Also, TNF did not enhance C4-2 proliferation
(Supplementary Figure S4), arguing that increased cell
numbers do not account for increased migration. Second,
paracrine CCL2, produced by enzalutamide treatment,
induced migration of C4-2 (Figure 9). In these experiments,
CM was from enzalutamide-treated C4-2/WPMY-1 (Figure
9a, 9b) or C4-2/THP-1 (Figure 9c, 9d) mixed cultures. Again,
the enzalutamide-treated CM is expected to contain higher
levels of CCL2 (relative to the vehicle-treated control), in this
case due to enzalutamide induction of TNF (Figure 7). C4-2
migration towards the CM was inhibited when etanercept
was present during CM production, thereby blocking TNFmediated paracrine CCL2 secretion. Finally, we replicated
the experiment in Figure 9, but measured invasion, i.e.,
migration through a Matrigel-coated membrane. C4-2 cells
were induced to invade, in a TNF-dependent manner, by
C4-2/WPMY-1 CM (Figure 10a, 10b) but not by C4-2/THP1 CM (Figure 10c, 10d), consistent with the relatively higher
level of TNF-dependent CCL2 production by WPMY-1
cultures (Figure 6g).

TNF and CCL2 expression in prostate cancers

been uncertain [39]. Castration-induced regression (due
to epithelial cell apoptosis) in normal rodent prostate
requires TNF up-regulation [17] and down-regulation of
the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP [40], but in CRPC c-FLIP
expression is increased [41], blocking the pro-apoptotic
effects of TNF and inducing NFκB, which promotes cell
survival [42]. The induction of metastases by ADT, even
as the primary tumor regresses [11–13], suggests a stagespecific role for TNF in CRPC, similar to TGFß, which
inhibits early cancers and promotes late stage cancer
metastasis [43, 44]. First we demonstrated that in C4-2
CRPC tumor cells, various modes of androgen deprivation
de-repress TNF mRNA expression, leading to secretion
into the media (Figures 1–2). Enzalutamide-induced
CCL2 mRNA and protein is dependent on secreted
TNF in these cells (Figure 3–4), since it is blocked by a
soluble receptor. Figure 5 demonstrates that ADT-induced
TNF signaling can enhance CCL2 secretion in a second
CRPC-derived cell line (PTEN-CaP8), but not in the less
advanced parental cell lines that gave rise to both C4-2
and PTEN-CaP8. This suggests the possibility that a
common mechanism driving the evolution of CRPCs also
selects for CCL2 expression in response to TNF signaling
(likely among other pro-tumorigenic features). In support
of this concept, Qin et al. [45] found that ADT of LNCaP
cells enriches for a minority LNCaP cell population
(PSA-/lo cells) that displays a castration-resistant cancer
phenotype, including the ability to grow in castrate hosts,
and enhanced expression of cancer stem cell genes. A
similar selection process may have been at work in the
development of C4-2 and PTEN-CaP8 from the respective
parental cell lines LNCaP and PTEN-P8 [24, 25, 31].

It is important to consider our findings in the context
of human cancers. A key study [16] sampled PCa patients
within three months of initiating ADT, when AR signaling is
still likely suppressed (i.e., prior to the onset of CRPC), and
found elevated serum TNF and CCL2 correlated with reduced
survival. To gain additional insight into the correlation
between PCa metastasis, CCL2 and TNF, we interrogated
two sets of metastatic CRPC patient samples [33, 34] using
Oncomine [35]. In these patients AR signaling is typically
reactivated, and indeed AR mRNA expression levels are
increased in both data sets (Figure 11a). TNF mRNA was
significantly elevated in CRPC patient samples (Figure 11b;
see also Supplementary Figure S5). In contrast, CCL2 mRNA
was significantly reduced in both data sets (Figure 11c),
which may reflect induction of CCL2 at the primary tumor
site only [48], rather than also at the metastatic tumor site
(see Discussion). Moreover, a similar pattern (AR increased,
CCL2 significantly decreased) is observed in metastases from
patients who did not receive ADT (Supplementary Figure S6,
Supplementary Table S1), supporting the idea that CCL2 is
only required at the primary tumor site.

DISCUSSION
Observations that TNF can transcriptionally regulate
the CCL2 gene [18], that NFκB is up-regulated in PCa
[36–38], and that ADT induced metastasis is dependent
on CCL2 [11–13], led us to test the hypothesis that
TNF mediates the paradoxical induction of metastasis
that occurs following ADT. The role of TNF in PCa has

Thus, we speculate that the ADT-induced production
of CCL2 via TNF signaling is a feature of a population
resembling PSA-/lo (progenitor) cells, and contributes to
the aggressive tumor phenotype of this cancer population,
which expands following ADT [45].

employing mixed cultures of tumor and microenvironment
cells (Figure 7) and, analogously, by measuring in vitro
metastatic phenotypes (migration and invasion) that
depend on CCL2 signaling. Again, exogenous cytokine
addition or conditioned media – both mimicking
possible paracrine effects within the microenvironment demonstrated a functional role for TNF in the paracrine

loop controlling metastasis in response to enzalutamide
(Figures 8–10). We therefore propose that tumor cells
secrete TNF, which induces CCL2 production in two
microenvironment cells (myofibroblasts and macrophages)
promoting tumor migration, invasion and extravasation
[46] and monocyte recruitment and differentiation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

into tumor associated macrophages [12, 14]. Figure 12
illustrates the paracrine interactions mediating ADT
induced metastasis via the chemotactic activities of CCL2.
In our model system, enzalutamide induces TNF
modestly and only in CRPC cells, but is sufficient to
up-regulate CCL2 mRNA expression and CCL2 protein

secretion, particularly in the WPMY-1 myofibroblast
cells. Previously, we had shown that castration of
rodents induced TNF mRNA expression in stromal, but
not the epithelial cells of the normal prostate [17]. The
observations reported here, that androgen deprivation
induces TNF mRNA expression in an epithelial tumor
cell line, but not the myofibroblast stromal cell line,
may reflect differences inherent in tumor and tumorassociated cells as a result of the process of tumorigenesis.

As expected, there is a correlation between the level of
TNF secretion and the extent of invasion, which is
a more stringent criteria of the metastatic phenotype
(Figure 10). Although cell culture models facilitated
our identification of key paracrine interactions in the
cancer microenvironment, there are limitations in
extrapolation to in vivo situations. In particular, our
culture conditions may not reproduce the proportions
of cellular constituents or the effective concentration of

demonstrate that conditional deletion or silencing of
AR in macrophages and PCa xenografts induces CCL2,
macrophage infiltration of xenografts and metastasis [12].
Previously we showed that enzalutamide induces CCL2
in TRAMP-C1 xenografts, and that castration similarly
induces CCL2 in normal mouse prostate [12]. Moreover,
enzalutamide-enhanced metastasis has been observed in
other CRPC models [47]. Future studies in mouse models
are needed to confirm the microenvironment source(s) of
TNF and verify a functional role for TNF in ADT induced
metastasis in vivo.
Finally, a variety of data from PCa patients support
our hypothesis. For example, we found CCL2 expression in
human PCa samples correlated with PSA levels, the number
of infiltrating macrophages and poor prognosis [12]. In a
small patient study, anti-androgens enhance the growth of
metastases, indicating that ADT-induced metastasis occurs
in human PCa [13]. The strongest human data in support of a
TNF-CCL2 paracrine loop comes from PCa patients assayed
within three months of initiation of ADT [16]. At this stage of
treatment, androgen signaling will be fully repressed (patient
serum PSA levels low). In this cohort, patients with increased
TNF and CCL2 fared worse, consistent with therapyinduced TNF/CCL2 enhancing metastasis even though ADT
inhibited the growth of primary tumors. As mentioned above,
this implies a divergence between AR signaling effects on
proliferation and the metastatic phenotype.

(localized) PCa tumors showed CCL2 levels correlated

data derives from the co-culture of a set of relevant cell
lines, many aspects of this signaling paradigm have been
confirmed in murine models. Specifically, our prior data

with Gleason score and tumor stage [48], analysis of
metastasized CRPC sample data sets in Oncomine
reveals reduced CCL2 (Figure 11). Specifically, in CRPC
patients (where AR signaling is likely reactivated, and
patient serum PSA levels are rising) CCL2 mRNA in the
metastases was clearly reduced. Similarly, metastases in
patients who were not given ADT also have decreased
CCL2 mRNA (Supplementary Figure S6). Since the
tumor cells have already metastasized and escaped
the primary tumor microenvironment, CCL2 may no
longer be necessary. That is, once metastatic seeding has
occurred, the role of CCL2 in monocyte differentiation
and tumor cell migration is diminished. Moreover,
the stromal tumor microenvironment that was present
in the primary tumor is unlikely to be replicated at the
site of the  metastatic lesion(s), which lack the cellular
interactions that we believe generate CCL2. Furthermore,
TNF is significantly elevated in the CRPC metastatic
samples (Figure 11), but not consistently elevated in nonCRPC samples. The comparisons of non-CRPC patient
samples include primary tumors, which have low versus
high Gleason scores (Supplementary Figure S7), as well
as primary versus metastasis from patients who did not
undergo ADT (Supplementary Figure S6). Taken together,
these latter datasets suggest that TNF induction is only
consistently seen in response to ADT therapy, rather than
as a consequence of tumor progression.
We therefore propose that CCL2 primarily acts via
a therapy-induced paracrine loop, such as the one we
document in cell culture models, at the site of the primary
tumor but not at the site(s) of metastases. Another way to
view this is that the process of metastasis interrupts the
paracrine loop (TNF®CCL2) by relocating tumor cells
away from the original tumor microenvironment. This
further suggests that therapies directed against CCL2 or
TNF might be effective only during a narrow window
of time; that is, only if administered in conjunction with
the initial course of androgen deprivation therapy given
to patients still possessing a primary tumor, prior to the
onset of CRPC and metastases. Thus, our mechanistic
observations may explain the recent failure of CCL2
directed monoclonal therapy in PCa [49] since these
trials were performed using anti-CCL2 as a single agent
and in post-ADT patients who had already developed
metastatic CRPC.

The C4-2 cell line was from Dr. Jer-Tsong Hsieh, UT
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. LNCaP, THP1,
WPMY-1, PTEN-P8 and PTEN-CaP8 cell lines were from
the American Type Culture Collection (Rockwell, MD,
USA). C4-2, WPMY-1, THP1 and LNCaP, were cultured
in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. For THP1, the media also contained
10 mM HEPES and 2 mM glutamine; LNCaP culture media
also contained 1 mM sodium pyruvate. PTEN-P8 and
PTEN-CaP8 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
Cells were cultured at a density of 1 × 105/ml and
supplemented with enzalutamide, DHT or etanercept as
indicated. For TNF treatment, cells were cultured at 4 ×
104/ml. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104/ml for C4-2/WPMY-1
co-cultures and 1 × 105/ml for C4-2/THP1 co-cultures. TNF
and CCL2 were quantitated with ELISA kits (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA, USA), per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Metastasis assays
Two in vitro transwell assays (migration, invasion)
were performed to assess metastatic phenotypes. For
migration assays, cells were serum starved for 24 h,
trypsinized if required, washed and resuspended in serumfree media. Approximately 1 × 105 cells were placed
in the upper chamber of a 24-transwell plate (Corning
Inc., Tewksbury, MA, USA). Matrigel coated chambers
(Biocoat, Corning, NY, USA) was added to wells used
for invasion assays. Conditioned medium was prepared
by diluting culture supernatants with an equal amount
of fresh media plus 5% FCS. For C4-2 cells, after 22
h incubation, chambers were fixed and stained with 1%
toluidine blue for manual counting of photomicrographs
under the microscope (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). For THP-1 cells, after 16 h incubation, media was
collected and cells counted by Coulter counter. Counts
were normalized to vehicle control.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
Cells were cultured at the same densities used for
the ELISA assays. Total RNA was extracted and reverse
transcribed using pdN15 with Superscript III reverse
transcription kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) to
generate single-strand cDNA. PCR was performed
using SYBR® Green qPCR Master Mix (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in a StepOnePlus instrument
(Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR
primers, spanning at least one intron, were: TNF-forward:
5′-CCTCTCTCTAATCAGCCCTCTG-3′; TNF-reverse:
5′-GAGGACCTGGGAGTA-GATGAG-3′; CCL2-forw­
