ABSTRACT
Our previous studies showed that anti-β2M monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have
strong and direct apoptotic effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, suggesting that
anti-β2M mAbs might be developed as a novel therapeutic agent. In this study, we
investigated the anti-MM effects of combination treatment with anti-β2M mAbs and
bortezomib (BTZ). Our results showed that anti-β2M mAbs enhanced BTZ-induced
apoptosis of MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Combination treatment could also
induce apoptosis of BTZ-resistant MM cells, and the enhanced effect depended on the
surface expression of β2M on MM cells. BTZ up-regulated the expression of autophagy
proteins, whereas combination with anti-β2M mAbs inhibited autophagy. Sequence
analysis of the promoter region of beclin 1 identified 3 putative NF-κB-binding sites
from –615 to –789 bp. BTZ treatment increased, whereas combination with anti-β2M
mAbs reduced, NF-κB transcription activities in MM cells, and combination treatment
inhibited NF-κB p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter. Furthermore, anti-β2M mAbs
and BTZ combination treatment had anti-MM activities in an established MM mouse
model. Thus, our studies provide new insight and support for the clinical development
of an anti-β2M mAb and BTZ combination treatment to overcome BTZ drug resistance
and improve MM patient survival.

death and survival are regulated by the crosstalk between
apoptosis and autophagy [6], and autophagy activation
inhibits apoptosis through reducing caspase cleavage [7,
8]. Recent studies have shown that autophagy activation
plays a role in chemotherapy drug resistance in patients
with cancer [9]. In particular, BTZ treatment activates
autophagy in tumor cells [10, 11]. BTZ-induced autophagy
is important in BTZ drug resistance in breast cancer,
suggesting that inhibiting autophagy may overcome BTZinduced drug resistance [9].
Targeted immunotherapy with monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) is an effective and safe cancer
treatment. Recent efforts have identified potential
therapeutic mAbs by defining alternative or novel MM

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma
cell neoplasm that utilizes the bone marrow (BM)
microenvironment for survival and proliferation [1–3].
Current MM therapies are rarely curative, and relapse
is common. Such failure implies that therapy-resistant,
MM-initiating cells exist and that new therapeutics must
be developed to target and eradicate these chemoresistant
MM cells.
Bortezomib (BTZ) is a proteasome inhibitor used
worldwide to treat MM and mantle cell lymphoma [4].
However, adverse effects and drug resistance are emerging
as great challenges for its extended application [5]. Cell

[14], HM1.24 [15, 16], CD74 [17], CD47 [18], TRAIL-R1
[19], CS1 [20], PD-1 [21], as well as by conjugating mAbs
with classic or novel drugs to specifically kill MM cells,
i.e., CD56-maytansinoid (DM1) [22], CD138-DM1/DM4
[23]. Because most of these antibodies have little activity
clinically in myeloma, the development of mAbs with
improved cytotoxicity, targeting new and known MMassociated antigens, continues to be an active research
area.
β2-microglobulin (β2M) is a part of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule
[24]. We recently demonstrated that human β2M is a
potential target for MM treatment [25, 26]. Our previous
studies showed that anti-β2M mAbs have strong and
direct apoptotic effects on MM and other hematological
malignancies, with less toxicity to normal tissues and
cells [25, 27], suggesting that anti-β2M mAbs might be
a novel therapeutic agent for MM. Furthermore, others
have reported similar results using an anti-MHC class-1
single-chain Fv diabody or anti-β2M antibodies to induce
apoptosis in human MM [28] and other cancers [29, 30].
Here, we examined the anti-MM effects of
combination treatment with anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ.
Combination treatment inhibited BTZ-induced autophagy
and increased MM cell apoptosis to overcome BTZ
resistance. These results support the clinical development
of anti-β2M mAb and BTZ combination treatment to
improve MM patient outcomes.

combination treatment induced enhanced apoptosis by
1.5-fold in all examined MM cell lines (Figure 1E; P <
0.01). In line with these results, after 24-hour treatment,
purified primary CD138+ MM cells isolated from 3
patients with MM were more sensitive to the combination
treatment than BTZ treatment alone. Two other patients
with relapse who had received BTZ were considered as
BTZ-resistant. In these MM patient cells, BTZ treatment
alone was ineffective whereas combination with anti-β2M
mAbs increased apoptosis (Figure 1F, patients 4 and 5).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that anti-β2M
mAbs combined with BTZ is more effective against MM
cells than BTZ treatment alone.
The Chou-Talalay combination index (CI) offers
quantitative definitions for additive effect (CI = 1),
synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI > 1) in drug
combinations. We applied the CI-isobol equation to study
drug interactions between BTZ and anti-β2M mAbs. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S1, combining BTZ and
anti-β2M mAb has a synergistic effect (CI < 1) at a low
concentration (fraction affected (fa) < 0.45). Therefore,
we used low concentrations of BTZ (5 nM) and anti-β2M
mAbs (10 μg/mL) in the following experiments.

The combination of anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ
overcomes BTZ resistance
To investigate whether combining anti-β2M mAbs
and BTZ enhances the anti-MM effects of BTZ in BTZresistant MM cells, we used BTZ-sensitive (KAS-6.wt and
OPM-2.wt) and BTZ-resistant (KAS-6.BR and OPM-2.
BR) MM cells [31]. First, we confirmed cell sensitivity
to BTZ treatment, observing that BTZ treatment induced
apoptosis of BTZ-sensitive cells in a dose-dependent
manner, but did not induce apoptosis of BTZ-resistant cells
(Figure 2A and 2C; P < 0.01). Next, we analyzed apoptosis
of BTZ-sensitive and BTZ-resistant MM cells treated with
BTZ or anti-β2M mAbs, alone or in combination. After
24-hour treatment, BTZ was effective in BTZ-sensitive
cells but not in BTZ-resistant cells, whereas combining
BTZ with anti-β2M mAbs induced apoptosis in both
BTZ-sensitive and BTZ-resistant cells, and was more
efficacious than BTZ treatment alone (Figure 2B and 2D;
P < 0.01). These results indicate that combining anti-β2M
mAbs with BTZ overcomes BTZ resistance in MM.

RESULTS
Anti-β2M mAbs enhance the effects of BTZ on
MM cell apoptosis
To investigate the combination effects of anti-β2M
mAbs and BTZ, MM cells were cultured in medium with
different concentrations of BTZ (0 nM to 40 nM) alone
or in combination with anti-β2M mAbs (10 μg/mL) for
24 hours. Annexin-V binding assay showed that BTZ at
lower concentrations (5 nM and 10 nM) in combination
with the mAbs significantly enhanced apoptosis of ARP-1
(Figure 1A) and MM.1S (Figure 1B) cells. Treatment with
high concentrations of BTZ (20 nM and 40 nM) alone had
strong anti-MM effects, but combination with the mAbs
had no synergistic effects (Figure 1A and 1B; P < 0.01).
Next, MM cells were cultured with various anti-β2M mAb
concentrations (0 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL), either alone or in
combination with a low (5 nM) BTZ concentration for
24 hours. Combination treatment significantly enhanced
apoptosis of ARP-1 (Figure 1C) and MM.1S (Figure 1D)
cells in an anti-β2M mAb dose-dependent manner (P <
0.01, compared with mAb treatment alone). Combination
of anti-β2M mAbs (10 μg/mL) and BTZ (5 nM) was further
evaluated in the MM cell lines ARK, ARP-1, MM.1S, and
U266 in a 24-hour treatment. Compared to BTZ alone,

Effects of combination treatment depends on
MM cell β2M expression
To evaluate the significance of MM cell β2M expression
in anti-β2M mAb and BTZ combination treatment-induced
MM apoptosis, we used β2M short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)lentiviral or β2M open reading frame (ORF)-lentiviral
systems to knockdown or overexpress β2M, respectively,
in MM cells. β2M expression was evaluated by Western
blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction

flow cytometry. Significant reductions or increases in β2M
protein (Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B) and mRNA
(Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D) were observed in β2M
shRNA- or β2M ORF-expressing ARP-1 and MM.1S cells
compared with non-specific shRNA or control vector cells
(P < 0.01). In addition, β2M shRNA-expressing ARP-1 cells
secreted significantly less soluble β2M whereas β2M ORFexpressing ARP-1 cells secreted more compared with control
cells (Supplementary Figure S2E; P < 0.01). Flow cytometry
analysis showed a 70% reduction inβ2M shRNA-ARP-1
cells whereas β2M ORF-ARP-1 cells had a 2-fold increase
in surface expression of β2M (Supplementary Figure S2F)
and HLA-ABC (Supplementary Figure S2G) compared with
control cells (P < 0.01).
Next, the effects of anti-β2M mAb or BTZ treatment,
singly or in combination, on MM cell apoptosis were
examined in β2M-knockdown and β2M-overexpressing
MM cells. After 24-hour treatment, anti-β2M mAb
treatment alone induced apoptosis of control cells
and enhanced apoptosis ofβ2M-overexpressing cells,
but reduced apoptosis in β2M-knockdown cells; BTZ
treatment alone induced apoptosis in all tested cells
(Figure 3). Combination treatment did not enhance apo­
ptosis in β2M-knockdown cells (Figure 3A and 3C) but
did in β2M-overexpressing cells (Figure 3B and 3D), as

compared with BTZ treated-only cells (P < 0.01). These
results indicate that the enhanced effects of combination
treatment depend on MM cell β2M expression.

Combination of anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ
reduces BTZ-induced autophagy
To further determine the enhanced effects of
combination treatment on MM cell apoptosis, we
evaluated caspase cascades in MM cells treated for 24
hours. In ARP-1 and MM.1S cells, BTZ or anti-β2M mAb
treatment alone resulted in an accumulation of cleaved
caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP, and the combination
treatment enhanced the caspase cleavage (Figure 4A).
These findings were in line with the annexin-V binding
assay results (Figure 1) and suggest that anti-β2M mAbs
plus BTZ enhances caspase activation in MM cells.
Cell death and survival are regulated by the crosstalk
between apoptosis and autophagy [32]. Recent studies
have shown that autophagy activation plays a role in BTZ
drug resistance in patients with cancer [11]. We therefore
determined the effects of 24-hour anti-β2M mAb and BTZ
combination treatment on autophagy activation. Treatment
with BTZ alone up-regulated the expression of autophagy
proteins LAMP-1, Beclin 1, and LC3B, whereas treatment
with anti-β2M mAbs alone or in combination with BTZ

wt, and OPM2.BR cells were examined. As shown in
Figure 4C, autophagy protein expression was higher in
BTZ-resistant cell lines compared with BTZ-sensitive cell
lines. BTZ treatment alone up-regulated the expression
of LAMP-1, Beclin 1, and LC3B whereas anti-β2M mAb
treatment alone or combined with BZT down-regulated
the expression in both BTZ-resistant and -sensitive cell
lines. These results indicated that combining anti-β2M
mAbs and BTZ overcomes BTZ-induced autophagy in
both BTZ-resistant and -sensitive MM cells.
To determine which autophagy proteins mediate
BTZ resistance, we rescued LAMP-1, Beclin 1, and LC3B

containing human LAMP1, Beclin-1, or LC3B ORFs,
respectively. After 24-hour treatment, rescuing Beclin 1, but
not LC3B or LAMP-1, reduced apoptosis in ARP-1 cells
treated with anti-β2M mAbs alone or in combination with
BTZ (Figure 4D), indicating that Beclin 1 is responsible for
the anti-β2M mAb-induced inhibition of autophagy.

Combination treatment down-regulates
autophagy by inhibiting BTZ-activated
NF-κB p65 signaling
Constitutive NF-κB activity in cancer cells can
induce BTZ resistance [33, 34]. Therefore, we wondered
whether anti-β2M mAbs inhibited BTZ-induced autophagy
by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. After 24-hour treatment,

cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions of ARP-1 and
MM.1S cells were extracted and detected by Western
blotting. As shown in Figure 5A, BTZ treatment alone
induced the translocation of NF-κB p65 into nuclei,
whereas anti-β2M mAb treatment alone or in combination
with BTZ had no such effect. In addition, BTZ treatment
alone increased the phosphorylation levels of p65 and
IκB-α in ARP-1, MM.1S, OPM-2.wt, and OPM-2.BR cells
after 24-hour treatment, whereas anti-β2M mAb treatment
alone or in combination with BTZ reduced the levels of
phosphorylated p65 and IκB-α (Figure 5B). These results
indicate that BTZ alone activates NF-κB signaling,
whereas anti-β2M mAb and BTZ combination treatment
reduces the signaling.

assay verified that 24-hour treatment with BTZ treatment
alone up-regulated p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter
in ARP-1 cells, but anti-β2M mAb treatment alone or in
combination with BTZ reduced the binding (Figure 5D). To
further confirm that BTZ induced p65 binding to the beclin
1 promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
was performed. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3,
after 24-hour treatment, potential #2 probe could bind to
ARP-1 nuclear proteins, but potential #1 and potential #3
probes could not. Further analysis of the potential #2 probe
confirmed an intense band in the BTZ treatment group,
but only faint bands in the anti-β2M mAb and combination
treatment groups (Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure S3),
indicating that BTZ treatment enhanced protein binding to
the beclin 1 promoter but anti-β2M mAbs or combination
treatment inhibited the binding. For DNA competition
experiments, the inducible band could be shifted off
completely by unlabeled potential #2 probe, but not by
unlabeled mutant potential #2 probe (Figure 5E). After

Anti-β2M mAbs enhance the anti-MM effects of

BTZ treatment, p65 antibody supershifted the identified
band, indicating that BTZ presence leads to p65 binding
of the beclin 1 promoter (Figure 5F). These results indicate
that anti-β2M mAbs reduce BTZ-induced autophagy by
inhibiting NF-κB p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter.
In addition, rescuing p65 by lentiviral infection
of human p65 ORF treated with anti-β2M mAbs alone
or combined with BTZ for 24 hours reduced apoptosis,
whereas knocking down p65 by lentiviral infection with
human p65 shRNA increased apoptosis of ARP-1 cells
(Figure 5G). Taken together, these results indicate that
anti-β2M mAbs enhanced BTZ treatment efficacy via an
NF-κB–Beclin 1 signaling pathway.

[25, 35]. Although treatment with anti-β2M mAbs or BTZ
reduced tumor volume (P < 0.05, versus control mice),
combination treatment was more efficacious than BTZ alone

combination treatment showed additive effects on induction
of MM cell apoptosis compared with treatment with BTZ
alone (Figure 6E). Immunohistochemistry in ARP-1 tumorbearing mice revealed that cells positive for Ki67 decreased
after combination treatment, and cells positive for cleaved
caspase 3 increased after combination treatment, compared
with BTZ treatment alone (Figure 6E). These data indicate
that combination of anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ enhances

drugs, such as BTZ, usually induces drug resistance, and quick
relapse is common [38, 39]. mAbs are emerging as a major
new treatment that confers great benefits [40]. In this study,
we determined that the combination of anti-β2M mAbs and
BTZ was more effective against MM than either agent alone.
More importantly, we found that anti-β2M mAbs overcome
BTZ resistance by inhibiting BTZ-induced autophagy.
Anti-β2M mAbs enhanced the anti-MM effects of
BTZ in a panel of established human MM cell lines and
primary MM cells from patients. These findings indicate
the potential of anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ combination
treatment as a therapeutic strategy against MM.
Moreover, anti-β2M mAbs re-sensitized BTZ-resistant
MM cells to BTZ treatment, and the enhanced effects of
the combination treatment correlated with the expression
of surface β2M on MM cells. Therefore, combination
treatment with anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ has the potential
to impact a larger and heterogeneous patient population
with β2M-expression, and to be effective in patients with
relapse or who develop tumors resistant to conventional
treatment with BTZ.
Mechanistic studies showed that the combination
of anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ resulted in an accumulation

of cleaved caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP, and inhibition
of the autophagy proteins LAMP-1, Beclin 1, and LC3B.
Treatment with a low concentration of BTZ had only
a minor effect on caspase cleavage but could induce
autophagy. Notably, we found that anti-β2M mAbs inhibited
BTZ-induced autophagy in a dose-dependent manner (data
not shown). Thus, the combination of anti-β2M mAbs and
BTZ may provide an approach to overcome BTZ drug
resistance through the inhibition of BTZ-induced autophagy.
Recent research demonstrated that BTZ can induce
canonical NF-κB activation by down-regulating constitutive
IκB-α expression in MM cells [41]. Other studies found that
BTZ treatment of primary effusion lymphoma cells failed
to inhibit NF-κB activation [42]. In line with these reports,
our data showed that BTZ activated NF-κB transcription
activity by increasing NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and
p65 phosphorylation in MM cells. The combination of antiβ2M mAbs and BTZ significantly reduced both the NF-κB
p65 nuclear translocation and p65 phosphorylation. Other
groups have reported novel NF-κB p65 consensus sites in
the beclin 1 promoter and demonstrated that NF-κB p65

positively modulated canonical autophagy in various human
tumor cell lines [43]. Our ChIP and EMSA assays verified
that anti-β2M mAb treatment inhibited BTZ-induced NF-κB
p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter.
The enhanced anti-MM effect of the combination
therapy was also found in vivo. Combination treatment
with anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ inhibited tumor growth and
serum M-protein level compared with either agent alone.
These results underscore a potential clinical development
strategy by combining anti-β2M mAbs and BTZ to treat
MM patients, which could lower the doses of BTZ and
anti-β2M mAbs needed while enhancing their anti-tumor
effects, and more importantly, reduce BTZ- and anti-β2M
mAb-induced toxicity.
As shown in our schematic diagram of signaling
pathways (Supplementary Figure S4), BTZ induces
caspase cleavage and apoptosis of MM cells, resulting
in drug sensitivity to BTZ treatment. However, BTZ
could also enhance beclin 1 transcription by increasing
NF-κB p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter, leading to
autophagy activation. Activated autophagy inhibits MM

resistance to BTZ treatment (Supplementary Figure S4A).
When BTZ is combined with anti-β2M mAbs, NF-κB p65
transcription activities and BTZ-induced autophagy are
inhibited, while caspase cleavage and MM cell apoptosis
are increased, resulting in re-sensitization of MM cells to
BTZ treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B). Thus, our
study strongly suggests that anti-β2M mAbs can overcome
BTZ drug resistance in patients.
In conclusion, we for the first time demonstrate
that anti-β2M mAbs prevent BTZ drug resistance and
enhance BTZ anti-MM efficacy by reducing autophagy
protein expression via NF-κB signaling, which provides
a rationale for combining these drugs to improve patient
outcomes in MM. Thus, our studies provide new insight
for the clinical development of anti-β2M mAbs to
overcome chemotherapy drug resistance and improve MM
patient survival.

MM cell cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions
were extracted using NE-PER extraction reagents
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce
Biotechnology). Nuclear protein extracts were used for
EMSA. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were
used for detecting NF-κB p65 by Western blotting. PARP
or GAPDH served as a nuclear or cytoplasmic internal
control, respectively.

Western blotting

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blotting was conducted as previously
described [25]. Mouse anti-β2M mAbs (Santa Cruz
Biotech) were used to detect β2M protein. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against cleaved caspase 9, cleaved
caspase 3, cleaved PARP, LAMP-1, Beclin 1, LC3B, nonphosphorylated p65, phosphorylated p65, phosphorylated
IκB-α, GAPDH, PARP, and β-actin were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology.

Reagents, MM cell lines, and primary MM cells

qPCR

Anti-β2M mAbs (clone D1) were generated as
previously described [25]. Mouse IgG1 (BioLegend) was
used as an isotype control. BTZ (PS-341; Millennium)
was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM as a stock solution.
Human ARP-1 and ARK cells were established at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences from
BM aspirates of patients with MM [44], MM.1S was
kindly provided by Dr. Steven Rosen of Northwestern
University (Chicago, IL), and U266 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The BTZ-sensitive (wild-type, wt) and BTZ-resistant
(BR) MM cell lines KAS-6.wt, KAS-6.BR, OPM-2.
wt, and OPM-2.BR were generated by Dr. Robert Z.
Orlowski as previously described [31]. Primary CD138+
MM cells were isolated from BM aspirates of MM
patients according to approved IRB protocols of The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and
Cleveland Clinic. All cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed
using a SuperScript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase
PCR kit; 1 μL of the final cDNA was used for qPCR
amplification with SYBRGreen using a StepOnePlus realtime PCR system (Applied Biosciences). The primers for
amplification were: β2M-F 5′-AAT TGA AAA AGT GGA
GCA TTC AGA-3′; β2M-R 5′-GGC TGT GAC AAA GTC
ACA TGG TT-3′; GAPDH-F 5′-CAC TCC TCC ACC
TTT GAC G-3′; and GAPDH-R 5′-ACC ACC CTG TTG
CTG TAG C-3′. Gene expression levels were normalized
to GAPDH levels.

Analysis of surface β2M and HLA-ABC and cell
apoptosis by flow cytometry
APC-conjugated mAbs against human β2M, HLAABC, and isotype control were obtained from BioLegend.
An apoptosis assay was performed as previously described
[25]. FITC-labeled annexin-V antibody and propidium
iodide (PI) were purchased from Life Technologies. Data
were acquired with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD
Biosciences).

Lentiviral infection of MM cells with shRNA
and ORF expression clone transfection
MM cells were infected with lentivirus containing
human β2M or p65 shRNAs or lentivirus containing
human β2M, LAMP1, Beclin-1, LC3B, or p65 ORFs
(Genecopoeia) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
to knockdown or overexpress specific gene, respectively.
Non-specific shRNA or control vector was used as
controls. Stable cell line screening was performed with
800 μg/mL neomycin (Sigma) for 4 weeks, and positive
cells were selected.

ELISA
Cell culture supernatants were collected, and
secreted β2M was quantified with a human β2M Quantikine
IVD ELISA Kit (R&D Systems). Serum M-protein levels
were measured in SCID mice injected with ARP-1 by
using the Human Kappa ELISA Kit or MM.1S cells using
the Human Lambda ELISA Kit (Bethyl Laboratories).

ChIP assay

In situ apoptosis assay and immunohistochemistry

ChIP assay was performed with a ChIP assay
kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Chromatin was extracted from ARP-1 cells.
Anti-NF-κB p65 antibody and isotype control (Cell
Signaling Technology) were used for the chromatin
immunoprecipitation. The precipitated DNA was analyzed
by qPCR with the following primer sets for the region
surrounding the NF-κB binding sites at the beclin 1
promoter: F 5′-AGA CCA GCC TGG CCA AAA TGG
T-3′ and R 5′-TGA GAT GGA GTT TCC TTC TGT CG3′. Values were subtracted from control IgG values and
normalized to corresponding input control.

In situ tumor cell apoptosis was determined by
using a TUNEL assay kit (Boehringer–Mannheim).
Immunohistochemistry was conducted as previously
described [46]. Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 expression
were detected using specific antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology). Sectioned tumor tissue was embedded
in paraffin. Three slides from each treatment group
were evaluated. Six fields were arbitrarily selected for
examination, using a defined rectangular field area at
× 200 magnification, and positive staining cells were
counted in each field.

Statistical analysis

EMSA

The Student’s t-test was used to compare various
experimental groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, the
values provided are means and standard deviations (SD).

Probes were labeled at the 3’ end with
biotin (Biotin 3’ End DNA Labeling Kit; Pierce
Biotechnology), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Oligonucleotides used as probe or competitor were
synthesized as: potential #1, 5′-AAA TGG TTA AAT
CCC GTC TCT A-3′; potential #2, 5′-GGG TAG GAA
AAT CGC TTG ACC C-3′; potential #2 mutant, 5′-GGG
TAG CAA AAT CCC TTG ACC C-3′; potential #3, 5′GAC AGA AGG AAA CTC CAT CTC A-3′. EMSA was
performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA
Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The DNA-protein complexes
were separated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5%
Tris-borate buffer. For DNA competition experiments, a
100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was
added before incubation. For supershift experiments, 2 μL
of anti-NF-′B p65 antibody or isotype control was added
to the completed binding reaction mixture [45].

In vivo tumor xenograft mouse models
Six-week-old male SCID mice (Jackson
Laboratory) were injected subcutaneously in the right
flank with 1 × 106 ARP-1 or MM.1S cells. At 3 to 4
weeks later when palpable tumors (5 mm in diameter)
developed, mice (n = 4 per group) were intraperitoneally
injected with BTZ (0.1 mg/kg), subcutaneously injected
around tumors with anti-β2M mAbs (0.6 mg/kg), either
singly or in combination every 3 days for 3 weeks.
Control mice were injected with equal amounts of mouse
IgG1 or DMSO. Tumors were measured every 3 days
with calipers, and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated
as (width2 × length)/2. Mice were humanely sacrificed
when moribund or when subcutaneous tumors reached
15 mm in diameter. All mice were maintained in facilities
accredited by the American Association of Laboratory
Animal Care, and the studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and
Cleveland Clinic.
