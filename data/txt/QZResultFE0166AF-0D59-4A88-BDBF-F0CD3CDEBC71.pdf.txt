Abstract
Defects in apoptosis are not only a hallmark of cancer
initiation and progression but can also underlie the development of chemoresistance. How the tightly regulated cascade
of protein-protein interactions between members of three
competing protein families regulating the apoptotic cascade
is subverted in tumor cells is incompletely understood. Here,
we show that KLF6-SV1, whose overexpression is associated
with poor survival in several different cancers and is an alternatively spliced isoform of the Krüppel-like tumor suppressor
KLF6, is a critical prosurvival/antiapoptotic protein. KLF6SV1 binds the proapoptotic BH3-only protein NOXA, which
results in their mutual HDM2-dependent degradation. In turn,
this increases the intracellular concentration of the prosurvival binding partner of NOXA, Mcl-1, and effectively blocks
apoptosis. In an ovarian cancer model, systemically delivered
small interfering RNA against KLF6-SV1 induces spontaneous
apoptosis of tumor cells, decreases tumor burden, and restores cisplatin sensitivity in vivo. Moreover, i.p. delivery of
siKLF6-SV1 RNA halts ovarian tumor progression and improves
median and overall survival (progression-free for >15 months;
P < 0.0002) in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, KLF6SV1 represents a novel regulator of protein interactions in
the apoptotic cascade and a therapeutically targetable control point. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4733–41]

Introduction
Apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved program in diverse
biological systems (1) and an important mediator of the cytotoxic
action of chemotherapeutic agents (2). The developmental and
physiologic cues that trigger programmed cell death are controlled
by specific competing protein-protein interactions between members of three protein families, two acting to promote cell death
and the third to block this effect (3). So critical is this control that
defects in apoptosis result in several pathologic disorders and are
considered a hallmark of cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis (4). Overcoming these defects and exploiting selective
interactions within the apoptotic pathway therefore represent
an appealing therapeutic opportunity (5). For example, mimetics

targeting the proapoptotic, BH3-only protein family, which directly
respond to cytotoxic stresses, would represent a desirable strategy
owing to the ability of the family members to act independently of
the p53 status of a tumor cell (6, 7), specificity of Bcl-2 family
member interaction (8), restricted activity in a particular tumor type
(9), and potential as an adjuvant treatment in conventional chemotherapy (10).
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common form of cancer in
women in the United States, and with an estimated 15,520 deaths
from among 21,650 newly diagnosed cases, it is the most lethal of
all gynecologic cancers (11). Most patients present with advancedstage disease, and although initially responsive to platinum-based
chemotherapy, the majority will succumb to recurrence and
chemoresistance (12). Recently, decreased levels of the tumor
suppressor KLF6 and increased levels of its alternatively spliced
isoform KLF6-SV1 have been linked to ovarian cancer progression
and chemoresistance (13, 14). Intriguingly, although its function is
unknown, KLF6-SV1 was originally identified and its overexpression is linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with
an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer (15–18). Although
present in both normal and cancerous cells, expression of this cytoplasmic isoform is significantly up-regulated in multiple cancers
(13, 15, 17, 19) and its overexpression is associated with decreased
survival in prostate and lung cancers (20, 21).
Given the known overexpression of KLF6-SV1 in ovarian tumors
and the critical limitations associated with ovarian cancer treatment and recurrence, we directly investigated its function and
potential therapeutic value. Here, we show that systemic administration of chemically modified KLF6-SV1 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) molecules results in long-term silencing in tumor cells,
restores cisplatin sensitivity to increase apoptosis, and in a dosedependent manner provides long-term survival in mice harboring
disseminated i.p. ovarian cancer. In accord with previous hypotheses suggesting the potential therapeutic opportunity in targeting
BH3-only family members, we show that KLF6-SV1 is a prosurvival/
antiapoptotic molecule that directly interacts with and regulates
NOXA, targeting them both for HDM2-mediated degradation.

Materials and Methods
Animal models. For the i.p. model of ovarian cancer dissemination, 6- to
8-wk-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice were injected with 1  107 SKOV3-Luc
cells (a kind gift from Achim Aigner, Philipps-University School of Medicine,
Marburg, Germany) and whole-body bioluminescence was measured
biweekly until mice were euthanized at day 50 (Fig. 1) or until the mice
became moribund and displayed features of distress (Fig. 2). On sacrificing
the mice, tumors as well as any ascitic fluid were harvested. All animal work
and protocols were approved by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

In vivo bioluminescent imaging. Bioluminescent imaging was
performed with an IVIS-200 Imaging System (Xenogen). Ten to 15 min
before in vivo imaging, animals received the substrate D-luciferin (Biosynth)
at 150 mg/kg in PBS by i.p. injection and were anesthetized using 1% to 3%
isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories). Imaging times ranged from 30 s to 20 min
depending on the intensity of tumor nodules. The light emitted from the
abdominal area of each mouse was quantified as photon/second using the
Living Image software (Xenogen).
Flow cytometry. Following treatment with siNTC, siSV1, or cisplatin,
cells were collected by trypsinization (Life Technologies) and centrifuged at
1,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 AL PBS, fixed in
70% ethanol, and then stored at 4jC overnight before analysis. Fixed cells
were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 1 mL PBS
containing 5 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Boehringer Mannheim) and 50 AL of
10 mg/mL RNase (Roche). Cells were analyzed on FACSort flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) at 488-nm absorbance using CellQuest software.
Propidium iodide staining was used for measuring the distribution of cells
within the cell cycle. Sub-G1 peaks on DNA histograms from hypodiploid
DNA represent dead cells, which may indicate apoptosis but may also
contain some necrotic cells.
Western blot analysis. Cell extracts for Western blotting were harvested
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
standard protocol). Tumor tissue extracts were harvested and prepared in
the T-PER reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (50 Ag) as determined
by the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein quantification assay were

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

loaded and separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Western blotting was performed using antibodies for actin and KLF6 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-3 and PUMA (Cell Signaling), caspase-8 and
NOXA (Calbiochem), Flag M2 (Sigma), V5 (Invitrogen), and BAX (Upstate).
siRNA-mediated inhibition. For the in vitro studies, all cell lines were
seeded in 12-well culture plates at 60% to 70% confluence. The next day,
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells with siSTABLEA4 siSV1 (5¶-CAGGGAAGGAGAAAAGCCUUU) or siNTC (inverted hgalactosidase sequence; 5¶-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU) at a final siRNA
concentration of 100 nmol/L. For the in vivo study, Accell (Dharmacon)
chemically synthesized siRNAs to either siSV1 (5¶-CAGGGAAGGAGAAAAGCCUUU) or siNTC (inverted h-galactosidase sequence; 5¶-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU) were injected i.p. at prespecified time points and
concentrations as outlined in Figs. 1 and 2.
Statistical analyses. We conducted statistical analysis by ANOVA with
the Student’s t test. A P value of V0.05 was considered significant. KaplanMeier survival curves and log-rank test were performed using GraphPad
Prism. To confirm that all our treatment studies obtained sufficient power,
we performed post hoc power analysis using G*Power software.

Results
In vivo inhibition of KLF6-SV1 prolongs survival. To
investigate the potential in vivo antitumor effects of systemically
delivered KLF6-SV1 siRNA, we used a well-characterized model

of disseminated ovarian cancer (22) coupled with a novel chemically modified siRNA (Accell). SKOV3 cells stably expressing
luciferase (SKOV3-Luc) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity
of nude mice and imaged after 48 hours to confirm establishment
of disseminated tumors. Three distinct sets of experiments were
defined. As a test of the efficacy and stability of the siRNA, we
first administered by peritoneal injection a relatively low dose of
siRNA (3 mg/kg) targeted against either a control (siNTC) or KLF6SV1 (siSV1) every third day for a total of six doses (Fig. 1A). All
mice were sacrificed 1 month following the last dose (day 50) and
i.p. tumor nodules were removed for analysis. siSV1 inhibition
remained highly effective (f80% knockdown) and specific for
KLF6-SV1 even 30 days following the last treatment both on the
RNA and protein level (Fig. 1A). Even at this low dose (3 mg/kg)

of siSV1, tumor growth was decreased f2.5-fold in siSV1 mice
(Fig. 1B–D).
Given that a recent study has reported that nonspecific
stimulation of the TLR3 pathway may be an unintended
consequence of siRNA dosing, we explored whether the effect of
siSV1 on tumor burden was not a result of a similar cytokine
induction (23). No significant differences in serum levels of IFNg,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, or interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-4,
IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 were noted between control and treated
mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, and to confirm uptake
of siRNA into tumors, we also administered two doses of Cy3labeled siSV1 molecules (10 mg/kg) via the i.p. route in parallel
experiments. All disseminated tumors revealed strong uptake
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

Ovarian cancer is clinically managed by surgical debulking in
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (24). Therefore,
we next investigated if siSV1 combined with cisplatin would more
effectively inhibit tumor growth and increase survival when compared against cisplatin alone (Fig. 2A). Mice were treated with
either cisplatin (5 mg/kg) or cisplatin (5 mg/kg) combined with
siNTC (3 mg/kg) or siSV1 (3 mg/kg) and then monitored for
disease progression (Fig. 2A). Mice receiving siSV1 plus cisplatin
had the greatest antitumor benefits. Mice receiving cisplatin alone
or siNTC plus cisplatin had tumor growth rates that were at least
five times greater (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the median survival of siSV1
plus cisplatin–treated mice (86 days) was increased >35% compared with mice treated with either siNTC plus cisplatin (63 days)
or cisplatin alone (62 days; P < 0.018) and more than doubled when
compared with PBS controls (42 days; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2C). Beyond
this, the addition of siSV1 to cisplatin significantly increased overall
survival by f50% when compared with cisplatin alone (116 versus
79 days) or cisplatin with siNTC (74 days) and was twice that of
PBS-treated mice (55 days; P < 0.02; Fig. 2C).
Finally, we tested the effectiveness of siSV1 as a single agent with
survival as the final outcome. Median and overall survival were
markedly enhanced and directly dose dependent (Fig. 2D). Mice were
treated 1 week after tumor cell implantation with escalating i.p.
doses (3, 10, or 20 mg/kg) of either siSV1 or siNTC every 3 days for a
total of six treatments. The group of mice treated with 20 mg/kg
siSV1 showed the most dramatic effects in both median and overall
survival: median survival was tripled (114 versus 311 days) and overall survival was doubled [225 versus 456 days; P = 0.0002; 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 3.2–39.4]. Two mice achieved complete
remission (Fig. 2D). Mice treated with 10 mg/kg siSV1 also showed
significant median (110 versus 136 days) and overall survival
differences (P = 0.03; 95% CI, 1.1–10.2; Fig. 2D). Although there were
significant survival differences in the groups treated with siSV1,
there were some mice that overcame siSV1 treatment and we are
examining modes of acquired resistance in this subset.
KLF6-SV1 inhibition induces apoptosis and restores chemosensitivity. Given that the antitumor effect of siSV1 was amplified
in the presence of cisplatin (Fig. 2B and C), we examined the effect
of cisplatin on endogenous KLF6-SV1 expression levels in cisplatinsensitive (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant (A2780CP) isogenic tumor
cell lines. Over the range of cisplatin tested (0–50 Amol/L), A2780
cells were susceptible to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and there
was a concomitant decrease in KLF6-SV1 protein levels (Fig. 3A).
In contrast, the A2780CP-resistant cell line did not undergo
apoptosis at either the 10 or 20 Amol/L dosing of cisplatin and
KLF6-SV1 protein levels, which were much greater than in the
A2780 line, were unaffected. Only at 50 Amol/L cisplatin did the
A2780CP cells undergo apoptosis. At this dosage level, KLF6-SV1
protein was degraded (Fig. 3A).
Based on these findings that KLF6-SV1 overexpression may
confer resistance to cisplatin and the fact that KLF6-SV1 levels are
increased in several late-stage cancers (13, 15, 19), we explored the
possibility that the link of KLF6-SV1 to tumorigenesis, progression,
and chemoresistance may be through apoptosis. Therefore, we
examined the effect of KLF6-SV1 inhibition on tumor cell death
both in the presence and absence of cisplatin. KLF6-SV1 inhibition
alone induced spontaneous apoptosis to the same level as cisplatin
alone (f17.0%). When inhibited in combination with cisplatin
treatment, the degree of apoptosis more than doubled (f44.2%;
Fig. 3B). Isobologram analysis revealed that the effects of the two
drugs on cell death were additive, not synergistic, in this model

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Intriguingly, this effect increased over
time. At 120 hours, nearly three times as many cells (45%) treated
with siSV1 plus cisplatin had apoptosed compared with controls
(16%; Fig. 3C). Unlike cisplatin, however, siSV1 activity seemed
cancer cell specific. Cell death was not induced in the noncancerous fibroblast cell line 293T (Fig. 3D) but present in all cancer cell
lines tested, including ovarian [SKOV3 (Fig. 3), A2780 (Supplementary Fig. S5), and 53S (Supplementary Fig. S4A)], lung (A549;
ref. 21), prostate (PC3, PC3-M, LNCaP, and DU145; ref. 20), colon
(HCT116; Supplementary Fig. S4A), and breast (MDA-435; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
KLF6-SV1 inhibition activates both extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic cascades. To confirm the cell cycle analysis and determine whether the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway of the apoptotic
cascade was activated, we analyzed the activity of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. KLF6-SV1 inhibition resulted in a significant
increase in the amount of all active caspases (Fig. 4A). In addition,
the combination of siSV1 and cisplatin resulted in the greatest
degree of caspase activation (Fig. 4A). In all cases, both caspase8 (extrinsic marker) and caspase-9 (intrinsic marker) were
activated by siSV1, implying that both pathways may be activated
(Fig. 4A). SKOV3 cells were then cotreated with siSV1 and either a
broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), which blocks
caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9; a caspase-8–specific inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK); or a caspase-9–specific
inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK). All inhibitors repressed apoptosis
induced by siSV1 (Fig. 4B). Blocking with the pan-caspase inhibitor
abolished siSV1-dependent apoptosis (P = 0.01). Interestingly,
specifically inhibiting caspase-8 or caspase-9 only blunted cell
death by f50% (P = 0.03; Fig. 4B). Collectively, these results suggest that multiple caspases are involved in siSV1-triggered apoptosis and that both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways may be
contributing to its function.
KLF6-SV1–mediated effects on apoptosis are NOXA dependent but p53 independent. A hallmark of both tumorigenesis and
chemoresistance is the selection and outgrowth of cells resistant to
apoptosis (4). We therefore compared expression levels of several
apoptotic-associated genes following KLF6-SV1 inhibition, including
members of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), BH3-only
proteins (PUMA, Bad, NOXA), and the proapoptotic protein BAX.
NOXA, which is induced by p53-dependent or p53-independent
apoptotic stimuli (6, 25, 26), was the most up-regulated: f4-fold
following siSV1 treatment and f2-fold with cisplatin treatment.
When siSV1 and cisplatin were combined, NOXA mRNA was
induced f7-fold (Fig. 4C). These effects on NOXA in cultured cells
were also present in tumors harvested from siRNA-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). NOXA levels were increased on average
>5-fold in all tumors analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
The up-regulation of NOXA in the SKOV3 cell line, reported to
be p53 null, suggested that siSV1 can induce NOXA by a p53independent mechanism. To conclusively show this p53 independence, we repeated these experiments using the isogenic ovarian
cancer cells A2780 (p53 wild-type) and A2780CP20 (p53 mutant).
Again, and consistent with p53 independence, NOXA was upregulated in both and the same degree of apoptosis was observed
in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Finally, we examined the effect of combined NOXA and KLF6SV1 inhibition on apoptosis. KLF6-SV1–mediated apoptosis was
completely abrogated following NOXA silencing (Fig. 4D). This loss
was evident across all tumor cell lines tested, including ovarian
(SKOV3; Fig. 4D) and prostate (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145; data not

shown) cancers. This response was NOXA specific because, and
as an adjunct to siRNA-mediated inhibition, we also tested the
apoptotic response of BAX wild-type and null isogenic derivatives
of HCT116 cells. The presence or absence of BAX had no effect on
siSV1-induced apoptosis (data not shown).
KLF6-SV1 binds and targets NOXA for degradation with
resulting Mcl-1 accumulation. Because NOXA plays a role in
DNA damage–induced apoptosis (25, 26), we next examined NOXA
induction and stability in response to DNA damage in cells engineered to stably overexpress KLF6-SV1 (pSV1). NOXA RNA and
protein levels were induced f100-fold in control cells following
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A). In marked contrast, NOXA protein was
undetectable in cells overexpressing KLF6-SV1 despite NOXA RNA
levels being increased f100-fold. In addition, both endogenous
and overexpressed (lane 4) KLF6-SV1 protein was also degraded
following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A). In contrast, KLF6-SV1
overexpression had no effect on two other proapoptotic proteins,
PUMA and BAX. Finally, and in further support of the antiapoptotic
function of KLF6-SV1 and its ability to confer resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death, cells overexpressing KLF6-SV1 were decidedly less susceptible to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B).
Owing to its alternative splicing, KLF6-SV1 lacks the KLF6 zinc
finger DNA binding domain while retaining the majority of the KLF6

www.aacrjournals.org

NH2-terminal activation domain (17). The KLF activation domain,
in general, mediates a broad range of protein-protein interactions
and accounts for the diverse biological activities of the KLF family
(27). Therefore, we hypothesized that KLF6-SV1 complexes with
NOXA in part through this domain and this physical interaction
results in their mutual and rapid degradation. This KLF6-SV1-NOXA
neutralization model would in essence mimic the highly specific,
physical interactions between BH3 ligands and Bcl-2 homologues
required for initiation of apoptosis (8).
Two independent techniques confirmed our hypothesis. First, coexpressed tagged forms of NOXA and KLF6-SV1 were shown to physically interact by coimmunoprecipation in SKOV3 cells (Fig. 5C).
Second, and in a second cell line, endogenous NOXA in PC3 cell
lysates was shown to bind COOH-terminal, dual-tagged (streptavidin binding peptide/calmodulin binding peptide) KLF6-SV1
through use of tandem affinity purification (TAP; Fig. 5C, bottom).
Given these results, we first tested whether KLF6-SV1 binding
had an effect on NOXA stability. The half-life of transfected NOXA
alone was f120 minutes, whereas in the presence of KLF6-SV1
half-life was decreased to f25 minutes (Fig. 5D). Thus, KLF6-SV1
overexpression increases NOXA degradation.
NOXA binds Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
(8, 28–31), and antagonizes its prosurvival function (8, 32). Therefore,

we examined the indirect effects that KLF6-SV1 might have on Mcl-1
protein levels. In general, following cisplatin-induced DNA damage,
Mcl-1 protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and in turn,
NOXA is released and induces apoptosis (32). In our studies, and in
contrast to control cells, Mcl-1 evaded complete degradation in
cells overexpressing KLF6-SV1 despite cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A).
Conversely, targeted inhibition of KLF6-SV1 resulted in decreased

endogenous Mcl-1 levels, further supporting a regulatory effect of
KLF6-SV1 on Mcl-1 levels (Supplementary Fig. S6).
KLF6-SV1 is ubiquitinated and its degradation is HDM2
mediated. How does KLF6-SV1 binding to NOXA triggers their
mutual degradation? We first ascertained whether the degradation
was proteasome mediated because KLF6 has been previously
shown to be ubiquitinated (33, 34). Treatment of SKOV3 cells with

the potent and selective proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in
dramatic increases in KLF6-SV1 and NOXA (Fig. 6A). We therefore
hypothesized that KLF6-SV1 may serve as a substrate for ubiquitin
modification. To test this, we coexpressed V5-tagged KLF6-SV1 and
HA-tagged ubiquitin in 293T cells and coimmunoprecipitated the
cell lysates. Immunoblotting of these lysates revealed that KLF6SV1 is ubquitinated (Fig. 6A, bottom).
To identify the regulator of their proteasome-mediated degradation, we used a candidate gene approach. We first tested whether

HDM2, a well-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with
several key cancer genes, including p53 (35, 36), and targets them
for degradation, may be involved. HDM2 overexpression markedly
reduced KLF6-SV1 protein levels, but not RNA levels (data not
shown), and this effect was abolished with the addition of MG132
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). The effect of suppressing HDM2 activity, using a synthetic compound that binds strongly to HDM2 and
irreversibly blocks the formation of the HDM2/p53 protein
complex (37), on KLF6-SV1 and NOXA protein levels was then

antibody. B, MDM2 inhibition leads to KLF6-SV1 and NOXA accumulation. Cells were treated with either increasing amounts of a synthetic inhibitor of MDM2 (EMD) for
6 h or RNAi targeting nontargeting control or HDM2 and cell lysates were immunoblotted with KLF6-SV1, NOXA, and actin. C, suppression of MDM2 abolished cisplatininduced degradation of KLF6-SV1 and NOXA. Cells were simultaneously treated with cisplatin (50 Amol/L) and the MDM2 inhibitor (40 Amol/L) for 12 h and for protein
analysis. D, HDM2 coimmunoprecipitates with KLF6-SV1. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations were performed using 293T cell extracts overexpressing pSV1-V5 and
pMDM2-flag or pSV1-V5 alone. Top, soluble protein extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP ) with anti-V5 or anti-flag antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting.

tested. Escalating doses of the inhibitor resulted in an accumulation of both KLF6-SV1 and NOXA in both SKOV3 cells (Fig. 6B) and
HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). HDM2 inhibition also blocked
cisplatin-induced degradation of KLF6-SV1 and NOXA (Fig. 6C).
Having identified this HDM2 requirement for cisplatin-induced
degradation, we further characterized this finding by testing whether
HDM2 and KLF6-SV1 can interact in a complex. The interaction
between these two proteins was shown first by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays in SKOV3 cells using HDM2-flag–tagged and
KLF6-SV1-V5–tagged constructs (Fig. 6D, top) and then by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays of endogenous proteins using
293HEK cellular extracts (Fig. 6D, bottom).

Discussion
In this study, we initially sought to explore the potential therapeutic efficacy of siRNA-mediated inhibition of KLF6-SV1 in
ovarian cancer. KLF6-SV1 inhibition not only induced spontaneous
apoptosis of tumor cells in culture and in vivo but also restored
their chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Currently, ovarian cancer

treatment comprises a dual approach based on tumor debulking
through surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy using a
combination of platinum- and taxane-based agents. Nonetheless,
treatment failure occurs in the majority of patients because of late
presentation and the development of chemoresistance (12). In an
effort to overcome therapeutic failure, efforts have been made to
optimize available cytotoxic agents by changing the route of
administration or combining agents (38). I.p. delivery of chemotherapeutic agents would theoretically target the principal site of
ovarian disease while minimizing some of the systemic toxicities
associated with treatment. Our results suggest that siRNAmediated treatment against KLF6-SV1 offers a novel, mechanismbased approach, which induces spontaneous apoptosis in tumor
cells and restores cisplatin sensitivity. A particularly relevant aspect
of our findings, given that most late-stage ovarian tumors are p53
deficient (39), is that this effect is p53 independent.
An intriguing similarity offered by the genetic relationship between KLF6 and KLF6-SV1 and other apoptosis family members
is the fact that several proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway
are themselves regulated by alternative splicing (40). This results in

KLF6-SV1 Is a Targetable Prosurvival Protein

proteins generated from the same gene but with antagonistic
functions or tissue altered expression patterns. With this in mind,
it is noteworthy that our results identified a physical interaction
between KLF6-SV1, which retains the wild-type KLF6 NH2-terminal
activation domain, and NOXA, which results in their mutual and
rapid HDM2-mediated degradation. Interestingly, KLF6 also binds
NOXA and HDM2 but this pairing does not result in NOXA
degradation (results not shown), further highlighting the specificity
of the KLF6-SV1/NOXA interaction. The proposed KLF6-SV1/NOXA
neutralization model, albeit providing a new layer of complexity to
the apoptotic cascade, would parallel the highly specific, physical
interactions between BH3 ligands and Bcl-2 homologues already
known to be required for initiation of apoptosis (8).
The downstream effect of this interaction between KLF6-SV1
and NOXA is the stabilization of Mcl-1. Without this interaction,
Mcl-1 is normally rapidly degraded in response to cell death signals
due to its displacement from the BAK/Mcl-1 complex triggered by
NOXA induction (8, 33, 41). Interestingly, elevated Mcl-1 expression
has been previously correlated with resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents (42), and its transcriptional repression by c-myc or by a
multikinase inhibitor sensitizes cells to TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand–induced apoptosis (43).
Thus, KLF6-SV1 is a prosurvival/antiapoptotic protein that
functions through the degradation of a proapoptotic/BH3-only family

member. This suggests a novel ‘‘fourth’’ level of regulation in the apoptotic cascade. Interestingly, the existence of such a tier has already
been defined. Chlamydiae, obligate intracellular bacteria, are known
to escape destruction by averting apoptosis in infected human cells
(44). They do so by broadly degrading BH3-only proteins, including
NOXA. Most recently, a chlamydia-secreted protease factor was shown
to be responsible for the degrading activity (45). Identification of
KLF6-SV1 as a protein that can target a proapoptotic BH3-only molecule for destruction establishes a paradigm for the existence of other
host-derived factors and intrinsic regulatory pathways important in
cancer. Based on our findings, these host-encoded factors, including
KLF6-SV1, may represent future therapeutic targets for cancers, which
by definition have subverted apoptotic control mechanisms.
