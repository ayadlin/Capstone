Abstract
Resistance to platinum drugs has emerged as a major obstacle in the treatment of ovarian cancers. Through
proteomic analysis, we have found that the expression of annexin A3, a member of the Ca2+ and phospholipidbinding annexin family, is significantly increased in platinum-resistant ovarian cell lines. Anti–annexin A3
immunostaining indicated that cancers from platinum-resistant patients also possess higher levels of annexin A3 than those from platinum-sensitive patients. Although expression of annexin A3 made susceptible
ovarian cancer cells more resistant to platinum, expression of antisense annexin A3 downregulated its expression and rendered the resistant cells more sensitive to platinum. In athymic mice, the growth of tumors
from inoculated SKOV3 cells was inhibited by the administration of platinum, whereas tumors from annexin
A3–expressing SKOV3/Ann were resistant to platinum treatment. Interestingly, the intracellular platinum
concentration and platinum-DNA binding are significantly lower in annexin A3–overexpressing cells than
those in parental cells. The lower cisplatin concentration was also accompanied by reduced induction of
p53, which could be restored by downregulation of annexin A3. These results indicate that increased expression of annexin A3 is a mechanism of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. It seems to act by preventing uptake or accumulation of platinum in cells. Therefore, it is conceivable that annexin A3 could be a
target for therapeutic intervention and may also serve as a biomarker for drug resistance in ovarian cancer
patients. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1616–24. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of cancer death
from gynecologic tumors in the world. Cytoreductive surgery
followed by a platinum-based chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy at present. However, initial responses to the
drugs are often followed by the eventual evolution of fatal drug
resistance. There are also no biomarkers that have achieved
the necessary specificity to predict the development of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer patients. This has prompted
extensive studies to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of platinum resistance in various cancer cells. Development of platinum resistance has been attributed to

decreased drug accumulation, enhanced detoxification capability, aberrant apoptosis pathway, and increased repair of
drug-induced DNA damage (1–8). It has been reported that
metallothioneins (9), glutathione S-transferase π (10), p53
(11), ERCC1 (12), copper transporters (13), and XIAP (14)
can be responsible for these changes in cells. However, it is still
not fully understood how these genes render cells resistant to
platinum, and there are conflicting data regarding their roles
in platinum resistance in patients (15–18).
Annexins belong to the protein family that includes five
groups (A–E); among which, those in group A are the human
and vertebrate orthologues and are identified numerically
(19). As Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, annexins often function as organizers of membrane domains
and membrane-recruitment platforms for proteins in response to Ca2+ flux in cells (20). Therefore, they have diversified activities that include mediating the anti-inflammation
action of glucocorticoids, participating in the regulation of
blood coagulation, modulating ion channels, and participating in membrane fusion and exocytosis (19). The ability of
annexin A5 to bind phosphatidylserine also makes it a valuable tool to detect apoptosis (21).
We have found that annexin A3 is one of the proteins upregulated in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (22).
In present study, the role of annexin A3 in platinum resistance is investigated through examining primary tumors
and their gene overexpression and downregulation in culture
and in athymic mice. Our data indicate that increased expression of annexin A3 is a specific mechanism for platinum
resistance in ovarian cancers.

Annexin A3 Overexpression Confers Platinum Resistance

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. Human epithelial
ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, SKOV3/Cis, SKOV3/Car,
A2780, A2780/Cis, and A2780/Car were described previously
(16, 23). They were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 150 μg/mL
streptomycin.
Western blot analysis. The level of annexin A3 and p53
were analyzed using standard Western blot procedures described previously (23) with the rabbit anti-human annexin
A3 primary antibody (24) and mouse anti-human p53 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively.
Fluorescence microscopy. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min and made permeable with
0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min, they were incubated at 4°C overnight with anti–annexin A3 antibody. Following incubation
with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with fluorescein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cell nuclei were stained
with propidium iodide for 20 min. The specimens were examined under a Radiance 2100 confocal laser-scanning
microscope (400×; Bio-Rad).
Patients, tissue specimens, and pathologic data. Tumor
tissues were collected from 42 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer from 2000 to 2005 at the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital,
Beijing, China. The patients gave informed consent according
to the criteria used at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Relevant clinical information was gathered, and tissue
samples and clinical data were anonymized. The tissue specimens were taken intraoperatively, immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
The 42 patients were consecutively selected as follows: (a)
patients who suffered from primary epithelial ovarian cancer;
(b) patients who obtained the primary treatment in our hospital; (c) patients who nearly harbored no residual tumors
after initial debulking surgery and comprehensive staging
surgery; (d) patients who received a standard platinum combined adjuvant chemotherapy in at least six courses; and (e)
patients who were in a routine follow-up for more than 3
years or till death.
According to the definition, all tissue specimens of the patients were divided into two groups, the platinum-sensitive
group and the platinum-resistant group. Patients who responded to initial platinum-based therapy and experienced
a treatment-free interval of 6 months or more are considered
to be clinically platinum sensitive. Those who progress while
on initial platinum-based therapy, whose best response to
initial therapy is stable disease, or who relapse after initial
response within 6 mo of completion of platinum-based
therapy are considered to be clinically platinum resistant (25).
Follow-up. Patients were seen for follow-up 1 to 5 y after
surgery; every 1 mo thereafter during the first year, every 3
mo in the second year, and then 6 mo or annually during
the subsequent years. At each visit, a serum CA125 analysis
and a pelvic examination were performed. Imaging studies or
biopsies were performed as appropriate.

Immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining of tissue sections was performed using Dako LASB system (DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The
sections of normal hepatic tissue were used as positive controls for annexin A3. As a negative control, the sections were
incubated with rabbit IgG at the same dilution. The tissue
sections were evaluated under a light microscope (400×)
and scored as follows: 1, no detectable immunostaining; 2,
immunostaining <25%; 3, immunostaining between 25%
and 50%; 4, immunostaining between 50% and 75%; 5, immunostaining >75%. The immunostaining intensity was evaluated by two independent observers who were blinded to
clinical and annexin A3 data.
Construction of sense and antisense annexin A3–
expressing plasmids and gene transfection. Annexin A3
cDNA (Genbank accession number gi: 4826642) was cloned
through reverse transcriptase-PCR from SKOV3 cells and
inserted into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen).
The sequence and orientation of the constructs were
confirmed by sequencing. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
was used to transfect the cells according to manufacturer's
instruction. Stable transfectants were obtained by selecting
with medium containing 800 μg/mL G418.
Drug sensitivity assay. Single-cell suspensions were prepared and dispersed in 96-well plates. After incubation for
72 h with the platinum compounds, the MTT (Sigma) solution (0.5 mg/mL) was added. Following incubation for 4 h,
100 μL of extraction buffer were added to each well. After
an overnight incubation, absorbance at 540 nm was measured using an Immunoskan 340 (Labsystems).
Intracellular content of cisplatin. Cells were seeded in
triplicate at a density of 2 × 106/mL in complete medium
and incubated with 10 μmol/L of cisplatin for 24 h. After
washing three times with PBS, cells were scraped free in
1 mL of PBS. Following centrifugation at 4°C, the pellets
were digested in 70% nitric acid at 65°C for 2 h and diluted
to 5% nitric acid by adding an appropriate volume of doubledistilled deionized water. Platinum in the hydrolysate was
quantified using Agilent 7500ce inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent).
Cisplatin-DNA binding. After being treated with 10 μmol/L
of cisplatin for 24 h, the cells were washed three times with
ice-cold PBS and harvested. A FlexiGene DNA Kit (Qiagen)
was used for isolation of DNA. Aliquots of the DNA were
digested in 70% nitric acid at 65°C for 2 h and diluted to 5%
nitric acid. Platinum content was measured using Agilent
7500ce ICP-MS (Agilent).
In vivo tumor growth inhibition studies. All of the procedures involving animals in this study were approved by the
animal care committee of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital in accordance with institutional and Chinese government guidelines for animal experiments. SKOV3 and
SKOV3/Ann cells were harvested during exponential growth
of the cell culture. Five-week-old female nu/nu athymic mice
were randomly divided into each group (n = 5) before inoculation. Five million cells were implanted s.c. in the flank of
each mouse. I.p. cisplatin treatment (3 mg/kg/d) was initiated just after the inoculation in the treatment group and was

given every 2 d for a total of four times. The mice in control
groups were treated with saline. Tumors were measured
across three dimensions twice a week, and the tumor volume
(mm3) was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = π (length × width × thickness) / 6. Inhibition of tumor
growth was calculated according to the following formula:
(1− the mean tumor volume of the treated group / the mean
tumor volume of the control group at the time point of
observation) × 100%.
Statistical analysis. Results were expressed as the mean ±
SD of three to five independent experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA and Student's t
test to evaluate the continuous variables. To determine the
relative significance between annexin A3 immunohistochemical staining and other factors such as drug resistance,

Differences between groups were considered significant
at P < 0.05. Data analyses were carried out using SPSS11.5

Results
Expression of annexin A3 is increased in platinumresistant ovarian cancer cells and tumors from patients.
Between the two antitumor platinum compounds, cisplatin
is commonly used for in vitro studies to investigate the mechanisms of platinum resistance, whereas carboplatin is
widely used in the clinic due to its lower toxicity to the peripheral nervous system and kidneys. To determine whether
the resistant cell line selected by cisplatin is also resistant to

carboplatin, and vice versa, we assessed the viability of parental cell lines (SKOV3 and A2780), cisplatin-selected cell
lines (SKOV3/Cis and A2780/Cis), and carboplatin-selected
cell lines (SKOV3/Car and A2780/Car) following treatment
with different concentrations of cisplatin or carboplatin. As
shown in Fig. 1A, all the selected cell lines are more resistant
to both cisplatin and carboplatin, suggesting that these cells
developed similar mechanisms that make them resistant to
the platinum compounds.
We have compared the mass spectrum profiles of the two
sensitive cell lines (SKOV3 and A2780) with that of the four
resistant cell lines (SKOV3/Cis, SKOV3/Cis, A2780/Car, and
A2780/Car). Thirty-six differentially expressed proteins were
identified (22). Among them, the altered expressions of annexin A3, destrin, cofilin, glutathione S-transferase, and cytoplasmic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase have
been validated using quantitative PCR and immunoblotting.
In particular, the level of annexin A3 increased by 3- to 20fold in all of the resistant cell lines (22). We also examined
the expression of annexin A3 in the platinum-resistant cell
lines by immunofluorescent staining with anti–annexin A3
antibody. In all the resistant cell lines, there is a significantly
increased expression of annexin A3 that is mainly located in

the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear area and likely
on the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1B).
To determine whether the expression of annexin A3 is related to platinum resistance, a total of 42 eligible patients, 50% of
whom had ovarian cancers that were resistant to carboplatin,
were enrolled and anti–annexin A3 immunostaining was performed on tumor tissue sections. The characteristics of 42 patients are shown in Table 1. There was no statistical difference
among characteristics of patient data between the sensitive
and the resistant groups. As observed in cultured cell lines, annexin A3 is mostly present in the perinuclear area in annexin
A3–positive cancers (Fig. 1C). Compared with that of platinum-sensitive tumors, the immunostaining scores are significantly higher in platinum-resistant tumors (P = 0.035; Fig. 1D),
indicating that the expression of annexin A3 is increased in
tumors that are resistant to the platinum compounds.
Annexin A3 is a specific protein associated with platinum resistance. To further understand the role of annexin
A3 in platinum resistance, SKOV3 and A2780 cells were
transfected with an annexin A3–expressing plasmid and selected with G418 to generate stable transfectants. Compared
with parental and vector-transfected cells, the stable transfectants of SKOV3 and A2780 (named SKOV3/Ann and

A2780/Ann) express significantly higher levels of annexin
A3 (Fig. 2A). We were also able to obtain stable transfectants
by transfecting the four resistant cell lines with an antisense
annexin A3–expressing construct and selecting with G418.
The levels of annexin A3 were dramatically decreased in
these transfectants (named SKOV3/Cis/R, SKOV3/Car/R,
A2780/Cis/R, and A2780/Car/R; Fig. 2A). The sensitivities of
these transfected cell lines to cisplatin and carboplatin were
then assessed by the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, SKOV3/
Ann and A2780/Ann exhibited a right-shifted dose-survival
curve and become more resistant to cisplatin and carbopla-

tin (Fig. 2B; Table 2). Compared with corresponding vectortransfected cells (SKOV3/Vec and A2780/Vec), the IC50 for
cisplatin increased by 3.7- and 2.9-fold. Similar increases of
IC50 were observed for carboplatin. Consistent with these results, SKOV3/Cis/R, SKOV3/Car/R, A2780/Cis/R, and A2780/
Car/R all exhibited a left-shifted dose-survival curve when
treated with the platinum compounds. The IC50 for them
had a 1.6- to 2.4-fold decrease (Fig. 2C; Table 2).
It has been shown that tumor cells may develop crossresistance toward various chemotherapeutic drugs in a
single-step selection (16). We asked whether these cell lines

transfected cells. Transfection of SKOV3 and A2780 with annexin A3–expressing construct generated SKOV3/Ann and A2780/Ann, which express high
levels of annexin A3. The resistant cell lines, SKOV3/Cis, SKOV3/Car, A2780/Cis, and A2780/Car, were transfected with antisense annexin A3–expressing
plasmid. The transfectants, SKOV3/Cis/R, SKOV3/Car/R, A2780/Cis/R, and A2780/Car/R, express little annexin A3. Transfection of control vector to these
cells generate SKOV3/Vec, A2780/Vec, SKOV3/Cis/V, SKOV3/Car/V, A2780/Cis/V, and A2780/Car/V, which had similar levels of annexin A3 with that of
the parental cells. B, expression of annexin A3 made SKOV3 and A2780 cells more resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin. C, downregulation of annexin A3 made
platinum-resistant cell lines more sensitive to cisplatin and carboplatin. Data represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

have also become resistant to Taxol and epirubicin. Whereas
the platinum compounds kill tumor cells by causing
cross-linking of DNA, Taxol and epirubicin act by preventing
the breakdown of microtubules during cell division and
intercalating DNA strands, respectively. Interestingly, the
four resistant cell lines, SKOV3/Cis, SKOV3/Car, A2780/Cis,
and A2780/Car, are also more resistant to Taxol and epirubicin, with a 1.6- to 4.5-fold increase of IC50. However, resistance to these two compounds is not affected by enforced
expression or downregulation of annexin A3 (Table 2), suggesting that other mechanisms, such as increased expression
of glutathione S-transferase, may be responsible for their
resistance in these cells. Taken together, these results
indicate that an elevated level of annexin A3 is a specific
mechanism for the increased tolerance to the platinum
compounds in ovarian cancer cells.

Increase in expression of Annexin A3 reduces the
accumulation of platinum in cells and decreases cisplatin-induced p53. One of the commonly accepted cellular mechanisms that contribute to resistance against various
chemotherapeutic agents is reduced cellular accumulation
of the drugs by a number of proposed methods (26). To determine whether this mechanism is related to the acquired
resistance to the platinum compounds in ovarian cancer
cells, cisplatin cellular accumulation and DNA binding were
determined in the cell lines. After incubating with 10 μmol/L
of cisplatin for 24 hours, the intracellular concentrations of
cisplatin in SKOV3/Ann and A2780/Ann were significantly
lower than those in SKOV3/Vec and A2780/Vec (Fig. 3A).
The intracellular concentration of cisplatin in antisense annexin A3–transfected cells (SKOV3/Cis/R and A2780/Cis/R)
was also significantly higher than in SKOV3/Cis and

A2780/Cis cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 3A). As
shown in Fig. 3B, similar results were observed when the levels of DNA-bound platinum were measured in various cell
lines treated with cisplatin. These results indicated that overexpression of annexin A3 causes the decrease of intracellular
platinum levels. Given the association of annexin family proteins with the membranes, it is conceivable annexin A3 may
affect the transmembrane transportation of cisplatin. This
may be particularly relevant to the nuclear uptake of cisplatin, as overexpressed annexin A3 is concentrated around the
nucleus.
As a critical guardian of the genome, the intracellular level
of tumor suppressor p53 is tightly controlled, primarily
through Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation (27, 28). In response to DNA damage, p53 level
is increased to induce a cell cycle block, senescence, or
apoptosis (29). It plays an important role in the cytotoxic
action of chemotherapeutic agents in tumors retaining a
wild-type p53 gene and may also be used as readout for
the cellular effects of DNA-damaging agents. We asked
whether overexpression of annexin A3 in A2780 cells, which
contain wild-type p53, could affect cisplatin-induced increase
of p53. As shown in Fig. 3C, expression of annexin A3
reduced the p53 response induced by cisplatin (compare
lanes 2 and 4). Although the high–annexin A3 cell line
A2780/Cis showed little p53 upregulation in response to cisplatin (compare lanes 5 and 6), downregulation of annexin
A3 caused the cell line (A2780/Cis/R) to respond to cisplatin
with a significant increase of p53 (compare lanes 7 and 8).
These results are consistent with the observation that

1622

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

overexpression of annexin A3 reduces the amount of platinum
bound to DNA and indicate that increased annexin A3 is likely
the major mechanism responsible for cisplatin resistance.
Enforced expression of annexin A3 confers platinum
resistance in vivo. To determine whether overexpression
of annexin A3 influences the sensitivity of ovarian cancer
cells to platinum in vivo, athymic nude mice were inoculated
with either SKOV3 or SKOV3/Ann cells. Both cell lines gave
rise to tumors whose volume increased similarly postinoculation (Fig. 4A and B). Mice in the treatment group received
cisplatin at 3 mg/kg/d i.p. every 2 days for a total of four
times. Whereas cisplatin significantly inhibited the increase
of the mean volumes of tumors from SKOV3 cells (Fig. 4A),
it had much less of an effect on the growth of tumors from
SKOV3/Ann cells (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, there are significant differences in mean tumor volumes between these
two treated groups from day 27 to day 54 postinoculation.
By day 54, treatment with cisplatin resulted in a reduction
of tumor volume by 76.9 ± 22.5% compared with the controls,
whereas the drug only reduced the size of SKOV3/Ann tumor
by 28.5 ± 13.7% (P = 0.002; Fig. 4D). These results show
that overexpression of annexin A3 in ovarian cancer cells is
sufficient to confer resistance to cisplatin in vivo.

Discussion
Our studies found that annexin A3 is upregulated in ovarian cancer cells that are more resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin. There is also a significant increase of annexin A3 in
platinum-resistant cancers from patients. Overexpression of

Annexin A3 Overexpression Confers Platinum Resistance

annexin alone is sufficient to make the cells more resistant to
the drugs in vitro and in vivo, whereas downregulation of annexin A3 makes the cells more sensitive to the platinum
compounds. Furthermore, we have shown that annexin A3
selectively confers resistance to the platinum compounds
through decreasing their intracellular concentration, which
leads to a reduced p53 response to the drugs. The role of
annexins in drug resistance was also supported by the findings that an increased expression of annexin A1 made cultured cells resistant to multiple drugs, and increased
expression of annexin A4 is associated with resistance to
paclitaxel (30, 31). These observations are also consistent
with the role of annexins in many membrane-related events
and the realization that one of the critical mechanisms in
developing drug resistance is altered membrane protein
trafficking.
Alterations of annexin expression have been found in a variety of cancers. The expression of annexin A1 was found to
be increased in gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and lung adenocarcinoma as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, clear
cell renal carcinoma, and hairy cell leukemia (32). However,
annexins A1, A2, A7, and A11 were reported to be downregulated in a number of tumors (32, 33). In particular, expression
of annexin A3 is increased in colorectal cancer (34) and
prostate cancer (35). It was also found that colorectal cancer
had increased expression of multiple annexins, including A1,
A2, A4, and A11 (36). These studies clearly illustrate that
there are complicated connections between members of
the annexin family and cancers. Given the association between annexin A3 and platinum resistance we reported here,
it is likely that the variations of annexins in tumors may be
significantly affected by their histories of chemotherapies.
Although annexins are known as intracellular proteins, it
has been shown that some annexins, such as A1 and A2, can

be secreted and detected in culture medium or bodily fluids
(37, 38). Therefore, it would be interesting to examine whether annexin A3 could be secreted by cultured ovarian cancer
cells, in particular, those that are resistant to platinum
compounds and express high levels of annexin A3. Given
the increased expression of annexin A3 in tumors from
platinum-resistant patients, it is also conceivable that examining the level of annexin A3 in serum might provide important information regarding the sensitivity of ovarian cancers
to platinum treatment. Interestingly, it has been found
recently that annexin A3 could be detected in urine sample
of patients with prostate cancers, indicating that it is a
hopeful candidate for noninvasive biomarker (39).
