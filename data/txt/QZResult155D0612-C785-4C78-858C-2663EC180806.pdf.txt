BACKGROUND: Anti-angiogenesis agents have shown effectiveness in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
It is important to investigate more effective and safe systemic treatment options for patients with advanced HCC.
This phase 2 study was designed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of bevacizumab, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced unresectable and untransplantable HCC. METHODS: Chemotherapynaive patients with advanced unresectable and untransplantable HCC were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and
oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle, and capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally twice a day from days 1 to 14 of a
21-day cycle. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled to the study, in which 40% had Child-Pugh B disease. Forty percent had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 0, 55% had PS of 1, and 5% had PS of
2. Forty percent of patients had hepatitis B virus infection. The median progression-free survival was 6.8 months
(95% CI, 3.4-9.1 months), and the median overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI, 5.2-12.1 months). Eight patients
(20%) achieved partial response; 23 patients had stable disease with overall 77.5% disease control rate. The combination was tolerable with limited grade 3/4 toxicity, mainly peripheral neurotoxicity and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The
combination appeared effective and safe, and the results were encouraging. Further investigation should be considC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common

cause of cancer-related death worldwide.1 In most cases, HCC is related to chronic hepatic cirrhosis caused by alcohol use
or due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCC is relatively rare in North America compared with the incidence in the Far East; however, recent reports indicate that the incidence of HCC is rising in the United
States, which is most likely due to an increase in the prevalence of HCV infection in this country.2 The overall prognosis
for most HCC patients is usually poor.
Surgical resection is the only modality with a chance of cure. Unfortunately, most patients with HCC are unsuitable
for surgery because of extensive disease, extrahepatic metastases, and underlying liver disease or comorbidities. Orthotopic
liver transplantation improves overall survival for patients with HCC by removing the tumor and the cirrhotic liver but is
possible only for a small group of patients.
Nonsurgical local treatments, eg, hepatic artery embolization or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofreR ) injections, are frequently perquency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and Yttrium90 labeled radiation (TheraSphereV
formed to improve survival and achieve palliation. However, not all patients are suitable for local therapies.
The results of systemic therapy with conventional chemotherapy agents are modest, and targeted therapies have not
shown clear benefit until recently.3 A variety of studies have been conducted to test target-oriented agents, especially antiangiogenic agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, either as single agents or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy,

to improve the outcome of patients with HCC.4-7
Although sorafenib has emerged as an attractive first-line
therapy, response rates remain poor.5 Anti-HCC activity
of both oxaliplatin and capecitabine were suggested from
previous early phase studies.3,4,7,8 Our single-arm, nonrandomized phase 2 study was conducted at the time
before the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC was established;
we tested the combination of bevacizumab, a monoclonal
antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients
with advanced unresectable and metastatic HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
All patients had advanced (unresectable or untransplantable) or metastatic HCC, which was diagnosed by histology or by computed tomography (CT)/magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics typical of HCC
in the setting of cirrhosis with an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
level >500 IU/ml. Patients could not have received radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy for their disease.
Hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization procedures were allowed, but patients were required to have
evidence of measurable or evaluable viable disease, and the
procedures had to be done more than 4 weeks before
enrollment into the study. All patients were 18 years or
older. All patients underwent a complete history and
physical examination. Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (ECOG PS) had to be 0 to 2.
Patients had adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function with the following baseline laboratory values: white
blood count (WBC) 2,500/mm3 with absolute
granulocyte count (ANC) 1,500/mm3; platelet count
75,000/mm3; hemoglobin 9 gm/dL (could have been
transfused with packed red blood cells or received epoetin
alfa to maintain or exceed this level); serum creatinine
2.0 mg/dl; total bilirubin 3.0 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) 5.0 
upper limit of normal (ULN); international normalized
ratio (INR) 1.5 (those patients who were on long-term
warfarin had their INR and prothrombin time (PT)/INR
checked weekly and had to be stable). Patients with a
history of moderate ascites or encephalopathy were not
excluded. Pregnancy was ruled out for female patients. In
addition, all patients had a-fetoprotein (AFP) measured
within 2 weeks of treatment initiation and imaging (CT
or MRI) within 4 weeks of enrollment. All patients signed
the institutional review board (IRB)-approved consent

form and complete records were maintained. Exclusion
criteria included significant cardiovascular disease, stroke,
renal impairment, and brain metastases. For those
patients who had embolization or chemoembolization
therapy, full anticoagulation was not permitted. No
patient had a history of allergy to murine proteins.
The primary end point was progression-free survival
(PFS). The secondary end points were response rate (RR)
and overall survival (OS). We also evaluated tolerability
and toxicity of the regimen. Statistical analysis was done
using SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). We used
medians for most univariable measures; survival analysis
was done using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The initial evaluation of response was carried out after 2 cycles (6 weeks); thereafter, response was reevaluated
every 2 cycles. Modified response evaluation criteria in
solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria were used. Responses
were defined as complete response (CR), which is complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease lasting for at least 4 weeks and no new lesions; partial
response (PR), 50% decrease of the sum of the products
of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions and
no new lesions; progressive disease (PD), a 25% or greater
increase in the sum of products of measurable lesions over
the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) or
reappearance of any lesion that had disappeared, clear
worsening of any evaluable disease, or appearance of any
new lesion/site; or stable disease (SD), no change (neither
PR nor PD).
Treatment Plan
All patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin,
and bevacizumab. Each treatment cycle was 21 days. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg was administered as an intravenous
infusion (initially over 90  15 minutes, the second infusion was delivered over 60  10 minutes, and subsequent
infusions over 30  10 minutes, if the initial infusion was
tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events), and
oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 was given intravenously over 2
hours on day 1 of each cycle. Capecitabine was given 825
mg/m2 orally twice a day from days 1 to 14 of each cycle.
On study, patients had a history and physical examination repeated on the first day of each treatment cycle.
Hematologic and metabolic laboratory evaluations were
done weekly for the first 2 cycles; in the absence of significant abnormalities, they were then done on the first day of
each subsequent cycle. An AFP level and urinalysis were
done on the first day of each cycle. Imaging (CT or MRI)
was repeated every 2 cycles to assess response. Each

RESULTS
A total of 40 patients were enrolled from July 2004 to
June 2007. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Except 1, all patients had stage 4 disease, and most
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. At entry, 23 (57.5%)

had HCV and alcohol, 3 had HBV and HCV, 2 had
HCV with HBV and alcohol), 16 with HBV infections
(11 had HBV only), 10 with alcoholic cirrhosis, and 4
patients without clear etiology. Interestingly, only 17

One patient had gastric perforation and resultant fatal sepsis without neutropenia 1 day after the first administration of bevacizumab and oxaliplatin.

cycles were administered. On average, patients received
8.7 cycles of treatment (median, 5; range, 1-38).
Toxicity Profile
The treatment was well tolerated overall. One patient had
gastric perforation and resultant fatal sepsis without neutropenia 1 day after the first administration of bevacizumab and oxaliplatin. This was considered likely secondary
to the patient’s cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices, but
we nonetheless reported it as probably related to the treatment regimen (grade 5). Multi-organ failure, atrial fibrillation, and hyperglycemia were recorded in the same
patient as well, each of which was considered to be not
directly related to the treatment regimen.
Other major toxicities are detailed in Table 2.
Besides the expected side effects (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, anorexia), agent-specific side effects included
hand-foot syndrome (capecitabine), sensory neuropathy
(oxaliplatin), and headache and edema (bevacizumab).
Other disease-related events were ascites (2 patients),
hyperammonemia (4 patients), and variceal hemorrhage
(4 patients). No treatment-related toxicity differences
were noticed in patients with Child-Pugh A status compared with those with Child-Pugh B.
Efficacy
We evaluated the best response for each patient while on
the study. Of the total of 40 patients, 36 patients were
evaluable for response (1 patient’s disease progressed
before receiving therapy, 1 patient signed consent but later
withdrew from study, and 2 patients came off the study

right after receiving the first treatment and did not have
disease assessment). The median progression-free survival
was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.4-9.1 months) (Fig. 1). The
median overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI, 5.212.1 months) (Fig. 2). There were no complete responses
observed. Eight patients (20%) achieved partial response
and 23 (57.3%) patients had stable disease. Therefore, a
total of 31 (77.5%) patients achieved disease control (PR
þ SD). One patient is still alive with 3 years of follow-up,
who had been treated for 33 cycles; oxaliplatin was held
after 10 cycles because of grade 3 neurotoxicity. The
patient had surgical resection of his 2 liver lesions, which
were previously unresectable.

DISCUSSION
In this single-arm phase 2 study, we evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of the combination of an anti-angio-

3190

genic agent, bevacizumab, with cytotoxic chemotherapy
agents, oxaliplatin and capecitabine, in patients with
advanced unresectable and untransplantable HCC. This
study demonstrated encouraging results for both efficacy
and toxicity. Partial response was seen in 20% of the
patients and 78% had their disease controlled (PR þ SD).
One patient had his previously unresectable lesions
removed and has lived more than 3 years. The study also
showed a median PFS of 6.8 months and a median OS of
9.8 months in a patient population of 60% with ECOG
PS 1-2, and more than 35% of the patients with ChildPugh class B disease status. Although sorafenib has
become standard therapy for advanced/metastatic HCC
based on 2 randomized, placebo-controlled studies, the
SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials,5,9 there have been many
unanswered questions and considerations. It has been suggested—with some controversy—that the etiology of the
underlying liver disease, eg, HBV versus HCV, may affect

Cancer

the effectiveness of sorafenib.10-13 The differences in median PFS and OS between the SHARP trial (5.5 months
and 10.7 months) and the Asia-Pacific trial (2.8 months
[TTP] and 6.5 months) have been considered to be due at
least partially to the difference in HBV status (20% vs
70%). Forty percent of patients in our study had HBV
infection (including 11 patients with HBV only and 5
patients with both HBV and HCV). Most studies find
that the underlying disease and functional status, as
assessed by various staging systems (Child-Pugh, Okuda,
BCLC, etc.), and performance scores (ECOG, World
Health Organization), are good markers of prognosis.
Furthermore, there is a lack of information regarding the
application of sorafenib in HCC patients with ChildPugh B or C status. Both SHARP and Asia-Pacific studies
had more than 95% patients with ECOG PS 0 and
Child-Pugh A status. Sixty percent of patients in our study
had ECOG PS 1-2, and 35% of patients had Child-Pugh
B disease status (2 patients had Child-Pugh C status).
VEGF is thought to have an important role in HCC
angiogenesis;14 its expression has been confirmed in this
disease and has been associated with poor prognosis. The
efficacy of sorafenib, a multiple pathway tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, in the treatment of HCC is believed to be
mainly via its effect of anti-angiogenesis rather than that
of anti-BRaf. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized
version of a murine anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been approved for treatment of a variety of
malignancies, including colorectal, breast, and lung cancers, as well as glioblastoma.15 In HCC, its activity as a
single agent or in combination has been suggested in several phase 2 studies.6,7,16-18 Interestingly, a randomized
phase 3 study presented in abstract form showed that the
combination of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (FOLFOX4)
is more effective and less toxic compared with the more
traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agent doxorubicin in
advanced and metastatic HCC.19
Our data demonstrate good tolerability as well, with
mild to moderate grade 3/4 toxicity (<10% hematologic
grade 3/4 toxicities), which is less than what is seen with
other combination regimens with relatively newer chemotherapy agents,19-21 despite a relatively less optimal performance status patient population in our study. The
toxicity profile of this regimen was favorable compared
with the other combination regimens with biologic agents
and chemotherapeutic agents.4,7 The combination of
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin with bevacizumab caused
42% grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 27% grade 3 hypertension,
and 33% grade 3 AST elevation.7 The combination of

Cancer

July 15, 2011

gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and cetuximab showed 53%
overall grade 3 or 4 toxicities.4
In terms of efficacy, although cross-study comparisons should be made with caution, especially for small
phase 2 studies primarily evaluating tolerability without
any control arms, it is notable that our regimen achieved
PFS and OS in line with extant literature. The largest controlled trials, SHARP and Asia-Pacific, had OS of 10.7
months and 6.5 months, respectively, highlighting that
underlying HCC and liver disease characteristics probably
affect response significantly.
In summary, we demonstrate encouraging efficacy
and good tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab
with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, even in those patients
with suboptimal performance status and liver function.
The combination is an attractive option for further study
as first- or second-line therapy for advanced and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
