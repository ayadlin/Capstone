ABSTRACT
Bortezomib, a novel proteasome inhibitor, has been approved for treating
multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and studied pre-clinically and clinically
for solid tumors. Preferential cytotoxicity of bortezomib was found toward hypoxic
tumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
role of a pretreatment hypoxic tumor microenvironment on the effects of bortezomib
in vitro and ex vivo, and explore the feasibility of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE MRI) to noninvasively evaluate the biological effects of
bortezomib. It was shown in vitro by Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA that
bortezomib accumulated HIF-1` in non-functional forms and blocks its hypoxia
response in human colorectal cancer cell lines. Ex vivo experiments were performed
with fluorescent immunohistochemical staining techniques using multiple endogenous
and exogenous markers to identify hypoxia (pimonidazole, HRE-TKeGFP), blood flow/
permeability (Hoechst 33342), micro-vessels (CD31 and SMA), apoptosis (cleaved
caspase 3) and hypoxia response (CA9). After bortezomib administration, overall
apoptosis index was significantly increased and blood perfusion was dramatically
decreased in tumor xenografts. More importantly, apoptosis signals were found
preferentially located in moderate and severe pretreatment hypoxic regions in
both tumor and endothelial cells. Meanwhile, DCE MRI examinations showed that
the tumor blood flow and permeability decreased significantly after bortezomib
administration. The present study revealed that bortezomib reduces tumor hypoxia
response and blood perfusion, thus, presenting antivascular properties. It will be
important to determine the hypoxic/perfusion status pre- and during treatment at
further translational studies.

milestone in the treatment of multiple myeloma, which
is second most common hematologic cancer in the
United States (after Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma); an
estimated 24,050 new cases and 11,090 deaths in the USA
in 2014  [5].
There are multiple tumor types that exhibit
characteristics associated with a dysregulated ubiquitinproteasome system, including non-small cell lung cancer,
colorectal cancer, and others, which could potentially
benefit from proteasome inhibitor therapy [6–8].
Phase I-II trails for solid tumors were conducted with
either bortezomib alone or combined with radiotherapy
or chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, head and neck
cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [9–11]. However,
expansion of bortezomib in the treatment of the more
complex solid tumors has been less successful [8].
Therefore, it is important to clarify the critical biological
mechanism, recognize the early response, and select the
patient responsive to bortezomib and other proteasome
inhibitors for a successful therapy.
Both clinical and preclinical data suggested that
therapeutic advantage of bortezomib in patients with solid
tumors could be from the strong inhibition of hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1) response [9, 12]. Hypoxia
response is an important protection mechanism for survival
of hypoxic tumor cells [13]. HIF-1, a heterodimeric
complex composed of an O2-labile α-subunit (HIF-1α),
which is degraded by the proteasome under aerobic
conditions, and a stable β-subunit (HIF-1β), mediates the
primary transcriptional response to hypoxic stress in tumor
cells [14]. Although bortezomib blocks the degradation of
HIF-1α in the proteasome, the accumulating HIF-1α
is unable to activate an effective hypoxia response,
rendering tumor cells vulnerable to a hostile hypoxic
microenvironment [12]. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of
bortezomib was found preferential toward not only tumor
cells but also endothelial cells under the hypoxic condition
in vitro [15, 16]. Since hypoxia is one of the fundamental
characteristics of solid tumors [17], it might be feasible to
improve the efficacy of bortezomib taking advantage of its
inhibition effect on hypoxia response.
In this study, we aimed to 1) investigate the role
of pretreatment tumor hypoxic status on the effect of
bortezomib treatment and the effects of bortezomib on
tumor microcirculation; 2) explore the feasibility of using
DCE MRI to noninvasively evaluate the biological effects
of bortezomib.

in HT29 and LoVo cells were significantly higher under
hypoxia (0.2% O2) than under normoxia (20% O2)
(Fig. 1A and 1B). Similarly, the expression of hypoxia
response reporter gene eGFP was increased (Fig. 1D), and
the function of reporter gene TK was also enhanced under
hypoxia (Fig. 1C) in HT29 cells carrying HRE-TK/eGFP.
With bortezomib treatments at indicated doses
(1 μM and 5 μM), HIF-1α subunits in HT29 and LoVo
cells were protected from proteasomal degradation
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1A).
Cellular protein levels of CA9 were strongly inhibited
by bortezomib, in both under normoxia and hypoxia
(Fig. 1A). Excreted VEGF levels decreased significantly
in response to bortezomib treatment (Fig. 1B). The
hypoxia-induced expression of eGFP reporter gene was
significantly decreased after bortezomib treatments
(Fig. 1D), and the TK function at 0.2% O2 condition was
also suppressed more than 100 folds (Fig. 1C). These data
validated that bortezomib could effectively interfere with
the HIF-1 hypoxia response.

Bortezomib induces apoptosis and decreases
tumor blood flow in xenografts

RESULTS

Significant apoptosis was induced in HT29–9HRE
xenografts at 24 h after the bortezomib treatment, with
a higher CCP3 positive percentage (5.26% ± 0.98%)
in the bortezomib group (n = 8) than in the control
group (0.58% ± 0.13%, n = 8), p < 0.001. As shown in
Fig. 2A-b, intense positive CCP3 signals were found
not only  in  tumor cells (1.98% ± 0.41%) but also in
endothelial cells (3.28% ± 0.63%), p < 0.01. However, the
CCP3 positive signal was barely detectable in the control
tumor (Fig. 2A-a).
The overall tumor blood perfusion was dramatically
decreased after the bortezomib treatment, as Hoechst
33342 positive percentage decreased from 18.72% ± 2.59%
in the control group to 3.57% ± 0.83% in the bortezomib
group, p < 0.001. The microenvironment of the tumor after
bortezomib treatments was demonstrated by a representative
section shown in Fig. 2B, with multiple images of IHC
staining of blood flow, blood vessel and apoptosis. Within
the well perfused area (strong positive Hoechst 33342
signals, the rectangular frame, 2B-a) and the poorly perfused
area (no Hoechst 33342 signal, the round circle, 2B-a), the
micro-vessels were all lined with endothelial cells (CD31+,
2B-c) surrounded by pericytes (SMA+, 2B-b). However,
strong apoptosis signals (CCP3+) were only found in the
non-perfused endothelial cells (arrows, 2B-d).

was firstly been characterized with the rigid protocol (Fig. 3).
The results from a representative control tumor are shown in
Fig. 4. It was found that the original hypoxic tumor cells,
labeled by the first hypoxia marker pimonidazole (green),
were located near the necrotic zone (identified by adjacent
H&E staining, data not shown), and the newly developed
hypoxic tumor cells, labeled by the second hypoxia marker
EF5 (red) given 22 h later, emerged near the perfused blood
vessel (blue Hoechst 33342 signal, Fig. 4A-a). Almost all
newly developed hypoxic tumor areas labeled by EF5 (red,
Fig. 4A-a) showed the apparent expression of hypoxia
response protein CA9 (red, Fig. 4A-b).
To investigate the correlation between hypoxia
status and response to bortezomib treatment, the entire
tumor microscopic images from eight tumors in each
group were divided into a batch of 1 × 1 mm2 regions
in which the hypoxia level were classified into three
grades based on the percentage area staining positive
for pimonidazole: mild (<10%), moderate (>10%),
and severe (>20%), respectively. It was demonstrated
as representative areas shown as solid squares 1, 2 and

d, h and l). Meanwhile, the ratio of newly developed
hypoxic cells gradually increased (only EF5 positive
percentages: 3%, 11%, and 32%. b, f and j). However, the
hypoxia response did not increase correspondingly (CA9
positive percentages:11%, 13%, and 8%. c, g and k).
In contrast, after bortezomib treatments, the
relationships between tumor hypoxia and hypoxia
response does not exist any more (Fig. 5). There was
almost no apparent blood perfusion in the central regions,
with only few Hoechst 33342 positive signals in the
peripheral regions (Fig. 5A). The total tumor blood
perfusion significantly decreased in treated tumors, with
Hoechst 33342 positive percentage of 3.57% ± 0.83%
in comparison to 18.72% ± 2.59% in the control group,
p < 0.001. Two major patterns of the relationship between
hypoxia status and hypoxia response were found. At

region with mild pretreatment hypoxia (pimonidazole+,
green, dashed square 1 in Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B-a~e), there
was no de novo hypoxic populations (EF5+, red) but
apparent CA9 expression (red). However, at regions with
moderate (dashed square 2 in Fig. 5A and 5B-f~j) and
severe pretreatment hypoxia (dashed square 3 in Fig. 5A
and 5B-k~o), there were de novo hypoxic cells (EF5+)
around original hypoxic cells (pimonidazole+), but no
CA9 expression.
In addition, it was also found that the differences
in the microvasculature structures and the heterogeneous
distribution of pretreatment hypoxia led to the significant
diverse effect of bortezomib (Fig. 5B). In the mild hypoxia
regions, the majority of the micro-vessels (CD31+)
were relative large and formed with discernible lumen
(Fig. 5B-e). In the contrary, the microvasculature was
mainly in dot or short line shape without discernible lumen
formation in the moderate (Fig. 5B-j) and severe hypoxic
regions (Fig. 5B-o). The apoptosis signals were found
preferentially located in moderate and severe pretreatment
hypoxic regions. The CCP-3 positive percentage in
these regions was 7.54% ± 1.31% and 7.92% ± 1.12%,
respectively, higher than that in mild hypoxic regions
(1.08% ± 0.32%), p < 0.001. The apoptosis was found both
in tumor cells (2.57% ± 0.64% and 2.63% ± 0.59%, solid
circles) and endothelial cells (4.97% ± 1.53% and 5.29% ±
1.48%, arrows) in moderate and severe hypoxic regions,
respectively. However, there were only CCP3 positive
signal in endothelial cells (1.08% ± 0.32%, arrows), but not
in tumor cells (dashed circle) in the mild hypoxia region.

pseudo color were shown for each treatment arm in
Fig.  6B. The Akep maps show that vascular perfusion
can be evaluated and is spatially heterogeneous at the
baseline DCE MRI. There was no discernible change
in vascular flow/perfusion in the control tumor group
over the time interval (n = 6). In the single-dose group
(n = 8), the tumor vascularity was dramatically reduced
in both center and peripheral tumor regions at 24 h, and
slightly recovered from the periphery to the center at
48 h. However, in the two-dose group (n = 8), the tumor
blood flow and permeability was continuously decreased
in both peripheral and central regions at 24 h and 48 h
after the bortezomib administration. Representative
buildup time-signal intensity curves from single tumor
voxels at the baseline, 24 h, and 48 h after treatments for
each group are displayed in Fig. 6C. In the control group
(n = 6), there were no significant changes in the initial
slopes (Akep) of the curves at 24 h and 48 h compared
to the baseline curve, suggesting no significant change
in local blood flow and permeability. However, in the
single- and two-dose groups, Akep of the 24 h and 48 h
curves were lower than those at baseline, suggesting that
the local blood flow and permeability decreased posttreatment.
The dynamic changes in average tumor blood flow
and permeability (whole-tumor median Akep values)
were shown in Fig. 6D. To eliminate the bias from intertumoral heterogeneous baseline vascular blood flow and
permeability, baseline whole-tumor Akep values were
pooled from all three groups to evaluate vascular changes
in response to bortezomib treatment. It was found that
the average whole-tumor median Akep values were
significantly reduced from 0.072 ± 0.018/min at baseline
(n = 22) to 0.018 ± 0.010/min at 24 h and recovered at
48 h (0.068 ± 0.017/min) after single-dose bortezomib
treatments (gray bars, n = 8), and continuously decreased
at 24 h (0.037 ± 0.014/min) and 48 h (0.022 ± 0.010/min)

DISCUSSIONS

DCE MRI could indirectly reflect the biological
effect of bortezomib

As bortezomib is still in early phase of clinical trail
for treating solid tumors, it is key to clarify its critical
biological effects and mechanism and select the patients
responsive to the treatment. In the present study, we found
that the pretreatment tumor hypoxia microenvironment
plays a critical role in the effects of bortezomib. Higher
apoptotic indexes were found in the endothelial cells and
tumor cells in severe hypoxic regions, which were closely
related to the inhibition/reduction of tumor hypoxia
response. Noninvasive DCE MRI could effectively monitor
the changes in tumor vascularity, linked to tumor hypoxia
[18], reflecting the biological effects of bortezomib. Our
data thus support, that the an early response to bortezomib
treatment may have the potential to select patients who
would most benefit from bortezomib treatment and
establish a rational scheme for successful targeted therapy.
The hypoxia pathway targeting effect of bortezomib
has been studied previously in different models [12, 15,
19–21]. In vitro and in vivo data showed that bortezomib
protected HIF-1α from proteasome degradation and

Ex vivo data validated that the effects of bortezomib
on tumor vascularity paralleled its effect on the tumor
hypoxia response (Fig. 7). The effect of bortezomib on
tumor perfusion (Hoechst 33342) was similar to the
effects on in vivo tumor blood flow and permeability as
assessed by DCE MRI. Similar results were obtained
when evaluating the extent of hypoxic areas in the tumor
at two time points ex vivo by immunohistochemistry of
pimonidazole and imaging of eGFP (data not shown). The
distribution of Hoechst 33342 at 50 h after single-dose
bortezomib treatments was observed in both central and
peripheral tumor regions (Fig. 7B), which suggested that
the effect of bortezomib on tumor perfusion has vanished
or decreased. In the two-dose group, tumor perfusion was
significantly decreased with only Hoechst 33342 detected
in the peripheral regions (Fig. 7C). In addition, the effect
of bortezomib on tumor hypoxia response (CA9) was
similar as its effects on tumor blood flow and permeability.

impaired its function in cervical cancer [12]. Biphasic
effects of proteasome inhibitors on the stability of
HIF-1α have been also found [20]. Fels et al. found
that bortezomib exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity
toward hypoxic than normoxic tumor cells, which was
accompanied by enhanced activation of an unfolded
protein response [15]. In present study, it was found that
the effect of bortezomib was dependent on the status of
pretreatment tumor hypoxia, as assessed by the analysis of
multiparametric ex vivo images (Fig. 4). The cytotoxicity
of bortezomib toward tumor cells only occurred in areas
that were, at pretreatment, moderately to severely hypoxic.
It could be closely related to bortezomib’s inhibitory
effect on the tumor hypoxia response. Apoptosis was
only activated in hypoxic tumor areas without associated
expression of CA9, a protein expressed downstream of
the primary hypoxia response characterized by HIF-1
stabilization. In addition, it was also found that spatial
microvascular heterogeneity and the heterogeneous
distribution of pretreatment hypoxia were associated with
a significant and equal spatially diverse inhibitory effect of
bortezomib on the hypoxia response (Fig. 5). Therefore, it
is worth to further explore the dual antitumor mechanism
of bortezomib in solid tumor, although clinical data
showed that solid tumors of various histological origins
were resistant to either bortezomib as single treatment
or in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy
[6–9]. Our data suggest that preexisting hypoxia plays
an important role in antitumor efficacy of bortezomib,
and that the inhibition or reduction of the HIF-1 hypoxia
response pathway promotes apoptosis in hypoxic
tumor cells.
More importantly, our study demonstrated that
pretreatment hypoxia also plays a critical role in the effects
of bortezomib on the tumor vasculature. Tumor endothelial
cells within poorly developed microvasculature were more
sensitive to bortezomib than tumor cells, accounting for
~62.35% of the apoptotic population (Figs. 2 and 5).
Previous in vitro experiments found that endothelial cells
exposed to bortezomib undergo death to an extent that
depends strictly on their activation state [22]. Endothelial
cells under hypoxic condition or actively proliferating
are sensitive to bortezomib, which activates autophagy
or apoptosis [16, 22]. Preexposing endothelial cells to
hypoxia to induce the expression of HIF-1α protein, will
greatly enhance the proapoptotic effect of bortezomib
[16, 22, 23]. Bone marrow angiogenesis is emerging as
a critical component of multiple myeloma development
and progression, and hence, provides an attractive
therapeutic target for the disease [24]. Bortezomib has
shown antiangiogenic properties in multiple myeloma
via direct and indirect effects on endothelia cells [25].
When HUVECs were induced to express HIF-1α prior
to bortezomib treatment in vitro, proliferative and
angiogenic responses were abolished, and a greatly

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhanced proapoptotic effect was promoted [23]. These
results indicate that HIF-1α up-regulation may sensitize
endothelial cells to the antiangiogenic and proapoptotic
effects of bortezomib and explain the histological findings
in the current study.
As bortezomib induced apoptosis in tumor
endothelial cells, it led to the collapse of corresponding
vessel functionality, and significantly decreased localized
and overall tumor vascularity. This was demonstrated by
both ex vivo imaging of tumor sections (Figs. 5 and 7) and
in vivo DCE MRI (Fig. 6). It was found that the inhibition
of tumor microcirculation by bortezomib was synchronized
with its inhibitory effect on hypoxia response (as assessed
by decreased expression of eGFP and CA9). When tumor
vascularity was decreased by bortezomib, the hypoxia
response was also reduced, and vice versa. Therefore,
using DCE MRI to monitor the effect of bortezomib on
tumor vascularity could effectively reflect its biological
effects on the histological level. It provides thus a potent
clinical tool to early and noninvasively select patients
responsive to bortezomib treatment and establish a rational
scheme for combining bortezomib with other therapeutic
approaches. Preclinically, DCE MRI has been used
extensively as a noninvasive tool to assess tumor blood
perfusion and predict treatment response [26, 27]. Using
DCE MRI and high-resolution computed tomographic
imaging of vascular casts, the vasculature of xenograft
tumors has been characterized and prominent differences
in vessel perfusion, permeability, and architechture have
been identified and ultimately resulted in optimizing
bortezomib exposure to improve treatment efficacy [28].
Clinically, DCE MRI has been used in early clinical
development of vascular directed anticancer therapies over
the last decade and has been proven helpful in assessing
whether mechanistic goals are achieved, in assisting
dose selection, in selecting subpopulations enriched for
response and in predicting patient benefit [29].
In summary, the present study revealed that
bortezomib significantly inhibited the hypoxia response
pathway in tumors and reduced tumor vascular blood flow
and permeability. Our results emphasize the importance
of determining the spatial extent and heterogeneity of
hypoxia and tumor vascularity pre- and during treatment
for translational studies. Although limited by small
sample size, (12 of 91 patients were observed), DCE
MRI has already been employed in a recently reported
phase I study, treating advanced, refractory malignancies
with a combination of bortezomib plus anti-angiogenic
therapy (bevacizumab) [30]. Additionally, a phase I/II
study to evaluate efficacy and safety of using bortezomib
in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab as
the first-line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung
cancer has also been conducted recently in patients [31].
Our results, together with other clinical and preclinical
studies together, demonstrate the significant advantages

Animal Care and Use Committee. HT29–9HRE xenografts
were formed by injecting 5 × 106 cells s.c. into the hind limbs
or the right flank (for DCE MRI) of 6–8 weeks old female
nude mice (NCr athymic nu/nu, National Cancer Institute
Frederick Cancer Research Institute). Unless indicated
otherwise, nude mice, bearing HT29–9HRE xenografts,
were injected i.v. with the first hypoxia marker pimonidazole
(80 mg/kg), 2 h later injected i.p. with bortezomib (2 mg/kg)
or PBS, 20 h later injected i.v. with the second hypoxia
marker EF5 (24 mg/kg), and 4  h later injected i.v. with
perfusion marker Hoechst 33342 (25 mg/kg), followed
1 min later by animal sacrifice. Immediately after sacrifice,
tumor tissue was excised, frozen, and embedded in optimalcutting-temperature medium (OCT). Contiguous frozen
tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 8 μm and stored
at –80°C. The experimental flowchart was shown in Fig. 3.

Immunohistochemical staining, fluorescence
microscopy, and image analysis
Whole tumor sections were scanned using an
Axiovert 200M Inverted fluorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), equipped with a
computer-controlled motorized stage, a digital camera,
and Metamorph software. All images were acquired at
50× magnification, unless indicated otherwise. Composite
images were generated from individual microscope images
using the software. Sections were first imaged for eGFP and
Hoechst 33342. Then the same or adjacent sections were
stained for HIF-1α, pimonidazole, EF5, CA9, CD31, SMA
and CCP3 according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and imaged at the appropriate wavelength for green and red
fluorescence, respectively. Lastly, the sections were stained
with H&E according to standard protocol.
The analysis included the entire viable tumor area
identified on the H&E slide. The images were carefully
adjusted and analyzed by Adobe Photoshop 7.0. For each
image, the threshold was set individually at a brightness
level that best separated the signal from the background.
Based on the threshold images, the percentages of positive
stained area were measured for each marker.

Cell culture
Human colorectal carcinoma HT29 and LoVo cells
were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium or Dulbecco’s
Modified Essential Medium (DMEM), respectively,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics
at 37°C and 5% CO2 in humidified air. Previously
developed HT29 cells, carrying a 9 hypoxia-response
elements (9HRE) driven HSV1-TK/eGFP (designated as
HT29–9HRE), were maintained as described previously
[32]. Stable hypoxia-inducible gene expression in
HT29–9HRE cells was periodically tested by PCR and
flow cytometry. Cells for experiments were obtained from
recently thawed vials and used below passage 10.

In vitro response to bortezomib
HT29–9HRE cells were treated at 37°C with
bortezomib at indicated concentrations and exposed to
0.2% O2, 5% CO2, 94.8% N2 (hypoxia) in an In vivo 2-400
Hypoxia Workstation (Biotrace, Bridgend, UK) or
maintained in humidified air containing 5% CO2 for 24 h.
Cell lysates were prepared for western blot (HIF-1α and
CA9), which was performed using a Sally Simple Western

Dynamic contrast enhanced 1H MRI (DCE MRI)
DCE MRI was performed on a Bruker 7T BioSpin
MR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with a home-built,
34742

Oncotarget

solenoid 1H MR coil. Sagittal slices of interest were
identified from a pilot MR scan. The mouse tail vein
was catheterized to facilitate administration of the MR
contrast agent Gd-DTPA (0.1 mM Gd/kg, Magnevist®,
Berlex Laboratories, Wayne, NJ). The mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane (0.8%–1.5%) in oxygen
(1.5 ml/min) with respiration monitored. T1-weighted
DCE MRI (Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) MRI, 4 slices,
1 mm slice thickness, 1 average (number of averages,
NA), 312 repetitions (number of repetitions, NR),
3.2 ms echo time (TE), 34 ms repetition interval (TR),
128 × 128 matrix, 15 mm × 15 mm field of view (FOV),
~45° flip angle, 22 min acquisition time) was performed
at 4.3 s temporal resolution and 117 μm × 117 μm
in-plane resolution.
After the baseline DCE MRI, the animals were
randomly assigned into three groups: 1) control (PBS), 2)
1-dose bortezomib (2.0 mg/kg), or 3) 2-dose bortezomib
(1.5 mg/kg administered 24 h apart). Each animal
underwent three sequential DCE MRI experiments
(day 0, 1, and 2) with spin density MR images facilitating
the tumor slice alignment of the baseline DCE MRI and
with the subsequent DCE MRI performed at 24 h and 48 h
later. The time-signal curves, obtained by DCE MRI, were
normalized with respect to the data without contrast agent
and fitted voxel-by-voxel using the Hoffman model
[18, 34]. Akep maps were generated for the corresponding
tumor slices for all 3 time points. To quantify the
perfusion (tumor blood flow and permeability) changes
due to bortezomib treatments, the median Akep value
of each tumor was calculated from whole-tumor Akep
histograms.
Each tumor was measured daily with a digital
caliper in three orthogonal dimensions (a, b and c).
Tumor volume was calculated as πabc/6 and compared
between groups. For ex vivo evaluation of hypoxia and
perfusion changes in response to treatment, mice were
injected i.v. with pimonidazole after the last DCE MRI,
2 h later injected i.v. with Hoechst 33342, and 1 min
later sacrificed. Histological analysis was performed
as described above and compared with the DCE MRI
results.
