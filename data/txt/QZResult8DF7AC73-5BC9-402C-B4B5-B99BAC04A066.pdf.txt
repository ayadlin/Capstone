Abstract
Serotonin, a neurotransmitter with numerous functions in the
central nervous system (CNS), is emerging as an important
signaling molecule in biological processes outside of the CNS.
Recent advances have implicated serotonin as a regulator of
inflammation, proliferation, regeneration, and repair. The
role of serotonin in tumor biology in vivo has not been
elucidated. Using a genetic model of serotonin deficiency
(Tph1 / ) in mice, we show serotonin to be crucial for the
growth of s.c. colon cancer allografts in vivo. Serotonin does
not enhance tumor cell proliferation but acts as a regulator of
angiogenesis by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) in tumor-infiltrating macrophages,
entailing lower levels of angiostatin—an endogenous inhibitor
of angiogenesis. Accordingly, serotonin deficiency causes
slower growth of s.c. tumors by reducing vascularity, thus
increasing hypoxia and spontaneous necrosis. The biological
relevance of these effects is underscored by the reconstitution
of serotonin synthesis in Tph1 / mice, which restores allograft phenotype in all aspects. In conclusion, we show how
serotonin regulates angiogenesis in s.c. colon cancer allografts
by influencing MMP-12 expression in tumor-infiltrating
macrophages, thereby affecting the production of circulating
angiostatin. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5152–8]

Introduction
Serotonin is a biogenic amine widely appreciated as a neurotransmitter with numerous functions in the central nervous system
(CNS). In addition to its classic functions in intestinal motility, fluid
secretion, and blood flow (1), serotonin is emerging as a key
mediator of different biological processes in peripheral organ
systems. Serotonin confers its biological functions in a receptordependent (2) or receptor-independent manner (3). To date, 7
classes including 14 subtypes of serotonin receptors (HTR) have
been identified (4). Depending on the receptor involved, serotonin
can act as a cellular mitogen, e.g., in fibroblasts (5), smooth muscle
(6), and endothelial cells (7). Recent advances have implicated
serotonin as a regulator of inflammation (8), proliferation (9),
regeneration (2), and repair (10).

Colorectal cancer remains the third most common malignancy
in Western societies, predicted to cause 50,000 deaths during
2006 in the US (11). Although chemotherapeutic compounds and
protocols have seen steady improvements over the last decades,
chemotherapy is still fraught with side effects and long-term
treatment failure. This inadequacy drives continuing research to
identify new classes of antineoplastic compounds, such as
inhibitors of angiogenesis (12).
The few experimental studies to have analyzed the role of
serotonin in tumor biology were limited to in vitro analyses of
mitogenic effects on malignant cells, such as lung (13) or head and
neck cancer (14). Accordingly, antagonists for serotonin receptors
1A and 1B reduced the proliferation rate of bladder cancer cells
in vitro (15). However, in vivo studies investigating the function of
serotonin in cancer growth and progression are lacking.
Interestingly, a recent population-based study showed a high
intake of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) to correlate
with a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer (16). This observation suggests a biological relevance of serotonin for colorectal
cancer growth in vivo. On these grounds, we decided to investigate
the function of serotonin in the growth of colon cancer, using a
unique genetic model of peripheral serotonin deficiency in mice.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and in vitro experiments. The mouse colon cancer cell
line MC-38, generated in C57BL/6 mice (17), was a kind gift of Carole
Bourquin (Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Germany). The CT-26
(mouse colon carcinoma) and LLC1 (mouse Lewis lung carcinoma) cell
lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse
peritoneal macrophages were isolated by peritoneal lavage with 0.9% NaCl
and subsequent centrifugation at 200 g. MC-38, LLC1, and peritoneal
macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium
(Invitrogen), whereas CT-26 were cultured in RPMI Medium (Invitrogen).
Culture medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA
Laboratories), with the addition of 100 units/mL of penicillin and
100 Ag/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen) for MC-38, CT-26, and LLC1. Cells
were maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded into
12-well plates at a density of f50% corresponding to 5  105 cells per well
and allowed to adhere overnight, before the medium was changed to the
specified conditions, containing different concentrations of serotonin creatinine complex (Sigma Aldrich). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed as previously described (18).
Animal experiments. All animal experiments were in accordance with
Swiss federal animal regulations and approved by the cantonal veterinary
office of Zurich. Mice ages 8 to 12 wk were kept on a 12-h day/night cycle
with free access to food and water. Strains used were C57BL/6 (Harlan) and
Tph1 / on a C57BL/6 background (own breeding). As previously described
(19), these mice have a disrupted gene for tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and
therefore lack serotonin outside of the CNS. For tumor cell inoculations,
MC-38 and LLC1 cultured at exponential growth rate were trypsinized
(Invitrogen), washed in PBS, and resuspended in serum-free medium at a
concentration of 2.5  106  mL 1, before injecting 500,000 cells s.c. Tumor

growth was monitored daily with a sliding caliper and the volume was
calculated according to the ellipsoid formula 4/3k  l/2  w/2  w/2,
where l is the length and w the width. Serotonin receptor agonists and
antagonists were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and administered once daily
by s.c. injection in 200 AL NaCl commencing 2 d before tumor inoculation,
whereas controls received NaCl. Substances used were 2,5-Dimethoxy-4iodoamphetamine (DOI; 1 and 10 mg/kg), methysergide (3 and 30 mg/kg),
quipazine (3 and 30 mg/kg), and ketanserine (3 and 30 mg/kg). Reloading
with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (Sigma Aldrich) was
performed by twice daily s.c. injections of 50 mg/kg in 200 AL NaCl,
commencing 2 d before tumor inoculation, whereas controls received NaCl.
Histologic examination. Tumor tissue was immersion-fixed in 4% PBSbuffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&E
using standard histologic techniques. In addition, slides were immunostained for Ki-67 (monoclonal rabbit clone SP6; NeoMarkers), CD31 (goat
polyclonal; M20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GLUT-1 (rabbit polyclonal;
MYM AB 1351; Chemicon International), and F4/80 (rat monoclonal; T-2006;
BMA Biomedicals). Ki-67 and GLUT-1 (20) staining procedures were
performed on a Benchmark immunohistochemistry staining system
(Ventana Medical Systems). For CD31 staining, detection of primary
antibody was performed with a Histofine staining kit (Nichirei Corporation)
and 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. All immunostains were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Necrotic tumor area was assessed on
one transection per tumor (magnification, 40) by means of a semiautomatic image analysis system (Saisam, version 4.2.2; Microvision Instruments) and expressed as percent of tumor surface. Microvascular density of
each CD31 stained tumor was counted in 10 random high-power fields
(400) by two investigators blinded with respect to the experimental group.
Mitotic figures and Ki-67 positive nuclei were quantified as previously
described (21).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of
tumor tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extraction from peritoneal macrophages
was performed using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Five micrograms of RNA were reverse
transcribed using ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
System (Invitrogen) yielding the cDNA template. Quantitative real-time
PCR amplification and data analysis were performed using an ABI
Prism 7000 Sequence Detector System (PE Applied Biosystems). Taq
Man gene expression assays (PE Applied Biosystems) for Htr1a
(Mm00434106_s1), Htr1b (Mm00439377_s1), Htr2a (Mm00555764_m1),
Htr2b (Mm00434123_m1), Htr2c (Mm00434127_m1), Mmp-2
(Mm00439508_m1), Mmp-7 (Mm00487724_m1), Mmp-9
(Mm00442991_m1), and Mmp-12 (Mm00500554_m1) were used to quantify
mRNA expression of the respective genes. Messenger RNA expression levels
of each sample were normalized to 18S RNA (Taq Man rRNA control
reagents; PE Applied Biosystems). Results of in vivo experiments represent
fold induction of mRNA compared with tumors of wild-type animals at 7 d,
whereas results of in vitro experiments represent fold induction of mRNA
compared with untreated macrophages.
Western blotting. Tumor protein extracts or serum samples were
diluted in sample buffer [187.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30%
glycerol, 150 mmol/L DTT, and 0.3% bromophenol blue] and boiled for
10 min at 90jC. One hundred micrograms of protein were loaded, SDSPAGE was performed, and samples were blotted onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti–
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 12 (ab39876; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal
anti-angiostatin (NB 300-544; Novus Biologicals), and rabbit polyclonal antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; ab9485; Abcam).
Secondary staining and detection was performed according to standard
protocols with the ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare Ltd).
Statistical analysis. Data are given as mean F SD or mean F 95%
confidence interval (CI) as indicated. Student’s t test was used to compare
means in experiments with two groups. ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD for
post hoc comparisons was used to compare means in experiments with
three groups. The level of statistical significance was set at below 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 14.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Serotonin deficiency decreases the growth of colon cancer
allografts in vivo. We first investigated the effect of serotonin on
the proliferation of the two different mouse colon cancer cell lines
CT-26 and MC-38 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Dose escalation over six
log scales showed a marked increase of proliferative activity at
serotonin concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mmol/L. To establish
whether serotonin affects colon cancer cell proliferation in vivo, we
used Tph1 / mice, which have a disrupted gene for tryptophan
hydroxylase 1 and, therefore, lack serotonin outside the CNS (19),
and the MC-38 colon cancer cell line, which is syngeneic with the
C57BL/6 background (17). In mice lacking peripheral serotonin, the
establishment and early growth of s.c. tumor allografts up to 6 days
after injection was the same as in controls. However, allograft
growth from day 7 onwards was significantly slower in Tph1 /
mice, leading to significantly lower tumor volume after 14 d
(Fig. 1A). This implicates serotonin as a key mediator of the growth
of colon carcinoma allografts in vivo.
Reconstitution of serotonin synthesis restores tumor allograft growth. To substantiate whether the impaired tumor
allograft growth in Tph1 / mice was in fact caused by the lack
of serotonin, we restored serotonin synthesis in Tph1 / mice by
the administration of 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, the product of TPH1
(reloading). As shown in Fig. 1B, reloading of serotonin-deficient
animals restored tumor allograft growth to the levels observed in
wild-type animals. We then assessed whether the growthstimulating effect of serotonin is mediated by a receptor-dependent
pathway. Serotonin receptors 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 2C have been
shown to influence proliferative activity outside the CNS (2, 9).
Therefore we first analyzed the role of serotonin receptors in vivo
with well-described serotonin receptor agonists (methysergide for
HTR1; DOI for HTR2), with the aim to ‘‘rescue’’ tumor growth in
Tph1 / animals. As shown in Fig. 1C, neither methysergide nor
DOI increased tumor growth. As a next step, serotonin receptor
antagonists targeting the same receptors were evaluated for their
potential to decrease tumor growth in wild-type mice (quipazine
for 5HTR1; ketanserine for HTR2). Again, neither substance showed
a significant effect on tumor allograft growth (Fig. 1D). Because
quipazine and ketanserine seemed to slightly decrease tumor
allograft growth, we repeated all antagonist and agonist experiments with a 10-fold dosage increase. Even at this dose, neither
substance significantly affected tumor allograft growth (data not
shown). Our results implicate serotonin as a mediator of tumor
growth in s.c. colon cancer grafts via a receptor-independent
mechanism.
Serotonin deficiency reduces angiogenesis in s.c. colon
cancer allografts. As serotonin increased tumor cell proliferation
in vitro, proliferative activity was assessed in our model of colon
cancer. Neither the mitotic index (data not shown) nor Ki67
labeling index (Fig. 2A) showed any significant difference between
tumors allografts growing in wild-type, Tph1 / , and reloaded
animals. Interestingly, on H&E-stained sections, we observed a
prominent degree of tumor necroses in Tph1 / animals.
Quantification of necrotic tumor area revealed significantly larger
areas of necroses in Tph1 / mice, which was fully reversible when
serotonin synthesis was reconstituted (Fig. 2B). To test whether the
higher level of spontaneous tumor necroses in Tph1 / mice was
associated with tumor hypoxia, we performed GLUT1 immunostaining. In line with increased necrosis, tumors growing in
serotonin-deficient mice displayed strikingly more hypoxic tumor
area (Fig. 2D) than tumors growing in wild-type animals (Fig. 2C).

D, treatment of wild-type animals with class 1 and 2 serotonin receptor antagonists did not affect tumor allograft growth. Points, mean of 10 animals; bars, CI.

The reduced oxygen status in these tumors prompted us to
investigate whether this was related to insufficient tumor
vascularization in mice lacking peripheral serotonin. Indeed,
serotonin deficiency entailed a significant reduction of microvascular density as assessed by CD31 immunostaining compared with
wild-type animals (Fig. 3). Of note, reloading ameliorated tumor
vascularization. These experiments provide evidence that serotonin
modulates tumor allograft growth in vivo by regulating tumor
vascularization.
Serotonin deficiency reduces angiogenesis by MMP-12 upregulation and consecutive angiostatin activation. To further
elucidate the mechanism of differential growth between allografts
growing with and without serotonin, we stained for possible
infiltrating inflammatory cells. Although neutrophils as well as B
and T lymphocytes were scant (data not shown), macrophages
were found to be the predominant infiltrating cell population
(Fig. 4A). Tumor-infiltrating macrophages are known to secrete
MMP-12 (22), a key enzyme for the conversion of plasminogen to
angiostatin, which acts as an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis.
Allograft transcript levels of all MMPs able to cleave plasminogen
into angiostatin (MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-12) were
analyzed by RT-PCR. Transcripts for MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9
were barely detectable in allografts, whereas MMP-12 expression
was well-detectable in all tumor-bearing mice, in line with the
presence of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. To rule out an
epiphenomenon, we also investigated transcript levels of vascular

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor, which were
not different. Transcript levels of MMP-12 were significantly higher
in tumors allografts growing in serotonin-deficient mice at 7 and
14 days after tumor cell injection, whereas serotonin reloading
reduced MMP-12 expression to wild-type levels (Fig. 4B). Because
this effect was not due to a difference in the quantity of tumor
infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 4C), MMP-12 expression was
analyzed in peritoneal macrophages in vitro in response to
serotonin exposure. Interestingly, serotonin suppressed the expression of MMP-12 by >25% at nanomolar concentrations compared
with baseline (Fig. 4D).
To test whether serotonin would also affect protein levels of
MMP-12 in vivo, we performed Western blot analyses of tumor
allografts growing in Tph1 / and wild-type mice using a
commercially available antibody directed against proMMP-12. As
indicated in Fig. 5A, protein levels of proMMP-12 were significantly
lower in allografts of serotonin-deficient animals, pointing to a
higher conversion into the active form. Again, reloading restituted
the wild-type phenotype. Higher MMP-12 transcripts paired with
lower protein proform levels point to the presence of more active
MMP-12. MMP-12 mediates the cleavage of circulating plasminogen into angiostatin. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, higher MMP-12
activity in tumor-bearing Tph1 / animals led to higher levels
of circulating angiostatin, which could be restored to wild-type
levels by reloading. Of note, baseline levels of naı̈ve wild-type and
Tph1 / were not different. These results suggest serotonin to

confer its effects on colon cancer growth through a regulation of
MMP-12/angiostatin pathway.
Serotonin deficiency decreases Lewis lung cancer allograft
growth in vivo by reducing angiogenesis. The previous in vivo
experiments were conducted in a model of s.c. colon cancer
allografts. To rule out a cell line–specific effect of serotonin on
tumor allograft growth, we repeated the growth experiments using
the Lewis lung carcinoma. This cell line was chosen because its
growth in vivo is strongly regulated by macrophage-derived

MMP12 signaling (23). As shown in Fig. 6A, Lewis lung carcinoma
allografts grew significantly slower in mice lacking peripheral
serotonin. In line with the observed effects in colon cancer, Lewis
lung cancer allografts growing in Tph1 / mice showed significantly higher degree of tumor necrosis as well as significantly lower
microvascular density (Fig. 6B and C). Taken together, serotonin
emerges as a positive regulator of angiogenesis in models of s.c.
tumor growth by suppressing MMP-12 expression in macrophages,
thus inhibiting the production of angiostatin.

Discussion
This study unveils a novel function of serotonin as a mediator of
angiogenesis in colon cancer allografts. Using a unique genetic model
of peripheral serotonin deficiency, we provide evidence that the lack
of serotonin causes a reduction of tumor growth by the up-regulation
of MMP-12 in macrophages, leading to higher levels of circulating
angiostatin, an established endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis.
Serotonin was previously shown to be mitogenic in different cancer
cell lines (13–15). In line with these reports, colon cancer cell lines
CT-26 and MC-38 showed increased proliferative activity when
exposed to serotonin in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that tumors
growing in mice lacking peripheral serotonin would display reduced

growth due to a lack of serotonin-induced proliferation. Although
tumor growth was significantly impaired in Tph1 / animals, this
effect could not be explained by a reduction of proliferative activity.
Of note, tumor engraftment and early growth (up to 6 days) were
identical, speaking against an influence of minor strain differences or
immunologic factors. Autocrine stimulation was excluded by negative
serotonin immunostaining of tumors (data not shown). Additionally,
specific effects related to the heterotopic tumor localization are
unlikely as serotonin is predominantly stored and distributed to all
organ systems in platelets (2, 10). However, the widely used model of
s.c. colon cancer allografts does not reproduce all aspects of tumor
biology.

In contrast to our previous work in liver regeneration (2),
serotonin-derived effects on tumor growth could not be attributed
to the activation of serotonin receptors 5HTR1 or 5HTR2. It is
conceivable but unlikely that another member of the serotonin
receptor family is involved in this process because those receptors
have almost exclusively been described in the CNS. A receptorindependent pathway (3) is the most likely mechanism. This might
also offer an explanation for the reduction of human colorectal
cancer incidence by SSRIs (16), as these reduce the uptake of
serotonin into colonic enterocytes.
Decreased tumor growth in Tph1 / mice could not be
explained by reduced tumor cell proliferation. Histologic analyses
revealed dramatically larger areas of spontaneous necroses and
tissue hypoxia in mice lacking peripheral serotonin, which could be
attributed to diminished tumor vascularity pointing to a disturbed
angiogenesis in these animals. This explains the apparently
divergent effects of serotonin in vitro and in vivo because tumor

growth in vivo is not only affected by tumor cell proliferation but
also by stroma-related factors such as angiogenesis. In our model,
these stroma-related effects of serotonin seem to be more
important than the direct mitogenic actions.
Tumor-infiltrating macrophages are associated with tumor
progression and metastasis. They were reported to regulate
angiogenesis in breast (24) as well as lung cancer and melanoma
(23). Macrophages are known to specifically secrete MMP-12,
which leads to enhanced generation of angiostatin (22) and thereby
suppresses tumor growth by halting angiogenesis (23, 25).
Interestingly, transfection of the Mmp-12 gene into the colon
cancer cell line CT-26 suppressed tumor angiogenesis and tumor
growth (26). As macrophages were the predominant infiltrating
cells in our experiments and their number did not differ between
groups, we asked whether there might be functional differences.
Indeed, mRNA levels of MMP-12 were higher in serotonin-deficient
tumor allografts, whereas protein levels of proMMP-12 were lower.
Both alterations could be restored by reloading. These data suggest
serotonin to suppress MMP-12 production in macrophages, which
could be confirmed by exposing peritoneal macrophages to
different concentrations of serotonin.
MMP-12 cleaves plasminogen into angiostatin, which suppresses
angiogenesis in solid tumors. In line with previous reports (23, 27),
enhanced transcription and activation of MMP-12 observed in
tumors of serotonin-deficient mice entailed higher levels of
circulating angiostatin, causing a reduction of tumor vascularity,
enhanced hypoxia, and consequently, tumor necrosis. Serotonindependent effects were reproducible in Lewis lung cancer, in accordance with previous studies showing supranormal serotonin levels
to enhance lung cancer proliferation (13, 28) and macrophagederived MMP-12 to regulate Lewis lung cancer growth (23, 27).
In conclusion, we show how serotonin regulates angiogenesis in
s.c. colon cancer allografts by influencing MMP-12 expression in
tumor-infiltrating macrophages, thereby affecting the production
of circulating angiostatin. Hence, serotonin might represent a novel
target for the prevention and treatment of colon cancer, especially
as numerous safe and effective serotonin-targeting drugs are in
clinical use today.
