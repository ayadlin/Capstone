BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for locally advanced superior sulcus tumors is not clear. The authors report
long-term results of a trial examining the safety and efficacy of surgery followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy for this disease. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with resectable or marginally resectable superior sulcus tumors
at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1994 to 2010 were enrolled in a prospective trial. Surgery involved segmentectomy or lobectomy with en bloc resection of the involved chest wall and complete nodal
staging; radiation therapy (RT) began 14 to 42 days later to a dose of 60 grays (Gy) in 50 1.2-Gy fractions if surgical
margins were negative or 64.8 Gy in 54 1.2-Gy fractions if margins were positive. Two cycles of etoposide (50 mg/
m2) and cisplatin (50 mg/m2) were given during RT, and another 3 cycles were given after RT. Eleven patients underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 78%. Gross total resection
was accomplished in all 32 patients; 28% underwent R1 resection. Operative mortality was 0%. The most common surgical complication was postoperative pneumonia (25%). At a median follow-up time of 53.4 months (range, 2-154
months), the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year rates of locoregional control were 84%, 76%, and 76%; distant metastasisfree survival, 52%, 48%, and 48%; disease-free survival, 49%, 45%, and 45%; and overall survival, 72%, 50%, and 45%,
respectively. The brain was the most common site of distant failure (n ¼ 5), but no patient who received PCI experienced brain metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by postoperative chemoradiation is safe and effective for

Superior sulcus tumors represent a unique subset of nonsmall cell lung malignancies that have been described as early
as 1838.1 Over the past several decades, the treatment of superior sulcus tumors has evolved to become multimodal. In a
highly cited trial by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), patients with T3-T4N0-N1 superior sulcus tumors were
treated with preoperative cisplatin and etoposide and concurrent radiation to 45 grays (Gy), followed by thoracotomy for
disease that was stable or responsive to this treatment. Five-year survival rates were promising at 44% for the entire group
and >50% for cases in which a complete response was achieved.2,3 As a result, many have advocated preoperative chemoradiation, even for resectable superior sulcus tumors. However, no studies have established that preoperative chemotherapy, with or without radiation treatment, is superior to surgical resection followed by postoperative treatment in cases that
are resectable at diagnosis.
In this context, we initiated a prospective phase 2 study of patients with resectable superior sulcus tumors treated
with surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. Radiation was delivered in twice-daily fractions to minimize
long-term toxicity, which is particularly important as these tumors are often close to the brachial plexus, and to minimize
tumor-cell repair and repopulation between fractions.4 We report here the long-term results of this study, focusing on survival outcomes, failure patterns, and treatment complications, with the goal of establishing if this treatment approach is
safe and effective for this relatively rare but aggressive disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Table 1. Patient Characteristics

Eligibility
This pilot study (internal protocol ID 92-038) was
approved by the appropriate institutional review board of
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
and subjects were required to provide written informed
consent. Patient enrollment began in 1994 and ended in
2007. During this time period, 155 patients underwent
surgery for superior sulcus tumors at our institution, and
of these patients, 32 were enrolled in this trial. Eligible
patients had histologically confirmed, resectable or marginally resectable nonsmall cell carcinoma of the superior
sulcus. Reasons for exclusion from the protocol included
patient refusal and treatment before arriving at our institution, such as induction chemotherapy.
Patients were staged with a complete history and
physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scan
of the chest, mediastinal staging such as endobronchial
ultrasound or endoscopy, and positron emission tomography staging when it became commonly used for this disease in 2002. Superior sulcus tumors were defined as
tumors arising medially in the apex of the lung with or
without invasion into the thoracic ribs or vertebra such
that the central axis of the tumor was required to be at the
first rib or higher; tumors arising more laterally or chest
wall lesions not located in the superior sulcus were
excluded. Patients with American Joint Committee on
Cancer sixth edition stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIB malignancies
were eligible; patients with stage IIIA or IIIB disease were
eligible only if involvement of the vertebral bodies or mediastinum was considered resectable. Criteria for resectability was left at the discretion of the surgeons at our
institution, but included factors such as significant invasion into the spinal cord, nerve roots, brachial plexus, or
vertebral bodies such that gross total resection would place
the patient at a significant risk for high-grade neurologic
dysfunction. During the time period of our study, 81
patients with superior sulcus tumors were not candidates
for surgical resection and received radiation therapy for
curative intent.
All patients were evaluated for eligibility by multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts in radiation oncology, thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, and thoracic/
head and neck medical oncology before registration. All
eligible patients’ imaging studies and pathologic reports
were centrally reviewed at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center. All patients were required to
have a predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume
in 1 second of at least 1.0 L and arterial blood gases (on

Patients with impending cord compression were ineligible
for this study. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Treatment
Surgery

Patients first underwent surgery, which consisted of
a segmentectomy or lobectomy, with en bloc resection of
the involved chest wall at the discretion of the operating
surgeon. For cases in which vertebral involvement,
intraforaminal extension, or extensive brachial plexus
involvement was suspected, surgery was performed in
conjunction with a neurosurgical team. All patients
underwent complete nodal staging including lobar, hilar,
subcarinal, tracheobronchial angle, paratracheal, and subaortic nodal stations.
Radiation therapy

Radiation treatment began between 14 and 42 days
after surgery. The radiation dose depended on the surgical
outcome, being 60 Gy given in 50 fractions of 1.2 Gy
each over a course of 5 weeks for patients with negative
surgical margins and 64.8 Gy in 54 fractions for patients
with positive margins. Patients received radiation therapy
on a twice daily regimen. Patients with extranodal

445

Original Article

extension received 50 Gy in 1.2-Gy fractions in the absence of gross residual disease or positive margins.
The radiation technique consisted of opposed anteroposterior-posteroanterior fields and encompassed all
gross disease plus a margin of 2 cm as well as the bilateral
supraclavicular regions, the ipsilateral hilum, and the
entire mediastinum inferiorly to 5 cm below the carina. If
mediastinal lymphadenopathy was present, the contralateral hilum was also treated. After 50 Gy, off-cord oblique
fields were used to minimize the dose to the spinal cord.
An electron field was used when necessary to supplement
the supraclavicular field.
When the protocol was initially opened, prophylactic
cranial irradiation (PCI) at a dose of 25 Gy in 2.5-Gy fractions was required at the completion of chest irradiation.
However, this requirement was changed during enrollment
because of the lack of definitive evidence of its efficacy in
improving survival. Therefore, when the protocol was
closed, 11 patients had received PCI, and 21 had not.
Chemotherapy

During radiation therapy, patients were given 2 cycles
of oral etoposide at 50 mg/m2 daily on days 1 to 5 and 8 to
12 and bolus intravenous cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 on day 1.
The dosing schedule for etoposide (daily vs twice daily vs every other day) was determined by the patient’s body surface
area, with patients with greater body surface area receiving
more frequent doses. After chemoradiation therapy and
PCI (when applicable) had been completed, 3 more cycles
of the cisplatin and oral etoposide were given, at the same
dose, 1 cycle every 4 weeks.
Follow-Up and Reporting
Interval histories were taken and physical examinations
performed weekly during treatment, after each treatment
event, and at each follow-up visit. After completion of
therapy, patients were followed every 3 months for 2
years, every 6 months for 3 years, and yearly thereafter. A
chest x-ray and blood tests including a basic metabolic
panel and complete blood count were obtained at each
visit. Chest and upper abdomen CT, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scans were obtained every 6
months for 2 years and then yearly for a total of 5 years.
Additional images and blood tests were obtained at the
treating physician’s discretion.
Statistical Considerations
The primary study endpoint was locoregional control
(LRC). Secondary clinical endpoints were disease-free sur-

446

vival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival, and overall
survival (OS). For this phase 2 pilot study, it was calculated that 30 patients were needed to estimate local control and survival rates with a standard error of 10%.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate 5-year and
10-year estimates of LRC, DFS, distant metastasis-free
survival, and OS. All toxicity events occurring while
patients were on protocol were considered treatmentrelated unless a given event could be clearly shown to be
the result of tumor progression. Toxicity was scored
according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse
Events version 2.0.

RESULTS
Adherence to Treatment Regimen and
Surgical Results
Twenty-five patients (78%) completed the entire protocol
(surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), 6 only completed
surgery and radiation therapy, and 1 patient completed
surgery only. Gross total resection was accomplished in all
32 patients, R0 in 23 (72%), and R1 in 9 (28%). In terms
of pathologic classifications, 25 patients (78%) had T3
disease, and 7 (22%) had T4 disease; 25 patients (78%)
had N0, 4 (13%) had N1, 1 (3%) had N2, and 2 (6%)
had NX disease.
Disease Control and OS
At a median follow-up time of 53.4 months (range, 2-154
months), the LRC rates at 2, 5, and 10 years were 84%,
76%, and 76%, respectively; corresponding distant metastasis-free survival rates were 52%, 48%, and 48%; DFS
rates were 49%, 45%, and 45%; and OS rates were 72%,
50%, and 45%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown
in Figure 1. The median time to disease progression was
14.8 months (range, 0.8-153 months). Four patients
(13%) had experienced locoregional failure at last followup, and 14 patients (44%) had distant metastasis (DM).
Locoregional failures occurred in years 1997, 1999, 2003,
and 2007. Two additional patients were found to have a
presumed second lung malignancy. The first patient was
35 years old at diagnosis and 10 years later was found to
have contralateral disease with metastatic adenopathy and
multiple intracranial metastases. Because of the prolonged
time interval and the apparent origin in the contralateral
lung, this disease was considered a second malignancy
rather than a recurrence. The second patient was 60 years
old at diagnosis and approximately 2 years later developed
a tumor in the contralateral lung that was consistent with

a new primary tumor per pathology review at an outside
hospital. The patient received a second course of definitive
radiation to this region and then was lost to follow-up.
For the patients who experienced DM, the sites of
treatment failure were as follows, with some patients having failure in >1 site: brain (n ¼ 5), bone (n ¼ 4), adrenal
gland (n ¼ 4), contralateral lung (n ¼ 2), pleura (n ¼ 1),
and liver (n ¼ 1). None of the 11 patients who received
PCI had intracranial failure.
Surgical Toxicity
The most common surgical complication was postoperative pneumonia, experienced by 8 patients; 6 patients had
pneumothorax, 3 had atrial fibrillation, 2 had urinary
retention or bladder spasms, and 5 had other complications (1 dysesthesia, 1 empyema, 1 lung collapse, 1 vocal
cord paresis, and 1 wound infection). No patient died
from any surgical complication.

Chemoradiation Toxicity
Adverse events attributable to chemoradiation are shown
in Table 2. No patient experienced grade 5 toxicity. The
most common causes of severe (grade 3-4) chemoradiation-related toxicity were dysphagia (n ¼ 10), pneumonitis (n ¼ 1), lung fibrosis (n ¼ 1), leukopenia (n ¼ 2), and
granulocytopenia (n ¼ 3).

DISCUSSION
The current standard treatment for locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer is multimodal and includes surgery
(for those who are eligible), chemotherapy, and radiation
treatment. Although these modalities are the same as those
used for superior sulcus tumors, the general approach to
this subgroup of lung tumors has differed from that of primary lung malignancies at other sites, largely because
superior sulcus tumors often present with intractable pain
or neurologic symptoms resulting from involvement of

adjacent nerves or bony structures. Local progression of
disease in superior sulcus tumors can also lead to invasion
of the spinal canal with subsequent spinal cord compression. As a result, immediate local therapy is often
indicated.
Previous retrospective reports of surgical resection as
definitive local therapy for superior sulcus tumors demonstrated low rates of gross total resection, high rates of
locoregional relapse, and low rates of survival. Rusch et al,
reporting on 225 patients who underwent thoracotomy as
definitive treatment for T3 or T4 superior sulcus tumors
from 1974 to 1998 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, found that gross total resection could be achieved
in 50% to 60% of patients with T3 tumors and 40% of
patients with T4 tumors, with an operative mortality rate
of 0%. Five-year OS rates ranged from 46% for patients
with stage IIB tumors to 0% to 13% for patients with
stage IIIA or IIIB tumors.5
As a result of findings such as these, the Southwest
Oncology Group began a prospective trial in 1995 examining the role of preoperative chemoradiation (cisplatin
and etoposide with 45 Gy radiation) followed by surgical
resection for patients with T3-T4N0-N1 superior sulcus
tumors. Patients who responded or showed stable disease
after this induction therapy were offered definitive surgical resection. With this approach, 83 (75%) of 111
patients completed the entire treatment regimen; R0 was
possible for 75 patients (90%) and gross total resection
(R0 or R1) in 76 patients (92%). Or, put another way,
68% of initially enrolled patients were able to undergo
gross total resection.2 In the most recent update of this
trial, the 5-year survival rate was 44% for all patients; 17
patients (15%) experienced local relapse, 19 (17%) experienced brain-only relapse, and 19 (17%) experienced
relapse in other distant sites.3 A similar trial conducted by
the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG 9806)
involved a regimen of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (mitomy-

448

cin, vindesine, and cisplatin) with concurrent radiation
(45 Gy in 25 fractions delivered in a split-course fashion)
followed by surgical resection. In that trial, 75% of
patients completed the regimen, and the 5-year DFS and
OS rates were 45% and 56%, respectively.6 As a result of
these trials, preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgery (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) is the treatment currently recommended by the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network for patients
with marginally resectable or resectable N0 or N1 superior
sulcus tumors.7
The approach in the present prospective study was
different in that patients received surgical resection first,
followed by concurrent chemoradiation (up to 64.8 Gy,
given twice daily, with cisplatin and etoposide). If this
approach can produce high rates of R0/R1 resections with
acceptable morbidity, it has theoretical benefits over
induction chemoradiation. First, surgical resection may
provide more effective palliation of symptoms as well as
spinal decompression in cases involving neurologic compromise. Although we did not measure the efficacy of palliation as an endpoint in the current study, prior studies
have demonstrated that, particularly in cases of spinal
canal compromise, surgical decompression causes more
immediate relief of symptoms. For example, in a randomized trial by Patchell et al comparing decompressive surgical treatment followed by radiation therapy in the setting
of metastatic disease, the trial was stopped early because
an interim analysis demonstrated that patients who
received upfront surgery retained the ability to walk significantly longer than those patients receiving radiation
initially.8 Second, the preoperative chemoradiation dose
in the SWOG 9416 and JCOG 9806 regimens was relatively low, and thus an R1 or R2 resection may need to be
followed by further radiation—which would then be
delivered in a split-course fashion, a schedule that is suboptimal in terms of maximizing the probability of local

control. This latter concern has been addressed in more
recent reports of a more intensive preoperative regimen,
with preoperative radiation doses approaching 60 Gy
with acceptable toxicity.9,10
We have previously demonstrated retrospectively
that long-term survival can be achieved with superior sulcus tumors using a variety of approaches. The most common approach for resectable tumors was that of surgery
followed by radiation, with or without chemotherapy.
The 5-year survival rate of patients who underwent a gross
total resection in this study and received postoperative
radiation was 82%.11 Accordingly, we have now reported
the current prospective study and found that proceeding
from immediate surgical resection to postoperative chemoradiation produced rates of adherence to treatment,
operative mortality, R0 resections, LRC, and OS that
were analogous to those found after induction chemoradiation (Table 3). In addition to these similarities, the nature of the operative complications was similar in the 2
approaches, with several complications being common to
all studies: postoperative pneumonia, arrhythmias,
empyemas, and wound infections. The findings on operative morbidity and mortality are particularly significant
because in the current study, patients would be expected
to undergo more extensive surgery to treat disease that
had not been downsized by chemoradiation. Furthermore, we did not observe any brachial plexopathy after
radiation therapy despite >60 Gy being delivered to this
region, which we conclude can be attributed at least in
part to our use of a hyperfractionated regimen to minimize late radiation effects.
Other notable findings were that the rate of brain
metastases in our study (15%) was low compared with

Cancer

January 15, 2012

that of prior reports and that none of the patients who
received PCI experienced treatment failure in the brain.
PCI has been assessed in several randomized studies,
including 3 studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s
demonstrating that PCI could delay and even prevent the
development of brain metastases from nonsmall cell lung
cancer but did not significantly affect OS.12-14 Preliminary results from a more recent study by the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group assessing the benefit of PCI for
356 patients with stage IIIA or IIIB disease randomized to
PCI versus observation indicated that although PCI did
not affect the 1-year DFS or OS rates, the relapse rate in
the central nervous system was reduced from 18% to
7.7%.15 Thus, based on the lack of a clear survival benefit,
PCI is not recommended routinely for patients with
locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. However, it
has been well established that adenocarcinomas have a
higher propensity to metastasize to the brain than do
squamous cell carcinomas and that superior sulcus tumors
are particularly likely to produce intracranial metastases.16,17 The results of the current study suggest that an
individualized treatment approach to PCI should be used,
with highly selective criteria based on the location and histology of the tumor, patient age, and baseline neurocognitive deficits.18
The current study had several limitations. First, the
number of patients was smaller than that of previous
reports, precluding statistical analyses of predictive factors
such as extent of resection and TNM classification. Second, the potential advantages of postoperative chemoradiation for superior sulcus tumors are accompanied by
some disadvantages, including the possibility of needing a
larger radiation field to cover the entire tumor bed rather

449

Original Article

than a field limited solely by the initial extent of disease. A
second potential disadvantage is an increase in operative
complications because of the lack of tumor downsizing
away from critical structures; however, no such increase in
operative morbidity was found in the current study, and
no mortalities were attributed to treatment. Third, this
study took place over a protracted period of time, from
1994 to 2007. We acknowledge that during this time period, inherent changes in technique and expertise can
occur that can affect tumor control. However, in our
study, we found that the locoregional recurrence rate was
relatively constant over the duration of enrollment, indicating that the treatment year did not influence local recurrence rates.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that the
results of this study, although promising, were undoubtedly dependent on patient selection. Indeed, previous
retrospective studies demonstrating low rates of LRC
with upfront surgery often included substantial percentages of patients for whom gross total resection could
not be achieved. In the current study, all of the patients
initially deemed to have resectable disease ultimately
underwent R0 or R1 resections, highlighting the importance of surgical experience and a referral to a tertiary
medical center when possible. Furthermore, we
acknowledge that prior studies, and particularly the
SWOG study cited above, demonstrated that the longterm survivors were those patients who had R0 resections, which were not achieved in 22% of the patients
in our study. However, the difference in the approaches
is that, whereas in the SWOG study the goal was to
increase resectability rates and thereby reduce the risk of
residual disease postoperatively, in the approach from
our institution, microscopic disease is further addressed
by adjuvant chemoradiation. We do not present these
results as superior to those previously published in prospective trials, but rather present upfront surgery as a
viable method to achieve similar rates of local control
and OS for this disease. Regardless of the timing of surgery, we advocate that this extensive oncologic resection
should be performed by an experienced surgeon with
this technique, if necessary at a tertiary academic center.
In summary, we demonstrated that surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy for
superior sulcus tumors is a reasonable alternative to preoperative chemoradiation, with similar survival outcomes
and treatment toxicity. We further showed that, with
appropriate patient selection and an aggressive chemoradiation regimen, including a radiation fractionation

450

scheme that minimizes late toxicity, 10-year LRC and OS
rates were approximately 75% and 50%, respectively,
with no treatment-related mortality. Finally, our findings
suggest that PCI could be considered for patients with this
subset of nonsmall cell lung cancer, as the rate of intracranial failure for all patients (15%) was substantially lower
than that of previous reports and was 0% among patients
who received PCI. We recognize, however, that the small
number of patients limits the strength of this conclusion.
