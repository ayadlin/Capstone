BACKGROUND: This study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities
(DLT) of the oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, vatalanib, when administered with imatinib and hydroxyurea on a continuous daily schedule among recurrent malignant glioma
patients. METHODS: All patients received 500 mg of hydroxyurea twice daily. Imatinib was dosed at
400 mg per day for patients not taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs; stratum A) and at
500 mg twice-a-day for patients taking EIAEDs (stratum B). Vatalanib was escalated from 500 mg to
1250 mg twice daily in successive cohorts, independently for each stratum. Pharmacokinetics of each drug were
assessed. RESULTS: A total of 37 recurrent patients, 34 (92%) with glioblastoma and 3 (8%) with grade 3
malignant glioma, were enrolled. Nineteen patients (51%) were taking EIAEDs. The MTD of vatalanib for all
patients was 1000 mg twice-a-day. DLTs were hematologic, gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic. No patients
developed intracranial hemorrhage. Concurrent administration of imatinib and hydroxyurea did not affect
vatalanib exposure, but EIAEDs decreased vatalanib and imatinib plasma exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Vatalanib doses up to 1000 mg twice-a-day combined with imatinib and hydroxyurea were well tolerated. Strategies to target tumor blood vessel endothelial cells and pericytes by inhibiting VEGFR and platelet-derived
growth factor, respectively, were safe among recurrent malignant glioma patients and may enhance antianC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Targeting VEGFR/PDGFR in Malignant Glioma/Reardon et al

The current standard of care for patients with newly
diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most
common primary adult central nervous system tumor,
includes radiotherapy plus temozolomide (TMZ), based
on a modest survival benefit compared with radiotherapy
alone. However, recurrence remains universal, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 6.9 months.1
Patients with grade 3 malignant glioma (MG) fare somewhat better, with median survival between 2 and 5 years.2
After recurrence, there is no established, effective treatment.
Therefore, more active therapies to improve survival for
newly diagnosed MG patients and beneficial salvage therapies for patients following progression are critically needed.
Recently, encouraging clinical benefit for patients
with recurrent MG has been reported with antiangiogenic
strategies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) signaling. Agents used in this approach include
cediranib (AZD2171),3 a VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, and bevacizumab (Avastin),
a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, administered with or without irinotecan.4-6
Vatalanib (PTK787) is an orally bioavailable,
amino-phthalazine derivative that potently inhibits
VEGFR1 (Flt-1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (Flt-4)
and can also inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-beta
(PDGFRb) at an IC50 that is approximately twice that of
imatinib.7,8 In preclinical models, vatalanib significantly
diminishes VEGF-mediated glioma growth by inhibiting
neovascularization.9 In phase I studies, daily administration of vatalanib, with or without chemotherapy, were
well tolerated and associated with modest clinical benefit
among patients with recurrent MG.10,11 Subsequent studies have demonstrated that twice-daily dosing of vatalanib
is also well-tolerated and associated with more consistent
drug concentrations compared with once-daily dosing.12
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI-571) has
established activity against hematologic and solid organ
malignancies by means of effective inhibition of selective
receptor tyrosine kinases including Bcr-Abl, c-KIT, c-fms
and PDGF receptor (PDGFR).13 Imatinib has been evaluated in patients with MG based on frequent, increased
expression and activity of PDGF and PDGFR.14-16
Although preclinical studies confirm significant activity,17
clinical benefit with single-agent imatinib in MG is limited.18,19 In contrast, a more substantial clinical benefit has
been described when imatinib is combined with hydroxCancer

yurea, a ribonucleoside reductase inhibitor.20-22 A possible
mechanism underlying this combination includes complementary antiangiogenic activities. Specifically, imatinib
inhibits pericyte stabilization and down-regulates VEGF,23
while protracted, daily hydroxyurea may act as a ‘‘metronomic’’ cytotoxic against tumor endothelial cells.24 Therefore, we postulated that vatalanib may enhance the activity
of imatinib plus hydroxyurea. We escalated the dose of
vatalanib administered twice daily, with daily dosing of
imatinib and hydroxyurea, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
this regimen among recurrent MG patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protocol Objectives
The primary objective of this study was to define the
MTD and DLT of vatalanib when administered twice
daily with imatinib and hydroxyurea to adults with recurrent MG. Secondary objectives included the following: to
define other toxicities associated with the regimen; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib, imatinib, and
hydroxyurea when coadministered to this patient population; and to document antitumor activity.

Patient Eligibility
Patients were required to have a histologically confirmed
diagnosis of grade 3 or 4 MG that was recurrent. Patients
with prior low-grade glioma were eligible if histologic
transformation to MG before enrollment was confirmed.
Patients were also required to be 18 years of age, have a
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 60%, be on a stable corticosteroid dose for 1 week, have satisfactory hematologic (hemoglobin >9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil
count >1000 cells/lL; platelet count >100,000 cells/lL)
and biochemical results (serum creatinine, blood urea
nitrogen [BUN], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and
bilirubin <2.0 times the upper limit of normal), have
recovered from all expected toxicity related to previous
therapy, and provide written informed consent. At least 4
weeks had to have elapsed since prior surgical resection,
radiotherapy, or chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas).
Exclusion criteria were as follows: treatment with
prior PDGFR- or VEGFR-directed agents; >3 episodes

of progressive disease; pregnancy or nursing; intratumoral
hemorrhage (except postoperative grade 1); significant
concurrent medical illness; prior malignancy; concurrent
warfarin use; grade 2 peripheral edema, pulmonary or
pericardial effusion, or ascites; and prior stereotactic
radiosurgery or radioimmunotherapy unless there was
obvious radiographic disease progression or biopsy-proven recurrence.

Treatment Design
Imatinib and vatalanib were provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Florham Park, NJ); hydroxyurea was prescribed. Study medications were taken at the same time
each day and after a light snack, if possible. Vatalanib was
administered alone for the first 7 days of cycle 1 to facilitate pharmacokinetic analyses. Thereafter, all 3 study
medications were administered every day as described
below. Patients and caregivers were carefully taught how
to administer study medications and were asked to complete daily dose administration diaries.
Prior studies confirmed that the metabolism of vatalanib and imatinib are significantly increased by concurrent use of CYP3A enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs
(EIAEDs) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, and primidone.10,11,19,22 Therefore,
patients were accrued independently to 2 strata: stratum A
included patients not taking EIAEDs; stratum B included
patients taking EIAEDs. Imatinib was administered at
400 mg/day to patients on stratum A and at 500 mg
twice-a-day to those on stratum B. Hydroxyurea was
administered at 500 mg twice-a-day to all patients. The
starting dose of vatalanib was 500 mg twice-a-day for stratum A and 750 mg twice-a-day for stratum B. Subsequent
dose levels increased vatalanib by 250 mg twice-a-day
2190

(Table 1). Cohorts of 3-6 patients were treated per dose
level until DLT was observed. Each cycle was 28 days,
except for cycle 1, which was 35 days so that pharmacokinetic studies could be performed.
Dose Escalation and Statistical
Considerations
Vatalanib dose was escalated in successive cohorts of 3
patients as long as DLT did not occur. If 1 instance of
DLT was observed among the initial 3 evaluable patients,
an additional 3 patients were treated at that dose level.
Dose escalation then continued as long as no DLT
occurred in these additional patients. If 2 instances of
DLT were observed at a dose level, the MTD was surpassed, and a total of 6 patients were treated at the previous level to ensure its tolerability. MTD was defined as
the highest dose causing DLT during cycle 1 in no more
than 1 of 6 patients.
Nonhematologic DLT included grade 3 attributable toxicities, except for alopecia, and nausea, vomiting,
or diarrhea that responded to standard medical therapy.
Hematologic DLT included either grade 4 neutropenia or
grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Any toxicity resulting in a
>14-day delay to re-treat was also considered DLT.
Time to progression (TTP) and overall survival
(OS) were measured from treatment initiation and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method including 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Toxicity Evaluation
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Patients
were evaluated by physical examination before each cycle.
In addition, blood pressure was measured weekly for the
Cancer

first cycle and then on Days 1 and 14 of subsequent treatment cycles. A complete blood count with differential was
obtained weekly, and serum electrolytes, BUN/creatinine
and liver function tests were obtained monthly. A urinalysis was performed before the first cycle, as was a b-human
chorionic gonadotropin test in women with reproductive
potential. Patients who experienced DLT or unacceptable
toxicity were followed up weekly until toxicity resolved.
Response Evaluation
Response was evaluated by neurologic examination and
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
before the start of every other treatment cycle and was
graded using modified Macdonald criteria.25 Complete
response (CR) required disappearance of all enhancing tumor on consecutive MRIs at least 6 weeks apart, with corticosteroid discontinuation and neurologic stability or
improvement. Partial response (PR) required 50%
reduction in product of largest perpendicular diameters of
enhancing tumor with stability or improvement of neurologic status and corticosteroid requirement. Progressive
disease (PD) was defined as a 25% increase of enhancing tumor or new lesion. Stable disease (SD) was defined
as any assessment not meeting CR, PR, or PD criteria.
Dose Modification and Retreatment Criteria
Re-treatment required adequate hematologic and biochemical parameters (defined in eligibility criteria) and resolution of any treatment-related grade 3 toxicity to
grade 1. Dose modification was performed for DLTs
during study drug administration. For initial hematologic
DLTs, hydroxyurea was reduced to 500 mg once a day,
whereas subsequent hematologic events required a 25%
imatinib dose reduction. Imatinib was also reduced by
25% for grade 3 rash or edema. Vatalanib was reduced
by 25% for grade 3 nonhematologic events and discontinued for grade 4 hypertension. Study therapy was discontinued for PD, >2 dose reductions due to toxicity,
grade 2 hemorrhage or noncompliance.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Blood samples for vatalanib pharmacokinetics were collected in heparinized tubes on Day 7 (steady state vatalanib
alone) and Day 35 of cycle 1 before treatment; and at 1, 2,

3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the morning dose. Plasma was
prepared by centrifugation and immediately frozen at
20 C. Plasma concentrations of vatalanib were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A 0.25-mL aliquot of plasma, 15 lL of
10 lg/mL internal standard (CGP80805, (4 chloro-phenyl)-[4-2, 6-dimethyl-pyridylmethyl phthalazin-1-yl])
amine, molecular weight, 374.87), 500 lL of 0.1 N
NaOH, and 5.5 mL of t-butylmethyl-ether were pipetted
into a 10-mL conical glass tube. The tube was shaken in an
overhead shaker for 10 minutes. After 5 minutes of centrifugation at 4000 rpm, the organic layer was transferred into
another tube and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen
stream at 40 C. The residue was redissolved in 100 lL of
mobile phase, and 75 lL were injected into the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The isocratic mobile phase, consisting of 5 g of ammonium acetate
dissolved in 1250 mL of distilled water, and 600 mL of acetonitrile, brought to pH 6.5 with phosphoric acid, was
pumped at 0.4 mL/min. Chromatographic separation was
achieved with an Inertsil column (5 lm, 125  2 mm
inside diameter; Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif). The lower
limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/mL, with a concentration range of 2.5 to 10,000 ng/mL. At concentrations of
20, 800, and 8000 ng/mL, the intraday variability (percent
coefficient of variation [CV percent]) was 0.7, 1.4, and 1.3,
respectively. At concentrations of 20, 800, and 8000 ng/
mL, the interday variability (CV percent) was 1.3, 2.0, and
1.6, respectively. The CV percent for the assay sensitivity at
2.5 ng/mL was 4.0.
Blood samples for imatinib and hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics were collected in heparinized tubes on Days
8 and 35 of cycle 1 before treatment; and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the morning dose. Plasma was
prepared by centrifugation and immediately frozen at
20 C. Plasma concentrations of imatinib and its active
metabolite CGP74588 were determined with a validated
liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy assay.26 Plasma
concentrations of hydroxyurea were determined with a
validated HPLC assay.22
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of vatalanib
were extracted from the data using standard noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin Professional 4.1, Pharsight,
Mountain View, Calif), whereas the parameters for imatinib, CGP74588, and hydroxyurea were estimated noncompartmentally using the LaGrange function27 as

implemented by the LAGRAN computer program.28 The
maximum concentration normalized for dose (Cmax/D)
and time to reach the maximum concentration (tmax) were
determined by visual inspection of the plasma concentration versus time curves. Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) was calculated with extrapolation to
infinity for the first dose, or extrapolation until the next
dosing time (either 12 hours or 24 hours) for doses at
steady-state. The AUC was used to calculate clearance
(CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).
Statistical analyses for pharmacokinetics were performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). Per analyte, only the data from patients with
full pharmacokinetic profiles on both days of pharmacokinetic sampling were used in the subsequent statistical
analyses. The pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of
vatalanib determined in the absence (Day 7) and presence
(Day 35) of imatinib and hydroxyurea were compared (after logarithmic transformation) with a 2-tailed, t test for
paired data, for which a P < .05 was considered significant. The difference between Day 7 and Day 35 vatalanib
tmax was analyzed (untransformed) by the 2-tailed exact
Wilcoxon signed rank test. The pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of vatalanib in patients taking EIAEDs and
patients not taking EIAEDs were compared (after logarithmic transformation) with a 2-tailed, t test, for which a
P < .05 was considered significant. The untransformed
values for vatalanib tmax were analyzed by the exact 2tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of imatinib, CGP74588, and hydroxyurea
on Day 8 and Day 35 were compared with the same statistical tests described for comparison of Day 7 and Day 35
vatalanib pharmacokinetic parameters.

courses of imatinib, hydroxyurea, and vatalanib were
administered, including 80 to patients on stratum A and
68 to patients on stratum B.
Overall, up to 1000 mg twice-a-day of vatalanib was
well tolerated when combined with imatinib plus hydroxyurea. Grade 3 hematologic toxicities were uncommon
and resolved promptly with study drug interruption. Only
2 episodes of grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred, whereas
grades 3 or 4 neutropenia complicated 3% of administered
courses, respectively. The most frequent nonhematologic
toxicities included hypertension (9% of courses) and fatigue (8% of courses). A total of 11 patients (30%) experienced grade 2 hypertension, and 2 patients (5%)
developed grade 3 hypertension. All episodes of hypertension responded to appropriate medical therapy. Grade 3
fatigue, which persisted throughout the course of therapy,
was experienced by 2 patients, and grade 4 fatigue was not
observed. Approximately 5% of courses were complicated
by grade 2 nausea/emesis or mucositis that responded to
appropriate medical therapy, whereas reversible grade 3
transaminase elevation occurred after 3% of courses. Diarrhea, infection, and rash, all limited to grade 2, also complicated 3% of administered courses, and responded to
appropriate medical therapy. Of note, no patients developed central nervous system hemorrhage.
There were 3 patients not eligible for DLT assessment; 2 patients took an incorrect dose of vatalanib during cycle 1, and 1 patient voluntarily withdrew after the

first 11 days of cycle 1. Only 1 DLT occurred among stratum A patients and included reversible, grade 3 thrombocytopenia at dose level 3. In contrast, 3 patients in stratum
B experienced 4 DLTs. One patient at dose level 2 developed reversible grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 transaminase elevation. Two patients treated at dose level 3
experienced DLT consisting of reversible grade 3 fatigue
and rash, respectively. These results confirmed the MTD
of vatalanib to be 1000 mg twice a day when administered
with imatinib and hydroxyurea for patients on stratum B.
Dose escalation for patients on stratum A beyond the
MTD established for stratum B patients was not performed for safety concerns. Specifically, vatalanib exposures and potential associated toxicity were predicted to
be higher for patients not taking EIAEDs compared with
those taking EIAEDs.10,11 Therefore, vatalanib dose escalation for stratum A above the MTD for stratum B was
not performed, and the recommended vatalanib dose for
all patients, irrespective of whether or not they are taking
EIAEDs, was defined as 1000 mg twice-a-day when
administered with imatinib and hydroxyurea.
Outcome
The median follow-up for all patients was 108 weeks
(95% CI, 99-134 weeks). The median OS, median PFS,
and 6-month PFS rate for all GBM patients were 48
weeks (range, 35-68 weeks), 12 weeks (range, 9-22
weeks), and 25% (range, 12% to 40%), respectively, and

9 patients (24%) achieved a radiographic PR (Fig. 1), and
18 (49%) patients achieved SD. Progressive disease was

Pharmacokinetics
The number of patients with full plasma pharmacokinetic
profiles on both the first and second days of pharmacokinetic sampling as well as overall pharmacokinetic results for
vatalanib, imatinib, CGP74588, and hydroxyurea are summarized in Table 4. The smaller percentage of patients taking EIAEDs who had full pharmacokinetic data on both
days of sampling primarily reflected the failure to obtain

pharmacokinetic samples in most of those patients and
incomplete pharmacokinetic sampling in others.
There was no significant effect of vatalanib dose on
vatalanib pharmacokinetic parameters. The use of
EIAEDs had a significant effect on vatalanib Day 7 pharmacokinetics, decreasing Cmax/D and increasing CL/F
approximately 3-fold, and, surprisingly, increasingly V/F
more than 3-fold, while not significantly affecting the
plasma t1 of 2. Similar effects were seen on Day 35,
although the differences did not reach statistical significance because of higher interpatient variability. There was
no difference in either stratum between vatalanib pharmacokinetics on Day 7 when vatalanib was administered
alone, or on Day 35 when vatalanib was coadministered
with imatinib and hydroxyurea.

Cmax/D indicates maximum concentration normalized for dose; tmax, time to reach the maximum concentration; t1/2, time to reach the half concentration; AUC,
area under the concentration versus time curve; CL/F, calculate clearance.

The use of EIAEDs decreased imatinib Cmax/D and
increased CL/F, but not V/F, as previously reported.22
Although imatinib and hydroxyurea were coadministered
on both Days 8 and 35, the effect of hydroxyurea on imatinib pharmacokinetics became fully apparent at Day 35
and was characterized by an increase in Cmax/D and
decreases in CL/F and V/F as previously described.22
These effects were more pronounced in the patients taking
EIAEDs, in whom hydroxyurea almost neutralized the
effect of EIAEDs on imatinib pharmacokinetics. The
effects of EIAEDs and hydroxyurea on CGP74588 pharmacokinetics were similar to those on imatinib, but are
harder to interpret, as both formation and elimination of
CGP74588 are mediated by metabolism. There was no

DISCUSSION
Recent studies suggest that targeting angiogenesis represents an important advance in the treatment of MG
patients. Vredenburgh demonstrated that the humanized
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab in combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan was
associated with radiographic response rates of 67% and
61% among patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma and
GBM, respectively. Furthermore, 6-month PFS rates
were 56% and 30% for patients with recurrent grade 3
2195

Original Article

and grade 4 MG, respectively. The median OS was 40
weeks for recurrent GBM patients.4,5 These results compare favorably with those achieved using TMZ in patients
with first recurrence of anaplastic glioma and GBM,
respectively.29,30 Smaller series of recurrent MG patients
treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan demonstrate
comparable rates of radiographic response and outcome
benefit.31,32 In addition, preliminary results of a randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing bevacizumab to
bevacizumab plus irinotecan among recurrent GBM
patients, demonstrate prolonged survival relative to previously reported salvage therapy approaches.6
In addition, Batchelor et al recently demonstrated
that single-agent cediranib, a pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, achieved a radiographic response rate of 50%
and a median PFS of 16 weeks among recurrent GBM
patients.3 Furthermore, using a constellation of sophisticated imaging modalities, the authors demonstrated
that patients treated with cediranib exhibited radiographic findings consistent with the hypothesis that antiangiogenic agents can transiently normalize tumor
vasculature.33
Preclinical studies suggest that targeting PDGFR
signaling, an important mediator of pericyte stabilization
of tumor blood vessels,34,35 may complement the antitumor activity of VEGF inhibitor therapy.23,36-38 Clinical
studies evaluating agents with dual inhibitory effects on
VEGFR and PDGFR also show encouraging activity in
select cancers.3,39,40 We conducted the current study to
evaluate the safety and toxicity of the VEGFR inhibitor
vatalanib in combination with standard doses of imatinib,
a potential PDGFR inhibitor, in recurrent MG patients.
Hydroxyurea was included in the current regimen because
prior studies suggest it may enhance the antitumor activity
of imatinib in recurrent MG patients.20-22 In the current
study, vatalanib was well tolerated up to the MTD of
1000 mg twice-a-day when administered on a continuous
dosing schedule. Although the spectrum of toxicities
appeared similar between both strata, toxicity frequency
appeared increased for patients on EIAEDs. The explanation for this observation may involve the higher percentage of patients treated at second or third recurrence for
stratum B rather than pharmacokinetic factors. In fact,
although stratum B patients received higher doses of vatalanib and imatinib, clearance was increased and overall
exposures were decreased relative to patients not on
2196

EIAEDs. Of note, intratumoral hemorrhage was not
observed among patients treated with this regimen.
Day 7 vatalanib plasma pharmacokinetic data in
patients not taking EIAEDs agreed with previous reports
of single-agent vatalanib.12,41,42 The effects of EIAEDs on
vatalanib AUC, Cmax, and CL/F agree with earlier reports
of the effects of EIAEDs on imatinib pharmacokinetics.19,22 This finding was not unexpected as both vatalanib and imatinib are cleared by CYP metabolism. Day
35 vatalanib plasma pharmacokinetic data did not differ
substantially from that obtained on Day 7, suggesting that
concurrent imatinib and hydroxyurea administration did
not affect vatalanib metabolism. Chronic dosing of
hydroxyurea affected the pharmacokinetics of imatinib, as
previously reported.22 The hypothesized mechanism of
this alteration was inhibition of CYP enzymes. It is, therefore, surprising that the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib,
also cleared primarily by CYP3A metabolism,42 were not
affected by hydroxyurea therapy. The basis for this lack of
effect on vatalanib is unclear, but might reflect compensatory routes of elimination for vatalanib, as opposed to
imatinib.
Although the radiographic response rate, median
PFS, and 6-month PFS are encouraging, particularly
because all patients in this study had failed prior TMZ
therapy, efficacy conclusions are clearly limited by
small sample size and dose escalation design. Furthermore, potent VEGFR inhibitors such as vatalanib can
rapidly diminish permeability and subsequent contrast
enhancement, making evaluation of radiographic
response difficult.12,43 In the present study, we defined
the MTD of vatalanib when administered with imatinib and hydroxyurea. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that combining potential inhibitors of VEGFR
and PDGFR, 2 key regulators of tumor vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, can be achieved safely in
patients with recurrent MG. Further clinical evaluation
of this strategy may improve the antitumor benefit
associated with antiangiogenic regimens solely targeting
VEGFR.
