ABSTRACT
Identification of novel anti-cancer compounds with high efficacy and low toxicity is
critical in drug development. High-throughput screening and other such strategies are
generally resource-intensive. Therefore, in silico computer-aided drug design has gained
rapid acceptance and popularity. We employed our proprietary computational platform
(CHEMSAS®), which uses a unique combination of traditional and modern pharmacology
principles, statistical modeling, medicinal chemistry, and machine-learning technologies
to discover and optimize novel compounds that could target various cancers. COTI-2
is a small molecule candidate anti-cancer drug identified using CHEMSAS. This study
describes the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of COTI-2. Our data demonstrate that COTI-2
is effective against a diverse group of human cancer cell lines regardless of their tissue
of origin or genetic makeup. Most treated cancer cell lines were sensitive to COTI-2 at
nanomolar concentrations. When compared to traditional chemotherapy or targetedtherapy agents, COTI-2 showed superior activity against tumor cells, in vitro and in
vivo. Despite its potent anti-tumor efficacy, COTI-2 was safe and well-tolerated in vivo.
Although the mechanism of action of COTI-2 is still under investigation, preliminary
results indicate that it is not a traditional kinase or an Hsp90 inhibitor.

techniques, or hypothesis-driven research (in the case of
molecules targetable by rational design of therapeutic agents),
is often challenging and can take years [3]. In silico drug
design that simulates HTS in combination with elements
of rational design has played a more prominent role in the
identification of therapeutically-important small molecules in
the past three decades [4]. The advantage of computer-aided
drug design over HTS is that, unlike unbiased methods, it
is capable of ranking candidate therapeutic compounds
to allow selection of a manageably small number for
screening in the laboratory [5]. In addition, the inclusion
of rational elements in the ranking process (for example,
selection of the most effective and least toxic structures
from existing therapeutic compounds) reduces both time
and cost required for preclinical development [6]. However,

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in high-throughput cancer genome
sequencing such as whole genome sequencing and functional
screening using RNA interference have revealed exploitable
characteristics of cancer cells that could be targeted in cancer
treatment [1]. Therefore, novel small molecules are designed
or screened to target genetic addictions, susceptibilities,
and dependencies of cancer cells resulting in the transition
from cytotoxic chemotherapy to the targeted-therapy era.
However, discovering a novel and effective drug can be
extremely challenging since not all discovered biological
targets are druggable [2]. Moreover, developing a drug
candidate either through relatively unbiased high-throughput
screening (HTS) processes that automate laboratory

despite the inefficiency and the high cost associated with
virtually all HTS strategies, they remain common in the drug
development process. Therefore, computational technologies
that can precisely identify and predict structures with desired
inhibitory effects and low toxicity are of utmost value to the
modern process of drug development [4].
We applied a novel and proprietary computational
platform called CHEMSAS® that uses a unique
combination of traditional and modern pharmacology
principles, statistical modeling, medicinal chemistry,
and machine-learning technologies to discover, profile,
and optimize novel compounds that could target various
human malignancies. At the centre of the CHEMSAS
platform is a hybrid machine-learning technology that can
find, profile, and optimize novel targeted lead compounds.
It can also find novel uses for known compounds and
solve problems with existing or potential drugs stored in
its database. The CHEMSAS platform is supported by
“Chembase”, which is a proprietary powerful database
comprised of over a million known compounds with
associated laboratory data covering a wide variety of
biological and pharmacokinetic targets.
Using the CHEMSAS platform, we developed 244
molecular descriptors for each candidate therapeutic
compound. For example, we assessed molecular
properties relating to a candidate compound’s therapeutic
efficacy, expected human toxicity, oral absorption,
cumulative cellular resistance, and its kinetics. In
some instances, comparative properties relating to
commercially relevant benchmark compounds were
also assessed. Potential lead compounds were then
selected from the candidate library using a proprietary
decision-making tool designed to identify candidates
with the optimal physical chemical properties, efficacy,
and ADMET properties (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) according to a predetermined set of design criteria.
COTI-2, the lead compound selected from the
candidate library of up to 10 novel compounds on
multiple scaffolds optimized for the treatment of various
cancers, was synthesized for further development. The
preclinical development of COTI-2 included the in vitro
and in vivo evaluation of the compound against a variety
of cancer cell lines. This testing acts as further validation
of our proprietary platform. In this study, we investigated
the anti-cancer effects and conducted a preliminary
exploration of the mechanism of action of COTI-2.
Our results show that COTI-2 is highly efficacious
against multiple cancer cell lines from a broad range of
human cancers both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
it demonstrated a low toxicity profile in mice and better
efficacy when compared to standard chemotherapeutic and
targeted-therapeutic agents. Early mechanism of action
studies demonstrate that COTI-2 is not a traditional kinase
inhibitor nor is it an Hsp90 protein inhibitor and that it
causes cancer cell death via apoptosis.

COTI-2 inhibits the growth of various cancer
cell lines in vitro
CHEMSAS is a novel in silico machine learning
process that predicts target biological activities from
molecular structure. We used CHEMSAS to design COTI2, a third-generation thiosemicarbazone engineered for high
efficacy and low toxicity (Figure 1A). We tested the efficacy
of COTI-2 against a diverse group of human cancer cell
lines with different genetic mutation backgrounds. COTI-2
efficiently inhibited the proliferation rate of all the tested
cell lines following 72 h of treatment (Figure 1B). Most cell
lines showed nanomolar sensitivity to COTI-2 treatment,
regardless of the tissue of origin or genetic makeup.

COTI-2 is more effective at inhibiting tumor cell
proliferation than cetuximab and erlotinib
Targeted-therapy drugs are often designed to have
lower toxicity towards normal cells [7]. Agents such as
cetuximab and erlotinib are used to treat various types
of cancers including colorectal cancer, head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), and pancreatic cancer [8–11]. These drugs are
designed to specifically inhibit epidermal growth factor
receptors that are often over-expressed and/or mutated in
the aforementioned cancers [8, 12]. COTI-2 showed potent
anti-proliferative activity against a broad collection of
human cancer cell lines including some malignancies for
which cetuximab and/or erlotinib are approved treatments.
We therefore compared the anti-proliferative capacity
of COTI-2 against both cetuximab and erlotinib in three
human colorectal cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 2,
COTI-2 was significantly more effective at inhibiting tumor
cell proliferation than either cetuximab or erlotinib in all three
cell lines (COLO-205, HCT-15, and SW620). Notably, all
three lines were insensitive to growth inhibition (cytostasis,
cytotoxicity, or a combination of the two) to any degree in
response to low concentrations of cetuximab and erlotinib,
but highly sensitive to even low doses of COTI-2. Similar
results were observed in the H292 and H1975 human NSCLC
cell lines that suggest these cell lines are more sensitive to
COTI-2 than erlotinib (Supplementary Table S1).

Human glioblastoma cells are more sensitive
to COTI-2 than to cisplatin or BCNU
Adjuvant chemotherapy agents are among the most
common regimens for the treatment of glioblastoma
[13]. However, their effectiveness is limited and often
accompanied by high toxicity [14]. Cisplatin and BCNU
(carmustine) are often used against glioblastoma but patient
response is limited [14]. We tested COTI-2 against multiple
human glioblastoma tumors in vitro. As shown in Figure

3A, relatively low concentrations of COTI-2 were active
against all human glioblastoma cell lines tested (U87-MG,
SNB-19, SF-268, and SF-295). Two of the aforementioned
cell lines, (U87-MG and SNB-19) were used to compare
the efficacy of COTI-2, cisplatin, and BCNU. As shown in
Figure 3B, COTI-2 showed superior activity and low IC50
when compared to cisplatin and BCNU in the treatment of
human glioblastoma cell lines. These data collectively show
that COTI-2 is more effective than some chemotherapy
agents approved for treatment of glioblastoma.

in multiple human tumor cell lines. SHP-77 small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) cells were exposed to various
concentrations of COTI-2 for 48 h then stained with
Annexin V and 7AAD to measure early and late apoptotic
events [15]. COTI-2 treatment of SHP-77 cells with
approximate IC50 concentrations resulted in the induction
of early apoptosis among 40 to 47% of total cells (Figure
4A). COTI-2 treatment of SHP-77 cells with the IC90
concentration induced early and late apoptosis/necrosis
in most cells. These data indicate that COTI-2 has
cytotoxic effects against cancer cells even in nanomolar
concentrations, primarily through induction of apoptosis.
To further elucidate the effect of COTI-2 on cancer
cells, including induction of apoptosis, we treated three
human SCLC cell lines (SHP-77, DMS-114, and DMS-153)
with IC50 concentrations of COTI-2 following incubation
with or without the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK.

COTI-2 treatment induces apoptosis in cancer cells
COTI-2 is effective against a wide variety of human
tumor cells (Figure 1B). In an effort to understand the
mechanism by which COTI-2 inhibited cell proliferation,
we examined the capacity of COTI-2 to induce apoptosis

cell lines in vitro (Figure 1B). We therefore examined
the ability of COTI-2 to reduce U87-MG xenograft
growth in vivo when administered IP. U87-MG is a
particularly aggressive glioblastoma model that is hard
to control with chemotherapy [14]. Similar to the effect
on HT-29 tumors, COTI-2 treatment both reduced U87MG tumor volumes at specific times post-treatment and
lengthened the time required for U87-MG xenografts to
grow in nude mice (Figure 6). Control tumors in mice
treated with vehicle alone took only 5 days to reach an
average volume of 828 mm3 while tumors in animals
treated with COTI-2 took double that time (10 days)
to reach a similar mean volume (857 mm3). We further
examined the capacity of COTI-2 to delay tumor growth
in an aggressive breast cancer model (MDA-MB-231)
when administered orally or per os (PO) in animals. PO
treatment with COTI-2 delayed tumor xenograft growth
(Supplementary Figure S2).

This cell-permeable inhibitor prevents apoptosis induction
in target cells by irreversibly binding to the catalytic site of
caspase proteases [16]. Z-VAD-FMK-mediated inhibition
of caspase cascades in all three SCLC cell lines to almost
completely abrogate apoptosis, confirming the role of
COTI-2 in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells via activation
of the caspase cascade (Figure 4B).
Previous gene expression analysis studies suggested
involvement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the
mechanism of action of COTI-2 (our unpublished data).
Activated AKT that is phosphorylated at Ser473 and
Thr308 amino acid residues is thought to be responsible for
the inactivation of caspase-9 [17, 18]. Unphosphorylated
caspase-9 undergoes cleavage to active caspase-9 by an
auto-proteolytic mechanism [18]. Phosphorylation of
caspase-9 by phospho-Akt (p-AKT) impedes this process
and thereby prevents downstream activation of caspase-3
[19]. We therefore examined the effect of COTI-2 on
p-AKT and phosphorylated caspase-9 (p-caspase-9) in
SHP-77 cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1,
COTI-2 treatment reduced p-AKT and p-caspase-9 levels
in SHP-77 cells, further establishing its role in inducing
apoptosis via caspase pathways in cancer cells.

COTI-2 treatment effectively inhibits OVCAR-3
xenograft growth
COTI-2 was effective in inhibiting the proliferation
of multiple ovarian tumor cell lines in the nanomolar range
(Figure 1). We therefore examined the capacity of COTI2 to inhibit OVCAR-3 tumor xenografts when treated
intravenously (IV) or PO. As shown in Figure 7, COTI2 treatment effectively inhibited OVCAR-3 xenograft
growth regardless of the route of administration. In fact,
significant inhibition was noted as early as the first week
of treatment.

COTI-2 effectively inhibits the growth of HT-29
and SHP-77 xenografts
We assessed the effectiveness of COTI-2 in
inhibiting the growth of HT-29 and SHP-77 xenografts
in immunocompromised mice when administered
intraperitoneally (IP). COTI-2 significantly inhibited
tumor growth in the HT-29 human colorectal tumor
xenografts at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Figure 5A). In addition
to reducing tumor volumes at specific times posttreatment, COTI-2 also delayed the time required for
tumors to reach specified volumes. For example, control
tumors in mice treated with vehicle alone took only 32
days to reach a mean volume of 618 mm3, while tumors
in mice treated with COTI-2 took 50% longer (48 days)
to reach a similar mean volume (626 mm3)(Figure 5A).
COTI-2 also significantly inhibited tumor growth in
the SHP-77 SCLC xenograft model at a dose as low as
3 mg/kg. Calculation of COTI-2-induced delay in time
to reach similar volume was not possible in the case
of SHP-77 xenografts, as those tumors never reached
average volumes similar to controls. In fact, COTI-2 was
significantly more effective than cisplatin and paclitaxel at
inhibiting SHP-77 xenograft growth (Figure 5B).

COTI-2 treatment demonstrates a safe toxicity
profile in vivo
Drug-induced toxicity is a major limiting factor in
the success of all forms of cancer therapies, including
cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted-therapy, and most
recently immunotherapy [20, 21]. Our CHEMSAS
platform has the capacity to design molecules that
have limited toxicity towards healthy cells and COTI2 was designed for low toxicity against normal cells.
We therefore examined the potential toxicity of COTI2 in non-tumor-bearing mice over a 28-day chronic
treatment study. As shown in Figure 8A, increasing
doses of COTI-2 did not cause weight loss or any overt
signs of morbidity in immunocompetent animals.
Similar results were observed in the COTI-2 treatment
of tumor-bearing mice (OVCAR-3 xenografts) where
the mice tolerated the drug without displaying any
signs of morbidity or weight loss (Figure 8B–8C).
This suggests that COTI-2 selectively targets a wide
variety of human cancer cell lines, as demonstrated by
the in vitro data, while having little deleterious effects
on normal cells.

DISCUSSION

common human malignancies, allowing assessment of
effectiveness of COTI-2 in cell lines with various mutations
including; TP53 (HT-29, HCT-15, OVCAR-3, K562, SF268, SNB-19, T47D, MDA-MB-231), KRAS (MDAMB-231, SW620), PIK3CA (MCF7, HT-29, T47D), APC
(COLO-205, HCT-15), and PTEN (SF-295, SNB-19)
[25]. COTI-2 appears to be a cytotoxic agent [26] since
it inhibited cellular proliferation by inducing apoptosis in
cancer cells (Figure 4). COTI-2-mediated cellular death was
prevented when cancer cells were pre-treated with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, confirming the activation of
caspase cascades upon treatment with COTI-2 (Figure 4B).
Since COTI-2 was highly effective against a broad
range of cancer types, our initial mechanistic studies
involved the evaluation of COTI-2 as a kinase and
Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor. To reduce the probability of
false positives/negatives, COTI-2 was evaluated using
two distinct kinase assays: an ATP-competitive binding
assay and a radiometric functional assay. COTI-2 did
not significantly inhibit over 200 kinases from major

High-throughput screening (HTS) is widely used to
identify new drug candidates. However, due to the intense
resource consumption, low hit rates and unacceptably high
failure rates in clinical trials, in silico drug design has
gained popularity as a rational approach to predict clinical
activity [22]. We have developed a proprietary, computerbased drug discovery technology (CHEMSAS) to identify
a novel, small molecule, antineoplastic drug candidate
called COTI-2. In the current study, we evaluated the in
vitro and in vivo efficacy of COTI-2 in a variety of human
cancers.
COTI-2 demonstrated effective anti-proliferative
activity against solid epithelial cancer and leukemia cell
lines (Figure 1B). Despite sharing common mutations,
human cancers are strikingly heterogeneous, even among
similar types of cancers, thus making them difficult to
treat [23, 24]. We therefore assessed the efficacy of COTI2 against multiple human cancer cell lines representing

kinase pathways involved in cancer that were evaluated
in both kinase assays (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Furthermore, COTI-2 did not inhibit the ATPase activity
of Hsp90, a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that plays
an essential role in cell survival and cell cycle control
[27] (Supplementary Table S4). Ongoing studies suggest
that COTI-2 may act primarily on mutated p53 and the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (our unpublished data).

Interestingly, most tested cell lines with mutant P53
were highly sensitive to COTI-2. However, there were
other cell lines such as HCT-115, H292, and H460 with
wild type P53 that were also highly sensitive to COTI-2
treatment. This suggests that COTI-2 may affect mutant
P53 in human tumors, but likely has additional effects on
other targets in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. COTI-2
also appears to negatively modulate the phosphorylation

days before all the animals were sacrificed. COTI-2 treatment did not result in mice losing weight or showing any sign of morbidity.

2 in reducing proliferation of U87-MG and SNB-19
glioblastoma cells in vitro (Figure 3). In fact, COTI-2
was 10 to 500 times more effective than these agents,
suggesting that COTI-2 is more efficacious than standard
chemotherapeutic agents when tested against human
glioblastoma cell lines.
We investigated the in vivo efficacy of COTI-2
in 5 tumor xenograft models in mice (HT-29 colorectal
cancer, SHP-77 SCLC, U87-MG glioblastoma, MDAMB-231 breast cancer, and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer).
The xenograft tumors were established by subcutaneous
inoculation of tumor cells into nude mice and COTI-2
was administered either IP, PO, or IV. COTI-2 induced
significant tumor growth delay in both the particularly
aggressive [37, 38] HT-29 (Figure 5A) and U87-MG
(Figure 6A) xenograft models when administered IP. When
compared to the standard chemotherapeutics cisplatin and
paclitaxel [39], COTI-2 significantly delayed the growth
of SHP-77 xenografts in immunocompromised mice when
administered IP (Figure 5B). Depending on the xenograft
model, tumor volumes after treatment with COTI-2 were
as low as 5% of the volumes of control tumors in mice
treated with vehicle alone.
COTI-2 was also equally effective when the route
of administration was changed from IP to PO in both
the MDA-MB-231 and OVCAR-3 tumor xenografts.
Following PO treatment, COTI-2 significantly reduced
tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
xenografts (Supplementary Figure S2). COTI-2 was most
effective against human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3
xenografts whether administered IV or PO (Figure 7).
In fact, tumor regression was observed following IV
administration of COTI-2 in this model (Figure 7A)
while tumor volumes remained relatively low and stable
over the 60 days of PO treatment (Figure 7B). COTI-2
administered repeatedly for 28 days (monitored for up to
60 days) did not induce overt signs of toxicity or weight
loss, whether administered IV, PO, or IP, or to tumorbearing immunocompromised mice or immune-competent
mice (Figure 8).
Overall, our data shows that COTI-2 is a novel small
molecule active against a wide variety of human tumor
cell lines and xenografts that are traditionally difficult to
treat. It activates the caspase signaling cascade, thereby
apoptosis in tumor cells. COTI-2 also shows enhanced
activity compared to some first-line chemotherapy drugs
and targeted-therapy agents. It is active regardless of the
route of administration. Most importantly, COTI-2 is welltolerated in vivo and shows a favorable safety profile in
mice with different genetic backgrounds. Although the
precise mechanism of action of COTI-2 is still under
investigation, the data indicates that it is not a traditional
kinase or Hsp90 inhibitor. Additional studies to further
elucidate the mechanism of action of COTI-2 are currently
underway.

of AKT either directly or indirectly (our unpublished
data). We confirmed that COTI-2 treatment reduced
phosphorylated-AKT and -caspase-9 in SHP-77 cells
suggesting a role for it negatively modulating the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway in cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure S1). Further studies on the mechanism of action of
COTI-2 are ongoing.
Despite important advances, many current
chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapeutic
drugs demonstrate poor efficacy [28, 29]. We decided to
compare the efficacy of COTI-2 in vitro against standard
chemotherapeutics and approved targeted-therapy agents
such as cisplatin, BCNU, cetuximab, and erlotinib.
Cetuximab and erlotinib are targeted therapies
against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
a protein kinase with a crucial role in cell death and
survival [30]. Erlotinib inhibits ATP-binding of the
EGFR tyrosine kinase and is approved for treatment of
metastatic NSCLC and advanced pancreatic cancer [11].
Additional indications, such as recurrent or metastatic
colorectal cancer, are being explored in clinical trials
(NCT00032110). We compared the efficacy of erlotinib
to COTI-2 in NSCLC and colorectal cancer cell lines
since erlotinib has been approved or is being investigated
for the treatment of these indications (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Table S1). COTI-2 was more effective
at inhibiting the proliferation of both H292 and H1975
NSCLC cells when compared to erlotinib in vitro. As
expected, erlotinib was more potent in the H292 than
H1975 cells since the latter cell line carries a T790M
EGFR mutation that confers resistance to erlotinib [31].
COTI-2, on the other hand, was equally effective in these
cell lines regardless of the EGFR mutation. All the tested
colorectal cancer cells line (SW620, COLO-205, and
HCT-15) showed resistance to the tested doses of erlotinib
but were sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of COTI-2
(Figure 2).
Cetuximab is approved for treatment of colorectal
and metastatic head and neck cancer [8], and is currently
being investigated as therapy for NSCLC (NCT00492206)
and pancreatic cancer (NCT00305760) [32]. We compared
its efficacy to COTI-2 in SW620, COLO-205, and HCT15 colorectal cancer cell lines. All three were relatively
resistant to cetuximab but sensitive to COTI-2 (Figure
2). This is significant because KRAS mutations mediate
resistance to cetuximab and approximately 50% of
colorectal cancer patients display this mutation [33]. Our
data suggests that COTI-2 is effective against colorectal
cancer cell lines regardless of their KRAS mutation status.
Current treatment strategy for malignant
glioblastoma multiforme [34], an aggressive adult and
pediatric brain cancer, includes agents with limited
activity such as temozolomide, cisplatin, and BCNU
[14]. The DNA damage-inducing agents cisplatin
and BCNU [35, 36] were not as effective as COTI-

lung cancer (NSCLC) (A549, H226, H292, H1975, and
NCI-H460), human colorectal cancer (SW620, COLO205, HCT-15, HCT-116, and HT-29), human glioma/
astrocytoma (SF-268, SF-295, SNB-19, and U87-MG),
human ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5,
OVCAR-8 and CaOv-3), human breast cancer (MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231), human leukemia (HL60
and K562), human endometrial cancer (Ishikawa, Hec1A, KLE, and RL-95-2), and human pancreatic cancer
cell lines (PANC-1, Panc 02.03, Panc 03.27, Panc 10.05,
Capan-2, BxPC-3, and AsPC-1) were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), National
Institute of Health (NCI) repository, or Charles River
Laboratories amplified and frozen at -80°C and never
passaged (upon thawing) for more than one month before
use in an experiment. Cell lines were maintained under
standard condition in 37°C in 5% CO2. All cell lines
were tested to ensure viability and lack of contaminating
mycoplasma and common viruses (Idexx Bioresearch
IMPACT II RADIL testing), and their identity verified
using the GenePrint® 10 System (10 markers) at The
Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick
Children, Toronto, Canada. All human tumor cell lines
were seeded in tissue culture medium plus 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a cell
density that allowed for growth to no more than 75-80%
confluence by 3 or 4 days after seeding, depending on the
experiment. OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-8, AsPC-1,
and BxPC-3 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Capan-2
and Hec1A were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium. KLE
cells were grown in DMEM-F12 medium. RL-95-2 cells
were grown in DMEM-F12 + insulin (5 μg/ml). CaOV-3
and PANC-1 cells were grown in DMEM, and Ishikawa
cells were grown in MEMα + NEAA (non-essential amino
acids). All were supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator without antibiotics.
All other cell lines were cultured in MEMα + 10% FBS
without antibiotics.

Proliferation assay (cell counting)
Tumor cell proliferation after drug treatment was
described previously [40]. Briefly, tumor cells were washed
with 1X PBS, trypsinized, and counted using a Beckman
Coulter Z1 Particle Counter (Beckman, Mississauga,
Ontario) three days after treatment at a cell density of no
more than 80%. The fold-change in cell number after 72 h
of growth (relative to the starting number of seeded cells)
was calculated according to the following formula:
Fold Change =

(N um berofCells,D ay0)

The drug effects on proliferation were expressed as
“Proliferation (% control)” and were calculated as follows:
Proliferation(% Control)=

Treatm entFold Change
ControlFold Change

× 100

The control cultures were treated with vehicle
minus the drug. For all IC50 determinations, preliminary
experiments were performed to determine the range of
appropriate concentrations. A second and final series
of experiments were then performed (4 independent
experiments, n=3 replicate measures for each
experiment) using COTI-2 or other drug concentrations
higher and lower than the estimated IC50, and
including concentrations that reduced proliferation by
approximately 40% and 60%. The IC50 for each of the
4 experiments was determined by interpolation between
these values, and error estimates (SEM) for the final IC50
calculated using the 4 values.
Proliferation assay (by alamarBlue® measurement of
metabolic activity)
Tumor cell proliferation was also measured by
alamarBlue® assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Viable
tumor cells were plated in 96-well culture plates and
allowed to adhere for 16 h, followed by addition of COTI2 (in medium plus 10% FBS) at multiple concentrations
ranging from those that had no effect on proliferation
to those that inhibited proliferation by 90% or more.
AlamarBlue was then added to the cells after 4-7 days of
drug exposure (approximately 4 doublings of the control
cells), and assayed for total cellular metabolic activity (a
function of population density of live cells) by absorbance
using a Wallac Victor2 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer
Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Concentrations of the agent
required to inhibit proliferation by 50% (IC50 value)
compared to control cells treated with 0.5% DMSO in
medium plus 10% FBS were derived by interpolation of

Cytotoxic drugs
COTI-2 was supplied by Critical Outcome
Technologies Inc. (London, Ontario). COTI-2 was dissolved
in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide stock solution and diluted in
medium plus FBS such that final DMSO concentrations
were 0.5-1.0% depending on the experiment. Cetuximab
was obtained from ImClone Systems (New York, NY).
Erlotinib was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn,
MA). Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), paclitaxel

DMS-114, DMS-153, and SHP-77 human SCLC
cells (1 × 105) were cultured for 24 h before the medium
was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium containing the
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 μM) (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 1 h the Z-VAD-FMK
medium was removed and an equal volume of 2X medium
(with Z-VAD-FMK, 20 μM) with or without COTI-2 was
added to the cells at the IC50 concentrations for each cell
line as follow: DMS-114 (51 nM), DMS-153 (73 nM),
and SHP-77 (156 nM). Control cells that did not receive
COTI-2 received 2X medium (with or without Z-VADFMK, 20 μM) only. The final solutions contained COTI-2
(at IC50), Z-VAD-FMK (0 or 10 μM), and RPMI-1640 +
10% FBS. After 24 h the cells were analyzed for apoptosis
as follows: Supernatant medium containing non-adherent
cells was collected. Adherent cells were rinsed with icecold PBS, trypsinized, and added to the non-adherent
fraction. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS,
re-precipitated by centrifugation, re-suspended (1000 cells/
μl) in binding buffer (140 mM NaCl2/2.5 mM CaCl2/10
mM HEPES) and a fraction (100 μl) incubated in the
dark with 10 μl propidium iodide (PI, 50 ng/ml, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) plus 2 μl Annexin V-FITC (25 ng/ml; BD
Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario). Samples were analyzed
for combined Annexin V-FITC/PI staining (to detect late
apoptotic cells and post-apoptotic cells) using an EPICS
XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Hileah, FL).
Data was analyzed using CellQuest software.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured by the CellTiterBlue® cell viability assay Promega (Madison, WI). This
procedure measures the conversion of the indicator dye
resazurin to resorufin in metabolically active cells, hence is
an indicator of cell viability. Following treatment, growth
media was removed and cells were incubated with 20 ml
of CellTiter-Blue reagent and growth media for 1-4 h at
37°C. Fluorescence values were measured at 535/590 nm
using a Beckman-Coulter DTX-880 microplate reader
(Brea, CA).

Analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry
SHP-77 cells were cultured with various
concentrations of COTI-2 for 48 h. Cells were then
washed twice with 1X cold PBS and stained with Annexin
V and 7AAD (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 μl of Annexin
V and 7AAD were added to 1 × 105 cells and incubated
for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Then 400
μl of the 1X binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) was added to the cells.
Finally, cells were analyzed using a BD FACS Calibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylation of AKT,
STAT3, caspase-9, and cleavage of caspase-9

ATP-competitive KINOMEscanTM kinase assay
The interaction of COTI-2 with 227 kinases was
tested using the AMBIT BIOSCIENCES KINOMESCAN
assay (DiscoveRx Corp., Silver Spring, MD) as described
previously [41]. In brief, streptavidin-coated magnetic
beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands
for 30 min at 25°C to generate affinity resins for kinase
assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin
and washed with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% Tween
20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce
non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled
by combining phage lysates, liganded affinity beads, and
COTI-2 in 1X binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17X PBS,
0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). COTI-2 was prepared
as a 1,000X stock in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the
aqueous environment (0.1% DMSO final). DMSO (0.1%)
was added to control assays lacking the test compound. All
reactions were carried out in polystyrene 96-well plates
that had been pre-treated with blocking buffer in a final
volume of 0.1 ml. The assay plates were incubated at 25°C
with shaking for 1 h, long enough for binding reactions to
reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed 4X
with wash buffer (1X PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1mM DTT).
After the final wash, the beads were re-suspended in elution

Cell extracts were prepared from SHP-77 cells and
treated with COTI-2 (250 nM) or an equivalent volume of
the DMSO suspension vehicle. Cells were incubated for
3 or 6 h, washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS, harvested,
and sonicated. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at
15000X RPM for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant
collected and stored at -80°C. A Bradford protein assay
(BioRad, Hercules, CA) was used to measure protein
concentrations. The proteins were then separated by
electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane
(Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes
were incubated with various primary antibodies, and
then secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase.
The signal was visualized using a Storm scanner (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). The following antibodies, all
from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA),
were used to detect the proteins on the membrane: antiAkt2 (#2962), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473, #587F11), antiSTAT3 (#9132), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705, #9138S),
anti-caspase-8 (1C12), anti-cleaved caspase-9 (Asp330,
#9501), anti-phospho caspase-9 (Thr125, #2226S), and
anti-β tubulin (#2128).

(n= 5 mice per group). In the case of SHP-77 xenografts,
treatment with COTI-2 began prior to the appearance of
palpable tumors (i.e., the capacity of COTI-2 to suppress
growth of nascent tumors was assessed). One day after
injection of SHP-77 cells, animals received either 3 mg/
kg of COTI-2 (once every two days, up to 38 days), 12.5
mg/kg of paclitaxel in 0.5 ml isotonic saline (once every
two days, up to 38 days) [44], or 3 mg/kg of cisplatin in
isotonic saline (once per week for four weeks) IP [45].
Tumor sizes were estimated at 5, 10, 17, 24, and 38 days,
by standard caliper measurements. In the case of HT-29
xenografts, the capacity of COTI-2 to suppress growth
of established tumors was assessed. HT-29 xenografts
were allowed to grow to 200 mm3 before starting IP
treatment with COTI-2 (10 mg/kg, 5 days a week for 7
weeks) or saline IP. Tumor growth was measured every
4 days by caliper measurement. U87-MG cells (2 × 106)
were injected in 50% matrigel subcutaneously (SC) into
the hind legs of nude mice (2 injection sites per animal).
Treatment with COTI-2 (8 mg/kg in isotonic saline) started
when U87-MG xenografts reached 200-300 mm3. Control
mice were treated with isotonic saline alone. Animals
were treated 3 times per week IP and tumor growth was
measured with caliper. MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells
(2 × 106) were injected into the flanks of 6-8 week old
SCID mice. Animals were divided into two groups (n=7
mice/group) as follows: Group 1 – oral gavage with
phosphate-citrate buffer alone (pH 2.3), 5 days per week,
100 μl per gavage, until tumors reached a maximum of 1
cm3; Group 2– oral gavage with COTI-2 (200 mg/kg in
phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 2.3), 5 days per week, 100 μl
per gavage, commencing the day the mean tumour volume
in this group reached 100-200 mm3. Tumor volumes in
each group were assessed by caliper measurement.
OVCAR-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells (7 × 106) were
injected SC over both thighs of 4-8 weeks old female NIH
III nu/nu mice (n = 10-16 mice per treatment group). When
tumors reached a palpable volume of approximately 75100 mm3, treatment with control vehicle (phosphate-citrate
buffer without COTI-2, pH 3) or with vehicle plus COTI-2
was initiated either IV (20 mg/kg, 3 times per week) or PO
(75 mg/kg, 5 times per week). Treatments were continued
until tumors in mice treated with control vehicle reached
the maximum volume allowable according to the animal
care guidelines described by the Canadian Council on
Animal Care and monitored by The Western University
Animal Use Subcommittee, or maximum permissible
measures and markers of discomfort were reached (i.e.,
mouse discomfort or body weight loss reached maximum
allowable levels). Tumor volumes were examined using
caliper measurements.
All tumor volumes in this study were estimated
from caliper measurements of length and width then
calculated as follow: π/6 × (longest diameter) × (shortest
diameter)2. Animal handling and procedures were
conducted according to the animal experimentation guide

Radiometric functional kinase assay
In the radiometric based filtration binding assay, the
kinase reaction is performed in the presence radioisotope
labelled γ-ATP which is incorporated into the kinase
substrate that is then detected after washing away
unreacted phosphate [43]. The advantage of this method
is that it can be used for any kinase and substrate without
limitation since it does not rely on special substrate
labeling or modification and detection is free from
interference. Each substrate was prepared in fresh reaction
buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.02% Brij35, 0.02 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM Na3V04,
2 mM DTT, and 1% DMSO). Required cofactors and test
kinases were each added to the aforementioned substrate
solution and mixed gently. The target compounds in 100%
DMSO were diluted to the appropriate concentration into
the kinase reaction mixture using Acoustic Technology
(Echo550; nanoliter range). Then 33P-γ-ATP was added
to initiate the reaction and incubated for 2 h at room
temperature. The kinase activity was detected by P81
filter-binding
method
(http://reactionbiology.com/
webapps/site/Kinase_Assay_Protocol.aspx).

Inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity
The ability of test compounds to compete with
a fluorescently labelled probe for binding to full-length
recombinant human Hsp90 was determined by means of
a suited fluorescence polarization assay, as previously
described [43]. The assay is based on the competition
of fluorescently-labeled geldanamycin (FITC-GM) for
binding to Hsp90. FITC-GM binds to the ATP-binding
pocket of Hsp90, therefore, ATP-competitive inhibitors
can be identified using this assay. COTI-2 was tested
in a 10-dose IC50 in duplicate with 3-fold serial dilution
starting at 100 µM against Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Control
compounds radicicol and geldanamycin were tested in a
10-dose IC50 with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 10 µM.

In vivo xenograft studies
SHP-77 and HT-29 cells were injected in 50%
matrigel (ECM gel, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) into
flanks of NCr-nu mice (2 × 106 cells per injection site)
