Abstract
Tamoxifen is an anticancer drug that induces oxidative stress
and apoptosis via mitochondria-dependent and nitric oxide
(NO)–dependent pathways. The present report shows that
tamoxifen increases intramitochondrial ionized Ca2+ concentration and stimulates mitochondrial NO synthase (mtNOS)
activity in the mitochondria from rat liver and human breast
cancer MCF-7 cells. By stimulating mtNOS, tamoxifen hampers
mitochondrial respiration, releases cytochrome c, elevates
mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, increases protein tyrosine
nitration of certain mitochondrial proteins, decreases the
catalytic activity of succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase,
and induces aggregation of mitochondria. The present report
suggests a critical role for mtNOS in apoptosis induced by
tamoxifen. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1282–90]

Introduction
Tamoxifen is a cancer chemotherapeutic agent of a drug family
known as estrogen receptor (ER) modulators. Tamoxifen exerts ER
antagonistic and agonistic properties in various cells and tissues
(1–3). Many cancer chemotherapeutic agents (4), including
tamoxifen (5), exert their anticancer properties by inducing
apoptosis through mechanisms that involve mitochondria. Therapeutic doses of tamoxifen are 150 to 300 Ag d 1 kg 1 body weight
with an average therapeutic blood concentration of 120 ng/mL that
is equal to 0.3 Amol/L (6). Treatment of isolated rat liver
mitochondria with 20 to 100 Amol/L tamoxifen, concentrations
60 to 300 times greater than the therapeutic, inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (7). Likewise, these high
concentrations of tamoxifen increased the mitochondrial respiration and proton permeability and decreased mitochondrial
transmembrane potential (Dw) and oxidative phosphorylation
(8, 9), typifying uncoupling mitochondria. The present study tested
the effect of submicromolar concentrations of tamoxifen on
mitochondria.
Tamoxifen induces apoptosis in both ER-positive and ERnegative cells via nitric oxide (NO)–dependent pathways (10).
Tamoxifen increased the NO synthase (NOS) activity in 10T1/2
murine fibroblasts (11) and in human erythroleukemia K562 cells
undergoing apoptosis induced by tamoxifen (10). Moreover,
exogenously added NO-potentiated tamoxifen-induced apoptosis
and inhibition of NOS activity prevented the apoptosis induced by

tamoxifen (10). We have shown that mitochondria possess a
NOS [mitochondrial NOS (mtNOS)] that generates NO in response
to elevation of intramitochondrial ionized Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]m; refs. 12, 13). NO generated by mtNOS regulates
mitochondrial bioenergetics via reversible regulation of cytochrome oxidase activity (12, 13). mtNOS-derived NO also generates
peroxynitrite that induces oxidative stress and apoptosis (13). The
present study investigated the function of mtNOS for oxidative
stress and apoptosis induced by tamoxifen. It was found that
tamoxifen increases [Ca2+]m that stimulates mtNOS activity of
isolated rat liver mitochondria and human breast cancer MCF-7
cells. It was found that tamoxifen also induces oxidative stress and
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by mechanisms
resembling mtNOS-derived peroxynitrite formation.

Materials and Methods
Mitochondria and mitochondrial subfraction preparations. Liver
mitochondria were purified from female Sprague-Dawley rats as described
(14). The purity of the mitochondria was verified by measuring the
cytochrome a content at 605 to 630 nm using the extinction coefficient of
12 mmol/L 1 cm 1 (14). Only mitochondria with <5% impurity were used in
this study. Broken mitochondria were prepared from freshly isolated intact
mitochondria by freeze-thawing followed by hypoosmolar shock as
described (12, 14).
Mitochondria and cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells were isolated as described
(15). Briefly, after washing cells twice in PBS, protease inhibitor cocktail
[aprotinin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and
leupeptin (10 Amol/L each); refs. 13, 15] was added and cells were
homogenized with 20 to 30 strokes with a glass homogenizer while
visualizing microscopically to avoid overhomogenizing that damages the
mitochondria. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000  g and the
pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000  g for
30 min and the crude cytoplasmic (supernatant) and mitochondrial
(pellet) fractions were separated. The crude cytoplasmic fraction was
centrifuged at 100,000  g and the cytoplasm (supernatant) was collected.
Mitochondria were purified from crude mitochondria fraction by 20%
Percoll purification at 100,000  g followed by rinsing twice in cold
buffer.
Incubation procedure for liver mitochondria. Unless mentioned
otherwise, intact or broken mitochondria [1 mg protein in 100 AL HEPES
buffer (100 mmol/L; pH 7.10)] were incubated with 100 Amol/L N Nmonomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; to inhibit mtNOS; ref. 14) or 100 Amol/L
glutathione monoethyl ester (GME; to supplement mitochondria with
glutathione; ref. 16) for 30 min on ice. After this incubation time, tamoxifen
(0.1 or 0.5 Amol/L) or equal volume of its solvent (ethanol) was added and
mitochondria were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with
occasional gentle shaking. When used, horse heart cytochrome c (680 pmol;
ref. 17) was added immediately before tamoxifen.
Incubation procedure for MCF-7 cells. Cells were cultured in phenol
red–free DMEM. At 80% confluence, cells were passaged using 5% trypsin
and 0.03% EDTA and seeded at 1  106 cells/mL. At f80% confluence, cells
were treated with tamoxifen (0.1–10 Amol/L; ref. 18) in the absence or

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Liver mitochondria samples were
suspended in a final volume of 1 mL HEPES buffer, respiration was
supported by K+-succinate (0.8 mmol/L), and the oxygen consumption was
determined using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA) as described (14).
NOS activity. NOS activity was determined by citrulline assay,
NO-sensitive electrode (World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL; Apollo
4000), and NO chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers 280i, General Electric,
Boulder, CO) as described (14). For citrulline assay, liver mitochondria
were incubated as under incubation procedure for liver mitochondria,

whereas buffer was supplemented with 30,000 to 50,000 cpm L[3H]arginine. At the end of the incubation, mtNOS activity was terminated
by adding ice-chilled stop solution [2 mmol/L EDTA and 1 mmol/L
unlabeled L-citrulline in 20 mmol/L Na+-acetate buffer (pH 5.00)]. Samples
were run through Dowex columns prepared as described (14), and mtNOS
activity was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the effluent. To
measure mtNOS activity with the NO electrode, 1 mg broken
mitochondria incubated as under incubation procedure for liver
mitochondria were added to the HEPES buffer (1,000 AL final volume)

interfere with the signal detected by the NO electrode. To measure NOS
activity in MCF-7 cells, their cytoplasm or mitochondria, samples were
injected into the purge vessel containing vanadium chloride (0.8% in 1
mol/L HCl) thermostated at 95jC and the chemiluminescence of the NO
released was measured using the NO analyzer (Sievers 280i). The vessel
was depleted of oxygen by purging with N2 at least 20 min before
injecting the samples and during the entire measurement. NaNO2 was
used to prepare the standard curve.
[Ca2+]m determination. [Ca2+]m was done at 675 to 685 nm in the
presence of Arsenazo III (5 Amol/L) by using an Aminco DW-2000
spectrophotometer (17, 19), by a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Accumet-Fisher
Scientific, Hanover Park, IL; ref. 20) and by fluorometery using the Ca2+sensitive fluorescent probe, fura-2 (21, 22). In the former assay, carbonyl
cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp; 1 Amol/L) was added to the intact
mitochondria samples to collapse the Dw and allow the [Ca2+]m to
equilibrate with extra mitochondrial buffer. The same approach was taken
with the Ca2+ electrode, except 50 nmol/L antimycin A (AA) was added to
collapse the Dw because cccp interfered with the signal detected by the
electrode. The [Ca2+]m was also measured in broken mitochondria. No cccp
or AA was added to the broken mitochondria preparation. Standard curves
were obtained by using known concentrations of Ca2+ added to the broken
mitochondria suspensions. Tamoxifen or L-NMMA at the concentrations
used in this study did not interfere with the Ca2+ signal detected by either
method.
Both [Ca2+]m detection assays are very sensitive; however, they require
larger amounts of mitochondria than can be obtained from cultured cells.
Therefore, the Ca2+ fluorescent probe fura-2 was used and a series of
experiments was conducted to establish a sensitive assay to measure
[Ca2+]m in very small amounts of mitochondria. Fura-2 (the active form) in
the absence or presence of Ca2+ was excited from 320 to 400 nm and
emission was collected at 510 nm using an Aminco DW-2000 dual-beam
dual-wavelength spectrophotometer equipped with original Aminco fluorescent unit. A clear peak and a sharp isosbestic point were detected at
352 and 362 nm, respectively. Next, isolated mitochondria were loaded with
the membrane-permeable fura-2/acetoxymethylester ( fura-2/AM; 15 min
followed by twice wash in cold buffer), excited from 320 to 400 nm, and
emission was collected at 510 nm. Identical peak and isosbestic point of 352
and 362 nm were detected. To do a highly sensitive [Ca2+]m measurement,
fura-2-loaded mitochondria were excited at dual wavelengths of peak minus
isosbestic point (352–362 nm) and emission was detected at 510 nm. A
[Ca2+]m-dependent fluorescence was successfully obtained. This sensitive
dual-wavelength excitation fluorometric assay was used to test the [Ca2+]m
of mitochondria of MCF-7 cells.
Mitochondrial #y. The Dw of intact liver mitochondria was supported
by K+-succinate (800 Amol/L) and measured at 511 to 533 nm in the
presence of 10 Amol/L safranin as described (13, 17).
Cytochrome c release and lipid peroxidation. Cytochrome c was
determined by Western blot using monoclonal anti–cytochrome c antibody
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA) as described (13, 17). Lipid peroxidation (LPO)
was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
(TBARS) at 535 nm as described (13).
Protein tyrosine nitration. Samples were lysed in 100 AL lyses buffer
containing 133 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.00), 0.1% SDS, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% NP40, and protease inhibitors (10 Amol/L each):
PMSF, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Proteins (20 Ag) of each sample
were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose
membrane, probed with monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Alexis
Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) or monoclonal anti–cytochrome oxidase
subunit VIc antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as loading control,
and visualized with alkaline phosphatase.
Activity of succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase. Liver mitochondria samples were thrice frozen-thawed in liquid nitrogen followed by
addition of ice-cold H2O ( four times the volume of mitochondria
suspension) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin-A, and PMSF; 10 Amol/L each) to fully rupture mitochondrial
membranes (14). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000  g at 4jC
for 30 min and the supernatant [soluble fraction (SF)] was collected. One

succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT) catalytic activity was
measured by following the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA at 313 nm as
described (23).
Mitochondria aggregation. Aggregation of liver mitochondria was
studied as described (24) by using a light microscope (BalPlanBausch&Lomb, Rochester, NY) connected to a digital camera (Nikon
Coolpix 4500, Nikon, Koga Ku, Japan). Mitochondria samples (3 Ag
mitochondrial protein/AL) were placed on a Petroff-Hausser counting
chamber with 20 Am cell depth (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA).
Tamoxifen (0.1 and 0.5 Amol/L) or its solvent (control) was added and
microphotographs were taken in triplicate every 5 min.

Results and Discussion
Apoptosis is a fundamental mechanism that regulates cell and
tissue homeostasis and eliminates cancer cells (25). It is generally
believed that insufficient apoptosis causes cancer (26). Many
cancer chemotherapeutic agents (4), including tamoxifen (5, 27),
induce oxidative stress and apoptosis via mechanisms that involve
mitochondria and NO (10, 11). We (12) and several other
laboratories (refs. 27–31; reviewed in ref. 32) have shown that
mitochondria generate NO through the Ca2+-sensitive mtNOS.
Stimulation of mtNOS leads to formation of peroxynitrite that
induces oxidative stress (33) and mitochondrial apoptosis (13). The
present study investigated the function of mtNOS for tamoxifeninduced oxidative stress and apoptosis.
Tamoxifen increases mtNOS activity, decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and increases [Ca2+]m. Figure 1A
shows that submicromolar concentrations of tamoxifen increased

www.aacrjournals.org

mtNOS activity of intact isolated rat liver mitochondria and that
this effect of tamoxifen was prevented with L-NMMA. Figure 1B
shows that NO formation by broken mitochondria was increased
by tamoxifen and that this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when
mtNOS was inhibited with L-NMMA, or [Ca2+]m was removed by
EGTA. An L-NMMA– and EGTA-sensitive increase in NO formation
of broken mitochondria was also observed for 0.1 Amol/L
tamoxifen (data not shown). These results indicate that tamoxifen
stimulates mtNOS activity of rat liver mitochondria. NO is the
pharmacologic competitive antagonist of O2 (i.e., NO reversibly
decreases mitochondrial respiration by competing with O2 for the
O2 binding site of cytochrome oxidase; ref. 34). Several reports have
shown that NO produced by mtNOS decreases mitochondrial O2
consumption (12, 13). Thus, the present study tested the effect of
tamoxifen on mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Figure 1C shows
that tamoxifen decreased the oxygen consumption of intact liver
mitochondria. Some studies suggested that tamoxifen increased
the oxygen consumption of mitochondria (7–9). This can be
explained by considering that those studies used 20 to 100 Amol/L
tamoxifen, which is 60 to 300 times >0.3 Amol/L, the submicromolar concentration of tamoxifen (6). Tamoxifen is highly
lipophilic and high concentrations of lipophilic compounds readily
increase mitochondrial respiration by perturbing the mitochondrial
membrane integrity and uncoupling the mitochondria. Figure 1C
shows that the decrease of mitochondrial oxygen consumption was
prevented when mtNOS was inhibited by L-NMMA. This finding
indicates that tamoxifen decreased the mitochondrial oxygen
consumption by stimulating mtNOS activity. Figure 1C shows that
tamoxifen also decreased the respiration of broken mitochondria
and that this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when [Ca2+]m was
chelated by EGTA. This finding together with those presented in

Fig. 1B strongly suggest that tamoxifen increases mtNOS activity by
increasing [Ca2+]m.
Next, the effect of tamoxifen on NO formation by human breast
cancer MCF-7 cells and their mitochondria was tested. Figure 1D
shows that whereas tamoxifen did not increase the cellular NOS
activity in MCF-7 cells, tamoxifen caused a dramatic increase
(>500%) in the NOS activity of MCF-7 mitochondria. These findings
indicate tamoxifen increases the mtNOS activity in human breast
cancer cells.
Mitochondria contain sufficient substrates and cofactors that
mtNOS requires, and elevation of [Ca2+]m per se stimulates
the mtNOS activity (12, 13, 30, 31). Because tamoxifen increased
the mtNOS activity and this effect of tamoxifen was inhibited when
[Ca2+]m was removed, the present study tested whether tamoxifen
increases [Ca2+]m. Figure 2A shows that tamoxifen increased the
[Ca2+]m stored in intact liver mitochondria. Figure 2A also shows
that L-NMMA did not alter the effect of tamoxifen on [Ca2+]m,
indicating that the increased [Ca2+]m efflux was not due to
decreasing the Dw by mtNOS-derived NO (12, 19). To rule out
possible direct effect of tamoxifen on Ca2+ transport system of
intact mitochondria, the effect of tamoxifen on broken mitochondria was tested. Figure 2B shows that tamoxifen increased the Ca2+
concentration in broken mitochondria and that L-NMMA did not
alter this effect of tamoxifen. Elevation of [Ca2+]m neutralizes the

negative charges of the inner mitochondrial membrane and
decreases the Dw. Thus, the present study tested the effect of
tamoxifen on Dw. Figure 2C shows that tamoxifen decreased
the Dw and that this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when
[Ca2+]m was chelated by EGTA. This finding further supports the
findings presented in Fig 2A and B and indicates that tamoxifen
increases the [Ca2+]m in liver mitochondria.
To detect [Ca2+]m in small amounts of mitochondria obtained
from MCF-7 cells, the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fura-2 was
used (21, 22). fura-2 (the active form) in the absence (no Ca2+) or
presence of Ca2+ (1–50 Amol/L) was excited and emission was
collected at 510 nm (35), and a clear peak and a sharp isosbestic
point were detected at 352 and 362 nm, respectively (Fig. 3A). Next,
liver mitochondria were loaded with membrane-permeable fura2AM, excited, and emission was collected at 510 nm. Identical peak
and isosbestic points of 352 and 362 nm were detected (Fig. 3B). To
do highly sensitive [Ca2+]m measurement, fura-2-loaded mitochondria were excited at dual wavelengths of peak minus isosbestic
point (352–362 nm) and emission was collected at 510 nm. A
[Ca2+]m-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed when
[Ca2+]m was increased by loading mitochondria with Ca2+ (Fig. 3C).
No autofluorescence was observed when mitochondria not loaded
with fura-2 were excited in the absence or presence of 1 to
10 Amol/L Ca2+ (data not shown). Figure 3C also shows that the

Scheme. Mitochondria, mtNOS, and tamoxifen. Mitochondria consist of the inner (IM ) and the outer membrane (OM ), matrix, and the intermembrane space (IMS ).
The respiratory chain consists of four complexes (I–IV), coenzyme Q (Q; ubiquinone), and ATP synthase also called complex V, which are embedded in the IM.
Electrons (e ) flow down the chain to complex IV and reduce O2 to H2O. Coupled to the electron flow, protons (H+) are pumped from the matrix into the IMS. The
proton extrusion establishes a transmembrane potential (Dw ; negative inside) and an electrochemical gradient (DpH; alkaline inside) across the coupling membrane.
The Dw is the driving force for mitochondria to take up Ca2+. Whereas mitochondria take up relatively large quantities of Ca2+, intramitochondrial ionized Ca2+
concentration ([Ca2+]m) is maintained very low by mechanisms, including precipitation of the [Ca2+]m to nonionized calcium pools, the matrix electron-dense granules.
Mitochondria generate NO through the mtNOS. mtNOS is Ca2+ sensitive and elevation of [Ca2+]m stimulates the mtNOS activity. mtNOS-derived NO reversibly
inhibits mitochondrial respiration by competing with O2 for the O2 binding site on complex IV. mtNOS-derived NO also reacts with superoxide anion (O2 ) to produce
peroxynitrite (ONOO ). Peroxynitrite induces cytochrome c release, elevates LPO, and nitrates tyrosine residues of susceptible proteins, including SCOT. Tamoxifen
affects intramitochondrial calcium homeostasis by shifting the mitochondrial nonionized/ionized calcium equilibrium in the favor of the ionized form. Elevated
[Ca2+]m stimulates mtNOS that increases intramitochondrial ONOO that induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis.

shown). Using this assay, the present study tested the effect of
tamoxifen on [Ca2+]m of MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3D,
tamoxifen, indeed, increased the [Ca2+]m in the mitochondria of
MCF-7 cells. Different Y axes scales have been used in Fig. 3. Figure
3A and B where single-wavelength excitation spectra were used
have same scales that are different from those used in Fig. 3C and
D where excitation was done at dual wavelengths of 352 362 nm.
As shown, 5 Amol/L Ca2+ caused an increase in fluorescence of
f0.1 unit on Fig. 3B, whereas 4 Amol/L Ca2+ generated an increase
in fluorescence of f1 unit in Fig. 3C, indicating at least one order
of magnitude increased sensitivity when dual-wavelength excitation was used. The scale of Fig. 3C is different from Fig. 3D because
1 mg rat liver mitochondria was used in Fig. 3C, whereas Fig. 3D
used 10 Ag mitochondria of human epithelial breast cancer cells.
Mitochondria take up and accommodate large amounts of
calcium very rapidly; however, [Ca2+]m is maintained very low by
precipitating the [Ca2+]m to the matrix electron-dense granules

(36, 37). Mitochondria maintain a dynamic intraorganelle calcium
homeostasis (i.e., [Ca2+]m precipitates to and releases from the
matrix granules; refs. 37, 38). Drugs, hormones, or pathologic
conditions alter the balance between precipitation of [Ca2+]m to the
granules and release of Ca2+ from the granules (36–38). For
example, vasopressin decreases the matrix calcium granules in the
mitochondria of neurons (38). Hypoxia increases the matrix
granules and decreases the [Ca2+]m (37), and overexpression of
protein kinase C-y significantly decreases the [Ca2+]m (39). Findings
presented in the present study suggest that tamoxifen shifts the
balance between [Ca2+]m and matrix granules in the favor of
[Ca2+]m; elevated [Ca2+]m stimulates mtNOS activity and increases
mitochondrial NO formation (Scheme).
Mitochondria are one of the main cellular producers of O2 .
Between 2% and 5% of the entire electrons flowing down through
the mitochondrial inner membrane leaks out and generates O2
(29, 40). NO reacts with O2 with the nearly diffusion-controlled rate
constant of 1.9  1010 mol/L s 1 to produce peroxynitrite (41).
Within the mitochondria, mtNOS-derived NO use up to 15% of the
entire O2 generated by the mitochondrial inner membrane (33)
and produces peroxynitrite (13, 30, 31, 42) with the extremely rapid
rate of 9.5  10 8 mol/L s 1 (33). Results presented in this study
indicate that tamoxifen increases mitochondrial NO formation.
Thus, it was tested whether tamoxifen increases mitochondrial
peroxynitrite.
Tamoxifen releases cytochrome c and elevates LPO.
Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is one of the
key events during most forms of apoptosis, including that
induced by tamoxifen (43). Stimulation of mtNOS increases
mitochondrial peroxynitrite that releases cytochrome c from the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

mitochondria (13). mtNOS stimulation also increases LPO that is
a widely used peroxynitrite biomarker (13, 44). Figure 4A and B
shows that tamoxifen released cytochrome c from liver
mitochondria and increased LPO and that those effects of
tamoxifen were prevented when mtNOS was inhibited. These
findings suggest that tamoxifen released the cytochrome c and
elevated LPO by stimulating mtNOS. To test whether these
effects of tamoxifen were mediated by peroxynitrite, mitochondria were supplemented with glutathione. Supplementing mitochondria with glutathione prevented the apoptosis induced by
tamoxifen (45) and decreased the oxidative damage induced by
peroxynitrite (46–48). Elegant work of Nakamura et al. (46) has
shown that glutathione reverses the peroxynitrite-induced
oxidative damage by converting peroxynitrite to S-nitrosating
species (47). Figure 4A and B shows that supplementing
mitochondria with glutathione prevented tamoxifen-induced
release of cytochrome c and increase of LPO. Supplementing
cells with cytochrome c prevents apoptosis induced by tamoxifen
(45) and supplementing mitochondria with cytochrome c
prevents elevated LPO induced by mtNOS-derived peroxynitrite
(13). Figure 4B shows that supplementing mitochondria with
cytochrome c prevented tamoxifen-induced LPO elevation. These
findings strongly suggest that tamoxifen increases peroxynitrite
in liver mitochondria.
The present study also tested whether tamoxifen elevates LPO in
MCF-7 cells. Figure 4C shows that whereas tamoxifen did not
increase LPO in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells, there was a
substantial increase in LPO of mitochondria of MCF-7 cells.
Tamoxifen-induced increase in mitochondrial LPO was fully
abolished when MCF-7 cells were treated with a NOS inhibitor.

Tamoxifen Stimulates mtNOS

These findings strongly suggest that tamoxifen increases peroxynitrite in the mitochondria of MCF-7 cells.
Tamoxifen increases protein tyrosine nitration and
decreases SCOT activity. Peroxynitrite readily reacts with tyrosine
residues to produce nitrotyrosine. Determination of protein
tyrosine nitration has been widely used as a reliable peroxynitrite
biomarker (49). Figure 5A shows that tamoxifen increased the
tyrosine nitration of certain liver mitochondrial proteins and that
this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when mtNOS was inhibited.
This finding further suggest that tamoxifen increases mitochondrial peroxynitrite via stimulating mtNOS. Figure 5A shows
substantial increase in the tyrosine nitration of a protein with
molecular weight of f50 kDa. SCOT is a 52-kDa mitochondrial
matrix protein that is involved in energy production in malignant
cells (50) and undergoes peroxynitrite-induced tyrosine nitration
(23). Figure 5B shows that tamoxifen decreased the activity of
SCOT and that this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when
mtNOS was inhibited. This finding suggests that the 50-kDa
tyrosine-nitrated protein shown in Fig. 5A is SCOT. Figure 5A
and B also shows that supplementing mitochondria with
glutathione or cytochrome c prevented tamoxifen-induced increase
in protein tyrosine nitration and decrease in the SCOT activity,
which confirms the results presented in Fig. 4A and B and further
indicate tamoxifen increases mitochondrial peroxynitrite.
Tamoxifen induces aggregation of mitochondria. Mitochondrial movement and morphology alter under different conditions
(51). During early stages of apoptosis, mitochondria form aggregates,
and mitochondrial aggregation precedes the release of cytochrome c
(52). It has been shown that peroxynitrite causes mitochondrial
aggregation followed by release of cytochrome c (53). Because the
results presented thus far strongly suggest that tamoxifen increases
mtNOS-derived peroxynitrite formation, the present study tested

whether tamoxifen induces mitochondrial aggregation. Figure 6
shows that tamoxifen induced extensive aggregation of isolated liver
mitochondria and that this effect of tamoxifen was prevented when
mtNOS was inhibited or when were supplemented with glutathione.
These novel findings suggest that tamoxifen-induced mitochondrial
aggregation was mediated by mtNOS-derived peroxynitrite. Figure 6
also shows that supplementing mitochondria with cytochrome c
prevented mitochondrial aggregation. This finding confirms the
previous reports (27, 52, 53) and further suggests that the release of
cytochrome c precedes the aggregation of mitochondria.
Taken together, the present study shows that submicromolar
concentrations of tamoxifen stimulate mtNOS activity by elevating
[Ca2+]m (Scheme). Tamoxifen-induced mtNOS stimulation increases
mitochondrial peroxynitrite, which causes oxidative and nitrative
stress. NO generated in the cytoplasm exerts antiapoptotic
properties by mechanisms involving caspase S-nitrosation, whereas
NO produced within the mitochondria becomes proapoptotic by
generating peroxynitrite (42). Findings presented in the present
study strongly suggest that tamoxifen increases mitochondrial
peroxynitrite.
These findings suggest a pivotal role for mtNOS in oxidative stress
and apoptosis induced by tamoxifen and propose a novel mechanism for the action of a widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agent.
