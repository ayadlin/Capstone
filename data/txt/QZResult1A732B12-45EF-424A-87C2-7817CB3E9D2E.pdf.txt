Abstract
During childhood, the thyroid gland is one of the most sensitive organs to the carcinogenetic effects of
ionizing radiation that may lead to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) associated with RET/PTC oncogene
rearrangement. Exposure to ionizing radiation induces a transient “oxidative burst” through radiolysis of
water, which can cause DNA damage and mediates part of the radiation effects. H2O2 is a potent DNAdamaging agent that induces DNA double-strand breaks, and consequently, chromosomal aberrations. Irradiation by 5 Gy X-ray increased extracellular H2O2. Therefore, we investigated the implication of H2O2 in the
generation of RET/PTC1 rearrangement after X-ray exposure. We developed a highly specific and sensitive
nested reverse transcription-PCR method. By using the human thyroid cell line HTori-3, previously found
to produce RET/PTC1 after γ-irradiation, we showed that H2O2, generated during a 5 Gy X-ray irradiation,
causes DNA double-strand breaks and contributes to RET/PTC1 formation. Pretreatment of cells with catalase,
a scavenger of H2O2, significantly decreased RET/PTC1 rearrangement formation. Finally, RET/PTC chromosomal rearrangement was detected in HTori-3.1 cells after exposure of cells to H2O2 (25 μmol/L), at a dose
that did not affect the cell viability. This study shows for the first time that H2O2 is able to cause RET/PTC1
rearrangement in thyroid cells and consequently highlights that oxidative stress could be responsible for the
occurrence of RET/PTC1 rearrangement found in thyroid lesions even in the absence of radiation exposure.

Introduction
Chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene
(REarranged during Transfection) are highly prevalent in
papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) occurring after childhood
exposure either to environmental radiation after the Chernobyl accident or to medical external radiation (1–4). In the
normal thyroid gland, RET which encodes the tyrosine kinase
receptor for growth factors belonging to the glial-derived
neurotrophilic factor family, is expressed only in parafollicular thyroid cells. The recombination of the intracellular
kinase encoding domain of the RET gene with a heterologous
gene expressed ubiquitously generates RET/PTC chimeric
oncogene proteins that are expressed in follicular thyroid

cells. These chimeric proteins are constitutively active (1, 2).
RET/PTC1, which is the most frequent rearrangement, is the
result of the fusion of RET and CCDC6 genes from a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 10 with
breakpoints in q11.2 and q21 [inv(10) (q11.2q21); ref. 5].
Despite the fact that RET and CCDC6 genes are 30 mb apart,
their high spatial proximity in interphase nuclei in normal thyroid cells was thought to promote their recombination (6, 7).
External radiation during childhood increases the risk of
thyroid tumors, either benign or malignant (1–4, 8). More
than 90% of these cancers are papillary, presenting a RET/
PTC rearrangement in 70% of cases. Several in vitro and
in vivo studies have shown that exposure to ionizing radiation induces RET/PTC rearrangement. Thus, using a nested
PCR assay, RET/PTC1 transcripts were detected in a human
undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line (8505C) after
exposure to 50 Gy of X-rays (9). RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3
were detected in human thyroid tissues transplanted in
severe combined immunodeficiency mice and submitted to
X-ray irradiation (10). More recently, RET/PTC rearrangements were induced in immortalized human thyroid cells
(HTori-3) after exposure to γ-radiation in a dose-dependent
manner (11). These results strongly support the direct role of
radiation exposure in RET/PTC generation.
Ionizing radiation exposure induces a transient “oxidative
burst” through water radiolysis (12) that generates H2O2, and
in turn, H2O2 could cause DNA damage and mediate part of

the radiation effects (12). H2O2 can induce DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB) and consequently chromosomal aberrations (13–16).
In this study, we show for the first time that H2O2 produced during irradiation but also when it is added to the cell
medium, causes RET/PTC1 chromosomal rearrangements in
human thyroid cells. Consequently, oxidative stress could be
responsible through the generation of H2O2 for the occurrence of RET/PTC1 rearrangements that may lead to thyroid
tumors, even in the absence of radiation exposure.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture conditions
The human thyroid epithelial cell line (HTori-3), purchased from the European Tissue Culture collection, was
grown in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Inc.), supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10% (v/v)
FCS (PAA Laboratories). The human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell line (TPC-1) was cultured in the same medium.
The human embryo lung fibroblast (MRC5) cell line, kindly
given by Dr. Fillippo Rosselli (FRE 2939, Centre National de
la Recherche Scientifique, Villejuif, France), was cultured in
phenol red–free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1%
(v/v) antibiotics/antimycotics, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine,
1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 10% FCS.
Normal human thyroid tissue specimens were collected at
Institut Gustave Roussy in accordance with local and national
ethics laws. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Primary human thyrocytes were cultured as previously
described (17).
Expression of thyroid differentiation markers
Total RNA from cells was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and reverse transcription was done as previously
described (17). cDNA was then amplified by 40 temperature
cycles (95°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for
1 minute) in a GeneAmp 9600 apparatus and AmpliTaq
Gold's protocol (Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping
gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)
cDNA was amplified as a control. Selected primers are listed
in Table 1.
Transient cell transfection
HTori-3 cells reaching 50% to 60% confluence were transfected using JetPEI transfection reagent and the Polyplus
transfection protocol (Ozyme) with pHyPer-nuc or pHyPerCyto vector (Evrogen JSC). After 48 hours, the cells were
visualized by confocal microscopy.
Confocal fluorescence microscopy
pHyPer-transfected cells were plated on glass-bottomed
dishes, exposed to 5 Gy of X-ray irradiation or to 25 μmol/L
of H2O2, and immediately analyzed by confocal microscopy.
The fluorescence (excitation/emission, 488/530 nm) was examined under an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss).

Cell treatment
X-ray irradiation. In most experiments, 5 × 106 cells were
plated in a 175 cm2 flask and 16 hours later exposed to a
single dose of X-irradiation from an X-ray Generator operating at 200 KVe and 15 mA at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min. Just
before irradiation at room temperature, the cell medium was
replaced with fresh medium. Four hours after irradiation,
cells were collected by trypsinization and split into 10 sixwell plates at a density of ∼2.2 × 104 cells per well, grown
for 15 days, and harvested.
Hydrogen peroxide. For RET/PTC1 detection, 5 × 106 cells
were plated in a 175 cm2 flask and 16 hours later exposed to
25 μmol/L of H2O2 in serum-free medium for 1 hour at 37°C.
Four hours later, cells were collected by trypsinization and
split into 10 six-well plates at a density of ∼2.2 × 104 cells
per well, grown for 15 days, and harvested.
Detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements
The Total RNA from irradiated cells cultured in sixwell plates was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA II kit
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. The integrity and purity of each RNA sample was verified
with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Biotechnologies).
The RET-specific reverse transcription was achieved by using
a gene-specific primer (RT-RET-994) in the presence of
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The first and the nested PCR were carried out with
35 cycles in the respective conditions (95°C for 30 seconds,
58°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute) and (95°C for
30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds) in
a GeneAmp 9600 apparatus using a protocol from AmpliTaq
(Applied Biosystems). For optimization of the first-round
PCR conditions, three target reverse transcriptions from
each sample were followed by three first PCRs. Briefly, 6 μg
of RNA from each sample was divided into 2 μg aliquots,
dispensed in 10 μL of reverse transcription buffer, and incubated for 120 minutes at 37°C according to the protocols of
the manufacturer. Each reaction mixture was then diluted
with 14 μL of the PCR buffer containing 0.5 units of Taq
DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Roche). The first-round
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products were pooled,
diluted 1:5, and then 5 μL were used for one nested PCR.
The PCR amplification products were analyzed with 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
The specificity of the amplification product with predicted
size was confirmed by EcoRI digestion. The primers used are
listed in Table 1.
Measurement of H2O2 generation
Production of H2O2 was determined by reaction with cellimpermeable 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex
Red reagent, Invitrogen) in the presence of excess peroxidase,
producing fluorescent resorufin. Briefly, HTori-3 cells were
plated into six-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 per well
in complete medium. Sixteen hours later, the cells were
washed twice with warm Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) without
CaCl2 and MgCl 2 (Invitrogen) and irradiated by 5 Gy of
X-ray in D-PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Invitrogen). Cell-free

assay was also performed in D-PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2.
At regular time intervals, 100 μL of irradiated medium aliquots were removed and kept on ice in the dark until H2O2
quantification. For H2O2 quantification, 100-μL aliquots were
mixed with 100 μL of a working solution of D-PBS with CaCl2
and MgCl2 containing 1 unit/mL of horseradish peroxidase,
2 mg/mL D-glucose and 100 μmol/L of Amplex Red and
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Relative fluorescence units (excitation/emission, 544/595 nm) measured
in a multiwell fluorescence plate reader (Wallac 1420 Victor2,
Perkin-Elmer) were converted into H2 O 2 concentrations
using a calibration curve.
Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species
The peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes)
was used to assess the generation of intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS). This compound is converted by intracellular esterases to 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, which
is then oxidized by intracellular ROS to the highly fluorescent
2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF). HTori-3 cells were
plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well into six-well
plates in complete culture medium. Sixteen hours later, the
cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 0.5 mL
of serum-free medium and incubated with 10 μmol/L
of DCFH-DA and with increased concentration of H2O2 for
1 hour at 37°C in serum-free medium in the dark. Fluorescence was recorded on FL-1 channel of FACSVantage SE
(Becton Dickinson). The cellular viability was assessed by
propidium iodide staining. For experiments with catalase,
HTori-3 cells were plated at a density of 105 cells per well
into 24-well plates in complete culture medium as described
above. Sixteen hours later, the cell culture medium was removed and the cells were treated or not with 100 units/mL
of catalase for 2 and 4 hours at 37°C in serum-free medium.
The cells were then washed twice with warm D-PBS without
CaCl2 and MgCl2 to remove residual catalase, and incubated

with 10 μmol/L of CM-H2DCFDA for 1 hour at 37°C in serumfree medium in the dark before being treated with 25 μmol/L
of H2O2. Relative fluorescence units (excitation/emission,
485/535 nm) were measured in a multiwell fluorescence plate
reader (Wallac 1420 Victor2, Perkin-Elmer).
Cell survival test
Cell proliferation/viability of HTori-3 cells (96-well plates;
3 × 104 cells/well) was quantified by means of a colorimetric
assay based on the reduction of the colorless tetrazolium salt
4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,
3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1, Roche Applied Science) to formazan, according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting procedures
Western blot analysis was performed with lysates prepared
as previously described (17). Primary antibody against phosphorylated Ser139 of histone H2AX (γH2AX) was purchased
from Millipore whereas total histone H2AX was purchased
from Abcam. The secondary antibodies used were, respectively, horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse (Santa
Cruz) and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antirabbit (Southern Biotech). Specific binding was detected by
the Enhancer Chemiluminescence system.
Statistical analysis
Data are means ± SEM. Student's t test was used with
P < 0.05 as the significant threshold.

structural chromosomal abnormalities, these cells present
some advantages: they have three intact copies of chromosome 10 with undisrupted RET locus and a high proliferation
rate, both increasing the probability of RET/PTC formation
after radiation exposure (11, 18). As previously shown, the
HTori-3 cell line expresses mRNA of thyroid differentiation
markers such as thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (TPO),
and TSH receptor, which are positively regulated by TSH
(Fig. 1A). Primary cultures of human thyrocytes were used
as a control. Unlike thyrocytes, HTori-3 cells did not produce
extracellular H2O2 under stimulated and nonstimulated conditions (data not shown).
Detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangement. To detect RET/
PTC1, we developed a highly specific and sensitive nested
RT-PCR method by using first a gene-specific primer for
reverse transcription and second two couples of primers
designed, respectively, from CCDC6 exon 2 and RET exon
12 (Table 1). Dilution experiments were carried out mixing
TPC-1 cells bearing the RET/PTC1 rearrangement with

untreated HTori-3 cells in which RET/PTC1 rearrangement
was undetectable (Table 2) to evaluate the sensitivity of the
method. RNA was extracted from the mixture and subjected
to nested RT-PCR. A 212 bp product could be detected from
the TPC-1 cells when mixed with HTori-3 cells at a ratio of
1:106 (Fig. 1B). The specificity of RET/PTC1-positive amplified
product was ascertained by EcoRI digestion of the PCR
products that resulted in the predicted fragments (Fig. 1C).
Then, RET/PTC1 rearrangement was sought in HTori-3 cells
after X-ray exposure. Representative ethidium bromidestained gels of RT-PCR products are shown in Fig. 1D. To
exclude the possibility of degradation of extracted RNA,
G3PDH was amplified from each sample using RT-PCR as
a control. Because the highest number of RET/PTC1 was observed after 5 Gy of γ-radiation in cells grown for 9 days after
irradiation (11), the cells were irradiated with a single dose
of 5 Gy X-ray, 4 hours later, seeded in six-well plates and collected after 15 days. In these conditions, RET/PTC1 rearrangement was detected in ∼20% of cell-containing wells

(mean, 20.53 ± 1.98; Table 2). Thus, we confirmed that the
HTori-3 cell line is a valuable in vitro model for studying
the mechanisms of RET/PTC1 generation. The RET/PTC1 signal intensity in the positive wells seemed comparable to the
signal in TPC1 lanes because the nested PCR conditions were
not compatible with quantification. Indeed, the initial, outer
primer PCR phase was not conducted in the exponential
phase. No transcripts of RET/PTC1 rearrangement were detectable in the nonthyroid irradiated MRC5 cell line and were
analyzed in the same experimental conditions of radiation
exposure (Table 2), showing that RET/PTC1 rearrangement
does not occur in fibroblasts.
Ionizing radiation exposure produces H2O2 in the
extracellular medium through radiolysis of water
Ionizing radiation exposure is known to induce a transient oxidative burst through radiolysis of water (12). The
concentration of H2O2 produced in the medium through
radiolysis of water after irradiation with 5 Gy of X-ray
was measured at different time intervals. In the absence of
cells, the concentration estimated at 12 μmol/L remained unchanged 30 minutes after irradiation (Fig. 2A). On the other
hand, in the presence of cells, H 2O 2 rapidly disappeared
and only 50% remained at 10 minutes after irradiation. The
addition of 100 units/mL of catalase, a scavenger of H2O2,
suppressed radiation-induced H2O2 formation in the cell
medium.
Pretreatment of thyroid cells by catalase decreases the
occurrence of DNA DSBs and of RET/PTC1
rearrangement after exposure to ionizing radiation
Ionizing radiation exposure is known to induce several
kinds of DNA damage. DNA DSBs is the main cytotoxic lesion
induced by ionizing radiation. The phosphorylated form of
histone H2AX (γH2AX) at Ser139 is generally used as a marker
of DNA DSBs (19, 20). As shown in Fig. 2B, HTori-3 cells displayed phosphorylation of histone H2AX at 5 minutes after

exposure to 5 Gy of X-ray irradiation that increased up to
1 hour. A genetically encoded highly specific fluorescent
probe has been recently developed for detecting H2O2 inside
living cells (21). This indicator, named HyPer, has been
shown to have submicromolar affinity to H2O2 and to be
insensitive to other oxidants. Using the mammalian expression vectors encoding, respectively, cytosolic- and nucleartargeted HyPer, we visualized changes in the fluorescence
of HyPer in both the cytosol and the nucleus upon irradiation
of the cells, suggesting that an increase of the H2O2 levels
occurred following radiation exposure and might be responsible for some of the effects of radiation (Fig. 2C). To confirm
the potential role of H2O2, protection of DNA from oxidative
damage was evaluated by pretreating HTori-3 cells with
catalase at different times before irradiation. Whereas the
presence of catalase in the culture medium during irradiation partially protected the cells from DNA damage, preincubation of the cells for 4 hours with catalase significantly
decreased the level of phosphorylated H2AX as shown by
Western blotting (Fig. 2D). This result confirmed by pulsefield gel electrophoresis, a sensitive assay for DNA DSBs,
showed that preincubation of HTori-3 cells for 4 hours with
catalase protected DNA from the occurrence of DSBs and
significantly decreased the occurrence of RET/PTC1 rearrangements (Table 2).
Extracellular H2O2 is able to cause RET/PTC1
rearrangements in thyroid cells
The effect of H2O2 concentrations from 1 to 25 μmol/L
on the intracellular ROS level was determined by flow cytometry analysis of DCFHDA oxidation. One hour after treatment with H2O2, we measured a concentration-dependent
increase of fluorescence, reflecting an increased level of intracellular ROS (Fig. 3A). Preincubation of HTori-3 cells with
catalase for at least 4 hours was necessary to produce a
significant decrease in intracellular level of ROS induced after
25 μmol/L of H 2 O 2 treatment (Fig. 3B). Using confocal

microscopy, after the addition of 25 μmol/L of H2O2 in the
cell culture medium, we followed the changes in fluorescence
of HyPer expressed in the nucleus. After 2 minutes, we
observed an increase in fluorescence indicating an H2O2induced signal in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Preincubation of
cells for 4 hours with catalase significantly decreased the
nuclear fluorescence.
As shown in Fig. 4A, H2O2 concentrations ≤25 μmol/L did
not induce any significant cell death after 24 hours. Time
course analysis of γH2AX in response to 12 and 25 μmol/L
of H2O2 in HTori-3 cells showed that H2AX was highly phosphorylated after 1 hour (Fig. 4B). The phosphorylation of
H2AX at Ser139, which was correlated to the H2O2 concentra-

tion, confirmed that 12 μmol/L of H2O2, corresponding to the
concentration measured after radiation exposure, was able to
cause DNA damages. As observed for 5 Gy of X-ray irradiation,
preincubation of cells with catalase for 4 hours protected
DNA from DSBs produced after exposure to 12 μmol/L of
H2O2 for 1 hour (Fig. 4C).
In the light of these findings, we treated the cells with

the highest level of DNA DSBs without affecting the cell viability and evaluated the occurrence of RET/PTC1 rearrangements in HTori-3 cells 2 weeks later by nested RT-PCR.
As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4D, 25 μmol/L of H2O2 was able
to produce RET/PTC1 chromosomal rearrangements.

Role of H2O2 in RET/PTC1 Rearrangement Formation

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that
H2O2 promotes RET/PTC1 rearrangements in thyroid cells,
and consequently, these data confirm that H2O2 might play
an important role in the initiation of PTCs. The direct link
between ionizing radiation, RET/PTC rearrangements and
PTC occurrence has been supported by the observation that
RET/PTC rearrangements are frequently found in PTC samples from patients who had been exposed during childhood
to external radiation or who lived in highly contaminated regions after the Chernobyl accident (22). In addition, several
studies have shown that in vitro irradiation of thyroid cells is
able to cause RET/PTC1 rearrangements (9, 10). In a recent

study, RET/PTC rearrangements were induced in differentiated human thyroid cells by a range of γ-radiation doses
(0.1–10 Gy), that were equivalent to those received by patients who developed a thyroid cancer (11). By using the
same experimental model, we also identified RET/PTC1 rearrangements in thyroid cells grown for 15 days after in vitro
exposure to a single X-radiation dose of 5 Gy.
Chronic oxidative stress may disrupt the genomic integrity
of cells and might induce chromosomal instability (14–16, 23).
For many years, H2O2, considered a DNA genotoxic agent, was
suspected to play a mutagenic role in the thyroid gland and
to be responsible for the thyroid nodules that were frequently
found (24). Several observations strengthen this hypothesis: in
mice, the spontaneous mutation frequency is higher in the

thyroid gland than in any other organ (25), somatic mutations of the TSH receptor are frequent in human thyroid tissue (24), and thyroid glands of mice transgenic for the
mutant a1B-adrenergic receptor (Tg-a1BAR mice) that have
increased H2O2 generation develop malignant nodules with
a high frequency (26). H2O2 causes DNA damage, such as
guanine oxidation, single-strand breaks and DSBs leading
to mutagenesis and genomic instability. DNA DSBs (27) that
can lead to chromosomal aberrations (28) result from both a
direct effect of irradiation on DNA and from the generation
of ROS by radiolysis of water (12). Although DSBs induced
by H2O2 are considered rare events, it has been shown that
H2O2 induces DSBs with a ratio of DSBs to single-strand
breaks similar to that caused by X-rays (13, 29). This induction of DSBs by H2O2 was also observed in rat thyroid
cell line (PCCl3), in human thyroid primary culture and pig
thyroid slices (13). However, in these experiments, the
H2O2 concentrations used were at least five times higher
than those used herein to generate DSBs in the human thyroid cell line HTori-3. This difference is probably due to

the models used, which have different cell membrane permeability and antioxidant capacities. HTori-3 cells seem to
be particularly sensitive to H2O2, because 50 μmol/L of H2O2
treatment affected the viability of these cells. Our results
showed that extracellular H2O2 produced through water
radiolysis significantly contributes to the appearance of
DSBs, and importantly, to RET/PTC1 generation. The extracellular concentration of H2O2 measured after 5 Gy of irradiation was estimated at 12 μmol/L and was shown to cause
DNA damage. This result was in disagreement with the recent report of very low H2O2 concentrations after irradiation
of the cell medium by similar γ-ray doses and of the absence of a potentiating effect of L-buthionine-sulphoximine
on DNA damage, a drug that decreases intracellular glutathione, and consequently, induces a protective effect for
H2O2 against degradation (13). This discrepancy could be
due to our experimental conditions, because serum was
withdrawn from the cell medium before irradiation to avoid
H2O2 produced during radiation exposure to be degraded by
the catalase activity of the serum (30).

Role of H2O2 in RET/PTC1 Rearrangement Formation

It was previously observed that extracellular H2 O2 rapidly disappeared (13, 31). We also found that 90% of the
extracellular H2O2 measured in the cell medium after irradiation had disappeared after 20 minutes. As measured by DCF
fluorescence in the cells, the intracellular production of ROS
was correlated with the concentrations of exogenous H2O2
added in the medium. Importantly, these H2O2 concentrations ranged from 1 to 25 μmol/L and were of the same order
as those measured in the medium after radiation exposure,
and were shown to produce DNA damage. Using HyPer, a
specific probe for H2O2, we detected a temporal increase in
H2O2 in the nucleus of cells treated with exogenous H2O2.
These results confirm that extracellular H2O2 diffuses into
the cells, reach the nucleus, and consequently, might cause
DNA damage. Catalase was able to protect cells from the
toxic effects of H2O2, demonstrating for the first time that
H2O2 produced during irradiation contributes to the generation of RET/PTC1 in thyroid cells. In the present study, we
observed that pretreatment of the cells with catalase for at
least 4 hours produced a significant inhibition of DNA DSBs
induced by irradiation as shown by phosphorylation of
histone H2AX. The protective effect of pretreatment with
catalase was associated with a significant decrease in intracellular and intranuclear levels of H2O2. As the oxidativesensitive fluorescence dye (DCF) is not specific for H2O2
and could also be oxidized by other radicals produced in
these conditions, the decrease observed was partial (32, 33).
Thus, as observed in other studies (34), exogenous catalase
could enter the cells by endocytosis, scavenge intracellular
H2O2, and protect the cells from oxidative damage. However,
it could also interact with the cell membranes in a timedependent manner and scavenge extracellular H2O2 before
its diffusion into the cells. These results corroborate previous
results showing a protective effect of antioxidant treatments

from ionizing radiation–induced malignant transformation
and tumorigenicity of HTori-3 cells (35, 36).
The thyroid gland, in normal conditions, produces large
amounts of H2O2 (37), that was estimated in stimulated rat
thyroid cell lines and in rat thyroid cells in primary cultures
to be ∼10 nmol/100 mg/h (38). The thyrocytes have two
H2O2-generating systems located at the apical membrane:
DUOX1 and DUOX2, which are NADPH oxidases (39, 40).
Besides being important for hormone synthesis, DUOX could
be a major source of free radicals and ROS that could cause
substantial DNA damage. Recently, we showed that NOX4,
another NADPH oxidase, is expressed in normal and cancer
thyroid tissues and might be an H2O2 generator located inside the thyroid cell (17).
In this study, we show that H2O2 is able to cause RET/PTC1
chromosomal rearrangement, the most prevalent mutation
detected in PTC. However, we cannot exclude that H2O2
could also cause other specific mutations found in the thyroid cancers as BRAF, Ras, and PAX8/PPARγ.
