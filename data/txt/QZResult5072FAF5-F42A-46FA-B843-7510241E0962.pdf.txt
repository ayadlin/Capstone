BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after decitabine failure is not
known. METHODS: Data from 87 patients with MDS (n ¼ 67) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n ¼ .20) after
failure of decitabine regimens were reviewed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 21 months from decitabine failure, 13 (15%) patients remained alive; the median survival was 4.3 months, and the estimated 12-month survival rate
was 28%. The estimated 12-month survival rates were 27%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, for patients with high-risk, intermediate-2-risk, and intermediate-1-risk disease (P ¼ .99) by the International Prognostic Scoring System. The estimated 12-month survival rates were 100%, 54%, 41%, and 18%, respectively, for patients with low-risk, intermediate-1risk, intermediate-2-risk, and high-risk disease according to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center

KEYWORDS: myelodysplastic syndrome, failure, decitabine, prognosis.

Epigenetic therapy with hypomethylating drugs is now the standard of care for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).1-4 Therapy with decitabine and 5-azacytidine have
resulted in complete response (CR) rates of 7% to 35%, median response durations of 9 to 10 months, and median survivals of 20 to 24 months.1-5 Both agents have received the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MDS and CMML.
Prognosis in patients with MDS after decitabine failure is believed to be poor, but to the best of our knowledge, there
are no literature data pertaining to their outcome. This is important in relation to patients who might benefit from specific
strategies such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or investigational agents. This report summarizes our institutional experience in patients with MDS and CMML after failure of decitabine therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from all patients with a diagnosis of MDS and CMML who received decitabine therapy from November 2003 until
June 2006 were analyzed. Patients had been treated on decitabine protocols after providing informed consent approved by
the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).3-5 Eligibility criteria included 1) age 16 years; 2) a diagnosis of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate-risk or highrisk MDS or a diagnosis of CMML; and 3) normal organ function, including creatinine 2 mg/dL and bilirubin 2 mg/
dL. Detailed eligibility criteria were previously reported.3-5 Patients were treated with decitabine at the dose of 20 mg/m2
given intravenously daily for 5 days (n ¼ 70), 10 mg/m2 given intravenously daily for 10 days (n ¼ 6), or 20 mg/m2 given
subcutaneously daily for 5 days (n ¼ 11); courses were delivered every 4 weeks. Patients who were taken off study were analyzed for the reason decitabine was discontinued, as well as their characteristics at the time they received decitabine and at
the time decitabine was discontinued. All patients (n ¼ 87) included in the study were considered to have failed decitabine
due to no response, lost response, and/or progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients who were considered to

Subsequent therapy was also coded as to whether the
patient underwent ASCT or received an investigational
agent.
Responses to decitabine and subsequent therapies
were coded according to the modified international
Working Group Criteria.6 Bone marrow aspirations and
biopsies (including cytogenetics if abnormal before therapy) were performed before every course to decide
whether to deliver the courses every 4 weeks, until CR or
for the first 3 courses (whichever was first), and then every
2 to 3 courses. Blood work was performed concomitantly
with the bone marrow aspirations. Patients were categorized for MDS risk at the initiation of decitabine therapy
and at the time of failure of decitabine according to the
IPSS7 and to the MDACC risk model.8 The latter allows
risk assessment of any patient with MDS or CMML,
regardless of prior therapy, at different time points in the
course of the disease. Adverse prognostic factors in the
MDACC risk model are as follows: poor performance,
older age, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased bone
marrow blasts, leukocytosis, chromosome 7 or complex
(3) abnormalities, and prior transfusions. The MDACC
risk model divides patients into 4 risk categories: low risk

with the median survival of 25 months and a 3-year survival rate of 34%; intermediate-2 risk (score, 7-8) with a
median survival of 14 months and a 3-year survival rate of
16%; and high risk (score, 9) with a median survival of
6 months and a 3-year survival rate of 4% (Table 1). Survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier
method. Comparison of survivals used the log-rank test.9

RESULTS
Data from a total of 87 patients with MDS and CMML
after failure of decitabine therapy, from 2003 until June
2006, were analyzed. These included 67 patients with
MDS and 20 patients with CMML. Twenty-five patients
(29%) had secondary MDS. Among 49 patients evaluable
for IPSS at the initiation of decitabine therapy, 13 (26%)
had high-risk, 23 (48%) had intermediate-2-risk, and 13
(26%) had intermediate-1-risk disease. According to the
MDACC risk model, 32 (37%) had high-risk, 31 (36%)
had intermediate-2-risk, 17 (19%) had intermediate-1risk, and 7 (8%) had low-risk disease. Cytogenetics analyses were diploid in 34 patients (39%); 39 patients (45%)
had 10% bone marrow blasts. Thirty-seven patients
(43%) had primary resistance to decitabine, and 50
(57%) developed disease recurrence. The best response to
decitabine was CR in 21 patients (24%), partial response
in 2 (2%) patients, bone marrow CR in 6 (7%) patients,
and hematologic improvement in 21 (24%) patients. The
median number of cycles of decitabine administered was
7 (range, 1-20 cycles). The characteristics of the study
group are shown in Table 2.
After a median follow-up of 21 months (range, 6 to
39 months) from decitabine failure, 13 patients (15%)
remained alive. The median survival afterdecitabine failure was 4.3 months and the estimated 12-month survival
rate was 28% (Fig. 1A); this was similar to the median survival (16 weeks) observed after idarubicin and high-dose
cytarabine (IA) failure in 36 matched-cohort patients
(patients were matched based on treatment era, blasts percentage, and chromosomal abnormalities). At the time of
treatment failure, 22 patients (25%) already had disease
evolve into AML; only 3 were alive at the time of last follow-up. Sixty-five patients (75%) had disease failure on
decitabine and still as MDS. The estimated 12-month
survival rates for patients with MDS and AML after decitabine failure were 32% and 16%, respectively (P ¼ .29).
Among 36 patients assessed by the IPSS, 15 (42%) had
high-risk, 15 (42%) had intermediate-2-risk, and 6 (8%)

resulted in a sustained CR of 14 months; and 2 patients

At the time of last follow-up, 13 patients were alive,

1 after IA). One patient remained in bone marrow CR 5
months after IA chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
The prognosis of patients with MDS and CMML after
failure of hypomethylating agent therapy has been suspected to be poor, but to the best of our knowledge, there
are no published data regarding their prognosis. This is
important for patient and physician decision-making, as
well as to establish individual patient expectations and to
assess the benefit of newer therapies.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is
the first to provide survival estimates after decitabine
failure.
As expected, prognosis after decitabine failure was
poor, with a median survival of 4.3 months. There was no
difference in outcome noted between patients whose disease transformed into AML and those in whom it did not.
The MDACC risk model predicted outcome at the
initiation of decitabine therapy8 as well as after decitabine
failure, whereas the IPSS did not predict survival after decitabine failure.7 IPSS was designed for patients with de
novo MDS and excluded patients who had previous thera-

3834

pies, secondary MDS, or CMML with a white blood cell
count >12  109/L. The MDACC risk model could thus
be used to advise patients of their prognosis and treatment
options, and to evaluate the benefit of newer therapies after the failure of hypomethylating agent therapy.
