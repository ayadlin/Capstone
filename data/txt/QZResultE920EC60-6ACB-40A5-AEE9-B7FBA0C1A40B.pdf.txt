BACKGROUND: This phase 2 trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of vorinostat in chemotherapy-pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: Patients with disease progression on 1 prior chemotherapy, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 5 ng/mL, and adequate organ
function were treated with 400 mg vorinostat orally daily. The primary endpoint was the 6-month progression rate. Secondary endpoints included safety, rate of PSA decline, objective response, overall survival,
and effects of vorinostat on serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. RESULTS: Twenty-seven eligible patients were
accrued. The median number of cycles delivered was 2 (range, 1-7). All patients were taken off therapy
before 6 months. The best objective response in the eligible patient was stable disease in 2 (7%) patients.
No PSA decline of 50% was observed. There was 1 grade 4 adverse event (AE), and 44% of patients experienced grade 3 adverse events. The most common adverse events were fatigue (81%), nausea (74%), anorexia (59%), vomiting (33%), diarrhea (33%), and weight loss (26%). Median time to progression and overall
survival were 2.8 and 11.7 months, respectively. Median IL-6 levels (pg/mL) were higher in patients removed
from the protocol for toxicity compared with progression at all time points, including baseline (5.2 vs 2.1,
P ¼.02), Day 15 Cycle 1 (9.5 vs 2.2, P ¼.01), Day 1 Cycle 2 (9.8 vs 2.2, P ¼.01), and end of study (11.0 vs 2.9,
P ¼.09). CONCLUSIONS: Vorinostat at this dose was associated with significant toxicities limiting efficacy
assessment in this patient population. The significant association between IL-6 levels and removal from the

With the establishment of docetaxel as standard firstline chemotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer,1,2 a clinical research priority in this disease is to identify second-line therapy. Histone deacetylases regulate cell
signaling and gene transcription through removal of acetyl
groups from histone and nonhistone proteins.3-5 Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity leads to accumulation
of acetylated proteins, which in turn lead to alterations in
transcription, mitosis, and protein stability, with resultant
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and survival.3-6 In
preclinical studies, histone deacetylase inhibitors have
been shown to induce tumor cell cytostasis, differentiation, and apoptosis, and to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in
various hematologic and solid malignancies. In prostate
cancer, histone deacetylase inhibition has resulted in
decreased proliferation in cell lines,7-9 and decreased tumor growth in preclinical models,9-15 suggesting that histone deacetylase inhibition is of potential therapeutic
benefit in this disease.
Vorinostat is a small molecule inhibitor of class I
and II histone deacetylases that has been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.16-18 In early testing, vorinostat showed significant antitumor activity in a broad
range of cancers,19-22 including preclinical activity in
prostate cancer.23,24 Specifically, vorinostat suppressed
the growth of the LNCaP, PC-3, and TSU-Pr1 cell
lines at micromolar concentrations.23 In mice with
transplanted CWR222 human prostate tumors, vorinostat treatment at 50 mg/kg/day resulted in significant
suppression of tumor growth. At this dose, there was
no detectable toxicity, as evaluated by change in weight
and necropsy examination.23 Kulp and colleagues have
similarly shown growth inhibition of PC-3, DU-145,
and LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lines and suppression of PC-3 xenograft tumors with vorinostat
treatment.9 These biologic, preclinical, and phase 1
data collectively provided the rationale for testing vorinostat in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer failing prior chemotherapy.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that
stimulates the progression of a variety of cancers. Multiple
studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is elevated in the
sera of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.25-27 Drachenberg and colleagues28 reported elevated serum IL-6
levels in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer
compared with normal controls, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and localized or recurrent disease, suggesting that IL-6 may be a surrogate marker of the
androgen-independent phenotype. IL-6 has also been
associated with disease progression and has been implicated as a potential marker of response to therapy.29-31
Histone deacetylase inhibition has also been shown to be
associated with decreased expression of IL-6 and other
proinflammatory mediators.32-34 These findings, along
with the observations that vorinostat can down-regulate
the IL-6 signaling cascade,35 portend a possible role for
the evaluation of IL-6 as an indicator of response to vorinostat. We hypothesized that vorinostat-mediated downregulation of IL-6 activity would be associated with a
favorable outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored trial
was conducted by the Department of Defense Prostate
Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium and the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored University of Chicago
Phase 2 Consortium. The protocol was reviewed and
approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution, and all patients provided informed
consent before initiation of any study procedures. Eligible
patients had metastatic prostate cancer with measurable
and/or bony disease that had progressed despite androgen
deprivation therapy and 1 prior chemotherapy regimen
for castration-resistant prostate cancer. All patients were
required to have prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression defined as at least 2 rises in PSA documented over
a reference value, no less than 7 days apart, with a minimum value of 5 ng/mL. Patients had to have an Eastern
Oncology Cooperative Group performance status of

100,000/lL, creatinine <2mg/dL, bilirubin within
normal limits, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
transaminase 2.5 the upper limits of normal. Patients
with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or
IV), active angina pectoris, or recent myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months) were excluded. Patients
requiring diuretics for reasons other than hypertension,
digoxin for reasons other than atrial fibrillation, or with a
history of mild to moderate congestive heart failure, or
patients with electrocardiogram results of 1) significant q
waves, 2) ST elevation or depressions of >2 mm, 3) the
absence of a regular sinus rhythm, or 4) the presence of a
bundle block were required to undergo additional cardiac
testing. Patients with known brain metastases were
excluded, but those with treated and controlled epidural
disease were eligible. Patients on luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonists were required to
continue therapy. Discontinuation of all nonsteroidal
antiandrogens (28 days for flutamide and 42 days for bicalutamide) was required. Patients taking valproic acid (a
histone deacetylase inhibitor) must have stopped therapy
at least 2 weeks before registration. No investigational or
commercial agents (other than LHRH analogues) or
therapies including other hormonal agents such as steroids, megesterol acetate (unless low dose given for hot
flashes), antiandrogens, or herbal medications were permitted to be administered with the intent to treat the
patient’s malignancy. Patients with a currently active second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers
were not eligible. Patients were not considered to have a
currently active malignancy if they had completed therapy
and were considered by their physician to show no evidence of disease.

Treatment Plan
Patients received open-label oral vorinostat 400 mg daily
continuously. All patients completed a medication diary
to monitor compliance. Toxicity was assessed using NCI
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version
3.0, and dose reductions to 300 mg/day and 100 mg/day
were specified for grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Patients were
Cancer

evaluated clinically and by laboratory tests every 21 days.
A maximum 4-week break in treatment for toxicity resolution was permitted.

Duration of Therapy, Monitoring, and
Response Assessment
Patients were monitored by history and physical exam,
toxicity assessment, and PSA every 3 weeks. Response
assessment by bone scan and computed tomography scan
and/or other appropriate imaging was performed every 12
weeks. Patients were removed from the protocol if there
was evidence of progression by PSA or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, or symptomatic
progression. Patients with progression by bone scan only
at first assessment continued treatment with reassessment
after 6 additional weeks of therapy. Patients with confirmed progression were removed from the protocol.
Patients with stable disease or better were permitted to
continue protocol therapy. Patients demonstrating progression by bone scan or other measures at the 24-week or
subsequent scheduled assessments were considered as having progressive disease, and a confirmation of progression
was not required. All patients were followed for survival.

Response and Progression Definition
Progression for the purpose of the study was defined by
any 1 or more of the following parameters: 1) PSA
progression—25% increase over baseline or nadir, whichever is lower, and an increase in the absolute value of PSA
by 5 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA at no less
than a 4-week interval; 2) measurable disease progression—progression of target lesions by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria36; 3)
nonmeasurable disease progression—worsening of bone
scan defined as development of 2 new lesions, appearance of new metastatic lesions outside of the bone,
unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions, or
development of an indication for radiation therapy or
other change in cancer therapy based on a change in a disease manifestation while on therapy.
Objective responses were defined using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.36 PSA
response was defined based on the PSA Working Group
Consensus Criteria.37 Bone disease was evaluated by bone

scan, with disease characterized as complete response if
there was disappearance of all osseous lesions as evaluated
by scans, stable or improved if there were no new lesions
and no new pain in an area where uptake was previously
observed, and progression if there was the appearance of
2 or more new skeletal lesions. An increase in the size or
intensity of lesions was not considered progression.

Endpoints and Statistical Design
The primary objective of this phase 2 trial was to evaluate
the activity of oral vorinostat in patients with metastatic
prostate cancer that had progressed on 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of
patients who did not demonstrate disease progression at
6 months. On the basis of a published retrospective analysis of second-line chemotherapy in men with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer,38 the expected progression rate by criteria used in this protocol in this patient
population at 6 months is 84% (nonprogression rate of
16%). Therefore, if the progression-free rate was 10% or
less, there would be little interest in pursuing this therapy
further, whereas with a progression-free rate of 30% or
more, further study would be proposed.
5544

Given the late time point for measuring progression,
a single-stage design was used. By using Fisher exact test,
29 patients were to be accrued. If 7 or more of these 29
patients were progression-free at 6 months, this agent
would be felt to be worthy of further evaluation. This
design provided for 80% power at the 5% significance
level.
Secondary endpoints were to evaluate the safety of
vorinostat and to determine the objective response rate in
patients with bidimensionally measurable disease, the rate
of PSA decline of 50%, and progression-free and overall
survival.

When designing this trial, we hypothesized that vorinostat-mediated down-regulation of IL-6 activity would be
associated with a favorable outcome. However, because all
eligible patients were taken off the study before 6 months,
this analysis was not possible. Given that IL-6 is associated
with the systemic immune response,39 we performed an
exploratory analysis to determine whether patients with
higher levels of serum IL-6 were more likely to be
removed from the protocol for toxicity versus progression.
Pretreatment and on-treatment peripheral blood
samples for IL-6 were collected 2 hours after the most
recent dose of vorinostat on Day 15 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of
Cycle 2, the last week of Cycle 4, and at the time of removal from the study. Quantitative levels of IL-6 were
measured using a human IL-6 immunoassay (Quantikine
HS, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. IL-6 levels were compared
between patients removed from the protocol for progression versus toxicity using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

RESULTS
Between May 2006 and February 2007, 29 patients were
registered to the protocol. Two patients were ineligible
(because of noncastration testosterone levels or previous
treatment with a radiopharmaceutical). Table 1 lists baseline patient characteristics of the 27 eligible patients.
The median age was 68 years (range, 54-80 years). Seventy percent of patients had a performance status of 1.
Previous chemotherapy treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer included docetaxel (92%),

Adverse Events
Forty-eight percent of patients experienced grade 3 or 4
toxicities. There were no grade 5 (treatment-related
deaths) adverse events. Table 2 describes in detail toxicities by type and grade, for which 70% of patients
required dose reductions. The most common adverse
events were fatigue (81%), nausea (74%), anorexia

2.8 months (range, 0.5-5.3 months), with a median overall survival of 11.7 months (2.3-14 months, with 1 patient
censored at 15.1 months). Of note, the 2 additional ineligible patients not included in the final analysis also
achieved a best objective response of stable disease.
Correlative Studies
Median IL-6 levels (pg/mL) were higher in patients

To date there is no established second-line systemic therapy for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are attractive agents, particularly in prostate cancer, because of a demonstrated effect
in vitro on proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and
angiogenesis coupled with antitumor effects in preclinical
prostate cancer models.

Recognizing that tumor regressions are difficult to
quantify objectively in patients with bone metastases, the
clinical importance of delaying progression, and the available preclinical data on the antitumor effect of vorinostat,
this trial was designed with a primary objective of assessing the effect of vorinostat on 6-month progression rates.
Although the most optimal design would have included a
control arm, the progressive nature of this disease and the
availability of published historical institutional data, at
the time of study design, on second-line chemotherapy in
a similar population indicating that the expected 6-month
progression rate is 84%38 led us to choose a single-arm
design. Although 41% of patients were taken off the study
because of toxicity, thus making it difficult to assess the
true efficacy of vorinostat at this dose and schedule, it is
reasonable to assume that, had there been clinically meaningful antitumor activity, better results would have been
expected. There was only 1 grade 4 adverse event,
and grade 3 adverse events were predominantly constitutional in nature and not significantly different from doselimiting toxicities observed in phase 1 testing.21 However,
despite dose reduction in 70% of patients in this trial,

FIGURE 2. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) values are shown

(pg/mL) were higher in patients removed from the protocol

Day 1 Cycle 2 (9.8 vs 2.2, P ¼.01), and end of study (11.0 vs
2.9, P ¼.09)

41% of patients discontinued therapy because of toxicity.
Our experience is in contrast to other reports using this
agent both as monotherapy and in combination with
other systemic therapies in other studies. In the phase 1
trials, once on a tolerable dose, patients could be treated
for prolonged periods of time21,22,40 with chronic adverse
effects of fatigue, renal insufficiency, and weight loss reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.21 Dose-limiting toxicities reported in phase 1 trials were not related to
prior therapy or type of underlying malignancy and
remained unpredictable within treatment cohorts.21 They

were also rapidly reversible, suggesting a readily reversible
metabolic process.21
Safety data from 86 patients with cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma treated with vorinostat led to Food and Drug
Administration approval of the drug, with only 9.3% of
patients removed because of toxicity and 10.5% requiring
dose reductions using the same dose/schedule as used in
this trial, also in patients who had failed prior systemic
therapies.16 Similar results were recently reported on
safety data from 476 patients who participated in the vorinostat clinical trial program, receiving vorinostat as single-agent therapy and in combination with other systemic
therapies.41
The key question is whether our observed results are
a function of the patient population studied, lack of significant antitumor activity, or both. Given the toxicity
seen in this trial, leading to dose reductions in 70% of
patients, it is possible that suboptimal cell inhibitory
plasma concentrations of vorinostat may explain why less
clinical activity was seen than expected. Without pharmacokinetics data and data from other prostate cancer settings, it is difficult to conclude whether the preclinical
models were poor predictors of clinical activity or whether
this agent would be more efficacious in an alternative
patient population or dosing schedule. One interesting
observation from this population is that patients who
came off the study because of toxicity had significantly
higher serum IL-6 levels at all time points (baseline, Day
15 Cycle 1, Day 1 Cycle, and end of study) as compared
with patients removed from the study for progression. It is
possible that, because IL-6 is associated with the inflammatory response and regulation of the systemic immune
response,39 higher levels of serum IL-6 at baseline that
were not modulated by the drug predisposed patients to
adverse side effects, leading to treatment discontinuation.
IL-6 has been associated with nonresponsiveness to drug
therapy.29-31 However, of the 11 patients taken off the
protocol because of toxicity in this study, 9 patients recovered, suggesting drug effect and not disease progression.
Toxicities were also prominent, with no significant
clinical activity, in the only other reported clinical trial of
histone deacetylase inhibition in prostate cancer.42 In this
phase 2 trial (n ¼ 31) investigating romidepsin, a
bicyclic depsipeptide that inhibits histone deacetylase, as
front-line therapy for patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer, constitutional toxicities were

common, with a 6-month disease control rate of 14% and
PSA response rate of 7%. Observations from this trial and
ours raise questions regarding the impact of an androgensuppressed state as it relates to predisposing to toxicities to
this class of drugs.
It is not clear why outcomes from clinical investigation of histone deacetylase inhibitors in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have not matched the
promising preclinical activity and scientific rationale.
However, based on the current data, further investigation
of vorinostat at this dose and schedule is not recommended. The lack of significant clinical activity in this
trial, coupled with a comparable outcome reported with
romidepsin,42 raises concerns regarding further study of
this class of drugs as single-agent therapy for treatment of
castration-resistant prostate cancer, unless newer agents
with a more favorable toxicity profile with substantial supportive preclinical data are introduced. Our observation
of the association of IL-6 levels and removal from the
study for toxicities warrants further investigation.
