ABSTRACT
LINE-1 retrotransposons encode the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, required
for their own mobility, the expression of which is inhibited in differentiated tissues
while being active in tumors. Experimental evidence indicate that the inhibition of
LINE-1-derived RT restores differentiation in cancer cells, inhibits tumor progression
and yields globally reprogrammed transcription profiles. Newly emerging data suggest
that LINE-1-encoded RT modulates the biogenesis of miRNAs, by governing the balance
between the production of regulatory double-stranded RNAs and RNA:DNA hybrid
molecules, with a direct impact on global gene expression. Abnormally high RT activity
unbalances the transcriptome in cancer cells, while RT inhibition restores ‘normal’
miRNA profiles and their regulatory networks. This RT-dependent mechanism can
target the myriad of transcripts - both coding and non-coding, sense and antisense in eukaryotic transcriptomes, with a profound impact on cell fates. LINE-1-encoded
RT emerges therefore as a key regulator of a previously unrecognized mechanism in
tumorigenesis

LINE-1, however, only a minor fraction (about 80–100)
of all copies present in the human genome are full-length
and retrotranspositionally competent [4], whereas the vast
majority of genomic LINE-1 copies are truncated at their
5’ end and thus non-mobile [5], yet still transcriptionally
competent: this implies that LINE-1 elements have a higher
potential for producing a proficient RT enzyme (encoded by
the ORF-2 present in all copies) than for retrotransposition
(of which only the full-length elements with an intact 5’
end are capable). This indicates that RT production is
not necessarily coupled with retroelement mobility, and
highlights the notion that the transcriptional capability
of the considerable high number of genomic elements
provides cells with a potentially large source of RT activity.

INTRODUCTION
LINE-1 elements are the largest family of human
retrotransposons, mobile genetic elements that move in
the human genome via an RNA intermediate. The ­LINE-1
family comprises about 500.000 copies, collectively
accounting for as much as 17% of the human genome [1].
Each LINE-1 copy encodes a bicistronic RNA transcript
which is translated into a 40 kDa RNA-binding protein
(ORF-1) and a 150 kDa protein (ORF-2), the latter
endowed with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase
(RT) activities [2]. As such, RT is the most highly repeated
protein-coding sequence in the genome of higher eukaryots
and an essential component of the retrotransposition
machinery, required not only for the mobilization of its
own coding elements, but also for other non-autonomous
retrotransposons, such as Alu and SVA [3].
At the origin of the discovery of mobile elements is
their ability to produce phenotypic variations by integrating
at mutliple genomic sites, hence interrupting the physical
continuity and functional integrity of genes, which was
historically recognized even before our understanding
of gene organization and function. In the case of

Retroviral and retroelement-derived reverse
transcriptase
The groundbreaking discovery of an RT activity
encoded by infective retroviruses [6, 7] has revolutionized
our understanding of genome function, because it
showed the existence of an unanticipated flow of genetic
information, from RNA to DNA, in contrast with the

central dogma of molecular biology - which considered
DNA to RNA as the only possible direction. Howard
Temin first predicted a functional role for RT, both in
physiological differentiation, as in embryogenesis, and in
its pathological loss, as in cancer [8]. Temin’s visionary
prediction was fulfilled, in some way, by the discovery that
non-infected cells are also endowed with an endogenous
RT that can act on the genetic information stored in nuclei
and provide a source of continuous genomic variability.
A considerable body of evidence after Temin’s discovery
has shown that the expression of endogenous RT is itself
developmentally modulated and is implicated in a broad
spectrum of pathological and physiological settings.
Indeed, non-pathological differentiated tissues contain
low levels of RT activity, if at all, while high RT activity
is typically found in embryos and embryonic tissues [9].
Besides embryonic tissues, the endogenous RT
is generally abundant in cells characterized by a low
differentiation levels and a high proliferation rate, such
as transformed cells [10], consistent with the observation
that retroelements are mobilized in many pathologies,
including tumors [11, 12]. Thus, undifferentiated or
dedifferentiated cells and tissues with a highly proliferating
potential constitute permissive systems for RT expression
and retrotransposition activity, while differentiated
quiescent cells offer less favourable contexts [13].
While the RTs of infective retroviruses, of clear
clinical relevance to infected cells, have been intensely
investigated [reviewed in 14], the endogenous RT has
received lower attention, in spite of the many clues that
overtly suggested a potential implication in fundamental
physiological and pathological processes.
Only in the last decade have roles of the LINE-1encoded RT been recognized, both in embryogenesis and
in tumorigenesis [respectively examined in 9 and 10].
The RT has emerged as a key regulator of both these
processes, in parallel with the increasingly recognized
contribution of transposable elements to genome-wide
regulatory networks [15]. Recent evidence indicates
however that retroelement mobilization reflects only part
of the roles of RT in the retrotransposition machinery.
Here we review evidence linking the endogenous LINE1-encoded RT to tumorigenesis and propose a model for
a previously unrecognized regulatory role in the genesis
and progression of cancer. To define the newly emerging
role of RT, in the next section we will briefly recall some
essential aspects of the eukaryotic transcriptome and its
links with retrotransposon networks.

has radically changed in recent years. It is now wellestablished that the vast majority of eukaryotic genomes
are pervasively transcribed [16].
The advent of next generation sequencing
technologies led to the unexpected discovery of varieties
of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [reviewed in 17, 18, 19].
ncRNAs are grouped in two major classes, small RNAs
(sncRNAs) < 200 bp, typically unstable, and long RNAs
(lncRNAs) ranging from > 200 bp to 100 kb [20] more
stable, transcribed on either or both of the DNA strands
and classified according to distinctive sequence features
[17, 19, 21). The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and
of naturally occurring small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
[reviewed in 22] provided early evidence that not only
the transcriptional landscape is of higher complexity
than ever thought, but also that these RNAs have
regulatory roles. lncRNAs are integral components of the
mammalian transcriptome [17, 19, 21, 23] and constitute
a highly heterogeneous class of thousands of polymerase
II-transcribed RNA species, polyadenylated, spliced,
mostly localized in the nucleus [reviewed in 24]. The
evidence that the vast majority of genomic transcription
is non-coding, whereas only less than 2% is transcribed
in protein-coding mRNAs [16], suggests that the former
cannot be dismissed as mere functionless transcriptional
“noise”, but may have functional roles.
Another recently identified component of the
transcriptome is composed of natural antisense non-coding
RNA transcripts (NATs) from both protein-coding and noncoding genes [25, 26]. Antisense transcripts are widespreadly
produced across the genome of various species [27, 28].
They represent a pervasive phenomenon, accounting for
about 50–70% of annotated human coding sequences
having sense partners, including genes with relevant
developmental functions [29]. They are on average 10fold less abundant than sense expression and preferentially
stored in nuclei [reviewed in 30, 31]. Interestingly, antisense
transcription occurs nonrandomly across the genome [32]
and is concentrated at preferential “hot spots” overlapping
both ends of coding genes [33, 34]. Several NATs have a
regulatory role on gene expression [35]. Together with sense
lncRNAs, NATs are components of complex genome-wide
regulatory networks that finely tune the genome expression,
with roles in tumorigenesis, differentiation and development
[reviewed in 29, 31, 36, 37].
A vast body of data implicate ncRNA classes,
both sense and antisense transcripts, in tumorigenesis
[reviewed by 38, 27], a context in which the transcriptome
is profoundly affected by altered genome methylation
[39, 40]. miRNAs were the first class of ncRNAs to be
implicated in cancer formation and spreading: miRNAs
can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors [41, 42], are
frequently located within cancer-associated genomic
regions [43] and show significantly altered expression
profiles in human cancers, a dysregulation caused by
both epigenetic and genetic changes [38], often sufficient

to induce oncogenesis [44, 45]. Long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) expression [46, 47] is highly tissue-specific
compared with coding genes, a finding consistent with
the hypothesis that lncRNAs contribute to confer target
specificity to regulatory networks [48, 49]. Serial analysis
of gene expression libraries (SAGE) indicate that the
tissue-specificity of lncRNA expression is altered in many
cancer types [50], suggesting roles in tumorigenesis.
T-UCRs are lncRNAs transcribed from ultra-conserved
regions (UCRs) [51] acting as possible developmental
enhancers in mammalian genomes [52] and aberrantly
expressed in a variety of human cancers [53, 54, 55].

Overall, the phenomena briefly outlined above entail
different levels of control (e.g., transcriptional in the case
of some inserted retrocopies, post-transcriptional in cases
in which retrotransposons originate regulatory RNAs
or, on the contrary, block their function); their common
reverse transcription-dependent origin indicates the many
ways through which RT can globally shape genome
functions. Collectively therefore these data indicate
a broad reach of TEs in shaping the transcriptome of
ncRNAs and influencing their regulatory role and tissue
specificity.

Retrotransposons and the endogenous RT in
tumorigenesis

ncRNAs and transposable elements: a long-lasting
relationship

The notion that expression of retroelements
increases in tumors, while being low in normal tissues, is
consistent with recent findings that proteins encoded by
the LINE-1 bicistronic open reading frames, i.e. ORF1p
and ORF2p, are abundant in a variety of cancers [64],
breast [65; 66], gastric [67] and pediatric germ cell
tumors [68], but not in their healthy tissue counterparts.
In agreement with these studies, using a specific
RT-targeted monoclonal antibody we have depicted
a quantitative increase of LINE-1-ORF2p proteins
in progressive breast cancer stages in a cancerprone transgenic mouse model [69]. Exemplifying
immunofluorescence panels in Fig. 1A illustrate this
increase in progressively advanced stages of breast cancer.
Cancer samples withdrawn from mice at regular intervals
after birth were staged (1 to 6 ) according to several
parameters (e.g. expression of epidermal growth factor
receptor (ERB2), down-regulation of the estrogen receptor
(ER) and others; see [69] for detailed description). We
found that both LINE-1 and SINEB1 retroelements
undergo progressive copy number amplification in
advancing cancer stages, indicating that the activation of
the retrotransposon machinery yields not only increased
expression, but also an increase in the content of
retroelements in the cancer cell genome [69].
The activation of the retrotransposition machinery
can yield extensive genomic insertions, typical of human
cancers: indeed, hundreds of novel cancer-specific
retrotranspositions have been mapped in genomes from
lung [70], colon [71, 72], prostate [71], ovarian [71]
and liver [73] carcinomas. While these data confirm
that tumors offer a highly permissive environment for
retrotransposition, they do not indicate whether these
insertions are “passenger” (irrelevant to the onset of
oncogenesis) or “driver” mutations with a causative
potential [74], favouring the emergence of a typically
altered “cancer genome” [75].
Compelling evidence indicate that retrotransposition
events exert a profound impact on genome function
and expression, with a crucial role of the endogenous

Remarkably, ncRNAs and transposable elements
(TEs) share many biogenetic, functional and structural
aspects [56, 57, reviewed in 58]:
•	 First, a high proportion of miRNAs originates from
TE families, including DNA transposons, LTRcontaining retrotransposons, LINE-1 and SINE elements [58, 59].
•	 Second, TE sequences are embedded in about threequarters of all mature long non-coding (lnc) RNA
transcripts, while being virtually absent from proteincoding exons, and account for about 30–42% of total
human lncRNA sequences [56, 57]. Interestingly, TEs
- particularly LTR-containing ERVs - target preferential positions and orientations within lncRNAs;
they are frequently associated with transcription
starting sites (TSS), and hence may have roles in
regulation of lncRNA transcription. Importantly, a
relevant regulatory role has been assigned to HERVH-containing lncRNAs expressed in embryonic stem
cells (ESCs) [56, 57] and to other lncRNAs enriched
in LTRs, the expression of which is implicated in pluripotency of ESCs [60, 61].
•	 Additionally, retrotransposition events can generate
­thousands of pseudogenes, which also have global
regulatory roles [62]. The “competing endogenous
RNA” (ceRNA) hypothesis [63] highlights the regulatory role played, among others, by pseudogenes generated via mRNA retrotransposition. In the ceRNA
hypothesis, which takes into account the variety of
targets for each miRNA and the variety of miRNAs
capable of acting on a common target, cross-talks are
generated between distinct regulatory RNAs; pseudogenes may “sequester” specific miRNAs and hence
modulate their actual availability as functional regulatory molecules. In this framework, pseudogene transcripts, mRNAs and lncRNAs constitute regulatory
networks, the “communication” of which is mediated
by a limited pool of miRNAs [62].

RT. LINE-1-encoded RT is an essential mechanistic
component for the mobility of retrotransposons,
usually not thought to play any other role beyond
retrotransposition. Intrigued by the evidence implicating
retrotransposition in the physiological state of cells
and tissues, we sought to directly assess the role of RT
in tumorigenesis using two experimental approaches.
In the first one, RT was pharmacologically inhibited in
cancer cell lines using nonnucleoside inhibitors widely
employed in AIDS treatment, e.g. nevirapine or efavirenz
(EFV) [76, 77, 78]; in the second one, we used the RNA
interference (RNAi) methodology to down-regulate the
expression of full-length RT-encoding LINE-1 elements,
the major source of RT activity in human cells [4], in
cancer cell lines [78, 79]. Both approaches yielded
consistent responses: first, RT inhibition caused a reduced
cell proliferation rate in cancer cells transformed but not
in normal cells (e.g. WI38 fibroblasts) (Fig. 1B); second,
cells assumed a differentiated phenotype (exemplifying
panels from A375 melanoma cultures are depicted in
Fig.1C). The changes in cell functional morphology (such
as seen in Fig. 1C), including the appearance of dendriticlike extensions and increased adhesion to the plate surface,
distinctive of differentiating melanoma (see [78] for an
in-depth characterization), are accompanied by global
alterations of the transcriptome of coding and non-coding
sequences, as will be seen below. Several laboratories
have independently confirmed these conclusions in studies
of various human tumorigenic cell lines treated with RT
inhibitors, both of the nonnucleoside [80, 81, 82] and the
nucleoside type [83, 84, 85].
Importantly, RNAi-mediated LINE-1 downregulation in transformed cells drastically reduced their
tumorigenic potential in nude mice cancer xenografts
(Fig.1D) [79]. Remarkably, RT inhibitors exert a very
similar, powerful anti-cancer effect in vivo; Fig. 1E
shows that EFV treatment of mice xenografted with
human melanoma cells arrested, or significantly reduced,
tumor progression [78]. The proliferation inhibitory and
differentiation-promoting effects associated with RT
inhibition, both in cell cultures and in animal models in
vivo, are reversible: on discontinuation of the treatment,
tumor cells returned to their original rate of proliferation
and dedifferentiated phenotype [78]. Thus, nonnucleoside

inhibitors reversibly prevent the activation of pathways
orchestrated by LINE-1-encoded RT in cell proliferation
and differentiation and, ultimately, in cancer growth
in vivo.
In contrast, no significant effect was associated
with down-regulation of HERV elements, which encode
a related yet distinct RT [79]. On the other hand, the
inhibition of the telomerase reverse transcriptase
(h-TERT) has an effect, yet that is clearly distinct from
that of LINE-1 RT: first, h-TERT is sensitive to specifically
targeted inhibitors but not to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors
nevirapine or efavirenz [86, 76, our unpublished results];
second, TERT inhibition results in a slow-proceeding
kinetics of cancer growth inhibition, requiring several
rounds of cell division, consistent with effects exerted
via telomere metabolism. The growth suppressive effects
associated with LINE-1 RT inhibition are instead already
appreciated within the first 48–72 hours of inhibitory
drugs. Thus, the anticancer effect of nonnucleoside
inhibitors are selectively exerted via inhibition of the
LINE-1-encoded RT.
The similarity of the tumor suppressive effects
seen in cultures either treated with RT inhibitors, or
silenced for LINE-1 expression, suggests that the
inhibition of RT activity is sufficient to recapitulate the
effects of silencing the LINE-1 active elements. We will
return to this point in a following paragraph. The data
summarized thus far suggest that both the RT protein
and the RT-encoding genes can be regarded as cancer
therapeutic targets and imply that RT inhibitors can
be effectively used in a non-cytotoxic differentiation
therapy of cancer.

LINE-1-encoded RT globally regulates genome
expression
To clarify the RT-dependent mechanism implicated
in cancer, we carried out a global expression profile
analysis of protein-coding mRNAs, miRNAs and T-UCRs,
in A-375 human melanoma cells in their native state and
after RT inhibitory treatment with EFV [87]. This revealed
that RT inhibtion yields an extensive reprogramming,
including up- or down-regulation, of the transcription
profiles of coding and non-coding RNAs (Box 1).

Consistent with these findings in melanoma cells,
a recent study independently reported that LINE-1
downregulation in breast cancer cells alters the expression
of miRNA subpopulations [88].
In our study of RT-inhibited melanoma cells,
hints to understand how the RT-dependent mechanism
might operate came from a closer inspection of the EFVdown-regulated populations of miRNAs and UCRs:
first, we noticed that a fraction was associated with overrepresented flanking Alu elements, a large proportion of
which is made up of closely spaced pairs of inverted Alu
repeats (i.e. arranged in opposite orientation). Moreover,
most RT-sensitive miRNAs and UCRs target oncogenes
or tumor suppressors located in fragile sites or cancerassociated regions. Notably, RT inhibition reversed
the expression profile of a sub-group of ten miRNAs,
classified as metastamiRs, with crucial roles in tumor
invasion and metastasis [89]: those that are up-regulated
in cancer cells were found to be down-regulated in
RT-inhibited cells and viceversa.
Crucial to interpret these data was the identification,
through buoyant density gradient centrifugation, of
particular molecules, containing LINE-1- and Alu
sequences and having the buoyant density of RNA:DNA
hybrids, present in melanoma and prostate carcinoma
cells, but not in non-transformed cells [87]. The hybrid
molecules were heterogeneous in size (from 40 nt to
roughly 1 kb) and their presence was abrogated in cancer
cells treated with RT inhibitor: this finding indicates
therefore that their genesis and maintenance is dependent
on RT function, and, furthermore, suggests functional
links connecting the RT activity, the regulation of specific
transcript classes and the transition of cells between
normal and cancer state.

direct link between high RT activity and formation of
RNA:DNA hybrids in cancer cells;
iii.	 the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids is associated with
an extensive reprogramming of the expression profiles
of various RNA classes; this suggests that the hybrid
molecules affect the normal function of such RNAs,
by either altering their regulatory roles or blocking
their translation.
Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed mechanism for the role
of LINE-1-encoded RT in tumorigenesis. LINE-derived
RT activity is up-regulated in early tumorigenesis [69],
associated with altered patterns of DNA methylation
[39, 40] and activation of LINE-1 retrotransposon
expression. The overproduced RT can “intercept” RNA
transcripts and abundantly reverse-transcribe them, with an
increased production of RNA:DNA hybrid molecules [87].
We hypothesize that this is functionally equivalent to
“sequestering” RNA templates for the formation of
regulatory dsRNAs, with an ensuing decrease in the
production of small regulatory RNAs, which ultimately
compromises the expression profile of protein-coding
genes. In this hypothetical model, the RT “subtracts”
RNA strands and renders them unavailable for dsRNA
formation, with a corresponding increase in RNA:DNA
hybrid molecules. Consistent with this view, the biogenesis
of LINE-1-derived miRNAs [90] and siRNAs [91] is
globally reduced in cancer (i.e., high RT environment,
abundant RNA:DNA hybrids) compared with normal
(low RT activity, no or negligible formation of RNA:DNA
hybrids) cells.
Small RNAs dysregulation in cancer cells is
associated with a global re-tuning of the transcriptome,
causing in turn the loss of differentiation, uncontrolled
proliferation, altered DNA and chromatin epigenetic
marks, typical of tumor cells. The down-regulation of
miRNAs in cancer cells shares striking similarities with
the suppression of miRNA functions in early embryos
[92], a naturally occurring phenomenon correlated with
three concomitant events:

A model for a novel RT-dependent tumorpromoting mechanism
What follows is a speculative attempt to integrate
the findings summarized above in a comprehensive model
that may account for the global role of LINE-1-encoded
RT in cancer and help rationalize the anti-cancer effect
of RT inhibitors. The model, building on the observed
reprogramming of retroelement-containing miRNAs after
RT inhibition [87], might extend to virtually all classes of
RNAs - coding and non-coding, sense and antisense - and
encompass the lines of evidence discussed above:

i.	 massive reduction of the overall methyl-cytosine
content in the embryonic genome [93],
ii.	 bursts of retrotransposon expression [94], and
iii.	 increased activity of embryonic RT activity [95].
Deep profiling of transcriptomes in human and
murine stem cells has recently identified a class of
retroelement-derived transcripts specifically involved
in the maintenance of pluripotency [96], confirming the
regulatory role of ncRNAs of retrotransposon origin.
The regulatory role of RT may not be solely
exerted via miRNAs; indeed, its reach includes UCRlncRNAs as well [87]. It is reasonable to believe that RTdependent regulatory networks can extend their effects to

i.	 RT activity is abundant in tumor cells and is absent, or
poorly expressed, in their healthy counterpart of same
histological origin;
ii.	 RNA:DNA hybrid molecules are detected in cancer
but not in healthy cells, and disappear in RT-inhibited,
phenotypically “cured” cancer cells: this establishes a

protein-coding mRNAs; the incorporation of the latter into
RNA:DNA hybrid structures would constitute a major
hurdle to proper translation, with direct implications over
the cell fate. In support of this hypothesis is the recent
finding that LINE-1-containing ribonucleoprotein particles
comprise not only retrotransposon RNA, as expected, but
also a variety of polymerase III- and II- transcribed RNAs,
among which many annotated mRNAs [97]; this suggests
that a large variety of RNAs might be taken up by the
RT-dependent machinery, used as reverse transcription
templates and rendered unavailable to the translation
machinery. NATs are other potential candidates for reverse
transcription: in that case, their functional inactivation in
RNA:DNA hybrids would induce alterations in expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of specific genes, by preventing either the pairing of
antisense complementary to coding sense transcripts,
or the pairing with sense sequences located in 5’-UTR
regulatory hot spots.
The pharmacological inhibition of RT in cancer
cells prevents the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids; that
coincides with the re-establishment of a non-pathological
profile of regulatory RNAs, normalization of the
transcription landscape and re-differentiation of cellular
phenotype [87]. The RT-dependent RNA:DNA molecules
present in cancer cells are as yet only partly characterized,
though LINE-1 and SINE sequences were identified by
PCR assays [87]. RT inhibitors that abolish the hybrid
molecules concomitantly alter the expression profiles

of miRNAs, lncRNAs and coding mRNAs, indicating
therefore a circumstantial link between the RNA:DNA
hybrid molecules on the one hand, and the production
of regulatory RNAs on the other hand. More sequencing
work will be required to thoroughly assess the identity of
the hybrid structures and directly ascertain the mechanism
proposed to lead from the inhibition of the LINE-1encoded RT to the reprogramming of regulatory RNA
profiles.
The highly complex mammalian transcriptome
offers in principle countless RNA transcripts as potential
substrates for reverse transcription, potentially expanding
the influence of LINE-1-encoded RT to a large repertoire
of cellular functions and processes. The effect of RT
can therefore be further modulated under various
types of stress, as stress is a well-known activator of
LINE-1 expression [98]. On the whole, the LINE-1encoded RT-dependent mechanism emerges as a global
tumor-promoting system, impacting on regulator of the
global transcriptome in the transition from normal to
transformed cell states, and hence a promising target in
cancer therapy.
A thought-provoking fact in this context is the total
refractoriness of naked-mole rats to develop cancer [99]:
strikingly, the genome of these rats has an unusually low
content in retroelements (25%, compared to 40% and 45%
of murine and human genomes, respectively) and, most
importantly, none of their transposable element is viable
[100]. It is tempting to attribute the amazing privilege of
cancer resistance to the inactive state of the RT-mediated
machinery.

or as the products of aberrant stem cell differentiation.
Experimentally, transformed phenotypes can revert back
to “normal” on exposure to differentiating conditions
[103], and tumorigenic lesions can be epigenetically
erased, at least to some extent, upon nuclear transfer
reprogramming [104, 105]. Conversion to a differentiated
phenotype can occur even in the presence (and in spite) of
DNA alterations, because epigenetic changes can bypass
the genetic alterations and reprogram gene expression,
suggesting the conclusion that, overall, epigenetics wins
over genetics [106]. The concept of phenotype reversibility
has important clinical implications for the development of
a non-cytotoxic differentiation cancer therapy [107].
The role of LINE-1-encoded RT (and anti-RT
treatment) fit well into the epigenetic landscape, to
the extent to which cancer-permissive or -repressive
conditions are induced in cells by activating or
inhibiting RT, respectively. As recalled above, RT
inhibition alone is sufficient to stop tumor progression,
reduce the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells and
restore the normal cellular phenotype, yet this acquired
differentiated state is only stable as long as the cells
are under RT inhibition. On discontinuation of the RT
inhibitory treatment, cancer cells resume their transformed
phenotype and tumor progression is resumed in animal
models. Collectively, these data point to a causative role
of the endogenous RT as a constitutive component of an
epigenetic cancer-promoting mechanism, which, when
erroneously activated in differentiated cells, “resurrects”
the un-differentiation program that was active in early
stages of embryonic life.

anti-cancer therapies, concluding that the fourty yearlasting war against cancer, if not totally lost, has certainly
not been won. In sharp contrast with current trends, he
suggested to reconsider the global strategy, stepping
back from the frontline of the battles against the multiple
diversified features of each cancer type, and to re-approach
the problem with a novel holistic view: the strategies
adopted by cancer for progression, invasion and adaptive
resistance should be attacked in an integrated approach
and targeted simultaneously, using fewer therapeutical
bullets. Ideally, the RT-targeting therapy responds to these
requirements in many aspects, because:

Retrotransposon-bearing genomes harbor a
continuously reshaping source of genetic and epigenetic
information entangled in their regulatory networks, which
generate a broad repertoire of cellular phenotypes. The
overall expression of this system is modulated during
development, is tissue-specific and organized in highly
dynamic pathways, sensitive to structural alterations,
responsive to environmental stressors and, under certain
conditions, reversible. Taking these elements into account,
it should not be surprising that cell differentiation is a
reversible phenomenon that can be reprogrammed by
introducing transcription factors, or by nuclear transfer,
into pluripotent/totipotent cells [reviewed in 101, 102].
These groundbreaking findings, while bridging the
conceptual gaps between differentiated cells and their
undifferentiated precursors, strongly support the view
that cellular phenotypes are transient conditions with
the potential to mutually convert into one another.
Cancer cells may be viewed as paradigmatic examples
of such reversible states, originating either from a dedifferentiating process occurring in differentiated cells,

CONCLUSIONS
Cancer has been viewed at various times as a
predominantly genetic [109, 110], genomic [111, 112],
epigenetic [113, 114], evolutionary [115, 116] and
differentiative [103] disease. These definitions reflect
the multiple perspectives under which cancer has been
examined and reflect its elusive nature. In practical terms,
we now view cancer as the aberrant product of genetic
mutations, the consequence of epigenetic-dependent
impairment of key processes, the sum of pathological
alterations caused by environmental stressors or the
various combinations of the above. The data discussed in
this review suggest that cancer is primarily linked to what
used to be called “junk DNA”, i.e. the retrotransposon
component of our genome, that played crucial roles in
very early stages of our development [9, 78, 79, 94, 95,
96] and is subsequently silenced and kept inactive in
differentiated tissues. Cancer can therefore be viewed as
the unscheduled resurrection of an embryonic mechanism
within an out-of-context differentiated environment
and represent the closest product to an embryo that
differentiated cells can generate. In other words, LINE-1encoded RT emerges as the tool with which cells awake
the “enemy from within”.
