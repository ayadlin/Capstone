BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence linking breast cancer and diabetes; however, few studies have explored
the association between cancer treatments and risk of diabetes. Tamoxifen may increase diabetes incidence through
its estrogen-inhibiting effects. This study assessed whether tamoxifen treatment in older breast cancer survivors is
associated with an increased risk of diabetes. METHODS: This nested case-control study used population-based
health databases in Ontario, Canada to identify women older than 65 years with early stage breast cancer between
April 1, 1996 and March 31, 2006. Cases were defined as cohort members diagnosed with diabetes during follow-up
(March 31, 2008), and each case was age-matched with up to 5 controls who did not develop diabetes. After adjusting for other risk factors, the authors compared the likelihood of diabetes between current tamoxifen users and tamoxifen nonusers, based on prescriptions at diabetes diagnosis. They also compared diabetes risk in current
aromatase inhibitor users versus nonusers. RESULTS: Of 14,360 breast cancer survivors identified, mean age 74.9
years, 1445 (10%) developed diabetes over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Current tamoxifen therapy was associated
with a significantly higher risk of diabetes compared with no tamoxifen therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.42; P ¼ .002). There was no association between aromatase inhibitor therapy and diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Current tamoxifen therapy is associated with an increased incidence of diabetes in older breast cancer survivors. These findings suggest that tamoxifen treatment may exacerbate an underlying risk of diabetes in susC 2011
ceptible women; further studies are needed to better explore this association. Cancer 2012;118:2615-22. V

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer1,2 and worse breast cancer survival,3-5 and women
with breast cancer may also have a higher risk of future diabetes.6,7 Survival after breast cancer is increasing, such that 1%
of women are now long-term breast cancer survivors.8 As survivorship continues to increase, long-term health consequences for this population are becoming more important. Well-recognized health issues for breast cancer survivors include the
risk of cancer recurrence or second primary tumors, local complications related to surgery or radiation therapy, and side
effects of adjuvant treatment.9 Despite an emerging link between diabetes and breast cancer, few studies have explored
whether treatments used for breast cancer are associated with a higher risk of diabetes.
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment in
women with breast cancer.10 Women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer are generally prescribed tamoxifen as
adjuvant therapy for a 5-year period.10 Side effects of tamoxifen include menopausal symptoms, thromboembolism, and
endometrial cancer.9 Tamoxifen may also increase the risk of diabetes through its estrogen-inhibiting effects. A role for

estrogen in glucose homeostasis is becoming increasingly
recognized.11-15 Estrogen receptors are found on insulinproducing pancreatic beta cells, and estrogen inhibition is
associated with increased insulin resistance16 and
decreased insulin secretion.17 Estrogen replacement was
also found to lower the risk of diabetes in clinical trials.18,19 Furthermore, tamoxifen has been shown to
directly suppress insulin secretion in mice.17 Finally,
tamoxifen has been shown to increase weight gain, which
may also promote diabetes.20 This effect may be of particular concern for women with breast cancer, who may
already have a higher risk of diabetes.6,7 To our knowledge, no studies have assessed whether tamoxifen may
contribute to a higher risk of diabetes in breast cancer
survivors.
The objective of this population-based study was to
assess whether older breast cancer survivors prescribed
tamoxifen therapy had a higher incidence of diabetes
compared with those who were not prescribed tamoxifen
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
This study used linked population-based health databases
from Ontario, Canada. We identified prescription records
using the Ontario Drug Benefit database, which includes
comprehensive data on publicly funded medications dispensed to Ontarians aged 65 years and older.21 Women
with breast cancer were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry, which contains data on all Ontario residents
who have been newly diagnosed with cancer or who have
died of cancer.22 The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract database was used to identify
hospital admissions, and the Ontario Health Insurance
Plan database provided information on physician service
claims. We obtained information on demographics and
deaths from the Registered Persons Database and diabetes
status from the Ontario Diabetes Database, a previously
validated registry of Ontarians with diabetes.23 These
administrative health care databases were linked anonymously using encrypted health card numbers.
Study Population and Design
We conducted a population-based case-control study
nested within a cohort of women aged 66 years and older
who were newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer as
recorded in the Ontario Cancer Registry between April 1,
1996 and March 31, 2006. We limited our cohort to

2616

women with early stage breast cancer to avoid differential
survival rates that may affect the opportunity to develop
diabetes. Because data on cancer stage were not available
from our databases, we defined early stage breast cancer as
patients who had breast cancer surgery in the 4 months
before or 12 months after the cancer diagnosis, who did
not have evidence of metastases at diagnosis, and who
were alive 1 year after the breast cancer diagnosis date.
Because we wanted to assess the association between
tamoxifen exposure and newly diagnosed diabetes, we
excluded patients who had a history of diabetes before the
breast cancer diagnosis based on the Ontario Diabetes
Database. We also excluded patients who had ductal carcinoma in situ, and those with a previous nonskin cancer
malignancy. Patients in the cohort were observed until the
first occurrence of an outcome (see below), a breast cancer
recurrence (defined as those receiving breast cancer
surgery or chemotherapy >1 year after cohort entry), a
new malignancy, death, or the end of the follow-up period
(March 31, 2008).
Cases and Controls
Within the cohort of breast cancer survivors, we identified
as cases all those who were newly diagnosed with diabetes
during the follow-up period, based on entry into the Ontario Diabetes Database. The date of diabetes diagnosis
served as the case index (event) date.
We then selected up to 5 control patients for each
case from the cohort of women with breast cancer who
were still at risk for an event at the case’s index date
(within 30 days). Eligible controls could not become a
case for at least 30 days after the index/event date of the
case. Controls were matched to cases based on age (1
year) and on fiscal year of cohort entry date (ie, date of
breast cancer diagnosis). Controls were assigned the same
index date as that of their respective case. Patients could
serve as a control more than once and were eligible to
become a case at a later time after selection as a control.
Exposure to Tamoxifen
The primary exposure of interest was tamoxifen treatment, defined as 2 consecutive prescriptions for tamoxifen
before the index/event date. Prescriptions were defined as
consecutive if the interval between 2 prescription refills
did not exceed the days supplied by the first prescription
by >20%.
We categorized exposure status into 1 of 4 mutually
exclusive groups based on the date of the most recent
tamoxifen prescription dispensed before the index date

similar indications for breast cancer treatment. Because
only women with estrogen-receptor positive (ERþ) cancers receive tamoxifen or AIs, this analysis was performed
to help separate effects related to ERþ status and/or estrogen inhibition versus tamoxifen itself. The exposure window definitions of AI exposure were similar to tamoxifen
exposure. The use of AIs was much lower than tamoxifen
use during our study period, and our databases only captured AI prescriptions that received special permission for
coverage by the insurance plan.

and its number of days supplied. Timing of use relative to
the index date was classified as current, recent past, and
remote use. Tamoxifen exposure was classified as current
use if the last prescription’s days supplied (þ14 days)
overlapped the index date. The exposure was classified as
recent past exposure if the end of the last prescription was
>14 days but 180 days before the index date. Tamoxifen use was classified as remote treatment if the last prescription ended >180 days but <5 years before the index
date. No use of tamoxifen was the referent exposure, and
it included patients who had no record of tamoxifen treatment as well as those who did not have 2 consecutive tamoxifen prescriptions or who had tamoxifen exposure >5
years before the index date.

Ethics
This study was approved by the research ethics board of
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.

Statistical Analysis
We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between newly
diagnosed diabetes and tamoxifen exposure. Because estimates were similar for the current and recent past
(stopped drug within 180 days) tamoxifen users, we combined them into 1 category in our analyses. The primary
analysis compared diabetes risk between current and
recent past tamoxifen use and no tamoxifen use. We also
compared diabetes risk between remote users and nonusers of tamoxifen. For all analyses, we adjusted for the
following potential confounders: income quintiles, Charlson comorbidity index score in the year before the cohort
entry date,24 rural residence, history of cardiovascular
event, renal failure, stroke or venous thromboembolism in
the 5 years before cohort entry, adjuvant chemotherapy,
and other prescription drugs in the 1 year before the index
date, including previous use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs;
see Tables 1 and 2).
We conducted a secondary analysis to test the influence of duration of tamoxifen therapy on risk of diabetes
among current/recent past users. This analysis was conducted to assess for a dose-response effect, and to address
the possibility of a surveillance bias, whereby there is
an increase in diabetes diagnoses shortly after starting
tamoxifen because of enhanced health care in that period.
We further classified current/recent past use into treatment for 2 years and >2 years before index date (diagnosis of diabetes). Each category was then compared with
tamoxifen nonusers.
As a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of
our findings, we repeated the above analysis to examine
for diabetes risk among patients prescribed AIs, who have

RESULTS
The study cohort consisted of 14,360 breast cancer survivors (mean age at breast cancer diagnosis date, 74.9 
6.52 years) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria
and who were followed up for an average of 5.2 years
(standard deviation, 2.9 years). During the follow-up period, we identified 1445 cases that were newly diagnosed
with diabetes. Of the 1445 cases with new diabetes,
almost all (1442) were matched to 5 controls. Of these
cases, 531 (37%) were exposed to current or recent past
tamoxifen use (ie, their most recent treatment with tamoxifen was terminated within 180 days before the index
date), and 127 (9%) had current or past AI use. The characteristics of the cases and their matched controls are
described in Tables 1 (cases and controls) and 2 (cases and
controls within tamoxifen exposure groups). Diabetes
cases were more likely to have a history of cardiovascular
disease, and were more likely to be taking oral glucocorticoids or other drugs that are known to promote diabetes
(Table 1). When baseline characteristics were compared
between tamoxifen users and nonusers, there were no significant differences in age, income, comorbidity, or cardiovascular disease. Current tamoxifen users were less likely
to have been treated with diabetes-promoting drugs, glucocorticoids, an AI, or adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 2).
Compared with no use of tamoxifen, current or
recent past use of tamoxifen was associated with a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of newly diagnosed diabetes (adjusted OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; P
¼ .002) (Table 3). Remote past use of tamoxifen (exposed
to tamoxifen >180 days before the index date) was not
associated with an increased likelihood of diabetes
(adjusted OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87-1.27; P ¼ .634). The

estimates were similar for current users with 2 years and
>2 years of tamoxifen therapy, when they were compared
with no use of tamoxifen (Table 3). Less than 1% of current/past tamoxifen users had been prescribed an AI
before starting tamoxifen, and the proportion was similar
between cases and controls.
We did not find any association between current or
past AI use and newly diagnosed diabetes (adjusted OR,
0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.07, P ¼ .143); however, the number of current and recent past AI users was small (127
cases and 688 controls; Table 3). The baseline characteristics between current/past tamoxifen and AI users were
generally similar; however, AI users tended to be younger
than tamoxifen users (mean age, 72.7 vs 74.1 years) and

2618

were twice as likely to have received adjuvant chemotherapy (11.7% vs 5.3%). Of the current/past AI users,
44.2% had been prescribed tamoxifen before AI use, and
there was no difference in prior tamoxifen use between
cases and controls. Interestingly, there was also no significant association between previous adjuvant chemotherapy
and risk of diabetes in our study (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
This population-based study found that tamoxifen therapy among older breast cancer survivors was associated
with a significantly increased likelihood of diabetes, even
after adjustment for other risk factors. The increase in

diabetes incidence related to tamoxifen therapy persisted
throughout the treatment period, arguing against a role
for enhanced diabetes testing around the time of breast
cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition, this association was only noted for current or recently discontinued
tamoxifen treatment, and an association was not seen
when previous tamoxifen users were compared with nonusers. These findings suggest that current tamoxifen therapy may promote an increased risk of diabetes in
susceptible individuals, but does not appear to have a persistent or delayed effect after discontinuation. Our study
highlights a potential new side effect of tamoxifen therapy
that warrants further investigation.
The potential mechanisms underlying our findings
are uncertain, but may be related to effects of estrogen
inhibition. There is increasing evidence that estrogen may
play a role in glucose homeostasis.11-15 The overall prevalence of diabetes is lower in premenopausal women, a
trend that is reversed after menopause.25 The decline in
estrogen after menopause is also associated with weight
gain, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome.26
Moreover, postmenopausal estrogen replacement has
been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes in clinical
trials.18,19 Treatment with tamoxifen has also been associated with hypertriglyceridemia and steatohepatitis, both
of which are features of insulin resistance and glucose
intolerance.27 In addition, a small study found a significant increase in visceral fat deposition, a prominent feature of insulin resistance, in breast cancer patients treated
with tamoxifen compared with controls.28 Preclinical

studies indicate that estrogen receptors are present on
insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells, and estrogen
appears to protect against beta-cell apoptosis.17 Estrogen
inhibition has been associated with increased insulin
resistance16 and decreased insulin secretion.17 Tamoxifen
has been shown to directly increase beta-cell apoptosis
and decrease insulin secretion in mice.17 Although this
effect may not be sufficient to cause diabetes in persons
with normal pancreatic beta-cell function, it may precipitate hyperglycemia in persons with mild abnormalities
who are already at risk for diabetes. Our findings support
the hypothesis that tamoxifen may exert direct effects on
glucose homeostasis, and highlight the need for further
studies to better explore this effect.
It is also possible that differences in hormone receptor status between tamoxifen users and nonusers may have
contributed to our findings. Tamoxifen treatment is only
used in women with ERþ cancer,10 and data on hormone
receptor status were not available in our study. Women
with ERþ breast cancer are more likely to have risk factors
that increase estrogen exposure, such as obesity, which is a
risk factor for diabetes. However, although some studies
show a weak association between obesity and ERþ
cancers, data are inconsistent.29,30 Moreover, there is evidence that women with pre-existing diabetes31 and the
metabolic syndrome,32 a strong risk factor for diabetes,
have a higher prevalence of receptor-negative breast
cancer. Our study also did not find an increased risk of diabetes in other women with ERþ cancers, such as previous
tamoxifen users or those treated with AIs. Although we

cannot exclude this explanation, these findings argue
against a prominent role of risk factors such as obesity
common to all women with ERþ cancers in our study.
Our study has implications for both patients with
breast cancer and for clinicians who care for these women.
Tamoxifen therapy may promote an increase in the development of diabetes, particularly in higher risk populations
such as older women or those with underlying risk factors.
Moreover, women with breast cancer may already have a
higher risk of diabetes because of common risk factors
such as obesity and insulin resistance.6,7 Further attention
to diabetes screening and counseling for diabetes prevention in breast cancer survivors being prescribed tamoxifen
may be warranted, especially in those with a family
history, obesity, or previous gestational diabetes. To our
knowledge, this association between tamoxifen and diabetes has not been observed in previous studies or clinical
trials. This may be because previous studies have not
formally searched for an association, especially as diabetes
is common, has many risk factors, and often presents with
few symptoms. Further research is needed to explore this
relationship in clinical trial populations and in cohorts
with more detailed metabolic data.
Strengths of our study include the use of large population-based datasets, a comprehensive cancer registry and
drug information, and a validated measure of diabetes
diagnosis. However, there are several limitations that
should be mentioned. As in all observational studies, the
possibility of bias and misclassification cannot be
excluded. In this case, we cannot rule out an effect of confounding, whereby the higher risk of diabetes associated
with tamoxifen therapy was caused by baseline differences
in tamoxifen users rather than the treatment itself. We
attempted to address this possibility by matching and
adjusting for several risk factors for diabetes such as age,
income, cardiovascular disease, comorbidity, and other
drug use that might promote diabetes. We did not have
access to clinical data such as body mass index, reproductive factors, family history, education, the presence of the
metabolic syndrome of prior gestational diabetes, breast
cancer stage, or hormone receptor status. We also
acknowledge that tamoxifen therapy is more likely to be
avoided in women who are at risk for thromboembolic or
cardiovascular disease. However, this bias would have
attenuated any difference in diabetes risk based on contraindications to tamoxifen. Reassuringly, we did not find
significant differences in baseline cardiovascular factors
between tamoxifen users and nonusers. In addition, we
cannot exclude the role of a survival bias, whereby women

Cancer

taking tamoxifen have a better cancer prognosis and are
therefore more likely to survive long enough to develop
diabetes than women not taking tamoxifen. To address
this issue, we limited our cohort to early stage breast
cancer patients and matched the cases and controls on
time since breast cancer diagnosis. The lack of association
between AI use and diabetes may have also been caused by
the small number of AI users in our study, and further
work is needed to confirm this finding. Other limitations
include the lack of information on rates of undiagnosed
diabetes and detailed metabolic measures such as glucose
levels, insulin resistance, and beta cell function.
In conclusion, this population-based study found
that current tamoxifen use was associated with a significantly increased risk of new diabetes among older breast
cancer survivors. The reasons for this association are
uncertain, and further research is needed. In the meantime, our findings suggest that closer monitoring for
diabetes in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer survivors may
be warranted.
