BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess acute and late adverse events (AEs), overall survival (OS), pelvic failure,
regional failure, distant failure, and disease-free survival in a prospective phase 2 clinical trial of bevacizumab and pelvic intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. METHODS: Patients underwent a
hysterectomy and lymph node removal, and had 1 of the following high-risk factors: grade 3 carcinoma with >50% myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 disease with any cervical stromal invasion, or known extrauterine extension confined to the pelvis. Treatment
included pelvic IMRT and concurrent cisplatin on days 1 and 29 of radiation and bevacizumab (at a dose of 5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and
29 of radiation) followed by adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was grade 3 AEs occurring
within the first 90 days (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events [version 4.0]). RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were accrued from November 2009 through December 2011, 30 of whom were
eligible and received study treatment. Seven of 30 patients (23.3%; 1-sided 95% confidence interval, 10.6%-36.0%) developed grade
3 treatment-related nonhematologic toxicities within 90 days; an additional 6 patients experienced grade 3 toxicities between 90
and 365 days after treatment. The 2-year OS rate was 96.7% and the disease-free survival rate was 79.1%. No patient developed a
within-field pelvic failure and no patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I to IIIA disease developed disease recurrence after a median follow-up of 26 months. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative bevacizumab added to chemotherapy
and pelvic IMRT appears to be well tolerated and results in high OS rates at 2 years for patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION
Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs diagnosed in the United States. Greater
than 50,000 women are diagnosed annually, with the majority presenting with early-stage disease that is curable by surgery
alone.1 Nevertheless, >8000 women die of the disease each year due to a combination of local and distant failures.1 Prior
studies have indicated that pelvic external beam radiation may reduce the risk of local disease recurrence in high-risk
patients, whereas chemotherapy may decrease the risk of distant metastasis. In the Gynecologic Oncology Group randomized trial, chemotherapy was associated with reduced distant metastases (22% vs. 18%) in patients with FIGO stage III/IV
disease,2 but not in patients with stage I/II disease.3 The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9708 phase 2 clinical trial treated women with high-risk endometrial cancer with pelvic radiation and concurrent cisplatin, followed by
additional chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel. Results demonstrated a low rate of local disease recurrence (2%),
but a high rate of distant metastases (19%).4 Given these and other findings, it was postulated that the addition of

bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic agent, may further reduce
the risk of distant metastases. With prior trials demonstrating the feasibility of using pelvic intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) in postoperative patients,5 IMRT
was chosen in the hope of reducing the incidence or severity of bowel toxicity, which might be exacerbated by treatment with bevacizumab.
The primary objective of the current trial was to
assess the rates of grade 3, nonhematologic, treatmentrelated adverse events (AEs) within 90 days from the initiation of treatment when administering concurrent bevacizumab, cisplatin, and IMRT followed by chemotherapy
with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with high-risk
endometrial cancer. The secondary objectives were to
evaluate treatment-related AEs occurring within 1 year
from the initiation of treatment; all treatment-related
AEs; disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS);
and local, regional (RF), and distant (DF) failure. The 2year efficacy rates are reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Requirements for RTOG 0921

A hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
must have been completed within 56 days before study
entry with pathologic confirmation of uterine cancer
meeting 1 of the following criteria: grade 3 carcinoma
with >50% myometrial invasion (all papillary serous and
clear cell carcinomas were considered to be grade 3); grade
2 or 3 carcinoma with any cervical stromal invasion; or
known extrauterine disease confined to the pelvis, any
grade. The following histologies were allowed: endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma,
papillary serous adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or other adenocarcinoma variant. All patients had
a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1, were 18 years
old, and were able to provide study-specific informed consent. Patients must have had adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function as indicated by the following
laboratory assessments within 21 days before study entry:
absolute neutrophil count 1500 cells/mm3 without the
use of growth factors, platelet count 100,000/mm3, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin 1.5 times
the institutional upper normal limit, hemoglobin 10 g/
dL (transfusion may have been used to meet this criterion), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 2 times the institutional upper normal limit,
international normalized ratio <1.5 for patients treated
with warfarin within 14 days before study entry, and urine
protein creatinine ratio (if the urine protein creatinine raCancer

July 1, 2015

tio was >0.5, 24-hour urine protein was obtained and
should have been <1000 mg for patient enrollment). In
patients with International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IVA disease, computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)CT of the abdomen and pelvis was required within 56
days of study entry. To assess the chest for all patients
regardless of disease stage, a chest x-ray or chest CT or
PET-CT was required within 56 days of study entry.
Treatment

No sooner than 29 days and no later than 56 days after
surgery, patients began a course of IMRT with concurrent
cisplatin (at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 of radiation) and bevacizumab (at a dose of 5 mg/kg on days 1,
15, and 29 of radiation) followed by an optional boost
with either high-dose-rate (6 gray [Gy] for 3 fractions) or
low-dose-rate (25 Gy at 0.8-1.2 Gy per hour) vaginal
brachytherapy. This was followed by 4 cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) and paclitaxel (at a dose of
135 mg/m2).
Full-bladder and empty-bladder CT scans were
required and were fused together before outlining target volumes. Contours were recommended to follow the RTOG
IMRT guideline atlas for postoperative endometrial and
cervical cancer6 and underwent central review with corrections recommended before treatment was initiated.
The vaginal planning target volume (PTV) (integrated target volume with a 7-mm margin) and lymph
node PTV (lymph node clinical target volume with a 7mm margin) were prescribed 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The
dose was prescribed to cover 97% of the vaginal PTV and
lymph node PTV. Bone-marrow sparing with IMRT was
not required and no bone dose-volume constraints were
implemented as part of this protocol. Patients with pelvic
lymph node(s) measuring 2 cm in any dimension on the
diagnostic or planning CT or proven by biopsy to be positive were candidates to receive, at the discretion of the
treating radiation oncologist, 8 additional fractions to the
enlarged lymph node(s) in 1.8-Gy daily fractions for a
total dose of 59.4 Gy to the lymph node boost PTV.
Patients were followed for disease status with history and
physical examination every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
months for another 2 years, and annually thereafter.

trial was that the addition of bevacizumab to the combination of IMRT and cisplatin would not increase this rate
beyond 60%. The current study was designed with a 1sided, upper-bound confidence interval (CI) to estimate
this AE rate. A total of 27 evaluable patients were required
to have 95% confidence that the true grade 3, nonhematologic, treatment-related AE rate is 60%. To allow for
ineligible/non-protocol-treated patients, a total sample
size of 34 patients was required for this study. AEs were
scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version
4.0; MedDRA version 12.0).
Secondary endpoints

For overall survival (OS), failure was defined as death due
to any cause and survival time was measured from the date
of study entry to death or to the date of last follow-up for
patients who were alive. Data regarding surviving patients
were censored at the date of last contact. Pelvic failure
(PF) was defined as disease recurrence in the pelvis,
including the pelvic or sacral lymph nodes, and required
confirmation by histologic or cytologic biopsy of the
recurrent lesion. RF was defined as disease recurrence in
the paraaortic lymph node region. DF was defined as the
appearance of distant metastasis. Death was considered a
2158

competing risk for PF, RF, and DF and each was measured from the date of study entry to the date of first failure
or last follow-up for patients who did not have a recurrence. For DFS, failure was defined as PF, DF, or death
due to any cause and was measured from the date of study
entry to the date of first failure or last follow-up for
patients who did not have a recurrence. OS and DFS rates
were estimated univariately with the Kaplan-Meier
method7 and PF, RF, and DF rates were estimated using
the cumulative incidence method.8
RESULTS
A total of 34 patients were accrued from November 6,
2009 to December 12, 2011. Four patients were excluded
from analysis: 1 did not receive protocol treatment and 3
were ineligible (1 had undergone a PET/CT scan >56
days before study registration, 1 had positive peritoneal cytology, and 1 had urinary protein creatinine >1 mg/dL).
Detailed baseline patient characteristics of the 30 patients
included in the analysis are listed in Table 1. A total of 29
of 30 patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and 19 had paraaortic lymph node removal.
Protocol Treatment Compliance

Approximately 93% of patients were treated as per protocol with concurrent chemotherapy and 90% received their
adjuvant chemotherapy as per protocol. All patients
received bevacizumab in full and on time.
RT compliance was assessed in terms of whether
physician contours of the tumor volume and organs at
risk, which underwent rapid review within 24 hours, followed the protocol-recommended contouring guidelines.
For tumor volume contouring, 23 patients were as per
protocol and 7 (23%) had an acceptable variation.
For contouring of organs at risk, 27 patients were
considered as per protocol whereas 3 patients (10%) had
acceptable variations. Bladder, sigmoid, femur, and tumor
volume were all contoured as per protocol on final submission (after rapid review for institutional first case). Barium
contrast given by mouth to opacify the small bowel was
allowed at the physician’s discretion. Two patients (6.7%)
had unacceptable deviations on small-bowel contouring, in
which the bowel loops were contoured instead of the bowel
space; in the other 28 cases, the small bowel was contoured
as per protocol. One patient had an acceptable variation on
rectum contouring, with the inferior portion of the rectal
contour overlapping the vaginal integrated target volume;
the other 29 rectal contours were as per protocol.
Compliance was also assessed with regard to treatment planning, with assessments of whether the lymph

limits. With regard to treatment planning, 5 cases had
“deviation unacceptable” (>0.03 cc of PTV receiving
<91% of prescription) and 12 patients had “variation
acceptable” (>0.03 cc of PTV receiving 91%-93% of prescription) scores for the tumor dose-volume analysis, due
to the minimum dose requirements. For normal tissues,
only 1 “deviation unacceptable” score was recorded for
small bowel and no “deviation unacceptable” cases were
noted for bladder, rectum, or femoral heads, although 12
patients had acceptable variations for the dose-volume
analysis recorded (Table 2).
Primary Endpoint
Acute adverse events

Of the 30 patients, 7 (23.3%; 1-sided 95% CI, 10.6%36.0%) developed grade 3, treatment-related, nonhematologic AEs 90 days from the initiation of concurrent
treatment (ie, acute AEs). Table 3 lists the grade 3 and 4
side effects, including hematologic toxicity, in detail.
Because the 1-sided, upper-bound CI for the rate of grade
3, treatment-related, nonhematologic AEs occurring
90 days from the initiation of concurrent treatment is
36%, there is 95% confidence that the true grade 3,
nonhematologic, treatment-related AE rate is <60%.
One acute toxicity, a thromboembolic event, was considered possibly attributable to bevacizumab.

listed in Table 4. Nine patients reported late AEs, 3 of
whom also had acute toxicities.
AEs occurring during concurrent treatment, during
adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, and after the end of all
treatments are shown in Table 5. One late toxicity,
epistaxis, was considered possibly attributable to

Survival outcomes

The median follow-up for all patients was 25.9 months
(range, 13.6-43.4 months). The 2-year estimate of OS
was 96.7% (95% CI, 78.6%-99.5%) with a total of 4
deaths, all of which were from endometrial cancer. None
of the 30 patients enrolled developed a within-field pelvic-only failure. The cumulative incidences for RF and
DF at 2 years were 7.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-17.1%) and
17% (95% CI, 3.2%-30.9%), respectively. The 2-year
estimate of DFS was 79.1% (95% CI, 59.2%-90.1%). A
total of 6 patients developed recurrent disease. Two of the
6 had paraaortic lymph node failures; 1 of these patients
also developed distant lymph node metastases and both
patients subsequently died. One of the 2 patients with
paraaortic lymph node failure had undergone a paraaortic
lymph node dissection at the time of diagnosis; both had
undergone pelvic lymph node lymphadenectomy at the
time of diagnosis. Two of the other 4 patients died of distant disease. The remaining 2 patients were alive with DF
at the time of last follow-up; 1 patient continued to
receive chemotherapy and the other developed a 1-cm recurrence in the peritoneum above the pelvic field at a laparoscopic port site, which was resected laparoscopically
with negative surgical margins. This individual continued
to receive therapy with megestrol acetate and had been

DISCUSSION
This phase 2 prospective trial demonstrates the feasibility
of administering bevacizumab with pelvic IMRT followed
by combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and
paclitaxel in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.
The rate of acute grade 3, nonhematologic, treatmentrelated toxicity was 23.3% and the hypothesis that the
true rate of such AEs is <60% was confirmed. This treatment regimen was found to be feasible, with only a few
bevacizumab-related toxicities reported. A total of 93% of
patients were treated as per protocol with concurrent
chemotherapy and 90% received their adjuvant chemotherapy as per protocol. All patients received bevacizumab
in full and on time. Compared with the RTOG 9708
trial, changes in the current trial included adding bevacizumab to concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation,
switching from the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel
to that of carboplatin and paclitaxel after concurrent chemoradiation, and using IMRT instead of 3-dimensional
conformal radiation.
In this RTOG 0921 trial of concurrent bevacizumab, cisplatin, and radiation, 1 case of an acute toxicity (a
thromboembolic event) and 1 case of a late toxicity (epistaxis) were considered to be possibly attributable to bevacizumab. Therefore, the results of the current study are
unique in the finding that bevacizumab may be administered during radiation to the postoperative pelvis without
increasing the rate of pelvic complications. There were no
side effects attributable to the use of carboplatin instead of
cisplatin in conjunction with paclitaxel. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in comparison with radiation in
patients with high-intermediate or advanced stage endometrial cancer has been reported in 3 randomized trials to
Cancer

date, none of which to our knowledge used the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel.2,9,10
Other studies have shown an effect of bevacizumab
in patients with endometrial cancer. One study treated
patients with recurrent disease definitively to a local field
with concurrent radiation and bevacizumab at a dose of
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses; no other chemotherapy was administered.11 Results demonstrated that 2 of
19 patients experienced thromboembolic events, 2
patients had grade 1 and 3 patients had grade 2 proteinuria, 2 patients had grade 1 and 2 patients had grade 2
hypertension, and 1 patient had a grade 1 nosebleed. Dramatic shrinkage of the tumor was noted for patients with
recurrent endometrial cancer, with a 3-year OS rate of
80%. Another study analyzed data from patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer who were treated
with bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks
until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity without
other chemotherapy.12 The authors reported an overall
response rate of 13.5%, a median progression-free survival
of 4 months, and a median OS of 10 months. In comparison, in the current study, patients were treated immediately postoperatively rather than at the time of disease
recurrence, and they received a dose of 5 mg/kg to minimize side effects related to bevacizumab.
Chemotherapy has been variously compared with
radiation and combined with it. In trials comparing the 2
modalities, the chemotherapy-alone arms have been
reported to demonstrate local disease recurrence rates of
18% for women with stage III to IV disease2 and 11%9 or
7%10 for those with stage IC to IIIC disease. Chemotherapy is believed to confer a survival advantage when combined with radiation.13 For patients with highintermediate and advanced disease, a combination of
chemotherapy and radiation offers potential reductions in
both local and distant disease recurrence. The Gynecologic Oncology Group 0184 trial randomized patients

treated with surgery and pelvic and/or paraaortic radiation
to cisplatin and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel;
10% developed a locoregional recurrence and 30% experienced distant disease recurrence.14 RTOG 9708, a phase
2 trial of concurrent cisplatin with radiation and 4 cycles
of cisplatin (at a dose of 50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (at a
dose of 175 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) after radiation, demonstrated a 4-year pelvic recurrence rate of 2%, a regional recurrence rate of 2%, and a distant recurrence rate of
19%.4 No recurrences occurred in the 13 patients with
stage IC, stage IIA, or stage IIB disease.15 In terms of clinical outcomes, at 2 years, the RTOG 9708 trial had a 2year OS rate of 91% compared with the current study at
97%; however, continued follow-up is required for more
complete conclusions. These studies indicate the efficacy
of combined chemoradiation at improving local control,
but demonstrate the need for novel agents to reduce the
rate of distant disease recurrence. The current trial was
administered to patients with a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1; it is not clear whether patients with worse
performance status would tolerate the addition of bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
IMRT treats regions at risk of disease spread while
sparing adjacent normal tissues. IMRT may reduce the
dose to normal tissues, thereby potentially decreasing
acute and chronic toxicity.16,17 Retrospective studies of
pelvic IMRT indicate that the volume of small bowel
treated to >45 Gy is smaller with IMRT than with wholepelvic radiation. Portelance et al reported a >60% reduction in the volume of small bowel irradiated to >45 Gy
with IMRT.18 A study by Roeske et al demonstrated a
50% reduction in the volume of small bowel irradiated to
>45 Gy.19
Overall, the rate of grade 3 toxicity reported during concurrent treatment in the RTOG 9708 trial (3dimensional conformal pelvic radiation and concurrent
cisplatin chemotherapy followed by adjuvant cisplatin
and paclitaxel) was 30%. To determine whether IMRT
may be of benefit in reducing this rate, toxicities occurring during RT in the current study (RTOG 0921) were
compared with those of the precursor trial RTOG 9708.
In RTOG 9708, during the concurrent portion of the
treatment, 43% of participants had grade 2, 27% had
grade 3, and 2% had grade 4 acute toxicity; in the current
RTOG 0921 trial, these rates were 30%, 23%, and 7%,
respectively. It is interesting to note that although the systems are similar, toxicity in RTOG 9708 was assessed
according to the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity
Criteria (1989), the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring
Criteria, and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring
2162

Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organisation
for Research and Treatment of Cancer, whereas the current trial used the subsequent the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 4.0), which developed from the preceding scales.
Prospective results from the ongoing RTOG 1203
TIME-C randomized trial may help to clarify whether
IMRT reduces toxicity compared with 3-dimensional
conformal radiation.
Compared with the RTOG 0418 trial, which was a
prospective series of patients treated with postoperative
pelvic IMRT, the less strict dose-volume histogram
(DVH) criteria used in the current trial resulted in higher
compliance for constraints. In the RTOG 0418 trial, dose
criteria were not met in 67% of cases for the bladder, in
76% of cases for the rectum, and in 17% of cases for the
bowel. In comparison, in the current trial, dose criteria
were not met in 14% of cases (4 of 29 cases) for the bladder, in 24% of cases (7 of 29 cases) for the rectum, and in
14% of cases (4 of 28 cases) for the bowel. To illustrate
the effect of stringency, the femoral head constraint in the
RTOG 0921 trial was met in all cases (all had a DVH
value of 15% receiving <35 Gy); in contrast, the RTOG
0418 constraint was not met in 33% of cases (<15% of
the femoral heads receiving 30 Gy). No increase in toxicity was noted with the less stringent constraints. The
high number of variations in PTV calculations indicates
the need for the relaxation of these constraints in future
trials.
Treating patients with endometrial cancer with
concurrent bevacizumab, cisplatin, and pelvic radiation
followed by combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel is feasible, has low rates of
bevacizumab-specific toxicities, and has a high survival
rate at 2 years. Future randomized trials should further
address the use of bevacizumab in patients with endometrial cancer.
