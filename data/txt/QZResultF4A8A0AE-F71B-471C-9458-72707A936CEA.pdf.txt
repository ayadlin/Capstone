FOXO3a Is a Major Target of Inactivation by PI3K/AKT
Signaling in Aggressive Neuroblastoma

Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system with a highly variable
prognosis. Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma is correlated with
poor patient prognosis, but the precise downstream effectors mediating this effect have not been determined. Here
we identify the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a as a key target of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma.
FOXO3a expression was elevated in low-stage neuroblastoma tumors and normal embryonal neuroblasts, but
reduced in late-stage neuroblastoma. Inactivation of FOXO3a by AKT was essential for neuroblastoma cell
survival. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 activated FOXO3a and
triggered apoptosis. This effect was rescued by FOXO3a silencing. Conversely, apoptosis induced by PI-103 or the
AKT inhibitor MK-2206 was potentiated by FOXO3a overexpression. Furthermore, levels of total or phosphorylated FOXO3a correlated closely with apoptotic sensitivity to MK-2206. In clinical specimens, there was an inverse
relationship between gene expression signatures regulated by PI3K signaling and FOXO3a transcriptional activity.
Moreover, high PI3K activity and low FOXO3a activity were each associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Our
work indicates that expression of FOXO3a and its targets offer useful prognostic markers as well as biomarkers for
PI3K/AKT inhibitor efﬁcacy in neuroblastoma. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2189–98. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor derived from the peripheral sympathetic neural lineage with a highly variable prognosis. Low-stage tumors have an excellent prognosis, but highstage tumors often are refractory to treatment. The genetic
basis underlying the development of this tumor is poorly
understood; the most common single gene events being MYCN
ampliﬁcation (20% of cases) and ALK mutation (8% of
cases), but whole genome sequencing efforts recently identiﬁed many more mutated genes (1). Activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway has been implicated in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.
Immunohistochemical analysis of neuroblastoma revealed an
association between high-stage tumors and activation of AKT;
in addition, PI3K/AKT pathway activation could confer chemotherapeutic resistance to neuroblastoma cell lines (2, 3).
AKT activity via GSK3b inhibition has also been directly
implicated in the posttranslational stability of MYCN, which
is supportive of cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in
vivo (4, 5). Other than MYCN stabilization, few mechanisms

downstream of PI3K/AKT that are essential for the proliferation and survival of neuroblastoma cells have been identiﬁed.
The forkhead-box type O (FOXO) subfamily of forkhead
domain-containing transcription factors are important downstream effectors of the PI3K/AKT pathway (6). This family
consists of 4 members in humans, FOXO1, 3, 4, and 6. FOXO1/3/
4 have been identiﬁed as bona ﬁde tumor suppressors when
simultaneously knocked out in mice (7). Recently, FOXO3a
knockout has been found to expand the tumor spectrum of p53
knockout mice (8). Human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma have
frequent translocations of FOXO1 to PAX3 or PAX7, whereas
FOXO3a and FOXO4 are commonly fused to MLL in mixed
lineage leukemia, creating oncogenes in both cases (9–12).
Recently, heterozygous FOXO3a deletions were described in
natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms (13). Functional studies
suggest a tumor suppressive role for FOXOs, as FOXO proteins
were found to be inactivated by constitutively active PI3K/AKT
or RAS/MAPK/ERK signaling (6, 14, 15). Activation of these
pathways can directly result in phosphorylation of FOXOs and
their subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration and/or degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. In neuroblastoma,
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO has previously been
correlated with neuroblastoma cell survival in response to
growth factor stimulation (16, 17). When FOXO is activated by
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, FOXOs can promote a
wide range of effects including cell-cycle arrest, cell differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis via various mechanisms (18,
19). However, the case for FOXOs as tumor suppressors has
become more complicated because of their alternative roles as
stress response factors (20). In breast cancer, prolonged
FOXO3a activity can cause resistance to the chemotherapeutic

doxorubicin (21). Similar effects were also found in chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells (22). All of these ﬁndings emphasize that the context within which FOXOs are activated is
crucial to the cellular response attained.
Here, we use an experimental and computational approach
that identiﬁed FOXO3a as a key downstream player in the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in neuroblastoma. FOXO3a has
an exceptionally high expression in normal embryonal neuroblasts and in neuroblastoma tumors. However, in aggressive
neuroblastoma, FOXO3a expression is signiﬁcantly reduced,
suggesting a tumor suppressor role. On the protein level,
FOXO3a is phosphorylated and inhibited by AKT signaling in
neuroblastoma cell lines. We show that reactivation of FOXO3a
after AKT inhibition triggers apoptosis, which is further
increased by combined FOXO3a overexpression and AKT
inhibition. From microarray proﬁling of FOXO3a manipulation, we identiﬁed a gene expression signature for FOXO3a
activation, which predicts good prognosis in neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and compounds
All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 mmol/L Lglutamine, 10 U/mL penicillin, and 10 mg/mL streptomycin and
maintained at 37 C under 5% CO2. Cell line identities were
conﬁrmed by short tandem repeat proﬁling using the PowerPlex16 system and GeneMapper software (Promega). During
the month of November 2012, the short tandem repeat proﬁles
were validated by comparison with those from 3 public databases storing the cell lines (Leibniz-Institut DSMZ, American
Type Culture Collection, and the Children's Oncology Group
Cell Culture and Xenograft Repository). PI-103 was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience and MK-2206 from Selleckchem. Doxycycline, isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and
puromycin were from Sigma. Blasticidin was from Invitrogen.
FACS analysis
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and each condition was
carried out in triplicate. After harvesting and washing cells in
PBS þ 4 mmol/L EDTA, the cells were ﬁxed in 70% ice-cold
ethanol. The cells were then collected and incubated in a
hypotonic solution of PBS, dH2O, propidium iodide (PI), and
RNAse. A total of 20,000 nuclei per sample were counted and
the cell-cycle distribution determined.
Microarray data
The 12 microarray proﬁles of PI-103 treatment and FOXO3a
overexpression can be found at the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database under accession GSE42762.

Results
FOXO3a expression is high in normal neuroblasts and
low-stage neuroblastoma and reduced in high-stage
tumors
As PI3K/AKT signaling is associated with a poor prognosis in
neuroblastoma, we investigated downstream targets of this

pleiotropic pathway for a role in this tumor. FOXO transcription factors are inactivated by AKT signaling. We therefore
investigated expression of FOXO family genes (FOXO1, 3, 4, and
6) in a large collection of microarray data, including our series
of 88 neuroblastoma of all stages (NB88) with the R2 MegaSampler application in the bioinformatic program R2 (http://
r2.amc.nl). Most strikingly, FOXO3a mRNA expression was
found to be very high in neuroblastoma relative to all other
tumor types and to normal tissues and this was not the case for
FOXO1, 4, and 6 (Fig. 1A; data not shown). We also analyzed
FOXO3a expression in a panel of 24 neuroblastoma cell lines
and a series of cell lines from other tumors. FOXO3a expression
was highest in the neuroblastoma cell lines, conﬁrming the
neuroblastoma-speciﬁc expression pattern of FOXO3a (Fig.
1B). We then analyzed whether FOXO3a is also highly
expressed in the normal tissue from which neuroblastoma
can arise. We therefore checked a dataset with 3 microdissected samples of normal human fetal adrenal neuroblasts that
were proﬁled with neuroblastoma tumors of different stages
(23). FOXO3a expression levels were nearly 2 times higher in
normal human fetal adrenal neuroblasts and stage I tumors
than in high-stage neuroblastoma tumors (Fig. 1C). The high
expression in normal neuroblasts and relatively reduced
expression in high-stage tumors indicates that FOXO3a is
lineage-speciﬁc expressed in neuroblasts of the sympathetic
nervous system and downregulated in high-stage tumors. We
therefore inquired whether FOXO3a expression carries a prognostic value among stage III and IV tumors. Indeed, Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis of the 53 stage III and IV tumors in our
NB88 series showed that low FOXO3a expression was significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P ¼ 6.8e-03; Fig. 1D).
PI3K/AKT signaling regulates FOXO3a phosphorylation,
nuclear localization, and transcriptional activation in
neuroblastoma
We ﬁrst asked whether the extremely high FOXO3a expression in neuroblastoma was functionally related to the PI3K/
AKT signaling route. We investigated regulation of FOXO3a by
AKT in 2 neuroblastoma cell lines, one with and one without
MYCN ampliﬁcation [SKNBE(2c) and SY5Y, respectively]. Both
cell lines were treated with the potent dual-speciﬁcity inhibitor
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR kinases PI-103
(24). PI-103 induced G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in both
lines within 24 hours as shown by PI staining and ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 2A). Western blot
analysis showed robust steady state phosphorylation of AKT
and FOXO3a in both cell lines and complete dephosphorylation of these proteins within 2 hours following PI-103 treatment (Fig. 2B). This dephosphorylation coincided with a
depletion of the cytoplasmic FOXO3a pool and its accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 2C). To investigate whether FOXO3a
was transcriptionally active following PI-103 treatment, we
cloned synthetic FOXO reporters (FireFOX reporters) containing either 6 copies of a wild-type FOXO DNA-binding element
(DBR; TTGTTTAC) or a mutated element (TCGTGTAC). Using
these vectors, we observed a 2- to 3-fold increase in endogenous FOXO transcriptional activity at 24 hours post-PI-103
treatment in SY5Y and SKNBE(2c) (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the

apoptosis induced by PI-103 treatment in these 2 cell lines
coincided with FOXO3a re-activation.
Inducible silencing of endogenous FOXO3a expression
rescues SKNBE(2c) cells from PI-103–induced apoptosis
We next asked whether the apoptosis induced by PI103 was
mediated by the reactivation of FOXO3a. We constructed a
stable SKNBE(2c) line containing an IPTG-inducible FOXO3aspeciﬁc short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Addition of 0.5 mmol/L
IPTG to this line induces efﬁcient FOXO3a knockdown within
48 hours and no change in AKT activity as indicated by
phosphorylation of the AKT substrate PRAS40 (ref. 25; Fig.
3A). After 48 hours of IPTG treatment, 2.5 and 5 mmol/L PI-103
was added to the cells for an additional 24 hours. The IPTGinduced silencing of FOXO3a by shRNA rescued the cells from
PI-103–induced apoptosis, as evident from a reduction of the
sub-G1 fraction by 76% to 82% (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig.
S1A). In addition, the IPTG-treated cells showed an increase in
G1 arrest after PI-103 treatment of 6.2% to 6.9% of the total

population when compared with the IPTG PI-103–treated
cells. This suggests that the FOXO3a knockdown cells arrested
in G1 instead of dying after PI3K/AKT inhibition; indicating
that FOXO3a primarily drives apoptosis at the expense of G1
arrest. These data show that FOXO3a is a key mediator of
apoptosis following PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition.
Inducible overexpression of FOXO3a increases PI-103–
induced apoptosis in SY5Y
To further corroborate that FOXO3a activity drives apoptosis
in neuroblastoma cells, we also tested whether increased
FOXO3a expression enhances apoptosis. To probe this, we
constructed a polyclonal SY5Y cell line containing an inducible
hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged FOXO3a expression construct.
Doxycycline addition induced FOXO3a overexpression, which
became maximal between 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 4A). Western
blot analysis showed a strong increase of total FOXO3a protein
after 24 hours of doxycycline treatment, reﬂecting the contribution of the transgene to the endogenous pool (Fig. 4B,

compare lanes 1 and 3). A subsequent 6-hour treatment with 1
mmol/L PI-103 blocked phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO3a in
these cells, regardless of doxycycline treatment. PI staining and
FACS analysis of this experiment revealed an increase in the
sub-G1 from 15.8% in the dox condition to 34.3% in the þdox,
indicating strongly increased apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Notably, a
strong decrease in G1 arrest was observed in the þdox/þPI-103
condition, again showing FOXO3a drives apoptosis and not cellcycle arrest in neuroblastoma. To quantify the overall decrease
in viability, MTT assays were conducted at 24- and 48-hour time
points. Increasing amounts of PI-103 or the highly speciﬁc panAkt inhibitor MK-2206 (Akti) were used in conjunction with
FOXO3a overexpression by doxycycline addition (26, 27). Induction of FOXO3a expression resulted in a consistent decrease in
cell viability relative to the dox condition with all IC50
differences highly signiﬁcant (P < 0.01; Fig. 4D). We conclude
that high FOXO3a expression strongly potentiates the apoptosis induced in neuroblastoma cells by PI3K/AKT inhibitors.

Induction of apoptosis by AKT inhibition positively
correlates with total and phosphorylated FOXO3a
protein levels across cell lines
As FOXO3a expression was identiﬁed as a major determinant of neuroblastoma apoptosis in response to PI3K/AKT
inhibition, we evaluated this relationship across a neuroblastoma cell line panel. From our Affymetrix array data, we chose a
panel of 11 cell lines that exhibited a range of FOXO3a mRNA
expression levels and we tested their response to a 48-hour
MK-2206 (Akti) treatment. Because PI-103 is a dual inhibitor of
PI3Ks and mTOR, we used MK-2206 (Akti) to more speciﬁcally
probe the contribution of the AKT/FOXO3a axis and eliminate
the inﬂuence of direct PI3K/mTOR inhibition. The 8-mmol/L
MK-2206 treatments resulted in effective pathway inhibition in
all cell lines as shown by Western blot analysis for phosphorylated FOXO3a and PRAS40 as well as AKT serine 473 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Apoptosis was quantiﬁed by cell-cycle
FACS analysis and was found to correlate with total FOXO3a

levels as quantiﬁed by Western blot analysis (Spearman correlation coefﬁcient of r ¼ 0.655; P ¼ 0.034) and with phosphoFOXO3a protein levels (r ¼ 0.818; P ¼ 0.004). Strikingly, AKT
activity as quantiﬁed by either phospho-Ser473 AKT or normalization of phospho-Thr246 PRAS40 to total PRAS40 did not
signiﬁcantly correlate with apoptosis by the same test (r ¼
0.545; P ¼ 0.087 and r ¼ 0.518; P ¼ 0.107, respectively). All
correlations are graphed in Supplementary Fig. S2A. Taken
together with the other functional experiments, this result
suggests that FOXO3a is a pivotal factor that determines the
apoptotic response upon PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition in
neuroblastoma.
PI3K and FOXO3a gene expression signatures are highly
prognostic in neuroblastoma
The cell line experiments showed that FOXO3a is a major
mediator of the apoptotic response of neuroblastoma cells
upon PI3K/AKT inhibition. This ﬁnding led us to analyze
whether PI3K/AKT signaling and FOXO3a transcriptional
activity are identiﬁable in neuroblastoma tumors. We therefore used the mRNA proﬁles of the NB88 neuroblastoma series
and analyzed which samples showed PI3K/AKT activity and
FOXO3a transcriptional activation. To that end, we generated
signatures of the downstream genes regulated by PI3K/AKT or

FOXO3a activity in SY5Y cells. For consistency with subsequent
experiments (see later), we used the SY5Y-TetR-FOXO3a cells
without inducing the FOXO3a transgene. We ﬁrst identiﬁed the
genes regulated by PI3K/AKT signaling in this line by treating
the cells with 1 mmol/L PI-103 or vehicle for 6 hours and
proﬁling mRNA expression on Affymetrix U133 plus2.0 arrays.
This experiment was carried out in triplicate across different
days. The array data identiﬁed 464 signiﬁcantly regulated genes
(P  0.01), which represented a signature for the PI3K/AKT
pathway (Supplementary Table S1A).
To probe the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the series
of 88 neuroblastoma tumors, we conducted a 2-group k-means
clustering of the 464 genes. This cluster analysis yielded a clear
separation in the NB88 dataset into 2 groups, one with 49
tumors and the other with 39 tumors (Fig. 6A). Kaplan–Meier
survival analysis of these 2 groups revealed that PI3K/AKT–
regulated genes have a very strong prognostic signiﬁcance in
neuroblastoma. High levels of PI3K/AKT signaling are correlated with poor outcome (Fig. 6B; P ¼ 1.3e-13). Further support
for this interpretation was uncovered by checking the expression of PTEN within these 2 patient groups. PTEN was more
highly expressed within the PI3K inactive group, which is
consistent with its well-established role as a suppressor of the
pathway (Fig. 6C; P ¼ 6.9e-06). Within stage III and IV tumors,

Figure 4. FOXO3a overexpression sensitizes SY5Y cells to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. A, Western blot analysis of exogenous FOXO3a after addition of 0.1
mg/mL doxycycline (Dox). The Western blot analysis was probed with an anti-HA tag antibody; a-tubulin was the loading control. B, Western blot analysis of
doxycycline and PI-103–treated SY5Y-TetR-FOXO3a cells with the indicated antibodies. A total of 0.1 mg/mL doxycycline was applied for 24 hours
before the incubation with 1 mmol/L PI-103 for 6 hours. C, cell nuclei from B were harvested and stained with PI for cell-cycle analysis by FACS. All
combinations were carried out in triplicate. D, SY5Y-TetR-FOXO3a cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. MTT assays
conducted at 24 and 48 hours to measure viability under 0.1 mg/mL doxycycline when treated with a gradient of either PI-103 or MK-2206. Each
concentration was carried out in triplicate.

the PI3K/AKT signature is also highly prognostic (Supplementary Fig. S3A; P ¼ 1.0e-06).
We subsequently aimed to identify a signature for FOXO3aregulated genes. We used the same SY5Y-TetR-FOXO3a cells,
but now we extended the analyses with doxycycline-induced
FOXO3a expression, with or without PI-103 treatment. Comparison of expression proﬁles of cells with and without doxycycline-induced FOXO3a expression, but without PI3K/AKT
inhibition by PI-103, yielded only 33 very weakly regulated
genes (data not shown). In contrast, the comparison of cells
with or without PI3K/AKT inhibition by PI-103, but with
FOXO3a transgene expression, identiﬁed 1,060 regulated
genes. These genes include genes regulated by FOXO3a, but
also genes regulated by PI3K/AKT signaling. The genes regulated by FOXO3a can be found by removing those also identiﬁed in the 464 gene PI3K/AKT signature, leaving a signature
of 809 FOXO3a-regulated genes (Supplementary Table S1B).
When a 2-group k-means clustering was conducted with these

2194

809 genes in the NB88 dataset, groups of 52 and 36 tumors were
generated (Supplementary Fig. S3B). As with the PI3K/AKT
signature, this division was also highly prognostic (P ¼ 9.7e-15;
Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Transcription factor–binding site analysis identiﬁes
putative direct FOXO3a target genes
To more stringently model FOXO3a regulatory activity and
identify likely direct target genes of FOXO3a, we conducted a
search for the FOXO DBE within the promoter regions of the
809 FOXO3a-regulated genes. As a prerequisite to this, we ﬁrst
conﬁrmed that FOXO3a was indeed activating the DBE element following our brief 6-hour treatment of the cells with PI103. For this, a FireFOX reporter assay was done in this line
under conditions identical to those of the mRNA proﬁling
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). We observed negligible transcriptional activity of FOXO3a with PI-103 treatment alone and a 3fold increase in activity in the þdox/þPI-103 condition relative

Figure 5. Induction of apoptosis positively correlates with FOXO3a protein levels and phosphorylation. Treatment of 11 cell lines seeded in 6-well plates with 8
mmol/L MK-2206 or DMSO for 48 hours. Nuclei were harvested for PI staining and FACS analysis and the differences between drug and no drug are displayed
as in Fig. 3B. Both conditions were carried out in triplicate for each cell line. Below the FACS data is a Western blot analysis of cell lysates from this panel treated

to the dox/PI-103 control. Unexpectedly, we also observed
a 1.5-fold increase in reporter activity with FOXO3a overexpression alone (þdox/PI-103), which did not ﬁt with the
lack of FOXO3a target regulation under this condition (33
weakly regulated genes when FOXO3a was overexpressed
without PI-103 treatment; data not shown). Cell fractionation
revealed that overexpressed FOXO3a was indeed entering the
nucleus without PI-103 treatment (data not shown). Despite
this, FOXO3a was apparently unable to activate its targets but
still able to activate a high-copy reporter. This implies that the
larger context of PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition may be essential for FOXO3a to regulate target genes in this cell line.
Having conﬁrmed that FOXO3a is transcriptionally activating DBE elements under these conditions, we classiﬁed the
FOXO3a-regulated genes into activated (n ¼ 419) and
repressed (n ¼ 284) groups. Of the 419 promoters activated
by FOXO3a, 167 contained the DBE element resulting in a
highly signiﬁcant FOXO motif enrichment (P ¼ 8.7e-06; Fig.
6D). Strikingly, no DBE element enrichment was found within
284 repressed promoters (P ¼ 0.99). This analysis is in agreement with a role for FOXO3a as an activator of gene transcription and suggests that repressed genes are indirectly regulated
by FOXO3a. Of the 464 genes regulated by PI3K/AKT, the
promoters of 407 upregulated genes only showed a marginally
signiﬁcant enrichment for the FOXO motif (P ¼ 0.05), whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

promoters of downregulated genes were not enriched (P ¼
0.69).
As a further validation of our FOXO3a activation system, we
investigated the regulation of 6 established FOXO target genes;
p27, BIM, MXI1, PIK3CA, RICTOR, and INSR (refs. 28–33; Supplementary Fig. S4B). These genes were all strongly upregulated with the combination of FOXO3a overexpression and PI103 treatment. Taken together with the reporter assay and
FOXO-binding site analysis, these results show that this system
is appropriate for the discovery of FOXO3a target genes.
PI3K/AKT and FOXO3a signatures give overlapping
classiﬁcations of neuroblastoma tumors
Using the 167 genes that were activated by FOXO3a and
contained the FOXO motif in their promoters, we conducted a
k-means clustering of the NB88 dataset (Supplementary Table
S1C and Fig. 6E). This identiﬁed a group of 49 tumors with
higher expression of most FOXO3a target genes relative to a
group of 39 tumors with lower expression. These groups exhibit
a very strong inverse correlation with the PI3K signature
clustering with 80 tumors exhibiting the expected pattern of
PI3K/AKT pathway activation and FOXO3a inactivation (91%
overlap). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves show a much
better prognosis for patients with tumors with an active
FOXO3a signature (Fig. 6F; P ¼ 3.8e-11). This was also true

within stage III and IV (Fig. 6G; P ¼ 4.2e-05). The interpretation
of this clustering was further conﬁrmed by the individual
Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the known FOXO target
genes p27, BIM, MXI1, and RICTOR (Supplementary Fig.
S5A). High expression of these genes was associated with a
good prognosis. Being that 3 of these genes are well-known
tumor suppressors, this is an indication that FOXO3a may
have a bias toward the activation of other such genes in
neuroblastoma.

Discussion
In this work, we have shown that FOXO3a is a highly
expressed and important mediator of cell death in neuroblastoma within the context of PI3K/AKT pathway inactivation.
Silencing of FOXO3a expression was sufﬁcient to rescue
SKNBE(2c) cells from the apoptosis induced by the PI3K

inhibitor PI-103 and overexpression potentiated this apoptotic
effect in SY5Y cells. Across a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines,
FOXO3a protein levels positively correlated with the induction
of apoptosis by the AKT inhibitor MK-2206. Microarray proﬁling of the SY5Y experiment elucidated gene expression
signatures for both the PI3K/AKT pathway and FOXO3a
transcriptional activity, which were both powerfully prognostic and inversely correlated within our NB88 tumor dataset.
It has been reported in other tumors that PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition can lead to a wide spectrum of direct effects
including cell-cycle arrest, induction of autophagy, sensitization to chemotherapeutics, inhibition of metastasis as well as
cell differentiation and death (18, 34). As a result, activation of
PI3K/AKT signaling in tumors is largely regarded as an oncogenic event with the implied corollary that FOXO inactivation
is just as frequently an oncogenic event due to its intimate

Tumor Suppressive Role of FOXO3a in Neuroblastoma

connection with the pathway. The notion that FOXO is a tumor
suppressor ﬁnds robust support in mouse models where FOXO
genes have been deleted (7). Moreover, numerous overexpression experiments of constitutively nuclear-localized FOXO
constructs resulted in the apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest of
various human tumor cell lines or blockade of transformation
(30, 35, 36). However, these seemingly straightforward results
are complicated by the increasing number of pathways and
posttranslational modiﬁcations that regulate FOXO activity
and in turn the myriad of outcomes FOXO activity can inﬂuence (19, 20). Recently, it has even been described that FOXO3a
can promote metastasis downstream of PI3K/AKT inhibition
in collusion with the WNT/b-catenin pathway in colon cancer
(37). All of these ﬁndings highlight that the ultimate outcomes
of FOXO transcriptional activation or inactivation are greatly
dependent on the context within which they occur. Here, we
have established that within the context of PI3K/AKT signaling
in neuroblastoma FOXO3a is indeed a tumor suppressor.
Our ﬁndings may have clinical implications for neuroblastoma therapy and potentially many other tumor models where
PI3K/AKT inhibitors are being considered for use. From our
gene expression signature for FOXO3a activation and functional work, we conclude that the administration of PI3K/AKT
inhibitors may induce cell death via re-activation of FOXO3a.
In addition, these drugs may cause the restoration of a gene
expression program within neuroblastomas associated with
very good prognosis and response to current therapy. This
makes a case for the use of these drugs in combination with
current therapies as they are predicted to synergize with them.
Support for this hypothesis has come from in vitro and in vivo
studies using PI-103 and MK-2206 in neuroblastoma (38, 39).
More directly, overexpression of constitutively active FOXO3a
has also yielded chemosensitization effects in neuroblastoma
cells (40). PI3K/AKT inhibitors may even be effective as single
agents in neuroblastoma due to the sensitivity of these cells to
FOXO3a-induced apoptosis, unlike glioma and acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia where these drugs are mainly cytostatic and the primary effect is a G1–S block (41–43). Another
possibility is FOXO-induced terminal neuronal differentiation
as recently shown in SY5Y cells (44). Interestingly, the rescue of
SKNBE(2c) from PI-103 showed an increased G1 arrest in the
FOXO3a knockdown background. This suggests that G1 arrest
may be the default outcome of PI3K/AKT inhibition if FOXO is
not abundantly present to drive apoptosis. This is further
supported by the FOXO3a overexpression in SY5Y where

despite increased p27 transcript levels following PI-103 treatment there was a decrease in G1 arrest as apoptosis increased.
It is also notable that the SKNBE(2c) line used in this study is
from a relapse bone marrow metastasis and is MYCN-ampliﬁed, radiation and multi-drug resistant and contains inactive
p53 (ref. 45). Despite these properties, this line is still responsive to PI3K/AKT inhibition and FOXO3a activation. To our
knowledge, this is also the ﬁrst report to suggest that FOXO3a
expression levels may be a biomarker for the efﬁcacy of PI3K/
AKT inhibitors. Further research will be needed to see if this
ﬁnding can be extended to other systems and if the other FOXO
family members may also have this correlation. Finally, the
ﬁnding that FOXO3a may function as an important tumor
suppressor in neuroblastoma will lead us to examine many
other pathways that are known to regulate it. Previously, we
identiﬁed oncogenic activation of FOXR1 in neuroblastoma as
another potential inhibitor of FOXO function (46). In conjunction with the current work, this ﬁnding suggests a broader role
for forkhead biology in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma.
This perspective may uncover additional prospects for targeted pharmacologic intervention.
