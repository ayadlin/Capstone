Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recognition of non-self molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors is a cornerstone of
innate immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) exert a key role in recognizing pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) but have also been implicated in the recognition of damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs). As such, TLRs regulate a wide range of biological
responses including inflammatory and immune responses during carcinogenesis. The high
expression of TLRs by antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, and their ability to
induce anti-tumor mediators such as type I interferon has led to efforts to utilize TLR agonists in
tumor therapy in order to convert the often tolerant immune response towards anti-tumor
responses. However, TLRs are also increasingly recognized as regulators of tumor-promoting
inflammation and promoters of tumor survival signals. Here, we will review in detail the
dichotomous role of TLRs in tumor biology, focusing on relevant TLR-dependent pro- and antitumor pathways, and discuss clinical applications of TLR-targeted therapies for tumor prevention
and treatment.

Introduction
150 years after Virchow’s postulate, the link between inflammation and cancer has been
firmly established by epidemiologic investigations and animal studies 1,2. 18% of human
cancers are attributable to infection, and chronic inflammation triggered by infection is an
important contributor to carcinogenesis 3,4. In addition, injury may trigger local
inflammation 5, and obesity can contribute to a general hyperinflammatory state 6. While
many tumors arise in the setting of inflammation, it is present in virtually all established
tumors. Although inflammation is controlled by numerous mediators and pathways, several
systems function as key upstream regulators. Among these are pattern recognition receptors
(PRR) that sense danger by detecting non-self or altered molecular patterns. Toll-like

receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized PRRs for the detection of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMP-induced TLR activation triggers a profound activation
of multiple proinflammatory and anti-viral signaling cascades to achieve pathogen
elimination. However, if pathogens cannot be eliminated, they may elicit chronic
inflammation, which may also in part be mediated through TLRs 7,8. The important
contribution of inflammation to carcinogenesis is best exemplified by high rates of
colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease, high rates of gastric cancer in patients
infected by H. pylori, and high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic
hepatitis 1. Accordingly, TLR-induced inflammation may act as a promoter of
carcinogenesis, with recent studies showing strong promotion of carcinogenesis in the colon,
liver, stomach and pancreas by TLRs 9–13. In addition to PAMP-induced TLR activation,
inflammation and injury also induce the release of endogenous molecules termed damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs), some of which act as ligands for TLRs 5. Notably,
signals triggered by DAMPs may promote carcinogenesis in a TLR-dependent manner 14.
On the other hand, inflammatory responses may not only provide tumor-promoting signals
but also contribute to anti-tumor immune responses 15,16. After decades of debate, cancer
immunosurveillance has been convincingly proven, as demonstrated by increased tumor
rates in RAG2−/− mice or mice that lack IFNγ signaling 17. However, we still do not know
how well and in what type of tumors this system works. Based on increased immunogenicity
of tumor transplants from immunosuppressed mice, it has been suggested that this system
contributes to tumor elimination in early stages, but that escape mechanisms develop,
resulting in long-term failure 16. One interesting aspect linking bacterial PAMPs and antitumor responses are historic observations, made by Busch, Bruns and Coley, that bacterial
infections such as erysipelas or injection of heat-killed Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia
marcescens (“Coley’s toxin”) may lead to tumor regression and sometimes even cure 18–21.
Although the mechanisms behind these historic studies remain obscure, recent advances in
TLR biology and clinical studies with TLR agonists have suggested that TLR activation may
indeed represent a relevant anti-tumor pathway, allowing to convert immune tolerance to
anti-tumor immune responses 22–25. Here, we will briefly review TLR signaling, before
discussing the dichotomous role of TLRs in tumor biology, with a particular focus on
mechanisms by which TLRs may promote or inhibit cancer. Finally, we will highlight
potential applications of TLR-targeting drugs for tumor prevention and therapy.

1. TLRs and TLR signaling
TLR signaling has been reviewed in detail elsewhere 26–28, and we will only summarize key
concepts. TLRs are PRRs that recognize a wide range of bacterial, viral and fungal PAMPs,
as well as endogenous DAMPs such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Although
individual TLRs recognize distinct ligands, the mechanisms of TLR activation and signal
transduction are highly conserved (see Fig. 1). Ligand binding occurs via leucine-rich
repeats (LRRs) of extracellular TLR domains and triggers signal transduction pathways
through interaction of intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains with conserved
adaptor molecules. Most TLRs signal through the adapter molecule MyD88. Only TLR3 and
TLR4 signal through a MyD88-independent pathway that relies on the adapter molecule
Trif. TLR4 is the only receptor that signals through MyD88 and Trif. The MyD88-

dependent and MyD88-independent pathways activate multiple proinflammatory signaling
cascades including NF-κB, JNK/AP1, ERK and p38, and as well as the interferon
pathway 26–28.

2. Tumor promoting actions of TLRs
TLRs may promote carcinogenesis through proinflammatory, anti-apopototic, proliferative
and profibrogenic signals in either the tumor microenvironment (TME) or tumor cells
themselves, as described below. These effects can be either induced directly in TLRexpressing target cells, or mediated by TLR-induced cytokines.
2.1. TLR-mediated inflammation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

TLRs are key regulators of inflammatory signaling, mediated by MyD88-dependent and
MyD88-independent pathways. One important tumor-promoting signaling pathway induced
by TLR signaling is the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB is a master switch of
inflammation regulating the transcription of more than 100 proinflammatory genes 29, and is
closely related to the avian viral oncoprotein v-Rel 30. TLR signaling upregulates wellknown tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB-dependent pathways,
including IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6 31–33. These cytokines promote cancers in the intestine,
liver, stomach and skin 34–40. TLR2-mediated inflammatory signals in macrophages,
triggered by tumor-derived, TLR2-agonistic ECM protein versican, promote the secretion of
TNFα and metastasis 41. Besides inflammation, NF-κB activation results in a wide range of
cellular responses such as prevention of apoptosis (discussed below), proliferation and antioxidant defenses 42,43. Oxidative stress that typically occurs in the setting of chronic
inflammation may not only contribute to the activation of tumor-promoting inflammatory
signaling pathways 44 but also change molecular patterns and result in formation of DAMPs
with TLR2-activating properties by lipid oxidation 45.
2.2. TLR-mediated anti-apoptotic effects

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Resisting cell death is a hallmark of cancer 46,47, counteracting many of the control
mechanisms that destroy malignant cells. NF-κB is considered the most relevant antiapoptotic pathway that controls the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and also restricts the
activation of proapoptotic pathways such as JNK 48,49. TLR signaling activates NF-κB both
through MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. Moreover, TLRs stimulate
the release of cytokines IL-1β and TNFα that in turn promote NF-κB activation in target
cells. The key role of TLR signaling in cytoprotection is highlighted by the enhanced
susceptibility of MyD88-deficient mice to dextrane sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis 50,
which is at least in part mediated by decreased in cytoprotective pathways. Likewise, in the
liver and the lung, toxic injury is suppressed in a TLR-dependent manner 9,51,52. TLR
signaling may not only play a role in regulating injury responses in chronically injured
precancerous organs but also in promoting survival of malignant cells. As such, TLRinduced NF-κB activation promotes tumor cell survival in colon cancer 53, liver cancer 9,
stomach cancer 11 and lung cancer 54. Moreover, TLR4 on tumor cells mediates resistance
of tumor cells to cell death induced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and promotes tumor growth
in vivo 55. In addition to NF-κB activation in TLR-expressing tumors, survival signals could

also be provided by TLR-expressing cells in the TME such as tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM) or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that release IL-1β or TNFα,
which then act on tumor cells (see Fig. 2). Conditional ablation of TLRs in tumor cells and
the TME will be required to differentiate between these two possibilities.
2.3. TLR-mediated promotion of wound healing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The similarities between tumor stroma and wounds have led to the suggestion that cancers
represent “wounds that do not heal” and a final stage of uncontrolled tissue repair
processes 56. Wound healing responses may strongly promote carcinogenesis as
demonstrated by studies with Rous sarcoma virus, in which injury and wound healing of
infected animals amplifies carcinogenesis 57. The two events in the wound healing response
that are influenced by TLR signaling include (i) epithelial regeneration and (ii)
myofibroblast activation. The liver is the best-known example for the epithelial regeneration
with restoration of mass after 70% partial hepatectomy within 7–10 days. Although deletion
of single TLRs does not affect regeneration, deletion of the common TLR adapter MyD88 or
elimination of intestinally-derived TLR ligands in germ-free mice suppresses liver
regeneration 58–60. A contribution of TLR signaling to regeneration is also found in the
intestine, where a TLR2/TLR4/MyD88 signaling cascade mediates epithelial regeneration
after DSS-mediated injury 53,61, and in the skin, where lack of MyD88 slows the healing of
excisional skin wounds 62. In the intestine and liver, TLR-MyD88 signaling regulates the
expression of mitogenic EGF receptor ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin in nonhematopoietic cells. Accordingly, epiregulin-deficient mice display discreased tumor
development in the liver and colon 9,63.
The accumulation of extracellular matrix constitutes a second event that may promote
carcinogenesis in a TLR-dependent manner. Fibroblasts and fibroblast precursors
functionally express TLR2 64,65 TLR4 66–69 and TLR9 70. Notably, TLR4 promotes fibrosis
development in the liver, as demonstrated by the protective effect of TLR4-, CD14-, MD-2-,
MyD88- and Trif-deficiency 71–73. Mice lacking TLR2 and TLR9 also display a reduction
of hepatic fibrosis 70,74. TLRs exert only moderate profibrogenic effects in other organs,
such as skin and kidney, but have no role in lung fibrosis 75.

3. TLR-mediated anti-tumor signals
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the concept of tumor immunosurveillance is well established, the immune system
is much more efficient at triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation in response to pathogens
than at recognizing and eliminating tumors. In the past two decades, pharmacologic studies
have established that boostering the activation of pathways, which is efficiently triggered by
pathogens but not by tumors, such as TLRs and downstream mediators such as type I
interferons, can be therapeutically employed to shift the balance from immunotolerance to
anti-tumor effects. In particular, TLR7 agonists and interferon alpha have shown therapeutic
efficacy in melanoma, basal cell cancer, renal cell cancer, and hairy cell leukemia 76.

3.1. TLR-mediated effects on dendritic cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because tumor cells are poor antigen-presenting cells (APC), anti-tumor immune responses
typically depend on professional APCs such as DC 77. As professional APCs, that express a
large number of PRR including TLRs and exert powerful effects on lymphocytes, DC are at
the interface of innate and adaptive immune responses. Although DC have been in the focus
of tumor immunology for their ability to launch potent anti-tumor responses, lacking
activation of DC – often a result of inhibitory signals from tumor cells – may also induce
immune tolerance through T cell deletion or through regulatory T cells (Treg) 77,78, thus
allowing tumor progression. As type I interferon is absolutely required for immune rejection
of tumors by DC 79,80, activation of the TLR-IFN signaling pathway represents a therapeutic
approach to shift the balance from DC tolerance to anti-tumor response. TLR-activated DC
may mediate anti-tumor responses not only through antigen presentation and effects on T
cells 81,82 but also through direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Accordingly, both
classical and plasmacytoid DC, activated by TLR7 agonists, acquire the ability to induce
anti-tumor responses and lyse tumor cells 83–85. Likewise, TLR5 activation also increases
tumoricidal activity of DC 86. It is possible that DC-mediated tumor killing subsequently
triggers amore efficient antigen-presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus amplifying
anti-tumor responses. Different DC subsets such as TLR9-stimulated plasmacytoid DC and
myeloid DC engage in a crosstalk that promotes anti-tumor responses 87.
3.2. TLR- and IFN-mediated effects on natural killer cells
One of the earliest described immunoregulatory functions of type I IFN—its ability to
regulate natural killer (NK) cell functions 88 has now been proven to be one of the major
mechanisms of the regulation of tumor growth by endogenous type I IFN. Poly I:C-mediated
TLR3 stimulation of myeloid DC induces NK activation and NK-mediated tumor regression
in a mouse model of melanoma 89. A novel molecule termed IRF-3-dependent NKactivating molecule (INAM) provides a link between myeloid DC and NK cells89.
3.3. Inhibition of regulatory T cell functions by TLR signals

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CD4+CD25+ Treg play an important role in immunity and tolerance as evidenced by
development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases following their depletion 90. Activation
of TLRs on DC regulates T cell activation not only through MHC class II and costimulatory
molecules, but also through TLR-induced signals in DC that block the suppressive effect of
Tregs in an IL-6 dependent manner 91. In addition, synthetic and natural ligands for human
TLR8 can directly inhibit Treg cell function, independent of DC, and promote anti-tumor
immunity 92. Altogether, these data demonstrate that TLR activation can release the brake in
anti-tumor immunity via Tregs.
3.4. Additional mechanisms through which TLRs exert anti-tumor effects
Treatment with TLR3 agonist poly I:C may induce tumor regression by converting tumorsupporting macrophages to tumor suppressors that produce inflammatory cytokines and
promote M1 polarization. This response is mediated by TNFα through a MyD88independent pathway 93. TLR9 agonists can also exert anti-tumor effects through
suppression of angiogenesis 94. It is likely that TLR-induced interferons play an important

role as interferon alpha is well known to reduce tumor growth by blocking
angiogenesis 95–97.

4. Role of specific TLRs and their ligands in experimental and human
carcinogenesis
The most profound contribution of TLRs to carcinogenesis has been observed in organs that
are either directly exposed to bacterial TLR ligands such as the GI tract and skin, or
indirectly exposed to high amounts of intestinal TLR ligands such as the liver. Thus, tumorpromoting proinflammatory TLR activation seems to be triggered by bacterial PAMPs.
Accordingly, germ-free animals display reduced carcinogenesis in the liver and the GI
tract 9,98–100. However, in other organs, e.g. the pancreas, DAMPs may be the main stimulus
for TLR-dependent carcinogenesis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

TLRs exert a dichotomous role in cancer. The amplitude and length of receptor activation
may have a critical impact on outcome, with chronic low-grade TLR activation favoring a
tumor-promoting proinflammatory state, and high-dose therapeutic TLR activation
promoting anti-tumor response. Here we summarize results from the most relevant studies
and classify TLRs as “largely tumor-promoting” or “largely tumor-suppressing”, with the
caveat that TLRs have divergent functions in an organ-, cell-, context- and ligand-dependent
manner, and that the literature contains conflicting data.
4.1. TLRs and TLR adapter molecules with largely tumor promoting functions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

4.1.1. TLR4—Tumor-promoting functions of TLR4 are best established in the colon, liver,
pancreas and skin. In colon, where there is constant interaction between gut microbiota and
epithelial cells, TLR4 deletion strongly reduces inflammation and tumor burden in a colitisassociated neoplasia using the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model 101. Furthermore,
transgenic mice overexpressing constitutively activated TLR4 in the intestine exhibit a
higher sensitivity to colitis-associated neoplasia 102. These studies are in agreement with
other studies in which either deletion of the TLR4 adapter molecule Myd88 103, or depletion
of the gut microbiota, which supplies TLR4-activating PAMPs such as LPS, reduce colon
cancer development 103,104. In contrast, one recent study showed that intestinal
overexpression of constitutively activated TLR4 in the APCMin model of colon reduces
tumor load by increasing tumor cell apoptosis 105. In the liver, several studies have
demonstrated a tumor-promoting role of TLR4 9,51. Moreover, germ-free status or
elimination of the gut microbiota by antibiotics decrease hepatocarcinogenesis 9. Likewise,
dysbiosis induced by penicillin increases development of liver cancer whereas treatment
with probiotics improves it 106. TLR4-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis is mediated by nonbone marrow-derived cells. In contrast to these numerous studies, a single study showed
increased hepatocarcinogenesis in TLR4-deficient mice 107. In the skin, TLR4- and Myd88deficient mice exhibited a strong reduction in tumor numbers induced by two-step chemical
carcinogenesis 39,108. Carcinogenesis in the skin depends on TLR4 expressed by myeloid
and epithelial cells, and the endogenous TLR4 ligand HMGB1. MyD88-dependent
promotion of skin carcinogenesis not only depends on TLR but also on IL-1R signaling 39.
The fact that TLR4 exerts a protective role in a non-inflammatory model of skin

carcinogenesis suggests that the effect of TLR4 on skin cancer may be contextdependent 109. In the pancreas, TLR4 deletion decreases tumor growth, while chronic LPS
treatment accelerates cancer progression 13. Tumor-promoting effects of TLR4 in pancreatic
cancer are mediated by bone marrow-derived cells 13. In contrast to largely tumorpromoting role of TLR4 in the colon, liver, skin and pancreas, TLR4 in lung and breast
inhibits cancer development: Mice expressing non-functional TLR4 exhibit increased tumor
load in a 3-methylcholanthrene-induced lung cancer model 110. Similarly, TLR4 promotes
breast cancer development, progression and metastasis in chemical carcinogenesis and
syngeneic transplant models 111,112. Further studies are required to understand the organspecific contribution TLR4. It is conceivable that TLR4-activating PAMPs act
predominantly as potential tumor promoters, whereas DAMPs function as potential tumor
suppressors. Accordingly, chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy require TLR4-activating
DAMPs to achieve therapeutic effects: HMGB1 is released following anthracycline
treatment or radiotherapy resulting in HMGB1-mediated TLR4 activation on DC and tumor
elimination by tumor-specific T cells. 113. Despite the large body of literature on TLR4 in
experimental carcinogenesis, the functional contribution of TLR4 to human carcinogenesis
is not well understood. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that render TLR4 less
responsive, such as Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, may be associated with precancerous gastric
lesions, and increased risk of gallbladder cancer 114,115. However, large-scale confirmatory
studies are missing. The contribution of other TLR4 SNPs to carcinogenesis remains
elusive 116. Patients that received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for breast
cancer had increased metastasis and decreased metastasis-free survival when carrying the
Asp299Gly TLR4 variant, confirming the contribution of TLR4 to chemo- and
radiotherapy 113.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

4.1.2. TLR2—TLR2 may promote or suppress tumor growth in a context-dependent
manner. A profound tumor-promoting role has been observed in gastric cancer. TLR2 is
upregulated in human and murine gastric cancer samples 11. In a genetic mouse model of
gastric cancer, deletion of TLR2 results in a drastically reduced tumor load 11. TLR2mediated promotion of gastric cancer is independent of bone marrow-derived cells, and is
mediated by proliferation and survival signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and
NF-κB in the epithelial compartment 11. In lung cancer, TLR2 exerts tumor- and metastasispromoting effects. Lung cancer cells secrete extracellular matrix component versican,
resulting in versican-mediated TLR2 stimulation and IL-6 and TNF production in
macrophage and promotion of metastatic growth 41. In the liver, TLR2 does not affect
hepatocarcinogenesis in the setting of chronic injury 9. However, in a purely genotoxic
model of liver cancer, TLR2 knockout mice exhibit a higher number of tumors and
decreased survival 117. Tumor cells from TLR2 knockout mice showed a lower amount of
cell death and a suppressed senescence program. Similar to the liver, the role TLR2 remains
controversial in colorectal cancer. In one study, there were no differences in colorectal
cancer between wild-type and TLR2-deficient mice using the AOM-DSS model 118. In
contrast, another study reported increased tumor development and higher IL-6, IL-17A and
phospho-STAT3 levels in colorectal cancer in TLR2-deficient mice using a similar AOMDSS model 119. TLR2 may also be the mediator of angiogenesis-promoting lipid oxidation
end products such as ω-(2-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) 45. These products are not only

generated during inflammation and wound healing but accumulate in highly vascularized
tumors such as melanoma, and induce a VEGF-independent angiogenic response that
depends on TLR2 45. The role of TLR2 in human carcinogenesis is not well understood. In
gastric cancer, STAT3 pathway activation and increased TLR2 expression are associated
with poor survival 11. Although TLR2 polymorphisms have been associated with gastric and
cervical cancer risk 120,121, large-scale confirmatory studies are missing.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

4.1.3 Adaptor Molecules and Regulators of TLR signaling—Myeloiddifferentiation factor 88 (MyD88) mediates downstream signaling of the majority of TLR
family members, as well as the receptors for IL-1 and IL-18 (see Fig. 1). The L265P
mutation in the TIR domain of MyD88 mutations caused constitutive activation of NF-κB
and JAK-STAT pathways and increased survival of malignant cells, thereby contributing to
the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia 122–124. Conversely, deletion of MyD88 decreases carcinogenesis in
many settings, including genetic and chemical models of colon cancer 103, chemicallyinduced hepatocarcinogenesis 36 and chemical models of skin papilloma and
fibrosarcoma 125. In contrast, deletion of MyD88 results in aggressive fibroinflammation,
increased Th2 responses, and profoundly accelerated tumorigenesis in a genetic model of
pancreatic cancer 13. In the latter model, carcinogenesis is driven by the MyD88independent TRIF pathway, suggesting that MyD88 deletion might promote tumors by
overactivation of the TRIF pathway 13. SIGIRR is a member of the TLR/IL-1 receptor
superfamily, and acts as a negative regulator of TLR and IL-1 signaling 126. Mice deficient
in SIGGIR not only display constitutive expression of inflammatory genes in the colon, that
depends on the bacterial microbiota, but also increased inflammation following DSS, and
increased tumorigenesis in the AOM+DSS model 127.
4.2. TLRs with largely tumor-suppressive functions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

4.2.1. TLR3—TLR3 predominantly serves a tumor-suppressive function, largely mediated
by TLR3-dependent stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. Accordingly, TLR3 deficiency
results in development of acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia after infection with
endogenous retrovirus 128. In syngeneic and xenograft models of prostate cancer, TLR3
deficient mice display increased tumor growth rate 129. Conversely, treatment with TLR3
agonist poly I:C inhibits tumor growth in the latter model and a genetic model of prostate
cancer overexpressing the TRAMP transgene 129. Systemic administration of poly I:C
reduces the growth of melanoma metastasis 130. In the liver, there is a positive correlation
between TLR3 expression and patient survival 131. Moreover, poly I:C treatment increased
NK cell activation and reduced liver tumor growth in a syngeneic transplant model 131.
Consistently in all models, TLR3 downstream effects are mediated by type I interferon and
subsequent NK cell or DC activation, and NK cell- or DC-mediated death of tumor cells. In
contrast to the above studies, it has also been suggested that TLR3 could promote tumor
development through effects on cell proliferation and survival 132,133.
TLR5: The majority of studies deciphering the contribution of TLR5 to tumor development
have revealed potent anti-tumor effects, consistent with the expression and function of TLR5
on DC and their important role in anti-tumor immune responses. These effects are best

exemplified in a study where tumor cell lines expressing TLR5 agonist flagellin fused with a
tumor antigen induced DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response 82. In the colon,
knockdown of TLR5 or MyD88 dramatically enhanced growth and inhibited necrosis in a
xenograft model 134. TLR5 is highly expressed in human breast cancer biopsies compared to
non-tumor tissue 135. Implantation of TLR5-deleted breast tumor cells results in enhanced
tumor growth while TLR5 agonist flagellin retarded tumor growth by increasing cell death
and decreasing tumor cell proliferation 135. However, the use of immunodeficient mouse
models that lack DC, is an important limitation of the above studies. Therefore, the tumorsuppressive function of TLR5 requires additional investigations in mice with a fully
functional immune system.

TLR7/TLR8: TLR7 and TLR8 are structurally related receptors for single-stranded RNA,
TLR7 and 8 have been the focus of research on TLRs and cancer due to the profound
immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects of small-molecule agonists 136–139. While there
is considerable data on the clinical application of potent TLR7/8 agonists for anti-tumor
therapy, relatively little is known about the contribution of endogenous TLR7/8 activation to
carcinogenesis. A recent publication demonstrated that microRNAs, released from tumors
via exosomes, bind to TLR7 and 8, and favor metastatic growth 140, suggesting that lowlevel activation of TLR7/8 by endogenous agonists exert tumor-promoting effects. TLR7/8
agonists are predominantly used for anti-tumor therapy of basal cell carcinoma and
melanoma 136 (discussed in the next section). Anti-tumor effects are predominantly
mediated by TLR7/8 activation on DC, resulting in their recruitment, activation and ability
to kill tumor cells 83,85. Moreover, TLR7/8-activated DC also activate NK cells and
suppress Treg 92,141,142. Despite the overwhelming literature on anti-tumor effects of
TLR7/8 agonists recent studies suggest a potential tumor-promoting role TLR7/8 in some
settings: In pancreatic cancer, there is not only a high expression of TLR7 in both epithelial
and inflammatory cells, but also an acceleration of tumor formation following TLR7
activation 12. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of TLR7 decreases pancreatic cancer.
TLR7 exerts its effects on pancreatic cancer in inflammatory cells as chimeric mice with
absent TLR7 expression in bone marrow-derived cells displayed decreased
carcinogenesis 12. In the lung, both TLR7 and TLR8 are expressed on tumor cells, and
promote the survival of lung cancer cell lines through NF-κB activation and upregulation of
Bcl-2 54. As discussed above, TLR7/8-agonistic microRNAs promote lung tumor
growth 140. Thus, the effects of TLR7/8 on tumor may depend on the organ, tumor stage, the
cell type, and the role that anti-tumor immune responses play in a particular tumor. In light
of the potential clinical applications of TLR7/8 agonists for anti-tumor therapies, further
pharmacologic and genetic studies are required to understand in which organs and settings
TLR7/8 signaling promotes cancer.
TLR9: TLR9 is the receptor for non-methylated CpG DNA that is typically found in viral
and bacterial DNA 143. Similar to TLR7/8, TLR9 has been extensively studied for its role in
immunosurveillance and as potential target for anti-tumor therapy using synthetic TLR9
agonists. The contribution of TLR9 to immunosurveillance is highlighted by the fact that
TLR9 deficiency results in acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia after infection with
endogenous retrovirus infection 128. These data suggest that TLR9 may be particularly

relevant for virally induced tumors. Conversely, TLR9 activation by synthetic
oligodeoxynucleotide agonists (CpG-ODN) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in
xenograft models of murine cervical carcinoma, neuroblastoma and colon cancer 143–147.
Likewise, the combination of TLR9 agonists with Stat3 siRNA in a single molecule
promoted anti-tumor responses against subcutaneously implanted melanoma cells, while at
the same time suppressing the Stat3-mediated immunosuppression in the TME 148. CpGODNs are studied for the treatment of different tumor types as a single therapeutic agent 143,
as well as in combination with radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy 149 (discussed
in the next section). Mechanistically, TLR9 agonists induce type I interferon secretion in DC
resulting in cytotoxic DC, activation of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, all of which
contribute an antitumor immune response 143,150–153. In addition to immune cells, TLR9 is
also expressed on tumor cells from many tissues 55,154 but the function of TLR9 on tumor
cells in vivo is currently not known. As it is conceivable that TLR9 stimulation may be celland context-dependent and possibly contribute to tumor cell survival or proliferation,
additional studies in TLR9-deficient mice are needed to investigate the functional role of
TLR9 in carcinogenesis in vivo 155–158.

5. TLRs as therapeutic targets for tumor prevention and therapy
Once ranked among the top 20 immunotherapy drugs for the cure of cancer, the role of
TLRs in cancer biology has not only become more complex with recent studies revealing a
tumor-promoting effect of several TLRs, but has also been set back by disappointing results
from several phase II and phase III clinical trials 159. Altogether, these results are leading to
more differentiated approaches that requires focus on (i) tumors amenable to
immunotherapy, (ii) TLRs that promote anti-tumor responses most efficiently and for which
a tumor-promoting role has been excluded, and (iii) combination therapies to boost immune
responses to specific antigens, targeting in particular DC. The majority of clinical trials have
been performed using TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists (Fig. 3A). On the other side of the
spectrum of TLR biology, targeting specific tumor-promoting TLRs such as TLR2 and
TLR4, or their ligands for tumor-prevention represents a new and evolving philosophy that
could eventually be translated into clinical trials for primary or secondary tumor prevention.
5.1. TLR agonists for the induction of anti-tumor responses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5.1.1. TLR7/8 agonists—The most successful translation of immunomodulatory and anticancer effects of all TLR agonists has been achieved for TLR7/8. Accordingly, the TLR7/8
agonist imiquimod is the only TLR agonist approved for cancer therapy. As TLR7 and
TLR8 both recognize ssRNA, many synthetic agonists activate both receptors. Several
classes of TLR7/8 agonists have been developed 160: Imidazoquinoline, which resemble
adenosine analogues, include the TLR7 agonist imiquimod 138 and the TLR7/8 agonist
resiquimod; guanosine analogues such as the TLR7 ligand loxoribine; and ssRNA that has
been stabilized to prevent its rapid degradation. Modifications of their RNA sequence can
direct ligands specifically towards TLR7 or TLR8 142. Among all TLR7/8 ligands,
imiquimod is the best studied 136 and in clinical use: Topical administration of Aldara™ (5%
imiquimod cream) has been approved by the FDA and the European Union for the treatment
of basal cell carcinoma, and achieves a clearance rate of 42–100% 161,162. Imiquimod is also

being used to locally treat other cutaneous tumors including melanoma with welldocumented and >85% success rates for lentigo maligna 163 (Fig. 3B). Evidence is
accumulating that it may also be effective in more advanced stages such as invasive
cutaneous and locally recurrent melanoma 164–166 Topical imiquimod treatment is also
utilized in a phase II clinical trial in breast cancer patients with chest wall recurrence or
cutaneous metastasis 22,167 (Fig. 3B). Despite success with topical treatment, the role of
TLR7/8 agonists for systemic therapy remains uncertain. Unlike imiquimod, the TLR7
agonist 852A and the TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 can be applied systemically and are
currently being evaluated in phase I and phase II clinical trials for various cancers including
melanoma breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical and head and neck cancers (Fig. 3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5.1.2. TLR9—Although a large number of clinical trials have been performed using TLR9
agonists, there is currently no FDA-approved TLR9 agonist for tumor therapy. A number of
CpG-containing TLR9 agonists have been tested in animal models, including cervical
carcinoma, neuroblastoma and colon cancer 143–147, and in clinical trials 22. Despite
promising preclinical studies, several clinical trials have been disappointing, e.g. failure of
TLR9 agonists CGP 7909 in a Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer, and safety
concerns of IMO-2055 in combination with platinum-based therapies Phase II trial in
recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer,
respectively 159. Results from other ongoing studies of TLR9 agonist MGN1703 for
metastatic colorectal cancer and TLR9 agonist EMD1201081 for head and neck cancer (Fig.
3B) need to be awaited to judge the role of TLR9 in cancer therapy. Because of these
somewhat discouraging clinical studies, focus has shifted towards the ability of TLR9
agonists to activate DC and improve responses to tumor vaccines. The combination of the
TLR9 agonist CPG7909, the TLR4 agonist MPL, and the melanoma antigen MAGE-A3 is
currently being tested in a Phase III clinical trial (Fig. 3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5.1.3. TLR5—Although there is significant data in mice showing anti-tumor effects by
TLR5 agonists flagellin 82,135,168 and TLR5-agonistic polyethylenimine-based
nanoparticles, that are selectively engulfed by tumor-associated tolerogenic DC 86,
translation into clinical practice has not been achieved. CBLB502 (Entolimod) is a TLR5
agonist that is derived from Salmonella flagellin 169 that is currently studied in phase I
clinical trials in patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer, and in locally advanced
or metastatic solid tumors (Fig. 3B).
5.1.4 TLR3—Despite evidence of tumor-suppressing effects of TLR3 ligand poly I:C in
several mouse studies 129,130, there is little data on anti-tumor effects of TLR3 ligands in
humans. As poly I:C is inactivated rapidly in humans, several TLR3 ligands have been
developed for clinical applications. Poly-ICLC (Hiltinol™) is a derivative of poly I:C that
has been stabilized with poly-lysine, and is currently studied in phase II trials for solid
tumors (Fig. 3B). Rintatolimod (Ampligen™) is a derivate of poly I:C in which cytidine is
replaced by uridine at a ratio of 1:12 (polyI:polyC12U). Rintatolimod is employed in
combination with vaccines for the treatment of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer, as well as
brain tumors (Fig. 3B). The dsRNA mimic IPH-3102 is another TLR3 agonist, but there is
no available data on animal studies or clinical trials.

5.1.5 TLR2, TLR4 and mixed agonists—Although TLR2 and TLR4 mediate tumor
promotion in many types of mouse cancers, they may exert anti-tumor effects in others, and
have been investigated for tumor therapy as well as adjuvants for vaccination. Although
strictly not a pure TLR agonist, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) mediates many of its
immunomodulatory effects through TLR2 and TLR4 24. Anti-tumor effects of BCG are
known for over 40 years 170–173. BCG is effective in the treatment of bladder cancer 174–176
(Fig. 3B) and has been approved by the FDA for this purpose. BCG remains the only known
effective tumor therapeutic with TLR2/4 agonistic effects. Although BCG has been
evaluated in clinical trials for a large number of other tumors, these have been largely
disappointing 25. OM-174 (CXR-526), a derivative from Escherichia coli lipid A, is a mixed
TLR2/TLR4 agonist. OM-174 has been evaluated in a Phase I study in patients with solid
tumors, and is an adjuvant for an autologous DC vaccine for melanoma in a Phase I/II
clinical trial (Fig. 3B). Stimuvax is a cancer vaccine against the tumor antigen MUC1 that
contains TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), but failed to improve non-small cell
lung cancer 177. In summary, with the exception of the non-specific TLR2/TLR4-agonistic
BCG, there is currently no data showing clear anti-tumor activity of TLR2 or TLR4 agonists
in clinical trials.

5.2. TLR antagonism for tumor prevention
Based on recent data on tumor promoting effects of TLRs in organs such as the colon, liver
and pancreas, inhibition of TLR signaling may represent a novel strategy for tumor
prevention. However, knowledge from animal models has not been translated into the clinic
and there are currently no ongoing trials. Here we summarize potential therapeutic strategies
for tumor prevention:

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5.2.1. Modulation of gut microbiome and bacterial translocation by probiotics
and antibiotics—The gut microbiome is the main source for bacterial TLR ligands, which
may contribute to carcinogenesis in the stomach, colon and liver. Modulating the gut
microbiome and/or bacterial translocation by probiotics or antibiotics may represent
clinically feasible approaches to reduce TLR-mediated inflammatory and tumor promoting
signals. 178. In murine models of colon cancer, administration of synbiotics but not pro- or
prebiotics alone, prevented aberrant crypt foci formation in AOM-induced colon
cancer 179,180. In a rat model of liver carcinogenesis, administration of the probiotic VSL#3
strongly reduced liver tumor formation 106. In a genetic mouse model of colorectal cancer
short-term antibiotic treatment reduces the pro-tumorigenic expression of IL-23 in TAM
while long-term depletion of gut microflora, reduces tumor number and size 181. A recent
study confirmed these findings in a different model of colon cancer, where gut sterilization
limits the development of colonic dysplasia 182. In liver cancer, gut sterilization by oral
antibiotics results in drastically reduced tumor burden in mouse and rat models 9,51.
Notably, effects of antibiotics are more pronounced when given at late stages of
hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting that gut microbiome modulation by antibiotics might be
useful in clinical settings, where early prevention treatment typically is not possible. While
the above used antibiotics cannot be applied in patients long-term, recent data also suggests
that well tolerated non-absorbable antibiotics such as Rifaximin reduce liver tumors in
murine hepatocarcinogenesis 9. Rifaximin is approved for the treatment of hepatic

encephalopathy and well-tolerated 183. However, neither probiotics nor antibiotics have yet
been studied for primary or secondary tumor prevention in patients. In advanced liver
disease, Rifaximin could be used to hit “two birds with one stone” by reducing hepatic
encephalopathy and preventing liver cancer development.
5.2.1. TLR2 and TLR4 antagonist for tumor prevention—The TLR4 inhibitors
CRX-526 and E5564 are synthetic analogs of the lipid A portion of LPS, and prevent
binding of LPS to the TLR4-MD2 complex and TLR4 activation. TAK-242 is a TLR4
antagonist that acts on the intracellular domain of TLR4. Although these TLR antagonists
effectively prevent LPS-mediated inflammation and lethality 184–186, they have not been
investigated in animal models or clinical trials for tumor prevention. Likewise, the TLR2inhibitory humanized monoclonal antibody OPN305, reduces inflammation in vivo 187 but
has not been investigated for tumor prevention.

Conclusion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Knowledge about the contribution of TLRs to cancer as well as clinical trials employing
TLR agonists for anti-tumor therapy have increased tremendously. The most relevant
scientific discoveries in the field of TLRs and cancer biology in the past decade has been the
realization that TLRs may promote tumor formation in certain organs such as the colon,
stomach, pancreas and liver. This knowledge needs to be integrated into current future
clinical trials. Although only few approaches have been found to be successful, including the
local TLR7 agonist imiquimod and the non-specific TLR2/4 agonist BCG, testing of new
TLR agonists, combinations and indications for TLR-based anti-tumor therapy is still
ongoing. Integration of TLR agonists as adjuvants into DC-based cancer vaccination has
become a new focus 77 that may constitute a new and efficient modality of tumor therapy in
the future. Moreover, the tumor-promoting actions of some TLRs may open up new
possibilities for primary or secondary tumor prevention. The fact that TLRs may also
promote chronic inflammation and cancer in some settings should not deter from successes
with TLR agonists as anti-tumor therapy, and requires further mechanistic investigations
shedding light on the “Yin and Yang” of TLRs in tumor biology.

Figure 1. Toll-like receptor signaling

TLRs bind bacterial and viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to
the activation of proinflammatory and anti-viral signaling pathways including NF-κB and
IRF3/IRF7, respectively. Activation of these pathways is mediated by two key adaptor
molecules MyD88 and Trif. Key biological effects of NF-κB activation include prevention
of apoptosis and increased inflammation. Type I interferon induces anti-viral and anti-tumor
immunity.

Figure 2. Yin and Yang of TLRs in tumor biology

Potent activation of TLRs, in particular TLR3, TLR5, TLR7/8 and TLR9 may achieve antitumor effects by converting immune tolerance into anti-tumor immunity. High level TLR
activation induces activation of dendritic cells (DC), which in turn activate key effect cells
including natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in a type I interferondependent manner. Moreover, DC themselves may also aquire cytotoxic and tumoricidal
abilities. In addition, TRL-activated DC also inhibit Treg through IL-6 and angiogenesis
through type I interferon. On the other hand, chronic low-grade stimulation of TLRs, in
particular TLR2 and TLR4, leads to tumor-promoting inflammation and prevention of tumor
apoptosis. This may be mediated through effects on tumor-associated macrophages (TAM),
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) or through direct effects in the tumor. NF-κB activation
play as key role as it not only fuels inflammation but also prevent apoptosis. Finally, tumorsecreted factors, such as versican, may activate TLRs on cells of the tumor
microevironment, further fueling tumor-promoting inflammatory signals.
