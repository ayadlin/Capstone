Abstract
Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–
mutant non–small cell lung cancer derive significant clinical
benefit from treatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Secondary EGFR mutations
such as EGFR T790M commonly lead to resistance to these
agents, limiting their long-term efficacy. Irreversible EGFR
inhibitors such as CL-387,785 can overcome resistance and
are in clinical development, yet acquired resistance against
these agents is anticipated. We carried out a cell-based,
in vitro random mutagenesis screen to identify EGFR mutations that confer resistance to CL-387,785 using T790Mmutant H1975 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mutations at
several residues occurred repeatedly leading to functional
resistance to CL-387,785. These variants showed uninhibited
cell growth, reduced apoptosis, and persistent EGFR activation in the presence of CL-387,785 as compared with parental H1975 cells, thus confirming their role in resistance.
A screen of alternative agents showed that both an alternative EGFR inhibitor and a cyclin-dependent kinase 4
inhibitor led to significant inhibition of cell growth of the
resistant mutants, suggestive of potential alternative treatment strategies. These results identify novel mutations
mediating resistance to irreversible EGFR inhibitors and
reveal alternative strategies to overcome or prevent the
development of resistance in EGFR-mutant non–small cell
lung cancers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10417–27]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ATP-competitive
tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib showed success in
the treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancers following
the failure of front-line chemotherapy (1). Approximately 10% to
25% of patients will have a major response to these agents, and
erlotinib treatment leads to an overall survival advantage as
compared with placebo in patients with chemorefractory non–
small cell lung cancer (1). Most responding patients’ tumors harbor
recurrent somatic EGFR mutations (2–4). The most common of the

EGFR mutations, L858R and exon 19 deletions affecting an LRE
amino acid sequence, represent 85% to 90% of all mutations and
are clear-cut predictors of major responses to this class of drugs
(5–8). Whereas some responses are dramatic and durable, ultimately all patients seem to progress on continued EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Secondary EGFR mutations, most
commonly the EGFR T790M mutation, were identified as the
mechanism of resistance to this class of agents (9–11). Resistance
mediated by T790M can be overcome by irreversible EGFR inhibitors such as CL-387,785, HKI-272, and EKB-569 (11–13). Whereas
such inhibitors are in clinical development and early signs of
success have been reported in erlotinib-refractory lung cancers,
it is clear that resistance develops against this class of inhibitors
as well (14). We developed a cell-based random mutagenesis screen
to identify resistance mechanisms to the model irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor CL-387,785 using T790M-mutant H1975 cells.
Clinically relevant imatinib-resistant mutations of BCR-ABL and
KIT almost exclusively occur in the exons encoding the tyrosine
kinase domain (15, 16). Our current model system therefore focused
on the kinase domain of EGFR to identify potentially clinically
relevant resistance mutations. We also pursued further studies
for the identification of alternative treatment strategies to overcome such resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. NIH-H1975 lung adenocarcinoma cells,
which contain mutant EGFR-L858R-T790M (10), were propagated in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL
penicillin. All cells were grown at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2 and were in the logarithmic growth phase at the initiation of all
experiments. CL-387,785, EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4 inhibitor, cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk)-4 inhibitor, LY294002, AG1478, and U0126 were purchased
from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, Inc.). GW583340 was purchased from
Sigma. Erlotinib was obtained from a commercial source. Drugs were
dissolved in DMSO to give a 10 mmol/L stock solution and then stored
at 20jC and the final DMSO concentration in all experiments was <0.1%
in medium.
EGFR mutagenesis, library generation, and drug resistance screen.
The plasmid construct pCDNA 3.1( )-EGFR-L858R-T790M-HA was generated as previously described (9). This construct was further modified by
mutating the GAGACG sequence to GTGACG through site-directed
mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), thereby
destroying one of the two BsmBI sites at position 1,011 (human EGFR,
GeneBank ID NM005228) without changing the amino acid sequence.
A 1,308-bp region of EGFR containing the entire tyrosine kinase domain
of EGFR was amplified by PCR using the primers 5¶-GAATGTCAGCCGAGGCAGGGAATG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TCACGGAACTTTGGGCGACTATCT-3¶
(antisense) in the presence of 50 Amol/L MnCl2, which reduces the fidelity

of Taq and thereby promotes the introduction of errors leading to random
point mutations (17). Subcloning into p-GEM-T Easy vector and sequencing
of individual colonies showed that essentially all of the PCR products
contained mutations, with 50% of the products containing a 1-bp change,
showing the success of the mutagenesis procedure. The pool of amplified
DNA fragments was digested with BsmBI and ClaI, gel purified after
dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase at 37jC for 1 h to avoid
self-ligation, and religated into the backbone pCDNA 3.1( )-EGFR-L858RT790M-HA vector. Parental NIH-H1975 cells were transfected with the
mutagenized libraries by the use of Fugene 6 reagent (Roche). Culture
supernatants were replaced by fresh medium containing 500 Ag/mL
neomycin and 1 Amol/L CL-387,785 after 24 h. Culture medium was
changed every 2 to 3 days with addition of G418 and fresh CL-387,785.
Nearly 1 month later, isolated cell colonies that became visible were picked
and amplified in liquid culture in the presence of both neomycin and
CL-387,785.
Genomic DNA from the neomycin and CL-387,785–resistant cells was
isolated. Relevant regions of the transfected EGFR DNA were recovered
by PCR amplification with the use of primers 5¶-GGTCTGCCATGCCTTGTGCTC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-ATCCATCAGGGCACGGTAGAAGTT-3¶ (antisense) and the PCR products were sequenced to identify the mutations
that may lead to drug resistance. For sequencing, the following primers
were used: primer set 1, 5¶-GGTCTGCCATGCCTTGTGCTC-3¶ (sense) and
5¶-GTGCGCTTCCGAACGATGTA-3¶ (antisense); primer set 2, 5¶-GATGGTGGGGGCCCTCCTCTT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CTTTCTCTTCCGCACCCAGCAGTT-3¶ (antisense); and primer set 3, 5¶-TCCGGGAACACAAAGACAATA-3¶
(sense) 5¶-ATCCATCAGGGCACGGTAGAAGTT-3¶ (antisense). Of note is
that the obtained sequences were plasmid derived because the sequenc-

ing primers spanned several exons; therefore, genomic EGFR would not be
expected to be amplified with the use of these primers. Sequence alignment
and analysis was done with DNASTAR and Mutation SURVEYOR software
(SoftGenetics).
Generation of EGFR mutants. Four of the mutations identified
repeatedly in the isolated clones were regenerated by site-directed
mutagenesis (QuickChange) of the previously listed pCDNA3.1( )-EGFRL858R-T790M-HA plasmid construct. The site of mutations and primers
used for site-directed mutagenesis were L655H, 5¶-GGGGGCCCTCCACTTGCTGCTGG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CCAGCAGCAAGTGGAGGGCCCCC-3¶ (antisense); L658P, 5¶-CCTCCTCTTGCTGCCGGTGGTGGCCCTGG-3¶ (sense)
and 5¶-CCAGGGCCACCACCGGCAGCAAGAGGAGG-3¶ (antisense); H773L,
5¶-GGACAACCCCCTCGTGTG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CACACGAGGGGGTTGTCC-3¶ (antisense); and E931G, 5¶-CCATCCTGGAGAAAGGAGGACGCCTCCCTCAGC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GCTGAGGGAGGCGTCCTCCTTTCTCCAGGATGG-3¶ (antisense). Two of these mutations, E931G and L658P, were
similarly reengineered into the pCDNA3.1( )-EGFR-L858R-HA plasmid
(non-T790M). The proper sequence of all generated constructs was confirmed by resequencing. Transient transfection studies were done using
Cos-7 cells with these reconstructed plasmids. Western blot analyses were
used to confirm the success of transfection with the use of an antihemagglutinin tag antibody.
The irreversible inhibitor CL-387,785 blocks the EGFR kinase enzymatic
function by covalently binding to Cys797 of EGFR (18–21). We generated the
C797S mutation in our pCDNA3.1( )-EGFR-L858R-T790M-HA construct
by site-directed mutagenesis using primers 5¶-GCTCATGCCCTTCGGCTCCCTCCTGGACTATGTCCG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CGGACATAGTCCAGGAGGGAGCCGAAGGGCATGAGC-3¶ (antisense), and then transfected it onto

NOTE: IC50 for H1975 is 0.36 Amol/L CL-387,785. Altogether, 34 resistant clones were examined and sequenced.

NIH-H1975 cells. G418 (500 Ag/mL) was used to select stably transfected
cells and isolated colonies were picked using cloning rings and continued to
be cultured in the presence of G418. Sequencing was done to confirm the
presence of the mutant C797S DNA in the cells with the primers as listed
earlier. Expression of the EGFR-C797S mutant was confirmed by the detection of the expression of the hemagglutinin tag as above.
Protein immunoblotting. Cells were serum starved overnight and
then incubated with various concentrations of different EGFR inhibitors for
3 h or Cdk4 inhibitor for 24 h before EGF (100 ng/mL; Sigma) stimulation
(37jC, 15 min). After treatment, cells were lysed with 10% TCA lysis buffer
and lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by 7.5%
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for
Western blot analysis. Antibodies to EGFR (SC-3), anti-EGFR-phycoerythrin,
and hemagglutinin tag were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Antibodies directed against phosphorylated EGFR (pY1068), total extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylated ERK, and total Akt
and phosphorylated Akt, and Rb (Ser780, Ser795, Ser807/811) Antibody Kit were
purchased from Cell Signaling. The h-actin antibody was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. After washing and incubation with secondary antibodies,
blots were developed with a chemiluminescence system (Perkin-Elmer).
Cell viability assay to determine IC50. NIH-1975 cells (6  103) and its
subclones expressing tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant mutant EGFR
proteins were plated in each well of 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing
10% FBS. The following day, dilutions of compound were added to the
media in increasing concentrations ( final concentration: 0, 0.2, 0.6, 2.0, 6.0,
and 20 Amol/L). The concentration of DMSO in the medium was adjusted to
0.1%. After 72 h of incubation, viable cell numbers were measured by using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS; absorption of formazan at 490 nm;
CellTiter96, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each assay
consisted of six replicate wells of the same drug concentration. The IC50
was determined from the dose-response curve.
Apoptosis analysis. Parental NIH-H1975 cells and CL-387,785–resistant
H1975 clones were plated at a density of 3  105 per well in six-well plates.
Twenty-four hours after plating, cell culture medium was replaced by fresh
medium containing 10% FBS with or without 1 or 2 Amol/L of CL-387,785 or
EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4 inhibitor, and incubated for another 48 h. Apoptosis
was assessed with the Annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer.

Cell cycle analysis. Cells were incubated with Cdk4 inhibitor (0–6 Amol/L)
in six-well plates for 24 and 72 h before collection. Cells were pulse labeled
for 45 min with 10 Amol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; BD PharMingen,
BD Biosciences), collected by trypsinization, washed, fixed, and stained
with anti-bromodeoxyuridine-FITC conjugates (BD Biosciences), then counterstained with 7-amino-actinomycin D and analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACSort; BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using WINMDI software.
Structural analysis. The crystal structures of the kinase domain were
downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1M14, 1M17,
1XKK, 2GS2, 2GS6, and 2GS7; refs. 22–24) and the structures analyzed using
the program O (25).

Results
Random mutagenesis strategy for the identification of EGFR
mutations conferring resistance to CL-387,785. To generate a
library of point mutants of the EGFR tyrosine kinase binding
domain, we randomly mutagenized a pCDNA 3.1( )-EGFR-L858RT790M-HA plasmid construct using PCR conditions of reduced Taq
polymerase fidelity (Fig. 1). Following digestion with BsmBI and
ClaI, we religated a 1,308-bp region spanning the entire tyrosine
kinase domain of the mutated plasmid pool back into the original
plasmid backbone. Parental H1975 cells were then transfected with
this plasmid pool and subsequently selected for colony growth in
the presence of both 500 Ag/mL G418 and 1 Amol/L CL-387,785
to identify transformation-competent and drug-resistant variants.
H1975 cells carry double-mutant EGFR-L858R-T790M (10) and
were previously shown to be resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib
(IC50 >10 Amol/L) but sensitive to CL-387,785 (IC50, 0.36 Amol/L;
ref. 12). Because growth curves and MTS assays showed that at
1 Amol/L CL-387,785 there is complete and sustained proliferation
arrest of H1975 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1), this concentration
was used for these studies. Thirty days after transfection, wellseparated individual colonies were plucked with the use of cloning
rings and 31 clones were successfully expanded. Limiting dilution
was used as a second selection strategy and three colonies identified through this selection were further expanded.

L655H, H773L, and L656S) detected by flow cytometry through staining with EGFR-phycoerythrin (PE) antibody. The overlay histogram shows representative
histograms of control H1975, L658P, and a nonmutant clone. B, dose-dependent growth inhibition of H1975 cells expressing different mutant and nonmutant clones
as detected by the MTS assay.

From the expanded colonies, genomic DNA was isolated and the
entire mutated kinase domain region of the EGFR gene was
amplified by PCR. The resultant PCR products were bidirectionally
sequenced to identify mutations. Sequence analysis revealed
several previously undescribed point mutations. From 34 drugresistant colonies (31 from the first and 3 from the second selection
strategy), we identified 29 distinct amino acid substitutions
affecting 14 residues (Table 1). Substitutions at six positions were
identified more than once: E931G (8 cases), L658P (4 cases), L655H
(3 cases), H773L (2 cases), Q684R (2 cases), and E545G (2 cases).
From the first selection strategy, 12 colonies contained only wildtype EGFR sequences (one of these had a silent basepair change at
K713), 13 clones contained a single EGFR mutation, and 6 clones
contained double mutations (E545G/M793T, R533W/L658P, E931G/
H773L, G649R/K929E, and E931G/Q684R twice). All of the three
resistant clones identified through our limiting dilution strategy
contained sequence alterations: one clone contained two mutations, T629A and T725S, and a silent basepair change at position
I891, whereas the other two contained a single mutation each
(clone 2, L655H; clone 3, L656S). Interestingly, the L655H mutation
was identified in both selection strategies. The fact that several
mutations were repeatedly identified strongly suggested a functional role for the identified mutations.
Characterization of the identified EGFR mutants. To preclude that drug resistance could be mediated by altered expression of EGFR, we examined cell-surface EGFR expression by flow
cytometry in multiple identified colonies including five with
detected mutations (L658P, E931G, L655H, H773L, and L656S) as
well as four without detectable mutations. There was no difference
in EGFR expression between parental H1975 cells and mutant
H1975 colonies, whereas significantly higher expression of EGFR
was noted in all nonmutant, drug-resistant colonies examined
(Fig. 2A). This suggests that in these nonmutant colonies, resistance to CL-387,785 might be mediated by higher overall expression of EGFR.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

To verify the functional relevance of the isolated EGFR variants,
we studied H1975 clones stably expressing four of the frequently
encountered mutations (E931G, H773L, L658P, and L655H). We
also generated stably transfected H1975 cell lines expressing
pCDNA3.1( )-EGFR-L858R-T790M-C797S-HA plasmid constructs
to model resistance as a result of this hypothesized resistance
mutation that abrogates covalent binding of irreversible EGFR
inhibitors such as CL-387,785 (18, 21). We confirmed equivalent
expression of the transfected EGFR protein by detecting uniform
expression of the hemagglutinin tag in these stable cell lines
(Fig. 2C). We assessed the level of resistance that each of the
identified mutations conferred to CL-387,785 by generating doseresponse curves of each cell line by MTS assays. Cells were cultured
in the presence of increasing concentrations of CL-387,785 ranging from 0 to 20 Amol/L. Parental H1975 cells were potently inhibited by CL-387,785 (IC50, 0.36 Amol/L) as previously reported (12).
H1975 cells expressing mutant EGFR forms were less sensitive to
CL-387,785 with IC50s ranging from 1.12 to 6.70 Amol/L. Two of the
nonmutant clones were also examined and were similarly found to
have increased IC50s of 1.21 and 4.29 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Immunoblot analyses on protein lysates of H1975 cells incubated
with increasing doses of CL-387,785 were also done to examine the
effect of the drug on the phosphorylation of EGFR and its main
downstream signaling effectors, AKT and ERK. In parental H1975
cells, 1 Amol/L CL-387,785 completely inhibited phosphorylation
of EGFR and all of its examined downstream signaling effectors
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, all the variants showed persistent EGFR
phosphorylation in the presence of CL-387,785 at concentrations
ranging from 1 to 3 Amol/L, confirming an f3- to 10-fold shift in
drug sensitivity corresponding to the findings of the MTS assays.
Similarly, both ERK and AKT phosphorylation persisted at higher
drug concentrations than in parental H1975 cells whereas total
levels of EGFR, ERK, and AKT remained unchanged.
Next, all four mutations (E931G, H773L, L658P, and L655H) were
regenerated by site-directed mutagenesis and used for transient

Figure 3. Structural analysis of the EGFR kinase domain mutations. The EGFR kinase domain crystal structure (PDB accession code 2GS6) is shown in complex with
an ATP analogue-peptide conjugate. Two kinase domains are depicted here to illustrate the Cdk/cyclin-like activating asymmetrical dimerization interface elegantly
proposed by Zhang et al. (24). The two EGFR kinase domain molecules are shown in cartoon format and colored blue and brown with their activation loops colored
orange. The kinase domain mutations identified in this study are indicated with space-filling spheres and are colored with oxygen atoms in red and nitrogen atoms in
blue. The locations of activating mutation L858R and the resistance mutation T790M are indicated with red spheres. The ATP analogue-peptide conjugate solved in this
crystal structure is indicated with the ATP moiety shown in stick format and colored according to atom type. The top exploded view shows the location of residues E931
and K929 in the intermolecular interface packed against the surface (in gray ) of the partner kinase domain. The bottom exploded view shows the location of the
mutations found in the vicinity of the ATP-binding pocket. The figure was prepared using the program PYMOL (http://www.pymol.org).

transfection studies in Cos-7 cells. Expression of the mutant EGFRs
was confirmed by detection of the hemagglutinin-tagged EGFR.
Immunoblotting studies to detect phospho- and total EGFR, AKT,
and ERK expression levels were then done with varying concentrations of CL-387,785 in the presence of EGF stimulation. These
transfection studies confirmed resistance to CL-387,785 similar to
the findings in H1975 stable transfectants (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We further analyzed the functional consequences of these
mutations by assessing cellular apoptosis induced by CL-387,785
as defined by Annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assays. Treatment of NIH-H1975 cells with 1 and 2 Amol/L of CL-387,785 resulted in a concentration-dependent prominent increase in the
percentage of apoptotic cells, whereas the same concentrations
had essentially no effect on apoptosis in any of the five mutant
H1975 cell clones examined (Fig. 2D).
Next, we regenerated two of these mutant forms, E931G and
L658P, in a EGFR-L858R-HA background to test whether these
mutations confer resistance to reversible inhibitors such as erlotinib. Transient transfection studies of Cos-7 cells with these constructs showed an f3-fold shift of the IC50 of these two mutant
forms versus the parental plasmid, suggestive of functional resistance against reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Structural analysis of the identified EGFR mutations. There
are now multiple published EGFR kinase domain crystal structures
(22–24, 26, 27). We mapped the three-dimensional locations of the
residues affected by the point mutations onto these solved crystal

structures of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (Fig. 3). Of the four
mutations that were further tested in this study, E931G, L658P,
L655H, and H773L, two occur in the kinase domain. Mutation
E931G occurs in a residue proximal to the proposed dimerization
activation interface (24). In the EGFR crystal structures, E931 can
form an intermolecular salt bridge with K708; however, E931 is not
completely buried in the dimerization interface. Residue H773 is
located in the loop between helix aC and strand h4. This residue
forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of V851
and is above 10 Å distal from the kinase catalytic cleft. Both the
L655H and L658P mutations occur outside of the solved EGFR
kinase domain crystal structures; however, sequence analysis
suggests that these residues are located in a conserved stretch of
leucines that is part of the receptor single-pass transmembrane
helix. For the mutations that were not further tested in this study,
four occur in domain IV of the extracellular region (R533W, E545G,
Y626H, and T629A), two occur in the transmembrane helix (G649R
and L656S), and one occurs in the juxtamembrane region (Q684R).
The remaining mutations are located in the kinase domain, two in
close proximity to the adenosine pocket of the catalytic cleft
(T725S and M793T) and one adjacent to the frequently seen E931G
mutation (K929E).
An alternative EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance.
Next, we tested the above examined five CL-387,785–resistant H1975
clones against a panel of EGFR inhibitors including AG1478 (reversible EGFR inhibitor), GW583340 (reversible EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor),
and an irreversible EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4 inhibitor (Calbiochem).

Resistance to EGFR Inhibitor Therapy in Lung Cancer

We carried out standard MTS assays following 72 h of drug
treatment using a range of concentrations from 0 to 20 Amol/L.
Whereas all mutant clones showed high-level resistance to AG1478
and GW583340 (data not shown), the EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4 inhibitor (chemical structure shown in Supplementary Fig. S4) showed
varying degrees of maintained efficacy against all the mutant clones
tested (Fig. 4A). As compared with parental H1975 cells, this
inhibitor was as effective against L655H and only slightly less
effective against C797S and H773L mutant cells. Whereas a higher
level of resistance was noted against L658P and E931G cells, the
drug concentrations required to overcome resistance still suggest
potential clinical relevance. Signaling studies also showed that
treatment with the EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4 inhibitor can potently inhibit EGFR Y-1068 phosphorylation as well as downstream signaling
correlates such as phospho-AKT and ERK (Fig. 4B). Annexin/
propidium iodide studies further showed the induction of apoptosis by this compound in both parental H1975 cells and all five
clones (E931G, L665H, L658P, H773L, and C797S) examined (Fig. 4C
and D).
Downstream signaling inhibition identifies the use of Cdk4
inhibitors as a potential treatment strategy. We further sought
to determine whether inhibition of downstream signaling pathways
might also be a potentially effective treatment strategy. We were
particularly interested in studying the effect of inhibition of the
cyclin D/Cdk4 axis because our prior studies showed the functional
significance of this pathway in oncogenic EGFR signaling (28).
Therefore, we focused our studies on the potential efficacy of Cdk4
inhibition. The Cdk4 inhibitor used in these studies showed
uniform activity against both parental H1975 cells and all five
mutant clones tested in BrdUrd proliferation studies. Consistent
with the effects on retinoblastoma (Rb) dephosphorylation, the
Cdk4 inhibitor drug blocked cell cycle progression, resulting in a
sharp decrease in the number of cells in the S phase of the cell
cycle at a concentration of 2 Amol/L (Fig. 5A and B). An increased
number of cells in the sub-G1 fraction at 72 h of drug treatment
was also observed in all clones examined, consistent with the
induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5A and B). Immunoblotting showed
that Cdk4 inhibitor treatment resulted in dephosphorylation
of Rb protein at Ser780, Ser795, and Ser807/811 in all mutants, consistent with inhibition of cyclin D/Cdk4 (Fig. 5C). Dephosphorylation occurred at drug concentrations (0.6–2 Amol/L) where the
induction of growth arrest was also observed. These results suggest
that blockade of the cyclin D/Cdk4 axis could be a potential alternative target in EGFR-mutant cells.

Discussion
In our current study, we show the functional relevance of
secondary EGFR mutations as potential resistance mechanisms
against irreversible EGFR inhibitors, modeled by CL-387,785, in
EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer. Our cell-based random
mutagenesis approach identified numerous secondary mutations
of EGFR. Several of these mutations were repeatedly identified,
strongly suggestive of their functional relevance. Four of these
mutants were chosen for further studies, and all four were confirmed to lead to functional resistance to CL-387,785. The IC50 of
these mutants ranged from 1.1 to 6.7 Amol/L (3–19-fold resistance
over parental cells). Because many imatinib-resistant mutations
of BCR-ABL as well as the recently identified D761Y mutation of
EGFR lead to an IC50 shift in this range, we predict that these
mutations will be clinically relevant (15, 29, 30).

www.aacrjournals.org

The mutations described in our study broadly fall into four categories: kinase domain mutations close to the activating interface,
mutations in the kinase domain close to the adenosine binding
region of the catalytic cleft, mutations within the transmembrane
helix, and extracellular mutations. Approximately half of the
mutations that we discovered were in the kinase domain of EGFR
and were dominated by E931G. This mutation was recovered in
eight independent clones and the nearby mutation K929E occurred
in one further clone. Both E931 and K929 are conserved residues
located on the periphery of the proposed kinase-activating asymmetrical dimer interface in the kinase domain crystal structures.
Indeed, in the study of Zhang et al. (24), both K929 and E931 were
predicted to be important in the activation of the cyclin/Cdk-like
asymmetrical EGFR dimer, suggesting that these mutations could
potentially affect the dimerization and activation potential of
EGFR. It is interesting to note that the double mutation E931G +
Q684R arose twice in this study; the mutation Q684R is in the EGFR
juxtamembrane region. This may suggest a role in regulation and
resistance for an interaction between the juxtamembrane region
and the C-lobe of the EGFR kinase domain. Our structural analysis
also suggested that many of the mutations may have an effect
on the kinase catalytic cleft. Mutation H773L occurs at a residue
position dominated by histidine and asparagine residues in human
kinases. These residues are able to form hydrogen bonds; in the
EGFR kinase domain crystal structures, H773 bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of V851. Mutation of histidine to leucine here
may disrupt the local conformation of this loop and influence
the catalytic cleft. The other mutations that occur proximal to the
kinase catalytic cleft, M793T and T725S, are also close to the
adenosine-binding region, with M793T occurring in the kinase
hinge segment and T725S in the glycine-rich nucleotide-binding
loop. The recent study of Yun et al. (26) illustrates the effects of
EGFR point mutations on inhibitor and ATP binding; it is possible
that, similar to the Yun study, alterations in the relative kinetics for
ATP and CL-387,785 could also play a role in resistance. The
transmembrane helix mutations G649R, L655H, L656S, and L658P
are intriguing. Previous work has shown that the transmembrane
region of EGFR self-associates in cell membranes (31) and that
disulfide-induced helix rotation can induce kinase activity (32).
Helix rotation was also seen on binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors to the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the protein (32). The
discovery of these resistance mutations supports the role of the
transmembrane helix in EGFR activation and raises the possibility
that a distortion in the interface can interfere with kinase inhibition
by certain ATP-competitive inhibitors. The mechanism by which
this occurs will need to be further investigated. Interestingly, the
originally described oncogenic rat ErbB2 mutation V664E (33) seems
to be similar to these transmembrane helix mutations.
It is not clear how the four extracellular domain IV mutations
cause resistance to CL-387,785, although expression levels may play
a role. Of note, several of these were found as part of double
mutant clones, potentially suggesting that some of these might be
‘‘carrier’’ mutations without functional relevance. The EGFR
expression level of two of the mutants (Y626H and E545G) was
examined and indeed was as high as in nonmutant, high-EGFR
colonies (data not shown), suggesting that these mutations might
be ‘‘silent’’ and altered expression levels might explain resistance.
Whether these mutations affect EGFR expression per se is not yet
clear. Irreversible inhibitors covalently bind to C797 of the protein
through their Michael acceptor functional group (18, 19, 21). In our
studies, this mutation leads to relatively low-level resistance,

potentially explaining why this mutant was not recovered. In non–
small cell lung cancer cells, EGFR mutations are often linked with
amplification of the EGFR gene. It currently remains unknown
whether EGFR amplification leads to resistance against EGFR
inhibitors; nonetheless, this mechanism is suggested by our finding
that CL-387,785–resistant, transfected H1975 cells without a
detectable mutation consistently express EGFR at a higher level
as compared with their mutant counterparts or parental H1975
cells. This suggests that similar resistance mechanisms also exist
in vivo in EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer. In the study of
Balak et al. (29), one patient was indeed identified with a significant
increase in EGFR gene copy number after EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapy. Whether the mutations identified in our study

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

lead to functional resistance against other irreversible EGFR
inhibitors, such as HKI-272 and EKB-569, will need to be defined
individually. At the same time, we believe our model should provide
a fair sample of potential resistance mechanisms to be encountered
and should also be readily applicable for future studies of EGFR
inhibitors. Of note is that our model system focuses on reactivation
of EGFR signaling as the mechanism of resistance and therefore is
not expected to identify alternative mechanisms, such as the
recently described MET amplification (34).
Our studies suggest that tertiary resistance against such
inhibitors can be overcome by alternative EGFR inhibitors. Here
we used an irreversible pyrido(3,4)-pyrimidine pan-ErbB inhibitor
that has nanomolar potency against EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4. This

compound has previously showed great selectivity for EGFR family
members over other receptors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor,
fibroblast growth factor, and insulin receptors; ref. 35). This drug
showed high-level efficacy against L655H and was only slightly less
effective against the C797S and H773L mutants. L658P and E931G
cells were more resistant to this compound but the concentrations
required to overcome resistance still suggest clinical usefulness.
Whether its differential effect is due its higher potency overall or
is dependent on its slight structural difference from CL-387,785
will need to be further investigated. This inhibitor, similar to
CL-387,785 and other irreversible ErbB inhibitors, is thought to
covalently bind to C797 of EGFR. However, the mechanism by
which this inhibitor is able to sustain efficacy against the C797S
mutation is unclear and may suggest that kinase inhibition does
not depend on covalent binding. Clearly, further studies and
crystallographic analysis are required and may provide insights
such as the Cl-D855 halogen bond seen for gefitinib bound to
L858R mutant EGFR (26). The EGFR inhibitor used in our study
is multitargeted and blocks the activity of both ErbB2 and ErbB4.
Our interpretation of EGFR blockade as its main mechanism of

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibition is supported by our use of the dual EGFR/ErbB2
inhibitor GW583340 that showed no efficacy and signaling studies
showing blockade of EGFR activation by this compound on EGF
stimulation.
We previously showed that cyclin D1 and downstream regulation
of E2F activation are a critical downstream pathway in oncogenic
EGFR signaling, suggestive of the therapeutic potential of the cyclin
D/Cdk axis (28). In our current studies, we used a selective ATPcompetitive Cdk inhibitor (36). This compound in our studies led to
S-phase depletion and inhibition of phosphorylation at Cdk phosphorylation sites of Rb in both wild-type H1975 cells and all EGFRresistant mutant cells tested, consistent with Cdk inhibition. Our
current studies further corroborate the importance of the cyclin
D/Cdk axis and suggest potential therapeutic benefit in patients
with EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer. It will be important
to identify whether more potent inhibitors, such as the EGFR
inhibitor used in our current studies or combinations of inhibitors
(e.g., combined EGFR plus Cdk4 inhibitors), might synergize and
thereby prevent or delay the emergence of resistance. Our in vitro
model system should allow the testing of these concepts.
