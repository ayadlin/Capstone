BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may progress to blast phase (BP) at the rate of 1% to 1.5% per year. With the use of
single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, median overall survival ranges between 7 and 11 months. METHODS: The outcome was analyzed for 42 patients with lymphoid BP-CML who were treated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin,
dexamethasone (HCVAD) plus imatinib or dasatinib. RESULTS: Complete hematological response was achieved in 90% of patients,
complete cytogenetic remission in 58%, and complete molecular remission in 25%. Flow cytometry minimal residual disease negativity
was achieved by 42% of evaluable patients after induction. Eighteen patients received allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) while in
first complete hematological response. Median remission duration was 14 months and was longer among SCT recipients (P 5.01) on
multivariate analysis. Median overall survival was 17 months (range, 7-27 months) and was longer among SCT recipients (P <.001) and
patients treated with dasatinib (P 5.07) on multivariate analysis. Although a high rate of hematologic toxicity (100%) and infectious
complications (59%) were observed, the related rate of treatment discontinuation was low (7% and 9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
HCVAD combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an effective regimen for the management of BP-CML, particularly when followed

INTRODUCTION
Blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (BP-CML) is defined by the presence of more than 30% blasts in the peripheral
blood or the bone marrow or by the presence of extramedullary disease.1 More recently, the World Health Organization
has proposed a blast count of 20% to define BP-CML.2 CML progresses to advanced phase at the rate of 1% to 1.5% per
year.3 Very rarely BP-CML may present without a recognized antecedent chronic phase (CP). The myeloid blast phase
occurs in 50% to 60% of cases of BP-CML, whereas lymphoid blast phase is seen in approximately 20% to 30% of cases;
15% to 20% of cases have an undifferentiated phenotype. Up to 80% of patients affected by BP-CML show additional
cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs).4
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in BP-CML although, when used by themselves, responses are usually short-lived.5 Imatinib, used at the dose of 600 mg, induced complete hematological remission
(CHR) in 31% of patients and complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) in 10%. The median overall survival (OS) was
7 months, with no differences in outcome by immunophenotypic subtype.6 Dasatinib, used at a dose of 70 mg twice daily,
induced CHR in 35% of patients and CCyR in 26% (up to 46% in the lymphoid variant). However, median OS was only
8 months (longer in the myeloid subtype).7 In view of the short remission duration, allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)
has been used in first remission to improve outcome.8
The transient nature of BP-CML response to TKIs is likely the result of the complex molecular milieu of BP-CML.
Moreover, even in CP, the earliest hematopoietic progenitors are not eliminated by TKIs, a fact that likely contributes to
the recurrence of the disease.9 To overcome this, TKIs have been combined with chemotherapy in the advanced stages,
with mixed results.10-15 In this study, we analyzed the outcome of patients with lymphoid BP-CML treated with a standard acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy regimen combined with imatinib or dasatinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Eligibility Criteria

All patients 15 years of age or older with lymphoid
BP-CML who received therapy with hyperfractionated
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate
and cytarabine (HCVAD) plus imatinib or dasatinib at
MD Anderson Cancer Center, whether as initial therapy
or as salvage treatment, were included in this analysis.
BP-CML was defined by the presence of  30% blasts in
the peripheral blood or the bone marrow or by the presence of extramedullary disease. Patients diagnosed with
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph1) ALL were
excluded from this analysis. Pregnant and nursing women
were excluded, and those of childbearing potential were
required to practice effective methods of contraception.
All patients signed an informed consent prior to the start
of therapy. Patients were included in studies approved by
the Institutional Review Board of MD Anderson Cancer
Center and conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Treatment and Monitoring

HCVAD was administered as previously described. The
odd courses (cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7) consisted of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 administered intravenously (iv) over
3 hours every 12 hours for 6 doses on days 1, 2, and 3;
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 iv over 24 hours on day 4; vincristine 2 mg iv on days 1 and 11; dexamethasone 40 mg iv or
orally (po) daily on days 1 to 4 and 11 to 14; methotrexate
(MTX) 12 mg intrathecally on day 2 and cytarabine
(araC) 100 mg intrathecally on day 7. Even courses (cycles
2, 4, 6, and 8) consisted of: MTX 200 mg/m2 iv over
2 hours followed by 800 mg/m2 over 22 hours on day 1;
solumedrol 40 mg iv over 2 hours every 12 hours for
6 doses on days 1 to 3; cytarabine 3 g/m2 iv over 2 hours
every 12 hours for 4 doses on days 2 and 3; filgrastim 10
lg/kg/day was given until neutrophil recovery (to 1 3
109/L). Maintenance consisted of vincristine 2 mg iv on
day 1 every 28 days and prednisone 200 mg po on days 1
through 5 every 28 days and continued for 24 months.
Imatinib was administered at a starting daily dose of
400 mg in 3 patients, 600 mg in 23 patients, and 800 mg
in 1 patient. The starting daily dose of dasatinib was 50
mg (2 patients), 70 mg (2 patients), 100 mg (9 patients),
or 140 mg (2 patients). Both imatinib and dasatinib were
administered from day 1 to day 14 during the first cycle
and continuously during the following cycles, unless
unacceptable toxicity emerged. During maintenance,
imatinib was administered at the dose of 800 mg orally
374

daily and dasatinib at the dose of 100 mg orally daily, as
tolerated. Toxicities were recorded according to Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Before the start of therapy, all patients had a complete history and physical examination, a complete blood
count, a comprehensive biochemistry panel, and a bone
marrow (BM) aspiration with flow cytometry (FC),
cytogenetics, and real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis for BCR-ABL transcript. BM for FC
and/or cytogenetics and RT-PCR analyses were collected
at least every 3 months for the first 12 months of therapy
and at least every 6 months thereafter while on therapy.
Patients were followed for progression and survival at least
every 3 months.
CHR was defined as < 5% blasts in the BM with
peripheral blood neutrophils  1 3 109/L and platelets
 100 3 109/L. CCyR was defined as absence of Ph1
metaphases by conventional cytogenetic analysis in 20
metaphases. Major molecular response was defined as
BCR-ABL transcripts  0.1% in the international scale,
and complete molecular response (CMR) as the absence
of detectable BCR-ABL transcript with a minimum sensitivity of at least 5-logs.
FC Analyses, Cytogenetics, and Quantitative
RT-PCR

Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment by FC was
performed on whole BM specimens using a standard
stain-lyse-wash procedure. Cells (1 3 106) were stained
per analysis tube, and data were acquired on at least 2 3
105 cells when specimen quality permitted. Specimens
were excluded as inadequate if fewer than 5 3 104 cells
were available for analysis. In the first part of the study, a
subset of patients were studied, and data on 4-color staining combinations were acquired on FACSCalibur cytometers using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San
Diego, Calif) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, Ore). Starting in March 2009, patients were
studied more systematically, and data on 6-color stains
were acquired on FACSCanto cytometers using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FCS
Express (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, Calif). Fourcolor combinations contained CD34-FITC or CD34PerCP-Cy5.5 as well as CD19-APC in all tubes, with
additional antigens conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and phycoerythrin (PE) including CD10,
CD13, CD15, CD20, CD22, CD25, CD33, CD38,
CD45, CD58, CD66c, and CD81 (all antibodies from
BD except CD10 from Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
Calif, and CD66c from Immunotech, Marseilles, France).

Six-color combinations included CD34-PerCP-Cy5.5,
CD10-PE-Cy7, and CD19-V450 or later CD19-BV421
in each tube, with the additional antigens listed above
conjugated to FITC, PE, and allophycocyanin (APC).
MRD was identified in comparison with the known patterns of antigen expression by normal maturing CD191
B cells, as described by Weir et al.16 A distinct cluster of at
least 20 cells showing altered antigen expression was
regarded as an aberrant population, yielding a sensitivity
for both 4-color and 6-color assays of 1 in 104 or 0.01%
(for adequate specimens where at least 2 3 105 cells
could be collected). The sensitivity was at least 4 in 104
cells (0.04%) for all specimens. We required aberrant
expression of at least 2 antigens for confirmation of positive MRD.
Cytogenetic analysis was performed by standard
G-banding techniques, and at least 20 metaphases were
analyzed. Marrow specimens were examined on direct
24-hour cultures.
BCR-ABL transcripts were detected by quantitative
RT-PCR analysis on BM aspirate. Following lysis of red
blood cells, RNA was isolated from 10 million to
20 million white blood cells in 100 lL elution volume
using Qiagen’s QIAsymphony extractor (Germantown,
Md) and their QIAsymphony RNA kit. A total of 2.85 lg
of total RNA at 100 ng/lL concentration was then
reverse-transcribed in a 60 lL final volume using Superscript II reverse transcriptase enzyme (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, Calif). Specimen was considered suboptimal if
Cancer

ABL copies were below < 10,000 and BCR-ABL fusion
transcripts were not detected.
Statistical Considerations

Differences between variables were compared by the chisquare test and Mann-Whitney U test for categorical and
noncategorical variables, respectively. Remission duration
(RD) was calculated from the time of CHR achievement
until CHR loss. OS was calculated from the time of start
of therapy until death from any cause or last follow-up.
Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared by the log-rank test. Cox regression with a backward and forward stepwise method was
used for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS
Study Group

A total of 42 patients were treated with HCVAD plus
imatinib (n 5 27) or dasatinib (n 5 15) between 2001
and 2011. The baseline characteristics of the 42 patients
are presented in Table 1. Four patients (10%) had BP as
initial manifestation of CML. Thirty-eight (90%) of the
42 patients had a previous CP of CML and had received a
median of 1 (range, 1-5) different prior treatments. Thirty
(71%) patients had received prior therapy for CP with
TKIs (including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib).
Other prior therapies included interferon alone in 8
patients, or in combination with cytarabine in 8 patients.
Five patients had received prior therapy for BP, including

single agent imatinib (n 5 3), single-agent dasatinib
(n 5 1), and allogeneic SCT (n 5 1). Eight of 17
patients assessed for ABL kinase domain mutations had a
detectable mutation at the time of BP, namely Y253H,
T315I, Q252H, F317L, E255K, M244V, M351T,
and Y253H/F359V/E459K (one each). Nineteen of
33 (58%) evaluable patients had ACAs at the start of
therapy besides the Philadelphia chromosome, most frequently abnormalities of chromosome 1 (32%), chromosome 7 (42%), and chromosome 8 (26%). Two patients
had an e1a2 BCR-ABL rearrangement, 17 had a b2a2,
18 had a b3a2, 4 had a coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2,
and 1 had a b3a3 BCR-ABL rearrangement. The median
time from diagnosis of CML to BP was 25 months
(range, 11-39 months).
Response to Treatment

Responses to treatment are reported in Table 2 and
Table 3. CHR was achieved in 38 (90%) patients.
Twenty-nine (69%) patients achieved CHR after 1 cycle
and 9 (21%) patients after 2 or more cycles. Of the
4 patients who did not achieve CHR, 3 (7%) were
primary refractory after 1 or 2 cycles, and one patient
376

interrupted treatment because of an acute vascular event
(stroke) after 1 cycle, not having achieved a CHR.
CCyR was achieved in 24 (57%) patients after a
median of 2 cycles (range, 1-5). At the time CCyR was
achieved, the median BCR-ABL transcript levels were
0.19% (range, 0%-14.8%) and decreased to 0.001%
(range, 0%-91%) after a median of 2 months (1-17
months) (32 patients assessed). Sixteen of 32 (50%)
patients achieved a MMR, after a median of 4 cycles
(range, 1-8) of therapy. Eight of 32 (25%) patients
achieved a CMR, 4 of them after induction. The median
number of cycles to achievement of CMR was 2 (range,
1-5). Flow cytometry data were available for 12 patients
(all previously untreated for BP-CML) and 7 (58%)
became negative at some point for MRD. Five (42%) of
12 patients had undetectable FC MRD after the first
induction cycle.
Eighteen (47%) patients had an allogeneic SCT
while in CHR, 10 (37%) in the imatinib-treated group
and 8 (53%) in the dasatinib-treated group. Among
patients who had not received prior therapy for BPCML (n 5 38), a CHR was achieved in 34 (89%), a
CCyR in 22 (58%) and CMR in 8 of 29 (28%) patients.

HCVAD Plus TKIs in Lymphoid BP-CML/Strati et al

Figure 1. Remission duration (RD). (A) Median RD in 38 patients achieving complete hematological response was 14 months
(range, 1-62 months). (B) Longer RD was associated with stem cell transplant (SCT) (not reached versus 7 months, P 5.01).

Imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib had all been used
as therapy for CP in various patients, whereas only imatinib and dasatinib were used in previous treatment of BP.
Fifteen (36%) patients who received imatinib and 2 (5%)
patients who received dasatinib during the study period
had already received the same TKI previously. Patients
who received on study a previously used TKI had a significantly lower probability of achieving CCyR (35% versus
77%, P 5 .01). However, there was no significant association with the probability of achieving CHR (P 5 .33),
MRD by flow cytometry (P 5 .34), MMR (P 5 .27) or
CMR (P 5 1).
Remission Duration and Overall Survival

After a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 1-134
months), 15 patients have relapsed, including 5 after
SCT. Three of 5 FC MRD-positive patients relapsed,
whereas none of the FC MRD-negative patients did.
Given the limited number of samples evaluable for MRD
by FC, this factor was not included in remission duration
or survival analysis. The median remission duration for
the 38 patients who achieved CHR was 14 months (range,
1-62) (Fig. 1A). On univariate analysis, RD was significantly longer for patients who received a SCT (not
reached versus 7 months, P 5 .01) (Fig. 1B), and for
patients who achieved a CCyR (not reached versus 8
months, P < .015). Although not statistically significant,
there was a trend for a longer RD for patients on dasatinib
Cancer

February 1, 2014

(not reached versus 14 months, P 5 .15) and for patients
receiving on study a TKI not previously used (not reached
versus 14 months, P 5 .09). On multivariate analysis of
meaningful characteristics, the association with RD was
confirmed only for SCT (OR 5 4.3, P 5 .04).
Twenty-six (62%) patients have died. Eighteen
(69%) died due to refractory disease or relapse and 2
(8%) died after SCT while in CHR from nonrelapse
causes. The remaining 6 (23%) patients died while in
CHR, from infectious complications (4 while on treatment, one died 2 months after the last cycle, and one
died 5 years later, after developing therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome). Median OS was 17 months
(range, 7 to 27 months) (Fig. 2A). OS was significantly
better in SCT recipients (median 93 versus 9 months,
P < .001) (Fig. 2B), in patients achieving CCyR (77
versus 9 months, P < .001), in patients with baseline
BM basophils < 1% (23 versus 7 months, P 5 .01), in
patients treated with dasatinib (compared to imatinib)
in association with HCVAD (not reached versus 12
months, P 5 .007) (Fig. 2C), and in patients receiving a
TKI not previously used (59 versus 12 months,
P 5 .009). On multivariate analysis receiving SCT
(odds ratio [OR] 5 10.1, P 5 .02) and treatment with
dasatinib (OR 5 5.8, P 5 .02) were independently
associated with prolonged survival. Of interest, ACAs,
prior use of TKIs and previous therapy for BP were
not significant on univariate analysis for RD or OS.

Treatment Characteristics and Toxicity

The median number of administered cycles was 4 (1-8),
with only 3 patients completing the planned 8 cycles of
therapy. Toxicity was similar to the historical experience
with HCVAD alone or in combination with TKIs in
ALL.17-19 All patients experienced grade (G) 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during treatment, and
88% of them had G3-4 anemia. However, hematological
toxicity prompted treatment discontinuation in only 3
(7%) patients. G3-4 infections were observed in 59% of
patients and prompted treatment discontinuation in 4
(9%) patients. G3-4 hepatotoxicity (elevation in alanine
aminotransferase and/or total bilirubin) was reported in
29% of patients, and G3-4 nephrotoxicity (transient) in
2% of patients. Other reasons for not completing 8 cycles
included: SCT (18 cases), relapse (9 cases), refractoriness
(3 cases, after a median of 2 cycles), stroke (1 case), and
severe diarrhea (1 case). Early death (within 60 days from
the start of therapy) occurred in 4 (9%) patients.
DISCUSSION
Here, we show the efficacy of HCVAD combined with a
TKI for the treatment of lymphoid BP-CML. BP-CML
with a lymphoid phenotype is less common than the myeloid subtype and has unique biological and clinical features. Occasionally, lymphoid BP-CML can occur de
novo (ie, not preceded by a recognized CP).20 This phenomenon was identified in 10% of the patients described
in this series. Differential diagnosis between de novo
lymphoid BP-CML and ALL Ph1 is challenging. The 4
patients in our study with no preceding CP CML had
morphologic features of CML in the BM samples, includ378

ing dwarf megakaryocytes, left-shifted myeloid predominance, eosinophilia, and/or basophilia, which supported
the former diagnosis. For patients with preceding CP,
time from CML to BP was short (25 months), which is in
line with what has been previously reported.2
ACAs are commonly reported in BP-CML. Trisomy
8, additional Ph-chromosome, isochromosome (17q),
and trisomy 19 are called major route ACAs: they are considered relevant for pathogenesis and have a negative
prognostic impact.21 Chromosome 3 aberrations, loss of
the Y-chromosome and other rarer aberrations are less frequent and indicate genetic instability.22-24 In our series,
ACA occurred in 58% of all patients, more frequently
involving chromosome 7 (42%), 1 (32%) and 8 (26%),
and mostly represented by monosomies. Further investigation is warranted in order to clarify the biological significance of these abnormalities and to identify potential
molecular therapeutic targets.
BP represented an inevitable fate for CML in the
pre-imatinib era, with an annual rate of transformation of
20%. Lymphoid BP-CML was treated in the past with
various vincristine-prednisone-based regimens, with disappointing short-lasting remission durations.25,26 TKIs
have dramatically changed the natural history of CML,
with fewer patients transforming to blast phase, at a rate
of 5% to 6% per year in the first 2 to 3 years, and less than
1% per year thereafter. Furthermore, it appears that the
rate of transformation is decreased with the use of second
generation TKI as initial therapy of the disease.27,28 It has
been suggested that Ph1 disease with lymphoid phenotype might have a greater dependence on activation of Src
family of kinase.29 Interestingly, up to 50% of patients

have been reported to achieve a CCyR with single-agent
dasatinib (a Src inhibitor). However, with the use of
single-agent dasatinib (as with imatinib) responses are of
short duration and the median OS of patients affected by
BP-CML has improved only modestly from 3-4 months
to approximately 7 months.30 A major insight into the
biology and molecular mechanisms regulating this entity
is then necessary, in order to identify more effective therapies. BCR-ABL could be responsible for progressive
genomic instability or epigenetic changes occurring in
CML stem cells leading to BP.31 This is indirectly
suggested not only by the higher incidence of BP prior to
the TKI era,32 but also by the correlation between presence of BCR-ABL mutations and clonal evolution.33
Once progressed to BP, the disease becomes more molecularly complex and only partially dependent from BCRABL, thus the need for combination treatment. The combination of chemotherapy plus TKIs has been used extensively in Ph1 ALL. We have previously published on the
combination of HCVAD plus imatinib18 or dasatinib19
in this setting. Twenty (both treated and untreated) Ph1
ALL patients were treated with the HCVAD plus imatinib: CR rate was 100% with a median duration of 20
months; 10 patients underwent transplantation in first
CR and only 1 relapsed thereafter. Thirty-five untreated
Ph1 ALL patients were treated with HCVAD plus dasatinib and CR rate was 93%; with a median follow-up of
14 months, median progression-free survival and OS
were not reached.
There is limited experience in the literature using
TKI-based combinations in lymphoid BP-CML. In our
previous series,14 2 patients with lymphoid BP-CML
were treated with HCVAD plus imatinib and one with
HCVAD plus dasatinib. One patient treated with
HCVAD plus imatinib obtained a CHR lasting
12 months, but the other 2 were refractory. A single case
report was later published showing a progression-free
survival of 19 months for a patient with lymphoid
BP-CML treated with analogous chemotherapy scheme
followed by allogeneic SCT.15 These data highlighted
the potential efficacy of such combination treatment.
In the present report, the first large series of chemotherapy combined with TKI for BP-CML, HCVAD plus
imatinib or dasatinib induced a CHR in 90% of patients
and CCyR in 59%. These results are clearly superior to
what is reported with imatinib or dasatinib as single
agents (CHR rate < 35%).6,7 Despite the use of TKIs
added to chemotherapy, there is no evidence of increased
toxicity compared to what is expected with chemotherapy alone, as reflected by a low rate of early mortality

and a low rate of discontinuations related to cytopenia or
infectious complications.
One of the benefits of an effective therapy in this
setting is the ability to take patients to SCT. In patients
who underwent transplantation, median remission duration has not been reached and OS at 7 years is 61%. Of
interest, in a recent report from the German CML Study
Group, the 3-year survival of 28 patients pretreated with
imatinib-based regimens and transplanted for advancedphase CML (25 with BP-CML) was 59%.8 In our series,
59% of patients achieved CCyR, with a median time to
CCyR of 2 cycles (1-5 cycles). An important consideration is the proper timing for SCT on a patient who has
achieved CHR but not yet CCyR. Although continued
chemotherapy to aim for CCyR may prove beneficial for
the long-term outcome in some patients, others may not
be able to reach a SCT because of relapse or emerging
comorbidities that preclude a transplant. Further studies
are needed to better settle this clinical dilemma. However,
in the absence of additional data and as highlighted by the
results of our multivariate analysis, it might be appropriate to proceed to SCT whenever a patient has reached at
least a CHR if other conditions are optimal for transplant.
As predicted by its use as a single agent,7 the use of
HCVAD plus dasatinib produced an improved OS, with
a trend for improved RD, although the latter did not
achieve statistical significance probably because of the
small sample size. Prospective, randomized trials with a
larger number of patients are needed in order to confirm
any potential superiority compared to imatinib. Given its
association with a higher CCyR rate and OS (although
not confirmed on multivariate analysis), further investigation is also needed in order to establish whether using a
previously employed TKI may affect the efficacy of this
regimen.
In conclusion, HCVAD plus imatinib or dasatinib
is an effective and safe regimen for patients with lymphoid
BP-CML. Better results are achieved combining allogeneic SCT. More extensive prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations.
