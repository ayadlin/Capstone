Abstract
Tumor cells develop drug resistance which leads to recurrence and distant
metastasis. MicroRNAs are key regulators of tumor pathogenesis; however, little is
known whether they can sensitize cells and block metastasis simultaneously. Here,
we report miR-644a as a novel inhibitor of both cell survival and EMT whereby acting
as pleiotropic therapy-sensitizer in breast cancer. We showed that both miR-644a
expression and its gene signature are associated with tumor progression and distant
metastasis-free survival. Mechanistically, miR-644a directly targets the transcriptional
co-repressor C-Terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) whose knock-outs by the CRISPRCas9 system inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, mimicking
the phenotypes induced by miR-644a. Furthermore, downregulation of CTBP1 by
miR-644a upregulates wild type- or mutant-p53 which acts as a ‘molecular switch’
between G1-arrest and apoptosis by inducing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1
(p21, CDKN1A, CIP1) or pro-apoptotic phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
protein 1 (Noxa, PMAIP1), respectively. Interestingly, an increase in mutant-p53
by either overexpression of miR-644a or downregulation of CTBP1 was enough to
shift this balance in favor of apoptosis through upregulation of Noxa. Notably, p53mutant patients, but not p53-wild type ones, with high CTBP1 have a shorter survival
suggesting that CTBP1 could be a potential prognostic factor for breast cancer patients
with p53 mutations. Overall, re-activation of the miR-644a/CTBP1/p53 axis may
represent a new strategy for overcoming both therapy resistance and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

cells undergo epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT),
evade from primary tumor site and metastasize to distant
organs leading to death of the patients [3]. Therefore, it
is necessary to identify novel targets which do not only
inhibit tumor growth, but also sensitize refractory cells to
therapy and prevent metastasis.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 20–22 nucleotide small
non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by preferentially binding to the seed-

matching sequence in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs
leading to either mRNA destabilization or degradation
[4]. miRNAs have been classified as tumor suppressors
or oncogenic ones depending on the phenotype they
induce, the targets they modulate, and the tissue where
they function [5, 6]. In this context, large number of
oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs have been
shown to be associated with cancer progression, drug
resistance or metastasis (reviewed in [7, 8]). However,
little is known about miRNAs that can simultaneously
regulate tumor proliferation and EMT whereby acting as
therapy-sensitizer and metastasis blocker in breast cancer.
In this study, we identify miR-644a as a novel
inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation and metastatic
potential which acts as a pleotropic therapy sensitizer in
breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. These findings are
further supported by the analysis of several breast cancer
datasets. Mechanistically, we show that miR-644a directly
targets transcriptional co-repressor CTBP1 and thereby
upregulates p53 levels. We then show that this increased
wild type or mutant p53 acts as a switch deciding on G1arrest or apoptosis by inducing p21 or Noxa, respectively.
Our in silico analyses propose CTBP1 as an important
predictor for survival of breast cancer patients with p53
mutation. These results suggest that the re-activation of
miR-644a/CTBP1/p53 axis may represent a new target to
overcome breast cancer progression, therapy resistance,
and metastasis.

(Figure 1D and 1E) by inducing G2/M arrest characterized
by increased phosphorylation of G2/M-arrest markers
Cdc2 and Cdc25C (Figure 1F and 1H). In contrast, miR644a overexpression in p53-wt MCF-7 cells resulted in
G1 arrest with decreased expression of G1/S transition
proteins and increased expression of CDK inhibitor p21,
which leads to reduced phosphorylation of Rb protein
(Figure 1G and 1H).
To validate our findings in vivo, we engineered
MDA-MB-231 cell line (referred to herein as 231.Ctrl)
with lentiviral-transduced miR-644a (referred to herein
as 231.miR-644a) (Supplementary Figure S1A), and
observed a delayed and significantly decreased tumor
growth (Figure 1I). Correspondingly, tumors collected
from the 231.miR-644a group showed high levels of miR644a expression (Figure 1L), were substantially smaller
and weighed less (Figure 1J and 1K) further confirming
the tumor suppressive role of miR-644a in breast cancer.
To elucidate the pathological relevance of miR644a, we examined the expression of miR-644a in
publicly available expression datasets GSE45666 and
GSE58606 [14, 15], and observed significantly lower
miR-644a levels in tumors as compared to normal tissues
(Figure 1M and 1N). Besides breast cancer, melanoma and
osteosarcoma cell lines also had lower miR-644a levels
compared to their normal counterparts (Supplementary
Figure S1B and S1C). In addition to gene-level analysis,
we also performed gene expression profiling to derive a
miR-644a signature, and used this signature to elucidate
miR-644a-induced changes in a more global manner. To
this end, we forced expression of miR-644a using mimics
in three breast cancer cell lines representing different
subtypes of breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S2A).
We then collected commonly up- and down-regulated
genes among these three cell lines to create a ‘miR-644a
signature’ (Supplementary Table S1). Gene Ontology
(GO) term analysis revealed association of miR-644a
signature with biological processes contributing to
tumor progression, such as cell cycle, apoptosis,
actin cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Furthermore, Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of GSE58644 dataset [16]
showed a significant correlation between miR-644a gene
signature and tumor progression in breast cancer patients.
Notably a gene set containing genes downregulated in
lobular carcinoma compared to normal lobular breast cells
were enriched in patients with high miR-644a signature
scores (Supplementary Figure S1D). Moreover, genes
associated with histologic grade 1 and grade 3 in breast
cancer patients were significantly enriched in high and
low miR-644a signature scorers, respectively (Figure
1O and Supplementary Figure S1E). Consistent with this
observation, in the same dataset, miR-644a signature
score was lower in tumors with a more aggressive disease
state characterized by higher tumor grade and stage
(Supplementary Figure S1F and S1G). Finally, miR-644a

RESULTS
miR-644a inhibits proliferation, promotes
apoptosis, and its expression or gene signature
correlates with tumor progression in breast
cancer
To identify novel miRNAs regulating proliferation
in breast cancer, we performed a small scale miRNA
mimic cell viability screen entailing 35 miRNAs in MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cell line (Figure 1A). As a
positive control we used miR-200c, which was previously
reported as a tumor suppressor miRNA by us [9] and others
[10, 11]. Out of three most promising potential tumor
suppressor miRNAs besides miR-200c, miR-299–3p and
miR-127–5p have been reported as tumor suppressors in
different cancer types [12, 13]. The other one, miR-644a,
has not been characterized in the context of breast cancer.
Real time cell analyzer (RTCA) assay further confirmed
inhibitory role of miR-644a in viability of MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore, miR-644a reduced viability
of other cell lines representing different breast cancer
subtypes and two normal breast cell lines, MCF-10A
and MCF-12A, (Figure 1C).
Upon miR-644a overexpression, breast cancer
cell lines with p53 mutation (p53-mut) only underwent
apoptosis evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3

status was correlated with the formation and progression
of not only breast cancer, but also of a variety of cancers,
including melanoma, liver, lung and ovarian cancers
(Supplementary Table S2), all supporting the tumor
suppressive roles of miR-644a.

(Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, miR-644a expression
was found to be negatively associated with metastasis
in cancers other than breast as well (Supplementary
Figure S1H and S1I; Supplementary Table S3). Finally,
we showed an enrichment of genes associated with poor
outcome in patients having low miR-644a signature scores
(Figure 2N). Consistent with this, breast cancer patients
with high miR-644a signature scores have significantly
longer distant-metastasis-free survival (Figure 2O).
Overall, our data suggest that miR-644a is a novel tumor
suppressor that is likely to be involved in progression and
metastasis of multiple cancer types including breast cancer.

miR-644a inhibits metastasis and correlates with
distant metastasis-free survival in patients
Since we observed enrichment of biological
processes relevant to metastasis (Supplementary
Table S3), we wanted to examine the effects of miR-644a
on the metastatic potential of breast tumors. Transient or
stable miR-644a overexpression significantly inhibited
migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells as assessed
by wound healing, real-time migration and trans-well
matrigel invasion assays (Figure 2A–2D) and reduced
anchorage independent growth (Figure 2E). Furthermore,
cells overexpressing miR-644a showed rearrangements
of actin cytoskeletal structures from a mesenchymal to an
epithelial-like state (Figure 2F) which is further confirmed
by upregulated epithelial markers and downregulated
mesenchymal markers both at mRNA and protein level
upon miR-644a overexpression (Figure 2G–2I). Further,
we tested the metastatic potential of 231.miR-644a cells in
nude mice with tail-vein metastasis assay. Bouin’s fixation
of lungs and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining
indicated less colonization of 231.miR-644a cells to lungs
as compared to 231.Ctrl cells (Figure 2J and 2K). As these
cells are stably labelled with luciferase, we measured
luciferase activity of lung lysates, and showed that
substantially less number of cells reached metastasized to
the lungs when miR-644a is expressed (Figure 2L). These
data suggest that miR-644a also inhibits metastasis in vivo.
Then, to validate these in vitro and in vivo findings
in human patient datasets, we first examined GSE38167
dataset [17], and found that expression of miR-644a is
lower in primary tumors compared to normal adjacent
tissues, and even further decreased in lymph node
metastases (Figure 2M). This observation was further
validated by GSEA which revealed an enrichment of
genes whose expression in primary tumors of estrogen
receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer positively correlates
with developing distant metastases are enriched in patients
with low miR-644a signature scores from GSE58644

miR-644a is a pleiotropic therapy sensitizer in
breast cancer
Since miR-644a inhibits both breast cancer cell
survival and EMT, we hypothesized that it might also
work as a therapy sensitizer. To test this hypothesis,
we did GSEA with gene sets related to drug sensitivity
and resistance. We observed that genes associated
with doxorubicin (topoisomerase II inhibitor) and
cisplatin (DNA cross linking agent; promising therapy
for BRCA1/2 mutated/deficient tumors) resistance in
gastric cancer cell lines and patients, respectively were
significantly enriched in patients with low miR-644a
signature scores (Supplementary Table S3). Indeed, miR644a significantly sensitized p53-mut MDA-MB-231 and
p53-wt MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin and BRCA1-mutated
MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro
(Figure 3A, 3B and 3D). Furthermore, significantly higher
miR-644a levels were observed in doxorubicin sensitive
tumors developed in vivo as compared to resistant ones
(Figure 3C), further supporting that miR-644a may play a
role in chemotherapy resistance also in vivo.
In addition to chemotherapy agents, we found
that patients with higher miR-644a signature scores
have enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen (Supplementary
Table S3), which is the mainstay targeted therapy for
ER+ breast cancer patients for over 40 years [18].
We demonstrated that forced miR-644a expression
sensitizes cells to tamoxifen in ER+ MCF-7 cells in vitro
(Figure 3E). Similarly, we saw that genes downregulated
in gefitinib resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells
undergoing prominent growth arrest and apoptosis upon

treatment with an irreversible EGFR inhibitor, CL387,785 [19], were enriched in low miR-644a signature
scorers (Supplementary Table S3). We validated this in
EGFR overexpressing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, where
miR-644a overexpression significantly sensitized cells to
gefitinib (Figure 3F). Overall, multiple lines of evidence
support the notion that miR-644a may be a pleiotropic
sensitizer for both chemo- and targeted-therapy.

Inversely, miR-644a inhibition in MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-12A cells by using hairpin inhibitors upregulated
CTBP1 levels (Figure 4G and 4H). We confirmed CTBP1
as a direct target of miR-644a by measuring luciferase
expression from CTBP1 3′-UTR constructs with or
without mutation (Supplementary Figure S3A) in MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon miR-644a transfection.
In both cell lines, miR-644a overexpression significantly
repressed luciferase expression when co-transfected
with Wild type 3′-UTR expressing vector, but not in the
case of mutated 3′-UTR expressing vector (Figure  4I
and 4J). Additionally, through analyzing mRNA and
miRNA expression profile dataset GSE40059 [23], we
observed an inverse correlation between miR-644a and
CTBP1 expression in 11 different breast cancer cell lines
(Figure 4K). Overall, these data confirm that CTBP1 is a
direct target of miR-644a.

CTBP1 is a direct target of miR-644a
To identify the targets of miR-644a mediating
these observed effects, we combined the list of genes
downregulated upon miR-644a overexpression in our
microarray analysis with targets of miR-644a predicted
by three target prediction algorithms. This stringent
analysis resulted in 3 genes: CTBP1, CHMP7, and NDST1
(Figure 4A). We found CTBP1 as the most promising
candidate since it is an established transcriptional corepressor which preferentially represses the transcription
of tumor suppressor genes and promotes tumor growth via
playing pivotal roles in tumor pathogenesis [20–22].
Sequence analysis revealed that human CTBP1
3′-UTR has one binding site of miR-644a between
nucleotides 453–460 (Figure 4B). Transient as well
as stable overexpression of miR-644a significantly
downregulated CTBP1 mRNA and protein levels in
both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Figure 4C–4F).

Loss of CTBP1 mimics tumor- and metastasissuppressive roles of miR-644a in vitro and in vivo
To validate that CTBP1 is a major functional
target of miR-644a, we first knocked down CTBP1
with two different siRNA sequences (Supplementary
Figure S4A and S4B), and examined the effect on
viability, apoptosis and cell cycle. We observed a
significant reduction in the viability of all tested
cell lines upon CTBP1 knockdown (Figure 5A).

Interestingly, CTBP1 downregulation also mimicked
miR-644a overexpression in increasing apoptotic cell
death and inducing cleaved caspase-3 exclusively in
p53-mut breast cancer cell lines, but not in p53-wt cell
lines (Figure 5B and 5C). Moreover, cell cycle and
western blot analysis confirmed a G2/M arrest in p53-mut
MDA-MB-231 cells while a G1 arrest was observed in
p53-wt MCF-7 cells upon CTBP1 knockdown similar to
the effect of miR-644a (Figure 5D and 5E). For in vivo
validation, we generated two independent CRISPRCas9 mediated CTBP1 knock-outs in MDA-MB-231
cells (referred to herein as 231.sgCTBP1_1 and 231.
sgCTBP1_2) (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C). Both

cell lines showed efficient downregulation of CTBP1
(Figure  5F), and exhibited delayed and significantly
decreased tumor growth and tumor size in nude mice
(Figure 5G–5I). We could also replicate these findings
using an shRNA construct against CTBP1 (Supplementary
Figure S5A–S5D).
Next, we tested if the loss of CTBP1 is able to
mimic the effects of miR-644a on tumor metastasis.
CTBP1 knockdown significantly inhibited migration and
invasion of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells
(Figure 5J and 5K), and induced a more epithelial-like
state (Figure 5L–5N). Inversely, CTBP1 upregulation upon
miR-644a inhibitor transfection promoted mesenchymal-

down CTBP1. We observed that knockdown of
CTBP1 sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to doxorubicin
(Figure 6D). Furthermore, rescuing CTBP1 levels along
with miR-644a overexpression (Figure 6E) not only
increased the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6F),
but also rendered these cells less sensitive to doxorubicin
treatment compared to those cells in which only miR644a was overexpressed (Figure 6G). Furthermore,
we observed a significantly lower levels of CTBP1 in
doxorubicin sensitive tumors compared to resistant tumors
of the mouse models we developed (shown in Figure 3C),
which is exactly the opposite of miR-644a levels in these
tumors (Figure 6H). Finally, CTBP1 rescue via miR-644a
inhibitor transfection promoted mesenchymal-like state by
upregulating mesenchymal markers and downregulating
epithelial markers; and this phenotype was reversed upon
CTBP1 knockdown (Figure 6I). Overall, all these data
confirm that CTBP1 is a major functional target of miR644a mediating drug resistance and EMT in breast cancer.

like state (Figure 5O). Furthermore, CTBP1 knock-outs by
sgRNAs or knockdown by shRNA resulted in a significant
reduction in anchorage-independent growth (Figure 5P
and 5Q; Supplementary Figure S5E). Re-analysis of the
GSE2603 dataset [24] revealed that in vivo sub-lines of
MDA-MB-231 with enhanced lung metastatic ability
express substantially higher CTBP1 levels compared
to parental cells with limited lung metastatic potential
(Figure 5R). We then set to test the effect of CTBP1
in lung metastasis, and demonstrated markedly less
colonization of 231.sgCTBP1_1 and 231.sgCTBP1_2 cells
to lungs compared to 231.sgCtrl cells as demonstrated by
Bouin’s fixation and H&E staining of lungs and luciferase
assay with lung lysates (Figure 5S–5U).
To elucidate the role of CTBP1 in tumor progression
and metastasis in breast cancer patients, we analyzed
several patient datasets. In GSE4922 [25] and GSE58644
datasets, CTBP1 levels were found to be correlated with
higher tumor size and incidence of developing distant
metastasis (Supplementary Figure S5F and S5G). Finally,
we retrieved data form the Molecular Taxonomy of
Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC)
project [26], and performed targeted analysis. We found
that Stage 2 and 3 breast cancers where cancer starts to
spread to nearby lymph nodes feature higher CTBP1
levels compared to Stage 1 breast cancer which has no or
only microscopic invasion smaller than 1 mm [27]. There
was also a significant increase in CTBP1 levels in Stage
4 tumors, characterized by the presence of metastases to
organs other than breast (Supplementary Figure S5H). In
accordance with the tumor stage, patients with 20 or more
positive lymph nodes had higher CTBP1 in their primary
tumors suggesting a role of CTBP1 in promoting lymph
node metastasis (Supplementary Figure S5I). All of these
findings suggest that CTBP1 inhibition mimics miR-644a
overexpression in inhibition of breast tumor growth and
metastasis.

miR-644a/CTBP1-mediated wild type or mutant
p53 upregulation acts as a switch deciding on G1
arrest or apoptosis
The in vitro findings that overexpression of miR-644a
or loss of its target CTBP1 induces apoptosis in p53-mut,
but not in p53-wt cells triggered us to investigate the
relationship between miR-644a, CTBP1, and p53 mutation
status. First, we performed an enrichment analysis
for apoptosis-related gene sets on p53-mut vs p53-wt
patients that are expressing high levels of miR-644a from
GSE22220 dataset [31]. We have separated the patients
as p53-wt and p53-mut according to the expression
levels of a gene signature associated with p53 status [32]
(details are given in Material and Methods section and
Supplementary Figures S8 and S9). We observed that
apoptosis genes were significantly enriched in p53-mut
patients compared to p53-wt patients (Figure 7A and 7B).
While investigating the underlying mechanism, we found
that miR-644a overexpression or CTBP1 knockdown
increased the expression of p53 level in both p53-mut
MDA-MB-231 and p53-wt MCF-7 cells (Figure 7C).
Furthermore, in 231.miR-644a cells, p53 level was
reduced upon CTBP1 ORF expression, which shows that
miR-644a mediated upregulation of p53 is via CTBP1
downregulation (Supplementary Figure S6A). Notably,
overexpression of miR-644a or knockdown of CTBP1
in MCF-7 cells did not change p53 mRNA level, which
indicates a possible post-transcriptional regulation of p53
expression (Supplementary Figure S6B and S6C). Overall,
these results show that miR-644a induces p53 expression/
activity in a p53 status-independent manner.
It has been shown that stabilized p53 activates
several genes that induce cell cycle arrest (e.g. p21) and
apoptosis (e.g. Noxa, Bax and Puma) [33]. Furthermore,
CTBP1 knock-out cells were shown to express high levels

CTBP1 is a major functional target of miR-644a
mediating drug resistance and EMT
We tested if CTBP1 mediates the effect of miR644a on drug resistance. In silico analysis of GSE16446
dataset [28–30] showed significantly lower levels of
CTBP1 in patients with pathologic complete response
(pCR) compared to patients without complete response
against anthracycline treatment (Figure 6A). In the same
dataset, low CTBP1 level was associated with better
outcome in terms of distant metastasis-free survival
(DMFS) (Figure 6B). In GSE58644, among patients
treated with chemotherapy, distant metastasis incidence
rate was significantly higher in patients with high CTBP1
(Figure 6C). All these suggest an important role of CTBP1
in tumor recurrence in chemotherapy treated patients.
We then tested if we can mimic the effect of
miR-644a on chemotherapy response by knocking

of pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and Bax [34]. Therefore, we
examined the expression of these in both MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7 cells upon miR-644a overexpression. While
the expression of p21 was only upregulated in p53-wt
MCF-7 cells, Noxa, but neither Bax nor Puma, was
significantly upregulated in p53-mut MDA-MB-231 cells
at mRNA and protein level upon miR-644a transfection
(Figure 7D and 7E; Supplementary Figure S6D and S6E).
Analysis of commonly upregulated genes by wt-p53 in
breast cancer patients from Troester et al. [32] and loss of
CTBP1 in MCF-7 cells from Di et al. [35] also identified
only p21 and BTG2 (data not shown) which further
supported that miR-644a mediated upregulation of wt-p53
and p21 is via CTBP1 downregulation.
We then asked whether we can induce apoptosis
upon miR-644a expression or CTBP1 knockdown
in p53-wt MCF-7 cells if mut-p53 was co-expressed.
After confirming successful overexpression of mut-p53
with western blot (Figure 7F and 7I), we performed
an apoptosis assay followed by qRT-PCR of Noxa.
Overexpression of mut-p53 alone in p53-wt MCF-7 cells
induced a certain level of apoptosis and Noxa expression,
which is further enhanced either by overexpression of
miR-644a or by knockdown of CTBP1 (Figure 7G–7K).
This confirms that miR-644a mediates apoptosis in
the presence of mut-p53 mainly by the pro-apoptotic
gene Noxa. Furthermore, presence of mut-p53 did not
affect downregulation of CTBP1 (Figure 7F and 7I;
Supplementary Figure S6F and S6H) suggesting that there
is no feedback regulation of CTBP1 by p53 in the miR644a/CTBP1/p53 axis. Lastly, to validate that p53 serves
as a switch in miR-644a/CTBP1/p53 axis in breast cancer,
we checked the downstream effects of miR-644a in 6
different breast cancer cell lines (three p53-wt and three
p53-mut) after forced miR-644a expression using mimics.
We demonstrated that depending on the p53 status, miR644a/CTBP1/p53 axis leads to either p21 upregulation (in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

case of p53-wt cells) or Noxa upregulation (in case of p53mut cells) explaining the observed G1 arrest or apoptosis
induction, respectively (Figure 7L).

p53 mutant patients with high CTBP1 level are
predicted to have a worse survival
It has been known that p53-wt patients have
better survival as compared to p53-mut ones [36–38].
We confirmed this by analyzing published patient
data and showed that p53-mut patients survive less
than p53-wt patients (Supplementary Figure S7A
and 7B). Unlike the prognostic relevance of miR644a signature, no correlation of CTBP1 mRNA
levels with the survival of breast cancer patients from
GSE58644 and GSE19536 [39] datasets was found
(Supplementary Figure S7C and S7D). Therefore, we
asked if the expression level of CTBP1 can be associated
with the survival of p53-mut patients in these datasets.
This was indeed the case for both of the datasets as well
as an online survival analysis tool, Kaplan-Meier (KM)
Plotter [40] (Figure 7M–7O). However, in p53-wt patients
CTBP1 expression level did not have any significant effect
on survival of the patients (Supplementary Figure S7E–
S7G). We observed a similar pattern in ovarian cancer
where p53-mut patients with high CTBP1 levels are less
likely to survive compared to patients with low CTBP1
(Figure 7P; Supplementary Figure S7H). Overall, these
data suggest that CTBP1 expression may be associated
with survival of p53-mut breast and ovarian cancer
patients.

DISCUSSION
Little is known about the deregulation of miR644a in cancer. It has been shown that high expression of
miR-644a (previously known as miR-644 according to
49868

Oncotarget

miRBase release 21 [41]) is correlated with shorter overall
survival in Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [42], and miR644a is found to be upregulated in bladder cancer [43].
On the contrary, miR-644a overexpression was shown
to downregulate an isoform of the androgen receptor,
and decrease viability in prostate cancer cell lines [44].
However, there is no functional study on miR-644a, and
its deregulation in breast cancer has not been reported.
Here, we demonstrated that miR-644a acts as a tumor
suppressor in breast cancer by regulating tumor progression,
metastasis, and drug resistance affecting the patient
survival (Figure 7Q). We identified the transcriptional corepressor CTBP1 as the major functional target of miR644a phenocopying all its effects on cell proliferation,
apoptosis, EMT and drug resistance. Its loss upon miR-644a

overexpression on one hand leads to G1 arrest or apoptosis
by increasing p53 expression and on the other hand leads to
increased E-Cadherin to inhibit EMT and metastasis.
It has been known that activated p53 can either
lead to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in a highly context
dependent manner. As reviewed by Haupt et al. [45] and
Fridman et al. [46], cell type, strength and nature of the
stimulus as well as the presence of collateral signals can
determine cell fate in the presence of a stress stimulus.
Importance of the latter has been shown in case of DNA
damage during which Myc shifts the balance of cell
fate from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis by blocking p21
induction via recruiting Miz-1 to p21 promoter site, and
thereby preventing p53-mediated transcription [47, 48].
Therefore, we also checked changes in Myc expression

with miR-644a overexpression, but did not observe an
induction in Myc levels (data not shown), which might be
due to the presence of a stimulus other than DNA damage
in our system. Here, we propose that the mutation status of
p53 is yet another factor that is important for the decision
of undergoing either to cell cycle arrest or to apoptosis.
Our results demonstrated that increase in p53 levels upon
miR-644a overexpression or CTBP1 knockdown increases
p21 which protects cells from p53-dependent apoptosis
[17], and causes cell cycle arrest in p53-wt cells whereas
it induces apoptosis via increasing the expression of
pro-apoptotic gene Noxa in p53-mut cells. We saw that
overexpression of mut-p53 in p53-wt MCF-7 cells was
enough to shift the balance between cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in favor of apoptosis through upregulation of an
established pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, Noxa, even
though p21 was still induced (Supplementary Figure S6G
and S6I).
p53 is mutated in 30% of breast cancer which
causes several defects in p53 functioning like altered DNA
binding affinity or loss of transcriptional activity [49, 50].
However, there is substantial evidence showing that mutant
p53 is still able to induce apoptosis through different
mechanisms. It has been shown that a transcriptionally
inactive mutant p53 can still activate the pro-apoptotic
gene Bax upon DNA damage [51], and some transcriptiondefective mutants retain significant apoptotic activity
independent of Bax induction [52, 53]. These suggest that
in case of p53 mutation, a “gain of pathway” phenomenon
occurs which may involve either transcription-dependent
or independent activation of a different set of proapoptotic genes [54]. Our results support these findings
with regard to induction of apoptosis by miR-644a in p53mutant breast cancer cells by activation of Noxa. Notably,
although we found no correlation of CTBP1 levels with
the survival of breast cancer patients (Supplementary
Figure S7C–S7H), in all datasets that we analyzed, we
confirm that p53-mut patients with breast or ovarian cancer
that show high CTBP1 level are associated with a worse
survival as compared to the patients with low CTBP1
group (Figure 7M–7P). This suggests that CTBP1 could be
a potential prognostic factor for breast cancer patients with
p53 mutations which may be due to the fact that apoptosis
induction is more effective on prolonging overall survival
of patients than p53-dependent growth arrest.
As EMT and cell survival are closely related with
drug resistance, we examined the effects of miR-644a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and its target CTBP1 on drug sensitization, and observed
that overexpression of miR-644a sensitized different
breast cancer cells representing different subtypes to both
chemotherapy and targeted therapy agents e.g. tamoxifen
and gefitinib. In addition, low CTBP1 correlated with
better response (Figure 6A) and longer distant metastasisfree survival of breast cancer patients treated with
chemotherapy (Figure 6B). We have previously shown
that miR-375 blocks EMT and sensitizes MCF-7 cells to
tamoxifen [55]. Similarly, it has been shown that miR-147
blocks EMT and sensitizes colon cancer cells to gefinitib
[56]. Although these drugs have different targets and
mechanisms of action, we reveal miR-644a as a pleotropic
sensitizer, which suggests that the inhibition of EMT might
be a common nominator for sensitization to all drugs
tested. However, as CTBP1 can increase the expression
of MDR1 gene transcriptionally [57], we cannot rule
out the alternative of possible downregulation of MDR1
upon miR-644a expression, which leads to inhibition of
multi-drug resistance. Nevertheless, our results suggest
that miR-644a or its target CTBP1 could be a potential
drug candidate which can simultaneously block primary
tumor growth, metastasis, and finally sensitize cancer
cells to several different drugs. A recent study reported a
small molecule, NSC95397, which inhibits the interaction
between CTBP1 and its binding partners and blocks the
CTBP1-mediated transcriptional repression [58]. Although
using miRNAs as potential drugs could need longer time,
small molecules targeting CTBP1 could act as potential
drugs for cancer therapy in the near future. In conclusion,
the miR-644a/CTBP1/p53 axis acts not only as biomarker
of progression and drug response, but also could be
targeted for cancer therapy.

insulin (0.01 mg/ml), 0.002% EGF (20 ng/ml) (both from
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA). All media were
supplemented with 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin,
1% non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine
serum (Lonza, NJ, USA). All cell lines were tested for
mycoplasma contamination regularly using MycoAlert
mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, NJ, USA).

using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche).
Sequences of the primers were provided elsewhere
(Supplementary Table S5). ACTB and HPRT were used
as housekeeping genes. Data were analyzed according
to ΔΔCT method [61]. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for
miRNAs was done as previously described [9]. RNU44
was used as the housekeeping gene.

Western blot

Transient transfection with miRNA mimics,
hairpin inhibitors, siRNAs and expression
constructs

Whole-cell lysates were prepared using RIPA
lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor Complete Mini
(Roche, Basel), anti-phosphatase PhosSTOP (Roche,
Basel), 10 mM NaF and 1 mM Na4VO3. Protein
concentrations were determined with BCA Protein Assay
Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Proteins
were denatured with 4× loading dye containing 10%
SDS and 50% glycerol at 95°C for 5 minutes, and 20 μg
proteins were loaded in each lane. Protein samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE and incubated with primary
antibodies (Supplementary Table S6). Horseradish
peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies
(Cell signaling Technology, USA) were used as secondary
antibodies, and signals were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).

Transfections were carried out as previously
described [59]. Sequence of miR-644a mimic was
AGUGUGGCUUUCUUAGAGC. For miRNA mimic
viability screen, miRNA mimics were transfected
at a concentration of 20 nM for 48 hours. For other
experiments, miR-644a and all siRNA transfections
were done at a concentration of 40 nM whereas hairpin
inhibitors were transfected at a concentration of 100 nM
for either 48 hours or 72 hours. 50 ng (for 96-well
experiments) or 500 ng (for 6-well experiments) per
well of GFP tagged CTBP1 (NM_001012614; Cat. No.
RG208594) human ORF Clone and Myc-DDK tagged
TP53 (NM_000546; Cat. No. RC200003) human mutant
ORF Clone vector were purchased from Origene and used
for overexpression and rescue experiments. Latter one
expresses transcript variant 1 of Homo sapiens protein p53
having an R175H mutation.

Cell cycle, viability and apoptosis assays
Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously
described [62]. Transfections were done in 6-well plates
(2.5 × 105 cells per well) in triplicates. For drug sensitization
assays, drug treatments were done one day after miRNA
mimic or siRNA transfections with doxorubicin (0.05–10
uM), cisplatin (0.001–30 uM), tamoxifen (2.5–40 uM) or
gefitinib (0.1–20 uM) for 72 hours. Cell viability (including
viability of miRNA mimic screen and drug sensitization
assays) and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Titer Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assays
(Promega, WI, USA), respectively according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cell viability after polyHEMA
assay was assessed with WST-1 assay (Roche) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Plasmid construction and site-directed
mutagenesis
The construction of plasmid carrying 3ʹ-UTR
sequence of CTBP1 gene was done as previously described
[9]. The 967 bp length 3ʹ-UTR which contained last exon
sequence common to two transcript variants of CTBP1 and
annotated CCDS in NCBI Consensus Coding Sequence
database [60] was used to design the primers. Primers used
were 5′-GGCACTCGAGCTGCTGTGGAAGGTAT-3′ and
5′-ATACAAGCGGCCGCAGTCACAAACATGATTTTA
AC-3′. For site-directed mutagenesis, the predicted hsamiR-644a target site of the previously described psiCheck2/
CTBP1–3ʹUTRwt construct were disrupted by four point
mutations in the seed region (Supplementary Figure S3A).

RTCA proliferation and migration assays
Real time growth and migration of MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells were monitored
using xCelligence Real-time Cell Analyzer system
(Acea Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously
described [9, 59]. For invasion assay, cells were
transfected as described above and seeded in Matrigel
invasion chambers (BD Pharmingen) in 1% FBS DMEM.
After 48 hours, number of invaded cells were counted
by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur) and analyzed by Cell
Quest Pro software (BD Bioscience). In wound healing
assay, 1 × 105 cells were seeded on 24-well plates, and

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs and
miRNAs
Total RNA was isolated using TRIsure (Bioline,
Luckenwalde, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed
using RevertAid RT Reverse Transcription Kit (Life
Technologies), following manufacturer’s instructions.

mice were injected with 2 × 106 cells into both left and
right mammary fat pads (MFP) subcutaneously without
incision, with 5–6 mice per group. Tumor growth was
monitored by measuring the tumor volume twice a week
with a caliper after tumors become palpable. Tumor
volumes were calculated as length × width2/2. All the mice
were sacrificed once one of the mice reached threshold
of 1500 mm3 volume, and tumors were collected and
weighed. For doxorubicin response experiments, primary
tumors were developed using above mentioned protocol,
and mice were treated with a dose of 5 mg/kg body
weight of mice weekly through intravenous injection
when tumors became palpable. In the beginning, all
tumors showed sensitivity towards treatment and showed
decrease in volume. Some of these sensitive tumors
were collected after 8–10 weeks of treatment. Later,
remaining tumors started to increase in size, and showed
resistance towards treatment, and these resistant tumors
were collected after 12–15 weeks of treatment. For tailvein metastasis assay, 1.5 × 106 cells were injected into
tail vein of each 6–8 weeks old female athymic Nu/nu
mice, with 3–5 mice per group. The mice were sacrificed,
and lung metastasis was evaluated once one of the
mice became moribund with a luciferase assay. Due to
heterogeneous distribution of nodules, three different parts
were randomly collected from each lung to make a tissue
pool and weighed for normalization. Lung tissues were
ground in cold PBS by tissue homogenizer and treated
with lysis buffer (Promega). 500 ul lysis buffer was added
to 140–180 mg weight. After 15 min incubation, 100 ul
of luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to 20 ul of
the lysed sample, and luminescence was measured with a
luminometer. For Bouin’s fixation, harvested lungs were
cleaned with PBS and placed into Bouin’s solution on a
shaker for overnight. After fixation they were kept in 70%
alcohol. The lung samples used for Bouin’s fixation were
excluded from luciferase assay and H&E staining.

Dual luciferase reporter assay
Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed as
previously described [9]. Luciferase activity was measured
in Synergy HT microplate reader machine (BioTek,
Vermont, US) after 24 hours of transfection, and values
were normalized to firefly luciferase activity.

Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy
Nuclear staining of cells were done with 4,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and filamentous
actin were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (1:40;
Invitrogen) as previously described [9]. Coverslips were
mounted with Shandon Immu-Mount reagent. Images
were taken using a Zeiss microscopy.

Lentiviral vector constructs and infection
SMARTchoice human lentiviral hsa-miR-644a
shMIMIC hCMV-turboGFP, GIPZ human CTBP1 shRNA
vectors with clone IDs V3LHS_380132, V3LHS_398420
and V3LHS_113279 encoding different shRNAs
sequences and GIPZ non-silencing lentiviral shRNA
control were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).
MDA-MB-231.luc cells (a kind gift from Dr. Dihua Yu
(MD Anderson, TX)) were transduced with miR-644a viral
particles in 24-wells plate, and 96 hours post-transduction,
selection with 1 μg/ml of puromycin was started. To
produce viral particles with CTBP1 shRNAs and nonsilencing shRNA control, 6 μg of each of these vectors
and 4.3 μl of trans-lentiviral packaging mix (Dharmacon)
were used to co-transfect HEK293FT cells in 6-wells
plate with CaCl2 reagent (Dharmacon). 48 hours posttransfection, first viral particles were harvested. 96 hours
post-transduction, selection with 1 μg/ml of puromycin
was started. LentiCRISPRv2 vector was a kind gift from
Dr. Feng Zhang (MIT, Boston, MA) [63]. For sgRNA
design (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C), candidate
target sequences were determined using E-CRISPR
tool [64]. For the packaging of pLentiCRISPR/CTBP1
sgRNA1 and pLentiCRISPR/CTBP1 sgRNA2 vectors,
30% confluent HEK293FT cells in 100 mm plates have
been co-transfected using 42 μg of these vectors, 31.5 μg
of pMD2.G (Addgene) and 21 μg psPAX2 (Addgene).
Transfection, transduction and selection were performed
as described previously for GIPZ vectors series.

miRNA target prediction
Targetscan release 6.2 (http://www.targetscan.
org), PITA miRNA target recognition from Segal Lab
of Computational Biology (http://genie.weizmann.ac.il)
and miRDB (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/index.html) was
used as target prediction algorithms for identification of
miR-644a targets. Common predicted targets between all
three databases and downregulated genes by miR-644a
(microarray results) were represented in a Venn diagram
using Venny 2.0.

Microarray analysis

In vivo experiments

Expression profiling data were normalized with
quantile normalization. Quality control and differential
gene expression analysis was conducted using limma in
Bioconductor [65]. Microarray data can be retrieved from

Cell line and patient data were retrieved from the
NCBI GEO database (GSE4922, GSE2603, GSE16446,
GSE19536,
GSE22220,
GSE38167,
GSE40059,
GSE45666, GSE58606 and GSE58644) and from the
Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
Consortium (METABRIC) project with data deposited
in EMBL European Genome–Phenome Archive (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/), with an accession number
EGAS00000000122. A brief summary of these datasets
is provided in Supplementary Table S4. For GSE19536,
patient data were retrieved from GSE3985 which is a former
study done with the same patient samples and which is
providing more detailed patient data. Significance scores of
genes up and down-regulated by miR-644a were calculated
as previously described [66]. miR-644a signature score was
defined as the ratio of the significance scores of genes up
and down-regulated by miR-644a. For the GSEA analysis,
patients in GSE58644 dataset were grouped based on their
miR-644a significance score ratios, which we defined as
the miR-644a signature score. For the GSEA analysis with
GSE22220 dataset, patients expressing high levels of miR644a were separated into two groups as p53-mut and p53-wt.
Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier method.
Patients without any available survival time or event were
excluded from the corresponding patient groups. All
separations were done from median. For KM Plotter curves,
‘best cut-off’ option was selected for the separation of
patients. Significance of the differences in survival between
two groups was calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
For the separation of patients as p53-wt or p53-mut, data
provided by the publishers of the studies were utilized if
available. In GSE58644 and GSE22220, the separation was
done by clustering patients according to their expression
levels of a gene signature associated with p53 status [32].
The accuracy of p53 status prediction with this gene
signature was tested by using data from GSE19536 in which
p53 status of the patients was provided. 85% and 77% of the
p53-mut and p53-wt patients, respectively could be predicted
from their expression levels of the p53 status signature. The
generated heatmap is provided as Supplementary Figure S8.
Heatmaps for the other datasets with accession numbers
GSE58644 and GSE22220 are provided as Supplementary
Figure S9. Gene ontology analyses were done with DAVID
bioinformatics tool [67]. For the microarray datasets
that contain negative expression values, a small number
was added such that all values became positive [68].
Comparisons between two groups were made by twotailed student t-test. Significance cut-off were taken as
P = 0.05. For the real-time cell growth experiments, data
were normalized to time of transfection and statistical
significance was determined with a paired, two-tailed
