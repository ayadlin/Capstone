Abstract
In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) treatment induces granulocytic maturation and complete remission of leukemia. microRNAs are known to be
critical players in the formation of the leukemic phenotype.
In this study, we report downregulation of the miR-181a/b gene
cluster in APL blasts and NB4 leukemia cells upon ATRA
treatment as a key event in the drug response. We found that
miR-181a/b expression was activated by the PML/RARa oncogene in cells and transgenic knock-in mice, an observation
conﬁrmed and extended by evidence of enhanced expression
of miR-181a/b in APL patient specimens. RNA interference
(RNAi)-mediated attenuation of miR-181a/b expression in
NB4 cells was sufﬁcient to reduce colony-forming capacity,

proliferation, and survival. Mechanistic investigations revealed
that miR-181a/b targets the ATRA-regulated tumor suppressor
gene RASSF1A by direct binding to its 30 -untranslated region.
Enforced expression of miR-181a/b or RNAi-mediated attenuation of RASSF1A inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation via regulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1.
Conversely, RASSF1A overexpression enhanced apoptosis.
Finally, RASSF1A levels were reduced in PML/RARa knock-in
mice and APL patient samples. Taken together, our results
deﬁne miR-181a and miR-181b as oncomiRs in PML/RARaassociated APL, and they reveal RASSF1A as a pivotal element in
the granulocytic differentiation program induced by ATRA in
APL. Cancer Res; 75(16); 3411–24. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

small RNAs that play critical roles in the posttranscriptional
regulation of target genes by direct targeting of mRNAs for cleavage,
translational repression, or destabilization (7). A selected
number of miRNAs has been shown to play key roles in hematopoietic differentiation (8) as well as in the formation and maintenance of leukemia (9). We and others already showed that miR223, miR-34a, and miR-30c are important factors in myeloid
differentiation (10–13). While some miRNAs like miR-223 have
been implied in APL differentiation (14) and tumorigenesis, there
is still a lack of knowledge about the expression and function of
other miRNAs.
In this study, we showed that the genomic clustered miR-181a
and miR-181b (miR-181a/b) are highly expressed in APL and
downregulated during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced
differentiation (14–16). By analyzing APL and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patient samples as well as PML/RARa knock-in
mice, we demonstrated that miR-181a and miR-181b display a
very speciﬁc PML/RARa dependency in vivo. Furthermore, we
revealed that miR-181a and miR-181b are involved in the formation of the PML/RARa caused oncogenic phenotype. We
showed that the miR-181a/b function is determined by the direct
binding to their target RASSF1A. Finally, we ﬁrstly describe the
tumor suppressor RASSF1A as a new and essential member of the
retinoic acid–induced differentiation network in APL.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by speciﬁc
chromosomal translocations involving the retinoic acid receptor
a (RARa; refs. 1, 2). The most frequent translocation fuses the
RARa with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) gene (3).
At physiological levels of retinoids, the PML/RARa fusion protein
causes block of differentiation and neoplastic transformation by
disrupting the function of PML and repressing transcription of
genes regulated by RARa (2, 4, 5). Pharmalogic doses of retinoids
can overcome this block, lead to the expression of granulocytic
speciﬁc transcription factors like C/EBPb (6), and thereby induce
terminal differentiation of APL blasts in vitro and in vivo (1, 2).
Recent studies identiﬁed a group of small molecules that are
involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression.
microRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous, non–protein-coding

Germany) and from the OSHO patient sample collection (Leipzig, Germany). Blood cells samples from patients without any
hematopoietic disease were obtained from the University Hospital Halle (Halle, Germany). Ethics committee approval was
obtained and all patients provided informed consent. All samples
were karyotyped and molecular genetic analysis was performed
previously.
Transgenic mouse model
Bone marrow cells from 5 PML/RARa knock-in mice (C57BI/6mCGþ/PR), in which PML/RARa is expressed under the control of
the murine cathepsin G gene (C57BI/6-mGCþ/PR), and 5 wildtype mice (C57BI/6-WT) were obtained from Pier Giuseppe
Pelicci (IFOM-EIO, Milan, Italy; ref. 17).
Cells, reagents, and transfections
NB4, HL60 and U937 cells were cultured under standard conditions. For differentiation, cells were induced with 106 mol/L
ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich) and as control DMSO. For differentiation of
miRNA mimic transfected and RASSF1A shRNA-expressing NB4
cells, 107 mol/L ATRA were used. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3; SigmaAldrich) were used at 1 mmol/L. As control 1% HCl solution was
used. Doxorubicin (Selleckchem), solved in DMSO, was applied at
0.01 mg/mL and cytarabine at 0.05 mmol/L. Transfection of miRNA
mimics (Dharmacon) and pcDNA3.1 vectors was done by using
Amaxa Technology (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The transfection efﬁciency was 30% to 40%. U937PR9 cells, which carry the PML/RARa cDNA under the control of
metallothionine promoter, and the control cells U937-PC-18,
which carry the empty vector, were cultured, and the expression
of the PML/RARa fusion protein was induced as previously
described (18).
DNA constructs, cloning, and mutagenesis
For luciferase assay, RASSF1A 30 untranslated region (UTR) was
inserted in the pGL3-luciferase reporter control vector downstream of the luciferase encoding region (Promega). MiR-181–
binding site positions in the 30 UTR were taken from the miRNA
target data base targetscan (www.targetscan.org). The RASSF1A
30 UTR (Acc. No.[NM_007182.4]) was ampliﬁed from cDNA of
NB4 cells treated with 1 mmol/L ATRA for 48 hours using primer
pairs, which generate a XbaI restriction enzyme recognition site at
the 30 - and 50 -ends of the ampliﬁed DNA product. The following
primer pairs were used: RASSF1A 30 UTR: forward, 50 -GTCTAGACCTCTTGTACCCCCAGGTGG-30 ; reverse, 50 -GTCTAGAGAGGATCTTGAAATCTTTATTGAG-30 . The puriﬁed DNA fragment
and the pGL3 luciferase reporter control vector were digested
with XbaI and fused in a T4 ligase reaction (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of miR-181–binding sites was done with the QuikChange
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. All sequences were veriﬁed by
sequencing. pcDNA3.1/RASSF1A expression vector was a kind gift
from Reinhard Dammann (Justus-Liebig University, Giessen,
Germany).
Luciferase reporter assay
To prove the direct binding of miR-181a/b to the 30 UTR of
RASSF1A mRNA, U937 cells were transiently cotransfected with
0.5 mg of each reporter construct (pGL3 control vector, pGL3/
30 UTR-RASSF1A, and pGL3/30 UTR-RASSF1A mutated), 0.1 mg of

Renilla construct (pRL) and 1 mmol/L miR-181a, miR-181b
mimics, or control mimics using Amaxa Technology (Lonza).
Luciferase activities were determined 24 hours after transfection
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Values were normalized using Renilla luciferase.
Lentivirus production and transduction
pmiR-ZIP-lentivirus vectors were purchased from System Biosciences, and p-RFP-CB-shLenti vectors were purchased from
Origene. miR-ZIP-lentiviral particles were produced according to
the manufacturer's instructions. NB4 cells were infected two times
within 48 hours with 10 mL of PEG-it–concentrated viral particles
followed by Puromycin selection of transduced cells for additional 7 days followed by FACS-GFP sorting to create stable miRZIP NB4 cell lines. For generating a RASSF1A-knockdown NB4 cell
line, viral particles were produced by tranfecting 293NT cells with
a set of four different shRNA vectors and the control shRNA vector
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selection of shRNAexpressing clones was performed by using blasticidin for 2 weeks.
Cell growth assay
NB4 cells stably transduced with pmiR-ZIP-181a, pmiR-ZIP181b, or control vector were plated in a density of 1  104 cells/mL.
Proliferation rate was ascertained by cell counting in a Neubauer camber using Trypan blue staining for excluding death
cells.
Clonogenic assay
NB4 cells stably expressing anti-miR-181a, anti-miR-181b, or
an unspeciﬁc control sequence were seeded in a density of 1  103
cells/mL in methylcellulose-based media (MethoCult H4230;
StemCell Technologies) as triplicates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Replating was done after 6 days and repeated
three times. Colony numbers were evaluated after each plating by
standard criteria. For colony size measurement, pictures were
taken randomly from each condition and a total number of
135 colonies were measured by using ImageJ software.
miRNA and mRNA detection by quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol. miRNA quantiﬁcation
was performed as previously described by using hsa-miR-181a
and hsa-miR-181b primer sets or mmu-miR-181a and mmu-miR181b-1 primer sets (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Normalization was
done by measuring RNU6B (U6) expression and small nuclear
RNA135 (snoR135) expression. mRNA ampliﬁcation was performed as previously described by using GAPDH expression for
normalization (11). Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S3. PCR reactions were performed in a MyiQ2 TwoColor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described
(11). Following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal and
polyclonal antibody anti-RASSF1A for analyzing human cell lines
and primary patient cell samples, rabbit polyclonal antibody antiRASSF1 for analyzing mouse bone marrow samples (both
Abcam) and rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-RARa, rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-cyclin D1 and rabbit polyclonal antibody
anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-b-tubulin and anti-GAPDH were used for normalization

(both Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodetection was performed with WesternSure Chemiluminescent Substrate (LI-COR
Biosciences). Band intensities were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Flow cytometry
Cell differentiation was evaluated by direct immunoﬂuorescent staining using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse antihuman CD11b/Mac-1, allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated
mouse anti-human CD11b/Mac-1 (BD Biosciences), and
APC-conjugated mouse anti-CD114 (GCSF-R; Biolegend) cell
surface myeloid-speciﬁc antigens. Apoptosis was measured
with a PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell cycle was
measured by performing ethanol ﬁxation of cells followed by
RNAse A digestion and propidium iodide staining of DNA. A
minimum of 10,000 events were collected for each sample by a
FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest
software for data acquisition and Cyﬂogic software for data
analysis.
Statistical analysis
We used the Student t test to determine statistical signiﬁcance of
experimental results. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered
signiﬁcant ( ) and a P value of 0.01 or less were considered as
highly signiﬁcant ( ). The results were represented as the median
 SD from three independent experiments for cell line experiments and from two independent reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis for primary cell samples.

Results
ATRA treatment represses miR-181 family member expression
in APL cell line and in APL patients
Several studies show the modulation of miRNA pattern upon
ATRA treatment (10, 14, 19). We analyzed miR-181 family
member expression (miR-181a-d) 24 hours after ATRA treatment and observed a signiﬁcant downregulation of all miR-181
family members (Fig. 1A). The genomically clustered miR-181a
and miR-181b show similar expression levels, whereas miR181c and miR-181d, also organized in a genomic cluster,
were differentially expressed (20). miR-223 expression was
used as experimental control and showed a 2-fold upregulation
(Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, we induced granulocytic differentiation by ATRA
in NB4 cells and the non-APL cell lines U937 and HL60. Differentiation was conﬁrmed by CD11b measurement (Fig. 1C, E, and
G). NB4 cells showed a signiﬁcant reduction of miR-181a/b
expression over time (Fig. 1D). No signiﬁcant change of miR181a/b expression could be observed in U937 (Fig. 1F) and HL60
cells (Fig. 1H).
In clinical APL therapy, ATRA is used in combination with
anthracyclines, cytarabines, and arsenic trioxide. To test their
effects on miR-181a/b expression, NB4 cells were treated with
anthracycline (doxorubicin) with or without cytarabine (ara-c)
or arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and the appreciate controls for 24
hours. The results showed no repression of miR-181a/b expression after treatment with cytostatics or arsenic trioxide in contrast
to ATRA, which strongly reduced the miRNA expression (Fig. 1I
and J). 7-Aminoactinomycin D (AAD)/Annexin V measurement
revealed strong induction of apoptosis by cytostatics and As2O3.

CD11b cell surface marker and C/EBPb mRNA were slightly
and only temporary induced by As2O3 or cytostatics compared
with ATRA, which strongly induced granulopoiesis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, we used samples from patients
with APL who received a combination of ATRA with chemotherapy to investigate the expression of miR-181a/b. Analysis
was performed at time point of diagnosis and at one time
point during therapy (Supplementary Table S1). In all six
analyzed patients, we observed a highly signiﬁcant repression
of miR-181a/b expression in consequence to ATRA-based therapy (Fig. 1K and L).
miRNA-181a/b are induced by the oncogenic fusion protein
PML/RARa in vivo and in vitro
The oncogenic fusion protein PML/RARa is known to regulate a huge number of different genes (16, 18, 21). To show
the regulatory inﬂuence of PML/RARa on miR-181a/b expression, we induced PML/RARa protein in U937-PR9 cells with
ZnSO4. miR-181a/b expression was immediately upregulated
upon PML/RARa induction (Fig. 2A). The control cell line
U937-PC18 showed no signiﬁcant change in miRNA expression after ZnSO4 application (Fig. 2B). In addition, we analyzed bone marrow samples from PML/RARa knock-in mice
and wild-type animals (C57BI/6-WT; ref. 17). We observed a
signiﬁcant enhanced expression of murine miR-181a/b in
PML/RARa knock-in mouse samples in comparison to wildtype samples (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we analyzed bone marrow samples from patients with different AML subtypes
and blood cell samples from healthy donors. The results
showed signiﬁcantly higher miR-181a/b expression values in
APL patient samples than in the samples with normal karyotype, whereas all other analyzed samples showed no signiﬁcant miRNA expression change (Supplementary Table S2
and Fig. 2D).
The miR-181a/b cluster is necessary for proliferation, induces
apoptosis, and inhibits granulocytic differentiation of APL cells
To address the role of miR-181a/b in APL in detail, we
stably knocked down both miRNAs in NB4 cells by using
miR-ZIP-lentiviral particles. Knockdown efﬁciency was veriﬁed
by qPCR (Fig. 3A). The PML/RARa fusion protein promotes cell
survival (4). To evaluate a potential role for miR-181a and miR181b in this process, we examined an apoptosis assay. Knockdown of miR-181a and miR-181b results in signiﬁcantly increased
apoptosis (Fig. 3B). According to this, p53 protein was induced in
the miR-ZIP-181a and -181b expressing cells compared with the
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, in a replating
assay, we could show strongly reduced colony size and colonyforming capacity of NB4 cells after knockdown of miR-181a and
miR-181b (Fig. 3C and D). According to this, the proliferation rate
of miR-ZIP-181a- or miR-ZIP-181b–expressing cells was signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 3E).
To investigate the inﬂuence of miR-181a/b on ATRA-induced
differentiation of APL cells, we transiently transfected NB4 cells
with miR-181a- and miR-181b–speciﬁc mimics and control
mimics. Granulocytic differentiation was induced by ATRA 24
hours after transfection. CD11b expression was signiﬁcantly
decreased after overexpression of one of the miRNAs in comparison to the control 48 hours after transfection. The effect was
slightly increased by simultaneous transfection of miR-181a and

miR-181a/b Targets RASSF1A in APL

miR-181b mimics (Fig. 3F). In addition, qPCR showed a strong
decrease of ATRA induced C/EBPb and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) receptor mRNA expression 48 hours after
miR-181a and miR-181b mimic transfection in comparison to the
control (Fig. 3G).
The tumor suppressor RASSF1A is a direct target of the
miR-181a/b cluster
We hypothesized that miR-181a and miR-181b are involved
in formation of the PML/RARa-induced oncogenic transformation by targeting differentiation-required genes. By computational analysis using miRNA target prediction programs
such as Target Scan (http://www.targetscan.org), we identiﬁed
the tumor suppressor Ras association domain family member
1 isoform A (RASSF1A) as a putative target of the miR-181
family (Fig. 4D). RASSF1A is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that is epigenetically suppressed by promoter hypermethylation in a wide range of tumors (22). In APL, no case is
reported until now (23). We evaluated RASSF1A protein in
NB4 cells by Western blotting. The data showed a signiﬁcant
increase of RASSF1A protein upon ATRA treatment over time
(Fig. 4A). Interestingly, RASSF1A protein showed no upregulation in NB4 cells upon induction of apoptosis by arsenic
trioxide (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The 30 UTR
of RASSF1A harbors three potential miR-181–binding sites
(Fig. 4C). To analyze direct binding of miR-181a and miR181b to the 30 UTR of RASSF1A, we generated a luciferase
construct containing the complete 30 UTR of RASSF1A and
mutated the binding sites (Fig. 4D and E). Reporter assay
showed repression of luciferase activity after miR-181a and
miR-181b mimic transfection in comparison to the control.
Mutation of the miR-181–binding sites resulted in the recovery
of luciferase activity and revealed direct binding of miR-181a/b
to the 30 UTR of RASSF1A (Fig. 4F).
To validate our ﬁnding that RASSF1A is a direct target of miR181a/b, we analyzed RASSF1A protein after miR-181a and miR181b mimic transfection in U937 cells and observed repression
of RASSF1A protein 24 hours and much stronger 48 hours after
transfection (Fig. 4G). In addition, RASSF1A protein was
increased after miR-ZIP–mediated knockdown of miR-181a
and miR-181b in NB4 cells compared with the control cells
(Fig. 4H).
RASSF1A protein is speciﬁcally suppressed in APL
RASSF1A is shown to be an important regulator of cell
differentiation in a wide range of cell types (22) by exercising
its functions as a modulator of two pathways commonly
deregulated in cancer, apoptosis, and cell cycle (24, 25). Therefore, we hypothesize that RASSF1A could function as tumor
suppressor in APL, where PML/RARa causes oncogenic transformation by deregulating cell cycle and apoptosis (4).

Western blot analysis of bone marrow samples from patients
with different AML subtypes and blood cell samples from healthy
donors showed signiﬁcantly lower amounts of RASSF1A protein
in patients with APL compared with patients with AML with
normal karyotype (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5A). No
signiﬁcant change in RASSF1A protein levels could be observed in
other AML subtypes and in non-AML samples. Interestingly,
RASSF1A mRNA exhibited a heterogeneous distribution and
especially no reduction in t(15;17) (Fig. 5B). Furthermore,
we observed signiﬁcantly lower RASSF1A protein levels in
PML/RARa knock-in mice (C57BI/6-mCGþ/PR) compared with
wild-type animals (C57BI/6-WT) (Fig. 5C).
RASSF1A is essential for ATRA-induced granulocytic
differentiation and induces apoptosis in APL
To verify the hypothesized differentiation-associated function
of RASSF1A, we used a set of four constructs encoding different
shRNA sequences speciﬁc for RASSF1A mRNA to generate a stable
NB4 RASSF1A-knockdown cell line. The knockdown efﬁciency
was conﬁrmed by qPCR and showed a signiﬁcant reduction of
RASSF1A mRNA to 0.2-fold in the RASSF1A shRNAs expressing
cells in comparison to the cells expressing an unspeciﬁc shRNA
(Fig. 6A). ATRA-induced CD11b expression and GCSF-R expression were strongly repressed in RASSF1A shRNA-expressing cells
in comparison to the control cells (Fig. 6B). Transient overexpression of RASSF1A was performed to point out the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in APL. Apoptosis assay displayed a
strong increase in the Annexin V–positive cell population 24
hours after pcDNA3.1-RASSF1A transfection in comparison to
the empty vector transfection (Fig. 6C).
miR-181a/b and RASSF1A modulate differentiation in APL via
regulation of cell cycle
ATRA-induced cell growth arrest and terminal differentiation of
APL blasts involves downregulation of cyclin D1 (26). To conﬁrm
the ATRA-dependent downregulation of cyclin D1 in APL cells, we
performed Western blotting 48 hours after ATRA stimulation of
NB4 cells and observed a decrease in cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 7A).
RASSF1A is also able to induce cell-cycle arrest by inhibition of
cyclin D1 accumulation (24). Overexpression of RASSSF1A by
pcDNA3.1/RASSF1A resulted in a complete repression of cyclin
D1 protein in NB4 cells after 24 hours in comparison to the
control vector transfection (Fig. 7B). We also performed cell-cycle
analysis 24 hours after ATRA treatment of RASSF1A shRNAexpressing NB4 cells and observed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of RASSF1A leads to a marked reduction in G1–G0 phase

Discussion
An increasing number of studies have shown the importance of
miRNAs in the formation and maintenance of leukemia. In this
report, we demonstrate that ATRA is able to signiﬁcantly downregulate the expression of the whole miR-181 family in APL (Fig.
1A). We show the constant downregulation of the miR-181a/b
cluster upon ATRA treatment over time in APL in vitro and in vivo
(Fig. 1D, K, and L). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytostatics
and arsenic trioxide, which are typically used in APL therapy and
are predominately inducers of apoptosis, do not affect miR-181a/b
expression (Fig. 1I and J). These results expand and conﬁrm
previous observations (10, 14–16) and suggest a speciﬁc role for

3420 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

the miR-181 family in the response to ATRA in APL. Diverse
publications illustrate the expression pattern and deﬁne multiple
functions for miR-181a and miR-181b in hematopoiesis and
leukemia, whereas miR-181c and miR-181d are less described
(8, 27–31). The fact that ATRA leads to the degradation of PML/
RARa and thereby changes gene expression, assuming that miR181a/b expression is dependent on PML/RARa (1). We followed
miR-181a/b expression upon ATRA treatment of the non-APL cell
lines U937 and HL60. Both cell lines respond to ATRA but show
no signiﬁcant change in miR-181a/b expression (Fig. 1E–H). This
observation substantiates the proposed PML/RARa dependency
of miR-181a/b expression.
The miR-181a/b cluster has been shown to be upregulated in
patients with AML with C/EBPa mutations who have a favorable prognosis and have also shown to be associated with
favorable outcome in patients with cytogenetically normal AML
and cytogenetically abnormal AML (32–34). Combining these
data, high expression of miR-181a and miR-181b occurs in
combination with a favorable outcome of AML. In APL, a
combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide therapy generates
a complete remission rate (CR) of more than 90% (35). Our
observation that the miR-181a/b cluster is highly expressed in

miR-181a/b Targets RASSF1A in APL

accumulation of cyclin D1. Treatment of APL blasts with pharmacologic doses of ATRA leads to the destruction of the PML/RARa fusion protein followed by
repression of miR-181a/b transcription in vitro and in vivo. This results in the recovery of RASSF1A protein synthesis, which leads to cell-cycle arrest and differentiation

In addition, we show signiﬁcantly higher expression of the miR181a/b cluster in bone marrow samples from patients with APL
(Fig. 2D). These results are reinforced by data from Li and

together, to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to show
PML/RARa-dependent upregulation of the miR-181a/b cluster in
AML. Because PML/RARa has no direct binding site in the promoter region of the miR-181a/b cluster (16), the transcriptional
induction has to occur indirectly. The exact mechanism how
the miRNA cluster is regulated is still unknown and has to be
investigated in further experiments.
Diverse publications describe miR-181 family members as
either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in various cancers depending on tissue type (37–40). The fact that miR-181a/b expression is
signiﬁcantly high in t(15;17), assuming that both miRNAs are
involved in the formation of the oncogenic phenotype caused by
PML/RARa. Our functional studies show that ectopic expression
of miR-181a and miR-181b effectively blocks ATRA-induced
granulocytic differentiation (Fig. 3F and G) and that inhibition
of the miR-181a/b cluster effectively represses cell proliferation
and induces apoptosis in APL cells (Fig. 3A–E). In contrast to
data from Hickey and colleagues (33) and Li and colleagues
(34) who assign miR-181a as an anti-leukemic miRNA in AML,
our results show an oncogenic function for the miR-181a/b
cluster in APL. This is supported by recently published data
from Su and colleagues, which showed that miR-181a blocks
myeloid differentiation of HL60 and CD34þ hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells (41).
In cancer, oncogenic miRNAs exercise their function by
targeting tumor suppressors (42, 43). In our study, we identify
the known tumor suppressor RASSF1A (Ras association
domain family member 1 isoform A) as a direct target of the
miR-181a/b cluster in APL. miR-181 family members are the
only miRNAs that have three conserved binding sites in the
30 UTR of RASSF1A (Fig. 4A and E). RASSF1A has been found to
be epigenetically inactivated in a variety of cancers by promoter
hypermethylation, and reintroduction of RASSF1A in RASSF1Adeﬁcient tumor cells leads to the reduction of tumorigenicity
(22, 44). Because there is no RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation in APL, there must be other mechanisms how the tumor
suppressor is inactivated (23, 45). In this study, we show the
upregulation of RASSF1A protein upon ATRA treatment in NB4
cells while miR-181a/b expression is decreasing (Figs. 1A, D, K,
and L and 4A). In addition, we demonstrate that RASSF1A
protein is not regulated by arsenic trioxide, which also does not
affect miR-181a/b expression (Fig. 4B, Fig. 1I and J). Finally, we
prove by luciferase assay that repression of RASSF1A protein
occurs via direct binding of miR-181a and miR-181b to its
30 UTR (Fig. 4F), which has also been shown in hepatocellular
cancer stem cells by Meng and colleagues (46). Our luciferase
assay data in combination with our data from knockdown and
overexpression experiments of miR-181a and miR-181b ﬁrstly
show the direct repression of RASSF1A translation by the miR181a/b cluster in the background of APL (Fig. 4F–H). Furthermore, we observed the APL-speciﬁc inverse correlation of miR181a/b expression and RASSF1A protein, which could not be
seen in the other analyzed AML subgroups and healthy
donors. The proposed speciﬁcity of RASSF1A suppression by a
PML/RARa-dependent mechanism is supported by protein
expression data in AML patient samples and in PML/RARa
knock-in mice, which show reduced RASSF1A protein levels
when the miR-181a/b cluster is highly expressed (Figs. 2C and
D and 5). In addition, mRNA expression analysis of RASSF1A in
AML patient samples and healthy donors substantiates the
suggested regulation mechanism via miR-181a/b (Fig. 5B).

3422 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

These ﬁndings are supported by a recently published work by
Zare-Abdollahi and colleagues (47).
Until now, no function for RASSF1A in APL or granulocytic
differentiation has been shown. In this study, we describe
RASSF1A as an essential component of the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation network in APL. Enforced expression of
RASSF1A leads to enhanced apoptosis of NB4 cells, which conﬁrms the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in APL (Fig.
6C). In addition, reduced granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells
in consequence to RASSF1A knockdown supports the proposed
differentiation associated function of RASSF1A (Fig. 6B). It was
shown that RASSF1A is able to effectively prevent G1–S phase
transition by blocking cyclin D1 accumulation (24) and to induce
apoptosis (48). In APL, ATRA induces APL cell differentiation into
mature granulocytes and results in cell apoptosis (26). This
process involves the sequential regulation of cell-cycle regulatory
proteins, such as cyclin D1, which promotes G1–S progression
(49). In our study, we conﬁrm the ATRA-induced repression of
cyclin D1 in APL cells (Fig. 7A). We also show that overexpression
of RASSF1A leads to a dramatic repression of cyclin D1 protein
and that knockdown of RASSF1A promotes cell-cycle progression
in APL (Fig. 7B and C). Furthermore, we could demonstrate that
RASSF1A is the key mediator for miR-181a- and miR-181b–
mediated induction of cyclin D1 accompanied by cell-cycle progression in APL (Fig. 7E and F). Finally, in contrast to ATRA,
arsenic trioxide, which induces apoptosis in APL, does not affect
miR-181a/b expression and RASSF1A protein. This correlates with
the ﬁnding that arsenic trioxide does not downregulate cyclin D1
protein (50). On the basis of these ﬁndings, we claim RASSF1A as
an important factor in the granulocytic differentiation, which
prevents cyclin D1 accumulation, cell-cycle progression, and
promotes differentiation upon ATRA treatment in APL blasts.
In summary, our study highlights the clustered miR-181a and
miR-181b as important factors in the PML/RARa-associated APL.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst describing the miR181a/b target RASSF1A as an essential member of the ATRAinduced granulocytic differentiation network in APL (Fig. 7G).
Both miRNAs, transcriptional induced by PML/RARa, lead to
translational repression of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A. Its
function is restored trough repression of miR-181a/b expression
by ATRA-induced degradation of PML/RARa, which prevents
accumulation of cyclin D1 and induces cell-cycle arrest, which
results in granulocytic differentiation of APL blasts. Our data
reveal a mechanism of tumor suppressor inhibition by a microRNA cluster that seems to be highly speciﬁc for APL. Finally,
manipulation of miR-181a/b could offer novel treatment strategies in PML/RARa-associated APL.
