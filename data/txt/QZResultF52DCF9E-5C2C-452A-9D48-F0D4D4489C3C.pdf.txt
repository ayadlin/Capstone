The Changing View of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
Els M.J.J. Berns1 and David D. Bowtell2,3

Abstract
The classiﬁcation of epithelial ovarian cancer has been substantially revised, with an increased appreciation of the
cellular origins and molecular aberrations of the different histotypes. Distinct patterns of signaling-pathway
disruption are seen between and within histotypes. Large-scale genomic studies of high-grade serous cancer, the
most common histotype, have identiﬁed novel molecular subtypes that are associated with distinct biology and
clinical outcome. High-grade serous cancers are characterized by few driver point mutations but abundant DNA
copy number aberrations. Inactivation of genes associated with DNA damage repair underlies responses to platinum
and PARP inhibitors. Here we review these recent developments. Cancer Res; 72(11); 2701–4. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the ﬁfth most frequent cause of
cancer death in women in Western countries, and overall
survival rates have improved little in the last 20 to 30 years
(1). Serous, endometrioid, clear-cell, and mucinous ovarian
cancers are the 4 most common histotypes, and until recently,
these cancers were thought to arise from ovarian surface
epithelium. Pathological and molecular studies have provided
a strikingly different view of epithelial ovarian cancer in which
the majority of invasive tumors are now thought to arise from
nonovarian tissues. By examining focal premalignant lesions
and carcinoma in situ in the fallopian tubes of women with
germline BRCA1/2 mutations who were undergoing prophylactic risk-reducing surgery, investigators identiﬁed the secretory cells of the distal fallopian tube as the likely progenitor of
at least a proportion of high-grade serous cancers [HGSC (2)].
Identical mutations in TP53 were found in fallopian tube
tumors and in deposits throughout the abdomen of women
with advanced disease (2), strengthening the link between the
fallopian tube and HGSC, and helping to focus attention on the
likely progenitor cells. Studies involving DNA damage by
irradiation of explants of normal fallopian tubes showed
delayed repair of DNA double-strand breaks in the secretory
cells compared with adjacent ciliated cells, suggesting that
secretory cells are more susceptible to accumulation of mutagenic injury (3).
Previously established epidemiological and pathological
associations between endometriosis and endometrioid and
clear-cell ovarian cancer were strengthened by the identiﬁcaAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MCDaniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 2Cancer

tion of high-frequency somatic mutations in ARID1a, a chromatin-remodeling gene, in adjacent endometriotic and cancerous lesions (4). Invasive mucinous ovarian cancers, once
considered the second most common histotype, are now
thought to account for only 2% to 3% of invasive cancers, with
the remainder being metastases to the ovary, most commonly
from the gastrointestinal tract (5). Therefore, although the
actual contribution of the ovary to the spectrum of epithelial
ovarian cancers is still debated, it is now apparent that the
histotypes should be considered as distinct diseases originating from different cell types (1).
Tumor grade, a pathological index of cellular aberration,
provides additional stratiﬁcation of both serous and endometrioid cancers. Low-grade serous cancers are thought to
arise by the transformation of tumors of borderline malignancy, and activating mutations in members of the RAS
pathway (KRAS, BRAF, and ErbB2) are found in the majority
of these tumors (6). By contrast, HGSCs rarely have activating RAS pathway mutations. Their distinctive molecular
characteristics are outlined below. Recent immunohistochemical (7) and gene expression studies showed that
endometrioid cancers segregate into low-grade tumors with
frequent activating mutations in the WNT-b-catenin pathway (8) and that high-grade endometrioid cancers are
indistinguishable from HGSCs (9).

Molecular Characteristics of HGSCs
The reclassiﬁcation of epithelial ovarian cancer led to the
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc molecular events that were obscured
when the different histotypes were combined. For example,
early estimates of the TP53 mutation rate in ovarian cancer
varied widely (10), in part because many studies aggregated
different histotypes. By narrowing our focus to a speciﬁc
histotype, we were able to show that TP53 gene mutations
occur in almost 100% of HGSCs (11). Germline and somatic
mutations in BRCA1/2 and other members of a pathway that
controls homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA
double-strand breaks, such as PALB2, RAD51, RAD50, BARD1,
CHK2, and BRIP1 (12), occur much more frequently in HGSCs
than in other ovarian cancer histotypes.

Berns and Bowtell

A recent whole-exome analysis performed as part of the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study of almost 500 HGSCs
identiﬁed no new common somatic mutations in HGSCs (13)
but conﬁrmed that these tumors are dominated by widespread
DNA copy number aberrations (14). These and other ﬁndings
suggest a model in which HGSCs preferentially evolve as a
consequence of initial disruption of DNA repair, followed by
chromosomal instability, copy number change, and segregation into molecular subtypes (15). Consistent with this notion,
a hypermutator phenotype was associated with tumors arising
in a germline BRCA2 mutant background (16).
The frequent occurrence of BRCA pathway disruption in
HGSCs, clinical responses to agents that target defects in HRR
in BRCA1/2 carriers and noncarriers (17), and gene expression
studies of germline BRCA1/2 mutant and wild-type tumors (18)
suggested that most HGSCs may be BRCA-like (19). However,
it now seems that only half of HGSCs have identiﬁable mutations or methylation of BRCA pathway genes (13), which
accords well with functional studies involving the formation
of gH2Ax-positive repair foci following DNA damage of HGSC
cells (20). The molecular features of HGSCs that lack obvious
BRCA pathway disruption are still poorly understood, although
ampliﬁcation of the cell-cycle regulator CCNE1 is predominantly associated with this group (13).
A gene expression analysis of more than 300 HGSCs as part
of the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study identiﬁed distinct
molecular subtypes (21) that have been designated with neutral descriptors (C1, C2, C4, and C5) until the key pathways that
control subtype behavior become fully apparent. The 4 molecular subtypes were validated in the TCGA study (13) and are
associated with distinct clinical outcomes (22). We recently
found that ampliﬁcation and overexpression of MYCN and a
downstream pathway involving LIN28B, LET7, and the chromatin-modifying HMGA2 are speciﬁcally associated with the
C5 subtype (22), consistent with the notion that the subtypes
may reﬂect distinct patterns of oncogene activation. The TCGA
study also identiﬁed frequent disruptions of the RB, PI3K/RAS,
NOTCH, and FOXM1 pathways in HGSC, which were independent of molecular subtype (13).
Making sense of the many DNA copy-number changes in
HGSCs remains an important goal. The widespread changes in
DNA copy number involve a large number of genes at various
levels of gain or loss and frequency, such as the 8q24 locus
involving MYC, which is gained in more than 80% of cases (13).
Of interest, a remarkable similarity is seen between the copynumber proﬁles obtained from different cohorts of HGSC
patients, which are different from the pattern seen in clearcell ovarian cancer (23). The emergence of consistent patterns
of chromosomal change in HGSC patient cohorts suggests an
underlying interdependency of gains and losses in individual
tumors. For example, coampliﬁcation of CCNE1 and the 20q11
locus involving the cell-cycle regulator TPX2, among other
genes (24), supports the notion of an interaction between
certain copy-number events in HGSCs. A systematic RNA
interference screen identiﬁed a large number of genes, including the transcription factor PAX8, as being essential and
ampliﬁed in ovarian cancer cell lines (25). PAX8 is strongly
expressed in fallopian tube secretory cells and is required for

M€
ullerian system development (26). Protein expression is
detectable in almost 100% of HGSC (27). Collectively these
ﬁndings suggest PAX8 may be a lineage-speciﬁc oncogene,
similar to MITF in cutaneous melanoma.

Determinants of Response to Therapy and
Survival in HGSC
The 5-year survival rate for patients with HGSC is between
35% and 40%, and it is strongly inﬂuenced by the extent of
disease at presentation (stage) and the amount of residual
tumor following primary debulking surgery. However, considerable variation in outcome is observed among HGSC patients
matched for stage and debulking status, suggesting that other
determinants of survival are at play. Although no molecular
predictors of clinical outcome are currently in use (28), several
factors are becoming increasingly apparent. Women with a
germline mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 show higher
response rates to chemotherapy, a longer progression-free
survival, and improved overall survival compared with noncarriers (13, 16, 29, 30). Improved survival is also seen in women
with somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 but not in those with
methylation of the BRCA1 promoter (13). It seems that the
defects in HRR associated with loss of BRCA function that
create an initial susceptibility to ovarian cancer also render the
tumors sensitive to platinum-based DNA crosslinking agents.
Intragenic BRCA1/2 mutations that result in the partial restoration of defective germline alleles were observed in a
signiﬁcant fraction of tumors following platinum-based
chemotherapy and the emergence of resistance (31). The
apparently strong selective pressure for such germline BRCA
reversion underscores the importance of BRCA dysfunction in
inﬂuencing platinum sensitivity.
Although most women with HGSC have excellent responses
to chemotherapy following primary surgery, 20% to 30% of
patients relapse within 6 months of treatment. A supervised
analysis of copy-number changes in primary resistant versus
responsive HGSC patients identiﬁed CCNE1 ampliﬁcation as
the dominant chromosomal abnormality associated with
treatment failure (32). The association of CCNE1 with poor
outcome is lost, however, when the inverse correlation
between CCNE1 ampliﬁcation and BRCA inactivation is taken
into account (13). Patients with the C1 molecular subtype of
HGSC, which is characterized by a ﬂorid reactive stromal
response, also commonly fail primary treatment (32). The poor
outcome seen in patients with other solid cancers with profound stromal reactions suggests a sharing of mechanisms that
inﬂuence response to chemotherapy, perhaps associated with
poor drug uptake or with cell-adhesion–mediated drug resistance. It is becoming increasingly apparent that HGSC patients
who accumulate CD8þ T cells within the epithelial tumor
fraction have improved survival compared with those in whom
the inﬂammatory cells are predominantly in the stroma or are
few in number, or those who have abundant immune suppressive T-regulatory cells or macrophages (33).
Analysis of paired samples, collected before and after treatment, offers an important opportunity to understand the
acquisition of chemotherapy resistance (34). Using this

approach, investigators showed that HDAC4-regulated STAT1
activation (35) and DNA-PK–mediated activation of AKT (36)
inﬂuence the sensitivity of HGSC cells to platinum, providing
potential routes to reverse acquired resistance.

Therapeutic Approaches to HGSC
Although it has proved difﬁcult to advance beyond the use of
platinum-paclitaxel–based combination chemotherapy and
debulking surgery, which were introduced in the mid 1970s
(1), this is likely to change. Numerous clinical trials have
investigated the impact of platinum-based chemotherapy, the
timing and route of administration, and the scheduling of
conventional chemotherapy. A recent Japanese trial showed
impressive gains in time-to-relapse and overall survival of
HGSC patients following weekly dose-dense administration
of paclitaxel/carboplatin (37); however, this strategy has not
been shown to be effective in Caucasian populations to
date (38).
The central importance of HRR deﬁciency in HGSCs renders
these tumors sensitive to inhibition of other DNA repair
proteins, such as PARP. Through inhibition of base excision
repair, PARP inhibition forces HRR-deﬁcient cells to use errorprone nonhomologous end joining (39), which was shown to
result in selective toxicity to tumor cells and activity in clinical
trials of women with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, as
well as in a proportion of noncarriers (17). Important current
goals include the identiﬁcation of patients who are most likely
to respond to PARP inhibition and evidence of an improvement
in survival over standard regimes (28).
Although molecularly targeted agents are unlikely to replace
current therapy soon, several of these agents are showing
promise in combination with existing cytotoxics. Attenuation
of tumor angiogenesis has been explored in large phase III
clinical trials of bevacizumab, an inhibitor antibody directed
toward VEGF (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: GOG-0218,
NCT00262847; ICON7, NCT00483782; OCEANS, NCT00434642).
The patients required sustained treatment with bevacizumab
during and after the end of conventional chemotherapy to
achieve a signiﬁcant increase in time-to-relapse. Current studies suggest that maintenance on bevacizumab until disease

progression is required for patients to achieve a substantial
beneﬁt, resulting in a substantial increase in the cost of
treatment. A lack of effective predictors of response, including
whether patients with speciﬁc molecular subtypes of HGSC
would beneﬁt and a poor understanding of the determinants of
resistance, are important limitations to the use of bevacizumab
at this time.
Given the clear evidence of CyclinE1's amplicon-dependent
cellular addiction (24) as well as its druggability, this protein
represents a potentially important therapeutic target in HGSC
through inhibition of its association with cyclin-dependent
kinases, including cdk2, or targeting of CyclinE1 protein processing. In addition, because CCNE1 ampliﬁcation occurs
preferentially in HGSC without germline BRCA1/2 mutations,
it offers a molecular target in a group of patients who are less
likely to beneﬁt from new agents such as PARP inhibitors.

Conclusions
In the last few years, the view of ovarian cancer has changed
substantially. Efforts to personalize therapy have focused on
elucidating the biology of the speciﬁc subtypes. An improved
understanding of the progenitors of different histotypes,
including HGSC, is facilitating the development of mouse
models that recapitulate the human disease (40), which up to
now have been elusive. The utility of cell lines for preclinical
testing requires well-characterized/annotated lines stratiﬁed
for subtypes. Comprehensive genomic studies have revealed
many of the molecular determinants of the HGSC genome,
providing the foundation for a synthesis of the interacting
pathways that control the growth and survival of this tumor.
