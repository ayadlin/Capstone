Abstract
Exposure to the environmental toxicant arsenic, through both contaminated water and food, contributes to
significant health problems worldwide. In particular, arsenic exposure is thought to function as a carcinogen
for lung, skin, and bladder cancer via mechanisms that remain largely unknown. More recently, the Hedgehog
signaling pathway has also been implicated in the progression and maintenance of these same cancers. Based
on these similarities, we tested the hypothesis that arsenic may act in part through activating Hedgehog signaling. Here, we show that arsenic is able to activate Hedgehog signaling in several primary and established
tissue culture cells as well as in vivo. Arsenic activates Hedgehog signaling by decreasing the stability of the
repressor form of GLI3, one of the transcription factors that ultimately regulate Hedgehog activity. We also
show, using tumor samples from a cohort of bladder cancer patients, that high levels of arsenic exposure are
associated with high levels of Hedgehog activity. Given the important role Hedgehog signaling plays in the
maintenance and progression of a variety of tumors, including bladder cancer, these results suggest that arsenic exposure may in part promote cancer through the activation of Hedgehog signaling. Thus, we provide an
important insight into the etiology of arsenic-induced human carcinogenesis, which may be relevant to
millions of people exposed to high levels of arsenic worldwide. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1981–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
More than 100 million people are currently exposed to
drinking water containing inorganic arsenic at the level
above 0.13 μmol/L (10 μg/L), the maximum contaminant
level set by the WHO (1). Contaminant levels of inorganic
arsenic as high as ≥10 μmol/L can be found in drinking
water throughout the world. Chronic arsenic ingestion
causes numerous human health problems (1). In particular,
arsenic exposure has a strong association with human can-

cers (2), including those derived from the lung, skin, bladder,
and possibly other sites (1). Consistent with these findings,
chronic low-level arsenic treatment has been shown to
promote cell proliferation (3) and transform cells in vitro
(4). Although arsenic exposure clearly contributes to carcinogenesis, the underlying mechanisms have only recently been
described (1).
The secreted protein Hedgehog was first described as a key
factor in metazoan development, determining cell fate, promoting proliferation or differentiation, and acting as a survival factor or a guidance molecule (5). Emerging results
now suggest that Hedgehog signaling may also play a fundamental role in the maintenance function of adult tissues undergoing continuous proliferation and differentiation (6) perhaps
by regulating the small pool of stem/progenitor cells that regulate these processes (7). Consistent with this important role
in fetal development and adult tissue maintenance, deregulation of Hedgehog signaling leads to a variety of human cancers
(8, 9), some of which are commonly associated with arsenic
exposure. There are three mammalian Hedgehog family members, Sonic Hedgehog, Indian Hedgehog, and Desert Hedgehog,
which are thought to function primarily by engaging a common signaling pathway. These proteins, which we collectively
call Hedgehog, initiate their biological effects through binding
to the cell surface receptor Patched. Such binding relieves the
inhibitory effect of Patched on a seven-transmembrane
protein Smoothened, resulting in modulation of the GLI

transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3; refs. 10, 11). GLI1
is a pure transcriptional activator and is itself a Hedgehog target gene, the expression level of which is thought to be the
most reliable marker for Hedgehog pathway activity (12).
GLI2 and GLI3 function as both positive and negative regulators
of the Hedgehog pathway depending on their proteolytic status. Full-length GLI2 and GLI3 are transcriptional activators
(GLI-A; refs. 13, 14). However, in the absence of Hedgehog,
GLI2 and GLI3 are actively converted into partially proteolysed
transcriptional repressors (GLI-R) through a processing mechanism regulated by the proteasome (15, 16). The activity of the
full-length GLIs is also regulated by controlling their protein
stability via their complete proteosomal degradation (17). Ultimately, the overall ratio between GLI-A and GLI-R defines
the levels of Hedgehog pathway activation (10, 11).
As there are many similarities in outcomes between individuals chronically exposed to arsenic and those harboring
mutations that result in deregulated Hedgehog signaling
(1, 8, 9), we hypothesized that arsenic might act to regulate
Hedgehog signaling. Here, we provide evidence suggesting
that arsenic exposure results in constitutive Hedgehog signaling and that this activation occurs at concentrations relevant
to human exposure. Moreover, using an established bladder
cancer patient cohort, we show a strong positive association
between arsenic exposure and high-level Hedgehog signaling, underscoring the physiologic relevance of our findings.
This is the first report implicating the Hedgehog signaling
pathway as a physiologically relevant biological target for
arsenic, which may begin to explain some of the underlying carcinogenesis found in humans exposed to environmental arsenic.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and arsenic treatment. All cells
were grown and maintained as described previously (18–20).
Cell growth media used in these experiments have undetectable levels of background arsenic (data not shown). Sonic
Hedgehog conditioned medium was collected from HEK293
cells stably expressing murine Sonic Hedgehog (21). Conditioned medium from the parental HEK293 cells was used
as the negative control. For the experiments involving chronic
arsenic treatment, sodium arsenite (Sigma) was added to
NIH3T3 cells to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, or 5 μmol/L
for 1 to 8 weeks. For other assays, sodium arsenite was added
to cells for 24 h. Cyclopamine (Toronto Research Chemicals)
or vehicle control (DMSO) was added to 8-week-old chronic
arsenic-treated NIH3T3 cells in low serum medium (0.5%
serum) for 24 h before harvesting cells for RNA isolation.
Hedgehog reporter assays were done using a GLIBS-Luc reporter construct or a miniTK-luciferase control plasmid as
described previously (22).
Clonogenic cell survival assay. NIH3T3 cells were seeded
into six-well dishes at 500 per well and allowed to grow overnight in normal growth medium. Cells were then exposed to
0 to 20 μmol/L sodium arsenite for 24 h and washed once
with PBS followed by the addition of fresh growth medium.

After 5 days post-arsenic treatment, cells were stained with
0.4% (w/v) Giemsa dye (in 70% methanol; Sigma) for 90 min.
Clonogenicity was defined as colony numbers formed as a
percent of control untreated cells.
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time
PCR. RNA was extracted using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center) followed by a column cleanup step using a
RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg total
RNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was done using a
7500 Fast Real-time PCR System with inventoried Taqman
gene expression assay probes (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (22).
Immunoblot. GLI1 was enriched from one confluent
150 mm dish of cells using Sepharose beads conjugated with
a Gli-binding oligonucleotide, or nonspecific oligonucleotide,
as described previously (16). In all other cases, proteins were
directly extracted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunobloting was done as described previously (23). Antibodies
used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal GLI1 (affinity-purified,
raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino
acids residue 802-817 of human GLI1, which has no homology with GLI2 or GLI3, and characterized in Supplementary
Fig. S1), rabbit polyclonal GLI3 (24), and mouse monoclonal
αTUBULIN (Calbiochem). In certain cases, densitometry
analysis was done on developed X-ray films using ImageQuant (version 5.2). The quantitation results were expressed
as ratios of the intensity score of the anti-GLI3 bands versus
the corresponding intensity score of the anti-TUBULIN band.
The ratio was used to compare the relative GLI3 levels with
or without chronic arsenic exposure. The immunoblot for
αTUBULIN was used as a loading control in all cases.
Mice. All mouse studies were done in accordance with the
policies of the Dartmouth Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Seven-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson
Laboratory) were housed on an AIN-76A diet (ad libitum;
Harlan-Teklad) and Carefresh bedding in autoclaved cages.
After 2 weeks, these mice were given drinking water (ad libitum,
changed weekly) with or without addition of 1.3 μmol/L sodium arsenite for 5 weeks as described previously (25). Tissues were collected from these mice and stored in RNA later
(Ambion) before RNA extraction in Tri Reagent using a motordriven homogenizer.
Bladder cancers and GLI1 immunohistochemistry. The
study group was composed of newly diagnosed, histologically
confirmed bladder cancer patients on whom we obtained the
original diagnostic formalin-fixed tumor block. Subjects were
interviewed as part of case-control study that involved testing a tap water sample from the participants’ homes for arsenic concentrations using high-resolution inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (26). Diagnostic slides
underwent a standardized histopathology re-review by the
study pathologist, who selected the tumor block and outlined
regions for cutting 0.6 mm tissue cores for tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemistry was done as described previously (27) using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal GLI1
antibody (1:300) characterized in Supplementary Fig. S1.
The GLI1 score from each bladder tumor sample was

Arsenic Activates Hedgehog Signaling

examined by a research pathologist, who was blinded to the
arsenic exposure and tumor invasiveness data sets. The GLI1
scoring criteria were based on an estimate of the percentage
of tumor cells with nuclear GLI1 staining: <1%, 1% to 5%, 5%
to 25%, and 25% to 50% (Supplementary Fig. S2). No tumors
with >50% nuclear GLI1 staining have been observed. Although we noted that the intensity of nuclear GLI1 staining
appeared to positively correlate with the percentage of positively stained cells, this observation was not used as a factor
for scoring. A second GLI1 antisera (Abcam) was used to
confirm these immunohistochemistry results (Supplementary Fig. S1). The specificity of this second antisera was characterized previously (22).
Statistics. All experiments were independently done at
least three times. Statistical significance was determined by
Student’s t test. For the analysis of tissue microarrays, we
compared the proportion of tumors that stained positively
for GLI1 among those with high versus low water arsenic
concentrations (above and below the median for the study)
using a χ2 test. In all analyses, two-tailed P values ≤ 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
To test the hypothesis that arsenic activates Hedgehog signaling, we first evaluated the ability of sodium arsenite to activate a well-characterized Hedgehog reporter construct in
cultured cells originating from several tissues that are known
arsenic targets (1, 28). This Hedgehog reporter construct was
transiently transfected into primary bovine aorta endothelial
cells (BAEC) and immortalized bronchial epithelial cells
(BEAS 2B) followed by arsenic treatment for 24 h. Sodium
arsenite (1 μmol/L; 77 μg/L) gave rise to a statistically significant 1.7-fold increase in Hedgehog activity in both cell types,
whereas treatment with 5 μmol/L arsenic resulted in a 2.1- or
8.7-fold increase in Hedgehog activity in BEAS 2B or BAEC,
respectively (Fig. 1A). The activity of a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase construct was not significantly
changed in these arsenic-exposed cells (data not shown),
consistent with these doses of arsenic not inducing a general
toxic effect on these cells. Next, we examined the ability of
arsenic to activate Hedgehog signaling in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, a cell line commonly used to study Hedgehog signaling (18). We first determined the tolerable doses of sodium
arsenite for NIH3T3 cells using a clonogenic assay, in which
the ability of arsenic-treated cells to proliferate and form
colonies was tested. The clonogenicity of NIH3T3 cells appears unaffected when treated with up to 5 μmol/L sodium
arsenite, with an overall IC50 of ∼9.5 μmol/L (Fig. 1B). Similar to the results observed with BAEC and BEAS 2B cells,
5 μmol/L arsenic activated Hedgehog signaling 2.6-fold
above background in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1C, black column).
The activation of the Hedgehog reporter gene by arsenic appears specific to Hedgehog pathway activation, as a similar
construct lacking GLI-binding sites failed to respond to arsenic exposure (Fig. 1C, gray column). These results suggested that activation of Hedgehog signaling was induced
by arsenic and that this activation could occur at arsenic

to human exposure (1).

signaling when cells were exposed to low levels of arsenic in
a chronic manner, which is thought to more closely mimic

human exposure in arsenic-contaminated areas (1, 2). NIH3T3
cells were cultured either in standard growth medium or the
same medium containing 0.5, 1, or 5 μmol/L sodium arsenite
for 1 to 8 weeks. As an endogenous indicator of Hedgehog
pathway activation, the expression of the Hedgehog target
gene GLI1 was examined in cells treated with arsenic for 1, 3,
or 5 weeks using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionPCR assay. After 1 week of arsenic exposure, 1 and 5 μmol/L
arsenic-treated cells showed a modest increase in the expression of GLI1, 1.4- and 2.2-fold, respectively, relative to control
cells that were not exposed to arsenic (Fig. 2A). This activation
became more robust as the time of arsenic treatment increased. Interestingly, although 1-week exposure of cells to
0.5 μmol/L arsenic did not cause any increase in GLI1 induction, longer exposure (≥3 weeks) resulted in a 1.7-fold GLI1 induction. This concentration of arsenic is lower than the
maximum contaminant level (0.63 μmol/L) allowed in potable
water in the United States before 2002 (2). Thus, GLI1 expression was activated by chronic arsenic treatment in a doseand time-dependent manner. To strengthen this analysis, we
examined the expression of a panel of Hedgehog target genes

in NIH3T3 cells exposed to sodium arsenite for 8 weeks. Thispanel consists of those genes normally upregulated by
Hedgehog [GLI1, patched 1 (PTCH1), patched 2 (PTCH2),
and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1); refs. 5, 29, 30] as well
as a gene that is repressed by Hedgehog in cultured fibroblasts
[secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2); ref. 31]. Four of five
of these genes (GLI1, PTCH1, SPP1, and SFRP2) showed dosedependent changes consistent with activation of Hedgehog
signaling (Fig. 2B). Arsenic effects on NIH3T3 cells were verified by a dose-dependent induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO1)
expression, which is a well-established arsenic target (32). As
these analyzed genes are all well-characterized Hedgehog target genes, their expression serve as physiologically relevant
markers of Hedgehog pathway activation. We also independently verified the ability of chronic low-dose arsenic to activate Hedgehog target genes in a pluripotent mesenchymal
mouse embryonic cell line C3H/10T1/2 (data not shown).
To further validate the observed arsenic-induced changes
in GLI1 expression, we next examined the change in GLI1
protein in cells chronically exposed to arsenic. To detect
endogenous GLI1 in lysates of these NIH3T3 cells, we first

input. D, 9-wk-old C57BL/6J male mice were given drinking water with or without 1.3 μmol/L sodium arsenite for 5 wk followed by harvesting
of RNA from the kidneys. Real-time PCR was done to determine GLI1 expression relative to expression of 18S rRNA. Expression of GLI1 was
set to 1 in control mice that were not exposed to arsenic via drinking water. Six control mice and six arsenic-exposed mice were used

Arsenic Activates Hedgehog Signaling

enriched for GLI1 using Sepharose beads conjugated with
oligonucleotides encoding a defined GLI-binding site (16)
followed by immunoblotting with GLI1 antisera. Using this
approach, we observed a dramatic increase in GLI1 protein
in response to increasing amount of arsenic exposure, with
the strongest induction occurring in 5 μmol/L arsenicexposed cells (Fig. 2C, lane 4). Sepharose beads conjugated
with nonspecific DNA oligonucleotides were used to control
the specificity of these pull-downs (Fig. 2C, lane 5).
Our findings were also confirmed in a mouse model of
chronic arsenic exposure (25). Nine-week-old C57BL/6J mice
were exposed to 1.3 μmol/L sodium arsenite for 5 weeks in
their drinking water. These animals were sacrificed and various tissues were harvested. Total RNA was extracted from
these tissues, and the expression of GLI1 was analyzed by realtime reverse transcription-PCR. A statistically significant increase in the relative expression of GLI1 was observed from
the kidneys of arsenic-exposed mice but not from other tissues
examined (Fig. 2D; data not shown). This arsenic-induced increase in Hedgehog signaling is likely an underestimate of the
extent of activation, as only a limited group of adult cells in any
tissue may be capable of elaborating a Hedgehog response.
We did not observe any signs of arsenic-induced toxicity in
these animals over these 5-week studies (data not shown).
Thus, these results suggest that chronic arsenic exposure is
also able to activate Hedgehog signaling in vivo at least in a
subset of tissues.

www.aacrjournals.org

To begin to understand the mechanism of Hedgehog
pathway activation on arsenic exposure, we determined if
the arsenic activation of Hedgehog signaling required
Smoothened function, which is a key regulator in the
Hedgehog pathway (5). Consistent with the pivotal role of
Smoothened in Hedgehog signaling, several small-molecule
Smoothened modulators have been described (33). Moreover, Smoothened appears to be the most common smallmolecule target identified in numerous high-throughput
screens, making it a likely arsenic target. Somewhat surprisingly, the Smoothened antagonist cyclopamine was unable to
attenuate arsenic-induced Hedgehog signaling in NIH3T3
cells (Fig. 3A). Cyclopamine decreased overall GLI1 expression in both chronic arsenic-exposed cells and control cells
to a similar extent (data not shown). Thus, the fold induction
of GLI1 expression by arsenic was not inhibited. As a control
for the effectiveness of this drug, Sonic Hedgehog induced
GLI1 expression was completely abolished by cyclopamine
(Supplementary Fig. S3). This result argued for a dispensable
role of Smoothened in arsenic-induced Hedgehog signaling, thus ruling out an indirect contribution of Hedgehog
in arsenic-mediated pathway activation. Hedgehog signaling ultimately results in changes in the levels and activation
status of GLI1-3 (11). Thus, we hypothesized that arsenic
might be activating Hedgehog signaling by modulating
the processing of GLI2 or GLI3. Interestingly, arsenic attenuated the level of GLI3-R in a dose-dependent manner but

had little effect on the level of GLI3-A (Fig. 3B and C). Because arsenic treatment also modestly induced the expression of GLI3 (Supplementary Fig. S4), we speculate that
GLI3-R might be selectively degraded on arsenic exposure.
Consistent with this speculation, arsenic is known to regulate
the stability of other proteins in both proteosomal- and lysosomal-dependent manner (20, 34). Loss of GLI3-R in the context

1986

Cancer Res; 70(5) March 1, 2010

of similar GLI3-A levels would result in a net increase in
Hedgehog activity, similar to what we have observed. However,
the effect of arsenic on GLI3 appears different from the way
Hedgehog regulates GLI3 in these cells. Hedgehog inhibited
GLI3 protein processing into GLI3-R and also decreases GLI3
mRNA at the same time (24, 35), resulting in a loss of both
GLI3-A and GLI3-R (Fig. 3B and D). We were unable to detect
endogenous GLI2 from these cells. However, the decreases in
GLI2 transcript observed in response to arsenic are consistent
with GLI3-A driving arsenic-mediated activation of Hedgehog
signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4).
A series of epidemiologic studies have shown an association between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer (1, 36, 37).
Moreover, Hedgehog signaling has also been implicated in
bladder cancer progression (38, 39). Thus, to determine a
putative linkage between chronic arsenic exposure and
Hedgehog signaling in carcinogenesis, we used tumors from
a large population-based bladder cancer patient cohort (26).
We examined GLI1 protein level as a readout for Hedgehog
pathway activity in 265 bladder cancers cases using a quantitative immunohistochemistry protocol that estimated
the percentage of tumor cells with nuclear GLI1 staining
(Fig. 4A). We defined bladder cancers as negative for GLI1
staining if <1% of cancer cells contained nuclear GLI1, whereas
>1%, >5%, and >25% nuclear GLI1 delineated different relative
levels of GLI1 positivity. The number of cases with each GLI1
score is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Household tap
water arsenic concentrations from 97% of the study subjects
were measured, ranging from 0.004 to 160.5 μg/L, with the
median oncentration being 0.326 μg/L. We classified patients
into two categories of “high” or “low” water arsenic exposure
using the median arsenic concentration as the cut-point. In
general, the numbers of GLI1-positive tumors were higher in
patients with high arsenic exposure, whereas GLI1-negative
tumors resided more in the low arsenic category (Fig. 4B).
For example, when using the highest level of GLI1 quantitation
observed (>25%) as the definition of GLI1 positivity, 22 bladder
tumors were positive among patients with high water arsenic
levels versus 9 among those with low levels (P = 0.0087; Fig. 4B).
We also examined the distribution of GLI1-positive cancers in
two major clinical categories, noninvasive and invasive bladder cancers, as these two tumor types have different clinical
management and prognostic criteria (40). Seventy-one percent of the cancer cohort we used consisted of noninvasive
tumors, with the remaining samples being invasive tumors.
We observed that a higher percentage of GLI1-positive cancers
were noninvasive regardless of their classification of GLI1
positivity (Fig. 4C). In particular, there were 3-fold more
GLI1-positive tumors (44% versus 14%) in the noninvasive
category when only tumors with highest GLI1 positivity were
taken into account. These results suggest that activation of
Hedgehog signaling by arsenic may play a preferential role
in the formation of noninvasive bladder cancers. Indeed, the
association between GLI1 positivity and arsenic exposure
was also more pronounced in noninvasive tumors compared
with invasive tumors (data not shown). Thus, these results
suggest a highly significant positive association between
the levels of arsenic exposure and Hedgehog pathway

Arsenic Activates Hedgehog Signaling

activity in bladder cancer, showing the relevance of this work
to human health.

Discussion
We show here that the environmental toxicant arsenic activates the Hedgehog signaling pathway. The activation of
this important signaling pathway requires levels of arsenic
relevant to human exposure and occurs in various cell types
in vitro as well as in vivo. Activation of Hedgehog signaling
occurs in response to acute and chronic arsenic exposure,
in a manner that is time and dose dependent, and via a
mechanism that does not appear to affect cell viability. The
chronic effects of arsenic are particularly relevant to human
disease, as most arsenic-related health concerns occur in individuals exposed to environmental levels of arsenic for a
long period (1, 2). We suggest a model whereby arsenic activates Hedgehog signaling by targeting GLI3-R for proteolytic
degradation, in a manner that appears independent of
Smoothened. Our results also show a strong association between exposure to arsenic and activation of high-level
Hedgehog signaling in a cohort of bladder cancer patients,
particularly those with noninvasive bladder cancers, showing
the significance of our findings to human health.
Although arsenic is able to activate Hedgehog signaling in
many cell types, the level of activation observed is relatively
low compared with those initiated by Hedgehog (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, constitutive low-level Hedgehog activation over long periods might contribute to significant health
problems as illustrated in individuals diagnosed with Gorlin’s
syndrome (41). These individuals harbor loss of function mutations in one copy of PTCH1, which results in constitutive
low-level activation of Hedgehog signaling (42). These individuals exhibit an increased risk for several health problems,
including certain types of cancer. Chronic exposure to arsenic
also results in an increased risk to a variety of tumors, including those derived from skin, lung, and bladder (1). Our results
support the hypothesis that chronic activation of Hedgehog
signaling by arsenic might contribute to the development of
a subset of these tumors. Activation of Hedgehog signaling
is thought to act as a survival factor in tumor cells, with
the extent of Hedgehog pathway activation approximating
tumor progression (43). Recent evidence has also suggested
that ectopic Hedgehog activation is important to create the
microenvironment required for efficient tumor growth (44).
Consistent with the frequent requirement of Hedgehog activity
in carcinogenesis, the Hedgehog target gene GLI1 is itself an
oncogene. Overexpression of GLI1 results in a transformed
phenotype in vitro (45) and is sufficient to drive the formation
of many cancers when overexpressed in animal models, including those associated with arsenic exposure (17, 46, 47).
Therefore, we speculate that the ability of arsenic to function as a carcinogen might act in part through its ability to
activate Hedgehog signaling, helping to create a microenvironment permissive to tumor development.
Urine is the major route of arsenic excretion in humans,
making the bladder a susceptible target for the adverse effects of arsenic (1). Several epidemiologic studies have sug-

gested an increased risk of bladder cancer with chronic
arsenic exposure (1, 36, 37). However, the mechanism underlying this increased risk remains unknown. Our results suggest that activation of Hedgehog signaling by arsenic might
contribute to the etiology of arsenic related bladder cancers.
It has been suggested previously that Hedgehog signaling
may contribute to the development of bladder cancers
(38, 39). Deletions in chromosome 9q are the most common
genetic alteration and earliest marker for bladder cancers
(48). Noticeably, PTCH1 resides in the region of 9q often lost
in human bladder cancers (38, 48). Furthermore, gene amplification of a region of chromosome 12q13-q15, which encodes GLI1, has also been found in a subset of bladder
cancers (49). Interestingly, loss of PTCH1 and amplification
of GLI1 would all result in Hedgehog pathway activation. Consistent with the Hedgehog pathway playing an important role
in the progression of bladder cancer, PTCH1 heterozygous
mice exhibit a predisposition to carcinogen-induced bladder
cancer (50). We have shown here that GLI1 levels are elevated
in ∼75% of bladder cancers (Supplementary Table S1; 198 of
265 cases) and that an environmental toxicant known to function as a risk factor for bladder cancer can also activate
Hedgehog signaling, albeit through a different mechanism.
Combined, these results suggest that the Hedgehog signaling
pathway plays an important role in bladder cancer progression and that its activation can occur via distinct mechanisms: loss of PTCH1, amplification of GLI1, or degradation of
GLI3-R in response to chronic exposure to arsenic.
In conclusion, our study provides for the first time evidence that links activation of the Hedgehog pathway with arsenic exposure. This pathway activation occurs in both acute
and chronic manners and occurs at environmentally relevant
levels of arsenic. Furthermore, we show that arsenic exposure
correlates with high-level Hedgehog activation in bladder
cancer samples isolated from a large cohort of such patients.
Thus, high-level Hedgehog signaling may provide a diagnostic marker for those bladder cancer patients exposed to arsenic and provides a novel mechanism of how arsenic might
function in carcinogenesis.
