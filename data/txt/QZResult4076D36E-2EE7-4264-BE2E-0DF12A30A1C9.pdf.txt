ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world, and
finding novel agents and strategies for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer is of
urgent need. Curcumin is a well-known natural product with anti-cancer ability, but is
limited by its poor chemical stability. In this study, an analog of curcumin with high
chemical stability, WZ35, was designed and evaluated for its anti-cancer effects and
underlying mechanisms against human gastric cancer. WZ35 showed much stronger
anti-proliferative effects than curcumin, accompanied by dose-dependent induction
of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, our data
showed that WZ35 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the
activation of both JNK-mitochondrial and ER stress apoptotic pathways and eventually
cell apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. Blockage of ROS production totally reversed WZ35induced JNK and ER stress activation as well as cancer cell apoptosis. In vivo, WZ35
showed a significant reduction in SGC-7901 xenograft tumor size in a dose-dependent
manner. Taken together, this work provides a novel anticancer candidate for the
treatment of gastric cancer, and importantly, reveals that increased ROS generation
might be an effective strategy in human gastric cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

advanced gastric cancer is an important issue because the
majority of patients with gastric cancer develop metastases
during the course of their disease[3, 4]. However, severe
side effects and complications such as hematological
and gastrointestinal toxicities of current anticancer drugs
become major problems in the clinical setting, which
highlights the urgent need for novel effective and less
toxic therapeutic approaches[5, 6].
Curcumin, a yellow compound isolated from
the rhizome of the herb Curcuma longa L, has been
demonstrated as a multifunctional bioactive natural
product[7]. It also displays great potential as a
chemopreventive and therapeutic agent due to its ability to

Gastric cancer is the fourth most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated death in the world[1]. This aggressive disease
continues to be a major public health issue worldwide.
Surgery is the mainly curative treatment for localized
gastric cancer. However, even after complete resection,
more than half of patients with locally advanced tumors
will recur, and fewer than 40% patients survive beyond 3
years[2]. The high risk of relapse after surgery has led to
a search for strategies to prevent relapse and to improve
survival for gastric cancer patients. Chemotherapy in

negatively modulate cancer-related biomarkers and inhibit
the proliferation of tumor cells but retain pharmacological
safety profile in vivo[8-10]. Various signaling pathways
and molecular targets have been reported to be involved
in the anti-cancer effects of curcumin[11, 12]. However,
clinical studies have shown that curcumin is less
efficacious in human because over 80% of this compound
does not reach systemic circulation, but rather is rapidly
excreted[13]. In an attempt to retain curcumin’s favorable
medicinal properties and safety profile while increase its
potency, chemical modifications on curcumin have been
paid much attentions[14]. Previously, our lab designed
and synthesized a several mono-carbonyl analogs of
curcumin (MACs) via deletion of β-diketone moiety, and
we have demonstrated that these MACs not only enhanced
the chemical stability in vitro but also significantly
improved pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo[15]. Then,
anti-cancer bio-screenings have been performed on these
MACs, among which, a new compound, 1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-5-(2-nitrophenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one
(WZ35), showed particular anti-cancer potency against
human gastric cancer and was chosen to evaluate the
underlying mechanisms.
Here, our observations demonstrated that chemically
stable WZ35 can induce G2/M phase arrest and cell

apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, via activating ROSdependent ER stress and JNK mitochondrial pathways,
blockage of ROS production by specific inhibitor totally
abolished the anti-cancer effects of WZ35. WZ35 also
exhibited good anticancer ability in vivo. These studies
suggest that WZ35 could be a potential candidate for the
treatment of gastric cancer.

RESULTS
WZ35 was more stable than curcumin in vitro
The structure and synthesis of WZ35 are shown in
Figure 1A. Due to the deletion of the β-diketone moiety
in the molecular structure, we hypothesize that WZ35
may possess a more stable structure in vitro. Firstly, we
tested the chemical stability of WZ35 and curcumin in
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) using absorption spectrum
assay. As shown in Figure 1B, the UV-visible absorption
spectrum of curcumin displayed an intense peak with an
absorption maximum close to 425 nm, and the absorption
intensity of curcumin spectra decreases significantly in
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with time. After 25-minute

WZ35 effectively suppressed the proliferation and
invasion of human gastric cancer cells

incubation in the phosphate buffer, curcumin lost more
than 45% of its original intensity, while WZ35 showed
no degradation under the same condition (Figure 1B).
Then, we tested the levels of WZ35 and curcumin in cell
cultural medium using the HPLC method to compare their
stability in medium. Figure 1C showed the concentrationtime profiles of WZ35 and curcumin in cultural medium.
After a 4-hour incubation period, curcumin underwent
rapid degradation in the medium and more than 90% of
curcumin degraded, while more than 50% of the original
WZ35 content was retained in the medium. These data
suggested that a chemical modification in curcumin
attenuated its degradation in vitro.

We first determined the effect of WZ35 and
curcumin on cell viability of three human gastric cancer
cell lines, SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MGC-803, by MTT
assay. As show in Figure 2A, treated with WZ35 for 24
h significantly induced cell death in a dose-dependent
manner in the three gastric cancer cells with IC50 = 3.5,
3.7, and 4.3 μM, respectively. In contrast, only a small
percentage of cell death (11.2%) was found in normal
human liver HL-7702 cells after treated with 10 μM

increasing doses of WZ35 or curcumin (1.25-20 µM) for 24h, respectively. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and the IC50 values
were calculated. (C) Dynamic monitoring of SGC-7901 cells proliferation. SGC-7901 cells were seeded on laminin-coated plates of an
ACEA RT-CES system at a density of 10,000/well and were continuously monitored up to 85 h. At the time point of 30 h, WZ35 at 0.4, 2.0
or 10 μM and vehicle control DMSO were added into the corresponding wells (indicated by color and arrow). (D) WZ35 treatment induced
increased apoptotic morphology in MGC-803 cells compared with curcumin. MGC-803 cells were treated with WZ35 (2.5 or 10 µM) or
curcumin (20 µM) for 24 h. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope after Hoechst 33258 staining. (E) SGC-7901
cells (10,000/well) and WZ35 (2.5 or 10 µM) or curcumin (20 µM) were added at the same time to the upper compartment of the chamber
(pre-coated with diluted Matrigel) in 200 μL serum-free medium, and 500 μL culture medium was added below the chamber. After 24 h of
incubation at 37°C, invasive cells stuck to the lower transwell surfaces were fixed and stained with crystal violet, their number quantified
with microscopy.

WZ35 for 24 h. In addition, curcumin at the same
concentrations showed slight inhibition against the three
gastric cancer cell lines (Figure 2B). To further analyze
the anti-proliferative effect of WZ35, we used the RTCES system to monitor cell number and cell activity in
WZ35-treated SGC-7901 cells. As shown in Figure 2C,
WZ35 treatment strongly suppressed the proliferation of
SGC-7901 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At about 6
h after WZ35 addition, SGC-7901 cells started to undergo
death or apoptosis. Further, morphological changes were
determined using DAPI staining in MGC-803 cells.
Figure 2D revealed that treatment with WZ35 resulted

in a concentration dependent increase in the number of
apoptotic cells, and WZ35 showed much stronger proapoptotic effects than curcumin. Since the invasion ability
of cancer cells is critical for cancer development, we next
examined the effect of curcumin and WZ35 on inhibition
of invasion in SGC-7901 cells. Figure 2E showed that
WZ35 treatment significantly reduced the invasion ability
of SGC-7901 cells, while curcumin at 20 μM only showed
a marginal effect. These results suggest that WZ35,
without significant toxicity to normal cells, may possess
much more potent anti-cancer ability than curcumin in
gastric cancer.

Cdc2 in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 3C and 3D). Consistent
with the flow cytometry outcomes, curcumin at 20 μM
only showed slight effects on the expression of these
proteins. These data suggests that the inhibition of cell
proliferation by WZ35 may be partly associated with the
induction of G2/M phase arrest.

Three gastric cancer cell lines were treated with
WZ35 for 24 h, followed by the cell cycle determination
by flow cytometry. The results in Figure 3A and 3B
showed that WZ35 dose-dependently induced G2/M
arrest in the three cancer cells, while no significant G2/M
arrest could be observed in the curcumin-treated group.
The western blot analysis revealed that treatment with
WZ35 also dose-dependently inhibited the expression of
cell cycle-related proteins such as Cyclin B1, MDM-2, and

propidium iodide (PI) staining assay. As shown in Figure
4A and 4B, all of three gastric cancer cell lines have
shown a concentration-dependent apoptosis after a 24 h
treatment with WZ35, while curcumin at 20 μM had no
significant effect on these cell lines. Then we determined
the levels of apoptosis-related proteins in SGC-7901
cells treated with WZ35. Figure 4C and 4D showed that
treatment with WZ35 for 24 h dose-dependently activated
caspase-3/PARP pathway and increased the level of
cleaved caspase-3/PARP, suggesting that WZ35-induced
SGC-7901 cells apoptosis may be associated to caspase-3/
PARP pathway activation.

2 and a concomitant increase in Bax. In addition, the
expression of p53, which has been reported to drive the
expression of several proapoptotic proteins such as Bax
and Bad[17], was also increased by WZ35 treatment in a
dose-dependent manner. In comparison, curcumin at 20
μM only showed slightly effects on Bcl-2 family proteins.
Subsequently, SGC-7901 cells were pre-treated with the
specific JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 20 μM) for 1 h and then
exposed to WZ35 for 1 h. The result in Figure 5D showed
that WZ35-induced JNK phosphorylation was effectively
reversed by the SP600125, and, the JNK inhibitor also
attenuated WZ35-induced increase in cleaved caspase-3
and decrease in Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest
that WZ35-induced SGC-7901 cells apoptosis is at least
partly mediated by JNK-mitochondrial pathway.
In addition to mitochondrial pathway, ER stress
also plays an important role in the initiation of curcumininduced apoptosis[18]. Thus, we next examined the
expressions of ER stress-related proteins, such as
transcription factor 4 (ATF4), transcription factor 6
(ATF6), X-box binding proteins 1 (XBP-1), and C/EBPhomologous protein (CHOP) in WZ35-treated SGC-7901
cells. The time-course result indicated that WZ35 (10 μM)
could activate ER stress. The protein levels of ATF4, ATF6
and XBP-1 reached the peak at 6 h after treatment, and
CHOP peaked after 12 h treatment (Figure 6A). WZ35
also showed dose-dependent activation of these four
protein expressions (Figure 6B and 6C). In addition, no

Both JNK-mitochondrial and ER stress pathways
are involved in WZ35-induced apoptosis
The next step is to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of the anti-cancer effects of WZ35. SGC7901 cells were used for the subsequent studies. We first
found that WZ35 treatment significantly activated all of
three pathways of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK, and p38,
and their phosphorylation all peaked at approximately 1 h
after WZ35 treatment (Figure 5A). We then determined
the roles of JNK, ERK, and p38 in WZ35-induced cell
apoptosis using specific small-molecule inhibitors.
Before treated with WZ35, SGC-7901 cells were pretreated with JNK inhibitor SP600125, ERK inhibitor
PD98059, or p38 inhibitor SB203580, respectively, for
1h. The results in Figure 5B showed that PD98059 or
SB203580 alone did not alter the cell viability, but JNK
inhibitor SP600125 can partially attenuated WZ35reduced cell death, indicating that only JNK activation
was associated with WZ35-induced cell death. JNK has
been well known as a regulator in mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway[16]. We therefore examined the effects of WZ35
on Bcl-2 family proteins using western blot assay. As
shown in Figure 5C, SGC-7901 cells exposed to WZ35
showed a concentration-dependent reduction of BclFigure 5: WZ35 activates JNK-mitochondrial

significant increase in the expression of ER stress-related
proteins could be observed in cells treated with 20 μM
curcumin. We then found that JNK blockage by SP600125
could not affect WZ35-induced ATF4 expression,
indicating that WZ35-induced ER stress is independent on
JNK activation (Figure 6D). CHOP has been considered as
a marker of ER stress-induced apoptosis[19]. To further
confirm the key role of ER stress in the induction of
SGC-7901 cells apoptosis by WZ35, we constructed the
siRNA of CHOP gene for silencing CHOP expression in
SGC-7901 cells. After transfected with CHOP siRNA,
CHOP expression was significantly reduced in WZ35-

treated cells compared to the vector-control cells (Figure
6E). Furthermore, Figure 6F showed that when CHOP
expression in SGC-7901 cells was silenced, cell apoptosis
induced by WZ35 was significantly reduce, indicating that
WZ35-induced cell apoptosis is at least partly mediated by
ER stress pathway.

ROS generation is the upstream regulator of
WZ35-induced apoptosis

anti-tumor activity than curcumin. In addition, there is no
significant difference in body weight change among the
vehicle group and WZ35-treated groups, suggesting that
WZ35 exhibits no significant toxicity within the 10-day
treatment (Figure 8D). Western blot analyses of the tumor
tissues revealed that WZ35 treatment increased the levels
of CHOP and cleaved caspase-3 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 8E-8F). Ki-67 staining on tumor tissues
showed that Ki-67 expression was inhibited by WZ35
administration in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8G).
Consistent with the tumor size outcomes, WZ35 showed
stronger ability in altering CHOP, caspase-3 and Ki-67
profiles in tumor tissues (Figure 8E-8G). These data show
that WZ35 exhibits potent anti-tumor activity and high
safety in vivo.

Previous studies have reported that ROS
generation could trigger cell apoptosis via activating both
mitochondrial and ER stress pathways[20, 21]. Curcumin
has been found to increase ROS generation and induce
oxidative stress in several cancer cell lines[22, 23].
Therefore, we determined the production of intracellular
ROS in WZ35-treated and untreated cells by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 7A, treatment with WZ35
for 30 min in SGC-7901 cells caused a dose-dependent
increase in DCF-reactive ROS. To identify the role of ROS
in mediating WZ35’s anti-cancer effects, a ROS inhibitor
NAC was used, which is commonly used to inhibit
ROS production and test ROS inducers, despite some
recent studies mentioning that effects of NAC in other
pathways[24, 25]. As shown in Figure 7B, pre-treated with
the NAC for 2h significantly inhibited the WZ35-induced
ROS production. Using a fluorescent probe specific for
individual species of ROS, we found that nitric oxide was
induced by WZ35 in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 7C). Cotreatment with NAC fully reversed the WZ35-induced
increase in nitric oxide (Figure 7D). Interestingly, it was
found that NAC almost completely abolished SGC-7901
cells death induced by WZ35 (Figure 7E). Similar results
were observed in the cell apoptosis assay detected by flow
cytometry (Figure 7F). These results verified that ROS
production mediated WZ35-induced cell death. Further,
we tested the effect of the ROS inhibitor NAC on WZ35induced activation of ER stress, JNK/Bcl-2, and caspase-3
cascades in SGC-7901 cells by western blot analysis. As
shown in Figure 7G, WZ35-induced changes in JNK
phosphorylation, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 cleavage
were all reversed by NAC pretreatment. Also, NAC
pretreatment significantly blocked the overexpression of
ATF4, ATF6, XBP-1, and CHOP in WZ35-treated SGC7901 cells (Figure 7H). These results suggest that ROS
induction mediates WZ35-activated apoptotic pathways
and is critical upstream regulator in WZ35’s anti-cancer
activity.

DISCUSSION
Various chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin,
5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin have been used to treat gastric
cancer[26]. Unfortunately, all of these anticancer drugs
affect not only pathological tumor cells, but also normal
cells[5, 6]. Therefore, the search for new chemopreventive
and antitumor agents that are more effective but less toxic
has become a matter of great interest.
WZ35 is the one of mono-carbonyl analog of
curcumin designed by our group and shows higher
chemical stability than curcmin in both PH7.4 phosphate
buffer and cell culture medium (Figure 1B and 1C). As
a result, a high stability and persistent concentration
of WZ35 in the medium may contribute to its better
anti-proliferative effects than curcumin at the same
concentration (Figure 2). It was then observed that WZ35
significantly induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in
all the three gastric cancer cell lines, accompanied with the
corresponding changes in the levels of proteins involved
in cell cycle- and apoptosis-related cascades (Figure 2). As
expected, curcumin at the concentration of 20 μM showed
only a slight effect on both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
These data suggests that the chemical modification on the
natural curcumin is favorable to enhance both stability and
pharmacological activity. In the cellular level, our data
showed that gastric cancer cells are sensitive to treatment
with WZ35 at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 20 μM,
while curcumin did not exhibit good activity at the same
concentrations. Importantly, we observed no cytotoxic
effects of WZ35 treatment in normal human liver cells,
indicating that WZ35, like the leading curcumin, may be
safe for use. Besides the cellular effects, we have shown
that WZ35 is highly effective at inhibiting tumor growth
in a tumor model using nude mice (Figure 8). Also, WZ35
exhibited a high level of safety in mice (Figure 8D).
We then tried to probe the anti-cancer mechanisms
of WZ35. After finding the fact that either JNKmitochondrial or ER stress apoptotic pathway was
activated by WZ35 independently and only partly mediated

WZ35 inhibits SGC-7901 xenograft tumor growth
in vivo
The in vivo anti-tumor effect of WZ35 was
evaluated using SGC-7901 tumor xenograft models. The
nude mice with SGC-7901 xenografts were treated via oral
administration of WZ35 or curcumin once the tumor had
grown to a volume of 100-200mm3. As shown in Figure
8A-8C, treatment with WZ35 at 15, 30, or 50 mg/kg for
10 days dose-dependently resulted in significant reduction
in both tumor volume and weight. Similar results were
observed with curcumin at a dosage of 50 mg/kg.
Moreover, at the dose of 50 mg/kg, WZ35 displayed better

the anti-cancer action of WZ35, we paid attention on the
upstream ROS production, which has been reported as a
signaling target of curcumin at a high concentration[22].
Under physiological conditions, the maintenance of an
appropriate level of intracellular ROS is important in
keeping redox balance and cell proliferation[27]. Even
a modest increase in ROS levels can stimulate cell
growth and proliferation[28]. However, excessive ROS
production surmounts cellular antioxidant defenses and
triggers apoptosis[29]. Because the increase of ROS in
cancer cells may play an important part in the initiation
and progression of cancer, such intrinsic oxidative stress
is often viewed as an adverse event[30, 31]. Interestingly,
cancer cells are more sensitive to rapid increases in ROS
levels than normal cells[32]. Cancer cells with increased
oxidative stress are likely to be more vulnerable to damage
by further ROS insults induced by exogenous agents[33].
Therefore, manipulating ROS levels by redox modulation
is a way to selectively kill cancer cells without causing
significant toxicity to normal cells[34].
Indeed, redox dysregulation in cancer cells
represents a chemical vulnerability that can be targeted
by pro-oxidant redox intervention[35]. Overproduced
ROS and free radicals lead to serious damage to lipids,
proteins, and DNA, and regulate the process involved
in the initiation of apoptotic signaling[29, 36]. ROS
overproduction could induce the depolarization of the
mitochondrial membrane, which eventually results in an
increase in the level of other pro-apoptotic molecules in
the cytosol[37]. In addition, the role of ER stress in ROSinduced apoptosis has been demonstrated in a variety
of cell types[21, 38]. Recently, it has been reported that
curcumin-induced apoptosis is due to the production of

reactive oxygen species (ROS)[22, 23]. At apoptosisinducing concentrations, WZ35 induces ROS formation
within 30 min of treatment (Figure 7A and 7B). More
importantly, blockage of ROS by NAC totally abolished
the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by WZ35 in SGC7901 cells. These data validate that WZ35 induces cancer
cell death through activating ROS production.
Most of the pharmacological properties of plant
polyphenols are considered to reflect their ability to
scavenge endogenously generated oxygen radicals or
those free radicals formed by xenobiotics, radiations, etc.
However, some data in literature suggest that antioxidant
properties of the polyphenolic compounds may not
fully account for their chemopreventive effects[39].
Husain Yar Khan and his co-workers showed that plant
polyphenol induced cell death in human cancer cells
involves mobilization of intracellular copper ions and
reactive oxygen species generation[40]. Besides, a
number of natural and synthetic compounds containing
electrophilic Michael acceptor pharmacophores may
display promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic
anti-cancer activity [41]. Prototype Michael acceptors of
the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde-class including acrolein,
crotonaldehyde, and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal display
very high electrophilicity and chemical reactivity that
are associated with the interactions with a series of aldoketo reductase or oxidoreductase with sulfhydryl groups
to disrupt the redox balance[42]. Thus, we guess that, the
compound WZ35, structurally containing two Michael
acceptors (α, β-unsaturated ketone groups), may interact
some redox-related enzymes, which contributes to its prooxidant and consequent anti-cancer effects. Further studies
are necessary to use different ROS inhibitors to comfirm
the ROS-mediating mechanism and to definitively identify
the direct molecular target of WZ35.
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are
serine-threonine protein kinases that play the major role
in signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus.
Studies have demonstrated that ROS are also involved in
the regulation of different signal transduction pathways
including MAP kinases and transcription factors[43]. In
SGC-7901 cells, treatment with WZ35 for 1-3 h increased
the levels of all three pathways in MAPKs. Surprisingly,
only JNK activation is involved in the events of WZ35mediated cell death, which was confirmed by the use
of JNK inhibitor SP600125. Considerable evidences
suggested that JNK is primarily activated by various
environmental stresses including oxidative stress[44].
Figure 7G indicated that ROS blockage completely
inhibited WZ35-induced JNK phosphorylation. From these
data, we concluded that WZ35-induced apoptosis through
ROS-dependent JNK apoptotic pathway. It has been well
demonstrated that activation of JNK pathway induces
mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis via activating
mitochondrial Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase-3[16].
We found that WZ35 stimulation significantly increased

mechanism of WZ35’s anti-cancer activity.

the level of pro-apoptotic Bax and decreased the level of
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in SGC-7901 cells, while pretreatment
with SP600125 could reverse these changes (Figure 5).
Besides, we also found that WZ35-induced activation of
Bcl2/Bax pathway was almost completely blocked by
NAC (Figure 7G), indicating that ROS acts as a upstream
signaling molecules involved in WZ35-induced activation
of mitochondrial pathway.
In addition, in response to oxidative stress mediated
by ROS, accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins
triggers a cellular adaptive procedure known as ER
stress[45]. Cells initially adapt to the accumulation of
unfolded proteins by inducing the expression of ERresident molecular chaperones as well as by inhibiting new
protein synthesis[46]. However, if this adaptation does
not prove sufficient, the apoptotic response is initiated via
induction of ER-associated apoptotic molecules. Among
the ER-stress related proteins, ATF4, ATF6 and XBP-1
are typical ER stress-regulated proteins involved in ER
stress-induced apoptosis[45, 47]. Quite a few studies
indicated the regulation of ROS on ER stress activation
in a variety of cancer cell lines[21, 48]. Our findings
showed ATF4, ATF6 and XBP-1 are induced in a dosedependent manner after WZ35 stimulation, suggesting
that ER stress is activated 3-6 h after WZ35 treatment.
These initiations of ER stress apoptotic pathway have been
reported to increase CHOP gene expression, triggering
ER stress-specific cascade for implementation of
apoptosis[49]. Consequently, the up-regulation of CHOP
protein expression was observed in SGC-7901 cells after
WZ35 treatment for 6-12 h. Then, the question is whether
WZ35-induced cell apoptosis is ER stress-dependent or
not. CHOP induction is probably most sensitive to ER
stress response, and CHOP is considered as a marker
of commitment of ER stress-induced apoptosis[19].
Knockdown of CHOP by specific siRNAs also attenuated
the desipramine-induced and gamma-tocotrienol-induced
ER stress-mediated apoptotic cascade[50, 51]. The data
in Figure 6F using CHOP siRNA transfection solidly
supports the conclusion that WZ35-induced apoptosis
is, at least partially, ER stress-dependent. We found
that WZ35-induced activation of ER stress was almost
completely blocked by NAC (Figure 7H), indicating that
ROS production is also the upstream regulator of WZ35induced ER stress in gastric cancer cells. Interestingly,
we also found that JNK inhibition do not affect WZ35induced ATF4 expression (Figure 6D), indicating that
these two pro-apoptotic pathways do not crosslink and are
independently regulated by ROS (Figure 9).
In conclusion, we here investigated the antiproliferative effects and mechanisms of WZ35, a
chemically stable mono-carbonyl analog of curcumin,
in gastric cancer cell lines. In this study, we found that
WZ35 acts directly as a ROS activator in human gastric
cancer cells to induce cytotoxicity in a manner that
arrests cell cycle and causes apoptosis. Investigating the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanism in gastric cancer cells, we found that WZ35
treatment resulted in severe ROS accumulation. Excessive
ROS caused the activation of JNK-mitochondrial and ER
stress apoptotic pathways. The suppression of apoptosis
by NAC validates the critical role of ROS in WZ35induced cell death. Figure 9 showed a proposed signaling
model leading to development of ROS-induced cell death
induced by WZ35. These results indicate that the novel
curcumin analogue WZ35 possesses great potential as a
promising candidate for the treatment of gastric cancer.
In addition, we also demonstrated that ROS production
could be an important target for the development of new
anti-cancer drugs.

((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)benzaldehyde. Aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution (20% w/v, 5 ml) was added to a
solution of 3-methoxy-4-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)
benzaldehyde in acetone (20 ml). The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 5-6 h, then diluted
with brine and extracted with ethyl acetate. Finally, (E)4-(3-methoxy-4-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)phenyl)
but-3-en-2-one (1.81 mmol) and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde
(1.99 mmol) are dissolved in mixed suspension (10 ml)
which consist of sodium hydroxide powder and dioxane.
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for
6 h, then purified by the chromatography on silica gel to
afford (1E,4E)-1-(3-methoxy-4-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran2-yl)oxy)phenyl)-5-(2-nitrophenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one.
Then 5% HCl (1ml) was added dropwise with stirring, and
the end product was filtered and washed with water and
dried in vacuum. Before use in biological experiments,
compound WZ35 was recrystallized from CH2Cl2/
CH3CH2OH, and HPLC was used to determine the purity
of the compound (98.89%).

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
8 × 103 per well and allowed to grow overnight in RPMI
1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. WZ35 was
dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 1640 medium to final
concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20μM. The tumor
cells were incubated with WZ35 for 24 h before the MTT
assay. Curcumin was applied as positive control.

Dynamic monitoring of SGC-7901
proliferation using the RT-CES system

The real-time cell electronic sensing assay is based
on electrical impedance readings in cell monolayers plated
in wells containing built-in gold electrodes. ACEA RTCES analyzer, 8-well e-plates, and the integrated software
which we have used were from Acea Biosciences Inc (San
Diego, CA). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/
well in 250 μL of medium. The analyzer and the installed
plates were placed in a standard cell culture incubator, at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were
allowed to adhere to plates overnight. After cells seeded,
the analyzer was programmed to take readings during
0-96 h, and WZ35 at 0.4, 2.0 or 10 μM was added to the
medium at 28 h after incubation. Data were recorded and
analyzed using the integrated software. The cell index is a
quantitative measure of the spreading and/or proliferative
status of the cells in an electrode-containing well.

Stability evaluation of WZ35 and curcumin in
phosphate buffer
We tested the chemical stability of WZ35 and
curcumin in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) using absorption
spectrum assay. Briefly, absorbance readings were taken
from 250 to 600 nm using a spectra Max M5 (Molecular
Devices, USA). A stock solution of 1 mM curcumin or
WZ35 was prepared and diluted with phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 20 μM, the absorption
spectra were collected for over 25 min at 5 min intervals.
The UV-visible absorbance spectrum was measured at
25°C in a 1 cm path-length quartz cuvette.

Hoechst 33258 staining
At 24 h after WZ35 (2.5 or 10 μM) or curcumin
(20 μM) treatment, cells were fixed, washed twice with
PBS and stained with Hoechst 33258 staining solution
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Hoechst
Staining Kit, Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Apoptotic
features of cell death were determined by the staining of
cell nuclei with the DNA-binding fluorochrome H33258
assessing chromatin condensation by using inverted
fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan) with 20X
amplification. In each group, five microscopic fields were
selected randomly.

Stability of WZ35 and curcumin in cell cultural
medium
The SGC-7901 cells in 6-well plate were treated
with 10 μM WZ35 and curcumin in medium. After
specific intervals of time, the cultural medium was
collected, WZ35 and curcumin were extracted by the
addition of ethyl acetate, and their concentrations were
determined by HPLC method. An Agilent LC (1,200
series) was used for the HPLC analysis. The mobile phase
consisted of acetonitrile and water (50/50 to 60/40 v/v
in 20 min). Chromatographic separation was obtained
using a Beckman C18 reverse-phase column (5 μm, 4.6
mm × 25cm) at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min. WZ35 and curcumin elution was monitored at a
wavelength of 310 nm.

Negative Universal Control (Invitrogen) was used as
the control. SGC-7901 cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded
into 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h, and then were
transfected with siRNA duplexes against human CHOP
(100 nM) or control siRNA by lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells were further incubated for 48 h before harvest for
detection of CHOP expression by Western blot.

Determination of cellular reactive oxygen species
Cellular ROS contents were measured by flow
cytometry. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated on 60-mm
dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to
different concentrations of WZ35 for 30 min. Cells were
stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA or 5 μM DAF-FM-DA
(Beyotime Biotech, Nantong, China) at 37°C for 30 min.
Cells were collected and the fluorescence was analyzed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
CA). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 5
mM NAC for 2 h prior to WZ35 exposure and analysis of
ROS generation.

Western blot analysis

SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MGC-803 cells were
plated on 60-mm plates for 12 h, and then treated with
WZ35 (2.5 or 10 μM) and curcumin (20 μM) for 24 h.
Cells were then harvested, washed twice with ice-cold
PBS, and evaluated for apoptosis by double staining with
FITC conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI)
in binding buffer for 30 min using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA)

Cells or tumor tissues were homogenized in
protein lysate buffer, and debris was removed by
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The
protein concentrations in all samples were determined by
using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). After addition of sample loading buffer, protein
samples were electrophoresed and then transferred to
poly-vinylidene difluoride transfer membranes. The blots
were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with fresh 5%
nonfat milk in TBST and then incubated with specific
primary antibody in TBST overnight at 4°C. Following
three washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 h, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized
by using ECL kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The density
of the immunoreactive bands was analyzed using Image
J computer software (National Institute of Health, MD).

Cell Cycle Analysis

In vivo antitumor study

SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MGC-803 cells were
placed on 60-mm plates for 12 h, and then treated with
WZ35 (2.5, 5 or 10 μM) and curcumin (20 μM) for 24 h.
Cells were then collected into flow cytometry tubes and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain cell pellets.
The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS and then re-centrifuged. The cells were
resuspended in 100 μL PBS, 3 mL of -20°C ice-cold 75%
ethanol was added, and the cells were then incubated for
1 h at -20°C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and
10 mg/mL RNase A was added. Propidium iodide was
added to the tubes at a final concentration of 0.05 mg/mL
and incubated at 4°C for 20 min in the dark. Cell cycle
analysis was performed with FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, CA).

All animal experiments were complied with the
Wenzhou Medical University’s Policy on the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocols for animal studies
were approved by the Wenzhou Medical College Animal
Policy and Welfare Committee (Approved documents:
2012/APWC/0216). Five-week-old athymic BALB/
cA nu/nu female mice (18-22 g) purchased from Vital
River Laboratories (Beijing, China) were used for in vivo
experiments. Animals were housed at a constant room
temperature with a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle and fed a
standard rodent diet and water. SGC-7901 cells were
harvested and injected subcutaneously into the right flank
(1 ×107 cells in 150 μL of PBS). When tumors reach a
volume of 100-200 mm3, mice were administered once
daily with WZ35 (orally, 15, 30 or 50 mg/kg) or curcumin
(orally, 50 mg/kg). The tumor volumes were determined
by measuring length (l) and width (w) and calculating
volume (V = 0.5 × l × w2) at the indicated time points. At
the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the
tumors were removed and weighed for use in histology
and proteins expression studies.
