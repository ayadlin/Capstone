ABSTRACT
Cetuximab is a standard of care for treating EGFR-expressing metastatic
colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) exclusive of those with KRAS mutations at codons 12/13.
However, retrospective analysis has recently suggested that KRAS-G13D patients can
still benefit, while only a fraction of KRAS wild-type patients can benefit, from the
treatment. We set out to test this contradicting issue experimentally in an independent
cohort of patient derived xenograft (PDX) diseases. We conducted a mouse clinical
trial (MCT) enrolling a random cohort of 27 transcriptome sequenced CRC-PDXs to
evaluate cetuximab activity. The treatment responses were analyzed against the
KRAS 12/13 mutation alleles, as well as several other well-known oncogenic alleles.
If the response is defined by >80% tumor growth inhibition, 8/27 PDXs (~30%) are
responders versus 19/27 non-/partial responders (~70%). We found that indeed
there are no significantly fewer KRAS-12/13-allele responders (4/8 or 50%) than
non-/partial responders (7/19, or 37%). In particular, there are actually no fewer
G13D responders (4/8, or 50%) than in non-/partial responders (2/19 or 10.5%)
statistically. Furthermore, majority of the non-/partial responders tend to have certain
activating oncogenic alleles (one or more of the following common ones: K/N-RASG12V/D, -A146T, -Q61H/R, BRAF-V600E, AKT1-L52R and PIK3CA-E545G/K). Our data
on an independent cohort support the recent clinical observation, but against the
current practiced patient stratification in the cetuximab CRC treatment. Meanwhile,
our data seem to suggest that a set of the six-oncogenic alleles may be of better
predictive value than the current practiced stratification, justifying a new prospective
clinical investigation on an independent cohort for confirmation.

[1, 2] and panitumumab (Vectibix®). The latter two are
monoclonal antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which offer further clinical benefit for a
subset of mCRC [3, 4]. Cetuximab was first approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating
EGFR-expressing mCRC, either as a single agent (for
irinotecan-/OX-refractory patients) or in combination
with irinotecan (for irinotecan-refractory patients) [1],
excluding those with KRAS mutations at codons 12/13 [5].
However, only ~10% of mCRC patients would respond
to cetuximab monotheray as the second line therapy
[6]. Reports have suggested that gene amplification

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
common and deadliest malignancies, with high frequency
of metastasis (mCRC) (~50%). The common treatment
options include combination of different chemotherapy
agents (e.g. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV)(IV),
fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine, uracil/ftorafur) (UFT,
oral), 5-FU/oxaliplatin (OX)/Leucovorin (FOLFOX),
capecitabine/OX (CAPOX), capecitabine/irinotecan
(CAPIRI) and FOLFIRI, (5FU/irinotecan)) and targeted
Agents (e.g. bevacizumab (Avastin®), cetuximab (Erbitux®)

and over-expression of EGFR or its ligands, epiregulin
(EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG), could potentially
serve as the positive predictors of the response [5, 7],
while other genetic alterations could serve as negative
predictors [5], including the activating mutations [2] of
EGFR and BRAF (e.g. V600E), and the activation of
ERBB2 signaling [8], in addition to the KRAS mutations
[2, 9–12]. Nevertheless, with conflicting and inconclusive
observations so far, it remains a challenge to predict the
responders; and KRAS mutation still is the only biomarker
used in patient stratification in the clinic.
Importantly, two pieces of evidences indicate
that the current cetuximab label regarding KRAS
mutation may be incorrect, at least inaccurate. First, a
recent retrospective analysis of multiple phase-III trials
unexpectedly concluded that patients with KRAS codon
13 mutation (G13D) seem to benefit from the treatment
[13, 14]. Second, only 35~50% wild-type KRAS CRC
patients responded to cetuximab [2, 10], or nearly 50%
false positive rate. Therefore, there is apparent medical
importance and urgency to include previously excluded
“responders” so they can benefit from the treatment and
also to exclude the previously included “non-responders”
to avoid their unnecessary cost and suffers.
Patient derived xenograft (PDX) mirrors patient
tumors’ histopathology and molecular pathology (“patient
avatar”) [15–20], particularly those of metastatic tumors
[15], and recently also in CRC [21]. Large panel of PDXs
can reflect patient diversity and be used to evaluate therapy
by modeling clinical trial format — “mouse clinical trial”
or MCT [22]. This report described the establishment and
molecular characterization of a large panel of CRC-PDXs.
We conducted a MCT that was designed to experimentally
test the roles of KRAS mutations, particularly G13D,
along with other activating oncogene alleles in responses
to cetuximab, in which a random cohort of 27 EGFRexpressing subjects were enrolled. Our data confirmed that
KRAS wild type at positions 12/13 indeed is not predictive
of response to cetuximab and that G13D not predictive
of non-response. Rather, a small number of well-known
oncogenic mutation alleles seem to have better predictive
power than KRAS mutation at positions 12/13.

transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) of these models and
identified the oncogenic mutation alleles frequently found
in CRC as listed in Table 1, including KRAS, NRAS,
AKT1, BRAF, PIK3CA, and majority of the mutations
were also confirmed by hot-spot mutation analyses. All
the 27 PDXs express EGFR at mRNA levels, as shown
in Supplementary Table 1. 15 PDXs contain KRAS
mutations (56%), slightly higher than the reported
32–40% in patients. However, the deviation could result
from higher take-rate of tumors with KRAS mutations,
or simply small sample size. Among the 15 KRAS
mutants, 5/15 are at codon-12 (G12C/D/V) (~3%), 6/15
at codon-13 (G13D) (40%), 2/15 at Q61H (33%), and
2/15 at A146T (~13%). In total, there are 73% mutations
at codon 12/13, which is slightly lower than the clinically
reported 85–90%. Mutations at codon 61 and 146 are
more frequent than reported in the clinic (vs. 5% and 5%).
Again, the engraftment may not necessarily favor theses
non-codon-12/13 mutations because of small sample size.
One out of the 27 PDXs harbors NRAS Q61R mutation
(CR1574) (3.7%). Two out of the 27 models harbor
BRAF V600E mutations (7.4%, CR0004 and CR0029),
lower than the reported 15% in patients [23]. The BRAF
mutations are mutually exclusive to KRAS mutations in
these models as reported in CRC patients [2]. 5/27 with
PIK3CA E545G/K mutations (4 E545K, 1 E545G), and
1/27 with AKT1 mutation (CR1744:L52R) (Table 1). In
addition, several matched patient samples have also been
analyzed for oncogene mutations, confirming the same
genetic profiles (e.g. CR0455, Table 1) as seen by others
[15]. We also confirmed that all the tested CRC-PDXs
express EGFR at protein levels using IHC (examples
shown in Supplementary Figure 1, and all summarized
in Supplementary Table 1), as one of the current criteria
for cetuximab treatment in the clinic, although there is
no correlation found between response and EGFR levels.
In addition, the corresponding patient information and
histopathology are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

KRAS 12/13 mutations not predictive of poor
response to cetuximab
Recent retrospective analysis of clinical data
suggested that KRAS mutant at codon 13 can still
benefit from the cetuximab treatment, contrasting to
FDA guidance [2]. In order to investigate this further, we
conducted a prospective mouse clinical trial by randomly
enrolling a cohort of 27 experimental surrogate test
subjects as listed in Table 1, CRC-PDXs, which have been
transcriptome sequenced and confirmed to express EGFR.
We subjected this cohort to cetuximab treatment, and the
response to the treatment is analyzed using 20% ∆T/∆C
value as the threshold where lower value considered
as  responders and higher value considered non-/partial
responders. The results demonstrated that 8/27 are
responders (~30%) and 20/27 are non-/partial responders

RESULTS
Genomic profiling of CRC-PDXs
We set out to establish CRC-PDXs and
evaluate their response to cetuximab, and investigate
biomarkers predictive of the response. CRC are among
the cancer types that are most readily engrafted into
immunocompromised mice with high take-rate [21] and
we have successfully established a large collection of
CRC-PDXs by subcutaneously transplanting unsupervised
tumor tissues that were surgically removed from
treatment-naïve Asian CRC patients. We next performed

Certain oncogenic alleles better predictive of
cetuximab response in CRC

(70%) (Table 1). The representative tumor growth
inhibition of both responders and non-responders is shown
in Supplementary Figure 1. Interestingly, G12C/D/V and
G13D mutations are similarly found in both responders
and non-responders (Table 1 and Figure 1A, Fisher’s exact
test P = 0.67 if only considering codon-12/13; P = 1.0 if
considering all KRAS mutations), suggesting lesser roles
of KRAS mutation in determining response than originally
believed. In particular, there are 4/6 G13D falling
into responders, while none for the non-G13D KRAS
mutations (0/9), suggesting that indeed G13D patients can
benefit from the treatment, while other KRAS mutation
patients do not. This observation is consistent to the recent
analysis of clinical observation [13, 14]. Considering that
our data is completely independent of previous analysis
(unrelated subjects and test methods), the observation
is more likely to be true. It has been known that not all
KRAS mutations are equal with regard to their activity
and oncogenicity [14], which is strongly supported by
our data.

The 5/5 G12C/D/V are all non-responders, 2/2
A146T (CR0010 and CR0245) and 2/2 Q61H (CR1515
and CR1530) are all non-responders. 1/1 NRAS Q61R is
a non-responder (CR1574), mutually exclusive to KRAS
mutation and BRAF mutation. Both BRAF-V600E
containing models, CR0004 and CR0029, are nonresponders (2/2) (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2),
consistent to the observation that BRAF-V600E causes
resistance to cetuximab [24] and is mutually exclusive to
KRAS mutation. CR1744 with AKT1-L52R mutation is a
non-responder (1/1), mutually exclusive to KRAS, NRAS,
and BRAF mutation. 5/5 PIK3CA-E545K/Q546L mutants
(exon 9) are all non-/partial responders, not mutually
exclusive to other oncogene alleles, suggesting a possibly
role of PIK3KCA mutations in cetuximab resistance [25],
although not statistically significant (P = 0.28, Fisher’s
exact test).

In summary, 16/19 non-/partial responders have at
least one of the activating alleles of KRAS-G12G12C/D/V
(5/19), -Q61X (2/19), -A146T (2/19), NRAS-Q61X (1/19),
AKT1-L52R (1/19), PIK3CA-E545K/-Q546L (5/19) and
BRAF-V600E (2/19) (Table 1). This is in contrast to that
0/8 tested responders are wild-type for all these alleles
(Fisher’s exact test P = 7.43 × 10−5). Apparently, there are
5 models (5/19), CR-0560, −0205, −1795, −0012, −2226,
where cetuximab resistant alleles are still yet to be identified
[26]. This suggests that the composite oncogenic alleles
profile could be more predictive. We should point out that
the validity of this set of oncogenic alleles for predicting
cetuximab resistance need to be further validated by testing
in an independent cohort using a prospective design.

economic harm to patients, and enable them to explore
other treatment options.
PDX is an experimental model, although closely
mimicking patient tumors. The observation derived
from it still has to be proven in the clinics before clinical
application. However, as an experimental model, it has
certain advantages in scrutinizing the exact molecular
mechanisms over the patients as testing subjects, including
flexible design, precise enrollment (e.g. tumor size,
enrolling time, etc.), subjects naïve to prior treatments,
and precise dosing/pharmacokinetics, etc. Therefore, we
advocate performing co-clinical trial of mouse and human
for better understanding mechanism of drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DISCUSSION

Engraftment and tumor inhibition assays

Although KRAS-G13D has been suggested not used
as predictor for poor response to cetuximab per  recent
retrospective review of past clinical data [13], it is still
insufficient to change cetuximab label to recommend
these patients for cetuximab treatment. Usually, only a
confirmation in a prospective study using independent cohort
of similar disease can potentially be used to change the label.
Such a study is still to be conducted. PDXs have very similar
histopathology and molecular pathology as patient tumors,
and are thus considered closest surrogate experimental
models for human tumors [15–19]. A cohort of diverse
CRC-PDXs can be particularly useful to add a confirmation
in a similar clinical trial as in human. Our prospective mouse
clinical trial (MCT), using an independent cohort of test
subjects, confirmed that G13D indeed cannot predict the
poor response to cetuximab, in agreement with results from
retrospective analysis of human data. This result further
supports the notion that a human prospective trial should be
conducted to confirm this and to change the label thus many
G13D patients can also benefit from the treatment.
Our trial, using a random enrolled subjects, seems
to discover a new set of oncogenic alleles, with only
one of them being positive, to be better predictive of
poor cetuximab response (no false positive, 38.5% false
negative) than the current KRAS mutation at positions
12/13 (36.4% false positive, 75% false negative), or than
all KRAS mutations (26.7% false positive, 66.7% false
negative). On the other hand, the wild-type alleles/KRASG13D seem to be better predictive of response (38%
false positive, 0% false negative) than the current wild
type KRAS-12/13 rule (75% false positive, and 36.4%
false negative). However, this proposed new biomarker
signature derived from the current analysis needs further
prospective clinical study, mouse and/or human, using
independent cohorts, for confirmation. If confirmed, the
label can be changed so that the patients with wild type
KRAS mutation at position 12/13, but still with oncogenic
alleles described in this report, should be excluded from
the treatment so to avoid both unnecessary physical and

The methods and the parameters regarding
xenograftment of patient tissues and tumor inhibition
assays using PDXs have been described previously
[22, 23, 27]. Twenty-seven of these PDXs were randomly
enrolled in in vivo tumor inhibition trial using cetuximab
also as described [22, 23] (Crown Bioscience SPF
facility). EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses
of model tumors was performed as previously described
[22, 23].

Genomic analysis of PDXs
For transcriptome sequence of PDX tumor tissues,
per method described previously [22, 23], snap frozen
samples were used to extract RNAs. The purity and
integrity of the RNA samples were ensured by Agilent
Bioanalyzer prior to RNA sequencing. Only RNA samples
with RIN >7 and 28S/18S >1 were proceeded for library
construction and RNA sequencing. RNA samples (mouse
component <50%) were used for transcriptome sequencing
by certified Illumina HiSeq platform service providers
(BGI, Wuhan, China). The transcriptome sequencing
was generally performed at 6GB, PE125 on Illumina
HiSeq2500 platform or equivalent. For bioinformatics
analysis of transcriptome sequencing data, RNAseq raw
data was first cleaned up by removing contamination
reads that preferentially mapped to mouse genome (UCSC
MM9). Transcript expression was estimated by MMSEQ
software, and the SNP/INDELs on the expressed genes
were detected by BWA mapping software and GATK
variant discovery toolkit, and the gene fusion was searched
by SOAPfuse and Defuse. The confirmation of the hotspot
mutation was conducted for some mutation alleles as
previously described [23].

Statistical analysis
We used Welch’s t-test for two-sample comparisons,
and one-way ANOVA for multiple-sample comparisons,

and one-way ANOVA test for multiple comparisons as
previously described [22, 23]. Fisher’s exact test was used
to assess the response difference between responders and
non-responders.
