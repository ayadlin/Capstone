ABSTRACT
Small molecular inhibitors or drugs targeting specific molecular alterations are
widely used in clinic cancer therapy. Despite the success of targeted therapy, the
development of drug resistance remains a challenging problem. Identifying drug
resistance mechanisms for targeted therapy is an area of intense investigation,
and recent evidence indicates that cellular polyploidy may be involved. Here, we
demonstrate that the cell cycle kinase inhibitor, Oxindole-1 (Ox-1), induces mitotic
slippage, causing resistant polyploidy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Indeed,
Ox-1 decreases the kinase activity of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1, leading to inhibition
of Bcl-xL phosphorylation and subsequent resistance to apoptosis. Addition of ABT263, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, to Ox-1, or the other polyploidy-inducer, ZM447439
(ZM), produces a synergistic loss of cell viability with greater sustained tumor growth
inhibition in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Furthermore, genetic knockdown
of Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, exhibited synergistic inhibition of cell growth in combination
with Ox-1 or ZM. These data demonstrate that Bcl-xL is a key factor in polyploidization
resistance in AML, and that suppression of Bcl-xL by ABT-263, or siRNAs, may hold
therapeutic utility in drug-resistant polyploid AML cells.

INTRODUCTION

loss, resulting in aneuploidization and chromosomal
instability [2].
Polyploidy, a state in which cells possess more than
two complete sets of homologous chromosomes, usually
consists of an even number of sets with four (tetraploidy)
being the most common [3, 4]. Tetraploid cells are
generated through a variety of mechanisms, including
cytokinesis failure and viral-induced cell fusion [3]. Cells

Genomic instability, a hallmark of transformed
cells, is thought to drive tumorigenesis by favoring the
generation of aggressive tumor cells with a reduced
propensity for apoptosis [1]. One mechanism of genomic
instability involves a transient phase of polyploidization
followed by asymmetric cell divisions and/or chromosome

can also become tetraploidy after prolonged mitotic arrest
by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which functions
to arrest mitotic cells with defects that prevent normal
kinetochore–microtubule attachment [5]. If SAC is
not satisfied, cells exit mitosis and enter the next G1 as
tetraploid cells in a process known as mitotic “slippage”,
which requires the ubiquitylation and proteolysis of cyclin
B1 [3, 6], a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase
1 (CDK1, also known as CDC2). Mitotic slippage occurs
without karyokinesis and results in polyploidy cells with
a single large nucleus, unlike cytokinesis failure and
cell fusion, which give rise to binucleate cells [3]. Due
to a weakened SAC, cells may slip out of mitotic arrest
before they die; thus, mitotic slippage protects cells from
death and the resulting tetraploidy could pose a barrier to
chemotherapy against malignancy [7-9].
Indeed, recent studies support a link between
polyploidy and resistance to chemotherapy: polyploid
giant cancer cells were shown to be resistant to cisplatin
treatment [10], and cisplatin treatment led to the induction
of 4N tetraploidy in HCT116 cisplatin-resistant clones
[11]. Likewise, small molecular inhibitors generate
polyploid cancer cells [12-14], and induce apoptosis
secondary to polyploidization [13, 15]. However,
polyploidization is not an absolute commitment to
apoptosis because polyploid cells can spawn viable
progeny [16], possibly leading to drug resistance or more
aggressive secondary tumors. For example, preexisting
cellular polyploidy had intrinsic resistance to CDK2
inhibitors [17], while breast cancer cell polyploidy
secondary to small-molecule inhibitor BMS-777607
demonstrated increased resistance to chemotherapeutics
[18].
Previous studies suggest two mechanisms by which
polyploidy avoids apoptosis in chemotherapy. The first
one is by up-regulation of pro-survival members from
the Bcl-2 family proteins. For example, overexpression
of Bcl-xL protects against mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP) and subsequently leads to
polyploidy resistance promoted by Aurora B inhibitor [19]
; furthermore, elevated Mcl-1 expression increased mitotic
slippage and attenuated apoptosis in the polyploidy cells
caused by anti-tubulin chemotherapeutics [20]. The second
mechanism is by slippage-induced inhibition of CDK1
(CDC2)/cyclin B1 kinase activity. CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin
B1 phosphorylates and inactivates the anti-apoptotic
members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 [8, 20,
21]; consequently, slippage-induced inhibition of CDK1
(CDC2)/cyclin B1 kinase activity leads to reduction of
apoptosis [8, 9]. Better understanding of the mechanisms
by which polyploid cells evade apoptosis will improve
efficacy of small molecular inhibitors and minimize the
danger posed by post-treatment, genetically reshuffled
tumor cells.
Here, we identify that Bcl-xL dephosphorylation,
which is resulted from mitotic slippage and the resulting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1 kinase activity, is
responsible for the viability of resistant small molecular
inhibitor-induced polyploid cells. We show that inhibition
of Bcl-xL by small molecular inhibitor, ABT-263, or by
siRNAs, triggers the rapid demise of polyploid cells in
AML cell lines and primary bone marrow blasts, but not
in normal, non-transformed cells. Our data suggest that
combining polyploidy-inducing small molecular inhibitors
with agents targeting Bcl-xL could be a promising strategy
for AML therapy.

RESULTS
Ox-1 treatment produces resistant polyploidy cells
in AML cell line
Oxindole-1 (Ox-1) (Figure 1A), a potent and
selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase Flk-1, also inhibits
CDK4/cyclin D1 enzyme (Figure S1A) [22], which plays
a crucial role in regulating G1/S transition. Aberrant
activity of CDK4/cyclin D1 has been implicated in several
cancers, and blocking CDK4/cyclin D1 activity with Ox-1
was previously shown to be an effective anticancer therapy
for pRb+ solid tumors [22]. In the present study, we
noticed that Ox-1 minimally inhibits cell growth of NB4
and U937 AML cell lines (Figure 1B). Flow cytometry
analysis confirms that Ox-1 hardly induces apoptosis in
AML cell lines as manifested by the minimal Sub G1 peak
(Figure 1C-1F). Furthermore, we fail to detect any effects
of Ox-1 on G1/S transition, though Ox-1 treatment induces
appearance of polyploid cells in a dose- ((Figure 1C &
1D) and time-dependent manner (Figure 1E and 1F).
The minimal concentration of Ox-1 required to
induce polyploidy is 5 µM for both U937 and NB4 cells.
At this concentration, 30.1% (29% 4N; 1% 8N) of U937
and 30.6% (30.6% 4N; 0% 8N) of NB4 cells underwent
polyploidy. The percentages were significantly higher
when Ox-1 was used at 10 µM (49.8% 4N and 29.6%
8N in U937; 37% 4N and 52% 8N in NB4) to 20 µM
(45% 4N and 31% 8N in U937; 25.2% 4N and 66.8%
8N in NB4) (Figure 1D). Time-dependent polyploidy is
shown in Figure 1E & 1F. Polyploidy was seen as early
as 24h after 10 µM Ox-1 treatment. More than 80% of
cells underwent polyploidy in U937 (34.1% 4N; 53.3%
8N), and NB4 (25.1% 4N; 60.3% 8N) cells after 72h of
treatment.
Our results indicate a delayed progression of cellular
mitosis in the presence of Ox-1, which prompts us to
consider affected microtubule dynamics. We therefore
conducted immunofluorescent staining to evaluate
α-tubulin in spindle assembly. Compared with untreated
control cells, NB4 cells treated with Ox-1 show a single
large nucleus with severely disorganized mitoses marked

(MTI)-induced Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation and
inactivation of their anti-apoptotic effects, leading to
cell death [8]. In particular, phosphorylation of Bcl-xL
(Ser62) plays a crucial role in MTI-induced cell death
[8]. Due to the suppression of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1
activity upon the treatment with Ox-1 (Figure 1H), we
detected the expression of Bcl-xL and p-Bcl-xL (Ser62) by
treatment with Ox-1 in NB4 cells. Indeed, Ox-1 reduced
the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL and expression of p-Ser62
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2A).
To further demonstrate that, we treated NB4 cells with
increasing concentrations of vinblastine, which shows a
dose-dependent increase of Bcl-xL phosphorylation and
p-Bcl-xL (Ser62) expression, with a dose dependency of
cyclin B1 and cleavage PARP strikingly similar to the
level of Bcl-xL phosphorylation (Figure 2B).
We next tested whether Ox-1 could reverse
vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-xL. For
this purpose, we selected two validated CDK1 (CDC2)
inhibitors, Roscovitine (Ros) [25] and RO-3306 (RO)
[26], as positive controls. Cells were synchronized with
a double thymidine block and treated with vinblastine
1h after release from G1/S phase. The CDK1 (CDC2)
inhibitors, Ox-1, or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle,
were added for 2h at 10h or 12h following G1/S release
in the presence of vinblastine. This experimental strategy
is schematized in Figure S2A. Extracts were made and
subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-xL, p-Bcl-xL (Ser62),
and cyclin B1 (Figure 2B). Lane 1 shows the baseline, i.e.
blots of cell extracts at time of the second release (0h).
Evidenced by comparison of Lane 1 and Lane 2 in Figure
2C, vinblastine induces a marked increase in Bcl-xL
phosphorylation at 10h post-G1/S release as well as during
the interval from 10h to 12h post-G1/S release (Lane 1
and Lane 3), as expected. Ox-1 and the CDK1 (CDC2)
inhibitors all blocked this increase (Figure 2C; comparison
of Lane 3 with Lanes 4-6). Effects are similar at 12h to
14h post-G1/S release in the presence of vinblastine
(Figure 2C; Lanes 7-10). These data indicate that Ox-1,

Ox-1 treatment induces SAC inactivation and
leads to subsequent mitotic slippage
SAC normally functions to delay progression into
anaphase until all chromosomes attain bipolar attachment
to the mitotic spindle by inhibiting Cdc20, a co-factor
of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/
cyclosome (APC/C). An activated SAC binds to Cdc20
via its proteins, MAD2 and BubR1, to inhibit the ability
of Cdc20 to activate the APC/C-mediated proteolysis of
cyclin B1, whereas unsatisfied SAC fails to sequester
Cdc20 and ultimately activates APC/C, leading to the
degradation of cyclin B1 [23, 24].
Our present study supports that Ox-1 treatment
reduces the levels of SAC proteins, MAD2 and BubR1
(Figure 1H); IP pull-down assay further indicated
that MAD2 and BubR1 were decreased in Cdc20
immunoprecipitates when cells were treated with dosedependent Ox-1 (Figure S1B). These data indicate that
Ox-1 treatment promotes the inactivation of SAC and
leads to the decrease of Cdc20 inhibition. Consequently,
cyclin B1 was gradually degraded in a dose-dependent
way, followed by concurrently inhibition of CDK1
(CDC2) kinase activity as manifested by the increase
of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Tyr15, while proapoptotic protein cleavage PARP fails to rise (Figure 1H).
Therefore, it appears that Ox-1 treatment permits cell entry
into anaphase despite not satisfying SAC, contributing to
mitotic slippage and resistance to apoptosis.

via reducing the activity of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1,
inhibits vinblastine-induced Bcl-xL phosphorylation at
Ser62.

We next determine whether Ox-1 affects Bcl-xL
phosphorylation through mitotic slippage, which can lead
to the decrease of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1 activity, or
direct inhibition of CDK1 (CDC2) kinase. Cells were
synchronized with a double thymidine block and treated
with either a vehicle or vinblastine at 1h post-release;
MG132 (25 µM), which inhibits the mitotic slippage
by suppressing the degradation of cyclin B1, was then
added 20min prior to the addition of the vehicle, CDK1
(CDC2) inhibitors, or Ox-1, at 10h post-release, with cells
harvested at 12h and 14h post-release. This experimental
strategy is schematized in Figure S2B. As shown in Figure
2D, MG132 reverses Ox-1-induced-dephosphorylation of
Bcl-xL, and increases the expression of Ser62 and cyclin
B1 at 10-12h post-release (Figure 2D; comparison of Lane
5 with 6) and 12-14h post-release (Figure 2D; comparison
of Lane 13 with 14). MG132 fails to reverse similar
effects caused by CDK1 (CDC2) inhibitors (Figure 2D;
comparisons of Lane 7 with 8; Lane 9 with 10; Lane 15
with 16; Lane 17 with 18). Thus, we conclude that small
molecular inhibitor Ox-1 inhibits vinblastine-induced BclxL phosphorylation through mitotic slippage rather than
direct inhibition of CDK1 (CDC2) kinase.

μM ABT-263 (CI = 0.231; Q = 1.24) or 20 μM Ox-1 and
2 μM ABT-263 (CI = 0.260; Q = 1.25), show synergetic
effects in NB4 cells (Figure 3A).
Cell cycle distribution further shows that Ox-1
mono-therapy induces huge polyploid cells (35.1% 4N and
55.7% 8N) that are blocked significantly in combination
with ABT-263 (7.1% 4N and 25.3% 8N) (Figure 3B and
3C). ABT-263 meanwhile triggers rapid apoptosis in
polyploid cells as seen by an increase in Sub G1 from 3.9%
(Ox-1 alone) to 49.8% (combination of Ox-1 and ABT263) (Figure 3B and 3C). Furthermore, Ox-1 combined
with ABT-263 induces significant apoptotic cell death in
an Annexin V-FITC assay (Figure 3D and 3E) as well as
significant increase of the pro-apoptotic cleaved PAPR and
the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL (Ser62), with no effects on
the expression of MAD2 and BubR1 (Figure 3F).
ABT-263 simultaneously inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Bcl-w; two of which (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) are co-expressed
in many human cancer cells [30, 31]. Accordingly, we
applied siRNAs to determine which of the two ABT-263
targets, when inhibited, would phenocopy the synergistic
activity observed for ABT-263 in combination with Ox1. We designed two target-specific siRNAs for both Bcl2 (Figure 4A) and Bcl-xL (Figure 4B), with the second
siRNA for both of them showing the significant inhibition
and being used in the following experiments. Subsequent
results showed that Bcl-xL silencing alone exhibited
synergistic inhibition of cell growth in combination with
Ox-1 (Figure 4C), suggesting that ABT-263 inhibition of
Bcl-xL is responsible for the synergistic cytotoxicity with
Ox-1.

To identify agents that could be combined
therapeutically with Ox-1, we tested cell viability effects
of Ox-1 in combination with several established and
experimental cancer therapeutics often used in AML. We
did not find any synergistic cytotoxicity of Ox-1 with these
agents (data not shown). We postulated that Ox-1-induced
polyploid cells may account for the lack of synergy with
other cytotoxic chemotherapy agents [18], and so addition
of orally bioavailable ABT-263, a small-molecule BH3
mimetic that inhibits Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w [9, 21],
was tested to enhance the cytotoxic activity of Ox-1. NB4
cells were cultured with combinations of these two drugs
at different doses but in a constant ratio (Ox-1 to ABT263: 5 μM to 0.5 μM,10 μM to 1 μM, and 20 μM to 2 μM,
respectively) for 48h. Both CalcuSyn software [27, 28]
and Jin’s formula [29] were used to determine the synergy
of the two agents. The combination of 5 μM Ox-1 with 0.5
μM ABT-263 in NB4 cells inhibited growth by 35.39%,
compared with monotherapy of Ox-1(22.44%) or ABT263 (9.54%), indicating synergism (CI = 0.441; Q = 1.19).
Escalating doses, i.e. co-treatment with 10 μM Ox-1 and 1

We confirm the above findings with ZM447439
(ZM), an Aurora selective ATP-competitive inhibitor [32]
that induces polyploidy in a dose-dependent manner in
AML cell lines (Figure 5A). ZM treatment also results
in reduced levels of SAC proteins, MAD2 and BubR1,
as well as cyclin B1 protein, indicating the occurrence
of mitotic slippage (Figure 5B). Both CalcuSyn software
and Jin’s formula show that ZM, like Ox-1, has synergistic
effects with ABT-263 in AML cell lines (Figure 5C). In
addition, Bcl-xL silencing in combination with ZM
exhibits significantly more synergistic inhibition of
cell growth than the combination with Bcl-2 silencing
and control. Furthermore, we found that ABT-263 also
triggered robust apoptosis in polyploidy cells caused by
the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin [19] (Figure S3A &
S3B).
To further demonstrate that polyploid phenotype
renders cell survival dependent on the anti-apoptotic
activity of Bcl-xL, we detected the expression of BclxL in multiple AML cell lines. We found that Bcl-xL

lines, but much higher in Kasumi-1 and KG1a AML cell
lines (Figure S4A), which both show high expression of
CD34 surface antigen and are insensitive to Daunorubicin
(DNR) in our previous study [33]. Furthermore, the MTT
assay indicated that ABT-263 exhibited significantly
more synergistic inhibition of cell growth with Ox-1 in
Kasumi-1 and KG1a cell lines, compared with that in
U937 and NB4 cell lines (Figure S4B), indicating that
more malignant AML cell lines show higher sensitivity

ABT-263 serves as a promising strategy to overcome
polyploid resistance in AML.

After incubation of primary leukemia blasts with DMSO,
Ox-1, or ZM, and/or ABT-263 for 24h, Annexin V-FITC
staining shows that Ox-1 or ZM alone induces minimal
apoptosis, but in combination with ABT-263 significantly
enhances cell death via apoptosis in primary blasts. In
contrast, combining Ox-1 with ABT-263 does not produce
synergistic cytotoxicity in normal bone marrow cells
(Figure 6B). Detailed apoptosis analyses performed in
primary AML blasts and normal blasts are shown (Figure

ABT-263 enhances the efficacy of small molecular
inhibitors in primary AML blasts but not in

Small molecular inhibitors and drugs targeting
specific molecular alterations, alone or in combination
with standard chemotherapies, are widely used in clinic.
Despite the success of these new compounds, their main
limitation is the development of resistance. Alteration in
the activity and expression of proteins have already been
linked to the onset of resistance [34], but recent evidence
indicates that polyploidization plays a role as well [17,
18]. In this study, we find that VEGF receptor tyrosine
kinase Flk-1 and CDK4/cyclin D1 enzyme inhibitor,

DISCUSSION

Lastly, we asked whether Ox-1 and ZM could
induce resistant polyploidy in primary leukemia blasts,
and whether Bcl-2 family inhibitor ATB-263 could induce
apoptosis in those polyploid cells. Exposure of primary
leukemia blasts to Ox-1 and ZM for 48h produces marked

respectively) for 48h. The numbers of viable cells were measured by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Shown are mean ± SD, * P < 0.05;

Ox-1 (Figure 1A; Figure S1A), minimally inhibits cell
growth in AML cell lines (Figure 1B), and minimally
induces cell apoptosis by cell cycle distribution, and in
fact generates resistant polyploid cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 1C-1F). The mechanism
by which polypoloid cells remain viable is unclear and
merits further investigation.
Polyploidy, often tetraploidy, commonly originates
from cell fusion or cytokinesis [3] though also occurs
through mitotic slippage induced by SAC-dissatisfaction
[7, 35]. Cell fate after mitotic arrest depends on two
competing networks: cyclin B1 degradation and the
generation of death signals that activate caspases [7, 36].
Slippage occurs if cyclin B1 levels fall below the mitotic
exit threshold before the generation of sufficient death
signals, whereas cell death occurs if sufficient death signals
accumulate before cyclin B1 is adequately degraded.
Accordingly, slippage and apoptosis can be viewed as two
competing pathways. Here, we note that Ox-1 treatment
induces decreases in SAC proteins, MAD2 and BubR1
(Figure 1H), and their binding with Cdc20 (Figure S1B).
Furthermore, cyclin B1 was gradually degraded in a dosedependent way, followed by the concurrent decrease of
CDK1 (CDC2) activity, indicating the occurrence of
mitotic slippage. Mitotic slippage is further supported by
the failure of cleavage PARP levels to increase following
Ox-1 treatment (Figure 1H). At this time, it is not clear
how Ox-1-induced polyploid cells escape apoptosis and
would be worth studying in the future.
Recent studies reported that fates of mitotic
slippage-induced polyploid cells depend on the actions of
CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1 on proteins that directly regulate
apoptosis. CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1 phosphorylates and
inactivates anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein
family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) [5, 8, 20], which
are necessary for mitochondrial apoptosis and caspase
activation. Mitotic slippage can lead to the inhibition of
CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1 activity, ultimately resulting
in the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members
and subsequent reduction in apoptosis [9]. Here, we
demonstrated that Ox-1 suppressed the phosphorylation
of Bcl-xL and reduced the expression of p-Ser62 in a
dose- and time-dependent way (Figure 2A). Vinblastine
normally facilitates phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at Ser62,
resulting in disabled anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL
[8], which is supported by our findings (Figure 2B). In
addition, we show that Ox-1, like our two tested CDK1
(CDC2) inhibitors, inhibits vinblastine-induced BclxL phosphorylation and decreases the expression of
p-Ser62 (Figure 2C). We show that these Ox-1-induced
changes, unlike those produced by the two CDK1 (CDC2)
inhibitors, are rescued by MG132 (Figure 2D); thus, Ox-1
promotes the dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL via mitotic
slippage rather than direct inhibition of CDK1 kinase.
To rid AML cell lines of remaining resistant
polyploid cells induced by Ox-1, we tried combination
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy with ABT-263, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor. Both
CalcuSyn software and Jin’s formula show that ABT-263
has synergistic cytotoxicity with Ox-1 (Figure 3A). ABT263 reverses Ox-1-mediated polyploid cells and induces
rapid apoptotic cell death (Figure 3B-3F). However,
ABT-263 has two main targets and we show that Bcl-xL
silencing, not Bcl-2 silencing, is responsible for ABT263 synergy with Ox-1 (Figure 4C) and may eventually
play a crucial role in combating Ox-1-drug resistance.
We then asked ourselves whether ABT-263 or Bcl-xL
silencing could be effective against drug resistance seen
with other polyploidy-inducers such as ZM447439, an
Aurora selective ATP-competitive inhibitor [32] that
induces polyploidy through mitotic slippage in AML cell
lines (Figure 5A and 5B). We find that ABT-263, via BclxL inhibition, elicits synergistic effects when combined
with ZM (Figure 5C-5E). Notably, ABT-263 induced
robust apoptosis in polyploidy cells made by the myosin
II inhibitor blebbistatin [19] (Figure S3A & S3B). Our
following MTT assay further indicated that ABT-263
showed more synergistic inhibition of cell growth with
Ox-1 in Kasumi-1 and KG1a cell lines, which are both
characterized by high expression of CD34 surface antigen
[33] and Bcl-xL (Figure S4A & S4B). Hence, Bcl-xL
is a target for polyploidy resistance and the cells with
overexpression of Bcl-xL are more sensitive to Bcl-xL
inhibition, supporting that ABT-263 serves as a promising
method of reversing polyploidy drug resistance seen in
more malignant AML cells.
ABT-263 has already proven efficacious in solid
tumors in a Phase 1 clinical study [37], but it has not
yet been tested in hematologic malignancies. In primary
AML blasts, we find that Ox-1 and ZM produce significant
numbers of polyploid cells (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
administration of Ox-1 or ZM alone induces minimal
apoptosis in AML blasts, whereas combination regimens
of Ox-1 or ZM plus ABT-263 produce significant
apoptotic cell death (Figure 6B and 6C). It is worth noting
that Ox-1 treatment combined with ABT-263 does not
produce synergistic cytotoxicity in normal bone marrow
cells (Figure 6B and 6C). We believe that ABT-263 could
be a potential therapeutic to enhance the cytotoxicity of
polyploidy inducers in AML cells while sparing normal
bone marrow.
In summary, we demonstrate the pro-survival
function of Bcl-xL in cancer polyploid cells induced by
small molecular inhibitors. Furthermore, combination
of Bcl-xL inhibitor and polyploid inducers produces
synergistic anti-proliferative activity in vitro and enhanced
efficacy in vivo. Moreover, these data support a potential
therapeutic application of ABT-263 that specifically
exploits and targets polyploid phenotype in malignancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

concentrations of compounds for 48h. Single-cell
suspensions were collected and fixed in ice-cold 70%
ethanol overnight, labeled with 500 µL propidium iodide
(50 µL/ mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 15min in dark
at room temperature (RT), and analyzed directly on a
Beckon Dickinson FACScan (Oxford). The Sub G1 peak
was utilized as a measure of apoptosis.

Reagent and cell culture
Ox-1 (Santa Cruz), ZM (ACC), blebbistatin
(APEXBIO), ABT-263 (Selleckchem), Roscovitine (Santa
Cruz), RO-3306 (Santa Cruz), were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -20°C. Human NB4 and
U937 cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Control cultures received an equivalent amount of DMSO
only. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) or
mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were obtained from 10 newly diagnosed AML patients and
3 healthy donors. All donors provided written informed
consent, and the study had the approval of the Institute
Research Ethics Committee at Sun Yat-Sen University,
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient
characteristics are shown in Table 1. PBMCs and BMMCs
were enriched from the diagnostic bone marrow samples
of patients with de novo AML by Ficoll-Hypaque (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO) density gradient centrifugation.

Cell synchronization
Cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by
standard double thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) blocking
method. Briefly, cells were blocked for 16h with
thymidine, subsequently released in fresh media for 8h
and exposed to thymidine for an additional 16h, then
released again in fresh media. Cells were then incubated in
the presence of vinblastine at 1h and subsequently treated
by Ox-1, CDK inhibitors, or DMSO at 10h. Finally, cells
were collected at the indicated time points.

Western blot analysis
Total cellular proteins were isolated with lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.25% NP40; 2.5
mM sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA;
1 mM b-glycerophosphate; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1 mM PMSF;
1 μg/mL leupeptin). Equal amounts of cell extract were
subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel
and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad).
The membrane was blocked and then incubated with
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
Ambion), MAD2 (Abcam), cyclinB1, p-Bcl-xL (Ser62)
, Bcl-2 (all from Santa cruz, CA), CDC2, p-CDC2, BclxL, cleaved poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP), and
BubR1 antibodies (all from Cell Signaling) overnight at
4°C and incubated with a HRP conjugated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit secondary antibody at room temperature for
1h. The protein bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

MTT assay
Cell viability was assessed by standard MTT
assay (Sigma-Aldrich). The absorbance was determined
at a test wavelength of 490 nm on a multiwell plate
reader (Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Percent cell viability was calculated as cell viability of
the experimental cells divided by cell viability of the
control samples, times 100. At least three independent
experiments were performed.

Annexin V analysis
An Annexin V assay was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit, EMD Biosciences). Briefly, approximately
5×105/mL cells in 35 mm plates were treated with various
concentrations of the indicated compounds. The cells were
harvested and used for Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using FACS
flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest software (BD
Immunocytometry Systems).

Immunofluorescence staining
NB4 cells were incubated with Ox-1 at 10 µM for
48h. Cells were fixed in cold methanol for 20min at 4°C
and permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS at RT for
15min. Then cells were incubated with 1% BSA for 1h
at RT to block nonspecific binding before the primary
antibody reaction. Slides were incubated with the primary
antibody to a-tubulin at RT for 1h, followed by Alexa
Flour 680 or FITC 488 conjugated antibody. Nuclei were
stained with DAPI (1 µg/mL), and cells were visualized
using a microscope (1000x, Olympus).

Cell cycle analysis
For the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
by Ox-1, ZM, and/or APT-263, approximately 5x105/
mL cells in 6-well plates were treated with various
