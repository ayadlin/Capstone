Abstract
Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy develops in the majority of patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC). Platinum compounds form electrophilic intermediates that mediate DNA cross-linking and
induce double-strand DNA breaks. Because the cellular response to electrophilic xenobiotics is partly
mediated by Keap1–Nrf2 pathway, we evaluated the presence of Kelch-like ECH–associated protein 1
(Keap1) mutations and NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway activation in EOC and correlated these with
platinum resistance and clinical outcome. Nrf2 immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear localization (a
surrogate of pathway activation) in over half of EOC patient specimens examined, with more common
occurrence in the clear cell EOC subtype. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Nrf2 target genes were
upregulated in tumors with nuclear positivity for Nrf2. Microarray analysis also showed upregulation of
Nrf2 target genes in clear cell EOCs compared with other EOC subtypes. In addition, Keap1 sequence
analysis revealed genetic mutations in 29% of clear cell samples and 8% of nonclear cell tumors. RNAimediated knockdown of Keap1 was associated with Nrf2 pathway activation and resistance to carboplatin
in vitro. Importantly, patients with evidence of Nrf2 pathway activation had fewer complete clinical
responses to platinum-based therapy, were enriched for platinum resistance, and had shorter median
overall survival compared with those who did not show evidence of Nrf2 pathway activation. Our findings
identify Keap1 mutations in EOC and they suggest a previously unrecognized role for the Keap1–Nrf2
pathway in mediating chemotherapeutic responses in this disease. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5081–9. 2011

Introduction
Resistance to active drugs such as platinum compounds
commonly occurs during treatment of epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC; refs. 1, 2). These drugs form electrophilic intermediates that act via nucleophilic substitution reactions to
form inter- and intrastrand DNA crosslinks. The cellular
response to electrophilic xenobiotics is partly mediated by
the Keap1–Nrf2 signaling system (3). NF-E2–related factor 2
(Nrf2) is a leucine zipper transcription factor, which under
basal conditions is tethered to its cytoplasmic inhibitor Kelchlike ECH–associated protein 1 (Keap1). Upon binding to Nrf2,
Keap1 inhibits Nrf2 function by promoting degradation of

Nrf2 (4). Electrophilic xenobiotics trigger the disassociation of
Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing subsequent translocation of Nrf2
into the nucleus. Nrf2 subsequently activates transcription of a
variety of genes whose protein products protect against
oxidative stress, mediate detoxification of substances through
glutathione conjugation, and participate in ATP-dependent
drug efflux (5, 6).
The role that the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway plays in the development of drug resistance in EOC is poorly understood. In this
study, we assessed the prevalence of Keap1 mutations and
Nrf2 pathway activation in EOC, and the relationship between
Nrf2 pathway activation, platinum resistance, and clinical
outcome.

the results. Therefore, data are reported using only the genes
of the Biocarta Nrf2 pathway and NQO1.
Statistical analysis
The association between Nrf2 IHC results and various
clinicopathologic factors was assessed by Fisher's exact test.
Overall survival (OS) curves were generated by the Kaplan–
Meier method, and statistical significance was assessed by
using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was done by
using a Cox proportional hazards regression model that
included grade (1–2 vs. 3), age (<65 vs. 65 years), stage (2
vs. 3 or 4), histology (clear cell, papillary serous, endometrioid),
debulking status (optimal, less than or equal to 1 cm; or
suboptimal, greater than 1 cm residual disease), and Nrf2
pathway status (Nrf2 pathway up vs. Nrf2 pathway down). For
the purpose of this report, clinical complete remission (CCR)
is defined as resolution of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and normalization of the serum CA-125 level
after the completion of first-line chemotherapy, whereas
platinum resistance is defined as progressive disease on
platinum therapy, or less than a complete response to platinum therapy, or progression within 6 months of completing
platinum therapy.

"boost/nest" PCR strategy. Bidirectional DNA sequencing was
conducted, and the sequences of all the primers (boost and nest
primers) are provided in Supplementary Table S2 for both
Keap1 and Nrf2. All reported sequence alterations were confirmed by sequencing in both directions and the associated
base call accuracy was more than 99% in all cases.
Microarray datasets and analysis
Two publicly available microarray datasets were used in
this study and have been previously described by our group
and others (8, 9). Hierarchical clustering based on the expression of Nrf2 pathway genes (i.e., genes of the Biocarta Nrf2
pathway including the experimentally validated Nrf2 target
genes SOD2, GPX3, SLC3A1, GGT1, GSTM3, CRYZ, POR, and
NQO1) was conducted by using the average linkage method.
Pathway analysis was done by using the Efron–Tibshirani's
gene set analysis method (10). We also searched MsigDB
datasets and the KEGG pathway database and identified
one more signature (besides the Biocarta "NRF2 pathway")
that included NRF2 genes termed "SINGH-NFE2L2-TARGETS." Inclusion of the "SINGH-NFE2L2-TARGETS" genes
in pathway analyses and hierarchical clustering did not alter

Nrf2 pathway activation in EOC
We conducted IHC to assess the expression and localization
of Nrf2 protein in 30 EOC specimens obtained during primary
debulking surgery, with the results shown in Table 1. Nuclear
Nrf2 staining was detected in 17 (57%) of EOC specimens
overall and was more common in clear cell EOCs (11 of 14,
79%) compared with nonclear cell EOC (6 of 16, 38%, 2-sided
Fisher's exact P ¼ 0.033; Table 1, Fig. 1A–C). There were no
differences in age, grade, or debulking status between Nrf2
immunopositive and negative specimens (Table 1). Two normal mullerian epithelium specimens showed no evidence for
Nrf2 nuclear protein by IHC (Fig. 1B).
To evaluate whether presence of nuclear Nrf2 staining was
associated with Nrf2 transcriptional activity, we compared
the expression levels of 2 Nrf2 target genes (SOD2 and GPX3)
in Nrf2 immunopositive and immunonegative specimens
using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that both genes
were statistically significantly upregulated in Nrf2 immunopositive compared with immunonegative specimens (16.3and 13.8-fold for SOD2 and GPX3 respectively, P < 0.05 for
both genes, Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we found that both SOD2
and GPX3 were statistically significantly upregulated in clear
cell carcinomas compared with nonclear cell tumors (6- and
23.3-fold for SOD2 and GPX3 respectively, P < 0.05 for both
genes).
We next evaluated the expression of more Nrf2 target
genes in clear cell and nonclear cell EOCs using gene
expression data from a publicly available, clinically annotated ovarian cancer microarray dataset (8). Nrf2 target
genes were statistically significantly overexpressed in clear
cell EOCs compared with the other major EOCs histologic
types (Fig. 2B). The fact that expression of known Nrf2 target

tumors based on the Nrf2 pathway genes (Fig. 2C), all clear cell
tumors cluster together, suggesting that clear cell tumors have
a distinct genomic pattern of Nrf2 gene expression when
compared with nonclear cell tumors. The results of pathway
analysis and hierachical clustering did not change if additional
Nrf2 pathway genes were included in the analysis [i.e., those
present in the publicly available signature ("SINGH-NFE2L2TARGETS"].
Keap1 mutations in EOC
Heterozygous mutations in Keap1, associated with subsequent activation of the Nrf2 pathway, have been identified
in lung and biliary tract cancer (11–13). We therefore
amplified and sequenced all 5 protein-coding exons and
intron–exon boundaries of the Keap1 gene in 27 of the 30
EOC samples, with the results shown in Figures 3A and B
and Supplementary Table S3. We identified mutations associated with changes in evolutionarily conserved amino acids
(in Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Danio rerio (zebrafish),
Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila) in 4 of 14 (29%) clear cell
samples. Three clear cell tumors were heterozygous for the
mutant allele whereas the fourth was heterozygous for 2
different mutations. Similar to other tumor types, clear cell
EOC samples were heterozygous for Keap1 mutations, and
these mutations involved functionally important domains of
Keap1 protein, including the BTB, IVR, and KR regions of
Keap1 which are responsible for ubiquitination and binding
of Nrf2 (14–16). In contrast to clear cell cancer, we identified

www.aacrjournals.org

a missense mutation in only 1 of 13 of the nonclear cell
tumors, papillary serous, (8%), which contained the mutant
G–C allele associated with a highly conserved amino acid
change in the BTB domain.
All EOC tumors with Keap1 mutations exhibited nuclear
localization of Nrf2 by IHC (Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, 50% (11 of 22) of EOC tumors without Keap1 mutation also exhibited nuclear localization of Nrf2 protein
(2-sided Fisher's exact P ¼ 0.06).
Keap1 expression levels and Nrf2 gene sequencing in
Nrf2 immunopositive specimens
In addition to Keap1 mutations, we considered that Nrf2
pathway activation may also occur as a result of Keap1
downregulation or Nrf2 mutations. Therefore, we analyzed
the mRNA expression levels of Keap1 by quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and conducted sequencing of
Nrf2 gene to identify mutations in Nrf2 immunopositive
tumors. Table 2 summarizes the Keap1 expression data,
and the Keap1 and Nrf2 sequencing data in the Nrf2 immunopositive tumors.
As shown in Table 2, 3 tumors (all with clear cell histology)
with positive Nrf2 nuclear staining had absent Keap1 expression by qRT-PCR (i.e., Keap1 transcript was undetected by RTPCR in these samples after 55 amplification cycles). None of
these tumors harbored Keap1 mutations. We also sequenced
the Nrf2 gene in Nrf2 immunopositive tumor samples and no
Nrf2 sequence alterations were identified in these samples.

Results expressed as fold change from baseline. B, the effects of Keap1

represent mean  SE of triplicate experiments.

Overall, of 17 tumors with positive nuclear Nrf2 staining, 8
(47%) tumors had either Keap1 mutations (n ¼ 5) or absent
Keap1 mRNA expression (n ¼ 3). Of 11 clear cell tumors with
positive nuclear Nrf2 staining, 7 (64%) tumors had either Keap1
mutations (n ¼ 4) or absent Keap1 mRNA expression (n ¼ 3).
Activation of the Nrf2 pathway via siRNA knockdown of
Keap1
We assessed the effect of siRNA knockdown of Keap1, the
cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2, on the sensitivity of 36M2
ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. SiRNA against Keap1
was transfected into 36M2 cells (which harbor wild-type
Keap1) at a dose of 150 nmol/L. After 48 and 72 hours, siRNA
against Keap1 reduced the steady-state mRNA levels of Keap1
(assessed by real-time RT-PCR) to 40% of that observed in
untreated 36M2 cells or those transfected with the scrambled

5086

siRNA (Fig. 4A). SiRNA knockdown of Keap1 was maintained
at this level for 72 hours (Fig. 4A). To confirm that knockdown
of Keap1 allowed Nrf2 to activate transcription of its target
genes, we assessed expression of the Nrf2 target gene NADPH
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) after siRNA knockdown of
Keap1. siRNA against Keap1 produced a 2.5-fold and 10-fold
increase in NQO1 mRNA levels at 48 hours and 72 hours,
respectively, compared with cells treated with scrambled
siRNA or control, and remained upregulated at 96 hours after
transfection (Supplementary Fig. S1).
As shown in Figure 4B, transfection with Keap1 siRNA
induced relative resistance of 36M2 cells to carboplatin,
compared with 36M2 cells transfected with scrambled
siRNA or control 36M2 cells. For cells transfected with
Keap1 siRNA, scramble siRNA, and control, the IC50 to
carboplatin was 49.4, 11.5, and 12.1 mmol/L, respectively
(P < 0.05 for the difference between Keap1 siRNA and either
control group).

Correlation of Keap1–Nrf2 pathway with platinum
responsiveness and clinical outcome
We used our publicly available ovarian cancer microarray
dataset comprised of 64 advanced disease patients with EOC
to investigate whether there was a relationship between Nrf2
pathway activation, platinum resistance, and OS (9). Hierarchical clustering based on the expression levels of the Nrf2
pathway genes revealed 2 clusters/groups of patients
(Fig. 5A). The Nrf2 pathway was upregulated (Efron–
Tibshirani's GSA test P < 0.005) in the first group (Nrf2
pathway up) compared with the second group (Nrf2 pathway
down) of patients (heat map is shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2). The majority of clear cell EOCs (4 of 5, 80%)
clustered in the "Nrf2 pathway up" group and 1 clustered
in the "Nrf2 pathway down" group.
Patients in the Nrf2 pathway up group had a lower complete
clinical response rate to platinum, compared with patients in
the Nrf2 pathway down group (77% vs. 97%, respectively, 2sided Fisher's exact P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 5B). Furthermore, 42% of
patients in the Nrf2 pathway up group were platinum resistant, compared with 16% of patients in the Nrf2 pathway down
group (2-sided Fisher's exact P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 5B). Finally,
patients in the Nrf2 pathway up group had inferior OS
compared with patients in the Nrf2 pathway down group
(34 months vs. not yet reached, respectively, log rank P ¼
0.031, Fig. 5C). In multivariable analysis adjusted for known
prognostic factors, the HR for death for patients in the Nrf2
pathway up group was 2.42 (95% CI: 1.15–5.09; Supplementary
Table S4).

Discussion
Platinum compounds form electrophilic intermediates
that mediate DNA cross-linking and induce double-strand
DNA breaks. Because the cellular response to electrophilic
xenobiotics is partly mediated by Keap1–Nrf2 pathway, we
were interested in further defining the role that this pathway
might play in the development of drug resistance in EOC. We
report for the first time that Nrf2 is commonly localized to the

nucleus in EOC (Fig. 1), associated with evidence of downstream activation of Nrf2 target genes, resistance to platinum,
and mutations in its binding partner, Keap1. This effect was
most commonly observed for clear cell EOC, a subtype that is
already known to have a distinct molecular profile compared with other ovarian cancer histologies (17). Although
nuclear localization of Nrf2 by IHC has been reported in
non–small cell lung and head and neck cancers, this is the
first report to show that this phenomenon also occurs in
EOC (13, 18). The fact that expression of known Nrf2 target
genes was found to be upregulated more commonly in clear
cell EOCs compared with nonclear cell histologies (Fig. 2),
provides supportive evidence to suggest that the nuclear
location of Nrf2 in this ovarian cancer subtype may have
functional significance.
To assess whether activation of the Nrf2 pathway may be
partly responsible for mediating platinum resistance in EOC,
we evaluated the functional relationship between Nrf2 pathway activation and platinum resistance in the 36M2 ovarian
cancer cell line. Nrf2 pathway was induced via siRNA knockdown of its cytoplasmic inhibitor Keap1 (Fig. 4A), leading to
enhanced the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 and rendering
36M2 cells more resistant to carboplatin (Fig. 4B).
Keap1 mutations have been reported in some patients with
non–small cell lung cancer (13, 11), small cell lung cancer (11),
and biliary tract cancer (12). One study also reported that the
human Q293 breast cancer cell line harbors a Keap1 mutation
that encodes an inactive Keap1 protein (19). The majority of
these Keap1 mutations in cancer patients were heterozygous.

In our study, we identified mutations associated with changes
in amino acids in 5 (19%) of the 27 EOCs that were sequenced;
in 4 (29%) clear cell samples and 1 (8%) nonclear cell (papillary serous) cancer (Table 2). All EOC tumors with Keap1
mutations exhibited nuclear localization of Nrf2 by IHC in our
series. Three clear cell tumors were heterozygous for the
mutant allele whereas the fourth was heterozygous for 2
different mutations. Importantly, all 5 missense mutations
identified in the 4 clear cell tumors involved amino acids that
were evolutionary conserved in Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Danio rerio (zebrafish), Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila.
Similar to other tumor types, clear cell EOC samples were
heterozygous for Keap1 mutations, and these mutations
involved functionally relevant domains of Keap1 protein,
including the BTB, IVR, and KR regions of Keap1 which
are responsible for ubiquitination and binding of Nrf2 (14–
16). On the basis of the recently proposed 2-site substrate
recognition model for Keap1–Nrf2 interaction, formation of
an homodimer of 2 normal Keap1 subunits that associates
with 2 sites of Nrf2 is necessary for ubiquitination and
eventual degradation of Nrf2 (20). In this regard, it has been
reported that in tumors that are heterozygous for Keap1
mutations, the heterodimer between a wild-type Keap1 subunit and a mutant Keap1 subunit is inactive and unable to
repress Nrf2 function (11). Finally, there was 1 missense
mutation in 1 papillary serous tumor, which contained only
the mutant G–C allele, associated with a highly conserved
amino acid change in the BTB domain (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3).

We also evaluated whether other mechanisms (besides
Keap1 mutations) may be associated with Nrf2 pathway
activation in EOC. In this regard, downregulation of Keap1
and mutations in Nrf2 have been identified in lung cancer (21).
Therefore, we analyzed the expression levels of KEAP1 by
qRT-PCR and conducted sequencing of NRF2 gene to identify
mutations in the Nrf2 immunopositive tumors. No NRF2
sequence alterations were identified in the Nrf2 immunopositive tumors (Table 2). However, we found that there
were 3 tumors (all clear cell tumors) with positive Nrf2
nuclear staining that had absent Keap1 expression as
assessed by qRT-PCR (Table 2). None of these tumors
harbored Keap1 mutations. Thus, of 17 tumors with positive
nuclear Nrf2 staining, 8 (47%) tumors had either Keap1
mutations or absent Keap1 mRNA expression, and of 11
clear cell tumors with positive nuclear Nrf2 staining, 7 (64%)
tumors had either Keap1 mutations or absent Keap1 mRNA
expression.
Given the presence of Nrf2 pathway activation in at least
some patients with EOC, and the observation that activation
of Nrf2 pathway increases platinum resistance in 36M2 ovarian cancer cells, we investigated whether this pathway is
associated with clinical outcome in ovarian cancer using a
publicly available gene expression dataset of 64 patients with
advanced EOC. Patients with upregulated Nrf2 pathway had a
lower CCR rate after first-line therapy, and they were enriched
for platinum resistance. Furthermore, activation of Nrf2
pathway was associated with worse OS independent of standard prognostic factors such as age, grade, histology, stage,
and debulking status (Supplementary Table S4). Because the
majority of the 64 patients had papillary serous tumors, these
findings suggest that activation of the Nrf2 pathway may

correlate with platinum resistance not only in clear cell
EOC but also in other histologies.
In conclusion, the Nrf2 pathway is activated at baseline in
some patients with EOC, especially of the clear cell variety, and
may be partly involved in the development of chemoresistance
of this disease. Activation of Nrf2 pathway in EOC seems to be
associated with Keap1 mutations within highly conserved
domains of the Keap1 gene, raising the possibility that such
mutations may prove to be a surrogate for platinum resistance. Alternatively, activation of Nrf2 pathway may be associated with downregulation of Keap1 expression. If confirmed
in a larger numbers of patients, these findings also suggest
that Nrf2 may serve as an important therapeutic target for
novel drugs capable of preventing or reversing resistance to
chemotherapy in EOC.
