Abstract

Author Manuscript

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in human
cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR antibody that has been approved for use in oncology.
Previously we investigated mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab using a model derived from the
non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. We demonstrated that cetuximab-resistant clones
(CtxR) had increased nuclear localization of the EGFR. This process was mediated by Src family
kinases (SFK), and nuclear EGFR played a role in resistance to cetuximab. To better understand
SFK mediated nuclear translocation of EGFR, we investigated which SFK member(s) controlled
this process as well as the EGFR tyrosine residues that are involved. Analyses of mRNA and
protein expression indicated up-regulation of the SFK members Yes and Lyn in all CtxR clones.
Further, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that EGFR interacts with Yes and Lyn in CtxR
clones, but not in cetuximab-sensitive (CtxS) parental cells. Using RNAi interference, we found
that knockdown of either Yes or Lyn led to loss of EGFR translocation to the nucleus. Conversely,
overexpression of Yes or Lyn in low nuclear EGFR expressing CtxS parental cells led to increased
nuclear EGFR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed nuclear EGFR
complexes associated with the promoter of the known EGFR target genes B-Myb and iNOS.
Further, all CtxR clones exhibited up-regulation of B-Myb and iNOS at the mRNA and protein
levels. siRNAs directed at Yes or Lyn led to decreased binding of EGFR complexes to the B-Myb
and iNOS promoters based on ChIP analyses. SFKs have been shown to phosphorylate EGFR on
tyrosines 845 and 1101 (Y845 and Y1101) and mutation of Y1101, but not Y845, impaired
nuclear entry of the EGFR. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Yes and Lyn
phosphorylate EGFR at Y1101 which influences EGFR nuclear translocation in this model of
cetuximab resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK), provides cells with potent growth and survival signals that enable tumors to manifest
(1–3). Aberrant expression or activity of the EGFR is identified as a major etiological factor
in many human epithelial cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain cancer
(2, 4, 5). In the classical EGFR signaling pathway ligand binding to the EGFR allows for
receptor homo- or hetero-dimerization at the plasma membrane. This interaction activates
each receptor’s tyrosine kinase domain and induces autophosphorylation of each dimer’s
cytoplasmic tail. The phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR serves as docking sites
for numerous proteins that initiates key oncogenic pathways including the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways; however,
the activation of src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC), Protein
kinase C (PKC) and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) proteins
have also been documented (1, 6).

Author Manuscript

In addition to the classical signaling pathways initiated by the EGFR at the cell surface,
there is now an emerging novel signaling pathway influenced by EGFR located in the
nucleus. The full-length EGFR can be shuttled from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in
a series of well-defined steps (7–9). These events include receptor internalization to the
early endosome and interaction with importinβ1 via its tripartite nuclear localization
sequence (NLS), followed by COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking to the Golgi apparatus
and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10, 11). Once in the ER the EGFR-importinβ1
complex moves to the outer nuclear membrane where importinβ1 interacts with nucleoporin
62 lining the nuclear pore channel to shuttle the EGFR-importinβ1 complex to the inner
nuclear membrane. Here the complex interacts with the Sec61β translocon to be released
from the membrane into the nucleus (12, 13).
Within the nucleus, EGFR serves as a transcriptional co-activator for a series of tumor
promoting genes including cyclin D1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Aurora Kinase
A, B-Myb, COX2, c-Myc, Breast Cancer Related Protein (BCRP) and GRP78 (14–21).
Additionally, nuclear EGFR can phosphorylate and stabilize the proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) at the replication fork of the dividing cell (22), and activate DNA-PK to
enhance DNA repair (23).

Author Manuscript

High levels of nuclear EGFR correlate with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer,
oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer, ovarian cancer, and gallbladder cancer (24–28).
Nuclear EGFR also contributes to cancer cells resistance to cetuximab (29), gefitinib (20),
cisplatin and radiation therapy (30–33). Taken together these pieces of evidence suggest that
nuclear EGFR plays a role in the promotion of cancer and provides a rationale for studying
the mechanisms of EGFR nuclear translocation in order to target the nuclear functions of the
EGFR.

It is well established that SFKs are necessary for full activation of the EGFR (34, 35). Src
kinase is the prototype member of this family of non-RTKs that include Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck,
Hck Fgr, Blk and Yrk (36, 37). These SFKs mediate mitogenic signals from a variety of
RTKs (38, 39). It has been observed that SFKs can phosphorylate EGFR at both tyrosine
845 (Y845) and tyrosine 1101 (Y1101). EGFR Y845 is located in the activation loop of the
kinase domain that is highly conserved among other RTKs. Phosphorylation of EGFR Y845
appears to be critical for EGFR-mediated mitogenesis, and is critical for the phosphorylation
and activation of the STAT5b transcription factor (34, 40, 41). The second known Srcmediated phosphorylation site is Y1101, which lies within the carboxyl-terminal region of
the EGFR; however the function of Y1101 has not been fully elucidated (34). Oncogenic
cooperation between Src and EGFR has been well established in breast cancer (34, 42),
glioblastoma (43), HNSCC and NSCLC (44–47).

Author Manuscript

We established six clonal CtxR variants of the NCI-H226 NSCLC line (29, 48, 49). In
previous reports we found that CtxR clones had a dramatic increase in nuclear EGFR
localization, in addition to having increased SFK activity (29, 44). Further, we reported that
the SFK inhibitor dasatinib (BMS-354825, Sprycel™) could 1) block SFK activation, 2)
decrease nuclear EGFR translocation, 3) increase plasma membrane levels of the EGFR, and
4) re-sensitize CtxR cell lines to cetuximab. Collectively these findings suggest that SFKs
play a crucial role in nuclear translocation of the EGFR in this model of cetuximabresistance. However, the specific SFKs involved in the mediation of EGFR nuclear
translocation and how they mediate this process are unknown.

Author Manuscript

In the current study we demonstrate that CtxR clones had increased expression of the SFKs
Yes and Lyn. Both Yes and Lyn were strongly associated with EGFR in CtxR clones as
compared to the CtxS parental cell line. Depletion of either Yes or Lyn kinase decreased
EGFR nuclear translocation, and reduced phosphorylation at Y845 and Y1101 of the EGFR.
Reciprocally, overexpression of Yes or Lyn increased EGFR nuclear translocation in CtxS
parental cell line. Furthermore, mutation of Y1101 of the EGFR impaired its nuclear
translocation. Collectively these data suggest that Yes, Lyn and Y1101 of the EGFR are
involved in EGFR nuclear translocation in this model of acquired resistance to cetuximab.

RESULTS
The SFK inhibitor Dasatinib blocks nuclear translocation of the EGFR

Author Manuscript

We have previously reported that CtxR clones have increased nuclear EGFR and activation
of SFKs (Figure 1A, 1B) (29, 48). Using this model, we determined the effects of the SFK
inhibitor dasatinib on the phosphorylation status of the EGFR in three CtxR clones (HC1,
HC4 and HC8) and the CtxS parental clone (HP) after treatment with 100 nM of dasatinib
for 24 hours. Dasatinib inhibited the full activation of SFKs as indicated by the loss of
phospho-Y419 and decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR at the known SFK
phosphorylation sites Y845 and Y1101 (Figure 1B). Also, treatment with dasatinib led to
modest increases in steady state expression of total SFKs in all CtxR clones.
To determine the effects of dasatinib treatment on nuclear translocation of EGFR, we treated
the CtxR clones and the CtxS parental clone with 100 nM of dasatinib for 24 hours followed

by nuclear fractionation. As illustrated in Figure 1C, dasatinib treatment reduced EGFR
nuclear translocation in CtxR clones. The CtxS parental clone has very low levels of nuclear
EGFR and dasatinib treatment had no effect. Thus, the inhibition of SFK activity decreased
the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y845 and Y1101 as well as impaired nuclear entry of the
EGFR. These results suggested that SFK phosphorylation of EGFR may play a role in
inducing its nuclear translocation.
Yes and Lyn are overexpressed and associate with the EGFR in CtxR clones

Author Manuscript

Based on our previous findings with clonal CtxR variants of the NCI-H226 NSCLC line we
hypothesized that SFK member(s) may regulate EGFR nuclear translocation. To identify the
specific SFKs that are necessary for EGFR nuclear translocation, we performed microarray
analysis comparing CtxS HP parental cells to the three CtxR clones (HC1, HC4 and HC8).
Microarray analysis demonstrated a ~4-fold up-regulation of Yes and Lyn kinases and ~3fold down-regulation of Src kinase in all of three CtxR cells (data not shown). Other SFK
family members did not exhibit significant expression level changes in the three CtxR clones
(HC1, HC4 and HC8) compared to sensitive parental line (HP).

Author Manuscript

To validate the microarray findings we performed qPCR analysis. These results confirmed
the microarray data indicating up-regulation of Lyn (~ 3-fold) and Yes (~1.5 fold), and
down-regulation of Src kinase (~2-fold) in all three CtxR clones (Figure 2A). Next, we
examined if these increased mRNA levels reflected total protein levels in CtxR when
compared to CtxS cells. We found that total protein levels of Yes and Lyn were increased
1.3- to 2.1-fold in CtxR clones compared to parental cells (Figure 2B). Finally, we
investigated whether EGFR associated with Yes and Lyn. Immunoprecipitation analysis of
EGFR binding partners indicated that EGFR displayed increased association to Yes and Lyn
in all three CtxR clones as compared to the CtxS HP cell line (Figure 2C). Collectively, these
results indicate that Yes and Lyn are up-regulated in CtxR clones and have increased
association with the EGFR.
Yes and Lyn are necessary for nuclear translocation of EGFR in CtxR cells

Author Manuscript

To further investigate if Yes and/or Lyn expression altered EGFR activation and nuclear
translocation we performed gene-silencing experiments using siRNA directed against Yes or
Lyn in CtxR clones (HC1, HC4 and HC8). CtxS cells were not included in these siRNA
studies because the cells have negligible levels of nuclear EGFR. After treatment with
siYES or siLYN in CtxR clones for 72 hours we observed decreased phosphorylation of
EGFR Y845 (70–99%) and EGFR Y1101 (40–85%) relative to control non-targeting siRNA
(NT) (Figure 3A). Moreover, siYES and siLYN decreased the nuclear localization of EGFR
in CtxR clones (Figure 3B).
Knockdown studies of Yes or Lyn in cells with high nuclear EGFR expression led to
decreased nuclear EGFR levels. Therefore, we hypothesized that the overexpression of Yes
or Lyn could increase the level of nuclear EGFR in a cell line with low levels of EGFR in
the nucleus. To test this hypothesis we overexpressed Yes or Lyn in CtxS cells, which
express low-levels of nuclear EGFR. First, Yes and Lyn were cloned into mammalian
expression vectors, expressed in CHO-K1 cells and characterized for increased total Yes and

Lyn protein expression and activity (Figure 4A). Comparable increases in Yes and Lyn
expression and activation were observed in CtxS cells after transfection compared to vector
only (Figure 4B). Consistent with siRNA observations, transient transfection of Yes or Lyn
into CtxS cells significantly increased (3~3.5 fold) nuclear EGFR translocation (Figure 4C).
Interestingly, Yes and Lyn were also detected in nucleus of HP cells after transfection. To
determine if CtxR cells with increased of nuclear EGFR also express more Yes and Lyn in
the nucleus compared to CtxS cells, we determined nuclear Yes and Lyn levels in CtxR
clones and CtxS cells. As seen with EGFR, increased levels of both Yes and Lyn were found
in the nucleus of CtxR clones compared to CtxS cells (Figure 4D). These siRNA and
overexpression results suggest that Yes and Lyn play a role in EGFR nuclear translocation.
Depletion of Yes or Lyn decreases binding of nuclear EGFR complexes to the B-Myb and
iNOS promoter regions

Author Manuscript

Nuclear EGFR and various transcription factor complexes have been shown to bind
promoter regions and regulate the transcription of multiple genes including cyclin D1,
iNOS, B-Myb, Aurora Kinase A, COX2, c-Myc, BCRP and GRP78 (14–21). To confirm
that nuclear EGFR complexes in CtxR clones bound to known EGFR target gene promoters
we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis of
the B-Myb and iNOS promoters. We demonstrated that CtxR clones have increased EGFR
association with the B-Myb (3–9-fold increase in EGFR binding) and iNOS (6–12-fold
increase in EGFR binding) promoter regions as compared to CtxS parental cell line (Figure
5A). These results indicate that nuclear EGFR complexes bind known EGFR target
promoters in CtxR clones more strongly than in CtxS HP cells.

Author Manuscript

Given the high binding of nuclear EGFR complexes to the B-Myb and iNOS promoters we
performed qPCR to determine whether this binding resulted in increased expression of BMyb and iNOS genes as previously reported (15, 16). Results in Figure 5B indicated that BMyb mRNA expression was increased approximately 4-fold in all CtxR clones as compared
to CtxS parental cells. Whereas, iNOS mRNA expression was increased 4–11-fold in CtxR
clones when compared to CtxS parental cells. Furthermore, B-Myb protein expression was
up-regulated approximately 3-fold and iNOS protein expression was up-regulated 2–14-fold
in CtxR clones (Figure 5C). Using the CtxR HC4 clone we demonstrate that silencing of Yes
or Lyn using siRNA reduced nuclear EGFR complex formation with the B-Myb and iNOS
promoters as detected by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 5D). Additionally, the protein expression of
both B-Myb and iNOS were decreased (60–70 %) after siYES or siLYN transfection
compared to control non-targeting siRNA in HC4 (Figure 5D). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that CtxR clones with high levels of nuclear EGFR associate more strongly with
known EGFR regulated promoter regions, and that these association (demonstrated with BMyb and iNOS) can be prevented upon depletion of Yes or Lyn.
EGFR Y1101 is involved in nuclear translocation
Analysis of known SFK phosphorylation sites on the EGFR showed increased
phosphorylation of Y845 and Y1101 in CtxR clones (Figure 1B). However, the relevance of
these two tyrosine sites for EGFR nuclear translocation is unknown. To determine if
phosphorylation of one or both of these tyrosine residues is involved in EGFR nuclear

translocation, MCF-7 breast cancer cells (which express very low EGFR levels) were
transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type EGFR (WT) or the following EGFR
mutants: EGFR-Y845F or EGFR-Y1101F. Immunoprecipitation of WT and mutant EGFR
followed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against pEGFRY845 or pEGFRY1101
showed reduced phosphorylation of Y845 and Y1101. (Figure 6A). To induce nuclear
translocation of the EGFR we treated the transfected cells with EGF for 45 minutes prior to
cell lysis and nuclear fractionation. The results of this experiment indicated that EGF was
able to induce nuclear translocation of EGFR in both EGFR-WT and EGFR-Y845F mutant
cells (Figure 6B). However, EGF-induced EGFR nuclear translocation was diminished
~70% in EGFR-Y1101F mutant cells as compared to EGFR-WT expressing cells (Figure
6B). Furthermore qPCR analysis revealed that B-Myb and iNOS mRNA expression were
downregulated in cells transfected with EGFR-Y1101F mutant compared to EGFR-WT
transfected cells (Figure 6C). Collectively, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of
Y1101 is important for the nuclear translocation of EGFR while the phosphorylation of
Y845 does not appear to be essential for this process.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The nuclear localization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been observed for over 20
years, however only in the last 10 years has research begun to focus on how they translocate
from the cell surface to the nucleus and what functions they perform there. All four HER
family members have been identified in the nucleus of various types of human cancer cells
and tumor specimens (9, 50–53). Currently, eight target genes of nuclear EGFR have been
identified (14–21), and nuclear EGFR has been correlated with resistance to cetuximab,
radiation, cisplatin and gefitinib therapies (20, 23, 29–33). Collectively, these results suggest
an emerging role of the nuclear EGFR signaling network in cancer progression and response
to therapeutic modalities.
Several studies have examined how EGFR moves from the plasma membrane to the nucleus
of the cell. It has been shown that the full-length EGFR can be shuttled from the plasma
membrane to the nucleus through associations with importinβ1, the nuclear pore complex,
and the Sec61β translocon (7, 10, 13). Despite this mechanism of EGFR nuclear
translocation, the early events at the plasma membrane that may serve as critical initiating
signals for the movement of the EGFR to the nucleus have yet to be defined and form the
basis of the current study.

Author Manuscript

To further elucidate the molecular requirements for EGFR nuclear transport we utilized a
previously established model of acquired resistance to cetuximab in the NCI-H226 NSCLC
cell line (48). In this model, cetuximab-resistant cells were observed to have increased levels
of nuclear EGFR as compared to their cetuximab-sensitive parental cells, making it an ideal
model for investigating events involved in nuclear translocation of the EGFR (29).
Additionally, cetuximab-resistant cell lines were shown to have increased expression and
activity of SFKs (44). Further investigation using dasatinib, an inhibitor of SFKs,
demonstrated that SFK activity was necessary for the nuclear transport of EGFR in this
model of cetuximab-resistance (29). In the current study, we identified Yes and Lyn to have
increased expression and association with the EGFR (Figure 2). This result is consistent

with other reports identifying Yes and Lyn interaction and activation of the EGFR (54–57).
In addition, loss of Yes and Lyn expression using siRNA technology, led to reduced
phosphorylation of Y845 and Y1101 of the EGFR and more importantly impaired nuclear
EGFR accumulation (Figure 3). Consistent with this observation, overexpression of Yes and
Lyn in CtxS cells that express low-levels of nuclear EGFR significantly increased (3~3.5
fold) nuclear EGFR translocation (Figure 4B). ChIP assays demonstrated that nuclear EGFR
complexes bind to B-Myb and iNOS promoter regions and siYES and siLYN decreased
binding to these promoters (Figure 5). Mutagenesis studies of Y845 and Y1101 indicated
that Y1101, not Y845, might be necessary for nuclear translocation of the EGFR from the
membrane to the nucleus (Figure 6). Recently, Jaganathan et al. reported that Src and EGFR
associate in the nucleus with the transcription factor STAT3 to regulate the expression of the
c-Myc gene in pancreatic cancer (19). Consistent with this report, we found that Yes or Lyn
not only increased the levels of nuclear EGFR but also had increased nuclear localization
themselves, suggesting that they may have been imported into the nucleus with the EGFR.
Collectively, these studies provide evidence for the role of SFKs in mediating nuclear
translocation of the EGFR. However, it remains to be investigated whether Yes or Lyn are
solely responsible for this nuclear translocation, or if SFKs exhibit a functional redundancy
where the overexpression of one or more SFK may result in the induction of nuclear EGFR
in various cancers.

Author Manuscript

Y845 and Y1101 of the EGFR are phosphorylated by SFKs (34). Biscardi et al. utilized a
GST bound SH2 domain of the c-Src protein to demonstrate its specific binding to the
EGFR via affinity chromatography (34). Subsequently, these investigators identified and
validated that EGFR was indeed phosphorylated by c-Src at Y845 and Y1101. Breast cancer
cell lines with high levels of Src activity also had increased levels of phospho Y845 and
Y1101 of the EGFR. Researchers further showed that phospho-Y845 was necessary for full
EGFR activation and EGF-induced DNA synthesis (34). This study represented a landmark
finding by identifying novel Src phosphorylation sites on the EGFR and the role of tyrosine
845 in the complete activation of the EGFR. Further studies looking at the function of EGFR
Y845 demonstrated that Y845 mediated EGFR binding to the mitochondrial protein
cytochrome c oxidase subunit II at the mitochondria; however, EGFR Y845 was not
necessary for its movement to the mitochondria (58). These findings support our data that
EGFR Y845 may not be required for the intracellular trafficking of the EGFR.

Author Manuscript

In the current study, we corroborate findings of Biscardi et al. by showing that Y845 and
Y1101 are Src specific phosphorylation sites through the use of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib
(Figure 1B). In addition, siRNA directed towards Yes and Lyn decreased the
phosphorylation of EGFR Y845 and Y1101 (Figure 3A). Our data further suggests that
Y1101, not Y845, may be a critical molecular determinant in the localization of nuclear
EGFR as indicated by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 6B). It should be noted, however,
that mutation of Y1101 did not completely block translocation of the EGFR to the nucleus,
suggesting that other post-translational modifications of the EGFR may be necessary.
Recent evidence has identified another key phosphorylation site on the EGFR, serine 229
(S229), as being necessary for EGFR translocation to the nucleus (20). It was reported that
the serine/threonine kinase AKT can influence the nuclear translocation of the EGFR by
phosphorylating S229 on the EGFR in a model of gefitinib resistance. In this model,

gefitinib-resistant A431 cells have both increased AKT activity and increased nuclear EGFR
as compared to gefitinib-sensitive A431 cells. Using an antibody that recognizes the
phosphorylated consensus motif of AKT substrates and subsequent mass spectrometry,
Huang et al. revealed that EGFR was phosphorylated by AKT at S229. Inhibition of AKT
kinase activity prevented this phosphorylation event, and decreased the nuclear transport of
EGFR providing evidence for the role of alternative kinases and post-translational
modifications of the EGFR that indeed affect its nuclear translocation. Collectively, these
findings suggest that the phosphorylation of the EGFR on Y1101 by Yes and Lyn together
with AKT phosphorylation of S229 may be critical molecular determinants that influence
the nuclear localization of the EGFR.

EGFR is tightly linked to the etiology of HNSCC, NSCLC, CRC, breast and brain cancers.
Accordingly, five EGFR inhibitors, three tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and two monoclonal
antibodies have been developed for clinical use to inhibit EGFR activation and downstream
signaling. Despite the successes of these agents, many tumors do not respond to EGFR
inhibition, or eventually become resistant to this therapeutic strategy. Accumulating
evidence suggests that nuclear EGFR plays a role in resistance to radiation, cetuximab,
cisplatin and gefitinib therapies (20, 23, 29–33). The mechanisms for how nuclear EGFR
leads to this resistance are not clear. However work from our laboratory suggests that
nuclear translocation can protect EGFR from the inhibitory effects of cetuximab causing
resistance to this therapy (29). The results presented in this study provide a potential
mechanism for the key molecules involved in nuclear localization of the EGFR providing
rational targets to prevent nuclear translocation and thus nuclear function of the EGFR.

Author Manuscript

In summary, the data presented in the current study has identified the SFKs Yes and Lyn to
play a crucial role in nuclear translocation of the EGFR in a model of cetuximab-resistance.
In addition, the SFK phosphorylation site Y1101 of the EGFR appears to be involved in
translocation of the EGFR from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. These findings are of
instrumental value in understanding the molecular requirements for nuclear EGFR transport,
and for potentially targeting nuclear EGFR in the future.

cytoplasmic lysis buffer and re-suspended in the same buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl to
extract nuclear proteins. After sonication and vortex, the extracted sample was centrifuged at
15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Whole cell protein lysate was obtained by tween-20 lysis buffer
(50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 1mM BGP and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin
and aprotinin). Samples were sonicated and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.
Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF
membrane (Millipore), and analyzed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibody.
Proteins were detected via incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL
chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA),
ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Promega Cooperation, Madison, WI, USA), SuperSignal*
West Dura Extended Duration Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal* West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA).

Microarray analysis

Cells were lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% Deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1
mM PMSF, 1mM BGP and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates containing 0.5
mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1 μg of anti-mouse EGFR antibody
(Invitrogen) or normal mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology). After adding 25 μl of
protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz), cell lysates were incubated for another 2 hours at
4°C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed several times with
NP-40 lysis buffer. The captured immunocomplexes were then eluted by boiling the beads
in 2x SDS sample buffer for 5 minutes and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described
above.

Total RNAs extracted from HP, HC1, HC4 and HC8 using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA, USA). Gene expression profiling using the HT-HG-U133 Human Genome
Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) containing over 22,000 well characterized genes.
After RMA normalization, data were analyzed using Partek Discovery Suite (St. Louis, MO,
USA) and signature genes were genes increased or decreased > 2-fold expression levels in
three CtxR clones (HC1, HC4 and HC8) compared to sensitive parental line (HP) with p
value <0.05.

cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR
cDNA from total RNA of HP, HC1, HC4 and HC8 were synthesized using SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was
performed using a Bio-Rad iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
using the iQ Supermix as recommended by manufacturer. All reactions were performed in
triplicate. The sequences of primer sets used for this analysis are as follows: Lyn-F: 5′GGCTCCAGA AGCAATCAACT-3′, Lyn-R: 5′-TCACGTCGGCATTAGTTCTC-3′; YesF: 5′-CTAGTAACA AAGGGCCGAGTG-3′, Yes-R: 5′Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 07.

Cells were fixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1 % for 15 min at room
temperature, stopped fixation by 1.25 M glycine for 5 min. Subsequently, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS and collected in the tube and centrifuge at 4°C for 5 min. The cell pellets
was lysed in cell lysis buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40 and 10 mM
sodium pyrophosphate) by a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifuge, supernatant was
removed, and the nuclei pellets were lysed in nuclei lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 8.1,
10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate). The lysate was sonicated on
ice to shear DNA, and the supernatant was pre-cleared with protein A/G agarose beads
(Santa Cruz) in dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl,
1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate) for 1h at 4°C. The precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubating with protein A/G beads containing 1
ug of anti-EGFR antibody or IgG and rotated at 4°C for overnight. The beads were washed
with wash buffer I (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% SDS and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate), wash buffer II (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and 10 mM sodium
pyrophosphate), wash buffer III (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 1%
NP-40, 1% deoxycholic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate) and TE buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate). The bound protein was
eluted twice with elute buffer (100 mM NaHCO3 and 1% SDS). Then, 5 M NaCl was added
to the pooled eluent and incubated at 68°C overnight. The DNA was recovered and purified
using DNA purification kit (Qiagen). The purified chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA was
used as a template for the qPCR of the promoter regions using the following primer pairs: BMyb-F: 5′-CTGGTCTTAGCTACCCGTGAG TTGA–3′ and B-Myb-R: 5′CAGGAGTATCCCACATAGCGAACAC-3′ (15), iNOS-F: 5′TGATGAACTGCCACCTTGGAC–3′ and iNOS-R: 5 ′-TTCACCCAACCC
ACCTCTTTC-3′ (16). The qPCR program was: 95°C for 3min, followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s for B-Myb or 55°C for 30 s for iNOS. The qPCR was
performed using the iQ5 Real-time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad).

(A) Immunoprecipitation of total EGFR followed by immunoblotting with anti-pEGFR
Y845, anti-pEGFR Y1101 or pan-EGFR antibodies. MCF7 Cells overexpressing EGFRWT, EGFR-Y845F or EGFR-Y1101F were harvested after stimulation with 100 ng/mL of
EGF for 45 min. A total of 500 ug of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with pan-EGFR
antibody. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. (B) Mutation of Y1101, but not Y845, reduces
the nuclear localization of EGFR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cells were transiently
transfected with plasmids encoding the EGFR wild-type (WT), EGFR-Y845F, EGFRY1101F or vector only. 48hr post-transfection the cells were incubated with EGF (100
ng/ml) for 45min, harvested for whole cell lysate, non-nuclear, and nuclear protein, and
fractionated on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for indicated proteins. Histone H3
and α-tubulin were used as loading and purity controls for the nuclear and non-nuclear
fractions, respectively. (C) B-Myb and iNOS mRNA levels were down-regulated in HC4
cells transfected with EGFR-Y1101F mutant compared to EGFR-WT transfected cells by
qPCR. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the EGFR wild-type (WT)
or EGFR-Y1101F. 24hr post-transfection the cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for
45min, and harvested for RNA. The mRNA expression of B-Myb and iNOS was determined
by qPCR.
