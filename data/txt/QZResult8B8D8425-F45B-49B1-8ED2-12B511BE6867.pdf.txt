BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that the humanized clivatuzumab tetraxetan (hPAM4) antibody targets pancreatic ductal
carcinoma selectively. After a trial of radioimmunotherapy that determined the maximum tolerated dose of single-dose yttrium-90labeled hPAM4 (90Y-hPAM4) and produced objective responses in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma, the authors
studied fractionated radioimmunotherapy combined with low-dose gemcitabine in this disease. METHODS: Thirty-eight previously
untreated patients (33 patients with stage IV disease and 5 patients with stage III disease) received gemcitabine 200 mg/m2 weekly
for 4 weeks with 90Y-hPAM4 given weekly in Weeks 2, 3, and 4 (cycle 1), and the same cycle was repeated in 13 patients (cycles 2-4).
In the first part of the study, 19 patients received escalating weekly 90Y doses of 6.5 mCi/m2, 9.0 mCi/m2, 12.0 mCi/m2, and 15.0 mCi/
m2. In the second portion, 19 additional patients received weekly doses of 9.0 mCi/m2 or 12.0 mCi/m2. RESULTS: Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia (according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events) developed in 28 of 38 patients after cycle 1 and in all retreated patients; no grade >3 nonhematologic toxicities occurred.
Fractionated dosing of cycle 1 allowed almost twice the radiation dose compared with single-dose radioimmunotherapy. The maximum tolerated dose of 90Y-hPAM4 was 12.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks for cycle 1, with 9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks for subsequent cycles, and that dose will be used in future trials. Six patients (16%) had partial responses according to computed
tomography-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and 16 patients (42%) had stabilization as their best response (58%
disease control). The median overall survival was 7.7 months for all 38 patients, including 11.8 months for those who received repeated
cycles (46% [6 of 13 patients] 1 year), with improved efficacy at the higher radioimmunotherapy doses. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated
radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-hPAM4 and low-dose gemcitabine demonstrated promising therapeutic activity and manageable myeC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Despite considerable efforts to improve the management
of pancreatic ductal cancer (PDC), the only approved
treatments for advanced disease offer minimal survival
benefit (median survival, approximately 6 months).1-3
Recently, two multi-drug combinations reportedly
improved survival but with substantial toxicities.4,5 In
preclinical models, pancreatic cancer has been responsive
to radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) with radiolabeled clivatuzumab tetraxetan (PAM4),6,7 a monoclonal antibody
that specifically targets a mucin antigen that is produced
in >85% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas and is absent in
normal pancreas.8-10 Hence, the PAM4 antibody was
humanized (hPAM4), and a chelate conjugate was labeled
with yttrium-90 (90Y-hPAM4), a therapeutic b-emitting
radionuclide with an effective mean radiation path length
of approximately 5 mm that is suitable for bulky tumors.
On the basis of clinical experience with external
radiotherapy and other studies using 90Y-labeled antibodies,11 we speculated that fractionated doses could deliver
more radiation than a single bolus. Preclinical studies also
indicated enhanced antitumor activity when 90Y-hPAM4
was combined with gemcitabine,12-14 a known radiosensitizer.15 Clinically, low doses of gemcitabine with external
radiotherapy were tolerated.16 In the first phase 1 trial of
single-dose hPAM4 RAIT, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was identified as 20 mCi/m2 (740 megabecquerels [MBq]/m2), with expected dose-limiting myelotoxicity.17 Despite receiving only a single administration,
several patients had an objective response. Hence, in the
current study, we examined fractionated RAIT using 90YhPAM4 combined with low-dose gemcitabine in patients
with advanced PDC. The overall objective of the study
was to determine the MTD of this combination as firstline therapy. With escalating RAIT doses and a constant
gemcitabine dose, patients optionally received repeated
cycles. Correlative 18F-deoxyglucose–positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET) and CA19-9 serum titer
changes also were evaluated. The results would determine
the dose schedule for future trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DESIGN
The primary objectives were to evaluate the feasibility,
safety, tolerability, and MTD of fractionated 90Y-hPAM4
in combination with low-dose gemcitabine (200 mg/m2)
in a single cycle or in optional repeated cycles. Secondary
objectives included assessment of tumor targeting, biodistribution, organ dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, immuno5498

genicity, and efficacy (as determined according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST],
changes in CA19-9 serum titers, and survival).
PATIENTS
Previously untreated adults with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage III PDC (locally advanced, unresectable; N ¼ 5) or stage IV PDC (metastatic; N ¼ 33)
had to have a Karnofsky performance status 70 and
adequate hematologic parameters (eg, hemoglobin 11
g/dL, absolute neutrophil count 2.0  109/L, platelets
150  109/L). Additional eligibility requirements
included life expectancy >3 months, no known history of
active cardiac or pulmonary disease, no major surgery
within 4 weeks, and adequate renal and hepatic function
at study entry (creatinine and bilirubin levels 1.5 times
the institutional upper limit of normal and aspartate and
alanine aminotransferase levels 2.0 times the institutional upper limit of normal). Patients were excluded if
they had disease that was metastatic to the central nervous
system; a single tumor mass that measured >10 cm in
greatest dimension; grade >2 anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
or signs of intestinal obstruction; known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or C positivity; or other
concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that could
confound study interpretation or prevent the completion
of study procedures.
The institutional review board at each participating
site approved the study, and written informed consent
was obtained from all patients. This study is registered as
National Clinical Trial NCT00603863.
Treatment

Each treatment cycle was 4 weeks (Fig. 1). A 10-mg kit

acid (DOTA)-conjugated hPAM4 was labeled at local
radiopharmacies.17,18 Patients received indium-111-labeled hPAM4 (111In-hPAM4) (3-5 mCi, 111-185 MBq)
the first week to assess pharmacokinetics, antibody biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry estimates for 90YhPAM4, which was administered intravenously over 10
minutes without premedication once weekly for the next
3 weeks. Patients received gemcitabine (200 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes) once weekly for 4 weeks at least
2 days after the radioimmunoconjugate to permit
adequate antibody accumulation at tumor sites before initiating radiosensitization based on prior studies.12-14
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined for each
treatment cycle as grade 4 hematologic toxicity that lasted
7 days or failure to recover to grade 1 within 12 weeks of
completing a cycle, allowing supportive measures to aid
recovery. Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity of any duration and grade 3 toxicity that lasted 5 days also were
considered DLTs. Transfusions and growth factors were
permitted. At the discretion of the investigator, patients
who completed a treatment cycle without DLT or overt
progression of disease were eligible to receive additional
treatment cycles at the same dose level after their hematologic toxicity recovered to grade 1 (typically 4-8 weeks
later), which was at the discretion of the investigator.
A standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation design was used to
determine the MTD of the 90Y dosing for the initial treatment
cycle, exploring dose levels of 6.5 mCi/m2 (241 MBq/m2),
9.0 mCi/m2 (333 MBq/m2), 12.0 mCi/m2 (481 MBq/m2),
and 15.0 mCi/m2 (555 MBq/m2) weekly for 3 weeks in the
first part of the trial. In the second part, additional patients were
enrolled to gain further experience at the 90Y MTD of the first
cycle (12 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks) and at the next lower
level (9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks).
Study Assessments

Pharmacokinetics, imaging and dosimetry procedures have
been reported.19-21 Evidence of tumor targeting was not
required. To proceed with treatment, dose estimates for
each cycle were required to be <300 centigrays (cGy) for
red bone marrow, <3000 cGy for liver, and <2000 cGy
for kidney and lung.20,21 Anti-hPAM4 antibody response
(HAHA) was assessed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and at monthly intervals.17
Adverse events were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA Maintenance and Support Services Organization, Northrop
Grumman Information Systems, Chantilly, Va) and were
graded according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Cancer

Events. Serum chemistry levels, physical examinations, vital
signs, and urine analyses were performed over 12 weeks after treatment, and weekly or more frequent blood counts
were obtained for grade 2 cytopenias. Serum levels of
CA19-9 were obtained at baseline and then at 4 weeks, 8
weeks, and 12 weeks after treatment. Computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated by local radiologists at baseline and then until progression or at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and
12 weeks after RAIT, and the best treatment response at
any of these evaluations was classified according to
RECIST as a complete response (CR), a partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).22
18
F-FDG-PET or PET/CT imaging was optional.
Statistical Analyses

Response rates were summarized using descriptive statistics. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the first
90
Y-hPAM4 dose to death or last contact. The duration of
response was determined from the onset to the earliest
occurrence of progression, death, or last contact. The
probability of survival was estimated using the KaplanMeier method.
RESULTS
Forty-two adult patients with untreated stage III or IV
PDC were enrolled. All had CT-measurable disease, primarily involving the pancreas and/or liver, and most had
elevated baseline CA19-9 serum levels (Table 1).
Treatment

Sixteen patients were treated during the first part of the trial
and received their initial treatment cycle of 90Y-hPAM4
weekly for 3 weeks at doses of 6.5 mCi/m2 (N ¼ 4), 9.0
mCi/m2 (N ¼ 4), 12.0 mCi/m2 (N ¼ 3), and 15.0 mCi/m2
(N ¼ 5). There were no DLTs except for 1 patient at the
15.0 mCi/m2 dose level who had grade 4 platelets that lasted
>7 days. However, further enrollment at the 15.0 mCi/m2
dose level was not pursued, because 2 patients who initially
were assigned to this level had required a dose reduction to
meet the protocol-defined radiation dose restrictions to red
bone marrow. Thus, after enrolling 3 more patients at the
12.0 mCi/m2 dose level without DLT and without having
to reduce the dose because of dosimetry concerns, the MTD
for the initial treatment cycle effectively was declared as 12.0
mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. Nineteen additional patients
were then treated during the second part of the study, including 11 patients at the MTD of 12.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3
weeks and 8 patients at the next lower level (9.0 mCi/m2
weekly for 3 weeks), the latter patients being added because
of concern that treatment at the single-cycle MTD level
would compromise repeated cycles at the same dose level.

In total, 38 patients were treated, including 14 who
had overt PD on CT scans at their first post-treatment
evaluation and were ineligible for additional cycles.
Although retreatment of the other 24 patients was at the
investigator’s discretion, 11 patients were either removed
from the study either to hospice or to pursue other treatment options. Thus, 25 patients received only 1 cycle,
whereas 13 received 1 to 3 more treatment cycles, all at
the same 90Y dose level as their first cycle (Table 2).
Treatment was well tolerated, and no infusion reactions
were reported. Thus, as expected, the main toxicity was
hematologic, and there were dose-limiting cytopenias,
which are detailed below. No abnormal patterns of
changes occurred in standard serum chemistries, and no
grade 3/4 adverse events were reported except for several
isolated elevations of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase,
or bilirubin, consistent with hepatic involvement, biliary
obstruction, and other abdominal disease complications
(data not shown). Most of the adverse events reported
reflected gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary complications,
pain or constitutional complaints expected in this population with advanced PDC, or cytopenias expected from
treatment with RAIT and gemcitabine. Fifteen patients
had 17 serious adverse events, including biliary or gastrointestinal obstruction (N ¼ 5); febrile neutropenia (N ¼
3); and anemia, pneumonia, pretreatment cerebrovascular
events, splenic abscess, mental status change, pleural effusion, ascites, hyponatremia, and prolonged thrombocytopenia complicated by rectal bleeding attributed to
gastrointestinal tumor invasion (N ¼ 1 each). Thirteen
patients had 19 infections, which were treated with either
intravenous antibiotics (febrile neutropenia, N ¼ 3; pneumonia, ascending cholangitis, splenic abscess, urinary
tract infection, N ¼ 1 each) or orally (thrush, N ¼ 4; urinary tract infection, N ¼ 3; superficial lesions, N ¼ 2;
shingles, upper respiratory infection, Helicobacter pylori,
N ¼ 1 each). No therapy-related major bleeding or other
significant adverse events occurred.
Myelosuppression and Dose-Limiting Toxicity

For the 38 treated patients, grade 4 anemia occurred only
at the highest dose level, and grade 3 anemia was infrequent. However, grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia developed in 20 of 38 patients (53%) after cycle 1
and developed in all retreated patients. For patients with
grade 3/4 events, the median time from the first dose of
90
Y-hPAM4 to their nadir was 3.8 weeks for platelets and
4.2 weeks for neutrophils during the first cycle, with similar times to nadirs after subsequent cycles (data not

a
Of 38 treated patients, 25 patients received 1 cycle only; whereas 13 patients were retreated and received 2 cycles (N ¼ 11), 3 cycles (N ¼ 1), or 4 cycles (N
¼ 1). The intention was for patients to receive retreatment at the same dose level as the first treatment cycle; however, 2 patients had minor dose reductions
in their second cycle, including 1 patient who received 4.5 mCi/m2 instead of 6.5 mCi/m2 at the physician’s discretion and 1 patient who received 13.1 mCi/
m2 instead of 15.0 mCi/m2 to avoid exceeding normal organ radiation dose limits.
b
The 5 treated patients with stage III disease included 1 patient who received 2 cycles at 9.0 mCi/m2; 1 patient who received 1 cycle and 2 patients who
received 2 cycles at 12.0 mCi/m2; and 1 patient who received 1 cycle at 15.0 mCi/m2.

shown). For cycle 1, the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia among the 38 treated patients
increased with dose levels, but there were only 3 DLTs (1
each at the 3 higher dose levels, all grade 4 thrombocytopenia that lasted 1-2 weeks), and all cytopenias recovered
from grade 3/4 nadirs to grade 1 within a median of 1.9
weeks (maximum, 5.4 weeks) for platelets and 1.4 weeks
(maximum, 4.1 weeks) for neutrophils. In the second
cycle, 3 of 4 patients who were retreated at dose levels
9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks had grade 3/4 cytopenias, but only 1 patient at the 9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3
weeks dose level had a DLT (grade 4 thrombocytopenia
for 10 days that was still grade 3 at 12 weeks). However,
all 9 patients who were retreated at dose levels 12.0
mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks had grade 3/4 cytopenias in
the second cycle, often requiring transfusions, including 6
patients with DLTs (5 patients had thrombocytopenia
that lasted >7 days, including 4 who still had grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia at 12 weeks). Finally, 2 patients at 6.5
mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks encountered grade 3/4 cytopenias after receiving 3 or 4 cycles, including 1 DLT
because of prolonged grade 4 thrombocytopenia. After
completing this study, 20 patients received chemotherapy,
predominantly gemcitabine alone or in combination with
1 or more other drugs (capecitabine, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and erlotinib), indicating that the myelosuppression from RAIT was reversible and did not
affect patients’ ability to receive other forms of therapy after participating in this study.

Radiation Dosimetry Estimates

Normal organ radiation doses for the first and second
cycles in the same patients were not substantially different
and were similar to those reported in the previous study.17
For example, a single cycle of treatment at the 12.0 mCi/
m2 weekly for 3 weeks dose level resulted in cumulative
radiation doses of 878 cGy (range, 417-1577 cGy) to the
kidneys, 1272 cGy (range, 758-1948 cGy) to the liver,
701 cGy (range, 524-997 cGy) to the lungs, and 233 cGy
(range, 154-312 cGy) to the red bone marrow. Even with
repeated cycles, the total cumulative dose still generally
remained below the standard limits for the solid organs,
but the combined cumulative dose to the red marrow was
510 cGy (range, 399-638 cGy). An example of antibody
targeting is provided in Figure 2 along with radiation dose
estimates calculated for the primary tumor (range, 39-44
grays).
Immunogenicity

Of the 32 treated patients who had adequate samples for
HAHA assessment, only 1 patient developed an elevated
titer of uncertain clinical significance (750 ng/mL 8 weeks
after the initial treatment cycle, decreasing over time).
Of the 38 patients who received treatment, CT-based
evaluations revealed PRs according to RECIST and stabilization for all dose levels (Table 3). One patient had SD

occurred after the first cycle. The overall disease control

patients (42%) with stabilization as their best response.
All 5 patients with stage III disease had SD, whereas 52%
of patients with stage IV disease had disease control (PR,
6 of 17 patients; SD, 11 of 17 patients). The median duration of disease control was 3.9 months (95% confidence

patients with PRs.
Twenty-seven treated patients had elevated serum CA19-9 levels at baseline and had at least 1
CA19-9 result after the first cycle before initiating
5502

additional cycles. The overall response rate was 33%,
based on decreases >50% from baseline levels after the
first cycle at all dose levels. Twenty-six percent of
patients had a response based on a more stringent
decrease of >75%.
Twenty-five treated patients had positive baseline
FDG-PET studies with at least 1 PET study available after
the first cycle before receiving additional treatment cycles.
Standard uptake values (SUVs) were obtained for all index
lesions. Responses were based on decreases of >25% from
baseline for all index lesions or >50% for just the baseline
lesion with maximal SUV value. PET-SUV decreases
occurred at all dose levels, with overall response rates of
52% (all index lesions) and 36% (maximal baseline lesion
only). Examples of PET responses to treatment are provided in Figure 2.

DISCUSSION
Therapy with radiolabeled antibodies has achieved success
in lymphomas, but objective responses rarely are reported in
solid tumors with single-dose RAIT.23 Only limited efforts
involving dose fractionation or administration with other
systemic and potentially radiation-enhancing drugs have
been undertaken.24-26 To our knowledge, this is the first
study describing the combination of a drug and RAIT as
active in a solid tumor and particularly in a challenging disease like advanced PDC. In the first study of pretreated
patients with PDC who received a single dose of 90YhPAM4, several patients had transient responses by CT,17
suggesting that the radiolabeled antibody was active by itself.
This is encouraging, because objective responses rarely occur
with standard doses of gemcitabine and erlotinib.2 The
hypotheses for this study were: 1) RAIT fractionation would
be more potent with less myelosuppression, 2) combination
with a low gemcitabine dose of 200 mg/m2 weekly for 4
weeks would further potentiate therapeutic benefit without
substantially increasing toxicity, and 3) repeated cycles
would be more effective than a single cycle. These hypotheses were confirmed. The imaging, pharmacokinetic, and
radiation dosimetry data obtained at the first cycle in this
study were similar to those reported with single-dose RAIT
without gemcitabine in the previous study,17 and there were
no changes in these parameters with repeated cycles. The
90
Y-hPAM4 administrations were well tolerated with no
infusion reactions. After completing this investigational
treatment, 20 of 38 patients were able to receive various regimens of chemotherapy at different times during the course
of their later therapy despite the dose-related myelosuppression induced with RAIT. Thus, combined RAIT plus chemotherapy may not limit subsequent chemotherapy.
With a median OS for all patients of 7.7 months,
this regimen of a single treatment cycle provides evidence
of modest antitumor activity for this combination therapy,
especially because 5 patients with stage III disease contributed a median OS of 19.6 months. For those who
received at least 2 treatment cycles, a median survival of
11.8 months was achieved; and, at 1 year, 46% remained
alive (or 26% of all 38 patients who were treated at any
dose). When considering only the 10 patients with stage
IV disease, an median OS of 10.7 months was achieved.

Repeated cycles will be required in future studies, but only
approximately 33% of patients in the current study
received additional cycles at the option of the managing
physician. Nevertheless, these initial results appear promising, even compared with recent reports from other trials,
because FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) required a median of 10 cycles to
achieve a median survival of 11.1 months, and 48.4% of
patients remained alive at 1 year4: whereas the combination of gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound
paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) required a median of 6 cycles to
achieve a median survival of 10.3 months, and similarly,
48% of patients remained alive at 1 year.5 However, both
of these therapy regimens had more severe adverse events,
including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia4 and more
fatigue and sensory neuropathy,5 than the reversible myelosuppression noted as the only major side effect in the
current study. In this trial, most patients who received
repeated cycles had a total of 8 very low doses of gemcitabine and 6 fractionated doses of RAIT; thus, the therapy
was shorter in duration and less intensive than the other
combination chemotherapy regimens. We appreciate that
it is premature to compare our 1-arm, initial therapy trial
with the other cited studies and that, as in most survival
trials of investigational agents, further therapies administered also may contribute to improved patient outcome.
Furthermore, the small number of patients who received
repeated therapy cycles in this study could constitute a
selection bias of patients with less aggressive disease.
Of the 38 treated patients, the overall disease control
rate (CR þ PR þ SD) according to CT-based RECIST
criteria was 58%, including 6 patients (16%) with PRs
(all with stage IV disease) and 16 patients (42%) with SD
as their best response, and approximately 66% received
only a single therapy cycle. Metabolic imaging (PET) and
biomarkers (CA19-9) confirmed efficacy; after the first
cycle, 52% of patients (13 of 25) had negative or >25%
reduced uptake in all lesions by FDG-PET SUV values,
and 33% of patients (9 of 27) who had elevated CA19-9
levels at baseline had decreases >50% in serum levels.
Comparing results after the first cycle between patients
treated at the 2 highest dose levels (12.0 mCi/m2 weekly
for 3 weeks) and patients treated at the 2 lowest dose levels
(9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks), 18% versus 6%,
respectively, had CT-confirmed PRs; 44% versus 18%,
respectively, had CA19-9 decreases; and 63% versus 33%,
respectively, had PET-confirmed improvements. Hence,
these parameters responded in a dose-dependent, concordant manner and are consistent with the experience reported
with nab-paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine.5

In the current study, patients received the same 90Y
dose for each of their first or repeat cycles. And, as
expected, the major toxicity was grade 3/4 neutropenia or
thrombocytopenia, which increased with both dose level
and retreatment. Although these findings generally are
consistent with increasing radiation-absorbed doses to the
red bone marrow, the current dosimetry methodology for
predicting myelosuppression remains too limited to be
applied on an individual basis other than to avoid exceeding generally accepted limits, which often are required for
nonmyeloablative therapy studies. Here, this meant that
the highest planned dose level of 15 mCi/m2 weekly for 3
weeks was not pursued further after several patients had
their dose reduced to remain within these limits. Then,
patients initially were entered into the second part of the
study at the maximally tolerated 90Y dose level of 12 mCi/
m2 weekly for 3 weeks. This dose continued to be acceptable for the first cycle, because all cytopenias with followup were readily reversible with infrequently required hematologic support. However, the 12 mCi/m2 dose
appeared to be too high for retreatment, because several
patients developed prolonged and transfusion-dependent
thrombocytopenia after a second cycle. Therefore, subsequent patients were enrolled at 9.0 mCi/m2. Although 1
patient at 9.0 mCi/m2 developed thrombocytopenia that
continued at grade 3 for at least 12 weeks, all other occurrences of cytopenias with retreatment at dose levels 9
mCi/m2 were reversible.
Thus, based on the results from this phase 1 study,
the maximum 90Y dose selected for further clinical development in this population is 12.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3
weeks during the first cycle. However, because patients
received the same dose for a second cycle in this study, the
question of whether 9.0 mCi/m2 weekly for 3 weeks or a
lower dose would be suitable for follow-up as a retreatment cycle after 12 mCi/m2 remains to be determined.
Also, fractionated RAIT was administered only in combination with 4 weekly administrations of 200 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Thus, studies are ongoing to determine
acceptable 90Y dosing for retreatment and whether higher
gemcitabine doses are advantageous with RAIT.
In conclusion, this study confirmed the hypotheses
that patients can tolerate higher cumulative radiation with
fractionated dosing than with single doses and that lowdose gemcitabine can be combined effectively with
repeated cycles of RAIT. Encouraging therapeutic activity
and survival results were observed with this combination
and will need to be confirmed in subsequent studies,
including controlled trials. Finally, in a patient population often characterized by dismal outcome and poor
Cancer

quality of life, this novel therapeutic approach was well
tolerated, and it is noteworthy that it did not preclude
patients from receiving subsequent chemotherapy during
the course of their disease.
