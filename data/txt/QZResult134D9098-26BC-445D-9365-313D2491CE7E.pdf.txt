Abstract
Human T cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) specific to the B cell tumor
antigen CD19 can successfully eradicate systemic human CD19þ tumors in immunocompromised SCID (severe
combined immunodeficient)-Beige mice. However, in the clinical setting, CD4þ CD25hi T regulatory cells (Treg)
present within the tumor microenvironment may be potent suppressors of tumor-targeted effector T cells. In
order to assess the impact of Tregs on CAR-modified T cells in the SCID-Beige xenotransplant model, we
isolated, genetically targeted and expanded natural T regulatory cells (nTreg). In vitro nTregs modified to express
CD19-targeted CARs efficiently inhibited the proliferation of activated human T cells, as well as the capacity of
CD19-targeted 19-28zþ effector T cells to lyse CD19þ Raji tumor cells. Intravenous infusion of CD19-targeted
nTregs into SCID-Beige mice with systemic Raji tumors traffic to sites of tumor and recapitulate a clinically
relevant hostile tumor microenvironment. Antitumor efficacy of subsequently infused 19-28zþ effector T cells
was fully abrogated as assessed by long-term survival of treated mice. Optimal suppression by genetically
targeted nTregs was dependent on nTreg to effector T-cell ratios and in vivo nTreg activation. Prior infusion of
cyclophosphamide in the setting of this nTreg-mediated hostile microenvironment was able to restore the
antitumor activity of subsequently infused 19-28zþ effector T cells through the eradication of tumor-targeted
nTregs. These findings have significant implications for the design of future clinical trials utilizing CAR-based
adoptive T-cell therapies of cancer. Cancer Res; 71(8); 2871–81. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
T cells may be genetically targeted to tumor antigens
through the expression of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)
transduced using retroviral vectors (1). We have previously
demonstrated that human T cells genetically modified to
express a CD19-targeted CAR successfully eradicate established systemic human CD19þ B cell tumor cell lines in
immune suppressed SCID (severe combined immunodeficient)–Beige mice (2). However, despite promising preclinical
in vivo studies (2–5), results from initial clinical trials utilizing
CAR-modified T cells have to date been disappointing (6–8).
A potential etiology of treatment failure in the clinical setting
may be the suppression of targeted T cells by a hostile tumor
microenvironment infiltrated with CD4þ CD25hi regulatory

T cells (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells, as well
as tumor expression of inhibitory ligands (PD-L1) and cytokines
(TGF-b and IL-10; refs. 9–11). This hostile tumor microenvironment is largely unaddressed in pre-clinical models utilizing
immune compromised mice. To address this limitation, we
sought to investigate the impact of Tregs, a potent endogenous
suppressive element of the immune system, on the antitumor
activity of adoptively transferred CAR-modified T cells in a
previously established SCID-Beige mouse tumor model.
Natural Tregs (nTreg) are CD4þ T cells derived from the
thymus and defined by a CD4þ CD25þ CD127 Foxp3þ phenotype. nTregs have been found to facilitate suppression of
autoimmune T-cell responses and maintenance of peripheral
tolerance (12–14), represent approximately 5% to 10% of peripheral CD4þ T cells in both mice and humans (13, 15), and
express high levels of cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen
4 (CTLA-4), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein,
CD39, and CD73 (16–18). Patients with cancer, including B cell
malignancies, have elevated numbers of Tregs in the peripheral
blood and within the tumor microenvironment (19–21).
Furthermore, in a variety of cancers, increased numbers of
Tregs portend a poor prognosis (19, 22). Although the mechanism of suppression by Tregs appears to be multifactorial (23), it
is clear that the presence of Tregs within the tumor microenvironment could markedly hinder the antitumor efficacy of
adoptively transferred tumor-targeted effector T cells (24).

Many studies have been published implicating Tregs as the
cause of failed antitumor immune responses using clinical
correlates, Treg depleting strategies (22, 25), and systemic
lymphodepletion (26, 27). Recently, investigators have developed protocols to readily isolate (28), stimulate, and expand
enriched Treg populations for pre-clinical experimental purposes (29, 30).
In this report, we investigate the in vivo impact of nTregs on
CD19-targeted CARþ T-cell therapy in a previously established
xenotransplant SCID-Beige tumor model of Burkitt lymphoma
(2, 3) by recapitulating a clinically relevant tumor microenvironment hostile to effector T-cell function through the infusion
of CD19-targeted nTregs. Systemic injection of targeted
nTregs into SCID-Beige mice bearing established systemic
Raji tumors prior to infusion of CD19-targeted CARþ effector
T cells wholly abolished effector T-cell antitumor benefit while
prior treatment with cyclophosphamide effectively reversed in
vivo nTreg-mediated suppression of CD19-targeted CARþ
effector T cells. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that tumor specific nTregs may significantly compromise
the antitumor efficacy of CAR-modified tumor-targeted effector T cells in the clinical setting and may, in part, explain the
modest clinical outcomes reported in previously published
clinical trials utilizing adoptively transferred CAR-modified T
cells (6–8).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and T cells
The Raji tumor cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS
(fetal calf serum), nonessential amino acids, HEPES buffer,
pyruvate, and BME (Beta-mercaptoethanol; Life Techonologies). T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS supplemented
with 20IU IL-2/mL (R&D Systems). PG-13 and gpg29 retroviral
producer cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FCS, and NIH-3T3 artificial antigenpresenting cells (AAPC), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor calf serum. All media were
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Isolation of CD4þ CD25 effector T cells and CD4þ
CD25þ nTregs
Peripheral blood from healthy donors, obtained under
institutional review board–approved protocol 95-054, was
fractionated in BD Vacutainer CPT tubes (BD Medical), to
isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CD4þ
CD25 responder T cells and CD4þ CD25þ nTregs were
isolated from PBMCs using the CD4þ CD25þ Regulatory TCell Isolation Kit (Dynal brand; Invitrogen).
Retroviral genetic modification of T cells
Generation of retroviral producer PG-13 cell lines and gene
transfer into effector T cells have been previously described (3,
31). For nTreg retroviral gene transfer, isolated nTregs
were activated with Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander

magnetic beads (Invitrogen), cultured in RPMI media supplemented with IL-2 500IU and Rapamycin 100ng/mL (Sigma) for
48 hours (30, 32), and similarly transduced.
Expansion of CARþ T cells
CARþ effector T cells were expanded ex vivo on NIH-3T3
derived AAPCs as described previously (3). CARþ nTregs were
expanded with either Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander
beads (Invitrogen), or with AAPCs in RPMI medium supplemented with IL-2 and Rapamycin.
In vitro nTreg proliferation and suppression assay
5  105 T effector cells were labeled with 5 mmol/L
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) and cultured simultaneously with titrated numbers of
purified autologous CARþ CD4þ CD25þ Foxp3þ nTregs in 24well tissue culture plates (Costar; ref.33). T-cell cocultures
were stimulated with Dynabeads CD3/CD28 T-Cell Expander
beads (Invitrogen) at a bead-to-responder T-cell ratio of 1:1 in
the absence of exogenous IL-2 and proliferation was assessed
by flow cytometry (FACS) at 72 hours.
Cytokine detection assays
Cytokine levels in tissue culture supernatant as well as
serum were assessed using the multiplex Human Cytokine
Detection System (Millipore Corp.) in conjunction with the
Luminex IS100 system and IS 2.2 software (Luminex Corp.).
In vitro cytotoxicity assay
19-28zþ effector T cells were cocultured with Raji cells in
RPMI media at 1:1 ratio with or without equal numbers of
19z1þ nTregs for 24 hours. Tumor lysis was subsequently
assessed by FACS to detect residual CD19þ tumor cells. The
GranToxiLux (OncoImmunin, Inc.) cytotoxicity assay was
performed per manufacturer's instructions.
In vivo analyses of Treg function
We inoculated 8- to 12-week-old FOX CHASE C.B-17 (SCIDBeige) mice (Taconic) with Raji tumor cells by tail vein
injection or subcutaneously as indicated. In the systemic
tumor model, mice were injected by tail vein (i.v.) with 5 
105 Raji tumor cells on day 1, and on day 5 were treated with a
single i.v. infusion of 1  107 CARþ nTregs, followed by a single
i.v. infusion of 1  107 CARþ effector T cells on day 6. For
cyclophosphamide experiments, mice were injected by tail
vein with 5  105 Raji tumor cells on day 1, on day 5 were
treated with a single i.v. infusion of 1  107 CARþ Tregs,
followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on day 6, and on day 7 injected with an i.v. dose
of 1  107 CARþ effector T cells. Mice were sacrificed when
disease became clinically evident. All in vivo studies were done
in the context of an Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee approved protocol (#00-05-065).
Bioluminescent imaging
For in vivo imaging of Raji tumor cells we utilized Raji tumor
cells modified to express GFP-FFLuc (Clontech Laboratories).
Imaging of nTregs was performed using nTregs modified

with the previously described 19z1 IRES extGLuc bicistronic
retroviral vector (34). Tumor and T cells were imaged using
the Xenogen IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen; ref. 34).
Immunohistochemistry staining
Mouse bone marrow samples were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific). All tissues were processed by routine methods and embedded in paraffin wax.
Five-micrometer sections were stained with H&E (Poly Scientific). Human T cells in the paraffin-embedded mouse tissues
were detected using rabbit polyclonal sera specific to human
CD3 (DakoCytomation).
Flow cytometry
We performed FACS with a FACScan cytometer with FlowJo
software (Tree Star), using PE-labeled CAR-specific monoclonal antibody (12D11, MSKCC monoclonal antibody core facility), FITC-labeled human CD4 specific antibody (S3.5, Caltag),
CD8 specific antibody (3B5, Caltag), CD62L specific antibody
(DREG 56, BD Pharmingen), PE-labeled human CD25 specific
antibody (CD25.3G10, Caltag), and APC-labeled human CD19
specific antibody (SJ25-C, Caltag). Foxp3 expression was
assessed using the Human Regulatory T cell Staining Kit
(eBioscience).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis utilizing the GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Software) was done using log-rank analyses for
survival and the Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test
for line and bar graph comparisons.

Results
nTregs are efficiently modified to express CARs by
retroviral transduction
To assess whether human nTregs can be genetically
manipulated despite their anergic nature and difficulty to
maintain in culture (30, 35), we isolated nTregs using immunomagnetic sorting for the CD4þ CD25hi population from
PBMCs consistently achieving CD4þ T-cell populations that
were more than 95% CD25hi, 70% to 90% Foxp3þ (Fig. 1A and
B), CD62Lhi and CD127 (data not shown). CD3/CD28 bead
activated nTregs were subsequently transduced with CD19targeted CARs using retroviral supernatants, routinely resulting in more than 60% gene transfer (Fig 1C).
We next compared CARþ nTreg expansion in the context of
high dose IL-2 and rapamycin, either by coculture on NIH-3T3
AAPCs [3T3(CD19/CD80); ref. 2] or through the addition of
Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander beads. CARþ nTregs
proliferated equally well under either condition with largely
retained Foxp3 expression (Fig. 1D and E) while only expansion of CARþ nTregs by coculture on 3T3(CD19/CD80) AAPCs
(2) enriched the CARþ nTreg fraction (Fig. 1E and F) resulting
in a significantly increased absolute number of CARþ nTregs
(Fig. 1G). However, due to contamination by persistent 3T3
fibroblasts in AAPC expanded nTreg populations, we utilized
nTregs generated by CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander beads
for further studies.

Expanded genetically modified nTregs inhibit naïve
T-cell proliferation and CARþ effector T-cell
cytotoxicity in vitro
We next cocultured activated CFSE-labeled naïve T cells
with varying numbers of 19z1þ nTregs, and as controls,
nTregs transduced with the irrelevant Pz1 CAR specific to
the prostate specific membrane antigen (31), and control
19z1þ non-Treg CD4þ T cells. 19z1þ and Pz1þ nTregs, but
not 19z1þ non-Treg control T cells, induced a potent inhibition of nonspecific T-cell expansion even at low nTreg to
effector T-cell ratios (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our CFSE
studies, IL-2 levels in nTreg cocultures decreased in a dose
dependent manner (Fig. 2B), a finding similar to results
published elsewhere (35, 36). Coculture of CFSE-labeled 1928zþ T cells with titrated numbers of 19z1þ nTregs or control
19z1þ non-Tregs demonstrated that only 19z1þ nTregs suppressed 19-28zþ effector T-cell expansion (Fig. 2C).
To assess the role of 19z1þ nTregs on effector T-cell
cytotoxicity, 19-28zþ effector T cells were cocultured with
19z1þ nTregs at a 1:1 ratio for 24 hours followed by the
addition of target CD19þ Raji tumor cells at a 1:1 ratio with
effector 19-28zþ T cells. We found that 19z1þ nTregs inhibited
killing of Raji tumor cells by 19-28zþ effector T cells (Fig. 2D).
As expected, 19z1þ nTregs cocultured with CD19þ Raji tumors
alone failed to eradicate Raji tumor cells consistent with the
notion that CD19-targeted nTregs lack cytotoxic potential
(data not shown). Similar to the above findings, nTregs
markedly abrogated the lysis of Raji tumor cells by 19-28zþ
effector T cells in a standard cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 2E).
19z1þ nTregs traffic to CD19þ Raji tumors
In order to assess whether CAR-modified nTregs efficiently
traffic to Raji tumors in SCID-Beige mice, we employed dual
bioluminescent imaging (BLI) enabling simultaneous imaging
of both tumor cells and T cells within the same animal (34).
SCID-Beige mice previously injected subcutaneously with Raji
(GFP-FFLuc) tumor cells underwent BLI to verify detectable
tumor (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, mice were infused i.v. with
either 19z1þ or Pz1þ nTregs further modified to express
extGLuc bioluminescent enzyme (extGLucþ nTregs). BLI at
24 hours following nTreg infusion demonstrated 19z1þ
extGLucþ nTreg but not Pz1þ extGLucþ nTreg signal localized
to the Raji tumor (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemistry studies
confirmed the presence of 19z1þ extGLucþ, but not Pz1þ
extGLucþ nTregs within the Raji tumors (Fig. 3B). Similar
results were obtained in mice bearing systemic Raji tumors,
which primarily infiltrate the bone marrow and lymphnodes,
demonstrating specific localization of 19z1þ extGLucþ nTregs
but not Pz1þ extGLucþ nTregs to these sites at 24 hours
(Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that by 24 hours, 19z1þ
nTregs successfully traffic to CD19þ tumors, recapitulating a
hostile tumor microenvironment which may be seen in the
clinical setting.

systemic CD19þ Raji tumors by 19-28zþ effector T cells
We have previously demonstrated that CD19-targeted
effector T cells successfully eradicate systemic Raji tumors

controls, nTregs express Foxp3. C, FACS analyses for Foxp3 and 19z1 expression of isolated nTregs at day 7 following isolation and 19z1 CAR
retroviral gene transfer. Similar gene transfer was obtained for nTregs transduced with the 19-28z and Pz1 control CARs (data not shown). D, nTreg expanded
following activation with Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander beads (day 0), transduction with the 19z1 CAR, and restimulation (arrow, day 14) with
either Expander beads or 3T3(hCD19/CD80) AAPCs. Cell counts, normalized to total cell number, show similar expansion between the AAPC and CD3/CD28
bead activated groups. E, Foxp3 expression is largely retained following restimulation with either Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander beads or
3T3(hCD19/CD80) AAPCs, with the latter population demonstrating enhanced CAR expression. F, percentage of expanded T cells expressing the
CAR is increased following stimulation on 3T3(hCD19/CD80) AAPCs, but stable following stimulation with Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander

with Dynal CD3/CD28 Human Treg Expander beads.

in SCID-Beige mice as assessed by long-term survival (2, 3). In
SCID-Beige mice, Raji tumors have a primary tropism for the
bone marrow and untreated mice reliably develop hind-limb
paralysis at 3 to 5 weeks as a consequence of spinal cord
compression by tumor expanding from vertebral bodies (2).
To determine whether CD19-targeted nTregs within the
tumor microenvironment could inhibit successful tumor eradication in this model, mice were injected systemically with
Raji tumor cells on day 1, with 19z1þ nTregs on day 5, and with
19-28zþ effector T cells at a nTreg to T effector ratio of 1:1 on
day 6. In all in vivo experiments, more than 80% of infused
CARþ effector T-cell populations retained a central memory
phenotype (CD62Lhi CCR7þ) and consisted of 50% to 65%
CD8þ and 35% to 50% CD4þ T cells as assessed by FACS prior

to infusion (data not shown). Prior infusion of 19z1þ nTregs, in
contrast to Pz1þ nTregs, wholly abolished any antitumor
effect by subsequently infused 19-28zþ effector T cells as
assessed by overall survival (Fig 4A). To confirm the in vivo
presence of Tregs, we further assessed the nTreg to effector
T-cell ratio in the bone marrow of mice infused with 19z1þ
nTregs followed by 19-28zþ effector T cells by FACS analysis at
24 hours following effector T-cell infusion, demonstrating a 1:1
nTreg to effector T-cell ratio (Fig. 6B).
To assess in vivo potency of nTreg effector suppression, we
titrated the 19z1þ nTreg to effector 19-28zþ T-cell ratio in Raji
tumor bearing SCID-Beige mice. We observed that the 19z1þ
nTregs were able to fully suppress the in vivo antitumor
efficacy of effector 19-28zþ T cells, as assessed by survival,

Figure 2. CARþ nTregs inhibit expansion of activated naïve T cells and cytotoxicity of 19-28zþ effector T cells. A, CSFE-labeled naïve T cells cocultured
with 19z1þ nTregs, Pz1þ nTregs, or 19z1þ Foxp3 CD4þ CD25 T cells at titrated effector to suppressor ratios were activated with CD3/CD28 Human
T-cell Expander beads. CFSEþ T cells were analyzed via flow cytometry on day 3 postactivation. Percent proliferation was calculated using FlowJo software.
19z1þ and Pz1þ nTregs, in contrast to control non-Tregs, efficiently suppressed proliferation of naïve T cells. B, 19z1þ nTregs inhibit secretion of IL-2
by activated naïve T cells in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by Luminex-based analyses of tissue culture supernatants at 24 hours postcoculture. C,
CFSE-labeled 19-28zþ effector T cells cocultured with 19z1þ nTregs (solid bars) or Foxp3 CD4þ CD25 T cells at varying effector to suppressor ratios
were activated on 3T3(hCD19/CD80) AAPCs for 3 days. 19z1þ nTregs, but not control non-Tregs, suppressed proliferation of 19-28zþ effector T cells. D,
19z1þ nTregs inhibit 19-28zþ effector T-cell cytotoxicity. CD19þ Raji tumor cells were cocultured at a 1:1:1 ratio with 19-28zþ effector T cells and 19z1þ
nTregs. At 24 hours, persistence of Raji tumor cells was assessed by FACS with corresponding FSC (forward scatter)/SSC (side scatter) plots provided.
Persistence of Raji tumor cells is evident when 19-28zþ effector T cells were cocultured with 19z1þ nTregs, in contrast to coculture with 19-28zþ
effector T cells in the absence of nTregs. E, standardized cytotoxicity assay of CD19þ Raji tumor cells cocultured with 19-28zþ effector T cells alone or
19-28zþ effector T cells with 19z1þ nTregs (at a 1:1 ratio) at various effector to target (E:T) ratios. E:T ratios represent the ratio of 19-28zþ effector
T cells to target Raji tumor cells.

at a nTreg to effector T-cell ratio as low as 1:8, but found
recovery of effector T-cell antitumor efficacy at a 1:16 nTreg to
effector T-cell ratio (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained
when this experiment was conducted using 19-28zþ nTregs

Figure 3. CD19-targeted CARþ nTregs traffic to CD19þ Raji tumor cells in vivo. A, dual BLI of Raji tumor and CARþ nTregs show trafficking of 19z1þ
nTregs, but not Pz1þ nTregs, to subcutaneous Raji tumors at 24 hours. SCID-Beige mice were injected subcutaneously with Raji (GFP-FFLuc) cells and
10 days later, with 19z1þ extGLucþ or control Pz1þ extGLucþ nTregs. Tumor cells were imaged using the FFLuc specific luciferin substrate, while T cells
were imaged using the GLuc specific coelenterazine substrate. B, immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-human CD3 antibody confirms the
presence of 19z1þ nTregs, but not Pz1þ nTregs, within Raji tumor microenvironment. C, BLI CARþ nTregs show trafficking of 19z1þ nTregs, but not Pz1þ
nTregs, to systemic Raji tumors at 24 hours, with predicted signal in the bone marrow of the femurs, tibia, and humeri (green arrows) of 19z1þ extGlucþ nTreg

day 5, followed by injection of 19-28zþ effector T cells, at a 1:1
nTreg to effector T-cell ratio, on day 6. As expected, 19z1þ
nTregs conferred full suppression of 19-28zþ effector T cells,
while 19(del)þ Tregs conferred only partial suppression
(Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that optimal suppression
requires both nTreg localization to and activation within the
tumor microenvironment.
To further define the mechanism whereby 19(del)þ
nTregs-mediated partial inhibition of 19-28zþ T-cell effector
function, we next measured serum levels of human IL-2 and
IFNg as well as the inhibitory human cytokines TGF-b and
IL-10 in treated mice. Human TGF-b and IL-10 levels were
consistently low to undetectable in all treated cohorts (data
not shown), while human IL-2 and IFNg levels were significantly and equally decreased in both 19z1 and 19(del)þ
nTreg infused cohorts (Fig. 5F and G). This finding is
consistent with sequestration of IL-2 by nTregs, a
previously described mechanism of nTreg-mediated T-cell
suppression (35, 36), and inhibition of effector T-cell activation as assessed by IFNg levels. These findings were independent of nTreg activation status, and may explain, in
part, the observed partial inhibition mediated by 19(del)þ
nTregs.

Cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion eradicates 19z1þ
nTregs and restores antitumor efficacy of 19-28zþ
effector T cells
Lymphodepleting preconditioning regimens can enhance
the antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred cytotoxic T
cells which may be mediated in part through the eradication
of Tregs in the host (26, 27). In particular, cyclophosphamide
chemotherapy has been shown to effectively eliminate Tregs
(37–39). To this end, we next investigated whether cyclophosphamide therapy (100 mg/kg) following infusion of 19z1þ
nTregs can abrogate effector T-cell suppression by nTregs.
SCID-Beige mice bearing systemic Raji tumors were injected
with 19z1þ nTregs on day 5 following tumor cell infusion. On
day 6, 24 hours prior to treatment with 19-28zþ T cells, mice
were injected i.p. with cyclophosphamide. In contrast to mice
infused with 19z1þ nTregs followed by 19-28zþ effector T cells
with no long-term survival, mice infused sequentially with
19z1þ nTregs, i.p. cyclophosphamide, and 19-28zþ effector T
cells demonstrated a prolonged long-term survival (67%)
which compares favorably to mice treated with 19-28zþ
effector T cells alone (78%; Fig. 6A). Furthermore, these studies
demonstrated Raji tumors to be largely refractory to cyclophosphamide treatment at this dose level as evidenced by the poor

Figure 4. CD19-targeted nTregs within the Raji tumor microenvironment suppress 19-28zþ effector T cell function in vivo. A, SCID-Beige mice were injected
i.v. with Raji tumor cells on day 0, followed by CARþ nTregs on day 5 (filled arrow) and CARþ effector T cells on day 6 (open arrow). 19z1þ nTregs fully
abrogated eradication of systemic Raji tumors by 19-28zþ effector T cells as assessed by survival over time when compared to mice treated with 19-28zþ
effector T cells alone (P < 0.001). Pz1þ nTregs did not demonstrate significant suppression (P ¼ 0.09 when compared to the 19-28zþ effector T cells
alone cohort; P < 0.001 compared to the 19z1þ nTreg plus 19-28zþ effector T cells cohort). Data represent combined results from 2 independent experiments.
B, 19z1þ nTregs inhibited effector 19-28zþ T cells in a dose-dependent manner with infused nTreg to effector T-cell ratios of 1:1, 1:4, and 1:8 resulting
in no long-term surviving mice (all with P < 0.001, compared to 19-28z Teff alone cohort) while a 1:16 nTreg to effector T-cell ratio allowed for a 50% long-term
survival of treated mice (P ¼ 0.02, compared to Pz1þ Teff treated control cohort). Survival of the 1:16 nTreg to effector T-cell–treated cohort was statistically
similar to the 19-28z Teff alone control cohort (P ¼ 0.3). Similar results were obtained in tumor-bearing mice following prior infusion with 19-28zþ nTregs

FACS analyses to assess the 19z1þ nTreg to 19-28zþ effector
T-cell ratios in the bone marrow of cyclophosphamide treated
mice at 24 hours post 19-28zþ effector T-cell infusion demonstrated a 0.14 nTreg to effector T-cell ratio, in contrast to a 0.9
nTreg to effector T-cell ratio seen in nonlymphodepleted mice
(Fig. 6B). These data verify cyclophosphamide depletion of
endogenous nTregs.

Discussion
The generation of tumor-targeted T cells for adoptive
therapy may be insufficient to achieve significant antitumor
responses in the clinical setting. Specifically, the tumor itself
may foster an environment capable of impairing targeted
effector T-cell function. Specifically, Tregs, which are relevant
in both the clinic and in immune-competent animal models of
disease (40, 41), are absent in the xenograft tumor models
previously used to study modified human T cells in vivo.
Herein we report that isolated human nTregs from healthy
donors may be efficiently transduced to express CARs and
subsequently expanded in vitro. While other groups have
examined the effects of induced Tregs (iTreg) toward similar
ends (42), we opted to isolate and expand nTregs due to
concerns regarding the stability of FOXP3 expression in iTregs
(43). The resulting tumor-targeted nTregs successfully traffic
to tumor in SCID-Beige mice recapitulating a hostile tumor
microenvironment seen in the clinical setting. nTreg infil-

trated tumors were markedly resistant to eradication by CARmodified effector T cells even at low (1:8) nTreg to effector
T-cell ratios, while tumor resistance to effector T-cell eradication was no longer apparent at a ratio of 1:16, consistent with a
dose dependent nTreg-mediated suppression. This dose
dependent nature of inhibition, evidence of persistence of
tumor-targeted nTregs within the tumors, and the inability of
nontumor-targeted control Pz1þ nTregs to inhibit 19-28zþ
effector T cells even at a 1:1 ratio, all support the notion that
the suppression of tumor-targeted effector T cells is specifically dependent upon the presence of these nTregs within the
tumor microenvironment.
While our in vitro data suggest that 19z1þ Tregs are capable
of inhibiting both CAR-mediated cytotoxicity and proliferation, which of these factors predominates in vivo in this tumor
model is currently unclear. However, our prior studies suggest
that proliferation or persistence does not play a dominant role
in this tumor model, as multiple infusions of 19-28zþ T cells
are needed to achieve optimal antitumor efficacy in a pre B
cell ALL tumor model (3). These data are consistent with
limited in vivo persistence and proliferation of the CARmodified cells in SCID-Beige mice favoring inhibited effector
T-cell cytotoxicity by colocalized nTregs as the primary
mechanism of suppression observed in our studies.
The mechanism of in vivo nTreg suppression in our model
further appears to be dependent, in part, on the activation
status of nTregs at the tumor site since nTregs modified to
express the 19(del) CAR retained a statistically significant
ability to suppress in vivo effector T-cell function when

tumor-bearing mice with 19(del)þ nTregs partially inhibited antitumor efficacy of 19-28zþ effector T cells as assessed by long-term survival. Survival of mice
previously infused with 19(del)þ nTregs, when compared to mice treated with 19-28zþ effector T cells alone, was significantly lower (P < 0.001) but significantly
improved when compared to mice previously treated with 19z1þ nTregs (P < 0.001). Data represent combined results from 2 independent experiments.

compared to mice treated with 19-28zþ effector T cells alone,
but demonstrated statistically inferior suppression when compared to mice pretreated with 19z1þ nTregs (Fig. 5E). While
both sets of CAR-modified nTregs were previously activated
using CD3/28 beads and IL-2, only the 19z1þ nTregs receive
additional intratumoral activation via a functional CAR. This
phenomenon is consistent with prior literature reporting the
requirement for activation to induce Treg-mediated suppression (36) although activation and suppression can be sepa-

rated temporally (44). The mechanism of this retained but
attenuated suppression may be partially mediated by direct
contact of the nTreg with effector T cells since the 19(del)þ
nTregs successfully traffic to the tumor (35). Additionally, we
found that both 19z1þ and 19(del)þ nTreg infused mice
demonstrated equal levels of IL-2 reduction in serum suggesting that 19(del)þ nTregs may further inhibit effector T-cell
function through a retained ability to sequester of IL-2, a
known mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression (23).

Figure 6. Cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion following 19z1þ nTreg infusion, enhances 19-28zþ effector T-cell tumor cell eradication, altering the nTreg to
effector T-cell ratio within the tumor microenvironment. A, SCID-Beige were mice injected i.v. with Raji tumor cells on day 0, followed by 19z1þ nTregs on
day 5 (left filled arrow), i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) on day 6 (open arrow), and 19-28z or Pz1þ effector T cells on day 7 (right black arrow).
Long-term survival comparable to no-nTreg controls was observed in mice injected with 19z1þ nTregs followed by cyclophosphamide therapy and 19-28zþ
effector T-cell infusion which was significantly superior to similarly treated mice without prior lymphodepletion (P < 0.0001). Data represent combined
results from 2 independent experiments. B, Foxp3þ nTreg to effector cell ratios were assessed in tumor-involved tissues (bone marrow) by FACS at 24 hours
following 19-28zþ effector T-cell infusion. Prior cyclophosphamide therapy significantly altered the nTreg to effector T-cell ratios in favor of the 19-28zþ
effector T cells (0.14 with vs. 0.9 without lymphodepletion, P < 0.005). Data represent the average from 2 independent experiments each with cohorts of 3 mice
per treatment group.

Our data are consistent with the notion that tumor infiltrating Tregs may represent a significant obstacle to the
successful application of this adoptive cell therapy. One
relatively direct method of overcoming this obstacle would
be to eliminate Tregs prior to CAR-modified T-cell infusion.
While several therapeutic options exist for this purpose,
including anti-CD25 antibodies and immunotoxins (45), we
chose cyclophosphamide due to its established ability to
eliminate Tregs in the context of an antitumor response
(46, 47) as well as the applicability of this approach to ongoing
Phase I clinical trials at our center using autologous 19-28z
modified T cells to treat patients with relapsed or refractory B
cell malignances. In our studies, prior lymphodepletion with
cyclophosphamide before adoptive cell therapy of SCID-Beige
mice bearing systemic established Raji tumors infiltrated with
19z1þ nTregs abrogated the suppression of subsequently
infused 19-28zþ effector T cells by significantly lowering the
nTreg to effector T-cell ratios from 0.90 to 0.14 within the
tumor microenvironment (Fig. 6B). These data are furthermore consistent with our observed in vivo dose dependent
nTreg-mediated suppression of effector T cells (Fig. 4B).
In conclusion, these data validate concerns that a hostile
tumor microenvironment may markedly compromise CARmodified effector T-cell antitumor efficacy in the clinical

setting. Further our data support the incorporation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to infusion of CAR-modified
tumor-targeted T cells in the modification of ongoing clinical
trials and the design of future clinical trials. Finally, our data
support the potential of CAR-modified nTregs as a novel
approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
