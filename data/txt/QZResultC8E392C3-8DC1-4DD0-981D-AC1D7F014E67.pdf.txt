course is usually indolent, but occasionally the neoplasm progresses rapidly and
spreads to internal organs, necessitating systemic chemotherapy. Because of the
rarity of CKS, the best treatment has not been determined to date. To the
authors’ knowledge, few data exist regarding the use of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) as first-line and second-line treatment in advanced CKS. The current retrospective study investigated the activity and toxicity of PLD in pretreated

(5%) demonstrated grade 4 neutropenia. Fourteen patients (70%) achieved remission of pain and/or edema after 6 cycles. The median progression-free survival
was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 5–13 months). At a median follow-up of
36 months, 15 patients (75%) remained alive.

CONCLUSIONS. PLD is associated with an improvement in objective response and
pain intensity and is well tolerated as a second-line treatment for CKS. Cancer

K

aposi sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal, angioproliferative disease
that originates from the vascular endothelium and has a variable clinical course. Four clinical forms have been described:
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–related KS, classic KS
(CKS), KS secondary to immunosuppression, and endemic African
KS. The disease most frequently manifests with skin lesions, but
mucous membranes, the lymphatic system, and viscera (in particular, the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract) also can be involved.1

CKS commonly occurs in older men, in whom
the tumors usually develop on the lower legs and
feet. Typical findings are initially solitary or asymptomatic macules or nodules, which have a predilection for distribution along relaxed skin tension lines.
Disease progression is variable; the macules or
tumors can remain unchanged for months to years
or grow rapidly within a few weeks and disseminate.
Rapid growth can lead to localized pain and a yellowish green discoloration of the area around the tumor as a result of hemorrhage. Further progression
of the tumor can lead to central necrosis and ulceration. The tumors may bleed easily. Plaque-like and
nodular KS lesions often become confluent and can
be accompanied by massive edema.2 Several seroepidemiologic studies have linked human herpesvirus-8
(HHV-8) to the pathogenesis of KS, and HHV-8 DNA
sequences have been identified by polymerase chain
reaction in skin lesions from patients with KS, suggesting an infectious cause in the pathogenesis.3
Various chemotherapeutic agents have been
tested as first-line and second-line treatments for
CKS in small studies, with promising results.4–6 However, because of the highly variable clinical course of
the disease, it often is difficult to decide whether,
when, and how to treat these patients, who frequently are elderly. Because of the rarity and distribution of cases, to our knowledge only 1 randomized
trial in patients with CKS has been published to
date.7 Although several studies have been published
regarding AIDS-related KS, and standard first-line
and second-line treatments exist for patients with
AIDS–related KS,8 to our knowledge no such standard therapy has been established for CKS.
Encapsulation of conventional doxorubicin in
pegylated liposomes preferentially distributes the
drug into tumors that have abnormal blood vessels
with high vascular permeability, which helps with extravasation of liposomes. Moreover, a liposomal formulation of anthracyclines provides the theoretical
advantages of a longer plasma half-life and less toxicity in nontarget organs compared with conventional anthracycline chemotherapy.9
Liposomal anthracyclines are the best options
for the majority of patients with disseminated AIDSrelated KS. Two randomized trials demonstrated that
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is more effective than the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin,
and vincristine10 and the combination of bleomycin
and vincristine.11 Different schedules of PLD (ie, every 2 or 3 weeks) were used in these 2 trials.10,11 The
side effects in these studies were usually mild.
Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) block box warning places the risk of PLD-

related cardiotoxicity at 11% at a cumulative anthracycline dose of 450 to 500 mg/m2, KS patients (both
those with CKS and AIDS-related KS) typically do not
receive such a high cumulative dose.
Although PLD has been approved for use in
patients with AIDS-associated KS, to our knowledge
only a few case reports and a retrospective study
exist regarding the use of liposomal doxorubicin in
CKS.12–15 We conducted a retrospective analysis to
evaluate the effect of PLD on tumor response, toxicity, and pain improvement in patients with CKS who
had failed to respond to cytotoxic or interferon-a
(IFN-a) treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first
study of PLD in pretreated patients with CKS. We
chose to administer a dose of 20 mg/m2 every 3
weeks to avoid side effects, as well as in consideration of the finding that patients with CKS are often
elderly.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Only patients with an adequate history and sufficient
data regarding disease, treatment, and outcome were
included in the current retrospective analysis. Eligible patients had histologically proven KS and were
negative for the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). Patients with the following cancer stages
(Mediterranean KS staging)16 were considered eligible
for chemotherapy: stage II (infiltrating) in the variant
slow plus complications (lymphedema, hemorrhage,
pain, functional impairment, or ulcerations) (A) or
rapid (B); stage III (flourishing); and stage IV (generalized). The main eligibility criteria for this study
were PLD administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 every
3 weeks, age <85 years, a World Health Organization
(WHO) performance status of 0 or 1, histologically
confirmed KS, a negative serum HIV test, disease
progression on a previous systemic regimen, or IFNa therapy (Table 1).
Patients were excluded from the study if they
were found to have evidence of visceral involvement;
had received chemotherapy within the past 15 days;
or had uncontrolled chronic disease, severe infection,
or a documented history of previous cancer (except
nonmelanocytic skin cancer).
Treatment
Patients were treated with PLD at a dose of 20 mg/
m2 (Caelyx; Schering-Plough, Milan, Italy), which
was administered every 3 weeks by intravenous
injection over 60 to 90 minutes in 5% dextrose via a
peripheral vein, until disease progression or irreversible toxicity was observed. For the prevention of nau-

sea, patients also received a serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist. Given the age of the patients, the chosen
dosage was 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, to limit side
effects.
An absolute granulocyte count <1.5 3 109/L
and/or a platelet count <100 3 109/L on Day 21 led
to a treatment interruption of 1 week. The PLD dose
was reduced by 20% if hematologic recovery took >1
week. The use of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor was permitted. Similar reductions were applied if
transaminase levels were more than twice the upper
limit of normal.

Assessment
In the case of all patients, a history was taken and a
physical examination was performed within 1 week
before treatment. Other laboratory tests (complete
blood count, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin) were
performed within 2 weeks before treatment. All radiologic studies (electrocardiography, echocardiography with ejection fraction, thorax radiography,
abdominal echography, and/or computed tomography) were performed within 4 weeks before treatment. When gastrointestinal symptoms were noted,
we completed the staging with endoscopy. Pretreatment clinical evaluation included determination of
the number and extension of lesions and the presence of complications.
Primary endpoints were the objective response
rate and toxicity. Secondary endpoints were pain
intensity, time to disease progression, and overall
survival.
Objective response was assessed every 3 cycles
by means of careful clinical observation accompanied by photographic documentation. We used WHO
modified response criteria17 rather than the AIDS
Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) criteria because the latter, although useful in patients with AIDS-related KS,

1149

were not suitable for those with the classic variant.
We distinguished 5 levels of response: complete
response, major response, minor response, stable
disease, and disease progression. All were based on
the number of lesions–complete response: 100% resolution of lesions; major response: >50% to <100%
decrease; minor response: >25% to <50%; stable disease: <25% decrease to <25% increase; and disease
progression: >25% increase in the number of lesions,
or worsening of tumor-associated pain/edema. Toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (version
3.0).18
We also evaluated reductions in associated complications (ie, edema, pain, ulcerations, hemorrhage,
functional impairment, and lymphorrhea), an important result of chemotherapy. Bone pain was evaluated with a visual scale using a 3-point scale (0
indicates no pain, 1 indicates mild pain, and 2 indicates severe pain), which was a simplified version of
the McGill Pain Questionnaire.19 Analgesic consumption was recorded by the investigator on the basis of
the type of pain medication administered (0 indicates none, 1 indicates minor analgesics, 2 indicates
mild narcotic, and 3 indicates strong narcotic)
according to the WHO ladder.
Pain and lymphedema were evaluated after every
cycle (3 weeks). Pain and lymphedema remission
was characterized by a pain scale score of 0 (no
pain) and an analgesic consumption scale score of 0
(no analgesic consumption), along with an objective
absence of edema. Pain deterioration was defined as
an increase in pain by >50% of the pretreatment
level, coupled with increased or stable analgesic consumption and an objective increase in edema around
the lesions.

Statistical Analysis
The current study was primarily a retrospective trial
to evaluate activity and safety; therefore, no formal
estimation of the sample size was performed. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, and ranges) and
frequency tables were used to analyze baseline clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes.

RESULTS
Between April 2000 and July 2006, 4 Italian institutions recorded a total of 35 patients with CKS who
were treated with PLD as second-line therapy. Of
these patients, 20 were evaluable for response and
toxicity in our analysis. Reasons for exclusion were

other chemotherapeutic agents (6 patients), PLD at a

Four patients received 12 cycles.

Objective Response
Complete and major responses were observed in 2
patients (10%) and 14 patients (70%), respectively,
whereas stable disease and disease progression
occurred in 2 patients each (10%) (Table 3). The 2
complete responses were observed in patients with
stage IIB disease (1 patient) and stage IIIB disease (1
patient). The major responses were found in patients
with stage IIB disease (7 responses), stage IIIB disease (5 responses) and stage IV disease (2 responses).
Among the 16 responders, 3 had received prior vinblastine, 10 had received prior IFN-a, 1 had received
prior vinorelbine, 1 had received prior bleomycin,
and 1 had received prior paclitaxel.
Toxicity
All 20 patients were assessable for treatment safety.
In general, treatment was well tolerated. No toxic
deaths occurred. The most significant grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia in 4 patients (20%), nausea/vomiting in 2 patients (10%), oral mucositis in 1
patient (5%), and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient
(5%) (Table 4). Grade 3 thrombocytopenia resolved
spontaneously, whereas grade 3 neutropenia, oral
mucositis, and nausea/vomiting resolved after appropriate therapies. Grade 4 toxicity was limited to neutropenia in 1 patient (5%).

Pain Response
Remission of pain and lymphedema was reported in
12 patients (60%) and 14 patients (70%) after 3 and 6
cycles, respectively (Table 5). Ulcerations, hemorrhage, and lymphorrhea resolved in 3 patients, 4
patients, and 4 patients, respectively.
Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival
The median progression-free survival was 9 months
(95% confidence interval, 5–13 months). As shown in
Table 3, all responders were alive 24 months after
treatment with PLD. At a median follow-up of 36
months, 15 patients were alive and 5 had died (2 of
disease progression and 3 of other causes). Four
patients received other regimens after progression of
disease (gemcitabine or taxanes).

DISCUSSION
CKS is a rare vascular tumor that mainly affects the
skin and is closely associated with HHV-8.20 To our
knowledge, there are few reports in the literature
describing the use of PLD in the treatment of
CKS.14,15 We conducted a retrospective study in 20
patients with non-HIV-associated KS who had failed
to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy or IFN-a. PLD
at a dose of 20 mg/m2 was administered every 3
weeks until disease progression or the occurrence of
irreversible toxicity. Complete and major responses
were observed in 2 patients (10%) and 14 patients
(70%), respectively. Treatment was well tolerated. The
most significant toxicity was neutropenia. Although
the results of the current study in previously treated
CKS patients are similar to those of studies in previously treated patients with AIDS-related KS in
terms of efficacy and toxicity, it is interesting to note
that our patients (median age, 67 years) were much
older than those in the AIDS trials.10,11

To our knowledge, the current trial represents
the first retrospective study of PLD in previously
treated patients with CKS. To our knowledge, the
only other study of PLD in CKS patients was the retrospective study by Kreuter et al.,15 in which PLD
was compared with IFN-a as first-line therapy for
CKS. In the 12 CKS patients treated with PLD (at a
dose of 20 mg/m2 monthly) by Kreuter et al.,15 a
complete response was achieved in 67% of patients,
and neutropenia was the most common adverse
event (reported in 33% of patients). In that trial, PLD
was found to have a higher response rate than IFNa. In the current study trial, PLD was a second-line
treatment and was administered every 3 weeks,
whereas in the study by Kreuter et al.,15 the drug was
administered as a first-line agent and on a monthly
schedule.
To our knowledge, the current study is also the
largest published trial of any second-line regimen in
patients with CKS. In a study Brambilla et al.,21 12
patients with previously treated CKS were treated
with gemcitabine at a dose of 1.2 g/week for 2 weeks,
followed by a 1-week interval. Ten patients achieved
a partial response (91%) and 1 patient a complete
response (9%). Toxicity was limited (grade 2 leukopenia in 2 patients and a grade 2 increase in transaminase levels in 2 other patients). In a study by Fardet
et al.,22 12 patients with refractory, non-HIV-related
KS were treated with paclitaxel or docetaxel. According to AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria, the
response was partial in 100% of patients. Tolerance
was good except for 3 episodes of grade 3 or 4
asymptomatic neutropenia and 1 episode of moderate myositis.
The findings of the current study need to be confirmed in a prospective study, which, due to the rarity of the disease, will require a longer trial period. It
would be interesting to compare PLD with other
tested regimens, such as gemcitabine or taxanes, in a

1152

CANCER

randomized multicenter trial involving patients with
pretreated CKS. It also would be interesting to evaluate the action of PLD as a first-line therapy, comparing it with active and well-tolerated strategies
such as IFN-a or a combination of vincristine
and bleomycin. Approved for the treatment of AIDSrelated KS, PLD should be considered as a possible
approved therapy for the classic form of KS.
In conclusion, the findings of this retrospective
study demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability of PLD
in the treatment of patients with CKS. This regimen
needs to be further evaluated and possibly compared
with other regimens in future randomized trials.
