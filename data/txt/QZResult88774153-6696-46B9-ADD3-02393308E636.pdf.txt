Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Effective targeted cancer therapeutic development depends upon distinguishing disease-associated
‘driver’ mutations, which have causative roles in malignancy pathogenesis, from ‘passenger’
mutations, which are dispensable for cancer initiation and maintenance. Translational studies of
clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions
and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication
(ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis1. Abundant scientific2 and
clinical evidence1,3, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors4,5,
suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at

three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to
AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and
RET6,7; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was
observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220.
Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target
in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for
future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.
Perhaps the most compelling evidence so far that FLT3-ITD could representa driver
mutation inAML was the identificationof a secondary FLT3 kinase domain mutation that
conferred moderate resistance to the multikinase inhibitor PKC412 in a single FLT3-ITD+
patient who relapsed after an initial bone marrow response8. Although the broad-spectrum
kinase inhibitor sorafenib has anecdotally achieved bone marrow remissions in FLT3-ITD+
AML patients9, whether its mechanism of action is mediated through inhibition of FLT3 or
a distinct kinase is unclear. Indeed, two patients who relapsed after an initial response to
sorafenib had no detectable FLT3 kinase domain mutations at the time of resistance10.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A recent interim analysis of 53 relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD+ AML patients evaluable for
efficacy in a multinational phase II trial of AC220 monotherapy documented a composite
complete remission (<5% bone marrow blasts) rate of 45% (frequently associated with
incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts)7. We sought to use the clinical activity of
AC220 as a tool to define FLT3-ITD as a driver or passenger mutation in human AML.
Using a previously validated in vitro saturation mutagenesis assay11, we identified AC220
resistance-conferring mutations at four residues in the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD (Fig. 1a).
Mutations at three of these amino acid positions conferred high degrees of in vitro AC220
resistance as demonstrated in proliferation (Fig. 1b) and cell-based biochemical assays (Fig.
1c). These residues consist of the ‘gatekeeper’ residue (F691) and two residues within the
activation loop (D835, Y842). For unclear reasons, the E608K substitution did not confer
substantial AC220 resistance and was not further characterized.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next assessed the presence of drug-resistant kinase domain mutations in FLT3-ITD in
eight paired pre-treatment and relapse samples obtained from FLT3-ITD+ AML patients
who initially achieved morphological reduction of bone marrow blasts to ≤5% with AC220
monotherapy, but subsequently relapsed despite continued AC220 treatment. In every case,
subcloning and sequencing12 of individual FLT3-ITD alleles revealed mutations at the time
of relapse (Table 1) that were not detected pre-treatment (Supplementary Table 1).
Mutations were confined to two of the three critical residues identified in our in vitro screen.
The activation loop mutation D835Y was detected in three cases, D835V in two, and the
gatekeeper mutation F691L was identified in three. Additionally, one novel activation loop
mutation, D835F, was identified in a single patient. This mutation confers substantial in
vitro resistance to AC220 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and cross-resistance to sorafenib (data not
shown), and was probably not detected in our saturation mutagenesis screen because its
creation requires a two-nucleotide substitution. One patient (1011-007) seemed to have
evolved polyclonal resistance, with both F691L and D835V mutations detected on separate
FLT3-ITD sequences. Collectively, these findings suggest that clinical response and relapse
in each of these eight patients is mechanistically mediated through modulation of FLT3-ITD
kinase activity.
To assess more precisely for resistance-conferring mutations at relapse, we used a recently
described single molecule real-time (SMRT; Pacific Biosciences) sequencing platform,
which can provide sequencing reads of sufficient length to enable focused interrogation of
FLT3-ITD alleles (Supplementary Fig. 2)13. With this assay, hundreds of reads (range 19–
930) spanning the ITD region and kinase domain with an average read length of greater than

1 kilobase (kb) (Supplementary Table 2) were reliably obtained from individual patient
samples. Attention was focused on the amino acid codons identified in the in vitro screen for
AC220 resistance-conferring mutations. SMRT sequencing confirmed the presence of
resistance-conferring kinase domain mutations in FLT3-ITD at relapse in all eight patient
samples (Table 2). Consistent with the results obtained by subcloning and sequencing,
mutations at E608 and Y842 were not detected. The frequency of individual alternative
codon substitutions within FLT3-ITD ranged from as low as 2.7% (D835F in patient
1005-006) to 50.6% (D835Y in patient 1005-009). The presence of polyclonal resistance
was confirmed in patient 1011-007, and noted in an additional three cases: 1009-003,
1005-006 and 1005-007 (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). In general, mutations were
detected on distinct molecules, although in the case of 1011-007, a subset of FLT3-ITD
molecules with F691L also harboured a D835V mutation (5/21 observations; 23.8% of
FLT3-ITD(F691L) alleles; data not shown). Analysis of three normal control samples
revealed base substitutions at these residues at a very low frequency (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 3). The evolution of polyclonal resistance due to secondary kinase
domain mutations in FLT3-ITD in four of eight relapsed patients is supportive of a central
dependence upon FLT3-ITD signalling in the leukaemic clone of a subset of AML patients,
and indicative of profound selective pressure exerted upon this clone by AC220.
Additionally, these findings reveal the genetic complexity of drug-resistant disease that may
evolve in cancer patients on clinically active therapy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All mutations identified at relapse were detected at a frequency significantly higher than that
observed in a normal control, and although relapse occurred relatively rapidly in some
patients, mutations were not convincingly detectable before treatment. The aggregate
frequency of all mutations at relapse in individual patients ranged from approximately 20–
50% in all cases, which is consistent with leukaemic blasts homozygous for FLT3-ITD and
containing one drug-resistant allele per cell, although the presence of a heterogeneous blast
population with only a subset of drug-resistant FLT3-ITD+ cells expressing kinase domain
mutations cannot be excluded.
The five substitutions that conferred a high degree of resistance to AC220 in vitro were
cross-resistant to sorafenib in cell-based growth and biochemical assays (Supplementary
Fig. 4). The degree of relative resistance to sorafenib associated with these mutants was
generally similar to that observed with AC220 (Supplementary Table 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To understand the structural effects of AC220-resistance conferring mutations, we modelled
the binding of AC220 to FLT3 (Fig. 2a). The crystal structure of the FLT3 kinase domain
has been determined previously in an inactive conformation14 that resembles the inactive
conformations of ABL15, KIT16 and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase17, with the activation
loop folded back onto the ATP-binding cleft (loop-in conformation), thereby preventing
substrate loading. The Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif at the amino-terminal end of the activation
loop adopts the DFG-out conformation, in which the Asp side chain, which normally
coordinates a magnesium ion, is removed from the active site. The activation of FLT3 would
require flipping of the DFG motif and reorganization of the activation loop, as observed in
ABL18 and insulin receptor kinase19. Previously published binding data suggest that AC220
is a type II kinase inhibitor that preferentially binds to the inactive, DFG-out kinase
conformation20. Our molecular docking analysis supports a model whereby AC220 interacts
favourably with the DFG-out, inactive conformation. In the docked AC220–FLT3 model,
the AC220 amide group is 2.6Å from the carbonyl group of C694, consistent with the
formation of a hydrogen bond. The phenol ring of AC220 forms a perpendicular aromatic–
aromatic interaction21 with F830 in the DFG motif (Fig. 2b). This interaction would not be
possible in the DFG-in, active kinase conformation. The gatekeeper residue F691 forms a
π–π stacking contact with the benzo-imidazol-thiazol moiety of AC220, which may further

stabilize the complex. Substitutions at F691 with non-aromatic residues such as leucine may
not compensate for the π–π stacking interaction.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Residues D835 and Y842 stabilize the inactive conformation of the activation loop by
forming hydrogen bonds with the main-chain amide group of S838 and the side chain of
D811, respectively (Fig. 2c). Thus, replacement of either residue might destabilize this
particular inactive conformation of the activation loop, which would then be expected to
hinder the binding of AC220. In further support of this model, a binding study of AC220
and sorafenib, a crystallographically proven type II inhibitor22, revealed that the binding
affinity of both inhibitors to the FLT3 D835V mutant is substantially reduced compared to
native FLT3, both in the presence and absence of the juxtamembrane domain containing the
ITD (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Other potential explanations for the mechanism of resistance conferred by AC220-resistant
mutants include increased kinase activity and differential activation of downstream
effectors. Western blot analysis of cells expressing AC220-resistant FLT3-ITD-mutant
isoforms revealed increased FLT3 autophosphorylation of D835 mutant iso-forms, but no
discernable difference in phosphorylation of downstream targets, including the direct FLT3ITD target STAT5A/B23, and no difference in cellular proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Overall, these data support a primarily structural mechanism for AC220 resistance mediated
by mutations at F691, D835 and Y842, although further studies are necessary for definitive
confirmation. We speculate that the ability to retain inhibitory activity against activation
loop substitutions at D835 and Y842 will require a type I FLT3 kinase inhibitor capable of
effectively binding to the active, DFG-in conformation of the kinase.
Substitutions at gatekeeper residues such as FLT3-ITD(F691) are well-documented causes
of resistance to kinase inhibitors12,24. Analogues of the FLT3-ITD(D835V) activation loop
mutation have proven problematic for a number of kinase inhibitors: KIT(D816V), an
activating mutation that is commonly detected in systemic mastocytosis, confers a high
degree of resistance to imatinib and other KIT inhibitors25. Our data, although derived from
a small cohort of patients that will need to be validated in larger studies, suggest that
substitutions at F691 and D835 in FLT3-ITD will pose substantial barriers to disease control
in AML patients treated with either AC220 or sorafenib, and therefore represent high-value
targets for novel FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Compelling data suggest that activating FLT3 mutations are acquired relatively late during
leukaemogenesis in a pre-established clone1,3, and alone are insufficient to cause acute
leukaemia in pre-clinical models2. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular
heterogeneity of individual leukaemias can be substantial, and can occur in both branching
and linear fashions early during leukaemogenesis, including at the leukaemia-initiating or
‘leukaemic stem’ cell level26. Collectively, our data are consistent with acquisition of FLT3ITD and drug-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutations in a leukaemia-initiating cell
population, although formal transplantation studies in mice are needed to address this
question definitively. Our findings validate FLT3-ITD as a therapeutic target in human
AML, and suggest that FLT3-ITD is capable of conferring a state of ‘oncogene addiction’,
whereby cellular survival pathways associated with normal or precancerous cells can
become hijacked, leading to a state of reliance upon key signalling molecules that can be
exploited therapeutically. This work supports the exploration of therapeutic strategies
targeting select activating mutations in other signalling molecules that are believed to be
acquired relatively late in disease evolution, such as JAK2 (ref. 27) or RAS3, with agents
capable of achieving clinically meaningful target inhibition. Further studies will be required
to identify mechanisms of drug resistance that may circumvent reliance on activated FLT3
by activation of downstream or parallel pathways, as has been described with other kinase

inhibitors28. To that end, translational studies using detailed molecular analyses of primary
samples obtained from AML patients treated with clinically effective targeted therapeutics
promise to further inform mechanisms of drug resistance, strategies for future drug
development, and models of disease evolution.

METHODS SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MSCVpuroFLT3-ITD plasmid DNA was mutagenized and used to generated AC220resistant Ba/F3 clones as previously described11. The FLT3 kinase domain was sequenced
from PCR-amplified genomic DNA isolated from AC220-resistant clones. Identified drugresistant mutations were re-engineered into MSCVpuroFLT3-ITD using site-directed
mutagenesis and Ba/F3 cell lines were created as detailed in Methods. Cell viability in the
presence and absence of drug was assessed using trypan blue exclusion. FLT3
phosphorylation status was determined by western blot analysis of whole cell lysates
prepared after 90 min of drug exposure from Ba/F3 cells stably expressing FLT3 mutant
isoforms and from transfected 293T cells in the absence of drug. The FLT3 kinase domain
was PCR amplified from cDNA derived from blood or bone marrow samples from patients
enrolled on the exploratory portion of the phase II trial of AC220 in AML
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00989261; identifier NCT00989261) and from
normal control bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. PCR products were
cloned into Escherichia coli and individual clones were sequenced using Sanger sequencing.
Alternatively, SMRTBell libraries13 were prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions
and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences RS instrument. For details of the computational
sequencing analysis, please see Methods. Molecular docking of FLT3-ITD to AC220 was
performed using Autodock 4.2 package. Inhibitor binding constants were measured using an
active-site-dependent competition binding assay as previously descibed20. For further details
of methods, please see Methods.

METHODS
DNA constructs, mutagenesis and resistance screen

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

FLT3-ITD cDNA cloned from the MV4;11 cell line (ITD: residues 591–601) into the HpaI
site of the pMSCVpuro retroviral vector (Clontech) was a gift from Ambit Biosciences and
was used as a template for mutagenesis. We used a modified strategy for random
mutagenesis previously described11. Briefly, 1 μg of MSCV puroFLT3-ITD was used to
transform the DNA-repair-deficient Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Red (Stratagene) and
plated on 20 ampicillin-agar bacterial plates. After incubation for 36 h, colonies were
collected by scraping, and plasmid DNA was purified by using a plasmid MAXI kit
(Qiagen). Subsequently, mutagenized FLT3-ITD plasmid stock and Ecopack packaging
plasmid were cotransfected into 293T cells grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS; Omega Scientific) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer's protocol. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 h, purified using a 0.44 μm
vacuum filter, and used to infect Ba/F3 cells at a 1:100 to 1:300 dilution of viral supernatant
to fresh RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. Alternatively, viral
supernatant was aliquoted and frozen. Thawed supernatant was used to infect Ba/F3 cells at
a 1:50 dilution. Viral supernatant was diluted with the goal of minimizing multiplicity of
infection. For infection, 1–2 × 106 Ba/F3 cells were resuspended in 3 ml of the diluted viral
stock supplemented with recombinant mouse IL-3 (Invitrogen), and 4 μg ml–1 polybrene,
plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture dish and centrifuged at 1,500g in a Beckman
Coulter Allegra 6KR centrifuge with a microplate carrier for 90 min at 34 °C. Centrifuged
cells were subsequently transferred to a 37 °C incubator overnight. Infected Ba/F3 cells
were washed twice with media to remove IL-3 and plated in 3 ml of RPMI medium 1640 at
5 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well dish supplemented with 20% FCS and 1.2% Bacto-agar

with 20 nM AC220 (a gift from Ambit Biosciences). After 10–21 days, visible colonies
were plucked from agar and expanded in the presence of drug (20 nM AC220).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sequencing and alignments
Expanded colonies were harvested 7–14 days after isolation from agar, and whole genomic
DNA was isolated using the QIAamp kit (Qiagen). The FLT3 kinase domain was amplified
by PCR from whole genomic DNA by using TopTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The
primers TK1F (5′- TGCTGTGCATACAATTCCCTTGGC-3′) and TK2R (5′TCTCTGCTGAAAGGTCGCCTGTTT-3′) were used for kinase domain amplification and
subsequent bidirectional sequencing was performed using these primers in addition to TK1R
(5′- AGTCCTCCTCTTCTTCCAGCCTTT-3′) and TK2F (5′GAGAGGCACTCATGTCAGAACTCA-3′). Alignments to the native FLT3-ITD sequence
were performed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation).
Generation of mutants
Mutants isolated in the screen were engineered into pMSCVpuroFLT3-ITD by using the
QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In all cases, individual point mutants were
confirmed by sequence analysis.
Cell viability and proliferation assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stable Ba/F3 lines were generated by using retroviral spinfection with the appropriate
mutated plasmid as outlined above, with the exception of the exclusion of polybrene. At 48
h post-infection, puromycin was added to infected cells at a concentration of 4 mg μl–1.
Cells were selected in the presence of puromycin for 7–10 days and subsequently IL-3 was
washed twice from the cells with media and cells were selected in RPMI medium 1640 plus
10% FCS in the absence of IL-3. Exponentially growing Ba/F3 cells (5 × 104) were plated in
each well of a 24-well dish with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS containing the
appropriate concentration of drug as indicated in triplicate. Cells were allowed to expand for
2 days and were counted by using a Vi-cell XR automated cell viability analyser (Beckman
Coulter). The mean number of viable cells at varying concentrations of drug was normalized
to the median number of viable cells in the no-drug sample for each mutant. Error bars
represent the standard deviation. Numerical IC50 values were generated using nonlinear
best-fit regression analysis using Prism 5 software (GraphPad).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For proliferation assays, on day 0, parental Ba/F3 cells and Ba/F3 cells stably expressing
FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms were plated in triplicate with 1 mL of RPMI 1640 plus 10%
FCS at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in each well of a 24-well dish. Cells were allowed
to expand and were counted by using a Vi-cell XR automated cell viability analyser
(Beckman Coulter) on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. To maintain exponential growth of cells, 0.5
ml of cells from each well were used for counting on each day and 0.25 ml of cells from the
remaining volume were transferred to a new well with 0.75 ml of fresh RPMI plus 10% FCS
(including 2 ng ml–1 of IL-3 for parental Ba/F3 cells). Extrapolated cell counts were
calculated from the measured count on each day using the appropriate dilution factor (1× on
day 2, 4× on day 3, 16× on day 4, and so on). The number of viable cells at each time point
was normalized to the starting number of cells for each cell line on day 0 and the mean
normalized cell count on each day was calculated. Error bars represent the standard
deviation.
Immunoblotting
Exponentially growing Ba/F3 cells stably expressing each mutation along with a native
FLT3-ITD control were plated in RPMI medium 1640 plus 10% FCS supplemented with

kinase inhibitor at the indicated concentration. After a 90-min incubation, the cells were
washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Cell Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysate was clarified by
centrifugation and quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Protein was subjected to
sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-phospho-FLT3, anti-phosphoSTAT5, anti-STAT5, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-S6, anti-S6, anti-GAPDH
(Cell Signaling) and anti-FLT3 S18 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alternatively,
293T cells were plated in 6-cm plates and transfected with MSCVpuroFLT3-ITD plasmid
containing FLT3 mutations of interest using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, collected, lysed and
subjected to western blot analysis as described above.
Competition binding assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inhibitor binding constants were measured by using active site-dependent competition
binding assays essentially as previously described20. In brief, FLT3 protein isoforms were
labelled with a chimaeric double-stranded DNA tag containing the NFkB binding site (50GGGAATTCCC-30) fused to an amplicon for qPCR readout, which was added directly to
the expression extracts. Binding reactions were assembled by combining DNA-tagged
kinase extract, affinity beads loaded with a kinase inhibitor probe molecule, and test
compound in 13 binding buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% BSA, 2 mg ml–1
sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Extracts were used directly in binding assays without any
enzyme purification steps at a ≥10,000-fold overall stock dilution (final DNA-tagged
enzyme concentration <0.1 nM). Assays were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (23
°C), which was sufficient to establish equilibrium. Subsequent washing, elution, and qPCR
readout steps were as described20.
Patients and FLT3 kinase domain sequencing analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Eight cases of acquired resistance to AC220 were analysed. Patients were enrolled on the
exploratory cohort of the phase II clinical trial of AC220 in relapsed or refractory AML at
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), University of Pennsylvania or Johns
Hopkins University. Details of the clinical trials and results are reported elsewhere7. All
patients were FLT3-ITD-positive at enrolment. Samples were collected pre-treatment and at
the time of disease progression. Only patients who had achieved morphological clearance of
bone marrow blasts to ≤5% at best response and subsequently relapsed with an increase in
peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts are included in this analysis. The patients in this
analysis included all the patients meeting the above criteria at the three participating
institutions. All patients gave informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki to
participate both in the clinical trials and for collection of samples. All research involving
human subjects was approved by the relevant Institutional Review Board at each individual
participating institution (UCSF, University of Pennsylvania or Johns Hopkins).
For sequencing, frozen Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells obtained from blood or bone
marrow were lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer's protocol. The FLT3 kinase domain and adjacent juxtamembrane domain
were PCR amplified from cDNA using primers TK1F and TK2R as above. PCR products
were cloned using TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen) and transformed into competent E. coli.
Individual colonies were plucked, expanded in liquid culture overnight and plasmid DNA
for sequencing was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Each colony
was considered representative of a single mRNA. To minimize contamination from PCR
artefact, we sequenced at least 10 and up to 24 FLT3-ITD-containing clones from each

sample and required that mutations be found in >15% of clones. The primers TK1F, TK1R,
TK2F and TK2R were used for bidirectional sequencing as above. Alignments with native
FLT3 sequence were performed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation).
Sample preparation and SMRT sequencing
PCR product containing the FLT3 kinase domain was generated from patient cDNA as
described above using high fidelity DNA polymerase.Weprepared PCR products for Pacific
Biosciences sequencing using standard commercial kits and reagents
(http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/products/consumables/reagents) following the
manufacturer's instructions. PCR products input amounts ranged from 0.3–3 μg, and we
prepared SMRTBell libraries13 on the full PCR products without any fragmentation. We
sequenced all samples on a Pacific Biosciences RS instrument and recorded sequence for 75
min.
Computational analysis of FLT3 mutations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We obtained samples from three healthy individuals with no cancer history (two bone
marrow, one mobilized peripheral blood stem cells), isolated RNA, made cDNA, amplified
the FLT3 kinase domain, and sequenced following a protocol identical to that used on the
AML samples. We used the sequence from Normal Control no. 1 as a control for all process
steps between sample acquisition and sequencing. Data from the remaining two normal
controls were compared to the Normal Control no. 1 and revealed no significant differences
(Supplementary Table 3). We use the circular consensus sequencing (CCS) mode to obtain
high accuracy reads for the ~1.4 kb amplicon with PacBio RS. The CCS mode generates
reads by combining multiple independent single-pass sequencing reads for individual
molecules to correct raw errors and generate a better accuracy consensus (see
Supplementary Fig. 2). We report only the CCS reads where the same molecule is
sequenced at three or more times, that is, raw read length >4.2 kb for the 1.4 kb amplicon.
With the CCS reads, we obtained the sequence of the ~1.4 kb amplicon containing the FLT3
juxtamembrane and kinase domains with up to about 98% to 99% accuracy (see alignment
identity for ITD– samples in Supplementary Table 2). For each CCS read, we used tandem
repeats finder (TRF)29 to identify the ITD sequence. To determine unambiguously whether a
read was ITD– or ITD+ consistently, we used only the CCS reads that included at least the
region from the 50-bp 5′-end upstream to the 50-bp 39-end downstream sequence of the
ITD region in the analysis. This allowed us to determine the number of sequences containing
the ITD more accurately despite a small percentage of insertion and deletion errors in the
CCS reads. Two distinct peaks allowed us to identify ITD– versus ITD+ CCS reads
unambiguously. We found that each sample had only one major ITD as expected, although
in some cases the majority ITD differed at relapse compared to pre-treatment. We then
passed the ITD+ population of the CCS reads to the next stage for codon mutation analysis.
A list of the number of total CCS reads identified is listed in Supplementary Table 2. We
identified ~200–1,300 CCS reads spanning the whole region between the ITD region and the
furthest codon of interest (Y842) for codon analysis per sample.
For codon mutation analysis, we restricted our analysis to the 608, 691, 835 and 842 codons
from reference sequence NM_004119 (Homo sapiens FLT3 mRNA) and then took the
frequency of sequences obtained for each of these codons in the PCR amplicon of healthy
Normal Control no. 1 and compared that to the frequency of sequences in each AML patient
sample. A local quality filter that required exact matching of the codons before and after the
codon of interest was used for filtering out low quality codon calls that might be due to
sequencing errors. We used the observed frequencies from the control sample for calculating
the significance of the observed mutation in the AML patient samples. The P value was
calculated by comparing the numbers of native codons observed and the alternative codon

between the control sample and the AML patient sample with Fisher's exact test on the
contingency table30,31. Owing to the potential statistical bias that could arise if the number
of observed mutations was small in some cases, or if sequencing error
frequenciesdifferedbetween mutantand reference codon sequences, we onlyreport the
mutations using a conservative significance threshold of P < 1 × 10–5. We used a simulation
todetermine the sensitivityofthisanalysistodetecta true mutation ata given codon position.
Sensitivity in this analysis was determined as a function of three parameters: the number of
errors observed in the control sequence, the total number of times that position is sequenced
in the control, and the number of times that position is sequenced in the patient sample. For
the simulation, we conservatively assumed that all alternative codons seen in the control are
actual errors. With this simulation, we estimated that this analysis allows us to detect
variants in the patient sample above 3% with high confidence if we get more than 300
observations of the codon of interest. To refine further our search for mutations underlying
relapse in these patients, we considered only those mutations that were in cis to an ITD, as
defined on being on the same single DNA molecule sequence read. These mutations at both
baseline and relapse are listed in Table 2.
Molecular docking

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Molecular docking was performed using Autodock 4.2 package32. The FLT-ITD structure
(residue 587–947) was prepared from the Protein Data Bank accession 1RJB14. All bound
waters were removed from the protein. The structure was then added for hydrogens, and
partial atomic charges were assigned using AutoDockTools (ADT)32. Residues K644, F830,
F691 and E661 were selected as flexible residues. To define the flexible residues, we first
analysed the crystal structure of imatinib-bound inactive KIT kinase domain. The structure
of FLT3 is quite similar to that of KIT, so this comparison helps us identify potential ligand
interacting residues in FLT3. In the KIT structure, residue L595, K623, E640, L644, T670,
Y672, L799 and F811 are close to the ligand. We thus define the corresponding residues in
the FLT3 kinase domain (Y693, F830, F691, K644, E661, L818, L616, M665, V624) as
flexible. Our docking studies revealed that the conformations of Y693, L818, L616, M665
and V624 in the docking solutions are largely identical to their conformations in the crystal
structure, and so we did not consider these five residues to be flexible in the final
calculations.

The coordinates of AC220 were generated using the Dundee PROGRD2 server33, and its
initial conformation was energy minimized by the GROMACS force field. The Gasteiger
charges were then assigned to the ligand using ADT. Seven torsion bonds were defined as
rotable during the docking procedure. The ligand was put into the kinase ATP-binding
pocket and manually aligned to avoid atom clashes. A three-dimensional grid box
(dimensions: 60 × 30 × 60 unit in number of grid points, grid spacing: 0.375Å) centred at
the ligand defining the search space was then created by AutoGrid4.2 (ref. 32). Two hundred
runs of Larmarckian Genetic Algorithm were performed to optimize the ligand–protein
interactions. The solutions were clustered according to the root mean standard deviation
values, and ranked by the binding free energy. Two general poses are observed. The topranked pose has an average energy of –10.32 kcal mol–1 (the lowest energy for this pose is –
10.93 kcal mol–1). The second-ranked pose, which is flipped by 180° with respect to the topranked position, has 133 solutions (63%) with an average energy of –5.82 kcal mol–1 (the
lowest energy for this pose is –6.98 kcal mol–1). Given the gap in the calculated energy, we
only picked the lowest one for the purely illustrative purposes of this analysis.
