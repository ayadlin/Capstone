Abstract
About 12% of all de novo acute myeloid leukemias are
characterized by the translocation t(8;21), which generates
the oncogenic fusion protein RUNX1/ETO. RUNX1/ETO has a
modular structure and contains several docking sites for
heterologous proteins, including transcriptional corepressors
like N-CoR, SMART, and mSIN3A. RUNX1/ETO is found in high
molecular weight complexes, which are crucial for the block in
myeloid differentiation observed in RUNX1/ETO–transformed
cells. Essential for high molecular weight complex formation
is the nervy homology region 2 (NHR2) within ETO, which
serves as interacting surface for oligomerization as well as
association with members of the ETO protein family. Here, we
show that the expression of a fusion peptide consisting of 128
amino acids (NC128), including the entire NHR2 domain of
ETO, disrupts the stability of the RUNX1/ETO high molecular
weight complexes, restores transcription of RUNX1/ETO target
genes, and reverts the differentiation block induced by
RUNX1/ETO in myeloid cells. In the presence of NC128,
RUNX1/ETO–transformed cells lose their progenitor cell
characteristics, are arrested in cell cycle progression, and
undergo cell death. Our results indicate that selective
interference with the oligomerization domain of ETO could
provide a promising strategy to inhibit the oncogenic
properties of the leukemia-associated fusion protein RUNX1/
ETO. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2280–9]

Introduction
Chromosomal translocations are frequent events during malignant cell transformation, particularly in leukemogenesis. The
translocation t(8;21), one of the most frequent chromosomal
anomaly in leukemia (1), involves the RUNX1 gene (also known as
AML1, CBFa2, or PEBP2aB) on chromosome 21 and the ETO gene
(also known as MTG8 or RUNX1T1) on chromosome 8. The
ubiquitously expressed RUNX1 gene product acts as a transcription
factor and belongs to the key regulators of hematopoietic cell
differentiation toward the myeloid lineage (2). The nuclear protein
ETO has been shown to make multiple contacts with molecules of
the transcriptional repressor machinery, including N-CoR, SMRT,
mSIN3A, and HDAC1-3 (3, 4). Accordingly, the Drosophila homologue of ETO, nervy, was recently shown to act as a repressor of

gene expression during Drosophila sensory organ development by
interacting directly with the transcription factor daughterless (5).
Within the leukemic fusion protein, the first 177 amino acids of
RUNX1, including the DNA binding domain, are fused to the almost
entire ETO sequence (6). Thus, RUNX1/ETO retains the ability
to bind to RUNX1 promoter sequences and represses transcription
of RUNX1 target genes. Among others, RUNX1/ETO directly or
indirectly down-regulates the expression of genes involved in myeloid
differentiation, such as C/EBPa, PU.1, interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and M-CSF receptor,
and several granulocyte-specific proteins, such as myeloperoxidase,
neutrophil elastase (NE), and granzyme B (7). In addition, RUNX1/
ETO inhibits the expression of the p14ARF tumor-suppressor gene (8).
In contrast, plakoglobin and cadherins, both genes of the Wnt
signaling pathway, are found to be up-regulated by RUNX1/ETO and
contribute to the immature phenotype found in mouse bone marrow
cells transformed by RUNX1/ETO (9). These changes in gene expression may allow the cell to accumulate further genetic alterations,
ultimately leading to transformation and the onset of leukemia.
ETO contains four regions of extensive homology with nervy,
all of which are retained in RUNX1/ETO. In particular, the nervy
homology region 2 (NHR2) mediates oligomerization between
RUNX1/ETO proteins and is involved in the interaction of RUNX1/
ETO with the ETO family members MTGR1 and ETO-2. The
resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the NHR2 domain
revealed an a-helical tetramer critical for the activity of RUNX1/
ETO (10). The NHR2 domain plays a crucial role for RUNX1/ETO
high molecular weight complex formation, repression of transcription, and inhibition of myeloid cell differentiation. Apparently, the
proper assembling of the transcriptional repressive machinery is
one essential feature of high molecular weight complexes as
deletion of the oligomerization domain leads to almost complete
loss of transformation potential (10–14).
In this study, we investigated the consequences of interfering
with the NHR2-mediated oligomerization of RUNX1/ETO. We show
that expression of a polypeptide (NC128) targeted to the
oligomerization domain of RUNX1/ETO disrupts high molecular
weight complex formation, restores expression of RUNX1/ETO
target genes, and reverses the block in myeloid differentiation.
Moreover, NC128 acts synergistically with known inhibitors of
histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to revert the RUNX1/ETO–
induced differentiation block. RUNX1/ETO–transformed cells
expressing NC128 lose progenitor cell characteristics, enter cell
cycle arrest, and undergo cell death. Our data propose the NHR2
oligomerization domain of ETO as a promising target structure for
a molecular intervention in RUNX1/ETO–positive leukemias.

NHR2 domain (amino acids 490–578 in RUNX1/ETO). A Flag epitope and a
nuclear localization signal linked via a glycine-serine spacer were included
at the 5¶ end. NC128 and derivatives thereof (N89 and N82), as well as two
control polypeptides [CP; derived from the first 54 amino acids of enhanced
yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) and BCR, comprising the a-helical
dimerization motif of BCR, amino acids 1–72], were expressed from
retroviral or lentiviral vectors coexpressing either eYFP or enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP). A further control plasmid was constructed by
exchanging seven leucine residues within the NHR2 domain, as described in
ref. 10, leading to N89m7. As the N89m7 polypeptide was rapidly degraded
in cells, the fusion construct N89m7/eGFP was used in the experiments. The
composition of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Cells, cell culture, and retroviral and lentiviral transduction. 293T
and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe,
Germany). The cell lines Kasumi-1, SKNO-1, HEL, KG-1, U937, U937-R/E
(Zn2+-inducible RUNX1/ETO–expressing cells kindly provided by M.
Ruthardt, University of Frankfurt, Medical Clinic II, Frankfurt, Germany),
HL60, Jurkat, and HUT78 were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS
(Life Technologies). The medium for Kasumi-1 cells was supplemented with
20% FCS. For SKNO-1 cells, 10 ng/mL GM-CSF was added to the medium.
Human CD34+ stem cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco
medium (IMDM) with 20% FCS and 20 ng/mL Flt-3L, 20 ng/mL GM-CSF,
20 ng/mL SCF, 20 ng/mL TPO, 20 ng/mL IL-6, 10 ng/mL IL-3, 6 units/mL
EPO, 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
Retroviral transduction and long-term cultivation were done as previously
described in detail (15). The retroviral expression plasmid MSCV-RUNX1/
ETO-IRES-eGFP was kindly provided by M. Scherr (Hannover Medical
School, Hannover, Germany). Production and concentration of lentiviral
supernatants were done by standard technologies (16).
Differentiation, immunophenotyping experiments, and methylcellulose assays. Cells were differentiated as described previously (17). Briefly,
U937-R/E and Kasumi-1 cells were treated with vitamin D3 (10 6 mol/L)
and transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h; 5 nmol/L) for 48 h (U937-R/E) or
4 days (Kasumi-1). Myeloid differentiation of Kasumi-1 cells was also
induced by valproic acid (VPA) at a concentration of 0.25 or 0.5 mmol/L for
5 days. For flow cytometry, phycoerythrin- or allophycocyanin-conjugated
antihuman CD34, CD117 (c-kit), CD11b, CD13, or CD14, and mouse
monoclonal IgG1 or mouse phycoerythrin-IgG1 isotype control antibodies
were used (BD PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany). Methylcellulose-based
CFU assays were done as follows: 2,500 wild-type, mock, and NC128transduced Kasumi-1 cells were diluted in IMDM containing 90%
methylcellulose-based formulation (MethoCult, Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 20 ng/mL G-CSF and 20 ng/mL GM-CSF. After
cultivation for 14 days, clusters containing more than 30 cells were scored
as one colony. The S-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA) was used for GM-CSF receptor staining.
Coimmunoprecipitation and localization studies. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, RUNX1/ETO, ETO, and GAL4-ETO constructs (13)
were expressed in 293T cells together with NC128 or derivatives thereof and
control plasmids. Cells were lysed in NP40-containing buffer. For
immunoprecipitation with endogenous proteins, cells were lysed in 1%
Triton-X buffer with sonification. Immunoprecipitations were done with
anti-Flag (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), anti-ETO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or antihemagglutinin (anti-HA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound immune
complexes were washed extensively in ice-cold NP40 or Triton X-100
buffer. Western blots were incubated with anti-ETO (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-SMRT, anti–N-CoR (kindly provided by T. Heinzel,
Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany), anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MTGR1 (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), antimSIN3A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAL4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-eGFP (Sigma), anti-PLCg (BD PharMingen), and anti-Flag (F3165,
Sigma) antibodies. For colocalization studies, transfected HeLa cells were
fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X 100.
For immunohistochemistry, the following antisera were used: goat
polyclonal antiserum to ETO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2-FITC (Sigma), and rabbit anti-goat-Cy3 as secondary

antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA).
Diluted antibodies (1/100) were added to four-well microscope slides
(Lab-Tek2, Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL). First and secondary antibodies
were incubated each for 1 h at 37jC. Following incubation, slides were
washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and counterstained with
Toto-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Pictures were taken within
the inner sections of the cells by sequential scanning using a confocal
microscope Leica DM IRBE (Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, Bensheim,
Germany). Data processing was done by merging the fluorescence channels
using the software LCS (Leica Mikrosysteme).
Reverse transcription-PCR and PCR of genomic DNA. Total RNA was
isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse
transcription was done with random hexamers using MMLV-RT, RNase
H- (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany), as suggested by the manufacturer.
Used primer pairs for PCR are listed in Supplementary Fig. S1. Preparation
of genomic DNA from Kasumi-1 cells was done using a DNeasy tissue kit
(Qiagen). Amplification of h-actin, eYFP, and eGFP was done on 200 ng
genomic DNA using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). Both reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and PCR on genomic
DNA were done on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer, Foster City, CA).
Preparation of whole-cell extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. 293T cells were transfected with RUNX1/ETO alone or together with
NC128 or control plasmids. Preparation of whole-cell extracts, labeling of
the probe, and separation on PAGE was done as described previously (18).
The RUNX1 binding site within the RUNX3 promoter was used as a probe
(5¶-GCCTGGTCCCTCAACCACAGAACCACAAGGCCAGGCCCT-3¶). AntiETO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for supershifting the RUNX1/
ETO complexes.
Proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and measurement of cell
death. Cell viability was assessed in triplicates by trypan blue staining. For
cell cycle analysis, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 15 min
with 2 Amol/L DRAQ5 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) at room
temperature. Nuclear incorporation of DRAQ5 was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS; Becton Dickinson (Heidelberg,
Germany), FACSCalibur]. Multiplets of cells were excluded from analysis
using the doublet discrimination module. Data analysis was done with
Becton Dickinson Cell Quest Pro software. The percentage of cell death was
determined by trypan blue staining, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD)
staining (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), or incubation of cells with
phycoerythrin- or allophycocyanin-conjugated Annexin V (BD PharMingen)
followed by FACS analysis according to standard protocols.

Results
Design of constructs targeting the oligomerization domain
of RUNX1/ETO. Recently, we and others have shown that amino
acids 334 to 430 of ETO (corresponding to amino acids 482–578 of
RUNX1/ETO), including the entire NHR2 domain, are essential for
repressor activity and the ability to form high molecular weight
complexes (13, 14). Based on these observations, we derived a series
of polypeptides (NC128 and its derivatives N89 and N82) aiming to
interfere with the capacity of RUNX1/ETO to form high molecular
weight complexes. The structure and amino acid sequences of the
derived constructs, including CPs, are shown in Fig. 1A and B.
Proper expression of the different polypeptides and fusion proteins
was detected in cell lysates obtained from lentivirally transduced
Kasumi-1 or transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1C). Similar to RUNX1/ETO,
NC128 was localized exclusively to the nucleus of transfected HeLa
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Coexpression of RUNX1/ETO and
NC128 results in colocalization of both proteins in the nucleus of
transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
NC128 interacts with the NHR2 domain of RUNX1/ETO but
fails to bind to nuclear repressor molecules. To investigate if
NC128 interacts with RUNX1/ETO, both proteins were coexpressed

in 293T cells. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody,
samples were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of
RUNX1/ETO. A strong signal corresponding to RUNX1/ETO was
observed in extracts obtained from cells cotransfected with both
constructs (Fig. 2A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of RUNX1/ETO
followed by hybridization with the anti-Flag antibody showed the
presence of the NC128 peptide in the complex. In contrast, neither
RUNX1/ETO nor NC128 signals were detected in cell extracts
immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA control antibody. Also,
RUNX1/ETO was absent from anti-Flag immunoprecipitates derived
from cells coexpressing RUNX1/ETO and CP. To further define the
minimal sequences necessary for interaction with ETO, NC128
deletion constructs were analyzed equally. N89, which lacks the last
39 amino acids of NC128, still showed binding to ETO sequences to a
similar extent as NC128. Further shortening of N89 by seven amino
acids (N82) almost completely abolished binding capacity to ETO
(Fig. 2A). The NHR2 domain of ETO was found to be the minimal
region sufficient for interaction with NC128. GAL4-ETO deletion
constructs lacking the NHR2 domain (GAL4-ETOD1-236DNHR2)
were unable to bind to NC128 (Fig. 2B), whereas the NHR2containing proteins ETO, GAL4-ETO, and GAL4-ETOD1-236 clearly
interacted with NC128. As expected, the dimerization motif of the
control construct BCR as well as the oligomerization-defective
N89m7/eGFP construct failed to bind to ETO. Furthermore, a GAL4NHR2+C construct comprising the same ETO sequences as NC128

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

was also found to interact with NC128, implicating possible selfdimerization of NC128 polypeptides (Fig. 2B). As the NHR2 domain
of ETO is known to recruit and to enhance binding affinity of
corepressor molecules and ETO family members, immunoprecipitation experiments were also done from cell lines expressing
corepressors known to associate with ETO. As shown in Fig. 2C,
NC128 did not interact with the nuclear corepressor molecules
N-CoR, SMRT, HDAC2, mSIN3A, and MTGR1, whereas binding
of NC128 to endogenous ETO and RUNX1/ETO was confirmed in
ETO-expressing HEL and RUNX1/ETO–expressing Kasumi-1 cells.
NC128 destabilizes high molecular weight complexes
formed by RUNX1/ETO and overcomes transcriptional deregulation of RUNX1/ETO target genes. Because NC128 interacts
with the oligomerization interface of RUNX1/ETO, we analyzed the
influence of NC128 on high molecular weight complex formation
by RUNX1/ETO. Cellular extracts from 293T cells cotransfected
with RUNX1/ETO and NC128 expression plasmids were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography and analyzed by Western
blotting as described before (13). RUNX1/ETO forms complexes
of f2 mDa in size (Fig. 3A, top). In mock-transfected or CPexpressing 293T cells, complex formation by RUNX1/ETO was not
affected (middle). In contrast, cell extracts obtained from NC128expressing cells contained RUNX1/ETO complexes of reduced
molecular weight ranging between 2 mDa and 440 kDa (bottom,
fractions 8–14). Next, we addressed the question of whether NC128

was able to release the transcriptional block induced by RUNX1/
ETO. The transcription of the cell cycle regulatory genes p21waf/cip
and p27kip , which are up-regulated in RUNX1/ETO–expressing cells
(19, 20), was down-regulated in cells expressing NC128 (Fig. 3B).
This effect was specific for NC128 because expression of CP did not
alter p21waf/cip or p27kip gene expression. In contrast, expression of
PU.1, a master regulator of myeloid differentiation that is downregulated by RUNX1/ETO (21), was found to be up-regulated in
Kasumi-1 cells expressing NC128. Similar results were found for
M-CSF receptor and NE genes highly expressed in granulocytes and
monocytes. Also, the tumor-suppressor p14ARF gene, which is
specifically suppressed by RUNX1/ETO in acute myeloid leukemia
blasts (8), was up-regulated upon NC128 expression (Fig. 3B).

Next, we analyzed the DNA binding capacity of RUNX1/ETO in
the presence of NC128. Lysates of 293T cells transfected with
RUNX1/ETO alone or in combination with NC128 or CP were
subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In the presence of
NC128, the capacity of RUNX1/ETO to bind to the RUNX3 DNA
response element was not affected (Fig. 3C). In fact, DNA/protein
complexes of similar mobility were observed in extracts obtained
from cells transfected with RUNX1/ETO alone or cotransfected
with NC128. The presence of RUNX1/ETO in the complex was
confirmed by a slower migrating band after incubation of the
complex with an ETO antibody (supershift). Additional RUNX1/
ETO-DNA complexes of faster mobility were apparent when cell
lysates obtained from NC128-transduced cells were used in

Immunoprecipitations (IP ) were done with

Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE

derivatives thereof were coexpressed
in 293T cells together with ETO or
diverse GAL4-ETO constructs.
Immunoprecipitations were done as
described in (A). C, NC128 was either
transfected into 293T cells or transduced
into Kasumi-1 and HEL cells. NC128
complexes were immunoprecipitated with
an anti-Flag antibody. Thereafter,
immunoprecipitated complexes were
analyzed for the presence of MTGR1,
mSIN3A, HDAC2, N-CoR, and SMRT, all
of which are endogenously expressed in
293T cells. Similarly, interaction with
endogenous ETO and RUNX1/ETO was
analyzed from cellular lysates of Kasumi-1
and HEL cells.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8). Most
probably, this reflects binding of RUNX1/ETO complexes of lower
molecular weight to the target oligonucleotide. From these
observations, we conclude that NC128 interferes with the
transcriptional regulatory properties of RUNX1/ETO by disrupting
high molecular weight complex formation but does not affect the
DNA binding properties of the oncoprotein.
NC128 enforces loss of progenitor cell characteristics and
restores differentiation response in leukemic cells. Kasumi-1
cells share some common properties with hematopoietic progenitor cells, including high expression levels of CD34 and c-kit and the
ability to form colonies in methylcellulose (22). CD34 and c-kit
expression levels were analyzed in Kasumi-1 cells transduced with
lentiviral vectors expressing eGFP and either NC128 or CP (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although high levels of CD34 expression
were observed in nontransduced or CP-transduced Kasumi-1 cells,
cells expressing the NC128 peptide showed a 10-fold reduction in
CD34 expression levels 10 days after transduction. This effect was
not due to toxic effects arising from the transduction process
because nontransduced cells continued to express the CD34
antigen and expanded in culture (Fig. 4A; NC128 day 10, top left
quadrant). Similarly, c-kit expression levels decreased from 90% to
f40% solely in NC128-transduced cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Furthermore, the clonogenic capability of Kasumi-1 cells was
impaired in cells expressing NC128. Whereas 78% of the colonies
obtained from mock-transduced cells did express eGFP, NC128transduced cells did not generate eGFP-positive colonies in semisolid medium (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Furthermore, Kasumi-1
cells expressing NC128 showed elevated expression levels of
the early monocytic lineage marker CD116/GM-CSF receptor
(Fig. 4A). Within the eGFP-positive population, an 18-fold increase
in CD116 expression was observed 1 week after transduction,
suggesting that NC128 allows partial differentiation of Kasumi-1
cells. In contrast, no alterations in GM-CSF receptor expression
levels were observed in mock- or CP-transduced Kasumi-1 cells.
A central characteristic of RUNX1/ETO–positive leukemia cells is
the disability to proceed to terminal differentiation, which results
in the accumulation of blasts and absence of mature granulocytes.
Therefore, we asked if expression of NC128 could influence
differentiation in RUNX1/ETO–transformed cells. For this, hematopoietic cell lines were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing either NC128 and eGFP or eGFP alone. Although the treatment
of wild-type or mock-transduced Kasumi-1 cells with vitamin D3
and TGF-h resulted in an 8- to 10-fold increase in the numbers of
mature cells, as estimated by the expression of the myeloid
differentiation marker CD11b and CD14, a 20-fold increase in the
number of CD11b- and CD14-positive cells was observed in NC128expressing cells (Fig. 4B). No increase in the number of mature cells
was observed in the absence of cytokine stimulation, suggesting
that expression of NC128 primes cells to cytokine-induced myeloid
differentiation.
To verify that the effect of NC128 was specific for RUNX1/ETO,
we tested the effect of NC128 in the cell line U937-R/E. In this cell
line, expression of RUNX1/ETO is under the control of the Zn2+inducible methallothionein promoter. In the absence of Zn2+,
mock-transduced U937-R/E cells differentiate like wild-type cells
with 90% and 80% of the cells expressing CD11b and CD14 after
2 days treatment with VitD3 and TGF-h, respectively (Fig. 4C). No
effect of NC128 on the differentiation properties of U937-R/E cells
was observed in the absence of Zn2+. The transcriptional activation
of RUNX1/ETO by Zn2+ results in a block in cytokine-induced

A, cellular extracts from 293T cells cotransfected with RUNX1/ETO and

chromatography. Individual fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using
anti-ETO antibody. The fraction number and the molecular mass of standard
protein markers and their peak elution fraction are shown (top ). B, Kasumi-1
cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing NC128 or CP. Total RNA
was obtained 5 d after transduction, and the transcription pattern of the cell
cycle regulatory genes p21waf/cip and p27kip , the tumor-suppressor gene p14ARF ,
and genes important for myeloid differentiation (PU.1, MSCFR , and NE ) were
analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. h-Actin transcripts were used as an
internal control. C, the DNA binding activity of RUNX1/ETO is not disturbed in
the presence of NC128. Cellular extracts obtained from 293T cells transfected
with RUNX1/ETO either alone or in combination with NC128 or BCR were

sequence of the RUNX3 promoter. The amount of plasmid DNA used in the

the myeloid cell surface antigens CD11b and CD14 was measured by FACS 4 d after cytokine stimulation. Values of CD11b and CD14 represent percentage from
eGFP-positive cells. C, NC128 effects are specific for RUNX1/ETO–expressing cells. Wild-type or transduced U937-R/E cells were analyzed for myeloid differentiation
before and after treatment with Zn2+ (120 nmol/L) to induce RUNX1/ETO expression. Coexpression of eGFP and CD11b was detected by FACS 48 h after induction
of differentiation with 1 Amol/L vitamin D3 and 5 nmol/L TGF-h (D3 ). Percentage of wild-type (WT ), mock-, CP-, or NC128-transduced U937-R/E cells expressing

myeloid differentiation, as estimated by the reduction in the
numbers of CD11b- and CD14-positive cells. However, expression of
NC128 in Zn2+-treated U937-R/E cells restored the response to
cytokines and resulted in increased numbers of CD11b- and CD14positive cells. In contrast, expression of CP did not relieve the
differentiation block induced by RUNX1/ETO (Fig. 4C). Hence,
NC128 effectively reverted the RUNX1/ETO–mediated block in
U937-R/E cell differentiation.
NC128 synergizes with the HDAC inhibitor VPA. Because
HDAC inhibitors have been shown to be potent inducers of
differentiation in leukemic cells (23), we asked if NC128 could
synergistically act with HDAC inhibitors in inducing differentiation
of RUNX1/ETO–transformed cells. Kasumi-1 cells expressing either
eGFP (mock) or NC128 and eGFP were treated with different
concentrations of VPA. After 4 days treatment with VPA, 15% to
30% of the Kasumi-1 cells expressed the myeloid differentiation

marker CD13 (Fig. 4D). However, up to 70% of NC128-expressing
cells expressed CD13 after VPA treatment (Fig. 4D). Altogether,
these results show that expression of NC128 in combination with
the HDAC inhibitor VPA is effective in reverting the differentiation
block induced by RUNX1/ETO.
NC128 prevents proliferation and induces cell death in the
myeloid cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1. During the course of
these experiments, we noticed a reduction in the numbers of eGFPpositive Kasumi-1 cells expressing NC128. Thirty days after
transduction, almost no eGFP-positive cells could be detected in
this population, whereas mock-transduced, BCR, and CP-expressing cells continued to proliferate (Fig. 5A). This effect of NC128 was
reproduced when the NC128 deletion mutant N89 was expressed in
Kasumi-1 cells. In contrast, the construct N82, which lacks seven
amino acids COOH-terminal to the recently modeled NHR2
domain (10), induced a significant slower growth retardation in

Kasumi-1 cells compared with NC128 or N89 (Fig. 5A). N82expressing cells could be maintained thrice longer in culture. These
results revealed the NHR2 domain as the minimal functional
domain necessary for the growth-inhibitory effect of NC128 in
RUNX1/ETO–dependent cell lines. Moreover, exchanging all seven
leucine residues of the NHR2 domain within N89 (N89m7/eGFP)
abrogated the growth-inhibitory effect, clearly demonstrating that
the effect of N89 is dependent on binding to the NHR2 domain of
RUNX1/ETO. Stable expression of NC128 in the RUNX1/ETO–
dependent cell line SKNO-1 resulted in a similar net decrease of
eGFP-positive cells. This effect was specific for RUNX1/ETO–
expressing cells, because no influence of NC128 expression on the
growth of U937 cells was observed (Fig. 5A). Similar results were
obtained for NC128-expressing HL-60, Jurkat, HEL, KG-1, and
Hut78 cells (data not shown). To exclude any direct influence of
NC128 on eGFP expression, genomic DNA obtained from
transduced Kasumi-1 cells was analyzed for the presence of eGFP
sequences by PCR. Although a strong PCR signal was observed in
mock-transduced cells, only a weak PCR signal was detectable in
NC128-expressing cells, indicating that these cells were selectively

lost during cultivation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Further proliferation assays revealed that both RUNX1/ETO–dependent cell lines
were growth arrested in the presence of NC128, whereas
proliferation of CP-transduced cells was not affected (Fig. 5B).
These observations were confirmed by cell cycle analysis. NC128expressing Kasumi-1 cells were arrested in the G0-G1 phase of
the cell cycle, whereas mock-transduced or CP-expressing cells
behave like wild-type cells (Fig. 5C). Annexin V staining revealed a
5-fold increase in apoptotic Kasumi-1 cells expressing NC128
compared with wild-type or CP-transduced cells (data not shown).
Moreover, long-term cultivation of NC128-transduced Kasumi-1
cells resulted in accumulation of dead cells. Two weeks after
transduction, staining of Kasumi-1 cells with 7-AAD revealed
increased cell death selectively in NC128-expressing cells, suggesting that NC128 acts exclusively on RUNX1/ETO–transformed cells
(Fig. 5D).

in ex vivo cultures (15). In agreement with this, CD34+ cells
transduced with a MSCV-RUNX1/ETO construct coexpressing
eGFP were enriched for RUNX1/ETO–expressing cells after 6 weeks
in culture, whereas mock-transduced cells stopped proliferating
after 40 days (Fig. 6A). Thereafter, RUNX1/ETO–immortalized
progenitor cells were transduced with a vector expressing only
eYFP or NC128 and eYFP. Expression of either RUNX1/ETO or
NC128 was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). In the NC128transduced population, a clear decrease in the percentage of
CD34+-expressing cells was observed ( from >30% to <11%),
whereas no changes in the percentage of CD34+-expressing cells
was observed in the mock-transduced population (Fig. 6C). At the
same time, we found a 2-fold increase in apoptotic cells in the
NC128-transduced cell population, whereas no alteration was
observed in untransduced or mock-transduced cells (Fig. 6C). Over
time, the number of eYFP-expressing cells decreased to almost
undetectable levels, whereas mock-transduced cells persisted in
culture for up to 6 weeks. The decrease in eYFP-expressing cells
was confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA at week 6 (Fig. 6D).
Altogether, these data show that NC128 is able to revert RUNX1/
ETO–induced immortalization of primary human progenitor cells.

Discussion
Oligomerization of leukemia-associated fusion proteins, such as
PML/RARa, BCR/ABL, and RUNX1/ETO, has been shown to be an
essential feature for the oncogenic potential of these translocation
products (11, 12, 24, 25). As deletion of the oligomerization
interface of RUNX1/ETO or mutations designed to disrupt oligomerization lead to loss of transforming properties (10–12, 14),
we reasoned that targeting the oligomerization domain of ETO by

expressing polypeptides derived from this region in RUNX1/ETO–
transformed cells could lead to abrogation of RUNX1/ETO
function. A similar approach has been used to disrupt oligomerization of the chronic myeloid leukemia–associated fusion protein
BCR/ABL. In analogy to RUNX1/ETO, BCR/ABL forms high
molecular weight complexes important for ABL kinase activity
(25). A peptide derived from the BCR oligomerization region was
shown to sensitize BCR/ABL–positive cells to the kinase inhibitor
STI571 and to block BCR/ABL–driven transformation of fibroblasts
(26). In our studies, NC128 was found to bind specifically to the
NHR2 domain of RUNX1/ETO. N89, which still contains the
complete NHR2 domain, retained binding capacity and antiproliferative effects on RUNX1/ETO cell lines. However, substitution of
seven leucines, critical for NHR2-mediated RUNX1/ETO oligomerization (10), or deletion of COOH-terminal amino acids within the
NHR2 domain (N82) abolished binding to ETO, suggesting that a
proper folded full-length NHR2 a-helix is essential and sufficient
for the observed biochemical and cellular effects of NC128. Binding
did not induce degradation of RUNX1/ETO protein nor interfered
with nuclear localization or DNA binding properties of the
oncoprotein. In addition to its role as oligomerization interface,
the NHR2 domain contributes to the recruitment of nuclear
corepressors like mSIN3A and several members of the nuclear
corepressor protein family (13, 14). Our observations do not
indicate that NC128 binds to MTGR1, mSIN3A, HDAC2, N-CoR, and
SMRT, and are in agreement with similar observations made with
ETO mutants in which the oligomerization domain was disrupted
(10). Binding to the NHR2 domain disrupts RUNX1/ETO oligomerization, impairs high molecular weight complex formation, and
thereby most likely decreases the density of recruited corepressor
proteins on promotor sequences, leading to transcriptional

derepression of RUNX1/ETO target genes and reversion of the
differentiation block.
Among others, we found increased levels of the myeloid
transcription factor PU.1 in Kasumi-1 cell expressing NC128, which
most likely contributed to the observed cellular effects. Indeed,
previous work has shown that overexpression of PU.1 in Kasumi-1
cells leads to proliferation arrest and induces differentiation
toward the monocytic lineage (21). The effects of NC128 on
myeloid differentiation and clonogenic potential of RUNX1/ETO–
transformed cells noticed in our studies are reminiscent of those
observed with small interfering RNA targeted specifically against
RUNX1/ETO mRNA (27, 28). Also, peptides designed to block the
interaction between RUNX1/ETO and N-CoR showed induction of
repressed RUNX1 target genes and promotion of cytokinemediated differentiation (29). In all cases, disruption of RUNX1/
ETO function led to a reversion in the expression pattern of
RUNX1/ETO target genes and to a VitD3/TGF-h–dependent
myelomonocytic differentiation of transformed cells. Typical
features of progenitor cells, such as high expression of the cell
surface markers CD34 and c-kit, were rapidly lost in the presence of
NC128, implying that a functional RUNX1/ETO high molecular
weight complex is essential for the maintenance of the transformed
phenotype. In addition, NC128 triggered cell death in RUNX1/ETO–
expressing cell lines and in RUNX1/ETO–immortalized primary
bone marrow cells but not in control cells, suggesting that the
effects observed for NC128 are specific for RUNX1/ETO–expressing
cells. In analogy to observations made for other oncogenes (30), our
results and those of others suggest that expression of the fusion
protein RUNX1/ETO is permanently required to maintain the
transformed phenotype and implies that targeting RUNX1/ETO
could be sufficient to eliminate the leukemic clone. These results
are remarkable because a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments
have shown that RUNX1/ETO is able to immortalize primary
murine and human bone marrow cells (15, 31, 32), but requires a
second hit for full transformation in mouse models (33, 34).
Deregulated gene expression and activated forms of tyrosine kinase
receptors are frequent events observed in t(8;21)-transformed cells
and are considered secondary events in leukemogenesis (35, 36).
The Kasumi-1 cell line used in our studies contains an active
form of c-kit (N822K; ref. 37), whereas the SKNO-1 cell line
contains an inactive form of p53 (38). Despite these additional
mutations, impairment of RUNX1/ETO function seems to be
sufficient to induce cytokine-dependent differentiation and proliferation arrest of transformed cells. Also, recent studies have
shown that truncated forms of RUNX1/ETO, which lack the
COOH-terminal N-CoR and SMRT binding domains, but still
include the NHR2 sequences, have significant transforming

potential (19, 39). These truncated forms are present in Kasumi-1
and SKNO-1 cells and might contribute to their transformed status.
Thus, the effect of NC128 and derivatives thereof on cell
proliferation and differentiation does not depend on partners of
RUNX1/ETO and strengthens the rationale for interference with the
NHR2 oligomerization domain to prevent RUNX1/ETO function.
The fact that suppression of RUNX1/ETO activity is sufficient to
induce transcription of down-regulated genes and to restore
cytokine-dependent myeloid differentiation suggests that RUNX1/
ETO target genes are not irreversibly epigenetically silenced.
Indeed, studies on the RUNX1/ETO target gene c-FMS have shown
that despite changes in the histone modification pattern and
increased association of HDAC, the RUNX1/ETO complex does not
alter binding of other transcription factors to RUNX1/ETO target
genes (40).
Modifiers of chromatin, in particular HDAC inhibitors, have been
used in vitro to treat leukemic cells, and several compounds are
currently in phase I trials (41). For example, VPA, a potent HDAC
inhibitor, was shown to partially relieve the differentiation block
induced by RUNX1/ETO in hematopoietic progenitor cells (23).
Besides its inhibitory effect on histone deacetylation, VPA also
triggers RUNX1/ETO degradation via the ubiquitin pathway.3 We
found that NC128 augments the effect of VPA in priming cells for
differentiation, suggesting that the combined effect of both
strategies may result in an effective reversion of the transformed
phenotype. Further, a combination treatment might allow a
reduction in the dosage of HDAC inhibitors and thus a reduction
of toxic side effects.
We propose the oligomerization domain of RUNX1/ETO as a
valid target for a molecular intervention in t(8;21) leukemias.
Within the translocation protein, the oligomerization domain plays
a central role for the oncogenic properties of the fusion protein.
As targeted disruption of RUNX1/ETO oligomerization leads to
restoration of differentiation, growth inhibition, and increased cell
death in t(8;21) leukemic cells, screening for small peptides or
small molecular weight compounds, designed to block NHR2mediated oligomerization, could provide promising tools to
improve the therapeutic outcome of acute myeloid leukemias
carrying the t(8;21) translocation.
