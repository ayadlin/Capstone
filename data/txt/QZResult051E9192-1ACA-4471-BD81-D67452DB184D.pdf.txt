ABSTRACT
Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endocannabinoid-like molecule, was revealed to
modulate lipid metabolism through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α
(PPAR-α) mediated mechanism. In present study, we further investigated the activities
and mechanisms of OEA in ameliorating hepatic fibrosis in Sv/129 mice induced by
a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet or thioacetamide (TAA) treatment. Liver
fibrosis development was assessed by Hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius red staining.
Treatment with OEA (5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) significantly
attenuated the progress of liver fibrosis in both two experimental animal models by
blocking the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Gene expression analysis of
hepatic tissues indicated that OEA inhibited the expression of α-smooth muscle action
(α-SMA) and collagen matrix, fibrosis markers, and genes involved in inflammation
and extracellular matrix remodeling. In vitro studies showed that OEA inhibited
transforming growth factor β1-stimulated HSCs activation through suppressing
Smad2/3 phosphorylation, α-SMA expression and myofibroblast transformation.
These improvements could not be observed in PPAR-α knockout mice models with
OEA administration, which suggested all the anti-fibrotic effects of OEA in vivo and
in vitro were mediated by PPAR-α activation. Collectively, our results suggested that
OEA exerted a pharmacological effect on modulating hepatic fibrosis development
through the inhibition of HSCs activation in liver and therefore may be a potential
therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis.

INTRODUCTION

carcinoma (HCC) [1, 2]. This pathological process is
characterized by excessive production and deposition
of proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs) are recognized as the main producers
of matrix components in the liver, and play a critical
role in regulating the production and secretion of the
ECM. In normal livers, HSCs stay in a quiescent state,
mainly serving to store vitamin A. These quiescent HSCs
may trans-differentiate following liver injury however,
changing into highly-proliferative myofibroblast-like

Liver fibrosis is a common wound healing response
that may be mounted in response to chronic or repeated
liver injury. Various etiological factors, including chronic
hepatitis virus infection, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), genetic mutations, and cholestatic diseases
can drive fibrosis. About 25-40% of liver fibrosis cases
lead to cirrhosis. The same pathological processes
behind fibrosis have also been linked with hepatocellular

cells that are characterized by the expression of α-smooth
muscle actin (α-SMA), and excessive production of type I
collagen (Col1a) and type III collagen (Col3a), which are
critical components of the ECM. The trans-differentiation
process of HSCs into myofibroblasts is mainly regulated
by canonical TGF-β1/Smad signaling. Suppression of
HSC activation has been proposed as therapeutic strategy
for the treatment and prevention of liver fibrosis, and novel
methods for achieving this end are still being sought [3-5].
Peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors
(PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor
family of ligand-activated transcription factors, consisting
of three different isoforms; PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ and
PPAR-γ. PPARs play important roles in controlling
many physiological processes, including inflammation
and fibrogenesis. Due to their unique tissue distribution
patterns, the roles of the three PPARs are at least
spatially, if not always functionally, distinct. PPAR-α is
predominantly present in the liver [6]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that PPAR-α plays a critical role in
modulation of energy balance and regulation of hepatic
lipid metabolism [7, 8]. PPAR-α serves as a key signal
transducer in these pathways, acting downstream of
sensors such as AMP kinase and aldose reductase.
A synthetic PPAR-α ligand, fenofibrate, functions to
reduce serum triglyceride levels, and is clinically used to
ameliorate plasma lipid disorders at risk of cardiovascular
disease [9]. Some clinical studies have shown that
fenofibrate also plays a key role in maintaining the normal
liver function and improving insulin resistance in NAFLD
patients [10]. In addition, several observations have
indicated that PPAR-α might also play a pivotal role in the
molecular control of fibrogenesis. Previous manuscripts
have reported that PPAR-α agonists Wy-14643 and
fenofibrate may prevent the development of hepatic
fibrosis in the rat thioacetamide (TAA) and methionine
choline-deficient (MCD) models of liver fibrosis [11, 12].
PPAR-α has also been shown to be significantly involved
with inflammation, as activation of PPAR-α protects
against hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in mice
[13]. Newer studies add to a growing body of evidence
that PPAR-α could be promising a therapeutic target in
physiological and pathological processes involved in liver
diseases [14].
Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a high affinity
endogenous ligand of PPAR-α, has been identified to
play an important role in the treatment of obesity and
arteriosclerosis [15-17]. In contrast to Wy-14643 and
fenofibrate, OEA is not a specific ligand for PPAR-α,
as it can act via other receptors such as the vanilloid
receptor (TRPV1) and GPR119, allowing it to have
diverse physiological functions [18, 19]. The role of
OEA in liver fibrosis has not been well elucidated. In this
study, we investigated the effect of OEA treatment on the
progression of liver fibrosis in chronic MCD diet-induced
and TAA-induced experimental models. We demonstrate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that OEA acts through a PPAR-α dependent mechanism
to ameliorate liver fibrosis, and observe that TGF-β1–
mediated HSC activation is also involved.

RESULTS
OEA reverses MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis,
liver fibrosis, and leukocyte infiltration
In order to evaluate the anti-fibrosis role of OEA
in vivo, we first established a liver fibrosis model using
MCD diet-induced Sv/129 mice. Histological analysis
via H&E, Sirius red, and Oil red O staining staining was
used to gauge the extent of liver injury induced by the
MCD diet. After 8 weeks MCD diet feeding, both PPAR-α
knockout mice and WT mice developed moderate steatosis
and severe hepatocyte ballooning (Figure 1A, S1A, B).
Significant deposition of fibrillary collagens was also
detected in the livers of both mice types (Figure 1B),
along with significantly elevated serum levels of ALT (P
< 0.001, P < 0.001), AST (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) (Figure
2A, 2B), and liver levels of TG (P < 0.001, P < 0.01)
(Figure S1C). In contrast, livers from OEA administration
groups exhibited ameliorated steatosis and reduced
hepatocyte ballooning (Figures 1A, S1A, S1B), along
with the improvements observable via Sirius-red staining
(Figure 1B). Interestingly, chemical analysis of serum
and hepatic composition indicate that OEA treatment
partially prevented the increases of ALT, AST and TG
levels observed in WT mice given MCD diet (P < 0.01,
P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively), but did not attenuate the
increase in PPAR-α knockout groups (Figure 2A, 2B and
Figure S1C).
In order to further confirm that OEA treatment
could bring about sustained amelioration of liver fibrosis,
we next assessed the impact that OEA treatment had on
immune cells. Histological analysis demonstrated that
the MCD diet led to significant increases in the number
of leukocytes in the livers of both WT mice and PPAR-α
knockout mice, but that treatment with OEA reduced this
recruitment in WT mice only. (Figure 1A). OEA treatment
also led to significant reductions in the mRNA expression
of the adhesion molecules ICAM and VCAM, two key
proteins responsible for mediating the recruitment of
immune cells to sites of liver injury in WT MCD-fed mice,
but could not suppress their expression in the absence of
PPAR-α (Figure 2C, 2D). From these results, it seems
clear that OEA can play a potent role in repressing liver
damage via a PPAR- α dependent mechanism.

were all substantially reversed by treatment with OEA

also noteworthy that the mRNA and protein expression

knockout mice, the MCD group exhibited significantly
upregulated levels of TIMP1, MMP2, and MMP9 (Figure
3E-3G). This type of expression pattern is consistent
with the expected compensation pattern mounted by
hepatocytes in response to collagen deposition. Treatment
with OEA significantly suppressed the induction of these
remodeling proteins in WT mice (Figure 3E-3G).

identified by H&E staining and Sirius Red staining (Figure
4A, 4B). These decreases were associated with significant
decreases in ICAM and VCAM mRNA expression (Figure
4C, 4D), a marked decrease in TGF-β and α-SMA mRNA
expression (Figure 4E, 4F), and a significant reduction
in Col1a and Col3a mRNA expression (Figure 4G, 4H)
after OEA administration in TAA-treated WT mice. The
same reduction pattern was also observed in the mRNA
expression levels of TIMP1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 after
OEA treatment in the TAA-treated WT mice (Figure
4I-4K). By contrast, PPAR-α knockout mice were
completely insensitive to OEA treatment. Take together
with our previous results, it seems clear then that OEA can
generally ameliorate liver fibrosis via a PPAR-α-dependent
mechanism.

OEA attenuates TAA-induced liver fibrosis in
mice through PPAR-α
In order to further confirm the ability of OEA
to reverse liver fibrosis, we further tested the effect of
OEA on TAA-induced hepatic fibrogenesis as a second
experimental model. Significant liver fibrosis was
observed in both PPAR-α knockout mice and WT mice
in response to TAA injection. Similar to the results in
MCD diet-induced liver fibrosis model, OEA remarkably
prevented the progression of TAA-induced hepatic
fibrosis in WT mice, but not in PPAR-α knockout mice, as

marker of HSC activation. As shown in Figure 5E, 5F,
the inhibitory effects of OEA on HSCs activation were
completely blocked by PPAR-α antagonist MK886
(10 μM). Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression
levels of PPAR-α were down-regulated with TGF-β1
stimulation, while OEA treatment restored these
changes in dose-dependent manner (Figure S2E, S2F).
In addition, the phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 was
upregulated in the presence of TGF-β1 stimulation,
consistent with the observed effects on HSC activation,
while OEA (10 μM) reduced the phosphorylation of
Smad2/3 in CFSC simulated with TGF-β1. The altered
pattern of phosphorylation was also effectively blocked
by the PPAR-α antagonist GW6471 (10 μM), further
demonstrating the PPAR-α dependence of the phenomenon
(Figure 6).
Having verified that PPAR-α impacts the TGF-β1/
Smad pathway, we then examined the pathway to better
understand the molecular mechanisms by which it may
influence signaling. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a
putative binding site for the PPAR-α­-RXR-α heterodimer
on the TGF-β1 promotor. A dual-luciferase reporter assay
showed that PPAR-α overexpression slightly enhanced

Following our observations that OEA attenuation
of fibrosis is dependent on PPAR-α, we next sought
to characterize the molecular mechanisms behind the
attenuation. We first explored for changes in TGF-β1
signaling, since that pathway is essential for HSC
activation and liver fibrosis. Numerous lines of evidence
have shown that TGF-β1 treatment upregulates the
expression of several pro-fibrogenic genes such as
α-SMA and Col1a in quiescent fibroblasts [1, 3]. To
assess the impact of OEA on HSCs activation, the
expression levels of α-SMA and Col1a in TGF-β1stimulated HSCs were examined by qPCR. The mRNA
levels of α-SMA and Col1a were markedly induced in the
group of CFSC cells with TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) stimulation
for 48h, while the mRNA levels were suppressed when
treated with OEA in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
5A, 5B). Immunofluorescence and western blot results
showed that OEA treatment dose-dependently inhibited
the protein expression of α-SMA (Figure 5C, 5D), the

and regulates transcription [23]. So far, the effects and
molecular mechanisms of PPAR-α in TGF-β/Smad
signaling remains elusive.
It is also possible that different molecular
mechanisms are responsible for the effects of PPAR-α
in different cell types. After all, it has been reported that
Wy14643 could not reduce phospho-Smad2/3 induced by
TGF-β in rat chondrocytes [24], while, in another paper,
Wy14643 and clofibrate were reported to significantly
decrease phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in 10T1/2
cells [25]. In the present study, we demonstrate that
phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was suppressed by OEA
in CFSC cells, and that these effects were reversed by
blockage of PPAR-α activation. These results suggested
that PPAR-α may antagonize the transcriptional effects
induced by TGF-β1. Previous reports have shown that a
physical interaction between ligand-activated PPAR-α and
Smad4 suppressed TGF-β1-induced integrin transcription,
but a direct binding between them could not be detected
[26]. Our qRT-PCR results indicate that OEA did not
reduce the expression of several genes involved in the
formation of phospho-Smad2/3, (TGFBR1/2 and Smad 4,
as seen in Figure S4B, S4C, S4F), while it increased the
mRNA expression of PPM1A (Figure S4D), a phosphatase
that dephosphorylated and promoted nuclear export of
activated Smad2/3 to terminate TGF-β signaling [23, 27].
It is also possible that the nuclear translocation step is
affected, and raising the possibility that PPAR-α might act
as a gatekeeper of sorts for transcription regulation given
its positioning.
TGF-β1 signaling drives downstream HSC
expression of α-SMA and collagen type 1a/3a, which
are key markers for fibrosis. Overexpressed TGF-β1 has
also been shown to increase ROS levels, which impairs
PPAR-α expression [12] and inhibits PPAR-α activity [28]
in hepatocytes. In the present study, TGF-β1 repressed the
mRNA expression of PPAR-α, which could be reversed
by SB-431542, a TGF-β pathway inhibitor (Figure S5).
At the same time, PPAR-α ligands have been identified
to reduce ROS levels to reverse the PPAR-α reduction
and subsequently alleviate fibrosis [12]. Administration
of OEA induced a partial down-regulation of the TGF-β1
mRNA expression (Figures 3A, 4E) by rescuing PPAR-α
mRNA (Figure S2) and activating JNK and p38 MAPK
[29] to inhibit the activation of HSCs, although PPAR-α
overexpression and OEA did not repress TGF-β promotor
activity directly (Figure S3). OEA treatment also led to the
suppression of vital ECM and matrix remodeling genes,
which contribute greatly to the vicious cycle of worsening
damage. Taken together, these data demonstrate that
endogenous PPAR-α agonist OEA effectively suppressed
activation of HSCs and liver fibrosis through effects on
TGF-β1. Future work to elucidate mechanisms to increase
OEA expression may help further increase its therapeutic
potential.

the TGF-β1 promoter activity (Figure S3A), while OEA
treatment (30, 10, 3 μM) had no effect (Figure S3B). As
such, it seems that OEA does not directly repress TGF-β1
promotor activation by increasing PPAR-α activity or
expression. We also detected the genes involved into the
formation and degradation of phospho-Smad2/3. The
mRNA expression of TGFBR1, Smad4 and PPM1A all
increased after OEA treatment, while that of TGFBR2 and
Smad7 was not affected (Figure S4). As such, it seems
that the influence of OEA-activated PPAR-α on pSmad2/3
occurs through other mechanisms.

DISCUSSION
The critical roles played by endogenous ligands
in mediating cellular signaling is becoming increasingly
appreciated, with many metabolites now being understood
to have potent effects on cellular behavior. Our present
study demonstrates that the endogenous PPAR-α ligand,
OEA, can significantly suppress the pro-fibrotic cytokine
TGF-β1 negatively regulate genes in the TGF-β1 signaling
pathway (α-SMA, collagen 1a, and collagen 3a) in mice
models of hepatic fibrosis. We also show that OEA
treatment inhibited the increase of serum ALT, AST, and
hepatic TG levels, downregulated the adhesion molecules
ICAM and VCAM, and reduced the gene expression
of matrix remodeling enzymes TIMP1, MMP2, and
MMP9 to help slow the pathogenesis of fibrosis. These
improvements as a result of OEA treatment were lost in
PPAR-α knockout mice models, showing that the effects
were almost completely dependent on PPAR-α function.
Although similar anti-fibrogenic properties of synthetic
PPAR-α agonists, Wy-14643 and fenofibrate, have been
reported in TAA, MCD, CCl4 and ethanol-induced liver
fibrosis [11, 12, 21], previous studies had not elucidated
the mechanisms behind the response. In addition, offtarget roles of these synthetic ligands may prevent them
from being fully effective. For instance, Wy-14643 caused
regression of hepatic fibrosis in MCD dietary feeding
models, but failed to reduce the increased TGF-β1 mRNA
expression [11], making it unclear as to if it could be truly
effective at longer-term amelioration.
Liver fibrosis is presently understood to be a
process of sterile inflammation caused by a vicious cycle
of hepatic damage driving HSC activation and worsening
hepatic damage [12]. Hepatic injury caused by MCD
diet and TAA increases ER stress and induces MAPK/
ERK activation, which is considered as an indispensable
step for the overexpression of TGF-β1 mRNA [22]. As
a critical survival factor for HSCs, TGF-β1 plays an
important role in triggering and maintaining the vicious
cycle. In the canonical TGF-β1 signal transduction
pathway, binding of TGF-β1 to TGF-β1 type I/II receptor
induces phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which is released
into the cytosol and results in dimerization with Smad4.
The heterodimer then translocates into the nucleus

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Liver histological studies
Fresh liver biopsy specimen fixed in the 10%
neutral-buffered formalin for 3 days and then embedded
with paraffin for histological examinations. Sections of 5
μm were cut by a Leica SM2010 R Sliding microtome
(Shanghai, China) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin
(H&E) or Sirius red to assess liver damage and fibrosis
development. To determine the level of lipid accumulation
in liver, frozen sections of formalin-fixed liver were
stained with Oil red O. Stained areas were viewed and
imaged through standard microscopy (Nikon, Shanghai,
China).

Reagents
OEA was synthesized in our lab as previously
described [30]. Recombinant Human TGF-β1 was from
R&D Systems (Shanghai, China). Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), TAA and all other chemicals were obtained
from Sigma–Aldrich (Shanghai, China) if not mentioned
otherwise. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from
Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). MK886, a PPAR-α inhibitor,
was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA).
GW6471, a PPAR-α antagonist, was purchased from R&D
Systems (Shanghai, China). Alanine transaminase (ALT)
and aspartate transaminase (AST) commercial assay kits
were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute (Nanjing, China).
The chemical constituents were dissolved in saline
supplemented with 5% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400)
and 5% Tween-80 for the in vivo studies. For the in
vitro studies, OEA was dissolved in DMSO to a series
concentration of 100-3 mmol/L (stock solution) and then
diluted in the culture medium to 100-3 µmol/L.

Plasma and hepatic biochemistry assays
For testing liver function, plasma aspartate
transaminase (ALT), alanine transaminase (AST) and
hepatic triglyceride (TG) concentration were determined
by a Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO Microplate
Spectrophotometer with commercial kits.

Cell culture
CFSC, HSC cell lines were first obtained from
cirrhotic rat liver, and have a similar phenotype to that of
early passage primary HSCs. CFSC cells (kind gift from
Dr. Chenggang Zhu) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All
cells were cultured in 6-well culture plates under 37°C
and 5% CO­2 in an incubator. The medium was replaced
every two days, and the cells were harvested and diluted
at a ratio of 1:3 twice a week. In experiments, HSCs were
pretreated with the experimental concentration of OEA
before stimulation with 5 ng/mL TGF-β1.

Animals and treatments
The Sv/129 mice were purchased from the Model
Animal Research Center (Nanjing, China). The PPAR-α
knockout mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All procedures were in
performed in compliance with the guidelines for animal
care and use and were approved by the Committee for
Animal Research at Xiamen University. The mice were
maintained in a room with controlled temperature (21–
23°C), humidity (55–60%) and lighting (12 h light/dark
cycles) and given water ad libitum. Mice were randomly
divided for MCD and TAA experiments. In the MCD-diet
feeding experiment, wild-type Sv/129 mice and PPAR-α
knockout mice were each divided into three groups (n
= 8 /group): (i) control group received normal diet; (ii)
fed with MCD diet and injected with the vehicle (5%
Tween-80 + 5% PEG400 + 90% saline, 5 mL/kg/day, 8
weeks, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.); (iii) fed with MCD
diet along with OEA administration (5 mg/kg/day; 8
weeks, i.p.). In another set of experiment, all the wildtype mice and PPAR-α knockout mice were given standard
chow diet, and were randomly separated into three groups:
the control group was not administrated TAA or OEA but
was injected with the saline; the TAA group was injected
with TAA (160 mg/kg, three times per week, 6 weeks,
dissolved in saline, i.p.) plus the corresponding vehicle;
the OEA group was both injected with TAA and OEA (5
mg/kg/day; 6 weeks, i.p.).

fibrosis. Annu Rev Pathol. 2011; 6:425-456.

Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature
(RT). after blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in PBS for 1 h at RT, the cells were incubated with primary
Mouse anti-α-SMA (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich) or Rabbit antip-Smad2/3 (1:100, Cell Signalling Technology) antibodies
diluted with 1% BSA overnight at 4°C, followed by three
washes with PBS and incubation for 2 h with secondary
antibodies (donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa
Fluor 594 or donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa
Fluor 594) diluted with 1% BSA for 1 h at RT. Cell nuclei
were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Images were captured using a laser scanning confocal
microscope (FluoView 1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
