ABSTRACT

Toxicity evaluation is an extremely important process during drug development.
It is usually initiated by experiments on animals, which is time-consuming and costly.
To speed up such a process, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
study was performed to develop a computational model for correlating the structures
of 581 aromatic compounds with their aquatic toxicity to tetrahymena pyriformis. A
set of 68 molecular descriptors derived solely from the structures of the aromatic
compounds were calculated based on Gaussian 03, HyperChem 7.5, and TSAR V3.3. A
comprehensive feature selection method, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance
(mRMR)-genetic algorithm (GA)-support vector regression (SVR) method, was applied
to select the best descriptor subset in QSAR analysis. The SVR method was employed
to model the toxicity potency from a training set of 500 compounds. Five-fold crossvalidation method was used to optimize the parameters of SVR model. The new SVR
model was tested on an independent dataset of 81 compounds. Both high internal
consistent and external predictive rates were obtained, indicating the SVR model is
very promising to become an effective tool for fast detecting the toxicity.

As is well known, many different QSAR
(Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models
have been developed for drug development (see, e.g.,
[1–7]. The goal of this study was to develop a new QSAR
model that can be used to predict the aquatic toxicity of
aromatic compounds to tetrahymena pyriformis.

INTRODUCTION
Aromatic compounds are used in many industries
and consumer products. Many of them are naturally
occurring. Hence, they have become widely distributed
in nature. Owing to their prevalence in the environment
and their likelihood to often elicit unknown toxic effects,
it is important to determine their potential hazard.
Experimental determination of the toxicity is time
consuming and expensive, and can be carried out only for
compounds already synthesized. There is a strong need
to develop computational tools that can used to predict
toxicity. The information thus obtained would be very
useful in prioritizing the targets concerned.

RESULTS
Descriptor selection by mRMR-GA-SVR
To examine the quality of a predictor, we need a
metrics to quantitatively measure its accuracy. In the
current study, a quantity called RMSE was introduced for
such a purpose, as defined by

the model. The predictive power of SVR model was
evaluated by a quality function Q2 as defined by

where ei and pi denote, respectively, the measured and
predicted values for the i-th sample; n the total number
of the samples in the training dataset. Obviously, the
smaller the value of RMSE the better the set of selected
descriptors.
Listed in Table 1 are the optimal RMSE values
obtained by mRMR-GA-SVR under different types of
kernel function. As shown in the table, the RMSE value is
smaller when using six-descriptor subset under polynomial
kernel function. The selected descriptors for QSAR model
are energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO), the difference between HOMO and LUMO
(ΔE), molecular weight (MW), logarithm of the octanolwater partition coefficient (logP), the number of halogen
atoms (NHal), and the number of H-bond donors (NHdon).

Q

In a benchmark test, the SVR was compared with
PLS and ANN (artificial neural network) methods, as
shown in Table 2. As shown from the table, the SVR
model outperformed both the PLS model and ANN
model, indicating that the SVR model would have better
generalization ability.

Effects of the descriptors to the model
The current model was built based on six
selected descriptors. To investigate into the effects of
the descriptors on the SVR model, let us consider the
following outcomes. The quality function Q2 was reduced
from 0.84 to 0.55 (Table 3) when excluding the MW
(molecular weight) descriptor, indicating that molecular
weight or volume might have some effects on the toxicity
of aromatic compounds.

Thus, it follows

The sensitivity analysis (SA) method was employed

The SA of logP, HOMO and Mass are given in Figures
4-9, respectively. It can be seen from Figures 5-7 that the
value of logIGC50-1 is increasing with the increment of
logP, MW and ΔE. Interestingly, just the opposite trend
was observed from Figure 4, where the greater the LUMO
is, the lower the logIGC50-1 would be, implying that
electrons transfer in the process of toxicity interaction is
from organic compounds to biological molecules.

and interaction with the molecular site of action. The

DISCUSSION

In this study, the polynomial kernel function was
adopted. The aforementioned SVR model contains two
uncertain parameters. One is C for the regularization
parameter, and the other is ε for the insensitive loss
function. Their values were determined by optimizing
RMSE (cf. Eq.1) via the 5-fold cross-validation on the
training dataset as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2; i.e.,

stability of a molecule. The descriptor LUMO is related
to the relative electrophilicity. In the present study the ab
initio Hartree-Fock level calculation provides a strong
evidence of toxicity prediction ability of the global and
local electrophilicity together with molecular stability.
The descriptor NHdon plays a significant role in solubility
behavior. As the hydrogen bond formation increases, water
solubility increases (or n-octanol solubility decreases).
MW is a general descriptor of size. Halogenated aromatic
compounds are related to both the leaving and the
electron-withdrawing properties of the group. The toxicity
potency is imparted by the leaving ability of the halogen.
The addition of the halogen atom increases toxicity in
excess of what can be accounted for by hydrophobicity.

how to provide a publically accessible web-server. In the
rest of this paper, we are to address these point-by-point.

Benchmark dataset
In literature, the benchmark dataset usually consists
of a training dataset and a testing dataset: the former is
constructed for the purpose of training a proposed model,
while the latter for the purpose of testing it. As pointed out
by a comprehensive review [20], however, there is no need
to separate a benchmark dataset into a training dataset and
a testing dataset for validating a prediction method if it is
tested by the jackknife [21] or subsampling (K-fold) crossvalidation because the outcome thus obtained is actually
from a combination of many different independent dataset
tests.
The benchmark dataset used in this study consists
of 581 aromatic compounds with structurally highly
heterogeneity and their corresponding toxicity data to
the ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis in term of log(IGC50-1)
(mmol/l), which means the logarithmic value of the 50%
inhibitory growth concentration (IGC50) of the ciliates.
The toxicity values were taken from the literature [22–
29]. A full list of the toxicity values as well as molecular
descriptors, or sample formulation [8], used in the
SVR model is given in Supporting Information 1. The
compounds with the toxicity values ranged from -1.26 to
2.74 log units included a large variety of classes: phenols,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
To establish a really useful statistical predictor,
according to the Chou’s 5-step rule [8] and realized in a
series of recent publications [9–19], we should considered
the following five procedures: (1) how to construct or
select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the
model; (2) how to represent the samples with an effective
mathematical expression that can truly reflect their
essential correlation with the target concerned; (3) how
to introduce or develop a powerful algorithm to run the
prediction; (4) how to properly conduct cross-validation
tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy; (5)

anilines, amides, carbonyls, nitro-compounds, cyanides,
carboxylic acids, halogenated compounds (F, Cl, Br, I),
esters, ethers, pyridines, quinines, and so forth.
The aforementioned 581 chemicals were divided
into two sets: one with 500 chemicals used for training the
model, and one with 81 chemicals for testing the model. In
other words, the benchmark dataset was divided into two
subsets: the training dataset and the independent dataset.
The Chemdraw Ultra Version 7.0 (CambridgeSoft
Corporation, 2002) software was used for drawing the
molecular structures. The molecular structures were
optimized by use of the Gaussian 03 [30] (B3LYP/6311G**) or HyperChem Version 7.5 (HyperCube Inc.,
2002) (MM+). Molecular descriptors were obtained by
Gaussian 03, HyperChem Version 7.5, and TSAR Version
3.3 (Oxford Molecular Limited, 2000) software’s. The
mRMR feature pre-selection was performed by using a
Red Hat Linux 32-bit-machine version package (http://
home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/). A (procedure for
feature selection and a software package containing
SVR and PLS methods were programmed in our lab.
The validation of the software has been tested in some
applications [31–33].

refinement, the Polak-Ribiere routine with RMS gradient
of 0.001 kcal Å mol-1 as the termination condition was
used.
Other descriptors were calculated with TSAR
Version 3.3 as noted in Table 4.

mRMR
The mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum
relevance) method [39] selects features that have the
highest relevance with the target class and are also
minimally redundant, i.e., selects features that are
maximally dissimilar to each other. The idea of mRMR
has been widely used to analyze various biological
sequences (see, e.g., [10, 40–44]). For more information
about mRMR, see [39, 40], where a detailed procedure
has been elaborated. Hence there is no need to repeat here.

Descriptor selection for mRMR-GA-SVR
The performance of QSAR model closely depends
on how to select the features of molecular structures (Table
5). In this study, a comprehensive feature selection method
called mRMR-GA-SVR was introduced as described
below.
In the first stage, the mRMR approach was applied
for feature selection as done in [45]. There are three
distinct advantages by doing so: (1) it can select the
features that have better representativity for the targets
concerned; (2) it can avoid the high dimension disaster
problem [46]; and (3) it can narrow down the search space
for the subsequent study.
In the second stage, a GA-based SVR or GA-SVR
approach was applied to refines the mRMR-selectedfeatures. The GA algorithm can be found in [47, 48]. The
codes for GA-SVR program had been written in our lab
using the Visual Basic language.

Molecular descriptors or sample formulation
In developing a powerful statistical predictor, it is
very important to represent the statistical samples with an
effective formulation that can truly reflect their essential
correlation with the target concerned, as done in [34, 35]
for proteome systems and in [36–38] for genome systems.
Here we are dealing with a compound system, and the
corresponding samples should be formulated in a different
approach as given below.
The 68 descriptors were calculated with different
software and they can be classified into six groups:
quantum chemical, electrostatic, topological, geometrical,
constitutional, and physicochemical descriptors. A full
list of descriptors calculated is provided in Table 4. The
methods to calculate descriptors are given below.
The 8 quantum chemical descriptors were obtained
using Gaussian 03 (shown in Table 4). All the geometries
of the aromatic molecules (except I) are minimized at the
Hartree-Fock level of theory with the 6-311 G** basis set
followed by frequency calculations using the Gaussian 03
package.
The 6 electrostatic descriptors were calculated
using the semi-empirical quantum-chemical method PM3
in HyperChem 7.5 software package (listed in Table 4).
Geometry optimizations based on molecular mechanics
(using the MM+ force field) and semi-empirical quantum
mechanical calculations using PM3 were used to find
the coordinates of molecular structures that represent a
potential energy minimum. For geometry optimization
using both molecular mechanics and semi-empirical
quantum mechanical calculations, at the final stage of

SVR algorithm
The Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machinelearning algorithm, which has been widely used in many
areas of bioinformatics (see, e.g., [10, 37, 49–54]). The
key idea of SVM is to construct a separating hyper-plane
so as to maximize the margin between the positive dataset
and negative dataset. For a brief formulation of SVM and
how it works, see the papers [55, 56]; for more details
about SVM, see a monograph [57]. In SVR, the basic idea
is to map the data X into a higher-dimensional feature
space F via a nonlinear mapping Φ and then to do linear
regression in this space. For more details about SVR, see
Supporting Information 2.

Web server
As pointed out in [58], user-friendly and publicly
accessible web-servers represent the future direction
49366

Oncotarget

for developing practically more useful predictors or any
computational tools. Actually, user-friendly web-servers
as given in a series of recent publications [9, 10, 59–68]
will significantly enhance the impacts of theoretical work
because they can attract the broad experimental scientists
[69]. Once the funding is available for purchasing the
needed facilities, we will establish a web-server for the
new QSAR model reported in this paper.

The SVR approach was used to develop a new
QSAR model for predicting logIGC50-1 for a wideranging and heterogeneous set of aromatic compounds.
The mRMR-GA-SVR method was applied for descriptor
selection. The results have indicated that the mRMR-GASVR method is a very effective for QSAR analysis. The
prediction ability of SVR was tested by an independent
dataset of 81 aromatic compounds. The R2 for the training
set for SVR is 0.84. And the Q2 for the independent test
set is 0.77. It is anticipated that SVR will become a useful
high throughput tool for detecting the potential toxicity
to Tetrahymena pyriformis for a diverse set of aromatic
compounds.
