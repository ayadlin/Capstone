Abstract
The protein kinase BRAF is a key component of the RAS–RAF signaling pathway which plays an important role
in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in BRAF at codon 600 promote catalytic
activity and are associated with 8% of all human (solid) tumors, including 8% to 10% of colorectal cancers (CRC).
Here, we report the preclinical characterization of vemurafenib (RG7204; PLX4032; RO5185426), a ﬁrst-in-class,
speciﬁc small molecule inhibitor of BRAFV600E in BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines and tumor xenograft models. As a
single agent, vemurafenib shows dose-dependent inhibition of ERK and MEK phosphorylation, thereby arresting
cell proliferation in BRAFV600-expressing cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in BRAFV600E bearing xenograft
models. Because vemurafenib has shown limited single-agent clinical activity in BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic
CRC, we therefore explored a range of combination therapies, with both standard agents and targeted inhibitors
in preclinical xenograft models. In a BRAF-mutant CRC xenograft model with de novo resistance to vemurafenib
(RKO), tumor growth inhibition by vemurafenib was enhanced by combining with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206).
The addition of vemurafenib to capecitabine and/or bevacizumab, cetuximab and/or irinotecan, or erlotinib
resulted in increased antitumor activity and improved survival in xenograft models. Together, our ﬁndings
suggest that the administration of vemurafenib in combination with standard-of-care or novel targeted therapies
may lead to enhanced and sustained clinical antitumor efﬁcacy in CRCs harboring the BRAFV600E mutation.

Introduction
The protein kinase BRAF is a key component of the RAS–
RAF cellular signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation
and survival under the control of extracellular growth factors
and hormones (1). However, mutations in the kinase domain of
the BRAF gene can lead to constitutive activation of the
enzyme, resulting in dysregulated downstream signaling via
MEK and ERK, excessive cell proliferation, and survival independent of external cellular signals. Consequently, the RAS–
RAF–MEK–ERK pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis
(1–4). It is estimated that approximately 8% of human cancers
harbor BRAF mutations (5–7).

Oncogenic BRAF signaling is implicated in approximately
50% of melanomas, 30% to 70% of papillary thyroid tumors,
30% of low-grade serous ovarian tumors, and 8% to 10% of
colorectal cancers (CRC; refs. 2, 5). The majority of BRAF
mutations in human cancer cell lines involve replacement of
a single amino acid, V600, located within the kinase domain (8).
In metastatic CRC (mCRC), a growing body of evidence indicates that BRAF mutations, like KRAS mutations, are a negative
prognostic factor and may predict resistance to epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapies (9–13). Furthermore, KRAS and BRAF mutations seem to be mutually
exclusive in colorectal tumors, highlighting the importance of
BRAF mutations in tumorigenesis for a subset of patients
(5, 14).
Given the association between mutated BRAF and human
tumorigenesis, a number of agents which speciﬁcally target
BRAF are in development for the treatment of cancer. Vemurafenib (RG7204, PLX4032; RO5185426) is a potent and selective
small molecule inhibitor of BRAF (15) that has been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of latestage (metastatic) or unresectable melanoma in patients
whose tumors express BRAFV600. The pivotal phase III study
comparing vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) against dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated, BRAFV600E-bearing
metastatic melanoma reported (at interim analysis) statistically signiﬁcant improvements in progression-free survival
(HR ¼ 0.26; P < 0.001) and overall survival (HR ¼ 0.37; P < 0.001)

in patients receiving vemurafenib (16). Response rates were
48% for patients receiving vemurafenib and 5% for those
receiving dacarbazine. Conﬁrmed response rates above 50%
with vemurafenib monotherapy (960 mg twice daily) were
shown in phase I and phase II clinical studies in previously
treated patients with BRAFV600E-bearing metastatic melanoma
(17, 18), showing the proof-of-concept for mutated BRAF as a
bona ﬁde oncogenic target.
Evidence of clinical activity with vemurafenib has also been
observed in heavily pretreated mCRC patients with tumors
harboring the BRAFV600E mutation, supporting BRAF as a
therapeutic target for treatment of this disease. Single-agent
vemurafenib was administered in a phase I extension trial of
patients with previously treated mCRC. In this trial, 1 conﬁrmed partial response and 4 minor responses (10% shrinkage) were noted among 19 evaluable patients, with 5 patients
showing a mixed response pattern (both regressing and progressing lesions; ref. 19). These ﬁndings may reﬂect a more
heterogeneous pattern of BRAF activation in CRC patients,
particularly in those with a mixed response. These observations suggest that additional molecular factors may modulate
the response to BRAF inhibitors in CRC, and that combining
other agents with vemurafenib may be required to produce
sustained antitumor efﬁcacy.
The aim of the preclinical studies reported here was to
evaluate the antitumor activity of vemurafenib in CRC cell
lines and xenograft models, to identify combination partners
to achieve optimal efﬁcacy. Two strategies were followed to
select agents for combination regimens. First, targeted
agents with a strong molecular rationale for combination
in CRC were selected for testing in BRAF-mutant CRC cell
lines and xenografts with speciﬁcally deﬁned molecular
features. This category included inhibitors of AKT (MK2206) and EGFR (erlotinib). The second strategy was to
determine whether addition of vemurafenib to agents
approved for mCRC (such as capecitabine, bevacizumab,
cetuximab and/or irinotecan) could enhance efﬁcacy, to
determine whether vemurafenib could be incorporated into
current standard-of-care regimens. Together, these experiments provide the rationale and preclinical proof-of-concept
for the design of future combination trials with vemurafenib,
to provide increased clinical beneﬁt for patients with BRAFmutated mCRC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The Colo741 cell line was purchased from Sigma; all other
cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. All cell lines were passaged for fewer than 3 months
from the stocks of ﬁrst or second passage of the original ones
and were authenticated by sequencing the status of BRAF. All
cell lines were maintained in the designated medium supplemented with the indicated concentration of heat-inactivated
FBS (HI-FBS; Gibco/BRL) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Gibco/
BRL).
The following antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology: anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204; #9101),

anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221; #9121), anti-MEK1/2
(#9122), anti-cyclin D (#2926), anti-pAKT (Ser473) (#9171), and
anti-cleaved PARP (#9541). Anti-ERK1/2 antibody (06-182) was
sourced from Millipore. Anti-b-actin antibody (A5316) was
purchased from Sigma.
Vemurafenib was synthesized by F. Hoffmann-La Roche and
AKTi (MK-2206) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
Cellular proliferation assays
Cellular proliferation was evaluated using the MTT assay
(Sigma). Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates
at a density of 1,000 to 5,000 cells per well in a volume of 180
mL. For the assay, vemurafenib was prepared at 10 times the
ﬁnal assay concentration in media containing 1% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Twenty-four hours after cell plating, 20 mL
of the appropriate dilution was added to plates in duplicate.
Cells were assayed for proliferation 5 days after treatment
according to the procedure originally described by Mosmann (20). Percent inhibition was calculated using the
formula:
Percent inhibition ¼


Mean absorbance of experimental wells
100 
 100
Mean absorbance of control wells
The IC50 was determined from the regression of a plot of
the logarithm of the concentration versus percent inhibition
by XLﬁt (version 4.2; IDBS) using a dose–response one-site
model.
Western blot analysis
Cells were seeded at appropriate density (70%–75% conﬂuent) in 6-well plates one day before drug treatment. Following
exposure to various concentrations of drug for 2 hours at 37 C
with 5% CO2, cells were harvested and lysed immediately with
1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation on ice for 20 minutes, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 10 minutes to clear the insoluble debris. The protein
concentrations of the lysates were determined.
Equal amounts of total protein for cell lysates and for tumor
lysates were resolved on 4% to 12% NuPage gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) before being blotted and probed
with the indicated antibodies. The chemiluminescent signal
was generated with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection
Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with a Fujiﬁlm LAS-3000 imager. The densitometric quantitation of speciﬁc bands was determined using Multi Gauge software
(Fujiﬁlm).
Animals
Athymic nude mice (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu, obtained from
Charles River Laboratories), aged 10 to 12 weeks and weighing
approximately 23 to 25 g were used. Animal health was
monitored daily by observation and sentinel animal blood
sample analysis. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, local regulations, and protocols approved by the

BRAF Inhibitor Vemurafenib in Preclinical Colorectal Cancer Models

Roche Animal Care and Use Committee in an AAALAC accredited facility.
Tumor xenografts
HT29, RKO, HCT116, and LoVo cells were scaled up, harvested, and prepared so that each mouse received 3  106 cells
in 0.2 mL calcium- and magnesium-free PBS. Cells were
implanted subcutaneously in the right ﬂank.
Test agents for in vivo studies
Vemurafenib, formulated in the same high-bioavailability
microprecipitated bulk powder formulation that is used in
clinical trials, was suspended at concentrations as needed in an
aqueous vehicle containing 2% Klucel LF (Hercules Inc.) and
adjusted to pH 4 with dilute HCl. MK-2206 (Selleck Inc.) was
formulated in 30% Captisol (CyDex Pharmaceuticals). Capecitabine (Xeloda; Roche Laboratories) suspensions and clinical
grade bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc.) were prepared
as previously described (21). Irinotecan (Camptosar; Pﬁzer)
was provided in a stock sterile saline solution of 20 mg/mL,
which was diluted as required with sterile saline. Cetuximab
(Erbitux; ImClone Systems, Inc) was purchased as a 2 mg/mL
solution and diluted with sterile PBS immediately prior to
administration. Erlotinib (Tarceva; Roche Laboratories) was
formulated as a suspension with sodium carboxymethylcellulose and Tween 80 in water for injection.
Vemurafenib monotherapy studies
Treatment was started 13, 11, or 17 days post-cell implant for
HT29, HCT116, and LoVo xenografts, respectively. Vehicle
control and vemurafenib were given orally using a sterile 1mL syringe and 18-gauge gavage needle (0.2 mL per animal, b.i.
d) at 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg b.i.d (8 hours apart) for 18 days
for HT29. Vehicle and 75 mg/kg b.i.d were administered in a
similar fashion for 17 and 18 days for HCT116 and LoVo,
respectively.
Combination studies
For the purposes of this article, the individual drugs used in
doublet and triplet regimens will be referred to using the
following nomenclature: vemurafenib, V; capecitabine, C; bevacizumab, B; irinotecan, I; cetuximab, E. A schematic of doublet
and triplet dosing regimens is provided in Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A.
Vemurafenib/MK-2206 combination studies
Treatment was started on day 10 post-cell implant. Vemurafenib was administered at 75 mg/kg b.i.d. and MK-2206 was
administered at an optimal dose of 120 mg/kg 3/wk (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; ref. 22); both were dosed orally
using a sterile 1-mL syringe and 18-gauge gavage needle (0.2
mL per animal) for approximately 3 weeks. The control group
received vemurafenib vehicle twice daily and MK-2206 vehicle
3/wk, administered collectively in an equivalent fashion to
the combination drug group.
Vemurafenib/erlotinib combination studies
Treatment was started on day 12 post-cell implant; vemurafenib was administered at 75 mg/kg b.i.d. and erlotinib was

www.aacrjournals.org

administered orally using a sterile 1-mL syringe and 18-gauge
gavage needle (0.2 mL/animal) at the optimal dose of 100 mg/
kg q.d. (23) and at 67 mg/kg q.d., as monotherapy and in
combination for approximately 3 weeks. The control group
received vemurafenib vehicle twice daily and erlotinib vehicle
once daily, administered collectively in an equivalent fashion to
the combination drug-treated group.
Vemurafenib/capecitabine/bevacizumab (VCB-7 and
VCB-14) combination studies
Treatment commenced approximately 14 days post-cell
implant. Vemurafenib at 50 mg/kg was dosed orally twice
daily for 3 weeks. Capecitabine was dosed orally using a sterile
1-mL syringe and 18-gauge gavage needle [0.2 mL/animal, q.d.;
267 or 400 mg/kg/d (14-day schedule, Fig. 4A)] and 467 or 700
mg/kg/d (7-day schedule, Fig. 4A) over 3 weeks. The 400 and
700 mg/kg doses correspond to the previously determined
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the 14- and 7-day schedules, respectively (21). Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) was dosed
intraperitoneally using a sterile 1-mL syringe and 26-gauge
needle (0.2 mL/animal, twice a week) on a Tuesday/Friday
schedule. The control group received vemurafenib vehicle
twice daily, capecitabine vehicle once daily, and bevacizumab
vehicle twice a week, administered collectively in an equivalent
fashion to the combination drug groups.
Vemurafenib/irinotecan/cetuximab combination
studies
Treatment began on day 11 post-cell implant (refer to Fig. 5A
for a schematic of the dosing regimen). Vemurafenib at 25 mg/
kg b.i.d was dosed orally for approximately 3 weeks. Cetuximab
(40 mg/kg) was dosed intraperitoneally using a sterile 1-mL
syringe and 26-gauge needle (0.2 mL/animal, twice a week) on a
Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday schedule. Irinotecan (40
mg/kg) was dosed intraperitoneally using a sterile 1-mL
syringe and 26-gauge needle (0.2 mL/animal, every 4 days for
5 doses). On the ﬁrst day of dosing, irinotecan and cetuximab
were dosed in the morning and the ﬁrst dose of vemurafenib
was 8 hours later. Dosing for the remainder of the study was
concomitant. The control group received vemurafenib vehicle
twice daily, cetuximab vehicle twice a week, and irinotecan
vehicle every 4 days, administered collectively in an equivalent
fashion to the most intense combination drug group.
Toxicity monitoring and efﬁcacy endpoints
Treatment groups comprised 10 animals. Methods were as
described previously (21). Brieﬂy, tolerability was assessed in
all experiments by average percentage weight change and
toxicity, deﬁned as 20% or more of animals showing 20% or
more body weight loss and/or mortality. Tumor volume and
weight were recorded 2 to 3 times a week for all animals in the
study.
Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula:
[D  (d2)]/2 (in which D ¼ large diameter of tumor; d ¼ small
diameter of tumor). Tumor volumes of treated groups were
presented as percentages of tumor volumes of control groups
(%T/C) using the formula: 100  [(T  T0)/(C  C0)]. Tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) and/or percent change in tumor

volume was calculated with formula ((T  T0)/T0)  100
(T ¼ mean tumor volume of a treated group on a speciﬁc day
during the experiment; T0 ¼ mean tumor volume of the same
treated group on the ﬁrst day of treatment; C ¼ mean tumor
volume of a control group on the speciﬁc day during the
experiment; C0 ¼ mean tumor volume of the same treated
group on the ﬁrst day of treatment).
Survival was calculated using a cutoff tumor volume of 1,500
mm3 as a surrogate for mortality. Increase in life span (ILS) was
calculated using the formula: 100  [(median survival day of
treated group  median survival day of control group)/median
survival day of control group].

Results
Vemurafenib effects on cellular proliferation and
pathway inhibition in CRC cell lines
The effect of vemurafenib on cellular proliferation was
evaluated using 10 CRC cell lines: 3 expressing BRAFWT, 1
expressing BRAFG596R (NCI-H508), and 6 expressing
BRAFV600E. The 3 BRAFWT cell lines harbor KRAS mutations,
whereas the BRAFG596R and BRAFV600E cell lines express
RASWT. In 4 of the 6 BRAFV600E-expressing cell lines (HT29,
Colo205, Colo741, and LS411N), vemurafenib inhibited cellular
proliferation with IC50 values ranging from 0.025 to 0.35 mmol/
L (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of cellular proliferation correlated to
inhibition of pathway activity in these 4 cell lines, as shown
representatively for HT29 (Fig. 1B). In 2 of 6 BRAFV600E-expressing cell lines (RKO and SW1417), vemurafenib had only
modest effects on cellular proliferation (Fig. 1A). Therefore,
these 2 BRAFV600E-expressing CRC cell lines are de novo
(innately) resistant to vemurafenib treatment. Interestingly,
vemurafenib was able to inhibit ERK and MEK phosphorylation in RKO cells but had minimal inhibitory effect on pERK

Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was undertaken using the rank sum test
and one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Bonferroni t test (SigmaStat, version 2.0, Jandel Scientiﬁc). Median survival was determined utilizing Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Survival in
treated groups was compared with the vehicle group and
comparisons made using the log-rank test (Graph Pad Prism).
Differences were considered signiﬁcant when P  0.05.

BRAF Inhibitor Vemurafenib in Preclinical Colorectal Cancer Models

In vitro and in vivo investigations of PI3K pathway
activity in RKO, a cell line with de novo resistance to
vemurafenib
Minimal antiproliferative activity of vemurafenib was
observed in the BRAFV600E-bearing RKO cell line (IC50 of
4.57 mmol/L; Fig. 1A); however, dose-dependent inhibition of
ERK and MEK phosphorylation did occur, with calculated IC50
values of 67 and 572 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B). Therefore,
the de novo resistance to vemurafenib is unlikely to be caused
by insensitivity to RAF–MEK–ERK pathway inhibition.
Sequencing the PIK3CA gene in RKO cells identiﬁed a hotspot mutation, H1047R, located in the C-terminal portion of
the kinase domain of the catalytic subunit p110alpha, coded by
PIK3CA (38). PIK3CAH1047R has been reported to occur at high
frequency in a number of human cancers (39, 40), and an
increasing body of evidence suggests that activation of the
PI3K pathway by PIK3CA mutations such as H1047R confers
resistance to trastuzumab in breast cancer cells (41, 42). We
speculated that the de novo vemurafenib resistance of
BRAFV600E-expressing RKO cells could be mediated by activation of the PI3K pathway, and we therefore tested whether
inhibition of PI3K signaling would sensitize RKO cells to the
antiproliferative effect of vemurafenib. Indeed, treatment with
vemurafenib and a pan-AKT inhibitor (MK-2206; 22) caused
synergistic antiproliferative effects reﬂected by combination
index (CI) scores of 0.691, 0.353, and 0.194 at EC50, EC75, and
EC90, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Pharmacodynamic markers of the BRAF and PI3K pathways
were also examined. At the selected doses, combination treatment with vemurafenib and MK-2206 (AKTi) abrogated pERK
and pAKT activation, and the combination was required for
maximal inhibition of cell-cycle progression (indicated by
decreased levels of cyclin D1) and induction of apoptosis
(indicated by increased levels of cleaved PARP; Fig. 2B). In a
BRAF-mutant cell line with de novo resistance conferred by an
activating PI3K mutation, both pathways seem critical for

and pMEK in SW1417 cells (Fig. 1B). The potential mechanism
of resistance for SW1417 is currently under investigation and
that for RKO was explored as discussed below.
Vemurafenib displayed minimal inhibition of cellular proliferation on H508 cells that express mutant BRAFG596R (IC50
value 9.89 mmol/L, Fig. 1A). This correlated with a lack of
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Vemurafenib did not inhibit cellular proliferation of any
BRAFWT-expressing cell lines, with IC50 values more than
10 mmol/L. This observation is consistent with previously
reported insensitivity to vemurafenib of other BRAFWT cancer
cell lines (24–30). Also, as previously observed for BRAFWTexpressing melanoma and thyroid cancer cell lines, vemurafenib induced ERK and MEK phosphorylation in HCT116 cells
which express KRASG13D (Fig. 1B). The mechanism of this
paradoxical activation of ERK in cancer cells expressing
BRAFWT by RAF inhibitors has been explored (31–34). One
proposed mechanism is through upstream pathway priming
(e.g., activated RTK, RAS mutation; refs. 35–37); it is noted that
in our case, all 3 BRAFWT-expressing CRC cell lines harbor
mutant KRAS.

Monotherapy efﬁcacy of vemurafenib in the BRAFV600Eexpressing HT29 CRC xenograft model
An efﬁcacy study exploring dose response was conducted
in a BRAFV600E-expressing HT29 CRC xenograft model. TGI
and animal survival relative to vehicle control were determined for a range of vemurafenib dosing regimens (25,
50, 75, and 100 mg/kg b.i.d.). Dose-dependent TGI was
observed up to 75 mg/kg b.i.d. TGI and ILS observed at
doses of 75 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg b.i.d. were statistically
equivalent (P > 0.05; Fig. 3A). The relationship between
vemurafenib plasma concentration and TGI was investigated in the same efﬁcacy study. Mouse plasma samples
were collected at various time points after the last oral
treatment of vemurafenib, and vemurafenib levels were
subsequently quantitated. The mean plasma exposures
(AUC0–24 h) were estimated to be 1,250, 2,340, 3,070, and
3,810 mmol/L h, over the range of vemurafenib dosing regimens (25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg, respectively; Supplementary
Table S1). The treated mice exhibited near dose-proportional increases in exposure, with no observed plateau; in
general, higher vemurafenib concentrations were associated
with greater tumor inhibition and increased survival (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Table S1). For patients in the phase I
clinical trial of vemurafenib who received the MTD of 960 mg
b.i.d, the mean the AUC0–24 h was 1,741  639 mmol/L h (17).
This is consistent with the preclinically identiﬁed target
exposure for TGI (1,250 mmol/L h for 25 mg/kg b.i.d).
At the optimal dose of 75 mg/kg b.i.d., neither tumor growth
stimulation nor inhibition was observed in the HCT116 (Fig.
3B) or LoVo (Supplementary Fig. S2) CRC xenograft models
expressing BRAFWT. These observations, together with the
data generated in BRAFV600E-expressing xenograft models,
showed the in vivo BRAF mutation selectivity of vemurafenib.
Combination studies in the HT29 CRC xenograft model
Vemurafenib induces tumor regression at low doses in
melanoma xenograft models (25), consistent with the impressive clinical trial data in metastatic melanoma patients. The
modest clinical activity in CRC patients (19) suggests that

cellular survival, and concomitant inhibition of both pathways
is required to induce cell-cycle arrest and tumor cell death.
The synergistic effect of vemurafenib and AKTi was conﬁrmed in vivo (Fig. 2C). RKO xenografts were not sensitive to
the antitumor effect of vemurafenib monotherapy, shown by
minimal 25% TGI (P ¼ 0.046), when administered at an
optimized dose and schedule: 75 mg/kg, twice daily. Monotherapy of AKTi, when dosed at 120 mg/kg 3 times a week,
resulted in modest activity, only 37% TGI (P ¼ 0.014). However,
using these same doses, combination treatment with vemurafenib and AKTi achieved substantially greater TGI (87%; P <
0.001) than either agent alone, suggesting that AKTi sensitized
RKO CRC xenograft tumors to the antitumor effect of vemurafenib (Fig. 2C). This evidence suggested that in CRC tumor
cells harboring both oncogenic BRAF and mutated PIK3CA
genes, combination of vemurafenib and an inhibitor of PI3K
signaling would provide effective and sustained antitumor
effects, and an associated survival beneﬁt.

single-agent activity of vemurafenib is insufﬁcient to provide
sustained antitumor efﬁcacy. We therefore explored regimens
combining vemurafenib with some of the current standard-ofcare agents for CRC.
Vemurafenib/capecitabine/bevacizumab
Monotherapy, doublet, and triplet combination studies
of vemurafenib, capecitabine, and bevacizumab were conducted. Two capecitabine regimens were assessed: 14 days
on, 7 days off at 267 mg/kg (VCB14, Fig. 4A) and 7 days on,
7 days off at 467 mg/kg (VCB7, Fig. 4A). As monotherapy,
the antitumor activity of vemurafenib (TGI 77%; P < 0.05)
was superior (V versus C14, P < 0.05 and V versus B, P < 0.05)
to that of C14 (TGI 26%; P < 0.05 and 64%; P < 0.05),
respectively, but not C7 (TGI 76%; P < 0.05; Fig. 4B).

BRAF Inhibitor Vemurafenib in Preclinical Colorectal Cancer Models

Vemurafenib/erlotinib
The combination of vemurafenib with the small molecule
EGFR inhibitor erlotinib was also evaluated in the HT29 CRC
xenograft model. Combination of vemurafenib and erlotinib
resulted in increased antitumor activity (P < 0.05) and
survival (P < 0.0001) compared with monotherapy with
either agent (Fig. 6A and B, and Supplementary Table S4).
This combination was well tolerated at the optimal doses
of both agents. Speciﬁc EGFR inhibitor-related murine skin
rash was commonly observed with erlotinib, although it was
self-limiting even under continuous treatment as previously
described (43).

when adding vemurafenib to current standards of care for CRC
treatment.

Discussion

80
Percent survival

Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are found in a variety of
human cancers and BRAF-targeted therapies such as vemurafenib represent a potentially useful strategy for combating
these cancers.
In this study, antiproliferative and antitumor activity of
vemurafenib was observed in most of the BRAFV600E-bearing
CRC cell lines tested and in the HT29 BRAFV600E-expressing
CRC xenograft model, suggesting that BRAFV600E is a viable
therapeutic target in CRC. However, the modest efﬁcacy
observed during clinical evaluation of single-agent vemurafenib indicates that combination therapies are warranted to
induce and maintain durable remissions in BRAF-mutant
mCRC. At the molecular level, it is proposed that alternative
cell signaling and survival pathways may mitigate the impact
of BRAF-targeted therapy. RKO is a BRAFV600E-bearing CRC
cell line which also harbors a hot-spot mutation (H1047R) in
the PIK3CA gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the
PI3K–AKT signaling pathway (38, 39), and exhibits de novo
resistance to vemurafenib. Although RKO cells did not
respond to the antiproliferative effect of vemurafenib, inhibition of MAPK pathway, as measured by reductions in
phosphorylated MEK and ERK, was observed with vemurafenib treatment. Therefore, it was hypothesized that aberrant
PI3K pathway signaling might represent one mechanism
conferring resistance to vemurafenib, and that combination
therapy with a kinase inhibitor targeting PI3K or AKT may
deliver enhanced and sustained efﬁcacy. The results shown
here for the combination of vemurafenib with the AKT
inhibitor MK-2206 conﬁrms that blockade of both pathways
is important to induce cellular apoptosis, leading to antitu-

that although the combination effect of the AKTi and vemurafenib was markedly better than that observed for either

provide a strong preclinical rationale for testing for this
combination in clinical studies of patients with BRAF-mutant
CRC tumors that also show deregulated PI3K signaling.
Our experiments show that many BRAF-mutant CRCs are
sensitive to vemurafenib. The clinical activity of vemurafenib
in mCRC patients (albeit modest) supports BRAFV600E as a
therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease and suggests that in BRAF-mutant tumors that are known to carry a
worse prognosis than wild-type counterparts, vemurafenib
may contribute to improved outcomes. Clinical studies for all
previous therapies have shown that mCRC requires a multiagent approach to achieve sustained efﬁcacy, and the singleagent data suggest that a similar approach is warranted
for durable vemurafenib efﬁcacy. Therefore, we extensively
studied the ability of vemurafenib to potentiate in vivo efﬁcacy
of standard-of-care mCRC agents, such as capecitabine, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan, to select the most effective combination partners for clinical study. In BRAFV600E
xenograft models, although vemurafenib monotherapy was
shown to be superior to that of capecitabine or bevacizumab,
greater efﬁcacy was achieved with combination therapy.
Among these 3 agents, the doublet with the greatest antitumor
activity and maximum survival effect was vemurafenib plus
capecitabine, and even greater overall beneﬁt was observed
with triplet therapy.
Previous studies suggested that BRAF mutation may be
associated with EGFR treatment resistance (9, 11, 44, 45) and,
in light of our ﬁndings, it is speculated that vemurafenib
treatment may potentiate the antitumor effect of EGFR inhibitors on BRAFV600E-bearing tumors, resulting in increased

efﬁcacy, as observed here, with vemurafenib plus cetuximab
and erlotinib.
In conclusion, our studies show that rational addition of
vemurafenib to either targeted kinase inhibitors or to standard
therapies in BRAFV600E-bearing CRC resulted in increased
antitumor activity and efﬁcacy. We therefore speculate that
the true potential of vemurafenib in the treatment of BRAFmutant mCRC lies in combination with other agents, and these
data deﬁne potential combination strategies warranting clinical validation, to improve outcome in this refractory subset of
patients.
