BACKGROUND: Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) resistant to both imatinib and sunitinib have a
poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. In this study, the efficacy and safety of nilotinib (AMN107) as a third-line
therapy for patients with GISTs was evaluated. METHODS: A single-arm, open-label trial was conducted in 8 Japanese
hospitals. The key eligibility criteria included resistance or intolerance to both imatinib and sunitinib treatment. The
primary endpoint was disease control rate, defined as the percentage of patients with complete response, partial
response (PR), or stable disease (SD) lasting 24 weeks or longer. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled and
treated with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, which generally was well tolerated. Disease control rate at Week 24 was
29% (90% confidence interval, 16.4%-43.6%). The median progression-free survival was 113 days, and the median overall survival was 310 days. The objective response rate was 3%, comprising 1 PR in a patient with a GIST possessing
both a KIT exon 11 mutation, and an imatinib-resistant and sunitinib-resistant KIT exon 17 mutation. Twenty-three
(66%) patients had SD (6 weeks) as the best response. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nilotinib is generally well tolerated and has encouraging antitumor activity in patients with GIST who failed both imatinib and sunitiC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal

tract. Approximately 85% of GISTs contain an activating mutation in the proto-oncogene KIT,1,2 whereas an additional
3% to 5% of these tumors have a mutation in platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA).2,3
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is approved for the treatment of patients with inoperable and/or
metastatic KITþ GISTs.4 Despite the clinical activity of imatinib, most imatinib-treated patients eventually progress as a
result of secondary mutations in target kinases. In addition, a small percentage of patients are intolerant to imatinib or
show primary resistance to the drug.4-7 Sunitinib is the second-line treatment upon progression or intolerance to imatinib,
and it provides disease control for a median of 6 months, although this drug has been associated with some potentially serious adverse events (AEs).8
Patients with GIST who show progression of disease while taking imatinib and sunitinib have no therapeutic alternatives and a poor prognosis. Therefore, there remains an important unmet medical need in the treatment of these patients.

Original Article

Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown antiproliferative activity against
certain imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST
cell lines.9-11 In addition, nilotinib is subject to different
mechanisms of intracellular transportation than imatinib,
resulting in 7-fold to 10-fold higher intracellular concentration levels of nilotinib than imatinib.12-15
Clinical studies have shown that nilotinib provides
clinical benefit and demonstrates an acceptable toxicity
profile in patients with GISTs. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, 400 mg twice daily nilotinib was well tolerated
in patients with imatinib-resistant GIST.16 Furthermore,
in a compassionate use program, clinical activity was seen
in patients with GIST who had progressed on both imatinib and sunitinib.17
In this paper, we report the results of a phase 2 study
that was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of
nilotinib as a third-line therapy for patients with metastatic or locally advanced GIST.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible if they had confirmed unresectable
or metastatic GISTs and showed progression of disease
and/or demonstrated intolerance while taking imatinib
and sunitinib. Progression of disease required documentation during imatinib therapy of 400 mg/d or during sunitinib therapy that included at least 1 cycle of sunitinib
37.5 or 50 mg/d. Patients were also required to have normal organ function, electrolyte levels, and bone marrow
function. Patients were considered intolerant to imatinib or
sunitinib if they had discontinued therapy because of any
grade 3 AEs that could not be managed by appropriate
supportive care or other medical intervention, or persisted
after appropriate dose reduction. Patients were also considered intolerant to the drugs if they had any grade 2 AEs
that persisted for 1 month despite dose interruption and
optimal supportive care, or that recurred >3 whether
dose was reduced or discontinued. The key exclusion criteria were: prior treatment with any targeted drugs, with the
exception of imatinib and sunitinib; impaired cardiac function, including left ventricular ejection fraction <45% or
below the institutional lower limit of range; and a corrected
QT interval >450 milliseconds by central reading.
This study was conducted in accordance with the
International Conference on Harmonization’s Good
Clinical Practice and the World Medical Association’s
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol of this study was

4634

approved by the institutional review board for each study
site. Informed consent was obtained from each patient in
writing before the start of screening evaluation.
Study Design
This study was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter,
phase 2 clinical study. All patients were treated with nilotinib, given orally, 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was disease control rate at Week 24, defined as the
proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or
stable disease (SD) 24 weeks from the start of nilotinib
treatment. The secondary endpoints were disease control
rate at Week 24 in patients with sunitinib-resistant
GISTs, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
(OS), objective response rate, safety of nilotinib, and
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nilotinib. In addition,
the relation of tumor characteristics (KIT and PDGFRA
mutations) determined from tumor tissue samples with
clinical outcome was described.
Tumor imaging was performed at baseline and on
Day 28, Day 56, and every 8 weeks afterward. Measurement of efficacy regarding tumor assessments was based
on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RESIST). Third-party, central radiological reviewers
assessed all images from computed tomography/magnetic
resonance imaging. For patients who were unable to tolerate daily dosing of 800 mg because of drug-related toxicity, certain dose reductions were permitted. Patients
permanently discontinued treatment if a treatment interruption was needed because of nilotinib-related toxicity
and treatment could not be resumed within 21 days.
Serial blood sampling for PK assessment was performed in selected patients on Days 1 (n ¼ 9) and 8 (n ¼
8) as follows: 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12 hours
postdose. Serum concentrations of nilotinib were
determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry. PK parameters were calculated by a noncompartmental method using WinNonlin Professional
version 5.2 (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, Calif).
Paraffin-embedded specimens were collected from a
majority of patients (n ¼ 31) before imatinib and sunitinib treatment and were used to detect KIT and PDGFRA
mutations by direct sequencing. Specimens were collected
from 2 patients after imatinib treatment.
Statistical Analysis
All patients who received at least 1 dose of nilotinib (ie,
full analysis set) also received at least 1 safety assessment

after drug administration. All tumor responses assessed by
the independent central radiological review were used in
the efficacy analyses; responses based on the investigators’
assessments were not analyzed. The primary endpoint of
this study, disease control rate at Week 24, was estimated
with a corresponding 90% exact confidence interval (CI).
PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Analysis of the frequency of adverse events and
laboratory abnormalities was performed on the full analysis set. The minimum required sample size of 32 patients
was calculated based on the CI approach for the primary
efficacy endpoint, where the expected disease control rate
at Week 24 was assumed to be 15%. On the basis of an
assumed precision of 10% (ie, the lower CI limit), a 5%
disease control rate minimum efficacy bound would be
expected. As a result, 35 patients were exposed to the
study drug.
This report presents the results from the main data
analysis time point, which was the time when all patients
completed the Week 24 visit or discontinued early. The
cutoff date for this analysis was October 2, 2009.

RESULTS
Patient Population
Of the 40 patients who were screened, 35 were enrolled in
8 sites in Japan between September 2008 and April 2009.
All 35 patients received at least 1 dose of nilotinib and
were included in the full analysis set.
Patients’ characteristics for the full analysis set are
shown in Table 1. Twenty-eight (80%) patients were
resistant to sunitinib, and the remaining 7 (20%) patients
were sunitinib intolerant. Twenty-two (63%) patients had
experienced only 1 prior regimen of imatinib therapy followed by 1 regimen of sunitinib therapy and can be considered true third-line. Ten (29%) patients had been retreated
with imatinib after sunitinib therapy. The median time
since first diagnosis was 59.1 months (5 years). The most
common primary GIST genotype was KIT exon 11 mutant
(n ¼ 17, 49%) followed by KIT exon 9 mutant (n ¼ 5,
14%). One (3%) patient possessed a GIST harboring a
D842V mutation of PDGFRA exon 18.
At the time of data cutoff, the median time of exposure to nilotinib was 120 days (range, 7-319). Seven (20%)
patients were still taking the study treatment. Of the
remaining 28 (80%) patients, 3 (9% of total) discontinued
study treatment because of AEs, and 25 (71% of total) discontinued because of disease progression. The median

and the median relative dose intensity was 0.98.
Efficacy
Tumor response is summarized in Table 2. No CR was
achieved as of the data cutoff date. One patient achieved a
confirmed PR, resulting in a 3% objective response rate.
In addition, 9 (26%) patients demonstrated SD lasting
24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint, disease control rate at Week 24, was achieved by 29% (90% CI,
14.6%-46.3%) of the full analysis set, as well as 29% of
sunitinib-resistant patients (85% CI, 13.2-48.7; n ¼ 28).

rate at Week 24 by GIST primary genotype was: KIT
exon 11 mutation, 35% (6 of 17 patients); KIT exon 9
mutation, 20% (1 of 5 patients); PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, 0% (0 of 1 patient); wild type, 25% (1 of 4 patients);
and unknown, 25% (2 of 8 patients). The proportion of
patients who met the disease control rate at Week 24 by
GIST primary site was: stomach, 36% (4 of 11 patients);
small intestine, 29% (6 of 21 patients); other, 0% (0 of 2
patients); and unknown, 0% (0 of 1 patient). A higher
percentage of patients who received >24 months of prior
imatinib treatment met the disease control rate at Week
24 compared with those who did not (Table 3; 40% vs
13%, respectively). Conversely, a higher percentage of
patients treated with sunitinib for <6 weeks met the disease control rate at Week 24 compared with those patients
treated for >6 weeks (33% vs 18%, respectively).
Tissue specimens were collected from 2 patients
(who were both sunitinib resistant) after imatinib treatment, allowing for detection of possible secondary mutations. One of these patients, who harbored a GIST with
KIT mutations in exon 11 (dup 567-576) and in exon 17
(D820G), achieved a confirmed PR (Fig. 1). At Week 16,
there was a 37% decrease in the longest diameter of the
target lesion (Fig. 1B), and this PR was subsequently confirmed at Week 24. The other patient harbored a GIST
with KIT mutations in exon 11 (del 552-558) and exon
17 (N822K), and had SD lasting 24 weeks.

Twenty-three (66%) patients had SD (at least 1 SD

response. The best percentage change from baseline in the
sum of the longest diameters of target lesions is shown in
Figure 2. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was
observed in 40% of patients.
The median PFS was 113 days (3.7 months; 90%
Cl, 102-119 days) as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 3). Among 35 patients, 23 experienced tumor
progression before the data cutoff date, and the remaining
12 patients were censored because of continuing SD or
better, or for other reasons.

The median OS was 310 days. On the data cutoff
day, 14 deaths had been confirmed, and 21 patients were
censored; 20 patients were alive as of the cutoff date, and
1 patient refused follow-up for his survival information.
Safety
The most frequently reported AEs (patient incidence
20%, all grade), regardless of causality, are listed in Table
4. Most of these AEs were grade 1 or 2, as grade 3 or 4 AEs
were relatively infrequent, except for anemia. Grade 3 or 4

anemia was observed in 7 (20%) patients, all of whom had
grade 1 to 3 anemia at baseline. The most frequent AEs suspected to be related to the study drug included nausea,
vomiting, hyperbilirubinemia, and decreased appetite
(29% each). Newly occurring or worsening grade 3 or 4
laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 5. The only
grade 3 or 4 hematological abnormalities reported were for
abnormal hemoglobin and lymphocyte levels (Table 5).
Two patients had at least 1 absolute prolongation of
QT, or a corrected QT, of >480 milliseconds. In these
patients, corrected QT interval was >450 milliseconds,
and extension QT interval from baseline was >60 milliseconds. Neither patient had a significant prior history of
arrhythmias, abnormal electrolytes, or clinical sequelae.
No patients had corrected QT interval of >480 milliseconds. Neither torsades de pointes nor sudden death was
observed.
Sixteen (46%) patients required dose adjustment or
interruption because of AEs. Discontinuations of the treatment because of AEs were reported in 3 (9%) patients, and
1 (3%) of these patients discontinued because of an AE that
was suspected of being related to the drug treatment. Table
6 summarizes death and other serious AEs and AEs related
to discontinuation of the study drug. Two patients died
within 28 days after discontinuation of study treatment
because of disease progression (Table 6).
Pharmacokinetics
After oral administration of nilotinib, the median time to
peak serum concentration was 5 hours on Day 1 and 4

hours on Day 8 (Fig. 4, Table 7). With multiple dosing,
steady-state condition was achieved by Day 8. There was a
3-fold accumulation in serum levels of nilotinib between
the first-dose and steady-state with twice daily dosing.
When serum exposure of nilotinib was compared between
patients with and without total gastrectomy, the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the
curve (AUC0-12 hours) at steady state in 1 patient with total
gastrectomy (635 ng/mL and 5561 ng  h/mL, respectively)
were much lower than those in patients without total gastrectomy (Cmax, 2193  1051 ng/mL; AUC0-12 hours,
18,734  9551 ng  h/mL).

DISCUSSION
Patients with advanced GIST who are resistant to or intolerant of both imatinib and sunitinib have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. This phase 2 study
demonstrates that nilotinib is active in patients with
advanced GISTs who have previously failed both imatinib
and sunitinib treatment, as indicated by a disease control

rate of 29% at Week 24. Furthermore, although only 1
patient achieved a PR in our study by RECIST, a decrease
in target lesions was observed in 40% of patients. These
results suggest that the clinical activity of nilotinib may not
have been evaluated accurately by RECIST in our study,
and that achieving SD is a clinically relevant benefit.
Our study results corroborate findings reported by
other investigators. Retrospective analysis of data from a
compassionate use program demonstrated the clinical activity of nilotinib and its favorable tolerability profile in
heavily pretreated patients with imatinib-resistant and
sunitinib-resistant GISTs; nilotinib 400 mg twice daily
was well tolerated and provided clinical benefit in 51% of
patients.17 Furthermore, patients treated with nilotinib in
the compassionate use study had a median PFS of 12
weeks and a median OS of 34 weeks. In our phase 2 study
reported herein, patients had a median PFS of 16.1 weeks

and median OS of 44.3 weeks. The median PFS observed
for patients treated with nilotinib in both the compassionate use study (12 weeks) and our study (16.1 weeks) compare favorably to patients in the control arm of a phase 3
trial of patients with advanced GIST who were intolerant
or resistant to imatinib and were randomized to either
sunitinib or placebo (median PFS, 6 weeks; median OS,
36 weeks).8,18 Although direct comparisons between these
3 studies cannot be made, these collective findings (compassionate use study and our study vs sunitinib) nonetheless suggest that nilotinib has activity in some patients
who have failed on both imatinib and sunitinib.
The Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in
Clinical Trials (ENEST g3) study compared nilotinib
with best supportive care—which could include either
imatinib, sunitinib, or neither at the discretion of the investigator—for patients with advanced GISTs who had
failed at least 2 prior treatments. Results from this randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 3 trial were reported
recently.19 No statistically significant differences in PFS
(P ¼ .5555) or OS (P ¼ .29) were found between the nilotinib and control arms, as assessed by central radiological
review. However, interpretation of results from the ENEST
g3 study is limited, as the best supportive care patients of
the control arm were heterogeneously treated. However,
exploratory post hoc analysis indicated that nilotinib provided a 4-month improvement in median OS in true thirdline patients (median OS, 57.8 weeks nilotinib vs 40 weeks,
P ¼ .02; hazard ratio, 0.67). Similar to ENEST g3, patients
with >2 previous lines of therapy were included in our
study (n ¼ 13, 37%). As such, the clinical activity demonstrated for nilotinib in our study may have been higher if
the study were restricted to true third-line patients.
Secondary resistance to imatinib can develop through
various mechanisms, the most common being the emergence of secondary KIT mutations in clonally expanded
GIST cells.20-22 Sunitinib demonstrates activity against
some imatinib-resistant secondary KIT mutations, but not
all. Sunitinib potently inhibited the activity of KIT with

Cancer

mutations in exon 11 and KIT with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-binding domain of either exon 13 or
14, with 50% inhibitory concentration values of <100
nmol/L reported.23 However, KIT double mutants that
possess secondary mutations in the activation loop encoded
by exons 17 and 18 (eg, V560D þ D820G and V560D þ
D822K) are resistant to both imatinib and sunitinib.20
Results from this study suggest that nilotinib may be
active in patients with GIST who possess secondary activation loop KIT mutations in exons 17 and 18. Tissue
specimens from 2 patients were collected after imatinib
treatment, allowing for detection of possible secondary
mutations. One of these patients, who had a confirmed
PR in this study, harbored a GIST with KIT mutations in
exon 11 (dup 567-576) and exon 17 (D820G). The other
patient, who had SD lasting >24 weeks, harbored a GIST
with KIT mutations in exon 11 (del 552-558) and exon
17 (N822K). The clinical benefit observed in these 2
patients suggests that nilotinib might be effective in a
patient population not expected to respond to second-line
sunitinib treatment, that is, patients with secondary KIT
exon 17 and 18 mutations. In support of this, nilotinib
and imatinib interact differentially with homologous activation loop residues of the ABL kinase.24 A similar differential interaction with KIT activation loop residues may
account for the differential sensitivity of these tyrosine
kinase inhibitors to KIT exon 17 and 18 mutations.
Although it has been reported that the activity of nilotinib
against N822K mutant KIT in transfected murine Ba/F3
cells (concentration that inhibits 50% [IC50], 3083 nM) is
not substantially greater than that of imatinib (IC50,
>10,000 nM),25 this difference might be greater in cells
bearing the deletion 552-558, N822K double mutant.
Alternatively, the intracellular milieu of transfected Ba/F3
cells, in which nonphysiological levels of KIT are overexpressed, may not be representative of GIST cells; differences
in the activity of nilotinib and imatinib toward N822K mutant KIT may only be observed in the context of target cells.
Duration of prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment may offer prognostic value, or alternatively, influence response to nilotinib. A higher proportion of
patients treated with imatinib for >24 weeks compared
with <24 weeks, or treated with sunitinib for <6 weeks
compared with >6 weeks, achieved disease control at
Week 24 while receiving nilotinib treatment (Table 3).
Additional data on histopathological factors such as the
relative responsiveness of different molecular subgroups
of imatinib-resistant GISTs may help to optimize treatment of patients with progressive disease and may help

clinicians to better understand the basis of tyrosine kinase
inhibitor activity in imatinib-resistant patients.
When PK parameters were compared between
patients with and without total gastrectomy, a decrease in
oral bioavailability of nilotinib as a result of total gastrectomy was suggested. One of the reasons for the lowered
bioavailability may be decreased solubility of nilotinib in
the gastrointestinal tract, presumably as a consequence of
shorter gastrointestinal retention of nilotinib, impaired
bile excretion, or both.26 Because of the limited number
of patients in this subanalysis, the influence of the
decreased bioavailability on clinical outcome of nilotinib
is difficult to ascertain.
Our findings indicated that, in general, treatment
with nilotinib was well tolerated. A higher percentage of
patients in this study were intolerant to sunitinib (n ¼ 7,
20%) than to nilotinib (n ¼ 3, 8.6%) or imatinib (n ¼ 3,
8.6%). The most common treatment-related adverse events
were nausea, vomiting, anemia, decreased appetite, and
hyperbilirubinemia. Severe toxicities (grade 3 or 4) that
occurred in 10% of patients included anemia and hyperglycemia. Patients with GISTs commonly experience anemia, which may occur because of several etiologies not
directly related to drug treatment.27 Consistent with this, all
patients who experienced grade 3 or 4 anemia (n ¼ 7, 20%)
had grade 1 to 3 anemia at baseline. Moreover, the presence
of anemia may have contributed to the occurrences of
fatigue observed in this study (n ¼ 12, 34%; any grade).27
The toxicity profiles observed in this study are similar to those reported for nilotinib second-line treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the major
nonhematological toxicities were rash, skin toxicities,
headache, nausea, and fatigue.28,29 However, hematological toxicity was less frequent in this study compared with
nilotinib-treated patients with CML. Toxicities encountered in this study were manageable using dose modification, supportive treatment, or both.
In conclusion, nilotinib was generally well tolerated
and demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in
patients with advanced GISTs who failed on imatinib and
sunitinib therapies. Although this was a small, single-arm
study, further testing of nilotinib as third-line treatment
for GISTs is warranted, as limited therapeutic options are
available for this patient population.
