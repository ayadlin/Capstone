SUMMARY
Combined BRAF and MEK targeted therapy improves upon BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy but
is still beset by acquired resistance. We show that melanomas acquire resistance to combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition by augmenting or combining mechanisms of single-agent BRAFi
resistance. These double-drug resistance-associated genetic configurations significantly altered
molecular interactions underlying MAPK pathway reactivation. V600EBRAF, expressed at supraphysiological levels because of V600EBRAF ultra-amplification, dimerized with and activated
CRAF. In addition, MEK mutants enhanced interaction with over-expressed V600EBRAF via a
regulatory interface at R662 of V600EBRAF. Importantly, melanoma cell lines selected for
resistance to BRAFi+MEKi, but not those to BRAFi alone, displayed robust drug addiction,
providing a potentially exploitable therapeutic opportunity.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RAS and BRAF are frequently mutated in human malignancies. In advanced melanoma,
NRAS and, less often, KRAS mutations occur in ~20% of cases and are mutually exclusively
with BRAF mutations, which are present in ~50% of cases. Somatic MEK1 or MEK2
mutations, which can be concurrent with RAS or BRAF mutations, have also been detected
(Hodis et al., 2012; Krauthammer et al., 2012; Nikolaev et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012a), but
their roles in pathogenesis and therapeutic responses remain ill-defined. BRAF mutations
strongly predict responses to ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) such as
vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Allosteric MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors (MEKi), such as
trametinib, selumetinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib, may have anti-tumor activities against
a broader melanoma segment, including those with NRAS mutations or with both WT NRAS
and WT BRAF, but MEKi monotherapy for patients with BRAF mutant melanomas is
associated with a narrower therapeutic window (vs. BRAFi) (Ribas and Flaherty, 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Melanoma re-growth after initial response to MEKi has been attributed to a P124LMEK1
mutation (Emery et al., 2009) and acquired MEKi resistance in BRAF mutant colorectal cell
lines has been linked to a F129LMEK1 mutation (Wang et al., 2011) or BRAF amplification
(Corcoran et al., 2010). How these MEK mutations mechanistically account for MEKi
resistance is not entirely clear. Due to the superior clinical benefits of BRAFi for melanoma
patients, mechanisms of acquired BRAFi resistance have been studied extensively, and those
well-validated clinically include NRAS or KRAS mutations (Nazarian et al., 2010; Shi et al.,
2014), V600EBRAF amplification (Shi et al., 2012b) or alternative splicing (Poulikakos et al.,
2011; Shi et al., 2012a), MEK1 or MEK2 mutations (Shi et al., 2012a; Wagle et al., 2011),
CDKN2A loss (Shi et al., 2014), and genetic alterations in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway
(Shi et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014). The convergence of multiple mechanisms to
reactivate the MAPK pathway provided a strong rationale for combined BRAF and MEK
targeting to overcome BRAFi resistance, a strategy that is supplanting single-agent BRAFi
therapy. However, acquired resistance to BRAFi+MEKi still limits the long-term survival of

patients with advanced V600E/KBRAF melanoma. A priori, the intransigence of acquired
resistance in response to dual MAPK targeting may be due to preferential emergence of
MAPK-redundant resistance pathways. Evidence of branched evolution, extensive interpatient/tumor heterogeneity, and increased tumor fitness as melanoma emerges from
BRAFi-imposed evolutionary selection may help explain why the BRAFi+MEKi
combinatorial approach is also an “uphill battle” (Shi et al., 2014).
In this study, we investigate the genetic mechanisms of acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance
and elucidate their signaling consequences and therapeutic implications.

RESULTS
Genetic alterations underlying acquired resistance to BRAF/MEK co-targeting in
melanoma

We assembled melanoma tissues with acquired resistance to BRAFi+MEKi (abbreviated as
double-drug disease progression or DD-DP) (n=28 DD-DP tumors, each with patientmatched baseline tumors) from patients (n=15) treated under two distinct clinical scenarios
(Figure 1A): 1) upfront BRAFi+MEKi (dabrafenib+trametinib or vemurafenib+cobimetinib)
in patients (n=10) who were naïve to treatment with either BRAFi or MEKi, and 2) BRAFi
+MEKi (vemurafenib+cobimetinib) in patients (n=5) who had previously responded to but
progressed on BRAFi (vemurafenib) alone (Table S1). We then analyzed known
mechanisms of acquired BRAFi resistance in the MAPK pathway by sequencing the most
pertinent exons of BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, MEK1 and MEK2 and performing BRAF copy
number analysis (Table S2). Sixteen of 28 DD-DP tumors, along with their patient-matched
baseline tumors and normal tissues (n=7), were whole exome-sequenced and analyzed for
MAPK and PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway alterations as reported earlier (Shi et al., 2014)
(Table S2). In 19 of 28 (68%) DD-DP tumors, we detected known mechanisms of acquired
BRAFi resistance in the two core resistance pathways. These included eight DD-DP tumors
harboring V600EBRAF amplification, four harboring NRAS activating mutations, one
harboring a KRAS activating mutation, eight harboring CDKN2A deletions, three harboring
PTEN loss-of-function (LOF) mutation (a substitution resulting in F127V; Figure S1) or
deletions, and one harboring a PIK3R1 deletion. In contrast to the same alterations detected
in the context of resistance to BRAFi monotherapy (Shi et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014),
those associated with acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance were notable for augmented gene
dosage changes, e.g. V600EBRAF ultra-amplification with 74 or 88 copies (Figure 1B, Table
S2), LOF F127VPTEN mutation or homozygous PTEN deletions (Figure 1C), G12RNRAS
with selective mutant allele amplification (Figure 1D and 1E), and homozygous CDKN2A
deletions (Table S2). There were examples suggesting combinatorial mechanisms, e.g.,
concurrent heterozygous Q61KNRAS with homozygous CDKN2A deletion and LOF PTEN
mutation; V600EBRAF amplification concurrent with homozygous CDKN2A deletion or
hemizygous DUSP4 deletion (with related V600EBRAF up-expression and DUSP4 downexpression, Figures 1F to H); and homozygous CDKN2A deletion concurrent with
homozygous PTEN deletion and hemizygous PIK3R1 deletion. Thus, genetic analysis of
melanomas progressing on BRAFi+MEKi revealed a prevalence of mechanisms of acquired

BRAFi resistance, but these genetic alterations often occurred in greater magnitudes or in
combinations.

BRAFi-resistant melanoma rapidly up-regulates resistance mechanisms individually or
combinatorially to overcome BRAF/MEK inhibitors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further understand acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance in melanoma underlying the two
aforementioned clinical contexts, we generated isogenic human V600EBRAF melanoma cell
lines using treatment regimens mimicking each clinical context. In the sequential resistance
model, we took those isogenic sub-lines with acquired BRAFi (vemurafenib) resistance
(Single-Drug Resistance or SDR), via clinically validated mechanisms such as NRAS
mutation (M249R4) (Nazarian et al., 2010), V600EBRAF alternative splicing (M397R) (Shi
et al., 2012b) or amplification (M395R) (Shi et al., 2012b), and generated further sub-lines
with BRAFi+MEKi (vemurafenib+selumetinib) or Double-Drug Resistance (DDR). In the
upfront BRAFi+MEKi resistance model, we took the same set of parental (P), drug-naïve
melanoma cell lines and treated them at the outset with BRAFi+MEKi until we generated
sub-lines with DDR (Figure 2A). The cell subpopulations were exposed to similar
increments of inhibitor concentrations, with the duration at each inhibitor concentration
dictated by successful population doubling within 3–4 days. When the time-cumulative
doses to reach the full DDR phenotype (defined as 2 μM of BRAFi+MEKi) were compared
between these two models, it was clear that the development of DDR from SDR was much
faster than DDR directly from parental lines (Figure 2A). This observation is consistent with
the hypothesis that preexisting mechanisms of BRAFi resistance could be readily augmented
or tuned up to confer resistance to BRAFi+MEKi.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess this hypothesis, we examined the SDR vs. SDR-DDR isogenic pairs of cell lines
for alterations in the preexisting, defined mechanisms of BRAFi resistance (Figure 2B–E).
We showed that the M397 SDR->DDR progression was associated with a dramatically
upregulated level of alternatively spliced V600EBRAF mRNA (Figure 2B). Moreover, the
M395 SDR->DDR progression resulted in further V600EBRAF amplification along with
RNA up-expression. The M249 SDR->DDR progression upregulated mutant NRAS mRNA
levels without gDNA copy number gain (Figure 2C–D). Accordingly, at the protein
expression level (Figure 2E), M249 SDR-DDR expressed an increased NRAS level; M397
SDR-DDR upregulated the level of a truncated p61 V600EBRAF; and M395 SDR-DDR
upregulated V600EBRAF expression further (all relative to isogenic SDR sub-lines).
Moreover, full-length V600EBRAF over-expression (in M395 SDR or SDR-DDR) was
associated with extensive p-CRAF levels (vs. their parental line). Thus, common
mechanisms of acquired BRAFi resistance are highly tunable, by either genetic or nongenetic means, and augmentation or combination of such molecular alterations readily
confers resistance to BRAFi+MEKi.
We then tested whether specific examples of gene dosage augmentation or concurrent
genetic alterations from the exomic analysis of paired melanoma tissues would augment
BRAFi+MEKi resistance in cell line models. Parallel to the mutant NRAS amplifications
detected in both DD-DPs of patient #9 (Figures 1D–E), M249 SDR-DDR up-expressed
mutant NRAS (albeit via a non-mutational mechanism) (vs. P or SDR) (Figures 2A, 2C–E).

NRAS knockdown (Figure 2F) restored BRAFi sensitivity to M249 SDR, as would be
expected, but it also strongly restored BRAFi+MEKi sensitivity to M249 SDR-DDR in both
short- and long-term (Figure 2G–H) survival assays, indicating that over-expression of
mutant NRAS drove DDR. To engineer a DDR cell line mimicking Q61KNRAS
heterozygosity+F271VPTEN/K197*PTEN compound heterozygous mutations (DD-DP of
patient #6; Figure 1C), we took advantage of the PTEN-expressing, Q61KNRAS-driven M238
SDR sub-line (Figure 2I), which was derived from its V600EBRAF parental line by
incremental exposures to increasing doses of BRAFi, and stably introduced shPTEN. We
showed that PTEN knockdown in M239 SDR increased the p-AKT level (Figure 2J) and
resistance to BRAFi+MEKi (Figure 2K), indicating that each resistance mechanism
(Q61KNRAS and PTEN loss) quantitatively contributed to DDR. Moreover, given
that V600EBRAF amplification concurred with hemizygous DUSP4 deletion (DD-DP1, 2 of
patient #11), we tested whether DUSP4 knockdown (Figure 2L) could confer double-drug
resistance to the M395 SDR sub-line, which acquired BRAFi resistance via V600EBRAF
amplification. As seen in Figure 2M, M395 SDR was moderately cross-resistant to BRAFi
+MEKi treatments, but loss of DUSP4 expression augmented DDR.

Clonal analysis detects alternative genetic configurations in BRAFi+MEKi resistance
associated with MAPK reactivation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous results indicate that, once sub-clones with specific BRAFi resistance mechanisms
have attained clonal dominance, overcoming BRAFi resistance with the added MEKi is at
best an “uphill battle.” We then sought to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of
resistance to upfront BRAFi+MEKi (vemurafenib+selumetinib). A polyclonal DDR sub-line
derived from M249 harbored both mutant BRAF ultra-amplification and a MEK1 mutation
(F129L) (data not shown). F129LMEK1 had previously been uncovered in a colorectal subline bred to acquire selumetinib resistance (Wang et al., 2011). To understand the individual
contributions of V600EBRAF amplification and MEK1 mutation to the DDR phenotype, we
re-treated the M249 P with increments of BRAFi+MEKi but derived two single cell-derived
M249 DDR sub-clones, DDR4 and DDR5. In contrast to M249 P, both DDR4 and DDR5
were highly resistant to the growth-inhibitory effect of BRAFi+MEKi in 3-day MTT assays
(Figure 3A). In fact, the apparent “growth-stimulation” of DDR4 and DDR5 by BRAFi
+MEKi treatment was due to a relative loss of their viability in the absence of optimal
concentrations of the inhibitors. This “drug addiction” phenomenon was even more
profound in long-term clonogenic assays (see Figure 4). SCH772984, an ERKi and an
analog of which is being tested clinically, was inefficient to inhibit the growth of DDR4 or
DDR5 by itself but was highly active against M249 P (Figure 3A). In fact, low
concentrations of SCH772984 rescued DDR4 and DDR5 from drug addiction, suggesting
that sub-optimal ERKi dosing to overcome DDR may paradoxically perpetuate DDR fitness.
In contrast, ERKi restored BRAFi+MEKi sensitivity to DDR4 and DDR5, consistent with
MAPK pathway reactivation as the major mechanism of acquired resistance to upfront
BRAFi+MEKi. This was corroborated by analyzing the MAPK pathway status (pERK
levels) in the M249 triplet (Figure 3B). After plating for 16 hr without both inhibitors, the
triplet cell lines were treated with BRAFi+MEKi (1 hr) at increasing concentrations (Figure
3B) or with BRAFi+MEKi (1 μM) for increasing durations (up to 72 hr) (Figure S2A).
Western blot analysis showed that DDR4 and DDR5, compared to M249 P, displayed higher

baseline and inhibitor-treated p-ERK levels as well as faster p-ERK recovery in the
continued presence of BRAFi+MEKi. Monitoring further upstream for p-MEK and
downstream for p-RSK (Thr573) levels revealed a similarly rapid recovery of the MAPK
pathway (Figure S2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Consistent with the BRAF protein levels (Figure 3B), we found that DDR4
harbored V600EBRAF ultra-amplification (47.4 fold or >160 copies), while DDR5 harbored
low copy-number V600EBRAF gain (4.6 fold or 20 copies) along with F129LMEK1 (Figures
3C and 3D). V600EBRAF copy number gains quantified by gDNA Q-PCR were corroborated
by Sanger sequencing, which showed a BRAF mutant to WT ratio of 2:1 in the parental line
(or about 3 BRAF copies) and apparent V600EBRAF homozygosity in DDR4 and DDR5
resulting from selective V600EBRAF amplification (Figure 3D). Moreover, whole exome
sequence (WES) analysis of the M249 triplet cell lines confirmed that the DDR-associated
altered mutant/variant allelic frequencies (MAFs) of V600EBRAF and F129LMEK1 (Figure
3E) were likely due to mutant allele-selective copy number gains (Figure 3F). WES analysis
also detected a low F129LMEK1 MAF (4%) in the parental polyclonal line, suggesting
preexistence of this drug-resistant sub-clone (Figure 3E). In addition, copy number variation
(CNV) analysis revealed distinct BRAF amplicons in M249 DDR4 vs. DDR5, suggesting
convergent evolution (Figure 3F, top). Since the concurrence of V600EBRAF amplification
and F129LMEK1 in M249 DDR5 could be selected by distinct inhibitor concentrations, we
derived two additional M249 DDR sub-lines (M249 DDR2 and M249 DDR3) by treatments
from the outset with a higher concentration of BRAFi+MEKi (0.5 μM). In a pattern
suggestive of convergent evolution, both M249 DDR2 and DDR3 displayed low-copy
number gains of both V600EBRAF and F129LMEK1 (Figures S2C–E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using a WTBRAF cell line, human 293T, we then tested the impact of MEK mutants
associated with MAPKi resistance on cellular substrate levels (i.e., pERK) and the p-ERK
IC50 of MEKi (Figures S2F–G). We over-expressed F129LMEK1, C121SMEK1 (which
confers BRAFi resistance) (Wagle et al., 2011) and several MEK mutants
(Q56PMEK1, K59delMEK1, and E203KMEK1) associated with clinical resistance to MAPK
targeting and compared their impacts on baseline pERK levels as well as the sensitivities of
p-ERK to MEKi (selumetinib). Although over-expression of these MEK1 mutants
(vs. WTMEK1) variably increased the baseline p-ERK level, their cellular p-ERK IC50 to
MEKi did not differ appreciably, arguing against allosteric MEKi binding defect as the
shared mechanism of action of MEK mutants. Their concurrence with V600EBRAF
amplification argues for a possible cooperative biochemical mechanism of resistance.
To further understand the impact of ERKi on survival of DDR4 and DDR5 cells (Figure
3A), we withdrew DDR4 and DDR5 (16 hr off) from BRAFi+MEKi and then treated them
with either ERKi (1 hr) alone or BRAFi+MEKi+ERKi (1 hr) (Figure 3G). ERKi alone was
ineffective at suppressing the p-ERK rebound following double-drug withdrawal (Figure
3G). However, once BRAFi+MEKi were re-introduced, additional treatment with ERKi was
highly effective in suppressing the p-ERK levels (Figure 3G). Thus, ERKi treatment alone
of some melanoma cells previously selected for resistance by BRAFi+MEKi would be
ineffective unless very high ERKi doses were delivered, which is unlikely achievable
clinically. Thus, clonal M249 DDR4 and DDR5 melanoma sub-lines harbor salient but

Earlier, we noted a robust upregulation of p-CRAF in the M395 SDR and SDR-DDR sublines that harbor V600EBRAF amplification (Figure 2E). Hence, we probed the p-CRAF
levels in the M249 triplet lines. DDR4 and DDR5, freshly treated with BRAFi+MEKi (1 h),
displayed robust elevated p-CRAF levels (DDR4 > DDR5 ≫ P; Figure 3H). Up-regulated
p-CRAF levels in DDR4 and DDR5 did not require the continued presence of both
inhibitors, as their withdrawal for up to 20 hours after an overnight (16 hr) treatment did not
diminish the p-CRAF levels (Figure S2H). We hypothesized that this strong CRAF upregulation in DDR4 (and a weaker one in DDR5) may be driven by supraphysiologic V600EBRAF over-expression, the degree of which positively correlated with that
of p-CRAF up-regulation (Figures 3B, 3H and 4A). To test this hypothesis, we knocked
down BRAF levels in DDR4 and DDR5, with or without BRAFi+MEKi, and found that
BRAF knockdown effectively down-regulated p-CRAF levels (Figure 4A). BRAF
knockdown also reduced p-CRAF levels in the V600EBRAF-amplified M395 SDR-DDR subline (Figure 2B; Figure S3A). We also knocked down CRAF directly (Figure 4B) and tested
the individual contributions of BRAF vs. CRAF to the clonogenic (i.e., long-term) growth/
survival of the M249 triplet (Figure 4C). As expected, M249 P growth/survival was not
sensitive to CRAF knockdown but highly sensitive to BRAF knockdown. Consistent with
prior short-term assays (Figure 3A), both M249 DDR4 and DDR5 displayed dramatic “drug
addiction.” Importantly, in the presence of both inhibitors, the growth/survival of DDR4 and
DDR5 was highly dependent on either CRAF or BRAF, suggesting functional and physical
interaction.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess whether there are likely additional genetic underpinnings of p-CRAF upregulation
(and DDR) in DDR4 and DDR5, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of the M249
triplet (Figure 4D) and assessed the genetic alterations shared by DDR4 and DDR5 (Table
S3). From this WES-based phylogeny, it was apparent that DDR4 and DDR5 single-cell
clones represent minor sub-clones in the parental, polyclonal population, since they each
harbors a large number of private mutations, which escaped detection in the mixed parental
population. In fact, the number of shared genetic alterations between DDR4 and DDR5 was
exceedingly small (Table S3), suggesting that these few alterations (aside from V600EBRAF
amplification) were unlikely drivers of DDR. As the M249 P majority population does not
harbor the DDR4 or DDR5-private mutations, we reasoned that the ability of salient genetic
feature shared by DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 (V600EBRAF amplification) and by
DDR2, DDR3, and DDR5 (F129LMEK1 and its low copy number gain) to reconstitute DDR
(and their biochemical features) would establish sufficiency (in light of necessity established
earlier).
We then directly tested whether supra-physiologic V600EBRAF over-expression, mimicking
the DDR4 and DDR5 levels, would be sufficient to up-regulate p-CRAF levels. We
engineered the M249 P to express stably and homogeneously the empty vector, F129LMEK1

(Figure 4E) or Q56PMEK1 (Figure 4F) (identified in clinical MEKi (Villanueva et al., 2013)
or BRAFi+MEKi (Wagle et al., 2014) resistance), V600EBRAF high over-expression,
and V600EBRAF low over-expression concurrent with a MEK1 mutation. Regardless of
double-drug treatment (16 hr) or subsequent withdrawal (8 hr), V600EBRAF high overexpression induced a robust DDR4-like p-CRAF level, while V600EBRAF low overexpression concurrent with a MEK1 mutation induced a lower, DDR5-like p-CRAF level.
Neither vector control nor MUTMEK1 alone had any impact on the p-CRAF level. Also,
supra-physiologic expression of WTBRAF or V600E/R509HBRAF (known to disrupt BRAFCRAF dimerization) in M249 P only marginally up-regulated p-CRAF (Figure 4G).
However, the M249 P engineered cell lines (vs. the spontaneously resistant DDR4 and
DDR5 sub-lines), displayed a slower pERK recovery (with or without BRAFi+MEKi;
Figures 4E–F). This difference (a few hours) was minimal compared to the extremely slow
p-ERK recovery observed in the parental line (not detectable by 3 days; Figure S2A) and
appeared to be due to prior MAPKi exposure or pre-conditioning, which abolished the small
difference in the p-ERK recovery rate between the M249 P engineered lines vs. DDR4 and
DDR5 (Figure S3B).

We then assessed the relative potencies of individual alterations observed in M249 DDR4
and DDR5 to confer BRAFi+MEKi resistance in M249 P using both short- (Figures S3C–D)
and long-term (Figures 4H) survival assays. V600EBRAF high over-expression
or V600EBRAF low over-expression concurrent with a MEK1 mutant (F129L or Q56P)
conferred more than one-log (short-term) or two-log (long-term) increases in MAPKi
resistance. Interestingly, pre-conditioning of the engineered M249 lines conferred doubledrug addiction (Figure S3E–F). As was noted previously for DDR4 and DDR5 sub-lines
(Figures 3A, 4C), the double-drug addiction phenotype also exaggerated the apparent
double-drug resistance phenotype of pre-conditioned M249 P engineered with each genetic
configuration (Figure S3D). These data together (Figures 4E–F; Figure S3B–F) thus suggest
a mechanistic link between double-drug addiction and p-ERK rebound (see below in Figure
7). Moreover, supra-physiologically expressed V600E/R509HBRAF, defective in p-CRAF
induction (Figure 4G), was also compromised in its ability to resist repeated treatments with
BRAFi+MEKi (1 μM, 24 days). V600EBRAF low over-expression or MEK1 mutation alone
was individually able to confer BRAFi+MEKi resistance but only to an extent appreciably
weaker than achieved by their combination (see growth at 0.1 μM vs. 1.0 μM of drugs at
days 15 and 24) (Figure 4H). The combinatorial effects of over-expressed V600EBRAF and
MEK1 mutants on promoting the double-drug resistance phenotype could also be observed
in a different cell line (Figure S3 G–I). Thus, ERKi-sensitive, acquired resistance to BRAFi
+MEKi observed in DDR4 and DDR5 is causally attributable to either supra-physiologic
over-expression of V600EBRAF or a lower degree of V600EBRAF and MUTMEK overexpression (Figure 4I; Figure S3). Mechanistically, excess V600EBRAF proteins promote
dimerization with CRAF and CRAF activation/dependency.
Next, to dissect mechanistically how MUTMEK1 aids over-expressed V600EBRAF in
establishing a full double-drug resistance phenotype, we posited that overexpressed V600EBRAF and MUTMEK physically and functionally interact in a complex
facilitated by (i) the MEK mutant conformation, and (ii) a kinase-independent regulatory
role of V600EBRAF. This complex facilitates MEK phosphorylation/activation by CRAF,

akin to a modeled MEK-KSR2-BRAF regulatory complex (Brennan et al., 2011). Hence, we
tested whether F129LMEK1 in DDR5 (but not DDR4) would be more abundantly associated
physically with V600EBRAF. Accordingly, we immunoprecipitated BRAF in the M249
triplet and probed for MEK1 and MEK2 in the immunoprecipitates. Consistently, much
more MEK1 and MEK2 were detected in complex with BRAF in F129LMEK1-harboring
DDR5 (Figure 5A). We then specifically immunoprecipitated MEK1 and detected a
dramatically higher BRAF level bound to MEK1 in DDR5 (Figure 5B). However, the
pattern of BRAF-MEK2 binding was reversed; we detected more BRAF bound to MEK2 in
DDR4 (Figure 5C). MEK2 in DDR4 was also associated with the highest level of activationassociated phosphorylation at Ser226, consistent with MEK2 recruitment to and activation
by a BRAF-containing complex. Under the same conditions, we were unable to detect
CRAF or KSR2 in BRAF, MEK1, or MEK2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These
data suggest that the supra-physiologic level of V600EBRAF in DDR4 recruits
both WTMEK1 and WTMEK2 whereas the V600EBRAF level over-expressed to a lesser
extent in DDR5 recruits F129LMEK1 preferentially over WTMEK2.

We also assessed the relative phosphorylation status of MEK1 and MEK2 in DDR4 and
DDR5 16 hr after treatment with BRAFi+MEKi vs. M249 P treated with DMSO.
Interestingly, we observed that only DDR4, but not DDR5, harbored an enhanced level of
activation-associated MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylation (Figure 5D). In both DDR4 and
DDR5, MEK1 displayed increased levels of ERK-dependent negative feedback
phosphorylation on Thr291 within its proline-rich region of the kinase domain, which is not
present on MEK2, suggesting that the time-cumulative ERK activities are far greater in
DDR4 and DDR5 despite BRAFi+MEKi treatment than in parental M249. DDR5 harbored
the highest level of p-MEK1 Thr291, which has been shown to reduce MEK1-MEK2
hetero-dimerization and MEK2 Ser226 phosphorylation (Catalanotti et al., 2009) and may
also explain the reduced p-MEK1 Ser222 level (Figures 5D).

We then sought to reconstitute F129LMEK1-V600EBRAF interaction and its functional role in
DDR. We had observed that the majority of MEK1 and MEK2 mutations thus far detected
specifically in melanomas with clinically acquired BRAFi, MEKi, or BRAFi+MEKi
resistance (Emery et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014; Villanueva et al.,
2013; Wagle et al., 2011; Wagle et al., 2014) cluster three-dimensionally in or proximal to
helix A and C (Figure 5E; Movie S1). Specifically, in M249 P, we minimally overexpressed a series of FLAG-tagged MEK1 constructs and co-expressed either HAtagged WTBRAF or V600EBRAF, both at high levels akin to DDR5 (Figure 5F; Figure S4).
We then immunoprecipitated protein complexes via FLAG and detected MEK1, BRAF and
HA levels. Importantly, both F129LMEK1 and Q56PMEK1, which is homolog to Q60PMEK2,
displayed dramatically enhanced and preferential interaction with overexpressed V600EBRAF relative to WTMEK1. Anti-BRAF signals detected in the FLAGimmunoprecipitates presumably contained both endogenous and exogenous V600EBRAF.
Thus, these data support the notion that BRAFi+MEKi treatment in melanoma selects for
MEK1 or MEK2 mutations that impact a discrete structural sub-domain and leads to a
conformation favoring physical association with over-expressed V600EBRAF.

To assess the functional relevance of a V600EBRAF-MUTMEK complex, we searched for
clues of a BRAF-MEK physical interaction interface (Figure S5). Based on prior structural
data of MEK1-BRAF (Haling et al., 2014), vemurafenib-bound V600EBRAF (Bollag et al.,
2010), and MEK1-KSR2 (Brennan et al., 2011) and structural alignments of vemurafenibbound V600EBRAF with BRAF or KSR2, we hypothesized a
regulatory V600EBRAF-MUTMEK complex where V600EBRAF arginine 662 makes critical
contacts with MEK residues in one complex interface (Figure 6A–B). We predicted that the
R662L substitution in V600EBRAF would disrupt this face-to-face V600EBRAF-MUTMEK
interaction and attenuate the DDR phenotype. Ectopic expression of vector, HA-WTBRAF,
HA-V600EBRAF and HA-V600E/R662LBRAF in WTBRAF human 293T cells revealed that the
R662L substitution did not interfere with the V600EBRAF kinase activation status in the
absence of MAPKi (Figure 6C). We then engineered M249 P to stably express a
FLAG-F129LMEK1 or FLAG-Q56PMEK1 along with HA-tagged WT or various mutant
BRAF at levels akin to M249 DDR5 (Figure 6D). After BRAFi+MEKi treatment (1 μM, 16
hr), anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation followed by Western blots revealed that both MEK1
mutants most abundantly interacted with V600EBRAF, consistent with previous results
(Figure 5F). Importantly, the R662L mutation in the context of V600EBRAF strongly
abolished this enhanced V600EBRAF-MUTMEK1 complex and reduced the overall p-ERK
levels. V600E/R509HBRAF also appeared to display reduced interaction with MUTMEK1 but
without a reduction in the p-ERK levels, suggesting that this apparent reduction was due to
loss of BRAF dimers (Figure 6A) (Haling et al., 2014) or higher-order oligomers (Nan et al.,
2013) brought down by anti-FLAG. Consistently, whereas engineered M249 P lines highly
over-expressing V600EBRAF or minimally over-expressing V600E/R509HBRAF together with
a MEK1 mutant were able to resist robustly BRAFi+MEKi at 1 μM, those cell lines
expressing V600E/R662LBRAF or WTBRAF along with a MEK1 mutant grew poorly over 28
or 32 day treatments with BRAFi+MEKi (Figure 6E). Taken together, these studies (Figures
4–6; Figure S3–S5) highlighted a critical role of upstream MAPK reactivation, i.e.,
upregulation of the V600EBRAF-CRAF-MEK complex, in the MAPKi resistance phenotype.
Buildup of this plastic complex is dependent on the degree of BRAF and/or MEK inhibition
and likely other cell context determinants. In the extreme case of DDR, alternative
mechanisms to upregulate this complex can be achieved by V600EBRAF (variably overexpressed) interacting with WTCRAF or with MUTMEK.

Melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAFi+MEKi display exquisite dual drug
addiction
It has been reported recently that patient-derived xenografts with acquired resistance to
BRAFi driven by V600EBRAF amplification or RNA over-expression could potentially be
counter-selected during periods of BRAFi withdrawal (Thakur et al., 2013). We thus tested
the degree to which M249 DDR4 and DDR5 were addicted to each (BRAFi or MEKi) or
both (BRAFi+MEKi) inhibitors during long-term clonogenic growth. Three days after
seeding, DDR4 and DDR5 cells were kept continuously on both inhibitors, washed from
both, or replenished with only one of the two inhibitors. Both DDR4 and DDR4 were
strongly addicted to continuous treatment with BRAFi+MEKi (Figure 7A). The loss of
viability after acute BRAFi+MEKi washout could not be rescued by a dose of ERKi (1 μM)
sufficient to strongly suppress the rebound in p-ERK resulting from drug withdrawal (Figure

7B; Figure S6A). Additionally, this “high” dose of ERKi could re-sensitize DDR4 and
DDR5 to either BRAFi or BRAFi+MEKi, consistent with prior short-term MTT results
(Figure 3A). Notably, the anti-growth/survival effect of double-drug withdrawal was
comparable to that of ERKi alone or ERKi plus BRAFi (Figure 7B). However, ERKi at a
sub-optimal dose (0.1 μM), which could suppress the rebound p-ERK levels induced by
acute double-drug withdrawal, Figure S6B), completely rescued the anti-growth/survival
effects of BRAFi+MEKi withdrawal and partially “erased” the anti- growth/survival effects
of single BRAFi or MEKi withdrawal (Figure 7C). Importantly, a sub-optimal dose of ERKi
could be anti-growth/survival only if DDR4 and DDR5 were continuously treated with
BRAFi+MEKi. We then sought evidence consistent with melanoma regression in patients
who have been discontinued on MAPK-targeted therapies due to disease progression or
acquired drug resistance. From evaluable patients with melanoma who were treated with
BRAFi+MEKi (n=15) or single-agent BRAFi (n=16) therapies (Table S4), we
retrospectively collated radiologic images before and/or during disease progression and
compared them to images, when available or feasible, after a variable time off therapies
(Figure S6 C–D). Although specific clinical examples of tumor regression after cessation of
BRAFi+MEKi therapy could be identified, overall disease stabilization or uniform tumor
regression leading clinical remission could not be achieved. Moreover, only cases of tumor
growth deceleration could be observed for melanomas after cessation of single-agent BRAFi
therapy. Thus, the drug addiction phenotype can be readily elicited in DDR cell lines only if
MAPK inhibition were reversed acutely and completely, and additional factors may
modulate or mitigate this phenotype clinically.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the strong degree of double-drug addiction noted with both DDR4 and DDR5, we
asked whether this would be generalizable across different cellular contexts and to
melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAFi treatment alone. Interestingly, we found
that melanoma cell lines adapted to growth with BRAFi+MEKi far more consistently
displayed drug addiction (Figure 7D). Also consistent was the observation that melanoma
cell lines with DDR displayed a greater rebound in p-ERK levels after drug washout (Figure
7E). This greater rebound was not necessarily due to the maximal p-ERK levels upon
withdrawal of drugs but rather due to the very low p-ERK levels in the presence of both
drugs (i.e., stronger on-target pathway suppression). Quantification of the fold changes in pERK levels (Figure 7E) and in clonogenic growths (Figure 7D) showed that they are
strongly negatively correlated. Thus, melanoma cells with DDR displayed a stronger
rebound in p-ERK levels and drug addiction upon drug withdrawal, when compared to
melanoma cells with single-drug resistance withdrawn from BRAFi (Figure 7F). This pERK rebound is indicative of drug addiction since a sub-optimal dose of ERKi could rescue
cells from double-drug withdrawal-induced loss of fitness (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
The understanding of how BRAF mutant melanomas frequently acquire BRAFi resistance
via several distinct mechanisms, which thematically reactivate the MAPK pathway, has
provided foundational rationale to combined BRAF/MEK inhibition to suppress such
mechanisms. The ensuing translational effort has led to this combination supplanting BRAFi
monotherapy in the clinic. This study of genetic alterations in melanomas with acquired

BRAFi+MEKi resistance has provided unexpected insights. First, we detected alterations
affecting similar genes known to be responsible for acquired BRAFi resistance, which
suggests that the gene dosage or concurrence of these mutations may impart altered
molecular interactions promoting BRAFi+MEKi resistance. The exaggerated genetic
configurations encompassed GOF (e.g., V600EBRAF ultra-amplification, G12RNRAS
amplification) and LOF (e.g. F127VPTEN, deletions affecting PTEN, CDKN2A, DUSP4)
alterations, and their combinations. Second, focusing on MAPK-reactivation, we uncovered
a highly plastic or tunable RAF-MEK complex resulting from mutations (SNVs and/or
CNVs). For instance, supra-physiologic levels of V600EBRAF allosterically relay oncogenic
MAPK signaling via back-to-back interactions with CRAF. Moreover, moderately overexpressed levels of V600EBRAF likely regulate MEK1 and MEK2 activation via a face-toface complex. These altered molecular interactions underscore an intrinsic limitation of
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition and predict potential limitations of further
downstream inhibitors (e.g., ERKi) in overcoming acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thus, we have shown how (1) quantitative genetic alterations or gene dosage impact
qualitative modes of signaling, and (2) combinatorial alterations might be selected to impact
survival signaling cooperatively (Figure 8). MEK1 and MEK2 mutants with alterations
residing in or proximal to the helix A/C sub-structure share an increased ability to form an
activation-associated complex with V600EBRAF, especially when both BRAF and MEK
mutants are moderately over-expressed. Moreover, a proposed MUTMEK-V600EBRAF
hetero-dimer interface strongly suggests that such a face-to-face physical interaction
involves predominantly a kinase-independent or regulatory function of V600EBRAF.
Together, these data indicate a V600EBRAF-CRAF-MEK1/MEK2 signaling loop that is
highly susceptible to up-regulation via single or multiple convergent genetic (and likely nongenetic) alterations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our study of melanoma cell lines with acquired resistance to combined BRAF and MEK
inhibition has revealed insights into recent clinical studies. For instance, melanoma cell lines
with preexisting BRAFi resistance augment preexisting mechanisms quickly as they adapt to
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition. This is consistent with the clinical observation that
patients who progressed on BRAFi or MEKi monotherapies infrequently respond to the
addition of the other inhibitor, and, for those who do respond sequentially, the responses are
generally highly transient. Furthermore, the importance of a MAPKi resistance-related
complex has certain translational implications.
Successful strategies targeting this tunable-combinatorial signaling complex may include
those inhibiting CRAF function (e.g., omni- or pan-RAF inhibitors), V600EBRAF-CRAF
interaction, V600EBRAF-MUTMEK interaction/scaffolding, and MEK activation (e.g.,
phosphorylation by RAF). These strategies could be built around continued inhibition of
mutant BRAF and MEK or alternating regimens. In our studies, the efficacy of an ERK
inhibitor in overcoming acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance was nuanced and depended on
the experimental contexts, e.g., ERKi alone at lower concentrations promoted survival/
growth of BRAFi+MEKi resistant melanoma cells in both short- and long-term assays.

While the build-up of a V600EBRAF-CRAF-MEK complex ultimately limited the efficacy of
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma, this signaling complex appeared to be
poised to deliver a lethal dose of signaling once both inhibitors were efficiently and acutely
removed (Figure 8). Melanoma cells with fully acquired BRAFi+MEKi resistance were
much more sensitive to drug withdrawal than those with acquired resistance to BRAFi
alone. It is possible that in vivo factors, such as tumor heterogeneity (e.g., sub-populations
with reversible drug-tolerance but without drug addiction), three-dimensional cell-cell
contacts, microenviromental signals, and/or host pharmacokinetic considerations, could
render drug addiction a clinically intractable phenotype. In this light, the hypothesis of
intermittent therapy with combined BRAFi and MEKi to delay acquired resistance will be
tested prospectively within a large randomized clinical trial (SWOG/CTEP S1320) for the
treatment of patients with BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patients, Tumor Samples and Genomic Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Melanoma tissues and patient-matched normal tissues were collected with the approval of
Institutional Review Boards at UCLA, UCSF and Vanderbilt and informed consents of each
patient. Patients were enrolled in GlaxoSmithKline or Roche/Genetech clinical trials or
treated per standard clinical management. We evaluated 45 tumor samples (27 DD-DP, four
DP and 14 baseline or early on-treatment melanoma biopsies) from 14 patients who were
either treated with BRAFi+MEKi upfront or with this combination after progression on
BRAFi. In each tumor, genetic mechanisms (excluding PI3K-PTEN-AKT genetic hits)
known to confer clinical resistance to BRAFi were detected by gDNA Q-PCR and/or Sanger
sequencing. Twenty-three baseline and DD-DP tumors from seven patients along with
normal tissues were whole exome sequence (WES)-analyzed to detect somatic alterations
which are in the MAPK and PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathways and which are specific to drugresistant tumors. Pair-end sequences with read length of 2×100 bps using the Illumina
HiSeq2000 platform were generated. SNVs, INDELs and CNVs were analyzed and
visualized as described (Shi et al., 2014).
Targeted Sequencing, Copy Number Quantification, and WES of Cell Lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BRAF, NRAS, and DUSP4 cDNA levels were quantified by real time RT-PCR using
TUBULIN and GAPDH levels for normalization. Relative expressions were calculated using
the delta-Ct method. BRAF, NRAS, and DUSP4 gDNA relative copy numbers were
quantified by real time PCR with total gDNA content estimated by assaying the β-globin
gene in each sample. All primer sequences are available upon request. Sanger sequencing
was performed using purified PCR via BigDye v1.1 (Applied Biosystems) in combination
with a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). WES of M249 triple cell lines were
analyzed for shared and distinct genetic alterations and their phylogenetic relationship.
Cell Culture, Constructs, Infections, and Transfections
All cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2
mmol/L glutamine in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator, with the addition of 10 ng/mL
doxycycline and/or puromycin, when applicable. Stocks and dilutions of PLX4032/

vemurafenib (Plexxikon, Berkeley, CA, USA), AZD6244/selumetinib (Selleck Chemicals)
and SCH772984 (MERCK) were made in DMSO. Cell proliferation experiments were
performed in a 96-well format (5 replicates per sample); drug treatments were initiated 24
hours post-seeding for 72 hour; and cell survival quantified using CellTiter-GLO (Promega).
Clonogenic assays were performed by plating cells at single cell density in 6-well plates
with fresh media and drug replenished every two days. Colonies were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.05% crystal violet. shBRAF, shCRAF, shPTEN and
shNRAS were subcloned into the lentiviral vector pLL3.7; shDUSP4/pLK0.1 vectors were
obtained commercially (GE Dharmacon). All WT and mutant MEK1 and BRAF constructs
were epitope-tagged and sub-cloned into the doxycycline-repressible lentiviral vector
pLVX-Tight-Puro (Clontech, Inc). Viral supernatants were generated by third-generation
lentiviral packaging using human embryonic kideny (HEK) 293T cells. HEK293T cells
were transfected using BioT (Bioland).
Protein Detection, Interaction, and Structure

Cell lysates were made in RIPA buffer (Sigma) for direct Western blotting or in a PNE
buffer (PBS:H2O at 1 :1, 0.5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) for immunoprecipitation,
with both buffers supplemented with protease (Roche) and phosphatase (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) inhibitor cocktails. Western blots and immunoprecipitations were performed
using the following antibodies : p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), p-MEK1/2 (S217/221), p-AKT
(Thr308), p-CRAF (S338), total ERK1/2, MEK1/2, MEK1, MEK2, AKT, CRAF, DUSP4

(C-19), p-MEK1 (Thr291), p-MEK1 (S222) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p-MEK2
(S226) (US Biological). Western blot quantification was performed using NIH Image J. The
three-dimension structures of MEK1 (3EQC) and PTEN mutants were modeled by the ITASSER online server. Modeling the V600EBRAF-MUTMEK1 dimer interface was based on
the crystal structure of the WTBRAF-WTMEK1 dimer (4MNE), the MEK1-KSR2 dimer
(2Y4I), and the asymmetric, vemurafenib-bound, V600EBRAF dimer (3GO7). Protein
structures were visualized using Pymol™

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The understanding that BRAF mutant melanomas frequently acquire BRAFi resistance
via MAPK pathway reactivation has guided the development of combined BRAF and
MEK targeted therapy. Our finding that acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK cotargeting is driven by highly tunable-combinatorial mechanisms of resistance underscores
the intrinsic limitation of dual MAPK pathway targeting. Mechanistic studies
highlight V600EBRAF-WTCRAF and V600EBRAF-MUTMEK interactions as a basis for
ERK-reactivation. Additionally, we demonstrate that melanoma cells with acquired
BRAFi+MEKi resistance are exquisitely sensitive to acute drug withdrawal. Exploiting
melanoma addiction to BRAFi+MEKi for therapeutic gain is being tested, via
intermittent drug dosing, in the clinic (SWOG/CTEP S1320).

Figure 8. Alterations in a V600EBRAF-CRAF-MEK Complex with Opposite Impacts on
Melanoma Fitness Contingent on the Presence of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors

Alternative configurations of a RAF-MEK resistance-related complex consisting of (1) a
supra-physiologic level of V600EBRAF, which activates CRAF, or (2) a moderately overexpressed V600EBRAF level concomitant with a mutant MEK1/2, which leads to
increased V600EBRAF-MUTMEK interaction. Both signaling configurations strongly favor
ERK activation, leading to growth/survival finely tuned to the BRAFi+MEKi level.
Paradoxically, acute removal of BRAFi+MEKi disrupts this fine-tuning and results in a pERK rebound favoring cell arrest/death (i.e., drug addiction). WT (grey) and mutant (red)
proteins; BRAFi or MEKi, blue circles.
