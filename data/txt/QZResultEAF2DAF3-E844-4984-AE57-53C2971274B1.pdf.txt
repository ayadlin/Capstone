Abstract
Practical methods for enhancing protein production in vivo remain a challenge. RNA activation (RNAa) is
emerging as one potential solution by using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to increase endogenous gene
expression. This approach, although related to RNA interference (RNAi), facilitates a response opposite to gene
silencing. Duplex dsP21-322 and its chemically modiﬁed variants are examples of RNAa-based drugs that inhibit
cancer cell growth by inducing expression of tumor suppressor p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21). In this study, we investigate the
therapeutic potential of dsP21-322 in an orthotopic model of bladder cancer by formulating a 20 -ﬂuoro-modiﬁed
derivative (dsP21-322-20 F) into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for intravesical delivery. LNP composition is based upon
clinically relevant formulations used in RNAi-based therapies consisting of PEG-stabilized unilamellar liposomes
built with lipid DLin-KC2-DMA. We conﬁrm p21 induction, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vitro following
treatment with LNP-formulated dsP21-322-20 F (LNP-dsP21-322-20 F) or one of its nonformulated variants. Both 20 ﬂuoro modiﬁcation and LNP formulation also improve duplex stability in urine. Intravesical delivery of LNPdsP21-322-20 F into mouse bladder results in urothelium uptake and extends survival of mice with established
orthotopic human bladder cancer. LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatment also facilitates p21 activation in vivo leading to
regression/disappearance of tumors in 40% of the treated mice. Our results provide preclinical proof-of-concept
for a novel method to treat bladder cancer by intravesical administration of LNP-formulated RNA duplexes.

Introduction
Bladder cancer is the ﬁfth most common human malignancy
(1). Approximately 70% of bladder cancer incidences are
diagnosed at a superﬁcial stage in which about half will recur
following transurethral resection (TUR) despite post-op therapy. Intravesical administration of chemical and/or immunologic agents (e.g., mitomycin, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, etc.) is
often used to eradicate residual tumor cells; however, such
treatments can have limited efﬁcacy and adverse side effects
(2). As many as 10% to 30% of recurrent tumors will progress to
a higher grade and stage inevitably forming locally invasive
cancer (3, 4). Radical cystectomy remains the standard treat-

ment of muscle-invasive bladder tumors, which often results in
signiﬁcant deterioration of urinary and sexual function. As
such, new therapeutic options are needed for treating residual
tumor after TUR, as well as advanced bladder cancer.
RNA interference (RNAi) is currently one of the leading
platform technologies being developed in the clinic as an
oligonucleotide-based approach to gene therapy. It is an
evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene regulation by
which small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules—
termed small interfering RNA (siRNA)—degrade complementary messenger RNA to silence gene expression (5). By using
siRNAs as therapeutic compounds, it is possible to block the
production of disease-causing proteins. However, effective
uptake of siRNAs by cells requires support of a delivery vehicle
to penetrate the cell membrane. Lipid-based vectors remain
the preferred approach for siRNA delivery both in vitro and in
vivo. Precise formulation with lipids and other molecular
components (i.e., polyethylene glycol-lipid, cholesterol, etc.)
allows encapsulation of siRNAs into stable liposomal nanoparticles (LNP) for improved bioavailability. Currently, ionizable lipid DLin-KC2-DMA is one of the leading materials for
LNP formulation to safely deliver siRNA molecules in vivo (6).
Safe strategies to selectively enhance gene and/or protein
production remain a challenge in gene therapy. Viral-based
systems are effective at delivering exogenous constructs to
facilitate gene overexpression, but have serious drawbacks (i.e.,

adverse effects on host genome integrity, immunologic consequences, etc.) that hinder progression in the clinic. Recently,
small dsRNAs—termed small activating RNA (saRNA)—have
also been shown to induce gene expression in a phenomenon
referred to as RNA activation (RNAa; refs. 7, 8). Several models
of RNAa have been described including transcriptional activation by targeting promoter sequences and/or overlapping
noncoding regulatory transcripts using saRNA (7, 9–11). This
technique offers a similar approach as RNAi, while representing a new strategy to stimulate endogenous gene expression.
The tumor suppressor protein p53 controls cell-cycle progression, senescence, and apoptosis in response to DNA damage through transactivation of numerous growth inhibitory
genes (12). One such downstream target is the CDK inhibitor
p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21). By suppressing CDK activity, p21 promotes
hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein leading to cell-cycle arrest (13). In addition, p21 interacts with
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) interfering with DNA
replication and cell division (14). In fact, ectopic expression of
p21 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and induce
apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (15–17). As such, p21 is a
major downstream effector of p53 signaling and is itself
considered a potent tumor suppressor.
Alterations to the p53 pathway represent one of the major
contributors to bladder tumorigenesis (18, 19). Despite frequent disruption of the p53 protein, loss-of-function mutations
leading to p21 inactivation are a rare event (20, 21). Rather,
bladder cancer progression has been associated with general
decreases in p21 expression (20, 21). In this regard, p21 may be
an ideal target for RNAa to inhibit bladder cancer cell growth.
Although the therapeutic potential of RNAa has been shown in
xenograft tumors following intratumoral injection of LNPformulated saRNA molecules (22), it has not been evaluated
in a clinically relevant model of cancer using a practical route of
drug administration. In the present study, we assess the
antitumor activity of RNAa in an orthotopic model of bladder
cancer following intravesical delivery of LNP-formulated
saRNA to facilitate p21 induction. LNP composition consisted
of lipid DLin-KC2-DMA and resembled RNAi-based formulations. We conﬁrm that LNP-formulated saRNA facilitates p21
induction and possesses antiproliferative activity in bladder
cancer cells. In vivo analyses reveal that intravesical treatment
of mice with orthotopic bladder cancer extends animal survival
and inhibits tumor growth. Our results provide proof-of-principle that DLin-KC2-DMA-based nanoparticles have application in delivering RNA duplexes to facilitate RNAa in vivo, as
well as deﬁne a candidate RNAa-based drug for the treatment
of localized bladder cancer by intravesical instillation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
Human bladder cancer cell line KU-7 engineered to stably
express ﬁreﬂy luciferase and green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
was purchased from Caliper Life Sciences. T24-P cells are a
highly tumorigenic bladder cancer subline derived from T24
cells (23) acquired from Dr. Jer-Tsong Hsieh at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. No further
authentication of cell lines was done by the authors. KU-7 cells

5070

were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. T24-P cells were
maintained in T-Medium (Invitrogen) also supplemented with
10% FBS and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate. The day before
transfection, cells were plated in growth medium without
antibiotics at a density of 50% to 60%. Transfection of
nonformulated saRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Treatment of LNP-formulated duplexes was done by
simply adding LNP solution directly to cell culture medium.
The following day, transfection media was replaced with fresh
media containing antibiotics. All saRNA sequences including
chemical modiﬁcations are listed in Table S1.
Lipid nanoparticle composition
Nanoparticles were prepared with the ionizable lipid
1,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLinKC2-DMA), disteroylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol,
and 1-(monomethoxy polyethyleneglycol)-2,3-dimyristoylglycerol (PEG–DMG) using a spontaneous vesicle formation
formulation procedure as previously described (24). Detailed
protocol is available in Supplementary Methods.
Urine stability assay
Solutions containing 1 mL of 20 mmol/L saRNA and 10 mL
undiluted mouse or human urine were incubated at 37 C. The
mixtures were ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen at desired time
points to halt nuclease activity until the time course was
complete. Samples were subsequently mixed with loading
buffer and analyzed on an agarose gel to visualize duplex levels.
saRNA uptake analysis
T24-P cells (1.0  105) were treated with LNP-formulated
FITC-labeled dsP21-322-0 F (dsP21-322-20 F-FITC) for 24 hours.
Female C57BL/6 mice were anaesthetized with isoﬂurane and
bladders rinsed twice with 0.2 mL PBS through a 24-guage
catheter. LNP-formulated dsP21-322-20 F-FITC (1.68 mg/kg,
33.5 mg) was administered intravesically and retained in the
bladder for 2 hours by tying off the oriﬁce of the urethra.
Mice were sacriﬁced at 2 or 9 hours (including indwelling time)
after saRNA delivery. Animals treated for 9 hours were denied
water to limit excretion of formulated duplex. Whole bladders
were removed, placed in cryomolds containing optimal cutting
temperature compound, and frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections were cut to 8 mm and mounted onto glass slides. Both cell
and tissue slides were ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and washed with PBS containing sucrose. The ﬁxed sections
were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) using VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and saRNA uptake was visualized using ﬂuorescence
microscopy.
Orthotopic model of bladder cancer and intravesical
treatment
The animal study was carried out according to a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
The orthotopic murine model of bladder cancer was a

modiﬁcation of a previously described technique (25, 26).
In brief, female nude (nu/nu) mice at 8 to 10 weeks of
age (Simonsen Laboratory) were anaesthetized with isoﬂurane. Chemical lesions to the bladder urothelium were carried
out by injecting 10 mL of 0.5 M silver nitrate into the bladder of
each animal through a 24-gauge catheter. Bladders were
washed with PBS and subsequently instilled with KU-7 cells
(2.0  106) suspended in 50 mL PBS via catheter. At this point,
animals were dosed with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine
(10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Cells were retained in
the bladder for 2 hours by tying off the oriﬁce of the urethra.
One day following tumor cell implantation, in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of KU-7 cells was evaluated on a
IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) following intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin
(Gold Biotechnology). Bioluminescence signal (BLS) was
acquired and analyzed using Living Image software version
4.10 (Xenogen). Regions of interest (ROI) were deﬁned manually to encompass the bladder and quantify signal intensity.
Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into 3 treatment
groups (PBS, LNP-dsCon-20 F, and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F) each
containing 9 to 10 animals. Mice received 3 mg/kg of LNPformulated duplex in a volume of 50 mL by intravesical administration into the bladder via catheter. Each treatment was
retained in the bladder for 2 hours by tying off the oriﬁce of the
urethra while the animal was anaesthetized. PBS treatments
were done at volumes equivalent to LNP-dsP21-322-20 F doses.
Animals were treated 14 total times every 3 days beginning at
day 4 postimplantation. BLS and body weight were monitored
weekly. A death was recorded if animals met AVMA guidelines
for euthanasia as a result of tumor burden including body
condition score (BCS) 2 and 20% weight loss. The study was
terminated 8 weeks following tumor installation. Any surviving
mice were euthanized and all major organs including bladders
were inspected for cancer. Bladder tumor tissue was divided in
half and placed in either RIPA buffer containing protease
inhibitors or 10% neutral buffered formalin for immunoblot
analysis or immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.
Statistical analyses
The differences in continuous variables between treatments
were assessed by Student t test (for 2 treatments) or ANOVA
(for 3 or more treatments). Log rank tests determined statistical signiﬁcance of Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Signiﬁcance
was deﬁned as P < 0.05. Additional experimental procedures
are described in Supplementary Methods.

Results
dsP21-322 induces p21 expression in human bladder
cancer cells
By screening several duplexes targeting the p21 promoter,
dsP21-322 has been identiﬁed as a lead saRNA molecule with
antitumor activity in prostate cancer (22). Earlier in vitro
studies have showed that dsP21-322 also possesses growth
inhibitory function in T24 and J82 bladder cancer cell lines (27).
To further evaluate dsP21-322 activity in bladder cancer, we
transfected KU-7 and T24-P cells with dsP21-322 for 72 hours.

www.aacrjournals.org

Analysis of mRNA expression revealed that dsP21-322 profoundly induced p21 levels compared with mock and nonspeciﬁc control (dsCon) treatments (Fig. 1A). Induction of p21 was
further conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B,
elevated levels of p21 protein correlate to the increase in p21
mRNA expression. Morphologically, dsP21-322 treatment
caused cells to appear less dense and acquire larger, more
ﬂattened shapes; phenotypes indicative of impeded cell growth
(Fig. S1). These results imply dsP21-322 retains RNAa activity
and growth inhibitory function in KU-7 and T24-P cells.
Activity of LNP-formulated dsP21-322-20 F and its
nonformulated variants
Chemical modiﬁcation (e.g., 20 -ﬂuoro) is often required to
improve the medicinal properties of duplex RNAs for in vivo
application (28). We previously deﬁned a chemically modiﬁed
variant of dsP21-322 (dsP21-322-20 F) with improved nuclease
resistance in serum and reduced immunostimulatory activity
by introducing 20 -ﬂuoro modiﬁcations to all pyrimidine
nucleotides in its antisense strand (22). To further improve
its in vivo applicability, we formulated dsP21-322-20 F into lipid
nanoparticles (LNP-dsP21-322-20 F) composed of ionizable
lipid DLin-KC2-DMA creating PEG-stabilized unilamellar liposomal vesicles. Nonspeciﬁc lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPdsCon-20 F) were also formulated as a control. Comparative
analysis of in vitro potency between nonformulated dsP21-322
and dsP21-322-20 F in KU-7 cells revealed similar EC50
(half maximal effective concentration) values of 1.42 and
1.70 nmol/L at 72 hours, respectively (Fig. 1C). In addition,
dsP21-322-20 F retained strong RNAa activity as compared with
dsP21-322. As shown in Fig. 1C, dsP21-322-20 F consistently
increased p21 levels by 9-fold at maximal activity, whereas
dsP21-322 increased p21 levels by 5-fold. Dose-response
experiments with LNP-dsP21-322-20 F indicated an EC50 of
0.24 mg/mL with maximal activity reaching 10-fold increases
in p21 levels (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analyses also revealed dosedependent induction of p21 protein by dsP21-322, dsP21-32220 F, and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F (Fig. 1D). We conducted dose–
response experiments evaluating cell viability by MTS assay
and calculated IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)
values to measure the antiproliferative potency of LNP-dsP21322-20 F and its nonformulated variants. Nonformulated dsP21322 and dsP21-322-20 F had similar IC50 values of 0.72 and 0.74
nmol/L, respectively; whereas LNP-dsP21-322-20 F had an IC50
of 0.19 mg/mL at 72 hours (Fig. S2A). Phenotypically, dsP21-32220 F and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatments caused dose-dependent changes in cell morphology and density similar to
dsP21-322 (Fig S2B). Taken together, these results indicate
that neither chemical modiﬁcation nor LNP formulation negatively impacted RNAa activity or the growth inhibitory function of dsP21-322.
LNP-formulated dsP21-322-20 F and its nonormulated
variants cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in bladder
cancer cells
To investigate cell-cycle distribution, DNA content was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry in cells stained with propidium
iodide (PI) following treatment with LNP-dsP21-322-20 F or one

Figure 1. Activity of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F and its nonformulated derivatives in bladder cancer cells. A, human KU-7 and T24-P cells were transfected with 50
nmol/L of the indicated duplexes for 72 hours. Mock samples were transfected in the absence of dsRNA. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to assess p21
and GAPDH mRNA levels. Ampliﬁcation of GAPDH served as a loading control. B, protein levels of p21 and GAPDH were evaluated by immunoblot analysis
using protein-speciﬁc antibodies. C, KU-7 cells were treated with accumulating concentrations of dsP21-322, dsP21-322-20 F, and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
for 72 hours. Expression of p21 was quantiﬁed by real-time PCR (mean  SD from 2 independent experiments). Maximum and minimum levels of induction
correlate to 100% and 0% response, respectively. Duplex (nmol/L) and nanoparticle (mg/mL) concentration are shown in log scale. Dotted lines illustrate
approximate EC50 values. D, KU-7 cells were transfected at the indicated concentrations of formulated (LNP-dsCon-20 F and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F) or
nonformulated (dsCon, dsP21-322, and dsP21-322-20 F) duplex for 72 hours. Protein levels of p21 and GAPDH were evaluated by immunoblot analysis using
protein-speciﬁc antibodies. Concentrations of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F (mg/mL) correspond to total nanoparticle, whereas dsP21-322 and dsP21-322-20 F
treatments represent concentrations (nmol/L) of only the individual duplexes. Data are representative of n ¼ 3.

of its variants. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, transfection of dsP21322 or dsP21-322-20 F caused G0–G1 arrest in KU-7 cells as
indicated by the increase in G0–G1 cell number and concurrent
declines in S and G2–M populations. LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
treatment also caused changes in cell-cycle distribution similar
to dsP21-322 and dsP21-322-20 F corroborating that LNP formulation did not interfere with the growth inhibitory function
of dsP21-322-20 F (Fig. 2A and B).
Cell-cycle arrest by p21 is primarily mediated although
inhibition of CDK activity leading to Rb hypophosphorylation
(22, 29). As such, we evaluated phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb)
levels in KU-7 cells following treatment with dsP21-322,
dsP21-322-20 F or LNP-dsP21-322-20 F. As shown in Fig. 2C,
transfection with nonformulated dsP21-322 and dsP21-32220 F reduced p-Rb levels in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
total Rb protein remained generally unchanged. Similarly,
LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatment also reduced p-Rb levels at
elevated doses (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that p21 induction
resulted in a functional protein capable of manipulating Rb
phosphorylation.

Overexpression of p21 has been reported to have proapoptotic function in several cancer cell types contributing to its
tumor suppressor activity (12, 27, 30). To quantify the apoptotic cell fraction following duplex treatments, KU-7 cells were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry following staining with 7-AAD and
Annexin V-PE. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, mock and dsCon
treatments deﬁned baseline apoptosis in KU-7 cells, whereas
transfection with dsP21-322 or dsP21-322-20 F caused similar
dose-dependent increases in early and late stage apoptosis.
LNP-dsCon-20 F mirrored nonformulated control treatments;
however, LNP-dsP21-322-20 F caused robust detection of early
and late stage apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner
similar to dsP21-322 and dsP21-322-20 F transfections (Fig. 3A
and B). We also measured caspase-3/7 activity (2 key enzymes
of the apoptotic signaling cascade) in culture media following
duplex treatments. Transfection of dsP21-322 or dsP21-322-20 F
possessed signiﬁcantly higher caspase-3/7 activity than control
treatments (Fig. 3C). Likewise, LNP-dsP21-322-20 F caused similar increases in caspase 3/7 signaling, whereas LNP-dsCon-20 F
treatment had nominal effects on caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 3C).

by immunoblot analysis. GAPDH
served as a loading control.

Immunoblot analysis was also carried out to monitor reductions in procaspase-3 levels (a marker for caspase-3 activation)
and cleavage of PARP (a downstream substrate of caspase
signaling). Transfection with dsP21-322 or dsP21-322-20 F led
to reductions in procaspase-3 (caspase-3) with concurrent
detection of PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D). Similarly, LNP-dsP21322-20 F mirrored nonformulated transfection results (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, these results indicate that treatment with LNPdsP21-322-20 F or its nonformulated variants also promote
apoptosis contributing to the antitumor activity in bladder
cancer cells.
Pharmacokinetic properties of LNP-formulated dsP21322-20 F
Urine is a liquid waste product excreted by the kidney and
stored in the bladder that is rich in nucleases including
ribonucleases (31). To test the stability of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
and its nonformulated derivatives in urine, we incubated equal
quantities of duplex with fresh human or mouse urine for up to
6 days. Unmodiﬁed dsP21-322 was generally unstable in human
urine having completed degraded within 3 hours; however, 20 ﬂuoro modiﬁcation of dsP21-322 (dsP21-322-20 F) signiﬁcantly
increased duplex stability extending its life to 24 hours (Fig.
4A). Packaging RNA into nanoparticles has also been shown to
protect encapsulated cargo from degradation by nucleases
(32). As such, LNP formulation further improved its nuclease

www.aacrjournals.org

resistance increasing its stability to 6 days in human urine.
Surprisingly, duplex stability behaved very different in mouse
urine. Almost no apparent degradation of unmodiﬁed, modiﬁed, or LNP-formulated saRNA was observed (Fig. 4A). Stability studies in sterile water resembled the time course in
mouse urine suggesting nominal ribonuclease activity and/or
inherent duplex stability in mouse urine (Fig. S3A). In support,
analysis of untreated mouse urine yielded stable background
detection of low molecular weight nucleic acids, whereas
human urine was devoid of any inherent nucleic acid signal
(Fig. S3B). These data indicate that both 20 ﬂuoro modiﬁcation
and LNP formulation improve duplex stability in human urine;
however, inherent differences in nuclease activity/composition between human and mouse urine may inﬂuence in vivo
properties in either species.
To assess in vitro and in vivo uptake of LNP-formulated
saRNA, FITC was conjugated to the 30 terminus of dsP21-32220 F (dsP21-322-20 F-FITC) and formulated into unilamellar LNP
vesicles with DLin-KC2-DMA. When LNP-formulated dsP21322-20 F-FITC was directly added to cultured cells, uptake was
evident in nearly all cells with ﬂuorescence mainly localized to
the cytoplasm and a few punctate nuclear loci at 24 hours (Fig.
4B). In vivo uptake was evaluated by directly treating the
bladders of normal mice with LNP-formulated dsP21-32220 F-FITC via intravesical administration. After 2 hours of
treatment, dsP21-322-20 F-FITC uptake was observed in cells

the urothelium (Fig. 4C). Fluorescence remained readily
detectable in bladder cells by 9 hours (Fig. 4D). Images taken
at higher magniﬁcation clearly show intracellular distribution
of dsP21-322-20 F-FITC at 2 and 9 hours (Fig. S4). These data
indicate that LNP formulation effectively delivers saRNA
duplex into the bladder epithelium.
Intravesical treatment of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F inhibits
growth of orthotopic bladder tumors
To test the antitumor activity of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F in vivo,
we established orthotopic bladder cancer in 40 immunocompromised (nu/nu) mice by intravesical instillation of KU-7
cells. BLS from KU-7 cells was detected by measuring
photons/second following intraperitoneal administration of
luciferase substrate (D-luciferin). The day following tumor cell
instillation, 29 mice (72.5%) produced BLS and were randomly
divided into 3 treatment groups including PBS (n ¼ 9), LNP-

dsCon-20 F (n ¼ 10), and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F (n ¼ 10). No
statistical difference in BLS intensity or body weight was
detected between groups at time of randomization. Intravesical treatment was initiated on day 4 postimplantation and
repeated every 3 days for 14 total doses (Fig. 5A). BLI was done
weekly to monitor tumor burden. Animal survival was the
primary endpoint.
At the end of the 8 week study, the median survival time
for PBS, LNP-dsCon-20 F, and LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatment
groups was 9, 13, and 45 days, respectively. Five mice (50%)
remained alive in the LNP-dsP21-322-20 F population, whereas
1 mouse (11%) survived in the PBS group and none (0%)
represented LNP-dsCon-20 F-treated animals. Kaplan–Meier
cumulative survival analysis revealed LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatment signiﬁcantly extended animal survival compared with
PBS and LNP-dsCon-20 F, whereas no signiﬁcant difference was
detected between the 2 control groups (Fig. 5B). Four of the
surviving mice in the LNP-dsP21-322-20 F treatment population

dsP21-322, dsP21-322-20 F, and
LNP-dsP21-322-20 F were incubated
in mouse or human urine for the

agarose gel. B, T24-P cells were
treated with LNP-formulated dsP21322-20 F-FITC (0.3 mg/mL) for 24
hours. Cells were subsequently
ﬁxed, counterstained with DAPI
(blue), and analyzed by ﬂuorescent
microscopy to visualize intracellular
uptake of dsP21-322-20 F-FITC in
vitro (green). C and D, one dose
(33.5 mg) of LNP-formulated
dsP21-322-20 F-FITC was instilled by
intravesical administration into the
bladder of normal mice and kept
indwelling for 2 hours. Bladders were
surgically removed at 2 hours (C) or 9
hours (D) following instillation for
cryosectioning. Tissue sections were
counterstained with DAPI and
visualized by ﬂuorescent

showed gradual reductions in tumor burden in which 3 eventually became tumor-free as evidenced by the disappearance in
BLS (Fig. 6A and B). Removal and dissection of tumor-free
bladders were devoid of GFP signal upon inspection by ﬂuorescence microscopy to further suggest tumor disappearance
(Fig. S5). In one of the tumor-free animals, a white area of
scarred tissue with negative GFP signal was found in the
bladder wall suggesting regression of an established tumor
(Fig. S5). Similar observations have been noted following
regression of prostate xenograft tumors treated with dsP21322-20 F formulated into lipidoid-based nanoparticles (22).
Histologic evaluation revealed in some instances that orthotopic tumor from control groups invaded into the bladder
detrosal muscle layer (Fig. S6A). In addition, kidney metastases
were found in 2 of 9, 1 of 10, and 3 of 10 mice within the PBS,

noted.
IHC analysis of harvested mouse bladders revealed strong
nuclear staining for p21 in LNP-dsP21-322-20 F-treated tumors
as compared with PBS and LNP-dsCon-20 F control tissue (Fig.

activation in LNP-dsP21-322-20 F-treated tumors indicative of
apoptosis (Fig. 7A). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
Ki67 detection were used to identify orthotopic tumor in the
tissue slides (Fig. 7A). Increased levels of p21 protein were also
evaluated by immunoblot analysis in protein extracts prepared
from total homogenized tissue (Fig. 7B). Densitometry analysis
measured 3.3- to 5.2-fold increase in p21 levels within LNPdsP21-322-20 F-treated tissue (Fig. 7C). These results conﬁrm in

Discussion
We previously showed that dsP21-322 possesses in vitro
antigrowth activity in T24 and J82 bladder cancer cell lines
(27). In the present study, we implement a chemically-modiﬁed

variant of dsP21-322 (dsP21-322-20 F) with improved nuclease
resistance and reduced immunostimulatory activity to
improve its pharmaceutical properties for in vivo application
(22). In addition, we use a clinically relevant LNP delivery
system currently being implemented for RNAi-based therapies
to achieve intracellular uptake of dsP21-322-20 F in target
tissue. Intravesical administration of LNP-formulated dsP21322-20 F (LNP-dsP21-322-20 F) into murine bladders with

orthotopic cancer inhibited tumor growth and extended animal survival. Our results provide proof-of-principle that targeted gene induction via RNAa in conjunction with current
delivery platforms may represent a novel approach to treat
bladder cancer.
Two previous studies in mice have reported the antitumor
effects of siRNA delivered intravesically by targeting PLK1 and
survivin (33, 34). Because these studies used only a limited
number of animals, tumor burden served as the primary
end point. To assess treatment efﬁcacy, we opted to use animal
survival as the primary end point, whereas monitoring tumor
response by BLS throughout the study. To achieve sufﬁcient
statistical power, we used a large population containing 29
animals with established orthotopic bladder tumors (9 to 10
mice/group). In fact, this study currently represents the largest
cohort of animals ever used to evaluate small RNA-based
therapeutics in an orthotopic bladder cancer model. We
observed that intravesical delivery of LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
caused regression/disappearance of tumors in 40% of the
treated mice and signiﬁcantly prolonged animal survival compared with control groups. As such, LNP-dsP21-322-20 F may
represent a putative intravesical drug for treating bladder
cancer and controlling recurrence.
KU-7 cells have been used to establish orthotopic bladder
tumors in immunocompromised mice (26, 35). A previous
study indicated that KU-7 tumors are conﬁned to the lamina
propria within 4 weeks (35); however, we observed muscle
invasion at longer periods of observation (4 weeks). In some
instances, metastases were found in the kidney, which most
likely resulted from retrograde migration of the instilled tumor
cells. Such metastases also seemed to evade treatment delivered locally to the bladder. In our hands, KU-7 cells not only
modeled superﬁcial bladder cancer, but also recapitulated
muscle-invasive and metastatic disease.
The target site of dsP21-322 is not shared between mouse
and human due to poor conservation of p21 promoter
sequence (36). As such, it is currently unknown whether p21
induction by dsP21-322-20 F poses adverse effects to the normal
bladder epithelium in humans. RNAa is a bias mechanism of
gene overexpression in which some cell lines/types can be
resistant to saRNA treatment. In some cases, highly downregulated genes are more sensitive to gene activation. Because
p21 is associated with reduced expression in bladder cancer
(20, 21), it may possess an innate susceptibility to RNAa;
whereas normal bladder cells may be more resilient to p21
induction by dsP21-322-20 F. In this regard, LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
may possess an inherent bias toward disease tissue. Nonetheless, further evaluation of dsP21-322-20 F needs to be done to
identify its effects on normal tissue health.

Intravesical administration of small RNA drugs has the
advantage of bringing high concentrations of drug into direct
contact with diseased tissue without the side effects associated
with systemic drug administration. The dosing schedule used
in our study mirrors current treatment regimens for intravesical immunotherapy Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which
is used to treat superﬁcial and recurrent bladder cancer in
humans. Furthermore, we used a clinically relevant unilamellar
LNP to improve the bioavailability of dsP21-322-20 F. LNP-formulation drastically enhanced dsP21-322-20 F stability in urine
and capacity to penetrate the protective glycosaminoglycan
(GAG) layer of the bladder delivering duplex to the underlying
urothelial cells. In summary, we show that LNP-dsP21-322-20 F
has antitumor activity in an orthotopic model of bladder cancer
by elevating p21 levels in vivo. Our results provide preclinical
proof-of-concept that DLin-KC2-DMA-based nanoparticles
have application in delivering RNA duplexes to facilitate RNAa
in vivo, as well as deﬁne a candidate RNAa-based drug for the
treatment of regional bladder cancer that may have clinical
relevance as an adjuvant therapy after TUR.
