Abstract
No clinically validated biomarkers exist to image tumor responses to antiangiogenic therapy. Here, we report
the utility of hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect the early effects of anti-VEGF
therapy. In two colorectal cancer xenograft models, displaying differential sensitivity to VEGF blockade, we
compared hyperpolarized MRS with measurements of tumor perfusion using dynamic contrast agent–enhanced
(DCE)-MRI and tumor cellularity using diffusion-weighted MRI of the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) of
tissue water. In tumors sensitive to anti-VEGF therapy, 13C ﬂux between hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and
[1-13C]lactate decreased after anti-VEGF therapy and correlated with reduced perfusion. Production of
[1,4-13C2]malate from hyperpolarized [1,4-13C2]fumarate increased in parallel with tumor cell necrosis, preceding
any change in tumor ADC. In contrast, tumors that were less sensitive to anti-VEGF therapy showed an increase in
13
C ﬂux from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and an increase in uptake of a gadolinium contrast agent, whereas
tumor ADC decreased. Increased label ﬂux could be explained by vascular normalization after VEGF blockade,
increasing delivery of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate as observed. Despite the minimal response of these tumors
to treatment, with only a minor increase in necrosis observed histologically, production of [1,4-13C2]malate from
hyperpolarized [1,4-13C2]fumarate in therapy-resistant tumors also increased. Together, our ﬁndings show that
hyperpolarized 13C MRS detects early responses to anti-VEGF therapy, including vascular normalization or
vascular destruction and cell death. Cancer Res; 72(4); 854–64. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from surrounding host vasculature, can be a rate limiting process in
tumor development and progression. VEGF is a key proangiogenic factor that stimulates endothelial cell proliferation,
migration, and survival. Sustained and excessive exposure of
tumors to angiogenic factors, including VEGF, leads to a
chaotic neovasculature, composed of immature blood vessels
that are often tortuous and highly permeable (1). Targeting the
tumor vasculature is an attractive treatment option, with
antiangiogenic agents providing a means not only to prune
immature vessels but also to induce a window of "vascular
normalization" before ultimately reducing the tumor vasculature to inadequacy (2).
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF and
blocks signal transduction through the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2

receptors (3). In the preclinical setting, treatment with bevacizumab leads to sustained changes in vascular function,
including reduced microvessel density (MVD) and permeability (4). These changes have also been reproduced in clinical
trials (5, 6) within 24 hours of VEGF blockade (7) but are often
transient, rather than sustained, and frequently reverse upon
cessation of treatment (2, 8). The most promising results in the
clinic have been observed by combining bevacizumab with
conventional cytotoxic therapy (8), in which a 5-month
increase in overall survival in metastatic colorectal cancer
patients (9) led to the ﬁrst U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval in 2004. Bevacizumab was subsequently approved for
treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (10), non–smallcell lung cancer (11), and glioblastoma (12). However, this
success has recently been confounded by results in metastatic
breast cancer, in which accelerated approval (13) was
rescinded after 2 subsequent studies failed to show the same
improvement in overall survival (14).
The rapid adoption of bevacizumab in the clinic has led to an
urgent need to develop biomarkers that can select patients that
will best respond to the therapy, direct drug dose, and sensitively detect response to treatment (15–17); such biomarkers
have remained elusive (14). Dynamic contrast agent–enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) of the tumor vasculature has proved promising in this regard (17), with patients whose tumors undergo a
50% or greater reduction in contrast agent uptake within the
ﬁrst cycle of treatment usually attaining stable or better

Hyperpolarized 13C Detects Early Response to Bevacizumab

disease (18). However, a correlation of DCE-MRI with clinical
outcome has yet to be established (19). Although the effects of
bevacizumab on tumor vasculature are relatively well characterized, the secondary effects on tumor metabolism are largely
unknown. The interplay between tumor vascularity and
metabolism is of signiﬁcant interest, as high glucose metabolism with low blood ﬂow correlates with poorer patient
outcomes (20, 21). The glycolytic phenotype of tumor xenografts was recently found to play a role in the response of
preclinical tumor models to anti-VEGF therapy (22). Furthermore, metabolic changes measured with proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in glioblastoma multiforme
tumors treated with cediranib are highly predictive of 6-month
overall survival (23). Taken together, these observations suggest that imaging of both tumor vascularity and metabolism
may provide important insights into the status of the tumor
microenvironment following VEGF blockade (24).
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP, or "hyperpolarization")
of 13C-labeled metabolic substrates is an emerging technique
that dramatically enhances the sensitivity of the 13C-MRS
experiment (25). We have shown previously, in a preclinical
lymphoma model, that 13C MRS with hyperpolarized
[1-13C]pyruvate and [1,4-13C2]fumarate sensitively detects early changes in tumor metabolism following administration of a
vascular disrupting agent (26). Flux of hyperpolarized 13C label
between pyruvate and lactate is sensitive to tumor perfusion,
membrane transport of pyruvate, endogenous lactate concentration, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (27), whereas the production of labeled malate from fumarate has been
shown to be a sensitive indicator of tumor cell necrosis (28). In
this study, we show that hyperpolarized 13C MRS can detect the
early effects of antiangiogenic therapy in 2 colorectal cancer
xenograft models (LoVo and HT29) that are known to display
differential response to VEGF blockade, being more and less
sensitive, respectively (29–31). Furthermore, we compare these
results with those obtained using functional MRI techniques
that are used currently in the clinic, as the ﬁrst clinical trial of
hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate is now underway (32). Our
results suggest that hyperpolarized 13C MRS not only conﬁrms
results from functional MRI but also provides additional
insight that helps to differentiate responding tumors from
nonresponders following VEGF blockade.

Materials and Methods
Animal preparation and treatment
Tumors were established in female severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice by subcutaneous injection of 5  106 LoVo or
HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. LoVo and HT29
cells of the same passage were genotyped with the AmpFISTR
Kit (Applied Biosciences) and were a 90% and 100% match with
American Type Culture Collection standards, respectively. The
cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Cell
Cultures (LoVo, catalog no. 8706101; HT29, catalog no.
91072201). Drug-treated animals received bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche) at 5 mg/kg twice weekly (4, 9). Drug dosing was
carried out on day 1 and 3, after baseline imaging on day 0; time
points referred to in this study are 24 hours following each drug

administration (24 and 72 hours). Procedures were conducted
in accordance with project and personal licenses issued under
the United Kingdom Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act, 1986.
MRI
Animals were anesthetized with 10 mL/kg of a 5:4:31 mixture
of Hypnorm (VetaPharma Ltd.), Hypnovel (Roche) and saline.
A catheter was inserted into a tail vein and the animal was
positioned in a cradle, which was placed in a quadrature 1Htuned volume coil (Varian) in a 9.4T vertical wide-bore magnet
(Oxford Instruments). The body temperature of the animals
was maintained using a ﬂow of warm air. For hyperpolarized
experiments, a 24-mm diameter surface coil tuned to 13C (100
MHz) was positioned over the tumor. In all experiments,
transverse 1H "pilot" images were acquired for tumor localization using a spin-echo pulse sequence [repetition time (TR),
500 milliseconds; echo time (TE), 10 milliseconds; ﬁeld-of-view
(FOV), 35  35 mm2 in a data matrix of 256  256; 21 slices of
thickness 2 mm]. All data analysis was done using custom
routines written in MATLAB (MathWorks).
Hyperpolarized 13C. [1-13C]pyruvic acid and [1,4-13C2]fumaric acid (99% 13C; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were
hyperpolarized as described previously (26, 28, 33). Samples
were polarized in a GE Healthcare DNP prototype hyperpolarizer for 45 minutes before dissolution in 6 mL of buffer (26).
Final concentrations were 75 mmol/L for pyruvate and 20
mmol/L for fumarate, with polarizations in the range of 20% to
30%. A slice-selective excitation "pulse and acquire" sequence
was used for 13C spectroscopy following injection of 0.2 mL of
hyperpolarized substrate. The slice, which was 6 mm thick, was
placed within the subcutaneous tumors, which protruded
above the body of the animal and into the surface coil loop.
There was minimal inclusion of underlying tissue. Treatment
with bevacizumab was started at the same time after tumor cell
implantation (15 days). Because the HT29 tumors grew slightly
faster than the LoVo tumors, this meant that the MR measurements and treatment with bevacizumab were initiated when
the tumors had slightly different sizes (Length  Width ¼ 88 
16 mm2 and 138  18 mm2 for LoVo and HT29, respectively).
For hyperpolarized pyruvate, 160 13C spectra were acquired at
1-second intervals with a nominal ﬂip angle of 10 degrees.
Approximately 1 hour after the pyruvate experiment, hyperpolarized fumarate was injected into the same animal, and
following a delay of 20 seconds to allow production of
hyperpolarized malate, 32 spectra were acquired from the
same tumor slice at 5-second intervals with a nominal ﬂip
angle of 60 degrees. The integrated peak intensities of
hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate were ﬁtted to the modiﬁed Bloch equations for 2-site exchange to
obtain apparent rate constants for ﬂux of label from pyruvate to lactate (kP) and the reverse ﬂux (kL), assuming equal
spin lattice relaxation rates (1/T1) for both metabolites. The
rate constant kP was shown previously to be a robust
measure of pyruvate–lactate exchange, regardless of the
assumptions that were made in the process of data ﬁtting
(26). Given the relatively low level of [1,4-13C2]malate
detected in the fumarate experiments, the ratio of malate
to fumarate in the ﬁrst spectrum (25 seconds postinjection)

was used as a metric, as this was found to be an equivalent
marker of response in previous work (26).
Dynamic contrast–enhanced imaging. DCE-MRI data
were acquired as described previously (26) using a T1-weighted
spin-echo pulse sequence. Spin-lattice relaxation rates (R1 ¼ 1/
T1) were measured using an inversion recovery fast low angle
shot (FLASH) pulse sequence; one R1 map, and 6 baseline
images were collected precontrast. Gd3þ-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; 200 mmol/kg; Magnevist, Schering)
was diluted in sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and
injected as a bolus through a tail vein catheter over 2 to 3
seconds. Dynamic imaging was done for 10 minutes postinjection. Inversion recovery data were ﬁtted, pixel-by-pixel, to a
monoexponential function and spin-echo images were converted to relaxation rate maps (26). The Gd3þ-DTPA concentration curve was evaluated in all tumor-containing slices with
a manually delineated region of interest (ROI), and the integrated area under the curve up to 60 (AUC60) or 600 seconds
was calculated for each ROI (34, 35). Data shown are from the
central slice through the tumor, to avoid artifacts from skin
perfusion in the outer slice and ﬂow within the torso in the
inner slice.
Diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging. The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) of tissue water was mapped using
diffusion weighted MRIs (DW-MRI), acquired with a navigated
dual-echo spin-echo pulse sequence, as described previously
(26), in 9 slices of 2 mm thickness. Diffusion-sensitizing gradients equivalent to b-values of 0, 68, 271, 609, and 1,082 s/mm2
were applied along the slice axis (gradient length q, 7.5 milliseconds; delay between gradients D, 13 milliseconds). The
spin–spin relaxation time, T2, was then mapped using a
dual-echo spin-echo pulse sequence for TE values of 10, 20,
30, 40, and 50 milliseconds (FOV, 35  35 mm2; data matrix, 128
 128; TR, 1.0 seconds; 9 slices, thickness 2 mm). ADC and T2
maps were generated for each slice on a pixel-by-pixel basis
(26). Histograms were generated for each tumor-containing
slice, inside a manually deﬁned ROI just inside the tumor
boundary, as well as for the whole tumor; the mean, median,
and SD of the ADC and T2 values were recorded.
Ex vivo analysis
Biochemical assays. Tumors were freeze clamped 30
seconds after intravenous injection of a 0.2-mL bolus containing 75 mmol/L pyruvate and 20 mmol/L fumarate. Freezeclamped tumors were used to determine, spectrophotometrically, LDH (EC1.1.1.27) and fumarase (EC4.2.1.2) activities, and
tumor concentrations of pyruvate and lactate (26, 36). Citrate
synthase (EC2.3.3.1) activity was determined according to
Srere (37). Brieﬂy, tissue was homogenized on ice in a Teflon-glass Potter-S homogenizer in extraction buffer (20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 40 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L
EGTA and EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged to remove
cell debris, extracted with 1% Triton X-100 then centrifuged
again; the supernatant was removed and assayed immediately at 405 nm in a DTNB-linked assay.
Histology. Tumors excised post mortem were ﬁxed in 10%
formalin and parafﬁn embedded. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining was done for assessment of cell death. CD31

antibody (BD Pharmingen) and Jackson Biotinylated anti-rat
secondary antibody (Stratech) were used with the Bond
Intense R Detection kit (VisionBioSystems) for immunohistochemistry. Slides were scanned using an AperioXT (Aperio
Technologies), and quantitative analysis was done using ImageScope v10.2 software. For H&E stained slides, the fractional
area containing fragmented nuclei of dead cells in 2 slices per
tumor was measured. For CD31-stained slides, the Microvessel
Analysis algorithm v1.0 was integrated into the ImageScope
software, and the measurement parameters were optimized to
evaluate MVD and perimeter in ﬁve 1 mm2 ﬁelds of view in at
least one slice from each tumor. A minimum of 4 tumors were
analyzed at each treatment time point, which equated to a
minimum number of vessels for analysis of 1,692 and 540 for
LoVo and HT29 tumors, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SE unless stated otherwise.
All experiments were repeated independently in at least 3
animals. Statistical signiﬁcance was tested using Prism
(Graphpad) with a 2-tailed t test at the 95% conﬁdence level
(unpaired unless repeated measures) or 1-way ANOVA.

Results
Intravenous administration of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate resulted in readily detectable signals from both
[1-13C]pyruvate at 173 ppm and [1-13C]lactate at 185 ppm
(Fig. 1). The differences in signal-to-noise in these spectra
reﬂected differences in the levels of polarization. The ﬂux of 13C
label between these species decreased in LoVo tumors following treatment with bevacizumab (Fig. 1A), whereas it continued to increase after treatment in HT29 tumors (Fig. 1B). For
LoVo tumors, the apparent rate constant describing label ﬂux
between pyruvate and lactate (kP) was reduced by 50% at 24
hours (0.031  0.001 vs. 0.063  0.007/s pretreatment, P ¼ 0.03)
and was maintained at this level at 72 hours (0.039  0.005/s;
P ¼ 0.03 vs. pretreatment, P ¼ 0.34 vs. 24 hours; Fig. 1C). In
HT29 tumors, kP instead tended to increase over the time
course (0.025  0.006/s, pretreatment; 0.043  0.011/s, 24
hours; 0.049  0.024/s, 72 hours; Fig. 1D). On the basis of
tumor size changes, neither tumor type would be considered to
have responded over the treatment time course, as neither
displayed a reduction in tumor size [LoVo: Length  Width ¼
105  20 mm2 at 72 hours (day 5) vs. 88  16 mm2 pretreatment
(day 0), P ¼ 0.1; HT29: 164  20 mm2 at 72 hours (day 5) vs. 138
 18 mm2 pretreatment (day 0), P < 0.001]. However, the
growth curves for the drug-treated and vehicle-treated tumors
showed that both had responded to bevacizumab treatment,
although this response was greater for the LoVo as compared
with the HT29 tumors (Fig. 2).
The fumarase-catalyzed hydration of hyperpolarized
[1,4-13C2]fumarate (177 ppm) to [1,4-13C2]malate (182, 184
ppm), which was barely detectable before treatment, was seen
to increase following treatment in both tumor models (Fig. 3).
In the LoVo tumors (Fig. 3A), the ratio of malate to fumarate
at 25 seconds postinjection was 0.04  0.01 before treatment
and rose dramatically (>10-fold) after treatment to 0.49  0.04

(P ¼ 0.03) at 24 hours and 0.32  0.14 (P ¼ 0.01) at 72 hours (the
difference observed between 24 and 72 hours values was not
signiﬁcant; P ¼ 0.49). The ratio in the HT29 tumors was much
lower than that of the LoVo tumors (Fig. 3B) but still increased
over the treatment time course (0.010  0.004 at 24 hours, 0.047
 0.003 at 72 hours vs. 0.002  0.001 pretreatment, P < 0.05;
no signiﬁcant difference between the 24 and 72 hours values;
Fig. 3C and D).
Treatment response was also assessed using clinical MRI
methods. For DCE-MRI measurements, changes in perfusion
were assessed from the integrated area under the Gd-DTPA
uptake curve (AUC) at 60 and 600 seconds. Drug treatment of
LoVo tumors produced signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) antivascular
effects at 24 hours (Fig. 4A and B), with AUC60 falling from
0.52  0.09 to 0.25  0.04 mmol/L and AUC600 from 6.4  0.4 to
4.9  0.5 mmol/L. By 72 hours, there was some recovery, with
AUC60 rising to 0.35  0.07 and AUC600 to 7.0  0.5 mmol/L. By
contrast, no antivascular effects were observed in the HT29
tumors; in fact, there was evidence for increased contrast agent
uptake after treatment (Fig. 4C). The AUC60 remained close to
the pretreatment value of 0.67  0.09 mmol/L (0.59  0.12 and
0.58  0.10 mmol/L at 24 and 72 hours, respectively), but there
was a signiﬁcant increase at later time points in the Gd-DTPA
uptake curve (Fig. 4C), with the AUC600 (Fig. 4D) increasing
from 10.0  0.7 to 12.6  1.1 mmol/L at 24 hours (P < 0.05) and

14.0  1.6 mmol/L at 72 hours (P < 0.05). We observed a similar
differential response with MRI measurements of Gd-DTPA
uptake in a previous study, in which these tumors were treated
with an antivascular drug (31). Drug-induced decreases in
vascular permeability could also affect the Gd-DTPA uptake
curves and the tumor uptake of a Gd-DTPA–albumin conjugate has been used previously to measure bevacizumabinduced changes in vascular permeability (38). However,
changes in tumor contrast observed with low molecular weight
contrast agents, such as the Gd-DTPA used here, are inﬂuenced
primarily by ﬂow (39), as opposed to vascular permeability, and
considering only the initial rate of contrast agent uptake
minimizes the effects of changes in permeability (40).
Maps of tumor ADC and the transverse relaxation time (T2)
were used to determine the mean and median values of these
parameters (Table 1). Average ADC histograms for each time
point are shown in Fig. 5. There was no signiﬁcant change in
the ADC or T2 of LoVo tumors following bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 5A–C, Table 1). HT29 tumors did not exhibit any
change in T2, but there was a 15% decrease in median ADC
(Table 1) and narrowing of the ADC histogram (Fig. 5D–F),
from (0.67  0.04)  103mm2/s to (0.57  0.03)  103mm2/s

Figure 2. Growth curves for LoVo and HT29 tumors over the course of
treatment with bevacizumab. Day 0 is the ﬁrst day of imaging in untreated
animals. Tumors were ﬁrst treated on day 1; the growth of treated tumors
is represented by dashed lines. Both tumor types exhibit growth inhibition
with bevacizumab, although this is more pronounced for LoVo than HT29
tumors. The error bar for treated LoVo tumors on day 5 is within the
symbol representing the data point.

LoVo tumor samples revealed a transient increase in lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of more than 20% at 24 hours,
from 2.3  0.2 to 2.8  0.1 mmole/min/mg protein (P ¼ 0.03),
followed by a return to baseline at 72 hours (2.1  0.4 mmole/
min/mg protein; Fig. 6A). There was also an increase in lactate

concentration, which rose by 30% from 4.2  0.4 to 5.6  0.5
mmol/g (wet weight) at 24 hours (P ¼ 0.08) and by a further 30%
to 7.1  0.4 mmol/g at 72 hours (P < 0.01; Fig. 6B). These changes
in LDH activity and lactate concentration were consistent with
an increase in hypoxia in the LoVo tumors (29, 41). There was
no change in fumarase activity from the pretreatment level of
0.40  0.04 mmole/min/mg protein (Fig. 6C). The tumor
pyruvate concentration tended to decrease (Fig. 6D), and this
was signiﬁcant at 72 hours (0.30  0.06 mmol/g vs. 0.43  0.03
mmol/g pretreatment; P ¼ 0.04), in part, reﬂecting the reduced
tumor perfusion observed in DCE-MRI measurements.
By contrast, the HT29 tumor extracts showed no signiﬁcant
changes in tumor lactate concentration (pretreatment level,
8.6  0.4 mmol/g), pyruvate concentration (0.36  0.02 mmol/g),
or LDH activity (1.8  0.2 mmole/min/mg protein), although
the pretreatment lactate level was approximately double that
found in LoVo tumors (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, fumarase activity
decreased by approximately 50%, from 0.19  0.04 mmole/min/
mg protein pretreatment, to 0.10  0.04 and 0.08  0.03 mmole/
min/mg protein at 24 and 72 hours, respectively (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 6C). As fumarase exists in both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms, we also measured the activity of a mitochondrial
marker enzyme, citrate synthase; this fell by approximately
20% in HT29 tumors, from 0.12  0.01 to 0.10  0.01 mmole/
min/mg protein at 72 hours, but the change was not signiﬁcant
(P ¼ 0.13).
Histologic assessment of tumor sections obtained post
mortem showed that both tumors contained small abnormal
or necrotic areas (Fig. 7A) by 24 hours after the ﬁrst drug
treatment (HT29, 8  1%, LoVo, 14  3%), with a low level of
necrosis in untreated tumors (HT29, 5  1%; LoVo, 9  1%). At
72 hours, the necrotic area had increased substantially in LoVo
tumors (26  2%; P < 0.001), although it remained diffuse

the gadolinium uptake curve (AUC) at

throughout the tumor. This was not the case in HT29 tumors
(10  3% at 72 hours; P ¼ 0.68). CD31 staining of tumor blood
vessels (Fig. 7B) showed that in LoVo tumors, vessel density
declined by 40%, from (2.1  0.4)  104/mm2 to (1.2  0.1) 
104/mm2 at 24 hours (P ¼ 0.03) and further to (0.8  0.1) 
104/mm2 at 72 hours (P < 0.001). There was no signiﬁcant
change in vessel density in HT29 tumors from the pretreatment
level of (0.5  0.1)  104/mm2. Vessel perimeter in the
untreated LoVo tumor sections was 63.6  0.7 mm, signiﬁcantly
larger than that in HT29 tumor sections (43.9  1.5 mm; P <
0.001), which is consistent with a higher level of VEGF expression in these tumors. The perimeter of LoVo tumor vessels
declined after treatment to 59.2  4.5 mm at 24 hours and 54.8
 2.1 mm at 72 hours (P ¼ 0.03), but no change was observed in
the perimeter of HT29 tumor vessels (43.0  2.0 and 48.7  4.4

Discussion
The early success of bevacizumab in improving progressionfree survival has been marred by more recent failures to show
signiﬁcant improvements in overall survival. The recent introduction of hyperpolarized 13C MRSI into the clinic (32) offers a
new way to investigate the action of these drugs and to detect
response to them. In this preclinical study, we sought to detect
early metabolic and vascular changes induced by bevacizumab
treatment in 2 colorectal cancer xenograft models with differential sensitivity to VEGF blockade. LoVo tumors display a
higher dependence on VEGF, with greater vessel permeability
(31) and lower vessel pericyte coverage (29) than HT29 tumors,
therefore upon VEGF blockade will exhibit reduced MVD and
perfusion, along with marked expansion of hypoxic regions
(29). Conversely, HT29 tumor cells are less sensitive to VEGF

a

blockade (30), requiring high doses of bevacizumab (42) or
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (43) to display a similar
response. We have shown here that the growth of these tumors
has differential sensitivity to VEGF blockade and that this
differential response can be detected early during treatment by
MR measurements of metabolism, vascular function, and the
ADC of tissue water. These measured changes in tumor
biochemistry and physiology occur in the absence of a decrease
in tumor size, and in HT29 tumors, precede a signiﬁcant
change in tumor growth rate.
Our ﬁrst key ﬁnding is that hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate
and [1,4-13C2]fumarate are early markers of a positive response
to bevacizumab treatment in LoVo tumors. The apparent
rate constant describing label exchange between [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate, kP, fell by more than 50% at 24
hours after treatment. This rate constant can be inﬂuenced by
several factors, including LDH activity, the concentrations of
the coenzymes NADþ and NADH, as well as pyruvate delivery
and transport (33). Tumor lactate concentration and LDH

activity, measured by biochemical assays, both increased
signiﬁcantly, which can be attributed to an increase in tumor
hypoxia following VEGF blockade and consequent HIF-1–
dependent upregulation of glycolytic enzyme expression,
including LDH (41). Because both the increase in lactate
concentration and LDH activity are expected to produce nearly
proportional increases in label ﬂux between pyruvate and
lactate (27), the decrease in label ﬂux is most likely due to
the decrease in tumor perfusion observed in the DCE-MRI
measurements, which will result in reduced pyruvate delivery
to the tumor (26). The DCE-MRI measurements showed a 52%
reduction in AUC60 at 24 hours after treatment, which recovered a little, to 67% of the pretreatment level, by 72 hours (Fig.
4). The reduction in perfusion at 72 hours was accompanied by
a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in tumor pyruvate concentration, which was measured 30 seconds after intravenous
pyruvate injection (Fig. 6). However, the continued suppression of label ﬂux at 72 hours may also reﬂect cell death as the
percentage of tumor necrosis had reached a signiﬁcant

Figure 5. ADC histograms averaged
over all measurements at each time
point. No signiﬁcant change was
seen in the median ADC value or
histogram shape following
bevacizumab treatment of LoVo
tumors (A) after 24 (B) or 72 hours
(C). A signiﬁcant reduction in the
median ADC and narrowing of the
ADC histogram of the HT29 tumors
(D–F) is observed within 24 hours of
treatment (E) with bevacizumab
and maintained at 72 hours (F).

increase above baseline by this time point. The tumor MVD fell
60% by 72 hours relative to pretreatment levels, whereas the
vessel perimeter declined by nearly 15%; histologic changes of
this nature are consistent with a positive response to bevacizumab (1).
The production of labeled malate from hyperpolarized
[1,4-13C2]fumarate has been shown previously to be a sensitive
indicator of tumor cell necrosis (28). This has been shown in
vitro and in vivo in different tumor types, using both cytotoxic
and antivascular drugs (26, 28). In the LoVo tumors, the
hyperpolarized malate/fumarate ratio increased by more than
10-fold after bevacizumab treatment. The increased malate
production reﬂected an increase in necrotic fraction observed
in histologic sections, which increased to 26% by the 72 hours
time point. The decline in the malate/fumarate ratio observed
at 72 hours, although not signiﬁcant, may reﬂect some washout
of fumarase from necrotic areas. There was no signiﬁcant
change in DW-MRI measurements of tumor ADC, when considering either the median value or histograms of the distribution of ADC values (Table 1 and Fig. 5A–C). The lack of change in
tumor ADC is consistent with previous observations that in
xenograft tumors with small or diffuse regions of necrosis, there
may be no change in ADC with necrotic fractions of up to 40%
(44). This shows the sensitivity of the hyperpolarized fumarate
experiment for detecting diffuse tumor cell necrosis.
Our second key ﬁnding is that in the less sensitive HT29
tumors, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate is affected by vascular
normalization induced by bevacizumab treatment. Although
histopathology showed no signiﬁcant change in MVD or vessel
perimeter in these tumors, the apparent rate constant for label
exchange between [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate, kP,
increased 2.2-fold after bevacizumab treatment. Because there
was no change in lactate concentration or LDH activity, this
increase in rate was most likely due to increased pyruvate

www.aacrjournals.org

delivery to the tumor. This is supported by the Gd-DTPA
uptake data, although there was no change in Gd-DTPA uptake
over the ﬁrst 60 seconds following contrast agent injection
(AUC60), which covers the time course of the hyperpolarized
experiment (160 seconds, Fig. 1), there was nevertheless a
signiﬁcant increase in AUC600.
That the vascular normalization resulting from VEGF blockade can result in increased delivery of small molecules to
tumors has been shown in previous studies. Treatment of a
range of tumor xenografts (including colorectal cancer) with
an antibody to VEGFR-2 was shown to decrease interstitial
ﬂuid pressure (IFP), by improving the integrity and function of
the vasculature, which resulted in signiﬁcantly enhanced
penetration of small molecules (45). Treatment of neuroblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab increased the penetration
of a chemotherapeutic drug for 1 to 3 days after drug treatment
(46), and a similar observation was made in HT29 tumors (47).
A reduction in IFP may explain the increase in AUC600 observed
here because a negative correlation has been observed between
AUC and IFP in cervical cancer, thought to be due to high IFP
resulting in increased resistance to tumor blood ﬂow (48). The
failure to detect increased pyruvate concentrations in the
HT29 tumors following bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 6) may
be a reﬂection of the fact that 30 seconds after pyruvate
injection, most of the pyruvate is still in the tumor blood
vessels (49). Furthermore, the decrease in median tumor ADC
and narrowing of the ADC histogram observed here (Fig. 5) has
been observed previously after anti-VEGF treatment in both
preclinical (22) and clinical (23, 50) studies, in which it has been
attributed to a variety of factors, including cell swelling (22),
atypical necrosis, and chronic hypoxia (50), as well as
decreased edema (23).
The magnitude of the change in kP is greater than the
changes in either ADC or AUC; therefore, the hyperpolarized

pyruvate experiment is better able to detect not only the
antivascular effects in the LoVo tumors but is also more
sensitive to vascular normalization in the HT29 tumor, which
may provide an avenue to improve scheduling of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with antiangiogenic drugs.
There was little or no signal from hyperpolarized
[1,4-13C2]malate in HT29 tumors prior to treatment, but a
signiﬁcant increase was observed following treatment,
despite only a relatively minor increase in necrotic area in
these tumors and a decrease in fumarase activity. This shows
again the sensitivity of the hyperpolarized fumarate experiment for detecting low levels of diffuse necrosis by integrating malate signal over the entire tumor volume. These
low levels of necrosis were not detected by either the T2 or
DW-MRI measurements. The decrease in fumarase activity
reﬂected, at least in part, a decrease in mitochondrial
content, as assessed by measurements of citrate synthase
activity. Fumarase exists in both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms, so the membrane disruption that occurs early in
the process of necrosis may lead to leakage of the cytosolic
form, also causing a reduction in the measured fumarase
activity.
In conclusion, we have shown that hyperpolarized 13C MRS
sensitively detects early response to antiangiogenic therapy.
Although DCE-MRI detects evidence of vascular changes, it

862

cannot determine the downstream effects on tumor metabolism, in which the hyperpolarized pyruvate experiment has
the advantage of being sensitive to both perfusion and
metabolic changes. In therapies that produce diffuse, lowlevel necrosis, in which there is no signiﬁcant change in ADC,
the production of malate from hyperpolarized fumarate is
still elevated. However, there is clearly an advantage in
combining both the metabolic and functional MRI
approaches, for example, the early increase in label ﬂux
following treatment of HT29 tumors could be explained
either by vascular normalization increasing pyruvate delivery
to the tumor or an increase in steady-state lactate concentration (27), alternatives which can be resolved by the DCEMRI experiment. Therefore, the use of hyperpolarized
[1-13C]pyruvate and [1,4-13C2]fumarate to detect metabolic
response to treatment should prove advantageous, in the
clinical assessment of response to antiangiogenic therapies.
