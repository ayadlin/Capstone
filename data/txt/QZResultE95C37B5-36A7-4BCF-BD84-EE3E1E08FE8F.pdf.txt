BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that several inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) can enhance chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis and reduce sarcoma tumor volume in preclinical models. The authors sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose,
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety, and toxicity of the HDAC inhibitor abexinostat (PCI-24781) when administered with
doxorubicin to patients with metastatic sarcomas. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a standard, phase 1, 3 1 3, dose-escalation
study design. Abexinostat was administered on days 1 through 5 with 75 mg/m2 of doxorubicin administered on day 4 of every 21day cycle until patients developed disease progression or drug intolerance or reached a cumulative lifetime doxorubicin dose of
450 mg/m2. Granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF) support was provided at physician discretion on arm A and was provided
to all participants in arm B. From 3 to 6 participants initially received abexinostat 30 mg/m2 twice daily, and subsequent cohorts
were administered doses of 15 mg/m2, 45 mg/m2, or 60 mg/m2 twice daily. All patients without progressive disease after receiving a
cumulative lifetime doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2 were given the option to continue with abexinostat as a single agent until they
developed disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 22 participants (10 who had previously experienced tumor growth after doxorubicin therapy) were enrolled (6 in arm A, 14 in arm B), 20 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and 17 were evaluable for
radiologic response. In arm A, participants received abexinostat 15 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2 twice daily. DLTs of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were observed in 2 of 3 participants who received abexinostat 30 mg/m2 twice daily. Neither of those patients received G-CSF
prophylaxis. In arm B, participants received abexinostat at doses of 30 mg/m2, 45 mg/m2, or 60 mg/m2 twice daily, all with mandated
G-CSF support. Two DLTs were observed at the 60 mg/m2 twice-daily dose (grade 3 infection, grade 4 thrombocytopenia). The pharmacokinetics of abexinostat were not affected by doxorubicin. HDAC activity, as measured by histone acetylation in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, was maximally inhibited at the abexinostat 30 mg/m2 twice-daily dose. Of the 17 participants who were evaluable
for radiologic response, 1 patient had a partial response, 9 patients had stable disease, and 7 patients had progressive disease as their
best response; and 8 patients completed 5 cycles. Three of those participants had stable disease as their most recent disease status
when the current report was written. Four participants who continued on monotherapy remained in stable disease for a median of
9.8 weeks after completing doxorubicin. The most common toxicities were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. No study-related
deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose for abexinostat was 45 mg/m2 twice daily administered on days
1 through 5 when patients received doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 on day 4 of a 3-week cycle and G-CSF support was mandated. Toxicities
were manageable, and tumor responses were observed. Additional studies are needed to further define the specific contributions of

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous family of cancers that arise in the body’s connective tissues and represent a diverse
group of histologic subtypes, with 80% of soft tissue origin and the remainder of bone origin.1 It is estimated that there
will be approximately 11,410 new cases of sarcoma this year in the United States and 4390 deaths.1,2 The aggressive sarcomas frequently present or recur as metastatic or inoperable disease and are difficult to cure with conventional therapies.
These tumors can have modest rates of response to doxorubicin, which is the current standard therapy for metastatic

sarcomas; however, >50% of treated patients are refractory at disease onset and exhibit progressively lower rates
of response with subsequent lines of therapy, leading to
eventual and certain death.3
Available therapies for sarcomas include cytotoxic
chemotherapy given either as a single agent or combined
with 1 or more other agent(s), surgery, and/or radiotherapy, as clinically appropriate.4 Once patients with sarcoma recur or present with distant metastasis, the median
survival is approximately 12 months.5 Treatment with the
most effective chemotherapeutic agents for sarcoma yields
objective response rates of 20% to 30%, with an average
time to progression of <6 months. Therefore, most sarcomas either do not respond or quickly develop resistance to
chemotherapy. Several strategies that have been used or
are being explored to enhance cytotoxic therapies or to
reverse drug resistance in other types of human cancers
include small-molecule drugs or nanoparticles that target
specific cellular signaling proteins or genes.4 Among these
targets are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.6-14
Classic HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat6 and valproate,7 exert a growth-inhibitory effect in sarcoma cell
lines. It also has been reported that these HDAC inhibitors can sensitize fibrosarcoma,11 osteosarcoma,13 and
chondrosarcoma14 cell lines to chemotherapy.
Abexinostat (PCI-24781) is a hydroxamic acid-based
HDAC inhibitor that was developed based on in vivo efficacy and an overall benign therapeutic index.15 More direct
evidence indicates that abexinostat enhances cytotoxicity
induced by doxorubicin in sarcoma cell lines. Yang et al
observed that combined abexinostat and doxorubicin was
effective in inhibiting the proliferation of sarcoma cell lines
that were resistant to doxorubicin alone.16,17 Lopez et al
observed superior antiproliferative effects when abexinostat
was used in combination with chemotherapy.18 When
abexinostat was administered parenterally to tumorbearing mice, significant tumor growth inhibition (approximately 50%-80%) was demonstrated at abexinostat doses
from 20 to 80 mg/kg (range, 60-240 mg/m2). We designed
the current dose-escalation study in humans to determine
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of abexinostat and to
elucidate its safety when combined with doxorubicin in
patients with sarcoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study protocol was approved by the Dana
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board and is registered on clinicaltrials.gov under the
National Library of Medicine identifier NCT01027910.
The treatment regimen consisted of abexinostat given
1224

orally twice daily for 5 days in combination with doxorubicin given intravenously on day 4 of every 21-day cycle.
A starting dose of abexinostat at 30 mg/m2 twice daily was
escalated or decreased in subsequent cohorts in increments of 15 mg/m2 to a maximum of 60 mg/m2 twice
daily. Participants continued with combined doxorubicin
and abexinostat up to a maximum of 6 cycles until they
had received a lifetime cumulative doxorubicin dose of
450 mg/m2.
Administration of abexinostat with doxorubicin was
discontinued for the following reasons: disease progression as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (version 1.1), participant reached a cumulative lifetime anthracycline dose of 450 mg/m2, intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study
drug, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1,
unacceptable adverse event(s), participant decided to
withdraw from the study, or general or specific changes in
the participant’s condition that rendered the participant
unacceptable for further administration of study drug in
the judgment of the investigator. All patients (including
those who discontinued early from protocol therapy) were
followed for at least 30 days after removal from study or
until death. Participants who were removed from the
study for unacceptable adverse events were followed until
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
Study participants were enrolled into 2 arms. Arm A
received abexinostat and doxorubicin with optional
granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.
Arm B received abexinostat and doxorubicin with G-CSF
support required for all participants. The study used a standard 3 1 3, phase 1, dose-escalation design. Three cohorts
comprised of 3 to 6 participants were enrolled in each arm,
and separate intercohort dose escalations were performed in
up to 3 cohorts of 3 to 6 participants enrolled sequentially
until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined
abexinostat and doxorubicin, without (arm A) or with (arm
B) mandatory G-CSF support, was established.
DLTs were evaluated on day 1 of cycle 2 and
included all adverse events experienced through cycle 1. A
DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring
during cycle 1: grade 3 or 4 toxicities involving prolongation of the QTc interval; vomiting not controlled by maximal supportive care measures; thrombocytopenia lasting
>7 days or associated with bleeding; or nonhematologic
toxicity except for alopecia, nausea, or vomiting; grade 4
toxicities involving thrombocytopenia, neutropenia lasting >5 days on growth factors; or any other toxicities that
caused failure to restart PCI-24781 administration within
2 weeks of the first missed dose. Participants had to

complete at least 2 cycles of abexinostat to be evaluable for
response.
Participants who were removed from the study during cycle 1 for reasons other than a predefined DLT were
replaced for the purpose of DLT evaluation. The
algorithm-based design of the phase 1 part of the study
was specified because of its practical simplicity and not
because of power considerations. A dose level was determined to be tolerable if none of the first 3 patients in that
cohort experienced a DLT. A dose level was determined
to have surpassed the MTD if 2 or more patients in a
cohort of 6 experienced a DLT. Because the study was for
a specific cohort, the probabilities of declaring a dose level
intolerable, given the various true occurrence rates for
DLTs, are presented in Table 1.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics assessment were
obtained and plasma samples were collected by centrifugation and shipped to Pharmacyclics (Sunnyvale, Calif) for
analysis. The plasma concentrations of abexinostat were
determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
with tandem mass spectrometric using validated assays.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) pellets
for pharmacodynamics assessment were obtained from
centrifugation of blood samples, frozen, and shipped to
Pharmacyclics for analysis. Proteins from the frozen
PBMC pellets were extracted by using AllPrep (Qiagen,
Valencia, Calif). Total protein (50 lg) was subjected to
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The gels were then blotted, and acetylated histones, acetylated tubulin, and total
tubulin levels were detected by standard Western blot
analyses. Acetylated histone Western blot analyses were
performed by using rabbit antiacetylated lysine antibody
(Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, Mass), mouse antiacetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Mo), mouse anti-a-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif), rabbit antiactin (Cell Signaling
Technology), and infrared dye (IR-Dye)-conjugated goatantimouse and IRDye-conjugated goat-antirabbit antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Neb). Bands were
imaged and quantified in the linear range using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
RESULTS
This study was opened to accrual on January 28, 2010
and closed to accrual on April 16, 2012. In total, 22 participants (10 who had previously experienced tumor
growth after doxorubicin therapy) were enrolled, 20 were
evaluable for DLT (6 in arm A, 14 in arm B), and 17 were
evaluable for radiologic response (Fig. 1), because patients

who experienced a DLT were removed from the study
before completing cycle 1. One patient withdrew consent
2 days after starting treatment; therefore, that patient’s
data were removed from analysis.
Table 2 displays patient demographics and other
characteristics at baseline. The median patient age was 54
years (range, 21-77 years), 95.2% of patients were white,
1 patient (4.8%) was in the “other” race category, 12
patients (57.1%) were men, and 9 (42.9%) were women.
Histologic tumor subtypes among participants were distributed as follows: 1 patient (4.8%) had liposarcoma, 5
(23.8%) had leiomyosarcoma, 2 (9.5%) had fibrosarcoma, 2 (9.5%) had synovial sarcoma, and 11 (52.4%)
had “other” sarcomas. One hundred percent of participants had metastatic sarcoma.
Because HDAC inhibitors, as a class, are known to
prolong the QTc interval, electrocardiograms (ECGs)
were performed before and after abexinostat administration to measure its effects on QTc interval. The results
from baseline and treatment ECGs are provided in Table
3. Patients who had QTc intervals 450 msec were
excluded from the study, as were patients who had other
significant ECG abnormalities, defined as second-degree
atrioventricular block type II, third-degree atrioventricular block, or bradycardia (ventricular rate <55 beats/minute). Patients who had any other ECG abnormalities
that were determined to be minor and clinically insignificant were allowed to enroll. No clinically significant
abnormalities were observed in this study. Compared
with baseline ECGs (81% of which had a normal result),
62.7% of all preabexinostat ECGs had a normal result,
53.5% of all ECGs performed 1 or 2 hours after the first
dose of abexinostat were normal, and 73.9% of all ECGs
performed 1 or 2 hours after the second dose of abexinostat were normal. The mean predose QTc interval rose to
428 msec (from a baseline mean of 425 msec), to 437
msec at 1 or 2 hours after the first dose, and to 427 msec
at 1 or 2 hours after the second dose.
A summary of grade 3 or greater treatment-related
adverse events is provided in Table 4 (event counts are
listed according to the worst grade for all 21 treated
patients). Four participants experienced DLTs as defined
according to the protocol. In arm A, participants received
abexinostat 15 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2 twice daily. DLTs of
grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were observed in 2 of 3 participants who received 30 mg/m2 twice daily. Neither of
those patients received G-CSF prophylaxis. No DLTs
were observed in participants who received abexinostat
15 mg/m2 twice daily. In arm B, participants were administered abexinostat at 30 mg/m2, 45 mg/m2, or 60 mg/m2

twice daily, all with mandated G-CSF support. Two
DLTs were observed at the 60 mg/m2 twice-daily dose
level (grade 3 infection and grade 4 thrombocytopenia).
No DLTs were observed in the participants who received
abexinostat 45 mg/m2 twice daily. Therefore, the MTD
of abexinostat when administered with 75 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and with required G-CSF support was 45 mg/
m2 twice daily.
The pharmacokinetics of abexinostat were not
affected by doxorubicin. HDAC activity, as measured by
histone acetylation in PBMCs, was maximally inhibited
at 30 mg/m2 twice daily (see Fig. 1). In the 17 participants

who were evaluable for radiologic response, a determination of stable disease (SD) as the best response was made if
the response at the end of the second cycle indicated SD,
unless the patient subsequently developed a partial
response. One patient had a partial response, 9 patients
had SD, and 7 patients had progressive disease as their
best response (Tables 5 and 6); and 8 patients completed
5 cycles (see Table 7). Four participants who continued
on monotherapy remained in SD for a median of 9.8
weeks after completing doxorubicin. The most common
toxicities were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
No study-related deaths were observed.

HDAC inhibitors can increase accessibility of cytotoxic
agents to DNA by altering chromatin structure, thereby
allowing DNA alkylating and intercalating agents to
interact with DNA more directly. It has been demonstrated in vitro that HDAC inhibition enhances the toxicity of several anticancer drugs that target DNA (eg,
etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin).16-18 Several studies have suggested that inhibition of DNA repair may also
be the key mechanism for treatment sensitization by some
HDAC inhibitors.21 Abexinostat has been observed to

Abexinostat is currently undergoing testing for
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in several phase
1 and 2 trials. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
evaluate the clinical parameters of abexinostat when
administered to patients in combination with doxorubicin. We observed that the MTDs of abexinostat and doxorubicin were significantly higher when patients were
supported by G-CSF. It is noteworthy that maximal histone acetylation was observed at the 30 mg/m2 dose levels,
and the administration of doxorubicin did not appear to
alter this pharmacokinetic profile. Fortunately, the
MTDs of abexinostat and doxorubicin exceeded the doses
for maximal histone acetylation, so the effectiveness of
this combination would not be limited by inadequate dosTABLE 5. Response, N 5 21

ing. We observed clinical benefit of abexinostat and doxorubicin (7 of 17 evaluable participants maintained SD
for at least 5 cycles of chemotherapy) in this cohort of 21
patients with sarcoma, including 10 patients who had previously developed disease progression on treatment with
doxorubicin. However, in this nonrandomized and
uncontrolled study, the sample size was too small to determine whether these participants would have enjoyed the
same rate of clinical benefit with doxorubicin alone. Fortunately, we did not observe any significant QTc abnormalities or any other life-threatening complications that
could be attributed to abexinostat or that otherwise were
unexplained or unexpected from patients receiving doxorubicin alone.
In conclusion, the MTD for abexinostat is 45 mg/m2
twice daily when administered on days 1 through 5 given
with doxorubicin at 75 mg/m2 on day 4 of a 3-week cycle,
and G-CSF support is required at this dose and schedule.
This phase 1 study serves as a clinical basis to perform
more extensive phase 2 or 3 studies to better define the
contributions of abexinostat to the clinical benefit for
patients with sarcoma who are receiving doxorubicin.
