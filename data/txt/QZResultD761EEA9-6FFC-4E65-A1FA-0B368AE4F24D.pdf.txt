Abstract
Apoptosis induction by BH3 mimetics is a therapeutic strategy for human cancer. These mimetics exert
single-agent activity in cells “primed” for cell death. Primed cells are dependent upon antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins for survival and are characterized by the ability of the BH3 mimetic to induce cytochrome c release from
their isolated mitochondria. Our aim was to examine the single-agent activity of obatoclax, a BH3 mimetic in
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. In clonogenic assays, inhibition of colony formation was observed by obatoclax
treatment. Despite single-agent activity by obatoclax, the mitochondria from these cells did not release cytochrome c after incubation with this BH3 mimetic. However, immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies identified Bax activation and translocation to mitochondria after treatment with obatoclax. shRNA
targeted knockdown of Bax doubled the IC50 for obatoclax but did not abrogate its cytotoxicity, whereas
knockdown of Bak did not alter the IC50. In a cell-free system, obatoclax induced an activating conformational
change of Bax, which was attenuated by a site-directed mutagenesis of a previously identified protein activation site. Finally, the drug also elicited a significant in vivo response in a rodent model of this disease. In
conclusion, single-agent obatoclax treatment results in Bax activation, which contributes, in part, to cell death
in cholangiocarcinoma cells. These data indicate that BH3 mimetics may also function as direct activators of
Bax and induce cytotoxicity in cells not otherwise primed for cell death. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1960–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Oncogene and multiple stress pathways active in human
cancers predispose malignant cells to death by apoptosis
(1). As a result, cancers often acquire mechanisms to evade
apoptosis to develop and progress (2). Apoptosis is regulated
by Bcl-2 family proteins, a protein family consisting of three
subsets: prosurvival proteins, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, A1, and
Bcl-X L ; the proapoptotic multidomain proteins Bax and
Bak; and BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, Bid, Bad, Noxa,
Bmf, Hrk, Bik, and PUMA (3). The BH3-only proteins act as
initiators of the core cell death machinery. These proteins
may be classified as activators, which by directly triggering
Bax or Bak activation induce mitochondrial dysfunction
and cellular demise, or sensitizers, which sensitize the cell
to apoptotic cues by inhibiting the function of prosurvival
Bcl-2 proteins. Bim, Bid, and possibly PUMA are classified

as activators, whereas the other BH3-only proteins are
viewed as sensitizers (4–6).
Given the ability of the BH3-only proteins to initiate cell
death pathways, the pharmaceutical industry has developed
an array of BH3-only protein mimetics (7). However, to date,
none of these has proved to be a direct activator. The binding
profiles of these mimetics are not uniform, and resistance to
these drugs has been documented. For example, overexpression of Mcl-1 is now a recognized mechanism of resistance to
the BH3-only protein mimetic ABT-737, as this mimetic specifically binds Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but not Mcl-1 (8, 9). Obatoclax, a recently developed BH3 mimetic, has a different
binding specificity than ABT-737, as it binds to all prosurvival
members of the Bcl-2 protein family, including Mcl-1 (10).
This property of obatoclax provides a potential therapeutic
advantage for this drug.
ABT-737, which functions as a sensitizing BH3 mimetic,
exerts single-agent activity in selected malignant cell lines
despite its inability to directly activate Bax or Bak. Work
by Letai and coworkers suggests that the apparent paradox
of direct cytotoxicity by a sensitizing BH3 mimetic in the absence of additional, exogenously applied apoptotic stimuli
can be explained if certain cells are “primed” for cell death
(11). The mitochondrial antiapoptotic proteins of such cells
are near capacity in their ability to sequester the activator
BH3-only proteins Bim, PUMA, and Bid. Additional BH3-only
proteins or mimetics displace preexisting bound activators
from this sequestration, liberating them to trigger Bax or
Bak oligomerization on the mitochondrial membrane (12).

A BH3 Mimetic Activates Bax

The isolated mitochondria of such cells release cytochrome c
in the presence of a BH3 mimetic (13). In contrast, the mitochondria of nonprimed cells are not “loaded” with activator
BH3-only proteins bound to antiapoptotic proteins, and isolated mitochondria from these cells do not release cytochrome c upon exposure to a BH3 mimetic.
Direct Bax activation is a common mechanism for cell
death by proapoptotic stimuli (14). Bax exists in the cytosol
as an inactive globular protein. Recent data suggest that activator BH3-only proteins may directly activate Bax by binding to a site distinct from its BH3 groove and mutation of
lysine 21 (K21E) abolishes Bax activation (15). After activating signals, the protein undergoes a conformational change,
exposing both its NH2 terminal and COOH terminal domains (16). This conformational activation facilitates its
translocation to mitochondria, where its COOH terminal
transmembrane domain inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Further stimuli promote its homooligomerization forming channels or pores in the mitochondrial
outer membrane (14, 17). These pores result in the egress
of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic proteins from the
intermitochondrial membrane space into the cytosol, triggering cell death cascades.
Cholangiocarcinoma, a devastating neoplasm (18), is resistant to current medical therapies likely due to abundant
Mcl-1 expression (19). Because obatoclax binds Mcl-1 in
addition to other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, we examined
this BH3 mimetic as a potential therapeutic agent for cholangiocarcinoma. In these studies, obatoclax was observed to
exert single-agent activity in human cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines, as well as in a syngeneic rat orthotopic model of cholangiocarcinoma. Despite the single-agent activity, the mitochondria of these cells were not “primed” for cell death.
Instead, obatoclax treatment was associated with Bax activation, suggesting that obatoclax may function as a direct
activator of this proapoptotic protein.

Materials and Methods
Obatoclax. Obatoclax was supplied by GeminX Biotechnologies, Inc. For in vitro studies, obatoclax was dissolved at 20 mmol/L in DMSO and aliquoted. Aliquots
were further diluted in sterile water immediately before each
experiment. The maximal DMSO concentration was 0.1%
(v/v), which was used as a vehicle control in respective
in vitro experiments. For in vivo experiments, obatoclax
was prepared according to the supplier's protocol.
Cell lines and culture. The human cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines HuCCT-1 (20), KMCH (21), and Mz-ChA-1 (22)
and the rat cholangiocarcinoma cell line BDEneu (23, 24)
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
100 μg/mL gentamicin, and 100 μg/L insulin.
Clonogenic and cell death assays. Clonogenic assays were
performed, as previously described (25). For colony quantification, six-well plates were stained with coomassie blue and
colonies were counted using ImageJ software (26) The IC50
was calculated as indicated using Calcusyn software (Bio-

soft). Apoptosis was confirmed by examining nuclear morphology using fluorescent microscopy after staining with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), as previously described (27).
Immunoblot analysis. Whole-cell lysates were prepared as
previously described in detail (25), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blotted with primary antibody at the
indicated dilutions. Antibodies used were Bcl-2 (N-19 Santa
Cruz, 1:1,000), Bcl-Xl (S-18 Santa Cruz 1:1,000), Bax (N-20
Santa Cruz, 1:5,000), Bak (G-23 Santa Cruz, 1:5,000), Bim
(BD Pharmigen 1:500), Bid (R&D Systems 1:1,000), Noxa
(ProSci 1:500), PUMA (Sigma 1:1,000), and actin (C-11 Santa
Cruz 1:1,000). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies for mouse (Invitrogen), rabbit (Invitrogen), and
goat (Biosource) were used at a concentration of 1:2,000.
Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Hyglo Quick Spray, Denville Scientific) and Kodak
X-OMAT film.
Mitochondria isolation. Mitochondria were isolated from
cells by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation, as
previously described (28). Briefly, cells were lifted from a
minimum of five 150-mm culture plates (∼90% confluent)
in MA buffer [100 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
20 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 g/L bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics)]
followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. Pellets were
resuspended in 3 mL of MA buffer, and nitrogen cavitation
was completed (420 lb/in2 for 10 min) on ice. The cell lysate
was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min to remove cellular
debris. The clarified supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000
× g for 15 min to pellet mitochondria. The pellet was resuspended in MA buffer, and protein concentration was quantified via the Bradford assay.
Cytochrome c release assay. Isolated mitochondria (100 μg
of protein per reaction) were resuspended in 50 μL of MA
buffer. Vehicle, drug, tBid (20 nmol/L), or lysis buffer was
added, and the reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000
× g for 15 min. The mitochondrial pellet and supernatant
were separated. Samples were subjected to immunoblot
analysis for cytochrome c (Santa Cruz, 1:1,000).
Bax immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence for the
active conformation of Bax was performed as previously
described by us (29). The Bax 6A7 antibody (Exalpha, 1:100)
was used as a primary antibody, and secondary staining was
performed with an Alexa 633–conjugated antimouse antibody
(1:1,000, Invitrogen). Images were obtained using an inverted
confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.)
equipped with a 40× lens using LSM510 imaging software (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 633 and 656 nmol/L, respectively.
Bax mitochondrial translocation, insertion, and oligomerization. For Bax translocation, mitochondria were iso‐
lated from cells as described above (five 150-mm dishes at
90% confluency per condition). The mitochondria were
resuspended in lysis buffer on ice for 15 min, and after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was

resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis for Bax (N-20
Sigma, 1:5,000) and, as a control for protein loading, cytochrome c oxidase (Sigma, 1:1,000) was completed.
For Bax mitochondrial insertion, mitochondria were isolated from cells as described above (five 150-mm dishes at
90% confluency per condition). After protein concentration
determination, 500 μg of mitochondrial protein were resuspended in 500 μL of 0.1 mol/L Na2CO3 (pH 12; Sigma) and
incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to collect mitochondrial membranes. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μL MB buffer
[210 mmol/L mannitol, 70 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5)] with 2% CHAPS, incubated on
ice for 1 h, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for
30 min. The supernatant (integral membrane proteins) was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis for Bax
(N-20 Sigma, 1:5,000). VDAC (Rockland, 1:1,000) served as a
loading control for integrated proteins.
Bax activation in a cell-free system. Recombinant human
Bax was prepared as previously described using the IMPACT
system (New England Biolabs; ref. 30). The recombinant
human Bax construct was a generous gift from Dr. Nico
Tjandra. Protein concentration was determined using

Bradford reagent (Sigma). A 20-μL reaction of recombinant
Bax protein (300 ng) in column buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES,
500 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.5)] was incubated with vehicle, increasing concentrations of obatoclax or 5% NP40 detergent
at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation, 2 μL were removed from
each reaction to assay as an input, and then 250 μL of 3%
BSA in PBS were added to each reaction with 15 μL of 6A7
anti-Bax antibody (Santa Cruz) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C.
Protein A agarose beads (60 μL) were then added to each reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight. The
beads were pelleted, washed with PBS, and boiled in SDS
sample buffer. The supernatant was subjected to immunoblot analysis for Bax (N-20 Santa Cruz, 1:2,000). Site-directed
mutagenesis of the lysine 21 residue to glutamic acid in the
Bax construct was completed using the QuikChange II kit
(Stratagene). The K21E product was confirmed by sequencing, and protein preparation and reaction were undertaken
as above. Oligomerization was assayed by incubating 5 μg
of recombinant protein in column buffer (50-μL reaction),
with vehicle or increasing concentrations of obatoclax at
37°C for 1 h. Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (Thermo Scientific) was then added at a concentration of 0.25 mmol/L for
30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched

deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were carried out using the In situ Cell
Death Detection kit (Roche) according to the supplier's protocol, as previously described by us (32). Slides were viewed
on an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200, 60×
objective), and positive cells were counted in 10 high-power
fields.
Statistical analysis. Data represent at least three independent experiments using cells from a minimum of three separate isolations and are expressed as means ± SDs. Differences
between groups were compared using two-tailed Student's

with 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature for
15 min, and the reactions were assayed by immunoblotting
with the Bax N-20 antibody.
Bax and Bak targeted knockdown by shRNA. shRNA constructs for Bax and Bak were generated and validated, as
previously described (31). HuCCT-1 cells were stably transfected with the shRNA constructs for Bax and Bak using
Fugene HD reagent (Roche). Cells were selected with puromycin (0.5 mg/L) in normal growth medium. Knockdown of
Bax and Bak expression was confirmed in clonal populations by immunoblot analysis. Cells were then used in clonogenic assays, as previously described.
In vivo studies. All animal experimentation described in
this study was performed in accordance with and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In vivo
cell transplantation was carried out in adult Fischer 344 male
rats (Harlan) with initial mean body weights ranging between
200 and 250 g, as previously described in detail by us (32). For
survival and tumor size studies, a subcutaneous port (Instech
Laboratories) was implanted on the low back of the rodent
and the attached catheter tunneled into the peritoneal cavity.
The gastroduodenal artery was cannulated in a retrograde
fashion, and the catheter doubly secured in the artery with
5 to 0 silk sutures. The catheter was flushed and locked with
heparinized saline (500 units/mL). The incisions were closed
with running 5 to 0 chromic suture. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg
SubQ) was used for postoperative analgesia. For apoptosis
studies, obatoclax (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle was given i.v. once
daily for five consecutive days starting 14 d after tumor implantation. Twenty-four hours after receiving the fifth treatment, the rats were euthanized and the livers were removed
for analysis. For tumor size and survival analysis, obatoclax
(1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle was given via hepatic artery infusion

Single-agent activity of obatoclax in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Clonogenic assays were undertaken to examine
the single-agent activity of obatoclax in four cholangiocarcinoma cell lines: three human cell lines HuCCT-1, KMCH, and
Mz-ChA-1 and the rat cholangiocarcinoma cell line BDEneu.
The HuCCT-1, Mz-chA-1, and BDEneu cell lines were sensitive to obatoclax inhibition of colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). A >50% inhibition of
colony formation was observed at concentrations between
5 and 100 nmol/L in all three cell lines with complete inhibition observed at 200 nmol/L obatoclax. The cholangiocarcinoma cell line KMCH was not sensitive to obatoclax as a
single agent at these doses, consistent with our previously
published observations (25). The sensitivity of the human
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines was directly proportional to
the level of Mcl-1 expression, with KMCH cells containing
the highest level of Mcl-1 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Obatoclax concentrations of 400 nmol/L and greater
did inhibit colony formation of KMCH cells, suggesting that
the cytoprotective effect of Mcl-1 can be overcome with higher drug concentrations (data not shown). Because either cell
cycle arrest or apoptosis can inhibit colony formation in
clonogenic assays, apoptosis by obatoclax was confirmed in
BDEneu cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). In this context, we
have shown that obatoclax displays single-agent activity
against several cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.
Cholangiocarcioma mitochondria are not primed for
death. To exclude altered expression of proapoptotic or
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins as a mechanism for cell death
by obatoclax, immunoblot analysis for these proteins was
performed. No consistent changes in expression of the
Bcl-2 family proteins were observed with obatoclax treatment in any of the three obatoclax-sensitive cell lines
(Fig. 1B). Given that expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins
was unaltered in obatoclax-treated cells, we sought to further examine the mechanism for single-agent cytotoxicity
by this BH3 mimetic. As single-agent activity by obatoclax
suggests that cholangiocarcinoma cells are primed for cell
death, we next examined the ability of this BH3 mimetic to

directly induce cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria. Unexpectedly, addition of obatoclax to mitochondria
isolated from all three sensitive cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines failed to directly induce cytochrome c release, although cytochrome c was readily identified in the supernatant when the mitochondria were incubated with tBid
protein or lysed by detergent (Fig. 2). These data suggest
that the mitochondria from these cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines are not primed for death, but rather obatoclaxinduced mitochondrial dysfunction occurs through a more
complex cascade involving cytosolic components.
Obatoclax treatment leads to Bax activation and translocation to mitochondria. Bax is a cytosolic protein, which
potently triggers cell death upon its activation. Because BH3
proteins and therefore potentially a BH3 mimetic may directly activate Bax (33, 34), we examined the activation and
subcellular localization of Bax after treatment with obatoclax. Bax activation by obatoclax was by immunofluorescence for an active conformation of Bax, using the 6A7
antibody, in all three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines
(Fig. 3A). A 3-fold increase in mitochondria-associated Bax
was also observed in isolated mitochondria after obatoclax
treatment (Fig. 3B). The translocation of Bax to mitochondria was associated with its insertion into the mitochondrial
membrane, as the association was resistant to bicarbonate
treatment (Fig. 3C). Collectively these data suggest that obatoclax either directly or indirectly promotes Bax activation.
Direct activation of Bax by obatoclax. To ascertain
whether the activation of Bax by obatoclax may be via
direct mechanism, recombinant Bax was incubated with
obatoclax in a cell-free reaction. After incubation with obatoclax, the active conformation of Bax could be immunoprecipitated with the Bax 6A7 antibody (Fig. 4A). The
amount of active Bax recovered with obatoclax treatment
increased in a concentration-dependent manner. This conformational change in Bax was not observed in vehicletreated protein; however, treatment with the detergent
NP40, which induces activating-like conformational changes
in Bax, also lead to recovery of active Bax with the 6A7 antibody. To further show the specificity of this activation,
site-directed mutagenesis of the lysine 21 residue K21E
was performed. This residue has previously been shown
to be an important residue in a Bax activation site (15).
The activation of the K21E Bax was attenuated as shown
by a decrease in the amount of immunoprecipated active
Bax after obatoclax treatment compared with detergenttreated protein (Fig. 4A). Additionally, oligomerization of
wild-type Bax (trimers and tetramers) in the cell-free system could be shown in a concentration-dependent manner
with obatoclax treatment and cross-linking (Fig. 4B); however, the higher-order multiples were significantly decreased
or absent in the mutant protein. Unexpectedly, a protein
complex consistent with Bax dimerization was observed
with cross-linker alone. In this cell-free system, obatoclax
treatment promotes Bax activation.
Cell death by obatoclax is facilitated by Bax. To further
elucidate the contribution of Bax in obatoclax-induced apoptosis, HuCCT-1 cells stably expressing shRNA for Bax or Bak

were generated. The specificity and efficiency of the shRNA
knockdown of the respective targets in these cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). The median dose
effect (Dm) for obatoclax-induced cell death, a calculation
of the median effect (surrogate for LD50 in cell death assays),
was compared between wild-type cells and those in which

Bax or Bak had been selectively knocked down. For wild-type
HuCCT-1 cells, the Dm was 27.0 nmol/L and the Bak knockdown cells had a similar Dm of 21.8 nmol/L. In contrast, the
Dm for obatoclax doubled to 55.3 nmol/L in HuCCT-1 cells
stably expressing the shBax construct, indicating a protective
effect by reducing Bax expression (Fig. 5B). These data provide further evidence suggesting Bax contributes to obatoclax-induced cell death.
In vivo activity of obatoclax. Given the in vitro activity of
obatoclax against cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, we sought
to test the in vivo effects of this drug using a recently characterized syngeneic rat orthotopic model of cholangiocarcinoma. Tumors were removed after treatment with obatoclax
or vehicle for 5 days. TUNEL staining showed a significant
increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in tumors removed from obatoclax-treated rats compared with

controls (12.3 ± 1.9 versus 5.8 ± 3 cells per high power field,
P = 0.05) with no increase in apoptosis in normal hepatocytes
(1 ± 0.1 versus 0.9 ± 0.2 cells per high power field, P = 0.5). To
further examine the in vivo efficacy of obatoclax, the drug
was given via a hepatic artery injection to ensure adequate
tumor exposure to the drug. An initial group of rats (n = 8)
had their livers removed 5 days after completing treatment,
whereas a second group was observed for survival (n = 12).
The mean tumor weights in animals treated with obatoclax
was 10-fold lower than vehicle-treated controls (0.04 ± 0.03
versus 0.38 ± 0.10 g, P < 0.001). This relationship also held
true when the ratio of tumor weight to liver weight was calculated (Fig. 6A); a 12-fold decrease in this ratio was observed in obatoclax-treated animals compared with
controls (0.003 ± 0.002 versus 0.036 ± 0.010, P < 0.001). This
decrease in tumor size also correlated with increased survival

in obatoclax-treated rats (Fig. 6B). The median survival
increased from 23 days in control animals to 44 days in
obatoclax-treated animals (P = 0.005).

Discussion
The results of this study provide new insight into the mechanisms of obatoclax-mediated cell death. The results
indicate that obatoclax (a) exerts single-agent activity in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, (b) induces cell death by promoting Bax activation, and (c) is efficacious in an in vivo model of
cholangiocarcinoma. Each of these results is discussed in
greater detail below.
In the current study, we observed maximal single-agent
obatoclax activity between concentrations of 50 to 100 nmol/L
in two human cell lines and at 200 nmol/L in a third rat cell
line (Fig. 1A). Obatoclax has been tested in small, phase I
studies of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies
(35, 36). In these studies, multiple dosing regimens were tried
with doses ranging from 3.5 to 40 mg/m2. The reported recommended phase II dose was 28 mg/m2, which corresponds
to a mean maximal plasma concentration of 73 ng/mL when
infused over a 3-hour period (35). This peak plasma concentration is equivalent to ∼175 nmol/L. Thus, biologically active
concentrations of obatoclax observed in our in vitro studies
are achievable at doses used in humans.
Obatoclax, as a single agent, inhibited colony formation in
clonogenic assays. Although cell cycle arrest will also manifest as an inhibition of colony formation in this assay, we also
confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis as shown by morphology and dependence on Bax. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 also
exerts single-agent activity in selected malignant cell lines
(37). These cells are under BH3-only protein stress, as the mitochondria isolated from such cell lines are already “loaded”
with BH3-only proteins bound to antiapoptotic proteins. The
activator BH3-only proteins released from their sequestration by the BH3 mimetic then induce mitochondrial dysfunction with cytochrome c release (11). However, we failed to
observe this phenomenon with obatoclax in mitochondria
isolated from our cell lines. We, therefore, examined the possibility that the cells are not under BH3-only protein stress
but that obatoclax delivers a sufficient activating BH3
stimulus for the cells to undergo apoptosis. If this was
true, the stimulus should directly result in Bax or Bak
activation. Interestingly, we observed Bax activation in
obatoclax-treated cells as manifest by an activating conformational change, translocation, and insertion into mitochondria. These data suggest that obatoclax provides a
sufficient BH3 stimulus to promote Bax activation. As Mcl-1
can antagonize Bax activation (38), it is likely that the ability
of obatoclax to bind Mcl-1 also contributes to Bax activation
in these cells.
Although Bak and Bax are often thought to be functionally redundant proteins in mediating outer mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization during apoptosis (39), several
observations suggest specificity for signaling through one
or the other in a cell type–specific, context-specific, and
stimulus-specific manner (40, 41). Our studies are consis-

tent with a preferential specificity for Bax in obatoclaxmediated cell death in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. For
example, Bax knockdown by shRNA doubled the median
dose effect for obatoclax (Fig. 5B). The cell-free system
studies and activation assays also suggest that obatoclax
has the potential to promote activating conformational
changes in Bax. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
suggest that a BH3-only protein mimetic may function as a
direct activating stimulus for Bax activation. This observation distinguishes obatoclax from ABT-737, which, like the
BH3 domain peptide of Bad, only binds the prosurvival
Bcl-2 proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (37) and acts as a sensitizing,
but not activating, BH3 stimulus. Obatoclax treatment lead
to significant apoptotic stimulating activity, decreased tumor
size, and improved survival in our in vivo syngeneic, orthotopic rat model of cholangiocarcinoma (24). Not only does
this model reflect a similar molecular signature as human
cholangiocarcinoma but the syngeneic, orthotopic model
avoids the problems of immunocompromise and incompatibilities of the tumor microenvironment problematic in

Figure 5. Targeted knockdown of Bak and Bax by shRNA showed
a Bax-dependent effect on cell death. shRNA specific for Bak and Bax
were stably transfected into HuCCT-1 cells (A). shBak clones (1, 3)
and shBax clones (18, 19) were subjected to increasing concentrations of
obatoclax in clonogenic assays. Dm was calculated using Calcusyn
software and is plotted in a dose-effect plot (B), indicating an increase in
Dm for the shBax clones, with unchanged Dm in the shBak clones
compared with controls. Results from the clonogenic assay were colony
forming units as a percentage of control and included three separate
trials for each clone.

human xenograft models. Analogous to our in vitro studies,
obatoclax showed single-agent activity in vivo suggesting
that the in vitro studies are applicable to the more complex
native environment of these cancers.
Whereas our studies suggest that obatoclax can directly
activate Bax in cell-free systems and cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines, it is unlikely that this is the only mechanism for obatoclax-induced cell death. Previous studies have shown the

ability of obatoclax to induce cell death in Bak/Bax doubledeficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (25, 42). Likely, there
are as yet to be determined additional mechanisms for
obatoclax-induced cell death.
In summary, obatoclax displays single-agent activity in
human cholangiocarcinoma cells and a rodent model of cholangiocarcinoma that mimics the human disease. The mechanism of cell death seems to be at least partially dependent

upon Bax activation, and the data support a process where
obatoclax seems to directly activate this proapoptotic
protein. These data extend our knowledge by which
BH3 agonists promote cell death in cancer cells. Development of BH3 mimetics, which directly activate Bax, seems
to be feasible. Finally our observations also suggest that obatoclax warrants further evaluation for the treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma.
