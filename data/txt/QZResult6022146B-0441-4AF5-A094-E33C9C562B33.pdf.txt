ABSTRACT
Autocrine motility factor (AMF), which is also known as phosphoglucose
isomerase (PGI), enhances tumor cell growth and motility. In this study, we found
that AMF and its receptor were both highly expressed in Endometrial Carcinoma
(EC) tissues compared to normal tissues. Levels of AMF were increased in serum of
endometrial cancer patients. Downregulation of AMF by shRNA inhibited invasion,
migration and proliferation as well as growth in a three-dimensional culture. AMF
cytokine function, but not enzymatic activity of PGI, regulated tumorigenic activities
of AMF. The MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway contributed to AMF-induced effects in EC cells. In
agreement, Mek inhibitor decreased AMF-induced invasion, migration and proliferation
of EC cells. In addition, in two mouse tumor metastasis models (EC cells delivered
through left ventricle or intraperitoneally) AMF-silenced EC cells showed decreased
tumor proliferative and metastatic capacities. We suggest that AMF/PGI is a potential
therapeutic target in endometrial carcinoma.

which is also known as phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI),
was originally isolated from the conditioned medium of
melanoma cancer cells and stimulates both direct and
random cell migration [7, 8]. However, this protein also
behaves as a housekeeping cytosolic enzyme of sugar
metabolism and plays a key role in both glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis pathways, catalyzing the interconversion
of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate [9].
Before the identification of its primary sequence, it was
also known by other names: neuroleukin, which promotes
growth of embryonic spinal and sensory neurons [10],
a maturation factor mediating differentiation of human
myeloid leukemia cells [11], sperm antigen-36 [12],
and a myofibril-bound serine proteinase inhibitor [13].
Several researchers independently found that secreted
AMF, a tumor-secreted cytokine, is involved in regulation
oncogenesis and tumor progression in various human
cancers including breast [14, 15], lung [16], liver
[17, 18], melanoma [19]and osteogenic sarcoma [20].

INTRODUCTION
Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent
gynecological malignancy and a leading cause of cancer
death in women worldwide. In 2014, in the USA alone,
approximately 6% (52,630) of total new cancer cases
and 3% (8,590) of total cancer deaths were from EC. [1]
Evidence indicates that although early-stage EC is often
successfully treated with surgical intervention, treatments
for late-stage EC are difficult and the prognosis is poor
[2, 3]. In particular, EC cases with regional or distal
metastasis result in a much more dismal outcome [4].
Thus, it is critical to further elucidate the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying EC tumorigenesis and to
develop novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as
well as therapeutic strategies, for EC.
Cancer progression and metastasis are controlled
by various extracellular growth factors and cytokines
[5, 6]. One such factor, autocrine motility factor (AMF),

In clinical cancer pathology, the presence of AMF in
serum and urine is one of the prognostic biomarkers that
indicate cancer progression [21–23]. Extracellular AMF
binds to its receptor, autocrine motility factor receptor,
E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (AMFR), a 78-kDa seventransmembrane glycoprotein [24, 25], and subsequently
stimulates numerous signaling pathways, including those
governed by protein kinase C (PKC) and tyrosine kinase,
the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA, and downstream JNK
[26–28]; receptor binding also leads to the activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, thereby
regulating the proliferative and angiogenic activities of
tumor cells [29–32]. Recent studies have indicated that
AMF/PGI binds HER2, a family member of EGF receptors
(HER), leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/ ERK pathways to enhance tumor cell motility
in breast cancer [14, 15]. Currently, the specific role of
AMF/PGI in human EC remains unclear, and therefore it
is of considerable interest to identify novel mechanisms to
better understand how EC occurs and disseminates.
In this paper, we first demonstrated that AMF/PGI
is significantly correlated with EC aggressiveness from all
aspects of clinical EC patients, EC cell lines and EC mouse
models. First, we tested AMF expression in EC patients.
Then, we examined the biological consequences of AMF
downregulation in aggressive human EC cell lines. Moreover,
phospho-antibody microarrays revealed that the MAPKERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in AMF-mediated
endometrial cancer and that the re-activation of MAPKERK1/2 signaling with exogenous PGI in co-cultured EC
cells induced migration, invasion and proliferation. At
last, we verified our finding using in vivo mouse models
and found that the silencing of AMF abrogated tumor
growth and lowered the level of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling
phosphorylation. These results shed light on the mechanisms
and pathways by which EC occurs and develops, providing
evidence that AMF/PGI is a novel proto-oncoprotein of EC
and therefore a potential therapeutic target.

Furthermore, AMF mRNA levels were quantified by
qRT-PCR. AMF mRNA levels were significantly higher in
the EC tissues (52 cases) than in the normal endometrium
specimens (30 cases) (P < 0.01) (Figure 1C). We verified
the AMF level in serum according to the expression of
AMF in endometrium tissue. AMF concentration in serum
of 15 patients with untreated endometrial cancer and 15
normal women (control group) were examined and we
found that there was remarkable increase in AMF secretion
in the serum of EC patients (P < 0.01) (Figure 1D)
compared with that in control group. These data indicated
that AMF expression was much higher in EC tissue and
serum than in normal endometrium and normal serum.

Effect of AMF gene silencing on EC cells
migration and invasion
Migration and invasion are important prerequisites
for tumor progression and metastasis. To determine the role
of AMF silencing in EC progression, we stably transfected
EC cell lines Ishikawa and HEC-1B. We chose these
lines due to their highly endogenous AMF expression,
confirmed by Western blot (Data is not shown). We used
lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA targeted towards human
AMF (Ishikawa/shAMF-1, Ishikawa/shAMF-2, HEC-1B/
shAMF-1 and HEC-1B/shAMF-2) and an empty vector for
a control (Ishikawa/mock and HEC-1B/mock). To examine
the efficiency of AMF silencing, the levels of mRNA
and protein expression were detected in the transfectants
(Figure 2A and 2B); silencing of endogenous AMF by
shRNA led to its near complete depletion (Figure 2B).
We observed similar changes in protein expression using
two target shRNA sequences against AMF (shAMF-1 and
shAMF-2), suggesting that the suppression of AMF is not
due to an off-target effect of the shRNA.
After silencing of AMF expression, the next
obvious question was to find out whether shAMF cells
exhibited decreased enzymatic activity of PGI. To address
the possibility that AMF silencing inhibited intracellular
PGI activity in glycolytic metabolism, we measured
intracellular PGI activity and found that silencing of
AMF by shRNA did not affect the enzymatic activity of
PGI in both EC cell lines (Figure 2C). Next, the in vitro
transwell assay was designed to test whether transfection
of shAMF altered the locomotive potential of tumor cells.
After 16 h of incubation, reduction of AMF resulted in
a significant decrease in cell migration (Figure 2D). To
study the effect of shAMF transfection on cell invasion,
parental and transfected cells were seeded on Matrigelcoated Transwell chambers. The ability of shAMF cells
to invade through Matrigel decreased dramatically
compared with that of the control cells (Figure 2E). In
conclusion, AMF silencing significantly suppressed the
migration and invasion capabilities of Ishikawa and
HEC-1B cells via reducing extracellular AMF, but not
intracellular PGI/AMF.

RESULTS
AMF is highly expressed in EC tissues and
serum of EC patients
AMF and its receptor AMFR expressions were
evaluated in normal endometrium (32 samples) and
endometrial cancer (72 samples) tissues using immuno­
histochemistry (IHC). AMF and AMFR were both
overexpressed in EC tissues compared with the normal
endometrium. AMF was found predominantly with
cytoplasmic staining and AMFR was located mainly on
the cell surface. Normal tissues stained nearly negative
for AMF and weakly positive for AMFR; however, tumor
tissues exhibited strong staining for both AMF and AMFR.

Effect of AMF gene silencing on EC cells
proliferation, cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase
transition and spheroid-forming ability

involved in AMF/PGI mediated signaling, the effect of
exogenous PGI rescue was studied. The results revealed
that purified PGI restored MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway
activation in Ishikawa/shAMF-1, Ishikawa/shAMF-2,
HEC-1B/shAMF-1 and HEC-1B/shAMF-2 cells (Figure
4C, 4D), and pretreatment with the inhibitor of MAPK
(U0126) markedly decreased the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 (Figure 4E). These results were supported by the
antibody array results and indicated that MAPK-ERK1/2
pathway activation is involved in AMF/PGI signaling.

A cell proliferation assay was used to investigate the
effect of AMF silencing on cell proliferation. Silencing
of the AMF gene decreased the number of viable cells,
whereas control cells continued to proliferate normally.
(Figure 3A).
Next, we performed cell cycle analysis to determine
whether AMF knockdown inhibits cells growth via
alteration of the cell cycle. Reduction of AMF expression
in Ishikawa/shAMF-1, Ishikawa/shAMF-2, HEC-1B/
shAMF-1 and HEC-1B/shAMF-2 inhibited the cell cycle
by arresting the G0/G1-to-S phase transition compared
with that in the parental and mock controls (Figure 3B),
suggesting AMF functions as a cell cycle priming factor
in EC cells.
To further confirm that AMF promotes tumor
growth, we employed a three-dimensional spheroid
culture system to mimic physiological conditions of
tumor growth and compared the spheroid-forming ability
of the AMF knockdown cells with that of the control
cells. Consistently, both the size and number of spheroids
formed was reduced in Ishikawa/shAMF-1 cells and HEC1B/shAMF-1 cells compared with that in mock controls
(Figure 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that
AMF might affect EC tumor cell growth.

AMF/PGI dual function mediates cell
proliferation, migration and invasion activities
through MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling
Previous studies have shown that AMF expression
is crucial for cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
To further examine whether the effects of PGI function
is required to stimulate MAPK-ERK1/2 activity in EC
cells, shAMF- and mock-transfected Ishikawa and HEC1B cells were pre-incubated with U0126 with or without
purified PGI and then subjected to motility, invasion and
proliferation assays. Pre-incubation of U0126 abolished
the PGI-induced increase in cell migration, invasion and
proliferation, indicating that activation of MAPK-ERK1/2
was essential for PGI-induced EC cell proliferation,
migration and invasion (Figure 5A, 5B and 5C).

AMF promotes tumor metastasis and
proliferation in vivo

MAPK signaling pathway is involved in AMFmediated activation

To evaluate the potential of AMF as a carcinogenic
factor in EC, we next investigated whether AMF
silencing decreased endometrial cancer progress in tumor
metastasis and growth model. HEC-1B/mock control and
HEC-1B/shAMF-1 transfected with luciferase clones
(Supplementary Figure S1) were inoculated into nude mice
via left ventricular or intraperitoneally, The mice were
monitored for 42 days. During this period, tumor growth
was serially observed by bioluminescence imaging.
Tumor metastasis was dramatically reduced in mice
injected with HEC-1B/shAMF-1 cells compared to mice
injected with control cells (HEC-1B/mock) (Figure 6A
and 6B). To confirm this observation, pathologic anatomy
analysis of the numbers of metastasis were performed
(p < 0.001, Figures 6C). Our results indicated that stable
knockdown of AMF substantially abrogated the growth
of HEC-1B EC cells. To verify its effects, tumor tissues
were examined with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and
immunohistochemistry; AMF and phospho-ERK1/2
levels were lower in the HEC-1B/shAMF-1 tumors
than in control tissues (Figure 6D), suggesting that
AMF highly inhibited EC cell metastasis via MAPKERK1/2 pathway in vivo. As a result, survival of shAMFtreated tumor-bearing mice was prolonged significantly
(Figure 6E).

The tumorigenic activation by AMF/PGI is
mediated by its interaction with receptors on the surface
of target cells [15, 33], such as AMFR/gp78, a G-protein–
coupled receptor (GPCR) family number [14]. Receptors
stimulated with AMF/PGI leading to the activation of
signaling pathways are relevant to G protein mediated
signaling pathways including MAPK/ERK axis [19], AKT
pathway [18, 34] and mTOR pathway [35].To identify the
pathways that are involved in EC signal transduction of
AMF/PGI activation, we used an antibody microarray
to detect proteins deactivated by GPCRs under AMFsilencing conditions. A signal intensity ratio of > 1.5 (logfold change 0.4) or < 0.67 (log-fold change –0.4) indicates
a significant change in protein expression. The antibody
array showed that silencing AMF in HEC-1B cells (HEC1B/shAMF-1) markedly inhibited phosphorylation of
MAPK pathway proteins MEK1 (at Thr291/Ser221) and
ERK1/2 (at Thr202/Tyr204) compared with that of the
control cells, whereas phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2
was increased (Figure 4A). To confirm the results, Western
blot analyses were performed to assess ERK1/2, MEK1/2,
and MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation in shAMF- and mocktransfected Ishikawa and HEC-1B cells (Figure 4B). To
further identify whether the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is

phosphorylation was evaluated by western blotting; β-actin was used as a loading controls.

To further prove our results, peritoneal disseminated
tumor growth assays in nude mice were performed.
As shown in Figure 6F, tumor growth was significantly
abrogated in the HEC-1B/shAMF group. The volume of
AMF silenced tumors was significantly smaller than the
control group (Figure 6G). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed that the expression of AMF, phospho-ERK1/2
and Ki-67 was decreased in the HEC-1B/shAMF tumors,
which confirmed our previous results in vitro and revealed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that AMF restrained the growth and metastasis of EC cells
in vivo (Figure 6H).

DISCUSSION
Even though most endometrial carcinomas are
diagnosed at an early stage, there is still a 15–20% chance
of EC reoccurrence and systemic therapies in metastatic
disease are of limited efficacy [36]. Cancer metastasis is a

interactions between tumor cells and a constantly changing
host microenvironment [37]. EC resulting from the
accumulation of acquired genetic mutations has been well
characterized, although the molecular mechanisms linking
the genetic changes to the aggressive nature of this disease
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

remain poorly understood. It has been long recognized that
AMF/PGI is oncogenic in tumors of neurogenic origin,
such as neuroblastoma [38]. Furthermore, recent work has
shown that its oncogenic role in other tumors, including
its ability to regulate aggressive tumors, is quite consistent
with its role in neurogenic diseases [14, 36, 39]. In this

study, for the first time, we found that AMF/PGI played an
important role in EC aggressiveness through the MAPKERK1/2 signaling pathway. The most interesting result was
the significant increase in AMF levels in the serum of EC
patients, supporting previous reports of AMF as a serum
cancer marker.
It has been reported that AMF/PGI expression is
induced in various types of cancer compared with healthy
tissues, and increases with malignancy [20, 40]. The function
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of AMF/PGI in EC has not yet been reported.. In our study,
we demonstrated that AMF was aberrantly expressed in EC
tissue compared to normal epithelium, which was consistent
with a previous study showing that AMF is a tumor-secreted
polypeptide identified by its ability to induce the migration
of the producing cells [41]. In the case of AMFR, there
were different views about its distribution and localization
in cells. Watanabe, H. et al. believed that AMFR/gp78 was
expressed on the cell surface, which made sense because
26381

Oncotarget

of its binding function with AMF [42]. Another view
demonstrated that AMFR/gp78 was mainly distributed in
the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, functioning as an E3
ubiquitin ligase [43]. Therefore, the precise positioning of
AMFR/gp78 needs further confirmation.
PGI is an example of a ‘moonlighting’ protein that
exhibits multiple cellular functions, including acting as a
secreted cytokine or glycolytic enzyme [44]. To distinguish
AMF impacted cell migration and invasion via functions
of its cell surface cytokine function or potential impacts
on glycolysis, we measured intracellular PGI activity and
found that silencing of AMF by shRNA did not affect the
enzymatic activity of PGI in both EC cell lines. Previously,
it was reported that the cytokine function of PGI has
evolved during evolution independently of the enzymatic
activity [44]. There was also experimental evidence that
a dichotomy exists between the enzymatic and cytokine
activities [45]. The shRNA designed to target AMF was
a very efficient suppressor of expression. In our study,
we observed decreased levels of AMF secretion but no
affect on enzymatic activity, which was consistent with the
above experimental results, though the mechanism needs
further investigation. AMF knockdown suppressed EC cell
migration, invasion and proliferation, indicating that AMF
promotes EC progression in an autocrine manner.
During tumor formation and metastasis, AMF/
PGI may exert its anti-apoptotic abilities [46], cause
acceleration of cell cycle transition [47] and cell
transformation [31], and induce tumor cell migration
and invasion [48]. Efforts have been made to elucidate
the mechanisms that mediate the effects of AMF, and
they revealed that several signaling pathways and
molecules were involved, for example, small GTPase
RhoA followed by JNK [28, 47], RhoC [49], MEK1/2
phosphorylation [47], protein kinase C [46], and PI3Akt pathways [18, 32]. In an attempt to shed light on
the complex mechanisms involved in specific AMF/PGI
functions, we used shAMF- and mock-transfected HEC1B endometrial cells in an anti-phosphoprotein array to
identify a unique AMF–induced ‘molecular signature’ in
the development of cell growth and motility. The analysis
established a pathway involving MAPK-ERK1/2 signal
transduction, which promotes and induces cell migration.
This signaling pathway has been proposed in other
systems, some of which apply to cancer cell invasion,
migration and metastasis [19, 50]. However, when
shAMF transfectants were exposed to exogenous PGI
and pretreated with U0126, phospho-ERK1/2 levels were
reduced, indicating the role of MAPK-ERK1/2 activation
in AMF/PGI signaling. Another interesting finding of
this study is that exposing AMF-silenced EC cells to PGI
restored the migration, invasion, and proliferation, and
inhibition of MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway. In contrast, using
U0126 counteracted those effects of exogenous PGI on
EC cells, suggesting that both AMF and PGI functions are
mediated by the MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway in EC cells and
thus exhibit this effect on EC progress.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AMF/PGI promotes the malignancy of several
cancers and silencing AMF may present an approach to the
prevention or treatment of malignant tumors in vivo. Thus
far, only very few studies about silencing of AMF in vivo
have been described [16]. Further investigation is required
to identify effective therapy strategies using AMF shRNA
approaches, given the important role of AMF in cancer
tissue. Alternatively, small-molecule antagonists against
AMF/PGI may be useful as anti-tumor or metastasis
agents [51, 52].
In this study, multiple methods have been applied
to profile the important roles of AMF/PGI involvement in
EC. However, there are still a few limitations regarding
clinic research. For example, even though the expression
of AMF in endometrial tissue was detected, along with
AMF/PGI in the serum of EC patients, the correlation
between the clinicopathologic characteristics of EC
patients and the expression of AMF in EC endometrial
tissue and serum should be identified. Further more, the
relationship between AMF/PGI expression and clinical
EC pathology should be investigated to determine whether
AMF/PGI has the potential as a biomarker to predict EC
disease prognosis.
Our results show that AMF was highly expressed
in human EC cell lines and endometrial tissue in EC
patients. AMF knockdown reduced the growth, invasion,
and migration of the EC cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Exogenous PGI stimulation induces the promotion of
EC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, likely
through MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which
suggests that AMF/PGI plays important roles in EC
occurrence and progression. AMF/PGI might be a
potential therapeutic target in EC and in vitro and
in vivo studies with AMF/PGI antagonists should be
implemented in the near future.

plates in the presence of polybrene (6 mg/mL) and then
treated with puromycin (2 mg/mL) to generate stable
clones. Puromycin-resistant AMF knockdown clones were
harvested by ring selection, and AMF gene expression
and protein level were confirmed by qRT-PCR and
immuneblotting.

Immunohistochemistry and ELISA
Paraffin-embedded EC and normal endometrium
tissue sections (4 μm) were processed for immuno­
histochemistry. Briefly, after deparaffinization and
dehydration, specimens were incubated with a specific
polyclonal antibody raised against purified rabbit AMF
(ab86950), at 1:200 dilution. Antibody binding was
detected using Envision reagents (Boster bioengineering,
Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For evaluation of AMF expression, staining
intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium),
or 3(strong). The extent of staining was scored as 0 (0%),
1 (1%–25%), 2 (26%–50%), 3 (51%–75%), or 4 (76%–
100%), according to the percentage of the positively
stained areas in relation to the whole tumor area. The sum
of the intensity score and the extent score was used as the
final staining score (0–7). Tumors with a final staining
score of 4 or higher were considered “positive” [53]. The
results were assessed by two pathologists who were blind
with respect to the tissue source. To measure serum AMF
level, serum were collected from 15 normal women and
15 EC patients and subjected to ELISA using a commercial
human AMF kit (Abcam, ab171575).

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR (quantificational
real-time polymerase chain reaction)
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies; Shanghai, PR China)
and reverse transcribed using a reverse transcriptase
kit (Takara, Dalian, PR China). Gene expression
was detected with SYBR green master mix (Takara,
Dalian, PR China) on an ABI Prism 700 thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene
expression was calculated using the 2(−ΔΔCt) formula
and normalized against β-actin. The oligonucleotide
primers were 5′-CGCCCAACCAACTCTATTG-3′
(forward) and 5′-GATGATGCCCTGAACGAAG-3′
(reverse) for human AMF detection; 5′-CAGCC
ATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGG
TCCAGACGCAGGATGGCATG-3′
(reverse)
for
human β-actin detection (as a housekeeping gene). All
experiments were performed independently in triplicate.

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
For whole-cell lysates, cells were washed twice
with PBS and collected by scraping. Cell pellets were
lysed in cold precipitation assay buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 1% NP40, Triton
X-100, sodium deoxycholate] containing 1 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg /mL
leupeptin, and 10 μg/mL aprotinin. Samples were
separated by centrifugation (15,000 rpm in 4°C for
30 min). Lysate supernatants were 100-fold concentrated
with Amicon Ultra (30,000 nominal molecular weight
limit; Millipore).
The extracted protein concentration was measure
with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Equal amounts of the proteins (20 μg of cellular
protein or 80 μg of secreted protein) were separated on
10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.2-Am PVDF
membrane (Osmonics, Inc.). Each Membranes was
then incubated overnight at 4°C with an appropriate
diluted primary antibodies. HRP-secondary anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse antibodies (diluted 1:5000 to yield
0.2 mg/mL; Abcam) were used to detect the bound
primary antibodies. Blots were visualized using the
Bioscience Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LICOR Biosciences), and band density was quantitated
using the Image-J imaging analysis software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Data were normalized to β-actin
expression by densitometry, and statistical data from
at least three experiments was graphed.

Cell culture
Ishikawa and HEC-1B cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)
and maintained according to the provider’s instruction in
DMEM/F12 media (Gibco, Auckland, NZ) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). All cells were
grown until confluent and were incubated in serumfree medium for 24 h before treatment with various
experimental agents.

Stable silencing of AMF expression by short
hairpin RNA (shRNA)
AMF shRNA constructs were cloned into pLKO.1
plasmid under the control of U6 promoter for stable
expression (Sigma) [54]. Three pairs of annealed
DNA oligonucleotides were inserted into the AgeI and
EcoRI restriction sites of pLKO.1. The most effective
pairs of sequence targeted to human AMF is: sense 5′CGCCATGTATGAGCACAAGAT-3′ and anti-sense 5′GCGGTACATACTCGTGTTCTA-3′ (shAMF-1), as
well as sense 5′-CCTGTCTACTAACACAACCAA-3′
and anti-sense 5′-GGACAGATGATTGTGTTGGT T-3′
(shAMF-2), respectively. Ishikawa and HEC-1B cells
were transfected with lentiviral vector pLKO.1 (mock)
or AMF-specific shRNA lentiviral particles in six-well

PGI enzymatic activity

Three-dimensional spheroid culture

The enzymatic activities of PGI proteins were
measured as described previously [55]. Briefly, 48 h
after transfection with vector and shAMF/PGI, cells
were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer,
and each sample at 30 μg/protein was used to measure
their enzymatic activities at A340 nm using a Shimadzu
spectrophotometer.

Three-Dimensional spheroid culture and analysis
was done as described previously with slight modification
[56]. The AlgiMatrix 3D Culture System (Invitrogen) was
used to construct an artificial bioscaffold to facilitate the
three-dimensions spheroid formation in AMF knockdown
cells (Ishikawa/shAMF-1 and HEC-1B/shAMF-1) and
controls (Ishikawa/mock and HEC-1B/mock), respectively.
Cells were seeded into AlgiMatrix six-well plates
and grown to form spheroids for 2 weeks and then
photographed under a microscope. CellProfiler 2.0
software (http://www.cellprofiler.org/) was used for image
processing to detect and quantify individual spheroids.

AMF secretion in conditioned media
Confluent cells were cultured for 3 days in
completed medium, 10% FBS, and then were starved with
serum-free medium for 24 h. The supernatant was filtered
through a 30-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore), and AMF
secretions were measured by Western blot analysis.

Luciferase assay
HEC-1B cells stably transfected with vehicle or
shAMF-1 were plated at 1 × 105 cells in six-well plates
and grown for 24 hour, and then co-transfected with
200 ng luciferase reporters using Lipofectamine 2000.
At two days post-transfection, luciferase and Renilla
activity of lysates was measured with Dual-Glo Luciferase
Reagents (Promega, E1531). Luciferase activities were
normalized against Renilla activity, and relative ratios
for each transfection were calculated. Experiments were
performed on at least three independent occasions, and
error bars indicate SD.

Transwell assay
A total of 1 × 105 cells in serum-free medium were
introduced into the upper compartment of Transwell cell
culture chambers (8 μm pore size; Corning Costar No.
3422) with or without Matrigel-coating (BD Biosciences).
The bottom chamber was filled with PGI (10 μg/mL),
U0126 (20 μmol/L) or DMSO. After 16 h (migration
assay) or 24 h incubation (invasion assay which with
Matrigel-coating), cells were stained with Calcein-AM
(0.2 μg/mL; Invitrogen, NO.C3100MP) for 30 min. The
number of cells that had migrated or invaded was counted
using MetaMorph image analysis software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the result was calculated as
mean average ± SD (n = 3).

Phospho-protein profiling using an antiphosphoprotein array
The anti-phosphoprotein microarray PGP193, which
was designed and manufactured by Full Moon Biosystems,
Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), contains 193 antibodies. Each of
the antibodies has six replicates that are printed on coated
glass microscope slides, along with multiple positive and
negative controls. In brief, cell lysates obtained from HEC1B/mock and HEC-1B/shAMF-1 were biotinylated with
the Antibody Array Assay Kit (Full Moon Biosystems,
Inc.). The antibody microarray slides were first blocked
in a blocking solution (Full Moon Biosystems, Inc.) and
dried with compressed nitrogen. The slides were then
incubated with the biotin-labeled cell lysates (~100 μg
protein) in coupling solution at room temperature for
2 h and rinsed extensively with Milli-Q grade water
before detection of bound biotinylated proteins using
Cy3-conjugated streptavidin. The slides were scanned on
a GenePix 4000 scanner and the images were analyzed
with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). The fluorescence signal for each antibody was
obtained from the fluorescence intensity of this antibody
spot. A ratio computation was used to assess the extent
of protein phosphorylation. For each antibody that has
phosphorylated and matching unphophorylated values in
both the control data and experiment data are represented
as “phospho” and “unphospho”.

Cell proliferation assay
For cell proliferation assay, 2 × 103 cells/well were
plated in triplicate for each group on 96-well plates, and
the media including exogenous PGI, U0126, or DMSO
were added the day after plating. Cells were grown for
5 days and fresh medium was provided every day. The
number of cells was determined using the MTS kit
(Promega, NO.G3580). The metabolically active cells
reduced MTS to a soluble formazan product, and the
absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a plate reader
(Bio-Rad). Wells containing known cell numbers (0, 1000,
2000, 5000, 10000, 20000 or 40000 cells/well; 6 wells/cell
density) were treated in the similar fashion to establish
standard curves. Three independent experiments were run
for the cell proliferation assay.

Flow cytometry analysis
Whole-cell suspensions were stained with 50 ug/mL
PI (propidium iodide) after 70% ethanol fixation and
analyzed for cell cycle phase distribution with a BD
Biosciences flow cytometer.

In vivo experiments and analyses

(No. 13JC1404501) and the Doctoral Fund of Ministry of
Education of China (No. 20120073110090).

The left ventricle of the heart or intraperitoneal
injection tumor metastasis model was used to evaluate
the effect of silencing AMF on tumor progressive [57,
58]. Twenty 5–6 week-old female athymic nude mice
(BALB/c) were obtained from Sino-British Sippr/BK
Lab Animal Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China). The mice were
randomly divided into two groups (n = 10 mice in each
group). All mouse studies were performed in accordance
with animal protocol procedures approved by the
Department of Laboratory Animal Science at the School
of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Excess
anesthetic was used to euthanize mice at the end of the
experiment.
For this protocol, AMF stable knockdown cells
(HEC-1B/shAMF-1) and the control cells (HEC-1B/mock)
stably expressing firefly luciferase were resuspended in
sterile PBS (50 μl) and injected (5 × 104 cells/injection)
into the left ventricle of the heart or intraperitoneal
of 8-week-old female BALB/c mice. Metastasis was
determined at 3, 14, 21 and 28 days post-injection by
bioluminescent imaging on a Xenogen IVIS-200 (Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). At day 42, the mouse
were injected with control cells (HEC-1B/mock) were
all nature dead meanwhile the mice left were killed, and
then any disseminated tumors of >1 mm in diameter
were resected and counted for each mouse. The volume
of the tumor metastasis was measured by the sum of all
disseminated tumors, and the tumor volume was calculated
as (Rmax) × (R2 - min)/2. HEC-1B/mock and HEC-1B/
shAMF-1 tumor metastases were counted, and serial
histologic sections of tumor metastasis were processed for
H&E staining and histological examination. Procedures
for IHC analysis of AMF, p-ERK1/2 and Ki-67 were done
as described above.
