ABSTRACT:
The advent of a mechanism specific inhibitor imatinib, targeting Bcr-Abl kinase, has
paved the way for new treatment strategies in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).
However, resistance to imatinib is common in patients and has recently been linked to
both transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and elevated Lyn kinase activity, although
molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, using leukaemic MYL cell lines
derived from CML patients, we show that TGFβ plays a key role in imatinib-resistance
via direct effects on Lyn ubiquitination and turnover that results in bursts of Lyn kinase
activity, and identify c-cbl is a candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, blockade of
TGFβ signalling activity with the TGFβ receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542 significantly
reduces Lyn turnover and activation, and subsequently enhances imatinib-mediated
CML cell death in a proteasomal-dependent manner. Collectively, our data reveals novel
co-operative mechanisms in CML involving TGFβ and Lyn kinase linked to proteasome
function and ubiquitination, and thus supports therapeutic approaches that target
TGFβ pathway activity as a strategy for overcoming imatinib-resistance in CML.

INTRODUCTION

of imatinib-resistance in CML [9-12], and activated Lyn
results in elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, which protects CML cells from imatinib-mediated cell
lethality [13]. Furthermore, in CML cells, knockdown of
elevated Lyn expression by siRNA resulted in increased
apoptosis and enhanced imatinib sensitivity [14].
At present, the precise molecular mechanisms
responsible for increased Lyn expression and activation
in CML have not been established, although it is likely
to involve induction and/or re-wiring of other signalling
pathways linked to haematopoietic cell function. A prime
candidate in this regard is transforming growth factor-β
(TGFβ), which is known to play a vital role in maintaining
the growth and differentiation balance in haematopoietic
cells [15]. In general, TGFβ is a robust inhibitor of
committed progenitor cell function, and autocrine
production of TGFβ maintains haematopoietic stem cell
quiescence [16]. Several recent studies have attempted to
unravel the effects TGFβ on leukaemia cell proliferation.
A TGFβ/FOXO/Akt signalling axis was found to be
responsible for imatinib resistance in a CML stem cell

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a disease of
haematopoietic stem cells and originates from a specific
chromosomal transfer event that generates a hybrid BcrAbl oncoprotein with tyrosine-kinase activity and cell
transforming capacity [1]. Recently, a Bcr-Abl kinase
inhibitor (Imatinib, Gleevac or STI571) has been used
to treat CML with some success [2]. However, patients
become resistant mainly due to a small group of immature
Bcr-Abl +ve stem cells in the bone marrow that have
stopped dividing, and become refractory to the effects
of an inhibitor which is only effective against growing
cells [3]. Mechanisms associated with imatinib-resistance
include Bcr-Abl point mutations and increased Bcr-Abl
protein expression [4, 5]. In addition, Bcr-Abl-independent
mechanisms of resistance have been proposed [6],
including elevated P-glycoprotein drug efflux [7], and the
recruitment of other signalling cascades [8]. Most notably,
several recent studies highlight an emerging role for Lyn
kinase overexpression and activation in the development

population and it was shown that pre-treatment of CML
stem cells with the TGFβ receptor inhibitor LY364947
efficiently activated Akt and suppressed FOXO-induced
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [17]. Furthermore, this
study demonstrated that combined treatment with
LY364947 and Imatinib significantly reduced lethality in
a CML mouse model and decreased stem cell frequency.
In support of these data, TGFβ has also been reported as
a candidate niche factor to maintain haematopoietic stem
dormancy and hibernation [18]. Collectively, these data
suggest that blockade of TGFβ signalling activity could
potentially promote efficient eradication of residual CML
stem cells, a notion that is also supported the finding that
Bcr-Abl enhances TGFβ signalling activity in CML cells
[19].
Interestingly, previous studies have implicated a
role for TGFβ in regulating Lyn function, and TGFβ
stimulation over a 30 minutes timeframe caused a rapid
decrease in cellular levels in Lyn together with a decrease
in Lyn kinase activity in a prostate cancer cell line [20].
Here, we investigated inter-connections between TGFβ
and Lyn in the MYL cell line derived from a CML patient
and find that TGFβ stimulation drives rapid ubiquitination
and proteasomal turnover of Lyn. Interestingly, prolonged
stimulation results in Lyn protein replenishment and a
significantly elevated re-bound in the level of Lyn kinase
activity. Furthermore, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase
c-cbl as a candidate intermediate that drives TGFβmediated Lyn turnover/activation, and show that blocking
TGFβ signalling activity reduces Lyn activity and
concomitantly sensitizes CML cells to imatinib-mediated
cell death. Therefore, based on this new mechanistic
insight we propose that blockade of TGFβ signalling
activity in combination with the Bcr-Abl inhibitor Imatinib
could provide a basis for the treatment of drug-resistant
CML.

we observed an increase in higher molecular weight Lyn
reactive bands that was not seen in the presence of the
type I TGFβ receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542 (Figure
1A). Quantification also indicates that this rapid decrease
and then recovery in Lyn protein levels was significantly
attenuated in cells incubated with MG132 (Figure 1B).
Since the high molecular weight Lyn reactive species
were seen primarily in the presence of MG132, we next
tested whether they might represent ubiquitinated Lyn
species. There is a clear induction of high molecular
weight polyubiquitinated Lyn protein that peaks at 1hour
of stimulation, and this is not seen in cells that were pretreated with 10µM SB431542 (Figure 1C). Next, we
examined whether prolonged stimulation of MYL cells
with TGFβ affects Lyn protein kinase activity using
a specific immune kinase assay and poly(Glu-Tyr) as
substrate. Following 30minutes TGFβ stimulation, Lyn
kinase activity declines rapidly but then recovers again to
peak after 3hours (Figure 1D). This influence of TGFβ on
Lyn kinase activity was confirmed by treatment of cells in
the presence of 10µM SB431542 in which there is a slow
but steady drop in Lyn activity (Figure 1D).
This induction of Lyn ubiquitination seen
endogenously in MYL cells was then confirmed using
ectopic overexpression experiments (Figure 2A). There
are a number of potential E3 Ubiquitin ligases that might
connect cell surface TGFβ receptor activation to Lyn
ubiquitination. Previous studies highlighted dysregulated
TGFβ signalling in cbl-/- cells [21], as well as oncogenic
cbl mutations in several myeloid malignancies [22], and
c-cbl is known to interact with Lyn and drive it Lyn polyubiquitination [23]. Interestingly, we find that TGFβ can
stimulate cbl-mediated Lyn ubiquitination in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2B), as well as induce c-cbl
mRNA expression (Figure 2C). Therefore, we suggest that
mechanistically TGFβ drives bursts of Lyn ubiquitination
and turnover via inducing c-cbl transcription and
expression.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Inhibition of type TGFβ receptor kinase enhances
Imatinib mediated CML cell death

TGFβ-induced Lyn ubiquitination generates
bursts of Lyn kinase activity in CML cells

Since TGFβ is able to drive bursts of Lyn kinase
activity, and elevated Lyn kinase has been implicated
in imatinib-resistance, we next investigated whether
blockade of TGFβ signaling might influence CML cell
growth and sensitivity to Imatinib. Cell Cycle analysis
indicates that addition of TGFβ increases the proportion
of MYL cells in G0/G1 phase by 5%, concomitant with a
5% reduction in the S phase population (Figure 3A). In the
presence of SB431542 alone there is a decrease in the G0/
G1 cell population and a 2% increase in cells in S phase
indicative also of relatively high autocrine TGFβ activity,
and an increase of almost 6% in the G2/M population
compared to TGFβ treated cells (Figure 3A). Therefore,

Since previous studies have implicated a role for
both TGFβ activity and Lyn kinase overexpression in
CML, we examined whether TGF might exert a direct
influence on Lyn function in MYL cells derived from a
chronic phase CML patient [10]. Initially, we treated MYL
cells with TGFβ and probed cellular lysates by western
blotting with a Lyn antibody to monitor changes in Lyn
protein levels. Unexpectedly, we found a significant
decrease in the levels of Lyn after 30 minutes followed by
a significant increase in Lyn following prolonged 6hours
stimulation (Figure 1A). Interestingly, in the presence of
the general ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitor MG132

it is apparent that inhibition of TGFβ signalling in MYL
cells encourages progression through the cell cycle, an
important observation in the context of dual treatment
approaches since imatinib is only effective against
dividing cells. We then used MTS assays to assess whether
combined treatment with Imatinib and SB431542 could
influence MYL cell survival. In the presence of Imatinib,
MYL cell survival gradually falls with increasing doses
up to 0.1µM, and combined with SB431542 which in this
instance blocks autocrine TGFβ signaling activity there is
a significant decrease in cell survival (Figure 3B). We then
examined whether SB431542 enhanced Imatinib-mediated
cell death using Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage assays to assess cells undergoing apoptosis.
There is a significant reduction in un-cleaved PARP
(113kDa) in MYL cells exposed for 12 hours to both
SB431542 and Imatinib combined with a clear increase

in cleaved PARP at 29kDa (Figure 3C). Finally, we used
an alternative assay for apoptosis based on changes in
Annexin-V staining as monitored using flow cytometry.
Here, cells were pre-treated in the presence/absence
TGFβ for 1hour to drive Lyn turnover, and combination
treatment of imatinib with SB431542 significantly
enhances apoptosis compared to either imatinib or SB
treatment alone (Figure 3D). Furthermore, we find that
pre-treatment with MG132 attenuates the combined
effect of imatinib and SB431542 implicating the ubiquitin
proteasome system in this dual additive response, although
this may be an indirect effect not necessarily related to
TGFβ-induced Lyn ubiquitination.
In summary, we have shown for the first time
direct inter-connections between TGFβ and Lyn kinase
in a cell line derived from a CML patient. We find that
prolonged TGFβ stimulation drives ubiquitination and

rapid turnover of Lyn resulting in Lyn replenishment
and bursts of Lyn kinase activity. Furthermore, we show
that inhibiting endogenous TGFβ signalling reduces
Lyn activity and concomitantly encourages exit from
cell cycle arrest and sensitizes CML cells to imatinibmediated cell death. Therefore, our findings highlight new
mechanistic insight linked to CML disease resistance, and
suggest that the use of TGFβ inhibitors in combination
with Imatinib to overcome drug-resistant CML clearly
warrants further consideration. Our future work will be
focussed on extending our findings to a range of primary
cells from imatinib-sensitive and resistant patients to
confirm clinical significance, and understanding further
in vivo mechanisms linked to CML pathology as well as
characterising specific E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for
TGFβ-induced Lyn ubiquitination.
