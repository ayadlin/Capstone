ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance is one of the most significant obstacles in lung adenocarcinoma
(LAD) treatment, and this process involves genetic and epigenetic dysregulation
of chemoresistance-related genes. Previously, we have shown that restoration of
microRNA (miR)-200b significantly reverses chemoresistance of human LAD cells by
targeting E2F3. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the silencing of miR200b are still unclear. Here we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
could restore the expression of miR-200b and reverse chemoresistant phenotypes
of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. HDAC1/4 repression significantly increased miR200b expression by upregulating histone-H3 acetylation level at the two miR-200b
promoters partially via a Sp1-dependent pathway. Furthermore, silencing of HDAC1/4
suppressed cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest
and ultimately reversed in vitro and in vivo chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells, at least partially in a miR-200b-dependent manner. HDAC1/4 suppressioninduced rescue of miR-200b contributed to downregulation of E2F3, survivin and
Aurora-A, and upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3. HDAC1/4 levels in docetaxelinsensitive human LAD tissues, inversely correlated with miR-200b, were upregulated
compared with docetaxel-sensitive tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest that
the HDAC1/4/Sp1/miR-200b/E2F3 pathway is responsible for chemoresistance of
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

INTRODUCTION

of patients. Therefore, identification of the underlying
molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance in LAD has
become a key issue in clinical treatment of human LAD.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding
RNAs that silence their target mRNAs by binding
to the 3′-untranslated region of target genes and
function as important post-transcriptional regulators
of chemoresistance-associated genes [3-7]. Recently,
miRNAs have been reported to be associated with
chemoresistance of cancer, mainly through abnormal
regulation of cell viability [8], cell apoptosis [9], cell cycle
distribution [10], epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
[11] and cancer stem cell self-renewal [12, 13]. The miR-

Lung cancer, a predominant public health problem
worldwide, is responsible for more cancer-related deaths
than any other cancer in both women and men [1]. Lung
cancer was expected to account for 28% of all male cancer
deaths and 26% of all female cancer deaths in 2013 [2].
Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is the most common
histological form of lung cancer and chemotherapy is a
significant component of the current first-line therapies
for LAD. However, chemoresistance has become a major
obstacle in chemotherapeutic treatment of LAD, especially
at advanced stage, and is associated with poor prognosis

200 family members, consisting of miR-200b, miR-200c,
miR-429, miR-200a and miR-141, are considered tumor
suppressor miRNAs that can differentially regulate cell
viability, invasion, apoptosis, cell cycle progression and
EMT during tumor development and progression [1416]. MiR-200b, a potent tumor suppressor located in the
miR-200b/c/429 gene cluster, has already been linked
to chemoresistance of tumor cells by modulating cell
viability, cell apoptosis, EMT and cancer stem cell selfrenewal [13, 17].
Previously, we have showed that miR-200b is
significantly downregulated in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells, and restoration of miR-200b can enhance their in
vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity by post-transcriptionally
downregulating E2F3 [18]. Nevertheless, the underlying
molecular mechanisms responsible for downregulation
of miR-200b in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells have not
been fully illustrated. Epigenetic gene repression has
been regarded as a hallmark of tumor cells and plays
pivotal roles in silencing of tumor suppressors. DNA
methylation and histone modification are the two major
forms of epigenetic changes at the promoter regions of
genes. Several studies have demonstrated that DNA
methylation is one of the potential molecular mechanisms
controlling miR-200b expression in tumor cells [19,
20]. DNA hypermethylation-mediated silencing of miR200b has been reported to be associated with cancer
progression in primary lung tumors and advanced breast
cancer [19, 20]. However, administration of a universal
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine,
5-aza-dC) has no obvious effects on miR-200b expression
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, suggesting that DNA
methylation might not be the specific mechanism
underlying downregulation of miR-200b in docetaxelresistant LAD cells.
Histone acetylation, modulated by histone
deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) [21], represents one of the most important
epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression
and regulates various pathological processes by the
transcriptional regulation of genes [22]. HDACs are a
class of chromatin-modulating enzymes that remove
acetyl groups from lysine residues around gene promoters
and play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of gene
expression [23-25]. Recently, several studies indicated
that inhibition of HDACs contributes to the upregulation
of miRNAs involved in several cancers [23, 26, 27].
HDAC repression-induced overexpression of miR-15a,
miR-16 and miR-29b is associated with induction of cell
death in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
[23]. HDAC1–3 inhibition-mediated miR-449 expression
promotes cell apoptosis and reduces cell proliferation
in hepatocellular carcinoma [27]. The HDAC4/Sp1/
miR-200a regulatory network responsible for the
downregulation of miR-200a enhances the proliferation
and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [28].

Together this suggests that histone acetylation might be
an important molecular mechanism involved in regulation
of miR-200b in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the
possible molecular mechanisms by which HDACs
negatively regulate miRNA-200b expression and elucidate
the relationship between histone acetylation-modulated
miR-200b expression and chemoresistance of LAD
cells. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no
reports about HDAC-mediated silencing of miR-200b in
regulating chemoresistance of LAD cells, and thus the
present study could provide a novel strategy for reversing
chemoresistance of LAD.

RESULTS
Histone deacetylase inhibitors elevate miR-200b
levels and reverse chemoresistance of docetaxelresistant LAD cells
To better understand the underlying molecular
mechanisms of chemoresistance in LAD, docetaxelresistant LAD cell lines generated from parental H1299
or SPC-A1 cell lines were previously established in our
lab. The miR-200b level as measured by qRT-PCR was
significantly decreased in H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/DTX
cell lines compared with that in H1299 and SPC-A1 cell
lines, respectively (Figure 1A). To examine the potential
epigenetic mechanisms responsible for downregulation
of miR-200b in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, histone
deacetylase inhibitors (Trichostatin A, TSA, and valproic
acid, VPA) or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2’deoxycytidine, 5-aza-dC) were administered to H1299/
DTX and SPC-A1/DTX cells. Treatment of TSA and VPA
significantly upregulated miR-200b expression, compared
to no effects with 5-aza-dC, which indicated that histone
acetylation might be the potential epigenetic mechanism
responsible for downregulation of miR-200b levels in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells (Figure 1C, 1B). Acetylhistone H3 protein levels in H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/
DTX increased after treatment with TSA and VPA (Figure
1E). We next examined the effects of TSA and VPA on
the IC50 values of docetaxel and paclitaxel in H1299/DTX
and SPC-A1/DTX cells.It was showed that treatment of
TSA and VPA could lead to the decreased IC50 values
(docetaxel and paclitaxel) in H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/
DTX cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1D).

the downregulation of miR-200b in docetaxelresistant LAD cells

cells compared with those in parental H1299 and SPC-A1
cells, respectively (Figure 2B, 2C).
To further reveal the potential molecular
mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of
miR-200b, we analyzed the core regions of its promoters.
Multiple Sp1 binding sites in the promoter regions
could be identified, suggesting that Sp1 might be a key
transcription factor of miR-200b. Schematics of the
human miR-200b promoters are presented in Figure 3A
and the putative Sp1-binding sites and mutations are
indicated. The two promoters of the miR-200b gene were
cloned into the pGL3 basic firefly luciferase reporter and
evaluated in luciferase assays. Our data indicated that
both promoters were active in H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/
DTX cell lines (Figure 3B). To determine the effects of
HDAC1 and HDAC4 in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells,
several sh-RNA vectors of HDAC1 and HDAC4 were

To determine the specific HDACs involved in the
regulation of miR-200b expression, vectors containing
siRNAs against each of the eleven isoforms of HDACs
were transfected into H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/DTX
cells. 48 h after transfection, western blot confirmed
the inhibitory efficiency of all HDACs-siRNA vectors
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Notably, inhibition of
HDAC1 or HDAC4 significantly upregulated the levels
of miR-200b (Figure 2A). Results from qRT-PCR and
western blot assays demonstrated that the expression
levels of HDAC1 and HDAC4 mRNA and protein were
significantly elevated in H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/DTX

promoters were attenuated (Figure 3C). When H1299/
DTX or SPC-A1/DTX cells were co-transfected with
siRNA-HDAC1 or siRNA-HDAC4 and siRNA-Sp1,
the upregulation of miR-200b induced by HDAC1/4
downregulation could be partially abrogated by Sp1
(Figure 3D). To determine whether HDAC1 or HDAC4
interacts with Sp1, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation
analysis, and showed that HDAC1 and HDAC4 were
associated with Sp1 in vivo (Figure 4A). Furthermore,
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed
that both HDAC1/4 and Sp1 co-localized to the miR200b promoters at the Sp1-binding sites in vivo (p21 was
used as a positive control) (Figure 4B, 4C). ChIP assay
also revealed that inhibition of HDAC1/4 increased the
histone-H3 acetylation level of the miR-200b promoters at
Sp1-binding sites (Figure 4D). Therefore, the HDAC1/4Sp1 complexes negatively regulate miR-200b expression
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

sh-HDAC4#3 and SPC-A1/DTX/sh-HDAC4#3 cell lines
was significantly increased by 3.31-, 4.84-, 3.95- and 4.41fold, respectively (P < 0.01, Figure 5C; Supplementary
Figure 1B) compared with control cells. Likewise, the
apoptosis-promoting effect was weakened when miR200b inhibitor was previously transfected (Figure 5C;
Supplementary Figure 2B). Similar effects of HDAC1/4
on the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 protein level were
observed (Figure 5D). Cell cycle analysis showed that
downregulation of HDAC4 dramatically increased the
percentage of cells in G2/M phase in H1299/DTX and
SPC-A1/DTX cells, which could be partially reversed by
miR-200b inhibitor (P < 0.01, Figure 5E, Supplementary
Figure 2C). Therefore, suppression of HDAC1/4 could
reverse the in vitro chemoresistance of LAD cells, at least
partially in a miR-200b-dependent manner.

HDAC1/4/Sp1/miR-200b signaling is responsible
for aberrant expression of E2F3, survivin and
Aurora-A in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells

HDAC1/4 repression reverses the in vitro
chemoresistance of LAD cells partially in a miR200b-dependent manner

E2F3, a functional target of miR-200b [18], plays
crucial roles in regulating the chemoresistance of LAD
cells. Next we focused on whether the HDAC1/4/Sp1/
miR-200b pathway might be involved in the regulation
of E2F3 and its downstream target genes. qRT-PCR
and western blot assays indicated that inhibition of
HDAC4 led to the decreased mRNA and protein levels
of E2F3, Aurora-A and survivin (Figure 6A, 6B), and the
downregulating effects could be partially rescued by miR200b inhibitor (Figure 6A, 6B). Likewise, silencing of
HDAC1 also led to the decreased expression of survivin
mRNA and protein (Figure 6A, 6B). However, HDAC1
repression had no significant effect on Aurora-A in H1299/
DTX and SPC-A1/DTX cells (Figure 6A, 6B).
To further determine the roles of HDAC1/4/Sp1/
miR-200b signaling in the regulation of E2F3-related
target genes, we analyzed the genomic sequences of
promoters of Aurora-A and survivin as reported in
previous studies [29, 30], and found multiple binding sites
for the E2F3 transcription factor in Aurora-A and survivin
promoters. We cloned the fragments of the promoters
containing E2F3-binding sites into the pGL3 basic firefly
luciferase reporter, and luciferase assays showed that
the promoters of Aurora-A and survivin were active in
SPC-A1/DTX cells (Figure 7A). To confirm the effects of
HDAC1/4 on the promoters of Aurora-A and survivin, shcontrol, sh-HDAC1 or sh-HDAC4 vector was transfected
into SPC-A1/DTX cells that were cotransfected with
Renilla and either wild-type (Aurora-A or survivin), E2F3
binding mutant or empty vector firefly promoter reporter
constructs. HDAC4 suppression significantly decreased
the luciferase activity of the Aurora-A and survivin
promoters (P < 0.01, Figure 7A), and the downregulating
effect was partially attenuated by miR-200b inhibitor.

To confirm the effects of HDAC1/4 on regulating the
chemoresistance of LAD cells, sh-control, sh-HDAC1#2
or shRNA-HDAC4#3 vectors were transfected into
H1299/DTX and SPC-A1/DTX cells without (or with)
previous transfection with miR-200b inhibitor, and the
IC50 values of docetaxel or paclitaxel were measured by
MTT assay (Figure 5A). The IC50 values of docetaxel (or
paclitaxel) in SPC-A1/DTX/sh-HDAC1#2, H1299/DTX/
sh-HDAC1#2, SPC-A1/DTX/sh-HDAC4#
3 or H1299/DTX/sh-HDAC4#3 cells were
significantly decreased (P < 0.01) compared with those
in control cells. Nevertheless, the inhibition effects
could be partially abrogated by miR-200b inhibitor
(Figure 5A). However, the IC50 values of docetaxel (or
paclitaxel) in SPC-A1/DTX/pcDNA3.1-HDAC1, H1299/
DTX/pcDNA3.1-HDAC1, SPC-A1/DTX/pcDNA3.1HDAC4 or H1299/DTX/pcDNA3.1-HDAC4 cells were
significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with those in
control cells. Intriguingly, the effects of upregulation of
HDAC1 or HDAC4 on the IC50 values could be partially
abrogated by miR-200b mimics (Figure 5A). These data
clearly indicated that upregulation of HDAC1/4 could
promote chemoresistance of LAD cells.
Also, downregulation of HDAC1/4 significantly
reduced the colony formation capacities of H1299/
DTX and SPC-A1/DTX cell lines, and these effects
were also partially reversed by miR-200b inhibitor (P <
0.01, Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 2A). Next, flow
cytometric assay was performed to evaluate apoptosis
and cell cycle. When the cells were treated with 100
µg/L docetaxel, the apoptosis rate of H1299/DTX/shHDAC1#2, SPC-A1/DTX/sh-HDAC1#2, H1299/DTX/

effect of HDAC1/4 on the in vivo ability of E2F3 binding
to the promoter of Aurora-A or survivin. As shown
in Figure 7B, inhibition of HDAC4 but not HDAC1
significantly reduced the amount of E2F3 binding to the
promoter of Aurora-A, while downregulation of both of
HDAC4 and HDAC1 significantly reduced the amount
of E2F3 binding to the promoter of survivin. These data
suggest that the HDAC1/4/Sp1/miR-200b signaling plays
a critical role in the regulation of E2F3, survivin and
Aurora-A in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

A similar effect of HDAC1 inhibition on regulation of
survivin, but not Aurora-A, could be also observed in
SPC-A1/DTX cells (Figure 7A). However, the effects of
HDAC1/4 inhibition on survivin or Aurora-A promoters
were almost abolished in constructs in which the E2F3
binding sites were mutated (Figure 7A). Together these
data indicate that HDAC1/4/Sp1/miR-200b signaling
regulated the promoter activity of Aurora-A and survivin
in an E2F3-dependent manner.
Next, ChIP assay was performed to determine the

groups (Figure 8C and Supplementary Figure 3).
Immunostaining showed that the positive rates of
PCNA and Ki67 in sh-HDAC1#2, sh-HDAC4#3 and miR200b vector groups were significantly decreased compared
with those in the control group (Supplementary Figure 3).
TUNEL staining revealed increased apoptotic cells in
tumors generated from sh-HDAC1#2, sh-HDAC4#3 and
miR-200b vector groups compared with the control group

suppression of HDAC1/4 or upregulation of miR-200b
chemosensitizes docetaxel-resistant LAD cells in vivo.

To further confirm the effect of HDAC1 or HDAC4
on the in vivo chemosensitivity of LAD cells, H1299/
DTX cells stably transfected with various constructs
were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice. When
treated with docetaxel, tumors derived from H1299/

controls (Figure 8A). The expression level of miR-200b
was upregulated in sh-HDAC1#2, sh-HDAC4#3 and miR200b vector groups compared with the control groups
(Figure 8B). As shown in Figure 8C and Supplementary

were significantly downregulated in sh-HDAC1#2 and shHDAC4#3 groups. Furthermore, E2F3 and survivin levels
were downregulated in sh-HDAC1#2, sh-HDAC4#3 and
miR-200b vector groups, but Aurora-A level was only
downregulated in sh-HDAC4#3 and miR-200b vector

and ‘‘insensitive’’ (stable or progressive disease, SD+PD)
groups based on the response to the docetaxel-based
chemotherapies. The clinicopathological factors of LAD
patients are shown in Supplementary Table 5. HDAC1/4
was significantly upregulated in the docetaxel-insensitive
group (n=37) compared with the docetaxel-sensitive
group (n=31) (Fig. 9A and 9B). ROC curve analysis
was performed to establish the optimal cutoff values for
the HSCORE of HDAC1 and HDAC4 expression level,
which yielded a value of 102.3 and 78.3, respectively
(data not shown). Statistical analysis showed that high
HDAC1 or HDAC4 mRNA expression was significantly
correlated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.003 or
0.030, respectively) and poor tumor response of patients
(P=0.004 or 0.001, respectively). A statistically significant
inverse correlation was observed between HDAC1 and
miR-200b (r=-0.799, P < 0.01; Fig. 9C). A statistically
significant inverse correlation was also observed between
HDAC4 and miR-200b (r=-0.781, P < 0.01; Fig. 9D).
In addition, the correlations of HDAC1/4
expression with survival of patients were statistically
analyzed. Patients with a high HDAC1 expression
(HSCORE≥102.3) had a significantly shorter progressionfree survival (PFS) than did those with a low HDAC1
expression (HSCORE<102.3) (P=0.0185; Supplementary
Figure 4A). Likewise, patients with a high level of
HDAC4 expression (HSCORE≥78.3) had a significantly

shorter PFS than did those with a low level of HDAC4
expression (HSCORE<78.3) (P=0.0032; Supplementary
Figure 4B). Thus, upregulation of HDAC1/4, inversely
correlated with downregulation of miR-200b in LAD
tissues, was correlated with poor survival of patients who
received docetaxel-based chemotherapies.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we present several novel
findings: (1) HDAC inhibitors restore the expression of
miR-200b and reverse chemoresistance of docetaxelresistant LAD cells, (2) HDAC1/4 levels are upregulated
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells compared with parental
cells, and inhibition of HDAC1/4 significantly increases
the level of miR-200b and upregulates histone H3acetylation level at miR-200b promoters partially via
a Sp1-dependent pathway, (3) negative regulation of
HDAC1/4 suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell
apoptosis, induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and ultimately
reverses in vitro chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells partially in a miR-200b-dependent manner,
(4) HDAC1/4 suppression-induced miR-200b expression
contributes to the downregulation of E2F3, survivin and
Aurora-A, and upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3, (5)
downregulation of HDAC1/4 or upregulation of miR-200b

Figure 9: HDAC1/4, inversely correlated with miR-200b, is upregulated in docetaxel-insensitive human LAD cases
compared with docetaxel-sensitive LAD cases. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the relative mRNA level of HDAC1 (A) and

HDAC4 (B) in docetaxel-sensitive (n=31) and insensitive (n=37) LAD tissues. HDAC1 (C) or HDAC4 (D) and miR-200b mRNA levels
were inversely correlated in 68 LAD tissues as determined by linear regression analysis. Spearman rank test rho and P values (2-tailed)
were shown. The HDAC1/4 level was normalized to GAPDH and miR-200b was normalized to U6. **P < 0.01.

reverses in vivo chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells, and (6) HDAC1/4, inversely correlated with
miR-200b, is upregulated in docetaxel-insensitive LAD
tissues compared with docetaxel-sensitive LAD tissues.
Taken together, we conclude that the novel HDAC1/4/
Sp1/miR-200b/E2F3 regulatory axis contributes to
chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
Aberrant histone hypoacetylation at the promoters
of numerous tumor suppressors has been reported in
previous studies [26, 31]. Based on the homology to yeast
proteins, the family of HDAC enzymes is classified into
three main classes: class I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), class
II (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9, 6 and 10) and class IV (HDAC 11)
[32]. So far, inhibitors of class I, II and IV HDACs have
been intensively researched, and two HDAC inhibitors,
vorinostat and romidepsin, have already been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for cancer treatment
[33]. The two HDAC inhibitors, VPA, quite active against
HDACs 1–5, 7 and 9, and TSA, efficient against HDACs
1–7 and 9 [33], were used in the present study. Both TSA
and VPA significantly restored the expression of miR-200b
and reversed chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells. Generally, HDACs lack a DNA binding domain and
are unable to bind to DNA directly, and thus they interact
with DNA through specific proteins. 
Sp1 is a highly evolutionarily conserved
transcription factor that specifically recognizes the GC box
(GGGGCGGGG). Sp1 participates in the transcriptional
regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation,
apoptosis, differentiation, and transformation [34-36]. Sp1
can recruit HDAC4 to the promoter of miR-200a, resulting
in silencing of miR-200a and promoting the proliferation
and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [28].
Also, Sp1 is able to recruit HDAC1 to the promoter of
phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome
ten (PTEN), which then inhibits PTEN expression and
enhances cancer cell migration and invasion [37]. In this
study, we identified multiple Sp1 binding sites in the two
promoters of miR-200b, and inhibition of HDAC1 and
HDAC4 significantly increased luciferase activities of
luciferase constructs with the two indicated promoters in
a Sp1-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that Sp1
was able to recruit HDAC1/4 to the promoters of miR200b in vivo, and inhibition of HDAC1/4 increased the
histone-H3 acetylation level at the miR-200b promoters
in a Sp1-dependent manner. Here, p21 was used as a
positive control [38]. Our study also revealed that HDAC1
and HDAC4 are significantly upregulated in docetaxelresistant LAD cells compared with parental cells, and
inhibition of HDAC1 or HDAC4 significantly enhances
miR-200b levels, at least partially in a Sp1-dependent
manner. Thus, these results suggest that Sp1 is a crucial
transcription factor responsible for regulating miR-200b
expression by HDAC1/4 in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
E2F3 transcription factor, a member of the E2F
family, has been reported to play an important role in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the regulation of cell proliferation, clonogenic activity,
survival and cell cycle distribution [39-42]. Our previous
work demonstrated that suppression of E2F3 is a potential
mechanism by which miR-200b reverses chemoresistance
of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells [18]. In the present
work, we showed that downregulation of HDAC1/4
inhibited E2F3 expression, suppressed cell proliferation,
promoted cell apoptosis, and induced G2/M cell cycle
arrest partially through the miR-200b pathway. Generally,
HDAC repression activates gene transcription through
forming an open chromatin structure. However, HDAC
inhibition can also induce repressive histone modifications
through recruitment of a corepressor complex such as pRB
to the promoter region [43]. Other reports have shown
that an antitumor dose of HDAC inhibitors can only affect
less than 10% of the expressed genes in malignant cells
[44]. Here, HDAC1 repression significantly decreased
E2F3 expression, which might be largely because of the
following: first, HDAC1 might reduce E2F3 expression
by recruitment of the corepressor complex to the E2F3
promoter region; second, HDAC1 might not be the
specific HDAC responsible for histone modifications at the
promoter region of E2F3, and instead HDAC1 decreases
E2F3 expression by upregulation of certain miRNAs
including miR-200b, which then post-transcriptionally
regulate the expression of E2F3 gene.
Aurora-A, a Ser/Thr kinase involved in regulating
cell cycle progression, and survivin, an apoptosisassociated gene, have been reported to be transcriptionally
activated by the E2F3 transcription factor [29, 30,
45]. In our study, we showed that both HDAC1 and
HDAC4 repression significantly inhibited survivin
expression by reducing the activity of the survivin
promoter via downregulating E2F3 expression in a
miR-200b-dependent manner and reducing the amount
of E2F3 protein binding to this promoter. Interestingly,
only HDAC4 but not HDAC1 repression could inhibit
Aurora-A expression by reducing the activity of Aurora-A
promoter via downregulating E2F3 expression in a miR200b-dependent manner and thus reducing the amount of
E2F3 protein binding to this promoter. Possible reasons
for the inability of HDAC1, an upstream regulator of
E2F3, to decrease Aurora-A in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells are as follows. First, a growing body of literature
indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are
key players in gene regulation, therefore lncRNAs and
HDAC1 may act in a coordinated fashion to regulate gene
expression, which may offset the effects of E2F3 on the
regulation of Aurora-A. Second, except for E2F3, HDAC1
and other transcription factors such as E4TF1, hypoxiainducible factor-1α and p53 may directly or indirectly act
in a coordinated fashion to regulate Aurora-A expression.
The precise reason underlying the lack of HDAC1 effect
on Aurora-A expression is still unclear and needs to be
elucidated in future research. Together these findings
suggest that repression of HDAC1/4 suppresses cell
3344

proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis, and induces G2/M
cell cycle arrest by downregulation of E2F3, Aurora-A
and survivin, at least partially through the miR-200bdependent pathway.
To further illustrate the roles of HDAC1/4/miR-200
in docetaxel-resistance of LAD patients, we evaluated the
expression of HDAC1/4 in LAD tissues from patients who
received docetaxel-based chemotherapies, and showed that
the expression level of HDAC1/4 mRNA in docetaxelsensitive LAD tissues was significantly lower than that
in docetaxel-insensitive tissues. Meanwhile, HDAC1/4
was inversely correlated with miR-200b in LAD tissues.
We further showed that high HDAC1/4 expression
was correlated with poor PFS of LAD patients. Taken
together, these data, along with previous observations that
downregulation of miR-200b was involved in docetaxel
resistance of LAD, support the hypothesis that the
novel HDAC1/4/miR-200b/E2F3 signaling contributes
to chemoresistance of LAD cells. Therefore, targeting
this signaling is a potential strategy for reversing the
chemoresistance in human LAD.

mL/min administered every 3 weeks for a maximum of 5
cycles [18]. Tissue samples were divided into “sensitive”
(complete or partial response) and “insensitive” (stable or
progressive disease) groups based on the patient responses
assessed by medical image analysis and detection of serum
tumor markers after 4 or 5 cycles of docetaxel-based
chemotherapy [18].

Construction of plasmids and transfection of
oligonucleotides or plasmids
The pcDNA3.1-HDAC1 and pcDNA3.1-HDAC4
plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. Jun Lu (Northeast
Normal University, China) and Professor Shu-han Sun
(Second Military Medical University, China) [28],
respectively. The two promoters of miR-200b, located
~4 kb and ~2 kb upstream of the 5′-stem loop, have been
reported in previous studies [20, 48]. The core regions of
the two promoters are located at chr1:1087797-1088137
(341 bp) and chr1:1089316-1090354 (1039 bp (UCSC
Genome Browser, March 2006) [20, 48]. The two core
regions were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGL3basic vector (Promega, San Luis, CA, USA) using KpnI
and HindIII sites, and the resulting plasmids were named
(pGL3) promoter-1 and promoter-2. Two open databases
(Consite and PROMO) were used to analyze the core
regions of the two promoters, and multiple Sp1 binding
sites were detected Mutation of Sp1 bingding site-mutant
constructs were generated by use of the QuikChange
XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La
Jolla, CA, USA). All primer sequences are presented in
Supplementary Table 1. All vectors were confirmed by
DNA sequencing.
The single core region of the Aurora-A promoter
(–96/+354), as confirmed in a previous work [29], was
cloned into the pGL3-basic vector using MluI and BglII
sites. This core region contains E2F3 binding sites [29].
The primer pairs used for generating the E2F3 binding
site mutant pGL3-Aurora-A (–96/+354) vectors (E2F31mut and E2F3-2mut) are presented in Supplementary
Table 1. The DNA fragment corresponding to –165/+1 of
the survivin promoter amplified by PCR was cloned into
the pGL3-basic vector using KpnI and HindIII sites. The
primer pairs are presented in Supplementary Table 1. All
vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The siRNA-HDACs, siRNA-NC, miR-200b
inhibitor, miR-200b inhibitor control, miR-200b mimics,
miR-200b mimics control and siRNA-Sp1 were purchased
from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The primers
pairs used for sh-control, sh-HDAC1 and sh-HDAC4
are presented in Supplementary Table 2. All sh-RNA
vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were
transfected with si-RNA Mate (GenePharma, China) or
Turbofect Transfection Reagent (Thermo Scientific, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
