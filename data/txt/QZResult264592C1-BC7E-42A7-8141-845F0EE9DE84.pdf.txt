Abstract

Author Manuscript

Aneuploidy, a state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes, is a form of large-effect mutation
able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions1,2. Here we investigate whether
pleiotropic stress could in turn induce aneuploidy in budding yeast. We show that while diverse
stresses can induce an increase in chromosome instability (CIN), proteotoxic stress, caused by
transient Hsp90 inhibition or heat-shock, drastically elevated CIN to produce karyotypically
mosaic cell population. The latter effect is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for Hsp90
chaperon complexes in kinetochore assembly3,4. Continued growth in the presence of Hsp90
inhibitor resulted in emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drugresistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes
located on chromosome XV. Short-term exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to
unrelated cyto-toxic compounds through different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These
findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable
of fueling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in
regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.

How cells maintain stable phenotypes and yet can adapt to diverse stress conditions through
heritable change is a question with broad implications in evolution and disease progression.
In prokaryotes, while the genome is propagated with high fidelity under normal conditions,
extensive studies have demonstrated that different modes of genetic variation can be directly
induced by stress, fueling stress adaptation 5. Recent work has revealed that one form of
adaptive mutation in eukaryotic cells is the alteration of chromosome copy number, or
aneuploidy 1,2,6. Aneuploid yeast has been observed in diverse laboratory1, industrial 7,8,9
and natural 8 environments. Aneuploidy leads to expression changes of many genes at levels
that largely scale with gene copy number changes, bringing about dramatic phenotypic
variation in a karyotype-specific manner under diverse growth conditions 6. These findings

suggest that to maintain phenotypic stability, karyotype stability must be ensured, and
indeed intricate mechanisms have evolved to achieve highly accurate chromosome
segregation to prevent CIN during mitotic proliferation. Furthermore, as aneuploids are
known to exhibit growth disadvantage compared to euploids under stress-free
conditions 6,10, the pre-existing karyotype diversity in a euploid population is likely to be
limited for rapid adaptation when exposed to stressful environments. This raises the question
of whether the cellular mechanisms ensuring chromosome transmission fidelity may be
relaxed under stress, thus allowing the emergence of karyotypic diversity to fuel rapid
cellular adaptation.

To test whether stress conditions in general could increase the rate of whole chromosomal
instability, we exposed haploid yeast cells to chemicals inducing various types of pleiotropic
stress (Supplementary Table 1) for 12-14 hours and quantified chromosome loss rate by
using the selection-neutral, chromosome fragment (CF)-based colony color assay (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Information) 11. This initial screen revealed that many
stress conditions, including hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress), cycloheximide
(translational stress), tunicamycin (ER stress), etc., elevated the chromosome loss rate to a
level similar to that caused by benomyl, a microtubule inhibitor (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly,
radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor 12, was by far the most effective CIN inducer: the chromosome
loss rate (7.4×10-2/cell division) was hundreds of times above the control (2×10-4/cell
division), even at a radicicol concentration (10 μg/ml or 27 μM) with only minor effect on
growth (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that red
colonies induced by radicicol had lost the whole CF (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Two of the 13
tested red colonies were confirmed to have also gained chromosome (Chr) X or Chr XI
(Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).

A similar aneuploidy-inducing effect was also observed with macbecin II, a structurally
distinct Hsp90 inhibitor (Fig.1b) 13. Deletion of one copy of Hsp90 genes, HSP82 showed
enhanced CF loss compared to the wild type in the presence of radicicol or macbecin II (Fig.
1b). Interestingly, deletion of STI1, the yeast homolog of mammalian Hop and a cochaperone of Hsp90, resulted in significantly elevated CIN even at a concentration of
radicicol too low to induce CIN on its own (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Heat is a
common environmental stress known to tax Hsp90 function 14. Heat-shock for 90 seconds at
50.9°C induced subsequent CF loss at a rate comparable to that by pharmacological
inhibition of Hsp90 (Fig. 1a). These results confirmed that Hsp90 stress is a potent inducer
of aneuploidy. Hsp90 chaperon complexes are crucial facilitators of many cellular
functions15. Previous biochemical studies suggested that Hsp90 is important for the
activation of Ctf13 and assembly of the CBF3 inner kinetochore complex 3. Most CBF3
complex components, as well as the two co-chaperones involved in Ctf13 activation,
showed haploinsufficiency toward radicicol (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Radicicol disrupted
the kinetochore localization of Cep3 but had less effect on Ndc10, thus altering the
stoichiometry of CBF3 complex at the kinetochore (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 5c, d, e). In
addition to the CBF3 complex, Hsp90 interacts with several other pathways that could affect
chromosome transmission fidelity, including the spindle assembly checkpoint 16 (see
below).

Hsp90 taxation has previous been proposed to impact evolution by releasing phenotypic
variation from pre-stored genetic diversity in the population and by transposon
mobilization 15,17. Does Hsp90 inhibition also promote adaptation through induction of
aneuploidy? As a first test, a diploid strain was grown in the presence of high concentration
of radicicol and 3 largest radicicol-resistant (Radr) colonies were selected and reconfirmed
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Information). Karyotyping revealed
that all 3 Radr colonies were aneuploid with a dominant karyotype feature: all 3 Radr
colonies, which adapted independently, contained one or two additional copies of Chr XV
(Fig.2a). A haploid Chr XV disomy strain, generated by genetic manipulation 10, also
showed strong resistance to radicicol (Fig. 2b). A previous genome-wide screen identified a
set of genes exhibiting haploinsufficiency toward macbecin II, among which 2 of the top
genes are located on Chr XV: STI1 and PDR5, a pleiotropic drug pump 16. We deleted a
single copy of STI1 or PDR5 gene from Radr colony 3, trisomy for Chr XV. Growth
measurements showed that either deletion abolished more than 50% of the growth rate
gained by Chr XV trisomy over diploid in the presence of radicicol (Fig. 2c). A single copy
of STI1 and/or PDR5 was then introduced into the parental diploid strain. An extra copy of
each gene mildly but significantly increased radicicol resistance, but their combination
drastically improved radicicol resistance (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7). These results
indicate that Chr XV gain directly confers radicicol resistance through increased copy
number of STI1 and PDR5, and possibly also other genes carried on this chromosome (e.g.,
SGT1).

We next tested if the karyotype diversity produced by Hsp90 stress-induced CIN could fuel
adaptation to various other stress conditions. A karyotypically mosaic yeast cell population
(∼1/3 of the population were aneuploid with different karyotypes, Supplementary Fig. 8c)
was generated by growing a diploid strain under moderate Hsp90 stress (20μg/ml Radicicol)
for 2 days. This population was then tested for enhanced adaptability toward other stress
conditions, including the presence of growth inhibiting concentrations of fluconazole,
tunicamycin, or benomyl, over a control homogeneous euploid population (see experimental
scheme in Supplementary Fig. 8a). The radicicol-pretreated population did not show any
growth advantage over the control diploid (vehicle pre-treated) on drug-free plates (Fig. 3a,
Ctrl). However, on each of the different drug-containing plates, the radicicol pre-treated
populations demonstrated drastically enhanced colony viability and frequency to form large
drug-resistant colonies than the vehicle-pretreated population (Fig. 3a, b, c).

Author Manuscript

Twenty one colonies were picked from the vehicle control plates bearing the radicicolpretreated population, and out of these 12 were aneuploid, whereas none (0/9) from the
control plate bearing the vehicle-pretreated population were aneuploid (Fig.3d, e,
Supplementary Fig. 8d, e). The vast majority (17/18) of the large colonies karyotyped from
the drug plates bearing the radicicol-pretreated population were aneuploid (Fig. 3e). The
drug-resistant colonies from the vehicle-pretreated population were also aneuploid (Fig. 3d).
Importantly, the aneuploid colonies resistant to the same drug showed obvious karyotypic
commonalities and tend to cluster together based on karyotype similarity (Fig.3e,
Supplementary Fig. 9). For example, 4 of the 5 aneuploid colonies from fluconazole plates
karyotyped gained an extra copy of Chr VIII, which carries Erg11, encoding an ergostrol

biosynthetic enzyme known to confer fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans 18. Losing
a copy of Chr XVI is a predominant karyotype change among the tunicamycin-resistant
colonies (seen in 10/12 karyotyped, Fig. 3d). Of the 12 benomyl-resistant colonies, 10
demonstrated karyotype clustering with 6 of them losing one Chr XII, but it appears that
more than one karyotypic pattern could confer benomyl resistance. This however is
consistent with our previous observation of phenotypic convergence of distinct karyotypic
patterns 6. All the above common karyotype features were significantly (Mantel-Haenszel
tests) enriched in drug resistant colonies but not the starting radicicol-pretreated population
prior to selection on drug plates (Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Fig. 8e), suggesting an
association of specific karyotypes with resistance to certain drugs.

Author Manuscript

To further assess the selective advantage of aneuploidy and karyotype dynamics under
varying stress levels, two single Chr XVI monosomy colonies from a tunicamycin plate
were streaked on drug-free plates. Colonies of two distinct sizes emerged, with the small
ones being predominant (Fig.4a). Karyotyping showed that the small colonies represented
Chr XVI monosomy, whereas the rare large colonies had gained back the missing Chr XVI
and returned to diploid (Fig 4b, Supplementary Fig. 10a). Tunicamycin resistance was
tightly linked to Chr XVI monosomy: all of the small colonies were tunicamycin resistant
while the growth of the big colonies was abolished by tunicamycin (Fig 4c, Supplementary
Fig. 10b, c, d). This result shows that an adapted aneuploid population also has the potential
to return to euploid state when the stress condition is attenuated, suggesting that aneuploidy
is not only a readily accessible mutation with large phenotypic impacts but is also reversible.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, the above results demonstrated that stress-induced chromosome instability,
leading to aneuploidy, is a mechanism of stress-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes with
high adaptive value to diverse perturbations (Supplementary Figure 1). By far Hsp90
inhibition is the most potent inducer of aneuploidy among the stress conditions tested. This
may be due to a broad but critical involvement of Hsp90 in pathways governing
chromosome transmission fidelity and cell division 16. For example, the mitotic checkpoint
gene MAD2 is a genetic interaction hub sensitive to Hsp90 perturbation 16. MAD2 deletion
was also sufficient to lead to rapid emergence of fluconazole-resistant colonies bearing an
extra copy of Chr VIII (Supplementary Figure 11). As Mad2 requires the CBF3 complex for
its activity at the kinetochore 19, the exceptionally high-level CIN induced by Hsp90
inhibitors may be explained by a combined effect of interference with both kinetochore
assembly and the checkpoint monitoring spindle defects. It is presently unknown whether
the other stress conditions induce CIN through similar or different cellular targets.

Author Manuscript

The Hsp90 chaperon complex specializes in modulating the stability and function of many
important regulatory and structural proteins 16. As a result, Hsp90 acts as a capacitor
facilitating evolutionary adaptation by unleashing the effects of pre-existing mutations when
Hsp90 activity is taxed under mild stress 14,15. Strong Hsp90 inhibition also induces
phenotypic variation through transposon activation in Drosophila 17. The results presented
in this work reveal a new role for Hsp90 in adaptive evolution - as the guardian of
chromosomal stability, the inhibition of which could trigger de novo karyotypic diversity
leading to rapid adaptation through aneuploidy. We note that our observed induction of
aneuploidy required more potent Hsp90 inhibition than that required to reveal phenotypic

effects of pre-existing mutations 14. As the function of Hsp90 chaperon complex in
kinetochore assembly is conserved in mammalian species 4,20, the Hsp90 stress-induced
aneuploidy may be a mechanism of cellular adaptation affecting a wide range of organisms.

Methods Summary
Yeast strains are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Standard genetic techniques were used for
yeast strain construction. All deletions were verified by genomic PCR, and all aneuploid
transformants were re-karyotyped by qPCR, and those retaining the original karyotype were
used for experiments. Yeast qPCR karyotyping was performed as previously described 6.
Briefly, the chromosome copy number was inferred from qPCR with sets of primers located
on peri-centrimeric regions. aCGH was performed on either a home-made spot array.
A detailed description of all methods is provided in Supplementary Information.
