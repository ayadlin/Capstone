Abstract
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression in bone
marrow cells (BMC) was up-regulated upon exposure to
interleukin 6, lipopolysaccharide, or tumor-associated factors.
But, how the up-regulated SOCS3 affects differentiation of
BMCs is incompletely characterized. Here, we showed that
SOCS3 promoted BMCs to intently differentiate into CD8 T
cells. Importantly, lung can be as one athymus tissue for the
BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T cells. Notch1 plays a critical
role in the differentiation from SOCS3-transfected BMCs to
CD8+ T cells. We conclude that the up-regulated SOCS3 in
some pathologic conditions, such as tumor and inflammation,
might promote BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T lymphocytes
in lung tissue via up-regulating Notch1 expression. This may
represent a new mechanism against diseases such as tumor.

Introduction
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), alternatively called
cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein-3, belongs to the SOCS
family of proteins. SOCS3 contains an NH2 terminal region, a
central SH2 domain, and a COOH terminal motif called the SOCS
box (1, 2). The SH2 domain is responsible for direct or competitive
inhibition of signaling proteins by interacting with the Janusactivated kinases (JAK) or blocking signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STAT) access to docking sites on the
receptors (2). SOCS box is thought to be involved in protein
degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (3). Recently,
Babon and colleagues (1) described a 35-residue unstructured PEST
motif insertion, a sequence rich in Pro, Glu (and Asp), Ser, and Thr,
which increases SOCS3 turnover and affects its degradation
pathway (1). Thus, SOCS3 protein possesses several functional
regions to regulate cellular growth, development, differentiation,
and survival through multiple pathways. SOCS3 has been shown to
specifically inhibit signaling by IFN-g, interleukin-6 (IL-6) family
of cytokines (4–7), and can act as a negative regulator of
inflammatory responses (8, 9). It is a critical regulator of cytokine
signaling and JAK/STAT pathway (10).
Unlike with SOCS1(11), the studies of SOCS3 for its effect on the
differentiation of hematopoietic cells was hindered because mice

lacking SOCS3 die during embryogenesis as the result of a placental
defect by an enhanced activation of the leukemia inhibitory factor
signaling pathway (7, 12). However, SOCS3 has been shown as a
physiologic negative regulator for granulopoiesis, granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor receptor signaling (13). SOCS3 is also
essential in the regulation of fetal liver erythropoiesis (14). Because
SOCS3 is selectively expressed in Th2 cells (15, 16), the role of
SOCS3 in Th2 cell biology has also been assessed by transgenic
mice made using MyC-tagged SOCS3 (16). The conditional
knockout (SOCS3 is absent only in mammary gland, salivary gland,
seminal vesicle, skin, B cells, and T cells) studies show that SOCS3
is an essential negative regulator of IL-23 signaling, which
constrains the generation of Th17 differentiation (17). Using
DeltaLck/DeltaLck mice, which lack SOCS3 in T/natural killer T
cells, Brender and colleagues found that SOCS3-deficient CD8 T
cells showed greater proliferation than wild-type cells in response
to T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation despite normal activation of
signaling pathways downstream from TCR or CD28 receptors (18).
Thus, SOCS3 indeed plays an important role not only in the
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells but also in differentiation of T-cell subsets. SOCS proteins are rapidly induced by
cytokines, such as IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-10, and also
lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 19–21). We previously reported that
tumor-associated factors could promote the expression of SOCS3
in bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DC; ref. 22). Here, we
found that SOCS3 expression in bone marrow cells (BMC) is also
up-regulated by tumor-associated factors, IL-6, and LPS. We
hypothesized that elevated SOCS3, upon exposure to some
pathologic factors, might affect the differentiation of BMCs.
Indeed, studies found that SOCS3 can promote BMCs to
differentiate into CD8+ T cells in lung tissue via up-regulating
Notch1 expression, likely representing another kind of BMC-based
immune response against diseases.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Four-week-old to 6-wk-old female C57BL/6, BALB/c mice and
athymic nu/nu mice (Beijing Animal Center) were maintained in a
pathogen-free animal facility at least 1 wk before use. Experiments were
performed in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Cells, reagents, antibodies, and flow cytometric analysis. The mouse
ovarian surface epithelial cell line 1D8 provided by Roby (23) was described
in our previous paper (24). Lewis tumor cells were from American Type
Culture Collection, propagated in C57BL/6 mice, cultured in Eagle’s MEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine.
Single-cell suspension was prepared from peripheral blood, bone
marrow, spleen, and lung. Recipients were sacrificed at the indicated time
points. RBCs in these tissues were lysed in hypotonic buffer. To assess cell
populations, the cells were collected in ice-cold PBS and incubated with

SOCS3 Promotes CD8+ T-Cell Differentiation
the following antibodies: FITC-conjugated or PE-conjugated anti-TCR ah
(H57-597), CD4 (L3T4), CD8a (Ly-2), CD11c (N418), CD11b (M1/70), Gr-1
(RB6-8C5), CD19 (1D3), B220 (RA36B2), I-Ab (25-9-17), and MAC-3 (M3/84).
All of these antibodies were purchased from BD Bioscience. Cells were then
washed twice and resuspended in PBS with 1% paraformadehyde and 1%
FCS and kept at 4jC before flow cytometric analysis. For FITC-labeled antiV5 antibody, the cells were fixed, penetrated, and stained using FITClabeled anti-V5 antibody.
Cocultures of murine BMCs with lung tissue cells or OP9 stromal
cells. Murine BMCs were prepared according to previous reported method
(24). RBCs were lysed in hypotonic buffer. CD8+ and CD4+ T and B
lymphocytes were deleted using CD4 T cell–positive, CD8 T cell–positive,
and B cell–positive selected magnetic beads (MACS) according to the
described protocol. After deletion, the ratio of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and
B cells in BMCs was <1%. Besides especially indicated, CD4 T cell–free, CD8
T cell–free, and B cell–free BMCs were used in the experiments.
For the preparation of a single lung tissue cell, lung tissue was digested
using a modification of the procedure of Corti and colleagues (25), in which
the main stem bronchus was cannulated using a 23-gauge angiocatheter
and instilled with 1 mL of dispase (2.4 units/mL; Roche Diagnostics)
followed immediately by 1% low-melt agarose in PBS at 42jC. This lung was
placed on ice for 2 min, after which it was digested with an additional 1 mL
of dispase for 45 min at room temperature, minced in DMEM supplemented
with 100 units/mL DNase I (Roche Diagnostics), and passed through a
40-Am filter and a 22-Am nytex mesh (Sefar America). The cells were
centrifuged at 800  g for 10 min, after which RBCs were lysed. The cells
were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 3% FCS
and 5 mmol/L EDTA at 100,000/mL. After CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells,
and sometimes CD11C+ DCs, CD11C+ B220+ PDCA-1+ DCs (plasmacytoid
DCs), or CD11C+ MAC-3+ macrophages were deleted using magnetic beads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.), the prepared lung tissue cells were used to induce
differentiation of BMCs into CD8+ T lymphocytes.
Coculture of BMCs with OP9 stromal cell or lung tissue cells were
performed according to the reported method (26). 1  106 CD4 T cell–free,
CD8 T cell–free, and B cell–free murine BMCs were added per individual sixwell plate confluent with either DP-9-DL1 cells, OP9-control cells kindly
provided by Dr. Zuniga-Pflucker (University of Toronto), or lung tissue cells.
RPMI 1640 was supplemented with 20% FCS plus 100 units/mL penicillin
and streptomycin. Cocultures were disappregated by vigorous pipetting and
passaged through a 70-Am filter to reduce stromal cell line aggregates and
eliminate contaminating OP9 cells. All cocultures were performed in the
presence of 5 ng/mL IL-7 and 5 ng/mL Flt3L (Peprotech).
Transfection and transplantation. Transfection of BMCs from C57BL/
6 or BALB/c mice with different plasmid structures were performed using
nucleofection approach according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Amaxa).
Transfection efficiency after 24 h may reach 45% (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Approximately, 1  107 cells in 500 AL of PBS were transplanted into lethally
irradiated (1,000 rad) 4-wk-old to 6-wk-old female syngeneic recipients
through tail blood vessel. Three weeks later, peripheral blood cells, spleen
cells, BMCs, and other tissue cells, such as lung tissue cells, were prepared
for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis by fluorescence staining.
pcDNASOCS3, pcDNASOCS1, and pcDNASOCS3 #129-161 plasmid.
pcDNA3.1TOPOV5SOCS3 and pcDNA3.1TOPOV5SOCS1 were constructed
by cloning murine SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes using the pcDNA3.1/V5-HisTopo kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Primers
were used for cloning SOCS1 and SOCS3 (Supplementary Table S1). pcDNA
contained irrelative sequence ( forward sequence, ACCATGGGATCTGAT
AAAGCGGCC) as control structure. SOCS3 mutants lacking aa129-161
(SOCS3Daa129-161) was done by two-step PCR and then cloned into pcDNA
using the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO kit. Primers used were listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Primers 1# and 4# were used to amplify 5¶ end
fragment. The 2# and 3# primers were used to amplify the 3¶ terminal
fragment. Primers 1# and 2# were used to amplify the SOCS3 mutants
lacking aa129-161. The sequences of cloned SOCS1, SOCS3, and
SOCS3Daa129-161 were finally confirmed.
pNK-SOCS3 small interfering RNA vector. pFIV-H1/U6-copGFPdouble promoter-small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector (SBI

System Biosciences) was used to construct siRNA plasmid, named pNKsiRNA-GFP vector. Double-promoter siRNA cassette was designed using the
protocol described at the Ambion site4 and inserted in pNK-siRNA-GFP
expression vector. Specific mSOCS3 sequences targeted include sequence
1#: GAACCTACGCATCCAGTGT and sequence 2#: GCTGGTGCACCACTACATG. Specific murine Notch1 sequences targeted include sequence1#:
GGAAGCTAAGGACCTCAAG and sequence 2#: GGACATGACCAGTGGCTAC. The nonsilencing control siRNA is an irrelevant siRNA with random
nucleotides (ACTATCTAAGTTACTACCC). Searches of the mouse genome
database (BLAST) were carried out to ensure that the sequence would not
target other gene transcripts. Cells were transfected with the siRNA
structures using mouse immature DC nucleofector kit (Amaxa) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfection efficiency after 24 h was over 40%
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Reverse transcription–PCR analysis. Total cellular RNA was prepared
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNA clean up with RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen), as recommended by the manufacturer. Reverse
transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by SuperScript one-step RTPCR with platinum Taq according to the protocol provided (Invitrogen).
Amplification conditions included cDNA synthesis and predenaturation
(one cycle: 50jC for 15 min, 94jC for 2 min), PCR amplification (40 cycles:
denature 94jC for 15 s, anneal 55jC for 30 s, extend 72jC for 1 min/kb), and
final extension (one cycle: 72jC for 10 min). The primers used were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Western blotting analysis. Cells were harvested and washed twice with
cold PBS, and 1  106 pelleted cells were disrupted on ice in lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L NaOV4,
0.5% Triton, 0.1 Ag/AL pepstatin, 0.1 Ag/AL antipain, 0.1 Ag/AL aprotinin,
2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were separated on a 10%
denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred on a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was saturated for 1 h at
room temperature in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) supplemented with
different concentrations of nonfat dried milk (Sigma-Aldrich). Hybridizations of primary antibody were carried out for 1 h at room temperature
in blocking buffer and polyclonal rabbit anti-actin antibody (1:500; SigmaAldrich) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-T/3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). The protein-antibody complexes were detected using the peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue was frozen in ornithine carbamyl
transferase (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek), cut into 6-Am to 8-Am
sections and collected on Frost Plus microscope slides (VWR Scientific).
After air drying for at least 2 h, the tissue was immersed for 20 min in cold
acetone ( 20jC), rinsed in PBS, and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Expression of Notch ligand y-like 1 or y-4 was detected
by using the rabbit anti-mouse y-like 1 or y-4 antibodies (Rockland).
Secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz and diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA, and 10%
normal mouse serum were used to detect protein-antibody complexes.
Slides were developed using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine and then stained with
hematoxylin. Images were acquired using a Nikon Microphot-SA microscope equipped with a 20/0.5 objective lens and a Nikon FX-35DX
camera (Nikon) with SPOT 3.0.2 software (Diagnostic Instruments).
ELISA. Commercial sandwich ELISA kits were used for quantitation of
IFNg (Pierce Endogen). The absorbance of each sample was measured at
450 nm using a SpectraMax 190 ELISA plate reader. Cytokine levels were
quantified from three titrations using standard curves and expressed in
pg/mL.

Figure 1. SOCS3 promotes murine BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T lymphocytes. A, LPS, IL-6, or tumor-associated factors up-regulated SOCS3 expression of
murine BMCs. Freshly isolated BMCs (2  106/well) were cultured in medium with 10 ng/mL IL-6 (R&D Systems) or 100 ng/mL LPS (Sigma) for 24 h. Contr., untreated
BMCs; Tu.Sup1, BMCs cultured with 1D8 tumor cell in transwell plate for 24 h; Tu.Sup2, BMCs cultured with CT-26 colon cancer cells in transwell plate for 24 h.
For transwell analysis, using transwell permeable supports with 3.0-Am pore size (Corning, Inc., Life Sciences), freshly isolated BMCs (1  106/well), and ovarian
1D8 tumor cells or CT-26 colon cancer cells (1  104/insert) were cocultured in separate chambers. SOCS3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) transcripts in murine BMCs were determined by RT-PCR (A1.1 and A2.1 ). Protein levels of SOCS3 and actin were determined by Western blot analysis
(A1.2 and A2.2 ). Mouse monoclonal anti-SOCS3 (Transduction-Becton Dickinson) was used in Western blotting analysis. B, CD8+, CD4+, and CD4+ CD8+ T-cell
populations of the peripheral blood from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with BMCs transfected using pcDNASOCS3 (SOCS3 ), pcDNASOCS1 (SOCS1 ), or control vectors
(pcDNA ) after day 21 were analyzed by staining using FITC-labeled anti-CD8 and PE-labeled anti-CD4 antibodies. Numbers in different areas indicate the percentage
of CD4+, CD8+, CD4+ CD8+ T cells of the murine peripheral blood cells. Contr., untransfected BMCs. C, SOCS3-positive cell population of the peripheral blood CD8+
T lymphocytes from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with SOCS3-transfected BMCs. SOCS3-positive cell population in the peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes of
reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with SOCS3-transfected BMCs were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining using anti-SOCS3 tagged V5 antibody (C1.3 ) or isotypic
antibody (C1.2 ). C1.1, the gated peripheral blood cells. CD8+ T cells from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with BMCs (C2.1 ) and with SOCS3-transfected BMCs (C2.3 )
under light microscope; CD8+ T cells from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with BMCs (C2.2 ) and with SOCS3-transfected BMCs (C2.4 ) under fluorescent microscope.
CD8+ T lymphocytes were separated using CD8+ T cell–positive selected magnetic beads according to the described protocol (MACS). The isolated CD8 T cells
were fixed and stained using FITC-labeled anti-V5 antibody and observed under fluorescence microscope. D, CD8 and CD4 T-cell populations of the spleen from
reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with BMCs transfected using pcDNASOCS1 (SOCS1 ), pcDNASOCS3 (SOCS3 ), or control vectors (pcDNA ) after day 21 were analyzed by
staining using PE-labeled anti-CD8, FITC-labeled anti-CD4, or FITC-labeled anti-V5 antibody. Numbers in different areas indicated the percentage of CD4+, CD8+,
CD4+ CD8+, and CD8+ V5+ T cells of the spleen from reconstituted mice. Contr., untransfected BMCs. Six mice were used per experiment group.

LPS or cocultured with ovarian 1D8 tumor cells and Lewis lung
carcinoma in separate chambers (Fig. 1A), SOCS3 expression of
BMCs was remarkably up-regulated in both transcription and
protein levels. Because of the critical roles of SOCS3 in regulating
intracellular signals, especially cytokine-related signal pathway, we
hypothesized that these disease-associated factors up-regulated
SOCS3 might affect the differentiation of BMCs. To investigate
effect of the elevated SOCS3 on the differentiation of BMCs, we

reconstituted the lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with T cell–free
and B cell–free murine BMCs, which were transfected using SOCS3
structure with high transfection efficiency (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Meanwhile, we also reconstituted mice with SOCS1 and control
plasmid structure-transfected BMCs as controls. Resultant chimeric mice were subsequently sacrificed at the indicated points after
BMC transplantation. The cells from bone marrow, spleen, and
blood were examined by flow cytometric analysis. Hemotopoietic

SOCS3 Promotes CD8+ T-Cell Differentiation

TCR ah+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, Gr1+, CD11b+, and CD11c+ cells could
be seen and were present in blood, bone marrow, and spleen after
day 21 after reconstitution by analysis of expression of the
T-lineage markers TCRah, CD4, and CD8, B-lineage marker
CD19, and the expression of myeloid lineage marker Gr1 and
CD11b or DC marker CD11c (not shown), indicating transplant
BMCs may differentiate into different kinds of blood cells in these
chimeras. Interestingly, significantly higher ratio of CD8+ T cells was
presented in blood, spleen, and bone marrow of reconstituted mice
with SOCS3-transfected BMCs compared with that of reconstituted
mice using control pcDNA or SOCS1 structure–transfected BMCs
(Fig. 1B and D and not shown), suggesting that SOCS3 can promote
BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T cells. Indeed, in peripheral blood
of reconstituted mice using SOCS3-transfected BMCs, 45% of
mouse blood CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1C, C1.3) expressed V5, a SOCS3tagged protein, whereas only <20% of V5+ CD8+ cells was detected
in peripheral blood CD8+ T cells of reconstituted mice with SOCS1
or control structure-transfected BMCs (not shown). The proportion
of CD8+ V5+ cells in the spleen of reconstituted mice with SOCS3transfected BMCs was also higher than that in the spleen of
reconstituted mice with SOCS1 or control structure-transfected
BMCs (Fig. 1D). Similar to the wild mice, higher proportion of CD8+
T cells in reconstituted athymic nu/nu mice with SOCS3-transfected BMCs was also observed in blood, spleen, and bone marrow
compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, SOCS3
likely promotes murine BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T cells. In
addition, consistent with the perspective that SOCS1 is required
for the differentiation of T cells (11), SOCS1 significantly reduced
their differentiation with lower ratio of CD8 and CD4 T-cell
population not only in reconstituted wild mice but also in
reconstituted nu/nu athymus mice with SOCS1-transfected BMCs
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2).

Silencing or deletion of PEST-like (aa129-161) motif of
SOCS3 impairs the differentiation of murine BMCs into CD8 T
cells. Next, we investigated the effect of silencing SOCS3 on the
differentiation of BMC into CD8 T cells. To silence SOCS3, SOCS3
siRNA template sequences were first linked into pNK-siRNA-GFP
vectors, which permit coexpression of siRNA and green fluorescence protein. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that
constructed pNK-siRNA vector could decrease the transcription
and expression of SOCS3 (Fig. 2A, A1 and A2). Whereas BMCs
transfected with SOCS3 siRNA structures were injected into the
lethally irradiated C57BL/6, BALB/c, or athymic nu/nu mice, the
proportion of CD8 T cell in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone
marrow were remarkably reduced at day 21 (Fig. 2A, A3 and not
shown), indicating silencing SOCS3 indeed impaired the differentiation of BMCs into CD8+ T cells.
As described above, SOCS3 significantly promotes the differentiation of BMCs into CD8 T cells, whereas SOCS1 reduced their
differentiation with lower ratio of CD8 and CD4 T-cell population,
implying the different role of SOCS3 versus SOCS1 in inducing the
differentiation of CD8 T lymphocytes. Structure analysis of SOCS1
and SOCS3 showed that PEST-like sequence identified in SOCS3
did not occur in the same location in SOCS1 (Fig. 2B, B1), implying
a possible role of PEST-like sequences in inducing differentiation of
CD8+ T cells. To determine the role of PEST-like motif in inducing
CD8+ T-cell differentiation, we successfully deleted the PEST-like
motif (aa129-161; SOCS3DDel129-161) and detected their effect on
the differentiation of BMCs. As predicted, deletion of SOCS3 PESTlike motif (aa129-161) did influence the differentiation of BMCs
with the reduced CD8+ T-cell ratio (Fig. 2B, B2). The reduced CD8+
T-lymphocyte differentiation was also observed in other reconstituted BALB/c mice and athymus/nude mice (not shown),
implying that this deletion might cause the changes of functional

A, CD8+ T-cell populations of the spleen from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with SOCS3 siRNA structure-transfected BMCs. Expression of SOCS3 and GAPDH
transcripts in BMCs was determined by RT-PCR (A1), and protein levels of SOCS3 and actin were determined by Western blot analysis (A2); CD4+, CD8+, and
CD4+ CD8+ cell populations (A3 ) of the spleen from reconstituted C57BL/6 mice with BMCs transfected using SOCS3 siRNA (pNKsiRNA ), mock siRNA (pNK ), or

structure region to interrupt the function of SOCS3. Indeed, the
closest structure appeared in the alignments of SOCS1 to
SOCS3DDel129-161, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD)
of 1.91 Å over 102 residues compared with the alignment between
SOCS3 and SOCS1 with an RMSD of 13.19 Å over 123 residues or
SOCS3DDel129-161 and SOCS3 with the RMSD of 4.78 Å over 124
residues (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Enriched accumulation of CD8 T lymphocytes appears in
lung tissue of the reconstituted mice with SOCS3-transfected
BMCs. SOCS3 could promote the differentiation of murine BMCs
into CD8 T lymphocytes in athymus/nude mice, suggesting that
SOCS3-induced CD8 T-cell differentiation is likely independent on
thymus. Thus, we further investigated role of other tissues, such
as bone marrow, lung, intestine, etc. Results showed that there
was remarkable accumulation of CD8 T cells in lung tissues of
reconstituted mice or nude mice with SOCS3-transfected BMCs
(Fig. 3; only data from nude mice were shown). In contrast to
SOCS3, the increased cell numbers of CD8 T lymphocytes did not
appear in lung tissues of those reconstituted mice with SOCS1 or
control plasmid-transfected BMCs (Fig. 3). Importantly, the flow
cytometric data in Fig. 3 also showed increased percentage of not
only CD8+ and CD4+ but also CD4+ CD8+ cells in the lungs of nude
mice reconstituted with SOCS3-transfected BMCs, implying that
CD8+ cells could be generated by BMCs in the lung tissue. But bone
marrow and intestine tissue did not reveal remarkable accumulation of CD8 T lymphocytes.
SOCS3-transfected BMCs differentiate into CD8+ T cells
in vitro coculture with lung tissue cells. To further determine the
role of lung tissue in the SOCS3-induced CD8+ T-cell differentiation,
we prepared the lung cells from lung tissue. The isolated lung
tissue cells, not including CD4, CD8+ T cells, and also B cells were

cocultured with SOCS3-transfected BMCs. The cells from coculture
were analyzed using T-cell lineage–specific markers at different
time points. The proportion of CD8+ T cells in the coculture of
SOCS3-transfected BMCs with lung cells was significantly higher
than those of SOCS1 or pcDNA control structure-transfected BMCs
(Fig. 4A) after 14 days, further supporting that lung could be as a
tissue for BMCs with up-regulated SOCS3 to differentiate into CD8+
T lymphocytes. Interestingly, higher ratio of CD8+ T cells did not be
detected in the coculture of SOCS3-transfected BMCs with DC-free
lung tissue (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4A), implying the role
of DCs in inducing CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Indeed, CD8+ T-cell
proportion in the coculture of SOCS3-transfected BMCs with y-like
1–expressing OP9 stromal cells (OP9DL1) was not higher than those
in the control vector or SOCS1-transfected BMCs (Supplementary
Fig. S4B), although OP9DL1 did support T-cell differentiation (27).
Similar to thymus (reviewed in ref. 28), lung also contains
phenotypically and functionally distinct DC populations, including
conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC; Supplementary
Fig. S5). CD11C+ MAC+ macrophages were also detected (Supplementary Fig. S5). Further investigation found that CD8+ T-cell
differentiation was mainly dependent on cDC subpopulation in lung
tissue (Fig. 4B), whereas deletion of pDC or MAC+ macrophages did
not cause remarkable effect on the proportion of CD8+ cell
population (Fig. 4B). In addition, DC supernatants did not induce
the differentiation of CD8+ from SOCS3-transfected BMCs, suggesting that the physical contact between BMCs and lung DCs is
necessary for the generation of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4B).
Notch1 plays a critical role in the differentiation of SOCS3transfected BMCs into CD8+ T cells in lung tissue. The critical
role of members of notch family in the differentiation of T
lymphocytes suggests the possible effect of SOCS3 on the expression

SOCS3 Promotes CD8+ T-Cell Differentiation

Figure 4. Lung tissue promotes SOCS3-transfected
BMCs to differentiate into CD8+ T lymphocytes.

(SOCS3 ), pcDNASOCS1 (SOCS1 ), or control

of Notchs. To detect this hypothesis, we analyzed expression of
Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4 in SOCS3-transfected BMCs.
The higher level of transcription and expression of Notch1 in the
SOCS3-transfected BMCs could be found, although other members
of Notch family, such as Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4, were not
up-regulated by SOCS3 (Fig. 5A and not shown). As controls, SOCS1
or control plasmid structure did not promote the expression of
either Notch1 or Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4 (Fig. 5A and not
shown). Both Notch1-y-like 1 (Dll1) and Notch1-y-4 interactions
condition hematopoietic progenitor differentiation by promoting
T lineage and preventing B-cell development (29, 30). We, thus,
detected expression of y-like 1 and y-4 in lung tissue. As illustrated
in Fig. 5B, lung tissue not only expressed y-like 1 but also y-4. This
was also shown in transcriptional level (not shown).
SOCS3-transfected BMCs could express high levels of Notch1,
suggesting the up-regulated Notch1 might play an important role
in CD8 T-cell differentiation from BMCs. To test this, we prepared
Notch1-targeted siRNA structure, which was shown to degrade
Notch mRNA and decease protein level (Fig. 5C). Whereas SOCS3
and Notch1-targeted siRNA structures were cotransfected into
BMCs, Notch1-targeted siRNA abrogated the roles of SOCS3 in the
differentiation of CD8 T cells from BMCs, whereas control siRNA
did not have significant effect on the SOCS3-induced differentiation (Fig. 5D). Thus, we showed that Notch1 might play a critical
role in the differentiation of SOCS3-transfected BMCs into CD8+ T
cells in lung tissue.
Enriched accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears in
lung tissue of the mice-bearing tumor. Tumor-associated factors
promote the expression of SOCS3, which induces the differentiation of BMCs into CD8 T cells. Thus, we also detected the ratio of
CD8 T cells in lung tissues of mice bearing 1D8 ovarian tumor. CD8

T-cell population also remarkably accumulated in lung tissue of the
mice bearing tumor (Fig. 6A). Finally, we characterized CD8 T cells
from lung tissues of SOCS3-transfected BMCs or mice bearing
tumor. The isolated CD8+ T cells from lung tissue had almost
similar response (Fig. 6C and D) to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
stimulation with controls, suggesting these SOCS3-induced CD8 T
cells might possess normal function.

Discussion
SOCS3 is induced and up-regulated by a number of cytokines (8).
Here, we found that some disease-associated factors, such as IL-6,
LPS, and tumor-derived factors, remarkably elevate SOCS3
expression in BMCs. Interestingly, the up-regulated SOCS3
promotes differentiation of BMCs into CD8 T cells in lung tissue.
Because a single naive CD8+ T-cell precursor can develop into
diverse effectors and memory subsets (31), the differentiation of
BMCs induced by SOCS3 into CD8 T cells may have an important
significance in defense against some diseases.
Because mice lacking SOCS3 die during embryogenesis (7, 12),
using reconstituted mice with the SOCS3-transfected BMCs, we
show the critical role of SOCS3 in inducing the differentiation of
BMCs into CD8+ T lymphocytes. SOCS3 is also essential in the
regulation of fetal liver erythropoiesis (14), generation of Th17
differentiation (17), differentiation of Th2 (16), and granulopoiesis,
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor signaling (13).
SOCS3-deficient CD8 T cells also exhibit greater proliferation than
wild-type cells in response to TCR ligation (18). Thus, SOCS3 exerts
an important role in both the differentiation of hematopoietic stem
cells into T lymphocytes and granulocytes and the differentiation
of T-cell subsets.

The differentiation and maturity of T lymphocytes may happen
outside thymus. Indeed, others also reported that, in the absence of
thymus, T-cell development from the most immature progenitor
stages was developed into complete maturation of ah T cells (32).
In vivo and in the absence of a thymus, y-1 or y-4 expression is
sufficient to promote T-cell development from the most immature
progenitor stages to complete maturation of both CD8+ and CD4+
T cells (32–35). As a significant finding, we show that lung tissues,
which express y-1 and y-4, can support differentiation of BMCs into
CD8+ T cells. There is also increasing evidence that hematopoietic
progenitor cells may traffic from bone marrow to sites of allergen
exposure in asthma and undergo in situ differentiation, contributing to ongoing airway inflammation (36).
In vitro studies found that higher ratio of CD8+ T cells in SOCS3transfected BMCs does not appear in coculturing with y-like 1 OP9
cells, suggesting involvement of other lung-associated factors.
Indeed, there are a lot of DCs (37) that might play a role in
differentiation and proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. During
thymocyte development, signals through pre-TCR induce proliferation and differentiation at early stages of maturation and,
thereafter, signals through the ah receptor complex mediate the
positive and negative selection and commitment to CD4 or CD8
lineage (38). DCs orchestrate this complex process. In vitro
coculture indeed suggests the roles of DCs in lung tissue in
differentiation of CD8+ T cells from BMCs.
Higher expression of Notch1 in the SOCS3-transfected BMCs has
an important significance in differentiation and proliferation of
BMCs into CD8+ T lymphocytes. Notch signaling plays multiple
roles to direct diverse decisions regarding cell fate during T-cell

development (34, 39, 40). Notch receptors are present in
hematopoietic precursors. Notch signaling enhances in vitro
generation of human and mouse hematopoietic precursors (34),
determines T-cell or B-cell lineage specification from a common
lymphoid precursor (41–43), and promotes expansion of CD8+ cells
(43–45). Overexpression experiments have also suggested that
constitutively active Notch1 biases thymocyte development toward
the CD8 lineage (43, 45, 46).
We, here, increase the evidence to illustrate the difference of
functional potency of SOCS3 and SOCS1. SOCS3 could promote the
differentiation of CD8 T lymphocytes from BMCs, whereas SOCS1
inhibit the differentiation of these cells. SOCS1 / mice showed
accelerated maturation of CD4+ CD8+ double-positive cells to CD4+
and CD8+ single-positive T cells, with an increased frequency of the
latter (14). Physiologically, SOCS1 is the main inducible inhibitor of
IFN signaling and, in neonatal mice, prevents the establishment of
a lethal inflammatory disease (47). Mice lacking SOCS3 die during
embryogenesis (12); however, the generation of mice conditionally
deficient for SOCS3 revealed SOCS3 to be a potent physiologic
suppressor of IL-6 but not IFN signaling (7, 8, 48). SOCS1 and
SOCS3 can bind Jaks, but the ability to inhibit their catalytic
activity is variable (reviewed in ref. 49).
In conclusion, our observation suggests one mechanism that
BMCs can differentiate into CD8+ T cells in athymus tissue as a
response against disease-associated factors, such as tumor-derived
factors (Supplementary Fig. S6). These factors can elevate SOCS3
expression in BMCs. The up-regulated SOCS3 can promote
differentiation of BMCs into CD8+ T cells by up-regulating Notch1
expression. Whereas BMCs with high level of Notch1 traffic into
