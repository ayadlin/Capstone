Abstract
Previously, we have shown that the expression of Wnt-1–
induced signaling protein-2 (WISP-2), also known as CCN5, can
be regulated by multiple stimulants in estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive breast tumor cells to exert their mitogenic action in
these cells. Here, we show that insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1), a strong mitogen, enhanced the expression of the WISP2/CCN5 gene parallel with the induction of proliferation of
ER-positive breast tumor cells. An additive effect was also seen
in combination with estrogen. Perturbation of IGF-1–induced
WISP-2/CCN5 expression by WISP-2–specific RNA interference
impaired the mitogenic action of IGF-1 on ER-positive breast
tumor cells. Furthermore, the studies have shown that the
multiple molecular cross-talks and side-talks among IGF-1R,
ER-A, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling
molecules are required to induce WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA by IGF-1
in ER-positive, noninvasive breast tumor cells. Because a pure
anti-ER ICI 182,780 is not only able to suppress the upregulation of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression by IGF-1, it also
suppresses the PI3K/Akt activity induced by IGF-1 in MCF-7
cells; we anticipate that the membrane ER receptor may
participate in this event. Collectively, these studies propose
for the first time that WISP-2/CCN5 is an integral signaling
molecule in mitogenic action of IGF-1 axis in ER-positive
human breast tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1520–6]

Introduction
Wnt-1–induced signaling protein-2 (WISP-2), also known as
CCN5, has been identified as a member of the CCN (connective
tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed) family of growth factors (1, 2). It has been implicated as
having an important role in carcinogenesis (3). Multiple studies,
from our laboratory and others, have shown that steroid hormones
(i.e., estrogen and progesterone), serum, epidermal growth factor
(EGF), and phorbol esters exhibit an inductive role in WISP-2/
CCN5 gene expression in breast cancer cell lines (4–7). Evidently,
this induction is crucial for serum- or EGF-induced, estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive breast tumor cell proliferation (4, 6).
Moreover, WISP-2/CCN5 is expressed in early stages of breast
tumors, and its expression is correlated with ER status (4).

Collectively, these emerging evidences suggest that WISP-2/CCN5
signaling might have particular relevance in the early wave of the
development of human breast cancer (4, 6).
The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; somatomedin) is a
circulating polypeptide growth factor of f7.5 kDa in size (8) and
with insulin-like activity (9). This growth factor is an increasing
focus in breast cancer research because higher levels of circulating
‘‘free’’ IGF-1 may increase breast cancer risk in premenopausal
women (10), and its action is detected in all stages of human breast
tumors (11). IGF-1 plays a critical role in breast tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (12) as well as in carcinogenesis through the modulation of multiple events including
inhibition of apoptotic cell death (11, 13, 14). Most of the physiologic
as well as pathophysiologic effects of IGF-I are transmitted via the
type-I IGF receptor (IGF-R1; refs. 15, 16), a marker for the regulation
of breast tumor growth (17, 18). IGF-1 is considered the strongest
potential growth stimulator among the growth factors responsible
for mitogenic responses in estrogen-dependent human breast
cancer and breast tumor cell lines (19, 20) but not the ER-negative
breast tumor cell lines (21). The mitogenic potential of IGF-1 in ERpositive cells can be augmented by estrogen through its receptor
(22–25), and it can be blocked by an estrogen antagonist without
inhibiting IGF-1 signaling (22, 26). A high percentage of IGF-R1
expression is detected in primary breast tumor samples, and this
expression is positively correlated with ER status (27). Animal
studies support the consequence of IGF-1 signaling in the
pathogenesis of ER-positive breast cancer. They show significantly
less growth of ER-positive MCF-7 xenograft tumors in nude mice
that lack circulating IGF-1 (28). Together, these studies suggest that
there could be a unique interacting or modulating signaling
intermediate in ER-positive breast tumor cells whose activation
by the IGF-1/IGF-R1/ER-a axis is mandatory for the IGF-1–induced
mitogenic switch in these cells. However, this common ‘‘switchman’’
has not yet been identified. Thus, the goal of the present study was
to find out whether WISP-2/CCN5 is the candidate molecule in
IGF-1 signaling pathway.
Here, we present evidence that WISP-2/CCN5 signaling is critical
for IGF-1 mitogenesis. In particular, studies show that WISP-2/
CCN5 mRNA expression is increased by the IGF-1 axis in a doseand time-dependent manner to produce mitogenic response in
ER-positive breast tumor cells. The activation of mitogenesis by
IGF-1-WISP-2 circuitry is mediated by multiple molecular side-talks
and cross-talks.

from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). PCR kits were obtained from PerkinElmer (Foster City, CA). Biolase DNA polymerase and Trizol were obtained
from Bioline (Randolph, MA) and Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY)
respectively. IGF-1R inhibitor, Tyrphostin AG1024 was obtained from Alexis
Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Antiestrogen ICI 182,780 was obtained
from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt and anti–
phosphorylated Akt polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling (Beverly, MA). Digoxigenin high prime DNA labeling and
detection kit and cell proliferation bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) ELISA
kit was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Indianapolis, IN). All
other chemicals from commercial sources were of the highest purity
available.
Cell lines and culture conditions. Human breast tumor–derived,
noninvasive, ER-positive cell lines (i.e., MCF-7 and ZR-75-1) and invasive,
ER-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were grown in DMEM
(Sigma Chemical) supplemented with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Sigma
Chemical), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Road Logan, UT), 2 mmol/L
glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 units Streptomycin (Sigma
Chemical) in a 37jC, 5% CO2 and 95% air. In each experiment, cells were
initially grown in complete media until the culture became f70%
confluent. The cells were then grown in serum and phenol red–free media
for 72 h to reach estrogen- and growth factor–free environment. The
deprived cells were exposed to stimulants or inhibitors or both as per the
requirements of the experiments.
BrdUrd incorporation assay. The BrdUrd cell proliferation assay was
done according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics) with
some modifications. Briefly, cells were pulsed with BrdUrd labeling reagent
overnight followed by fixation in FixDenat solution for 30 min at room
temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti–BrdUrd-POD (1:100
dilutions) for 90 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were incubated
in substrate solution at room temperature, and proliferation was assessed
by colorimetric detection.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and probe
synthesis. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Life
Technologies), and the extraction procedure was as described previously
(29). cDNA preparation, the sequences of primers, reverse transcriptionPCR analysis, and nonradioactive digoxigenin labeling and probe synthesis
were done essentially same as reported (6, 30).
Northern hybridization. The nonradioactive Northern blot analysis was
done according to our previous method (6). Briefly, 10 Ag of total RNA was
fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde
and was transferred to a super charged nylon membrane (Schleicher and
Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled
WISP-2/CCN5 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
gene–specific probe. Relative expressions of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNAs were
calculated by densitometric analysis using a one-dimensional image analysis
software (Kodak Image Station, version 3.6). The signal intensity of WISP-2/
CCN5 bands was normalized to the results obtained with GAPDH bands.

Total cell protein extraction and Western immunoblot analysis.
Total cell protein extraction and Western immunoblotting were carried out
as described previously (6). Briefly, the cells were incubated in cell lysis
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.4 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 mmol/L
sodium fluoride, 0.4 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 1 Ag/mL aprotinin] for 30 min at 4jC followed by centrifugation for
60 min at 4jC. Supernatants were collected as total cell protein extracts,
and protein concentrations were measured by Coomasie blue detection
method. Equal amounts of total cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transformed to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked
with super block (Pierce, Rockford, IL) followed by incubation with
appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4jC. Protein bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce), and the intensity of
the band was measured by densitometric analysis using a one-dimensional
image analysis software (version 3.6).
Short hairpin RNA synthesis, cloning, and transfection of cells.
WISP-2/CCN5–specific, double-stranded short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) or
mismatched shRNA were designed and synthesized according to our
previous method (6) or obtained from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Briefly,
oligonucleotides were annealed, and cloned into the pSilencer 1.0-U6 shRNA
expression vector. The positive clones were confirmed by PCR amplification
using a gene-specific forward primer and the T3 promoter primer. The
sequences of the shRNA are given in Table 1.
Breast tumor cells were transiently transfected with shRNAs using
Lipofectin Plus reagent (Life Technologies) according to our previous
method (4, 6). Briefly, f60% confluent cells were fed with Opti-MEM I
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 to 2 days to eliminate the endogenous
WISP-2/CCN5 protein; 10 Ag shRNA constructs were transfected in cells
with 1 mL Opti-MEM I containing Lipofectin for 24 h. The media were
replaced with Lipofectin-free fresh Opti-MEM I with or without IGF-1 (100
ng/mL) for 24 h. Cells were harvested from 25-cm2 flasks to quantitate the
RNA level of WISP-2/CCN5 and from 96-well plates assayed for cell
proliferation using BrdUrd ELISA kit. Mismatched-transfected cells or
parent cells were considered as controls.
Statistical analysis. BrdUrd cell proliferation studies were carried out in
quadruplicate wells. WISP-2 mRNA level and bioactivity studies were
repeated three to four times. Experiments for the detection of signaling
intermediates were done in triplicate wells. Results are expressed as
mean F SE, and effects were compared with untreated control cells on the
same plate or same experimental conditions. Paired Student’s t tests were
used to analyze the effect of stimulants and inhibitors. P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Figure 1. Effect of IGF-1 alone and combined effect of IGF-1 and 17h-E2 on breast tumor
cell proliferation. A, equal numbers of cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate and
were cultured in DMEM containing 10% serum (dose-dependent effect). After attachment,
the cells were serum starved for 3 d and treated with IGF-1 (1–100 ng/ml) for 24 h.
Cellular proliferation in the control and the treated cultures were measured by colorimetric
immunoassay based on BrdUrd incorporation into the cellular DNA. B, serum-starved MCF-7
cells were treated with IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) for indicated times, and cell proliferation was
determined using BrdUrd ELISA (time-dependent effect). C, serum-starved cells were
treated with IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of 17 h-E2 (10 nmol/L) for
24 h (combination effect). Cellular proliferations were measured by BrdUrd ELISA. Columns,

ER-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) as experimental cellular
models. Serum-starved cells were exposed to IGF-1 for distinct
doses (i.e., 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) for 24 h or distinct times (i.e., 24,
48, and 72 h) with a single dose (100 ng/mL) of IGF-1, and cell
proliferation was evaluated using BrdUrd ELISA assay. As shown in
Fig. 1A and B, IGF-1 exhibits mitogenic effect on ER-positive MCF7 breast tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The
significant mitogenic effect of IGF-1 was detected by 1 ng/mL dose
at 24 h, and the effect was increased along the increment of the
dose and the treatment duration. The mitogenic effect of IGF-1
was also found in ZR-75-1 ER-positive breast tumor cells (Fig. 1A).
However, this effect was undetected in ER-negative MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 1A). These findings are consistent with earlier studies
(22, 31, 32).
To explore whether IGF-1 and 17h-E2 could synergistically or
additively enhance ER-positive breast tumor cell proliferation,

serum-starved MCF-7, ZR-75-1, or MDA-MB-231 cells were
exposed to IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) or 17h-E2 (10 nmol/L), or both
stimuli for 24 h and assayed for cell proliferation. Consistent with
previous findings (33), these studies show that the treatment of
MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells with IGF-1 or 17h-E2 independently
resulted in induction of cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). Combination
treatment of MCF-7 cells or ZR-75-1 cells with IGF-1 and 17h-E2
exhibits an additive effect (i.e., combination effect of IGF-1 and
17h-E2 was equal or all most equal to the sum of the effect of each
agent) on the proliferation (Fig. 1C) rather than synergistic as
observed previously (33). This discrepancy could be due to the
application of different detection techniques. The effect was
undetected in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C).

signaling in IGF-1 mitogenesis in ER-positive breast tumor cells,
we first needed to determine if IGF-1 is able to modulate the
expression of WISP-2/CCN5 expression in MCF-7 cells. To test
this, serum-starved MCF-7 cells were exposed to different doses
of IGF-1 (i.e. 1, 10, or 100 ng/mL) for 24 h, and mRNA levels were
determined by Northern blot analysis. As revealed in Fig. 2A, the
up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression by IGF-1 was
recognized at a 10 ng/mL concentration, which was f2.5-fold
higher than vehicle-treated control. The expression levels were
elevated along with the augmentation of doses with the highest
effect detected at a 100 ng/mL dose. We extended this study and
determined the time course (i.e., up to 72 h) effect of IGF-1 on
WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA expression was amplified significantly at 2 h of exposure
and gradually augmented as the time of exposure increased
(Fig. 2B and C). Maximum induction was observed after 24 h of
exposure. Together, these studies established that IGF-1 enhanced
the WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression in MCF-7 noninvasive,
ER-positive breast tumor cells, and this induction is dose and
time dependent.
Additive effect of IGF-1 on 17B-E2–induced WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA up-regulation. Consistent with previous works (34–36),
the present studies have shown a synergistic effect of IGF-1 and
17h-E2 on ER-positive MCF-7 cell proliferation; we tested whether

IGF-1 and estrogen could synergistically activate WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. To test this, serum-starved cells
were exposed to 100 ng/mL IGF-1 or 10 nmol/L E2 or both for
24 h. Total RNA was extracted and WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA level was
measured. As expected from previous studies, WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA expression was significantly increased in 17h-E2– or
IGF-1–treated cells, respectively, compared with the cells grown
in serum-free medium (Fig. 3A). Combination treatment of MCF-7
cells with IGF-1 and 17h-E2 exert an additive effect on the
activation of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A).
IGF-1–induced up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression is mediated via IGF-1R. To determine whether IGF-1R is
required to up-regulate the WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression by
IGF-1, we explored the effect of AG1024 (10 Amol/L), a selective
IGF-1R inhibitor, on IGF-1 action. As shown in Fig. 3B, IGF-1 alone
significantly elevated WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells
compared with untreated controls, while the cells were exposed to
IGF-1 along with AG1024; the effect of IGF-1 reduces significantly.
This result indicates that up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 gene
expression by IGF-1 is IGF-1R mediated in MCF-7 cells.
Inhibition of IGF-1–induced up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA expression by a pure anti-ER. It is a well-established
phenomenon that the molecular cross-talk between peptide
growth factors and ER signaling is required to regulate some
growth factor–dependent genes (6, 37, 38). Thus, we anticipated
that similar molecular cross-talk could be allied in IGF-1–induced
regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 expression in ER-positive breast tumor
cells. To clarify this, starved MCF-7 cells were exposed to IGF-1
(100 ng/mL) alone or in combination with a pure ER antagonist,
ICI 182,780 (1 Amol/L), for 24 h followed by evaluation of WISP-2/
CCN5 mRNA levels using Northern blot analysis. As shown in
Fig. 3C, IGF-1 alone amplified WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression in
MCF-7 cells by severalfold compared with unexposed one, and this
stimulation can be reduced to the basal level or less by ICI 182,780.
However, ICI 182,780 alone has no effect on WISP-2/CCN5
expression. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that the
participation of ER is crucial for up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA in MCF-7 by IGF-1.
Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in IGF-1–
induced WISP-2/CCN5 up-regulation. To find out the involvement of signaling molecule(s) in IGF-1–induced WISP-2/CCN5
up-regulation, we exposed cells to wortmannin (100 nmol/L),
a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor or U0126
(10 Amol/L), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase/
extracellular-regulated kinase inhibitor, for 30 min before IGF-1
exposure for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, wortmannin was able to
inhibit IGF-1–induced up-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 expression,
whereas the inhibitory effect of U0126 was undetected. This study,
therefore, suggests that the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in
IGF-1 action on the transcriptional regulation of the WISP-2/CCN5
gene. Next, we needed to determine whether ER signaling
pathways are crucial in PI3K activation by IGF-1. To obtain this
information, MCF-7 cells were exposed to either IGF-1 (100 ng/mL)
or IGF-1 in combination with ICI 182,780 (1 Amol/L) for 30 and
60 min, and PI3K activity was determined by measuring total and
phosphorylated PI3K/Akt (pPI3K/Akt) protein in MCF-7 cells. As
shown in Fig. 4B, co–short exposure of IGF-1 and ICI 182, 780
resulted in markedly decreased PI3K/Akt activity compared with
IGF-1–exposed MCF-7 cells. Activity of pPI3K/Akt was almost
undetected in 10 Ag of untreated protein samples when run in
PAGE for immunodetection. The activity of PI3K/Akt increased

MCF-7 cells, whereas mismatched shRNA were unable to block
the WISP-2/CCN5 expression in these cells. After the confirmation
of the efficacy of the shRNAs, we selected shRNA4 for subsequent
studies.
Next, WISP-2/CCN5-shRNA4 or mismatch-shRNA transiently
transfected cells were grown in serum-free medium with or without
IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) in T-flask or 96-well plates for 24 h and assayed for
WISP-2 mRNA expression and cell proliferation using Northern blot
and BrdUrd ELISA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5B, shRNA4mediated inhibition of WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression in MCF-7
cells (top) resulted in significant inhibition of IGF-1–induced cell
proliferation (bottom). Thus, shRNA experiments indicate that the
mitogenic ability of IGF-1 is mediated by WISP-2/CCN5 signaling.

Discussion
A large number of studies over the last decade have revealed
the association of IGF-1–regulatory circuitry with mitogenesis and

severalfold in MCF-7 cells when exposed to IGF-1, and this induced
activity was blocked almost to the basal level by ICI 182,780 when
exposed concomitantly for 60 min. No significant changes were
detected in ICI 182, 780–exposed cells (data not shown). Thus,
this study clearly shows that a side-talk between IGF-1/IGF-1R
and unliganded ER signaling (possibly membrane associated) is
necessary for the activation of PI3K signaling by IGF-1, which
eventually enhances the WISP-2/CCN5 expression.
WISP-2/CCN5 is required for IGF-1–induced ER-positive
breast tumor cell proliferation. Given the observed effect of
IGF-1 on WISP-2/CCN5, we hypothesized that WISP-2/CCN5 signaling may contribute ER-positive breast tumor cell proliferation. To
ascertain this, first, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with
pSilencer vectors containing WISP-2–specific shRNA or mismatch
sequence, and WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA levels were evaluated in WISP-2/
CCN5–transfected and nontransfected cells. As shown Fig. 5A, the
WISP-2/CCN5–specific shRNAs (i.e., shRNA1, shRNA2, shRNA3,
and shRNA4) inhibits effectively the expression of WISP-2/CCN5 in

WISP-2/CCN5 in IGF-1 Signaling

Figure 5. IGF-1–induced WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA expression and cellular
proliferation are suppressed by WISP-2/CCN5 shRNA. A, f70% confluent
MCF-7 were grown in Opti-MEM I for 1 to 2 d and then transfected with WISP-2/
CCN5 shRNAs (i.e., shRNA1, shRNA2, shRNA3, and shRNA4 ) or mismatch
shRNA for 24 h, and WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA levels were determined using
Northern blot analysis. B, the MCF-7 cells were transfected with shRNA4 for
24 h and incubated with IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) for 24 h, and WISP-2/CCN5 mRNA
expression and cellular proliferation were determined using Northern blot
analysis (top right ) and BrdUrd ELISA (bottom left ), respectively. Mismatched
vector transfected cultures were considered as control. Columns, mean
absorbance (A 370 nm) from three separate experiments; bars, SD. P was
determined by Student’s t test. *, P < 0.001, versus vector transfected control;

carcinogenesis of breast tissue (35, 39–43). These studies have
shown that IGF-1 enhances the growth of ER-positive breast
cancer cells (31, 39), and acquisition of the malignant phenotype
in the breast is initially dependent on IGF-IR signals (39).
Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that IGF-1 actions are
entwined with estrogen/ER axis because the active participation
of ER-a in IGF-1 action is needed (21, 44), and both IGF-1 and
estrogen have been shown to share the common molecular
signaling pathways to exert their biological or pathobiological
actions in combination or alone (43). However, the defined
mechanism of why and how IGF-1 action is entwined with the
estrogen/ER axis has not yet been fully elucidated. The present
studies provide evidence indicating a novel modulating role of
IGF-1–induced WISP-2/CCN5 in mitogenic switch that is activated
by IGF-1 signaling through an ER-a–dependent pathway in breast
tumor cells.
Previously, we have shown that WISP-2/CCN5 is an important
signaling intermediate in ER-positive breast tumor cells. Its
expression is not only increased by steroid hormones or growth
factors, but its enhanced expression is also required for cell
proliferation induced by stimulants such as serum and EGF (4–6,
29, 45). Given the importance of WISP-2/CCN5, we assumed that
monitoring the WISP-2/CCN5 expression and its functional role in

IGF-1 exposed breast tumor cells might reveal a previously
unidentified mechanism associated with IGF-1–induced mitogenesis. To explore this, we first determined the effect of IGF-1 alone or in
combination with 17h-E2 on ER-positive and ER-negative breast
tumor cell proliferation. We found that IGF-1 significantly enhanced
the proliferation of ER-positive MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 human breast
tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B).
Addition of 17h-E2 with IGF-1 enhances this proliferation in an
additive fashion (Fig. 1C). The similar effect of IGF-1 was undetected
in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore,
consistent with the previous perception (21, 22, 31, 32, 34, 37, 44, 46),
our studies suggest that the mitogenic switch in breast cancer cells
by the IGF-1 axis may mediate through ER-a.
Why and how does IGF-1 exert its mitogenic action on ERpositive breast tumor cells? And why is the induction of breast
cancer cell proliferation by IGF-1/ER-a dependent? The answers to
these complex issues may be provided from the WISP-2/CCN5
mRNA expression profile of breast tumor cells treated with IGF-1
alone (Figs. 1 and 2) or in combination with estrogen (Fig. 1C and
Fig. 3A) or their inhibitors (Fig. 3B and C and Fig. 4) and from its
functional study. We found that WISP-2/CCN5, which only
expresses in ER-positive breast tumor cells (6) and participates
in serum- and growth factor–induced cell proliferation (4, 6), is
activated transcriptionally by IGF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent
fashion. This induction can be augmented by estrogen in a
synergistic manner and can be repressed by both IGF-1 and
estrogen antagonists (Fig. 1C and Fig. 3). Furthermore, targeted
down-regulation of WISP-2/CCN5 transcription by an RNA
interference approach results in perturbation of mitogenic action
of IGF-1 in ER-positive breast tumor cells (Fig. 5). Together, these
studies not only explain the above issues; these findings also likely
enlighten why IGF-1 does not exert mitogenic effect on MDA-MB231 cells (21). However, further studies are warranted to confirm
the perception.
IGF-1 has been shown to activate several different intracellular
pathways, including MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, for its
mitogenic action (47, 48). Under our experimental conditions,
only wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, is able to perturb the IGF-1
action on WISP-2/CCN5 expression (Fig. 4). Thus, this study
clearly suggests that transcriptional regulation of WISP-2/CCN5
by IGF-1 is mediated through the PI3K signaling pathway. As
there is inconsistency regarding IGF-1 action on MAPK pathway
with the previous report (49), this study implies that a crosstalk of intracellular signals may be involved in IGF-1/IGF-1R–
mediated activation of a gene associated with breast tumor cell
proliferation.
Earlier, several lines of evidences established the importance
of ER-a signaling in the IGF-1 axis–mediated mitogenic signal in
uterus and in breast tumor cells (21, 43, 44, 50). Here, we report
the findings supporting the previous works and indicate that
IGF-1 promotes activation of WISP-2/CCN5 signaling pathway in
breast tumor cells through the molecular cross-talking with ER-a
via PI3K-dependent fashion. Because a pure estrogen antagonist
is capable of blocking the activation of PI3K by IGF-1 (Fig. 4B),
it is reasonable to anticipate that the unbound membrane ER is
involved in activation of the WISP-2/CCN5 signaling pathway for
mitogenic switch in breast tumor cells.
In summary, our data provide the first evidence of the regulation
of WISP-2/CCN5 signaling by the IGF-1 axis and explored why and
how the IGF-1 axis promotes mitogenic signal in ER-a–positive
breast cells.
