Abstract
Microtubule-stabilizing and microtubule-destabilizing agents
are commonly used as anticancer agents. Although highly
effective, success with these agents has been limited due to
their relative insolubility, cumbersome synthesis/purification,
toxic side effects, and development of multidrug resistance.
Hence, the identification of improved agents that circumvent
one or more of these problems is warranted. We recently
described the rational design of a series of triazole-based
compounds as antimitotic agents. Members of this Nsubstituted 1,2,4-triazole family of compounds exhibit potent
tubulin polymerization inhibition and broad spectrum cellular cytotoxicity. Here, we extensively characterize the in vitro
and in vivo effects of our lead compound from the series
1-methyl-5-(3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-4-yl)1H-indole, designated T115. We show that T115 competes with
colchicine for its binding pocket in tubulin, produces robust
inhibition of tubulin polymerization, and disrupts the
microtubule network system inside the cells. In addition,
T115 arrests human cancer cells in the G2-M phase of cell
cycling, a hallmark of microtubule destabilizing drugs. T115
also inhibits cell viability of several cancer cell lines, including
multidrug-resistant cell lines, in the low nanomolar range. No
cytotoxicity was observed by T115 against normal human skin
fibroblasts cell lines, and acute toxicity studies in normal
nontumor-bearing mice indicated that T115 is well-tolerated
in vivo (maximum total tolerated dose, 400 mg/kg). In a
mouse xenograft model using human colorectal (HT-29) and
prostate (PC3) cancer cells, T115 significantly inhibited tumor
growth when administered i.p. Taken together, our results
suggest that T115 is a potential drug candidate for cancer
chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1910–5]

Introduction
Microtubules, as major components of the cytoskeleton, are
indispensable for the formation and disappearance of the mitotic
spindle that, in turn, is responsible for separation of duplicated
chromosomes during cell division (1). The basic structural unit of
microtubules is the heterodimer composed of alternating a tubulin
and h tubulin subunits (2). The formation of microtubules is a

dynamic process that involves the polymerization and depolymerization of a and h tubulin heterodimers (2, 3). Disruption of
microtubule formation, either by inhibiting polymerization or by
preventing depolymerization of tubulin, results in cell-cycle arrest
and cell death (4–7). Therefore, the microtubule system of
eukaryotic cells is widely regarded as an attractive target for the
development of anticancer therapeutic agents.
Tubulin-binding compounds that suppress the microtubule
dynamics and disrupt the formation of mitotic spindles have been
used in the treatment of many cancers (8, 9). Prominent examples
include the taxanes such as Taxol and Taxotere, and the Vinca
alkaloids such as vincristine, vinorelbine, and vinblastine. Despite
their broad utility as anticancer agents, these antimitotic drugs
used in the clinic encounter issues related to their neural and
systemic toxicity, marginal water solubility, poor bioavailability,
complex synthetic pathways, and difficult isolation procedures (10–
14). Moreover, development of intrinsic and extrinsic resistance to
these agents further limits their clinical utility (13–15). The typical
mode of administration of these compounds is i.v., thereby adding
discomfort and inconvenience for the patient and caregiver.
Therefore, an urgent need exists for potent antimitotic agents that
combine fewer side effects, reduced drug resistance, oral activity,
and ease of synthesis.
Using computational approaches based on structure based
drug design, we previously identified a defined series of triazolebased compounds designated as T111-T115 that showed robust
tubulin antipolymerization activity and exceptional cytotoxicity
(16). Chemical synthesis of these compounds was accomplished
via an efficient four-step procedure (16). The encouraging results
from these initial studies have motivated us to further characterize the mechanism of action and antitumor activity of our lead
compound T115.
Herein, we show that T115 exhibits potent cytotoxicity in the low
nanomolar range against a wide array of cancer cell lines, including
multidrug-resistant cell lines, yet lacks cytotoxicity against normal
skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, results from in vivo studies in mice
reveal that T115 is well-tolerated even at very high doses
(maximum total tolerated dose, 400 mg/kg) in healthy nontumor
bearing mice and inhibits tumor growth in colorectal xenografts.

at 37jC, 5% CO2 humidity atmosphere in media.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. Cells were plated with densities from 3,000 to 6,000 cells per well
based on growth characteristics in 96-well tissue culture plates, allowed to
attach overnight, and then exposed to various concentrations of tested
drugs for 72 h. Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)] dissolved in PBS was added
to each well with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, and cells were
incubated at 37jC for 2 to 4 h. After removal of MTT containing medium,
150 AL DMSO were added to dissolve formazan crystals in each well.
Absorbance at 595 nm was determined using a TECAN GENios
multifunction microplate reader (TECAN U.S., Inc.). IC50 values were
calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.03 (Graphpad
Software Inc.). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
three independent times. Average values were reported here.
Flow cytometry. The effect of T115 on the cell cycle of proliferating
cells was studied by monitoring the DNA content in HeLa cells in the
presence or absence of T115 at specified concentrations. The cells were
treated at the indicated concentrations of T115 for 24 h, trypsinized, washed
with PBS twice, and fixed by adding cold 70% ethanol dropwise on ice for
30 min. Approximately 1  106 cells were treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNaseA
and 5 Ag/mL propidium iodide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
Fluorescence intensity data were collected and analyzed by quantitative
flow cytometry system Cytomics FC 500 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).

Immunofluorescence staining. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in
a 12-well tissue culture plate until f60% confluent, and then were treated
at different concentrations for 24 h. After fixing with ice-cold methanol at
20jC, coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and stained
with a-tubulin antibody (clone DM1A; Sigma) or FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (Sigma). Coverslips were then mounted using the
ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and stored at 20jC.
Tubulin competitive binding assay. Tubulin (>99% pure; Cytoskeleton,
Inc.; 0.2 mg/mL) was incubated with tritiated tubulin binders (0.1 Amol/L
[3H]colchicine, 0.2 Amol/L [3H]vinblastine, or 0.05 Amol/L [3H]paclitaxel)
and test compounds at various concentrations in 100 AL G-PEM buffer
[80 mmol/L PIPES (pH 6.8), 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, 2.0 mmol/L MgCl2,
1.0 mmol/L GTP plus 5% glycerol] at 37jC for 1 h. The binding mixture was
filtered with GF/C glass microfiber filter (Whatman) and washed twice
before scintillation counting was performed on a Packard TRI-CARB
2300TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin-Elmer).
Tubulin polymerization assay. Tubulin polymerization assays were
conducted using the CytoDYNAMIX Screen 03 (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) assay
system following the manufacturer’s instructions. Tubulin (>99% pure) was
reconstituted to 3 mg/mL using G-PEM buffer. One hundred microliters of
the reconstituted tubulin were added to each well of a prewarmed 96-well
plate and exposed to test compounds at varying concentrations
(0.1–10 Amol/L). The absorbance at 340 nm was recorded every 60 s for
1 h using a TECAN GENios multifunction microplate reader (TECAN U.S.,

mice. After 10 d (day 0) when tumors reached a mean volume of 300 to
400 mm3, mice were randomized into 2 groups (6 mice each group) and
treatment was started. T115 was administered by i.p. injection at 90 or
60 mg/kg on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Maximum tolerable dose in a single
injection is represented by 90 mg/kg, which was established before the
efficacy experiments. No weight loss or other signs of distress such as
hunched posture were observed at either dose. As a vehicle control, DMSO
was injected at 2 mL/kg concentration. Measurements of mice weight and
tumor volumes were recorded every other day with digital caliper.

Results
T115 (Fig. 1A) is the lead compound from a family of novel
tubulin polymerization inhibitors that were rationally designed and
synthesized in our laboratory. These compounds, which possess a
triazole core structure, were easily prepared using a four-step
procedure as described previously (16). The results presented here
support our conclusion that T115 is a highly potent and worthy of
further development as a viable drug candidate for anticancer
therapy.
T115 binds to colchicine binding site. Clinically used
compounds targeting microtubule system have been classified into
three major categories based on notable ligands that target specific
binding sites: taxane, Vinca alkaloid, and colchicine (9). T115
(in concentrations ranging from 0.01–100 Amol/L) inhibited
[3H]colchicine binding, but not [3H]vinblastine or [3H]paclitaxel,
to >99% pure tubulin protein (Fig. 1B–D). The ability of T115 to
compete effectively and specifically with [3H]colchicine suggests
that T115 binds to the colchicine binding site located in the tubulin
h-subunit (17) but not to the Vinca alkaloid or paclitaxel sites.
T115 inhibits microtubule polymerization. To investigate the
effect of T115 on microtubule polymerization, bovine brain tubulin
(>99% pure) was treated with T115 or CA-4 at the indicated
concentrations (0.1–10 Amol/L) for 60 minutes at 37jC (Fig. 2). The
content of polymerized microtubules was monitored by measuring
absorbance at 340 nm every minute for an hour. At all
concentrations tested, T115 exhibited inhibition of microtubule
formation comparable with the known microtubule polymerization

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

inhibitors CA-4 and colchicine, suggesting that T115 possesses
strong antitubulin polymerization activity.
T115 arrests HeLa cells in G2-M phase and disrupts
microtubule apparatus inside these cells. To examine the
effect of T115 on the cell cycle, HeLa cells were exposed to 10,
20, and 40 nmol/L T115 for 24 h. The distributions of treated
cells at different phases of cell cycle (G1, S, G2-M) were analyzed
using flow cytometry by propidium iodide staining of DNA. As
shown in Fig. 3, cells treated with T115 arrest in G2-M phase:
78% cells accumulated in G2-M phase at 40 nmol/L concentration compared with only 13% in vehicle treated control. These
results suggest that T115 arrests cell cycling at the G2-M phase
in a dose-dependent manner.

0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) or T115 at indicated concentrations for 24 h,
trypsinized, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide. The plot shows Cell
distribution (X axis, arbitrary unit) versus DNA content (Y axis, arbitrary unit).

Novel Tubulin Polymerization Inhibitor

Figure 4. Effect of T115 on microtubule network organization. HeLa (A) or MCF7 (B ) cells were grown in DMEM containing either 0.1% DMSO, CA-4, or T115 at
indicated concentrations for 24 h, stained for a-tubulin using FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (green ), and visualized by fluorescent microscopy with a
40 oil immersion lens. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue ). Images are
representative of two independent experiments.

We further investigated the effect of T115 on microtubule
reorganization inside the cells by immunostaining. HeLa and MCF7 cells were exposed to medium containing either 25, 50, or
100 nmol/L of T115 for 24 h after which microtubules were
visualized with FITC conjugated antibody (green) and cell nuclei
stained using 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). As shown
in Fig. 4A (HeLa) and 4b (MCF-7), vehicle-treated controls contain
microtubule networks that are clearly well-organized; however,
when the cells were treated with 25 nmol/L T115, multinucleated
cells were observed. Microtubule distribution was disordered
and long microtubule fibers were rarely seen after treatment with
z50 nmol/L T115. Microtubules exhibited less staining when the
treatment of T115 was increased to 100 nmol/L. Taken together,
these results suggest that treatment with T115 disrupts the
microtubule assembly inside the cells that is essential for formation
of the mitotic spindle and segregation of condensed chromosomes.
T115 inhibits viability of cancer cells from various tissues of
origin. Next, we examined the effect of T115 on the viability of
cancer cells using MTT assays as described in Materials and
Methods. As shown in Table 1, additional evaluation indicated that
T115 exhibits uniformly potent cytotoxicity against a broad
spectrum of carcinoma cells (Table 1) including ovarian, prostate,
and leukemia-derived cell lines. In contrast, T115 was noncytotoxic

www.aacrjournals.org

to normal human cell line GM05659 and FBLC at concentrations of
10 Amol/L, providing a selectivity index of 500- to 1,000-fold when
compared with GI50 values for cancer cell lines. These data suggest
that T115 exhibits both potent and selective cytotoxicity against
cancer cells.
T115 is active against multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines.
The cytotoxicity of T115 was also evaluated against six drugresistant carcinoma cell lines (Table 1). T115 consistently yielded
low-nanomolar IC50 values in all tested drug-resistant cells
independent of phenotypes (P-gp/MDR or MRP or ABC G2). In
addition, T115 inhibited the growth of both endogenous MDR1
overexpressing cells (MCF-7-Adr) and MDR1-transfected cells (BC19). Both paclitaxel and colchicine are ineffective against many of
these drug-resistant cell lines. Thus, the present results indicate
that T115 is not a substrate for the P-gp/MDR, MRP1, or ABCG2
pumps.
T115 inhibits tumor growth in colorectal and prostate
xenografts in vivo. We next examined the effect of T115 on
colorectal and prostate tumor growth in mice. HT-29 (1  106),
colorectal cancer cells and PC3, prostate cancer cells were
inoculated in each flank of NCR nu /nu mice. The treatment
was started when tumor reached a mean volume of 300 to
400 mm3. T115 was administered by i.p. injection at 90 or 60 mg/kg
on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. As a vehicle control, DMSO was injected at
2 mL/kg concentration.
As shown in Fig. 5A and B, therapeutic treatment with T115
at doses of 60 or 90 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth
(P = 0.02) after the first dose. After 5 doses of T115, the tumor
growth continued to remain significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited for
at least 10 d, after which the study was terminated due to excessive
tumor load in vehicle treated group. No clinical signs of distress,
such as weight loss or hunched posture, were associated with T115
treatment at this dose. These results thus show that T115 inhibits
the growth of tumors in vivo.

Discussion
The microtubule system is a well-validated target for the
development of anticancer drugs. Controlled regulation of
microtubule assembly and disassembly is critical for normal cell
division, and thus cancer growth.
The general mode of action of these microtubule binding
molecules is to arrest cell cycle progression by interrupting mitotic
spindle formation and chromosome segregation (18). However,
most if not all clinically available microtubule binding compounds
encounter problems associated with chemical instability, poor
bioavailability, and peripheral neurotoxicity (10–14, 19). In
addition, many clinically used microtubule drugs induce several
drug resistance phenotypes (15, 20, 21). We have developed a novel
family of 1,2,4-triazole–based compounds that may overcome
many of these difficulties.
In this report, we describe the characterization of one of our lead
compounds, T115, from this triazole-based series. T115 is a
structural analogue of CA-4 (Fig. 1); however, the double bond in
the cis-stilbene core structure of several CA-4 analogues is known
to racemize to a trans conformation, which abolishes tubulin
antipolymerization activity and cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines
(10, 11, 19). In contrast, the 1,2,4-triazole core structure in T115 and
its analogues were specifically designed to stabilize the biologically
active cis conformation that might account for their excellent
cytotoxicity (Table 1).

T115 was shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization by targeting
the colchicine binding pocket in h tubulin. T115 exhibited a dosedependent inhibitory effect on the polymerization of tubulin
heterodimers, suggesting that T115 is a potent microtubule
polymerization inhibitor. Using cell-based immunofluorescence
staining assays against a-tubulin, we observed that T115 causes
disorder and fragmentation of the microtubule network and disrupts
mitotic spindle formation. At low concentrations (25–50 nmol/L),
T115 inhibited chromosome separation during mitosis that results
in the formation of multinucleated cells. When HeLa and MCF-7
cells were treated with T115 at increased concentration (100 nmol/L),
significant loss of FITC fluorescence was observed reflecting severe
destruction of the microtubule system.

Tubulin-binding agents are capable of interfering with the
progression of cell cycle at the early mitotic (M2) phase (22, 23).
After exposure to 20 nmol/L T115 for 24 hours, f70% of the HeLa
cells were observed to have doubled in DNA content. This finding
suggests that the chromosomes failed to segregate after replication,
stalling the cell cycle at the metaphase checkpoint and allowing
mitotic arrest.
An intriguing feature of our study is that T115 exhibits potent
antiproliferative activities against multidrug-resistant cell lines.
Exposure to T115 decreased the viability of both endogenous and
transfected P-gP overexpressing cells, specifically MCF-7-Adr
(breast), BC-19 (breast), A2780-DX (ovary), KB-V1 (cervix), and
P388-VMDRC (murine leukemia) in vitro. Moreover, T115 showed

and Methods. The tumor volumes were recorded every other day using digital caliper. Each point represents mean tumor volume for the six animals in each group.

consistently high cytotoxicity across the National Cancer InstituteDevelopmental Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP) panel of 60 cell
lines. T115 maintained high cytotoxicity among MDR phenotypes
in the NCI-DTP panel, including the in vitro drug selected NCI/ADR
cell line (breast), and the naturally MDR cancer cell lines HCT-15
(colon), UO-31 (renal), and TK10 (renal; refs. 16, 24). Taken together,
these data suggest that T115 possesses broad-spectrum cytotoxicity activity and is not a substrate for either P-gp/MDR, MRP, or
ABCG2 (BCRP) in contrast to many clinically used chemotherapeutic drugs.
The robust antimitotic and antiproliferative effects of T115
confirm its potential as a candidate for cancer therapy. Due to the
uniformly strong lethality by T115 against colorectal cells in the
NCI-DTP panel (16), a colorectal cancer xenograft model was
chosen to evaluate the antitumor activity of T115 in vivo. The
in vivo study on human colorectal xenograft tumors in mice
revealed that T115 inhibited tumor growth in a statistically
significant manner at a dose of 90 mg/kg compared with vehicletreated mice. Furthermore, at these treatment doses T115 exhibited
negligible visible side effects such as weight loss, hunch posture,
etc., that are commonly seen with other chemotherapeutic agents.
To further expand our characterization of T115, we investigated its
effect on prostate cancer xenografts. Encouragingly, we found that
T115 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer tumors even at a
lower dose of 60 mg/kg.
T115 represents a novel molecular structure with potent and
selective inhibitory effect against several cancer cells and,
importantly, their drug resistance variants. From a structural

standpoint, T115 eliminates the instability of stilbene-like CA-4
analogues by incorporating the 1,2,4-triazole core as a bridge to
retain the biologically active cis configuration. This compound is
synthetically accessible via a simple four-step mechanism (16). The
hydrochloride salt of T115 was found to be soluble in water up to
2 mg/mL in our studies. Furthermore, the T115 base is soluble in
0.1% DMSO and 99.9% water at concentrations as high as
100 Amol/L. Furthermore, T115 exhibited significant reduction of
tumor load and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion,
the results presented here encourage further preclinical development of T115 as a potential drug candidate for chemotherapy.
