Abstract
Acquired drug resistance is a major obstacle in cancer
therapy. As for many other drugs, this is also the case for
gemcitabine, a nucleoside analogue with activity against non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we evaluate the ability
of bexarotene to modulate the acquisition and maintenance
of gemcitabine resistance in Calu3 NSCLC models. In the
prevention model, Calu3 cells treated repeatedly with gemcitabine alone gradually developed resistance. However, with
inclusion of bexarotene, the cells remained chemosensitive.
RNA analysis showed a strong increase of rrm1 (ribonucleotide reductase M1) expression in the resistant cells (Calu3GemR), a gene known to be involved in gemcitabine
resistance. In addition, the expression of genes surrounding
the chromosomal location of rrm1 was increased, suggesting
that resistance was due to gene amplification at the chr11
p15.5 locus. Analysis of genomic DNA confirmed that the rrm1
gene copy number was increased over 10-fold. Correspondingly, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of metaphase
chromosomes showed an intrachromosomal amplification
of the rrm1 locus. In the therapeutic model, bexarotene
gradually resensitized Calu3-GemR cells to gemcitabine,
reaching parental drug sensitivity after 10 treatment cycles.
This was associated with a loss in rrm1 amplification.
Corresponding with the in vitro data, xenograft tumors
generated from the resistant cells did not respond to
gemcitabine but were growth inhibited when bexarotene was
added to the cytotoxic agent. The data indicate that
bexarotene can resensitize gemcitabine-resistant tumor cells
by reversing gene amplification. This suggests that bexarotene
may have clinical utility in cancers where drug resistance by
gene amplification is a major obstacle to successful therapy.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men
and women (1). The American Cancer Society estimated for 2004
f173,770 new cases of lung cancer in the United States, and
f160,440 people dying of this disease. Non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for

almost 80% of all cases. Chemotherapy remains the only treatment
option for patients with unresectable NSCLC. However, the current
5-year survival rate has not improved with this therapy (2). Thus,
identification of effective treatment regimens for late-stage disease
is urgently needed.
Gemcitabine (2¶,2¶-difluorodeoxycytidine) is a nucleoside analogue and has shown antitumor activity in various cancers,
including lung cancer (3–6). The activity of gemcitabine is based
primarily on the formation of gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP),
which incorporates into the DNA and acts as a DNA synthesis
chain terminator (7). In addition, the diphosphate metabolite of
gemcitabine (dFdCDP) was also reported to inhibit ribonucleotide
reductase causing a decrease in dCTP, decreased feedback
inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase, and enhanced phosphorylation
of gemcitabine (8–10). Recent studies have suggested that
ribonucleotide reductase large subunit 1 (RRM1) and deoxycytidine
kinase play important roles in resistance to gemcitabine (11, 12).
Developing new treatment strategies to prevent and overcome
gemcitabine resistance will greatly improve the clinical utility of
this compound.
We previously showed that the selective retinoid X receptor
agonist bexarotene (LGD1069, Targretin) is an efficacious chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent in a number of preclinical
rodent models of breast cancer (13–16). We further showed that
the combination of bexarotene and cytotoxic agents produces
synergistic growth inhibition as well as prevents and overcomes
acquired drug resistance in several preclinical cancer models
(17–21). The encouraging preclinical results with bexarotene, alone
or in combination with various cytotoxic agents, led us to further
examine its role in treatment of solid tumors. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the influence of bexarotene on the
acquisition and maintenance of gemcitabine resistance in human
NSCLC. Our results show that inclusion of bexarotene into the
gemcitabine treatment regimen prevented and overcame acquired
gemcitabine resistance in NSCLC Calu3 cells. This activity was
associated with prevention or reversal of rrm1 gene amplification.
Moreover, xenograft tumors generated from the gemcitabineresistant Calu3-GemR cells were unresponsive to gemcitabine or
bexarotene as single agents but showed a statistically significant
decrease in growth when treated with the bexarotene/gemcitabine
combination.

or DMSO, respectively, were at concentrations that limited the final
concentration of the solvent in the culture medium to <0.1%.
Cell lines. The human NSCLC cell line Calu3 was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. A gemcitabine-resistant derivative of
Calu3 cells (Calu3-GemR) was generated as described in Results. All cells
were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 2 mmol/L glutamine in 95% air, 5% CO2.
In vitro treatment regimens. To determine the effect of bexarotene
and/or gemcitabine on the development of gemcitabine resistance, Calu3
cells were seeded at 2  106 in T-225 flasks. The treatment schemes are
illustrated in Fig. 1A. Briefly, the cells were exposed to the regimens on a 10day cycle. After a 3-day treatment with gemcitabine alone or in combination
with bexarotene the cells were washed, counted, and replated followed by
either a 7-day exposure to bexarotene or to control medium. At the end of
each treatment cycle, the cells were trypsinized, when possible counted, and
then replated onto a new flask and again exposed to the same treatment
regimen. This procedure was repeated 10 times. For the gemcitabine singleagent regimen (Fig. 1A, regimen 1), the cells were exposed to 50 nmol/L
gemcitabine for 3 days followed by 7 days in control medium. For the
combination of intermittent gemcitabine with continuous bexarotene (Fig.
1A, regimen 3), the cells were exposed to 50 nmol/L gemcitabine and 1
Amol/L bexarotene for 3 days followed by 1 Amol/L bexarotene for 7 days.
Control cells were treated similarly with fresh medium containing 0.1%
solvent or 1 Amol/L bexarotene given continuously (Fig. 1A, regimen 2). Cell
numbers were monitored by trypan blue exclusion.
In vitro drug sensitivity assay. To determine the sensitivity of parental
Calu3 cells and their gemcitabine-resistant variants to gemcitabine, ara-C,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates
and treated with each agent at various concentrations for 3 days. Drug
effect was measured by WST-1 assay (Roche). Briefly, 10 AL of WST-1
reagent were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37jC; the
absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments)
at a wavelength of 420 nm.
RNA isolation and cDNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated from
2  106 to 5  106 cells using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and
stored at 80jC. Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA in
a 50 AL reaction volume containing 1 reverse transcription buffer, 5.5
mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 Amol/L
random hexamers, 0.4 unit of RNase inhibitor, and 1.25 units of MuLV
reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Human reference cDNA,
prepared from commercial RNA pooled from various tissues (Clontech),
was used as a standard. All cDNAs were stored at 80jC.
DNA isolation and purification. Total DNA was isolated from 1  106
to 5  106 cells using PureLink genomic DNA purification kits (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was eluted
with Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and stored at 20jC until use.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Real-time PCR assays were done using
specific primers and a specific dual-labeled (5¶-6FAM/3¶-TAMRA) probes for
each target. For gene expression analyses, cDNAs corresponding to 10 ng
total RNA were analyzed, for relative DNA copy number determinations
10 ng of genomic DNA were used per assay. Reaction volumes were 50 AL
containing 1 Universal Taqman buffer (Applied Biosystems), 300 nmol/L
of each forward and reverse primer and 100 nmol/L probe. Reactions were
carried out in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems) for 40 cycles of 15 s at 95jC and 60 s at 60jC. RNA expression
of the target genes was normalized to the expression level of the
housekeeping genes 36b4 or gapdh. DNA copy numbers were normalized
by gapdh DNA signal to account for input variation. The following primers
and probes were used for RNA analyses: 36b4 (M17885) forward 5¶GCAGATCCGCATGTCCCTT-3¶, reverse 5¶-TGTTTTCCAGGTGCCCTCG-3¶,

Integrated DNA Technologies. All other probes were purchased from
Applied Biosystems.
Oligonucleotide array hybridization and data analysis. Sample
processing and hybridization was done as described in the Affymetrix
GeneChip Expression Analysis Manual (Affymetrix). Briefly, double-stranded
cDNA was synthesized from 2 Ag total RNA using the T7-(dT)24 primer
[5¶-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG(T) 24 -3¶].
From the cDNA, biotinylated cRNA was synthesized using the ENZO High
Yield BioArray IVT Kit (Affymetrix). Following chemical fragmentation, 10
Ag of the fragmented cRNA probe were mixed with a hybridization cocktail
containing control oligonucleotide B2 and hybridization controls BioB,
BioC, BioD, and cre (Affymetrix), herring sperm DNA (Fisher Scientific), and
acetylated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen). All samples were hybridized
to human HG-U133A GeneChip Arrays for 16 h at 45jC with rotation (60
rpm). After washing and staining (using R-phycoerythrin streptavidin with
amplification by biotinylated antistreptavidin antibody) on the Affymetrix
Microfluidics Workstation according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Microfluidics Protocol EukGE-WS2v4), the arrays were scanned on an
Agilent scanner at a wavelength of 570 nm. Expression intensity signals for
each probe set on each of the microarrays were generated with the
Affymetrix MAS5.0 software using the software’s global scaling procedure to
normalize between arrays. From each of the different Calu3 cultures
(parental, gemcitabine-resistant treated with vehicle, bexarotene, gemcitabine, or with the gemcitabine/bexarotene combination for 10 cycles), four
replicate RNA samples were prepared and individually subjected to
microarray analysis. The expression signals were averaged and transformed
into log 2 ratios. Genes not called consistently ‘‘present’’ by the MAS5.0
software in all replicates of at least one of the five conditions were excluded
from further analysis. The complete microarray data set has been deposited
in National Center for Biotechnology Informations Gene Expression
Omnibus1 and is accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus Series
accession number GSE6914.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosomes.
Confluent cultures of parental, resistant, or resensitized Calu3 cells were split
(1:5) and 24 h after passage these semisynchronized cultures were treated for
2 h with 0.1 Ag/mL colcemid for metaphase arrest. Cells were harvested,
treated with a hypotonic solution of 0.075 mol/L KCl and fixed in methanol/
acetic acid (3:1). The suspensions were dropped onto microscope slides and
metaphase spreads were stored overnight at room temperature. Afterward,
slides were either processed immediately for hybridization or stored at
20jC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was done using a
probe for rrm1 that was generated from the bacterial artificial chromosome
clone CTD-2253D11 (Invitrogen) and labeled using the FISH Tag DNA Green
Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A chromosome 11
centromeric probe, purchased prelabeled with Direct Red (Qbiogene), was
included as control. Metaphase chromosomes were washed twice with
2 SSC and digested with pepsin (100 Ag/mL in 10 mmol/L HCl) for 5 min at
37jC. After two more washes with 2 SSC, slides were consecutively treated
with PBS/50 mmol/L MgCl2 (5 min), PBS/50 mmol/L MgCl2/1% formaldehyde (10 min), and PBS/50 mmol/L MgCl2 (5 min), followed by ethanol
dehydration and air drying. Before hybridization, both probes were combined
in Hybrisol VII hybridization buffer (Qbiogene), denatured (96jC for 5 min),
and immediately placed on ice. The hybridization mixture was added onto
the slides, sealed under a coverslip, and the slides were incubated at 75jC for
5 min. Hybridization was done for 18 h at 37jC followed by washes in 2 SSC/
0.1% NP40 (5 min at 37jC) and 0.4 SSC/0.3% NP40 (2 min at 73jC). Because

chromosomes were visible due to signal background in the green channel,
counterstaining was not necessary. Slides were evaluated using a Leitz DMRB
fluorescence microscope using filters for FITC (rrm1) and Texas red
(chromosome 11).
In vivo animal studies. For the human xenograft tumor model, parental
or gemcitabine-resistant Calu3 cells were harvested in log-phase growth
and resuspended in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of culture medium and Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). Tumor cells were implanted s.c. into the right and left axial
regions of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan) with a 25-gauge
needle containing 0.5  106 cells in 100 AL. Animals were randomized and
treatment began when tumors were palpable (4–5 days after tumor
injection). Each group consisted of 10 animals bearing two tumors per
animal. Bexarotene was suspended in an aqueous solution containing 10%
(v/v) polyethylene glycol (M r 400) / Tween 80 (99.5:0.5) and 90% of 1% (w/v)
carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma Chemical Co.) and dosed p.o. once daily at
100 mg/kg. This dose of bexarotene was previously determined as the
maximum tolerated dose, the dose that caused <10% weight loss over the
course of the study (15, 22). Gemcitabine was prepared fresh each time in
sterile saline and was administered at 100 mg/kg i.p. weekly. Animals
receiving no drugs were given vehicle for bexarotene p.o. daily and saline
i.p. weekly. Animals receiving bexarotene only were given saline i.p. weekly.
Animals receiving gemcitabine only were given vehicle for bexarotene p.o.
daily. The treatment continued for 6 weeks. Tumor growth was measured
with an electronic caliper (Mitutoyo, Inc.) twice weekly. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula V = 1/2AB 2, where A and B represent the
longest and the shortest axis of the tumor, respectively. Animal weights
were recorded once weekly. The animals used in this study were housed in a
U.S. Department of Agriculture–registered facility in accordance with NIH
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.
Data analysis. Dose-response curves for growth inhibition were
generated and were plotted as a percentage of untreated control. Values
for IC50 (the drug concentration needed to produce 50% growth inhibition)
were determined by nonlinear least square regression (JMP). Differences in
mean values between groups were analyzed by unpaired Student’s t test
with two-tailed comparison. Multiple comparisons used the one-way
ANOVA test with post hoc t test comparison. Differences of P < 0.05 are
considered significantly different. Software for statistical analysis was by
SigmaStat (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
In vitro growth inhibition by bexarotene and gemcitabine.
When used as a single agent, gemcitabine produced a sigmoidal
concentration-dependent growth inhibition of Calu3 cells (data not
shown). The concentration needed to inhibit 50% of cell growth,
IC50, was f3 nmol/L. On the other hand, bexarotene showed
limited growth inhibitory activity up to 10 Amol/L. Bexarotene did
not interfere with or enhance gemcitabine activity in the
combination with gemcitabine after single exposure or multiple
exposures (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, after repeated treatment for five
cycles, gemcitabine activity was neither enhanced nor inhibited by
the combination with bexarotene when compared with cells
treated with gemcitabine alone (Fig. 1B). Cells treated with
continuous bexarotene grew similarly as vehicle-treated controls
(Fig. 1B) and continued to do so until the end of the 10-cycle
regimen (data not shown). However, when the gemcitabine singleagent regimen (Fig. 1A, regimen 1) was continued beyond five
cycles, the cells lost sensitivity to the agent and the cultures regrew
within 100 days (Fig. 1C). In contrast, when gemcitabine was
combined with bexarotene (Fig. 1A, regimen 3), the cultures stayed
sensitive and only recovered after treatment was stopped (Fig. 1C).
Characterization of gemcitabine-resistant cells. Surviving
cells obtained at the end of treatment from cultures treated with
gemcitabine alone, Calu3-GemR, or from cultures treated with the
combination regimen were evaluated for their sensitivity to

gemcitabine and other cytotoxic agents. The surviving cells isolated
from gemcitabine-treated cultures were highly resistant to
gemcitabine with a resistance factor of >50. They also showed
some cross-resistance to a compound of same class, ara-C, but
were sensitive to other cytotoxic agents with different mechanisms
of action (Table 1A). On the other hand, cells recovered after
treatment with the bexarotene/gemcitabine combination remained
chemosensitive toward all compounds tested, including gemcitabine (Table 1A).
To elucidate the mechanism of gemcitabine resistance in the
Calu3-GemR cells, real-time PCR was used to analyze mRNA levels
for genes known to be involved in gemcitabine resistance: rrm1
(ribonucleotide reductase large subunit 1), rrm2 (ribonucleotide
reductase large subunit 2), dck (deoxycytidine kinase), cda
(cytidine deaminase), and ctps (CTP synthase). Our data showed
that rrm1 mRNA expression was low in Calu3 parental cells, in cells
treated with bexarotene alone or with the combination regimen,
but was increased f20-fold (P < 0.0001) in the gemcitabineresistant cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, there was a small but
significant (P < 0.01) change in the expression of cda (60%
decrease) and ctps (60% increase) in the resistant cells when
compared with the parental cells. The expression of rrm2 and dck
was not significantly different between parental and gemcitabineresistant cells. When the gene expression profiles of gemcitabineresistant and parental Calu3 cells were compared by microarray
analysis, the p15.5 locus on chromosome 11 showed a large number
of genes overexpressed in the resistant cells (Fig. 2B). Included in
the center of the overexpression locus was rrm1 (Table 2). These
data suggested that increased expression of rrm1 and surrounding
genes may be the result of gene amplification. This was confirmed
for rrm1 using a DNA-specific quantitative PCR assay. The copy
number of the rrm1 gene was f12-fold higher (P < 0.0001) in the
resistant cells compared with the parental cells (Fig. 2C). In
general, gene amplification is observed in two forms: intrachromosomal as extended chromosomal regions or extrachromo-

somal in the form of episomes or double minutes (23). To
distinguish between these mechanisms, metaphase chromosomes
of parental and resistant cells were analyzed by FISH (Fig. 2D).
Single copies of rrm1 on chromosome 11 (identified by a
chromosome-specific centromeric probe) in parental cells could
not be detected by FISH, apparently due to insufficient sensitivity
of the probe (Fig. 2D, top). However, in the resistant cells, a very
strong rrm1 signal was observed on one of the number 11
chromosomes (Fig. 2D, bottom). These data indicate that the rrm1
gene is amplified intrachromosomally as extended chromosomal
region within one of the number 11 chromosomes. No signal
indicative of extrachromosomal elements was observed. Taken
together, these results showed that intrachromosomal amplification of the rrm1 gene and its concomitant overexpression was most
likely responsible for the phenotype in gemcitabine-resistant Calu3GemR cells.
Effects of bexarotene on gemcitabine-resistant cells. Because
addition of bexarotene to the gemcitabine regimen successfully
prevented the development of resistance, we investigated whether
bexarotene can also overcome preexisting gemcitabine resistance.
Calu3-GemR cells were repeatedly treated either with vehicle, with
bexarotene or gemcitabine as single agents, or with a combination
of both agents in the same regimens used in the prevention study
(Fig. 1A). After four treatment cycles, the cultures treated with
the combination regimen showed a loss in cell numbers, which
continued until the end of the 10th cycle (Fig. 3A). This indicated a
resensitization of the Calu3-GemR cells to the cytotoxic activity of
gemcitabine. The cultures treated with the single drug regimens
expanded as the vehicle controls. However, analysis of RNA and
DNA samples collected over the treatment course revealed that,
whereas with vehicle and gemcitabine treatment rrm1 gene
amplification and expression was still increasing over time, in the
cultures treated with bexarotene alone they were gradually
reduced, reaching parental levels at the end of the study (Fig. 3B
and C). As expected from these data, the Calu3-GemR cells, after

microarrays. Signals are plotted as ratios between resistant and parental cells in order of their chromosomal arrangement. Only genes that were detected above

treatment with bexarotene alone for 10 cycles, were again sensitive
to gemcitabine (Table 1B). In addition, FISH analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of the resensitized cells resembled those of the
parental cells (data not shown), indicating a complete loss of the
rrm1 gene amplification. Comparison of the microarray gene
expression profiles of the resensitized cells and the resistant Calu3GemR cells showed that not only rrm1 but the entire chr11p15.5
amplicon was repressed by exposure to bexarotene (Table 2). In
addition, most of the genes outside of this locus, whose expression
was altered concomitantly with the acquisition of gemcitabine
resistance, were reverted as well (Supplementary Fig. S1 and
Table S1). In summary, bexarotene over the course of 10 treatment
cycles reversed the phenotype of the gemcitabine-resistant cells
almost completely to that of the parental cells, with regard to drug
sensitivity, intrachromosomal rrm1 amplification, as well as their
molecular profiles.

Effect of bexarotene/gemcitabine combination in vivo. To
evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the bexarotene/gemcitabine
combination in vivo, Calu3 cells were established as xenograft
tumors in athymic nude mice. As seen in Fig. 4A, parental Calu3
tumors grew continuously throughout the course of study in both
vehicle-treated control and drug-treated animals. When compared
with vehicle control, bexarotene given alone at 100 mg/kg daily had
no significant effect on tumor growth after the 4-week treatment
period. In contrast, gemcitabine at 100 mg/kg once weekly
decreased tumor volume by 63% (P < 0.05 versus control). More
importantly, the combination of both agents decreased tumor
volumes by 80% relative to gemcitabine alone (P < 0.05) and by 93%
relative to vehicle control (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A). To determine whether
the combination regimen can overcome gemcitabine resistance
in vivo, animals were implanted with the gemcitabine-resistant
Calu3 cells (Calu3-GemR) and were treated with single agents or

NOTE: Genes are ordered by position of their transcriptional start site corresponding to Fig. 2B (gray). Expression was measured using Affymetrix
U133A Genechips ( four replicates per condition) and all genes listed showed expression clearly above background. Expression ratios were calculated
from the average signals of gemcitabine-resistant Calu3 cells (GemR) and parental Calu3 cells, as well as of gemcitabine-resistant Calu3 cells treated
with bexarotene (GemR + Bex) or vehicle (GemR + Veh).

with the combination. Gemcitabine-resistant tumor growth in
animals treated with single agents was similar to that of vehicle
controls, whereas the combination regimen produced a 38%
decrease in tumor growth compared with gemcitabine-treated
animals (Fig. 4B; P < 0.05 versus gemcitabine alone). The benefit of
the bexarotene/gemcitabine combination became apparent beyond
30 days as the tumor volume in mice receiving the combination
therapy began to diverge from the tumor volume in mice treated
with gemcitabine alone. Collectively, these results showed that the
bexarotene/gemcitabine combination produced a greater antitumor effect than the single agents in the Calu3 xenograft model.
Furthermore, the data showed that, as in vitro, inclusion of
bexarotene into the treatment regimen could overcome gemcitabine resistance in vivo.

Discussion
Acquired drug resistance is one of the major obstacles to
successful cancer therapy. Whatever the class of the cytotoxic
agent and its mechanism of action, most solid tumors eventually
become resistant to treatment. Therefore, the inclusion of agents
that can interfere with the development of acquired resistance to
cytotoxic drugs may provide a substantial clinical benefit. In this
study, we show that bexarotene can prevent and reverse resistance
to gemcitabine in the Calu3 NSCLC model. Parental Calu3 cells that
were treated with repetitive cycles of gemcitabine acquired
resistance to the cytotoxic agent within f8 weeks of treatment.
This was completely prevented when bexarotene was included in
the treatment regimen. Parental Calu3 cells and cells recovered
after treatment with the combination regimen were f50-fold more
sensitive to gemcitabine than the Calu3-GemR–resistant cells. This
resistance was accompanied by a strong increase in rrm1

expression, one of the two polypeptides that assemble to form
the tetrameric RNase reductase enzyme. Other genes that play roles
in the activity and metabolism of gemcitabine and have been
associated with development of resistance were either unaffected
(rrm2, dck) or the effects were too small (cda, ctps) to contribute
substantially to the strong increase in resistance [resistant factor
(RF), 55]. Therefore, the majority of the resistance can probably be
attributed to the strong amplification and overexpression of rrm1.
RNase reductase is the key enzyme for the synthesis of
deoxyribonucleotides, including dCTP, and has been implicated
in gemcitabine resistance in various models (11, 12, 24). Overexpression of this enzyme leads to resistance on two levels, directly
through competition of dCTP with the triphosphate of gemcitabine
(dFdCTP) for incorporation into the DNA and indirectly through
inhibition of the conversion of gemcitabine into the active
metabolites. Because RNase reductase itself is also inhibited by
one of these metabolites (dFdCDP), resistance through overexpression of the enzyme is potentiated. This activity also accounts
for the observed cross-resistance (Table 1A) with ara-C.
Increased expression of rrm1 coincided with a strong increase in
rrm1 gene copy number. The rrm1 gene is located in the
chr11p15.5 locus. Microarray analysis showed that, in addition to
rrm1, the expression of many genes in close vicinity of this gene
was increased in the resistant cells (Fig. 2B; Table 2). Although we
have not directly determined whether, as for rrm1, this is also due
to increased DNA copy number, the high concentration of
overexpressed genes together with the measured increase in
rrm1 DNA locus suggests a general amplification of this region.
This is also in agreement with amplification of the mouse 7E1
locus, as measured by comparative genomic hybridization and
observed with gemcitabine resistance in a mouse colon tumor
model (25). The mouse 7E1 region corresponds to the human

chr11p15.5 locus and also contains rrm1 as well as several other
homologues contained in the human chr11p15.5 locus. Other than
rrm1 itself, chr11p15.5 genes with the highest induction of
expression in Calu3-GemR–resistant cells are several hemoglobins
as well as members of the TRIM (tripartite motif) cluster. Based on
current knowledge, there is no functional association of these
genes with drug resistance, chromosomal instability, growth, or
other activities that favor them for selection. Thus, their overexpression is likely due to bystander coamplification with the rrm1
locus. In addition to the genes at the chr11p15.5 locus, microarray
analysis showed that several hundred other genes throughout the
genome are also significantly higher or lower expressed in the
resistant cells when compared with the parental cells (Supplementary Table S1). Some of these genes are involved in DNA replication
and repair and one might be tempted to speculate whether these
genes might causatively be involved in the development of
resistance (or its reversal; see below). However, at this point, it is
difficult to distinguish between cause and effect. The observed
expression changes for most of these genes are most likely a
consequence of the resistance and adaptation to the molecular
changes caused by amplification of a large gene set. Further studies

are necessary to identify the genes that are the active players and
possible mediators of the activity of bexarotene in preventing
development of drug resistance.
Treatment of the Calu3-GemR cells with bexarotene resensitizes
them to the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine. This was not only
observed in vitro but also in vivo. Xenograft tumors generated from
gemcitabine-resistant cells started to respond to the combination
treatment after f30 days of therapy, whereas no effect on tumor
growth was observed with single agent. We have not tested whether
the tumors treated with bexarotene as single agent for an extended
period regained sensitivity to gemcitabine. However, Calu3-GemR
cells treated in vitro with bexarotene alone were as sensitive as
parental cells at the end of the treatment period. This was not
simply due to lack of selective pressure because it did not occur in
cultures treated with vehicle over the same time course. In
addition, even in the presence of selective pressure (i.e., in the
combination treatment), bexarotene caused resensitization, as
indicated by the dramatic cell loss in these cultures. Not
surprisingly, due to selective pressure by the cytotoxic agent, the
small number of cells remaining alive in the cultures treated with
the combination regimen represented the not yet resensitized
fraction, which still contained amplified rrm1 (Fig. 3) and showed
the resistant phenotype (Table 1B). The resensitization by bexarotene was accompanied by a gradual loss of rrm1 gene copy
number and expression over the treatment time course, resulting in
a parental rrm1 genotype and phenotype after 3 months of
treatment. Furthermore, genes that are colocalized with rrm1 on
chr11p15.5 were also normalized.
Gene amplification has been observed either intrachromosomally as extended chromosomal regions or extrachromosomally as
episomes or double minutes. Conceptually, reversal of not only
rrm1 amplification but of the whole locus could be most easily
explained by loss or removal of double minutes containing the
amplified genes. Such a mechanism is independent of the amplified
genes, does not require any sequence-specific recombination
events, and therefore could also account for the broad activities
of bexarotene in drug resistance, including resistance to paclitaxel
in models of breast and lung cancer, which involve the overexpression and its reversal of the mdr1 multidrug resistance gene
(18, 19). Studies have shown that double minutes can be eliminated
from cells through a process that involves increased micronuclei
formation and that this process can be induced by the
differentiating agent hydroxyurea (26–28). However, not all
differentiating agents show such activity and therefore differentiation per se is insufficient for the reversal of amplification. Our
FISH studies, however, indicate that the rrm1 overexpression is
caused by intrachromosomal amplification of the rrm1 locus in
one of the number 11 chromosomes (Fig. 2D). At this point, we do

not know whether this intrachromosomal amplification had been
generated through a multistep mechanism that involves initial
formation of episomes (29), in which case extrachromosomal
amplification may still play a role in the prevention of drug
resistance by bexarotene. However, the reversal of gene amplification in the form of intrachromosomally extended regions would
involve more complex processes and no studies have been
published that specifically address such mechanisms. Conceptually,
the amplified locus or even the whole chromosome carrying the
amplification could be replaced by the normal alleles. This would
resemble mechanisms described for processes leading to loss of
heterozygosity. Studies of RNA-guided sequence-specific DNA
rearrangements in Tetrahymena thermophila have suggested a role
for targeted DNA deletion in genome surveillance (30) and the
observed activity of bexarotene may involve similar processes.
Whatever the mechanism, bexarotene could either induce cellular
changes that selectively favor those cells that reverse the gene
amplification or, alternatively, specifically induce such processes
involved in genome surveillance. The latter would also be in
concordance with previous data from fluctuation analysis showing
that bexarotene can maintain/increase genomic integrity of tumor
cells by interfering with the acquisition of spontaneous mutations
resulting in drug resistance (18, 19).
As mentioned above, bexarotene also reversed the resistanceassociated changes for the vast majority of the genes outside the
chr11p15.5 locus (Supplementary Fig. S1). Some of these may be
directly or indirectly involved in the reversal or prevention of the
DNA amplification. A potential candidate is XRCC4, which is
reduced in the resistant cells and normalized by treatment with
bexarotene (Supplementary Table S1). This gene is involved in
nonhomologous end-joining of DNA, which is an important
process in DNA repair and maintenance of genome integrity. We
have observed similar effects of bexarotene on XRCC4 in other
resistance models.2 Again, currently, we cannot clearly distinguish
between cause and effect. Future time course analyses of the
molecular events in the resensitization process should help to
delineate the primary effects of bexarotene.
In summary, we have shown that bexarotene can prevent and
overcome amplification of rrm1 and associated resistance to
gemcitabine, in vitro and in vivo. It is likely that the mechanism of
action is related for both prevention and reversal of drug
resistance, and future research is directed toward understanding
of the molecular events involved. Hopefully, these findings can
serve as a basis for innovative therapeutic strategies in the
treatment of cancer.
