Abstract
MicroRNAs (miR) are a class of small (f21 nucleotide)
noncoding RNAs that, in general, negatively regulate gene
expression. Some miRs harboring CGIs undergo methylationmediated silencing, a characteristic of many tumor suppressor
genes. To identify such miRs in liver cancer, the miRNA
expression profile was analyzed in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cell lines treated with 5-azacytidine (DNA hypomethylating agent) and/or trichostatin A (histone deacetylase
inhibitor). The results showed that these epigenetic drugs
differentially regulate expression of a few miRs, particularly
miR-1-1, in HCC cells. The CGI spanning exon 1 and intron 1 of
miR-1-1 was methylated in HCC cell lines and in primary
human HCCs but not in matching liver tissues. The miR-1-1
gene was hypomethylated and activated in DNMT1 / HCT
116 cells but not in DNMT3B null cells, indicating a key role
for DNMT1 in its methylation. miR-1 expression was also
markedly reduced in primary human hepatocellular carcinomas compared with matching normal liver tissues. Ectopic
expression of miR-1 in HCC cells inhibited cell growth and
reduced replication potential and clonogenic survival. The
expression of FoxP1 and MET harboring three and two miR-1
cognate sites, respectively, in their respective 3¶-untranslated
regions, was markedly reduced by ectopic miR-1. Up-regulation of several miR-1 targets including FoxP1, MET, and
HDAC4 in primary human HCCs and down-regulation of their
expression in 5-AzaC–treated HCC cells suggest their role in
hepatocarcinogenesis. The inhibition of cell cycle progression
and induction of apoptosis after re-expression of miR-1 are
some of the mechanisms by which DNA hypomethylating
agents suppress hepatocarcinoma cell growth. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent
cancer in the world and is the third leading cause of cancer-related
death with annual death rate exceeding 500,000. The high mortality

is due to late stage detection of this cancer when most of the
therapies available are not effective (1). Primary HCC, the most
common primary malignant tumor arising in the liver accounts for
>90% of all primary liver cancer. In addition, metastatic liver tumor
arises from colon, prostate, or breast carcinomas. The disease is
progressive and death usually occurs within 10 months of initial
diagnosis.
Recent demonstration of differential expression of microRNAs
(miR) and their target mRNAs in cancer, and the function of some
miRs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors has spurred considerable
interest in elucidating their role in tumorigenesis (2, 3). MicroRNAs
are highly conserved, small noncoding RNAs that play critical role
in variety of biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, metabolism, and immunity
( for review, see ref. 4). In general, miRNAs negatively regulate gene
expression in vertebrates by multiple mechanisms such as
complimentary base pairing with 3¶ untranslated region (UTR) of
their target mRNAs that results in translational repression, mRNA
cleavage, and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid
deadenylation (5). Under certain stressed conditions, miRs can
also enhance expression of target mRNAs (5, 6). Primary miRNAs
(pri-miRNA) are processed by RNases to generate the mature
miRNAs that are recruited by RNA-induced silencing complex to
exert their biological functions for review, see ref. 7.
Mammalian DNA is predominantly methylated at C-5-position
of complimentary CpG bp by concerted action of three DNA
methyltransferases namely, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b ( for
review, see ref. 8). This epigenetic modification is essential for
mammalian development and its aberrations lead to a variety of
diseases including cancer (9–11). Recent studies have established
that such as mutation, methylation-mediated silencing of tumor
suppressor genes play a causal role in tumorigenesis. Paradoxically,
genome-wide DNA hypomethylation that induces chromosomal
instability and spurious gene expression is also involved in
carcinogenesis. Unlike mutation, methylation can be reversed by
inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase, resulting in re-expression of
silenced tumor suppressor genes. Approval of drugs, such as Vidaza
(5-Azacytidine) and Dacogen (5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine or decitabine), by the Food and Drug Administration as anticancer agents
underscores the usefulness of epigenetic therapy. Recent studies
showed that differential regulation of some miRs such as miR-127,
miR-124a, and let-7a3 by differential methylation of associated
CGIs occur in human cancers (12–14).
We have studied the efficacy of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
in a rat model of hepatocarcinogenesis and the molecular
mechanisms of action of these drugs in vivo (15–23). This study
showed that i.p. injection of 5-AzaC completely regressed growth
of a transplanted tumor by demethylating and activating the

antioxidant gene encoding metallothioneins (24) and a receptortype tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO with tumor suppressor property
(25, 26). We have also shown that these inhibitors induce
degradation of DNMT1 in cancer cells and facilitate activation of
silent genes (15, 27). To identify candidate tumor suppressor miRs
that are silenced by epigenetic mechanism in human HCCs, we
performed miRNA microarray analysis in HCC cells treated with 5AzaC alone or in combination with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor. Deacetylation of histones promotes tumorigenesis by repressing genes that inhibit cell cycle progression,
differentiation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and inducing expression of
genes involved in angiogenesis, cell migration, and invasion (28).
HDAC inhibitors reverse cellular transformation by altering
expression of the genes involved in these pathways. Inhibitors of
DNMTs and HDACs are very promising anticancer agents, as many
tumor suppressor genes are synergistically activated upon treatment with these two classes of inhibitors (29). The objective of the
present study was to identify miRs activated by these chromatinmodifying agents. Here, we show that miR-1-1 is one such gene that
is methylated in human HCC cells and primary HCC, and its
activation by the epigenetic drugs suppresses tumor cell growth by
down-regulating its oncogenic targets MET, FoxP1, and HDAC4.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, treatment with the drugs. Human HCC cell line (Hep3B,
HepG2, Huh7, SK-HEP-1, and SNU449) were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and SK-HEP-1 cells were
cultured in MEMa medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, and 1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids; SNU-449 cells
were grown in RPMI in a 5% CO2 incubator according to supplier’s (ATCC)
instructions. Exponentially growing cells were treated with 5-AzaC and/or
TSA for different time periods. Cells were harvested for RNA/miRNA
isolation, and whole cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis.
DNMT1+/+ and DNMT1 / , DNMT3B / , and DKO (DNMT1 / and
DNMT3B / ) HCT116 cells were grown as described earlier (30).
Human primary HCC samples and matching controls were obtained
from the cooperative human tissue network.
Plasmid construction. 3¶-UTR of FoxP1 and MET were amplified from
human lymphocyte DNA using Accuprime Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and
cloned into PCR2 cloning vector (Qiagen). Inserts were retrieved with Mlu I
and cloned into the same sites of a luciferase reporter vector, pIS0, obtained
from Addgene (31). Deletion of miR-1 complimentary site from 3¶-UTR of
FOXP1 and MET were performed by PCR. The following primers were used
to amplify 3¶-UTRs: FoxP1-3¶UTR-F, CCCCGAGAATGAAGATTGG and
FoxP1-3¶UTR-R, CAGTGGTAGGATAAA CACAAGGG; FOXP1-Dmir1-1F,
TCTTCCTTCAGACATCACCACG and FOXP1-Dmir1-2R, CGTGGTGATGTCTGAAGGAAGA; MET-3¶UTR-F, CAATGGTTTT TTCACTGCCTGAC and
MET-3¶UTR-R, AGCCAGGTGAAATCCATCTTAGG; MET-Dmir1-#1-F,
AACCTCCACCTCCCAGGC TC and MET-ymir1#2-R, TTGAG CCTGGGAGGTG
GAGGTTGC.
RNA isolation and miRNA microarray analysis. Total RNA was
isolated from HCC cells by Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was labeled and hybridized on miRNA
microarray chips as previously described (32). Briefly, 5 Ag of RNA from each
sample was biotin labeled during reverse transcription using random
hexamers. Hybridization was carried out on version 4 of our miRNA chip
(ArrayExpress accession number AMEXP-258), which contains 381 probes
for mature and precursor human miRNAs and 393 probes for mouse
miRNAs, together with controls. There are four spot replicates for each
probe on the chip. Hybridization signals were detected by biotin binding of
a Streptavidin-Alexa 647 conjugate using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon
Instruments). Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 apparatus
(Axon Instruments). We used the Eisen CLUSTER and TREEVIEW programs

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

for hierarchical clustering and visualization of the data. Before applying the
clustering algorithm, we log transformed the fluorescence ratio for each
expression and then average centered the data for all samples.
Isolation of miRNA. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines and frozen
tissue samples using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described (16). Total
RNAs isolated from HCC and matching normal tissues were further
enriched using mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems).
Taq Man reverse transcription-PCR for quantification of miR-1. For
mature miR-1 detection, reverse transcription was performed following
Applied Biosystems Taq Man MicroRNA Assay protocol. PCR reaction
mixtures contained Taq Man human miR-1 and Universal PCR Master Mix
in a total volume of 20 AL. Cycling variables were as follows: 95jC for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles at 95jC (15 s) and annealing/extension at 60jC
(1 min). All reactions were performed in triplicate. MiR-1 expression was
normalized using 18S rRNA. The expression of miR-1 relative to 18S rRNA
was determined using 2 DCT method (33). An aliquot of cDNA (1.33 ng for
miR-1 and 5 pg 18S rRNA) were used for each assay.
Transfection of cells and reporter assay. Luciferase reporter plasmid
(pIS0) containing 3¶-UTR of FoxP1-or FoxP1-DmiR-1-3¶-UTR were transiently transfected with SV40-hgal plasmid into Hep3B cells. Briefly, the cells
were seeded into 24-well plates and, 24 h later, were cotransfected with
100 ng of pIS0 and 10 ng of pSV40-hgal along with 60 nmol/L hsa-pre-miR-1
or control RNA #1 or #2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and
resuspended in the lysis buffer [100 mmol/L potassium phosphate (pH 7.8),
0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mmol/L DTT] and followed by assay of luciferase
activity in a luminometer using the Dual-Light System (Applied Biosystems).
All experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and the results are mean
of three separate experiments.
Western blot analysis. HCC cells (3  105) were plated per 60-mm dish
24 h before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with 100 nmol/L
pre-miR-1 or negative control RNA as described above. HepG2 cells were
transfected with Mirus TransIT-siQuest (Mirus Bio Corporation) transfection reagent following the supplier’s protocol. After 24 h, cells were allowed
to grow in regular culture medium for an additional 24 h before further
studies. The whole cell extracts prepared after 48 h of transfection or from
5-AzaC–treated cells were immunoblotted with anti-MET, anti-HDAC4
(Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-FOXP1 (Abcam), and anti–glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Molecular Probes) antibodies following
published protocol (34). The signal was developed with ECL (GE Healthcare) after incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical testing was performed
using the Ventana Benchmark System (Ventana Medical Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Optimal detection of FoxP1,
c-MET, and HDAC4 required the antigen retrieval CC1 for 30 min and
dilutions of antibodies 1:1,000-, 1:500-, and 1:500-fold, respectively.
In situ hybridization. Our protocol for detection of RNAs by in situ
hybridization has been previously published (35). In brief, the tissue was
deparaffinized, proteased (30 min in 2 mg/mL of pepsin in RNase free
water), washed in sterile water, then 100% ethanol, and air dried. For each
miR studied, LNA modified cDNA probes were used. The probes were
labeled with the 3¶ oligonucleotide tailing kit using biotin as the reporter
nucleotide (Enzo Diagnostics). Hybridization was done at 37jC overnight
and followed by a wash in 0.2XSSC and 2% bovine serum albumin. The
probe-target complex was seen due to the action of alkaline phosphatase
(as part of the streptavidin complex) on the chromogen nitroblue
tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP; Enzo Diagnostics). Nuclear fast red served as the counterstain. The negative controls
were the omission of the probe and the use of a scrambled probe (the same
sequence as the miR cDNA but where the nucleotides have been
‘‘scrambled’’ at random so that is very low homology with the target
sequence).
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was monitored using Cell
Proliferation reagent kit I [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT); Roche Molecular Biochemicals]. HepG2 or Hep3B
cells (3,000 per well) transfected with pre-miR-1 or control pre-miR were
allowed to grow in 96-well plates. Cell proliferation was documented every

24 h following the manufacturer’s protocol. To measure cell proliferation,
10 AL of MTT labeling reagent I was added to each well and incubated at
37jC for 4 h followed by the addition of 100 AL solubilization reagent in
each well. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm in the ELISA reader (Tristar;
Berthold Technology) after overnight incubation.
DNA replication assay. Cells (10,000 per well) transfected with hsapre-miR-1 or control RNA were plated in 24-well plates in 1 mL culture
medium and incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified
incubator. After 48 h, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium
for an additional 16 h. Serum-free medium was replaced with complete
MEMa medium, and 30 min later, 1 ACi of 3H1-thymidine were added to each
well. Six hours later, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed
by estimation of 3H1 incorporation into DNA in a Hitachi scintillation
counter (27).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. To analyze DNA content,
HepG2 cells (5  105) transfected with hsa-pre-miR-1 or control RNA were
plated in 10-cm tissue culture plates and incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2
atmosphere in a humidified incubator. Cells were allowed to grow before
they were fixed and stained with propidium iodide solution (20 Ag/mL
propidium iodide, 200 Ag/mL RNase A) for 15 min at 37jC in the dark.
Cell were analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometric data were analyzed using Cell Quest Pro software (BD
Biosciences).
Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing.
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) database was used to identify
CpG islands (CGI) spanning miR-1-1 gene. The primers for Combined
Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) for all four CGIs were designed using
Methprimer software.6 Genomic DNA isolation and bisulfite conversion
were performed as described (36). Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, which
converts only unmethylated cytosines to uracils, was amplified with strandspecific primers followed by digestion with methylation-sensitive enzymes.
The primers used for amplification of different CGI on miR-1-1 gene are
described below.
miR1-CGI81-BSF1: TGGGGTTAAATTTATTTTGAATTTG and miR1CGI81-BSR1: ACTCCC CAACAAAAACCTACAC; miR1-CGI81-BSF2:

Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test. Box and
whisker plots were generated using QI Macros7 software.

Results
miR-1 is activated in HCC cells after treatment with
epigenetic drugs. Treatment of cancer cells with inhibitors of
DNMTs or HDACs inhibits cell growth by activating genes
encoding tumor suppressors, including some miRNAs (15, 29, 37).
To identify potential growth regulatory miRNAs silenced by
epigenetic mechanisms in HCC cells, we compared the miRNA
expression profiles of HepG2 and Hep3B cells treated with 5-AzaC
(DNA hypomethylating agent), TSA (HDAC inhibitor), or both to
those of untreated cells using miRNA microarray analysis. Cluster
analysis showed that treatment with these drugs deregulated
expression of 23 miRs in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Among these
miRs, miR-1-1 was significantly up-regulated (P V 0.0001) in both
cell lines upon treatment with 5-AzaC alone or in combination
with TSA.
Next, we validated up-regulation of miR-1 in different HCC
cells treated with 5-AzaC by real-time reverse transcription-PCR

(RT-PCR). miR-1 expression was almost undetectable in all six HCC
cell lines tested, which increased after treatment with 5-AzaC for
36 h (Fig. 1B, top). In HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1, and SNU-449, miR-1
level increased with increasing concentration of the drug from 1 to
5 Amol/L, whereas its maximal induction was observed in Huh-7
and peritoneal lymphocytes/PRF5 cells treated with 1 Amol/L
5-AzaC. The differential activation of miR-1 in different HCC cell
lines is likely due to differential availability of transcription factors
and chromatin structure. To confirm that the RT-PCR product is
indeed miR-1, we separated it on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel
and subjected to Northern blot analysis with antisense miR-1 as
probe. The results showed that miR-1 was barely detectable in
control HCC cells, which increased with increasing concentrations
of 5-AzaC (Fig. 1B, bottom). Overall, the real-time RT-PCR and
Northern blot data corroborated well with the microarray data
confirming that miR-1 is indeed silenced by epigenetic mechanism
in HCC.
We next measured the mature miR-1 levels in human primary
HCCs and matching liver tissues by real-time RT-PCR analysis that
showed significant reduction in miR-1 level in five HCCs relative to
the matched controls among six samples analyzed (Fig. 1C). In situ
hybridization of tissue sections with locked nucleic acid (LNA)modified antisense miR-1 oligo showed miR-1 expression in
many of the benign hepatocytes in the tissue adjacent to the
HCC (Fig. 1D). Hybridization to scrambled oligo did not generate
any signal (data not shown). The miR-1 expression was not evident
in the fibrotic foci of the cirrhotic livers. In comparison, miR-1
expression was much reduced in the HCCs being evident in rare
cancer cells. These results indicate that down-regulation of miR-1
occurs specifically in primary HCCs.
CGI of miR-1-1 is methylated in human HCC cells and
primary HCCs. Because miR-1-1 gene was activated in HCC cell
lines in response to 5-AzaC, we next explored its methylation status
in cell lines and primary liver tumors. Searching the UCSC database
revealed that miR-1 coded by an intron 1 of the putative ORF166 is
embedded in CGIs (Fig. 2A). We used COBRA to assess methylation
status of the largest CGI (CGI-81) spanning exon 1 and intron 1 in
HCC cells. The amplicon harbors one Taq I site that is retained
after bisulfite conversion provided genomic DNA is methylated.
PCR product from HepG2 cells was almost completely digested
with Taq I, whereas f50% of the amplicon from Huh7 cells
was cleaved with Taq I (Fig. 2B, left). Complete digestion of the
PCR products with Tsp509 I confirmed complete conversion of
unmethylated cytosines to uracils. These results show that the CGI
located upstream of miR-1 is methylated in both HCC cell lines. To
determine whether demethylation of CGI-81 indeed resulted in
miR-1-1 activation, we performed COBRA of genomic DNA
obtained from Huh7 cells treated with 5-AzaC. As expected, the
amplicon from 5-AzaC–treated cells was refractory to Aci I or Taq I
digestion compared with that from the control cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data show that the activation of miR-1-1
correlates with hypomethylation of its CGI upon 5-AzaC treatment.
Next, we examined the methylation status of CGI-81 in human
primary HCCs and matching liver tissues by COBRA. The
amplicon also harbors 4 Aci I sites. Digestion of the amplicon
with methylation-sensitive enzymes such as Taq I or Aci I
indicates methylation of genomic DNA. Analysis of four pairs of
human primary HCCs showed significant methylation at both
Aci I and Taq I sites in tumor T2 and at the Taq I site in T4
(Fig. 2B, right). A low-level methylation was observed at
both restriction enzyme sites in T1. In contrast, CGI-81 was

Figure 1. A, epigenetic drugs deregulate miR expression in HCC cells. Cluster analysis of differentially regulated miRNA in HCC cells after treatment with inhibitors
of DNA methyltransferase (5-azacytidine), HDAC (TSA), or both. Cells in log phase were treated with 5-AzaC (1 Amol/L) for 24 h followed by treatment with TSA
(0.3 Amol/L) for an additional 12 h. Cells treated with the vehicle (DMSO) or the drugs alone were used as the control. Total RNA isolated was subjected to miRNA
microarray analysis, and data were normalized to the average median of all the genes in the array. Hierarchical clustering was performed with the normalized,
log-transformed data using Cluster 3.0 and TREEVIEW software. The results are mean of two different batches of cells treated under identical conditions. Only 23
miRs were used for clustering, whose expression was >1.5 or <0.5 compared with the control cells. B, miR-1 expression is up-regulated in HCC cell lines upon
treatment with 5-AzaC. Top, cells in log phase were either untreated or treated with 1 Amol/L of 5-AzaC for 36 h. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of mature miR-1 was
performed using Taqman primers and probe. The data were normalized to 18S rRNA. Columns, mean of three replicates; bars, SD. Bottom, Northern blot analysis of

miR-1 probe. miR-1 was detected in the hepatocytes of a regenerating nodule in this section of cirrhotic liver adjacent to a HCC (positive is blue, due to NBT/BCIP;
negative cells pink from nuclear fast red counterstain); note the cytoplasmic localization. In comparison, miR-1 was not detected in the malignant hepatocytes
of the adjacent HCC.

methylation free at these restriction enzyme sites in all four
matching control livers because respective amplicon could not be
cleaved by Aci I or Taq I. Thus, miR-1 CGI-81 is specifically
methylated in human HCCs. We also measured methylation
status of other CGIs located upstream or downstream of miR-1-1
by COBRA, none of which was methylated in human livers,
primary HCCs, or HCC cell lines (data not shown).
To determine the methylation status of each CpGs within the
amplicon, we sequenced 12 randomly selected TA clones of PCR
products obtained from the liver and tumor of sample #2. The
results showed dense methylation of certain CpGs located in this
region of the tumor, whereas only a few scattered CpGs were
methylated in the matching liver DNA (Fig. 2C). Thus, methylation
of miR-1-1 CGI-81 in HCCs is a tumor-specific event.
In mammals, the genomic methylation pattern is initiated and
maintained by three essential DNA methyltransferases namely
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. In cancer cells, depending upon

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

the promoter, DNMT1 alone or in concert with DNMT3A/B maintain
methylation profile of methylated loci. To identify the enzyme
involved in the aberrant methylation of miR-1 in cancer cells, we
took advantage of a colon cancer cell line with targeted disruption of
DNMTs and analyzed methylation profile of CGI-81 in the wild-type,
DNMT1 / , DNMT3B / , and DKO (DNMT1 / DNMT3B / )
cells. Almost 50% digestion with each enzyme indicates that miR-1 is
methylated in the parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 2D, top). It is
noteworthy that in DNMT3B null cells, Aci I completely and Taq I
partially cleaved the amplicon. In contrast, the PCR product was
minimally (f8%) cleaved in DNMT1 null cells and was totally
resistant to digestion in DKO cells, indicating that DNMT1 plays a
key role in aberrant methylation of miR-1 in HCT116 and probably in
HCC cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the disruption of
DNMT1 alone could induce miR-1 expression in nonexpressing
parental HCT cells, which was further up-regulated in DKO cells
(Fig. 2D, bottom). miR-1 was induced at a low level also in

Role of microRNA-1 in Liver Tumorigenesis

DNMT3B / cells. These results strongly suggest inverse correlation between CGI-81 methylation and miR-1-1 activation.
Ectopic expression of miR-1 reverses cancer cell–specific
phenotype of HCC cells. Because the demethylating agent
reactivated methylated miR-1-1 gene in HCC cells, the next series
of experiments were performed to determine the function of miR-1
in HCC cells. miR-1 is abundantly expressed in the heart and
smooth muscle where it inhibits cell cycle progression of cardiac
progenitors and promotes their differentiation (38, 39). We
entertained the possibility that the low-level expression of miR-1
in other tissues such as liver (40) may be involved in controlling
proliferation and/or maintaining differentiated state of the
hepatocytes. If this is true, ectopic expression of miR-1 in
nonexpressing HCC cell lines should reverse their cancer cell–
specific phenotype. Because miR-1 level is undetectable in HCC cell
lines tested (Fig. 1), we transiently transfected cells with hsa-premiR-1 (miR-1) or negative control RNAs (that do not have
homology to any mammalian RNA) and analyzed phenotypes of
these cells. Overexpression of miR-1 in HepG2 cells increased
mature miR-1 expression f5000-fold, which was significantly less
than its constitutive level in the heart (Fig. 3A). The proliferation
rate of miR-1–expressing cells was markedly reduced compared
with those transfected with the control RNA. MTT assay showed
f25% reduction in growth of miR-1–expressing cells at all time
points tested (Fig. 3B, left). Significant decrease in replication

potential as measured by incorporation of 3H1-thymidine in HepG2
cells upon ectopic expression of miR-1 confirmed its growth
inhibitory potential (Fig. 3B, right). Furthermore, clonogenic
survival of these cells was reduced by f60% (P = 0.005) upon
ectopic expression of miR-1 (Fig. 3C). Reproducible results were
obtained with three different batches of transfected cells as well as
with two different control miRs (data not shown).
To rule out the possibility that the growth inhibitory property of
miR-1 is restricted to HepG2 cells, we studied its function in
another HCC cell line (Hep3B). The expression of mature miR-1
was elevated 155-fold in cells transfected with miR-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Ectopic expression of miR-1 led to f20%
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) and f75% reduction (Supplementary
Fig. S2C) in growth of Hep3B cells and replication potential of miR1–expressing cells, respectively, compared with the cells expressing
control miRs. As observed for HepG2 cells, ectopic miR-1 reduced
clonogenic survival of Hep3B cells by 38% (P = 0.018; Supplementary Fig. S2D). Taken together, these results indicate significantly
reduced ability of miR-1–overexpressing HCC cells to maintain
their tumorigenic properties.
Ectopic expression of miR-1 inhibits growth of HCC cells by
inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell cycle progression. To
elucidate the mechanism of miR-1–mediated inhibition of HCC cell
growth, we analyzed cell cycle profile of HepG2 cells transfected
with hsa-miR-1 and control RNA. Fluorescence-activated cell

sorting (FACS) analysis of propidium iodide–stained cells at
different days showed that in control cells at day 0, nearly 65% of
the cells were in G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 3D). At day
2, a large portion of the control cells from the G1 phase progressed
to S and G2-M phases. At this time point, a dramatic decrease
(f20%) in the number of cells in G1 phase was observed compared
with that at day 0 (Supplementary Fig S3; Fig. 3D). Furthermore,
f14% and 5% increase in the cell numbers were observed in S and
G2-M phase, respectively, indicating a significant (f20%) distribution in growth phase. In contrast, the miR-1–overexpressing cells
exhibited very little cell cycle progression at day 2. Only f2%
decrease in cell number was noticed in G1 phase compared with
that at day 0. At this time point, the number of cells in S phase
decreased by 4% and f2% more cells were accumulated in the
G2-M phase. Again, a relatively large proportion (f5-fold and f16fold at day 0 and day 2, respectively, compared with control) of the
miR-1–overexpressing cells were apoptotic (sub-G0 phase) compared with that in nonexpressing cells (f0.4%; Supplementary
Fig. S3; Fig. 3D). These data revealed that both cell cycle arrest
and induction of apoptosis contribute to growth inhibitory
property of miR-1.
FOXP1 and MET are targets of miR-1. Next, we explored the
underlying molecular mechanism of antitumorigenic property of
miR-1 in HCC cells. Because miRNAs primarily mediate their
biological functions in animal cells by impeding expression of
target genes, we searched for its potential targets that exhibit
oncogenic properties. Different target prediction algorithms
(MiRanda, TargetScan, and Pictar) identified forkhead box
transcription factor FOXP1 as a potential target of miR-1. It
harbors 3 miR-1 recognition sites in its 3¶-UTR among which two
are in close proximity (Fig. 4A). FoxP1, a member of F box family of
ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, plays a critical role in
development (41, 42). This dysregulated factor can act as an
oncoprotein or a tumor suppressor depending upon the cellular
context. To assess whether miR-1 can directly alter the expression
of FOXP1, a region (1-2192) of the 3¶-UTR of FOXP1 mRNA,
containing two putative miR-1 binding sites in close proximity
(752–780 and 795–827) and the 3¶UTR depleted of these sites, were
cloned into a firefly luciferase reporter vector pIS0 (43). These
constructs were cotransfected into Hep3B cells along with premiR–1 or control RNA. SV40-hGAL plasmid was cotransfected to
monitor transfection efficiency. Ectopic miR-1 significantly (60%)
reduced luciferase activity driven by the wild-type FOXP1 3¶-UTR
(pIS0-FoxP1-3¶UTR) compared with the control (Fig. 4B). In
contrast, pre-miR-1 could not inhibit luciferase activity of pIS0FoxP1-D3¶-UTR lacking both miR-1 sites. MiR-1 had no significant
effect on pIS0, the parental vector (data not shown). These results
suggest that miR-1 can block translation of a chimeric protein
harboring two miR-1 complimentary sites of FoxP1 in its 3¶-UTR.
To confirm that FOXP1 is indeed the target of miR-1 in HCC cells,
we measured endogenous FoxP1 level in HCC cells expressing
ectopic miR-1 or control RNA. Western blot analysis of whole cell
extracts showed that the steady-state level of FoxP1 was reduced by
f40% and f60% in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, respectively, by
ectopic miR-1 (Fig. 4C and D).
MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), a proto-oncogene,
which harbors two conserved miR-1 cognate sites, is another target
predicted by different databases. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) family of oncogenes overexpressed in many human cancers
(44–46). This RTK consists of disulfide-linked subunits of 50 kDa
(a) and 145 kDa (h) processed from the same precursor

formed were stained with crystal violet and photographed. The total number of

both Hep3B and HepG2 cells upon ectopic expression of miR-1
(Fig. 4C and D).
HDACs play an important role in cancer development, and
several HDAC inhibitors are in clinical trials for treating a variety of
malignancies (28, 47). HDAC4 is a validated target of miR-1 (39).
We confirmed that HDAC4 level was indeed reduced in HCC cells
expressing miR-1 (Fig. 4C and D). These results, taken together,
show that the expressions of three key targets of miR-1, namely,
FOXP1, MET, and HDAC4, are negatively regulated by miR-1 in
HCC cells.
FoxP1, MET, and HDAC4 levels are down-regulated in HCC
cells upon treatment with 5-azacytidine. If activation of miR-1 is
one of the mechanisms by which 5-AzaC mediates its growth
inhibitory function, it is expected that the expression of miR-1
targets should decrease in cells upon treatment with the DNA
hypomethylating agent. To test this possibility, we monitored the
levels of miR-1 targets in the drug-treated cell extracts by
immunoblot analysis. The results showed a dose-dependent
decrease in FoxP1, MET, and HDAC4 protein levels, albeit at
different levels, in all six HCC cell lines treated with the 5-AzaC
(Fig. 5A–D). The differential response is likely due to different
origin of these cell lines and involvement of additional factors in
the down-regulation of these miR-1 targets.
FoxP1 and MET are overexpressed in human primary HCC.
Next, we measured the expression of these miR-1 targets in 11
human primary HCC samples by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. The results showed significant up-regulation of

FoxP1 and MET in majority of the HCCs compared with the
matching liver tissues (Fig. 6A and B). The levels of FoxP1 and MET
increased in nine and seven HCC samples, respectively, compared
with the corresponding matching livers. HDAC4 was elevated in six
HCC samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of HCC sections also
revealed that these proteins are expressed in malignant hepatocytes (a representative picture is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4).
These data suggest that the up-regulation of oncogenic FoxP1 and
MET contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis and down-regulation of
miR-1 is likely to be one of the factors that contributes to this
process. The present study also showed that the therapeutic
intervention with DNA hypomethylating agents could inhibit HCC
cell growth by reducing expression of oncogenes such as MET and
FoxP1. The up-regulation of HDAC4 in primary HCCs suggests the
usefulness of combination therapy (DNMT and HDAC inhibitors)
against liver cancers.

Discussion
Like many growth regulatory genes, the genes encoding some
mircroRNAs contain CGIs that are susceptible to methylationmediated silencing. The major objective of the present study was to
identify growth regulatory miRNAs and to determine whether reexpression of these miRs by treatment with DNA hypomethylating
agents or other epigenetic drugs can inhibit growth of HCCs by
altering expressions of specific target genes. Recent studies have
shown that DNA demethylating agents can re-express silenced

Figure 4. FoxP1 is a validated target of miR-1. A, the 3¶-UTR of FoxP1 harbors 3 miR-1 binding sites. B, luciferase activity controlled by 3¶UTR of FoxP1 is inhibited
by ectopic expression of pre-miR-1. Hep3B cells were cotransfected with firefly luciferase-3¶UTR (FoxP1) and pre-miR-1 or control RNA (60 nmol/L) along with
SV40-h-gal (as internal control). After 48 h, luciferase and h-galactosidase activities were measured in cell extracts. FoxP1-3¶UTR deleted of miR-1 sites were used
as control. C and D, extracts from cells transfected with pre-miR-1 or control miR for 48 h were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies as indicated.
The signal in each band in the scanned X-ray film was quantified using KODAK imaging software, and the levels were normalized to that of GAPDH.

miRs such as miR-127 and miR-124b with growth suppressor
properties (12, 13). The present study showed methylation
mediated suppression of miR-1 gene and its re-expression upon
treatment of HCC cells with 5-AzaC, which suggested its potential
function as growth suppressor. Interestingly, disruption of one of
the two isoforms of miR-1 (miR-1-2) in murine heart resulted in
induction of cell cycle regulatory genes with concomitant entry of
terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes into cell cycle (39). The
methylation-mediated silencing of miR-1 in primary HCCs and upregulation of its potential oncogenic targets implicated its potential
antitumorigenic function in the liver. Indeed, ectopic expression of
miR-1 in nonexpressing HCC cell lines at a much lower level than
that in the heart reversed many characteristics of cancer cells such
as growth, replication potential, clonogenic survival, and resistance
to apoptosis. Up-regulation of miR-1 targets such as FoxP1 and
MET with oncogenic property in HCCs further explains growth
regulatory functions of miR-1 in the liver and probably in other
tissues by predisposing these tissues to neoplastic transformation
due to loss of miR-1.
MicroRNA-1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue, smooth,
and skeletal muscle due to its induction by serum response factor.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

It promotes differentiation of the heart tissue by reducing
expression of repressors such as Hand2 and Hdac4 (39, 48).
Cloning of miR-1 from mouse liver RNA by Lagos-Quintana
confirmed that it is also expressed in the liver albeit at a lower level
(40). Hsa-miR-1 is located in the intron 1 of the putative ORF166
that harbors several CGIs of which CGI-81 is methylated in tumorspecific manner. There was no detectable methylation at other
CGIs located upstream or downstream of miR-1-1 gene in the livers
or tumors (data not shown). These results suggest that the altered
chromatin structure spanning CGI-81 in cancer cell predisposes it
to methylation. Even within CGI-81, methylation was restricted to
certain CpGs in the amplicon of HCC sample 2. Methylation may
affect expression of miR-1-1 by inhibiting access of one or more
transcription factors to their cognate sites in the chromatin
context. Indeed, TESS8 database identified cognate sites for several
transcription factors such as USF, and ATF/cAMP-responsive
element binding protein, whose DNA binding activities are
sensitive to methylation (49).

Role of microRNA-1 in Liver Tumorigenesis

Figure 6. FoxP1, MET, and HDAC4 are
elevated in primary human HCCs. A, whole
cell extracts of HCCs and matching
control tissues were subjected to Western
blot analysis with antibodies specific
for FOXP1, MET, HDAC4, and Ku-70
(used as loading control). B, quantitative
representation of the data using Box and
Whisker plots. A horizontal line in each
box represents the median value of each
protein level in each group. Box denotes
25th and 75th percentile range of scores,
whereas whiskers represent the highest
and lowest values.

Prediction of a few oncogenic targets of miR-1 by multiple
databases provided the rationale to explore growth suppressor
function of miR-1. One such target FoxP1 is unique because it can
act as an oncoprotein and tumor suppressor depending upon the
tissue type (41). The significant up-regulation of FoxP1 protein in
human primary HCCs suggests its potential role in tumorigenesis.
MET is an RTK frequently up-regulated in different types of cancers
and amplified during the metastatic transition of primary tumors.
Many genes that are targets of MET signaling pathway are involved
in the regulation of various cellular functions, including mitogenesis, proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and
metastasis. Furthermore, the MET-induced gene expression
signature is shared by human HCC and almost all liver metastases
(46). It is conceivable that significant down-regulation of MET
protein level mediated by ectopic expression of miR-1 in HCC cell
lines presumably leads to reduced cell proliferation due to cell cycle
arrest, replication potential, clonogenic survival, and induced
apoptosis. The down-regulation of these oncoproteins by ectopic
miR-1 suggests the potential therapeutic application of miR-1
mimetics against hepatocarcinogenesis.
Finally, the clinical application of HDAC inhibitors underscores the
role of HDACs in tumorigenesis. HDAC4 is a class II HDAC that is
recruited by sequence-specific transcription factors to repress
differentiation-promoting genes (50). It is translocated to the nucleus
in response to growth factors through Ras signaling pathway. Thus,
the increased expression and/or nuclear translocation of HDAC4 in
the liver probably stimulate cellular transformation by promoting

dedifferentiation of hepatocytes. In this context, HDAC4 behaves as an
oncoprotein. Its nuclear/cytoplasmic export is regulated by phosphorylation. The posttranscriptional regulation of its expression by miR-1 is
another mechanism that facilitates tightly controlled expression of this
enzyme. The up-regulation of miR-1 with concomitant downregulation of its targets in HCC cells in response to chromatin
modifying agents rationalizes their potential clinical application
against liver cancers.
In summary, our results suggest that the activation of silent miR1-1 by chromatin modifiers could lead to suppression of target
oncogenic proteins that are crucial in the development and
progression of human cancer. Future studies in epigenetic
regulation of miR-1 expression coupled to downstream signaling
pathways is likely to lead to development of novel drug targets in
liver cancer therapy.
