Abstract

Author Manuscript

In mouse mammary epithelial cells, CPEB1 mediates the apical localization of ZO-1 mRNA,
which encodes a critical tight junction component. In mice lacking CPEB1 and in cultured cells
from which CPEB has been depleted, randomly distributed ZO-1 mRNA leads to the loss of cell
polarity. We have investigated whether this diminution of polarity results in an epithelial-tomesenchyme (EMT) transition and possible increased metastatic potential. Here, we show that
CPEB1-depleted mammary epithelial cells alter their gene expression profile in a manner
consistent with an EMT and also become motile, which are made particularly robust when cells
are treated with TGF-β, an enhancer of EMT. CPEB1-depleted mammary cells become metastatic
to the lung following injection into mouse fat pads while ectopically-expressed CPEB1 prevents
metastasis. Surprisingly, CPEB1 depletion causes some EMT/metastasis-related mRNAs to have
shorter poly(A) tails while other mRNAs to have longer poly(A) tails. Matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9) mRNA, which encodes a metastasis-promoting factor, undergoes poly(A) lengthening
and enhanced translation upon CPEB reduction. Moreover, in human breast cancer cells that
become progressively more metastatic, CPEB1 is reduced while MMP9 becomes more abundant.
These data suggest that at least in part, CPEB1 regulation of MMP9 mRNA expression mediates
metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Introduction
The Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein 1 (CPEB1) is a sequencespecific RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA translation by dynamically controlling
poly(A) tail length. CPEB1 anchors the non-canonical poly(A) polymerases Gld2 or Gld4,
as well as the deadenylating enzyme PARN (poly(A) ribonuclease), to mRNA 3′
untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE). By
doing so and in response to phosphorylation/dephoshorylation events on serine 174 or
threonine 171 (species-dependent), CPEB1 regulates poly(A) tail growth or removal, which
consequently promotes or represses translation, respectively.1–4 The biological
manifestations of CPEB1 regulation include control of gametogenesis, cell cycle
progression, cellular senescence, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and higher cognitive
function and neurologic disease.1,4–11

In addition to mediating the levels of specific protein synthesis, CPEB1 also coordinates
where mRNAs are translated by regulating their subcellular localization. In oocytes, for
example, CPE-containing RNAs are localized to the centrosome and mitotic spindles by
CPEB1, where they are translated into proteins that promote cell division.12–14 In neurons,
CPEB1 is involved in RNA transport into dendrites where they are translated in synaptodendritic compartments in response to synaptic stimulation.15–19 In mouse mammary
epithelial cells, CPEB1-regulated RNA localization is important for cell polarity. This
phenomenon was first detected in CPEB1-deficient mice where mammary epithelial cells
exhibit disrupted polarity as indicated by impaired co-localization of the tight junction
proteins ZO-1 and apical protein syntaxin-3 and increased improper co-localization of ZO-1
and the baso-lateral protein E-cadherin.20 In cultured mouse EpH4 mouse mammary cells,
epithelial sheets are formed with ZO-1 localized apically and E-cadherin localized basolaterally; when CPEB1 is depleted, this two-dimensional polarity is lost and ZO-1 is
aberrantly distributed baso-laterally. Three-dimensional cultures of EpH4 cells, which when
grown in an anchorage-independent manner form hollow lumen much like mammary gland
terminal end buds (TEBs),21 also lose their polarity following CPEB1 depletion and do not
contain a hollow cavity. Under normal conditions, CPEB1 and the CPE-containing ZO-1
mRNA are co-localized apically where translation takes place. When CPEB1 is depleted,
ZO-1 mRNA translation occurs without spatial specification, thereby resulting in loss of cell
polarity.20

Author Manuscript

Epithelial cells that lose their strong apposition and adhesiveness through tight junctions can
experience an epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT), a state of dedifferentiation often
linked to increased metastatic potential.22,23 EMTs are characterized by altered morphology
of cells from, for example, planar epithelial sheets to loosely dispersed cells with a spindleshaped mesenchymal phenotype that is conducive to cell migration. A number of molecular
markers are used to define an EMT, most prominently the down-regulation of E-cadherin
and the up-regulation of N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin, twist, snail, slug and others.23,24
Cells that have experienced an EMT can colonize distant tissues via the bloodstream; if such
cells are derived from a malignant tumor, the colonization represents the metastatic spread of
cancer.23,25

Because CPEB1 depletion results in the loss of apical-basal polarity of mammary epithelial
cells, we suspected it might presage an EMT and as result possibly enhance their metastatic
potential. Indeed, CPEB1 depletion from mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells, when
combined with administration of TGF-β, an enhancer of EMT,26 causes molecular
alterations that are consistent with EMT. CPEB1-depleted cells also become more motile,
another trait that characterizes EMT. Mouse mammary 4T1 epithelial cells, which are highly
metastatic, express little detectable CPEB1. However, ectopic expression of CPEB1 in these
cells significantly reduces metastasis to the lung following injection into the fat pads of
mice. Conversely, MCF7 human mammary epithelial cells are not metastatic and express
high levels of CPEB1. When depleted of CPEB1, they become metastatic to the lung. An
analysis of EMT-related RNAs that undergo changes in poly(A) tail size in mouse mammary
cells following CPEB1 depletion revealed several that had reduced poly(A) and very
surprisingly, others that gained poly(A). One mRNA that gained poly(A) and whose
translation was elevated following CPEB1 reduction encodes matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9), a metastasis-stimulatory enzyme whose levels are inverse to that of CPEB1 in
human breast metastases. These data suggest that depletion of CPEB1 not only causes loss
of mammary epithelial cell polarity, but that it also leads to EMT and increased metastasis
possibly by altering the translational efficiency of MMP9 mRNA.

CPEB1 Regulates Cell Motility

To determine whether reduction of CPEB1 results in characteristics that resemble EMT or
tumorigenesis, NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells were infected with lentivirus
expressing an shRNA for CPEB1, which we have previously shown specifically depletes
CPEB1.20 Although the shRNA effectively reduced CPEB1, it had no effect on cell
proliferation irrespective of whether growth-promoting fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added
to the culture medium (Figure 1a and b). In a cell motility assay a score was made through
confluent cells and the rate at which the border cells infiltrated the scratch was determined.
Figure 1c shows that depletion of CPEB1 stimulated the rate of repopulation of the score
compared to control cells in this 2 dimensional migration assay. CPEB1 depletion also
elicited an increase in N-cadherin (Cdh2) levels and a decrease in E-cadherin levels (Cdh1),
which are consistent with induction of an EMT (Figure 1d, western blots and
immunocytochemistry). However, Zeb1, another EMT marker was unaffected by CPEB1
knockdown. CPEB1 depletion also enhanced cell migration in a Transwell assay, but had no
effect on cell invasiveness in matrigel or a tumorigenesis-related phenotype based on growth
in soft agar (Figure 1e). These data indicate that CPEB1 controls cell motility and is likely to
be involved in EMT, but probably does not influence oncogenic transformation.
TGF-β Potentiates CPEB1-Mediation of EMT
Although the loss of CPEB1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells prevented the establishment
of apical-basal polarity,20 it did not obviously induce an EMT, at least based on cell
morphology and notwithstanding its stimulation of cell migration, it did not stimulate cell
invasiveness (Figure 1). Because TGF-β potentiates EMT,26 we surmised that simultaneous
treatment of NMuMG cells with CPEB1 shRNA and this growth factor might induce EMT

(TGF-β treatment reduces CPEB mRNA, Supplementary Figure S1a). Consequently, we
determined whether TGF-β enhances the expression of EMT markers in the presence or
absence of CPEB1. TGF-β treatment elicited a more profound decrease of both ZO-1 and Ecadherin when CPEB1 was depleted. Conversely, this same regimen evoked enhanced
expression of N-cadherin as well as Zeb1 (Figure 2a), all of which are consistent with the
induction of EMT. Immunocytochemical analysis also showed reduction of E-cadherin and
fiber structure of F-actin upon TGF-β treatment and CPEB1 depletion (Figure 2b). To gain a
greater sense of the degree of EMT induction as noted above, RNA from control or CPEB1
knockdown cells treated with TGF-β were use to screen a microarray specific for EMT
marker sequences. Supplementary Figure S2 shows that in a manner consistent with an
EMT, many markers were up or down-regulated in CPEB1 knockdown cells. Similar to
protein levels, RNAs that encode N-cadherin (Cdh2) and Zeb1 increased, conversely, Ecadherin (Cdh1) decreased. Taken together, these data indicate that TGF-β enhances EMT
when CPEB1 is depleted.
CPEB1 Regulates Mammary Epithelial Cell Metastasis

Author Manuscript

Mouse mammary Eph4 and NMUMG cells, which express relatively high levels of CPEB1
have low metastatic potential, Conversely, 4T1 cells, which have nearly undetectable levels
of CPEB1, are highly metastatic (Supplementary Figure S1b). This correlation between
CPEB1 and metastatic potential is also conserved in human cells. In the relatively nonmetastatic mammary epithelial cells MCF10A and MCF7, CPEB1 levels are high; in
contrast the highly metastatic MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 cells CPEB1 levels are low
(Supplementary Figure S1b). These data suggest a strong inverse correlation between
CPEB1 and metastasis. To begin to assess whether this relationship is causal, we ectopically
expressed CPEB1 in 4T1 cells that are normally deficient for this protein, did not alter ZO-1
or E-cadherin levels (Figure 3a) (N-cadherin and Zeb1analysis was ambiguous) or affect cell
proliferation (Figure 3b). However, ectopic CPEB1 significantly reduced cell migration
when analyzed by a scratch assay (Figure 3c) and repressed cell migration and invasiveness
while having no effect on cell growth in soft agar (Figure 3d).

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether ectopic CPEB1 regulates tumor growth and/or metastasis in vivo,
4T1 cells infected with a retrovirus expressing CPEB1 were injected into the fatpads of
mice. Several days after inoculation, tumor size was determined as was the incidence of
metastasis to the lung. Figure 3e shows that by 3 weeks, ectopic CPEB1 retarded tumor cell
growth by ~25%, which is surprising given that CPEB1 had no effect on cell proliferation in
vitro (panel b). Perhaps this reflects an intrinsic difference between in vitro and in vivo
growth control. In the control lung, metastasized 4T1 cells formed a solid mass with
heightened vasculature, which was not the case with CPEB1-expressign cells (Figure 3f).
When the 4T1 tumor reached 1000 mm3 it was isolated from the lung and the disaggregated
cells were cultured with 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), which is toxic only to normal cells. Figure
3g shows that the metastatic 4T1 cells were strongly resistant to 6-TGN and formed many
colonies in vitro, which was not the case when CPEB1 was ectopically expressed. These
data show an inverse correlation between CPEB1 expression and mammary epithelial cell
metastasis.

To assess whether the high level of CPEB1 in human mammary epithelial MCF7 cells is at
least partially causative for their inability to metastasize, we infected them with lentiviruses
expressing GFP and 2 different shRNAs for CPEB1 or a control shRNA. CPEB1 RNA was
depleted by >90% with specific shRNAs (Figure 4a), which dramatically stimulated cell
motility as revealed by a wound-healing scratch assay (Figure 4b). CPEB1 depletion also
stimulated migration (Figure 4d) and invasiveness (Figure 4d) in anchorage-independent
assays but had no effect on growth in soft agar (Figure 4e). CPEB1-depletion also had no
effect on tumor size when the transduced MCF-7 cells were injected into the fatpad of nude
(athymic) mice (Figure 4f). Most importantly, however, CPEB1 knockdown with two
different shRNAs produced cell metastasis to the lung. Compared to controls, there was
detectable colonization of GFP-positive and CPEB1-depleted MCF7 cells in the lung
(Figure 4g). Moreover, RT-PCR analysis showed that GFP RNA levels in the lung were high
when CPEB1 was depleted (Figure 4g). Therefore, the data in Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate
that high levels of CPEB1 are refractory to mammary cell metastasis to the lung.
CPEB1 Regulates mRNA Poly(A) tail Growth and Removal

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because many mRNAs contain 3′ UTR CPE-like sequences, it seems implausible that the
mis-regulation of a single or even a few mRNAs upon CPEB1 depletion promotes
metastasis. Even so, we have sought to identify mRNA targets of CPEB1 that we surmise are
likely to be involved in metastasis. Although CPEB1 controls RNA metabolism through
alternative splicing,27 RNA localization,16,21 translational repression,e.g.,2,8 and translational
activation,4 the most prevalent form of regulation is translational activation via cytoplasmic
polyadenylation. Consequently, we thought changes in poly(A) tail length might occur
during EMT and thus promote metastasis at least in part by this mechanism. To test this
possibility, NMuMG cells were depleted of CPEB1 and treated with TGF-β; extracted RNA
was then subjected to chromatography on poly(U) agarose followed by thermal elution.18,28
The RNAs eluting at 60°C were then used to screen an EMT PCR microarray.
Supplementary Figure S3 shows that of the 84 RNAs on the array, 14 underwent detectable
poly(A) tail size changes. Surprisingly, CPEB1 depletion caused some mRNAs to gain tails
while causing others to lose tails. The growth in poly(A) was unexpected because in all
cases so far examined, the loss of CPEB1 leads to poly(A) tail reduction, not
elongation.e.g.,5,29 We were particularly intrigued by the potential increase in MMP9 mRNA
polyadenylation because high levels of the encoded protein are known to promote
metastasis.30 A validation of the polyadenylation by a PCR-based assay shows that indeed
MMP9 mRNA, but not E-cadherin mRNA, underwent poly(A) tail lengthening upon CPEB1
depletion (Figure 5a) even though both are co-immunoprecipitated with CPEB (Figure 5b).
Moreover, MMP9 protein increased by nearly 50% following CPEB1 knockdown (Figure
5c). Thus, the loss of CPEB1 results in increased polyadenylation and translation of MMP9
mRNA.
CPEB1 Levels are Inversely Correlated with Human Breast Cancer Metastasis
To assess whether loss of MMP9 recovered high cell invasiveness by CPEB1 knockdown,
we transduced CPEB1-depleted MCF7 cells with a siRNA for MMP9. The siRNA, which
caused a reduction of MMP9 protein by ~40%, significantly reduced cell migration in vitro
(Figures 6b). We also injected MMP9 siRNA-transduced cells into mouse fatpads to assess

metastasis to the lung in vivo, however, because the siRNA was not retained at a high level
in the cells due to both instability and dilution as the cells divided, there was little effect on
metastasis.

Author Manuscript

We screened 49 human tissue samples corresponding to normal breast, stage IIA-IIB breast
cancer, and stage IIIA-IIIC metastatic breast cancer tissue samples with antibodies for
CPEB1 and MMP9. Based on the fluorescence signal intensities, the ratio of CPEB1 to
MMP9 decreased about 40% between normal and stage IIIA-IIIC metastatic breast cancer,
which reflects both a decrease in CPEB1 and an increase in MMP9 (Figure 6c). The inverse
relationship between these two proteins during metastasis is evident in Figure 6d.
Immunocytochemistry for CPEB1 and MMP9 shows that as the degree of metastasis
increased from normal to stage IIIC, CPEB1 fell dramatically while MMP9 exhibited an
equally robust increase. These data, together with those outlined above, indicate that the
reduction of CPEB1 leads to increased MMP9 mRNA polyadenylation and translation and
resulting enhanced metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

CPEB1 depletion from primary mouse or human cells makes them refractory to cellular as
well as oncogene-induced senescence, which is caused by reduced p53 mRNA
translation.2,8,9,31,32 However, with the exception of an acceleration of cutaneous papillomas
in CPEB1 knockout mice treated with 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and the
phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA),9 little evidence suggests that the
lack of CPEB1 promotes tumor growth. Indeed, although MEFs derived from CPEB1 KO
mice are immortal, they do not form tumors in nude mice.8 On the other hand, CPEB1
depletion disrupts polarity in mammary epithelial cells,21 and although this would not be
predicted to induce tumor formation, it could initiate an EMT and potentiate metastasis.
Moreover, other emerging evidence has linked CPEB1 levels to EMT, primarily through
translational control of TWIST mRNA.33,34 Indeed, our study confirms a number of
conclusions reached by Grudzien-Nogalska et al34, who performed an extensive in vitro
study of the relationship between CPEB1 and EMT. In our case, we find that CPEB1
depletion not only induces an EMT in vitro (as previously shown by Grudzien-Nogalska et
al34), but indeed also promotes metastasis of mammary cells to the lung in vivo. Although
we not observe that CPEB1 modifies TWIST mRNA poly(A) tail length or translation, we
surprisingly found that CPEB1 depletion stimulates MMP9 mRNA polyadenylation and
translation. Moreover, we found that at least in vitro, depletion of MMP9, a key metastasispromoting factor, decreases cell migration in CPEB1-depleted cells. An interesting corollary
is our observation that as human breast cancer cells become progressively more metastatic,
CPEB1 decreases and MMP9 increases. These data suggest that the diminution of CPEB1
during EMT gives rise to an increase in MMP9, which in turn promotes metastasis.
CPEB1 alters gene expression in three different ways as cells become metastatic. First, the
loss of mammary epithelial polarity by CPEB1 depletion is due to mis-localization of ZO-1
mRNA with no detectable effect on polyadenylation or translation.20 Second, when CPEB1depleted cells are treated with TGF-β to potentiate EMT,35,36 there are substantial alterations
in the levels of mRNAs that encode EMT-relevant proteins. Third, CPEB1 depletion

increases the polyadenylation and translation of MMP9 mRNA, which promotes metastasis.
How can CPEB1 affect these processes by different mechanisms? CPEB1 is already known
to regulate mRNA localization by virtue of its binding to the molecular motors kinesin and
dynein,16 and it could mediate ZO-1 mRNA localization to the apical region of mammary
epithelial cells by these or other molecular motors. CPEB1 control of polyadenylation is
regulated by its association with non-canonical poly(A) polymerases and
deadenylases.2,13,37 Therefore, it is likely that in some circumstances or cell types, CPEB1
interacts with factors to regulate polyadenylation while in other cell types, such interactions
may not occur and thus CPEB1 affects RNA metabolism in other ways.

Author Manuscript

We found that CPEB1 depletion stimulated polyadenylation of MMP9 mRNA, which was
surprising because the loss of CPEB1 would be expected to reduce polyadenylation. How
this could occur is unclear, but one possibility is that CPEB1 association with MMP9 RNA
might preclude the binding of a different protein (e.g., FMRP)38 that in turn recruits the noncanonical poly(A) polymerases Gld2 or Gld4. Such a situation could be analogous to control
of alternative splicing, where an RNA binding protein prevents the association of the
splicing machinery for some exons but not others.39

Author Manuscript

Our results show that in vivo, reduced CPEB1 levels promote metastasis of breast cancer
cells to the lung whereas ectopic expression of CPEB1 strongly inhibits it, suggesting that
CPEB1 could be a good prognosticator of human breast cancer metastasis. The extent to
which CPEB1 mediates metastasis of other cell types is unclear. The loss of CPEB1 has no
effect on polarity in intestinal or kidney epithelial cells,20 and if one assumes this is an
essential initiating event, then CPEB1 would not be expected to have much of an influence
on metastasis in these cells. Moreover, in glioblastoma cells, ectopic expression of a
dominant negative CPEB1 that cannot stimulate polyadenylation blocks expression of
metadherin (MRDH), a metastasis-promoting factor and reduces cell migration and tumor
growth.40 Because these observations are seemingly the opposite of what we observe in
breast cancer cells, it appears that CPEB1 can have diametrically opposed effects on
metastasis depending on the cell type.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2000 cells/well in complete
medium. At 24h and 48h time points, cell proliferation was measured using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For the wound-healing scratch assays, cells were grown in monolayers on 6-well plates and
scored with a pipette tip. After 24h, cell migration was assessed.
For the migration and invasion assays, 24well-Transwells (Costar) coated without or with
Matrigel (BD Bioscience) were used. Cells at concentrations of 50000 cells/well were
seeded in the top well with DMEM containing 5 ng/ml TGF-β and were allowed to migrate

Cells (1 × 106) were injected into the no. 4 or no. 9 fatpad of 8 week old female BALB/c
mice for 4T1 cells (n=21) and BALB/c nude mice for MCF7 cells (n=18) using a 30-gauge
needle. After 1 week, tumor sizes were subsequently measured every 3 days and the tumor
volumes were estimated as long axis × (short axis)2 × 0.5. For 4T1 cells, when tumor size
reached ~1000 mm3, lung samples were collected from animals, minced into small pieces
with scissors and digested in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1 mg/ml
collagenase-A (Roche) for 75 min at 4 °C. After the enzyme digestion, samples were filtered
through 70-μm nylon cell strainers (BD Bioscience), washed with HBSS and then suspended
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic reagent, and 60 μM 6thioguanine. After culturing for 2 weeks, the cells were fixed by 10% formalin and stained
with 0.03% methylene blue, and blue colonies were counted. For MCF7 cells, when tumors
were ~1500 mm3, lung samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for GFP
detection. All experiments with mice were performed according to the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture and
Technology.

The slides were then blocked with 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h, treated with primary antibodies for
1 h, and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or Alexa 568-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Slides were then mounted with ProLong Gold with DAPI
(Invitrogen). Images were captured using an immunofluorescence microscope (BZ-X700an:
Keyence, Osaka, Japan).

Statistical Analysis
The data are presented as mean ± SEM of 3 independent experiments (biological replicates),
each performed in triplicate (technical replicates). The level of significance was determined
using one-way analysis of variance, followed by two-sided Tukey’s multiple range tests
(GraphPad Prism5). Sample size was chosen for statistical power. Differences were
considered statistically significant when p<0.05 (center values are the mean). All
experiments were replicated three times, which were sufficient for statistical analysis. All
error bars refer to s.e.m. For the animal studies (i.e., in vivo transplantation), all data were
included in the analysis – none were excluded. The experimenter was not blinded to the
studies, and the data were not randomized.

CPEB1 regulates migration of mammary epithelial cells. (a) NMuMG cells were infected
with lentiviruses expressing GFP only (control) or GFP plus shRNA against CPEB1
(shCPEB1-1). The relative levels of CPEB1 were determined by RT-PCR; tubulin RNA
served as a control. (b) Proliferation rate of cells infected with control of shCPEB1 in the
absence or presence of FBS. (c) Control and CPEB1-depleted cells were analyzed for cell
motility in a wound-healing scratch assay. The dotted lines define the areas lacking cells.
The histogram displays the ratio of wound healing from time 0h to time 24h by measuring
the area of each scratch closure. (d) NMuMG cells infected with control or CPEB1
knockdown virus were western blotted for ZO-1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Zeb1, and tubulin,
and immunostained for E-cadherin and F-actin. (e) Migration, invasion, and soft-agar colony
formation assays following CPEB1 knockdown. In this and all subsequent figures, one
asterisk refers to p<0.05 and two asterisks refer to p<0.01 (two-sided Tukey’s multiple range
test). All experiments were performed three times (biologic replicates). All histograms in all
figures refer to mean +/− sem. Refer to Materials and Methods for further details. N.D.

CPEB1 suppresses mammary tumor metastasis. (a) Mouse mammary 4T1 cells were
infected with a retrovirus expressing CPEB1 and western blotted for FLAG-CPEB, ZO-1, Ecadherin, and tubulin. (b) Control and ectopic CPEB1-expressing cells cultured in the
absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were examined for cell proliferation.
(c) Control and ectopic CPEB1-expressing cells were examined for motility in a woundhealing scratch assay. The dotted lines define the areas lacking cells. The histogram displays
the ratio of wound healing from time 0h to time 24h by measuring the area of each scratch
closure. (d) Migration, invasion, and soft agar colony formation were assayed cells
harboring ectopically-expressed CPEB1. (e) Control and ectopic CPEB1-expressing 4T1
cells were inoculated into the fat pads of 8 week old female Balb/c mice. Tumor sizes were
measured with calipers along the two main axes and volumes calculated by the long axis x
(short axis)2 × 0.5. (f) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissue after control and
ectopic CPEB1-expressing 4T1 cells were injected into mammary fat pad. (g) Quantification
of metastatic cells in the lung. Three weeks after fat pad inoculation, dissociated lung cells
were cultured with 6-thioguanine; the 4T1 cell metastases were stained with methylene blue
and quantified.

with control or CPEB1 knockdown virus were inoculated into the fat pads of 8 week old
female nude (nu/nu) mice. Calipers were used to measure tumor sizes along the two main
axes. Tumor volumes were estimated by the relationship of the long axis × (short axis)2 ×
0.5. (g) Metastatic MCF-7 cells in the lung were detected by immuno-fluorescence for GFP
in tissue that was snap frozen and sectioned. Quantification of metastatic cells in the lung
was determined by real-time RT-PCR for GFP.
