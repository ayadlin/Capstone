ABSTRACT:
We previously identified SMIP004 (N-(4-butyl-2-methyl-phenyl) acetamide) as
a novel inducer of cancer-cell selective apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.
SMIP004 decreased the levels of positive cell cycle regulators, upregulated cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, and resulted in G1 arrest, inhibition of colony formation
in soft agar, and cell death. However, the mechanism of SMIP004-induced cancer
cell selective apoptosis remained unknown. Here, we used chemical genomic and
proteomic profiling to unravel a SMIP004-induced pro-apoptotic pathway, which
initiates with disruption of mitochondrial respiration leading to oxidative stress. This,
in turn, activates two pathways, one eliciting cell cycle arrest by rapidly targeting
cyclin D1 for proteasomal degradation and driving the transcriptional downregulation
of the androgen receptor, and a second pathway that activates pro-apoptotic signaling
through MAPK activation downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR).
SMIP004 potently inhibits the growth of prostate and breast cancer xenografts in
mice. Our data suggest that SMIP004, by inducing mitochondrial ROS formation,
targets specific sensitivities of prostate cancer cells to redox and bioenergetic
imbalances that can be exploited in cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

understood as results of positive selection of defined driver
mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [3,
4]. In prostate cancer, for example, such genetic drivers
include loss of NKX3.1 and PTEN, amplification of Myc
and the androgen receptor (AR), Sox9 [5], and fusions of
ETS family transcription factors to androgen-inducible
promoters [6]. Therapeutic targeting of driver mutations to
which cancer cells have become ‘addicted’ has proven to
be highly effective, with the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib

Despite the considerable heterogeneity of clinical
tumors [1], malignant transformation confers common
characteristics to cancer cells – hallmarks - which include,
among others, replicative immortality, resistance to
negative growth signals and apoptosis, and the abilities
to induce angiogenesis and to colonize distant organ
sites [2]. Some of these phenotypic properties are now

representing a paradigm. However, many other oncogenic
and tumor suppressive mutations remain difficult to target
pharmacologically. In addition, molecular profiling by
next generation sequencing is continuously adding further
layers of complexity to the genetic make-up of cancer
cells to complicate the development of broadly applicable
targeted therapies [7].
Despite tumor heterogeneity, the expression of
a common set of phenotypic properties, some of which
also mark a common set of liabilities, can be exploited
in therapy. The concept of “non-oncogene addiction” as
introduced by Elledge and colleagues recognizes that
cancer cells also rely on pathways that are not oncogenic
per se but that nonetheless support their survival [8, 9].
Often as a direct result of oncogenic signaling, cancer
cells are exposed to a series of stress conditions that
are not ordinarily experienced by normal cells. This
stress phenotype commands an increased reliance on
rate-limiting stress support systems such as chaperones,
DNA repair mechanisms, and antioxidant functions.
Mechanisms of stress sensitization or stress overload that
interact with the cancer phenotype in a synthetic lethal
manner are consequently considered viable strategies
for therapeutic intervention [9]. In fact, DNA damaging
chemotherapeutics, hyperthermia and proteasome
inhibitors already provide proof-of-principle for this
approach.
The stress environment to which cancer cells are
exposed typically includes a closely intertwined and
mutually reinforcing network of oxidative, genotoxic,
and proteotoxic stresses [9]. For example, intracellular
accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through
oncogenic signaling [10, 11] or as a result of hypoxia
[12], sensitizes cancer cells to oxidative damage to DNA,
proteins, and lipids. The production of ROS during
mitochondrial respiration can be limited by the almost
universally observed reprogramming of cancer cell
metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis [13]. The increased
reliance of cancer cells on glycolysis represents a requisite
example of non-oncogene addiction that permits selective
targeting by small molecules [14, 15].
In a high-content screen for compounds that
upregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
(CKI) p27KIP1, we previously identified N-(4-butyl-2methylphenyl) acetamide (SMIP004) as a novel inducer
of cancer cell-selective apoptosis of LNCaP human
prostate cancer cells [16]. SMIP004 upregulated the CKIs
p27 and p21 while decreasing the levels of positive cell
cycle regulators, such as cyclin A, CDK4 and SKP2. The
compound also suppressed intracellular CDK2 kinase
activity, resulting in G1 arrest and inhibition of colony
formation in soft agar. SMIP004 also induced cancer
cell-selective apoptosis, but its mechanism of action
remained unknown. We show here that SMIP004 has a
novel activity in directing a mitochondrial pathway that
leads to oxidative stress, activation of the unfolded protein

response (UPR), and apoptosis.

RESULTS
SMIP004 Induces the Unfolded Protein Response
To assess global effects of SMIP004 at times
when apoptosis has been initiated and to cross-reference
these effects with those of other cytotoxic compounds,
we obtained transcriptomic profiles of LNCaP-S14
cells exposed to SMIP004, to the DNA damaging agent
camptothecin, to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(BTZ), and to the CDK inhibitor roscovitine for 24 h. Our
LNCaP-S14 cell line, which was generated for the highcontent screen that identified SMIP004, was derived by
stably overexpressing the SKP2 subunit of the CRL1SKP2
ubiquitin ligase in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.
As a result of SKP2 overexpression, LNCaP-S14 cells
exhibited marked downregulation of p27 and a reduced
G1 population but behaved identically to parental LNCaP
cells in terms of cellular responses to SMIP004 [16].
The SMIP004 mRNA expression signature was
most similar to the signature induced by BTZ with a
~50% overlap in mRNAs changing more than 2-fold (p ≤
0.05) (Fig. 1A) even though SMIP004 is not a proteasome
inhibitor [16]. Network and pathway analyses revealed
a general upregulation of stress and apoptotic pathways,
including those involved in stress kinase, oxidative stress,
death receptor and p53 signaling, and the ubiquitinproteasome system (Fig. 1B, C). In addition, pathways
involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) were strongly induced (Fig. 1B). This also
included components of the ER stress-induced unfolded
protein response (UPR) [17] such as IRE1, ATF6, and
XBP1, and their transcriptional downstream targets (Fig.
1D). These findings suggested that SMIP004, like BTZ
[18], acted as an UPR inducer.
SMIP004 caused rapid dose-dependent activation of
all three arms of the UPR as indicated by phosphorylation
of eIF2α (3 h) and upregulation of CHOP (6 h), IRE1 (9 h),
and BIP (12 h) (Fig. 2A, B). Splicing of transcription factor
XBP1 mRNA was induced at SMIP004 concentrations as
low as 1 µM and as rapidly as 15 min after treatment (Fig.
2C, D). UPR induction was also observed in other prostate
cancer cell lines, but not in normal human fibroblasts
which do not die in response to SMIP004 (Fig. S1; [16]).
Prolonged ER stress can trigger two major proapoptotic pathways [19, 20]. Activated IRE1 promotes a
cascade of phosphorylation events that culminates in the
activation of JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase the sustained activation
of which leads to cell death [21, 22]. Secondly, CHOP
transcriptionally induces various pro-apoptotic factors
[20]. We found that SMIP004 induced JNK and p38
activity (Fig. 2E, F), whereas chemical inhibitors of these
1213

kinases partially antagonized SMIP004-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 2E - G). In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
IRE1 and CHOP rescued cell death induced by SMIP004
(Fig. 2H, see Fig. S1B for knockdown efficiencies). Thus,
UPR signaling is the primary trigger of SMIP004-induced
cancer cell apoptosis.

eIF2α [25, 26]. Downregulation of CHOP or p27 did not
affect SMIP004-induced G1 arrest thus ruling out these
pathways ([16] and data not shown). The transcriptomic
analysis revealed marked downregulation of the RB tumor
suppressor pathway (Fig. 1B) with major players such as
cyclin D1, CDK4, and E2F mRNAs strongly suppressed
(Fig. 3A). Consistently, cyclin D1/CDK4-mediated
phosphorylation of RB on serine 780 was diminished in a
dose-dependent manner beginning at 2 h after compound
administration (Fig. 3B). This effect was closely paralleled
by the rapid (~ 1h) downregulation and nuclear depletion
of cyclin D1 protein (Fig. S2), whereas CDK4 levels
only declined at later times (Fig. 3B). However, the
inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation by siRNA-mediated
knockdown of PERK did not prevent SMIP004-mediated
cyclin D1 downregulation (Fig. 3C), thereby implicating a
mechanism that is distinct from those previously described
[25–27].
Indeed, rapid cyclin D1 downregulation involved

SMIP004 Induces Destruction of Cyclin D1 via
the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway
Before inducing apoptosis, SMIP004 arrests cellcycle progression in G1 phase [16], but the mechanism
of this arrest remained unidentified. Several ER stressinduced pathways have been implicated in G1 arrest,
including those involving CHOP-dependent transcription
[23], p27 accumulation through suppression of SKP2mediated ubiquitylation [24], and inhibition of cyclin D1

cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) [28] in cyclin
D1 ubiquitylation, the NEDD8 E1 enzyme inhibitor
MLN4924, which inactivate CRLs [29], substantially

rescue cyclin D1 degradation (data not shown), suggesting
that SMIP004 can direct cyclin D1 degradation through
multiple redundant pathways.

by overexpressing cyclin D1 and CDK4. Overexpression
of both cyclin D1 and CDK4 in untreated cells reduced the
fraction of cells in G1 and increased the S phase fraction,
indicating that their overexpression promoted G1-S
progression (Fig. 3F). This combination also substantially
rescued the inhibition of RB phosphorylation resulting

from treatment of cells with SMIP004. Nevertheless, cell
cycle arrest was not overcome by cyclin D1 and CDK4
overexpression even though the proteins were restored to
levels considerably higher than those found in untreated
cells (Fig. 3F). Apparently, in addition to cyclin D1/CDK4
downregulation, SMIP004 inhibits cell cycle progression

through other mechanisms. We had previously shown
that SMIP004 upregulates the CDK inhibitors p21 and
p27, which might restrain the CDK activity required for
cell-cycle progression downstream of RB [16]. Indeed,
knockdown of p21 and p27 in cells overexpressing cyclin
D1 and CDK4 partially prevented SMIP004-induced
downregulation of the S phase population, suggesting
that SMIP004 robustly impacts cell cycle progression at
multiple levels.

with several major AR target genes being strongly
downregulated (e.g. KLK2, KLK3/PSA, HOXB13,
NKX3-1; Fig. 4A). Due to the seminal importance of
AR signaling in prostate cancer which is maintained
even after it has progressed to the castration resistant
state [30], we sought a deeper understanding of the
antiandrogenic activity of SMIP004. The compound
induced downregulation of the AR protein in a manner
that closely paralleled UPR induction in terms of timing
and dose dependence as determined by BIP accumulation
(Fig. 4B). SMIP004-induced AR downregulation
was functionally consequential because it drastically
suppressed the secretion of PSA (Fig. 4C).
UPR signaling induced by the SERCA inhibitor
thapsigargin was previously shown to inhibit the
synthesis of the AR protein, possible due to inhibitory

phosphorylation of eIF2α [31]. However, siRNAmediated knockdown of PERK, IRE1, or CHOP did not
impair SMIP004-mediated AR downregulation (Fig. 4D),
suggesting that it occurs in a UPR-independent manner.
Induced proteolysis via ubiquitin-proteasome system is a
major mode of AR downregulation by HSP90 inhibitors
[32, 33] and AhR agonists [34]. In contrast, SMIP004induced AR downregulation was not abrogated by the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 either in LNCaP-S14 or
parental LNCaP cells or in another AR positive prostate
cancer cell line, 22RV1 (Fig. 4E). Instead, RT-PCR
analysis indicated that SMIP004 downregulated AR
mRNA (Fig. 4F). Since AR mRNA stability was only
modestly affected by SMIP004 (t1/2 = 9.76 h; Fig. 4G)
versus DMSO (t1/2 = 13.3 h), we performed reporter
gene assays to determine the impact of SMIP004
on AR promoter activity. AR promoter activity was
repressed by SMIP004 in a dose-dependent manner

To gain insight into proximal mechanisms
determining the pleiotropic cellular activities of SMIP004,
we performed a SILAC experiment [35] to obtain a
quantitative proteomic profile of the response of prostate
cancer cells to short-term exposure to SMIP004 (3h).
Whereas the vast majority of the ~4500 proteins measured
retained a log2 ratio very close to 0 in SMIP004 treated
versus untreated cells (Fig.5A, Supplementary Data File

1), SMIP004 induced the upregulation of 580 proteins and
the downregulation of 168 proteins (1.2-fold, p ≤ 0.05).
Network analysis revealed induction of biosynthetic
pathways by SMIP004, which included mRNA splicing,
export and translation, protein processing in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and vesicular transport (Fig.
5B, Fig. S3A). SMIP004 also upregulated 110 proteins
belonging to the Gene Ontology terms Mitochondrial
Matrix and Mitochondrial Membrane. Of these, 36 are
directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including
members of the electron transport chain (ETC), ATP
synthase, and several mitochondrial carriers of the SLC25
family (Fig. 5A, C).
The proteomic profile suggested that SMIP004
altered mitochondrial activity, potentially increasing the
flux through the respiration chain. Surprisingly, we found
that SMIP004 led to a rapid and pronounced reduction
in basal and maximal (uncoupled) mitochondrial oxygen
consumption (Fig. 5D, E; Fig. S3B). The compound also
reduced the cellular ATP derived from mitochondria,

A

although levels rebounded after 1 – 2 h (Fig 5F, Fig. S3C).
Since ETC inhibition is a well-known mechanism of
mitochondrial ROS formation [36, 37], we asked whether
SMIP004 caused oxidative stress. Indeed, SMIP004 led
to increased mitochondrial ROS formation beginning
as early as 30 minutes (Fig. 5G, Fig. S3D). In addition,
the compound caused a decrease in the ratio of reduced
to oxidized glutathione (Fig 5H) and a time-dependent
increase in the expression of hemeoxygenase 1 (HMOX1)
mRNA (Fig 5I), a prominent target of the oxidative
stress-inducible transcription factor NRF2 [38]. Finally,
SMIP004 led to a mild reduction in the mitochondrial
membrane potential (Fig. 5J), a finding that is consistent
with the local toxicity of increased ROS production [39].
Consistent with the above results, a screen for
chemical compounds able to antagonize the cytotoxic
activity of SMIP004 identified the ROS scavengers
butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and trolox, which
potently rescued cells from SMIP004-induced apoptotic
cell death (Fig. 6A, B, S4). BHA and trolox also abrogated

and its analog SMIP004-7 are shown in the top panel. The middle panel shows the effect of several SMIP004 analogs on UPR activation
and cell cycle regulators. LNCaP-S14 cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%), SMIP004 (40 µM), SMIP004-7 (40 µM), or the inactive

all other cellular effects of SMIP004, including UPR
induction (Fig. 6C), inhibition of RB phosphorylation
and cyclin D1 proteolysis (Fig. 6D), and transcriptional
downregulation of the AR (Fig. 6E). These findings place
SMIP004-induced oxidative stress on top of a cascade that
culminates in cell cycle arrest and cancer cell selective
apoptosis (Fig. 6F and Discussion).

results were confirmed by final average tumor weights
and by individual changes in tumor volumes, whereas no
significant weight loss was observed (Fig. S5C - E). These
data firmly suggest that pretreated animals bore growth
competent tumors and that the observed tumor inhibition
is thus due to the pharmacological activity of SMIP004-7.
To further validate the anti-tumor activity of
SMIP004-7, we performed further xenograft studies
using an additional AR-positive human prostate cancer
cell line, LAPC4. SMIP004-7 elicited the same effects
on LAPC4 as on LNCaP-S14 cells in terms of growth
inhibition, downregulation of RB phosphorylation and
AR expression, and UPR activation (Fig. S5F), but was
~5 times more potent than the parent compound SMIP004
in inducing cell death (IC50 = 0.68 vs. 3.53 µM, Fig. S5G).
Animals with similar initial LAPC4 tumor burden were
paired and assigned to either the drug or vehicle cohort.
SMIP004-7 exhibited profound tumor inhibitory activity
in this system with 5 out of 6 animals displaying lower
tumor volumes upon treatment for 7 days (Fig. S5H).
Lastly, we found that SMIP004-7 tumor inhibitory
activity was also observed in the MDA MB-231 breast
cancer xenograft model. Treatment with SMIP004-7
for three weeks inhibited tumor growth ~5-fold without
any changes in body weight (Fig. S5I), suggesting that
SMIP004-7 may have broader anti-cancer activity.

SMIP004 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Cell Growth
in Vivo
Given its robust modulation of several cellular
pathways that are highly relevant to prostate cancer such
as AR signaling and the cyclin D1/CDK4/RB axis [40],
we tested whether SMIP004 exhibited anti-prostate cancer
activity in murine xenograft models. For these studies, we
used the more potent analog SMIP004-7 (Fig. 7A). The
analog evoked identical cellular pathways as the parental
compound but had a twofold lower IC50 (620 nM, Fig.
7A). We first determined the maximally tolerated dose of
SMIP004-7 (~200 mg/kg intraperitonially, i.p.; data not
shown). SCID mice bearing LNCaP-S14 tumors were
dosed with 50 mg/kg i.p. daily. SMIP004-7 potently
suppressed tumor growth as judged by average tumor
volumes (Fig. 7B). The final tumor weights were ~40%
lower in SMIP004-7 treated animals (average 340 ± 70
mm3, 0.10 ± 0.03g, Fig. 7C) compared to those of the
vehicle control group (average 570 ± 61 mm3, 0.17 ±
0.03 g; Fig. 7C). SMIP004-7 completely inhibited tumor
growth in three of six animals (#1, 2 and 3) and greatly
retarded tumor growth in the remaining three mice,
while vehicle control mice showed an increase in tumor
volume of at least 250 mm3 (Fig. 7D). Only insignificant
weight loss was observed (Fig. 7E). Blood chemistry and
histology of major organs (heart, lung, spleen, pancreas,
gut and skeletal muscle), were largely normal at the end of
the treatment period (Table S1). Occasional splenomegaly
was, however, observed (data not shown). In addition,
some hepatocytes of treated mice displayed increased
nuclear size and multinucleation (Fig. S5A). These
phenotypes resemble those of SKP2-/- knockout animals
[41], and the finding is therefore consistent with the
known activity of SMIP004 to downregulate SKP2 [16].
To rule out that the reduction in tumor growth was
due to events other than the administration of SMIP004-7,
we suspended compound treatment of 3 mice for 17 days.
During the suspension period, the residual tumors resumed
growth indicating that the cells originally received by these
animals were competent of forming tumors. When tumors
reached ~500 mm3, the pretreated animals were subjected
to a second round of treatment with an increased dose of
SMIP007-4 (100 mg/kg daily) for 10 days. As in the first
treatment period, SMIP004-7 receiving animals showed
a strong inhibition in tumor growth whereas tumors grew
to large sizes in vehicle treated mice (Fig. S5B). These

DISCUSSION
Mechanisms of SMIP004-Directed Cell Cycle
Arrest and Apoptosis
Our combined chemical genomic and proteomic
profiling followed by functional validation of predicted
pathways revealed a first model for the mechanism of
action of SMIP004 (Fig. 6F). According to this scheme,
SMIP004 induces oxidative stress, which then triggers
independent pathways that drive cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis.
Proteolytic downregulation of cyclin D1 likely
initiates the cell cycle arrest because it commences within
~2 hours after SMIP004 addition. Proteolysis involves the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and members of the CRL
family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, although the exact identity
of the E3(s) remains to be established. Regardless, the
SMIP004-induced proteolytic mechanism is very potent
as it clears a large portion of cyclin D1, even when it is
strongly overexpressed (Fig. 3F). The compound might
therefore be particularly effective against the abundant
class of malignancies driven by high levels of cyclin D1
[42]. Suppression of cyclin D1/CDK4 activity would result
in reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F transcription
factor activity [43]. As a result, E2F target genes such
as SKP2 will be suppressed [44], a prediction we have
1221

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 1212-1229

confirmed previously [16]. The downregulation of SKP2
would then stabilize p21 and p27 to reinforce the G1 cell
cycle arrest.
Like cyclin D1, AR is downregulated by SMIP004,
albeit with slower kinetics and through a distinct
mechanism involving transcriptional repression. E2F1
is a direct activator of the AR promoter, and loss of RB
is associated with increased AR levels and progression
of prostate cancers to castration resistance [40]. The
suppressive effects of SMIP004 on the cyclin D1/RB/
E2F pathway may therefore underlie transcriptional
AR downregulation (Fig. 6F). Irrespective of the exact
mechanism, SMIP004-induced AR downregulation is
significant for advanced prostate cancer, which typically
maintains dependence on the AR protein even after
progression to castration resistance [30]. Whereas AR
downregulation may augment SMIP004-induced cell
death, we do not regard it as a primary trigger because of
its delayed onset (12 - 24 h).
Rather, based on kinetics, siRNA, and chemical
inhibitor studies, UPR signaling resulting in MAPK
activation was identified as the primary pathway
executing SMIP004-induced cancer cell apoptosis. UPR
signaling is principally geared towards cell survival but
induces apoptosis upon severe insult [19]. Many human
cancers display a chronically induced UPR, potentially as
adaptation to microenvironmental stresses [45]. However,
with regards to the well recognized “stress phenotype”
of cancer cells [9], such a survival strategy can turn
maladaptive when confronted with therapeutic regimens
that exhaust the stress support network. We propose that
SMIP004 is such a regimen, and that the cancer cell
selectivity of the compound derives from the differential
sensitivity to proapoptotic UPR signaling.

localized in the nucleus and thus activated in untreated
LNCaP-S14 cells (Fig. S3E). While SMIP004 caused an
additional activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program
geared toward stress defense (GCLM, X-C system,
NQO, TRXR1, HMOX1, Supplementary Data File 2),
compound exposed cells could no longer capitalize on the
pro-survival function of this program [46]. This may be
due to paradoxical SMIP004-mediated downregulation
of prominent NRF2 target genes involved in glutathione
utilization and regeneration (GLRX, GSR, GPX1, 2, 4,
most glutathione-S-transferases, Supplementary Data File
2). Whereas it remains unclear how SMIP004 promotes
the selective activation of NRF2 target genes, this
imbalance may contribute to the observed decrease in the
GSH-GSSG ratio and the lethal consequences of oxidative
stress.
The mechanism of ROS-induced apoptosis are
not well understood [47] but UPR induction is a known
consequence of oxidative stress [48]. ROS can cause
protein misfolding in the ER through oxidation of amino
acids or by perturbing calcium-dependent ER chaperone
activity. Conversely, ER stress can trigger oxidative
stress through CHOP-mediated induction of ERO1-like
enzymes, which release H2O2 during protein disulfide
isomerase-catalyzed formation of disulfide bonds. ERO1LB mRNA was upregulated ~3.5-fold by SMIP004. Since
the ER is a highly oxidizing environment, it is particularly
susceptible to oxidative stress and the vicious cycle
resulting from it. Cancer cells originating from secretory
tissues with high traffic through the ER, such as prostate
epithelial cells, are expected to be preferentially sensitive
to such conditions.

Potential Utility of Disruptors of Mitochondrial
Redox Balance for Cancer Therapy

Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress as a Proximal
Element of the Mechanism of Action of SMIP004

Insights gained over the past 15 years have
put the concept of pharmacological targeting of the
increased oxidative stress sensitivity of cancer cells on
a firm foundation [9, 47, 49, 50]. Several high profile
compounds, including erastin [51], piperlongumine [52],
and elesclomol [53] have emerged, which cause ROSdependent cell death selectively in cancer cells. While
mechanisms and targets vary, some of these compounds
are already being tested in the clinic.
The molecular target(s) of SMIP004 remain to
be identified. Based on the instant kinetics with which
the compound inhibits mitochondrial ATP production
and stimulates mitochondrial ROS (5 – 30 minutes),
it is tempting to speculate that SMIP004 directly
interferes with the ETC. SMIP004 may therefore have
a similar mechanism of action as the chelating agent
elesclomol. This compound does not appear to have a
protein target per se but rather to interfere more broadly
with the mitochondrial electron transport process

Several lines of evidence indicate that SMIP004
directly induced a pathway leading to oxidative stress:
(i.) The compound increased mitochondrial ROS within
15 minutes. (ii.) All cellular effects of SMIP004 were
rescued by two different antioxidants. (iii.) SMIP004
caused a rapid decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio. (iv.) The
compound led to induction of the NRF2 transcriptional
pathway, in particular the mRNA for HMOX1 (Fig. 5G).
Notably, a relatively small increase in mitochondrial
ROS (~40%) led to a dramatic decrease in cell viability.
This finding highlights the low tolerance of cancer
cells for extraneous stressors, presumably because their
endogenous stress defense mechanisms are already
stretched to the limits. Consistently, we noticed that
LNCaP-S14 cells display very high basal levels of ROS
relative to primary human fibroblasts (data not shown).
Presumably as an adaptive measure, NRF2 is already

1222

through copper-dependent redox cycling [54]. The
coordinated upregulation of ETC components observed
in our proteomic profile (3 h) may therefore reflect a
compensatory but ultimately futile effort of SMIP004
exposed cells to uphold electron transport. Interestingly,
a yeast screen for elesclomol sensitive heterozygous
diploids identified a network of mitochondrial and protein
anabolic processes that largely overlapped with that we
obtained through proteomic profiling [54].
In the era of “targeted therapy” and “personalized
health care”, there remain questions as to the viability
of pleiotropic stress response pathways as cancer drug
targets. The following points may be considered: (i.) Many
clinically efficacious cancer drugs, including bortezomib,
cisplatin, and etoposide, rely on ROS formation for
efficacy [47, 49]. (ii.) Just like redox disruptors, a
surprising number of “targeted” drugs in advanced stages
of clinical testing, including proteasome, MAPK, and
mTOR inhibitors, target molecules that are essential to the
survival of normal cells and thus not per se cancer cell
selective. Here, cancer selectivity appears to come from
the phenomenon of non-oncogene addiction [9]. (iii.)
Redox active therapeutics are not necessarily incompatible
with the emerging concept of personalized medicine. To
the contrary, they stand to benefit from the development
of biomarkers just as much as any other form of therapy.
In the future, detailed redox pheno- and genotyping could
guide the selection of speciﬁc drugs such as SMIP004
that efﬁciently target the redox vulnerability of individual
cancers.

high glucose (4.5 mg/ml). LAPC4 cells were maintained
in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Media (IMDM). Cells
were grown as a monolayer in a humidified incubator
at 37°C and 5% CO2. For experiments with LNCaP-S14
cells, cells were plated in poly-lysine coated plates one
day before treatments. Cell viability was assessed using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay (ATCC®). Cell
cycle analysis was done by flow cytometry as described
previously [16] at the Flow Cytometry Facility of the
Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute. Apoptosis
was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA
(Roche) and by immunoblotting for PARP cleavage.

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (GEO Series
Accession Number GSE48056).
The averaged expression data for ~15,000 mRNAs
for each drug treatment (Supplementary Data File 2) were
hierarchically clustered (Spearman Rank Correlation,
Complete Linkage Clustering). Pathway analysis was
performed using Ingenuity IPA software. A list of 2333
mRNAs that were significantly regulated (≥ 2-fold, p ≤
0.05) by SMIP004 (Supplementary Data File 3) was
imported into IPA and canonical pathways enriched in the
dataset were identified. A list of pathways related to stress
response, cell cycle, and cancer was selected manually and
displayed in the Figure 1.
Network analysis was performed with the Cytoscape
Reactome FI plugin [56]. Individual lists of SMIP004induced and SMIP004-repressed mRNAs (±2-fold, p
≤ 0.05, derived from Supplementary Data File 3) were
loaded into Cytoscape and used to build Reactome
networks. The networks were clustered into modules, and
pathways enriched in the modules (FDR ≤ 0.01) were
identified (Fig. 1B).

Immunofluorescence

Total lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting
as described previously [16]. Films were scanned
and quantification of the bands was performed using
ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). For
immunofluorescence staining, LNCaP-S14 cells were
seeded onto 15 mm poly-lysine coated glass cover slips,
treated with compounds, and fixed using formaldehyde
(3.7% in PBS). Samples were stained with anti-cyclin D1
antibody and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst
dye. Samples were imaged on a Nikon Type 120 inverted
fluorescent microscope using 60X magnification.

Quantitative Proteomic Profiling by Stable
Isotope Labeling (SILAC)
LNCaP-S14 cells were metabolically labeled with
the heavy amino acids 13C6 L-lysine and C615N4-L-arginine
(SILAC Metabolic Label, Thermo Scientific) for a period
of 6 weeks. “Light” cells maintained in standard media
were treated with SMIP004 (40 μM) for 3h, whereas
“heavy” cells received vehicle (DMSO, 0.1%). Cells were
lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH7.4, 0.55%
CHAPS, 7.7 M urea, 2.2 M thiourea, 200 mM DTT, 5 µg/
ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 1
mM PMSF. The lysate was rotated 30 minutes at room
temperature, and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm
for 15 minutes. Protein concentration was determined
by Bradford assay. Cell lysates were mixed at an exact
ratio of 1:1. 1.5 mg of mixed lysate was precipitated with
methanol and chloroform, and the pellet was dried at room
temperature.
SILAC labeled LNCaP-S14 cell lysate pellets were
re-suspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and
processed as described before [57]. Briefly, proteins were
reduced by TCEP, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and
digested by trypsin overnight at 37oC. The peptides were
then desalted using Sep-Pak (Millipore), and separated by
strong cation chromatography (SCX) using an automated
Paradigm HPLC instrument (Michrom Bioresources ). The
SCX gradient proceeded from 5% - 40% buffer D (25%
acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid/ 500 mM KCl), and 24 SCX
fractions were collected. Each SCX fraction was analyzed
by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS on a Magic C18 column
and a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). The peptides in each SCX fraction were

Microarray Analysis
Total RNA from cells treated with 40 µM SMIP004,
vehicle or positive controls for 24h was obtained
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was assessed
using a Bioanalyzer (Bio-Rad Experion), and microarray
analysis was performed at the Microarray Facility
(Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute) on the
Illumina platform. Briefly, labeled cRNA was generated
from total RNA utilizing an RNA amplification kit
developed for Illumina (Ambion). First-strand cDNA was
synthesized after priming with a T7 promoter-oligo(dT)
primer, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis in the
presence of biotin-16-UTP. The amplified, biotinylated
cRNA was labeled by incubation with streptavidinCy3. Hybridization was conducted on the HumanRef-8
v2 Expression BeadChip (Illumina cassettes), which
contain ~23,000 human transcript probes and controls.
Standard hybridization and wash protocols were used
as recommended by the manufacturer. Following highresolution scanning of the array slides, the BeadStation
software was used to deconvolute and present the data in a
MIAME compatible tabular form. Several control features
are built into the arrays for normalization and quality
control. Microarray data has been deposited to NCBI’s

separated on a 60-120 min gradient of 8%-30% buffer
B (100% acetonitrile/ 0.1% formic acid). Tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra were collected during the
LC/MS runs. Each scan was set to acquire a full MS scan,
followed by MS/MS scans on the top four precursor ions
from the preceding MS scan. The LC-MS/MS analysis of
the 24 fractions was repeated 3 times for each biological
sample.
Both the protein identification and the SILAC
quantification were performed by Integrated Proteomics
Pipeline (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Application Inc)
which includes SEQUEST, ProLuCID, DTASelect, and
Census (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).
First, MS1 and MS2 files were extracted by RawExtract
(The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) from the
raw MS/MS spectra obtained on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL.
Then an IPI human database was uploaded into IP2, which
automatically generated a reverse protein database. The
MS1 and MS2 files of each technical replicates were
combined and searched using ProLuCID and the semitryptic decoy database. Modifications included 16 Da
on methionine for oxidation, 6 Da on lysine and 10 Da
on arginine for heavy SILAC labels. The identification
results from ProLuCID were filtered and organized by
DTASelect. The DTASelect parameters were set so that
the false positive rates on the protein level were below
1.2%. The false positive rates on the peptide level were <
0.2%. Finally, protein ratios (light/heavy) and the standard
deviation were calculated by Census. As expected, the
vast majority of proteins showed a ratio very close to
1.0 in the SMIP004-treated versus DMSO-treated cells
(Fig. 5A) thus documenting the accuracy of the protein
quantification.
Network analysis was performed with the Cytoscape
Reactome FI plugin [56]. A list of 580 SMIP004-induced
proteins (1.2-fold, p ≤ 0.05) was loaded and used to build
a Reactome network, which contained 237 nodes and
1318 edges. The network was clustered into modules,
and pathways enriched in the modules (FDR ≤ 0.01) were
identified (Supp Fig. 3A).

lysate was measured on a Veritas microplate luminometer
(Turner Biosystems) and normalized to the β-gal activity.
Plasmids for cyclin D1 (12 μg) and/or CDK4 (12
μg) were transiently transfected into 2 x 106 LNCaP-S14
cells using Lipofectamine 2000. SMIP004 was added
24h after transfection for an additional 24h. Cells were
collected for determination of cell cycle distribution by
FACS and for immunoblotting analysis.

Small Interfering (siRNA) Transfection
LNCaP-S14 cells (0.625 x 106 cells) were plated
one day prior to transfection. 10-20 nM of siRNA was
transfected using DharmaFECT 3 (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
siRNAs were added to the DharmaFECT 3 reagent prediluted in OptiMEM media (1:100) and incubated for
15 min at room temperature. The mixture was added
to the cells followed by incubation for 48h. Treatment
with SMIP004 or vehicle was carried out for 24h. Cell
lysate was obtained and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Un-transfected cells as well as cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA were used as controls. siRNAs targeting
PERK (siGENOME SMART pool M-004883-03-0005)
and IRE1 (siGENOME SMART pool M-00495102-0005) were purchased from Thermo Scientific.
siRNAs targeting CHOP were ordered from Integrated
DNA Technologies and had the following sequence:
CUCUGUUUCCGUUUCCUGGtt [59]. p27 and p21
siRNAs were as described in [16]. Silencer® Negative
Control siRNA #1 from Ambion was used as control
siRNA.

AR mRNA Stability Measurement by Q-PCR
LNCaP-S14 cells were treated with SMIP004 (40
µM) for 9 h followed by addition of actinomycin D (5 µg/
ml). Cells were harvested at different time intervals (0, 0.5,
1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24h). Total RNA was isolated, followed
by first-strand cDNA synthesis using Omniscript® Reverse
Transcription kit (Quiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR
was performed on the Stratagene Mx3000p detection
system (Stratagene, Agilent, CA. USA) using the Brilliant
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies). All
reactions were done in duplicates.

Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay
An AR-luc construct driving the expression of
luciferase under the control of the -5400 to +580 region of
the androgen receptor promoter [58] was transiently cotransfected with β-gal expression plasmid into LNCaP-S14
cells. Briefly, 1 x 105 LNCaP-S14 cells were seeded in
12 well plates and transfected with 1.6 µg plasmid/well
using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Six hours after transfection, the medium was
changed and the cells were allowed to grow for 24h
followed by treatment with SMIP004 or vehicle (DMSO)
for another 24h in the presence or absence of R1881
(0.2 nM). Cells were lysed with 150 μl of CCLR reagent
(Promega). The chemiluminescence activity in 50 μl of

PSA Quantitative Determination
LNCaP-S14 cells were plated one day prior to
the addition of vehicle, SMIP004 or R1881. Media
was collected 24 and 48h after, and PSA secretion was
determined using a Human PSA ELISA Kit (Anogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Metabolic Measurements

Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species in the
Mitochondria

For determination of ATP levels, LNCaP-S14 cells
were plated in 96 well plates one day prior to addition
of SMIP004 (40 µM) in the presence or absence of 10
mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). ATP levels were measured
using the ApoSENSORTM ATP Assay Kit (BioVision). For
determination of the GSH/GSSG ratio, LNCaP-S14 cells
were treated with SMIP004 (40 µM) for 6h followed by
lysis and GSH/GSSG determination using the Glutathione
Assay Kit (BioVision).

Mitochondrial superoxide production was evaluated
using MitoSoxTM Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator
(Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with some modifications. 3 x 105 cells were
seeded into 6 well-plates and allowed to attach for 24h,
followed by treatment with SMIP004 (40 μM) for 15,
30, 60 minutes or 3h. Cells were stained with MitoSox
(5 µM) for 10 min at 37°C followed by one wash in
HBSS buffer. Cells were detached with trypsin and
pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 10 min. The
pellet was suspended in 300 μl formaldehyde (3.7%) and
incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed
by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 10 min. The pellet
was suspended in 250 μl HBSS and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Measurements were carried out using FACSort
and FACSCanto flow cytometers at the Flow Cytometer
Facility of the Sanford Burnham Medical Research
Institute. MitoSox Red was excited at 488 nm, and data
was collected in the 564-606 nm channel.

Measurement of Oxygen Consumption
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured
in real-time, in an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA). LNCaP-S14 cells
were seeded in XF24-well plates (50000 cells per well
in 100 μl). After 6 h, 500 μl media was added followed
by incubation overnight at 37 oC, 5% CO2. The XF24
sensor cartridge was hydrated with 1 ml calibration buffer
per well overnight at 37oC. The sensor cartridge was
loaded with assay media (ports A, B and C) to measure
basal OCR or with oligomycin (1 μM, port A), carbonyl
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.5
μM, port B) and rotenone (1 μM, port C) to measure the
bioenergetic profile. Cells were washed once with prewarmed serum-free unbuffered assay medium containing
10 mM sodium pyruvate and 25 mM glucose. 500μl/well
of assay medium containing DMSO or SMIP004 (40 μM)
was added for measurement of basal OCR. To measure the
bioenergetic profile, cells were pre-incubated with DMSO
or SMIP004 in regular media for 30, 60 or 120 minutes
followed by one wash with assay medium. Cells were
kept in 500 μl/well of assay medium containing DMSO
or SMIP004 (40 μM) thus preserving pre-incubation drug
concentrations. Once the sensor cartridge was equilibrated,
the calibration plate was replaced with the assay plate.
To determine basal OCR and the bioenergetic profile, 12
measurements were taken every 8 minutes.

LNCaP-S14 Xenograft Studies
Animal experiments were performed in accordance
with the institutional animal care committee (IACUC)
approved by Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute,
La Jolla. CA. Twelve SCID bg mice (8-10 weeks old)
were procured from Harlan Laboratories, Inc., housed
under pathogen-free conditions, and maintained on a 12
h light/12 h dark cycle, with food and water supplied
ad libidum. LNCaP-S14 cells (5 x 106 cells as a 50%
suspension in Matrigel, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in
a final volume of 0.4 ml were injected subcutaneously in
the flank region of the animals. Tumor size was measured
every day until it reached ~ 300 mm3. Mice were then
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle (six mice,
control group) or SMIP004-7 (50 mg/kg) daily (six mice,
treated group) for 10 days. Body weights and tumor
sizes were measured every other day. Tumor volume was
calculated using the equation: volume = length × width ×
depth × 0.5236 mm3. At day 10, three animals per group
were sacrificed and tumors were excised and weighed. The
remaining six animals (3 control and 3 treated) stayed off
treatment for 17 days and were then treated again with
vehicle (control) or SMIP004-7 at 100 mg/kg (treated
group) for 10 days. At the end of the experiment, animals
were sacrificed, tumors weighed, and hematology and
blood chemistry analysis were done.

Membrane

LNCaP-S14 cells treated with SMIP004 were
labeled using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
(TMRE, 300 nM) in warm PBS for 30 min followed by
trypsinization and two washes with warm PBS containing
TMRE (150 nM). Cells were filtered to single suspension
and analyzed by flow cytometry using CellQuest (BD
Biosciences) and FlowJo (Treestar) software. Cells
exposed to the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, 50 µM) for 45 min
were used as positive control.
