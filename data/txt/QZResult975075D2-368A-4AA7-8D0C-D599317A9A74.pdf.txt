Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) dysfunction is associated with a variety of human diseases,
including cancer. Our previous study showed that miR-671-5p was deregulated
throughout breast cancer progression. Here, we report for the first time that
miR- 671- 5p is a tumor-suppressor miRNA in breast tumorigenesis. We found that
expression of miR-671-5p was decreased significantly in invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC) compared to normal in microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissues. Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1), an oncogenic transcription factor,
was predicted as one of the direct targets of miR-671-5p, which was subsequently
confirmed by luciferase assays. Forced expression of miR-671-5p in breast cancer
cell lines downregulated FOXM1 expression, and attenuated the proliferation and
invasion in breast cancer cell lines. Notably, overexpression of miR-671-5p resulted in
a shift from epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition (MET) phenotypes in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and induced S-phase
arrest. Moreover, miR-671-5p sensitized breast cancer cells to cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) and epirubicin exposure. Host cell reactivation (HCR) assays showed that
miR- 671-5p reduces DNA repair capability in post-drug exposed breast cancer cells.
cDNA microarray data revealed that differentially expressed genes when miR-671- 5p
was transfected are associated with cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, and EMT.
These data indicate that miR-671-5p functions as a tumor suppressor miRNA in
breast cancer by directly targeting FOXM1. Hence, miR-671-5p may serve as a novel
therapeutic target for breast cancer management.

Introduction

(miRNAs) are a class of evolutionary conserved, noncoding RNAs, 18–25 nucleotides in length, that regulate
gene expression by annealing to their complementary sites
on coding sequences (CDS) or 3′ untranslated regions
(UTRs) of target genes [2]. Due to their stability and size,
miRNAs can be readily extracted from Formalin-Fixed,

The human genome is composed of approximately
1.5% protein-coding genes, with the rest being non-coding
[1]. Biological functions of the non-coding genome have
been widely investigated in recent years. microRNAs

Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples [3], or circulating
blood as stable biomarkers for cancer detection. miRNAbased anticancer therapies have recently been explored,
either alone or in combination with current targeted
therapies [4]. miRNAs could serve as novel diagnostic
and prognostic candidates, as well as potential therapeutic
targets. For example, we recently reported that miR638 may serve as a potential novel microRNA for triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment [5]. Deregulated
miRNA expression profiles were identified in many human
cancers [6] including breast cancer [7].
The commonly accepted model of human breast
cancer proposes a linear multistep process which initiates
as flat epithelial atypia (FEA), progresses to atypical
ductal hyperplasia (ADH), evolves into ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS), and culminates in the potentially lethal
stage of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) [8]. This linear
model of breast cancer progression has been the rationale
for detection methods such as mammography in hopes of
diagnosing and treating breast cancer at earlier clinical
stages [9]. Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment results
are currently heavily dependent on timeframe of detection
and responsiveness to chemical treatment. Recent studies
have shown that miRNAs could be important in breast
cancer early detection as they become aberrantly expressed
during tumorigenesis. Some miRNAs exhibit distinct
functions in TNBC as compared to non-TNBC tumors.
TNBC is known as ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER- 2
negative subtype of breast cancer, which is insensitive to
some of the most effective therapies available for breast
cancer treatment including HER2 and endocrine therapies.
Our previous study compared miRNA expression
profiles in archived microdissected FFPE components, such
as normal, ADH, DCIS, and IDC, within the same tumor
sample [3]. We found that one of the miRNAs, miR-671-5p,
was consistently down-regulated in ADH and IDC compared
to normal [3]. miR-671-5p dysfunction is associated with
a few human cancers [10], but there is no report in breast
cancer. Here, we identified miR-671- 5p as a tumor-suppressor
miRNA by targeting Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1), an
oncogenic transcription factor, in breast tumorigenesis.

was present in 21 of 30 (70%) IDCs compared with their
adjacent tissues (p < 0.05), which includes 8 of 10 TNBCs
(80%) and 11 of 20 (60%) non-TNBCs (Figure 1). These
results suggest the dynamic expression changes of miR671-5p may be frequent events during the progression of
breast cancer.

miR-671-5p target gene prediction
FOXM1, a member of the FOX superfamily of
transcription factors, was one of the 7304 predicted target
genes of miR-671-5p by MICRORNA. FOXM1 has been
implicated to play a role in cell proliferation [11], cell cycle
control [12], DNA damage and repair, tumor development
and progression [13], and chemotherapy [14]. As such, we
chose to focus on the regulatory role of miR-671-5p on
FOXM1.

miR-671-5p regulates FOXM1 expression in
breast cancer
To validate the computational predictions and the
biological effects of miR-671-5p targeting FOXM1, we
first examined the expression of miR-671-5p and FOXM1
in breast cancer cell lines. We found that the level of
miR-671-5p was inversely related to FOXM1 expression
(Figure 2A).
To confirm the specificity of miR-671-5p targeting
FOXM1, we performed luciferase reporter assays with
pEZX-MT05 vectors containing the miR-671-5p binding
site (either wild type or mutant sequences) in the FOXM1
3’UTR region and DNA with pEZX-miR-671-5p or
pEZX-scrambled control (Figure 2B). After successful
co-transfection of the plasmids containing miR-671-5p
and FOXM1 3′UTR wild type sequence into breast cancer
cells, luciferase activities were significantly decreased in
miR-671-5p transfected MDA-MB-231 cells compared
with the cotransfection of those containing either miR671-5p /FOXM1 3’UTR mutant sequence or scrambled
control/ FOXM1 3’UTR wild type sequence. Decreased
luciferase activity was also observed in miR-671-5p/
FOXM1 3’UTR wild type cotransfected in Hs578T and
MCF-7 cells, although the differences were not statistically
significant (Figure 2C). Our data suggest that miR-671- 5p
specifically targets the 3′UTR region at 828- 848 nt of
FOXM1 (Acc# XM_005253676.2). Consistent with the
luciferase assay results, significant down-regulation
of FOXM1 mRNA was observed in MDA-MB-231,
Hs578T, and SKBR3 cells after overexpression of miR671-5p. Decreased expression of FOXM1 mRNA was
also observed in miR-671-5p transfected MCF-7 and
T47D cells, although the change was not statistically
significant (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence staining and
Western blot analyses showed decreased FOXM1 protein
expression in miR-671-5p transfected cells compared with

Attenuated expression of miR-671-5p in breast
cancer progression
In our previous work miR-671-5p was observed to
be downregulated in FFPE tissues during breast cancer
progression. To further investigate expression of miR671-5p in breast cancer progression, we analyzed miR671-5p (Acc#: MIMAT00038800) expression in a separate
cohort including 30 breast cancer samples microdissected
into normal and cancer cells from the FFPE tissue by
qRT-PCR. Downregulation of miR-671-5p expression

miR-671-5p induced S-phase cell cycle arrest

the mock control in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell
lines (Figure 3B and 3C). These results suggest that miR671-5p directly regulates FOXM1 expression by binding
to its 3′UTR in breast cancer.

Due to the role of FOXM1 in cell cycle [12], we
sought to examine the effects of miR-671-5p in cell
cycle regulation. miR-671-5p stable transfected MDAMB-231 cells were labeled with PI and analyzed by
DNA flow cytometry. Transfection of miR-671-5p into
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5A) caused an S-phase
cell cycle arrest and a corresponding decrease in the
G1 phase of the cells (Figure 5B). Because CCNB1 is a
downstream target of FOXM1, we investigated whether
the G2- phase cyclin, CCNB1 [16], was affected by miR671-5p expression. We found that CCNB1 expression was
decreased in MDA-MB-231 as expected (Figure 5B and
Supplementary Figure 1A). These findings suggest that
miR-671-5p regulates cell cycle via FXOM1 mediated
CCNB1 repression.

Overexpression of miR-671-5p inhibited breast
cancer cell proliferation and invasion
We have demonstrated that miR-671-5p suppressed
FOXM1 expression on both the mRNA and protein levels.
FOXM1 is a typical proliferation-associated transcription
factor [11]. To determine if overexpression of miR-671-5p
affects cell proliferation, we transfected miR-671-5p mimic
to breast cancer cell lines and examined proliferation via
MTT assays. Overexpression of miR-671- 5p resulted
in significantly reduced FOXM1 expression in protein
level (Figure 4A) and decreased proliferation (Figure 4B)
compared with the mock control. Conversely, transfection
of miR-671-5p inhibitor resulted in increased cell growth
in all cell lines. These results indicate an anti-proliferative
effect of miR-671-5p in breast cancer cells.
FOXM1 has been shown to promote tumor cell
invasion [15]. Using the BD Matrigel, we found that miR671-5p overexpression exhibited significant inhibition
of invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells (60%) and moderate
inhibition in Hs578T and SKBR3 cells (40%) compared
to the mock (Figure 4C). For non-TNBC cell lines MCF-7
and T47D the change in invasion was not as significant
as in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 Hs578T and
SKBR3. Conversely, transfection of miR-671-5p inhibitor
promoted cell growth in all cell lines except MCF-7 cells.
These results suggest that miR-671-5p might play a greater
role in TNBC cell lines than in non-TNBC cell lines.

miR-671-5p inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT)
EMT has recently been linked to cancer stem cell
phenotypes [17] [18]. MDA-MB-231 cell line displays an
elongated and a highly invasive, metastatic mesenchymal
phenotype [19] [20]. We observed that mock transfected
MDA-MB-231 exhibits the same mesenchymal shape as
the parental MDA-MB-231 cells (elongated, irregular
fibroblastoid morphology), while miR-671-5p transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells reversed to the epithelial shape
(rounded). On the contrary, a converse result was observed
after miR-671-5p knockdown by transfection of miR671-5p inhibitor in the stable transfected cells (Figure 5C,
top). We next aimed to determine whether it was possible

cells to undergo MET following expression of miR671- 5p. Consistent with this notion, immunofluorescence
(Figure 5C, middle) and Western blot (Figure 5C, bottom)
analyses revealed an upregulation of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin and a concomitant reduction in the
EMT marker vimentin in miR-671-5p transfected MDAMB-231 cells. The converse E-cadherin and vimentin
expression was observed with the transfection of miR671- 5p inhibitor in the stable transfected cells. These
findings suggest that miR-671-5p reversed the EMT
phenotype to a predominantly epithelial phenotype.
Therefore miR-671-5p could be a therapeutic target for
breast cancer metastasis.

were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-FOXM1 or
pcDNA3.1 control. After pcDNA3.1-FOXM1 transiently
transfection, increased proliferation capability was
detected in mock-stable-transfected MDA-MB-231, while
a slight increase in proliferation was observed in miR671-5p-stable-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, compared
to the pcDNA3.1 empty vector control (Supplementary
Figure 1A). We proposed that both endogenous and
exogenous FOXM1 was suppressed in miR-671-5p-stabletransfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggesting
that restoration of FOXM1 abolished the inhibition
of proliferation by miR-671-5p. In consistent with
proliferation capability, Matrigel invasion assays revealed
that restoration of FOXM1 abolished the inhibition of
invasion capabilities of miR-671-5p in stable-transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). Western
blotting analysis showed that overexpression of FOXM1
can restore the EMT marker vimentin and decreased
epithelial marker E-cadherin in protein level by miR671- 5p (Supplementary Figure 1C). These results suggest
that miR-671-5p functions as a tumor suppressor by
directly targeting FOXM1.

Overexpression of miR-671-5p sensitizes MDAMB-231 to chemotherapy and UV treatment

cisplatin, 5-FU and epirubicin [21] [14, 22]. Furthermore,
FOXM1 has been reported to respond to DNA damage
caused by IR (Infrared Radiation) or UV irradiation [23].
Based on our data, we reasoned that overexpression of
miR-671-5p could sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic
agents or UV treatment by downregulating FOXM1.

FOXM1 has been found to be overexpressed in
TNBC [14] and has been suggested as a critical mediator
of sensitivity and resistance to anticancer drugs, such as

miR-671-5p overexpression significantly reduced
post-UV/drug host cell reactivation activity

To evaluate this hypothesis, we treated miR-671-5p
transfected stable MDA-MB-231 cells with cisplatin,
5-FU, epirubicin, and UVC. Chemo/UV sensitivity was
determined by the MTT assay. As shown in Figure 6, cells
were treated with anticancer drugs and UVC in different
time or dose intervals. miR-671-5p overexpression
significantly increased cell sensitivity to cisplatin, 5-FU,
and epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to mock
transfected lines. Repression of miR-671-5p expression
by miR-671-5p inhibitor resulted in a converse effect.
However, a significant sensitivity was detected only after
48 h of UV exposure in miR-671-5p transfected MDAMB-231 cells. These results suggest that miR-671-5p might
be able to reverse anticancer resistance through inhibition
of FOXM1 as a new therapeutic target for breast cancer.

FOXM1 has been implicated in mediating drug
resistance in breast cancer by enhancing DNA repair [14].
We then asked whether miR-671-5p enhanced the
sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to chemotherapy via
DNA repair pathway. We measured luciferase activity by
transfecting pCMU-Luc vector, which was pre-treated by
anticancer drugs and UVC, into miR-671-5p transfected
stable MDA-MB-231 cells respectively. We found that
miR-671-5p transfected stable MDA-MB-231 cells
exhibited significantly reduced DNA repair capability
compared to the mock-transfected cells. Our results

as a percentage of the absolute cell number (bottom). Results are displayed as mean data ± SE (**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05). Five fields of unit

24 up- and 57 down-regulated genes. This is consistent
with our results above, where FOXM1 and CCNB1 were
significantly downregulated in miR-671-5p transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells compared with mock-transfected
cells. In addition, genes associated with cell proliferation,
invasion, cell cycle, and EMT were detected to be
downregulated in miR-671-5p transfected MDA-MB-231
cells, such as GINS Complex Subunit 2 (GINS2), cyclindependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and minichromosome
maintenance complex component 10 (MCM10) gene.
In SKBR3 cell line, we found 117 genes that were
differentially expressed (Supplementary Figure 1, t test, p <

expressed (Supplementary Figure 1, t test, p < 0.05, foldchange ≥ 1.5), 40 up- and 24 down-regulated.

miR-671-5p overexpression induces global gene

To fully examine the effect of miR-671-5p on
global gene regulation, we performed microarray analyses
to identify targets experimentally by comparing miR671- 5p transfected and mock transfected breast cancer cell
lines, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and MCF-7. The data was
deposited in GEO database (Acc# GSE62411). In MDAMB-231 cell line, a total of 81 genes were differentially
expressed (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary

Discussion

DNA repair capability. Thus, miR-671-5p appears to be a
novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.

MiRNAs have been shown to play important
roles in carcinogenesis. Thus far only a limited number
of studies have investigated miR-671-5p [10], [24, 25].
We report a previously undescribed mechanism for the
tumor suppressor role of miR-671-5p in breast cancer. We
showed that miR-671-5p: 1) was downregulated in breast
cancer; 2) suppressed proliferation and invasion of breast
cells by targeting FOXM1; 3) inhibited EMT and induced
S-phase arrest; and 4) sensitized breast cancer cells to
cisplatin, 5-FU and epirubicin treatment by impairing

miR-671-5p serves as a tumor suppressor in
human breast cancer progression by targeting
FOXM1
To date, aberrant expression of miR-671-5p has
been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma [25], lung
cancer [10], and epithelioid sarcoma [26]. In addition,
miR-671-5p has been showed to silence the SMARCB1
expression in epithelioid sarcoma [26] and to repress

BCL2L12 expression in melanoma [24]. In our present
work, we found that miR-671-5p was downregulated in
breast cancer progression, and forced expression of miR671-5p inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in breast
cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrated that miR671-5p is a potential tumor suppressor miRNA in breast
oncogenesis.
We showed that FOXM1 is a novel target of miR671-5p and that overexpression of miR-671-5p can
downregulate FOXM1. FOXM1 is a member of the FOX
superfamily of transcription factors. FOXM1 exerts crucial
role in a wide range of biological processes [27], including
as a human proto-oncogene [28] involved in metastasis
[29] and proliferation [30]. Unlike other Fox-transcription
factors, FOXM1 is associated with cell proliferation and
is expressed only in proliferating cells [31–32]. We further
found that forced expression of miR-671-5p in breast
cancer cell lines resulted in FOXM1 down-regulation and
significant proliferation and invasion inhibition, which
implicates a tumor suppressor function of miR-671-5p by
targeting FOXM1. In addition to FOXM1, our microarray
data (Supplementary Figure 1) showed reduced expression
of cell proliferation associated genes such as CDK2,
GINS2, and MCM10 (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure
1A) in miR-671-5p transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. We

analyzed the relationship between FOXM1 and these
genes by searching published data and bioinformatics
information (http://itfp.biosino.org/itfp/). We found that
CDK2, GINS2, and MCM10 are downstream genes of
FOXM1 [33, 34]. Thus, we reasoned that the inhibited
proliferation and invasion by miR-671- 5p is due to
suppressed FOXM1 expression and/or its downstream
target genes (Figure 7).
Notably, silencing FOXM1 expression by
miR- 671- 5p in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells inhibited their
proliferation and invasion, but not as significantly as in
MDA-MB-231cells. This suggests that miR-671-5p might
play a greater role in TNBC than in non-TNBC cells
(Figures 3 and 4).

miR-671-5p regulates cell cycle progression in
human breast cancer cells
FOXM1 has been demonstrated as a key cell
cycle regulator [27, 35, 36], which activates expression
of the cell cycle genes required for both S and M
phase progression [37]. However, detailed molecular
mechanisms that control the level of FOXM1 during
cell cycle progression remains elusive. In our study, we

FOXM1 could 1) inhibit GINS2 and promote cell proliferation; 2) inhibit CDK2 and enhance cell invasion and induce S-phase arrest;
3) inhibit CCNB1 to induce S-phase arrest; 3) inhibit MCM10 which is involved in S-phase arrest and EMT; 4) inhibit CCNB1 to induce
S-phase arrest; 5) affect DNA repair gene(s) to function in chemotherapy.

resistance and healthy tissue damage are major problems
in cancer treatment. Therefore, identifying specific
molecular targets in cancer therapy is essential. A recent
study has revealed that miR-671-5p was associated
with chemoradiotherapy [46]. Furthermore, FOXM1 is
implicated in drug resistance of genotoxic induction, but
its mechanism of action remains elusive. We found that
miR-671-5p overexpression resulted in downregulated
FOXM1, and further demonstrated miR-671-5p can
sensitize breast cancer to anticancer drugs. Our present
results implicate the potential effects of miR-671-5p on
chemotherapy by regulating FOXM1.
DNA repair activity plays a critical role in
therapeutic resistance. Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
is responsible for the repair of bulky DNA lesions
induced by UV and anticancer drugs. Cisplatin, 5-FU,
and epirubicin induced DNA damage is primarily repaired
via the NER [47] [48] [49]. HCR assay is applicable for
the analysis of different DNA repair systems. To address
the mechanism of miR-671-5p improving the sensitivity
of anticancer drugs and UV irradiation, we evaluated
the DNA repair activity by HCR. We observed that
overexpression of miR-671-5p impaired DNA repair in
breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that miR-671-5p might
correspond to the cellular stress upon radiation and DNA
damage agents.
Our data, for the first time, defined a role for miR671-5p as a tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer,
involving cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle arrest,
EMT, and chemotherapeutic sensitivity by directly
targeting FOXM1 and its downstream genes. Therefore,
miR-671-5p may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the
management of breast cancer, particularly for TNBC.

observed that the S-phase arrest in miR-671-5p transfected
cells is associated with downregulation of FOXM1 and
CCNB1. CCNB1 is essential for the initiation of mitosis.
Thus, reduced CCNB1 expression could explain the
ability of miR-671-5p for S-phase arrest and inhibition of
G2-phase entry. In addition, inhibition of CDK2 has been
associated with S-phase arrest [38] [39]. We detected
significant downregulation of CDK2 expression in miR671-5p transfected cells. Our data indicates that miR-6715p may regulate cell cycle via FOXM1 mediated CCNB1
and/or CDK2 downregulation (Supplementary Figure 1).

miR-671-5p plays an essential role in tumor
suppression by inducing a shift from EMT to
MET
Studies suggest that a round cellular morphology
supports a less stiff cytoskeleton configuration compared
with flat cellular morphology [40]. Bao et al reported
that overexpression of FOXM1 led to mesenchymal
phenotype, while inhibited FOXM1 expression by miR200b caused reversal of EMT phenotype in pancreatic
cancer cells [41]. In our study, we observed that miR671-5p transfected MDA-MB-231 cells showed an
epithelioid appearance and expressed epithelial cell
marker E-cadherin, while mock transfected cells
displayed elongated, irregular fibroblastoid morphology
and expressed typical mesenchymal marker vimentin,
suggesting a tumor suppressive effect of miR-671-5p
in EMT. It has been well documented that induction of
EMT was associated with aggressive characteristics,
such as cell attachment, migration, and invasion. We
found that miR-671-5p transfected MDA-MB-231
cells have a significantly decreased number of invasive
cells. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of
miR-671- 5p resulted in not only reduced expression
of FOXM1, but also the MCM10 gene (Figure 7 and
Supplementary Figure 1A). MCM10 is a nuclear DNA
binding protein and a predicted downstream target of
FOXM1. Chattopadhyay et al reported that MCM10
depletion by siRNA showed a similar cell morphological
change to miR-671-5p transfected cells. Furthermore,
they found that MCM10 depletion inhibited proliferation
and affected cell cycle progression [42]. Our data indicate
that the shift from EMT to MET is due to miR-671-5p
mediated downregulation of FOXM1 and MCM10. The
exact mechanism warrants further investigation.

Materials and Methods
Breast cancer cell lines and cell culture
The human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231,
Hs578T, SKBR3, BT-20, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and
T47D were purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Lonza) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and
streptomycin antibiotics. Immortalized MCF-10A cells
were cultured in MEGM medium (CC-3150, Lonza)
containing 100 ng/ml of cholera toxin to make a complete
growth culture medium. All cell lines were grown in a
37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

miR-671-5p sensitized breast cancer cells to
anticancer drugs

FFPE breast cancer tissue microdissection

Clinically, 5-FU and epirubicin are commonly used
drugs for breast cancer treatment, particularly 5-FU for
TNBC [43] [44]. Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent
not routinely used for breast cancer treatment. However,
it was reported that single-agent cisplatin could induce

George Washington University. FFPE breast tissues from
breast cancer patients were microdissected for the purpose
of confirming the expression level of miRNA-671-5p in
ADH, DCIS, and IDC as compared to normal tissue.

proliferation and invasion were examined by MTT assays
and Matrigel invasion assays. EMT marker vimentin and
epithelial marker E-cadherin were examined by Western
blot assays.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR)

Bioinformatics analysis and target prediction
The online software program from the website
www.microRNA.org was used for bioinformatics analysis
and target prediction of miRNAs.

FFPE and cell line total RNAs were isolated and
quantitated. miR-671-5p expression was assayed by
the Taqman MiRNA Reverse Transcript Kit (Applied
Biosystems), and target gene expression was analyzed
using the ABI 7300 System as described previously [3].
Primer sequences are available upon request.

Dual luciferase reporter assay
Cells were plated (7 × 105 cells/well) in 24 well
plates and co-transfected with 100 ng of DNA with pEZXFOXM1-3′UTR (wild type and mutant) expression clones
inserted downstream of the firefly luciferase gene and
100 ng of DNA with pEZX-miR-671-5p or the pEZXscrambled control (mock), using FuGENE Transfection
Reagent (Promega). An independently-controlled Renilla
luciferase gene was used as normalization control.
Luciferase activities were determined with the DualLuciferase Reporter System (GeneCopoeia). Each sample
was measured in triplicate using Glomax (Promega,
Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized
to Renilla luciferase expression for each sample.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted from cell lines using
RIPA Buffer (Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Protein extraction and western blot analysis
with chemiluminescent detection were as described [50].
The following antibodies and dilution factors were used:
FOXM1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (13147- 1- AP, 1:800,
Proteintech), cyclin B1 (CCNB1) rabbit polyclonal
antibody (4138P, 1:800, Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit
vimentin (5741, 1:100 Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit
E-cadherin (3195, 1:200, Cell Signaling), mouse GAPDH
monoclonal antibody (MA5-15738, 1:2000, Sigma), antirabbit IgG conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (7074S,
1:2000, Cell Signaling), and anti-mouse IgG (7076S,
1:2,000, Cell Signaling).

Transfection of miR-671-5p and FOXM1 in
human breast cancer cell lines
Transient transfection was performed as described
[5]. After overnight incubation, cells reached 30%–50%
confluence, were transiently transfected with miR-671- 5p
mimic (Cat# 4464066), mock (mirVana™ miRNA
Mimic, Negative Control, Cat# 4464059), inhibitor
(Cat# 4464084), and mock (mirVana™ miRNA Inhibitor,
Negative Control, Cat# 4464077) (Lifetechnologies) by
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) using the
Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies).
Cells were subjected for further analysis after 24 h
transfection. Stable transfections were done in 6-well
plates, seeded with 250,000 cells. pEZX-MR05-miR-671
containing the miR-671 precursor and pEZX-MR05control with a scrambled sequence was obtained from
GeneCopoeia (Rockville, Maryland, USA), and transfected
into MDA-MB-231 cell lines using the standard FuGENE
HD transfection reagent. Media containing puromycin
was applied 5 days post-transfection. Stable clones were
generated by plating 5 cells/ml of media in each well of
a 96-well plate. For rescue experiments, the pcDNA3.1FOXM1 plasmid containing full-length human FOXM1
was a kind gift of Dr. Huang (MD Anderson Cancer
Center‎). miR-671-5p/mock-stable-transfected MDAMB-231 cell lines were transiently transfected with
pcDNA3.1-FOXM1 and pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Cell

Immunofluorescence assays
Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells per well on
glass coverslips in six-well plates and fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde as described previously [5]. Confocal
images were obtained using a LSM 510 Confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss). The number of nuclei containing
at least one localized area of immunofluorescence was
determined by examination of the confocal images.
Antibodies for immunofluorescence assays used were as
follows: FOXM1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (13147-1-AP,
1:500, Proteintech) and BRCA1 (ab16780, 1:500, Abcam),
anti-rabbit vimentin (5741, 1:100 Cell Signaling) and antirabbit E-cadherin (3195, 1:200, Cell Signaling), Alexa
Flour 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen), and
Alexa Flour 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen).

Matrigel invasion assays
Matrigel invasion assays were performed using
the BD BioCoat™ Matrigel™ Invasion Chamber (BD
Biosciences) as previously described [51]. Briefly, prior
to the start of each experiment, 500 μl of warm (37°C)
serum-free DMEM medium was added to the upper

and lower chambers and allowed to rehydrate for 2 h in
a 37°C cell culture incubator while 8 × 104 cells were
transfected by either miR-671-5p and inhibitor or their
mocks and seeded onto the top chamber of pre-wetted
inserts. Cells were incubated in an Matrigel chamber
for 24 h. The invasive cells present were fixed, stained
with the Diff-Quick staining solution and counted (five
microscope fields under the 10X len). Experiments were
done in duplicates for each cell line twice. Cell counts
were performed on five non-overlapping random fields for
each chamber and four chambers were counted for each
experimental point, with the percentage of invasive cells
being normalized to corresponding controls.

was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8
(TE buffer) to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and
poured in a Petri dish to form 1D 2 mm thick layer. For
the drug treatment, 1 μl aliquots of a stock solution of
1 μg/μl cisplatin, 10 μg/μl 5-FU and 0.01 μg/μl epirubicin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in TE were added to
10 μg plasmid DNA dissolved in 200 μl TE buffer, and
the samples were incubated at 37°C for the 6 h. For UV
treatment, the petri dish was placed on ice and irradiated
by 1000 J/m2 of UV light. DNA repair capabilities were
assessed using a host cell reactivation (HCR) assay with
the pCMVLuc reporter gene plasmid treated by UV or
anticancer drugs [50]. Briefly, 4 µl (200 ng) of CsClpurified pCMVLuc plasmids, damaged or non-damaged,
were transfected with miR-671-5p overexpressing MDAMB-231 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Cell cycle distribution analysis
PI staining was used to analyze DNA content.
Stable transfected cells with miR-671-5p were plated at
concentrations determined to yield 60–70% confluence
within 24 h. Cells were harvested, and labeled with PI.
Briefly, cells were resuspended in PBS, fixed with 70%
ethanol, labeled with PI (0.05 mg/ml), incubated at room
temperature in the dark for 30 min, and filtered through
41-μm spectra/mesh nylon filters (Spectrum, Rancho
Dominguez, CA). DNA content was then analyzed using
the FACScan instrument equipped with FACStation
running Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson) at GW.
All experiments were performed in duplicate and yielded
similar results.

Human miR-671-5p overexpression and
microarray analysis
Human miR-671-5p or scrambled mock oligos were
purchased from LifeTechnologies. Dilutions of 90 pmol
of miR-671-5p oligos or mocks and 5 μl of Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM serum-free medium were
applied to 240,000 cells in a 6-well plate. Total RNA
from cells with miR-671-5p overexpressing cells were
converted to cDNA and amplified by Nugen WT Applause
Plus kit (Nugen). Then the cDNAs were fragmented and
biotin labeled by the Encode Biotin Module (Nugen)
before being hybridized to the Affymetrix Exon 1.0
ST array (Affymetrix). Data were analyzed using the
GeneSpring GX 12.6.1 (Agilent). Unsupervised clustering
heat map was generated on the genes with fold change
> = 1.5 fold and p < = 0.05. 

Chemosensitivity and MTT assays
We first established the stable miR-671-5p or
mock transfected cells, and then those cells were further
transient-transfected with miR-671-5p inhibitor or
inhibitor mock. Cells were washed with PBS. The MTT
solution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for 3 h, and removed and 100 μl DMSO was
added to each well and incubated in a 37°C humidified
incubator with 5% CO2 for 30 min. Color development
was measured using a spectrophotometer at 570 nm on a
plate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments) and quantified as per
the manufacturer protocol (Promega, USA). To determine
the drug effect after exposure, the miR-671-5p mimic or
mock stable transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with
various concentrations of cisplatin (0.5 to 8 µg/mL),
5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu), 2.5 to 20 nM), or epirubicin (50 to
200 nM). MTT was added and absorbance was measured
at different time points.

miR-671-5p expression in clinical samples was
analyzed by the exact two-sided binomial test. Data were
expressed as mean ± standard error (S.E.). Permutation
tests were performed for MTT assays between control and
miR-671-5p mimic transfected groups. The student’s t test
(two tailed) was applied to Matrigel assay between control
and miR-671-5p transfected group. P-values less than 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
