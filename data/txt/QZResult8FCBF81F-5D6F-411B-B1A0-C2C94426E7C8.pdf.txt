Abstract
Chemotherapy is an important treatment for ovarian cancer.
However, conventional chemotherapy has inevitable drawbacks due to side effects from nonspecific biodistribution of
the chemotherapeutic drugs. To solve such problem, targeted
delivery approaches were developed. The targeted delivery
approaches combine drug carriers with the targeting system
and can preferentially bring drugs to the targeted sites.
Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is an ovarian
cancer–specific receptor. By using a peptide derived from FSH
(amino acids 33–53 of the FSH B chain, named as FSH33), we
developed a conjugated nanoparticle, FSH33-NP, to target
FSHR in ovarian cancer. FSH33-NP was tested for recognition
specificity and uptake efficiency on FSHR-expressing cells.
Then, the antitumor efficiency of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded
FSH33-NP (FSH33-NP-PTX) was determined. FSH33-NP-PTX
displayed stronger antiproliferation and antitumor effects
compared with free PTX or naked PTX-loaded nanoparticles
(NP-PTX) both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, this novel
FSH33-NP delivery system showed very high selectivity and
efficacy for FSHR-expressing tumor tissues. Therefore, it has
good potential to become a new therapeutic approach for
patients with ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6506–14]

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic malignancies.
Because it often has no typical symptoms in the early stages, most
patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and have only a 30%
5-year survival rate.8 The routine treatment for patients with
advanced-stage disease is a combination of cytoreductive surgery
and chemotherapy. However, conventional chemotherapy has
inevitable drawbacks because of the side effects from nonspecific
biodistribution of the chemotherapeutic drugs (1). Thus, research
on targeted drug delivery system has focused on how to improve
efficiency and reduce the side effects at the same time. Unmodified
nanoparticles have been used as drug carriers to ensure more
efficient drug delivery (2). However, a majority of the drugs they
carry will concentrate in the liver and spleen through the
circulation, not the targeted foci. On the other hand, active drug-

targeting systems could avoid such downside as they have modified
drug-delivering microparticles based on the specific binding of
certain modified small molecules to targeted cells, ensuring specific
drug delivery into the targeted sites (3–5). The combination of
active targeting system and nanoparticulate carriers might be a
promising approach, which can not only target specifically to
tumor foci but also load more drugs to those sites (6).
An important step for the new system is to modify drug carriers
and conjugate drug molecules to nanoparticles. Poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) nanoparticles are a good choice for such a modification
based on their chemical characters (7, 8). The surface modifications of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and methoxy-PEG (MPEG) could
enable PLA nanoparticles to escape uptake by the mononuclear
phagocytic system so as to prolong its blood half-life (9–12). The
maleimide groups on maleimide-PEG-PLA make it possible for
nanoparticles to covalently couple to molecules with sulfhydryl
groups, such as antibodies or peptides (11, 13, 14), which bind to
specific cell surface receptors and mediate endocytosis after
binding.
Therefore, the choice of conjugated antibody or peptide as
target-specific ligand is also important for specific therapeutic
purposes. The ovary is the target organ of follicle-stimulating
hormones (FSH), which bind to the FSH receptor (FSHR), a
G protein–linked receptor. FSHR was found in the ovarian surface
epithelium (OSE) and in some ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues
(15–21); however, its distribution may be limited in the reproductive system (22). This expression pattern makes it possible to use
FSHR as the target site against ovarian cancer. FSH is a
glycoprotein hormone consisting of a and h chains, and some
FSHR-binding domains have been identified, including amino acids
1 to 15, 33 to 53, 51 to 65, and 81 to 95 of the FSH h chain (23–26).
Because FSH h 33-53 has the strongest binding affinity (data not
shown; ref. 24), it is used in our system as a target-specific ligand to
distribute drugs to ovarian tumor tissue.
In our study, we investigated the potential of FSH h 33-53
peptide–conjugated PEG-PLA nanoparticles (FSH33-NP) as a novel
drug delivery system. First, the expression of FSHR was examined
in human ovarian cancer cell lines and tissue specimens. Then, the
recognition specificity and uptake efficiency of FSH h 33-53 peptide
and FSH33-NP were evaluated by fluorescent probes. A chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel (PTX), was chosen as a model drug to
test our delivery system. The antitumor effect of PTX-loaded
nanoparticles (NP-PTX) against ovarian cancer was studied both

in vitro and in vivo, and our results indicated that PTX-loaded
FSH33-NP (FSH33-NP-PTX) has a better therapeutic effect against
ovarian cancer compared with NP-PTX or PTX alone.

Materials and Methods
Materials. MPEG was obtained from NOF Corp. and maleimide-PEG was
from Nektar. D,L-lactide was from Purac, and coumarin 6 was from Sigma.
PTX was purchased from Xi’an Sanjiang Bio-Engineering, and commercial
PTX injection was from Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory. Rabbit antihuman/mouse/rat FSHR polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.
Tissues of 30 human ovarian carcinoma specimens were obtained from
patients (ages 51.60 F 10.03 y; 23–72 y) admitted at the Obstetrics and
Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University after informed consent was
given. All specimens were identified by two pathologists following a doubleblind test.
Human ovarian carcinoma cell line Caov-3 was obtained from the
Reproductive Health Laboratory of the Women’s Hospital, Zhejiang
University (Hangzhou, China). Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines ES-2,
OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3 were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese
Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). Normal OSE cells were collected and
cultured with informed consent from the donors according to the protocol
of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Female BALB/c mice (Shanghai Cancer Institute, Shanghai, China) used
in this study were treated according to the protocols approved by the
ethical committee of Fudan University.
Preparation of FSH33-NP. Peptide FSH h 33-53 (YTRDLVYKDPARPKIQKTCTF) was synthesized and purified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). Nanoparticles were prepared with maleimidePEG-PLA and MPEG-PLA, which were synthesized by ring opening
polymerization (11, 27), using the emulsion/solvent evaporation technique
(28). Maleimide-PEG-PLA and MPEG-PLA were dissolved in dichloromethane and emulsified by sonication. Another emulsification was done in
2 mL of 1% sodium cholate aqueous solution. The water-oil-water multiple
emulsions were diluted into 25 mL of 0.5% sodium cholate aqueous
solution. After evaporation at 40jC, the nanoparticles were collected by
centrifugation. Coumarin 6–loaded nanoparticles were prepared in the
same way, except that coumarin 6 was added to the copolymer solution
before primary emulsification.
NP-PTX was prepared by an oil-water emulsification solvent evaporation
method (29). PTX (5 mg) was dissolved in 4 mL of dichloromethane
containing 2.5% maleimide-PEG-PLA and MPEG-PLA. The organic phase
was then added into 20 mL of 1% sodium cholate aqueous solution and
sonicated. The resulting emulsion was stirred at 40jC to evaporate
dichloromethane. The nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation.
To prepare FSH33-NP, the mixture of FSH h 33-53 peptide and
nanoparticles (the molar ratio of FSH h 33-53 peptide and maleimide was
1:1) was magnetically stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was then
isolated on a Sepharose CL-4B column by elution with HEPES buffer. The
milky FSH33-NP fractions were collected.
Nanoparticle characterization. The morphology of nanoparticles was
examined by transmission electron microscope (H-600; Hitachi). The
diameter and ~ potential were determined by dynamic light scattering
analysis using Zeta Potential/Particle Sizer Nicomp 380 ZLS.
To determine the content of PTX, nanoparticles were dissolved in
methanol and analyzed by a HPLC system. Optimization and validation of
the HPLC method were performed (data not shown). The entrapping
efficiency (EE) of PTX was calculated with the following equation:
EEð%Þ ¼

To analyze the surface atomic composition of C, O, and N of
nanoparticles and prove the existence of peptides on the surface of the
nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using
a PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer). The X-ray anode was run at
250 W and the voltage was kept at 14.0 kV. The pass energy was fixed at
23.50, 46.95, or 93.90 eV. The whole spectra and narrow spectra were
recorded by RBD 147 interface through AugerScan 3.21 software. Binding
energies were calibrated using the containment carbon (C1s, 284.60 eV).
The data were analyzed by XPS Peak Version 4.1 software.
Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the tissue sections of human ovarian cancer were
incubated with FSHR antibody and then with peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit IgG. Control was performed with nonimmune rabbit serum. The
staining reaction was done with diaminobenzadine and hematoxylin. For
immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The
remaining procedures were done in the same way.
Xenografts and Western blot analysis. To investigate the expression
of FSHR in tumor xenografts and main organs of mice, a total of 4  106
SKOV-3 or Caov-3 cells were injected s.c. into the axilla of 6-wk-old female
BALB/c mice. After 2 wk, tumor xenografts and the main organs of the mice
were harvested. The protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated
with FSHR antibody and h-actin antibody. After incubating with
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, immunodetection was performed
with enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to X-ray films.
Peptide binding assay. To prove whether FSH h 33-53 peptide
conjugated specifically to FSHR-positive ovarian cancer cells, SKOV-3 and
Caov-3 cells were incubated in PBS with 10 to 80 Amol/L of FITC-labeled
FSH h 33-53 peptide for 15 to 120 min. Then, cells were rinsed with PBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After mounting, cells were examined by
fluorescence microscope (Olympus). For flow cytometry, SKOV-3 and
Caov-3 cells were incubated in PBS with 20 Amol/L of FITC-labeled FSH h
33-53 peptide for 60 min. Then, cells were rinsed, collected, and analyzed.
Cellular uptake of FSH33-NP. To evaluate the capacity of FSH33-NP for
drug delivery into FSHR-positive ovarian cancer cells, coumarin 6 was
incorporated into the nanoparticles, and its concentration was detected by
fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The procedures were the
same as before, except that cells were incubated in Hank’s buffer with 0.1 to
100 Ag/mL of coumarin 6–loaded nanoparticles.
Cytotoxicity assay. To investigate the cytotoxicity of FSH33-NP-PTX, 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
was used. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium with different
concentrations (0.001–10 Amol/L) of PTX, NP-PTX, or FSH33-NP-PTX for 6
to 96 h, respectively. At the indicated times, the medium was replaced with
100 AL of MTT solutions (0.5 mg/mL). The formazan grains were dissolved
in DMSO and measured by a microplate reader at 490-nm wavelength. The
inhibitive rate was calculated as follows: 1 subtracts the percentage of
absorbance of the study group over the control group.
Antitumor effects of FSH33-NP-PTX in vivo. To evaluate the efficient
antitumor effects of FSH33-NP-PTX in vivo, BALB/c mice bearing human
ovarian carcinoma Caov-3 xenografts were established. Twenty-eight mice
were randomly divided into four groups administrated with saline,
commercial PTX, NP-PTX, or FSH33-NP-PTX via tail vein at a dose of
6 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The injection was repeated every 3 d for
five consecutive injections. Tumor size was measured with calipers every
2 d. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: p/6  larger
diameter  (smaller diameter)2.
Statistical analysis. Statistical evaluations of data were performed by
unpaired Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA. Data were expressed as
mean F SD. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

The release of PTX from nanoparticles was examined by incubating 1 mL
of NP-PTX in a dialysis bag and immersing in 100 mL of PBS (pH 7.4). The
entire system was stirred at 75 rpm at 37jC. The amount of PTX released in
each time interval was analyzed with the HPLC method.

by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. S1). After modification
of nanoparticles, we examined the shape and size of these nanoparticles under a transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1A).
Most nanoparticles and FSH33-NP loaded with or without
coumarin 6 or PTX were spherical and had a regular size. The
average diameters of nanoparticle and FSH33-NP loaded
with or without coumarin 6 were all 100 nm or so (Supplementary
Table S1). A diameter decrease to 51 to 78 nm was observed in
NP-PTX and FSH33-NP-PTX due to the synthesis technique. The
average ~ potential of all nanoparticles was 18 to 30 mV at pH 7.0,
suggesting that the conjugated peptide FSH h 33-53 did not cause

a notable change of ~ potential. The EE of NP-PTX was 69.33 F
5.13%. The in vitro release of PTX from nanoparticles exhibited
a biphasic pattern, which was characterized by a fast initial
release within the first 24 hours followed by a slower and continuous
release (Fig. 1B).
The surface chemical compositions of nanoparticles were
investigated by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, peaks 1 to 4
were in the C1s envelope. Peak 1 represented the carbon in C–C or
C–H. Peak 2 represented the carbon in OñC–NH. Peaks 3 and 4
corresponded to the carbons of ester and carboxylate, respectively.
Peaks 6 and 7 were in the O1s envelope. Peak 6 corresponded to

the oxygen of OñC, and peak 7 corresponded to the oxygen of O–C.
Peak 5 represented the N1s envelope.
Peak 2 of FSH33-NP was generated by OñC–NH due to covalent
binding of FSH h 33-53 and the maleimide group. According to the
chemical structure of nanoparticles, the nitrogen was derived from
either the maleimide group or FSH h 33-53. There was no N1s
envelope detected in nanoparticle, indicating that the amount of
nitrogen in the maleimide group was lower than the detection limit
of XPS and can be neglected (13, 30). The N1s envelope of FSH33NP (peak 5) could be attributed to FSH h 33-53 on the surface of
the nanoparticles. The percentage compositions of samples were
also analyzed. The surface nitrogen was only detected in FSH33-NP
with a value at 0.37% (Supplementary Table S2). This proved that
the peptide covalently bound on the surface of nanoparticles.
Expression of FSHR protein. To evaluate the possibility of
using FSHR as a therapeutic target, we first examined FSHR
expression on human ovarian cancer. FSHR expression was not
detected in six metastatic ovarian cancer specimens in which
tumors originated from other organs, whereas a majority of the
primary ovarian carcinomas (17 of 24, 70.83%) showed positive
staining for FSHR (Fig. 2A). This high expression rate indicated
that FSHR could be used as the target in our system. We also
checked FSHR expression on normal ovarian epithelial cells and
several human ovarian cancer cell lines. OSE, Caov-3, and ES-2 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

have higher FSHR expression levels than OVCAR-3 cells. No
expression was detected in SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 2B and C). Therefore,
SKOV-3 cells were used as negative controls in our study. We
generated tumor xenografts on BALB/c mice with either Caov-3 or
SKOV-3 cells. Western blot analysis showed that FSHR was
expressed only in Caov-3 xenografts and reproductive organs
(uterus and ovary). No FSHR expression was detected in the heart,
liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of BALB/c mice or SKOV-3 xenograft
(Fig. 2D). These results confirmed that the distribution of FSHR
was limited to specific organs and tissue. Therefore, a FSHRtargeted therapeutic strategy could be used to introduce drugs
specifically to those related organs.
Peptide FSH B 33-53 specifically bonded to FSHR-expressing
human ovarian cancer cells. To prove that peptide FSH h 33-53
could bind specifically to ovarian cancer cells that are expressing
FSHR, FITC-labeled FSH h 33-53 peptide was incubated with either
SKOV-3 or Caov-3 cells followed by fluorescence microscopy and
flow cytometry examination. This peptide could bind to the
FSHR-positive Caov-3 cells, but hardly to FSHR-negative SKOV-3
cells, even with extended incubation times (120 minutes) or high
concentration (80 Amol/L; Fig. 3A and B ). The increased
fluorescence intensity in Caov-3 cells correlated with both the
incubation time and the peptide concentration. By flow cytometry,
mean fluorescence intensity of Caov-3 cells was significantly higher

of FITC-labeled FSH h 33-53 peptide (9.443 F 0.438 versus
1.677 F 1.304; P < 0.05; Fig. 3C).
FSH B 33-53 enables coumarin 6–loaded nanoparticles to
specifically target Caov-3 cells. As FSH h 33-53 peptide can bind
to FSHR-expressing cells specifically, we then tested whether it can
still bind to FSHR when conjugated to nanoparticles. To evaluate
the uptake of nanoparticles, coumarin 6 was also incorporated into
nanoparticles as a fluorescent indicator. The amount of FSH33-NP
uptake in FSHR-positive Caov-3 cells was much higher than FSHRnegative SKOV-3 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 4A). Flow
cytometry showed that there was no significant difference for the
mean fluorescence intensities of SKOV-3 cells exposed to either
FSH33-NP or nanoparticles alone. However, the mean fluorescence
intensity of Caov-3 cells exposed to FSH33-NP was significantly
higher than those exposed to naked nanoparticles (6.397 F 0.287
versus 1.180 F 1.021; P < 0.05). This amount of uptake in FSH33-NP
increased with incubation time and FSH33-NP concentration
(Fig. 4B and C). We also noticed that the uptake amount of
coumarin 6–loaded FSH33-NP was much higher than that of
coumarin 6–conjugated nanoparticles in Caov-3 cells (6.397 F 0.287
versus 2.477 F 0.428; P < 0.05; Fig. 4D), whereas the difference in
the amount of nanoparticle uptake was not significant between

Caov-3 and SKOV-3 cells. These data strongly suggested that FSH h
33-53 on the surface of nanoparticles could not only drive specific
targeting at those cells expressing FSHR but also facilitate the
uptake of drugs carried by nanoparticles into those cells.
Effect of FSH33-NP-PTX on human ovarian cancer cells.
Next, we tested whether FSH33-NP could also mediate PTX
delivery to those cells. PTX is a chemotherapeutic drug often used
in patients with ovarian cancer, but it has very strong side effects
due to nonspecific uptake by other organs and tissues. Therefore,
more specific drug delivery would be desirable for PTX. We coupled
PTX with FSH33-NP and first tested its antitumor effect in vitro.
PTX, NP-PTX, or FSH33-NP-PTX was added to human ovarian
cancer cells. The MTT assay showed that the proliferation of Caov3 cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with
IC50s of 0.105, 0.284, and 1.198 Amol/L for FSH33-NP-PTX, NP-PTX,
and PTX, respectively. Incorporation of PTX to nanoparticles
decreased IC50 by four times, and FSH peptide incorporation
decreased IC50 by another 2.7 times. The inhibition rate of FSH33NP-PTX was f15% higher than NP-PTX at 0.1 Amol/L in Caov-3
cells (Fig. 5A), whereas FSH33-NP-PTX was approximately twice
more effective than NP-PTX with a shorter incubation time (<24
hours; Fig. 5B). Although nanoparticles coupled with PTX could
already help PTX uptake by cells, as NP-PTX is more effective than

PTX alone, NP-PTX is still a nonspecific drug and it could possibly
cause similar side effects when used in patients. On the other hand,
FSH33-NP-PTX showed higher specificity to FSHR-expressing cells.
As shown in Fig. 5C and D, FSH33-NP-PTX exhibited stronger

proliferation inhibition effects on Caov-3 and ES-2 cells than
OVCAR-3 cells, which have a lower FSHR expression level. This
significant inhibitive effect was not observed in OSE cells or
FSHR nonexpressing cells SKOV-3. Due to its higher specificity,

FSH33-NP-PTX was much more effective at lower concentrations
and shorter incubation times. Taken together, our data suggested
that FSH h 33-53 peptide–coupled NP-PTX could target FSHRexpressing cells more specifically and efficiently in vitro.
FSH33-NP-PTX treatment for human ovarian carcinoma.
Next, we tested the antitumor effects of FSH33-NP-PTX in vivo.
BALB/c mice bearing human ovarian cancer Caov-3 xenografts
were administrated i.v. with either saline solution alone or saline
with commercial PTX, NP-PTX, or FSH33-NP-PTX every 3 days for
five consecutive injections. The concentration of the injected drugs
was 6 mg/kg body weight, which was about half of the dose of PTX
normally used in mice (31). The final tumor size of treated mice
was notably reduced, especially for mice treated with FSH33-NPPTX (Fig. 6A), and the tumor growth curve showed that tumor
growth was delayed most prominently in the group treated with
FSH33-NP-PTX (Fig. 6B). The final average volume and weight of
tumor nodules in the FSH33-NP-PTX group were 0.29 F 0.08 cm3
and 0.33 F 0.13 g, respectively, which were significantly smaller
than the other three groups (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 6C and
D). The inhibitive rates calculated based on tumor volume and
weight were 69.95% and 68.37% in the FSH33-NP-PTX group, about
2 times higher than those in the NP-PTX group and 3.5 times
higher than those in the commercial PTX group. During the whole
study, no obvious side effects to the mice were found. At the study
end point, there were no significant differences in the average body
weights between the four groups, and the pathologic staining of
liver, spleen, and kidney showed no obvious differences in all
groups (data not shown). These data indicated that nanoparticulate carriers and peptide FSH h 33-53 could facilitate the

enrichment of drugs in tumor tissues so that the efficacy of drugs
could be improved with a smaller dose.

Discussion
In this study, we developed a novel active targeted therapeutic
system, FSH33-NP, and showed its potential as a promising drug
delivery strategy. FSH and its receptor have been implicated to play
critical roles in the development of ovarian cancer (32–36). We
found that 70.83% of human primary ovarian carcinoma specimens
expressed FSHR, and FSHR expression was detected only in
reproductive organs in BALB/c mice. Therefore, it is practicable to
use FSHR as the specific target site against ovarian carcinoma with
antagonisms of the receptor. Compared with commonly used
monoclonal antibodies, peptides are smaller, easier to prepare, and
have lower immunogenicity (3). Therefore, peptide FSH h 33-53
was chosen as a target-specific ligand due to its high affinity to
FSHR. This peptide was covalently attached to PEG-PLA nanoparticles.
The covalent attachment of FSH h 33-53 peptide and nanoparticles was achieved by means of the sulfhydryl groups of FSH h
33-53 peptides and the maleimide groups on the surface of
nanoparticles. XPS was performed to investigate whether the
covalent attachment was successful based on the amount of
surface nitrogen (13). XPS is a surface-sensitive chemical analysis
technique that measures the elemental composition, empirical
formula, chemical state, and electronic state of the elements of a
material. The kinetic energy and number of electrons that escape
from the upper 1 to 10 nm of the material can be measured. The

FSH Peptide-Conjugated Nanoparticles as a Novel Drug Carrier

Figure 6. Antitumor effects of FSH33-NP-PTX on BALB/c mice bearing human ovarian carcinoma. Four groups were administrated i.v. with either saline, commercial
PTX, NP-PTX, or FSH33-NP-PTX. The injection was repeated every 3 d for five consecutive injections (days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13). At day 21, mice were sacrificed.

detection limit of XPS is 0.1% (30). In this study, the N1s envelope
was only detected in FSH33-NP, which indicated that the detected
N1s signal of FSH33-NP ascribed to FSH h 33-53 peptides on the
surface of nanoparticles.
In our study, FSH33-NP was efficiently uptaken by FSHR-positive
Caov-3 cells (Fig. 4), as FSH h 33-53 on the surface of nanoparticles
could be specifically recognized by FSHR (Fig. 3). The mechanism
might be receptor-mediated endocytosis (37, 38). This kind of
endocytosis results in efficient internalization of ligand-modified
carriers in receptor-expressing cells (39–41). Our results are similar
to other studies showing receptor-targeted therapy for ovarian
cancer (42–44). A common chemotherapeutic drug in ovarian
cancer, PTX, was incorporated into nanoparticle carriers. The
antitumor efficiency of FSH33-NP-PTX was determined both
in vitro and in vivo. On a tumor xenograft model, the antitumor
effect of FSH33-NP-PTX was significantly stronger than commercial PTX or NP-PTX. The tumor-inhibitive rate of FSH33-NP-PTX
almost reached 70% and this was about 2 times higher than NPPTX and 3.5 times higher than commercial PTX. Our data not only
confirmed that nanoparticulate carriers could enhance the PTX
effect (45) but also suggested that FSH h 33-53 peptide could
further enhance the antitumor effect. However, the definite

mechanisms of how FSH h 33-53 facilitated the delivery of
nanoparticles still need further investigation.
Another great thing about our method is that a smaller dose of
PTX (6 mg/kg body weight) was given to those mice. Consequently,
no obvious side effects were observed (data no shown). This would
be of great help to cancer patients during chemotherapy as it could
reduce the pain they normally experience. Currently, most patients
with ovarian cancer have to go through surgery to remove both
ovaries and uterus followed by chemotherapy. If the future
diagnosis for ovarian cancer could be done in earlier stages when
the cancer cells have not migrated to other organs, our new drug
delivery system could even be used before surgery to target ovarian
carcinoma on-site first.
Taken together, this study showed that FSH h 33-53 peptide had
the potential to facilitate the access of drugs carried by nanoparticles with a high selectivity to ovarian tumor tissues expressing
FSHR. This novel FSH33-NP delivery system could not only
enhance the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs but also
minimize side effects in unrelated normal organs, and this delivery
system could also be used for therapeutic drugs other than PTX
to fight against ovarian cancer. Further studies will be needed to
illuminate these mechanisms.
