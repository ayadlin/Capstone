ABSTRACT
Arenobufagin, a representative bufadienolide, is the major active component in the
traditional Chinese medicine Chan’su. It possesses significant antineoplastic activity
in vitro. Although bufadienolide has been found to disrupt the cell cycle, the underlying
mechanisms of this disruption are not defined. Here, we reported that arenobufagin
blocked the transition from G2 to M phase of cell cycle through inhibiting the activation
of CDK1-Cyclin B1 complex; The tumor suppressor p53 contributed to sustaining arrest
at the G2 phase of the cell cycle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Moreover,
arenobufagin caused double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and triggered the DNA damage
response (DDR), partly via the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-Cdc25C signaling pathway.
Importantly, we used a synthetic biotinylated arenobufagin-conjugated chemical
probe in live cells to show that arenobufagin accumulated mainly in the nucleus.
The microscopic thermodynamic parameters measured using isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) also demonstrated that arenobufagin directly bound to DNA in vitro.
The hypochromicity in the UV-visible absorption spectrum, the significant changes in the
circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of DNA, and the distinct quenching in the fluorescence
intensity of the ethidium bromide (EB)-DNA system before and after arenobufagin
treatment indicated that arenobufagin bound to DNA in vitro by intercalation. Molecular
modeling suggested arenobufagin intercalated with DNA via hydrogen bonds between
arenobufagin and GT base pairs. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into
arenobufagin-induced cell cycle disruption that are valuable for the further discussion
and investigation of the use of arenobufagin in clinical anticancer chemotherapy.

Anticancer agents from natural sources have
attracted significant attention worldwide. For example,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts
for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers, is
the third most common cause of cancer-related death,
with approximately 782,000 newly diagnosed cases
and 746,000 deaths in 2012 worldwide [1, 2]. Although
surgical therapies are the first option for HCC patients,
HCC-associated mortality remains high [1]. In addition,
chemotherapy is minimally effective and accompanied
by severe toxicity and side effects. Sorafenib extends the

Suhneider is called toad venom (also termed Chan’su),
and its preparations have been widely used to treat several
cancers in China and East/Southeast Asian countries
[5]. The main active ingredients derived from Chan’su,
bufadienolides, are classical Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors
[6–8] that also exert antineoplastic effects. Specifically,
they induce apoptosis [9–11], disrupt the cell cycle [10,
12, 13], induce differentiation [14, 15], and inhibit cancer
angiogenesis [16, 17]. The mechanisms of bufadienolidesinduced apoptosis are implicated in several pathways,
including the mitochondria-mediated pathway [9, 10, 18],
the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [19], the ClC-3 chloride
channel [20], the IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway [11]
and DNA topoisomerase II [21, 22]. While bufadienolides
have been reported to disrupt the cell cycle, the underlying
mechanisms of this disruption have, to the best of our
knowledge, not yet been defined.
In an effort to isolate and identify active compounds
in Chan’su, we found arenobufagin, a representative
bufadienolide compound, substantially contributes to
the anti-cancer effects of Chan’su [19]. Arenobufagin
blocked the Na+/K+ pump current in cardiac myocytes
[23, 24]. Recently, our group showed that arenobufagin
inhibits the growth of a variety of human tumor cells [19]
and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis [17]. Arenobufagin has
also been shown to induce apoptosis and autophagy via the
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [19].
In this study, arenobufagin directly binded with
DNA via intercalative binding. This interaction led to
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and triggered the
DNA damage response (DDR) via the ATM/ATR signal
pathway, which subsequently resulted in G2 phase arrest
in HCC cells. This study has shed new light on the
mechanism by which arenobufagin interacts with DNA
to induce cell cycle arrest, and it is also the first to note
that bufadienolides may be DNA-targeting agents, which
will help elucidate the mechanisms of their anticancer
activities.

41.65 ± 0.49% in HepG2/ADM cells, and 40.3 ± 0.99%
in Hep3B cells (Figure 1A, right panel). The G2 and
mitotic cells were not distinguishable by PI staining,
because both populations contain 4N-DNA. Thus, the
cells were immunostained with p-Histone H3 (Ser10),
an M-phase-specific marker [25], to assess the mitotic
index. Arenobufagin significantly decreased the number
of mitotic HepG2 and HepG2/ADM cells (Figure 1B)
and slightly increased the mitotic index of Hep3B cells
to 15.34 ± 0.28%. Paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor [26],
was used as a positive control. The statistical analysis of
the DNA content and mitotic index data indicated that
arenobufagin inhibited the G2/M transition in HCC cells,
and the majority of cells were arrested in G2 phase rather
than in the M phase.

The role of p53 in the arenobufagin-induced
G2 response
As shown in Figure 1, the p53 wild-type cell lines
HepG2 and HepG2/ADM remained arrested in the G2
phase following arenobufagin exposure, with only a
fraction of cells becoming hypoploid by 48 h (7.8%
for HepG2 and 6.7% for HepG2/ADM). However, the
p53-null cell line Hep3B responded to arenobufagin with
G2 cell cycle arrest accompanied by a substantial increase
in the percentage of subG1 phase cells (approximately
20%), indicating that arenobufagin induced apoptosis.
To further verify that Hep3B cells underwent apoptosis,
Annexin V-FITC staining assay was performed. As shown
in Figure 2A, 48 h of arenobufagin treatment increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells from 4.5 ± 0.34% to 18.69 ±
0.70% in Hep3B cells, while the percentage of apoptotic
cells increased slightly in HepG2 cells (from 2.97 ± 0.21%
to 7.36 ± 1.13%) and HepG2/ADM cells (from 3.08 ±
0.34% to 4.99 ± 0.29%).
Interestingly, we also observed a transient
increase in transcriptionally active p53 in HepG2 and
HepG2/ADM cells following arenobufagin treatment
(Figure  2B). The differences in the p53 wild-type cell
lines (HepG2 and HepG2/ADM cells) and the p53-null
cell line (Hep3B cells) indicated that p53 may play a role
in arenobufagin-induced G2 arrest. To further investigate
the function of p53, HepG2 and HepG2/ADM cells were
transiently transfected with p53 siRNA. The transfection
of p53 siRNA efficiently abrogated both p53 expression
and p53 induction upon treatment with arenobufagin
(Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D and Supplementary
Figure S2A, transient transfection with p53 siRNA
and arenobufagin treatment reduced the number of
cells accumulated in the G2 phase by approximately
35%, whereas the hypodiploid peaks increased by
approximately 16% compared with arenobufagin
treatment alone. Besides, the Annexin V-FITC staining
assay also showed that transient transfection with
p53 siRNA and arenobufagin treatment increased the

RESULTS
Arenobufagin inhibits cell cycle transition from
G2 to M phase in HCC cells
Arenobufagin significantly inhibited the growth
of HCC cell lines, the p53 wild-type cell lines HepG2
and HepG2/ADM and the p53-null cell line Hep3B
(Supplementary Figure S1A). The effect of arenobufagin
on the cell cycle was assessed by staining these three
HCC cell lines, with propidium iodide (PI). As shown in
Figure 1A, exposing cells to arenobufagin significantly
increased the cell population in the 4N-DNA content
phase in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1A, left panel).
Quantitatively, arenobufagin treatment for 48 h resulted
in 4N-DNA contents of 47.95 ± 1.34% in HepG2 cells,

Tyr15 and Thr14 were up-regulated, while the total CDK1
protein level did not change (Figure 3A; Supplementary
Figure S3A).
The protein kinase Cdc25C, which belongs
to the dual-specificity Cdc25 phosphatase family,
dephosphorylates the two inhibitory residues of CDK1
(Tyr15 and Thr14) to activate the CDK1-Cyclin
B1 complex at the G2 phase [29]. Thus, the levels
of total Cdc25C and its phosphorylation at Ser216
(active residue) and Thr48 (inhibitory residue) were
analyzed [29]. As shown in Figure 3C, both the total
and phosphorylated Cdc25C levels time-dependently
decreased in arenobufagin-treated HCC cells. Importantly,
arenobufagin reduced the level of p-Cdc25C (Thr48)
more markedly than those of p-Cdc25C (Ser216) in
HCC cells (Figure 3C). We further quantified the ratio
of p-Cdc25C (Ser216) to total Cdc25C and the ratio of
p-Cdc25C (Thr48) to total Cdc25C (Supplementary
Figure S3B). Arenobufagin suppressed both the expression
and the phosphatase activity of Cdc25C. Collectively,

these results showed that arenobufagin down-regulated
Cdc25C, inhibited the dephosphorylation of CDK1Cyclin B1 complex, and ultimately blocked the G2/M
transition in HCC cells.

Arenobufagin activates the ATM/ATR-Chk1/
Chk2 signaling pathway
As the key regulators of cell cycle arrest, the
checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 inhibit the G2/M
transition [30]. Thus, we monitored the expression
levels and phosphorylation status of both Chk1 and
Chk2 in arenobufagin-treated HCC cells. As illustrated
in Figure 4, the phosphorylation status of the checkpoint
kinases p-Chk1 (Ser345) and p-Chk2 (Thr68)
significantly increased, whereas the total protein level
of Chk1 and Chk2 remained unchanged. ATR-dependent
phosphorylation activates Chk1 at residue Ser345 [31],
and ATM phosphorylates Chk2 at residue Thr68 [32].
Indeed, ATM and ATR were activated in the treated cells,

as indicated by the up-regulation of p-ATM (Ser1981) and
p-ATR (Ser428). These kinases were similarly activated in
293 cells treated with UV light for 4 h (Figure 4). These
data indicated that arenobufagin treatment activated the

and ATR. Consistently, pretreatment with caffeine also
significantly blocked the arenobufagin-induced increase in
the γ-H2AX signal (Figure 6B). Furthermore, combined
arenobufagin  and caffeine treatment significantly
decreased the proportion of cells in G2 phase arrest
compared with arenobufagin treatment alone (Figure 6C).
Taken together, these data demonstrated that G2 cell cycle
arrest was a downstream effect of arenobufagin-induced
DNA damage.

Arenobufagin induces DSBs
ATM and ATR are activated by phosphorylation
after DNA damage [33]. The ability of arenobufagin to
cause DNA damage was directly assessed with a comet
assay. As shown in Figure 5A, the appearance of DNA
in cells treated with arenobufagin for 24 h was similar to
that of a comet’s tail and differed from the intact DNA
of untreated cells. Quantitatively, arenobufagin increased
the Tail Length, Tail DNA%, and Olive Tail Moment in
a time-dependent manner (Figure 5A). Furthermore, we
analyzed the level of γ-H2AX, a marker of DSBs [34].
We observed a high γ-H2AX signal in cells after 24 h
arenobufagin treatment, as well as significantly increased
the number of punctate γ-H2AX foci (Figure 5B),
indicating that arenobufagin caused DSBs.

Arenobufagin binds with DNA
Because arenobufagin triggered DSBs, we
hypothesized that arenobufagin directly binds with
DNA. To verify this hypothesis, we assessed the cellular
distribution of arenobufagin. Because arenobufagin
does not fluoresce, it was conjugated to a D-biotin tag to
synthesize the chemical probe biotinylated-arenobufagin,
which strongly binds to streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SP).
SP can be directly visualized by immunofluorescence
[36]. The structure of biotinylated arenobufagin (DB7)
is shown in Figure 7A. The cytotoxicities of biotinylated
arenobufagin and arenobufagin did not significantly
differ, as indicated by an MTT assay (Supplementary
Figure S4A). Besides arenobufagin-conjugated chemical
probe also induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, like
arenobufagin (Supplementary Figures S4B and S4C). As
shown in Figure 7B, fluorescent biotinylated arenobufagin
signals were detected in the cytoplasm after 0.5 h and 1 h
of drug exposure. After 6 h, they appeared as punctuate
spots that progressively concentrated around the nuclear
envelope. Eventually, the biotinylated arenobufagin
fluorescence mainly accumulated in the nucleus at 12 h
(Figure 7B, arrows).

Arenobufagin-induced G2 arrest resulted from
DNA damage
Cell cycle arrest can be induced via various signaling
pathways, including the DDR. We used caffeine, an
inhibitor of ATM/ATR [35], which can block DNA damage
response, to assess whether arenobufagin-triggered DNA
damage caused the cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase in
HCC cells. As shown in Figure 6A, pretreating HepG2
cells with 2 mmol/L caffeine remarkably attenuated
the arenobufagin-induced phosphorylation of ATM

via the hydrogen bonds. The positive entropy indicated a
hydrophobic interaction. Thus, both hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions might contribute to the binding
of arenobufagin to DNA and increase the stability of the
arenobufagin-DNA complex. According to the equation
∆G = ∆H-T∆S (∆G is the free energy change, T is the
absolute temperature), the value of ∆G was negative,
indicating that the binding process was spontaneous.

To further test whether arenobufagin directly binds
to DNA in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
was employed to evaluate the microscopic thermodynamic
parameters driven by the formation of arenobufagin-DNA
complex. The results are shown in Figure 8A: Ka = 2.43E5

Arenobufagin binds with DNA via
intercalative binding

and significant changes in the CD spectrum are associated
with many DNA intercalators [37]. The classical
intercalator ethidium bromide (EB) [38] was utilized
to test whether arenobufagin intercalated with DNA.
As shown in Figure  8D, the distinct quenching of the
fluorescence intensity of the EB-DNA system after the
continuous addition of arenobufagin suggested that
arenobufagin binded with DNA in the same manner as the
bound dye EB.
To clarify the mechanism by which arenobufagin
intercalated with DNA, a docking study was conducted
using the GOLD program. The GC-rich B form of the
DNA double helix model (5′-d (CCGGCGGT)-3′) was
constructed [39]. As shown in Figure 8E, the pyran moiety

Next, we explored the mode by with arenobufagin
binds to DNA. Figure 8B showed the UV-visible
absorption spectra of DNA, with the peak position at
259 nm (line blue). Upon the addition of arenobufagin, the
absorbance decreased from 0.51892 to 0.39687 without
an apparent shift in the position of the absorption peak
(Figure 8B). Moreover, the addition of arenobufagin to
the DNA solution shifted the CD spectrum intensities
from −6.94282 to −6.11314 at the negative band and
from 6.39962 to 3.93849 at the positive band (Figure 8C).

of arenobufagin intercalated between GT base pairs via
the hydrogen bonds. The specific interactions were the
hydrogen bonds between NH2 in the pyridine moiety of G7
and O=C-O in the pyran moiety of arenobufagin in a sixmembered ring (Figure 8E). Moreover, a hydrogen bond
also formed between the NH (N1) of T8 and OH on C14 of
arenobufagin (Figure 8E). These findings agreed with the
ITC analysis.

bands are sensitive to the small molecules that bind with
DNA [44]. The changes in DNA morphology defined by CD
signals revealed strong intercalation between arenobufagin
and DNA. Consistent with this observation, arenobufagin
displaced EB from the DNA solution, supporting the
intercalation model. In addition, molecular modeling also
revealed that the pyran moiety of arenobufagin intercalated
between GT base pairs via the hydrogen bonds, as did the
NH (N1) of T8 and OH on C14 of arenobufagin. The negative
value of ∆H further demonstrated that the binding process
was associated with the formation of hydrogen bonds.
Importantly, the thermodynamic parameters obtained from
the ITC analysis (∆H < 0, -T∆S < 0, and ∆G < 0) revealed
that the binding progress was energetically favorable
and that arenobufagin either specifically binds or maintains
the membrane permeability. However, our current data
only demonstrated that arenobufagin directly binded to
DNA from HepG2 cells. Before getting to the conclusion
that arenobufagin is a DNA-targeting agent, we still need
to investigate whether arenobufagin also binds to DNA of
other cancer cells or non-tumor cells.
It has been demonstrated that small molecules that
bind to DNA can block DNA replication or cause DNA
lesions. In response to DNA binding agents, cells can
arrest cell cycle at G1/S or S phase to prevent incorrect
DNA replication, or at G2/M phase to prevent entry
into mitosis with damaged DNA [45]. We found that
arenobufagin impeded cell cycle progression at the G2
phase, suggesting that arenobufagin intercalated with
DNA might not block DNA replication, but instead
induced DNA damage. The comet assay confirmed that
arenobufagin induced DNA damage. The DNA damage
factors phosphorylated ATM, phosphorylated ATR and
phosphorylated γH2AX accumulate upon the activation of
DNA damage checkpoints [46], as observed in this study.
The DDR sensors ATM and ATR block the cell cycle partly
via the activation of a signaling cascade that activates the
checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1. Chk2 is phosphorylated
by ATM at residue Thr68 [32], and Chk1 is activated by
the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of residue Ser345 [31].
Active Chk2 and Chk1 phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser216
and decrease Cdc25C activity, and Cdc25C then sequesters
itself in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins [29].
The inactivated Cdc25C prevents the dephosphorylation of
the two inhibitory residues of CDK1 (Tyr15 and Thr14) to
maintain the CDK1-Cyclin B1 complex in an inactivated
state at G2, thereby inhibiting G2/M transition [29]. Here,
Chk1 and Chk2 kinases were activated, the levels of Cdc25C
phosphatase were down-regulated, and the two inhibitory
residues of CDK1 (Tyr15 and Thr14) were phosphorylated.
Overall, these data demonstrated that arenobufagin induced
DNA damag and ultimately led to G2 cell cycle arrest via
the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-Cdc25C pathway in HCC cells.
Furthermore, consistent with previous reports [47, 48], it
was also found that p53 may be an important determinant of
sustaining G2 arrest in response to arenobufagin treatment.

DISCUSSION
Bufadienolides, including cinobufagin, bufalin,
resibufogenin, hellebrigenin and bufotalin, are the major
pharmacologic constituents of Chan’su [40]. Bufadienolide
has been shown to disrupt the cell cycle. Cinobufacini
arrested MDA-M-231 cells at the S phase [41], and bufalin
arrested endometrial and ovarian cancer cells at the G0/G1
transition [42]. Our previous studies demonstrated that
hellebrigenin induced G2/M arrest in HepG2 cells [10], and
bufotalin caused G2/M arrest in HepG2/ADM cells [12].
However, these studies simply broached the subject of the
effect of bufadienolides on cell cycle disruption and did
not define the underlying mechanisms of this effect. Our
current study focused on these unaddressed mechanisms
and found that the bufadienolide arenobufagin directly
binds to DNA via the intercalative binding mode to
activate the DDR and ultimately induce G2 arrest in HCC
cells. We also demonstrated that the ATM/ATR-Chk1/
Chk2-CDC25C signaling pathway may contribute to the
G2 cell cycle arrest caused by arenobufagin.
To visualize the localization of arenobufagin,
we designed and synthesized a chemical biotinylatedarenobufagin probe using D-biotin as the tag. With
the aim of reducing the steric hindrance effect between
arenobufagin and D-biotin, poly(ethylene glycol) was
employed as a linker group. Based on previous reports,
the C-3 position of arenobufagin could be modified
without significantly influencing its antitumor activity
[20, 43]. Thus, poly(ethylene glycol) was used as a linker
between the 3-OH of arenobufagin and D-biotin to form
biotinylated-arenobufagin. The live cell images revealed
that biotinylated-arenobufagin accumulated mainly in
the nucleus. The data from ITC also demonstrated that
arenobufagin directly and strongly binds to DNA (the Kd
value was approximately 4.12 μmol/L).
Drug-DNA interactions can be classified into
intercalation and groove binding [37]. Based on the
characteristic parameters, small molecules bind to DNA by
intercalative binding as follows: approximately 4 kcal/mol
of free-energy cost, association constants (Ka) of 105 to
1011 M−1, and hypochromism in the UV-visible spectrum of
DNA [37], which are consistent with our data. Therefore,
we predicted that arenobufagin binds with DNA via
intercalation. The CD spectrum of DNA exhibits a negative
band at 245 nm induced by right-handed helicity and a
positive band at 275 nm induced by base stacking, and these

Increasing evidence indicates that bufadienolides
inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase to exert cardiotonic effect [6, 7].
Arenobufagin blocked the Na+/K+ pump current in
single guinea-pig cardiac myocytes with a half-maximal
concentration of 0.29 μmol/L [23], which is much higher
than the concentration (20 nmol/L) of arenobufagininduced cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, arenobufagin
at the concentration of 30 μmol/L is nontoxic to H9C2
cardiomyocyte cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). Based on
these data, arenobufagin may not cause cardiac side effects
at the concentration used in this study. Increasing evidence
has shown that some Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors, such as
ouabain, bufalin, induce cell cycle arrest in cancer cells,
although there is no report on that Na+/K+ ATPase directly
regulates the G2/M cell cycle progression [49, 50]. Indeed,
it is an interesting issue whether Na+/K+ ATPase-inhibited
activity contributes to arenobufagin’s cell cycle effect on
HCC cells, which still needs to be studied intensively.
Several documents report that mTORC1 or mTORC2
is involved in G2/M cell cycle progression [51–54]. Our
previous data demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR
promoted the development of both autophagy and apoptosis
in arenobufagin-treated HepG2 cells [20]. However,
transient transfection with mTOR siRNA and arenobufagin
treatment negligibly changed the cell numbers at

G2/M phase compared to arenobufagin treatment alone
(Supplementary Figure S5), indicating that mTOR may not
intermediate in the arenobufagin-induced G2 arrest.
Our previous pharmacokinetic study showed
that arenobufagin was detected in plasma with a peak
concentration of 1980 ng/mL (4.75 μmol/L) within 5 min
following intraperitoneal administration of 4.0 mg/kg
arenobufagin [55], implying that arenobufagin can be
absorbed quickly and the in vitro effective concentration
(20 nmol/L) for inducing cell cycle arrest and DNA
damage is able to be achieved in plasma. Further in vivo
mechanistic study is expected whether arenobufagin
inhibits solid tumor growth in vivo through inducing DNA
damage and cell cycle arrest.
In summary, we found that arenobufagin directly
binds to DNA via the intercalative binding mode in vitro.
We observed that arenobufagin accumulated mainly
in nucleus in live cells, as evidenced by a synthetic
tagged biotinylated arenobufagin conjugate. Moreover,
arenobufagin also caused DSBs and ultimately lead to G2
cell cycle arrest via the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-Cdc25C
pathway in HCC cells (Figure 9). These results shed new
light on the mechanism of arenobufagin-induced cell
cycle arrest, which is valuable for the further study of
arenobufagin use in clinical anticancer chemotherapy.

Figure 9: Proposed model for the mechanisms of arenobufagin-induced G2 arrest in HCC cells. Arenobufagin directly
binds with DNA via intercalation, leading to DSBs and triggering DDR via the ATM/ATR signaling pathway, which subsequently results
in G2 phase arrest in HCC cells.

Reagents

Cell cycle analysis

Arenobufagin (purity ≥ 98%) was extracted and
isolated from toad venom as previously reported [19].
The DOX and SP conjugates were obtained from Merck
Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). PI, ribonuclease
A (RNase A), DAPI and caffeine were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The OxiSelect™
comet assay kit was purchased from Cell Biolabs (San
Diego, CA, USA). The p53 siRNA kit and mTOR siRNA
kit were purchased from Genepharma (Shanghai, China).
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and the PureLink® Genomic
DNA Kit were purchased from Life Technologies
(New York, USA). The antibodies used in the mitotic index
assay, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy analysis
are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All other chemicals
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

The cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 75%
ethanol at 4°C overnight. The cells were incubated with
0.02 mg/mL PI and 0.1 mg/mL RNase A at 37°C in the dark
for 30 min. The cells were then analyzed by EPICS-XL flow
cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, California, USA),
and the phase distribution of the cell cycle was analyzed
using ModFit LT 2.8 software (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA).

Cell lines and cell culture

Mitotic indexes
The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100
for 30 min. After blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h, the plates were
incubated with an antibody against p-Histone3 (Ser10)
diluted in 2% BSA overnight. After washing with ice-cold
PBS, the plates were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 Goat
anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 2 h,
and the DNA was stained with DAPI for 5 min. The plates
were imaged using an ImageXpress Micro XL (Molecular
Devices, Silicon Valley, USA) with a 10× lens. The
mitotic indexes were determined by counting the number
of p-Histone H3 (Ser10)-positive cells in the number of
DAPI-positive cells (which served as the total number of
cells). At least 200 cells were analyzed using MetaXpress
software (Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, USA).

Preparation of chemical probe biotinylated
arenobufagin (DB7)
The principle and route of the DB7 synthesis is in
Supplementary Figure S6. The synthesis of the arenobufagin
derivative ClB4 and the linker moiety polyethylene glycolD-biotin DB6 are shown in the Supplementary Methods.
TEA (0.01 mmol) and DB6 (25  mg, 0.06 mmol) in
anhydrous THF were added to a stirred solution of ClB4
(20 mg, 0.04 mmol) and NaI (5 mg, 0.03 mmol) in 2 mL
anhydrous THF under nitrogen gas. The reaction was heated
to reflux for 7 h and monitored by TLC (DCM:MeOH =
20:1). The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure.
The residue was purified by flash column chromatography
(SiO2 4 g, DCM:MeOH = 8:1 with 0.1% TEA) to yield the
light yellow solid DB7 (10 mg, 28%). The structures of
ClB4, DB6 and DB7 were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR,
MS and HRMS (Supplementary Figures S7–S9). All final
compounds were purified to > 95% purity.

(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) to obtain
the total cellular protein. The cell lysates were collected,
and the concentrations were determined with a BCA assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A total of
30–50 μg of the lysates, 293 cell extracts and 293 cell + UV
(4 h) extracts (CST, Beverly, MA, USA) were separated
by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes.
The membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies
against the target proteins and subsequently incubated with
either an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody
conjugated to HRP. The protein bands were visualized
with an ECL kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA), and their images were captured on an X-ray film
(Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA). The protein levels
were quantified using ImageJ software (National Insitutes
of Health, Betheda, Maryland, USA).

the tail DNA%. All parameters were evaluated based on
at least 20 cells per sample using MetaXpress software
(Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, USA).

γH2AX staining assay
The cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated
overnight with an antibody against p-Histone H2A.X
(Ser139). After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(H+L) (1:1,000 dilution) for 2 h. The DNA was stained
with DAPI for 5 min. The plates were then washed and
mounted in ice-cold PBS. The cells were photographed
with an ImageXpress Micro XL (Molecular Devices,
Silicon Valley, USA) with a 40× lens. The granules (red) in
individual cells were counted using MetaXpress software
(Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, USA). The quantifiable
data were obtained from at least 200 cells per sample.

Small interfering RNA transfection

Cellular distribution of biotinylated arenobufagin

The cells were transfected with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) targeting p53 (100 nmol/L) or negative
control siRNA using Lipofectamine® 2000 according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The transfected cells were
exposed to arenobufagin for 48 h, followed by Western
blotting and cell cycle analyses.

The cells were exposed to 1 μmol/L biotinylated
arenobufagin for various time points, fixed and incubated
with SP (1:50 diluted with PBS). After washing three
times with PBS, the cellular distribution of biotinylatedarenobufagin was imaged using a confocal microscope
(Zeiss LSM700, Germany) with a 63× lens at an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm.

Co-immunoprecipitation
The cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer
(50  mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF,
2 mmol/L EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% NP-40, protease
and phosphatase inhibitors, pH = 7.5). The cell lysates
were collected, and the concentrations were determined
with a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). One milligram of protein extract was
incubated with an antibody against CDK1 at 4°C for
2 h before being incubated with G-Sepharose beads
overnight. The immunoprecipitated complex were
washed, centrifuged and dissolved in 2× loading buffer.
The samples were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described above.

Preparation of DNA from HepG2 cells
The DNA from HepG2 cells was purified using
the PureLink® Genomic DNA Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were harvested,
re-suspended in PBS, and digested with Proteinase K and
RNase A at 55°C. Binding buffer containing ethanol was
added to the mixed lysate to allow the DNA to bind to the
column. The proteins and impurities were removed by wash
buffers. The DNA bound to the silica-based membrane in the
column and then was eluted in low-salt buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0). The purified DNA concentrations
were spectrophotometrically determined using the molar
extinction coefficient Ɛ260 = 6600 M−1 cm−1. All DNA used
in subsequent experiments was purified from HepG2 cells.

Comet assay
The cellular DNA damage in single cell was
evaluated as described previously [10]. In brief, the
resuspended cells were mixed with melted agarose
and then pipetted onto slides. The samples were lysed,
denatured, electrophoresed, and stained with Vista Green
DNA dye. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axio Imager
A2 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).
The tail length was defined as the length of the comet tail
(Pixel). The tail DNA% was defined the percentage of the
intensity of tail DNA to the intensity of cell DNA. The tail
moment length was defined as the length from the center
of the head to the center of the tail. The Olive tail moment
was calculated by multiplying the tail moment length by

Isothermal titration calorimetry
The DNA from HepG2 cells was titrated against
arenobufagin in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) by ITC
using a MicroCal™iTC200 instrument (GE Health Care/
Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA). A total of 30 μmol/L
of DNA was injected into a 200 μL calorimetric cell and
titrated against 0.4 mmol/L of arenobufagin in a 40 μL
syringe at 25°C under constant stirring at 1,000 rpm. The
blank titration of DNA was conducted in buffer containing
DMSO. The resulting thermograms were analyzed with
one set of binding site models using Microcal Origin 7.0.

UV spectroscopy

Tripos force field by employing the Powell method with
an energy-gradient-convergence criterion of 0.05 kcal/
(mol  A°). Arenobufagin and nonpolar hydrogens were
removed from the energy-minimized complex, and
the residual DNA was assigned Kollman United-Atom
charges. The resulting DNA structure and intercalation
cavity were to study the docking of arenobufagin with
the GOLD program. To simulate the interaction between
arenobufagin and DNA, arenobufagin was treated as a
flexible ligand and docked into the intercalation cavity of
DNA based on default parameters. The docking results
were quantified by GOLDSCORE. The complex of
the docking result with the best score was then further
analyzed to explore the potential key interactions between
arenobufagin and DNA.

The spectrophotometric measurements were
recorded using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 25°C. We mixed 1 mmol/L
of DNA and 20 nmol/L of arenobufagin as described above
in 50 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0). After the solution
was mixed and equilibrated for approximately 5 min, the
absorption spectra were measured at wavelengths ranging
from 200 nm to 400 nm. A DNA solution of the same
concentration without arenobufagin was used as the blank.

Circular dichroic spectroscopy
Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were
performed using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 25°C. The CD scans were
recorded within a wavelength range of 200 to 400 nm at
sensitivity of 5 mdeg. All measurements were performed
in a cuvette with a volume of 400 μL in 50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH = 8.0). Individual titrations were performed with
1 mmol/L DNA in a reaction mixture containing 20 nmol/L
of arenobufagin. A DNA solution of the same concentration
without arenobufagin was used as the blank. The spectra
were measured based on an average of three runs.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times.
The quantifiable data were derived from three independent
experiments. The statistical analysis was conducted with
a one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons and
Tukey’s test using GraphPad Prism 5 software, and values
are presented as the mean ± SD. P value ≤ 0.05 was
considered to indicate significant differences.

Fluorescence spectroscopy

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The fluorescence emission spectra of the EB
displacement assay were recorded on a RF-5301PC
spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with
a xenon flash lamp. The EB-DNA complex was excited at
524 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded between
530 and 700 nm. A solution containing 0.006 μmol/L of
EB and 50 μmol/L of DNA was titrated with increasing
concentrations of arenobufagin, and the final reaction mixture
volume was 3 mL and contained 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH = 8.0). Appropriate blanks corresponding to the buffer
were subtracted to correct for the background fluorescence.

Molecular modeling
The 3D structures of arenobufagin were sketched
using SYBYL 7.0 (Tripos Associates; St. Louis, MO,
USA) and optimized with the Tripos force field. The
partial atomic charges were calculated using the GasteigerMarsili method. The intercalation between DNA and
arenobufagin was modeled by building a B-form duplex
DNA model with the sequence 5′-d(CCGGCGGT)-3′
using the BIOPOLYMER module in SYBYL. Hydrogen
atoms were then added, and Kollman All-Atom charges
were assigned to the DNA molecule. To generate an
intercalation cavity, arenobufagin was manually docked
into DNA: the pyran ring was positioned between two
base pairs (CCGGCGGT), while the other moieties were
located in the major groove. This initial complex structure
was then optimized via energy minimization with the
