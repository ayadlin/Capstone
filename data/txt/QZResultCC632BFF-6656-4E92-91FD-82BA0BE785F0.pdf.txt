Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When oxygen is abundant, quiescent cells efficiently extract energy from glucose primarily by
oxidative phosphorylation, whereas under the same conditions tumour cells consume glucose more
avidly, converting it to lactate. This long-observed phenomenon is known as aerobic glycolysis1, and
is important for cell growth2,3. Because aerobic glycolysis is only useful to growing cells, it is tightly
regulated in a proliferation-linked manner4. Inmammals, this is partly achieved through control of
pyruvate kinase isoform expression. The embryonic pyruvate kinase isoform, PKM2, is almost
universally re-expressed in cancer2, and promotes aerobic glycolysis, whereas the adult isoform,
PKM1, promotes oxidative phosphorylation2. These two isoforms result from mutually exclusive
alternative splicing of the PKM pre-mRNA, reflecting inclusion of either exon 9 (PKM1) or exon
10 (PKM2). Here we show that three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins,
polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB, also known as hnRNPI), hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, bind
repressively to sequences flanking exon 9, resulting in exon 10 inclusion. We also demonstrate that
the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc upregulates transcription of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2,
ensuring a high PKM2/PKM1 ratio. Establishing a relevance to cancer, we show that human gliomas
overexpress c-Myc, PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 in a manner that correlates with PKM2
expression. Our results thus define a pathway that regulates an alternative splicing event required for
tumour cell proliferation.

Alternative splicing of PKM has an important role in determining the metabolic phenotype of
mammalian cells. The single exon difference imparts the enzymes produced with important
functional distinctions. For example, PKM2, but not PKM1, is regulated by the binding of
tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, which results in release of the allosteric activator
fructose-1-6-bisphosphate and inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity5, a property that might
allow growth-factor-initiated signalling cascades to channel glycolytic intermediates into
biosynthetic processes. The importance of tumour reversion to PKM2 was underscored by
experiments in which replacement of PKM2 with PKM1 in tumour cells resulted in markedly
reduced growth2. Consistent with a critical role in proliferation, re-expression of PKM2 in
tumours is robust2, although little is known about the regulation of this process.

We set out to identify RNA binding proteins that might regulate PKM alternative splicing. To
this end, we prepared an [α-32P]UTP-labelled 250-nucleotide RNA spanning the exon 9 (E9)
5′ splice site (EI9), previously identified as inhibitory to E9 inclusion6, as well as a labelled
RNA from a corresponding region of E10 (EI10) (Fig. 1b), and performed ultraviolet
crosslinking assays with HeLa nuclear extracts7. After separation by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE), multiple proteins from 35–40 kDa appeared using the EI9 substrate,
whereas little binding was observed using the EI10 substrate (Fig. 1b). Strong binding was
mapped to a 19-nucleotide region we named EI9(50–68) that spans the E9 5′ splice site
(Supplementary Fig. 1). To identify the bound proteins, we performed RNA affinity
chromatography using a 5′ biotin-labelled RNA corresponding to EI9(50–68). After SDS–
PAGE and Coomassie staining, the pattern of specifically bound proteins closely matched that
observed after ultraviolet crosslinking (Fig. 1c). The four indicated proteins between 35–40
kDa were excised and identified by mass spectrometry as isoforms of hnRNPA1 and
hnRNPA2, RNA binding proteins with well established roles as sequence-specific repressors
of splicing (for example, see refs 7, 8). This result was confirmed by immunoblotting with
antibodies against hnRNPA1 (Supplementary Fig. 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The sequence immediately downstream of the E9 5′ splice site contains a UAGGGC sequence
that is highly related to the consensus hnRNPA1 high affinity binding site identified by SELEX,
UAGGG(A/U)9 (Fig. 1d). Consistent with previous mutational studies of an identical A1
binding site8, mutation of the G3 nucleotide of this motif to C led to a large decrease in
hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 binding (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3). The G3C mutation
resulted in increased splicing in vitro when introduced into a splicing substrate containing E9
(Supplementary Fig. 4), and led to increased E9 inclusion in a minigene construct in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These data confirm the presence of an inhibitory hnRNPA1/hnRNPA2
binding site immediately downstream of the E9 5′ splice site.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore the possibility that other splicing regulators bind upstream of E9 or E10, we
constructed crosslinking substrates (48 nucleotides) that span the region upstream of each exon.
Using these RNAs for ultraviolet crosslinking showed strong binding of a 55-kDa protein to
the I8 RNA probe, but not to the I9 probe (Fig. 1e). Inspection of the polypyrimidine tract
upstream of E9 revealed two potential PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein, or hnRNPI)
binding sequences (UCUUC)10 within 35 nucleotides of the intron/exon boundary, whereas
no such sequence exists in the E10 polypyrimidine tract. PTB frequently functions as a splicing
repressor10, often by binding repressively to the polypyrimidine tract11. Immunoprecipitation
confirmed that the 55-kDa crosslink observed using I8 RNA is PTB (Fig. 1e), and we observed
strong binding of PTB to a biotinylated version of I8 (Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition,
mutation of the two putative PTB binding sites from UCUUC to UGUUC significantly
diminished binding (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 7). Our data indicate that the splicing
repressor PTB binds specifically to the polypyrimidine tract of E9.
Because the locations of hnRNPA1/hnRNPA2 and PTB binding sites flanking E9 overlap
elements critical to exon inclusion (the polypyrimidine tract for PTB11, the site of U1 snRNA–
pre-mRNA base-pairing for hnRNPA1/hnRNPA212), we speculated that these proteins are
inhibitors of E9 inclusion. To examine this possibility, we used short interfering RNA (siRNA)
to deplete hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2 and/or PTB from HeLa cells. We assayed the PKM messenger
RNA isoform ratio using RT–PCR followed by exon-specific restriction digestion (Fig. 2a).
Knockdown of hnRNPA1 or hnRNPA2 in HeLa cells resulted in little change in splicing pattern
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Because we have previously observed functional redundancy of
hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA27, we next simultaneously depleted both proteins (Fig. 2b). This
resulted in an increase in PKM1 mRNA, from 2% to 29%, and a concomitant decrease in
PKM2 mRNA (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). PTB knockdown also increased the
PKM1 isoform, to 16% (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 8), consistent with earlier

observations13. Next, we simultaneously depleted all three factors, which further increased
PKM1 levels to about 48% (Fig. 2c). Similar results were obtained using 293 cells, with the
triple knockdown resulting in an increase from 5% to 67% PKM1 (Fig. 2d). Increases in
PKM1 mRNA upon knockdown of hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2 and PTB were observed in all cell
lines tested, including the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the glioblastoma cell line U87
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Knockdown of two other cancer-associated splicing factors in HeLa
cells, the SR proteins ASF/SF2 and SRp20, while also resulting in slowed growth, failed to
affect PKM1/PKM2 ratios significantly (Supplementary Fig. 8 and 10), indicating that the
effects seen in PTB/hnRNPA1/hnRNPA2-depleted cells on PKM splicing are specific and not
the result of pleiotropic effects due to changes in cell growth. Together, our results indicate
that expression of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 is the critical determinant of PKM isoform
in transformed cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next wished to determine whether expression levels of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 and
alternative splicing of PKM are correlated. We first examined whether changes in PTB,
hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 levels correlate with changes in PKM splicing during switching from
growth to quiescence. To this end, we used the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, which, when
grown to confluence and then switched to low-serum medium, undergoes myogenic
differentiation, a process that includes PKM2 to PKM1 switching14. We differentiated C2C12
cells for 6 days, and used RT–PCR followed by restriction digestion to assess the PKM1/PKM2
ratio each day. We observed a large increase in Pkm1 and a corresponding decrease in Pkm2
mRNA during differentiation (Fig. 3a). We then prepared lysates of C2C12 cells at time points
throughout differentiation and examined protein levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 3b). PTB
expression dropped over 70% by day 3 of differentiation, after which it remained stable,
consistent with previous studies15. We also observed an approximately 50% decrease in
hnRNPA1 levels by day 3 of differentiation, although no significant changes were observed
in the level of hnRNPA2. This result is consistent with a role for PTB and hnRNPA1 in
maintaining high PKM2 levels in proliferating C2C12 cells.

Because of the importance of the PKM2 isoform to the growth of cancer cells, we next
examined human glioma tumour samples for a correlation between PTB, hnRNPA1 and
hnRNPA2 expression and PKM splicing. We first assayed PKM1 and PKM2 mRNA levels as
described earlier. Normal brain tissue ranged from 4% to 13% PKM2, pilocytic astrocytoma
samples expressed approximately 66–77% PKM2, low-grade astrocytomas ranged from 7%
to 73%, and glioblastoma multiforme samples expressed 72–86% PKM2 (Fig. 3c). To explore
a potential correlation between elevated PKM2 mRNA levels and expression of the regulatory
proteins we identified, we performed immunoblots for PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2.
Notably, all high-PKM2 tumours expressed elevated levels of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2,
with the most striking overexpression in glioblastoma multiforme samples (Fig. 3d). Consistent
with their uniformly high PKM2 expression, all four pilocytic astrocytoma samples also
showed overexpression of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2. In low-grade astrocytomas the two
high-PKM2 tumours showed elevated expression of the three proteins, whereas the two lowPKM2 tumours showed expression levels similar to normal brain. Immunoblotting for four
other splicing factors (ASF/SF2, Tra2β, TLS (also called FUS) and hnRNPK) revealed no
correlation with PKM2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that the correlation
between an elevated PKM2/PKM1 mRNA ratio and overexpression of PTB, hnRNPA1 and
hnRNPA2 is specific and not reflective of a general property of splicing factors.
The tight coupling of PKM2 expression to proliferation suggests that expression of the PKM
splicing regulatory proteins we identified might be under the control of a proliferationassociated regulatory mechanism. A strong candidate to control this is the oncogenic
transcription factor c-Myc, which, like PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, is upregulated in
glioblastoma multiforme16, and has been shown to bind the PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2

promoters17,18 and upregulate the expression of all three19,20. Consistent with a role for c-Myc
in PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 regulation, we observed a near perfect correlation between
the levels of c-Myc and those of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 in gliomas and differentiating
C2C12 cells (Fig. 3b, d). Furthermore, the transcription factor N-Myc, which is closely related
to c-Myc21, was upregulated in pilocytic astrocytomas and to a lesser extent in glioblastoma
multiforme samples (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that this protein may in some cases
contribute to PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 upregulation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined directly the involvement of c-Myc in expression of PTB, hnRNPA1 and
hnRNPA2 and splicing regulation of PKM. We first asked whether decreasing c-Myc levels
can affect PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 levels and the Pkm1/Pkm2 mRNA ratio. To this end,
we stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells with vectors bearing a puromycin-resistance marker that
express either a c-Myc-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or a control shRNA.
Immunoblotting showed a reduction in c-Myc levels in cells stably transfected with c-myc
shRNA compared to control cells (Fig. 4a). Protein levels of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2
were also significantly reduced after depletion of c-Myc, in contrast with two other RNA
processing factors not implicated in PKM splicing regulation; that is, ASF/SF2 and CPSF73
(Fig. 4a). Ptb, Hnrnpa1 and Hnrnpa2 mRNA levels were also significantly reduced in the
knockdown cells (Fig. 4b), supporting the idea that c-Myc regulates transcription of these
genes. Importantly, the cells expressing the c-myc shRNA showed a pronounced increase in
the Pkm1/Pkm2 ratio, expressing 33% Pkm1 mRNA compared to 7% in the control (Fig. 4c).
A separate line stably expressing a second c-myc shRNA revealed a similarly elevated Pkm1/
Pkm2 ratio, as well as reduced levels of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, showing that the
observed effects were not due to off-target effects of the c-myc shRNA (Supplementary Fig.
12). Additionally, we transiently co-transfected HeLa cells with an hnRNPA1 promoterluciferase construct with a c-Myc expression vector22, which resulted in a dose- and c-Mycbinding-site-dependent increase in promoter activity (Supplementary Fig. 13).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The above results demonstrate a direct role for c-Myc in maintaining high PTB, hnRNPA1 and
hnRNPA2 levels in NIH-3T3 cells. In contrast, c-Myc knockdown in HeLa cells revealed only
a small decrease in PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 levels, and no change in the PKM1/
PKM2 ratio (Supplementary Fig. 14), indicating that factors other than c-Myc might promote
PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 expression in these cells. One possibility is the transcription
factor E2F1, which, like c-Myc, binds upstream of all three genes18. However, knockdown of
E2F1, or of Rb, a negative regulator of E2F family transcription factors23, resulted in little
change in PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 levels (C.J.D., M.C. and J.L.M., unpublished data).
However, because the E2F and Rb families exhibit redundancy, this result does not rule out
involvement of the E2F/Rb pathway in regulation of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2. Indeed,
because of their importance to proliferating cells, it is likely that PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2
can be upregulated by proliferation-associated factors in addition to c-Myc.
The fact that PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 depletion results in switching to the PKM1
isoform suggests that RNA binding proteins can control the outcome of a mutually exclusive
splicing event by simultaneously acting as repressors of one exon (E9) and activators of the
other (E10) (Fig. 4d). Although it is easy to envision how these proteins exclude E9, how might
PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 promote E10 inclusion? A variety of RNA binding proteins,
including hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, have been shown to stimulate splicing of an adjacent exon
through intronic binding sites24. One proposed mechanism for this is intron definition, in which
intron-binding proteins induce intronic structures conducive to inclusion of the neighbouring
exon24. We propose that, like many alternatively spliced exons, PKM E10 is poorly recognized
by the splicing machinery in the absence of adjacent intron definition, and such a structure is
promoted by PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 binding (Fig. 4d).

We have demonstrated a critical functional consequence for observations connecting PTB,
hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 upregulation with cell proliferation25,26, transformation27,28 and a
wide variety of cancers (for example, see refs 26, 27, 29, 30). Given the critical role of these
proteins in promoting PKM2 production in tumours, overexpression of some combination of
them is, like PKM2 expression, likely to be a general phenomenon in cancer. The fact that the
proteins show some redundancy in promoting PKM2 splicing may ensure robust re-expression
of PKM2 in tumours.

Ultraviolet crosslinking substrates were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and
ultraviolet crosslinking was performed as previously described7. Mutations were introduced
in EI9 by PCR-based site-directed muta-genesis. Biotinylated RNAs for affinity purification
were purchased from Dharmacon, and RNA affinity chromatography was carried out as

Ultraviolet crosslinking, RNA affinity purification and immunoprecipitation
assays
We carried out ultraviolet crosslinking as previously described7. Briefly, we linearized the
ultraviolet crosslinking plasmids with an appropriate restriction enzyme and synthesized the
RNAs with [32P]UTP or [32P]CTP. We incubated 1 × 105 c.p.m. RNAs with 10 μg HeLa or
C2C12 NE in buffer D in a 20 μl reaction at 30°C for 15 min, then irradiated the samples with
ultraviolet light in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene), digested them with RNase A (10 μg
ml−1) and resolved them by SDS–PAGE. The RNA affinity pull-down experiment and
immunoprecipitation was preformed as described7. The 5′ biotinylated EI9(50–68) and I8 RNA
oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon. Antibodies were bound to protein Aagarose beads before immunoprecipitation. We used the following antibodies for
immunoprecipitation: BB7 for PTB, and MC3 for U2AF65.

In vitro and in vivo splicing assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A minigene containing PKM gene exon 8, exon 9, exon 10, exon 11 and flanking regions was
cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). G to C mutation was introduced in the minigene by
PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis11. Wild-type and mutated minigene vectors were
transfected into HeLa cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected and
PKM1/PKM2 ratio was analysed using RT–PCR followed by PstI digestion. In vitro splicing
substrates were constructed by replacing the first exon and downstream intronic sequence of
AdML pre-mRNA with PKM exon 9 and downstream intron 9 sequences or sequence with
mutated hnRNPA1 binding site. Pre-mRNA substrates were synthesized by in vitro
transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) following product protocol. In vitro
splicing of the wild-type and mutated pre-mRNA was carried out using HeLa nuclear extract
as described31.

RNA interference
We carried out RNA interference of PTB and hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 as described7. Briefly,
we plated HeLa, 293, MCF-7, or U87 cells at 2.5–3 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. The
next day, we mixed 50 pmol of hnRNPA1 duplex RNA and 25 pmol of the other duplex RNAs

medium and added this to cells after RNA duplex–lipid complex formation. For double and
triple knockdowns in HeLa and 293 cells, RNA duplexes were transfected simultaneously. The
control RNA duplex was used to ensure that parallel experiments had equal amounts of RNA.
In MCF-7 and U87 cells, the second and third RNA duplexes were transfected 6 h after the
previous transfection. Seventy-two hours after transfection, we collected cells for RNA
isolation and immunoblotting. We used the following siRNAs (Dharmacon; the sense strand
sequences are given): human hnRNPA1, 5′-CAGCUGAGGAAGCUCUUCA-3′; human
hnRNPA2, 5′-GGAACAGUUCCGUAAGCUC-3′; human PTB, 5′GCCUCAACGUCAAGUACAA-3′. ASF/SF2 depletion was performed as previously
described7.

c-myc shRNA stable cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stable cell lines expressing c-myc shRNAs or control shRNA were obtained by transfecting
pRS-shRNA vectors into NIH-3T3 cells followed by drug selection. Cells were plated in 10
cm plates. The next day, transfected cells were diluted and medium was replaced with medium
containing a final concentration of 3 μg ml−1 puromycin. After 7–10 days, a mixture of fastand slow-growing colonies appeared in cells transfected with c-myc shRNA, whereas only fastgrowing colonies appeared in cells transfected with control shRNA. Single slow-growing
colonies were isolated and cultured for c-Myc expressing cells. c-Myc expression was
examined by immunoblotting. Positive colonies were collected for RT–PCR and western
blotting. The following sense shRNA sequences were used: control, 5′GAGGCTTCTTATAAGTGTTTACTCGAGTAAACACTTATAAGAAGCCTCTTTTT-3′;

RT–PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from tissue culture and human brain tumour samples using Trizol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2.5–5 μg) was used for
each sample in a 20 μl reaction with 0.5 μl of SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen). One microlitre
of the cDNA library was used in a 50 μl PCR reaction containing 3 μCi [32P]dCTP. Ten
microlitres of the PCR products was digested by PstI and Tth111 I (human PKM) or EcoNI
(mouse Pkm) and the products were resolved by 6% non-denaturing PAGE. Primers used in
the PCR reactions were: human PKM exon 8 forward, 5′-CTGAAGGCAGTGATGTGGCC-3′;
human PKM exon 11 reverse, 5′-ACCCGGAGGTCCACGTCCTC-3′; mouse Pkm exon 8

patients were used for normal brain. Approximately 25–200 mg of each sample was obtained.
Half of the homogenate was used for Trizol RNA extraction, the other half of each sample was
processed for immunoblotting as described30.

Dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay
c-Myc expression vector and hnRNPA1 promoter vector were co-transfected into HeLa cells.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected and DLR assays were preformed
using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following product protocol.

Figure 4. c-Myc upregulates PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 and alters PKM splicing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Immunoblotting using NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing control or c-Myc-targeting shRNAs.
Signals were quantified and normalized to actin. b, RT–PCR using the same cell lines as in
a, using B2m (β2-μglobulin) as a loading control. Real-time RT–PCR was performed separately
to quantify the relative levels of Ptb, Hnrnpa1 and Hnrnpa2 mRNAs in control and c-Myc
knockdown cells, using Rpl13a as a reference gene. Relative levels of each are shown below
each panel, with s.d. indicated (n = 3). c, Pkm1/Pkm2 ratios in control and c-Myc knockdown
cells determined as in Fig. 2a. d, A model for PKM splicing regulation. Top: in adult tissues,
low expression of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 allows for recognition of E9 by the splicing
machinery and disrupts intronic structures favourable for E10 inclusion. Bottom: in embryonic
and cancer cells, PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 are upregulated, bind to splicing signals
flanking E9 and repress its inclusion. Binding of these proteins around E9 and possibly to other
sites creates an intronic structure favourable to E10 inclusion.
