ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma occurs mostly in children and young adults, who are treated with
multiple agents in combination with limb-salvage surgery. However, the overall
5-year survival rate for patients with recurrent or metastatic osteosarcoma is 2030% which has not improved significantly over 30 years. Refractory patients would
benefit from precise individualized therapy. We report here that a patient-derived
osteosarcoma growing in a subcutaneous nude-mouse model was regressed by tumortargeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (S. typhimurium A1-R, p<0.001 compared to
untreated control). The osteosarcoma was only partially sensitive to the moleculartargeting drug sorafenib, which did not arrest its growth. S. typhimurium A1-R was
significantly more effective than sorafenib (P <0.001). S. typhimurium grew in the
treated tumors and caused extensive necrosis of the tumor tissue. These data show
that S. typhimurium A1-R is powerful therapy for an osteosarcoma patient-derived
xenograft model.

ovary [12, 13], as well as soft tissue sarcoma [14, 15]
and glioma [16, 17]. S. typhimurium A1-R was also
effective against high-grade osteosarcoma, including
lung metastasis [18], breast-cancer brain metastasis
[19], and experimental breast-cancer bone metastasis
[20] in orthotopic mouse models of human cancer
cell lines. S. typhimurium A1-R was also shown to
be effective on pancreatic cancer stem cells [9], and
in combination with anti-angiogenic agents [11]. S.
typhimurium A1-R was also effective against cervical
cancer [21], melanoma [22], soft-tissue sarcoma [14],

INTRODUCTION
The tumor-targeting amino-acid-auxotrophic
strain Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) A1-R
is attenuated by auxotrophic mutations for Arg and Leu
[1]. S. typhimurium A1-R has also been selected for
high tumor virulence in vivo. S. typhimurium A1-R has
been shown to be effective against all major types of
human cancer in nude mouse models including: cancers
of the prostate [1–3], breast [4–6], pancreas [7–11], and

and pancreatic cancer [10, 11] patient-derived
orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models.
In recent studies, S. typhimurium A1-R was
shown to be effective in a patient-derived orthotopic
xenograft (PDOX) model of high-grade undifferentiated
pleomorphic soft-tissue sarcoma (UP-STS) grown
orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of nude
mice. Histological examination demonstrated eradication
of the tumor treated with S. typhimurium A1-R followed
by doxorubicin (DOX) [15].
S. typhimurium A1-R was also shown recently to
be effective against a PDOX mouse model of follicular
dendritic-cell sarcoma (FDCS) that was established in
the biceps muscle of nude mice. The FDCS PDOX was
resistant to both DOX and NVP-BEZ235 dactolisib
(BEZ), but was sensitive to S. typhimurium A1-R [23].
Osteosarcoma occurs mostly in children and young
adults [23, 24], who are treated with multiple agents in
combination with limb-salvage surgery. However, the
overall 5-year survival rate for patients with recurrent
or metastatic osteosarcoma is 20-30%, which has not
improved significantly over 30 years [25]. Refractory
patients would benefit from precise individualized therapy.
In the present study, we used a patient-derived
mouse xenograft model of osteosarcoma to demonstrate
much higher efficacy of S. typhimurium A1-R administered
by intratumor (i.t.) injection than the molecular-targeting
drug, sorafenib.

neoplastic chondroid matrix occupied by anaplastic
cells. Both the original patient tumor and the mousegrown patient tumor had hypercellular areas populated by
anaplastic cancer cells displaying nuclear pleomorphism,
coarse and hyperchromatic chromatin and abundant
mitotic figures.

Intra-tumor administration of S. typhimurium
A1-R was highly-effective, in contrast to
sorafenib, in a patient-derived osteosarcoma
xenograft model
Nude mice were randomized into 3 groups:
untreated control; treated group with sorafenib (10 mg/
kg, p.o., 5 days a week, for 3 weeks); and treated with S.
typhimurium A1-R (2.5×107 colony forming units [CFU],
by intra-tumor [i.t.] injection, weekly, for 3 weeks). All
tumors were measured twice a week.
Sorafenib significantly reduced tumor growth
(P<0.001), but the tumors continued to grow (Figure 2).
In contrast, tumors treated with S. typhimurium A1-R
regressed and were significantly smaller than sorafenibtreated tumors at the end of the study (P<0.001). Body
weight range in all mice was from 26.6 to 31.1 g on day
1. There was no significant difference in body weight
between the control group and treated groups at any time
points.

tumors

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

S. typhimurium, expressing green fluorescent protein
(GFP), was cultured in serial dilution from supernatants of
tumor homogenates. Fluorescent bacteria were detected at
all dilutions, indicating they were growing in the treated
tumors (Figure 3).

Figure 2: Intratumor (i.t.) administration of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) A1-R regresses a patient-derived
osteosarcoma xenograft model. Eighteen subcutaneous tumors in nude mice were randomized into 3 groups: untreated control (n = 6),

treated group with sorafenib (n = 6; 10 mg/kg, p.o., 5 days a week, for 3 weeks), and treated with S. typhimurium A1-R (n = 6; 2.5 × 107 colony
forming units [CFU], intratumoral injection, weekly, 3 weeks). All tumors were measured twice a week and tumor volume was calculated
using the following equation: Tumor volume (mm3) = tumor length (mm) × tumor width (mm) × tumor width (mm) ×1/2. Both sorafenib and
S. typhimurium A1-R effectively reduced tumor growth. In addition, tumors treated with S. typhimurium A1-R achieved regression and were
significantly smaller than sorafenib-treated tumors. Body weight was not lost in any mice. *P < 0.001. Error bars: ± 1 SD.

Effect of S. typhimurium on tumor histology

targeting obligate anaerobe Clostridium novyi NT has
shown efficacy in leiomyosarcoma patients treated i.t.
[28]. Bacterial therapy of cancer, after 80 years, has
returned to the clinic [29].
Our group has developed many mouse models
and treatment strategies for osteosarcoma [18, 30–38].
Bacterial therapy maybe the most efficacious.
Bacteria have important advantages for the treatment
of cancer. Many bacteria naturally target tumors and they
can be genetically-manipulated to improve selective tumor
targeting and to reduce infection of normal tissue. Bacteria
can directly kill infected cancer cells and possibly enhance
immune effects against the tumor, even when tumors are
drug resistant. Bacteria can grow in, and are not readily
cleared from, infected tumors. In addition, bacterial
targeting may not be limited by poor tumor vasculature
[29].
Previously-developed concepts and strategies of
highly-selective tumor targeting can take advantage of
molecular targeting of tumors, including tissue-selective
therapy which focuses on unique differences between
normal and tumor tissues [39–44].

S. typhimurium caused extensive necrosis in the
treated tumors as visualized in hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained tumors (Figure 4).
Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks
VEGFR, PDGFR, MAPK, and KIT, was previously
shown to have efficacy against recurrent or un-resectable
osteosarcoma as well as metastatic or recurrent
angiosarcoma in Phase II clinical studies [26, 27].
S. typhimurium A1-R, in addition to being
effective against the major types of human cancer
in orthotopic nude mouse models [1–17, 21, 22], has
been shown to be effective in patient-derived models
of pancreatic cancer [10, 11], soft-tissue sarcoma [14,
15, 23] and melanoma [22]. In the present study, we
now show that S. typhimurium A1-R could regress an
osteosarcoma in a patient-derived model in contrast to
sorafenib which could not.
Future experiments will examine efficacy
of S. typhimurium A1-R against PDOX models of
osteosarcoma and then in patients. Recently, the tumor-

MATERIALS AND METHODS

overnight on LB medium and then diluted 1:10 in LB
medium. Bacteria were harvested at late-log phase,
washed with PBS, and then diluted in PBS [1, 3, 4].

Mice
Athymic nu/nu male nude mice (AntiCancer Inc.,
San Diego, CA), 4-6 weeks old, were used in this study.
All animal studies were conducted with an AntiCancer
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)protocol specifically approved for this study, which
described the duration of the experiment, the frequency of
animal monitoring, the survival aspects of the study, and
any anticipated maximum tumor volume or weight loss
thresholds at which animals would be euthanized, and in
accordance with the principals and procedures outlined in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th
edition, under PHS Assurance Number A3873-1. Animals
were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of a 0.02 ml
solution of 80-100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine,
and 3 mg/kg acepromazine maleate. Ibuprofen (7.5 mg/
kg orally in drinking water every 24 hours for 7 days
post-surgery) was used in order to provide analgesia postoperatively in the surgically-treated animals.

Bacterial culture
To demonstrate bacterial viability in the treated
tumor, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was used.
Forty-eight hours after S. typhimurium A1-R i.t. injection
(2.5 × 107 CFU in 50 μl PBS), the treated tumor was
homogenized, then suspended in PBS (phosphate-buffered
saline, Corning, New York, NY). The suspension was
serially diluted, then cultured in LB agar for 12 hours.
GFP-expressing colonies of S. typhimurium A1-R were
detected by the OV100 Small Animal Imaging System
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) [45].

Treatment protocol
Ten days after implantation, tumors reached 9
mm in diameter. Tumor-bearing mice were randomized
into the following 3 groups of 6 mice each: G1, control
without treatment (n=6); G2, treated with S. typhimurium
A1-R (2.5 × 107 CFU in 50 μl PBS, i.t. injection), once
a week, for 3 weeks (n=6); G3, treated with sorafenib
(Selleckchem, Houston, TX, S7397), 10 mg/kg, p.o., 5
days a week, for 3 weeks (n=6). Tumor length, width
and mouse body weight were measured twice in a
week. Tumor volume was calculated with the following
formula: Tumor volume (mm3) = length (mm) × width
(mm) × width (mm) × 1/2. Data are presented as mean ±
SD. When a tumor was not detectible, the tumor response
was considered as complete remission. All treated mice
were sacrificed on day 25, and tumors were resected for
further histological evaluation [15].

Patient-derived tumor
The study was reviewed and approved by the UCLA
Institutional Review Board (IRB #10-001857) before the
study began. Written informed consent was obtained
from the patient as part of the above-mentioned UCLA
Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. A 16-year
old patient with localized left distal femoral high-grade
osteosarcoma underwent limb salvage distal femoral
replacement. One year later, three bilateral metachronous
pulmonary metastases appeared. The patient was
treated with curative surgery at the Division of Surgical
Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
The patient received chemotherapy using methotrexate,
cisplatinum and doxorubicin (MAP) peri-operatively.

Histological examination
Fresh tumor samples were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin before sectioning and staining.
Tissue sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in an ethanol series. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H &E) staining was performed according to standard
protocols. Histological examination was performed
with a BHS System Microscope (Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired with INFINITY
ANALYZE software (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa,
Canada) [15].

Establishment of a mouse model of osteosarcoma
by subcutaneous transplantation
A fresh sample of the osteosarcoma metastasized
to the lung was obtained and transported immediately
to the laboratory at AntiCancer, Inc., on wet ice. The
sample was cut into 5 mm fragments and implanted
subcutaneously in nude mice [15]. Implanted tumors were
established in 4 weeks. The established tumor was cut into
5 mm fragments, then these fragments were implanted
subcutaneously to the flank in nude mice for the treatment
study.

Statistical analysis
SPSS statistics version 21.0 was used for all
statistical analyses (IBM, New York City, NY, USA).
Significant differences for continuous variables were
determined using the Student’s t-test. A probability value
of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant [15].
