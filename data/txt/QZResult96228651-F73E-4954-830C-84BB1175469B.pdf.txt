Abstract

Author Manuscript

Macrocyclic compounds are central to discovery of new drugs but their preparation is often
challenging because of the energy barrier required for bringing together and fusing the two ends of
an acyclic precursor1. Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) 2,3,4 is a catalytic process that has allowed
access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules even on large scale (up to
200 kilograms)5. The potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of
its alkene, or one isomer might be needed for subsequent stereoselective modification (e.g.,
dihydroxylation6). Still, while kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been
reported7,8,9,10, the only available olefin metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E olefins
entails selective removal of the Z component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis10,
sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also
cause adventitious olefin isomerization, a particularly serious problem when the E alkene is
energetically less favored. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl–B(pinacolato)
group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling11, possess the requisite electronic and steric
attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E macrocyclic alkenes. Reactions are
promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and afford products in up to 73
percent yield and >98:2 E:Z ratio. Utility is highlighted by application to preparation of the
twelve-membered ring antibiotic recifeiolide12,13 and the eighteen-membered ring Janus kinase 2/
Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (JAK2/FLT3) inhibitor pacritinib14,15 the Z isomer of which has lower
potency than the E16. The eighteen-membered ring moiety of pacritinib, a potent in vivo anticancer agent in advanced clinical trials for treatment of lymphoma and myelofibrosis, was

We recently showed that kinetically E-selective cross-metathesis (CM) may be effected
between α-olefins and E-dihaloethene compounds with Mo monoaryloxide pyrrolide (MAP)
complexes17. However, kinetically E-selective ring-closing metathesis (RCM) poses several
distinct challenges. Larger amounts of an alkene reactant cannot be used to maximize
efficiency. Moreover, linear products generated by CM or RCM of terminal alkenes are more
hindered and cannot as easily re-associate with an active complex to cause loss of kinetic
selectivity; in an RCM reaction where one of the substrate olefins is 1,2-disubstituted this
distinction no longer applies. In considering a strategy for preparation of biologically active
molecules such as recifeiolide13 and pacritinib14, we envisioned that a diene precursor could
contain an E-1,2-disubstituted olefin and a suitable substituent (R; Fig. 1a) that can induce
facile and selective generation of metallacyclobutane II (via I), leading to an E-macrocyclic
alkene. As with the E-selective CM of alkenyl halides, II should be preferred (vs. III); the
steric pressure induced by the metallacycle’s Cβ-substituent and the larger aryloxide (vs.
imido) ligand in II should be less costly than that involving the group at the more proximal
Cα in III.

A suitable starting E alkene must satisfy the following six requirements: 1) It must be
accessible in stereoisomerically pure form (i.e., ≥ 98% E) through reliable, efficient and
inexpensive transformations. 2) It must possess the appropriate steric and/or electronic
attributes so that it is immune to stereoisomerization. 3) And yet, the substituent (R) must
not be so large so that the 1,2-disubstituted olefin is reluctant to undergo RCM at a
reasonable rate (i.e., I → II, Fig. 1a). 4) It must bear a substituent that can stabilize the
accumulated electron density at the adjacent Mo–C bond (cf. I, Fig. 1a). 5) The
corresponding Mo alkylidene generated after metallacyclobutane cycloreversion (cf. syn-i,
Fig. 1a) must be sufficiently long living and robust to promote catalyst turnover but not too
reactive to engender post-metathesis isomerization and/or facile decomposition. 6) The
aforementioned stabilization of alkylidene complex syn-i caused by the substituent (R) must
be balanced in order for the RCM to occur at a reasonable rate.

We first investigated several model substrates as precursors to sixteen-membered unsaturated
ring lactone 2; representative data involving the use of MAP complex Mo-1 for reactions
carried out at ambient temperature and under 28 torr of pressure are shown in Fig. 1b. Bis(αolefin) 1a was consumed completely after two hours and 80% of the product mixture was
macrocycle 2, which was generated with inferior selectivity (70:30 E:Z). The RCM of
chloro-substituted alkene 1b was evaluated next in part because we had previously found
chloro-olefins to be resistant to isomerization17; the issue was whether the electronegative
halogen atom would provide the necessary charge stabilization (cf. II, Fig. 1a). Attempts at
cyclization of 1b resulted in only 5% 2 (77:23 E:Z); this might be due to low stability of the
chloro-substituted Mo alkylidene, which can be more detrimental in a macrocyclic RCM
than a concentrated solution of a CM where its encounter with an α-olefin prior to
decomposition is more likely. We then explored the possibility of using an E-β-substituted
styrene, another structural motif successfully adopted in CM leading to E-chloro-substituted

olefins17. Here too the results were disappointing: attempted RCM with 1c gave a mixture of
compounds (90% conv.) within which we could detect ~15% 2. Excessive side products (see
Extended Data 1 for details) preempted accurate determination of stereoselectivity; among
several possibilities, the derived Mo benzylidene might react with the substrate to generate
stilbene (detected in the unpurified mixture) along with bis(α-olefin) 1a. Again, in CM
excess dichloroethene may react with a benzylidene to yield β-chlorostyrene and chlorosubstituted alkylidene, which can re-enter a productive catalytic cycle; this advantage does
not pertain to RCM. Ring formation with the sizeable dimethylphenyl silyl group (cf. 1d),
capable of stabilizing the electronic distribution in II by hyperconjugative delocalization of
electron density into the low lying Si–C σ* orbital, was similarly inefficient.

Author Manuscript

With the idea that further attenuation of Mo alkylidene reactivity might result in appropriate
activity and chemoselectivity (reaction at the α-olefin vs. the E-disubstituted alkene), we
turned to alkenylboronate compounds. Former investigations indicate that pinacolatoboryl
[B(pin)] MAP alkylidenes are less reactive compared to their carbon-substituted variants but
can deliver higher activity than those with a trimethylsilyl group18. Further, CM between
vinyl–B(pin) and terminal alkenes, including those with relatively hindered moieties, are
efficient19,20. In the event, RCM with alkenyl–B(pin) compound 1e proceeded to 70%
conversion of which 44% was macrocycle 2 formed in 96:4 E:Z selectivity (Fig. 1b). At
ambient pressure (vs. 28 torr), there was 47% conversion (35% 2) and stereoselectivity was
diminished (77:23 E:Z) probably because of larger amounts of methylidene complex (by
reaction with ethylene generated from homocoupling), which is adept at promoting E-to-Z
isomerization and especially prone to decomposition21,22. Catalytic RCM with (hexylene
glycolato)B-substituted alkene 1f was E-selective as well (93:7 E:Z) but efficiency was
lower (37% conv. to 2); this boronate group is less robust and not as practical to use.

Author Manuscript

Follow-up studies revealed that the alkylidenes derived from Mo-1 do offer the desired
balance between catalyst stability (efficiency) and high E selectivity (see Extended Data 2).
RCM with a MAP complex containing substituents at the ortho positions of its aryloxide
phenyl moieties was much less efficient and E-selective; we attribute this to the steric
repulsion within the corresponding metallacycle II. On the other hand, RCM with a species
wherein the aforementioned aryl units are smaller was stereoselective but inefficient
presumably because of rapid catalyst decomposition. Commonly used chiral Mo22 and Ru
complexes7 did not generate appreciable amounts of the macrocyclic alkene (homocoupling
was dominant), as was the case with the recently developed stereogenic-at-Ru systems10,23.
Accordingly, RCM with substrates containing an α-olefin and an E-alkenyl–B(pin) unit
were explored further.

The E-alkenyl–B(pin) moiety is stable to air and moisture and can be accessed by several
exceptionally E-selective and broadly applicable protocols catalyzed by readily available and
inexpensive complexes and/or reagents (see additional references 31–44). For example,
subjection of alkyne 3 (Fig. 2a), bearing an unprotected hydroxy group, to 20 mol %
Cp2ZrHCl, 4.0 equivalents of pinacolatoborane and 10 mol % Et3N (60 °C, 17 h; all are
commercially available)24 followed by routine ester formation furnished diene 1e in 70%
overall yield as a single isomer (>98% E). Treatment of 1e with 5.0 mol % Mo-1 for six
hours (vs. 2 h in Fig. 1b) at ambient temperature and 28 torr furnished lactone 2 in 60%

yield and 96:4 E:Z selectivity. In comparison (Fig. 1b), the most E-selective RCM reported
for bis(α-olefin) 1a was performed with 4.0 mol % Ru-4 and generated 2 in 77:23 E:Z
ratio25.

Author Manuscript

Twelve- to nineteen-membered unsaturated macrocyclic lactones 4–5 and 7–8 are additional
examples of the sequence that begins with E-selective zirconocene-catalyzed
hydroboration24 of a hydroxy-containing terminal alkyne (Fig. 2a; for synthesis of the
precursor to 6 by catalytic protoboryl addition, see below). These macrocyclic compounds
were obtained with substantially higher E selectivity (91:9 to >98:2 E:Z) compared to when
the related bis(α-olefin) compounds were used along with Ru-1 or Ru-2 (56:44–75:25
E:Z26). Although the latter set of reactions may at times be higher yielding, much of the
undesired Z isomer is formed whereas the present protocol delivers products that are
substantially more enriched in the E alkene. In our hands, these olefin isomers cannot be
separated easily. Use of the more active achiral NHC–Ru-carbene complexes gave typically
lower yields and/or E selectivities probably due to post-RCM events (see Extended Data 3
for list of previously reported cases).

Author Manuscript

The moderate yields in Fig. 3 may be attributed to a lack of a major degree of
conformational constraint. Homocoupling reactions thus become more competitive, as
manifested by the difference between the values for percent conversion (consumption of the
starting material) and the amount of the macrocycle formed. Additionally, although with a
diene possessing an α- and a 1,2-disubstituted alkene the possibility of self-metathesis and
oligomerization is reduced, RCM may be less facile because of steric hindrance at one of the
alkene sites [vs. a bis(α-olefin)]. Also, a homocoupled adduct now contains three
disubstituted alkenes [vs. two terminal olefins and a 1,2-disubstituted alkene in a
homocoupling product of a bis(α-olefin) starting material] and thus cannot as easily re-enter
the catalytic cycle (through “back-biting”)27. The higher yield with which 1a and other
bis(α-alkene) substrates are at times converted to 2 and other macrocycles reflects these
differences (cf. Fig. 2a and below).

E-Alkenyl–B(pin) fragments may alternatively be synthesized by E-selective protoboryl
additions to terminal alkynes catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) copper catalysts28.
Reaction of enyne 9 with B2(pin)2 (Fig. 3b), methanol and the NHC–Cu complex derived
from imidazolium salt 10 and CuCl (all are commercially available) afforded 11 in 77%
yield, >98% E:Z selectivity and with >98% chemoselectivity (i.e., <2% reaction at α-olefin).
The ensuing RCM gave Boc-protected (Boc, tert-butoxycarbonyl) macrolactam 12 in 44%
yield as the pure E isomer (<2% Z). Likewise, the catalytic protoboryl addition/RCM route
led to the formation of 14-membered macrolactam 13 and 21-membered ring lactone 14 in
38% and 51% yield and >98:2 and 93:7 Z:E selectivity, respectively (Fig. 2b). Lactam 12
was obtained in comparable yield (47% vs. 44% yield) by RCM of the bis(α-olefin) with
Ru-2 but as a near equal E and Z isomeric mixture. Again, E:Z ratio was substantially higher
with an E-alkenyl–B(pin) substrate (93:7 to >98:2 vs. 20:80–76:24 E:Z). The reaction that
affords 14-membered ring lactam 13 (Fig. 2b) is particularly interesting, as with the more
commonly used RCM strategy slow addition of the Ru complex is needed and the Z isomer
was formed preferentially due to substrate-control (20:80 E:Z); with the present approach
only the E macrocyclic alkene was formed (>98% E). Cyclization of the unmasked

secondary amide compounds (cf. 12–13) was inefficient (<5%); these transformations are
reported to take place more readily with Ru-based carbenes but again with minimal
stereocontrol10,26.

There are methods for synthesizing macrocyclic E-alkenes that involve catalytic alkyne
metathesis. A two-step procedure entails stereoselective silyl-hydride addition [(EtO)3SiH)]
to a macrocyclic alkyne promoted by a cationic ruthenium complex {1.0 mol %
[Cp*Ru(MeCN)3]PF6}, Cp* pentamethylcyclopentadienyl] followed by stereoretentive
protodesilylation with excess (2.0 equiv.) silver fluoride and methanol29. A more direct
approach30 is by E-selective hydrogenation with the aforementioned Ru-based species (5.0
mol %). The RCM of dienes introduced here has significant value because it is strategically
distinct. Furthermore, other than the significantly higher cost of Cp*Ru(MeCN)3]PF6 (vs.
Cp2ZrHCl or salt 10 and CuCl) alkyne hydrogenations are at times accompanied by overreduction and/or olefin isomerization30, affording difficult-to-remove byproducts.

We then probed applicability to stereoselective recifeiolide and pacritinib synthesis. A key
point was whether increased conformational rigidity of a substrate – however slight it might
be – translates into higher yields. Synthesis of recifeiolide’s 12-membered lactone through
RCM has been reported previously (Fig. 3a): simultaneous slow addition of a solution of 15
and another of 3.0 mol % Ru-1 to a third (refluxing) solution of dichloromethane over a 20
hour period followed by an additional 12 hours of reaction time (at 22 °C) afforded the
natural product in 80% yield and 82:18 mixture of difficult-to-separate E and Z isomers13
(Fig. 3a). In contrast, subjection of commercially available homopropargyl alcohol 16 to the
aforementioned zirconocene-catalyzed hydroboration conditions followed by its union with
7-octenoic acid (commercially available) gave diene 17 in 73% overall yield and >98% E
selectivity (Fig. 3a). Macrocyclic RCM with Mo-1 after six hours (vs. 32 h needed
previously) at ambient temperature and 28 torr of pressure (0.00125 M; ~50 mg scale)
delivered recifeiolide in 65% yield and as a single stereoisomer (vs. 82:18 E:Z reported
formerly) without the need for manipulation of multiple syringe pumps. What is more, with
a paraffin pellet containing ~5.0 mol % of Mo-1 (Fig. 3a) diene 17 was transformed to the
natural product in 55% yield and >98% E selectivity (0.001 M in toluene, 22 °C, 28 torr, 6
h). The absence of a methyl group results in lowering of RCM efficiency, as nor-receifolide
(19) was isolated in 48% yield and 98:2 E:Z ratio when Mo-1 was used (Fig. 3b); a more
significant diminution in yield was observed when the transformation was performed with
Ru-2 (29% yield, 79:21 E:Z).

Author Manuscript

The case of pacritinib (SB1518) is of special interest due to its exceptional therapeutic
activity14,15 and because the Lewis basic nitrogen atoms and the involvement of two
relatively electron deficient allylic ethers render an RCM approach markedly challenging
(Fig. 4). One reported case entails reaction of bis(α-olefin) 20 with 10 mol % Ru-3 at 40–
45 °C for four hours, affording 21 in 74% yield and 85:15 E:Z selectivity (inseparable
isomers)14. An acidic solution (pH = 2.0–2.2; added HCl) to generate the ammonium
derivative of the pyrimidine moiety presumably to counter catalyst inhibition was needed for
high efficiency.

We initially examined the RCM of boryl-diene 22 (Fig. 4), prepared by zirconocenecatalyzed hydroboration of the appropriate propargyl ether. Subjection of 22 to 10 mol %
Mo-1 at ambient temperature for 12 hours led to an inefficient reaction [25% conv. (17%
23)] but E selectivity was high (93:7 E:Z). When the RCM was performed with an
equivalent of B(C6F5)3 23 could be isolated in 60% yield and 95:5 E:Z selectivity. A notable
feature of the transformation with Mo-1 is that it could be carried out at much higher
concentration than the previous reactions or when a Ru complex is utilized (i.e., 0.02 M vs.
0.001 M in the transformation involving Ru-3 and the MAP-catalyzed reactions in Fig. 1–3).
Namely, 20 times less solvent was needed with a Mo complex, rendering the present
approach more practical and cost effective. The reason for this distinction is that
homocoupling of an allylic ether by a Mo alkylidene is slower than with a Ru carbene. This
feature is manifested by the observation that, while with 2.0 mol % Mo-1 there was 83%
homocoupling of 4-phenyl-1-butene within 10 minutes (0.1 M in benzene, 22 °C), <5% of
the same byproduct was detected with allyl benzyl ether. In contrast, there was 47%
homocoupling with allyl benzyl ether when 2.0 mol % Ru-3 was used. Such advantageous
(and largely unappreciated) chemoselectivity is probably because the reactivity of a high
oxidation-state Mo alkylidene derived from an allylic ether is diminished by the oxygen
substituent (stabilization of electron density at the alkylidene carbon by inductive effect). As
a result, the intermolecular reaction of such a species with another electron deficient allylic
ether (i.e., homocoupling) is less facile and lower amounts of Mo methylidene are generated.
A differently polarized Ru carbene does not offer the same advantage. These considerations
imply that RCM involving the Mo alkylidene derived from an α-olefin of an allylic ether
and a 1,2-disubstituted alkenyl–B(pin), which is even more electron deficient, is favored
because of the intramolecularity of the transformation.

There are two reasons why RCM of the more functionalized triether substrate 24 to afford
21 is compelling (Fig. 4; see the Supplementary Information for synthesis route). 1)
Macrocyclic olefin 21 has been previously converted to pacritinib14. 2) This particular
cyclization would allow for further examination of the effect of Lewis basic chelating groups
on catalyst activity. Compound 24 contains an additional di-allyl ether fragment that might
coordinate to the Lewis acidic Mo center to cause reduced catalyst activity; this was a
concern since the basicity of the new ether oxygen may be enhanced by the para amino
group. Indeed, although E selectivity remained high (93:7 E:Z), conversion of 24 to 21 under
the conditions used to prepare 23 was lower (34% vs. 60% yield). The Boc-protected variant
(25) was therefore investigated based on the logic that this modification would more firmly
diminish the Lewis basicity of the pyrimidine and the bis(ether) moiety. Subjection of 25 to
the same reaction conditions [0.02 M (e.g., ~25 mg 24 in ~1.8 mL of toluene), ambient
temperature] but without B(C6F5)3 followed by removal of the protecting unit furnished 21
in 73% overall yield and 92:8 E:Z selectivity.

Under N2, an oven-dried round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged
with an alkene substrate and anhydrous toluene. A paraffin tablet containing Mo-1 is added
and the vessel is connected to a 28 torr vacuum generated from a diaphragm pump. The
mixture is allowed to stir for 6 h at 22 °C under vacuum. At this time the reaction is
quenched by addition of wet ether, and the mixture is concentrated under vacuum.
Acetonitrile is added and the mixture is allowed to stir at 22 °C for 10 min. The slurry is
filtered through a short plug of silica gel and eluted with acetonitrile (5.0 mL). The filtrate is
concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography may be used to obtain pure product.
The E-alkenyl-B(pin) compounds can be accessed by a variety of reported methods 31–44.
Some products can be accessed with low E selectivities through RCM reactions with bis(αolefin) compounds catalyzed by Ru complexes45–47.

Extended Data 2. Performance of other catalyst types

Examination of alternative Mo MAP complexes (cf. Mo-2-3) shows that the precise identity
of the aryloxide ligand is crucial for achieving optimal efficiency and E selectivity.
Furthermore, with two widely employed achiral complexes (i.e., Mo-4 and Ru-4), efficiency
and E:Z selectivity are low. Two of the more recently introduced Z-selective Ru complexes
(Ru-5,6) afford only homocoupling products. Abbreviation: Mes, 2,4,6-(Me)3C6H2; R,

a, One way to achieve high kinetic E selectivity in macrocyclic RCM would be to utilize a
substrate where one of the reacting alkene sites is E-1,2-disubstituted, such that preferential
transformation through mode of association I and via metallacyclobutane II (vs. III) affords
the desired stereochemical preference. The starting acyclic E-alkene must meet several key
criteria: it must be readily accessible as the pure E isomer, sufficiently electron withdrawing
to facilitate metallacyclobutane formation (cf. I→II), resistant to post-metathesis
isomerization, not too large to diminish reaction rates and generate an alkylidene
intermediate (syn-i) that is not detrimental to the reaction outcome. b, A model RCM
process performed with 5.0 mol % Mo-1 and affording sixteen-membered ring lactone 2
indicated that the (pin)B-substituted E-alkene (cf. 1e) represents the most effective option. In
most cases, the major side product is derived from homocoupling of the two terminal
alkenes. Abbreviations: R, functional group; Ln, ligands; ND, not determined.
Reactions were performed under N2 atm. Conversion values and E:Z ratios were determined
by analysis of 1H NMR spectra of unpurified product mixtures (±2%); stereoselectivity for
reaction with 1c could not be determined due to formation of a comparatively complex
mixture. See the Supplementary Information for all experimental and analytical details.

Dienes accessed with high E-selectivity by catalytic hydroboration of a terminal alkyne, can
be converted to 12- to 21-membered ring macrocyclic alkenes with high E:Z ratios.
Transformations carried out with complexes Ru-1 or Ru-2 typically proceed with minimal
selectivity or afford the Z isomer preferentially (cf. 13), reactions with Mo-1 are
substantially more E-selective (91:9 to >98:2 E:Z). The difference between percent
conversion and yield values (of isolated and purified products) is largely due to competitive
homocoupling through the α-olefin terminus. Abbreviations: NR, not reported; pin,
pinacolato; Boc, tert-butoxycarbonyl; Ad, adamantyl; Cy, cyclohexyl; Cp, cyclopentadienyl;
DCC, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; DMAP, 4-dimethylaminopyridine.
Reactions were performed under N2 atm. Conversion (disappearance of the starting diene)
and E:Z ratios were determined by analysis of 1H NMR spectra of unpurified product
mixtures (±2%). Yields are for isolated and purified products and correspond to the RCM
step (±2%). In cases where the transformations have been previously reported, a specific
citation is provided. See the Supplementary Information for all experimental and analytical
details.

a, Application of the catalytic RCM strategy to the synthesis of antibiotic agent recifeiolide
helps underscore the utility of the Mo MAP-catalyzed process. It was previously illustrated
that macrocyclic RCM with slow addition of diene 15 to a refluxing dichloromethane
solution of carbene complex Ru-1 affords recifeiolide in 82:18 E:Z selectivity after a total of
32 hours of reaction time. The present approach delivers the target molecule with complete
E selectivity (>98:2) after only 6 hours at ambient temperature and without the need for slow
addition. Further simplifying the E-selective protocol is the possibility of using an air and
moisture stable paraffin tablet that contains Mo-1 complex to obtain the desired macrocycle
with similar efficiency and stereoselectivity. b, Efficiency of macrocyclic RCM is lower
without a methyl substituent, underlining the importance of structural pre-organization to the
facility of ring formation. Abbreviations: R, functional group; Cy, cyclohexyl; Cp,
cyclopentadienyl; pin, pinacolato; DCC, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; DMAP, 4dimethylaminopyridine.
Reactions were performed under N2 atm. Conversion values (disappearance of the starting
diene) and E:Z ratios were determined by analysis of 1H NMR spectra of unpurified product
mixtures (±2%). Yields are for isolated and purified products (±2%). See the Supplementary

Treatment of bis(allyl ether) 20 with 10 mol% Ru-3 under acidic conditions (to counter
catalyst deactivation) affords 21 in 85:15 E:Z selectivity. RCM with E-alkenyl–B(pin)
derivative 22 with Mo-1 affords higher stereoselectively but less efficiently (17% yield).
When the latter transformation was performed in the presence of
tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (to avoid catalyst deactivation), 23 was isolated in 60% yield
and 95:5 E:Z selectivity. The same procedure with triether 24 was highly stereoselective but
yield was lower (34%). Installation of a Boc unit (cf. 25) to diminish the Lewis basicity of
the pyrimidine and the ether moieties furnished the macrocycle with similar E:Z selectivity
and in 74% yield (after deprotection). A feature of the RCM with Mo-1 is that a relatively
high concentration of the diene substrates (0.02 M vs. 0.001 M for 22, 24 and 25).
Abbreviations: Mes, 2,4,6-(Me)3C6H2; pin, pinacolato; Cy, cyclohexyl; Boc, tertbutoxycarbonyl.
Reactions were performed under N2 atm. Conversion values and E:Z ratios were determined
by analysis of 1H NMR spectra of unpurified product mixtures (±2%) relate to the
disappearance of the starting diene. Yields are for isolated and purified products (±2%). See
