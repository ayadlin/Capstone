Cyclophilin B Supports Myc and Mutant p53-Dependent
Survival of Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells
Jae Won Choi1, Mark A. Schroeder2, Jann N. Sarkaria2, and Richard J. Bram1,3

Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive, treatment-refractory type of brain tumor for which effective
therapeutic targets remain important to identify. Here, we report that cyclophilin B (CypB), a prolyl
isomerase residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), provides an essential survival signal in glioblastoma
multiforme cells. Analysis of gene expression databases revealed that CypB is upregulated in many cases of
malignant glioma. We found that suppression of CypB reduced cell proliferation and survival in human
glioblastoma multiforme cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that treatment with small molecule
inhibitors of cyclophilins, including the approved drug cyclosporine, greatly reduced the viability of
glioblastoma multiforme cells. Mechanistically, depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of CypB caused
hyperactivation of the oncogenic RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, induction of cellular
senescence signals, and death resulting from loss of MYC, mutant p53, Chk1, and Janus-activated kinase/
STAT3 signaling. Elevated reactive oxygen species, ER expansion, and abnormal unfolded protein responses
in CypB-depleted glioblastoma multiforme cells indicated that CypB alleviates oxidative and ER stresses and
coordinates stress adaptation responses. Enhanced cell survival and sustained expression of multiple
oncogenic proteins downstream of CypB may thus contribute to the poor outcome of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors. Our ﬁndings link chaperone-mediated protein folding in the ER to mechanisms
underlying oncogenic transformation, and they make CypB an attractive and immediately targetable
molecule for glioblastoma multiforme therapy. Cancer Res; 74(2); 484–96. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant gliomas have an extremely poor prognosis
(1, 2), and require improved understanding of the molecular
mechanisms supporting tumor cell survival. Cyclophilins,
intracellular receptors for cyclosporin A (CsA; ref. 3), have
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, which accelerates the
folding of proteins (4). The ﬁrst cyclophilin identiﬁed,
cyclophilin A, mediates the immunosuppressive effect of
CsA by binding to calcineurin (5, 6). Cyclophilin B (CypB) is
a highly related cyclophilin in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER; ref. 7) and the nucleus (8). Previous research suggested
that CypB participates in multiple functions, including
hepatitis virus replication (9), immunosuppression (10),
chemotaxis (11), and prolactin signaling (12). To determine
its role in vivo, we generated CypB knockout mice (13), and

found that, other than moderate osteoporosis at older ages,
CypB is not required for viability, and is well tolerated.
Recent studies revealed several signaling pathways frequently activated in glioblastoma multiforme: the receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, the retinoblastoma pathway,
and the p53 pathway (1). Most glioblastoma multiforme
tumors have mutations in all three to enhance cell proliferation and survival, while allowing the tumor cells to evade
cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and death. Discovering ways to
modulate these survival signals will improve therapeutic
approaches for glioblastoma multiforme. Because they are
"druggable," cyclophilins are considered good therapeutic
targets. Recently, reports have implicated CypB in Stat3
activation and in generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in other cancer cells (14, 15). Here, we identiﬁed
CypB, for the ﬁrst time, as a key regulator of several signals
that fuel oncogenesis in glioblastoma multiforme, including
mutant p53, c-Myc (MYC), and Chk1. These ﬁndings offer
proof-of-principle that CypB inhibitors may be effective as
novel therapeutics for glioblastoma multiforme.

in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium, 10% FBS, and penicillin–streptomycin. Xenografts using U251 cells in nude mice
were performed as described previously (16). Brain-tumor
xenografts were obtained from the Mayo Brain Tumor Core
Facility. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), and their identities were veriﬁed
by the ATCC (except for U251, which is no longer tested by the
ATCC). Reagents were purchased from Sigma [cyclosporine,
chloroquine, 10058-F4, H2O2, 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), AICAR], Tocris (thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and eeyarestatin), Enzo (etoposide, daunorubicin),
or Calbiochem [WP1066, Stattic, MG132, and N1-(b-D-Ribofuranosyl)-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (ALLN)]). CsA
dimer and compound 41 were from the Mayo Chemical Core.
Short hairpin RNA–mediated silencing
TRC1.5 and TRC2 lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
vectors (Sigma) were prepared using the manufacturer's
instructions, and transduced into glioblastoma multiforme
cells for 14 hours, followed by puromycin selection 24 hours
later. Speciﬁc sequences are listed in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared at indicated times by lysis with
1% NP-40, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting
was conducted as described (13), using the indicated antibodies (sources are listed in Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
Gene expression analysis
TRIzol-isolated total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using
polydT primers and ampliﬁed to generate biotin-labeled cRNA.
Gene expression microarray used the Illumina HumanHT-12v4
BeadChip, visualized by staining with Streptavidin-Cy3 after
hybridization. Expression values were calculated using Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software [Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE50756). Real-time PCR
reactions used total RNA, reverse transcribed into cDNA, and
were run in triplicate. mRNA levels were normalized to Actin or
Gapdh, expressed as DDCt values.

nology) following the manufacturer's instructions. Percentages
were assessed by counting at least 300 cells for each.
Nuclear factor of activated T cells activation assay
Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation was
quantiﬁed by FACS analysis of a CD8 reporter under the
control of a trimeric NFAT-binding site in Jurkat cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin
in the presence or absence of cyclophilin inhibitors.
Protein disulﬁde isomerase staining
Cells were cultured on glass cover slides, ﬁxed with 2.5%
paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton
X-100 in PBS. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 5%
goat serum and stained with anti-protein disulﬁde isomerase
(PDI; Stressgen, 1D3).
Statistical analyses
Two-tailed Student t tests were used to measure the significance of a difference deviation between two means. Data are
shown as mean  SD, and signiﬁcant difference is represented
by P < 0.05 ( ).

Results
CypB is overexpressed in brain tumors
Given the potential that CypB regulates Stat3-dependent cell
proliferation (15), we asked whether CypB was expressed in
neoplasms. Oncomine database (www.oncomine.org) inspection revealed that CypB was upregulated in 98 of 398 analyses
of tumors (P < 0.05). The highest upregulation was in brain
tumors, with 14 studies comparing normal tissue with glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytomas, or oligodendrogliomas
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Rembrandt Repository
(http://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov) analysis indicated highest
CypB expression in glioblastoma multiforme tumors compared with all others, whereas lowest levels were in nontumor
brain (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Measurement of CypB abundance by Western blot analysis in primary human glioblastoma
multiforme cells revealed high amounts of CypB compared
with primary human astrocytes (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S1C).

Cell viability, cell death, and colony formation assays
Cells seeded in triplicate were cultured for the indicated
times, and then directly counted using trypan blue exclusion
for proliferation assays. Cell viability tests used AlamarBlue
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell
death was determined 3 to 5 days after lentiviral transduction
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of propidium iodide (PI)/Annexin V–Cy5 staining. For colony formation, cells suspended in complete medium containing 0.3%
agar deposited onto solidiﬁed 0.6% agar in 6-well plates were
quantiﬁed for colonies after 17 days.

Genetic ablation of CypB reduces glioma cell survival
and proliferation
We depleted CypB in human glioblastoma multiforme cells
using lentiviral-delivered shRNA. Knockdown of CypB significantly decreased the viability of glioblastoma multiforme cells
(Fig. 1C, D, and G). Increased death in CypB-depleted U251 cells
was conﬁrmed by increased sub-G1 fractions (Fig. 1E and F)
and Annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 1H). CypB knockdown also
reduced anchorage-independent colony growth in soft agar
(Fig. 1I).

Senescence-associated b-galactosidase assay
Cells plated in triplicate at 104 cells per well in 6-well plates
were assessed for senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SAb-gal) activity after 4 days (SA-b-gal Kit; Cell Signaling Tech-

Inhibition of CypB kills glioblastoma multiforme cells

Cyclophilin B as a Target for Malignant Gliomas

therapeutic, so we synthesized a nonimmunosuppressive
derivative of CsA (CsA dimer), which cannot inhibit calcineurin, yet retains cyclophilin-binding activity (17). CsA
dimer had equal effectiveness in killing U251 cells (Fig.
1J), yet was not immunosuppressive, indicating that its
cytotoxic effect results from cyclophilin inhibition, rather
than calcineurin inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Also,
compound 41, an unrelated small molecule shown previously to inhibit cyclophilin (18), killed glioblastoma cells (Fig. 1J
and Supplementary Fig. S1E), yet it demonstrated little
immunosuppression (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These inhibitors also killed two medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 1K;
Supplementary Fig. S1F–S1H).
CypB regulates Stat3-mediated glioblastoma multiforme
survival by supporting Jak2 expression
Stat3 nuclear localization in myeloma was reported to
be dependent upon CypB (15). We tested whether CypB
knockdown similarly altered Stat3 nuclear accumulation in
glioblastoma multiforme cells. Unexpectedly, knockdown
of CypB instead strongly decreased Stat3 phosphorylation upon oncostatin-M (OSM) stimulation (Fig. 2A), without affecting cell surface expression of its receptor (Fig. 2B).
CypB-knockdown T98G cells had reduced amounts of the
Stat3-speciﬁc kinase Jak2 (Fig. 2C and D), potentially
explaining decreased Stat3 phosphorylation. Jak2 mRNA
was not reduced (rather increased) by CypB silencing
(Fig. 2E and F), suggesting that CypB regulates Jak2 expression posttranscriptionally. Consistent with this, Stat3 inhibitors (19) increased cell death upon CypB knockdown, but
had little effect on control glioblastoma multiforme cells
(Fig. 2G and H). Combined treatment with CsA dimer and
Stat3 inhibitors also caused synergistic killing of tumor cells
(Fig. 2I).
CypB suppresses generation of ROS
CypB-depleted glioblastoma multiforme cells showed
higher ROS levels than control cells (Fig. 2J, K, and L), and
developed higher increases in ROS following H2O2 exposure
(Fig. 2M), indicating reduced ability to handle oxidative stress.
More CypB-knockdown glioblastoma multiforme cells died
following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2N), which was reversed by
the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (Fig. 2N).
CypB loss induces cellular senescence
Microarray analysis of RNA from control or CypB-knockdown U251 cells revealed approximately 130 genes affected
more than 2-fold by CypB depletion (Fig. 3A; Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). CypB-knockdown cells had a 3.4-fold
reduction in the transcript for uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2),
which suppresses ROS production during oxidative phosphorylation (20). These microarray results were similar to expression proﬁles of oncogenic Ras-induced senescent cells (Fig. 3D;
ref. 21), including increased levels of members of the senescence-associated secretome, such as IL-11, IL-6, IL-8, PLAU,
and SERPINE1. Several of these microarray results were validated by real-time PCR (Fig. 2B and O) and Western blot
analysis (Fig. 3C).

www.aacrjournals.org

As suggested by these ﬁndings, although the majority of
U251 cells died upon CypB knockdown, surviving cells
showed microscopic changes characteristic of senescence,
including large and ﬂat morphology, binuclear cells, and
massive vacuolization (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, CypB knockdown in U87 cells markedly increased SA-b-gal staining (Fig.
3H). Overexpression of oncogenic Ras (HRASV12) in glioblastoma multiforme cells evoked similar senescence-associated morphologic and molecular changes (Fig. 3F and G).
Oncogenic Ras activates the mitogen-activated protein
kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK)
cascades in senescent cells (21). CypB knockdown indeed
increased Erk phosphorylation in U251 cells on days 3 and 4
following shRNA expression (Fig. 3I) and caused Ras activation (Fig. 3J). MEK inhibitor (U0126) treatment reduced
this early hyperactivation of Erk and blocked cellular senescence in CypB-depleted glioblastoma multiforme cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Ras hyperactivation causes suppression of its own downstream signals due to Ras-dependent induction of the negative feedback inhibitors Sprouty,
RasGap120, and DUSP proteins (22, 23). Consistent with this,
by day 5 after CypB depletion, phospho-Erk was reduced
below the starting baseline (Fig. 3I). Furthermore, DUSP5
and Sprouty2 were among the top 35 upregulated genes in
CypB-knockdown glioblastoma multiforme cells (Supplementary Table S1). CypB knockdown or inhibition also
increased levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27/Kip1 (Fig.
3I, K, and L; ref. 24), and strongly reduced the p27-speciﬁc
E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2 (Fig. 3M). These results suggest that
aberrant activation of the RAS–MAPK pathway occurs following CypB suppression, and induces cellular senescence
in glioblastoma multiforme cells, possibly via increased p27.
CypB regulates MYC stability
We examined cells for known Ras targets previously implicated in cancer, such as MYC (25, 26). CypB depletion in
glioblastoma multiforme cells reduced steady-state levels of
MYC (Fig. 4A). Induction of MYC by OSM or AICAR (27) was
also blocked by CypB knockdown (Fig. 4B and C). CypB
regulation of MYC is posttranscriptional because its silencing
did not reduce MYC mRNA (Fig. 4D).
Cyclophilin inhibitors also decreased MYC expression (Fig.
4E), which was reversed by the proteasome inhibitors MG132
and ALLN (Fig. 4F). Jak2 and phospho-Stat3 were similarly
reduced in MYC-knockdown cells, suggesting that Stat3 activation is partially dependent upon MYC (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, MYC-knockdown cells demonstrated higher levels of
ROS and decreased UCP2 mRNA (Fig. 4H and I), implicating
MYC as a mediator of CypB-knockdown effects. MYC knockdown also blocked proliferation and survival of glioblastoma
multiforme cells and induced morphologic changes similar to
CypB knockdown (Fig. 4J and Supplementary Fig. S3D). The
MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 (28) also reduced the survival and
proliferation of glioblastoma multiforme cells, and reduced
Jak2 expression and Stat3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4K and L). We
conclude that CypB regulates MYC expression through
enhancing its stability, an effect that is critical for glioblastoma
multiforme cell viability.

U251 cells was dependent upon endogenous MYC, because
knockdown of MYC suppressed p53 expression (Fig. 5G and
H). Mutant p53 was also suppressed by the knockdown of
Stat3 (Fig. 5G and I).
In U87 and MCF-7 cells (with wild-type p53), CypB knockdown suppressed induction of p53 and its transcriptional

target p21 by etoposide or daunorubicin (Fig. 5J; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Silencing of endogenous mutant
p53 in glioblastoma multiforme cells reduced survival,
repressed UCP2 expression, and induced ROS (Fig. 5K and
L; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Chk1 contributes to the DNA damage response and is
induced by MYC (30, 31). CypB knockdown or inhibition
reduced Chk1 expression (Fig. 5A, M, and N), as did knockdown
of MYC itself (Fig. 5O and P). Consistent with this, CypBknockdown cells were more sensitive to DNA damage induced
by daunorubicin (Fig. 5Q). These data suggest that depletion

or inhibition of CypB in glioblastoma multiforme cells causes
multiple deleterious effects due to loss of MYC, mutant p53,
Chk1, and Janus-activated kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signaling.
CypB loss causes ER stress and an abnormal unfolded
protein response
Because CypB chaperones some ER proteins (13), we asked
whether CypB knockdown might impact cells through the
unfolded protein response (UPR; ref. 32). ER tracker (Molecular
Probes; 250 nmol/L for 30 minutes) staining showed that CypBdepleted cells have increased ER content (Fig. 6A and B). CypB
silencing also induced a dot-like PDI staining pattern (Fig. 6C),
similar to thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 6C; ref. 33). HRASV12
expression in glioblastoma multiforme cells also increased
ER content (Fig. 6D) and induced similar PDI dots (Fig. 6E).
The ER stress sensor pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK; ref. 32) was also increased in CypB-depleted cells
(Fig. 6F), HRASV12-expressing cells (Fig. 6H and I), and by
treatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin (Fig. 6J). Induction
of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), but not BiP, by thapsigargin or eeyarestatin was impaired following CypB knockdown (Fig. 6G).
CypB-knockdown cells were more easily killed by thapsigargin (Fig. 6K). Tunicamycin also increased susceptibility of glioblastoma multiforme cells to CsA dimer cytotoxicity (Fig. 6L).
Calculation of the combination index and isobologram analysis indicated a true synergistic interaction of CsA dimer with
thapsigargin or tunicamycin (Supplementary Fig. S4).
CypB targeting in primary human glioblastoma
multiforme cells
Knockdown or inhibition of CypB decreased the viability of
primary human glioblastoma multiforme cells from freshly
isolated human glioblastoma multiforme xenografts passaged
in nude mice (Fig. 7A and D–G), and reduced Stat3 and Erk
activation in response to OSM (Fig. 7B). Cyclophilin inhibitors
reduced Chk1, mutant p53, and Skp2 expression (Fig. 7C).
Inhibition of CypB killed both primary (22RG and 79RG) as
well as temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant recurrent glioblastoma
multiforme cells (22TMZ and 79TMZ; Fig. 7H and I).
Rembrandt database inspection revealed that overall survival
was better in patients with glioma with lower CypB expression
in their tumors (Fig. 7J), in part due to highest levels in
glioblastoma multiformes, which have the worst prognosis.
Among astrocytoma cases, higher CypB expression was associated with shorter overall survival (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Also, patients whose tumors had deletions of PPIB gene encoding CypB did better than those with PPIB ampliﬁcation (P ¼
0.0492; Supplementary Fig. S7). To determine the effect of CypB
inhibition on tumor cell growth in vivo, we implanted controlor CypB-depleted U251 cells into nude mice and measured the
rates of tumor formation. Ablation of CypB strongly suppressed
tumor formation in this xenograft model (Fig. 7K).

Discussion
Gene expression studies revealed that CypB is highly upregulated in malignancies, suggesting a widespread role in

492

folding of ER proteins to reduce ER stress, a known problem
for cancers (34, 35). Previous studies found that CypB may
support the survival of transformed cells through suppression
of ROS or by enhancing the nuclear localization of Stat3.
However, the mechanisms underlying these effects were
unclear. We report here that ablation of CypB expression in
glioblastoma multiforme cells suppresses several canonical
oncogenic signaling pathways, which cause the dramatic
induction of cellular senescence and loss of tumor cell survival
(Supplementary Fig. S8).
A key feature of CypB is its ability to sustain the expression of
MYC (Fig. 4), which is essential for many cancer cells (26). We
found that MYC induces Jak2 expression and, subsequently,
STAT3 activation (Fig. 4G). MYC knockdown increased ROS in
glioblastoma multiforme cells, thus explaining several of the
CypB-dependent phenotypes (Fig. 4H). ROS generation downstream of CypB loss was likely due to reduced UCP2 (Fig. 2J–O).
Although MYC was not known previously to regulate UCP2, we
found that knockdown of MYC decreased UCP2 mRNA by 80%
(Fig. 4I).
Chk1 loss downstream of CypB depletion (Fig. 5A and M) or
inhibition (Fig. 5N) may also be mediated via MYC, because
MYC knockdown similarly extinguished its expression (Fig.
5O). Chk1 has been proposed to be a potential target for
therapy for MYC-driven lymphomas (36). Glioblastoma multiforme cells lacking CypB were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to
death caused by the DNA damage drug daunorubicin (Fig. 5Q).
Most importantly, knockdown of MYC recapped the dramatic killing of U251 cells that we observed following CypB
knockdown (Fig. 4J). CypB knockdown affected MYC posttranscriptionally (Fig. 4D), and MYC protein was signiﬁcantly
rescued by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 4F). Clinically useful
inhibitors of MYC have been difﬁcult to develop, so our ﬁnding
that the druggable protein CypB supplies a critical level of
support for MYC in glioblastoma multiforme cells provides an
attractive approach for targeting it therapeutically.
Mutant p53 drives malignancy, as shown here (Supplementary Fig. S3C) and elsewhere (37), and we found that its
expression depends upon CypB. Although wild-type p53 and
its target p21 also required CypB for induction after DNA
damage, we note that U87 and primary glioblastoma multiforme cells that have wild-type p53 were effectively killed by
CypB knockdown.
Gene expression pattern changes in CypB-knockdown cells
were most consistent with a Ras-induced senescence signature
(Fig. 3D; ref. 21), as further demonstrated by activated Ras
expression in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Although knockdown of CypB caused a transient increase in Ras activation, not
all of its effects could be induced by exogenous expression of
activated Ras. In particular, destabilization of MYC protein was
not seen in Ras-overexpressing cells, and we attribute this to an
alternative effect of CypB loss.
CypB knockdown induced dilation of the ER and PDI
aggregation, indicators of ER stress and altered redox status
(33, 38). Although CypB suppression did not evoke BiP and
CHOP induction, it did upregulate PERK. Alteration of UPR
sensors in CypB-knockdown cells may underlie the defective
UPR response to ER stress, as evidenced by reduced CHOP in

Cyclophilin B as a Target for Malignant Gliomas

response to ER stress. Moreover, CypB knockdown rendered
cells more vulnerable to ER stress-related death (Fig. 6K–L).
CypB has a crucial role in ER protein quality control through
the removal from the ER of ERAD-LS substrates (39), consistent
with our ﬁnding of a dramatic defect in eeyarestatin-induced
CHOP. Although our results suggest that CypB regulates ER
stress and UPR signaling, further studies will be required to
deﬁne the precise molecular mechanism of regulation of the
UPR by CypB, which may involve its known interactions with
other ER chaperones, including BiP, Grp94, calnexin, and
calreticulin (14).
Cellular senescence is emerging as a fundamental mechanism of tumor suppression (40). Here, we showed that senescence is induced by disruption of the stress response machinery by targeting CypB. ER stress chaperones, including CypB,
are apparently induced during glioblastoma multiforme development, and we suspect that the increased buffering capacity
of the ER serves to counterbalance cellular stress in the
transformed cells. CypB silencing leads to suppression of
several inhibitors of senescence, including MYC and Skp2, as
well as the hyperactivation of the oncogenic RAS–MAPK
cascade. The fact that CypB silencing drives cellular senescence in the absence of p53 or p16 suggests that additional
tumor-suppressive mechanisms may be involved. Could targeting of other ER chaperones induce similar prosenescent
effects? Several secreted proteins, including interleukins and
PAI1, can contribute to senescence in different cell types (41).
Because CypB silencing induces upregulation of these secreted
proteins, evaluation of their impact on the senescence
response to inhibition of CypB will be important to study in
the future.
An additional impact of CypB silencing in glioblastoma
multiforme was development of increased ROS and oxidative
stress sensitivity. ROS are byproducts of protein oxidation
in the ER. Because perturbation of ER stress chaperones
induces oxidative stress, persistent ROS elevation, particularly in the context of a compromised ER stress response,
may initiate a vicious cycle, leading to ER collapse and cell
death (42). In addition to oxidative stress from the increased
demand of protein folding in the ER, altered metabolism in
rapidly proliferating cancer cells produces abnormally high
levels of mitochondrial ROS. Cells typically relieve these
effects of ROS by increasing production of cellular antioxidants, including reduced glutathione, thioredoxin, and
NADPH. These antioxidant programs are activated by multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including MYC and
mutant p53 (29). CypB likely constrains the mitochondrial
redox state by controlling the transcription of UCP2, which
is at least partially due to the maintained expression of
MYC and mutant p53. We conclude that CypB regulates

mitochondrial redox homeostasis in glioblastoma multiforme cells.
Our proof-of-principle study suggests that pharmacologic
inhibition of CypB induces several tumor suppressive
responses, including cell death and senescence in glioblastoma
multiforme cells. Although CypB is ubiquitously expressed,
because inhibition of CypB lacks serious systemic toxicity (13),
it is attractive as a novel molecular target for therapy for
glioblastoma multiforme. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms downstream of CypB, including modulation of p27,
mutant p53, MYC, Chk1, ROS, and Stat3, further suggest
combinatorial approaches that will have synergistic effects
on tumor cell killing, as we found when testing Stat3 inhibitors with CypB-knockdown cells. However, all cyclophilin
inhibitors tested in this study inhibit multiple isoforms of
cyclophilin encoded by different genes. It should be considered that other closely related cyclophilins serve different functions in different cellular compartments and, more importantly, have distinct roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
necrosis (15, 43). We anticipate that the development of
compounds that more speciﬁcally inhibit CypB will yield
better treatment of multiple cancer types, including brain
tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme.
