BACKGROUND. Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poor
prognosis, which is explained by the disease itself and by host-related factors.
The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic role of comorbidities

in this population.

METHODS. For this single-center, retrospective study, the authors analyzed the
outcome of 133 patients aged 70 years who received induction chemotherapy
for nonpromyelocytic AML between 1995 and 2004. Comorbidities were evaluated by using an adapted form of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).

RESULTS. The median patient age was 73 years. The CCI score was 0 for 83
patients (68%), 1 for 16 patients (13%), and >1 for 23 patients (19%). The complete remission (CR) rate was 56%, and the median overall survival was 9

months. In multivariate analysis, 4 adverse prognostic factors for CR were identified: unfavorable karyotype, leukocytosis 30 g/L, CD34 expression on leukemic
cells, and CCI >1. A score could be generated to allow the stratification of
patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with CR rates of 87%,
63%, and 37%, respectively. The risk of early mortality and the probability of survival also were different in the 3 risk groups (P ¼ .02 and P ¼ .01, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study indicated that associated comorbidities are independent factors that may influence achievement of CR in elderly
patients with AML. Such a scoring system may be useful in the prognostic
staging systems that are used to identify patients with AML who can benefit
from induction chemotherapy. Cancer 2007;109:1376–83.  2007 American

cute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common disease in individuals aged >65 years, and its poor outcome in this population
has been well established.1–4 Complete remission (CR) rates after
induction chemotherapy usually are between 29% and 57%. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are significantly
shorter in older patients compared with younger patients (<12
months and <10% at 3 years, respectively).3–9 Adverse factors that
are intrinsic to the disease itself usually create a state of chemoresistance:10–12 AML frequently evolves from prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),13 and a higher incidence of adverse chromosomal
abnormalities is encountered with less frequent favorable karyotypes.10,14 The immature phenotype of leukemic cells and expression of the multidrug resistance glycoprotein (MDR-1) also are more
common in older patients compared with younger patients.14,15

Comorbidity and Outcome of Elderly AML/Etienne et al.

Conversely, host-related factors, such as chronic
comorbid conditions, poor performance status, and
abnormal organ functions, also explain the less
favorable prognosis for elderly patients.11,16–18 It has
been demonstrated that such factors interact with
treatment strategies and posttherapeutic outcomes in
several malignancies.19–21 They are frequent in elderly patients with AML and probably contribute to
the high death rate (17–54%) observed in this population.22 The importance of host-related comorbid
conditions has recently been demonstrated clearly in
the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplantation;23
however, to date, this has not been established in elderly patients with leukemia.
We and others have demonstrated that selected
groups of elderly patients can tolerate and benefit
from intensive chemotherapy.10,24 The objective of
this single-center study was to identify pretreatment
factors, including comorbidities, which may predict
outcome in elderly patients with AML who receive
intensive chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively evaluated 133 patients aged 70
years with previously untreated, nonpromyelocytic
AML who received intensive induction chemotherapy
at our institution between January 1995 and December 2004. All patients provided written informed consent according to institutional guidelines. Intensive
induction was defined as a multiagent chemotherapy
regimen that combined daunorubicin (DNR) or idarubicin (IDA) with conventional doses of cytarabine
(ara-C).
The following parameters were recorded for the
133 patients: age, sex, World Health Organization
performance status (PS); French-American-British
category; antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD); de
novo or secondary AML; karyotype classified according to previously published criteria;25 expression of
the CD34 antigen on leukemic blasts; white blood
cell (WBC) and platelet counts; and serum lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), serum creatinine, and bilirubin levels. Comorbidities were captured retrospectively, and scores were generated by using a
previously published, adapted form of the Charlson
comorbidity index (CCI) (Table 1).23 This weighted
index takes into account the presence or absence
of several comorbid conditions and their severity.
Comorbid conditions have been defined previously.26,27

Treatment
All 133 patients received initial remission-induction
chemotherapy. All but 5 patients received a conventional anthracycline and ara-C regimen. Ara-C was
given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 daily as a continuous
intravenous infusion from Day 1 through Day 7. Anthracycline consisted of intravenous DNR 60 mg/m2
daily from Day 1 to Day 3 (n ¼ 90 patients) or IDA
8 mg/m2 daily from Day 1 to Day 5 (n ¼ 34 patients). Twelve patients who were included in the
Bordeaux-Grenoble-Marseille-Toulouse (BGMT) 95
trial received lomustine 200 mg/m2 orally on Day 1
in addition to the anthracycline/ara-C regimen. Four
patients who had a contraindication to anthracycline
received ara-C 1 g/m2 daily and topotecan 1.25 mg/
m2 daily on Days 1 through 5 as described previously.28 Patients who achieved CR after 1 or 2
cycles of induction chemotherapy proceeded to consolidation therapy, which contained DNR 45 mg/m2
on Day 1 and 2 or IDA 8 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, and 3;
and ara-C 50 mg/m2 twice daily as a subcutaneous
infusion from Day 1 to Day 5. All patients were
scheduled to receive a maintenance treatment, which
consisted of oral 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 60 mg/m2
daily and oral methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg/m2 weekly
with courses of IDA 8 mg/m2 or DNR 45 mg/m2 on
Day 1 and ara-C 50 mg/m2 twice daily between Days
1 and 5 every 3 months for a total of 12 months.29
Seven patients who were treated before 1999 received
additional consolidation with ara-C 500 mg/m2 twice
daily on Days 1 through 4 and DNR 30 mg/m2 daily
or IDA 12 mg/m2 daily on Days 5 through 7 before
maintenance. Twelve patients received high-dose
melphalan and underwent autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT) in the setting of a Phase II

trial that evaluated ASCT in elderly patients with
AML. One patient underwent a reduced-intensity
conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation
from a matched-sibling donor, and another patient
underwent a syngeneic transplantation.

Statistical Analyses
Cytogenetic categories included: 1) favorable karyotype, ie, t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inversion 16 (p13:q22)/
t(16;16)(p13:q22); 2) intermediate karyotype, ie, normal or abnormalities not observed in the favorable
and unfavorable groups; 3) unfavorable karyotype, ie,
deletion 5q/5, or deletion 7q/7, or 11q23 rearrangements or complex karyotype (3 abnormalities).
Response to induction chemotherapy was evaluated
by using National Cancer Institute criteria.30 The 8week mortality rate was assessed as reported previously by Kantarjian et al.6 Data were summarized
by frequency and percentage for categorical variables. For continuous variables, the medians and
ranges were computed. Results are presented with
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical tests
were 2-sided at the 5% level of significance. To investigate the association between continuous variables
and categorical variables, univariate analysis was performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum
test or the Kruskall-Wallis rank-sum test when appropriate. Survival rates were estimated by using the
Kaplan-Meier method.31 OS was defined as the time
from the date of AML diagnosis until death from any
cause, and observation ended at the date of last contact for patients last known to be alive. DFS was
defined by the time from the date of CR to recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. Patients
without events were censored at the time of last follow-up. Changes in the relative risk of events according to prognostic factors were assessed by using the
Cox proportional-hazards regression models32 in univariate and multivariate analyses.
Multivariate analysis for CR was performed
by using a logistic regression model to obtain the
probability of CR according to different variables.
Regression models were built with a backward-stepwise selection procedure of variables to minimize the
Akaike information criterion.33 Statistical analyses
were performed by using the R.2.3.0. software package
(R Development Core Team).

85 years). It is noteworthy that 51 patients (38%)
were aged 75 years. In all, these patients displayed
the usual characteristics of elderly AML populations,
including a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group PS (2 in 46 patients; 40%), frequent AHD or
prior myelodysplasia in 36 patients (27%), multilineage dysplasia in 37 patients (30%), unfavorable
karyotypes in 26 patients (20%), and expression of
CD34 on blast cells in 60 patients (53%).
Comorbid conditions included cardiac comorbidities in 47 patients (hypertension, n ¼ 34 patients;
angina, n ¼ 12 patients; myocardial infarction, n ¼ 5
patients; and heart failure, n ¼ 4 patients), diabetes
in 12 patients, other malignancies in 11 patients, pulmonary comorbidities in 9 patients, and renal
comorbidities in 5 patients. Ninety-nine patients
(81%) had low comorbidity scores at diagnosis.

FIGURE 1. Overall survival. AML indicates acute myeloid leukemia.
Response to Treatment
Seventy-five patients achieved CR (56%), including 11
patients who achieved CR after 2 courses of induction
therapy. The CR rate was not influenced significantly by
the type of anthracycline used (65% for patients who
received IDA; 56% for patients who received DNR;
P ¼ .36). Thirty-five patients (26%) had leukemia resistance to induction chemotherapy, and 23 patients (17%)
died during induction. Most of the deaths that were
recorded during induction were caused by infections
(n ¼ 10 deaths; 43%). Among the 75 patients who
achieved CR, 6 patients (8%) who did not recover from
induction toxicity could not receive subsequent consolidation chemotherapy (1 of those patients died in CR).
Overall, 66 patients were able to receive a consolidation
course. After consolidation, 45 patients (69%) received
reinduction/oral maintenance (including 7 patients
who received an additional consolidation course), 12
patients (18%) underwent ASCT, 2 patients (3%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and 7
patients (11%) did not receive any additional treatment.
The median overall follow-up was 57 months.
Fifty-five patients developed recurrent disease after a
median CR duration of 9 months (range, 1–72
months). The median OS was 9 months (95% CI, 6–
13 months) (Fig. 1). Only 15 patients (11%) survived
beyond 36 months, and the median DFS was 13
months (95% CI, 10–18 months).

Pretreatment Characteristics Associated With Outcome
In univariate analysis, we observed a significant
association between a worse CR rate and hyperleuko-

1379

cytosis 30 G/L, CCI >1, unfavorable karyotype, and
CD34 expression (Table 3). The multivariate analysis
confirmed that these effects were independent prognostic parameters (Table 4). We did not observe any
significant difference in the CR rate or in CR duration (median, 13 months; range, 10–18 months)
according to age. Each factor described above was
associated with equivalent relative risks of CR
between 0.29 and 0.37 (Table 4). To build a global
model, we assigned a score of 1 to each adverse
prognostic variable versus 0 when the factor was
absent. For cytogenetics, scores of 0, 1, or 2 were
assigned to the favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable categories, respectively. One-hundred four
patients who were assessable for the 4 prognostic
factors could be stratified into 3 distinct prognostic
groups for the achievement of CR, as shown in Table
5. The risk of early mortality and the probability of
survival also differed statistically within the 3 risk
groups (P ¼ .02 and P ¼ .01, respectively), as shown
in Table 5 and in Figure 2.
We observed that OS was statistically lower in
patients with leukocytes 30 G/L and serum creatinine levels >1.5 3 normal in both univariate (Table
3) and multivariate analyses. The 8-week mortality
was higher in patients with leukocytes counts 30 G/L,
no multilineage dysplasia, heart failure, and serum
LDH levels >1.5 3 normal in univariate analyses (Table 3). However, only elevated serum LDH retained
statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.
Finally, we did not identify any factors that were
associated significantly with DFS.

Validation of the Previously Described Prognostic Model
In the recent study by Kantarjian et al.,6 patients
aged 65 years with AML who received induction
chemotherapy could be separated into 3 groups
according to the presence or absence of the following
pretreatment adverse factors: age 75 years, unfavorable karyotype, treatment outside the laminar airflow room, AHD 12 months, PS >2, LDH >600 IU/L,
and creatinine >1.3 mg/dL. These factors were associated with lower CR and survival rates and with
higher 8-week mortality rates. Among the 96 patients
from our series who could be evaluated for those
7 factors, 10 patients (10%) had no adverse factors,
69 patients (72%) had 1 or 2 adverse factors, and
17 patients (18%) had 3 adverse factors. The 8-week
mortality differed significantly between the 3 groups,
with rates of 11%, 20%, and 47%, respectively
(P ¼ .02), demonstrating the validity of the scoring
system published by Kantarjian et al. in our series.
We have not been able to determine any differences
in terms the CR rates (50%, 68%, and 41%, respec-

small number of patients who could be included in
the analysis.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that high WBC counts,
unfavorable karyotype, expression of CD34, and
comorbidities (CCI >1) are independent predictors

of CR in elderly patients with AML who receive intensive induction chemotherapy. We were able to
generate a score that stratified patients into 3 risk
groups. Patients in the high-risk category had a 37%
CR rate, a 34% 8-week mortality rate, and a 2-year
survival estimate of 15%. Thus, our risk-stratification
system may allow the identification of patients who
should not be recommended for induction chemotherapy. Alternative approaches, including investigational studies, may be proposed for these patients.

Recently, Kantarjian et al.6 described several adverse factors associated with a low CR rate, short survival, and a high 8-week mortality rate in a large series
of elderly patients who received induction chemotherapy for AML. It is noteworthy that several parameters
identified by those authors, such as cytogenetics, LDH,
serum creatinine, and leukocytosis, were of prognostic
significance in our series. In addition, the scoring system proposed by Kantarjian et al. correctly predicted
8-week mortality in our series. The validation of their
model in a group of patients who were treated at
another institution demonstrates its robustness.
In the current study, we also evaluated comorbidities and showed that they have an independent
prognostic impact, as observed previously in cancer
patients.34 The CCI is the most commonly used
comorbidity index. It was designed initially to assess
the role of comorbidities on mortality risks in
longitudinal studies and to correlate with outcomes in various situations, including breast cancer,26 postoperative complications,35 older cancer
patients,19–21,34,36 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.23 For this study, we used an adapted ver-

sion of the CCI established by Sorror and
collegues23,37 that was validated in patients with hematologic malignancies. Although it may have
increased the sensitivity of the CCI, we did not use
the recently revised version of that score,38 because
we were not able to capture retrospectively many parameters that were used in the revised index. Therefore, the CCI version used in the current study may
have missed the extraction of some comorbid conditions, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, because
of a high positive threshold.
The prognostic model described in this report
has been established in a series of patients who were
deemed fit to receive induction chemotherapy. This
selection has contributed to an underestimation of
the proportion of patients with a CCI >1 in the
whole elderly population. The current study group
represented approximately 40% of patients with AML
aged >70 years who were admitted to our hospital
during the same period. Among the remaining
patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy, 53% could be classified in the high-risk group
using the same scoring method (data not shown).
This indicates that the frequency of patients in the
high-risk group, ie, the patients for whom intensive
chemotherapy should not be recommended, is
higher than the 37% observed in the study group.
In conclusion, the current study highlights the
importance of comorbidity evaluation for treatment
algorithms in elderly patients with AML. The stratification system proposed here may represent a useful
tool for selecting those patients who are eligible for
