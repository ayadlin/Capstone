BACKGROUND: Extranodal involvement is considered a poor prognostic factor for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL); however, the prognostic impact of specific sites of involvement has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 1221 patients treated uniformly with standard R-CHOP therapy between 2003 and 2006. Patients with distinct
forms of DLBCL such as intravascular lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, pyothorax-associated lymphoma, primary central
nervous system lymphoma, and intraocular lymphoma were also excluded. The authors evaluated 26 extranodal sites of involvement
with respect to prognostic impact. The median age was 64 years (range, 15-91 years). RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that
patients with involvement of specific extranodal sites had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than did patients without such
involvement; these sites included nasal cavity, paranasal sinus, lung, pleura, small intestine, peritoneum, liver, pancreas, stomach,
spleen, adrenal gland, testis, bone, bone marrow, peripheral blood, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Patients with Waldeyer ring involvement had significantly better OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with the involvement of the pleura (P < .001), small
intestine (P ¼ .015), peritoneum (P ¼ .002), adrenal gland (P < .001), testis (P ¼ .005), bone marrow (P < .001), and peripheral blood
(P ¼ .002) had significantly worse OS, whereas those with Waldeyer ring involvement had significantly better OS (P ¼ .038).
Subgroup analysis with the nodal and/or Waldeyer patient group also showed prognostic impact of Waldeyer ring by multivariate
analysis (relative risk, 0.3; P ¼ .04). CONCLUSIONS: Extranodal involvement affects the prognosis of patients undergoing R-CHOP

INTRODUCTION
Involvement of >1 extranodal site in non-Hodgkin lymphoma is known to be a poor prognostic factor according to the
International Prognostic Index (IPI).1 Recently, rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody product, has been added
to conventional CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vincristine, and prednisolone) to
form R-CHOP, which is widely accepted as the standard therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.2 Although the prognosis
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is improved by the addition of rituximab, extranodal involvement is still
considered a poor prognostic factor by revised IPI (R-IPI).3 The prognostic impact of each involvement site has not yet

been fully elucidated. The present study is a multicenter
retrospective analysis of patients with DLBCL who underwent treatment with R-CHOP therapy.

Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Diffuse Large B-Cell
Lymphoma Patients (N¼1221)

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 47
institutions regarding 1221 patients with CD20-positive
DLBCL treated with R-CHOP therapy. All patients
in this study were initially targeted to receive survey
information from Bay-LINK (Bay-area Lymphoma
Information Network) in Japan regarding central nervous system (CNS) events.4 Data were collected by mail
and e-mail for this purpose from October 2009 to June
2010. The data included patient data at diagnosis (IPIrelated data and presence/absence of each extranodal
site), treatment (reduction of each drug, cycles of
CHOP, addition of irradiation), and survival data (overall survival [OS], cause of death). This study was in
addition approved by the Yokohama City University
Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Board. The procedure
for this study was in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration.
All patients were diagnosed with DLBCL, and
they received primary therapy between September
2003 and December 2006. Rituximab use in Japan
began in September 2003, when it was approved for
the treatment of aggressive CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma. Patients with distinct forms of DLBCL such
as intravascular lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma,
and pyothorax-associated lymphoma were excluded
from the study. Patients with primary CNS lymphoma
or intraocular lymphoma and patients who received
any CNS prophylactic treatment such as intrathecal
chemotherapy, intravenous high-dose methotrexate, or
whole-brain irradiation were also excluded. Pathological
diagnosis was made by the pathologists at each institution; review of the diagnoses was not performed for
this study.
The schedule for drug dosing in R-CHOP therapy
was as follows: 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin on day 1; 750 mg/m2
cyclophosphamide on day 1; 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum
2.0 mg/body) vincristine on day 1; 100 mg/body prednisolone on days 1 to 5; and 375 mg/m2 rituximab per
3-week cycle. All patients received at least 1 cycle of
R-CHOP therapy with curative intent. Age, sex, clinical
stage (according to the Ann Arbor staging system), serum
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, performance status,
presence/absence of bulky mass or B symptoms, R-IPI,
and number of extranodal involvement sites were
recorded. Clinical stage was determined by physical

initiation to the date of the last follow-up or death from
any cause. Survival analysis was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. P values
<.05 indicated statistical significance. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model, including
all sites with P < .1 from the univariate analysis, was
performed to determine the impact of each extranodal
involvement. Clinical parameters are not included in the
analysis. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (PASW Statistics 18.0; SPSS,
Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

The median age was 64 years, with a range of 15 to 91
years. Patient characteristics, including the 5 risk factors
used in R-IPI determination, are listed in Table 1.
According to the R-IPI, 433 patients (35.2%) were
included in the poor risk group (3 risk factors). Of the
1221 patients, 910 (74.6%) were treated with 6 to 8 cycles
of therapy. Local radiation therapy was added in 297
patients (24.4%).
The OS for the entire cohort of 1221 patients is
depicted in Figure 1A. The median observation period in
surviving patients was 47.9 months. The 5-year OS rate
was 75.0%. R-IPI scores clearly stratified the 3 risk groups
of this cohort (P < .001; Fig. 1B). The 5-year OS for the
very good, good, and poor groups was 95.6%, 84.0%,
and 53.5%, respectively. Patients with >1 extranodal site
had a significantly poorer prognosis (5-year OS, 54.2%)
than those with fewer extranodal sites (80.2%; P < .001;
Fig. 1C).

Analysis of Extranodal Sites

The 26 extranodal involvement sites were evaluated by
univariate analysis for associations with OS. Nineteen
sites with a P value of <.1 are shown in Table 2. Sites associated with decreased OS (P < .05) are the nasal cavity,
paranasal sinus, lung, pleura, small intestine, peritoneum,
liver, pancreas, stomach, spleen, adrenal gland, testis,
bones, bone marrow, peripheral blood, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Patients with Waldeyer ring involvement
had significantly better OS than did those without.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis of 19 risk factors (those with a P value of <.1 by univariate analysis)
revealed that patients with involvement of pleura (relative
risk [RR], 2.4), small intestine (RR, 1.7), peritoneum
(RR, 2.0), adrenal gland (RR, 6.5), testis (RR, 3.6), bone
marrow (RR, 2.4), and peripheral blood (RR, 2.6) had
significantly worse OS; patients with Waldeyer ring
involvement had significantly higher OS (RR, 0.6).
Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meyer survival curves for OS in
patients with and without extranodal involvement.
Although testicular involvement was analyzed only in
male patients (n ¼ 639), it still had significant prognostic
impact.
We also excluded patients with extranodal involvement other than Waldeyer ring from our cohort and performed additional analysis to detect factors associated
with the improved OS seen in the former. Baseline characteristics of those 485 patients are shown in Table 3. The
Waldeyer group had significantly low stage and serum
LDH. We compared survival between nodal versus
Waldeyer lymphoma. Univariate analysis showed
significantly better OS in patients with Waldeyer ring

analysis, Waldeyer ring involvement was also a better prognosis factor along with IPI factors (RR, 0.3; P ¼ .04; Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Of the cohort of 1221 adult patients with DLBCL,
67.9% showed extranodal involvement in at least 1 site.
Although patients with CNS involvement or those who

received CNS prophylaxis were excluded, our patient
cohort was well stratified by R-IPI. Because OS of each
group was also similar to that in the original report of
R-IPI by Sehn et al (94%, 79%, 55%, P < .001),3 in

extranodal sites.

which none of the DLBCL subtypes in our criteria was
excluded, the DLBCL patient cohort in our study had a
similar distribution in prognosis to the entire DLBCL
cohort. We also chose patients who were treated only with
standard R-CHOP therapy, to eliminate the influence of
other therapeutic factors. Because we aimed to detect the
prognostic impact of the presence/absence of each extranodal site in this study, primary or secondary lymphoma
was not distinguished. Also, because we intended to evaluate prognosis of DLBCL patients treated only with RCHOP, we excluded patients who received CNS prophylaxis, which may cause survival prolongation by suppressing occurrence of CNS involvement.
We identified 8 extranodal sites that have an impact
on prognosis, 7 of which are associated with a poor prognosis. Lymphomas with involvement in these sites reportedly tend toward advanced stages,5-11 whether defined as
primary sites or not. Patients with extranodal involvement
of these sites in our cohort also tended to have disseminated disease. Besides, DLBCL with testicular involvement tends to extend to and relapse in other extranodal
sites, including the CNS and contralateral testis.10,11 Presence of the blood-brain and blood-testicular barriers
blocks the access of chemotherapy to lesions in these areas,
reducing its efficacy and leading to a poor prognosis. In
our recent study with the same patient cohort,4 adrenal as
well as testicular involvement was extracted as a risk factor

for CNS involvement by multivariate analysis, which
seemed to be a cause of poorer OS for patients with either
of these 2 extranodal involvements. As for the proportion
of CNS prophylaxis, we12 have reported 407 consecutive
DLBCL patients in our group with respect to CNS
involvement, and only 7.1% (29 of 407) of the cases
received CNS prophylaxis. Although patients with CNS
prophylaxis excluded from this study would not be a large
population, selection bias might exist.
Interestingly, Waldeyer ring involvement in this
cohort was associated with improved survival, whereas
extranodal involvement itself generally worsens survival.
Lopez-Guillermo et al13 also observed a positive prognostic impact of Waldeyer ring involvement on DLBCL
before rituximab use. Consistent with our data, these
patients were found to have significantly limited disease,
better performance status, and fewer B symptoms. Waldeyer ring involvement can be visible and produces noticeable symptoms, which may contribute to early
detection of the disease. Conversely, Qi et al14 reported
similarly improved prognosis for Waldeyer ring involvement with nodal DLBCL, suggesting that the Waldeyer
ring should be managed as a nodal lesion with no prognostic impact in itself. As their study included cases
treated before the use of rituximab, it does not truly reflect
the prognostic impact of Waldeyer ring involvement with
rituximab treatment. Our data suggest that Waldeyer ring
involvement should be treated as an extranodal lesion in
terms of prognostic impact in the rituximab era.
Although this is a retrospective study, our patient
cohort is large enough to have statistical significance, suggesting that the 8 extranodal sites indicated in our data
might be considered as useful prognostic factors in the
clinical setting.
