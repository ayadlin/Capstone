ABSTRACT
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the first-line chemotherapeutic agents for the
treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies, has shown limited efficacy. The expression
of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) has been reported to be associated with the resistance
to 5-FU. Here, we demonstrate that the enhanced HSP90 function and subsequent
activation of Src induce expression of TYMS and acquired resistance to 5-FU in
colon cancer. We show that the persistent 5-FU treatment granted 5-FU-sensitive
HCT116 colon cancer cells morphologic, molecular, and behavioral characteristic
of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to emergence of
acquired resistance to 5-FU. HCT116/R, a HCT116 colon cancer cell subline carrying
acquired resistance to 5-FU, showed increased expression and activation of HSP90’s
client proteins and transcriptional up-regulation of TYMS. Forced overexpression
of HSP90 or constitutive active Src in HCT116 cells increased TYMS expression.
Conversely, pharmacological blockade of HSP90 or Src in HCT116/R cells effectively
suppressed the changes involved in 5-FU resistance in vitro and xenograft tumor
growth, hematogenous spread, and metastatic tumor development in vivo. This study
suggests a novel function of HSP90-Src pathway in regulation of TYMS expression and
acquisition of 5-FU resistance. Thus, therapeutics targeting this pathway may be an
effective clinical strategy to overcome 5-FU resistance in colon cancer.

several client oncoproteins, such as Src, ErbB2, Akt, and
Raf, from proteosomal degradation [8].
Among resistance mechanisms reported so far,
TYMS is known to play a central role in 5-FU resistance.
Tumors with elevated TYMS have highly proliferative
and metastatic characteristics [9, 10]. 5-FU sensitivity and
patients’ survival have been inversely related to the level
of TYMS protein and enzymatic activity in cancer cells,
and 5-FU-resistant tumors commonly express high levels
of TYMS protein [11]. Previous results have demonstrated
that Src modulates TYMS expression [8, 12]. However, the
detailed mechanisms underlying resistance to 5-FU and
regulation of TYMS expression remain to be elucidated.
This study was performed to investigate the
mechanism by which TYMS expression is regulated and
colon cancer cells become resistant to 5-FU. We show that
increased HSP90 function after chronic exposure to 5-FU

INTRODUCTION
The antimetabolite drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
is widely used in the treatment of numerous cancers,
including colorectal cancer [1]. 5-FU inhibits cancer
cell growth by disrupting action of thymidylate synthase
(TYMS), thereby causing DNA and RNA damage.
Nonetheless, response rates to 5-FU are only 10 to 15%
in colorectal cancer [2], and combination with other
anti-cancer drugs, such as cetuximab, cisplatin and
oxaliplatin, has improved response rates to 5-FU [1, 3–5].
Multiple mechanisms, including acquisition of epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been known to play
a role in 5-FU resistance [1, 6, 7]. Histone deacetylase was
also found to contribute to 5-FU resistance by increasing
acetylation of HSP90, a key chaperone protein protecting

leads to Src activation, resulting in induction of genotypic
and phenotypic changes involved in the EMT, induction
of TYMS expression, and 5-FU resistance in colon cancer
cells. More importantly, treatment with clinically available
inhibitors targeting Src or HSP90 was found to suppress
primary tumor growth, circulation in the blood, and
metastatic tumor development of 5-FU-resistant cancer
cells in vivo. Our results suggest potential clinical benefit
of targeting HSP90 or Src in colon cancer patients who
acquired resistance to 5-FU-based therapeutic regimens.

we found greater levels of TYMS mRNA and protein
expressions in HCT116/R cells than in HCT116/P
cells (Figure 4A). We then assessed the mechanisms
underlying increased levels of TYMS expression along
with acquisition of EMT phenotypes and 5-FU resistance
in HCT116/R cells. Because the EMT process can be
regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth
factors [14], we analyzed the activation status of several
kinases and their effectors involved in cancer cell
proliferation and survival, including EGFR, IGF-1R,
Src, FAK, Akt, Erk1/2, mTOR, MEK1/2, and p70S6K.
Compared to HCT116/P cells, HCT116/R cells were
found to have increased expression and phosphorylation
of EGFR, IGF-1R, Src, and Akt (Figure 4B). Increased
phosphotylations of Erk, mTOR, and p70S6K were also
detected in HCT116/R cells compared to their parental
cells. Notably, mRNA levels of EGFR, IGF-1R, Src,
Akt, and mTOR remained unchanged in HCT116/R cells
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Based on the given role of the molecular chaperone
HSP90 in the stability of EGFR, IGF-1R, Src, and
Akt proteins, we reasoned that HSP90 function might
be involved in increased levels of these proteins in
HCT116/R cells. Indeed, HCT116/R cells revealed an
increased half-life of HSP90 client proteins, including
EGFR, IGF-1R, and Src proteins (Figure 4C). Because Src
activity was found to regulate TYMS transcription [12],
we further hypothesized that increased HSP90 function
and subsequent activation of Src could have contributed
to TYMS expression in HCT116/R cells. Indeed, forced
HSP90 overexpression led to increased levels of TYMS,
Src and pSrc expressions in HCT cells (Figure 4D, left).
Conversely, treatment of HCT116/R cells with the HSP90
inhibitor 17-AAG induced a transcriptional decrease in
TYMS expression (Figure 4E, left). Moreover, activation of
Src by transfection with constitutively active Src (Y527F)
resulted in FAK activation along with a transcriptional
increase in TYMS in HCT116/P cells (Figure 4D, right).
Conversely, treatment with dasatinib, a Src inhibitor
decreased TYMS expression in HCT116/R cells (Figure
4E, right). Considering that dasatinib inhibits a wide
variety of tyrosine kinases [15], we induced knockdown
of Src by using siRNA to show the direct impact of this
kinase in regulating TYMS expression. Upon knockdown
of Src expression, TYMS expression was also decreased in
HCT116/R cells (Figure 4F), supporting that Src regulates
the TYMS expression. Additionally, pharmacological
inhibitors of Akt (LY294002) or EGFR (erlotinib) also
decreased the expression of TYMS in HCT116/R cells
(Supplementary Figure S2). Inhibition of HSP90 or
Src increased transcription of E-cadherin (Figure 4E),
indicating that induction of EMT in resistant cells was
originated from increased HSP90 and Src activities. These
findings suggest that activation of the HSP90-mediated
Src signaling pathway was stimulated in HCT116/R cells,
resulting in increase of TYMS expression.

RESULTS
In vitro selection of colon cancer cells with
acquired 5-FU resistance
We selected 5-FU-sensitive HCT116 human colon
cancer cells based on the results from a (3-[4,5-dimethyl­
thiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay (Figure 1A). We established a subline of HCT116
cells carrying acquired resistance to 5-FU by treating the
cell line with increasing concentrations of 5-FU over a
period of more than 6 months. Compared to the parental
cells (HCT116/P), resistant cells (HCT116/R) exhibited
minimal change in anchorage-dependent (Figure 1B) and
-independent (Figure 1C) colony forming abilities but
significantly greater migration (Figure 1D) and invasion
(Figure 1E).
Notably, HCT116/P cells exhibited a cobblestonelike morphology with tight cell–cell junctions, whereas
HCT116/R cells displayed spindle-like and elongated
fibroblastic cell morphology with loss of intercellular
adhesion and increased pseudopodia (Figure 2A).
Immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2B), Western
blotting (Figure 2C), and RT-PCR analysis (Figure 2D)
revealed that HCT116/R cells exhibited reduced
E-cadherin and increased β-catenin and TGF-β1
expression. Collectively these results suggest that EMT is
related to acquisition of resistance to 5-FU.
We next tested the effects of 5-FU on HCT116/P and
HCT116/R cells. Following 5-FU treatment, HCT116/R
cells exhibited significantly greater viability (Figure 3A),
anchorage-dependent (Figure 3B), -independent colony
formation (Figure 3C), migration and invasion (Figure
3D) compared with the parental cells. 5-FU-induced
apoptosis was also blocked in HCT116/R cells as
determined by annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) double
staining (Figure 3E) and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) (Figure 3F).

HSP90 or Src blockade would effectively suppress growth,
migration, and invasion of 5-FU resistant colon cancer
cells. Akt inhibition by the LY294002 treatment also
suppressed colony forming ability, viability, and migration
with minimal benefit in enhancing antitumor activities
of 5-FU in HCT116/R cells. (Supplementary Figure S3).
These results imply that HCT116/R cells are dependent on
HSP90 function for various tumor activities.
To investigate the impact of HSP90 and Src in innate
resistance in colon cancer cells, we compared basal levels
of target proteins of HSP90 in HCT116, RKO, HT-29, and
SW480 cells. Among those cell lines, SW480 cells, the
most resistant cell line according to Figure 1A, showed the
strongest expression of Src and Akt proteins (Supplementary
Figure S4A). When Src was targeted by dasatinib treatment,
viability of SW480 cells remained unaffected. In contrast,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combined treatment with 5-FU and dasatinib significantly
enhanced the inhibitory effects of 5-FU on the viability
of SW480 cells (Supplementary Figure S4B). This data
suggest that HSP90/Src pathway is implicated in the innate
resistance to 5-FU in colon cancer cells.
To explore the effects of HSP90 and Src
antagonism on tumor growth and metastatic tumor
development in vivo, we performed renal capsule
implantation of GFP-labeled HCT116/R cells. We
have previously shown that HCT116/R cells implanted
under the renal capsule induced an obvious increase in
the number of circulating tumor cells within 5 weeks,
leading to metastatic tumor growth [16]. We observed a
statistically significant difference in volume (Figure 6A)
and weight (Figure 6B) of the primary tumors between
the vehicle- and each inhibitor-treated groups. Tumor

DISCUSSION

using a 5-FU sensitive parental cell line (HCT116/P)
and its subline (HCT116/R) with acquired resistance to
5-FU. The increased migratory and invasive potential and
morphological alterations observed in HCT116/R cells are
typical characteristics of the EMT, which contributes to the
emergence of cancer stem cells and drug resistance [17].
Therefore, it can be suggested that induction of EMT results
in 5-FU resistant phenotype in HCT116 cells. We also show

Because 5-FU still remains the agent of choice in the
treatment of GI tract cancers, identifying key pathways that
cause 5-FU resistance and developing effective therapeutic
strategies for the patients who acquired resistance against
5-FU-based therapies are of vital importance. In the current
study, we show potential mechanisms of 5-FU-resistance

TYMS protein via HSP90 acetylation [8]. Moreover, HSP90targeting small molecule inhibitor, ganetespib, was shown to
downregulate TYMS, thus sensitizing colorectal cancer cell
line to 5-FU [30]. These previous reports and our in vitro
findings from the current study, including 1) increase in
HSP90 level or constitutive activation of Src increase TYMS
expression and 2) pharmacologic suppression of HSP90 or
Src decreases TYMS mRNA and protein expression suggest
that up-regulation of TYMS expression in HCT116/R cells
were through enhanced HSP90 and Src activities and might
be a fundamental mechanism by which colon cancer cells
acquired EMT phenotypes and 5-FU resistance. In support
of the notion, pharmacologic suppression of Src or HSP90
abolished TYMS expression, colony forming abilities,
potentials of migration and invasion and induces apoptosis in
HCT116/R cells. This conclusion was further supported by our
in vivo findings using the xenograft and renal capsule tumors
established in nude mice that HSP90 or Src antagonism alone
was sufficient to suppress HCT116/R cells’ primary tumor
growth, hematogenous spread, and distal metastatic potential.
Interestingly, co-treatment with HSP90 or Src
inhibitor showed no benefit to enhance 5-FU sensitivity.
This can be explained by the fact that decreased TYMS
upon 17-AAG or dasatinib is a target of 5-FU. Although
5-FU does not decrease the protein level, it inhibits the
function of TYMS, and this also obtained by reducing the
protein expression using 17-AAG and dasatinib. As the final
effects of these inhibitors are same and activated HSP90
and Src in resistant cell line, single treatment of 17-AAG
or dasatinib is enough to overcome the resistance to 5-FU.
In conclusion, this study identifies transcriptional
overexpression of TYMS through the activation of an
HSP90–Src signaling module as a novel mechanism for
acquired resistance to 5-FU. Therefore, targeted inactivation
of HSP90 and Src with clinically available inhibitors might
be translated into the clinics for the patients with 5-FU
resistance. In this context, our findings have therapeutic
impact considering ongoing clinical development of
HSP90 and Src inhibitors. Further clinical investigations are
warranted to investigate whether such therapeutic regimens
are effective in patients with 5-FU–resistant colorectal
cancers. In addition, the exploration of detailed mechanisms
underlying Src-mediated TYMS regulation are warranted.

that HSP90-dependent Src activation plays a key role in
the changes observed in HCT116/R cells. We finally show
that HSP90 and Src antagonism are highly effective in
suppressing TYMS expression and primary tumor growth,
dissemination in circulation, and metastatic tumor formation
of the HCT116/R cells. Based on these results, we propose
that HSP90-dependent Src activation after chronic exposure
to 5-FU causes increase in TYMS expression in both mRNA
and protein levels, leading to 5-FU resistance. A model of
how chronic exposure to 5-FU leads to increase in TYMS
expression and drug resistance is described in Figure 6F.
These findings indentify a previously unrecognized role of
HSP90-mediated Src activation in TYMS expression and
acquired resistance to 5-FU in colon cancer.
HCT116/R cells revealed several molecular and
behavioral changes associated with EMT, including
(a)  formation of spindle-shaped cells and pseudopodia;
(b) transcriptional regulation of representative markers;
(c) enhanced invasive and migratory activities; and (d)
increased expression, stability and/or activation of several
HSP90 client proteins (Src, EGFR, IGF-1R, and Akt) and
their downstream signaling mediators (FAK, Erk1/2 and
mTOR) along with increased level of TYMS expression.
HCT116/R cells appeared to have markedly increased
levels of Src activity through enhanced function of HSP90.
Those changes suggest that chronic 5-FU exposure selected
resistant cells which acquire survival mechanism through
activation of oncogenic signaling molecule, including Src.
This is in line with previous discussions that resistance of
therapy occurs by killing sensitive cells and sparing mutant
cells that are resistant [18–20]. Studies have identified a role
of extracellular HSP90 and Src in driving EMT, a key step
implicated in metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and various molecularly targeted therapies
in diverse preclinical models [21–25]. Previous studies also
suggest that Src may induce 5-FU resistance by interfering
with several signaling molecules, including PI3K, Akt, and
NF-κB [26, 27]. Moreover, HSP90 inhibitors exhibited a
potent anti-proliferative effect in various 5-FU-resistant
prostate cancer cells [28]. Our findings are relevant to and
extend these earlier reports that identify roles for HSP90
and Src in driving EMT and 5-FU resistance [8, 12, 21, 22].
Therefore, it was likely that 5-FU resistance emerged at
least in part by EMT through enhanced HSP90 function and
subsequent increases in multiple oncogenic HSP90 client
proteins. Hence, targeting HSP90 or Src could be clinically
available strategies to overcome 5-FU chemoresistance.
Notably, increased TYMS expression was detected in
HCT116/R cells compared to HCT116/P cells. TYMS, which
is involved in the metabolic process of 5-FU has been shown to
mediate 5-FU resistance and predict prognosis of patients with
colon cancer [29]. It was previously reported that inactivation
of Src kinase could revert chemoresistance to TYMS-targeting
anticancer drugs [12]. Histone deacetylase inhibition was also
found to reverse 5-FU resistance by decreasing TYMS mRNA
expression and by inducing proteasomal degradation of the
