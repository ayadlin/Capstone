BACKGROUND. Recently, the authors reported improved time to disease progression (TTP) with a combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and
bortezomib compared with bortezomib alone in a phase 3 randomized trial in
patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In the current analysis, they determined 1) the efficacy of PLD plus bortezomib versus bortezomib
alone in patients with MM who had failed on prior thalidomide/lenalidomide
(immunomodulatory drug [IMiD]) treatment and 2) the efficacy and safety profile
of PLD plus bortezomib in IMiD-exposed and IMiD-naive patients.

METHODS. This prespecified analysis included 646 patients who were randomized
to receive either PLD with bortezomib (n 5 324; 194 IMiD-naive patients and

130 IMiD-exposed patients) or bortezomib alone (n 5 322; 184 IMiD-naive
patients and 138 IMiD-exposed patients). The primary efficacy endpoint was TTP,
and secondary endpoints included overall survival, response rate, and safety.

RESULTS. The median TTP was significantly longer with PLD plus bortezomib
compared with bortezomib alone in IMiD-exposed patients (270 days vs 205
days). No statistical difference was noted with respect to TTP between IMiD-naive
(295 days) versus IMiD-exposed (270 days) subgroups who received PLD plus bortezomib. A sustained trend favoring combination therapy was observed in analyses of overall survival. In patients who achieved a response, the response
duration was comparable for IMiD-naive patients and IMiD-exposed patients in
the combination treatment group and lasted a median of 310 days and 319 days,
respectively. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was similar with PLD plus
bortezomib regardless of prior IMiD exposure.

CONCLUSIONS. A significantly prolonged TTP was observed with combined PLD
plus bortezomib combination therapy compared with bortezomib alone despite
prior IMiD exposure. For the combination treatment arm in the IMiD-naive and
IMiD-exposed subgroups, TTP was comparable. Similarly, the safety profile of the
PLD plus bortezomib combination was unaltered by prior IMiD exposure. Cancer

outcomes further through the development of new
combination regimens. Examples of newer agents
include immunomodulatory drugs5–7 (IMiDs), such
as thalidomide and lenalidomide, new formulations
of doxorubicin with improved cardiac safety8 (such
as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD]), and proteasome inhibitors (such as bortezomib).
Although these new treatments provide improved
safety and patient convenience, there still is room for
improvement in the rates of overall and complete
response (CR), and regimens combining these novel
agents with more traditional chemotherapeutic
agents (or with each other) have been suggested as a
means to improve the quality and duration of
response. For example, combining IMiDs with chemotherapy-based regimens—such as combined PLD,
vincristine, and dexamethasone (DVd) or combined
bortezomib and PLD—has produced higher CR/near
CR and overall response (OR) rates in phase 2 studies
of patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.9–11 Specifically, studies9,12 evaluating the efficacy and safety of DVd plus lenalidomide (the DVd-R
regimen) reported OR rates of 60% and 67%, including CRs and near CRs in 24% and 33% of patients,
respectively. Similarly, the addition of thalidomide to
bortezomib/PLD treatment resulted in a 65% OR
rate, including 23% of patients who had a CR. Thus,
it appears that multiple agents can be combined to
optimize treatment and produce a greater proportion
of CRs in patients with multiple myeloma.
These improvements have been accompanied by
studies suggesting that the order in which different
therapies are used in patients with recurrent or refractory disease may impact their efficacy and safety.
For example, combination thalidomide and dexamethasone therapy is approved for the treatment of
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.7,13 However,
results from a pooled analysis of 2 phase 3 trials
indicated that prior thalidomide exposure may result
in partial cross-resistance to subsequent treatment
with lenalidomide, resulting in reduced response
rates (53% vs 63% in thalidomide-naive patients) and
shorter time to progression (TTP) (8.5 months vs
14.2 months in thalidomide-naive patients).14,15 In
addition, patients with prior thalidomide exposure
appear to be at greater risk for venous thromboembolic events with subsequent lenalidomide therapy.15
In light of these data suggesting an element of
cross-resistance between thalidomide and lenalidomide, we were interested in determining the impact of
prior IMiD use on the efficacy of the PLD plus bortezomib regimen. Therefore, we performed a prespecified analysis of the results from a previously reported
phase 3 study that compared PLD plus bortezomib

1531

with bortezomib alone16 to determine how prior
exposure to thalidomide/lenalidomide impacted the
therapeutic advantage of prolonged TTP with the PLD
plus bortezomib combination compared with bortezomib alone. The effect of prior thalidomide/lenalidomide exposure on the safety profile of both treatment
arms also was assessed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Design
This prespecified analysis involved patients from a
previously reported randomized, parallel-group,
open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study that compared
PLD plus bortezomib with bortezomib alone in
646 patients with multiple myeloma who had
disease progression after an initial response to at
least 1 line of prior therapy or who were refractory to
initial treatment. Patients who had received prior
doxorubicin, PLD, or the equivalent amount of
another anthracycline had to have received a cumulative dose of 240 mg/m2 (calculated by using the following equivalent doses: 1 mg doxorubicin 5 1 mg
PLD 5 1.8 mg epirubicin 5 0.3 mg mitoxantrone 5 0.25 mg idarubicin). Patients were excluded
from the study if they had previously been treated
with bortezomib, experienced disease progression as
the initial response to an anthracycline-containing
regimen, or had a left ventricular ejection fraction
below normal institutional limits. Review boards at
participating institutions approved the study, which
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization,
and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice; and all
patients provided written, informed consent.
Patients were randomized to receive either PLD
at a dose of 30 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on Day 4 and bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/
m2 as a 5-second intravenous bolus dose on Days 1,
4, 8, and 11 of every 21-day cycle or bortezomib
alone at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on the same dose and
schedule. Treatment continued for at least 2 cycles
beyond a CR or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred, for a maximum of
8 cycles. However, patients with levels of paraprotein
that continued to decrease by >25% from course to
course after 8 cycles were allowed to continue treatment for as long as treatment was tolerated and there
was a response. In the current analysis, the results
were stratified on the basis of whether patients had
received prior IMiD therapy or were IMiD naive.
The primary efficacy endpoint was TTP, and secondary endpoints included overall survival, response
rate, and safety. Methods of response and progres-

sion assessment were described previously.16 Safety
assessments included adverse event (AE) reports,
changes in clinical laboratory findings, and cardiac
function tests (multiple-gated acquisition scan, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram).

Statistical Methods
The duration of TTP and the response duration for
each group was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Statistical comparisons were made by using
the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confi-

dence intervals (95% CIs) between treatment
groups.16 A heterogeneity test for the TTP between
subgroups was conducted by using a Cox model with
the addition of a treatment by subgroup interaction
term. Response rates were summarized by using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics were provided
for key baseline demographics and clinical characteristics and AEs of interest.

analysis. Of all 268 IMiD-exposed patients, 252 patients
(94%) had received prior thalidomide, and 16 patients
(6%) had received prior lenalidomide. The groups were
comparable with respect to age, sex, and baseline

treatment arm and 88% vs 49%, respectively, for the
bortezomib alone arm).

Efficacy

previously.16 A similar advantage for combination
therapy compared with bortezomib alone was
observed among IMiD-naive patients (Table 2).
Within the PLD plus bortezomib arm, the median
TTP was comparable in both IMiD-naive and IMiDexposed patients (295 days and 270 days, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the heterogeneity test between subgroups
(IMiD-naive vs IMiD-exposed; P 5 .446) (Fig. 2).
Within the IMiD-exposed subgroup, there were
17 deaths (13%) in the combination treatment arm
compared with 23 deaths (17%) in the bortezomib
alone group (Table 3). Although this difference was
not statistically significant, there was a trend toward
an overall survival benefit for the combination treatment arm (P 5 .278; HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.75–2.66). A
similar advantage for combination therapy compared
with bortezomib alone was observed among IMiDnaive patients (Table 3). At the request of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, an updated survival
analysis was performed for the overall study population using a newer data cutoff date of November 28,
2006; this updated analysis demonstrated that there
was a statistically significant difference in survival
favoring the combination versus bortezomib monotherapy.16 An updated analysis using the newer cutoff
date likewise was performed for the IMiD-naive and
IMiD-exposed subgroups. The updated analysis
demonstrated a sustained trend toward a survival
benefit for the combination, both for the IMiD-naive
patients (P 5 .117; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.90–2.46) and
for the IMiD-exposed patients (P 5 .246; HR, 1.32;
95% CI, 0.83–2.10).
Furthermore, in the PLD plus bortezomib combination arm, the objective response rate (CRs plus
partial responses [PRs]) was similar both for IMiDexposed patients (48%) and for IMiD-naive patients

(47%). Likewise, similar rates of CR, PR, near CR, and
CR plus very good PR (VGPR) were observed for both
IMiD-exposed and IMiD-naive patients who received
PLD plus bortezomib (Table 3). In patients who
achieved a response to PLD plus bortezomib, the duration of response was comparable for both IMiDexposed and IMiD-naive patients (median, 319 days
and 310 days, respectively) (Table 3).
TTP and response rates in the IMiD-resistant
cohort—defined as a subgroup of patients who
received prior IMiD therapy and had progressive disease as the best response to the therapy—also were
analyzed. The median TTP in the IMiD-resistant
cohort was comparable in patients who received PLD
plus bortezomib (n 5 25) versus bortezomib alone
(n 5 29; 183 days vs 169 days, respectively; HR, 1.41;
95% CI, 0.56–3.56 [P 5 .462]). Objective response
rates (CR plus PR) were higher numerically in the
PLD plus bortezomib combination arm versus the
bortezomib alone arm (48% vs 38%; P 5 .504). One
patient (4%) in the PLD plus bortezomib arm
achieved a CR versus no patients in the bortezomib
alone arm. Forty-four percent and 38% of patients in
the PLD plus bortezomib and bortezomib alone
arms, respectively, achieved PRs.

Safety
Overall, the proportion of patients experiencing
drug-related, treatment-emergent AEs was the same
for IMiD-naive patients and IMiD-exposed patients
who received PLD plus bortezomib (94%); whereas
the proportion of patients reporting drug-related,
treatment-emergent AEs was 83% (IMiD-naive) and
90% (IMiD-exposed), respectively, for patients who
received bortezomib alone. The proportion of IMiD-

v3.0 grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs was 69% and 46%
for PLD plus bortezomib versus bortezomib alone,
respectively; whereas the proportion of IMiDexposed patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 drugrelated AEs was 67% and 60%, respectively. Among
patients who received PLD plus bortezomib, AEs led
to the discontinuation of bortezomib in 27% and
36% of IMiD-naive and IMiD-exposed patients,
respectively; whereas 33% and 40% of IMiD-naive
and IMiD-exposed patients, respectively, reportedly
discontinued PLD because of AEs. However, it is important to note that these latter numbers are inflated
artificially, because the study protocol required discontinuation of PLD when bortezomib was discontinued; thus, the majority of patients who
discontinued PLD did so because AEs were the reasons bortezomib had been discontinued. Among
patients who received bortezomib alone, 20% of
IMiD-naive patients and 29% of IMiD-exposed
patients discontinued treatment because of AEs.
Overall, 7 patients, including 3 IMiD-naive patients
(2 who received PLD plus bortezomib and 1 who
received bortezomib alone) and 4 IMiD-exposed
patients (2 who received PLD plus bortezomib and 2
who received bortezomib alone), had drug-related
AEs that resulted in death.
The proportions of patients experiencing selected
AEs of clinical interest are presented in Table 4.
It is interesting to note that the incidence of grade
3 or 4 events, such as peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, bleeding/hemorrhage, mucositis/stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome, and thrombo

embolic events, was similar for both PLD plus bortezomib groups, regardless of prior IMiD exposure. Comparable safety results were observed with bortezomib
alone.
The overall incidence of treatment-related cardiac AEs was low and was similar between IMiD-naive patients (7%) and IMiD-exposed patients (8%)
who received PLD plus bortezomib; the rates were
slightly lower in patients who received bortezomib
alone: 5% and 6% in IMiD-naive and IMiD-exposed
patients, respectively. Among the patients who
received PLD plus bortezomib, 1 patient (1%) in the
IMiD-naive group and 4 patients (3%) in the IMiDexposed group developed congestive heart failure
related to treatment. Moreover, symptomatic arrhythmias related to treatment were observed in 3 patients
(2%) and 2 patients (2%) in each of these groups,
respectively. In comparison, 2 IMiD-naive patients
(1%) and 1 IMiD-exposed patient (1%) in the bortezomib alone group developed congestive heart failure
related to treatment. Symptomatic arrhythmias
related to treatment were observed in 2 IMiD-naive
patients who received bortezomib alone.

DISCUSSION
The current analysis demonstrated that the therapeutic advantage of prolonged TTP attributed to the PLD
plus bortezomib combination, compared with bortezomib as a single agent, was maintained regardless
of exposure to IMiD therapy in prior lines of treatment in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple
myeloma. Furthermore, the median TTP remained
unaffected by prior IMiD exposure, even in the

comparator arm that received bortezomib alone.
Although the overall survival data were not sufficiently mature to indicate a statistically significant
difference between treatment arms in either subgroup, a sustained trend favoring the combination
therapy was observed at both analysis time points. It
is interesting to note that, although the OR rates
were comparable between the 2 treatment arms, the
duration of response was significantly longer with
PLD plus bortezomib, regardless of prior IMiD exposure. Similar to the overall study population, CR and
VGPR rates in both the IMiD-naive and IMiDexposed subgroups were higher in the combination
arm versus the bortezomib monotherapy arm, supporting the hypothesis that PLD enhances the clinical benefits of bortezomib by improving the depth of
a PR or CR.16 Furthermore, the OR rate and duration
of response were similar in both the IMiD-naive
patients and the IMiD-exposed patients who received
PLD plus bortezomib. This is significant, because
IMiD-exposed patients generally are pretreated more
heavily and usually would be expected to have a
lower rate of response to conventional agents or regimens. Clearly, prior IMiD therapy did not seem to
have any impact on the efficacy of either therapeutic
arm, which would suggest a lack of cross-resistance
with either treatment to prior IMiD exposure. In
addition, prior IMiD treatment status did not seem
to compromise the safety profile of either treatment.
It is noteworthy that the incidence of neuropathy
greater than grade 3 was higher in the IMiD-exposed
patients who received bortezomib alone than in
those who received PLD plus bortezomib, suggesting
a potential benefit for use of the combination in
patients with a history of IMiD treatment.
The data regarding therapeutic outcomes in
IMiD-exposed patients are limited. Recently, a small
retrospective study (N 5 21) investigated the efficacy
and safety of bortezomib as salvage therapy for
patients with recurrent or refractory myeloma who
had received prior treatment with thalidomide.17 It is
interesting to note that the objective response rates
according to European Group for Blood and Marrow
Transplant criteria18 were comparable to those
observed for the same study population in our study
(42.8% vs 43%, respectively). Furthermore, in IMiDexposed patients, the median TTP observed with
PLD plus bortezomib in the current study (270 days)
appears comparable to that reported earlier with
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (258 days) in the
same patient population.14,15 In addition, the overall
objective response rates appear to be comparable
between these 2 combinations (48% vs 54%, respectively).

In contrast to our observations of virtually no
difference in TTP and OR rates between IMiDexposed and IMiD-naive patients who received PLD
plus bortezomib, the lenalidomide plus dexamethasone combination demonstrated a notable difference in these populations. A lower TTP and lower
OR rates were observed with this combination in
patients who had prior IMiD exposure compared
with patients who had no prior IMiD exposure.15,19
The authors of that report concluded by suggesting
the possibility of cross-resistance to lenalidomide
in thalidomide-exposed patients who did not
respond to lenalidomide.15 Clearly, as revealed by
the current study, the response to PLD plus bortezomib or bortezomib alone appears to be unaffected by prior exposure to IMiD therapy. Even in
the IMiD-resistant cohort, PLD plus bortezomib
combination therapy demonstrated a similar
response rate compared with the rates achieved in
IMiD-naive or IMiD-exposed patients. It remains to
be determined whether the cross-resistance subsequent to IMiD exposure is limited only to drugs in
the same class.
The incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs generally was
similar for both PLD plus bortezomib subgroups
regardless of prior IMiD exposure. More specifically,
it should be noted that the rate of thromboembolic
AEs observed with the combined therapy of PLD
plus bortezomib was low in the absence of any
required prophylaxis, regardless of whether patients
received prior IMiD therapy (0% in IMiD-exposed
patients, 2% for IMiD-naive patients). This is in
sharp contrast to the markedly higher published rate
of thromboembolic AEs (ie, pulmonary embolism
and deep vein thrombosis) in patients who received
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, whether or not
they had received prior thalidomide therapy (14% in
thalidomide-exposed patients, 8% in thalidomidenaive patients). This suggests that the combined regimen of PLD plus bortezomib may offer improved
safety over lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in
patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma, especially in those who have previously
received thalidomide.
In conclusion, the results of the current subgroup analysis demonstrate that neither the efficacy
nor the safety of the PLD plus bortezomib combination or bortezomib alone in patients with recurrent
or refractory multiple myeloma is affected by prior
exposure to IMiD therapy. In addition, the therapeutic advantage of a higher TTP observed with PLD
plus bortezomib compared with bortezomib alone
was maintained in this patient population regardless
of prior IMiD exposure.
