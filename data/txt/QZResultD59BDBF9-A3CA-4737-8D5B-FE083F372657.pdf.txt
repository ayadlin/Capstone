Novel Targeted Therapies in Inflammatory
Breast Cancer*
Massimo Cristofanilli, MD

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) accounts for 1% to 5% of all breast cancer cases. Its aggressive biology is characterized by rapid disease progression and poor prognosis. To improve and standardize therapy for IBC, development of
novel therapeutics to molecular targets of IBC is key. Trastuzumab treatment, an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal
antibody, has been demonstrated to improve the 3-year survival rate of patients with IBC (70.1% vs 53.3%; P ¼
.0007). Another chemotherapeutic drug, lapatinib, a dual tyrosine inhibitor of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and
HER2 signaling, in combination with capecitabine demonstrated encouraging results, with a 51% decrease in disease
progression. Further investigation is needed to confirm the efficacy of lapatinib. Cancer 2010;116(11 suppl):2837–9.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive subtype of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), with an incidence that varies across different geographic locations but typically accounts for approximately 1% to 5% of all newly
diagnosed breast cancers diagnosed in the United States.1 The multidisciplinary management approach to IBC, comprised
of a sequential process of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy, has only marginally improved
overall prognosis, which remains dismal with a 40% survival at 5 years.2
Several molecular determinants of IBC have already been identified that may serve as prime targets for the future development of therapeutic agents and contribute to improvements in prognosis.3-5 Of particular interest in both respects is
the overexpression and/or gene amplification of HER2. The introduction of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the HER2 protein, has been shown in combination with chemotherapy to significantly improve survival among women with both early6,7 and advanced stage breast cancer.8 Furthermore, the incorporation of trastuzumab
into preoperative regimens has also been associated with high pathologically complete response rates.9 With several studies
documenting an increased frequency of HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification in IBC, trastuzumab is an ideal
agent for incorporation into the therapy for this disease. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of preoperative trastuzumab with chemotherapy in patients with IBC,10-15 demonstrating pathologically complete response rates ranging from
17% to 40%. Gianni et al15 recently reported on a cohort of 327 patients enrolled on a phase 3 prospective randomized
clinical trial, the objective of which was to evaluate the addition of trastuzumab to an anthracycline-based and taxanebased preoperative chemotherapy regimen for patients with HER2-positive LABC. The authors reported that 27% of the
patients with HER2-positive disease had IBC and that the addition of trastuzumab to preoperative chemotherapy significantly increased the 3-year event-free survival rate compared with preoperative chemotherapy alone (70.1% vs 53.3%; P
¼ .0007), and thus further concluded that trastuzumab-based preoperative chemotherapy should be considered a standard
option for patients with HER2-positive LABC (including IBC).

Original Article

Lapatinib (Tykerb, GlaxoSmithKline, Research
Triangle Park, NC), a reversible inhibitor of the HER1
(ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine kinases,16 is
another targeted agent whose efficacy currently is being
evaluated among women with LABC, including those
with IBC.17-20 In combination with capecitabine, lapatinib has been shown to reduce the risk of disease progression by 51% compared with capecitabine alone
among patients with HER2-positive LABC or metastatic breast cancer who have developed disease progression
while
receiving
trastuzumab-containing
regimens.17 Cristofanilli et al20 reported on a cohort of
21 chemotherapy-naive patients who had HER2-positive IBC who received a combination of preoperative
lapatinib and paclitaxel. According to study protocol,
patients initially received 14 days of daily lapatinib (at a
dose of 1500 mg) after which it was given in combination with weekly paclitaxel (at a dose of 80 mg/m2) for
12 weeks. The authors reported good tolerance to the
regimen with an associated clinical response rate of
approximately 80%. Combinations of lapatinib are currently being studied prospectively in larger cohorts of
patients with IBC, including a phase 3, placebocontrolled trial assessing the combination with pazopanib (GW-786034; GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) an
orally administered second-generation tyrosine kinase
that blocks tumor cell proliferation by its inhibitory
action against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3; plateletderived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFR-a) and
PDGFR-b; and c-kit.
