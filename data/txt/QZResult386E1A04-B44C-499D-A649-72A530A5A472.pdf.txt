ABSTRACT:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignances in the world
and has high mortality in part due to development of acquired drug resistance.
Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance in
HCC. To explore the underlying mechanism of drug resistance in HCC, we developed
gemcitabine-resistant (GR) HCC cells. We used multiple methods to achieve our goal
including RT-PCR, Western blotting analysis, transfection, Wound-healing assay,
migration and invasion assay. We observed that gemcitabine-resistant cells acquired
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Moreover, we found that PDGF-D
is highly expressed in GR cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of PDGF-D in GR cells
led to partial reversal of the EMT phenotype. Our findings demonstrated that targeting
PDGF-D could be a novel strategy to overcome gemcitabine resistance in HCC.

INTRODUCTION

HCC [3]. Thus, it is pivotal to explore the underlying
mechanism of drug resistance and subsequently find ways
to overcome such drug resistance for achieving better
treatment outcome in HCC patients.
Gemcitabine
(2’,2’-difluorodeoxycytidine), a
deoxycytidine analogue, is used as a chemotherapeutic
drug or its combination with other agents for the treatment
of advanced HCC [4]. For example, gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin (GEMOX) have been considered as second-line
treatment in patients with HCC pre-treated with sorafenib
[5]. Moreover, chemotherapy with GEMOX prolonged
a compete response in advanced fibrolamellar HCC [5].
Recent studies have identified that GEMOX are effective

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly
aggressive malignant disease, which predicted 26,190
newly diagnosed cases and 19,590 deaths in the United
States in 2012 [1]. Approximately 70% of the patients
diagnosed with HCC cannot have curative surgery due
to metastasis at the time of diagnosis, resulting in the
median overall survival of only few months [1]. The high
mortality is also partly due to acquired drug resistance
during chemotherapy treatment [2]. It is well known that
chemotherapy is a critical management for advanced

with manageable toxicity in patients with advanced
HCC [6]. Additionally, gemcitabine in combination with
cisplatin prolonged the survival in advanced HCC [7].
Although gemcitabine is a promising drug to be considered
for the treatment of HCC, tumor cells acquire resistance
to gemcitabine that causes treatment failure for improving
the survival of HCC patients. Thus, it is necessary to
understand the underlying mechanism of drug resistance
to gemcitabine and find a novel therapeutic strategy for
effective treatment of patients with advanced HCC.
Mounting evidence demonstrates that chemoresistance is associated with the acquisition of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotypic change
of cancer cells [8]. EMT is a process by which epithelial

cells switch to mesenchymal phenotypic cells, resulting
in increased motility and invasion [9]. During EMT,
cells lose epithelial cell-cell junction and epithelial
markers such as E-cadherin, as well as gain mesenchymal
properties with high expression of mesenchyaml
molecular markers including Vimentin, Snail, Slug, zincfinger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 [10].
Multiple studies have revealed that chemo-resistance cells
often acquired EMT phenotype [8]. Our previous studies
have shown that gemcitabine-resistant (GR) pancreatic
cancer cells showed phenotypic changes consistent
with EMT and up-regulated Notch pathway [11]. In the
current study, we found that GR HCC cells acquired EMT
characteristics. Moreover, we identified that Platelet-

derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D) signaling pathway
is involved in the acquisition of EMT phenotype of GR
HCC cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PDGF-D pathway
partly reversed EMT to mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET). Our findings suggest that PDGF-D pathway is
involved in chemo-resistance and EMT characteristics of
HCC cells, demonstrating that targeting PDGF-D could
overcome resistance of HCC to gemcitabine. Therefore,
inhibition of PDGF-D may have therapeutic implications
for the successful treatment of HCC patients.

12 months. After surviving cells reached more than 70%
confluency, they were passaged by trypsinization and
exposed to increased concentration of gemcitabine. The
process was repeated until resultant HCC cells displayed
resistance to the growth inhibitory properties of 10 µg/
ml gemcitabine. The resulting cells were designated
as HCC GR cells. HCC GR cells were cultured for
additional 3 months in DMEM medium containing 10 µg/
ml gemcitabine for this study.

Morphologic changes in HCC GR cells.

RESULTS

Our previous study has shown that GR pancreatic
cancer cells had morphologic changes consistent with
EMT [11]. Therefore, we tested whether HCC GR cells
have markedly morphologic changes compared with the
parental cell lines. As illustrated in Figure 1B, HepG2
and SMMC-7721 cells displayed a rounded shape and
little formation of pseudopodia. In contrast, HepG2 GR
and SMMC-7721 GR cells had phenotypic changes
including loss of cell polarity and increased formation of
pseudopodia, leading to elongated, irregular fibroblastoid

HCC GR cells have enhanced detached and

To further identify whether HCC GR cells have
the specific molecular changes consistent with EMT, we

expression of epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin
was significantly reduced in HepG2 GR and SMMC-7721
GR cells (Figure 3). On the contrary, the expression of
mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Snail and Slug
was elevated in HepG2 GR and SMMC-7721 GR cells

siRNA (Figure 5B, 5D), suggesting that down-regulation
of PDGF-D led to the reversal of EMT to MET phenotype.

Down-regulation of PDGF-D reverses EMT to

Down-regulation of PDGF-D signaling enhances

To further confirm the role of PDGF-D in HCC
GR cells containing EMT features, we explored whether
inhibition of PDGF-D by its specific siRNA could reverse
EMT to MET. We found that PDGF-D siRNAs remarkably
inhibited the expression of PDGF-D in HepG2 GR cells
(Figure 4D) and SMC-7721 GR cells (data not shown).
Subsequently, we assessed whether EMT phenotype was
reversed in HCC GR cells transfected with PDGF-D

DISCUSSION
HCC is the one of leading causes of cancer-related
deaths in the United States [1]. Surgically unresectable
patients have a poor prognosis due to distant metastases
and in part due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs. A line of evidence has revealed
that drug resistance can be divided into oncogenic and
nononcogenic [13, 14]. Nononcogenic mechanisms
include expression of energy-dependent drug transporters
that eject anti-cancer drugs from cells, induction of
drug detoxification, and mutation in drug-targets [15].
Oncogenic drug resistance is due to activation of cellular
pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival,
leading to uncontrolled malignant growth [13]. In
line with this concept, multiple key cellular signaling
pathways, including Akt, mTOR (mammalian target of
rapamycin), NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) and Notch,
have been demonstrated to be involved in drug resistance
to conventional chemotherapeutics [16-20]. Although the
causes of drug resistance have been explored for many
years, the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance are
still largely elusive [21, 22]. Therefore, elucidation of the
underlying mechanism of drug resistance is important
to develop novel strategies for effective treatment of
advanced HCC patients.
Recently, accumulating evidence has demonstrated
that drug-resistant cancer cells are associated with the
EMT process in human cancers including HCC. For
example, Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells
showed EMT characteristics with altered β-catenin
phosphorylation [23]. Similarly, oxaliplatin-resistant
colorectal cancer cells underwent EMT progression
[24]. Paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells displayed
decreased E-cadherin expression, and increased expression
of mesenchymal markers consistent with EMT phenotype
[25]. Moreover, gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells have
EMT phenotype with down-regulation of E-cadherin and
up-regulation of Vimentin [26]. In line with these reports,
we have previously observed that gemcitabine-resistant
pancreatic cancer cells acquired EMT features [11].
Consistent with these findings, in the current study, we
found that HepG2 GR cells and SMMC-7721 GR cells
demonstrated altered morphological characteristics of cells
similar to EMT with decreased E-cadherin and increased
Vimentin, Snail and Slug, suggesting that there is a link
between chemo-resistance and EMT in HCC.
PDGF-D signaling pathway has been reported to be
involved in the regulation of various cellular processes,

such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastases
and EMT in human cancer [27]. It is known that PDGF-D
exerts its biological function through specifically binding
to and activating its cognate receptor PDGFR-β, leading
to phosphorylation of PDGFR-β and subsequent activation
of its target genes such as PI3K/Akt, mTOR, Notch, NFκB, CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4), and
Bcl-2 [28, 29]. Our previous studies have shown that
PDGF-D could facilitate EMT in prostate cancer cells
[30, 31]. Specifically, over-expression of PDGF-D caused
EMT phenotype in PC3 prostate cancer cells with loss
or relocation of E-cadherin and increased expression
of Vimentin and Nestin, suggesting that PDGF-D
overexpression contributes to EMT in human cancers
[31]. Moreover, miR-200 regulated PDGF-D-mediated
EMT partly through down-regulation of ZEB1, ZEB2 and
Snail, and up-regulation of E-cadherin in prostate cancer
cells [32]. In agreement with the role of PDGF-D in EMT,
we observed high expression of PDGF-D in HCC GR
cells consistent with EMT phenotype. More importantly,
down-regulation of PDGF-D in HepG2 GR and SMMC7721 GR cells reversed EMT to MET, demonstrating that
PDGF-D plays an important role in GR-induced EMT in
HCC.
A number of studies have demonstrated that cells
that acquired drug resistant via nononcogenic do not
become increasing malignant [15]. However, resistance
to a drug through activation of oncogenic pathways is
associated with highly aggressive cancer phenotype
including enhanced invasiveness, metastasis, and poor
overall survival [13]. In support of this note, we found that
PDGF-D was highly expressed in HCC GR cells, which
is consistent with its function in the acquisition of EMT
phenotype and enhanced migration and invasion (Figure
7). More importantly, inhibition of PDGF-D led to the
reversal of EMT to MET, resulting in decreased invasive
behavior of HCC GR cells. These results suggest that the
inactivation of PDGF-D could be a promising approach for
overcoming chemoresistance toward effective treatment
outcome of advanced HCC patients.

secondary antibodies were also obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.

Cell proliferation studies by MTT assay:
The HCC cells and HCC gemcitabine-resistant
(GR) cells (5 ×103) were seeded at equal densities into a
96-well culture plate for overnight incubation. Then, the
medium was replaced with medium containing different
concentrations of gemcitabine for 72 hours. MTT assay
was conducted as described before [33].

Wound healing assay:
The HCC cells and HCC GR cells were seeded in
6-well plate until the cells grew to 90–95% confluency.
The scratch wound was generated in the surface of the
plates using a pipette tip. Photographic images were taken
from HCC and HCC GR cells at 0 hour and 16 hours.

Cell attachment and detachment assay:
Cell attachment and detachment assays were
conducted as described before [31]. Briefly, for attachment
assay, HCC cells, HCC GR cells , and GR cells transfected
with PDGF-D siRNA were seeded in 24-well plates at 5
X 104 cells per well. Unattached cells were removed
after 1 hour incubation, and the attached cells were
counted after trypsinization. The data were presented as
a percentage of the attached cells compared to total cells.
For cell detachment assay, after 24 hours incubation, the
cells were incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 3 minutes
to detach the cells. Then, the culture medium was added
to inactivate the trypsin and the detached cells were
collected. The remaining cells were incubated with 0.25%
trypsin to detach and counted. The data were presented as
a percentage of the detached cells to total cells.

Transwell migration and invasion assays:

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The migration of HCC cells was conducted using
a 24-well Transwell chamber (Corning) with gelatincoated polycarbonate membrane filter. The invasive
capacity of HCC cells was performed using Transwell
inserts with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). After incubation
for 16 h, the upper surfaces of the Transwell chambers
were scraped with cotton swabs, and the migrated and
invaded cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
then stained with Giemsa solution. The stained cells were
photographed and counted under a light microscope in five
randomly-selected fields.

Cell culture, reagents and antibodies:
HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were cultured
at 37°C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MTT

Protein extraction and Western blotting:
Cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer
(1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein
concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein
assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). Immunoblotting
was conducted with standard protocols as described
previously [35].

Transfection:
Cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected
with PDGF-D siRNA, control siRNA using Lipofectamine
2000 as described earlier [36]. The sequences for PDGF-D
siRNA and control siRNA are listed in Table II. After the
indicated periods of incubation, the cells were subjected
to further analysis as presented under the results section.
