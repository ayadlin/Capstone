ABSTRACT
Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed the
prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). They have a distinct
toxicity profile that includes glycometabolic alterations: i.e. diabetes mellitus (DM),
impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and the metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of this
study was to evaluate the prevalence of these alterations in a cohort of CML-chronic
phase patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib.
Methods: The study involved 168 consecutive CML-chronic phase patients with no
history of DM/IFG or MS. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed,
and DM/IFG and MS were diagnosed based on the criteria of the American Diabetes
Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel
III, respectively.
Results: The nilotinib group had significantly higher levels of fasting plasma
glucose, insulin, C-peptide, insulin resistance, and total and LDL cholesterol than
the imatinib and dasatinib groups. DM/IFG were identified in 25% of the imatiniband dasatinib-treated patients, and 33% of those in the nilotinib cohort (p = 0.39
vs imatinib and p = 0.69 vs dasatinib). A diagnosis of MS was made in 42.4% of the
imatinib-treated patients, 37.5% of the dasatinib-treated patients, and 36.1% of the
nilotinib-treated patients (p = 0.46 vs imatinib and p = 0.34 vs dasatinib).
Conclusions: Treatment with nilotinib does not seem to induce DM/IFG or the
MS to a significantly higher extent than imatinib or dasatinib, though it causes a
worse glycometabolic profile. These findings suggest the need for a close monitoring
of glucose and lipid metabolism and a multidisciplinary approach in patients treated
with nilotinib.

INTRODUCTION

Based on its age distribution, it can be predicted that
prevalence of CML will increase with the increasing
age of the general population, and that this will lead to
a significantly higher risk of developing these metabolic
disorders upon treatment with certain TKIs. In fact, a
large phase III trial comparing the efficacy of nilotinib
and imatinib showed that hyperglycemia occurred in 50%
of patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg b.i.d., 53% of
those treated with nilotinib 400 mg b.i.d., and only 31%
of those treated with imatinib 400 mg/day; yet, none
of these patients discontinued TKI therapy because of
hyperglycemia or had serious diabetes-related adverse
events [13]. However, no data are available concerning
the prevalence of DM/IFG and the MS in “real-life”,
unselected CML patients on TKI therapy.
Purposes of this study were (a) to assess the
prevalence of glycometabolic alterations (DM/IFG, MS)
in a cohort of CML-chronic phase patients on TKI therapy;
and (b) to identify which parameter(s) should be evaluated
at diagnosis and during treatment to help clinicians to
choose the most appropriate TKI for each patient from a
metabolic point of view.

Until 1999, drug therapy for chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) [1,2] was limited to non-specific agents
such as busulfan, hydroxyurea, cytosine arabinoside,
and interferon-α (IFN-α) [3]. The development of
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has
dramatically changed patients’ prognosis as they potently
interfere with the interaction between the BCR-ABL1
protein and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and block the
proliferation of the malignant clone [4]. This “targeted”
approach has significantly changed the natural history of
CML and improved 10-year overall survival from less than
20% to 80-90% [2,5]. Imatinib mesylate was the first TKI
to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
for the treatment of patients with CML-chronic phase,
followed in 2007 by the second-generation TKIs dasatinib
and nilotinib [6-11].
TKIs approved for first- and second-line treatment
of CML-chronic phase have a distinct toxicity profile
that includes glycometabolic alterations such as diabetes
mellitus (DM), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and
the metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of metabolic
abnormalities characterized by insulin resistance [12].

RESULTS

Table 2, 3, and 4 show the results of the multiple
regression analyses adjusted for centre, gender, age,
BMI and length of treatment, and expressed as absolute
differences or percent changes. FPG, insulin, C-peptide,
and HOMA-IR were all significantly higher in the
nilotinib group than in the other two groups, whereas there
was no difference in HOMA-%B. Total, HDL, and LDL
cholesterol levels did not differ significantly between the
dasatinib and nilotinib groups, but they were significantly
higher in both groups than in the imatinib group, except
for HDL cholesterol between dasatinib- and imatinibtreated individuals. No difference in triglyceride levels
was found among the three groups.
On the basis of clinical and laboratory data, 45
patients (26.8%) were classified as having type 2 DM/
IFG and 67 (41.4%) as having the MS, with no significant
between-treatment group differences at both univariate
(Table 1) and multiple regression analyses (Table 2, 3
and 4). Only 2 patients (1.2%) discontinued TKI therapy
because of the development of glycometabolic alterations,
whereas 3 subjects (1.8%) required a specific treatment for
hyperglycemia, without discontinuing TKI therapy.

One hundred and sixty-eight consecutive patients
diagnosed as having CML-chronic phase and treated
with imatinib (n = 92), dasatinib (n = 40) or nilotinib (n
= 36) entered the study. Among them, 107 were in firstline, 53 in second-line, and the remaining 8 in third-line
treatment. Moreover, only 3 patients changed TKI because
of intolerance to the previous treatment, whereas all the
other patients were resistant. Our cohort included 92 males
(54.8%), and their median age at the time of recruitment
was 56.0 years (range 21.2-87.5) (Table 1).
In detail, at the time of assessment, patients in the
imatinib group were significantly older and were receiving
treatment for longer than those in the other groups.
There were significant differences in fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), insulin, C-peptide, and the Homeostasis
Model Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMAIR) index, but not in body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, hemoglobin (Hb) A1c and HOMA - β-cell
function (HOMA-%B). Moreover, there were significant
differences in total and LDL cholesterol, but not in HDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood
pressure.

DISCUSSION

nilotinib was shown to induce hyperglycemia in a subset
of non-diabetic CML patients [13,26,27]. The underlying
mechanism is controversial as a previous analysis of 10
patients demonstrated a reduction in insulin sensitivity
[28], whereas a case report showed a reversible decrease
in insulin secretion [29] under nilotinib therapy. Regarding
lipid profile, total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels were
found to increase significantly in patients treated with
nilotinib, and to decrease in those receiving imatinib [30].
The latter effect might be due to the fact that imatinib can
act also on PDGFR, which may induce phosphorylation of
LDL receptor-related protein [31].
Our cross-sectional analysis assessed the prevalence
of DM/IFG and the MS in a large series of “real-life”,
unselected CML-chronic phase patients during TKI
treatment and estimated both insulin sensitivity and
β-cell function in these individuals. We found a nonsignificant trend toward an increase in the prevalence
of DM/IFG, but not the MS, in CML-chronic phase
patients treated with nilotinib vs those receiving imatinib
or dasatinib. Moreover, individuals on nilotinib showed
significantly higher FPG, insulin, C-peptide, and total and
LDL cholesterol levels and HOMA-IR values, with no
differences in HbA1c and HOMA-%B.

Each of the TKIs approved for treatment of patients
with CML-chronic phase has a distinct toxicity profile
that should be carefully considered when prescribing
TKI treatment. It is now well known that first- (imatinib)
and second- (dasatinib, nilotinib) generation TKIs act on
different molecular targets [14], and that their side effects
are mainly due to the inhibition not only of BCR-ABL1 but
also of other tyrosine kinases such as c-kit, PDGFR, Src or
EPHB4. Imatinib mainly causes peripheral edema, whereas
dasatinib predisposes some patients to pleural effusions
and, to a lesser extent, pulmonary arterial hypertension
[15], and inhibits platelet function [16,17]. Both drugs
do not negatively impact on glucose metabolism and may
even improve FPG levels and allow a reduction of the
dosage of anti-hyperglycemic drugs [18-21]. The positive
effect of imatinib might be due to an improvement of both
insulin secretion, via inhibition of β-cell apoptosis [22]
due to increased activation of antiapoptotic transcription
factor NF-kB or decreased activation of the proapoptotic
MAPK JNK, and insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues,
via inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-α production [23]
and/or endoplasmic reticulum stress [24,25]. Conversely,

**From multiple logistic regression models.
The increase in FPG, but not in HbA1c levels,
in patients treated with nilotinib suggests that the
hyperglycemic effect of this drug may not be clinically
meaningful and that it likely does not affect post-prandial
glucose concentrations. This interpretation is consistent
with the higher HOMA-IR, but not HOMA-%B values,
indicating an impairment of insulin sensitivity with no
effect on β-cell function. Also the lack of significant
increases in the prevalence of DM/IFG observed in
patients receiving nilotinib, which is at variance with
a previous report from a phase III trial [13], seems to
argue against the concept that the effect of this drug on
glucose metabolism represents a real clinical problem.
This view is consistent with a previous report that
fasting hyperglycemia does not progress to type 2 DM
in nilotinib-treated individuals [27]. However, our
prevalence data might have been influenced by a selection
bias caused by the significant inter-groups differences
in age and duration of TKI treatment, which may have
not been accounted for by statistical adjustment. In fact,
patients on nilotinib were younger and with a shorter
treatment duration than those on imatinib and dasatinib.
Taken together, our data, while excluding a potent
diabetogenic effect of nilotinib, do support the need for
a close monitoring of glucose (and lipid) metabolism in
patients receiving this drug and for a multidisciplinary
approach to manage rises of FPG (and cholesterol)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels during treatment. In clinical practice, it would be
appropriate to measure FPG, cholesterol, and possibly
HbA1c levels before treatment to identify subjects at risk
to develop glycometabolic abnormalities and to guide the
choice of the TKI. Moreover, the same parameters should
be assessed at 3 months of treatment, and in the nilotinib
group every 6-12 months thereafter. This strategy would
be adequate for reducing cardiovascular burden associated
with hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, which may increase
the risk of atherosclerosis with peripheral artery occlusion
occurring with nilotinib treatment [30,32,33].
Strengths of our study include the “real-life”
setting and the size of the cohort, which is much larger
than in previous reports [18-21,26]. Limitations include
the cross-sectional design of the study, the already
mentioned differences among treatment groups in terms
of age and duration of TKI therapy, and the criteria for
excluding the presence of DM and the MS at baseline. In
addition, the fact that an oral glucose tolerance test was
not performed in the study subjects might have resulted in
an underestimation of the prevalence of DM.
In conclusion, this cross-sectional analysis of CMLchronic phase patients on treatment with three TKIs
showed that prevalence of DM/IFG or the MS was not
significantly different, though glycometabolic profile was
worse in subjects treated with nilotinib than in those on
imatinib or dasatinib. These findings indicate the need

of treatment. Two sets of comparisons were made: 1)
nilotinib and dasatinib vs imatinib; and 2) nilotinib vs
dasatinib. In the case of FPG and LDL cholesterol, the
regression coefficients represent absolute differences (in
mg/dL). Conversely, as the other laboratory data were
right skewed, we fitted regression models using their
log10-transformed values as dependent variables, and then
calculated their percent changes using the formula: %
change = [antilog10(Coefficient) – 1]×100 [37]. For DM/
IFG and the MS, we used logistic regression models to
calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), once again using the imatinib or dasatinib
groups as reference [38]. The statistical analyses were
made using Stata 13 software [39].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
One hundred and sixty-eight consecutive CMLchronic phase patients attending the Oncohematology
Division of the IRCCS Ca’ Granda – Maggiore Policlinico
Hospital Foundation, Milan, and the Hematology Unit of
the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital Foundation,
Pavia, were recruited between May 2013 and July 2014.
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committees,
and all patients gave their written informed consent in
accordance with the Italian guidelines for the protection
of human subjects. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years,
CML-chronic phase diagnosis based on World Health
Organization 2008 criteria, and current treatment with
imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib [14]. CML patients who
received only IFN-α therapy were excluded from the
analysis, as were those with a previous history of DM/
IFG, MS, or statin treatment. FPG levels and body weights
before starting TKI treatment were also available in all
cases.
