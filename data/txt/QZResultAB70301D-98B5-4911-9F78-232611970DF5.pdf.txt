ABSTRACT:
The endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), a neurotransmitter was shown to
have anti-cancer effects. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) metabolizes AEA and
decreases its anti-tumorigenic activity. In this study, we have analyzed the role of
FAAH inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have shown that FAAH
and CB1 receptor which is activated by AEA are expressed in lung adenocarcinoma
patient samples and NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460. Since the synthetic analogue of
anandamide (Met-F-AEA) did not possess significant anti-tumorigenic effects, we used
Met-F-AEA in combination with FAAH inhibitor URB597 which significantly reduced
EGF (epidermal growth factor)-induced proliferative and chemotactic activities in vitro
when compared to anti-tumorigenic activity of Met-F-AEA alone. Further analysis of
signaling mechanisms revealed that Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 inhibits
activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling ERK, AKT and NF-kB. In addition, it
inhibited MMP2 secretion and stress fiber formation. We have also shown that the MetF-AEA in combination with URB597 induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by downregulating
cyclin D1 and CDK4 expressions, ultimately leading to apoptosis via activation of
caspase-9 and PARP. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibited tumor
growth in a xenograft nude mouse model system. Tumors derived from Met-F-AEA
and URB597 combination treated mice showed reduced EGFR, AKT and ERK activation
and MMP2/MMP9 expressions when compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 alone. Taken
together, these data suggest in EGFR overexpressing NSCLC that the combination of
Met-F-AEA with FAAH inhibitor resulted in superior therapeutic response compared
to individual compound activity alone.

INTRODUCTION

cancer are categorized as NSCLC. Poor prognosis and
chemotherapeutic resistance which may be due to
modulation of key cell signaling mechanisms pose major
concerns [2-3].
The cannabinoid family is categorized into
endogenous cannabinoids (produced inside the body),
phytocannabinoids (plant derived) and synthetic
cannabinoids which activate the specific G-protein
coupled receptors CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptor is mainly
expressed in the brain and CNS whereas CB2 receptor is
expressed in immune system [4-6]. The use of cannabinoid

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a metastatic
form of cancer which accounts for about 85% of lung
cancer cases and is the primary cause of cancer related
deaths in the United States. Though tobacco smoking is
the major cause of lung cancer, about 15-20% of cases
are attributed to non-smokers and involve the activation
of various signaling pathways for tumor development

agonists as anti-cancer agents has proven successful in
various in vitro and in vivo cancer models such as glioma,
breast, prostate, colon, leukemia and lymphoid tumors
[7-10]. They have been shown to modulate various
cell survival pathways such as the extracellular signalrelated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK),
protein kinase B (AKT) and ceramide pathways [1113]. Anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) are the two well characterized endocannabinoids
which are endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid
receptors. Although endocannabinoids were initially
studied for their neurological and psychiatric effects,
there is increasing evidence of their contribution to
inflammation and tumorigenesis [14-15]. AEA, which
is mainly synthesized from phospholipids, is inactivated
by enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediated
hydrolysis to arachidonic acid (AA) and ethanolamine
(EA), whereas 2-AG is hydrolyzed into AA and glycerol
[16-20]. Thus, the effects of the endocannabinoids are
profoundly affected by their enzyme mediated hydrolysis.
Moreover, inactivation of FAAH activity has been shown
to potentiate the anti-tumorigenic effects of AEA in
prostate cancer [21]. However, the exact roles of FAAH
and its regulation of AEA activity have not been elucidated
in the context of tumorigenicity in NSCLC. In our work,
we focus on AEA, an endogenous cannabinoid agonist
specific for the CB1 receptor and the effect of FAAH
inhibition on the activity of AEA.
The genetic abnormalities associated with lung
cancer are attributed to alterations in the signaling
pathways which are targets for drug therapies. Most
of these stimulatory signaling pathways are driven to
a malignant phenotype characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation and an apoptosis escape mechanism.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a family of
four Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR (ERBB1,
HER1), ERBB2 (HER2, Neu), ERBB3 (HER3) and
ERBB4 (HER4) [22-23]. EGFR dysregulation is
associated with multiple cancer types including malignant
transformations and metastasis [24]. EGFR overexpression
and signaling pathway gene mutations play a vital role in
lung tumorigenesis. Recent evidence suggests that cancer
cells undergo escape mechanisms to defend against the
host system by activation of alternative growth signaling
pathways [25]. The cell cycle in eukaryotes is regulated
by a family of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases
(CDKs), which are members of protein kinase complexes.
Each complex consists of a cyclin (regulatory subunit)
which binds to a CDK (catalytic subunit) to form an
active cyclin-CDK complex that gets activated at various
checkpoints during the cell division cycle [26-27]. Several
studies indicate that cell cycle markers are mutated in
most malignant cancers and might lead to Programmed
Cell Death (PCD), where cells undergo suicide program

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[26-28]. Apoptosis is a type of PCD which involves the
activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation [29-31].
Cell cycle dysregulation and resistance to apoptosis are
often attributed to abnormal EGFR signaling [22, 32].
Hence, identification of novel receptors expressed in
tumor cells that target against EGFR activation will be a
promising strategy against NSCLC.
In our present study, we analyzed the effect of AEA
on lung tumorigenesis when FAAH is inhibited. We show
that Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 reduces
NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that
the combination treatment inhibits the activation of EGFR
and its downstream signaling targets. These findings
suggest the possibility of exploring the components of
endocannabinoid system as a novel therapeutic target for
NSCLC treatment.

RESULTS
Primary lung cancer tissues and NSCLC cell lines
express CB1 and FAAH
Anandamide is known to mediate its effects through
cannabinoid receptor CB1 [7, 30]. Hence, the expression
of FAAH and CB1 were assessed in the NSCLC cell linesA459, A549, CALU1, H460 and H1299 (Fig 1A). All the
cell lines expressed FAAH and CB1 as detected by Western
Blot. Also, we utilized tissue microarray (TMA) to detect
levels of FAAH and CB1 in cancer patients. Eleven of
fifty seven (19.3%) lung adenocarcinomas showed high
cytoplasmic expression of FAAH (Fig 1B, C). Twenty two
of thirty five (62.9%) lung adenocarcinomas showed high
cytoplasmic expression of CB1 (Fig 1D, E).

FAAH inhibition enhances the anti-proliferative
activity of Met-F-AEA in NSCLC cell lines
Proliferation is one of the characteristic features
of cancer cells to grow and multiply [33-35]. To analyze
whether inhibiting FAAH can enhance the activity of
Met-F-AEA (synthetic analogue of anandamide), we
evaluated the potential of Met-F-AEA in combination
with FAAH inhibitor- URB597 as a possible therapeutic
target. We treated the NSCLC cell lines- A549 and H460
with either FAAH inhibitor- URB597 or Met-F-AEA or
in combination and observed the effects after 24h. MTT
assay showed a significant decrease in cell viability in the
combination treatment when compared to Met-F-AEA
alone (Fig 2A, B). Also, we performed clonogenic assay
which measures the ability of single cell to form clones.
Combination treatment significantly reduced the number
of colonies when compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597
alone in both the cell lines (Fig 2C, D).

FAAH inhibition enhances the anti-migratory and
anti-invasive activities of Met-F-AEA in NSCLC
cell lines

To enhance the effect of the endocannabinoid Met-FAEA, we used the siRNA approach to knockdown FAAH
in H460 cells. To analyze the efficiency of knockdown,
the transfected cells were subjected to Western Blot
analysis, which showed reduced expression of FAAH
(Fig 2E). Cells transfected with FAAH siRNA were more
sensitive to Met-F-AEA treatment than the control siRNA
transfected cells (Fig 2F). These data suggest that Met-FAEA in combination with URB597 inhibits cell growth
in vitro.

Migration and invasion are required for cancer
cells to spread within the specific tissue and form the
characteristic features of angiogenesis and metastasis
[36]. The extracellular matrix (ECM) acts as a barrier
towards this cell motility process. Chemoattractants like
EGF provide a directed migration for cancer cells [22,
32, 36]. We further analyzed the effects of Met-F-AEA in
combination with URB597 on EGF induced chemotaxis

and observed significant inhibition in EGF induced cell
motility (S1), migration (Fig 3A, B) and invasion (Fig 3C,
D) when compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 alone in
A549 and H460 cells.
To migrate through the ECM, cancer cells possess
extended protrusions that are rich in actin filaments and
adhesion molecules [37]. We investigated the effects of
Met-F-AEA when FAAH is inhibited on EGF induced
actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, which were
detected by changes in actin and vinculin expressions,
respectively. We observed that cells treated with the
combination treatment significantly inhibited EGF induced
actin and vinculin expressions more effectively than MetF-AEA or URB597 alone. Further examination with the
confocal microscopy revealed the decreased presence

of migratory structures such as lamellipodia in the cells
treated with the combination treatment when compared to
control (Fig 3E).
Tumor invasion begins with protrusion of the ECM
and basement membrane. The matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) family has been shown to be responsible for
degradation of the ECM, which is one of the initial steps
in metastasis. Higher expressions of MMP2 and MMP9
have also been correlated with poor prognosis in early
stages of lung adenocarcinoma [38]. In our present study,
we observed a significant decrease in secretion of MMP2
by zymogram when cells were treated with combination
treatment, Met-F-AEA along with URB597 (Fig 3F).
These data suggest that the Met-F-AEA in combination
with URB597 inhibits cell migration and invasion in

cells underwent significantly reduced EGF induced NF-kB
translocation into the nucleus when compared to Met-FAEA or URB597 alone (Fig 4A,B).
The EGFR signaling pathway activates diverse
cellular targets which are crucial for cell proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, migration and adhesion and
are often dysregulated in cancer cells. AKT and ERK
are important survival molecules that are essential for
EGF induced cell growth and motility [22, 25, 32].
To understand the molecular mechanism by which
FAAH inhibition enhances Met-F-AEA and regulates
EGFR pathway, we treated the cells with Met-F-AEA
together with URB597, induced with EGF and observed
reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, serine
phosphorylation of AKT and tyrosine phosphorylation
of ERK which are the immediate downstream targets

FAAH inhibition enhances Met-F-AEA mediated
inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC cell lines
NF-kB is involved in invasion and metastasis in
various cancer types [39]. Previous studies have shown
that NF-kB activation is involved in EGFR mediated lung
tumor progression [39-40]. Therefore, we sought out to
determine if FAAH inhibition can enhance Met-F-AEA
mediated inhibition of EGF induced NF-kB activation by
luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transfected with either
vector or NF-kB plasmid and the translocation of NF-kB
into the nucleus was studied in the presence or absence of
EGF. Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 treated

FAAH inhibition enhances Met-F-AEA induced
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at later stage

of EGFR pathway when compared to Met-F-AEA or
URB597 alone (Fig 4C, D).
To further validate that FAAH inhibition enhances
the anti-tumorigenic effects of Met-F-AEA, H460 cells
were transfected with FAAH siRNA, treated with MetF-AEA or vehicle, stimulated with EGF and analyzed by
Western blotting. Cells transfected with FAAH siRNA
and treated with Met-F-AEA showed reduced expression
levels of P-AKT and P-ERK when compared to Met-FAEA alone (Fig 4E).
Taken together, these results indicate that Met-FAEA in combination with URB597 downregulates EGFR
receptor activation and also significantly inhibits the
downstream signaling targets of EGFR pathway.

Cell cycle dysregulation is frequently associated
with cancer growth. EGFR activation leads to tumor cell
survival, aberrant cell cycle and evasion of apoptosis,
ultimately leading to resistance to cytotoxic therapies
[22, 25, 32]. Hence, we sought to assess whether MetF-AEA in combination with URB597 can induce cell
cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. Cells were treated with
control, Met-F-AEA, URB597 or combination treatment
of Met-F-AEA with URB597 for 48h and subjected to cell
cycle analysis. We observed significant cell cycle arrest
in the G0/G1 phase in the combination therapy treated

cells when compared to Met-F-AEA alone (Fig 5A).
Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells as shown by TUNEL assay
(Fig 5B, C, D) and significantly inhibited pro-caspase9
and pro-PARP. Apoptosis was also induced by cell cycle
arrest, as we observed significant decrease in cyclin D1
and CDK4, which are essential for G1/S phase progression
(Fig 5E, F). These results show that Met-F-AEA together
with URB597 induced apoptosis and is mediated by cell
cycle blockade.

Cannabinoids and their derivatives are being focused on
cancer treatments because of their association with pain
modulation, cell growth inhibition, anti-inflammation,
tumor regression, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The
endocannabinoid system is involved in a complex
array of signaling pathways which might be receptor
dependent or independent [7-10]. Though recent studies
have shown that endocannabinoids exert potential antitumor effects in various cancer cells [41], not much is
known about their effects in lung cancer. Here, we report,
for the first time that Met-F-AEA and FAAH inhibitor
URB597 significantly inhibited NSCLC growth. We have
also explored the mechanisms by which Met-F-AEA in
combination with URB597 inhibits NSCLC tumor growth.
In our present study, we found that FAAH and
cannabinoid receptor CB1 are expressed in lung cancer
patient samples as well as in NSCLC cell lines. Increased
FAAH expression has been associated with poor patient
survival in prostate and breast cancer [21, 42]. Also,
overexpression of FAAH was found to be sufficient to
increase migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells
[21]. Our results show that Met-F-AEA that binds to CB1
does not have significant anti-tumorigenic effects in vitro
and in vivo. This might be due to the conversion of AEA
by enzyme FAAH into metabolites, leading to limitation
in the concentration and action of the ligand. Previous
reports show that AEA is converted into arachidonic acid
(AA) and ethanolamine (EA) by FAAH enzyme [19-20].
AA is metabolized by COX2 and other enzymes to form
prostaglandin (PGE2) and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EE)
[43-44]. These secondary metabolites have been shown to
enhance tumor growth and metastasis in various cancer
types [44-45]. Also, there are reports which suggest that
methanandamide increases murine lung tumor growth by
modulation of prostaglandin (PGE2) production and COX2
expression[44]. Therefore, in our study, we blocked FAAH
pharmacologically (by using FAAH inhibitor URB597)
and genetically (by siRNA approach) to enhance the antitumorigenic effects of Met-F-AEA. Our results show, for
the first time, that Met-F-AEA, together with URB597
exerts anti-proliferative effects on NSCLC in vitro and in
vivo.
In our study, we have shown that Met-FAEA in combination with URB597 inhibits EGFR
phosphorylation and downregulates EGFR mediated
signal transduction pathways involving AKT and ERK,
which are key cell survival molecules, in vitro and in
vivo. This is important because EGF/EGFR axis is known
to regulate cancer cells to proliferate and migrate to
distant sites. Furthermore, aberrant EGFR expression and
function lead to highly aggressive lung tumors, ultimately
causing poor patient survival and increased resistance to
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs [22, 24]. Thus, it
would be interesting to identify novel targets that have
growth inhibiting effects by targeting the EGFR pathway.
In our present study, we observed that Met-F-AEA in

FAAH inhibition enhances Met-F-AEA mediated
inhibition of NSCLC tumor growth in vivo by
downregulating EGFR signaling
To evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of Met-FAEA in combination with URB597 in vivo, we determined
the anti-tumorigenic potential of the combination
treatment on H460 cells in nude mouse model. We induced
tumors by injecting H460 cells subcutaneously into the
right flank of male nude mice. When the tumors reached a
palpable size, we treated them with ethanol control, MetF-AEA, URB597 or Met-F-AEA in combination with
URB597 every third day for three weeks. Tumor volume
was monitored throughout the treatment period (Fig 6A).
We observed a dramatic decrease in tumor formation in the
combination regime treated mice as compared to control
(Fig 6B, C). H&E staining revealed that the combination
regime treated tumors were less aggressive and necrotic
than the control tumors (Fig 6D). In addition, there was
a significant decrease in the expression of proliferation
marker Ki67 and hence, a reduced mitotic index in MetF-AEA and URB597 combination treated tumors as
compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 treated tumors alone
(Fig 6E, F).
To further determine the mechanism by which the
tumors are inhibited, we isolated the tumor xenografts
from the nude mice and extracted protein and RNA from
them. The Met-F-AEA and URB597 combination treated
tumors showed lesser phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK
and AKT compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 treated
tumors alone (Fig 6G). Also, real time PCR analysis
revealed that MMP2 and MMP9 levels were significantly
downregulated in the URB597 treated tumors and Met-FAEA in combination with URB597 treated tumors when
compared to the control (Fig 6H), confirming with our in
vitro findings.

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer is estimated to be one of the most fatal
cancer related malignancies in the world and fatality is
often associated with drug resistance complications.
Thus, there is an immediate requirement to develop
innovative ways for the treatment of this disease [2-3].

combination with URB597 inhibits stress fiber and focal
adhesion formations. Focal adhesions have been shown to
connect the ECM to actin stress fibers thus re-organizing
the matrix and regulating cell migration [36]. They are the
main subcellular macromolecules that form close contacts
between cells and the ECM. They play an important
role in cell growth and migration. Transformation of
epithelial cells into invasive carcinomas also depends
on reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that leads to
stress fiber assembly [46]. Furthermore, the Met-F-AEA in
combination with URB597 reduces EGF induced invasion
and also downregulates MMP2 secretion, which mediates
the invasiveness of cancer cells by aiding them to degrade
the ECM and metastasize [38].
Our results show that Met-F-AEA in combination
with URB597 causes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest mediated
apoptosis, which is shown by reduction in G1/S phase
checkpoint markers Cyclin D1 and CDK4 and apoptotic
markers caspase-9 and PARP. This is important because in
cancer, there exists an imbalance between cell proliferation
and apoptosis which leads to tumor progression. Also,
uncontrolled cellular growth due to aberrant EGFR
signaling leads to dysregulation of the cell cycle, which
involves G1/S checkpoint markers that are responsible for
cell cycle progression [26, 47]. Furthermore, apoptosis,
a programmed cell death mechanism [48], is usually
associated with cell cycle arrest. Hence, our results suggest
the ability of Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 as
an apoptosis inducing agent, controlling the cell survival/
death cycle.
Overall, the results of our study suggest that the
activity of the endocannabinoid anandamide increases
when FAAH is inhibited, leading to enhanced antiproliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects.
We have also shown that Met-F-AEA in combination
with URB597 crosstalks with EGF receptor to inhibit its
activation, subsequently leading to downregulation of its
signaling targets. These implicate that Met-F-AEA along
with URB597 can be used as an effective therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of EGFR overexpressing
NSCLC. This is especially imperative considering the
resistance of NSCLC to various chemotherapeutic drugs
and its poor prognosis.

Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well
in 96 well plates and allowed to grow for 24h. Briefly,
cells were treated with Met-F-AEA (10µM), URB597
(0.2µM) or in combination. Cell viability was measured
using the MTT assay (Roche) as described in the supplier’s
protocols, based on the absorbance reading at 570nm with
respect to the control.

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded at low density in complete media
(1000 cells per well in six well plates) and treated with
vehicle, Met-F-AEA/URB597 or in combination for six
days. After the treatment period, cells were washed with
PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20min, washed
again, stained with 0.1% crystal violet and individual
clones were manually counted under the microscope.

Chemotaxis and wound healing assays
For the migration assay, 8µm transwell plates
(Corning-Costar) were used. Briefly, cells were seeded in
the upper chamber and chemoattractant EGF (100ng/ml)
was added to the lower chambers as previously described.
12 hours after EGF stimulation, cells that migrated to
the lower chamber were fixed, stained using Hema stain
and counted. For the invasion assay, pre-coated Matrigel
invasion chambers (BD Falcon) were used. After 24 hours
of stimulation with EGF similar to that in migration assay,
invaded cells were stained and counted. Wound scratch
assay was done as described previously [49].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies

FAAH small interfering RNA

Met-F-AEA and URB597 were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich. Antibodies used were P-AKT, caspase-9,
PARP, CDK4 (Cell Signaling), P-ERK, ERK, AKT,
GAPDH, P-EGFR, EGFR (Santa Cruz), cyclin D1, Ki67
(Neomarkers) and FAAH (Cayman Chemicals).

H460 cells were transfected with FAAH
siRNA (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine, as per
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Scrambled
non targeting siRNA was used as control. 36h after
transfection, cells were treated with either Met-F-AEA or
vehicle and subjected to MTT and western blot analysis.

Immunofluorescence

Apoptosis assay

Cells were seeded in 8 well chamber slides, treated,
fixed and incubated with primary antibodies phalloidin
or vinculin overnight at 4°C. After washing, cells
were stained with Alexa Fluor- 488 or 594 conjugated
secondary IgG antibodies and visualized under Olympus
FV1000 Filter confocal microscope.

Apoptosis was detected in cells using ClickiT TUNEL assay kit (Life Technologies). Cells were
washed, fixed and treated with TdT enzyme for 1h. Then,
the cells were stained with AlexaFluor 594 dye-labeled
reaction buffer for 30min and detected under fluorescent
microscope (Olympus).

Gelatin zymography

Mouse xenograft model

Gelatin zymography was used to determine MMP
activity. Briefly, supernatants of treated cells were
collected, concentrated using centrifugal filter units
(Millipore) and run on Novex zymogram gel. The gel was
then renatured and developed to visualize the bands as per
the manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies).

H460 cells (2x106) in 100µl PBS were injected
subcutaneously into the left flank of each male nude
mouse. Once the tumors reached palpable size, they were
treated with Met-F-AEA (5mg/kg), URB597 (1mg/kg) or
in combination for 3 weeks. Tumor volume was calculated
using the formula vol. = length*(width)2/2.

Luciferase reporter assay

Real Time PCR

NF-kB activity was determined using NF-kB
luciferase reporter assay (Promega). To determine the
luciferase reporter activity, NF-kB luciferase constructs
containing either the wild type or NF-kB vector were
transfected in the pre-treated cells using lipofectamine.
For internal control, cells were co-transfected with Renilla
luciferase vector. 24h after transfection, EGF (100ng/ml)
was added and then incubated for another 24h. Then, the
cells were lysed to perform the luciferase assay as per the
manufacturer’s protocol.

RNA was isolated from tumors using TriZol reagent
(Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed as described earlier
[50].

Western blotting

Statistical analysis

Cells were washed, lysed and protein estimation
was performed using Bradford assay. Aliquots of cellular
lysates (50µg) were electorphoresed on a 4-12% Novex
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for an hour at room
temperature. The membranes were then probed overnight
with specific primary antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4°C.
After washing thrice with 1X TBST, blots were exposed
to secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP,
1:2000) for an hour, washed thrice and detected using ECL
chemiluminescence detection system (Thermo Scientific).

Results were represented as mean ± SD which were
analyzed using Student’s two-tailed t test. A value of
P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Tissue Microarray (TMA) and Immunochemical
(IHC) analyses
TMA and IHC were performed as described earlier
[10, 50].
