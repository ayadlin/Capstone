BACKGROUND: Survival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have remained stagnant over the past 30 years. Targeting of ganglioside GD2, a glycosphingolipid on the cell surface of some tumors, with immunotherapy has resulted in improved outcomes for
patients with neuroblastoma. In the current study, the expression pattern of GD2 was examined in osteosarcoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on osteosarcoma samples from patients at the time of initial biopsy, definitive surgery, and disease
recurrence. The intensity and location of staining were scored. Cell-based enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay was performed on
osteosarcoma cell lines to quantitate the level of GD2 expression. RESULTS: Forty-four osteosarcoma samples were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry, including 8 samples from the initial biopsy, 28 samples from the definitive surgery, and 8 samples from the
time of disease recurrence. GD2 was expressed on all 44 osteosarcoma samples. Osteosarcoma tissue obtained at the time of disease
recurrence demonstrated a higher intensity of staining compared with samples obtained at initial biopsy and definitive surgery
(P 5.016). The majority of osteosarcoma cell lines expressed GD2 at higher levels than the neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-C. CONCLUSIONS: Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on osteosarcomas. Clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of targeting GD2 in

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in childhood. Despite multiple clinical trials, cure rates for patients
with osteosarcoma have not significantly improved over the past 30 years, and survival for patients with metastatic or recurrent
disease remains dismal.1,2 Novel approaches to the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma are needed to improve outcomes.
Monoclonal antibodies targeted against cell surface antigens specific to tumor cells have been proven to be effective
in patients with breast cancer, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma.3-5 Disialoganglioside GD2 is a glycosphingolipid that is
expressed on the cell surface of limited normal adult tissue: the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, skin melanocytes, and mesenchymal stromal cells.6-8 GD2 is also expressed on tumor cells and has been shown to be uniformly
expressed on the surface of neuroblastomas and many melanomas.6,9,10 Varying expression of GD2 has been shown in
tumors in patients with lung cancer, central nervous system tumors, and sarcomas.11,12 Due to the relatively isolated
expression of GD2 on malignant cells, it is an attractive target for antibody-mediated therapy and anti-GD2 antibodies
have been shown to improve survival for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.5,13
To the best of our knowledge, the expression of GD2 on the cell surface of osteosarcomas has not been fully evaluated, although prior reports suggest it is expressed.11 In the current study, we explored the usefulness of GD2 as a potential target for antibody-mediated therapy in patients with osteosarcoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Samples and Cell Culture

Human osteosarcoma tumor tissue was obtained from patients at the time of initial biopsy, definitive surgery, or at disease
recurrence. All tissue microarray samples were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The majority of samples were

decalcified and the tissue microarray was constructed as
previously described.14,15 All tumor samples used for
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) were
obtained from patients with osteosarcoma who were
treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York City. Tumor samples obtained at the time of
definitive surgery all had  50% necrosis to be able to
accurately assess GD2 expression across specimens. All
specimen collection and analysis were performed in accordance with an Institutional Review Board-approved
protocol and all patients or their guardians provided written informed consent. Primary cell cultures were generated by standard collagenase disaggregation of tissues.16
All isolated cells were cultured in Eagle minimum essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and
antibiotics in a 5% carbon dioxide humidified atmosphere at 37 C. All short-term cultures were established
within 20 passages. The neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-C
and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
Va) and were maintained in the suggested media and
additives.
Immunohistochemistry

Slides that contained the paraffin-embedded microarray
and control tissues were baked and subsequently deparaffinized. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched
using 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Antigenic
proteins were unmasked using universal antigen retrieval
solution (IHC World, Woodstock, Md). The tissue was
blocked with 10% normal goat serum in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline and stained
with 100 ug=mL 14.G2a antibody diluted in 5% BSA
overnight (14.G2a antibody was a generous gift from Dr.
Karen Muszynski at the National Cancer Institute). Commercially available paraffin-embedded melanoma tissue
known to uniformly express GD2 (BioChain Institute,
Hayward, Calif) was used as positive control, and the
purified immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a diluted in the same
diluent as above was used instead of the primary antibody
as the negative control. Slides were placed in a humidified
chamber during incubation with primary antibody.
Detection of the antibody-binding reaction was performed with biotinylated secondary antibody coupled
with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Avidinbiotinylated enzyme complex (Vectastain ABC System;
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tissue was
treated with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (BioFx Laboratories,
Owings Mills, Md) to identify sites of additional antibody

binding and counterstained with hematoxylin. The tissue
was then dehydrated with alcohol, permeated with xylene,
and mounted with Permount organic mounting solution
(Fisher Scientific Inc, Pittsburgh, Pa). Stained slides were
viewed using a Nikon Inverted Microscope ECLIPSE
TE200 (Nikon Instruments Inc, Tokyo, Japan) attached
to a CCD (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights,
Mich).
The intensity and location of tissue staining were
assessed by a comparison with the positive and negative
controls. Staining was considered positive (111) only if
the location and intensity of staining was consistent with
that of the control melanoma tissue with 67% to 100% of
cells staining positive. Tissue was considered negative if
there was a definitive absence of staining. Slides were considered to demonstrate sporadic staining (1) if 1% to
33% of cells stained positive or intermediate staining
(11) if 34% to 66% of cells stained positive. Tissue was
assessed and graded by 2 independent observers who were
blinded to the timing at which the specimens were
obtained (initial biopsy, definitive surgery, or disease recurrence). Specimens with discordant assessments were
rereviewed by the 2 observers and a consensus was
reached.
Cell-Based ELISA

Twenty-four short-term cultures (OS71, OS191, OS194,
OS223, OS229, OS231, OS233, OS238, OS242,
OS248, OS268, OS269, OS290, OS291, OS297,
OS300, OS301, OS303, OS307, OS308, OS314,
OS319, OS322, and OS323) described previously were
used for ELISA.16 A total of 10,000 cells were plated in
96-well plates and incubated overnight (37  , 5% carbon
dioxide) in serum-free media (Eagle minimum essential
medium, 1% Pen-Strep [Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY], and 1% nonessential amino acids). Cells
were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and incubated at
room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated
with blocking solution (2% BSA in phosphate-buffered
saline). After blocking, plates were washed and incubated
with primary antibody (100 ng of 14G2a antibody [Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif]) while shaking
slowly (50 revolutions per minute on an I2400 New
Brunswick incubator shaker). After additional washes,
secondary antibody was added (1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG2a in
phosphate-buffered saline; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and incubated. Plates were then washed and 100 lL of
TMB substrate was added to each well. After the substrate
turned blue, 100 lL of stop solution was added (1M

Benchmark Plus microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules,
Calif).
Standard curve preparation

Purified human GD2 protein (American Research Products, Belmont, Mass) was plated in a 96-well plate at concentrations from 12.5 ng=well to 1600 ng=well. Plates
were incubated overnight. The ELISA procedure was
identical to that used for the osteosarcoma cells with the
exception that no fixing step was performed.

A tissue microarray analysis with 44 samples was used.
The samples were stained with 14G2a, a murine monoclonal anti-GD2 antibody, and the distribution and intensity of GD2 staining was qualitatively graded
compared with positive and negative control samples
(Fig. 1). There was 96% concordance between the independent observers.
The results of the tissue microarray demonstrated
the presence of GD2 in 100% of the patient samples (Table 1). No significant difference was noted in GD2 staining between samples obtained from the initial biopsy and
samples obtained from the definitive surgery. However,
the percentage of cells staining positive for GD2 was significantly greater in tissue obtained at the time of disease
recurrence compared with tissue obtained at initial biopsy
or during the definitive surgery. One hundred percent of
samples obtained at the time of disease recurrence displayed intermediate or positive staining compared with
53% of samples obtained at the initial biopsy or definitive
surgery (P 5 .016).
GD2 Quantification

Statistical Analysis

Results of the immunohistochemistry assays are reported
as frequencies of negative staining (-), sporadic staining
(1: 1%-33% of cells stained positive), intermediate staining (11: 34%-66% of cells stained positive), and positive
staining (111: 67%-100% of cell stained positive)
sorted by the time at which the specimen was obtained
(initial biopsy, definitive surgery, and disease recurrence).
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the difference
between intermediate and positive staining (11 and
111) versus negative and sporadic staining (- and 1) in
the recurrence samples versus the biopsy and definitive
surgery samples. A P value < .05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

To evaluate GD2 expression quantitatively, a cell-based
ELISA was performed on 24 osteosarcoma short-term cultures (Fig. 2). Neuroblastoma and fibrosarcoma are
malignancies known to express GD2. Thus, the neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-C and the fibrosarcoma cell line
HT1080 were used as positive controls for this experiment. Nearly all of the osteosarcoma cell lines demonstrated levels of GD2 expression that were comparable to
the neuroblastoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Approximately 83% and 46% of osteosarcoma cell lines expressed
GD2 at higher levels than BE(2)-C and HT1080, respectively. Approximately 41% of osteosarcoma cell lines
expressed GD2 at a level that was twice that of BE(2)-C
and 12.5% of osteosarcoma cell lines demonstrated
expression that was 5 times that of BE(2)-C.

RESULTS
Demographics

Forty-four human osteosarcoma tissue samples from 41
individual patients were available to evaluate GD2 expression. Approximately 18% of samples were obtained from
the initial biopsy, 64% were obtained at the time of definitive surgery, and 18% were obtained at the time of disease
recurrence (Table 1). One recurrent specimen was
obtained from a metastatic bone lesion. All other speci550

DISCUSSION
Over the past decade, the identification and targeting of
proteins specific to cancer cells has become increasingly
important to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. In recent years, targeted therapy such as imatinib,
trastuzumab, and CH14.18 has improved survival for
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer,
and neuroblastoma, respectively.4,5,17 Similar to this

istration. Our findings that GD2 is highly expressed on
the surface of osteosarcoma cells provide promising data
supporting the development of clinical trials assessing the
efficacy of anti-GD2 therapy in patients with
osteosarcoma.
The results of the current study demonstrated that
specimens of recurrent osteosarcoma demonstrated higher
expression of GD2 compared with samples obtained at
initial biopsy and definitive surgery. This finding suggests
that osteosarcoma cells with high expression of GD2 may
be more resistant to chemotherapy and provides additional support for targeting the antigen in clinical trials.
To validate this finding, prospective studies assessing
changes in GD2 expression between primary and recurrent specimens from individual patients will need to be
conducted.
Numerous preclinical and clinical trials have assessed
targeting GD2 in patients with cancer, focusing on 2
murine monoclonal antibodies, 3F8 and 14G2a, and a

GD2 as a Target in Osteosarcoma/Roth et al

The majority of these studies have focused on patients with
neuroblastoma and melanoma, due the high surface expression in these malignancies. A few patients with osteosarcoma have been included in early phase 1 studies of GD2
antibodies. Varying responses were noted in these patients,
and 1 patient with multiple bone metastases who was
treated with 14G2a plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) had a complete response (Table 2).5,9,10,13,18,19,21-29 The addition of
IL-2 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor to anti-GD2 therapy demonstrated increased antibodydependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.30,31 A recent study
by Yu et al demonstrated that Ch14.18, an anti-GD2 antibody, improved survival for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma when administered with granulocytemacrophage-colony-stimulating factor and IL-2.22 Patients
with no evidence of residual disease appeared to derive the
greatest benefit from the antibody therapy, and patients
received the treatment after intensive induction chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant, surgery, and radiotherapy. These findings may have implications for the
design of protocols incorporating CH14.18 in the treatment of patients with other malignancies that express GD2
on the cell surface.
Current anti-GD2 therapy induces cytotoxicity by
stimulating the host immune system to clear tumor cells
bound by antibody.30,31 It is difficult to assess the cytotoxicity of anti-GD2 therapy in vitro and osteosarcoma xenograft models are frequently in an immunosuppressed
background. Thus, although it is feasible to demonstrate
the antibody binds osteosarcoma cells, it is difficult to
clearly assess tumor response and cytotoxicity. One potential approach will be to assess the effectiveness of antiGD2 antibodies with cytokines in canine models of osteosarcoma because the dogs have fully functional immune
systems. These studies should address tumor response,
time to disease progression, and overall survival in dogs
with osteosarcoma who are treated with anti-GD2 antibody therapy. In addition, it is unclear whether the GD2
antigen remains on the cell surface of osteosarcoma cells
after treatment with anti-GD2 antibody, similar to neuroblastoma.29,32 Canine studies should assess the persistence
of surface GD2 antigen after antibody treatment and
could assess the usefulness of GD2 expression as a predictive biomarker.
The poor survival of patients with metastatic and
recurrent osteosarcoma, despite decades of clinical trials,
highlights the need for novel anticancer agents. The current study finding that GD2 is highly expressed on osteosarcoma cells when paired with recent data demonstrating
the effectiveness of anti-GD2 therapy support the develCancer
