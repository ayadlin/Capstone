ABSTRACT
Due to the inability of classical chemotherapeutic agents to exclusively target
tumor cells, these treatments are associated with severe toxicity profiles. Thus, longcirculating liposomes have been developed in the past to enhance accumulation in
tumor tissue by passive targeting. Accordingly, commercially available liposomal
formulations of sterically stabilized liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx®, Doxil®, Lipodox®)
are associated with improved off-target profiles. However, these preparations are
still not capable to selectively bind to target cells. Thus, in an attempt to further
optimize existing treatment schemes immunoliposomes have been established
to enable active targeting of tumor tissues. Recently, we have provided evidence
for therapeutic efficacy of anti-IGF1R-targeted, surface modified doxorubicin
loaded liposomes. Our approach involved a technique, which allows specific postmodifications of the liposomal surface by primed antibody-anchor conjugates thereby
facilitating personalized approaches of commercially available liposomal drugs.
In the current study, post-modification of sterically stabilized liposomal Dox was
thoroughly investigated including the influence of different modification techniques
(PIT, SPIT, SPIT60), lipid composition (SPC/Chol, HSPC/Chol), and buffers (HBS, SH).
As earlier in vivo experiments did not take into account the presence of non-integrated
ab-anchor conjugates this was included in the present study. Our experiments provide
evidence that post-modification of commercially available liposomal preparations for
active targeting is possible. Moreover, lyophilisation represents an applicable method
to obtain a storable precursor of surface modifying antibody-anchor conjugates.
Thus, these findings open up new approaches in patient individualized targeting of
chemotherapeutic therapies.

INTRODUCTION

half-life and in a reduced volume of distribution
leading to decreased accumulation in healthy tissues
and, ultimately diminishing side effects such as dose
limiting cardiotoxicity [2–4]. Moreover, due to the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [5]
Dox containing liposomes accumulate preferentially
in tumor tissues leading to so called passive targeting
effects [6, 7]. The prime example for such a liposomal
product already clinically approved and on the market

Over the last two decades liposomes have been
developed as potent carrier systems for several drugs
including cytostatic agents [1]. There are several
advantages in using liposomal encapsulated drug over
the administration of the respective free drug. In case of
Doxorubicin (Dox) for example encapsulation drastically
alters pharmacokinetic properties resulting in extended

is sterically stabilized liposomal Dox (Caelyx®, Doxil®,
Lipodox®) [8].
As shown in the past, the specificity and efficiency
of the passive targeting can furthermore be increased
by applying specific ligands to the liposomal surface
resulting in an active targeting approach [9]. Depending
on the ligand, such surface modification can result in
endocytic uptake of the whole drug delivery system
thereby enhancing intracellular drug delivery [10]. One
promising therapeutic target that has been addressed by
recent research is the IGF1 receptor (IGF1-R). Based on
its strong expression in a wide range of human cancers and
the important contribution of IGF1-R dependent effects
on tumor biology [11, 12] different IGF-1-R targeting
approaches have been developed with some promising
results in preclinical and early clinical trials [12–16].
However, as it remains uncertain whether inhibition of
IGF1-R signaling alone is sufficient to mediate sustained
therapeutic effects, the combination with free cytotoxic
agents has been initiated to complement effects of the
targeted therapies [14, 17, 18].
Following this combinatory approach recently we
have aimed at the development of anti IGF1-receptor
antibody (1H7) coupled liposomal Dox to implement the
therapeutic strategies as outlined above in one approach
[19]. As IGF1-R dependent signaling has been shown to
promote tumorigenesis and hypersecretion syndromes
in neuroendocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic
system (GEP) [20–22], we investigated these IGF1-Rtargeting immunoliposomes in a preclinical xenograft
model with promising therapeutic potential for the
treatment of GEP-NETs.
GEP-NETs are neoplasm with an estimated incidence
of 5.25 per 100,000 population [23]. For patients with
GEP-NET, surgery is considered as a curative treatment
option. However, around 80% of newly diagnosed patients
develop metastasis, requiring systemic treatment modalities
[24]. The 5-year survival rates of patients with metastasized
NETs is calculated to be 30% for NETs of pancreatic origin
and 45% for NETs of ileal origin [25]. For rapid growing
tumors chemotherapy represents a palliative therapeutic
option. As the response rate to mono-therapy has been
low, most chemotherapeutic regimens for neuroendocrine
tumors rely on combination therapy [26–28]. However,
while many reports have demonstrated modest sensitivity
for pancreatic NET with response rates to chemotherapy
ranging from 40 to 60%, metastatic carcinoid tumors with
response rates of 20% are considered as poor responders to
chemotherapy [23] [28]. Thus, additional treatment options
for patients with GEP-NETs are urgently needed.
Therefore, the aim of our current study was further
characterization of our recently developed anti-IGF1R
targeting immunoliposomal therapy and furthermore
the optimization of the post-modification approach. The
possibility of post-modification of the commercially
available drug Caelyx® might provide a very promising
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

possibility for patient-individual therapeutic targeting
approaches in the future.
To improve the understanding for the influence of
different parameters on the post-modification of liposomal
drug delivery systems, liposomes in this study where either
composed of SPC/Chol or HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG
(as in Caelyx®) and modified with either anti-GD2-ab
(hu14.18, neuroblastoma model) or anti-IGF1R-ab (1H7,
GEP-NET model). Two different anchor molecules were
tested for integration of ab into liposomal membranes
and three different techniques were applied for coupling
(PIT, SPIT, SPIT60). Surprisingly, efficacy of post surface
modification of commercially available Caelyx® was
strongly dependent on buffer composition, which was then
thoroughly investigated.

RESULTS
Cellular association of 1H7 modified liposomes
with BON cells
In a first step, targeting ability, specificity and uptake
route of anti IGF1-R directed liposomes using a cholesterolbased NHS-anchor was determined. Therefore, RhodaminePE labelled SPC/Chol liposomes were modified using a
Chol-PEG-NHS anchor coupled with either the specific
1H7 antibody (SPC/Chol-1H7) or an unspecific IgG
antibody (SPC/Chol-IgG). Cellular interaction was
determined at 37°C and 4°C. While 37°C values represent
passive and active cellular processes (like endocytosis),
4°C values only result from cellular attachment, as active
metabolic processes do not occur at 4°C. As shown in
Figure 1, control preparations (unmodified SPC/Chol and
unspecific SPC/Chol-IgG) revealed no cellular association
at 37°C (5.0 ± 0.7% and 1.3 ± 0.9%) as well as at 4°C
(1.5 ± 0.4% and 0.0 ± 0.0%) indicating no binding or
uptake of liposomes (Figure 1A).
In contrast, 1H7 modified liposomes revealed high
cellular association at 4°C (64.2 ± 17.3%) and almost
total association at 37°C (91.6 ± 2.7%) indicating that
SPC/Chol-1H7 liposomes specifically bind to BON cells
and that surface modification using an NHS activated
Cholesterol-based anchor is applicable for our purposes. A
decreased cellular association at 4°C suggests a metabolic
active uptake process such as endocytosis at 37°C, which
was confirmed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1C).

Receptor mediated uptake
In order to clarify, whether the cellular uptake of
SPC/Chol-1H7 is due to receptor mediated endocytosis,
competition experiments with free 1H7 ab were performed
to block the receptor. BON cells were pre-incubated with
different concentrations of free 1H7 ab, followed by
co-incubation with SPC/Chol-1H7 liposomes. The
detected cellular association was drastically reduced

94.6 ± 0.8%, 7 µg/ml: 7.0 ± 1.4%; 14 µg/ml: 6.3 ± 4.2%;
21 µg/ml: 3.7 ± 1.4%; Figure 1B) which provides evidence
of a receptor mediated uptake.

buffer system on surface modifications via PIT technique
(DSPE-based anchor) or SPIT (Chol-based anchor) was
investigated. As the 1H7 ab was not available in large
quantities, another well established targeting model system
was used: the neuroblastoma cell line Kelly (expressing
the GD2 receptor) and the human anti GD2 antibody
(hu14.18) [29].
Flow cytometry data revealed a comparable
targeting efficiency of SPC/Chol liposomes for both
anchor types (PIT 85.8 ± 1.9%; SPIT 91.1 ± 2.1%;
Figure 2A) while liposomes composed of HSPC/Chol/
DSPE-mPEG (Caelyx® lipid composition) displayed
significant differences in cellular association after surface
modification via PIT and SPIT (PIT 82.9 ± 1.6%; SPIT
61.5 ± 4.0%; Figure 2A). Using PIT-modification, no
significant differences in cellular association for both lipid
compositions were determined (HSPC/Chol 82.9 ± 1.6%;

Adapting lipid and buffer composition to Caelyx®
For in vivo experiments it was intended to
use liposomal Doxorubicin. As sterically stabilized
liposomal Doxorubicin is already clinically approved
and commercially available (Caelyx®), this product was
investigated for its feasibility to be post modified for
active targeting of tumor cells. Unlike the beforehand
used SPC/Chol liposomes, which were dispersed in HBS,
the HSPC-based Caelyx® liposomes are dispersed in a
histidine buffered isotone sucrose solution (SH). Thus,
the influence of the lipid composition as well as the

SPC/Chol 85.8 ± 1.9%). This reduced targeting efficiency
after SPIT might be due to a reduced insertion of the Cholbased anchor at 20°C compared to the insertion of the
DSPE-based anchor at 60°C (as with PIT). As the phase
transition temperature for HSPC is about 55°C [30, 31], a
higher temperature should facilitate anchor insertion into
the liposomal membrane. Thus, for further experiments
the insertion temperature for the SPIT was also elevated
to 60°C (SPIT60) to potentially improve anchor insertion.
In a next step the influence of the buffer system on
anchor insertion was determined. For these experiments
only the Caelyx® lipid composition was used, as this was
the composition intended to be used in the in vivo model.
HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes were surface modified
via PIT, SPIT or SPIT60 and the cellular association was
determined by flow cytometry. Cellular association for
SPIT-modified liposomes buffered with either HBS or
with SH was quite comparable (SPIT HBS 61.5 ± 3.99%
vs SPIT SH 70.2 ± 3.4%; SPIT60 HBS 88.67 ± 1,01 vs
SPIT60 SH 83.1 ± 2.7%; Figure 2B). Interestingly, HSPC/
Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes dispersed in HBS displayed
a significant superior targeting effect for SPIT modified
liposomes when insertion temperature was increased to
60°C (SPIT 61.5 ± 3.9% vs SPIT60 88.7 ± 1.0%) indicating
that insertion of anchor entity should be conducted above
phase transition temperature of liposomes as well as anchor
lipid. Surprisingly, cellular association was significantly
reduced for PIT-modified liposomes using SH buffer
instead of HBS buffer (SH 58.6 ± 3.1% vs HBS 82.87 ±
1.6%). Thus, these results demonstrated the SPIT method
to be superior over PIT for surface modification of Caelyx®
liposomes.

weeks, sizes stayed stable for PIT and SPIT 60, whereas an
increase was determined for SPIT preparations (PIT 85.5
± 2.7 nm; SPIT 113.9 ± 0.3 nm; SPIT60 d 42: 127.0 ±
3.6 nm). Regarding PDI values, no significant changes
were detectable for PIT, whereas an initial increase was
observed for SPIT and SPIT60 preparations (Caelyx®
0.135 ± 0.01, PIT 0.112 ± 0.009, SPIT 0.179 ± 0.006;
SPIT60 0.272 ± 0.006; secondary y-axis in Figure 3 A) The
high PDI value for SPIT60 preparations indicates a rather
inhomogeneous formulation that might not be suitable
for in vivo use. The PDI for the PIT preparation (PIT d
42: 0.126 ± 0.014) as well as the SPIT60 preparation
(SPIT60 d 42: 0.263 ± 0.007) stayed constant over
6 weeks. The SPIT preparation displayed a tolerable
PDI at first, but debased over storage time (SPIT d 7:
0.230 ± 0.006; SPIT d 42: 0.259 ± 0.007), resulting in
similar values as observed for the SPIT60 preparation
right after surface modification. With regard to Dox
encapsulation efficiency, neither anchor type nor insertion
temperature had a negative impact. All three preparations
still revealed good encapsulation efficiencies above 90%
(Caelyx® 95.6 ± 0.1%; PIT 93.9 ± 0.6%; SPIT 95.0 ±
0.4%; SPIT60 93.2 ± 1.5%) as well as storage stability
over 6 weeks (Figure 3B).

In vitro targeting efficiency after storage of
surface modified liposomes
Targeting efficiency was evaluated after storage of
the surface modified preparations. HSPC/Chol/DSPEmPEG in SH buffer (displaying Caelyx® model liposomes)
were prepared and the surface was modified by PIT, SPIT,
and SPIT60 with an anti-GD2 ab. Cellular association was
evaluated after production (day 0) and after 1 and 6 weeks
of storage at 4°C. For stored preparations size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) of liposomes was performed
prior to experiments to remove free ab-anchor conjugate,
thus, the unpurified preparation was stored. This is in
accordance with the preparations for in vivo studies, as for
this preparation the non inserted ab-anchor conjugate is
not removed as well. As it turned out, cellular association
was not affected by storage for 7 days, whereas an, even
though not significant, still reasonable reduction was
observed for SPIT after storage of 6 weeks (PIT d 0:
57.4 ± 2.7%, d 7: 67.7 ± 2.3%; d 42: 63.2 ± 4.0%; SPIT
d 0: 61.4 ± 6.2%, d 7: 61.4 ± 4.2%; d 42: 46.4 ± 3.5%;
SPIT60 d 0: 75.6 ± 1.5%, d 7: 82.4 ± 4.1%; d 42: 70.5 ±
1.7%; Figure 3C). Thus, our experiments demonstrate the
feasibility of all three methods to result in storable surface
modified liposomal preparations for at least 7 days.

Influence of surface modification of Caelyx® on
size, PDI and EE
As mentioned before, the clinically approved drug
Caelyx® was intended to be used for in vivo experiments.
Therefore, the influence of surface modification on the
stability of this drug was investigated. The encapsulation
efficiency of Dox in Caelyx® liposomes is declared to be
higher than 90%, leaving an amount of 10% of free drug.
This amount of free drug should not be increased due
to surface modification as the free drug is known to be
responsible for higher side effects accompanied by less
efficiency. Therefore, stability of encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of Dox, liposomal size and polydispersity index (PDI)
were investigated. Stability was analyzed after surface
modification by PIT, SPIT andSPIT60 as well as after storage
of the modified preparations at 4°C over a period of 6 weeks.
An increase in size was observed in all cases after
surface modification, most pronounced for the SPIT60
preparation (Caelyx® 82.6 ± 1.4 nm; PIT 89.3 ± 1.2 nm;
SPIT 98,1 ± 0.2 nm; SPIT60 131.5 ± 5.3 nm; primary
y-axis in Figure 3A). An initial increase in size after
surface modification is reasonable due to ab size which is
roughly about 10 nm in length [32]. After a storage of 6

Stability of ab-anchor conjugate
The possibility to prepare ab-containing liposomes
on demand would be a very important step towards patient
individualized therapy. Therefore, a protocol for the
preparation of a storable, ready to use ab-anchor conjugate
43701

was developed. This ab-anchor conjugate could then be
used for surface modification of any preformed liposomal
drug. After ab-anchor reaction of anti GD2 ab with both
anchor types (Chol- and DSPE-based) and the addition
of histidine, the ab-anchor conjugate was freeze dried
without the addition of any further substances and used
for modification after rehydration. Control experiments
were also performed with freshly prepared, not lyophilized
ab-anchor conjugates (w/o lyo). Lyophilized ab-anchor
conjugates were either rehydrated immediately after
the freeze drying process (d 0) or after 6 and 12 weeks,
respectively, inserted into the membrane of Rh-PE
labelled SPC/Chol liposomes according to the SPIT or PIT
protocol, and subsequently analyzed via flow cytometry.
Only SPC/Chol liposomes were used for insertion of
ab-anchor conjugates, as no attention to phase transition
temperature had to be paid with this lipid composition.
For both ab-anchor conjugates (Chol-PEG-ab
and DSPE-PEG-ab), lyophilisation did not impair the
targeting efficiency of the ab. The cellular association for
the preparations with lyophilized ab-anchor conjugate was
even higher (SPIT w/o: 74.3 ± 0.9% and d 0: 81.6 ± 2.5%;
PIT w/o: 74.1 ± 4.2% and d 0: 88.6 ± 1.6%; Figure 3D).
Thus, lyophilisation of the ab-anchor conjugate is feasible.
Cellular association of surface modified liposomes
prepared from stored lyophilized ab-anchor conjugates
revealed stable values over at least 12 weeks at 4°C (SPIT
d 84: 78.8 ± 0.8%; PIT d 84: 96.0 ± 0.2%).

methods for surface modification of Caelyx® liposomes
regarding size and PDI as well as EE of Dox. The
functionality of the surface modification itself was tested
with empty liposomes composed of the same lipid mixture
and dispersed in the same buffer system and resulted in
high targeting efficiencies. Regarding storage stability,
PIT was superior to SPIT, and SPIT60 was determined
not to be suitable due to the high PDI indicating a
polydisperse preparation. Thus, only SPIT and PIT were
further evaluated for surface modification with the 1H7
ab in the GEP-NET system (BON cells). As it turned out,
the targeting efficiency in this systems with this ab was in
general much lower than achieved in the neuroblastoma
model with the anti GD2 ab. Furthermore, stronger
influences of both, lipid and buffer composition, were
observed. Unexpectedly, for SH-buffered preparations
almost no targeting effect was obtained (SPIT HBS:
26.9 ± 5.0% vs SH: 9.7 ± 3.8%; PIT HBS: 70.0 ± 12.5%
vs SH: 8.9 ± 3.8%; Figure 4A).

In vivo
As demonstrated, considerable effects were
observed for the insertion of ab-anchor conjugates in
liposomal preparations dispersed in SH buffer instead of
HBS buffer. Less effective insertion consequently leads
to a higher amount of free ab-anchor conjugate, which
might be responsible for additional effects. As removal
of free ab-anchor conjugate generally was not performed
prior to the in vivo studies, additional control experiments
with free ab-anchor were included in the study protocol.
Therefore, and different to our previous studies [19] a
control preparation was designed consisting of additional

Transfer of data to 1H7-BON model

efficiency

free anchor coupled 1H7-ab and not only free 1H7. This
preparation was administered together with unmodified
Caelyx® (L + AK) in comparison to surface modified
Caelyx®-1H7. Similar to earlier findings, a significant
increase in overall survival in this new setting was still
detectable for Caelyx®-1H7 compared to NaCl treated
controls (p = 0.01) in the xenograft model for GEP-NETs,
but significant differences in comparison to Caelyx®
+ anchor-1H7 were diminished (p = 0.09). Moreover,
repeated treatments did not lead to the expected additive
increase in overall survival (Figure 4B).

As the presence of the SH buffer had an obvious
negative effect on the surface modification of Caelyx®
it was further evaluated, whether exchanging the buffer
would improve the targeting efficiency. Therefore, HSPC/
Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes were prepared in SH and
the external buffer was subsequently replaced by HBS
using a vivaspin device. To also consider effects due to the
vivaspin procedure itself, control liposomes were prepared

DISCUSSION

in SH buffer, undergoing the vivaspin preparation with
SH buffer again. After vivaspin procedure, surface
modification via SPIT and PIT was performed and the
cellular association of the preparations was determined via
flow cytometry. As depicted in Figure 5A, an exchange of
external SH to HBS (SH-HBS) resulted in significantly
higher cellular associations for both methods compared to
liposomes for which the external buffer was still SH (SHSH) (SPIT SH-SH: 7.9 ± 5.3% vs SH-HBS: 38.6 ± 0.1;
PIT SH-SH: 7.4 ± 6.1% vs SH-HBS: 49.2 ± 6.2).

The aim of our current study was the detailed
investigation and characterization of the influence of postmodifications for specific immunoliposomal targeting,
using Caelyx® liposomes and its lipid composition as
basal formulation. Although sterically stabilized liposomes
as Caelyx® and pegylated immunoliposomes both reach
tumor tissues by the same mechanism, passive targeting
via the bloodstream, only immunoliposomes are capable to
selectively bind to target cells [33, 34]. Moreover, despite the
potential of enhanced therapeutic efficacy immunoliposomal
preparations provide over unmodified liposomes the
feasibility of personalized targeting approaches.
In recent years, the IGF1R has been suggested
to be a promising target for different human cancers
[12, 35]. Accordingly, IGF1R inhibitors were evaluated in
preclinical and early clinical trials. However, although antitumoral activity of these agents has been demonstrated for
several tumor entities there is a growing body of evidence
that receptor blockage alone is not sufficient to induce
a potent and sustained effect on tumor growth. Thus,
combination with free cytotoxic agents has been used to
complement effects of these targeted therapies [35].
In an attempt, to combine these different therapeutic
strategies in a single formulation we developed recently
anti-IGF1R-Dox loaded immunoliposomes and revealed
enhanced targeting efficiencies against tumor cell lines
of different human origin [19]. In our current study, we
confirmed in a first step our previously obtained high
targeting efficiencies of anti-IGF1R-ab SPIT-post-modified
liposomes using a preclinical model for GEP-NETs (BON,
Figure 1A). Moreover, as recent studies showed, that

Buffer exchange with Caelyx®
It was furthermore evaluated, whether a buffer exchange
is generally also feasible for Caelyx® liposomes. The influence
of changing the external buffer to HBS on liposomal size, PDI
and Dox EE was determined with and without subsequent
surface modification. Furthermore, cryo-TEM images were
taken to eventually detect unwanted changes in morphology
due to buffer exchange.
Regarding changes in size, no significant
differences were detectable after buffer exchange and only
minimal changes in PDI were observed (Caelyx® HBS:
75.7 ± 0.4 nm; SPIT: 84.8 ± 0.4 nm; PIT 82.4 ± 0.4
nm; Figure 5B). Moreover, no differences in Dox EE
were observed, indicating stability of liposomes despite
buffer exchange from a sugar based to an ionic (NaCl)
buffer (Caelyx® HBS: 95.6%; SPIT: 96.0%; PIT: 96.0%;
Figure 5C). Cryo-TEM images of Caelyx® before and after
buffer exchange depict uniform liposomes and show, that
this procedure had no impact on the morphology of the
liposomes. The visualization of the Dox crystals confirms
the high encapsulation efficiency of Dox (Figure 5D).

receptor down-regulation due to internalization is highly
important for therapeutic efficacy of IGF1R-targeting
approaches [35, 36] and as internalization of liposomes via
a receptor mediated process furthermore has been shown
to improve the nuclear delivery of encapsulated Dox to
target cells leading to increased cytotoxic activity of the
drug over non-targeted liposomes [34, 35], we investigated
in a next step the cellular uptake route of our liposomal
preparation. Our results provide evidence for a specific
endocytic internalization of SPC/Chol-1H7 liposomes by
BON cells by confocal microscopy in vitro (Figure 1C). In
addition, cellular association was drastically reduced after
pre-treatment with different free 1H7-ab concentrations
indicating occupancy of IGF1-R sites on the cell surface
resulting in a decrease of targeting efficacy (Figure 1B).

Apart from the uptake mechanism, many other
factors are known to influence the therapeutic index and
targeting efficiencies of liposomal encapsulated cytotoxic
agents, such as lipid composition, liposome size, lipid
dose, charge and forms of stabilization [37]. Consequently,
we aimed at the investigation of the impact of specific
lipids (SPC vs HSPC). Furthermore, as it turned out
that even the buffer composition was highly relevant we
also tested different buffer compositions (SH vs HBS)
towards different applicable surface modifications (PIT vs
SPIT vs SPIT60) and vice versa also the impact of these
surface modifications on Caelyx® liposomal size, PDI and
encapsulation efficiency of Dox.
To the best of our knowledge, the detailed influence of

HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG) has not yet been investigated
in detail and is an important prerequisite for a putative
clinical translation of specifically targeted Caelyx® -based
immunoliposomes. As sterically stabilized liposomal Dox
is under extensive investigation since many years showing
anti-tumoral efficacy for a wide range of human cancers
[38] and furthermore is already commercially available we
intended to deploy this product for our purposes. Its main
characteristics are the high Dox encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of over 90%, the high stability and its prolonged
plasma circulation time due to its unique lipid composition
[39]. Thus, as the aim of any developed drug delivery
system should be its applicability for a later use in humans,
we are convinced that the optimization of an already proven
Dox delivery system is advantageous.
Our experiments revealed a considerable influence
of the lipid composition (SPC/Chol vs HSPC/Chol)
on surface modification when deploying the SPIT
method. Cellular association was significantly reduced
for liposomes composed on the bases of Caelyx®,
using HSPC/Chol compared to SPC/Chol liposomes
(Figure 2A). When deploying the PIT method, no
influence of the lipid composition was observed. As for
the PIT technique the temperature is elevated during
anchor insertion, we also used the SPIT at 60°C either
(SPIT60), leading to comparable results as with SPIT with
SPC/Chol liposomes (Figure 2B), while having a positive
effect on HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes. Our results
indicate, thus, that the Chol-based (SPIT60) as well as the
DSPE-based anchor [40] are generally feasible for surface
modification of liposomes being composed of the same
lipids as Caelyx®.
In recent years there was a rapid development of
various targeted therapeutic approaches. Targets now
include receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (e.g. HER2,
EGFR, MET), intracellular kinases (e.g. PI3K, MEK,
AKT), transcription factors (e.g. STAT3), stem cell
pathways (SHH/SMO, Notch), immunomodulators
(e.g. CTLA4, PD1/ PDL1, vaccines), and hormone
receptors (e.g. estrogen, progesterone, androgen).
However, despite advantages as high specificity or oral
administration routes, they also bare specific challenges
as stability or delivery problems and they furthermore
often still require concomitant classic cytotoxic regimens
for optimal therapeutic benefit [41]. Immunoliposomal
preparations bear the potential to overcome these
limitations for some of these targets. However, an
important pre-requisite for such personalized approaches
of an established liposomal agent is effective postmodification and ensured stability of the chemotherapeutic
component, to not alter pharmacokinetic advantages of
the established delivery system. In our experiments, we
could demonstrate, that none of the surface modification
methods had an impact on the encapsulation efficiency
of Dox (Figure 3B). Size and PDI increased for both
SPIT methods (Figure  3A). SPIT60 modification led
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to a substantial increase in the PDI immediately after
preparation indicating a rather inhomogeneous preparation.
This method was therefore judged as inappropriate
for further use. For SPIT, increase in size and PDI was
detected after a storage period of one week. Considering
storage stability, only the PIT preparation turned out to
be suitable for a storage over 6 weeks. Focusing on the
stability of the surface modification and thereby the
efficiency of targeting, all three methods proved to be
stable (Figure 3C and 3D). Pursuing another option for
obtaining a storable preparation, the ab-anchor conjugates
were lyophilized and the stability was tested over a period
of 12 weeks, revealing no significant changes in the their
ability to enable cellular association after reconstitution
and insertion into SPC/Chol liposomes (Figure 3D).
Thus, lyophilisation represents an applicable method
for obtaining a storable precursor of surface modified
liposomes. This approach is an important prerequisite
for the production of surface modified liposomes at
the bedside. The shelf-life of Caelyx® is not impaired
as the product itself remains unchanged until surface
modification. No further steps for the preparation of the
ab-anchor conjugate has to be performed. Thus, only the
storability of the ab-anchor conjugate have to be assessed
and this conjugate can then be utilized for a wide range of
targets using different ab types and preformed liposomal
drugs [42]. Consequently, the insertion behavior of the
ab-anchor conjugates into different liposomal species has
to be assessed beforehand while storage stability of the
surface modified product has not to be monitored as it will
not be necessary to store the surface modified liposomal
preparation.
Changing the buffer composition on the bases
of Caelyx® liposomes (from HBS to SH buffer) our
experiments with HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes
unexpectedly indicated a remarkable impact on surface
modification via PIT. Cellular association after PIT was
significantly reduced while no influence for both SPIT
methods was detectable (Figure 2B). First experiments
had been carried out with an anti-GD2-ab neuroblastoma
model system and were also performed with anti IGF1 R
modified HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes in a GEPNET model. Interestingly, buffer impact was even higher
in this system (Figure 4A). The same effect was also
indirectly detectable in subsequent in vivo experiments
(Figure 4B) using ab-anchor-conjugates as internal control
instead of free 1H7 antibody. A significant increase in
overall survival for Caelyx®-1H7 compared with NaCl
treated controls was still detectable, but previously
obtained significant differences in comparison to Caelyx®
+ antibody were diminished [19].
Further attempt was focused on the question,
whether an exchange of buffer might increase therapeutic
efficacy. After replacement of the sucrose containing SH
buffer by a NaCl containing (HBS), cellular association
was indeed restored for both SPIT and PIT modified
43706

Oncotarget

preparations (Figure 5A). These experiments confirmed
that the reduced anchor insertion and therefore targeting
ability of surface modified liposomes was impaired by
the sucrose containing buffer of Caelyx® liposomes and
this is a very important finding for further optimization
of immunoliposomal preparations. To evaluate, whether
improved conditions would also increase efficiency of the
targeting efficiency of Caelyx®, a buffer exchange was
performed with this preparation. No significant differences
in size, size distribution or encapsulation efficiency of Dox
was detected after exchanging external buffer to HBS for
unmodified and consecutively surface modified liposomes.
Cryo-TEM images confirmed integrity of Caelyx®
liposomes (Figure 5B–5D). These findings demonstrate,
that buffer exchange and therefore optimization of surface
modification was also possible for Caelyx®.
In summary, we provide evidence that postmodification of commercially available liposomal
preparations for active targeting is possible and these
findings open up new approaches in patient individualized
therapy. Further studies will focus on evidence of this
approach in in vivo studies.

Chol/DSPE-mPEG in a molar ratio of 56:38:5. For
analysis via flow cytometry 0.5 mol% of Rh-PE was
added. Briefly, lipids were dissolved in Chloroform
and solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator. The
resulting lipid film was dried at minimal pressure for 2
h. Subsequently, the lipid film was hydrated by adding
a buffer stated below resulting in a lipid concentration
of 20 mM for SPC/Chol and 21.5 mM for HSPC/Chol/
DSPE-mPEG liposomes. Two different buffers were
used, HEPES buffered saline (HBS, 10 mM HEPES,
140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and a sucrose histidine buffer
(SH, 10 mM histidine, 280 mM sucrose, pH 6.5). The
dispersion obtained was homogenized by extruding
20 times through a polycarbonate membrane with
200 nm pores and 21 times with 80 nm pores using a
hand-extrusion device (LiposoFast; Avestin, Ottawa,
Canada). For HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes all
steps were performed in a water bath at 70°C and the
buffer used was preheated. If Dox containing liposomes
were needed, the commercially available pharmaceutical
product Caelyx® was used. HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG
liposomes as well as Caelyx® already contain a pegylated
lipid. Due to the more rigid bilayer and the presence of
PEG chains on the surface the amount of ab-anchor
conjugate was reduced to 1.25 mol% instead of 5% as in
SPC/Chol liposomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

Surface modification of preformed liposomes

Lipids, soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC), hydrogenated
soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) and 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] (DSPE- mPEG) were kindly provided from
Lipoid (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Lissamine™ Rhodamine
B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(Rh-PE, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands),
cholesterol (Chol, Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)
and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[N-succinimidylester (polyethylene-glycol)-2000] (DSPEPEG-NHS, Nanocs, New York, USA) were furthermore
used for preparation of liposomes as well as Chol-PEGNHS which was synthesized in our lab. As sterically
stabilized formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin the
commercially available Caelyx® (Doxil®) (Janssen-Cilag
GmbH, Neuss, Germany) was used. The monoclonal
antibody to CD221 (IGF1-receptor alpha chain, 1H7 clone)
was purchased from Acris Antibodies (Hiddenhausen,
Germany), the human anti-GD2 antibody (hu 14.18)
was a generous gift from Prof. Dr. Rupert Handgretinger
(University Children’s Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen,
Germany) Moreover, the unspecific IgG antibody from
Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) was used.

The surface of preformed liposomes was modified
using either the sterol-based post-insertion technique
[40] [43, 44] or the lipid-based post-insertion technique
[40, 45, 46]. Either succinimide-activated Chol-PEG2000NHS [40] or DSPE-PEG2000-NHS [40] was used as anchor.
In brief, the ab solution (4–10 µg/µl) was pipetted into an
anchor coated vial resulting in an ab/anchor ratio of 1 to 50
(mol/mol). The mixture was vortexed and bath sonicated
for 30 s following incubation at 17°C under shaking
(700 rpm). After 15 min the reaction was stopped by
adding a 50 fold molar excess of histidine (in HBS,
20 g/l). After 10 min preformed liposomes were added in
an anchor to total lipid ratio of 1 to 20 for SPC/Chol and
1:80 for HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG liposomes, vortexed
and depending on liposome composition and anchor type
incubated as stated in Table 1.
For cellular experiments, free ab-anchor conjugate
was removed via size exclusion chromatography
(Sepharose CL-4B), using the liposomal external buffer as
eluent. Subsequently lipid concentration was determined
by colorimetric phosphate assay according to Bartlett [47].
Total lipid concentration was corrected with regard to
lipids not containing phosphate groups (e.g. Cholesterol).
When modifiying Caelyx® as liposomal dispersion for
in vivo studies, all steps were performed aseptically under
laminar flow and no separation step of free ab-anchor
conjugate was performed.

Liposome preparation
Liposomes for in vitro use were prepared by lipid
film hydration method. They were either composed
of SPC/Chol in a molar ratio of 7:3 or of HSPC/

Stability of doxorubicin encapsulation after
surface modification

Cellular association and uptake of liposomes
One hour before incubation, medium was renewed.
Cells were incubated for 2 hours with different liposomal
preparations resulting in a lipid concentration of 150 µM.
Subsequently, medium was removed, cells were washed
with PBS and detached using Trypsin 0.5%/EDTA 0.25%
(both from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). For experiments
using anti GD2 ab modified liposomes all supernatants
were collected and transferred into tubes together with
the harvested cells, as gangliosides play a role in cell
adhesion [49]. When cells were treated with liposomes
modified with an anti IGF1-R ab (1H7) only harvested
cells were collected. Cells were spun down for 4 min at
1 200 rpm and 4°C, washed once with PBS and after a
second centrifugation step resuspended in 200 µl PBS
containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells were kept at 4°C until
analysis via flow cytometry (FACS CaliburTM, Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Results obtained were
analyzed using CellQuestTM Pro Software. To determine
whether interaction of surface modified liposomes is due
to an interaction with the IGF1-R, 30 min bevor adding
the liposomal preparation free 1H7 ab was incubated with
BON cells in different concentrations (7, 14, 21 µg/ml).
For confocal microscopy, cells were washed twice after
incubation and fixed with 4% (m/V) paraformaldehyde
solution for 20 min at 37°C. Consecutively, cells were
washed and nuclei were DAPI stained (150 nM, 5 min),
washed again twice, mounted using MobiGLOW
Mounting Medium and placed on microscope slides.
Confocal Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM
510 Meta microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images
were taking using a C‑Apochromat 63x/1.2 W korr.
Objective and analyzed via ZEN 2011 software.

To determine the stability of encapsulated Dox in
Caelyx® liposomes after surface modification, 2.5 µl
of surface modified or unmodified Caelyx® liposomal
dispersion were added to 3 ml pre-heated HBS. The
measurement was performed at 37°C under constantly
stirring, all values were buffer background corrected.
Fluorescence was measured at exc. 480 nm/em. 590 nm
(slit 5 nm, LS 50 B, Perkin Elmer). As intraliposomal Dox
fluorescence is quenched due to the high concentration,
values only represent fluorescence of extraliposomal Dox
(I0). Liposomes were destroyed by adding 10 µl of 10%
(v/v) Triton X-100 and fluorescence of total Dox (I100%)
was determined. Encapsulation efficiency (EE [%]) was
calculated as EE [%] = 100 − (I0 / I100% × 100). The storage
stability at 4°C of surface modified Caelyx® liposomes
regarding EE of Dox was determined after 1 and 6 weeks,
respectively.

Cell culture
As in vitro model system the GD2 positive human
neuroblastoma cell line (Kelly) was used. Kelly cells were
obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms
and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany)
and cultured in VLE RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom,
Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat
inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, PAN-Biotech,
Aidenbach, Germany). As IGF1-R expressing in vitro
and in vivo GEP-NET model the human BON cell line
was used. BON cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATTC) and cultured in DMEM/
Ham’s F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. Cells
were maintained at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2 and
95% of humidity. One day before the experiment, cells
were seeded into 24-well culture plates at a density of
1.2 × 105 (Kelly) or 8 × 104 [48] cells/well, respectively.
For confocal microscopy experiments, BON cells were
seeded 24 h prior to the experiment on with 0.2% gelatin
(in PBS) coated sterile cover glasses in a 24 well plate.

Lyophilisation of ab-anchor conjugate
Ab-anchor conjugate was prepared as stated
above with the difference, that all steps were performed
aseptically under laminar flow and only sterile solutions
were used. After the reaction with histidine the obtained
ab-anchor conjugate was divided into several vials and
43708

Oncotarget

placed in the lyophilisator. Samples were frozen for
3 h at −45°C and ambient pressure followed by drying
steps for 42 h at −20°C and subsequently for 6 h at 30°C
under 0,05 mbar, respectively. Afterwards samples were
stored at 4°C. Before usage they were rehydrated using
purified water in an appropriate volume followed by
insertion into preformed SPC/Chol liposomes. Suitability
of lyophilisation for preservation of ab-anchor conjugates
was evaluated via evaluation of targeting efficiency
in vitro.

All experiments were carried out following protocols
approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern and in
accordance with the German guidelines for animal studies.

Statistical analyses
All results for the in vitro experiments are expressed
as mean ± SEM unless stated otherwise. Statistical
significance was determined using the one way ANOVA
test (OriginPro software). Statistical significance is
denoted as stars (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001) in
the figures if not stated otherwise.
Statistical significance for the in vivo experiments
was determined by survival curve analysis using Prizm
software (Houston, TX). Statistical significance is denoted
as stars (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001) in the
figures if not stated otherwise.

Buffer exchange of preformed liposomes
External buffer of preformed liposomes was
exchanged by using a vivaspin device (100 kDa cut
off, PES membrane, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany).
Liposomes prepared in SH buffer were added into vivaspin
tubes, spun down corresponding to manufacturer’s
protocol and washed three times with buffer stated as
liposomal external buffer. Afterwards liposomes were
removed and surface was modified as described.

Therapeutic experiments
Female athymic NMRI nu/nu mice (6–8 weeks)
were purchased from Harlan Winkelmann (Borchen,
Germany) and housed under pathogen-free conditions.
For tumor induction 15 × 106 BON1 cells in a volume
of 200 µl PBS were inoculated for tumor development
subcutaneously into the neck of each mouse. BON
cells were cultured as previously described [19]. For
therapeutic experiments sterically stabilized liposomal
doxorubicin (Caelyx®) was used as basal formulation. For
immunoliposomal preparations the surface was modified
via SPIT as stated above utilizing 1H7-antibody in a
concentration of 10 µg/µl, resulting in Caelyx®-1H7. All
steps were performed aseptically under laminar flow. As
control treatment, first free ab-anchor conjugate and with
a time lag unmodified Caelyx® liposomes (designated
as Caelyx® + Chol-PEG-1H7) were applied. For abanchor conjugate preparation all steps were performed
as described above unless liposome addition was omitted
and dilution for administration was performed with sterile
HBS resulting in a final volume of about 100–200 µl.
Therapeutic treatments were applied intravenously for
all groups (n = 7) at days 7, 17, 25 and 33 after BON
tumor induction in dosages of 10 mg/kg body weight
for sterically stabilized liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx®)
and 3.9 mg/kg for 1H7 antibody or the respective
immunoliposomal preparation Caelyx®-1H7. To avoid
methodological artefacts due to spontaneous aggregation,
Caelyx® + 1H7 were injected with a time delay of a few
minutes into the same mouse. Antitumor effects were
registered by measuring the longest tumor diameter.
Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when the
tumors reached a longest tumor diameter of 15 mm.
