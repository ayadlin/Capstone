ABSTRACT
Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) has generated remarkable responses in CLL. However,
the drug, to a large extent, does not cause cell death directly and does not eradicate CLL
malignant clones. Inability to eradicate CLL has fostered resistance generation. Once
patients become resistant, they do poorly with a median survival of 3-4 months. Novel
therapeutic strategies are needed to prevent resistance, improve treatment outcome
and ultimately cure the disease. Herein, we explore dual targeting of the BCR and
JAK-STAT pathways with a novel single agent, cerdulatinib, which selectively inhibits
both SYK (a BCR component) and JAK kinases. We demonstrated that cerdulatinib
delivered potent tumor inhibition in 60 primary CLL patient samples, especially in
those with poor prognostic indicators. Importantly, cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib,
is able to overcome the support of microenvironment and induces CLL cell death at
clinically achievable concentrations. Notably, cerdulatinib blocked proliferation of
ibrutinib-resistant primary CLL cells and of BTKC481S-transfected/ibrutinib-resistant
lymphoma cells. These anti-tumor effects are well correlated with the inhibition of
BCR and JAK-STAT signaling and downstream inhibition of the functions of AKT, ERK
and NFκB. Collectively, our results show that simultaneous targeting of BCR and JAKSTAT pathways is a more effective strategy relative to single BTK inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

Despite ibrutinib’s anti-tumor activity across
multiple lymphoid malignancies, clinical observations
and ex-vivo studies including ours suggest that ibrutinib
does not induce a significant degree of CLL cell death at
clinically achievable concentrations [6-9] and thereby
has a low potential to eradicate residual disease. Lack of
cell death may account for the single-digit low complete
response rate [10] and the persistence of circulating CLL
cells beyond 12-months of ibrutinib treatment in some
cases [10, 11]. The lack of effective killing provides tumor
cells a window of opportunity to mutate and escape drug
suppression. BTKC481S mutation, identified by our group
and others, arises commonly in patients who relapse on
ibrutinib [12-14]. Although the reported frequency of
overall resistance remains relatively low at < 10% [15, 16],

Increased BCR signaling is considered one of the
most important driving pathologic mechanisms leading to
CLL development, progression and relapse. BCR-targeted
therapies including ibrutinib (ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor)
have generated remarkable responses in treating mature
B-cell malignancies including CLL[1-5]. Ibrutinib, in
particular, was approved by the FDA in February 2014
as a breakthrough therapy for relapsed/refractory CLL, in
July 2014 as a frontline therapy for high-risk CLL with
17p deletion and most recently in March 2016 as the first
chemotherapy-free treatment for both treatment-naïve and
previously treated patients.

clinical experience with ibrutinib is relatively short. It is
foreseeable that the incidence of observed resistance will
increase as clinical use outside clinical trials spreads over
time. Besides resistance, ~25% of patients discontinue
ibrutinib due to lack of tolerability or efficacy resulting in
high fatality [15, 16]. Thus, there continues to be an urgent
medical need for new therapeutic options.
Simultaneous targeting of multiple oncogenic
pathways is a strategy to prevent and reduce the overall
incidence of drug resistance and to potentially drive higher
complete response rates [46]. Besides the BCR pathway,
JAK-STAT represents another important tumor-promoting
signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL [17-20].
Numerous cytokine/chemokine stimuli released from
the tissue microenvironment and CLL cells themselves
promote the growth and survival of the malignant cells.
The cytokines include, but are not limited to, IL-4, and IL6, that act through cytokine receptors and JAK kinases to
phosphorylate and activate STAT6 or STAT3, respectively.
STAT activation subsequently up-regulates anti-apoptotic
proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL, increases cell survival and
confers CLL resistance to cytotoxic agents. [21-23]
Cerdulatinib is a novel orally available, ATPcompetitive, small-molecule inhibitor that demonstrates
selective inhibition of SYK and JAK kinases with IC50
of 32 nM for SYK and 0.5-12 nM for JAKs [24]. Its
selectivity in the cellular context was also demonstrated
by the lack of inhibition of T-cell receptor signaling or
protein kinase C signaling in whole blood [24]. In a
mouse model, it blocks B-cell activation and alleviates
splenomegaly induced by chronic BCR stimulation [24].
In human lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma
cells, cerdulatinib demonstrates broad anti-tumor activity
in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma including GCB and ABC
tumor cells with ibrutinib-resistant MYD88 or CARD11
mutations [25] . In CLL, we showed that cerdulatinib
blocks proliferation of BTKC48S-bearing ibrutinib-resistant
cells isolated from an ibrutinib-relapsed patient [14].
Herein, we further investigate the effects of dual SYK
and JAK inhibition in a collection of 60 CLL patient
samples in comparison to ibrutinib. We demonstrate that
cerdulatinib has additional anti-tumor activities compared
to ibrutinib and the compound shows great potential in
overcoming ibrutinib resistance.

CLL ranged from 0.37 to 10.02 µM (Figure 1A) and the
dose responses for all samples are shown in Figure 1B.
The average IC50 of cerdulatinib for the cohort was 2.57
μM and median IC50 was 1.49 μM. These concentrations
are clinically achievable according to a recent clinical
pharmacokinetic study [26]. Using 2 μM of cerdulatinib,
a time course of drug treatment was performed and a
time-dependent reduction in cell viability was observed
(Figure 1C, left). Notably, this anti-survival effect is
selective for CLL tumor cells but not for normal B cells
(Figure 1C, right). We then analyzed whether cell killing
by cerdulatinib differs among CLL subgroups stratified
by known prognostic factors. We found that CLLs with
unmutated IGHV versus mutated IGHV have lower
IC50s and thus were more sensitive to cerdulatinib (P =
0.0395, Supplementary Figure 1A). CLLs with high or
intermediate risk cytogenetic abnormalities including del
(11q)/ trisomy 12/del(17p) were also more sensitive to
cerdulatinib than those with low risk features including
del (13q) or normal cytogenetics (Supplementary Figure
1B). Although there was a trend for ZAP70 positive
cases to be more sensitive to cerdulatinib, the difference
between the ZAP70 positive or negative subgroups did not
reach statistical significance (Supplementary Figure 1C).
Meanwhile, cerdulatinib sensitivity did not differ among
samples from patients with different sex, different Rai
stage, or different treatment status (treated vs untreated)
(data not shown). Overall, we found that CLL cells are
sensitive to cerdulatinib, especially in cases with poor
prognosis by IGHV and cytogenetics.

Cerdulatinib induces apoptosis in association with
MCL-1 down-regulation and PARP cleavage
We next investigated if apoptosis induction is
one of the mechanisms of CLL cytotoxicity induced
by cerdulatinib. CLL cells were treated with different
concentrations of cerdulatinib and apoptosis events were
measured with Annexin V/7-AAD staining. Results of
three representative cases are shown in Figure 2A and
aggregate results of eight cases are shown in Figure
2B. Dose-dependent apoptosis was observed in all CLL
samples tested. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic protein
MCL-1 was reduced by cerdulatinib in a dose-dependent
fashion that was accompanied by dose-dependent
increases of PARP cleavage (Figure 2C). Overall, the data
show that cerdulatinib reduces CLL survival through the
induction of apoptosis.

RESULTS
CLL is sensitive to cerdulatinib especially in cases
with poor prognosis

Cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, is able to
overcome the support of the microenvironment
and induce CLL cell death

We first determined sensitivity of a cohort of 60
CLL patient samples to cerdulatinib. We treated cells with
serial diluted cerdulatinib and measured cell viability after
72 hrs with propidium iodide flow cytometry. IC50 in 60

microenvironment. Cell-to-cell contact, as well as soluble
cytokines and chemokines, promote CLL survival/
proliferation and protect tumors cells from killing by antitumor agents [21, 27-30]. In order to determine whether
cerdulatinib is effective against CLL in the presence of
microenvironmental support, we first tested the effects
of cerdulatinib in two in vitro CLL co-culture models
mimicking the in vivo microenvironment. Addition of
2μM cerdulatinib significantly reduced CLL cell viability

throughout the 7-day course, even when cells were cocultured over either NKTert or HS-5, human bone marrow
stromal cell lines (Figure 3A). The anti-survival effect
became more pronounced as the dose of cerdulatinib was
escalated from 1 to 4 uM with both models (Figure 3B).
Our previous studies showed that ibrutinib, at a
clinically achievable concentration of 500 nM (in human
Cmax is 408 nM [1]), had little effect on cell survival with
stromal co-culture [9, 14]. We compared viabilities of cells

treated with either cerdulatinib or ibrutinib in the presence
of previously defined CLL survival signals. Cmax for each
drug was used for such comparison (2 µM for cerdulatinib
and 0.5 µM for ibrutinib). The results confirmed that
ibrutinib did not affect cell viability whereas cerdulatinib
consistently induced significant cytotoxicity in the
presence of combined αIgM+ IL4+CD40L (Figure 3C).
Taken together with the co-culture experiments, these
results demonstrate that cerdulatinib is able to overcome
the protective signals from the tumor microenvironment
and reduce CLL cell viability under several tested
conditions.

synthesizing CLL population can be detected [6, 9, 14].
Using this model, we have shown that one of the primary
effects of ibrutinib is to block cell proliferation [6]. We
then tested the effects of cerdulatinib. Two representative
cases and results from an aggregate of 12 cases are
shown in Figure 4A. Nearly complete blockade of CLL
proliferation was achieved at 250-500 nM of cerdulatinib.
These results were reproduced with a combined
stimulation model in which a mixture of anti-IgM, IL4,
CD40L and CpG were used to promote CLL proliferation
(Figure 4B). Thus, CLL proliferation is very sensitive to
cerdulatinib inhibition in both CLL proliferation models.

resistant cases. Primary cells isolated from patients who
responded to ibrutinib in vivo were treated with either
ibrutinib or cerdulatinib in vitro under the condition
of combined stimulation. Shown in Figure 4C, these
cells responded equally well to either drug at a low and
clinically achievable concentration. We then performed
similar experiments on cells isolated from three ibrutinibrelapsed patients. These samples carry BTK mutations
that confer ibrutinib resistance. Two of the patients had
the known BTKC481S mutation [12, 14] and one other
patient had BTKT316A [31]. When these mutated cells were
tested against ibrutinib and cerdulatinib, a significant
number of BrdU+ CLL cells remained following ibrutinib
treatment, whereas cerdulatinib almost completely
blocked the appearance of BrdU+ cell populations in all
three cases (Figure 4D, middle vs. right column). These

experiments demonstrate that cerdulatinib not only blocks
cell proliferation in ibrutinib-sensitive but also ibrutinibresistant CLL cells.
To test whether cerdulatinib directly suppresses the
growth of ibrutinib-resistant cells, we constructed and
cloned both BTKC481S and wild type BTK (WT) expression
vectors and then transfected them into the ibrutinibsensitive lymphoma cell line TMD8. We assessed cell
growth following exposure to ibrutinib or cerdulatinib.
Figure 4E showed that the growth of WT BTK -transfected
TMD8 cells was similarly inhibited by both ibrutinib and
cerdulatinib at 250 nM (Left panel, compare blue and
red curves). However, BTKC481S-transfected cells were
less sensitive to ibrutinib, as expected. (Figure 4E, right,
blue vs green curves). Meanwhile, growth of these cells
was effectively blocked by cerdulatinib (Figure 4E, right,

red), similar to the block observed in WT BTK cells (Left
panel). Taken together with our primary cell results (Figure
4C & 4D), these data demonstrate that cerdulatinib is
capable of overcoming BTK mutation-mediated ibrutinib
resistance with respect to cell growth and proliferation.

JAK1, JAK3 and STAT6, components of IL-4 signal
transduction, were clearly inhibited by cerdulatinib in a
concentration-dependent manner, while total JAK1/3 and
STAT6 remained relatively constant. When CLL cells
were stimulated with IL6, phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2
and STAT3, components of IL-6 signal transduction, were
also inhibited by cerdulatinib in a concentration-dependent
manner, while total proteins remained largely unchanged
(Figure 5D). Together, these studies demonstrate that
cerdulatinib inhibits BCR and cytokine-dependent
signaling pathways in CLL.

Cerdulatinib effectively blocks BCR and JAKSTAT signaling
To better understand the molecular mechanism
of cerdulatinib’s action, we examined the activities
of key BCR enzymes in cerdulatinib-treated cells.
In vitro cultured CLL cells were treated with various
concentrations of cerdulatinib in the presence of combined
stimulation. Phosphorylation of SYK at Tyr 525, which
reflects SYK activity, was inhibited by cerdulatinib in a
concentration- dependent fashion in most cases, while
total SYK remained constant (Figure 5A). Similarly, BTK
phosphorylation at Tyr 551 (phosphorylated by SYK [32,
33]) and Tyr 223 (BTK autophosphorylation which reflects
BTK activity [32, 33]) were also inhibited effectively by
cerdulatinib in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure
5A).
We then analyzed the phosphorylation of PLCγ2, a
substrate of BTK, with phospho-specific flow cytometry.
As shown with four representative cases (Figure 5B),
phosphorylation of PLCγ2 increased dramatically upon
combined stimulation (black open peak vs grey shaded
peak) and this increase in phosphorylation was reduced by
cerdulatinib treatment, even to a level below the baseline
in some cases (Figure 5B Left, dot-outlined peak vs black
open peak). Data generated from an aggregate of 43
cases show that the increase by stimulation and decrease
by cerdulatinib treatment are statistically significant
(Figure 5B middle). Notably, an inverse correlation can
be demonstrated between cerdulatinib IC50 (See Figure
1A) and degree of p-PLCγ2 inhibition (n = 43) showing
that a greater inhibition of the lipase activity is correlated
with a higher degree of cellular inhibition (Figure 5B
right). These results on SYK, BTK and PLCγ2 indicate
collectively that the anti-tumor activity of cerdulatinib
correlates well with its inhibition of BCR signaling
activity.
Cytokines play important roles in promoting CLL
survival in bone marrow or lymph nodes through JAKSTAT pathway. The cytokines include, but not limited
to, IL4 and IL6, that act through cytokine receptors and
JAK kinases to phosphorylate and activate STAT3 or
STAT6. STAT activation subsequently leads to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL
and increases cell survival. We thus investigated whether
cerdulatinib is able to suppress the pathway activation
triggered by these cytokines. CLL cells stimulated
with IL4 were treated with different concentrations of
cerdulatinib. Figure 5C shows that phosphorylation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Inhibition of SYK and JAK by cerdulatinib
translates to downstream inhibition of AKT and
ERK
BCR or cytokine signaling directly or indirectly
leads to downstream activation of AKT and ERK [6, 21,
24]. We thus examined whether activity of AKT and ERK
was inhibited by cerdulatinib. Phosphorylation of AKT
and ERK was assessed by phospho-flow, a sensitive and
quantitative assay. As illustrated with four representative
cases in Figure 6A, activity of AKT and ERK was
significantly increased by combined stimulation (black
open peak vs grey shaded peak), and this increase was
significantly reduced or even completely abolished by
cerdulatinib (dot-outlined peak vs black open peak). Data
derived from 43 CLL cases were summarized (Figure 6B
top). Similar to PLCγ2, the degree of both p-AKT and
p-ERK inhibition is inversely correlated with the IC50 of
cerdulatinib in 43 CLL samples suggesting the anti-tumor
effect of cerdulatinib relates to its inhibition of distal
signal transducers AKT and ERK (Figure 6B bottom).
We also analyzed the quantitative relationship between
the degree of p-PLCγ2, p-AKT and p-ERK inhibition.
Statistical analysis revealed a significant linear intercorrelation between all three parameters suggesting the
three signaling molecules are interrelated in the same
network that is inhibited by cerdulatinib (Figure 6C).

Cerdulatinib inhibits the activity of NF-kB
pathway
BCR signaling ultimately results in NFκB activation.
BCR-mediated activation of IKKβ phosphorylates IkBα
leading to its degradation and subsequent release of p65
and p50 from an inhibitory complex. Activated P65/
P50 then translocates to the nucleus and activates its
target genes essential for cell activation, survival, and
proliferation[34]. We first interrogated the phosphorylation
of IκBα in whole cell lysate following cerdulatinib
treatment. Figure 7A shows that stimulation of CLL
cells (n = 4) with either αIgM or combined stimuli (sti)
induced IκBα phosphorylation in three of four samples
tested (CLL011, CLL067 and CLL311), while cerdulatinib

treatment reduced IκBα phosphorylation in all samples.
Figure 7B further demonstrates that inhibition of IκBα
phosphorylation occurred in a concentration-dependent
manner in whole cell lysates with concomitant reduction
of nuclear p65 (Figure 7B & 7C). Together, these results
suggest that p65 was trapped in the cytoplasmic inhibitory
complex with unphosphorylated IkBα upon cerdulatinib
treatment. We then further interrogated the DNA
binding activity of NFkB subunit p50 using an ELISA
assay. Figure 7D shows the dose-dependent reduction
of p50 activity following cerdulatinib treatment. Taken
together, multiple experiments clearly demonstrate that
cerdulatinib inhibits the function of the NF-kB pathway

from cytoplasm to nucleus.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we evaluated the efficacy of
cerdulatinib in a cohort of 60 CLL patient samples and
found that the compound is effective against CLL cells
at clinically achievable low concentrations that generate
little toxicity in normal B cells (Figure 1). We also found
that CLL cases with unmutated IGHV are more sensitive
to cerdulatinib, which is consistent with our previous
results that this subtype of CLL has higher intrinsic BCR
activity rendering them more vulnerable to BCR-targeted

therapy [9]. In addition, we found that high-risk CLL by
cytogenetic abnormalities including cases with del (11q)
and del (17p) are more sensitive to cerdulatinib. Although
the results are statistically significant, the findings will
need to be confirmed with a larger number of cases.
Notably, through a side-by-side comparison,
cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, induced apoptosis of
tumor cells in the presence of stromal co-culture and in
the presence of combined micro-environmental stimuli
including IL-4, CD40L and anti-IgM (Figure 3). These
results are in line with our previous in vitro study as well
as in vivo study that demonstrated lack of significant
apoptosis induction by ibrutinib in patients receiving
the therapy [6, 9]. Apoptosis induction by cerdulatinib is
remarkable as the class of BCR-directed agents display

limited capacity of apoptosis induction ( < 20%) in the
presence of stromal protection at clinically achievable
concentrations. Besides ibrutinib, these include dasatinib
[35, 36], SYK inhibitors [37-40]. Several published
reports that observed >20% apoptosis with these agents
were conducted in the absence of stromal support and/or
at clinically irrelevant high concentrations when the study
drug hits many unintended molecular targets. Clinical
observations also seem to support lack of apoptosis, as
complete responses to BCR-directed agents are rare [4144].
These results are also similar to what we have
previously found in DLBCL. Cerdulatinib induces
apoptosis in addition to causing cell cycle arrest in primary

is again superior compared to several drugs in the class of
BCR-targeted therapies such as LYN and SYK inhibitors
[35, 37]. Further, cerdulatinib kills DLBCL cell lines that
carry MYD88, CARD11 or A20 mutations which imparts
resistance to ibrutinib [25].
The ability of cerdulatinib to induce CLL apoptosis
was demonstrated in a recent study by Blunt et al [45]. It
has been shown that: 1) Cerdulatinib inhibits BCR-induced
signaling; 2) Cerdulatinib inhibits chemokine secretion
in response to BCR ligation and co-culture with nurselike cells; 3) IL-4 mediated signalling and increased IgM
expression are inhibited by cerdulatinib; 4) Cerdulatinib
reduces CLL cell viability in a concentration, time and
caspase dependent manner; 5) Cerdulatinib reduces cell
viability in the presence of microenvironmental support
and 6) Cerdulatinib and venetoclax synergize to induces
substantial apoptosis in the presence of IL- 4/CD40L. Our
investigation largely confirmed these findings. However,
we further advanced our understanding of mechanisms of
action by showing: 1) Cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, is
able to overcome the support of the microenvironment and
induce CLL cell death; 2) Cerdulatinib blocks proliferation
of primary CLL cells in our unique model that promotes
CLL proliferation; 3) Cerdulatinib blocks proliferation
not only in ibrutinib-sensitive CLL cells, but also in
ibrutinib-resistant primary cells harboring the known BTK
mutations; 4) Cerdulatinib blocks growth of lymphoma
cells rendered ibrutinib-resistant by the introduction of
BTKC481S; 5) Cerdulatinib effectively inhibits JAK-STAT
signaling (this was shown not only with IL-4 signaling
but also with IL-6 signaling); 6) Cerdulatinib inhibits the
activity of NF-kB pathway.
In addition to these unique findings, we tested
the effects of cerdulatinib in a larger cohort of 60 CLL
samples while no more than 12 samples were studied at a
time for each experiment described in the published report
[45]. Further, we demonstrated with stronger evidence
that cerdulatinib effectively blocks BCR signaling. We
showed, with 43 cases, extensive quantitative inverse
correlations between cerdulatinib IC50 and the degree
of inhibition of p-PLCγ2, p-AKT and p-ERK as well as
pair-wise correlation between the degree of inhibition
of p-PLCγ2, p-AKT and p-ERK. We thus demonstrated
that the three BCR signaling molecules are interrelated
in the same network that is inhibited by cerdulatinib.
Overall, the two investigations are complementary to
each other. The current study has delivered a new message
showing that cerdulatinib overcomes ibrutinib resistance
with underlying mechanistic insights supporting such a
statement.
The pro-apoptotic activity of cerdulatinib is likely
related to its ability to inhibit JAK-STAT pathway.
Previous studies have shown that IL4 and IL6-induced
STAT activation up-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins
MCL-1 and BCL-xL, increase cell survival and confers
CLL resistance to cytotoxic agents [21],[23]. Herein, we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have shown that cerdulatinib effectively inhibited IL4induced phosphorylation of JAK1/3 and STAT6. It also
inhibited IL6-induced phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and
STAT3 (Figure 6) with ultimate inhibition of MCL-1 and
induction of PARP cleavage (Figure 2). Thus, our data
are consistent with the previous cytokine studies and
further suggest that cerdulatinib targets cytokine-induced
signaling and antagonizes micro-environment-mediated
CLL survival.
With wider use of ibrutinib the number of ibrutinibresistant patients is likely to grow. With this comes
increasing demand for alternative therapeutic agents
for relapsed patients who bear very poor outcomes.
The mechanisms of resistance are diverse, thus,
simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways shows
promise as an alternative therapy [46]. With its ability to
induce apoptosis, cerdulatinib has the potential to serve
as a more effective therapy for CLL and other B-cell
lymphomas in general. Phase I clinical trial is ongoing.
Preliminary results in patients with relapsed/refractory
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL displayed promising
anti-tumor activity and an acceptable safety profile [47]
(NCT01994382). In vitro findings reported herein will be
confirmed by correlative studies that will be conducted in
parallel to the upcoming phase II trial of cerdulatinib in
relapsed/refractory CLL patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Healthy donor and CLL samples
Peripheral blood samples of 60 CLL patients were
collected for this study and informed consents were
obtained from all patients according to the Declaration of
Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the Weill Cornell Medical College and University of
Chicago. CLL diagnosis was based on the clinical and
immunophenotypic criteria outlined by IWCLL criteria
[48]. Patient characteristics are listed in supplemental
Table 1. Patients investigated had not received any
treatment for a period of at least 3 months before sample
collection.

vectors were generated using the QuikChange II SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cedar
Creek, TX, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
The identity of the mutant constructs was confirmed by
Sanger sequencing.

Cell transfection, cell count, viability and survival
assay
TMD8 cells were transfected with constructs of WT
BTK or BTKC481S mutants using kit V, Program U-13 on
Amaxa Nucleofector, according to the manufacturer’s
protocols (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). After transfection,
the cells were co-cultured with NKTert cells in a 24-well
plate for 24 hrs for recovery. Ibrutinib, cerdulatinib and
vehicle (DMSO) were then added into the transfected
TMD8 cells and cellular viability was determined with
Muse™ Count & Viability kit using Muse Cell Analyzer
(Millipore, Hayward, CA, USA). The cell survival was
determined by flow cytometry using the Annexin V/7AAD Apoptosis Detection Kit I on freshly isolated
CLL cells following manufacturer’s instructions (BD
Biosciences).

CLL cell isolation and culture
CLL cells were purified using the Human B cell
Enrichment Cocktail Kit (StemCell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada) and were stained with anti-CD5/
CD19 for verification of the purity, which was greater
than 95% for all cases. Isolated CLL cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 with 15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY, USA), penicillin (100 IU), and streptomycin
(100 μg/mL), at a density of 1x107 cells/mL in the presence
or absence of 2.5 mg/mL CpG , 100 ng/mL CD40L, 10ng/
mL IL-4. Anti-IgM stimulation was conducted with platebound anti-IgM (10 μg/mL). Specific conditions for each
experiment are described in the corresponding figure
legends. CLL cells were stimulated with IL-6 (10 ng/mL)
to detect the phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK2 and STAT3.

Analysis of NF-κB activity
Nuclear extracts were obtained from six purified
CLL samples and assayed for NF-κB activity using the
TransAM p50 transcription factor assay (Active Motif,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). According to the manufacturer’s
protocol, 2 µg of nuclear extracts were added to a 96-well
plate pre-coated with oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus DNA-binding site (5’-GGGACTTTCC-3’).
DNA binding was then detected by p50 primary antibody
followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody.

Co-culture conditions
Human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 was
obtained from ATCC and NK-Tert (NKTert) was kindly
provided by Dr. Jan A. Burger (M.D. Anderson), CLL
cell and stromal cell co-culture assays were described
previously [9, 14]. Briefly, stromal cells were seeded at a
concentration of 5x104 cells/per well in 24-well plates and
were incubated for 24 hours to allow cells to adhere. CLL
cells were then added to the culture at a ratio of 100:1 (5
x106cells/mL) on confluent layers of stromal cells in RPMI
medium. CLL cells were harvested by gentle pipetting,
leaving the adherent stromal cell layer intact.

Statistical analysis
Student’s paired t-test was used for analyzing the
statistical significance between two sample groups and
one-way ANOVA was used for multi-group comparison.
Spearman correlation was performed for correlation
studies. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Graphpad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
