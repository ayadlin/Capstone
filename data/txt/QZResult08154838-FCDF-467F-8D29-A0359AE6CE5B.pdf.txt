ABSTRACT
Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one third of liposarcomas and about
10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. The tumors are characterized by specific
chromosomal translocations leading to the chimeric oncogenes FUS-DDIT3 or EWS1RDDIT3. The encoded fusion proteins act as aberrant transcription factors. Therefore,
we implemented comparative expression analyses using whole-genome microarrays in
tumor and fat tissue samples. We aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes
which may serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers or as therapeutic targets.
Microarray analyses revealed overexpression of FGFR2 and other members of the FGF/
FGFR family. Overexpression of FGFR2 was validated by qPCR, immunohistochemistry
and western blot analysis in primary tumor samples. Treatment of the myxoid
liposarcoma cell lines MLS 402 and MLS 1765 with the FGFR inhibitors PD173074,
TKI258 (dovitinib) and BGJ398 as well as specific siRNAs reduced cell proliferation,
induced apoptosis and delayed cell migration. Combination of FGFR inhibitors with
trabectedin further increased the effect. Our study demonstrates overexpression
of FGFR2 and a functional role of FGFR signaling in myxoid liposarcoma. As FGFR
inhibition showed effects on proliferation and cell migration and induced apoptosis
in vitro, our data indicate the potential use of FGFR inhibitors as a targeted therapy
for these tumors.

INTRODUCTION

on chromosome 12 affecting among others the genes
MDM2 and CDK4 [4]. Likewise, myxoid and round cell
liposarcomas are considered as a common tumor entity
which is characterized by a reciprocal translocation of the
DDIT3 gene with either FUS (>90%) or EWS1R [5-8]. The
translocations t(12;16)(q13;p11) and accordingly t(12;22)
(q13;p12) are specific for this tumor entity and absent in
other myxoid look-alikes such as myxofibrosarcoma [9].
The translocation leads to the fusion of the involved genes
and the formation of a chimeric protein.
Besides the initial translocation only little is known
about tumorigenic pathways deregulated by the chimeric

Liposarcomas are rare malignant tumors that
preferentially occur in deep soft tissue. However,
representing 10-15% of all soft tissue sarcomas they are
one of the most frequent sarcoma subtypes [1]. Based on
histological and cytogenetic properties, liposarcomas can
be distinguished into three different entities, i.e. welldifferentiated/dedifferentiated (WD/DDLPS), myxoid/
round cell (MRLPS) as well as pleomorphic liposarcomas
(PLPS) [2, 3]. WD/DDLPS are genetically defined by
giant marker or ring chromosomes with an amplification

protein [10]. As the DDIT3 fusion proteins are most likely
to act as aberrant transcription factors, the transcriptional
control of many genes may be altered. Such differentially
expressed genes could be diagnostic or prognostic
biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. In order to
identify multiple differentially expressed genes at the same
time, cDNA microarrays are particularly suitable. They
have already been performed in different sarcoma entities
and revealed subtype specific expression signatures
as well as basis for novel therapeutic approaches [1115]. Nevertheless, the identification of candidate target
structures based on gene expression profiling alone does
not provide reliable evidence for the implementation
of new therapeutic strategies. Rather, results need to be
carefully validated and functional studies have to confirm
the suitability of identified candidates.
Treatment of liposarcomas with the new
chemotherapeutic compound trabectedin (ET-743)
revealed promising results [16, 17], but molecularly
targeted therapies are not yet available. For other soft
tissue sarcomas some success with targeted therapies
has been achieved in specific subtypes, but their
implementation remains far behind treatment regimes
in carcinomas [18, 19, 20]. An interesting family of
receptor tyrosine kinases that can successfully be targeted
and whose role in tumorigenesis has been revealed for
different sarcoma entities are fibroblast growth factor
receptors (FGFRs). FGFR1 amplification has been
described in osteosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas were
identified to carry activating mutations in FGFR4 [21,
22]. Furthermore, activation of FGFR signaling through
amplification of the adaptor FRS2 has recently been
described in high-grade liposarcomas [23].
The implementation of therapies with defined
molecular targets requires the identification of new key
molecules. Therefore, we implemented comparative
whole-genome microarray analyses in primary myxoid
liposarcomas and fat tissue samples. FGFR2, together
with other members of the FGF/FGFR family, showed
overexpression. FGFR2 expression was further analyzed
in primary tumors and myxoid liposarcoma cell lines
were treated with FGFR silencing siRNAs and tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. Inhibitors were additionally combined
with trabectedin. Our study investigates a potential role
of FGFR signaling in myxoid liposarcomas and the use of
FGFR inhibitors as a novel targeted treatment approach
for these tumors.

microarray analyses were performed with seven tumor
samples and an RNA pool of eight normal fat tissue
samples with excellent RNA quality (RNA integrity
number (RIN) value ≥ 7.0, Table 1 and Supplemental
Figure S1 A).
A principal component analysis (PCA) was
carried out to analyze the relative similarity between the
expression profiles. The PCA plot (Figure 1A) illustrates
a clear difference between the fat control pool and the
tumor samples, which show a high degree of similarity
among each other. Due to this similarity the tumor samples
were compared to the control as a whole. By means of
this comparison a multitude of differentially expressed
genes could be identified. We detected 7,946 genes with
significant twofold or more up- or down-regulation
(p-value < 0.01). Maximal measured fold changes were
±100. In the range of +80 to +100 and –80 to –100 were 26
genes, respectively. A heat map reflecting the differential
expression of several genes in MLS tumor samples
compared to normal fat tissue is given in Supplemental
Figure S1B.
All MLS samples included in the study were proven
to carry a DDIT3 translocation involving either FUS or
EWS1R using FISH analysis (Supplemental Figure S1C).
Additionally, in samples used for microarray analysis and
MLS cell lines the exact type of DDIT3 translocation was
determined by RT-PCR and sequencing (Supplemental
Table S1). In two tumor samples our analysis revealed
so far undescribed variants. Case MLS 12 carries both
fusion transcripts of type I and type III. For MLS 1 a
variant of type I lacking the last 24 codons of FUS exon
7 was identified. A correlation between the differential
expression of genes and the particular type of fusion
transcript was not detected.

Microarray validation and identification of
suitable reference genes
We analyzed the expression stability of 16 candidate
reference genes by means of qPCR using TaqMan® Array
Human Endogenous Control Panels in cryo-conserved and
formalin-fixed tumor tissue as well as in cryo-conserved
fat tissue samples. Data were analyzed using GeNorm
and NormFinder software tools, which both detected
comparable results. Expression stabilities generated with
GeNorm are shown in Supplemental Figure S2. Suitable
reference genes should exhibit stability values below 1.5,
which was seen in cryo-conserved tissue samples for all
genes apart from PGK1. In formalin-fixed tissue, stability
values for the candidate reference genes turned out to be
much higher. As the qPCR validation was also performed
in a cohort of formalin-fixed samples, these data were
considered preferentially for selection of reference
genes. IPO8 was among the two most stable reference
genes in all three tissue types and was therefore selected

By evaluating the microarray analyses multiple
genes expressed at significantly different levels were
identified. One of these genes was FGFR2, which was
highly overexpressed in myxoid liposarcoma. In addition
to FGFR2 also other members of the FGF/FGFR family
showed an overexpression in the microarray analyses
(Figure 2A) further reinforcing the potential role of FGFR
signaling in myxoid liposarcomas. In qPCR analyses
a clear up-regulation of FGFR2 gene expression was

was shown by qPCR 48 h after transfection (Supplemental
Figure S3). As both cell lines express all four FGFRs
(Figure 3A), the receptors were knocked-down separately
as well as in combination. Figure 3B shows apoptosis
induction upon FGFR silencing, either of FGFR1, 2, 3 and
4 alone or by combined knock-down of several receptors.
In MLS 402 single receptor silencing of FGFR2 induced
apoptosis, whereas knock-down of the other receptors
alone showed no effect (Figure 3B, left upper graph).
Accordingly, the combined knock-down of more than
one FGF receptor induced apoptosis only when FGFR2
siRNA was included (Figure 3B, left bottom graph). In
MLS 1765 cells knock-down of FGFRs induced apoptosis
as well, but to a lesser extent than in MLS 402. Silencing
of FGFR2 alone did not cause apoptosis, but apoptosis
induction was detected upon knock-down of either FGFR1
or FGFR3 (Figure 3B, right upper graph). In line with
this all combinations of different siRNAs including those
against FGFR1 and/or FGFR3 induced apoptosis in MLS
1765 cells (Figure 3B, right bottom graph).
In MLS 402 cells the combined silencing of
the four FGF receptors caused attenuation of ERK
mediated downstream signaling, shown by the reduced

phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure 3C). In MLS 1765
cells even single receptor silencing of either FGFR1 or
FGFR3 lead to a reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 3C). This result is in concordance with apoptosis
induction in MLS 1765 cells after silencing of FGFR1 or
FGFR3.

FGFR inhibition with small molecules
As silencing of FGF receptors with specific
siRNAs induced apoptosis in the myxoid liposarcoma
cell lines MLS 402 and MLS 1765, also the functional
effects of small molecules directed against FGFRs were
examined. Cells were treated with the in vitro compound
PD173074 (purchased from Sigma Aldrich) as well
as with the two clinically applicable FGFR inhibitors
dovitinib (TKI258) and BGJ398 (both from Novartis).
As shown in Figure 4A, viability of both cell lines was
reduced through FGFR inhibition by all three compounds
in a concentration dependent manner. IC50 values were
in the micromolar range and inhibitory effects could be
seen under serum-reduced as well as under full-serum
conditions. The detected effects upon FGFR inhibition

by TKI258 and BGJ398 on the viability of the MLS cell
lines were compared to those in a known FGFR inhibitor
sensitive cell line. For that purpose the FGFR2 amplified
gastric cancer cell line Kato-III was used. This cell line
was markedly more sensitive to the highly FGFR specific
compound BGJ398, whereas the sensitivity towards the
more broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258
was similar in MLS and Kato-III cells (Supplemental
Figure S4A).
Effects of FGFR inhibitors on the viability of
myxoid liposarcoma cell lines were further differentiated
using the ApoTox-Glo™ Triplex Assay (Promega).
Inhibitor concentrations reducing the viability of the
cells (1 – 10 µM) were proven to be not cell toxic, but
specifically inducing apoptosis (Figure 4B). BGJ398
and TKI258 already induced apoptosis after 48 hours of
treatment in both cell lines, whereas apoptosis induction
upon treatment with PD173074 in MLS 402 was detected
only after 72 hours (Supplemental Figure S4B).
FGFR inhibition in myxoid liposarcoma cell lines
reduced kinase activity of the receptors, as detected by
reduced receptor phosphorylation (Supplemental Figure
S5A). Furthermore, the downstream signaling was
affected, as shown exemplarily for ERK1/2 (Figure 5A).
All three FGFR inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation
of ERK1/2, being one of the main downstream targets of
FGFRs.
Additionally, the effects of FGFR inhibition on
the migratory activity of MLS 402 and MLS 1765 cells
were examined by scratch assay. The FGFR inhibitors
PD173074, BGJ398 and TKI258 were applied in a final
concentration of 0.1 µM, a concentration which does
not affect cell viability in the regarded timeframe of 24
hours. Supplemental Figure S5B exemplarily shows the
effects of BGJ398 on the migration of MLS 1765 cells.
Scratch closure was examined in FGFR inhibitor treated
and DMSO treated control cells and the migratory activity
was calculated as relative scratch closure compared to
control. All three FGFR inhibitors reduced the migratory
activity of both myxoid liposarcoma cell lines (Figure 5B).
However, PD173074 and BGJ398 showed much stronger
effects than TKI258, which had only little impact on the
migration of MLS 402 cells. In MLS 1765 the effect of
TKI258 on cell migration was indeed more obvious but
still not significant.

trabectedin in a concentration below its single agent
efficacy. The same holds true for the migratory activity of
myxoid liposarcoma cell lines. In MLS 402 as well as in
MLS 1765 cells migration was delayed by the additional
administration of FGFR inhibitors when compared to cells
treated with trabectedin alone (Figure 6C). As seen in the
single agent migration assay, PD173074 and BGJ398
displayed a greater impact on the migration of myxoid
liposarcoma cells than TKI258.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of soft tissue sarcomas in general and
of myxoid liposarcomas in particular is so far restricted
to unspecific chemotherapy and preferably total surgical
resection. The implementation of new specific therapies
requires the identification of suitable targetable molecular
structures. An approach to reveal such target structures is
comparative gene expression profiling as applied in this
study by whole-genome microarray analyses on seven
myxoid liposarcoma samples and an RNA pool of eight
fat tissue samples. That way differential expression of
multiple genes was identified. A principal component
analysis demonstrated a joint clustering of the tumor
samples apart from the control sample. We detected nearly
8,000 genes with a significant fold change of at least ±2.
Compared to other gene expression profiling studies in
sarcomas the number of differentially expressed genes
identified in this study is rather high, but previous studies
mainly compared different sarcoma entities to each other
and did not include whole-genome expression analyses
[11, 12, 14]. Furthermore, the high number of differentially
expressed genes demonstrates the strong homogeneity in
our tumor cohort. This feature of myxoid liposarcomas
became already apparent in previous gene expression and
methylation profiling studies that observed tight clusters
for myxoid liposarcomas clearly distinguishable from
other entities or corresponding normal tissue [12-14].
In order to confirm the reliability of microarray data
by qPCR validation, it is important to determine suitable
references because a universal reference for all kinds of
tissues and experimental conditions does not exist [2427]. Our data revealed that widely used reference genes,
such as GAPDH, are not self-evidently appropriate for
formalin fixed tissue with intense degradation of RNA. We
could identify B2M and IPO8 as suitable reference genes
for myxoid liposarcoma and fat control samples in cryoconserved as well as in formalin-fixed tissue. The herein
presented whole-genome expression analyses could be
reproduced very well by means of qPCR even by using
FFPE tissue and served therefore as method to identify
differentially expressed candidate genes.
Receptor tyrosine kinases belong to the most
promising target structures as their constitutive activation
has been shown in various tumor entities and they can
successfully be targeted [19, 28, 29]. A constitutively

Combination of FGFR inhibitors with trabectedin
Additionally to single agent treatment, FGFR
inhibitors were applied in combination with trabectedin
(ET-743). The corresponding combination scheme is
given in Figure 6A. As shown in Figure 6B for MLS 1765,
the supplementary administration of FGFR inhibitors
enhanced the effects of trabectedin in comparison to single
agent treatment. Cell viability was reduced and apoptosis
was induced by all three inhibitors in combination with

active receptor tyrosine kinase may be due to DNA
mutations or gene amplification but as well overexpression
can lead to permanent receptor signaling [30, 31].
The present study has revealed the receptor tyrosine
kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) as a
gene of interest being highly overexpressed in myxoid
liposarcoma.
FGF receptors were already reported to play a role in
various cancers and their inhibition is effectively applied in
targeted therapies with specific small molecule inhibitors
[32-38]. Even in sarcomas a role of FGF receptors was
described. Girnita et al. showed the importance of the
bFGF pathway for the maintenance of a malignant
phenotype of Ewing’s sarcoma cells [39]. The functional
role and the effective inhibition of FGF receptors in
synovial sarcoma were shown by Ishibe et al. [40]. A
recent study in canine and human sarcomas detected coexpression of various FGFRs and demonstrated growth
inhibitory effects by FGFR inhibition in vitro [41]. An
expression study in different sarcomas by Baird et al.
revealed an association of FGFR2, FGFR4 and FGF18
gene expression with liposarcomas [11]. This association
became also apparent in the present study where we
could detect overexpression not only of FGFR2 but also
of FGFR4 as well as of the ligands FGF5, FGF11 and
FGF18. The parallel overexpression of several FGF/
FGFR family members reinforces a potential role of FGFR
signaling in the pathogenesis of myxoid liposarcoma.
Furthermore, FGFR signaling is described as being
essential in preadipocyte differentiation providing another
possible connection to the pathogenesis of liposarcomas
that are characterized by the presence of premature
adipocytes [42].
In vitro experiments in myxoid liposarcoma cell
lines confirmed a functional role of FGFR signaling.
The administration of specific siRNAs directed against
FGFRs induced apoptosis in MLS 402 and MLS 1765
cells whereby the two cell lines reacted differently to
selective FGFR silencing. While cell survival in MLS
402 cells seems to be dependent on FGFR2, in MLS
1765 rather FGFR1 and FGFR3 are important. Thus, in
myxoid liposarcoma cells there is obviously not a single
FGF receptor acting as a strong tumor driver. Accordingly,
small molecules inhibiting the whole group of FGF
receptors reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis and
delayed migration in both myxoid liposarcoma cell lines.
In the examined myxoid liposarcoma cell lines
the impact of FGFR signaling on survival and migration
seemed to outweigh that on proliferation. FGFR inhibitor
concentrations needed to achieve the observed effects
differed in at least one decimal power. Furthermore, the
FGFR specific inhibitors PD173074 and BGJ398 had a
much greater impact on cell migration than the rather
broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258 also
sustaining the hypothesis that in myxoid liposarcoma
the role of FGFR signaling is especially prominent for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell migration. The herein used FGFR inhibitors TKI258
and BGJ398 are already applied in clinical trials of other
tumor entities, such as FGFR3 mutated bladder cancer or
squamous cell lung cancer with FGFR1 amplification (e.g.
NCT01004224 or NCT01831726). We now demonstrated
FGFR overexpression in myxoid liposarcoma and the
effective application of FGFR inhibition in vitro indicating
a novel targeted therapy approach. This approach might
involve the combination of FGFR inhibitors with
chemotherapeutic agents like trabectedin. In this study
we showed that the additional administration of FGFR
inhibitors can improve the impact on myxoid liposarcoma
cells in comparison to trabectedin alone.
In order to examine whether FGFR inhibitors
alone or in combination with chemotherapy are efficient
as a potent therapy in myxoid liposarcoma, further in
vivo studies are needed. In an in vivo setting also the
role of FGFR signaling in angiogenesis will surely
become relevant. Several FGFs are described to promote
neoangiogenesis, among them FGF2 but also FGF5
and FGF18, for which an overexpression in myxoid
liposarcomas was detected in this study [43-45]. Given
the fact that myxoid liposarcomas are characterized by a
typical branching capillary network, an inhibitor blocking
also angiogenic pathways might be particularly effective
in this entity.
In conclusion, our study revealed overexpression of
FGFR2 as well as a functional role of FGFR signaling
in myxoid liposarcoma and provides basis for the use of
FGFR inhibitors as a novel targeted treatment approach
for these tumors. Further in vivo studies are warranted to
affirm the efficacy of FGFR inhibition either alone or in
combination with chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissue samples
A cohort of 16 human primary myxoid liposarcomas
and 15 fat tissue samples was assorted (Table 1). Tumor
samples were provided by the Biobank of the Center for
Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne Bonn and by the
Institute of Pathology in Heidelberg. Fat tissue samples
were obtained during intra-operative diagnostics in the
scope of the CIO Cologne Bonn. Cryo-conserved material
of eight fat tissue samples was additionally post-fixed
in formalin and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) to obtain
suitable controls for FFPE tumor samples. The study was
approved by the ethics committees of the medical schools
of the universities Bonn and Cologne. All cases were
histologically characterized by an experienced pathologist
(HUS, GM, EW or RB) and DDIT3-translocation was
proven with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. FISH probes for DDIT3,

FUS and EWS1R were from Abbott Molecular (Abbott
Park IL, U.S.A.). Primer sequences for RT-PCR reactions
are given in Supplemental Table S1.

knock-down in MLS cell lines after siRNA transfection
TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays for FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4
as well as the reference genes IPO8 and B2M were used
along with the TaqMan® Universal Master Mix II (all from
Life Technologies).

RNA extraction, quality control and cDNA
synthesis

FGFR2 expression in tissue samples

Total RNA extraction was performed with
miRNeasy mini or miRNeasy FFPE Kit (both Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). RNA was quantified using Nanodrop
1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham
MA, U.S.A.). Assessment of RNA degradation was
performed via Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000
Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA,
U.S.A.). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer
primers and Omniscript Reverse Transcription Kit
(Qiagen). Two independent cDNA syntheses were pooled
for each sample. In order to detect FGFR knock-down
after transfection of specific siRNAs the High-Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA™ Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA,
U.S.A.) was used for cDNA synthesis.

Gene expression of FGFR2 in primary tumor
samples was detected by qPCR with Power SYBR®
Green PCR Kit (Life Technologies) and specific primers
(for 5’‑GTGAAACTTGGTACTTCATGGTGA, rev
5’‑GAGATGGCATTCTTGTTGTTACTG). Expression
data were normalized using IPO8 and B2M as reference
genes and relative gene expression was calculated with
REST. Immunohistochemistry for FGFR2 was performed
using rabbit anti-FGFR2 antibody from Zytomed Systems
(Berlin, Germany). FGFR2 protein expression in primary
tumor and fat tissue samples was analyzed with western
blot using rabbit anti-FGFR2 antibody from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis MO, U.S.A.) in a dilution of 1:500. For
detection of reference protein expression rabbit anti-HPRT
antibody from abcam (Cambridge, GB) in a dilution of
1:1000 was used.

Microarray analyses
RNA from seven tumor samples and an RNA pool
of eight fat tissue samples with a minimal RIN value of
7.0 were selected for whole-genome microarray analyses
with Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays
4x44K. Microarray analyses were carried out by the
genomic service of Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). Raw data of microarray hybridizations have
been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [46]
and are accessible through GEO Series accession number
GSE62747 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?acc=GSE62747).

Cell culture and FGFR inhibition in vitro
Myxoid liposarcoma cell lines MLS 402 and MLS
1765 were provided by Prof. Pierre Åman, University of
Gothenburg, Sweden and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 2% or 10%
FBS under humidified conditions with 5% CO2. Cell lines’
entity was verified by proof of the specific FUS-DDIT3
translocation. Furthermore, uniqueness of the cell lines
was confirmed by STR profiling performed at DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany. Gastric cancer cell line KatoIII was purchased from Cell Lines Service (Eppelheim,
Germany) and cultured in F12 medium supplemented
with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS under humidified
conditions with 5% CO2. FGFR2 amplification in KatoIII cells was proven with FISH analysis using Zytolight
SPEC FGFR2/CEN 10 Dual Color Probe from ZytoVision
(Bremerhaven, Germany).
FGFR inhibitors PD173074 (purchased from Sigma
Aldrich), BGJ398 and TKI258 (both provided by Novartis,
Basel, Switzerland) as well as trabectedin (provided by
PharmaMar, Madrid, Spain) were solved and prediluted
in DMSO. Final DMSO concentration during assays was
0.1% for single agent or 0.2% for combined treatment.
For FGFR silencing cells were transiently transfected
with 100 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMax
(Life Technologies) and Stealth RNAi™ siRNAs against
FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 (set of 3 siRNAs each) as well as
Stealth RNAi™ Negative Control Duplexes (all from Life
Technologies). AllStars Hs Cell Death siRNA (Qiagen)

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
qPCR reactions were performed using Applied
Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life
Technologies) or LightCycler® 480 II system (Roche
Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Expression stability
of 16 potential reference genes was analyzed with
TaqMan® Array Human Endogenous Control Panels (Life
Technologies). Obtained raw Cq (cycle of quantification)
values were converted into relative quantities and analyzed
using GeNorm [47] and NormFinder (MDL, Aarhus,
Denmark). Expression of candidate genes was analyzed
using Power SYBR® Green PCR Kit (Life Technologies).
Corresponding primer pairs are given in Supplemental
Table S2. Gene expression data were analyzed using
the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) [48] and
graphically visualized using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla CA, U.S.A.). In order to detect FGFR

Scratch assay
Cells were grown to 100% confluence in medium
containing 10% FBS in 24 well culture plates. In each well
a scratch was set crosswise with a 100 µl pipet tip, debris
was washed away using PBS. Cells were incubated for
24 h with medium containing 2% FBS and the respective
treatment. Pictures of each well with centered scratch were
taken before and after treatment period and uncovered
areas were determined using AxioVision 4.8 software
(Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Scratch closure
was calculated as the proportion of previously uncovered
area closed by cell migration after the considered period.
Migratory activity was defined as relative scratch closure
compared to control.
