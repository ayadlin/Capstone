ABSTRACT
Autophagy defect has been shown to be correlated with malignant phenotype and
poor prognosis of human cancers, however, the detailed mechanisms remain obscure.
In this study, we investigated the biological changes induced by autophagy inhibition
in gastric cancer. We showed that inhibition of autophagy in gastric cancer cells
promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, alters metabolic
phenotype from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis
and converts cell phenotype toward malignant, which maybe further contribute to
chemoresistance and poor prognosis of gastric cancer. We also identified that the
EMT and metabolism alterations induced by autophagy inhibition were dependent on
ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α pathway. More importantly, scavenging of ROS by the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated activation of NF-κB and HIF-1α in autophagydeficient gastric cancer cells, and autophagy inhibition induced metastasis and
glycolysis were also diminished by NAC in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggested
that autophagy defect promotes metastasis and glycolysis of gastric cancer, and
antioxidants could be used to improve disease outcome for gastric cancer patients
with autophagy defect.

intracellular damaged proteins and organelles and converts
them to metabolic intermediates in the autolysosomes for
energy generation and biosynthesis [6, 7]. Autophagy can
support tumor cells survival through generating substrates
for mitochondrial metabolism, preventing metabolic
stress, mitigating accumulation of toxic substances and
so on [7, 8]. On the other hand, defective autophagy is
involved in the onset and progression of tumors via
inducing inflammation and necrosis [9–11]. Thus, the
role of autophagy in tumors is complicated and further
investigation is needed to elucidate the character of
autophagy.
The expression of BECN1, an important autophagy
initiator, is suppressed in several human tumors, such
as ovarian, breast and prostate cancers [12]. Recently,

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is the second deadliest disease among
cancers worldwide and the incidence rate is highest in
Eastern Asia [1–3]. Although therapeutic strategies are
continually improved, overall 5-year survival is still
less than 30% [4]. Thus, it’s urgent to explore for more
effective treatment options. Due to the heterogeneity of
gastric cancer, there are individual differences in tumor
aggressiveness, histopathologic features, and treatment
response [5]. Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers
may facilitate the selection of patients to provide
individualized therapy.

BECN1 has been reported to be positively correlated
with tumor differentiation in several cancers, and can be
used as an independent biomarker for predicting overall
survival and progression-free survival in gastric and liver
cancer patients [12–15]. These studies have illustrated
that autophagy defect may be associated with malignant
phenotype and poor prognosis of human cancers, however,
the specific mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we
gained further insights into the role of autophagy in gastric
cancer progression. Our results indicated that autophagy
provides metabolic intermediates for mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation to fuel cell survival, while
autophagy defect causes the shift from oxidative
phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis for proper energy
homeostasis in gastric cancer cells. Besides, we also found
that autophagy defect induces other biological changes,
including promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), metastasis and malignant transformation.
Importantly, ROS generation is involved in the autophagy
defect induced biological changes, and scavenging of ROS
by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could revert
these biological changes in gastric cancer cells.

EMT induced by autophagy inhibition was dependent on
HIF-1α activation, SGC-shBECN1 cells were treated with
1 μM and 5 μM 2-MeOE2 (a specific inhibitor of HIF1α) for 48 h. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, the HIF1α nuclear translocation and EMT induced by autophagy
inhibition were reverted by 2-MeOE2. These results were
further verified by HIF-1α siRNA in SGC-shBECN1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2B & S2C). Altogether, these
experiments demonstrated that compromised autophagy
could enhance the EMT phenotype of gastric cancer cells
and this process could be HIF-1α-dependent.

Autophagy defect increases HIF-1α expression
by ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α pathway in gastric
cancer cells
Previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy
defect results in an increase in intracellular ROS level as
well as mitochondrial ROS level [16, 17]. Consistent with
these studies, our results showed that both intracellular
and mitochondrial ROS levels were increased in SGCshBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1 cells compared with control
cells (Figure 3A–3C & Supplementary Figure S3A). Then,
we tested whether activation of HIF-1α was associated
with increased ROS in autophagy deficient cells. After
incubating SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1 cells with
3 mM and 10 mM NAC (ROS scavenging agent) for 48 h,
the HIF-1α accumulation was down-regulated and the EMT
was reverted (Figure 3D & Supplementary Figure S3B),
suggested that autophagy defect induced HIF-1α activation
and EMT are based on ROS generation.
We also found that loss of autophagy in gastric
cancer cells led to phosphorylation and degradation of
IκBα, facilitated nuclear translocation of NF-κB, moreover,
these changes were suppressed by NAC (Figure 3E &
Supplementary Figure S3B). According to previous report
[18], these results suggested that increased ROS caused by
autophagy inhibition activates NF-κB through the classical
IKK-dependent pathway. Afterwards, we tested whether
NF-κB activation was involved in the ROS-induced
accumulation of HIF-1α. After treating SGC-shBECN1 cells
with 5 μM BAY 11–7082 (a NF-κB inhibitor via restraining
phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα) for 24 h, the
induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and overexpression
of HIF-1α were attenuated (Figure 3F). Similarly, the HIF-1α
upregulation was inhibited by NF-κB p65 siRNA in SGCshBECN1 cells (Supplementary Figure S3C & S3D). Since
HIF-1α gene has been reported as a transcriptional target
of NF-κB [19, 20], we performed EMSA to evaluate the
autophagy defect mediated transcriptional activity of NFκB in gastric cancer cells using nuclear extracts and specific
probe (containing NF-κB binding site in HIF-1α promoter).
The protein-probe binding was more intensive with the
loading protein derived from SGC-shBECN1 cells than
control cells, and NAC could abrogate the NF-κB-probe

RESULTS
Autophagy inhibition promotes EMT of gastric
cancer cells through HIF-1α activation
The expression of BECN1 was evaluated in four
human gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, HGC-27, MGC803 and SGC-7901). As shown in Figure 1A, BECN1
expression was higher in SGC-7901 cells (moderately
differentiated cells) than that in AGS cells (poorly
differentiated cells), MGC-803 cells (poorly differentiated
cells) and HGC-27 cells (undifferentiated cells). SGC7901 and MGC-803 cells with stable autophagy inhibition
(SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1 cells) were
generated through knockdown of BECN1 by lentiviral
transduction (Figure 1B–1D). Except EpCAM, autophagy
inhibition increased the expression of mesenchymal
markers such as N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Twist-1 in
SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells (Figure 1E). In contrast,
the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, was
suppressed in SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1 cells
compared with control cells (Figure 1E). Consistent with
these results, the morphology of SGC-7901 and MGC803 cells became more spindle-like and scattered after
autophagy inhibition (Supplementary Figure S1).
Furthermore, we found that autophagy defect
promoted intracellular accumulation and nuclear
localization of HIF-1α in SGC-7901 and MGC-803
cells under normoxic circumstance (Figure 2A & 2C
left; Supplementary Figure S3B). Nevertheless, the HIF2α expression was not affected by autophagy inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S2A). To investigate whether

results indicated that increased expression of HIF-1α induced
by autophagy defect is based at least in part on ROS-NF-κBHIF-1α pathway.

by 2-MeOE2 or NAC. Correspondingly, the glucose
uptake level of SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1
cells was increased significantly compared with control
cells (Figure 4C), meanwhile, the lactate secretion level
of these cells was also increased (Figure 4D), implying
that autophagy defect induces aerobic glycolysis in
gastric cancer cells. On the other hand, the concentrations
of citrate and fumarate, two intermediates in the TCA
cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) used to form ATP, were
decreased in SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1 cells
(Figure 4E & 4F), indicating that autophagy defect reduces
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation level in gastric
cancer cells. However, there was no significant difference
of ATP production between autophagy deficient cells and
control cells (Figure 4G & 4H). To investigate whether

Autophagy inhibition alters metabolic phenotype

Because HIF-1α is a key regulator of cell
metabolism [21], we tested whether autophagy inhibition
could influence cell’ metabolism. As shown in Figure

of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and promoted
membrane translocation of GLUT-1 in gastric cancer
cells, the enhanced GLUT-1 expression could be reverted

more significant in SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1
cells than control cells (Figure 4G & 4H), indicating that
autophagy deficient cells are more relied on glycolysis

autophagy deficient cells. Besides, the EMT couldn’t be
reverted by 2-DG in SGC-shBECN1 and MGC-shBECN1
cells (Supplementary Figure S4), demonstrating  that
autophagy inhibition induced glycolysis has no appreciable
effect on EMT. Altogether, these results suggested that
autophagy defect causes the shift from oxidative phos­
phorylation to glycolysis in gastric cancer cells for
maintaining proper energy homeostasis.

proliferation of SGC-shBECN1 cells was similar to
parental cells (Figure 5A left). Even though the growth of
all cells was suppressed under serum-free condition, SGCshBECN1 cells grew significantly faster than control cells

acquired the ability of serum-independent growth partially.

colonies number of SGC-shBECN1 cells was higher and
the sizes of these colonies were larger than control cells.
Since serum-independent proliferation and anchorageindependent growth are positively correlated with the
degree of tumor malignancy, these data indicated that loss
of autophagy enhances malignant transformation of gastric
cancer cells.

showed that expression of HIF-1α and GLUT-1 were upregulated in SGC-shBECN1 group compared to SGCshCONTROL group, and the expression of E-cadherin
was just the opposite (Figure 6B). Based on these results,
we examined whether autophagy defect could promote
metastasis of gastric cancer cells firstly. Liver metastatic

SGC-shCONTROL and SGC-shBECN1 cells, and six
mice (6/8) in SGC-shBECN1 group formed visible

DISCUSSION

energy metabolism of gastric cancer cells was examined
in this study. We discovered that inhibition of autophagy
in gastric cancer cells reduced the production of citrate
and fumarate, promoted the expression and membrane
translocation of GLUT-1 as a result of the increased
HIF-1α expression, consequently enhanced the glucose
uptake and lactate production. Thus, our results indicated

In the 1920s, Otto Warburg put forward the claim
that the energy supply of cancer cells mainly rely on
aerobic glycolysis, which is in contrast to normal cells
[22]. Because autophagy can provide TCA metabolites and
contribute to ATP generation [7], the role of autophagy in

a

that autophagy defect induces the metabolic alteration
from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is in
agreement with previous study [17].
Besides the up-regulation of HIF-1α expression,
we also found that autophagy defect could cause an
increase in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS levels
in gastric cancer cells, which is consistent with previous
studies [16, 17]. Recently, many studies reported that
HIF-1α accumulation could be regulated by ROS through
enhancing transcription of HIF-1α gene and stabilization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of HIF-1α protein [23–26]. Indeed, our results showed that
HIF-1α accumulation induced by autophagy defect was
markedly attenuated by antioxidant NAC. Furthermore, we
found that autophagy inhibition facilitated the degradation
of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and these
processes were reverted by NAC, which is in according
with previous report that NF-κB can be activated by ROS
through IKK-dependent pathway [18]. Early studies have
illustrated that NF-κB is a direct modulator of HIF-1α
expression through binding the HIF-1α promoter and

initiating the transcription of HIF-1α gene [19, 20]. This
is also confirmed in the present study, suggesting that
autophagy defect induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB
increases HIF-1α mRNA and protein levels in gastric
cancer cells. In addition, increased HIF-1α expression
can enhance glycolysis via promoting the transcription
of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes [21, 27].
Therefore, our results indicated that metabolic alteration
of gastric cancer cells induced by autophagy defect could
be dependent, at least in part, on ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α
pathway. What’s more, immunohistochemical and PET
analysis showed that NAC could suppress autophagy
defect induced up-regulation of HIF-1α and GLUT-1,
as well as glucose uptake in gastric cancer xenografts
(Figure 6B & 7), which is further sustaining our
hypothesis. However, the relationship between autophagy
and cell metabolism is still complex and more studies are
needed to elucidate the issue.
Recently, ROS have been verified to be capable
of regulating many intracellular signal transduction
pathways, and abnormal ROS signal may stimulate
carcinogenesis of different cancer cells [23]. Yang et al.
have already demonstrated that autophagy defect causes
a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and an increase
in ROS level in mitochondrion [17], the similar results
were also obtained by us, which seems paradoxical to the
fact that mitochondrial ROS production is mainly depend
on mitochondrial oxygen metabolism [28, 29]. On the
other hand, mitochondrial ROS level could be increased
significantly when mitochondrion makes ATP at low level
[30], and our results are more likely to support this claim,
which may partly explain the mechanism of increased
mitochondrial ROS production induced by autophagy
inhibition. Currently, the specific mechanism is still
unclear and needs more research.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

This study also displayed that autophagy defect
could induce EMT of gastric cancer cells through
up-regulation of HIF-1α expression, in agreement
with previous study that EMT regulators are located
downstream of HIF-1α [26]. Also, autophagy inhibition
promoted hepatic metastasis after splenic implantation of
gastric cancer cells in mice. Moreover, the induced EMT
and metastasis were suppressed by NAC, which reaffirms
the fact that ROS can be involved in tumor metastasis
[23, 26]. In summary, our data indicated that autophagy
defect also promotes EMT and metastasis of gastric cancer
cells via ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α pathway. Meanwhile, it
has been described that autophagy deficiency facilitates
EMT of breast cancer cells and embryonic fibroblast
cells through inhibiting the degradation of mesenchymal
markers such as Snail and Twist-1 [31–34]. Therefore,
we concluded that autophagy defect can induce EMT not
only through suppressing the degradation of mesenchymal
markers but also through increasing the expression of
mesenchymal markers via ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α pathway.
However, several studies showed that EMT can be
induced by autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells and
HK-2 cells [35, 36]. Even though the contradictory results
aren’t explained in this study, we speculate that the role
of autophagy in EMT may vary with different cell types.
Inactivation of autophagy has been shown to correlate
with the malignant phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma
[14]. Likewise, we found that autophagy defect facilitated
malignant transformation of gastric cancer cells. Consistent
with early study [12], our results also demonstrated that
autophagy was inhibited in poorly differentiated gastric
cancer cells and tissues. Thus, autophagy may decide the
differentiation and progression of gastric cancer. However,
we didn’t find the significant relationship between
autophagy defect and growth of gastric cancer cells, it

might be due to, although autophagy inhibition can increase
HIF-1α expression, HIF-1α has no effect on proliferation
and viability of gastric cancer cells [37].
The clinical data and specimens from 156 gastric
cancer patients were used in this study. In line with
previous research [12], our study showed that low
expression of BECN1, an essential autophagy initiator,
was associated with advanced clinical stage of gastric
cancer patients. And negative expression of BECN1
could be an independent prognostic marker for predicting
shorter overall survival and progression-free survival
in gastric cancer patients [12, 13]. Moreover, our
immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that BECN1
expression was negatively correlated with HIF-1α and
GLUT-1 expression, and positively correlated with
E-cadherin expression in human gastric cancer tissues,
which indicated that autophagy defect promotes glycolysis
and metastasis of gastric cancer in patients. Thus, loss
of autophagy may cause the worse prognosis of gastric
cancer patients by accelerating the development and
progression of this disease. However, how to improve
the outcome of these patients still remains a puzzle. The
present study suggested that autophagy inhibition induced
biological changes, such as metastasis and glycolysis, are
ROS dependent in gastric cancer cells, which may be used
to provide a novel therapeutic strategy to gastric cancer
patients with compromised autophagy. In fact, we found
that these biological changes could be reverted effectively
by antioxidant NAC via blocking the ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α
pathway. Besides, the inhibitory effect of NAC on these
biological changes may also rely on the suppression of
mTOR-signaling pathway [38–40] and this issue should be
verified by further investigation. Therefore, antioxidants
may be valuable for better treatment to gastric cancer
patients with autophagy defect.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that
autophagy inhibition promotes glycolysis and metastasis
of gastric cancer cells, and these biological changes can
be reverted by antioxidant NAC. Therefore, identifying
gastric cancer subtypes which autophagic genes are downregulated may facilitate the selection of patients that will
respond sensitively to antioxidants.

confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

respectively following the methods provided by the
manufacturer. Briefly, conditioned mediums and cell
lysates were moved into upper filter devices of Amicon
Ultra-0.5 10KDa spin filters (Millipore, MA, USA) and
centrifuged for 20 min at 8,000g to be deproteinized, then
the solutions in the lower centrifuge tubes were used as
the samples for analysis immediately. The fresh samples
filtrated from conditioned mediums were used for glucose
and lactate assay, and samples from cell lysates were used
for intracellular citrate, fumarate and ATP measurement
by corresponding kits. The amounts of glucose uptake and
lactate secretion were calculated using the concentration
difference value between conditioned mediums and fresh
mediums. Metabolites levels were normalized by total
protein concentration of cells.

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
measurement
Intracellular ROS measurement was performed
according to procedures described previously [42]. After
treatment with 10 μM DCF-DA (ROS-specific fluorescent
probe, Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C, cells were resuspended
in ice-cold PBS for flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, or
cells stained with DAPI were observed by a confocal
microscope. DCF-DA was excited at 488 nm and emitted
light was measured at 530 nm (Ex488 nm/Em530 nm).

Mitochondrial ROS measurement

Cell proliferation assay

Mitochondrial ROS was measured using MitoSOX
Red (mitochondrial ROS-specific fluorescent probe, Ex510 nm/
Em580 nm, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
[43]. After incubation with 5 μM MitoSOX Red for 30 min at
37°C, cells were resuspended and fluorescence intensity was
measured by FCM. For fluorescence microscopy analysis,
cells were incubated with 5 μM MitoSOX Red and 100 nM
MitoTracker Green (label mitochondria, Ex490 nm/Em516 nm,
Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C.

Cells grew in 96-well plate were incubated with
MTT (Sigma) for 4 h, then the supernatant was removed
and DMSO was added to each well. After shaking the
plate for 10 min, the optical density value was measured
by an ELISA reader (BIO-Tek ELx800, Winooski, VT,
USA) at 570 nm.

Anchorage-independent growth assay
Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by soft
agar assay and the assay was done in 6-well plates [27].
1.5 mL complete medium containing 0.6% agar per well
was solidified to form bottom layer, then 1.5 mL complete
medium containing 0.3% agar and 5 × 103 cells was added
on the top of bottom layer. After 10 days’ incubation at
37°C, the colonies consisted of > 10 cells were counted.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
The EMSA probe of NF-κB binding site in the HIF1α promoter (5′-GCGTGGGCTGGGGTGGGGACTTG
CCGCCTGCGTCGC-3′) [19] was synthesized by Viagene
Biotech Inc. (Jiangsu, China) and EMSA was performed
using EMSA kit (Viagene) following the manufacturer’s
instruction [44]. Equal micrograms of nuclear proteins
were mixed with the biotin-labeled NF-κB probe and
poly dI:dC for 20 min at room temperature for binding
reaction. Afterwards, the DNA − protein complexes were
electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel at 180 V
for 70 min and transferred to a binding membrane. The
transferred DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by
ultra violet for 10 min and incubated with streptavidin
conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 20 min. Reactive
bands were detected by chemiluminescence reaction. NFκB positive control was used to locate the NF-κB-probe
binding band.

Animals study
5 weeks old male athymic nude mice were
purchased from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University
(Zhejiang, China). 6 × 106 SGC-shCONTROL or
SGC-shBECN1 cells collected in 200 μL PBS were
subcutaneously injected into the back of every mouse.
Once visible tumor masses established, mice in
SGC-shBECN1 group were divided into two groups
randomly to receive intraperitoneal injections of 0.9%
NaCl or NAC (50 mg/kg) respectively thrice per week
for 4 weeks. Tumor masses of all mice were measured
twice a week and tumor volume was calculated using
the formula: volume = (length × width2)/2. The mice
were sacrificed when tumor volume approximately
reached 200 mm3, then subcutaneous xenografts were
harvested, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin. Immunohistological staining for BECN1, HIF1α, E-cadherin, GLUT-1 were performed according to
the procedures described earlier [41]. Liver metastatic
mice models were induced by splenic injection [45].

Metabolism study
Levels of glucose, lactate, citrate, fumarate and
ATP were measured using Glucose Colorimetric/
Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA,
USA), Lactate Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit
(BioVision), Citrate Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay
Kit, Fumarate Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision) and
ATP Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision)

Briefly, 5 × 105 cells in 50 μL PBS were subcapsularly
inoculated into spleen of each mouse. 6 weeks later,
livers were excised and observed by visual inspection.
When metastatic nodules in livers were discernible, the
corresponding mice were regarded as liver metastatic
models. All animal experiments were approved by
the Animal Experimentation Committee of Zhejiang
University.

representative gastric cancer tissue and adjacent normal
mucosa tissue of each case, and transferred to the recipient
paraffin block at defined array positions. The consecutive
TMA slices were used for immunohistochemical study.

Immunohistochemical analysis and evaluation
Protein expression of BECN1, HIF-1α, E-cadherin,
GLUT-1 in consecutive TMA sections were detected by
immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining
was evaluated and scored by two independent observers.
The staining intensity of tumor cells in the whole cylinder
was classified into 4 parts: negative (score 0), weak
(score 1), moderate (score 2) and strong (score 3). The
percentage of positive staining tumor cells was scored
as follows: 0 (negative), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%) and 3
(51–100%). The protein expression of every cylinder was
assessed by using the sum of staining intensity score and
percentage score. Next, all combining immunoreactive
scores were divided into two groups: 0–3 (low protein
expression group) and 4–6 (high protein expression
group).

Detection of glucose uptake in subcutaneous
xenograft by positron emission tomography
(PET)
Fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG,
an analog of glucose) was synthesized using an automatic
18
F-FDG synthesizer (FDG-F100, Sumitomo Heavy
Industries, Tokyo, Japan) in the Department of Nuclear
Medicine, second affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University.
After fasting for 6 h, every mouse were injected with 200
μCi 18F-FDG through tail vein. 40 min later, mice were
anesthetized and placed at the center of a microPET
scanner (R4, Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN,
USA). Subsequently, A 10-min microPET data collection
was performed. The images were reconstructed by ordered
subsets expectation maximization calculating algorithm.
18
F-FDG uptake in xenograft was calculated for the
semiquantitative analysis using the formula: T/N (tumorto-nontumor) ratio = pixel maximum uptake (percentage
of injection dose) in tumor / pixel mean uptake (percentage
of injection dose) in upper limb muscles.

Statistical analysis
Values are shown as means ± SEM. Student’s
t-test was performed for analyzing the comparisons of
quantitative data between two groups. Chi-square or
Fisher’s exact tests were used to evaluate categorical
data. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
