Abstract
Malignant ascites is a common complication in the late stages of
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) that greatly diminishes the quality
of life of patients. Malignant ascites is a known consequence of
vascular dysfunction, but current approved treatments are not
effective in preventing ﬂuid accumulation. In this study, we investigated an alternative strategy of targeting macrophage functions to
reverse the vascular pathology of malignant ascites using ﬂuid from
human patients and an immunocompetent murine model (ID8)
of EOC that mirrors human disease by developing progressive
vascular disorganization and leakiness culminating in massive
ascites. We demonstrate that the macrophage content in ascites
ﬂuid from human patients and the ID8 model directly correlates

with vascular permeability. To further substantiate macrophages'
role in the pathogenesis of malignant ascites, we blocked macrophage function in ID8 mice using a colony-stimulating factor 1
receptor kinase inhibitor (GW2580). Administration of GW2580
in the late stages of disease resulted in reduced inﬁltration of
protumorigenic (M2) macrophages and dramatically decreased
ascites volume. Moreover, the disorganized peritoneal vasculature
became normalized and sera from GW2580-treated ascites protected against endothelial permeability. Therefore, our ﬁndings
suggest that macrophage-targeted treatment may be a promising
strategy toward a safe and effective means to control malignant
ascites of EOC. Cancer Res; 75(22); 4742–52. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

nosis or is merely indicative of the advanced stage of progression
for patients with EOC, this complication clearly compromises
their quality of life (2). Current treatment methods, such as
paracentesis and peritovenous shunts, physically drain the accumulated ascites ﬂuid but do not address the root cause of this
complication. Hence, the ascites ﬂuid reaccumulates after the
procedure. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant risk of side effects due to
infection or ﬂuid and electrolyte imbalance are associated with
physical drainage of malignant ascites (1, 2).
In the pursuit of new, effective pharmaceutical remedies to
manage ascites of EOC, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) emerged as an excellent target for several reasons
(3, 4). VEGF, also known as vascular permeability factor, was
originally isolated from ascites ﬂuid (5). VEGF is markedly
elevated in the ascites ﬂuid of ovarian cancer patients and
increased VEGF expression is a poor prognostic marker for EOC
(6–10). In xenograft mouse EOC models, anti-VEGF treatments
effectively suppressed tumor growth and reduce ascites formation (11, 12). Corroborating these preclinical ﬁndings are two
recent phase II clinical trials showing that treatment with VEGF
trap Aﬂibercept signiﬁcantly reduces ascites buildup in patients
with advanced ovarian cancer (13, 14). However, the enthusiasm for this VEGF blockade treatment is dampened by significant treatment-related adverse vascular events, such as hypertension, venous thrombosis, and congestive heart failure. The
most concerning of the adverse events is fatal intestinal perforation, which affected 10% of Aﬂibercept-treated patients in the
randomized, controlled study (14). Therapies with anti-VEGF

Malignant ascites is a common side effect of epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC), characterized by the accumulation of ﬂuid in the
abdomen (1). It has been estimated that approximately 70% of
patients with EOC will develop ascites, particularly in the disseminated or recurrence stage of the disease. Although it is
debated whether malignant ascites contributes to a poor prog-

Targeting CSF1R to Block TAMs Eases EOC Malignant Ascites

antibody, bevacizumab, also have similar severe side effects
(15). These life-threatening side effects of VEGF-targeted therapies raise signiﬁcant concerns of their use without clear longterm survival beneﬁts. The search for safe and effective treatments to manage malignant ascites of EOC continues.
Another tumor microenvironment component that has
received great attention in recent years is the inﬁltrating myeloid
cells, such as macrophages (16). A large volume of evidence
supports that once recruited to and "educated" by the tumor,
these macrophages promote cancer progression (17) by various
mechanisms such as heightening the immunosuppressive conditions, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling, which in turn leads to
enhanced tumor growth and metastasis (16, 17). The tumorpromoting tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are commonly
designated as "M2" in contrast to the classical-activated inﬂammatory "M1" macrophages (16, 17). In EOC, a large inﬁltrating
population of macrophages has been observed within tumor
nodules and in the ascites ﬂuid (18, 19). However, their phenotypes and functions have not been well studied. A distinctive
feature of many human EOC tumors is that they secrete copious
amounts of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1). CSF-1, also
known as M-CSF, is a critical cytokine that regulates the differentiation, growth, and function of macrophages by binding to
and activating its cognate receptor CSF1R (c-fms) present on
monocytes and macrophages (20). CSF-1 is also known to play
a role in educating macrophages into M2 macrophages (21, 22).
Not only is CSF-1 known to be elevated in patient ascites, but an
elevated level of this cytokine is associated with poor prognosis
(23, 24). These ﬁndings suggest that the CSF-1/CSF1R axis might
promote oncogenic effects on tumor cells directly or modulate
tumorigenesis through the recruitment and function of TAMs
found in EOC tumors, or both.
In this study, we characterized the progression of the murine
ID8 EOC model with special attention paid to the evolution of
TAMs in this context. Mirroring the characteristics of human EOC,
the ID8 tumor-bearing mice developed massive malignant ascites
in the late stages. We observed a great expansion in macrophages
within the ascites that correlated with vascular dysregulation. To
demonstrate a causative role of TAMs in the vascular pathology of
malignant ascites, we used a selective CSF1R kinase inhibitor,
GW2580, to block macrophage function. GW2580 lowered "M2"
TAMs and also dramatically reduced ascites ﬂuid accumulation.
Findings from this study support the notion that TAMs are key
players in causing or perpetuating the vascular leakiness of EOC
ascites.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, lentiviral cell marking, and RT-PCR
All cell lines were cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2 in DMEM with
100 U/mL penicillin and speciﬁc media components for each cell
line as follows. Murine ID8 EOC cells (kind gift from Dr. Oliver
Dorigo, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) require 4% FBS and
1% insulin–transferrin–selenium (ITS, Gibco 100 solution).
Immortomice-derived endothelial cells (IMEC) from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (EC) required 10% FBS and 20 U/mL
interferon-gamma (IFNg), whereas OVCAR3 cells required 20%
FBS and SVEC4-10 cells required 10% FBS. Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) required MCDB-131 medium (VEC
Technologies) with 10% FBS. Cell lines were PCR tested for the
absence of mycoplasma contamination.

Renilla luciferase lentiviral vector was propagated as previously
described (25). ID8 cells were transduced at multiplicity of
infection 2, which resulted in 97% GFPþ transduction.
In vivo tumor models and bioluminescent imaging
All animal experiments were approved by the UCLA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to
national animal care guidelines, ethics, and regulations. For
the intraperitoneal model: Renilla luciferase-marked ID8 cells
(10  106) in 500 mL PBS were injected intraperitoneally into
C57BL/6 female mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME).
GW2580 (LC Labs) treatment (160 mg/kg) or control diluent
(0.1% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose; Sigma-Aldrich; 0.1%
Tween20 in distilled H2O) was given daily starting 10 to 12 weeks
after tumor injection.
For the OVCAR3 model, cells were initially grown subcutaneously in female nude mice (Jackson Laboratories) to obtain
enough tumor cells. Tumors were harvested and cells disassociated,
and 2.5  106 cells were injected intraperitoneally into female
nude mice. Animals develop signs of late-stage EOC after 3 months,
and GW2580 treatment or diluent was given as described above.
Renilla-marked ID8 tumor-bearing mice were imaged using the
IVIS Lumina II as previously described (25), and bioluminescent
signals were analyzed using Living Image 4.0 software.
Perfusion assay and whole mount immunohistochemistry
Mice were injected intravenous with 60 mg biotinylated lectin
(Vector) and 60 mg streptavidin Cy3 (Invitrogen). After 5 minutes,
mice were anesthetized and perfused with 20 mL of PBS and
20 mL of 3% paraformaldehyde injected into the left ventricle.
Tissues were ﬁxed with 2% PFA for 5 to 6 hours, then washed
with PBS overnight at 4 C. Mesentery was fragmented into 0.2 to
0.5 cm and blocked in PBST (0.05% Tween20 in PBS) with 3%
donkey serum for 30 minutes. Samples were then incubated with
primary antibodies for 1 hour and washed with PBST, followed by
secondary antibodies (1:200) for 1 hour. Antibodies used are
antimouse CD31 (1:50; BD Biosciences), antimouse isolectin
(1:75; Invitrogen), antimouse CD11b (1:50; BD Biosciences),
and antimouse CD206 (1:50; BD Biosciences).
Miles assay
One microgram of Evans Blue in 100 mL sterile PBS was
intravenously injected into mice. After 30 minutes, mice were
sacriﬁced and mesentery tissue was removed. Tissue was weighed
and placed in 500 mL formamide for 48 hours at 55 C. The optical
density of the extracted Evans Blue was read at 620 nm (BioTek
Synergy H1 plate reader) and converted to ng/mg tissue.
Flow cytometry
Harvested tumors were minced into fragments and digested
with 80 U/mL collagenase (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 2% FBS
for 1 hour at 37 C, and passed through a 70 mm cell strainer (BD).
Spleens and lymph nodes were gently dissociated between the
rough surfaces of two glass slides. Peripheral blood was obtained
by retro orbital bleed. Ascites was completely drained from the
peritoneum with a syringe. After red blood cell lysis (SigmaAldrich), single-cell suspensions were ﬁltered and incubated for
30 minutes on ice with the following: APC-CD45, e450-CD11b,
PerCP-Cy5.5-Gr-1, PE-Cy7-F4/80, a700-MHCII, PE-CD4, e450CD8, and FITC-CCR2 (eBioscience, 1:500). Intracellular staining
was performed for PE-Cy7-IFNg and PE-IL12. Samples were run on

the BD LSR-II ﬂow cytometer (BD). Data were analyzed with
FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Processing of patient samples
Patient materials were collected under a UCLA Gyn-Onc Tissue
Bank protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board. All
patients' identiﬁcation was blinded in this study. Fifty milliliters
of freshly harvested ascites ﬂuid were spun down at 1500 rpm and
sera were frozen immediately at 80 C. Ascites cells were subjected to red blood cell lysis, ﬁltered, and incubated for 30 minutes
in ice with the following ﬂow cytometry antibodies: PE-Cy7CD33, PE-CD68, APC-HLA-DR, FITC-CD4, APC-e780-CD8a
(eBioscience, 1:500), PerCP e710-CD206, Alexa Fluor 488Muc-1 (eBioscience, 1:200). Cells were ﬁxed for 15 minutes in
3% PFA at RT and run on the BD LSR-II ﬂow cytometer (BD). Data
were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
In vitro permeability assays
Liver sinusoidal ECs from IMEC and HUVECs were plated on
stabilized 8W10Eþ PET Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) Cultureware Disposable Electrode Arrays (Applied
Biophysics). Three hundred microliters of murine serum was
added to each well-containing conﬂuent IMEC and 300 mL patient
serum was added to each well-containing conﬂuent HUVECs.
Arrays were connected to and read by an ECIS 1600R instrument
(Applied Biophysics) for four hours. Values recorded are in terms
of resistance to permeability. Data were analyzed using ECIS
software (Applied Biophysics) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software).
SVEC4-10 murine lymphatic ECs were incubated in normal
media or media with 5% ascites sera for 24 hours. Cells were then
collected, ﬁxed in 3% PFA for 15 minutes, permeabilized with
90% methanol for 30 minutes, and stained according to our
ﬂow cytometry protocol with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-VE-Cadherin
(1:100; eBioscience).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean plus or minus SEM. Statistical
comparisons between groups were performed using the Student
t test.

Results
The ID8 murine EOC model mirrors late stages of human
disease with malignant ascites
The ID8 is a well-studied murine serous EOC model (26–28).
The full complement of immune system of this model is particularly favorable to investigate the innate immune response of the
myeloid cells. The ID8 cells were marked with Renilla luciferase,
enabling longitudinal monitoring of tumor growth and dissemination by noninvasive bioluminescent imaging. For the intraperitoneal model, bioluminescent signals from the tumor cells
ﬁrst became detectable at around week 9 postinjection, which also
corresponded to the time that ascites began to accumulate (Fig.
1A), and the tumors grew rapidly from this point onward. By week
12, the tumors had grown throughout the peritoneal cavity (Fig.
1A) and ascites greatly distended the abdomen. The substantial
ascites found in each mouse was hemorrhagic and tumor nodules
had spread to the mesenteries, peritoneal wall, liver, and fat pads
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). The same pattern of peritoneal dissemination and ascites formation were also observed in the

4744 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

orthotopic ID8 model, implanted into the ovarian bursa (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Taken together, both the intraperitoneal
and intrabursal ID8 model recapitulate important characteristics
of human EOC with slow initial growth that progressed to
dispersed peritoneal metastasis, and massive ascites.
Immune and vascular dysregulation worsen as EOC progresses
Immune dysregulation in patients with cancer often results in
the systemic expansion of myeloid cell populations that can be
observed in the peripheral blood, lymphoid organs, and at the
tumor (29). This expansion of circulating and inﬁltrating myeloid
cells is also associated with worse prognosis (16). Consistent with
this ﬁnding, we observed the progressive increase in the immature
myeloid cells also known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) in the peripheral blood in the ID8 model from weeks 6 to
12 after tumor injection (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Increases of
MDSCs and macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes (data
not shown) and splenomegaly (Supplementary Fig. S1D) were
also observed consistently. The systemic expansion of the myeloid
population was also manifested in the tumor, resulting in a
signiﬁcant increase in TAM content over time (Supplementary
Fig. S1E).
Next we analyzed the immune cell content in the ascites ﬂuid
and found that macrophages and ﬂoating tumor cells were the
majority of viable cells in the ascites ﬂuid at both week 10 (the
eventual start time of treatments) and week 12 (Fig. 1B). The
immune cells in ID8 ascites consist of a high proportion of
immunosuppressive and protumorigenic subtype, as the
MHCII M2 to MHCIIþ M1 macrophage and CD4 to CD8 Tcell ratios were both around 3 to 1 at week 12, an increase from the
ratios at week 10 (Fig. 1C). Large numbers of macrophages and a
high ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cell inﬁltration have previously been
associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (30). We modiﬁed
this immune cell signature by including the cell ratio of M2 to M1
macrophages in the ascites ﬂuid.
The hemorrhagic nature of the ascites in the ID8 model indicates that vascular leakage and extravasation of red blood cells is
occurring. Hence, the ID8 tumor-bearing mice developed severe
anemia in the late stages of the disease (Fig. 1D). Close examination of mesentery blood vasculature revealed that by week 12
the vasculature was highly disorganized (Fig. 2A), with greatly
increased vessel density (Fig. 2B), vessel width (Fig. 2C), and
number of branch points (Fig. 2D). The in vivo vascular function in
the animals was further examined with the Miles assay, which
assess vascular leakage by the extravasation of Evans Blue dye from
circulation into tissues, and a lectin perfusion assay. ID8 tumorbearing mice displayed clear vascular leakage compared with
na€ve animals (Supplementary Fig. S1F). In contrast to the robust
lectin perfusion observed in the mesentery capillaries of na€ve
animals, the vessel perfusion function in the mesentery capillaries
of tumor-bearing mice was signiﬁcantly decreased, to about 25%
of normal (Fig. 2E). No notable difference in perfusion in the
larger mesentery arterioles was observed between tumor-bearing
and na€ve animals (data not shown), indicating that the leakage of
blood and ascites ﬂuid is occurring at the capillary level. Parallel
the dysregulated blood vasculature, tumor-bearing mice displayed increased lymphatic density in the mesentery (Supplementary Fig. S1G), and tortuous lymphatics with enlarged lumen
(Supplementary Fig. S1H). Although these ﬁndings are consistent
with known lymphatic vascular and lymph drainage dysfunction
in EOC malignant ascites (31, 32), they require further functional

veriﬁcation. Sufﬁce to say, the preclinical data presented so far
support that macrophages are playing a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of EOC malignant ascites. To further verify this
assertion, we pursued a therapeutic approach to block macrophage function in the ID8 EOC model.
Suppressing macrophage function with CSF1R blockade
ameliorated the vascular dysfunction of malignant ascites of
EOC
Because the CSF-1/CSF1R axis is known to be a critical pathway
in the development and function of myeloid cells and macrophages, we used a highly selective CSF1R inhibitor, GW2580 (33),
to treat mice during the late stages of ID8 EOC. We and others have
shown that GW2580 is able to selectively and effectively inhibit
the protumorigenic functions of TAMs in several tumor models,
including prostate, breast, and lung cancer (34–36). A confounding issue in EOC is that CSF-1 and CSF1R were found to be
expressed in human ovarian cancer and this signaling pathway has
been implicated to have a tumor-intrinsic role in promoting EOC

oncogenesis (23). Although ID8 tumor cells express a moderate
level of CSF-1 comparing to several other human EOC lines
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), this model expresses negligible level
of CSF1R that is more than 5 orders of magnitude below that
expressed in a macrophage cell line and bone marrow derived
macrophages (data not shown), and 5- to 10-fold lower than three
other human ovarian cancer lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Furthermore, unlike macrophages, ID8 cells were not responsive
to CSF1 induction or CSF1R blockade in vitro (34) (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D) and subcutaneous ID8 tumor growth was
not affected by GW250 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
There were also no off-target effects or organ toxicity with the
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2F; refs. 33, 34). Thus, we conclude that the therapeutic action of CSF1R inhibition is directed at
macrophages and not at the ID8 tumor cells.
Female mice-bearing intraperitoneal implanted ID8 tumors
were allowed to progress to late stage, when ascites developed,
and then treated with diluent or GW2580 for 2 more weeks (Fig.
3A). Control diluent-treated mice continued to accumulate ascites

whereas GW2580 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of
ascites, down from an average volume of 6.2 mL/control animal
to 1.9 mL/treated animal (Fig. 3B), and prevented the development of severe anemia (Fig. 3C). Notably, GW2580 treatment
signiﬁcantly altered the content of macrophages in the ascites.
More than the 2 weeks of treatment course, the percentage of
ﬂoating ascites macrophages in the control cohort increased
signiﬁcantly whereas those in the GW2580-treated ascites reduced
signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3D). For instance, in one experiment, the
absolute number of M2 macrophages decreased from 41.9 
15.9 to 2.9  1.7 million (P < 0.05), the absolute number of M1
macrophages was not signiﬁcantly affected by the GW2580 treatment, and CD8 T cell increased from 0.68  0.16 to 2.2  1.4
million in ascites by GW2580 treatment (Fig. 3E, Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Notably, the high 3:1 ratio of M2:M1 macrophage and
CD4:CD8 T cell were reduced to approximately 1:1 by GW2580
treatment (Fig. 3F). Signiﬁcantly more of the GW-treated ascites
macrophages expressed CCR2 (Fig. 3G), and many more of those

4746 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

macrophages expressed IFNg and IL12 compared with control
ascites macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). These
results indicate that inhibiting macrophage function with CSF1R
blockade was able to reverse the protumorigenic, immunosuppressive phenotypes of the ascites immune cells.
Given the signiﬁcant reduction of ascites ﬂuid volume, the
critical issue to unveil is the impact of CSF1R blockade on the
peritoneal vasculature. Upon staining of the mesentery blood
vasculature, a clear normalization was seen in GW2580-treated
mice (Fig. 4A). Along with the reduction in vessel density (Fig.
4B), there is a concomitant decrease in vessel width (Fig. 4C),
tortuosity, and branch points (Fig. 4D). We further explored the
blood vascular dysregulation in a second EOC model, namely the
human OVCAR3 xenograft model. As seen in Fig. 4E, GW2580
treatment again normalized the dysregulated mesentery blood
vasculature as indicated by a signiﬁcant reduction of vessel
density, width, and branch points (Fig. 4F–H). The lymphatic
vasculature density and the tortuosity and patent lumen of the

lymphatics are all decreased with GW2580 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E).
To further assess the vascular leakage-causing potential of
malignant ascites, we performed additional EC permeability
assays with control or GW2580-treated mouse ascites sera. As
shown in Fig. 5A, unlike normal murine blood serum that did not
alter the (ECIS) EC permeability over 4 hours, the ascites serum
from control (untreated) ID8 tumor-bearing animals induced a

reduction in EC resistance, reaching a level that is about 15% to
20% below normal blood serum. In contrast, the addition of
ascites sera from GW2580-treated mice resulted in an immediate
increase in EC resistance reaching a level that is 15% higher than
control mouse sera. Although the magnitude of change in EC
resistance was not large, the direction of change was very consistent. Analyses on ascites sera from seven control and seven GWtreated mice across three different studies showed a signiﬁcant

increase in EC resistance in the GW-treated over control mice ( , P
< 0.01; Fig. 5B). Endothelial permeability is regulated by cell–cell
adherens junctions, which are largely composed of vascular
endothelial cadherin (37). The downregulation of this endothelium-speciﬁc cadherin from the plasma membrane of ECs leads to
increased vascular permeability (38). The ability of ascites sera to
induce endothelial permeability was further assessed by their
impact on the surface VE-cadherin expression on the ECs. Incubating ECs with control (untreated) ascites serum led to a significant downregulation of VE-cadherin expression (relative to normal media), whereas GW-treated ascites did not signiﬁcantly
reduced VE-cadherin expression (Fig. 5C).
The improvement of in vivo vascular function upon CSF1R
blockade was further veriﬁed by the signiﬁcant increase in the
number of perfused, blood-carrying capillaries (Fig. 5D) and
the reduced vascular leakage assessed by the Miles assay (Fig.
5E) in the mesentery of GW2580-treated mice compared with
that from the untreated control. Notably, the increased vascular
leakage was largely limited to the tumor-bearing peritoneal
compartment as no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the
muscles of na€ve, control- or GW-treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S3F). Although VEGF is well-known to contribute to
both blood and lymphatic vascular dysregulation in cancer, the
vascular normalization observed with GW2580 treatment happened without a change in the very high VEGF levels observed
in the ascites serum of ID8 EOC model (Supplementary Fig.
S3G). This result suggests that other factor(s) may be counteracting the impact of VEGF as a result of the CSF1R blocking
treatment.

Although the main focus here is to decipher the inﬂuences of
myeloid cells/macrophages on malignant ascites, it is clear that
the CSF1R blockade treatment has a major systemic impact. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, GW2580 treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced peripheral blood MDSCs (Supplementary Fig. S3H),
spleen weight (Supplementary Fig. S3I), and splenic myeloid
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3J), and macrophages in lymph nodes
(Supplementary Fig. S3K). CSF1R blockade also signiﬁcantly
reduced TAMs in the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S3L). Similar
to what was seen in the ID8 model, the TAMs in the OVCAR3
model showed signiﬁcant polarization toward a less protumorigenic phenotype with GW2580 treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S3M and S3N). This appeared to be due to an inﬂux of the M1
macrophages upon treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3O). Of
interest, the short 2-week GW2580 treatment appeared to reduce
the overall intraperitoneal tumor burden in both the ID8 model
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B) and the OVCAR3 model
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). In light of the same treatment having
no effect on subcutaneous tumor burden (Supplementary Fig.
S2E), we conclude that the ascites microenvironment becoming
unfavorable for tumor growth could be the cause.
Increased macrophage presence in patient ascites predicts EC
permeability
Next, we explored whether the macrophage ﬁndings in the
murine models corroborate those in patients with EOC. In freshly
isolated samples of ascites ﬂuid from patients, macrophages and
ﬂoating tumor cells again constituted the majority of viable
cells in the ascites ﬂuid (Fig. 6A). The M2 macrophages (CD33þ

(CD33þ CD68þ MHCIIþ CD206) by almost 3:1 and CD4 T
cells outnumber CD8 T cells by more than 3:1 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the proportion and phenotype of the patients' ascites
immune cells is almost identical to that of the ID8 model (Fig. 1B
and C, Supplementary Fig. S5).
The ability of patients' ascites serum to induce vascular permeability of HUVECs was measured by the ECIS assay. Analyses on
ﬁve patient ascites sera showed that the 2-hour mark represent the
inﬂection point of this assay, where the EC resistance began to
change (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the macrophage content in the
ascites (as % of live cells) signiﬁcantly correlated with the inverse
of EC resistance (Fig. 6D). In another words, the higher the
number of macrophages in a patient's ascites, the higher the
vascular permeability (i.e., loss of EC resistance) when the ascites
serum is placed on ECs. These results from clinical specimens are
suggestive of a pathological contribution of macrophages to
vascular dysfunction, reminiscent of our ﬁndings in the murine
models.
Collectively, the results from this therapeutic study support that
protumorigenic macrophages are playing an instrumental role in
the vascular dysfunction causing EOC malignant ascites. Inhibiting the macrophages' function with selective CSF1R blockade not

only dramatically reversed the vascular pathology but also
improved systematic environment that might be more favorable
to reject the tumor. Thus, inhibiting the protumorigenic inﬂuences of myeloid cells/macrophages could be a part of a comprehensive treatment plan, to improve the outcome of EOC.

Discussion
Malignant ascites is a devastating complication of EOC that
greatly lowers the quality of life of patients at late stages of the
disease (2). Current treatment options for malignant ascites are
largely ineffective and have high rate of complications (2). Recent
research and results from clinical trials showed that VEGF is a
promising therapeutic target, especially for malignant ascites (11–
14). However, the notable risk of severe and even deadly side
effects coupled with the lack of long-term survival beneﬁts of
VEGF-targeted therapies raised signiﬁcant concern on their use. In
this study, we postulate that broadening the therapeutic target to a
particular immune cell population, namely macrophages, could
be advantageous over VEGF-speciﬁc approaches. The protumorigenic TAMs are known to promote angiogenesis through VEGF
dependent and independent means and heightening the immunosuppressive state of tumor microenvironment (16, 17). Thus,

simultaneously blocking multiple prongs of TAMs' inﬂuences
might be more effective than blocking the single VEGF axis.
Several high-impact studies published recently highlighted that
CSF1R inhibition, by either monoclonal antibody or selective
small molecule kinase inhibitors, can improve the outcome of
different types of cancer in preclinical and clinical settings (39–
42), by speciﬁcally reducing the protumorigenic M2 macrophage
subtype and functions (40–42). The results of this study reinforce
the same concept that selective blockade of CSF1R signaling
reduces the number of M2 macrophages and their function, which
reverses the vascular leakage of EOC malignant ascites. We
observed higher macrophage content in human ascites sera was
associated with increased vascular permeability. In murine EOC
models, M2 macrophages expanded and inﬁltrated the peritoneal
vasculature over time and were linked to progressive vascular
dysregulation, leaky vessels, and ascites formation. Using a wellstudied selective CSF1R inhibitor, GW2580, (33–36, 43) to block
macrophage function in late stages of EOC reversed the vascular
dysfunction and greatly reduced ascites accumulation. We deduce
that the vascular normalization is secondary to the lowered M2
macrophage contributions as the reduction of total macrophages
in ascites after GW2580 treatment was predominantly due to
reductions in the MHC-negative M2 population, whereas M1
macrophages are affected less appreciably. Consequently,
GW2580 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of
M1 macrophages, expressing CCR2, IL12, and IFNg. Furthermore,
the improvement of macrophage polarization status was accompanied by an increase of the CD8/CD4 T-cell ratio and hence,
lowering the immunosuppressive state of tumor microenvironment, as observed in recent studies (30, 42). In total, these recent
ﬁndings all support that selective CSF1R inhibition can improve
cancer outcome by lowering the protumorigenic activities of M2
macrophages, which promotes the vascular dysregulation of EOC
malignant ascites reported here.

4750 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

We deduced that one component of the macrophage-mediated
vascular dysfunction is dictated through soluble factors as cell-free
ascites sera from untreated animals induced higher EC permeability. In this exploratory study, we did not address the speciﬁc
soluble factor(s) induced by macrophages that might be promoting or protecting vascular permeability in malignant ascites of
EOC. However, we believe VEGF is not the culprit. VEGF protein
levels in the ID8 ascites is very high, several orders of magnitude
higher than in peripheral blood. In GW2580-treated ascites sera,
VEGF levels remained very high, often exceeding that of untreated
sera. It is interesting to note that ascites serum from GW2580treated mice consistently induced a higher EC resistance when
compared with normal blood serum. This result could indicate
the presence of a protective factor(s) against vascular leak in the
GW-treated sera, especially to counteract the permeability effects
of VEGF.
Another layer of complexity in this macrophage-induced
vascular dysfunction is the close cell–cell contact and crosstalk between macrophages and EC cells that have been reported
in developmental and pathological settings. Our recent study
showed that ECs provide a speciﬁc niche for the proliferation
and differentiation of macrophages (44) and macrophages are
often recruited to sites of vascular remodeling during embryonic development (45). Kubota and colleagues (46) showed
that macrophages play a key role in pathological neovascularization of ischemic retinopathy. Reduction of the macrophages' number and function either by genetic deletion of
CSF-1 (M-CSF) or by a CSF1R (c-fms) kinase inhibitor,
Ki20227, was able to correct the vascular pathology. In oncology, physical interactions between macrophages and endothelial cells has been described in the context of breast cancer
metastasis facilitation (47, 48). Clearly, the functional crosstalk between macrophages and ECs is an important topic in
cancer and vascular biology.

Targeting CSF1R to Block TAMs Eases EOC Malignant Ascites

Although the precise molecular mechanism of the macrophagedriven vascular dysfunction is yet to be determined, our results
support that therapies that inhibit macrophage functions will be a
rational strategy to manage ascites. Because CSF1/CSF1R is a
dominant driver pathway in the function of TAMs, it is a promising target and there is a wealth of pharmacological agents
available to inhibit this axis. For instance, selective monoclonal
antibodies that target either the ligand or the receptor, and
numerous small molecule CSF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
exhibiting variable target selectivity, have been developed in the
last 10 years (33, 39–41). Many of these agents are in early phase
clinical investigation for inﬂammatory diseases and cancer. The
CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 is the furthest along in clinical testing,
especially in oncology application (39). Paralleling our ﬁnding
that daily oral GW2580 regimen (160 mg/kg) given to mice over 1
month resulted in no discernable toxicity, early clinical trial
ﬁndings showed that PLX3397 appeared to be well tolerated in
patients with advanced cancer (39).
Recent therapeutic developments for EOC favored intraperitoneal-directed cisplatin delivery as this route was shown to prolong
the survival of patients over systemic delivery (49). We believe
that it might not be beneﬁcial to administer the TAMs blockade
therapy described here by intraperitoneal route even though it is
directed mainly to relieve a peritoneal-based complication.
Recent reports published by our group and others demonstrated
that the beneﬁt of inhibiting TAMs inﬁltration and function is
systemic and not tumor or tissue-conﬁned as this treatment can
greatly improve the outcomes of conventional cancer therapies,
such as antiangiogenesis therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
and vaccine therapy in prostate cancers (34, 35), lung cancers, and
breast cancers (30). Here, we showed that CSF1R blockade
resulted in systemic reduction of immunosuppressive MDSCs
and thus lowering the tumor supportive environment, which in
turn could contribute to the lowered tumor burden observed.
Given these promising ﬁndings, the combination of TAMs blockade with conventional chemotherapy treatment might be particular fruitful for EOC.
Given the very heterogeneous nature of human EOC and the
known plasticity of myeloid cell and macrophage subtypes in
cancer, a critical issue for clinical translation of TAM blockade

strategy is to determine which patients might be responsive to
CSF1/CSF1R-targeted or other TAM-targeted therapy. Clearly, the
promising prospects of this therapeutic strategy warrant more
study and attention pay to myeloid cells' contribution to the
aggressive and resistant nature of EOC. This knowledge could lead
to more rationale therapeutic strategies to improve the current
poor outcome for EOC.
