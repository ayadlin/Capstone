ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance is often associated with other clinical characteristics such as
enhanced migratory/invasive potential. However, the correlation and underlying
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the
function of the miR-222-ABCG2 pathway in the correlation between cisplatin (DDP)
resistance and enhanced cell migration/invasion in tongue squamous cell carcinoma
(TSCC). Using TSCC cell lines and primary cultures from TSCC cases, we first confirmed
the correlation among DDP resistance (measured by IC50 values and ABCG2/ERCC1
expression), migratory/invasive potential (assessed by migration/invasion assays)
and miR-222 expression. In TSCC cells, siRNA-mediated ABCG2 knockdown led to
enhanced DDP responsiveness and reduced migratory/invasive potential, whereas
ABCG2 overexpression induced DDP resistance and enhanced cell migration/invasion.
Luciferase assays revealed that ABCG2 is a direct target of miR-222. In addition to
reducing cell migration/invasion, functional analyses in TSCC cells indicated that
miR-222 can reduce expression of the ABCG2 gene and enhance DDP responsiveness.
However, co-transfection with ABCG2 cDNA restored both DDP resistance and
migration/invasion. Moreover, miR-222 mimics and ABCG2 siRNA inhibited tumor
growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Thus, our results verified that DDP resistance
is correlated with enhanced migratory/invasive potential in TSCC. ABCG2 is a direct
target of miR-222,and deregulation of the miR-222-ABCG2 regulatory module in TSCC
contributes to both DDP resistance and enhanced migratory/invasive potential.

INTRODUCTION

TSCC, important clinical problems of DDP toxicity as well
as intrinsic/acquired chemoresistance must be addressed
[2, 3]. An even more serious issue was elucidated
through a series of studies indicating that cancer cell
migration and invasion are involved in the development
of drug resistance [4, 5]. Indeed, many recent studies
have found that chemoresistance and tumor migratory/
invasive potential are the primary causes of treatment
failure and mortality in cancer patients; however, the
correlation and mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous

Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the
most common carcinoma in the oral and maxillofacial
region and is characterized by rapid local invasion and
migration. Cisplatin (DDP) is a standard chemotherapeutic
agent that is effective for the treatment of TSCC, both as
a single agent and in combination with other drugs [1].
Although treatment with DDP-based chemotherapy has
been found to improve the prognosis of patients with

study using TSCC cell lines revealed that DDP-induced
chemoresistance caused the cells to undergo the epithelialmesenchymal transition, a process that was accompanied
by enhanced migration/invasion [6].
The ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2
(ABCG2) encodes a membrane transporter belonging to
the ABC superfamily of membrane transporters, which are
involved in the trafficking of biologic molecules across
cell membranes [7]. Many studies have found that ABCG2
plays an important role in the efflux of xenobiotics,
protecting cells against the damage caused by extraneous
substances or drugs [8-10]. Furthermore, ABCG2
inhibitors enable the regulation of chemoresistance pumps
and decrease cancer cell survival and are promising due
to their minimal adverse effects to cancer patients [11].
Recent work has also suggested that ABCG2 might
be closely associated with invasion and metastasis in
tumors [7, 12]. For example, Xie et al. found that ABCG2
overexpression was responsible for chemotherapy failure,
tumor recurrence and invasion in colon cancer [12].
MicroRNAs are essential regulators of diverse cellular
processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
survival, motility, invasion and morphogenesis [13], and
deregulation of microRNAs has been observed in many
tumor types, including TSCC [14]. In our previous studies,
numerous deregulated microRNAs, such as miR-7, miR24, miR-99, miR-138, miR-181a and miR-222, were found
to be related to migration/invasion in TSCC [13, 15-18].
miR-222 was found to reduce cell invasion by indirectly
decreasing MMP1 expression by targeting SOD2 mRNA;
thus, it might serve as a novel therapeutic target for TSCC
patients at risk of metastatic disease [13]. Although several
microRNAs that can target ABCG2, including miR-142-3p
[19], miR-145 [20] and miR-487a [21], have recently been
found, the relationship between miR-222 and ABCG2 has
not yet been elucidated.
To investigate whether DDP resistance correlates
with migratory/invasive potential in TSCC and whether
this relationship is controlled by the miR-222-ABCG2
module, we first investigated the correlation among DDP
resistance, as assessed by IC50 values and ABCG2/
ERCC1 expression, migratory/invasive potential, as
assessed by migration and invasion assays, and miR-222
expression in TSCC cell lines and primary cultural cells
from TSCC cases. Next, we investigated the involvement
of ABCG2 in DDP resistance and migration/invasion by
ABCG2 knockdown and overexpression in TSCC cells.
We determined that miR-222 directly targets ABCG2 in
TSCC cells, resulting in enhanced DDP resistance and
migratory/invasive potential. Finally, the effects of miR222 and ABCG2 on tumor growth and lung metastasis in
vivo were evaluated.

DDP resistance, migration/invasion and miR-222
expression in TSCC
To investigate DDP resistance, DDP IC50 values
and ABCG2/ERCC1 expression were assessed in TSCC
cells. As shown in Figure 1A, the primary cultural cells
obtained from Case 6 were the least sensitive to DDP,
with the highest IC50 values compared to the primary
cells obtained from the other five cases. The clinical
characteristics of the TSCC cases are presented in Table
S1. The lowest IC50 values were found for Cases 1 and
3, with no statistical significance between them, whereas
mid-range IC50 values were found for Cases 2, 4 and 5
(Figure 1A, Table S2). As shown in Figure 1B, Figure
S1A-S1B (quantification of western blot results) and
Table S2, Case 6 exhibited the highest expression of
ABCG2/ERCC1 (i.e., DDP resistance). Cases 1, 2, 3 and
5 displayed low ABCG2 expression and Case 4 mid-range
expression; for ERCC1, Case 3 had the lowest expression
and Cases 1, 2, 4 and 5 mid-range expression. With respect
to TSCC cell lines, UM2 cells showed significantly lower
IC50 values (Figure 2A, Table S3) and ABCG2/ERCC1
expression levels (Figure 2B, Figure S1C-S1D, Table S3)
compared to UM1 and CAL27 cells. The exact p values
between groups of TSCC primary cultural cells and cell
lines are shown in Tables S2 and S3.
The migration and invasion potentials of TSCC cells
are shown in Figure 1C-1D and Figure 2C-2D. Primary
cells obtained from Case 6 (with higher DDP resistance)
exhibited significantly higher migration activity compared
to primary cells from Cases 1, 3, 4 and 5 (with lower
DDP resistance) (Figure 1C and Table S2); Cases 1 and
3 exhibited the lowest migration activity, whereas midrange migration activity was found for Cases 2, 4 and
5. In addition, Case 6 had significantly higher invasion
potential compared to Cases 1, 2, 3 and 5, as shown in
Figure 1D and Table S2; Cases 1 and 3 exhibited the
lowest invasion potential and Cases 2, 4 and 5 mid-range
potential. Regarding the TSCC cell lines, UM2 cells (with
lower DDP resistance) had significantly lower migration/
invasion activity than UM1 and CAL27 cells (with higher
DDP resistance) (Figure 2C-2D,Table S3). Moreover,
higher Slug expression (a metastasis-related gene) was
found in Case 6 as well as UM1 cells, which are DDP
resistant (Figure 1B-2B, Tables S2-S3).
Quantitative qRT-PCR was used to investigate the
differential expression of miR-222 in TSCC cells. We
found signiÔ¨Åcant down-regulation of miR-222 in primary
cells obtained from Case 6 compared to those from Cases
1, 3 and 5; the cells from these three cases exhibited the
highest expression of miR-222. In contrast, cells from
cases 2 and 4 showed mid-range miR-222 expression

Correlation among DDP resistance, migratory/

TSCC

ABCG2 overexpression promotes DDP resistance
and migration/invasion potential in TSCC
To investigate the effects of ABCG2 on DDP
resistance and migration/invasion potential, we
overexpressed ABCG2 in UM1 cells. The UM1 cell
line was selected because it is more easily transfected
with plasmid than UM2 cells (data not shown). ABCG2
protein abundance was signiÔ¨Åcantly increased in UM1
cells after transfection with a plasmid containing ABCG2
cDNA (Figure 3A), and UM1 cells overexpressing
ABCG2 displayed increased expression of ERCC1
and Slug (Figure 3A) and IC50 values of DDP (Figure
3B) compared to control plasmid-transfected cells.
Furthermore, ABCG2 overexpression also resulted in
increased migration/invasion abilities in UM1 cells
(Figure 3C, Figure 3D). These results indicated that
ABCG2 overexpression promoted DDP resistance and
migration/invasion potential in TSCC cell lines.

We further investigated a correlation among
DDP resistance (IC50 values and ABCG2/ERCC1
expression), migration/invasion and miR-222 expression
in TSCC cells. As shown in Table 1, strong correlations
were found between IC50 values of DDP and ABCG2/
ERCC1 expression levels, between IC50 values and
migration/invasion potential, and between IC50 values
and miR-222 expression. Moreover, strong correlations
were found between migration/invasion potential and
ABCG2/ERCC1 expression, between migration/invasion
potential and miR-222 expression, and between ABCG2/
ERCC1 expression and that of miR-222. Finally, strong
correlations were found between migration and invasion
potential and between the expression of ABCG2 and
ERCC1 in TSCC cells. These results indicated correlations
among DDP resistance, migratory/invasive potential and
miR-222 expression in TSCC cells.

Furthermore, the effect of miR-222 on luciferase activity
was abolished when the seed regions of the targeting sites
were mutated (pGL-ABCG2m).
To confirm the role of the miR-222-ABCG2
pathway in TSCC, a functional analysis was performed
to test the effects of miR-222 on DDP resistance and cell
migration/invasion. Transfection of miR-222 mimics
into UM1 cells led to a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant increase
in miR-222 levels (Figure 5C) that was accompanied
by reductions in the expression of ABCG2, ERCC1 and
Slug (Figure 5D). IC50 values of DDP (Figure 6A) and
cell migration (Figure 6B) and invasion (Figure 6C)
were all significantly decreased in UM1 cells following
transfection with miR-222 mimics. Similar results were
also found in CAL27 cells after transfection with miR-222
mimics (Figure S3). Moreover, when co-transfection with
ABCG2 cDNA IC50 values (Figure S4A), expression of
ABCG2, ERCC1 and Slug (Figure S4B), and migration/
invasion potential (Figure S4C, Figure S4D) was
increased in UM1 cells transfected with miR-222 mimics.
Furthermore, when UM2 cells were treated with miR-222
LNA, a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in miR-222 was
observed. The expression levels of ABCG2, ERCC1 and
Slug (Figure 5D), IC50 values (Figure 6D), migration
(Figure 6E) and invasion (Figure 6F) were all significantly
increased.
To further confirm the role of ABCG2 and miR-222
in the growth and metastasis of TSCC in vivo, xenograft
growth and lung metastasis in nude mice were performed.

knocked down the expression of ABCG2 using RNA
interference. The protein level of ABCG2 was signiÔ¨Åcantly
decreased in UM1 cells after transfection with ABCG2
siRNA (Figure 4A), with decreased expression of ERCC1
and Slug (Figure 4A) and IC50 values of DDP (Figure 4B)
compared to control siRNA-transfected cells. Furthermore,
ABCG2 knockdown also resulted in decreased migration/
invasion abilities (Figure 4C, Figure 4D) in UM1 cells.
Similar results were also found in CAL27 cells after
transfection with ABCG2 siRNA (Figure S2).

A targeting site for hsa-miR-222 was identified
in the 3‚Äô-UTR of ABCG2 mRNA (Figure 5A), and dual
luciferase reporter assays were performed to conÔ¨Årm that
miR-222 directly targets this sequence. As illustrated in
Figure 5B, when cells were co-transfected with miR222 mimics and luciferase reporter constructs carrying
pGL-ABCG2, luciferase activity was signiÔ¨Åcantly
reduced relative to cells that were co-transfected with

ABCG2 siRNA or miR222 mimics were inoculated
subcutaneously into nude mice. As shown in Figure 7A,
tumor growth was signiÔ¨Åcantly suppressed in the group
infected with ABCG2 siRNA relative to the group infected
with control siRNA. The tumor doubling time was 3.6
days (control siRNA) and 6.6 days (ABCG2 siRNA),
and the tumor inhibition rate on day 22 was 64.8% for
the group treated with ABCG2 siRNA. As shown in
Figure 7B, tumor growth was signiÔ¨Åcantly suppressed
in the group treated with miR-222 mimics relative to the
group treated with control mimics. The tumor doubling
time was 4.2 days (control mimics) and 5.8 days (miR222 mimics), and the tumor inhibition rate on day 22 was
52.4% for the group treated with miR-222 mimics. UM1
cells stably infected with lentivirus containing ABCG2
siRNA or miR222 mimics were also injected into the tail
vein of nude mice, and metastatic nodules in the lungs
were conÔ¨Årmed histologically and counted. The mice
injected with ABCG2 siRNA-infected cells exhibited
a significantly reduced number of metastatic nodules
relative to those injected with control siRNA-infected
cells (Figure 7C), as did the mice injected with miR-222

Taken together, our data demonstrated that the miR222-ABCG2 pathway is related to DDP resistance and
migration/invasion potential in TSCC.

effective method for the treatment of tongue cancer,
chemoresistance has become a major chemotherapeutic
obstacle. In the majority of studies, IC50 values following
DDP treatment have been used to measure DDP resistance
[22-24]: tissues with lower IC50 values are considered
to be highly sensitive to drug treatment, whereas those
with higher IC50 values are less sensitive. ABCG2 and
ERCC1 can both serve as chemoresistance markers for
most types of cancer [10, 25], and in the present study,
we measured the IC50 values of DDP and the expression
levels of ABCG2/ERCC1 to investigate DDP resistance in
TSCC cells. We found that TSCC cells with higher IC50
values for DDP had significantly higher expression of
ABCG2 and ERCC1 compared to TSCC cells with lower
IC50 values. Furthermore, our data demonstrated a strong
correlation of IC50 values with chemoresistance markers
(ABCG2 and ERCC1). ABCG2 expression was also
correlated with ERCC1 expression. The data confirmed
that in addition to higher levels of ABCG2 and ERCC1
expression, TSCC cells with higher IC50 values are DDP
resistant. Therefore, the combined detection of IC50 and
ABCG2/ERCC1 expression may be highly effective at
predicting DDP resistance.
Chemoresistance and tumor migratory/invasive
potential are the main causes of treatment failure and
mortality in cancer patients [26]. Recently, a series
of studies indicated that migratory/invasive potential
is involved in drug resistance in cancer cells: high
migration/invasion activity was shown to enhance
chemoresistance in tumor cells in pancreatic cancer,
breast cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer [4,

27-29]. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been shown
to induce migratory/invasive potential in several types of
cancers [30-33], including head and neck carcinoma [31].
Although the above studies provide strong evidence of
an association between chemoresistance and migratory/
invasive potential, none have indicated a specific
correlation between this potential and DDP resistance.
In the present study, we found that TSCC cell lines as
well as cells from cases exhibiting lower migratory/
invasive potential were more highly sensitive to DDP
(lower IC50 values and ABCG2/ERCC1 expression) than
cells with higher migratory/invasive potential. Thus, a
strong correlation between DDP resistance (IC50 values,
ABCG2 or ERCC1 expression) and migration/invasion
was also found. These findings suggest that cellular DDP
resistance might be related to the migratory/invasive
potential of TSCC, and novel strategies to fight against
chemoresistance should be pursued to prevent enhanced
migration/invasion.
ABCG2 has previously been found to play an
important role in chemotherapy failure and migration/
invasion in a variety of cancers, including colorectal
[34], esophageal [11], and head and neck [35]. In human
tissues, ABCG2 was found to be strongly expressed in
OSCC but not in normal mucosa [36]. Additionally, it has
been reported that ABCG2 expression is deregulated in
tongue cancer and significantly associated with regional
lymph node metastasis and local recurrence [10, 35, 36].
In the present study, we found ABCG2 expression to be
strongly correlated with IC50 values, ERCC1 expression,
and migration/invasion potential in both TSCC cell lines
and primary cultures from TSCC cases. In TSCC cells,
ABCG2 overexpression was found to increase IC50
values and expression of a chemoresistance-related protein
(ERCC1); these cells concurrently exhibited increased
migratory/invasive properties. In contrast, knockdown
of ABCG2 in TSCC cells decreased IC50 values and
ERCC1 expression, concurrent with reduced migration/
invasion abilities. These data indicated that ABCG2 has
an important function in DDP resistance and migratory/
invasive potential in TSCC cells.
The mechanisms of miRNA-mediated target genes
might contribute to various biological functions via
multifactorial interactions that involve different biological
pathways [37, 38]. In a previous study, we found that miR222 plays an important role in TSCC invasion and might
therefore serve as a novel therapeutic target for TSCC
patients at risk of metastatic disease [13]. Although many
target genes for miR-222 have been identiÔ¨Åed, including
matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), superoxide dismutase
2 (SOD2), p27 [13], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
3 (TIMP3) [39] and GNAI3 [40], few have been
functionally implicated in both the chemoresistance
and migratory/invasive potential of TSCC. However,
our present study demonstrates that miR-222 directly
targets ABCG2. A strong correlation between miR-222
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression and DDP resistance, as well as between miR222 expression and migration/invasion was found. The upregulation of miR-222 led to decreased IC50 values and
induced the expression of ABCG2 and ERCC1, concurrent
with decreased migration/invasion potential. In contrast,
miR-222 knockdown in TSCC resulted in an increase in
IC50 values, ABCG2/ERCC1 expression, and migration/
invasion. Moreover, miR-222 mimics and ABCG2 siRNA
signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis
in vivo. These data reveal that miR-222-ABCG2 has an
important function in the chemoresistance and metastatic
potential of TSCC cells.
In consideration of the data presented above, we
conclude that there is a correlation between IC50 values
of DDP and ABCG2/ERCC1 gene expression. Therefore,
concurrent detection of IC50 values and ABCG2/
ERCC1 expression might constitute an effective method
of predicting DDP resistance. In TSCC, DDP resistance
is correlated with migration/invasion and miR-222
expression, which means that patients presenting with
DDP resistance have more highly migratory/invasive
cancer. Thus, alternative therapeutic regimens must
be implemented for such patients. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that ABCG2 is a direct target of miR-222
and that it plays an important role in chemoresistance and
migration/invasion in TSCC. Thus, our data reveal the
therapeutic target miR-222-ABCG2 regulatory module
as a promising predictive signaling pathway for TSCC
patients with high levels of DDP resistance and migration/
invasion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cultural cells
Archived tissue samples for primary cultural cells
taken from six patients with TSCC were used in the
present study. All of the patients underwent curative
surgery, and none received any adjuvant therapy prior to
surgery. The present study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen
University (2014-C-001). Among the TSCC cases, Case
6 had LN metastasis and experienced a recurrence of
cancer after one month; this patient died seven months
after surgery. In contrast, none of the other five cases were
found to have LN metastasis, and Cases 1, 2, 4 and 5 had
no recurrence during the 6-27 months of follow-up.
Primary cultural cells were maintained as previously
described [41]. Briefly, TSCC tissues were disinfected
with Betaisodona (Mundipharma, Limburg, Germany),
rinsed twice in PBS, minced and placed in 2.5 mg/ml
Dispase II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in DMEM
for 18 to 24 h at 4¬∞C. Subsequently, the tissues were
incubated in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min; trypsin

activity was stopped using DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Tissue suspensions were centrifuged,
resuspended in DMEM/F12 (containing 10% FBS, 1000
U/ml penicillin and 500 Œºg/ml streptomycin), and cultured
at 37¬∞C with 5% CO2. All of the ensuing experiments with
primary samples were performed within a few days after
surgery.

to the lower membrane were stained with DAPI in the
dark, imaged and counted using an inverted microscope
equipped with a digital camera. Three random Ô¨Åelds were
captured at 200√ó magniÔ¨Åcation.

Cell culture and transfection

Western blots were performed as previously
described [43] using antibodies speciÔ¨Åc for ABCG2 (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), ERCC1 (Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm,
Sweden), and Slug (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA); GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was included
as a control. The results obtained from western blotting
were quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad, CA, USA); the results are shown in Electronic
Supplementary Figure S1.

Western blot analysis

The UM1 and UM2 cells used in this study
are paired cell lines of different metastatic potentials
generated from a single patient with TSCC [13]. CAL
27 cells are a TSCC cell line resistant to DDP [42].
These cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100Œºg/ml
streptomycin at 37¬∞C in a humidiÔ¨Åed incubator with
5% CO2. For functional analysis, a plasmid containing
ABCG2 cDNA (NM_004827) and a control plasmid
(pEGFP-N1) (GeneChem, Shanghai, China) were used.
ABCG2-speciÔ¨Åc siRNA, control non-targeting siRNA
(Genepharma, Shanghai, China), miR-222 mimics, control
mimics (Genepharma, Shanghai, China), locked nucleic
acid (LNA) inhibitor for miR-222 (anti-miR-222 LNA),
and control LNA (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) were all
transfected into the appropriate cells using Lipofectamine
Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The sequences of ABCG2
siRNA, miR-222 mimics and miR-222 LNA are shown in
Table S4.

Quantitative qRT-PCR analysis
The expression levels of miR-222 in TSCC cells
were determined using a miRNeasy mini kit according to
the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol (Qiagen, Hildon, German), as
previously described [15]. Quantitative qRT-PCR reactions
were performed using a 7500 Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The relative microRNA
levels were computed using the 2-delta delta Ct analysis method,
and U6 was used as an internal reference.

Dual luciferase reporter assay

Chemoresistance detected by IC50 using CCK8
assays

Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed
to test for interactions between miR-222 and its target
sequence, as previously described [44]. In brief, a
luciferase reporter gene construct for ABCG2 (pGLABCG2) was created by cloning the 3‚Äô-UTR of ABCG2
[NM_004827, containing the miRNA-222 binding
site (5‚Äô-UGUAGCA-3‚Äô)] into the Xho I and Not I sites
of a pGL-3-Control Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Çy luciferase reporter vector
(Promega, Wisconsin, USA). The corresponding mutant
construct (pGL-ABCG2m) was created by replacing
the seed regions of the miR-222 binding sites with
5‚Äô-ACATCGT-3‚Äô. These constructs were then veriÔ¨Åed
by sequencing. Cells were transfected with the reporter
constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA,
USA). The pRL-TK vector (Promega, Wisconsin, USA)
was co-transfected to serve as an internal control for
normalization of the transfection efÔ¨Åciency. Luciferase
activity was then determined using a GloMax 20/20
luminometer (Promega, Wisconsin, USA), as previously
described [15].

Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at
a density of 5√ó103 cells/well. After 24 h of incubation,
the medium was replaced with fresh medium either with
or without various concentrations of DDP (Hospira,
Mulgrave, Australia). Cell viability was detected 24
h later using a modiÔ¨Åed Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8)
assay (Fanbo, Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. IC50 values were deÔ¨Åned as
the concentrations resulting in a 50% reduction in growth
compared to control cell growth, with higher IC50 values
indicating higher chemoresistance potential [24].

In vitro cell migration and invasion assays
Transwell assays were performed to evaluate cell
migration and invasion abilities using BD BioCoat Control
Cell Culture Inserts or BD BioCoat BD MatrigelTM
Invasion Chamber, respectively [15]. In brief, cells
were seeded into the upper Boyden chambers of cell
culture inserts. After 24 h of incubation, cells adhering

Tumorigenesis and metastasis in nude mice

REFERENCES

To investigate the involvement of ABCG2 and miR222 in tumor growth and metastasis in TSCC, CAL27
and UM1 cells stably infected with lentivirus harboring
ABCG2 siRNA / Control siRNA or miR-222 mimics
/ Control mimics (GeneChem, Shanghai, China) were
collected and resuspended in PBS. Stably infected CAL27
cells (1√ó107/0.2ml) were inoculated subcutaneously into
the right Ô¨Çank of 4-week-old female BALB/c nude mice
(purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.,
Hunan, China). Tumor volumes were calculated as 0.5
√ó length √ó width2, and the tumor growth curve (y = A e
kday
), tumor doubling times (ln2/k) and tumor inhibition
rate were obtained as previously described [15]. For
metastasis assays, the stably infected UM1 cells (2 √ó 106
/0.2 ml) were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c nude
mice. The animals were sacriÔ¨Åced after six weeks, and
metastatic tumors in the lung were assessed as previously
described [15]. No mice showed a notable toxic effect or
body weight loss during the experiment. The animal study
was approved by the ethics committee of our institution
(2014-C-001).

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS,
Chicago, IL), Version 13.0. Correlations between DDP
resistance and cell migration/invasion were tested using
Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation. The data were analyzed
with Student‚Äôs t test to determine significance between
two groups or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
to calculate significance when there were more than
two groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.
