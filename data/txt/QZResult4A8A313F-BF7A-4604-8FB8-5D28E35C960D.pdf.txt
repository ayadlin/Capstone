Abstract
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by a profound deregulation of the mechanisms controlling
cell-cycle progression and survival. We herein show that the combination of 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) and IFN-a
induces marked antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in MCL cells through the modulation of critical
targets. Particularly, IFN-a enhances RA-mediated G0–G1 cell accumulation by downregulating cyclin D1 and
increasing p27Kip1 and p21WAF1/Cip1 protein levels. Furthermore, RA/IFN-a combination also induces apoptosis by
triggering both caspases-8 and -9 resulting in Bax and Bak activation. In particular, RA/IFN-a treatment
downregulates the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and Bﬂ-1 proteins and upregulates the proapoptotic BH3-only Noxa
protein. Sequestration of Mcl-1 and Bﬂ-1 by upregulated Noxa results in the activation of Bid, and the consequent
induction of apoptosis is inhibited by Noxa silencing. Noxa upregulation is associated with nuclear translocation of
the FOXO3a transcription factor as consequence of RA/IFN-a–induced Akt inhibition. Pharmacologic suppression
of Akt, but not of TORC1, increases Noxa protein levels and downregulates Bﬂ-1 protein supporting the conclusion
that the inhibition of the Akt pathway, the resulting FOXO3a activation and Noxa upregulation are critical
molecular mechanisms underlying RA/IFN-a—dependent MCL cell apoptosis. These results support the potential
therapeutic value of RA/IFN-a combination in MCL management. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1825–35. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct CD5þ B-cell non–
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;
q32) translocation that leads to overexpression of cyclin D1
and subsequent cyclin D/Rb pathway deregulation (1, 2).
Nevertheless, other genetic changes, such as c-myc overexpression, loss of the ATM gene, low levels of the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1, and p53 deregulation (3–5), are
probably required for MCL development. Gene expression
proﬁling of MCL cells has recently shown the dysregulation
of several genes/proteins involved in NF-kB, PI3K/Akt, and
mTOR signaling pathways, which are all constitutively activated in MCL cells (6–9). These ﬁndings suggest that a
profound alteration of pathways regulating cell survival is
likely responsible for the aggressive clinical behavior of MCL,

which usually show poor response to conventional therapeutic regimens and a very unfavorable prognosis, even when the
disease is treated with high-dose therapy and hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (1). Therefore, new therapeutic
options need to be explored in patients affected by these
lymphomas.
We have recently shown that 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) induces
marked antiproliferative responses in MCL cells by interfering
with G1–S transition through the inhibition of ubiquitination
and proteasome-dependent degradation of p27Kip1. Retinoic
acid–upregulated p27Kip1 binds to cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes,
resulting in decreased CDK4 kinase activity and pRb hypophosphorylation. Notably, retinoic acid also inhibited the growthpromoting effect induced in primary MCL cells by microenvironmental factors such as CD40 triggering and interleukin
(IL)-4 (10). These ﬁndings make these compounds highly
attractive in terms of potential clinical efﬁcacy in this setting.
Because retinoic acid alone does not induce relevant apoptotic
responses in MCLs, we investigated the ability of retinoic acid
to cooperate with IFNs in inducing apoptosis in MCL cells.
Indeed, RA/IFN combination was previously shown to exert
synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in different cancer cell systems (11, 12). With particular regard to the
proapoptotic activity, these compounds can variably promote
both the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (12, 13), often overexpressed in B-NHLs,
including MCL (14–18) and/or the induction of proapoptotic
proteins, including Bax, Noxa, and XAF1 (12, 19–23).

Intriguingly, recent studies showed a critical role of Noxa/Mcl1 interaction in regulating MCL cell survival. In fact, both
Noxa-upregulating and BH3-mimetic drugs were shown to
induce signiﬁcant apoptotic responses in MCL (24–26). Noxa
belongs to the BH3-only subfamily of proteins with proapoptotic activity (27), which may directly or indirectly
promote Bax and Bak activation. A crucial event in this
process is the selective interaction with and the consequent
inactivation of the prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family,
which, speciﬁcally for Noxa, are represented by Mcl-1 and
A1/Bﬂ-1 (28).
On these grounds, we have investigated the ability of RA/
IFN-a treatment to induce apoptotic responses in MCL cells
and, particularly, to shift the critical balance between antiand proapoptotic regulators in favor of apoptotic machinery
activation. Moreover, taking into account our previous ﬁndings indicating that the PI3K/Akt pathway is critical for MCL
cell survival and that Akt, but not mTOR, inhibition induces
apoptotic responses in MCL (9), we also investigated the
effects of RA/IFN-a treatment on the inherent PI3K/Akt
activation.

Proliferation assay, apoptosis, and caspase activity
detection
Cell proliferation was evaluated by 3H-thymidine uptake
(10) and apoptosis by Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI)
stains and/or by active/cleaved caspase-3. Activation of
caspases-8, -9, and -3 was evaluated using a ﬂuorimetric
commercial kit (Immunochemistry Technologies). All ﬂow
cytometric analyses were conducted on a FC500 ﬂow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
Antibodies and reagents
Bcl-2 antibody was from Calbiochem; Bcl-xL, A1/Bﬂ-1, Mcl1, Bax, Bid (rabbit), Puma, phospho-Akt (Ser473), phosphoS6rp (Ser235/236), phospho-GSK-3a/b (S21/9), phosphoFOXO3a (S318/321), Akt, and active caspase-3 (D175) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology; Noxa, Mcl-1 (Y37),
Bcl-2A1 (EP517Y) antibodies were from Abcam; p27Kip1 and
p21Waf1 from BD Transduction Laboratories; PARP (F2), cyclin
D1 (DCS-6), p57Kip2, p45Skp2, and Cks1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Bid (mouse) antibody from SouthernBiotech; and
Bak (NT) and FOXO3a antibodies from Millipore. Vital nuclear
dye DRAQ5, SH5 (Akt inhibitor), and LY294002 were purchased
from Alexis Biochemicals; rapamycin, G418, 9-cis-RA (Sigma);
and IFN-a (IntronA, SP Europe) were used at 1 mmol/L and
1,000 U/mL, respectively. RO 40-6055 (RARa agonist) was
kindly provided by Dr. W. Bollag (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc.)
and SR11237 (RXR agonist) was a kind gift of Dr. H. Gronemeyer (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et
Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France).

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
Four patients with MCL were identiﬁed on the basis of
morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular criteria
according to World Health Organization (WHO) lymphoma
classiﬁcation (Table 1). The study was conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the local Institutional
Review Board, and all patients gave their informed consent.
Mononuclear cells were isolated from unicellular suspension
obtained from mechanically minced lymph nodes or spleen.
Enriched MCL samples (>70% MCL) were cryopreserved in
10% dimethyl sulfoxide until further study. Before use, samples
were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza) containing
10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics.

Extracts preparation, immunoprecipitation,
and immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysate extracts and immunoprecipitated samples
were prepared as previously described (10). Proteins were
fractionated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was conducted using the
Enhanced Chemiluminescence plus Detection System
(PerkinElmer).

Cell lines
Mino, SP53, and Jeko-1 cell lines were generously contributed by Dr. Raymond Lai, University of Alberta and Cross
Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Granta-519 was
purchased from DSMZ (29). Cell lines were authenticated by
ﬁngerprinting (Power Plex 1.2, Promega) in January 2011. Cells
were cultured as previously described (10).

Intracellular ﬂow cytometry
Cells (106) were ﬁxed with 2% of paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 500 mL of cold methanol, and incubated
with the primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
After 2 washes with PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells
were incubated for 30 minutes in ice with phycoerythrin

and the infection efﬁciency was checked by ﬂow cytometry

Bid–Mcl-1 and Bid–A1/Bﬂ-1 colocalization and FOXO3a
nuclear internalization
Cells (106 per sample) were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and labeled
as described above. Samples were acquired with the ImageStream X (Amnis) using the INSPIRE software. For colocalization experiments, samples were labeled with Mcl-1 or A1/Bﬂ-1
antibodies and Bid antibody and DRAQ5. Then, cells doublepositive for Mcl-1 and Bid or A1/Bﬂ-1 and Bid were selected
and compared using an algorithm of the IDEAS software which
calculates the speciﬁcity and the degree of the ﬂuorescence
signals colocalization through the Similarity Bright Details
Score (SBDS; see Supplementary Methods; ref. 30). For the
analysis of FOXO3a nuclear internalization, samples were
labeled with an antibody against FOXO3a (1:100) at 4 C
overnight. Then, cells were stained with the PE-anti-rabbit
secondary antibody and DRAQ5. Using an algorithm of the
IDEAS software, the similarity score (SS; ref. 31) between
FOXO3a and DRAQ5 staining was calculated for each sample.

Results
IFN-a signiﬁcantly enhances the antiproliferative
activity exerted by retinoic acid in MCL cells
The 9-cis-RA is the isomer with the strongest antiproliferative activity against MCL cells (10). Treatment of SP53 cells
with 9-cis-RA (1 mmol/L) in combination with IFN-a (1,000 U/
mL) for 2, 4, and 7 days resulted in a more pronounced
inhibition of MCL cell proliferation as compared with cells
treated with retinoic acid alone, showing an additive effect (Fig.
1A). Consistently, 9-cis-RA/IFN-a combination increased the
number of MCL cells in G0–G1 (not shown), suggesting a likely
involvement of regulators of G1 to S-phase transition. Immunoblotting analysis showed that IFN-a enhances the upregulation of the p27Kip1 protein induced by 9-cis-RA as a result of a
more pronounced inhibition of p45Skp2 and Cks1, 2 SCFSkp2

Noxa silencing
Two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) PMAIP1 (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate–induced protein 1) constructs
were obtained by subcloning the double-stranded 64-mer
oligonucleotide containing the PMAIP1 target sequences (A:

9-cis-RA sensitizes MCL cells to the proapoptotic effect
of IFN-a through both RARa and RXRs
We previously showed that retinoic acid alone does not
induce relevant apoptotic responses in MCL (10). Given the
ability of IFN-a to cooperate with retinoic acid in inhibiting
MCL cell growth, we also explored the possible induction of
proapoptotic effects. To this end, SP53 and Mino cells were
treated with each drug alone or in combination for 3 and 5 days,
and apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin-V/PI staining. RA/
IFN-a combination induced more pronounced apoptotic
effects in both MCL cell lines than single treatments (Fig.
2A). In particular, sequential treatment experiments indicated
that a 24-hour pretreatment with 9-cis-RA sensitizes MCL cells
to the proapoptotic effect of IFN-a, whereas the reverse

complex components that are required for proteasome-dependent p27Kip1 degradation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, 9-cis-RA/IFNa combination also induces p21WAF1/Cip1 upregulation, whereas the levels of p57Kip2 were unaffected (Fig. 1B). Notably,
p21WAF1/Cip1 upregulation was detected in MCL cell lines with
either wild-type p53 (Granta-519, SP53) or mutated p53 (Jeko-1,
Mino), excluding a p53-only–dependent effect (Fig. 1C). Quantitative real-time PCR experiments showed no or low effects on
the mRNA levels of the factors studied (Supplementary Fig. S1),
consistent with a mainly posttranslational modulation
induced by the treatment. More interestingly, after 5 days of
9-cis-RA/IFN-a treatment, SP53 and Mino cells showed a
marked downregulation of cyclin D1 protein levels, an effect
that was not observed in cells exposed to each drug alone (Fig.
1D). These ﬁndings indicate that IFN-a enhances the antiproliferative activity exerted by retinoic acid in MCL cells by
decreasing the protein levels of cyclin D1 and further upregulating p27Kip1 and p21WAF1/Cip1.

induced only modest effects (Fig. 2B). Considering that the
pleiotropic effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by 2 classes
of nuclear receptors, the RARs and RXRs (33, 34), and that 9-cisRA is a pan-RAR and -RXR agonist, the relative contribution of
distinct retinoic receptors was assessed using synthetic selective agonists for RARa (RO 40-6055) and RXR (SR11237). As
shown in Fig. 2C, both RARa and RXR agonists sensitize MCL
cells to IFN-a—induced apoptosis, although the relative contribution of RARa is markedly higher. These ﬁndings are
clinically relevant, as RARa agonists are associated with less
pronounced side effects than the pan-RAR/RXR agonist 9-cisRA when used in vivo.
9-cis-RA/IFN-a–dependent MCL cell apoptosis involves
multiple caspase activation and modulation of anti- and
proapoptotic proteins
The involvement of initiator and effectors caspases in
9-cis-RA/IFN-a–induced apoptosis was investigated in SP53
and Mino cells using speciﬁc ﬂuorimetric caspase assays.
Time course experiments showed that both caspases-8 and
-9 are activated, almost simultaneously, after 36 hours of
9-cis-RA/IFN-a treatment; nevertheless, at later time points,
their activity differs (Fig. 3A). In fact, caspase-8 activation
increases progressively, whereas the caspase-9 activity, after
the initial triggering, increases more slowly, showing a
downmodulation at 60 hours and a subsequent increase
at 72 hours (Fig. 3A). Given the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway, the role of Bak and Bax proteins was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using antibodies speciﬁc for the
N-terminal domains of these proteins that are exposed only
upon Bak and Bax activation. As shown in Fig. 3B, the
conformational changes of Bak and Bax were detectable
only in cells exposed to 9-cis-RA/IFN-a (3 and 5 days)

Given that the interactions between pro- and antiapoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 superfamily are essential for mitochondrial integrity, the expression levels of several proteins of the
Bcl-2 and BH3-only families were analyzed by immunoblotting
in SP53 cells treated with 9-cis-RA, IFN-a, or their combination.
While no change in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression levels was
observed in the different conditions, a marked downregulation
of the Bcl-xL and A1/Bﬂ-1 antiapoptotic proteins was induced
by 9-cis-RA/IFN-a (Fig. 3C). Although this treatment induced
conformational changes indicating Bax and Bak activation, the
expression levels of these proteins in untreated and treated
cells were comparable. Analysis of BH3-only proteins disclosed
a marked increase of Noxa protein levels, especially in 9-cis-RA/
IFN-a–treated cells, whereas the expression of Puma did not
appreciably change. The levels of the full-length Bid protein
decreased signiﬁcantly as likely consequence of its activation
by caspase-dependent cleavage (Fig. 3C). Notably, 9-cis-RA/

IFN-a treatment was also able to signiﬁcantly upregulate Noxa
concomitantly with enhanced caspase-3 activation in all 4
primary MCL cultures investigated (Fig. 3D). This effect was
apparently speciﬁc for lymphoma cells, as 9-cis-RA/IFN-a did
not upregulate Noxa, nor exerted any proapoptotic activity in
normal B lymphocytes obtained from 2 different donors (not
shown). Taken together, these results indicate that 9-cis-RA/
IFN-a combination triggers both mitochondrial/intrinsic and
death receptor/extrinsic apoptotic pathways and promotes the
shift of the critical balance between anti- and proapoptotic
proteins in favor of apoptotic machinery activation.
Noxa is a critical mediator of 9-cis-RA/IFN-a–induced
apoptosis
The BH3-only protein Noxa was shown to be one of the
critical players of the apoptotic responses induced in MCL cells
by different drugs, such as bortezomib and the MDM2 inhibitor
Nutlin-3 (24, 25). Interestingly, immunoblotting experiments
showed that Noxa upregulation was induced by 9-cis-RA and at

Figure 4. A, Noxa knockdown reduces RA/IFN-a–dependent apoptosis. Mino cells infected with empty vector (pSUPER) and 2 different clones (CL.a and CL.b)
of cells infected with vector containing shPMAIP1 sequence A and 1 clone (CL.c) with the sequence B (see Materials and Methods) were treated with 9-cis-RA/
IFN-a for 3 days. Total cell lysates (50 mg) were analyzed by immunoblotting for Noxa, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. B, RA/IFN-a combination promotes the
formation of Noxa–Mcl-1 and Noxa–A1/Bﬂ-1 complexes. SP53 cells were cultured in absence or presence of 9-cis-RA/IFN-a for 3 days. Mcl-1 (left) and A1/
Bﬂ-1 (right) were immunoprecipitated from 500 mg of total proteins. Immunoprecipitated (IP; bound) and nonimmunoprecipitated (unbound) fractions were
analyzed by immunoblotting for Noxa, Mcl-1, and A1/Bﬂ-1 proteins. C, RA/IFN-a–induced Noxa favors Bid displacement from Bid–Mcl-1 complexes in SP53

higher levels by 9-cis-RA/IFN-a cotreatment. These effects are
probably mediated by transcriptional regulation, as shown by
microarray-based expression proﬁling carried out in SP53 cells
(not shown). To assess the role of Noxa in 9-cis-RA/IFNa–dependent apoptosis, we knocked down Noxa expression
by retrovirally infecting Mino cells with a pSUPER.retro-GFP/

reduces the extent of treatment-dependent apoptosis in Mino
cells assessed by cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4A). Considering the ability of Noxa to speciﬁcally bind and consequently inactivate the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and A1/Bﬂ-1 proteins, the interactions between Noxa and these 2 Bcl-2 family

Effects of RA/a-IFN in Mantle Cell Lymphoma

members were investigated. Most of 9-cis-RA/IFN-a–induced
Noxa co-immunoprecipitated with Mcl-1, the remaining
amount being associated to A1/Bﬂ-1 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
the sequestration of Mcl-1 by upregulated Noxa results in the
displacement of the full-length Bid protein from Bid–Mcl-1
complexes (Fig. 4C), allowing thus the consequent Bid activation through enzyme cleavage. The resulting truncated Bid
may thus directly contribute to the activation of the Bak and
Bax apoptotic effectors. Taking advantage from multispectral
imaging ﬂow cytometry, we analyzed the colocalization
between Bid and Mcl-1 and A1/Bﬂ-1 also in vivo. To this end,
we set up a protocol in which the cells were stained with
speciﬁc antibodies to Mcl-1 or A1/Bﬂ-1 and Bid proteins and
then the Bid–Mcl-1 and Bid–A1/Bﬂ-1 colocalization was analyzed only in double-positive live cells. As shown in Fig. 4D and
E, the SBDS detected in untreated samples was 2.48  0.42 for
Bid-Mcl-1 and 2.45  0.49 for Bid-A1/Bﬂ-1, and in both cases,
the score signiﬁcantly decreased when the cells were treated
for 3 days with RA/IFN-a. Moreover, in treated samples, the
percentage of cells showing a signiﬁcant colocalization of the 2
proteins (with SBDS  2.25) was reduced from 72% to 19.2% for
Bid–Mcl-1 and from 66.4% to 17.2% for Bid–A1/Bﬂ-1. These
results indicate that the treatment induces the displacement of
Bid from Bid–Mcl-1 and Bid–A1/Bﬂ-1 complexes through
Noxa upregulation and this event precedes and promotes the
apoptotic process.
9-cis-RA/IFN-a–dependent MCL cell apoptosis is
mediated by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway
We and others recently showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway is
constitutively activated in MCL, resulting in a strong deregulation of both cell proliferation and survival (8, 9). Particularly,
pharmacologic inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
or Akt induced signiﬁcant levels of apoptosis in both established cell lines and primary MCL cultures, whereas the TORC1
inhibitor rapamycin induced no or only modest effects on cell
survival (9). On these grounds, we investigated the ability of 9cis-RA/IFN-a to interfere with the constitutive activation of
these kinases. In particular, SP53 cells were treated for 3 days
with 9-cis-RA, IFN-a, or their combination and analyzed for the
presence of the phosphorylated form of Akt and of its substrates GSK-3b and FOXO3a. In addition, TORC1 activation
was investigated by analyzing the phosphorylation status of
one of its main substrates, the S6 ribosomal protein. Interestingly, 9-cis-RA inhibited Akt and mTOR activation, as shown by
the downregulation of phospho-(S473)-Akt, of its substrates
phospho-(Ser21)-GSK-3b and phospho-(Ser318/321)-FOXO3a,
and of phospho-(S235/236)-S6RP, and more importantly, IFNa signiﬁcantly enhanced the inhibitory effects exerted by
retinoic acid on these kinases (Fig. 5A). In particular, 9-cisRA/IFN-a–induced Akt inhibition was associated with Noxa
upregulation and the decrease of A1/Bﬂ-1 protein levels (Fig.
5B). Furthermore, the PI3k/Akt inhibitor LY294002 induced a
marked upregulation of Noxa and a complete depletion of A1/
Bﬂ-1, whereas rapamycin did not affect the levels of these
proteins (Fig. 5C), consistent with our previous demonstration
that rapamycin is unable to induce apoptosis in MCL cells (9).
Notably, Noxa upregulation induced by the treatment was

www.aacrjournals.org

observed in MCL cell lines carrying either wild-type (SP53) or
mutant p53 (Jeko-1; Fig. 5B), supporting the hypothesis that a
different transcription factor is involved in this phenomenon.
Interestingly, FOXO3a activates the transcription of several
genes, including PMAIP1, which encodes for the Noxa protein
(35). FOXO3a transcriptional activity is regulated by the control of its intracellular localization through the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of different serine/threonine residues.
In particular, Akt-dependent phosphorylation on Thr32, Ser
318/321, and Ser253 abolishes its nuclear translocation. Given
the ability of 9-cis-RA/IFN-a to inhibit Akt-dependent FOXO3a
phosphorylation, using multispectral imaging ﬂow cytometry,
we evaluated FOXO3a intracellular localization after 48 hours
of exposure to 9-cis-RA/IFN-a, SH5 (10 mmol/L), or rapamycin
(0.1 mmol/L). As shown in Fig. 5D, FOXO3a protein is clearly
retained in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, whereas in 9-cisRA/IFN-a- and SH5-treated cells, the protein is also detectable
within the nucleus in 58.7% and 64.1% of cells, respectively. In
contrast, rapamycin did not affect FOXO3a intracellular localization, conﬁrming that this transcription factor is Akt- but not
TORC1-dependent. Notably, the analyses were conducted
excluding apoptotic cells, given that FOXO3a nuclear internalization and consequent Noxa upregulation are 2 events occurring in the ﬁrst steps of the apoptotic process. These results are
consistent with a role of FOXO3a as a molecular mediator of
the 9-cis-RA/IFN-a–induced Noxa upregulation. Moreover,
these ﬁndings indicate that the 9-cis-RA/IFN-a combination
induces MCL cell apoptosis through inhibition of the inherent
Akt activation, and the consequent increment of FOXO3a
activity and, in turn, of Noxa expression (Fig. 6A and B).

Discussion
As our understanding of the biology of MCL advances, novel
agents rationally designed to target the key pathogenic
mechanisms of MCL, such as cyclin D1, cyclin/CDK inhibitors,
proapoptotic proteins, mTOR, and proteasome, continue to
emerge. Previously, we showed that the constitutive PI3K/Akt/
mTOR activation contributes to the stability of cyclin D1 and
p27Kip1 in MCL cells (9, 36), suggesting that this signaling
pathway may be a crucial therapeutic target. While the therapeutic potential of TORC1 inhibitors is being extensively
studied in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (37),
speciﬁc inhibitors of the upstream kinase Akt are still under
evaluation in phase I clinical trials (38). Nevertheless, the Akt
kinase may constitute a more effective target in MCL than
TORC1, as Akt inhibition not only reduces proliferation but
also induces signiﬁcant apoptotic responses (9).
Herein, we show that RA/IFN-a cotreatment has signiﬁcant
effects on both proliferation and cell survival by affecting key
molecular targets of MCL, such as cyclin D1, p27Kip1, Akt, and
Noxa (Fig. 6A and B). In particular, IFN-a enhances the antiproliferative activity exerted by 9-cis-RA by inducing a downregulation of cyclin D1, which is strongly overexpressed in most
MCLs. Nevertheless, the observation that cyclin D1 overexpression alone is not sufﬁcient for MCL development and that its
downregulation has only limited effects on MCL cell proliferation and survival (39) indicates that additional targets should

be affected to obtain clinically relevant therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Intriguingly, the antiproliferative activity of RA/IFN-a involves
also the increased expression of the p27Kip1 and p21WAF1/Cip1
cell-cycle inhibitors as a consequence of enhanced protein
stability. This is particularly relevant for the p27Kip1 protein,
which shows an abnormally short half-life in most of MCLs
(5). Furthermore, p21WAF1/Cip1 upregulation is induced irrespective of the p53 mutational status of the cells, thus excluding a p53-only–dependent effect and suggesting that this drug
combination could be efﬁcient also in cases showing deregulations in this critical pathway. This is particularly intriguing
in the light of the observation that about 25% of MCLs shows
a deregulated p53 (40, 41), a characteristic that could promote
the resistance to novel drugs targeting the HDM2/p53
pathway, such as the MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3 (25) and
MI-63 (42).

More relevant in a therapeutic perspective is the demonstration that, unlike retinoic acid alone (10), the RA/IFN-a
combination induces signiﬁcant levels of apoptosis in both
established cell lines and primary MCL cultures. The exposure
of MCL cells to 9-cis-RA for 24 hours and the following addition
of IFN-a indicate this sequential treatment as the most effective combination, providing thus the rationale for the design of
appropriate treatment schedules. Moreover, we also show that
9-cis-RA ability to sensitize MCL cells to IFN-a–dependent
proapoptotic effect involves both RARa and RXRs. These
ﬁndings are of potential clinical relevance, as RARa agonists
are associated with less pronounced side effects than the panRAR/RXR agonist 9-cis-RA when used in vivo. RA/IFN-a combination triggers both the death receptor/extrinsic and the
mitochondrial/intrinsic apoptotic pathways and promotes the
activation of the proapoptotic effectors Bak and Bax.

Moreover, RA/IFN-a treatment induced upregulation of Noxa
and the concomitant Mcl-1 and A1/Bﬂ-1 inactivation as a
result of protein–protein interactions. (24–26). In contrast to
other compounds inducing Noxa-dependent MCL cell apoptosis, RA/IFN-a combination does not increase Mcl-1 protein
levels and even downregulates A1/Bﬂ-1. Intriguingly, our
results show that, under normal conditions, both Mcl-1 and
A1/Bﬂ-1 can be bound to the full-length form of Bid, thus
preventing its cleavage and repressing its activation. MCL cell
exposure to RA/IFN-a combination relieves this repression
through a competitive inhibition exerted by Noxa, which favors
Bid displacement from pro/antiapoptotic protein complexes
and its subsequent activation.
Notably, we took advantage of multispectral imaging ﬂow
cytometry to selectively analyze Bid–Mcl-1 and Bid–A1/Bﬂ-1
colocalization in cells with morphometric features of early

apoptosis, a distinction that is not usually feasible in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This methodologic approach is
particularly relevant if we consider that the binding of Mcl-1 or
A1/Bﬂ-1 to Bid abolishes its proapoptotic activity and that RA/
IFN-a–induced Bid displacement from these complexes is an
early event in the activation of apoptotic machinery.
Noxa was initially identiﬁed as transcriptional target of p53
(43), but now it is well known that it could be induced also by
other factors, as it occurs in neuronal cells where it is induced
by the activation of the FOXO3a transcription factor, a downstream target of the Akt kinase (35). We previously showed that
the PI3K/Akt pathway is crucial for MCL cell survival and that
the inhibition of Akt, but not of TORC1, induced apoptosis in
MCL cells, suggesting that an Akt substrate different from
TORC1 is likely involved in mediating these effects. The results
presented herein support the conclusion that the inhibition of

the Akt pathway by RA/IFN-a, resulting in FOXO3a dephosphorylation/activation and its subsequent nuclear internalization followed by Noxa upregulation, is one of the main
molecular mechanisms underlying RA/IFN-a–dependent MCL
cell death.
Our ﬁndings are also consistent with a relevant role of RA/
IFN-a–induced Akt inhibition in mediating MCL cell growth
inhibition (9, 36). In particular, this drug combination mimics
the effects induced in MCL cells by pharmacologic inhibition of
Akt, which results in cyclin D1 downregulation and p27Kip1
overexpression.
Overall, the results of the present study show that how
the combination 9-cis-RA/IFN-a affects critical molecular
targets of MCL, thus providing a strong rationale for the clinical
application of known and relatively cheap drugs in the management of this aggressive and poorly responsive lymphoma.
