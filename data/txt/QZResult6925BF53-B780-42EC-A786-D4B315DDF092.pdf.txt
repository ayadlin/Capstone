BACKGROUND: Data suggest that weight, and specifically body mass index (BMI), plays a role in breast cancer development and
outcome. The authors hypothesized that there would be a correlation between BMI and clinical outcome in patients with early stage,
human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer enrolled in the N9831 adjuvant trial. METHODS: Patients were grouped
according to baseline BMI as follows: normal (BMI <25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI 30
kg/m2). Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between treatment arms A, B, and C
(chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab) were performed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Analysis
was completed on 3017 eligible patients. Obese patients were more likely to be older and postmenopausal (P <.0001 for both), to
have larger tumors (P 5.002), and to have positive lymph nodes (P 5.004). In the pooled analysis cohort, differences in DFS among
the BMI groups were statistically significant (5-year DFS rate: 82.5%, 78.6%, and 78.5% for normal weight, overweight, and obese
women, respectively; log-rank P 5.02). The adjusted hazard ratio comparing the DFS of overweight women with the DFS of normal
women was 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.61); and, comparing the DFS of obese women with the DFS normal women, the
adjusted hazard ratio was 1.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.59). There were no statistically significant differences in DFS by weight
group for women within any trial arm. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer and normal BMI had a
better 5-year DFS compared with overweight and obese women. The current results indicated that adjuvant trastuzumab improves

INTRODUCTION
Obesity, as defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 according to the World Health Organization, is a significant
public health issue and has been associated with increased death rates for essentially all cancers, including breast cancer.1-3
Previous studies also have demonstrated that obesity (high BMI) is a risk factor for the development of new cases of breast
cancer and also negatively affects disease-free survival (DFS) after a diagnosis of this disease.4-9 Previous studies have indicated that obese patients, compared with nonobese patients, tend to be older, have larger tumor size, and have increased
levels of axillary lymph node involvement.10,11In view of the established relation between estrogen levels and obesity, most
studies have examined the correlation of DFS with BMI and hormone receptor status; positive estrogen receptor (ER) status; endocrine therapy; and, most, recently triple-negative breast cancer.7-9,12-15 These studies have demonstrated that,
among postmenopausal women, an increased BMI is associated with ER-positive/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive status and an increased risk (up to 33%) of breast cancer.8,9 However, data on newer, specific subtypes of breast cancer, such
as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive disease, are not available. HER2-positive breast cancer, defined as
protein overexpression or gene amplification, affects approximately 15% to 20% of patients who have invasive breast cancer.16 Moreover, a potential impact of BMI on the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab had not been reported, which
prompted our study; we hypothesized that this may be particularly relevant, based on the cross-signaling pathways
between HER2 and other metabolic pathways, such as the estrogen and insulin growth factor pathways.17
Our group has conducted a large adjuvant trial (North Central Cancer Treatment Group, now part of the
Alliance for Trials in Clinical Oncology]; trial N9831), which enrolled more than 3500 patients who had a diagnosis of

HER2-positive, early stage breast cancer, allowing us the
opportunity to explore correlations patient outcomes with
BMI, HER2-positive breast cancer, and chemotherapy with
or without trastuzumab. Our independent N9831 trial, the
joint efficacy analysis of the N9831 trial with the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project B-31 clinical trial, as well
as other well conducted trials, demonstrated that adding
trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy significantly
improved DFS and overall survival in the overall group of
patients with HER2-positive, early stage breast cancer and
provided the basis for an analysis of the potential impact of
BMI on various pathologic and outcome parameters.18-21
This report presents baseline BMI and its relation to tumor
characteristics and DFS in patients who received either
chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy with trastuzumab on
the N9831 adjuvant clinical/translational trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The randomized phase 3 North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831 enrolled 3505 women aged 18
years with primary, operable, lymph node-positive or
high-risk lymph node-negative, HER2 positive adenocarcinoma of the breast who were eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy.18,19 All tumors were required to be HER2positive by either fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) demonstrating gene amplification (2.0 ratio) or
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay indicating a strongly
positive score (31; 10% of cells with circumferential
membrane staining). Complete resection of the primary
tumor and axillary-node evaluation were required. All
patients gave written, informed consent.
Eligible patients enrolled in the N9831 trial were
assigned randomly to 1 of 3 arms. In arm A (the control
arm), patients received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
(AC) (60/600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks 3 4) followed by paclitaxel (P) (80 mg/m2 weekly 3 12); in arm B (the sequential
arm), patients received similar AC, followed by paclitaxel,
and then followed by trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose,
then 2 mg/kg for 52 weeks); and, in arm C (the concurrent
arm), patients received AC followed by paclitaxel concurrently with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, then 2 mg/
kg for 11 weeks) followed by trastuzumab alone (2 mg/kg
for an additional 40 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, all patients received radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy as clinically indicated.18,19
Methods

BMI (defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of the height in meters [kg/m2]) was calculated from base2448

line body surface area (BSA) and weight obtained from the
baseline case report forms, whereas height was not
recorded. The formula used to compute BMI from BSA
and weight was: BMI 5 (weight3)/(1296 3 BSA4).20 Each
study site used their own method to determine the BSA of
each woman as reported on the baseline case report form,
from which we calculated the BMI.
Statistical Analyses

The primary analysis of the report herein was to define
whether DFS differed according to BMI and whether
there was a treatment-by-BMI interaction. The primary
analysis categorized BMI as normal weight (BMI <25 kg/
m2), overweight (25 BMI <30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI
30 kg/m2). A second analysis was performed that treated
BMI as a continuous variable.
DFS, the primary endpoint, was defined as the time
from registration to the first disease-related event. A disease-related event was a local, regional, or distant breast
cancer recurrence; contralateral breast cancer; a new primary cancer (except squamous or basal cell carcinoma of
the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast); or death from any cause.18
DFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and
DFS curves among different groups were compared using
the log-rank test. Comparisons were made of DFS among
BMI groups for women pooled across the 3 treatment
arms and within each treatment arm.
Patients were grouped according to BMI status
based on their baseline BMI value. Categorical variables
between groups (eg normal vs overweight vs obese) were
compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables
were compared between groups with a 2-sample t test. A
stratified Cox proportional hazards analysis, stratified by
hormone receptor status and lymph node status and
adjusted for race and age, was used to generate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition to determining the effect of treatment and BMI status
on DFS, a Cox model was used to assess the potential
interaction between treatment arm and BMI status.
A secondary analysis was performed using breast-cancer
specific survival (BCSS) as an endpoint. An event was defined
as a death from breast cancer, and deaths from other causes
were censored. A two-sided P value < .05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
There were 3505 women enrolled on the N9831 trial, and
the current investigation was performed on an analysis

likely to have breast cancer lymph node involvement compared with obese women. A greater proportion of obese
women had hormone receptor-positive disease compared
with overweight and normal weight women, but this difference was not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences were observed in predominant tumor
histology or histologic tumor grade among the normal
weight, overweight, and obese groups.

among the 3 groups were not significant. The proportions
of normal weight, overweight, and obese women did not
differ across treatment groups (P 5 .86).
Body Mass Index and Survival

There were 647 disease-related events in the analysis
cohort of 3017 women. At the time of analysis, 360
women in the analysis cohort had died, including 292
deaths from breast cancer. The median follow-up for
women who remained disease-free was 5.3 years.
In the pooled analysis cohort (ie, pooling patients
across the 3 treatment arms), the difference in DFS among
normal weight, overweight, and obese women was statistically significant (Table 3, Fig. 1): the adjusted HR comparing the DFS of overweight women with the DFS of normal
weight women was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06-1.61), and the
adjusted HR comparing the DFS of obese women with the
DFS of normal weight women was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.071.59). The 5-year DFS rates were 82.5%, 78.6%, and
78.5% for normal weight, overweight, and obese women,
respectively. However, the DFS did not appear to differ significantly between overweight and obese women for the
pooled cohort.
The effect of treatment did not statistically differ
according to BMI classified as normal, overweight, and
obese. The treatment arm, by obesity status interaction
terms, was not significant, although this analysis was
underpowered. Table 3 contains a summary of the DFS
for the 3 BMI groups within each treatment arm; and Figure 2 displays the DFS according to the BMI groups
within each treatment arm: the control group, which did
not receive trastuzumab (arm A), the group that received
sequential trastuzumab (arm B), and the group that
received concurrent trastuzumab (arm C). It appears that
normal weight women had a better DFS experience than
2450

overweight and obese women in the control arm (Fig. 2,
top) and in the sequential trastuzumab arm (Fig. 2, middle), although the differences among the 3 groups were
not statistically significant. It is noteworthy that there
does not appear to be a difference in the DFS experience
among the 3 BMI groups on the concurrent trastuzumab
arm (Fig. 2, bottom); in particular, the normal weight
women did not appear to have a better DFS than the other
2 groups.
We also analyzed BMI as a continuous variable
(results not shown). All BMI-by-treatment variable interaction terms, again, were nonsignificant.
The conclusions were similar for the BCSS analysis.
In the pooled analysis, there were differences among the 3
BMI groups, but these were not statistically significant:
the 5-year BCSS rates were 93%, 91.3%, and 91.3% for
normal weight, overweight, and obese women, respectively (P 5 .13). The effect of treatment did not differ by
BMI group, the treatment arm-by-BMI group interaction
terms were not statistically significant. The survival curves
of the 3 BMI groups for each treatment arm appear similar to those illustrated in Figure 2 (data not shown). The
differences in BCSS for the BMI groups within each arm
were not statistically significant (P 5 .29 for arm A;
P 5 .11 for arm B; and P 5 .67 for arm C).
DISCUSSION
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to specifically investigate the relation of BMI with the HER2-positive biologic subtype of early stage breast cancer and its
association with adjuvant therapy, including trastuzumab.
Our data from the N9831 study demonstrated an association between BMI, certain breast cancer features, and clinical outcome. With regard to breast cancer features,

normal and overweight women were more likely to have

there was a trend (although not statistically significant) for
a greater proportion of obese women to have hormone reCancer

ceptor-negative disease compared with nonobese women,
which was a somewhat surprising finding compared with
what we had expected.
Regarding the analysis of BMI and clinical outcome,
our study demonstrated that, when taking into account all
patients across the 3 treatment arms, there was a statistically significant correlation between rising BMI and worse
clinical outcome in patients who had early stage, HER2positive breast cancer. In this overall study population,
those patients who had normal BMI had a better 5-year
DFS compared with overweight and obese women
(82.5% vs 78.5%). Considering that overweight and
obese patients in this cohort were more likely to be postmenopausal, these results are similar to the experience
reported by many national and international groups, especially in women with early stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.4,22,23
We also analyzed the relation of BMI with the type
of adjuvant therapy received. One of the major weaknesses
of this study is that it is underpowered to detect small statistical differences between the 3 different treatment arms,
their interaction with the 3 BMI groups, and their respective clinical outcome. Although the results did not reach
statistical significance, we note that, for the patients who
did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab (arm A), normal
weight women had better DFS experience than

overweight and obese women. Such differences were no
longer noted in the concurrent trastuzumab arm (C). Despite the caveats previously mentioned, this probably represents an important finding of this study: that adjuvant
trastuzumab appears to improve the clinical outcome of
all patients regardless of their BMI. Although DFS may
have been unduly affected by comorbidities and new
events, the finding that the addition of trastuzumab
seemed to negate much of the impact of obesity argues
that this is not the case and that there is some real interaction between BMI and breast cancer outcomes.
Sparano et al recently evaluated the correlation
between BMI and outcomes in 6885 patients enrolled in
3 adjuvant trials coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (E1199, E5188, and E3189).12 When
obesity was evaluated as a categorical variable, it was associated with inferior DFS (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46;
P 5 .0008) and OS (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.67;
P 5 .002) in hormone receptor-positive disease, but not
in other subtypes (HER2-positive or triple-negative).
However, the difference in outcome may have been
caused by the smaller sample size (n 5 940), because only
patients from the E1199 trial underwent routine HER2
testing, and the multivariate analysis for an interaction of
BMI and clinical outcome (DFS, OS, and BCSS) was analyzed only in the context of obese patients (BMI 30 kg/
m2; n 5 302) versus nonobese patients (BMI <30 kg/m2;
n 5 597). We also found statistical significance was lost
when the analysis did not take into account the 3 different
BMI subgroups (data not shown).
The exact biologic cause-effect relation between
increased BMI and the risk of developing breast cancer,
tumor characteristics, and risk of disease recurrence in
patients with early stage breast cancer in HER2-positive
and other subtypes of breast cancer is a matter requiring
additional studies. Several hypotheses to explain the relation of BMI etiology with breast cancer incidence and
characteristics have been brought forth, including sex steroids, insulin levels, insulin-like growth factors and their
downstream Ras and microtubule-associated protein kinase pathways, adipokines, hypoxia, genetic susceptibility,
migrating adipose stem cells, and leptin, among
others.22,24-30 It has also been hypothesized that increased
concentrations of circulating estrogen may contribute to
these differences, partially because of the peripheral aromatization of androstenedione to estrogen in adipose tissue.26,31 The increased concentration of circulating
estrogens also may be caused by lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin in obese, postmenopausal
women.27 Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor
Cancer

(IGFR) signaling is involved in the growth and resistance
to therapy of breast cancer cells. Expression of IGFR has
been correlated with obesity, and increased IGF-binding
protein 3 expression has been correlated with increasing
BMI.24,28 IGF also plays an important role in signaling
with HER2 with cross-talk between IGFR and HER2
present in trastuzumab resistant cells.32 Leptin and its
associated receptor are overexpressed in breast cancer, are
involved in cross-talk with the HER2 pathway, and have
been associated with obesity and worse outcomes.22,29,33
Future studies to expand the literature regarding the effect
of weight reduction toward normal BMI (and influence
pathways that may impact cellular effects of obesity, such
as insulin and exercise) for patients diagnosed with breast
cancer (and other cancers) while obese deserve significant
priority.22,34,35
Putting our data into clinical perspective, we
observed that adjuvant trastuzumab led to an improvement in DFS for all patients, regardless of their BMI, as
indicated in Figures 1 and 2. However, the patients who
had the best clinical outcome were normal weight patients
who were treated with concurrent (arm C) trastuzumab
and chemotherapy (5-year DFS rate, 85.4%), followed by
the other patients in the concurrent trastuzumab treatment arms but grouped as either overweight or obese (5year DFS rate, 85.1% and 82.6%, respectively). It
remains uncertain whether weight loss intervention programs after a breast cancer diagnosis could meaningfully
reduce the risk of recurrence. However, these data support
the concept that having a normal BMI at the time of diagnosis and being treated with concurrent anti-HER2 therapy plus chemotherapy leads to the best long-term
outcome.
