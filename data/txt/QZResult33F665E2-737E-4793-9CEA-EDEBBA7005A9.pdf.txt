Increase of Plasma VEGF after Intravenous Administration
of Bevacizumab Is Predicted by a Pharmacokinetic Model
Marianne O. Stefanini1, Florence T. H. Wu1, Feilim Mac Gabhann2, and Aleksander S. Popel1

Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent cytokines targeted in antiangiogenic
therapies. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF, is being used clinically in
combination with chemotherapy for colorectal, non–small cell lung and breast cancers, and as a single agent for
glioblastoma and is being tested for other types of cancer in numerous clinical trials. It has been reported that
the intravenous injection of bevacizumab leads to an increase of plasma VEGF concentration in cancer patients.
The mechanism responsible for this counterintuitive increase has not been elucidated, although several
hypotheses have been proposed. We use a multiscale systems biology approach to address this problem.
We have constructed a whole-body pharmacokinetic model comprising three compartments: blood, normal
tissue, and tumor tissue. Molecular interactions among VEGF-A family members, their major receptors, the
extracellular matrix, and an anti-VEGF ligand are considered for each compartment. Diffusible molecules
extravasate, intravasate, are removed from the healthy tissue through the lymphatics, and are cleared from the
blood. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9886–94. 2010 AACR.

Major Findings
Our model reproduces the experimentally observed
increase of plasma VEGF following intravenous administration of bevacizumab and predicts this increase to be a
consequence of intercompartmental exchange of VEGF,
the anti-VEGF agent and the VEGF/anti-VEGF complex.
Our results suggest that a fraction of the anti-VEGF drug
extravasates, allowing the agent to bind the interstitial
VEGF. When the complex intravasates (via a combination
of lymphatic drainage and microvascular transport of
macromolecules) and dissociates in the blood, VEGF is
released and the VEGF concentration increases in the
plasma. These results provide a new hypothesis on the
kinetics of VEGF and on the VEGF distribution in the body
caused by antiangiogenic therapies, as well as their
mechanisms of action and could help in designing antiangiogenic therapies.

Introduction
VEGF is a key factor in tumor angiogenesis, and it has
become a major target of antiangiogenic cancer therapy (1). A
large body of evidence suggests that the free plasma VEGF
concentration is elevated several fold in cancer patients
compared to healthy subjects (2). Therapies targeting VEGF
have shown promising results in cancer. Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech Inc.), a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody to VEGF, has demonstrated efficacy in colorectal
cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell
carcinoma, and glioblastoma. The drug has been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these indications
under certain conditions in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and is being tested for other types of cancer and
other conditions in numerous clinical trials.
Despite the growing clinical applications of bevacizumab,
the mechanism of action of this anti-VEGF agent and that of
other anti-VEGF large molecules is not sufficiently understood
(3). Specifically, two important questions remain: whether the
drug acts by sequestering VEGF in the blood, tumor interstitium or both; and whether, as a result, the VEGF concentration in these compartments is reduced to "normal" levels.
Answering these questions would significantly contribute to
understanding the mechanism of action not only at the
molecular level, but also at the levels of tissue, organ, and
whole body and would help in the design of anti-VEGF agents.
Gordon and colleagues reported that the intravenous injection
of bevacizumab led to an increase in serum total VEGF in
clinical trials whereas free VEGF concentration was reduced
(4). Since then, other groups have reported counterintuitive
increases in the plasma VEGF level following bevacizumab

Increased Plasma VEGF Predicted by a Pharmacokinetic Model

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Key Equations
The molecular detailed compartmental model is described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the basis of the
principles of chemical kinetics and biological transport (summarized in Supplement 1). The following example equation describes
the change over time of the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF121 isoform in the interstitial space of the
normal tissue, denoted by the subscript N. The blood compartment is denoted by the subscript B.

The right-hand side terms represent: secretion of VEGF121 isoform (qV121); binding to VEGF121 to its receptors (VEGFR1 and
VEGFR2) and to the complex VEGFR1/NRP1; binding of VEGF121 to the anti-VEGF agent A; and the intercompartmental
transport of VEGF121 by lymphatics (kL) and microvascular permeability to macromolecules (kp). SN,B and KAV,N represent the
total surface of microvessels at the normal tissue/blood interface and the available volume fraction for VEGF121 in the total
volume UN, respectively. The total volumes are denoted by U. The subscript p in Up denotes plasma as distinct from blood.
Note that, with this nomenclature, the ratio Up/UB represents the available fluid volume fraction for VEGF121 in the blood.
The injection of the anti-VEGF agent occurs after establishment of a physiologic steady state (t < 0). At t ¼ 0, the anti-VEGF agent is
administered intravenously at a rate qA for a duration Dtinfusion (typically in minutes). The subscript T represents the tumor. The
equation governing the change of the anti-VEGF agent concentration in the blood over time reads:

where qA ¼ total dose/(n  Dtinfusion) during the duration of each treatment Dtinfusion and qA ¼ 0 for all other times (n ¼ number of
injections). The first two terms on the right-hand side are the intravenous infusion of anti-VEGF at a rate qA and the clearance of antiVEGF from the blood at a rate cA. The next terms represent: drug extravasation; removal of anti-VEGF agent by lymphatics; and drug
intravasation (when the intercompartment transports are included). The last two terms describe the binding of the anti-VEGF agent
to both VEGF isoforms.
As a final example, the change over time of the corresponding VEGF/anti-VEGF concentration in the normal tissue when the
extravasation of the anti-VEGF agent is governed by

and is dependent on: VEGF121 binding to the anti-VEGF agent; and transport of the VEGF/anti-VEGF complex between the
compartments.

Major Assumptions of the Model
Our model does not represent a particular stage or type of cancer to keep the model general in light of the fact that
bevacizumab is administered in primary and metastatic diseases and in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings. Therefore, our tumor
compartment can either be a primary tumor or the aggregate of metastases in tissue.

Because the simulation results for a smaller tumor (half the diameter of the tumor considered in this study) were not
significantly different (both qualitatively and quantitatively-–data not shown), our model does not consider the possible change
in tumor volume that may result from the injection of the anti-VEGF agent for the duration of our simulations.
The degradation of VEGF by proteases is not currently included in the model. Effects of platelets and leukocytes as potential
sites for sequestering VEGF, anti-VEGF, and their products are not considered and should also be added in the future. We assume
that only endothelial cells express VEGF receptors. Our model does not include the presence of receptors on the luminal surface
of endothelial cells and the quantification of abluminal receptors has been estimated from previous studies.
The model does not include multimeric binding of the anti-VEGF or the ability of the anti-VEGF to bind to matrix-bound
VEGF. We assume that the anti-VEGF has a half-life of 21 days. Its complexes formed by the binding of VEGF121 or VEGF165 are
assumed to have the same half-lives because bound and free bevacizumab exhibit the same pharmacokinetic profile. The binding
and unbinding rates of the anti-VEGF to VEGF are taken from the literature to be 9.2  104 (mol/L)1s1 and 2.0  104 s1,
respectively leading to a dissociation constant Kd of 2.2 nM. The above assumptions can be relaxed, if warranted by experimental
data, within the framework of the model that is generally suitable for simulating anti-VEGF therapeutics.

administration (5–7). In the ocular setting, Campa and colleagues reported that intravitreal bevacizumab injection
increased the VEGF concentration in the aqueous humor
(8). Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this
phenomenon. Hsei and colleagues have suggested that the
clearance of complexed VEGF is lower than that of free VEGF
in rats and hypothesized that this lower clearance could
explain the accumulation of total VEGF in serum (9). Other
groups have suggested alternate pathways activated by the
injection of bevacizumab, such as: accumulation of hypoxiainducible factor leading to an increase of VEGF in serum, or
secondary macular edema for the eye (8, 10, 11). Loupakis and
colleagues immunodepleted plasma to remove bevacizumab
and bevacizumab–VEGF complexes and found that plasmafree VEGF was significantly reduced after bevacizumab
administration (12); this methodology helps to circumvent
the problem that the ELISA method used in a number of
studies cannot distinguish between free and total (including
bevacizumab-bound) VEGF. The results of the study corroborate an earlier proposal by Christofanilli and colleagues (13)
that free VEGF can serve as a surrogate marker.
Systems biology approaches, specifically computational and
mathematical modeling, are emerging as powerful tools in
fundamental studies of cancer and design of therapeutics (14,
15). To better understand VEGF distribution in the body, we
have built a three-compartment model composed of normal
(healthy) tissue, blood, and tumor (16). In this study, we have
extended our computational model by including an anti-VEGF
agent delivered by the intravenous infusion (i.e., into the blood
compartment). The model describes the effect of such administration on the VEGF distribution in the blood, normal, and
diseased tissues. Our goal is to understand how the distribution of VEGF, anti-VEGF agent, and their products changes
following the agent administration; in particular, we will
investigate whether the plasma VEGF level increases or
decreases following an intravenous injection of the anti-VEGF
agent.
Even though the results are presented using the parameters for bevacizumab, the model can be applied to other
anti-VEGF agents. One such agent is aflibercept or VEGF
Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.), a soluble humanized VEGF receptor protein designed to bind all VEGF-A

isoforms and placental growth factor (PlGF). This fusion
protein serves as a soluble decoy receptor and is currently in
clinical trials.
Our model includes two VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF121 and
VEGF165), as well as VEGF receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2)
and the coreceptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1). In this study, we
assume that VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and NRP1 are present only on
the abluminal surface of the endothelial cells. The transcapillary microvascular permeability for the diffusible molecules
(VEGF, anti-VEGF, and the VEGF/anti-VEGF complex) is
included, as well as lymphatic drainage from the interstitial
space into the blood compartment. The model equations are
presented in the Supplemental Information (Supplement 1).

Materials and Methods
Most of the parameters for the anti-VEGF agent were taken
from published data on bevacizumab. We assume a half-life of
21 days (4) for the anti-VEGF whether unbound or bound to
VEGF121 or VEGF165, as bound and free bevacizumab exhibit
the same pharmacokinetic profile (9). Kinetic parameters (kon,
koff) for the binding and unbinding of the anti-VEGF to the
vascular endothelial growth factor were taken to be 9.2  104
(mol/L)1s1 and 2.0  104 s1 respectively, leading to a
dissociation constant Kd of 2.2 nM (17).
Experiments have shown that bevacizumab may have multimeric binding to VEGF (9, 18) and can bind to extracellular
matrix-sequestered VEGF (19). For simplicity purposes, we
limit our model to monomeric binding to VEGF and neglect
binding to VEGF sequestered by the extracellular matrix; these
can be included when quantification of binding sites and the
kinetics become available. Bevacizumab has also been
reported to alter the VEGF-dependent microvascular permeability to soluble molecules (20). As a first approximation, we
assume that the geometry of each tissue and the capillary
density remains constant in the course of our simulations, that
is, we do not include tissue remodeling after the injection of
the anti-VEGF agent. Although it may be important, the
inclusion of tissue remodeling would take the model beyond
the scope of this study but could be of interest for further
studies. This model does not include VEGF receptors on the
luminal side of endothelial cells that have not been experi-

mentally characterized, but we have recently shown how such
expression would alter the VEGF distribution (21); we do not
expect that any qualitative conclusions of the study would be
affected by the presence of luminal receptors.
Note that the simulations are not aimed at representing a
particular type or stage of cancer, recognizing that VEGFneutralizing agents may be administered in cases of both
metastatic and primary tumors. Thus, in the model, the tumor
compartment can represent either an aggregate volume of
metastases or a primary tumor. Due to the wide range of
possibilities that could be represented for different types and
stages of cancer, we adopt the parameters for this compartment from our previous study (16) and conduct a sensitivity
study to ascertain that our qualitative conclusions are not
dependent on the choice of parameters.
For each simulation, the system was first equilibrated at a
baseline for a cancer patient with tumor before the injection of
the VEGF-neutralizing agent. At time zero, intravenous infusion of the anti-VEGF agent begins and delivery to the blood
compartment continues as a slow infusion for 90 minutes. We
considered two treatment regimens: a single-dose treatment
of 10 mg/kg or 10 consecutive daily doses of 1 mg/kg (metronomic therapy).
The parameters and their assigned numerical values are
summarized in Supplement 3. The equations governing the 3compartment VEGF transport system have been described in
our previous papers (16, 21) and can be found in Supplement 1.
We have also added equations to describe the interactions and
intercompartmental transport of the anti-VEGF molecule
(Equations S.30–S.38).

Results
Experiments demonstrate an inverse relationship between
microvascular permeability and the size of a molecule (molecular weight or Stokes–Einstein radius; refs. 22–24). Therefore,
in the absence of active transport, large proteins, such as antiVEGF agents (150 kDa for bevacizumab and 110 kDa for
aflibercept), should extravasate relatively slowly. In apparent
agreement with this, the level of bevacizumab following an
intravenous injection has been observed to be several times
lower in normal tissues (25) and in tumors (19) than in the
blood. However, little is known about what role, if any, the
extravasation of an anti-VEGF agent may play in the therapeutic mechanism. To address this issue, we considered two
computational scenarios: in the first, the anti-VEGF agent is
constrained in the blood compartment (negligible extravasation); in the second, the extravasation of the anti-VEGF agent
is included.
Plasma-free VEGF is predicted to decrease following
intravenous injection of an anti-VEGF agent confined
to the blood compartment (no extravasation)
Changes in plasma- and tissue-free VEGF are summarized
in Fig. 1A for a single-injection (10 mg/kg) and Fig. 1C for
metronomic therapy (1 mg/kg daily for 10 days), that is,
repeated lower doses over a longer period of time (26). Total
amount of drug injected is the same in both scenarios.

www.aacrjournals.org

If the anti-VEGF agent is confined to the blood compartment, a single injection causes the concentration of free VEGF
(i.e., not bound to anti-VEGF) in plasma to decrease precipitously by 98.4% (Fig. 1A, dashed line; minimum as the infusion
ends), as the anti-VEGF agent binds to VEGF available in
plasma. However, this is not predicted to significantly affect
the free VEGF level in the healthy tissue [maximum 0.1% drop
at 9 hours (solid line)] or the free VEGF level in the tumor
compartment [maximum 0.2% drop at 30 hours (dotted line)].
The free anti-VEGF agent saturated the blood (Supplementary
Figure S1A) and reached a maximum of 1.7 mmol/L in
plasma (88 mg/mL plasma) at the end of the infusion, which
corresponds to the total injected amount of the 150-kDa agent
distributed in the volume of plasma for a 70-kg patient. The
VEGF/anti-VEGF complex reached its maximum concentration in the blood (2.1 nmol/L) after about 12 days (Supplementary Figure S2A). The total (free and bound to the antiVEGF agent) VEGF concentration is typically what is measured by VEGF ELISA methods (see Supplement 2 for a
compilation of experimental data on free/total VEGF changes
following bevacizumab administration). Our results show a
100- to a 1,000-fold difference between free VEGF concentration (Fig. 1) and the concentration of VEGF bound to the antiVEGF (Supplementary Figure S2). Because of this difference in
magnitude, the unbound VEGF concentration represents only
a small percentage of the total VEGF concentration, and thus
Supplementary Figure S2 also illustrates the total VEGF concentration profile.
For metronomic therapy (lower daily dose of 1 mg/kg over
10 days), the free VEGF in plasma declines 86.8% following the
first infusion, but is predicted to reach a pseudo-steady state
after multiple infusions (Fig. 1C, dashed line). The concentration of free VEGF returned to its baseline level within 3 weeks
once the treatment was stopped. Metronomic therapy showed
delayed and lowered maximum levels of anti-VEGF compared
to the single-dose regimen (Supplementary Figure S1C versus
Supplementary Figure S1A); although the half-life of the antiVEGF agent is relatively long, it is being cleared from plasma
continuously. The VEGF/anti-VEGF complex (and therefore
the total VEGF concentration) reached its maximum about a
week later than for the single dose (Supplementary Figure S2C
versus Supplementary Figure S2A).
For an anti-VEGF agent that extravasates, plasma-free
VEGF is predicted to first decrease and then increase
above the baseline level
As for a nonextravasating anti-VEGF agent (Fig. 1A),
plasma-free VEGF decreased (97.0% drop in the first 45
minutes) following administration of anti-VEGF that can
extravasate (Fig. 1B, dashed line), as the agent binds to the
available free VEGF. In this case, however, VEGF concentration then rebounded to 41.1 pmol/L (a 9.1-fold increase over
baseline) after about 1 week. Unlike the no-extravasation case
where the concentration returned to baseline after 3 weeks,
the free VEGF concentration in plasma was predicted to
remain significantly elevated after 3 weeks (40.5 pmol/L, 9fold the baseline level). The free VEGF concentration in the
normal (solid line) and tumor (dotted line) tissues both also

showed an initial transient decrease (58.5% and 88.9%, respectively), followed by a slight rebound, reaching steady states
6.8% and 69.7% below baseline, respectively. This could be due
to the long half-life of the anti-VEGF agent (21 days) as
compared to the characteristic times of clearance, binding
affinities, and internalization rates of VEGF receptors. This
may suggest that an important whether not the primary action
of the anti-VEGF agent is to deplete the tumor VEGF after the
anti-VEGF extravasation. Interestingly, the increase of free
VEGF in plasma is also predicted even in the absence of a
tumor compartment (data not shown).
Supplementary Figure S1B shows the dynamic response of
the free anti-VEGF agent concentration. Upon injection, the
free anti-VEGF concentration at first increases but then
decreases rapidly within the next 12 hours as it travels to
the normal and tumor tissues. Interestingly, the free antiVEGF concentrations in the blood and in the tumor were
almost identical. This was mainly due to the higher microvascular permeability and the absence of functioning lymphatics in the tumor. The formation of the VEGF/anti-VEGF

complex (and the total VEGF concentration) reached a maximum after about 4 days and was significantly higher in the
tumor than in the other compartments due to higher VEGF
concentrations (Supplementary Figure S2B).
In metronomic therapy (Fig. 1D), similar results were
observed. The free VEGF concentration decreased in the
plasma upon the anti-VEGF injection then rebounded and
increased further after each injection (dashed line). In the
healthy and tumor compartments (solid and dotted lines,
respectively), a decrease in the free VEGF concentration
was observed, followed by a rebound effect without exceeding
their respective baseline levels. In all three compartments, the
free VEGF concentrations are predicted to reach a steady state
at the end of the 10 days of treatment and then remain almost
constant (varying within a small range) over the duration of
the experiment: the free VEGF level in the tumor was significantly decreased (70.1%), whereas that in the plasma was
significantly increased (by 8-fold) as compared to the baseline.
Although the rebound in free VEGF in plasma occurred after
45 minutes, the rebound still happens if we limit the duration

of the treatment to 45 minutes instead of 90 minutes (data not
shown). The free anti-VEGF concentration peaked following
each injection, reaching an overall maximum after 10 days of
about half that for the single-dose treatment (Supplementary
Figure S1D versus Supplementary Figure S1B). Interestingly,
more VEGF/anti-VEGF complex was formed in the tumor
(dotted line) than in the blood (dashed line) or in the normal
tissue (solid line), regardless of the regimen (Supplementary
Figures S2B and S2D) for single-injection and metronomic
therapy, respectively). This also means that the total VEGF
concentration was higher in the tumor than in the blood or the
normal tissue.
Formation of the VEGF/anti-VEGF complex mediates
the depletion of VEGF from the tumor
The changes in VEGF concentrations induced by the antiVEGF agent can be interpreted by a detailed study of the
movement of VEGF and anti-VEGF between the three compartments. We define the net flow for each molecule as the
difference between the intercompartmental flows of that
molecule (in moles per unit time) entering and leaving the
compartment. For example, the net intercompartmental flow
of VEGF in the normal tissue is the difference between VEGF
influx (by extravasation) and VEGF leaving the compartment
(by intravasation and lymphatic drainage). With this metric,
any negative net flows represent flows of diffusible molecules
traveling from the blood into the normal tissue or the tumor
compartment, whereas positive net flow illustrates the flow of
molecules entering the blood compartment. To visualize the
relative effects, we plotted the net intercompartmental flows
on the same graph. Figure 2 illustrates the net flows for the
free VEGF, free anti-VEGF agent, and VEGF/anti-VEGF complex for the few hours following the anti-VEGF agent intravenous injection.
The anti-VEGF net flows (light gray) increased significantly
during the first 6 to 12 hours in the normal (solid line) and
tumor tissues (dotted line), showing extravasation of the anti-

VEGF agent followed by subsequent binding to VEGF once in
the normal or tumor tissues. For example, within 4 to 5 hours,
58% of VEGF in the healthy tissue has become complexed with
the anti-VEGF agent (Fig. 1B). This is mainly due to the fact
that the dose of the anti-VEGF agent injected is several orders
of magnitude higher than the free VEGF concentration in the
blood and, therefore, the anti-VEGF saturates the plasma
upon injection. This concentration difference is counteracted
by the microvascular permeability of the high molecular
weight (150 kDa) anti-VEGF being lower than that of VEGF
(45 kDa).
The net intercompartmental flow of the VEGF/anti-VEGF
complex reveals that effectively, there is a net flow of complex
intravasating from the normal tissue. This result suggests that
the role of the anti-VEGF is to deplete VEGF from the
interstitial spaces of the normal tissue and the tumor in
the form of a complex.
The VEGF distribution is modified by the injection of
the anti-VEGF agent
Relative VEGF distribution changes in normal tissue, blood,
and tumor upon administration of the anti-VEGF agent
(Fig. 3). In the blood (middle graph), there is no significant
amount of free VEGF because most of it is complexed with the
anti-VEGF agent. In the normal and tumor tissues (top and
bottom graphs, respectively), most VEGF is complexed with
the anti-VEGF agent (light gray region). The decrease in the
relative amount of unbound VEGF in each compartment
(black region), however, is mostly due to increase in total
VEGF, due to the formation of VEGF/anti-VEGF complex
(Supplementary Figure S3). In normal tissue, unbound VEGF
declines only transiently; in tumors, there is a steady-state
decline, where VEGF is much less bound to its receptors (drop
by 48% - dark gray region) and less sequestered in the matrix
(drop by 69% - white region) than before injection.
The administration of the anti-VEGF agent significantly
modifies the VEGFR1 and NRP1 occupancies in the
tumor
In keeping with the predicted effect on unbound VEGF
(Fig. 1), occupancy of the receptors in normal tissue was only
transiently altered by the administration of the anti-VEGF
agent (Fig. 4, solid line), whereas the VEGFR1 and NRP1
occupancies (top and bottom graphs) in the tumor were
significantly decreased (from 31% to about 10%, and 35% to
about 18% for VEGFR1 and NRP1, respectively) and remained
fairly unchanged over the course of the experiment (dotted
lines). Changes in VEGFR2 occupancy appeared less significant (middle graph), due to the saturation of tumor VEGFR2
by cell-surface association of VEGF-bound NRP1; we assume
10-fold higher NRP1 expression on tumor endothelial cell
surfaces than that of VEGFR2 in our model and 10-fold higher
than on normal tissue endothelial cells. The effect of parameters on the qualitative results of the study is discussed
below. VEGFR2 occupancy after the anti-VEGF administration
does not significantly change in the tumor compartment as
compared to baseline (50% and 100% ligated in single and

Discussion and Conclusion
The mechanism of action of bevacizumab has been commonly accepted as its binding to the VEGF protein resulted
in inhibition of angiogenesis. However, recent analysis
points out that "whereas the molecular targets for anti-VEGF
therapy with large molecules are identified, the mechanism
of action, that is, how an anti-VEGF approach can exert
single-agent activity in some cancers and augment the
efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, is not well under-

stood" (3). It is important to know if the binding takes place
in the blood or tumor, and how it might affect the signaling
via VEGF receptors. Our systems biology study is aimed at
clarifying these questions.
Our model provides insights into the potential mechanisms
of action of anti-VEGF agents. However, the implications of
current model assumptions need to be considered. Our conclusions might depend on the tumor microenvironment,
specifically on the VEGF receptor expression on endothelial,
cancer, and stromal cells. VEGF receptor expression in vivo
has not been quantitatively characterized. However, our sensitivity analysis where we vary some of these factors shows
that the qualitative conclusions remain unchanged (data not
shown). A decrease in VEGF degradation by proteases may
also contribute to increasing the VEGF level in the plasma. It is
also possible that VEGF molecules are released from platelets
that have a very high VEGF concentration (27, 28). Proteases

Increased Plasma VEGF Predicted by a Pharmacokinetic Model

or platelets are not included in the present model but should
be added as more quantitative data become available.
Supplementary Table S1 summarizes changes of VEGF
levels following a bevacizumab injection found in the literature. In 2001, Gordon and colleagues reported that serum total
VEGF level increased whereas serum-free VEGF level
decreased (4). They suggested that this behavior could be
the result of VEGF synthesis or a decrease in VEGF clearance
due to the complexation with the VEGF antibody. A year later,
Hsei and colleagues performed an experiment on rats to
assess this issue and showed that the VEGF clearance
decreased about 3-fold in the presence of bevacizumab,
whereas the clearance and terminal half-life of bevacizumab
were not significantly changed by the complexation (9).
However, more recently, a similar behavior was seen following
the treatment of VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (11, 12, 29),
leading to the possibility that the decrease in VEGF clearance
may not be sufficient to explain the counterintuitive phenomenon. Importantly, Loupakis and colleagues showed that
immunodepleted blood samples revealed a significant
decrease of VEGF after bevacizumab injection (12). Our model
can assess both free and total VEGF, and shows that free VEGF
(and total VEGF) can increase or decrease depending on the
ability for bevacizumab and its complex to extravasate. It
would be of interest to add platelets and leukocytes to our
compartment model that can sequester VEGF and investigate
whether that could provide more insights into the phenomenon.
Note that except for glioblastomas where bevacizumab has
indicated use as a single agent, bevacizumab has been
approved by the FDA as a combination therapy for other
cancers. Our simulations using a quantitative molecular-based
pharmacokinetic model provide a possible characterization
for the mechanism of action of the anti-VEGF agents. In
particular, we predict that the mechanism of action of antiVEGF agents includes depleting the tumor interstitial VEGF,
and not the blood VEGF, which increases in qualitative
agreement with several experimental studies. The concentration of the anti-VEGF agent after intravenous injection is six
orders of magnitude higher than that of the VEGF present in
the plasma (micromolar levels in Supplementary Figure S1 for
the anti-VEGF agent as compared to picomolar levels in Fig. 1
for VEGF). Therefore, upon injection, most of the free VEGF in
the plasma binds to the anti-VEGF molecules that saturate the
blood. Despite the relatively low microvascular permeability
for the anti-VEGF agent, the anti-VEGF molecules extravasate
(Fig. 2) and bind to free VEGF in the interstitial space (Figs. 1,

3, and S2). This leads to a significant decrease of free VEGF in
the tumor (Fig. 2), leading to a decrease in ligation of two
receptors (VEGFR1 and NRP1). However, the simulations
predict that the VEGFR2 remains nearly fully ligated in the
tumor compartment (Fig. 4). These results are not obvious: the
anti-VEGF agent has a high molecular weight (about 150 kDa)
so one would not expect the microvascular permeability to
play a very important role for the anti-VEGF agent transport.
Our model shows that, on the contrary, the inclusion of
intercompartment transport is crucial to understand the
mechanism of action of the anti-VEGF agent. Even the small
fraction of anti-VEGF agent that traverses the endothelial
barrier (into the normal tissue or tumor) affects VEGF level in
the interstitium, especially in the tumor (Fig. 1). Our model
reveals that this phenomenon is intrinsic to the system and
does not require any further hypotheses regarding the VEGF
system and/or the drug; however, the processes hypothesized
by other groups may also play a role in the overall mechanism
of action. Our computational model suggests that it would be
of great interest to design an experiment where tracking of the
binding of the drug and tracking of the flows of VEGF, antiVEGF, and VEGF/anti-VEGF complex would be included.
We asked whether the drug acts by sequestering VEGF in
the blood, tumor interstitium or both, and whether, as a result,
the VEGF concentration in these compartments is reduced to
"normal" levels. Our model shows that the drug may act by
depleting VEGF from the tumor interstitium, rather than
depleting VEGF in the blood where the concentration
decreases transiently followed by a several-fold sustained
increase. The model also shows that the VEGF concentration
in the tissue compartments are not reduced to the "normal"
levels but instead reach a new pseudo-steady state, close to the
level of VEGF in the normal tissue prior to injection. We hope
that these results will motivate new experiments to investigate
the binding and flows in the VEGF system under an anti-VEGF
treatment and that our model will initiate new investigations
for therapeutic purposes and drug design.
