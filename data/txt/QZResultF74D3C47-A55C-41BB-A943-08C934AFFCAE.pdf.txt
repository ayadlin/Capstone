Abstract
Whole-exome sequencing of metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) reveals that 5% to 7% of tumors
harbor promyelocytic leukemia zinc ﬁnger (PLZF) protein
homozygous deletions. PLZF is a canonical androgen-regulated
putative tumor suppressor gene whose expression is inhibited
by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we demonstrate
that knockdown of PLZF expression promotes a CRPC and
enzalutamide-resistant phenotype in prostate cancer cells.
Reintroduction of PLZF expression is sufﬁcient to reverse

androgen-independent growth mediated by PLZF depletion.
PLZF loss enhances CRPC tumor growth in a xenograft model.
Bioinformatic analysis of the PLZF cistrome shows that PLZF
negatively regulates multiple pathways, including the MAPK
pathway. Accordingly, our data support an oncogenic program
activated by ADT. This acquired mechanism together with the
ﬁnding of genetic loss in CRPC implicates PLZF inactivation as
a mechanism promoting ADT resistance and the CRPC phenotype. Cancer Res; 75(10); 1944–8. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

cancer (CRPC) emerges (2). Newer agents targeting the androgen
signaling axis (AR-targeted therapies), such as abiraterone and
enzalutamide, have yielded improved outcomes for patients with
CRPC. Unfortunately, not all patients with CRPC respond to these
AR-targeted therapies, and moreover, these agents are not curative
in this setting (3). The main subset of mechanisms of resistance to
these antagonists involves the AR signaling pathway, including AR
gene overexpression, gain-of-function mutations, constitutively
active AR splice variants, dysregulation of its coregulators, and de
novo androgen synthesis (4). Additional categories of resistance
mechanisms consist of de-repression of progrowth pathways in
response to ADT (5) or transformation to a distinct, androgen,
and AR-indifferent cell state (4).
The recent surge of genomic and transcriptomic information
may permit molecular classiﬁcation of CRPC and future clinical
development of precision medicine based on predictive biomarkers (5). Intriguingly, whole-exome sequencing of metastatic
CRPC (mCRPC) revealed that 5% to 7% of tumors harbor
promyelocytic leukemia zinc ﬁnger (PLZF) focal homozygous
deletions. PLZF, also known as BTB-containing protein 16
(ZBTB16), was originally identiﬁed as a gene fused to RARa in
acute promyelocytic leukemia patients (6). PLZF has been shown
to play an important role in the regulation of major developmental and biologic processes and carcinogenesis as a tumor
suppressor gene, since it regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis
in various cell types (7). Overexpression of PLZF was shown to
inhibit cellular proliferation in AR-positive LNCaP and AR-negative DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines (8, 9). Herein, our data
show that PLZF emerged as the top gene from an AR cistrome
analysis, credentialing PLZF as an androgen-regulated putative
tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer. Accordingly, we report a

A long-standing challenge in the management of prostate
cancer is the development of resistance to androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT), a standard treatment to disrupt the androgen
receptor (AR) signaling pathway, because AR has a profound effect
on prostate carcinogenesis through the regulation of transcriptional networks, genomic stability, and gene fusions (1).
Although ADT is initially effective and presumably extends the
survival of most prostate cancer patients, prostate cancer inevitably becomes resistant to ADT and castration-resistant prostate

PLZF-Mediated Resistance to ADT

resistance mechanism to ADT mediated by PLZF, which appears
to result from the activation of progrowth pathways in response
to ADT. Furthermore, the ﬁndings of PLZF genetic loss in
mCRPC tumors support that PLZF may be an important mediator
in a subset of CRPC tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, lentiviral infection, and xenografts
LNCaP/22Rv1 and VCaP cells were cultured in RPMI1640 and
DMEM medium with 10% FBS. 22Rv1 xenografts were established in the ﬂanks of male nude mice by injecting approximately
2 million stable 22Rv1 cells with shCtrl or shPLZF knockdown in
50% Matrigel 3 days after castration. Tumors were measured 3
times every week and harvested after 3 weeks. All animal experiments were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines
Cell proliferation (crystal violet staining/WST1)
Cell growth was examined using the crystal violet (CV) staining
and WST1 assays (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol.
CV was dissolved in 10% acetic acid and cell proliferation calculated relative to the negative control cells, by measuring the
absorbance at 595 nm.
qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry
RNAs were extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers are listed in Supplementary Text. qPCR
data are represented as mean  STD for more than 3 replicates.
Blots were incubated with anti-PLZF (MAB2944; R&D Systems),
anti-actin (A5316; Sigma), total p44/42 MAK (Erk1/2; 4695;
Cell Signaling), or phospho-p44/42 MAK (Erk1/2; 4370; Cell
Signaling). Parafﬁn sections underwent antigen retrieval and were
subjected to the staining protocol using Dako EnVisionþSystemHRP 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB). Anti-PLZF (MAB2944; R & D

Systems), anti-Ki67 (Dako), or nonspeciﬁc IgG was then added
overnight at 4 C. Sections compared in each ﬁgure were stained
at the same time and photographed under identical conditions.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and ChIP-Seq data
analysis
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed as previously described (10). The PLZF antibody
(MAB2944; R&D Systems) or nonspeciﬁc IgG was used for ChIP.
ChIP-Seq raw data were mapped by Bowtie 2 with default parameters. The identiﬁcation of ChIP-seq peaks (bound regions
and summit) was performed using MACS (PMID: 18798982).
Regions of enrichment comparing to input control exceeding a
given threshold (P < 1e–5) were called as peaks. The primers for
qPCR are provided in the Supplementary Text.
Gene expression experiments and analysis
LNCaP cells were transfected with either control shRNA
(shCtrl) or shRNAs targeting PLZF (shPLZF). Forty-eight hours
after shRNA transfection, total RNA was isolated and hybridized
to Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 expression array (Affymetrix).
Raw data are preprocessed using RMA (PMID: 12538238) and
the cutoff of 1.5-fold change, and P value of <0.05 is applied
for differential expressed gene analysis.

Results and Discussion
The hope of precision medicine is to tailor treatment based on
each patient's genomic and transcriptomic characteristics. This
approach has proven to be challenging for the management of
prostate cancer because of the paucity of actionable mutations
found thus far. The recent ﬁnding (11) that 7% (4/61) of mCRPC
tumors harbored PLZF homozygous deletions captured our interest (Fig. 1A). Indeed, homozygous deletion of PLZF was further
seen in two independent cohorts: 6% (4/63) and 5% (8/152)
from the University of Washington and the Stand Up to Cancer/

Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C/PCF), which will be part
of a larger SU2C genomic landscape article (personal communications). This prompted us to explore the role of PLZF in
prostate cancer. Here, we postulated that because PLZF was
androgen regulated, AR might activate PLZF, an intermediate
tumor suppressor gene that might derepress an oncogenic program with androgen depletion. This was based on the observation
that ADT induces the expression of androgen-repressed genes that
normally regulate androgen synthesis, DNA replication, and cell
cycle progression in CRPC models (12).
Taking an agnostic approach, we sought androgen-regulated
candidate tumor suppressor genes. We compiled two AR cistrome datasets and showed that PLZF was the canonical tumor
suppressor gene with strongest androgen-induced AR recruitment to its putative enhancer regions in two androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2A), implying that the tumor suppression
function of PLZF may be diminished upon ADT treatment.
The androgen-stimulated effect on PLZF expression was demonstrated in LNCaP, VCaP, and 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). More importantly, PLZF expression was

repressed by an antiandrogen (bicalutamide) in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 1B, bottom).
To explore the tumor suppressive function of PLZF on prostate cancer, we examined the biologic effect of altered
PLZF expression on cell growth in androgen-depleted condition. Knockdown of PLZF using four different shRNA constructs
(shPLZF#1#4) promoted androgen-independent growth in
LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Conversely,
re-expression of PLZF reversed the androgen-independent
growth mediated by PLZF depletion (Fig. 1D).
To determine whether PLZF perturbation might promote
androgen-independent growth in vivo, we also analyzed the
growth of 22Rv1 prostate cancer xenograft expressing PLZF
shRNAs, in castrated nude mice. Consistent with the in vitro
observations, PLZF knockdown enhanced tumor formation in
castrate levels of androgen (Fig. 2A). Altogether, our results show
that PLZF is a putative AR-regulated tumor suppressor gene.
Next, we interrogated the extent to which PLZF expression
might be altered in patient-derived CRPC tumor samples and
found that mean PLZF expression was signiﬁcantly lower in CRPC
bone metastases compared with primary tumors (Fig. 2B),

PLZF-Mediated Resistance to ADT

consistent with the notion that ADT suppresses serum and tissue
androgens and results in diminished AR pathway activity (9).
The subcellular localization of PLZF is mainly in the nucleus
where it achieves its transcriptional repression by binding to
the regulatory elements in the promoter region of the target
genes (7). In order to uncover PLZF-regulated transcriptome,
we deﬁned the PLZF cistrome using PLZF ChIP-seq and gene
proﬁling data sets (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Next, we investigated the potential biologic consequence of
PLZF suppression. Genes whose expression was upregulated in
PLZF-depleted LNCaP cells were subjected to bioinformatic
pathway analysis. KEGG analysis revealed that PLZF-repressed
genes were signiﬁcantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 5 genes with PLZF-binding sites, RRAS, MKNK2,
DDIT3, JUND, and JUN (Supplementary Table S3). ChIP- and
qRT-PCR conﬁrmed that these genes are part of the PLZFrepressed cistrome (Fig. 3B). More importantly, PLZF knockdown substantially induced phospho-ERK1/2 expression
upon EGF stimulation in LNCaP (Fig. 3C, left). We also
observed elevated levels of phospho-ERK activity in PLZFdepleted 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 3C, right). The inhibitory effect of
MAPK inhibitors (UO126 and AZD6244) on PLZF-depleted
LNCaP was assessed. Cells with PLZF depletion responded
better to MAPK inhibitors as compared with shCtrl, implying
that the MAPK pathway may be activated due to loss of PLZF
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Although our results suggest that PLZF regulates ERK1/2
activity, it is unlikely that the mechanism underlying ERK
activation only depends on PLZF transcriptional modulation.
Moreover, PLZF has been shown to regulate a variety of downstream targets at the posttranslational level (13). PLZF-regulated intracellular signaling molecules may also cross-talk with
other regulatory pathways. Nonetheless, taken together, our
data suggest that suppression of PLZF may permit sustained
prostate cancer cell growth under conditions of androgen
deprivation in part by de-repressing key tumorigenic mechanisms, such as ERK1/2 signaling. This ﬁnding may partly explain

and is in agreement with previous ﬁndings that MAPK signaling
is upregulated in some CRPC murine models and patientderived tumor samples (14–16). Thus, in the subset of patients
with low PLZF expression including genetic loss, MAPK pathway inhibition may be of particular importance.
To begin to explore the potential effect of PLZF loss on
AR-targeted therapy, we evaluated the impact of enzalutamide
on the growth of prostate cancer cells in the absence or presence
of PLZF knockdown. As expected, enzalutamide completely
killed the shLuc-silenced cells when cultured in the regular conditioned medium. PLZF-depleted cells showed the ability to
grow, although to a lesser extent, even in presence of enzalutamide (Fig. 4A). When we conducted the same experiment culturing the cells in androgen-deprived medium (charcoal-stripped
serum, CSS), we observed a similar growth pattern. While shLuc
cells remained quiescent in absence of androgens, shPLZF cells
showed slight sensitivity to enzalutamide at early time point,
becoming progressively resistant to the drug at late time points
(Fig. 4B). To determine whether the presence of AR is required
for PLZF-dependent growth, we introduced an Isopropyl b-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible shAR in the shPLZFstable LNCaP cells. Strikingly, our data showed that PLZF loss
enables LNCaP cells to proliferate even in the absence of androgens or AR expression (Fig. 4C). These results imply that PLZF
inactivation may be a key factor in the development of resistance
to AR-directed therapeutics, such as enzalutamide. Collectively,
our data suggest that PLZF suppression or genetic loss may
underlie a novel mode of resistance to ADT, wherein an ARrepressed oncogenic program facilitates residual prostate tumor
cells to adjust to castrate levels of androgens to survive or grow.
In view of the AR-dependent mechanisms for CRPC development, ADT may directly or indirectly activate an AR-repressed
network, although we cannot completely exclude the involvement of oncogenic activation mediated by persistent AR expression in residual prostate tumors. Accordingly, we report that the
upregulation of the PLZF-repressed oncogenic program is an
acquired mechanism in response to ADT and that genetic loss of

(B) and treated with or without 2.5 mmol/L of enzalutamide or IPTG-inducible shAR knockdown (C), followed by CV staining at the time as indicated. Each
column was relative to the corresponding ﬁrst column and shown as mean  SD (n  3);  , P < 0.05.

PLZF in the course of disease is important molecular event in
the emergence of CRPC and development of resistance to ADT
and perhaps enzalutamide. Presumably, prostate cancer genomic
and transcriptomic information may permit better molecular
classiﬁcation and provide new insights into the mechanisms of
resistance to androgen/AR signaling blockade, thus aiding the
design of future therapeutic combinations to overcome drug
resistance.
