ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a primary obstacle to curative cancer therapy.
We have previously demonstrated that β-casein (β-CN) micelles (β-CM) can serve as
nanovehicles for oral delivery and target-activated release of hydrophobic drugs in the
stomach. Herein we introduce a novel nanosystem based on β-CM, to orally deliver a
synergistic combination of a chemotherapeutic drug (Paclitaxel) and a P-glycoproteinspecific transport inhibitor (Tariquidar) individually encapsulated within β-CM, for
overcoming MDR in gastric cancer. Light microscopy, dynamic light scattering and
zeta potential analyses revealed solubilization of these drugs by β-CN, suppressing
drug crystallization. Spectrophotometry demonstrated high loading capacity and good
encapsulation efficiency, whereas spectrofluorometry revealed high affinity of these
drugs to β-CN. In vitro cytotoxicity assays exhibited remarkable synergistic efficacy
against human MDR gastric carcinoma cells with P-glycoprotein overexpression. Oral
delivery of β-CN - based nanovehicles carrying synergistic drug combinations to the
stomach constitutes a novel efficacious therapeutic system that may overcome MDR
in gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

sessions [3, 4]. Furthermore, hospitalization is dangerous
for immunocompromised cancer patients, due to
drug-resistant pathogens widespread in hospitals [5].
Moreover, many patients who apparently respond to firstline chemotherapy frequently face tumor progression or
recurrence, necessitating additional chemotherapeutic
cycles. Consequently, the response decreases and the
therapy becomes ineffective due to the frequent emergence
of multiple drug resistance phenomena [6–10].
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major hindrance
to curative cancer therapy [6]. Drug resistance frequently
occurs as a primary (inherent) or secondary (acquired
following chemotherapeutic treatment) tumor defense
mechanism against multiple cytotoxic drugs. One of

Gastrointestinal cancers are the third leading
cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. Gastric
cancer is classified into two histologically distinct types:
intestinal and diffuse. Intestinal-type tumor cells have
tubular structures characterized by reduced stroma that
frequently ulcerate providing a barrier-free path for drugs
to infiltrate the tumor from the gastric lumen, whereas, the
diffuse-type tumors cause mucosal dysplasia [2].
Most current chemotherapeutics are administered
intravenously (IV), causing discomfort and stress to
patients, and high costs due to multiple hospitalizations
required to complete a series of IV chemotherapeutic

the major mechanisms of MDR is enhanced energydependent efflux of numerous hydrophobic cytotoxic
drugs, which diffuse into cells through the plasma
membrane [11]. This ATP-dependent efflux is mediated
by transmembrane transporters of the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) superfamily, of which P-glycoprotein
(P-gp/ABCB1) is considered the most dominant [11].
P-gp is overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas [12]
where it markedly suppresses the efficacy of numerous
hydrophobic chemotherapeutics. Much research
focused on the development of compounds, known as
chemosensitizers, that inhibit MDR efflux transporters, to
achieve MDR reversal and re-sensitization of MDR cancer
cells to chemotherapy [11, 13].
Oral drug administration is a highly preferred
drug delivery route, promoting patient satisfaction
and compliance [4,  14]. It does not require medical
equipment or assistance, and thereby does not necessitate
hospitalization. The availability of suitable and effective
oral therapeutics would make a significant contribution
to patients’ quality of life, allowing less painful treatment
at the comfort of their home, circumvent infection
with antibiotic-resistant pathogens and significantly
reduce costs [15,  16]. However, many drugs cannot be
administered orally due to diverse factors, e.g. poor water
solubility, limiting their oral bioavailability and hampering
their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles
[14–16].
Bovine β-casein (β-CN), one of the major proteins
in milk, has a prominent amphiphilic structure [17]
enabling its self-assembly into stable micellar structures
in aqueous solution [18]. We have recently demonstrated
the potential of β-CN micelles (β-CM) as nanovehicles
for oral delivery of hydrophobic cargo (including
bioactives and chemotherapeutics [3, 19–21]) facilitating
encapsulation, stabilization [3, 19, 20, 22], protection, and
target-activated release under simulated gastric digestion
[21]. We have also shown that casein micelles enable
encapsulation of hydrophobic bioactives [23] and promote
their bioavailability, in a human clinical study [24]. β-CN
remains intact in saliva [25], however upon simulated
gastric digestion it rapidly degrades [21,  25]. Hence,
β-CM may serve as an efficient oral delivery nanovehicle
for target-activated release of chemotherapeutic drugs
for local treatment of gastric cancer, thereby minimizing
toxic side effects caused by systemic chemotherapy.
Drug entrapment in a gastrically-digestible protein
shell diminishes untoward toxicity to the upper gastrointestinal tract (buccal cavity and esophagus). Minimal
toxicity is expected for the healthy stomach tissue
because of the thick mucosal layer, which is depleted in
the tumor area of intestinal-type gastric tumors [2]. The
β-CM delivery system is not intended to provide cancercell-specific targeting, but rather target-activated release
in the stomach. However, it may be expected to obtain
an improved tumor-focused local treatment in the case
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

where the gastric tumor forms a local discontinuity in the
mucosal lining of the internal stomach surface, or in the
case of post-surgical chemotherapy.
Paclitaxel (PTX) is a highly lipophilic [26]
chemotherapeutic drug (log P = 4.54 [27]), hence aqueous
solubilization or encapsulation is required for its
administration. PTX inhibits mitosis by binding to
β-tubulin, leading to the formation of stable, nonfunctional, microtubules hence blocking cellular
proliferation [28]. As most chemotherapeutic regimens,
PTX causes serious side effects, including peripheral
nervous system toxicity [27], due to insufficient
selectivity. Its limited tumor-bioaccessibility leads to
large doses, inducing higher untoward toxicity and
emergence of MDR; PTX is a bona fide P-gp transport
substrate [29]. Tariquidar (TQD) (log P = 6.1) [30] is a
potent, third-generation P-gp transport inhibitor, and thus
a specific MDR chemosensitizer. TQD acts either by avid
noncompetitive binding to P-gp, or by inhibiting P-gp
ATPase activity, or both [31].
Herein we developed a novel β-CN-based targetactivated nanosystem for oral delivery of synergistic
combinations of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs
and MDR chemosensitizers. We designed this nanosystem
for treatment of MDR gastric cancer, exploiting both the
ability of β-CN to self-assemble into micelles (while
entrapping hydrophobic drugs) and its evolutionary
ability to be easily digested in the stomach. Because MDR
chemosensitizers enhance both bioavailability [16,  32]
and cytotoxic activity [33, 34] of chemotherapeutics in
cancer cells, we expect that such pairs of encapsulated
drugs would display synergy in overcoming MDR
gastric cancers. It is possible to co-encapsulate drug
combinations within the same nanoparticle, or to
individually encapsulate each drug, and later prepare the
desired combinations by mixing the encapsulated drugs.
By pre-encapsulating each drug separately we may form
modular powder forms of the individually encapsulated
drugs, which could then be easily mixed by the pharmacist
according to the intended personalized treatment, without
having to encapsulate the specific mixture. Furthermore,
individual drug encapsulation enables avoiding drug-drug
interactions thus extending product self-life. Therefore, the
primary goal of the current research was to individually
encapsulate a chemotherapeutic drug (PTX) and a
chemosensitizer (TQD) within β-CM, and to evaluate the
efficacy of their combined system against human P-gpdependent MDR gastric cancer cells.

(Supplementary Figure S1), provided qualitative evidence
that drug binding to β-CN occurred. This also confirmed
the existence of binding-induced static quenching,
supporting further quantitative study of drug binding to
β-CN using fluorescence (Ex. 270 nm; Em. 356 nm) [35].
Figure 1 shows the increase in fluorescence intensity ratio
of β-CN and drug-loaded β-CM as a function of drug:βCN molar ratio. The association constant (KSV) and the
static quenching constant (V) calculated by non-linear
curve fitting (Equation (2)) [36] are presented in Table 1.
Evidently, both PTX and TQD bind to β-CN; about 85%
and 95% of the initial emission intensity of Trp143 was
quenched by PTX and TQD, respectively. The association
constant of PTX-β-CN (Table 1) is in accord with that
obtained previously in our lab [19]. Thus, β-CN exhibits a
2-fold higher affinity for TQD than for PTX.
Loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency
of each of the drugs were determined by centrifugal
sedimentation of unbound excess drug at increasing
drug:β-CN molar ratios (Figure  2). Maximal loading
capacities (Lmax) of PTX and TQD in β-CM, calculated
from the asymptote of the Langmuir model curve fit
(Equation (5)), are presented in Table 1. Expectedly,
increasing drug concentration led to increasing drug
loading capacity and decreasing encapsulation efficiency.

appearing as a sub-population of larger particles that
grow into microcrystals at very high TQD:β-CN molar
ratios. This process has been previously identified
by our group [19,  21]. PTX-β-CM display a similar
structural organization including intermediate PTX-β-CM
aggregates incorporating nano-sized PTX crystals.
The results are supported by light microscopy images
(Figure 3). These findings show that β-CN stabilizes PTX
and TQD against crystallization and aggregation.

Zeta potential analysis
Zeta potential results of β-CN and pure drug
solutions in PBS vs. solutions at the same drug
concentrations of drug-β-CN (1  mg/ml β-CN, at
6:1 drug:β-CN molar ratio for PTX and 4:1 for TQD) are
presented in Figure 5. β-CN in PBS showed zeta potential
value of -45.6 mV. The zeta potentials of PTX and TQD
in PBS were significantly closer to 0  mV suggesting a
colloidally unstable system. However in the drug:β-CM
molar ratios chosen for the in vitro cytotoxicity experiment
both drugs in β-CM showed zeta potential values more
negative than -40 mV, in line with our previous study [19],
indicating a colloidally stable system.

P-gp expression in human gastric carcinoma cell
lines by Western blot analysis

Drug-β-CN binding stoichiometry

Western blot analysis was used to quantify actual
P-gp levels in gastric carcinoma cell lines (Figure 6). The
MDR EPG85-257RDB subline overexpressed high levels
of P-gp, whereas P-gp was not detectable in its parental
EPG85-257P counterpart cells. Equal protein loading was
verified using an antibody against the α-subunit of Na+/
K+ ATPase.

A comparison between light microscopy images of
pure PTX or TQD in PBS and those in the presence of
β-CN (Figure 3) confirms that drug concentrations were
above the solubility limit in aqueous solution, forming
micrometer-sized crystal aggregates, while in the presence
of β-CN, sub-micron particles were formed. Apparently,
β-CN suppressed drug crystal growth and aggregation via
efficient encapsulation. Maximal loading capacity was
observed at 5:1 TQD:β-CN molar ratio (F), while above
it, TQD crystals were observed (H). 20:1 PTX:β-CN molar
ratio revealed PTX-β-CM aggregates that modestly glow
under polarized light (D). Super-saturation of PTX-βCM was unattainable due to the limitation of PTX stock
solution solubility and restriction of DMSO volume
percentage in the samples. This result (D) suggested that
the maximal loading capacity is about 20:1 PTX:β-CN
molar ratio, based on the minute drug aggregates observed.

Evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of
drug-loaded β-CM
The cytotoxic activity of free PTX was compared
with that of PTX- β-CM (6:1 PTX:β-CN molar ratio,
before and after SGD) in the presence or absence of
0.8  μM TQD, either free or in β-CM (4:1 TQD:β-CN
molar ratio, before and after SGD, respectively). The
fraction of surviving cells (relative to untreated controls)
vs. PTX concentration is presented in Figure  7A,  7C
and the IC50 values derived from a sigmoidal fitting of
the dose-response curves using Equation (6) are shown
in Figure  7D. Cells exposed to a 1  h pulse of SFM
containing 1 mg/ml pure undigested β-CN (20% PBS),
complete growth medium containing digested β-CN,
0.8 μM free TQD, and samples containing 0.1% DMSO
(v/v) in complete growth medium or in SFM were tested
as controls. No significant cytotoxicity was observed with
these controls (Supplementary Figure  S2A). Moreover,
cytotoxicity to parental EPG85-257P cells, following
a 1  h pulse of free PTX in complete growth medium

Analysis of nanoparticle size distribution by DLS
DLS was used to evaluate the size distribution of
PTX and TQD entrapped in β-CN at increasing drug:β-CN
molar ratios. Figure 4 reveals that particle size distribution
depends on the drug:β-CN molar ratio. At low TQD
concentrations, over 70% of the particles were < 100 nm.
Upon increase in the molar ratio, TQD apparently binds
first to the hydrophobic core of the β-CM. When the
micellar particles are maximally loaded with TQD,
excess of the drug starts forming larger aggregates,

was compared with free PTX in SFM parental EPG85257P cells; no substantial cytotoxicity was observed
in the presence of SFM (Supplementary Figure  S2B).
A 530-fold resistance to free PTX was observed in
P-gp-overexpressing MDR EPG85-257RDB cells,
compared to their parental cells (Figure 7A, 7D) which
were devoid of P-gp (Figure  6). The mean IC50 values
obtained for EPG85-257RDB and EPG85-257P cells were
11,129 ± 598 and 21 ± 2 nM, respectively. This resistance
was fully reversed by free TQD (0.8 µM). These results
also demonstrate that encapsulation and gastric digestion
did not interfere with the cytotoxic activity of the drugs
and even improved it in the case of the chemosensitizer as
the IC50 value for the parental cell line (23 ± 4 nM) was not
significantly different (P = 0.5944) from that of free PTX,
and the IC50 value of the MDR subline (3,135 ± 499 nM)
was decreased 3.5-fold (Figure 7B, 7D).
The cytotoxic activity of undigested PTX-β-CM
with and without undigested TQD-β-CM was determined
in SFM. The undigested drug-loaded micelles were tested
to evaluate the quality of drug entrapment (or, inversely,
the leakiness of the vehicle) prior to gastric digestion.
Undigested PTX-β-CM exhibited significantly lower
cytotoxicity than free PTX or digested PTX-β-CM,
demonstrating an important advantage of encapsulated
drug over free drug. The IC50 values were 4.3-fold
and 4.0-fold higher for the parental cells (91  ±  9  nM)
and 62-fold and 219-fold higher for the MDR subline
(686,860 ± 134,046 nM), respectively (Figure 7C, 7D).
This indicates that the loading of the chemotherapeutic
drug was effective but the encapsulation efficiency was
lower, ~60% as seen in our results of the calculated
encapsulation efficiency (Figure 2B), due to an equilibrium
between the drug within the micelles and the excess drug,
causing the cytotoxic effect. Expectedly, the cytotoxicity
of PTX-β-CM with and without undigested TQD-β-CM
towards EPG85-257P cells was not significantly different

(P =  0.2410). Furthermore, the addition of undigested
TQD-β-CM did not achieve a full MDR reversal, even
though the IC50 value decreased 314-fold, and was similar
to that of PTX-β-CM following SGD (P = 0.3720).

DISCUSSION
Based on our previous studies [3,  19–21] which
introduced the potential of β-CM as nanovehicles for
oral delivery and target-activated release of hydrophobic
drug cargo in the stomach, we herein devised a novel
nanosystem comprising a potent chemotherapeutic drug
(PTX) and a potent chemosensitizer (TQD), individually
encapsulated within β-CM, and assessed its in vitro
efficacy and drug resistance reversal potential using paired
MDR human gastric carcinoma cells. Both PTX and
TQD displayed good affinity for β-CN, which efficiently
entrapped, solubilized and stabilized them colloidally, and
prevented them from aggregating and crystallizing (below
its maximal loading capacity), as evidenced by several
complementary methods, including visual observation,
absorbance spectra, fluorescence spectroscopy, light
microscopy, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential.
These results were in line with previous studies that
investigated the binding of lipophilic molecules to β-CN,
including vitamin D3 [37], vitamin A [38], sucrose esters
[39], celecoxib [40] and curcumin [41], suggesting
that hydrophobic interactions are predominant in the
entrapment of hydrophobic compounds within β-CM.
Oral administration of PTX was recently examined
using different vehicles, including glycyrrhizic acid
micelles [42], pluronic-based micelles [43, 44], chitosanbased nanovehicles [45, 46] and lipid-based nanoparticles
(NPs) [45, 47]. However, none of these vehicles exhibited
target-activated release in the stomach. Following a
comprehensive literature survey we conclude that neither
a carrier for oral delivery of TQD, nor for oral delivery

of the combination of PTX and TQD have yet been
investigated.
The estimated maximal drug loading capacity
was ~20:1 (mol:mol) drug:β-CN for PTX, i.e. 712 mg/g
protein, and 5:1 (mol:mol) for TQD, which is 135 mg/g
protein. The result for TQD was in agreement with the
maximal loading capacity (Lmax, 136  mg/g protein)
calculated from the asymptote of the saturation curve
(Equation (5)) fitted to the plot in Figure 2A. For PTX,
however, the calculated Lmax (175 mg/g protein) differed
from the qualitatively estimated value. This difference
may be due to the formation of sub-micrometer crystals
of the excess drug, above the Lmax, which are below the
resolution limit of the optical microscope, but which
sediment upon centrifugation. Since the sedimentation
method is more quantitative and reliable, we conclude that
Lmax was ~175 mg/g protein. The Lmax values we found
for PTX were similar, while those for TQD were higher
than those reported in previous studies using different
nano-delivery systems designed to co-deliver PTX and
TQD (each encapsulated individually, and intended for
IV administration). A study using poly (D,L-lactide-coglycolide) NPs [48] reported 17.6% loading capacity

(i.e. about 210  mg PTX per gr polymer). They further
reported 2.6% TQD loading (i.e. about 27 mg TQD per
gr polymer), showing that β-CN displayed a 5-fold higher
Lmax for TQD compared to the PLGL NPs.
Our in vitro cytotoxicity results demonstrated that
TQD achieved a complete MDR reversal in the human
MDR gastric carcinoma cell line EPG85-257RDB. These
results confirmed that following SGD, the drugs were
properly released and their pharmacologic activity was
fully retained. Sustaining drug activity after SGD was
consistent with our previous findings for PTX-β-CM with
a different cancer cell line [21], suggesting that this drug
delivery system is suitable for oral delivery and gastric
release of hydrophobic drug combinations for treatment of
gastric disorders. Moreover, our current findings revealed
that encapsulation followed by SGD enhanced TQD
activity ~ 4-fold, presumably due to the suppression of drug
crystallization by β-CN. Another important observation
was that the encapsulated (and undigested) PTX-β-CM
showed significantly lower cytotoxicity than the free
or released drug (particularly for the MDR cells). The
slight cytotoxicity indicated a loading efficiency < 100%,
enabling the excess free drug to exert its activity. To

overcome this problem, a lower drug:protein ratio may
be used. Alternatively, the use of additional coating layers
[45, 49, 50] or protein crosslinking [51, 52] may enhance
drug encapsulation efficiency and increase protection
against untoward toxicity to the upper gastro-intestinal
tract. Previous studies testing similar improvements with
different delivery systems exhibited reduced toxicity
[50] and improved survival [45]. Target-activated release

of chemotherapeutics in the stomach might provoke
intestinal toxicity following gastric passage. In order to
obtain a maximal therapeutic index, we plan to develop
and optimize β-CN-based nanovehicles loaded with the
minimal drug dose needed for efficacious local gastric
treatment and minimal residual intestinal toxicity, by
performing dedicated in vivo studies with mouse models
harboring human gastric cancer xenografts.

Combinations of PTX and TQD, simultaneously
incorporated in a carrier, have been previously evaluated
with different delivery systems designed for IV
co-administration [48, 53]. This enhanced therapeutic
efficacy of the co-administered agents is attributable to
increased accumulation of PTX in drug-resistant tumor
cells [34,  48,  53]. Oral delivery is clearly desirable
over IV, which requires hospitalization, and is hence
costly and dangerous for immunocompromised cancer
patients.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that β-CM
exhibit efficient drug encapsulation, solubilization and
suppression of crystallization, and high loading capacities
of PTX and TQD. β-CM show great promise as an oral
nano-delivery platform for gastric target-activated release
of co-administered synergistic drug-chemosensitizer
combinations, for effectively overcoming MDR in gastric
cancer. This novel nanosystem could be applied for
the treatment of various gastric disorders and tailoring
individual drug combinations in personalized medicine.

Fluorescence quenching of tryptophan (Trp) 143,
located in the hydrophobic domain of β-CN [37,  39],
was used to determine the binding affinities of PTX and
TQD to β-CN. Trp fluorescence was determined using
excitation of 270 nm and recording emission from 300 to
450  nm, with 1  nm slit widths using a Fluorolog 3–22
spectrofluorometer (Horiba, Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau,
France). β-CN fluorescence was monitored at a constant
protein concentration of 1  mg/ml and either PTX or

Binding stoichiometry evaluation by light
microscopy
The binding stoichiometry, morphology and crystal
formation of the drugs with and without β-CN were studied
by light microscopy. The pictures were obtained using an
Olympus DP71 digital camera connected to an Olympus
BX51 light microscope operated with Nomarski differential
interference contrast (DIC) and polarized light optics
(x20 magnification, 24°C). Samples of 1 mg/ml β-CN, 667
and 833 µM pure PTX, 208 and 333 µM pure TQD, and
of β-CM with each of these drugs at the following molar
ratio of drug:β-CN, respectively: 16:1, 20:1 5:1, and 8:1,
were prepared in PBS containing 1.67% (v/v) DMSO.
Approximately 10 similar images of each of the samples
were collected in three independent experiments.

Where F and F0 are β-CN fluorescence intensity in
the presence and absence of the drug, respectively; [D] is
the drug concentration, V is the static quenching constant
and KSV is the Stern-Volmer overall quenching constant.
Data fitting was calculated using OriginPro 9.0 software
(OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).

Where WED is the amount of encapsulated drug,
WTD is the total amount of drug in the sample, WSD is the
amount of unencapsulated drug which sedimented and
was quantified in the centrifugation pellet and Wβ-CN is
the amount of the protein in the sample. Loading capacity
data analysis, used to estimate Lmax, was performed by
employing a nonlinear curve fitting with OriginPro 9.0,
according to the Langmuir equation:

Non-linear upward-curving of the Stern-Volmer
plots were observed indicating that both static and
dynamic quenching mechanisms take place during the
binding. Hence, association constant calculations were
made using the modified Stern-Volmer equation [55]:

ratios were studied using a DLS analyzer, NICOMP™
380 (Particle Sizing System (PSS), Inc., Santa Barbara,
CA, USA). Scattered light intensity was detected by an
Avalanche photo diode detector at a fixed angle of 90°.
The laser wavelength was 658 nm. Nicomp, mono-, bi-, or
tri-modal distributions were calculated from the scattered
light intensity fluctuations [3]. Samples were prepared in
PBS with 2.0% (v/v) DMSO. Measurements were made in
triplicates, and mean values and SE were calculated.

the protein containing supernatant was collected. Protein
concentration was determined using the Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein samples (10 µg)
were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide
gel containing SDS, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane and blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer
(Tris-buffered saline (TBS); 150  mM NaCl, 20  mM
Tris-base at pH 8.0, containing 1% skim milk and 0.5%
Tween 20). The blots were incubated with a mouse anti-Pgp monoclonal antibody, JSB-1 (1:100 dilution, overnight
at 4°C; kindly provided by Prof. R. J. Scheper and Dr. G.
L. Scheffer, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands). The blots were then rinsed three times
for 10 min each in washing buffer (TBS containing 0.5%
Tween 20) at RT and reacted with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution,
1 h at RT; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA, USA). Following three 10  min washes at
RT, detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence
(Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-HaEmek, Israel) was
recorded using an imaging analysis system (ImageQuant
LAS 4000, GE Healthcare). Actual protein loading was
confirmed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the
α-subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase, KETTY (1:3,000 dilution;
kindly provided by Prof. S. J. D. Karlish, Weizmann
Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) and detected with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15,000 dilution;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA,
USA).

Zeta potential analysis
Electrophoretic mobility was determined using
a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (ZEN3600) instrument (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). Zeta potential was
derived based on the Smoluchowski model (Applicable
when the ratio of particle size (a) to Debye length (κ1)
is >> 1 [57]. Here κ1≈2.15 nm and particle sizes (a) were
365  nm and 265  nm for PTX-β-CM and TQD-β-CM,
thus κa values were 170 and 123, respectively; i.e.
κa >> 1). Samples of 1 mg/ml (42 µM) β-CN, 250 µM
pure PTX, 167 µM pure TQD, and of β-CM with each
of these drugs at 6:1 and 4:1  drug:β-CN molar ratio,
respectively, were prepared in PBS containing 0.5% (v/v)
DMSO. Measurements were made in triplicates at 25°C,
the average value and SE were calculated.

Tissue culture
Human gastric carcinoma EPG85-257P cells and
their MDR subline EPG85-257RDB (overexpressing
P-gp), were generously provided by Prof. H. Lage (Charité
- Medicine University, Berlin, Germany). Cells were
cultured in Leibovitz L-15 medium, supplemented with
6.25 mg/l fetuin, 2.5 mg/l transferrin, 0.5 g/l D-glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Rehovot, Israel), 10% fetal calf
serum, 1% minimal essential vitamins, 1 mg/l glutamine,
80 IE/l insulin, 100  μg/ml penicillin, 100  units/ml
streptomycin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz BeitHaEmek, Israel) and 1.12 g/l NaHCO3 (Frutarom, Haifa,
Israel). The growth medium of the MDR subline was
supplemented with 2.5  μg/ml (4.4  µM) daunorubicin
(Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Rehovot, Israel). MDR cells were
grown in drug-free medium for a week prior to each
experiment.

Simulated gastric digestion (SGD)
SGD for the cytotoxicity experiments was performed
using the method described and at the optimal conditions
determined previously [21]. The drug concentration was
determined using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer.

Cytotoxicity assays
To determine cytotoxicity of PTX in the presence
and absence of 0.8 µM TQD, the DMSO solutions of the
free drugs and the drugs released by SGD were diluted
in complete growth medium. Cytotoxicity of undigested
PTX-β-CM was studied in serum-free medium (SFM)
due to competitive binding of hydrophobic drugs to
human serum albumin as previously described [21].
Our system is designed for oral delivery, hence, the
β-CM are not expected to come in contact with serum
albumin. Undigested β-CM were prepared by adding
a constant volume of different concentrations of PTX
or TQD in DMSO to a 5 mg/ml β-CN solution in PBS
while continuously stirring, to obtain a range of PTX
concentrations of: 15–1,250  µM and 4  µM TQD. The
samples were diluted 5-fold in SFM and equilibrated
overnight at 4°C before mixing them for the combination
experiments.

Quantification of P-gp expression by Western
blot analysis
P-gp expression was determined by Western
blot analysis. Membrane proteins were isolated using
lysis buffer containing 50  mM Tris pH 7.5,  50  mM
β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mM
EGTA and 1 mM EDTA. The extract was incubated on ice
for 1 h, centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min and

Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well
plates (100 µl/ well). Following a 24 h incubation, cells
were exposed to the different systems at increasing PTX
concentrations (0.1% (v/v) DMSO) for 1 h (to simulate
an average residence time in the stomach, which ranges
from 30 min to 4 h after food ingestion [58]), followed
by three washes with complete growth medium or PBS
(for the undigested systems) to remove the excess drug.
After an additional 48 h of incubation (to allow the drug
absorbed to act on the cells), cell viability was determined
using an XTT-based cell proliferation assay (Biological
Industries, Kibbutz Beit-HaEmek, Israel) [21]. Results
shown are means ± SE obtained from three independent
experiments, each performed in triplicates.
Cytotoxicity data were analyzed using a nonlinear
curve fitting of a sigmoidal model (Hill1) with OriginPro
9.0 for dose-response curve according to Equation (6)

Where P represents the percentage of live cells at
each drug concentration, P0 represents the maximal percent
of surviving cells in the absence of drug (100% = control),
P∞ represents the minimal percent of live cells at infinite
drug concentration (maximal response value characterized
by zero viability of cells), and [D] represents the drug
concentration; IC50 is the drug concentration exerting
50% inhibition of cell growth and n is the Hill slope
parameter for the abruptness of the dose-response curve.
The statistical analysis of variance of the calculated IC50
values was determined by an unpaired student’s t-test.
A P-value lower than 0.05 was considered as indicating
statistical significance.
