Abstract
Constitutive nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) activation is among
the many deregulated signaling pathways that are proposed to
drive pancreatic cancer cell growth and survival. Recent
reports suggest that glycogen synthase kinase-3B (GSK-3B)
plays a key role in maintaining basal NF-KB target gene
expression and cell survival in pancreatic cancer cell lines.
However, the mechanism by which GSK-3B facilitates constitutive NF-KB signaling in pancreatic cancer remains unclear.
In this report, we analyze the contributions of both GSK-3
isoforms (GSK-3A and GSK-3B) in regulating NF-KB activation
and cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1
and MiaPaCa-2). We show that GSK-3 isoforms are differentially required to maintain basal NF-KB DNA binding activity,
transcriptional activity, and cell proliferation in Panc-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells. Our data also indicate that IKB kinase (IKK)
subunits are not equally required to regulate pancreatic
cancer–associated NF-KB activity and cell growth. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that GSK-3 maintains
constitutive NF-KB signaling in pancreatic cancer by regulating IKK activity. These data provide new insight into GSK-3–
dependent NF-KB regulation and further establish GSK-3 and
IKK as potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated death in the United States, with a 5-year patient survival
rate of 5% (1). Moreover, an estimated 33,370 patients were
expected to die from this disease in 2007 (1). The dismal mortality
rate from pancreatic cancer stems from its aggressive metastatic
nature and its ability to resist conventional chemotherapies (2).
Therefore, expanding our knowledge of the complex molecular
pathways responsible for the development of pancreatic cancer is
critical for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Deregulated
nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)
signaling are among the many pathways that have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
NF-nB represents a family of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors consisting of five members: c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB, p50
(NF-nB1/p105 precursor), and p52 (NF-nB2/p100 precursor; ref. 3).

The most studied NF-nB complex consists of the p65/p50
heterodimer. In resting cells, NF-nB is rendered inactive within
the cytoplasm through association with inhibitory InB proteins.
Various inflammatory stimuli can trigger the activation of the InB
kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of a regulatory subunit
(IKKg) and two catalytic subunits (IKKa and IKKh; ref. 4). On IKK
activation, InB is phosphorylated and subsequently targeted for
rapid proteosomal degradation, thus liberating NF-nB for nuclear
translocation, enhanced DNA binding, and transcriptional
regulation (5).
Constitutive activation of NF-nB has been characterized in
numerous human cancers and is associated with regulating genes
that control cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis (6). Importantly, constitutive NF-nB activation has been
observed in 70% of human pancreatic cancers as well as in human
pancreatic cancer cell lines and animal models (7–9). Studies have
also shown constitutive IKK activity to play a key role in regulating
cell survival and cell cycle progression in multiple in vitro
pancreatic cancer models (8, 10). Thus, there has been growing
interest in using IKK as a chemotherapeutic target for pancreatic
cancer.
GSK-3 is a serine/theronine kinase that exists as two highly
similar mammalian isoforms (GSK-3a and GSK-3h; refs. 11, 12).
GSK-3 is recognized for its role in down-regulating h-catenin, thus
suppressing the transcriptional activity of T-cell–specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer factor complexes within the Wnt/hcatenin pathway (13). Numerous reports have subsequently shown
the involvement of this multifunctional kinase in regulating a
variety of transcription factors involved in cancer progression,
including NF-nB (13–18). A gsk-3b–deficient mouse model
provided the first evidence of GSK-3–dependent NF-nB regulation
(19). These data show that the loss of GSK-3h results in defective
NF-nB signaling in response to tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a).
Furthermore, we previously reported that GSK-3h specifies
promoter-specific recruitment of p65/RelA to NF-nB–dependent
genes in response to TNF-a (20). A previous report has also
implicated GSK-3h in playing a critical role in regulating
constitutive NF-nB reporter activity and target gene expression
within in vitro pancreatic cancer models (21). However, the
mechanism by which GSK-3h drives constitutive or inducible
NF-nB has not been characterized.
Despite the structural similarity between GSK-3a and GSK-3h,
evidence suggests that these isoforms are not functionally
redundant in regulating NF-nB (19, 22). In this report, we
characterize the individual roles that GSK-3 isoforms play in
maintaining constitutive NF-nB activity and cell proliferation in
pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2). We show that
both GSK-3 isoforms can function to regulate basal NF-nB DNA
binding and transcriptional activity, whereas GSK-3a predominantly controls cell growth and survival. Our data also show that
IKKa and IKKh exhibit different requirements to drive constitutive

GSK-3a/b Regulates IKK Activity in Pancreatic Cancer

NF-nB activity in a pancreatic cancer cell type dependent manner.
Additionally, we provide the first evidence that links GSK-3 to
constitutive IKK activity in pancreatic cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. Panc-1 (CRL-1496) and MiaPaCa-2 (CRL1420) pancreatic cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. Panc-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin/
streptomycin. MiaPaCa-2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 2.5% horse serum. Cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h before experimentation. All cell
culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The following antibodies
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: p65, p50, GSK-3a/h, htubulin, and glutathione S-transferase (GST). IKKa clone 14A231 and IKKh
clone10AG2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The
following antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology:
phospho-p65 (Ser536), phospho-glycogen synthase (Ser641), glycogen synthase, cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), and caspase-3. TNF-a was purchased
from Promega. GSK-3 inhibitors (AR-A014418 and SB216763) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. The IKKh inhibitor (compound A) was provided by
Bayer Healthcare.
Small RNA interference. The following small interfering RNAs (siRNA;
siGenome SMARTpool) were obtained from Dharmacon as a pool of four
annealed double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides: IKKa (M-003473-02),
IKKh (M-003503-03), GSK-3a (M-003009-01), and GSK-3h (M-003010-03),
plus nontargeting control #3 (D001201-03). In brief, cells were cultured to
70% confluency in six-well plates. Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent was
used to transfect 100 nmol/L siRNA according to the manufacturer’s
instruction.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and NF-KB DNA binding ELISA.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and NF-nB supershift analysis
were done on nuclear extracts as previously described (20) using 32P-labeled
oligonucleotide probe corresponding to an NF-nB site within the MHC class
I promoter region. Relative p65 DNA binding activity was quantified using
the TransAM NF-nB p65 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA binding activity was
measured in triplicate at 450-nm wavelength on a Versamax Microplate
Reader (Molecular Devices Corp.).
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared on ice using
Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as
previously described (23). Protein extracts were quantified by Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously
described (20).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium cellular proliferation assay. Cells were
seeded in triplicate at 3  103 per well (96-well plate) and cultured in the
presence or absence of GSK-3 or IKKh inhibitors at the indicated time
course. Alternatively, cells were transiently transfected with appropriate
siRNA and cultured at the indicated time points posttransfection. At the end
of each time point, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H -tetrazolium (MTS) compound (Promega)
was added and absorbance was read at 490 nm on a Versamax Microplate
Reader (Molecular Devices).
Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cells were seeded in triplicate at
2  104 per well (24-well plate), transfected with the appropriate siRNA as
described above, and cultured for 24 h. After siRNA transfection, cells were
cotransfected with 200 ng of luciferase reporter construct containing
tandem NF-nB binding sites from the MHC class I promoter region and
5 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase construct (Promega) using Fugene6
transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured for an
additional 24 h, harvested in passive lysis buffer, and analyzed according to
Dual-Luciferase Assay System protocol (Promega). Relative light units were
measured on an Lmax Microplate Luminometer (Molecular Devices) and
normalized to pRL-TK Renilla luciferase light units.

Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two micrograms of
RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was done and analyzed as
previously described (20) using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primerprobe sets (Applied Biosystems) for IjBa (Hs00153283_m1) and Bcl-xL
(Hs00236329_m1).
IKK kinase assay. Whole cell lysates were prepared on ice for 45 min in
lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mmol/L NaCl, 0.25%
Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1
protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 1 phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail 1 (Sigma-Aldrich). IKK complexes were immunoprecipitated from
500-Ag protein extract using an IKKa antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). An
in vitro kinase assay was done and analyzed as previously described (20).
GST-InBa substrate phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography and
quantitated using Image Quant version 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics).
Luminescence-based caspase-3/7 activity assay. Cells were plated in
triplicate at 2  103 per well in white-walled 96-well plates (Becton
Dickinson). Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA as described
above. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured at 48, 72, and 96 h posttransfection using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay uses a caspase-3/7
tetrapeptide DEVD substrate that produces a luminescent signal on
cleavage. Relative light units were measured on an Lmax Microplate
Luminometer (Molecular Devices).
Statistical analysis. Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used
for statistical analysis of data. An unpaired t test was used to evaluate
differences between group means. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
GSK-3 isoforms regulate constitutive NF-KB activity in
pancreatic cancer cells. A recent study emphasized the role that
GSK-3h plays in maintaining constitutive NF-nB reporter activity
and target gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells (21). However,
this report did not address the individual requirements of both
GSK-3 isoforms in regulating NF-nB. Furthermore, the mechanism
by which GSK-3 regulates NF-nB activity requires understanding.
Here we have analyzed constitutive NF-nB DNA binding and
transcriptional activity in two well-known in vitro pancreatic
carcinoma models (Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2). As shown in Fig. 1A,
constitutive NF-nB DNA binding activity is detected in Panc-1 cells
through EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts. This form of NF-nB
activity is shown to be the p65/p50 heterodimer through supershift
analysis (Fig. 1A). EMSA analysis of MiaPaca-2 cells showed
constitutive DNA binding of p65/p50 heterodimers as well as p50
homodimers (Fig. 1A). Cells were treated with two structurally
distinct pharmacologic inhibitors of both GSK-3 isoforms (ARA014418 and SB-216763) to determine a potential requirement of
GSK-3 in controlling constitutive NF-nB DNA binding activity.
Previously reported treatment duration and inhibitor concentrations (21) were used in our studies. Treatment with either GSK-3
inhibitor for 24 h at 15 and 25 Amol/L reduces p65/50 DNA binding
in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). DNA binding activity of p50 homodimers
was largely unaffected by GSK-3 inhibition in MiaPaCa-2 cells. To
ask whether direct inhibition of GSK-3 isoforms would affect NF-nB
constitutive DNA binding activity in pancreatic cancer cells, RNA
interference of GSK-3a and GSK-3h was used. Western blot analysis
confirms that GSK-3 RNA interference was isoform specific and
significantly reduced GSK-3 protein levels relative to nontargeting
siRNA control (Fig. 1C). Loss of either GSK-3 isoform reduced
constitutive NF-nB DNA binding in both cell lines (Fig. 1D).
Moreover, an ELISA-based DNA binding assay showed a significant

GSK-3 isoform (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine whether GSK-3 isoforms play roles in regulating
NF-nB transcriptional activity, we measured the effect of GSK-3
RNA interference on basal NF-nB-luciferase reporter activity. Our
data show that knockdown of either GSK-3 isoform resulted in a
significant reduction of constitutive NF-nB-luciferase reporter

activity in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined
whether GSK-3–dependent regulation of reporter activity corresponded with the expression of two NF-nB–regulated genes (IjBa
and Bcl-xL). Loss of GSK-3h alone and both GSK-3a/h significantly
suppressed expression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, knockdown
of either GSK-3 isoform alone or combined GSK-3a/h resulted
in reduced expression of IjBa (Fig. 2B). Ser536 phosphorylation of

the NF-nB subunit, p65/RelA, correlates with its transcriptional
activity (24). To determine whether the GSK-3 isoforms regulate
p65 phosphorylation, RNA interference was used. Extracts were
prepared from cells treated with control siRNA or siRNA for
either GSK-3 isoform. Consistent with the elevated NF-nB activity
in Panc-1 in MiaPaCa-2 cells, we also observe constitutive Ser536
phosphorylation of p65 (Fig. 2C). RNA interference of GSK-3a or
combined GSK-3a/h reduced p65 phosphorylation in Panc-1 cells
(Fig. 2C). Conversely, knockdown of GSK-3h had a greater effect on
basal p65 phosphorylation in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 2C). Taken
together, these data suggest that both GSK-3 isoforms play
individual roles in maintaining constitutive NF-nB DNA binding
and transcriptional activity in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.
GSK-3A promotes pancreatic cancer cell growth and
survival. Constitutive NF-nB activity has been reported to play
mitogenic and antiapoptotic roles in pancreatic cancer cell lines
(8, 9). Pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibition and GSK-3 RNA interference were used to determine a role for GSK-3 in controlling
proliferation and survival of Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.
Consistent with a previous report (21), GSK-3 inhibition (ARA014418) decreased growth of Panc-1 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (5, 15, and 30 Amol/L) over a 96-hour time course
(Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in MiaPaCa-2 cells (data
not shown). Next, we used RNA interference to determine the
individual requirements for GSK-3a and GSK-3h on cell viability.
We observed a significant reduction in Panc-1 cell growth
following GSK-3a RNA interference at 96 hours after siRNA
transfection when compared with nontargeting control and GSK3h siRNA (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed in MiaPaCa-2
cells (data not shown). Moreover, the knockdown of GSK-3a in
Panc-1 cells resulted in a significant reduction in the total
number of cells at 72 and 96 hours after siRNA transfection
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Western blot analysis confirmed
knockdown of GSK-3 isoforms at each time point after siRNA

transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly, we did not
observe complete GSK-3 knockdown until 72 and 96 hours after
siRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These data could
explain why the effects of GSK-3a knockdown were only seen at
later time points after siRNA transfection.
The induction of caspase-3 cleavage was also measured to
determine whether the loss of cell viability following the disruption
of GSK-3 was due to apoptosis. An increase in caspase-3 cleavage
following 30 Amol/L pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibition was observed
over 24 and 48 hours in Panc-1 (Fig. 3C). The efficiency of GSK-3
inhibition was indicated by the reduced basal phosphorylation of a
GSK-3 substrate, glycogen synthase at Ser461 (Fig. 3C). Moreover,
GSK-3a knockdown induced caspase-3 cleavage 48 hours posttransfection of siRNA (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed in
MiaPaCa-2 cells (data not shown). A luminescent caspase-3/7 assay
was used to confirm a significant increase in caspase activity
following the knockdown of GSK-3a or combined GSK-3a/h in
Panc-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Notably, pharmacologic GSK3 inhibition was more effective than GSK-3 knockdown in
suppressing cell growth and inducing caspase-3 cleavage. These
observations could indicate unknown off-target effects of pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibition (Fig. 3; see Discussion). Taken together,
we show that the loss of GSK-3a is more efficient than GSK-3h in
suppressing cell growth and survival in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.
Importantly, these observations correlate with the ability of GSK-3a
to regulate constitutive NF-nB activity.
Constitutive NF-KB activity in pancreatic cancer cells is IKK
dependent. In addition to the studies shown above relative to
GSK-3, studies have also shown IKK to be essential in regulating
constitutive NF-nB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells (8–10). To
confirm these findings, NF-nB DNA binding activity was analyzed
in the presence of an established small-molecule IKKh inhibitor
(compound A; ref. 25). Compound A treatment for 24 hours showed
dose-dependent suppression of constitutive NF-nB DNA binding

activity in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4A). We note that IKKh
inhibition is more effective in blocking constitutive NF-nB DNA
binding activity in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Next, RNA interference to IKKa
and IKKh was used to determine the individual requirements of
IKK subunits for constitutive NF-nB DNA binding activity and
transcriptional activation. The knockdown of IKK subunits was
specific and significantly reduced protein levels relative to
nontargeting siRNA control (Fig. 4B). We observed a decrease in
p65/p50 DNA binding activity following the knockdown of either
IKK subunit in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, knockdown
of IKKa alone or combined IKKa/h knockdown caused significant
loss of NF-nB DNA binding activity in Panc-1 cells (Fig. 4C). The
individual role that each IKK subunit plays in regulating basal NFnB transcriptional activity was measured by an NF-nB reporter
assay. RNA interference against either IKK subunit caused
substantial suppression of reporter activity in both Panc-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4D). However, the suppressive effects of IKKa
and combined IKKa/h knockdown were stronger than IKKh
knockdown alone (Fig. 4D). Thus, our data suggest that both IKK
subunits play a role in regulating constitutive NF-nB activity in
pancreatic cancer cells, but IKKa may play a more significant role
in Panc-1 cells.
IKK regulates pancreatic cancer cell growth and survival. To
determine the functional significance of NF-nB regulation by IKK
in pancreatic cancer cells, growth and survival were measured
following IKKh inhibition (compound A) or IKK RNA interference.
We showed that a higher concentration of compound A (5 Amol/L)
was required to significantly reduce Panc-1 cell growth (Fig. 5A).

However, MiaPaCa-2 cells were more sensitive to increasing
concentration of compound A, as shown by significant loss of cell
growth after 48-hour treatment at 1, 3, and 5 Amol/L (Fig. 5A).
These results are consistent with our previous observations of
compound A being more effective in suppressing constitutive
NF-nB DNA binding in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4A). Cell growth was
also measured in cells at 48, 72, and 96 hours posttransfection
of IKKa and IKKh siRNA. Furthermore, we used p65/RelA
RNA interference to test the dependency of NF-nB for cell
growth. In Panc-1 cells, loss of either IKK subunit or p65/RelA
significantly reduced cell growth 48 hours after siRNA transfection
(Fig. 5B). However, knockdown of IKKa and p65/RelA was more
effective in suppressing cell growth at the 72- and 96-hour time
points (Fig. 5B). In MiaPaCa-2 cells, knockdown of IKKa, IKKh, and
p65/RelA each resulted in a significant reduction in cell growth 96
hours after siRNA transfection (Fig. 5B). We note that MiaPaCa-2
cell growth is more sensitive to the loss of both IKK subunits,
whereas Panc-1 cell growth is more dependent on IKKa. Whereas
siRNA effects are not complete in their ability to knock down
individual proteins, these experiments show that the IKK subunits
and p65/RelA are involved in the growth and survival of pancreatic
cancer cells.
The induction of caspase-3 cleavage was also measured to
determine whether the reduction of cell growth following the
disruption of IKK was due to apoptosis. We observed a dosedependent increase in caspase-3 cleavage on 24-hour treatment
with compound A in Panc-1 cells (Fig. 5C). Similar results were
obtained with MiaPaCa-2 cells (data not shown). Additionally,

constructs for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate and indicated as percent activity relative to nontargeting control. Reporter activities from cells
transfected with IKK siRNA were all found to be significantly different relative to nontargeting control.

maximal caspase-3 cleavage was induced in Panc-1 cells following
knockdown of both IKKa and IKKh subunits (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity
following RNA interference against either IKKa or IKKh (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall, our data suggest that differential NF-nB
regulation by IKK subunits correlates with cell growth and survival
in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.

shown that loss of GSK-3 isoforms and IKK subunits suppresses
constitutive NF-nB activity, cell growth, and survival in Panc-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells. To determine whether GSK-3 regulates constitutive IKK activity in pancreatic cancer cells, the effects of
pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibition on IKK-dependent InBa phosphorylation were measured via an in vitro IKK kinase assay. Panc-1
cells were treated for 24 hours with GSK-3 inhibitor (AR-A014418)
at 25 and 50 Amol/L. Endogenous IKK complexes were immunoprecipitated with an IKKa-specific antibody. Immunoprecipitates
were incubated with GST-InBa, and an in vitro kinase reaction was

Figure 6. GSK-3 inhibition suppresses constitutive IKK kinase activity.
A, Panc-1 cells were treated with DMSO or GSK-3 inhibitor (AR-A014418) at
25 and 50 Amol/L for 24 h. As control, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-a
for 15 min. Whole cell extracts were harvested. IKKa antibody was used to
immunoprecipitate IKK complex. Kinase activities within immunocomplexes were
assayed following incubation with wild-type GST-InBa substrate in the presence
of [g-32P]ATP. Autoradiography was quantified and indicated as fold induction
relative to DMSO. Immunoblots were done against IKKa and GST to confirm
equal loading. B, Panc-1 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-a for 15 min or
transiently transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNA targeted against GSK-3a/h and
nontargeting control for 48 h. Whole cell extracts were harvested, separated

done. GSK-3 inhibition reduced phosphorylation of GST-InBa in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the basal phosphorylation status of InBa at Ser32/36 was measured in Panc-1 cells
following the knockdown of both GSK-3 isoforms. Consistent with
our in vitro kinase assay data, the loss of GSK-3 also resulted in a
reduction of endogenous InBa phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) and is
consistent with an inhibition of IKK activity. Notably, these data
provide the first evidence that GSK-3 regulates cancer cell–
associated NF-nB by maintaining IKK activity.

Discussion
GSK-3h has previously been reported to play an essential role in
maintaining constitutive NF-nB reporter activity and expression of
NF-nB target genes in pancreatic cancer cells (21). In this study, we
show that both GSK-3 isoforms function to regulate constitutive
NF-nB activity in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells. Although both GSK-3
isoforms contribute to regulating NF-nB activity, GSK-3a was
shown to be primarily required for cell growth (Fig. 3B ;
Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, the suppression in cell growth
following the loss GSK-3a may be due to increased apoptotic
signaling, as shown by an induction of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3D;
Supplementary Fig. S3). We note that pharmacologic inhibition of
GSK-3 was more effective than GSK-3a knockdown in suppressing
Panc-1 cell growth (Fig. 3A and B). Although the GSK-3 inhibitor
(AR-A014418) was not shown to affect a panel of closely related

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

protein kinases (26), unknown off-target effects cannot be ruled out
when interpreting growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells.
Importantly, we show that complete knockdown of GSK-3 and
significant growth suppression were not observed until later time
points after siRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2). These data
may also explain why GSK-3a siRNA was less effective in
suppressing cell growth relative to GSK-3 pharmacologic inhibition.
Overall, our data suggest that GSK-3 isoforms are not functionally
redundant in regulating NF-nB activity and cell growth in
pancreatic cancer cells.
InB kinases play a central role in regulating NF-nB signal
transduction. Therefore, efforts have been made in using IKK as a
therapeutic target to block constitutive NF-nB activity. In this
report, we use an IKKh-specific small-molecule inhibitor (compound A) that has been shown to be effective in blocking
constitutive (27) and inducible (25) NF-nB activity in various cell
lines. Our data show that compound A is also efficient in inhibiting
constitutive NF-nB activity (Fig. 4) and cell proliferation (Fig. 5) in
pancreatic cancer cells. In addition to IKKh inhibition, we show
that IKKa is the predominant regulator of constitutive NF-nB
activity and cell growth in Panc-1 (Figs. 4 and 5). Notably, higher
concentrations of the IKKh inhibitor (compound A) were required
to diminish Panc-1 cell growth. These data raise the possibility that
compound A may target IKKa at higher doses. Indeed, compound
A was shown to inhibit recombinant IKKa activity at higher
concentrations (K i for ATP, 135 nmol/L; ref. 25). Overall, we show
that the individual requirements for IKKa and IKKh for driving NFnB activity vary between Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells. These data
underscore the heterogeneity between pancreatic carcinoma cell
lines and prompt the need to understand the variety of oncogenic
mutations that potentiate NF-nB activity. Moreover, our results
emphasize the need for IKKa-specific small-molecule inhibitors to
target constitutive NF-nB activity in select pancreatic carcinoma
cell types.
The mechanism by which GSK-3 regulates constitutive NF-nB
activity in pancreatic cancer is not fully understood. Our data
suggest that GSK-3 and IKK may function together to regulate
constitutive NF-nB activity. Previous reports have speculated on
whether IKK is required for GSK-3–dependent NF-nB activity.
Analyses from our group and others provide evidence that GSK-3h
functions independent of the IKK complex during TNF-a–induced
NF-nB signaling (19, 20, 28). Moreover, GSK-3 was also suggested to
function independent of IKKh in pancreatic cancer cell lines (21).
In this regard, our current data show GSK-3–dependent regulation
of constitutive IKK activity in certain pancreatic cancer cell lines.
We show that inhibition (AR-A014418) or knockdown of both
GSK-3 isoforms suppressed constitutive IKK activity in Panc-1 cells
(Fig. 6). Notably, this abrogation in constitutive IKK activity
correlated with reduced NF-nB activity, cell growth, and survival.
Thus, we provide the first evidence that links GSK-3 and IKK in
constitutive NF-nB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.
Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive, metastatic disease
known for its dismal mortality rate. Despite current chemotherapeutic efforts to improve clinical prognosis, pancreatic cancer
still remains to be among the most drug-resistant tumors.
Consequently, there is growing interest on specifically targeting
deregulated signaling pathways that drive the molecular
pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. We emphasize in this report
the critical roles that GSK-3 and IKK play in maintaining
constitutive NF-nB signaling. Collectively, our data provide new
