Abstract
Although it has been shown that chemoradiotherapy may induce immunogenic cell death, which could trigger
T-cell immunity mediated by high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and calreticulin, there is still limited
information to support this theory directly in a clinical setting. In the present study, we evaluated antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell responses against six cancer-testis antigens in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) receiving chemoradiation. Expression of HMGB1 and calreticulin within tumor
microenvironment was also analyzed in resected samples with and without chemoradiotherapy in relation to
patients survival. Tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses were conﬁrmed in six (38%) of 16 patients with ESCC
after chemoradiotherapy coexisting with elevated serum HMGB1. In addition, HMGB1 within tumor microenvironment was signiﬁcantly upregulated in patients with ESCC with preoperative chemoradiotherapy, but not in
those without chemoradiotherapy, and the degree of HMGB1 positively correlated with patient survival (n ¼ 88).
Both irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs induced upregulation of HMGB1 and calreticulin in nine ESCC cell
lines. Furthermore, HMGB1 was able to induce maturation of dendritic cells. Together, our ﬁndings indicate that
chemoradiation induces tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses, and HMGB1 production is related to clinical
outcome after chemoradiation. Cancer Res; 72(16); 3967–76. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is well known
to be sensitive to radiotherapy and its combination with
chemotherapy was proven to have clinical beneﬁts (1, 2). It
is generally accepted that irradiation is able to directly induce
apoptosis or necrosis against ESCC and various strategies of
radiotherapy, such as hyperfractionated irradiation (3) and
image-guided radiotherapy (4), to enhance direct cytotoxic and
cytostatic effects against ESCC through radiation oncology (5,
6). However, there is accumulating evidence to support the
novel concept that radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy
may induce immunogenic cell death, which could trigger
uptake of antigenic components by dendritic cells (DC) and

transfer antigenic signals to T-cell–mediated immunity, resulting in the expansion of antigen-speciﬁc CTLs and production
of tumor-speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in murine
models (7–14). It has been shown that the collaboration
between the direct effects of irradiation and enhanced
tumor-speciﬁc immunity induced by the irradiation could
reject inoculated live tumors in murine models, where irradiation alone was not able to reject tumors (7, 8). Important
mediators that induce immunogenic cell death include highmobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and calreticulin
induced by chemoradiation. For example, HMGB1 released
from tumor cells treated with chemoradiation could enhance
engulfment of antigenic components by DCs through Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) and mediate cross-presentation of tumor
antigens into CD4 and CD8 T cells (7–13). Also, early membrane exposure of calreticulin induced by irradiation could
enhance phagocytosis of dying tumor cells by DCs (13, 15, 16),
and calreticulin is related to autophagy-dependent anticancer
immune responses induced by chemotherapeutic agents (17).
However, there is limited information describing whether
immunogenic cell death could be induced by radiotherapy
and/or chemotherapy in clinical settings, probably due to the
lack of accurate assay systems to evaluate antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell responses in patients with cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy. We have recently identiﬁed several novel HLA
class I–restricted epitopes presented on ESCC and recognized
by tumor-speciﬁc T cells through the genome-wide approach
(18–20). Our gene expression proﬁle data indicated that

cancer-testis antigens such as TTK protein kinase (TTK),
lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus K (LY6K), cell division
cycle associated 1 (CDCA1), 34 kDa translocase of the outer
mitochondrial membrane (TOMM34), hypoxia-inducible protein 2 (HIG2), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II mRNA–
binding protein 3 (IMP3) were highly expressed in ESCC (18–
25). Peptides derived from these cancer-testis antigens could
stimulate CTL that recognize and kill ESCC cells endogenously
expressing these antigens (18, 19, 23). Furthermore, we have
established a reliable in vitro assay system using peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) to detect tumor-speciﬁc CTL
responses against the panels of HLA class I epitopes derived
from these cancer-testis antigens (18, 19). Therefore, it is
possible to analyze antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses induced
by chemoradiotherapy and evaluate the phenomenon immunogenic cell death in patients with ESCC receiving chemoradiotherapy. There is, to our knowledge, no previous report
to directly prove antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses following
chemoradiotherapy in clinical settings.
In the present study, we evaluated (i) whether chemoradiotherapy could induce antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses in
patients with ESCC, (ii) whether chemoradiotherapy could
upregulate HMGB1 and calreticulin in in vivo and in vitro
settings, and (iii) whether expression of HMGB1 and calreticulin correlate to clinical outcomes.

Patients and Methods
Patients and samples
Study group 1. Sixteen HLA-A2402(þ) or HLA-A0201(þ)
patients with histologically diagnosed primary ESCC who
were treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology,
Gunma University and the First Department of Surgery, University of Yamanashi Hospital were enrolled in this study.
Patients with ESCC receiving chemoradiotherapy (15 men and
1 woman, 64.5  10.2 years old) were 4 patients in stage II,
6 patients in stage III, and 6 patients in stage IV according
to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation for
esophageal cancers (UICC, 5th edition). None of the patients
had received any treatment before this study. Enrolled patients
received deﬁnitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy [2 Gy 
30–33 ¼ total 60–66 Gy and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU)/CDGP or
CDDP/docetaxel-based chemotherapy]. To evaluate the tumor
antigen–speciﬁc T-cell response after chemoradiation, PBLs
were taken from patients during prechemoradiotherapy
periods (within 1 week before chemoradiotherapy), during
chemoradiotherapy (21  3 days after the initiation of
chemoradiotherapy), postchemoradiotherapy day 3 (within
3 days after the termination of chemoradiotherapy), and
postchemoradiotherapy day 30 (30  3 days after the termination of chemoradiotherapy). PBLs were isolated with FicollPaque Plus (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences), density gradient
solution, and frozen in aliquots. This study and the use of all
clinical materials were approved by the individual Institutional Ethical Committees, and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Study group 2. Formalin-embedded tumor samples from
a total of 88 patients with ESCC were evaluated in study

group 2. The clinical background of patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy (n ¼ 45, 40 Gy irradiation þ concurrent 5Fu/CDDP/docetaxel chemotherapy) and patients
without preoperative chemoradiotherapy (n ¼ 43) were shown
in Supplementary Table S1. This study and the use of all clinical materials were approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee, University of Yamanashi (Yamanashi, Japan), and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Cell lines and transfection
ESCC cell lines, TE-1, TE-2, TE-3, TE-4, and TE-5 were
obtained from the University of Tohoku cell bank (Institute
of Development, Aging and Cancer, University of Tohoku,
Sendai, Japan). ESCC cell lines, KYSE-30, KYSE-50, KYSE-70,
and KYSE110 were purchased from the Health Science
Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). COS-7 cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The
experiments were carried out within less than 6 months after
receipt from the cell bank. Cell lines were regularly authenticated and matched short tandem repeat DNA proﬁles of the
original cell lines in each cell bank. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 U/mL
penicillin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
COS-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing TTK,
LY6K, IMP3, CDCA1, TOMM34, and HIG2 in the combination of
HLA-A2402 or HLA-A0201 using FuGENE6 (Roche) reagents
(18). Thereafter, 3  105 cells per well were incubated in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Sigma) with
10% FCS and 1% anti-mycobiotics (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well
ﬂat bottom plates (Becton Dickinson Labware). Two days after
culture, cells were used as target cells in enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays as described later.
In vitro T-cell culture and ELISPOT assay
In study group 1, PBLs (5  105 cells per well) obtained from
different time points were simultaneously thawed and cultured
in X-VIVO15 medium with 100 U/mL rIL-2 (Peprotech) in 48well ﬂat bottom plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) for 14 days
without any antigen stimulation. On day 15, cultured cells were
subjected to ELISPOT assays as responder cells.
To detect the antigen-speciﬁc T-cell response, an ELISPOT
assay was conducted with the human IFN-g ELISPOT kit
(Mabtech). Ninety-six–well plates with nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) were precoated with primary anti-IFN-g
antibody (1-D1K) at 4 C overnight. Plates were then prereacted
with X-VIVO15 containing 1% human serum albumin (SigmaAldrich). COS-7 cells (2  103 per well) transfected with
individual genes (see earlier) and responder cells (2  103 per
well) were mixed and incubated in a ﬁnal volume of 200 mL
per well of X-VIVO15 for 24 hours in triplicate. Cell mixtures
were treated with biotinylated secondary anti-IFN-g antibody
(7-B6-1) and incubated for 2 hours. Plates were then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase reagent and stained with TMB
(Mabtech). Spots were quantiﬁed with the autoanalyzing
system, KS ELISPOT Compact (ZEISS). Antigen-speciﬁc
spots were the average of triplicates by subtracting target
wells transfected with HLA-A molecule alone from target wells
transfected with HLA-A molecule þ tumor antigen molecules.

Antigen-Speciﬁc T-cell Response following Chemoradiotherapy

Positivity of the tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell response was
deﬁned when the number of antigen-speciﬁc spots was 200.
We deﬁned the assessable lower limit of spots per well as 20
spots.
Immunohistochemistry
In study group 2, HMGB1-, calreticulin-, CD8- and Foxp3immunostainings were conducted using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. For HMGB1 and calreticulin, each
parafﬁn section was dewaxed, followed by antigen retrieval
with Target Retrieval Solution (10 mmol citrate buffer at pH
6.0; Dako) in an autoclave (121 C, 15 minutes). Sections were
cooled at room temperature for 30 minutes and endogenous
peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter, sections were incubated with diluted normal blocking
serum for 20 minutes and incubated with rabbit anti-human
HMGB1 mAb (Clone 2F6, Sigma-Aldrich, 3 mg/mL) overnight
at 4 C or with mouse anti-human calreticulin mAb (Abcam,
5 mg/mL) for 2 hours at 37 C. Thereafter, peroxidase-linked
secondary antibodies (Dako) and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB)
were used to detect speciﬁc binding.
For Foxp3 staining, each parafﬁn section was dewaxed,
followed by antigen retrieval with Epitope Retrieval Solution
(10 mmol citrate buffer at pH 6.0, Dako) in a preheated water
bath (98 C, 40 minutes), and endogenous peroxidase was
blocked by Chemmate Peroxidase Blocking Solution (Dako).
Then, biotinylated anti-human Foxp3 mAb (diluted by PBS at
1:20; eBioscience) was applied for 40 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter, peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies
and DAB were used to detect speciﬁc binding.
For CD8 staining, each parafﬁn section was dewaxed, followed by antigen retrieval with Target Retrieval Solution (10
mmol citrate buffer at pH 6.0; Dako) with an autoclave (121 C,
15 minutes). The sections were cooled at room temperature for
30 minutes and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3%
hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter, the sections were incubated
with diluted normal blocking serum for 20 minutes, and incubated with diluted anti-human-CD8-mAb, Clone C8/144B
(Dako), overnight at 4 C. Thereafter, peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and DAB were used to detect speciﬁc binding.
Quantitative evaluation of HMGB1- and calreticulin (membranous þ intracellular)-positive cancer cells and tumor-inﬁltrating CD8- and Foxp3-positive cells was carried out in serial
sections using 5 randomly selected areas at a magniﬁcation of
400 by 2 observers (S. Izawa and K. Kono) in a blinded
manner. The grade of HMGB1 and calreticulin expression was
classiﬁed into HMGB1-strong and HMGB1-weak or calreticulin-strong and calreticulin-weak groups based on the median
value of the counts of positive cancer cells.
In vitro treatments of ESCC with irradiation and
chemotherapeutic agents
Nine ESCC cell lines (8  104/mL), TE-1, TE-2, TE-3, TE-4,
TE-5, KYSE-30, KYSE-50, KYSE-70, and KYSE110 were incubated with 5% RPMI medium in 48-well plates and treated with
10 Gy irradiation on days 1, 2, and 3 (total ¼ 30 Gy) or with
combination chemotherapy of 5FU (2.5–10 ng/mL) þ CDDP
(5–20 ng/mL) þ docetaxel (25–100 ng/mL) on day 1. Dying cells

www.aacrjournals.org

were analyzed by Annexin-V (BD Pharmingen) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; BD Pharmingen) by ﬂow cytometry, and
the proportion of dying cells was determined by either
Annexin-V (þ) or 7-AAD (þ) cells. Supernatants of treated
ESCC cultures were measured for HMGB1 contents by ELISA
(Shinotest) and cell surface expression of calreticulin was
evaluated by ﬂow cytometry with R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated anti-calreticulin mAb (Enzo life Sciences).
Treatment of DCs with HMGB1
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy
volunteers (n ¼ 5) were separated by a Ficoll-Paque Plus
density gradient, and monocytes were separated from PBMCs
by plastic adherences. Monocytes (3.0  105/mL) were cultured
in 6-well ﬂat bottom plates (Becton Dickinson Biosciences)
with 500 units/mL of granulocyte macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Peprotech EC) and 500 units/mL of
interleukin (IL)-4 (Peprotech) in X-VIVO. On day 5, immature
DCs were treated with recombinant HMGB-1 (10 mg/mL, R&D
Systems) or 10 mg/mL of OK-432 (Chugai). On day 7, immature
DCs, HMGB1-treated DCs, and OK-432–treated DCs were
analyzed with ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using
anti-human HLA-ABC ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) mAb
(eBioscience), FITC-mouse anti-human HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ
mAb (BD Pharmingen), FITC-mouse anti-human CD80 mAb
(BD Pharmingen), APC-mouse anti-human CD83 mAb (BD
Pharmingen), and PE-mouse anti-human CD86 mAb (BD
Pharmingen).
Statistical analysis
Differences between values were determined using the
paired and nonpaired Student t test. Overall survival (OS),
which was measured in days from surgery to death or from
chemoradiotherapy to death, was analyzed by the Kaplan–
Meier method, and statistical differences were analyzed by the
log-rank method. All statistical analyses were conducted with
SPSS statistics 17.0 (SPSS Inc.). Signiﬁcance was considered at
P < 0.05.

Results
Antigen-speciﬁc T-cell response after
chemoradiotherapy
In study group 1, PBLs obtained from before, during, and
after chemoradiotherapy were cultured for 14 days in vitro and
cultured T cells were subjected to an IFN-g ELISPOT assay as
responder cells.
As shown in Fig. 1A, a representative ELISPOT assay [case 10,
HLA-A0201 (þ) and HLA-A2402 ()] indicated that in vitro
cultured T cells from postchemoradiation day 3 signiﬁcantly
reacted with COS transfected with IMP3 þ HLA-A0201 or
CDCA1 þ HLA-A0201 and did not in those transfected with
HLA-A0201 alone. In summarized data from case 10 at different
time points, antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses were signiﬁcantly induced against COS transfected with IMP3, CDCA1,
TOMM34, and HIG2 in combination with HLA-A0201 during
chemoradiotherapy (Fig. 1B), whereas there was no speciﬁc
T-cell response before chemoradiotherapy. These antigen-

speciﬁc T-cell responses tended to last until postchemoradiation day 3, although these speciﬁcities diminished postchemoradiation day 30 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, there was no speciﬁc
T-cell response against COS transfected with target genes þ
HLA-A2402 before and after chemoradiation, in line with the
patient being HLA-A2402 negative (Fig. 1B). Thus, the results

being HLA-A0201–negative (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, the results of 6 (38%) of 16 patients in study
group 1 revealed that antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses were
signiﬁcantly induced by chemoradiotherapy (Table 1). When
OS was compared between the patients with (n ¼ 6) and

Serum HMGB1 levels after chemoradiotherapy
Because HMGB1 is thought to be one of the mediators
linking chemoradiation-induced cell death to antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell responses, serum HMGB1 levels (n ¼ 14) were evaluated
before and after chemoradiotherapy (postchemoradiation day
3) in study group 1. As shown in Fig. 2A, increased levels of
HMGB1 were signiﬁcantly observed after chemoradiotherapy,

whereas there was no detectable level of HMGB1 before
chemoradiotherapy. There was no signiﬁcant correlation
between the amount of serum HMGB1 at postchemoradiation
day 3 and number of spot-forming cells in ELISPOT assay
against each antigen, which is corresponding to the grade of
tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses (Supplementary Fig.
S2). However, when the amount of serum HMGB1 was compared between the patients with and without antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell responses following chemoradiation, the level of HMGB1
in the patients with antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses was
signiﬁcantly elevated in comparison to that in the patients
without antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses (18.1  14.1 vs. 5.1 
4.9 ng/mL, Fig. 2B), suggesting that HMGB1 produced by
chemoradiation play an important role in inducing systemic
tumor antigen- speciﬁc T-cell responses.

HMGB1 and calreticulin expression induced by
chemoradiotherapy
To evaluate HMGB1 and calreticulin expression within
tumor microenvironments induced by chemoradiotherapy,
immunohistochemical analysis was conducted in resected
tumor samples from study group 2 between patients with
(n ¼ 45) and without preoperative chemoradiotherapy (n ¼
43). There was no difference in the background of patients
except for the grade of lymph node dissection (Supplementary
Table S1).
Representative immunostainings using anti-HMGB1 and
anti-calreticulin mAbs in serial sections are shown in Fig. 3.
The grade of HMGB1 and calreticulin expression was classiﬁed
into HMGB1-strong (Fig. 3A) and HMGB1-weak (Fig. 3B) or
calreticulin-strong (Fig. 3B) and calreticulin-weak (Fig. 3A)

groups based on the median value of the counts of positive
tumor cells. Of note, the proportion of HMGB1-strong patients
was signiﬁcantly more predominant in the group with preoperative chemoradiotherapy than that without preoperative
chemotherapy (Table 2). On the other hand, the distribution
of calreticulin-strong and calreticulin-weak did not differ
between groups with and without preoperative chemoradiotherapy (Table 2). Thus, it is suggested that chemoradiation
upregulated HMGB1 expression, but not calreticulin expression, more progressively in tumor microenvironments with
ESCC.
To further evaluate the signiﬁcance of HMGB1 in relation to
T-cell immunity, the tumor-inﬁltrating grade of CD8- and
regulatory T-cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in
serial sections and compared between HMGB1-strong and
-weak groups. Representative immunostainings using antiCD8 and anti-Foxp3 mAbs are shown in Fig. 3A and B. As
shown in Fig. 4B, summarized data indicated that there was a
tendency of increased inﬁltrating CD8 (þ) cells in the HMGB1strong group (189  92 cells per ﬁeld) in comparison to those in
the HMGB-weak group (140  62 cells per ﬁeld), although the
difference did not reach a signiﬁcant level (P ¼ 0.065). There
was no difference in the inﬁltrating grade of regulatory T cells
(Foxp3-positive cells) between HMGB1-strong and -weak
groups (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when the inﬁltrating grade of CD8
(þ) cells was compared between the calreticulin-strong and
-weak groups, there was no signiﬁcant difference (153  79 vs.
149  89 cells per ﬁeld, respectively).

and KYSE110 did not produce HMGB1 even though these cell
lines underwent cell death by irradiation (the proportion of
Annexin-V (þ) or 7-AAD (þ) cells were 75%–95%). Similarly,
chemotherapeutic drugs induced different levels of HMGB1
production among 9 ESCCs, however, the production levels of
HMGB1 were relatively less than those induced by irradiation
regardless of almost the same amount of dying cells (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. S3).
With respect to calreticulin expression, both irradiation and
chemodrugs could upregulate surface calreticulin more than
the nontreatment controls (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). As
shown in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3, irradiation could
upregulate calreticulin depending on the cell line, for example,
TE4 and KYSE30 revealed increased levels of calreticulin after
irradiation, whereas the others did not show a dramatic
upregulation. Again, chemodrugs could induce increased calreticulin expression among 9 ESCCs, however, upregulated

Thus, upregulation of HMGB1 may be one of the phenotypes
of ESCC with better survival.
In vitro treatment of ESCC with anticancer drugs or
irradiation
To further evaluate HMGB1 and calreticulin expression
following irradiation and chemotherapy, 9 ESCC tumor cell
lines were treated with 30 Gy irradiation or a combination of
5FU þ CDDP þ docetaxel in vitro and, the production of
HMGB1 and surface expression of calreticulin, along with the
proportion of dying cells, were analyzed. There was no significant amount of HMGB1 in supernatants from any ESCC
without irradiation or chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig.
S3). As shown in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3, irradiation
could induce variable levels of HMGB1 production depending
on the cell line, for example, TE2 and KYSE70 produced
substantial amounts of HMGB1 after irradiation whereas TE4

levels of calreticulin were relatively less than those induced by
irradiation regardless of almost the same amount of dying cells
(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3).
Taken together, although both irradiation and chemodrugs
could induce upregulation of HMGB1 and calreticulin on
ESCCs, there were remarkable variations of the amounts
increased depending on cell lines. Interestingly, irradiation
could upregulate HMGB1 and calreticulin more remarkably
than chemotherapeutic drugs regardless of almost the same
amount of dying cells.
Maturation of DCs treated by HMGB1
To conﬁrm whether HMGB1 could maturate DCs, which is a
crucial step for induction of antigenic T-cell responses, monocyte-derived immature DCs were treated with HMGB1 and
their maturation markers were evaluated by ﬂow cytometry.
Representative data from 5 different donors indicated that
increased expression of maturation markers such as MHC class
I, CD83, and CD86 on DCs was seen after treatment with
HMGB1 in comparison to immature DCs, and the increased
levels after treatment with HMGB1 were slightly less than
mature DCs treated by OK-432 (ref. 26; Supplementary Fig. S5).
These observations were conﬁrmed in 5 independent experiments from different donors.

Discussion
The present study contains novel ﬁndings to support the
concept of immunogenic cell death induced by chemoradiotherapy in patients with ESCC. First, tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses were conﬁrmed in 6 (38%) of 16 patients
with ESCC following chemoradiotherapy. Second, the serum
level of HMGB1 following chemoradiation in the patients with

3974

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses was signiﬁcantly elevated in
comparison to that in the patients without antigen-speciﬁc Tcell responses. Third, upregulation of HMGB1 within tumor
microenvironments was signiﬁcantly related to preoperative
chemoradiotherapy and the degree of HMGB1 positively correlated with patients' survival. Fourth, both irradiation and
chemodrugs could induce upregulation of HMGB1 and calreticulin on ESCC cell lines in vitro. Finally, HMGB1 was able to
induce maturation of DCs in an in vitro culture system.
In general, chemoradiotherapy is thought to induce an
immunosuppressive state in both T-cell and natural killer-cell
immunity and there has been a general consensus that systemic immunity in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy was
severely impaired, leading to infectious complications and
growth of residual tumors (27, 28). Also, many chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy mediated their cytotoxic effects
by the induction of apoptosis, and this apoptosis was generally
considered to be noninﬂammatory and nonimmunogenic (29,
30). However, it has been recently shown that danger signals
from dying cells treated by some chemotherapeutic drugs, such
as oxaliplatin, or radiotherapy could induce TLR-dependent,
antigen-speciﬁc T-cell immunity, as it has been shown that
chemoradiation could not reject inoculated live tumors in
tlr4/ mice, whereas chemoradiation could reject the tumors
in wild-type mice (7, 8). Furthermore, among various danger
signals released from dying cells in the tumor-bearing mouse
model, HMGB1, but not other known TLR4 ligands, could be a
mandatory factor to induce tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell
immunity (7, 8). It has also been shown that HMGB1 released
from radiation-induced tumor cell death could enhance
engulfment of antigenic components by DCs through TRL4
and mediate cross-presentation of tumor antigens into CD4

Antigen-Speciﬁc T-cell Response following Chemoradiotherapy

and CD8 T cells, effectively leading to tumor antigen–speciﬁc
T-cell responses in murine model (7, 8). In the present study, we
showed for the ﬁrst time in a human clinical study that tumor
antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses were induced in patients
with ESCC following chemoradiation along with elevated
HMGB1 in patients' serum. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical study clearly indicated that HMGB1 production
within tumor microenvironments was signiﬁcantly related to
preoperative chemoradiotherapy and the degree of HMGB1
positively correlated with patients' survivals. Furthermore,
inﬁltrating grade of CD8(þ) T cells within tumor
microenvironments tended to be upregulated in HMGB1
high-expressing group. Taken together, these observations in
clinical settings strongly support the fact that immunogenic
cell death is induced by chemoradiotherapy in patients with
ESCC and HMGB1 is one of the important mediators linking
chemoradiation-induced cell death to antigen-speciﬁc T-cell
responses.
Moreover, it has been shown that early membrane exposure
of calreticulin induced by radiation could enhance phagocytosis of dying tumor cells by DCs in vitro (13, 15, 16), and both
HMGB1 release and calreticulin cell surface expression are
required for antigen-speciﬁc T-cell response in murine model.
However, we could not show any signiﬁcant differences in
calreticulin expression between patients with and without
chemoradiation, and there was no survival difference between
calreticulin-strong and -weak groups. Moreover, the inﬁltrating grade of CD8(þ) T cells did not differ between calreticulinstrong and -weak groups. Thus, there is a discrepancy between
murine model and clinical setting in terms of signiﬁcance of
calreticulin expression in relation to T-cell immunity or in
relation to chemoradiotherapy. There is one possible explanation that we classiﬁed both membranous and intracellular
staining as a positive case by immunohistochemistry in the
present study, as differentiation of staining pattern between
membranous and intracellular was difﬁcult in the immunohistochemical setting of clinical samples. Obeid and colleagues
previously reported that membranous expression of calreticulin was more relevant than intracellular global expression
when immunogenic tumor cell death occurred in murine
model (16). Further study with different methodology to
evaluate the cell surface expression of calreticulin in clinical
samples will be needed.
Of interest, we showed that chemoradiation could induce
upregulation of HMGB1 with signiﬁcant variations among
patients with ESCC in study group 2, and patients with high
HMGB1 expression had better OS than patients with weak
HMGB1 expression. Also, the in vitro study indicated that there
were substantial variations in HMGB1 production following
chemoradiation depending on ESCC cell lines regardless of
almost the same amount of dying cells. These observations
suggest that immune reactions related to HMGB1 production

following chemoradiation may affect clinical outcomes in
patients with ESCC. Apetoh and colleagues reported that
patients with breast cancer with a TLR4 loss-of-function allele
relapse more quickly after chemotherapy and radiotherapy
than those with a normal TLR4 allele (8), indicating a clinically
relevant immune reaction triggered by chemotherapy-induced
cell death. Thus, these observations strongly indicated that the
HMGB1-related immune response after chemoradiotherapy
may play an important and critical role in clinical outcome of
cancer treatments, and parameters such as HMGB1 expression
and TLR polymorphism may be able to predict clinical outcome after chemoradiation.
There are some debates about the capability of HMGB1 to
mature DCs. It has been shown that HMGB1 has an ability to
promote DC activation and trigger DC migration in human DC
in vitro (31), in line with our present study. On the contrary,
Apetoh and colleagues reported there was no clear evidence
that HMGB1 is required for the maturation of human DCs in
immunogenic tumor cell death system (8). The discrepancy
may be explained by the different protocol of DC-induction and
-maturation including dose and timing of HMGB1. The exact
mechanism by which HMGB1-TLR4 interactions affect the
tumor antigen presentation on DCs in immunogenic tumor
cell death has not been clariﬁed yet.
In conclusion, the present study strongly indicated that
tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell responses were induced following chemoradiation and HMGB1 production is related to
clinical outcome after chemoradiation.
