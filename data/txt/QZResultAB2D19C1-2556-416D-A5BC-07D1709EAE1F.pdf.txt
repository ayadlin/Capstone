Abstract

Author Manuscript

Deregulation of the Ras–mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an early event in
many different cancers and a key driver of resistance to targeted therapies1. Sustained signalling
through this pathway is caused most often by mutations in K-Ras, which biochemically favours
the stabilization of active RAF signalling complexes2. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a MAPK
scaffold3–5 that is subject to allosteric regulation through dimerization with RAF6,7. Direct
targeting of KSR could have important therapeutic implications for cancer; however, testing this
hypothesis has been difficult owing to a lack of small-molecule antagonists of KSR function.
Guided by KSR mutations that selectively suppress oncogenic, but not wild-type, Ras signalling,
we developed a class of compounds that stabilize a previously unrecognized inactive state of KSR.
These compounds, exemplified by APS-2-79, modulate KSR-dependent MAPK signalling by
antagonizing RAF heterodimerization as well as the conformational changes required for
phosphorylation and activation of KSR-bound MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase).
Furthermore, APS-2-79 increased the potency of several MEK inhibitors specifically within Rasmutant cell lines by antagonizing release of negative feedback signalling, demonstrating the
potential of targeting KSR to improve the efficacy of current MAPK inhibitors. These results
reveal conformational switching in KSR as a druggable regulator of oncogenic Ras, and further
suggest co-targeting of enzymatic and scaffolding activities within Ras–MAPK signalling
complexes as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming Ras-driven cancers.

Ras is the most frequently mutated human oncogene. Yet, despite recent breakthroughs,
therapeutic options to target Ras-dependent cancers remain limited1. Studies conducted in
several different model systems support the possibility of Ras-targeted interventions via
KSR3–5,8–10. However, due to its status as a pseudokinase and role as a non-catalytic
regulator of core signalling enzymes11–13, pharmacological approaches that target KSR have
been lacking. This is in contrast to current drug discovery and development efforts that have
focused extensively on direct inhibitors of the Ras effector kinases RAF, MEK, and ERK14.

Author Manuscript

To explore an alternative form of pharmacological modulation and identify Ras–MAPK
antagonists via KSR, we focused on large forward genetic screens conducted in flies and
worms that identified mutant Ras-selective suppressor alleles in KSR3–5. The studies in flies
alone eval uated approximately 900,000 randomly mutated strains searching for genetic
modifiers of a Ras(G12V)-dependent rough-eye phenotype15. We mapped the suppressor
alleles onto the primary sequence of KSR (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and a recently determined
X-ray crystal structure of the human KSR2 pseudokinase domain in complex with MEK1
and ATP, and noted a high concentration of suppressor mutations immediately adjacent to
the KSR ATP-binding pocket (Fig. 1a). On the basis of this analysis, we hypothesized that
the RAF and MEK interaction interfaces in KSR may be uncoupled through ligands that
engage the KSR ATP-binding pocket. Specifically, we speculated that small molecules,
which bias KSR towards a state similar to that revealed in the KSR2–MEK1–ATP crystal
structure, might function as antagonists of KSR-dependent regulation of RAF and MEK.

Author Manuscript

To identify active-site-directed ligands of KSR, we screened a collection of 176 structurally
diverse kinase inhibitors for direct competition of an activity-based probe (ATPbiotin) that
specifically labels the ATP-binding pocket of purified KSR2–MEK1 complexes (Fig. 1b, c).
From this analysis we identified APS-1-68-2 as a competitor of probe-labelling of KSR2–
MEK1. This quinazoline–biphenyl ether compound has previously been described as both a
Src and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family kinase inhibitor. Synthetic tailoring
of APS-1-68-2 generated highly informative structure–activity relationships (Fig. 1d). For
example, deletion of the terminal phenyl group (APS-1-82-1) or extension of the ether linker
(APS-2-12) diminished KSR2–MEK1 probe competition. Notably, addition of a single
methyl group at the internal phenyl generated a potent probe compound (APS-2-79; IC50 of
KSR2 = 120 ± 23 nM), whereas the similar dimethyl substituted com pound (APS-3-77) was
essentially inactive (IC50 of KSR2 > 10,000 nM).

Author Manuscript

To assess the biological function of these compounds as Ras–MAPK pathway antagonists,
we developed a simplified cell-based reconstitution system to directly monitor KSR-driven
MAPK signalling (Fig. 1e). This system, in which cellular MAPK signalling is dependent on
KSR expression, was found to be sensitive to known Ras suppressor mutations in KSR (Fig.
1f). Likewise, APS-2-79 also suppressed KSR-stimulated MEK and ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 1g; P < 0.005 lanes 1 versus 2). The suppression of MAPK signalling by APS-2-79
was dependent on direct targeting of KSR as an active site mutant (KSR(A690F)), which has
previously been demonstrated to stimulate KSR-based MAPK outputs independent of ATPbinding16, significantly diminished the activity of APS-2-79 (Fig. 1g; lanes 5 versus 6, NS;
lanes 2 versus 6, P < 0.005). Notably, the negative control for KSR-binding (analogue
APS-3-77; see Extended Data Fig. 2b, c for comparative selectivity profiling) was inactive,

whereas a positive-control RAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, was active irrespective of the KSRmutational status (Fig. 1g). Therefore, on the basis of similarity in phenotype and also
direct-binding activity, we identify APS-2-79 as a small-molecule mimic of KSR alleles that
suppress oncogenic Ras mutations.

Author Manuscript

KSR-based activity of APS-2-79 as a MAPK antagonist was further evaluated using
reconstitution assays. Dose-dependent phosphorylation of MEK on Ser218/Ser222 by RAF
in vitro could be enhanced at least fivefold in the presence of KSR (Extended Data Fig. 3a–
c). KSR-stimulated MEK phosphorylation by RAF was markedly reduced by the addition of
APS-2-79, but not by APS-3-77 (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). APS-2-79 was inactive when
KSR was absent or when the KSR2(A690F) mutant was used for in vitro assays (Extended
Data Fig. 3d, f, g), suggesting that the activity of APS-2-79 derives from direct targeting of
KSR. Indeed, APS-2-79 lacked direct activity against the highly homologous active RAF
family kinases, including recombinant BRAF and CRAF, or cellular BRAF(V600E)
(Extended Data Figs 2, 3, 4a). Therefore, on the basis of reconstitution and selectivity
assays, we conclude that APS-2-79 functions as an antagonist of MEK phosphorylation by
RAF through direct binding of the KSR active site.
Notably, we found that a previously described ATP-competitive and active-state binder of
KSR termed ASC24 (ref 7), in contrast to APS-2-79, did not antagonize KSR-dependent
MEK phosphorylation by RAF (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e), suggesting that inhibition of
catalytic activity alone in KSR is insufficient to block MAPK signalling. Consistent with
this notion, removal of putative KSR phosphorylation sites7 in MEK neither impeded
MAPK signalling nor blocked the inhibitory activity of APS-2-79 within cells (Extended
Data Fig. 4b).

Author Manuscript

Previous studies established that genetic suppressors in KSR may impede RAF-induced
conformational changes in KSR required for MEK activation or destabilize KSR–MEK and
KSR–RAF complexes6,7,12,17–19. To distinguish between such possible modes of action, we
determined an X-ray crystal structure of the KSR2–MEK1 complex bound to APS-2-79
(Fig. 2a). In the APS-2-79-bound state, KSR2 binds MEK1 in a 1:1 fashion within a
quaternary arrangement that is nearly identical to the ATP-bound state of KSR2–MEK1
complexes7 (Extended Data Fig. 5). Within both states, KSR2 and MEK1 bind via a face-toface arrangement mediated largely through reciprocal helix αG and activation segment
interactions, and KSR2 homodimerizes through the N-lobe along a crystallographic two-fold
symmetry axis producing a hetero-tetramer of KSR2–MEK1 dimers.

Author Manuscript

In the APS-2-79-bound state, only KSR2 was found to possess strong electron density that
could be assigned to APS-2-79 (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Two portions of APS-2-79
engage distinct regions in KSR2. First, the biphenyl ether extends to a sub-pocket within
KSR2, defined by Thr739, Arg692, Asp803 and a hydrophobic shell composed of Phe725,
Tyr714 and Phe804 (Fig. 2b, c). Stacking interactions between the terminal phenyl in
APS-2-79, and Phe725, Tyr714 and Phe804 in particular are expected to provide strong
interactions between KSR2 and APS-2-79 through the arrangement of a four-member
aromatic-pair network (Fig. 2b, c). The existence of this network was substantiated by
removal of the terminal phenyl in APS-2-79-like compounds, which greatly diminished

competition of ATPbiotin probe-labelling in KSR2 (Extended Data Fig. 7; APS-1-68-2 versus
APS-1-70-1 and APS-1-82-1). This network of aromatic-pair interactions, in addition to
other amino acid substitutions, probably contributes to the selectivity of APS-2-79 for KSR
over RAF (Extended Data Fig. 6c, e). Second, a hydrogen bond between the N1 in the
quinazoline core of APS-2-79 and the backbone at Cys742 further mediates APS-2-79–
KSR2 interactions. Notably, functionalization of the N1 with a methyl group (APS-3-6)
greatly diminished KSR2–MEK1 activity, whereas replacement of the N3 with –CH
(APS-2-16) was moderately tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 7). Therefore, on the basis of
crystallographic analysis and also structurE–activity relationships data from our analogue
series, APS-2-79 binds directly to KSR2 within the KSR2–MEK1 complex.

In both the APS-2-79- and ATP-bound states of KSR2–MEK1, KSR2 directly engages the
activation segment of MEK1, burying the Ser218–Ser222 region and presumably shielding
this segment of MEK from promiscuous phosphorylation. The KSR2–MEK1–APS-2-79
structure revealed a portion of KSR2 that was not previously modelled in the ATP-bound
complex (Extended Data Fig. 6d). This region, encompassing residues Ile809 to Gln814,
which we refer to as the induced lock, forms an extension of the activation segment C
terminus to the conserved DFG motif, and forms an anti-parallel β-strand with the peptide
sequence centred around Arg823 in KSR2 (Fig. 2d). Additionally, the ordering of residues
Ile809 to Gln814 in KSR2 occurs at the expense of disorder of residues 674 to 676 in the Ploop, which in the ATP-bound state directly coordinates the β and γ phosphates (Fig. 2e).
The two modes by which ATP and APS-2-79 affect KSR-based interactions on MEK appear
mutually exclusive as both ligands induce conformations that would otherwise clash with
one another (Fig. 2e). We interpret these structures to suggest that APS-2-79 stabilizes an
inactive state of KSR2 characterized by reinforcement of negative regulatory inter actions.
Indeed, APS-2-79 behaves as a KSR-dependent antagonist of RAF-mediated MEK
phosphorylation by shifting the equilibrium of KSR–MEK complexes so as to populate the
OFF state (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

Comparison of the ATP-bound and APS-2-79-bound states of KSR2–MEK1 suggested that
APS-2-79 antagonizes RAF phosphorylation on MEK indirectly by impeding KSR–RAF
heterodimers. As well as APS-2-79 binding, the dimer interface of KSR2, including residues
Trp685 and His686, demonstrated perturbations relative to the ATP-bound conformation
(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 8). To investigate directly the effect of APS-2-79 on KSR2–
BRAF dimerization, we used bio-layer inferometry (BLI) to monitor real-time association
and dissociation of KSR2–MEK1 or free MEK1 to a sensor tethered with immobilized
BRAF. In control experiments, we found that KSR2–MEK1 complexes did not associate
with immobilized BRAF in a 1:1 fashion (Fig. 3b), probably owing to the formation of
higher order BRAF–KSR2–MEK1 complexes. In contrast, BRAF bound to free MEK1 in a
1:1 fashion with a dissociation constant (Kd) = 51 ± 3.8 nM (Fig. 3c), which is in close
agreement to published work20.
To specifically monitor KSR2–BRAF dimerization relative to other possible interactions, we
identified a mutation in BRAF(F667E) that eliminates binding to free MEK but not KSR2–
MEK1 complexes (Fig. 3d, e). KSR2–MEK1 interacted in a 1:1 fashion with the
BRAF(F667E) mutant with a Kd of 1.99 ± 0.09 μM; closely matching previously published

BRAF–BRAF dimerization values6. Notably, the addition of a secondary mutation, known
to perturb KSR2–BRAF dimers (BRAF(F667E/R509H); Fig. 3f), completely abrogated any
binding signal between KSR2–MEK1 and BRAF. In the presence of APS-2-79, the KSR2–
BRAF(F667E) dimers did not associate (Fig. 3g), consistent with the prediction of the
crystal structure suggesting that APS-2-79 may impede RAF–KSR dimers. In contrast, the
control com pound APS-3-77 did not impede KSR2–BRAF interactions (Extended Data Fig.
8c). Therefore, we conclude that BRAF can dimerize with KSR2–MEK1 complexes directly
via KSR2, and this interaction is antagonized by APS-2-79.

Ras mutations occur in approximately 25% of all cancer patients and are highly associated
with poor response to therapy1. Significant progress has been made in targeting
BRAF(V600E)-mutant melanoma, however RAF and MEK inhibitors have failed to achieve
significant clinical efficacy in Ras-mutant disease owing in part to mechanisms of inhibitorinduced transactivation and feedback, respectively21. MEK-inhibitor feedback has been
characterized by upstream Ras activation and induction of higher-order RAF–RAF and also
RAF–KSR complexes22–24. In an engineered cell system, we found that a Ras-suppressor
allele (R718H6,7) within KSR reduced MEK inhibitor-induced feedback (Extended Data
Fig. 4c), suggesting the possibility that KSR heterodimerization may limit the efficacy of
MEK inhibitors. Owing to the more pronounced role of KSR in Ras-mutant, as opposed to
RAF-mutant signalling15,25, and the ability of APS-2-79 to impede KSR–RAF
heterodimerization, we hypothesized that stabilization of the KSR-inactive state (KSRi) via
APS-2-79 may potentiate the effect of MEK inhibitors by limiting feedback in Ras-mutant
models. We therefore tested for synergy of APS-2-79 with MEK inhibitors in Ras-mutant
cell lines, and used RAF-mutant cell lines as controls.

We found that APS-2-79 shifted the cell viability dose response to trametinib in Ras-mutant
cell lines HCT-116 and A549, but not BRAF mutant cell lines SK-MEL-239 and A375 (Fig.
4a). Although the cellular effects of APS-2-79 alone were modest, combination analysis
over full concentration matrices revealed that KSRi synergizes with trametinib, and other
MEK inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 9a), specifically in KRAS mutant cell lines (Fig. 4b).
APS-3-77, and additional control compounds (Extended Data Fig. 9b and 10), did not
demonstrate Ras-mutant-specific synergy, supporting the hypothesis that the enhanced
activity of trametinib when combined with APS-2-79 depends on co-modulation of KSR. To
determine the possible mechanism for APS-2-79 and trametinib synergy, we examined
MAPK signal ling and found that APS-2-79 treatment caused a twofold enhancement in the
IC90 of trametinib on ERK phosphorylation in the Ras-mutant HCT-116 cell line but not the
RAF-mutant SK-MEL-239 cell line (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 4d). The data presented
here provide proof-of-concept for the use of KSRi to overcome a key liability of a clinical
MEK inhibitor in K-Ras mutant cells. Indeed, we posit stabilization of the KSRi as a
mechanism to impede feedback activated Ras–MAPK signalling induced by MEK inhibition
(Fig. 4d).
Here we have identified a unique conformation in KSR through the discovery of APS-2-79.
This compound offers a foundation for the development of a new class of targeted therapies
based on stabilization of the KSR inactive state. Future efforts will be directed towards
improving the pharmacological properties of APS-2-79 to enable in vivo and clinical studies.

In general, the stabilization of conformational states with small-molecule modulators may be
an effective strategy to target other pseudokinases26,27. Furthermore, the results presented
here, using KSRi in combination with clinical MEK inhibitors, suggests a mechanism to
improve the efficacy of inhibitors that target enzymatically active kinases through comodulation of pseudokinase–active kinase signalling complexes.

Codon optimized versions of human KSR2 kinase domain (KSR2(KD)), residues 634-950)
and rabbit MEK1 (1-393) were co-expressed from the pFastbac dual vector (Thermo Fisher)
using the baculovirus/SF21 insect cell system. Note: we refer to KSR2(KD):MEK1 and
KSR2:MEK1 interchangeably throughout the manuscript unless otherwise noted. TEVcleavable His6 tags were added to the N-termini of both KSR2(KD) and MEK1. SF21 cells
expressing the KSR2(KD):MEK1 complex were lysed by freeze-thaw and sonication. Cobalt
resin (Clontech) was used to capture KSR2(KD):MEK1 complexes, and eluted proteins were
subsequently dialyzed in 50 mMTris pH 7.5, 200 mMNaCl, 10mM MnCl2, and 5 mM DTT
to which TEV protease and λ-phosphatase were added. The dialysis buffer was also
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Thermo Fisher). Dialysis retentate
was diluted 3 fold and applied to a 5 mL HiPrep SP HP column (GE Healthcare) from which
excess MEK1, TEV, and the 1:1 KSR2:MEK1 complex were separated using a salt gradient
(50 to 1000 mMNaCl)(Extended Data Fig. 1C). Fractions containing the 1:1
KSR2(KD):MEK1 complex were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and coomassie staining.
Selected fractions were then pooled and applied to a Hiprep Superdex 200 10/300 GL size
exclusion column for final purification in buffer consisting of 25mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM
NaCl, and 10mM DTT. KSR2(KD):MEK1 eluted in two peaks, representing heterodimer
(minor) and heterotetramer (major) species. Excess unphosphorylated MEK1, which was
purified separately over a Hiprep Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column in buffer
25mM Tris pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, and 10mM DTT eluted as a monomer. Expression and
purification of the KSR2(KDA690F):MEK1 (1-393) mutant and the crystallized
KSR2(KD):MEK1(35-393) complexes were purified in the same fashion.

Author Manuscript

B-RAF and B-RAF mutant constructs (B-RAF(V600E), B-RAF(F667E), B-RAF (F667ER509H)) were purified as previously described with slight modification28. In particular, we
utilized a modified variant of B-RAF (I543A, I544S, I551K, Q562R, L588N, K630S,
Y673S, A688R, L706S, Q709R, S713E, L716E, S720E, P722S, K723G) that could be
expressed in high yield from E.Coli and which also retained near wild-type levels of B-RAF
binding activity towards free MEK1. ERK2 was purified as previously described29. C-RAF
was purchased from EMD Millipore (14-352). MEK-active, a pre-phosphorylated form of
MEK, was also purchased from EMD Millipore (14-429).
ATP-biotin competition and reconstituted kinase assays
To identify active site directed ligands of KSR, we conducted competition experiments
against an activity-based probe (ATPbiotin) that specifically labels the ATP-binding pocket of
purified KSR2:MEK1 complexes (Fig. 1B). ATPbiotin transfers a desthio-biotin group via a

reactive acyl-phosphate linkage onto active-site lysines when bound to either KSR2 or
MEK1 (Extended Data Fig. 1D; see ref.30). Competition experiments demonstrated that
labeling occurs within the active sites of both KSR2 and MEK1 with free ATP IC50 values
of 86 μM and 133 μM, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1F). We also confirmed that this
probe leads to a covalent attachment of desthiobiotin on KSR through detection with
Streptavidin-HRP and intact mass spectrometry, the latter of which confirmed the addition of
one or two desthiobiotin groups (equivalent to a mass increase of 196.1 Da per desthiobiotin
group) onto both MEK1 and KSR2, respectively, under non-saturating conditions (Extended
Data Fig. 1E). For intact masses, purified KSR2:MEK1 complexes were analyzed by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on a Waters Xevo TQD system
through deconvolution of molecular ion peaks (MaxEnt; MassLynx).

KSR2 is highly unstable when expressed in isolation, and we therefore conducted all
biochemical assays on purified KSR2:MEK1 complexes. The ATP based competition
experiments suggested the utility of the ATPbiotin competition assay to identify direct binders
of KSR2, MEK1, or both kinases within purified complexes. We screened a collection of
176 structurally diverse commercially available and in-house synthesized kinase inhibitors
for direct competition of ATPbiotin probe labeling (Fig. 1C). ATP-biotin competition screens
(as presented in Figure 1C) were performed by pre-incubating 0.5 μM of KSR2-MEK1 with
20 μM of compounds, 25 mMTris pH 7.5, 150 mMNaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2% DMSO.
ATPbiotin was then added to initiate labeling at a final concentration of 2 μM, and following
5 minutes of incubation, the reactions were quenched by addition of 6X SDS loading dye.
Samples were applied to a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel, separated, and then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
diluted in TBS-T for 30 minutes and subsequently probed with the Pierce™ High Sensitivity
Streptavidin-HRP overnight. For preliminary assays, compounds were screened at least
twice at a concentration of 20μM. Western blot signals were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence and a CCD based detector on a ChemDoc XRS+ imaging system
(Biorad). Image acquisition and analysis, including quantification of band intensities, was
performed using Image Lab™Software (Biorad).

To determine compound IC50 values against KSR2:MEK1, BRAF, BRAF(V600E), CRAF,
MEK, and ERK, 50nM of protein was incubated with 8 doses of inhibitor from 78nM to
5μM in a two-fold dilution series. 2μM of ATPbiotin was added to initiate labeling, and
incubated for 5 minutes before quenching with 6X SDS load dye. Reactions were resolved
by gel electrophoresis and western blotting as described above. Assays were completed in
duplicate and non-linear dose response curves were used to derive IC50 values using Prism
6.0 software (Graphpad). See Extended Data Fig. 2B and 7 for representative images of gels
from which IC50 values were derived.
For the B-RAF and C-RAF phosphorylation assays (Extended Data Figure 3), the indicated
concentrations of B-RAF or 5nM of C-RAF were pre-incubated with 500 nM KSR2:MEK1
or 500 nM MEK1. Compounds diluted in DMSO were added at a final concentration of 1
μM and incubated for an additional 15 minutes in buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150
mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2% DMSO. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition
of 1 mM ATP and halted at the indicated times by the addition of 6X SDS loading dye.

Crystallization of KSR2(KD):MEK1 complexed with APS-2-79

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Prior to crystallization, the KSR2(KD):MEK1(35-393) complex was buffer exchanged via
size exclusion chromatography in 15 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 150 NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 5
mM DTT. The KSR2(KD):MEK1(35-393) complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and
incubated with 500 μM APS-2-79. Aggregates were removed through centrifugation at
14,000 g for 10 minutes. Over a thousand crystallization conditions were tested using inhouse and sparse matrix screens via hanging-drop methods at 4, 10, and 22 °C. Multiple
conditions resulted in small and poorly diffracting crystals. Ultimately, relatively large
hexagonal shaped crystals of approximately 200 microns in size arose from a condition
containing 12% PEG-3350, 100 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.25, 200 mM sodium citrate, and 10 mM
Magnesium Acetate. These crystals were flash-frozen following step-wise soaking in mother
liquor spiked with increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol (25% maximum). A 3.5 Å
data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 23-ID-B (Argonne
National Laboratory). Diffraction images were indexed and scaled using XDS. The structure
of KSR2(KD):MEK1 in complex with APS-2-79 was solved by molecular replacement
using Phaser31 based on searches of KSR2 (chain B) and MEK1 (chain C) models derived
from the KSR2(KD):MEK1:ATP crystal structure (PDB code: 2Y4I). Model building was
performed with Coot32. Rigid body and maximum likelihood based refinement protocols
were implemented through Phenix33. APS-2-79 and induced-lock segments were omitted
from early rounds of refinement. Crystals for the ATP and APS-2-79 bound KSR2:MEK1
complexes share similar unit cell dimensions, space group symmetry, and X-ray diffraction
properties. Detailed data collection and refinement statistics are included in Supplementary
Table 2.

DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin.
All cell signaling assays (as shown in Figure 1E-G, 4, Extended Data Figure 4) were
performed by plating 100K cells per well in a 12-well dish. Cells were plated 24 hours prior
to transfection or inhibitor treatments. Cells were lysed and harvested in RIPA buffer
supplemented with Halt phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 78440). 6X SDS
loading dye was added and samples were heated at 95°C for 5 minutes. Samples were run on
4-15% Tris-HCL gradient gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1hr with 5%
milk TBS-T. Blots were probed overnight with primary antibody in 5%BSA TBS-T.

Cell viability assays were performed in 96 well plates. Optimal cell densities for 96 well
plate assays were determined to obtain linear growth over the time course of assays.
Specifically, A549, HCT-116, A375, SK-MEL-239, COLO-205, LOVO, SK-MEL-2,
CALU-6, MEWO, SW620 and SW1417 cells were plated at 500 cells per well and treated
with inhibitors for 72hrs before measuring viability. H2087 and HEPG2 cells were plated at
2000 cells per well, and treated with inhibitors for 72hrs. Cell viability was measured using
resazurin, and the percent cell viability was determined by normalizing inhibitor-treated
samples to DMSO controls.

values are determined from the single agent dose responses of each compound, and Bliss
scores were calculated by determining the difference between the expected combination
value [Fractional response of Drug 1 (Fa) + Fractional effect of Drug 2 (Fb))-(Fa*Fb)] and
the observed combination value (the viability observed from combination treatment with
Drug1 and Drug2 normalized relative to DMSO controls). To determine if two drugs were
synergistic (ie. in practice, where scores are significantly greater than 0), we analyzed the
combinations (eg. Trametinib and APS-2-79) over a 10 × 5 matrix, and from this analysis
calculated Bliss scores as the sum of differences between observed and predicted growth
inhibition for each combination tested (as displayed in Figure 4 and Extended Data Figure 9;
also Supplementary Table 4). Average Bliss scores and standard deviations were determined
from two biological replicates of full matrices for each cell line and combination.
Combination indexes (CI)35 were separately calculated using the Compusyn Software
developed by Combosyn Inc. In general, CIs less than zero are considered synergistic.

Biolayer Inferometry Using Octet Red 96

Author Manuscript

Interactions between purified B-RAF and the KSR2:MEK1 complex were measured using
biolayer inferometry on the Octet Red96 system (Forte Bio). Binding experiments were
performed at 30°C in buffer containing 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2, 1 % BSA,
and 0.01% Tween. B-RAF and B-RAF mutant proteins were biotinylated using EZ-Link™
Sulfo-NHS-Biotinin buffer containing 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2 and 10%
glycerol according to manufacturer instructions (Thermo Fisher, 21217). Excess biotin was
removed overnight through dialysis and recaptured material was subsequently concentrated
to 3 mg/mL and snap frozen prior to binding assays. For the studies described in Figure 3
and Extended Data Figure 8, 300 nM of biotinylated B-RAF was captured on preimmobilized streptavidin Dip and Read sensor heads (ForteBio, 18-5019) with total B-RAF
loaded up to a refractive index of between 1 and 1.5 nanometers. RAF-immobilized sensor
heads were subsequently incubated in solutions containing increasing concentrations of
purified KSR2:MEK1 or MEK1 (range: 625 nM to 10 μM in two-fold dilutions) and the
association of these complexes was measured over 660 seconds. Dissociation was then
monitored over 840 seconds in buffer solution. To measure the effects of compounds on
KSR2:MEK1 or free MEK1 assembly with BRAF, all compounds were pre-incubated with
KSR2:MEK1 or free MEK1 at a concentration of 25 μM. Data sets were normalized and
analyzed using global fit binding models over all concentrations(Fortebio software) to derive
Kon, Koff and KD values as shown in Figure 3 and Extended Data Figure 8.
Chemical Synthesis

Author Manuscript

General Methods—All solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as
received; anhydrous solvents were used for reactions, and HPLC grade solvents were used
for aqueous work ups, recrystallizations and chromatography. The palladium metal on solid
support, used in hydrogenation reactions, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as 10% w/w
on activated carbon (dry basis), with 50% w/w water added (Degussa type); designated in
procedures as “5% w/w on activated carbon”. Other reagents were purchased from various
vendors and were used as received. Reactions were run as described in the individual
procedures using standard double manifold and syringe techniques. Glassware was dried by
baking in an oven at 130 °C for ≥12h prior to use, or flame-dried. The pH of aqueous

solutions was estimated using pH paper. Vacuum filtrations were carried out using a house
vacuum line (∼100 torr). In the individual procedures, the phrases “concentrated under
vacuum” and “concentrated to dryness” mean that solvent was removed on a rotary
evaporator using a diaphragm pump (with an automatic vacuum regulator) and then
remaining traces of volatiles were removed on a high-vacuum (<1 torr) oil pump. Unless
specified otherwise, the term “flask” refers to the round-bottomed variety.

Reactions were monitored by TLC using EMD silica gel 60 F254 (250 μm) glass-backed
plates (visualized by UV fluorescence quenching and stained with basic KMnO4 solution)
and by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Analysis by reversephase LC-MS was carried out on a Waters Aquity I-Class UPLC system, with a C18 column
(2.1 × 30 mm, 1.7 μm particle size), heated at 50 °C, eluting at 0.6 mL/min, using a 3 min
linear gradient method with a mobile phase consisting of water/acetonitrile (0.1% v/v formic
acid added to each): 95:5→1:99(0-2.5 min), 1:99(2.5-3 min). Sample runs were monitored
using alternating positive/negative electrospray ionization (50-1000 amu) and UV detection
at 254 nm. Dimensions of “plugs”, “pads” and “columns” for filtration or flash
chromatography are reported as: ((diameter × length) cm). The 5¾ inch pipets (4 mL) used
for filtration and micro scale flash chromatography were purchased from Fisher Scientific
(product number 22-378-893). Automated preparative normal- and reverse-phase
chromatography was carried out on an Interchim PuriFlash 450 purification system with a
diode array detector (runs were monitored at 220-400 nm) Pre-packed silica gel cartridges
(12, 25 and 40 g) were employed for normal-phase chromatography, eluting at 20-30 mL/
min. For reverse-phase chromatography a C18 column (30 × 150 mm, 5 μm particle size)
was used, eluting at 15-20 mL/min with a pressure limit of 50 bar. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded at 400 MHz on a Bruker spectrometer and are reported in ppm using the residual
solvent signal (dimethylsulfoxide-d6 = 2.50 ppm) as an internal standard. Data are reported
as: {(δ shift), [(s=singlet, d=doublet, dd=doublet of doublets, br=broad, m=multiplet),
(J=coupling constant in Hz) and (integration}. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were
recorded at 100 MHz on a Bruker spectrometer and are reported in ppm using the residual
solvent signal (dimethylsulfoxide-d6 = 39.5 ppm) as an internal standard.

Author Manuscript

a, APS-2-79 does not affect BRAF(V600E)-induced MAPK activation in cells.
BRAF(V600E)–Flag was expressed for 24 h in 293H cells. Cells were then treated for 2 h
with DMSO or 5μM of either APS-2-79, APS-3-77, or dabrafenib before collection and
western blot analysis of phosphorylated MEK (MEK1/2(pSer218/pSer222)) and ERK
(ERK1/2(pT202/pY204)). b, Removal of putative KSR phosphorylation sites in MEK
(MEK(AAAA); S18A, T23A, S24A, S72A; ref. 7) neither hinders KSR-dependent MAPK

of the ATP- and APS-2-79-bound KSR2–MEK1 complexes are listed below. c, A model for
APS-2-79 function as a KSR-targeted antagonist of MAPK signalling. APS-2-79 shifts the
equilibrium of KSR2–MEK1 complexes so to populate the OFF state (left), and thereby
antagonizes RAF dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of KSR-bound MEK (far
right). The model for RAF dimerization and MEK phosphorylation are adapted from ref. 7.
In this model, the role of RAFcat may be fulfilled by multiple active RAF-family kinases,
such as C-RAF, bound within homo- or heterodimers of RAF–RAF or KSR–RAF,
respectively.

KSR2, which adopt distinct orientations from the equivalent Phe residues in RAF kinases,
directly contact the biphenyl ether motif in APS-2-79. The T802G substitution, as well as
the positional differences of the above-mentioned aromatic residues, would be predicted to
reduce binding of active RAFs with APS-2-79. Another interaction that is probably favoured
in KSR includes the contact mediated by the epsilon nitrogen of Arg692 with the –O- linker
of the biphenyl motif; the placement of Arg692 is stabilized by Asp803 of the DFG motif. In
RAF, the Arg-to-Lys substitution (Lys483 in subdomain II of BRAF), lacks the equivalent
nitrogens to bond with both the –O- linker in APS-2-79 and the aspartate of the DFG motif.

Extended Data Figure 10. APS-2-79 synergizes with trametinib specifically in Ras-mutant cells
compared to the HER-family and SRC-family inhibitors lapatinib and sarcatinib

Author Manuscript

a, Chemical structures of APS-2-79 and quinazoline-containing kinase inhibitors sarcatinib
and lapatinib. The primary targets for sarcatinib and lapatinib are c-Src and Her2,
respectively30. IC50 values against ATPbiotin probe-labelling of KSR2 are listed below
structures. b, Bliss score analysis of HCT-116, A549, A375 and SK-MEL-239 cells treated
with APS-2-79, sarcatinib, or lapatinib (range: 100–3,000 in threefold dilutions) in
combination with trametinib (range: 0.01–100 in threefold dilution). Bars represent the mean
Bliss scores calculated from two biological replicates; points represent each calculated
score. c, Absolute Bliss score of the indicated drugs in combination with trametinib in Rasmutant relative to RAF-mutant cell lines demonstrates selective synergy in Ras-mutant cell
lines for APS-2-79 compared to sarcatinib and lapatinib. d, log of the combination index
graphs of APS-2-79 in combination with trametinib in HCT-116 versus SK-MEL-239 cells
as compared to the fractional effect. Negative combination index over a broad fractional
effect range within HCT-116, but not SK-MEL-239, indicates strong synergy.
