ABSTRACT
As an environmental poison, arsenic is responsible for many cancer deaths.
Paradoxically, arsenic trioxide (ATO) presents also a powerful therapy used to treat
refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is intensively investigated for
treatment of other cancer types. Noteworthy, cancer therapy is frequently hampered
by drug resistance, which is also often associated with enhancement of tumor
aggressiveness.
In this study, we analyzed ATO-selected cancer cells (A2780ATO) for the
mechanisms underlying their enhanced tumorigenicity and aggressiveness. These
cells were characterized by enhanced proliferation and spheroid growth as well
as increased tumorigenicity of xenografts in SCID mice. Noteworthy, subsequent
studies revealed that overexpression of Met receptor was the underlying oncogenic
driver of these effects, as A2780ATO cells were characterized by collateral sensitivity
against Met inhibitors. This finding was also confirmed by array comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) and whole genome gene expression arrays, which revealed
that Met overexpression by chronic ATO exposure was based on the transcriptional
regulation via activation of AP-1. Finally, it was shown that treatment with the
Met inhibitor crizotinib was also effective against A2780ATO cell xenografts in vivo,
indicating that targeting of Met presents a promising strategy for the treatment of
Met-overexpressing tumors after either arsenic exposure or failure to ATO treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Arsenic is known for its therapeutic potential and
has been used for more than two millennia in the treatment
of various diseases including cancer [1]. In the late 1970s,
ATO was rediscovered as a potent anticancer agent against
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and finally approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and

to ATO are the induction of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), decrease of the mitochondrial membrane
potential, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins or
activation of proto-oncogenes [4, 5]. Auspicious results
from preclinical studies motivated several clinical
trials in solid tumors, unfortunately without significant
efficacy [6–8]. Nevertheless, ATO as a single treatment
or in combination with other drugs is currently under
investigation in a variety of solid cancers including lung,
bladder, liver, colon, brain, breast, cervix, esophagus,
and skin cancer (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Like for many
other anticancer drugs, limitations of ATO are based on
intrinsic and acquired drug resistance [2]. Noteworthy,
development of drug resistance is frequently associated
with the appearance of a more aggressive cancer
phenotype [9, 10]. Consequently, it is of interest to
investigate the underlying mechanisms of therapy failure
and to use this knowledge for further treatment strategies.
Arsenic is not only in the focus of interest due
to its anticancer activity but, besides, it is a primary
concern as environmental poison with 200 million
people estimated to be at risk of toxic exposure
worldwide [11]. Especially Bangladesh, India, Vietnam,
Thailand, Mexico, but also the United States are among
the countries that reported poisoning from elevated
levels of arsenic in groundwater and soil [11, 12].
First signs of chronic arsenic poisoning (arsenicosis)
are cutaneous manifestations including melanosis,
keratosis, and skin cancers [13]. Furthermore, longterm exposure to arsenic was shown to cause cancers
of the bladder, lung, and liver [14]. However, although
some mechanisms underlying this carcinogenicity have
already been described, the exact mode of action is
still a matter of discussion. Arsenic and its metabolites
have been shown to generate ROS as a potential
inducer of genomic instability through DNA damage,
impaired DNA repair or telomere dysfunction [15].
Mutations originating from this DNA damage might
silence tumor suppressors like pro-apoptotic genes or
activate proto-oncogenes which in turn lead to genomic
instability and cellular transformation [15]. As an
example, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
has been described as one of the potential oncogenes
to be activated directly or via SRC proto-oncogene in
keratinocytes and human lung cells after chronic arsenic
exposure [16–18].
Recently, we revealed that solid cancer cells manage
to escape from ATO treatment by stimulation of DNA
damage repair via the EGFR signaling pathway [19]. In
order to investigate the potential anticancer activity of
arsenic in solid tumors, cell-transforming capabilities of
ATO have to be considered as well. Thus, in this study, we
aimed to investigate the impact of acquired ATO resistance
on the aggressiveness of an ATO-sensitive ovarian cancer
cell model and elucidate the underlying molecular
mechanisms.

Activity of ATO against various solid cancer cell
lines and selection for acquired resistance
A panel of different well-established human cell
models from various solid tumors was used in this study.
Overall, ATO exhibited an anticancer activity in the lower
µM range (Supplementary Figure S1A). Accordingly,
environmentally and clinically relevant concentrations
of arsenic range from 100 pmol/L – 2 μmol/L [3, 20]. In
our test panel, the ovarian cancer cell model A2780 was
the most sensitive with an IC50 of 1.2 µmol/L. Thus, this
cell line was selected to generate an ATO-resistant subline
and to analyze the response mechanisms to chronic ATO
exposure.
The A2780ATO subline selected for acquired ATO
resistance showed an elongated mesenchymal-like cell
shape in cell culture fostered by chronic ATO exposure
compared to epitheloid parental A2780 cells (Figure
1A upper panel). In terms of ATO responsiveness, the
A2780ATO subline in comparison to parental A2780 cells
was distinctly less responsive to 20 µmol/L ATO after
24 h (Figure 1A lower panel), showed a 4-fold resistance
after three days in viability testing (Figure 1B), and up to
28-fold resistance after seven days of ATO treatment in
clonogenicity assays (Figure 1C).

Proliferation and tumor aggressiveness
of ATO-resistant cells
Noteworthy, the proliferation rate between A2780ATO
and A2780 was similar during the first 48 h after seeding.
However, after 72 h, ATO-resistant cells proliferated
significantly faster than the parental cells (up to 1.8-fold
on day 4) (Figure 2A). Furthermore, soft agar assays
showed enhanced three-dimensional growth of A2780ATO
cells indicated by both higher number as well as increased
size of spheroid clones (Figure 2B). Faster proliferation
and favorable spheroid growth were previously described
as attributes of cancer cell aggressiveness and stemness
[21, 22]. Consequently, to investigate the in vivo
aggressiveness and tumorigenicity, both resistant and
sensitive A2780 cells were analyzed as xenografts in
SCID mice. Here, the tumorigenicity of A2780ATO was
distinctly higher with 100% tumor take after 31 days of
xenotransplantation in comparison to 62% in the A2780
group. Moreover, A2780ATO xenograft tumors appeared
earlier (Figure 2C). Enhanced aggressiveness was also
reflected by decreased survival of A2780ATO tumor-bearing
mice. Half-mean survival (50% of the investigated mice
still alive) after xenotransplantation with A2780 was 35
days, whereas that of mice transplanted with A2780ATO
was distinctly shorter with only 25 days (Figure 2D).
Altogether, these data indicate that ATO-resistant cells

are more proliferative and aggressive as compared to the
parental cells.

after 3 h of drug treatment (Supplementary Figure
S1B). These experiments confirmed that the resistance
of A2780ATO cells is not based on enhanced drug efflux.
A2780ATO cells were further tested for cross-resistance
against several anticancer drugs with specific modes
of action and targets. The panel of tested compounds
included conventional chemotherapeutic drugs like
doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and vincristine but also
diverse kinase inhibitors targeting 1) EGFR and HER2
(lapatinib), 2) VEGFR, PDGFR, and Raf (sorafenib), 3)
Met (crizotinib and PHA-665752), 4) FAK (FAK inh.)

Met receptor as a proliferative and survival
factor in ATO-resistant cells
As a next step, we investigated the mechanisms
underlying the aggressive phenotype of A2780ATO cells.
First, as decreased drug influx or increased drug efflux
are often observed in the course of chronic drug exposure,
intracellular arsenic levels were measured by ICP-MS

or 5) SRC (SRC inh. II). Resistance factors (RF) of the
respective drugs were calculated from the IC50 after
72 h (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S1). A2780ATO
showed cross-resistance against vincristine, doxorubicin,
the SRC inhibitor, and lapatinib with RFs of 3.7, 3.0,
2.1, and 1.7, respectively. There was no difference
in the anticancer activity (RF~1) against the FAK
inhibitor, paclitaxel, sorafenib and cisplatin. Surprisingly,
A2780ATO cells showed collateral sensitivity towards both
crizotinib and PHA-665752 with RFs of 0.15 and 0.08,
respectively (Figure 3A–3B, Supplementary Table S1
and Supplementary Figure S2A). As crizotinib is already
in clinical use and exerts general superior activity as
compared to PHA-665752, the majority of the subsequent

experiments was performed with this Met inhibitor. In
line with the collateral sensitivity, Met expression was
increased in A2780ATO at both mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 3C). In contrast, the two other well known targets
of crizotinib, namely ALK and ROS1 [23], were not
expressed as indicated by very low mRNA signals detected
(raw expression values for ALK and ROS1 below 10; MET
expression was 88-fold increased in A2780ATO as compared
to A2780) (Supplementary Figure S2B). The role of MET
in the collateral sensitivity towards crizotinib and PHA665752 was confirmed by siRNA transfection experiments,
where specific knockdown of MET significantly inhibited
the viability of A2780ATO, whereas A2780 cells were
not affected (Figure 3D–3E). In accordance, analysis of

ATO alters Met expression in ATO-sensitive and
-resistant cells

immunohistochemistry staining of A2780ATO xenografts
revealed that Met was overexpressed also in the tumor
tissues and showed a spatial positive co-expression with
overexpression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure
3F and Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, A2780
xenografts were Met-negative, which indicates that
proliferation of the parental line is driven by other factors
than Met. Noteworthy, the highly ATO-sensitive parental
line expressed by far the lowest intrinsic Met levels of
all cell models investigated in our initial screening panel
(Supplementary Figure S4; compare Supplementary Figure
S1A). In addition, intrinsic Met expression showed a trend
to inversely correlate with ATO sensitivity in the entire
cell line panel (r2 = 0.3, p = 0.1). This relation became
highly significant when removing two extremely ATOresistant lung cancer cell lines from the regression analysis
(r2 = 0.82, p < 0.002) suggesting that NSCLC cell lines
might be characterized by additional, tissue type-specific
resistance mechanisms against ATO. Summarized, these
observations strongly suggest that Met receptor contributes
to ATO resistance but also enhanced aggressiveness of
ATO-selected A2780 cells.

To
investigate
factors
underlying
Met
overexpression in A2780ATO cells, we analyzed the MET
gene regulation at different levels. Array comparative
genomic hybridization (array CGH) analyses revealed no
change in gene copy number of A2780ATO as compared
to A2780 through the entire genome (Supplementary
Figure S6). This finding indicates that Met expression is
not altered based on a copy number gain of the MET gene
at chromosome 7. Next, MET promoter methylation was
analyzed by pyrosequencing. These experiments revealed
that also no CpG methylation changes within the MET
gene promoter were induced upon chronic ATO exposure
(Figure 5A).
Thus, we hypothesized that ATO treatment might
enhance Met transcription by activation of stress signals.
Consequently, we focused on transcription factors (TFs)
which might regulate MET gene transcription. Putative
TFs binding to the MET promoter were predicted using
the SaBiosciences database (http://www.sabiosciences.
com/chipqpcrsearch.php?app=TFBS) that is based
on DECipherment Of DNA Elements (DECODE).
Supplementary Table S5 shows the fold change in
expression of the most relevant TFs predicted to bind to
the MET promoter in A2780ATO compared to parental cells.
Noteworthy, all mRNA values of the c-Jun family (JUN,
JUNB, and JUND) as well as c-Fos family (FOSB, FOSL1,
and FOS) were among the top upregulated MET promoterbinding TF-coding genes in A2780ATO, suggesting an
important function of AP-1 in Met overexpression (Figure
5B). Among all AP-1 subunit genes, JUN showed the
highest difference with 16.1-fold increased mRNA levels
and c-Jun overexpression in Met-driven A2780ATO (Figure
5C). FOS, FOSB, and FOSL1 genes that code for dimeric
partners of c-Jun for AP-1 showed 3.2-, 5.0-, and 4.8-fold
enhanced mRNA expression in A2780ATO, respectively.
To investigate whether induction of MET and AP-1
family genes by ATO is also observed in other hands, we
used the mRNA expression array data in the hepatocellular
carcinoma cell model HepG2 treated with different
concentrations of ATO for 48 h (published by HaraYamamura et al. in 2013 at Gene Expression Omnibus
database; Accession Nr: GSE48441 [24]) and analyzed
them for the respective gene expression. In line with our
data on A2780 cells, also in these samples induction of
MET expression and a concentration-dependent increase
of all AP-1 family genes (except JUND and FOSL2)
were found (Supplementary Figure S7A). Furthermore,
we also investigated the impact of ATO on pronounced
proliferation of immortalized keratinocytes (NHEKSVTERT), and preliminary results indicate that lowlevel ATO treatment results in increased JUN and MET
expression (Supplementary Figure S7B).

Gene expression profile of A2780ATO is associated
with enhanced cell proliferation and activation
of biosynthesis programs
Whole genome gene expression arrays revealed
that the majority of significantly differently expressed
genes (631 from 806 – see data analysis in materials
and methods) in the ATO-resistant subline compared
to parental A2780 cells play a role in cancer (see IPA
report in Supplementary Materials, Supplementary
Figure S5, and Supplementary Table S2). The top 5
molecular and cellular functions influenced by the genes
significantly changed in A2780ATO as compared to A2780
cells were “cell death and survival”, “cellular growth”,
and “proliferation” as well as “cell morphology”. MET
appeared as one of the top upregulated genes in A2780ATO
and was predicted as the main promoting factor in various
gene networks associated with proliferation of malignant
cells, solid tissue and hematopoietic cells (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Table S3). GSEA analysis of Met pathway
genes showed an upregulation of the respective gene set
in A2780ATO as compared to A2780, with expression of
MET, JUN, FOS, and different Met pathway transducers
like RAP1A, PXN, PAK1, MAP2K2, MAPK2 contributing
the most to the enrichment score (Figure 4B). Regarding
cell proliferation, gene sets of mitotic cell cycle regulation
as well as various metabolic and biosynthetic processes
of various cellular macromolecules like proteins, lipids,
and carbohydrates were positively enriched in A2780ATO
as compared to A2780 and indicate an increased
proliferative program of A2780ATO (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Table S4).

Thus, to investigate the impact of ATO on AP-1
expression in chemo-naive cells, parental A2780 were
treated with ATO at several time points (Figure 5D). The
highest stimulation of c-Jun expression was observed after
24 h of treatment and decreased again with prolonged
incubation. Noteworthy, under direct exposure to ATO no

detectable expression of Met was found over the time of
48 h. However, a rapid but transient stimulation of Met
(as well as c-Jun) expression was found during recovery
from ATO treatment (Figure 5E). These data indicate that
Met activation might play a role in the recovery of A2780
cells surviving ATO treatment, which subsequently turns

and significantly inhibited tumor growth of A2780ATO
xenografts (Figure 6C), while the growth of parental
A2780 tumors was not influenced by Met inhibition.

DISCUSSION

potential if combined with other carcinogens like UV
light, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, diepoxybutane, X-rays,
methylmethane sulfonate, and tobacco [5, 11, 27]. This cocarcinogenicity of arsenic is mainly based on modulation
of cellular stress responses and oxidative DNA damage
[28]. In addition, the activity of arsenic is often related to
direct or indirect interaction with sulfhydryl (SH) moieties
of more than 200 known human proteins [11]. Thus,
activation via direct interaction of arsenic with vicinal
SH groups was proposed for c-SRC and other SH-rich
proteins like EGFR, integrins or protein phosphatases [29].
Furthermore, direct or indirect proto-oncogene activation
by arsenic exposure like KRAS in lung- and prostate
epithelial cells [25, 30], c-Myc in hepatocytes [31–33]
or EGFR in the lung, skin, prostate, bladder and liver
tissue [16, 19, 29, 34] was described. In this study, we
identified activation of oncogenic Met receptor as a new

Arsenicals represent the classical example of a
double-edged sword concerning carcinogenicity and
anti-cancer therapy. As one among the first active
biological compounds identified, the history of arsenicals
comprises many stories of curse and blessing [1, 14].
The carcinogenic potential of arsenic is well known due
to exposure of millions of people to toxic levels from
drinking water and food [11, 12]. Arsenicosis, as the most
common phenotype of exposed people, is also the best
example of arsenic-induced cell transformation. Many
studies have addressed this issue and suggested different
molecular mechanisms [25, 26]. Interestingly, although
tumorigenic capability of chronic arsenic exposure as a
single agent was not conclusively confirmed in animal
models, there is strong evidence for the co-carcinogenic

mechanism of arsenic-induced cancer aggressiveness, thus
adding this protein to the list of oncogenes activated by
arsenic selection. This is in line with previous observations
[35], since all the oncogenic attributes found in our
ATO-resistant cell line like increased cell proliferation,
survival, increased tumorigenicity or a more mesenchymal
phenotype are known to be activated by Met receptor
signaling. Hence, Met overexpression affects many
patients with various cancer types like lung, liver, breast,
prostate, gastric, renal or ovarian cancers, and irrespective
of treatment often correlates with poor prognosis [36,
37]. Especially in ovarian cancer, Met overexpression
was identified as a prognostic marker that correlates with
unfavorable prognosis associated with tumor progression
[38, 39]. Various in vitro and in vivo tumor models
suggest three main mechanisms of underlying constitutive
and prolonged Met activation: 1) ligand-dependent
mechanisms (based on ligand overexpression); 2) specific
genetic lesions (gene translocations, amplifications and
activating mutations); or 3) transcriptional upregulation
of the Met protein [40, 41]. In our ATO-selected A2780
cell model, transcriptional upregulation is likely the
mechanism of Met overexpression induced by ATO as
MET gene amplification and promoter methylation could
be excluded. In contrast, parental chemo-naive A2780
cells showed no expression of Met receptor. Thus, liganddependent activation was not considered to be involved.
However, selective overexpression of several transcription
factors known to bind and activate the MET gene promoter
was found, pointing towards transcriptional activation.
Accordingly, not only Met protein but also mRNA levels
were increased in A2780ATO cells. In line with these
assumptions, members of the AP-1 family were among
the top upregulated transcription factors in A2780ATO
cells. This finding is in accordance with previous studies
that reveal strong evidence of AP-1 in Met transcriptional
regulation [42, 43]. Within the AP-1 family, we identified
c-Jun overexpression as representative part of stable AP-1
complex [44].
Generally, AP-1 is responsible for regulation of
many important genes that control cell proliferation,
survival, and neoplastic transformation [44]. Stimuli that
activate AP-1 activity are of different nature like growth
factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines or a variety of
environmental stresses like short wavelength UV radiation
and specific chemicals [44]. Consequently, there is plenty
of evidence proving the stimulatory effect of arsenic on
AP-1 activation, stability, and DNA binding [45–49].
Thus, arsenic has been shown to stimulate expression of
both c-Jun and c-Fos by several molecular mechanisms.
Interaction of arsenic with vicinal thiols of phosphatases
allows activation of JNK signaling and finally induction
of c-Jun and c-Fos [50, 51]. Additionally, arsenic induced
histone H3 phosphoacetylation and H3K9 hypoacetylation
specifically at the c-Fos and c-Jun chromatin sites as an

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

instant mechanism of AP-1 activation [52, 53]. Moreover,
arsenic was reported to induce malignant transformation
in rat liver epithelial cells by increasing mRNA levels
of MET, HGF, JUN, MYC, and HRAS next to ROS
detoxifying genes (AFP, HMOX1, SOD1, GSTP1, MT1A)
[32]. Thus, our findings on ATO-induced Met via AP-1
upregulation in the ovarian cancer model are well in
agreement with previous studies.
In conclusion, we found that chronic ATO exposure
of our investigated ovarian cancer cells induced stable
Met receptor overexpression as oncogenic driver of
tumorigenicity and aggressiveness. Thus, oncogenic Met
activation by ATO exposure is an important factor that
should be further investigated both in patients with ATOresistant tumors in novel treatment regiments involving
arsenic and also in patients who suffer from cancers
associated with arsenic poisoning. Finally, our findings are
interesting considering that Met inhibition might represent
a valuable tool for treatment of Met-driven tumors induced
by environmental arsenic exposure. Additionally, it needs
to be further elucidated whether failure of arsenic-based
therapy might be related to hyperactivation of Met-derived
oncogenic signals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Crizotinib, sorafenib, and lapatinib were purchased
from LC Laboratories (MA, USA). ATO as well as all
other drugs and reagents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich
(MO, USA). ATO was dissolved in 1 mol/L NaOH at 50
mmol/L concentrated stocks. Cisplatin was dissolved in
dimethylformamide (DMF) at 5 mmol/L, whereas for all
other substances, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stocks at 10
– 100 mmol/L were prepared. Stock solutions were further
diluted into culture media at the indicated concentrations
immediately before use. The final concentrations of initial
drug solvents (NaOH, DMF, and DMSO) were always less
than 1%.

Cell culture
Different human cancer cell lines were used in this
study: Ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA); cervix carcinoma KB3-1 (donated by Dr. Shen, Laboratory of Cell Biology,
National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA); colorectal
carcinoma cell line HCT116 (donated by Dr. B. Vogelstein,
John Hopkins University, MD, USA); melanoma cell line
VM-1 was established at the Institute of Cancer Research
in Vienna [54], and all the other cancer cell models were
supplied by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
HCT116 and U2OS cells were grown in McCoy's and
SW1573 in DMEM culture medium. All other cell lines

were cultivated in RPMI-1640. Culture media were
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Pasching,
Austria). Cell cultures were periodically checked for
contamination. Cell line authentication was performed by
array CGH and/or short tandem repeat fingerprint.

Three dimensional clonogenicity was examined
using two layered agar in 12-well plates. The bottom
layer consisted of 0.6% agar mixed with 1xRPMI, 20%
FCS. Cell suspensions (1000 and 5000) in 20% FCSRPMI with 0.3% agar were prepared as the top layer.
The number of visible spheroid colonies was assessed
microscopically three weeks later by counting the
number of colonies and measuring the surface according
to the formula: A=a×b×π; a=length/2 and b=width/2.
Images of the whole wells were captured with a Nikon
D40 camera or 4x and 10x spheroid micrographs using
Nikon TI300 inverted microscope.

Chronic ATO exposure for resistance
development
A2780ATO cells were generated by periodical
treatment with gradually increasing concentrations of
ATO starting with 0.5 µmol/L for more than two years.
ATO was administered to the cells at the day after they
were passaged and cells had attached to the culture flasks.
The treatment dose was increased when proliferation of
cells was undisturbed upon ATO treatment for more than
2 passages.

Promoter DNA methylation analysis by bisulfite
pyrosequencing
Promoter methylation and pyrosequencing analysis
was performed as previously published [55]. MET
[NG_008996.1] promoter region was identified with the
Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED).
The sequences of the biotin[Btn]-labelled forward
primer, the reverse primer and the sequencing primer
were
5’-[Btn]GGTTGAGTTATTGGTAGGGTA-3´,
5’-CCTCCTCTCAACAAATCAACTAT-3’
and
5’-ACTCCCCATCTACTCACAAAA-3’, respectively.

In vitro cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays
Cell proliferation and drug activity on cell
viability were observed under the inverted microscope
(Nikon Eclipse Ti, Life-Cell Imaging from Visitron
Systems, Germany) and measured with different
colorimetric methods. For MTT assays, 2 – 4 x 103
cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed
to recover for 24 h. Cells were exposed to the test
drugs at the indicated concentrations for 72 h. On
the last day of treatment, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based
vitality assays (EZ4U; Biomedica, Vienna, Austria)
were performed following the manufacturer`s
recommendations. For long-term treatments, cells were
seeded in 24-well plates at 1.2 x 103 cells/well and after
24 h recovery, they were treated for one week with the
indicated drug concentrations. After drug incubation,
cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at 4°C and
stained with crystal violet (1 µg/µl in phosphatebuffered saline). Quantification of cell viability was
done after analyzing micrographs of the stained cells
with Image J, and absorbance measurement (520 nm
with TECAN absorbance reader) of dissolved crystal
violet dye (dissolved in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate).
Cell viability and IC50 values were calculated using
GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, USA).

Whole genome gene expression and data analysis
Gene expression arrays were performed using
4x44K whole genome oligonucleotide-based gene
expression arrays (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) as
previously published [55]. For gene expression analysis,
intensity values were filtered according to sufficient (>20
raw expression values in one of the analyzed groups)
and significant differences in expression (Analyzed
with t-test unpaired - Benjamini-Hochberg correction,
p-value cut-off:0.05). After filtering, 806 genes with
significantly differing levels of expression in A2780ATO
compared to A2780 were further investigated with
QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, CA,
USA). Expression data for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) [56] were normalized in R using Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) normalization approach. Gene sets
of Met pathway and biological processes analyzed were
taken from GSEA MSigDB collection database (Broad
Institute, MA, USA).

Apoptosis assay
Cell death was assessed using annexin V-FITC
(BD Biosciences # 556420) and propidium iodide (PI)
(50 µg/ml Stock). Cell samples were double stained
with 2 µl of each Annexin V-FITC/PI fluorophores
and quantitatively measured using LSRFortessa flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) and further
analyzed using Flowing Software (University of Turku,
Finland).

RNA isolation and Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, MA, USA). mRNA was reverse transcribed
into cDNA and RT-PCR for relative quantification of
target gene expression was performed using SYBR
Green qPCR Master-Mixes (Thermo Scientific, MA,
USA) on a 7500 Fast Real-time instrument (Applied
27389

Oncotarget

Biosystems, MA, USA) following the respective
instructions. Following primers were used: MET
sense: 5′-TCCTGCAGTCAATGCCTCTC-3′ and MET
antisense: 5′-CACATATGGTCAGCCTTGTC-3′; JUN
sense: 5′-GGAAACGACCTTCTATGACG-3′ and JUN
antisense: 5′-CTGCTCATCTGTCACGTTCTT-3′; ACTB
sense: 5′-GGATGCAGAAGGAGATCACTG-3′ and
ACTB antisense: 5′-CGATCCACACGGAGTACTTG-3′.
β-actin gene ACTB served as reference gene.

a week for 2 weeks. Crizotinib was well tolerated without
any change in body weight (Supplementary Figure S8B).

Immunohistochemistry staining
Three μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by blocking the
endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase.
After Heat Induced Antigen Retrieval (HIER) for 10
minutes in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0), the tissue
sections were incubated with primary rabbit mAb Met
(D1C2), Cell Signaling, MA, USA, dilution 1:300,
incubation time 1 h) and Ki67 mouse mAb (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark, dilution 1:100, incubation time 30
min) followed by treatment with Ultravision Labeled
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) polymer (UVLP, Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark, incubation time 15 min). Antibody
binding was visualized with DAB+ chromogen and
counterstained with Heamatoxylin.

Gene knock-down by siRNA
Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, MA, USA) using siRNA against MET
(Dharmacon # L-003156-00-0005) or non-targeting
siRNA (Dharmacon # D-001810-10-05) following the
manufacturer's recommendations. Efficacy and specificity
of gene silencing was verified at the protein level by
Western Blot following 72 h siRNA transfection and
quantified using Image Lab software v. 5.2 (Bio-Rad
laboratories, CA, USA).

Statistics

Total protein lysates or membrane-enriched protein
extracts were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
for Western blotting as described previously [54]. Primary
antibodies used are given in Supplementary Table S6.
Secondary, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used in working
dilutions of 1:10 000.

If not mentioned otherwise, data are expressed as
mean ± SEM. Results were analyzed and illustrated with
GraphPad Prism. Statistical analyses were performed
using t-test, and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with treatment, time, concentration, or cell type as
independent variables. Bonferroni post-tests were
conducted to examine differences between drug treatment
regimens and diverse responses. P values below 0.05 were
considered as statistically significant and marked with
stars: * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001.

Xenograft experiments

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

6- to 8-week-old female CB-17 scid/scid mice
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (IN, USA).
The animals were kept in a pathogen-free environment
and every procedure was done in a laminar airflow
cabinet. The experiments were carried out according to
the regulations of the Ethics Committee for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals at the Medical University
Vienna (Vienna, Austria). For tumorigenicity, 1 × 106
cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank.
Animals were controlled for distress development
every day and tumor size was assessed regularly by
caliper measurement. A positive tumor growth was
counted if tumors were palpable and further reached
volumes > 50 mm3 calculated by the formula: (length
× width2)/2.
For therapeutic activity, tumor-bearing mice were
randomly assigned to treatment groups and therapy was
initiated only when tumors were measurable and started
growing. Animals were treated orally either with 50 mg/kg
crizotinib (dissolved in 5% DMSO, 10% Cremophor EL,
10% ethanol and 75% deionized water) or vehicle, 5-times
