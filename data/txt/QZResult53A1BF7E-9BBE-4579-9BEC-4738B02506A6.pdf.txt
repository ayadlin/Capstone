Abstract
Zanolimumab is a human IgG1 antibody against CD4, which is
in clinical development for the treatment of cutaneous and
nodal T-cell lymphomas. Here, we report on its mechanisms of
action. Zanolimumab was found to inhibit CD4+ T cells by
combining signaling inhibition with the induction of Fcdependent effector mechanisms. First, T-cell receptor (TCR)
signal transduction is inhibited by zanolimumab through a
fast, dual mechanism, which is activated within minutes.
Ligation of CD4 by zanolimumab effectively inhibits early TCR
signaling events but, interestingly, activates signaling through
the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p56lck. An uncoupling of
p56lck from the TCR by anti-CD4 allows the kinase to transmit
direct inhibitory signals via the inhibitory adaptor molecules
Dok-1 and SHIP-1. Second, CD4+ T cells are killed by induction
of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, to which
CD45RO+ cells are more sensitive than CD45RA+ cells. Finally,
zanolimumab induces down-modulation of CD4 from cell
surfaces via a slow Fc-dependent mechanism. In conclusion,
zanolimumab rapidly inhibits T-cell signaling via a dual
mechanism of action combined with potent Fc-dependent lysis
of CD4+ T cells and may act long-term by down-regulating
CD4. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9945–53]

Introduction
The therapeutic activity of CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in
reversal of graft rejection (1), inhibition of various autoimmune
disease animal models (2, 3), and human inflammatory diseases,
such as rheumatoid arthritis (4, 5), as well as the induction of
tolerance (6) and inhibition of HIV-1 infection (7), has been studied
extensively over the past 15 years. Despite initial promise, CD4
mAb has only met limited success in the clinical setting, in part
because immunogenicity, observed in clinical studies using mouse
and chimeric mAb, prevents repeat dosing (8, 9).
Recent clinical progress has, however, been made with
zanolimumab, a human antibody against CD4 isolated from

human antibody transgenic mice (10, 11). Zanolimumab was
assessed in clinical trials in inflammatory diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, in which it induced significant
T-cell depletion in repeat dosing, and was found safe and well
tolerated (12). This profile led to the notion that zanolimumab
treatment might provide benefit in T-cell malignancies, and the
mAb was entered into clinical trials for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; ref. 13) and nodal T-cell lymphoma (14).
The mechanisms responsible for decreasing the number of
circulating CD4+ T cells for CD4 mAb in general, and zanolimumab
in particular, have not been elucidated. Possible nonexclusive
mechanisms include the compartmentalization of CD4+ T cells;
induction of Fc receptor (FcR)–mediated effector functions, such as
complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC; ref. 15) and antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; ref. 16); CD4 receptor
down-modulation (16–19); inhibition of T-cell activation (16, 18);
and induction of apoptosis (20–22).
The inhibitory effects of CD4 mAb on T-cell activation have
received much attention. It has long been known that binding of
CD4 in the absence of T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation results in
decreased TCR-stimulated proliferation, cytokine production, and
activation marker expression (23, 24). The cytoplasmic tail of CD4
is associated noncovalently with the p56lck tyrosine kinase (25) and
during T-cell activation through the CD4/TCR complex, the
juxtaposition of CD4/p56lck and the TCR initiates the TCR signaling
cascade. p56lck phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs located in the CD3~ and CD3q chains (26, 27),
resulting in the recruitment and activation of ZAP-70 (26, 28).
ZAP-70 activation leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of
several adaptor proteins, such as the linker for activation of T cells
(LAT; ref. 29), thereby coupling the TCR to downstream activation
signals. Inhibition of T-cell activation by anti-CD4 has thus been
suggested to occur by inhibiting the necessary p56lck-mediated
costimulation (30).
In the present study, we describe the inhibition of T cells by
zanolimumab both in vivo and in vitro and show that this
therapeutic mAb exerts its inhibitory actions via several different,
nonexclusive, and sequential mechanisms.

supplied by J. Nunes (Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France).

Clinical Study Designs
Psoriasis. A multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group phase II study of zanolimumab was conducted in patients
with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. The patients were randomized
to either placebo, 40 mg zanolimumab, 80 mg zanolimumab, or 120 mg
zanolimumab s.c. once weekly for 14 weeks.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The efficacy and safety of zanolimumab
in patients with refractory CTCL have been assessed in two, phase II,
multicenter, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled clinical studies. Patients
with treatment refractory CD4+ CTCL (mycosis fungoides, n = 38; Sézary
syndrome, n = 9) received 17 weekly infusions of zanolimumab (early-stage
patients, 280 or 560 mg; advanced-stage patients, 280 or 980 mg). Included
are the data available from this study.
Leukocytes characterized by the following immunologic markers were
assessed by means of flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson): CD3+
T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells. Staining for CD4 was done with RPA-T4, a mAb
directed against a distinct CD4 epitope and noncompetitive with
zanolimumab.

Complement Deposition on Cells
CD4+ T cells were purified via negative selection using magnetic beads
(Dynal T Cell Negative Isolation kit, Dynal Biotech GmbH) from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated by lymphoprep density centrifugation from human peripheral blood or buffy coats. Next, cells were
incubated with various concentrations of zanolimumab or OKT3 mAb. For
analysis of C1q binding or C4c deposition, cells were incubated with human
serum followed by staining with FITC-labeled C1q or C4c mAb. For
determination of preferential binding of complement to CD45RA+ and
CD45RO+ cells, cells were also stained with the appropriate ( fluorochrome
labeled) CD45 mAb. Cell-associated fluorescence was detected by flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson).

Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
Total CD4+ T cells, CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ subsets, and natural killer
(NK) cells were isolated from blood bank leukopheresis packs obtained
from healthy donors of both sexes (National Blood Service, Brentwood,
Essex, United Kingdom). CD4+ T cells or NK cells were isolated using the
appropriate enrichment RosetteSep cocktail (25 AL/mL; Stemcell Technologies, Inc.). Cells were separated by lymphoprep (Axis Shield) and
resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin and
rested for 1 h at 37jC, 5% CO2. CD45RA+ and CD45R0+ T-cell subsets were
isolated by negative selection using the relevant StemSep human CD4+
T-cell enrichment kit (Stemcell Technologies). Cell purity was routinely >90%.
ADCC was done using autologous purified T cells and NK cells using
zanolimumab or a control hIgG1 as described previously (32).

CD4 Receptor Down-modulation
The capacity of zanolimumab to down-regulate CD4 in the presence of
effector cells was studied with PBMC-derived CD4+ T cells ( for isolation, see

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

CDC) or SUP-T1 cells and with or without the addition of PBMC-derived
monocytes (Dyna Monocyte Negative Isolation kit) or TPH-1 cells. PBMC or
SUP-T1 cells were incubated with a concentration range of zanolimumab,
zanolimumab-F(ab¶)2 fragments (SUP-T1), zanolimumab-Fab (SUP-T1), or
the negative control HuMab-KLH. When appropriate, effector cells
were added to an effector cell:target cell ratio of 10:1, 5:1, or 4:1. IFNg
(concentration range, 125–1,000 Ag/mL) was added and cells were
incubated overnight. Cells were stained for CD4 with fluorochrome-labeled
M-T477 (noncompetitive antibody from BD PharMingen) and a target cell
selection marker. Cell-associated fluorescence was assessed by flow
cytometry.

Proliferation Assays
Tetanus toxin–specific T-cell proliferation. PBMC ( for isolation, see
CDC) were stimulated with 10 Ag/mL tetanus toxoid, incubated with or
without zanolimumab for 5 or 6 days, and incubated with 0.5 ACi/well
[3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 18 to 20 h. Cells were harvested
(Filter Mate Cell harvester, Packard, via Perkin-Elmer) and [3H]thymidine
incorporation was measured (Topcount NXT microplate scintillation
counter, Packard).
OKT3 and OKT3/anti-CD28 induced T-cell proliferation. Tissue
culture plates were coated with OKT3 with or without 1 Ag/mL anti-CD28
overnight at 4jC and washed once with PBS, and 2  105 per well CD4+
T cells were added ( for isolation method, see ADCC). Soluble zanolimumab
was added, and cells were incubated at 37jC for 48 h, then pulsed with
1 ACi [3H]thymidine for a further 24 h, and harvested onto glass fiber filter
plates (Perkin-Elmer Instruments). [3H]thymidine incorporation was
measured by scintillation counting. Samples for cytokine assays were
removed at 48 h.

Activation Marker Expression
CD4+ T cells (106) were incubated on 0.1 or 0.5 Ag/mL plastic
immobilized OKT3 for 72 h with or without zanolimumab. Cells were
resuspended and washed twice in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer,
stained with CD25 FITC and CD69PE mAb (BD Biosciences), and analyzed
by flow cytometry.

Cell Stimulation and Immunoprecipitation

CD4+ T cells (1  107 for whole-cell lysates or 3  107 for
immunoprecipitates) were preincubated with 20 Ag/mL zanolimumab for
10 min at 37jC. Cells were washed once before stimulation with 10 Ag/mL
anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) or isotype control immobilized onto 0.1-Am latex
beads (Sigma) at 37jC for the indicated time points. Samples were pelleted
and lysed as described by Harding et al. (30). Lysates were precleared using
protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with immunoprecipitating antibody overnight at 4jC before precipitation with protein
G-Sepharose. For SH2C-RasGAP-GST precipitations, lysates were precleared
using glutathione agarose beads (Amersham) bound to an empty GST
vector. Cleared lysates were added to 10 AL glutathione agarose beads
bound to 10 Ag SH2C-RasGAP-GST and incubated overnight with inversion
at 4jC. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer before SDS-PAGE
analysis. For experiments using the Src kinase inhibitors PP2 or
damnacanthal (Merck Biosciences), cells were preincubated with the
inhibitor for 45 min at 37jC before exposure to zanolimumab for 5 min
before lysis and Dok-1 precipitation.

Immunoblotting
Immunoprecipitates were separated by 7% to 15% gradient gel SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting was done as described by Harding et al. (30).

In vitro Kinase Assays

CD4-associated p56lck in vitro tyrosine kinase assays were carried out by
incubating CD4+ T cells with zanolimumab for the indicated time period
before lysis and removal of debris as described above. CD4 was
immunoprecipitated using protein G-Sepharose, and kinase assays were
done as described by Harding et al. (30). Dried membranes were exposed for
autoradiography. Once decayed, the membranes were probed with the
indicated antibodies to measure loading.

Mechanisms of Actions of a Therapeutic Antibody

Results
Depletion of CD3+CD4+ cells in vivo. Zanolimumab induces a
strong depletion of CD4+ T cells as shown in clinical trials in
patients suffering from psoriasis and CTCL (Fig. 1). Interestingly,
effective and sustained depletion from peripheral blood required
repeat dosing. In psoriasis patients exposed to zanolimumab by
weekly s.c. dosing with 40, 80, or 120 mg antibody for 14 weeks
(Fig. 1A), a gradual decline in CD4 T-cell counts was observed with
maximum depletion occurring after about 6 weeks after start of the
treatment. In CTCL, patients were exposed to higher doses of i.v.
zanolimumab (early-stage patients, 280 or 560 mg; advanced-stage
patients, 280 or 980 mg). In this study, depletion kinetics seemed
faster with maximum depletion occurring 2 to 3 weeks following
initiation of the treatment (Fig. 1B).
Fc-dependent effector mechanisms: CDC, ADCC, and CD4
down-modulation. To analyze the mechanisms of action of
zanolimumab, we did studies using primary T cells. The use of
primary T cells is important as previous studies have shown
important differences in the activity of CD4 mAb against primary
T cells and immortalized T-cell lines (19). First, CDC by zanolimumab was assessed. This, however, did not mediate cell death of
CD4+ T cells nor CD45RA+ or CD45RO+ T-cell subsets investigated
separately (data not shown). The lack of CDC could be explained by
a poor ability to induce classic pathway activation. Although the
antibody, being a hIgG1, retained the intrinsic ability to activate
complement as measured in a plate-bound assay, it neither bound
C1q (data not shown) nor fixed complement factors C4 (Fig. 2A) or
C3 (data not shown) when bound to the surface of CD4+CD45RA+
or CD4+CD45RO+ primary T cells. In contrast, a control mAb
against CD3 (OKT3) showed effective activation of complement via
the classic pathway, shown by the deposition of C4 on the T-cell
surface (Fig. 2A).
Second, we investigated the ability of zanolimumab to induce
ADCC using NK cells as effector cells. We found that zanolimumab is very effective in promoting killing of CD4+ T cells with
significant specific lysis already occurring at 10 ng/mL (Fig. 2B).
Zanolimumab promoted a stronger killing of the CD45RO+ subset
than the CD45RA+ subset at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/mL
(Fig. 2B).

Third, we examined the ability of zanolimumab to induce CD4
down-regulation. CD4 expression was investigated by flow
cytometry with a noncompeting CD4 mAb using freshly isolated
CD4+ T cells or SUP-T1 T cells. Zanolimumab dose-dependently
down-regulated CD4 from purified primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3A)
or SUP-T1 T cells (Fig. 3B), requiring the presence of IFNgactivated monocytes or a monocytic cell line. The results showed
that after 18 to 24 h, CD4 expression was reduced by 50% to 80%.
Down-modulation seemed to be Fc dependent, as incubation with
zanolimumab F(ab¶)2 fragments did not result in a reduction in
CD4 expression (Fig. 3B). At high mAb concentrations, soluble
zanolimumab failed to down-regulate CD4, possible due to
monomeric binding, resulting in a reduction of cross-linking.
Cross-linking via immobilized zanolimumab or zanolimumab
captured on a plate-bound anti-IgG antibody also down-regulated
CD4 (data not shown).
CD3-induced T-cell activation is inhibited by direct actions
of CD4 mAb. Proliferation assays were carried out using purified
primary CD4+ T cells and direct inhibitory effects of zanolimumab
were studied on cells responding to tetanus toxin and immobilized
anti-CD3 mAb OKT3. Zanolimumab was a potent inhibitor of
TCR-stimulated T-cell proliferation both in antigen-dependent
(tetanus toxin induced; Fig. 4A) and in antigen-independent (antiCD3 induced) T-cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Similar inhibitory
effects on anti-CD3–induced T-cell proliferation were found for
interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 production (Fig. 4C). Optimal inhibition
of production of these cytokines occurred at saturating concentrations of 1 Ag/mL zanolimumab. It has been shown that CD28
costimulation may prevent the inhibition of T-cell activation by
CD4 antibodies (33, 34). We therefore carried out proliferation
assays with OKT3 in the presence of immobilized CD28 mAb.
Figure 4B shows that proliferation was still inhibited by zanolimumab, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent than without CD28
costimulation. Thus, CD28 costimulation was unable to effectively
prevent the inhibitory actions of zanolimumab.
Finally, experiments were carried out to assess the inhibition of
T-cell activation by examining expression of activation markers.
This study shows a reduction in the fraction of CD4+ T cells
expressing CD25 and CD69 after 72 h of OKT3 stimulation in the

presence of zanolimumab. The percentage of cells expressing CD69
or CD25 was inhibited by up to approximately 40% to 50% (data
not shown).
Rapid inhibition of TCR signal transduction by zanolimumab. TCR stimulation results in the induction of tyrosine
phosphorylation of a wide range of intracellular proteins.
Figure 5A (top) shows that exposure of primary T cells to soluble
zanolimumab followed by TCR stimulation (immobilized CD3
mAb) caused a generalized inhibition of protein phosphorylation
within minutes. Analysis of whole-cell lysates in immunoblots,
probed for phosphotyrosine, showed that phosphorylation of
proteins of 21 and 23 kDa was markedly inhibited. Immunoblotting
with an antibody specific for TCR~ identified these proteins as the
p21 and p23 phosphoisomers of TCR~ , with the proportion of
phosphorylated TCR~ being small compared with the nonphosphorylated fraction of this protein (migrating at 16 kDa; Fig. 5A,
bottom). The TCR-stimulated generation of both phosphoisomers
was reduced by f50% by exposure to zanolimumab (calculated by
assessing densitometric values normalized for loading, relative to
values observed after 2 min of CD3 stimulation in the absence of
zanolimumab). Because phosphorylation of the TCR~ chain is
critical for activation of the downstream tyrosine kinase ZAP-70
(26), we assessed ZAP-70 activation by measuring phosphorylation

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

of Tyr319. Figure 5B shows that zanolimumab caused a reduction of
50% in TCR-stimulated ZAP-70 phosphorylation at Tyr319, comparable with the extent of inhibition of TCR~ phosphorylation.
Next, we investigated three downstream signaling pathways that
play critical roles in T-cell activation and their differentiation into
effector populations. Figure 5C shows that zanolimumab inhibited
activation of both the Erk1/2 and p38 serine/threonine kinase
pathways to a comparable extent (f50%), although inhibition of
the Erk1/2 pathway was only reproducibly apparent at later time
points (5–30 min). The AKT/protein kinase B kinase signaling
pathway, downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, was also
investigated. Figure 5C shows that CD3 stimulation of AKT,
assessed by immunoblotting of its activation-dependent phosphoSer473 phosphorylation site, was inhibited by f50% following T-cell
exposure to zanolimumab. In summary, zanolimumab inhibits the
very earliest CD3-stimulated activation events by f50%, and a
comparable level of inhibitory action is thereby transmitted to
multiple downstream signaling pathways, including Erk1/2, p38,
and AKT.
Zanolimumab stimulates CD4-associated p56lck, Dok-1, and
SHIP-1 phosphorylation. Given that CD4 ligation has long been
known to activate the p56lck tyrosine kinase (35), it might seem
counterintuitive that zanolimumab causes a marked reduction in

Mechanisms of Actions of a Therapeutic Antibody

two well-established p56lck substrates: TCR~ and ZAP-70 (Fig. 5).
We therefore examined p56lck kinase activation kinetics following
binding of zanolimumab and compared them to activation through
anti-CD3 stimulation. Interestingly, zanolimumab caused rapid
stimulation (2–2.5 times maximal increase) of CD4-associated
p56lck tyrosine kinase activity following CD4 ligation, including
p56lck autophosphorylation (Fig. 6A, top). The rapid activation of
phosphorylation by anti-CD4 binding was confirmed by assessing
phosphorylation of a-casein as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 6A,
middle top ). Optimal stimulation was apparent at 5 min,
comparable with the time at which optimal CD3-induced TCR~
phosphorylation was observed (cf. Fig. 5A). Consistent with these
results, probing of the membrane using a phosphospecific antibody
showed that phosphorylation of the phospho-Tyr394 autophosphorylation site of p56lck was optimal (3.7 times increase) at 5 min
(Fig. 6A, middle). Reprobing for Lck and CD4 enabled values to be
quantified and normalized for loading (Fig. 6A, middle bottom and
bottom). In conclusion, CD4 ligation using zanolimumab causes
p56lck activation with kinetics very similar to those observed when
a CD3 mAb is used to stimulate p56lck-dependent intracellular
protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5).
As zanolimumab increased p56lck activity 2- to 3-fold, whereas
phosphorylation of p56lck substrates TCR~ and ZAP-70 was
decreased (Fig. 5A and B), we hypothesized that the activated
kinase couples directly to one or more inhibitory signaling
pathways. Potential candidates for such regulation are the adaptor
molecule Dok-1, thought to be involved in down-regulating Rasmitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (36) and the inositol
5-phosphatase SHIP-1. Phosphorylated Dok-1 was precipitated

using a GST construct containing the COOH-terminal SH2 domain
of RasGAP, which only binds to Dok-1 when it is phosphorylated.
Figure 6B shows that zanolimumab induced significant Dok-1
tyrosine phosphorylation (f6-fold increase; calculated by densitometric values normalized for GST loading) within 5 min of CD4
ligation. Furthermore, SHIP-1 phosphorylation was also enhanced
up to 3-fold (densitometric values normalized for SHIP-1 loading;
Fig. 6C). Previous findings suggest that Dok-1 association with
RasGAP is dependent on p56lck tyrosine kinase activity (37). We
therefore incubated cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 and the more
specific p56lck inhibitor damnacanthal and found that the amount
of Dok-1 that precipitated with SH2C-RasGAP-GST was reduced by
60% or more (Fig. 6D). Overall, these results indicate that CD4
ligation with zanolimumab causes p56lck kinase activation,
resulting in increased Dok-1 and SHIP-1 phosphorylation, thereby
coupling CD4 to pathways that lead to direct inhibitory effects of
CD4 mAbs on T-cell activation.

Discussion
The fully human CD4 antibody, zanolimumab, has been assessed
in clinical trials in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis and psoriasis, in which it induced a profound T-cell
depletion. Zanolimumab was found to be safe and well tolerated.
The effective in vivo depletion of CD4+ cells in humans makes
zanolimumab a relevant candidate for the development of
immunotherapeutic approaches against T-cell lymphomas. Zanolimumab has already shown promising results in immunotherapy
of CTCL with a response rate at the higher doses of 50% to 75% and

presence or absence of THP-1 cells. The CD4
expression levels were measured using a

representative of four different experiments.

median response duration of more than 10 months (13) and is
currently in clinical development in CTCL (pivotal study) and nodal
T-cell lymphoma (phase II). The present study shows that
zanolimumab kills and inhibits T cells via several different but
nonexclusive mechanisms. Zanolimumab might intervene in the
pathogenesis of CTCL both by depleting CD4+ tumor cells and by
inhibiting the interaction of dendritic cells and lymphoma cells
residing in the skin, an interaction suggested to be critical for
continued tumor cell activation (38). Direct inhibitory effects on
T-cell signaling pathways, as well as induction of Fc-mediated

effector function, may therefore play a role in the clinical efficacy of
this therapeutic mAb.
A difference is noted in the rate of CD4+CD3+ T-cell depletion
between psoriasis patients treated with 40 to 120 mg zanolimumab
(s.c.) once weekly and CTCL patients treated with 280 to 960 mg
zanolimumab (i.v.) once weekly. Although it cannot be excluded
that differences between patient groups or route of administration
affect the depletion observed, it is most likely that the higher
dosing in CTCL patients is mainly responsible for the more rapid
depletion. Indeed, a subanalysis of CTCL patients dosed with 280
mg zanolimumab compared with patients dosed with 560 or 960
mg showed a stronger decline in peripheral blood T cells at the
higher doses (13).
The inhibitory mechanisms of action of zanolimumab include
both very rapid mechanisms leading to immediate inhibition of
signaling, observed within minutes following binding, and
Fc-dependent mechanisms, acting with intermediate (hours) to
slow kinetics (days). Zanolimumab does not bind or activate
complement when bound to CD4 on the surface of primary T cells,
although complement-binding ELISAs indicate that the Fc part of
zanolimumab has an intrinsic capability to interact with complement. Interestingly, poor recruitment of complement has been
described for all known CD4 mAbs of the hIgG1 isotype, including
the chimerized, primatized, or humanized CD4-specific antibodies:
priliximab, keliximab, and mAb 4162W94 (16–18). Several of these
CD4 antibodies recognize epitopes similar to leu3a, a murine
antibody that induces CDC efficiently (15). This difference between
human and murine CD4 mAb is currently not understood. However,
it is well known that differences in antigen fine specificity may result
in dramatic differences in the ability of mAb to induce complementmediated lysis as, for example, shown for CD20 mAb (39).
In contrast, zanolimumab induces potent ADCC of both
CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ subpopulations of primary CD4+ T cells
at relatively low concentrations. We noted that CD45RO+ primary
T cells were more sensitive to NK-mediated killing in vitro than
naive CD45RA+ cells (Fig. 2). This increased sensitivity correlates
with a more profound depletion of CD45RO+ T cells in vivo as
reported in patients who were exposed short-term (4 weekly
infusions) to zanolimumab (12). Following longer-term treatment
(14 weeks), maximal depletion of both subsets was similar.
Consistent with the short-term treatment results, however,
depletion of CD45RO+ cells occurred more rapidly compared with
CD45RA+ cells (data not shown). Differences between T-cell subsets
in susceptibility to ADCC have been observed before. Previously,
we have shown that CD4+CD45RO+ T cells are also more sensitive
to ADCC by alefacept, a fusion protein of the extracellular domain
of leukocyte function antigen-3 and the Fc portion of IgG1 (32).
One possible explanation for our findings is that CD45RO+ T cells
express more ligand for a NK cell–activating receptor and/or less
ligand for a NK cell inhibitory receptor than CD45RA+ T cells.
Further work is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism,
which may be relevant for differences in response rates to
zanolimumab between patients.
The zanolimumab-induced partial CD4 down-regulation seems
to require CD4 clustering on the T-cell surface, which can be
artificially induced by plate-immobilized zanolimumab at high
concentrations or by zanolimumab in the presence of FcR-bearing
effector cells. Most IgG1 isotype CD4 mAbs down-modulate CD4
over time (16–19). It has been suggested that receptor modulation
can be caused by internalization (40), as well as by stripping of CD4
from cell surfaces (16). The ability to down-modulate CD4

Mechanisms of Actions of a Therapeutic Antibody

expression varies among CD4 antibodies. The Fc-dependent downmodulation of CD4 from the cell surface observed in the presence
of zanolimumab could provide long-term inhibition of T-cell
signaling and thereby benefit antitumor therapy, as described, for
example, for epidermal growth factor receptor mAb (41). In Fig. 3, it
is noted that CD4 expression on primary T cells, but not on SUP-T1
cells, seems to increase on incubation with zanolimumab in the
absence of cross-linking. A difference between SUP-T1 compared
with primary T cells is its very low expression of CD3/TCR. We have
shown above that zanolimumab sequesters CD4 away for the CD3/
TCR complex. It may be that this sequestration on primary T cells
increases the availability of the epitopes for the CD4-detecting
antibody MT-477.
Zanolimumab inhibits T-cell activation by two distinct pathways.
First, it exerts a negative inhibitory effect on one of the earliest
biochemical events in the TCR signaling cascade, the phosphorylation of ITAM signaling motifs within the TCR~ chains (Fig. 5A),
consistent with our previous findings using YHB.46 (34). It seems
that once TCR~ phosphorylation is reduced by f50%, multiple
downstream signals are likewise inhibited to a comparable extent

(Figs. 4C and 5C). Intriguingly, independent CD4 ligation induces
an enhanced stimulation of CD4-associated p56lck kinase activity
over the exact time span at which CD3-stimulated TCR~ and ZAP70 phosphorylation is most inhibited, suggesting that the activated
p56lck does not have effective access to its TCR~ and ZAP-70
substrates. These data are consistent with sequestration of CD4
and a pool of associated p56lck molecules, which can then no
longer be recruited into juxtaposition with the TCR.
Is the f50% inhibition of TCR~ phosphorylation sufficient to
explain all the inhibitory effects exerted on T-cell activation by
zanolimumab? This seems unlikely. It is therefore of importance that
our findings also provide support for inhibition of T cells via the
transmission of direct inhibitory intracellular signals following CD4
binding. Treatment of T cells with zanolimumab induced phosphorylation of both Dok-1 and SHIP-1 (Fig. 6B and C). It has been
reported that Dok-1 and p56lck are associated via an SH2-mediated
interaction, which results in phosphorylation of the Dok-1 molecule
(42). In the present work, Dok-1 phosphorylation was reduced by
p56lck kinase inhibitors (Fig. 6D), consistent with the notion that
CD4-stimulated p56lck causes the increased Dok-1 phosphorylation.

Figure 5. Zanolimumab inhibits initiation of TCR signal transduction and downstream signals in CD4+ T cells. Purified CD4+ T cells were incubated with (+) or
without ( ) zanolimumab for 10 min before incubation with mouse IgG1 (0 min) or OKT3-coated latex beads at 37jC for the times shown. Cells were lysed before
samples were split into two and proteins were separated by 7% to 15% gradient SDS-PAGE. A, one membrane was then immunoblotted with the phosphotyrosine mAb
4G10 before stripping (top ) and reprobing with LAT (middle ) and TCR~ antibodies (bottom ). B and C, the second membrane was probed with phospho-ZAP-70
(B) and phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies, phospho-p38, and phospho-AKT (C) and followed by stripping and reprobing with ZAP-70, Erk1/2, p38, and AKT, respectively,
to assess loading. Results for the experiments are representative of four different experiments.

Figure 6. Zanolimumab induces p56lck-dependent
phosphorylation of Dok-1 and SHIP-1.
A, CD4-associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity
is increased after CD4 ligation. Purified CD4+ T
cells were incubated with zanolimumab, and CD4
was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates,
followed by in vitro kinase assays in the presence
of a-casein before transfer to an immunoblotting
membrane. CD4-p56lck autophosphorylation (top )
and phosphorylated a-casein (middle top ).
Membranes were blotted for pY-394-p56lck and
stripped and reprobed for both p56lck and CD4 as
loading controls (middle, middle bottom , and
bottom ). B, Dok-1 phosphorylation is increased
after CD4 ligation. Cells treated with zanolimumab
were lysed and precleared with glutathione
agarose beads coupled to an empty GST construct
before Dok-1 was precipitated using a GST
construct of the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of
RasGAP (SH2C-RasGAP-GST). Samples were
blotted with Dok-1 and GST antibody. C, SHIP-1
phosphorylation is increased after CD4 ligation.
Cells were treated with either 10 Ag/mL
zanolimumab for 10 min before immunoblotting
whole-cell lysates with a phosphospecific SHIP-1
antibody. D, phosphorylation of Dok-1 is
dependent on the action of Src family kinases.
CD4+ T cells were preincubated with the Src family
inhibitors PP2 or damnacanthal (DAM ) for 45 min
before treatment with zanolimumab for 5 min
and Dok-1 phosphorylation was then measured as
in C . Results are representative of four different
experiments.

Activation of Dok-1 and SHIP-1 may inhibit CD4+ T-cell
activation processes in two possible ways. First, SHIP-1 is known
to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3, generating PI(3, 4)P2 (43). Because
AKT requires PI(3,4,5)P3 for its targeting to the plasma membrane
and full activation (44), SHIP-1 stimulation should inhibit the AKT
pathway, consistent with our findings (Fig. 5C). This is comparable
with the FcgRIIB signaling pathway in which SHIP-1 has likewise
been shown to inhibit AKT activation (45). The significance of
inhibition of AKT stimulation for activation is that this pathway
has been implicated in the induction of transcription factors
critical for IL-2 gene induction, such as NFAT, activator protein-1,
and nuclear factor-nB (46–48). Second, the activation of SHIP-1
and Dok-1 could lead to dysregulation of cytoskeletal changes
(22, 32, 35, 45, 49), perhaps explaining the inability of CD4-p56lck to
target its normal kinase substrates following CD4 ligation. Taken
together, our findings on Dok-1 and SHIP-1 stimulation provide
attractive mechanisms that explain the rapid and potent inhibitory
actions of zanolimumab following CD4 ligation and consequent
p56lck activation.

Overall, the present study suggests that zanolimumab uses several
distinct and sequential mechanisms of action, all of which have the
effect of inactivating or deleting T cells. The mechanisms include a
very rapid inhibition of TCR signal transduction (minutes) brought
about by uncoupling of p56lck from the early initiating events of TCR
signaling, allowing the kinase to transmit direct inhibitory signals
mediated via Dok-1 and SHIP-1 that may also reduce AKT activation.
These effects combine with pronounced Fc-dependent effects which
act with intermediate (ADCC-mediated deletion of CD4+ T cells) and
slow kinetics (CD4 receptor down-modulation).
