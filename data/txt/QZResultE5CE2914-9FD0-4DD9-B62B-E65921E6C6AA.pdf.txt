Abstract
Kaposi sarcoma originates from endothelial cells and it is one of the most overt angiogenic tumors. In SubSaharan Africa, where HIV and the Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are endemic, Kaposi sarcoma
is the most common cancer overall, but model systems for disease study are insufﬁcient. Here, we report the
development of a novel mouse model of Kaposi sarcoma, where KSHV is retained stably and tumors are elicited
rapidly. Tumor growth was sensitive to speciﬁc allosteric inhibitors (rapamycin, CCI-779, and RAD001) of the
pivotal cell growth regulator mTOR. Inhibition of tumor growth was durable up to 130 days and reversible. mTOR
blockade reduced VEGF secretion and formation of tumor vasculature. Together, the results show that mTOR
inhibitors exert a direct anti-Kaposi sarcoma effect by inhibiting angiogenesis and paracrine effectors, suggesting
their application as a new treatment modality for Kaposi sarcoma and other cancers of endothelial origin. Cancer

Introduction
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an aggressive cancer of the endothelial cell origin affecting immunocompromised patients, the
elderly, as well as children and adults in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer overall (men and
women) in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi,
Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, and parts of South Africa (1).
Kaposi sarcoma is an AIDS-deﬁning malignancy. It is regularly
seen as a solid organ transplant-associated cancer in Southern
Europe, the Mediterranean region, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia
(2). Chang and colleagues identiﬁed Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in any and all forms of Kaposi
sarcoma (3). For lack of known tumor-speciﬁc target pathways,
Kaposi sarcoma is treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, now
predominantly liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Although, initial
response rates are reasonable, subsequent failures are not
uncommon (4). Drug resistance has also been documented.
Doxil is associated with toxicity and has a lifetime dose limit.
This motivated our experiments to establish a novel animal
model for drug evaluation and to explore the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway as a new target of intervention in Kaposi sarcoma.

Morphologically, Kaposi sarcoma lesions appear as ﬂat
dermal "patches" upon initial presentation. As the lesion
progresses, it goes from patch to plaque to nodule and the
initial red color takes on a darker, purplish hue. The characteristic color of these lesions is indicative of the high degree of
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Angiogenesis in Kaposi sarcoma begins even before the
formation of a visible lesion. Hundred percent of the Kaposi
sarcoma tumor cells carry KSHV and express the KSHV
latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) as the deﬁning
biomarker for Kaposi sarcoma (5, 6). The tumor cells also
express other viral proteins that promote tumor cell growth
cell-autonomously or through induction of soluble factors,
which act through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.
vGPCR is the KSHV homolog to human interleukin (IL)-8
receptor; it can signal in the absence of ligand binding, thus
resulting in a constitutively active state (7–9). vGPCR can
activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as well as induce
VEGF (10). Other viral signaling molecules, which can activate
PI3K signaling, include K1 and K15 (11, 12). As multiple (K1,
K15, vGPCR, etc.) viral signaling molecules converge on the
PI3K pathway, we reasoned that Kaposi sarcoma is addicted to
this pathway and that kinases within this pathway represent
promising drug targets.
PI3K is activated by membrane receptor signaling and
phosphorylates its downstream target Akt. Phosphorylated
Akt in turn activates the mTOR kinases, which have multiple
targets that support cell growth (reviewed in refs. 13, 14). We,
along with other groups, have shown that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is constitutively activated in Kaposi sarcoma–
infected cells as well as in vGPCR- and K1-driven cell culture
models (12, 15–18).
Clinical observations also support the importance of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in Kaposi sarcoma. Stallone and

colleagues (19) reported that switching the immune suppressive regimen of renal transplant patients from cyclosporine A,
which inhibits cyclophillin in T cells, to rapamycin (sirolimus),
which inhibits mTOR (20), resulted in regression of Kaposi
sarcoma lesions. Others have reported similar cases (21–23); a
few exceptions have also been noted (24, 25). Most recently, we
completed a pilot study of AIDS-KS and found long-term
disease stabilization or partial responses in 6 of 7 (85%)
HIV-positive patients (26). These clinical studies allowed for
2 alternative hypotheses about the mechanism of rapamycin
and other allosteric mTOR inhibitors (everolimus and temsirolimus), the so-called rapalogs (reviewed in ref. 27). First,
rapalogs changed either the type or the level of immune
suppression and Kaposi sarcoma tumor regression was secondary. This hypothesis is supported by the sometimes spontaneous regression of Kaposi sarcoma after immune reconstitution of patients with AIDS or after immune suppression
tampering of transplant recipients. Second, rapalogs have
direct antitumor effects as had been shown for everolimus in
renal cell cancer and temsirolimus in mantle cell lymphoma
(28–30). These antitumor effects could be impacting the tumor
cell directly or the supporting vasculature. Unique to Kaposi
sarcoma, both the tumor cell itself and the tumor-feeding
blood vessels are of endothelial origin.
To decide among these competing hypotheses, we established a novel mouse model of Kaposi sarcoma, which is
dependent on the KSHV virus, and used it to evaluate a battery
of structurally different, U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved mTOR inhibitors: rapamycin/sirolimus, everolimus/
RAD-001, and temsirolimus/CCI-779. As controls, we used
cyclosporine A and FK506 (tacrolimus), which is a macrolide
that is structurally related to rapamycin, but does not inhibit
mTOR (31). The latter control drugs modulate the immune
status as efﬁciently as rapamycin but have no activity against
mTOR. We found that all 3 rapalogs were equally effective in
multiple Kaposi sarcoma models. Rapalogs inhibited VEGF-1
secretion and arrested growth in immune-deﬁcient mice by
reducing intratumor ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, tumor
growth, and neoangiogenesis. In this model, rapamycin was
superior to doxorubicin.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium supplemented with 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate,
100 U/mL penicillin G (Life Technologies), and 10% FBS at 37 C
in 5% CO2. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) or derived in our laboratory. The
cells have been tested and authenticated. The method used was
whole genome Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. The cells were last
tested by the aforementioned method at submission within
receipt or resuscitation from stock. The L1T2 cell line will be
submitted to the ATCC.
Quantitative PCR for KSHV genome
Genomic DNA was extracted using Wizard SV Genomic
DNA Puriﬁcation System, as per manufacturer's protocol

2236

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

(Promega) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect
the viral genome in the different Kaposi sarcoma cell lines as
per our previous publications (32).
CGH analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted as above and hybridized to the
6.0 GeneChip Human Mapping Array that uses more than
906,600 known single-nucleotide polymorphism and 946,000
copy number variation markers (Affymetrix). Data analysis
was conducted using Partek Genomics Suite as described
previously (33) and normalized to tert-immortalized human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were cultured overnight on glass coverslips in 6-well
plates (Falcon-BD Biosciences Inc.). They were then washed in
PBS followed by the protocol for immune ﬂuorescence as
described previously (34). Primary mouse anti-LANA (1:600
dil.; Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.), rabbit anti-S6 ribosomal
protein, Alexa Fluo 488–conjugated anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein for both S235/236 and S240/244 residues (1:200 dil.;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were used for immunoﬂuorescence. Images were taken on a LEICA DM4000B ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with a 63/1.4-0.6 numerical
aperture objective and a Q-Imaging Retiga 2000RV camera.
Raw microscopy image stacks were deconvoluted using Simple
PCI (Hamamatsu Corp.) 2D Blind Deconvolution that iteratively applies AutoQuant Imaging (Media Cybernetics, Inc.)
proprietary algorithm to remove blur and generate high clarity
images and stored as tiff ﬁles. Images were assembled in
Photoshop CS4 under MacOsX 10.7.
Tumor formation
Cells were counted, washed once in ice-cold PBS (Cellgro
Mediatech, Inc.), and indicated cell doses were diluted into 100
mL PBS and mixed with 100 mL growth factor–depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences). A total of 1  106 cells were injected
subcutaneously into the ﬂank of C.B.17-PkrdcSCID mice (Jackson Laboratory) following our previously validated procedures
(35). The mice were observed every day for the presence of
palpable tumors. Drug or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally
at the indicated dosing schedule. Tumor diameters were
determined by caliper measurements. Tumor volume was
calculated as V ¼ a  b  c, where a, b, and c are the 3
diameters (length, breadth, and width) of the tumor. The
tumors were excised from the site of injection and ﬁxed in
formalin (Fisher Diagnostics) for subsequent analysis.
Blood rapamycin quantiﬁcation
Blood was collected from the animals by cardiac puncture 48
hours after the last intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin at
either 2.5 or 5 mg/kg dose. Care was taken to ensure that blood
was directly collected into EDTA-coated tubes (BD Biosciences) to prevent any coagulation. Rapamycin levels were
determined from whole blood by high-performance liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS-MS)
using Nova_Pak columns (Waters Corp.) offering sensitivity in
the 2 to 50 ng/mL range.

mTOR in Kaposi Sarcoma

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were removed and processed as per ref. (17) and
stained using the appropriate primary antibodies: phospho-S6
ribosomal protein (Ser 235/236) monoclonal antibody (1:100
dil.) and phospho-4EBP1 (Ser 65) antibody (1:50 dil.) from Cell
Signaling Inc.. Sections were imaged using a LEICA DM LA
histology microscope (Leica) equipped with a 10/0.25 numerical aperture, a 40/0.75 numerical aperture N plan objective,
or HC PLAN APO 20/0.70 numerical aperture and Leica
DPC 480 camera. Images were stored as tiff ﬁles under Mac
OS X10.5. Staining intensity was assessed using the FRIDA
(Framework for Image Dataset Analysis) as outlined (36).
Brieﬂy, FRIDA measures the pixel intensity of the tumor
section based on a user deﬁned "positive" stain and we plotted
the square root of this total area intensity. To determine the
degree of signiﬁcance, we used ANOVA implemented in the
R statistics environment (version 2.14.1).

infection of telomerase-immortalized, umbilical cord–derived
endothelial cells (44). These cells maintain KSHV in the
absence of drug selection, secrete IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and form
tumors in nude mice, albeit slowly.
The L1T2 cell line was established from a subcutaneous
tumor that developed upon injecting TIVE-L1 cells into C.B.17PkrdcSCID mice (Fig. 1A). L1T2 retained the tumor-forming

Tumor vasculature staining
Tumor vasculature was determined using commercially
available periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining system following
manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections
were imaged, PAS staining quantiﬁed using FRIDA, and signiﬁcance determined as earlier.
VEGF quantiﬁcation
VEGF levels in the culture supernatants were determined
using commercially available VEGF ELISA assay as per manufacturer's recommendations (PeproTech). The biologic activity of secreted VEGF (Supplementary Fig. S1) was ascertained
by sprouting assay as described (37).

Results
A robust, human, KSHV-positive mouse model for Kaposi
sarcoma
Despite the identiﬁcation of Kaposi sarcoma nearly 2 decades ago, there is a dearth of preclinical models for Kaposi
sarcoma. Explants from Kaposi sarcoma biopsies have been
successful to a limited degree (2 cell lines in 20 years; refs. 38,
39), but rapidly lose the viral episome. Thus, they no longer
represent the full spectrum of molecular interactions present
in the primary tumor. The best-characterized example until
recently was the SLK cell line. It was isolated from an oral
Kaposi sarcoma biopsy of an HIV-negative male (38) and at the
time of tissue procurement expressed KSHV LANA and exhibited the Kaposi sarcoma–deﬁning spindle cell morphology.
KSHV was lost, but the spindle cell morphology was retained
and SLK cells form tumors in immunodeﬁcient mice. This
year it was shown that the SLK cell line used in laboratories
throughout the world has in fact become contaminated with
the kidney carcinoma cell line Caki-1; a second Kaposi sarcoma–derived cell line KS-Y1 was also shown to be contaminated
by an irrelevant cell line (40). This leaves the ﬁeld bereft of
human tumor models for this cancer.
De novo infection of human endothelial cells in culture by
KSHV is possible, but here too the virus is rapidly lost unless
maintained under drug selection (37, 41–43). The exceptions
are 2 cell lines (TIVE-E1 and TIVE-L1) that were derived by

potential of the parental cell line. They induced uniform, fast
growing, subcutaneous tumors in C.B.17-PkrdcSCID (Fig. 1B)
and nu/nu mice (data not shown). At the 106 cells dose, 100% of
the animals developed palpable tumors after only 2 days, which
grew exponentially for up to 21 days (Table 1). This phenotype
held true at the 105 cells dose as well (data not shown). The cells
express the viral latent protein LANA in the typical punctate
pattern (Fig. 1C). The punctate pattern requires the presence of

KSHV terminal repeats, which bind LANA (45), and the socalled "LANA-dots" correlate directly with the number of
viral episomes (46). The L1T2-induced tumors were highly
proliferative as shown by Ki-67 staining (Fig. 2A and B) and
in the tumor-retained expression of the endothelial marker
genes CD31 (Fig. 2E and F) and VEGF-R3 (Fig. 2C and D) as
well as LANA (Fig. 2G and H). The cells retained the
complete viral episome as shown by real-time qPCR with

C.B.17-PkrdcSCID mice that lack any immune effector cells with
rapamycin and its various analogs. First, we tested TIVE-E1
and TIVE-L1 cells, which had previously been established as
model systems to study Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis in nu/nu
mice (44). TIVE E1 and L1 represent 2 independent clones of
telomerase-immortalized, KSHV-infected endothelial cells,
each of which sustained independent chromosome rearrangements (Fig. 2J). TIVE-L1 (Fig. 3A) and TIVE-E1 (Fig. 3B) cells
were injected subcutaneously and upon formation of palpable
tumors, animals received rapamycin at 3 mg/kg/d 3 times a
week, or vehicle. Figure 3A and B compares tumor growth in
rapamycin and mock-treated animals. In each cohort, drugtreated animals showed signiﬁcantly smaller tumors than
mock treatment (P < 0.05 by repeated measurements, random
effects model). Next, we tested KSHV-negative SLK cells, which
thus far were the standard for preclinical drug testing in Kaposi
sarcoma (Fig. 3C). Upon formation of palpable tumors, animals
received rapamycin at 2.5 mg/kg/d 3 times a week, 5 mg/kg/d 3
times a week, or vehicle. At 5 mg/kg, rapamycin was very
effective against tumor progression; however, it adversely
affected overall health of the animals (Table 1). At 2.5 mg/kg,
rapamycin was equally as effective in tumor inhibition as
5 mg/kg/d dose together with improvement in survival and
overall health (P < 0.05 by repeated measurements random
effects model). Finally, we tested KSHV-positive L1T2 cells
(Fig. 3D). Upon formation of palpable tumors, animals received
rapamycin at 2.5 mg/kg/d 3 times a week or vehicle. Again,
rapamycin effectively inhibited tumor growth compared with
vehicle control (P < 0.05 by repeated measurements random
effects model).
To establish equivalency among the different rapalogs, we
also tested temsirolimus and everolimus in the L1T2 system.
Each resulted in signiﬁcant tumor inhibition. We also tested
the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor PP242 (Table 1). This
resulted in tumor reduction but was not superior to allosteric
rapalogs. FK506, which is structurally similar to rapamycin and
which like rapamycin binds FKBP (but not mTOR), had no
activity (Table 1). Table 1 is a summary of all the studies we
conducted. These show that rapalogs are efﬁcacious against
tumors, irrespective of whether they were isolated from Kaposi
sarcoma biopsies (SLK) or generated following de novo infection of endothelial cells (E1, L1, and L1T2). Single agent
rapalogs, irrespective of their particular structure, resulted in
prolonged (up to 130 days) growth inhibition. Of note, each
experiment was carried out in parallel with a similar size group
of mock-treated animals, which received the same cell aliquot.
The group size n in Table 1 refers only to the size of the
experimental group. In total, we observed signiﬁcant raplogdependent tumor inhibition in 85 animals.
Rapalog dosing presents a signiﬁcant challenge in the clinic,
especially considering that rapalogs are metabolized by the
cytochrome P450 family members in the liver (47). Even in
culture, the IC50 for rapamycin may vary more than 1,000-fold
between cancer cell lines (48). The reason is unknown and may
have as much to do with drug transport as with pathway
resistance mutations. P450 is expressed by the tumor endothelial cells within Kaposi sarcoma lesions (Roy and Dittmer;
unpublished data). Therefore, we optimized the dosing

mTOR in Kaposi Sarcoma

regimen required to obtain therapeutic drug trough levels,
while minimizing toxicity. Note that our dosing is rather
infrequent compared with other experimental designs
(16, 49), which require daily dosing. At 5 mg/kg doses of
rapamycin, the animals exhibited weight loss, lethargy, and
had to be sacriﬁced despite robust inhibition of tumor progression. At 1.5 mg/kg, the animals remained healthy throughout extended treatment, but antitumor activity was lost (data
not shown). On the basis of these data, we established the
optimal dose for long-term rapamycin treatment in C.B.17.
PKRDscid mice at 2.5 mg/kg 3 times a week. Next, we assessed
the actual levels of rapamycin in the blood stream of the
animals. Figure 2F shows that at 2.5 mg/kg doses we are able
to maintain a steady level of drug in the blood compared with 5
mg/kg (Fig. 2E) where blood levels spike early on and presumably cause drug toxicity. In summary, we established the efﬁcacy
of multiple, chemically distinct rapalogs (sirolimus/rapamycin,
temsirolimus, everolimus, etc.), and the ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitor PP242 in 4 distinct xenograft models of Kaposi sarcoma. We established 2.5 mg/kg 3 times a week as a low intensity
regimen, which resulted in long-term (>60 days) growth suppression and showed that this dosing regimen leads to sustained, systemic trough levels of 20 ng/mL, which was the target
trough level in recent clinical trials of this drug family (26).
Rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mTOR targets S6
ribosomal protein and 4E-binding protein in vivo
Having extensively validated our tumor model, we used it to
elucidate the mechanism of action of allosteric rapalogs in
Kaposi sarcoma. Phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 (S6R) protein is considered a robust readout for mTOR activation. We
treated L1T2 cells with rapamycin (5 mmol/L corresponding to
4.5 mg/mL) in culture and measured S6 phosphorylation. Figure
4 shows immunoﬂuorescence staining for total (Fig. 4A and D)
and phosphorylated S6R [pS6R; Fig. 4B and E for pS6R (Ser235/
236) and Fig. 4C and F for pS6R (Ser240/244)]. As expected, S6 is
expressed at high levels in L1T2 cells and heavily phosphorylated at both composite sites (Fig. 4A–C). Upon treatment
with rapamycin, total S6 expression remained unchanged,
whereas S6 phosphorylation was completely abolished (without loss of cell viability). This shows that rapalogs inhibit their
molecular targets in our Kaposi sarcoma-tumor model.
Because we were treating established tumors in the mouse
model where rapalogs lead to sustained growth inhibition, and
only later lead to necrosis due to lack of nutrients and oxygen
(see later), we were able to measure molecular markers of
mTOR inhibition in early tumors in vivo. The L1T2 tumor
morphology of mock-treated tumors was analogous to Kaposi
sarcoma biopsies as judged by hematoxylin and eosin stain.
The drug-treated tumors were similar, except that the interior
of the tumor mainly consisted of necrotic tissue as compared
with mock (data not shown). Treatment with rapamycin
resulted in dramatically reduced levels of pS6R (Ser235/236)
as compared with both mock and FK506 treatment (Fig. 4G–I).
In addition to pS6R, a second target of mTOR is 4EBP1 (14, 50).
Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections revealed
downregulation of 4EBP1 phosphorylated at Ser65 following
rapamycin treatment but no change in mock- and FK506-

treated tumors (Fig. 4J–L). Rapamycin reduced S6 and 4E-BP1
phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 4M, with P  0.05 by two-way
ANOVA). This shows that the molecular mechanism of action
of rapalogs in Kaposi sarcoma is the same as in other cancers,
such as KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL;
ref. 17). It validates the use of pS6 and p4E-BP1 as novel
biomarkers for rapalog therapy in Kaposi sarcoma.
Rapamycin inhibits VEGF secretion and associated
vasculature development
Kaposi sarcoma tumors are characterized by their atypical
purple color indicative of vastly increased vasculature and
angiogenesis. Furthermore, Kaposi sarcoma tumors are rich in
VEGF, IL-1b, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and other
endothelial cell growth factors (51–53). This phenotype is
recapitulated in our murine model. Rapalogs are known to
inhibit endothelial cell–mediated tumor neoangiogenesis in
addition to direct tumor growth (54, 55). We therefore hypothesized that some of the Kaposi sarcoma–speciﬁc targets of
rapamycin are paracrine growth factors involved in tumor
vasculature development. Because of the endothelial cell lineage of Kaposi sarcoma tumors, these same growth factors can

also function in an autocrine manner, which may explain the
increased sensitivity of Kaposi sarcoma to rapalogs.
VEGF is a key angiogenesis-promoting factor secreted by
Kaposi sarcoma and other tumor cells. TIVE-E1, -L1, SLK, and
L1T2 cells all secrete VEGF, as detected in the culture supernatant. We measured between 2,000 and 4,000 pg/mL in the
supernatant Kaposi sarcoma-like cells over a 48-hour period. In
comparison, KSHV-infected lymphoma cell lines secreted 200
to 400 pg/mL in the same, luminex-based, assay. The cells
secreted similarly high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 (Roy and Dittmer;
unpublished data). Rapamycin downregulated levels of VEGF
secreted by TIVE-L1 cells in culture (Fig. 5A). We conducted a
time course followed by drug washout experiment to assess
both the production and accumulation of VEGF in culture
supernatant. We detected levels of secreted VEGF (isoform A)
in cells treated with 0.5 mmol/L (0.45 mg/mL) and 5 mmol/L (4.5
mg/mL) rapamycin over 96 hours (Fig. 5A). Upon drug withdrawal, the cells recovered slowly and gradually increased
VEGF secretion. Similar results were noted for TIVE-L1, SLK,
and L1T2 cells (data not shown). For KSHV-infected BCBL-1
cells, we found that conditioned media from rapamycin-treated cells no longer supported HUVEC tubule formation

mTOR in Kaposi Sarcoma

(Supplementary Fig. S1). This shows that rapamycin inhibits
biologically active VEGF, which is an autocrine growth factor in
Kaposi sarcoma (56).
The xenograft model constitutes a much more demanding
setting than in vitro culture and requires cancer cells to
establish and maintain an optimal microenvironment for
survival. We hypothesized that reduction of growth factors
by rapalogs would have a pronounced impact on tumor
progression. To address this, we used PAS staining, which
marks the vasculature directly, rather than relying on just one
particular biomarker protein, thereby detecting the overall
physiologic impact (57, 58). Rapamycin resulted in a sustained
tumor vasculature defect (Fig. 5B). Rapamycin-treated tumors
had less ordered, less mature vessel formation compared with
mock and FK506 treatment. The tumor cells appeared in
isolated, clumped nests rather than each cell being enmeshed
in supportive stroma and vasculature with the Kaposi sarcoma–associated slit-like morphology. Quantiﬁcation of PASpositivity showed a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in staining (Fig. 5C). Rapamycin-treated tumors had signiﬁcantly
reduced branching indicative of immature vasculature and
poor angiogenesis. Because clinically Kaposi sarcoma is among
the most highly angiogenic sarcomas, second only to hemangioma, we conclude that reduction of growth of tumor supporting endothelial cells by rapalogs and inhibition of paracrine factors (such as VEGF) contributes to the efﬁcacy of the
rapalogs against this particular cancer.
Rapamycin and doxorubicin combination therapy
Having shown single-agent efﬁcacy of multiple rapalogs
against Kaposi sarcoma, we explored the efﬁcacy of rapamycin
in the adjuvant setting. Speciﬁcally, we wanted to test the
hypothesis that adding doxorubicin to rapamycin would result

in increased cytotoxicity. We conﬁrmed this hypothesis in the
cell culture model of PEL (Supplementary Fig. S2); however, the
in vivo studies yielded a surprising result. Preformed L1T2
tumors were treated with 4 different regimens: (i) 2.5 mg/kg
rapamycin [intraperitoneally (i.p.) 3 weekly], (ii) 4 mg/kg
doxorubicin (i.p. 5 weekly), (iii) 2.5 mg/kg rapamycin (i.p. 3
weekly) þ 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (i.p. 5 weekly), or (iv) mock.
Individually, both drugs inhibited tumor progression (Table 1).
Nonetheless, the combination treatment did not show synergy
or an additive effect on tumor growth. We used PAS staining to
investigate tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 6). As expected, untreated
L1T2 tumors were highly vascularized and individual cells were
neatly packed in a supportive, mesh-like vascular microenvironment (Fig. 6B and C). Rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6D and E)
destroyed the tumor vasculature (P  0.005 by Wilcox sum
rank test), which we quantiﬁed by counting the number of PASpositive branches in several tumor sections. Branch points,
deﬁned as 2 or more ﬁnger-like PAS vessels at a common point,
were averaged from 5 distinct regions for each tumor section.
Doxorubicin did not affect the tumor vasculature (Fig. 6A). The
combination treatment shows a novel phenotype: tumor cells
were nested together in relatively few islands separated by
extended thicker slit-like structures (Fig. 6H and I). This may
explain the absence of synergy between rapamycin and doxorubicin in this model. By restricting angiogenesis, rapamycin
restricts at the same time the ﬂow of nutrients and oxygen to
the tumor (resulting in growth inhibition) and the ﬂow of the
doxorubicin drug, thus limiting the efﬁcacy of the cytotoxic
drug. This result has important clinical ramiﬁcations. It argues
against simultaneous therapy of rapalogs and cytotoxic drugs,
which in the extreme may foster the emergence of drug
resistant tumor cells due to suboptimal exposure to the
cytotoxic drug.

Discussion
A large body of clinical evidence suggests that in the solid
organ transplant setting switching to a rapamycin-containing
immunosuppressive regimen leads to Kaposi sarcoma regression or lowers the risk of Kaposi sarcoma development (21–
23, 59, 60). Similar data are missing for AIDS Kaposi sarcoma,
endemic Kaposi sarcoma, or classic Kaposi sarcoma or for the
use of rapalogs as dedicated, single agent antitumor drugs
against Kaposi sarcoma. No data exist for the newer rapamycin
analogs everolimus, temsirolimus, or the ATP-competitive
inhibitors of mTOR (27). Here, we tested the hypothesis that
mTOR inhibitors have antitumor activity against Kaposi sarcoma, and we describe a new mechanism that could explain the
extraordinary sensitivity of Kaposi sarcoma to rapamycin. This
work was predicated on the development of a new human
tumor model of Kaposi sarcoma, which is robust, fast, and
mimics all the phenotypes associated with the human tumor
(Fig. 1). It was driven by the insights that (i) Kaposi sarcoma is
an endothelial cell lineage tumor (42, 61, 62), (ii) Kaposi sarcoma
is dependent on autocrine and paracrine growth factors, (iii)
extensive neoangiogenesis, and (iv) rapalogs stymy tumor
growth in common cancers by inhibiting the host endothelial
cells comprising the tumor vasculature and microenvironment
as well as through direct inhibition of tumor cell activity (14).
For the purpose of this discussion, we deﬁne rapalogs
functionally as inhibitors of mTOR, as opposed to FK506,
which has a similar chemical structure as rapamycin, but does
not bind to or inhibit mTOR. All rapalogs tested induced tumor
regression of preformed Kaposi sarcoma-like human tumors in
our xenograft model (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Rapalog efﬁcacy did
not depend on immune system modulation, as the host animals were deﬁcient for B, T, and natural killer cells and as
we achieved long-term, sustained responses with a 3 per
week dosing regimen. Rapalog efﬁcacy did not depend on the
presence of KSHV, as KSHV-negative SLK cell tumors were also
inhibited. This is expected as SLK cells exhibit the same signs of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, that is, phosphorylation of key
residues, as Kaposi sarcoma tumors (36), and as KSHV-induced
Kaposi sarcoma cell lines. Rapalogs decreased phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein and 4EBP-1 in vivo (Fig. 4), showing that
they inhibit the intended molecular targets downstream of
mTOR. The antitumor effect was reversible in vivo: upon
withdrawal of the rapalogs the tumors grew back uniformly
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, 2 chemically related drugs
cyclosporine A (data not shown) and FK506 had no antitumor
effect. This is particularly interesting as FK506 like rapamycin
also binds to FKBP12 but cannot bind mTOR (63). It supports
the speciﬁcity of action of the rapalogs. The ATP-competitive
inhibitor PP242 also inhibited tumor progression in vivo, but
was not superior to the allosteric mTOR inhibitors. This
validates mTOR as a bona ﬁde drug target in Kaposi sarcoma
and provides a solid biologic rationale for future clinical trials.

We uncovered a novel mechanism of action for mTOR
inhibitors that is speciﬁc to Kaposi sarcoma. The rapalogs
inhibited VEGF secretion by the Kaposi sarcoma tumor cells
(Fig. 3) as well as VEGF secretion in KSHV-dependent lymphomas (Supplementary Fig. S2). We surmise that the translational arrest induced by mTOR inhibition is not universal but
preferentially affects autocrine growth factors of endothelial
lineage cells and Kaposi sarcoma tumor cells. This is analogous
to the situation in PEL, where we showed previously that
rapamycin stopped lymphoma growth by inhibiting the essential autocrine growth factors IL-6 and IL-10 (17). This may
explain the differential response of different human cancers to
rapalogs. Cancers, such as Kaposi sarcoma, that still depend
heavily on proangiogenic and growth factors to sustain elevated PI3K signaling are susceptible to mTOR inhibitors.
Cancers that evolved growth factor independence such as
hormone resistant prostate cancer or estrogen receptor negative breast cancer may be less responsive to mTOR inhibitors.
Finally, we explored the combination therapy of rapamycin
with the prototypic cytostatic drug, doxorubicin, which represents the current standard of care for Kaposi sarcoma. We did
not ﬁnd any beneﬁt of combining these 2 drugs in vivo. This
represents a cautionary note in regards to combining mTOR
inhibitors with other drugs, as mTOR inhibitors may inhibit
neovascularization and sprouting of nontransformed endothelial cells (Fig. 6), thereby potentially limiting drug delivery to
the tumor.
