ABSTRACT
BCR gene fused ABL kinase is the critical driving force for the Philadelphia
Chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and has been extensively
explored as a drug target. With a structure-based drug design approach we have
discovered a novel inhibitor CHMFL-074, that potently inhibits both the native and a
variety of clinically emerged mutants of BCR-ABL kinase. The X-ray crystal structure
of CHMFL-074 in complex with ABL1 kinase (PDB ID: 5HU9) revealed a typical type
II binding mode (DFG-out) but relatively rare hinge binding. Kinome wide selectivity
profiling demonstrated that CHMFL-074 bore a high selectivity (S score(1) = 0.03)
and potently inhibited ABL1 kinase (IC50: 24 nM) and PDGFR α/β (IC50: 71 nM and
88 nM). CHMFL-074 displayed strong anti-proliferative efficacy against BCR-ABL–
driven CML cell lines such as K562 (GI50: 56 nM), MEG-01 (GI50: 18 nM) and KU812
(GI50: 57 nM). CHMFL-074 arrested cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase and induced
apoptosis in the Ph+ CML cell lines. In addition, it potently inhibited the CML patient
primary cell’s proliferation but did not affect the normal bone marrow cells. In the
CML cell K562 inoculated xenograft mouse model, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/d
of CHMFL-074 achieved a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 65% without exhibiting
apparent toxicity. As a potential drug candidate for fighting CML, CHMFL-074 is under
extensive preclinical safety evaluation now.

INTRODUCTION

Table 2). In order to further confirm these possible targets,
we first used TEL-transfused BaF3 system to verify
CHMFL-074’s inhibitory activity against the ABL1
targets (Table 1). The results demonstrated that it potently
inhibited the growth of p210 (wide type ABL1) dependent
BaF3 cells but not parental BaF3 cells (GI50: 0.164 μM
versus over 10 μM). In addition, it also potently inhibited
ABL1’s mutants such as E255K, F317L, F317I, M351T,
Q252H, Y253F but weakly inhibited H396P and almost
lost the activity against the gatekeeper mutation T315I.
Interestingly, CHMFL-074 exhibited stronger inhibitory
activity against ABL1 and related mutants than Imatinib.
We then tested a panel of other kinases that showed
strong binding affinity in the KinomeScanTM profiles
in the TEL or BCR transfused BaF3 assay system. The
results demonstrated that CHMFL-074 did not display
strong inhibitory activity against BLK, LCK, DDR1/2
but weakly inhibited RET kinase (Table 1). However,
it did potently inhibit PDGFRα/β kinase activity (GI50:
0.095 μM and 0.052 μM respectively), though it was less
active than Imatinib against them. These data suggested
that CHMFL-074 might be a potent BCR-ABL and
PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor. Further confirmation with
Invitrogen Z’LYTE biochemical assay (activity-based
assay) revealed an IC50 of 25 nM against ABL1 kinase
(Figure 1C). The Microscale Thermophoresis Technology
(MST) based assay (binding affinity assay) revealed
a binding Kd of 24 nM (Figure 1D). In the Promega’s
ADP-Glo biochemical assay (activity-based assay), it
displayed IC50s of 71 nM and 88 nM against PDGFRα
and β respectively (Figure 1C). In addition, since Imatinib
also potently inhibited c-KIT kinase, we also tested
CHMFL-074 against c-KIT. The Z’LYTE assay data
showed that it was about 12-fold less active than ABL1
kinase (IC50: 289 nM).

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a
hematological cancer of the white cells and constitutes
about 15% of adult leukemia with a diagnostic rate of
1 ~ 2/100,000 people [1]. The pivotal driving force of the
CML is the deregulation of the protein tyrosine kinase
ABL1, which get constitutively expressed and activated
due to genetic fusion of Abelson (ABL) gene with the
chromosome 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] of the break point
cluster region (BCR) gene [2, 3]. Usually the CML patients
express the 210 kDa BCR-ABL. The constitutive activation
of the fused BCR-ABL kinase leads to the growth factorsindependent proliferation and stimulate the downstream
mediators such as STAT5, CRKL and ERK to remain the
CML cells constitutive growth and survival [4]. The first
BCR-ABL inhibitor, Imatinib (Gleevec [5]), as the seminal
target therapy for the CML has achieved great clinical
success and several other ABL inhibitors such as Nilotinib
[6], Dasatinib [7], Bosutinib [8] and Ponatinib [9] have
been developed to be used as the second line therapy to
overcome a variety of the drug resistances induced by either
various of point mutations or the chronic drug treatment
induced BCR-ABL gene amplification [10]. In addition, a
number of newly discovered inhibitors with different drug
profile are under development now [11]. Given the fact that
more and more drug-treatment-induced point mutations
associated resistance emerged from the clinic and different
drugs bear different efficacy and toxicity profiles, diverse
pharmacophore-based new inhibitors are needed to provide
more options for fighting the CML. Here we report a novel
type II BCR-ABL kinase /PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor,
CHMFL-074, which exhibits high selectivity among the
kinome and high potencies against both the native and
a variety of clinically important mutants of BCR-ABL
kinases both in vitro and in vivo.

CHMFL-074 adopts a distinct binding mode
against BCR-ABL kinase

RESULTS

In order to understand the binding mechanism
of CHMFL-074 against ABL1 kinase, we then tried
to crystalize CHMFL-074 with ABL1 kinase and
fortunately we obtained a high resolution (1.53 Å) crystal
structure (PDB ID: 5HU9 and Supplementary Table 3)
(Figure 2A). The results demonstrated that CHMFL-074
adopted a typical type II binding mode (DFG-out
conformation) to ABL1, which was represented by two
canonical hydrogen bonds formed between the Glu286
located in the c-Helix and Asp381 located in the DFG
motif with the amide bond (NHC=O) in the drug. This is
similar with Imatinib which also binds to ABL1 kinase
with type II binding mode (PDB ID: 2HYY) (Figure 2B).
However, superimposition of CHMFL-074 with Imatinib
revealed a distinct hinge binding. CHMFL-074 used
oxygen atom of carbonyl group connecting the terminal
pyridine and piperidine ring to form the hinge binding
hydrogen bonds with Met318, while Imatinib used

CHMFL-074 is a highly potent and selective
BCR-ABL/PDGFR inhibitor
Aiming to develop a highly selective BCR-ABL
inhibitor, starting from the Imatinib core pharmacophore,
we performed a focused medicinal library design and
screening which led to the discovery of CHMFL-074
(Chemical Structure shown in Figure 1A). Examination
of CHMFL-074’s selectivity profile in the DiscoveRx’s
KinomeScanTM platform at 1 μM concentration revealed
a highly selective score (S-score (1) = 0.03) (Figure
1B and Supplementary Table 1). Besides native ABL1
kinase and a variety of clinically emerged mutants ABL1
mutants, such as ABL1 E255K, H396P, M351T, Q252H
and Y253F, it also has strong binding affinity (% control
number less than 1) against BLK, CSF1R, DDR1/2,
LCK, LOK, PDGFRβ, and RET kinases (Supplementary

the terminal pyridine ring’s N atom to form this hinge
binding (Figure 2C). In addition, Imatinib formed an
extra hydrogen bond between the aminopyrimidine’s
NH in the drug with the gatekeeper residue Thr315.
However, CHMFL-074 used O-linked piperidine ring
to replace this aminopyrimidine ring and abolished this
hydrogen bond. Docking results of CHMFL-074 with a
homology model of PDGFRβ kinase (built upon PDB
ID: 1T46) revealed a similar binding mode with ABL1
kinase (Figure 2D). It is noteworthy that most of the
type II inhibitors used the nitrogen atoms in the aromatic

heterocyclic to form the hinge binding, and oxygen
atom in the carbonyl group to serve as the hinge binding
hydrogen donor is relatively rare.

CHMFL-074 exhibits selective and potent antiproliferative effect against BCR-ABL dependent
CML cell lines and patient primary cells
We next tested CHMFL-074 in a panel of leukemia
cell lines. Not surprisingly, it exhibited strong antiproliferative effect against BCR-ABL dependent CML

cell lines such as K562 (GI50: 0.056 μM), KU812 (GI50:
0.057 μM) and MEG-01 (GI50: 0.018 μM) (Table 2).
In general, CHMFL-074 was 3–5 fold more potent
than Imatinib against these cells. As expected, both
CHMFL-074 and Imatinib did not display apparent antiproliferative effect against other leukemia cell lines such
as AML cells U937 and HL-60, MCL cell line REC-1
and CLL cell line MEC-1. CHMFL-074 also did not
inhibit the growth of the normal Chinese hamster ovary
cells indicating a non-general cytotoxicity. In addition,
CHMFL-074 potently blocked the colony formation
of BCR-ABL dependent cell lines K562 (EC50: 4 nM),
KU812 (EC50: 8 nM) and MEG-01 (EC50: 12 nM) (Figure
3A). In the BCR-ABL positive CML patient primary
cells, CHMFL-074 exhibited half effective inhibitory
concentrations between 0.3–1 μM which followed
similar trend as Imatinib (Figure 3B). Meanwhile, this
drug did not show any inhibitory activities against
normal human B-cells purified from the peripheral blood
at 1 μM (Figure 3C).

acceptable PK (T1/2 3.38 h, Bioavailability 42.93%) for the
oral administration (Table 3). In K562 inoculated mouse
model, oral administration of CHMFL-074 exhibited
dose-dependent tumor progression suppression efficacy
and 100 mg/kg/day dosage could almost block the tumor
growth with a TGI (tumor inhibition rate) of 65% while
no apparent toxicity was observed (Figure 5A–5C). As
expected, reduced phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and related
downstream mediators such as STAT5, ERK, CRKL in
tumors was observed compared to that in vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 5D). Immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining showed that CHMFL-074 dose dependently
inhibited the cell proliferation (Ki67 stain) and induced
apoptosis (TUNEL stain) (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION
Imatinib, the first launched target therapy, which
potently inhibits BCR-ABL, c-KIT and PDGFRs has
achieved remarkable success in the clinic [5]. However,
after chronic drug treatment, most patient relapse due to
the several different resistance mechanisms. One of the
most prevalent resistance mechanisms is due to the over
30 different point mutations, including G250E, Y253H,
E255K, F317L, M361T and the critical gatekeeper T315I
mutation, which decreased the inhibitory activity of
Imatinib [6]. The other important resistance mechanism
is due to the amplification of the BCR-ABL gene [10]. A
number of new drugs have been developed which either/
both increased the activity against native BCR-ABL
kinase or/and the variety of the mutants. The different
pharmacophore-based drugs displayed different efficacy
profiles against these number of mutants and there is still
an unmet clinical need to develop new pharmacophorebased drugs which bear different efficacy profiles and
serve as supplementary to the current anti-CML armory
library.
CHMFL-074 displays better inhibitory activity
than Imatinib against native BCR-ABL kinase and a
number of mutations such as E255K, F317L, F317I,
M351T, Q252H,Y253F and H369P. However, it did
not inhibit the critical gatekeeper mutant T315I. The
relatively rare binding mode of CHMFL-074, which uses
carbonyl oxygen as the hinge binding, also highlights
the new features of this type II compound. In summary,
the data presented here showed that CHMFL-074 was
highly effective against both the intact CML cell lines
and BCR-ABL positive patient primary hematopoietic
cells. It exhibited certain advantages over Imatinib
regarding the stronger potencies and capability to
inhibit some of the Imatinib resistant mutations. The
acceptable PK profile and in vivo efficacy again provided
additional rationale to further develop this compound as
a supplementary to the current anti-BCR-ABL positive
CML therapy.

CHMFL-074 blocks BCR-ABL mediated
signaling pathways and arrests cell cycle
We then examined CHMFL-074’s effect in
the BCR-ABL mediated signaling pathways. In the
engineered p210 native and mutants isogenic BaF3
cells, it potently inhibited phosphorylation of Y245 site
in BCR-ABL fusion protein in the wide type, E255K,
F317I, F317L, M351T, Q252H, Y253F, and F369P, but
did not affect T315I mutants, which is in accordant with
the anti-proliferative results (Figure 4A). The results
demonstrated that it potently inhibited the BCR-ABL’s
auto-phosphorylation at Y245 site in the K562 cells
(EC50: < 100 nM) and displayed better inhibitory activities
than Imatinib (Figure 4B left panel). CHMFL-074 also
significantly blocked downstream signaling mediators
such as pStat5, pCrkL and pERK in K562 cells, following
the trend of better inhibition than Imatinib. Similar results
were observed in the other two BCR-ABL dependent
CML cell lines KU812 and MEG-01, confirming that
this drug has strong inhibitory effect in the BCR-ABL
mediated signaling pathways (Figure 4B middle and right
panel). In addition, starting from 0.3 μM concentration,
CHMFL-074 could effectively induce G0/G1 phase cell
cycle arrest and displayed a similar effect with Imatinib
at 3 μM in K562, KU812 and MEG-01 cells (Figure 4C).
Apparent dose-dependent apoptosis was observed by
examination of the cleavage PARP and Caspase-3 of these
cell lines (Figure 4D).

from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA).

Inhibitors
CHMFL-074 was synthesized in the lab (procedure
following patent: CN201410757626.7) and dissolved in
DMSO at a stock concentration of 10 mM and stored in
aliquots at −20°C. Imatinib was purchased from Shanghai
Haoyuan Chemexpress Inc. (Shanghai, China).

ABL1 and c-KIT protein purification
A construct encoding c-ABL residues 229–500 with
a His tag was cloned into baculovirus expression vector
pFASTHTA. The protein was expressed by infecting SF9
cells with high titer viral stocks for 48 hours. Cells were
harvested and lysed in 30 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
3 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM TCEP,
1 mM ADP, 20 mM Imidazole. The supernatant was
loaded to Ni-NTA Column (QIAGEN, 1018244). Then
the proteins were gradient washed using the same buffer
with 50 mM, 100 mM imidazole, then the ABL protein
was eluted with Elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM
NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM ADP, 300 mM
Imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluted protein was loaded on
desalt column PD-10(GE) to change the buffer to 20 mM
Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, pH 8.0.
The protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and aliquots
were frozen and stored at −80°C.

REC-1 (Human B-cell lymphoma cell), HL-60 (Human
promyelocytic leukemia cells), MEC-1(CLL), CHL
(Hamster lung cell), CHO (Hamster ovary cell) cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). All the cells were grown in a humidified
incubator (Thermo, USA) at 37°C under 5% CO2. CHO
cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, 1% penicillin/strepto-mycin. MV4-11 (AML)

penicillin/streptomycin. All the other cell lines and all the
isogenic BaF3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
supported with 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Adherent cells were grown in tissue culture flasks until
they were 85–95% confluent prior to use. For suspension
cells, cells were collected by spinning down at 800 rpm/
min for 5 min before use.

Kinase biochemical assay
The fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based
Z′-LYTE kinase assay (Invitrogen, USA) was used to
evaluate the IC50 value of CHMFL-074 for inhibition of
ABL and KIT kinase. The reaction was performed on
a 384-well plate with a 10 μL reaction volume per well
containing 2 μM peptide (Tyr 02 peptide for ABL kinase,
Tyr 06 peptide for KIT kinase) substrate in reaction buffer,
and ABL kinase (2.5 μL, 5 ng) or KIT kinase (2.5 μL,
10 ng) with a serial 3-fold dilution of CHMFL-074 (2.5 μL,
10 μM to 1.5 nM). The final reaction concentration of ATP
was 300 μM. After 1 hour incubation, the reaction was
developed and terminated, and the fluorescence measured
with an automated plate reader (SpectraMax I3, USA). A
dose-response curve was fitted using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
The ADP-Glo™ kinase assay (Promega, USA) was
used to screen CHMFL-074 for its PDGFRα/PDGFRβ
inhibition effects. The kinase reaction system contains
PDGFRα (9 μL, 90 ng), PDGFRβ (9 μL, 90 ng), 1 μL
of serially diluted CHMFL-074, and 10 μL substrate Poly
(4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide (0.4 μg/μL) (Promega, USA) with
100 μM ATP (Promega, USA). The reaction in each tube
was started immediately by adding ATP and kept going for
an hour under 37°C. After the tube cooled for 5 minutes
at room temperature, 5 μL solvent reactions were carried
out in a 384-well plate. Then 5 μL of ADP-Glo™ reagent
was added into each well to stop the reaction and consume
the remaining ADP within 40 minutes. At the end, 10 μL
of kinase detection reagent was added to the wells and

Immunoblotting
K562, KU812, MEG-01cells were treated with
DMSO, serially diluted compound CHMFL-074, 1 μM
Imatinib for 2 h before immunoblotting. Cells were
washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
lysed using radio-immunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer
[150 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol)
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS] in 50 mM Tris
HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Thermo, USA). Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime,
China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an
Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA), and
blocked in 5% dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline, with
Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated with
primary and secondary antibodies, and target proteins
were detected with ECL detection reagent (Pierce, USA).
β-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich) served as a loading control.

incubated for 30 minutes to produce luminescence signal.
Luminescence signal was measured with an automated
plate reader (Envision, USA) and the dose-response curve
was fitted using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA).

Diffraction data of the ABL1/CHMFL-074 crystal
were collected at 100 K on beamline BL17U1 at Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The diffraction
data were processed using HKL-3000. The structure was
solved by molecular replacement with Phaser using the
previously reported ABL1 structure (PDB ID 2HYY) as the
search model. CNS was then used to obtain a less biased
model (by simulated-annealing) and calculate the sigmaA
weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps for manual inspection
and adjustment. Repeated rounds of manual refitting and
crystallographic refinement were then performed using
COOT and Phenix. The inhibitor was modeled into the
closely fitting positive Fo-Fc electron density and included
in following refinement cycles. Topology and parameter
files for the inhibitor were generated using PRODRG.
The crystal diffraction data and refinement statistics were
summarized in Supplementary Table 3. The refined ABL1/
CHMFL-074 crystal structure was deposited in Protein
Data Bank with the entry ID 5HU9.

Microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding Kd
assay
The Kd was measured using the Monolith
NT.115 from Nanotemper Technologies. Proteins were
fluorescently labeled according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. A range of concentrations of ligands
CHMFL-074 and Imatinib (range from 0.05 mM to 2.5
nM) were incubated with 200 nM of purified Abl protein
5 min in assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0,
and 0.05% Tween 20). The sample was loaded into the
NanoTemper glass capillaries and microthermophoresis
carried out using 20% LED power and 30% MST Power.
KD were calculated using the mass action equation via the
NanoTemper software from duplicate reads of triplicate
experiments.

Molecular modeling of PDGFRβ kinase

Protein preparation and crystallization

Currently there are no crystal structure for the kinase
domain of PDGFRα/β in the PDB, homology models
were built using MODELLER 9.15 [12] for docking and
comparison. The cKIT kinase domain (PDB ID: 1T46)
was used as the template, the sequence alignment was
shown in Supplementary Figure 1, the lowest-energy
models generated by default settings were further refined
using AmberTools [13]. CHMFL-074 was constructed
using BioX 4.6 [14] and manually docked into the ATP
binding pocket of PDGFRα/β using YetiX 8.3 [15], the side
chain flexibility [16] and directional hydrogen bonds [17]
are considered during docking.

Construct of ABL1 kinase domain spanning residues
229–500 was PCR-cloned from human cDNA library and
inserted into pFastBac-HTB plasmid between the Bam HI
and Xho I restriction sites. The N-terminal 6xHis-tagged
ABL1 protein (a TEV protease cleavage site was inserted
between the tag and ABL1 for later removal of the tag) was
expressed in Sf9 insect cells. After harvesting, the cells
were broken by sonication in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris,
150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF,
1 mM TCEP, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4). Cell lysate was
obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4
°C and then applied to the Chelating Sepharose Beads
(GE Healthcare, Cat. 17-0575-02) charged with Ni2+. The
beads were thoroughly washed with wash buffer (20 mM
Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, 30 mM
Imidazole, pH 8.0), and then the protein was eluted with
elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol,
1 mM TCEP, 300 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluent was
concentrated and cleaved by TEV enzyme to remove the
His-tag, and then applied to gel-filtration chromatography
using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, Cat. 175175-01) to further purify the ABL1 protein. The purified
protein was concentrated and dispensed into aliquots,
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°C freezer
for later using.
For co-crystallization, 100 mM CHMFL-074
solution was added to 16 mg/mL ABL1 protein solution
to achieve the final concentration of 1 mM compound.
The mixture was incubated on ice for 0.5 hours and then
applied to crystallization using the hanging drop vapor
diffusion method. The crystallization reservoir solution
was 0.1 M Potassium thiocyanate, 28% PEG2000MME.

BaF3 isogenic cell line generation
Retroviral constructs for fusion kinases were made
based on the pMSCVpuro (Clontech) backbone. For TEL
fusion vectors, the first 1 kb of human TEL gene with an
artificial myristoylation sequence (MGCGCSSHPEDD)
was cloned into pMSCVpuro retroviral vector, followed
by a 3xFLAG tag sequence and a stop codon; for
BCR fusion vectors, the first 2.8 kb coding region of
p210 amplified from K562 cell line was used in fusion
constructs. Then the kinase domain coding sequences
were inserted in-frame between TEL/BCR and 3xFLAG
sequences. All mutagenesis were performed using the
QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Retrovirus was
packaged in HEK293T cells by transfecting kinase-fusion
MSCV vectors together with two helper plasmids, virus
supernatants were harvested 48 hours after transfection and
filtered before infection. Then BaF3 cells were infected
with harvested virus supernatants using spinoculation

Colony formation assay

Anti-Proliferation studies

In brief, 1 mL of 3% agarose combined with 1 mL
KU812, MEG01, or K562 growth media was used as
the bottom agar in a 6-well plate. 800 cells in 1.7 mL
growth media was combined with 0.3 ml of 3% agarose
solution and plated on top of the bottom layer. Cells were
maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for
15 days, and continuously treated with serially diluted
CHMFL-074 in a soft agar medium. On the 15th day, the
number of colonies in each well were counted and each
measurement was performed in triplicate.

A density of 1 × 104 to 2.5 × 104 cells/mL cells
were mixed with various concentrations of compounds
then 100 μL suspension was added to each well and
incubated for 72 hours. Cell viability was determined
using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, USA) or CCK8 assay (Beboy, China). Both assays were performed
according to the manufacturer instructions. For CellTiterGlo assay, luminescence was determined in a multi-label
reader (Envision, PerkinElmer, USA). For CCK-8 assay,
absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (iMARK,
Bio-Rad, USA) at 450 nm and 655 nm. Data were
normalized to control group (DMSO). GI50 were calculated
using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

In vivo pharmacokinetics study
CHMFL-074 was dissolved in 55% saline
containing 5% DMSO and 40% PEG400 by vortex. The
final concentration of the stock solution was 1 mg/mL for
administration. Six-eight weeks old male Sprague-Dawely
rats were fasted overnight before starting drug treatment via
intravenous (1 mg/kg) and oral administration (10 mg/kg).
Animal blood collection time points were as follows: for
group 1, 3, 5 (intravenous): 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min,
1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h before and after administration was
selected; for group 2, 4, 6 (oral): 5 min, 15 min, 30 min,
1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h before and after dosing.
Each time about 0.2 mL blood was collected through the
jugular vein adding heparin for anticoagulation and kept
on ice. Then plasma was separated by centrifugation at
8000 rpm for 6 minutes at 2–8°C. The obtained plasma
was stored at −80°C before analysis. After finishing
the test, all surviving animals will be transferred to the
repository or euthanasia (CO2 asphyxiation).

Patient primary cell proliferation assay
Mononuclear cells were isolated from CML patients
or healthy donors by density-gradient centrifugation
through Ficoll (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at 400 g for 30 min, followed
by two washes in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were
then cultured in liquid culture (RPMI1640, supplemented
with 20% FBS). All blood samples from CML patients
and healthy donors were obtained through written consent
under approval of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
Institutional Review Board. The ethics committees
approved the consent Procedure. CML primary patient cells
were tested in liquid culture (RPMI1640, supplemented
with 20% FBS) in the presence of different concentrations
of CHMFL-074. The trypan blue exclusion assay was used
for quantification of cells for seeding for before Cell-Titer
Glo assays (Promega, USA). The Cell-Titer Glo assay was
used for proliferation studies and carried out according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cell viability is reported as
percentages of control (untreated) cells.

K562 xenograft tumor model
Five-week old female nu/nu mice were purchased
from the Shanghai Experimental Center, Chinese Science
Academy (Shanghai, China). All animals were housed
in a specific pathogen-free facility and used according
to the animal care regulations of Hefei Institutes of
Physical Science Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior
to implantation, cells were harvested during exponential
growth. Five million K562 cells in PBS were formulated
as a 1:1 mixture with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
injected into the subcutaneous space on the right flank
of nu/nu mice. Daily oral administration was initiated
when K562 tumors had reached a size of 200 to 300 mm3.
Animals were then randomized into treatment groups of 6
mice each for efficacy studies. CHMFL-074 was delivered
daily in a HKI solution (0.5% Methocellulose/0.4%
Tween 80 in dd H2O) by orally gavage. A range of doses

Cell cycle analysis
K562, KU812 and MEG01 cells were treated with
serially diluted CHMFL-074 for 12 or 24 hours. The cells
were fixed in 70% cold ethanol and incubated at −20°C
overnight, then stained with PI/RNase staining buffer (BD
Pharmingen). Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS
Calibur (BD), and results were analyzed by ModFit software.
