ABSTRACT
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have improved CML response rates, and some
are effective against resistance-promoting point mutations in BCR-ABL1. However,
in the absence of point mutations, resistance still occurs. Here, we identify a novel
pathway mediating resistance which connects p47phox, the organizer subunit of
NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2), with early growth response-1 (Egr-1) and the Src family
kinase Fyn. We found up-regulation of p47phox, Egr-1, and Fyn mRNA and protein
using paired isogenic CML cell lines and mined data. Isolation of CD34+ cells and
tissue microarray staining from blast crisis CML patients confirmed in vivo overexpression of components of this pathway. Knockdown studies revealed that p47phox
modulated reactive oxygen species and Egr-1 expression, which, in turn, controlled
Fyn expression. Interestingly, Fyn knockdown sensitized TKI-resistant cells to
dasatinib, a dual BCR-ABL1/Src inhibitor. Egr-1 knockdown had similar effects,
indicating the utility of targeting Fyn expression over activation. Pointedly, p47phox
knockdown also restored TKI-sensitivity, indicating that targeting the NOX2 complex
can overcome resistance. The NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway was also conserved within
TKI-resistant EGFRΔIII-expressing glioblastoma and patient-derived glioblastoma
stem cells. Thus, our findings suggest that targeting the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway
may have clinical implications within multiple cancer types; particularly where efficacy
of TKI is compromised.

INTRODUCTION

options for mutation-independent resistance remain
limited. Mutation-independent resistance is characterized
by amplification of downstream BCR-ABL1 signaling
or parallel activation of signal transduction proteins
including Src family kinases such as Fyn [7]. In addition,
persistence of CML stem cells (LSC), which are less
dependent on BCR-ABL1 rendering them less sensitive to
TKI, are another example of point mutation-independent
resistance [8]. As stem cell populations are commonly less
sensitive to inhibition of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, the
identification of novel targetable pathways within those
populations is of vital importance.
TKI-resistance is not a phenomenon that is exclusive
to CML. For example, in glioblastoma multiforme

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
directed against BCR-ABL1, the primary oncogene
associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), has
dramatically increased patient survival rates [1, 2].
However, TKI-resistance is a looming clinical problem
as the number of patients with detectable disease burden
continues to grow [2]. This issue underscores a need for
new approaches to treat refractory patients. Single point
mutations in BCR-ABL1 are known determinants of
TKI-sensitivity [3-6]. However, such mutation-dependent
resistance is currently treatable by second and third
generation TKI such as nilotinib and ponatinib. Treatment

(GBM) TKIs have been tested that target the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) [9]. GBMs comprise
the most aggressive and common form of primary brain
tumor, conferring the worst clinical prognosis [10].
Patients with GBM survive little more than one year past
diagnosis. EGFR amplification and activating mutations,
EGFRΔIII and R108K, are commonly detected genetic
alterations in GBM [11-13]. The most common EGFR
mutation, EGFRΔIII, arises from an in-frame omission
of 801 bp encoding the extracellular domain, rendering
a truncated, yet constitutively active, form of the receptor
[14, 15]. Such alterations of EGFR have been identified
as strong indicators of worse patient survival in GBM
[16]. Enrichment of EGFRΔIII expression is seen in a
population of highly resistant GBM-derived stem cells
(GSCs) [17-22]. Therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR
with small molecule targeted-TKI, such as lapatinib, have
yielded limited clinical efficacy, particularly in the setting
of EGFRΔIII mutation [11, 23]. Therefore, strategies
designed to therapeutically target TKI- resistance
mechanisms may provide hope in a myriad of cancer
types.
Prior work has identified that the elevated
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs in
multiple cancer types. Particularly, expression of BCRABL1, as well as other oncogenes, is known to result
in increased levels of ROS within cancer cells [24-26].
The primary source of ROS in the majority of cells is the
mitochondria [27]. As such, the mitochondrial influence
on ROS in cancer has been extensively studied [28-30].
We have, however, discovered that alternative sources
of ROS, such as the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex,
contribute to the resistant phenotype, through activation
of a novel pathway in TKI-resistant CML and GBM.
Collectively, our data in two cell line models of mutationindependent TKI-resistance, as well as patient samples,
demonstrate a novel pathway connecting NOX2 to the
transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and
subsequently Fyn, highlighting new mediators of TKIresistance with potential to eradicate cancer stem cells.

were significantly elevated in K562R and KBM7R cell
lines as compared to their parental counterparts (Figure
1B). In order to more specifically pinpoint the source of
ROS, we first analyzed the primary source of ROS in
most cells: the mitochondria [27]. We measured oxygen
consumption rates and mitochondrial respiration in both
K562 and K562R cells. Mitochondrial respiration was
similar between K562 and K562R cells (Figure 1C).
Both cell lines did, however, display a basal level of
non-mitochondrial respiration as evidenced by oxygen
consumption in the presence of the mitochondrial
complex I and III inhibitors, rotenone and antimycin A,
suggesting potential alternative ROS sources. Thus, we
utilized a variety of chemical ROS inhibitors to delineate
a ROS source. While rotenone and antimycin A had no
effect on ROS production of K562R cells (Figure 1D),
diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced ROS by 40% (p
< 0.01). One of the potential targets of DPI is the NOX
family of enzyme complexes. This enzyme family
metabolizes NADPH to NADP+ converting oxygen to
superoxide [27]. Interestingly, NOX activity was elevated
1.8-fold in K562R cells as compared to parental K562
cells (Figure 1E). DPI was sufficient to restore activity
to baseline levels. Together, these data suggest that the
primary source of elevated ROS levels in resistant CML is
the NOX complex.
Recently, the NOX family has been described as
a potential therapeutic target in CML [33-36]; however
its contribution to the resistance phenotype remains
unknown. CML cells have been noted to be particularly
dependent on the NOX2 isoform which consists of NOX2,
p67phox, p40phox, Rac1, and the key organizer subunit
p47phox [27]. Knockdown of p47phox with siRNA
resulted in a 50% reduction in NOX activity (Figure
1F) and an approximately 25% decrease in overall ROS
levels of K562R cells (Figure 1G). Interestingly, mRNA
expression of p47phox (NCF1), p67phox (NCF2), and
gp91phox (NOX2) are up-regulated in samples from
patients with resistance to imatinib as compared to blast
crisis (BC) CML patients (Figure 1H). The same holds
true in our isogenic model systems, where K562R and
KBM7R cell lines have elevated mRNA and protein
levels of p47phox compared to their parental counterparts
(Figure 1I and 1J). Together, these data suggest that the
NOX2 complex is expressed in, and controlling the redox
milieu of, mutation-independent TKI-resistant CML.

RESULTS
Non-mitochondrial ROS production controls
proliferation of TKI-resistant CML

Fyn kinase is downstream of NOX2 in TKIresistant CML

To understand how alterations of the redox milieu
are associated with TKI-resistance in CML, we first
measured the levels of ROS within two cell line models
of acquired mutation-independent resistance. The TKIsensitive/mutation-independent TKI-resistant pairs of
CML cell lines (K562/K562R and KBM7/KBM7R; [31,
32]) were stained with dichlorofluorescein (DCF) to
measure basal ROS expression (Figure 1A and 1B). ROS

Our lab has previously established that the Src
family kinase Fyn is controlled by the elevated ROS
levels in CML [37], and overexpression of Fyn has been
suggested as a mediator of imatinib resistance in CML
[38-40]. However, the source of ROS and pathway leading

be a downstream effector of NOX2-induced ROS, we
analyzed Fyn expression after knockdown of p47phox
(Figure 2A). Fyn was decreased when p47phox was
knocked down, suggesting that Fyn is downstream of the

NOX2 complex in mutation-independent TKI-resistant
CML. To further associate Fyn with TKI-resistance in this
setting, we probed for Fyn expression and activity in our
cell line systems. Fyn was overexpressed in both TKIresistant cell lines (K562R and KBM7R) as compared

to their parental counterparts (Figure 2B). Additionally,
Fyn activity, as measured by phosphorylation of Fyn, was
elevated in K562R as compared to K562 cells (Figure
2C). These data are congruent with data from fifteen
TKI-resistant patient samples where Fyn mRNA was upregulated approximately 1.7-fold (Figure 2D) compared to
BC samples [41]. Additionally, RNA-interference-based
knockdown of Fyn decreased growth of K562R cells by
36% (Figure 2E) suggesting a functional role of Fyn in
these TKI-resistant cells. Together, these data suggest that
Fyn may be a downstream mediator of NOX2 effects in
CML.

holds true in the resistance setting. Our previous work
has shown that Fyn expression is high in a panel of BC
patients relative to those in chronic or accelerated phase
[42], therefore, we examined Egr-1 protein expression in
a tissue microarray (TMA) containing samples from CML
patients in chronic phase (CP; n = 10), accelerated phase
(AP; n = 6), and BC (n = 10) (Figure 3B). CP samples
were exclusively negative for Egr-1 protein staining.
However as CML progressed to AP and then to BC, 50%
and 60% of patient samples were positive, respectively.
Western blotting confirmed a four-fold overexpression of
Egr-1 protein in BC samples compared to CP (data not
shown). K562R and KMB7R cells were also analyzed
for expression of Egr-1 (Figure 3C) which was increased
in both cell lines compared with parental controls. Much
like genetic inhibition of Fyn, knockdown of Egr-1 using
siRNA decreased proliferation of viable K562R cells
by 56% at 24 hours (Figure 3D). To determine if Egr-1
was indeed downstream of p47phox in K562R cells, we
performed knockdown of p47phox using siRNA. When
p47phox was depleted, Egr-1 was clearly decreased
at both the protein (Figure 3E) and mRNA (Figure 3F)
levels. Together these data suggest that a pathway exists in
mutation-independent TKI-resistant CML whereby NOX2
induces Egr-1 expression leading to Fyn expression.

Egr-1 is downstream of NOX2 and regulates Fyn
expression in TKI-resistant CML
To further delineate a pathway between NOX2
and Fyn in TKI-resistant CML, we focused on Egr-1.
We have previously shown that Egr-1 is a transcription
factor driving ROS-dependent Fyn expression in TKIsensitive CML cells [37] however, little is known about
differential Egr-1 expression in phases of CML, or its
role in TKI-resistant disease. Knockdown of Egr-1 was
sufficient to decrease Fyn protein levels in K562R cells
(Figure 3A), suggesting that regulation of Fyn by Egr-1

resistant CML cells to TKI

therapeutic agents to target Egr-1. Egr-1 is well known as
a redox sensitive transcription factor, and is decreased by
treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC,
data not shown). We therefore determined if modulating
the redox environment with NAC could also promote
sensitivity. Indeed, NAC treatment was sufficient to reduce
resistance to both imatinib (26%) and dasatinib (30%)
in K562R cells (Figure 4C, p < 0.05). To determine if
specifically targeting the NOX2 complex may be a viable
option for TKI-resistant CML we used two methods. First,
we performed knockdown of p47phox which significantly
increased sensitivity to imatinib and dasatinib in both
K562R and KBM7R cell lines (Figure 4D, p < 0.05). To
confirm these results, we also treated K562R cells with
NSC23766, an inhibitor of Rac1/2, another component
of the NOX2 complex. Co-treatment of K562R cells with
NSC23766 and TKIs resulted in significant induction of
DNA-fragmentation compared to either treatment alone
(Figure 4E, p < 0.05). Together, these results suggest that
targeting the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway is a viable option
for overcoming mutation-independent TKI-resistance in
CML.

Thus far, we have shown that a pathway exists
with the potential to alter proliferation of TKI-resistant
CML. To determine the therapeutic relevance of targeting
the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway in TKI-resistant CML,
we first explored Fyn inhibition. Fyn kinase activity is
effectively blocked by the second generation dual BCRABL1/SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib. However, K562R
cells are resistant to dasatinib, despite their high level of
Fyn protein expression and activity (Figure 2B and 2C).
RNAi-mediated knockdown of Fyn protein, however,
was sufficient to significantly sensitize K562R cells
to dasatinib by 56% (Figure 4A, p < 0.05). These data
suggest that targeting Fyn kinase activity is inadequate
for eliminating TKI-resistant CML and that targeting
Fyn transcript is a potentially more effective method.
Thus, we went up-stream in the pathway. Targeting Egr1 with siRNA resulted in increased sensitivity of K562R
cells to both imatinib (56%) and dasatinib (34%, Figure
4B, p < 0.05). However, there are no currently available

The NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway is active in EGFRexpressing GBM

CML, the NOX family of enzymes has been described as a
potential therapeutic target in GBM [43-45]. Of the seven
family members, NOX4 has been noted as a prevalent
isoform in GBM [43-45]. However, our data suggest
that NOX2 may be the predominant isoform in EGFRexpressing GBM. We therefore performed qRTPCR for
NOX4 and p47phox in our model system (Figure 5C).
While p47phox mRNA was significantly up-regulated
(1.3-fold in wtEGFR, 1.75-fold in EGFRΔIII, and 1.72fold in R108K) by the presence of active EGFR (p < 0.01),
there was no increase in NOX4. Much like in the CML
setting, the more TKI-resistant EGFR-overexpressing
cells had elevated levels of ROS (Figure 5D). To confirm
the influence of NOX2 in GBM with active EGFR, we
performed chemical inhibition of the NOX complex. The
inhibitors DPI and apocynin were sufficient to decrease
ROS levels of EGFRΔIII and R108K cell lines by 45%
and 55% in EGFRΔIII and 36% and 50% in R108K,
respectively, whereas rotenone did not significantly alter
ROS in these settings (Figure 5E, p < 0.05). NOX activity
was also up-regulated 2.8-fold in EGFRΔIII cells (Figure
5F, p < 0.05). Both heightened NOX activity (53%) and
ROS (29%) levels were significantly quenched by siRNA-

As mentioned previously, TKI-resistance is not a
phenomenon that is exclusive to CML. Thus, to determine
if the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway was active in another
kinase-driven cancer type, we first mined data from two
independent data sets. Both Sun and colleagues (Figure
5A) and the TCGA database (data not shown) show
statistically significant increases in expression of p47phox
(2.58-fold, p < 0.001), Egr-1 (1.43-fold, p < 0.01), and
Fyn (1.8-fold, p < 0.001) mRNA, particularly in GBM
where EGFR is also amplified. These data suggest that
this pathway may also be active in EGFR-expressing
GBM. To model this cancer type, we used the U87
glioblastoma cell line expressing either vector, wild-type
EGFR (wtEGFR), EGFRΔIII, or EGFR with the R108K
mutation (R108K). These cell lines were first probed
for expression of p47phox, Egr-1, and Fyn by western
blotting (Figure 5B). When EGFR was overexpressed and
highly active, protein levels of all three components of
this pathway were significantly increased. Much like in

mediated knockdown of p47phox (Figure 5G and 5H, p
< 0.05). Knockdown also revealed that the NOX2/Egr-1/
Fyn pathway was intact in EGFRΔIII cells (Figure 5I).
Together, these data suggest that the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn
pathway is present in multiple cancer types where it may
promote a TKI-resistance phenotype.

as compared to CD34- cells (Figure 6A). To determine if
the downstream effectors of this pathway were present
in LSC containing populations, we performed western
blotting for Egr-1 and Fyn. The expression of Egr-1 was
up-regulated 5.4-fold and Fyn was elevated 3.9-fold in
CD34+ cells compared to their CD34- counterparts (Figure
6B). Additionally, microarray data from BC-LSCs, which
are potentially more treatment resistant than CP-LSCs,
showed up-regulation of Fyn mRNA (Figure 6C). As
shown in figure 5, the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway is a
common signature of resistance within a subset of GBM.
Thus, to determine if this pathway was also relevant in
GSCs, ROS was measured in a panel of patient-derived
GSCs. Much like LSCs, ROS levels were elevated in
GSCs as compared to normal progenitor cells (Figure
6D). Fyn expression, as evaluated by western blotting,
was increased in eight of ten GSC cell lines (Figure 6E).
Knockdown of Fyn, specifically in the GSC7-2 line,
resulted in a 75% attenuation of sphere forming capacity
(Figure 6F). Together, these data suggest that the NOX2/
Egr-1/Fyn pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for
the eradication of the more treatment resistant cancer stem
cell populations.

Effectors of the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway are
potential targets in cancer stem cells
TKI-resistance has been attributed to the persistence
of cancer stem cells [8]. These stem cell populations
more closely recapitulate properties observed within
human primary disease and tend to be the most highly
resistant to TKI [8] because they are less dependent on
BCR-ABL1 [46]. We therefore sought to determine if
LSCs derived from CML patients had altered levels
of ROS. BC-CML is associated with increased CD34+
cells [47]. We isolated CD34+ cells containing LSCs
from a CML patient in BC and determined ROS levels
compared to CD34- cells. Indeed, ROS were elevated in
CD34+ cells containing LSCs isolated from BC patients

in proliferation and survival of resistant cells (Figure 7B).
This novel pathway can be inhibited by specific targeting
of the NOX complex, ROS scavenging, or direct inhibition
of Egr-1 and its downstream effectors. Thus, our data
delineate new options for the therapeutic targeting of CML
in patients with mutation-independent TKI-resistance,
with the potential for similar effects in other TKI-resistant
cancer types.
The NOX family has been suggested as potential
therapeutic targets in prostate and pancreatic cancers, as
well as Burkitt’s lymphoma, melanomas, glioblastomas
and TKI-sensitive CML [33-36, 49-52]. Of the seven NOX
complex family members, NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, NOX5,
and DUOX2 have all been identified as isoforms present
in CML [27, 33, 35]. Specifically, Sanchez-Sanchez and
colleagues have shown expression of NOX2, NOX5, and
DUOX2 in K562 cells and CML patient samples. In this
setting, NOX2 was the most highly expressed isoform.
Additionally, they combined use of BCR-ABL1-directed
TKI and the flavo-enzyme inhibitor DPI which resulted

To determine potential mediators of NOX2-induced
Egr-1 expression and ultimately TKI-resistance, we
utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to uncover genes
that were coordinately regulated in TKI-resistant CML
[39] and BC-LSCs [48] (Figure 7A). Potential mediators
of the NOX2–Egr-1 pathway include PKCβ, PIN1, and
RelA. Additionally, multiple downstream mediators of
proliferation and survival were coordinately up-regulated
downstream of Egr-1 which include a myriad of proteins
in addition to Fyn (Figure 7A). Collectively, our data
highlight the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway as viable options
for overcoming mutation-independent acquired TKIresistance.

DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that a novel pathway is present in
TKI-resistant CML, and EGFRΔIII GBM, cells whereby

in synergistic cell death of TKI-sensitive K562 cells
in vitro. Further, this combination was effective in two
independent mouse models of TKI-sensitive CML, and
inhibited proliferation of CD34+ cells isolated from CML
patients [33]. However, this study failed to determine
the contribution of NOX to mutation-independent TKIresistant CML. Similarly, Landry and colleagues found
that targeting p22phox, a component of NOX1, NOX2,
and NOX4, promoted cell death of TKI-sensitive CML
cells [35]. However, much like the previous study, the
role of the NOX complex in TKI-resistance was not
established. We have found that p47phox, an organizer
subunit found within the assembled NOX2 complex, is
significantly up-regulated in two mutation-independent
TKI-resistant CML cell lines and a TKI-resistant patient
population (Figure 1H-1J). Specifically, data mined from
Radich and colleagues noted that, while the majority
of genes from chronic phase patients with relapse after
imatinib treatment looked similar to that of advanced
phase (BC) patients [41], other genes, such as the NOX2-

related genes shown here, were uniquely altered in
patients with TKI-resistance, suggesting potential roles
for these molecules in the resistance phenotype. However,
the mutational-dependence of the resistance was not well
described as the patient data was not stratified by mutation
status. We further show that the NOX2 complex controls
elevation of ROS in resistant cells, since targeting p47phox
with siRNA was sufficient to decrease both NOX activity
and ROS in K562R cells (Figure 1F and 1G). Utilizing
two methods to target the NOX2 complex (p47phox
knockdown and the Rac1/2 inhibitor NSC23766) we
found that inhibition of NOX2 was sufficient to increase
sensitivity to BCR-ABL-directed TKI (Figure 4E and 4F).
Thus, NOX2 may be a therapeutically relevant target in
both TKI-sensitive and -resistant CML.
We and others have identified the Src family
kinase Fyn as a potential redox-dependent mediator of
TKI-resistance in CML [38-40, 42]. Fyn is indeed upregulated in TKI-resistant CML cell lines (Figure 2B)
however inhibition of Fyn kinase activity is insufficient to

Figure 7: A number of pathways link NOX to Egr-1 and subsequent proliferation and survival. A. Ingenuity pathway

analysis was utilized to compare the potential linking pathways between NCF1 (p47phox) and Egr-1/Fyn. Potential linking targets are
those that show congruent regulation and interaction in TKI-resistant cell lines and LSCs from blast crisis patients over chronic phase LSCs
[39, 48]. B. Our working model predicts that resistant CML and GBM cells share a pathway through which an oncogene promotes ROS
generation through NOX2 leading to Egr-1 expression leading to proliferation and survival even in the presence of TKIs.

overcome pan-TKI-resistance (Figure 4A). Interestingly,
knockdown of Fyn re-sensitizes cells that are resistant
even to Fyn kinase inhibition by dasatinib (Figure 4A)
suggesting that targeting Fyn protein itself may be a
better therapeutic option. We have found that Fyn is
downstream of p47phox (Figure 2A), and Egr-1, the
transcription factor known to regulate redox-sensitive
Fyn expression [37], is an intermediary of this pathway
(Figure 3A, 3E and 3F). Consistent with our previous
studies in TKI-sensitive CML [37], knockdown of Egr1 resulted in decreased Fyn protein expression (Figure
3A), and much like Fyn [42], Egr-1 protein was increased
as patients progressed from CP to BC CML (Figure 3B).
Two cell line models of mutation-independent TKIresistance (K562R and KBM7R; Figure 3C) had elevated
Egr-1 protein expression. Egr-1 itself has varying roles in
cancer depending on the cellular context. In breast cancer,
fibrosarcoma, and MDS, Egr-1 has been described as a
tumor suppressor [53-56]. However, in ovarian cancer,
ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer, Egr-1 is
oncogenic [57-62]. Knockdown of Egr-1 in TKI-resistant
CML cell lines was sufficient to decrease proliferation
(Figure 3D) suggesting that Egr-1 plays an oncogenic role
in CML. Further, decreasing Egr-1 expression by siRNA
re-sensitized resistant cells to BCR-ABL1-directed TKI
(Figure 4B), suggesting that Egr-1 may be a novel target
for the control of mutation-independent TKI-resistance.
With their relative success in CML, TKIs which
target other oncogenic tyrosine kinases have been tested in
other cancers, such as lapatinib in EGFR-expressing GBM
[11-13]. However such strategies have yielded only limited
clinical efficacy [11, 23]. We found that components of
the novel NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway were also commonly
up-regulated in EGFR-expressing patient GBM patient
samples (Figure 5A) and cell line models (Figure 5B and
5C), where they remained dependent on p47phox (Figure
5I). Further, while NOX4 has been the primary NOX
isoform associated with GBM, we have found that GBM
with active EGFR over-expresses NOX2, which results
in elevated ROS levels (Figure 5C-5H). Together, these
data indicate that the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway is also
pertinent to other TKI-resistant cancer types.
Cancer stem cells are being increasingly recognized
as a significant contributor to relapsed and refractory
disease, and in CML, elegant studies indicate that the
LSC population is less reliant upon BCR-ABL1 for
survival and therefore less susceptible to direct inhibition
of the oncogenic kinase [8, 46]. We find that ROS levels
are heightened in LSCs from BC patients (Figure 6A),
which is consistent with reports of increased ROS and
increased oxidative phosphorylation in CML LSCs [63,
64]. Increased Egr-1 and Fyn are seen in this population
(Figure 6B and 6C) indicating that components of this
ROS dependent pathway are overexpressed in LSCs.
These data extend to other cancer stem cell models, since
ROS were similarly elevated in patient-derived GSC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines (Figure 6D), and the endpoint of this pathway,
Fyn, was also overexpressed (Figure 6E). Importantly,
knockdown of Fyn protein was sufficient to decrease
GSC sphere formation (Figure 6F). Together, these data
suggest that the NOX2/Egr-1/Fyn pathway may also have
potential for the eradication of cancer stem cells across
cancer types.
While the pathway through which the NOX2
complex elevates Egr-1 expression remains unknown,
ingenuity pathway analysis of TKI-resistant cell lines and
blast crisis LSCs reveal a number of different pathways
through which this might occur including NFκB, PIN1,
or PRKCB (Figure 7A). These pathways are the subject
of future experiments. Additionally, Egr-1 may have
a myriad of targets in addition to Fyn through which it
may promote resistance. Indeed, sixteen potential targets
that mediate proliferation and survival are downstream of
Egr-1 and are coordinately regulated in resistant cells and
LSCs (Figure 7A). Of these, four targets are already noted
to associate with TKI-resistance. For example, CD44, a
cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and
migration, and SIRT1, an NAD-dependent deacetylase,
are elevated in imatinib resistant samples [39, 65]. Also
inhibition of the NFκB pathway can overcome imatinib
resistance [66]. Our pathway analysis suggests therefore
that NFκB may be a mediator of the pathway, and a target
of its action (Figure 7A). Additional targets include betacatenin signaling, which is known to protect LSCs from
TKIs [67], as well as TNF and VEGFA, which may be
involved in other types of treatment resistance in CML
[68, 69]. The remaining ten targets have yet to be studied
in the context of treatment resistance in CML (Figure
7A). Thus, our data suggest a number of potential novel
targets downstream of Egr-1 that may contribute to TKIresistance in CML that will be the subject of future studies.
Together, our findings suggest that the NOX2/Egr-1/
Fyn signaling axis may represent a novel target in TKIresistant cancers, particularly in a population of treatmentrefractory stem cells. Unfortunately, as a transcription
factor, Egr-1 is difficult to specifically target with
therapeutics. Also, though the classic NOX inhibitors such
as the ones employed in this study (apocynin and DPI)
lower NOX activity, they display a non-specific pattern
of NOX-targeting, consequently limiting their clinical
utility [70]. However, more specific NOX2 inhibitors
are currently under evaluation including the p47phox
binding peptide, NOX2ds-tat [71], providing promise
for the clinical application of NOX2-targeted strategies.
Collectively, these findings indicate that targeting NOX2
activation via inhibition of p47phox represents a plausible
means of targeting TKI-resistant malignancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All injections were 1 µM. NADPH oxidase activity was
measured using an NADP+/NADPH assay kit (Abcam)
per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1.5 X 106 K562
or K562R cells, or 2.0 X 105 cells/mL GBM cells, were
lysed by freeze/thaw in NADPH extraction buffer. To
detect NADP+, samples were decomposed by heating as
per manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were loaded
onto 96-well plate and compared to standard curve as per
instructions.

Chemicals and cell lines
Imatinib and dasatinib were purchased from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA). DPI, apocynin, rotenone,
and NAC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Egr-1 siRNA was purchased from ThermoScientific
(Pittsburgh, PA) and p47phox and Fyn siRNA from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). K562 cells, originally
isolated from pleural effusion of a 53 year old female
with BC-CML and are granulocytic in nature [72],
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI1640 with 10%
FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
K562R cells, previously confirmed to be TKI-resistant
without BCR-ABL1 mutation, were kindly provided by
Drs. Ellen Weisberg and James D. Griffin [32] and were
cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin containing 0.5 µM
imatinib. KBM7 cells were isolated from a 39 year old
male in BC and are near haploid [73]. KBM7 and KMB7R
(previously found to be TKI-resistant without mutation of
BCR-ABL1) cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Zeev
Estrov [31, 73] and were cultured in IMDM with 10%
FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The human GBM cell line U87-MG stably overexpressing
wild-type EGFR, EGFRΔIII or EGFR-R108K was
cultured in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS, 2 mM
glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
The cells were routinely supplemented with 50 μg/ml of
Zeocin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Patient-derived
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) [74] were provided by
Drs. Frederick Lang and Erik Sulman and were cultured
in DMEM/F12 containing 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma-Aldrich)
and bFGF (Life Technologies). All cell lines were cultured
in 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Data mining
Data were mined from Radich and colleagues for
Fyn, NCF1, NCF2, and NOX2 expression in TKI-resistant
patients (n = 15) and normalized to expression of blast
crisis patients (n = 28) [41]. TKI-resistant patients were
patients who relapsed after initial treatment response,
presented again with chronic phase disease, and had
various BCR-ABL1 mutational statuses. These data
could not be sub-divided by mutational status as they
were presented as an averaged value. The Oncomine
database was queried to identify alterations occurring in
gene expression. Oncomine 4.5 database analysis tool is
available with a subscription at http://www.oncomine.
org. For GBM, selected data [75] was compared for gene
expression levels in primary glioblastoma tumor samples
relative to normal brain controls. For ingenuity pathway
analysis, pathway connections between Egr-1, Fyn, and
p47phox were analyzed in imatinib resistant cell lines
compared to parental cells [39]. These targets were then
compared to targets in LSCs from BC patients compared
to CP [48].

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription reaction
was performed for each sample (1 μg of RNA) via iScript
RT kit (Bio-Rad) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Realtime PCR was carried using the iTaq Universal SYBR
Green PCR master mix in a 20 µL total volume. The PCR
primer sequences and conditions for human Fyn [37], Egr1 [76], NOX-4 [45] and p47phox [45] were previously
described. Relative gene expression was calculated
by determination of the cycle threshold (Ct) value and
normalizing to actin Ct values.

Assessment of the redox environment
Reactive oxygen species were measured by staining
with DCF or dihydroethidium (HE). Briefly, equal cell
numbers were washed with PBS then stained with DCF
or HE (Life Technologies) in 1X PBS for 30 min at 37°C
in the dark. Samples were centrifuged and re-suspended
in PBS then analyzed on the FL-1 or FL-3 channel of
a flow cytometer, respectively. Mean fluorescence of
10,000 cells was then normalized to controls for each
experiment. To measure mitochondrial respiration, 8 X
105 K562 or K562R cells were plated into seahorse 96well plate using Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Mitochondrial respiration was then measured using the
XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit and XFe extracellular flux
analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA).

Detection of protein
Cells were lysed in triton lysis buffer (PBS with
1% Triton X-100; 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5; and 150 mM
NaCl) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN)  for 1 hour at 4°C. Lysates were then
cleared by centrifugation and protein abundance assessed

by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Fifty
micrograms of sample was added to laemelli buffer then
boiled for 5 minutes. Lysates were then subjected to SDSPAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane (BioRad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% milk and
then exposed to Fyn (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), Egr-1 (Cell Signaling Technology), p47phox (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), or Actin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies
overnight. Membranes were washed three times in tris
buffered saline containing 1% triton (TBST) for 30
minutes followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
(GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Proteins were visualized
with ECL (Bio-Rad) and densitometry was measured with
NIH ImageJ (Bethesda, MA).

earlier. For CD34+ isolation, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were transferred to MACS magnetic bead separation
column for separation as per manufacturer’s instructions
(Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA). CD34- lysate was
collected as flow through and CD34+ cells were collected
from the column. Cells were then lysed and subjected to
western blotting as described earlier.

Knockdown experiments
Egr-1 or Fyn-directed siRNA was electroporated into
K562R cells utilizing an Amaxa nucleofection machine
(Lonza, Allendale, NJ) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. P47phox siRNA was transfected into all cell
lines using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Knockdown was
evaluated by western blotting as described earlier. After
knockdown (24 hours for Fyn and Egr-1, 72 hours for
p47phox), cells were treated with imatinib or dasatinib
for 48 hours. Proliferation was then measured using
hemocytometer counting with trypan blue staining or a
ViCell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
CA).

Patient samples and immunohistochemistry
Patient specimens were collected after informed
consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. TMA studies were initiated under approval
from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center Institutional Review Board. Formalin-fixed and
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from bone
marrow biopsies or clots were collected from CML
patients in CP (n = 10), AP (n = 6) or BC (n = 10) and
amassed in a TMA as previously described [34, 77].
Positive control (FFPE cell block prepared from K562
cells) and negative control (normal lung epithelium
tissue) slides were stained at the same time with the TMA.
Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated then subjected
to antigen retrieval for 2.5 min. Thereafter, slides were
washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST),
and 0.03% H2O2 was added for 15 min. Slides were then
blocked for 30 min using serum-free protein block before
incubation overnight at 4°C with anti-Egr-1 antibody
(Ab54966; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) diluted 1:150 in
5% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, detection
was achieved by addition of the biotinylated secondary
antibodies for 30 min, followed by streptavidin for 30 min.
The slides were developed using 3,3´-diaminodbenzidine
tetrahydrochloride substrate (DAB) kit (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA) that includes horseradish peroxidase, and hematoxylin
was used for counter staining. Microscopic evaluation was
performed without knowledge of disease stage or clinical
outcome. The percentage of positively stained cells was
determined by counting at least 100 neoplastic cells in
each of the TMA cores. Photomicrographs were obtained
using a Nikon Microphot FXA microscope (Nikon
Instruments, Melville, NY) and an Olympus DP70 camera
(Olympus America, Melville, NY). 
For western blots, samples from CP, AP, and BC
bone marrow and peripheral blood were obtained and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then thawed
and red blood cells were lysed by incubation in 1:1
PBS:ACK lysis buffer for 10 minutes on ice. Samples
were centrifuged then lysed with lysis buffer as described
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GSC sphere-formation assay
Sphere formation was performed as previously
described [18]. Briefly, cells were dissociated and
transfected with either control or Fyn siRNA (30 pmol)
and then plated 24 hours later at a density of 5,000 cells
per mL. Spheres > 50 μM were counted 10 days later.

Statistical analyses
Unless otherwise stated, values listed in figures are
expressed as the mean ± SEM of at least three replicates.
Statistical comparisons were made using GraphPad Prism
4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA)
by Student’s t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered
significant.
