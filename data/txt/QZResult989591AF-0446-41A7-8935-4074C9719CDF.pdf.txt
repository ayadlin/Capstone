ABSTRACT
The overall survival of lung cancer patients remains dismal despite the availability
of targeted therapies. Oncofetal protein SALL4 is a novel cancer target. We herein
report that SALL4 was aberrantly expressed in a subset of lung cancer patients with
poor survival. SALL4 silencing by RNA interference or SALL4 peptide inhibitor treatment
led to impaired lung cancer cell growth. Expression profiling of SALL4-knockdown
cells demonstrated that both the EGFR and IGF1R signaling pathways were affected.
Connectivity Map analysis revealed the HDAC inhibitor entinostat as a potential drug in
treating SALL4-expressing cancers, and this was confirmed in 17 lung cancer cell lines.
In summary, we report for the first time that entinostat can target SALL4-positive lung
cancer. This lays the foundation for future clinical studies evaluating the therapeutic
efficacy of entinostat in SALL4-positive lung cancer patients.

SALL4 is well established to be one of the critical
stem cell factors for the maintenance of pluripotency and
self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs)[12, 13].
Aberrant SALL4 expression has been reported in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and a panel of solid tumors,
including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer,
and endometrial cancer [14–19]. Targeting SALL4 as a
potential therapeutic strategy has been demonstrated in
AML and HCC by interrupting the interaction between
SALL4 and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex [15,
16]. Aberrant SALL4 expression in lung cancer patients
has been reported, and the detection of SALL4 mRNA
expression has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for
lung cancer patients [20, 21]. However, the functional
role(s) of SALL4 in NSCLC and its related mechanism, as
well as its therapeutic potential in lung cancer still remain
unknown. To answer these questions, we first examined
the oncogenic role of aberrant SALL4 protein expression
in human NSCLC. The follow-up mechanistic studies
demonstrated that SALL4 affected both the EGFR and

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in
both men and women in the United States and worldwide.
It can be divided into small cell lung cancer (~20%) and
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, ~80%)[1]. Major
treatment options for NSCLC, depending on the stages of
disease, include surgery, radiation, and platinum doublet
chemotherapy. In the past decade, the discovery of EGFR
mutations and EML4-ALK fusions has led to advances in
the treatment of NSCLC through the use of targeted therapies
[2–4]. While other driver mutations, including HER2, MET,
NRAS, BRAF, FGFR1, PIK3CA, AKT1, RET, and ROS1 may
represent viable therapeutic targets, overall they occur only at
low frequency in NSCLC, with more than 50% of cases still
lacking defined driver mutation [5–9]. Therefore, therapeutic
options are still limited for many advanced NSCLC patients.
In addition, acquired resistance to the existing targeted agents
and disease recurrence present further challenges and highlight
the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies [10, 11].

IGF1R signaling pathways by suppressing the expression
of one of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, CBL-B,
probably through its reported interaction with the HDAC
complex. Notably, our preclinical data indicates that the
SALL4-expressing lung cancer cells were more sensitive
to the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) entinostat
(MS-275) treatment, suggesting that lung cancer patients
with SALL4 overexpression may benefit from treatment
with entinostat.

Within the NSCLC cases, SALL4 was found to be positive
in 12% of adenocarcinomas (ADC) (n=100), 19% of
adenocarcinoma in situ (n=21) and 23% of squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) (n=52). In addition, we evaluated
RNA expression of SALL4 in paired tumor and normal
tissues from 12 lung cancer patients. Seven of these 12
lung cancer patients had increased SALL4 expression,
and overall, there was a statistically significant increase
in SALL4 expression in lung cancer tissues as compared
to adjacent normal lung tissues (P=0.04) (Supplementary
Figure S1).
To validate the observation from our cohort of
primary patient samples, we utilized the published
expression profiling data on lung cancers (Accession
GSE31210) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database [22]. SALL4 transcript level was analyzed in
226 adenocarcinomas and 20 adjacent normal lung tissue
samples. The expression of SALL4 was significantly
increased in cancer tissues compared to normal controls
(p<0.0001) (Figure 1b), confirming our observation
from the immunohistochemistry staining. Using the
same dataset, we further evaluated lung cancer patients
with known mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and ALK. Lung
cancer patients with EGFR and/or KRAS mutations
were found to have higher SALL4 expression, while
patients with ALK mutations did not have significantly
higher SALL4 expression (Supplementary Figure S2).

RESULTS
Aberrant SALL4 expression is detected in
a subset of lung cancer and high SALL4
expression is correlated with poor survival
To determine whether SALL4 is aberrantly expressed
in lung cancer, we performed immunohistochemistry
(IHC) to analyze the protein expression level of SALL4
in a cohort of lung cancer patients from the archives of
the National University Hospital, Singapore, with normal
lung tissues serving as control. Table 1 illustrates the
demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of
these patients. We observed elevated SALL4 expression in
a subset of lung cancer patients compared to normal lung
tissues (Figure 1a). Among non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs), 16.2% were positive for SALL4 expression.

Furthermore, using the same dataset, we evaluated
the prognostic value of SALL4 expression in lung
cancer patients. Using median expression level as the
cutoff value, we found that high SALL4 expression in
lung cancer was significantly correlated with reduced
relapse-free survival and overall survival (Figure 1c),
suggesting that patients with high SALL4 expression
have poorer survival advantage. Similar observation
was also seen in another cohort of samples from
the GEO database – elevated SALL4 expression is
observed in lung cancer patients (Accession GSE19188,
Supplementary Figure S3a) [23]. Further analysis
showed that there is no significant difference, in terms
of SALL4 expression level, between different subtypes
of NSCLCs (Supplementary Figure S3b). To investigate
whether gene sets that have prognostic values are
enriched in SALL4-expressing lung carcinomas, we
carried out Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

by using the GSE19188 dataset. Indeed, we observed
enrichment of gene sets upregulated in lung cancers with
poor survival (P < 0.001) in SALL4-expressing group.
On the other hand, gene sets that are enriched in lung
cancers with good survival (P < 0.001) are enriched
in the SALL4-negative group (Supplementary Figure
S3c). These observations were confirmed by a third
published primary lung adenocarcinoma dataset from
the TCGA database. SALL4 expression was significantly
upregulated in adenocarcinoma tissues compared to the
matched normal lung tissues (P < 0.001) (Supplementary
Figure S3d). Comparing 61 samples with the highest
and lowest SALL4 expression from the same dataset, we
observed significant survival advantage for the patients
with low SALL4 expression (P = 0.017) (Supplementary
Figure S3d). These data collectively demonstrated that
aberrant SALL4 expression is observed in NSCLCs and
SALL4 has prognostic value in lung cancer.

SALL4 expression is essential for tumorigenicity
of lung cancer cells

(Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together, these data
suggest that SALL4 has a functional role and is a feasible
drug target in lung cancer.

To investigate if SALL4 has a functional role in
tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells, we first screened
16 NSCLC cell lines for SALL4 expression by using
qRT-PCR in order to select for appropriate models for
downstream functional studies (Supplementary Figure
S4a). ADC cell line H522 and large cell carcinoma
(LCC) cell line H661 showed the highest SALL4 RNA
expression level among the 16 cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S4a), which was confirmed by immunoblotting
at protein expression level (Supplementary Figure S4b).
Moderate endogenous SALL4 expression was detected in
both H292 and PC-9 cell lines, and low or undetectable
SALL4 expression was seen in HCC827 and H1299 cells
(Supplementary Figure S4a). Notably, H292 lung cancer
cells have EGFR amplification while PC-9 lung cancer
cells harbor the EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation.
Next, to investigate the functional role of SALL4
in lung cancer, SALL4 expression was downregulated
by lentiviral-mediated delivery of SALL4-specific short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) to the high SALL4-expressing
lung cancer cell lines (H661, H522, H292 and PC-9). The
specificity of this SALL4 shRNA has been validated in our
previous studies [15, 19]. The SALL4 shRNA transductions
resulted in 50-90% inhibition of SALL4 expression at
protein and mRNA levels in H661, H522, H292 and PC-9
cell lines (Figure 2a). We evaluated the effects of SALL4
knockdown on cell viability of these cells (Figure 2b).
SALL4 shRNA treatment markedly reduced the number of
viable cells compared to scramble shRNA control treatment
(Figure 2b). Furthermore, the oncogenic role of SALL4 was
investigated in an in vitro foci formation assay and an in
vivo lung cancer xenograft mouse model using H661 and
PC-9 cells with downregulated SALL4 expression (Figure
2c–2e). SALL4 downregulation significantly impaired the
tumorigenic potential of H661 cells in vitro (Figures 2c and
2d). In the in vivo xenograft assay, shRNA-treated PC-9
cells were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice
and monitored for tumor development. SALL4 knockdown
dramatically inhibited tumor growth compared to scramble
shRNA control group (Figure 2e). These data suggest that
SALL4 expression is critical for lung tumor cell growth in
vitro and in vivo.
We have recently described a SALL4 peptide as a
competitive inhibitor to antagonize the oncogenic function
of SALL4 in AML [15] and HCC [15, 17]. In our present
study, we further evaluated the anti-proliferative effects
of this 12-amino acid peptide in SALL4-expressing lung
cancer cell lines. Treatment with 10 μM of TAT peptidetagged SALL4 peptide (TAT-SALL4) led to a 30-50%
reduction of cell viability in all three SALL4-positive
lung cancer cell lines (H661, H522, and PC-9), while no
effect was observed on non-SALL4-expressing H1299
cells, compared to control peptides (TAT, or TAT-Con)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Downregulation of SALL4 blocks both IGF1R
and EGFR signaling pathways
To elucidate the potential mechanism(s) of SALL4
in lung cancer, we performed microarray gene expression
profiling on H661 cells treated with scramble shRNA
control and a SALL4-specific shRNA. Combination of oneway ANOVA analysis and pathway analysis using Pathway
Interaction Database (PID) showed that both EGFR (P =
1.03E-03) and IGF1R (P = 1.37E-05) signaling pathways
were significantly affected by SALL4 downregulation.
However, further analysis showed that SALL4 knockdown
had little effects on the RNA expression levels of IGF1R
and EGFR in H661 cells (Figure 3a). Nonetheless, SALL4
depletion led to decreased protein expression of total IGF1R
and phospho-IGF1R in H661 and H522 cell lines (Figure
3b, left panel), as well as reduced protein expression of total
EGFR and phospho-EGFR in H292 and PC-9 cells (Figure
3b, right panel), despite the unchanged RNA expression
levels. Furthermore, SALL4 knockdown also inactivated
the IGF1R/EGFR downstream intermediate target AKT,
as seen from downregulation of phospho-AKT, but not
MAPK in the four lung cancer cell lines examined (Figure
3b). These data suggest that depletion of SALL4 expression
in lung cancer cells blocks both the EGFR and IGF1R
signaling pathways, albeit not through direct regulation of
EGFR and IGF1R mRNA expression.

SALL4 regulates EGFR and IGF1R signaling
pathways through CBL-B ubiquitin ligase
It is known that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
including EGFR and IGF1R, can be negatively regulated
by CBL RING ubiquitin ligases [24, 25]. Interestingly,
our microarray data showed that loss of SALL4 led to
an upregulation of CBLB, a member of the CBL RING
ubiquitin ligases, which was further confirmed by qRTPCR (Figure 4a). In addition, SALL4 knockdown induced
CBL-B protein expression in four lung cancer cell lines
examined (H661, H522, PC-9, and H292) (Figure 4b).
The effects of SALL4 on CBL-B expression were further
evaluated by western blotting after overexpression of
SALL4 in a normal lung epithelial cell line (Beas2B).
Ectopic expression of both SALL4 isoforms A and
B suppressed CBL-B expression (Figure 4c). These
results suggest that SALL4 augments EGFR and IGF1R
expression in lung cancer through the downregulation of
CBL-B ubiquitin ligase.
We next performed SALL4 chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR to investigate
if SALL4 binds directly on the promoter region of
CBLB, thereby repressing its expression. Significant

enrichment of SALL4 binding on CBLB promoter
was observed, as compared to the isotype control
(Figure 4d), suggesting that SALL4 might regulate
the expression of CBL-B directly by transcription
repression. Figure 4e shows the enrichment of SALL4
protein in our ChIP sample.

limited by their sub-optimal in vivo delivery efficiency.
To search for potential existing drug(s) to treat SALL4expressing cancers, we conducted Connectivity Map
(cMap) analysis [26, 27]. The SALL4 gene signature
obtained from either our knockdown experiments or
from data mining on primary lung cancer patients was
compared to the drug signatures through the cMap
site (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) with over
thousands of expression profiling results upon drug
treatments. The outcome of comparison was given a
score from +1 (maximum positive correlation) to -1
(maximum negative correlation) based on the extent
of correlation between the two gene signatures. In our
case, the drugs that received a score close to -1 are

most likely to have therapeutic values for the SALL4expressing lung cancer cells since the drug signatures
are in a reverse correlation with the SALL4 gene
signature.
We first performed cMap analysis using one set of
SALL4 gene signature generated from the comparison
between normal human control versus primary lung cancer
samples (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). A separate
SALL4 gene signature generated from differentially
expressed genes following SALL4 knockdown in the
lung cancer cell line H661 (Supplementary Table S3)
was also used by cMap. Comparative analysis identified
overlapping of three candidate drugs in all three analyses
using the various gene signatures (Supplementary Table
S4). Intriguingly, entinostat (MS-275), a HDACi, was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

among the three common drugs. This, however, was not
unexpected, as we have reported in our previous studies
that one of the main functions of SALL4 is to act as a
transcription repressor by interacting with the nucleosome
remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex that
comprises of HDAC1 and HDAC2 [28]. As an HDACi,
entinostat preferentially inhibits HDAC1 as compared to
HDAC3 [29], and has been used in clinical trials to treat
lung cancer patients [30].

SALL4-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to
HDAC inhibitor entinostat treatment
To validate the cMap result, we conducted further
studies using the HDACi entinostat. A panel of 17

The entinostat sensitivity was then compared between
these two groups (Figure 5b). A negative correlation
between the IC50 of entinostat and SALL4 expression
level was observed, suggesting that lung cancer cells
with high SALL4 expression were more sensitive to
entinostat treatment (P = 0.03) (Figure 5b). To further
evaluate the correlation between SALL4 expression and
entinostat treatment sensitivity, SALL4 isoforms A and
B were overexpressed in SALL4 negative lung cancer
cell line H1299 (Figure 5c). Ectopic expression of

lung cancer cell lines with different expression levels
of SALL4 was evaluated for their drug sensitivity to
entinostat. We first noticed that lung cancer cells with
high SALL4 expression levels such as H661 and PC-9
cells were more sensitive to entinostat treatment than
those with low SALL4 expression level, such as H1299
cells. The IC50 values of entinostat at day 3 were 1.17
μM for H661, 0.88 μM for PC-9, and 7.7 μM for H1299,
respectively (Figure 5a). Furthermore, based on SALL4
mRNA expression level, 17 lung cancer cell lines were
stratified into “SALL4 high” and “SALL4 low” groups

DISCUSSION

SALL4 in these cells led to increased sensitivity of the
cells to entinostat treatment, as indicated by a reduced
IC50 value (Figure 5d).
Since SALL4 can repress its downstream target
gene expression through its interaction with the HDACcontaining complex NuRD, we reason that entinostat, an
HDACi, can potentially affect the repressive function of
SALL4. We have shown in this study that SALL4 can
repress CBL-B expression in lung cancer cells. We next
examined whether the expression of CBL-B in these cells
was affected upon entinostat treatment. The expression
levels of CBL-B were increased significantly only in
SALL4-expressing H661 and PC-9 cell lines and not
in SALL4-non-expressing H1299 cells after entinostat
treatment (Figure 5e). Additionally, entinostat treatment
led to a decrease in SALL4 expression levels (Figure 5f),
and abolished the enrichment of SALL4 binding on CBLB
promoter as observed from SALL4 ChIP-qPCR in H661
cells (Figure 5g).
To our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the
first time that high SALL4 expression is associated with a
more sensitive response to entinostat treatment in human
lung cancer cells. Therefore, SALL4 might be a good
predictive marker for entinostat, and possibly other HDAC
inhibitors in lung cancer.

SALL4 is an important stem cell factor [12, 13],
and it has recently emerged as an oncofetal protein [15].
Aberrant SALL4 expression has been reported in a myriad
of solid tumors including HCC [15, 16, 31], endometrial
cancer [19], ovarian cancer [32], breast cancer [33],
gastric cancer [18, 34], lung cancer [20, 21], and germ
cell tumors [35–37], as well as in leukemias [14, 38, 39].
Its druggability has been proposed in liver cancer and
AML [15]. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer
deaths in the United States (US) and worldwide. Recently,
molecular targeted therapies including EGFR and ALK
inhibitors have resulted in some improvement in the
treatment response in selected groups of NSCLC patients.
However, EGFR and ALK aberrations collectively account
for only approximately 15% of all NSCLCs in the US, and
the overall survival rate for lung cancer patients remains
extremely poor (5-year survival rate of ~15%). Therefore,
more effective therapeutics are needed for lung cancer
patients, particularly for the ones that are negative for
EGFR mutations.
In our present study, we first examined SALL4
expression in a cohort of primary lung cancer samples
using immunohistochemical staining. 16% of 173

primary lung cancer patients demonstrated positive
SALL4 expression, whereas no expression of SALL4
was observed in normal lung tissues (except for the basal
layer of bronchiolar epithelium), consistent with published
results by other groups [37, 40, 41]. The observation that
SALL4 is overexpressed in a subgroup of lung cancers
was further validated by analysis of published gene
expression profiles of lung cancers in public databases.
Importantly, we have also observed positive SALL4
expression in EGFR mutation negative lung cancer
patients. The correlation between SALL4 expression and
poorer patient survival in lung cancer is consistent with
our observations from HCC, endometrial cancer and
myelodysplastic syndrome. The unique expression pattern
of SALL4 in lung cancer suggests that it can potentially
be a good drug target for personalized medicine, targeting
the lung cancer subtypes that cannot be treated by current
targeted therapies like EGFR and ALK inhibitors.
To date, targeted therapies have reshaped the
management of various types of cancers including
NSCLC. EGFR is frequently strongly activated and
overexpressed in NSCLC. Oncogenic EGFR mutation is
a compelling therapeutic target in NSCLCs and numerous
agents have been developed to target this moiety [42–44].
However, cancer cells may circumvent the drug effects
of EGFR inhibitors by activating alternative pathways,
thus limiting the efficacy of such therapeutic approaches
[45, 46]. One of these alternative pathways is the IGF1R
pathway, which is an important cell survival pathway. In
the setting of NSCLC, increased expression of IGF1R
appears to be detected in up to 70% of patients [47].
Also IGF1R overexpression was found to correlate
with decreased efficacy of EGFR targeting, suggesting
the importance of IGF1R signaling in EGFR inhibitors
drug resistance [48, 49]. All these studies suggest that
co-targeting of both IGF1R and EGFR represent a more
viable therapeutic option for NSCLC.
In this study, we show that depletion of SALL4
by shRNA resulted in a decreased in cell viability and
tumorigenicity of SALL4-positive lung cancer cells,
which were associated with dysregulation of both EGFR
and IGF1R signaling pathways. The regulatory effects
of SALL4 on these two pathways seem to be indirect
as SALL4 had no direct effect on the mRNA expression
of EGFR/IGF1R. Instead, SALL4 silencing induced the
expression of CBL-B, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, both at the
protein and mRNA levels. Members of the CBL protein
family (CBL, CBL-B and CBL-C) have emerged as
dominant “activated RTK-selective” ubiquitin ligases,
which serve a unique role as activation-induced feedback
negative regulators of RTKs, including EGFR, PDGFR,
MET, KIT, and IGF1R. Various studies have demonstrated
that CBL protein-dependent ubiquitination targets
activated RTKs for degradation either by promoting their
proteasomal degradation or by facilitating their endocytic
sorting into lysosomes. Data from lung cancer cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines suggest that SALL4 downregulation may result in
degradation of EGFR and IGF1R proteins, possibly in part
through CBL-B. This model needs to be verified further by
rescue experiments in the future.
We have previously identified a peptide that can
block the oncogenic function of SALL4 by interrupting
the interaction between SALL4 and the NuRD complex
[15]. While the development of SALL4-specific
inhibitor(s) that mimic this SALL4 peptide is ongoing,
we set out to search for existing drugs that can potentially
treat SALL4-expressing cancers. Using cMap predication,
we identified that the drug signature from HDAC inhibitor
entinostat significantly correlates with SALL4 gene
signature. Using a panel of 17 lung cancer cell lines with
varying SALL4 expression levels as a preclinical model,
we further confirmed that high SALL4 expression lung
cancer cells were more sensitive to entinostat treatment.
Entinostat can induce the expression of CBLB, a gene that
is repressed by SALL4 in lung cancer cells, representing
a potential mechanism for the sensitivity of SALL4expressing lung cancer cells to this drug. entinostat is an
HDACi targeting class I enzymes HDAC1 to HDAC3.
Recent clinical trials conducted on patients with lung
cancer reveal that combination of entinostat with existing
lung cancer treatments, such as erlotinib or azacitidine,
appears promising, particularly for the carefully selected
subgroups of patients [30]. Currently, there is no predictive
biomarker for entinostat for lung cancer treatment. Our
preclinical studies using a panel of 17 lung cancer cell
lines suggest that SALL4 could be a useful predictive
marker for entinostat. Future clinical studies are needed
to investigate whether SALL4 can be used as a biomarker
in selecting lung cancer patients who may benefit from
combination therapy with entinostat.
In summary, this is the first comprehensive study
on the role of SALL4 in lung cancer. We have evaluated
SALL4 expression in lung cancer in large cohorts
of patients, and observed that SALL4 expression is
upregulated in a subset (about 16%) of these patients
including EGFR mutation negative cases. As reported in
other types of cancers, SALL4 plays a critical role in lung
cancer cell survival. This is supported by genetic (SALL4
knockdown) and pharmacological (peptide) studies.
SALL4-expressing lung cancer cells are more sensitive
to entinostat treatment. Overall, our studies suggest that
targeting SALL4 by entinostat is a novel approach for lung
cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples
173 cases of primary lung cancer tissues (52 SCC,
100 ADC, and 21 BAC) and 166 cases of matched normal
lung tissues from the archives of the National University
Hospital, Singapore were included in this study. Ethics

Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS IRB 09-261).

in F10 containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin,
L-glutamine, amphotericin, Mitotracker+, and bovine
pituitary extract. Transduction was carried out as
described previously48.

Antibodies and reagents
All phospho-antibodies (pIGF1R #3024, pEGFR
#2234, pAKT #9271, pMAPK #9101) and polyclonal
antibodies to AKT (#9272) and IGF1R (#3027) were from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal
mouse antibodies to SALL4 (#sc-101147) and CBL-B
(#sc-1705), and polyclonal antibody to EGFR (#sc-03)
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
Polyclonal antibody to MAPK (#61-7400) was from
Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). HDAC
inhibitors (trichostatin A and entinostat) were provided by
Dr. James Bradner’s lab at DFCI.

Cell viability analysis
Lung cancer cells were plated at 5,000 cells/well
in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate (Falcon, Lincoln NJ) and
cultured in RPMI1640 for 24 hours before transduction
with lentiviral empty vector, SALL4 shRNA, or treatment
with HDAC inhibitors (entinostat or TSA), or TAT-SALL4
peptide (YGRKKRRQRRRMSRRKQAKPQHI)/TAT-con
peptide(YGRKKRRQRRR). Cell viability was assessed
1-5 days after transduction or inhibitor treatment using
the MTT assay as described14, 22, 48. Data were normalized
to the empty vector group or DMSO. All assays were
performed in quadruplicate wells, and were averaged from
two independent experiments for each cell line.

Cell lines
Lung tumor cell lines (PC-9, H460, A549, H1299,
H520, A427, H292, H441, H322, H1650, H1395,
HCC827, H3122, H1975, H3255, and H23) and a normal
lung epithelial cell line (Beas2B) were kindly provided by
Drs. Daniel G. Tenen and Susumu Kobayashi. H522 and
H661 cell lines were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC).

Foci formation assay
Lung cancer cells (H661) were treated with
scrambled shRNA (Scr-sh) or SALL4 shRNA (SALL4sh). Three days after lentiviral transduction, cells were
plated at 500 cells per well in a 6-well plate (Corning,
NY) and cultured in RPMI1640 medium for 2 weeks.
Colony formation was observed by staining with crystal
violet solution (0.1% crystal violet/ 25% methanol) and
the number of colonies was manually counted. All assays
were performed in triplicate wells and averaged from two
independent experiments.

SALL4 immunohistochemistry
IHC staining was performed according to the
standard techniques as described previously [15].

Lentiviral SALL4 overexpression and SALL4
shRNA constructs and lentivirus packaging

Xenotransplant murine models
All experimental procedures involving animals were
conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines
set forth by the Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB animal
protocol number 11-09-2022). Eight to 10 week-old NOD/
SCID mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility.
Athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously with
PC-9 cells expressing SALL4-targeting shRNA on one flank
(n=3 each) and scramble shRNA control on the other flank
(n=3). 2 × 106 infected cells on puromycin selection were
resuspended in BD Matrigel and implanted subcutaneously
at each injection site. After injection, mice were examined
and tumor volumes were measured at various time points.
Tumor volume was calculated by using the formula, tumor
volume = (length × width× height)/2. Mice were killed by
CO2 inhalation and necropsied 4 weeks after injection, and
then tumor volume was evaluated.

Human SALL4A or SALL4B fragments were
subcloned into a modified lentiviral vector (FUW-LucmCh-puro) with mCherry and puromycin selection markers.
Lentivirus preparations were produced by cotransfecting
empty vector pLKO.1puro with SALL4 shRNA or FUW
with SALL4 ORF, and helper virus packaging plasmids
pCMVΔR8.91 and pMD.G (at a 10:10:1 ratio) into 293T
cells. Transfections were carried out using lipofectamine
and PLUS reagent. Lentiviruses were harvested at 24,
36, 48, and 60 hrs post-transfection, and frozen at -80oC
in aliquots at appropriate amounts for infection. Validated
shRNAs were used for SALL4 knockdowns. The sequences
for SALL4 shRNA and scrambled shRNA are as follows:
SALL4 shRNA: 5’-GCCTTGAAACAAGCCAAGCTA-3’;
and Scr-shRNA: 5’-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG-3’.

buffer (20mM Tris, pH8/ 85mM KCl/ 0.5% NP-40 and
1X cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail), and the nuclei
was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10mM TrisHCl, pH7.5/ 1% NP-40/ 0.5% NaDOC/ 0.1% SDS/ 1X
cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail). The nuclei were
then sonicated using the Biorupter (30s on/off pulses for
10 cycles). The salt concentration of the sheared chromatin
was adjusted to 500mM NaCl. Immunoprecipitations
were then carried out with 1.9μg of SALL4 antibody in
ChIP dilution buffer (16.7mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1/ 500mM
NaCl/ 0.01% SDS/ 1.1% Triton X-100/ 1.2mM EDTA)
overnight. Bead complexes were washed twice with RIPA
buffer high salt (500mM), then twice with LiCl buffer
(10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1/ 1mM EDTA/ 1% NaDOC/ 1%
NP-40/ 250mM LiCl), and finally twice in TE buffer.
Protein-DNA complexes were then eluted with 100μl
of ChIP elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH8/ 5mM
EDTA/ 300mM NaCl/ 0.1% SDS) and 16μl of reversecrosslinking buffer (250mM Tris-HCl, pH6.4/ 1.25M
NaCl/ 62.5mM EDTA/ 5mg/ml Proteinase k/ 62.5mg/ml
RNAse A) by incubated at 65°C overnight. DNA samples
were then PCR purified with QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and analysed by qPCR. ChIPqPCR primers used were: CBLB promoter forward: 5’CAGCATCAATAATACCCAAAATTCGACC-3’, reverse:
5’- CGATGGAGGAAGATGCAGTGGTAC-3’.

Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A RIN value of 8.0
and above was considered to indicate a satisfactory
sample quality. Gene expression array was carried out
as described previously48. The microarray data was
deposited in the GEO database with the Accession
number GSE68959.

GSEA analysis
Gene expression data of lung cancers was extracted
from the GEO database (accession number: GSE31210
and GSE19188). Before GSEA, all lung cancer samples
were divided into two groups according to their SALL4
expression levels: SALL4 high and SALL4 low. GSEA
was then performed based on normalized data using
GSEA v2.0 tool (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/) for
identification of enriched gene sets between the SALL4
high and SALL4 low groups.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± s.d. from at least
three independent experiments, unless otherwise stated.
Statistical significance between the two groups was
determined by Student’s t-test or Pearson’s Chi-squared
(χ2) test (GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (La Jolla, CA,
USA). Log-rank test was used for survival analysis. The
value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant
and is indicated by an asterisk.

Primers
The qRT-PCR assays for SALL4, EGFR, IGF1R and
CBLB were performed using the following primers: SALL4

-3’17. CBLB sense: 5’-GAGAGCTGGTAGTTAGTAGC
ATGTTGA-3’ and anti-sense: 5’- AATTCCAATAATGA
ACCCAATAGATTAGTTA -3’. As controls, GAPDH was
amplified using the following primers: GAPDH sense:
5’-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3’ and anti-sense:
5’-TGGAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3’. All primers
were obtained from Invitrogen. The comparative Ct (cycle
threshold) method was used to determine RNA expression
fold differences in lung cancer cell lines. The data points (run
in triplicate assays) were normalized to GAPDH.
