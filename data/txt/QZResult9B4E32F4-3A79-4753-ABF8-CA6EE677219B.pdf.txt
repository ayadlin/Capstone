ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma is the main malignant primary bone tumor in children and
adolescents for whom the prognosis remains poor, especially when metastases are
present at diagnosis. Because we recently demonstrated that TGF-β/Smad cascade
plays a crucial role in osteosarcoma metastatic progression, we investigated the
effect of halofuginone, identified as an inhibitor of the TGF-β/Smad3 cascade, on
osteosarcoma progression. A preclinical model of osteosarcoma was used to evaluate
the impact of halofuginone on tumor growth, tumor microenvironment and metastasis
development. In vivo experiments showed that halofuginone reduces primary tumor
growth and lung metastases development. In vitro experiments demonstrated
that halofuginone decreases cell viability mainly by its ability to induce caspase-3
dependent cell apoptosis. Moreover, halofuginone inhibits the TGF-β/Smad3 cascade
and the response of TGF-β key targets involved in the metastases dissemination
process such as MMP-2. In addition, halofuginone treatment affects the "vicious cycle"
established between tumor and bone cells, and therefore the tumor-associated bone
osteolysis. Together, these results demonstrate that halofuginone decreased primary
osteosarcoma development and associated lung metastases by targeting both the
tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Using halofuginone may be a promising
therapeutic strategy against tumor progression of osteosarcoma specifically against
lung metastases dissemination.

as doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate or ifosfamide [4].
Radiotherapy is rarely used due to the radiation resistance
of this type of tumor. Many patients die from metastatic
diseases, lungs being the most common metastatic site for
osteosarcoma [5]. The lack of response to conventional
treatment in osteosarcoma patients and the poor prognosis
for the metastatic forms of the pathology underscore the
urgency to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
Alterations of bone remodeling associated with
osteosarcoma development play a central role in the
progression of this disease. Osteosarcoma is thus
characterized by abnormal osteoid bone formation

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma, the most common primary malignant
bone tumor in children and adolescents (median age of
diagnosis: 18 years) [1], represents the third highest
cause of cancer-related death in this age group [2].
The survival rate that reaches approximately 50–70%
at 5 years depending on the series have unfortunately
remained unchanged during the last few decades [3]. The
standard treatment of osteosarcoma consists of complete
surgical resection associated with neoadjuvant and
adjuvant chemotherapy composed of several agents such

and tumor-associated bone osteolysis which correlates
with poor prognosis [6] and plays a crucial role in the
establishment of a vicious cycle between the bone
and cancer cells [7]. Briefly, the tumor cells secrete
several factors able to induce, directly or indirectly the
differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts leading
to bone osteolysis [8, 9]. In turn, this osteoclastic bone
destruction allows the release of growth factors stored in
mineralized bone matrix which stimulate cancer cells and
thus the tumor growth [7–9].
One of these factors stored in the bone matrix and
released during the tumor-associated bone osteolysis
is TGF-β1, a member of the TGF-β family. Although
the role of TGF-β in cancer is complex, it is commonly
accepted that during the later stages of disease, the
TGF-β cascade promotes tumor progression mainly
by its ability to stimulate epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (in the context of carcinoma), tumor invasion,
metastatic dissemination and/or escape from the immune
system [10]. Concerning osteosarcoma, we recently
demonstrated that TGF-β1 levels are higher in the serum
of patients compared to healthy donors and that TGF-β/
Smad3 signaling pathway is activated in human biopsies.
Second, we showed that blocking the TGF-β/Smad
signaling pathway by overexpressing Smad7, a specific
Smad inhibitor, slows down the growth of the primary
tumor. This is mainly because Smad7 overexpression
in tumor cells affects the "vicious cycle" established
between tumor cells and bone cells by its ability to
decrease osteoclast activity. Importantly, we showed
that Smad7 overexpression in osteosarcoma cells or the
treatment of mice with the TβRI inhibitor SD-208 inhibits
the development of lung metastases demonstrating that
the inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway may
represent a promising therapeutic strategy against tumor
progression of osteosarcoma specifically against the
development of lung metastases [11].
Halofuginone hydrobromide, 7-bromo-6-chloro3-[3-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidinyl)-2-oxopropyl]-4(3H)quinazolinone, is a derivative alkaloid from febrifugine
isolated from a Chinese plant Dichroa febrifuga.
Halofuginone was first identified as an inhibitor of type I
collagen synthesis and is used as an anti-fibrotic drug [12].
In the context of cancer, halofuginone has recently showed
its ability to reduce Kaposi sarcoma lesions in a completed
phase II clinical trial in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi
sarcoma [13]. In addition, by using different experimental
models, halofuginone was shown to be effective against
cancer progression for example, in the case of breast
cancer [14], melanoma bone metastasis [15], myeloma
[16], pancreas [17], Wilms tumor [18], hepatocellular
carcinoma [19], bladder carcinoma [20], glioma [21] and
prostate cancer [22].
Because the effects of halofuginone against cancer
and fibrosis diseases are mainly associated with its ability

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to inhibit the TGF-β signaling pathway and because
we demonstrated that blocking TGF-β is a promising
therapeutic strategy against tumor progression of
osteosarcoma, the aim of this work was to evaluate the
effect of halofuginone on osteosarcoma progression and
metastatic development.

RESULTS
Halofuginone inhibits in vivo tumor growth
To investigate the effect of halofuginone on
osteosarcoma progression, we firstly used a mice
preclinical experimental model of osteosarcoma induced
by paratibial injection of HOS cells that mimics the
human disease. As shown in Fig. 1A, the treatment of
mice with halofuginone significantly inhibited the tumor
growth in dose dependent manner. The mean tumor size
at day 30 was 2524.3 ± 12.5 mm3, 2891.1 ± 54.5 mm3,
1949.8 ± 154.5 mm3, 1336.6 ± 50.8 mm3 and 1329.1 ±
70.1 mm3 when the mice were treated respectively with
vehicle (control group) or with 0.2 μg/day, 0.5 μg/day,
1 μg/day or 5 μg/day of halofuginone. In this context,
immunohistochemical staining for the proliferative marker
Ki67 in mice tumor samples showed that halofuginone
treatment decreases tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 1B)
during the first stage of tumor development (tumor sizes
around 500 mm3). In addition, immunohistochemical
staining for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 in the
same samples showed that the treatment of mice with
halofuginone increases tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. 1C).
Together, these results demonstrate that the
treatment of mice with halofuginone reduces in vivo
tumor growth and suggest that this effect is mainly due to
a decrease of tumor cell proliferation associated with an
increase of cell death.

Halofuginone induces in vitro cell death
To better understand the mechanisms involved
in halofuginone-induced inhibition of osteosarcoma
tumor growth, we next performed in vitro experiments.
We firstly demonstrated that halofuginone significantly
inhibits the viability of four osteosarcoma cell lines
in a dose dependent manner after 24 h incubation
(Fig. 2A). We secondly studied whether the reduced
survival of osteosarcoma cells by halofuginone was
associated with apoptosis induction. Flow cytometric
annexin V/PI assay showed that halofuginone induces an
early and late apoptotic cell populations in a dose-and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The percentage of
cells in early apoptosis (AnnexinV+/PI-) reached 0.62%
in the absence of halofuginone and reached 3.05% and
5.37% after respectively 12 h and 24 h of cell treatment
with 100 nM halofuginone. Similarly, the percentage of

cells in late apoptosis (AnnexinV+/PI+) reached 0.69%
in the absence of halofuginone and reached 1.08% and
3.82% after respectively 12 h and 24 h of treatment with
100 nM halofuginone. Thirdly, caspases-3/7 activity was
measured in HOS and U2OS cells after 24 h incubation
with halofuginone. As shown in Fig. 2C, halofuginone
stimulated caspase-3/7 activity in a dose dependent
manner. Finally, western immunoblotting analysis
demonstrated the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in a
dose dependent manner in HOS and U2OS cell lines
(Fig. 2D).
Together, these results show that halofuginone
inhibits cell viability in vitro and suggest that this effect
is mainly due to a decrease of tumor cell proliferation
possibly associated with an increase in cell death.

mice treated with 1 μg/day and  5  μg/day halofuginone
expressed significantly lower mRNA levels of RANKL
and IL-11 than control groups (Fig. 3D, upper panel).
Finally, halofuginone treatment inhibits the degradation
of collagen evaluated by the measure of pyridinoline
excretion in mice serum (Fig.  3D, lower panel) both
when tumor volumes reached 1000 mm3 (left panel) and
2500 mm3 (right panel).
Together these results demonstrate that halofuginone
both decreased tumor-induced bone osteolysis and
promoted tumor-induced bone formation, and suggest that
these effects are partly due to the ability of halofuginone
to reduce the expression of RANKL and IL-11 by
tumors cells.

Treatment of mice with halofuginone inhibits the
dissemination of pulmonary metastases

Halofuginone inhibits tumor associated
bone osteolysis

To evaluate the effect of halofuginone on
pulmonary metastases development, the lungs of mice
were removed when primary bone tumor volumes
reached 2500 mm3. As shown in Figure 4, halofuginone
reduced the incidence of lung metastases. In the absence
of halofuginone treatment, 10 mice out of 10 (100%)
developed lung metastases. By contrast, only 3 of 4 (75%)
mice treated with 0.2 μg/day  halofuginone, 2  of
4  (50%) mice treated with 0.5 μg/day halofuginone
and  4  out of 10 (40%) mice treated with 1 μg/day or
5  μg/day halofuginone developed lung metastases
(Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, the treatment of mice
with  respectively 0.2  μg/day, 0.5 μg/day, 1 μg/day and
5  μg/day halofuginone also diminished the number of
lung metastases when lungs are infected. No mice in
the 5 μg/day and 1 μg/day halofuginone treated groups
developed more than 5 lung metastases. By contrast, 8
mice in the control group developed more than 5 lung
metastases.
Together, these results prove that halofuginone
reduces both the incidence and the number of lung
metastases.

Because osteosarcoma-associated alteration of bone
remodeling plays a central role in the development and
progression of primary bone tumors, we evaluated the
ability of halofuginone to alter tumor-associated bone
remodeling. To this aim, the bone microarchitecture was
examined in mice bearing HOS tumors using a highresolution X-ray micro-CT system. First, to evaluate
the ability of halofuginone to affect the production of
bone, we specifically quantified ectopic bone formation.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the ectopic bone volume in mice
treated with 1 μg/day and 5 μg/day halofuginone was
significantly higher than in mice injected with vehicle
(1.99 ± 0.06 mm3 and 1.99 ± 0.08 mm3 vs. 0.81 ± 0.02 mm3
respectively, p < 0.005). We then analyzed the ability of
halofuginone to alter bone osteolysis by evaluating the
specific trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular
number (Tb.N) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) when
the tumor sizes reached 1000 mm3. As shown in Fig. 3B,
control mice had lower trabecular bone volume than mice
treated with 1 μg/day and 5 μg/day (6.72 ± 0.43% vs.
16.45 ± 0.68% and 12.37 ± 0.83%, p < 0.005 and p < 0.05
respectively). Moreover, control mice had a significant
lower Tb.Th than mice treated with for example 1 μg/day
halofuginone (0.095 ± 0.004 mm vs. 0.120 ± 0.002 mm,
p < 0.05). Similarly, the Tb.N was also lower in the control
group compared to the 1 μg/day halofuginone treated
group (0.75 ± 0.06 /mm vs. 1.35 ± 0.04 /mm; p < 0.005).
Similar results are observed when tumor volumes reached
around 500 mm3 (data not shown). Interestingly, systemic
treatment of mice with halofuginone does not significantly
affect bone volume in the absence of tumor (Fig. 3C). To
understand the effect of halofuginone on bone osteolysis,
we next analyzed the expression of two osteolytic
genes, RANKL and IL-11, in tumor biopsies from mice.
qRT-PCR analysis indicated that bone tumors from

Halofuginone blocks the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling
pathway in osteosarcoma cells
Because halofuginone is known to reduce TGF-β
signaling pathway in normal cells such as fibroblast
[23] and in cancer cells such as melanoma [15] and
promyelocytic leukemia [24], and because we recently
demonstrated that TGF-β signaling plays a crucial role
in the development of lung metastases in osteosarcoma,
we then evaluated the effect of halofuginone on TGF-β
signaling pathway in osteosarcoma cells. Firstly, we
demonstrated that the incubation of HOS and/or U2OS

the activation of MMP-2 in osteosarcoma cells, a
metalloproteinase that plays a crucial role in the cell
invasion process. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6B, RTqPCR analysis indicated that halofuginone inhibits the
ability of TGF-β to induce MMP-2 expression. In addition,
RT-qPCR analysis from mice biopsies indicated that the
expression by tumor cells of CXCR4 and ANGPTL4, two
TGF-β target genes identified as key players to prime
cancer cells towards the lungs, were both reduced when
mice were treated with halofuginone (Fig. 6C). Finally,
immunohistochemical staining for the endothelial marker
CD146 in mice tumor samples showed that halofuginone
treatment significantly decreased the angiogenic process
compared to the untreated group by decreasing the number
of vessels and their average size (Fig. 6D).
Together, these results prove that halofuginone
inhibits TGF-β key targets involved in the metastatic
process of osteosarcoma.

cells with halofuginone during 10 h do not affect cell
viability (Fig. 5A). In this context, to specifically evaluate
the effect of halofuginone on TGF-β signaling, we chose
to treat the cells only during 10 h, ie under experimental
conditions which do not affect osteosarcoma cell viability.
Halofuginone inhibits the ability of TGF-β to induce the
phosphorylation of Smad3 (Fig. 5B), to transactivate
the Smad3/4-specific reporter construct (CAGA)9-luc
(Fig. 5C, left panel), and to stimulate the expression of
CTGF (Fig. 5C, right panel), a specific TGF-β signaling
pathway target gene, in HOS cells. Similar results were
obtained with the U2OS cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To better understand by which mechanism halofuginone
inhibits TGF-β signaling pathway, we investigated
the effect of halofuginone on Smad7, TβRI and TβRII
expressions. As indicated in Fig. 5D, halofuginone both
induces Smad7 expression, and inhibits TβRI and TβRII
expressions even at very low doses (5 nM).
Together, these results demonstrate that
halofuginone inhibits TGF-β signaling pathway probably
by its ability to increase Smad7 expression and to reduce
the expression of the TGF-β receptors, TβRI and TβRII.

DISCUSSION
Currently a variety of agents appear to be of
potential clinical interest for osteosarcoma, with an
emphasis on molecular targeted approaches of signaling
pathways [25–28]. Basic research thus identified specific
targets and developed adapted strategies for osteosarcoma
tumor inhibition. However, many of these therapeutic
strategies focus on a single aspect of osteosarcoma
tumor development and target only one point of the
‘vicious circle’ between the tumor cells and bone
cells, either the tumor cells or the tumor environment.

Halofuginone inhibits TGF-β key targets
involved in the metastatic process
Since halofuginone is able to inhibit the TGF-β
cascade in osteosarcoma cells, we evaluated the ability
of halofuginone to inhibit TGF-β key targets involved in
the metastatic process. As shown in Fig. 6A, zymography
assay demonstrated that halofuginone strongly reduces

These strategies have thus attempted to either induce
apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest of tumor cells or to
target the tumor microenvironment by the inhibition of
osteoclast-mediated bone destruction for example. During
the last decade, new strategies have associated the use
of chemotherapeutic drugs that target tumor cells and
drugs that target osteoclasts allowing a better response
to treatment. Future directions and challenges could be
the discovery of drugs able to target several key points of
the ‘vicious circle’ established between tumor cells and
bone cells in order to limit treatment escape.
In this study, we demonstrated that halofuginone
inhibits tumor growth in human osteosarcoma xenograft
model in vivo. To understand whether the tumor growth
inhibition observed in vivo was due to the inhibition
of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, to the induction of
tumor cell apoptosis and/or to the drug effect on cell
microenvironment, we have first tested the direct potential
effect of halofuginone on osteosarcoma cell viability using
WST-1 assay. As previously described in other tumor cell
lines such as multiple myeloma or melanoma cell lines
[15, 16], we demonstrated that all the four osteosarcoma
cell lines tested are sensitive to halofuginone. In addition,
annexin V/PI double staining showed that halofuginone
induced apoptosis in a dose- and time- dependent manner.
How halofuginone modulates intracellular signaling
cascade leading to apoptosis is not fully understood.
Signaling pathways that are able to induce apoptosis
have been schematically classified into i) extrinsic
pathways initiated by death receptors and ii) intrinsic
pathways initiated by mitochondrial events [29]. Here,
we demonstrated that halofuginone induced the cleavage
and activation of caspase-3 a common mediator of both
apoptotic pathways. In addition, we demonstrated that
halofuginone induced the cleavage of PARP, a substrate
of caspase-3 known as an indicator of DNA damage and
apoptosis. Whatever the exact involvement of the intrinsic
and/or extrinsic pathways, we clearly demonstrated that
halofuginone induces in vitro and in vivo osteosarcoma
cell death and thus inhibits the in vivo tumor growth.
We next focused our attention on the effects of
halofuginone on tumor cell microenvironment, specifically
on bone remodeling. In this study, using microCT analysis,
we demonstrated that halofuginone inhibits the tumorassociated bone destruction by both promoting ectopic
bone formation and preventing trabecular bone osteolysis.
As first hypothesis, our results suggest that halofuginone
effects on bone remodeling could be explained indirectly
by the death of tumor cells induced by halofuginone.
Since some studies showed that tumor cells produce
osteoclast-activating factors which induce osteoclast
precursor differentiation and activation [30, 31], the
consequence of the decrease of the tumor cell number
may be a diminution of the production and the release
of osteolytic factors produced by tumor cells thus

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

contributing to decreased osteoclast activity. As second
hypothesis, our results suggest that halofuginone
may act on bone remodeling by its ability to block the
TGF-β signaling pathway. As previously described
in many cancer cells such as melanoma [15], we here
demonstrated that halofuginone inhibits TGF-β/Smad3
signaling pathway by increasing Smad7 expression and/
or reducing TβRI and TβRII expressions. In this context,
we demonstrated in tumor biopsies that halofuginone
inhibits the expression of RANKL and IL-11 mRNA, two
TGF-β target-cytokines that play a central role in bone
osteolysis [30–32]. In addition, we recently demonstrated
that blocking TGF-β signaling by overexpression of
Smad7 in osteosarcoma cells inhibits the expression and
release of osteolytic factors such as RANKL and IL-11 by
tumor cells [11]. Finally, although the systemic treatment
of mice with halofuginone did not show significant results
on bone remodeling in the absence of tumor, we cannot
rule out that halofuginone acts directly on osteoblast and
or osteoclast activity. Here, we clearly demonstrated that
halofuginone inhibits bone osteolysis associated to the
tumor growth, which represents the first step of tumor
development.
Finally, we have demonstrated that halofuginone
inhibits the development of lung metastases. We recently
showed that TGF-β signaling pathway plays a key role in
the establishment and progression of osteosarcoma lung
metastases. Indeed, overexpression of the Smad inhibitor
Smad7, or the systemic injection of SD208, an inhibitor
of TβRI kinase, inhibits the TGF-β signaling cascade
and thus reduces the expression of TGF-β-regulated
metastatic genes and the ability of TGF-β to stimulate
migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [11].
Here, we demonstrated that the ability of halofuginone
to inhibit the TGF-β/Smad3 cascade in osteosarcoma
reduces the expression and activity of MMP-2, a protein
highly implicated in the migration and invasion processes
[11, 33, 34]. Interestingly, halofuginone was also able to
inhibit the ability of TGF-β to stimulate ANGPTL4 and
CXCR4 expression, two factors identified as key players
to prime cancer cells for metastasis respectively towards
the lungs [35] and towards the bones or the lungs [36].
Another major step in the metastatic process is the ability
of TGF-β to stimulate tumor associated angiogenesis and
thus the dissemination of tumor cells into the bloodstream
[10]. In this context, we clearly demonstrated that
halofuginone reduces the angiogenic process as shown
by decreased immunohistochemical staining for the
endothelial marker CD146, as previously reported with
the inhibitor SD-208 [11].
To sum up, our data demonstrated that halofuginone
decreased primary osteosarcoma development and
associated lung metastases by targeting both the
tumor cells and the bone remodeling. In this context,
halofuginone represents a promising therapeutic drug

that can act at different key points of osteosarcoma
progression: on tumor cells by inducing their apoptosis, on
tumor microenvironment by inhibiting tumor associated
osteolysis and on the metastatic process mainly by
inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway.

weight loss was observed following treatment with
halofuginone. The tumor volume (V) was calculated
from the measurement of two perpendicular diameters
using a caliper, according to the following formula:
V = 0.5 × L × (S)2 as previously described [37]. Mice were
sacrificed when the tumor volume reached 2500 mm3 for
ethical considerations. Under these conditions, pulmonary
metastases developed when primary tumor volumes were
at least 2000 mm3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The human osteosarcoma cell lines MNNG/
HOS (HOS, young female high-grade osteosarcoma
from femur origin transformed in vitro by N-methylN’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
treatment),
KHOS
(derived from HOS by transformation using Kirsten
murine sarcoma virus Ki-MSV), U2OS (young female
osteosarcoma from tibia origin) and G292 (young female
osteosarcoma) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (respectively CRL-1547™, CRL1544™, HTB-96™, CRL-1423™) and cultured in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(HyclonePerbio, Bezons, France) in a humidified 5%
CO2/air atmosphere at 37°C. All cell lines were passaged
for less than 3 months and were authenticated by short
tandem repeat (STR) profiling. TGF-β1 and halofuginone
(halofuginone hydrobromide, vetranal™) were respectively
from R&D System, Inc (Minneapolis, MN) and Sigma
(St Quentin-Fallavier, France). Halofuginone has been
diluted in DPBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline,
Biowhittaker).

Histologic analysis and immunohistochemistry of
mice tumor samples
Tumor tissues were embedded in paraffin and 3-μm
sections were cut and stained for caspase-3, Ki-67 and
CD146 using respectively rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3
(Cell Signaling), anti-Ki67 (Dako), anti-CD146 (Abcam)
antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using DAB
Substrate-Chromogen (Dako) and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Quantification of relative caspase-3 positive
surface, Ki-67 positive cells and CD146 immunostaining
in tumor tissue were evaluated by ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD) softwares.

Proliferation assay
Osteosarcoma cell lines were plated in DMEM with
10% FBS and treated with halofuginone as indicated. Cell
growth and viability were determined by using a WST-1
cell proliferation assay kit (Takara bio inc.). Absorbance
of the samples was measured at 440 nm wave length with
Victor2™ (Perkin Elmer, life sciences) ELISA reader after
2 hours incubation.

Osteosarcoma mouse model
Four-week-old female Rj:NMRI-nude mice
(Elevages Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France) were
maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the
Experimental Therapy Unit (Faculty of Medicine,
Nantes, France) in accordance with the institutional
guidelines of the French Ethical Committee (CEEA
Pays de la Loire n°06; project authorization n°1281.01)
and under the supervision of authorized investigators.
The mice were anesthetized by inhalation of a
combination of isoflurane/air (1.5%, 1 L/min) before
receiving an intramuscular injection of 2.106 HOS
osteosarcoma cells in close proximity to the tibia,
leading to a rapidly growing tumor in soft tissue with
secondary contiguous bone invasion. One day after HOS
cells injection,some mice received different doses either
0.2  μg/mouse/  day (10 μg/kg/day), 0.5 μg/mouse/day
(25  μg/kg/day), 1 μg/mouse/day (50 μg/kg/day),
5 μg/mouse/day (250 μg/kg/day) of halofuginone or
control vehicle (DPBS) by daily intraperitoneal injection.
Note that the weight of each mouse was similar for
each group at the beginning of the experiment and no

Cell cycle analysis
Osteosarcoma cell lines were incubated in the
absence or the presence of halofuginone for 24 h,
trypsinized, washed twice and incubated in PBS
containing 0.12% Triton X-100, 0.12 mM EDTA and
100 μg/mL ribonuclease A; 50 μg/mL propidium iodide
was then added to each sample for 20 min at 4°C. Cell
cycle distribution was analysed by flow cytometry
(Cytomics FC500; Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France)
based on 2N and 4N DNA content.

Annexine-V assay
Osteosarcoma cells were cultured and treated
with or without halofuginone for 12 h or 24 h. Cells
were washed and resuspended in 1X binding buffer
(BD pharmingen™, BD Biosciences). Cells undergoing
apoptosis were identified by flow cytometry (Cytomics
FC500; Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France) after 20 min
incubation with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide.

per rotation step). Analysis of bone parameters were
performed using the CTan software (Skyscan). The bone
volume (BV) of ectopic bone was quantified over the
total length of tibia bearing 2500 mm3 tumor. Trabecular
structures positioned 0.2 mm below the growth plate
were quantified over a length of 1 mm at 1000 mm3
tumor volume since at higher tumor volume trabecular
bone is completely destroyed by the tumor cells.
Bone volume/trabecular volume (BV/TV), trabecular
thickness (Tb.Th) and trabecular number (Tb.N) were
determined.

Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using a
Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega). Briefly, cells were
lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris pH8, 1 mM EDTA,
150  mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS) containing
a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na2VO4), 1 mM
phenylmethylsulforyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mM
sodium fluoride (NaF), 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatine) at 4°C
and protein concentration was determined by BCA kit
(Sigma, St Quentin-Fallavier, France). An equal volume
of reagents was added to a white-walled 96-well plate
containing equal amounts of total protein extracts and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The luminescence
of each sample was measured in a plate-reading
luminometer Tristar LB941 (Berthold technologies).

Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA from cell lines was extracted using
NucleoSpin®RNAII (Macherey Nagel, Duren, Germany).
Total RNA from tumors was extracted using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) after mechanical
grinding with Turrax (IKA, Staufen, Switzerland). Total
RNA was reversed transcribed using the Maxima H minus
first stand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermoscientific). Realtime monitoring of PCR amplification of complementary
DNA was performed using DNA primers (primers
sequences are available in Table 1) on CFX96 real-time
PCR detector system (Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette,
France) with SYBR PCR Master Mix buffer (Bio-Rad).
Target gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels in respective
samples as an internal standard.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and protein
concentration was determined as described above.
Samples containing equal amounts of total protein extracts
(depending on the antibody, 30–50 μg) in Laemmli buffer
(62.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%
2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromophenol blue) were
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
and transferred to PVDF Transfer membrane (Thermo
scientific). The membranes were blocked in 3% BSA–
PBS-0.1% Tween at room temperature for 1 h and blots
were probed overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
anti-phospho-Smad3 (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA),
anti-Smad3 (Millipore), anti-PARP (Cell signaling
technology, Beverly, USA), anti-Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling
Technology) or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. After
incubation, the membranes were washed three times with
washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween) for 5 min.
Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with 1:10, 000
diluted secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies,
Santa Cruz, CA) at room temperature. Specific proteins
were detected using G-Box (Syngene, Cambridge, UK)
after washing. Antibody binding was visualized with
the enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, ThermoSientific,
Illkirch, France).

Collagen degradation
The degradation of collagen was evaluated by the
measure of pyridinoline excretion in mice serum using the
MicroVue Serum PYD EIA kit (Quidel, CA).

Transient cell transfection, reporter assay and
plasmid construct
Transient cell transfections were performed with
jetPEI™ (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France). The
phRLMLP-Renilla luciferase expression vector was
cotransfected in all experiments to monitor transfection
efficiencies. Luciferase activity was determined with
the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega,
Charbonnieres, France). The (CAGA)9-Luc construct was
used as a reporter construct specific for Smad3/4-driven
signaling.

Micro-CT analysis
Analysis of bone microarchitecture was performed
using the high-resolution X-ray micro-CT system
for small-animal imaging SkyScan-1072 (SkyScan,
Kartuizersweg, Belgium) at different tumor volumes
(500, 1000 and 2500 mm3). All tibia/fibula were
scanned using the same parameters (pixel size 18
μm, 50 kV, 0.5-mm aluminium filter and 0.6 degrees

Gelatin zymography
Cells were cultured without serum for 10 h and
their conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin
zymography in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing
1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) as described
previously [33].
