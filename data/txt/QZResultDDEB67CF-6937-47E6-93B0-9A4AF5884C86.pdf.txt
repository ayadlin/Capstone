ABSTRACT
Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is highly expressed in most breast cancers.
Consequently, ERα modulators, such as tamoxifen, are successful in breast cancer
treatment, although tamoxifen resistance is commonly observed. While tamoxifen
resistance may be caused by altered ERα signaling, the molecular mechanisms
regulating ERα signaling and tamoxifen resistance are not entirely clear. Here, we
found that PAK4 expression was consistently correlated to poor patient outcome in
endocrine treated and tamoxifen-only treated breast cancer patients. Importantly,
while PAK4 overexpression promoted tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7 human breast
cancer cells, pharmacological treatment with a group II PAK (PAK4, 5, 6) inhibitor,
GNE-2861, sensitized tamoxifen resistant MCF-7/LCC2 breast cancer cells to
tamoxifen. Mechanistically, we identified a regulatory positive feedback loop, where
ERα bound to the PAK4 gene, thereby promoting PAK4 expression, while PAK4 in
turn stabilized the ERα protein, activated ERα transcriptional activity and ERα target
gene expression. Further, PAK4 phosphorylated ERα-Ser305, a phosphorylation event
needed for the PAK4 activation of ERα-dependent transcription. In conclusion, PAK4
may be a suitable target for perturbing ERα signaling and tamoxifen resistance in
breast cancer patients.

tamoxifen resistance, including alterations in estrogen
signaling and/or crosstalk between estrogen signaling
and growth factor signaling pathways [4, 5]. In particular,
post-translational modifications of ERα, such as
phosphorylations, may play important roles in regulating
estrogen signaling thereby overcoming tamoxifen
responsiveness [6].
The PAK (p21-activated kinase) family are serine/
threonine kinases acting downstream of the small GTPases
Cdc42 and Rac with regulatory roles of cytoskeletal
dynamics [7]. PAKs are classified into Group I (PAK1-3)
and Group II (PAK4-6) based on sequence homology,
although all PAKs have an N-terminal GTPase (Rac/
Cdc42)-binding regulatory domain and a C-terminal
kinase domain [8]. Interestingly, PAKs may play
functional roles in several oncogenic events, including

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide
and the second most frequent cancer mortality in females
[1]. 70% of all breast cancers are estrogen receptor α
(ERα) positive, where ERα constitutes a driving force for
breast cancer progression [2]. ERα exerts its functions
through binding to estrogen responsive elements (EREs)
or by indirect binding to DNA through other transcription
factors, which subsequently induces the expression of
target genes [3]. ERα positive breast cancer patients often
benefit from ERα antagonist treatment. As such, tamoxifen
is the most commonly used ERα antagonist in the clinic.
Although tamoxifen largely improves breast cancer
patient survival, the development of tamoxifen-resistance
is common. Several mechanisms could contribute to

oncogenic transformation, invasion and metastasis [8].
However, the different PAK family kinases may exert
different or even opposite effects. In fact, this appears
to be the case in ERα signaling, where PAK1 and PAK6
may regulate ERα signaling in opposite directions.
While immunohistochemical staining of PAK1 in breast
cancer patient specimens was correlated to tamoxifen
resistance [9, 10], possibly related to PAK1-mediated
phosphorylation of ERα [11–14], PAK6 binds ERα
and inhibits its transcriptional activity, and this PAK6ERα interaction could be enhanced by tamoxifen [15].
Nevertheless, the possible mechanistic involvement of
PAK kinases in tamoxifen resistance remains unclear.
Interestingly, a number of findings suggest that PAK4
may be involved in cancer progression [16]. For example,
PAK4 is up-regulated in most human cancer cell lines [17],
and has also been found to be overexpressed in patient
material of several human cancer forms, including colon,
esophageal, pancreas, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer
[18–21]. Importantly, high PAK4 expression in ovary
cancer was correlated with progressing disease stage, poor
patient survival and to resistance to chemotherapy [19].
Functionally, PAK4 may play a role in transformation, since
dominant-negative PAK4 partially inhibited Ras-induced
transformation in NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts;
a constitutively active PAK4 mutant transformed NIH3T3
cells in vitro [17, 22]; and overexpression of either activated
or wild-type PAK4 made NIH3T3 cells tumorigenic in
athymic mice in vivo [21]. PAK4 may also be required
for anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells
and HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells [17, 22]. In
breast cancer cells, PAK4 inhibits cell adhesion [22–24]
and promotes cell migration by selectively inducing
αvβ5 mediated breast cancer cell motility through the
phosphorylation of the integrin β5 cytoplasmic tail and by
regulating actin depolymerisation through phosphorylation
of LIMK1 [24–28]. Moreover, PAK4 may also protect
mouse fibroblasts and HeLa cells from apoptosis by
phosphorylating BAD, a potentially tumor promoting effect
[29]. However, the potential role of PAK4 in breast cancer
remains largely elusive, for example whether PAK4 may
directly affect breast cancer related proteins such as ERα.
At the same time, there is an urgent need to find ways
to overcome tamoxifen resistance in the clinic, including the
identification of targets affecting the tamoxifen response. To
this end, the recent development of different PAK inhibitors
now facilitates the testing of their suitability for treatment of
breast cancer [30–32]. However, it is unclear which PAKs
may be suitable targets to overcome tamoxifen resistance.
Here, using two distinct gene expression databases,
each containing information from more than 1900 breast
cancer patients, we found that high PAK4 expression
consistently correlated with poor outcome for endocrine
treatment and specifically tamoxifen treated breast cancer
patients, while the expression of other PAK family
members did not consistently display such correlation in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

both databases. Mechanistically, we discovered a novel
positive feedback loop between ERα and PAK4, where
ERα binds to the PAK4 gene and induces the expression
of PAK4, and where PAK4 in turn phosphorylates ERα,
promotes ERα protein stability and its transcriptional
activity. Importantly, while overexpression of PAK4
caused decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen in MCF7
human breast cancer cells, a specific inhibitor of group
II PAKs, GNE-2861, restored the sensitivity to tamoxifen
in the tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7/LCC2 cells. Taken
together, PAK4 appears as an interesting target to explore
for the restoration of tamoxifen sensitivity in breast
cancer.

RESULTS
Association between PAK4 gene expression and
clinical outcome among tamoxifen treated breast
cancer patients
The potential prognostic role of PAK family
members in endocrine therapy-treated patients was
explored in two large public breast cancer datasets,
Metabric and KMplot [33, 34], where we assessed two
related end-points, disease-free survival and relapse-free
survival, respectively, since identical endpoints were
not available. We found that high PAK4 expression was
associated with poor disease-specific survival among
the 915 Metabric ERα positive endocrine therapytreated patients in a univariable model (Figure 1A, HR
= 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03–1.74). In the Metabric database,
while endocrine treated patients can be identified, no
information is available in terms of the specific endocrine
treatment. However, in the KMplot breast cancer database,
we were able to analyze a tamoxifen-only treated patient
group. In the selected KMplot populations of 725 ERα
positive patients treated only with endocrine therapy as
systemic adjuvant treatment (“endocrine therapy only”),
high PAK4 expression was also associated with poor
prognosis (Figure 1B, HR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.15–2.08).
Most patients in the endocrine treated group received
tamoxifen. Importantly, also among cases with tamoxifen
as the only systemic adjuvant treatment (“tamoxifenonly”) (n = 650), high PAK4 expression was correlated
to poor relapse-free survival (Figure 1C, HR = 1.79; 95%
CI: 1.20–2.67) in a univariable model for relapse-free
survival. The patient outcome in tamoxifen-only treated
group in relation to PAK4 expression was consistent with
that of the endocrine treated patients in both the Metabric
and the KMplot datasets. However, while high PAK2 and
PAK6 expression correlated with relapse-free survival in
the KMplot dataset, no such correlation was detectable in
the Metabric dataset (Supplementary Figure S1 and S2).
Thus, no consistent correlation was detected between the
expression of PAK family members other than PAK4

(PAK1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and the patient outcome of endocrine
treated breast cancer patients in the two databases.
The correlation between high PAK4 expression
and unfavorable endocrine treated breast cancer patient
outcome is consistent with a potential role for PAK4 in
tamoxifen resistance. This motivated us to further examine
such a potential role for PAK4.

where GNE-2861 restored the tamoxifen sensitivity to a
similar level as in untreated tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 maternal cells (Figure 2B–2C). As shown in Figure
2B–2C, the approximate IC50 of tamoxifen in MCF-7/
Control and MCF7/LCC2 cells are 7 μM and 14 μM,
respectively. By keeping the tamoxifen concentration
constant at the approximate IC50 for each cell line and
varying the concentration of GNE-2861, we found that
tamoxifen sensitized breast cancer cells to GNE-2861
treatment (Figure 2D–2E). Together, this indicates that
PAK4 contributes to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer
cells and may be used as a target to restore tamoxifen
sensitivity. Further, this indicates that the group II
PAK inhibitor GNE-2861 may be a candidate for the
development of tamoxifen-sensitizing pharmacological
treatment.

Pharmacological targeting of group II PAKs
restores tamoxifen sensititvity in human
breast cancer cells
Based on the prognostic role of PAK4 in endocrine
treated and tamoxifen-only treated breast cancer
patients, we examined if PAK4 may affect the tamoxifen
response in human breast cancer cells. As shown in
Figure 2A, stable overexpression of PAK4 significantly
decreased the tamoxifen sensitivity in human MCF-7
breast cancer cells (Figure 2A). It can be noted that low
concentration of tamoxifen promoted cell proliferation,
consistent with the well-established estrogen-like effect
of low tamoxifen concentrations [35]. Interestingly, a
recently developed small organic compound, GNE-2861
(Compound 17), specifically inhibits group II PAKs
(PAK4, 5, 6), but not group I PAKs (PAK1, 2, 3) [31],
thereby facilitating pharmacological targeting of group
II PAKs in cells. We selected this inhibitor because it
displays the most impressive specificity profile among
known PAK4-inhibitors [30, 31, 36]. Importantly, GNE2861 enhanced the tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7
cells (Figure 2B), as well as in the tamoxifen-resistant
human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/LCC2 [37, 38]

PAK4 is a direct ERα target gene
The clinical correlation between PAK4 and
endocrine treated breast cancer patient outcome
together with the functional role of PAK4 in tamoxifen
response suggest that there may be a regulatory
relationship between PAK4 and ERα. To elucidate
this potential relationship, we treated MCF-7 cells
with 10 nM 17β-estradiol (E2), a natural ligand of
ERα. Interestingly, E2 treatment increased both
PAK4 mRNA and protein levels in a time dependent
manner (Figure 3A and 3B). Also, our results (Figure
3B) are consistent with the well-known phenomena
that E2 treatment significantly reduces ERα protein
levels [39]. In addition, analysis of the ERα genomic

DNA-binding profile in MCF-7 cells by chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIPseq) revealed two ERα binding sites within intron
1 of the PAK4 gene (Figure 3C). The data have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (Zhuang
et al., 2015) and are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE73320 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73320). These two
binding sites were also observed in other published ERα
cistromes [40, 41] and one of the binding sites was also
found to be present in the ERα cistrome of 1,234 binding
sites identified by Lin and colleagues [42]. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR
(ChIP-qPCR) validated the binding of ERα to these two
regions (Figure 3D), an interaction that was increased
by E2 treatment. Together, this indicates a regulatory
role for ERα signaling on PAK4 expression via direct
ERα binding to the PAK4 gene. Interestingly, analysis
of data from ER+ breast cancer patients in the Metabric
database shows a positive correlation between ESR1 and
PAK4 gene expression (Figure 3E), which is consistent
with an ERα regulation of the PAK4 gene in breast
cancer.
Interestingly, we found that tamoxifen induced
PAK4 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3F). To
avoid off-target effects of tamoxifen, 1 μm tamoxifen was
used to treat MCF-7 cells for 12 h. The ERα downstream
target gene, IL-20, was used as a positive control for the
tamoxifen treatment. The tamoxifen mediated increase
in PAK4 expression may allow PAK4 to influence the
tamoxifen response.

E2 stimulation (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S4).
These results indicate that PAK4 strongly modulates ERα
signaling and ERα-regulated cell proliferation.

PAK4 regulates ERα protein stability
As shown in Figure 4A, PAK4 inhibition in MCF7 cells caused decreased ERα protein levels. Further,
ERα mRNA levels were also detected. However, siRNAmediated PAK4 knock-down did not affect ERα mRNA
levels (Figure 5A). Further, transfection of increasing
amounts of a PAK4 expression plasmid caused a gradual
increase of ERα protein (Figure 5B). ERα protein stability
was then analyzed by measuring ERα protein levels at
different time points after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment.
Importantly, ERα regulates its own mRNA expression
in MCF-7 cells, making it difficult to distinguish direct
effects of PAK4 on ERα protein levels in this cell line
[43]. We therefore performed assays in HEK-293 cells,
in which ERα is not expressed. PAK4 overexpression
significantly increased exogenous ERα protein half-life
in HEK293 cells (Figure 5C). In addition, cells were
treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which
reduces degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in
mammalian cells. Interestingly, PAK4 overexpression
could not further enhance the ERα protein level when ERα
proteasomal degradation was inhibited by MG132 (Figure
5D) suggesting that PAK4 overexpression may prevent
proteasomal degradation of ERα. Together, our data shows
that PAK4 controls ERα signaling via regulation of its
protein stability.

PAK4-inhibition decreases ERα protein levels,
ERα signaling and E2-mediated cell proliferation

PAK4 regulates ERα signaling through
phosphorylation of ERα Serine-305

While ERα signaling regulated PAK4 expression,
we also wanted to find out if PAK4 may regulate ERα
signaling. Specifically, in the light of group II PAKinhibition leading to ERα antagonist (tamoxifen)
sensitization, we firstly analyzed the potential of PAK4inhibition on ERα signaling. To this end, siRNA-mediated
knock-down of PAK4 as well as the GNE-2861 compound
caused decreased ERα protein levels in both MCF-7 and
T47D human breast cancer cell lines (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure S3A). In order to further elucidate
the effect of PAK4 perturbation on ERα transcriptional
activity, we performed an estrogen response element
(ERE) luciferase assay. Interestingly, PAK4 inhibition by
either siRNA or the GNE-2861 compound decreased ERE
luciferase activity upon E2 treatment in both MCF-7 and
T47D cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S3B).
In line with this, PAK4 inhibition also decreased ERα
target gene expression, including ADORA1, Cyclin D1,
EGR3, GREB1, IL-20, PDZK1, PKIB, and PS2, both with
and without E2 treatment (Figure 4C). Block of PAK4
also significantly decreased EdU incorporation in MCF7 breast cancer cells both in the presence and absence of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Given that PAK4 is a kinase, we examined if PAK4
may directly phosphorylate ERα and thereby affect ERα
signaling. First, we expressed and purified fragments
of ERα (aa 1–250; aa 251–420; aa 421–595) as GSTfusion proteins (Figure 6A), and performed an in vitro
kinase assay using purified recombinant PAK4 together
with the ERα protein fragments. Interestingly, we found
PAK4-mediated phosphorylation of the ERα fragment
aa 251–420; while none of the other parts of ERα were
phosphorylated (Figure 6B). In order to identify the
specific phosphorylation site(s), the possible threonine
and serine phosphorylation sites in ERα aa 251–420 were
identified according to the PhosphoSitePlus online tool
(http://www.phosphosite.org, accessed on May 2014) [44],
revealing four such putative Ser/Thr kinase target sites
(Figure 6A). Each of these four Ser/Thr was separately
mutated into Alanines and tested for the effect of the Alamutation in terms of PAK4-mediated phosphorylation.
As shown in Figure 6C, while three of these mutations
had no effect on PAK4-mediated phosphorylation of
ERα aa 251–420; the ERα-S305A mutation abolished

PAK4-mediated ERα-phosphorylation. Thus, Ser305 was
identified as the PAK4-mediated ERα-phosphorylation
site. To test if PAK4-mediated phosphorylation of ERαSer305 had any effect on ERα signaling within cells, we
examined the ERα response in an ERE luciferase assay in
the presence or absence of E2. Importantly, while PAK4

increased the estrogen response by wild type Flag-ERα,
the Flag-ERα-S305A mutant failed to respond to PAK4
even in the presence of E2 (Figure 6D). This suggests
that PAK4 regulates ERα signaling through the direct

Flag-ERα and Flag-ERα-S305A were overexpressed
in HEK293 cells and the stability was determined after
CHX treatment. Interestingly, Flag-ERα-S305A displayed
a lower stability than wild-type Flag-ERα (Figure 6E).
As shown in Figure 6F, Flag-ERα-S305A was also more
strongly ubiquitinated than wild-type Flag-ERα, which
is consistent with a more repid proteasome-mediated
degradation of the Flag-ERα-S305A mutant.

outcome. However, while the correlation of high PAK4
expression and poor patient outcome is consistent with a
functional role in tamoxifen resistance, it should be noted
that the PAK kinases are regulated also at the level of
kinase activity. Unfortunately, there is at present no good
marker for PAK activity that can be traced in patient
materials and therefore, it remains unclear if the activity
of any of the PAKs may be correlated with disease
outcome. Also, in relation to the PAK4 expression level
correlation with patient outcome, it should be noted that
PAK4 in breast cancer may play other or additional roles
to tamoxifen resistance that may influence that patient
outcome. Nevertheless, our experimental data indicate
that PAK4 may be a suitable pharmacological target for
the development of therapy to sensitize breast cancer to
tamoxifen treatment.
In addition, we here showed that ERα binds
to the PAK4 gene and promotes PAK4 transcription
upon E2 treatment, while the increased PAK4 in turn
phosphorylates and stabilizes the ERα protein, thereby
enhancing ERα signaling and transcription of ERα target
genes, including PAK4. This positive feed-forward loop
may also promote breast cancer cell proliferation and
tamoxifen resistance. So far, PAK4 is the only PAK
family member found to be a transcriptional target of
ERα. Together, our data indicate that PAK4 may have an
unusually tight relationship with ERα signaling.
A related mechanism for tamoxifen resistance is
through the loss of expression of Rho guanine dissociation
inhibitor α (RhoGDIα), a negative regulator of the Rho
family proteins Rho, Rac-1 and Cdc42 [11]. Consequently,
loss of RhoGDIα caused increased Rho, Rac-1 and
Cdc42 activities in breast cancer cells [11]. Given that
PAK1 can act downstream of Rac-1 and Cdc42, Barone
et al. proposed that PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of
ERα-Ser305 was coupled to the RhoGDIα-regulation
of tamoxifen resistance [11]. However, the possible
functional involvement of Rho, Rac-1, Cdc42, or PAK1 in
the RhoGDIα control of tamoxifen resistance has not been
experimentally addressed. In this context, it may be noted
that all the six PAK family members are downstream
effectors of Rac-1 and Cdc42 [52, 53]. This means that
our finding of a role for PAK4 in tamoxifen resistance and
in regulating ERα signaling through the phosphorylation
of Ser-305 may suggest that PAK4 activation could
potentially act down-stream of loss of RhoGDIα in
induction of tamoxifen resistance.
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in
using PAK family kinases as targets in cancer [8, 16].
To this end, the group I p21-activated kinase inhibitor
FRAX1036, in combination with taxane, induced
apoptosis in luminal breast cancer cells [32]. Here we
showed that GNE-2861, a small molecule selectively
inhibiting group II PAKs, but with no effect on group I
PAKs [31], overcomes tamoxifen resistance. Given that
PAK4 overexpression promoted tamoxifen resistance,

DISCUSSION
Tamoxifen resistance is a significant clinical
problem in breast cancer, causing tumor relapse and
progression [45]. However, the mechanism for tamoxifen
resistance is not entirely clear, although multiple
pathways have been implicated in the presumably diverse
mechanisms responsible for tamoxifen resistance, such
as estrogen signaling pathways, cell cycle signaling
pathways and growth factor receptor pathways [46].
Either loss of ERα function or increased function (or loss
of control) can be associated with tamoxifen resistance.
The phosphorylation of ERα Ser305 results in activation
of ERα, which could render estrogen-hypersensitivity
and antiestrogen-insensitivity [13, 47]. In fact,
experimental and clinical data suggest that ERα Ser305
phosphorylation may promote tamoxifen resistance in
breast cancer [12–14, 47–49]. One possible mechanism
for the ERα Ser305 phosphorylation in tamoxifen
resistance is an altered orientation between ERα and its
coactivator SRC-1, which elevates the ERα transcription
activity in the presence of tamoxifen [47, 48]. Moreover,
phosphorylation of ERα Ser305 by PAK1 can trigger a
secondary phosphorylation on Ser118, which may also
contribute to tamoxifen resistance [13]. Our finding
that the group II PAK inhibitor GNE-2861, which does
not inhibit group I PAKs (PAK1, 2, 3) [31], restored
tamoxifen sensitivity, in combination with the induction
of tamoxifen resistance by PAK4 overexpression and the
correlation of high PAK4 expression with poor patient
outcome after tamoxifen treatment now suggest that
PAK4 may promote tamoxifen resistance in ERα positive
breast cancer. Our identification of PAK4-mediated
phosphorylation of ERα-Ser305 is particularly interesting
in the light of the previous correlation between ERαSer305-phosphorylation and tamoxifen-resistance in
breast cancer patients [49]. However, given that ERα
Ser305 phosphorylation can be mediated by at least also
PAK1, a group I PAK member [49, 50], and by PKA
[47, 48, 51], the relative importance of these kinases
in breast cancer remains unclear, considering also that
both PAK1 and PAK4 have been found overexpressed
in human breast cancer [10, 21]. However, while high
PAK4 expression displayed consistent correlation with
poor outcome of endocrine treated breast cancer patients
in two distinct large databases, no other PAK member
displayed such a consistent correlation with the patient

and that PAK4 displayed the only consistent correlation
in both databases among group II PAKs to breast cancer
patient outcome, and that depletion of PAK4 by siRNA
gave very similar effects on ERα signaling as GNE2861, this suggests that GNE-2861 may act to restore
tamoxifen sensitivity by the inhibition of PAK4,
although we cannot exclude possible effects onto other
targets.

and then treated with 10 nM E2 or vehicle for another
24 h. Alternatively, cells were treated with GNE-2861
together with 10 nM E2 or vehicle for 24 h.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mammalian cell expression constructs

Immunoblotting

The ERα plasmid and Flag-ERα plasmid was
described previously [54]. A Flag-ERα-S305A mutant
was generated using the Flag-ERα and the QuickChange
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (200518-5, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The Flag-PAK4 plasmid
was described in previous studies [22, 24].

Cells were lysed with NP-40 cell lysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% NP-40), with freshly added
Protease inhibitor (11697498001, Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
20 μg of cell lysate was loaded into each well for SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and was
electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (10600008,
GE healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Membranes were
incubated with antibodies against β-Actin (A5316) from
Sigma (Saint Louis, USA); c-myc (SC40) from Santa Cruz
(Dallas, USA); ERα (SC543) from Santa Cruz (Dallas,
USA); Flag (F3165) from Sigma (Saint Louis, USA); GFP
(MAB2510) from Millipore (Temecula, USA); ubiquitin
(FL76) from Santa Cruz (Dallas, USA); PAK4 (total) pAb
(6508) generated in our laboratory [25].

Cell culture and transient transfections
DMEM (41965-039, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was
used to culture MCF-7 (purchased from ATCC), MCF-7/
Control (kindly provided by Dr. Janne Lehtiö), MCF-7/
LCC2 (kindly provided by Dr. Janne Lehtiö), HEK293
(purchased from ATCC) and COS-7 cells (purchased
from ATCC). RPMI-1640 (42401-018, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, was
used to culture T47D (purchased from ATCC) cells. Phenol
red-free DMEM (11880-028, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, USA), supplemented with 5% DCC-FCS serum
(12676029, Life Technologies, Grand Island, USA) was
utilized for all the experiments involving 17β-estradiol
(E2) treatment. MCF-7 cells with Flag-BAP (bacterial
alkaline phosphatase) or Flag-PAK4 stable expression
were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% FBS and 150 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) [25]. All cells
were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5%
CO2. Transient transfections of plasmids were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol: 8 μg of total
DNA was transfected for each 100-mm cell culture dish
(90% cell confluence) using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668027, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA, USA).

RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) analysis
RNeasy kits were utilized for RNA extraction
(74104, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was
performed using standard procedures, using TaqMan
Reverse Transcription Reagents (N808-0234, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA). qPCR experimental
procedures were previously described [55]. qPCR
was performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with FastStart
Universal SYBR Green Master mix (04913914001,
Roche, Indianapolis, USA) according to conditions
specified by the manufacturer. The 36B4 gene was used as
an internal control for normalization. Primer sequences for
qPCR are shown in more detail (Supplementary Table S1).
The specificity of all primer pairs was checked by melting
curve analysis.

Technologies, Grand Island, USA), supplemented with
5% DCC-FCS serum (12676029, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, USA). Cells were treated with vehicle or
10 nM E2 for 45 min and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed as previously described [56], using
anti-ERα antibody HC-20 (Santa Cruz, CA) or normal
rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitated
DNA was assessed by qPCR. Primer sequences used
for qPCR are given in more detail (Supplementary
Table S1). ChIP-Seq was performed using the Illumina
Genome Analyzer following the Manufacturer’s
protocols. The raw sequencing image data were analyzed
by the Illumina analysis pipeline, mapped to the human
reference genome (hg19, GRCh37) using Bowtie.
Significantly enriched ERα binding regions, comparing
to IgG control were identified using the Partek Genomics
Suite (Partek® software. Copyright, Partek Inc., St Louis,

ERα fragments corresponding to amino acid (aa)
1-250; aa 251-420; aa 421-595 and the mutants ERα aa
251-420-S282A; aa 251-420-S294A; aa 251-420-S305A
and aa 251-420-T311A were individually expressed
as GST-fusion proteins using the bacterial expression
vector pGEX-4t-1 (27-1542-01, GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden). GST-fusion proteins were purified using
glutathione-Sepharose beads (17-0756-01, GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) according to the Manufacturer’s
protocol. His-PAK4 fusion protein was produced
as described [26]. In vitro protein phosphorylation
assays were performed as described [26]. Briefly, ERα
phosphorylation was determined in a kinase reaction buffer
(50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2
mM dithiothreitol) in the presence of 30 μM ATP and 10
μCi of [γ-32P] ATP and in the presence of the kinase (5 μg
of His-PAK4) and 5 μg of the substrate (GST, GST-Raf1aa332-344, or GST-ERα fragments) for 30 min at 30°C.
The reaction was stopped by adding sample loading buffer
and heating at 95°C for 5 min. Samples were separated by
10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography with
the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Imager FX, BioRad).

Flow cytometry
EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) labeled DNA
staining was performed according to the Manufacturer’s
protocol (C10424, Life Technologies, Eugene, USA)
as described in a previous study [57]. 10 μM EdU was
added for 1 h before fixation by ice-cold Ethanol (final
concentration 70%). The BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD
Bioscience) was used to measure the DNA incorporation
signal and fluorescence was measured in the FL-4
channel.

Ubiquitination assays
HEK-293 cells were transfected with wild-type
Flag-ERα or Flag-ERα-S305A. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 for 8
h. Ubiquitin was detected by immunoblotting.

ERE luciferase assays
Cells were co-transfected with ERE/Luci (firefly
luciferase) and phRL/CMV (Renilla luciferase) plasmids.
Luciferase activity was measured using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega,
Mannheim, Germany).

Public datasets
Two publicly available databases were used to
explore the prognostic role of PAK4 gene expression
in ERα positive clinical samples. The KMplot online
tool (http://www.kmplot.com, accessed on April 2015)
assembled gene expression data from Affymetrix
platforms of different breast cancer cohorts and allows
Kaplan-Meier analysis of selected genes [34]. On the
KMplot platform, ERα positive patients having received
only endocrine therapy (n = 725) or more specifically,
only tamoxifen (n = 650) as adjuvant treatment were
selected. All annotated Affymetrix probesets with a quality
estimated as Jetset best probesets for each of the gene in
the A arrays were analyzed [58]. For each member of the
PAK family, we used the latest version of the hgu133a.
db Bioconductor package (version 3.1.3) as annotation. In
case of multiple probesets per gene, the optimal probeset
according to the Jetset method was selected for further
analysis [58] (Supplementary Table S2). The selected
probesets for PAKs are as following: PAK1 209615_s_at;
PAK2 208877_at; PAK3 214607_at; PAK4 203154_s_at;
PAK5 210721_s_at; PAK6 219461_at. The Metabric

WST-1 cell proliferation assay
104 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well
plates. 1 h before reading the plate, WST-1 reagent
(11644807001, Roche, Indianapolis, USA) (1:10 diluted
by cell culture medium) was added to each well. The
absorbance of the samples was measured against a
blank background control using a microplate reader at
450 nm.

Protein stability assay
Cells were treated with 100 μM cycloheximide
(CHX) (C4859, Sigma) for different times or 10 μM
MG132 (SC-201270, Santa Cruz) for 8 h. ERα protein
levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. Quantification
of immunoblotted bands (X-ray film blackening) was
performed by ImageJ.

gene expression normalized data were downloaded from
the European genome-phenome archive platform (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000083, accessed
on March 2015). Metabric used the Illumina HT-12 v3
platform for transcriptional profiling of 1992 breast cancer
tumor patients [33]. Clinical variables were obtained from
the supplementary material of the original publication
[33]. No information was given in the Metabric cohort
concerning the type of administered endocrine therapy.
915 ERα positive endocrine therapy treated patients were
available in this cohort. The probe for each PAK gene that
displays the highest interquartile range was used for the
patient outcome analysis (Supplementary Table S3). For
two of the PAK genes, more than one probe was available.
The ILMN_1712687 probe was selected for PAK2 and the
ILMN_1728887 probe was selected for PAK4, since they
display the highest interquartile range.

Statistics
The prognostic role of PAK4 in ERα positive
endocrine therapy and tamoxifen treated patients was
explored for the Relapse Free Survival (KMplot) and
Disease Specific Survival (Metabric) endpoints. Deaths
of an unknown cause were excluded from analyses of the
Disease Specific Survival endpoint. PAK4 gene expression
was dichotomized according to an auto-selected best cutoff (KMplot) or by median-based cut-off (Metabric). The
univariable prognostic role of PAK4 (above vs. below the
cut-off) was visualized using Kaplan-Meier estimates and
compared using log-rank test. All analyses of the Metabric
cohort were stratified by site, which is suggested in the
original publication [33]. Similar methods were used for
all other PAK family genes. The analysis was exploratory
and therefore, no multiple testing correction was applied.
Spearman correlation analysis was used to calculate the
correlation between the expression of the PAK4 and
ESR1 genes in the Metabric dataset. Statistical analyses
of disease outcome were performed using the KMplot
platform and the R statistical software v3.1.0. Two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (two-sample KS-test) was used
for immunoblot quantifications of the CHX experiment.
Cox regression analysis and t-test were utilized for other
statistical analyses. P < 0.05 was considered to represent
statistical discernibility of differences.
