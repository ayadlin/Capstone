The cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/retinoblastoma (RB)-axis is a critical modulator of cell cycle entry and is aberrant in many
human cancers. New nodes of therapeutic intervention are needed that can delay or combat the onset of malignancies. The
antitumor properties and mechanistic functions of PD-0332991 (PD; a potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitor) were investigated
using human prostate cancer (PCa) models and primary tumors. PD signiﬁcantly impaired the capacity of PCa cells to proliferate by
promoting a robust G1-arrest. Accordingly, key regulators of the G1-S cell cycle transition were modulated including G1 cyclins D, E
and A. Subsequent investigation demonstrated the ability of PD to function in the presence of existing hormone-based regimens
and to cooperate with ionizing radiation to further suppress cellular growth. Importantly, it was determined that PD is a critical
mediator of PD action. The anti-proliferative impact of CDK4/6 inhibition was revealed through reduced proliferation and delayed
growth using PCa cell xenografts. Finally, ﬁrst-in-ﬁeld effects of PD on proliferation were observed in primary human prostatectomy
tumor tissue explants. This study shows that selective CDK4/6 inhibition, using PD either as a single-agent or in combination,
hinders key proliferative pathways necessary for disease progression and that RB status is a critical prognostic determinant for
therapeutic efﬁcacy. Combined, these pre-clinical ﬁndings identify selective targeting of CDK4/6 as a bona ﬁde therapeutic target in
both early stage and advanced PCa and underscore the beneﬁt of personalized medicine to enhance treatment response.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer mortality in men
and presents an ongoing therapeutic challenge.1 PCa is one of the
most prevalent cancers diagnosed in men with a lifetime risk of
1-in-6 according to the American Cancer Society. Localized disease
can be effectively managed through surgery and/or radiation;1,2
however, advanced disease represents a major clinical challenge
as standard chemotherapeutics are not typically effective.1
Treatment for advanced PCa is based primarily on its
dependence of the androgen receptor (AR) for development,
growth and survival. Therefore, the mainstay of treatment for
advanced disease involves androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs)
that result in cell cycle arrest and/or death.1 These ablative
therapies are effective on average for 2–3 years, whereupon lethal
castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) develops, because of re-activation
of AR signaling.1 Despite recent progress, the ability to effectively
treat CRPC remains limited; therefore, additional therapeutic
options are needed.
Owing to the importance of androgen signaling, PCa at all
stages remains reliant on AR to promote growth and/or survival.1
AR is a nuclear hormone receptor and upon activation by
androgens (for example, dihydrotestosterone, (DHT)) induces a
complex transcriptional program that includes proliferation and
expression of prostate-speciﬁc genes such as kallikrein-related
peptidase 3 (KLK3) (prostate-speciﬁc antigen, PSA). As an AR-target,
KLK3/PSA is not only used as a surrogate for AR activity, but is also
used in the clinical setting to monitor disease.1 Treatment of

advanced PCa entails limiting AR activity either through inhibiting
androgen levels or through the use of direct AR antagonists like
bicalutamide.1 Recurrent disease invariably ensues as a result of
re-activated AR, indicated by resurgent KLK3/PSA. Multiple
mechanisms have been described to explain restored AR activity
including: ampliﬁcation, activating mutations or splice variants,
altered post-translational modiﬁcations, aberrant expression of
cofactors, and intracrine androgen synthesis.1 Regardless of the
mechanism of restoration, AR continues to promote proliferation
in advanced disease. Thus, a concerted effort has been
undertaken to determine how AR governs cell cycle progression
in order to target the cell cycle machinery and improve therapy.
The mechanism by which androgen/AR induces the cell cycle to
instigate proliferation has been recently reviewed.3 Brieﬂy,
androgen promotes enhanced translation, through mammalian
target of rapamycin, of the D-type cyclins and the induction of
p21Cip1 mRNA. These inductive events combine to assist the
formation of an active complex between D-cyclins, p21Cip1 and the
cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) that are important for cell
cycle progression. The combined kinase functions of early G1
cyclin-D/CDK4 or 6 and late G1 cyclin-E/CDK2 serve to
phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (RB), allowing E2F
transcription factors to control downstream cyclin expression
(for example, cyclin A) required for S-phase transition. Given the
importance of the cyclin/CDK/RB-axis in controlling the G1-S
transition in the majority of cancers, including PCa, a prime

therapeutic candidate has been CDK activity.4–7 In PCa, the
majority of early pre-clinical studies designed to modulate CDK
activity with ﬂavopiridol, a pan-CDK inhibitor, showed antitumor
activity in xenografts.8–10 However, enthusiasm waned as phase II
clinical trials of ﬂavopiridol were disappointing, due largely to offtarget effects and toxicity.11 Recently, a clinical grade, orally active
CDK inhibitor (PD-0332991, PD) has been developed that
selectively and reversibly inhibits CDK4/6 at low nanomolar
concentrations.12,13 Pre-clinical studies in other cancer models
have shown that PD induces a robust cytostatic G1-arrest, delays
or prevents xenograft formation with minimal cell death, and may
hinder metastatic potential. PD has been shown preliminarily to
limit disease progression in patients with inoperable RB-positive
teratomas, which are commonly resistant to chemo- and radiation
therapy, with minimal adverse events.14 Importantly, clinical trials
have been initiated based on pre-clinical data from both
hematological and solid tumors (for example, lymphoma,15
leukemia,16,17 myeloma18,19, breast,20–25 colon,26–28 lung,29
esophageal30 and glioblastoma31,32).
Currently, no study has assessed the efﬁcacy of PD in PCa,
despite the preliminary pre-clinical analyses and few recently
completed phase I trials.33–35 Here, a pre-clinical evaluation of PD
was undertaken to determine its therapeutic potential in PCa.
Using well-established hormone-dependent and CRPC cell
models, PD showed remarkable single-agent activity with regard
to limiting cellular proliferation and growth. Subsequent analyses
demonstrated the feasibility of combinatorial therapy between PD
and existing treatments such as AR antagonists and radiation. The
potential therapeutic effect of PD was revealed using both in vivo
mouse xenografts and a recently developed novel ex vivo assay
using primary human tumors obtained by radical prostatectomy.
These pre-clinical ﬁndings, using PD, suggest selective CDK4/6
inhibition as a potential node of intervention in PCa, and warrant
future studies to evaluate its clinical efﬁcacy.

RESULTS
PCa cell proliferation is attenuated by CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition
PD, a CDK 4/6-selective inhibitor, was evaluated in a comprehensive panel of hormone-sensitive PCa cells. Dose dependence
studies for PD indicated an IC50 range of 44–91 nM (Supplementary
Figure 1A) consistent with other hormone-dependent cancer cell
systems.20,36,37 PCa cells were treated with PD (B5–10X the IC50)
and assessed for active proliferation via pulse labeling with
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry
(Figure 1a). As shown, BrdU incorporation in LNCaP, LAPC4 and
VCaP cells was profoundly attenuated (treated vs control (%): 4.27
vs 23.1, 2.93 vs 28.5 and 2.32 vs 23.2, respectively). Cell cycle
analyses revealed a strong G0/G1-phase arrest (data not shown)
consistent with suppression of CDK4/6 activity.5 VCaP cells treated
with PD, which showed the strongest anti-proliferative response,
displayed minimal cell death as indicated by sub-G1 accumulation
(Supplementary Figure 1B) and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) (Supplementary Figure 1C) as compared with
etoposide. Similarly, PD had minimal impact on extracellular
signal-regulated kinase signaling (Supplementary Figure 1D). In
addition, treatment of PD conferred a reduction in cell growth as
indicated by crystal violet staining (Figure 1b). As the cyclin/CDK/
RB pathway is implicated in oncogenic signaling in cancer,38
protein expression of cell cycle components was monitored after
PD treatment (Figure 1c). In all cells tested, protein levels of CDK4
and AR were unchanged by PD. In contrast, RB protein Ser780phosphorylation, a known site of CDK4/6 activity,38 was
suppressed. Cyclin A, a well-characterized RB target gene and
positive indicator of proliferation,38,39 levels were attenuated by
PD. Combined, the decreased RB phosphorylation and cyclin A
protein levels strongly indicated that PD effectively inhibited

CDK4/6 activity. Examination of the protein levels of key G1-cyclins
(cyclins D1 and E), required for the activation of CDKs (CDK4/6 and
CDK2, respectively), revealed disparate and cell-speciﬁc changes on
PD exposure. Cyclin E1 was unchanged or decreased only in LAPC4
cells, whereas cyclin D1 was modestly but signiﬁcantly increased in
LNCaP and LAPC4 but not VCaP cells. Elevated cyclin D1 was
somewhat surprising, as many therapeutics that suppress
proliferation and induce G1-arrest are frequently associated with
loss of cyclin D1.40 As cyclin D1 binds and initiates CDK4/6
activity,38,41,42 co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed
(Supplementary Figure 1E) to determine if PD altered the cyclin D1–
CDK4 complex. Immunoprecipitation of CDK4 from PD-treated
LNCaP cells resulted in a modest increase in co-immunoprecipitated cyclin D1 (compare lanes 2 and 5), suggesting that PD may
stabilize an inactive cyclin D1–CDK4 complex and hinder the
turnover of cyclin D1. Combined, these data indicate that PD
inhibits CDK4/6-dependent phosphorylation of RB resulting in
suppression of proliferation/growth in multiple hormone-sensitive
PCa cells.
Efﬁcacy of AR-directed therapeutics is retained in combination
with CDK4/6 inhibition
Virtually all stages of PCa are dependent on androgen/AR
signaling.1 Consequently, advanced PCa is treated with
hormone-based therapies that block AR signaling.1 It has been
shown that aberrant cyclin D1 levels can selectively modulate
androgen-dependent AR activity.43 Therefore, the impact of PD on
androgen-dependent AR activity and/or potential response to ARdirected therapies (i.e., casodex, Csdx) was assessed via gene
expression analyses of AR-target genes (KLK3/PSA, TMPRSS2 and
KLK2) with known clinical relevance (Figure 2). To measure
androgen/AR-dependent target gene expression, LNCaP
(Figure 2a), LAPC4 (Figure 2b) and VCaP (Figure 2c) cells were
cultured in steroid hormone-depleted (charcoal dextran-treated
serum) media, then stimulated with DHT in the presence of the AR
antagonist Csdx, PD or a combination thereof. As expected, DHT
resulted in a robust increase in the mRNA expression of all ARtarget genes. Conversely, Csdx signiﬁcantly reduced DHT-induced
AR-target gene expression. Addition of PD (or in combination with
Csdx) had no impact on DHT-induced gene expression in VCaP
cells and had minimal cooperative impact in LNCaP and LAPC4
cells, consistent with the established observation that cyclin D1
modulates AR activity independent of CDK function. These data
indicate that PD acts in a manner distinct from AR-directed
therapeutics, and that suppression of CDK4/6 activity does not
antagonize standard of care AR-directed therapies.
CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition sensitizes PCa cells to ionizing
radiation (IR)
Radiation therapy in conjunction with novel therapeutics is
frequently used to treat locally advanced PCa.1,2,44 Therefore, the
capacity of PD to cooperate with IR was assessed (Figure 3). As
expected, single-agent treatment with PD or IR (compared with
vehicle) suppressed long-term cell growth (at day 7) indicated by
in vitro cell growth kinetics of LNCaP, LAPC4 and VCaP cells
(Figure 3a) and parallel colony formation assays (Supplementary
Figure 2). Concurrent treatment with PD and IR resulted in a
signiﬁcant attenuation in cell growth (compared with either
single-agent alone) for LNCaP, LAPC4 and VCaP cells. All cell lines
(Table 1, data calculated from the raw data in Figure 3a)
demonstrated prolonged doubling times (compared with vehicle)
either on individual (PD: 1  2- to 1  6-fold or IR: 1  4- to 2.0-fold) or
combined treatments (PD þ IR: 2.4- to 3.7-fold). PD treatment
alone substantiated the above ﬁndings that CDK4/6-speciﬁc
inhibition suppresses proliferation. In addition, the ability of PD
to cooperate with IR was determined using a clonogenic survival
assay (Figure 3b). Importantly, these studies further demonstrated

that the combination of PD and IR (at 2 or 4 Gy, doses higher than
6 Gy yielded no colonies (data not shown)) signiﬁcantly reduced
the number of colonies formed as compared with IR treatment
alone. Combined, these data indicate that PD cooperates with
and/or sensitizes PCa cells to the effects of IR.
CRPC cells are amenable to CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition, dependent
on RB status
Based on the ﬁndings above that PD showed a remarkable
capacity to not only inhibit proliferation but also act in concert
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

with IR to limit growth of hormone-sensitive PCa cells, it was
surmised that CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition could be advantageous
in the treatment of CRPC, which is typically associated with
increased proliferative/survival capacity and poor outcome.1 To
challenge this hypothesis, a collection of diverse CRPC cells were
treated with PD, and ﬂow cytometry and gene expression analyses
were performed to evaluate the overall response of CRPC cells to
therapy (Figure 4). Cell cycle analyses of PC3M cells (Figure 4a), a
variant of the PCa-derived PC3 cell line with bone homing
potential, indicated that PD treatment resulted in an increased
percentage of cells in G0/G1 with a concomitant decrease in S and

Figure 2. AR-directed therapies are effective in the presence of CDK4/6-specific inhibition. To assess AR activity, androgen-dependent PCa
cells: (a) LNCaP (b) LAPC4 and (c) VCaP were cultured 72 h in media containing steroid-deprived serum (5% charcoal-dextran treated (CDT))
then stimulated 24 h with (or without) DHT (1 nM) in the presence of PD (0.5 mM), Csdx (10 mM) or combination of PD and Csdx. Relative mRNA
expression normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the known AR-target
genes: KLK3/PSA (left), TMPRSS2 (middle) and KLK2 (right). Indicated treatments for each gene are relative to non-DHT and non-drug treated

G2M (treated vs control (%): 86.1 vs 61.7, 8.27 vs 28.8, 3.24 vs 8,
respectively). PC3M cells, because of a lack of detectable AR,
represent a rare form of CRPC.45 These data not only demonstrate
the effectiveness of PD in multiple forms of PCa, but also are
consistent with the above ﬁndings (Figure 2) that the effects of PD
on proliferation are independent of AR.
Although PD was effective at limiting AR-negative CRPC cell
proliferation, the vast majority of CRPC cases remain AR positive.1
Therefore, it is essential to evaluate PD in the context of CRPC cells
that maintain AR. Based on the mechanism of action of PD, it was
hypothesized that the capacity of PD to limit CDK4/6-dependent
proliferation is dictated by the status of RB. Recently, isogenic PCa
tumor models of RB loss were developed, wherein it was shown
that RB loss is a critical mediator of the transition to castration
resistance, and promotes lethal phenotypes through enhanced AR
levels and activity.46 Thus, using isogenic pairs derived from
LNCaP cells with and without RB knockdown, the notion that RB is
required for PD action was assessed. Importantly, cell cycle
Oncogene (2013) 5481 – 5491

analysis of this CRPC model system treated with PD (Figure 4b)
indicated that RB loss is sufﬁcient to promote PD resistance.
Moreover, the ability of RB loss to promote therapeutic bypass of
PD was conﬁrmed by stable transduction of the shRB1 construct
into PC3 (which lack AR), LAPC4 and VCaP cell model systems
(Supplementary Figure 3). Thus, in these diverse cellular contexts,
the data overwhelmingly support the concept that the effectiveness of PD is dependent on the integrity of RB.
Additional studies were performed using two common CRPC
cells (22Rv1 and LNCaP-derived C4-2, both positive for RB and AR)
that represent different pathways of acquired resistance to
hormone-based therapy. For these studies, 22Rv1 and C4-2 cells
(Figure 4; panels c and d, respectively) were cultured and treated
in conditions that mimic ADT. As expected, both cell models
proliferated with control treatments as indicated by the percentage of cells in S-phase. Treatment of both 22Rv1 and C4-2 cells
with PD resulted in an increased percentage of cells in G0/G1
(treated vs control (%)—22Rv1: 85.6 vs 55, C4-2: 85.1 vs 69.2)

paralleled by decreased S (treated vs control (%)—22Rv1: 10.2 vs
34.1, C4-2: 6.77 vs 18) and G2M (treated vs control (%)—22Rv1:
4.27 vs 10.9, C4-2: 6.21 vs 8.47). To evaluate the impact of PD on
AR signaling and potential utility in combination with ADT in CRPC
disease, gene expression analyses were performed using C4-2 cells
(Figure 4e). AR-target (that is, KLK3/PSA and TMPRSS2) gene
expression was similar to hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells (Figure 2),
suggesting that PD does not interfere with ADT in the CRPC
setting. These data demonstrate that PD effectively attenuated
proliferation of multiple CRPC models, independent of AR status
and/or standard ADT therapy. Moreover, PD action is dependent
on RB, suggesting the need to stratify patients based on RB status.

CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition impacts PCa tumor proliferation both
in vivo and in ex vivo primary human tumors
Although CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibition is effective against androgendependent and CRPC cell proliferation or growth in vitro,
additional analyses were performed to discern the in vivo beneﬁt
of PD treatment in PCa systems (Figure 5). For these studies, VCaP
cells were used as they harbor two clinically relevant aberrations:
(1) elevated AR that is frequently associated with disease
progression, and (2) chromosomal rearrangements that fuse ETS
oncogenes (ERG or ETV) under androgen/AR control via the
TMPRSS2 regulatory locus as seen in 50–75% of PCa.47 Mice
harboring VCaP xenografts were treated with PD (150 mg/kg) or
lactate vehicle, consistent with known dosage regimens.18,22,25,28,48
VCaP tumor proliferation was determined using immunohistochemistry against endogenous Ki-67 (Figure 5a, left panel).
As expected, VCaP tumors in control treated animals were
proliferative. In contrast, treatment with PD resulted in a reduction
in Ki-67. Quantiﬁcation (Figure 5a, right panel) revealed a
signiﬁcant reduction (65.8%) in VCaP proliferation upon PD
treatment. As the data in Figure 4 indicated that RB is a critical
factor for PD action, in vivo xenograft growth was evaluated using
the PC3 cells (described in Supplementary Figure 3) treated with a
short course of PD. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4A, PC3shNS cells had a delayed growth response following treatment
with PD. These data were expected based on previous studies in
other model systems.13,22,24,25,32 In contrast, PC3-shRB1 cells
showed a growth proﬁle similar to that of vehicle-treated PC3shNS cells. Together, these in vivo data indicate that PD is
sufﬁcient to reduce xenograft proliferation and delay growth in an
RB-dependent manner.
Encouraged by the xenograft data, additional studies were
performed using a novel ex vivo culture system.49 Human
prostatectomy tissues (processed into B1 mm3 explants) were
cultured, using standard cell culture growth media and
components, on sterile dental sponges to allow for efﬁcient
media/oxygen exchange. Using these conditions the tumor tissue
maintains many of its characteristics including: histology, AR
status, proliferative capacity and stromal environment.49 This
ex vivo assay affords the potential to assess novel therapies in
tissue that is one-step removed from the patient without the
difﬁculty and expense of implanting tissue into animals. In proof
of concept, we obtained tissue specimens from ﬁve patients that
were subsequently determined to be RB proﬁcient (Figure 5b, left
panel; representative RB-positive tumor and corresponding
hematoxylin and eosin). Explant tissues were treated, as described
in the Materials and methods section, for a short- and long-term
duration (days 2 and 6, respectively) in the presence of two
different concentrations of PD (0.5 and 1.0 mM). As shown
(Figure 5b, right panel; same specimen as left panel), ex vivo
culture for 6 days in control or two concentrations of PD did not
overtly disrupt the glandular structure as indicated by hematoxylin
and eosin staining. Similarly, minimal cell death was observed as
determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling, in both long-term control and treated

Figure 4. CRPC cells are sensitive to CDK4/6-specific inhibition, dependent on RB status. The relevance of PD treatment to advanced PCa was
determined using multiple CRPC cell model systems. Flow cytometry was performed on CRPC cells: (a) PC3M; (b) LNCaP shRB1 (stable LNCaP
cells depleted of the RB protein); (c) 22Rv1; and (d) C4-2 treated with control (left panels) or PD (right panels), as described in Figure 1a.

explants (data not shown). Ki-67 staining, described in the
Materials and methods section, indicated that both PD concentrations reduced proliferation compared with the control. As shown
(Figure 5c), short-term treatment with 1 mM PD signiﬁcantly
inhibited proliferation (82.1%), and long-term treatment demonstrated that the inhibition is dose dependent (46.8 and 85.7%).
Interestingly, long-term proliferation of explant tissues at the
higher PD concentrations was equally attenuated as the shortterm treatment, suggesting a response with PD can be achieved
early in treatment. Having deﬁned the proliferative response of
explant tissues to PD, additional studies were performed to
evaluate the capacity of PD to enhance the therapeutic potential
Oncogene (2013) 5481 – 5491

of IR (Supplementary Figure 4B). These ex vivo data, similar to the
data obtained in Figure 3, indicated that PD has the potential to
cooperate with IR. As the data above indicated that the response
of PCa cells is dependent on RB, explant tissues were transduced
with the shNS and shRB1 constructs and treated with or without
PD (Supplementary Figure 4C). As expected, based on the cell and
xenograft data, PD reduced the proliferation of explant tissue that
had been transduced with shNS. Importantly, PD was ineffective in
explant tissues that had been transduced with shRB1; thus, these
data are consistent with the notion that RB is a critical determinant
for the response to PD in PCa. These studies, using xenografts
in vivo and human PCa tissues ex vivo, demonstrate that CDK4/6

can be selectively targeted in an RB-dependent manner to limit
proliferation and growth. Overall, these data suggest that PD can
be developed as an adjuvant means to suppress tumor growth in
RB-positive tumors.
DISCUSSION
Proliferation and growth are hallmark phenotypes in cancer and
are frequently regulated by the activity of CDK4/6.7 In the past,
therapeutic targeting of CDK4/6 activity has been limited to panCDK inhibitors, often resulting in adverse effects.6 Most notably,
for PCa, the broad spectrum CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol resulted in
adverse effects and toxicity in phase I trials.10,50 During phase II
trials, the dosage was reduced, patients were removed because of
unacceptable toxicity, and increased adverse effects were
observed, indicating that drug toxicity was a contributing factor
for the poor efﬁcacy.11 Recently, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD)
has been developed with a more favorable phase I toxicity
proﬁle;12,13 however, the impact of PD in PCa has not been
explored. Herein, it was demonstrated that PD: (1) effectively
limited proliferation of hormone-sensitive and CRPC cells in vitro,

xenografts in vivo and primary human tumor tissues ex vivo;
(2) cooperated with existing treatments to enhance therapeutic
impact without negating standard ADT; and (3) was mechanistically
dependent on the RB tumor suppressor, suggesting the necessity
for precision medicine. These pre-clinical ﬁndings represent the
most comprehensive assessment of PD as a viable and potential
combination therapy for PCa.
The molecular target of PD is exceedingly clear, in that it is a
highly selective CDK inhibitor with a well-documented potency for
CDK4/6 (IC50 B10–15 nM) as compared with CDK2 (IC50 45 mM).12
CDK4/6 activity serves a specialized role, to initiate proliferation of
a number of diverse tumor types, through the phosphorylation
and inactivation of the RB tumor-suppressor family.38 In PCa, it has
been shown that RB-directed CDK4 activity is important for
androgen-dependent proliferation.3 Importantly, PD-inhibited PCa
proliferation/growth and RB phosphorylation at Ser780 (a known
CDK4/6 phosphorylation site), providing additional evidence that
the mechanism underpinning androgen-dependent proliferation
is mediated by CDK4. Interestingly, CDK4 levels are maintained in
PCa,51 suggesting that CDK4 activity has a signiﬁcant role in
proliferation. Androgen withdrawal or stimulation does not alter

CDK4 protein levels, suggesting the possibility of targeting CDK4
in combination with standard ADT. Previous investigation revealed
that androgen-stimulated CDK4 activity, in part, is regulated by
mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent induction of D-type
cyclins.3 Thus, it would be of future interest to simultaneously
target CDK4/6 and mammalian target of rapamycin. It has been
recently shown that mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition
confers sensitivity of PCa cell proliferation/growth to IR.44 For
patients with locally advanced PCa, addition of radiotherapy has
become standard-of-care;52 therefore, the ability of PD to
cooperate with IR in the PCa models tested suggests that CDK4/6
inhibition alone or in combination with other treatments may be
beneﬁcial. Consistent with this, others have shown that PD may
cooperate with radiation to suppress glioblastoma multiforme
tumor cell growth.32 However, additional studies are needed to
reveal the full potential of PD in the context of locally advanced
PCa. Overall, these data support a model wherein cyclin D1–CDK4/
are integral to PD-mediated cell cycle inhibition in PCa cells and
suggest the feasibility for combinatorial therapy.
In accordance with a cyclin D1–CDK4/6-dependent pathway, PD
modestly upregulated cyclin D1 protein levels in the LNCaP and
LAPC4 cells. The mechanism of PD-mediated cyclin D1 induction is
somewhat enigmatic as therapeutics that result in G1-arrest often
exhibit increased cyclin D1 turnover.40 Initially, it was thought that
PD could be inducing a compensatory induction of cyclin D1
expression; however, the levels of cyclin D1 induction were not
sufﬁcient to override the PD-mediated cell cycle inhibition.
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of CDK4 indicated a modest
increase in cyclin D1 association, suggesting a potential
mechanism whereby PD may retain cyclin D1 and CDK4 into an
inactive complex, thereby protecting cyclin D1 from turnover. A
recent crystallographic study of cyclin D1/CDK4 indicated that
CDK4 was in an inactive conﬁguration that resembled other
inactive CDKs or p19-inhibited CDK6.53–56 Although speculative,
PD could be inducing a similar inactive conformation of CDK4.
Unfortunately, no structural analysis is available for cyclin
D1/CDK4 in the presence of PD and low-resolution (3 Å) analysis
of cyclin V/CDK6 with PD does not indicate an inactive
conformation.57 Nonetheless, based on the well-characterized
ability of cyclin D1, independent of CDK4, to control AR activity, it
was hypothesized that PD-induced cyclin D1 accumulation/
sequestration with CDK4 might limit the ability of cyclin D1 to
hinder genomic AR activity resulting in a modest increase in AR
target genes. Consistent with this, AR target gene expression (that
is, KLK3/PSA) with PD was, in general, modestly increased in the
absence or presence of DHT in cells that exhibited increased cyclin
D1 (that is, LNCaP and LAPC4). Interestingly, PD exposure in VCaP
cells did not show evidence of cyclin D1 accumulation; yet, AR
target gene expression was modestly elevated but only in the
absence of DHT, suggesting additional factors are involved. One
factor may be CDK6 as it has been shown to interact with and
enhance AR activity, independent of its kinase activity or
association with cyclin D1.58 In addition, CDK6 overexpression in
LNCaP cells displayed increased KLK3/PSA expression as well as
increased secreted PSA protein in the absence or presence of
androgen. Alternatively, although phospho- or total extracellular
signal-regulated kinase levels were unchanged by PD
(Supplementary Figure 1D), it is possible that PD inﬂuences other
non-genomic AR targets. Thus, it will be important to discern the
broader implications of PD-induced cyclin D1 accumulation with
regard to regulating AR activity. It will also be of interest to
determine if cyclin D1 and/or CDK6 has any predictive value
concerning the response to PD or the potential bypass to therapy
in PCa.
As with many drug interventions, a major hurdle is to accurately
assess the probability of treatment response or development of
resistance. To this point, a number of potential mechanisms have
been implicated that may circumvent PD action. For example,
Oncogene (2013) 5481 – 5491

elevated cyclin E1 levels could confer downstream CDK2
activation, as has been suggested by gene expression proﬁling
from a panel of PD-resistant ovarian cancer cells.37 However, cyclin
E1 protein levels in PCa cells after PD treatment did not reveal any
induction, suggesting that other mechanisms may exist or longerterm treatments are needed to observe changes in potential
mechanisms of PD resistance. It is generally held that the majority
of CDK4/6 activity targets RB;38 therefore, based on initial and
continuing reports describing PD action, the most probable
candidate to nullify the response to PD is RB loss. This study
demonstrates that PD-mediated inhibition of PCa proliferation
requires RB. Moreover, it was recently identiﬁed that disruption of
RB is frequently observed in late-stage, human CRPC.46 These
observations suggest that RB disruption might predict the
development of resistance to therapeutic agents that inhibit
CDK4/6 activity. In addition to allelic loss, RB inactivation occurs
through a host of mechanisms that retain RB protein but cripple
its tumor-suppressor function.38 Thus, it is hypothesized that
tumors stratiﬁed based on gene expression ‘signatures’ indicative
of functional RB could signiﬁcantly impact therapeutic potential.59
To this end, we tailored a robust cohort of genes using multiple
model systems that reﬂect functional RB and have validated its
application using gene expression data from human PCa and
CRPC specimens.39 Based on the knowledge that RB is generally
inactivated during the transition to late-stage CRPC, it is
postulated that early-stage PCa patients stratiﬁed according to
functional RB would beneﬁt from PD-mediated CDK4/6 inhibition.
In this study, a number of well-characterized CRPC cells
maintained responsiveness to PD implying that a subset of
patients with CRPC may have functional RB and could potentially
beneﬁt from targeted CDK4/6 inhibition. Therefore, understanding
the timing and response to cell cycle therapy in CRPC is of the
utmost importance as the vast majority of patients who succumb
to disease have CRPC.1 In addition, recent observations have
shown that CRPC cells have developed unique alterations in cell
cycle.60 It will be of interest to determine if PD alters the ‘rewired’
cell cycle program in the CRPC setting. Finally, it was shown that
CRPC cells were amenable to PD treatment when grown in
conditions that mimic standard ADT. Therefore, it will be of
interest to examine the combination of PD with more recently
developed second-generation, hormone-based therapies61 (for
example, CYP17A1 inhibitors, abiraterone; or AR antagonists,
MDV3100) or approved anti-mitotic chemotherapies62 (for
example, microtubule stabilizers, docetaxel) in the context of
CRPC as well as hormone-sensitive PCa.
In summary, this study provides a compelling rationale for the
use of CDK4/6-selective inhibitors, such as PD, in the treatment of
PCa. These pre-clinical and mechanistic ﬁndings suggest that
CDK4/6 inhibition may provide beneﬁt for PCa patients through:
(i) suppressed proliferation/growth in both hormone-sensitive and
castration-resistant contexts, (ii) potential combinatorial therapy
with IR or hormone-based therapeutics and (iii) approaches that
use personalized medicine to evaluate functional RB status before
treatment. Together, these studies not only highlight the clinical
potential of PD to beneﬁt PCa patient outcome, but also support a
role for CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibitors for the treatment of cancers that
are dependent on the cyclin/CDK/RB-axis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatments
Androgen-dependent PCa (LNCaP, LAPC4 and VCaP) and CRPC (LNCaPshRB1, C4-2, 22Rv1 and PC3M) cells were maintained as previously
described.46,63 Unless otherwise indicated, cells (1.8  104/cm2) were
plated 24 h in growth media using standard serum (5–10% fetal bovine
serum) and then treated 24 h with 0.5 mM PD (Pﬁzer, New York, NY, USA) or
0.1% dimethylsulphoxide. C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells were treated as above,
except cells were washed thrice in phosphate-buffered saline and plated in

serum (HyClone, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) to mimic
castrate conditions.

Flow cytometry
PCa cells were challenged, as described above, and both adherent and
non-adherent cells were harvested, gently re-suspended in 100% ethanol,
and ﬁxed overnight at  20 1C. Proliferation was measured by bivariate
ﬂow cytometry using a 2-h pulse-label of BrdU (Amersham (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences), Pittsburgh, PA, USA, RPN201) before harvest and cell cycle
position using propidium iodide staining, as described.44 A Coulter Epics
XL Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to
capture 20 000 BrdU/propidium iodide or 15 000 propidium iodide events
for proliferation and cell cycle position, respectively. FlowJo software
(TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA) was used to gate for percent BrdU
incorporation or cell cycle position using the cell cycle algorithm.

Immunoblotting
Control- and PD-treated cells, described above, were harvested to evaluate
protein expression and interaction of cell cycle components. Brieﬂy, total
protein (30 mg) was separated by standard sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
and immunoblotted overnight at 4 1C. Antibodies and dilutions (1:1000)
used are: AR (SC-816), CDK4 (SC-601); cyclins: A (SC-596), D1 (Neomarkers,
Fremont, CA, USA, AB3) and E (SC-198); ppRB-pS780 (Cell Signaling,
Beverly, MA, USA, 9307), Ran (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, 610340).
Immunoblots were quantiﬁed using a LI-COR Odyssey (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE,
USA).

in accordance with Institutional Review Board standards and in compliance
with federal regulations governing research on de-identiﬁed specimens
and/or clinical data (45 CFR 46.102(f)). Tumors were dissected by a clinical
pathologist under sterile conditions and collected in processing media:
improved minimum essential medium (5% fetal bovine serum, 0.01 mg/ml
insulin (Invitrogen, 12585-014), 30 mM hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA, H-0888) and penicillin/streptomycin). Tissue was minced
into B1 mm3 pieces and placed (2–3 pieces per well) in a 24-well plate on
pre-soaked, 1 cm3 dental sponges (Novartis Animal Health, Greensboro,
NC, USA, Vetspon) containing 0.5 ml of processing media with either 0.5 or
1 mM PD. Treatments and controls were refreshed every 48 h and explants
were harvested at early and late time points (days 2 and 6, respectively) for
histological assessment. Control- and PD-treated explants (n ¼ 5 patients)
with evidence of glandular epithelial tissue, as determined by a clinical
pathologist, were stained for Ki-67 using clinically approved protocols by
the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Xenograft and explant stained
slides were quantiﬁed for percent Ki-67 using an AperioScope AT and
Spectrum software using the nuclear staining algorithm (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA).

Irradiation, clonogenic assay
Combinatorial therapy was determined by plating cells (day 0) in growth
media containing standard serum conditions and treated with PD (day 1),
described above, then 2 Gy of IR using a Pantak X-RAD orthovoltage X-ray
irradiator (calibrated daily using a Victoreen dosimeter, Victoreen, Cleveland, OH, USA). Following treatment, growth media (lacking PD) was
replaced (days 2 and 5) and cells were counted (days 3, 5 and 7) by a
hemacytometer using the Trypan blue exclusion method. Cell doubling
times were calculated as described.64 Brieﬂy, doubling time in days ¼ ((log
2)  (tf  ti))/(log (qf/qi)) where ti ¼ initial time, tf ¼ ﬁnal time, qi ¼ cell
number at ti, qf ¼ cell number at tf. Clonogenic survival was determined by
plating LNCaP cells at varying densities in poly-L-lysine coated 50 ml ﬂasks.
After 24 h, cells were treated with 0.5 mM PD and IR or IR alone (at indicated
IR doses). Cells were allowed to grow for 14 days, colonies were ﬁxed in
100% cold ethanol and stained with 1% crystal violet in 2.5% acetic acid.

Xenografts
Xenograft studies were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines and
animal protocols were approved by Thomas Jefferson University. VCaP
cells (1.5  106) were combined 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 354234)
and inoculated subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of 6 weeks, intact-male mice
(NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD, USA; NOD.SCID/NCr, 01N31). Tumors were
measured with calipers and matched for an average size of 700 mm3, oral
gavage was initiated (day 0) with PD (150 mg/kg, n ¼ 4 mice) or control
(sodium lactate pH 8.0, n ¼ 4 mice) and re-dosed twice (days 2 and 4).
Tumors from control- and PD-treated mice were harvested (day 5), 24 h
after the ﬁnal treatment. Tumors were processed and sections stained for
Ki-67 (1:250; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 18-0191Z) using described
methodology.65
