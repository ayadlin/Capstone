Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (Brca1) has a key role in both hereditary and sporadic
mammary tumorigenesis. However, the reasons why Brca1-deficiency leads to the development of
cancer are not clearly understood. Activation of Akt kinase is one of the most common molecular
alterations associated with human malignancy. Increased Akt kinase activity has been reported in
most breast cancers. We previously found that downregulation of Brca1 expression or mutations
of the Brca1 gene activate the Akt oncogenic pathway. To further investigate the role of Brca1/
Akt in tumorigenesis, we analyzed Brca1/Akt expression in human breast cancer samples and
found that reduced expression of Brca1 was highly correlated with increased phosphorylation of
Akt. Consistent with the clinical data, knockdown of Akt1 by short-hairpin RNA inhibited cellular
proliferation of Brca1 mutant cells. Importantly, depletion of Akt1 significantly reduced tumor
formation induced by Brca1-deficiency in mice. The third generation inhibitor of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), Palomid 529, significantly suppressed Brca1-deficient tumor growth
in mice through inhibition of both Akt and mTOR signaling. Our results indicate that activation of
Akt is involved in Brca1-deficiency mediated tumorigenesis and that the mTOR pathway can be
used as a novel target for treatment of Brca1-deficient cancers.

Introduction
Germline mutations of the Brca1 gene account for 50% of hereditary breast cancers and
85% of the families whose members have a high incidence of breast cancers (Miki et al.,
1994; Narod and Foulkes, 2004). Although Brca1 gene mutations are rare in sporadic breast

cancers, Brca1 protein expression is frequently reduced or absent in sporadic cases
(Thompson et al., 1995), suggesting a much wider role of Brca1 in both hereditary and
sporadic mammary tumorigenesis. The Brca1 protein contains an N-terminal ring domain
and C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs that are phosphoprotein binding motifs. The BRCT
domains are important for the tumor-suppressor function of Brca1. Most Brca1 mutations
result in truncated Brca1 gene products that lack one or both C-terminal BRCT domains.
Clinically relevant missense mutations identified at the C-terminus of Brca1 abolish the
structure of BRCT. Loss of the Brca1 BRCT domains leads to tumor formation in mice
(Ludwig et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2001; Brodie and Deng, 2001; Deng, 2006). We previously
showed that Brca1-deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway (Xiang et al., 2008).
Mutation of Brca1 gene increases the phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Akt. The
Brca1-BRCT domains directly bind to phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), leading to its
ubiquitination towards protein degradation. Brca1 mutant cells lacking the BRCT repeats
accumulate nuclear pAkt and consequently inactivate the transcriptional activity of FOXO3a, a main nuclear target of pAkt (Brunet et al., 1999; Tran et al., 2003). Here, we
demonstrate that the Brca1/Akt1 pathway contributes to tumorigenesis and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a therapeutic target for Brca1-deficient cancers.

Up to 40–80% of human breast cancers exhibit decreased expression of Brca1 or increased
activation of Akt1 (Thompson et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2001; Narod and Foulkes, 2004;
Wickenden and Watson, 2010). These alterations can be detected by immunohistochemical
(IHC) analysis in breast cancers with Brca1 antibodies or antibodies against pAkt (S473),
respectively. To test whether defects in Brca1 expression correlate with activation of Akt1 in
breast cancers, we performed IHC analysis on a panel of human breast cancer samples with
antibodies of Brca1 (Ab-1, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA, USA) and pAkt (S473, Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA)) as described (Wilson et al., 1999; Kirkegaard
et al., 2005; Puc et al., 2005; Dinesh et al., 2006). Cancer tissue samples were obtained from
101 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy or breast conserving surgery
(Supplementary Table 1). Competitive peptides of pAkt and Brca1 blocked the
immunostaining signals of pAkt and Brca1 antibodies, respectively, confirming the
specificity of these antibodies (data not shown). The positive reaction of Brca1 and pAkt
were scored into four grades according to the intensity of the staining (0, none; 1+, weakly
positive; 2+, moderately positive; and 3+, strongly positive). In all, 0 and 1+ were recorded
as negative, and 2+ and 3+ were recorded as positive (Supplementary Figure 1). Sections
were independently scored by two investigators with double-blind evaluations. The results
showed that about 69% (n=70) of tumor tissue samples had decreased Brca1 staining,
whereas about 61% of the 101 specimens displayed positive staining for pAkt (Figure 1a). In
total, 71% (50/70) of the samples with reduced expression of Brca1 also displayed increased
pAkt, indicating that Brca1 expression inversely correlates with Akt1 activation in human
breast cancers and supporting our hypothesis that activation of Akt1 is involved in Brca1deficient cancer development. Figure 1b showed positive and negative IHC staining samples
of Brca1 and pAkt in the same cases. There is no statistical difference of clinicalpathological features between Brca1 and pAkt groups (Supplementary Table 1).
We examined Ki67 expression, a proliferation marker, by IHC and found that 63% (61/97)
of the samples showed Ki67 positive staining (Supplementary Table 2). The frequency of
Ki67-positive tumors was significantly higher in pAkt-positive (71%, 43/61) and Brca1negative tumors (77%, 47/61), compared with pAkt-negative (47%, 17/36) and Brca1positive tumors (56%, 20/36), respectively. These results are consistent with previous
reports (Ding et al., 2004; Pallares et al., 2005; Aaltonen et al., 2009; van der et al., 2009;
Aleskandarany et al., 2010), suggesting that pAkt-positive and Brca1-negative tumors are

associated with tumor proliferation. It has been suggested that PIK3CA mutations activate
Akt function through its phosphorylation, thus, we investigated the relationship between
PIK3CA mutations and the expression of pAkt and Brca1. In all, 44 mutations in PIK3CA
(exon 9 and 20) were identified out of a total of 99 samples (Supplementary Table 2). The
frequency of PIK3CA mutations was significantly higher in pAkt-positive tumors (77%,
34/44) than pAkt-negative tumors (23%, 10/44). However, Brca1 negative/pAkt positive
tumors were not significantly associated with PIK3CA mutations (47%, 23/49) compared
with PIK3CA wild type (54%, 26/49) (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that there are
different mechanisms for pAkt activation.

Brca1 directly binds to pAkt kinase and down-regulates its activation through the
ubiquitination pathway leading to its degradation (Xiang et al., 2008). To investigate the
effects of interaction of Brca1/Akt on tumorigenesis, we determined the Akt1 binding
domains to Brca1. Akt1 contains three functional domains, the N-terminal pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain, the kinase domain (KD) and the hydrophobic motif (HM) domain.
To map the Brca1 binding sites of Akt1, we generated HA-tagged Akt1 deletion mutants,
including HA-ΔPH (deletion amino acids 6–107), HA-ΔKD (deletion amino acids 149–408)
and HA-ΔHM (deletion amino acids 409–476). HA-tagged full-length or deletion mutants of
AKT1 were transfected into immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The cell
lysates were incubated with the GST-BRCT domain of Brca1. The GST complex was eluted
and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-GST or anti-HA antibody. The HA-ΔHM
mutant was not present in GST-Brca1 BRCT complex, indicating that the HM domain of
Akt1 binds to BRCA1 (Supplementary Figure 2).

Next, we addressed whether inhibition of Akt1 affects cell proliferation. Loss of the Brca1BRCT domains that bind to pAkt leads to mammary cancer formation in mice (Ludwig et
al., 2001). We previously found that MEFs from the mouse expressing a truncated Brca1
allele lacking the BRCT repeats (Brca1tr/tr) showed higher levels of pAkt, compared with
Brca1+/+ MEFs (Xiang et al., 2008). Using the MEFs, we performed the MTT assays.
Depletion of Akt1 by short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shAkt1-A&B) significantly reduced
cell viabilities in Brca1tr/tr MEFs compared with GFP-shRNA control cells (shGFP) or
Brca1+/+ MEFs (Figure 2a). The pAkt level was markedly decreased in cells stably
expressing shAkt1. To further examine the relationship among Akt, Brca1 and proliferation,
the colony formation assays in soft agar were performed. Only Brca1tr/tr MEFs, but not
Brca1+/+ MEFs formed colonies (Figure 2b and data not shown). Depletion of Akt1 by
shRNAs (shAkt1-A&B) significantly reduced colony formation in Brca1tr/tr MEFs
compared with that of shGFP. Overexpression of Akt1-S473D, a constitutively active form,
increased colony formation in Brca1tr/tr MEFs with depletion of Akt1 (Figure 2c).
Expression of Akt1-ΔHM mutant that does not have the binding domain to Brca1 did not
rescue colony formation by depletion of Akt1. These results indicate that the interaction of
Brca1 with Akt1 is responsible for Brca1/Akt1-mediated proliferation.
To test whether depletion of Akt1 inhibits the tumorigenicity associated with Brca1deficiency, Brca1tr/tr MEFs stably expressing either the shGFP or shAkt1 were implanted
into SCID mice, and tumor formation was monitored for 9 weeks. Implantation of control
shGFP Brca1tr/tr MEFs resulted in tumor formation in 18 of 20 mice (90%, Figure 3a).
Expressions of shAkt1-A and shAKT-B were sufficient to dramatically suppress tumor
development and only 5–6 of 20 mice generated tumors, respectively. In addition, depletion
of Akt1 also resulted in a striking reduction in tumor size compared with those from shGFP
control Brca1tr/tr MEFs (Figure 4a). Western blot and IHC analysis of dissected tumors
revealed a marked reduction in pAkt levels in tumors from shAKT1-expressing cells
compared with those from shGFP control Brca1tr/tr MEFs (Figures 3b and c). Thus,

depletion of Akt1 in Brca1 deficient cells results in decrease of pAkt level, arrest of cell
proliferation, and, most importantly, suppression of tumor growth.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mTOR is a critical downstream effector of Akt, which contributes to tumorigenesis
(Hay, 2005; Sabatini, 2006; Guertin and Sabatini, 2007; Efeyan and Sabatini, 2010). The
third generation mTOR inhibitor, Palomid 529 (P529), is a novel small molecular drug
inhibiting the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes as well as the Akt activity (Xue et al., 2008;
Diaz et al., 2009). We tested the effects of P529 on Brca1-deficient tumors in mice and
found that P529 significantly inhibited Brca1-deficient tumor growth (Figures 4a and b).
Tumor growth in mice (n=18, Brca1tr/tr MEFs with shGFP group) was arrested by treatment
with P529 along with actual regression of the tumor size. Treatment of shAkt tumor-bearing
mice with P529 also inhibited tumor growth, but with less inhibitory effect compared with
those of Brca1tr/tr MEFs induced tumors (shGFP), suggesting that P529 may have better
therapeutic effects on tumors with high expressing level of pAkt, such as Brca1-deficient
tumors. Consistent with this hypothesis, P529 treatment for MCF7 (Brca1 wild type)induced tumors with knockdown of Akt1 also showed less inhibitory effect compared with
those of control (shGFP) or Brca1tr/tr MEFs-induced tumors (Figure 4b). Analyses of tumor
lysates by western blotting and IHC assays indicated that P529 reduced the levels of pAkt
and pS6 (Figures 4c and d and Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that P529 inhibits both
the pAkt and mTOR signaling.

Discussion
The tumor suppressor Brca1 is frequently inactivated in human breast cancers. However, the
extent to which Brca1-activated molecular pathways contribute to its tumor suppressor
activity remains unclear. Our preliminary results indicate that downregulation of Brca1
expression or mutations of the Brca1 gene activate the Akt1 oncogenic pathway (Xiang et
al., 2008). Brca1 directly binds to Akt1 kinase and downregulates its activation through the
ubiquitination pathway leading to its degradation. Here, we further provide evidence that the
Brca1-Akt1 pathway contributes to tumorigenesis and Akt1/mTOR is a novel therapeutic
target for Brca1-deficient cancers. In human breast cancers, reduced expression of Brca1 is
correlated with increased phosphorylation of Akt. These results support our hypothesis that
activation of Akt1 is involved in Brca1-deficiency mediated tumorigenesis.

The Akt/PKB kinase is a well-characterized effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and its
hyperactivation has an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Cellular
processes that are regulated by Akt1 include cell proliferation and survival, intermediary
metabolism, angiogenesis and tissue invasion. We found that knockdown of Akt1 reduces
Brca1-deficient cell proliferation. Moreover, the Akt1 mutant lacking the Brca1-binding
domain could not rescue this phenotype, suggesting that the interaction of Akt1 with Brca1
regulates cell proliferation mediated by Brca1 deficiency.
Mammalian cells contain three Akt isoforms (Akt1–3). Akt1 is the predominantly expressed
Akt isoform, and its deficiency reduced total Akt activity by ~50% (Chen et al., 2006). By
targeted disruption of the Akt1 gene, Chen et al. (2001) created an Akt1-null mouse model
with aberrant signaling in the Akt1 pathway. Recent reports show that partial inhibition of
Akt activity or inhibition of individual Akt isoform (Akt1) is sufficient to suppress cancer
development (Bellacosa et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Faivre et al., 2006). In
Akt1−/−Pten+/− mouse model, a deficiency of Akt1 is most effective as an inhibitor of
neoplasia induced by Pten inactivation (Chen et al., 2006). Even haplodeficiency of Akt1
can significantly attenuate the cancer development induced by Pten deficiency. Mice
expressing truncated Brca1tr/tr, which eliminates the C-terminal half of the protein product
(missing the BRCT domain), develop a variety of tumors in about ~85% of the mice

(Ludwig et al., 2001). Loss of the Brca1-BRCT domains that bind to Akt1 leads to
mammary cancer formation in mice implicates the potential role of Akt1 in Brca1-related
tumorigenesis. We implanted Brca1tr/tr MEFs in mice and generated tumors. The depletion
of Akt1 in Brca1tr/tr MEFs significantly reduces tumor formation, which provides direct
evidence that Akt1 is involved in Brca1-deficient cancer formation.

The mTOR is a critical downstream effector of Akt (Hay, 2005; Sabatini, 2006; Guertin and
Sabatini, 2007; Efeyan and Sabatini, 2010). The mTOR is associated with increased cell
proliferation and is activated by Akt (Hay, 2005; Inoki and Guan, 2006; Lee et al., 2007).
Akt activates mTOR through direct phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2,
which otherwise inhibits mTOR activity (Inoki et al., 2002, 2005; Hay, 2005). Tuberous
sclerosis complex 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 form a heterodimer with GTPase
activity that inhibits the activity of Rheb, a small GTPase required for mTOR activation.
Upon activation, mTOR, which forms a rapamycin-sensitive complex with Raptor
(regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), activates S6-kinase, a downstream substrate of
mTOR-Raptor (Hay, 2005; Inoki and Guan, 2006). First and second generation mTOR
inhibitors, such as rapamycin, have shown promise to inhibit tumor development. However,
because of the complex nature of mTOR signaling, these inhibitors can result in
counterproductive feedback signaling to potentiate upstream Akt signaling, leading to
minimal tumor inhibition in breast cancer clinical trials (Sarbassov et al., 2005; Guertin and
Sabatini, 2009; O’Reilly and McSheehy, 2010). P529 is the third generation mTOR inhibitor
and inhibits both the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes as well as the Akt activity (Xue et al.,
2008; Diaz et al., 2009). Our results showed that P529 not only significantly suppresses
tumor growth, but also reduces the size of tumors with high expressing level of pAkt, such
as Brca1-deficient tumors, suggesting a better therapeutic effect on Brca1-deficient tumors.
Our results demonstrate that Akt1 has a key role in Brca1-deficient caner development.
Reduced expression of Brca1 is correlated with increased phosphorylation of Akt1 in human
breast cancers. Interactions of Brca1 and Akt1 mediate cell proliferation. Depletion of Akt1
prevents cancer formation induced by Brca1-deficiency in mice. Targeting mTOR by P529
sufficiently suppresses Brca1-deficient cancer development. Thus, these results delineate the
contributions of Brca1/Akt1 pathway to tumorigenesis and establish the mTOR pathway as
novel therapeutic target for Brca1-deficient cancers.

cotransfected with the lentiviral vectors and compatible packaging plasmids mixture using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the lentivirus supernatant was
collected 40 h after transfection. For virus infection, cells were exposed to lentivirus
supernatant for 24 h in the presence of polybrene (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Protein
extracts from MEFs and xenograft tumors were extracted to conduct western blot analysis as
described previously (Xiang et al., 2008).

IHC assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human breast cancer tissue samples were obtained from 101 primary breast cancer patients
who underwent mastectomy or breast conserving surgery during the period from 1989 to
2008 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. IHC was performed by using Brca1, pAkt1S473
and Ki67 antibodies. Paraffin slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated by sequential
incubations in xylene, 100% ethanol and 95% ethanol. Endogenous peroxidases were
quenched for 20 min with 3% H2O2 at room temperature. An antigen retrieval step was
performed by placing slides in preheated sodium citrate buffer (10mM, pH 6.0) and heated
for 10 min in a pressure cooker. The slides were allowed to cool to room temperature. Slides
were blocked with 5%of goat serum in Tris buffered saline (TBS) buffer for 60 min at room
temperature. The diluted primary antibody was then added and incubated in a moist chamber
at 4 °C overnight. Biotinylated secondary antibody was added for 30 min at room
temperature. To detect primary antibody binding, ABC and DAB kits were applied
according to the manufacturer instruction (Vector Laboratories). After mounting, the slides
were observed under microscope and pictures were taken.
Mutation analysis of PIK3CA
Genomic DNA was prepared from the tumor samples as previously described (Yang et al.,
2000). PCR amplification was performed with primers previously described for exons 9 and
20 of PIK3CA (Samuels et al., 2004). Sequencing of the PCR products was conducted using
ABI 3300 automated capillary sequencer. The sequence data of PIK3CA gene from
GenBank (accession no. NM_006218). Genomic DNA from corresponding normal tissues
was subjected to sequence analysis to confirm the detected mutations.
MTT and soft agar assays
For the MTT assay, cells were plated and cultured 4 days to measure cell viability. All data
were normalized relative to the control. For the Soft agar assay, cells (10 000/dish) were
suspended in 2ml of 0.3% agar and poured over a 3 ml 0.6% solidified layer of agar in
60mm dishes. Cells were incubated for about 14–16 days until colonies were large enough
to visualize. Colonies were observed under phase contrast microscope. Experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Tumor growth experiments
Animal experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines for animal
welfare. Female NOD.SCID/NCR mice of 6–8 weeks of age were purchased from NCIFrederick Animal Production Program (Frederick, MA, USA). In all, 2×106 Brca1tr/tr MEFs
or MCF7 cells expressing GFP or Akt1 shRNA in 0.1ml PBS were mixed with equal
volume of matrigel. The cell mixture was implanted into mouse breast fat pad. After 9
weeks, the tumors became rigid and the volume of tumor ((L×W2)/2) is measured in range
of 180–250mm3. The mice were assigned to vehicle and P529 treatment groups and mean
tumor volumes at the start point for treatment were indistinguishable between the vehicle
and P529 treatment groups. P529-treated mice received 40mg/kg of P529 diluted in 100μl of
vehicle. Control mice received 100 μl of vehicle only. Drug or vehicle was delivered orally
every day for 18 days. At the end of treatment, the mice were killed and the tumors were
excised and processed to paraffin section and protein extraction.

Deletion of mouse Akt1 reduces proliferation of Brca1tr/tr MEFs. (a) The MTT assays were
performed to measure the cell viability of Brca1+/+ and Brca1tr/tr MEFs with or without
knockdown of Akt1. The quantitative data were summarized from three experiments. All
data were normalized relative to the control. The right panel showed western blot analysis of
pAkt (S473) and Akt1 levels in these MEFs. (b) Proliferation of Brca1tr/tr MEFs expressing
GFP and Akt1 shRNAs was detected by the soft agar assay. The lower panel showed
western blot analysis of pAkt (S473) and Akt1 levels. The quantitative data were
summarized from three colony formation assay experiments (right panel). (c) Active form of
Akt1-S473D, but not deletion of hydrophobic motif (HM) mutant, rescues colony formation
in Brca1tr/tr MEFs with Akt1 knockdown (shAkt-B, target sequence in 3′UTR). The right
panel showed western blot analysis of pAkt (S473) and Akt1 levels.

P529 significantly suppresses tumor growth in Brca1tr/tr xenograft tumors. (a) Tumor
growth rate after P529 treatment. The mice bearing xenograft tumors were assigned to
vehicle and P529 treatment groups and mean tumor volumes at the start point (after 9 weeks
implanting cells) for treatment were indistinguishable between the vehicle and P529
treatment groups. (b) Statistical analysis of effects of P529 on tumor growth for mice
bearing Brca1tr/tr MEFs or MCF7 xenograft tumors (after 18 days treatment). (c) P529
treatment inhibits both pS6S235/236 and pAktS473 expression levels in Brca1tr/tr xenograft
tumors. (d) IHC analysis of pS6S235/236 and pAktS473 in Brca1tr/tr xenograft tumors with or
without P529 treatment. Original magnification ×200.
