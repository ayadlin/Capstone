Abstract

Author Manuscript

The mechanisms by which some melanoma cells adapt to BRAF inhibitor therapy are
incompletely understood. In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based
phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of
melanoma cell lines that were BRAF-mutant and PTEN-null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was
associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTENdependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following
treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in
mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF
inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma TMA showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for
a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin

was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of
these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed
following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated
the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the
induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The
protection conveyed by the induction of fibronectin expression could be overcome through
combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

BRAF inhibitors are now the mainstay of systemic therapy for the 50% of patients whose
13
melanomas harbor BRAFV600 mutations - . In the clinic, treatment with BRAF inhibitors
such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib is associated with impressive responses, with significant
levels of tumor shrinkage (as measured by RECIST criteria) being seen in the majority of
patients. Most recently, a Phase III randomized study (COMBI-D) has demonstrated an
improved progression-free survival and overall response rate for patients treated with a
combination of dabrafenib plus the MEK inhibitor trametinib versus dabrafenib alone, and a
similar Phase 3 trial has demonstrated improved overall survival in patients treated with the
4 5
dabrafenib plus trametinib combination compared to vemurafenib monotherapy , . Based
on the durable objective responses observed to the combination of dabrafenib and
trametinib, the combination gained FDA approval for treatment of unresectable
BRAFV600E/K patients. Despite the initial success of BRAF inhibitor therapy, resistance is
common in most patients, with the reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway being
2
observed in >70% of relapsing tumors . Mechanistically, resistance to BRAF inhibition
seems to follow a course of shortterm adaptation in which small populations of cells evade
therapy through increased PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling followed by the acquisition of
mutations that sustain growth in the continual presence of drug. Emerging evidence suggests
the initial adaptive responses to result in part from the relief of feedback inhibition at the
level of Ras that sensitizes the melanoma cells to the pro-survival effects of exogenous
6 10
growth factors (including IGF-1R, PDGFR, c-MET, HER3 and FGFR) - . It has been
demonstrated that upregulation of expression and signaling through EGFR can also convey
11 12
resistance to BRAF inhibition , . Analysis of post-failure patient biopsies has identified
multiple resistance mechanisms including mutations in NRAS, MEK1, MEK2 and BRAF7 13 14
splice mutants , , . Melanoma has the highest mutational load of all tumors, and
frequently exhibits a complex genetic profile. Among these, melanomas that are both BRAF
mutant and PTEN-null (PTEN-) sometimes show a reduced response to vemurafenib and
15 16
dabrafenib , . A recent analysis of melanoma patients stratified on the basis of their PTEN
status, showed aberrant PTEN function not to be associated with the best overall response
17
and these patients to show a trend towards a lower progression-free survival (PFS) . There
is, however, evidence that some BRAF mutant/PTEN- melanoma cell lines still respond to
BRAF or MEK inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that other co-operating factors may also
18 19
contribute to intrinsic resistance , . At this time, the mechanisms underlying the intrinsic
resistance of some BRAF mutant/PTEN- melanomas to vemurafenib therapy remain poorly
defined. Most studies have focused upon the genetic changes that are associated with
acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance. In the current study, we used a proteomic approach to

evaluate modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in the short-term adaptive responses of
BRAFV600E/PTEN-melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibition. Through these methods, we
uncovered a previously uncharacterized fibronectin (FN)-derived protective niche that is
induced upon BRAF inhibition that drives therapeutic escape through α5β1 integrinmediated
maintenance of pro-survival Mcl-1 expression.

RESULTS
Inhibition of BRAF is associated with adaptive changes in the signaling network

Author Manuscript

To better understand the global vemurafenib-mediated adaptive changes in signaling, three
BRAFV600E/PTEN- mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with either vehicle or
vemurafenib (3 μM, 24 hrs), the tyrosine phosphorylated (pTyr) peptides were captured by
immunoprecipitation, and changes in the level of phosphorylation were analyzed by mass
20 21
spectrometry (Supplemental Figure 1) , . Quantification of the tyrosine phosphorylation
following BRAF inhibition using label-free MaxQuant revealed changes in 73-83 distinct
peptides, depending upon the cell line (Figures 1A-D: see Supplemental Table 1 for peptide
22
list and phosphorylation sites identified) . Of these, alterations in 57 pTyr peptides were
common to all three cell lines (Figure 1A, B). GeneGO process network analysis of proteins
exhibiting at minimum of 10% change in phosphorylation highlighted changes in pathways
implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling, RTK signaling, integrinmediated adhesion, and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure 1C). As expected, BRAF inhibitor
treatment led to the inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in all of the cell lines
tested (Figure 1D). Mapping of this data using KEGG software revealed vemurafenibtreatment to drive an adhesion signaling network involving integrin α5β1, Src, Talin and
FAK (Figure 1E).

BRAF inhibitor-associated integrin/FN signaling

Author Manuscript

A growth inhibition assay performed on a panel of PTEN- and PTEN+ melanoma cell lines
demonstrated that the vemurafenib IC50 was not correlated with PTEN expression, however,
we have previously showed that PTEN expression in BRAFV600E cell lines does correlate
with the extent of apoptosis induction following BRAF inhibition (Supplemental Figure
23
2) . A Western blot analysis of a panel of melanoma cell lines showed the PTEN- cohort to
express higher levels of integrin α5β1 and basal pAKT than their PTEN+ counterparts
(Figure 2A). As α5β1 integrin signaling is activated through binding to FN, we next asked
whether the adhesion phenotype identified using phosphoproteomics was the result of ECM
remodeling. BRAFV600E/PTEN- melanoma cell lines showed increased FN expression
following vemurafenib treatment, an effect not observed in the BRAFV600E/PTEN+ cohort
(Figure 2B, Supplemental Figures 3-5). ELISA assays showed an increase in active secretion
of FN into the cell culture media (Figure 2C). BRAF inhibition increased FN expression at
the mRNA level as measured by RT-qPCR (Figure 2D). These effects were not restricted to
vemurafenib treatment and were recapitulated following siRNA knockdown of BRAF
(Figure 2E, Supplemental Figures 6-7) as well as following treatment with cytotoxic drugs
such as cisplatin, carboplatin and paclitaxel (Figure 2F, Supplemental Figure 8-9).
Vemurafenib-mediated fibronectin upregulation was evident as early as after 2 hours of
treatment (Supplemental Figure 10A). The combination of the MEK inhibitor trametinib

with vemurafenib showed a similar effect to vemurafenib monotherapy (Supplemental
Figure 10B). The upregulation of FN expression is coupled with extracellular deposition of
FN as a functional matrix, as demonstrated by the ability of vemurafenib-induced FN to
promote melanoma cell adhesion (Supplemental Figure 11). No changes in other ECM
proteins that are known interactors of α5β1 integrin (such as vitronectin) were noted
(Supplemental Figure 12). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of tumors from 4 patients failing
vemurafenib therapy identified increased intratumoral FN in two cases (Figure 2G).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of an additional group of patient specimens (n=3)
identified one tumor with higher FN expression in the post- BRAF inhibitor relapse sample
that was absent in the initial specimen (Figure 2H).
BRAF inhibitor-associated integrin/FN signaling is PTEN dependent

Author Manuscript

As the induction of FN expression was only observed in the cell lines lacking a functional
form of PTEN, we next explored the PTEN dependency of FN induction. As expected,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTEN in WM164 cells (BRAF6000E/PTEN+) prior to
vemurafenib treatment led to increased FN expression upon treatment (Figure 3A,
Supplemental Figure 13). Conversely, induction of doxycycline-driven PTEN expression in
WM793TR cells (BRAF6000E/PTEN-) blocked the increase of FN expression following 24hour vemurafenib treatment (Figures 3B-D).
Integrin/FN signaling is crucial for melanoma cell survival on therapy

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous work from our group has shown that melanoma cell lines lacking PTEN expression
15
can show reduced cytotoxicity following BRAF inhibitor treatment . We next investigated
whether increased FN expression secondary to BRAF inhibition could contribute to
therapeutic escape. Knockdown of FN using an siRNA pool, as well as by three individual
siRNAs, significantly increased vemurafenib-mediated apoptosis (3 μM, 24 hrs) (Figures
4A,B and Supplemental Figure 14A). In these studies, cells were grown in 1% FBS to
reduce the survival benefit from FN in the serum. The low serum levels increased basal
levels of cell death particularly following treatment with the non-targeting siRNA. The
protective effects were mediated through integrin α5β1, with siRNA knockdown of α5
integrin found to significantly increase the level of vemurafenib-induced apoptosis (Figure
4C and Supplemental Figure 14B). Mouse xenograft studies show an induction of FN
expression in BRAF/PTEN- melanoma xenografts in response to treatment with the
vemurafenib analogue, PLX4720 (Figure 4D). In line with the reduced cytotoxicity seen in
vitro due to FN upregulation, the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 also exhibited significantly
weaker anti-tumor activity in BRAF/PTEN- melanoma xenografts compared to BRAF/
PTEN+ xenografts (Figure 4E). Unlike the tissue culture experiments, the BRAF6000E/
PTEN- tumor xenografts were found to have basal FN expression (Figure 4D). We reasoned
that this may have resulted from the increased stress the cells experience under xenograft
conditions, and demonstrated that mild acidosis (pH 6.7) - such as that seen in vivo - was
sufficient to induce FN expression in BRAF6000E/PTEN- cell lines (Supplemental Figure
14C,D). The clinical significance of PTEN loss and increased FN expression was
investigated on an annotated tissue microarray (TMA) of 93 individual stage III/IV
melanoma patient specimens (Supplemental Tables 2-4). Here, PTEN loss was associated
with significantly reduced (P<0.05) overall survival (OS) (Figure 4F, Supplemental Table 3),

with a trend towards reduced OS (median OS 15.1 months vs. 45.2 months for PTEN-/
FNHigh and PTEN+/FNLow, respectively) seen in patients with concurrent PTEN-/FNHigh
expression (Figure 4G-H, Supplemental Table 4).
Treatment-associated integrin/FN signaling protects melanoma cells from vemurafenibmediated cytotoxicity through increased PI3K/AKT signaling

Author Manuscript

Previous work from our group and others has demonstrated BRAF/MEK inhibition to be
15 19
associated with adaptive PI3K/AKT signaling , . We next utilized kinome arrays and
western blot studies to show that siRNA knockdown of FN abrogated the vemurafenibmediated increases in AKT phosphorylation (Figures 5A,B). The protective role of
PI3K/AKT signaling was confirmed by the ability of the PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941, to
enhance vemurafenib-mediated apoptosis and reduce survival in long-term colony formation
assays (Figures 5C,D). The enhanced proapoptotic effects of combined BRAF/PI3K
inhibition were PTEN dependent and were not observed in WM164 cells that are
BRAF6000E/PTEN+ (Figure 5E). Liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass
spectrometry (LC-MRM) was next used to identify the BH3 family proteins required for
15 24
FN-mediated survival (Figure 5F, Supplemental Figure 15A) , . These studies showed
Mcl-1 expression to be dependent upon signaling through α5 integrin and FN, with siRNA
knockdown of either of these proteins decreasing Mcl-1 expression when BRAF was
inhibited (Figures 5F-H, Supplemental Figure 15A). In line with FN being a stress-induced
response in PTEN- cells, the expression of FN was upregulated in serum-starvation
transfection conditions and in the presence of lipofectamine (Figure 5H, Supplemental
Figure 15B). The adhesion-mediated Mcl-1 expression was also dependent upon PI3K/AKT
signaling with expression being reduced following treatment with the combination of
vemurafenib and GDC0941 (Figure 5I).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Melanoma cells readily adapt to nearly every treatment intervention and possess multiple
routes to therapeutic escape. Understanding of the process of adaptation and resistance has
been complicated by the diversity of signaling in melanoma and the ability of subtle
alterations in levels of signaling molecules and RTKs to reduce sensitivity to BRAF and
MEK inhibitors (e.g. cyclin D1, COT, BRAF, CRAF, MEK1 mutations, PDGFR, IGF1R)
25 26
(reviewed in , ). In the current study, we used massspectrometry based phosphoproteomic
analysis to identify a novel mechanism by which BRAF inhibition remodels the extracellular
environment of melanoma cells and stimulating signaling through integrins, allowing for
therapeutic escape. Proteomic analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling a panel of BRAF6000E/
PTEN-melanoma cell lines demonstrated vemurafenib to induce signaling through proteins
implicated in EMT, including α5β1 integrin, FN, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, paxillin,
27
and talin . Previous mass spectrometry work, in which one BRAF mutant melanoma cell
line was treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, has already demonstrated a role for
28
oncogenic BRAF in cytoskeletal regulation . EMT has been best characterized in the
oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells, where it is typified by increased motility,
27 29
upregulated expression of ECM (such as FN), apoptosis resistance and drug resistance , .
Although melanocytes are neural crest-derived and not epithelial in origin, the introduction

of mutant BRAF can lead to an EMT-like state - . We here provide evidence that
inhibition of BRAF also induces an EMT-like phenotype in melanoma cells that lack PTEN
expression. Loss of PTEN/increased AKT signaling mediates a mesenchymal switch in
33 35
multiple epithelial tumor types including prostate cancer and nasopharyngeal tumors - .
In BRAF6000E/PTEN- melanoma cells, the vemurafenib-induced EMT was characterized by
increased FN/α5β1 integrin signaling. These observations were not restricted to vemurafenib
and could be recapitulated through cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. Other cancer-relevant
forms of stress, such as mild acidosis (pH 6.7) also increased FN expression in this system.
These findings mirror those seen in breast cancer patients, where resistance to multiple
drugs; including chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, cisplatin), signal transduction
inhibitors (PI3K, MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors) and RTK inhibitors (EGFR, HER3
29
inhibitors) was associated with a switch to a more mesenchymal phenotype . A link
between loss of PTEN and increased FN deposition has been observed in other systems and
is characteristic of pathological fibrotic states such as pulmonary fibrosis, where PTEN
36 37
downregulation in infiltrating fibroblasts leads to increased FN deposition , . Evaluation
of a melanoma TMA demonstrated the role of PTEN loss as a negative prognostic factor
with a significant correlation observed between decreased PTEN expression and worse
overall survival. When FN expression was included in the survival analysis, patients whose
tumors lacked PTEN and expressed high FN showed a poorer survival than those with
tumors that retained PTEN and lacked FN expression (15.1 vs. 45.2 months, median OS).

Attachment to extracellular matrix has been identified as an important mechanism of drug
resistance in a number of tumor systems. In myeloma, β1-integrin-mediated adhesion serves
38
to increase STAT3 signaling leading to increased Bcl-XL and decreased BIM expression .
Protection from cytotoxic drugs has also been observed when lung cancer and ovarian
39 40
cancer cells are adhered onto laminin and collagen , . In a 3D cell culture model of
ovarian cancer, adhesion to reconstituted basement membrane mediated resistance to PI3K/
41
mTOR inhibition . Use of a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) system revealed this
matrix-driven protection to be mediated through increased EGFR, IGFR1 and c-KIT activity,
leading to the suppression of apoptosis. The increase in cell survival was dependent upon
enhanced Bcl-2 protein expression and could be overcome through the combination of a
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and a Bcl-2 protein inhibitor or a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combined
41
with an EGFR or IGF1R inhibitor .

In tissue culture studies, the induction of integrin/FN signaling limited the cytotoxic effects
of vemurafenib. Mechanistically, integrin α5 signaling was required for the maintenance of
Mcl-1 expression, a key anti-apoptotic protein that exerts its effects through binding to
42 43
BIM-EL and inhibition of pro-apoptotic Bak/Bax , . In melanoma cells, adhesion to
44
fibronectin prevents the induction of anoikis through increased PI3K signaling . The
expression of Mcl-1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by PI3K/AKT and posttranslationally by MEK-mediated phosphorylation events that prevents its proteasomal
42 45
degradation , . A role for the PI3K/AKT pathway in the integrin-mediated maintenance
of Mcl-1 levels was suggested by the decreased AKT signaling seen following the siRNA
knockdown of FN and the ability of the BRAF/PI3K inhibitor combination to downregulate
Mcl-1 expression. The role of PI3K/AKT signaling in the adaptive responses that drive

therapeutic escape was suggested by the finding that the BRAF/PI3K inhibitor combination
led to increased cytotoxicity.
The observation that anti-cancer therapies induce the establishment of a pro-survival niche
that allows for therapeutic escape is not without precedent. There is evidence from mouse
xenograft studies that although radiation treatment induces massive cell death in tumors, it
also generates signals that promote the survival of small numbers of tumor cells that can
ultimately repopulate the tumor. In this instance, radiation-mediated apoptotic cell death led
to caspase-3 dependent expression of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which limited
46
cytotoxicity . The importance of caspase-3 in this process was demonstrated by studies
showing that animals deficient in this enzyme showed enhanced responses to radiation
therapy. Supporting studies in human cancer patients further demonstrated that high levels of
46
intratumoral caspase-3 predicted for an increased rate of cancer recurrence .

Author Manuscript

The ability of the tumor cells to adapt to therapy and provide a sanctuary for some of its own
cells is likely to be of major clinical significance given that even one melanoma cell can
47
establish new tumors in vivo . Together, our data demonstrate a role for the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway as the major mediator of adhesionmediated protection. A number of
clinical trials are now ongoing to determine whether the dual targeting of BRAF and
PI3K/AKT can abrogate or delay the onset of resistance in BRAF mutant melanoma patients
(NCT01902173, NCT01820364, NCT01616199).

Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cells were grown in 6 well tissue culture plates overnight, then treated with vehicle (DMSO)
3 μM vemurafenib, 3 μM GDC-0941, or the two drugs in combination for 72 hours. In some
studies, cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA or siRNAs targeting fibronectin,
integrin α5, or integrin β1 for 24 hours prior to treatment and harvested after 48 or 72 hours
of treatment. Cells were then washed with 1x Annexin V Binding Buffer (BD, San Jose,
CA), resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 2 μl APC-conjugated Annexin V
(550474, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 25 nmol/L tetramethylrhodamine, methyl
ester, perchlorate (TMRM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were incubated at 37°C
for 15 min before being analyzed for Annexin V fluorescence and TMRM retention using
flow cytometry. Gates were delineated based on regions of distinct populations.
LC-MRM
24 51

LC-MRM was performed as described previously , . Protein expression was determined
using the ratio of peak area of the endogenous peptide to corresponding internal standard;
normalization of results was performed using GAPDH to accommodate differences in total
protein loading. Data were then normalized to the non-targeting siRNA controls and graphed
to show the changes in expression after transfection and drug treatment.
Colony Formation

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded out into six-well plates at 1 × 104 per well and grown overnight before
being treated with vehicle, 3 μM vemurafenib, 3 μM GDC-0941, or the two drugs in
combination. Cells were left to grow for 2 weeks with new drug added twice per week.
Wells were washed with PBS and stained with crystal violet solution (50% methanol + 50%
H2O + 0.5% crystal violet).
TMA and patient specimens

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical staining of melanoma specimens and a tissue microarray (TMA)
containing a spectrum of melanoma specimens was constructed and analyzed under
approved protocols by the Institutional Review Board at the University of South Florida
(including informed consent). It contained samples from four groups: primary cutaneous
melanoma, lymph node metastases, dermal/subcutaneous metastases, and visceral
metastases. After identification of tumor tissue, two 1.5 mm cores were obtained from each
donor block. For the TMA, a single core from each block was positioned on a grid of 100
samples processed with the Beecher Microarray System. Targeted gene sequencing was
performed on extracted DNA from the second core, and analyzed via the Sequenom
platform (MassARRAY Analyzer 4 and Melacarta™ Panel). Clinical data was collected on
the patients. Medical records and the social security death index were searched for
demographic, pathology, staging and recurrence/survival data. Analyses were performed
using SPSS and SAS software. TMA sections were evaluated for total FN and PTEN
expression via IHC with optimized anti-FN (ab2413, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and anti-

PTEN (E4250, Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA) antibodies in the Tissue Core at Moffitt
Cancer Center. TMA was stained using a Ventana Discovery XT automated system (Ventana
Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) following manufacturer's protocol with proprietary reagents.
Detection was carried out using the Ventana ChromoMap Red kit with Hematoxylin
counterstain. Staining intensity was scored by the dermatopathologist as follows: absent
staining=0, weak staining=1, moderate staining=2, strong staining =3. For both markers, all
tumor cells in the infiltrate showed diffuse, uniform staining. Dichotomous high and low FN
levels were assigned based on IHC scores of 0-1 and 2-3, respectively. PTEN dichotomous
scoring was assigned as absent (IHC=0) versus present (IHC=1-3).
Cell Adhesion Assay

Author Manuscript

1205Lu melanoma cells were plated onto 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight.
They were then treated for 72 hours with 3μM vemurafenib. Following the treatment, the
cells were detached using 10mM EDTA in PBS. The plates were incubated overnight with
5% acetic acid at 4°C. Plates were then washed three times with PBS. These vemurefenibinduced FN plates were compared to regular plastic cell culture plates, and commercially
available FN-coated plates from BD (San Jose, CA ). 1205Lu cells were plated onto these
plates and monitored for cell attachment after a 15-minute incubation period. The cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Cells were imaged, and 9
frames from each surface was used for cell counts
Densitometry
The mean pixel intensity for each band and the background was determined. The
background was subtracted from each sample and the resulting value was divided by the
appropriate control.

A: (left) Kinome array demonstrating that FN knockdown attenuates vemurafenib mediated
AKT signaling (3 μM, 8 hrs.). (right) Quantification of pAKT densitometry on the kinome
array B: Western blot confirmation of the kinome array from A demonstrating that FN
knockdown prevents adaptive AKT signaling following BRAF inhibition (3 μM, 8 hrs.).
pAKT was quantified using densitometry. C: Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling in
combination with BRAF inhibition enhances cytotoxicity. Treatment with vemurafenib (3
μM) + GDC-0941 (3 μM) induces significantly more apoptosis compared to either inhibitor
25 alone. Cells were treated with the stated drug combinations for 48 hrs followed by
Annexin-V/TMRM staining and flow cytometry. D: Combined BRAF/PI3K inhibition is
associated with prolonged suppression of growth of BRAF6000E/PTEN- melanoma cell lines.
Cells were treated with 3 μM vemurafenib and 3 μM GDC-0941 for 2 weeks. Colonies were
visualized following staining with crystal violet. E: Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling in
combination with BRAF inhibition does not enhance cytotoxicity in PTEN+ WM164 cells
compared to PTEN- 1205Lu. Cells were treated with the stated drug combinations for 48
hrs. followed by Annexin-V/TMRM staining and flow cytometry. F: α5 integrin is required
for maintenance of Mcl-1 expression following BRAF inhibition. LC-MRM experiment

showing the relative fold changes in 11 BH3 only family proteins following siRNA
knockdown of α5 integrin +/− 3 μM vemurafenib treatment in 1205Lu cell line, green
indicating a decrease in expression and red indicating an increase in expression. G: Western
blot showing siRNA knockdown of integrin α5 and β1 to be critical for the regulation of
Mcl-1 expression in 1205Lu cell line. H: Induction of fibronectin regulates Mcl-1
expression. siRNA knockdown of FN is associated with decreased Mcl-1 expression
following 3 μM vemurafenib treatment (72 hours) in 1205Lu cell line. I: Combined
treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor downregulates Mcl-1 expression. Cells were
treated with either 3 μM vemurafenib or 3 μM PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) for 72 hours
followed by Western blotting for Mcl-1.
