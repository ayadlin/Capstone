BACKGROUND: Enzastaurin and bevacizumab have demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects and, in phase 1 studies, the combination was well tolerated. This phase 2 study assessed enzastaurin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus
bevacizumab as maintenance therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). METHODS: Patients with locally
advanced or MCRC and stable or responding disease after completing 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy randomly
received a loading dose of enzastaurin 1125 mg, followed by 500 mg/d subsequent doses or placebo. Both arms
received 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (leucovorin 400 mg/m2 intravenously [IV], 5-fluorouracil 400-mg/m2 bolus, 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 IV) plus bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV, every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free
survival (PFS), from randomization. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were also assessed from start of first-line therapy.
Enrollment was stopped, and the final analysis was conducted after 73 PFS events. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients
were randomized to enzastaurin and 59 to placebo. For the enzastaurin and placebo arms, respectively, the median
cycles received were 9 and 10, and the median PFS was 5.8 and 8.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.84-2.16; P ¼ .896). Median OS was not calculable because of high censoring (77.6% enzastaurin; 91.5%
placebo). The median PFS from start of first-line therapy was 8.9 months for enzastaurin and 11.3 months for placebo
(HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.86-2.23; P ¼ .913). More enzastaurin patients developed thrombosis or embolism compared with
placebo (15.8% and 1.7%; P ¼ .008). One possibly enzastaurin-related death occurred because of arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Enzastaurin combined with bevacizumab-based therapy is tolerable, but does not improve PFS
during maintenance therapy in patients with MCRC compared with bevacizumab-based therapy alone. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer globally for both men and women, accounting for 9%
of all cancer deaths in the United States.1 Approximately 25% of patients present with metastatic disease, and almost 50%
of patients initially treated for localized disease develop metastatic CRC.2

Enzastaurin in Colorectal Cancer/Wolff et al

Historically, 5-fluorouracil, modulated by leucovorin, has been the mainstay of treatment in metastatic
CRC.3,4 Standard first-line therapies consist of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combined with either oxaliplatin
(FOLFOX)5-7 or irinotecan (FOLFIRI).8,9 The addition
of targeted agents such as bevacizumab, a humanized
monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), to standard combinations for the
treatment of metastatic CRC has further enhanced the
outcomes obtained with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.10-12
Maintenance therapy is intended to maximize progression-free survival (PFS) and minimize toxicity in
advanced CRC.13 Until recently, common clinical practice was to continue first-line treatment for patients with
CRC until progression; however, toxicity was reported
after multiple cycles of therapy.7 Thus, delivery of maintenance therapy was introduced using a standard regimen,
such as FOLFOX, while discontinuing the drug in that
regimen responsible for cumulative toxicity, such as oxaliplatin, after 6 cycles (12 weeks) of first-line induction
therapy. For example, Chibaudel et al13 studied the role of
maintenance therapy by delivering induction chemotherapy consisting of 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 and then randomizing patients without disease progression to undergo a
chemotherapy-free interval until progression, or to receive
maintenance therapy consisting of bolus 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin and infusional 5-fluorouracil (LV5FU2).
Patients randomized to maintenance LV5FU2 had a longer duration of disease control, longer PFS, and a trend
toward improved overall survival (OS) compared with
patients randomized to undergo a chemotherapy-free
interval until progression.13 The current study was therefore designed to investigate the potential benefit of adding
another novel molecular agent to a regimen of maintenance therapy consisting of LV5FU2 and bevacizumab.
Enzastaurin is an oral serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that suppresses signaling through the protein kinase C
(PKC) b and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathways.14 It inhibits phosphorylation of downstream signal
proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3b, suppressing tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, and promoting
apoptosis. Enzastaurin is highly selective for PKCb, with
an inhibition constant of approximately 6 nM. It targets
both tumor and endothelial cells to inhibit tumorinduced angiogenesis by suppressing expression of and
responses to VEGF. Preclinical and phase 1 studies demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects when enzastaurin
was combined with bevacizumab.15

This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial
was conducted to assess if adding enzastaurin to the combination of LV5FU2 and bevacizumab as a maintenance
therapy would delay progression of advanced/metastatic
CRC in patients with objective response or stable disease
(SD) after first-line therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients were at least 18 years of age with a histologic diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic CRC (excluding
neuroendocrine carcinoma) that was not amenable to curative therapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0, 1, or 2; and adequate organ function. Patients must have had documented evidence (confirmation not required) of tumor response or SD by
computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging after 6 cycles (3 months [12 weeks]) of first-line therapy with standard bi-weekly regimens of FOLFOX5-7 or
FOLFIRI8,9 plus bevacizumab for metastatic CRC or
recurrent CRC that had relapsed at least 12 months after
completion of adjuvant therapy. Prior radiotherapy must
have been completed 30 days before beginning first-line
therapy, and no more than 4 weeks may have passed
between the end of first-line therapy (day 14 of cycle 6)
and randomization. Reasons for exclusion included serious cardiac conditions; central nervous system metastases;
inadequately controlled hypertension; proteinuria; or history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or
intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before the
study.
The study was approved by ethical/institutional
review boards and was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practices. All
patients provided signed informed consent.
Study Design and Treatment Plan
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase 2
study, patients with stable or responding disease after 6
cycles of induction therapy for metastatic CRC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive maintenance therapy of either enzastaurin plus LV5FU2 and bevacizumab
(enzastaurin arm) or placebo plus LV5FU2 and bevacizumab (placebo arm). The primary objective was to compare PFS from the time of randomization between the
maintenance treatment arms. Secondary objectives were
to compare OS from the time of randomization, to

4133

Original Article

compare PFS and OS from the start of first-line therapy,
and to assess safety and adverse event (AE) profiles.
Assignment to treatment groups was determined by
a computer-generated random sequence using an Interactive Voice Response System. Randomization was stratified
for the following prognostic factors at baseline using the
blocked randomization method: prior adjuvant therapy
(no vs yes) and response to first-line treatment (complete
response or partial response vs SD).
In the enzastaurin arm, a loading dose (on day 1 of
cycle 1) of enzastaurin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) 1125 mg/d was given (30 minutes after a meal)
orally (three 125-mg tablets 3 daily) followed by subsequent doses of 500 mg/d orally (two 125-mg tablets 2
daily). In the placebo arm, placebo was given orally 3
daily (as 3 tablets) on day 1 of cycle 1 followed by subsequent doses given orally 2 times daily (as 2 tablets). Both
arms received LV5FU2 plus bevacizumab (Genentech/
Roche, South San Francisco, Calif) on day 1 of each cycle
(2 weeks): leucovorin 400 mg/m2 intravenously (IV),
then 5-fluorouracil 400-mg/m2 bolus followed by 2400
mg/m2 IV over 46 hours, and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV.
Maintenance treatment continued until the occurrence of
progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.
Enzastaurin doses were not reduced or omitted for
laboratory hematologic toxicity that was clearly attributable to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or bevacizumab therapy,
with the exception of elevated liver transaminases and febrile neutropenia. Any unusual or unexpected AEs that
occurred that were above and beyond the expected safety
profile of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus bevacizumab
combination therapy required omission of enzastaurin
until the event resolved. After the event resolved to grade
1 or baseline, patients were restarted on enzastaurin 250
mg daily.
Baseline and Treatment Assessments
Efficacy analyses were conducted on all randomized
patients; safety analyses were conducted on all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of enzastaurin/
placebo, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, or bevacizumab. Disease assessment was made every 6 weeks (that is, after every 3 cycles of treatment) using a modified version of
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.16 PFS was
defined as the time from the date of randomization (primary objective) or from the start of first-line therapy to
the first date of objectively determined PD, clinical progression (defined as global deterioration of health status
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective

4134

evidence of progression), or death. OS was defined as the
time from the date of randomization or from the start of
first-line therapy to the date of death. Toxicity was
assessed at each cycle using the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 3.0.
Statistical Considerations
The purpose of this phase 2 study was to detect an
improvement in PFS with the addition of enzastaurin to
5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus bevacizumab, not to rigorously demonstrate superiority. Originally, enrollment
of approximately 150 patients (75 patients per arm) was
planned, with the expectation of 118 PFS events for the
primary efficacy analysis. However, a decision was made
to perform an earlier evaluation of the primary endpoint
to assess the relevance of outcomes from additional
CRC studies, and the study was amended to perform
the primary efficacy analysis after at least 50 events of
clinical progression, objective progression, or death. At
this point, enrollment was stopped, the study treatment
assignment was unblinded, and the final analysis was
performed. The study was thus powered to detect a
36% improvement in PFS by showing a median PFS of
7.5 months for the enzastaurin arm. By using a log-rank
test, the study had at least 60% power to achieve statistical significance at a 1-sided level of .20, assuming at
least 50 PFS events at the final analysis and a true PFS
hazard ratio (HR) of the enzastaurin arm to the placebo
arm of .73.17
PFS and OS were compared between the 2 treatment arms using the log-rank test at the 1-sided significance level of .20. In addition, Kaplan-Meier
estimations18 were performed on the observed distributions of PFS and OS, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated. The Cox regression model19 was used to estimate
treatment group differences adjusted for prognostic factors. The incidences of selected AEs from the 2 treatment
arms were compared using the Fisher’s exact test at a 1sided significance level of .20.
In addition, an interim analysis was conducted to
assess the safety parameters of LV5FU2 plus bevacizumab with or without enzastaurin after 15 patients had
been randomized and completed at least 1 cycle of
study treatment. A post hoc power analysis was also
done to estimate the probability of the study’s success if
the primary efficacy analysis had been performed as
originally planned, that is, after achieving 118 PFS
events.20

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From March 7, 2008 to January 27, 2010, 123 patients
were entered into the study. Of the 123 patients, 117
patients were randomly assigned to receive enzastaurin
(58 patients) or placebo (59 patients; Table 1). Approximately 2=3 (64.1%) of the patients were male, with a median age of 64 years. Greater than 90% of patients
presented with stage IV disease.
Drug Administration
A total of 115 patients were treated, with 57 patients in
the enzastaurin arm and 58 patients in the placebo arm
completing at least 1 cycle of treatment. The median
number of cycles received was 9 (range, 1-36) in the enzastaurin arm and 10 (range, 2-37) in the placebo arm. A
total of 27 patients (47.4%) in the enzastaurin arm completed at least 10 cycles of treatment, as did 33 patients
(56.9%) in the placebo arm.

At least 1 dose reduction occurred because of AEs in
2 patients (3.5%) in the enzastaurin arm (AEs of diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting) and 2 patients (3.4%) in the placebo arm (AEs of diarrhea and dizziness). Eighteen
patients (31.6%) in the enzastaurin arm and 15 patients
(25.9%) in the placebo arm had at least 1 dose omission
because of an AE. AEs resulting in a dose omission that
occurred in >1 patient in either treatment arm included
diarrhea, dizziness, mucosal inflammation, fatigue, and
vomiting.

Efficacy
In the 117 patients randomized, there were 73 PFS events
(39 in the enzastaurin arm, 34 in the placebo arm) for the
primary efficacy analysis. The median PFS from randomization was 5.8 months in the enzastaurin arm and 8.1
months in the placebo arm (HR, 1.35; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.84-2.16; P ¼ .896; Fig. 1). Censoring
rates were 32.8% and 42.4% in the enzastaurin and placebo arms, respectively. No significant differences in treatment effect were found when PFS from randomization
was analyzed by subgroup (prior adjuvant therapy,
response to first-line therapy, and prior FOLFOX/FOLFIRI use).
The median PFS from the start of first-line therapy
was 8.9 months in the enzastaurin arm and 11.3 months
in the placebo arm (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.86-2.23; P ¼
.913). The median OS from randomization was not calculable because of high censoring rates of 77.6% and
91.5% for enzastaurin and placebo, respectively; 41
patients in the enzastaurin arm and 39 patients in the placebo arm had discontinued study treatment at the time of

Safety
Table 2 summarizes laboratory and nonlaboratory grade 3
and 4 AEs possibly related to study drug. Most AEs occurring during treatment within either arm were grade 1 or 2.
More patients developed thrombosis or embolism in the
enzastaurin arm than in the placebo arm: 15.8% (grade 3
to 4) and 1.7% (grade 4), respectively (P ¼ .008). Three
patients, all in the enzastaurin arm, received transfusions
while on study: 2 patients received packed red blood cells
(RBCs), and 1 patient received leukoreduced packed
RBCs.
Six patients in the enzastaurin arm discontinued
treatment because of drug-related serious AEs of diarrhea
and fatigue (in 2 patients each) and nausea and pulmonary
embolism (in 1 patient each). Two patients in the placebo
arm discontinued treatment because of drug-related AEs
of atrial fibrillation and chapped skin. One patient in the
enzastaurin arm died during the study (cycle 10) because
of possibly drug-related arrhythmia.

DISCUSSION
The role and timing of maintenance therapy remain
uncertain in the management of metastatic CRC. Previously, patients were administered standard first-line therapy of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI until progression; however,
because of cumulative toxicities, first-line induction ther-

4136

apy is now often given followed by complete treatment
cessation or by maintenance therapy with LV5FU2.7,13
In the current phase 2 study, patients received 6
cycles of induction FOLFOX or FOLFIRI followed by
maintenance treatment with the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin portion of the induction regimen combined with
the targeted agent bevacizumab and either enzastaurin
or placebo. Enrollment in the trial was stopped, the
study results were unblinded, and the final analysis was
conducted after 73 PFS events. The addition of enzastaurin to bevacizumab and LV5FU2 failed to improve
PFS compared with placebo as maintenance therapy.
On the basis of the observed data, the post hoc power
analysis showed that even if the study was analyzed after
achieving the originally planned 118 events, the probability of the study being successful would be very low
(2.8%).
It is noteworthy that the study has limited power
(60%) and a high type-I error rate (1-sided alpha ¼ .20),
thus the results of the study should be interpreted with
caution. Nevertheless, the clinically meaningful results in
favor of the placebo arm suggest that the termination of
further development of maintenance therapy with enzastaurin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and bevacizumab
was in the best interest of the patients.
Consistent with the current study, recent results of
other phase 2 studies have shown that enzastaurin does
not improve efficacy when combined with chemotherapy
and bevacizumab in nonsmall cell lung cancer.21 Activity

carcinoma, and no PFS benefit was demonstrated with
the combination of enzastaurin and capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer that progressed after anthracycline
treatment.22,23
The reasons for poor PFS in the enzastaurin arm
compared with placebo are uncertain. Because preclinical studies had demonstrated synergistic antitumor
effects when enzastaurin was combined with bevacizumab, it seems unlikely that this combination had a negative impact on tumor biology. It is possible that there
was a negative interaction between 5-fluorouracil and
enzastaurin, which may have compromised the antitumor effect of leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and bevacizumab, although no findings currently support that
hypothesis. Alternatively, the dual inhibition of the
VEGF pathway achieved by combining bevacizumab
with enzastaurin to abrogate downstream signaling
may have caused more robust compensatory up-regulation of other angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast
growth factor, placental growth factor, or hepatocyte
growth factor.24 However, the results of this underpowered study do not support any clear conclusions
regarding these hypotheses. In addition, because of the
high rate of censoring, the median OS was not
calculable.
Although this study of maintenance therapy with
enzastaurin did not demonstrate efficacy, maintenance
with other compounds has shown promise. Bevacizumab has been shown to improve efficacy when added
to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin10,25 or irinotecan.11,12 Additional trials on the optimal duration
of chemotherapy plus targeted agents are ongoing, such
as OPTIMOX3 (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil with
oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab
and erlotinib)26 and CAIRO3 (oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab plus
capecitabine or observation).27 The outcome of these
ongoing trials may provide guidance on the future
direction for the study of maintenance therapy in CRC
treatment.
In conclusion, although the regimen was tolerable,
further development of maintenance therapy with enzastaurin plus LV5FU2 and bevacizumab is not recommended for metastatic CRC based on the results of the
current study. Nevertheless, maintenance therapy with
other compounds in metastatic CRC is feasible and
deserves further study as a means to prolong PFS, decrease
toxicity, and ultimately improve survival and enhance
quality of life. The current trial design (with a robust sam-

agents.
