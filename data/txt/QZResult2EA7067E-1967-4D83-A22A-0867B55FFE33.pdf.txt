ABSTRACT
Acquired mutations in KIT are driver mutations in systemic mastocytosis (SM).
Here, we tested the role of SHP2/PTPN11 phosphatase in oncogenic KIT signaling
using an aggressive SM mouse model. Stable knock-down (KD) of SHP2 led to
impaired growth, colony formation, and increased rates of apoptosis in P815 cells.
This correlated with defects in signaling to ERK/Bim, Btk, Lyn, and Stat5 pathways
in P815-KD cells compared to non-targeting (NT). Retro-orbital injections of P815
NT cells in syngeneic DBA/2 mice resulted in rapid development of aggressive SM
within 13-16 days characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and
multifocal liver tumors. In contrast, mice injected with P815 SHP2 KD cells showed
less disease burden, including normal spleen weight and cellularity, and significant
reductions in mastocytoma cells in spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and liver
compared to NT controls. Treatment of human mast cell leukemia HMC-1 cells or
P815 cells with SHP2 inhibitor II-B08, resulted in reduced colony formation and cell
viability. Combining II-B08 with multi-kinase inhibitor Dasatinib showed enhanced
efficacy than either inhibitor alone in blocking cell growth pathways and cell viability.
Taken together, these results identify SHP2 as a key effector of oncogenic KIT and a
therapeutic target in aggressive SM.

INTRODUCTION

SCF-independent manner [6]. Studies in mice suggest
that the KIT D816V allele is a driver mutation in these
cancers since expression of KITD816V, or the analogous
mutation in mice (KITD814V), within hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) leads to myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in
mice [7, 8]. Recently, transgenic mice expressing KITD814V
in HSCs were shown to develop an aggressive SM at
an early age, while expression in mature mast cells led
to similar disease, but with delayed onset [9]. Although
KIT inhibitors such as Imatinib are effective for KIT
juxtamembrane mutations frequent in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, Imatinib fails to bind and inhibit KIT
D816V kinase [10-12]. This has led to identification of
more effective inhibitors of KITD816V kinase activity and

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare disease
characterized by expansion of malignant mast cells in
bone marrow, skin, spleen, gastrointestinal tract and
liver [1]. Subtypes of SM include indolent SM (ISM),
aggressive SM (ASM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL),
and these cancers are frequently associated with activating
mutations in KIT receptor. For example, the KIT D816V
mutation is found in 90% cases of in adults with SM,
but is also detected at lower frequency in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and testicular carcinoma [1-5]. Unlike
wild-type KIT that requires binding of its ligand Stem
Cell Factor (SCF) for activation, KITD816V signals in an

SM cell growth though met with limited success probably
due to associated mutations in other genes as well [5, 1216]. Consistently, other broad spectrum kinase inhibitors
such as Dasatinib show promise in vitro, but have yielded
disappointing results for treating SM patients [17].
Consistent with evidence with other targeted therapies, it
is evident that resistance to KIT inhibitors develops via
activation of downstream pathways driven by Ras, Lyn,
Btk and Stat5 [18-20]. With the identification of other
druggable targets within the oncogenic KIT pathway, it
is hoped that new combination therapies may prove more
effective in treating SM.
SHP2 (also called PTPN11) is a tyrosine
phosphatase that participates in a diverse array of signaling
pathways, and is critical for survival of trophoblast stem
cells, HSCs, metabolic control, cardiac and muscle
development, and connective tissue mast cell homeostasis
[21-25]. SHP2 is composed of two SH2 domains, a
PTP domain, and a C-terminal domain with two sites
of tyrosine phosphorylation. The activity of SHP2 is
tightly controlled by intramolecular interactions between
N-SH2 and PTP domains, which can be overcome by
SH2 interactions with tyrosine phosphorylated ligands
[26]. In mast cells, SCF-induced KIT activation leads to
recruitment of SHP2 to the juxtamembrane domain of KIT
via the adaptor protein Gab2 [27]. In bone marrow-derived
mast cells, SHP2 promotes KIT signaling to cell survival
and proliferation pathways [22, 27]. Recent studies have
also implicated SHP2 in playing a key role in oncogenic
KIT signaling in a variety of cell types. In spi-1 transgenic
mice, leukemic proerythroblasts with KITD814Y (or D818Y)
signal via SHP2 to enhance cell survival in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo [28, 29]. In both erythroblast and mast cell
leukemia cell lines, SHP2 silencing led to reduced Ras/
MEK/ERK pathway activation, upregulation of Bim, and
apoptosis [28, 29], which was consistent with our results
in SHP2 knock-out (KO) mast cells [22]. In a KITD814Vdriven MPD model, SHP2 KO impaired transformation of
bone marrow progenitors, and a small molecule inhibitor
of SHP2 (II-B08) [30] was shown to synergize with
a PI3K inhibitor to repress mast cell leukemia in MPD
mice [31]. Together, these studies identify SHP2 as a key
mediator of wild-type KIT and oncogenic KIT signaling
pathways. Given the frequency of KIT mutations in SM,
further testing of SHP2 as a druggable target is certainly
warranted for this disease.
Here, we report that SHP2 silencing in P815 mouse
mastocytoma cell line harboring KITD814Y mutation results
in impaired signaling to ERK, Btk, Lyn and STAT5
pathways, and reduced rates of cell growth and colony
formation. SHP2 knock-down (KD) cells were also
more susceptible to apoptosis induced by KIT inhibitor
treatment, and showed reduced Bim phosphorylation. In
syngeneic mice injected with P815 control or SHP2 KD
cells, the development of aggressive SM disease in bone
marrow, spleen and liver was significantly reduced with

SHP2 silencing. SHP2 inhibitor II-B08, when combined
with Dasatinib, prevented oncogenic KIT signaling and
cell growth in human and mouse mastocytoma models in
vitro.

RESULTS
SHP2 promotes proliferation and colony
formation in KITD814Y driven mastocytoma cells
To study the function of SHP2 in KIT-driven SM,
we transduced P815 mouse mastocytoma cell line that
expresses KITD814Y, with either a non-targeting (NT)
shRNA or two separate shRNAs against mouse SHP2.
Puromycin resistant cells were pooled together, and SHP2
levels were assessed by immunoblot (IB). Compared
to P815-NT cells, we observed a 50-60% reduction
in SHP2 levels in KD1 and KD2 cell lysates (Fig. 1A;
ERK served as a loading control). To test whether SHP2
KD altered key pathways downstream of KITD814Y, IB
analyses were performed using a panel of phosphospecific and control antibodies for several key mediators
of oncogenic KIT signaling. SHP2 KD cells showed
reduced phosphorylation of ERK compared to NT control
cells (Fig. 1A), and this is consistent with SHP2 silencing
in other KIT-driven cancer models [28, 29, 31]. We also
observed a similar reduction in Btk autophosphorylation
(Y223) in SHP2 KD cells and increased phosphorylation
of the C-terminal inhibitory site (Y507) in Lyn kinase
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, both Lyn and Btk are implicated
in cell growth and survival in human SM models [18].
Increased Lyn pY507 in SHP2 KD cells is consistent with
SHP2-dependent dephosphorylation of this inhibitory site
downstream of the G-CSF receptor [32], and oncogenic
KIT receptor. We also examined Stat5 phosphorylation
since it is linked to oncogenic KIT signaling [12], and
SHP2 promotes Stat5 activation downstream of FLT3ITD in AML cells [33]. Indeed, Stat5 phosphorylation was
reduced in SHP2 KD cells compared to control (Fig. 1A).
Defects in ERK activation in a variety SHP2-deficient
cell models leads to reductions in phosphorylation
and proteosomal degradation of the proapoptotic Bim
protein [22, 25, 29]. In P815-KD cells, we also observed
reduced Bim phosphorylation and increased BimEL levels
compared to NT control (Fig. 1A). Together, these results
implicate SHP2 in promoting signaling to growth and
survival pathways in P815 mastocytoma cells harboring
the KITD814Y driver mutation.
The effects of SHP2 silencing on P815 cell
proliferation was assessed in 2D cell culture conditions
and colony assays. Both P815-KD1 and -KD2 cell pools
showed a significant defect in cell growth rates compared
to P815-NT cells over a 3 day period (Fig. 1B). Since both
SHP2 shRNAs caused comparable defects in signaling
6131

and growth rates, we conclude that this is due to SHP2
downregulation and not off-target effects. Subsequent
assays were performed using a single P815-KD cell pool
(P815-KD2), which was most efficient in maintaining
SHP2 silencing with multiple cell passages (data not
shown). To test effects of SHP2 silencing on the malignant

phenotype of P815 cells, we measured mastocytoma
colony formation in semi-solid, methylcellulose media in
the absence of exogenous cytokines or colony-stimulating
factors. Within 8 days of plating in methylcellulose we
observed increased colony formation for P815-NT cells
compared to P815-KD cells (Fig. 1C). Quantification
of these results from multiple experiments revealed a
significant reduction in mastocytoma colony formation
with SHP2 silencing (Fig. 1D). Together, these results
identify SHP2 as a positive regulator of KITD814Y-driven
mastocytoma growth in 2D and 3D culture conditions.
	 Since SHP2 promotes survival signaling from
wild-type and oncogenic KIT [22, 25, 29], we tested for
effects of SHP2 silencing on KIT-dependent survival of
P815 cells using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry.
There was a small but significant increase in apoptotic
P815-KD cells compared to P815-NT cells with vehicle
alone (DMSO), and a more substantial increase following
treatment with a low dose (250 nM) of KIT inhibitor
SU11652 for 18 hours (Fig. 1E). These results support a
role for SHP2 in promoting survival signaling downstream
of oncogenic KIT receptor.

SHP2 silencing impairs development of aggressive
SM in mice
To test the role of SHP2 in progression of aggressive
SM in vivo, we employed a previously described model
involving injection of P815 cells in retro-orbital sinus of
syngeneic DBA/2 mice [34]. In this model, a rapid and
fatal expansion of SM occurs within weeks, characterized
by extensive infiltration of bone marrow (BM), spleen,
blood and liver, leading to splenomegaly and liver damage
[34]. We performed retro-orbital injections of DBA/2
mice with saline (sham), P815-NT or P815-KD cells.
Mice receiving P815-NT cells appeared moribund within
13 days, whereas those injected with P815-KD cells or
saline showed no overt phenotypes (data not shown). Mice
from all groups were sacrificed on day 13, and peripheral
blood and tissues harvested to monitor development of
SM. All mice injected with P815-NT cells developed
splenomegaly, whereas those injected with P815-KD
cells had only modest spleen enlargement compared to
sham controls (Fig. 2A, B). To analyze the effects on
splenic cellularity, single cell suspensions from spleens
were stained with antibodies to detect neutrophils (Gr1+/
CD11b+), macrophages (CD11b+Gr1-), B-lymphocytes
(CD11b-B220+), and mastocytoma cells (CD45+KIT+).
Subsequent analyses by flow cytometry revealed that
compared to sham controls, mice from P815-NT and P815KD groups showed increased populations of neutrophils
and monocytes, and reduced B lymphocytes (Fig. 2C).
Since spleen size and cellularity were also different
between groups, we compared absolute cell numbers,
and observed a pronounced increase in neutrophils and

monocytes in mice injected with P815-NT cells compared
to sham (Fig. 2D). In contrast, only a modest rise in these
populations was observed for P815-KD group compared
to sham (Fig. 2D). Both P815-NT and P815-KD groups
showed a trend towards reduced B220+ cells compared
to sham controls (Fig. 2D). Mastocytoma cells were also
detected in spleen by flow cytometry, with a significant
reduction in the P815-KD group compared to P815NT (Fig. 2E, F). These results demonstrate that SHP2
silencing lessens development of splenomegaly in mice
subjected to a model of aggressive SM.
Since BM infiltration was previously reported in
this SM model [34], we next analysed BM cellularity for
the sham, P815 NT and P815 KD groups. Compared to

sham mice, both P815-NT and P815-KD groups showed
reductions in immature myeloid cells (CD11b), neutrophils
(Gr1) and B cell progenitors (B220; Fig. 3A). This
correlated with a substantial population of mastocytoma
cells in BM for the P815-NT group, and to a lesser
extent for the P815-KD group (Fig. 3B; 25% and 5%,
respectively). Quantification of the mastocytoma burden
in BM for multiple experiments revealed a significant
reduction with SHP2 silencing (Fig. 3C). To verify that
SHP2 silencing was maintained in vivo, mastocytoma
cells were isolated from BM by selection with puromycin,
and were shown by IB to have retained silencing of SHP2
(data not shown).
To assess the systemic spread of mastocytoma in
DBA/2 mice injected with P815-NT or P815-KD cells,
peripheral blood was collected at day 13. After erythrocyte
lysis, peripheral blood neutrophils, monocytes, B cells
and mastocytoma cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Compared to sham, both P815-NT and P815-KD groups
showed elevated levels of monocytes (Fig. 4A). Although
no significant differences were associated with circulating
immune cells in P815-KD group, we did observe a
significant reduction in mastocytoma burden (Fig. 4B,
C). Together, these results are consistent with a protective
effect of SHP2 silencing on the progression of SM in mice.
Since the liver was previously shown to be a site
of P815 mastocytoma infiltration [34], we examined liver
weight and cellularity between sham, P815-NT and P815KD groups. Compared to sham controls, both P815-NT
and P815-KD groups showed evidence of hepatomegaly
(Fig. 5A). However, differences in liver weights between
P815-NT and P815-KD groups were not significant (Fig.

5A). However, macroscopic nodules were observed
on the surface of livers from the P815-NT group, but
not the P815-KD or sham groups (data not shown).
Furthermore, histological staining of liver sections from
these mice revealed mastocytoma tumor nodules with
clear, defined margins and an amorphous core (Fig. 5B,
top panel). Metastatic cells in these tumors were poorly
differentiated and the high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio
suggested high mitotic activity, which was confirmed by
immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 (Fig. 5B, lower
panel). In contrast, livers from mice injected with P815-

KD cells had only small cell aggregates resembling micrometastases that were positive for Ki67 (Fig. 5B, right
panels). However, no large tumors were detected in any of
the P815-KD group (data not shown). Quantification of the
mastocytoma burden in liver revealed a striking reduction
in tumor incidence for the P815-KD group compared to
P815 NT group (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results
implicate SHP2 in positively regulating progression of SM
to aggressive, metastatic disease.

SHP2 inhbitor II-B08 enhances the effects of
Dasatinib on human and mouse mastocytoma
cells

regulating cell growth and survival [35, 36]. To address
this, we investigated the effects of a SHP2 phosphatase
inhibitor (II-B08), which has shown anti-proliferative
effects in several cancer models [30, 31, 33]. We employed
the human mast cell leukemia cell line -1 (HMC-1) model,
which harbors KIT D816V and V560G mutations, and
depends on signaling from these constitutively active
KIT receptors for growth and survival [4]. HMC-1 cells
were allowed to grow in semisolid methyl cellulose
media devoid of any colony stimulating factors, but
supplemented with either DMSO or SHP2 inhibitor II-B08
(50 and 100 µM) for 8 days. We observed a dose dependent
reduction in colony formation with II-B08 compared to
DMSO control (Fig. 6A, B). These defects were likely
due to loss of HMC-1 cell viability upon treatment with
SHP2 inhibitor II-B08 as measured in Alamar blue
assays (Fig. 6C). Since only the highest dose caused a
substantial loss of viability, we considered combining
II-B08 with other inhibitors. Previous studies have
suggested that combination of drugs targeting different
points in oncogenic pathways can improve neoplastic
cell killing and the development of resistance [31, 37,
38]. To test whether SHP2 inhibitor could be effective in
combination with multi-kinase inhibitor Dasatinib (BMS354825), previously used in human mast cell leukemia
SM patients [16, 37, 39], we treated HMC-1 cells with an
IC50 dose of Dasatinib (50 nM) alone, or in combination
with two different doses of II-B08. As expected, Dasatinib
treatment alone caused approximately 50% reduction in
HMC-1 cell viability compared to DMSO control (Fig.
6D). Interestingly, combination treatments with Dasatinib
and II-B08 (50 µM) led to a significant improvement in
HMC-1 cell killing compared to Dasatinib alone (Fig.
6D). Importantly, we observed similar results with IIB08 treatment of P815 mouse mastocytoma cells in vitro,
and improved cell killing when combined with Dasatinib
(20 nM) alone (Fig. S1). To assess the effects of this new
combination treatment using II-B08 and Dasatinib on
key cell growth and survival signaling pathways, HMC-1
cells were treated with either DMSO, Dasatinib (5 nM),
II-B08 (50 µM) alone, or combined Dasatinib and II-B08
for 4h. Immunoblot analysis on cell lysates revealed that
II-B08 alone had no effect on activation of KIT (Fig. 6E).
While Dasatinib treatment impaired KIT phosphorylation
dramatically, downstream signaling to Erk and Stat5
pathways were less severely impaired (Fig. 6E). However,
combination treatments of Dasatinib and II-B08 caused
significant reductions in Erk and Stat5 activation, along
with increased inhibitory site phosphorylation of Lyn
(Figure 6 e). Together with our results implicating SHP2 in
promoting aggressive SM disease in mice, and the effects
of SHP2 inhibitor treatment in vitro, we conclude that
SHP2 inhibitors could be effective in combination with
kinase inhibitors such as Dasatinib for treating aggressive
SM.

Previous studies have identified both phosphataseindependent and phosphatase-dependent roles for SHP2 in

DISCUSSION

independent of KITD816V in resistant tumors [18-20]. A
recent study identifies combination treatments with multikinase inhibitors ponatinib and Dasatinib as more effective
in blocking KITD816V, Lyn, Stat5 and Btk signaling
pathways [38]. Another potential target investigated here
is SHP2 phosphatase, which has been identified as a
druggable target in a KITD814V-driven MPD mouse model
[31]. Here, we show that SHP2 promotes growth and
survival pathways in the P815 mouse mastocytoma model
that harbors a KITD814Y driver mutation. Silencing of SHP2
impaired activation of ERK, Stat5, Lyn and Btk signaling
pathways, and caused stabilization of the proapoptotic
protein Bim. SHP2 KD cells showed defects in cell
growth and increased apoptosis upon treatment with a
KIT inhibitor in vitro. In a syngeneic mouse model of SM,
SHP2 silencing led to a significantly reduced mastocytoma
tumor burden and reduced metastases in the liver. Recent
studies using SHP2 inhibitor II-B08 have provided

SM is an orphan disease with limited treatment
options, mostly limited to treating adverse side effects
of mediator release by neoplastic MCs [1]. Although
several multi-kinase inhibitors can inhibit KITD816Vdriven growth of neoplastic MCs in vitro (midostaurin,
ponatinib, sunitinib, Dasatinib), they have largely failed in
clinical trials [13, 37, 38, 40, 41]. A phase II clinical trial
of Dasatinib in patients with various myeloid disorders
including SM, showed only partial response rates in
SM (≈33%) associated with improved symptoms, but
failed for patients with KITD816V mutations [14, 42]. The
development of resistance to these kinase inhibitors also
complicates the treatment strategies for SM, including
emergence of other pathways (e.g. Stat5, Ras, SFKs,
Tec/Btk kinases) that promote proliferation and survival

evidence that SHP2 promotes proliferation and survival
of leukemic cells harboring KIT and FLT3 mutations
[31, 33]. We observed similar effects of II-B08 treatment
(10-100 µM) leading to reduced colony formation ability
of human and mouse mastocytoma cells (HMC-1 and
P815). However, the effects of II-B08 on viability of these
mastocytoma models were more pronounced when it was
combined with Dasatinib. Mechanistically, this correlated
with improved disruption of key cell growth and survival
pathways (Erk, Stat5, Lyn) in Dasatinib/II-B08 treated
HMC-1 cells compared to either drug alone. Overall, this
study identifies SHP2 as a therapeutic target in aggressive
SM which frequently harbor activating KIT mutations,
and also provides further support for combining SHP2 and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in other relevant cancer models.
Several previous studies have implicated SHP2
in promoting wild-type KIT signaling to the Ras/ERK
pathway leading to enhanced proliferation and survival
of mature MCs [22, 27]. SHP2 also promotes activation
of Lyn kinase and Stat5 pathways [31, 32], that are
implicated in mechanisms to escape KIT inhibitor
treatments [38]. In the current study, we also show that
SHP2 promotes activation of Btk, which together with
Lyn, can allow human MC leukemia cells to escape the
effects of KIT inhibitors [18]. Thus, SHP2 inhibitors may
be effective in targeting these resistant SM tumors, or
more likely to be used in combination with multi-kinase
inhibitors. In KITD814V-driven MPD models, combination
treatment with SHP2 and PI3K inhibitors was much more
effective than single agent therapies [31]. Consistently,
in this study we show that killing of mouse mastocytoma
or human mast cell leukemia cells by submaximal doses
of Dasatinib, is improved upon the addition of SHP2
inhibitor II-B08 in in vitro assays. The rapid development
of ASM in the syngeneic model used here, should allow
for future testing of existing or new SHP2 inhibitors in
single or combination therapies in future
To fully understand the contributions of SHP2 to
SM progression in vivo, the potential contribution of
SHP2 to the homing of neoplastic MCs to various organs
should be investigated. This is partly due to a recent study
showing that SHP2 KO HSCs are defective in homing
to BM in irradiated mice [24]. Thus, the more dramatic
defects of SHP2 silencing that we observed in the in
vivo model compared to the in vitro assays, may reflect
contributions of SHP2 to both growth/survival signaling
and homing of mastocytoma cells. Another possible
explanation comes from a recent study implicating SHP2
in maintaining a pool of breast tumor-initiating cells via a
c-Myc/ZEB1-dependent gene expression signature [43]. It
will be interesting to test for involvement of this putative
SHP2 gene signature in the context of mastocytoma
tumor-initiating cells and potential mastocytoma stem cell
populations. In addition, the recent description of a Cre/
LoxP system that controls KITD814V expression [9] will
allow for coordinated KITD814V expression and SHP2 KO
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

using these transgenic mouse models. We previously used
Mcpt5-Cre to generate MC-specific SHP2 KO mice, and
observed a significant loss of connective tissue MCs [22].
Given that bitransgenic Mcpt5-Cre:KITD814V mice develop
SM [9], it will be interesting to test the effects of SHP2
KO on disease onset, and progression in this model. This
transgenic model can also be employed for further testing
of combination treatments with SHP2 and KIT inhibitors
in vivo.
In conclusion, our study identifies SHP2 as a
vital effector of oncogenic KIT signaling in a model
of aggressive SM. Further, we demonstrate that SHP2
inhibitors can be effective in combination with multikinase inhibitor Dasatinib in killing human and mouse
mastocytoma cells in vitro. Future testing of SHP2
inhibitors, including novel inhibitors with lower IC50
values, will undoubtedly spur further testing of multi-class
inhibitors against oncogenic kinases and phosphatases for
the treatment of aggressive SM and other cancers.

Lentiviral transduction of P815 cells

using an automated cell counter (Beckman Coulter Z2
particle analyzer). For colony formation assays, P815NT and P815-KD2 (2 x 104) cells were suspended in
MethoCult media (M3231; Stem Cell Technologies)
and plated in a 35 mm sterile tissue culture plate as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Colonies were manually
counted after 8 days by phase contrast microscopy (Nikon
Eclipse TS 100 light microscope). For inhibitor studies,
HMC-1 or P815 (2 X 104) cell were plated with DMSO or
II-B08 with indicated concentrations with further addition
of same doses at 72 h to maintain inhibitor concentration
throughout experiments. Images were acquired and
colonies were counted at day 8. P815-NT and P815-KD2
were incubated with DMSO or SU11652 (250 nM) for 18
hours, stained with FITC-AnnexinV and propidium iodide
(PI). Apoptotic cells were identified as AnnexinV+PI- cells
by flow cytometry (gating was based on unstained cells).

(NT) shRNA control from Open Biosystems. Lentiviral
production and transduction were performed as previously
described [22]. Briefly, lentiviral supernatants prepared
with shRNA against SHP2 and NT control were incubated
with P815 cells for 48 h and followed by selection with
puromycin (500 ng/ml) for 5 days. Stable cell pools
were screened for the most effective shRNAs clones via
subjecting lysates from repeated passages to immunoblot
(IB) analysis.

Cell viability assays

Mouse model of aggressive SM

P815 cells or HMC-1 cells (1X104 /well) were
incubated with DMSO or IIB 08 (20-100 µM) alone or in
combination with Dasatinib with indicated concentrations
for 72 h in a 96 well plate. Alamar blue dye (10 µL)
was added to each well for 2 h prior to analysis using
a spectrophotometer as described previously [22]. All
optical density (OD) readings were normalized against that
of DMSO treated P815 cells or HMC-1 cells. To calculate
percent viable cells, a standard curve was included with
known cell numbers for either P815 or HMC-1 cells at
time the time of Alamar blue addition.

P815-NT, -KD1 and -KD2 (5 x 106) cells were plated
in serum free DMEM for 2 h followed by replacement
with complete DMEM for 1h. Soluble cell lysates (SCL)
were prepared by incubating cells in ice cold Magnesium
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL-pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl,
1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% Sodium deoxycholate
(w/v),10% glycerol, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
EDTA ,10 μg aprotinin/mL, 10 μg leupeptin/mL, 1 mM
vanadate, 100 μM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) for 15
min and followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min.
In inhibitor studies, HMC-1 cells were plated in complete
DMEM and treated for 4h with either DMSO, Dasatinib
(50nM), II-B08 (50 µM) alone or in combination of
Dasatinib and II-B08 and cell lysates were prepared as
described above.

DBA/2 mice (6-8 week old) were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC, USA), and
housed at Queen’s Animal Care Services according to
protocols approved by the Queen’s University Animal
Care committee in accordance with Canadian Council
on Animal Care guidelines. P815-NT or -KD2 (5 x
103/100 µl of PBS) were injected in retro-orbital sinus
using 27 gauge needle under anesthesia (isoflurane).
Mice had become moribund by day 13-16, and were
anesthetized prior to cardiac puncture, and sacrificed
prior to collection of bone marrow, spleen and liver
tissues. Single cell suspensions were obtained from
bone marrow, blood and spleen prior to red blood cell
(RBC) lysis and staining with PE-conjugated anti-mouse
CD117, PEcy5-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 to identify
mastocytoma cells. PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b,
PEcy5-conjugated anti-mouse CD45R (B220) and FITCconjugated anti-mouse Gr1 staining were used to identify
macrophages, B cells and neutrophils, respectively. All
samples were analysed by flow cytometry, with gating set
using isotype control antibodies. Subsequent data analysis
and histogram preparation was performed using Flowjo
software. Absolute numbers of cells were calculated by
multiplication of total cells obtained from the target organ
and percentage population determined by flow cytometry
for indicated immune cell markers. Liver tissue sections
were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
and metastatic tumors were quantified from 5 randomly
selected fields of view.

Cell proliferation, colony, and apoptosis assays

Statistical analyses

P815-NT, P815-KD1 and P815-KD2 (1 x 105) cells
were plated in complete DMEM in triplicate wells, and
total cell numbers were scored at 24, 48 and 72 hours

Differences between P815-NT and P815-KD cells
were tested using paired student T-test, and significance
differences were indicated by P <0.05 (Microsoft Excel).
