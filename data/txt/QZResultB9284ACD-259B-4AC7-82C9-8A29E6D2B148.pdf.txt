BACKGROUND: Patients’ perception of their prognosis has an impact on their decisions about medical care. However, the relations
between prognostic understanding and quality of life (QoL) and mood are unknown. The objectives of this study were to assess perceptions of prognosis and preferences for prognostic information among patients with advanced cancer and to explore the associations of prognostic understanding with QoL and mood. METHODS: Fifty patients were assessed within 6 to 12 weeks of initiating
chemotherapy for advanced gastrointestinal cancers. A 13-item questionnaire was used to assess patients’ information preferences,
perceptions of their prognosis and goal of therapy, and communication about end-of-life care. The Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-General and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess QoL and mood, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty of
62 (80%) consecutive, eligible patients were enrolled. Thirty-eight of 50 patients (75%) wanted to know as many details as possible
about their cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, 25 of 50 patients (50%) stated that the goal of therapy was to “cure their cancer,” and only 10 of 49 patients (22%) reported having a discussion about end-of-life preferences with their oncologist. Patients who
acknowledged their illness as terminal reported lower QoL (P 5.005) and higher anxiety (P 5.003) compared with those who did not
perceive themselves as being terminally ill. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients desired detailed information about their illness, half
incorrectly perceived their cancer as curable. Accurate prognostic understanding was associated with lower QoL and worse anxiety.
Interventions to improve patients’ prognostic understanding while providing adequate psychosocial support are warranted. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Patients with advanced cancer are often confronted with difficult decisions regarding the receipt of additional cancer
therapies and end-of-life care once previous treatments have failed. For these patients, understanding the specific goals of
treatment and cancer prognosis plays a pivotal role in the informed decision-making process.1-3 Such illness understanding is particularly relevant for patients with advanced, incurable cancers who have a poor overall survival. For example,
individuals diagnosed with advanced upper gastrointestinal tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, have low rates of response
to chemotherapy with minimal survival benefit.4-9 In addition to the limited impact of chemotherapy on survival, treatment carries significant side effects and toxicities, which can negatively affect patients’ quality of life (QoL).5-12 Balancing
the potential benefits and possible risks of treatment in this context necessitates an informed decision-making approach.
Thus, to make sound decisions regarding care, patients with advanced cancers need an accurate understanding of their
prognosis and the goals of treatment.
Patients who are well informed regarding their cancer diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis make different
decisions about their medical care compared with those who are less informed. For example, studies demonstrate that
patients’ willingness to accept chemotherapy depends, in part, on their understanding of the likelihood of achieving a cure
with therapy.13-15 In addition, patients who overestimate their chance of survival are more likely to receive life-extending
therapies and aggressive care at the end of life,16 whereas those who acknowledge their terminal illness are more likely to
prefer symptom-directed care and to receive end-of-life care that is consistent with their wishes.17 Therefore, accurate
prognostic understanding may facilitate effective decisions about end-of-life care and reduce the likelihood of receiving
potentially futile treatments.18-21

Prognosis, QoL, and Mood in Advanced CA/El-Jawahri et al

Over the past decade, researchers have begun to
characterize perceptions of illness and prognosis among
patients with cancer.22-25 However, little is known about
the impact of prognostic understanding on patients’ QoL
and mood. Acknowledging the terminal nature of one’s
illness may place significant emotional and psychological
distress on patients. To our knowledge, no studies have
concurrently examined the relations between prognostic
understanding and patients’ psychological outcomes or
QoL. Wright and colleagues reported that discussions
about end-of-life care were not associated with higher rates
of depression or worry.26 However, although the investigators examined whether patients recalled participating in
a discussion about their end-of-life care preferences, they
did not assess patients’ perceptions of prognosis.
We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study
of patients who had incurable noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancer to explore their perceptions of prognosis and
goals of care. Moreover, we sought to investigate the relations between prognostic understanding and particular
patient factors, including perceptions of treatment goals,
information preferences, demographic characteristics,
clinical variables, and self-reported QoL and mood symptoms. By exploring associations between patients’ illness
perceptions and QoL and mood, we sought to identify
those who may require additional support in coping with
their illness and related treatment decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

The sample included ambulatory patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center who were
receiving chemotherapy for newly diagnosed, advanced,
noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancer at the time of enrollment. Patients were eligible for study participation if they
had a confirmed, new diagnosis of advanced gastroesophageal, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic cancer; were able to
read and respond to questions in English; and were not
receiving treatment with curative intent. We confirmed
the intent of therapy by reviewing the chemotherapy consent forms in the electronic medical record. On these consent forms, the primary oncologist must select the goals of
therapy from the following options: “cure,” “prolong life
without getting rid of the cancer completely,” or
“palliation.” Patients who were receiving treatment with
curative intent were not eligible for this study.
Study Design

All gastrointestinal oncologists at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center agreed to participate in this
Cancer

study. Study staff identified potential participants
through the new patient database of the Massachusetts
General Hospital Gastrointestinal Cancer Center and followed patients until their staging diagnostics were complete. A trained research assistant obtained permission
from the treating oncologist by email to approach eligible
patients during regularly scheduled oncology clinic visits
within 6 to 12 weeks after the initiation of the first chemotherapy regimen. We chose this recruitment window to
ensure that patients would have several opportunities to
discuss goals of therapy and prognosis with their oncology
providers before study participation. In addition, because
of the sensitive nature of the items on the questionnaire,
we did not want to enroll study participants immediately
after diagnosis. Willing patients provided written
informed consent and completed the self-report questionnaires during their clinic visits. Study staff subsequently
obtained clinical data from the patients’ electronic medical records. We recruited patients consecutively until we
achieved a sample size of 50 participants, and we documented reasons for refusal to participate.
Study Measures
Prognostic perceptions

We measured self-reported prognostic perceptions using
the 13-item Prognosis and Treatment Perceptions Questionnaire (PTPQ), which assesses patient beliefs regarding:
1) the likelihood of cure, 2) the importance and helpfulness
of knowing about prognosis, 3) the primary goal of cancer
care, 4) preference for information about treatment, and 5)
satisfaction with the quality of information received about
prognosis and treatment. We originally adapted the PTPQ
based on a questionnaire that was developed for parents of
children with cancer and additional validated items from
previous studies.26-30 We then performed cognitive interviews with 15 patients who had metastatic lung cancer and
conducted content analyses to refine the questionnaire and
ensure its content validity, readability, and acceptability.
Patients denied experiencing discomfort answering the survey questions. We modified 8 questions based on participants’ responses, primarily by defining medical terms that
were difficult for them to comprehend. For example, we
modified all questions that included the word prognosis by
defining it as “the expected outcome of your cancer over
time.” We eliminated 2 questions because of their repetitive
nature. We retained 5 questions without modifications,
because none of the participants reported any difficulty
with answering or comprehending those questions.
We evaluated patients’ perception of their prognosis
using 2 previously developed items. First, participants
279

Original Article

rated the likelihood that they would be cured of cancer on
a 7-point scale (ranging from “no chance=0% chance” to
“extremely likely=greater than 90% chance”).16,31 We
dichotomized responses as incurable (ie, “no chance” to
“unlikely chance”) versus likely to be cured (ie, “somewhat
likely” to “extremely likely”). Second, participants rated
their medical status with regard to current health and terminal illness using a validated 4-item scale that has been
used extensively in prior studies.26,28-30 We dichotomized
the responses as either “terminally ill” or “not terminally
ill.”
Information preferences and treatment goals

We used additional items from the PTPQ to evaluate
patients’ information preferences and treatment goals.
Specifically, participants reported their preference for
receiving information about diagnosis and treatment
(“prefer not to hear a lot of details,” “want to hear details
only in certain situations,” or “want to hear as many
details as possible”). We also asked participants to choose
their primary goal of cancer treatment among the following options: “to lessen suffering,” “to be able to keep
hoping,” “to make sure I have done everything,” “to
extend my life as long as possible,” “to cure my cancer,”
“to help cancer research,” and “other.” Participants rated
the importance of knowing about their prognosis on a 5point scale (ranging from “extremely important,” to “not
at all important”). In addition, we asked participants to
rate how they felt about the amount of information they
had received regarding their prognosis on a 3-point scale
(“wishing for more information,” “having the right
amount of information,” or “wishing for less
information”). Finally, we asked participants whether
they had had a discussion with their oncologists regarding
end-of-life care, and the responses were dichotomized as
“yes” or “no.”
Sociodemographic and clinical factors

Each participant completed a demographic questionnaire
that included age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status,
income, and education level. We reviewed participants’
electronic medical records to obtain data on cancer diagnosis, stage of disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status, and the number of oncology
visits.
Psychological distress

We measured anxiety and depression symptoms with the
14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
The HADS consists of 2 subscales for anxiety and
280

depression symptoms in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (no distress) to 21 (maximum distress). The
HADS has demonstrated strong psychometric properties
in samples of adults with cancer.32 Higher total and
subscale scores indicate higher levels of distress.
Quality of life

We used the well validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire to assess
QoL.33 The FACT-G contains 28 items that comprise 4
subscales assessing physical, functional, emotional, and
social well being during the past week. Higher total and
subscale scores indicate better QoL.
Statistical Analysis

To evaluate the feasibility of recruiting patients and collecting data on prognostic understanding, we identified
the number of consecutive patients needed to enroll a
sample of 50 participants and the reasons for refusing to
participate. To identify the level of accuracy in prognostic
understanding among participants, we reported responses
(frequencies) to the PTPQ items, including perceptions
of the likelihood of cure (incurable vs likely to be cured)
and terminal illness status (terminally ill vs not terminally
ill). Finally, we explored associations between the 2 prognostic understanding variables (likelihood of cure and terminal illness status) and patient demographic=clinical
factors by conducting chi-square and Fisher exact tests for
categorical variables as well as t tests and analyses of variance for continuous variables, with a 2-sided P < .05. To
conduct all statistical tests, we used IBM SPSS Statistics,
version 19.

Prognostic Understanding

Among the participants, 54% (27 of 50 patients) perceived that their cancer was likely to be cured (Fig. 1), and
less than half (46%; 23 of 50 patients) perceived themselves to be terminally ill. Those participants who
acknowledged their terminal illness also were more likely
to state that their cancer was incurable (Fisher exact test;
P < .001), demonstrating consistency in their
understanding.
Associations of Prognostic Understanding With
Treatment Goals and Information Preferences

The majority of participants endorsed that it was
“extremely” (64%; 32 of 50 patients) or “very” (20%; 10
of 50 patients) important to know about their prognosis
(Fig. 1). Most participants (75%; 38 of 50 patients) also
endorsed that they wanted to hear as many details as possible related to their cancer and its treatment (Fig. 2). In
addition, approximately two-thirds (68%; 24 of 50
patients) felt that they currently had the right amount of
information about their prognosis, whereas one-third
(32%; 16 of 50 patients) wanted to know more. With
regard to treatment goals, approximately half (52%; 26 of
50 patients) endorsed that their primary treatment goal
was to cure their cancer (Fig. 2). Most participants (78%;
39 of 50 patients) reported that they had not discussed
end-of-life care with their oncologists.
Participants were more likely to choose curing their
cancer as their primary treatment goal if they reported
that their cancer was likely curable (vs incurable: Fisher
exact test; P < .001). Compared with those who believed

their cancer was likely to be cured did not differ in their
preference for treatment and prognostic information,
desire for knowledge about treatment and prognosis, frequency of discussion with their oncologists about prognosis, or their report of having an end-of-life discussion with
their oncologist.

inaccurately perceived that they were being treated with
curative intent and believed that their cancer was likely to
be cured. By comparison, patients with an accurate prognostic understanding were more likely to have realistic
treatment goals. In addition, we observed that accurate
prognostic understanding and acknowledgment of terminal illness were associated with worse QoL and anxiety
symptoms.
Although the medical community has placed a
strong emphasis on the importance of frank discussions
and accurate prognostic disclosure for patients and their
families, our findings raise questions regarding how best
to support patients who acknowledge their illness as terminal. We observed that patients who had an accurate
prognostic understanding and those who acknowledged
their terminal illness had significantly worse QoL and
anxiety symptoms. This finding suggests that, as patients
gain a more accurate understanding of the nature and the
likely outcome of their illness, they require more psychosocial support to help them cope with their diagnosis.
These results should not be used to justify avoiding prognostic disclosure given patients’ strong preference for information. In fact, considering the degree of prognostic
misperception, more discussions are warranted to convey
prognostic information more accurately while providing
adequate support for patients.
Unfortunately, only 22% of patients in our study
reported discussing their end-of-life wishes with their
oncologists. Physicians’ inability to engage patients and
families in these essential conversations may contribute to
the anxiety, uncertainty, and isolation that some patients
Cancer

experience. Furthermore, even patients who responded
that they had an end-of-life discussion with their oncologist did not report a more accurate understanding of their
prognosis. Although this may be because of the lack of statistical power given the small number of patients, it also
may reflect the quality of conversations about end-of-life
care. More research is necessary to determine how best to
convey prognostic information to patients in an emotionally sensitive manner while providing adequate psychological support.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
that patients’ accurate illness perception is associated with
higher anxiety and worse QoL. This is an important finding, because previous studies suggested that end-of-life
discussions were not associated with worse psychological
distress.26 In our study, however, we focused on the associations between psychological distress and both illness
perception and prognostic understanding as opposed to
end-of-life care discussions. Patients may experience various degrees of emotional distress, depending on the context of end-of-life care discussions and the amount of
information that they retain. Moreover, although oncologists may raise the topic of end-of-life care, such discussions may not translate into more accurate prognostic
understanding in patients. One could imagine that grappling with the terminal nature of an illness would be the
most distressing aspect of prognostic understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for a comprehensive approach
to assist patients in clarifying their illness understanding
while coping with the psychosocial ramifications of their
terminal prognosis.
By engaging patients in honest and empathic endof-life discussions to address their fears, clinicians may
help patients cope better with their incurable illness. It is
possible that the quality of communication between
patients and their physicians may play a role in patients’
psychological response and their ability to cope with such
information. Outlining realistic goals that patients and
families can look forward to may provide an avenue for
maintaining hope in light of a life-threatening illness.
Thus, as physicians engage patients in end-of-life discussions, screening and identifying those at risk for psychological distress and referring them for appropriate services
is essential to ensure they are receiving adequate care and
support.
Several of our findings are consistent with and build
upon the results of previous research. First, we observed
that patients preferred detailed information about their
cancer diagnosis, treatment goals, and prognosis. A prior
study of patients with metastatic cancer demonstrated
283

Original Article

that 85% of patients wanted to know more details about
their prognosis.24 Despite these data confirming that
patients prefer to receive detailed information about their
illness and prognosis, recent data also demonstrate that
patients continue to have serious misconceptions about
the goals of treatment. In a recent study, 69% of patients
with metastatic lung cancer and 81% of patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer did not understand that
chemotherapy was unlikely to cure their disease.22 Our
study also demonstrated that over half of patients with incurable noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancers believed
that the primary treatment goal was to cure their illness.
Such unrealistic treatment goals are not surprising given
that the majority also perceived that their cancers likely
were curable.
Our study has several important limitations. One of
the main limitations is the small, relatively homogenous
sample of patients with noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancers included in this study. Therefore, the findings may
not generalize to patients with lower education, minority
groups, or patients from different geographic areas. The
small sample size also may have affected our ability to
detect actual differences in prognostic understanding by
demographic and clinical factors because of limited statistical power. Second, we did not examine patients’ use of
psychiatric, palliative care, and social work services, which
may improve patients’ coping and mood.34 However, it is
unlikely that study participants used these services extensively this early in the course of their illness. Third,
although our findings suggest an association between
prognostic understanding and QoL and mood, the data
do not allow us to determine the direction of this association. It is also plausible that patients with lower QoL and
more anxiety have a more realistic perception of their illness and prognosis. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of
this study does not allow us to examine the temporal relation between goals of care discussions and patients’ QoL
and mood symptoms. Finally, survey methods may
underestimate the numbers of patients who actually
understood the nature of their illness and treatment goals.
In summary, we demonstrated that patients with
advanced noncolorectal gastrointestinal malignancies
hold significant misconceptions about the goal of their
cancer treatment and prognosis despite their strong wishes
for detailed information relating to their cancer. Patients
with accurate perceptions of their prognosis had more realistic treatment goals. It is noteworthy that accurate prognostic understanding was associated with lower QoL and
higher anxiety symptoms, which highlights an important
need for more psychosocial support of patients as they
284

come to terms with their terminal illness. Future research
should focus on determining the optimal timing and
method to deliver prognostic information along with
adequate assessment of patients’ emotional and psychological needs to facilitate effective coping strategies after
the delivery of such information.
