ABSTRACT
The oncogenic bHLH-LZ transcription factor Myc forms binary complexes with
its binding partner Max. These and other bHLH-LZ-based protein-protein interactions
(PPI) in the Myc-Max network are essential for the physiological and oncogenic
activities of Myc. We have generated a genetically determined and highly specific
protein-fragment complementation assay based on Renilla luciferase to analyze the
dynamic interplay of bHLH-LZ transcription factors Myc, Max, and Mxd1 in vivo. We
also applied this PPI reporter to quantify alterations of nuclear Myc-Max complexes in
response to mutational events, competitive binding by the transcriptional repressor
Mxd1, or perturbations by small-molecule Myc inhibitors, including recently identified
potent PPI inhibitors from a Kröhnke pyridine library. We show that the specificity
of Myc-Max PPI reduction by the pyridine inhibitors directly correlates with their
efficient and highly specific potential to interfere with the proliferation of human and
avian tumor cells displaying deregulated Myc expression. In a direct comparison with
known Myc inhibitors using human and avian cell systems, the pyridine compounds
reveal a unique inhibitory potential even at sub-micromolar concentrations combined
with remarkable specificity for the inhibition of Myc-driven tumor cell proliferation.
Furthermore, we show in direct comparisons using defined avian cell systems that
different Max PPI profiles for the variant members of the Myc protein family (c‑Myc,
v-Myc, N-Myc, L-Myc) correlate with their diverse oncogenic potential and their
variable sensitivity to the novel pyridine inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

elements (E-boxes, preferentially CACGTG), and is the
central node of a universal transcription factor network [58]. In human cells, Myc transcription factor circuits control
thousands of genes involved in essential cellular processes
like growth, proliferation, differentiation, biosynthesis,
energy metabolism, and apoptosis [7, 8]. Recent studies
suggest that Myc, rather than acting as a conventional
transcription factor with a specific set of target genes,
can function as a general amplifier of transcription [9,
10]. The principal biochemical activity of the Myc-Max
complex is transcriptional activation, but Myc can also act
as a transcriptional repressor of specific target genes [7,

The myc oncogene was originally discovered as
the transforming principle (v-myc) in the genome of
avian acute leukemia virus MC29 [1]. The v-myc allele
is derived from the chicken cellular protooncogene c-myc
by retroviral transduction [2, 3]. The Myc protein product,
initially identified as a viral Gag-Myc hybrid protein
encoded by MC29 genomic RNA [4], is a transcriptional
regulator of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper
(bHLH-LZ) protein family, forms heterodimers with the
bHLH-LZ protein Max, binds to specific DNA sequence

8, 11]. The discovery of chromosomal rearrangements of
the human MYC gene in Burkitt’s lymphoma was the first
link of the cellular homolog of a retroviral oncogene to
human cancer [12]. Today deregulated MYC expression is
recognized as a crucial driving force in many, if not most
human cancers [2, 7, 8]. Mutations in the coding region
of MYC are not required for oncogenicity and do not play
important roles in human cancer, but can enhance the
oncogenic potential like in v-myc [2].
Because of its pivotal role in cancer, Myc has
become an obvious target for attempting to identify small
molecule inhibitors with therapeutic potential. However,
Myc is not structured like an enzyme with a well defined
catalytic cleft; it is even intrinsically disordered in free
form [13], and all its biochemical and biological activities
are based on macromolecular interactions, in particular
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving large
flat surface areas that are difficult to target with small
molecules [14]. Nevertheless, experimental inhibition
of Myc functions in cultured cells has been achieved by
small molecules interfering with Myc-Max dimerization
[15-17]. Recently, efficient and specific inhibitors of
Myc-Max dimerization were identified that are also
capable to halt Myc-driven tumor growth in vivo [18].

We have described a genetically determined and highly
specific protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA)
based on the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and have applied
it to a quantitative analysis of Myc-Max interaction
in living cells [18]. Here, we use this reporter assay to
more broadly characterize PPIs of the Myc-Max network.
We also compare the effects of different Myc inhibitors
on Myc-Max dimerization and on human and avian
Myc-driven cell transformation and proliferation. We
document the different oncogenic potentials of the c‑Myc,
v-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc proteins and correlate these
activities with the ability to interact with Max and with the
sensitivity to specific inhibitors.

on the Rluc [19, 20] to quantify and dissect complex
formation of bHLH-LZ transcription factor dimers
directly in the living cell [18]. The general principle of
the Rluc-PCA is based on PPI-dependent folding and
complementation of the luciferase reporter when two
proteins fused to Rluc fragment 1 (F[1]) and to fragment
2 (F[2]) interact (Fig. 1A). The highly specific Rluc-PCA
for Myc-Max PPI detection [18] was used to quantify
the effect of various factors on Myc-Max complex
formation, the most important PPI for Myc-driven cancer
cell proliferation. We fused complementary fragments
of the previously described Rluc-PCA to the carboxyl
(C) terminus (amino acids 332-439) of human c-Myc
or to full-length human Myc and to full-length chicken
Max (Fig. 1B). Human and chicken Max show 100%
amino acid identity in the bHLH-LZ region (Fig. S1A).

A 10-aa encoding linker was inserted between the PCA
fragments and the transcription factor [20]. Combinations
of the indicated Rluc-PCA constructs including the control
protein kinase A (PKA) reporter [20, 21] were transiently
overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Using the Rluc-PCA
signal generated by the addition of the luciferase substrate
benzyl-coelenterazine as a read out, we observed complex
formation of homo- and heterodimers of the control PKA
reporter, as expected (Fig. 1C). We also observed strong
signals indicating heterodimeric complexes of the RlucPCA-tagged transcription factor pairs Myc-Max and
Myc(332-439)-Max. Myc does not form homodimers
under physiological conditions [8, 13, 22], and we did not
observe signals from PCA pairs containing Myc fragments
only. However, we detected strong signals indicating MaxMax homodimer formation (Fig.1C) in agreement with

and the dimerization-defective mutant v-Myc* (L397P). Quail embryo fibroblasts (QEF) were transfected with 6-µg aliquots of the
plasmids pRc-v-myc, pRc-v-myc*, or with the empty pRc vector. Cells were kept under agar overlay for two weeks and then stained with
eosin methylene blue. Foci were counted on 60-mm dishes (a section is shown; representative experiment of n=2, ± SD of triplicates). (B)

chemically transformed QT6 cells transiently expressing Max-F[1]:v-Myc-F[2] (wt) or Max-F[1]:v-Myc*-F[2] (L397P) PCA pairs. RlucPCA tagged hybrid proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis.

of Mxd1 was analyzed by immunoblotting.

published data [23]. Notably, PCA reporter constructs for
Myc and Max were only functional when the fragments
were in parallel orientation (Fig. 1B) as required for
bHLH-LZ interactions [22, 23]. As a control, we did not
detect significant luminescence signals of mixed pairs
of PKA and Myc/Max PCA reporters (Fig. 1C). Protein
expression of all PCA reporter constructs used was
monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. S1B). Transcription
factor complexes of the Myc-Max network perform their
key functions as homo- and heterodimers in the nucleus
[6, 8]. Localization of Rluc-PCA complexes using Rluc
signals as a read-out is technically challenging and
provides images with less resolution than a fluorescencebased reporter. To confirm that PCA-tagged Myc-Max
complexes are correctly localized in cells, we replaced
Rluc-PCA fragments with Venus-YFP PCA fragments
[24, 25] to obtain Venus-YFP-based PCA reporters for
Myc-Max complexes (Fig. S2A,B). In agreement with
previous visualization studies on truncated Myc fragments
[26], we observed nuclear complexes of full-length MycMax, C-terminal Myc(332-439)-Max, and Max-Max
(Fig. S2C). As a control, the Venus-YFP PCA reporter for
PKA regulatory type II subunit (RII) homodimers showed
cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. S2C).
Mutations of the LZ-motif can reduce Myc-Max
dimerization and Myc function in vitro and in vivo [5,
27]. We confirmed that the L397P mutation of v-Myc
(corresponding to L420P in human c-Myc) completely
abolished its oncogenic potential as assayed by focus
formation of transfected primary quail embryo fibroblasts
(QEF) (Fig. 2A). Equal expression levels of wild type
v-Myc and mutated v-Myc(L397P) in transfected QEF
were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). Comparing
Rluc-PCA Myc-Max reporter constructs based on
wild type v-Myc with mutant v-Myc, we observed an
approximately 80% reduction of dimerization for the
mutant despite significantly elevated expression levels
(Fig. 2C). Myc-Max complex formation and Myc function
are also affected by competing bHLH-LZ transcription
factor interactions. We demonstrated this effect with the
Mxd1 (or Mad1) protein which dimerizes with Max [6, 8,
28]. We generated SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells
stably transfected with the Myc(332-439)-Max Rluc-PCA.
Transient overexpression of Mxd1 in these cells competed
for Max binding and caused a dose-dependent reduction of
PCA signals (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of Mxd1 had no
effect on the control Rluc-PCA measuring PKA RII subunit
dimerization (Fig. S3A). Posttranslational modifications
also modulate Myc function. Phosphorylation sites of
Myc affect both stability and PPIs [29, 30]. Residues
S373 and T400 in the human c-Myc HLH region can
be phosphorylated by p21-activated kinase, leading to
disturbance of Myc-Max interaction [29]. We substituted
glutamic acid for these residues to mimic phosphorylation,
and used these mutants for PCA analysis. The double
mutation of T400E and S373E in c-Myc led to a reduction
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Myc-Max complex formation by approximately 40%
compared to the wild type control (Fig. S3B). Collectively,
our data on the LZ mutation, Mxd1 competition, and
phosphorylation site mutations demonstrate the specificity,
sensitivity, and reliability of the Rluc-PCA as a tool to
monitor PPI in the Myc-Max network.

Effect of Myc inhibitors on Myc-Max complex
formation and human cancer cell proliferation
Disruption of the Myc-Max PPI leads to a reduction
of DNA binding, of transcriptional activity and of
oncogenic potential [15-18]. Here we used the PCA
reporters to compare the effects of the established Myc
inhibitors 10074-G5 and 10058-F4 [16, 17] with the

recently published KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10 compounds
[18]. The structures of all inhibitors are shown in Fig. S4.
KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10 reduced complex formation of
Myc(332-439):Max by approximately 35-40% (Fig. 3A)
in agreement with published results [18]. Both compounds
had little or no effect on homodimerization of the RII
subunits of PKA used as control. We also compared the
effect of KJ-Pyr-10, 10074-G5, and 10058-F4 on complex
formation of full-length Myc with Max using the RlucPCA Myc-Max biosensor. Since 10074-G5 showed a
nonspecific reduction of the PKA control signal, we
standardized the reduction rates for the Myc-Max complex
formation relative to this control and obtained inhibition
of 24% for KJ-Pyr-10, 26% for 10074-G5, and 11% for
10058-F4 (Fig. 3A). In order to compare the properties of
these inhibitors in the Rluc-PCA with their efficacy and
specificity in inhibition of Myc-driven cell proliferation,
we tested the dose- and time-dependent effects of KJPyr-10, 10074-G5, and 10058-F4 on the proliferation
of the human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4
which displays high Myc expression levels [31]. KJPyr-10 showed the strongest dose-dependent inhibition
of MOLT-4 cell proliferation (Fig. 3B) and a one-time
application of KJ-Pyr-10 for 72 h at 1 µM was sufficient
to inhibit proliferation of MOLT-4 cells. Concentrations
of KJ-Pyr-10 beyond 10 µM led to increased cell death

(Fig. 3B).

Specificity of Myc inhibitors
We used avian cells to compare KJ-Pyr-9 and KJPyr-10 with 10074-G5 and 10058-F4 in greater detail.
Three cell types were selected for this study: normal QEF,
Myc-driven QEF (transformed by the MC29 retrovirus),
and QT6, a continuous quail cell line derived from a
methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma [32]. The KJPyr-9 inhibitor specifically inhibited the proliferation
of the Myc-driven, MC29-transformed QEF, but it had
virtually no effect on the chemically transformed QT6,
even at the highest dose tested (Fig. 4A). Notably, Northern
blot analysis confirmed that QT6 cells show normal c-myc
expression, and QEF/MC29 display high v-myc expression
in form of MC29 genomic RNA (Fig. 4B). In a similar
comparison, we used again normal QEF and QT6, but for
the Myc-driven QEF, we replaced MC29 with the RCASv-Myc vector that expresses v-Myc without the viral gag
sequences. KJ-Pyr-9, KJ-Pyr-10 specifically inhibited the
proliferation of Myc-driven cells by 50% at 1 µM, but
did not affect normal QEF and QT6 (Fig. 4C). 10074G5 and 10058-F4 reached similar levels of inhibition at
higher concentrations (10 µM and 30 µM respectively),
but at those concentrations also affected the replication

MC29 or the methylcholanthrene-transformed quail cell line QT6 were treated for 24 h with inhibitor compound KJ-Pyr-9 at the indicated

We also compared the effects of KJ-Pyr-10, 10074-G5,
and 10058-F4 on the proliferation of the tet-off quail cell
line Q/tM8 conditionally transformed by a doxycycline
controlled v-myc oncogene [33]. KJ-Pyr-10 and 10074G5 showed the strongest inhibitory effect, particularly
when the cells were subjected to a dox-/dox+/dox- cycle
to induce reversion and re-initiation of the transformed
phenotype (Fig. S5). Again, the pyridine inhibitor showed
the strongest effect at lower concentrations. In summary,
the comparative analyses confirmed the potency and
specificity of the pyridine inhibitors KJ-Pyr-9 and KJPyr-10.

strongest inhibition, followed by N-Myc-transformed
cells. In contrast, the proliferation of L-Myc-transformed

Comparative analysis of oncogenicity, PPI, and
inhibition of Myc family members
In addition to c-Myc, the human Myc transcription
factor family includes the paralogs N-Myc and L-Myc
with different oncogenic potential and tumor specificity [2,
8, 34]. We have cloned the coding regions of the chicken
orthologs of N-Myc and L-Myc genes (Fig. S6) into the
retroviral RCAS vector to directly compare the oncogenic
potential of c-Myc, v-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc in QEF.
In an assay for anchorage-independent growth, v-Myc
showed the highest potential to induce colony formation
in nutrient agar, followed by N-Myc and c-Myc (Fig. 5A).
Expression of L-Myc induced only low numbers of small
colonies. We also analyzed the effect of the four Myc
variants on the expression of two previously characterized
transcriptional targets of v-Myc, the activated WS5 gene
[35] and the suppressed BASP1 gene [36]. Strikingly, the
extent of expression modulation of these transcriptional
targets correlated exactly with the oncogenic potential
as determined in the colony assay (Fig. 5A). We also
quantified the potential of the four Myc variants to
dimerize with Max by using the Rluc-PCA. Following
transient transfections of equal amounts of expression
vectors into QT6 cells and normalization on Myc protein
expression levels, we observed strong interactions of
N-Myc, v-Myc, and c-Myc (in decreasing order) with
Max, but substantially lower PPI signals for the L-MycMax interaction (Fig. 5B). This quantification of PPIs with
Max correlates with the oncogenic potential of the four
proteins in the avian cell system.
In order to comparatively analyze the effect of
pyridine-based inhibitors on the four Myc variants, we
established QEF cell lines transformed by the RCAS
constructs specifying c-Myc, v-Myc, N-Myc, and
L-Myc. After 25 passages, all transformed cells showed
enhanced doubling times [v-Myc (21 h ±1), N-Myc (22
h ±1), c-Myc (23 h ±1), L-Myc (27 h ±1)] in comparison
to normal QEF (49 h ±4). The effect of inhibitor KJPyr-10 on the proliferation of these cells was analyzed
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). The proliferation

cells seeded are shown below the bright-field micrographs
(representative of n=3 independent experiments; ± SD from

was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies (left

expression of target genes suppressed (BASP1) or activated
(WS5) by v-Myc [35, 36] was monitored by Northern blotting
using gene-specific probes (right panels). Hybridization with
a GAPDH probe was used as loading control. (B) PPI of Myc
variants with Max was determined in Rluc-PCA experiments of

cells was only moderately inhibited, even at the highest
inhibitor dose. Strikingly, the proliferation of cells driven
by the most strongly oncogenic Myc variant, v-Myc,
was substantially inhibited by KJ-Pyr-10 at nanomolar
concentrations (Fig. 5C).

only after binding to Max [13, 22]. The recently identified
inhibitors, KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10, were shown to be
highly effective and specific both for the inhibition of the
Myc-Max complex formation and of Myc oncogenicity as
well as for Myc-mediated transcription. KJ-Pyr-9 was also
tested in vivo and shown to halt the growth of a xenograft
of human breast cancer cells [18]. We have now extended
the characterization of KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10 and
compared them with 10058-F4 and 10074-G5. The results
(Figs. 3, 4 and S5) confirm and extend the efficacy and
specificity of KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10 in inhibiting MycMax dimerization and the growth of Myc-driven human
and avian cells. The pyridine inhibitors are effective at
nanomolar concentrations against v-myc-transformed
quail cells, but show no effect on normal or chemically
transformed QT6 cells. Yet QT6 cells are as vigorously
proliferating as QEF/MC29; the critical difference being
the level of Myc expression which is much higher in the
latter (Fig. 4). These data document the specificity of the
pyridine inhibitors for Myc-driven cells.
The avian cell system has the advantage to allow
for quantification of transforming events induced by
single oncogenes in cultured primary cells. We used this
approach to directly compare all members of the chicken
Myc family (c-Myc, N-Myc, L-Myc, and c-Myc-derived
v-Myc) with respect to their oncogenic potential, target
gene regulation, affinity for dimerization with Max, and
their sensitivity to KJ-Pyr-10. The oncogenic potential
of the four proteins directly correlates with their effect
on the expression of v-Myc target genes and with the
dimerization signal detected by PCA. Our results on
the relative oncogenic potency of Myc proteins are
also in agreement with comparable studies measuring
transformation of murine fibroblasts cotransfected with
ras [34]. In view of the broad significance of c-Myc in the
etiology of human cancers and the impact of N-Myc and
L-Myc in specific tumors like neuroblastoma and small
cell lung cancer, the effectiveness of the pyridine inhibitors
justifies further efforts to improve the pharmacokinetic
and solubility properties. Binding sites for KJ-Pyr-9
and KJ-Pyr-10 need to be identified, and the molecular
mechanisms of Myc inhibition need to be determined.

DISCUSSION
Deregulation of Myc expression is a striking
hallmark of many human tumors [2, 7, 8, 34, 37]. In
view of the remarkable success in the development of
small-molecule inhibitors for the therapy of cancers
that are driven by oncogenes encoding kinases [38, 39],
Myc also became a compelling target for possible drug
development. However, Myc has no enzymatic function,
and the obvious target for inhibition with small molecules the interaction with Max - is difficult to disrupt effectively.
PPIs are challenging targets for small-molecule inhibitors
[14, 40], although there are examples of PPI inhibitors in
the clinic [41-43]. In spite of these principal difficulties,
experimental inhibition of Myc-Max dimerization with
small molecules has made steady progress [15-18]. In the
present study, we have used a novel PCA tool to quantify
PPIs in the Myc-Max network, and have also compared
several inhibitors of Myc-Max dimerization. The results
demonstrate that the Myc-Max Rluc-PCA is a specific and
sensitive reporter to monitor PPI in the Myc-Max network.
It reliably registers perturbations of Myc-Max interactions
caused by single amino acid substitutions known to
negatively regulate Myc function. It also dynamically
registers perturbation of the Myc-Max PPI by competing
bHLH-LZ proteins like Mxd1, or the inhibition of MycMax complex formation by small-molecule inhibitors.
Notably, the PPI signals of the Myc-Max Rluc-PCA
are generated in living cells, and the signals from an
analogous fluorescent reporter indicate the correct cellular
compartimentalization of Myc-Max PPI. Based on these
properties, the Myc-Max PCA could be a useful screening
tool, also for monitoring chemical optimization of isolated
small-molecule inhibitors.
Although there is some evidence for Maxindependent activities of Myc, the principal biochemical,
biological, and oncogenic functions of Myc family
proteins are dependent on the dimerization with Max [6,
8, 11]. Hence, the preferred strategy for the development
of possible Myc inhibitors has been the search for small
molecules that can interfere with Myc-Max PPI [15-17,
44]. Some of the original isolates were useful tools for
experimental inhibition of Myc-Max interaction and Mycinduced transformation of cultured cells, but were not
successfully applied in vivo due to the lack of adequate
pharmacokinetic properties. For two of these compounds,
10058-F4 and 10074-G5, specific binding sites on Myc
and inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed [17, 44].
Both molecules stabilize the Myc monomer which is
intrinsically disordered and assumes its defined structure

adding 350 µg/ml of each antibiotic to the cell culture
medium. Normal quail embryo fibroblasts (QEF) were
prepared from 9-day-old embryos of Coturnix japonica
as described [4, 35]. The quail cell line QT6 transformed
by the chemical carcinogen methylcholanthrene and the
cell line Q/tM8 conditionally transformed by v-myc have
been described before [32, 33]. DNA transfection of quail
cells was carried out using the calcium-phosphate method.
Focus and colony assays were done as described [36].
QEF were transfected with retroviral expression vectors
coding for c-Myc, v-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc for the
generation of the Myc-transformed cell lines QEF/RCASc-Myc, QEF/RCAS-v-Myc, QEF/RCAS-N-Myc, and
QEF/RCAS-L-Myc.

T400E)-F[2].

Renilla luciferase PCA
Human HEK293 and SW480 cells, or avian QT6
cells were used for the transfections. The indicated
combinations of Rluc-PCA-based hybrid proteins were
transiently overexpressed in a 24-well plate format.
After 6-, 24-, or 48-h treatment and/or transfection, the
growth medium was removed and the cells resuspended
in PBS. Stable SW480 cell lines expressing the indicated
Rluc-PCA pairs were grown in 12-well plates for 24 or
48 h. For Rluc-PCA signal measurements, suspensions of
transfected cells were transferred to 96-well white-walled
plates and subjected to bioluminescence analysis using the
LMaxTMII384 luminometer (Molecular Devices). Rluc
bioluminescence signals were integrated for 10 s following
addition of the Rluc substrate benzyl-coelenterazine (5
µM; Nanolight).

DNA constructs
The RLuc-PCA PKA reporter consisting of PKA
subunits (RII, PKAc) fused to Rluc fragment 1 (RII-F[1])
and Rluc fragment 2 (PKAc-F[2], RII-F[2]) has been
described previously [20]. PKAc and RII were replaced
with the coding regions of Myc and Max leading to the
pcDNA3.1 (backbone vector) Rluc-PCA expression
constructs Myc-F[1]/F[2], Myc(332-439)-F[1]/F[2]
and Max-F[1]/F[2] [18]. In detail, PCR-amplified
C-terminal (aa 332 to 439) or full length (aa 1 to 439)
coding regions of human cellular Myc (specified as Myc
or c-Myc; template: c-Myc cDNA from HL-60 cells)
and full length chicken Max (aa 1 to 160; template: Max
cDNA from CEF) [13] were cloned into the 5’ end of
the humanized Rluc fragments F[1] (aa 1-110) and F[2]
(aa 111-310) upstream of the 10-aa linker (GGGGS)2.
The Venus YFP-based PCA reporter has been described
previously [20, 25]. To generate Myc and Max VenusYFP PCA expression vectors, the coding regions of
RLuc F[1] and F[2] in Myc-F[1], Myc(332-439)-F[1],
Max-F[1] and Max-F[2] were replaced by the Venus-YFP
PCA fragments (VenF[1], aa 1-158; VenF[2], aa 159239). Coding sequences of chicken c-, N-, and L-Myc
(template: CEF cDNA) and v-Myc (template: pRc-Myc)
[36] were amplified by PCR and inserted into RLuc-PCA
vectors using the same cloning strategy. For competition
experiments and transformation assays, coding regions of
human Mxd1 (template: Mxd1 cDNA from SW480 cells)
and chicken c-, v-, N- and L-Myc were subcloned into the
indicated transient (pcDNA3.1) or retroviral (pRCAS(A)
BP) expression vectors, with or without N‑terminal
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags. Using site-directed
mutagenesis, proline was substituted for leucine 397 in
pcDNA3.1/v-Myc-F[2] and pRc/HA-v-Myc to generate
v‑Myc(L397P)-F[2] and HA-v-Myc(L397P). Furthermore,
S373E and T400E substitutions in c‑Myc-F[2] generated
single mutants and the double mutant c-Myc(S373E,

Venus-YFP PCA
QEF grown on transparent slides (µ-slide 4 well,
IBIDI, # 80426) were cotransfected with Venus-YFP
PCA expression vectors (pcDNA3.1) coding for PKA RII
subunits, or for Myc (full length or truncated) and Max
proteins fused to the indicated fragments of the VenusYFP PCA (VenF[1] or VenF[2]) using the TransFectin
reagent. 48 h after transfection, cells were subjected to
fluorescence imaging. Fluorescent images were visualized
using an Axiovert 200M microscope and Axiovision 4.6
software (Carl Zeiss).

Antibodies
Monoclonal mouse anti-Rluc-F[1] (Millipore
MAB4410),
mouse
anti-Rluc-F[2]
(Millipore
MAB4400), mouse anti HA-tag (Covance), and mouse
anti α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used.

Treatment of human and avian cell lines with Myc
inhibitors
The indicated human cell lines were treated with the
pyridine-based Myc inhibitors KJ-Pyr-9 and KJ-Pyr-10
[18] or with the commercially available Myc inhibitors
10074-G5 (Calbiochem) and 10058-F4 (Calbiochem) [16,
17, 44]. All inhibitor compounds were dissolved in DMSO
(10- or 20-mM stock solutions) and diluted in culture
medium to yield the indicated final concentrations. The
Myc inhibitors were applied to cells for 6, 24, 48, 72, or
240 h. Applied inhibitor compounds were not replenished
over the 6-, 24-, 48- or 72-h time periods. For treatment
of avian Q/tM8, QT6, and QEF/MC29 cells with Myc

inhibitors, cells were seeded into 12-well dishes (3.75
x 105 cells per well) and incubated overnight at 37°C.
The culture medium was replaced by 0.5 ml of medium
without serum containing KJ-Pyr-9, KJ-Pyr-10, 10074G5, or 10058-F4 at the indicated final concentrations,
and cells were incubated at 37°C. After 2 h, 0.5 ml of
medium containing 2x serum and the final concentration
of the inhibitor compounds was added. At the indicated
time points, cells were counted and microphotographs
were taken. To test the effect of Myc inhibitors on retransformation of conditionally transformed Q/tM8
cells, cells were seeded as above and first cultivated in
the presence of doxycycline (1 µg/ml) for 4 d leading
to inhibition of v-Myc expression and reversion of the
transformed phenotype. Then, the culture medium was
replaced by medium lacking doxycycline (leading to reexpression of v-Myc), but containing the indicated Myc
inhibitors. Cells were cultivated for 10 d with medium
containing the Myc inhibitor exchanged every 80 h,
and analyzed as above. QEF/RCAS-c-Myc, -v-Myc,
-N-Myc, and -L-Myc cell lines were seeded in 6-well
plates at a density of 3.5 x 105 cells per well. 6 or 24 h
post-seeding, Myc inhibitors were applied at the indicated
concentrations. Northern analysis for monitoring c-myc
and v-myc expression, or Myc target gene expression, was
done as described [36].
