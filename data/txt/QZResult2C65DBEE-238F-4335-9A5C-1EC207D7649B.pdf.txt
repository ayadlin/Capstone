Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common age-related disease in
men. Here we tested the efficacy of Rapatar, a micellar nanoformulation of rapamycin,
in two rat models of BPH: testosterone-induced and sulpiride-induced hyperplasia in
ventral lobes and lateral/dorsal lobes, respectively. We found that Rapatar prevented
hypertrophic and hyperplastic abnormalities and degenerative alterations in both BPH
models. Rapatar normalized weight of the lateral lobes in sulpiride-induced BPH, the
most relevant animal model of human BPH. Unlike Finasteride, a standard therapy of
BPH, Rapatar reduced inflammation caused by sulpiride. No obvious side effects of
Rapatar were detected. Our data provide a rationale for clinical trials of Rapatar in
patients suffering from BPH.

INTRODUCTION

cells, which represent more than 60% of the enlarged
gland, thereby reducing prostate tone and bladder outlet
obstruction [2-4] However, these medications improve
lower urinary tract symptoms by less than 35-50% and
cause side effects.
BPH, which affects elderly men, is a clear cut
age-related disease [5, 6]. mTOR is involved in cellular
senescence [7]. Rapamycin inhibits cellular senescence
[7] and slows down organismal aging. Rapamycin also
prevents cancer in rodents and humans [8-10]. Rapamycin
decreases cellular hypertrophy [7]. These activities of
rapamycin may be useful for treatment of BPH. Recently,
Rapatar, water-soluble nanoformulated micelles of
rapamycin, was shown to delay cancer in cancer-prone
mice [11].
There are two widely used methods of BPH
induction. Testosterone and prolactin stimulate

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most
frequent disease in men. This pathology affects 50% of
men over the age 50 and 90% of men over the age 80.
BPH is associated with increased incidence of prostate
cancer [1].
Current treatments for BPH are based on three
main strategies: inhibition of 5-α-reductase (5αR),
attenuation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and
blocking of α-adrenoreceptors. Inhibitors of 5-α-reductase
(Finasteride) suppress conversion of testosterone into
a more potent metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone
(DHT). The second strategy depends on suppression of
gonadotrophin secretion, which otherwise stimulates
testosterone production. Lastly, alpha-1-blockers inhibit
the effect of noradrenaline on prostate smooth muscle

development of BPH [12]. Animal models of BPH are
based on prostate overstimulation by these hormones
[13, 14]. In testosterone-induced model, administration
of testosterone causes hyperplasia in ventral lobes of
the rat prostate, analogous to morphological changes in
human BPH [15-17]. In sulpiride-induced model, sulpiride
stimulates prolactin production by the pituitary gland,
thus causing hyperplasia in the lateral and dorsal prostate
lobes. Levels of serum prolactin are increased with age.
Therefore, the sulpiride model is closely related to BPH
in humans [18]. Here we compared therapeutic effects of
5αR inhibitor Finasteride, commonly used in BPH therapy,
and Rapatar in two rat models of BPH.

of lateral and dorsal lobes because these lobes are enlarged
by sulpiride [14], [19]. Sulpiride increased weight of
lateral and dorsal lobes (Figure 1B). At all 3 doses used,
Rapatar prevented the effect of sulpiride. At dose 3.0 mg/
kg, the weight of the lobes was even lower than the weight
in control group (Figure 1B).

Rapatar normalized prostate gland structure
The rat prostate gland has tubuloacinar structure
(Figure 2A, 2E). The acini are lined with epithelium and
surrounded by loose, fibrous connective tissue containing
smooth-muscle fibers and blood vessels. The acini located
along the periphery of the lobe are smaller, but their walls
are more folded. The epithelial cells of the acinar lining
are cylindrical, prismatic or cuboidal with a basal nucleus.
The dorsal and lateral lobes are located tightly against each
other to the extent that they appear macroscopically as a
single lobe. But a very thin connective-tissue septum can
be used to distinguish between them microscopically. The
acini of the lateral and dorsal lobes are smaller than those
of the ventral lobes and have a more pronounced degree of
folding (Figure 2A, 2E). As small acini areas are located
in the gland section irregularly, the stroma and small acini
percentage assessment may depends on the occasional or
subjective investigator choice of the sites (Figure 3A).
To prevent the bias, we analyzed entire lobe sections
scanned in full scale and overlaid with a grid in order
to estimate the relative stroma and acini areas (Figure
3B). We did not reveal any change in the relative stroma
areas in bothTestosterone-induced (Figure 2А, 2B) and
sulpiride-induced BPH (Figure 2E, 2F, Table 2). In both
testosterone- and in Sulpiride-induced BPH, adenomatous

RESULTS
Rapatar prevents hypertrophy in sulpirideinduced BPH
In testosterone group, testosterone-filled silastic
tubes were implanted subcutaneously (Table 1). In
sulpiride group, hyperprolactinemia was induced by daily
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of sulpiride. On day 5,
animals were given either Rapatar or Finasteride or left
untreated (Table 1).
Testosterone induced a 1.6-fold increase in the
ventral lobe weight (Figure 1A). Finasteride but not
Rapatar prevented weight gain of prostate lobes. Yet,
as shown in our study (below), Rapatar prevented
hyperplastic and degenerative histological abnormalities
and inflammation caused by testosterone.
In sulpiride-induced model, we analyzed the weight

hyperplasia was manifested by an increased proportion of
small acini surrounding large glands (Figure 2B, 2F, Table
2), in agreement with previous results [17]. In sulpirideinduced BPH, proportion of small acini was 40±2.4%,
compared with 21±1%, in control. In Testosterone-induced
BPH, there was 1.75 fold increase of small acini portion in
the ventral lobes: from 21.2±2.9 % to 37.2±2.1 % (Table
2).
In sulpiride-induced BPH, Rapatar caused
normalization of prostate gland structure (Figure 2G).
Percent of small acini in the lateral lobes decreased to
15.1±1.5%, 18.6±2.2% and 18.4±2.3% at doses of 0.5,
1.5 or 3 mg/kg (versus 40.6±2.4% for Sulpiride alone
and 21±1% in control group) (Table 2). Similar, in

testosterone-induced BPH, Rapatar caused normalization
of gland structures (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast,
Finasteride did not decrease a number of small acini in
either sulpiride- or testosterone-induced BPH (Figure 2D,
H, Table 2).

Rapatar reduced papillary projections and
hyperplasia in testosterone-induced BPH
Hyperplasia of the acinar wall epithelium induced
by testosterone in ventral lobes was manifested not only
by adenomatous hyperplasia, but also by proliferation of
the epithelial cells in the form of papillary projections,

protruding into the lumina of the acini (focal hyperplasia)
and by the appearance of multilayered epithelium areas of
varying length along the acinar wall (diffuse hyperplasia or
hyperplastic nodule) [13, 15]. Papillary projections could
be distinguished from acinar wall folds, which often occur
naturally, as the basal membrane also forms a fold within
the fold of the acinar wall (Figure 4A). In contrast, there
is no basal membrane in the papillary projections (Figure
4B). The number of papillary projections and amount of
diffuse hyperplasia were estimated on the same section

on which the proportion of small acini was determined. A
ten-fold rise in the average number of focal proliferation
(both of papillary and diffuse) was observed in the ventral
lobes in Testosterone-BPH). Rapatar at doses 0.5, 1.5, and
3.0 mg/kg (TBPH + R 0.5; TBPH + R 1.5; TBPH + R 3.0),
reduced this focal proliferation 2.5-, 9.9- and 42.1-fold,
respectively.

Rapatar prevents inflammation in prostate glands
in sulpiride-induced BPH

in 4 of 10 animals of this group (Figure 5B). Stromal
leukocyte infiltration was also found in 33% of the animals
after exposure to Finasteride. Leukocyte infiltration of the
stroma was observed only in 2 out of 10 animals treated
with Rapatar at 0.5mg/kg dose. Inflammation was not
found in any rats treated with Rapatar at doses of 1.5 and
3.0 mg/kg (Figure 5C).

There was no leukocyte infiltration of the stroma
and acini in control rats. Sulpiride induced leukocyte
infiltration in prostate gland tissue (Figure 5A). Signs of
non-bacterial prostatitis at the lateral lobes were observed

Rapamycin decreases body weight gain in S-BPH

degenerating epithelium, surrounding by foci of small
acinar proliferation. So although Finasteride decreased
weight of the prostate lobes, this decrease was in part
due to degeneration. In contrast, Rapatar prevented
degeneration and normalized the tissue structure.
Noteworthy, the expression of androgen receptors
depends mainly on testosterone in the dorsal/ventral lobes
and on prolactin in lateral lobes [24], [25]. Therefore, both
stimulating effects of Sulpiride and inhibitory (therapeutic)
effects of Rapatar were mainly evident in lateral lobes.
We emphasize that sulpiride-induced BPH is
a physiological model related to human BPH. First,
levels of prolactin are increased in men with aging. The
sulpiride model reproduces the hormonal background on
which BPH develops in aged men. Second, lateral lobes
are mainly involved in human BPH. Lateral PG lobes
in rats and in men are most similar in their embryonic
development, structure and function. Therefore, prevention
of S-BPH by Rapatar in rats suggests that Rapatar will be
most likely effective in BPH in men.
In men, BPH is accompanied by inflammation in
the stroma and by advances to suppurative exudate in the
acinar lumen. Similar alterations were observed in rats
treated with testosterone and sulpiride, in agreement with
previous reports [12, 14].
Rapatar decreased sulpiride-induced inflammation.
In fact, rapamycin has anti-inflammatory activity [26- 28].
Finasteride reduced lobe weight due to loss of
secreting epithelial cells in the acini, while Rapatar had a
milder effect, inhibiting secretion of preserved secreting
epithelium. Therefore, Rapatar and Finasteride could be
combined for therapy of BPH. This needs additional study.
Finasteride can cause anti-androgen resistance,
producing hormone-resistant tumors. In contrast,

During the experiment, rats gained significant
weight. This weight gain is explained by housing of each
rat in individual cage that reduces stress and is commonly
associated with weight gain. The same weight gain was
observed in control BPH groups and in BPH groups
treated with Finasteride (Figure 6). In S-BPH, Rapatar
partially prevented weight gain. This effect was dose
dependent (Figure 6). At doses 1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg,
Rapatar decreased weight by 13% and 17, respectively
(Figure 6). It was previously reported that rapamycin
decreased obesity in rodents on high-fat diet [20-23].

DISCUSSION
Here we showed that, in a dose-dependent manner,
Rapatar (a new oral formulation of rapamycin) prevented
sulpiride-induced BPH. Sulpiride induced cystic enlarged
acini, with atrophic and degenerative changes, loss of
secretion and destruction of the epithelial lining. In this
model, Rapatar normalized both the weight of prostate
lobes and their tissue architecture. Rapatar decreased the
cystic transformation of acini caused by sulpiride. Most
of the acini were lined with secretory epithelium. In the
surrounding area, a fewer number of small acini were
observed. Thus, Rapatar abrogated prostate enlargement.
Rapatar also prevented pathological histological
alterations caused by testosterone, while minimally
affecting the lobes weight.
Effects of Finasteride on gland tissue in Sulpirideinduced and testosterone-induced BPH were similar.

Experimental groups

rapamycin prevents numerous types of cancer in rodents
and humans [8-10]. In addition, rapamycin prolongs life
span and prevents age-related diseases in mice [29-34].
Therefore, Rapatar has a number of advantages as
a potential agent for prevention and treatment of BPH in
men. Given that rapamycin is a clinically approved drug,
clinical trials of Rapatar for treatment and prevention of
BPH are warranted.

Treatment schedules for experimental groups are
shown in Table 1.

Testosterone-induced BPH (T-BPH)
Groups 2-8: rats were implanted subcutaneously
over the scapular region with testosterone-filled Silastic
tubes containing 40 mg of testosterone as described [42].
In control group 1, the Silastic tubes were implanted
without testosterone. On day 5 after tube implantation,
rats (groups 3-8) were given either Rapatar (doses 0.5, 1.5
and 3.0 mg/kg, three times a week) or Finasteride (dose
10 mg/kg, three times a week). Both drugs were diluted in
0.2 % HPMC and given by gavage for 30 days. Animals in
groups 1 and 2 (T-Control and T-BPH) were gavaged with
the solvent (Table 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Animal studies were performed in accordance with
the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the Ethics Committee at the State-Funded Institution, N.
N. Blokhin CRC, and done in accordance with the Geneva
Convention of 1985 regarding international principles for
biomedical research involving the use of animals, and
with the 2000 revision of the Declaration of Helsinki
concerning the humane treatment of animals.
Male Wistar rats (240-280 g) were kept in standard
conditions with unrestricted access to food and drinking
water. Rats were randomized, marked, weighed and
housed individually. They were provided ad libitum with
water and a standard laboratory chow. Body weight was
measured twice a week at the same time (9:00–11:00 am).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sulpiride-induced BPH (S-BPH)
Hyperprolactinemia was induced by daily
intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg Sulpiride (diluted
in 0.2 % HPMC) for 28 days, as described [12]. On day
5 after the start of Sulpiride injections, rats (groups 7-12)
were gavaged daily either with Rapatar (S-BPH +R 0.5;
S-BPH +R 1.5; S-BPH +R 3.0) three times a week or by
Finasteride (S-BPH +F10) for 30 days. Animals in groups
7 and 8 (S-Control and S-BPH) were gavaged with the

solvent (Table 1).

When estimating the papillary projections, the latter were
differentiated from normally occurring acinar wall folds
in which the basal membrane exists (Fig.4). In contrast,
there is no basal membrane in the papillary projection.
Rather, the cells of the cuboidal epithelium located close
to the basal membrane are smaller and more basophilic,
forming sites of focal proliferation. In addition to the total
number of papillary projections, their multiplicity was
also determined. For this, the total number of papillary
projections was divided by the number of acini in the
section.

Necropsy and histology
Necropsy and removal of the prostate gland for
histological evaluation were performed at day 35. The
prostate lobes were dissected and weighed, and their
volume was measured. The tissues were processed for light
microscopy by fixing in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
dehydrating, and embedding in paraffin. Histological
analysis was performed on serial sections obtained from
prostatic lobes stained by hematoxylin-eosin.

Inflammation

Assessment of the stromal component and small
acini portions in the whole PG section

In the case of inflammation, leukocyte infiltration
of the stroma was observed and documented. An account
was made of the number of animals in a group having this
change.

Fifteen sections of the analyzed lobe of the prostate
were examined microscopically and 1 section was selected
as being the most representative for the animal. The
chosen section was scanned in full scale and overlaid with
a grid in order to estimate the area of the stroma on the
entire examined section (Figure 3B).
The known area of each square (0.06 mm2) makes
it possible to determine the area occupied by the entire
section and separately by the stroma and to calculate the
number of small acini (those measuring less than 0.06
mm2) in the section as a whole.
One of the methods for evaluation of hyperplastic
changes is based on measurement of the surface occupied
by acinar epithelium in a microscopic view field [19].
The estimation results may depend considerably on the
subjective choice of the site by the investigator (Figure
3A). We determined the proportion of small acini within
the area of the whole section using scanned in full scale
section overlaid with a grid. At low magnification, the
total number of acini is evaluated in the sections, as well
as the number of small acini (less than 0.06 mm2 in size).
The percentage of the small acini to the total number is
calculated and this parameter corresponds closely to the
area of the acinar epithelium and reflects the development
of hyperplasia in an objective way.

Statistical analysis
Prostate weight relative to the body weight.
Significance was determined using Student’s t-test.
Significance in inflammation frequency in different groups
