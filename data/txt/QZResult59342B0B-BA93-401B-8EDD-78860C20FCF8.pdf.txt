SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

The tumor stroma is believed to contribute to some of the most malignant characteristics of
epithelial tumors. However, signaling between stromal and tumor cells is complex and remains
poorly understood. Here we show that the genetic inactivation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts of
mouse mammary glands accelerated the initiation, progression and malignant transformation of
mammary epithelial tumors. This was associated with the massive remodeling of the extra-cellular
matrix (ECM), innate immune cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis. Loss of Pten in stromal
fibroblasts led to increased expression, phosphorylation (T72) and recruitment of Ets2 to target
promoters known to be involved in these processes. Remarkably, Ets2 inactivation in Pten stromadeleted tumors ameliorated disruption of the tumor microenvironment and was sufficient to
decrease tumor growth and progression. Global gene expression profiling of mammary stromal
cells identified a Pten-specific signature that was highly represented in the tumor stroma of breast
cancer patients. These findings identify the Pten-Ets2 axis as a critical stroma-specific signaling
pathway that suppresses mammary epithelial tumors.

Author Manuscript

Coordinated signaling between different cell types of the ‘normal stroma’ is required during
embryonic and adult development1. The stroma can be appropriately activated in response
to extreme but normal physiological cues, such as wounding, inflammation or pregnancy2.
The stroma can also be inappropriately activated in cancer3,4. In breast tumors, stromal
fibroblasts are believed to adapt and continuously co-evolve along with tumor epithelial
cells in order to foster transformation and tumor growth5. Fibroblasts are a principal
constituent of the stroma responsible for the synthesis of growth and survival factors,
angiogenic and immunological chemokines, and structural components of the ECM as well
as enzymes that control its turnover6,7. Despite extensive evidence for a role of the tumor
stroma in carcinogenesis, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways involved in
the communication between the different cellular compartments of the microenvironment
that contribute to the cancer phenotype.

Author Manuscript

Alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are associated with the
activation of tumor-associated stroma8, 9. One of the main regulators of PI3K signaling is
the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor with lipid and protein
phosphatase activity10, 11. PTEN inactivation disrupts multiple cellular processes
associated with cell polarity, cell architecture, chromosomal integrity, cell cycle progression,
cell growth and stem cell self–renewal12, 13. Germ-line inactivation of a single allele of
PTEN in both humans and mice contributes to the genesis of a variety of tumor types of
epithelial origin14. While tremendous progress in understanding PTEN function in tumor
cells has been made since its discovery over a decade ago, relatively little is known about its
potential role in the tumor stroma. Here, we show that Pten ablation in mammary stromal
fibroblasts of mice results in massive remodeling of the ECM and tumor vasculature,
recruitment of innate immune cells, and increased malignancy of mammary epithelial

tumors. Gene expression profiling of Pten-deleted stromal fibroblasts identified an Ets2–
specific transcription program associated with many of these aggressive tumor phenotypes.
Remarkably, the concomitant inactivation of Ets2 in the mammary stroma reversed the
increased malignancy caused by Pten deficiency. These findings expand Pten’s repertoire as
a tumor suppressor by identifying the fibroblast as a key site from which it exerts its
powerful tumor suppressive influence on the adjacent tumor epithelium.

RESULTS
Pten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary tumors of epithelial origin

Author Manuscript

To rigorously evaluate the role of Pten in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer we
generated mice containing a mesenchymal-specific Fsp-cre transgene15 and conditional
alleles of Pten (PtenloxP; Supplementary Fig. 1). Cell type-marker analysis using a βgalactosidase Rosa26LoxP reporter allele showed specific Fsp-cre expression in stromal
fibroblasts surrounding the mammary epithelial ducts, with no expression in cytokeratinpositive epithelial cells, F4/80-positive macrophages and CD31-positive endothelial cells
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2a, 2b). Western blot and PCR assays demonstrated efficient
cre-mediated deletion of PtenloxP in stromal fibroblasts isolated from Fsp-cre;PtenloxP/loxP
mammary glands (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3a). Examination of mammary sections by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed deletion of PtenloxP that
was confined to stromal fibroblasts, with no collateral deletion in epithelial ducts or the
adjacent myoepithelium (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3b, 3c). Interestingly, this resulted in
the expansion of the ECM, but did not lead to the transformation of the mammary
epithelium (Fig 1c, 1e).

We then examined the role of stromal Pten on mammary tumorigenesis using an established
mouse model of breast cancer, MMTV-ErbB2/neu (ErbB2)16. To avoid possible
confounding effects caused by Pten deletion in mesenchymal cells of other organs,
mammary glands from Fsp-cre;PtenloxP/loxP, ErbB2;PtenloxP/loxP and ErbB2;Fspcre;PtenloxP/loxP donors were transplanted into syngeneic wild-type recipients17 and tumor
development was monitored over the course of several months. By genetically marking the
stroma with the Rosa26LoxP reporter allele, we demonstrated that both the epithelium and its
associated stroma were effectively transplanted into host female mice (Supplementary Fig.
4). Loss of Pten in stromal fibroblasts dramatically increased the incidence of ErbB2-driven
mammary tumors (Fig. 1d–f). By 16 weeks post-transplantation, these lesions progressed to
adenoma, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma (Fig. 1g) and by 26 weeks most females
met the criteria for early removal due to excessive tumor burden (Fig. 1e). Histological
examination showed that ErbB2-tumor cells in Pten stromal-deleted tumors retained their
typical oncogene-specific morphology, with small nuclei, fine chromatin and abundant
eosinophilic cytoplasm18. In contrast to non-deleted tumors 18,19, Pten stromal-deleted
tumors had a significant amount of stroma surrounding and infiltrating the epithelial masses
(Fig. 1g). PCR-based and immunohistochemical assays confirmed that tumors had intact
PtenloxP alleles in the epithelial compartment (Supplementary Fig. 5a, 5b and data not
shown). Moreover, we used the Rosa26loxP reporter allele to genetically mark early EMT
events15 and found no evidence of EMT in tumors that either contained or lacked Pten in

stromal fibroblasts (data not shown). Thus, the analysis of the ErbB2 breast cancer tumor
model identified a potent tumor suppressor role for Pten in stromal fibroblasts of the
mammary gland.
Pten in stromal fibroblasts controls ECM and innate immune functions

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the tumor suppressive mechanism of Pten action in stromal fibroblasts, we
profiled the transcriptome of mammary stromal fibroblasts isolated from PtenloxP/loxP and
Fsp-cre;PtenloxP/loxP females. Details of sample collection, processing of Affymetrix oligoarrays and expression data are available in the Methods and Supplementary Methods
sections. Briefly, we implemented class comparison analyses of all probe sets on the
Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array to identify genes differentially expressed between
the two genetic groups. We also used an unbiased approach similar to Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis20 to identify a priori defined groups of genes that were significantly differentially
expressed. The analysis of over 14,000 mouse genes identified 129 upregulated and 21
downregulated unique genes in response to Pten deletion (Supplementary Fig. 6a, 6b; >4fold at p <0.001; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Quantitative RT-PCR assays on a subset of
genes confirmed >85% of these expression changes using independent fibroblast samples
(Supplementary Fig. 6c, and Supplementary Table 3). Fibroblast samples used to probe the
oligo-arrays lacked expression of macrophage-, endothelial- and epithelial-specific genes,
confirming the purity of these fibroblast preparations (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Functional
annotation21,22 (GO) of Pten-responsive targets revealed a remarkable bias toward genes
encoding proteins involved in ECM remodeling, wound healing and chronic
inflammation21,22 (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Given this unexpected
convergence of function, we performed a more thorough cellular and molecular analysis of
Pten-deleted stroma. Staining of consecutive mammary gland sections with H&E and
Mason’s trichrome stains indicated enhanced deposition of collagen in Pten-deleted stroma,
which was independent of ErbB2-oncogene expression (Fig. 2b, 2c, and Supplementary Fig.
7a). IHC and Western blot assays using collagen type-specific antibodies showed that the
non-cellular material consisted mostly of type-I collagen and not the basement membrane
type-IV collagen (Fig. 2b, 2c, and Supplementary Fig. 7b, 7c). There was significant
infiltration of F4/80-positive macrophages into stromal Pten-deleted mammary glands (Fig.
2d, 2e), and this was also independent of ErbB2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 8a). The
abundance of B- and T- cells did not change in response to stromal deletion of Pten (data not
shown). From these experiments we conclude that ablation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts
recapitulates two key events associated with tumor malignancy: increased ECM deposition
and innate immune cell infiltration.

Loss of stromal Pten activates an Ets2-dependent transcriptional program
Along with the remarkable remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, loss of Pten in
stromal fibroblasts resulted in activation of the Ras, JNK and Akt pathways. Western blot
analysis using protein lysates derived from Pten-deleted stromal fibroblasts demonstrated an
increase in the phospho-specific forms of Akt (T308 and S473) and JNK (T183 and Y185)
(Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 8b). Immunohistochemical assays confirmed the activation of
Akt and JNK in stromal fibroblasts, and interestingly, also revealed a profound activation of
these two pathways in ductal epithelial cells adjacent to the Pten-deleted stroma (Fig. 2g;

Supplementary Fig. 8b). This analysis also showed increased levels of phospho-Erk1/2 in
Pten-deleted stromal fibroblasts, however, this increase could not be detected in primary
cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 2f, 2g), presumably due to the constitutive Pten-independent
activation of Erk1/2 by serum-stimulation23.

Author Manuscript

Among the many expression changes observed in Pten-deleted stromal fibroblasts we noted
that there was a significant increase of Ets2 mRNA levels (2.8 fold, p <0.001). This
induction is notable because the Ets2 transcription factor is known to be transcriptionally
induced by MAPK24,25 activation and its function to be post-translationally enhanced by
the Akt- and JNK-mediated phosphorylation of its pointed domain at threonine 72
(Ets2T72)23,26. We confirmed the higher levels of Ets2 mRNA and protein in Pten-deleted
fibroblasts (~3-fold, p<0.001; Supplementary Fig. 9a, 9b) and consistent with the activation
of Akt and JNK in these mammary glands, there was a marked increase of P-Ets2T72 in
stromal fibroblasts and adjacent epithelial ducts (Fig. 2h, 2i). Loss of Pten in stromal
fibroblasts resulted in the induction of a number of genes involved in ECM remodeling and
macrophage recruitment, two of which, Mmp9 and Ccl3, are known to be direct
transcriptional targets of Ets227,28 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, 6c). The increase of Mmp9
expression appears to be of pathological relevance since in situ zymography29 showed
robust Mmp9 activity in tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed an increase in the loading of Ets2 onto the
Mmp9 and Ccl3 promoters in Pten-deleted mammary fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 9e),
suggesting a direct role for Ets2 in the transcriptional regulation of these two target genes in
vivo. Together, these data illustrate the extensive molecular reprogramming that takes place
in the tumor and its microenvironment in response to ablation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts.

Stromal Ets2 promotes mammary tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Ets2 promotes a microenvironment conducive to tumor growth we
analyzed the consequences of ablating a conditional allele of Ets2 (Ets2loxP)30 in mammary
stromal fibroblasts of a well-characterized mouse model of breast cancer, MMTV-PyMT
(PyMT)31. The PyMT oncogene initiates the rapid onset and progression of mammary
tumors and thus represents an appropriate model for evaluating any potential delay that loss
of Ets2 might have on tumorigenesis. The efficient Fsp-cre mediated ablation of Ets2 in
stromal fibroblasts was facilitated by using mice carrying conventional and conditional
knockout alleles of Ets2 (DNA-binding domain-Ets2db/LoxP)32 (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig.
10a, 10b). Ablation of Ets2 in these cells had no detectable physiological consequence on
the development of mammary glands, either during puberty or pregnancy (MCO,
unpublished observations). The evaluation of PyMT;Fsp-cre;Ets2db/loxP and control
PyMT;Ets2db/loxP mice over a period of three months showed that ablation of Ets2 in
mammary fibroblasts significantly reduced the tumor load (Fig. 3b) and slowed progression
to adenoma and early carcinoma (Fig. 3c). Quantitative RT-PCR showed high levels of
Mmp9 expression in tumor-associated fibroblasts containing Ets2 and low levels in Ets2deleted fibroblasts (Fig. 3e). Because Mmp9 activity is known to mediate the release of
matrix-bound VEGF-A to its active isoforms, including VEGF16433, we visualized the
spatial distribution of VEGF164 and Mmp9 activity by IF. These assays showed that the
accumulation of VEGF164, which was particularly acute within collagen1A-rich stromal

locations overlapping Mmp9 activity, was significantly decreased in stromal-deleted Ets2
tumors (Fig. 3d, 3f). Given that VEGF164 is a specific ligand for VEGF Receptor 2
(VEGFR2; FLK-1; KDR), one of the most potent mediators of VEGF-induced endothelial
signaling and angiogenesis34, we also evaluated VEGFR2 status by immuno-staining tumor
sections with antibodies specific for CD31 and the phospho-activated form of the murine
VEGF receptor (P-VEGFR2Y1173)35. This analysis revealed a four-fold decrease in the
number of CD31/VEGFR2Y1173 double-positive cells in Ets2-deleted versus non-deleted
tumor samples (Fig. 3f, 3g). Together, these data show that loss of Ets2 in stromal
fibroblasts results in decreased Mmp9 activity in the tumor ECM and reduced
VEGFR2Y1173-activation in the tumor vasculature.
Loss of Ets2 diminishes tumor formation in Pten stromal-deleted mammary glands

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We then entertained the hypothesis that Ets2 may be contributing to the remodeling of the
tumor microenvironment caused by stromal deletion of Pten. To directly test this possibility,
we compared tumor incidence in PtenloxP/loxP, Fsp-cre;PtenloxP/loxP and Fspcre;PtenloxP/loxP;Ets2db/loxP mammary glands that were orthotopically injected with an
established ErbB2-initiated mammary tumor cell line (NT 2.5)36. This orthotopic model
recapitulated the consequences of deleting Pten in the mammary stroma that were observed
in the genetically engineered ErbB2-mouse model described earlier in this study. Indeed,
tumor incidence and tumor load in injected Fsp-cre;PtenloxP/loxP females was markedly
higher than in control PtenloxP/loxP females (Fig. 4a, 4b). Importantly, mammary glands
doubly deleted for stromal Pten and Ets2 had fewer and smaller tumors than glands deleted
for Pten only. These mammary tumors had decreased number of macrophages and
recruitment of new vasculature (Fig. 4c–f). Loss of Pten and Ets2, however, failed to fully
reduce the tumor load and collagen deposition to control levels (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig.
11a, 11b), suggesting that additional effectors must contribute towards Pten’s tumor
suppressor functions. From these data, we conclude that Ets2 is a major component of the
Pten tumor suppressive axis that acts in the stromal fibroblast compartment of mammary
glands.
Mouse fibroblast Pten-signature distinguishes normal from tumor stroma in breast cancer
patients

Author Manuscript

To determine the relevance of these findings to human breast cancer, we compared the
mouse stromal fibroblast Pten-expression signature to the expression signatures derived
from laser-captured tumor stroma (49 samples) and adjacent normal stroma (52 samples) in
breast cancer patients37. This analysis identified 137 human orthologs from the 150
differentially expressed mouse genes detected by the Affymetrix oligo-arrays shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6b. Of these 137 orthologs, 129 genes were represented in the
expression platform used (Agilent) for the analysis of human patient stroma samples37.
Only 70 of these 129 genes had highly variable gene expression across all human stromal
samples (a variance cutoff of >0.5). The heat map generated for the human stroma dataset
showed that this 70 gene-subset derived form the mouse Pten-signature was sufficient to
distinguish normal from tumor stroma in all patients (Fig. 5a; p = 8e−5 as determined by a
permutation test). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) also discriminated normal from
tumor stroma perfectly (p<1e−10; Supplementary Fig. 12). Interestingly, 12 of the 70 human

orthologs identified by the Pten-signature (Fig. 5a: gene names highlighted in red;
Supplementary Fig. 13) were previously shown to be differentially expressed in the tumor
stroma of breast cancer patients and to be associated with recurrence37 (Fig. 5b; p = 2.5e−8,
Fisher’s Exact Analysis). These analyses suggest that the fibroblast Pten-expression
signature identified by our stroma mouse model represents a significant subset of the total
gene signature expressed in the stroma of human breast cancer. We interpret these results to
mean that a portion of the transcriptome regulated by Pten in mammary stromal fibroblasts
is dysregulated in the tumor stroma of breast cancer patients.

Author Manuscript

We also evaluated the relevance of the Pten Ets2 relationship in human cancer by
immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) with antibodies
specific for Pten, P-Ets2T72 and P-AktS473 (Fig. 5c). From the analysis of 99 patient samples
with invasive carcinoma, Pten expression was scored as absent or low in approximately fifty
percent of samples. Importantly, Pten staining in the TMAs was negatively correlated with
P-AktS473 and nuclear P-Ets2T72, whereas P-AktS473 and nuclear P-Ets2T72 showed a
positive association (Fig. 5d). These results suggest that activation of P-Ets2T72 in human
breast cancer stroma is a pathologic event that is favored by a reduction in Pten expression.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Histopathology and molecular studies suggest that malignant tumors consist of a complex
cellular system that is dependent on reciprocal signaling between tumor cells and the
adjacent stroma. However, the signaling pathways that mediate the communication between
the various cell types in the tumor remain virtually unknown. We recently developed a
mesenchymal-specific cre mouse15 and used it here to examine the consequences of
inactivating Pten in mammary stromal fibroblasts. Using this system we show, for the first
time, that Pten in stromal fibroblasts has a critical role in the suppression of epithelial
mammary tumors that is, in part, mediated through an Ets2-regulated transcriptional
program.

Author Manuscript

The tumor suppressor functions of PTEN have been extensively studied in the tumor cell38–
40. We show here that genetic ablation of Pten in mammary stromal fibroblasts of mice
alters the expression profile of these cells to increase ECM, chemokine and cytokine
production in the tumor microenvironment. As a result, Pten stromal-deleted tumors exhibit
high levels of collagen, macrophage recruitment and vascular networks, which together
favor the initiation and progression of mammary epithelial tumors. Remarkably, side-byside evaluation of histopathology by independent pathologists could not distinguish tumors
between Pten stromal-deleted mice and human breast cancer patients, highlighting the
importance of modeling stromal cell compartments of the tumor microenvironment. The
mechanism by which Pten in the stroma exerts its tumor suppressor role likely involves the
control of multiple signaling pathways, including components of the Ras, Akt and JNK
networks, which together culminate in the regulation of Ets2 transcriptional activity. The
fact that loss of Ets2 in mammary stromal fibroblasts diminished the oncogenic
consequences of deleting Pten in these cells underscores the importance of the stromal PtenEts2 axis in stromal fibroblasts during tumor suppression. These observations are consistent
with previous work from Oshima and colleagues that showed a critical cell non-autonomous

role for Ets2 in the growth of mammary tumors in mice41 and with the identification of Ets2
activation as a key event associated with breast cancer in human patients having poor
prognosis42–44. The relevance of this mouse Pten-Ets2 tumor suppressor axis to breast
cancer is underligned by the high correspondence between the mouse and human stromal
expression signatures. The observation that the dire consequences of targeting this Ets2driven stromal program are tumor-specific, sparing normal mammary development,
emphasizes the potential utility of stromal-specific strategies for therapeutic intervention in
human breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

In summary, this work identifies Pten-Ets2 as a key regulatory axis in stromal fibroblasts
that suppresses mammary epithelial tumors by profoundly attenuating some of the most
malignant characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. This novel function of Pten may
be relevant in the suppression of epithelial tumors of other organs, but may also extend
beyond cancer, to conditions where the microenvironment may impact disease
manifestation, such as in autoimmune syndromes45, lung fibrosis46 and
neurodegeneration47. Interestingly, the stromal Pten expression signature identified here
includes genes that have been causally linked to ECM deposition and inflammation in
rheumatoid arthritis, lung fibrosis and neurodegeneration (Supplementary Table 1 and Table
2). These data offer a molecular basis for how altered Pten signaling in the tumor stroma
may elicit broad responses in a variety of cells in the tumor microenvironment that
contribute to disease manifestation.

METHODS SUMMARY
Transgenic mice

Author Manuscript

Generation of Fsp-cre mice has been described15. PtenloxP mice were created following the
strategy described in Supplementary Fig. 1. Ets2loxP mice were generated by standard
techniques30. Animals were maintained and euthanized following institutional guidelines.
Tenth generation congenic (N10) FVB/N animals were used for transplantation and
orthotopic injection studies.
Tissue processing, histology
Tissues were either embedded in OCT or fixed (4% PFA or formalin) and embedded in
paraffin. Frozen sections were used for X-gal staining as previously described15. IHC on
tissue microarray sections from 99 breast carcinoma patients were scored using Allred
score’s system48.
Isolation of primary mammary fibroblasts

Author Manuscript

Primary mammary fibroblasts were purified following the protocol published previously
with minor modifications49. Mammary glands were dissected from 8 week-old female mice,
minced and digested with collagenase (0.15% Collagenase I, 160 U/ml Hyaluonidase, 1
μg/ml hydrocortisone and 10 μg/ml insulin with penicillin and streptomycin) in a 5% CO2
incubator overnight at 37°C. Collagenase was neutralized with 10% FBS-DMEM medium.
Digested tissue was resuspended in medium and subjected to gravity for 12–15 min. Pellets

Figure 5. Pten-signature is represented in breast cancer stroma

Author Manuscript

(a) Heat map displaying the expression of the human orthologs of the 70-gene subset in
normal- and tumor-stroma from human breast cancer patients. The 70-gene subset derived
from the mouse Pten-signature includes 57 genes upregulated (denoted by red bar on the yaxis) and 13 genes downregulated (denoted by the green bar on the y-axis). Red and green
regions inside the heat map indicate relative gene expression levels (red, increased and
green, decreased). The p-value indicates the ability of the mouse 70-gene signature to
partition normal and tumor stroma in breast cancer patients (see Statistical Methods). The
coded patient IDs are listed at the bottom.
(b) Venn diagram depicting the overlap between the mouse Pten-deleted fibroblast and
human stroma microarray data sets. The 12 genes highlighted in red (Fig. 5a, right margin)
are common between the mouse Pten 70 gene-signature and the human 163-gene signature
that has been shown to associate with recurrence38. This overlap is highly significant (pvalue=2.5e−8; Fisher’s Exact Test).
