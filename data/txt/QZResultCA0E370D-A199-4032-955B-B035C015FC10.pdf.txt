Abstract
Their antiangiogenic effects make vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2) inhibitors useful for cancer treatment. However, most of these drugs have
unexpected adverse side effects. Here, we show that the novel VEGFR2 inhibitor
YLL545 suppressed tumor angiogenesis and growth in triple-negative breast cancer
without adverse effects. YLL545 treatment also markedly inhibited proliferation,
migration, invasion, and tube formation by human umbilical vascular endothelial
cells (HUVECs) in vitro. These effects of YLL545 were equal to or greater than those
seen with sorafenib. In addition, YLL545 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of
VEGFR2 and activation of downstream signaling regulators, such as phospho-STAT3
and phospho-ERK1/2, in HUVECs. Embryonic angiogenesis assays in zebrafish and
Matrigel plug assays in mice demonstrated that YLL545 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo.
YLL545 also inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and 50 mg/kg/d YLL545 inhibited human
tumor xenograft growth by more than 50% in BALB/c nude mice. These observations
suggest YLL545 is a potentially useful anticancer drug candidate.

INTRODUCTION

and acquire drug resistance, antiangiogenic therapy may
have many advantages [5, 6].
Of all the known angiogenic molecules, vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the best-characterized
modulator of angiogenesis and metastatic growth in
human carcinogenesis [7, 8]. VEGF exerts its biological
effects by binding to and activating its receptors
(VEGFRs). In endothelial cells, VEGFR2 is the major
effector of VEGF-stimulated cell survival and vascular
permeability during angiogenesis [9, 10]. Activation of
VEGFR2 leads to phosphorylation of specific downstream
signal transduction mediators, such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mechanistic target of

Angiogenesis is characterized by the formation of
new, irregular blood vessels from a preexisting vascular
network and is one of the hallmarks of cancer. This
process involves the coordination of many bioactive
molecules and is required for the growth, survival, and
metastasis of most solid tumors, including breast cancer
[1, 2]. Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive
subtype of breast cancer for which treatment options
are limited when chemotherapy is unsuccessful [3, 4].
Therapies that block angiogenesis may help inhibit tumor
growth and metastasis. Compared to chemotherapy, which
is hindered by the ability of cancer cells to mutate rapidly

rapamycin (mTOR) [11-13]. Therefore, VEGFR2 is an
important target for antiangiogenic cancer therapies.
A number of small molecule VEGFR2 inhibitors have
been reported, and some have been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration, including sorafenib,
sunitinib, and vandetanib [14-16]. Moreover, novel small
molecule VEGFR2 inhibitors, such as isoliquiritigenin and
NBM-T-BMX-OS0118, are currently under clinical and
preclinical evaluation [17, 18]. However, adverse effects
such as bleeding complications [19] have been observed
in patients treated with these drugs, indicating that safer
VEGFR2 inhibitors are still needed.
In an effort to discover more potent VEGFR2
inhibitors that specifically block VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling with little or no toxicity, we used rational
medicinal chemistry methods to design a series of
inhibitors derived from sorafenib. Here, we examined the
ability of one of these novel small molecules, YLL545, to
inhibit VEGFR2. Our findings suggest YLL545 is a welltolerated novel compound that potently inhibits VEGFR2
and may suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer.

proliferation,

To assess its antiangiogenic activity in vitro, we
examined the effect of YLL545 on VEGF-induced
proliferation in HUVECs using CCK-8 assays. YLL545
inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation with an
IC50 of 5.884 μM (Figure 2A and S1). Moreover, EdU
incorporation assays demonstrated that the percentage
of proliferating HUVECs decreased after treatment with
2.5 μM YLL545 (Figure 2B). Given that endothelial cell
migration and invasion are essential for angiogenesis, we
carried out wound healing assays to investigate the effect
of YLL545 on HUVEC migration. As shown in Figure 2C,

YLL545 functions via VEGFR2-dependent and
-independent pathways

2.5 μM YLL545 strongly inhibited HUVEC migration; 5
μM sorafenib inhibited cell migration to a similar degree.
Transwell invasion assays further revealed that YLL545
dose-dependently inhibited invasive ability in HUVECs
compared to sorafenib-treated cells (Figure 2D).
Although angiogenesis is a complex process
involving several types of cells, tube formation in
endothelial cells is one of the key steps. HUVECs were
grown on Matrigel and cultured in different concentrations
of YLL545 and sorafenib, and their ability to form
capillary tubes was examined. As shown in Figure 2E,
treatment with YLL545 dose-dependently inhibited
tube formation in HUVECs. HUVECs grown in 2.5 μM
YLL545 formed approximately 67% fewer capillary tubes
than those grown in vehicle control; 2.5 μM sorafenib
-inhibited tube formation to a lesser degree. Collectively,
these results indicate that YLL545 had antiangiogenic
effects on HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and
tube formation, and that these effects were either similar
to or stronger than those of sorafenib.

To determine whether YLL545 inhibited VEGFR2
and downstream signaling, we screened essential kinases
involved in the VEGFR2 signaling pathway. As shown in
Figure 3A, treatment with 2.5 μM YLL545 suppressed
VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2, mTOR,
STAT3, and ERK1/2. Given that VEGFR2 might be
stabilized by its physical engagement with YLL545,
we next examined their interaction in intact HUVECs.
The results of a cellular thermal shift assay showed that
YLL545 efficiently stabilized VEGFR2 (Figure 3B),
demonstrating that YLL545 exerts its antiangiogenic
effects by directly targeting VEGFR2 and antagonizing
VEGFR2-mediated signaling cascades. Furthermore, we
used molecular docking to analyze the binding mode of
YLL545 with the inactive conformation of VEGFR2. As
shown in Figure 3C, YLL545 formed a hydrogen bond
with Cys919 in the VEGFR2 linker region. The urea

with 5 μM YLL545 or vehicle for 24 h. The expression of ITGAV, ENG, THBS1, FN1, and TEK expression were examined by quantitative
PCR. Expression levels were normalized to GAPDH expression. ***P < 0.001 vs respective control in Student’s t-test.

moiety of YLL545 formed very tight hydrogen-bonding
interactions with Glu885 and Asp1046 in the DFG loop.
There were also some pi-pi interactions between YLL545
and Phe1407 and hydrophobic interactions with the Ile898,
Val899, Ile892, and Val899 residues in the allosteric
pocket. These results indicate that YLL545 has a similar
binding mode to that of sorafenib [21], demonstrating the
effectiveness of our ring closure design strategy.
We then examined differences in mRNA levels
of selected angiogenesis signaling molecules using the
RT2 Profiler PCR Array by comparing YLL545-treated
HUVECs with vehicle-treated control. Interestingly,
YLL545 altered the expression of several VEGFR2independent regulators (more than ± 10-fold), including
ITGAV, ENG, THBS1, FN1, and TEK were observed
(Table 1). These results were confirmed by quantitative
PCR, as shown in Figure 3D, and indicate that YLL545
may regulate endothelial angiogenesis via both VEGFR2dependent and -independent pathways.

of new blood vessels in Matrigel plugs to a lesser degree.
These data reveal that YLL545 blocks new blood vessel
formation in vivo.

YLL545 inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro
Because VEGF/VEGFR2 are also highly expressed
in triple-negative breast cancer cells [22, 23], we explored
the potential role of YLL545 in the regulation of tumor
growth. To do this, we measured cell viability in MDAMB-231 cells treated with different concentrations of
YLL545 using CCK-8 assays. As shown in Figure 5A,
YLL545 inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 13.34 μM
(Figure S2). Colony formation assays confirmed that
2.5 μM YLL545 decreased colony formation in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 5B). Inhibition of cell proliferation
is a possible approach for cancer treatment; we therefore
performed an EdU incorporation assay to investigate the
antiproliferative effect of YLL545. As shown in Figure 5C,
2.5 μM YLL545 decreased the percentage of proliferating
MDA-MB-231 cells by 70%. Annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining was used to examine YLL545-induced cell
apoptosis. Treatment with 5 μM YLL545 markedly
increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D).
These observations collectively suggest YLL545 strongly
inhibits tumorigenesis in vitro.

YLL545 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo
To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of YLL545 in
vivo, we used a Fli-1 promoter enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) transgenic zebrafish model. Twelve hours
post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were incubated
overnight with different concentrations of YLL545 or
sorafenib. As shown in Figure 4A, 0.625 to 1.25 μM
YLL545 reduced the formation of dorsal longitudinal
anastomotic vessels (DLAVs) and intersegmental vessels
(ISVs) compared to sorafenib treatment; the formation of
major cranial vessels was not inhibited. Treatment with
2.5 μM YLL545 resulted in a complete loss of DLAVs and
ISVs. YLL545 similarly inhibited caudal vessel formation
(Figure 4B), indicating that YLL545 effectively inhibits
angiogenesis in vivo in zebrafish.
Next, we conducted Matrigel plug assays in a mouse
model of angiogenesis. As shown in Figure 4C, new blood
vessels in Matrigel plugs were inhibited in mice treated
with 80 mg/kg YLL545 compared to the vehicle-treated
group. Immunofluorescent staining of an anti-CD31
antibody (Ab) further revealed that YLL545 treatment
reduced the number of endothelial cells embedded in the
plug sections by 95%. Sorafenib inhibited the formation

YLL545 exerts antitumor activities in vivo
Next, to better assess the effect of YLL545 on
tumor growth in vivo, a nude mouse xenograft model
was established using MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in
Figure 6A and 6B, treatment with 50 mg/kg/d YLL545
resulted in ~50% inhibition of tumor growth compared
to vehicle-treated mice. Immunohistochemical staining
for anti-CD31 Ab confirmed that tumor microvessel
density (MVD) decreased in YLL545-treated mice
(Figure 6C). Immunohistochemical staining revealed
that Ki67, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-STAT3 levels
were also reduced in YLL545-treated tumors, indicating
decreased cell proliferation and VEGFR2 activity
(Figure 6D). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of
YLL545 on apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors

using TUNEL staining. As shown in Figure 6E, 50 mg/
kg/d YLL545 increased the number of apoptotic cells
in tumor tissues, which was consistent with the results
from MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. No adverse effects
in other gross measures such as skin ulcerations or toxic
death, were observed in the YLL545-treated group. Toxic
pathological changes in the heart, liver, spleen, lung and
kidney were not detected by microscopic examination
(Figure 6F). These data indicate that YLL545 both inhibits
angiogenesis and induces apoptosis in breast cancer
xenografts in vivo, and this effect is not attributable to
systemic toxicity.

antagonizing downstream signaling cascades. In addition
to blocking VEGFR2, YLL545 altered the expression of
other molecules involved in tumor angiogenesis, including
ITGAV [30], ENG [31, 32], THBS1 [33, 34], FN1 [35-37],
and TEK [38, 39]. However, these genes are not targets of
VEGF/VEGFR2 (Figure S3), indicating that a VEGFR2independent mechanism might also contribute to the
antiangiogenic effects of YLL545.
Because endothelial cell models of migration,
invasion, and tube formation lack the biological
complexity of vessel systems in vertebrate animals [40],
we examined the antiangiogenic effect of YLL545 in vivo
using zebrafish embryonic angiogenesis and Matrigel plug
assay modles. Treatment with 0.625 to 1.25 μM YLL545
inhibited angiogenic formation of DLAVs and ISVs
in zebrafish, which corresponds to capillary sprouting
in mammals [41]. Importantly, YLL545 had higher or
comparable antiangiogenic potency, but strikingly lower
cytotoxicity, than sorafenib in zebrafish embryos (Figure
S4). Furthermore, subcutaneous transplantation of
Matrigel plugs revealed that YLL545 inhibited angiogenic
response in mice, confirming that YLL545 blocks the
formation of new blood vessels in vivo.
In addition to inhibiting endothelial angiogenesis,
YLL545 also directly inhibited triple-negative breast
cancer cell proliferation and survival. YLL545 inhibited
MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by increasing G1/S
cell cycle arrest, as shown in the EdU-incorporation
assay. Importantly, YLL545 administration (50 mg/kg/d)
inhibited tumor growth by 50% in our BALB/c nude
mouse xenograft model. Additionally, treating tumor
cells with YLL545 increased the number of apoptotic
cells, as visualized by TUNEL staining. As suggested by
a previous report [42], it is plausible that YLL545 inhibits
angiogenesis in xenograft tumors, which deprives tumor
cells of oxygen and nutrients and results in tumor cell
apoptosis. Because of these antitumor effects and because
it did not induce toxic pathological changes in mice,
YLL545 might be a promising novel anticancer candidate
drug with limited side effects.
In summary, our studies showed that the novel and
well-tolerated small molecule YLL545 inhibited VEGFR2
angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis in triple-negative breast
cancer. YLL545 inhibited breast tumor growth and
angiogenesis by blocking VEGFR2-mediated downstream
signaling pathways, such as STAT3 and ERK1/2. Our
research suggests that YLL545 and its derivatives may
be potential drug candidates for diseases associated with
pathological angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION
Antiangiogenic therapy is an effective strategy
for the treatment of solid tumors [5, 24], and targeting
VEGFR2 with small molecule inhibitors of receptor
tyrosine kinase has been particularly effective in human
cancer treatment [14-16]. In the present study, we
investigated a potent new small molecule VEGFR2
inhibitor, YLL545. YLL545 inhibited VEGF-induced
VEGFR2 phosphorylation and activation of downstream
signaling pathways, such as phospho-STAT3 and phosphoERK1/2. Functional assays revealed that, YLL545
inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube
formation in HUVECs in vitro; the potency of YLL545
was either comparable to or higher than sorafenib in these
tests. Notably, YLL545 also strongly inhibited tumor
growth and angiogenesis in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative
breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. YLL545 might
therefore be a promising anticancer drug candidate.
VEGFR2 signaling is essential for vascular
endothelial cell function [9]. Tyr1175 is the major
autophosphorylation site within VEGFR2, and its
phosphorylation initiates various downstream signaling
events. For example, VEGFR2 with phosphorylated Tyr1175
activates the MAPK/ERK cascade and endothelial cell
proliferation [25]. Meanwhile, VEGF-induced activation
of STAT3 also plays a critical role in angiogenesis,
and this signaling pathway is a potential target for
antiangiogenic tumor therapy in endothelial cells [26-28].
Recent studies show that STAT3 directly activates VEGF
and HIF-1α transcription under hypoxic conditions, which
results in the initiation of endothelial cell migration and
angiogenesis [29]. Angiogenesis is a complex process with
multiple steps [7, 8]. All known angiogenesis inhibitors
block one or more steps of these steps by targeting
endothelial cells [26]. Here, by directly blocking VEGFR2
phosphorylation, YLL545 suppressed STAT3 and ERK1/2
signaling and ultimately inhibited various processes
in endothelial cells in vitro, including proliferation,
migration, invasion, and tube formation. Moreover,
a cellular thermal shift assay confirmed that YLL545
binds to VEGFR2, demonstrating that YLL545 exerts its
antiangiogenic function by directly targeting VEGFR2 and

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Briefly, the filter was pre-coated with 50 μL Matrigel
(BD Biosciences), which was allowed to solidify at 37°C
for 1 h. Cells (4.0×104 cells/well for HUVECs, 2.0×104
cells/well for MDA-MB-231) were then placed in the
top chambers and treated with different concentrations
of YLL545 or sorafenib. Cells were then allowed to
migrate for 16 h. Non-migrated cells were scraped with
a cotton swab, and migrated cells were fixed with 20%
methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The cells
were counted and photographed under a light microscope
(Olympus). Cell migration is expressed as a percentage of
the migration observed in vehicle-treated cells.

Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were
maintained in L15 (Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Biological Industries), penicillin,
and streptomycin (Invitrogen). HUVECs were isolated
from human umbilical cord, which was provided by
Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China. HUVECs
were maintained in endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2)
supplemented with a SingleQuots Kit containing VEGF
and other growth factors (LONZA). HUVECs at passages
3 to 8 were used for all studies.

Tube formation assay
A pre-chilled 48-well plate was coated with 160 μL
Matrigel (BD Biosciences), which was allowed to solidify
at 37°C for 30 min. Cells (4×104 cells/well) were seeded
on the Matrigel and cultured in the presence of different
concentrations of YLL545 or sorafenib. After incubation
at 37°C for 6 h, 5 randomly chosen fields were counted
and photographed under a light microscope (Olympus).

Cell viability assay
Cells growing in 96-well plates were cultured in the
presence of different concentrations of YLL545. At the
indicated time points, cell viability was assessed using the
CCK-8 assay according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(Dojindo). Six parallel replicates were measured for each
sample.

Colony formation assay
Cells (6×102 cells/well) were seeded in sixwell plates and cultured in the presence of different
concentrations of YLL545 for 7 days. The cells were fixed
with 20% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and
photographed under a light microscope (Olympus).

5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) proliferation
assay
Cells growing in 24-well plates were cultured in the
presence of different concentrations of YLL545 for 72 h,
and then assayed with a Cell-Light™ EdU Apollo®488
In Vitro Imaging Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (RiboBio). Images were taken and analyzed
using a Confocal FV1000 microscope (Olympus).
Percentages of EdU-positive cells were calculated as
follows: (EdU-positive cells/Hoechst stained cells) ×
100%. At least 200 cells were counted per well.

Immunoblotting assay
Preparation of total cell extracts and immunoblotting
with appropriate antibodies was performed as previously
described [43]. The following antibodies (Abs) were
used: goat monoclonal Ab against VEGFR2 (# 2479,
Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000, rabbit
monoclonal Ab against phospho-VEGFR2 (# 2478, Cell
Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000, rabbit
monoclonal Ab against STAT3 (# 14801, Cell Signaling
Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal
Ab against phospho-STAT3 (# 4093, Cell Signaling
Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal Ab
against ERK1/2 (# 4695, Cell Signaling Technology) at a
dilution of 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal Ab against phosphoERK1/2 (# 14474, Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution
of 1:1000, mouse monoclonal Ab against mTOR (# 4517,
Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000, and
rabbit monoclonal Ab against phospho-mTOR (# 5536,
Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000.

Wound healing assay
Cells were allowed to grow to full confluence in
6-well plates and then wounded by scratching with pipette
tips, followed by treatment with different concentrations
of YLL545 or sorafenib for 24 h. The migrated distance
was quantified by manual counting and photographed
under a light microscope (Olympus). Migrated distance
is expressed as a percentage of the distance observed in
vehicle-treated cells.

Transwell invasion assay
Transwell in vitro invasion 24-well chambers
(Corning) were used per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Target engagement assay

Matrigel plug assay

The cellular thermal shift assay was performed as
previously described [44, 45], with some modifications.
Briefly, cells were incubated with 50 μM YLL545 for 3
h, detached with trypsin and collected in TBS containing
a complete protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were
then divided into 4 aliquots and heated individually at
40°C, 43°C, 46°C, and 49°C for 3 min. Subsequently,
the cell suspensions were freeze-thawed three times
using liquid nitrogen. Soluble proteins were separated
from the precipitated fraction by centrifugation at 20,000
g for 20 min. The proteins were then detected with an
immunoblotting assay using the VEGFR2 Ab at a dilution
of 1:1000.

All experimental procedures involving animals were
performed according to institutional ethical guidelines
for animal experiments and approved by the Ethics
Committee for Animal Use at the Medical College of
Nankai University. BALB/c mice (mean body weight: 22.8
± 0.5 g; n = 4) were given subcutaneous injections of 1000
μL of a 3:1 mixture of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) and YLL545 (80 mg/kg) or sorafenib (80
mg/kg). After 10 days, plugs were harvested, imaged, and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of optimum
cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek) before
sectioning. Frozen Matrigel sections were fixed in cold
methanol and immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal Ab
against CD31 (ab28364, Abcam).

RT2 profiler PCR array

Tumor xenograft experiments

Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs treated
with 5 μM YLL545 or vehicle control for 24 h. An RT2
Profiler custom PCR array was used to simultaneously
examine the mRNA levels of 84 genes closely associated
with angiogenesis and 5 housekeeping genes in 96-well
plates following the manufacturer’s protocol (PAHS-049Z,
QIAGEN). Briefly, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized
from 1 μg of total RNA using the TaqMan RT reagent
kit (QIAGEN). Arrays were performed independently
at least 3 times; values were obtained for the threshold
cycle (ΔCt) for each gene and normalized using the
average of 5 housekeeping genes on the same array
(ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, and RPLP0). Changes
in expression (ΔΔCt) between YLL545-and vehicletreated cells were determined using the following formula:
ΔΔCt = ΔCt(YLL545) - ΔCt(Vehicle). Fold-change was
determined as follows: fold-change = 2(-ΔΔCt). Only genes
with a 10-fold or greater change in expression were
examined. Negative controls ensured the absence of DNA
contamination and defined thresholds for determining
absence versus presence of expression.

MDA-MB-231 cells were collected, suspended in
100 μL of PBS at a concentration of 2.5×107 cells/mL,
and injected into the fat pad of female BALB/c nude
mice. When tumors reached a volume of approximately
100 mm3, mice were randomized into 2 groups (5 mice
per group) and YLL545 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle was
administered orally once per day. Tumor volumes (V) were
calculated by measuring the length (L) and width (W) of
the tumor with calipers and using the following formula:
V = (L × W2) × 0.5. Tumor tissues were also processed and
sectioned for histological evaluation.

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffinembedded sections was performed using the Envision Kit
(Dako) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Sections
were boiled in retrieval solutions to expose antigens. We
applied 1:100 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal Ab against
CD31 (ab28364, Abcam), rabbit monoclonal Ab against
Ki-67 (# 9027, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit
monoclonal Ab against phospho-STAT3 (# 9145P, Cell
Signaling Technology), rabbit monoclonal Ab against
phospho-ERK1/2 (# 4370P, Cell Signaling Technology),
and control primary Abs to the sections. Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted. Immunostaining was independently evaluated
by 2 pathologists. Apoptotic cells in the tumor tissue were
detected by staining using an apoptotic cell detection kit
(Merck Millipore).

Drug studies in zebrafish
The transgenic zebrafish embryos (Fli-1: EGFP)
used in the experiments were grown and maintained as
described previously [46]. 12-hpf zebrafish embryos
were treated with different concentrations of YLL545
or sorafenib. At 36 hpf, embryos were anesthetized with
0.01% tricaine, and fluorescent images were captured
using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). Blood vessel
formation was quantiﬁed by calculating the length
of intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and represented as
percentage of vehicle control.

Statistical analysis
SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS) was used for statistical
analysis. The data from all experiments were presented

as the means ± SD and represent three independent
experiments. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA)
were used to compare means between treatment groups,
and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference)
tests were used to evaluate the statistically significant
differences between groups. Where appropriate, Student’s
t-test for unpaired observations was applied. A p-value <
0.05 was considered significant.
