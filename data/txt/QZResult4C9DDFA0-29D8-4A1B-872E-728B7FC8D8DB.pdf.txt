BACKGROUND: The use of platinum-based chemoradiation for esophageal cancer is routine, but it is unclear which
class of cytotoxic are optimum. It was hypothesized that chemoradiotherapy with fluoropyrimidine, taxane, and
camptothecin would have preserved or improved efficacy with no compromise in safety. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed, resectable esophageal carcinoma were eligible. In addition to other tests, a baseline endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was obtained. Patients were medically fit and had near–normal organ functions.
Patients received docetaxel and irinotecan, plus 5–fluorouracil as induction therapy and then the same cytotoxics
with 50.4 grays of radiotherapy followed by an attempted surgery. Pathologic complete response (pathCR) at a rate
of 20% was the primary endpoint. The pathCR and R0 resection were correlated with overall survival (OS). Safety
was documented. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled. Seven were women, and the median age was 56 years.
Fifty-three (96%) patients had EUST3, and 41 (75%) had EUSN1 disease. Forty-three (78%) patients underwent surgery, 20% achieved a pathCR, and 76.4% underwent an R0 resection. The median survival (n ¼ 55 patients) was 43.3
months (range, 19-75 months). Baseline clinical parameters were not found to be predictive of OS; however, patients
with a pathCR (P ¼ .005) and who underwent R0 resection (P  .0001) had an improved OS. There was 1 treatmentrelated postsurgical death reported. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) was observed in 62% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study
documented that this 3-drug, noncisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy was feasible, safe, and active but not better
than the published cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. A fluoropyrimidine and another cytotoxic (from any class)
may be adequate to establish a baseline chemoradiotherapy regimen to combine biologics. Cancer 2010;116:1656–63.

Approximately 600,000 new cases of esophagus cancer are diagnosed each year around the world, including
approximately 16,400 new cases in the United States.1,2 Esophageal cancer is diagnosed in its late stages and even when
localized, the 5-year survival rate is <20% and has not changed in several decades.1-4 In the West, the most common histology is adenocarcinoma, afflicting mainly white men but the incidence is rising just as rapidly in women.3-5
For patients with localized esophageal carcinoma (frequently clinical stages II and III), preoperative chemoradiation
is offered at most centers6,7 despite equivocal results from randomized trials.8-12 Definitive chemoradiotherapy (without
surgery) leads to a 5-year cure rate of approximately 15%, but also results in a local failure rate of 60%.13 It has been long
recognized that, after preoperative chemoradiation, the degree of pathologic response is diverse (and not predictable)

based on the inherent molecular heterogeneity that dictates tumor chemoradiation sensitivity. The degree of
pathologic response (in particular pathologic complete
response [pathCR]) is a prognosticator of long-term survival.14-17
Although cisplatin and 5–fluorouracil have been
most frequently incorporated with chemoradiotherapy for
esophageal cancer, the value and morbidity imparted by
some of these agents has been a subject of investigation.18
Most frequently, 2 agents from the 4 classes of cytotoxics
(flouropyrimidines, platinols, camptothecins, and taxanes) are combined with radiotherapy. Many such combinations are in common use and are based mainly on pilot
studies or institutional preferences.19 However, investigators have strived to incorporate taxanes and camptothecins with chemoradiation with the hopes that new
chemoradiation combinations would result in higher rates
of pathCR.20-24 Recent retrospective analyses have been
disappointing in terms of increasing the rate of pathCR or
survival.15,25-27
The mediation of chemotherapy and radiation resistance is a complex phenomenon. Our understanding is
limited, and we cannot exploit it to optimize therapy.28 It
may be that, until these mechanisms are clarified, the rate
of pathCR, which is generally approximately 25%,15 is
not likely to increase. At the time of the conception of the
current study, there was considerable interest in then-new
classes of agents (taxanes and camptothecins); thus, we
hypothesized that pathCR may be increased by incorporating 2 new cytotoxics with 5–fluorouracil (a 3-drug
combination might be better than 2-drug combinations).
We used a previously described 3-step strategy29-32 to
study this 3-drug combination. The other assumption was
that a platinum compound is not essential and a newer
nonplatinum combination can at least retain the anticipated efficacy without compromising safety.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Evaluation
Patients with localized, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic
esophagus were eligible and evaluated by computed tomography (chest and abdomen), upper gastrointestinal
barium radiographs, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), electrocardiogram, serum chemistry, electrolytes, complete blood
count, and a baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level.
Patients with baseline T2 to T3 disease with any lymph

node classification (N), patients with M1a cancer, and
patients with T1N1 cancer were considered eligible. N
classification took EUS features into account and, when
feasible, an EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration result.
Positron emission tomography was performed when feasible. Before registration, a multidisciplinary evaluation was
performed in every patient to ensure that the tumor was
technically resectable and the patient was medically fit for
surgery. The protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board. All patients provided written informed
consent.
Patients with T4 or T1N0 disease were excluded.
Patients with any evidence of metastatic disease were ineligible, as were patients with uncontrolled comorbid
conditions.
Treatment
The primary endpoint was to obtain a pathCR rate of at
least 20%. Secondary objectives were to assess the feasibility (safety) of a nonplatinum–containing chemotherapy
by the 3-step approach using 3 agents before and during
radiotherapy. After the completion of protocol treatment,
if a patient underwent an R0 resection, no further therapy
was planned. Patients with an R1, R2 resection or those
who had M1 disease were offered palliative care.
Induction chemotherapy

All patients had a central venous line placed.
Patients received docetaxel as an intravenous bolus (at a
dose of 33 mg/m2) in 1 hour, irinotecan (at a dose of 55
mg/m2) as an intravenous bolus in 1 and 1.5 hours, and a
5-fluorouracil (at a dose of 2 g/m2) infusion over 24 hours
weekly for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off. One cycle was
6 weeks long and was comprised of 2 doses of the regimen
every 21 days. Irinotecan was administered first followed
by docetaxel and then 5-fluorouracil infusion was initiated. Standard premedications were used. If there was no
disease progression noted after the first cycle, patients
received a second cycle of the induction chemotherapy. A
dose escalation and de-escalation schema was specified
based on the grade and duration of toxic effects. Toxicity
was graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0) (available at:
www.nci.gov/ accessed on November 15, 2009).
Preoperative chemoradiotherapy

Patients received up to 50.4 grays of radiotherapy in
28 fractions. Concurrently, patients received docetaxel (at
a dose of 20 mg/m2) administered intravenously weekly,

1657

irinotecan (at a dose of 30 mg/m2) administered intravenously weekly, and 5-fluorouracil (at a dose of 300 mg/
m2/24 hours) administered as a continuous infusion
Monday through Friday of each radiotherapy week.
Standard premedications were used.

Surgery

Five to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, a complete restaging was performed and surgery
was attempted. The type of surgery was determined by the
operating thoracic surgeon. Each resected specimen was
examined in an elaborate manner,14,33 and was reverified
by 1 pathologist (T.T.W.) who had no knowledge of
patient outcome. The pathologic response was assigned to
1 of 2 categories: pathCR or < pathCR.
Patient Follow-Up
Each patient was assessed at 3 months, 6 months, 9
months, and 12 months; every 6 months for 2 additional
years; and then every year or until death. The development of locoregional and/or metastatic disease recurrence
was assessed.

Statistical Analysis
One of the desired goals was to achieve 20% rate of
pathCR from the noncisplatin-based combination. Based
on the 2-stage design of Dixon and Simon,34 a maximum
total of 41 patients who had completed surgery were
required. Thus, P ¼ true rate of pathCR. The null hypothesis was H0: P 5%. If this hypothesis was true
(herein, we were likely to observe only 1 pathCR among
the first 21 patients), then the study would have been terminated. We had an alternate hypothesis in which H1: P
would be 20%, in which case the probability of rejecting
the strategy would have been <10% (here we were likely
to observe 2 pathCRs in the first 21 patients and, therefore, an additional 20 patients will have been accrued).
Assuming approximately 12% of patients would not
undergo surgery for various reasons (disease progression,
toxicity, patient refusal), approximately 52 to 55 patients
were needed.
Primary analyses were performed for overall survival
(OS). OS was defined as the time from study registration
to death. When the date of death was not available, then
the last follow-up date was used. Data from patients who
had not died were censored. Secondary analyses included
impact on OS from pathCR, R0 resection, type and grade
of tumor histology, and patient gender. The SAS software

1658

package (version 6.12) was used for computations (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The study was completed between November 2001 and
April 2004. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.
There were 7 women enrolled, and 6 patients had squamous cell carcinoma. The primary location of the tumor
was predominantly in the lower esophagus, including the
gastroesophageal junction (95%). On baseline EUS, 96%
of patients had a T3 tumor and 74% had N1 disease. The
majority of patients had a poorly differentiated tumor.
Treatment Characteristics
Although there was a plan to increase the doses if feasible,
the starting doses of all 3 agents was found to be optimum
and no dose escalation or de-escalation was attempted. All
55 patients receive the first course of induction chemotherapy. Forty-nine (89%) patients received the second
course of induction chemotherapy. Six patients did not
receive the second course of induction therapy because 1
patient with squamous cell carcinoma had to undergo a

gastrectomy for gastric perforation of unclear etiology,
1 patient died of unrelated causes, 1 patient developed
liver metastases, and 3 patient developed local disease progression. One patient manifested metastases after the second course of induction therapy; therefore, 51 (93%)
patients proceeded to chemoradiotherapy. After the completion of chemoradiotherapy, 43 (78%) patients proceeded to surgery (1 patient refused surgery, 1 patient had
clinical deterioration and became ineligible for surgery, 5
patients developed metastases, and 1 patient developed a
second malignancy).
Forty-six patients demonstrated some degree of
objective improvement after induction chemotherapy.
Preoperative staging performed 5 to 6 weeks after the
completion of chemoradiotherapy demonstrated objective improvement in 20 patients. Of 49 patients who had
an endoscopic evaluation and biopsy after the completion
of chemoradiotherapy, 42 had no evidence of disease
found on the biopsy. Seven patients underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy, and the remaining 36 patients underwent transthoracic surgery.

Survival
The median follow-up time was 48 months. The median
survival of the entire group (n ¼ 55) was 43.36 months
(95% confidence intervals [95% CI],25.49-68.10
months). There was no difference in the OS noted
between patients with squamous cell carcinoma and those
with adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .21). Forty-four patients with
poorly differentiated histology had a median survival of
27.46 months (95% CI, 3.66-51.26 months) compared
with a median survival that had not been reached at the
time of last follow–up for patients with moderately differentiated histology, but the difference was not statistically
significant (P ¼ .137). The median survival of women
(21.16 months) was shorter than that of men (46.06
months), but this difference was not found to be statistically significant (P ¼ .29). Baseline stage (P ¼ .99) and
location of the primary tumor (P ¼ .35) appeared to have
no impact on OS.
Patients who achieved an R0 resection (n ¼ 42) had
a median survival of 54.13 months compared with those
in whom <R0 resection (n ¼ 13) was achieved (P 
.0001) (Fig. 1). Patients who achieved a pathCR (n ¼ 11)
were found to survive longer and, at the time of last follow–up, their median survival had not been reached compared with those patients who achieved <pathCR (n ¼
44; median survival, 38.20 months [P ¼ .005]) (Fig. 2).
The median survival of patients with N0 disease had not
been reached at the time of last follow–up compared with
patients with N1 disease, whose median survival was
27.46 months; however, this difference was not found to
be statistically significant (P ¼ .19). Patients in whom

Therapy-Related Toxicities and Complications

DISCUSSION
What are some of the most pertinent issues for research
development for localized esophageal cancer? Which cytotoxics are most efficaciously combined with radiotherapy?
Which efficacious combination provides enough safety
that a biologic can be combined with it for biochemoradiotherapy? Does induction chemotherapy provide any
advantage or disadvantage? Which patients, although considered eligible for trimodality therapy at baseline, would
really benefit from trimodality therapy? The answers are
not easy to come by, but the results of the current study
provide unique insights into some of these questions. A
previous effort35 suggests that fluoropyrimidines contribute to the efficacy and should be included with chemoradiotherapy.36 Whether the second agent should be
combined remains unclear but cisplatin plus fluoropyrimidine became the de facto chemoradiotherapy standard.13 To the best of our knowledge, there are not many
recent examples of chemoradiation studies that are cisplatin-based. Fournel et al37 provided recent data in which
thoracic chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin resulted in a
considerable rate of hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicity similar to what we report in the current trial. The
results of the current study indicate that non–cisplatin–
containing chemoradiotherapy produces efficacy and
safety similar to what one would anticipate from a more

Preoperative therapy

Induction chemotherapy and chemoradiationinduced toxicities are shown in Table 2. Thirty (54.5%)
patients had at least 1 grade 3 or 4 toxicity during induction chemotherapy, and 34 (62%) patients developed at
least 1 grade 3 or 4 toxicity during chemoradiotherapy.
Fatigue and dehydration were commonly observed.
Dehydration was particularly observed in the last 2 weeks
of chemoradiotherapy. Only 2 patients experienced grade
4 hematologic toxicity. No grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was observed. There was no grade 5 toxicity noted as a
result of preoperative therapy. During induction chemotherapy, treatment delay occurred on 6 occasions, dose
reductions were performed on 13 occasions, and the
scheduled chemotherapy was canceled due to myelosuppression on 11 occasions. During chemoradiotherapy,
delay occurred on only 1 occasion, dose reduction was
required on 2 occasions, and the scheduled chemotherapy
was not delivered due to myelosuppression on 7
occasions.
Surgery-related morbidity and mortality

One patient had an acute myocardial infarction on
Day 10 of surgery and died. Twenty patients had some
form of pulmonary morbidity postoperatively, ranging

typical trimodality therapy administered in this setting.
The current study also demonstrates that 3 drugs combined with radiotherapy do not produce exhilarating efficacy results and safety is not jeopardized (realizing that
this is a single-center trial and such trials often underestimate toxicity which increase when adopted in a multicenter setting). The current study also demonstrates that
(then) newer classes of cytotoxics (taxanes and camptothecins) do not provide a safety advantage over platinum
compounds. The question of the role of induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy remains unanswered
and an ongoing randomized trial at our institution might
shed some light on this subject (available at: www.clinicaltrials.gov/ accessed November 2009; NCT00525915).
We do not routinely recommend the use of induction
chemotherapy. Furthermore, the use of chemoradiotherapy in the preoperative setting is a growing trend and it is
often being considered outside of the United States.36,3840
This trend is not likely to subside. Our current study, a
previous randomized phase 2 trial,18 and recent retrospective reviews15,25-27 suggest that the second cytotoxic could
be a platinum compound, taxane, or camptothecin. The
current thrust is to identify a cytotoxic combination regimen that is safe and provides a platform in which to
include a biologic (biochemoradiotherapy). The challenge
is to be sure that the established 2-drug regimen preserves
the expected activity (producing a pathCR rate of 2025%, a median survival of approximately 22 months,
and a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%). The
current phase 2 study meets these criteria, but it also establishes that 3 cytotoxic drugs are not necessary. Interest in
the addition of a biologic agent is increasing,41 and some
studies have been reported to date.40 Based on a recent
study,18 our baseline regimen is a combination of a fluoropyrimidine and taxane and it has allowed for the incorporation of a biologic agent in an ongoing trial (available
at: www.clinicaltrials.gov/ accessed November 2009;
NCT00561197).
Finally, with regard to optimizing therapy based on
clinical biology, even with continued refinement in staging procedures, the aggressive clinical behavior of some
esophageal cancers (even those of clinical stages II or III)
cannot be predicted. We used uniform entry criteria for
eligibility and nevertheless 6 patients developed metastases before it was time for an attempted surgery. In the current trial, the use of induction therapy led to a delay in
surgery by several weeks (and by providing this window of
time), and this delay resulted in the development of metastases in 6 (11%) patients. This observation suggests

Cancer

April 1, 2010

that we need tools to identify such patients with aggressive
clinical biology. The use of induction chemotherapy to
prolong the time to surgery is not an acceptable strategy
for screening out patients who have esophageal cancer
with an aggressive biology, but it is a thought–provoking
issue. Clearly, the last thing would be to hurriedly subject
a patient to surgery only to learn that he/she has widespread metastases by the time surgical recovery is complete. It may be that imaging techniques would prove
useful in defining the clinical biology.25,42-48 The other
possibility is to study biomarkers that discriminate tumors
with good biology from those with poor biology.49,50 The
imaging and biomarkers strategies are appealing but need
considerably more investigation before they can be used
in the clinic. Until that time, we are left with the empiric
approaches.
The current study may mark an end to the era of
cytotoxics being combined with radiotherapy. It may be
that we have reached a plateau with regard to what we can
accomplish with this strategy and that further advances
can only come through uncovering the molecular biology
of cancer and genetics of patients for proper patient
selection.
In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that our 3-drug, non–cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is feasible, safe, and active but may not be better
than the published cisplatin-based combinations. A fluoropyrimidine and another cytotoxic (from any class) may
be adequate to establish a baseline chemoradiotherapy
regimen with which to combine with biologics.
