Abstract
We have previously shown that spores of the nonpathogenic
clostridial strain C. sporogenes genetically engineered to
express the E. coli–derived cytosine deaminase gene are
effective in converting systemically injected nontoxic 5fluorocytosine into the toxic anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil,
thereby producing tumor-specific antitumor activity. To
improve the expression of E. coli–derived genes with this
system, we first replaced the original fdP promoter in the
vector with one of two powerful endogenous clostridial
promoters: that of the thiolase gene (thlP) and that for the
clostridial transcription factor abrB310 (abrBP). These substitutions improved protein expression levels of the prodrugactivating genes by 2- to 3-fold in comparison with fdP-driven
expression. However, despite these strong promoters, we
found much higher expression of the nitroreductase (NTR)
protein in the E. coli host compared with the clostridial host,
which we hypothesized could be the result of different codon
use between the two organisms. To test this, we constructed
new expression vectors with an artificially synthesized NTR
gene using optimized clostridial codons (sNTR). Results from
both enzymatic assays and Western blots of cell extracts from
clostridial transformants harboring plasmid constructs of
thlP-sNTR and abrBP-sNTR showed that the expression and
activity of the NTR gene product was increased by f20-fold
compared with the original construct. In vivo studies with i.v.
administered sNTR-expressing C. sporogenes spores in SiHa
tumor–bearing mice showed significantly improved antitumor
efficacy when combined with either 5-aziridinyl-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB1954) or the novel dinitrobenzamide mustard
prodrug, PR-104. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7995–8003]

Introduction
The presence of necrotic areas is a common feature of human
solid tumors (1). Because necrotic regions do not usually occur in
normal tissues and are generally anaerobic, we have proposed that
they could be used to target anticancer drugs selectively to tumors
using genetically engineered anaerobic bacteria of the genus
Clostridium (2, 3). This genus comprises a large and heterogeneous

group of Gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that become
vegetative and grow only in the absence (or at low levels) of
oxygen and can be genetically engineered to produce a prodrugactivating enzyme to specifically target anticancer drugs to tumors,
an approach we have termed Clostridium-directed enzyme prodrug
therapy (CDEPT; ref. 4).
Initially, efforts to use the tumor-targeting properties of
nonpathogenic strains of Clostridia focused on the fact that
following i.v. injection, spores of these strains localized and
germinated in the necrotic areas of experimental tumors and
produced extensive tumor lysis (5–10). These animal experiments
were followed by clinical studies with cancer patients, which
showed that spores of nonpathogenic strains of Clostridia could be
given safely, that the spores germinate in the necrotic regions of
tumors, and that lysis of the tumors can occur (11–13). However,
these clinical experiments did not improve patient outcome and
were discontinued.
More recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of
Clostridia, and impressive preclinical results have been obtained
with a detoxified strain of C. novyi in combination with
chemotherapy (1, 14), radiation therapy (15), and immunotherapy
(16). Preclinical toxicology has been done with this strain (17) and
a phase 1 trial is under way. Meanwhile, we and others have
proposed using genetically engineered Clostridia (2–4, 18, 19) or
Bifidobacterium longum (20, 21). In a related approach, attenuated
Salmonella genetically engineered to produce cytosine deaminase
have been used both in rodents (22) and in a phase 1 clinical trials
(23). However, the basis for tumor selective targeting by Salmonella
is unclear, and in patients it seems that tolerable doses of the
attenuated Salmonella fail to germinate in the tumors at
sufficiently high density.
In previous studies, we showed very high tumor colonization
levels with the clinically used Clostridium C. sporogenes and that we
could express the E. coli enzyme cytosine deaminase in this
organism to convert the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine to the
toxic anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, both in vitro and in vivo, and
produce significant antitumor activity with 5-fluorocytosine
combined with the recombinant clostridial spores (4). We also
showed that i.v. injection of spores of recombinant C. sporogenes
expressing the E. coli enzyme nitroreductase (NTR) into tumorbearing mice produced NTR protein solely in the tumors (3).
However, we also noted that the expression level of prodrugactivating enzymes from our vector in C. sporogenes was up to
50-fold lower than that of the same vector in E. coli, implying that
the antitumor activity of prodrug-activating enzymes from
C. sporogenes was considerably less than optimal.
Our goal in this study was to significantly improve the
antitumor activity of CDEPT. Because the expression level of a

prodrug-activating enzyme is critical for the efficacy of CDEPT,
our goal was to maximize the expression level of prodrugactivating enzymes in C. sporogenes. We did this in two ways:
(a) by replacing the currently used ferredoxin promoter from
C. perfringens with a stronger constitutively expressed, endogenous clostridial promoter, and (b) by replacing the native E. coli
gene coding NTR with an artificially synthesized gene using
Clostridia preferred codon usage. E. coli genes usually are very
poorly expressed in the clostridial host because of the large
differences in the codon usage and the lack of the corresponding
tRNAs in Clostridia (24, 25). Thus, to overcome the codon usage
bias for an E. coli gene expressed in a clostridial host, we
artificially synthesized the open reading frame of E. coli NTR,
maintaining the peptide sequence but optimizing the DNA
sequence according to known clostridial codon usage preference.
We tested the new CDEPT system by assessing its antitumor
activity using two clinically used dinitrobenzamide mustard
prodrugs, both substrates for E. coli NTR: 5-aziridinyl-2,4dinitrobenzamide (CB1954) and the novel hypoxia-activated drug
2-((2-bromoethyl)-2-{[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]carbonyl}-4,6-dinitroanilino)ethyl methanesulfonate phosphate ester (PR-104; ref. 26).
We show that the new construct is highly active in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids. The bacterial strains and plasmids
used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. E. coli strains were
grown aerobically at 37jC in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. For recombinant
strains, antibiotics were added to the medium after cooling down to below
55jC at the following final concentrations: 100 Ag/mL ampicillin, 10 Ag/mL
chloramphenicol, and 250 Ag/mL erythromycin when needed. Both wildtype and recombinant E. coli strains were maintained at 80jC in LB broth
supplemented with 15% glycerol.
Wild-type C. sporogenes strains were grown at 37jC in a BacII anaerobic
chamber (Shel Lab) in TPGY medium (trypticase peptone, 2%; peptone,
0.5%; glucose, 0.1%; yeast extract, 0.5%; cysteine HCl, 0.1%; agar was added
at 2% when needed). The medium was brought quickly into the anaerobic
chamber after autoclaving (which drives off the dissolved oxygen) and was
equilibrated with the chamber atmosphere for at least 24 h before use. For
recombinant clostridial strains, erythromycin at 10 Ag/mL was added to the
liquid medium after atmospheric equilibrium with anaerobic gas (90% N2,
5% H2, and 5% CO2) inside the hypoxic chamber. For maintenance of both
wild-type and recombinant clostridial strains, cells were first sporulated, as
described below, and the spores were aliquoted into PBS solution and
maintained at 80jC until use.
Sporulation procedure. Sporulation was induced as previously
described (3). Briefly, cultures were incubated at a suboptimal growth
temperature of 30jC for 5 to 7 d, after which maximum sporulation (usually
40–60%) was obtained. After extensive washing and purification, the spores
were aliquoted to cryogenic tubes and stored at 80jC until use.
Immediately before use, spores were subjected to a 72jC 15-min heat
shock, which simultaneously kills all vegetative rods and activates the
spores to the vegetative form. To assess the spore concentration and
plasmid retention, we plated a sample of this on both selective and
nonselective media.
Plasmid DNA isolation and manipulation. Plasmid isolation from
recombinant E. coli strains was done with Purelink Quick plasmid
minipreps kit (Invitrogen) or Wizard Plus Minipreps, DNA Purification
System (Promega) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
plasmid DNA was further purified first by using a standard phenolchloroform extraction procedure, then by differential precipitation with
polyethylene glycol 8000. All of the commercial enzymes used in this study
(i.e., restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, calf intestine alkaline
phosphatase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Klenow fragment of DNA
polymerase I) were purchased from New England Biolabs. The construction

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

of promoter strength screening vectors was based on a promoterless vector
of pJIR2717 (Supplementary Table S1). Five well-studied, endogenous
clostridial promoters including adcP (coding for acetoacetate decarboxylase; refs. 27, 28), glnAp (coding for glutamine synthetase; ref. 29),
ptbP (coding for phosphotransbutyrylase; ref. 28), thlP (coding for thiolase;
refs. 27, 28, 30, 31), abrBP (coding for transcription factor abrB310; ref. 32),
and a hypoxia-inducible promoter (vgbP) encoding Vitreoscilla hemoglobin
gene were cloned upstream of a catP gene and downstream of an V
fragment in pJIR2717. The ferrodoxin promoter ( fdP) used in our original
NTR-expressing vector, pNTR540FT, was also included for comparison.
These promoters were chosen as likely to be the strongest based on the
literature. The V fragment is a 2.0-kb DNA segment consisting of an
antibiotic resistance gene flanked by short inverted repeats carrying
transcription and translation termination signals that terminate RNA and
protein synthesis prematurely, thus allowing the definition and mapping of
both transcription and translation units (33). A 0.45-kb EcoRI-BamHI
fragment of pHT4, which contained the putative promoter region of ptbP,
was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and the Klenow fragment to form a
blunt-ended DNA fragment. This blunt-ended fragment was then inserted
into the single SmaI site of pJIR2717 to create the vector pJIR2717-ptbP.
Similarly, a 0.44-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pHT5 and a 0.32-kb EcoRIBamHI fragment of pHTA yielded the desired putative thlP and adcP
promoter regions, respectively. These fragments were also treated with T4
DNA polymerase and the Klenow fragment to form blunt-ended DNA. To
construct pJIR2717-thlP and pJIR2717-adcP, the blunt-ended DNA fragments were then inserted into the single SmaI site of pJIR2717. For
construction of pJIR2717-abrBP and pJIR2717-glnAP, appropriate primer
pairs (Supplementary Table S2) were used and corresponding putative
promoter regions were amplified from genomic DNA of C. acetobutylicum
ATCC824. Amplified fragments were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase
and Klenow fragment and inserted into the single SmaI site of pJIR2717 to
create vectors pJIR2717-abrBP and pJIR2717-glnAP. Similarly, fdP was
amplified from plasmid DNA of pNTR540FT and vgbP was amplified from
plasmid DNA of pUC8:16 with appropriate primer pairs (Supplementary
Table S2). Amplified fragments were then gel purified and blunt-ended with
T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow fragment and ligated with SmaI-digested
pJIR2717. The plasmids obtained were renamed pJIR2717-fdP and pJIR2717vgbP, respectively. All plasmids were first constructed in E. coli and then
electroporated into C. sporogenes using previously described methods
(4, 34). Positive clones were identified by resistance to chloramphenicol and
confirmed by restriction analysis. Promoter strength was assayed by
dilution plating as described below.
Strong promoters obtained from the above analysis were PCR amplified
with the appropriate template and primer pairs (Supplementary Table S2).
Amplified fragments containing the putative promoter regions were
restriction enzyme treated and ligated with a PCR-amplified NTR fragment
and inserted into the backbone plasmid of pMTL540FT. The thlP and abrBP
promoter fragments including their own ribosome-binding sites were first
PCR amplified from genomic DNA of C. acetobutylicum (ATCC824) with the
appropriate primer pairs (Supplementary Table S2) that contained
restriction adaptors of KasI at the 5¶ end and NdeI at the 3¶ end. These
amplified fragments of thlP and abrBP were first digested with NdeI and
then ligated with PCR-amplified NTR fragments predigested with AseI
enzymes. The resulting fragments were then amplified with either abrBPfwd/NTR-rev or thlP-fwd/NTR-rev primer pair (Supplementary Table S2).
These amplified promoter-NTR fragments were then digested with KasI and
XbaI and ligated with pMTL540FT predigested with the same set of
enzymes. These cloning procedures for replacing the fdP promoter in
pNTR540FT with the abrBP and thlP promoters were required because of
the presence of an internal NdeI site in both of the promoter regions. These
amplified promoter fragments were cloned immediately in front of the
coding sequence of NTR (UniProt P38489). These ligation mixtures were
introduced into E. coli GBE180 and then electroporated into C. sporogenes.
Positive clones were identified by restriction enzymes analysis and
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
A synthetic gene encoding NTR (sNTR) was synthesized (GenScript
Corp.), incorporating Clostridium preferred codons based on a codon usage

table of C. botulinum posted by Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba,
Japan. This sNTR nucleotide fragment was first cloned into pSC208
(Supplementary Table S1) and amplified with primer pairs of sNTR-fwd and
sNTR-rev, which contained restriction adaptors of the 5¶-end NdeI site and
3¶-end BamHI sites (Supplementary Table S2). Amplified sNTR fragments
were then digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with plasmids of
pNTR540FT, pSC205AT, and pSC207TT predigested with the same pair of
enzymes to create the new set of sNTR-expressing plasmids of pSC213FT
( fdP -sNTR), pSC214AT (abrBP -sNTR), and pSC215TT (thlP -sNTR).
All plasmids were first constructed in E. coli and then electroporated into
C. sporogenes.
Promoter strength assay by growth on selective media by dilution
plating. E. coli hosts harboring various promoter strength reporting
constructs were grown aerobically overnight in LB broth containing
250 Ag/mL erythromycin. The cultures were then transferred 1:100 into
fresh nonselective LB and grown to log phase. Serial 1:10 dilutions were
made from these log-phase cultures, and the cell densities adjusted to 0.4
(A 600) with fresh LB broth. A 15-AL aliquot of each dilution was spotted
on LB agar plates supplemented with increasing concentrations of
chloramphenicol ranging from 150 to 300 Ag/mL. The spotted agar plates
were scored by growth of each dilution spot after incubation at 37jC for
24 h. Similarly, clostridial transformants were grown overnight in liquid
TPGY medium containing 10 Ag/mL erythromycin at 37jC in a hypoxic
chamber. The next day, the transformants were transferred 1:100 into
fresh TPGY broth without erythromycin and grown to exponential phase.
Serial dilutions of 1:5 with TPGY broth were made from these log-phase
cultures; the cell densities were adjusted to 0.6 (A 600); and 15-AL aliquots
of each dilution were spotted on TPGY agar plates supplemented with
various concentration of chloramphenicol ranging from 2 to 10 Ag/mL.
The spotted agar plates were incubated at 37jC in a hypoxic chamber
for 48 to 72 h. The promoter strength was determined by the growth of
each dilution spot on the selective plates based on the resistance to
chloramphenicol expressed from the catP gene (35, 36). This measure of
promoter strength has been used earlier with C. perfringens (37).
Immunoblot analysis of NTR. A 15-mL overnight culture of clostridial
cells was collected by centrifugation, washed thrice with cold PBS,
resuspended in 1 mL of cold PBS, and lysed by three 30-s sonications
(VC130 sonicator, Sonics & Materials, Inc.) with the samples being kept on
ice for at least 2 min between each sonication. Protein concentrations were
determined by a Bradford assay (Protein Assay kit, Bio-Rad Lab, Inc.) with
bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lysed samples were run on 10% SDSPAGE mini-gels with a EI9001-Xcell II Mini Cell apparatus (Novex). Proteins
were transferred onto a 0.2-Am nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and
gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to check for uniform transfer.
Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T
(Dulbecco’s PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4jC and then
incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 1:5,000 dilution of a custommade anti-NTR polyclonal rabbit serum (Invitrogen) using an immunogen
of a synthetic peptide with the sequence of KGRKFFADMHRK
corresponding to amino acids 119 to 130 at the NH2 terminus of the
E. coli nfnB gene. Membranes were washed eight times in PBS-T and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Lab, Inc.) diluted 1:3,000. Antibody
was detected by enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences) with
a Storm 860 imaging system and quantitatively analyzed by ImageQuant TL
(Molecular Dynamics).
Assay of NTR activity. Quantitative NTR enzyme assays using PR-104A
(a generous gift from Professor W. Denny, University of Auckland, Auckland,
New Zealand) as the substrate were carried out at 37jC by highperformance liquid chromatography as previously described (38, 39). The
substrate (initially 50–800 Amol/L) was diluted from 2 to 32 mmmol/L stock
in DMSO and incubated at 37jC with cofactor [NAD(P)H at 1.0 mmol/L]
and cell extract (0.1–1 mg) in 500 AL of 100 mmol/L sodium phosphate.
Samples were taken at different time points and frozen immediately in
liquid nitrogen and then kept in 20jC until analyzed. The presence of NTR
activity was indicated by the disappearance of PR-104A. The final
concentration of DMSO in the reaction mixture was kept constant at

www.aacrjournals.org

2.5% (v/v) because this solvent is an inhibitor of enzyme activity if present at
>5% (v/v; ref. 38).
Loss of PR-104A by nitroreduction were determined using 10 to 100
AL of the final product in 500-AL assay mix using a reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography system with a diode array detector
(Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The mobile phase was a
gradient of 80% acetonitrile/water (A) and 0.45 mol/L ammonium
formate in water (pH 6.5) with 5% A initially for 0 to 2 min, increasing
in linear segments to 70% A at 15 min, then decreasing to 5% at 17 min,
and held at 5% for a further 3 min. The column was a 3.2  150 mm
Altima C8 column (Alltech Associates, Inc.) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/
min. Absorbance detection was at 330 nm (band width, 4 nm), with
quantification by integration of peak areas (Chemstation software) with
reference to standard curves prepared with authentic compounds in the
same medium. Standard curves were linear for all compounds (r 2 > 0.95;
GraphPad PRISM version 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Mice and tumors. Immunodeficient nude mice (Charles River) were
housed in sterile cages with autoclaved bedding and free access to food and
water. The human cervical carcinoma cell line SiHa was maintained in
Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
established from Mycoplasma-free frozen stocks every 3 mo. Cells were
harvested from monolayer cultures with 0.05% trypsin/1.8 mg/mL EDTA,
centrifuged, resuspended in medium, and inoculated s.c. at 5  106 to 8 
106 cells per mouse on the back f1 cm proximal to the base of the tail.
Tumor volume (V ) was calculated from three orthogonal Vernier caliper
measurements (a, b, and c) using the formula V = p/6(abc). Experiments
were initiated when tumor volume was f200 mm3. Tumor growth delay
was calculated in days for each tumor to reach thrice tumor volume at the
start of treatment. The growth delay was calculated within each group by
determining the days taken for the tumors to reach the thrice their initial
tumor volumes. The difference between the growth curves was analyzed for
statistical significance by using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posttest
(PRISM version 4.0, GraphPad). All animal procedures were approved by the
Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.
Drug preparation and treatment. PR-104 was prepared daily in PBS
containing one molar equivalent of sodium bicarbonate and used within
6 h of preparation. CB1954 was prepared freshly in 10% N,N-dimethylacetamide, 40% polyethylene glycol, and 50% double-distilled water (added just
before injection) and used within 6 h of preparation. PR-104 (250 mg/kg)
and CB1954 (50 mg/kg) were given i.p. 48 h after i.v. injection of clostridial
spores (1  108). Treatment with CB1954 was given only once and
treatment with PR-104 was repeated once a week for 3 wk. These protocols
were chosen based on our previously published studies (26) and on data
showing that these protocols were equally well tolerated (30% of the MTD of
each drug) and gave similar levels of antitumor activity.
In vivo imaging of NTR activity in nude mice. To image NTR activity
in vivo, we first conducted retroviral transduction of cytomegalovirus
(CMV)-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) into SiHa cells. GFP
expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. SiHa/GFP cells
(5–8  106) were suspended in 100-AL PBS and inoculated s.c. into the
dorsal area f1 cm proximal to the base of the tail of 6-wk-old female
immunodeficient nude mice. When the tumors reached a mean volume of
200 to 300 mm3, mice were given i.v. injections of saline or clostridial spores
transformed with sNTR. Two days later, 6-chloro-9-nitro-5-oxo-5H benzo[a]phenoxazine (CNOB), 100 Ag/mouse in 100% DMSO (Invitrogen),
was injected i.p. This nonfluorescent compound is metabolized by E. coli
NTR to a highly fluorescent aminophenoxazine, with fluorescence
excitation/emission maxima at 617/625 nm. After 24 h, mice were imaged
with a small-animal imaging Maestro system (CRi, Inc.). The collected
images were analyzed by following the spectral unmixing procedure in the
Maestro software (CRi).

hypoxia inducible vgbP) were cloned into a promoterless vector

Figure 1. Effect of catP expression driven by various promoters on
chloroamphenicol tolerance in recombinant C. sporogenes . Exponentially
growing cells were harvested and washed with fresh TPGY and equilibrated to an
A 600 of 0.6. Fivefold serial dilutions of each strain of cells were spotted on TPGY
plates supplemented with 2 to 10 Ag/mL of chloramphenicol and incubated
anaerobically for 72 h. A rough guide to promoter strength was ascertained by
the readout of the total growth of each dilution spot on the selective plates.
The image shows the data for the plate with 8 Ag/mL chloramphenicol.

of pJIR2717 and transformed into the E. coli host GBE180. We
assayed the promoter strength by dilution plating on LB plates
containing increasing concentrations of chloramphenicol or
its analogue, thiamphenicol, for clostridial catP expression. Our
results showed the following order of promoter strength
based on the catP expression in E. coli host as determined
by the resistance to chloramphenicol (data not shown):
glnAP z fdP > abrBP > thlP > ptbP > vgbP z adcP.
However, because the promoter strength assayed in E. coli
may not reflect the expression level in the clostridial host, we
electroporated these same seven promoter constructs into C.
sporogenes and assayed promoter strength by dilution plating
on TPGY plates containing increasing concentrations of
chloramphenicol for clostridial catP expression. Our results
from this promoter strength assay were as follows
(Fig. 1): abrBP z thlP > fdP > glnAP > vgbP > ptbP > adcP.

Thus, two strong promoters, abrBP and thlP, with similar
strengths in driving the expression of catP in C. sporogenes, were
identified. These two promoters were then selected for the next
round of cloning into vectors for NTR expression.
NTR expression in E. coli and clostridial transformants.
For optimized NTR expression vectors, we substituted thlP or
abrBP for fdP in our original NTR expression vector pNTR540FT.
The resulting plasmids were designated pSC205AT (with abrBPNTR) and pSC207TT (with thlP-NTR). Positive clones were
identified by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA
sequencing. In Western blot analysis, expression of NTR driven
by either thlP or abrBP was found to be f3-fold higher than
that driven by fdP (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in the
enzymatic assays (Fig. 4). However, despite these strong
promoters, there was still f50-fold higher NTR expression in
the E. coli host compared with the clostridial host transformed
with identical plasmids (Fig. 2), which we hypothesized was
because of very different codon uses between the two organisms
(Fig. 3A).
To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a novel gene encoding
NTR (sNTR), preserving the peptides sequence of E. coli nfnB (NTR)
but having a Clostridium preferred codon scheme based on a codon
usage table of C. botulinum posted by Kazusa DNA Research
Institute. The C. botulinum sequence was chosen because this gave
the highest correlation (R 2 = 0.96) of codon use frequency for all
known genes of C. sporogenes when plotted against that of all the
clostridial species with a sequenced genome (Fig. 3A). The close
relationship of these two species is also indicated by the >95%
sequence identity of nucleotide and protein level with the fldAIBC
gene cluster in C. sporogenes and that of C. botulinum Hall strain A
(40). Figure 3B shows a comparison of the nucleotide sequences of
the native and synthetic NTR genes with the changed codons
shown in red.
Superiority of the synthetic gene for expression in C.
sporogenes. In both Western and enzyme assays with cell extracts
from clostridial transformants harboring plasmid constructs of
thlP-sNTR and abrBP-sNTR, we found an improvement of 20- to
30-fold compared with the original construct of pNTR540FT
(Fig. 4). The constructs thlP-sNTR and abrBP-sNTR performed
equally well in both functional assays and Western blot analysis.
However, we chose the abrBP-sNTR/C. sporogenes construct for the
in vivo studies because of its superior sporulation efficiency than
the thlP-sNTR/ C. sporogenes construct.

cultures of recombinant E. coli and C. sporogenes by sonication. Cultures of wild-type C. sporogenes are also included as a negative control.

codon usage frequency of a given codon in both strains, the higher the correlation coefficient will be. Of all the genome-sequenced clostridial species, C. botulinum
possessed the highest correlation coefficient in codon usage frequency when plotted against that of C. sporogenes. B, alignment of nucleotides sequence of optimized
NTR (sNTR) and original NTR. Red, nucleotides not matched to the original NTR. Of note, there is only a 34% similarity in codon usage between sNTR and
the original NTR.

In vivo antitumor activity following systemic injection of
recombinant clostridial spores and dinitrobenzamide mustard prodrugs. We first determined if there was an effect of
spore transformation on tumor colonization, and we found no
difference in the number of C. sporogenes per gram of tumor
between transformed and nontransformed spores in SiHa human
tumor xenografts (data not shown). To compare the antitumor
activities of CDEPT with the new and prior constructs, we
injected mice bearing the SiHa tumor with clostridial spores

with or without the prodrug CB1954 or PR-104. The data show
that sNTR, CB1954, or PR-104 alone resulted in a small but
statistically insignificant delay in tumor growth (Fig. 5A and B).
However, when sNTR was combined with either CB1954 or PR104, we observed superior antitumor activity that was statistically significant (tumor growth delay >13 days; P < 0.05).
Treatment with E. coli NTR alone resulted in growth delay
similar to that with sNTR, and the combination with CB1954 or
PR-104 did not show a significant increase in antitumor activity.

Figure 4. A, Western blot analysis of NTR and sNTR expression driven by various promoters in recombinant E. coli and C. sporogenes. Total protein was obtained
from overnight cultures of recombinant E. coli and C. sporogenes harboring pNTR540FT (NTR driven by fdP ), pSC205AT (NTR driven by abrBP ), pSC207TT
(NTR driven by thlP ), pSC213FT (sNTR driven by fdP ), pSC214AT (sNTR driven by abrBP ), and pSC215TT (sNTR driven by thlP ). B, specific enzyme activity (Sp Act)
of NTR (mmol/min/mg of protein) plotted against the initial prodrug (PR-104) concentration (Amol/L) with total protein generated from recombinant C. sporogenes
harboring pNTR540FT, pSC205AT, pSC207TT, pSC213FT, pSC214AT, and pSC215TT. Cell extracts of wild-type C. sporogenes as the negative control and total
protein from recombinant E. coli harboring pSC214AT as a positive control were also included.

We also conducted Western blot analysis of tumor homogenates
on tumors treated in parallel to those in the growth delay
experiments and sacrificed 2 days following injection of recombinant spores. The data (Fig. 5C) show much higher levels of NTR
protein in the tumors of mice injected with C. sporogenes with the
sNTR compared with the native NTR.
In vivo imaging of the activity of clostridial spores
transformed with sNTR. As a test of whether it would be
possible to monitor in real time the activity of sNTR in the tumor,
we injected mice bearing the SiHa tumor transfected with CMVdriven GFP with spores of C. sporogenes transformed with the
sNTR-bearing plasmid. Two days later, we injected the nonfluorescent NTR substrate CNOB i.v. and, 24 hours later, imaged both
the GFP and red fluorescent signal from the metabolized CNOB
using a small-animal imaging Maestro system (Fig. 6). Preferential
metabolism of CNOB localized to the tumor can be clearly seen
with no evidence of normal tissue expression. In addition,
inhomogeneity of both signals is evident (inset), consistent with

maximum CNOB metabolism around an area of central necrosis
in the tumor.

Discussion
We have proposed that the unique presence in solid tumors of
necrotic and hypoxic regions could be exploited in cancer therapy
using a genetically engineered nonpathogenic strain of the
bacterial genus Clostridium (2, 41). The goal of the present study
was to develop an optimized heterologous gene expression system
in C. sporogenes for use in CDEPT. As a first step, we tested
promoters from five key metabolic pathway genes of Clostridium
and one hypoxia inducible promoter from Vitreoscilla. We found
two promoters (abrBP and thlP) that were superior to the
C. perfringens ferredoxin promoter in the construct used to drive
the E. coli–derived cytosine deaminase gene in the original CDEPT
studies (4). However, even with these promoters, there was much
lower expression (by f50-fold) of the E. coli–derived NTR gene in

Optimized Clostridium-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy

C. sporogenes compared with E. coli. We hypothesized that this was
the result of the very different codon usage between Clostridia and
E. coli, and we tested this by constructing a synthetic gene (sNTR)
with the same amino acid sequence as the E. coli NTR gene but
with the preferred clostridial codon usage. This produced a
significant improvement in gene expression such that the
combination of the strong promoter (abrBP or thlP) with the
synthetic NTR gene gave f20- to 30-fold higher expression levels
than the original NTR expression vector pNTR540FT. Thus, this
study shows significant progress in optimizing the enzyme
expression of E. coli–derived NTR in clostridial transformants
used in CDEPT to deliver prodrug-activating enzymes specifically
to tumors. With this system, we were able to show that ineffective
doses of the prodrugs CB1954 and PR-104, both currently in clinical
testing, could be converted into effective antitumor therapy by the
addition of recombinant C. sporogenes expressing the metabolizing
enzyme NTR (Fig. 5).
Although the improvements that we report here are significant, there are potentially others that could further improve the
efficacy of CDEPT. One such would be to replace the E. coli NTR
with a more active enzyme either naturally occurring or
genetically manipulated. Theys and colleagues (42), for example,
isolated an NTR-like protein from Haemophilus influenzae (NTR-H)

with slightly better characteristics than that of original E. coli
NTR gene (NfnB) in metabolizing CB1954 to its toxic species. In
addition, methods for genetic manipulation of the native enzyme
have been used to increase reduction efficacy. For example, Grove
and colleagues (43) have generated mutants of NfnB by amino
acid substitutions around the active site of the protein to produce a strain with a 5-fold improvement in enzyme kinetics
for reducing CB1954. Similarly, Barak and colleagues (44) used
directed evolution that introduces random mutations in NfnB
with error-prone PCR to improve the activity of the enzyme. In
a complementary manner, novel NTR prodrugs with enhanced
bystander effects such as the dinitrobenzamide mustard SN 28343
(45) may also provide improvements given that the tumor germination of clostridial vectors is constrained to necrotic and perinecrotic regions.
In conclusion, we report significant improvement in the
heterologous expression of the E. coli–derived NTR gene in a
clostridial host and much improved antitumor activity of i.v. injected
recombinant spores combined with two prodrugs in clinical use that
are converted by NTR to cytotoxic species. In addition, should it
prove necessary, other optimization strategies are available for use
with this system. We believe that this optimization process could
maximize the likely success of CDEPT in the clinic.

Figure 5. Superior antitumor activity of CDEPT with sNTR compared with the native NTR. All the tumors were treated with 108 spores on day 0 when they
reached a mean volume of 200 mm3. A, effect of combinations of recombinant spores with the prodrug CB1954 (50 mg/kg given once 48 h after i.v. injection of Clostridia
spores). B, effect of combinations of recombinant spores with the prodrug PR-104 (250 mg/kg given once per week for 3 wk starting 48 h after spore injection).
C, Western blot analysis of tumor homogenates taken 2 d after i.v. injection of the NTR-expressing spores. The upper band is a nonspecific band from SiHa tumors
and is proportional to the total amount of protein loaded. As can be seen from the two right-hand lanes, it is present in tumors from mice that did not receive an
injection of spores (Control #1 and #2 ).

Figure 6. Imaging of activity of transformed C. sporogenes
using the nonfluorescent substrate CNOB. SiHa tumors
transformed with CMV-driven GFP were implanted into
immunodeficient nude mice; when they reached a mean diameter
of 200 mm3, 108 spores of C. sporogenes transformed with
the abrBP /sNTR plasmid were injected i.v. Two days later, the
nonfluorescent CNOB was injected i.p. This nonfluorescent
compound is metabolized by E. coli NTR to a highly fluorescent
aminophenoxazine, with fluorescence excitation/emission
maxima at 617/625 nm. Mice were imaged with a small-animal
imaging Maestro system and the collected images were analyzed
using the spectral unmixing procedure in the Maestro software.
Inset, the metabolism of CNOB is preferentially metabolized
around a central necrotic core in the tumor. The mouse on the left
in each image is a control (non–tumor-bearing) mouse. This
study was done with three tumors, and all three showed similar
metabolism of CNOB to its fluorescent
metabolite.
