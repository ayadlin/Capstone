ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account for 15% of all breast cancers,
and represent one of the most aggressive forms of the disease, exhibiting short
relapse-free survival. In contrast to other breast cancer subtypes, the absence of
knowledge about the etiopathogenic alterations that cause TNBCs force the use of
chemotherapeutics to treat these tumors. Because of this, efforts have been devoted
with the aim of incorporating novel therapies into the clinical setting. Kinases play
important roles in the pathophysiology of several tumors, including TNBC. Since
expression of the MAP kinase ERK5 has been linked to patient outcome in breast
cancer, we analyzed the potential value of its targeting in TNBC. ERK5 was frequently
overexpressed and active in samples from patients with TNBC, as well as in explants
from mice carrying genetically-defined TNBC tumors. Moreover, expression of
ERK5 was linked to a worse prognosis in TNBC patients. Knockdown experiments
demonstrated that ERK5 supported proliferation of TNBC cells. Pharmacological
inhibition of ERK5 with TG02, a clinical stage inhibitor which targets ERK5 and
other kinases, inhibited cell proliferation by blocking passage of cells through G1
and G2, and also triggered apoptosis in certain TNBC cell lines. TG02 had significant
antitumor activity in a TNBC xenograft model in vivo, and also augmented the activity
of chemotherapeutic agents commonly used to treat TNBC. Together, these data
indicate that ERK5 targeting may represent a valid strategy against TNBC, and support
the development of trials aimed at evaluating the clinical effectiveness of drugs that
block this kinase.

Kinases play important roles in the pathophysiology
of several tumors, including TNBC [6]. ERK5 belongs
to the MAP kinase family of signal transducers [7], and
its deregulation has been linked to the pathophysiology
of breast cancer [8]. A recent report has indicated that
expression of ERK5 in breast tumors is linked to patient
outcome, since patients with tumors with high levels of
ERK5 have a poor prognosis as compared to those whose
tumors do not overexpress ERK5 [9]. In vitro studies have
shown that ERK5 is a critical mediator of growth factor
signaling in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer cell

INTRODUCTION
Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account
for 15% of all breast cancers, and represent one of
the most aggressive forms of the disease [1]. Despite
important research efforts aimed at identifying
molecular alterations in TNBC [2], the lack of known
etiopathogenic alterations has prevented the development
of targeted therapeutics in TNBC [3], and force the use of
chemotherapeutics such as taxanes or vinorelbine for the
management of TNBC [4, 5].

lines, and expression of a dominant-negative form of
ERK5 prevented growth factor-induced proliferation [8].
Moreover, in breast cancer cell lines which overexpress
HER2, ERK5 is constitutively active and inhibition of
ERK5 causes a decrease in proliferation of HER2+ cells
[8, 9]. Furthermore, knockdown of ERK5 favored the
action of drugs commonly used in the treatment of HER2+
breast cancer. Therefore, targeting of ERK5 may be of
therapeutic relevance in those subtypes of breast cancer.
These precedents raise the question of whether targeting
ERK5 could be beneficial in the treatment of TNBC.
Here we have analyzed the expression of ERK5 in
TNBC and the value of its targeting for the therapy of this
disease. We show that ERK5 expression levels correlate
with patient outcome in metastatic TNBC. The composite
analyses of the biochemical, genetic and pharmacologic
studies carried out in this work suggests that ERK5
targeting may be beneficial for the therapy of TNBC, and
open the possibility of clinically testing drugs that act on
ERK5 for the treatment of patients bearing this type of
tumors.

ERK5 knockdown reduces the proliferation of
triple negative breast cancer cells

RESULTS

The above data suggested that blocking ERK5
activity may have potential as a therapeutic strategy in
TNBC. With the aim of translating these findings to the
clinic, we used TG02, a pyrimidine-based macrocycle with
ERK5 inhibitory properties [12], which may also target
other kinases [13]. We selected this compound instead
of other ERK5 inhibitors [14] because TG02 is the only
clinical stage ERK5 inhibitor, currently in phase I studies
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01204164).
We evaluated the action of TG02 on ERK5 in intact
TNBC cells. Under resting conditions, ERK5 migrates as
a 120 kDa protein, and upon activation ERK5 undergoes
a mobility shift easily detected by Western blotting
[15]. That mobility shift is caused by phosphorylation
of ERK5 at its TEY activation domain, as well as by
phosphorylation of other residues at the C-terminal region
of ERK5. Phosphorylations at the TEY microdomain are
due to the ERK5 upstream activation kinase MEK5, while
phosphorylations at the C-terminus depend on ERK5,
and are expected to occur by autophosphorylation [16].
In MDA-MB231 cells treatment with EGF caused a
mobility shift of ERK5 (Figure 3A, top panel), indicative
of activation. Preincubation with TG02 inhibited EGFinduced ERK5 mobility shift, suggesting that TG02 was
able to inhibit ERK5 in vivo. To demonstrate that this
effect of TG02 was not due to inhibition of MEK5, we
used an antibody which specifically recognizes ERK5
phosphorylated at its TEY microdomain [8]. Addition
of EGF resulted in detection of pERK5 by this antibody
(Figure 3A, middle panel). In cells treated with EGF,
preincubation with TG02 caused a shift in the mobility of
ERK5, which migrated faster. Yet ERK5 was recognized
by the anti-pERK5 antibody, suggesting that the activity

The elevated expression of ERK5 in TNBC,
together with its prognostic relevance, led us to explore
the value of targeting this kinase as a strategy against this
type of tumors. For this purpose, we used human TNBC
cell lines. All the cell lines tested expressed ERK5, and
some of them contained phosphorylated forms of ERK5
(Figure 2A). We used knockdown of ERK5 to evaluate
the impact of reducing its expression on the proliferation
of TNBC on several of these cell lines. Western blotting
demonstrated that infection with a shRNA that targets the
mRNA for ERK5 reduced its protein levels (Figure 2B).
Knockdown of ERK5 decreased their proliferation (Figure
2C). Knockdown experiments were also performed on
HCC1187 cells. These cells proved to be extremely
sensitive to ERK5 knockdown (Figure S1).

Action of a clinical stage ERK5 inhibitor in
triple negative breast cancer

ERK5 expression is linked to patient outcome in
triple negative breast cancer
We evaluated the relationship between ERK5
expression and patient outcome in specific subsets
of metastatic (lymph node positive) breast cancer. To
this end, we used a publicly available database, which
includes microarray expression data and clinical follow
up from breast cancer patients [10]. Kaplan-Meier plots
showed association between ERK5 expression and patient
outcome in the basal type of breast cancer, which shares
genomic and pathologic characteristics with TNBC, as
well as in HER2+ tumors (Figure 1A). In contrast, these
analyses failed to show any association between ERK5
expression and patient outcome in metastatic luminal A or
metastatic luminal B.
The expression of ERK5 protein in tumor samples
from patients with TNBC, analyzed by Western blot,
showed that ERK5 was expressed in these samples,
although at distinct levels (Figure 1B). Comparison
of ERK5 levels of tumors samples to normal breast
tissue (BT2561N) showed that ERK5 expression in
TNBCs was higher than in the normal breast tissue.
Interestingly, a number of tumor tissue samples contained
a slower migrating form of ERK5, which corresponds to
phosphorylated ERK5 (pERK5) [8]. We also explored
ERK5 levels in tumors derived from mice with genomic
and pathologic characteristics of TNBCs [11]. Tumors
from these mice (BT1, BT2, and BT3) also displayed
elevated levels of ERK5, as compared to non-tumoral
(NB1, NB2) breast tissue (Figure 1C).

TG02 delays cell cycle progression

of MEK5 was preserved. Together, these data demonstrate
that TG02 can inhibit ERK5 in live MDA-MB231 cells.
To verify that TG02 directly inhibited ERK5
activity we settled up a novel in vitro assay based on
the kinase activity of ERK5 [12]. In this assay, ERK5 is
used as both the enzyme and the substrate, because of its
autophosphorylation properties. We used ERK5 isolated
from non-stimulated as well as EGF-stimulated MDAMB231 cells as a source of inactive or active kinase,
respectively. When active ERK5 immunoprecipitated
from MDA-MB231 cells treated with EGF was subjected
to the in vitro assay, an additional shift in its mobility
was observed, indicative of hyperphosphorylation
(Figure 3B, lane 4). This supershift of ERK5 is due to
autophosphorylation, and results in the appearance of two
different bands which correspond to hyperphosphorylated
ERK5 forms (ppERK5-I and pERK5-II). In the absence of
EGF stimulation, immunoprecipitated ERK5 was unable
to undergo any mobility shift (Figure 3B, lane 3). These
data indicated that for these in vitro kinase assays ERK5
required previous in vivo activation. Incubation of active
ERK5 with TG02 dose-dependently prevented the in vitro
autophosphorylation of ERK5 (Figure 3B, lanes 5-13).
Quantitative analyses of the fully hyperphosphorylated
form (ppERK5-I) indicated that the in vitro inhibitory IC50
value of TG02 towards ERK5 was 100 nM (Figure 3C).
The action of TG02 was analyzed on eight TNBC
cell lines. As shown in Figure 3D, growth and/or survival
were inhibited by TG02 in all the TNBC cell lines.
IC50 values were lower as incubation times increased
(Figure S2A and S2B).
We next analysed the in vivo effect of TG02 on
tumors derived by xenografting MDA-MB231. As shown
in Figure 3E, treatment of mice injected with MDAMB231 cells with TG02 delayed tumor growth.
As most antitumor treatments are based on
combinations of drugs [17], we explored whether TG02
favoured the action of drugs used in the therapy of TNBC.
Drug combinations were performed following the constant
ratio protocol used in the Chou and Talalay algorithm [18].
Figure 3F shows the data for the best combinations as well
as the combination indices obtained. TG02 synergized
with conventional anti-TNBC treatments, as indicated by
combination indices below 1. At the concentrations used
for these combination experiments, the chemotherapeutic
agents did not affect ERK5 status in live cells (Figure S2C).
To evaluate whether these chemotherapeutics could
directly affect ERK5 activity we performed in vitro kinase
experiments. None of these treatments affected ERK5
activity (Figure S2D), neither at the concentrations used
in the combination experiments (lanes 5-7), nor at much
higher concentrations (Lanes 9-11). In contrast, TG02,
used as a control, inhibited ERK5 activity. These results
led us to conclude that the chemotherapeutic drugs used do
not inhibit the activity of ERK5.

The decrease in MTT metabolization caused by
TG02 could be due to a decrease in cell proliferation,
augmented cell death, or both. To analyze this, we carried
out propidium iodide (PI) staining of MDA-MB231 and
HCC1187 cells treated with TG02. In MDA-MB231 cells,
treatment with the drug caused accumulation of the cells in
the G2/M phase (Figure 4A). The drug also increased the
subG0 population, particularly in HCC1187, indicative of
stimulation of cell death. These results indicated that the
antitumor action of TG02 was complex and involved cell
cycle and apoptotic mechanisms.
To analyse the effect of TG02 on the cell cycle
we used synchronization agents that block cell cycle
progression at different phases, followed by release from
these blockers in the absence or presence of TG02. For
these experiments, we used MDA-MB231 on which
a clear effect of TG02 on the cell cycle was observed
(Figure 4A).
Synchronization of MDA-MB231 cells at late G1
by a double thymidine block followed by release in the
absence or presence of TG02 indicated that progression
of cells along S phase was unaffected by treatment with
the drug (Figure 4B). In fact, the PI histograms at 3 and
6 hours after release of control and TG02-treated cells
were indistinguishable, and at 6 hours after release most
of the cells had reached G2/M. In untreated cells, and
12-24 hours after release, a substantial amount of cells
had progressed from mitosis into G1. In contrast, TG02treated cells suffered a clear delay in their progression
through the G2/M phase. Biochemically, phosphorylation
of the mitotic marker histone H3 progressively increased
in untreated cells (Figure 4C). In contrast, in TG02-treated
cells phosphorylation of histone H3 was minimal. The
lack of significant p-Histone H3 increases in cells treated
with TG02 suggested that the drug impaired entry of cells
into mitosis, and therefore could be impeding G2→M
progression. Dephosphorylation of tyrosine 15 of CDK1
is required for entry into M phase [19]. Phosphorylation
of this site is under the control of the kinase Wee1 and
the phosphatase CDC25C. In control cells, pCDK1Tyr15
levels decreased after 12 hours. At this time, the amount
of Wee1 was analogous to that present at other chase
times, indicating that pCDK1Tyr15 dephosphorylation
likely occurred by increased action of CDC25C. TG02
caused an accumulation of Wee1 (Figure 4C) and inhibited
pCDK1Tyr15 dephosphorylation, which is indicative of
CDK1/cyclin B complex inactivity.
To analyze whether TG02 also affects the transition
through G1, MDA-MB231 cells were synchronized in
mitosis with nocodazole, and then released in the absence
or presence of TG02. Cell cycle profiles (Figure 4D)
as well as phosphorylation of histone H3 (Figure 4E)
confirmed that MDA-MB231 cells were arrested in mitosis

block (B, C) or in mitosis with nocodazole (D, E), followed by release in the absence or presence of TG02 (100 nM). Cell cycle profiles

after nocodazole blockade. TG02 did not substantially
affect exit from mitosis, since 3 hours after release most
of the cells had progressed into the G1 phase (Figure 4D).
These results are in accordance with the data mentioned
above indicating that TG02 acted on a step previous to
the nocodazole-affected checkpoint. However, treatment
with TG02 profoundly influenced the capability of MDAMB231 cells to progress through the G1 phase into the
S phase as demonstrated by comparison of the cell cycle
profiles, particularly at 12 and 15 hours after release.
Progression through the G1 phase requires the coordinate
and sequential activation of several cyclin/CDK complexes
[19]. Cyclins D1 and D3 in concert with CDK4/CDK6
act early in G1, and their activity is commonly detected
by changes in Rb phosphorylation [20]. This facilitates
the expression of other proteins involved in G1/S phase
transition such as cyclin A, needed to activate CDK2 [21].
pRbSer780 and pRbSer807/811 levels decreased in cells treated
with TG02 (Figure 4E). The gradual dephosphorylation
of pRb in cells treated with TG02 could be responsible
for the inhibition of cyclin A increase in expression, as
compared with untreated MDA-MB231 cells.

caused release of SMAC/DIABLO from the mitochondria.
This protein acts as an inhibitor of the Inhibitor of
Apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins [22], which were also
down-regulated by TG02 in HCC1187 cells (Figure 5B).
The release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria
to the cytosol suggested that caspases could contribute to
TG02-induced cell death. Treatment with TG02 provoked
fragmentation of caspases 8, 7, 9 and 3 (Figure 5B). In
addition, cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1 was also
observed in cells treated with TG02. The involvement of
caspases in the death process induced by TG02 was further
analyzed using the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK.
HCC1187 cells were preincubated for 60 minutes with
the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and then treated with
TG02. FACS analyses showed that Z-VAD-FMK partially
inhibited TG02-induced death (Figure 5D), indicating that a
proportion of the observed cell death was caspase-dependent.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we show that ERK5 levels are
frequently elevated in tumors from patients with TNBC.
Furthermore, a relationship was found between high levels
of ERK5 and worse prognosis in metastatic TNBC. In
addition, we show that tumors from mice engineered to
develop TNBC-like tumors also express elevated levels of
ERK5 as compared to normal breast from the same mice.
These data provided a springboard for further studies to
determine the potential of ERK5 targeting in TNBC.
Experiments in which ERK5 was knocked down
suggested that ERK5 targeting may be beneficial in
TNBC, prompting us to evaluate the anti-TNBC activity
of the clinical-stage inhibitor TG02. That drug decreased
MTT metabolization of all of the TNBC lines tested at
pharmacologically-achievable concentrations. Moreover,
TG02 reduced tumor growth in vivo, and synergized
with standard-of-care drugs used in the TNBC clinic,
supporting the concept that TG02 may offer clinical
benefit in this underserved cancer. Furthermore, since
kinase addition appears to be a characteristic of tumors
[23-25], agents such as TG02 which act on multiple
kinases may be considered to expand the antitumoral
therapeutic armamentarium.
The mechanisms behind cell death triggered by TG02
are likely to be multifactorial. TG02 provoked a delay in
cell cycle progression and stimulated cell death. In MDAMB231 cells, synchronization experiments indicated that
treatment with the drug caused a delay in G1→S and G2→M
transitions. ERK5 has been implicated in the regulation of
G1→S [15, 26] and G2→M [14, 27] transitions, and this
suggests that the action of TG02 on the cell cycle may rely,
at least in part, on its ERK5-inhibitory properties. However,
while ERK5 may influence cell cycle progression by
regulating some cyclin/CDK complexes [26], a direct effect
of TG02 on CDKs [13] cannot be excluded, and probably
adds to the ERK5-dependent cell cycle regulatory properties.

Effect of TG02 on apoptosis
To analyse the mechanisms of apoptotic cell death
triggered by TG02 we used HCC1187 cells. In this cell line
TG02 had a more marked proapoptotic effect, assessed by
propidium iodide staining and DNA laddering, as compared
to MDA-MB231 (Figure 5A and Figure S3). Mitochondria
play an important role in the induction of apoptosis through
the release of apoptotic mediators that follows increased
permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane [22]. To
investigate whether TG02 altered mitochondrial integrity
we analyzed mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm).
Analysis by flow cytometry with TMRE revealed that TG02
provoked a progressive decrease in ∆Ψm (Figure 5A).
Proteins of the BCL2 family act as major regulators
of the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability [22].
TG02 decreased the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins
MCL1 and BCL2 (Figure 5B). Moreover, treatment with
TG02 provoked cleavage of the proapoptotic BCL2 family
member BID, which may facilitate permeabilization of the
outer mitochondrial membrane. To check if TG02 induced
release of proapoptotic mediators from the mitochondrial
intermembrane space, we carried out subcellular
fractionation of HCC1187 cells. Cytochrome C along with
the cytoplasmic protein Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 form the
apoptosome, a macromolecular complex that causes the
activation of effector caspase 3 [22]. As shown in Figure
5C, the amount of cytochrome C in mitochondria decreased
after treatment with TG02, and an ensuing accumulation in
the cytosol was observed. TG02 also decreased AIF and
Endo G expression in the mitochondrial fraction. These two
proteins are known to trigger apoptosis through caspase­­
independent mechanisms. In addition, TG02 treatment

TG02 activated a proapoptotic program in TNBC
cells, as evidenced by increases in mitochondrial
permeability which caused release of cytochrome C,
SMAC/DIABLO, AIF and endonuclease G into the
cytoplasm. Release of some of these mediators may be
responsible for the cleavage and activation of caspases. The
proapoptotic activity of TG02 is most probably driven by
down regulation of survival proteins of the BCL2 family.
TG02 inhibits CDK9 [13] and blockade of CDK9-dependent
phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II reduces transcription
rates [28], selectively depleting short-lived survival proteins
including MCL-1, BCL2 and the IAP2 without altering
expression of more stable relatives, such as BCLXL. In
HCC1187 cells, TG02 treatment rapidly induced the
activation of caspase-dependent cell death, an interpretation
supported by the ability of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK to delay and partially restrict cell death. However, the
partial inhibition of cell death using this compound indicated
that caspase-independent mechanisms may also play a role
in the action of TG02. In this respect, it is worth noting that
AIF and endonuclease G may facilitate caspase-independent
cell death when released from the mitochondria to the
cytosolic and nuclear compartments [22].
In summary, our data show that ERK5 is frequently
overexpressed in TNBC. Genetic knockdown studies
demonstrated that ERK5 participated in the proliferation
of TNBC cells, and treatment with the inhibitor TG02 had
an antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo. These results, in
addition to revealing the relevance of ERK5 in TNBC, open
the door to the clinical evaluation of TG02 in the breast
cancer clinic, especially in combination with standardof-care chemotherapies used in the treatment of TNBC.

as analyses of proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis
were performed as described [30]. Western blotting and
immunoprecipitation were carried out as described [31].

In vitro kinase assay
MDA-MB2321 cells treated with or without EGF
(10 nM, 15 min) were collected and lysed in ice-cold lysis
buffer; 1 mg of protein extract was immunoprecipitated
with the anti-ERK5-PRO1(R415) antibody at 4°C for

at least 2 h, and the immune complexes were recovered
by a short centrifugation, followed by three washes with
1 ml of cold lysis buffer and two washes with 1 ml of
kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6; 20 mM MgCl2;
25  mM β-glycerophosphate). The immunoprecipitates
were then incubated with different concentrations of TG02
(10-10 000 nM) for 1 hour at room temperature and after
this time ATP and sodium orthovanadate were added to
a final concentration of 100 μM and kinase reaction was
performed at 30ºC for 30 min. Samples were analyzed
by Western blotting with the anti-ERK5 (C-terminal)
antibody and the ERK5 activity plotted in a graphic as a
percent of control (maximum activity).

In vivo studies
For the in vivo analyses, 9-10 week old nu/nu
mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. Indianapolis, IN)
were subcutaneously inoculated into the right flank with
5 x 106 MDA-MB231 cells and when tumors reached a
size of 80-120 mm3, mice were randomized in two groups:
Group 1 (control group that received the vehicle alone);
and Group 2 (TG02 46.92 mg/kg orally every day). Tumor
growth was evaluated twice a week and animals were
euthanized when their tumors reached 1,500 mm3.
Statistical analyses were performed with the
program SPSS-17.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL), and
statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. All animal
experiments were performed according to the protocols
approved by the Charles River.
