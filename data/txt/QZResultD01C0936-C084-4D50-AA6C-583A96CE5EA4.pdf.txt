ABSTRACT
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) plays a crucial role in the
resistance of apoptosis in carcinogenesis; however, its targeted small-molecule
inhibitors still remain to be discovered. Thus, in this study, we computationally and
experimentally screened a series of small-molecule inhibitors targeting ERK toward
different types of human breast cancer cells. Subsequently, we synthesized some
candidate ERK inhibitors, identified a novel ERK inhibitor (BL-EI001) with antiproliferative activities, and analyzed the BL-EI001/ERK complex. Moreover, we
found that BL-EI001 induced breast cancer cell apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway
but independent on Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. In addition, we carried out proteomics
analyses for exploring some possible BL-EI001-induced apoptotic pathways, and
further found that BL-EI001-induced apoptosis affected ERK phosphorylation in
breast cancer. Further, we found that BL-EI001 bear anti-tumor activities without
remarkable toxicities, and also induced mitochondrial apoptosis by targeting ERK
in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in silico design and
experimental discovery of a synthesized small-molecule ERK inhibitor (BL-EI001)as
a potential novel apoptosis-inducing drug in the treatment of breast cancer.

nuclear signaling pathway mechanisms [4]. The ERK
signaling pathway has been known to play a crucial role
in carcinogenesis, including resistance of apoptosis by
activating several anti-apoptotic protein (e.g., Bcl-XL and
Mcl-1) or inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bim, Bad
and caspase 9) [5]. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated multistep pathway that is responsible for cell death not only
during development, but in adult multicellular organisms
[6]. Deregulation of apoptosis can lead to an accumulation
of undead cells and contribute to cancer development [7].
Thus, inhibiting the ERK pathway may be a potential
therapeutic strategy for preventing the resistance of
apoptosis in cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are
serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that can regulate
cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis
[1, 2]. The classic MAPK family consists of 4 subfamilies:
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-JunN-terminal kinases (JNKs), the p38MAPKs and ERK-5.
Amongst them, ERKs (ERK1/2) are the important signal
transduction enzymes, identified by the specificity motif
TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) sequence in their activation sites [3].
ERKs are terminal kinases in the cellular transduction
pathways connecting the cell surface receptors to the

Hitherto, cancer drug development has profited from
accumulating understanding of apoptotic mechanisms for
several years, and till now, some small-molecule compounds
targeting the ERK pathway have been evaluated in vitro and
in vivo tests. Initial small-molecule inhibitor development
has been focused on pyrazolopyridazines such as FR180204,
which is a modest ERK inhibitor [8]. Afterwards, a
pyrimidylpyrrole-based ERK inhibitor VTX-11e, has been
reported to be a potent ERK inhibitor with oral bioavailability
[9]. The strong activation of ERK in apoptosis resistant tumors
suggests direct targeting of ERK as an attractive strategy
for clinical cancer trials. At least two ERK inhibitors are in
phase I studies, including MK8353, a clinical grade analog
of SCH772984, and BVD-523 [10]. Recently, SCH772984
has been shown to be a selective and potent ERK1/2 inhibitor
which preferentially affects cell survival of BRCA2-deficient
breast cancer cells, as well as also induces apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in BRAF-mutant or non-BRAF-mutant melanoma
[10–12]. However, discovery of novel ERK inhibitors and
elucidation relevant molecular mechanisms still remain in its
infancy for the current cancer therapy.
Thus, in this study, we identified a novel smallmolecule ERK inhibitor (BL-EI001), supported by a series
of computational design and experimental validation,
indicating that BL-EI001 may be a promising apoptosisinducing drug for future breast cancer therapy.

could react with imidazole to produce 2-(1H-imidazol1-yl)-1-phenylethanoneintermediates in the condition
of heating at 70°C and in present of triethylamine, and
then the yielding product is condensed with potass­
ium borohydrideby heating at 70°C to give the redu­
ced products, 2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1-phenylethanol
intermediates. The condensation of 2-(1H-imidazol-1yl)-1-phenylethanol intermediates with chloromethyl
substituted aromatic compounds in the presence of NaH
in refluxing dioxane gives the adduct, which was finally
purified by silica-gel column chromatography using PEEA as an eluent to obtain the final product. The chemical
synthesis and structures of BL-EI001-BL-EI005 were
shown (Figure 2), and more detailed information was
provided as well (Table S3).
From the results of molecular modeling, docking and
dynamic stimulation of targeted compounds, we found that
the nitrogen of the imidazole ring plays an important role
in the interaction with the active sites. Thus, our molecular
design retains the pharmacophore imidazole ring (Figure
3A). Docking of new compound BL-EI001 showed that the
compound interacted with the active sites of the enzymes
through hydrophobic interactions between its aromatic
ring and ILE48, VAL56, ALA69 and MET125 amino-acid
residues, respectively. Moreover, BL-EI001 formed two
hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen of LYS71, and two Pi-Pi
interactions with TYR53. (Figure 3A). Therefore, BL-EI001
might have better kinase-binding activity than E1. All the
detailed information was shown (Table S4 and Table S5).

RESULTS
Molecular modeling, docking screening and
anti-proliferative activities of ERK inhibitors
toward breast cancer cells

BL-EI001 induces apoptosis in breast
adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells
BL-EI001 caused a significant anti-proliferative
effect on MCF-7, MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cell
growth in dose-dependent manner, and the treatment with
5 μM BL-EI001 for 24 h resulted in almost 50% inhibition
in MCF-7 cells. Also, the treatment with 15 μM and
20 μM BL-EI001 for 24 h resulted in almost 50% inhibition
in MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells, respectively
(Figure 3B). To characterize the BL-EI001-induced MCF-7
cell growth inhibition, we observed the morphologic
changes in the cells. When the cells were cultured with
5 μM BL-EI001 for 24 h, the apoptotic ultrastructural
alterations were also observed under electron microscope.
And, the marked apoptotic morphologic alterations were
observed by inverted microscopy, as well as by Hoechst
33258 staining under florescence microscopy (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, the long-term effects of BL-EI001 on
cell survival were determined using a colony formation
assay. The results showed that BL-EI001 significantly
suppressed cell proliferation, as indicated by the decreased
number of cell colonies in the BL-EI001-treated group
(Figure 4B). In addition, apoptosis was evaluated by the
measurement of cell number in SubG1 region. BL-EI001
markedly induced the increase of SubG1 cells proportion in

In this study, we carried out the molecular modeling
of ERK1 based on its crystallographic structure (Figure 1A).
We screened the structure-based candidate small-molecule
compounds that could target ERK from Drugbank and
ZINC, respectively. Subsequently, we achieved some
small-molecule compounds from Drugbank that could bind
their target ERK1/2 very well (Table S1). In addition, we
achieved other small molecule compounds from ZINC that
could also bind their target ERK1/2 very well (Table S2).
Thus, we show the top eleven compounds from Drugbank
and ZINC for further studies (Figure 1B). Next, we obtained
eleven compounds through the commercial purchase or
chemical synthesis named E1-E11. Then, the MTT assay
was conducted with these compounds in MCF-7, MDAMB468 and MDA-MB231 cells, respectively. As we could
see, compound E1 had good inhibitory activity, and the
inhibition was dose-dependent (Figure 1C).

MCF-7  cells (Figure 4C). Moreover, BL-EI001-induced
apoptosis was also measured by flow cytometry after
Annexin V-PI staining (Figure 4D). Altogether, these results
suggest that BL-EI001 induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.

Next, Bax expression was increased whereas Bcl-2
expression was decreased in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5B).
These results clearly indicate that BL-EI001-induced
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated by the mitochondrial
pathway. Then, we investigated the involvements of
caspase 9 and caspase 3 in BL-EI001-induced apoptosis.
Caspase 9 activation was determined by measurement of
the active forms of caspase 9. The active form of caspase
3 was observed during BL-EI001 treatment (Figure 5B).
Moreover, we found that the expressions of Ras, c-Raf, p-cRaf, MEK, p-MEK were not changed in BL-EI001-treated

in 14 groups in the two breast cancer cells (Figure 6B). Then,
we used these differential expression proteins to construct the
ERK network in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. In MCF7 cells, three differential expression proteins such as BIRC6,
HMGB1 and AIFM2 were predicted to interact with ERK or
to be affected by ERK (Figure 6C).
Next, we found that BIRC6 and HMGB1 were
down-regulated whilst AIFM2 was up-regulated after
treated with BL-EI001 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 7A). To
examine the relationship between ERK and HMGB1,
we found that the expression of HMGB1 was decreased
significantly while the expression p-ERK1/2 was abruptly
decreased under this condition (Figure 7B), suggesting
that p-ERK1/2 affect HMGB1 activation in BL-EI001treated MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we found that p-ERK1/2
expression was significantly decreased in BL-EI001treated MCF-7 cell apoptosis (Figure 7C). Moreover,

Proteomics analyses of BL-EI001-induced
apoptotic pathways in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231
cells
To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying BLEI001-induced apoptosis, iTRAQ and MS/MS analysis was
employed to profile differentially expressed proteins in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells treated with BL-EI001, respectively.
About thousands of differentially expressed proteins were
defined based on both high fold-change and observed in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 6A) (Table S6). We
annotated them and grouped the 128 apoptosis-related proteins

caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation are mainly dependent
on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BL-EI001-induced
apoptosis and also almost disappeared with siRNA
(Figure 7C), suggesting that BL-EI001-induced apoptosis
may be dependent on ERK phosphorylation.

Given the therapeutic efficacy of BL-EI001 in
our in vivo model, we examined the caspase 3, Bcl-2,
Bax and p-ERK1/2 expressions in tumor samples Imm­
unoreactivity. As shown in Figure 6A, active form of
caspase 3 was observed in the tumor. And, p-ERK1/2
and Bcl-2 were also inhibited by BL-EI001 whereas
Bax expression was increased (Figure 9A). We further
demonstrated that both Bax and Bcl-2 expression in
BL-EI001-treated tumor samples were consistent with
immunohistochemistry results and caspase cascade
activation. In addition, DNA repairing protein PARP-1
was sheared significantly (Figure 9B). Moreover, phos­
phorylation of ERK was inhibited, which was the same
as the in vitro results. These results demonstrate that
BL-EI001 bears remarkable anti-tumor effect, induces
apoptosis and affects ERK phosphorylation in vivo.

Anti-tumor activity of BL-EI001 in vivo
To evaluate the efficacy of BL-EI001 in MCF-7
cells in nude mice, we used three different doses of­
BL-EI001. Compared with the control group, median
and high BL-EI001 doses can inhibit the growth of
human breast tumor significantly in nude mice in a
time dependent and dose dependent manner (P < 0.001)
(Figure 8A). At the end of the experiment, the liver and
kidney weights of mice were not affected in all dose
groups while the spleen weights were lightly decreased
(P < 0.01), no other obvious toxicity was observed in
mice. We obtained identical results by directly measuring
the tumor volumes. In the three BL-EI001 groups, the
tumor volumes were much smaller than the control group
(Figure 8B). Immunoreactivity for Ki-67, a marker of
proliferation, was localized to the cell nuclei. BL-EI001
treatment significantly reduced the number of Ki-67positive MCF-7 cells compared to the control treatment
(Figure 8C), suggesting that BL-EI001-induced apoptosis
can inhibit tumor cell proliferation.

DISCUSSION
The activity of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade has
been widely reported to be increased in one-third of human
cancers, and inhibition of components of this cascade by
targeted inhibitors represents a key therapeutic strategy in
cancer [13]. Recent drug discovery has significantly benefited
from a rapid progress for understanding how to target
protein kinases such as ERK with small-molecule inhibitors
in cancer therapy [14]. Previous studies have shown the

structure-guided design of potent and selective
pyrimidylpyrrole inhibitors of ERK using conformational
control and structure–activity relationship studies of
3-(2-amino-ethyl)-5-(4-ethoxybenzylidene)-thiazolidine-2,4dione as a potential substrate specific ERK1/2 inhibitors
[15, 16]. Distinctive from these ERK inhibitors, we
computationally screened a series of candidate smallmolecule inhibitors from Drugbank and ZINC. Based on the
MTT assay of three types of breast cancer cells, we choose
a candidate small-molecule compound E1 and synthesized a
series of E1 derivatives and eventually found a novel ERK
inhibitor (BL-EI001) by further MTT assay in breast cancer
cells. Moreover, we used MD simulation to further validate
our new synthesized BL-EI001 could bind ERK better than
E1, indicating that BL-EI001 is a potent ERK inhibitor.
And, we also showed that the anti-proliferative activity of
BL-EI001 was greatly improved (IC50 = 5 μM, 24 h). Thus,
a novel ERK inhibitor (BL-EI001) has been successfully
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

designed and discovered as a candidate anti-tumor drug to
possess remarkable anti-proliferative activity toward breast
cancer cells by the combination of computational prediction
and experimental screening.
Apoptosis is triggered by the extrinsic (death receptor)
or intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Caspases are linked to
Bcl-2 family which is the key regulator of apoptosis and often
over-expresses in cancer [17]. Mitochondrial pathways has
been reported that apoptosome-dependent caspase activation
depends on the concentration of XIAP, indicating the key
roles of procapase 9, Apaf-1, and caspase 3, as well as of a
positive feedback loop between caspase 3 and caspase 9
[18, 19]. In our study, we found that the ERK inhibitor (BLEI001) can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway
in MCF-7 cells. And, we also demonstrated that BL-EI001
induced apoptosis not dependent on Ras/Raf/MEK pathway in
MCF-7 cells. Previous study has reported that ERK1/2 docking
domain inhibitors can induce apoptosis by targeting Rsk-1 and

caspase 9 [20]. And, statins and farnesyl transferase inhibitors
have also been reported to affect ERK phosphorylation,
and induce apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [21].
Moreover, SCH772984, as a selective and potent ERK1/2
inhibitor, has been recently shown to induce apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in BRAF-mutant or non-BRAF-mutant melanoma
[11, 12]. To our knowledge, no targeted ERK inhibitor has
been reported to be computationally designed, chemically
synthesized and experimentally explored its intricate
apoptosis-inducing mechanisms in breast cancer. Thus, in
our study, we demonstrate that BL-EI001 can induce MCF-7
mitochondrial apoptosis and is independent on Ras/Raf/MEK
pathway, suggesting that it may be a potential novel ERK
inhibitor in breast cancer.
Moreover, our proteomics experimental data further
provides thousands of differential protein expressions
in BL-EI001-induced apoptosis toward both MCF-7 and
MDA-MB231 cells. Based upon the apoptotic context,
novel ERK-regulated apoptotic pathways were identified
from thousands of proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231
cells, respectively. These results show that iTRAQ-based
identification of potential ERK interactors would be helpful
to be utilized for the discovery of more novel apoptotic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways in breast cancer. In BL-EI001-treated MCF-7
cells, we found ERK might affect BRIC6, HMGB1 and
AIFM2. Then, we validated the ERK-HMGB1 pathway
was in BL-EI001-treated MCF-7 cells. More impor­
tantly, we further found BL-EI001-induced apoptosis
was dependent on ERK phosphorylation, suggesting BLEI001 is a potential targeted ERK inhibitor. Moreover, in
our study, we found that EI001 bear the good anti-tumor
activities without remarkable toxicities in kidney, liver
and spleen, and induced apoptosis by targeting ERK
phosphorylation in vivo. Interestingly, ERK1/2 inhibition
has been reported to enhance apoptosis induced by JAK2
silencing in human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells [22].
In addition, other studies have demonstrated that ERK
inhibition overcomes acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors
[23, 24]. Thus, combination therapy with some ERK
inhibitors and other kinase inhibitors would be utilized as a
promising novel strategy for future cancer therapy.
In conclusion, we computationally designed and
experimentally identified a novel synthesized ERK
inhibitor (BL-EI001) that could induce apoptosis by
the mitochondrial pathway but not dependent on Ras/
Raf/MEK pathway in breast cancer cells. Based upon

further proteomics experiments, we found that EI001induced apoptosis was associated with some potential
ERK interactor involvements, such as HMGB1, BIRC6
and ATFM2 in breast cancer cells. In in vivo experiments,
we found that EI001 bear the anti-tumor activity without
any remarkable toxicity, and also induced apoptosis by
the mitochondrial pathway as well as affecting ERK
phosphorylation. Therefore, these results may provide a
clue for exploiting BL-EI001 as a potential novel smallmolecule drug in breast cancer therapeutics.

(http://www.zinc.docking.org/), respectively. Additionally,
we used DOCK6 to dock the pre-generated conformations
of drugs into ERK1/2 for virtually screening their inhibitors
[25]. We performed flexible-ligand docking to a rigid
receptor with grid-based scoring, in which the ligands
(drugs) were allowed to be flexible and structurally
rearranged in response to the receptor (ERK1/2).
Subsequently, we selected 11 small molecules to validate
their anti-proliferative activities. Moreover, MD stimulations
were performed with GROMACS (version 4.5.5) software
package to monitor the binding states between ERK1/2 and
the selected BL-EI001 [26].

ml. After 24 h incubation, they were treated with different
concentrations of E1-E11 and BL-EI001 for the indicated
time periods, respectively. Cell viability was measured by
the 3-(4, 5-dimetrylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay.

Two separate iTRAQ and MS/MS analysis were
performed in BL-EI001-treated MCF-7 and MDAMB231 cells. Briefly, cells were dissolved in lysis buffer
in presence of protease inhibitor (Sigma). The lysate
was centrifuged for 1 h at 15°C and the supernatant was
stored at −80°C for further use. Protein quantitation
was performed using RCDC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad).
iTRAQ labeling was carried out using iTRAQ Reagent
4-Plex kit (AB SCIEX) based on the manufacturer’s
protocol with minor modifications. A pair of HCT116Control and HCT116-CacyBP OE whole cell lysates
were labeled with iTRAQ labeling reagent 113 and 114
for the pair of control MCF-7 and BL-EI001-treated

Apoptosis assay
The MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well culture
plates with or without BL-EI001 and cultured for 24 h.
The ultrastructure of cell apoptosis was observed under
the electron microscope (Hitachi7000, Japan). For colony
formation assay, 150 counted cells were seeded in a 60
mm dish. The cells were continuously cultured in presence
or absence of indicated concentration of BL-EI001 for 14
days. Clones were stained with Giemsa and counted by
using a microscope. Only those cell clusters containing

MCF-7 whole cell lysate, respectively. Control MDAMB-231 and BL-EI001-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were
labeled with 114 and 115 iTRAQ labeling reagents,
respectively. After 2D LC analysis and tandem mass
spectrometry analysis, protein identification and relative
iTRAQ quantification were performed with ProteinPilot™
Software 4.2 (AB SCIEX) using the Paragon™ algorithm
for the peptide identification, which was further processed
by Pro GroupTM algorithm where isoform-specific
quantification was adopted to trace the differences between
expressions of various isoforms. Results with iTRAQ ratio
cutoff values of 1.2 and 0.8 for fold-change and number
cutoff values of 3 for quantifiable peptides for in protein
abundance were accepted.

counted in each field. Cells with Ki-67, caspase3, Bcl-2,
Bax and p-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity were considered
positive. For TUNEL assay, sections were permeabilized
with 0.1% Trition X-100 plus 0.1% sodium citrate and
then incubated with 50 μL TUNEL reaction mixture
(Roche) at 37°C for 60 min. After rinsing with PBS three
times, 50 μL converter-POD was added and the tissue
cells were incubated in a humidified chamber for 30 min
at 37°C. DAB substrate was then added, followed by
counterstaining with hematoxylin. The assay included
negative controls (without terminal transferase). Apoptosis
was quantified by counting the number of TUNELpositive cells in at least six non-overlapping high-power
fields on each section and evaluated.

Functional enrichment analyses

Statistical analysis

Differentially expressed proteins were assigned
to 14 functional synaptic protein groups. Enrichment
was only considered relevant when over represented
functional groups contained at least 5 proteins. In addition,
functional enrichment was determined using the DAVID
functional annotation tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).
The functional categories used were GO term related to
Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and
Molecular Function (MF), as well as pathway annotations
derived from KEGG. And, the apoptosis-related proteins
was detected and used as the background set.

All the presented data and results were confirmed
in at least three independent experiments. The data
are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons
were made by Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Mouse experiments and tumor xenograft model
Healthy female nude mice (BALB/c, 6–8 weeks
of age, non-fertile, 18–20 g of weight) were injected
subcutaneously with MCF-7 cells (1 × 107 cells/mouse).
When the tumors reached 100 mm3 in volume (calculated
as V = L × W2/2), mice were treated with either
hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (vehicle control) or BL-EI001
(low dose group: 15 mg/kg oral twice daily; median dose
group: 30 mg/kg oral twice daily; high dose group: 60 mg/
kg oral twice daily). Animals were sacrificed after 10 days.
Tumor tissues, were isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen
or fixed in formalin immediately.

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay

REFERENCES

Immunohistochemistry was performed. Briefly,
sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval
was performed by pretreatment of the slides in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 12 min. The
slides were incubated with PBS containing 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 15 min, PBS containing 5% BSA for 30 min,
and subsequently the primary antibody at 4°C overnight.
The slides were then probed with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 37°C, followed
by reaction with diaminobenzidine and counterstaining
with Mayer’s hematoxylin. To score each slide, at least
eight individual fields were chosen and 100 cells were
