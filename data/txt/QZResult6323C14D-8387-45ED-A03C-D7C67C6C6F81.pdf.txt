Abstract
Here, we used quantitative proteomics analysis to identify novel therapeutic
targets in cancer stem cells and/or progenitor cells. For this purpose, mammospheres
from two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) were grown in
suspension using low-attachment plates and directly compared to attached monolayer
cells grown in parallel. This allowed us to identify a subset of proteins that were
selectively over-expressed in mammospheres, relative to epithelial monolayers. We
focused on mitochondrial proteins, as they appeared to be highly upregulated in both
MCF7 and T47D mammospheres. Key mitochondrial-related enzymes involved in betaoxidation and ketone metabolism were significantly upregulated in mammospheres,
as well as proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, and specific protein inhibitors
of autophagy/mitophagy. Overall, we identified >40 “metabolic targets” that were
commonly upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D mammospheres. Most of these
“metabolic targets” were also transcriptionally upregulated in human breast cancer
cells in vivo, validating their clinical relevance. Based on this analysis, we propose that
increased mitochondrial biogenesis and decreased mitochondrial degradation could
provide a novel mechanism for the accumulation of mitochondrial mass in cancer stem
cells. To functionally validate our observations, we utilized a specific MCT1/2 inhibitor
(AR-C155858), which blocks the cellular uptake of two types of mitochondrial fuels,
namely ketone bodies and L-lactate. Our results indicate that inhibition of MCT1/2
function effectively reduces mammosphere formation, with an IC-50 of ~1 µM, in
both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Very similar results were
obtained with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Thus,
the proliferative clonal expansion of cancer stem cells appears to require oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism, related to the re-use of monocarboxylic acids, such as
ketones or L-lactate. Our findings have important clinical implications for exploiting
mitochondrial metabolism to eradicate cancer stem cells and to prevent recurrence,
metastasis and drug resistance in cancer patients. Importantly, a related MCT1/2
inhibitor (AZD3965) is currently in phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced
cancers: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01791595.

Introduction

understand tumor metabolism in the specific context of
“stemness”, to identify a metabolic “Achilles’ Heel” to
eradicate cancer stem cells. As such, our current findings
provide an unbiased systematic approach for identifying
new metabolic targets in cancer stem cells, using
quantitative proteomics analysis, and a strong rationale
for therapeutically targeting L-lactate, ketone bodies
and mitochondrial metabolism in the cancer stem cell
population.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), or tumor-initiating cells
(TICs), are thought to be resistant to conventional anticancer therapies, and have been implicated in treatment
failure, tumor recurrence and distant metastasis [1, 2].
Thus, residual treatment-resistant cancer stem cells are
believed to be responsible for poor clinical outcomes in
most cancer types [2-4]. Since CSCs are relatively rare
and elusive, very little is known about them, especially
regarding their physiology and metabolic phenotype.
Consistent with the idea that CSCs are resistant
to cellular stress, they are able to undergo anchorageindependent growth in low-attachment plates, allowing
the formation of 3D spheroids with the properties of
cancer stem cells and/or progenitor cells [5]. Under
these suspension conditions, most epithelial cancer cells
undergo a specialized form of cell death/apoptosis, termed
anoikis. Importantly, each of these 3D spheroids is formed
from the anchorage-independent clonal expansion of a
single cancer stem cell, and not from the self-aggregation
of existing cancer cells [5]. Therefore, the preparation of
3D spheroid cultures provides a functional assay to enrich
for a population of cells with an epithelial stem cell-like
phenotype. In this regard, the behavior of 3D spheroids
(also known as mammosphere cultures) prepared from
primary breast cancer cells or breast cancer epithelial cell
lines are the most well-characterized.
Here, we isolated large numbers of mammospheres
from two independent ER-positive breast cancer cell lines,
namely MCF7 and T47D cells, in an attempt to better
understand their phenotypic behavior at a molecular level.
The large-scale preparation of mammospheres allowed
us to then perform unbiased label-free proteomics
analysis, in an attempt to understand the proteome that
is characteristic of cancer stem cells. Interestingly, based
on this initial analysis, we noticed that mammospheres
dramatically overexpress mitochondrial-related proteins.
Thus, we focused on the mitochondrial proteins that
were upregulated, relative to cells cultured as epithelial
monolayers, in parallel. Based on this analysis, we
speculate that CSCs become resistant to stress by fortifying
their capacity to produce ATP by oxidative mitochondrial
metabolism. Treatment with the MCT1/2 inhibitor (ARC155858) validated that mammosphere formation is
dependent on the uptake of specific mitochondrial fuels,
such as L-lactate and ketone bodies.
Importantly, over the last several decades,
significant progress has been made in understanding the
critical role of cellular metabolism in tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis, including studies related to
ROS production, oxidative stress, glycolysis, glutamine
metabolism and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism
[6-13]. However, most of these studies have focused on
“bulk” cancer cells, but not on cancer stem cells or the
progenitor cell population. Thus, there is a great need to

Results
Proteomic analysis of MCF7 mammospheres
Monolayer and mammosphere cultures of
MCF7 cells, an ER-positive cell line, were subjected
to quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. Greater
than 500 proteins were found to be upregulated or
downregulated. For simplicity, we focused on the proteins
that were significantly upregulated in mammospheres,
relative to mononlayer cell cultures (p < 0.05).
Immediately, we noticed that several mitochondrial
proteins were highly upregulated in mammospheres, so
we restricted our analysis to mitochondrial proteins and
key related metabolic enzymes.
Table 1 shows a non-redundant list of 62
mitochondrial-related proteins that were selectively
upregulated in MCF7 mammospheres. Only proteins
with a fold increase of ~2 or greater were selected for
this analysis. Note that 9 mitochondrial proteins were
infinitely upregulated, as compared with monolayer
cultures. A functional analysis of this list revealed that 12
proteins were specifically related to beta-oxidation and
ketone metabolism/re-utilization (HSD17B10, BDH1,
ACAT1, ACADVL, ACACA, ACLY, HADHB, SUCLG2,
ACAD9, HADHA, ECHS1, ACADSB). Also, 8 proteins
involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were dramatically
upregulated (HSPA9, TIMM8A, GFM1, MRPL45,
MRPL17, HSPD1(HSP60), TSFM, TUFM). In addition,
many proteins related to electron transport (NDUFB10,
COX6B1, PMPCA, COX5B, SDHA, UQCRC1), ATP
synthesis (ATP5B, ATPIF1, ATP5A1, ATP5F1, ATP5H,
ATP5O), ADP/ATP exchange/transport (SLC25A5),
CoQ synthesis (COQ9), or ROS production (GPD2)
were also increased. Finally, two proteins involved in
the suppression of glycolysis, autophagy and mitophagy
were also significantly increased (SOGA1, LRPPRC).
Thus, increased mitochondrial biogenesis and decreased
mitochondrial degradation could provide a novel
mechanism for the overall accumulation of mitochondrial
mass in cancer stem cells.

15].

Figure 2 shows the effects of increasing
concentrations of AR-C155858 on mammosphere
formation, using an ER-positive cell line (MCF7).
Importantly, the MCT1/2 inhibitor AR-C155858
significantly reduces mammosphere formation, with an
IC-50 of ~ 1µM.
As breast cancer stem cells are thought to be ERnegative, we also evaluated the effects of AR-C155858
on an ER-negative cell line, namely MDA-MB-231 cells.
Figure 3 shows that the MCT1/2 inhibitor AR-C155858
also effectively reduces mammosphere formation in this
cellular context, with an IC-50 of ~ 1-2 µM. Therefore,
MCT1/2 inhibition may be a new general therapeutic
strategy that could be utilized to treat several different
epithelial subtypes of human breast cancers.
Thus, 3D spheroid cultures appear to require
oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, related to the re-use
of monocarboxylic acids (ketones or L-lactate), for the
proliferative anchorage-independent expansion of cancer
stem cells.

For comparison purposes, we also performed
unbiased label-free proteomic analysis on a second
independent ER-positive breast cancer cell line, namely
T47D cells.
Our results are summarized in Table 2. Note that
49 mitochondrial-related proteins were specifically
over-expressed in T47D mammospheres, as compared
with T47D monolayer cultures processed in parallel.
Remarkably, 41 of these proteins overlapped with the
proteins that were upregulated in MCF7 mammospheres
(41/49 = 84% overlap). See the Venn diagram presented
in Figure 1. Therefore, many of the same biological
processes would be expected to be activated or enhanced.
Thus, beta-oxidation, ketone re-utilization, mitochondrial
biogenesis, and ROS production, with decreased
mitochondrial degradation and reduced autophagy, are
likely to be key biological features of both MCF7 and
T47D mammospheres. Interestingly, CHCHD2 and CPOX
were infinitely upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D data
sets.

Functional effects of inhibition of the
mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V) on
mammosphere formation

Functional effects of MCT1/2 inhibition on
mammosphere formation

Finally, to further validate that mammosphere
formation is strictly dependent on oxidative mitochondrial
metabolism, we used a well-established investigational
compound that potently inhibits the mitochondrial
ATP synthase (complex V), namely oligomycin A.
Importantly, five protein components of the mitochondrial
ATP synthesis were highly up-regulated in MCF7
mammospheres (ATP5B, ATP5A1, ATP5F1, ATP5H,
ATP5O).

Next, to functionally validate the hypothesis that
mammosphere formation may require ketone re-utilization
and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, we used a
highly specific inhibitor (AR-C155858) of the relevant
monocarboxylate transporters, namely MCT1/2 [14, 15].
MCT1/2 normally function as specific transporters for
the uptake of ketone and L-lactate [16]. AR-C155858
effectively inhibits MCT1/2 function, and blocks the
cellular uptake of both ketone bodies and L-lactate [14,

Figure 4A,B shows the effects of increasing
concentrations of oligomycin A on mammosphere
formation. Note that oligomycin A significantly reduces
mammosphere formation in MCF7 cells, with an IC-50
of ~ 100 nM. Oligomycin A also significantly inhibited
mammosphere formation in MDA-MB-231 cells, but
with less potency, with an IC-50 between 5-10 µM. As
such, oligomycin A was 50-100 times less potent in MDAMB-231 cells, as compared with MCF7 mammospheres.
Therefore, MCT1/2 inhibition may be a more
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effective strategy for eradicating cancer stem cells in
multiple breast cancer types, rather than targeting the
mitochondrial ATP synthase.

Clinical relevance of mitochondrial targets in
human breast cancers
To determine the potential clinical relevance of
our findings, we next assessed whether the “metabolic
targets” that we identified in mammospheres were also
11033

transcriptionally upregulated in human breast cancer cells
in vivo.
For this purpose, we employed a published clinical
data set of N=28 breast cancer patients in which their
tumor samples were subjected to laser-capture microdissection, to physically separate epithelial cancer cells
from their adjacent tumor stroma [17]. Table 3 presents a
summary of these findings. Overall, 39 of the “metabolic
targets” that we identified in mammospheres (Tables
1 & 2) were also transcriptionally elevated in human
breast cancer cells in vivo (Table 3) and the majority of
these targets were upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D
mammospheres (21 out of 39, ~54% ).
In light of these findings, the new “metabolic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targets” that we identified in mammospheres are especially
clinically relevant, for improving both the diagnosis and
treatment of human breast cancers.

Discussion
Previous immuno-histochemical studies have
shown that markers of cell proliferation (Ki67) and
mitochondrial mass/function (TOMM20 and Complex
IV activity) specifically co-localize to the basal stem cell
layer in human oral mucosal tissue [18]. Interestingly, in
this context, MCT1 was the most specific marker of the
basal stem cell layer, suggesting that normal stem cells
may use L-lactate and ketone bodies to fuel oxidative

mitochondrial metabolism and stem cell proliferation
[18]. Similarly, Ki67, mitochondrial markers and MCT1
also co-localized in aggressive head and neck tumor cells,
consistent with the idea that amplification of mitochondrial
metabolism may contribute to human tumor formation and
cancer progression [18].
Numerous studies have also implicated ketone
bodies and L-lactate metabolism in cancer biology and/or
“stemness” in cancer cells. For example, treatment with
mitochondrial fuels (such as L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) is sufficient to stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis in MCF7 cells and dramatically increases
the levels of gene transcripts normally expressed in
embryonic, neuronal and hematopoietic stem cells [19].
Importantly, the transcriptional profiles of lactate- or
ketone-treated MCF7 cells effectively predicted poor
clinical outcome (tumor recurrence and metastasis) in
ER-positive breast cancer patients [19]. Consistent with
these findings, Cuyas et al. recently showed that cancer
stem cells created by silencing of E-cadherin expression
prefer to use L-lactate and ketone bodies as mitochondrial
fuels [20].
Here, using unbiased label-free proteomics
analysis, we show that mammospheres (a population
of cells enriched in cancer stem cells and progenitor
cells) functionally overexpress numerous mitochondrial
proteins, related to mitochondrial biogenesis, electron
transport, OXPHOS, ATP synthesis, as well as betaoxidation and ketone re-utilization. The potential clinical
relevance of these targets was further validated using a
previously published data set of human breast cancer
samples (N=28 patients), that were subjected to lasercapture microdissection, to separate the epithelial tumor
cells from the adjacent tumor stroma [17]. Thus, these
novel mitochondrial-based targets may reveal a metabolic
“Achilles’ Heel” to allow the eradication of cancer stem

cells.

In accordance with this idea, we demonstrate that
therapeutic targeting of MCT1/2 in cancer stem cells may
be a viable strategy, via inhibiting the uptake of necessary
key mitochondrial fuels (ketone bodies and L-lactate),
that may be required for anchorage-independent growth,
as well as cancer stem cell proliferative expansion
and survival. Further validation was also provided by
experiments with oligomycin A, a well-established
inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V).
Interestingly, here we observed that the
mitochondrial protein CHCHD2 was infinitely upregulated
in both MCF7 and T47D mammospheres (Tables 1 and 2),
and was also the most highly transcriptionally upregulated
protein in the context of human breast cancer cells in vivo
(Table 3). Thus, future studies may be warranted on the
specific role of CHCHD2 in cancer stem cell metabolism.
Currently, very little is known about CHCHD2. However,
CHCHD2 has been previously implicated functionally
in the response to hypoxia and in the transcriptional
upregulation of members of the OXPHOS complexes, as
well as a positive regulator of cell migration [21-23].
In conclusion, based on our quantitative proteomics
analysis and functional validation studies using

Materials and Methods

Data Mining
To firmly establish the clinical relevance of our
results from the quantitative proteomics analysis of
mammosheres, we re-analyzed the transcriptional profiles
of epithelial breast cancer cells and adjacent tumor stromal
cells that were physically separated by laser-capture
microdissection (from N=28 human breast cancer patients)
[17].

Materials
Breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D and MDAMB-231 cells) were purchased from the ATCC. ARC155858 was obtained commercially from MedChem
Express (UK). Gibco-brand cell culture media (DMEM/
F12) was purchased from Life Technologies. Oligomycin
A was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

A single cell suspension was prepared using
enzymatic (1x Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924),
and manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create a
single cell suspension [5]. Cells were plated at a density
of 500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium (DMEM-F12/
B27/20ng/ml EGF/PenStrep) in non-adherent conditions,
in culture dishes coated with (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)
(poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932). Cells were grown for 5
days and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C at
an atmospheric pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/air.
After 5 days for culture, spheres >50 µm were counted
using an eye piece graticule, and the percentage of cells
plated which formed spheres was calculated and is
referred to as percentage mammosphere formation, and
was normalized to one (1 = 100 %MSF). For proteomic
analysis, mammospheres were collected by centrifugation
at 800 rpm for 10 minutes.
