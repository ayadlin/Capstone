Abstract
D- and E-type cyclins mediate G1-S phase cell cycle progression through activation of specific cyclin-dependent kinases
(cdk) that phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRb),
thereby alleviating repression of E2F-DP transactivation of
S-phase genes. Cyclin D1 is often overexpressed in a variety of
cancers and is associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis.
Loss of cyclin D can cause G1 arrest in some cells, but in other
cellular contexts, the downstream cyclin E protein can
substitute for cyclin D and facilitate G1-S progression. The
objective of this study was to determine if a flexible
heteroarotinoid anticancer compound, SHetA2, regulates cell
cycle proteins and cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer
cells. SHetA2 induced cyclin D1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation, causing G1 arrest in
ovarian cancer cells despite continued cyclin E2 expression
and independently of p53 and glycogen synthase kinase-3B.
Cyclin D1 loss inhibited pRb S780 phosphorylation by cyclin
D1-cdk4/6 and released p21 from cyclin D1-cdk4/6-p21
protein complexes to form cyclin E2-cdk2-p21 complexes,
which repressed phosphorylation of pRb S612 by cyclin E2cdk2 and ultimately E2F-DP transcriptional activity. G1 arrest
was prevented by overexpression or preventing degradation of
cyclin D1 but not by restoration of pRb S612 phosphorylation
through p21 knockdown. In conclusion, we show that loss of
cyclin D1 in ovarian cancer cells treated with SHetA2 is
sufficient to induce G1 cell cycle arrest and this strategy is not
impeded by the presence of cyclin E2. Therefore, cyclin D1 is a
sufficient therapeutic target in ovarian cancer cells. [Cancer

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecologic malignancies
with more than 70% of cases diagnosed at an advanced stage that
has only a 30% average 5-year survival rate. Unlike other cancers,
the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer etiology are
poorly understood, mainly due to difficulties in detecting and
obtaining early-stage ovarian cancer lesions for study (1–3). Thus,
there is a great need for low-toxicity drugs that can prevent and
treat ovarian cancer.

All cancers are characterized by abnormalities in apoptosis and
differentiation and altered cell proliferation (4). Cancer cells often
have a selective growth advantage due to deregulation of cell cycle
proteins, causing aberrant growth signaling that drives tumor
development (1, 5). Exit of cells from quiescence and cell cycle
progression is induced by sequential activation of cyclin-dependent
kinases (cdk) by cyclins. Once the cell progresses through late G1
into the S phase, it is irrevocably committed to DNA replication
and cell division (6). Deregulation of G1 to S-phase transition is
implicated in the pathogenesis of most human cancers, including
ovarian cancer (7). D- and E-type cyclins act as positive regulators
of this critical transition. Cyclin D expression is the converging
point at which diverse mitogenic and transformation signaling
cascades integrate to mediate engagement of the cell cycle
machinery (8). Three cyclin D isoforms (D1, D2, and D3) are
differentially expressed in various tissues (9). Of these, cyclin D1
overexpression is most frequently associated with human cancer
(10). Cyclin D1 is rarely mutated, but its overexpression confers a
selective growth advantage and hence acts as a driver of neoplastic
growth in various cancers (11). In epithelial ovarian cancer,
overexpression of cyclin D1 has been associated with decreased
survival in patients (12). An estimated 26% of sporadic epithelial
ovarian cancers overexpress cyclin D1 (13). Proteasomal degradation has emerged as an important regulator of cyclin D1 levels in
cancer cells (14). In addition to cyclin D, both human E-type cyclins
(E/E1 and E2) are also involved in G1- to S-phase progression and
in some cases can compensate for cyclin D knockout (15–17).
Overexpression of either E-type cyclin has been associated with cell
proliferation and metastasis (18). The activities of both G1 cyclins
D and E converge on the retinoblastoma protein (pRb).
Unphosphorylated pRb binds to E2F-DP transcription factor
heterodimers, thus masking their transactivation domain (6). In
this state, pRb also recruits histone deacetylases (HDAC), SWI/SNF,
and histone methylases, which all serve to maintain the repressed
state of chromatin located at E2F-responsive genes required for cell
cycle progression (6, 19). In healthy cells, increased cyclin D levels
in response to mitogenic stimuli lead to formation of active cyclin
D-cdk4/6 complexes that hypophosphorylate pRb and disrupt its
association with HDAC at E2F-DP binding sites. This results in
partial activation of E2F-DP, allowing transcription from the cyclin
E promoter only. Ongoing pRb-SWI/SNF interactions on other E2FDP promoters maintains E2F-DP in the repressed state (20). The
newly synthesized cyclin E binds and activates cdk2, causing
further pRb hyperphosphorylation resulting in additional weakening of pRb affinity for E2F-DP. The released E2F-DP transcription
factor complex is now free to drive transcription of S-phase genes,
hence facilitating cell cycle progression (6, 20). Disruption of the
pRb pathway in cancer is not surprising given its complex control
of cell cycle progression (21).

Flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Het) are small molecules that
offer promise in ovarian cancer because they induce differentiation,
apoptosis, and growth inhibition without evidence of toxicity
(22–27). The lead Flex-Het, SHetA2, is currently in preclinical
development and was chosen because it exhibited the greatest
efficacy in inducing apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines without
killing the normal cells. The mechanism of this differential
apoptosis occurs through direct effects on mitochondria and Bcl2 family proteins (22, 24). Because apoptosis and the cell cycle are
closely coupled, most compounds that are cytotoxic are also

cytostatic (28). The objective of this study was to determine if
alterations in cell cycle proteins and cell cycle progression
contribute to the mechanism of growth inhibition induced by
SHetA2 in ovarian cancer cell lines.
In this study, we report that targeting cyclin D1 for proteasomal
degradation is sufficient to induce G1 cell cycle arrest in ovarian
cancer cell lines. The downstream consequences on pRb phosphorylation, E2F activity, and cyclin A expression could not be
compensated for by continued expression of endogenous cyclin E2
or by relief of p21 repression of cyclin E2-cdk2 activity in ovarian

cancer cell lines. Thus, cyclin D1 is a sufficient target for inducing
G1 arrest of ovarian cancer cells in chemoprevention and
therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Ovarian cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and Caov-3 (American Type
Culture Collection) were maintained in McCoy’s 5A and DMEM (with
L-glutamine) media, respectively. A2780 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
with L-glutamine (supplemented with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and
1 mmol/L HEPES buffer). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and antibiotic/antimycotic. SHetA2 was synthesized by
K. Darrell Berlin (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; ref. 25), dissolved
in DMSO, and manipulated under reduced lighting conditions. All cells were
treated for 24 h with 5 Amol/L SHetA2 or DMSO unless stated otherwise.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were seeded onto six-well plates (5  105 per
well). After treatment, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol and
stored overnight at 4jC. For analysis, 1 mL of freshly prepared PBS staining
solution [200 Ag/mL RNase A, 20 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI), and 0.1%
Triton X-100] was added to the cells. DNA content was analyzed the same
day by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur from Becton Dickinson). ModFit Cell
Cycle Analysis software was used to determine the cell cycle phase.
Total cell number determination and apoptosis assay. Cells were
plated in six-well plates (5  105 per well) overnight before treatment. After
treatment, the medium and PBS used to wash the cells were harvested to
collect any detached cells and pooled with attached cells that were collected

after trypsinization. The total number of cells was determined with a
Beckman Coulter counter.
For the apoptosis assay, cells were pelleted and resuspended in Annexin
V-FITC-PI stain (100 AL Annexin binding buffer, 5 AL Annexin V-FITC
conjugate, and 2 AL of 100 Ag/mL PI; Invitrogen) for 10 min at room
temperature. An additional 400 AL of the Annexin binding buffer was then
added and the samples were run through a FACSCalibur. Summit for MoFlo
Acquisition and Sort Control Software (Cytomation, Inc.) were used to
quantify apoptosis.
Transient expression of cyclin D1. Cells were transfected with 5 Ag
human pcDNA3 cyclin D1 T286 mutant (Mt) and pcDNA3 cyclin D1 wildtype (Wt) using Metafectene Pro transfection reagent (Biontex) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Osamu
Tetsu (University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) and were
previously described (29). After 24 h, the cells were replated and cultured for
a further 24 h before treatment.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells transfected with 10 Ag Wt cyclin D1 were
treated with 5 Amol/L SHetA2 for 8 h in the presence of 10 Amol/L MG132,
a proteasomal degradation inhibitor. Protein extracts (200 Ag) were
immunoprecipitated with 8 Ag of cyclin D1 or p21 antibody using
Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
with the addition of a 1-h Dynabead preclearance step to reduce nonspecific
binding.
Western blotting. For whole-cell extraction, cells were lysed with M-PER
mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted

E2F luciferase reporter assay. Cultures were transfected with 5 Ag
pTA-E2F-luc and pTA-luc plasmids (Clontech) using Metafectene Pro as
described earlier. The next day, cells were replated and incubated overnight.
Cultures were then treated for 24 h and luciferase activity was determined
using a luciferase assay (Promega). Each luciferase value was normalized to
the protein concentration and then to the control sample transfected with
pTA-luc and treated with DMSO solvent.
Statistics. Results shown are representative of at least two independent
experiments performed in triplicate. The data are presented as the mean F
SE. The Student’s independent t test was used to determine the statistical
significance between the G1-phase cells in the DMSO control and SHetA2
treatment group. For cyclin D1 overexpression, one-way ANOVA was used
to analyze the statistical significance of the percentage of cells in the G1
phase after SHetA2 treatment followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
In each case, P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01 (**), and P < 0.001 (***).

determined by the Bicinchoninic Acid kit (Pierce) to ensure equal loading.
Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as previously described (24). Blots
were incubated with the following antibodies: cyclin D1 (BD Pharmingen);
S9 phospho–glycogen synthase kinase-3h (GSK-3h), GSK-3h, T286 phospho–cyclin D1, cyclin A, p21, p42 phospho-pRb (S780, S795), and total pRb

antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
RNA interference. Cells were transfected with human-specific p21 small
interfering RNA (siRNA) SignalSilence p21Waf1/Cip1 siRNA kit (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Then, 48 h after transfection, the cultures were treated with
either DMSO or 5 Amol/L SHetA2 for 24 h. Western blots of protein extracts
from these cultures were probed with anti-p21 and anti-p42 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) antibodies (provided with kit to confirm
knockout specificity).

SHetA2 induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and cyclin D1 loss
independent of p53 and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. The
effects of SHetA2 on cell cycle profiles were measured by flow
cytometric analysis of three ovarian cancer cell lines that differed
by p53 status and origin. A2780, established from an ovarian
adenocarcinoma of an untreated patient, expresses Wt p53 (30);
SK-OV-3, established from the ascitic fluid of an ovarian cancer
patient, has a p53 gene deletion and does not express any p53
mRNA or protein (30); whereas Caov-3, established from an ovarian
adenocarcinoma, expresses Mt p53 (31). Despite these differences,
all three ovarian cancer cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent
increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle
(Fig. 1A for A2780 and SK-OV-3; data not shown for Caov-3),
indicating that p53 is not required for the mechanism of G1 arrest.
Maximal G1 arrest was induced by 5 Amol/L SHetA2, and this
concentration was used to treat cells in subsequent experiments.
G1 arrest increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). A2780
cells responded more rapidly to SHetA2, exhibiting statistically
significant G1 arrest after 4 hours (P = 0.0257). Both SK-OV-3 and
A2780 cells exhibited significant G1-phase arrest at 16 hours
(A2780, P = 0.000712; SK-OV-3, P = 0.00409) and at 24 hours (A2780,
P = 0.000346; SK-OV-3, P = 0.00759). This G1 arrest was associated
with both a time- and dose-dependent decrease of cyclin D1
protein (Fig. 1B) in SHetA2-treated cultures compared with
untreated controls.
Flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with Annexin V and PI
was performed to determine if apoptosis was occurring at the
5 Amol/L dose and 24-hour time point that induced maximal G1
arrest. Although this treatment induced a statistically significant
reduction in total cell number of cells (A2780, P = 0.0157; SK-OV-3,
P = 0.0378; Fig. 1C, left), there was no significant increase in the
number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1C, right).
The mechanism of cyclin D1 loss involves T286 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation independent of GSK-3B. Cyclin D1 levels are frequently up-regulated in
cancer and this may be partly due to deregulated proteasomal
degradation (32). Western blot analysis of enriched nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts showed that SHetA2 induced phosphorylation
of cyclin D1 on T286, which is known to target this protein for
ubiquitination (10). This occurred in a time-dependent manner
in both fractions with a concomitant decrease in total cyclin D1
(Fig. 2A; results for nuclear extracts not shown). Subsequent
increases in cyclin D1 ubiquitination were confirmed after 8 hours
of SHetA2 treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). An inhibitor of

proteasomal degradation, MG132, was used to test if SHetA2induced cyclin D1 loss and G1 arrest are due to enhanced
proteasomal degradation. Treatment with SHetA2 in the presence
of MG132 totally abrogated the G1 arrest observed in the presence
of SHetA2 alone (Fig. 2C). MG132 also partially restored the cyclin
D1 in SHetA2-treated extracts (Supplementary Fig. S1A) to levels
comparable with treatment with MG132 alone, implicating cyclin
D1 degradation in the mechanism of G1 arrest. Simultaneous
treatment with LiCl and SB216763 to inhibit GSK-3h, a kinase
known to phosphorylate cyclin D1 at T286 (32, 33), did not prevent
SHetA2-induced cyclin D1 degradation (Supplementary Fig. S1B) or
G1 arrest (Fig. 2D), suggesting that GSK-3h does not mediate the

SHetA2-induced cyclin D1 phosphorylation and subsequent events.
In contrast, Western blot analysis of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts showed that SHetA2 induced phosphorylation of GSK-3h
at S9, which inhibits its kinase activity (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Cyclin D1 overexpression attenuated SHetA2-induced G1
arrest. To directly test the role of cyclin D1 in the mechanism of
SHetA2-induced G1 arrest, the effects of expression of Wt and
T286A, a degradation-resistant Mt, of cyclin D1 on SHetA2 G1 arrest
were evaluated. Transfection with either Wt or Mt cyclin D1 caused
partial reversal of G1 loss after SHetA2 treatment in comparison
with mock-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 3A). Western blots verified
the transfection and cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 3B). The lack of

complete abrogation of G1 arrest is likely due to low transfection
efficiencies in these cell lines. A similar trend was seen in SK-OV-3
cells, although G1 attenuation was less than in the A2780 cells
(Fig. 3A). When the percentage of A2780 cells in G1 was compared
by one-way ANOVA, the P value was <0.00001, and Tukey’s multiple
comparison test for each set of pairs gave the following values:
mock versus Wt, P < 0.05; mock versus Mt, P < 0.001; and Wt versus
Mt, P < 0.01. In SK-OV-3, the ANOVA P value was <0.001, and for
pairwise comparisons, the ANOVA P value was as follows: mock
versus Wt, P < 0.05; mock versus Mt, P < 0.001; and Wt versus Mt,
P > 0.05. In A2780 cells when compared with the mock-transfected
cells, there was greater G1 arrest attenuation in the degradationresistant cyclin D1 Mt–transfected cells when compared with Wt
cyclin D1–transfected cells after treatment with SHetA2. This
further supports the role of proteasomal degradation in the
SHetA2-induced mechanism.
SHetA2 alters cyclin E2 levels and p21 interactions. The
effects of SHetA2 on the expression and interaction of additional
G1 phase cell regulatory molecules that have been implicated in
ovarian cancer, cyclin E2 and p21 (1), were evaluated. Both cyclin
E2 and p21 proteins were elevated at the 24-hour SHetA2 treatment
time point at protein level (Fig. 4A). Cyclin E2 mRNA levels were
also elevated after treatment with SHetA2 in all three ovarian
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both cyclin D1 and cyclin
E2 coimmunoprecipitated with p21 in the untreated control cells
(Fig. 4B). In SHetA2-treated cells, cyclin D1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with p21, which was expected because cyclin D1 protein
is absent at this treatment time point as shown earlier (Fig. 1B). In
addition, greater amounts of cyclin E2 coimmunoprecipitated with
p21 in treated cells compared with the untreated control.
p21 siRNA restores pRb S612 phosphorylation but not G1-S
progression. Both cyclin D1–stimulated and cyclin E2–stimulated
cdk activity converges on hyperphosphorylation of pRb; hence, the
effect of SHetA2 on the phosphorylation status of pRb was
investigated by Western blot (Fig. 4C). SHetA2 caused a reduction
in pRb phosphorylation at S780 and S612 but not S795. Because p21
complexed with both cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 in our studies, p21
was predicted to be involved in the mechanism of SHetA2mediated G1 arrest. Specific siRNA knockdown of p21 did not affect
SHetA2-induced G1 arrest in either cell line (Fig. 4D). Knockdown
of p21 in SHetA2-treated cells did not prevent SHetA2-mediated
loss of phosphorylation of pRb S780 but did partially restore pRb
S612 phosphorylation, a site phosphorylated by cyclin E2-cdk2
(Fig. 4D, bottom; ref. 34).
SHetA2 inhibits E2F transactivation and cyclin A expression.
Decreased phosphorylation of pRb has been shown to inhibit
uncoupling of E2F-DP from pRb and to repress E2F transactivation
(20). To test this, the effects of SHetA2 on luciferase activity were
measured in ovarian cancer cell lines cotransfected with a
luciferase reporter construct driven by E2F DNA binding sites.
SHetA2 inhibited E2F promoter activity f3-fold (Fig. 5A). To verify
that the observed decrease in E2F promoter activity altered
expression of E2F target genes, the effects of SHetA2 on
endogenous cyclin A levels were determined using Western blot.
As expected, cyclin A levels were decreased in SHetA2-treated cells
in comparison with control (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
The results of this study show that cyclin D1 plays a dominant
role in regulating cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer cells and

that degradation of cyclin D1 through treatment with SHetA2 is
sufficient to induce G1 cell cycle arrest. This conclusion is supported
by the demonstration that G1 arrest can be inhibited by overriding
the cyclin D1 loss through overexpression of Wt or a nondegradable
Mt of cyclin D1 or by inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Whereas
cyclin E has been shown to compensate for knockout of cyclin D
during fetal development and in other studies (15–17), our studies
show that cyclin E2 expression is insufficient to facilitate G1 to S
progression in the absence of cyclin D1. Under normal conditions,
expression of cyclin E is controlled by cyclin D through activation of
cdk4/6 hypophosphorylation of pRb (Fig. 6), causing the partial
release of E2F-DP at the cyclin E promoter from repression by pRb
and HDAC (6, 9, 20). In SHetA2-treated ovarian cancer cell lines,
however, cyclin E2 continued to be expressed at the 24-hour time
point despite complete loss of cyclin D1 at an earlier (8 hours)
treatment time point. This suggests that in the ovarian cancer cells
studied, cyclin E2 expression may be independent of cyclin D1.
Although both cyclin E2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in
SHetA2-treated cultures, it cannot be concluded that the effect is a
direct effect of SHetA2 on transcription because the increased cyclin
E2 levels could be due to the higher percentage of G1-phase cells in
the SHetA2-treated cultures that may have contained cyclin E2
protein before treatment.
The inability of cyclin E2 to compensate for cyclin D1 loss can be
explained by the molecular events that occur downstream of cyclin

Cyclin E2 Does Not Compensate for Cyclin D1 Loss

D1 loss in ovarian cancer cells. The SHetA2-induced decrease in
phosphorylation of pRb at S780 is consistent with cyclin D1 loss
and the report that this site is exclusively phosphorylated by cyclin
D-cdk4/6 (34). Decreased phosphorylation of pRb on the S612 site
reported to be exclusively phosphorylated by cyclin E-cdk2,
however, is not consistent with the continued expression of cyclin
E2 observed after SHetA2 treatment (34) but can be explained by
p21 repression of cdk2 kinase activity. There has been controversy
over the role of p21 in cdk4/6 inhibition; however, the general
consensus is that p21 is a positive regulator of cdk4/6 but inhibits
cdk2 when complexed with either cyclin E or cyclin A (20, 35, 36).
In this study, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that p21
binds both cyclin D1 and cyclin E2. As cyclin D1 is lost in SHetA2treated cells, and cyclin E2 levels are increased, the increased cyclin
E2 is bound by p21 protein (Fig. 6). Repression of cdk2 activity by
p21 has been previously reported (35, 36) and is consistent with the
ability of p21 siRNA to partially reverse the reduction in pRb S612
phosphorylation caused by SHetA2-induced transfer of p21 from
cyclin D1 to cyclin E2. Thus, in untreated ovarian cancer cells,
cyclin D1 facilitates cdk2 activity by titrating p21 from cyclin
E2-cdk2. In SHetA2-treated cells, increased levels of cyclin E2 are
bound and inhibited by increased levels of total p21 and may be
supplemented with p21 released from degraded cyclin D1
complexes.
The inability of p21 siRNA to attenuate SHetA2-induced G1
arrest further exemplifies the dominant role of cyclin D1 activity
over cyclin E2 activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. As anticipated,
p21 siRNA released repression of cyclin E2-cdk2 activity and
allowed pRb S612 phosphorylation, but due to the absence of cyclin
D1 in SHetA2-treated cells, pRb S780, a cyclin D-cdk4/6
phosphorylation site, remained unphosphorylated in the presence
of p21 siRNA. Thus, pRb S612 phosphorylation by cyclin E2-cdk2 is
insufficient to overcome loss of cyclin D1 and the resulting
reduction of pRb S780 phosphorylation. This dominant role of
cyclin D1-cdk4 over cyclin E2-cdk2 in driving cell cycle progression
indicates that cyclin D1 is a relevant target for the development of
drugs for ovarian cancer.

The SHetA2-induced reduction in pRb S612 and S795 phosphorylation was expected to inhibit release of E2F from pRb. The
consequence of decreased release of E2F was confirmed by the
observed reduction in E2F transactivation activity and transcription of an E2F endogenous gene, cyclin A. Cyclin A regulates
S-phase progression and mitosis because it binds to and activates
both cdk2 and cdk1 (37). Thus, the downstream mechanism of
SHetA2-induced G1 arrest through cyclin D1 degradation involves
both decreased expression of cyclin A and release of p21, which
serves to repress cdk2 activity (Fig. 6).
GSK-3h was the first kinase shown to phosphorylate cyclin D1,
thus targeting it for nuclear export by CRM1, ubiquitination, and
proteasomal degradation (33). In the ovarian cell lines used in this
study, however, cyclin D1 T286 phosphorylation and degradation is
independent of GSK-3h because two separate GSK-3h inhibitors
failed to abrogate cyclin D1 degradation. Instead, SHetA2 induced
phosphorylation of GSK-3h at S9, an event known to inhibit the
kinase activity (33, 38). These observations suggest the existence of
another redundant kinase for which cyclin D1 (T286) acts as a
substrate.
The ability to inhibit the deregulated cell cycle progression of
ovarian cancer cell lines through a specific molecular mechanism
supports the application of SHetA2 in ovarian cancer chemoprevention. SHetA2 offers promise in this regard in that it has not
exhibited toxicities in multiple animal models, including models of
ovarian cancer xenograft growth, skin irritancy, and teratogenicity
(22, 26, 27). Further evidence for SHetA2 chemoprevention activity
includes the reversal of carcinogen-induced transformation in an
in vitro organotypic model and in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis
and xenograft growth (23, 27). The demonstration in this study that
SHetA2 induces G1 arrest in all cell lines tested regardless of the
status of p53 suggests that it will be effective against a broad
spectrum of tumor types, including tumors that have lost p53
function. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is the most commonly
mutated gene in all cancers. The efficacy of SHetA2 is not limited
to ovarian cancer because it can inhibit growth of a wide variety of
cancers (22).

Figure 6. Model. In normal cells,
mitogenic stimuli induce cyclin D
expression. Cyclin D binds to cdk4/6,
forming a complex, and titrates p21
from the cell, facilitating pRb
hypophosphorylation. This results in
partial derepression of the E2F
transcription factor, allowing expression
of cyclin E. Cyclin E forms a complex
with and activates cdk2, which further
hyperphosphorylates pRb, resulting in total
derepression of the E2F promoter. This
allows transcription of S-phase genes that
are under the control of the E2F promoter.
In cancer cells, there is aberrant cyclin D1
and cyclin E2 expression. When SHetA2 is
added to the cells, cyclin D1 is lost through
proteasomal degradation. This loss results
in recruitment of p21 to cyclin E2-cdk2
complexes, inhibiting cdk2 activity. This
prevents pRb hyperphosphorylation and
the E2F promoters remain repressed by
the bound pRb complex, resulting in G1
arrest and inhibition of cyclin A expression.

Cancer Research

In summary, this study shows that cyclin D1 is a dominant
regulatory protein of cell cycle progression and a potential
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic target of ovarian cancer.
Hence, the low-toxicity SHetA2 compound shows promise as a
chemoprevention agent for ovarian cancer and other types of
cancers. This is significant because several molecules that inhibit
cyclin D1 or the cognate kinase cdk4/6 are in clinical development
and agents that down-regulated cyclin D1 resulted in positive
outcomes (39–41). In addition, cyclin D1 seems to be clinically
predictive of cancer risk (39), suggesting that cyclin D1 levels can
be used as an end point biomarker for both chemoprevention and
chemotherapy. Whereas cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation is the
primary biochemical end point of SHetA2-induced G1 arrest,
increased cyclin E2 and p21 levels, alterations in cyclin D1-cdk4/6p21 and cyclin E2-cdk2-p21 protein complexes, decreases in pRb
S780 and S612 phosphorylation, and decreased expression of cyclin

A are secondary biochemical end points. Some of these
downstream effects of SHetA2 may be useful surrogate biomarkers
of treatment responsiveness and efficacy before clinical evidence of
treatment response.
