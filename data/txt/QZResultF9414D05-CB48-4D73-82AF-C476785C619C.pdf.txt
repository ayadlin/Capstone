Abstract
The Wnt signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer due to mutations in genes encoding APC,
β-catenin, and axin. To identify small-molecule inhibitors of Wnt signaling as potential therapeutics, a diverse
chemical library was screened using a transcription factor reporter cell line in which the activity of the pathway was induced at the level of Disheveled protein. A series of deconvolution studies was used to focus on
three compound series that selectively killed cancer cell lines with constitutive Wnt signaling. Activities of the
compounds included the ability to induce degradation of β-catenin that had been stabilized by a glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor. This screen illustrates a practical approach to identify small-molecule
inhibitors of Wnt signaling that can seed the development of agents suitable to treat patients with Wntdependent tumors. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5963–73. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The Wnt signaling pathway is activated by Wnt ligands at
multiple stages of metazoan development and controls the
differentiation and/or proliferation of stem cells in multiple
tissues. The “canonical” Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated
following Wnt ligand binding to a complex comprising
Frizzled (Fz) and LRP5/6 receptors and ultimately activates
β-catenin/transcription factor–dependent transcription
(Fig. 1A). Key steps in the pathway include the formation of
a ligand-activated receptor complex, the inhibition of intracellular β-catenin turnover, and the formation of a nuclear
β-catenin/transcription factor (TCF) transcription complex.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling activates (and represses) transcription of genes whose promoters contain binding sites for TCFtranscription factors. Target genes include key developmental
and oncogenic targets (reviewed in ref. 1).
The Wnt signaling pathway is considered a key therapeutic
target for cancer (1). Mutations to “core” Wnt signaling components, including β-catenin, adenomatous polyposis coli

(APC), and Axin, inappropriately activate the β-catenin/
TCF branch of the Wnt signaling pathway in cancers arising
in a number of tissues, including colon and liver. Many other
cancers show evidence of inappropriate Wnt pathway activation, including raised levels of β-catenin (2). Unfortunately,
the known intracellular components of the core Wnt pathway are not good targets for small-molecule inhibitors, as
many interactions comprise extended protein-protein interfaces. Furthermore, drugs that target core components may
induce side effects because the function of key components
(e.g., β-catenin) is required for tissue homeostasis in multiple
organs, including the immune system and intestine (3).
Small molecules that target “noncore” Wnt signaling
components have recently been identified (4). Of particular
note, ICG001 blocks the interaction between β-catenin
and the noncore CREB binding protein (CBP) leading to a
reduction of adenoma formation in mouse models of colon
cancer (5). The β-catenin–CBP interaction was shown to
promote stem/progenitor marker expression, whereas the related β-catenin–p300 interaction, which was not subject to
blockade by ICG001, promoted expression of genes involved
in proliferative responses such as CMYC (6). The key point
from this example is that compounds that target noncore
components may be able to regulate distinct subsets of therapeutically relevant transcriptional targets. The recently discovered small molecules XAV939 and IWR2 inhibit Wnt
signaling by blocking tankyrase activity, which is required
for degradation of the β-catenin scaffold protein Axin (3, 7).
One of the main challenges in targeting noncore Wnt signaling molecules is knowing which protein to target. A large
number of potential target genes that regulate Wnt/β-catenin
signaling have been identified in whole-genome RNAi screens,
mass spectrometry, and yeast two-hybrid studies (8–10), and
it remains to be seen which protein should be the focus of

for regulators of TCF-dependent transcription. We identified
a number of chemical regulators that functioned at distinct
levels within the Wnt signaling cascade.

Human tumor cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, grown for less than 20 passages, and tested
regularly for Mycoplasma infection (Lonza Mycoalert).

Materials and Methods

Reporter cell line
A fragment of the Xnr3 enhancer (−180 to −60), four
TCF consensus-binding sites, and a c-Fos minimal promoter were inserted into the pUB-bsd blasticidin resistance
plasmid (Invitrogen). The luciferase gene and the IRESGFP-SV40 poly(A) sequences from pIRES-hrGFP-2a (Stratagene) were inserted downstream of the promoter (Fig. 1B).
The reporter vector was transfected into a stable HA-Dvl2-ER
(estrogen receptor)–expressing HEK293 cell line (11).
Blasticidin-resistant cells were treated with 9 mmol/L lithium chloride (LiCl) for 16 hours to induce Wnt-dependent
expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two rounds
of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were used to
enrich for high-GFP-expressing cell clones. The 7df3 clone
was used as the reporter line in the primary screen.

Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Wnt Signaling

Primary screen
Structurally diverse, low molecular weight compounds
(63,040) were added individually to reporter cells at
20 μmol/L 2 hours before addition of 10 μmol/L β-estradiol
in 384-well plates. Luciferase assays were carried out 24 hours
after β-estradiol addition using SteadyGlo reagent (Promega). Activities of primary hits were reconfirmed in further
luciferase assays and counterscreened for inhibition of luciferase enzyme (EasyLite kinase reagent, Perkin-Elmer) and
nonspecific cell growth inhibition (Celltiter Blue, Promega).
Secondary assays
Hit compounds (20 μmol/L) were assayed in transiently
transfected HEK293 cells cotransfected with Topflash (Wnt reporter, Upstate), TK-renilla (control), and cytomegalovirusdriven HA-Dvl2-ER expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were stimulated with 3 μmol/L βestradiol or treated with the glycogen synthase kinase-3
(GSK-3) inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO; Calbiochem). Luciferase activity was measured after 24 hours using
DualGlo reagent (Promega). For deconvolution assays,
HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Topflash and CMVlacZ reporter (control) plasmids together with constitutively
active core components of the pathway: ΔN-LRP, Axin-GID,
ΔN–β-catenin, and VP16-TCF4. Compounds were added 24
hours after transfection, and reporter activity was analyzed
a further 24 hours later using BrightGlo and BetaGlo (Promega).
Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase reporter activity. Experiments with c-myc and survivin-luciferase
reporters were carried out in HEK293 cells using Axin-GID
as the inducer. SW480 cells were cotransfected with Topflash
and CMV-lacZ reporter plasmids 24 hours before compound
addition. Reporter assays were conducted after a further
24 hours.
Growth inhibition (GI50)
Cells were seeded to give a density of 25% confluence after
24 hours in either 96- or 384-well tissue culture plates. Compounds (0.05–100 μmol/L) were added at 24 hours; Cell Titre
Blue or WST-1 (Roche) reagent was added after 72 hours
(HT29, SW480 and HCT116) or 96 hours (SNU475 and
CCD841Co).
β-Catenin stability experiments
Mouse L-cells were cultured in DMEM/10% fetal bovine
serum and exposed to 7.5 μmol/L BIO, 9 mmol/L LiCl, 50%
Wnt-3a conditioned medium (12), or 50 μmol/L MG-132
(Merck Biosciences), and with compound for 6 hours before
medium replacement as indicated. β-Catenin was assayed as
previously described (13). The following antibodies were
used: β-catenin and GSK-3β (BD Transduction laboratories)
and β-actin (Sigma). The β-catenin antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories was used for immunocytochemistry as
previously described (14).
For pulse-chase analyses, L-cells were treated throughout
with 7.5 μmol/L BIO. Cells were first starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 1 hour then labeled for
1 hour with 5 MBq per 25 cm2 flask of 35S-labeled methio-

nine/cysteine. Cells were chased with unlabeled medium
for the indicated periods. Cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using 2 μg/sample monoclonal
β-catenin antibody and 50 μL of Protein G–coated beads
(GE Healthcare). After three washes in lysis buffer, bound
proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by
electrophoresis, and analyzed as previously described (15).
Phosphorylated Tau experiment
HEK293 cells were transfected with GSK-3β and/or
Tau-1N4R expression vectors (16). After 48 hours, cells were
exposed to 5 μmol/L BIO for 8 hours, after which they were
treated with 20 μmol/L CCT031374 and 5 μmol/L BIO for the
indicated time periods. Immunoblotting for GSK-3β and
phospho- and nonphospho-Tau antibodies (BT2, AT270,
Autogen Bioclear) was carried out as previously described
(16). Band peak areas were calculated using ImageJ (Scion).
The phospho-Tau peak areas were normalized to the total
Tau levels.
Glutathione S-transferase–E-cadherin pull down of
β-catenin
The β-catenin binding region of E-cadherin (amino acids
730–882) was fused in frame with the glutathione S-transferase
(GST) coding region of pGEX-5X-2 (GE Healthcare). GST–Ecadherin fusion protein was expressed and purified using
Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare).
Ten-centimeter dishes of HEK293 and SW480 cells were treated
with CCT031374 and/or BIO and lysed to give a final volume
of 1 mL cell extract. Five micrograms of GST–E-cadherin
were combined with 500 μL of cell extract and precipitated
following addition of glutathione beads. Bound β-catenin
was detected by immunoblotting.
Embryonic stem cell quantitative PCR for LEF1
H9 human embryonic stem cells were cultured on feeders
using standard culture methods (17). Using a modification of
ref. (17), neurogenic embryoid bodies were generated by culturing H9 colony fragments in suspension in neutralizing medium (ADF, Invitrogen 12634010) containing 10 μmol/L
SB431542 (TGF-β Inhibitor, Tocris) and 10 μmol/L Y-27632
(ROCK inhibitor, Calbiochem) for the first 48 hours. On day
8, medium was supplemented with BIO (5 μmol/L) and/or
CCT031374 (20 μmol/L) for 24 hours. RNA was extracted
with Rneasy (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II Rnase H-RT (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR reactions
were done in DyNAmoHS master mix (New England Biolabs)
using the LEF1 primers 5′-accagattcttggcagaagg-3′ and
5′-cagaccagcctggataaagc-3′.
Xenopus studies
Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained, degelled, and cultured using standard procedures (18), and staged according
to Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF; ref. 19). Test compound or
DMSO (control) was added at the 4- to 16-cell stage. Embryos
were scored at NF stages 35 to 38. For the animal cap assay,
dissected Xenopus embryo animal caps were treated with
300 mmol/L LiCl for 10 minutes followed by 2.5 hours

exposure to CCT036477 at the indicated concentrations or
with DMSO control (indicated with dash). RNA extraction
and reverse transcriptase-PCR conditions were carried out
as described (20).
Zebrafish studies
Zebrafish embryos were collected after natural spawning.
Embryos were treated from the 16-cell stage until midgastrulation (8 hours postfertilization) with 20 μmol/L of compound
CCT036477 in 1% DMSO/fish water or with DMSO equivalent.
Control and experimental embryos were imaged when at the
postgastrulation somitic stage (48 hours postfertilization).

Results
Optimization and outcome of high-throughput screen
To identify novel small-molecule regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, a HEK293-based reporter cell line (7df3) was
generated to allow the inducible induction of TCF-dependent
transcription. The rationale for this approach was twofold.
First, inducible induction of the Wnt pathway was predicted
to minimize positive and negative feedback from transcriptional targets, thereby simplifying the process of target deconvolution. Second, the cell line did not require Wnt signaling
for proliferation, thereby allowing the rapid distinction of
nonspecific growth inhibitors and compounds acting specifically on the Wnt pathway.
A bicistronic reporter coding for firefly luciferase and
GFP under the control of a promoter containing four canonical TCF binding sites and the Wnt-responsive region
from the Xenopus Xnr3 promoter (ref. 21; Fig. 1B) was introduced into HEK293 cells that already contained an integrated Disheveled–estrogen receptor fusion (Dvl2-ER; ref. 11).
Previous studies showed that estradiol induction of Dvl2 activity raised β-catenin levels within 30 minutes in these cells
(11). Clones that showed tight regulation of TCF-dependent
transcription in response to estradiol and the GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl (Fig. 1C) were identified by FACS sorting.
Assays in a 384-well format showed reproducible 14-fold
and 10,389-fold induction with estradiol and LiCl, respectively, with low coefficients of variation (%CV) and high Z′
factors (estradiol, 0.59; LiCl 0.89; Fig. 1C). Importantly, the
cell line also showed robust behavior with multiple cellular
passages over more than 2 years. For the primary screen,
63,040 chemically diverse compounds were assayed by sequential addition of compound (20 μmol/L in 0.2% DMSO)
and estradiol 24 hours before luciferase assay. Data from a
subset of 384-well plates from the primary assay (Fig. 1D) illustrate the range of responses to compound addition. The
1,902 compounds that showed >50% inhibition were reassayed (n = 2) and counterscreened to exclude direct inhibitors of luciferase enzyme activity and to remove acutely
cytotoxic compounds. At this stage, 306 molecules were
selected for subsequent analysis (Fig. 2A).
Hit triage and mechanistic deconvolution assays
To identify molecules that specifically blocked TCF-dependent
transcription, compounds with a greater than 5:1 ratio of ac-

tivity against a TCF-luciferase versus a TK-renilla luciferase reporter were selected following cotransfection with a Dvl-2-ER
expression plasmid in HEK293 cells. Thirty-seven compounds
showed a greater than 5:1 specificity ratio together with low
toxicity and high TCF activity, as originally detected in the
7df3 reporter line (Fig. 2A). All 37 hits showed activity against
TCF-dependent transcription that was induced by treatment
of HEK293 cells with the GSK-3 inhibitor BIO (22).
To identify the point in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway at which the compounds acted, the pathway was activated at distinct levels by expression of activating cDNAs
(see Fig. 1A). At the receptor level, TCF-dependent transcription was induced by expression of a dominantly active
NH2 -terminal deletion of the LRP6 coreceptor, ΔN-LRP6
(23). Activation at the Disheveled level involved expression
of Dvl-2. At the GSK-3 level, transcription was activated
by expression of the GSK-3 binding domain of Axin (AxinGID), which acts to titrate GSK-3 from the endogenous
Axin protein (24). A nondegradable, β-catenin with an NH2terminal deletion (ΔN-89–β-catenin; ref. 25) activated transcription downstream of the β-catenin turnover complex,
and a TCF4-VP16 fusion protein was used to probe compound
activity at the level of the nuclear transcription factor. All
37 compounds blocked activation by Axin-GID: 9 of these
failed to block ΔN–β-catenin or TCF4-VP16 (i.e., they act at
the level of Axin), a further 8 blocked ΔN–β-catenin but failed
to block TCF4-VP16 (i.e., they act at the level of β-catenin),
whereas 20 compounds blocked all three activators (Fig. 2A).
Results from a subset of the deconvolution assays are shown
for three compounds (Fig. 2B and C).
Hit selection
Selective antiproliferative activity for human tumor cell
lines with Wnt pathway–activating oncogenic β-catenin,
APC, or AXIN deletions [HT29 (26), SW480 (27), HCT116 (28),
and SNU475 (29)], compared with a nontransformed epithelial
cell line, was used as a criterion in combination with chemical
tractability to focus on a subset of nine and subsequently three
compounds for further analysis (Table 1; Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1). The set of three compounds (CCT070535,
CCT036477, and CCT031374; see Fig. 2B) was selected based
on a combination of the following criteria: metabolic stability
(compound stability in mouse liver microsomes; Supplementary Fig. S2), low growth-inhibitory activity in nontumor control cells, promoter specificity (TCF versus TK), and the
availability of commercially available analogues. A key feature
in this selection was the clarity of the deconvolution response
to different Wnt pathway activators because unambiguous activity suggested that the mechanism of compound action
could be tracked in subsequent assays (Fig. 2C). All three compounds blocked HCT116 human colon cancer cell proliferation
by inducing apoptosis as shown by caspase-3 activity assays
(Supplementary Fig. S3), but CCT031374 induced almost twice
as much caspase activity than the other compounds.
Alteration of β-catenin stability
To assess whether the compounds altered β-catenin levels
or localization, mouse L-cells were treated with each

β-catenin degradation. Following 8 hours of incubation,
control BIO-treated cells showed a strong increase in total
β-catenin levels that was associated with raised nuclear
and cytosolic pools as determined by immunocytochemistry
(Fig. 3A and B). Of the top nine compounds, only CCT031374
prevented BIO-induced accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3A).

that was occasionally observed with endogenous β-catenin
in mouse L-cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). By contrast,
CCT036477 did not alter β-catenin levels but blocked transcription at the β-catenin level, although not by blocking
the interaction of β-catenin with the histone acetyltransferases CBP or p300 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Compound
CCT070535, which blocked TCF-dependent transcription at
the TCF level, did not alter BIO-induced levels of β-catenin,
but increased the levels of nuclear β-catenin (Supplementary
Fig. S4C).
Exploratory studies with CCT031374 series compounds
The IC50 for CCT031374 activity in blocking BIO-induced
β-catenin stabilization in L-cells was similar to that determined in the TCF-reporter cell line and transient assays
(Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that the compound may interfere with TCF-dependent transcription by
blocking the function of β-catenin. The activity of several
CCT031374 analogues showed both TCF-reporter and
BIO/β-catenin L-cell inhibition (Fig. 3D). The biphenylketo-methyl analogues (compounds 7, 8, 9, and 10 in Fig. 3C)
retained potency in the reporter cell assay comparable with
that of CCT031374 (compound 1 in Fig. 3D), but compounds
9 and 10 were significantly less potent in the L-cell β-catenin
stabilization assay (Fig. 3D). Compounds 9 and 10 have low
permeability in PAMPA assays (Supplementary Fig. S7),
which may confound the interpretation of compound activity
across different cell types. The remaining compounds (2–6 in
Fig. 3C) are less lipophilic close analogues of CCT031374 with
equivalent or lower potency (higher IC50 values) in the reporter and mouse L-cell assays. Because of the lipophilic basic nature of the compound series, compounds 11 and 12
(Fig. 3C), with a minimal core scaffold of similar pKa and lipophilicity, were tested as controls. Compounds 11 and 12
did not destabilize β-catenin in mouse L-cells, a finding con-

sistent with the hypothesis that CCT031374 activity on β-catenin levels is not solely due to a nonspecific effect driven by
the highly lipophilic and basic compounds.
To further characterize the mechanism of action of
CCT031374, a series of time-course analyses were done
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S8A,B). Although there seemed
to be a transient increase of β-catenin (Fig. 4A), this was
due to change of medium as it was also seen in the control
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S8A). When the β-catenin band
peak areas were normalized to that of loading control (Supplementary Fig. S8B), addition of CCT031374 was seen to reduce
levels of BIO-stabilized β-catenin within 60 minutes. Pulsechase analyses showed that CCT031374 increased β-catenin
degradation, within as little as 10 minutes of compound addition (Fig. 4A). By contrast, β-catenin stabilized with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was not degraded upon addition of
CCT031374, suggesting that proteasomal degradation may act
downstream of CCT031374 in lowering β-catenin levels
(Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, β-catenin stabilized by treatment of
cells with soluble Wnt-3A and LiCl (9 mmol/L) was resistant
to degradation induced by CCT031374 (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Direct comparison was not straightforward because
Wnt-3A and LiCl induction resulted in significantly lower
levels of β-catenin than with BIO induction (Fig. 4A).
To determine whether CCT031374 reversed the action
of BIO against other GSK-3 targets, an assay for GSK3–dependent Tau phosphorylation was used (Fig. 4B). As
expected, BIO was able to reduce GSK-3–dependent Tau
phosphorylation on Thr-181, a well-characterized GSK-3
phosphorylation site (30). The addition of CCT031374 largely
failed to reduce the BIO block of Tau phosphorylation, although there was a minor reversal of BIO action after 2 hours
of treatment. This low-level “response” to CCT031374 occurred much later than the effect of CCT031374 on β-catenin
levels, suggesting that the action against β-catenin was a

strong, immediate response to compound action (Fig. 4B).
Consistent with the Tau phosphorylation data, CCT031374
did not inhibit recombinant GSK-3 in a kinase assay (Supplementary Fig. S10). In addition, CCT031374 had no activity in
biochemical assays for PP1, PP2A, and tyrosine phosphatase
enzyme activity (Supplementary Fig. S11).
As CCT031374 blocked the growth of a number of cancer
cell lines, including SW480 colon cancer cells (Table 1), it was
anticipated that the compound would reduce free β-catenin

levels within these cells. Surprisingly, a pull-down assay with
GST–E-cadherin to detect free β-catenin levels found that
these were not altered by CCT031374 (Fig. 4C). By contrast,
CCT031374 blocked free β-catenin levels in BIO-stimulated
HEK293 cells (Fig. 4C). Despite the lack of effect on β-catenin
levels, CCT031374 reduced TCF-dependent transcription in
SW480 cells (Fig. 4D). Similarly, CCT031374 did not alter levels of free β-catenin resulting from overexpression of
ΔN–β-catenin or Axin-GID in HEK293 cells (Supplementary

Compound activity against known Wnt targets
The activities of CCT031374, CCT036477, and CCT070535
were tested against expression of known Wnt target genes using myc and survivin-luciferase reporter readouts (Fig. 5A).
Each compound showed activity against both promoters,
but responses were greatest against the c-myc promoter.
CCT031374 also showed activity against endogenous LEF1
mRNA levels in human neurogenic embryoid bodies (hNEB)
in which Wnt signaling had been induced by the GSK-3 inhibitor, BIO (Fig. 5B). CCT036477 was toxic to the hNEBs whereas
CCT070535 showed a weak, nonsignificant response. Expres-

In vivo activity of hit compounds
To obtain an integrated view of compound activity in multiple developmental stages, compounds were added to the
medium of Xenopus and zebrafish embryos during development. In these assays, CCT036477 showed the strongest phenotypic effects on both Xenopus and zebrafish development.
When added to Xenopus laevis embryos at the 4- to 16-cell
stage, CCT036477 ventralized embryos and interfered with
primary axis formation (Fig. 5C), as has previously been
shown for inhibitors of Wnt signaling (1). Consistent with
this observation, CCT036477 reduced expression of two
well-characterized Wnt target genes (Siamois and Xnr3) in
animal cap assays (Fig. 5B). CCT036477 addition to zebrafish

embryos at the 16-cell stage also induced axis defects, leading
to phenotypes (Fig. 5D) that have been associated with alterations to Wnt signaling (32).

Discussion
In the current study, we showed that a highly sensitive
Wnt reporter cell line can be used to identify small-molecule
inhibitors of Wnt signaling. The cell-based screen described
here was similar to previous studies by Emami and collea-

gues (5), Huang and colleagues (7), and Chen and colleagues
(3) in that it relied on the identification of compounds that
blocked the activity of an integrated TCF-luciferase reporter.
However, the present study used a reporter cell line that had
an inactive basal TCF-reporter that could be induced
through the activation of a Dishevelled–estrogen receptor fusion protein following addition of estrogen. The advantage of
this strategy is that Wnt signaling can be transiently induced
and that the cell response to inhibition of the pathway is less
likely to be dependent on complex positive and negative

feedback pathways commonly found in cancer cell lines (33–
35). Furthermore, cell lines whose growth is dependent on
the Wnt pathway have been shown to undergo apoptosis
(as seen for CCT031374, CCT036477, and CCT070535; Supplementary Fig. S3) following Wnt pathway inhibition, and this
can be difficult to distinguish from nonspecific cell killing
during high-throughput screening.
Multiple compounds were identified in the primary screen
that showed specificity for the TCF-reporter when compared
with control promoters. A hit triage/deconvolution cascade
was designed to identify the most promising candidates
among these compounds for further study. These assays included growth-inhibitory activity against tumor cell lines
with activated Wnt signaling. However, a key criterion was
the “clarity” of the deconvolution response such that reproducible, mechanistically consistent readouts were identified,
which allowed the logical pursuit of the mechanism of action
of the compound to distinct points in the Wnt pathway.
From a total of 63,040 compounds, 9 compounds that operated at either the β-catenin or TCF levels of the pathway
were selected for further investigation. Downstream assays
focused on 2 compounds that operated at the β-catenin level
and 1 that operated at the TCF level.
CCT031374 acted at the β-catenin level based on the observation that it blocked TCF-dependent transcription induced by a stabilized form of β-catenin (NH 2 -terminal
deletion of 89 amino acids; ref. 36), but not by a constitutively
active TCF-VP16 fusion protein. Consistent with this mechanism, CCT031374 increased the degradation of endogenous
wild-type β-catenin in mouse L-cells that had been stabilized
by the GSK-3 inhibitor BIO. CCT031374 did not increase
β-catenin NH2-terminal phosphorylation in the presence of
BIO-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that a pathway independent of phospho–β-catenin binding to β-TRCP
induced increased degradation. A number of alternative
β-catenin degradation routes have been described. These include pathways involving APC and the Siah1 ubiquitin ligase
(37, 38), the presenilin/PKA complex (39), and the protease
calpain (40). CCT031374 failed to induce β-catenin degradation products characteristic of calpain-induced proteolysis
(ref. 40; data not shown), suggesting that distinct novel pathways are involved in its mechanism of action.
Surprisingly, the block of TCF-dependent transcription in
SW480 colon cancer cells by CCT031374 was not accompanied by a corresponding reduction in β-catenin protein levels
(Fig. 4F). Moreover, levels of transfected stabilized β-catenin
(ΔN-89–β-catenin) were not reduced in HEK293 cells treated
with CCT031374 (Supplementary Fig. S12), although the compound blocked TCF-dependent transcription in these cells
(Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data argue that the degradation of β-catenin may not be necessary for the blocking effect

of CCT031374 on TCF-dependent transcription in all cellular
contexts, suggesting that CCT031374 operates through more
than one mechanism. A similar correlation between β-catenin
stability and TCF-dependent transcription was observed in
studies of the prolyl oligopeptidase Pin-1. Pin-1 activity correlated with both β-catenin stability and TCF-dependent transcription in HeLa cells by modulating its interaction with APC
(41). By contrast, in PTEN-deficient LNCaP cells, Pin-1 altered
TCF-dependent transcription without altering β-catenin levels by blocking β-catenin interactions with the androgen receptor (42). CCT031374 may similarly function through
molecular pathways that can be coupled to protein degradation in selected contexts.
Of the three compound series studied, only CCT036477
showed clear activity in vivo where it blocked development
of zebrafish and Xenopus embryos and expression of Wnt target genes. CCT031374 and CCT070535 did not show clear responses in these systems, and it is currently unclear whether
the compounds reached the required concentration to block
signaling in these in vivo models or whether their lack of
in vivo activity reflects a specificity for cells with oncogenically activated Wnt signaling. Overall, these studies have
identified novel small molecules that target distinct levels
of Wnt signal transduction pathway. Further studies with
these compounds (see Supplementary Fig. S13) could lead
to the identification of molecular targets of therapeutic benefit in multiple tumor types with activated Wnt signaling, and
further investigations will be published in due course.
