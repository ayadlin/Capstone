ABSTRACT:
The addition of anti-angiogenic therapy to the few treatments available to
patients with malignant gliomas was based on the fact that these tumors are highly
vascularized and on encouraging results from preclinical and clinical studies. However,
tumors that initially respond to this therapy invariably recur with the acquisition of a
highly aggressive and invasive phenotype. Although several myeloid populations have
been associated to this pattern of recurrence, a specific targetable population has not
been yet identified. Here, we present evidence for the accumulation of Tie2-expressing
monocytes/macrophages (TEMs) at the tumor/normal brain interface of mice treated
with anti-VEGF therapies in regions with heightened tumoral invasion. Furthermore,
we describe the presence of TEMs in malignant glioma surgical specimens that
recurred after bevacizumab treatment. Our studies showed that TEMs enhanced the
invasive properties of glioma cells and secreted high levels of gelatinase enzymatic
proteins. Accordingly, Tie2+MMP9+ monocytic cells were consistently detected in the
invasive tumor edge upon anti-VEGF therapies. Our results suggest the presence
of a specific myeloid/monocytic subpopulation that plays a pivotal role in the
mechanism of escape of malignant gliomas from anti-VEGF therapies and therefore
constitutes a new cellular target for combination therapies in patients selected for
anti-angiogenesis treatment.

INTRODUCTION

if treatment with the current standard of care for glioma
patients, which consists of surgery, the DNA-alkylating
drug temozolomide (TMZ), and radiotherapy, is initially
successful, nearly all malignant gliomas eventually
recur [3]. On the basis of reports of response rates [4,
5], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
in 2009 the use of bevacizumab, a human recombinant

Despite therapeutic advances over the last decade,
the diagnosis of glioblastoma, the most frequent and
aggressive type of primary brain tumor, is associated
with a median overall survival of 15-18 months and
with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% [1, 2]. Even

monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), for the treatment of recurrent
glioblastoma. There is a strong rationale for using antiangiogenic therapy for these tumors, as they are highly
vascularized—microvascular proliferation or necrosis (or
both) is an essential diagnostic criterion for glioblastoma
[6]—and several reports have confirmed that blocking
tumor angiogenesis inhibits tumor growth [7-9]. Beside
bevacizumab, additional anti-angiogenic monotherapies
have been or are being tested in trials for patients with
recurrent glioblastoma, such as the VEGF trap aflibercept,
which is a recombinant fusion protein that inhibits
both VEGF and placental growth factor, and the VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor cediranib. However, current
evidence from experimental and clinical studies suggests
that glioblastomas can recur after these therapies [10, 11]
as highly aggressive tumors characterized by enhanced
invasiveness and resistance to all currently available
therapies [9, 12-16]. The mechanisms underlying the
development of this invasive phenotype are not fully
understood.
Among the studies addressing the fact that recurring
tumors can be even more invasive and resistant to
treatment, several have addressed the contribution of
tumor/stroma interactions to the development of inherent
refractoriness or acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic
therapy. In murine preclinical models of lung cancer and
lymphoma, refractoriness to anti-VEGF therapy was
linked to tumor infiltration of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells
[17]. In clinical trials with glioblastoma patients treated
with aflibercept, a decrease in circulating VEGFR1+CD14+
monocytes was associated with improved response [18]. In
addition, autopsy results of patients who had been treated
with anti-angiogenic agents, including bevacizumab and
cediranib, revealed that higher number of CD11b+ cells in
bulk and infiltrative tumors correlated with poor overall
survival [19, 20]. However, the cell surface markers that
were used to identify those cell subsets can also be used
to identify a broad range of myeloid cells, and a specific
monocytic population associated with the heightened
invasion observed with anti-angiogenic therapy has not
been completely characterized.
Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) are a
subpopulation of circulating blood monocytes that have
recently been identified in several syngeneic and xenograft
tumors (such as gliomas, sarcomas, and kidney, colon,
pancreatic, and lung cancers) and in peripheral blood
of humans and mice [21-23]. TEMs are preferentially
recruited to tumors, where they constitute a prominent
monocyte population distinct from tumor-associated
monocytes [22-24]. We explored whether TEMs contribute
to the refractoriness of gliomas to anti-angiogenic
treatment. Our findings suggested that the presence of
TEMs is associated with the development of an invasive
glioma phenotype that is resistant to anti-VEGF therapy.

TEMs are overrepresented at the invasive front
of tumors that had been treated with anti-VEGF
agents
We previously described that U-87 MG intracranial
human xenograft-bearing mice treated with aflibercept
long term (6 weeks) had a longer median survival time
than did mice treated for only 3 weeks [25]. We also
reported that greater glioma invasion was associated with
the 6-week schedule, as characterized by the presence
of “satellitosis” or “secondary structures” involving
tumor cell aggregations in perivascular regions and in
Virchow-Robin spaces. These structures were easily
identified because this animal glioma model does not
display invasive features [25, 26]; accordingly, the
gliomas of human Fc region (hFc)-treated animals were
well delineated and exhibited no signs of invasion. In
the current study, we observed that this invasive glioma
phenotype was also present in animals that had been
treated with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, as
previously reported [12]. However, the invasive glioma
phenotype was not observed in animals treated with
TMZ (Figure 1A). To understand the role of stroma on
invasive glioma growth, we analyzed first for the presence
of microglia/macrophages, which have been reported to
be associated with adaptive resistance to anti-angiogenic
therapy [27, 28]. Using the F4/80 or Iba1 markers for
microglia/macrophages, we observed, as expected,
abundant F4/80+ and Iba1+ cells in surrounding necrotic
areas. In addition, we observed an increase in the presence
of this population in aflibercept-treated animals compared
with hFc-treated animals, although no notable differences
were observed in animals treated for 3 weeks (for noninvasive gliomas) or 6 weeks (for invasive gliomas) with
this drug (Figure 1B). Our observations suggested that this
perinecrotic myeloid population was not associated with
the invasive phenotype induced by anti-VEGF therapy.
Of interest, administration of aflibercept for 6
weeks was associated with significantly more F4/80+ cells
in the tumor/normal brain interface than was treatment
with aflibercept for 3 weeks (Figure 1B, P < 0.001). This
dramatic accumulation of microglia/macrophages in the
tumor/normal brain interface was corroborated using
another marker of myeloid lineage activity, Iba1. An
overrepresentation of Iba1+ cells was evident in the tumor/
normal brain interface in the two anti-angiogenic treatment
regimens that resulted in heightened glioma invasion
(6-week treatment with aflibercept or bevacizumab)
compared with the treatment regimens not linked to an
invasive glioma phenotype (hFc, 3-week aflibercept,
and TMZ) (Supplemental Figure S1). Together, these
results suggested that an increased presence of microglia/

macrophages in the tumor/normal brain interface is
associated with the invasive pattern observed in gliomabearing mice treated with anti-angiogenic agents.
A specific population of monocyte/macrophages,
TEMs, are a distinctive subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating
CD11b+ myeloid cells [23, 29]. To investigate whether
TEMs contribute to the heightened invasiveness of glioma
after anti-VEGF therapy, we initially immunostained for
Tie2 in human glioblastoma xenografts. Tie2+ cells were
present along the periphery of the tumor (Figure 1C,D)
and barely detectable in surrounding necrotic areas, in
contrast with the Iba1+ or F40/80+ cells that were present
in both locations (Figure 1B, Supplemental Figure S1).
Of interest, the number of Tie2+ cells was significantly
greater in the brains of the animals with an invasive

glioma phenotype (treated with aflibercept during 6 weeks
or bevacizumab) than in those harboring non-invasive
tumors (treated with vehicle, TMZ, or the short schedule
of aflibercept) (Figure 1C, P < 0.001, aflibercept-6 weeks
versus aflibercept-3 weeks).
Confocal microscopy analysis revealed colocalization of Tie2 expression with the Iba1 and F4/80
monocyte/macrophage markers, thereby identifying
monocytic lineage cells with heterogeneous morphology
(e.g., spindle, rod, and amoeboid shapes) and small nuclei
characteristic of “activated” microglia/macrophages
(Figure 2A). We detected more Tie2+Iba1+ cells at the
tumor edge in brains of mice treated with aflibercept
during 6 weeks or bevacizumab (invasive pattern) than
in mice treated with hFc, 3-week aflibercept, or TMZ

TEMs enhance the invasiveness of glioma cells

(non-invasive pattern) (Figure 2B-E). Our observations
supported the notion that infiltrative TEMs are associated
with the heightened invasion that occurs with antiangiogenic therapy.
To determine whether the Tie2+ myeloid cells
present in the tumor/normal brain edge upon antiVEGF therapy are an M2 polarized population [22], we
performed double immunofluorescence staining with
Tie2 and Arg1 [30]. Our observation of an accrual of
Tie2+Arg1+ cells at the invasive front of tumor-bearing
mice treated anti-VEGF agents (Supplemental Figure
S2) further supported an association between TEMs and
invasiveness upon anti-VEGF therapy.

Because we observed an association between the
presence of TEMs and heightened invasion upon antiVEGF therapy, we next examined the role of TEMs in
tumor invasion. To overcome the difficulties associated
with monocytic cultures, we generated an in vitro model
based on the THP-1 monocytic cell line by enriching this
culture for the presence of TEMs. Thus, we treated THP1 cells with interleukins 4 and 13 (IL4 and IL13) under
hypoxic conditions to induce M2 polarization and Tie2
expression [31, 32]. Under these experimental conditions,
we observed a significant increase in the number of
Tie2+CD11b+ cells within the THP-1 population compared

with parental or normoxia-cultured cells (Figure 3A, P <
0.001). In addition, we detected an increase in the relative
presence of phosphorylated Tie2 protein, via a cell-based
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), under
hypoxic conditions compared with normoxic conditions
(Figure 3B, P < 0.05) that was further enhanced in THP1 cells exposed to IL4 and IL13 (Figure 3B, P < 0.001,
2-tailed Student t-test).
In addition we exposed glioma cells to conditioned
medium from THP-1 cells with different levels of Tie2+
monocyte enrichment, as explained above. Compared
with the group treated under normoxia and without ILs,
the number of invading U-87 MG cells was higher in

the group cultured under hypoxic conditions (P < 0.01)
and was even higher when ILs were added (Figure 3C,
P < 0.001). Of interest, the expression level of Tie2 in
the monocytic cultures was significantly correlated with
the invasive properties of U-87 MG cells incubated with
conditioned medium from these cultures (Pearson’s r =
0.98; P < 0.05).
To further confirm the role of TEMs in promoting
an invasive phenotype of glioma cells, we sorted Tie2high+
and Tie2- subpopulations from THP-1 monocytic cells
(Figure 3D). Similar to the previous experiment, glioma
invasiveness through Matrigel was significantly higher
with conditioned medium from Tie2high+ monocytic cells

than with conditioned medium from Tie2- monocytic
cells (Figure 3E, P < 0.001, 2-tailed Student t-test). These
results were confirmed using GSC20 glioma stem cell
cultures (Figure 3E, P < 0.05, 2-tailed Student t-test).
These data highlight the superior potential of TEMs versus
other monocytic populations to induce invasion of glioma
cells.

(PBMCs) that were sorted for CD14+Tie2+ and CD14+Tie2cell subpopulations (Figure 4A). We then collected
the conditioned medium from both populations and
performed a gelatinase activity assay, which demonstrated
significantly greater median enzymatic activity in Tie2+
than Tie2- monocyte conditioned medium (Figure 4B; P
< 0.001). The levels of expression of the most significant
gelatinase enzymes in gliomas, matrix metalloproteinases
9 and 2 (MMP9 and MMP2) [33], were also greater in
the conditioned medium of CD14+Tie2+ cells than that of
CD14+Tie2- cells (Figure 4C; P < 0.001 for each), although
the MMP2 levels were in the low range of detection. These
data suggested that TEMs are a major cellular source of
MMP9. This result was corroborated using the in vitro
experimental THP-1 model. We observed an increased
in MMP9 activity via zymography assay in experimental
M2-polarized THP-1 cells (Figure 4D, P < 0.001).
To validate in vivo the described results, we

TEMs are a major source of MMP9 secretion and
activity
Because our results demonstrated that conditioned
medium from TEMs are responsible for enhancing the
invasive properties of glioma cells, we analyzed whether
this subpopulation is a source of tumor-remodeling
activity. To address this aim, we obtained monocyteenriched human peripheral blood mononuclear cells

Accumulation of TEMs in human malignant
glioma surgical specimens upon anti-VEGF
therapy

performed MMP9 immunostaining of brain tissue sections
from human glioma U-87 MG-intracranial bearing mice
treated with aflibercept for 6 weeks and then presenting
an invasive phenotype. In treated mice, staining revealed
MMP9+ cells at the tumor edge and peripheral invasive
tumor nodules with rod or amoeboid shapes characteristic
of “activated” microglia/macrophages, which were barely
observed in control animals (Figure 4E,F; Supplemental
Figure S3). Consistent with our in vitro data, staining
revealed that MMP9 co-localized with Tie2+ cells in
aflibercept-treated animals, as assessed by double
immunofluorescence and analysis of confocal z-stack
images (Figure 4G; Supplemental Figure S3).

Analysis of surgical glioblastoma specimens from
patients treated with bevacizumab showed an identical
distribution of this Tie2+Iba1+ cellular population in
the tumor periphery. Thus, TEMs were observed at the
advancing edge of the tumor after bevacizumab treatment,
as assessed by double Tie2/Iba1 immunostaining and
confocal microscopy (Figure 5A). Comparative studies
on the presence of Tie2+ cells in surgical samples obtained
after recurrence to standard therapy (temoradiation; n =
4) showed a significant increase in the number of Tie2+
cells when compared to those detected in surgical samples
obtained upon bevacizumab therapy (n = 3)(Figure 5B,

P = 0.01, Student t-test). Of further clinical relevance,
we detected a significant overrepresentation of TEMs in
surgical specimens upon bevacizumab therapy (Figure
5C, P = 0.01, Student t-test). Furthermore, in agreement
with our data obtained in the animal model, confocal
microscopy analysis confirmed that Tie2+ cells expressed
MMP9 (Figure 5D). To our knowledge, this is the first
evidence for the presence of TEMs in surgically excised
malignant gliomas, and for the association of TEMs with
the glioma recurrence after anti-VEGF therapy.

Of interest, we observed a significant increase in
the number of F4/80+ or Iba1+ cells at the tumor/normal
brain edge in tumors exhibiting invasion upon anti-VEGF
therapy compared to tumors from control mice and TMZtreated mice. Autopsy data derived from patients who
had been treated with cediranib showed that the tumors
exhibited a more infiltrative phenotype with an increase
of infiltrative CD68+ myeloid cells than in patients left
untreated or treated with chemotherapy [19]; however,
the researchers did not follow up on this association and
did not characterize this myeloid population. We report
here the striking association of the enhanced invasive
tumor pattern upon anti-VEGF therapy and the presence
of TEMs. This phenotype was observed upon treatment
with two anti-VEGF antibodies, bevacizumab and
aflibercept, but it was not present after treatment with
TMZ, the standard chemotherapy for malignant gliomas.
Although some researchers associate anti-VEGF therapy
with increased local invasion and distant metastasis, the
most supportive experiment of the specificity of this
relationship was reported by Paez-Ribes and colleagues
[16], who demonstrated that genetic disruption of the
VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway produced a similar adaptive
response as blocking the VEGF/VEGFR2 association
using small molecules or antibodies. Thus, the results we
obtained in our study could be common to therapies that
not only trap VEGF but also decrease VEGFR activity or
VEGFR/VEGF binding.
TEMs might be detected in blood of healthy donors,
but they have not been observed in normal, non-neoplastic
tissues [21-23]. TEMs have been found in syngeneic or
xenograft tumor mouse models [21-23]. Their presence
in surgically resected human specimens has not been
yet fully explored; our report is the first to show that this
population might be detectable in surgically resected
malignant gliomas. Although the number of TEMs
within a tumor appears to be relatively small [29], lossof-function studies using “suicide gene” approaches have
shown that depletion of TEMs specifically can block
tumor growth [9, 21]. However, no previous report has
associated the heightened invasion observed after antiangiogenic therapy with the over-representation of TEMs.
TEMs exhibit a more prominent glioma invasive
phenotype than non-TEMs do, as we observed using
glioma/monocyte co-culture conditions. We also
discovered that TEMs exhibited greater gelatinase activity
and production of MMP9 and MMP2. This finding was
consistent with data from a clinical trial with aflibercept,
in which tumor progression was associated with increased
levels of circulating MMP9 [18]. However, the roles
of MMP9 and MMP2 in the heightened invasion upon
anti-angiogenic therapy might be only one force behind
this phenomenon, and TEMs could secrete other tumorremodeling molecules that contribute to the adaptive
response [22, 39]. For that reason, the identification of
TEMs as a distinguishable population responsible for the

DISCUSSION
Our findings suggested that the presence of TEMs
is associated with the development of an invasive glioma
phenotype that is resistant to anti-VEGF therapy. This
specific Tie2+ monocytic population was present in tumor
infiltrative areas and displayed significantly greater
tumor-remodeling activity than Tie2- monocytic cells did,
establishing a pro-invasive environment for glioma cells.
Malignant glioma is characterized by a robust
angiogenic component and, although it is not a metastatic
disease, it exhibits a locally invasive pattern. The
regulation of invasiveness and angiogenesis seems to
be tightly interdependent: co-option of normal blood
vessels by infiltrating glioma cells has been shown to
be instrumental to the invasiveness of malignant glioma
and to be a precursor to neovascularization [9, 34-36].
Preclinical and clinical data, including those from our
studies and other groups’ studies, have shown that antiangiogenic therapy might result in an adaptive phenotype
characterized by enhanced invasiveness [12, 16, 25, 37,
38]. Several explanations for this switch towards invasion
have been proposed, including the contribution of the
tumor microenvironment in recruiting hematopoietic cells
into the tumor site [27].
We observed an over-representation of monocytic
populations in the bulk of the tumors of mice treated
with aflibercept, mainly in surrounding necrotic areas,
compared to control (untreated) animals. However, this
phenomenon was unrelated to the presence of an invasive
pattern, as it was observed after the two different treatment
schedules of aflibercept: a short (3-week) schedule that did
not result in increased invasiveness, and a long (6-week)
schedule that resulted in satellitosis and perivascular
infiltration. An increase in the monocyte/macrophage
population associated with anti-angiogenic therapy has
been reported [18] [20], although not specifically in
relation to increased invasion. Autopsy results of brain
specimens revealed that the presence of CD68+, CD163+,
and CD11b+ cells correlated with poor overall survival
among patients who first received anti-angiogenic therapy

malignant gliomas who were treated with aflibercept, a
decrease in VEGFR1+CD14+ monocytes from baseline to
24 hours was associated with better response [18].

heightened invasion upon anti-angiogenesis strategies
suggests a more successful target for glioma therapy.
Another possible therapeutic approach might be
derived from studies on the signals responsible for tumor
recruitment of TEMs after VEGF therapy, and probably
also accountable for the specific distribution of this
myeloid subpopulation within the tumor edge. Recruitment
of this subpopulation seems to be governed by signals
other than tumor-associated monocytes. CC chemokine
ligand 2 (CCL2) is a major chemoattractant for tumorassociated monocytes; however, TEMs do not express the
receptor CCR2 on their surface [40]. Several cytokines,
including angiopoietin 2, and chemokines CCL3, CCL5,
and CCL8, have been reported as chemoattractant
molecules for TEMs [40]. Detailed descriptions and
functional studies of changes of the cytokine milieu within
the tumor microenvironment upon anti-angiogenic therapy
could lead to targeting the upstream cause of resistance
to treatment. In summary, understanding the biology of
human TEMs may provide a novel, biologically relevant
marker of tumor resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy
and represent a previously unrecognized target of cancer
therapy.

weekly for 6 weeks, from day 5 after cell implantation),
or TMZ (7.5 mg/kg/day i.p., on days 4-8 and 18-22 after
cell implantation). Either phosphate-buffered saline or hFc
was administered as a control agent. Only those animals
exhibiting generalized or local symptoms of disease were
euthanized. Brains were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin. All animal studies were performed
in the veterinary facilities of The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center in accordance with institutional
guidelines.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Paraffin-embedded 5-µm tissue sections were
deparaffinized and subjected to graded rehydration prior
to staining procedures. For double immunofluorescence
studies, the tissue sections were subjected to heatinduced epitope retrieval (10 mM citrate buffer, pH
6.0) and blocked with 10% serum. Endogenous biotin
and streptavidin were blocked using avidin/biotin
and streptavidin/biotin kits (Vector) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Overnight staining at 4oC with
antibodies against Tie2 (C-20, diluted 1:100; Santa Cruz),
MMP9 (AF911, diluted 1:50; R&D Systems), mouse Arg1
(V-20, diluted 1:1,000, Santa Cruz). Bound antibodies
were detected by incubation with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibody and DyLight 549 streptavidin (diluted
1:1,000; Vector). When required, the fluorescence signal
was amplified with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody
(diluted 1:500; Vector) followed by additional Dylight 549
strepavidin. Sections were incubated overnight at 4oC with
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted
1:1,000; Invitrogen).
Staining for F4/80 was used to detect microglia/
macrophages in tumor sections. Heat-induced epitope
retrieval was followed by 10 minutes of incubation with 20
µg/mL proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3%
H2O2. Blocking reagent from the Perkin Elmer tyramide
signal amplification-plus fluorescein kit was used per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Incubation with an anti-F4/80
antibody (CI:A3-1; diluted 1:400; Serotec) was done
overnight at 4°C and followed by 30 minutes of incubation
with biotinylated secondary antibody and peroxidaseconjugated avidin (ABC Elite Kit; Vector). Sections were
then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
tyramide reagent for 5 minutes.
We also stained for Iba1 to detect microglia/
macrophages in tumor sections. Standard antigen retrieval
procedures and blocking with 10% serum were followed
by incubation with an anti-Iba1 antibody (019-19741;
diluted 1:1,000; Wako) overnight at 4oC. Afterwards,
slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
antibody (diluted 1:1,000, Invitrogen). Fluorescent-labeled
slides were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma), mounted with fluorescence mounting

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line
THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection) was
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (SAFC
Biosciences). When indicated, THP-1 cells were incubated
under hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2)
and treated with IL4 and IL13 (20 ng/mL each; R&D
System) for 48-72 hours to induce M2 polarization.
U-87 MG human glioma cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were cultured in minimum essential medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GSC20
glioma stem cultures (generous gift by Dr. Frederick Lang,
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) were established from a
human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) surgical specimen
and maintained as described previously [41]

Animal studies
U-87 MG cells (5 × 105) were implanted in the
caudate nucleus of 6- to 8-week-old athymic nude mice
(Harlan Sprague Dawley) by the screw-guided method
as previously described [25]. The animals were then
randomly separated into one of three treatment groups
(10-15 mice per group): aflibercept (25 mg/kg s.c. twice
weekly for a total of 3 weeks or 6 weeks, from day 10
after cell implantation), bevacizumab (10 mg/kg i.p. twice

medium (Dako), and examined under a fluorescent Zeiss
Axiovert 200M microscope, an Olympus Fluoview
FV1000 confocal microscope, or both.
For immunofluorescence analysis, 10 pictures
from each experimental group were acquired under a
20x objective lens (HPF, high power field). The number
of Tie2+, F4/80+, and Tie2+/Iba1+ cells was quantified in a
double-blind manner by two different researchers.

R&D Systems) (both, diwtion 1:10) in the presence of cellsurface Fc receptor-blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec).
The suspension of stained cells was then subjected to flow
cytometric analysis and cell sorting (FACSAria, Becton
Dickinson) to obtain non-TEMs (CD14+/Tie2- cells) and
TEMs (CD14+/Tie2+ cells).

Matrigel invasion assay

Immunohistochemical analysis

For the invasion assay, Tie2+ and Tie2- THP-1 cells
were isolated using a FACSAria cell sorter as described
above and the condition medium was collected. Twenty
four-well Transwell inserts (ThinCert-TC inserts, 8.0 µm;
VWR) were coated with 0.3 mg/mL basement membrane
matrix (growth factor reduced, LDEV free; BD Matrigel,
BD Biosciences) for 2 hours at room temperature. A total
of 1 x 105 U-87 MG or GSC20 cells was washed with
serum-free medium, suspended in 250 µL of serum-free
medium, and seeded onto Matrigel-coated transwells. The
lower chambers of 24-well plates were filled with 500
µL of conditioned medium from Tie2+ and Tie2- THP-1
cells. After 24h of incubation, procedure was performed
as previously reported [41]. Briefly, the remaining cells
on the upper surface were mechanically removed using a
cotton swab. The cells under the chamber were fixed with
methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (SigmaAldrich) for 20 minutes. Invading cells were counted
under an Axioskop 40 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with
Zeiss AxioVision Release 4.2 software (200x objective
lens).

To perform immunohistochemical analysis, we
quenched endogenous peroxidase activity with 3%
H2O2. Sections were blocked with 10% rabbit serum,
incubated with anti-MMP9 antibody (M-17; diluted
1:100, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C, and then incubated
with biotinylated secondary antibody followed by
peroxidase-conjugated avidin (ABC Elite kit, Vector) for
30 minutes each. The reaction was developed using stable
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Research Genetics). Then, the
sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin and
mounted with Cytoseal 60 (Thermo Scientific). Images
were captured using a bright-field microscope (Zeiss
Axioskop 40).

Flow cytometry and isolation of TEMs
To measure the expression level of Tie2, 5 × 105
THP-1 cells were incubated with a reagent that blocks
the cell-surface Fc receptor (120-000-442, Miltenyi
Biotec) and exposed to phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse
anti-human Tie2 antibody (FAB3131P, R&D Systems)
and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse antihuman CD11b antibody (ab25827-100, Abcam). Mouse
immunoglobulin G isotypes were used as controls.
Samples were run on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur,
Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using CellQuest software.
To isolate Tie2+ and Tie2- subpopulations, THP-1 cells
were incubated with IL4 and IL13 (20 ng/mL each, R&D
Systems) under hypoxic conditions for 48-72 hours. Then
cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse
anti-human Tie2 antibody as described above. Tie2+
and Tie2- cells were sorted with a FACSAria cell sorter
(Becton Dickinson) and cultured for further experiments.
PBMCs were prepared from healthy blood donors
(Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX) by
centrifugation on a Ficoll-Plaque Plus (GE Healthcare)
density gradient as previously described [42]. CD14+
monocytes were purified from PBMCs by positive
selection using CD14 MicroBeads (120-000-305,
Miltenyi Biotech) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The
monocyte-enriched population was then double stained
with anti-human allophycocyanin-conjugated CD14
antibody (FAB3832A, R&D Systems) and anti-human
phycoerythrin-conjugated Tie2 antibody (FAB3131P,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Gelatinase assay
Gelatinolytic activity in conditioned medium
from THP-1 cells or in PBMCs obtained from human
peripheral blood was measured using the ENZCheck
gelatinase/collagenase assay kit (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Conditioned medium
was collected as described above. Briefly, 100 µL of
conditioned medium from similar numbers of cells were
incubated with 12.5 µg/mL DQ gelatin (Invitrogen) for 2
hours at room temperature. Fluorescence activity resulting
from digestion of DQ gelatin substrate was measured
at 495 nm for absorption and 515 nm for emission
wavelength.

ELISA
We measured the level of MMP9 and MMP2
secretion in conditioned medium from CD14+Tie2+ and
CD14+Tie2- monocytic cell populations sorted from
buffy coats from healthy human blood donors (Gulf
Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX). We used
human MMP9 and MMP2 Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D
2217

Oncotarget

System) for quantification according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
The Tie2 phosphorylation level in THP-1 cells
exposed to normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or
absence of IL4 and IL13 was determined using the
human phospho-Tie-2 (Y992) cell-based ELISA (R&D)
as per the company’s procedure. Briefly, we measured
the phosphorylated Tie-2 (Y992) level in whole THP-1
cells grown on 96-well plates and exposed to normoxia or
hypoxia in the presence or absence of IL4 and IL13. The
cells were fixed, and a double immunoenzymatic labeling
procedure was used to detect phospho-Tie-2 (Y992) and
total Tie2 levels. Two secondary antibodies labeled with
either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase
and two spectrally distinct fluorogenic substrates for
horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase were
used for detection. The fluorescence level of the phosphoTie2 protein was normalized to that of total Tie2 in each
well to correct for well-to-well variations.
