BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine how patient preferences guide the course of palliative chemotherapy
for advanced colorectal cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were enrolled nationwide in a
prospective, population-based cohort study. Data were obtained through medical record abstraction and patient surveys. Logistic
regression analysis was used to evaluate patient characteristics associated with visiting medical oncology and receiving chemotherapy and patient characteristics, beliefs, and preferences associated with receiving >1 line of chemotherapy and receiving combination
chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among 702 patients with mCRC, 91% consulted a medical oncologist; and among those, 82% received
chemotherapy. Patients ages 65 to 75 years and aged 75 years were less likely to visit an oncologist, as were patients who were too
sick to complete their own survey. In adjusted analyses, patients aged 75 years who had moderate or severe comorbidity were less
likely to receive chemotherapy, as were patients who were too sick to complete their own survey. Patients received chemotherapy
even if they believed that chemotherapy would not extend their life (90%) or that chemotherapy would not likely help with cancerrelated problems (89%), or patients preferred treatment focusing on comfort even if it meant not living as long (90%). Older patients
were less likely to receive combination first-line therapy. Patient preferences and beliefs were not associated with receipt of >1 line of
chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients received chemotherapy even if they expressed
negative or marginal preferences or beliefs regarding chemotherapy. Patient preferences and beliefs were not associated with the

INTRODUCTION
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the value of patient-centered care. Patients who are involved in decision
making are more knowledgeable about their care and are more satisfied with their care.1,2 Patient dissatisfaction with treatment-related decision making may have a negative impact on the quality of cancer care.3 Patient preferences should be
emphasized particularly in the setting of advanced cancer, in which the treatment is palliative. For example, although
chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer can modestly extend survival, such treatment is associated with
the risk of significant toxicity.4 This balance between possible benefit versus probable risk necessitates a patient-centered
approach to treatment decision making. However, studies suggest that the improper use of chemotherapy near the end of
life may reflect inadequate shared decision making between patient and physician.5 Physicians may believe it is easier to
offer chemotherapy to the patient with advanced cancer rather than engaging in challenging end-of-life discussions.6

Chemotherapy and Patient Preferences/Zafar et al

For their part, patients may prefer to take a passive decision-making role when considering therapy for advanced
cancer.7,8 What remains unclear is how patient preferences guide the course of palliative chemotherapy for
advanced cancer.
To evaluate the quality of patient-centered care for
patients with advanced cancer, an important question
must be answered: Do patient preferences play a role in
treatment-related decision making for palliative chemotherapy? We conducted a multiregional cohort study of
patients with advanced colorectal cancer to assess factors
associated with visiting a medical oncologist and receipt
of chemotherapy, specifically addressing the effect of the
patient’s role in decision making, quality of communication with their physician, overall quality of care, preferences for treatment, and their beliefs and concerns regarding
treatment. We hypothesized that patient preferences
would play a role in treatment-related decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Study participants were enrolled by the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium. CanCORS is a prospective, observational,
population-based and health care systems-based cohort
study to determine how characteristics and beliefs of cancer patients, providers, and health care organizations
influence treatments and outcomes.9 Patients aged 21
years with colorectal cancer were enrolled within 3
months of diagnosis between September 2003 and January 2006 from 1 of the following: 5 geographic regions, 5
integrated health care systems in the National Cancer
Institute-funded Cancer Research Network, or 15 Veterans Affairs hospitals. Patients were followed for 15
months past enrollment. Only patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (n ¼ 702) were included in this analysis.
Data Collection

Primary data were collected from medical records, patient
surveys, and surrogate surveys.9-11 Trained abstractors at
each of the data-collection sites abstracted medical records
data, including cancer diagnosis, initial tumor location,
and stage. Medical records data also wee used to verify
medical oncology visits, to determine the first line of
chemotherapy received (defined as the first chemotherapy
regimen used to treat the patient’s metastatic colorectal
cancer), and to determine whether the first line of therapy
was single-agent or combination therapy (more than 1
chemotherapeutic agent). Comorbidity was abstracted
from the medical record and was scored using the Adult
Cancer

February 15, 2013

Comorbidity Evaluation 27, a 27-item index that was
developed to provide prognostic information for cancer
patients.12
Patient surveys were completed in English, Chinese,
and Spanish using computer-assisted telephone interviews. A surrogate (relative or household member) who
was familiar with the patient’s cancer care was interviewed
for patients who had died or were too ill to be interviewed.
The surveys (available at www.cancors.org/public;
[accessed August 26, 2012]) used previously validated
items and scales whenever possible and assessed patients’
sociodemographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, annual income), insurance coverage, comorbid conditions,
and beliefs about cancer care; survey development has
been previously described.11 Surveys also assessed quality
of communication with their physician (5 items),11 overall quality of care (2 items), preferences for treatment (2
items), and beliefs and concerns regarding treatment (9
items).11 For patients who were too ill (n ¼ 60) or had
died (n ¼ 140), a survey was administered to a surrogate
when available. Most patients completed the survey after
treatment was started. A human subject committee
approved the study protocol at each participating site.
Statistical Analysis

We calculated descriptive statistics summarizing sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity, treatment, and
survey-based patient preferences and beliefs. We used
logistic regression to assess factors associated with visiting
a medical oncologist and receipt of chemotherapy. Four
analytic models were developed to assess factors associated
with: 1) visiting a medical oncologist any time before survey completion, 2) receipt of chemotherapy, 3) receipt of
combination versus single-agent first-line therapy, and 4)
receipt of only 1 line versus more than 1 line of therapy.
In Models 3 and 4, we considered the variables that
addressed role in chemotherapy decision making, quality
of communication with their physician, overall quality of
care, preferences for treatment, and beliefs and concerns
regarding treatment. These variables were not included in
Model 1 because not all of those patients completed a survey. They also were not included in Model 2 because they
were available only for patients who visited an oncologist
and completed a full survey (n ¼ 409). Among the
patients who completed a full survey, only 23 patients did
not receive chemotherapy; and an effective sample of 23
was too small to produce reliable results in logistic
regression.
A consistent model-building approach was used
for all outcomes. Four variables were included

unconditionally in all models: age, comorbidity, sex, and
race. Survey respondent (patient vs surrogate) was
included as a variable in Models 1 and 2. Step-wise model
refinement was applied with P ¼ .20 criterion for entering
variables into the models and P ¼ .10 criterion for removing them from the models. If necessary to prevent over fitting, the least significant variables were removed to attain
model degrees of freedom to an effective sample size ratio
of 7.13 Multiple imputation was used to address item
nonresponse for survey-based variables and was performed centrally by the CanCORS Statistical Coordinating Center.14 The results from multivariable models
incorporated formal imputation adjustments.15
Data analysis was conducted at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which is the coordinating site
for Veterans Affairs hospitals participating in CanCORS.
For the current analysis, we used CanCORS core data
(version 1.9), medical record data (version 1.9), and
patient survey data (version 1.8). Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS for Windows (version 9.2; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).

with visiting a medical oncologist, which reflected the
greater severity of illness and functional decline among
patients who were unable to fully participate in the survey.
Patients who had their surveys completed by a surrogate
or patients without any survey data were less likely to visit
a medical oncologist than patients who completed their
own surveys. Variables addressing role in chemotherapy

This analysis was limited to survey responses from the full patient survey or the full surrogate survey for living patients, because items of interest were only
asked in those survey versions.

P values were based on 2-sided Fisher exact tests excluding missing responses, ‘‘not applicable,’’ and ‘‘don’t know.’’

Chemotherapy Regimens

Of those who consulted an oncologist (n ¼ 640), 527
patients (82%) received chemotherapy. Figure 3 illustrates the most common first-line, second-line, and thirdline chemotherapy regimens. For their first-line chemotherapy regimen, 32% of patients received only singleagent therapy (eg, fluorouracil or capecitabine). Among
477 patients who had available chemotherapy regimen
data, 63% received more than 1 line of chemotherapy.
The regimens received as first-line therapy generally were
in concordance with those listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s colorectal cancer guidelines
between 2003 and 2006, a period inclusive of patient
enrollment for the current study.
Receipt of Chemotherapy

Unadjusted analyses are presented (Table 2). Among
those who visited an oncologist, patients who reported a
858

preference for extending their life were more likely to
receive chemotherapy than those who were focused on
comfort (99% vs 90%; P < .001). Patients who believed
chemotherapy would extend their life were more likely to
receive chemotherapy than those who thought it unlikely
that chemotherapy would extend their life (99% vs 90%;
P ¼ .008). Patients who believed that chemotherapy may
help with cancer-related problems were more likely to
receive chemotherapy than those who thought
chemotherapy would be unlikely to help (100% vs 89%;
P < .001).
In multivariable analysis (Fig. 4) age, comorbidity,
and survey respondent were associated significantly with
receipt of chemotherapy. The oldest patients (aged 75
years) were least likely to receive chemotherapy compared
with those aged <55 years. Patients with moderate or
severe comorbidity were less likely to receive

chemotherapy than those with no comorbidity. Patients
who had their surveys completed by a surrogate were less
likely than patients who completed their own surveys to
receive chemotherapy. Patients without any survey data
had a similarly lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. Variables addressing role in chemotherapy decision
making, quality of communication with their physician,
overall quality of care, preferences for treatment, and
beliefs and concerns regarding treatment were not
included in this model because they were available only
for patients who visited an oncologist and completed a
full survey (n ¼ 409). Among this group, only 23 patients
did not receive chemotherapy; the effective sample of n ¼
23 would have been too small to produce reliable results
in logistic regression models.
Intensity of First-Line Chemotherapy

Multivariable analysis examined the association between
characteristics, preferences, beliefs, and intensity of firstline chemotherapy, as defined by receipt of combination
therapy (more than 1 drug) versus single-agent therapy
(Fig. 5). The oldest patients were less likely to receive
combination therapy as a part of their first-line regimen.

treatment, beliefs, and concerns regarding treatment were
assessed but were not associated significantly with the
receipt of combination first-line therapy.
Number of Chemotherapy Regimens

Multivariable analysis examined the association between
characteristics, preferences, beliefs, and the number of
chemotherapy regimens received. Patient characteristics,
role in decision making, quality of communication with
their physician, overall quality of care, preferences for
treatment, beliefs, and concerns regarding treatment were
assessed, but none were associated significantly with the
receipt of combination first-line therapy (data not
shown).
DISCUSSION
Given the substantial toxicity and personal costs associated with modest survival gains from metastatic colorectal
cancer treatment, we hypothesized that patient preferences would play an important role in the receipt of palliative chemotherapy. We observed that patients who had
beliefs and preferences favoring chemotherapy were statistically more likely to receive treatment. Nonetheless, the
vast majority of patients who expressed a preference for
comfort-oriented care believed that chemotherapy would

be unlikely to extend their life, or they did not believe that
chemotherapy would help with cancer-related problems,
although they still received chemotherapy. Patient preferences, beliefs, concerns about treatment, actual and preferred
role in decision making, and the quality of communication
with their physician were not associated with the intensity or
number of chemotherapy regimens received.
Patient Preference in Palliative Chemotherapy
Decision-Making

Why did the majority of patients receive chemotherapy
despite reporting beliefs and preferences that would seem
incongruent with this treatment choice? Patients who
offered negative or marginal views about chemotherapy in
our survey still may have elected to receive treatment in
the hopes that they would fall into the group of patients
who experience a meaningful benefit with minimal harm.
This sense of optimism may have played a role in our findings, because patients who were a ‘‘little likely’’ to expect a
benefit may have considered the risks of treatment reasonable. Patients with advanced cancer often are more willing
than their providers to accept a greater risk of harm for a
smaller benefit.16 In addition, patients may disregard their
own negative views of treatment if they are in conflict
with their physician’s view.3,17,18
860

In the metastatic setting, in which the benefit of
treatment is limited, patients may be more likely to defer
treatment decision making to their physician.7 Hence,
clinical factors rather than patient preference appear to
have a disproportionate role in the treatment decisionmaking process. Our study indeed suggests that clinical
factors, in particular age and comorbidity, influence the
receipt of chemotherapy. These findings are consistent
with a substantial body of literature indicating that older,
sicker patients are less likely to receive chemotherapy,16,19-22 including the analysis by Kahn et al, who
focused on patients with stage III colorectal cancer who
were enrolled on the same study described here.10 Furthermore, completion of the survey by a surrogate rather
than by the patient likely serves as a proxy for poor performance status.10 We observed that that completion of a
surrogate survey was negatively associated with visiting a
medical oncologist, receiving any chemotherapy, and
receiving more than 1 line of chemotherapy. Older
patients who were diagnosed with metastatic colorectal
cancer had lower odds of being referred to a medical
oncologist. Although older patients are at greater risk of
being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, our cohort
included patients who already had been diagnosed. Furthermore, our model adjusted for comorbidity, race, and
Cancer

sex. Hence, age remains an independent predictor of referral to medical oncology.
Appropriateness of Palliative Chemotherapy
Use

Multiple studies have suggested that there is under use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer.10,20,22-26
The same degree of evidence is not available for the palliative
setting in the United States, although several studies have
described low rates of palliative chemotherapy use for
advanced colorectal cancer outside the United States.27-31
However, appropriate use of palliative chemotherapy for
advanced cancer is difficult to discern without detailed clinical information. Because guidelines do not recommend the
treatment of patients with a poor performance status, some
patients are not candidates for chemotherapy from the time
of diagnosis. Our analysis does not suggest an under use of
chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer in the United
States. We observed that, among the patients who reported a
preference for chemotherapy or who favored quantity over
quality of life, virtually all received chemotherapy. In addition, the first-line chemotherapy regimens prescribed were
largely those included in the clinical guidelines that were
available at the time of data collection. Taken together, these
data suggest that concerns regarding the potential under use
of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer largely may be put to rest.
Our findings are subject to limitations. We were
unable to model the association between preferences, beliefs,
and receipt of chemotherapy because of small effective sample sizes. However, unadjusted results are presented and are
informative. In addition, we assessed associations between
those variables, the intensity of chemotherapy, and the number of lines of chemotherapy. We did not collect data detailing the conversation between patient and provider, so we
cannot determine how that conversation may have colored
patient preferences or beliefs about chemotherapy. Most
patients completed the survey after their treatment decisions
had been made. Their preferences or beliefs may have been
different if measured before treatment decision making.
However, over the course of cancer care, patient preferences
tend to shift in favor of treatment,32 and the majority of
patients who expressed negative opinions toward chemotherapy still received treatment. Furthermore, we were
unable to assess the impact of online, print, nursing, or navigation resources in patient decision making. We did not
focus on the use of chemotherapy at the very end of life and
cannot comment on overuse in that setting, as reported
extensively in the literature.5 Our data were collected
between 2003 and 2006, and the focus on shared decision

making has evolved over time. Finally, some survey items
pertaining to preferences and beliefs were created specifically
for CanCORS. Their validity has not been tested, but the
survey tool was thoroughly piloted.11
This study has several strengths. Our analyses are supported by both medical records and patient self-reported
data. Patients were enrolled from multiple geographic
regions and health care settings, and few exclusion criteria
were applied. It has been demonstrated that the patients enrolled in CanCORS are demographically representative of
the geographic regions in which they were enrolled.33
In summary, treatment decisions in the palliative setting were not always congruent with stated preferences and
beliefs regarding chemotherapy. The vast majority of
patients who expressed negative or marginal preferences or
beliefs regarding chemotherapy still received chemotherapy. Patient preferences and beliefs were not associated
with the intensity or number of chemotherapy regimens
received. In addition, under use of palliative chemotherapy
was not evident. These findings shed new light on the
patient experience and decision making in the use of palliative chemotherapy and can shift the focus of health services
research in advanced cancer from investigating under use of
treatment to the inclusion of patient preferences in decision
making. Research should focus on tailoring delivery of care
based on patient preferences and beliefs.
