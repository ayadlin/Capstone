ABSTRACT
Background: Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β has emerged as an appealing
therapeutic target for glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we investigated the therapeutic
effect of the current approved drugs against GBM via inhibition of GSK3β activity
both, in experimental setting and in a clinical study for recurrent GBM patients by
repositioning existent drugs in combination with temozolomide (TMZ).
Materials and Methods: Progression-free and overall survival rates were compared
between patients with low or high expression of active GSK3β in the primary tumor.
GBM cells and a mouse model were examined for the effects of GSK3β-inhibitory
drugs, cimetidine, lithium, olanzapine, and valproate. The safety and efficacy of the
cocktail of these drugs (CLOVA cocktail) in combination with TMZ were tested in the
mouse model and in a clinical study for recurrent GBM patients.
Results: Activation of GSK3β in the tumor inversely correlated with patient survival
as an independent prognostic factor. CLOVA cocktail significantly inhibited cell invasion
and proliferation. The patients treated with CLOVA cocktail in combination with TMZ
showed increased survival compared to the control group treated with TMZ alone.
Conclusions: Repositioning of the GSK3β-inhibitory drugs improved the prognosis
of refractory GBM patients with active GSK3β in tumors. Combination of CLOVA
cocktail and TMZ is a promising approach for recurrent GBM.

INTRODUCTION

GSK3β promotes GBM progression by interacting with the
pivotal molecules that participate in tumor cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, and resistance to chemoradiation
therapy [10, 11]. We and others have reported that GSK3β
inhibition attenuates the proliferation, migration and
invasion of GBM cells by modulating distinct molecular
pathways, and sensitizes them to chemotherapeutic agents
and radiation [12–19]. These studies have substantiated
GSK3β as therapeutic target of GBM.
Despite experimental evidence supporting the
therapeutic effect of GSK3β inhibition, none of GSK3β
inhibitors was approved for treatment of diseases such as
diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. The
development and approval of new drug is a time-consuming
and expensive process with high rate of failure. Recently,
drug repositioning to find new applications for existing
drugs has emerged to overcome this challenge [20].

Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most common
primary brain tumor in adults, is highly malignant with
exhibiting aggressive clinical manifestation and a median
life expectancy of less than 2 years [1]. Biologically, GBM
is characterized by its high proliferative and invasive
activity [2]. Only a few drugs were prescribed for GBM:
temozolomide (TMZ) [3], biodegradable carmustine
(BCNU) wafer [4, 5], and bevacizumab [6, 7]. Till date,
no effective therapeutic for GBM has emerged despite the
development of a variety of molecular-targeted agents
such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors [8].
Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β is a
serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates various
cellular pathways depending on its substrates by
phosphorylation [9]. Emerging evidence suggests that

Effects of the GSK3β-inhibiting drugs on
invasion and proliferation of GBM cells

Drug repositioning attempts to discover new
therapeutic options for already approved drugs, as their
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and post-marketing
surveillance safety data are readily available [21]. Drugs
such as cimetidine, lithium carbonate, olanzapine,
and valproate, prescribed for other diseases inhibited
GSK3β activity [22–24]. In the present study, these
GSK3β-inhibiting drugs were examined for therapeutic
effect against GBM in experimental settings. We also
explored whether GSK3β activity in clinical tumor tissues
influences the survival of GBM patients to rationalize
the targeting of GSK3β. Based on these experimental
and clinical findings, we conducted a clinical study
to investigate the safety and therapeutic effect of
repositioning GSK3β-inhibiting medicines in combination
with TMZ, in patients with recurrent GBM.

The Transwell assay showed that all 4 drugs
inhibited the invasion of GBM cells to extracellular matrix
(Supplementary Figure 3A). Lithium showed proliferationinhibition at 5 mM and 10 mM in T98 and U87, while only
at 10 mM in U251 cells. Valproate at 5 mM and 10 mM
inhibited proliferation of all the 3 cell lines. However, neither
cimetidine nor olanzapine inhibited cell proliferation at the
indicated concentrations (Supplementary Figure 3B), and
this issue was discussed later.
Next, we investigated the effect of CLOVA cocktail
that consists of the 4 drugs as a mixture at the lowest
concentrations (cimetidine, 0.1 mM; lithium, 1 mM;
olanzapine, 0.1 µM; and valproate, 1 mM) concomitant
with TMZ on GBM invasion and proliferation. The
concentrations of cimetidine, lithium, and valproate used in
culture medium were determined according to their blood
concentration at the administration of maximum daily
dose, because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is damaged in
GBM tissue. The dose of olanzapine was calculated based
on its intracerebral concentration at the administration of
maximum daily dose and its high BBB permeability and
accumulation in brain tissue [25]. As expected, CLOVA
cocktail itself showed additive inhibitory effect on cell
invasion (Figure 2B) while TMZ showed no effect at the
same time point (data not shown). CLOVA cocktail and
TMZ inhibited cell proliferation equally, and moreover
the combination of them showed remarkable inhibitory
effect on cell proliferation (Figure 2C). The results shown
in Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 collectively
suggest a causal association between the effects of CLOVA
cocktail against the GSK3β activity of GBM cells and their
proliferative and invasive capacity.

RESULTS
Activated GSK3β is an unfavorable prognostic
marker in GBM
First, we investigated the expression of GSK3β and
pGSK3βY216 (active form) in clinical samples. Interestingly,
survival analysis of 57 patients with GBM showed a
significant correlation between pGSK3βY216 expression and
both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) (Figure 1). Subgroup analysis of age, Karnofsky
Performance Scale (KPS), and O6-methylguanine-DNAmethyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status, and extent of
resection (EOR) showed no statistical difference between
GSK high group and GSK low group (Supplementary
Table 1). Univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier method
showed methylated MGMT promoter, less age, and high
EOR as predictive factors in our cohort (Supplementary
Figure 1). Multivariate analysis revealed that activation of
GSK3β was an independent unfavorable predictive factor
(Table 1).

Effect of CLOVA cocktail on GBM cell invasion
and proliferation in a brain tumor model
The tumor histology of our animal model
demonstrated several features, characteristic of human
GBM, including high proliferative and invasive nature.
Inhibition of GSK3β activity by treatment with each drug
and the CLOVA cocktail was confirmed by the decreased
level of pGSS641 in tumor cells, especially in satellite
lesions, and the effect of CLOVA cocktail was strongest
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4). Similarly, the
number of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells that stained
positive for nestin significantly decreased in CLOVA
cocktail-treated mice (Figure 3A and 3B). Consequently,
well-demarcated border between the tumor and adjacent
normal brain tissues was observed both in mice treated
with each drug alone and the combination (Supplementary
Figure 4, Figure 3). Previous studies showed that focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1 interact [26] and facilitate
GBM invasion [27, 28]. The attenuated invasive capacity

Inhibition of GSK3β activity by existing drugs
We examined whether the existent drugs (cimetidine,
lithium, olanzapine and valproate) inhibit GSK3β activity
in cells by monitoring the level of pGSS641, the primary
substrate of GSK3β (reviewed in ref. [9]). The levels of
pGSS641 in all GBM cells decreased following treatment
with each drug (Supplementary Figure 2). Hereafter the
combination of these drugs is referred as “CLOVA cocktail”
by the initial letters of each drug. While there were some
differences in the GSK3β-inhibitory effect among the drugs
and cell lines, the CLOVA cocktail decreased the level of
pGSS641 in all GBM cells more efficiently than each of
the cocktail constituents (Figure 2A). The results indicate
that doses of these four medicines mixed in the CLOVA
cocktail are within the ranges of clinical use nevertheless
this cocktail inhibits GSK3β activity in GBM cells.

of GBM tumors following treatment with CLOVA cocktail
was associated with decrease in activating phosphorylation
of (pFAKY397 and pFAKY861; Supplementary Figure 5) and
with alteration in subcellular localization of active Rac1 in
tumor cells (Figure 3C). These findings are consistent with
our earlier study showing that GSK3β inhibition decreased
active Rac1 fraction and FAK phosphorylation in human
GBM cell lines [29].
To compare the tumor proliferative potential, MIB-1
immunostaining was performed. Interestingly, MIB1 staining index remarkably decreased in CLOVA
cocktail treated-mice (Figure 4A), while less marked
reduction was observed in mice receiving individual
drug treatment (Supplementary Figure 4). TMZ alone
and in combination with the CLOVA cocktail reduced
the tumor size while the effects were not statistically
significant (Supplementary Figure 6). Of note, CLOVA
cocktail significantly prolonged survival of the mouse
model (Figure 4B).

2 weeks before death. Median OS after first recurrence
was 11.2 (95% CI, 3.8–18.6) months in patients treated
with concomitant CLOVA cocktail with maintenance
TMZ although they were classified into RPA class 7
wherein the median survival duration was estimated as
4.9 months [31], compared to median OS of 4.3 (95% CI,
2.5–6.1) months in historical control group (log-rank test,
p = 0.004) (Figure 5B). The concomitant CLOVA cocktail
with TMZ was safe and well tolerated. Most common
treatment-related AE was grade 1/2 somnolence caused
by antipsychotic drug constituents of CLOVA cocktail
(Table 2). A representative case showed marked reduction
of the recurrent tumor assessed as partial response (PR)
9 months after beginning of CLOVA cocktail (Figure 5C).
Immunohistochemistry using the respective antibodies
(Supplementary Table 2) of pretreatment and autopsy
tissue showed decrease in pGSS641, nestin, MIB-1 index
(pretreatment 32.9% to autopsy 8.0%) and MGMT
levels (Figure 5D), suggesting that the CLOVA cocktail
treatment inhibited GSK3β activity, attenuated tumor
invasion and enhanced TMZ effect, similar to in vivo
experiment (Figures 3 and 4).

Phase I/II clinical study
Seven patients were enrolled in this study
(Figure 5A). All patients were eligible following
radiological disease progression (Macdonald criteria [30])
and classified as Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA)
class 7 [31]. Median age was 66 years and median KPS
was 50. MGMT promoter methylation was determined
in 4 patients (57%). Three patients took CLOVA cocktail
on the day before death and 4 patients discontinued the
oral medication because of aspiration pneumonitis,

DISCUSSION
In this study, we first demonstrated the independent
prognostic relevance of tumor-GSK3β activity as
detected by the increased level of pGSK3βY216 that
inversely associated with survival of GBM patients,
while no correlation was found between the expression
level of mRNA and total protein and the prognosis

(data not shown). This suggests aberrant GSK3β activity
in the tumor cells as a new prognostic factor in GBM
and clinically rationalizes the strategy of targeting of this
kinase for treatment of GBM. We also found therapeutic
effects of the existent GSK3β-inhibiting medicines against
GBM in the experimental and preclinical settings as well as
a clinical study for the chemotherapy-resistant refractory
patients. Previously, we and others have reported that
inhibition of GSK3β activity attenuated proliferation

and invasion of GBM cells and sensitized them to
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation by modulating
distinctive molecular pathways [19, 29]. Consistent with
our earlier study [29], we confirmed that inactivation of
GSK3β suppressed the molecular axis involving FAK
and Rac1 in the present preclinical study. It is notable
that the cocktail of GSK3β-inhibiting medicines tested in
this study attenuated survival, migration and invasion of
GBM cells and animal-model tumors. This cocktail also

revitalized TMZ against recurrent GBMs and this effect
was associated with decreased MGMT expression in the
patient, thereby resulting in improvement of prognosis
in patients of GSK high group in spite of low EOR. Our
present study reinforces the cancer therapeutic effect of
GSK3β inhibition by repurposing these medicines for
GBM. It also suggests the necessity for the development
and approval of specific GSK3β inhibitors to achieve
efficient therapeutic effect for diseases including cancer.
Combination of multiple drugs with different
mechanisms of action and/or different binding sites of
a same target is often required for cancer chemotherapy
to optimize the therapeutic effects, minimize the adverse
effects, and prevent the development of treatment
resistance [32, 33]. CLOVA cocktail showed additive
effect on GBM proliferation and invasion (Figures 2 and 3;
Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) but no adverse effect
in the treated mice. Notably, cell viability showed no
difference between control group and the group treated
with CLOVA cocktail at the point of 8 hr when invasion
assay was evaluated (data not shown). Nowicki et al

also demonstrated that the effect of GSK3β inhibition on
migration occurred earlier time points than effects on cell
viability [34]. There are several ways of inhibiting GSK3β
activity. They include up-regulation of pGSK3βS9 (inactive
form), down-regulation of pGSK3βY216 (active form)
and targeting the catalytic domain and/or the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket structure in this
enzyme (Supplementary Figure 7) [9]. Cimetidine potently
blocks the catalytic domain of GSK3β. Lithium has dual
inhibitory effects on GSK3β to induce phosphorylation of
serine 9 (S9) residue and to compete with Mg2+ that is
required for GSK3β-dependent substrate phosphorylation.
Olanzapine also increases the level of S9 phosphorylation
and docks with the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3β.
Valproate directly inhibits the activated GSK3β wherein
Y216 residue is phosphorylated. Aberrant regulation
of pGSK3βY216 could promote the malignant features of
GBM [18, 19, 35] since it is an independent prognostic
factor for GBM patient in the present study. Elevated
pGSK3βY216 fraction contributed the malignant feature
of pancreatic cancer [36] and inhibition of pGSK3βY216

enhanced the effect of imatinib inducing apoptosis in
chronic myeloid leukemia [35]. These knowledge and
observations support the present study showing that
lithium and valproate inhibiting pGSK3βY216 exhibited
stronger antitumoral effect than cimetidine and olanzapine
that induce pGSK3βS9.
We define or regard the CLOVA cocktail as a
single drug (the mixture of four constituents) basically
in this study, and showed its effects against GBM cells
proliferation and invasion. This effect is consistent with
a substantial number of previous studies including ours
showing the tumor-promoting roles of GSK3β, therapeutic
effect of its inhibition and the underlying biological
mechanisms in various cancer types including GBM
[9–16]. The less effect of cimetidine and olanzapine (both
repurposed, but not specific GSK3β inhibitors) on GBM
cell proliferation at their limited dose ranges does not
always make a denial of the solid evidence for the critical

role of GSK3β in promoting proliferation of tumor cells
including GBM.
Each of the GSK3β-inhibiting medicines has
unique cancer therapeutic mechanisms other than its
GSK3β-inhibitory effect. Cimetidine is a histamine
H2 receptor antagonist prescribed for gastroduodenal
ulcers and its anti-tumor activity was reported in many
cancer types including glioma. It was shown to attenuate
cell proliferation and migration by blocking histamine
that promotes tumor angiogenesis [37, 38]. Lithium is
a classical, non-competent GSK3β inhibitor [23] and
prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar
mood disorders and depression [39]. A previous study
showed a reversible dose-dependent effect of lithium
on attenuation of glioma cell invasion via inhibition
of GSK3β activity [34]. Olanzapine is one of the
most frequently prescribed anti-psychotic agents for
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [40]. It has attracted

the attention of neuro-oncologists because of its ability
to enhance the cytotoxic effects of TMZ on GBM [40].
GSK3β inhibition by olanzapine stimulated adenosine
monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase catabolic
action followed by induction of p53-dependent autophagy,
which enhances the pro-apoptotic effect of TMZ [41].
Valproate is approved for treatment of epileptic seizure,
bipolar disorder, and migraine. It acts as a histone
deacetylase inhibitor [42] that alters the chromatin
structure, consequently increasing DNA accessibility to
anticancer drugs and enhancing the effect of radiation
[43, 44], in addition to other anticancer mechanisms [45].
In addition to their effects on GSK3β, lithium and
valproate induced autophagy via inhibition of inositol

monophosphatase [46] and modulation of oxidative
stress [47], respectively, resulting in cancer therapeutic
effect. Anti-tumor effects of valproate were tested by a
number of clinical trials [48] and some studies showed
significant survival in GBM patients treated with valproate
[43, 45, 47]. Recently, a meta-analysis invalidated the use
of VPA for reasons other than seizure control in patients
with newly diagnosed GBM outside clinical trials [50],
suggesting the limitations of single medication with
GSK3β-inhibitory drug.
Based on the results of our experimental and
preclinical studies shown here, we conducted a clinical
study for the TMZ-resistant recurrent GBM patients
by repositioning of the GSKβ-inhibiting medicines in

combination with TMZ (UMIN:00005111). Patients
treated with this regimen showed significant longer
survival (median survival 11.2 months after recurrence)
than historical control (median survival 4.4 months)
treated with TMZ alone even though all the former
patients were classified as RPA 7 in which the bad
prognosis is predicted [31]. Immunohistochemical analysis
of the patients’ tumors (Figure 4) suggested that the
repurposed drugs inhibited GSK3β activity in the tumor
cells, decreased expression of MIB-1 cell proliferation
marker, and reduced invasion by the residual tumor
cells. Although this clinical study has limitations such as
single institution and small number of patients enrolled,
it was first to provide the evidence of GSK3β-targeted
cancer therapy based on drug repositioning. Not all, but
combination of some GSK3β-inhibiting medicines might
be enough for inhibition of aberrant GSK3β in the tumors.
The next step toward clinical translation of this therapeutic
strategy is to plan a large-scale, prospective multicenter
trial to establish the optimum combination of the GSK3βinhibiting medicines. A subsequent trial is also important
to compare the effects of them in combination with TMZ
and with bevacizumab. It will clarify whether the GSK3βtargeted therapy can prevent the GBM invasion enhanced
in the bevacizumab-resistant tumors [51, 52].
Accumulating evidence has shown that inhibition of
GSK3β provides dual benefits for the treatment of GBM
patients by attenuation of tumor progression [17, 29] and
protection from neurodegenerative effects of irradiation
[53, 54]. This study also supports and promotes future
clinical translation of the GSK3β-targeted therapy by drug
repositioning. To ascertain the effect of GSK3β-targeted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy with repurposing drugs, large multicenter clinical
trial is currently in progress to validate the efficacy and
safety of CLOVA cocktail in combination with TMZ, and
best combination of the drugs composed of the cocktail in
patients with recurrent GBM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Established predictive factors and GSK3β
activity in the tumor of GBM patients
We examined 57 patients with GBM (Supplementary
Table 1) for influence of tumor-GSK3β activity on
their survival. This study was approved by Kanazawa
University Medical Ethics Committee. Fresh tumor tissues
were obtained by biopsy and surgery and the remaining
tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathologic
examination and immunohistochemical analysis. The
histological diagnosis was determined according to the
revised World Health Organization criteria [55].
Established predictive factors including age [56],
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) [56], EOR [57], and
methylation in O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) gene promoter [58] were analyzed in these patients.
Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were calculated from the initial operation to last magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and to death, respectively. Logrank test for univariate analysis was performed to determine
statistical significance of Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Cox
proportional hazard regression model was used to identify
the multivariate predictors of survival.

immunohistochemically for the level of phosphorylation
at tyrosine (Y) 216 residue (pGSK3βY216). Representative
paraffin sections of the tumors were immunostained with
GSK3β and pGSK3βY216 antibodies (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) (Supplementary Table 2), using
Envision+ Kit (DAKO Japan, Kyoto, Japan) as described
previously [60]. Images were acquired with a BZ-X700
microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) and digitally
processed with the Keyence Analysis Software. The
patients were classified into 2 groups depending on the
level of pGSK3βY216 as “GSK high” (≥ 50% of the tumor
cells were labeled) and “GSK low” (< 50% of the tumor
cells were labeled). Immunohistochemical evaluation was
carried out by neuropathologist (H.S.) and oncologist
(T.M.) in independent readings.

imetidine, lithium, olanzapine and valproate were
purchased from WAKO Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).
For stock solutions, cimetidine and olanzapine were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and lithium and
valproate were dissolved in distilled water. As described
in the Results, the concentrations of these drugs used in
culture medium were as follows: cimetidine: 0.1, 0.5, and
1 mM; lithium: 1, 5, and 10 mM; olanzapine: 0.1, 0.5, and
1.0 μM; and valproate: 1, 5, and 10 mM. The combination
of these drugs at their lowest concentration was referred as
“CLOVA cocktail” by taking the initial letters of each drug.
Temozolomide (TMZ) was purchased from SigmaAldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The concentration of this
agent was 200 µM for cell culture and 100 mg/kg for
animal model experiment.

Western blot analysis
Cellular protein was extracted from cultured
cells following the treatment using lysis buffer (SigmaAldrich) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). A 15-μg aliquot of whole
protein extract was analyzed by Western immunoblot
for the protein of interest (Supplementary Table 2), as
described previously [66]. β-actin was used as loading
control. Immunoblot signals were measured using the CS
analyzer (version 2.0; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion assays were performed using modified
Boyden chambers consisting of Transwell with pre-coated
Matrigel membrane filter inserts in 24-well tissue culture
plates (BD Biosciences) as described previously [66].
Serum-deprived cells suspended in DMEM containing 0.1%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) were added to each Transwell.
After incubation at 37°C for 8 h, non-invading cells were
removed by wiping the upper side of the membrane, and the
invading cells were fixed with methanol and stained with
Diff-Quick Kit (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The invading cells
on the filter were counted from 8 randomly selected highpower microscopic fields. The mean number of cells and
standard deviations were calculated.

Cell culture
Human glioma cell lines T98, U87, U251, and U138
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) in 2009. These cell lines were characterized
in the resource institute by short tandem repeat profile
analysis. Authentication of the cell lines was unnecessary
because cells were expanded by culturing them for less
than two passages and stored at −80°C. Low-passage cells
were used for experiments within the period of 6 months
after resuscitation. They were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO2. All cells
were Mycoplasma free.

Cell proliferation assay

Existent GSK3β-inhibiting medicines and
temozolomide

Alamar Blue assay (Biosource, Camarillo, CA,
USA) was performed according to manufacturer’s manual.
Practically, 1,000 cells of each population were seeded in
wells of 96-well plastic plates in 200 μl of culture medium
supplemented with 0.1% FBS. The plates were incubated
for 4 h at 37°C, and 20 μl Alamar Blue (10% of total
volume) was added to the cells and incubated. The plate
was read on a fluorescence plate reader (excitation, 30 nm;
emission, 590 nm) at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Averages of
the fluorescence values were calculated and plotted. To

Six GSK3β-inhibitory drugs were reported;
lithium [61, 62], cimetidine [63], gemifloxacin [63],
hydroxychloroquine [63], olanzapine [64], and valproate
[24, 65]. Of these, 4 drugs were selected because of their
general usage for the symptoms of the patients suffering from
brain tumor; cimetidine for gastroduodenal ulcer, lithium and
olanzapine for mood disorder, and valproate for seizure.

Design of clinical study

investigate the influence of drugs on cell proliferation,
cells were serum starved for 24 h and seeded in the
proliferation assay format. The cells were then treated with
various concentrations of each drug, CLOVA cocktail,
TMZ, or with the latter two in combination.

The single center, single-arm, clinical study
investigated the efficacy and safety of CLOVA cocktail
in combination with TMZ in patients with recurrent
GBM in Kanazawa University Hospital from January
2009 to October 2010 under approval by Medical Ethics
Committee of Kanazawa University (UMIN Clinical Trial
Registry: UMIN000005111). Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients. Primary endpoint was
OS after first recurrence. Secondary endpoint was safety
compared with matched historical control population
treated with TMZ alone.

Mouse model of GBM and treatment
Following an institutional review board-approved
protocol, we generated a mouse brain tumor model
of human GBM by retrovirus-mediated introduction
of the mutant K-ras gene (K-rasG12V) in neurospheres
derived from the brain of p16Ink4A−/−/p19Arf−/− mouse and
transplantation of them into the brain of wild-type mice
according to our previous study [67]. The activation of
GSK3β was validated both in the cultured sphere and the
in vivo developed tumor by Western blot (data not shown).
These mice were treated with the CLOVA cocktail or TMZ
either alone or in combination. Practically, the 20 mice
were randomly assigned to four groups for treatment with
H2O/DMSO as control (n = 5), CLOVA cocktail alone
(n = 5), TMZ alone (n = 5), and CLOVA cocktail and TMZ
in combination (n = 5). Each drug of CLOVA cocktail at
dose equivalent to the human dose was normalized to
mice weights as follows; cimetidine 13.3 mg/kg; lithium
6.7 mg/kg; olanzapine 167 μg/kg; and valproate 13.3 mg/kg.
CLOVA cocktail was orally administered every day and
TMZ was administered intraperitoneally at 100 mg/kg
for first 5 days. Following 2 weeks of treatment, all 20
mice were euthanized. For survival study, the 10 mice
were treated with H2O/DMSO (n = 5) or CLOVA cocktail
(n = 5). All animal experiments followed the Guidelines
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Kanazawa
University that covers the national guideline.
Representative paraffin sections of the tumors were
immunostained for glycogen synthase phosphorylated
at S641 residue (pGSS641), MIB-1, nestin, and focal
adhesion kinase phosphorylated at Y397 and Y861
residue (pFAKY397 and pFAKY861) using the respective
antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) as described above.
Nestin-positive tumor cell clusters were scored to evaluate
the degree of invasion as described previously [68].
Representative paraffin sections of the tumors were
immunostained with a 1:50 dilution of anti-active Rac1
monoclonal antibody (NewEast Biosciences, King of
Prussia, PA, USA) and then incubated in biotinylated
horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by incubation with
Alexa Fluor 594-labelled streptavidin (1:500; Vector
Laboratories). Non-immune mouse serum at 1:50 dilution
was used as negative control in immunostaining. The
stained sections were mounted with the mounting medium
for fluorescence with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany).
Images were captured with a BZ-X700 microscope
(Keyence).

Patients
Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with histologically
proven recurrent GBM after standard chemoradiation
therapy with TMZ were eligible for the study (Table 2).
Treatment
CLOVA cocktail comprising 800 mg cimetidine, 400 mg
lithium, 10 mg olanzapine, and 800 mg valproate was orally
administered daily. Dose of each drug was determined based
on medical package insert, and therapeutic drug monitoring
of lithium and valproate was performed every month.
Maintenance TMZ at 200 mg/m2/day was administered for 5
consecutive days every 4 weeks (Figure 5A).
Efficacy and safety assessments
A baseline gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan was
performed within 1 week before beginning the treatment.
MRI was repeated every 1 month. Progression was based
on investigators’ clinical and radiological assessment
according to Macdonald criteria [30]. Safety was evaluated
by descriptively summarizing adverse events (AEs),
laboratory assessments, and physical examinations. All
AEs were recorded according to Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.
Matched historical controls
Matched historical controls were identified from
records of patients with recurrent GBM who had received
treatment with maintenance TMZ at 200 mg/m2/day in
Kanazawa University Hospital (Supplementary Table 3)
same as the patients enrolled the study.

Statistical analyses
Statistical significance was determined using
Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher’s exact
test for comparison of two groups as appropriate. Log-rank
analysis was used to determine statistical significance of
Kaplan-Meier survival curve. All analyses were performed
using SPSS statistical package version 19 for Macintosh
(IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The significance level
was set at p = 0.05.
