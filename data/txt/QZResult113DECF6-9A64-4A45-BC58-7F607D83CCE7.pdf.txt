ABSTRACT
The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is believed to
contribute to carcinoma development by increasing cell invasiveness and metastasis
and inducing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Protein phosphatase
PPM1A has been reported to dephosphorylate TGF-β-activated Smad2/3, thus
inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of
PPM1A in bladder cancer. PPM1A protein expression was analyzed in 145 bladder
cancer specimens. The loss of PPM1A expression was predictive of poor survival
and high muscle-invasiveness. PPM1A was more commonly deficient among muscleinvasive relapse samples compared to primary tumors in twenty paired bladder cancer
tissues. Functional studies indicated that blockade of PPM1A through lentivirusmediated RNA interference significantly promoted urinary bladder cancer (BCa) cell
motility, the EMT in vitro and metastasis in vivo, and these effects were dependent on
the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. The increase in p-Smad2/3 induced by TGF-β1
correlated with the degree of PPM1A depletion in BCa cells, which resulted in an
altered expression profile of TGF-β-inducible genes. The correlations between PPM1A
and biomarkers related to the TGF-β signaling pathway and tumor invasion were also
detected in BCa samples. These results demonstrate that loss of PPM1A is associated
with the development of tumor invasion in bladder cancer.

BCa has a high risk of recurrence, and 1/3 of patients will
progress to muscle invasion [3, 4]. Muscle-invasive BCa
is clinically unfavorable, with a 5-year overall survival
rate of 48% to 67% [5]. To date, the molecular mechanism
underlying muscle-invasive BCa remains unknown.
Tumor invasiveness and metastasis involve
biological cascades consisting of multiple steps, including
the loss of cellular adhesion, increased motility and
invasiveness, entry and survival in the circulation, exit into
new tissue and the eventual colonization at a distant site.

INTRODUCTION
Urinary bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common
malignancy of the urinary tract, with 73,000 new cases
and 15,210 deaths in 2013 in the US alone [1]. Urothelial
carcinoma represents approximately 90% of BCas that
arise from an epithelial origin. BCa is classified into
superficial (pTa, pT1 and CIS) and muscle-invasive
(pT2-4) cancer based on whether the tumor infiltration
extends to the muscular bladder wall [2]. Non-invasive

The TGF-β signaling pathway is believed to contribute to
carcinoma development by increasing cancer cell motility,
invasiveness and metastasis and inducing the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [6, 7]. However, this
signaling pathway has a dual effect on tumor growth, with
both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities,
depending on the stage of carcinogenesis and cell type
involved. Previous studies have also shown that the TGF-β
pathway plays important roles in the tumorigenesis of BCa
[8], and plasma TGF-β1 levels were markedly elevated
in patients with muscle-invasive BCa; the highest plasma
TGF-β1 levels were observed in patients with bladder
carcinoma that had metastasized to the lymph nodes[9]. The
TGF-β-induced Smad signaling pathway has been studied
extensively in an effort to understand the complex and
versatile responses governing tumor metastasis, increased
motility, invasiveness and the EMT [10-12]. As the TGF-β
signaling pathway influences such diverse biological
events, it is logical and definite that tight regulations exist
to control TGF-β signaling pathway activation.
PPM1A (protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+
dependent 1A) is a member of the PP2C family of Ser/
Thr protein phosphatases [13], and it has been shown
to dephosphorylate TGF-β-activated Smad2/3, thus
enhancing disassembly of the activated Smad complex
and promoting the nuclear export of dephosphorylated
Smad2/3 [14, 15]. PPM1A has also been implicated
in the regulation of cell invasion and migration [16].
Moreover, further studies also imply that PPM1A is
an important tumor suppression factor [17, 18]. As
the precise role of PPM1A in BCa remains largely
unknown, we hypothesized that PPM1A may be
regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and
involved in BCa development and progression. In this
study, we investigated the clinicopathologic significance
and potential role of PPM1A in invasion and the EMT
in BCa.

differentiated tumors. Correlation analyses indicated that
histological grade was significantly associated with the
loss of PPM1A expression (p = 0.012) (Supplementary
Table 1). These results indicate that in BCa, the loss
of PPM1A is significantly associated with poorly
differentiated tumors.
Furthermore, 20 matched pairs of primary tumors
and recurrent bladder cancer samples were analyzed for
PPM1A protein expression (Figure 1B). The information
of these patients was shown in Supplementary Table 2.
The PPM1A protein expression differed between primary
superficial tumors and muscle-invasive recurrent cancer
tissues with more negative staining among the recurrence
samples (p = 0.012). We found that PPM1A expression
was significantly lower in muscle-invasive recurrence
compared to primary carcinomas in situ (Figure 1C). In
recurrent non-muscle-invasive BCa tissues and paired
primary tumors, there was no significant difference in
the expression of PPM1A (Supplementary Table 2).
Consistent with these findings, we observed that there
was a significant correlation between PPM1A expression
and muscle invasion in the 145-patient cohort (p < 0.01).
Muscle-invasive cancer presented significantly lower
levels of PPM1A than non-invasive BCa (pTa, pT1 and
CIS) (p < 0.01) (Figure 1D).
Additionally, as shown in Figure 1E, Kaplan–Meier
survival curves and the log-rank test Survival analysis
showed that the overall survival of patients with negative
PPM1A expression was significantly poorer than that of
patients with a high level of PPM1A (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1E).
PPM1A expression was strongly associated with the tumor
stage (p = 0.038) (Supplementary Table 1). These results
suggested that the loss of PPM1A expression may be a
poor prognostic factor for survival in BCa patients and
may mediate more aggressive characteristics, such as poor
differentiation and high muscle invasiveness.

Downregulation of PPM1A significantly
promoted the invasive capacity of BCa cells
in vitro in a TGF-β1-dependent manner

RESULTS
Decreased PPM1A expression was associated with
muscle invasion and poor prognosis of BCa

Our clinical findings suggested that PPM1A could
be an important molecule that regulates muscle invasion in
BCa. As such, we sought to further study the role of PPM1A
in BCa cells. We assessed PPM1A expression and the levels
of activation of Smad2 and Smad3 using Western blotting
in a panel of BCa cell lines (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure 1A). We found that PPM1A was expressed in all
5 BCa cell lines, and 5637 and T24 cells were chosen for
further PPM1A studies. Three RNAi sequences targeting
human PPM1A were used to generate cells with stable
knockdown of PPM1A expression. Western blot and
RT-PCR analysis revealed that one of the lentiviral small
interfering RNAs (RNAi #1) was able to reduce endogenous
PPM1A protein expression by over 80% relative to the level
in control cells (Figure 2B and Figure 2C).

We first assessed PPM1A expression using an IHC
assay in 145 cases of BCa. Positive immunostaining for
PPM1A was observed in the nuclei of BCa cells, with or
without cytoplasmic staining. Tumors were considered
negative for PPM1A expression when there was no
nuclear staining or staining in < 5% of the tumor cells
(n  =  46), positive staining in ≥ 5% of the neoplastic
cells was considered nuclear staining (n = 99). PPM1A
expression was lost in 18.8% (17/90) of the superficial
BCa and in 52.7% of the muscle-invasive cancer samples.
Fig1A shows that the expression of PPM1A was higher
in well differentiated tumors, lower in moderately
differentiated tissues, and lost in most of the poorly

To assess our hypothesis that PPM1A regulates
BCa invasiveness, we evaluated the effect of PPM1A
knockdown on BCa cell migration and invasion using
a wound closure assay and transwell chambers with
Matrigel coating. The wound closure assay demonstrated
that PPM1A knockdown cells showed a significantly faster
rate of wound closure compared to control RNAi cells
only when TGF-β1 was present; in the absence of TGF-β1
treatment, there was no significant change compared to the
control cells (Figure 2D). Consistent with these results, the
transwell chamber assay also indicated that with TGF-β1
treatment, PPM1A knockdown significantly increased
BCa cell invasion (Figure 2E). Taken together, these data
indicate that in the presence of TGF-β1, decreased PPM1A
expression significantly promoted BCa cell migration/
invasion in vitro.

of PPM1A). At a postmortem examination conducted
after 39 days, we found that tumors derived from T24
PPM1A RNAi cells grew much faster and weighed
significantly more than those formed from T24 control
cells and PPM1A overexpressing cells (Figure  3A,
Figure  3B). Meanwhile, overexpression of PPM1A
significantly suppressed tumor growth relative to the
growth of T24 PPM1A RNAi cells and vector control
cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, in xenograft tumors
formed from T24 PPM1A RNAi cells, the tumor margin
was not continuous and was even absent in most cases;
as a result, these tumors were more likely to infiltrate
into the surrounding tissue (p < 0.05) (Figure  3D,
Figure 3E).
To further study the role of PPM1A in BCa cell
metastasis in vivo, we injected T24 vector, T24 PPM1A,
T24 RNAi control and T24 PPM1A RNAi cells into
the tail veins of nude mice and compared the resulting
metastatic nodules that formed in the lungs. Seven weeks
after injection, mice injected with PPM1A-knockdown
cells developed significantly more lung metastases
than mice injected with T24 PPM1A and control cells
(Figure 3F, Supplementary Figure 1B). Collectively, our
results indicate that the loss of PPM1A can promote the
tumorigenicity, invasiveness and metastatic potential of
BCa cells in vivo.

Downregulation of PPM1A significantly
promoted cellular growth, invasion and
metastasis in vivo
To investigate the effect of PPM1A expression on
BCa cell growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo, we
xenografted the following cell types into nude mice:
T24 vector, T24 PPM1A (high expression of PPM1A),
T24 control and T24 PPM1A RNAi (low expression

PPM1A reduced TGF-β signaling in BCa cells by
dephosphorylating TGF-β-activated Smad2/3

PPM1A inhibited BCa invasiveness/metastasis
in a TGF-β/Smad-dependent manner

To explore the mechanism that leads to increased
TGF-β-induced transcriptional activities after the
downregulation of PPM1A, we evaluated whether
PPM1A could inhibit TGF-β signaling in T24 and 5637
BCa cells. First, the expression levels of PPM1A related
TGF-β signaling components, including TβRII, TβRI,
Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4, were assessed in these two
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D). PPM1A
RNAi and control RNAi cells were treated with TGF-β1,
and we investigated the temporal pattern of Smad2/3
dephosphorylation. Upon stimulation with TGF-β1,
we found that the levels of phosphorylated Smad2/3
were significantly lower in control cells than in PPM1A
knockdown cells (Figure 4A, Figure 4B). In addition,
we confirmed that the TβRI kinase inhibitor SB431542
could effectively eliminate the increased phosphorylation
of Smad2/3 induced by TGF-β1 in PPM1A-knockdown
cells (Figure 4C). To test whether the downregulation of
PPM1A compromised TGF-β signaling, we measured its
effects on the TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 and CTGF, the
target genes of TGF-β that are widely used and highly
TGF-β responsive, by using real-time PCR analysis.
The induction of PAI-1 and CTGF was very weak and
transient in both cell lines. By comparison, cells with
PPM1A downregulation showed strong induction of PAI1 and CTGF messenger RNA after TGF-β1 stimulation
(Figure 4D). This result suggests that PPM1A can reduce
the level of p-Smad2/3 induced by TGF-β1, and this
effect could be blocked by treatment with a TβRI kinase
inhibitor.

Having shown that PPM1A could suppress cell
migration and invasion and that PPM1A could block
TGF-β signaling by dephosphorylating TGF-β-activated
Smad2/3 in BCa cells, we next sought to investigate
whether the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway mediates
the suppression of invasion driven by PPM1A in BCa.
Migration and invasion assays showed that TGF-β1
treatment promoted cell migration and invasion in PPM1A
RNAi BCa cells, whereas co-treatment with the type I
receptor inhibitor SB431542 significantly abrogated the
pro-migration and invasion effects induced by TGF-β1
in PPM1A knockdown cells (Figure 5A, Figure 5B and
Supplementary Figure 2B). To eliminate possible offtarget effects of SB431542, SD-208, a 2,4-disubstituted
pteridine and ATP-competitive inhibitor of TGF-β
receptor I kinase (TβRI), was used to inhibit TGF-β signal
pathway activation in parallel. Transwell assays showed
that TGF-β1 treatment promoted cell invasion in PPM1Aknockdown BCa cells, and co-treatment with the type I
receptor inhibitors SB431542 or SD-208 consistently
abrogated the cell invasion activities induced by TGF-β1
in PPM1A-knockdown cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
Furthermore, in PPM1A knockdown cells, TGF-β1
treatment led to a significant increase in the expression
of MMP2 and MMP9 in both cell lines, which could also
be prevented by SB431542, as shown by Western blot
and real-time RT-PCR analyses (Figure 5C, Figure 5D).
Taken together, our results suggest that PPM1A inhibits
migration and invasion and that this effect is dependent on
TGF-β/Smad signaling.

Downregulation of PPM1A significantly
promoted TGF-β1-dependent EMT in vitro

TGF-β1-induced EMT of tumor cells in vitro. As such,
PPM1A represents a potential key regulatory factor of
TGF-β1-induced human BCa invasion and EMT.

The EMT is a critical step in TGF-β-induced cancer
cell migration and invasion [19]. Phenotypically, EMT
in response to TGF-β1 signaling is characterized by the
downregulation of epithelial markers and the upregulation
of mesenchymal markers [10]. In this study, we observed
the morphology of PPM1A RNAi and control T24 and
5637 cells, which were treated with TGF-β1 or vehicle,
by fluorescence microscopy. We found that while T24 and
5627 cells grew as tightly packed colonies characteristic
of epithelial cells and showed flattened spreading,
PPM1A RNAi cells treated with TGF-β1 were spindleshaped, showed active spreading and had lost the majority
of their cell-cell contacts (Supplementary Figure  2A).
Consistent with these observations, we found that only
in the presence of TGF-β1, PPM1A knockdown led to
a significant reduction in the expression of CK19 and
E-cadherin and increased the expression of Vimentin
in both cell lines. Additionally, these effects were
prevented by treatment with the SB431542, as shown by
Western blot and real-time RT-PCR analysis (Figure 5E,
Figure 5F). These results suggest that upon activation of
TGF-β signaling induced by PPM1A, cells exhibit a more
overt EMT, which may contribute to the formation of more
aggressive and metastatic tumors. These results indicated
that the reduced expression of PPM1A promoted the

Correlations between PPM1A and biomarkers
related to the TGF-β signaling pathway and
tumor invasion in BCa samples
To verify the in vitro and in vivo results reported
above, we performed immunohistochemical staining for
PPM1A and biomarkers related to the TGF-β signaling
pathway and cell invasiveness, metastasis and EMT
in 145 BCa samples. Representative immunostaining
of PPM1A and the associated positive biomarkers is
shown in Figure 6A. In the BCa samples, we observed
that the loss of PPM1A expression was significantly
correlated with high p-Smad2/3 expression (p < 0.001),
but there was no statistically significant association with
Smad2/3 (p = 0.311) (Supplementary Table 3). Pearson’s
correlation analysis showed that decreased PPM1A was
significantly correlated with elevated MMP2 (p = 0.000),
MMP9 (p = 0.029) and the loss of PPM1A expression was
significantly correlated with low E-cadherin expression
(p  = 0.000) (Figure 6A, Figure 6B and Supplementary
Table 3). However, we found that there were no significant
correlations between PPM1A and Ki67, CK19 or Vimentin
(Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with our previous
in vitro and in vivo results, these correlations between

dephosphorylating TGF-β-activated Smad2/3 [15].
PPM1A belongs to the PP2C phosphatase family
and specifically interacts with and dephosphorylates
phosphorylated substrates. Several kinases, including p38
and MAPK [32], CDK9 [33], PI3K [34], and NF-kB [35],
have been identified to be substrates of PPM1A. However,
the distinct functions of PPM1A activity and how PPM1A
regulates tumor cell activity remain largely unknown. This
study describes the functions of PPM1A in the progression
of BCa and highlights the potential roles of PPM1A in
BCa cell migration, invasion and EMT induced by
TGF-β1. We evaluated the expression status of PPM1A in
BCa tissue samples and found that PPM1A is a prognostic
factor that is especially associated with the development
of tumor invasion in bladder cancer patients.
PPM1A has a large number of substrates and exhibits
distinct functions in different cell types and contexts.
However, how PPM1A regulated during tumor invasion
remains to be elucidated. In our study, we found that
knockdown of PPM1A has little effect on cell migration
and invasiveness, but when PPM1A-knockdown BCa
cells are administered TGF-β1 treatment, cell migration
and invasiveness are significantly enhanced compared to
control cells. Based on these investigations, we conclude
that knockdown of endogenous PPM1A sensitizes
cell migration and invasion to respond to TGF-β1. We
further established a subcutaneous xenotransplantation
BCa model and lung metastasis model. Consistent
with our in vitro results, significant reductions in tumor
growth and metastasis were observed following PPM1A
overexpression.

DISCUSSION
There are two subtypes of bladder urothelial
carcinomas, superficial and muscle-invasive cancers,
which are distinguished according to whether the tumor
infiltration extends to the muscular bladder wall [20]. BCa
carries a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis due to
muscle invasion and metastasis [21]. TGF-β is believed
to contribute to carcinoma development through the
promotion of metastasis and induction of the EMT [7].
We previously reported that Ski, as a negative regulator of
TGF-β signaling, suppresses cell invasion and metastasis
[22]. Cumulative investigations showed that blockade of
TGF-β signaling using inhibitors significantly suppresses
tumor invasiveness and metastasis [23-26]. In BCa, it
has been demonstrated that the serum level and tissue
expression of TGF-β1 is significantly elevated [27, 28],
and increased levels of TGF-β in patients with bladder
cancer have significant prognostic value for highly
aggressive metastatic disease and are considered a poor
prognosis marker [8, 29].
The activity of the TGF-β-initiated signaling
pathway is under tight control by the level of activated
R-Smads [30, 31]. PPM1A has recently been reported
to act as an antagonist of TGF-β signaling by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

5706

Oncotarget

Smads possess intrinsic nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling capacity, which enables them to transmit TGF-β
signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus; when
these activated pathways are terminated, the majority
of activated R-Smads are not degraded, but recycled
[36]. Dai et al. recently discovered that the first step in
the termination of nuclear Smad signaling is initiated
by PPM1A, which dephosphorylates Smad2/3 in the
nucleus [37], and that dephosphorylation is a prerequisite
for the recycling of R-Smads [38]. PPM1A has been
demonstrated to physically interact with p-Smad2 and
p-Smad3 [15]. Here, we present studies on PPM1Amediated dephosphorylation of p-Smad2/3 in BCa cell
lines. We found that upon stimulation with TGF-β1,
the levels of phosphorylated Smad2/3 are significantly
higher and sustained in PPM1A knockdown cells than in
control cells. We further found that cells downregulated
for PPM1A show strong induction of PAI-1 and CTGF
mRNA after TGF-β1 stimulation. In the BCa samples,
we observed that the loss of PPM1A expression was
significantly correlated with high p-Smad2/3 expression.
All of these results lead to the conclusion that PPM1A
inhibits the TGF-β-induced the activity of Smad2,
Smad3 and transcriotional responses, whereas depletion
of PPM1A enhances the activation of TGF-β/Smads
signaling in BCa cells.
Previous studies have shown that lower expression
of PPM1A is involved in human cytotrophoblast cell
invasion and migration [16, 39] and that decreased PPM1A
expression inhibits prostate cancer metastases [35]. Our
studies demonstrate that the TGF-β signaling pathway is
essential for PPM1A to prevent invasion and metastasis
of BCa. In addition to TGF-β1 treatment resulting in a
significant effect on migration and invasiveness in vitro,
we found that co-treatment withthe inhibitors of TβRI
(SB431542) significantly abrogated the pro-migration and
invasion effects of PPM1A downregulation.
One mechanism by which TGF-β contributes to
cancer progression is through induction of the EMT,
which is a critical step in TGF-β-induced cancer cell
migration and invasion [40, 41]. This process involves
the disaggregation of structured epithelial units to enable
cell motility and morphogenesis during embryonic
development and has also attracted attention in studies of
tumor progression [42, 43] [44]. One of our most notable
observations was that PPM1A RNAi cells treated with
TGF-β1 showed a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore,
with TGF-β1 stimulation, PPM1A knockdown led to a
significant reduction in the expression of epithelial markers
and increased expression of mesenchymal markers in both
cell lines, and these effects were prevented by treatment
with SB431542, suggesting that upon activation of TGF-β
signaling induced by loss of PPM1A, cells exhibit a more
overt EMT, which may contribute to the formation of
more aggressive and metastatic tumors.

The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family is
known to degrade nearly all components of the ECM.
MMP-2 and MMP-9, the most extensively studied MMPs
in tumor invasion, mainly degrade collagen IV and a
number of other ECM proteins [45, 46]. We found that
in PPM1A-knockdown BCa cells, TGF-β1 treatment
induced a significant increase in the expression of MMP2
and MMP9, which could also be prevented by SB431542.
In our study, we further found significant correlations
between PPM1A expression and MMP2, MMP9 and
E-Cadherin in BCa samples. These findings are consistent
with our previous observations from in vitro and in vivo
studies.
In the present study, we revealed a previously
unrecognized role for the protein phosphatase PPM1A in
BCa, serving as a modifier of TGF-β signaling through
control of the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Additionally,
PPM1A was shown to suppress BCa cell migration,
invasion and EMT development and this effect was
dependent on TGF-β/Smad signaling. Furthermore, loss
of PPM1A expression correlated with poor differentiation,
the development of muscle-invasive tumors and poor
prognosis in patients with BCa. Therefore, our findings
suggest a notable tumor-promoting role for PPM1A that is
dependent on the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in BCa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and clinical specimens
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were
collected from 145 BCa patients. These patients were
enrolled from January 2005 to December 2008 at the
Department of Urology at the Tenth People’s Hospital,
which is affiliated with the Tongji University of Medicine
(41 tumors), and the Department of Pathology of Huashan
Hospital, which is affiliated with Fudan University
(104 tumors) (ShangHai, China). All tissue samples were
cut into 3-μm-thick sections, which were subsequently
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Two experienced
pathologists confirmed the diagnosis of “urothelial
carcinoma of the bladder” for all specimens. None of the
patients had received neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy.

Cell lines and mice
The human BCa cell lines SW780, UM-UC-3,
J82, 5637 and T24 were used in this study. The cell lines
SW780, UM-UC-3, and J82 were obtained from the cell
bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and 5637 and
T24 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The cells were grown in complete growth
medium, as recommended by the manufacturer. Cultured
cells were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37 °C. All of the cell lines were regularly authenticated

by checking their morphology and were tested for the
absence of mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert,
Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA).
Male BALB/c-nu mice (4–5 weeks of age, 18–20 g)
were obtained from the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and housed in laminar
flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions
with food and water provided ad libitum. All of the mouse
experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH
guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The study protocol was also approved by the Committee
on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research,
Fudan University, Shanghai.

San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. All transfections were carried out using
the Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, USA).

Wound closure assays
The cells were plated in the wells of 6-well plates.
Confluent cell monolayers were wounded by manually
drawing a furrow across the monolayer with a 10-μl
pipette tip. The cell culture medium was then replaced
with fresh medium, and 200 pM TGF-β1 or vehicle was
added as required. Wound closure was then monitored
at various time points by phase contrast microscopy.
The wound area at each time point after wounding was
quantified using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe
Systems Inc.) and Image version 1.29 (NIH) software. The
experiments were performed in duplicate.

Reagents
Human recombinant TGF-β1 was obtained from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The TGF-β RI (TβRI)
kinase inhibitor SB431542 was obtained from Millipore
(Billerica, MA), and SD-208 was purchased from Sigma
(St Louis, MO). The following antibodies were used in
this study: anti-PPM1A, anti-MMP2, anti-MMP9, antiSmad2, anti-Smad3, anti-phosphorylated Smad2 and
anti-phosphorylated Smad3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA) as well as anti-E-cadherin, anti-GAPDH,
anti-CK19, anti-phosphorylated Smad2/3 and anti-Vim
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). SB431542 was applied during
the TGF-β1 perfusion.

Invasion assay
Cell invasion was assessed using the transwell
chamber invasion assay (Matrigel-coated membrane,
BD Biosciences) with 24-well transwell units with
polycarbonate filters (pore size 8 mm) coated on the upper
side with 1% gelatin (Sigma). Cells (1 × 105) were seeded
in serum-free medium into the upper chamber and allowed
to invade into the lower chamber, which contained 10%
FCS as a chemoattractant. TGF-β1 (200 pM) or vehicle
alone was added to the upper and lower chambers. After
48 h, cells that had invaded through the Matrigel matrix and
adhered to the underside of the membrane were counted.

Lentivirus-mediated PPM1A RNA interference
We established stable, PPM1A-silenced T24 and
5637 transfectants by infecting cells with lentivirus
encoding shPPM1A (purchased from GenePharma,
Shanghai, China). The lentivirus packaging shRNA
expression vector was established as previously reported
[47]. Briefly, the sequences for targeting the PPM1A gene
(GenBank accession no. NM_021003) were selected using
the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Then, three short hairpin RNA oligonucleotides were
designed (RNAi #1: 5’-GTCGACACCTGTTTGTATA-3’;
RNAi #2: 5’-CTGGGATGTTATGGGAAAT-3’; RNAi #3:
5’-GCTGTGAGCATTTGTTAGA-3’) and cloned into the
pGLV-U6-GFP lentivirus vector (GenePharma, Shanghai,
China). The negative control vector contained a nonsense
shRNA (5’- TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3’) to control
for any non-RNAi-mediated effects. T24 and 5637 cells
were exposed to lentivirus-containing supernatant for 24 h
in the presence of polybrene (Sigma). Stable transfectants
were selected with puromycin (2 mg/ml) and verified by
Western blotting and real-time PCR analysis.

Xenograft studies
Briefly, mice were randomly divided into four
groups consisting of six mice each. Cells (5x106 cells
in 200 μl) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and
injected subcutaneously into the flank of each BALB/c
nude mouse. The length and width of the resulting
tumors (in millimeters) were measured every three days
with calipers. The tumor diameter was measured, and
the volume (length × width2 × 0.52) was calculated. The
mice were sacrificed humanely on day 40, and the tumors
were dissected and weighed. Then, the tumors were fixed,
embedded and cut into 3-μm-thick sections, which were
subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin to permit
observation of the tumor margin. Immunohistochemistry
was also performed on these sections.

In vivo metastasis assay
Male nude mice received intravenous injections of
2 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of normal saline via the tail vein.
Seven weeks after injection, the mice were examined
grossly at necropsy for the presence of metastases in

the lungs. We evaluated tumor metastasis by counting
the number of metastatic colonies in one histologic
section from the midportion of each lung sample from
each mouse. In particular, we calculated the ratio of the
metastatic area to the total area in histologic sections
from the midportion of each lung [48]. The ratio of the
metastatic area to the total area in a histologic section was
calculated using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe
Systems Inc.) and Image version 1.29 (NIH) software.

significance was evaluated by the log-rank test. The
correlation of PPM1A immunoreactivity with the patients’
clinicopathological variables was analyzed using Fisher’s
exact test. Differences were considered significant at
p < 0.05.

Specimens of tumor tissue were fixed in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Three-micrometer
sections were then cut from the paraffin blocks for
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The sections
were stained with anti-PPM1A (1:200), anti-E-Cadherin
(1:100), anti-CK19 (1:500), anti-Vimentin (1:100),
anti-MMP2 (1:100) and anti-MMP9 (1:100) antibodies
at 4°C overnight. The secondary antibody and avidinbiotin peroxidase complex method was used according
to the standard protocols provided by the manufacturer
(Vector Laboratories, CA). An immunoglobulin-negative
control was used to rule out non-specific binding.
These procedures were performed by two independent
investigators and one pathologist who were blinded to the
model/treatment type for the series of specimens.
