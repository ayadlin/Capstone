ABSTRACT
A major problem in patients with multiple myeloma is chemotherapy resistance,
which develops in myeloma cells upon interaction with bone marrow stromal cells.
However, few studies have determined the role of bone marrow adipocytes, a major
component of stromal cells in the bone marrow, in myeloma chemotherapy resistance.
We reveal that mature human adipocytes activate autophagy and upregulate the
expression of autophagic proteins, thereby suppressing chemotherapy-induced
caspase cleavage and apoptosis in myeloma cells. We found that adipocytes secreted
known and novel adipokines, such as leptin and adipsin. The addition of these
adipokines enhanced the expression of autophagic proteins and reduced apoptosis in
myeloma cells. In vivo studies further demonstrated the importance of bone marrowderived adipocytes in the reduced response of myeloma cells to chemotherapy. Our
findings suggest that adipocytes, adipocyte-secreted adipokines, and adipocyteactivated autophagy are novel targets for combatting chemotherapy resistance and
enhancing treatment efficacy in myeloma patients.

INTRODUCTION

of BMSCs, including macrophages [11, 12], plasmacytoid
dendritic cells [13], osteoblasts [14, 15], osteoclasts [1517], and immune cells [18], have been identified. These
cells produce many cytokines that support MM growth
and survival [19, 20]. However, the role of other types of
BMSCs is unclear.
Adipocytes, which arise from mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs), are a major type of BMSCs [21-23] and
the primary composes of adipose tissue. The adipocytes
in white adipose tissue (WAT) contain a single large
membrane-enclosed lipid droplet, surrounded by a thin
rim of cytoplasm [24], and express specific proteins such
as adipocyte protein 2 (aP2); they produce triglycerol [25]
and adipokines [26-28], and serve as a major source of
energy reserve [29]. The adipocytes in brown adipose
tissue (BAT) contain a central nucleus and many small lipid

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a
clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells [1]. It is
the second most common hematological malignancy in
the United States [2, 3]. With conventional treatment,
the median survival duration is 3-4 years; advanced
chemotherapy may extend this duration to 5-7 years or
longer [4, 5]. However, most patients rapidly develop
relapsed or refractory disease after undergoing highdose chemotherapy [6, 7]. Thus, strategies to overcome
chemotherapy resistance in MM patients are urgently
needed.
Recent studies show that the interaction between
MM cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)
induces chemotherapy resistance [8-10]. Several cell types

droplets and mitochondria, and provide a vital source of
heat to maintain body temperature. Yellow adipose tissue
(YAT) has a mixed characterization and gene expression
pattern of WAT and BAT. Recent studies categorize bone
marrow (BM) fat as a YAT, with the abilities to initiate
osteogenesis and provide energy in emergency situations
[30]. In addition, an association between adipocytes
and cancer was reported: in ovarian cancer, adipocytes
promote rapid cancer cell proliferation; in breast cancer
and leukemia, they induce tumor metastasis and inhibit
apoptosis [31, 32]. Clinical studies showed an association
between BM adipocytes and an increased risk of MM,
although its specific biological mechanisms have yet to
be elucidated [33, 34]. Adipocytes isolated from femoral
BM biopsies support MM cell proliferation and migration
[35]. However, no studies have determined the role of BM
adipocytes in MM chemotherapy resistance.
Autophagy is a non-selective lysosomal pathway
that degrades cytosolic organelles and proteins with highly
regulated processes, in which the organelles and portions
of cytosol are sequestered inside autophagosomes,
the double-membrane vesicles, and translocated to
lysosomes for fusion and content degradation. Autophagy
was recently shown to play an important role in tumor
development [36]. Some studies show that autophagy
activation causes tumor cell death in cooperation with
apoptosis [37]. Others found that autophagy reduces
apoptosis by inhibiting caspase cleavage [38], suggesting

a functional role in inducing cancer chemotherapy
resistance. Previous studies showed that it counteracted
apoptosis in MM cells, which were exposed to
chemotherapy drugs in vitro, by regulating intracellular
reactive oxygen species. However, the mechanism of
autophagy activation in MM cells remains unclear. In
this study, we determined the role of BM adipocytes in
MM chemotherapy resistance in vitro and in MM mouse
models. We revealed, for the first time, that adipocytes
protect MM cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
via autophagy activation. Adipocytes upregulated the
expression of autophagic proteins in MM cells via known
adipocyte-secreted adipokines, leading to suppression
of caspase cleavage and apoptosis in MM cells. Thus,
we found that adipocytes in the BM, adipocyte-secreted
adipokines, and adipocyte-activated autophagy are novel
therapeutic targets for preventing MM chemotherapy
resistance.

RESULTS
In vitro generation of BM-derived mature human
adipocytes
Human MSCs were derived from BM mononuclear
cells from the human fetal bones of five healthy donors

Figure 1: Characterization of cultured, BM-derived mature human adipocytes. MSCs were derived from the BM

mononuclear cells of healthy human fetal bones. (A) Flow cytometry analysis shows the immunophenotype of MSCs, which express
the MSC-specific surface markers CD44, CD90, and CD166 but not the hematopoietic, stem cell, or endothelial protein markers CD14,
CD34, and CD45. Mature adipocytes were generated from MSCs in a 2-week culture in adipocyte medium. (B) Shown is a mature human
MSC-derived adipocyte at high magnification (x60) (indicated by a blue arrow); it contained large amounts of lipid droplets (indicated

BM-derived adipocytes protect MM cells from
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis

or pre-adipocyte cell line PCS-210-010 (data not shown).
The immunophenotype of MSCs included CD44, CD90,
and CD166 but not the hematopoietic, stem cell, or
endothelial markers CD14, CD34, and CD45 (Figure
1A), as determined using flow cytometry analysis.
Culturing the MSCs in adipocyte medium for 2 weeks
induced mature adipocyte formation, whereas culturing
them in MSC medium did not. The generated mature
adipocytes contained large amounts of lipid droplets
in the cytoplasm, as detected with Oil Red O staining
(Figure 1B); produced high levels of soluble triglycerol,
as determined by a BODIPY assay (Figure 1C); and
expressed the specific adipocyte differentiation-associated
protein aP2, as determined by flow cytometry (Figure
1D); the undifferentiated cells did not. To avoid trace
undifferentiated cell effects, the mature adipocytes were
further purified for the studies below.

To determine whether BM-derived adipocytes
have a functional role in chemotherapy-induced MM
cell apoptosis, we seeded ARP-1 cells, without or with
adipocytes, at a ratio of 5:1 in medium; different doses of
melphalan were added for 24 hours. Compared with the
ARP-1 cell culture alone, cells co-cultured with adipocytes
had a much lower percentage of apoptosis (Figure 2A).
Similarly, co-culture with adipocytes inhibited apoptosis
in U266 (Figure 2B) or ARP-1 (Figure 2C) cells induced
by melphalan or bortezomib. Increasing adipocyte
numbers in the co-cultures had an increased ability in
a dose-dependent manner to reduce apoptosis of MM
cells U266 (Figure 2D) and ARP-1 (Figure 2E) induced
by melphalan. Co-culture with MM patients’ adipocytes
(Figure 2F and 2G), adult adipocytes (Figure 2H), or WAT
cells (Figure 2I) offers the protection as well.
Previous studies showed that adipocytes that

histograms show the percentages of apoptotic ARP-1 cells in 24-hour co-cultures, without or with adipocytes at a ratio of 5:1 in medium
with melphalan (0, 12.5, 25, or 50 µM). Summarized data are shown in (B) for U266 cells and (C) for ARP-1 cells treated with melphalan
or bortezomib. Also shown are the percentages of apoptotic U266 (D) and ARP-1 (E) cells, cultured alone (no adipocytes) or with mature
adipocytes at a ratio of 20:1, 5:1, or 1:1 for 24 hours. Apoptotic cells were detected using an Annexin V-binding assay. Mature adipocytes
were generated from the MSCs derived from the BM mononuclear cells of three healthy human fetal bones (A-E) Similar experiments were
done co-culture of U266 cells (F) or ARP-1 cells (G) with mature adipocytes isolated from bone marrow aspirate of three MM patients at
a ratio of 5:1 for 24 hours, as well as with adipocytes isolated from adult BM aspirates (aADs; H) or from WAT cells (WAT; I). Results of
five independent experiments are shown. **P < 0.01.

are in direct contact with tumor cells can transfer
energy-containing lipids into the cells to promote their
proliferation [32]. To determine whether adipocytes
inhibit MM cell apoptosis by coming into direct contact
with MM cells, we co-cultured MM cells and adipocytes
and separated them, using transwell inserts [39], in a
medium containing melphalan. The MM cells were still
protected from the apoptotic effects of melphalan (Figure
3A). Previous studies also showed that adipocytes can
take up drugs, thereby decreasing the drugs’ effects on
tumor cells [40]. To avoid the possibility that adipocytes
inhibit MM cell apoptosis by absorbing drugs, we cultured
purified adipocytes for 24 hours, collected the adipocyteconditioned media, and added the adipocyte-conditioned
media plus melphalan to the MM cell culture. Because the
culture had no adipocytes, no drug absorption occurred.
Our results showed that MM cells were still protected
against melphalan treatment (Figure 3A). We cultured
other MM cell lines (Figure 3B) and primary MM cells

isolated from the BM aspirates of six MM patients
(Figure 3C) in medium with adipocyte-conditioned
media. Culturing MM cells with adipocyte-conditioned
media protected them from the treatments of melphalan,
bortezomib, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin (Figure
3D). Western blot analysis further showed that melphalan
treatment enhanced the levels of cleaved caspase-9 and
-3, but not -8, and PARP in U266 and ARP-1 cells, while
the addition of adipocyte-conditioned media significantly
reduced melphalan (Figure 3E) or bortezomib (Figure 3F)induced caspase-9, -3, and PARP cleavage.

Adipocytes activate autophagy and inhibit
apoptosis in MM cells
Previous studies showed that autophagy activation
inhibits caspase cleavage, inducing chemotherapy
resistance in many tumors. Thus, we determined whether

bones. Results of five independent experiments are shown. *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01. Western blot analysis shows the reduced levels of cleaved

adipocytes activate autophagy in MM cells. U266 and
ARP-1 cells were cultured in medium, with or without
adipocyte-conditioned media, and the MDC assay was
used to detect autophagy. We observed a significant
increase in autophagy in adipocyte-conditioned mediatreated MM cells but little autophagy in non-treated cells
(Figure 4A and 4B). Western blot analysis further showed
that the addition of the adipocyte-conditioned media
significantly upregulated the expression of the autophagy
proteins Atg3, Atg5, and LC3-I/II but not Beclin-1 (Figure
4C). The addition of conditioned media of adipocytes
generated from the pre-adipocyte line (Figure 4A-C) or
primary MSCs of five healthy human fetal bones (data
not shown) had a similar effect. To determine whether
adipocyte-induced autophagy mediates adipocytes’
protection of MM cells from apoptosis, we added
specific inhibitors against autophagy 3-methyladenine or

chloroquine to the MM cell culture containing adipocyteconditioned media in presence or absence of melphalan or
BTZ. Treatment with both inhibitors reduced autophagy
(Figure 4D), and enhanced PARP cleavage and apoptosis
in melphalan (Figure 4E and 4F) or BTZ (Figure 4G and
4H) treated U266 (Figure 4E and 4G) and ARP-1 cells
(Figure 4F and 4H), even in adipocyte-conditioned media.
Atg5 is a key protein which is required for autophagy
activation. Thus, we knocked down Atg5 expression in
ARP-1 and U266 cells using Atg5 shRNAs (Figure 4I;
upper panels). Cultures of non-target shRNA-, but not
Atg5 shRNA-MM cells, with adipocyte-conditioned
media inhibited melphalan-induced apoptosis (Figure
4I; lower panels), indicating that autophagy mediates
adipocyte protection.

Adipocytes produce soluble adipokines that
increase the expression of autophagy proteins

cultured MSCs and the purified mature adipocytes
generated from MSCs, and determined adipokine
expression and secretion using quantitative RT-PCR
(Figure 5B) and ELISA (Figure 5C-5D). Our results
showed that adipokines such as leptin and adipsin were
produced mainly by adipocytes, whereas other adipokines,
such as interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant
protein (MCP)-1, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and macrophage
inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, were produced by both
adipocytes and MSCs. To determine whether adipokines
activate autophagy, we added recombinant adipsin and
leptin, which are adipocyte derived, to MM cell cultures.

We elucidated the mechanism by which adipocytes
activate autophagy. We first analyzed adipocyte-secreted
soluble factors using an array containing specific
antibodies against 62 adipokines that are known to
be produced by adipocytes. Culture medium and the
supernatants from MSCs or fibroblasts served as controls.
We observed the adipokines highly presented in the
supernatant of the adipocytes (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
we collected the mRNAs and conditioned media of

Figure 5: Adipocytes produce adipokines that activate autophagy. (A) Representative images of arrays show the profile of

adipokine expression in the supernatants of cultured adipocytes. Medium and the supernatants from cultured MSCs or fibroblasts served
as controls. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to determine the adipocyte-expressed (B) and ELISA to determine the adipocytesecreted adipsin (C) and leptin (D), and the expression and secretion in MSCs served as controls. (E) Western blot analysis shows the
increased expression of the autophagy proteins Atg3 and LC3-I/II and unchanged β-actin in U266 cells in 24-hour culture in medium with
adipocyte-conditioned media (AD-CM) or the adipokines adipsin (100 ng/ml) or leptin (25 ng/ml). Neutralizing antibodies against adipsin
(2 µg/ml) or leptin (2 µg/ml), alone or in combination, were added to U266 cells in medium with adipocyte-CM. Addition of isotype IgG
served as control. (F) Western blot analysis shows the reduced expression of the autophagy proteins Atg3 and LC3-I/II in U266 cells treated
with the neutralizing antibodies. Antibody combination had a synergistic reduction in the autophagy protein expression as compared with
treatment alone. (G) Annexin V-binding assay showed the percentage of apoptotic U266 cells in cultures with melphalan, and with or

The addition of IL-6, which is both adipocyte and MSC
derived, served as a control. Western blot analysis results
showed that the addition enhanced the expression of Atg3
and LC3-I/II in MM cells (Figure 5E). Moreover, antiadipsin or anti-leptin antibodies, alone or in combination,
or control IgG, were added to U266 cells in medium
with adipocyte-conditioned media. Our results showed
the reduced Atg3 and LC3-I/II in U266 cells treated with
either anti-leptin or anti-adipsin antibody. Addition of both
antibodies had a synergistic effect as compared with the
antibody alone (Figure 5F). Culture with leptin or adipsin
protected MM cells against melphalan-induced apoptosis
(Figure 5G), and addition of anti-leptin and/or anti-adipsin
antibodies reduced adipocyte-induced protection (Figure
5H).

the effects of adipocytes on Jak/Stat3 activation, we added
adipocyte-conditioned media, leptin, or adipsin to cultures
of ARP-1 and U266 cells. No addition of adipocyteconditioned media (Medium) served as a control.
Western blot analysis results showed that the addition
of adipocyte-conditioned media upregulated the levels
of pStat3 and pJak1 in a time-dependent manner (Figure
6A). Addition of leptin or adipsin could also upregulated
pStat3 levels (Figure 6B), while blocking leptin or adipsin
by neutralizing antibodies reduced pStat3 levels (Figure
6C). The levels of non-phosphorylated kinases and β-actin
protein were unchanged. Furthermore, the addition of a
specific inhibitor against Stat3 to the MM cell culture
containing adipocyte-conditioned media reduced the
expression of the autophagy proteins Atg3 and LC3-I/
II (Figure 6D) and enhanced melphalan (Figure 6E) or
bortezomib (Figure 6F)-induced apoptosis in MM cells.

Adipocytes activate MM cell autophagy via Jak/
Stat3 signaling

Adipocytes protect MM cells from chemotherapy
and reduce MM cell apoptosis in vivo

We determined which signaling pathway mediates
adipokine-activated autophagy. We focused on Jak/
Stat3 because many adipokines, such as leptin, activate
signaling in MM cells and this signaling has been shown to
support MM cell proliferation and survival. To determine

adipocytes (generated from pre-adipocyte PCS-210-010),
directly into the femurs of SCID mice. Two weeks later,
the mice were intraperitoneally injected with melphalan,
twice a week, for a total of four injections. Mouse BM
cells (including the MM cells, the injected GFP-labeled
adipocytes, and the unlabeled murine BMSCs) were
flushed out. Our results showed that after melphalan
treatment, the mouse femurs co-injected with MM cells
and adipocytes had larger numbers of CD138+ cells; this
reflects the MM tumor burdens in these mice, compared
with those in mice injected with MM cells alone (Figure

7A). After anti-CD138 antibody sorting, the CD138+ cells
were subjected to an annexin V-binding assay to assess
apoptosis, to a MDC assay to assess autophagy, and to
a Western blot analysis to assess Stat3 phosphorylation
in MM cells. We found a lower percentage of apoptosis
(Figure 7B), higher percentage of autophagy (Figure
7C), and upregulated levels of pStat3 (Figure 7D) in
CD138+ MM cells from mice injected with MM cells and
adipocytes than from those injected with MM cells only.
The CD138- cells were labeled with anti-GFP
antibody, and the GFP+ cells were counted by flow

antibody. The percentages of human CD138+ cells are shown in (A). The cells were further sorted by anti-human CD138-coated magnetic
beads. An aliquot of CD138+ cells was examined with the annexin V-binding assay for apoptosis, and the percentages of apoptotic cells are

and the levels of phosphorylated (p) Stat3 are shown in (D). In addition, the aliquot of CD138− cells was labeled with anti-GFP antibody

cytometry to assess the injected GFP-labeled human
adipocytes. We only observed GFP+ cells in mice injected
with human adipocytes. There was no difference in
GFP+ cell numbers between melphalan-treated mice
and PBS-treated mice (Figure 7E). Moreover, flow
cytometry analysis showed the expression of human
aP2 in the GFP+ cells (Figure 7F), and ELISA showed
the secretion of human leptin and adipsin in the serum
of mice injected with human adipocytes (Figure 7G),
indicating that the injected adipocytes are functional in the
BM. To validate the status of adiposity and tumor burden
in BM, the mouse femurs were collected at week 2 and
week 4 (after cell injection). Perilipin is a lipid droplet
coat protein and a marker for adipocytes. The femurs
were immunohistochemically stained with anti–perilipin
antibody for adipocytes, or with anti-CD138 antibody
for MM cells. Perilipin+ cells were present in the BM of
mice injected with human adipocytes (Figure 7H). There
was no change in perilipin+ cell numbers between week
2 and week 4, with increased numbers of CD138+ cells at
week 4 (Figure 7H). Furthermore, radiography was used
to examine bone lesion in mouse femurs at week 4. In
untreated mice, there was little difference of bone lesion
in MM-bearing mice with and without adipocytes. With
melphalan treatment, more bone lesions were observed in
MM-bearing mice with adipocytes than the one without
adipocytes (Figure 7I). In the xenograft subcutaneous
MM mouse models, with melphalan treatment, more
tumor volumes were observed in MM-bearing mice with
adipocytes than the one without adipocytes (Figure 7J).
Taken together, the mouse studies reveal that adipocytes
support MM growth and induce chemotherapy resistance
in vivo.

are mainly produced by adipocytes, such as leptin and
adipsin; others are produced by either adipocytes or other
BMSCs. A previous study showed that MM cells expressed
a leptin receptor, and BM adipocytes secreted leptin.
Addition of leptin resulted in a minor increase of MM cell
proliferation in vitro [35]. Our study discovered a novel
impact of adipocyte-secreted leptin in MM chemotherapy
resistance. However, the role of other adipokines, such
as adipsin, in MM pathogenesis is unknown. Adipsin is
involved in the alternative complement pathway of the
complement system. It is a serine protease that stimulates
glucose transport for triglyceride accumulation in fat
cells and inhibits lipolysis; its levels are elevated in the
obese people. In our study, the adipocyte-secreted adipsin
inhibited chemotherapy-induced MM cell apoptosis,
suggesting a novel mechanism by which adipocytes
induce chemotherapy resistance via secreted known and
novel soluble adipokines.
Autophagy plays a dual role in tumor development:
while autophagy can cause tumor cell death;[36] it can
also support tumor cell survival and induce chemotherapy
resistance.[41, 42] Recent studies show that activation of
autophagy contributes to carfilzomib resistance in MM
through AMPK-dependent autophagosome formation.
[43] In addition, KLF4-SQSTM1/p62-mediated autophagy
resists against bortezomib treatment [44], and inhibition
of autophagy overcomes the resistance.[45] Our study
revealed that adipocytes induced autophagy activation
via derived adipokines; adipocyte-activated autophagy
is a novel mechanism of MM chemotherapy resistance.
We demonstrated that adipsin and leptin upregulate
autophagic protein expression. Autophagy inhibition
counteracted adipocytes’ inhibition of caspase cleavage
and apoptosis in MM cells. Recent studies show regulation
of autophagy by several signaling pathways. Interaction
of Akt/mTOR or Bcl-2 with Beclin-1 suppresses the
accumulation of autophagy proteins, but JNK and NFκB bind to the promoters of Beclin-1 and LC3-I/II and
transcriptionally regulate gene expression. We revealed
an additional pathway by which Jak/Stat3 signaling,
activated by adipocyte-secreted adipokines, upregulated
the expression of LC3-I/II, Atg3, and Atg5 but not
Beclin-1. Stat3 inhibitors disrupted adipocyte-induced
autophagy activation. However, the mechanism by which
Stat3 regulates autophagy protein expression needs further
investigation. Our results indicate that BM adipocytes,
adipokines, and adipocyte-activated autophagy are novel
targets for combatting chemotherapy resistance. We can
also broaden our research with additional chemotherapy
drugs, such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, to enhance
the efficacy of current treatment and improve the overall
outcomes in MM patients.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we elucidated a novel mechanism
of MM chemotherapy resistance. We revealed that
adipocytes, a BMSC that heavily infiltrates MM patients’
BM, are important in the induction of chemotherapy
resistance.
Recent studies show that direct tumor cell-adipocyte
contact leads to lipids transferring from adipocytes
to tumor cells via aP2, where they provide energy to
tumor cells. In this study, the separation of MM cells
and adipocytes using the transwell inserts in the coculture did not significantly reduce adipocytes’ protective
effects against drug-induced apoptosis. In addition,
adipocytes have been shown to take up drugs, decreasing
the drugs’ efficacy at killing tumor cells [40]. We found
that the addition of adipocyte-conditioned media had
a protective effect, indicating that adipocytes inhibited
MM cell apoptosis at least partly via soluble factors. In
the conditioned media of adipocytes generated from BMderived primary MSCs or a pre-adipocyte cell line, we
observed soluble cytokines and adipokines: some of these

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Lentiviral infection of MM cells with shorthairpin RNA (shRNA)

Reagents and antibodies

MM cells were infected by lentivirus containing
non-target shRNA or human Atg5 shRNA (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stable cell lines
were selected with 0.7 µg/ml of puromycin (SigmaAldrich) for 4 weeks.

Unless otherwise stated, BODIPY 493/503 from Life
Technologies, chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich, antibodies
for flow cytometry analysis from BD Biosciences, and
antibodies for Western blot analysis from Cell Signaling
Technology, were purchased.

Identification of adipokines in culture medium by
an array and ELISA

MM Cell lines and primary MM cells

The supernatants (as conditioned media) were
collected from cultures of MSCs, fibroblasts (ATCC),
or adipocytes in serum-free DMEM medium for 24
hours. The array (Raybio Human Obesity Array C1 kit;
RayBiotech, GA) was incubated with conditioned media
and analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The levels of adipokines in conditioned media were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Inc.).

ARP-1 and ARK cells were kindly provided by
Arkansas Cancer Research Center, AR. Others were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Primary MM cells were isolated from BM
aspirates of MM patients using anti-CD138 antibodycoated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.). Cells were
maintained in RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). This study was approved by the institutional
review board of The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center (Houston, Texas).

Apoptosis assay

In vitro generation, isolation, and characterization
of human MSCs and mature adipocytes

An annexin V-binding assay was used to detect cell
apoptosis, according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and analyzed by a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer.

BM cells were flushed out from human fetal femoral
bones (Advanced Bioscience Resources), and cultured
in DMEM to generate MSCs [46]. Immunophenotyping
of MSCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. To generate
mature adipocytes, MSCs were cultured in adipocyte
medium (Lonza) for 2 weeks. Adipocytes were also
generated from the adipocyte precursor (pre-adipocyte)
cell line PCS-210-010 (ATCC), or pre-WAT cells isolated
from subcutaneous fat (LONZA), or isolated from the BM
aspirates of healthy adults or MM patients, and further
purified by 10 min centrifugation at 186 g [47]. Mature
adipocytes were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde,
stained with Oil red O for 1 hour, and observed under light
microscopy [48].

Monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) staining
Cells were stained with 100 µM MDC at 37°C for
15 minutes, and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus BX60) [39]. The percentage of MDC+ cells was
determined by a score of 500 cells per sample.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) and reverse transcribed. The cDNAs were
amplified with the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system
(Life Technologies), SYBR Green, and the following
primers:
adipsin:
GACACCATCGACCACGACC,
GCCACGTCGCAGAGAGTTC;
leptin:

Osteoprotegerin
(OPG):
CGCTCGTGTTTCTGGACAT,
CGGTCTTCCACTTTGCTGTA;
Monocyte
chemoattractant
protein

Co-cultures of MM cells and mature adipocytes
MM cells (1×105/ml) were seeded in culture wells
that had been coated with mature adipocytes (2×104/ml);
alternatively, adipocytes were seeded in the culture wells
and MM cells were seeded in the transwell inserts in RPMI
1640 medium. Adipocyte-conditioned media was added to
the cultures of MM cells. In some experiments, 25 μM
melphalan, 10 μM dexamethasone, 5 nM bortezomib, or
1 µM doxorubicin was added for 24 hours. DMSO served
as the control.

Six to eight week-old female CB.17 SCID mice
obtained from Charles River Laboratories were housed and
maintained in American Association of Laboratory Animal
Care-accredited facilities. The studies were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MD
Anderson. 5 × 105 MM cells alone or in combination with
5 × 105 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled mature
adipocytes were directly injected into the mouse femur
[49]. Melphalan treatment (50 μg/mouse) was given
after 2 weeks. For MM xenograft mouse models, mice
were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106 ARP-1 cells.
4 weeks later when palpable tumors (5 mm in diameter)
developed, melphalan treatment was given every 3 days
for 3 weeks. Control mice received equal amounts of
PBS. Tumors were measured twice a week with calipers
and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated as (width2 ×
length)/2. Mice were euthanized when moribund or when
subcutaneous tumors reached 15 mm in diameter.
BM cells from mouse femurs were flushed out,
and the human CD138+ or CD138- subset was isolated
using anti-human CD138-coated magnetic beads. Cells
were then labeled with the antibodies, and analyzed with
a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. Mouse sera were
collected for ELISA analysis. To measure size of lytic
bone lesions, radiographs were scanned with a Faxitron
X-ray cabinet (IL). For histologic analyses, mice femurs
were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 18 hours.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of bones
were deparaffinized [15]. Slides were stained with antiperilipin or anti-CD138 antibodies, and counterstained
with hematoxylin.
