Abstract
Protein kinases are central targets for drug-based cancer
treatment. To avoid functional impairment, the cell develops
mechanisms of drug resistance, primarily based on adaptive
mutations. Redesigning a drug to target a drug-resistant
mutant kinase constitutes a therapeutic challenge. We
approach the problem by redesigning the anticancer drug
imatinib guided by local changes in interfacial de-wetting
propensities of the C-Kit kinase target introduced by an
imatinib-resistant mutation. The ligand is redesigned by
sculpting the shifting hydration patterns of the target. The
association with the modified ligand overcomes the mutationdriven destabilization of the induced fit. Consequently, the
redesigned drug inhibits both mutant and wild-type kinase.
The modeling effort is validated through molecular dynamics,
test tube kinetic assays of downstream phosphorylation
activity, high-throughput bacteriophage-display kinase
screening, cellular proliferation assays, and cellular immunoblots. The inhibitor redesign reported delineates a molecular
engineering paradigm to impair routes for drug resistance.

Introduction
Protein kinases have been identified as central targets in
molecular cancer therapy (1–3). However, kinases are actually
moving targets because the cell develops mechanisms of drug
resistance, mainly mutations, that hamper ligand association (1).
The development of drug-resistant mutations on targeted proteins
poses a challenge to inhibitor design (1–3). The C-KIT kinase, a
therapeutic target for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GIST), is inhibited by imatinib (Gleevec, STI571; refs. 4, 5), but in
malignancies like systemic mastocytosis or acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), the kinase develops the activation loop mutation D816V
(6, 7), promoting resistance to imatinib inhibition (2, 3). Here, we
report on a rational redesign of imatinib that inhibits the imatinibresistant mutant and wild-type kinase. The prototype is designed to
be a better stabilizer of the active induced-fit conformation of the
activation loop. The ligand redesign is guided by the mutationinduced alterations to the interfacial hydration pattern of the target.
The rationale for enhancing the affinity towards the active
conformation hinges on the fact that the mutation conferring drug

resistance cannot be too structurally deleterious as to impair kinase
function; otherwise, it would not prevail in the cell life cycle. Thus,
drug resistance is dealt with by a perturbative ligand modification.
To promote a tighter grip on the activation loop of C-Kit kinase
and overcome the destabilizing effect of the mutation, we
identified changes in the local dehydration propensities at the
ligand/protein interface that may be compensated by redesigning
the parental drug. The prototype ligand is engineered according to
the blueprint of residence times of water molecules that solvate the
target interface (8). Molecular modeling led us to introduce a
specific methylation of imatinib. We confirmed through in vitro
assays the dual inhibitory effect of the prototype by probing the
downstream phosphorylation activity of wild-type and imatinibresistant kinase in the presence of the parental and prototype
competitive ligands. The focused effect of the prototype over a vast
cross-section of the human kinome was corroborated by highthroughput screening (9). We also conducted cell proliferation
assays on lines that express wild-type and imatinib-resistant kinase
to confirm the dual anticancer activity of the prototype.

Materials and Methods
Calculation of local dehydration propensities. We introduce a
descriptor of hydration tightness for soluble proteins defined as the mean
residence time of hydrating molecules within a domain around each residue
on the protein surface. The local mean residence time (<s>i ) of hydrating
molecules at residue i is defined with respect to a spherical domain D(i) of
6.2-Å radius (approximately the width of three water layers; ref. 10) centered
at the a-carbon of residue i. The actual computation of residence times is
given in the Supplementary Material. The mean residence times were
obtained from classic trajectories generated by molecular dynamic
simulations (Supplementary Material).
Backbone exposure for protein targets. The extent of backbone
exposure at a particular residue was determined by counting the number of
nonpolar side chain groups contained within a 6.2-Å radius sphere
(approximately the thickness of three water layers) centered at the acarbon. The extent of backbone shielding (g) in structured regions averaged
over a nonredundant curated PDB database (1,662 proteins) is 14.2, with
Gaussian dispersion of 8.2. Thus, a backbone site is regarded as exposed if
the region is structurally disordered or if g < 6. The statistics vary for
desolvation radius in the range of 6 Å < r < 7 Å, but the tails of the
distribution identify the same sites of backbone exposure. The structural
integrity of soluble proteins requires that most backbone amides and
carbonyls be protected from hydration. Thus, residues with absent
backbone coordinates in a PDB entry are regarded as exposed and thus
are residues from natively disordered proteins.
Molecular dynamics/free-energy computations. Classic molecular
dynamic simulations were done starting from the crystal structure of the CKIT kinase (PDB.1T46, 1.60-Å resolution; ref. 5). Simulations were done for
the wild-type kinase complexed with imatinib and for the in silico generated
D816V mutant complexed with imatinib and WBZ_7. The Amber package
was used to obtain 50 ns of molecular dynamics with explicit solvent in the

was introduced in silico , and the structures examined were obtained after 50 ns molecular dynamic equilibration of the uncomplexed kinases (Materials and Methods,
Supplementary Material). Residue numbering follows PDB entry 1T46. The one-letter amino acid code was adopted for clarity. Columns, mean; bars, variances. Local
dehydration propensities are signaled by relatively short residence times and represent weaknesses in the hydration shell of the target protein. Only residues in contact
with the ligand in PDB complex 1T46 are indicated for clarity. A contact is defined by the presence of ligand atoms within a 6.2-Å sphere centered at the a-carbon.
The changes in dehydration propensity introduced by the D816V mutation are most pronounced for residues F811 and A814. B, location of imatinib inhibitor with

the ATP pocket: the P-loop (magenta , residues 594–604) and catalytic loop (light blue , residues 670–677). In addition, the side chains of the catalytic triad DFG

energy were estimated by calculating the quasiharmonic entropy (12),
which takes into the account both the configurational and vibrational
entropy contributions arising from structural changes and creation of new
modes upon complexation.
Synthesis of imatinib derivative WBZ_7. The synthesis of the imatinib
derivative resulting from methylation at position 6 on the pyperidine ring
recapitulates Novartis patent WO03027100A1, 2003 (13), replacing a single
reactant (N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal) for N,N-dimethylformamide methyl-dimethylacetal in the first step of synthesis. The total synthesis
and spectroscopic characterization is provided in the Supplementary
Material.
Spectrophotometric kinetic assay. To determine the inhibitory efficacy
of WBZ_7, kinetic assays of the inhibition of active (phosphorylated) wildtype C-Kit kinase and active variant D816V (Upstate, Millipore) were
conducted. To measure the rate of downstream phosphorylation due to
kinase activity in the presence of inhibitors, a spectrophotometric assay has
been adopted in which the ADP production is coupled to the NADH
oxidation and determined by absorbance reduction at 340 nm, as described
in ref. (14). Details are provided in the Supplementary Material.
High-throughput screening. A primary high-throughput screening of
WBZ_7 at 10 Amol/L was conducted by Ambit Biosciences (San Diego, CA)
against a bacteriophage library displaying 240 human kinases, using
imatinib screening as control. A rough estimation of the binding constant
(K 1
d ) for each assay was provided by the single-hit value in the primary
screen at a single compound concentration. Kinase profiling was done using
a bacteriophage library displaying fused human kinases that may attach at
the ATP site to a fixed-ligand matrix, which, in turn, may be competitively
displaced from binding by the tested compound (9).
Cell proliferation assays. Proliferation of GIST cancer cells (line
ST882) expressing C-Kit kinase (15) was determined by Alamar Blue assay
(Bio Source International) following a 48-h treatment with imatinib and
WBZ_7. The treated murine pro-B cells Ba/F3 (American Type Culture
Collection) expressing C-Kit D816V (16) were investigated using a
tetrazolium-based assay (17), adopting the same generic set-up described
above. Human HMC-1 mast cells (ref. 18; gift from J.H. Butterfield, Mayo
Clinic) expressing the C-Kit D816V mutant were monitored through a 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay after 48 h of treatment. Details are
provided in the Supplementary Material.

Western blots. HMC-1 and Ba/F3 cells were incubated untreated and
treated with WBZ_7 or imatinib (0.1, 1, and 10 Amol/L) for 12 h. After
treatment, cell pellets were lysed, and protein mixtures were separated
though gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Membranes were subsequently
probed with specific antibodies. Details are given in the Supplementary
Material.

Results
The structural basis for imatinib inhibition of C-Kit is revealed by
examining the kinase-ligand interface (PDB.1T46; ref. 5). The ligand
promotes an induced fit in the activation loop, thus binding to the
active conformation. Nevertheless, there exists a sticky element in
the active conformation, which is not interactive with imatinib.
Residues F811 and A814 mark sites of weakness in the hydration
shell of the target (Fig. 1A). These residues are paired by the solventaccessible F811-A814 backbone hydrogen bond, which is prone to
becoming dehydrated (10), as evidenced by the short residence times
of local hydrating molecules in the crankshaft-like active conformation (Fig. 1A–C). The removal of surrounding water upon
association enhances the backbone amide-carbonyl electrostatic
interaction (10). Solvent accessibility is defined by a low number of
surrounding nonpolar groups within residue microenvironments
(Materials and Methods). Imatinib association contributes only
partially to water removal from the pair F811-A814 whose de-wetting
propensity is most affected by the D816V mutation (Fig. 1A).
Hydrating molecules with low residence times constitute our
blueprint for ligand re-engineering because they signal a propensity
for association. Because the 811-814 hydrogen bond is altogether
absent in the inactive (autoinhibited) conformation of the loop
(PDB.1T45), we were able to selectively enhance the affinity for the
active conformation, by redesigning imatinib to increase its
favorable exogenous dehydration. This higher level of favorable
interactivity required a modulation of the target microenvironment
through the incorporation of a methyl group at position 6 in the
pyrimidine ring (13), yielding the compound WBZ_7 (Fig. 2;
Materials and Methods).

Figure 3. A, downstream phosphorylation rates from spectrophotometric kinetic assay of active C-Kit kinase and active imatinib-resistant D816V mutant (Upstate,
Millipore). Both kinases are inhibited by WBZ_7 (squares ), whereas only the wild-type C-Kit is significantly inhibited by imatinib (triangles ). Phosphorylation rate
plots are displayed for wild-type kinase (blue ) and for the D816V variant (red). Bars, dispersion over five runs for each kinetic assay (Materials and Methods). Each
assay run consists of 11 measurements of maximum phosphorylation rate at 100-nmol/L intervals in increasing inhibitor concentration for each of the four kinase/
inhibitor pairs. Notice that in contrast with imatinib, WBZ_7 is an inhibitor of the imatinib-resistant mutated as well as of the wild-type kinase. Fluctuations in initial
enzyme concentrations are likely sources of experimental error particularly apparent at low inhibitor concentrations (K m(app) V [ATP]). B to D, high-throughput screening
of WBZ_7 (red) and imatinib (blue , control) over 240 human kinases displayed in a T7-bacteriophage library (Ambit Biosciences, Materials and Methods). Hit values
are reported as % bound kinase.

The ligand redesign was first validated through molecular
dynamic simulations of the wild-type kinase-imatinib association
and D816V mutant association with imatinib and WBZ_7
(Materials and Methods; refs. 11, 12). The calculated binding free
energies are 17.0, 4.5, and 16.1 kcal mol1, for wild-type
kinase-imatinib association and D816V mutant complexation with
imatinib and WBZ_7, respectively. These values show the same
tendency in terms of inhibitor affinity found in the in vitro kinetic
analysis reported below. The energetic contributions are 57.69,
59.15, and 59.24 kcal mol1, and the entropic contributions
(TDS) are 40.7, 54.7, and 43.2 kcal mol1, respectively. These
results indicate that the decrease in imatinib affinity caused by
target mutation and the compensatory affinity increase introduced
by WBZ_7 are mainly entropic effects. Imatinib resistance arises
from the entropy increase (TDS f 14 kcal mol1) of the
uncomplexed mutant with respect to the uncomplexed wild type.
This difference translates into the free energy difference between
the respective imatinib associations. The entropy increase is due to
the hydrophilic ! hydrophobic destabilizing amino acid substitution in the (solvent exposed) activation loop. WBZ_7 restores the

www.aacrjournals.org

affinity for the mutant kinase by increasing the entropy of the
complex (TDS f 12 kcal mol1) with respect to the imatinib
mutant counterpart, accounting for the difference in binding
affinity. The added methyl in WBZ_7 becomes a surrogate for V816
in promoting water removal from the F811-A814 de-wetting
hotspot (Fig. 1A), thus enhancing loop flexibility and hence
restoring ligand affinity.
The inhibiting efficacy of the prototype was tested in
spectrophotometric kinetic assays (Materials and Methods;
Fig. 3A; ref. 14), measuring the downstream phosphorylation rates
of active wild type and D816V mutant at various inhibitor
concentrations. Thus, by taking full advantage of the potential
for interactivity with the activation loop in the activated
conformation, we were able to redesign imatinib into WBZ_7,
a nanomolar inhibitor (K d  39 F 7 nmol/L) of the imatinibresistant D816V mutant as well as of the wild-type kinase (K d  21
F 5 nmol/L). The effect of the prototype compound should be
contrasted with that of imatinib on the same targets: K d  11 F
2 Amol/L for the imatinib-resistant D816V mutant and K d  25 F
5 nmol/L for the wild-type C-Kit kinase. The latter powerful

inhibition is entirely expected, given the therapeutic value of
imatinib for treating GIST tumors by targeting wild-type C-Kit
(4, 5). On the other hand, the affinity of WBZ_7 for the imatinibresistant kinase is about 300 times higher. A tighter grip on the
activation loop stabilizes its active conformation to such an extent
that it counteracts the negative-design feature (Fig. 1A) introduced
by the drug-resistant mutation.
A Michaelis-Menten scheme with ATP-competitive inhibition
and throughout-saturating peptide-substrate concentration yields
an accurate fit in all cases shown in Fig. 3A. Fluctuations in initial
enzyme concentration yield rate-value dispersions (Materials and
Methods; Fig. 3A) that are pronounced at low inhibitor concentration (because K m(app) V [ATP]) and translate into the SD
reported for the K d values. The plots generated with K d/dispersions
lie within the confidence bands for the rate/[I] plots (Fig. 3A).
To complete the in vitro analysis, WBZ_7 at 10 Amol/L was
screened for affinity against a T7-bacteriophage library displaying
240 human kinases (Fig. 3B–D) as described previously (ref. 9;

Materials and Methods), using imatinib screening as control. The
dual affinity of WBZ_7 on C-Kit kinase and on the D816V mutant is
noteworthy and contrasts with the lack of affinity of imatinib for
the mutant. WBZ_7 is also more specific than the parental
compound, as it has a low affinity for the Abelson (ABL) kinase, the
primary imatinib target, and its variants (14). This selectivity is
expected because WBZ_7 was designed to enhance the ligand
interactivity towards the active conformation of the activation
loop, whereas imatinib binds the constitutively active Bcr-ABL
kinase in the inactive conformation (14). Also noteworthy is the
WBZ_7 inhibition of discoidin receptor 1 kinase (DDR1; Fig. 3B).
This finding suggests additional anticancer activity for WBZ_7
because DDR1 is up-regulated by p53, and DDR1 inhibition
dramatically increases p53-mediated apoptosis through a positive
feedback loop (19).
The anticancer activity of WBZ_7 was tested in vivo by
selecting cell lines that express the wild-type and drug-resistant
kinase (Materials and Methods; refs. 15–17, 20). The proliferation

and Ba/F3 murine pro-B (green ). WBZ_7 inhibits
proliferation of C-Kit–positive GIST cells and of C-Kit
(D816V)–positive Ba/F3 murine pro-B and HMC-1 cells.
The inhibitory effect of imatinib is essentially restricted to
the GIST cells that express only the wild-type kinase.
Cell proliferation, expressed as % proliferating cells
relative to untreated cells, was determined by the
spectrophotometric assay (Materials and Methods).
Assays on batteries of 24 wells for each inhibitor
concentration/cell type pair were repeated four times,
and the value dispersions for each battery were averaged
over the four batteries (columns ). SD were obtained as
root mean square deviations of measured populations
from the arithmetic mean. The latter was obtained for
each ligand concentration/cell type pair by averaging the
four mean values obtained from the four repetitions of the
batteries of 24 assays. B, Western blot assay of murine

of C-Kit–positive GIST cells (15) treated with WBZ_7 was
significantly decreased (IC50  72 F 4 nmol/L) in a quantitative
dose-dependent manner similar to imatinib (IC50  65 F 5 nmol/L;
Fig. 4A). By contrast, the inhibitory effect of imatinib on murine
Ba/F3 cells expressing the C-Kit (D816V) mutation (16) is very
low at the same bulk physiologic doses (IC50  19.0 F 0.5 Amol/L),
whereas WBZ_7 significantly impairs the proliferation of these
cells (IC50  95 F 5 nmol/L). The mast-cell line HMC-1 (18)
expressing the D816V mutant was also treated with WBZ_7 and
imatinib. Accordingly, a significant effect (38% decrease) on
proliferation was observed for WBZ_7 at the 10 Amol/L bulk
concentration, in sharp contrast with imatinib, which only
impaired cell growth by 7%.
In searching for other appropriate human cell lines, we noted
that mutations in C-Kit have been detected in some patients with
AML; however, no human AML cell lines have been developed
bearing the D816V mutation (21).
A Western blot (Materials and Methods) on treated Ba/F3 and
HMC-1 cells expressing the drug-resistant mutation (Fig. 4B and
C) was done to determine the inhibitory activity of WBZ_7 on
kinase autophosphorylation. Densitometry revealed 91% inhibition of the D816V mutant by WBZ_7 at the 10 Amol/L bulk
concentration in Ba/F3 cells. By contrast, imatinib inhibition of
the mutant is 9% under the same conditions. For HMC-1 cells,
WBZ_7 inhibition is 32%, in contrast with imatinib that inhibited
the mutant by 12%. HMC-1 cells do not overexpress the kinase in
response to the WBZ_7 inhibition of the active form, whereas Ba/
F3 cells do, as evidenced by the stronger total mutant kinase
(intermediate) band at 10 Amol/L inhibitor when compared with
the band at lower inhibitor concentrations (Fig. 4B). The

difference in the extent of inhibition of C-Kit (D816V) by
WBZ_7 in the two cell lines is likely of pharmacokinetic origin
and attributable to a reduced absorption of the drug into the
human cells when compared with the murine cells, which in turn
accounts for the higher expression levels of the mutant kinase
found in the WBZ_7-treated murine cells.

Discussion
Drug resistance promoted by mutational modification constitutes a challenge for drug designers thus faced with a shifting
target. More daunting is the problem of re-engineering an inhibitor
to overcome the negative design introduced by mutations that
confer resistance to the original inhibitor. We approached this
problem in kinase targeting by redesigning the ligand according to
changes in the target hydration pattern induced by the mutation.
We rationally created a therapeutic agent that overcomes drug
resistance. A combination of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo assays
validates our design strategy, likely to inspire a new generation of
molecular therapies for shifting targets arising from drug-resistant
patterns.
