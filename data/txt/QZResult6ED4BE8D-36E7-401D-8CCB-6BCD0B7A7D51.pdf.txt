Abstract
High-grade gliomas often possess an impaired blood–brain barrier (BBB), which allows delivery of large
molecules to brain tumors. However, achieving optimal drug concentrations in brain tumors remains a
signiﬁcant hurdle for treating patients successfully. Thus, detailed investigations of drug activities in gliomas
are needed. To investigate BBB penetration, pharmacodynamics, and tumor retention kinetics of an agonistic
DR5 antibody in a brain tumor xenograft model, we utilized a noninvasive imaging method for longitudinal
monitoring of apoptosis induction. Brain tumors were induced by intracranial (i.c.) implantation of a
luciferase-expressing tumor cell line as a reporter. To quantify accumulation of anti-DR5 in brain tumors, we
generated a dosage–response curve for apoptosis induction after i.c. delivery of ﬂuorescence-labeled anti-DR5
at different dosages. Assuming 100% drug delivery after i.c. application, the amount of accumulated antibody
after i.v. application was calculated relative to its apoptosis induction. We found that up to 0.20% to 0.97% of
antibody delivered i.v. reached the brain tumor, but that apoptosis induction declined quickly within 24
hours. These results were conﬁrmed by three-dimensional ﬂuorescence microscopy of antibody accumulation in explanted brains. Nonetheless, signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy was documented after anti-DR5
delivery. We further demonstrated that antibody penetration was facilitated by an impaired BBB in brain
tumors. These imaging methods enable the quantiﬁcation of antibody accumulation and pharmacodynamics
in brain tumors, offering a holistic approach for assessment of central nervous system–targeting drugs.

Introduction
A signiﬁcant obstacle in the treatment of brain disorders
is caused by the restricted diffusion of potential therapeutics
through the intact blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is
built up by tight junctions that connect brain capillary
endothelial cells and foot processes of astrocytes, which
wrap around the brain vessels to further diminish fenestration and permeability (1). Many approaches such as osmotic
BBB disruption, intracerebral microinfusion, or brain shuttle
systems have been reported to increase delivery of therapeutics into the brain (1–5).
Only some anticancer compounds such as temozolomide
are known to pass the intact BBB in reasonable amounts (6–8)

but, so far, the standard-of-care treatment temozolomide plus
radiotherapy only leads to modest clinical efﬁcacy and median
survival times of 14.2 months after diagnosis with glioblastoma
multiforme (9). Therapeutic antibodies have shown promising
antitumor efﬁcacies on malignant brain tumor cells (10–12),
but they could not pass an intact BBB to deploy clinical efﬁcacy
(13–15). High-grade gliomas, however, are known to diversely
compromise the BBB most likely in the hypoxic core region of
the tumor and neovasculature in brain tumors might not
display the same integrity as the BBB in healthy brain tissue
(16–18). Dependent on the grade of BBB impairment by brain
tumors, it is expected that 0.1% (intact BBB) to 2.0% (disrupted
BBB) of systemically applied antibody could reach the brain
tumor (1, 19).
In the clinical situation, these calculations are based on the
comparison of antibody concentrations in the cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) and in the circulation after systemic application of
the antibody. Alternatively, antibody kinetics in brain tumors
can be determined by positron emission tomography (PET)
using a three-compartment model (20). Holdhoff and colleagues determined concentrations of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in intraoperatively obtained brain tumor samples
by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (21).
To determine BBB crossing of antibodies in preclinical orthotopic xenografts, radio- or ﬂuorescence-labeled antibodies are

applied, but quantiﬁcation of signal intensities of successfully
delivered antibody can only be examined in dissected brains
fractionated into brain capillaries and brain parenchyma (22–
24). Intravital ﬂuorescence videomicroscopy of exposed brain
tumors through a cranial window can be used to investigate
vessel maturation, blood ﬂow, and distribution of ﬂuorescence-labeled molecules in real time (25, 26).
A detailed investigation of pharmacodynamics and kinetics
of anticancer compounds in brain tumors besides efﬁcacy and
survival studies, however, has not been reported yet. Therefore,
we applied noninvasive apoptosis imaging as a pharmacodynamic readout after treatment with an anti-DR5 antibody. This
bioluminescence-based apoptosis imaging relies on the complementation of split luciferase components C-Luc and N-Luc
to a functional luciferase enzyme after caspase-3/7–dependent
cleavage of the stably transfected apoptosis reporter construct
C-Luc-DEVD-N-Luc in tumor cells (Fig. 1) (27, 28). Consequently, the conversion of external added substrate luciferin
into oxyluciferin and light emission is proportional to caspase3/7 activation and apoptosis induction by anti-DR5.
We have recently shown that anti-DR5 leads to tremendous
apoptosis induction in s.c. glioblastoma multiforme tumors
some hours after application (28). However, the more clinically
relevant model is the orthotopic implantation of tumor cells to
consider the speciﬁc brain microenvironment and the inﬂuence of the diversely impaired BBB. By intracranial (i.c.)
inoculation of these apoptosis reporter glioblastoma multiforme cells, the apoptosis reporter is only activated when antiDR5 crosses the BBB, reaches the tumor cells, and induces
apoptosis via caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 (Fig. 1). The quantiﬁcation of apoptosis induction could therefore indicate the
amount of anti-DR5, which has reached the brain tumor.
Moreover, the pharmacodynamics of anti-DR5 in brain tumors
can be investigated over time, indicating the amount of antibody that has been retained in the tumor.

Compounds targeting the apoptosis pathways and inducing
apoptosis via death receptors 4 and 5 have previously shown
promising antitumor efﬁcacies in preclinical brain tumor
models in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy
(29–31). However, these investigations only relied on survival
studies. Here, we quantiﬁed pharmacodynamics and the
amount of anti-DR5, which crosses the impaired BBB by
apoptosis imaging and determined if these amounts are sufﬁcient to deploy antitumor efﬁcacy. Moreover, we highlighted
the impact of BBB impairment by brain tumors on facilitated
antibody penetration into brain tissue.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and anti-DR5 generation
Anti-DR5 antibody, a fully human agonistic antibody to
death receptor 5, was cloned based on the antibody sequences
described in the patent application US 2007/0031414 A1 (32).
The variable genes of anti-DR5 were fused in frame with human
immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) constant l and constant heavy
chain in standard mammalian expression vectors. Lectin from
Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-I) was purchased from SigmaAldrich. Control antibody human IgG (Normal) was purchased
from Invitrogen. The antibodies and lectin were labeled inhouse with Cy5, Alexa Fluor 647 (A647), or Alexa Fluor 750
(A750) by monoreactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for speciﬁc labeling of amine residues according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Cell lines and culture
D54–caspase-3/7 GloSensor cells (obtained from the Center
for Molecular Imaging on February 10, 2011) were last tested
negative on pathogens by molecular diagnostics infectious
disease PCR (Charles River) on October 24, 2012, and were
authenticated 1 week before implantation by morphologic and
growth curve analysis. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640

medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 10% FCS (all
PAN Biotech GmbH), and 200 mg/mL G-418 (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH).
Intracranial implantation
Female severe combined immunodeﬁcient hairless outbred (SHO) mice (weight 20 to 27 g) were obtained from
Charles River and were 7 to 9 weeks of age at initiation of
experiments. Mice were anesthetized with i.p. injection of
100 mg/kg ketamine (WDT) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun; Bayer Vital GmbH). Scalp was disinfected and removed
over the whole right hemisphere of the brain to expose the
cranium. The periosteum was removed by a bone scraper.
Next, a 0.7-mm burr hole in diameter was drilled 2 mm right
of midline and 0.5 mm posterior to bregma with a dental
drill. Mice were then placed in a small animal stereotactic
frame (David Kopf Instruments) to allow proper cell inoculation. A 25-mL 22-gauge needle (Hamilton) ﬁlled with D54–
caspase-3/7 GloSenor cell suspension (8  107 cells per mL)
was adjusted in a 60 ankle over the burr hole and penetrated 3 mm into the brain tissue. Three microliters of the
cell suspension (240,000 cells) was slowly injected into the
brain. After injection, needle was slowly withdrawn and hole
was sealed with Cyano veneer tissue glue (Hager Werken).
All animal studies were approved by the local government
(ﬁle number 55.2-1-54-2532.2-42-11, Government of Upper
Bavaria, Germany).
Bioluminescence imaging, randomization, and signal
analysis
Mice were injected with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin i.p. (Biosynth
AG). Twelve minutes after luciferin application, mice were
anesthetized with 2% isoﬂuran and placed in an IVIS Spectrum
(PerkinElmer) in prone position and measured. Bioluminescent signals were read out as average radiance (p/s/cm3/sr) in a
circular region of interest (ROI) over the cranium with the
Living Image software (PerkinElmer). Every ROI signal was
divided by the related ROI signal measured for randomization
to get fold induction. Seven days after cell implantation, mice
were randomized in treatment groups of 3 to 5 mice each
according to their basal bioluminescent signals.
Intravenous and i.c. application of antibody
One day after randomization, anti–DR5-Cy5 was systemically given via the tail vein. To determine a dosage–response
curve, Cy5-labeled anti-DR5 antibody was injected intracranially at different dosages into the brain. Therefore, mice were
anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamin and 10 mg/kg xylazin
i.p., sealing tissue glue was lifted, and mouse was ﬁxed in the
stereotactic frame. To ensure antibody injection in close
proximity to the brain tumor, the same stereotactic coordinates were used as for cell implantation. After slow withdrawal
of the syringe, the hole was sealed with tissue glue again.
Antibodies were given once for delivery study and thrice for
efﬁcacy study. For delivery study, bioluminescent signal of
mice was measured twice (4 and 8 hours after treatment) and
the higher signal was considered for calculations of delivered
amount.

Necropsy
Mice were sacriﬁced 8 hours after (last) drug application. Ten
minutes before sacriﬁce, mice were injected i.v. with 100 mL of a
1-mg/mL lectin-A750 solution to allow visualization of blood
vessels ex vivo. Mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation.
Brain was explanted and transferred to 10% formalin solution.
3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs and determination
of tumor growth inhibition and antibody accumulation
3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (3DISCO) was performed as previously described (33). Brieﬂy, brain tissues or s.c.
tumors were dehydrated in tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich)
dilution series (50%, 70%, 80%, 3 100% for 12 hours each) and
cleared in dibenzyl ether (DBE; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 days. The
cleared samples were placed in a light sheet ultramicroscope
(LaVision Biotec) equipped with a MVX10 Fluorescence
MacroZoom, a 2 Mv PLAPO 2VC objective lens (both Olympus) and an Imager 3QE camera (LaVision Biotec). The samples were scanned with a standard magniﬁcation of 0.63 in
5.1-mm thick virtual sections with Cy5 (antibody signal) and
A750 (lectin vessel staining) ﬁlter settings. Tiff raw data were
converted to dicom ﬁles, which were processed and 3D reconstructed by the OsiriX software (Pixmeo). A three-dimensional
(3D) brain tumor ROI was deﬁned according to the dimensions
of chaotic vessel structures seen by lectin-A750 staining. The
determined 3D ROI was imported to 3D-reconstructed antibody-Cy5 data ﬁles to read out brain tumor volumes and mean
antibody ﬂuorescent signals within the tumors (ﬂuorescent
signal intensities of circulating antibody in blood vessels were
subtracted). Representative 3DISCO images in 2D were
depicted with maximal intensity projection (MIP) of 10 consecutive virtual sections.
Subcutaneous xenograft model
Female SHO mice (weight 20–27 g) were obtained from
Charles River and were 7 to 9 weeks of age at initiation of
experiments. Four million D54–caspase-3/7 GloSensor cells in
100 mL PBS were inoculated in the right ﬂank of each mouse
under 2% isoﬂuran anesthesia. After 7 days, the animals were
randomized in therapy groups (5 mice per group) according to
their basal bioluminescent signal and their tumor volume. All
animal studies were approved by the local government (ﬁle
number 55.2-1-54-2532.2-26-09, Government of Upper Bavaria,
Germany).
Determination of antibody penetration from vessels to
tissue
For antibody penetration studies, 4 mice each with detectable brain tumors, without brain tumors, and with s.c. tumors
were treated with 5 mg/kg human IgG-A750 for 8 hours and 100
mg lectin-A647 was applied 10 minutes before sacriﬁce. Necropsy and 3DISCO were conducted as described above. The
distinct ﬂuorescent signal intensities of IgG-A750 at different
distances from nearest lectin-A647–stained blood vessels for
healthy brain, brain tumor, and s.c. tumor tissue were determined as recently described by Dobosz and colleagues with an
in-house–developed quantiﬁcation software (34), and the
areas under these curves (AUC) were calculated.

Immunohistological staining
Cleared samples were removed from DBE solution, washed
once with xylole, incubated in parafﬁn at 60 C for 1 hour (4
times), and blocked in parafﬁn. Cut parafﬁn sections (2.5 mm)
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and for cleaved
caspase-3 in consecutive sections. Cleaved caspase-3 (D175)
rabbit antibody (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology) was incubated for 60 minutes after deparafﬁnization, steam heated at
96 C for 15 minutes, and protein blocking was performed. Alexa
Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Invitrogen) as secondary
antibody was incubated for 30 minutes. Sections were coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel II with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were analyzed by
multispectral ﬂuorescence microscopy using Pannoramic 250
1.14 slide scanner and Pannoramic Viewer 1.15 (3D Histech).
Statistical analysis
All data values are represented as mean  SEM. Statistical
analysis was performed using the JMP8 software (SAS). A twosided pairwise t test was applied for analysis. P values of <0.05
were considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Imaging of apoptosis in brain tumors
We have recently shown that anti-DR5 treatment led to
signiﬁcant apoptosis induction in s.c. D54–caspase-3/7 GloSenor tumors (28). However, the more critical point to address
is the potential of anti-DR5 antibody to induce apoptosis in
orthotopic brain tumors. Bioluminescence imaging of untreated mice directly and 7 days after i.c. inoculation revealed weak
but detectable basal bioluminescent signals, which increased
over time (Supplementary Fig. S1A). All animals showed quantiﬁable signals 7 days after inoculation, indicating that spontaneous apoptotic events are sensitively detectable through the
cranium and that the inoculated tumor cells grow in the brain
parenchyma. The signal detection before treatment allowed
the randomization of animals based on their basal apoptosis
reporter signal and the expression of fold apoptosis induction
after treatment.
Tumor cell spreading into spinal cord was observed by
bioluminescence imaging in 19% of mice (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Histologic analysis of explanted brains of affected mice
revealed that tumor cells grew invasively into the lateral
ventricle and distributed via the CSF into the spinal cord
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Mice with high signals in the spinal
cord were excluded from study.
Determination of i.c. dosage–response curve
To ensure optimal drug delivery by circumventing the BBB,
anti–DR5-Cy5 was applied i.c. through the cranial burr hole
into the same depth the cells were inoculated. Four different
dosages were given i.c. to investigate dosage-dependent
responses on apoptosis induction. Even the lowest dosage
(0.005 mg/kg) led to a 4.5-fold apoptosis induction within 4
to 8 hours after application. The apoptosis induction steadily
increased but less prominent between 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg,
indicating saturation with anti–DR5-Cy5 (Fig. 2A and B). The
ﬁtted dosage–response curve for i.c. application in Fig. 2A

1916

Cancer Res; 74(7) April 1, 2014

allowed the quantiﬁcation of the amount of antibody delivered
to the tumor. Assuming a 100% drug delivery by i.c. application,
the rate of apoptosis induction after systemic application of
anti–DR5-Cy5 directly correlates with the amount of antibody
that has reached the brain tumor. An almost 100% drug
delivery for 0.005 and 0.02 mg/kg i.c. dosages was conﬁrmed
by 3DISCO and 2D immunoﬂuorescence, which visualized
strong anti–DR5-Cy5 accumulation in the brain tumor but
low unspeciﬁc spreading in healthy brain tissue (Fig. 2C, left
and middle). At i.c. application of 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg, however,
DR5 receptors in the tumor tissue seem to be saturated and
increasing amounts of anti–DR5-Cy5 were detected outside
the tumor site. The dimensions of brain tumors could easily be
determined due to bright lectin-A750 staining of chaotic tumor
vessels but less prominent staining of healthy brain vessels
(most likely due to resolution limitations of healthy brain
capillaries smaller than 5 mm in diameter). H&E staining in
consecutive sections conﬁrmed localization of brain tumors in
highly vascularized areas with prominent lectin-A750 staining
(Fig. 2C, right).
Determination of anti–DR5-Cy5 delivery over the BBB
after i.v. application
The more clinical relevant application is the i.v. application.
Therefore, we quantiﬁed the amount of antibody, which was
delivered to the brain tumor after i.v. injection by comparing
the rate of apoptosis induction after i.c. and i.v. application.
Monitoring anti–DR5-Cy5 accumulation in the brain tumor by
in vivo ﬂuorescence imaging could not been applied due to
tremendous background noises in the whole body caused by
circulating and unspeciﬁc accumulated anti–DR5-Cy5 even 24
hours after i.v. application (Supplementary Fig. S2). Bioluminescence apoptosis imaging, however, allowed to sensitively
detect the dosage-dependent effect on apoptosis induction
when anti–DR5-Cy5 is given i.v. at different dosages. This
indicates that the antibody has at least partially crossed the
BBB and has targeted the tumor site. An i.v. dosage of 3 mg/kg
led to a 20.8-fold increase. This dosage induces apoptosis
slightly more than a 0.02 mg/kg dosage given i.c. (17.9-fold).
An approximation of the delivered dose can be made by ﬁtting
a dosage–response curve and using the resulting equation.
Consequently, a 20.8-fold apoptosis induction after i.v. application of 3 mg/kg anti–DR5-Cy5 correlates with a 0.029 mg/kg
i.c. given dosage (Fig. 3A and B). Assuming a 100% drug delivery
after i.c. application, 0.97% of i.v. given antibody has passed
the BBB and has reached the brain tumor. The 1 mg/kg i.v.
given dosage led to a 2.8-fold apoptosis induction, which equals
to a 0.002 mg/kg i.c. dosage and, therefore, to a 0.20% drug
delivery (Fig. 3A and B). For comparison, a quantitative assessment of i.v. and intratumoral anti–DR5-Cy5 application in a s.c.
D54–caspase-3/7 GloSensor model revealed that 3.90% to
7.00% of i.v. given anti–DR5-Cy5 reaches the tumor site (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Ex vivo quantiﬁcation of anti–DR5-Cy5 ﬂuorescent signals in
the brain tumor region of i.v. and i.c. treated mice using
3DISCO conﬁrmed the in vivo data (Fig. 3C and D, left).
Intracranial application showed dosage-dependent increases
in ﬂuorescent signal intensities of accumulated anti–DR5-Cy5,

Quantiﬁcation of Antibody Delivery to Brain Tumor

which allows a determination of a dosage–response curve
according to dose-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent signal intensities (Fig.
3C). Fluorescent signals after i.v. application of 1 mg/kg or 3
mg/kg anti–DR5-Cy5, respectively, revealed intensities comparable with 0.003 mg/kg or 0.028 mg/kg given intracranially,
which corresponds to 0.30% or 0.93% delivered anti–DR5-Cy5
(Fig. 3C). These calculated values are in good concordance with
values deﬁned by apoptosis reporter induction (0.20% or
0.97%), indicating a strong relationship between anti–DR5Cy5 binding to and apoptosis induction in tumor cells (Fig. 3E).
This relationship was further substantiated by immunohistochemistry. Sites of increased antibody binding to tumor cells
showed intensiﬁed active caspase-3 staining (Fig. 3D, right).
Therefore, the pharmacodynamic readout "apoptosis induction" can be used to make correct statements about the
pharmacokinetic properties of anti–DR5-Cy5.
Efﬁcacy study and monitoring apoptosis and tumor
retention kinetics over time
After quantiﬁcation of the amount of anti–DR5-Cy5 delivered to the brain tumor, we applied noninvasive imaging for
monitoring apoptosis induction in an efﬁcacy study. Apoptosis

monitoring revealed that highest apoptosis induction was
already observed 4 hours after application. Thereafter, apoptotic effects rapidly declined and were absent after 24 hours
(Fig. 4A). Redosing of anti–DR5-Cy5 6 and 13 days (144 and 312
hours) after ﬁrst treatment led to less severe apoptosis induction compared with ﬁrst treatment and this effect lasted only
for a few hours (Fig. 4A). After three i.v. applications of 3 mg/kg
unspeciﬁc IgG or 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg anti–DR5-Cy5, endpoint
volumes of brain tumors were determined by ex vivo 3DISCO.
The dimensions of chaotic vessel structure deﬁning the brain
tumor demonstrated invasive tumor growth into lateral ventricle, corpus callosum, and to the contralateral brain hemisphere in control mice and partly in low-dosage–treated mice
(Fig. 4B and C). However, invasive brain tumor growth and
tumor volume were signiﬁcantly reduced in mice treated with
3 mg/kg anti–DR5-Cy5 (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B and C).
To explain the rapid decline of apoptosis induction in brain
tumors, tumor retention kinetics of the antibody (3 mg/kg i.v.)
were investigated in a follow-up study by sacriﬁcing animals at
different time points (4, 8, 12, 24, and 72 hours) and quantifying
antibody accumulation in explanted brains. The ﬂuorescence
signal intensities in the brain tumors peaked after 4 hours

(Cmax) and dropped thereafter (Fig. 4D). Fifty percent of Cmax
was observed 19.3 hours after application and only 22.9% of
Cmax was retained after 72 hours. These kinetic data correlate
with the pharmacodynamics graph of apoptosis induction
(Cmax after 4 hours, 50% of Cmax after 12.5 hours, and 16.4% of
Cmax after 72 hours). In contrast, anti–DR5-Cy5 is longer
retained in s.c. tumors. Cmax of accumulated ﬂuorescence
signal intensity is only reached after 24 hours and 50% of
Cmax is still retained after 60.1 hours (Fig. 4E). This is in good
concordance with pharmacodynamics data in s.c. tumor (50%
of Cmax after 65.9 hours).
Visualization of BBB impairment by penetration studies
The enhanced lectin staining in the neovasculature of the
brain tumor and the slightly increased delivery of anti–DR5Cy5 over the BBB (expected 0.1% for intact BBB, measured

0.20% to 0.97%) indicate modiﬁed vessel and BBB integrities in
the brain tumor in contrast with healthy brain vessels. To
assess modiﬁed penetration of large molecules from vessels to
tumor tissue, lectin-A647 and human IgG-A750 antibody were
applied i.v. before sacriﬁce of mice. Fluorescent signals of

and s.c. tumor were quantiﬁed and plotted according to their
distinct distances to vessel (Fig. 5A). The comparison of
antibody penetration into the tissue from healthy brain vessels
or brain tumor vessels, respectively, showed signiﬁcant differences. Although IgG-A750 penetrated more than 25 mm from
brain tumor vessels into brain tumor tissue (AUC ¼ 444.3), no
quantiﬁable penetration from IgG-A750 out of healthy brain
vessels was detected more than 15 mm from vessels (AUC ¼
61.8; Fig. 5A–C). In contrast, approximately 2- to 4-fold higher
amounts of IgG-A750 could penetrate several hundred

Discussion
Here, we successfully applied noninvasive apoptosis imaging
for quantifying the amount of antibody delivery to brain
tumors and for monitoring the induction of apoptosis over
time. By comparing apoptosis induction after i.v. with i.c. antiDR5 application at different dosages, we determined the
amount of anti-DR5 that has passed the partially disrupted
BBB and has reached the brain tumor after systemic application. We found that 0.20% to 0.97% of the applied dosage had
crossed the impaired BBB and these results correlate with
previously determined values. Using a radioactivity-based
pharmacokinetic model in different knockout mouse strains,
Abuqayys and colleagues found that 0.54% to 0.92% murine
monoclonal IgG1 antibody passed the intact BBB (35). Banks
and colleagues showed that 0.11% of 131I- or 125I-labeled antiamyloid b antibody crosses an intact BBB in a mouse model of
Alzheimer disease (36). In patients with breast cancer carrying
brain metastases with intact BBB, trastuzumab, a humanized
antibody against Her2, showed approximately 420 times lower
concentrations in the CSF after systemic application in contrast with concentrations in the systemic circulation (0.24%
of trastuzumab in CSF; ref. 37). In contrast, trastuzumab
accumulated signiﬁcantly higher in CSF when BBB was compromised either by prior radiotherapy (blood-to-CSF ratio of
76:1) or in patients with concurrent meningeal carcinomatosis
(ratio 49:1; ref. 37). In these cases of BBB impairment, up to 2%
of trastuzumab could enter the CSF. The glioblastoma multiforme cell line D54-MG is known to grow invasive and to
migrate along blood vessels, which might impair the BBB (38).
Moreover, these tumor cells might disrupt the BBB through
cytokine release (39). A complete disruption of the BBB in D54MG xenografts as indicated by Blasberg and colleagues, how-

ever, could not been conﬁrmed (40). Blasberg and colleagues
found that levels of i.v. applied antibodies in D54-MG brain
tumors are in the same range as in s.c. tumors. In contrast with
these results, we determined less than 1% of anti–DR5-Cy5
reaching the brain tumor, whereas up to 7% has reached an s.
c. tumor, indicating the presence of an at least partially
functional BBB (see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Concordantly, Sarin and colleagues found by dynamic contrastenhanced MRI that gadolinium-labeled dendrimers penetrated more into ectopic intramuscular RG-2 tumors than in RG-2
orthotopic brain tumors (41). A partial impairment of 29.3% of
the BBB by tumor growth, however, was detected by antibody
penetration studies (Fig. 5), which explains the slightly
increased antibody delivery to the brain tumor. This ﬁnding
is substantiated by Qin and colleagues who determined by
99M
Tc-GH emission computed tomography that 22.1% of the
BBB is destroyed only by the brain tumor growth. Radiotherapy
further increases BBB disruption to an average of 74.7% in
patients with brain tumor (42).
Despite the fact that less than 1% of anti–DR5-Cy5
reaches the brain tumor, the delivered dosage to the tumor
is sufﬁcient to deploy signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy when
anti–DR5-Cy5 is applied i.v. in adequately high dosages (3
mg/kg or more). Because the BBB is impaired in most highgrade gliomas as well as in our investigated i.c. xenograft
models (D54, U251, and U87), the BBB crossing of antibody
might not be the limiting factor and the main reason for the
lack of efﬁcacy in the clinical situation (43). In fact, mutation in or activation of multiple aberrant signaling pathways, the migration of tumor cells along blood vessels with
completely intact and impenetrable BBB, or poor retention
times of therapeutics in the brain would limit the efﬁcacy of

Quantiﬁcation of Antibody Delivery to Brain Tumor

antitumor compounds in highly heterogeneous brain tumors
(13, 44–47).
For the ﬁrst time, we were able to monitor the pharmacodynamics of an antibody by quantifying apoptosis in brain
tumors noninvasively over time. Monitoring revealed that
initial apoptosis induction rapidly declined after 8 hours and
was absent after 24 hours, which correlates with antibody
retention times in the brain tumors (Fig. 4A and D). In contrast,
anti-DR5 showed long-lasting apoptosis induction over days in
the related s.c. xenograft model (Fig. 4E; ref. 28). Concordantly,
Burvenich and colleagues determined prolonged tumor retention of an anti-DR5 antibody and associated antitumor efﬁcacy
in s.c. colon cancer models by radioactivity-based biodistribution studies and CT imaging (48). The short apoptosis induction and antibody retention speciﬁcally in brain tumors can be
explained by a fast clearance of anti-DR5 via rapid turnover of
cerebral ﬂuids or receptor-mediated efﬂux of antibodies out of
the brain (35, 49). These results provide novel insights into the
pharmacokinetics of antibodies in brain tumors, substantiating it as reason for the failure of therapeutical antibodies to
efﬁciently treat high-grade brain tumors.
The main limitation of our approach consists in the fact that
it is only applicable for apoptosis-inducing compounds. Primarily nonapoptotic compounds such as cetuximab or erlotinib did not activate the apoptosis reporter in reasonable
amounts (data not shown). Moreover, the dosage–response
curve has to be determined for each drug assessment by i.c.
application of the drug in at least four different dosages. Higher
i.c. dosages did not show 100% drug delivery because anti–
DR5-Cy5 was also detected unspeciﬁcally distributed around
the brain tumor (Fig. 2). This might be due to a saturation effect
of DR5 with anti–DR5-Cy5 on tumor cells. Consequently,
the dosage–response curve ﬂattens above i.c. dosages of 0.02
mg/kg anti–DR5-Cy5 so that only a limited i.v. dosage range
can be evaluated. Larger brain tumors, however, might show
saturation at higher dosages so that initiation of drug application at later time points (>8 days after cell inoculation) might
solve this limitation. Therefore, a study starting with larger
brain tumors (>1 mm3) should be conducted to investigate the
antitumor effect of anti-DR5 on established brain tumors.
Ultimately, the apoptosis reporter technology cannot be transferred to clinical investigations because the tumor cells need to
be stably transfected with the reporter construct.
Nevertheless, this technology allows quantiﬁcation of BBB
crossing of proapoptotic compounds in preclinical models
without expensive PET/single-photon emission computed
tomography and the use of radioactivity or labor-intensive

cranial window technique. Moreover, monitoring apoptosis in
brain tumors over time provides a feasible, reliable, and
urgently needed pharmacodynamic readout to investigate the
activity of systemically applied compounds in brain tumors
relative to their dosage in detail (4). Thus, dosage, scheduling,
and combination therapies of proapoptotic drugs and radiotherapy can be optimized in preclinical models of brain tumors
and provide rationales to improve clinical study designs.
Particularly, the simultaneous assessment of pharmacodynamic and kinetic properties of modiﬁed antibodies, aiming
to enhance penetration across the partially functional BBB, can
be facilitated and evaluated for clinical application (50).
The technology described herein demonstrates that 0.20% to
0.97% of systemically applied anti–DR5-Cy5 has reached the
brain tumor in an i.c. glioblastoma multiforme xenograft
model with 29.3% impaired BBB. The delivered amount of
anti–DR5-Cy5 strongly induced apoptosis 4 to 8 hours after
application, but experienced rapid decline in apoptotic activity
and tumor retention thereafter, most likely due to a fast
clearance of anti–DR5-Cy5 out of the brain. Systemic treatment
of brain tumors with adequate anti–DR5-Cy5 dosages (3 mg/kg
or more) showed signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy due to strong
initial apoptosis induction.
