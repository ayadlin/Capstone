BRCA1-IRIS Overexpression Promotes Cisplatin
Resistance in Ovarian Cancer Cells
Kerri L. Chock, Jamie M.S. Allison, Yoshiko Shimizu, and Wael M. ElShamy

Abstract
Evasion of apoptosis plays a key role in cancer development, drug resistance, and recurrence. The
BRCA1 locus product protein BRCA1-IRIS is overexpressed in several cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell
lines, but its relationship to resistance is uncertain. Here, we show that in human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells, overexpression of BRCA1-IRIS triggers expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin.
Negative modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling or AKT silencing reduced survivin
expression in this setting. Conversely, silencing BRCA1-IRIS in ovarian cancer cell lines derepressed PTEN
expression along with the antiapoptotic AKT targets FOXO1 and FOXO3a, suppressing survivin expression.
Cisplatin (≤50 μmol/L) exposure was sufficient to activate expression of the BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin cascade in HOSE cells, whereas under similar conditions cisplatin failed to induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer
cell lines expressing this regulatory cascade. Mechanistic investigations indicated that BRCA1-IRIS triggers
survivin expression through a PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway involving NF-κB, but also through a PI3K/
AKT-independent pathway involving PTEN, FOXO1, and FOXO3a. Our findings indicate how BRCA1-IRIS
overexpression prevents chemotherapy-induced cell death by upregulating expression of survivin, and they
highlight this regulatory cascade as a candidate focus to improve treatment of advanced drug-resistant
ovarian cancers. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8782–91. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide (1). Cisplatin and its analogues are first-line chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of human ovarian
cancer (2, 3). Cisplatin promotes its cytotoxicity by forming
DNA-protein cross-links, DNA mono-adducts, and intrastrand DNA cross-links, which all trigger apoptosis (4, 5).
Although the mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance
are not yet fully understood (6), decreased cellular detoxication (7), increased DNA repair (8), p53 mutations (9), as well
as defects in intracellular or extracellular survival/apoptotic
pathways all have been implicated (10, 11).
Survivin is a bifunctional member of the inhibitor of
apoptosis protein family (12) that participates in cell division control besides being a suppressor of apoptosis (13).
Survivin inhibits apoptosis through binding to caspase-3/7
and inhibits their functions (14). Altered survivin expres-

sion is common in many human cancers, such as ovarian,
lung, colon, liver, prostate, and breast cancers (15–20), and
reducing survivin level sensitizes tumor cells to anticancer
drugs (21). Survivin expression is activated, in part, by
AKT-dependent mechanism in many cell types, including
ovarian cells (22).
AKT is a family of serine/threonine kinases activated in a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–dependent manner by a
variety of stimuli, including growth factors (23). AKT can
suppress apoptosis by inhibiting proapoptotic proteins, such
as BAD, caspase-9, and the transcription factor FKHRL1 (24,
25). AKT deregulation is also involved in the development of
chemoresistance (24, 25). AKT2 is amplified in many human
ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian carcinomas
(26–38), and inhibition of PI3K/AKT2 induces apoptosis in
ovarian cancer cells that overexpress AKT2 (29).
BRCA1-IRIS is a recently discovered 1,399-residue BRCA1
locus splice variant (30). Although it and the full-length
product of this locus, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/p220
(31, 32), share 1,365 residues, unlike BRCA1/p220, BRCA1IRIS possesses oncogenic functions. BRCA1-IRIS induces
DNA replication by inhibiting Geminin-negative function at
DNA replication origins (30) and cell proliferation by upregulating cyclin D1 expression (33, 34). Furthermore, BRCA1-IRIS
expression is high in multiple sporadic human breast and
ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as in known BRCA1mutant/−
cell lines, such as HCC1937 and SNU251 (35, 36).
In the present study, we show that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression triggers survivin expression and ovarian cell survival, in part through triggering the expression and activity of

BRCA1-IRIS Overexpression Induces Cisplatin Resistance

AKT1, AKT2, and NF-κB and in part by repressing PTEN/
FOXO1 and FOXO3a expression. This BRCA1-IRIS-AKTsurvivin cascade was upregulated following treatment of
human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells with low cisplatin concentrations and promoted resistance to cisplatininduced killing. Furthermore, ovarian cancer cell lines
endogenously overexpressing BRCA1-IRIS are more resistant
to cisplatin. Our data suggest that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression is an important mediator of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. We propose that combinatorial targeted
inhibition of the BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin pathway has
the potential to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy
in the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
OV-90, OVCAR-3, and SK-OV-3 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection, and IGROV-1, OVCAR-5,
OVCAR-8, OVCAR-420, and MCAS were a gift from Drs. S.
Mok or R. Drapkin (Harvard Medical School). Immortalized
ovarian surface epithelial cell line (HOSE1) was kindly provided by Dr. Nelly Auersperg (University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), and HOSE2 was a gift
from Dr. S. Mok. These are normal HOSE cells immortalized
with SV40 large T antigen and were grown in medium
containing 45% Medium 199, 45% MCDB105, and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; HyClone). All other cell lines were grown
in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Where
indicated, cisplatin/CDDP dissolved in DMSO (Novaplus, Ben
Venus Laboratories, Inc.) was added.
HOSE cell line generation
Drs. P. Sellers and S. Korsmyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), A. Abbas (University of California, San Francisco), and
D. Alteri (University of Massachusetts) supplied us with the
retroviral-expressing vectors HA-tagged Myr-AKT1, MyrAKT2, and Myr-AKT3; Bcl-2; Bcl-XL; and survivin, respectively. Lentivirus BRCA1-IRIS–expressing vector was constructed
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) cloning into pLenti/
V5-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses produced in 293T cells were immediately added to cells, and cell
lines were selected with appropriate antibiotics.
Small interfering RNA transfection
BRCA1-IRIS small interfering RNA (siRNA) was described
previously (30). AKT siRNA that targets AKT1 and AKT2 (not
AKT3) and survivin siRNA were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cells were transfected with Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Real-time RT-PCR for BRCA1-IRIS, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3,
BRCA1/p220, and survivin and several housekeeping genes
(see Supplementary Table S1) was done using iScript OneStep RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), according to
the manufacturer's instructions.

Immunoblotting
Cells treated with different concentrations of cisplatin or
not were collected in PBS, sonicated three times, cleared by
centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and
immunoblotted using antibodies for survivin, AKT isoform
sampler kit (which contains total and phosphorylated
S473/T308-specific antibodies), phospho–glycogen synthase
kinase 3β (GSK3β; S9)–specific antibody, PTEN (D4.3) XP,
FOXO1 (L27), and FOXO3a (Cell Signaling Technology); Bcl2 (clone 124; Dako Diagnostics AG); Bcl-XL (Transduction
Laboratories); actin (Ab-1, CP01; Oncogene); and phosphosurvivin (T34; Novus Biologicals). Mouse antibody against
BRCA1-IRIS was generated in our laboratory.
MTT and activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 assays
MTT and activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 assays were
done using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) and Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega),
respectively, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were obtained using absorbance at 490 nm. Each experiment was done in eight samples, and the whole
experiment was repeated three separate times.
Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry after
propidium iodide staining using standard protocol.

Results
BRCA1-IRIS, AKT1, AKT2, and survivin are
overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines
Using total RNAs and proteins from two immortalized
human surface epithelial cell lines (HOSE1 and HOSE2)
and several ovarian cancers cell lines, we show using
real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting that all ovarian cancer cell lines, except IGROV-1, express higher levels of
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and protein, respectively, but normal
levels of BRCA1/p220 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1A and B).
Because AKT and survivin are important inducers of drug
resistance in ovarian cancer cells, we examined the levels
of AKT (isoforms 1, 2, and 3) and survivin mRNAs and proteins in these ovarian cancer cell lines. AKT1, AKT2 (not
AKT3), and survivin mRNAs and proteins were also high
in all ovarian cancer cell lines, except IGROV-1 (Fig. 1A
and B), implying co-overexpression of BRCA1-IRIS, AKT,
and survivin in some ovarian cancer cell lines.
Ectopic BRCA1-IRIS expression triggers AKT and
survivin expression and activation
To test the hypothesis that BRCA1-IRIS triggers AKT/
survivin expression in ovarian cells, HOSE1 and HOSE2 cell
lines stably expressing BRCA1-IRIS (HOSE/IRIS), myristoylated
HA-tagged AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 (HOSE/AKT1, HOSE/
AKT2, and HOSE/AKT3), or survivin (HOSE/survivin) were
generated. The data in Fig. 2A to C represent results obtained
using cell lines generated in HOSE1 cells; however, identical
results were obtained using cell lines generated in HOSE2.

Chock et al.

Compared with control, HOSE/survivin showed normal
levels of BRCA1-IRIS and total AKT (detected using panantibody; Fig. 2A). HOSE/AKT1, HOSE/AKT2, and HOSE/
AKT3 showed normal level of BRCA1-IRIS (Fig. 2B) but high
levels of phospho-AKT (detected using a mixture of anti–
phospho-T308 and anti–phospho-S473 antibodies), survivin,
and phospho-survivin (detected using anti–phospho-T34
antibody; Fig. 2B). HOSE/IRIS, on the other hand, showed
high levels of AKT1 and AKT2 (not AKT3), phospho-AKT,
survivin, and phospho-survivin (Fig. 2C). Increase in AKT1,
AKT2 (not AKT3), and survivin mRNA levels was also detected following BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in HOSE1 and
HOSE2 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Taken together,
these data suggest that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression triggers
AKT1, AKT2, and survivin expression and activation.
BRCA1-IRIS–induced survivin expression is partially
AKT dependent
AKT (siRNA silences AKT1 and AKT2), BRCA1-IRIS, survivin, or AKT and BRCA1-IRIS were silenced in SK-OV-3 cells
(endogenously overexpressing all proteins; see Fig. 1B) for 72
hours. Compared with control, AKT silencing had no effect
on BRCA1-IRIS expression, but partially reduced survivin expression (perhaps due to BRCA1-IRIS–related effect; Fig. 2D).
BRCA1-IRIS silencing reduced the expression of AKT1 and
AKT2, and also only partially reduced survivin expression
(perhaps due to an AKT related effect; Fig. 2E). Simultaneous
silencing of BRCA1-IRIS and AKT, like survivin silencing,
completely abolished survivin expression (Fig. 2F and G). Survivin silencing had no effect on BRCA1-IRIS or AKT expression (Fig. 2G). Identical results were obtained using MCAS
cell line. Moreover, the levels of AKT1, AKT2 (not AKT3),
and survivin mRNAs also decreased in SK-OV-3 and MCAS
cells depleted from BRCA1-IRIS (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

Furthermore, AKT silencing in HOSE/IRIS cells (siRNA
targets AKT1 and AKT2) for 72 hours, while completely abolishing AKT expression, only partially decreased survivin
expression (Fig. 2H). These data suggest that BRCA1-IRIS–
induced survivin expression is partially AKT dependent.
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression–induced survivin
expression is partially PI3K/AKT independent
To study this further, MCAS or SK-OV-3 cells were exposed
to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 24 hours or were transfected with BRCA1-IRIS siRNA for 48 hours before they were
exposed to LY294002 and left for another 24 hours. Compared
with untreated cells, although LY294002 alone did not change
the level of total AKT, it decreased the level of phospho-AKT
(Fig. 3A) and survivin in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
treatment of BRCA1-IRIS–silenced cells with LY294002 completely abolished survivin expression (Fig. 3A). These data
suggest that BRCA1-IRIS–induced survivin expression is partially PI3K/AKT independent. Indeed, LY294002 decreased
survivin expression in HOSE/vector cells but had little effect
in HOSE/IRIS cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, our unpublished
data show that silencing of BRCA1-IRIS in HOSE/AKT1 or
HOSE/AKT2 cells (expression driven from heterologous promoter and proteins is myristoylated/activated) reduces the
expression of the exogenous proteins as measured by HA
immunoblotting. The mechanism is still under investigation.
Finally, in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using HOSE1 or SK-OV-3, we found that although
BRCA1-IRIS was bound to the cyclin D1 promoter (known
BRCA1-IRIS target; ref. 35), it was not bound to AKT1,
AKT2, or survivin promoter (data not shown). Moreover,
in cotransfection experiments, BRCA1-IRIS overexpression
did not activate transcription from AKT1, AKT2, and survivin promoter-driven reporter plasmids (data not shown).

BRCA1-IRIS Overexpression Induces Cisplatin Resistance

HOSE cells overexpressing survivin (A), HA-AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 (B), or BRCA1-IRIS (C). Expression of indicated proteins in SK-OV-3 cells silenced
from AKT (D), BRCA1-IRIS (E), AKT and BRCA1-IRIS (F), or survivin (G). H, expression of indicated proteins in HOSE, HOSE/IRIS, or HOSE/IRIS transfected
with AKT siRNA.

Taken together, we propose that BRCA1-IRIS–induced
AKT1 and AKT2 are not transcriptional but posttranscriptional driven (e.g., promotes their mRNA and/or protein
stabilities; see ref. 38), and that survivin expression is
partially induced by BRCA1-IRIS–dependent/PI3K/AKT–
independent mechanism.
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression induces survivin
expression through suppressing PTEN/FOXO1 and
FOXO3a expression
Besides inducing the expression of the known surviving
transcription inducer, NF-κB (Fig. 3C; see also refs. 37, 38),
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in HOSE cells also reduced the
expression of PTEN and its downstream survivin transcription suppressors, FOXO1 and FOXO3a (Fig. 3C; ref. 39). Moreover, BRCA1-IRIS silencing in SK-OV-3 (Fig. 3C) or MCAS
(data not shown) cells derepressed the expression of these
three proteins (Fig. 3C). It is possible that BRCA1-IRIS induces survivin expression by inducing AKT expression and
activation or by suppressing PTEN/FOXO1 and/or FOXO3a
expression. Indeed, when BRCA1-IRIS was silenced in equal
number of HOSE/vector, HOSE/AKT1, or HOSE/AKT2 cells,
the increase in cell number observed following AKT1 and
AKT2 overexpression was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3D, gray
columns). Cosilencing of PTEN restored the increase in cell
number in AKT1- and AKT2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D,
black columns), suggesting that BRCA1-IRIS silencing kills
cells even when AKT1 or AKT2 is overexpressed, most likely
due to increase in PTEN/FOXO1 and FOXO3a expression,
leading to survivin expression decrease.

Low cisplatin concentrations trigger BRCA1-IRIS-AKTsurvivin expression in HOSE cells
Ovarian cancer cells expressing high level of survivin
usually are cisplatin resistant. To investigate whether
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression induces acquired cisplatin resistance, HOSE cells were treated with increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, and survivin
expression was investigated. Compared with untreated
cells, low concentrations of cisplatin (≤50 μmol/L) triggered
BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, and survivin expression (Fig. 4A), whereas
high concentrations (>50 μmol/L) abolished their expression
(Fig. 4A). In FACScan analysis, no G2-M arrest was detected
in HOSE cells treated with any of the cisplatin concentrations used (survivin expression increases in G 2-M cells;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, low cisplatin concentration–
induced survivin expression must be due to the induction in AKT and/or BRCA1-IRIS expression by the same
treatment.
Interestingly, whereas silencing of BRCA1-IRIS in HOSE
cells completely abolished survivin induction by low cisplatin
concentrations (Fig. 4B), AKT silencing only partially blocked
survivin induction by low cisplatin concentrations in HOSE
cells (Fig. 4B), reinforcing the view that BRCA1-IRIS–induced
survivin expression is partially PI3K/AKT independent (see
above). Finally, AKT and survivin were also activated by
low cisplatin concentration treatment, because we observed
phosphorylation of AKT on T308/S437, of its downstream
target, GSK3β, on S9 (Fig. 4C; see ref. 40), and of survivin
on T34 (an event that occurs by cdc2 in viable and proliferating cells; Fig. 4C; see ref. 41).

Ectopic BRCA1-IRIS expression protects HOSE cells
from cisplatin-induced cell death
HOSE/vector, HOSE/IRIS, HOSE/AKT1, HOSE/AKT2, or
HOSE/AKT3 cells were untreated or treated with low (35
μmol/L) or high (70 μmol/L) concentration of cisplatin for
24 hours, and the expression of survivin was measured by
immunoblotting. In untreated HOSE/IRIS, HOSE/AKT1, and
HOSE/AKT2, survivin levels were higher compared with
HOSE/vector cell (Fig. 5A). As expected, treatment of
HOSE/vector and HOSE/AKT3 cells with 35 μmol/L cisplatin
increased survivin expression slightly, whereas 70 μmol/L
cisplatin did not (Fig. 5A). In HOSE/IRIS cells, 35 μmol/L,
and not 70 μmol/L, cisplatin increased BRCA1-IRIS and survivin expression (Fig. 5A). In HOSE/AKT1 and HOSE/AKT2
cells, 35 μmol/L cisplatin did not increase survivin expression and 70 μmol/L actually decreased it slightly (Fig. 5A).
It is possible that BRCA1-IRIS and, to a lesser extent, AKT1
and AKT2 overexpression protects survivin from cisplatininduced downregulation.
Furthermore, HOSE/vector, HOSE/IRIS, HOSE/AKT1,
HOSE/AKT2, HOSE/AKT3, and HOSE/survivin were plated
at equal numbers and incubated with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, or
100 μmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours followed by measurement
of cell viability using MTT assay (Fig. 5C, solid lines) or cell

death using activated caspase-3/7 assay (Fig. 5C, dashed
lines). HOSE/vector or HOSE/AKT3 cells were sensitive to
high cisplatin concentrations, with IC50 of 15 to 20 μmol/L
(Fig. 5C), which coincided with an increase in activated
caspase-3/7 (Fig. 5C). HOSE/IRIS, HOSE/AKT1, HOSE/
AKT2, and HOSE/survivin were resistant to high cisplatin
concentration–induced cell death, and the IC 5 0 was
∼75 μmol/L in these cell lines (Fig. 5C), with low yet measurable levels of active caspase-3/7 detected (Fig. 5C). Taken together, BRCA1-IRIS overexpression protects HOSE cells from
high cisplatin concentration–induced cell death by protecting survivin from cisplatin-induced downregulation.
Endogenous BRCA1-IRIS overexpression protects
ovarian cancer cells from cisplatin-induced cell death
IGROV-1, MCAS, OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3 cell lines were
treated with 0, 35, or 70 μmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours.
IGROV-1 cells showed no detectable expression of BRCA1IRIS, AKT, or survivin proteins even after treatment with
35 or 70 μmol/L cisplatin (Fig. 5B). In contrast, untreated
MCAS, OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3 showed high levels of
BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, and survivin proteins (Fig. 5B). Treatment
with 35 μmol/L cisplatin increased BRCA1-IRIS in all cell
lines (Fig. 5B), did not affect AKT expression in all cell lines

BRCA1-IRIS Overexpression Induces Cisplatin Resistance

(Fig. 5B), and increased (MCAS), had no effect on (OVCAR-5),
or decreased (SK-OV-3) survivin expression (Fig. 5B). BRCA1IRIS, AKT, and survivin levels were significantly reduced by
70 μmol/L cisplatin in all cell lines (Fig. 5B).
Identical numbers of these four cell lines were incubated
with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 μmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours
followed by MTT and active caspase-3/7 assays. As expected,
low viability and high level of active caspase-3/7 were detected in IGROV-1 (Fig. 5C), showing an IC50 of ∼5 μmol/L.
On the other hand, MCAS, OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3 cells expressing high level of BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin were more
resistant to cisplatin-induced activated caspase-3/7 and cell
death (Fig. 5C) and showed IC50 of ∼25 μmol/L for OVCAR-5
and ∼40 μmol/L for MCAS and SK-OV-3 cell lines. Taken together, these data suggest that higher level of BRCA1-IRISAKT1/AKT2 induces persistence survivin expression in the
face of high concentrations of cisplatin and that it protects
ovarian cancer cells against cisplatin-induced cell death.
BRCA1-IRIS silencing sensitizes HOSE cells to cisplatininduced survivin downregulation and cell death
If BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin cascade were important to
protect against cisplatin-induced cell death, one would expect that BRCA1-IRIS depletion would sensitize cells to
cisplatin-induced loss of survivin expression and cell death.
First, HOSE cell lines stably expressing two known survival
factors (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL; Fig. 6C, left; ref. 42) were generated.
HOSE/IRIS, HOSE/AKT1, HOSE/AKT2, HOSE/AKT3, HOSE/
Bcl-2, or HOSE/Bcl-XL cells were transfected with control
(luciferase or scrambled IRIS siRNA) or BRCA1-IRIS–specific
siRNA for 48 hours before treatment with DMSO or cisplatin
(35 or 70 μmol/L) for an additional 24 hours.
BRCA1-IRIS silencing had no effect on the expression of
BRCA1/p220 in HOSE/vector or actin expression in HOSE/
AKT1, HOSE/AKT2, or HOSE/AKT3 cell lines (Fig. 6A, right
and middle). Treatment of HOSE/vector cells with
35 μmol/L cisplatin induced BRCA1-IRIS expression, which
was effectively blocked by BRCA1-IRIS siRNA but had no effect on BRCA1/p220 expression (Fig. 6A, right). BRCA1-IRIS
silencing reduced survivin expression regardless of AKT1,
AKT2, or AKT3 overexpression (Fig. 6A, left). Treatment with
35 μmol/L cisplatin induced survivin expression in vector
and AKT3-expressing cells (Fig. 6A, left), but had no such

www.aacrjournals.org

effect in AKT1- and AKT2-expressing cells (Fig. 6A, left).
Presilencing of BRCA1-IRIS further reduced the level of survivin in all cell lines (Fig. 6A, left). Moreover, these effects
were even more pronounced when cells were treated with
70 μmol/L cisplatin (Fig. 6A, left).
Furthermore, HOSE/Bcl-2 or HOSE/Bcl-XL cell lines were
treated in the same manner except that we tested the effect
of 35 μmol/L cisplatin only. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or BclXL did not protect survivin against BRCA1-IRIS loss-induced,
cisplatin-induced, or both loss- and cisplatin-induced downregulation (Fig. 6C, right). Moreover, an equal number of
HOSE/vector, HOSE/Bcl-2, or HOSE/Bcl-XL cells were transfected with AKT, survivin, or BRCA1-IRIS siRNAs separately
or in combination and then were treated or not with
35 μmol/L cisplatin followed by measurement of cell viability
using MTT assay. Silencing of single molecule had little effect
on HOSE/vector, HOSE/Bcl-2, or HOSE/Bcl-XL cell viability
(Fig. 6D), whereas treatment of single-molecule silenced cells
with cisplatin significantly reduced HOSE cell viability by
∼25% (Fig. 6D). The combination of each two siRNAs reduced the viability by ∼50% (Fig. 6D), suggesting that each
molecule controls overlapping as well as distinct cell survival
and/or proliferation pathways. Adding low concentration of
cisplatin (35 μmol/L) to any of the siRNA combinations decreased cell viability even further to ∼75% (Fig. 6D), suggesting that reducing BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, or survivin expression
(or activity) kills more cells in combination with low cisplatin
concentration.
BRCA1-IRIS downregulation sensitizes ovarian cancer
cell lines to cisplatin-induced survivin downregulation
and cell death
In addition to the intrinsically high levels of BRCA1-IRIS in
ovarian cancer cells, their stress-induced upregulation of
AKT and/or survivin in part through upregulation of
BRCA1-IRIS likely enhances the resistance to cisplatin or other anticancer agents. To test this hypothesis, ovarian cancer
cell lines MCAS, OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3 were transfected
with control or BRCA1-IRIS siRNAs for 72 hours and were
exposed to DMSO or 35 μmol/L cisplatin during the last
24 hours. As expected BRCA1-IRIS silencing downregulated
the expression of AKT1, AKT2, and survivin to various degrees in all cell lines (Fig. 6B). Cisplatin (35 μmol/L) alone

modestly decreased the expression of these proteins (Fig. 6B),
whereas the combination abolished the expression of all proteins in all cell lines (Fig. 6B).
Equal numbers of MCAS and SK-OV-3 cells were transfected with control or BRCA1-IRIS siRNAs for 72 hours and
exposed to DMSO or 35 μmol/L cisplatin during the last
24 hours followed by MTT assay to measure cell viability.
BRCA1-IRIS silencing or treatment with 35 μmol/L cisplatin
decreased cell viability by 25% to 35% in both cell lines
(Fig. 6D), and the combination decreased it by >65%
(Fig. 6D), suggesting that reducing BRCA1-IRIS levels sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to low doses of cisplatin.

Discussion
Here, we showed that BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and protein
are overexpressed in several ovarian cancer cell lines together with the mRNAs and proteins of AKT1, AKT2, and
survivin, and that ectopic expression of BRCA1-IRIS in
HOSE cells induced AKT and survivin protein levels, whereas silencing of BRCA1-IRIS in ovarian cancer cell lines,
overexpressing BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, and survivin (25–27), re-

duced the expression of AKT (1 and 2) and survivin. PI3K
inactivation failed to completely abolish survivin expression
in BRCA1-IRIS–overexpressing HOSE cells, whereas silencing of BRCA1-IRIS cooperated with the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 in completely abolishing survivin expression in
ovarian cancer cell lines overexpressing the protein, suggesting that BRCA1-IRIS activates survivin expression by
a PI3K/AKT-dependent and PI3K/AKT-independent mechanisms or activates AKT by other pathways other than
PI3K. Indeed, our data show that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression can induce survivin expression by upregulating the expression of NF-κB (37, 39) or by suppressing the expression
of PTEN and its downstream transcription suppressors
FOXO1 and FOXO3a (39). Other pathways, such as CKII
(43), mTORC1 and mTORC2 (44, 45), or STAT-3 (46), can
also be considered.
Deregulated survivin expression is associated with a negative prognosis in various cancer types (47, 48). Several
mechanisms have been implicated, including amplification
of survivin locus on 17q25, demethylation of the survivin
exon 1, overexpression of H-Ras, and loss of p53 function
(49, 50). We here add to this list overexpression of

BRCA1-IRIS and propose that this contributes, at least in
part, to the development of aggressive and/or drug-resistant
ovarian cancers. Many studies on clinical specimens have
shown that survivin expression is associated with resistance
to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and linked to poor prognosis, suggesting that cancer cells survive with survivin. It is
tempting to speculate that because BRCA1-IRIS overexpression upregulates survivin expression, it plays a fundamental
role in the development of (acquired) drug resistance and/or
recurrent ovarian cancer.
In fact, in the current study, the anticancer drug cisplatin
reduced survivin expression in ovarian cancer cells only
when administrated at concentrations above 50 μmol/L.
Concentrations below 50 μmol/L triggered survivin expression, which we showed following the upregulation in
BRCA1-IRIS by the same treatment. These finding have significant clinical implication because they provide direct evidence that anticancer agents can itself trigger prosurvival
events in ovarian cancer cells that attenuate their therapeutic efficacy. Further studies will be necessary to determine
whether cisplatin upregulates BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin expression cascade in vivo and whether this is implicated in
the development of the deadly ovarian cancer recurrence.
Tumor cells differ from normal cells by aberrant cell cycle
progression, resistant to growth-inhibitory signals and insensitive DNA damage checkpoints. These abnormalities can be
the result of overexpression of a proto-oncogene(s) even in
the face of reduced or absence of growth factors. Constitutive
oncogene activation might play a key role in carcinogenesis
and tumor progression; this phenomenon is known as oncogene addiction. BRCA1-IRIS-AKT-survivin pathway might
represent such an oncogenic pathway in human ovarian
cells. In fact, we showed that ovarian cancer cells overexpressing BRCA1-IRIS were more sensitive to cisplatin-induced
cell death than HOSE cells, raising the interesting possibility
that BRCA1-IRIS, at least in this setting, might act as a fatedetermining factor because those ovarian cancer cells are
already addicted to it. The question that remains to be
answered is how BRCA1-IRIS expression is induced in cancer

cell. Although speculative at the moment, our recent data1
show a cross talk between BRCA1/p220 mutation/low expression and BRCA1-IRIS overexpression by a posttranscriptional mechanism.
Our working hypothesis is that cells in an ovarian tumor
mass are exposed to different concentration of any given
drug, depending on factors such as the distance the drug travels in the circulation before reaching the mass, the diffusion
rate of the drug to the inside of the mass, etc. It is likely that
the cells in the inner core of this tumor mass are exposed
to the least concentration of the drug. If this triggers
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression followed by AKT and/or survivin
overexpression, then this could lead to the production of
drug-insensitive tumor cells that may initiate the recurrence.
Whether BRCA1-IRIS is a critical target for ovarian cancer
chemointervention remains an open question. The fact that
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression upregulated survivin expression
in normal ovarian epithelial cells and survivin antiapoptotic
activity in ovarian cell lines is maintained by BRCA1-IRIS
and/or AKT pathways, especially following treatment with
a chemotherapeutic drug, adds support to that hypothesis.
In this context, BRCA1-IRIS silencing should increase cell
death in ovarian cancer cells and sensitized cells to apoptosis
induced by low concentrations of cisplatin.
