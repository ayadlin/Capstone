BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of race on outcome in patients
with stage III/IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who have completed concurrent
chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 202 patients with stage
III/IV SCCHN who were treated at the University of Maryland. Patients received daily radiation to a total
dose of 70.2 Gray (Gy) (1.8 Gy/day), concurrently with weekly carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] ¼
2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) chemotherapy. RESULTS: There were 108 Caucasian (CA) and 94 African
American (AA) patients. The median age was 56 years, and 81% were stage IV. The median follow-up was
33 months. The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 33 months and 19
months, respectively. When analyzed by race, the median DFS was 33 months (CA) versus 12 months (AA)
(P ¼.028). The median OS was 44 months (CA) versus 24 months (AA) (P ¼.071). The 3-year DFS for stage
IV AA versus stage IV CA was 29% versus 50% (P ¼.031). The 3-year DFS for N2 disease in AA versus CA
was 32% versus 51% (P ¼.046). The 3-year DFS for AA versus CA with oropharyngeal tumors was 30% versus 60% (P ¼.006). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis documents the inferior outcome for AA patients. They had
inferior DFS and a trend toward worse OS. When stratified by several prognostic variables, the mediocre DFS
in the AA patients remains. These data suggest that further investigation into the genetic characteristics of

developing SCCHN, with the most significant
being tobacco use, heavy alcohol abuse,6 or human
papillomavirus16 infection.7 In addition, patients who
continue to smoke or consume more than 14 alcoholic
drinks per week have a 2-fold risk and a 50% increased
risk of developing a second primary SCCHN,
respectively.8
Cancer incidence and death rates differ widely
among racial and ethnic groups. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program
of the National Cancer Institute 2006 review have indicated that African American (AA) men have, for all cancer
sites combined, a 15% higher incidence rate and 38%
higher death rate compared with white men.9 Particularly,
AAs have a higher incidence rate of SCCHN, are more
likely to present with advanced disease, and demonstrate
diminished survival compared with Caucasians (CAs).9
There are no definitive biologic data to explain the poor
prognosis of AA with SCCHN. Several hypotheses have
been presented to explain these differences in survival.
These include socioeconomic status, lack of insurance,
advanced stage at presentation, genetic predisposition to
more aggressive disease, and increased exposure to known
risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol.10,11 The literature contains a limited number of single institution series
from the United States evaluating the impact of race on
treatment outcomes for patients with SCCHN.
To date, there are no data evaluating the impact of
race on treatment outcomes in a homogeneous cohort of
patients with SCCHN who have received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The purpose of our retrospective analysis
was to evaluate whether the AA race negatively impacts
outcome in patients with stage III/IV SCCHN, treated at
a single institution, who received uniform concurrent
chemoradiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
From November 1995 through July 2006, roughly 2000
patients with SCCHN were treated at the University of
Maryland. Patients with AJCC stage III/IV squamous cell
carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
and larynx who had long-term follow-up were identified.
For the purpose of this retrospective analysis, a homogeCancer

neous cohort of 202 patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for curative intent was selected. One
hundred and eight (53%) patients were non-AA (98% of
which were CA), and 94 (47%) patients were AA. All
patients had previously untreated SCCHN with no evidence of distant metastases. The characteristics of the
patients are shown in Table 1. The majority of patients
were presented to a multidisciplinary conference and evaluated by a surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical
oncologist before therapy.
Workup
Baseline evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination, pretreatment panendoscopy with documentation
of tumor extent, basic blood work, electrocardiogram, and
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, neck, and
chest. After 2002, positron emission tomography (PET)/
CT scans were routinely ordered. Pretherapy dental evaluation was required before the start of chemoradiation. Gastrostomy feeding tubes were placed endoscopically in all
patients who were felt to be at significant risk for nutritional
compromise as a result of therapy.
Treatment
The majority of patients (96%) received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Of these patients, 79% received weekly
carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] ¼ 2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2). The remaining (21%) chemotherapy
regimens were roughly divided between cisplatin 100 mg/
m2 every 3 weeks or weekly paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) and
capecitabine (Xeloda) (500 mg twice daily, Mondays-Fridays). Baseline absolute neutrophil counts and records of
possible chemotherapy reductions were not complete and
therefore, not included in this study.
Radiation was delivered at 1.8 Gray (Gy) per day, 5
days a week, to a total dose of 70.2 Gy to areas of gross disease. Initial treatment fields encompassed the primary tumor plus a 2-cm margin, all clinically involved nodal
disease, and draining lymphatics felt to be at risk for harboring microscopic disease. Uninvolved nodal sites
received 50 Gy. The primary tumor and palpable nodes
were included to the final dose of 70.2 Gy. All patients
were treated on linear accelerators with either 4- or 6-MV
photon beams. The treatment technique used shaped parallel-opposed lateral fields with doses prescribed to midplane,

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software
(version 13.0; Chicago, Ill). Survival data, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were calculated using the Kaplan-Meir product limit method. OS
was defined as death from any cause, known or unknown.
DFS was defined as death from any cause, known or
unknown, and time at recurrence. Factors included in
univariate and multivariate analysis were primary site
location, T stage, N stage, overall American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2003 stage, overall treatment
time <55 days and 55 days, weight loss <10% body
weight and 10% body weight, prior tobacco use, continued tobacco use after completion of therapy, prior alcohol
abuse defined as >2 drinks/day, and continued alcohol
abuse after the completion of therapy. The log-rank test
was used to detect the statistical difference in estimates
between strata of the selected factors above. Multivariate
analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. P.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Two hundred and two patients were evaluated, with a median active follow-up of 33 months. The median patient age
was 56 years (range, 36-86 years). Fifty-three percent of
patients were CA, and 47% were AA. Eighty-five percent of
the patients were men. Nineteen percent of the patients
were AJCC stage III, and 81% of the patients were AJCC
stage IV, with no difference in stage at presentation between
the 2 racial cohorts. Ninety-seven percent of patients were
able to complete the prescribed therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in mean or percentage weight
loss during treatment between CA and AA patients
(P ¼ .418). However, 58% of CA experienced 10%
weight loss versus 41% of AA patients. The average overall
treatment time was 59 days for CA patients and 58 days for
AA patients. There was no statistically significant difference
in average overall treatment time, treatment completed in
<55 days, or treatment completed in 55 days between
CA and AA patients (P ¼ .785). The patient characteristics
were well balanced between the 2 racial groups, with the

exception of a statistically significant difference in site, prior
tobacco use, and prior alcohol abuse. Specifically, there
were more hypopharyngeal carcinomas, prior smokers, and
prior alcohol abusers in the AA cohort. However, when controlling for anatomic subsite, there was no difference in
DFS between the hypopharynx and the oral cavity or laryngeal subsites. There was a statistically significant difference
in DFS between hypopharyngeal tumors and oropharyngeal
tumors (median survival [MS] 9 months and 33 months,
respectively; P ¼ .003).
At the time of analysis, 86 patients were alive, and
116 were dead. Of the 116 deaths, 17 were of unknown
cause, and 5 patients died during or within 1 week of
completing therapy. Thirty-five percent of CA patients
died of their disease versus 47% of AA patients
(P ¼ .062).
Patterns of Failure
Ninety-five of the 202 patients had recurrence of their disease after completion of therapy. Forty-six (43%) CA
patients developed recurrent disease, and the median time
to recurrence was 10 months. Forty-nine (52%) AA
patients recurred, and the median time to recurrence was
8 months. Table 2 describes the type of initial failure.
There was no significant difference in the type of initial
failure between the CA and AA patients.
Disease-free Survival
The median DFS and 3-year DFS for all patients were 19
months and 39%, respectively. On univariate analysis,

significant for predicting a poor outcome. A prior smoking history approached statistical significance (P ¼ .063).
The variables AJCC stage (P ¼ .255), differentiation
(P ¼ .101), weight loss (P ¼ .391), nodal stage
(P ¼ .415), and overall treatment time (P ¼ .179) were
not statistically significant. When analyzed by race, the
median DFS was 33 months in CA patients versus 12
months in AA patients (P ¼ .028). The 3-year DFS was
47% in CA patients versus 29% in AA patients (Fig. 1).
The 3-year DFS based on race, stratified by known prognostic variables, is listed in Table 3. When controlling for
the listed 8 prognostic variables in Table 3, there is a
strong correlation between the AA race and a significantly
worse DFS.
1748

To control for the imbalance of primary site location
and prior smoking history within the 2 racial cohorts,
DFS was further analyzed in 106 patients with stage III/
IV oropharyngeal carcinomas who were all previous
smokers. Patient characteristics were well balanced
between the CA and AA cohorts, with the exception of a
statistically significant (P ¼ .048) increase in prior alcohol
abusers in the AA cohort. The median DFS was 61
months in CA patients versus 15 months in AA patients
(P ¼ .021). The 3-year DFS was 57% in CA patients versus 28% in AA patients (Fig. 2). Thirty-four percent of
CA patients died from their disease versus 49% of AA
patients (P ¼ .084). When controlled for a prior alcohol
abuse history, AA patients continued to display a worse 3year DFS (20% vs 53%, P ¼ .003), as seen in Figure 3.

Overall Survival
Given the poor DFS in the AA cohort, its impact on OS
was evaluated. The median OS and 3-year OS for all
patients were 33 months and 48%, respectively. On univariate analysis, T3/T4 disease (P ¼ .003) and site (hypopharynx and oral cavity, P ¼ <.01) were predictors of
worse OS. Race approached statistical significance
(P ¼ .071). The variables AJCC stage (P ¼ .815), nodal
stage (P ¼ .300), differentiation (P ¼ .185), prior smoking history (P ¼ .136), weight loss (P ¼ .295), and overall

outcome. The median OS based on race was 44 months
in CA patients versus 24 months in AA patients (Fig. 4).
The 3-year OS was 56% in CA patients versus 36% in
AA patients. On univariate analysis, race was stratified
by known prognostic variables, and the 3-year OS survival
is listed in Table 4. There was a strong correlation and
trend toward poor outcome in the AA patients when controlling for site, differentiation, AJCC stage, and overall

In this retrospective analysis, the AA race was found to
be a poor prognostic factor in patients with stage III/IV
SCCHN who received uniform concurrent chemoradiotherapy. These individuals had a statistically significant
decrease in DFS and a trend toward reduced OS. There
have been numerous hypotheses published as to the etiology of this racial disparity.10-15 Specifically, factors
such as socioeconomic status, unequal cancer directed
therapy, and advanced stage of presentation have been
sited as an explanation for the poor outcomes in AA
patients.14-15
In 2006, Gourin and Podolsky published data
from a nonrandomized retrospective cohort analysis to
determine whether racial disparities exist between black
and white patients with SCCHN treated at a single large
institution in the South.10 Their AA patients were more
likely to be younger, have an advanced stage of presentation, have a previous history of alcohol abuse, lack insurance, have a lower mean education level, and have a
lower median income as compared with the CA patients.
They found that only insurance status had a significant
effect on survival in the AA patients after controlling for
other variables, suggesting that racial differences in outcome were primarily related to differences in access to
healthcare. Their paper suggested that equal access to
healthcare is able to even out outcomes. Murdock and
Gluckman16 sought to evaluate the characteristics of AA
1749

patients and CA patients with SCCHN at the University
of Cincinnati Medical Center, which is an equal-access
facility. They reported that twice as many AA patients
presented with stage IV disease. The average death rate
over time was about twice as great for AA patients. Death
from disease-specific causes occurred in 75% of the AA
patients versus 25% of CA patients.
In 2007, Nichols and Bhattacharyya performed a
retrospective analysis on AA and CA patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue and glottis
obtained from the SEER database.11 For each AA patient,
a randomly selected CA control was matched for age at diagnosis, sex, stage, surgical treatment, and radiation. They
found that when controlling for stage and treatment, the
AA patients demonstrated poorer overall and disease-specific survival, suggesting other intrinsic or extrinsic factors
influencing survival. Al-Othman et al17 from The University of Florida reported their assessment of the impact of
race on the outcome of patients with SCCHN who have
received definitive radiotherapy. Their population characteristics were well balanced; 80% of the patients presented
with stage III/IV disease, twice-daily radiotherapy was
delivered (no difference between races in median dose
delivered of roughly 76 Gy), and 1=3 of patients underwent
a planned unilateral neck dissection. Their data revealed
equal locoregional control rates but the risk of distant metastases (DM) was significantly higher in AA patients.
This translated into statistically significantly worse causespecific and absolute survival rates in AA patients.
In this analysis, we sought to evaluate the majority
of extrinsic and intrinsic factors previously sited to influence survival in racial groups. Our study was centered on
2 homogenous racial cohorts that were balanced in terms
of AJCC stage at presentation, average age and overall
treatment time, mean weight loss during therapy, and tumor differentiation. Weight loss and overall treatment
time (thus, accounting for treatment breaks) were provided as surrogate markers of treatment tolerance. There
was no difference between AA and CA patients when
accounting for either of these variables. Eighty-five percent of our patients were men, which is consistent with
the University of Florida patient population.17 The numbers are too small to make a conjecture as to whether sex
influenced survival in this particular series. However,
Neville and Day18 published data on age-adjusted mortality rates for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx from
1750

1950 to 1995. AA and CA women had equivalent mortality rates, whereas the mortality rate for AA men has significantly worsened.
Although we did not account for insurance status
and pretreatment comorbidities, the majority of patients
(>95%) received and completed concurrent chemoradiotherapy at a single institution. In contrast to the study by
Gourin and Podolsky,10 uniform therapy and equivalent
access to cancer treatment did not equalize outcomes in
this analysis. Our AA patients were more likely to be
smokers and heavy drinkers as compared with our CA
cohort. This has been substantiated in previous studies,
including that of Day et al,13 who evaluated data from a
large, population-based case-control study of oral cancer
risk factors conducted in 4 areas of the United States.
They found that AA patients were more likely to smoke
and abuse alcohol compared with the CA patients in their
population of SCCHN.
In addition to inferior DFS and a trend toward a
worse OS, our AA patients had a higher recurrence rate
(52% vs 43%) and were more likely to die from their disease (47% vs 35%). The small number of patients likely
influenced these outcomes, as they only approached but
did not reach statistical significance. There was no statistical difference in the type of initial failure; however, the
AA patients had a higher rate of DM disease (43% vs
30%). Again, it is plausible that the small patient numbers prevented statistical significance from being
achieved. When controlling for tobacco and heavy alcohol use, the AA patients continued to have a worse DFS.
Our AA cohort had more hypopharyngeal and fewer laryngeal carcinomas that the CA patients. Carter et al19
recently presented data indicating the laryngeal/oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal/oral cavity sites as independent favorable and unfavorable prognostic factors,
respectively, with regards to DFS and OS. To control for
the influence of site, prior smoking, and alcohol use, a
matched cohort of AA and CA patients with stage III/IV
oropharyngeal carcinoma was evaluated. The data were
striking; the AA patients had significantly worse 3-year
DFS (20% vs 53%, P ¼ .003) and 3-year OS (27% vs
67%, P ¼ .003).
Our data are highly suggestive of the AA race, particularly men, being an independent poor prognostic
variable. At this time, there have been no definitive data
published to support a more biologically aggressive

tumor or a genetic predisposition to more aggressive disease as explanations for the poor outcomes in AA
patients. Could individual biologic differences account
for the variability in outcome? Although AA patients are
identified as presenting with more locally advanced disease and having poorer outcomes than their non-AA
counterparts, race may still be a crude prognostic
marker. In an editorial published in the New England
Journal of Medicine,20 Dr. M. Gregg Bloche cautions
physicians against using race as a marker for genetic variation. Although his commentary is directed at the data
presented in the African-American Heart Failure Trial
published in the same issue, he makes several important
points that can be applied to the oncology world. The
most important argument being that within the AA race
or any ethnic grouping such as ‘‘Caucasian,’’ ‘‘Latino,’’
or ‘‘Asian,’’ there is genetic heterogeneity. However, the
ultimate answer lies within a well-designed, prospective
study focused on evaluating molecular characteristics
that may help differentiate between CA and AA patients
with locally advanced SCCHN.

Conclusions
This retrospective analysis documents the inferior outcome for AA patients as compared with their CA counterparts. The AA patients had inferior DFS and a trend
toward worse OS. The homogenous cohort selected
reduces confounding variables such as disparate treatments received or socioeconomic status. When stratified
by several established prognostic variable such as AJCC
stage, T stage, N stage, site of disease, differentiation,
overall treatment time, weight loss during therapy, and
previous smoking history, the mediocre DFS in the AA
patients remains.
Although phenotype alone cannot explain the biological nature of cancer, it may be a stepping stone to evaluating genetic distinctions within AA patients. Our data
suggest that intrinsic differences between AA and CA may
result in poor outcomes. Further investigation into the
molecular and cytogenetic characteristics of SCCHN in
the AA patient population is warranted.
