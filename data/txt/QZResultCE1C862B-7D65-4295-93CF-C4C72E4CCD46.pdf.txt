Endocrine Fibroblast Growth Factor FGF19 Promotes
Prostate Cancer Progression

Abstract
Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
US men. There is broad evidence that ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors are important in prostate
cancer initiation and progression, but the contribution of particular FGFs in this disease is not fully
understood. The FGF family members FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 comprise a distinct subfamily that circulate
in serum and act in an endocrine manner. These endocrine FGFs require a-Klotho (KL) and/or b-Klotho
(KLB), two related single-pass transmembrane proteins restricted in their tissue distribution, to act as
coreceptors along with classic FGF receptors (FGFR) to mediate potent biologic activity. Here we show
that FGF19 is expressed in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissues, where it functions as an autocrine
growth factor. Exogenous FGF19 promoted the growth, invasion, adhesion, and colony formation of prostate
cancer cells at low ligand concentrations. FGF19 silencing in prostate cancer cells expressing autocrine
FGF19 decreased invasion and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Consistent with these
observations, KL and/or KLB were expressed in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, raising the possibility
that additional endocrine FGFs may also exert biologic effects in prostate cancer. Our ﬁndings support
the concept that therapies targeting FGFR signaling may have efﬁcacy in prostate cancer and highlight
FGF19 as a relevant endocrine FGF in this setting. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2551–62. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men, affecting 1 in 9 men over 65 years of age. Currently,
there is no effective cure for advanced stages of prostate cancer
and it is the second-leading cause of male cancer mortality.
Identiﬁcation of novel endogenous factors responsible for
proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer will
facilitate the understanding of the biology of prostate cancer
progression and the development of new approaches for the
diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
The human ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) family is composed of 22 structurally related polypeptides. The FGF genes
can be divided into 3 major groups (see ref. 1 for review).
FGF1-10, 16–18, 20 and 22 are classical FGFs. They are mitogens that bind strongly to heparin, which is abundant in the
extracellular microenvironment, so these FGFs tend to act

locally. FGFs 11 to 14 are not secreted mitogens and they
appear to modulate electrical excitability and as such do not
appear to play a role in cancer. A major new discovery in the
last decade is the characterization of the endocrine FGFs
(FGF15/19, FGF21, and FGF23). FGF15 is the mouse homolog
of human FGF19 and has analogous functions in mice. This
subfamily is secreted into serum and they are stable in this
environment, which allows them to act in an endocrine fashion
(2). Another common feature shared by this atypical FGF
family is their requirement for a-Klotho (KL) and/or b-Klotho
(KLB), 2 related single-pass transmembrane proteins with a
restricted tissue distribution for potent biologic activity (3).
Both KL and KLB act as coreceptors with the classic FGF
receptors (FGFR) in relevant target tissues to facilitate the
FGF–FGFR interaction for endocrine FGFs. The tissue-speciﬁc
actions of the endocrine FGFs are thus modulated by the
presence of their speciﬁc coreceptors since one or more FGFRs
are expressed in most cells. Endocrine FGF subfamily members
regulate diverse physiologic processes, namely, energy metabolism and bile acid homeostasis (FGF19; refs. 4–5), glucose and
lipid metabolism (FGF21; ref. 6), and phosphate and vitamin D
homeostasis (FGF23; ref. 7).
The only endocrine FGF that has been examined in cancer is
FGF19. Before the identiﬁcation of the KL/KLB binding partners for this subfamily, it was reported that FGF19 displays
binding speciﬁcity for FGFR4 at relatively high concentrations
(2, 8); however, studies in HEK293 and L6 cells show that in the
presence of KLB, FGF19 binds and signals through multiple
FGFRs (9), with FGFR1 and FGFR4 being more potent than
FGFR2 or FGFR3. KL can also act as a coreceptor for FGF19

(10–11), although the exact FGFR speciﬁcity has not been
determined. Although FGF19 was ﬁrst reported to be
expressed in a colon adenocarcinoma cell line a decade ago
(8), its relevance to cancer had not been evident until it was
discovered that the transgenic mice overexpressing FGF19 in
skeletal muscle develop hepatocellular carcinoma (12), which
presumably reﬂects an endocrine action of the increased levels
of circulating FGF19. FGF19 has been found to be coexpressed
in a subgroup of primary human liver, colonic and lung
squamous carcinomas and in a subset of human colon cancer
cell lines (13). An anti-FGF19 monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of FGF19 with FGFR4 inhibits
growth of colon tumor xenografts in vivo and effectively
prevents hepatocellular carcinomas in FGF19 transgenic mice.
The efﬁcacy of the antibody in these models is linked to the
inhibition of FGF19-dependent activation of FGFR4 and downstream targets FRS2, ERK, and b-catenin (14). The inactivation
of FGF19 could be beneﬁcial for the treatment of malignancies
involving the interaction of FGF19 and FGFRs.
All FGF ligands, including endocrine FGFs, signal through 4
highly conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors
(FGFR1–4) with differential afﬁnity for various FGF ligands.
FGFR signaling has been strongly implicated in prostate
tumorigenesis (15). Our laboratory has shown that FGFR1 is
expressed in clinically localized prostate cancers based on
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis of
prostate cancer extracts (16). Studies in transgenic mice have
shown that chronic FGFR1 activation can lead to adenocarcinoma and epithelial–mesenchymal transition of the cancer
cells (17). We (18) and others (19–21) have shown that there is
increased expression of FGFR4 in prostate cancer by IHC and
this has been conﬁrmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
Strong FGFR4 expression is signiﬁcantly associated with poor
clinical outcome (19, 21). For example, recent work by Murphy
and colleagues (21) has shown that increased FGFR4 expression is strongly associated with prostate cancer-speciﬁc death
as compared with decreased expression of the FGFR signaling
inhibitor Sef. Thus both correlative studies in human tissues
and mouse models strongly support the concept that FGFR1
and FGFR4 both play an important role in prostate cancer.
Our group has previously shown that FGF19 is expressed as a
paracrine factor in prostate cancer reactive stroma based on
analysis of laser-captured normal and prostate cancer stroma
(22). However, to date, the role of FGF19 in prostate cancer has
not been comprehensively addressed. Our data indicates that
FGF19 is expressed in prostate cancer and that FGF19 signaling
plays an important role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and
progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human prostate cancer cells PC3, LNCaP, DU145, and
VCaP and the immortalized normal prostate PNT1a cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Cell lines were authenticated by STR analysis
at MD Anderson Cancer Center Characterized Cell Line Core
Facility (Houston, TX).

Prostate and prostate cancer tissues
Tissue samples were obtained from Baylor Prostate Cancer
Program Tissue Bank and were collected from fresh radical
prostatectomy specimens after obtaining informed consent
under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Laser
capture of epithelial and stromal RNAs from frozen tissues was
carried out as described previously (22). Parafﬁn-embedded
tissues from these specimens were used to construct small
tissue microarrays for immunohistochemistry.
Transfection
Two human GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir individual clones
(V2LHS_50187 and V2LHS_50189) targeting FGF19 and the
GIPZ vector clone obtained from Open Biosystems were
transiently transfected into PC3 and DU145 cells with
FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche) in triplicate in 6-well
plates according to manufacturer's instructions. Stable
FGF19 knockdown cell lines were generated by infecting
PC3 cells with the 2 FGF19 GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir types
and selecting with 1 mg/mL puromycin in growth medium.
GIPZ vector was used to produce the vector control PC3
cells.
Cell proliferation assays
To examine the effect of exogenous FGF19, cells were
incubated with different concentrations of recombinant
FGF19 (R&D Systems) for 48 or 72 hours in serum-free
medium. The effect of FGF19 knockdown on PC3 and
DU145 cell proliferation was assessed using FGF19 shRNA
transient transfection. In brief, DU145 and PC3 cells were
plated in 96-well plates, transfected with FGF19 shRNAs,
and 48 hours later cell proliferation was measured. Viable
cell number was determined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) as
described by the manufacturer. Cell viability at 72 hours
was assessed by counting viable and nonviable cells based
on Trypan blue staining. For stable PC3 FGF19 knockdown
cells, cell proliferation was determined using a Coulter
counter.
Soft agar colony formation assay
Cell suspensions of 5,000 cells/mL were prepared in 0.35%
agar diluted in growth medium and plated on a 0.6% agar
foundation in 6-well culture plates with different doses of
FGF19, 50 ng/mL FGF2 or vehicle only, and 20 U/mL heparin
at 37 C. After culture for 14 days, the cells were stained with 2
mg/mL of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma) and colonies
were counted with a dissecting microscope.
Cell adhesion assays
Cells were grown in 6-well plates to 80% conﬂuence, starved with serum-free RPMI-1640 for 24 hours, and then incubated with a variety of concentrations of FGF19 or vehicle
in serum-free medium in the presence of 20 U/mL heparin at
37 C for 48 hours. The cells were then detached with 0.25%
trypsin-EDTA, washed with PBS twice, resuspended in serumfree medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, counted and
seeded with a density of 6  104 per well into 96-well plates

precoated with 10 ng/mL type I collagen (Sigma) or 1:200
diluted Matrigel (R&D Systems) followed by preblocking with
1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 37 C for 1 hour,
unbound cells were washed away and the number of cells was
quantitated with CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay.
Matrigel invasion assays
To evaluate the effect of FGF19 on cell invasion, we conducted invasion assays using BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion
chambers (Becton Dickinson). After incubation with 25
ng/mL of FGF19 or vehicle only and 20 U/mL of heparin for
24 hours (PC3), 36 hours (DU145), or 72 hours (LNCaP and
PNT1a), noninvading cells in the top chambers were removed
and the invading cells on the bottom surface of the membrane
were ﬁxed and stained with Diff–Quik stain. The membranes
were mounted on slides, scanned, and photographed, and all
cells were counted.
Xenograft tumors
Male nude mice were injected over each ﬂank with either
PC3 with FGF19 knockdown or vector controls cell (2  106
cells/site). Tumor volume was measured twice weekly using
calipers. All procedures were carried out in accordance with
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved
protocol.
RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR
To examine expression of FGF19, KL, KLB, or FGFR4
mRNA in human prostate cancer cell lines and/or patient
prostate cancer and benign prostate samples, we carried out
RT-PCR or quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total
RNA was extracted from cell lines using the RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using an iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) with a blend of Oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers. qRT-PCR was conducted according
to a qPCR SybrGreen real-time protocol on the IQ5 iCycler.
Primer sequences and PCR conditions are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. All data were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression.
Each measurement point was repeated at least in triplicate
for 3 samples and the average and standard deviation were
calculated. HPRT was used as a control mRNA.
Western blot
Total cellular protein lysate was prepared as described
previously (23). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer
containing Tris 50 mmol/L, NaCl 150 mmol/L, Triton X-100 1%,
SDS 0.1%, deoxycholate 0.5%, sodium orthovanadate 2 mmol/L,
sodium pyrophosphate 1 mmol/L, NaF 50 mmol/L, EDTA 5
mmol/L, PMSF 1 mmol/L, and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) and clariﬁed by centrifugation. Protein concentration
of the lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay
Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Forty micrograms of the extracted
protein from each sample was subjected to electrophoresis in
10% to 15% SDS PAGE, dependent on the molecular weight of
the proteins to be analyzed. Proteins in the gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes

(Invitrogen) and subjected to Western blot analysis with different antibodies. The antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology Inc. and included: phospho-FRS2 (Tyr196) rabbit
polyclonal antibody; phospho-p44/42 MAPK (p-Erk1/2)
rabbit mAb; p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2); phospho-p38 MAPK
(Thr180/Tyr182) rabbit mAb; phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221)
rabbit mAb; MEK1/2 rabbit mAb; phospho-AKT (Ser473) rabbit mAb; phospho-AKT (Thr308) rabbit mAb; and total AKT
rabbit mAb. All were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. A goat polyclonal
anti-b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) was utilized at
1:1,000 as loading control. After incubation with primary antibodies for overnight at 4 C or for 1 hour at room temperature,
horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies were
then applied to the membranes for 1 hour at room temperature.
Signals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
Western blot analysis detection reagents (Thermo).
Immunohistochemistry
FGF19 IHC was carried out using the general procedures
described previously (24). Antigen retrieval was carried out in
Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0 for 20 minutes in steamer followed by 20
minutes cooling at room temperature. Anti-FGF19 antibody
(R&D Systems, mouse monoclonal, catalog number MAB969)
was incubated with sections at a 1:1,200 dilution at 4 C
overnight. Detection was carried out at room temperature
using a PolyVue Polymer detection system (Diagnostic BioSystems) according to manufacturer's directions. The positive
control was parafﬁn-embedded DU145 cells and the negative
control was PNT1a cells. An additional negative control included incubation of prostate tissues with no primary antibody.
Immunohistochemistry for KL was conducted as for FGF19
except primary antibody (Calbiochem, rabbit polyclonal, catalog number 423500) that was incubated at 1:100 overnight at
4 C. Positive control was normal kidney. Negative control was
carried out with no primary antibody for both kidney and
prostate tissue.
FGF19 ELISA
FGF19 expression in stable shRNA-mediated FGF19 gene
knockdown PC3 cells was quantiﬁed by ELISA. Cell lysates
were prepared as described above for Western blot. Protein
concentration were determined using the BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo) and equal amounts of protein lysates were
subjected to ELISA for FGF19 (R&D Systems, catalog number
DF1900) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Gene expression analysis
KL mRNA levels were examined in various public expression
datasets, including the "Expo" dataset (GEO accession number
GSE2109), of cancers from various histologic subtypes, and the
Roth and colleagues (25) dataset, of various normal tissues
(GSE3526), as well as 4 different prostate cancer versus benign
tissue datasets, via Oncomine (26).
Statistical analysis
Numerical values were compared using the t test or the
Mann–Whitney test as appropriate. Differences were considered signiﬁcant if P < 0.05.

Results
Expression of FGF19 in human prostate cancer cell lines
We analyzed FGF19 expression in the commonly used
prostate cancer cell lines PC3, LNCaP, DU145, and VCaP, as
well as an immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell line
PNT1a. qRT-PCR indicates that FGF19 mRNA is expressed in
DU145, PC3, and VCaP cells, whereas it is undetectable in
LNCaP and PNT1a cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, in 3 of 4 prostate cancer
cell lines, there is upregulation of FGF19 signaling relative to
the PNT1a immortalized normal epithelial cells.
Expression of Klotho coreceptors in human prostate
cancer cell lines
The KL gene is expressed in all 5 cell lines tested including
normal PNT1a cells, although at the lowest level in PC3 cells.
KLB is expressed in DU145 and VCaP cells, but it is not detected
in PC3, LNCaP, and PNT1a cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Thus 2 of
the 4 prostate cancer cell lines express KLB, which is not
expressed in the normal prostatic epithelial cell line, whereas
KL is ubiquitously expressed in both normal and neoplastic
prostatic epithelial cells lines.
Effect of FGF19 on prostate cancer cells in vitro
Given that Klotho coreceptors are expressed on prostate
and prostate cancer cell lines, we sought to determine the
effects of exogenous FGF19 on these cells in vitro. To

FGF19 promotes anchorage independent growth
PC3 and LNCaP cell lines were plated with different concentrations of FGF19 in soft agar and colony formation quantiﬁed after 14 days. As shown in Fig. 2B, cells treated with
FGF19 formed more colonies in soft agar than vehicle controls
and colony numbers were similar to those seen in FGF2-treated
cells, indicating that FGF19 promotes anchorage-independent
growth capacity in vitro.
FGF19 stimulates prostate cancer cell adhesion
The migration of cancer cells is critically regulated by
physical adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, which
is one of the early steps in tumor dissemination (29).
Therefore, we investigated whether FGF19 stimulates prostate cancer cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix component type I collagen (COLI) or Matrigel. Cells were preincubated with a variety of concentrations of FGF19 for 48
hours and then subjected to adhesion assay in 96-well plates
precoated with COLI or 1:200 dilution of Matrigel. As seen
in Fig. 2C, FGF19 signiﬁcantly enhances PC3 and DU145 cells
adhesion on both type I collagen and Matrigel even at
concentrations as low as 0.25 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL.

evaluate the effect of exogenous FGF19 on prostate cancer
cell proliferation in vitro, we stimulated PC3, LNCaP, and
DU145 prostate cancer cells and PNT1a immortalized normal prostatic epithelial cells with a variety of concentrations
of recombinant FGF19 for 48 or 72 hours in serum-free
medium and determined the extent of cellular proliferation
relative to cells not treated with FGF19. Exogenous FGF19
stimulation enhanced prostate cancer cell proliferation even
at doses as low as 0.25 ng/mL (DU145 and LNCaP cells),
which is near the mean human physiologic serum FGF19
concentration (27–28; Fig. 2A). FGF19-induced proliferation
was lower, but still statistically signiﬁcant, in PNT1a cells at
10 ng/mL. It is unclear why the PNT1a cells are less sensitive
to FGF19-induced proliferation but it might indicate that
PNT1a express a negative regulator of FGF19-induced proliferation that is decreased or lost in prostate cancer cell
lines.

FGF19 stimulates prostate cancer cell invasion
To evaluate the effect of FGF19 on prostate cancer cell
invasion, we conducted invasion assays using Matrigel invasion chambers. After incubation with or without 25 ng/mL of
FGF19 for 24 hours (PC3), 36 hours (DU145), or 72 hours
(LNCaP and PNT1a), cell invasion was analyzed as described
previously (23). FGF19 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion
by approximately 140% to 170% for all cell lines (Fig. 2D).
FGF19 stimulation activates MAP kinase and AKT
pathways in prostate cancer cells
To examine the activation of FGFR signaling and its downstream pathways by FGF19, we analyzed phosphorylation of
FRS2, p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2), and p38 MAPK, as well as
MEK1/2, by Western blot analysis in DU145 cells after stimulation with FGF19 for 15 minutes. As shown in Fig. 3A, FGF19
actives ERK and p38 MAPK signaling. We then examined the

FGF19 in Prostate Cancer

activation of the AKT pathway in LNCaP cells, which have
inactivation of PTEN, by FGF19. Stimulation of LNCaP cells
with FGF19 enhanced AKT activation as evidenced by
increased phosphorylation on both S473 and T308 of AKT
after 24 or 42 hours (Fig. 3B). The activation of AKT was
relatively slow and thus may be an indirect effect of FGF19
stimulation.
FGF19 suppression with shRNA inhibits prostate cancer
cell invasion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo
To determine the biologic importance of the autocrine
FGF19 produced by the prostate cancer cell lines, we carried
out knockdown experiments targeting FGF19. We screened 2
FGF19 GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir clones (Open Biosystem) for

FGF19 knockdown by transient transfection into DU145 and
PC3 cells. FGF19 mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR
48 hours after transfection. Parallel sets of cells were subjected
to invasion and proliferation assays. FGF19mRNA expression
in DU145 cells was suppressed by 40% to 45% and DU145
invasiveness was inhibited by about 25% to 30% (Fig. 4A). PC3
FGF19 mRNA was decreased by 25% to 50% and invasion was
decreased by 45% to 60% (Fig. 4B). The effects on viable cell
number were less striking (<10% decrease), although still
statistically signiﬁcant. Of note, there was an associated
decrease in cell viability from approximately 96% to 85%–
89% for both cell lines using either shRNA (Supplementary Fig.
S1). We did not see a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in Ki67labeled cells (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in viable cell

Figure 3. FGF19 activates MAP kinase and AKT pathways in prostate
cancer cells. A, DU145 cells were serum starved for 24 hours and
stimulated with the indicated concentration of FGF19 or FGF2 for 15
minutes. Cell lysates were prepared and Western blot analysis was
conducted as described in Materials and Methods to assess activation
of MAP kinase signaling. B, LNCaP cells were serum starved for 24 hours
and then treated with the indicated concentration of FGF19 or FGF2 for
either 24 or 42 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and Western blot
analysis was conducted as described in Materials and Methods to
assess the activation of AKT.

number was in large part due to a small, but signiﬁcant,
decrease in cell viability.
We then established stable cell lines in PC3 cells using the 2
shRNAs and analyzed the cell lines for FGF19 protein expression, proliferation, and invasion (Fig. 4C). FGF19 protein, as
determined by ELISA, was decreased by approximately 50% for
both shRNAs cell lines. Invasion was decreased 60% to 77%,
whereas proliferation was decreased by 29% to 37%. Soft agar
colony formation was decreased 40% to 43% (data not shown).
Thus knockdown of autocrine FGF19 has signiﬁcant effects on
multiple cellular phenotypes related to transformation. Most
striking is the impact on invasion, and our ﬁndings indicate
that a signiﬁcant fraction of cancer invasion in these 2 cell lines
can be attributed to autocrine FGF19 expression.
We then carried out a subcutaneous xenograft experiment
with one of the stable shFGF19 PC3 cells lines and vector
controls. FGF19 knockdown resulted in a marked inhibition of
tumor growth with minimal growth of tumor between days 13
and 32 after inoculation (Fig. 4D). Final tumor weight was 325
 6 mg (n ¼ 14) in controls versus 73  1 mg (n ¼ 18) in
FGF19sh1 cells (mean  SEM, P ¼ 2.5  105, t test). These
studies conﬁrm the important role of autocrine FGF19 in
prostate cancer growth in vivo.

FGF19 mRNA was upregulated 3.8-fold in the cancer tissues (P
¼ 0.025, t test). To conﬁrm that FGF19 is expressed in prostate
and/or prostate cancer tissues at the protein level, we carried
out IHC with an anti-FGF19 antibody using a small tissue
microarray containing 29 benign and 15 cancer tissues. Staining was graded as 0 to 3þ (negative, weak, moderate, and
strong) in benign and neoplastic epithelium and stroma.
Approximately 60% of cancer samples showed moderate staining in cancer cells. Stromal staining was also observed, predominantly in spindle-shaped cells, probably ﬁbroblastic or
myoﬁbroblastic cells. An example of staining in a primary
prostate cancer is shown in Fig. 5B. The mean staining in
cancer epithelium was signiﬁcantly higher in cancer than in
benign epithelium (1.47  0.13 versus 1.13  0.07 mean  SEM;
P ¼ 0.02, Mann–Whitney). We have also stained a small tissue
microarray containing 17 metastatic prostate cancers. Interestingly, we found a highly dichotomous staining pattern. Eight
of 17 metastatic cancers stained for FGF19 expression and 7 of
8 had strong staining and 1 moderate staining. Examples of this
strong staining are shown in Fig. 5B. The other 9 cases were
negative (Fig. 5B, bottom right). Thus about half of metastatic
prostate cancer lesions express FGF19, almost all of which
showed strong expression. Negative control with no primary
antibody was completely negative in all cases. Overall, approximately half of all primary and metastatic prostate cancer
express FGF19 protein.
Expression of Klotho coreceptors in human prostate and
prostate cancer
We then examined laser-captured benign and cancer epithelium and stroma for expression of KL mRNA. All 3 normal
epithelia and all 14 normal stroma tissues expressed KL.
Somewhat surprisingly only 2 of 7 cancer epithelia expressed
KL, whereas all 7 cancer stroma samples expressed KL. The RTPCR for epithelial samples is shown in Fig. 6A. Examination
of the Oncomine data bases reveals that KL is signiﬁcantly higher in prostate cancer (as well as in renal cell carcinoma) compared with other cancers (t test P ¼ 4  1045;
top Fig. 6B). Of note, KL is also signiﬁcantly higher in normal
prostate (P ¼ 2  109, bottom Fig. 6B) and kidney compared
with other normal tissues.
Analysis of KLB expression using the laser-captured samples
described above showed no expression in normal epithelium,
whereas expression was seen in 4 of 14 normal stromal
samples. Two of 7 cancer epithelial samples and 4 of 7 cancer
stroma samples expressed KLB. The data from the epithelial
samples is shown in Fig. 6A. Of note, one cancer sample
expressed both KL and KLB and overall 3 of 7 cancer epithelia
express one or both Klotho coreceptors. Examination of the
Oncomine database shows that KLB is signiﬁcantly upregulated in prostate cancer versus normal prostate in multiple
microarray datasets, including the Luo, Varambally, Varanaja,
and Lapointe datasets (Fig. 6C, P < 0.05 for each dataset).

FGF19 in Prostate Cancer

cells (100%). The mean  SD is shown. D, PC3 cells with knockdown of FGF19 (FGF19 sh1, n ¼ 18) or vector controls (n ¼ 14) were inoculated
subcutaneously on day 1. Calculated tumor volume is shown at intervals from day 13 to day 32. Mean  SEM is shown. Statistically signiﬁcant differences from
controls are indicated by asterisks for all experiments.

Immunohistochemical staining with anti-KL antibody
showed variable expression of KL in normal and cancer
epithelium. As shown in Fig. 7A, there is robust expression of
KL in the tubules of the kidney, which is a well-known site of KL
expression by IHC, and negative control showed no staining
(not shown). Examination of a small tissue microarray of
primary prostate cancer tissues revealed a dichotomous staining pattern. In 11 of 22 cases, there was strong staining
of prostate cancer cells (Figs. 7B and C), whereas in 10 cases
there was no staining or focal weak staining (not shown). One
case had moderate staining. Negative control slides showed
no staining. Normal epithelium showed weak staining in 8
of 16 cases with moderate staining in 6 of 16 cases (Fig. 7D) and
no staining in 2 cases. Staining was variable both within
luminal and basal cells. Variable stromal staining was also
seen in both cancer and normal stroma in spindle-shaped cells

www.aacrjournals.org

and in endothelium. Thus KL protein is expressed in about
one half of primary prostate cancer epithelium. Using a small
tissue microarray of metastatic prostate cancer, we found
that 16 of 20 cases had strong staining for KL and 2 had
moderate staining, Thus 90% of metastatic prostate cancer
lesions express KL at moderate or high levels, consistent with
the ﬁnding that all prostate cancer cell lines (all derived from
metastatic lesions) express KL.

Discussion
We have established for the ﬁrst time that FGF19 plays a
role in human prostate cancer. FGF19 is expressed in an
autocrine manner at increased levels compared with benign
prostatic epithelial cells in 3 of 4 prostate cancer cell lines and
by immunohistochemistry in approximately half primary and
metastatic prostate cancers. Suppression of FGF19 expression

by transient or stable transfection of FGF19 targeting shRNAs
signiﬁcantly inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion, colony
formation, and proliferation in vitro and markedly inhibits
tumor growth in vivo. Thus FGF19 can act as an autocrine
factor to promote prostate cancer progression. Additional
orthotopic studies in LNCaP cells (which do not express
FGF19) with inducible expression of FGF19 would help clarify
if FGF19 expression is sufﬁcient to induce increased growth
and/or metastasis in early- and/or later-stage tumors. Our IHC
studies show that FGF19 is expressed in the stroma of a subset
of primary prostate cancers, as seen in our prior laser capture
microdissected prostate cancer stroma expression microarray

data (22), and consistent with a paracrine mechanism of action
in some cases. Our data also suggests that FGF19 can act as an
endocrine factor to promote prostate cancer initiation and
progression. The normal fasting FGF19 serum concentration is
0.19 ng/mL (range 0.05–0.59 ng/mL) and this doubles after
meals in response to absorption of bile acids by the intestine, so
average concentrations are in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 ng/mL
throughout the course of the day. We see statistically significant effects on prostate cancer proliferation and adhesion
in vitro at these levels of FGF19. The constant presence of
FGF19 over decades may thus promote prostate cancer initiation and/or progression in an endocrine manner in vivo. Thus

FGF19 in Prostate Cancer

FGF19 can act as an autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine growth
factor in prostate cancer. Additional studies will be needed
to clarify the relative importance of these modes of action but
it is likely to be variable between different tumors depending
on the levels of autocrine and/or paracrine FGF19 expression.
To respond to low concentrations of FGF19, a Klotho
coreceptor must be present in the cell as well as FGFR(s). The
FGF19 coreceptor KL is expressed in most benign prostate
epithelial tissue samples. In addition, it is expressed in immortalized normal prostatic epithelial cells. Interestingly, analysis
of expression microarray data from Oncomine indicates that
normal kidney and prostate have high levels of KL compared
with other tissues. In kidney, KL is known to be expressed as
the FGF23 coreceptor and plays a key role in phosphate and
vitamin D metabolism (7). This data implies that KL may be
playing a role in the biology of normal prostate epithelium. It is
of interest that the PNT1a normal epithelial cell line is not as
sensitive to FGF19-induced proliferation as the prostate cancer
cell lines, implying that FGF19 may not be supporting normal

www.aacrjournals.org

epithelial growth. Furthermore, this suggests that additional
genetic or epigenetic changes have occurred in prostate cancer
cell lines that enhance the proliferative response to FGF19. KL
is expressed in all the prostate cancer cell lines and in 2 of 7
laser-captured primary prostate cancer cell samples and in half
of prostate cancers by IHC. It is unclear why the KL gene
expression is present in only a subset of primary prostate
cancer samples despite its expression in most benign samples.
However, KL is expressed in 90% of metastatic lesions by IHC,
suggesting that cells expressing KL may be more aggressive. It
should be noted that both FGFR1 and FGFR4 are widely
expressed in prostate cancer. In addition, KL is also present
in cancer and benign stroma, including spindle-shaped cells
and endothelial cells. It has been previously reported that
HUVEC cells express KL (30). Renal cell cancers as well as
prostate cancer both express signiﬁcantly higher levels of KL
than other cancers, suggesting that expression of KL is not
universal in cancers and may reﬂect differences in the underlying biology of these tumors compared with other cancers.

Previous reports indicate that KL can bind FGF19 and can
activate ERK signaling in HEK293 cells transfected with KL and
treated with FGF19 (10). Our ﬁnding that FGF19 can stimulate
biologic activities in LNCaP cells, which express KL but not
KLB, at concentrations as low as 0.25 ng/mL conﬁrms that KL
can act as a coreceptor for FGF19 in this cellular context as
well. For comparison, in the absence of Klotho coreceptors
1,000 ng/mL of FGF19 is required to activate FGFR-4 (31). Thus,
prostate cancer cells often express KL and thus can respond to
FGF19 and potentially to FGF23, which also uses KL as a
coreceptor.
Our data indicate that a subset of primary prostate cancers
express KLB, which is not present in benign prostatic epithelium. This is consistent with our ﬁnding that 2 of 4 prostate
cancer cell lines, but not a normal epithelial cell line, expresses
KLB. Presumably, this expression reﬂects a selective process
allowing for increased response to FGF19, and potentially to
other endocrine FGFs, but further studies are needed to clarify
this point. KLB is also variably expressed in cancer and normal
stroma. The type of cells expressing KLB in stroma and the
reason for the observed variability is unclear. Analysis of
multiple Oncomine databases reveals that overall prostate
cancer expresses higher levels of KLB than normal prostate.
This probably reﬂects increased expression in malignant epithelium but it could also reﬂect increased stromal expression.
Further studies are needed to clarify this point. Interestingly,
we noted both in primary prostate cancer cells and cell lines
that KL and KLB can be coexpressed, indicating that their
functions are probably nonredundant in prostate cancer.
To activate signaling endocrine, FGFs require Klotho coreceptors. FGF23 requires KL (3), FGF21 requires KLB (3), and
FGF19 can use either KL or KLB as described above. The

2560

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

presence of at least one Klotho coreceptor in all prostate
cancer cell lines indicates that other endocrine FGFs in serum
in addition to FGF19 are potential growth factors for prostate
cancer. Endocrine FGFs are present at serum in healthy adults
[approximate means: FGF19: 300 ng/L (28); FGF21: 200 ng/L
(32); and FGF23: 30 ng/L (33)]. While these levels are relatively
low compared with levels of classical FGFs used in tissue
culture, given that endocrine FGFs have actions as hormones
in serum, it is highly likely that they are capable of activating
signaling in cells expressing the relevant coreceptors when
present at these levels. Furthermore, endocrine FGFs are
elevated in disease states, some of which have been linked to
prostate cancer risk and/or aggressiveness. For example, mean
serum levels of FGF23 in patients with renal failure are elevated
20- to 30-fold (33) and there are also more modest increases in
FGF19 (34). Patients with less severe renal dysfunction also
have elevated FGF23 (35). Of note, higher serum calcium, which
is associated with higher FGF23 (33) is signiﬁcantly associated
with the incidence of fatal prostate cancer (36–37). Similarly,
FGF21 has been shown to be increased in obesity (38), which is
linked to fatal prostate cancer (39). Finally, FGF23 can potentially act as a paracrine factor in bone, the primary metastatic
site for prostate cancer, since it is produced predominantly in
osteoblasts and osteocytes (40). Further studies are needed to
determine the role of FGF19 and other endocrine FGFs in
prostate cancer progression and initiation.
Aberrant FGF signaling can promote tumor development by
directly driving cancer cell proliferation, invasion and survival,
and by supporting tumor angiogenesis (15, 41). These observations make FGF signaling networks increasingly attractive as
targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Although targeting FGF signaling as a cancer therapeutic strategy has lagged

FGF19 in Prostate Cancer

behind that of other receptor tyrosine kinases, there is now
substantial evidence for the importance of FGF signaling in the
pathogenesis of diverse tumor types, and clinical reagents that
speciﬁcally target the FGFs and FGFRs are being developed
(41). We have recently shown that inhibition of FGFR kinase
activity using a small molecule inhibitor markedly decreases
prostate cancer tumor progression in vivo (42). The ﬁnding that
FGF19 and perhaps other endocrine FGFs can promote biologic activities in prostate cancer relevant to tumor progression gives further impetus to these efforts in prostate cancer,
particularly anti-FGF19-targeted therapies.
