ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
by the development of multiple tumors in the central nervous system, most notably
schwannomas and meningiomas. Mutational inactivation of NF2 is found in 40–60%
of sporadic meningiomas, but the molecular mechanisms underlying malignant
changes of meningioma cells remain unclear. Because group I p21-activated kinases
(Paks) bind to and are inhibited by the NF2-encoded protein Merlin, we assessed the
signaling and anti-tumor effects of three group-I specific Pak inhibitors - Frax597,
716 and 1036 - in NF2−/− meningiomas in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model.
We found that these Pak inhibitors suppressed the proliferation and motility of both
benign (Ben-Men1) and malignant (KT21-MG1) meningiomas cells. In addition, we
found a strong reduction in phosphorylation of Mek and S6, and decreased cyclin D1
expression in both cell lines after treatment with Pak inhibitors. Using intracranial
xenografts of luciferase-expressing KT21-MG1 cells, we found that treated mice
showed significant tumor suppression for all three Pak inhibitors. Similar effects
were observed in Ben-Men1 cells. Tumors dissected from treated animals exhibited
an increase in apoptosis without notable change in proliferation. Collectively, these
results suggest that Pak inhibitors might be useful agents in treating NF2-deficient
meningiomas.

benign (grade I) and atypical (grade II), respectively.
Although only 5% of meningiomas are categorized
as anaplastic (grade III), some patients with grade I
tumors progress to higher histological grade when
they recur [2]. The oncogenic mechanisms involved in
the transformation of meningioma cells remain to be
elucidated, limiting the opportunity to develop targeted
therapies.

INTRODUCTION
Meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells
located in the arachnoid mater and represent the
most common intracranial neoplasia, accounting for
approximately 30% of central nervous system (CNS)
tumors [1]. According to the World Health Organization
classification, approximately 75% and 20% of cases are

Meningiomas have been reported to occur in ~50%
of neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) patients and are
frequently multifocal, originating either in cranial or
spinal locations [3]. Tumors associated with NF2 often
display more aggressive histologic features than sporadic
meningiomas [4, 5]. However, the frequency of NF2
mutations is similar in all pathological tumor stages,
suggesting that NF2 is important for tumor initiation but
not critical for malignant progression. As such, it has
been inferred that other factors, such as additional genetic
alterations may be responsible for progression within this
population.
Aberrations in signaling pathways have been
identified in meningiomas and implicated in its
tumorigenesis [6, 7]. For example, deregulation of PI3K/
Akt signaling has been found to correlate with aggressive
behavior of malignant tumors, whereas the Erk pathway is
thought to be involved in both proliferation and apoptosis
[8]. Molecular studies indicate that p21-activated kinases
(Paks), in particular Pak1, are required for the activation
of both these pathways in many cell types [9–11]. Paks
are serine/threonine protein kinases that act as downstream
effectors for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac in a
variety of cellular processes [12–14]. Pak is known to
restrain the tumor suppressor function of Merlin, the
protein encoded by the NF2 gene, via phosphorylation
at serine 518 [15, 16]. Reciprocally, Merlin inhibits the
interaction between Pak and Rac and plays an inhibitory
role in Rac-dependent signaling, and loss of Merlin
results in increased Pak activity. These data suggest that
there is a mutual negative regulatory loop between Pak
and Merlin  [17, 18] and that inhibiting Pak might be
beneficial in the setting of NF2, as has been demonstrated
in NF2-related schwannomas [19–21]. The role of Paks
in NF2-related meningioma, however, has not previously
been examined.
Here, we show that Pak1 expression is positively
correlated with the degree of malignancy in primary
meningiomas. Reduction of group I Pak activity by genetic
or pharmacological means was associated with a partial
G1 cell cycle arrest, decreased motility, and deceleration
of meningioma growth in NF2-deficient meningioma cell
lines. In an orthotopic transplant model, we found that
Pak inhibitors were effective in reducing tumor growth
of both benign and malignant meningioma in vivo. These
data suggest that Pak1 represents a reasonable therapeutic
target in NF2-related meningioma.

that Pak1 and Pak3 are most highly expressed in brain,
whereas Pak2 is ubiquitously expressed. However,
little data exists regarding the expression of group
I Paks in meningiomas. To understand the contribution
by which Paks isoforms might be involved in the
growth of meningioma cells, we examined a panel of
13 meningioma cells (11 primary and 2 immortalized)
and 3 arachnoid cell lines. We found that Pak1 and
Pak2 were much more abundant than Pak3 in both
meningioma and arachnoidal cells, as determined by
immunoblot (Fig. S1A). In addition, we found a marked
increased in the expression level of Pak1 in meningioma
cells comparing with arachnoid cells (t-test, P = 0.046;
Fig. 1A). In contrast, there was no statistically significant
difference in Pak2 expression between meningioma and
arachnoidal cells, irrespective of tumor pathological
stages (t-test, P = 0.74). These findings imply that Pak1
expression, but not Pak2 expression, is associated with
tumorigenesis in meningiomas.

Pak1 knockdown reduces meningioma growth
To investigate the significance of Pak1 and
Pak2 in meningiomas, we used doxycycline-inducible
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce Pak1 or Pak2
expression, respectively [25]. NF2-null malignant
meningioma KT21-MG1-Luc5D cells (hereafter
referred to as KT21), were stably transduced with either
empty virus or a virus encoding a Pak1 or Pak2 shRNA
construct. Upon addition of doxycycline, shRNAtransduced cells displayed markedly reduction in
transcriptional and expression level by 75% and 60% for
Pak1 and Pak2, respectively (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Pak1 shRNA had no effect on Pak2 expression
or vice versa. Depletion of either Pak1 or Pak2 resulted
in 45% and 29% inhibition of cell viability, respectively,
compared with corresponding cells without doxycycline
induction (Fig. 1B). Pak1 knockdown cells exhibited
a slight increase in G0/G1 phase (65.2% vs. 71.1%;
P = 0.015), and a corresponding decrease in S phase,
whereas Pak2 depletion cells did not affect cell cycle
populations (Fig. 1C). Similar results were observed
in an NF2-deficient benign meningioma cell line, BenMen1-LucB, hereafter referred to as Ben-Men, in which
expression level diminished by 54% and 58% for Pak1
and Pak2, respectively. Depletion of either Pak1 or Pak2
resulted in 39% and 32% suppression on cell viability as
well (Supplementary Fig. S1C, S1D and S1E).
To assess the role of Pak1 and Pak2 in vivo, we
stereotactically injected shRNA-transduced KT21 cells to
the skull base of SCID mice and monitored tumor growth
by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Mice with established
KT21 tumors, ~3 weeks post-transplantation, were fed
either a normal rodent diet or diet-containing doxycycline
for 5 weeks. Immunohistochemical staining of areas of

transplant brain showed a positive staining for Pak1 except
in shPak1-bearing mice fed with doxycycline diets, which
exhibited an almost total absence of Pak1 immunostain
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similar effects on Pak2 were
observed in mice harboring shPak2 cells. These data show
that the doxycycline-regulated shRNA constructs function
well in vivo.
When fed with a normal rodent diet, mice bearing
shPak1 or shPak2-transduced cells showed a 6-fold and
8-fold increase, respectively, in BLI signals (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, tumors in mice fed with doxycycline
diet grew much more slowly (Fig. 1D). Reduction of
Pak1 expression had a greater effect than reduction of
Pak2 expression, with no net increase in BLI signal
over a five-week period, suggesting that, of these

two enzymes, Pak1 has a dominant role in the growth
of meningioma.
Expression of proliferation marker phosphohistone 3 and the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 was
investigated in tumor tissue from the transplanted mice.
Knockdown of either Pak1 or Pak2 induced a combination
of slightly reduced proliferation and slightly increased
apoptosis, with Pak1 knockdown having the greater effect
(Supplementary Fig. S2B, S2C).

Growth inhibition by Pak small-molecule
inhibitors
Since knock down of either Pak1 or Pak2 slowed
cell growth and tumor growth, we asked whether such
1983

inhibitory effects would be observed using Pak­
small-molecule inhibitors. Two distinct classes of Pak
inhibitors – PF3758309, which potently suppresses both
group I and group II Paks [26], and three group I-specific
Pak inhibitors of increasing specificity (Frax-597
[11,  20], -716 and -1036) (Table  1, Supplementary
Table S1, and Supplementary Fig. S3) – were assessed
for the effects on cell survival. The three Frax
compounds display IC50 values towards Pak1 of
10  nM, 2 nM, and 2 nM, respectively, in vitro. All
three compounds display IC50 values towards Pak4
of >  500  nM (data not shown). Ben-Men and KT21
cells were treated with varying concentrations of
these inhibitors and the IC50 values were determined
following 3 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Exposure of meningioma cell lines to these Pak
small molecules inhibited cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner, with benign meningioma cells
(Ben-Men) consistently displaying more sensitivity to
Pak inhibitors than malignant meningioma cells (KT21)
(Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S4). A Mek inhibitor
(PD325901) had no effect on growth of either of these
cells, while an Akt inhibitor (GSK690693) impeded the
growth of both NF2−/− meningioma cell lines, but this
inhibitory effect was only seen when the compound was
used at high doses.
The IC50 values of NF2-null cells indicated that
Pak inhibitors could be applied as therapeutic drugs
for treatment of NF2 disease in preclinical models.
Because only 60% of sporadic meningiomas are
associated with NF2 abnormalities [3, 27], we also asked
whether Pak inhibitors would affect Merlin-expressing
meningioma cells. An arachnoid cell (AC07) and two
NF2+/+ meningioma cell lines MN328 (benign) and
MN525 (malignant) were assessed for sensitivity to Pak
inhibitors. All cells treated with Pak inhibitors showed a
dose-dependent growth inhibition, as observed by light

microscope and cell viability assay. Interestingly, benign
meningioma cells MN328 were less sensitive to group I
selective Pak inhibitors (Frax-597, -716 and -1036), as
compared to MN525 and AC07 cells (Table 1). Notably,
whereas both NF2−/− meningioma cell lines (Ben-Men
and KT21) were highly sensitive to PF3758309, with
IC50 values in the low to mid nM range, NF2-expressing
meningioma cells showed much less sensitivity to this
compound (IC50 3.4 μM and 5.3 μM for MN328 and
MN525 cells, respectively).

Pak inhibitors suppress proliferation and
survival of NF2-null meningioma cells
Since depletion of Pak1 by shRNA induced a
partial G1 cell cycle arrest, we sought to determine
whether the same phenomenon would be obtained in
NF2−/− meningioma cells after treatment with smallmolecule Pak inhibitors. For these experiments we used
two classes of Pak inhibitors: PF3758309, which inhibits
all Pak isoforms [11, 26], and Frax-597, -716, and
-1036, which inhibit group I Paks only (Supplementary
Fig. S3) [11, 20]. In agreement with our shRNA data,
each of the four inhibitors suppressed at least 50% on
proliferation (Fig.  2A) and induced an increase in the
G0/G1 population in KT21 cells (DMSO vs. Frax1036,
t-test P = 0.005; DMSO vs. PF3758309, t-test P = 0.005;
Fig. 2B). A substantial increase in the number of apoptotic
cells was also observed after addition of Pak inhibitors
to KT21 cells (DMSO vs. Frax597, Frax716, Frax1036,
PF3758309, t-test P = 0.003, 0.001, 0.006 and 0.036,
respectively, Fig.  2C). These compounds, with the
exception of the pan-Pak inhibitor PF3758309, also
suppressed proliferation of Ben-Men cells (Fig. 2D) and
induced a significant elevation on G0/G1 population
(DMSO vs. Frax597, Frax716, Frax1036, PF3758309,
t-test P = 0.0004, 0.0007, 0.0003 and 0.0003, respectively,

signaling pathways

Fig. 2E). In the case of PF3758309, there was a general
loss of viability accompanied by an increase in sub-G0
cells (Fig. 2E and not shown), consistent with an apoptotic
phenotype (DMSO vs. Frax597, Frax716, Frax1036,
PF3758309, t-test P = 0.0009, 0.0657, 0.028 and 0.022,
respectively, Fig. 2F).

To better assess the mechanism by which Pak
inhibitors affect the proliferation and survival of
KT21 and Ben-Men cells, we examined the activation
state of several Pak-dependent signaling pathways.
Pak1 has been implicated in regulating Erk signaling
via phosphorylation of Raf1 and Mek1 [28–30]. As
expected, phosphorylation of Pak and Mek1 (at Ser298,
the putative Pak phosphorylation site) was dramatically
inhibited by Frax597, Frax716 and PF3758309, and
nearly abolished by Frax1036 (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
despite the loss of group I Pak autophosphorylation and
Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation, none of the compounds
except PF3758309 (the least specific inhibitor), caused a
decrease in Erk activity. These data suggest that, unlike
many other cell types, group I Pak activity is not required

Effects of Pak inhibitors on invasiveness
We next asked if small molecule Pak inhibitors
would affect the invasiveness of NF2−/− meningioma
cells. Ben-Men and KT21 cells were plated in a
transwell device, then treated with vehicle or the
indicated compounds, and assessed for motility through
the membrane. These assays showed that all the Pak
inhibitors repressed the invasiveness of benign and
malignant NF2-null meningioma cells by 70% and ~40%,
respectively (Fig. 3).

for Erk activation in these meningioma cell lines. It is
also notable that cells treated with the non-competitive
Pak inhibitor IPA3 displayed a paradoxical stimulation
of Pak activity, as well as all other signaling molecules
measured, rather than inhibition. Such paradoxical
effects have been noted by us previously in certain cell
types, and may reflect general cellular redox effects of

IPA3 [31]. We also made the unexpected observation that
in KT21 cells, all of the small molecule Pak inhibitors
were associated with decreased expression of the group II
Pak, Pak4 (Fig. 4).
Pak1 is thought to affect Akt activation, either
via a scaffolding interaction with PDK1 or by direct
phosphorylation [9, 32]. Treatment with Pak inhibitors

had only a minimal effect on Akt activity in KT21
cells, but a larger effect in Ben-Men cells (Fig. 4). As
predicted, down-regulation on ribosomal S6 was noted in
both cells following Frax compound addition, indicating
decreased mTOR signaling. Interestingly, treatment with
PF3758309 did not influence the activity of Akt in either
cell type, unlike our previous findings in skin epithelial
cells [11].
Cyclin D1 expression, which is important for
G1/S progression, was diminished in meningioma
cells as a consequence of Pak inhibitor administration
(Fig. 4). Strikingly, decreased total and phospho-protein
levels of β-catenin were found in KT21 cells after Frax
compounds addition. This phenomenon was not found
in cells treated with PF3758309, in which only reduction
on phosphorylation status was noted. On the other

hand, induction on basal level of β-catenin was seen in
Ben-Men cells treated with Frax1036, IPA3 and
PF3758309. Although Frax597 and Frax716 did not
impact expression of β-catenin, phosphorylation of this
protein was diminished (Fig. 4). Taken together, these
data suggest that inhibition of KT21 cell cycle progression
by Pak small molecule inhibitors is mediated, at least in
part, by diminished β-catenin signaling with subsequent
reduction in cyclin D1 expression.

[26,  33]. However, this compound inhibits all six Pak
isoforms, and thus may have increased toxicities. As
Frax597 and its derivatives are orally availability and
are specific for group I Paks, we evaluated the effects of
these compounds on tumor growth in vivo. Luciferaseexpressing Ben-Men and KT21 cells, respectively, were
implanted into the base of the skull of SCID mice. After
tumor establishment, the mice were divided into 4 groups
and treated daily with either vehicle or Frax compounds
(597, 716 and 1036) for 2–3 weeks and monitored for
tumor growth by BLI.
Untreated mice bearing KT21 transplants displayed
ventricular invasion (Fig. S5), whereas Ben-Men grew
at the injection site only (not shown), consistent with a
previous report [34]. Treatment with Frax597 impaired
KT21 tumor growth by 50% compared to vehicle
cohort (Fig. 5A). Larger effects were noted in Frax716treated mice, with reduction on bioluminescence of 60%
(P = 0.028). However, these animals also showed >10%
loss of body weight compared with control littermates

(Fig. S6A), an effect not seen in mice treated with
Frax597 or Frax1036. Treatment with Frax1036 also
resulted in slower tumor growth, with reduction in BMI
signals of 37% (P = 0.042; Fig. 5A). It should be noted
that, when tested in MDCK cells, FRAX1036 has low
permeability and is subjected to extensive efflux, and
is hence unlikely to have significant blood brain barrier
permeability in  mice  (apparent permeability (Papp),
apical to basolateral = 1 × 10-6 cm/s; basolateral to
apical = 22.2 × 10-6 cm/s; Papp ratio = 22.6).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that there is a positive
correlation between expression of Pak1 and meningioma
tumor grade, and that inhibiting group I Paks, either by
knockdown or by small molecule inhibitors, impairs
proliferative and survival signaling, and slows the growth
of benign and malignant NF2-null meningioma cells, both

in vitro and in vivo. These results extend earlier work on
the role of Pak signaling in Merlin function in the setting
of Schwannomas, showing that these kinases also play a
role in meningioma and might therefore represent new
therapeutic targets in this disease.
Both Pak1 and Pak2 have previously been
individually linked to Merlin function [15, 16, 18, 21, 35].
Our knockdown studies suggest that both group I Pak
isoforms play a role in signaling downstream of Merlin
(Fig. 1D). These results are in agreement with those of Yi
et al., who showed that both Pak1 and Pak2 contributed
to the transformed behavior of fibroblasts expressing a
dominant negative form of Merlin [21]. Whether these
two kinases act on a common set of substrates or have
independent functions is not yet known.
Constitutively activation of Erk and PI3K/Akt
pathways has been detected in meningiomas [8, 36, 37].
We analyzed the effects of inhibitors of Pak (Frax597,
-716, -1036 and PF3758309), Mek (PD0325901) and Akt
(GSK690693) on cell viability in benign and in malignant
meningiomas. Compared to the Mek or Akt inhibitor, we
found that Pak inhibitors were much more effective in
reducing cell proliferation in vitro, regardless of degree
of malignancy and Merlin expression (Table 1). However,
loss of Pak activity did not reduce Erk phosphorylation
(Fig. 4). These data are consistent with our previous
studies, in which a Pak-specific peptide inhibitor was used
to block Pak activation in Schwann cells that expressed a
dominant negative form of Merlin. In these experiments,
Erk remained active despite loss of Pak activity and loss of
proliferative potential [19]. Thus, while Paks are required
for Erk activation in many cell types, this does not appear
to be the case in the setting of NF2-deficient schwannomas
or meningiomas. Moreover, these data, plus the lack of
effect of Mek inhibitors, suggest that Erk activation is not
germane to transformation of NF2-deficient Schwann cells
or meningeal cells.
Previously, we reported that treatment of a K-rasdriven skin cancer mouse model with either the panPak inhibitor PF3758309 or the group I-specific Pak
inhibitor Frax597 induced near complete suppression of
Pak activity in tumor tissues and had a strong repressive
effect on tumor initiation and progression [11]. In the
present study, we also evaluated two new group I Pak
small-molecule inhibitors, Frax716 and 1036, which
represent more Pak-specific derivatives of the parent
molecule, Frax597 (Fig. S3). All three group I Pak
inhibitors decreased cell proliferation, survival, and
motility (Figs. 2 and 3). These compounds were also
effective in the setting of orthotopic xenografts (Fig. 5).
As Frax1036 has few off-targets (Supplementary Fig. S3),
these data, in combination with the shRNA data shown
in Fig. 1, suggest that blockade of group I Pak function
alone is sufficient to suppress the growth of NF2-deficient
benign or malignant meningioma [9, 32]. The relatively

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lesser effects of such inhibitors in slowing the growth of
malignant, as compared to benign, meningioma cells may
be related to the maintenance of Akt activity in such cells
(Fig. 4).
Treatment of NF2-expressing meningioma cells
with Mek or Akt inhibitors did not inhibit tumor cell
proliferation in vitro (IC50 > 20 μM). These data suggest
that Merlin status may influence the response to these
inhibitors. Apart from mutations or deletions of NF2,
other genetic alternations are also likely to contribute
to responses to targeted agents. Recently, Clark et al.
reported a genomic analysis of 300 non-NF2 meningiomas
and identified oncogenic mutations in SMO, AKT1, KLF4
and TRAF7 [38]. Although mutations in these genes were
not analyzed in this study, understanding the mutational
spectra in meningioma will undoubtedly be useful
in guiding selection of agents for targeted therapies,
including those directed against Paks [39, 40].
While surgery remains the primary treatment for
meningioma patients, development of effective medical
therapies for these tumors, in particular those associated
with NF2 loss, remains an important goal. Recently,
Burns and colleagues have reported that AR42, a histone
deacetylase inhibitor, arrested meningioma cells growth
in G2/M phase and suppressed tumor growth in vivo [34].
This agent, like the direct Pak inhibitors reported here,
also induced cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis.
Interestingly, another histone deacetylase inhibitor,
FK228, has previously been reported to indirectly decrease
Pak1 activity and to inhibit the growth of NF2-deficient
Schwann cells in vitro [41]. Whether this phenomenon
represents a general function of histone deacetylase
inhibitors remains to be determined; if so, there may be
a rationale for the combined use of histone deacetylase
inhibitors and Pak inhibitors in tumors driven by loss
of NF2.

METHODS
Meningioma cell lysates
Lysates from 11 primary meningioma cells of
different WHO grades and 3 arachnoidal cell lines
were kindly provided by Dr. Vijaya Ramesh, Harvard
Medical School (Boston, MA). Protein concentration
was determined, and equal amount of total proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE.

Cell cultures
The
luciferase-expressing
NF2-deficient
benign meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1-LucB, have
been described previously [34], and the luciferaseexpressing NF2-deficient malignant meningioma cell
line, KT21-MG1-Luc5D, were also used (Chang,

1989

Oncotarget

LS., et al., unpublished data). The Merlin-expressing
normal arachnoidal cell line AC07, benign MN328 and
malignant MN525 meningioma cell lines were gifts
from Dr. Vijaya  Ramesh. Cell lines were authenticated
by PCR genotyping to confirm NF2 status. All cell lines
were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.

For detection of apoptosis, subconfluent cells were
plated in 60-mm plate and treated with inhibitors for
3 days. Cells were collected, washed and resuspended in
1x binding buffer with Annexin V-EGFP and propidium
iodide (BioVision, CA) and incubated at room temperature
for 5 min in dark. Apoptosis was measured using FACS
with collecting 10,000 events per sample.

Retroviral transductions

Kinase selectivity was assessed using a
commercial service that employs a fluorescencebased, coupled-enzyme assay based on the differential
sensitivity of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
peptides to proteolytic cleavage (Invitrogen, Z’-LYTE®)
[43]. This assay uses recombinant protein kinases and
assay mixed optimized for each particular kinase (http://
www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/life-science/drugdiscovery/target-and-lead-identification-and-validation
/kinasebiology/kinase-activity-assays/z-lyte.html).

Protein kinase specificity measurements

Inducible shRNA-bearing retrovirus against
Pak1 and Pak2 were previously described [42] and
oligonucleotides used in this study are as follows: Pak1
shRNA-1 5′-GAT CCC CGA AGA GAG GTT CAG CTA
AAT TCA AGA GAT TTA GCT GAA CCT CTC TTC
TTT TTT GGA AA-3′; Pak2 shRNA-5 5′-GAT CCC CTG
ACA GAG GAG GAG GAT GAT TCA AGA GAT CAT
CCT CCT CCT CTG TCA TTT TTT GGA AA-3′.
The ΦNX packaging cell line (Orbigen) was
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral
supernatants were harvested 48 hr post-transfection and
filtered. Meningioma cells were incubated with retroviral
supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene for
4  hr at 37°C, and then were cultured in growth media
for 48 hr for viral integration. Green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-positive infected cells were selected by flow
cytometry (GFP).

Cell invasion assays
Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences) were
rehydrated in serum-free DMEM medium for 2 hr and
then placed in 0.75 ml of DMEM medium supplemented
with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells at a density of 2 × 104
suspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM, and seeded onto Matrigel
chambers. Cells were allowed to migrate for 18 hr. Cells
on the upper surface were gently removed with a cotton
bud, and cells that had migrated through the 8-μm pores
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min. Membranes
were washed, removed and mounted on a glass slide, and
the level of invasion was quantified by visual counting
using a microscope with a 20X objective.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Subconfluent cells were plated in 6-well plates
overnight and treated with doxycycline for 48 hours. Total
RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma). First-Strand
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse
transcriptase according to manufacture’s protocol and
standard PCR was performed subsequently.

Orthotopic meningioma model
KT21-MG1-Luc5D and Ben-Men1-LucB cells were
harvested, washed and resuspended in PBS (0.5 × 106 and
1.0 × 106 cells/mouse in 5 μl). Eight-week-old SCID
mice were anesthetized with ketamine and their heads
were stabilized in a small animal stereotaxic instrument.
A midline sagittal incision was made on the cranial skin.
A burr hole was drilled in the skull with coordinated
1.5 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to the right from the
bregma and a 5-μl Hamilton syringe loaded with cells
was slowly inserted through the burr hole and ~0.5 mm
downward to the skull base. The incision was closed using
surgical absorbable gut suture.

Cell viability assay and flow cytometry
Cells were plated at 3 × 103 cells per well in 96-well
plates overnight and treated with various concentrations of
Pak inhibitors for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by
MTT assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was calculated.
For cell cycle profiles, subconfluent cells were
plated in 60 mm plate and treated with inhibitors for
3 days. Cells were collected, washed and fixed in 70%
ethanol. After fixation, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of
a solution containing 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet
P-40, 10 mM NaCl, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and
70 Kunitz units/ml RNase A. DNA content was analyzed
using CELLQuestTM software (Becton Dickinson).
A minimum of 10,000 events was collected per sample.

Bioluminescence imaging
Mice transplanted with meningioma cells were
imaged using Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (Caliper, MA).

1990

Oncotarget

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with Rediject
D-Luciferin Ultra at 150 mg/kg under anesthetized with
isofluorane. Luciferase activity was measured and all
bioluminescence imaging was conducted when perk signal
was reached. Once tumors were established (~3 weeks
post-transplantation), mice were divided into groups for
shRNA studies or drug treatments.
For shRNA studies, mice were fed either a normal
rodent diet or doxycycline foods for 5 weeks. Tumor
growth was monitored every week by BLI. Photon
emission was quantified using Living Image software
(Caliper, MA) and mean luminescence for each group was
calculated (n = 5 per group).
For drugs treatment, mice were dosed with Pak
inhibitors daily for 14–21 days and tumor growth was
monitored every week by BLI. Mean luminescence for
each treatment groups (n = 5) was calculated as described
previously.

equilibrated in transport buffer (Hank’s Balanced Salt
Solution with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) for 60 minutes at
37°C with 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity prior to
the experiment. Dose solutions were prepared in transport
buffer and consisted of test compounds (10 μM) and the
monolayer integrity marker lucifer yellow (100 μM).
The dose solutions were added to the donor chambers
and transport buffer was added to all receiver chambers.
The transport was examined in the apical to basolateral
(A-B) and basolateral to apical (B-A) directions. The
receiver chambers were sampled (50 μL) at 60, 120,
and 180 min and were replenished with fresh transport
buffer after the 60 and 120 min samplings. Lucifer yellow
permeability was used as a marker of monolayer integrity
for the duration of the experiment and was measured
using a fluorescence plate reader (ex: 425; em: 530 nm).
Compound concentrations in the donor and receiving
compartments were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis.
The apparent permeability (Papp) in the apical to basal
A-B and basal to apical B-A directions, was calculated
as follows: Papp = (dQ/dt) • (1/AC0), where: dQ/dt = rate
of compound appearance in the receiver compartment;
A = Surface area of the insert; and C0 = Initial substrate
concentration at T0. The efflux ratio (ER) was calculated
as (Papp, B-A/Papp, A-B).

Doxycycline administration
Doxycycline-containing food (625 mg/kg; Harlan
Laboratories) was administrated to SCID mice in pelleted
form with complete grain-based rodent diet, and the
control littermates were fed an identical diet, lacking
doxycycline.

Brain tissue preparation, histology,
immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting

Treatment with Pak inhibitors
Frax597 [11, 20] (C29H28ClN7OS; M.W. 558.10)
and Frax716 (C30H30ClN7O2; M.W. 556.06 (Afraxis,
CA) were formulated in 10% (PEG400: Tween-80:
PVP-K30–90:5:5), 15% Vitamin E-TPGS, and 75% of
hydroxypropylcellulose (0.5%) in 50 mM citrate buffer
(pH 3.0) and administered by oral gavage at 90  mg/
kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively. Frax1036
(C28H32ClN7O; M.W. 518.05) (Afraxis, CA) was
formulated in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.0) and administrated by
oral gavage at 30 mg/kg/day. These doses were chosen
to provide minimum plasma concentrations of ≥0.5 μM
at 24 hours. All treatments were begun when tumors
established and were continued for 2 or 3 weeks, at which
time the animals were sacrificed and brain tissues taken
for analysis.

All transplanted brains were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 48 hr, and dehydrated and embedded
in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were
used for diagnostic purposes and unstained sections for
immunohistochemical (IHC) studies. IHC was conducted
with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies
for Pak1 (1:50; 2602), Pak2 (1:100; 2608), cleaved
caspase 3 (1:200; 9664), phospho-histone 3 (1:200; 9701),
cyclin D1 (1:50; 2978) (Cell Signaling Technology). The
evaluation of the IHC was conducted blindly, without
knowledge of the treatments. The percentage of caspase 3,
phospho-histone 3 and cyclin D1 positive cells was
determined by scanning the slides using an Aperio CS
Scanscope scanner and nuclear detection software from
the same manufacturer.
Immunoblot analyses were carried out on lysates
extracted from cells after treatment for 24 hours
(inhibitors with concentration of IC50, as detailed in Fig.
legends) or 72 hours (doxycycline for shRNA). Protein
concentration was determined, and equal amount of
total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies
used included those for Pak1 (2602), Pak2 (2608),
Pak3 (2609), Pak4 (3242), phospho-Pak4-6 (3241),
Mek1 (9122), Erk (9102), phospho-Erk1/2 (pThr202/
pTyr204; 9101), Akt (9272), phospho-Akt (pThr308;
9275), S6 (2217), phospho-S6 (pSer235/pSer236; 4857),­

In vitro permeability assays
Madin-Darby Kidney cells (MDCKI) were obtained
from the National Institutes of Health, (Bethesda, MD).
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 80 ng/mL
colchicine and 5 μg/mL Plasmocin. Cells were harvested
with trypsin and seeded on Millipore Millicell-24 well
plates at initial concentrations of 2.5 × 105 cells/mL
and allowed to grow for 5 days. Cell monolayers were
