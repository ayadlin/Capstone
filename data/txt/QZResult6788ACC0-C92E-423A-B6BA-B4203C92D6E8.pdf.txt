Abstract
Platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D) is a newly recognized growth factor known to regulate many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, transformation, invasion,
and angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown that PDGF-D
and its cognate receptor PDGFR-B are expressed in prostate
tumor tissues, suggesting that PDGF-D might play an
important role in the development and progression of
prostate cancer. However, the biological role of PDGF-D in
tumorigenesis remains elusive. In this study, we found that
PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells (PC3 cells stably transfected
with PDGF-D cDNA and referred to as PC3 PDGF-D) exhibited
a rapid growth rate and enhanced cell invasion that was associated with the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) and reduced Akt activity. Rapamycin repressed mTOR
activity and concomitantly resulted in the activation of Akt,
which could attenuate the therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors. In contrast, B-DIM (BR-DIM from Bioresponse, Inc.;
a chemopreventive agent) significantly inhibited both mTOR
and Akt in PC3 PDGF-D cells, which were correlated with
decreased cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, conditioned medium from PC3 PDGF-D cells significantly increased
the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells,
which was inhibited by B-DIM treatment concomitant with
reduced full-length and active form of PDGF-D. Our results
suggest that B-DIM could serve as a novel and efficient
chemopreventive and/or therapeutic agent by inactivation of
both mTOR and Akt activity in PDGF-D–overexpressing
prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1927–34]

Introduction
Platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D) is a newly recognized
growth factor that can regulate many cellular processes, including
cell proliferation, transformation, invasion, and angiogenesis by
activating its cognate receptor PDGFR-h (1, 2). PDGF-D consists of
the hydrophobic putative NH2-terminal signal peptide, the NH2terminal CUB domain, a hinge region, and the COOH-terminal
growth factor domain containing the cystine knot motif (3). Several
reports have indicated that the CUB domain of PDGF-D have to be
cleaved extracellularly to make the COOH-terminal growth factor

domain active for PDGF-D binding to its receptor (3, 4). It is known
that growth factors, such as PDGF and epidermal growth factor,
can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt through
activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and thereby associate the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.
The mTOR protein kinase has emerged as a critical player for
controlling many cellular processes, such as cell growth and cell
division, by receiving stimulatory signals from Ras and PI3K
downstream from growth factors (5). mTOR regulates translation
rates and cell proliferation in part by phosphorylating two major
targets, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)–
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases
(S6K1 and S6K2). Upon phosphorylation, 4E-BP1 releases from
eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to assemble with other translation initiation
factors to initiate cap-dependent translation. eIF4E is thought to
enhance the translation of transcripts possessing either complex
5¶-untranslated region secondary structure and/or upstream open
reading frames, which often encode proteins associated with a proliferative response. S6K1 directly phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal
protein S6, and then promote ribosome biogenesis (6). Recent
studies have shown that S6K and 4E-BP1 regulated by mTOR are
required for cell motility, (7) and S6K, a downstream target of
the Akt/mTOR pathway, has been shown to inhibit the PI3K/Akt
pathway through a negative feedback mechanism (8–13).
mTOR exists in two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2)
within the cells: mTORC1 consists of mTOR, GhL, raptor, and
PRAS40, and mTORC2 contains mTOR, GhL, rictor, and SIN1. The
raptor-containing complex is sensitive to rapamycin and regulates
cell growth and proliferation in part through phosphorylating
S6K and 4E-BP1. The rictor-containing complex is not sensitive to
rapamycin (14–16). Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, interacts with FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP-12) and subsequently
binds to mTOR at a FKBP-12–rapamycin binding domain, resulting
in inhibiting the interaction of mTOR with its substrate (17). Rapamycin and its analogues strongly inhibit cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis in many tumor cell lines (18, 19), and are known
to increase the survival of patients in limited clinical trials (18).
However, recent studies have shown that the inhibition of mTOR by
rapamycin could lead to the activation of Akt resulting from abrogating feedback inhibition mediated by constitutively activated
mTOR, which is likely to attenuate the therapeutic effects of mTOR
inhibitors (20–23). These results suggested that mTOR is a target
for cancer therapy; however, novel mTOR inhibitors must be
developed that will not only inhibit the mTOR pathway but will not
activate Akt.
3,3¶-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a dimeric product of indole3-carbinol from cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit
cell growth and induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells
(24, 25). We have shown that DIM mediates its biological activity

via inhibiting PI3K activity and Akt activation (25, 26). However,
there is no report showing whether B-DIM–induced inhibition
of invasion and angiogenesis could be mediated through downregulation of the mTOR pathway. In this study, we show that
PDGF-D overexpression leads to an increase in mTOR activity and
inactivation of Akt through a negative feedback mechanism. The
activation of mTOR relays PDGF-D–mediated oncogenic signaling
to its downstream targets, S6K and 4E-BP1, to control cell growth,
invasion, and angiogenesis. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, has
been shown to inactivate mTOR signaling but activate Akt, whereas
B-DIM treatment inhibits cell growth, invasion, and mTOR activation in PC3 PDGF-D cells without activation of Akt. Moreover,
conditioned medium (CM) from PC3 PDGF-D cells treated with
B-DIM reduces the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Therefore, we suggest that B-DIM could
serve as a novel and efficient chemopreventive and/or therapeutic
agent by inhibiting both mTOR and Akt activity, resulting in the
inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis in PDGF-D–overexpressing
prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. Prostate cancer cell line PC3 cells and resultant
transfected cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L glutamine,
10 Amol/L HEPES, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
All cells were cultured in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere at 37jC.
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing PDGF-D. Establishment of PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cell lines were previously described
(27). Briefly, transfection of PC3 cells with pcDNA3-PDGF-D:His or the
corresponding empty vector pcDNA3 Neo selected with Geneticin and
survived cells were pooled together to rule out artifacts and referred to as
PC3 PDGF-D or PC3 Neo.
Reagent and antibody. BR-DIM, hereafter termed as B-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability, was kindly provided by Dr. Michael
Zeligs (BioResponse, Boulder, CO) and was dissolved in DMSO to make
50 mmol/L stock solutions and stored at 20jC in multiple aliquots.
Antibody against human PDGF-D was purchased from Invitrogen. Antibody
against mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K, phospho-p70S6K (Thr389),
4E-BP1, phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/Thr46), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and
raptor were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The monoclonal
antibody to h-actin and PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Antibody against human Bcl-2 was from Dako North
America, Inc. Rapamycin was obtained from EMB Biosciences, Inc.
Small interfering RNA and transfection. PC3 PDGF-D cells were
transfected with mTOR, raptor, or control siRNA (100 nmol/L, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) using DharmaFECT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection reagent (Dharmacon). The medium was removed after 24 hours
of transfection and the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for
24 h. The culture medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cellular
debris, and stored at 70jC for tube formation assay; the cells were then
collected for invasion assay or cell lysates were prepared for Western blot
analysis.
Invasion assay. Cell invasion was determined using BD BioCoat Tumor
Invasion Assay System (BD Bioscience) according to the instruction of the
manufacturer. Briefly, PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells suspended in serumfree medium containing 10 and 25 Amol/L of B-DIM or DMSO and PC3
PDGF-D cells transfected with mTOR, raptor, or control siRNA suspended
in serum-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber of the system.
Bottom wells were filled with complete medium. After a 24-hour incubation,
the cells were stained with 4 Ag/mL Calcein AM in PBS at 37jC for 1 hour.
The fluorescently labeled cells were photographed under a fluorescence
microscope. The fluorescence of the invaded cells was read in ULTRA
Multifunctional Microplate Reader (TECAN) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm.

Matrigel in vitro HUVEC tube formation assay. PC3 Neo and PC3
PDGF-D cells cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% FBS were treated with
B-DIM or DMSO for 48 hours. PC3 PDGF-D cells were transfected with
mTOR, raptor, or control siRNA. CM was collected, centrifuged, transferred
to fresh tubes, and stored at 70jC. HUVEC tube formation assay was
performed as described previously (28).
Western blot assay. PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells were seeded and
incubated for 24 hours in 5% FBS. Cells were washed with PBS and treated
with B-DIM in 5% FBS for 48 h. CM was collected from the culture. Cell
lysates from different experiments were obtained by scraping the cells from
the dishes and washed twice with cold PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in
125 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), sonicated for 10 seconds, and an equal
volume of 4% SDS was added. The lysates were boiled for 10 minutes.
Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce).
Western blot analysis was performed using CM or cell lysates as described
previously (28).
Cell proliferation studies by WST-1 assay. PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D
cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24, 48, 72 hours.
Alternatively, PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 hours; the cells were treated with 10 and 25 Amol/L
B-DIM or 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L rapamycin for 72 hours. Control cells were
treated with DMSO as a vehicle control. After incubation, the cells were
incubated with cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) in
medium for 4 hours at 37jC and 5% CO2. The spectrophotometric
absorbance was determined by using Ultra Multifunctional Microplate
Reader (Tecan) at 450/595 nm.
Data analysis. Experiments presented in the figures are representative of
three or more different repetitions. The data are presented as the mean
values F SE. Comparisons between groups were evaluated by a two-tailed
Student’s t test. P values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Results
PDGF-D significantly increases PC3 cell proliferation. PDGFD is a potent stimulator of cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and transformation. To assess the mitogenic activity of PDGF-D, we examined the growth rates of PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells under
normal growth conditions. PC3 PDGF-D exhibited an increase of
1.6- and 2.4-fold compared with PC3 Neo after 48 and 72 hours of
incubation, respectively (Fig. 1A). Figure 1B shows that PDGF-D
expression and active form of PDGF-D in PC3 PDGF-D cells were
higher than PC3 Neo (negligible or not at detection level). These
results show that exposure of PC3 cells to PDGF-D accelerates cell
proliferation. Because growth factor is known to activate the mTOR
pathway to control cell proliferation and survival, we investigated
the state of mTOR and cell survival factor in PC3 PDGF-D cells.
PDGF-D markedly up-regulates the mTOR pathway, enhances survival factor Bcl-2, and results in inactivation of Akt.
Because PDGF-D significantly increases PC3 cell proliferation, and
growth factors could activate the mTOR pathway via activation
of PI3K/Akt, resulting in stimulation of cell growth and proliferation, we tested whether the mTOR pathway is activated in
PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells. To assess the activity of the
mTOR pathway, we detected phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR)
and its two downstream targets phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4EBP1) and phosphorylated S6K (p-S6K). We found that PDGF-D
markedly increased the levels of p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, and p-S6K.
We also found that Bcl-2, a main prosurvival factor, was significantly enhanced in PC3 PDGF-D cells (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover,
PDGF-D also increased the activity of mTOR signaling in PDGFD–overexpressing LNCaP cells (data not shown). These results
suggest that the mTOR pathway and Bcl-2 could contribute to
prostate cancer cell proliferation induced by prolonged stimulation
via activation of PDGF-D signaling.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is a major upstream
regulator of mTOR. We sought to determine whether Akt activity
was altered in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells. Interestingly, we
found that p-Akt was reduced in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells
in higher passages ( from passages 10 to 30; Fig. 2A and B) but not
in earlier passage (passage 7, data not shown). Because the total
Akt expression was up-regulated in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3
cells, we tested whether the inhibition of Akt activity was due to
the activation/hyperactivaton of the mTOR pathway in PC3 PDGFD cells. For this experiment, we tested the effects of rapamycin, a
mTOR inhibitor, on Akt phosphorylation. Rapamycin at 10 nmol/L
increased phosphorylation of Akt in PC3 Neo and especially in PC3
PDGF-D cells, suggesting that inactivation of Akt is attributed to
a negative feedback regulation mediated by the mTOR pathway

(Fig. 2C). PI3K is an upstream regulator of Akt; thus, we sought
to determine whether the rapamycin-induced activation of Akt
was dependent on PI3K. As shown in Fig. 2C, LY294002, a PI3K
inhibitor, reversed the rapamycin-induced activation of Akt in PC3
Neo and especially in PC3 PDGF-D cells, suggesting that prolonged
exposure of cells to PDGF-D activates the mTOR pathway, which,
in turn, represses Akt activity in PC3 PDGF-D cells through a PI3Kdependent manner. These results suggest that prolonged exposure
to PDGF-D–induced hyperactivation of mTOR is responsible for
inactivation of Akt.
Rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity and induces activation
of Akt, and B-DIM represses the mTOR pathway without
activation of Akt in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, is thought to exert its effect on

and PC3 PDGF-D cells were seeded in 100-mm

mTOR activity by inhibiting the interaction of mTOR with its
substrate. In this study, we have shown that rapamycin inhibited
p-S6K and p-4E-BP1 in PC3 Neo and especially in PC3 PDGF-D
cells. However, rapamycin resulted in activation of Akt in PC3 Neo
and PC3 PDGF-D cells (Fig. 3A and B). Interestingly, rapamycin
treatment down-regulated phosphorylation of mTOR at site Ser2448
in PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells (Fig. 3B). These results support
previous studies showing that mTOR is one of the substrates for
S6K, and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 is mediated by S6K
(29, 30). Thus, rapamycin inhibits S6K1 activity, which, in turn,
reduces the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448. These results
suggest that mTOR is a target for cancer therapy. However, the
activation of Akt mediated by rapamycin treatment is likely to
attenuate the therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors, suggesting
that novel mTOR inhibitors must be developed that will not only
inhibit the mTOR pathway but will also not activate Akt.

DIM has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells
through induction of apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in human
prostate cancer cells (25). We sought to determine whether B-DIM
inhibits the mTOR pathway. In this study, we found that B-DIM
treatment inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K in PC3
PDGF-D cells (Fig. 3C and D). As shown above, rapamycin treatment led to enhanced PI3K/Akt activation via a negative feedback
regulation by the mTOR pathway, suggesting that the activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway by a mTOR inhibitor could in fact make the
tumor more aggressive. Therefore, we sought to examine whether
B-DIM induces activation of Akt. To this end, we tested the effects
of B-DIM on phosphorylation of Akt. B-DIM dramatically reduced
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K in PC3 PDGF-D cells concomitant with inactivation of Akt (Fig. 3C and D). Moreover, B-DIM
also inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 similar to
those observed by rapamycin (Fig. 3D).

Figure 3. B-DIM and rapamycin inhibits
mTOR pathway, and rapamycin but not
B-DIM results in activation of Akt in PC3
PDGF-D cells. PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D
cells were seeded in 100-mm plates in 5%
FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with
10 nmol/L rapamycin for 0.5 to 48 h (A )
or treated with 0, 10, and 100 nmol/L
rapamycin for 8 h (B). Cells were seeded
as above and treated with 10 Amol/L
B-DIM for 0.5 to 48 h (C ) or treated with
0, 10, and 25 Amol/L B-DIM for 16 h (D ).
Cell lysates were prepared and equal
amounts of proteins were subjected to gel
electrophoresis. Western blot analysis
was performed using antibody against
mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K,
phospho-p70S6K (Thr389), 4E-BP1,
phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/Thr46), Akt, and
phospho-Akt (Ser473). h-Actin protein was
used as loading control.

Figure 4. B-DIM is more effective than
rapamycin in inhibiting cell proliferation, and
B-DIM reduces full-length and active forms
of PDGF-D. PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D
cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After
24 h, the cells were treated with 0, 1, 10,
and 100 nmol/L rapamycin (A), or treated
with 0, 10, and 25 Amol/L B-DIM (B) for
72 h. After treatment, the cells were
incubated with cell proliferation reagent
WST-1 in medium for 4 h at 37jC and
5% CO2. The spectrophotometric
absorbance was determined by using
Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader at
450/595 nm. Viable cells were calculated
relative to the PC3 Neo control with
assigned value of 100% (n = 6; #, P < 0.05
and *, P < 0.01 compared with PC3 Neo
or PC3 PDGF-D control). C and D, PC3
Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells that were
seeded in 100-mm plates in 5% FBS. After
24 h, cells were treated with 0, 10, and
25 Amol/L B-DIM for 48 h in 0.5% FBS.
CM was collected and cell lysates were
prepared. CM and equal amounts
of proteins were subjected to gel
electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis
was performed using antibody against
PDGF-D.

B-DIM inhibits cell growth partly via decreasing the fulllength and active forms of PDGF-D. Rapamycin has been shown
to induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit cell proliferation. PDGF-D
overexpression resulted in an increase in cell proliferation of PC3
cells through up-regulation of the mTOR pathway. Therefore, we
speculated that rapamycin could be more effective in inhibiting
cell proliferation of PC3 PDGF-D compared with PC3 Neo cells. We
have determined the growth rate of PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells
in the presence of rapamycin and found that rapamycin
significantly inhibited PC3 PDGF-D cell proliferation (Fig. 4A). On
the other hand, B-DIM not only inhibited mTOR pathway activity
but also repressed Akt activation in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3
cells, which was consistent with the inhibition of cell growth showing that PC3 PDGF-D cells could be more sensitive to B-DIM treatment without activating Akt compared with rapamycin (Fig. 4B).
To determine whether the inhibition of cell proliferation of PC3
PDGF-D cells by B-DIM was partly due to inhibition in the
expression and activation of PDGF-D, we have investigated to find
the full-length and activated forms of PDGF-D in CM and cell
lysates by Western blot analysis. We found that both 10 and
25 Amol/L B-DIM markedly decreased the activated and the fulllength forms of PDGF-D in the CM and in cell lysates (Fig. 4C
and D). These results suggest that B-DIM–induced inhibition in cell
proliferation of PC3 PDGF-D cells is partly mediated by reduced
expression of PDGF-D as well as the activated form of PDGF-D.
B-DIM inhibits invasion of PC3 PDGF-D cells. The mTOR
pathway not only controls cell growth and proliferation but also
regulates cell invasion. Recent studies have shown that expression
of constitutively active form of S6K is sufficient to induce invasion
and migration in ovarian cancer cells (31). In this study, we found
that overexpression of PDGF-D induced activation of mTOR
pathway, resulting in an increase in S6K phosphorylation. Because

www.aacrjournals.org

we found that B-DIM treatment inhibits active PDGF-D and phosphorylation of S6K, we speculated that B-DIM might inhibit cell
invasion of PC3 PDGF-D cells. As expected, PDGF-D–overexpressing
PC3 cells exhibited an increased invasion, whereas B-DIM treatment significantly inhibited invasion of PC3 PDGF-D cells (Fig. 5A
and C).
Reduced tube formation of HUVECs induced by CM from PC3
PDGF-D cells treated with B-DIM. mTOR activation increases
vascular endothelial growth factor expression that mediates
angiogenesis (32), and rapamycin repressed tumor growth by
antiangiogenesis (33). In this study, we found that B-DIM inhibited
mTOR activation in PC3 PDGF-D–transfected cells. Therefore,
we hypothesized that B-DIM might inhibit angiogenesis induced
by mTOR activation. To test this hypothesis, we performed tube
formation assay by incubating HUVECs with CM from PC3 Neo
and PC3 PDGF-D cells treated with B-DIM or DMSO. CM from PC3
PDGF-D cells significantly increased tube formation of HUVECs
compared with PC3 Neo. Importantly, CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells
treated with 10 and 25 Amol/L B-DIM reduced tube formation of
HUVECs (Fig. 5B and D).
Decreased invasion and angiogenesis of PC3 PDGF-D cells
by knocking down of mTOR and raptor. To confirm whether the
mTOR pathway is responsible for increased invasion and
angiogenesis of PC3 PDGF-D cells, we knocked down mTOR and
raptor expression by siRNA with specific oligonucleotides (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Knockdown of mTOR and raptor markedly
repressed the invasion of PC3 PDGF-D cells (Fig. 6A and C, left).
Moreover, CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells with knockdown of mTOR
or raptor reduced tube formation of HUVECs (Fig. 6B and C, right).
Figure 6D showed that transfection of PC3 PDGF-D cells with
mTOR or raptor siRNA led to a significant decrease in mTOR and
raptor expression, respectively, with concomitant reduction in the

levels of p-S6K and p-4E-BP1. These results suggest that mTOR
activation contributes to PC3 PDGF-D cell invasion and angiogenesis as determined by tube formation of HUVECs using CM from
PC3 PDGF-D cells.

Discussion
PDGF-D has been shown to be expressed in many tumor cell lines
(4). Recent studies have shown that PDGF-D is expressed in prostate
tumor tissues (27), suggesting that PDGF-D might play an
important role in the development and progression of prostate
cancer. However, the biological and mechanistic role of PDGF-D in
tumorigenesis remains elusive. To examine whether PDGF-D plays
any role in prostate cancer progression, PC3 cells were stably
transfected with human full-length PDGF-D cDNA. We found that
PC3 cells transfected with PDGF-D (PC3 PDGF-D cells) exhibit a
rapid growth rate and increased invasion in vitro, which were
associated with a high level of mTOR activity and increased Bcl-2
expression, but reduced activity of Akt. Moreover, CM from PDGFD–overexpressing PC3 cells induced tube formation of HUVECs.
However, the mechanism by which PDGF-D induced angiogenesis is
unclear. Recent studies have shown that CM from Bcl-2–transfected
human dermal microvascular endothelial cells is sufficient to induce neovascularization in the rat corneal assay and also found that
the expression of proangiogenic chemokines interleukin-8 (CXCL8)

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

and growth-related oncogene-a (CXCL1) is significantly higher
in Bcl-2–transfected cells than that in control (34). Anai et al. (35)
found that knockdown of Bcl-2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides
inhibited angiogenesis in human PC3 prostate tumor xenografts.
In our study, Bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in PDGFD–overexpressing PC3 cells compared with that in PC3 Neo cells.
Thus, Bcl-2–induced proangiogenic factors could be responsible for
HUVEC tube formation induced by CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells.
We also observed that PDGF-D existed in both full-length and
active forms in the culture medium and cellular lysates of PC3
PDGF-D cells, suggesting that proteases capable of proteolytic
activation of PDGF-D are expressed in PC3 cells. Taken together,
these results suggested that activated PDGF-D could promote cell
proliferation and invasion by activating mTOR pathway. Growth
factor–mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to
control cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis by
phosphorylating mTOR downstream targets S6K and 4E-BP1 (36).
In this study, we found that PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells
exhibited growth advantage by activating mTOR downstream
targets such as S6K and 4E-BP1 with concomitant inactivation of
Akt. These results are consistent with recent studies showing that
constitutively activated mTOR could result in reduced activation of
PI3K/Akt through a negative feedback inhibition (8–13).
Akt is an upstream effector of mTOR pathway and activates
mTOR by phosphorylating tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a

mTOR inhibitor. TSC1 and TSC2 form heterodimers with GTPase
activity that inhibits the active Rheb, a small GTPase required for
mTOR activation (37). A recent study has shown that activation of
Akt mediated by serum or growth factors is inhibited when mTOR
is activated in TSC1- or TSC2-deficient cells via a negative feedback
regulation loop (12). This feedback inhibitory loop has been
attributed to the inhibitory effect of S6K on IRS-1, which mediates
PI3k/Akt activation by insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin
(11, 12, 21, 23). However, little is known whether growth factors,
except for insulin, could activate mTOR pathway that may be
linked to inactivation of Akt through a negative feedback mechanism. In this report, we found that prolonged exposure of PC3 cells
to PDGF-D led to hyperactivation of mTOR and consequently
inactivated Akt. We also found that LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor,

prevented Akt activation induced by rapamycin, suggesting that
PI3K activity is required for the negative feedback inhibition of Akt
mediated by hyperactive mTOR pathway. Taken together, these
results suggest that cancer cells secret PDGF-D, which, in turn,
activate mTOR pathway to promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and induce angiogenesis, and concomitantly desensitize cells
to stimulation by these growth factors through inactivation of
PI3K/Akt pathway. These results further suggest that the growth
of tumors with higher levels of PDGF-D could be inhibited by
inhibiting mTOR and its downstream targets.
Rapamycin, the bacterially derived macrolide ester, is clinically
approved as an immunosuppressant and has been shown to be a
promising antitumor agent. In this study, we found that rapamycin
treatment significantly inhibited PC3 PDGF-D cell proliferation,
whereas less inhibition of proliferation was observed in PC3 Neo
cells. Concomitantly, rapamycin treatment dramatically reduced
phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 but activated Akt during
24 hours of treatment. These results suggest that hyperactivation
of the mTOR pathway was responsible for growth advantage and,
in turn, Akt was inactivated through a negative feedback regulation
in PC3 PDGF-D cells. Interestingly, rapamycin treatment not only
repressed mTOR downstream targets S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but also suppressed mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448.
Recent studies have shown that mTOR is one of the substrates for
S6K, and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 is mediated by S6K
(29, 30). Thus, S6K can regulate mTOR activity by a positive
feedback regulation. It is known that phosphorylation site Ser2448
in mTOR lies within a COOH-terminal regulatory region, which
upon deletion results in elevated mTOR activity in vitro and in
cells. Thus, this COOH-terminal regulatory region is known as a
‘‘repressor domain’’ and, as such, phosphorylation of Ser2448 in
mTOR results in enhanced mTOR activity. In the present study,
rapamycin treatment led to the inactivation of S6K, which, in
turn, resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of mTOR at
Ser2448. These results strongly suggest that rapamycin could serve
as a promising antitumor drug in many tumors with hyperactivated mTOR pathway. However, S6K is not only a positive
regulator for mTOR but is also a negative factor for the PI3K/Akt
pathway. Thus, inhibition of S6K by rapamycin could lead to the
activation of Akt, resulting from abrogating feedback inhibition
mediated by activated mTOR pathway, which is likely to attenuate
the overall therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors, and further
suggest that development of newer and novel agents are urgently
needed.
DIM and B-DIM (a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability)
have been shown to inhibit the cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and growth of tumors in human prostate cancer (24, 25, 28).
In this study, we found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of PC3 PDGF-D cells, which were associated
with a remarkable inhibition of mTOR, S6K, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and reduction of PDGF-D expression and reduced active
form of PDGF-D. Moreover, CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells treated with
B-DIM inhibited angiogenesis (tube formation of HUVECs). More
importantly, inhibition of mTOR pathway by B-DIM in PDGFD–overexpressing PC3 cells did not result in activation of Akt.
Recent studies have shown that prolonged rapamycin treatment
could inhibit mTORC2 assembly and therefore Akt activation
(38, 39). In this study, we found that rapamycin treatment resulted
in the activation of Akt. However, B-DIM not only inhibited mTOR
but also inhibited Akt, which could be due to perturbation of
mTORC2 assembly.

In summary, we found that PDGF-D induced cell proliferation
and invasion of PC3 cells, and that the CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells
significantly increased angiogenesis (tube formation of HUVECs),
which are likely mediated by hyperactivation of mTOR. Rapamycin
inhibited the proliferation of PC3 PDGF-D cells and repressed the
activity of the mTOR pathway but induced activation of Akt. In
contrast, B-DIM strongly suppressed the proliferation and invasion
of PC3 PDGF-D cells and inhibited mTOR activity without activation of Akt in PDGF-D–overexpressing PC3 cells, which was
partly due to reduced levels of the full-length form as well as the
active form of PDGF-D. Moreover, CM from PC3 PDGF-D cells
treated with B-DIM decreased angiogenesis (tube formation of
