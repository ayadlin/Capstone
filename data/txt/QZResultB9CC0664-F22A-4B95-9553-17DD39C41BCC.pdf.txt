estrogen metabolite, 2ME2 is not an estrogen receptor a or h
agonist, and its antiproliferative and apoptotic activities (5–7) are
independent of the interaction with those receptors (8). The
antiangiogenic activity of 2ME2 is, at least in part, mediated
through down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, which
inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1–induced transcriptional activation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression (9). Inhibition
of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 takes place downstream of the 2ME2/
tubulin interaction, as disruption of interphase microtubules is
necessary for hypoxia-inducible factor-1a down-regulation (9).
2ME2 causes cell cycle arrest at G2-M (10–12), and it has been
proposed that cell cycle arrest is mediated by the ability of 2ME2 to
bind to the colchicine binding site of tubulin with impairment of
spindle formation (11, 13); however, this finding has been disputed
(10) and the process by which 2ME2 inhibits tumor growth is still
not well understood.
Here we report further insight into the mechanism of cell cycle
regulation by 2ME2 through inhibition of the anaphase-promoting
complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase of which the activation is
required for separation of sister chromatids, which are the the
target of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. We also describe
the identification of a novel mechanism of 2ME2-induced inhibition of protein translation via a tubulin-independent pathway.

Abstract
2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an estradiol metabolite with
antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities, is in phase I/
II clinical trials for breast cancer. 2ME2 inhibits microtubule
polymerization and causes cells to arrest in G2-M. The purpose
of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of 2ME2. MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells were treated
with 2ME2 (2 Mmol/L) or vehicle alone. RNA was extracted and
genomic profiling was done using 22k Agilent microarrays.
Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer was used to determine enrichment of Gene Ontology categories. Protein isolates
were subjected to Western blot analysis. Protein synthesis was
measured with a [35S]methionine pulse assay. An MDA-MB-435
cell line with two B-tubulin mutations (2ME2R) was used to
determine whether novel mechanisms were tubulin-dependent.
Gene Ontology categories enriched include genes that regulate
the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, apoptosis, and the
cytosolic ribosome. The target of the mitotic spindle assembly
checkpoint is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). APC
inhibition was confirmed by measuring protein levels of its
targets securin and cyclin B1, which were increased in 2ME2treated cells. Because gene expression in the cytosolic ribosome category was decreased, we evaluated whether 2ME2
decreases protein translation. This was confirmed with a pulse
assay, which showed decreased isotope incorporation in 2ME2treated cells, which was maintained in the tubulin-resistant
2ME2R cells. APC inhibition was not maintained in 2ME2R
cells. 2ME2 induces tubulin-dependent cell cycle arrest
through regulation of genes involved in the mitotic spindle
assembly checkpoint, which results in inhibition of the APC
and tubulin-independent inhibition of protein translation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and proliferation assays. MDA-MB-435 human breast
cancer cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) with 100 units of penicillin + streptomycin
(Life Technologies). 2ME2R, a stable 2ME2-resistant MDA-MB-435 human
cancer cell line with two acquired tubulin mutations (14), and the control
parental MDA-MD-435 (P435) were characterized as previously described
(14). 2ME2R and P435 cells were cultured in DMEM with 1% HEPES with
10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1 mmol/L MEM
nonessential amino acids and vitamins, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
2ME2R cells were maintained in 2ME2 (2 Amol/L).
To determine the IC50 value for 2ME2, cell proliferation assays were done
in the following manner: MDA-MB-435, P435, and 2ME2R cells (20,000 per
well) were plated in a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h in the absence
of 2ME2. 2ME2 [Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or EntreMed, Inc. (Rockville, MD)]
was suspended in DMSO and serially diluted in media to make final
concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 200 Amol/L. The final DMSO
concentration was <1% by volume. The drug mixtures or solvent alone
was added to each well 24 h after being seeded. Control wells for 2ME2
contained 1% DMSO by volume. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and
counted using a hemocytometer. The readings obtained for each
concentration tested are from averages of three wells. Each experiment is
expressed as a percentage of control, and the results are averages of at least
three experiments. IC50 values were determined from dose-response curves
using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).

Introduction
2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is orally active and has both
antitumor and antiangiogenic activities in vivo (1, 2) and is
currently in phase I/II clinical trials for cancer (3, 4). Although an

Novel Mechanisms of 2-Methoxyestradiol
Cell culture and RNA extraction. MDA-MB-435 was plated (2.5  106
cells) in 75-cm2 flasks or 100-mm plates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 units of penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). After 24 h,
the medium was changed and cells were cultured with 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) or
1% DMSO by volume. After 48 h, total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen
RNeasy Kit and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,
Germantown, MD). The integrity and relative contamination of mRNA with
rRNA were tested using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Technical replicates were done four times each to give a significant level of confidence for the average experimental-to-control intensity ratio for each gene.
cDNA synthesis and microarray hybridization. RNA from cells was
reverse transcribed into cDNA labeled with Cy5-dUTP (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) and into Cy3-labeled common
reference sample that is a modified version of the Stratagene Human
Universal (15) as previously described (16). Microarray hybridizations were
done using 22k Agilent Human oligonucleotide microarrays. After
hybridization, the arrays were scanned with Axon Gene Pix 4000 scanner
(Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). The images were analyzed using
Gene Pix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments).
Data normalization, preprocessing, and statistics. Gene expression
values were quantified by the log 2 ratio of red channel intensity versus
green channel intensity, followed by LOWESS normalization to remove the
intensity-dependent dye bias and variation (17). UNC Microarray database8
was used for filtering and preprocessing.9 A two-class Significance Analysis
of Microarrays (SAM10; refs. 18, 19) was done to identify significantly
differentially expressed genes between arrays from treated and control cells.
To interpret the gene lists derived from the results of SAM and to convert
the gene list into biological themes, we applied the Expression Analysis
Systematic Explorer (EASE)11 analysis. If genes in a biological category are
significantly enriched in the SAM-derived gene list, then that biological
category may be involved in the biological system. EASE can assign a score
to quantify how much confidence we have about the discovery.
Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was done as
previously described (20). Briefly, cells (2  105) were plated on a 60-mm
plate, harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 mL of
PBS. After spinning, RNase A was added ( final concentration, 2 mg/mL).
Cells were further stained with 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide solution. Cell
cycle analysis was carried out with a Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA)
FACScan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed with the Modfit LT software
(Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME).
Apoptosis. The carboxyfluorescein FLICA apoptosis detection kit
(Immunohistochemistry Technologies, LLC, Bloomington, MN) was used
to measure typical apoptosis, atypical apoptosis, and necrosis (21). Briefly,
2  105 cells were grown overnight on a 60-mm plate and treated with
2ME2 (1 and 5 Amol/L) for 24 or 48 h. Both attached and floating cells were
collected by trypsinization and incubated with carboxyfluorescein-labeled
pan-caspase inhibitor FAM-VAD-fmk for 2 h at 37jC. Labeled cells were
rinsed twice in PBS and resuspended in 300 AL of PBS containing 0.3 Ag of
propidium iodide. Apoptotic cells were identified by FACScan analysis as
previously described (21). All apoptosis assays were done thrice and
representative data are presented.
Cell-surface staining for cyclin B1. Surface staining for cyclin B1 was
done according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( fluorescein-FITCconjugated cyclin B1 antibody reagent set, BD PharMingen, San Diego,
CA). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, adjusted to 106 cells per sample,
and incubated with either FITC-conjugated mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)
as a control or cyclin B1 for 30 min at room temperature. Analysis was done
by using the CellQuest software.
Western blotting. P435 or 2ME2R cells were seeded in T75 culture flasks
in the absence of 2ME2. After 24 h, the medium was then replaced with a

new medium containing either vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 5 Amol/L 2ME2 for
16, 24, or 48 h at 37jC. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by suspending the
cells in lysis buffer (8 mol/L urea, 4% CHAPS, 15 mmol/L Tris-HCl)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Nutley, NJ) and then briefly
sonicated. Proteins (40 Ag/lane) were resolved by 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE and
electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane
was then incubated with the securin primary rabbit antibody (4 Ag/mL;
Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), followed by securin secondary
goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated antibody
(1:10,000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primary mouse antibody (1:5,000;
Chemicon International), and then by GAPDH secondary sheep anti-mouse
HRP-conjugated antibody (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences), and finally
electrochemiluminescence detection was done. Proteins were normalized
on GAPDH expression in the same lane. Relative absorbances (arbitrary
units) were normalized against those of each control group. Results are
expressed as the mean F SE. Statistical analysis was done using a one-tailed
unpaired t test, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Antibodies against cyclin B1 and cdc2 were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-cdc2
(Thr161 and Tyr15) and phospho-Bcl-2 were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA). Phospho-Bcl-2 and total Bcl-2 were from BD PharMingen.
All the primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary
antibodies against rabbit were used at 1:10,000 whereas secondary
antibodies against mouse were used at 1:2,000 (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).
APC ubiquitination assay. Ubiquitination assays were carried out as
described (22). The substrate Clb2 (pRSETClb2), the coactivator Cdh1
(pET28-His6-Cdh1), and the E2 Ubc4 (pET28-His6-Ubc4) were prepared
using the TNT T7 Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation kit
(Promega, Madison, WI). APC (YKA156) was purified from budding yeast
(W303 background) arrested in late M phase and f0.1 pmol was used in
each reaction. For APC purification, cells from the strain YKA156 (MATa
bar1::URA3 cdc15-2 ura3 leu2 trp1 CDC27-3FLAG::KanMX4) were arrested
in late M phase during mid-log phase growth. Late M phase arrest was
achieved by shifting YKA156 cultures (cdc15-2 allele) from 25jC (permissive) to 37jC (restrictive). Cells were lysed in 1 volume of APC-C lysis
buffer [25 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 400 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol,
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] by
vortexing for 45 min at 4jC in 1.7-mL microcentrifuge tubes containing
0.5 mL of 0.5-mm glass beads (23). Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000  g for 15 min. Soluble extracts were pooled and cleared a
second time at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. Extracts were incubated with
EZView anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled resin (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 4jC,
washed extensively with APC-C buffer, and eluted with FLAG peptide
(250 Ag/mL) in low-salt APC-C buffer [25 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmol/L DTT,
z0.5 mmol/L PMSF]. Clb2 was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, CA). Stock solutions (20) of 2ME2 were used and final
concentrations in each reaction were as noted. Reactions were run on a 4%
to 12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), dried, and imaged using Hyperfilm
(Amersham Biosciences).
Protein translation assay. MDA-MB-435 and 2ME2R cells were seeded
in T75 culture flasks. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with new
medium containing either 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) alone and
was then treated for a period of 48 h. Cells were suspended in pulse media
containing DMEM/MG132 (20 Amol/L)/[35S]methionine (250 ACi/100 AL)
with either 2ME2 or vehicle alone. The cell suspensions were incubated in a
water bath at 37jC for periods of 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. Immediately after
briefly vortexing, equal aliquots were then taken at each time point. Isotope
incorporation was then stopped by placing each aliquot in 10 volume of
ice-cold PBS containing 1 mg/mL methionine. Cells were pelleted and
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Cells were then lysed on ice for 30 min, with vortexing every
10 min. The lysates were then spun at 16,000  g for 15 min to pellet
the insoluble fraction. Equal volumes of the soluble fraction were resolved

cycle distribution in parental (P435) and 2ME2-resistant (2ME2R)
cells by treating both cells with either 1 or 5 Amol/L 2ME2 and did
a time course study. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, treatment of P435
with 2ME2 led to an accumulation of cells at the G2-M phase of the
cell cycle as early as 16 h (63.0% and 78.6% at 1 and 5 Amol/L,
respectively). Whereas G2-M arrest was reversible with 1 Amol/L at
24 and 48 h, the cells remained at G2-M longer with 5 Amol/L
treatment. In contrast, no major G2-M arrest was observed in
2ME2R cells even after 48 h of 2ME2 treatment, indicating that
2ME2R cells are insensitive to 2ME2-induced G2-M cell cycle arrest
(Fig. 2A and B). The cell cycle profile for each cell line was also
done at each time point in the absence of drug treatment. The
profile was similar to time 0 (data not shown).
We further evaluated the sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis,
which usually follows G2-M arrest. We did the carboxyfluorescein
FLICA assay to measure the level of active caspases and loss of
plasma membrane integrity and to quantitate live, apoptotic,
atypical apoptotic (apoptosis with loss of plasma membrane
integrity), and necrotic cells (21). P435-sensitive cells exhibited
increased typical and atypical apoptosis in a time-dependent
manner in response to 2ME2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, 2ME2R cells failed
to undergo apoptosis when treated with 2ME2.
Inhibition of the APC. Genes involved in the regulation of the
mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, MAD2 (mitotic arrest deficient),
BUB1(budding uninhibited by benzimidazole), and CDC20, were
differentially expressed by microarray analyses in the 2ME2-treated

Results
Proliferation assays. 2ME2 sensitivity in MDA-MB-435, 2ME2R,
and P435 cells was determined by a 48-hour proliferation assay.
IC50 values for 2ME2 were 1.3 Amol/L for MDA-MB-435, 99.5 Amol/L
for 2ME2R cells, and 4.7 Amol/L for P435. This represents a 21-fold
increase in resistance of 2ME2R cells to 2ME2 compared with P435
cells, which is consistent with the recently published report that
characterized this new resistant cell line (14).
Identification of treatment response genes using cDNA
microarrays. Gene expression was studied in MDA-MB-435
human breast cancer cells with and without the addition of
2ME2 (2 Amol/L) using human 22k Agilent microarrays. Using
SAM, there was differential expression in 264 genes, of which
135 were up-regulated and 129 were down-regulated (Supplementary data). When categorized by function with EASE, there were
changes in expression of genes involved in six Gene Ontology
categories (Fig. 1A). We further investigated three of the Gene
Ontology categories, cell cycle (Fig. 1B, i), apoptosis (Fig. 1B, ii),
and cytosolic ribosome (Fig. 1B, iii), and evaluated whether their
mechanisms were tubulin dependent.
Regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis by 2ME2 is tubulindependent. To determine whether regulation of cell cycle and
apoptosis by 2ME2 is tubulin dependent, we first studied the cell

increased at 16 h in 2ME2-treated 2ME2R cells, but the increase
was attenuated at 24 h and was significantly lower than the
increase seen at 24 h in the P435 cells (Fig. 4B and D).
Next, we evaluated cyclin B1 in cells treated with 2ME2 (5 Amol/L).
P435 cells and 2ME2R cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to
determine the cyclin B1 expression throughout the cell cycle
progression using FITC-labeled cyclin B1 antibody. Cyclin B1
expression at G2-M phase was increased at 16 and 24 h in P435

MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 1B, i). The mitotic assembly checkpoint
is controlled by the APC (24). To confirm the involvement of
the genes that regulate the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint,
we analyzed the expression levels of securin and cyclin B1, the
essential targets of the APC. Using Western blot analysis, we
found statistically significant increases in protein levels of securin
at 16 and 24 h (Fig. 4A and C) in 2ME2-treated P435 cells, providing
evidence that the APC was inhibited. In contrast, securin was

the increase was not obvious with 2ME2R cells. Cyclin B1 is
associated with cdc2 protein. Comparison of phosphorylation
status of cdc2, a G2-M regulatory protein that controls the entrance
to and exit from M-phase, showed that phosphorylation of Thr161
representing the active form was increased in response to 2ME2
treatment at 16, 24, and 48 h (which was not seen in 2ME2R cells),
whereas phosphorylation of Tyr15 (inactive form) was decreased at
the same time points. Furthermore, we observed the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein specifically in P435 cells when treated with
2ME2 at 16 and 24 h, consistent with an earlier report (25). Taken
together, these results provide further support that regulation of
cell cycle and apoptosis by 2ME2 is tubulin dependent.
2ME2 does not directly bind to the APC. To elucidate whether
2ME2 is directly binding to and inhibiting the APC, we evaluated
the effect of 2ME2 on the APC in an APC ubiquitination assay. In
this assay, the APC is isolated from yeast and incubated with
coactivator Cdh1 and substrate Clb2, and, as a result, Clb2 is
ubiquitinated. We found that the addition of 2ME2 did not inhibit
ubiquitination of the substrate Clb2 (Supplementary data), which
shows that 2ME2 does not directly bind to and inhibit the APC.
2ME2 inhibits protein translation. We next evaluated the
effect of 2ME2 on protein translation because gene expression in
the cytosolic ribosome category was decreased in response to
2ME2. We measured protein translation in MDA-MB-435 cells after
incubation with 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) for 48 h, using a pulse assay
measuring [35S]methionine incorporation. We found a 25%
decrease in the percentage increase of isotope incorporation in
2ME2-treated cells (P = 0.01; Fig. 6A and B). To determine whether

Similar results were confirmed by Western blotting of cyclin B1

cyclin B1 were increased at both 16 and 24 h in P435 cells, whereas

Novel Mechanisms of 2-Methoxyestradiol

We have previously shown that this cell line derived from
parental MDA-MB-435 (P435) has two acquired point mutations
in the class I (M40) h-tubulin both at the DNA and protein levels
(14). Immunofluorescence and in vitro polymerization assays
showed that 2ME2-driven tubulin depolymerization is impaired
in 2ME2R cells (14).
We studied 2ME2-mediated cell cycle events in this 2ME2R cell
line and delineated tubulin-dependent versus tubulin-independent
effects of 2ME2. We found that treatment of P435 with 2ME2 led to
an accumulation of cells at G2-M, but no major G2-M arrest was
seen in 2ME2R cells. We also found that P435 cells underwent
apoptosis in a time-dependent manner in response to 2ME2,
whereas 2ME2R cells did not undergo apoptosis when treated with
2ME2. Furthermore, we observed phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein
only in P435 cells, consistent with an earlier report (25). These data
strongly suggest that regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis by 2ME2
is tubulin dependent.
Cell cycle–related genes that were increased in 2ME2-treated
MDA-MB-435 cells included MAD2, BUB1, and CDC20, which are
involved in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. Cell cycle
progression is monitored by the mitotic spindle assembly
checkpoint, which monitors that all chromosomes have achieved
bivalent attachment to microtubules (27). The target of the
checkpoint control is the APC, a ubiquitin ligase of which the
activation is required for separation of sister chromatids.
Formation of MAD-BUB complexes is crucial for the checkpoint
mechanism (27, 28). On activation of the mitotic spindle assembly
checkpoint, MAD2 binds to and inhibits the APC, causing a
metaphase arrest and preventing securin and cyclin B1 proteolysis
by blocking its ubiquitination, which is critical in controlling the
metaphase-anaphase transition (24, 27).
We found that securin and cyclin B1 proteins were increased in
2ME2-treated P435 cells, suggesting that the APC is inhibited. In
contrast, we found that cyclin B1 was not increased in 2ME2R cells,
and the increase in securin was attenuated in 2ME2R cells.
Furthermore, using flow cytometry, we found that cyclin B1 levels
were increased at G2-M in 2ME2-treated P435 cells, but not in
resistant 2ME2R cells. This suggests that 2ME2 inhibits APC in a
tubulin-dependent manner.
Progression of prophase to metaphase is controlled by
activation of the cdc2/cyclin B1 complex (29). Cdc2 (or p34cdc2),
a G2-M regulatory protein that controls entrance to and exit from
M-phase, is activated in P435 cells. Phosphorylation status of cdc2
showed that phosphorylation of Thr161 representing the active
form was increased in response to 2ME2 treatment in P435 cells
but not in 2ME2R cells, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr15
(inactive form) was decreased. This suggests that P435 cells had
entered metaphase. However, further entry into the anaphase
depends on the destruction of cyclin B1/cdc2 activity by APC. Based
on the up-regulation of cyclin B1 and activation of cdc2, P435 cells
were arrested at metaphase. Taken together, these results suggest
that the presence of tubulin mutations in 2ME2R cells may affect the
association of cyclin B1/cdc2 complex with the microtubules via
inhibition of the APC, resulting in altered cell cycle response in
2ME2R.
To exclude the possibility that 2ME2 is directly binding to and
inhibiting the APC, we evaluated the direct effect of 2ME2 on the
APC in an APC ubiquitination assay. We found that the addition of
2ME2 in this assay did not inhibit ubiquitination of the substrate
Clb2, which shows that 2ME2 does not directly bind to and inhibit
the APC.

Figure 6. [35S]Methionine pulse assay. Protein translation in MDA-MB-435 cells
after incubation with 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) for 48 h was measured using a pulse assay
using [35S]methionine. There was a 25% decrease in the percentage increase
of isotope incorporation in 2ME2-treated cells (P = 0.01; A and B ) and a 52%
decrease in the percentage increase of isotope incorporation in 2ME2-treated
cells (P = 0.02; C and D ), showing that 2ME2 inhibits protein translation in a
tubulin-independent manner. Bars , SD.

inhibition of protein translation by 2ME2 was tubulin dependent,
we next treated 2ME2R cells with 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) for 48 h and
used a pulse assay. We found a 52% decrease in the percentage
increase of isotope incorporation in 2ME2-treated cells (P = 0.02;
Fig. 6C and D), showing that 2ME2 inhibits protein translation in
a tubulin-independent manner.

Discussion
Several studies reported multiple functions of 2ME2, including
disruption of microtubule dynamics by its binding ability to the
colchicine binding site of tubulin, regulation of cell cycle and
apoptosis, and dysregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (26).
However, the mechanisms of actions of 2ME2 are still complex.
D’Amato et al. (11) showed that 2ME2 binds to the colchicine
binding site of tubulin, which suggested that mitotic arrest by
2ME2 was attributed to the inhibition of tubulin polymerization.
However, Attalla et al. (10) subsequently showed that 2ME2 caused
complete metaphase arrest at concentrations that do not inhibit
the assembly of mitotic spindles; thus, whether or not the
regulation of the cell cycle by 2ME2 is dependent on interaction
with tubulin has remained unclear.
In the present study, we first sought to identify potential targets
that were differentially regulated in response to 2ME2. Using long
oligo-spotted microarrays, we found the cell cycle, apoptosis, and
cytosolic ribosome Gene Ontology categories differentially
expressed in 2ME2-treated MDA-MB-435 cells. Using a stable
2ME2-resistant cell line (2ME2R), we further explored whether
these functions are tubulin dependent or not.

inhibition of protein translation by decreasing expression of genes
involved in the formation of the ribonucleic protein complex via a
tubulin-independent mechanism. Protein translation inhibition
was maintained in a highly 2ME2-resistant cell line, and therefore
this mechanism does not contribute to the antiproliferative effect
of 2ME2. Whether this contributes to antitumor activity in vivo
requires further investigation.

Genes in the cytosolic ribosome category, which are responsible
for the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex, were significantly decreased in 2ME2-treated cells, and therefore we hypothesized that 2ME2 inhibits protein translation. In numerous cancers,
general protein synthesis rates and the expression of several
translation components are significantly elevated, supporting the
potential importance of translational control in tumor progression
(30). Using a [35S]methionine pulse assay, we found an inhibition of
protein translation in 2ME2-treated MDA-MB-435 cells. We also
found that 2ME2 significantly inhibited protein translation in 2ME2R
cells, showing that inhibition of protein translation by 2ME2 acts via
a tubulin-independent pathway. Because 2ME2R cells are highly
resistant to 2ME2, yet 2ME2 significantly inhibited protein
translation, this suggests that the effects on protein translation are
not important to the antimitotic effect of 2ME2.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the cell cycle, apoptotic, and
APC regulatory effects of 2ME2 are tubulin dependent. These
mechanisms are important aspects of the antimitotic effect of
2ME2, as they were diminished in a highly 2ME2-resistant cell line.
We also discovered a novel mechanism of action of 2ME2:
