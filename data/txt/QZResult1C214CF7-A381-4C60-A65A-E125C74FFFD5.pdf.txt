Abstract
P53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) has been described as primary p53 target gene,
induced upon DNA damage. More than 10 years after its discovery, its physiological role in the
DNA damage response remains enigmatic, as it seems to be able to execute life–death decisions in
vitro, yet genetic ablation in mice failed to reveal an obvious phenotype. Nonetheless, evidence is
accumulating that it contributes to the fine-tuning of the DNA-damage response by orchestrating
critical processes such as caspase activation or nuclear factor κB translocation and can also exert
additional nuclear functions, for example, the modulation of translesion synthesis. In this review,
we aim to integrate these observations and propose possible unexplored functions of PIDD.

INTRODUCTION
Genotoxic stress poses a dangerous threat to the integrity of the genome. It is therefore not
surprising that cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to adequately process sustained
DNA damage.1 One central mediator of the cellular signalling response after DNA damage
is the tumor suppressor p53.2,3 In unstressed conditions, p53 is rapidly ubiquitinated by
Mdm2 and subsequently degraded via the proteasomal pathway. However, in response to
DNA damage p53 is posttranslationally modified at various residues, for example, by
phosphorylation or acetylation that prevents or fine-tunes its ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation.4 These events lead to stabilization and translocation of p53 into the nucleus,
where it induces the transcription of numerous target genes containing p53-binding sites in
their promoter. Those target genes can have such different outcomes as apoptosis (for
example, Noxa, Bax and Puma), cell cycle arrest and repair (for example, p21 and
GADD45), induction of autophagy (for example, DRAM and Sestrin2) or inhibition of
glucose metabolism (for example, TIGAR). The exact mechanisms that regulate the
differential expression of specific target genes are not definitely established until now.

Transcription and subsequent translation of p53 target genes leads to arrest of the cell cycle
and repair of the DNA damage and, if the damage is too severe and can not be repaired
properly, cell death mediated mainly via the intrinsic Bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway.

One p53 target gene that can modulate the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in response to genotoxic stress downstream of p53 is the p53-induced protein with a death
domain (PIDD). PIDD was first described in the year 20005,6 and contains a leucine-rich
repeat domain at the N-terminus followed by two ZU5 domains and a death domain (DD) at
the C-terminus. Over the last decade, there have been numerous publications reporting on
possible functions for PIDD, none of them entirely convincing, summarized and discussed
in this review.

PIDD DISCOVERY

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

PIDD was first described in the year 2000 by two research groups independently. Telliez et
al.6 identified a protein dubbed LRDD (leucine-rich repeats and death domain containing
protein) in a bioinformatics search for proteins with a DD, similar to the DD of receptor
interacting protein (RIP-1). They already noted that LRDD/PIDD is processed within the
cell (see below) and detected interactions with other (see Table 1), but not all, DD
containing proteins. The second group5 used differential display of an erythroleukemia cell
line transfected with a temperature sensitive p53 mutant (p53ts A135V). One gene
upregulated after culturing the cell line at the permissive temperature was named PIDD, a
splice variant of which being equivalent to LRDD. The promoter for the PIDD gene
contained a bona fide p53-binding site, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) itself is strongly
induced after overexpression of functional p53 or γ-irradiation (IR). No induction was
observed in several cell types deficient for p53, which additionally had lower basal levels of
PIDD mRNA. Overexpression of PIDD reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis
comparable to p53 overexpression. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides targeting PIDD
mRNA for degradation led to reduced apoptosis in response to γ-IR.5

PIDD ISOFORMS
The human PIDD gene is located on chromosome 11 and contains 16 exons. The full length
PIDD protein (isoform 1) is made up by 910 amino acids and contains seven N-terminal
leucine-rich repeat domains, followed by two ZU5 domains and a C-terminal DD. Several
other isoforms have been described:12,11,13 isoform 2 contains a deletion between amino
acids 705 and 721; isoform 3, also known as LRDD, lacks the first 147 amino acids and
harbors a deletion between amino acids 580 and 590; isoform 4 lacks the first 314 amino
acids, and therefore the leucine-rich repeat domain; isoform 5, which has so far only been
identified with bioinformatic methods12 and was not further investigated biologically,
contains only the two ZU5 domains and is alternatively spliced giving rise to a frameshift
and therefore a different C-terminus (Figure 1a).
Whereas isoforms 1 and 3 are expressed in all tissues examined, with the exception of
skeletal muscle, isoform 2 mRNA is only detectable in liver, pancreas and leukocytes.
Isoform 4 is expressed in all tissues including skeletal muscle, but not in the heart.12,13 The

lack of reliable antibodies recognizing and discriminating endogenously expressed mouse
PIDD isoforms, however, make validation of these findings at the protein level difficult.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Despite initially being described as a gene upregulated in response to DNA damage in a
p53-dependent manner, not all genotoxic stressors induce PIDD. Surprisingly, PIDD mRNA
levels of isoforms 1 and 2 remain unchanged in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or
treatment with etoposide or doxorubicin, whereas isoform 3 was induced after UV and
etoposide but downregulated after doxorubicin.12 Of note, basal levels of PIDD protein,
presumably isoform 1 or its autoprocessing products (see below), can also be detected in cell
lines lacking functional p53, such as in p53−/− HCT116 colon cancer cells, indicating that
basal protein expression does not rely on this transcription factor.12

PIDD PROCESSING

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

PIDD is involved in both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways (see below), accordingly there
should be a means to regulate participation of PIDD in one or the other. Surprisingly, the
decision which path to take is imprinted (at least in part) within PIDD itself. PIDD contains
two conserved ‘HFS motifs’, also present in the nuclear pore protein Nup98 and ZUD/
Unc5cl, a positive regulator of nuclear factor (NF)κB signalling, related to PIDD.14 Similar
to Nup98,15 PIDD uses an intramolecular reaction to cleave the peptide bond between the
phenylalanine F445 and the serine S446, leading to the generation of the fragments PIDD-N
and PIDD-C.7 Cleavage at a second HFS site at serine S588 within PIDD-C leads to the
generation of the PIDD-CC fragment (see Figure 1b). PIDD-N contains the leucine-rich
repeat domain and one ZU-5 domain, the biological function of this polypeptide remains
unknown. The PIDD-C fragment is composed of one ZU-5 domain and the DD, whereas the
PIDD-CC fragment only harbors the DD. As the full length PIDD protein is hardly
detectable in most cell types, it is believed that it is rapidly processed to PIDD-C. The
second cleavage occurs in response to high or prolonged genotoxic stress, therefore leading
to accumulation of the PIDD-CC fragment. However, in thymocytes or primary
keratinocytes, the CC fragment appears to be the dominant form detectable, implicating that
processing of PIDD can be the default program, even in the absence of genotoxic stress.9,16
Another report shows additional processing products upon PIDD or LRDD overexpression;
however, the exact nature of those fragments has not been investigated in more detail,11 but
N-terminal protein sequencing may help to identify the nature of these PIDD-derived
polypeptides.
So how is cleavage regulated? PIDD can be part of a complex containing various molecular
chaperones like HSP70, HSP90 or p23, where HSP90 and p23 only interact with full length
PIDD in the cytoplasm.17 Accordingly, HSP90 is required for PIDD processing into the
PIDD-N and PIDD-C fragments, presumably by facilitating a conformation of PIDD that is
favorable for the cleavage reaction. After processing, HSP90 is released from PIDD and the
latter can participate in complex formation with various interaction partners (see below).
HSP90 seems to be required for both processing to PIDD-C as well as PIDD-CC, although it
is at present unclear how exactly processing to PIDD-CC is regulated by HSP90, as both
PIDD-CC and HSP90 have been shown not to interact with each other. One possibility

would be the involvement of HSP70, which is able to bind both PIDD-C and -CC, for the
second processing step, however this has not yet been tested experimentally.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

A further mode of regulation of PIDD processing occurs posttranscriptionally via generation
of the aforementioned isoforms by differential splicing. Isoform 2 carries a small deletion,
which includes the second HFS motif, and is therefore only able to be processed to PIDD-N
and PIDD-C, but not to the PIDD-CC fragment.12
PIDD is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but can also be present in the nucleus.8 In
response to DNA-damaging agents or heat shock, PIDD can translocate to the nucleus where
it localizes to nucleoli11 and is able to interact with the nucleolar protein nucleolin or
chromatin, either directly or via interaction with DNA repair proteins, which remains to be
determined.9

THE ROLE OF PIDD IN CASPASE-2 ACTIVATION AND APOPTOSIS

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Various binding partners of PIDD have been described (see Table 1), implicating PIDD in
different cellular signalling pathways (see Figure 2). The most studied interaction of PIDD
is with caspase-2 and RIP-associated ICH1/CED3-homologous protein with death domain
(RAIDD) in a complex termed the PIDDosome.10 Caspases are cysteine-driven aspartases
involved in several cellular pathways, including cell death, inflammation, migration or
differentiation.18 Apoptotic caspases in mammals can be grouped into initiator caspases (8,
9 and 10) and effector caspases (3, 6 and 7). Initiator caspases become activated upon
hetero- or homodimerization in high molecular weight complexes formed in response to
apoptotic stimuli like the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) for caspases-8 and -10
or the apoptosome for capsase-9. Once activated and processed within these complexes, the
initiator caspases cleave and thereby activate the effector caspases. Of note here, processing/
cleavage of initiator caspases can also occur as a secondary event by effector caspasemediated proteolysis, and is therefore not equivalent to activation. Hence, detection of
initiator caspase fragments by western blotting is not indicative for their activation that
requires proximity-induced dimerization.19,20
Caspase-2 possesses some unique features.21 As it contains a caspase recruitment domain
(CARD) in its long prodomain, it can structurally be classified as initiator caspase.
However, in contrast to the other initiator caspases, caspase-2 is not able to cleave effector
caspases under physiological conditions. In addition, caspase-2 is the only caspase that can
be detected within the nucleus, either constitutively, or upon induction of DNA damage,
although its precise function there is still under discussion.
As mentioned above, initiator caspases need high molecular weight complexes for
activation, and for caspase-2 this complex was found to involve the proteins RAIDD and
PIDD.10 Within this complex, RAIDD acts as an adaptor between PIDD and caspase-2,
making use of its CARD domain to bind the CARD domain of caspase-2 and binding the
DD of PIDD with its own DD. This complex is formed spontaneously upon incubation of
cell extracts at 37 °C and leads to processing and activation of caspase-2. Furthermore,
RAIDD seems to be the only CARD domain-containing protein capable of binding
caspase-2, and RAIDD only interacts with caspase-2 among all CARD domain-containing

caspases. However, RAIDD may not interact exclusively with caspase-2 and PIDD, as it
was initially found as an interaction partner of RIP-1.22

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Several reports describe PIDDosome formation in response to different death-inducing
conditions. Transient global cerebral ischemia in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in
rats leads to increased levels of the PIDD-CC fragment, PIDDosome formation and
processing of caspase-2.23 Cell death accompanied with ischemia/reperfusion injury in the
brain seems to be dependent on PIDD, as in vivo knockdown of PIDD decreases apoptosis
as well as caspase-2 processing. Of note, recent data suggest that PIDD, in contrast to
caspase-2 and RAIDD, is not required for cell death induced by β-amyloid, a neurotoxic
protein involved in Alzheimers disease (C. Troy et al., submitted).
Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 was recently shown to trigger
caspase-2 processing in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and patient-derived cell
samples.24 In this study, knockdown of PIDD did not cause differences in tumor cell
survival upon LBH589 treatment. However, both RAIDD and caspase-2 seem to be essential
for cell death induction and able to act upstream of caspase-9. Additionally, whereas
caspase-2 cleavage was still observed after knockdown of PIDD, it was impaired after
knockdown of RAIDD, yet formal evidence that caspase-2 is indeed the most apical caspase
activated in this setting was not provided.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Another chemotherapeutic drug shown to induce caspase-2 processing is fluorouracil, a
pyrimidine analog. Fluorouracil-induced apoptosis is dependent on p53 and caspase-2,
which is in this setting reportedly activated before caspase-3.25 However, the observed
caspase-2 processing again seems to be independent of the PIDDosome, as knockdown of
PIDD or RAIDD had no influence on apoptosis. Although the exact mechanism is not clear,
fluorouracil was shown to upregulate CD95 expression and to induce the formation of a
complex involving caspase-2, caspase-8, FADD and CD95 that may orchestrate its
activation.26
An alternative cell death pathway engaging caspase-2 has been described based on
experiments with zebrafish embryos.27 In this model, caspase-2 is selectively activated in
response to DNA damage in p53-mutated zebrafish embryos if checkpoint kinase 1 is
inhibited simultaneously. This treatment apparently leads to apoptosis of p53-deficient cells,
frequently resisting DNA damage-induced killing, in a caspase-2-dependent manner. It will
be interesting to investigate whether PIDD and/or RAIDD are involved in this specific
pathway of caspase-2 activation and, if so, how they communicate with the DNA-damage
response machinery.
Surprisingly, despite the compelling evidence for a participation of the PIDDosome in cell
death induced by various apoptotic substances, both caspase-2, RAIDD as well as PIDD
knockout mouse models do not support a critical role of the PIDDosome in developmental
or stress-induced apoptosis.16,28,29 Furthermore, activation of caspase-2 is proficient in cells
lacking PIDD, indicating that other pathways for caspase-2 activation are likely to exist. In
addition, both PIDD- and RAIDD-deficient cells were able to induce the formation of high
molecular weight complexes containing caspase-2.16 In contrast, the caspase-2 processing

observed was dependent on mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and effector
caspase activation, placing caspase-2 downstream in the apoptotic cascade. Conflicting data
regarding a rate-limiting role for the PIDDosome in cell death triggered by agents disrupting
microtubule dynamics, such as vincristine or paclitaxel, has been reported. One study
reported cell death in primary low passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) that was
dependent on all three PIDDosome components,30 yet our own observations in primary as
well as SV40-immortalized MEF lacking caspase-2 or PIDD do not support these
findings.16 A similar discrepancy appears to exist in MEF transformed with different
oncogenes and exposed to γ-IR.16,31 Although the mode of immortalization (E1a/Ras vs
SV40 large T antigen) may well have an impact on the DNA damage response, the different
findings reported for primary MEF exposed to microtubule poisons remain currently
unexplained.
One phenotype that has been reported for caspase-2-deficient mice was an increased
sensitivity of oocytes after genotoxic stress.29 However, this sensitivity was not observed in
PIDD-deficient oocytes, again indicating a PIDD-independent function for caspase-2,28
whereas the role of RAIDD in oocytes cell death has not been investigated so far.
Overall, these studies suggest that caspase-2 can be a secondary target of other executioner
caspases where it might act as part of an amplification loop rather than an essential initiator
caspase. However, in certain tumor cell types, frequently lacking p53, caspase-2 can be
activated upstream of mitochondria, but this activation does not strictly depend on PIDD.
Consistently, the pro-apoptotic function of PIDD may engage other effectors than caspase-2
for cell killing.32

PIDD IN NFκB ACTIVATION AND CELL SURVIVAL
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

DNA damage not necessarily leads to programmed cell death. Several mechanisms have
evolved to allow cells to repair the sustained damage in order to avoid excessive cell death
or the elimination of cells that are not irreparably damaged or paramount to maintain organ
function, such as stem cells. Next to the DNA repair machinery, an important prosurvival
pathway induced by genotoxic stress is the one leading to activation of NFκB.33,34 Although
NFκB appears to exert its most prominent role in the immune system,35 where it participates
in the host defence by inducing the expression of various mediators of inflammation, NFκB
has also been demonstrated to be activated in response to DNA damage, and PIDD seems to
be an essential component of this event. The aforementioned PIDD-C fragment can form a
complex with NEMO (NFκB essential modulator), a component of the IKK (inhibitor of
NFκB kinase) complex and the serine/threonine kinase RIP-1. This protein complex shuttles
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where NEMO is sumoylated.36 This sumoylation is
facilitated by PIDD,8 although at the moment it is not clear whether PIDD directly
influences this reaction, recruits ligases for sumoylation or prevents desumoylation that has
recently been shown to rely on SENP2.37 Sumoylated NEMO is subsequently bound by
ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and phosphorylated at Serine-85.38 This
phosphorylation is required for mono-ubiquitination by cIAP1 and export back to the
cytoplasm, as cells harboring a phosphorylation mutant of NEMO are deficient in both
ubiquitination and nuclear export, but not sumoylation.39

Recently, several publications show further evidence of a highly complex mode of
regulation leading to activation of IKK in response to DNA damage. Immediately after the
damage, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) becomes activated and poly-ADPribosylated, which serves as platform for the recruitment of ATM and protein inhibitor of
activated STAT-4 (PIASy).40 In this signalosome, PIASy acts as a sumo ligase for NEMO,
leading to the retention of sumoylated NEMO in the nucleus.41 Phosphorylation by ATM
bound to NEMO in turn facilitates NEMO export back into the cytoplasm.38 Additionally,
ATM is also exported to the cytoplasm in a Ca2+dependent manner, where it binds
TRAF6.42 This in turn leads to TRAF6 and Ubc13-dependent generation of K63-linked
ubiquitin chains on TRAF6 and ELKS. Ubiquitinated TRAF and ELKS serve as a platform
for the recruitment of TAK1 by TAB2/3, which then phosphorylates and activates
IKKβ.42-44 At the same time, sumoylated NEMO is mono-ubiquitinated and forms part of a
complex with IKKα, IKKβ and ELKS that is essential for IKK activation. This complex
formation is dependent on binding of NEMO to a yet to be identified protein. If any of these
molecular events also involves PIDD remains to be established.

Studies mentioned above using RNA interference and overexpression as well as our own
studies using PIDD-deficient cells show significant defects in NFκB activation in response
to genotoxic stress, but not TNF, at least in tissue culture (Bock et al., submitted). This
seemingly makes PIDD one of the few genes that are exclusively required for NFκB
activation in response to DNA damage, but the analysis of cytokine release upon systemic
challenge of mice with IR suggests that PIDD may still have a role in this process (Bock et
al., submitted). Surprisingly, as mentioned before, PIDD-deficient cells and mice show no
difference in cell survival in response to DNA damage.16,28 This is in stark contrast to other
mouse models lacking genes required for NFκB activation, which generally show decreased
survival and frequently die in utero.45 Furthermore, different models of DNA damageinduced cancer formation failed to show any signs of PIDD-dependency for onset and
severity of disease (Bock et al., submitted, Manzl et al., submitted). Interestingly, also
absence of PARP1, limiting DNA damage-dependent activation of NFκB, fails to modulate
IR-driven tumorigenesis, but, as loss of PIDD, affected cytokine release in response to acute
IR challenge in vivo (Bock et al., submitted). These results suggest that NFκB activation in
response to DNA damage is not sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis or increase repair
efficacy in premalignant cells and in the end has no significant influence on cancer
initiation. We propose it mainly orchestrates cytokine production, as during an immune
response, but do not rule out that it may still be important for tumor cell survival, once
disease is established. In fact, it is well known that different inflammation-induced cancers
are highly dependent on NFκB, mainly by constant secretion of prosurvival and proliferative
cytokines as well as production of prosurvival molecules.46 However, direct evidence that
DNA damage triggered tumor formation is dependent on NFκB is lacking, because all
known components of DNA damage-induced NFκB activation have additional roles, either
in the DNA repair response or in DNA damage-independent NFκB activation making a
clean genetic dissection of individual functions difficult.

PIDD IN DNA REPAIR, CANCER AND DRUG RESISTANCE

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Yet another complex containing PIDD was identified by large-scale IP and mass
spectrometry analysis.9 Within this complex, PIDD interacts in the nucleus with components
of the replication factor complex 5 (RFC5) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in
response to UV-IR. This leads to detachment of the CDK-inhibitor p21, bound to PCNA,
and subsequent degradation of p21 considered as a prerequisite for DNA repair in response
to UV-IR. Additionally, PIDD positively influences mono-ubiquitination of PCNA, thereby
facilitating recruitment of the low fidelity repair DNA polymerase η to chromatin. How
exactly PIDD promotes ubiquitination of PCNA remains unknown, as well as whether the
mechanism involves similar posttranslational modifications facilitated by PIDD on NEMO.
Of note, PIDD-deficiency sensitized the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT to UV-Cmediated cell death as well as primary mouse keratinocytes to the lethal effects of the more
physiological UV-B irradiation in vivo. It will be interesting to see whether this effect
culminates in reduced rates of mutational load and/or altered latency of UV-driven skin
cancer.
The PIDD interaction partner caspase-2 is implicated to act as a tumor suppressor in a model
of B-cell lymphomas.31 However, until now there are no reports whether PIDD has a similar
role in tumorigenesis as caspase-2 or whether the tumor suppressor function of caspase-2
depends on PIDD. Our own studies confirm tumor suppression by caspase-2 in response to
aberrant c-Myc expression but this effect was independent of PIDD, at least in this model
system (Manzl et al., submitted). The latter observation would be in line with a role in low
fidelity DNA repair responses, such as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) also triggered
in response to oncogenic stress.47 Of note here, PIDD was also found to interact with the
catalytic subunit of DNA-activated protein kinase (DNA-PK),9 but the physiological
relevance of this observation remains to be reinvestigated.

Expression analysis of various oral squamous cell carcinomas revealed an association
between the apoptotic index and PIDD expression, in line with its proposed role in
apoptosis.48 Surprisingly, no correlation between p53 status and PIDD expression was
found, arguing for p53-independent PIDD expression changes in these tumors. Another,
although indirect, cue on the role of PIDD in cancer was shown in cell lines or primary cells
derived from patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid
leukemia.49 Those cells are characterized by constitutive NFκB activation that is essential
for their survival, as blocking NFκB activation by ATM inhibition leads to apoptosis. In the
model proposed by the authors, NEMO is activated by nuclear PIDD and ATM, thereby
triggering NFκB signalling.
Furthermore, expression of PIDD was upregulated in the testicular germ cell carcinoma cell
line NT2/D1 after cisplatin treatment, suggesting a role for PIDD in the cell death response
triggered by this drug, as these tumors are frequently cured by cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.50 Consistently, in a mouse model of lung cancer, PIDD was shown to be
highly upregulated in tumors in response to in vivo cisplatin treatment.51 Surprisingly,
however, PIDD overexpression in turn facilitated resistance to cisplatin treatment. Hence, it

will be interesting to see whether high levels of PIDD associate with treatment failure in
patients suffering from lung cancer or testicular germ cell carcinoma.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In a subsequent study it was proposed that PIDD-driven drug resistance to cisplatin might be
caused by sustained p53 activation and increased p21 levels, noted upon PIDD
overexpression, because of induction of a positive feedback loop.52 This loop seems to be
initiated by PIDDosome-dependent Mdm2 cleavage at D367, removing the C-terminal
RING domain required for its E3-ligase function and ΔC-Mdm2/p53 interaction-dependent
stabilization of p53. Although intriguing and in line with a discussed role of caspase-2 in
cell cycle arrest,31 a number of inconsistencies remain. For example, why and how does
small interfering RNA against PIDD or caspase-2, that shortens the time to p53 degradation
because of lack of Mdm2 cleavage, sensitize cells to DNA damage-mediated apoptosis after
doxorubicin treatment? Presumably, the argument would be that less effective induction of
p21 should sensitize to cell death induction, yet impaired p21 induction was not formally
demonstrated in PIDDosome defective cells. A recent study also suggests that knockdown of
caspase-2 can negatively affect p21 levels after DNA damage, but this effect did not require
the proteolytic activity of caspase-2, nor PIDD or RAIDD, suggesting translational
control.53 Nonetheless, sensitization of PIDD-knockdown cells to cell death was also
reported after exposure to UV, but there it correlated with impaired p21 degradation.9
Furthermore, doxorubicin-driven cell death in cells wild type for p53 usually depends on
p53-driven expression of PUMA and/or Noxa, pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family
that should then be activated less effectively as well, culminating in reduced death rates in
the absence of the PIDDosome, but the opposite was observed in U2OS cells lacking
PIDD.52 Analysis of primary lymphocytes and MEF lacking PIDD or caspase-2, however,
did not provide evidence for differences in cell survival in response to several DNAdamaging agents.16,28

FINAL REMARKS
Despite a growing number of research articles, the exact physiological role of PIDD is still
poorly defined. Although PIDD was shown to be a part of several different protein
complexes mediating various signalling pathways when overexpressed, the absence of a
phenotype of PIDD-deficient cells and mice so far excludes an essential role of
physiological importance within those pathways. It is therefore likely that PIDD is either
highly redundant with other proteins, is only required for fine-tuning of certain pathways,
which could not be clearly defined in past work, or, alternatively, may rather be involved in
cellular responses secondary to or different from the DNA-damage response. Production of
inflammatory cytokines downstream of NFκB activation or participation in the sensing of
other types of DNA or damage, for example, in the innate immune response, may be
considered as well. Clearly more and refined research is required to define the biological
significance of PIDD.

Generation of PIDD isoforms by splicing or proteolysis. (a) Currently known PIDD
isoforms. Isoform 1 contains seven leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains at the C-terminus
followed by two ZU5 domains and an N-terminal DD. In isoform 2, the first 146 amino
acids as well as amino acids 580–590 are deleted. Isoform 3 harbors a deletion of amino
acids 705–721. Isoform 4 is composed of the two ZU5 and the DD, whereas isoform 5 has
not yet been experimentally validated. (b) PIDD processing products. Full length PIDD-FL
is processed at S446 to give rise to PIDD-N and PIDD-C. PIDD-C can be further
autoproteolytically cleaved at S588, generating PIDD-CC.

Cellular responses reported to engage PIDD. PIDD is induced in response to DNA damage
in a p53-dependent manner, and depending on the type and severity of the damage is
recruited to different complexes. A low amount of DNA damage leads to autoproteolytical
cleavage of full length PIDD to the PIDD-C form. This fragment associates with NEMO and
receptor interacting protein (RIP-1), thereby facilitating postranslational modifications on
NEMO leading to activation of NFκB. After more severe genotoxic stress, PIDD-C is
further autoproteolytically cleaved to the PIDD-CC fragment, which can bind to RAIDD and
caspase-2, which is subsequently processed and activated. In response to UV-IR, PIDD-C
can displace p21 from proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), thereby facilitating
recruitment of the translesion synthesis repair machinery.
