ABSTRACT
Acquired resistance to PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway inhibitors is often associated
with compensatory feedback loops involving the activation of oncogenes. Here, we
have generated everolimus resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells and in long-term
estrogen deprived (LTED) models that mimic progression on anti-estrogens. This
allowed us to uncover MYC as a driver of mTOR inhibitor resistance. We demonstrate
that both everolimus resistance and acute treatment of everolimus can lead to the
upregulation of MYC mRNA, protein expression and, consequently, the enrichment
of MYC signatures as revealed by RNA sequencing data. Depletion of MYC resulted
in resensitization to everolimus, confirming its functional importance in this setting.
Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrate that MYC upregulation in the everolimus
resistant lines is mediated by increased association of the BRD4 transcription factor
with the MYC gene. Finally, JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor combined with everolimus exhibited
increased tumor growth inhibition in 3D Matrigel models and an in vivo xenograft
model. These data suggest that MYC plays an important role in mediating resistance to
everolimus in ER+ and ER+/LTED models. Furthermore, given the regulation of MYC by
BRD4 in this setting, these data have implications for increased therapeutic potential
of combining epigenetic agents with mTOR inhibitors to effectively downregulate
otherwise difficult to target transcription factors such as MYC.

INTRODUCTION

to ER) [4], aromatase inhibitors (prevents biosynthesis
of estrogen) [5-7] and fulvestrant (downregulates ER)
[8], all of which have shown success in the clinic.
More specifically, third generation aromatase inhibitors
(letrozole, anastrazole and exemestane) have shown
improved overall survival and have become the standard
of care for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer
[5-7]. While most patients respond to endocrine agents,
eventually a majority will display resistance to such agents
[9]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive
this resistance is crucial to overcoming these clinical
hurdles. It is necessary, therefore, to have appropriate
biological models in place to help determine molecular
drivers of resistance and to test pre-clinical hypotheses.
The long-term estrogen deprived (LTED) model
originally developed by the Arteaga group involves
growing ER+ breast cancer lines in the absence of

Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer
diagnosed and is responsible for the second most fatalities
in women. An extremely heterogeneous disease, breast
cancer is comprised of patients that fall into different
disease segments based on their tumor’s histotype; namely,
hormone (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and Her2
status. The largest disease segment within breast cancer
is hormone receptor positive disease, with approximately
75% of patients falling into this category [1-3].
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors typically
rely on circulating estrogen for their growth. Given this
dependence, treatment options for ER+ breast cancer
patients have relied heavily on anti-hormonal strategies
with varying anti-estrogen modalities. These include such
agents as tamoxifen (competes with estrogen for binding

estrogen [10]. These LTED cell lines eventually lose
their dependence on estrogen and mimic clinical tumors
progressing on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors [10].
Their predictive nature is underscored by the similarities
between LTED gene signatures and the gene signatures
of patients treated with hormonal agents. These LTED
models provide very useful tools in understanding primary
and secondary mechanisms of resistance in ER+ breast
cancer patients. Indeed, the LTED model has implicated
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway’s involvement in mediating
resistance to anti-estrogens [10]. These and other studies
have resulted in many initiatives to understand and target
members of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR family.
Everolimus (Rad001), is an allosteric inhibitor of
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), demonstrating efficacy
in many different cancer types, including renal cell
carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and
advanced kidney tumors, all of which everolimus is
FDA-approved for [11]. Most recently, FDA approval
was achieved based on data from the BOLERO-2 trial,
demonstrating that everolimus in conjunction with
exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, improves progressionfree survival compared to exemestane alone in postmenopausal women with advanced ER+, Her2-negative
breast cancer [12-13]. Very importantly, while progressionfree survival was significantly improved, recent data has
been released suggesting no improved overall survival in
this disease segment [14]. These recent data suggest that
the combination of exemestane and everolimus does not
give a durable clinical response, indicating a need for
alternative combinations and therapeutic strategies.
To understand and overcome this potential onset
of drug resistance, here we describe the generation of
everolimus-resistant cell lines both in parental and longterm estrogen-deprived (LTED) backgrounds of ER+
breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that cells resistant
to everolimus have an activated MYC signature due to
upregulation of MYC expression at the transcript and
protein levels. We further show that this upregulation of
MYC is mediated by BRD4 regulation of the MYC gene
and that combining a BRD4 inhibitor with everolimus
leads to enhanced tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in
vivo.

concentrations of everolimus until growth inhibition
in the presence of compound was no greater than 50%
(and the GI50 was significantly different than parental
counterparts) (Figure 1A). Importantly, parental lines
were maintained in culture for similar lengths of time as
the everolimus-resistant versions, to control for long-term
culture effects.
We next assessed biochemical changes in the
eveR lines. Acute inhibition of mTOR by everolimus
should result in lack of kinase activity and consequently,
decreased phospho-targets specific to mTOR (e.g. S6 at
Serine 240/244 (pS6) and 4EBP1 at Serine 65 (p4EBP1).
To determine whether alterations in the mTOR pathway
were responsible for the onset of resistance, pS6 and
p4EBP1 expression was examined. Importantly, pS6, an
mTOR-p70S6K target, was relatively undetectable levels
in all eveR lines after extended exposure to everolimus,
suggesting this portion of mTORC1 signaling remains
targetable in this context and is likely not contributing
to the resistant phenotype (Figure 1B). In contrast, we
observed a variable response in p4EBP1. Phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 was decreased in MCF7-eveR cells as well as in
ZR75-eveR, albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, p4EBP1
was slightly upregulated in SUM52 cells, and was
relatively unchanged in CAMA-eveR cells (Figure 1B).
In addition, western blot analyses of ER expression was
assessed in the eveR derivatives. While eveR in MCF7
resulted in decreased ER expression, the opposite result
was seen in CAMA and ZR75 cells (Supplemental Figure
1). Although pS6 is consistently downregulated in eveR
lines, the variability in 4EBP1 phosphorylation and ER
expression levels suggests context-dependent responses to
long-term everolimus treatment.
Given clinical treatment regimens, we hypothesized
that generating everolimus resistance in cell lines that
model aromatase inhibitor treatment would parallel that
of treatment orders seen in patients. Indeed, patients
previously treated with endocrine agents were the focus of
the BOLERO-2 trial, and for which everolimus treatment
has been approved despite lack of change in overall
survival in the clinical study [12-14]. For this reason, in
addition to generating resistance to everolimus in the four
ER+ parental breast cancer cell lines, we also generated
resistance in MCF7 and ZR75 LTED counterparts. This
resulted in four derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 cells:
long-term culture (Parental, Par, P), everolimus-resistant
(eveR, eR), long-term estrogen deprived (LTED, L) and
everolimus-resistant LTED (LTED-eveR, LeR) (Figure
1C). In a short-term cell proliferation assay, MCF7LTED and ZR75-LTED were much less sensitive to
everolimus than their parental counterparts (Figure 1A
and 1D). Despite this, long-term exposure to everolimus
resulted in complete resistance to the drug in the MCF7
setting (Figure 1D). While ZR75-LTED exhibited relative
resistance to everolimus compared to the parental cells,
ZR75-LTED-eveR exhibited significantly increased

and LTED-eveR lines

resistance to the drug (Figure 1D). Downstream targets
of mTOR signaling were assessed in LTED derivatives
as well. pS6 was undetectable in both LTED-eveR lines
similar to eveR lines. p4EBP1 was decreased in both
LTED-eveR, however only to a modest extent in the
MCF7-LTED-eveR setting (Figure 1E). Furthermore,
LTED derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 both resulted in
significant loss of ER expression (Supplemental Figure
1). The ER downregulation in the LTED lines is not
surprising, as it has been previously shown that antiestrogens can have varying effects on ER levels in patients
[15].
To rule out differences in growth rates between
derivatives, cells were also plated in a long-term colony
formation assay (Figure 1F). The ability of MCF7 parental
cells to form colonies in the presence of everolimus was
severely impaired. In contrast, MCF7-eveR cells were not
only able to form colonies in the presence of everolimus,
they did so to a greater extent than in the absence of drug.
As expected, the MCF7-LTED line maintained sensitivity
to everolimus in the colony-formation assay, and the
MCF7-LTED-eveR derivative was able to grow in the
presence and absence of drug (Figure 1F). In fact, the
MCF7-LTED-eveR cells formed colonies better than the
MCF7-LTED regardless of everolimus treatment. These
data suggest that lack of sensitivity to everolimus in the
eveR and LTED-eveR lines was not due to any differences
in growth rates between derivatives. In addition, washout
studies demonstrated that eveR and LTED-eveR lines
maintained their resistance to everolimus up to at least
seven days after washing the cells out of drug (data not
shown). To determine whether anchorage-independence
and/or contact with extracellular matrix proteins could
alter the resistant derivatives’ sensitivity to everolimus,
growth was assessed in a three-dimensional Matrigel assay
[16]. The eveR and LTED-eveR cells remained resistant
to everolimus in 3D Matrigel cultures (Figure 1G),
suggesting the cells attachment to basement membrane did
not alter sensitivity. Interestingly, ZR75-LTED appeared to
be more sensitive to everolimus in 3D relative to the 2D
assay. In either case, ZR75-LTED-eveR was significantly
resistant to everolimus compared to ZR75-LTED cells
regardless of assay type (Figure 1D and 1G).
These data demonstrate the generation of cell
lines that are resistant to everolimus treatment in a
variety of proliferation and growth assays and were
considered relevant model systems for further molecular
characterization to determine drivers of resistance. Potent
inhibition of pS6 in all eveR lines suggests that feedback
loops are not playing a role in reactivating pS6, and thus
this portion of mTOR signaling is likely not driving
resistance. Furthermore, the variable responses to another
mTOR target, p4EBP1 prompted us to investigate whether
additional players outside of direct mTOR signaling could
play a more dependable role in all of the eveR lines.

To determine molecular changes that might
contribute to the resistance to everolimus, we performed
whole transcriptome RNA sequencing to provide a global
view of altered pathways in MCF7 derivatives. One of the
most robust changes observed was an increase in MYC
mRNA expression in the MCF7-eveR line compared to
the MCF7 parental line (Figure 2A). Using quantitative
real-time PCR analyses, we validated the RNA sequencing
result demonstrating that MYC mRNA is increased in all
of the eveR lines (Figure 2B, top). Furthermore, increased
protein expression of MYC was also seen in all eveR
lines (Figure 2B, bottom). Gene Set Enrichment Analyses
(GSEA) was used to identify gene signatures associated
with resistance and in concordance with increased MYC
expression, multiple MYC signatures were enriched
(Supplemental Table 1), including those previously
identified in LTED experiments [17]. Additionally,
we show breast cancer specific MYC genes that are
statistically differentially expressed between MCF7-eveR
and MCF7-parental, suggesting the increased MYC is
functional in this setting (Figure 2C) [17-19].
Similar to the parental and eveR lines, we saw
an increase in MYC mRNA by RNA sequencing in the
MCF7-LTED-eveR line compared to the MCF7-LTED
line (Figure 2D). These results were validated by qPCR
and western blot analyses in both the MCF7 and ZR75
context (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the LTED-eveR also
showed activation of MYC signatures, including breastspecific MYC target genes (Figure 2F and Supplemental
Table 1). These data suggest a common mechanism
of MYC upregulation and activation in response to
everolimus among ER+ breast cancer lines and their
LTED counterparts.
Finally, to rule out the upregulation of MYC being
due to clonal selection or long-term drug treatment effects,
we also examined the expression of MYC in response to
acute treatments of everolimus. Similar to the resistant
setting, acute treatment of everolimus resulted in an
upregulation of MYC protein in both parental and LTED
derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 cells within 72 hours posttreatment (Figure 2G). This suggests that a mechanism to
upregulate MYC expression exists in response to treatment
of everolimus and targeting MYC and mTOR together
might be an effective therapeutic strategy in preventing
the onset of everolimus resistance.

MYC is a driver of resistance to everolimus
We next sought to determine whether the
upregulation of MYC expression observed in eveR
derivatives was of functional consequence in the
everolimus-resistant setting. To address this, two

3B). Furthermore, colony formation assays revealed a
reduced ability of both eveR derivatives to form colonies
when expressing either MYC siRNA in the presence of
everolimus (Figure 3C). Intriguingly, the MCF7-LTED

sequence-specific siRNAs to MYC were employed
(Figure 3A). Importantly, knockdown of MYC resulted in
partial resensitization of MCF7-eveR lines to everolimus
in a short term proliferation assay (Figure 3B). Sensitivity
to everolimus was also restored in MCF7-LTED-

line showed increased growth inhibition when everolimus
was combined with either MYC siRNA (Figure 3B). This
suggests that the expression of MYC (whether pre-existing
or in response to everolimus treatment) can play a role in
determining sensitivity of LTED derivatives to everolimus.
To determine whether MYC was sufficient to cause
resistance to everolimus we employed a tet-inducible
vector to overexpress MYC in MCF7 parental lines.
In the presence of doxycycline, MYC expression was
upregulated in MCF7 cells (Figure 3D). We then exposed
the cells to increasing concentrations of everolimus in the
presence or absence of MYC expression (+/- doxycycline).

Interestingly, MYC expression resulted in significant
recovery of proliferation even at the highest concentrations
of everolimus (Figure 3D). This was in comparison to
cells expressing tet-inducible RFP, which were sensitive
to everolimus regardless of exposure to doxycycline and
the expression of RFP. These results suggest that MYC
expression alone can confer resistance to everolimus in
MCF7 cells. These data underscore the importance of the
MYC upregulation observed in the eveR derivatives and
demonstrate a direct connection between MYC expression
and everolimus sensitivity.

BRD4-mediated upregulation of MYC expression
in the everolimus-resistant setting

by enhanced BRD4 association with the MYC gene
we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analyses. We observed that eveR lines showed increase
binding of BRD4 to the MYC gene (Figure 4A, left).
We also performed ChIP using antibodies specific to
acetylated H3K27, a mark of active transcription. We
observed an acetylated H3K27 mark on the MYC gene in
the MCF7-eveR line relative to MCF7 parental (Figure
4A, right). These data are consistent with the observation
that MYC is upregulated at the transcript level in the
eveR setting (Figure 2). Recently, the small molecule
JQ1 was shown to inhibit BRD4-dependent transcription
by preventing the binding of the BRD4 bromodomain to
acetylated lysine residues [21]. To further test the specific
regulation of MYC by BRD4 in the eveR setting we used
JQ1 in our ChIP analyses. Treatment with JQ1 resulted
in abrogation of BRD4-occupancy at the MYC gene in
eveR lines (Figure 4B). This experiment was repeated
with a second BRD4-specific antibody and obtained

BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) is
a transcriptional regulator that recognizes and binds
acetylated histones and drives transcription of many genes,
including MYC. While MYC regulation by BRD4 has
been extensively studied in hematological malignancies,
relatively little is known about this mechanism in solid
tumors, particularly in breast cancer. A recent publication
outlined a role for BRD-mediated transcription of MYC
in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers [20]. As mentioned
above, the LTED setting mimics patient response to
aromatase inhibition and tamoxifen treatment [10]. Our
observations of MYC upregulation in the eveR setting
and this novel connection between BRD regulation and
tamoxifen resistance prompted us to investigate BRD4 as
a potential regulator of MYC in the eveR lines. In order
to determine whether MYC upregulation is mediated

similar results (Supplemental Figure 2). In concordance
with this, JQ1 treatment resulted in downregulation of
MYC mRNA expression in the eveR lines (Figure 4C).
In fact, JQ1 treatment abolished MYC upregulation in all
eveR and LTED-eveR cell lines, suggesting that BRD4
is responsible for the increased MYC expression in these
settings (Figure 4D and 4E). Interestingly, fractionation
of MCF7 derivatives revealed that global association of
BRD4 with chromatin does not change in the eveR lines
(data not shown). In addition, neither MCF7 nor ZR75
eveR derivatives showed an increase in BRD4 mRNA
expression (Supplemental Figure 3).
These results together suggest that specific BRD4
association with the MYC gene is enhanced in eveR lines
and is responsible for governing high MYC expression in
this context.

in increased cell disintegration, indicative of cell death
(Figure 5). Interestingly, the ZR75-LTED-eveR line was
very sensitive to JQ1, even in the absence of everolimus.
The combination of both drugs significantly reduced
proliferation and greatly induced cell disintegration in the
ZR75-LTED-eveR line (Figure 5). Similar results were
seen with MCF7 cells (Figure 5B).
In SUM52 and CAMA cell lines, we performed a
short term proliferation assay with everolimus, JQ1 and
the combination (Supplemental Figure 4A). In both lines,
addition of JQ1 to everolimus-treated cells resulted in
increased growth inhibition compared with everolimus
treatment alone. Furthermore, a comprehensive 6x6
combination grid of ZR75 derivatives in 2D treated with
both compounds showed an increased growth inhibitory
effect when JQ1 was combined with everolimus
(Supplemental Figure 4B). Interestingly, ZR75-LTEDeveR were resensitized to everolimus to greater extent
in the presence of JQ1 than the ZR75-eveR cell line.
These results suggest that a BRD4-mediated mechanism
of driving resistance can be targeted in the everolimusresistant setting, as well as in combination with acute
treatments of everolimus to increase efficacy.

Combination of everolimus and JQ1 leads to
enhanced growth inhibition
Given the aforementioned role of MYC as a driver of
everolimus resistance, and as a target for BRD4 regulation
in this setting, we hypothesized that treatment with JQ1, a
small molecule inhibitor of BRD4, could be combined with
everolimus to increase growth inhibition. The 3D Matrigel
assay allows us to examine changes in growth while
taking into consideration ECM and basement membrane
interactions that more closely mimic growth in vivo [16].
Therefore, this assay was used to examine responses to
combinations of everolimus and JQ1 (Figure 5). MCF7
and ZR75 derivatives were plated in Matrigel and their
sensitivity to everolimus, JQ1 and the combination were
examined. ZR75 Parental cells were relatively sensitive to
everolimus alone at both concentrations and as previously
shown (Figure 1 and 5A). However, the treatment with
everolimus did not result in cell death. Rather, single
cells remained intact and relatively viable in culture.
Treatment with JQ1 in combination, however, resulted in
an even further decrease in cell number (Figure 5A, right).
This was consistent with the increased disintegration of
cells depicted in the everolimus + JQ1 treatment group,
suggesting the addition of JQ1 caused cell death. As
expected, everolimus treatment of the ZR75-eveR line
resulted in minimal sensitivity to the high concentration
of everolimus, however when combined with JQ1, the
lines were resensitized to everolimus and the combination
resulted in greater attenuation of proliferation (Figure 5A).
In fact, JQ1 resensitized the eveR lines to everolimus to a
level comparable to that of the parental cells treated with
everolimus alone. The ZR75-LTED lines exhibited less
sensitivity to everolimus alone than the parental lines as
seen previously (Figure 1 and Figure 5A). Combinations
of everolimus and JQ1 in the LTED cells significantly
decreased growth compared with either agent alone.
Similar to parental cells, the combination also resulted

Inhibition of mTOR and BRD4 results in greater
efficacy in an in vivo xenograft model
Given the results in 3D, we hypothesized that we
could achieve increased tumor growth inhibition of
everolimus and JQ1 in vivo. We tested the combination
in an MCF7 in vivo xenograft model. After the tumors
reached ~150mm3, mice were treated with vehicle
control, everolimus, JQ1 or the combination. Treatment
with JQ1 showed no efficacy compared to the vehicle
control (Figure 6A). Everolimus treatment alone resulted
in only 50% tumor growth inhibition (TGI). While the
tumor growth inhibition in response to everolimus was
significantly different than the vehicle (p=0.005), we
believe the partial sensitivity would not translate into a
durable clinical response. Strikingly, while JQ1 has no
effect alone, the addition of JQ1 to everolimus resulted
in a statistically significant tumor growth inhibition
compared to either agent alone (p=0.008 compared to
everolimus alone and p=0.0017 compared to JQ1 alone,
TGI= 75% relative to vehicle control). This suggests a
combination benefit for these two agents in producing
a near complete response in this in vivo model (Figure
6A). Furthermore, this suggests the need for additional
therapies to treat the residual and potentially resistant
population. Importantly, body weight loss did not exceed
20% in any of the treatment groups, suggesting the agents
were well-tolerated (data not shown). To determine
whether the addition of JQ1 to everolimus would alter
regrowth capabilities post-treatment, we measured
animals after treatment had ended in the everolimus alone

and in the combination group. The combination-treated
animals had severely impaired regrowth post-treatment
compared to animals that had received everolimus alone
(Figure 6B). In fact, the average change in tumor volume
was statistically significant between groups (Figure 6B,
right). In conclusion, treatment with everolimus in vivo
results in greater in vivo efficacy when combined with
JQ1 suggesting a benefit to adding a BRD4 inhibitor to an
mTOR inhibitor treatment regimen.

transcriptional profiling, we identified a MYC signature
that is upregulated in eveR cells. This corresponds to
transcriptional upregulation of MYC itself. Through
overexpression and knockdown experiments, we have
found that MYC is both necessary and sufficient for
resistance to everolimus. Indeed, previous literature has
linked MYC to the mTOR pathway. In a MYC-driven
model of lymphoma, 4EBP1 is hyperphosphorylated
in an mTOR-dependent manner [22]. In addition, MYC
can cause resistance to rapamycin in prostate epithelial
cells through a mechanism which paradoxically involves
upregulation of 4EBP1 [23]. However, our data are not
consistent with either of these mechanisms, as neither
expression nor phosphorylation of 4EBP1 increases
with MYC upregulation (Figure 1 and data not shown).
Interestingly, MYC is also known to regulate ribosomal
biogenesis through transcription of ribosomal RNAs [24].

DISCUSSION
Here, we demonstrate that resistance to the
mTORC1 inhibitor, everolimus, can be acquired through
the upregulation of MYC mediated by the transcriptional
regulator BRD4. We have generated everolimus-resistant
derivatives of several ER+ breast cancer lines. Through

Additionally, MYC has been shown to control autophagy,
another process regulated by mTOR [25]. These functions
may explain the ability of MYC to bypass the requirement
for mTORC1 activity in this context.
Recently, publications have outlined MYC as a
target for regulation by bromodomain protein, BRD4
[26]. Specifically, BRD4 has been shown to associate
with the MYC gene in hematological malignancies and
drive MYC expression [26]. Given the ability of BRD4
to regulate transcription factors that are difficult to
target, such as MYC, BRD4 has become an attractive
therapeutic target. Published studies have shown that
in MYC-dependent tumors, JQ1 treatment causes
reduced proliferation and increased differentiation as
a consequence of MYC downregulation [21, 26-27].
Furthermore, another BRD4 inhibitor similar in structure
to JQ1, OTX015, is currently being used in phase I
clinical trials for hematological malignancies [28]. These
recent developments underscore the therapeutic potential
of targeting bromodomain proteins. Interestingly, we
demonstrate MYC upregulation as a consequence of
mTOR inhibition which requires BRD4, a known regulator
of MYC. The BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 completely blocks
MYC upregulation after everolimus treatment. With the
recent emergence of BRD4 as a pharmacological target,
this finding raises the intriguing possibility of using BRD4
inhibitors in the clinic to overcome everolimus resistance.
We tested this possibility and observed that JQ1 is highly
effective in killing eveR cells and enhances the antitumor
effects of everolimus in vivo. In further support of this
hypothesis, BRD4 was recently identified as a potential
target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer [20], but has
not yet been linked to mTOR inhibitors. It remains an
open question how mTOR inhibition leads to BRD4
activation on the MYC gene. We do not see any change in
the levels of BRD4 mRNA or its global association with
chromatin after mTOR inhibition. Additionally, we did not
observe any change in the expression of MCL1 (data not
shown), another validated BRD4 target in hematological
malignancies [29]. This not only demonstrates the tissue
specificity of BRD4 function, it indicates the feasibility of
using BRD4 inhibitors and the ability of BRD4 to regulate
target genes such as MYC will have to be evaluated in each
tumor type.
The differential sensitivity to everolimus depending
on the cell line and background (LTED versus parental)
suggests molecular players might be different between
the parental and LTED background. Previous reports have
demonstrated an activation of MYC in the LTED setting
and MYC as a prognostic indicator of anti-estrogen
treatment [17]. Indeed, we have observed an increase in
MYC expression in LTED lines compared to parental
lines (Figure 2G and data not shown). It is possible that
this increased level of MYC has primed the cells for
resistance to everolimus. Our data demonstrating lower
sensitivity to everolimus in the LTED setting versus the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

parental setting parallels this argument (Figure 1 and 5).
Interestingly, we observed a more robust response to the
combination of everolimus and JQ1 in the ZR75-LTEDeveR lines compared to the ZR75-eveR cell line (Figure 5
and Supplemental Figure 4). Given that MYC levels can
determine sensitivity to anti-estrogens [17] and, as shown
here, everolimus-resistance, it is plausible that the LTEDeveR lines rely on MYC to a greater extent. Therefore,
abolishing MYC levels in this setting is more detrimental
to the cells. These data emphasize the importance of
generating resistance in the order seen in the clinic, as it
may have an impact on downstream signaling cascades
and potentially, therapeutic response to future compounds.
While there are caveats to generating resistance
in cell lines, as different contexts can rely on a variety
of mechanisms for growth and response to treatment,
we are encouraged by the fact that all four cell lines and
their LTED derivatives display a unified upregulation of
MYC, as compared to other relevant proteins (4EBP1
and ER levels). Moreover, we believe these cell lines’
varied molecular contexts mimic patient heterogeneity,
highlighting further the importance of MYC upregulation
as a consistent phenotype. Furthermore, we are confident
in the potential combinatorial strategy demonstrated
by our data in 3D Matrigel and in vivo studies; growth
conditions that better recapitulate the patient setting [16].
It will be important to see if similar mechanisms emerge
from the BOLERO-2 trial samples and/or other clinical
data involving mTOR inhibitors.
In summary, we present evidence for a novel
mechanism that places BRD4 and MYC in a pathway
which can promote resistance to mTORC1 inhibition.
Combined inhibition of mTOR and BRD4 overcomes
resistance and may represent a clinically relevant
opportunity to enhance the therapeutic benefit of mTOR
inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
MCF7, ZR75, CAMA-1 (ATCC) and SUM52
(Asterand) and non-LTED eveR derivatives were cultured
in RPMI (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Sigma), 1% L-glutamine
and antibiotics. For cells purchased from ATCC, cell lines
were validated using short tandem repeat (STR) profiling
and data was compared to the ATCC database. All LTED
and LTED-EveR lines were generated and cultured in
phenol red-free media + 10% charcoal dextran-treated fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% L-glutamine and antibiotics.
Everolimus resistance was generated by subjecting the
parental or LTED derivative of each cell line to increasing
concentrations of everolimus up to 500nM and maintained
at this concentration. Generation of everolimus resistant

line. During assays, cells were washed out of everolimus
during plating and treated the following day with indicated
compounds. MYC siRNA experiments were performed
using either siRNA #1 (Dharmacon, D-003282-140020) or siRNA#2 (LifeTech, #S9130) or a non-targeting
siRNA control (Dharmacon). Lines were transfected at
a final concentration of 5nM and the following day cells
were plated for growth assays. pTRIPZ constructs were

and sample set. The CT values were first normalized
to HPRT housekeeping gene control (dCT), and then
normalized to control or DMSO-treated samples (ddCT)
depending on the experiment. Fold change was calculated
using the following formula: 2-ddCT

CellTiterGlo Assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates. As per
manufacturer’s instructions, equal volumes of CellTiterGlo
(Promega) was mixed with the cells and allowed to shake
for 10-15 minutes. Luminescence was measured using a
Tecan at a 1000 second exposure. Cells were normalized
to Day 0 control and % net growth was determined using
the following formula: ((x-y)/(z-y)) x100=% net growth
where x=reading of treated sample at end of study,
y=average reading on Day 0, and z=reading of DMSOtreated sample at end of study. The concentration of
DMSO did not exceed 0.03% for any experiment.

Colony formation assays
Cells were plated in at least duplicate at 5000 cells
per well of a 6-well dish. Media was replaced every 3-4
days with drug where indicated. Colonies were allowed
to form for about 3 weeks or until control colonies were
sufficient to be visualized by eye. At this point, plates were
rinsed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with
0.1% crystal violet, rinsed and dried. Plates were scanned
and representative photos are depicted.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
All ChIP experiments were performed as previously
described with the following modifications: after
crosslinking, cell pellets were lysed directly in nuclear
lysis buffer with 1% SDS [30]. The following primer
sequences were used for ChIP analyses: MYC-(Forward):
gccacctccatgctgtgt, MYC (reverse): agaactcctcctttccagtgc
in the following region: chr8:128,805,744-128,809,484
(3741bp) build HG19 (UCSC Genome Browser). The
primers were designed using Roche UPL.

Three-dimensional Matrigel assays
Phenol-red free growth factor reduced Matrigel
(BD) were plated as previously described [16]. After
plating, cells were incubated overnight before adding
the indicated concentrations of drug. Phase-contrast
photographs were taken using a 20X objective using an
Olympus DP71 microscope and images were captured
using Olympus DP-BSW software.

with sterilized and dust-free bedding cobs, access to
sterilized food and water ad libitum, under a light-dark
cycle (14-hour circadian cycle of artificial light) and
controlled room temperature and humidity. During the
study, mice were supplemented with estrogen pellets
(0.18mg/90-day release; Innovative Research for
America). For implantation, animals were anesthetized
and 1x106 MCF7 cells were implanted in a total of 50uL
(of 50% Matrigel (BD): 50% RPMI media) transdermally
in the third mammary fat pad. Tumors were measured
with vernier calipers, and volumes were calculated using
the formula (L*W2)*0.52. When the tumors reached
an average of 150mm3, the mice were randomized into
treatment groups by tumor volume. Animals were
treated with vehicle control, everolimus at 5mg/kg p.o.
and/or JQ1 at 50mg/kg i.p. once per day for 3 weeks.
In combination treatment, JQ1 and everolimus were
administered at least 6hrs apart to minimize any chance
of drug-drug interaction. The control group received both
i.p vehicle and p.o vehicle given on the same schedule as
the combination group. All procedures were performed in
accordance with federal, state and Institutional guidelines
in an AAALAC-accredited facility and were approved
by the AstraZeneca Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
