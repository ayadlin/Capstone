Abstract
There is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic opportunities for metastatic melanoma. Fragment-based screening has led
to the discovery of orally available, ATP-competitive AKT kinase
inhibitors, AT13148 and CCT129254. These compounds also
inhibit the Rho-kinases ROCK 1 and ROCK 2 and we show they
potently inhibit ROCK activity in melanoma cells in culture and in
vivo. Treatment of melanoma cells with CCT129254 or AT13148
dramatically reduces cell invasion, impairing both "amoeboidlike" and mesenchymal-like modes of invasion in culture. Intra-

vital imaging shows that CCT129254 or AT13148 treatment
reduces the motility of melanoma cells in vivo. CCT129254
inhibits melanoma metastasis when administered 2 days after
orthotopic intradermal injection of the cells, or when treatment
starts after metastases have arisen. Mechanistically, our data
suggest that inhibition of ROCK reduces the ability of melanoma
cells to efﬁciently colonize the lungs. These results suggest that
these novel inhibitors of ROCK may be beneﬁcial in the treatment
of metastasis. Cancer Res; 75(11); 2272–84. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

domain kinases (LIMK1 and 2), myosin light chain (MLC2), and
the myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1) of the myosin phosphatase
(7). Thus, ROCK signaling plays a central role in the organization
of the actin cytoskeleton, and activates myosin II–dependent
contraction of actomyosin ﬁbers, which regulates cell–cell contact
and cell migration (3). Single tumor cells can either move in an
elongated, protrusive mode or in a rounded, bleb-based fashion
often referred to as "amoeboid" movement (8, 9). These two
modes of movement are interconvertible and are both dependent
on actomyosin contractility. However, rounded, bleb-based
movement requires higher levels of actomyosin contractility than
the elongated, protrusive mode (10, 11). Although the ﬁrst
generation of ROCK inhibitors, such as Y27632 (12) and
H1152 (13), inhibits highly contractile, bleb-based movement,
they can convert melanoma cells to elongated, protrusive movement that requires lower levels of actomyosin contractility
(8, 10, 11). Consequently, they fail to block cell migration
completely. Recent studies reported the development of several
new ROCK inhibitors, including, OXA-06 and RKI-18, which
showed good potency against ROCK in vitro and in cells (14,
15). However, the OXA-06 compound has poor pharmacokinetic
properties for use in vivo (14) and no in vivo data for RKI-18 were
reported (15).
In order to identify potent ROCK inhibitors that are active in
vivo, we have studied the novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors
CCT129254 and AT13148, which have been developed to have
good pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and potently inhibit
ROCK in vitro (16, 17). We have carried out these studies in
melanoma cells, because previous work has identiﬁed key roles
for ROCK signaling in invasion of melanoma cells (11, 18, 19)
and we have established an orthotopic model of spontaneous
metastasis for assessment of inhibitors in vivo. Metastatic melanoma shows considerable genetic heterogeneity with mutations
in the proto-oncogenes BRAF and NRAS, and loss of tumor-suppressor genes, including p16INK4, p14ARF, and PTEN (20, 21).

Cancer metastasis is a multistep process that involves migration
of tumor cells, local invasion, entry into the circulation, arrest at
secondary sites, extravasation, and colonization (1). Many studies
implicate the Rho family of small GTPases as key regulators of cell
migration (2). Through their actions on the cytoskeleton and
actomyosin contractility, the Rho-associated kinases, ROCK1 and
ROCK2 (referred to here as ROCK), play a central role in the
regulation of cell migration and affect several components of the
metastatic process, including migration, local invasion, and cell
proliferation (3). ROCK signaling has also been implicated in
stiffening of the extracellular matrix, which has been shown to
contribute to increased cell proliferation and more aggressive
tumor behavior (4, 5). These observations suggest that potent
inhibition of ROCK could impair the metastatic process and
tumor growth, establishing the kinases as attractive targets for
antimetastatic therapies. ROCK1 and ROCK2 belong to the AGC
kinase family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which includes
PKA and AKT/PKB (6), and are activated by binding to active Rho.
Active ROCK phosphorylates several substrates, including LIM

ROCK Inhibitors Block Melanoma Metastasis

Despite the considerable progress using targeted therapies against
oncogenic BRAF and immunotherapies (22), resistance to therapies invariably develops (20, 23). There is, therefore, a need for
additional treatment strategies, including targeting of the metastatic process. We have investigated the effects of ROCK inhibitors
CCT129254 and AT13148 on actomyosin contractility and cell
movement in tissue culture and in vivo to assess effects on
melanoma cell movement. Using the orthotopic melanoma
metastasis model and an experimental metastasis assay, we show
that these agents reduce metastasis and inhibit cell proliferation,
suggesting that inhibition of ROCK in melanoma could be
beneﬁcial in the treatment of metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, treatments, and reagents
A375p and A375M2 human BRAFV600E melanoma cells were
from R. Hynes (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Human melanoma
cells WM266.4, and WM1361 were from R. Marais (Paterson
Institute, Manchester, United Kingdom). All these cell lines were
authenticated by STR proﬁling by LGC standards on June 2014.
4599 and 690cl2 cells were generated by N. Dhomen and R.
Marais (Paterson Institute) from tumors arising in the BrafV600E
mouse model (24) and from tumors arising from the BrafV600E;
Ptenﬂ/ﬂ mouse melanoma tumor model, respectively. The ROCKdeﬁcient melanoma cell lines used in this study were generated
from tumors arising in mice carrying BrafV600E; Ptenﬂ/ﬂ; Rock1F6/wt;
Rock2F5-6/F5-6, Tyr-CreERT2 after induction by tamoxifen treatment. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were derived from
embryos carrying conditionally targeted alleles of Rock1 and
Rock2 (S. Kuemper, A. McCarthy, and C.J. Marshall; manuscript
in preparation), where loxP sites ﬂank exon 6 of Rock1 (Rock1F6)
and exons 5–6 of Rock2 (Rock2F5-6). These cells were transformed by infection with retrovirus pBABE-p53DD followed by
pBABE-HRasV12 (Addgene plasmids #1768, #9058, respectively);
recombined Rock alleles were generated by infection with Adeno
Cre (Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA)
to generate Rock1DF6/DF6;Rock2 DF(5-6)/DF(5-6). Control cells
(Rock1F6/F6;Rock2F(5-6)/F(5-6)) were generated by infection of the
transformed MEFs with Adeno GFP. CCT129254, CCT130293
(16), and AT13148 (17) were synthesized in-house. MK2206 was
obtained from ChemieTek, H1152 from MERCK Millipore, and
Y27632 from Tocris Bioscience. Rabbit anti-phospho MLC2
(Thr18/Ser19), rabbit anti-phospho PRAS40 clone (C77D7),
rabbit anti-phospho AKT (Ser473) clone (D9E), rabbit anti-total
PRAS40 clone (D23C7), and mouse anti-total AKT clone (40D4)
antibodies are from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse antiMRCL3/MRLC2/MYL9 clone (E-4) is from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.
Gel contraction assay
A total of 106 melanoma cells were embedded in 500 mL of a
2.3 mg/mL collagen-I gel and plated in a 24-well plate. After the
gel was set at 37 C for 1 hour, 500 mL of media, containing
inhibitors or vehicle, was added on top of the gel. After 24
hours, the plates were scanned and the diameter of the gel and
well was measured using the ImageJ software. The extent of
contraction was assessed by subtracting the gel area from the
well area. For each well, we calculated the percentage of gel
contraction using the formula 100  [(area of the gel/area of an
empty well)  100; ref. 19].

3D-invasion assay
Cells were suspended in 2.3 mg/mL of serum-free liquid bovine
collagen at 105 cells/mL. Hundred-microliter/aliquots were dispensed into black 96-well ViewPlates (PerkinElmer) coated with
bovine serum albumin. Plates were centrifuged at 300  g and
incubated in a 37 C/10% CO2 tissue culture incubator. Once
collagen had polymerized, serum-depleted medium with either
drugs or vehicle was added on top of the collagen. After 24-hour
incubation at 37 C in 10% CO2, cells were ﬁxed and stained for 4
hours in 4% formaldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5
mg/mL Hoechst 33258 nuclear stain (Invitrogen). The plates were
then imaged by Operetta High Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer) using Z-planes at 0, 30, and 60 mm. Nuclear staining was
quantiﬁed by the Harmony software package (PerkinElmer) at
each plane. The invasion index was calculated as the sum of the
number of cells at 30 and 60 mm, divided by the total number of
cells. Samples were run in quadruplicate and averaged. Data were
expressed as mean from three independent experiments.
Western blot
Cells were seeded on plastic 6-well plates at a density of 5  105
cells per well and allowed to adhere for 2 hours, then serum
starved for 16 hours and further treated with inhibitors for
the indicated times. Cells were lysed in SDS loading buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mmol/L
dithiothreitol) and boiled for 10 minutes. Cell lysates were
resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF-FL membranes
(Millipore). Membranes were incubated with indicated antibodies and visualized by ﬂuorescently conjugated secondary antibodies using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).
Quantiﬁcation of the Western blot analyses was operated by
LI-COR software (Image studio lite Ver3.1).
Time-lapse microscopy
Cells were seeded on top of 1.7 mg/mL collagen-I gel in
medium containing 10% serum and allowed to adhere for 2
hours then medium was changed to 0% serum with inhibitor or
vehicle. Imaging started 16 hours after treatment for a further 24 to
40 hours.
Intravital imaging
Nude mice were injected subcutaneously with A375M2 human
melanoma cells expressing GFP-LifeAct. Tumors were imaged
when they reached 3 to 7 mm. Five mice in each group were
dosed with drug twice: once 24 hours before imaging and again 2
hours before imaging. Doses of 200 mg/kg for CCT129254 and 40
mg/kg for AT13148 were used for treatments. Imaging was performed as previously described (25).
Orthotopic melanoma metastasis assay
All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the Institute of Cancer Research in accordance with
National Home Ofﬁce regulations under the Animals (Scientiﬁc
Procedures) Act 1986. 4599 mouse melanoma cells (2  105 cells)
were injected intradermally into the lateral ﬂanks of 6- to 8-weekold female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2 rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice; 2
days after injection, the mice were randomly divided into two
groups, one group was treated with vehicle only and the other
with the drug. CCT129254 was administered at 200 mg/kg in 10%
DMSO, 5% Tween 20 in saline, p.o., CCT130293 was administered at 20 mg/kg in 10% DMSO, 1% Tween 20 in saline, i.p., the

dosing schedule for both drugs was 5 to 7 days. At the end of the
experiment, lungs and tumors were excised and ﬁxed in 4%
buffered formalin overnight; macroscopic metastases were
counted in the lungs using a dissecting microscope. Primary
tumors and lungs were embedded in parafﬁn, gross morphology
was assessed on H&E-stained sections. IHC for Ki67 was performed using anti-Ki67 (1:300; Abcam; ab16667). In the lungs,
Ki67-positive cells were counted in ﬁve individual metastases and
in the case of the primary tumors Ki67-positive cells were counted
in ﬁve ﬁelds of view per tumor at a magniﬁcation of 400.
Experimental metastasis assays
Extravasation assay. 4599 melanoma cells were labeled with either
Cell Tracker orange (CMRA) at 5 mmol/L or Cell Tracker green
(CMFDA) at 1 mmol/L and pretreated with either vehicle,
CCT129254 (40 mmol/L), or CCT130293 (10 mmol/L) for 40
hours. The cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with their respective
vehicle-treated control and 1  106 cells were injected into the tail
vein of CD1 athymic mice. The mice were culled 2 and 24 hours
after injection, the lungs were perfused with 5-mL PBS as
described in Malanchi and colleagues (26), excised and ﬁxed in
4% buffered formalin overnight. Fluorescent images were collected using the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and the number
of green and orange cells was quantiﬁed in 12 ﬁelds of view per
lung at a magniﬁcation of 200.
Lung colonization assay. 4599 melanoma cells expressing luciferase were pretreated with either CCT129254 (40 mmol/L) or
CCT130293 (10 mmol/L) for 40 hours; 1  106 cells were injected
into the tail vein of CD1 athymic mice. Twenty-four days after
injection, the mice were subjected to ex vivo bioluminescence
imaging using the IVIS Lumina II (Xenogen Corporation); luminescence was quantiﬁed using Living Image software (Xenogen
Corporation). The lungs were ﬁxed in 4% buffered formalin
overnight, embedded in parafﬁn, and IHC for Ki67 was performed as described previously.
Statistical analysis
P values were generated using ANOVA in Figs. 4B and C and 5B
and C. For the scatter plot in Fig. 3B, the Mann–Whitney U test was
used. For all remaining quantiﬁcations, the Student t test was
performed. Unless otherwise stated, error bars indicate SD.

Results
CCT129254 and AT13148 are potent inhibitors of ROCK-driven
actomyosin contractility
Fragment-based screening together with medicinal chemistry
has led to the discovery and development of compounds targeting
AKT/PKB, including the orally available, ATP-competitive kinase

inhibitors AT13148 and CCT129254 (16, 17, 27). In vitro screening of AT13148 against a panel of kinases shows that it is a multiAGC kinase inhibitor, with potent activities against ROCK1 (IC50
¼ 6 nmol/L), ROCK2 (IC50 ¼ 4 nmol/L), and AKT1, 2, and 3 with
IC50 values of 38, 402, and 50 nmol/L, respectively (17).
CCT129254 inhibits ROCK1 and ROCK2 (IC50 ¼ 214 nmol/L
and 141 nmol/L, respectively) and AKT2 (IC50 ¼ 2.2 nmol/L;
ref. 16). Screening against MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinaserelated Cdc42-binding kinase)-a and -b showed that both compounds exhibit very low potency toward MRCK-a (IC50 ¼ 1,510
nmol/L and 33,000 nmol/L for AT13148 and CCT129254, respectively) and MRCK-b (IC50 ¼ 1,140 nmol/L and 33,000 nmol/L
for AT13148 and CCT129254, respectively). Compound
CCT130293, which was developed from the same chemical series
as CCT129254, also inhibits AKT (IC50 ¼ 5 nmol/L), but exhibits
very low potency toward ROCK (IC50 ¼ 5,788 nmol/L). Further in
vitro screening of CCT129254, AT13148, and CCT130293 against
a panel of 140 kinases revealed that several AGC kinases are
commonly inhibited (>70% inhibition) by 1 mmol/L of
CCT130293 and either of AT13148 (1 mmol/L) or CCT129254
(1 mmol/L), including PKA, AKT, p70S6K, RSK1/2, PRK, and MSK
(Supplementary Table S1). Thus, the pair of inhibitors
CCT129254 and CCT130293 provides a set of tools to dissociate
between the ROCK-dependent and ROCK-independent signaling.
Using MLC2 phosphorylation at Thr18 and Ser19, a well
substantiated read out for ROCK activity in cells (3, 7), we show
that 5-minute treatment of 4599 mouse melanoma cells with
either CCT129254 or AT13148 potently inhibits phosphorylation
of MLC2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). As expected from
previous work (16, 17), CCT129254 and AT13148 strongly
inhibited AKT downstream signaling as shown by the decrease
in Thr246 phosphorylation of the proline-rich Akt-substrate
(PRAS40). The potency of both compounds toward the inhibition
of MLC2 phosphorylation is independent from effects on AKTregulated signaling, as CCT130293, an ATP-competitive inhibitor
of AKT that does not inhibit ROCK, and MK-2206, an allosteric
inhibitor of AKT, strongly inhibit AKT activity and AKT-downstream signaling but have no effect on phosphorylation of MLC2
(Fig. 1B). The ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors CCT129254,
CCT130293, and AT13148 increased Ser473 AKT phosphorylation through stabilization of the ligand-bound phosphorylated
protein to dephosphorylation (28), in contrast to the allosteric
AKT inhibitor, which inhibits PI3K-dependent phosphorylation
of AKT on Ser473 (29). Phosphorylation of MLC2 can also be
triggered in cells by the MRCKs-a and -b (10). However,
CCT129254 and AT13148 exhibit very low potency toward
MRCK-a (IC50 ¼ 1,510 nmol/L and 33,000 nmol/L for AT13148
and CCT129254, respectively) and MRCK-b (IC50 ¼ 1,140 nmol/L
and 33,000 nmol/L for AT13148 and CCT129254, respectively),
indicating that the potency of the compounds toward the

inhibition of MLC2 phosphorylation is mediated by their effect on
ROCK. The on-target efﬁciency of the compounds was further
conﬁrmed by the dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of
LIMK-substrate coﬁlin, a well-established target of ROCK-dependent signaling (Fig. 1A).
In order to benchmark CCT129254 and AT13148 to that of the
prototypical ROCK inhibitors Y27632 and H1152 (12, 13), we
measured the level of inhibition of MLC2 phosphorylation in
4599 melanoma cells after 30 minutes of treatment with various
concentrations of CCT129254, AT13148, Y27632, and H1152
and determined their respective EC50s (Fig. 1C). We show
that AT13148 is the most potent inhibitor of ROCK (EC50 ¼
0.1 mmol/L) followed by H1152 (EC50 ¼ 0.5 mmol/L), then
Y27632 (EC50 ¼ 1.9 mmol/L) and CCT129254 (EC50 ¼ 4
mmol/L; Fig. 1C). We next sought to assess the sustainability of

ROCK inhibition by each of the compound by determining their
24 hour-EC50s. Results presented in Fig. 1D show that inhibition
of ROCK by AT13148 is stable over 24 hours (24-hour EC50 ¼ 0.1
mmol/L), whereas both Y27632- and H1152 dose–response
curves exhibited a shift toward lower potency after 24 hours of
treatment (24-hour EC50 of 3.6 mmol/L and 6.4 mmol/L, respectively). In contrast, CCT129254 dose–response curve was shifted
toward a higher potency after 24 hours of treatment (24-hour
EC50 ¼ 2.2 mmol/L), showing the higher stability of CCT129254
and AT13148 over time (Fig. 1D). In order to strengthen the
observation that CCT129254 and AT13148 are potent inhibitors
of ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility, we assessed their effect
on cell-induced contraction of collagen lattices (30). Results
presented in Fig. 2A show that CCT129254 and AT13148 are as
good as or better inhibitors of collagen contraction in both 4599

and 690 melanoma cell lines than Y27632 and H1152. The
selected concentrations for both compounds exhibited a marginal
effect on the viability of 4599 and 690 melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Figure 2A also shows that reduction in contractility is independent of inhibition of the AKT-mediated signaling,
as inhibition of AKT activity by either MK2206 or CCT130293 has
no impact on melanoma cells-mediated gel contraction.
Potent inhibition of ROCK by CCT129254 and AT13148
induces cytoskeletal collapse and reduces cell movement both
in vitro and in vivo
Actomyosin contractility is essential for the maintenance of cell
shape; partial inhibition of actomyosin contractility through
treatment with low doses of the myosin II ATPase inhibitor
blebbistatin (31) leads to an increased number of protrusions
in cells with an elongated, protrusive morphology (Fig. 2B).
However, strong inhibition of actomyosin contractility resulting
from treatment with high doses of blebbistatin (25 mmol/L) leads
to a collapsed morphology with a round cell body and multiple,
highly dynamic protrusions (Fig. 2B; ref. 10). Treatment of 690
melanoma cells with CCT129254 (10 mmol/L) or AT13148
(1 mmol/L), or a high dose of blebbistatin (25 mmol/L), led to
a collapsed morphology (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Movies S1–
S3), which was also seen in other melanoma cell lines (not
shown). However, treatment with Y27632 (10 mmol/L) or
H1152 (5 mmol/L) led to an increase in the length of protrusions
similar to a low dose of blebbistatin (2.5 mmol/L) rather than a
collapsed morphology. Thus, treatment with CCT129254 or
AT13148, but not Y27632 or H1152, mimics the action of
complete inhibition of myosin II by blebbistatin. Importantly,
the collapsed morphology induced by CCT129254 or AT13148
treatment was also seen following genetic deletion of Rock1 and
Rock2, because cells derived from a mouse model of melanoma
with Pten deletion and BrafV600E mutation, with loss of three
alleles of Rock (S. Kuemper, A. McCarthy, and C.J. Marshall;
manuscript in preparation) also exhibited a collapsed morphology when cultured on top of a thick collagen-I gel (Fig. 2B). In
contrast, CCT130293 that inhibit AKT, but not ROCK, did not
cause a collapsed morphology (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these
results conﬁrm that the dramatic effect of CCT129254 and
AT13148 on actomyosin contractility and melanoma cell morphology is mainly due to their potency as inhibitors of ROCK.
Treatment with ROCK inhibitors Y276352 or H1152 induces a
switch from a highly contractile-bleb based, rounded, amoeboidlike movement to a low contractile, elongated, protrusive mesenchymal-like mode of migration (9, 32, 33). Inhibition of both
types of cell movement by ROCK inhibitors alone has so far been
unsuccessful. Furthermore, there are reports showing that treatment with Y276352 or H1152 can enhance protrusive mesenchymal-like cell migration (8, 11). Because our studies show that
CCT129254 and AT13148 are more potent than Y276352 and
H1152 in sustaining high level of inhibition of MLC2 phosphorylation, we tested the efﬁcacy of the compounds on the inhibition
of different modes of cell movement in tissue culture. We selected
a panel of cell lines with different genetic backgrounds and
different migratory behavior in a 3D environment and subjected
them to assays of invasion into collagen-I gels that is permissive
for both rounded, amoeboid-like movement and elongated,
protrusive movement (8, 11). 4599 mouse melanoma cells and
WM1361 human melanoma cells mainly move with a rounded
morphology in a soft 3D collagen-I matrix, whereas 690 mouse

www.aacrjournals.org

melanoma cells exhibit an elongated morphology. WM2664
human melanoma cells invade as a mixture of rounded and
elongated cells (11, 34). CCT129254 or AT13148 treatments
consistently inhibit all modes of invasion in a dose-dependent
way; irrespective of the genetic background of the tested melanoma cell line (Fig. 3A), whereas Y276352 and H1152 had
variable effects. This ﬁnding demonstrates that ROCK activity is
needed for both amoeboid and elongated modes of movement.
Importantly, neither CCT130293 nor MK-2206 affected melanoma cell invasion in collagen-I (Fig. 3A), arguing that inhibition of
AKT is not responsible for the block in invasion.
To investigate whether CCT129254 or AT13148 inhibited
melanoma cell movement in vivo, we used intravital imaging of
GFP-LifeAct-expressing A375M2 melanoma cells, which have
been shown to use amoeboid, rounded movement, and elongated
protrusive movement in vivo (35), in CCT129254- or AT13148treated athymic mice. Figure 3B shows that tumor cell movement
is consistently impaired upon treatment with the compounds
(Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results show that potent inhibition
of ROCK, by either CCT129254 or AT13148, decreases melanoma
cell motility both in vitro and in vivo.
Inhibition of melanoma metastasis by CCT129254
In order to assess the effect of the compounds on spontaneous
melanoma metastasis, we set up an orthotopic assay of melanoma
metastasis that recapitulates all the steps of metastasis (invasion,
intravasation, survival in blood stream, extravasation, and growth
at the secondary site) rather than the more limited assay of
experimental metastasis by tail vein injection that only evaluates
survival in blood stream, extravasation, and growth at the secondary site. Suspensions of 2  105 melanoma cells were injected
into the dermis of immune-deﬁcient NOD scid gamma (NSG)
mice, and macroscopic lung metastases scored 24 days later. The
4599 mouse melanoma cells (24, 36) generated a consistently
high number of lung metastases (50  10 foci/lung) in this
experimental setting. First, we used a schedule of treatment where
2 days after intradermal injection of 4599 melanoma cells,
CCT129254, CCT130293, or vehicle were administered using
cycles of 5 days treatments/2 days of rest; the size of the primary
tumor were monitored for 24 days. After 24 days, the lungs were
collected and macroscopic metastases scored (Fig. 4A). In this
experimental setting, both compounds signiﬁcantly slow down
the growth of the primary tumor (Fig. 4B and C) and both
treatments led to a decrease in the number of macroscopic
metastases (Fig. 4D and E). Because in this treatment regime
growth of the primary tumor is affected, it is difﬁcult to separate
effects on metastasis from effects on growth of the primary tumor.
However, we found that a discontinuous schedule where 2 weeks
of drug treatment are followed by a 10-day treatment-free period
has smaller effects on primary tumor growth (Fig. 4G and H).
With this treatment schedule CCT130293 treatment did not affect
the number of macroscopic metastases (Fig. 4I), whereas
CCT129254 treatment led to a strong decrease in the number of
metastases, with a marginal effect on the growth of the primary
tumor (Fig. 4I). This suggests that the CCT129254-mediated
decrease in metastasis is not solely the consequence of inhibition
of tumor growth at the primary site. We next sought to test the
ability of CCT129254 to reduce the progression of the disease in a
more clinically relevant setting where treatment starts after metastasis has been established. In this setting, treatment starts 15 days
after intradermal injection of the cells and lasts for a further 15

ROCK Inhibitors Block Melanoma Metastasis

days, at the end of which lungs were collected and the number of
macroscopic metastases scored (Fig. 5A). We show that although
both CCT129254 and CCT130293 treatments slightly reduced the
growth of the tumor at the primary site (Fig. 5B and C), only
CCT129254 treatment consistently decreased the number of
macroscopic metastases (Fig. 5D and E). We showed, through
analyzing Ki67 staining that CCT129254 treatment, but not
CCT130293 treatment, induced a decrease in the number of
proliferating cells in the metastases, suggesting that a part of the
mechanism of action of CCT129254 involves the inhibition of
metastatic cell proliferation (Fig. 5F and G). In order to conﬁrm
that ROCK and AKT are inhibited in vivo, we carried out a
pharmacodynamic study of CCT129254 and CCT130293. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows that in tumors from treated mice,
CCT129254 inhibits both ROCK, as shown by decreased phosphorylation of MLC2, and AKT as shown by decreased phosphorylation of PRAS and increased phosphorylation of Ser473 of AKT
(28), whereas CCT130293 only inhibits AKT activity.
Previously reported pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
analysis of AT13148 has established an orally administrated dose
of 40 mg/kg as the optimal, therapeutically active concentration in
male athymic mice (17). Although we could show a consistent
impairment of the motility of melanoma tumor cells in culture
and in vivo (Fig. 3B), as well as an impairment of primary tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. S3) in nude mice, we experienced
high toxicity when using AT13148 in the heavily immuncompromised NSG mice required for the spontaneous metastasis
assay. Therefore, in order to avoid toxicity-driven issues, we did
not pursue AT13148 in further studies on metastasis and focused
on CCT129254.
ROCK inhibition decreases outgrowth of melanoma cells in the
lung
We have shown that treatment with CCT129254 inhibits
proliferation at the metastatic site. However, as metastasis is a
multistep process, we sought to determine whether other steps
during metastasis are affected by CCT129254. Efﬁcient colonization of the lung parenchyma and the subsequent formation of
macrometastases involves survival in the blood stream, entry
into the lung, survival, and proliferation in the new, "hostile"
environment (1). In order to test whether the survival in the
blood stream and extravasation are affected by CCT129254
treatment, we performed an assay in which we transiently labeled
4599 melanoma cells with either orange CMRA or green CMFDA
CellTracker dyes and then treated the orange or green labeled
cells for 40 hours with the inhibitors or vehicle. Treated cells and
their differently labeled controls were then mixed 1:1 and
injected into the tail vein of athymic mice. Lungs were collected
at 2 and 24 hours after injection and scored for the number of
orange and green cells. Importantly, neither CCT129254 nor
CCT130293 treatments affected the survival of the melanoma
cells in the blood stream or their extravasation potential as the
same number of compound-treated and vehicle-treated cells

were lodged in the lungs 2 hours after the injection (Fig. 6A).
Drug treatment did not increase the clearance of the melanoma
cells from the lungs as the same number of inhibitor-treated and
vehicle-treated cells remained 24 hours after injection (Fig. 6A).
Similarly, we found no difference in the number of CCT129254treated and vehicle-treated cells at 0.5, 6, and 24 hours after
injection when using a different melanoma cell line 690 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
As we have shown that survival in the blood stream and
extravasation are unchanged, we next sought to determine whether the colonization of the lungs is affected by the CCT129254mediated inhibition of ROCK. We applied an experimental
metastasis approach similar to the extravasation assay (see Materials and Methods), using luciferase-expressing 4599 melanoma
cells that, after 40 hours of pretreatment with the compounds,
were injected into the tail vein of athymic mice and their luminescence measured 24 days after the injection. Importantly, we
show that lungs injected with the CCT129254-treated cells exhibit
a consistently lower luminescence count than the control or
CCT130293-treated cells (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that
CCT129254-mediated inhibition of ROCK reduces the ability of
the melanoma cells to efﬁciently grow in the lung. Similar results
were found with another melanoma cell line 690 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). To strengthen our ﬁndings that ROCK signaling is
required for outgrowth in the lungs, we used genetic deletion of
Rock1 and Rock2 in MEFs derived from Rock1ﬂ/ﬂ/Rock2ﬂ/ﬂ embryos
(S. Kuemper and C.J. Marshall; unpublished data) that were
infected with pBABE-p53DD (37) and pBABE-HRasV12 to generate transformed cell lines (see Materials and Methods). These
were then treated in culture with either AdCre to excise the ﬂoxed
Rock alleles, or AdGFP as a control. Using the lung colonization
assay, we showed that injection of the Rock-deﬁcient MEFs led to
a consistently lower number of macroscopic lung metastases
than the control transformed MEFs (Fig. 6C), conﬁrming that
ROCK activity is needed for efﬁcient colonization of the lung
parenchyma.

Discussion
Metastatic spread is responsible for the majority of melanomarelated deaths. The median survival time of patients with metastatic melanoma is 8 to 9 months and the 3-year overall survival
rate is less than 15% (38). Despite signiﬁcant progress made in the
last decades, much remains to be discovered about how the
metastatic process is initiated and sustained (1), and how to
block growth of metastases. As the Rho kinases ROCK1 and
ROCK2 have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements
involved in cell motility and invasion that are key steps in
metastasis, we sought to investigate whether two compounds,
CCT129254 and AT13148, which are potent ROCK inhibitors in
vitro and have good pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, would
affect metastasis in an in vivo melanoma model of spontaneous
metastasis.

We show that treatment with CCT129254 reduces metastatic
load (Fig. 4D and I) even when treatment starts after metastases
have been established (Fig. 5D). Importantly, these effects of
CCT129254 are mediated by ROCK inhibition as another
member of the same chemical series, CCT130293, which does
not inhibit ROCK, had limited effects on metastasis in this
model (Figs. 4I and 5E). Importantly, we show that both
compounds signiﬁcantly reduce AKT-mediated signaling in the
tumors from the treated animals but only CCT129254 consistently inhibited MLC2 phosphorylation (Supplementary

2282 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

Fig. S2). Unfortunately, we were not able to test AT13148 in
the spontaneous metastasis model as it proved too toxic to the
heavily immunocompromised NSG mice used in these assays.
However, we were able to show that both CCT129254 and
AT13148 blocked melanoma cell migration in vivo as shown by
intravital microscopy (Fig. 3B) and cell invasion in a 3D culture
model. Signiﬁcantly, compared with ROCK inhibitors Y27632
and H1152, treatment with CCT129254 and AT13148 blocked
both the rounded "amoeboid" and elongated, protrusive mode
of cell migration in 3D culture (Fig. 3A). Treatment with ROCK

ROCK Inhibitors Block Melanoma Metastasis

inhibitors Y27632 or H1152 can induce cells moving in a
rounded, "amoeboid" fashion to convert to elongated, protrusive movement (11). Because actomyosin contractility is
required for all forms of cell movement on the basis of these
results we have previously concluded that other routes to MLC2
phosphorylation such as the CDC42–MRCK pathway can provide the actomyosin contractility for elongated, protrusive
movement (10). However, our ﬁndings with AT13148 and
CCT12954 that do not inhibit MRCK and produce a more
sustainable inhibition of ROCK than Y27632 or H1152 show
that ROCK is involved in elongated, protrusive movement in
some cells. As alternative forms of movement are interconvertible (32), and have been proposed as ways that tumor cells
can continue to invade when one mode of movement is
blocked (39), the ability of CCT129254 and AT13148 to block
both modes of movement is of considerable interest. Strikingly,
treatment with CCT129254 or AT13148 led to a collapsed
cytoskeletal phenotype (Fig. 2B) like that produced by high
doses of the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (10), showing that
actomyosin contractility was strongly inhibited. This collapsed
cytoskeletal morphology was also seen in cells where ROCK1
and ROCK2 had been genetically depleted but not in cells
treated with ROCK inhibitors Y27632 or H1152 (Fig. 2B).
Because actomyosin contractility is essential for all modes of
cell migration (32, 33), it is likely that the pronounced effects of
CCT129254 and AT13148 on cell movement are a consequence
of their potent inhibition of actomyosin contractility. The
in vitro kinase screen presented in Supplementary Table S1
revealed that in addition to the inhibition of ROCK,
CCT129254 exhibits a high potency toward the inhibition of
S6K1, AKT1, PKA, and MSK, and although we show that
CCT130293, which exhibits a very similar inhibitory proﬁle
to CCT129254 but does not inhibit ROCK, does not affect any
of the actomyosin contractility-driven processes, the inﬂuence
of inhibition of these additional kinases on the in vitro and in
vivo phenotypes cannot be entirely discarded.
Extravasation of circulating tumor cells from the blood
stream into distant tissues is an essential step in metastasis.
We found that CCT129254 treatment did not affect the ability
of cells to lodge in the lung; however, outgrowth to form
tumor nodules was affected (Fig. 6B). Treatment with
CCT130293, which does not inhibit ROCK, had no effect on
the outgrowth of extravasated cells. This result argues that
proliferation at the secondary site requires ROCK. To gain
further support for this idea, we genetically deleted Rock1 and
2 from MEFs transformed by mutant p53 and HRASV12 such
cells failed to grow in the lung, after tail vein injection (Fig.
6C). Growth of disseminated tumor cells at secondary sites
requires cell proliferation. Strikingly, we found that
CCT129254 treatment led to inhibition of proliferation in
metastases (Fig. 5F), whereas treatment with CCT130293 did
not. This inhibition of proliferation may reﬂect a direct
requirement for ROCK in cell proliferation that has been seen
in some cell types (40, 41) but not all (42). Interestingly, as
demonstrated by Sahai and colleagues (42), the dependence of
cells on ROCK may be context-dependent as Ras-transformed
ﬁbroblasts do not require ROCK signaling for proliferation
when cultured under anchorage-dependent conditions, but do
in anchorage-independent conditions. However, the role of
ROCK in tumor proliferation may be indirect as Samuel and
colleagues (4) have shown that ROCK-dependent remodeling

www.aacrjournals.org

of the extracellular matrix can enhance cell proliferation
through stimulation of b-catenin signaling. Thus, a requirement for ROCK signaling in cell proliferation may only be seen
in situations in which there is dependence on the tumor
microenvironment.
In conclusion, we show that two new ROCK inhibitors
AT13148 and CCT129254 potently inhibit ROCK-mediated functions in melanoma cells. We show that inhibition of ROCK by
CCT129254 impairs the migration of cells in tumors and the
growth of melanoma cells in the lungs. Importantly, we show that
CCT129254 treatment reduced the growth of established metastases arguing that the effects of CCT129254 are not just mediated
by effects on cell migration from the primary tumor. We show that
the effects we observe on inhibition of cell proliferation in
metastases by CCT129254 require ROCK inhibition, which suggests that such compounds may be useful in treating metastatic
disease.
