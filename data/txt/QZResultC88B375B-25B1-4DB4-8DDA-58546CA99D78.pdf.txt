ABSTRACT
Highlights:
•	 exogenous SOD increases apoptosis by sub-toxic disulfiram without copper
overload
•	 H2O2 generation from glucose oxidase also potentiates disulfiram toxicity
•	 N-acetylcysteine suppresses antitumor potentiation of DSF by H2O2 generation
•	 sub-toxic tetrathiomolybdate inhibits potentiation of DSF by SOD
Background: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (SODs) like the extracellular SOD3
and cytoplasmic SOD1 regulate cell proliferation by generating hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2). This pro-oxidant inactivates essential cysteine residues in protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTP) helping receptor tyrosine kinase activation by growth factor
signaling, and further promoting downstream MEK/ERK linked cell proliferation.
Disulfiram (DSF), currently in clinical cancer trials is activated by copper chelation,
being potentially capable of diminishing the copper dependent activation of MEK1/2
and SOD1/SOD3 and promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxicity. However,
copper (Cu) overload may occur when co-administered with DSF, resulting in toxicity
and mutagenicity against normal tissue, through generation of the hydroxyl radical
(•OH) by the Fenton reaction.
Purpose: To investigate: a) whether sub-toxic DSF efficacy can be increased
without Cu overload against human melanoma cells with unequal BRAF(V600E)
mutant status and Her2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells, by increasing
H2O2from exogenous SOD; b) to compare the anti-tumor efficacy of DSF with that of
another clinically used copper chelator, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM)
Results: a) without copper supplementation, exogenous SOD potentiated
sub-toxic DSF toxicity antagonized by sub-toxic TTM or by the anti-oxidant
N-acetylcysteine; b) exogenous glucose oxidase, another H2O2 generator resembled
exogenous SOD in potentiating sub-toxic DSF.
Conclusions: potentiation of sub-lethal DSF toxicity by extracellular H2O2 against
the human tumor cell lines investigated, only requires basal Cu and increased ROS
production, being unrelated to non-specific or TTM copper chelator sequestration.
Significance: These findings emphasize the relevance of extracellular H2O2 as a
novel mechanism to improve disulfiram anticancer effects minimizing copper toxicity.

INTRODUCTION

toxic because of the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO),
which can damage cells through non-selective oxidation
of proteins, lipids, fatty acids, and nucleic acids [19–21].
In humans, several neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease [22, 23] are also
characterized by dysregulated copper homeostasis. One
of the purposes of this study was to take advantage of the
frequent higher levels of mitogenic ROS in cancer cells, to
further increase their ROS and promote their preferential
cell death [16]. For this purpose, we used disulfiram
(DSF), a Cu chelator which has been shown to have an
important potential as an anti-cancer agent [24–27]. The
DSF molecule, tetraethylthiuram disulphide, decomposes
under acidic conditions or upon reduction of its disulphide
bridge to yield two diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC)
molecules [28], which also chelate copper and induce
copper-dependent stimulation of ROS [29]. The induction
of ROS also occurs by the DSF-mediated chelation of Cu
which inhibits SOD1 favouring accumulation of O2*− [29].
Tumor cells were reported to respond to Cu deficiency
induced by Cu chelators like TTM within the low μM range,
by up-regulating the human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1)
[30, 31, 33]. Glutathione (GSH) is an abundant physiologic
copper chelator and elevated GSH levels enhance hCtr1
expression and transport of copper and platinum [32]. Some
mechanisms of acquisition and elimination for Cu are shared
by platinum agents like oxaliplatin and cisplatin [33, 34],
which function as competitors for hCtr1-mediated copper
transport, resulting in reduced cellular copper levels [33,
34]. Since extracellular superoxide anions and H2O2 have
been implicated in stimulation of proliferation [35–37],
this report investigated whether exogenous addition of
SOD [35] or glucose oxidase [38, 39] a source of limited
amounts of H2O2 [38] augment the anti-tumor efficacy of
sub-toxic DSF without increasing Cu. This was based on
our earlier demonstration that H2O2 plays an important role
in Cu[DEDTC]2 cytotoxicity, since the latter is counteracted
by exogenous peroxidase activity [29].

Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element in living
systems due to its requirement in a number of enzymes like
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, important in fueling
cell proliferation [1], copper-zinc dependent SODs required
to modulate oxidative stress [2], and copper-activated
MAP kinase kinase MEK1 responsible for phosphorylating
the mitogen-activated proteín kinase ERK [3]. Basal Cu
can help to produce mitogenic reactive oxygen species
(ROS) inducing survival and proliferation signaling by
moderate levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) capable of
inhibiting redox-sensitive phosphatases which antagonize
proteins regulating signal transduction from growth factor
and cytokine receptors [4–6]. ROS generation by Cu and
H2O2 can act to promote survival or cell death depending
on the extent, persistence and spatiotemporal localization
of ROS in specific subcellular compartments inside the
cells. Mitogenesis is also controlled through superoxide
productionby NADPH oxidases (NOX) enzymes [7] that
become activated by recruting Rac1, a small Rho GTPase,
critical in promoting malignancy [8, 9]. Rac1-activated
NOXs act by transferring electrons from NADPH to
molecular oxygen to produce extracellular or intracellular
superoxide anion (O2*−) [11] which cannot cross negatively
charged biological membranes. To prevent excessive O2*−
overproduction and to generate H2O2-mediated signaling,
cells use the copper-dependent SOD1, a cytosolic enzyme
that dismutates O2*− into H2O2 (2). However, besides
its dismutating activity, SOD1 can also directly regulate
NOX-dependent O2*− production by binding to Rac1 and
inhibiting its GTPase activity [11]. Oxidation of Rac1 by
H2O2 uncoupled SOD1 binding reversibly, producing a selfregulating redox sensor for NOX-generated O2*− production
[11]. This has led to the suggestion that SOD1 can regulate
Nox2-dependent O2*− production through its ROSsensitive control of Rac-GTP hydrolysis. [11]. Targeting
NADPH oxidase components to plasma membrane or
to other subcellular compartments also helps membrane
localization of ROS and activation of downstream redox
signaling events [12]. We had a special interest in the
plasma membrane NOX [12], a generator of extracellular
O2*− which may be dismutated to H2O2 catalytically by
extracellular Cu/Zn SOD3, an enzyme that interacts with
sulfated glycosaminoglycans which localize this enzyme
[13]. In contrast, uncharged extracellular H2O2 diffuses
across membranes in mammalian cells to a limited extent but
could readily enter cytoplasm through aquaporin channels
[14]. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of NADPH
oxidase abrogated radiation-induced intracellular O2*−
generation [15], implying that NADPH oxidase can promote
either extracellular or cytosolic production of O2*− [14, 15].
Besides the ability of ROS to promote mitogenic signaling
that drive aberrant cell proliferation, excessive ROS can
lead to DNA damage responses [16–18]. Particularly, in the
presence of Cu overload, unprocessed H2O2 becomes highly

RESULTS
Exogenous SOD promotes sublethal DSF
toxicity antagonized by thiomolybdate or
N-acetylcysteine in human melanoma cell lines
irrespective of V600E-BRAF status
Since plasma membrane NOX activity can produce
extracellular superoxide anions important in cell survival
[35–37], exogenous SOD was tested for its ability to
potentiate sub-toxic concentrations of DSF. Neither 0.15 μM
DSF nor 250 units/ml of exogenous SOD exerted significant
toxicity against C8161 melanoma or V600E-BRAF mutant
A375 melanoma. However, joint treatment with both agents
significantly killed both cell types. Addition of 3 μM TTM,
another Cu chelator [30, 45] or the glutathione precursor
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) [32] reversed the toxicity induced

by SOD and 0.15 μM DSF, in contrast with the lack of
toxicity of TTM as a single agent (Figure 1A & 1B).

[38, 39]. This revealed no toxicity by DSF or glucose
oxidase at the concentrations indicated when used as
single agents. However, their joint addition significantly
increased melanoma cell death, partly attenuated in the
BRAF-mutant A375 cells (Figure 2B).

Apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage is increased
by DSF and SOD and antagonized by copper
chelator TTM

Toxicity of lethal DSF concentrations is
antagonized by higher sub-toxic TTM levels in
melanoma cell lines

To find out whether the potentiation of sub-toxic
DSF by exogenous SOD involved apoptosis-associated
PARP cleavage [29], we used immune blotting. This
revealed partial PARP cleavage in cells singly exposed to
DSF. However, the ratio of cleaved to intact PARP was
increased when cells were jointly treated with SOD and
DSF. In both cell types irrespective of their BRAF status,
PARP cleavage was reversed by 3 μM TTM (Figure 2A).

When co-administered with Cu, both DSF [30, 43]
and TTM [45] have been used as anti-cancer agents.
Since Figures 1&2 showed that sub-toxic 0.15 μM DSF
potentiation by exogenous SOD is reverted by 3 μM
TTM, we also investigated whether TTM reverted cell
death induced by toxic 0.3 M DSF in the absence of
exogenous SOD. This confirmed that TTM without copper
supplementation above that pre-existing in culture medium
and serum supplementation is not toxic as a single agent
up to 5 μM against C8161 or A375 cells. In contrast, 0.3
μM DSF toxicity was counteracted by 3 or 5 μM TTM,
which by itself was toxic without Cu co-administration at
≥ 10 μM, compared to controls (Figure 3A).

Glucose oxidase enhances DSF toxicity
preferentially in C8161 cells
Since exogenous SOD enhancement of sub-toxic
DSF mediated cell death (Figure 1) is likely to involve
dismutation-mediated H2O2 generation, we also used
exogenous glucose oxidase, another H2O2 generator

a mutant p53 R175H [29, 41]. Cytofluorometric livedead analysis indicated a majority of live cells in control
cultures or in those singly treated with DSF or SOD.
However, SOD cooperated with DSF to increase the dead
cell population to about 30% (Figure 4A). Apoptosisassociated PARP cleavage normalized to actin levels was
used to extend the live-dead studies, confirming PARP
fragmentation only in SKBR3 cells exposed to DSF+SOD,
effect inhibited by concomittant TTM addition (Figure 4B)
extending the results shown in Figure 2 for human
melanoma cell lines.

Since both TTM and DSF are copper chelators but
the above results showed that 3 μM TTM protected from
DSF toxicity, we asked whether delayed addition of DSF
or TTM influenced their biological behavior in the absence
of Cu co-administration. When 0.3 μM DSF was added
3 hours prior to addition of a 10 fold TTM molar excess,
attenuation of DSF toxicity by TTM was significantly
diminished and this was partly modified when TTM was
added 4 hours before DSF. However, joint addition of
DSF and TTM completely reverted DSF toxicity, even in
BRAF-mutant A375 cells (Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION
New strategies for selectively killing cancer cells are
required to: a) diminish toxicity against normal tissue; b)
inhibit growth-promoting features preferred by malignant
cells. Increased production of growth-promoting ROS [16,
21, 35] and higher Cu levels [1, 43], frequently seen in
cancer cells relative to normal cells, may be selectively
used to promote tumor cell death [1]. DSF, in ongoing
clinical trials is a copper chelator with preferential toxicity
against cancer cells [3, 37, 39] via ROS overproduction

when co-administered with Cu [24–27, 44]. However,
one of the caveats limiting therapeutic DSF use with Cu
is its significant toxicity against normal tissue [22, 23].
In the gastric tract or in an acidic tumor environment,
DSF is promptly metabolized to DEDTC [28] which also
chelates Cu(II). This DEDTC-Cu complex is more stable
than DSF itself, thereby facilitating anticancer activity.
DSF co-administration with Cu highly increases ROS
partly by the Fenton reaction of Cu with H2O2 generating
the •OH hydroxyl radical [19]. Although physiological
extracellular levels of transition metals like Fe2+ or Cu1+
can catalyze a •OH-generating Fenton reaction outside
the cell, the fact that •OH is about 109 times less stable
compared to H2O2 [44] and its ability to react with
extracellular proteins and lipids [44] or platelets [45],
makes improbable that it will reach sensitive intracellular
tumor targets, unlike the •OH produced in an intracellular
Fenton reaction. Previously, we showed an involvement
of H2O2 in Cu[DEDTC]2 cytotoxicity, since the latter was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

counteracted by exogenous peroxidase activity or thiol
anti-oxidants like NAC [29]. As a follow-up, this report is
the first to show that without Cu overload, exogenous SOD
potentiates sub-toxic DSF increasing cell death in two wt
p53 human melanoma cell lines differing in their V600Emutant BRAF status and in mutant p53 R175H SKBR3
breast carcinoma cells overexpressing the EGFR2/Her2
oncogene. No comparable toxicity was evident when these
agents were used individually. In these studies, exogenous
superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not heat-inactivated SOD
promoted DSF sub-lethal toxicity (not shown), implying
its dismutating activity as an extracellular H2O2 generator.
This potentiation of sub-toxic DSF was also seen with
glucose oxidase, another H2O2 generator [38, 39] and was
prevented by sub-toxic 3 μM of Cu chelators like TTM
or bathocuproine (not shown) or by NAC, a glutathione
(GSH) precursor. Sub-toxic levels of the Cu chelator DSF
or exogenous SOD [35] are likely to cooperate to increase
Cu and H2O2 favouring their participation in an intracellular

Fenton reaction (Figure 5, summary). Physiologically, the
plasma membrane localized NADPH oxidase transfers
electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen to produce
extracellular superoxide anion which can be processed by
SOD to generate extracellular H2O2. At sub-toxic levels,
H2O2 increases ROS which drive the Ras/BRAF/mitogenactivated protein kinase ERK signaling, in which Cu
influx by its hCtr1 transporter is required. In the absence of
physiological Cu, cells may die because MEK activation of
the ERK1/2 survival pathway requires Cu supplementation
[3, 30, 43]. However, cells survive co-treatment of DSF and
exogenous SOD when TTM or the glutathione precursor
NAC are added. A possible reason for the attenuation of
cell death by TTM may be the high depletion of Cu caused
by TTM. This is likely to diminish available Cu [31]
triggering a Cu homeostasis response through activating
the function of the Cu transporter hCtr1 also used by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

platinum [32, 33], to increase Cu or cisplatin transport
into tumor cells. The anti-oxidant NAC also protects from
ROS induction by DSF, up-regulating glutathione, another
inducer of hCtr1 [34]. Facilitation of Cu entry by hCtr1
would reactivate Cu-dependent MEK survival signaling
and cancer cell proliferation [3, 44]. TTM, previously
known as an anti-cancer Cu chelator when used as a single
agent [46] paradoxically also helped revert apoptosisassociated PARP cleavage mediated by DSF and SOD,
implying that basal Cu sequestration by TTM from DSF
diminishes the latter ROS-inducing ability (47), implying
that Cu bound to TTM behaves very differently to Cu
bound to DSF. A recent comparison of Cu chelators TTM
and penicillamine, showed that only the latter increased
available Cu and oxidative stress in mouse brain, while
TTM administration did not lead to comparable results
[48]. Together, these data suggest that the potentiation of

Figure 5: Summary. Toxicity induced by sublethal levels of DSF and low copper is increased by extracellular H2O2
and counteracted by TTM or NAC. In the absence of Cu co-administration, sub-toxic DSF decreases basal Cu and inhibits

Cu-dependent cytosolic SOD1 which cannot generate cytosolic H2O2 [35]. Plasma membrane NADPH oxidase increased in tumor cells
favours extracellular superoxide-mediated H2O2 formation [36] which potentiates sub-toxic DSF-Cu-regulated Fenton-Haber Weiss redox
reactions. Lower catalase in melanoma vs melanocytes [50] and exogenous SOD [35] contribute to preservation of extracellular superoxidemediated H2O2 formation. This H2O2 can enter the cells via aquoporins [14] to inhibit Tyrosine PTPases [35] favouring receptor tyrosine
kinase activation mitogenic signaling. However, the Cu bound to DSF restricts Cu available to activate MEK1, promoting cell death
because Cu and H2O2 driven mitogenic signaling [3] require Cu for -MEK1-driven ERK activation [43] but this Cu is restricted through
chelation by DSF. DSF-Cu toxicity linked to high ROS [44, 47, 53, 54] is inhibited by non-toxic levels of TTM which sequesters Cu from
DSF reverting toxicity and apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione which also chelates
Cu [34], also antagonizes the potentiation of sub-toxic DSF by SOD.

sub-toxic DSF activity against human melanoma and breast
carcinoma cells irrespective of their BRAF or p53 mutant
status and EGFR2/HER2 over-expression, is not merely
related to Cu sequestration or increased Cu uptake by Cu
chelators or ionophores, but rather to the ability of low
DSF levels to increase basal Cu-dependent generation of
ROS through higher intracellular hydroxyl radicals (•OH)
production [19], since it is attenuated by the Cu chelator
TTM or by the anti-oxidant NAC (Summary, Figure 6).
Our findings that increasing H2O2 generation poten­
tiates DSF toxicity is compatible with others indicating that
DSF administration in vivo potentiates hyperoxia-mediated
oxidative toxicity, via conversion to diethyldithiocarbamate
and SOD inhibition [49]. Although it was frequently argued
that DSF toxicity was mostly dependent on a stable DSF
complex with Cu, others recently showed that upon addition
of the Cu (II) ions to the media, the cells are exposed to a
rapid redox decomposition of DSF with a catastrophic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

release of H2O2, implying generation of the latter as crucial
in DSF toxicity [50]. The translational potential of enhancing
DSF toxicity by gradual H2O2 delivery to tumor cells [38, 39]
by small micron-sized glucose oxidase –microspheres as a
source of exogenous ROS [51], but avoiding toxicity from
Cu overload is supported by data showing that melanoma
cells have increased SOD which generates more H2O2
but lower catalase activities, compared to normal human
melanocytes [52]. This study emphasizing the relevance of
exogenous H2O2 generation by exogenous dismutase activity
like that provided by extracellular SOD3 [13] is compatible
with other results showing that loss of SOD3 expression
promotes an invasive phenotype in human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [53].
Significance.- In the absence of Cu co-administration
with DSF which lowers non-specific toxicity [22, 23],
basal Cu in sera is effectively chelated and delivered to
cells by ceruloplasmin. Although the Cu to ceruloplasmin

NOX and ROS activity.

ratio is not significantly altered, Cu and ceruloplasmin
levels are increased significantly in the cancer patients
compared to controls [54]. Since basal Cu [1, 54] and
intrinsic ROS levels [55, 56] are higher in some cancer
cells [30], use of sub-toxic DSF with H2O2 generators
represents a potentially new approach to selectively target
cancer cells, limiting the toxic side effects associated with
Cu overload against normal cells (Summary, Figure 6).
Considering that Her2-overexpressing SKBR3
cells and V600E-BRAF-mutant A375 melanoma cells
respond to sub-toxic DSF and H2O2 generators, it may
be wortwhile to further investigate pre-clinically whether
DSF cooperates to perturb redox homeostasis and attenuate
resistance to targeted therapy with trastuzumab in Her2overexpressing breast cancer [57] or with vemurafenib in
V600E-mutant BRAF melanoma cells [58].
Our rationale for DSF treatment avoiding Cu
overload while augmenting intracellular H2O2 generation,
is to target tumor cell populations with higher ROS and Cu
levels [54, 55]. Basal Cu rather than Cu supplementation
with DSF, is likely to preferentially restrict cancer cell
proliferation and survival, because of their greater copper
requirement [1, 3, 30, 47].

three-dimensional culture [36].
b). A375 melanoma cells are BRAF V600E-mutant
[41]. The BRAFV600E kinase activating mutation is found
in more than 60% of melanomas and promotes MAPK
pathway signaling independent of other mutations [41].
c). SKBR3 human breast carcinoma cells originated
from mammary gland were derived from a metastatic
site. These cells harbour a p53R175H mutation and overexpress the EGF receptor 2/Her2 oncogene [42].
All cells used in this study were maintained in
Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 20 mM glucose,
4 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum unless
otherwise indicated.

Relative cell viability/ metabolic activity
This was estimated with Alamar Blue (resazurin)
obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). It
measures intracellular redox mitochondrial activity
by quantitating the cell-catalyzed conversion of nonfluorescent resazurin to fluorescent resorufin. For these
experiments, cells (6 × 103) were allowed to adhere
overnight in 96 well TC microtiter dishes. After the
corresponding treatments, Alamar Blue was added to 10%
of the cell volume without removing medium containing
poorly adherent or dead cells [42], and fluorescence was
measured 4 h later in a Labsystems Fluoroskan Ascent

microplate reader at an excitation of 544 nm and an
emission of 590 nm [29, 42]. Changes in cell viability
relative to controls was measured after 48–72 hours
treatment, in an end-point fluorometric resazurin reduction
method assay. The results from a representative experiment
are shown, expressed as relative fluorescence ± SD.

Standard deviations (S.D.) were used to determine
a statistically significant difference in the median
values shown for metabolic activity/cell viability and
similar assays. These were repeated at least 2 times.
Generally, S.D. results usually were within ± 5% with a
95% statistical significance. The criterion for statistical
significance was taken as p < 0.05 by Student’ s t test,
whenever indicated by *.

Live-dead assays
Live-dead ratio was determined by adding Calcein
AM and propidium iodide directly to sub-confluent
cultures containing approximately 5–7 × 103 adherent
cells. Calcein acetoxymethyl (AM) is a membranepermeable live-cell labeling dye. Upon entering the cell,
intracellular esterases cleave the AM ester group, yielding
the membrane-impermeable Calcein fluorescent dye,
optimally excited with a 488 nm laser at 495 nm with a
peak emission of 515 nm.. Dead cells with compromised
cell membranes do not retain Calcein but can be identified
by uptake of the non-permeable propidium iodide which
preferentially stains DNA, detected with the same laser
at ≥ 605 nm . Cytofluorometry was used to determine
the relative ratio of live cells with green fluorescence
and dead cells with red fluorescence in an Isocyte laser
spectrofluorometer, without washing away dead cells or
removing the fluorochromes.

Cells were subjected to the treatments indicated in
each case. Subsequently, the unattached dead population
was removed after washing twice in isotonic phosphatebuffered saline. Surviving cells were evidenced following
fixation in 90% ethanol and cell staining with 0.5% crystal
violet in 30% ethanol (both from Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) [41].
