BACKGROUND. The poor prognosis reported for patients with high-grade glial
neoplasms indicates a need for the development of multimodality therapeutic
approaches. The addition of chemotherapy has contributed variably to increased
survival. The objective of the current study (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG]
9016) was to determine whether concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with
the combination of carmustine and cisplatin could be given safely in a cooperative group setting. Additional objectives included the estimation of response rate,
the rate of disease stabilization, and the probability of 1-year survival.

METHODS. SWOG 9016 study included 59 eligible patients with grade III or IV
astrocytoma who received radiotherapy concurrently with carmustine/cisplatin
chemotherapy. Patients were required to have either measurable or evaluable disease. The therapeutic endpoints were comprised of complete response (CR), par-

rimary brain tumors represent approximately 2%
of deaths due to cancer. The majority of tumors
are supratentorial and are comprised of high-grade
gliomas, either anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma (GBM).1,2 The prognosis remains dismal
despite the standard intervention of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. However, in 2 prospective, randomized trials by the Brain Tumor Study
Group (BTSG), the addition of postoperative radiotherapy was found to extend the median survival from
3.5 months to only 9 months.3,4
Attempts to improve the patient outcome have
included the addition of chemotherapy to conventional therapy. Lipid-soluble nitrosoureas, which
cross the blood-brain barrier, are the most commonly used agents. The benefit derived from carmustine and other nitrosoureas has been reported to
be relatively small. Meta-analyses of chemotherapy
trials have demonstrated a small but significant benefit in 1-year survival from adjuvant chemotherapy.5,6
The estimated increase in survival was 10.1% at 1
year and 8.6% at 2 years, with the greatest benefit
occurring in patients with AA.
Chemotherapeutic agents that have demonstrated
promise in in vitro studies have been explored in a
variety of settings.7 Platinum compounds possess several features that predict efficacy against gliomas. Cisplatin crosses the blood-brain barrier and the ratio of
ultrafiltrate platinum in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
to plasma is 0.89.8 After a dose of 100 mg/m2, the
peak CSF level of ultrafiltrate platinum (0.8 lg/mL) is
within the therapeutic range. Furthermore, in vitro
capillary cloning assays confirm that cisplatin has the
least cross-resistance with nitrosoureas.9 Several pilot
studies have validated cisplatin activity in patients
with recurrent gliomas. In 1 study, 4 of 21 patients
(19%) with nitrosourea-refractory high-grade glioma
achieved a partial response (PR) with acceptable toxicity after a dose of 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin administered on Day 1 and Day 8 every 4 weeks.10
Given the lack of overlapping dose-limiting toxicity and minimal cross-resistance, the combination of
cisplatin and carmustine is potentially active in gliomas. This combination has been studied in other
solid tumors, but with myelosuppression as the
dose-limiting toxicity.11
Accordingly, Southwest Oncology Group study
9016 (SWOG 9016) was designed to determine
whether concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy
with the combination of carmustine and cisplatin
could be given safely in a cooperative group setting.
Additional objectives included the estimation of
response rate, the rate of disease stabilization, and
the probability of 1-year survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Requirements included histologically confirmed GBM,
AA, gemistocytic astrocytoma (grade 3), malignant
glioma (not otherwise specified), or grade 3 astrocytoma. Patients with a complete resection or prior
chemotherapy or radiotherapy were ineligible. Other
requirements included a SWOG performance status of
0 to 2, measurable or evaluable disease on imaging
studies, registration within 4 weeks of surgery, adequate renal function (creatinine within institutional
normal limits and creatinine clearance 60mg/
minute), adequate bone marrow reserve (leukocyte
count >4000/mm3 3 109/mm3, a granulocyte count
>1500/mm3, and a platelet count >150,000/mm3),
and normal hepatic function (bilirubin within institutional normal limits, and aspartate aminotransferase
and alkaline phosphatase within twice the upper
limits of normal).
Treatment Protocol
Within 5 days of patient registration, chemotherapy
was initiated with carmustine at a dose of 80 mg/m2
given intravenously over 1 hour on Days 1, 2, and 3,
and cisplatin at a dose of 33 mg/m2 administered over
1 hour on Days 1, 2, and 3 combined with radiotherapy. The maximal cumulative dose of cisplatin has
generally been 400 mg/m2 due to dose-limiting sensory neuropathy. In addition, cumulative carmustine
doses in excess of 1400 mg/m2 are associated with an
increased risk of pulmonary fibrosis and myelodysplasia.12 Therefore, the upper dose limit of carmustine in
this trial was limited to 1440 mg/m2. This treatment
was repeated during Weeks 7, 13, and 19. Patients
received carmustine alone at the same dose on Weeks
25 and 31. Steroids, anticonvulsants, and other standard supportive care agents (including antiemetics and
antibiotics for febrile neutropenia) were continued
during chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was initiated
within 5 days of registration, corresponding to 4 weeks
after surgery. Using opposed lateral or wedged pair
portals covering the entire enhanced tumor (by preoperative computed tomography [CT] scan) plus a 3cm margin, the total dose was 5940 centigrays (cGy)
given in 33 increments at 180 cGy per fraction on a
schedule of 5 days per week. The eyes, nasopharynx,
and cervical regions were shielded, and after 5400 cGy
were received, field reduction excluded the optic
nerves and brainstem.
Criteria for Removal From SWOG 9016
Patients who requested removal or experienced unacceptable toxicity or disease progression after at least
2 courses of carmustine and cisplatin were removed

RT and Cisplatin/Carmustine for Gliomas/Blumenthal et al.

from the protocol. If necessary, those patients who
experienced clinical deterioration before 2 cycles of
chemotherapy were treated with corticosteroids.

Measurement of Response
Patients were required to have either measurable
disease (a bidimensionally measurable lesion with
clearly defined margins and at least 1 dimension
measuring >0.5 cm) or evaluable disease (either unidimensionally measurable lesions or masses with
margins not clearly defined). A complete response
(CR) was defined as the disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease. For patients with measurable disease, a PR was defined as an at least 50%
decrease under baseline in the sum of the products
of the perpendicular dimensions of all measurable
lesions. Disease progression was defined as either
the smaller of a 50% increase in the sum of the products of all measurable lesions or an increase of 10
cm2 or worsening of evaluable disease. Patients who
did not qualify for a CR, PR,, or progressive disease
were defined as having stable disease. Confirmation
of disease status stipulated an assessment being performed 3 to 6 weeks after initial documentation.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical purposes, the primary endpoint of the
current study was toxicity, with patients classified
according to 1) histology, 2) age <40 years versus age
40 to 59 years versus age 60 years, and 3) a SWOG
performance status of 0 to 1 versus 2. A sample size
of 60 patients was selected to capture relatively infrequent toxicities and to provide reasonable accuracy
for the estimation of toxicity and disease stabilization
rates in this phase 2 setting. With 60 patients, any
toxicity that occurred with at least a 5% chance was
likely (probability of at least .95) to be observed, and
the incidence of a particular toxicity or the disease
stabilization rate could be estimated within at least
13% (within 95% confidence).
The design specified that if at any point 3 deaths
due to treatment were observed, the study would be
closed. Alternatively, this regimen was likely (probability of .87) unsuitable if the true probability of toxic
death was .08 and unlikely (probability of .02) toxic if
the probability was .01.
Survival was measured from the day of registration until death from any cause. Time to treatment
failure was measured from date of registration to the
date of disease progression or removal from study
due to toxicity, refusal, or death. The distribution of
survival was estimated by the Kaplan and Meier
method.13

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From July 1991 through May 1992, 74 patients were
entered on the SWOG 9016 study. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients before registration. Of
the 15 ineligible patients, 11 did not have postoperative measurable or evaluable disease, 2 lacked appropriate pathology, 1 was registered >4 weeks after
surgery, and 1 failed to submit baseline information.
Per SWOG policy, ineligible patients were not
included for efficacy analyses or toxicity assessment.
There was 1 major protocol deviation because
the patient did not receive radiotherapy within 1 week
of registration.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table
1. The majority of patients were white, with a median age of 50 years (range, 18-71 years); there was a
slight majority of males. Forty-three patients (73%)
had GBM and 16 patients (27%) had AA.
Response
Of the 59 eligible patients, 6 achieved a CR (CR rate
of 10%; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 4–21%), 4
achieved a PR (PR rate of 7%; 95% CI, 2–16%), and 2
patients (3%) experienced an unconfirmed response.
Twenty-four patients (41%; 95% CI, 28–54%) had
stable disease and 10 patients (18%) demonstrated
progressive disease. The overall disease stabilization
rate (CR 1 PR 1 stable disease, excluding unconfirmed response) was 58% (95% CI, 44–70%). Thirteen
patients had inadequate assessments for response
determination. The overall median time to treatment

failure was 4 months (95% CI, 2–6 months) (Fig. 1)
and was 4 months (95% CI, 2–6 months) for patients
with GBM and 6 months for patients with grade III
astrocytomas (95% CI, 3–74 months) (Fig. 2).

Advanced age was also found to adversely affect
survival time. One-year survival rates for patients
aged <40 years, those ages 40 to 59 years, and
patients aged 60 years were 60% (95% CI, 35–85%),
52% (95% CI, 34–70%), and 27% (95% CI, 4–49%),
respectively (Fig. 5). The 2-year and 5-year overall
survival rates are depicted in Table 2.
The median overall survival for all patients was
10 months (95% CI, 9–16 months).

Survival
The 1-year survival rate for eligible patients with follow-up was 47% (95% CI, 35–60%) (Fig. 3). When survival was evaluated by histology, the 1-year survival
rate for patients with GBM was 44% (95% CI, 29–
59%) and was 56% (95% CI, 32–81%) for patients
with AA (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that the 5year survival rate of patients with AA was nearly 40%,
compared with 7% for patients with GBM. At the
time of last follow-up, 3 patients with AA were alive,
>6 years after study entry. These patients include a
31-year-old woman with a SWOG performance status
of 0 to 1 and a survival time at the time of last
follow-up of 80 months, a 36-year-old man with a
SWOG performance status of 0 to 1 and a survival
time of 118 months, and a 59-year-old woman with a
SWOG performance status of 0 to 1 and a survival
time of 129 months.

Toxicity
In the 59 eligible patients, toxicity was evaluated
according to standard SWOG criteria.14 Approximately 80% of these patients had at least 1 toxicity
that was higher than grade 3. Significant toxicities
(grades 3–5) are summarized on Table 3. The major
toxicity associated with carmustine and cisplatin was
myelosuppression with significant granulocytopenia
and thrombocytopenia (85%). Of the 20 patients who
completed all 6 cycles of chemotherapy, only 1
patient did not require a dose reduction due to myelosuppression. Of the 59 patients studied, 35 (59%)
experienced grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Leuko-

penia was observed in 81% of patients and granulocytopenia was evident in 59% of patients, with 26
patients (44%) exhibiting grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia. Although myelosuppression was relatively severe,
there were only 2 documented infections, neither of
which was life-threatening. Only 1 patient experienced significant hemorrhage related to thrombocytopenia; however, myelosuppression led to significant
dose reductions for patients receiving treatment.
There were no acute treatment-related deaths
reported. After the completion of treatment, 1 ineligible patient died of respiratory complications associated with pulmonary infiltrates believed to be
secondary to treatment. Other significant toxicities
included grade 3 fatigue and lethargy (8 patients)
and grade 4 vomiting requiring hospitalization (2
patients). Grade II or greater neurologic toxicities
reported include visual changes (3 patients), ataxia (1
patient), dizziness (2 patients), hearing (5 patients),
and speech (1 patient). There was only 1 eligible
patient for whom a thromboembolic complication
(phlebitis) was reported.

Treatment Delivery
Myelosuppression often precluded the effective delivery of chemotherapy. Only 1 patient received all 6
cycles of chemotherapy (a 34-year-old with AA). By
the third cycle (Week 13), only 33 patients were still
receiving chemotherapy (therapy was discontinued
in the others either due to disease progression, refusal, or toxicity, most commonly prolonged cytopenia). Of these patients, only 12 were able to receive
full doses of chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy resistance is partially responsible for
the poor outcome of patients with high-grade glioma. Resistance mechanisms are multifactorial,
including poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier, decreased drug uptake resulting in low intracellular concentration, high drug efflux, repair of druginduced damage, and metabolic drug deactivation.15
Despite this well-documented resistance, standard
therapy with adjunct chemotherapy has been re-

564

CANCER

ported to provide only a modest survival benefit.16–19
In a meta-analysis, Stewart documented a 2-month
increase in the median survival when chemotherapy
was combined with radiotherapy.6 Other investigators
have documented that the combination of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) offers patients
with AA a median survival of 39.3 months versus
20.5 months for those receiving carmustine alone.20
However, recent trials have not confirmed a significant advantage of PCV over carmustine alone for either AA21 or GBM.22 Since the SWOG 9016 study
closed, radiotherapy combined with temozolomide
has been established as the standard therapy for
patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The median
survival for patients treated with this regimen is 14.6
months, with a 2-year survival rate of nearly 50% for
patients with MGMT promoter methylation.23,24
The 3 long-term survivors in the current study
were patients with AA. Their survivals were much
longer than even the most favorable (recursive partitioning analysis [RPA] class II) expected median survival for a similar RPA class.25 Although this cohort
was not statistically significant, we can speculate
that certain patients with AA may benefit from current or other adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. In
addition, molecular diagnostic testing of this cohort
might have revealed a profile that was predictive of
longer survival. However, in the current study, tissue
was not available for additional studies. Recent and
ongoing cooperative trials may answer important
questions regarding molecular predictors of treatment response and long-term survival.
Other groups have investigated combined therapy with cisplatin and carmustine.26 The Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) administered
infusional carmustine and cisplatin before radiotherapy.27,28 Of the 50 patients treated, 1 patient achieved
a CR, 10 patients demonstrated a PR, and 18 had
stable disease after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Based
on these results, an ECOG/SWOG intergroup phase 3
protocol (ECOG 2394/SWOG 9508) was proposed for
newly diagnosed GBM patients. A total of 223
patients, 219 of whom were eligible, were randomized to receive infusional cisplatin and carmustine
before radiotherapy or standard radiotherapy with adjuvant carmustine. No difference was observed with
regard to the median survival. Approximately 56% of
patients finished all 3 cycles with serious toxicity, primarily hematologic, and toxicity was reported to
occur more often than in patients who received combined cisplatin and carmustine.28 Another phase 3 cooperative group trial, North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG) 93-72-52/SWOG 9503, compared the
addition of carmustine to cisplatin before and concur-

rent with standard radiotherapy versus accelerated
radiotherapy. The results of this trial of 401 eligible
patients demonstrated no statistical difference
between standard radiotherapy and accelerated radiotherapy. The addition of cisplatin to concurrent carmustine and radiotherapy resulted in increased
toxicity without improved survival.29
In the SWOG 9016 study, the majority of patients
developed a significant hematologic toxicity, although
there were no life-threatening infections or episodes
of life-threatening hemorrhage reported. These
responses were disappointing compared with the single-institution and multicenter experiences that preceded this study. One explanation may be that only
patients with an incomplete surgical resection were
eligible for the current study. Furthermore, hematologic toxicity contributed to decreased dose intensity
and the delivery of carmustine when compared with
standard treatment.
The results of the current study do not support
the additional study or routine use of concurrent cisplatin and carmustine. Our observed median survival
of 10 months is inferior to the estimated survival of a
cohort with a similar tumor grade, patient age, and
performance status as per the RPA classification.25
Nevertheless, efforts continue to evaluate new chemotherapeutic agents and combinations.30,31 Temozolomide in particular has exhibited significant
activity in patients with high-grade glioma.23 The implantation of carmustine wafers followed by radiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed
glioblastoma has also added a small survival advantage over the use of radiation alone.32 Recent
advances in understanding the drug resistance properties of glioma cells may hold the greatest promise
for increasing the survival of these patients.33,34
In the current study, the 1-year survival rate of
44% for patients with GBM and the substantial toxicity reported are simply unacceptable. Compared with
the current standard of radiotherapy and temozolomide, the combination of carmustine and cisplatin is
not recommended for the initial treatment of
patients with high-grade glioma.
