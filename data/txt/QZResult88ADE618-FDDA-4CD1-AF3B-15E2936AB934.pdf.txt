ABSTRACT
Background: The anti-leukemic mechanism of homoharringtonine (HHT) differs
from that of IM, and HHT is one of the most useful agents for use in patients with IM
resistance or intolerance. The Bcl-6/p53 pathway has been shown to regulate the
sensitivity of tumor cells to antitumor drugs. We tested whether HHT blocked the
Bcl-6/p53 pathway in order to promote the apoptosis of IM-resistant cells in vitro
and in vivo.
Results: Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and IM-resistant chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) cells showed high expression of Bcl-6 protein. Bcl-6 mediated
the upregulation of p53, and and Bcl-6 induced growth inhibition of IM-resistant
cells as well as its apoptosis by targeting p53. In addition, Bcl-6 was downregulated
moderately after HHT treatment in different cells. The Bcl-6 expression was
significantly increased in patients with CML when compared with healthy subjects.
Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-6 was higher in patients with CML-blastic phase
(CML-BP) than in those with CML-chronic phase (CML-CP).
Methods: The inhibitory effect of drugs on cell growth was detected by Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), The apoptosis rate and the cell cycle were investigated by
flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-6, p53, Bcl-2, caspase9, and caspase3 proteins
was assayed by western blot, Real- Time PCR (qPCR) detect Bcl-6 and p53 mRNA.
Conclusions: HHT can suppress the growth and induce apoptosis of IM-resistant
cells, the mechanism of which is associated with blocking of the Bcl-6/p53 pathway.
Our results could offer a theoretical explanation for HHT use in patients with IM
resistance or intolerance.

rate of 97% [6], complete cytogenetic response rate of
63% [7], and major cytogenetic response rate of 87%
[8] in newly diagnosed CML-chronic phase (CML-CP)
patients after 12 months of IM treatment. Only 7% of
patients entered accelerated phase (AP) disease or blast
crisis (BC) [9]. Although IM is highly effective for treating
CML, it does have limitations. These include an inability
to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LICs) and the occurrence
of primary or secondary drug resistance [10–12]. IRIS
reported an overall incidence of IM resistance of 18% at
5 years [13]. Compared with CML-CP patients, patients
with progressive disease had higher drug resistance and

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arises from
pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells with a reciprocal
translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [1]. The
chromosomal abnormality persistently activates tyrosine
kinase, resulting in the activation of a downstream
signaling pathway that inhibits cell apoptosis [2–4]. In
2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib
(IM) for CML treatment [5]. The international randomized
study (IRIS) reported a complete hematologic remission

relapse rates. The drug resistance rate was 75% CML-AP
and 95% in CML-BP patients [14]. Recent studies have
reported similar findings [15].
The B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-6) gene encodes a 96
kD nucleophosmin (NPM) that belongs to the bric-abrac tramtrack broad complex/pox virus zinc (BTB/POZ)
transcription factor family [16]. The functional Bcl-6
protein is a transcription repressor containing 706 amino
acids, and the inhibition of Bcl-6 transcription results from
the interaction of BTB/POZ with a number of corepressors
[17, 18]. Bcl-6 is closely associated with the occurrence
and development of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) [19]; 20%–40%
of DLBCL and 15% of FL patients have the Bcl-6 3q27
chromosome translocation [20, 21]. Bcl-6 can suppress
p53 expression in germinal center B-cell like DLBCL and
inhibit B-cell apoptosis caused by DNA damage. Ryan et
al. found that Bcl-6 could downregulate p53 by binding to
its promoter region [22].
The anti-leukemic mechanism of homoharringtonine
(HHT) differs from that of IM, and HHT is one of the
most useful agents for use in patients with IM resistance
or intolerance [23]. HHT is an inhibitor for protein
translation, which blocks the synthesis of protein via
affecting the A site in ribosome [24]. In October 2012, the
US FDA approved the use of HHT for the treatment of
CML, which gave the drug widespread attention [25].
This present study investigated the effect of HHT on
the proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle of IM-resistant
CML cells and involvement of the Bcl-6/p53 signaling
pathway.

0.5 μM IM for 24 h induced more than 50% of K562 cells
to the death (Figure 1A). Treatment with 9.5 μM IM for 24
h induced more than 50% of K562/G01cells to the death
(Figure 1B). Our results show that the drug resistance
of K562/G01 cells is 19 times to the K562 cells, which
proves that our drug resistance cells are effective.

Bcl-6 regulates p53 in K562/G01 cells
In order to observe the influence of Bcl-6 on p53,
we examined Bcl-6 and p53 following treatment of K562/
G01 cells with Bcl-6 siRNA. In cells treated with Bcl-6
siRNA1 and siRNA2 for 48 h, the level of Bcl-6 mRNA
was (30.67±0.82)% and (38.74 ±1.76)%, respectively (P <
0.01; Figure 2A). Furthermore, after Bcl-6 siRNA treatment,
the Bcl-6 protein was obviously reduced (P <0.01; Figure
2B, 2C), which reveals that the downregulation of Bcl6 was effective. Subsequently, p53 mRNA and protein
were detected. The results showed that p53 protein was
upregulated distinctly (Figure 2B, 2C), while the mRNA
was slightly downregulated (Figure 2A). Therefore, Bcl-6
mediated the upregulation of p53 in K562/G01 cells.

K562/G01 cells are sensitive to Bcl-6-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis
After downregulation of Bcl-6, we investigated the
cell growth and apoptosis of K562/G01 cells at 24, 48,
and 72 h. The results showed that downregulation of Bcl6 can inhibit K562/G01 cell growth, in a time-dependent
mode (Figure 3A). The data are shown in Table 1. We
also assessed the effect of Bcl-6 on cell apoptosis. After
48 h, the apoptosis rate was (4.50±0.17)%, (7.23±0.25)%,
(30.9±1.67)%, and (23.26±1.61)%, respectively (Figure
3C, Table 2). Furthermore, we detected the apoptosisrelated proteins. Bcl-2 and total caspase9 were reduced,
and cleaved-caspase3 was upregulated (Figure 3B). In
summary, we suggest that K562/G01 cells are sensitive to
Bcl-6-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.

effects of HHT on cell apoptosis. In K562/G01 cells
cultured with 0, 50, 100, or 200 nM HHT for 24 h,
respectively, the rate of apoptosis was (1.93 ±0.15)%,

respectively (Figure 4C, Table 3). Furthermore, we

mode (Figure 4A). It suggests that HHT could induce

total caspase9 were reduced, and cleaved-caspase3
was upregulated (Figure 4B). We observed that HHT
could induce apoptosis in IM-resistant cells, and that
HHT inhibited the cell cycle progression of K562/G01
cells. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry after treatment with HHT at different doses
and for different time. The cells were treated with 0, 50,
100, or 200 nM HHT for 24 h. The results suggested
that HHT blocks the G1 phase change from the G2
period. The cell number was distinctly decreased after
HHT treatment, when compared with control (P <
0.001; Figure 4D, 4F). The cells were treated with 100
nM HHT for 24, 48, or 72 h. The results suggested that
HHT blocks the G1 phase change from the G2 period,
as shown previously. The cell number was distinctly
decreased after an increased time, when compared with
control (P < 0.001; Figure 4E, 4G).

level of Bcl-6 protein is higher at CML-BP patients than
CML-CP patients.

Bcl-6 protein in Ph+ cells, and HHT blockage of
the Bcl-6/p53 pathway
We tested Bcl-6 protein in K562, K562/G01,
KU812, SUP-B15, and 293T cells after incubation with
HHT at 0, 50 or 100 nM for 24 h. Western blot detect the
expressions of Bcl-6 and p53 proteins. The results showed
that the level of Bcl-6 protein declined in K562/G01 cells,
K562cells, KU812 cells, 293T cells, and SUP-B15 cells,
accompanied by a distinct rise in p53 (Figure 6A–6E).
These results strongly suggest that HHT specifically
reduces Bcl-6 in cells, and its downstream target p53.
To confirm the baseline value of Bcl-6 in CML cells, we
selected five cell lines in which to detect Bcl-6 protein.
The level of Bcl-6 protein, from high to low, was found
to vary in K562/G01 cells, SUP-B15 cells, K562 cells,
KU812 cells, and 293T cells (Figure 6F).

Expression of Bcl-6 in bone marrow
Twenty CML-CP patients and ten CML-BP
patients were the volunteers for samples. Table 4 is the
specific information for patients. The average value of
Bcl-6 mRNA in healthy controls, CML-CP and CMLBP patients was (0.10±0.02), (0.83±0.03), (0.86 ±0.04),
respectively (Figure 5B). Whereas the average value of
Bcl-6 protein in healthy controls, CML-CP and CMLBP patients was (0.17±0.02), (0.57±0.12), (0.91±0.08),
respectively (Figure 5A). The western blot findings are
shown in Figure 5C and 5D. Above data indicates that the

rise in p53 (Figure 7A, 7D). In 293T cells, the amount
of Bcl-6 mRNA reduced in a dose-dependent mode
after treating with HHT, whereas p53 was upregulated
irregularly (Figure 7C). In K562/G01 cells, the Bcl-6
was downregulated compared with control, but there was
a dose-dependent rise in Bcl-6 mRNA, as in K562 cells
(Figure 7B, 7E). The level of p53 changed irregularly
in K562/G01 cells and K562 cells (Figure 7B, 7E). To
confirm the baseline value of Bcl-6 in CML cells, we
selected five cell lines for detection expression of Bcl-6
mRNA. The level of expression of Bcl-6 mRNA, from
high to low, was found to vary in SUP-B15 cells, K562/
G01 cells, K562 cells, KU812 cells, and 293T cells
(Figure 7F).

In 2011, Pellicano F et al described the
pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-6 as a new strategy to
eradicate LICs in CML [26]. Christian et al. reported that
CML cells upregulated Bcl-6 in response to treatment with
a TKI. They also confirmed that Bcl-6 directly repressed
p53 in human CML cells [27]. Duy et al. reported that the
growth of TKI-resistant Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Ph+ ALL) cells was related to Bcl-6 activity and the
pathogenesis of ALL was closely associated with the Bcl6/Arf/p53 pathway signals [28]. We showed that Bcl-6 was
over expressed in K562/G01 cells, which indicates Bcl-6
overexpression is closely linked to TKI resistance in CML.

Bcl-6 plays an important part in the growth and
differentiation of B cells, is associated with pathogenesis
of DLBCL [29], and promotes CML stem cell survival by
inhibiting apoptosis. It has been reported that Bcl-6 can
repress p53-dependent apoptosis because of DNA damage
[30], and that MicroRNA-187 can induce apoptosis of
DLBCL cells by downregulating Bcl-6 expression [31].
Qiang et al. demonstrated the oncogenetic properties of
Bcl-6 in breast cancer, and concluded that Bcl-6 could
be a target in the treatment of breast cancer [32]. In this
study, we showed that low Bcl-6 expression inhibited
growth and apoptosis of IM-resistant K562 cells, and
more importantly, mediated high expression of p53, which
induced apoptosis of tumor cells.
HHT is currently used as an effective treatment
of hematological diseases, especially ALL [33]. We
demonstrated that HHT inhibited growth, caused cell cycle
arrest of IM-resistant K562 cells, and blocked the Bcl-6/
p53 pathway.
Although we know Bcl-6 is associated with IMresistant CML, additional studies are needed to describe
causes. Our research showed that the effects of HHT
on drug resistance involved inhibition of the Bcl-6/p53
pathway.

patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase
(CML-CP, n = 20) and those in blast crisis (CML-BP, n
= 10), we acquired the bone marrow samples. Healthy
control samples were from 11 volunteers without CML.
Mononuclear cells from the samples were isolated by
Ficoll–Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, after that
put in −80°C. The Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical
University approve the research. The IM was obtained
from Selleck and the HHT from MedChem Express
(MCE, Shanghai, China).

Western blot analysis

CCK-8 assay

RIPA lysis buffer was used to isolate proteins
(Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and the Bradford method
determine protein concentrations. Proteins (20 μg) were
divided by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE, Beyotime) and transferred onto PVDF
membranes (Millipore, USA). After 2h blocking in 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA, Vicmed, Xuzhou, China),
the membranes were overnight incubated in primary
antibody, diluted at 4°C in 5% BSA.
The primary antibodies were:anti-Bcl-6 (1:1000,
Abcam, USA), anti-caspase3 (1:1000, Proteintech,
USA), and anti-GAPDH (1:5000, Bioworld), anti-p53
(1:1000, Proteintech), anti-caspase9 (1:1000, Bioworld,
Shanghai, China). Washing, then incubating the
membranes with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)
-conjugated rat anti- rabbit immunoglobulin (1/10000)
(1:5000, Bioworld) for 1 h, diluted in 5% BSA. After
washing, the secondary antibody was visualized by an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Vicmed).

CCK8 (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) analyze the tolerance
IM concentrations in two cells. The two cells were plated
into 96-well plates at 1×104 cells/well in 100 μl agent.
For pre-incubation 24h, IM were added at various doses.
In every test cells treated with the same concentrations of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were contained. Controls are
undisposed cells. Inhibition rate was calculated as [1 – (OD
treated – OD blank)/(OD control – OD blank)] ×100%.

Statistical analysis
SPSS 20.0 statistical software analyzed the
statistical. The mean of three independent tests are
represented by values and values are demonstrated as
mean ±SD. An independent-samples t test was analyzed
the compare of the proliferation and apoptosis of cells
following IM or HHT intervention. A P value <0.05 was
the accepted level for significance.
