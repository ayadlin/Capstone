Abstract
Clinical outcomes of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)–
bearing patients treated with imatinib mesylate (IM) are
variable. Other than the site of mutation within the c-kit gene,
prognostic features of GIST remain undefined. IM can exhibit
off-target effects such as triggering natural killer (NK) cell
activity. We addressed whether NK cell functions could predict
long term survival with IM. NK cell functions were followed up
in 77 GIST patients enrolled onto two phase III trials.
‘‘Immunologic responders’’ were defined as patients whose
NK cell IFN-; values after 2 months of IM were higher than or
equal to the baseline value at entry into the trial. The
prognostic effect of IFN-; on progression-free survival was
assessed by a Wald test in a Cox regression analysis using the
landmark method and stratified by trial and on the c-kit
mutational status. Fifty-six patients were evaluable for the NK
cell IFN-; responses at baseline and 2 months. Their median
follow-up for progression-free survival was 3.7 years. Thirtyfour of 56 patients were immunologic responders to IM. In the
Cox regression analysis, immunologic responders possessed a
hazard ratio of progression or death equal to 0.29 (95%
confidence interval, 0.12–0.70; P = 0.006) compared with
nonresponders. Kaplan-Meier 2-year survival estimates were
85% for immunologic responders and 50% for nonresponders.
Moreover, the immunologic response added prognostic value
to the c-kit mutation. The NK cell IFN-; production after 2
months of treatment could be considered an independent
predictor of long term survival in advanced GISTs treated with
IM. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3563–9]

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common
mesenchymal tumors in the human digestive tract (1). Their
molecular etiology has recently been unraveled and led to the
paradigmatic use of specific therapies. Indeed, the sequencing of
c-kit complementary DNA, which encodes a proto-oncogenic
receptor tyrosine kinase (2) from GIST-bearing patients, revealed
mutations in the region between the transmembrane and tyrosine

kinase domains (2). All of the corresponding mutant KIT proteins
were constitutively activated without the KIT ligand, stem cell
factor. It was then postulated that GIST could originate from the
interstitial cells of Cajal because the development of interstitial
cells of Cajals is dependent on the stem cell factor-KIT interaction
and because, such as GIST, these cells express both KIT and CD34.
Somatic gain-of-function mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogene are
found in 85% of GIST and mutations of the platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR)a chain were reported in 35% of the GISTs
lacking the KIT mutations (3).
The 2-phenylaminopyrimidine compound STI571 [imatinib
mesylate (IM); Gleevec; Novartis] has been initially designed to
specifically block the ATP-binding site of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase
and found to inhibit the kinase activity of three kinases ABL,
PDGFRa, and KIT (4–6). IM selectively inhibits c-kit tyrosine kinase
activity and downstream activation of target proteins involved in
cellular proliferation and survival. IM enables disease control
including objective responses and stable diseases in >80% of GIST
patients (7). Therefore, IM became the standard treatment of
advanced GISTs. The questions as to the optimal dosing and
duration of IM were then addressed in phase III trials. The
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) study (8) aimed at assessing dose dependency of response
and progression-free survival (PFS) with IM concluded that a daily
dose of 400 mg of IM should be recommended in the management
of metastatic GIST patients. The French Sarcoma Group addressed
in a prospective, randomized, multicentric phase III study (BFR14
trial) the duration of IM therapy and concluded that IM should be
continued unless overt progression occurs (9).
Importantly, the mutational status of the KIT oncoproteins
represents the most valuable predictive factor of clinical response
to imatinib to date (3). Hence, patients whose tumors contained
exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer survival than those whose
tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable
kinase mutation. However, unexpected long-term responses to IM
have been reported in GIST lacking the hallmark criteria of
responses to such a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Le Cesne A.
et al., abstract 10005 American Society of Clinical Oncology 2007).
In the search for additional prognostic factors, we addressed
whether IM could exhibit functional side effects on KIT expressing
the targets of the host. Indeed, tumor cell progression not only
depends on cell autonomous tumor suppressive pathways but also
on extrinsic immunologic barriers (10). Indeed, we highlighted an
alternate mode of action of IM that is not tumor cell autonomous
and involves—at least—host bone marrow–derived dendritic cells

(DC). We unraveled the natural killer (NK) cell–dependent
antitumor effects promoted by IM-treated DC in mouse tumor
models resistant to the IM antiproliferative effects in vitro (11).
These findings suggested the relevance of IM-mediated NK cell
activation in patients bearing GIST devoid of KIT/PDGFRa
mutations and displaying clinical responses to IM (11). It is
noteworthy that IM-treated human DC were also endowed with NK
cell stimulatory capacities in vitro (11). Because GIST tumor cells
exhibit molecular features of NK cell sensitivity (11) such as loss of
MHC class I molecules and expression of NKG2D ligands, we now
address the role of the innate immune rsesponses in the response
to IM and long-term survival in GIST patients followed up in the
EORTC and BFR14 trials. Here, we show that IM does modulate
NK cell responses in patients and propose an in vitro NK cell
assay that could predict, at 2 months, the long-term response to
IM independently of the exon 11 c-kit mutation. This finding
may effect the current clinical management of GIST patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients and trials. The immunomonitoring studies of NK cell
responses examined 34 GIST patients enrolled onto the EORTC phase III
trial 62005 (8) and 43 GIST patients included in the French Sarcoma Group
phase III clinical trial (BFR14; ref. 9), assessing dose and duration of IM,
respectively. An informed written consent was obtained from patients
according to the local ethical committee for the clinical and the
immunologic studies. Heparinized blood was drawn from patients before
treatment and after 2, 6, 12 mo of IM therapy. Characteristics of patients are
depicted in Table 1. Tumor response was assessed by computed
tomography scan, and the response was classified according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria every 3 mo after
the beginning of treatment. Nonprogressive disease encompassed stable
disease and partial or complete responses. About 18 healthy volunteers

(sex- and age-matched with GIST patients) were used as controls for the
immunologic parameters.

Flow Cytometry Analyses
Peripheral blood was stained with the following antibodies: CD45-FITC
(clone HI30), CD3-APC (clone UCHT) purchased from BD Pharmingen;
NKp30-PE (clone Z25), NKp46-PE (clone BAB281), CD56-PC5 (clone N901),
from Beckman-Coulter; and NKG2D PE (clone 149810) from R&D Systems.
Fluorescence was acquired on a FACScalibur cytometer and subsequently
analyzed with the CellQuest Pro software. In NKp30 cross-linking experiments, NK cells were incubated for 7 h with 2 AL of anti–CD107a-PE (clone
H4A3; Pharmingen) in AIMV supplemented with 10 Amol/L monensin, and
CD3/CD56 staining was performed after the cross-linking.

Assessment of In vitro NK Cell Effector Functions
Preparation of allogeneic monocyte-derived DC. Allogeneic monocyte-derived DCs were used for coculture with purified patients’ NK cells.
These DC were propagated from monocytes of normal volunteers harvested
from leukapheresis as previously described (11). After 5 d, immature DC
were frozen and one vial was subsequently thawed for each experiment.
Isolation and activation of peripheral NK cells. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of GIST patients and NV were obtained by FicollHypaque (Amersham Pharmacia) density cushion centrifugation. For NKp30
cross-linking experiments, NK cells were purified (purity, >95%) with the
human NK cells Easy Sep kit (Stem Cell Technologies) and seeded (105 NK
per well) in 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) coated with 2.5 Ag/mL of mouse
IgG2a anti-NKp30 (clone 210847; R&D Systems) or isotype control for 7 h.
For the DC/NK cocultures, NK cells were purified with the Human NK cell
Rosette Sep kit (Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated for 44 h with freshly
thawed immature monocyte-derived DC. Maturation of DC was achieved by
adding lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich) in DC/NK cocultures at a final
concentration of 5 Ag/mL. Otherwise, NK cells were activated with 1,000 IU
of rIL-2 (Chiron) for 44 h.
Cytokine quantification. After a 44-h DC/NK coculture or interleukin
(IL)-2 stimulation, supernatants of NK cells were assessed for their IFN-g
levels using commercial ELISA kits (BD Biosciences/Pharmingen).
Cytotoxicity assays. Purified NK cells were used as effector cells in a
standard 4 h chromium release assay against the Na51
2 CrO4–labeled (PerkinElmer France) erythroleukemia K562. Experiments were conducted in
triplicated wells at various effector/target ratios (10:1, 2:1, and 0.4:1).

Statistical Analyses
The Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney test were used for comparison of
the different groups of in vitro assays. For three or more groups, the one way
ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis tests were performed as appropriate, followed by
Bonferroni or Dunn posttests, respectively. The prognostic effect of IFN-g
‘‘immunologic responses’’ after 2 mo on PFS was assessed by a Wald test in a
Cox regression analysis using the landmark method (12) and stratified by
trial (i.e., BFR14 versus EORTC) and by c-kit mutational status. Thus, PFS
was defined as the time from 2 mo after IM initiation to the date of
progression or death, and censored at the date of last follow-up for those
without events. The median follow-up was calculated using the inverted
Kaplan-Meier method. A two-sided P value of 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
Impaired NKp30 functions in GIST patients. Flow cytometry
analyses of peripheral blood NK cells revealed a profound downregulation of the surface expression of the natural cytotoxicity
receptor NKp30 (Fig. 1A) and to a minor extent of the alternate
natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46 (data not shown) in GIST
patients at initiation of IM therapy compared with normal
volunteers. Although found in other tumor models, the downregulation of NKp30 expression was very severe (<25%) in 30% of
GIST cases (Fig. 1A). The function of NKp30 was assessed by crosslinking the receptor for 7 h with anti-NKp30 monoclonal antibody

NK Cell Activation Correlates with GIST Prognosis

Figure 1. Modulations of NKp30 and NKG2D-related functions during IM therapy. NK cells from GIST (before and during therapy indicated in mo), or cancer patients or
NV were analyzed by flow cytometry for their expression of NKp30 (A and C ) or NKG2D (D). Each dot represents one individual. Cytotoxic activity of NK cells

in vitro and by measuring the exocytosis of lytic granules using
anti-CD107a monoclonal antibody. Membrane expression of
CD107a was significantly reduced in GIST patients at diagnosis
compared with NV (Fig. 1B). Although the expression levels of
NKp30 significantly increased at late time points of IM therapy
(Fig. 1C), the NKp30-dependent lytic potential was restored at early
time points (Fig. 1B). Therefore, GIST patients exhibit profound but
transient defects in NKp30 functions during IM therapy.
GIST patients display enhanced NKG2D functions. In
contrast to NKp30, the lectin-like NK receptor NKG2D was
normally expressed on circulating NK cells in GIST patients at
diagnosis (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the NKG2D-dependent cytolysis of
the erythroleukemia K562 was in reference ranges in GIST patients
at presentation compared with NV (Fig. 1E). The dynamics of
NKG2D-mediated functions was assessed at various time points
during IM therapy for at least 1year. The spontaneous NK cell lysis
against K652 augmented significantly by 1 year of IM therapy
(Fig. 1E). Therefore, NK cells from GIST patients exhibit potent
spontaneous and IM-induced NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity.
Enhanced IFN-; secretion after IL-2 and DC stimulation in
GIST. Next, we assessed the capacity of NK cells from normal
volunteers versus GIST patients to respond to two stimuli, IL-2
(Fig. 2) or maturing DC (mDC; Fig. 3). Production of IFN-g by NK
cells is mostly governed by IL-12 and to a minor extent by IL-2 (13).
The main physiologic source of IL-12 is the mDCs. Moreover, we
previously reported that the DC-mediated NK cell triggering for
IFN-g production was dependent on prestored granules of IL-12
delivered into the DC/NK cell synapse in murine and human
cocultures in vitro (13). Therefore, we monitored the secretions of
IFN-g by NK cells after in vitro restimulation with the gold

standard recombinant IL-2 (Fig. 2) or alternatively with mDC
(to assess responsiveness to IL-12; Fig. 3). We used this in vitro
coculture system (allogeneic DC together with GIST patients NK
cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide) to monitor the response
of circulating NK cells to IL-12 secreted from mDC. Surprisingly, NK
cells from GIST patients before IM treatment markedly responded
to IL-2 (Fig. 2A) and mDC (Fig. 3A) compared with NV. Interestingly,
IM rapidly augmented—by 2 months—the responsiveness to
exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 2A) and mDC (Fig. 3A) in vitro.
Therefore, NK cells from GIST patients exhibited potent
spontaneous and IM-induced IFN-g secretion after ex vivo
restimulation with IL-2 or mDC.
Clinical effect of IM-induced NK cell functions. The
monitoring of NK cell functions during IM therapy revealed the
potential relevance of three immunologic parameters.
The first criterion was the capacity of IM to boost the NKG2Ddependent lysis at 12 months. The time to progression was not
significantly ameliorated in GIST exhibiting IM-induced enhanced
killing functions versus the other GIST (data not shown).
The second criterion was the capacity of IM to boost the IL-2–
dependent IFN-g production at 2 months, which could be assessed
for 38 patients. Two cohorts of GIST patients could be readily
distinguished, i.e., those for whom the IL-2–induced IFN-g
production was equal or higher at 2 months compared with
baseline (Fig. 2B, right) versus those for whom NK cells failed to
respond to IL-2 (Fig. 2B, left). We studied the time to progression
of these 38 patients that benefited from a median follow-up of
40 months in both cohorts of GIST (Fig. 2B). The time to
progression was not statistically longer in patients with enhanced
IL-2–induced IFN-g production (Fig. 2C; log-rank test, P = 0.19).

The third criterion was the capacity of IM to boost the mDCdependent IFN-g production. Fifty-six patients were evaluable for
the NK IFN-g responses at 0 versus 2 months (43 patients in
BFR14, 13 patients from EORTC trial). Their median follow-up for
PFS was 3.7 years, and 36 of 56 patients had progressed during
follow-up. ‘‘Immunologic responders’’ were defined as patients
whose NK cell IFN-g values were higher or equal to the baseline
value at entry in the trial. Thirty-four of 56 were found to be
immunologic responders (Fig. 3B, right). The 11 ‘‘nonimmunologic
responders’’ were defined as patients whose IFN-g values had
decreased after 2 months compared with the baseline value
(Fig. 3B, left). The prognostic effect of immunologic responses
(based on NK cell IFN-g production after mDC stimulation) at
2 months of IM on PFS was assessed by a Wald test in a Cox
regression analysis using the landmark method and stratified by
trial (i.e., BFR14 versus EORTC). In the Cox regression analysis
stratified by trial, the immunologic responders possessed a hazard
ratio of progression or death equal to 0.29 (95% confidence
interval, 0.12–0.70; P = 0.006) compared with non immunologic
responders. Kaplan-Meier 2-year survival estimates were 85%
(95% confidence interval, 73–97%) for immunologic responders

and 50% (95% confidence interval, 29–71%) for non immunologic
responders (Fig. 3C).
From these 56 patients, 38 patients have been evaluated for c-kit
mutation status (14) at exon 11, which predicted the response to
IM (3). Twenty nine patients exhibited a tumor presenting with an
exon 11 mutation, whereas 9 harbored a tumor lacking an exon 11
mutation (‘‘nonexon 11’’). In a Cox regression analysis stratified by
trial, the nonexon 11 tumor-bearing patients had significantly
poorer PFS compared with the exon 11 c-kit–mutated tumorbearing patients [hazard ratio of progression or death equal to 0.32
(95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.98; P = 0.046)]. Two-year survival
estimates were 56% (95% confidence interval, 23–88%) for nonexon
11 tumor–bearing patients and 86% for exon 11 c-kit–mutated
tumor–bearing patients (95% confidence interaval, 73–99%).
To assess whether NK cell IFNg production after stimulation
with mDC at the host level added a prognostic value to the ckit
mutation status of the tumor, we analyzed ckit mutation status as a
stratification factor in the Cox regression model together with the
trial. Immunologic responders still presented a hazard ratio of
progression or death equal to 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.28–
0.87; P = 0.03) compared with nonimmunologic responders.

regression analysis stratified by trial compared the time to progression or death in
immunologic responders (defined in B) versus nonimmunologic responders.

We confirmed this original finding by adding 21 additional
patients for whom the value of NK cell IFN-g production after
stimulation with mDC was only available at 2 months (but was
missing at baseline before IM therapy). To classify these latter
cohort into immunologic versus nonimmunologic responders, we

set up a cutoff value at 0.7 ng/mL because 95% of normal
volunteers produced <0.7 ng/mL of IFN-g (Fig. 3)?. Therefore, 77
GIST (the first 56 and the additional 21 cases) could be segregated
into immunologic versus nonimmunologic responders (Table 2).
Moreover, 4 prognostic factors predicting late resistance have been

reported (15), namely large tumor size (>12 cm), high baseline
blood granulocyte count at entry (>5.109/L), low dosing of IM
(400 mg daily), and extragastric location of the primary tumor. In a
multivariate analysis using Cox model, the immunologic response
to mDC was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS
(hazard ratio, 0.339; P = 0.003), whereas c-kit mutation status,
diameter of the largest lesion, granulocyte count, IM dosing, and
primary tumor site were not retained by the model (Table 2). These
results indicate that the innate immune response is a major and
independent predictor for PFS in patients with advanced GIST
receiving IM.

Discussion
We aimed at investigating the predictive role of host-derived
parameters namely NK cell effector functions in the long-term
survival mediated by IM therapy in 77 GISTs. The 1-year
immunomonitoring follow up of NK cell effector functions in 2
phase III trials revealed the enhancement of the NKG2D-dependent
cytotoxicity and IL-2/IL-12–dependent IFN-g production. However,
enhanced NKG2D-dependent lysis observed at 1 year of IM therapy
did not effect on survival (data not shown). Although the late
immunologic events might just be a consequence of tumor
regression, the early modulations of innate immune responses are
of utmost importance in that they could allow to select patients
benefiting from continuous IM therapy or, conversely, to redirect
patients toward alternative therapeutic options. Interestingly, we
found that the immunologic response defined as the IM-induced
IFN-g secretion after ex vivo stimulation by mDC is a valuable
predictive and independent indicator of long-term survival (Fig. 3C).
Cancer is widely considered to be a cell-autonomous genetic
disease that results from alterations in oncogenes, tumorsuppressor, and genome stability genes. However, cancer is also a
disease in which the tumor cell microenvironment, the stroma,
and immunity play a major role. Indeed, for the development of
full-blown neoplasia, cancer cells have to overcome intrinsic
(cell-autonomous) as well as extrinsic (immune-mediated) barriers
to oncogenesis (10). NK cells have been recently involved in the
host-mediated control of cancer (16–19). The renaissance of NK
cells in tumor immunosurveillance can be attributed to the
discovery of stress-induced ligands for NK cell–activating receptors
(20) and the relevance of MHC class I/Killer Inhibitory Receptor
interactions in mismatched hematopoietic transplants causing NK
cell–mediated graft versus leukemia effects (16). In acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), impaired NKp30-mediated NK cell lysis has been
associated with early relapse (21). However, in contrast to AML,
GIST tumor cells did not seem to be recognized in a NKp30dependent manner but rather through NKG2D receptor (11).9
Surprisingly, our data reveal that NKG2D-dependent functions
are not critical for the 5-year event-free survival (data not shown),
suggesting that the role of NK cells might not be at the effector
phase of the immune responses but rather at the regulatory phase,
in the lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes contain several subsets of DCs that are critical
links between innate and cognate immune responses (22). The DC/
NK cell cross-talk has been recently involved in the host-mediated
control of cancer (17, 19). The capacity of NK cells to control DC
maturation or killing is a cornerstone regulatory event for cognate
immune responses (23, 24). The NK-mediated DC activation is

mediated through IFN-g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a in vitro
(25). How IM is operating remains speculative. Our unpublished
data do not support the fact that IM acts on GIST cells (a GIST cell
line exhibiting an exon 13 c-kit mutation) to sensitize NK cell
attack. We have reported that IM acts on the c-kit signaling
pathway of mouse myeloid DC subsets to promote NK cell IFN-g
secretion and cytotoxicity (11). This DC-mediated NK cell
triggering might occur in lymph nodes (rather than tumor; beds
refs. 26, 27) and lead to the exit of NK cells from lymph nodes and
recirculation in the blood (compartment where we performed our
immunomonitoring studies). Supporting this hypothesis, our
results indicate that mDC-dependent IFN-g production by NK
cells is higher after IM therapy and dictates the clinical outcome
under IM. mDC can indeed form active immunologic synapses with
resting or preactivated NK cells through a mechanism involving
cytokines and cell to cell contacts (13, 28). It is conceivable that in
addition to IM, other pathophysiologic conditions might deliver
TLR4 ligands (such as HMGB1; ref. 29) in tumor-draining lymph
nodes that could recapitulate such a productive DC/NK cell crosstalk. Moreover, our unpublished data favor the hypothesis whereby
IFN-g and TNF-a, resulting from the IM-induced DC/NK cell cross
talk, act in concert to block the proliferation of GIST cells. It is also
conceivable that IFN-g and IM might operate together against
GIST neoangiogenesis, as suggested by previous reports (5, 30).
For historical reasons, drug discovery programs for cancer
therapy have neglected the possibility that immune reactivity
might contribute to the efficacy of treatment (31, 32). Although
cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often viewed as a
strategy that mainly affects tumor cells, accumulating evidence
indicates that, depending on the lethal stimulus, tumor cell death
can elicit a specific immune response that contributes to the
therapeutic effect (29, 33, 34). Other drugs may have side effects
that stimulate the immune system, by transient lymphodepletion
(7), by the subversion of immunosuppressive mechanisms (33, 35),
or by direct or indirect stimulatory effects on immune effectors
(36, 37). Moreover, vaccination against cancer-specific antigens
can sensitize the tumor against subsequent chemotherapeutic
treatment (38–43). Our data bring up the first evidence of (a) a
host-derived factor in dictating GIST outcome during IM therapy
(3, 44, 45), of (b) a prognostic effect of NK cell functions in solid
tumors, and of (c) an immunologic ‘‘off-target’’ effect on NK cells of
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A larger patient series will be needed to
validate the prognostic value of an augmented NK cell IFN-g
production at 2 months of IM therapy and to establish the added
value of this immunologic parameter over that of the c-kit
mutation status or ultrasonography (46).
