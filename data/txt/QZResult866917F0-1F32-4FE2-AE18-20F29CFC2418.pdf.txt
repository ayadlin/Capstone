Abstract
pRb and p53 are the two major tumor suppressors. Their inactivation is frequent when cancers
develop and their reactivation is rationale of most cancer therapeutics. When pRb and p53 are
genetically inactivated, cells irreparably lose the antitumor mechanisms afforded by them. Cancer
genome studies document recurrent genetic inactivation of RB1 and TP53, and the inactivation
becomes more frequent in more advanced cancers. These findings may explain why more
advanced cancers are more likely to resist current therapies. Finding successful treatments for
more advanced and multi-therapy resistant cancers will depend on finding antitumor mechanisms
that remain effective when pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated. Here, we review studies that
have begun to make progress in this direction.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Tumorigenesis is genetic and epigenetic evolution to survive and expand when cells acquire
tumorigenic mutations. Since our cells have built in tumor suppressing safeguards,
tumorigenesis is fundamentally a process of disarming the safeguards. Once a tumor has
formed and therapies begin, tumor cells additionally evolve to resist therapies. We will
display roles of pRb and p53 in a condensed tumorigenic and tumor suppressive network,
and sample a few cancer genome studies for the genetic status of RB1 and TP53 to assess the
challenges from cancers with genetically inactivated pRb and p53. We will then discuss
publications that have identified mechanisms to block Rb1 (mouse homolog of RB1)
knockout (KO), Trp53 (mouse homolog of TP53) KO, or Rb1 and Trp53 doubly knockout
(DKO) autochthonous tumors in mouse models. We include studies using xenograft models
of human cancer that allow definitive attribution of observed effects to pRb or p53 genetic
inactivation. These studies provide insights to the extent of mechanistic, functional, and
physiological rigor not feasible with clinical studies. We conclude with a perspective for

The pRb tumor suppressor safeguard
pRb responds to proliferation signals in the p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-pRb pathway

Author Manuscript

As shown in Figure 1, typical growth factors (GFs) ligate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
to activate Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk and Ras-PI3K-Akt pathways. Since PI3K is also directly
activated by RTKs and significantly inhibited by Pten, we will call the latter PI3K(Pten)Akt. Erk phosphorylates transcription factors, such as Fos, to activate expression of cyclin
D1 to phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, or Ets1, to activate expression of p16 (also called
p16INK4a) to inhibit cyclin D1/Cdk4 when signaling is aberrant. In the p16-Luc reporter
mice, p16 was activated in all 14 tested tumor models (1). A recent study achieved more
effective inhibition of PI3K activated breast cancer xenografts when PI3K inhibitors were
combined with cyclin D1/Cdk4 inhibitors (2). Overall, pRb is likely activated by most
oncogenic signals and subsequently inactivated during tumor progression.
pRb is best equipped to implement proliferation arrest
pRb binds E2F to bring histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, chromatin remodeling
proteins, Polycomb-group proteins, and DNA methyltransferases to the promoters of E2F
target genes (3, 4). With these mechanisms, pRb can create local heterochromatic state,
sometimes microscopically visible as senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF)
(5), to permanently repress expression of DNA synthesis proteins to implement the
senescence safeguard.

Author Manuscript

E2F1 is both proliferative and apoptotic
Then, how could inactivation of pRb benefit tumorigenesis? Following DNA damage, pRb
binds more E2F1 on E2F target promoters and brings histone acetylase P/CAF to stimulate
expression of apoptotic target genes caspase-7 and p73 but brings histone deacetylase
HDAC1 to repress proliferative target gene cyclin A2. Loss of pRb therefore reduced
apoptosis in colon epithelium following i.p. injection of doxorubicin (6). In other studies,
E2F1 distinguished itself from other E2Fs by forming an additional binding to pRb (7);
E2F1’s apoptotic target genes distinguished themselves from proliferative target genes by
recruiting FoxO1 and 3 to their promoters (8). Whether pRb uses these mechanisms to
activate apoptotic target genes of E2F1 to suppress tumorigenesis requires further study.
Other studies attempted to use E2F1’s apoptotic activity to treat pRb deficient tumors (see
below).

pRb represses E2F to suppress cancer cell metabolism
Cancer cells need more free energy to divide and more nucleotides, amino acids, and fatty
acids to build new cells. Since a more active metabolism generates more ROS and
biosynthesis consumes reductants, cancer cells also rely on stronger supplies of reductive
equivalents. As summarized in Figure 2, cancer cells take up more glucose and glutamine
and use them to generate more ATP, carbon backbones (light reds), and reductants (greens).

In pRb ChIP experiments with Drosophila third instar larvae (9), genes involved in DNA
replication ranked first in numbers as pRb target genes (10). Ranked second were genes
involved in pyrimidine metabolism, revealing that pRb coordinates repressing DNA
synthesis with reducing nucleotides synthesis. In glycolysis, pyruvate can be converted to
acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) for oxidative phosphorylation in
mitochondria, or to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is a major feature of
cancer cell metabolism. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylates and
inactivates PDH; the isoenzyme PDK4 is an E2F1 target gene (11). On the glutamine side,
the glutamine transporter ASCT2 is an E2F3 target gene (12). These and other findings
suggest that pRb can suppress cancer cell metabolism (13, 14).

The p53 tumor suppressor safeguard: it has become complicated
Author Manuscript

Classically, p53 safeguard works like this: DNA damage leads to p53 activation and p53
executes apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. As a DNA-binding transcription factor, p53 activates
expression of CDKI p21 to arrest cell cycle; and proapoptotic protein Bax, and BH3-only
proteins PUMA and NOXA to induce apoptosis. The repressor E2F, E2F7, is a new p53
target gene for cell cycle arrest (15, 16).

Unexpectedly, γ-radiation induced similar tumorigenesis in mice whether or not p53 was
present to respond with apoptosis; only after apoptosis subsided, presence of p53 delayed
tumorigenesis (17). Oncogenic signaling, but not simple DNA damage, activates Arf (also
called p14Arf in humans and p19Arf in mice), which in turn activates p53 in the Arf-MDM2p53 pathway (17, 18) (Figure 1). Furthermore, while ectopic expression of HRASG112V in
MEFs activated Arf-p53 to induce senescence, expression of endogenous KRASG12D
stimulated proliferation (19). In the lung, expression of endogenous KRASG12D induced
tumors because it did not activate Arf as monitored by the Arf-GFP reporter mice (20, 21).
However, KRASG12D strongly activated Arf in the leg muscle and tumorigenesis was
therefore blocked (21). Endogenous expression of a different KRAS mutant, KRASG12V,
also did not induce Arf-p53 in MEF (22), but induced senescent lesions in the lung and
pancreas (23). Tetracycline titrated expression of HRASG12V in mammary glands
demonstrated the entire process of tumorigenesis in three steps: initial expression of
HRASG12V induced neoplastic lesions, gradually increased expression of HRASG12V
triggered Arf-p53 to induce senescence safeguard, and abrogation of this safeguard led to
tumorigenesis (24). Dosage dependent activation of Arf-p53 was also observed with graded
expression of Myc (25, 26). Thus, activation of Arf depends on oncogenic strength and
context. Importantly, when tumors were induced by endogenous KRASG12D in the absence
of Arf-p53 activation, restoring p53 induced only mild proliferation inhibition and apoptosis
and only in areas of advanced tumor histopathology. In other areas, restored p53 was not
activated (27, 28). In contrast, tumors induced by irradiation of newborns (29), viral
expression of HRASG12V (30), or Eμ-Myc (31) in the absence of p53 strongly activated
restored p53 leading to complete tumor regression. These findings could explain why p53 is
more frequently inactivated in more advanced cancer. It will be important to use the p16Luc mice (1) to learn how p16-pRb responds to differing strengths of oncogenic signals.

The mechanisms by which p53 suppresses tumorigenesis has also become complicated when
Li et al generated K-to-R knockin mice to prevent acetylation of K117, K161, and K162
(32). p533KR/3KR MEFs were unable to express p21, PUMA, or NOXA and unable to cell
cycle arrest, senesce, or apoptose following DNA damage. p533KR/3KR mice however were
still protected from tumorigenesis. From another direction, combined knockout of p21,
PUMA, and NOXA disabled proliferation arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in MEFs, but the
mice were no more tumor prone than WT mice (33). Thus, the ability of p53 to induce cell
cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis is dispensable for its tumor suppressor role, leaving
us to wonder how p53 suppresses tumorigenesis. Since mutations that completely abolished
transcription activity of p53 nullified its tumor suppressor role, p53 likely functions as a
transcription factor to suppress tumorigenesis (34). Indeed, p533KR/3KR MEFs can activate
expression of TIGAR and GLS2, suggesting that p533KR/3KR may suppress cancer cell
metabolism (32) (Figure 2 and see more below). It would be more informative to determine
whether p533KR/3KR can activate expression of E2F7 (see above), miR-200c (which
suppress EMT (35, 36)), miR-34 (which suppress Snail (37) and stem cell marker CD44
(38)), or can repress expression of CD44 (39), or miR-17~92 (40). p53 also represses
hundreds of genes through activating expression of lincRNA-p21 (41).

p53 coordinates inhibition of cell proliferation and growth (42)

Author Manuscript

PI3K(Pten)-Akt is a major pathway for growth regulation. Through activating mTORC1,
PI3K(Pten)-Akt enhances translation of p53 mRNA to induce senescence independent of
Arf (43, 44) (Figure 4a). Reciprocally, p53 negatively regulates cell growth by activating
expression of Pten, TSC2, and AMPKβ (45, 46). p53 activates expression of sestrin 1 and 2,
which form AMPK-sestrins-TSC2 complex to stimulate AMPK to phosphorylate and
activate TSC2 (47). The significance of sestrin and p53 in growth suppression was
demonstrable in the liver of sestrin or p53 KO mice following DEN treatment (47).
Interestingly, these reciprocal relationships may become synthetic lethal in certain contexts
(see below, Figure 4b, c).

Cancer genome studies reveal recurrent genetic inactivation of pRb and
p53

Author Manuscript

Cancer genome studies have employed large-size collections of primary tumors for multiplatform genome scale characterization. In Figure 3A, we analyzed 125 high-grade bladder
carcinomas that yielded gene copy number variations, exome sequencing, and RNA Seq
data (48) for components of the p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-pRb and Arf-MDM2-p53 pathways.
Deletion of the CDKN2A locus led to loss of both p16 and Arf. The nearby CDKN2B
(encoding p16 family member p15) is generally deleted together. Cyclin D1 and MDM2 are
frequently upregulated by gene amplification or overexpression. pRb and p53 are inactivated
by cyclin D1/Cdk4 and MDM2/4 at frequencies of 56% and 34%, respectively. Genetically,
pRb and p53 is inactivated at 22% and 54%, respectively, with inactivation of both RB1 and
TP53 occurred at 15%.
In Figure 3B, we analyzed data from two prostate cancer studies to assess how the
frequencies changed with cancer progression. Taylor et al (49) studied 218 prostate

adenocarcinomas samples, 83% of which were obtained at the primary sites; while Grasso et
al (50) obtained 61 prostate adenocarcinoma samples mostly (82%) from metastatic sites. In
the first study, genetic inactivation of RB1 occurred at 5% and genetic inactivation of TP53
at 5%, with co-occurrence at 1%. In the second study, the corresponding frequencies
increased to 28%, 52%, and 18%. Data from low-grade gliomas (TCGA, provisional) and
glioblastomas (51) revealed same trend. We therefore suggest that genetic inactivation of
pRb, p53 and most certainly both pRb and p53 could explain why more advanced cancer are
more likely to resist current therapies.

Antitumor mechanisms for “two hit” pRb deficient tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Two extraordinary characteristics of retinoblastoma are “two hit” RB1 loss and extremely
early onset. Retinoblastomas therefore may require few additional mutations. Xu et al
reported that cone photoreceptor precursors in normal human retina at mid-gestation express
high levels of MDM2 and N-Myc, likely because human MDM2 promoter contains a
binding sequence for the cone specific transcription factor RXRγ. Knockdown of RXRγ or
another cone specific transcription factor TRβ2 in cultured retinoblastoma cells inhibited
their ability to form orthotopic xenografts (52). Laurie et al on the other hand provided
evidence that Arf was dramatically activated in retinoblastomas, but MDM4 gene
amplification and overexpression prevented the activation of p53 (53). Whole genome
sequencing of four retinoblastomas revealed no genetic lesions in known oncogenes or
tumor suppressor genes other than RB1 and MYCN (54). Epigenetically, SYK, a protooncoprotein, was highly expressed in retinoblastomas. Inhibiting SYK with existing
inhibitors significantly delayed orthotopic xenografts by retinoblastoma cells (54). When the
genomic studies were expanded to 94 retinoblastomas, MYCN amplification was recurrent at
8.5% with the second most frequently amplified gene OTX2 at 3%. The second most
commonly deleted gene following RB1 is BCOR at 4% (55). The significance of these two
additional recurrent alterations now needs further study.
“Two hit” pRb deficient tumorigenesis is modeled in melanotrophs in pituitary
intermediate lobe (IL) in Rb1+/− mice

Author Manuscript

Using this model, various pRb targets, including E2F1, showed physiological relevance
since IL tumorigenesis was significantly delayed when any one of them was deleted in
Rb1+/− mice (56–62). pRb target Skp2 (63, 64) was an exception; its deletion resulted in
completely normal IL (65). When POMC-Cre was used to delete Rb1 in melanotrophs,
neoplastic transformation occurred across the entire IL in the presence of Skp2, but
apoptosis ablated the entire IL in the absence of Skp2. p27T187A knockin (66), which
prevents p27 ubiquitination by Skp2, achieved the same effect (65). The accumulation of
p27 led to more p27-cyclin A binding to replace E2F1-cyclin A binding on E2F target gene
promoters (67). Since cyclin A binding to E2F1 inhibits E2F1 activity (68–71), the cyclin A
unbound E2F1 activated E2F target genes to a higher degree than by loss of pRb alone. In
this context, deregulated E2F1 became apoptotic, demonstrable by enlarged IL following its
deletion (67). These findings suggest strategies to use E2F1’s apoptotic activity to treat pRb
deficient cancers.

Modeling retinoblastoma in mice revealed essential roles of p27
Cre mediated Rb1 deletion during eye development and germline KO of Rb family member
p107 are required to induce retinoblastoma in mice (72, 73). This could suggest that p107
compensated pRb loss in repressing E2F. However, co-deletion of Rb1 and p27 generated
more robust and more penetrant retinoblastoma and a p27 mutation that disrupts cyclin/Cdk
bindings was as effective as p27 deletion (74, 75). Therefore, binding and inhibiting
cyclin/Cdk by p27, or similarly by p107 (76), likely explains lack of retinoblastoma
following Rb1 deletion. Sangwan et al continued to show that i.p. injection of CDK
inhibitors (mimicking p27 increase) during pregnancy prevented retinoblastoma in Rb1 and
p107 or Rb1 and p27 DKO mice (74).

Co-deletion of Pten and Skp2 induced p53-independent senescence
Author Manuscript

Tumor suppressor roles of Pten have been amply demonstrated by its absence. However,
homozygous deletion of Pten in prostate epithelium (with PB-Cre) induced cellular
senescence rather than tumorigenesis (77), likely because oncogenic PI3K(Pten)-Akt
activates mTORC1 to activate p53 (see above). Combining Trp53 deletion with Pten
deletion avoided senescence and induced tumorigenesis (77). With this system, Lin et al
discovered that co-deletion of Pten with Skp2 induced more robust senescence in the
prostate (78). Skp2 deletion also inhibited tumorigenesis in Arf−/− mice (78). Detailed
studies with MEFs established that co-deletion of Pten and Skp2 induced senescence
without activating Arf-p53 and independent of Arf-p53, suggesting that targeting Skp2
could inhibit p53 deficient cancers (78).

Blocking Myc activity inhibited p53 deficient KRASG12D lung tumor
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

MYC is frequently overexpressed in tumors due to gene amplification (79), fusion, and other
oncogenic signaling such RAS (80), and Myc is a potent oncogene (81). To model anti-Myc
therapy, Soucek et al generated a dominant negative c-Myc, omomyc, to inhibit C-, N-, and
L-Myc together (82). Activation of KRASG12D in the lung for six weeks resulted in multiple
neoplastic lesions, systemic expression of omomyc shrank the lesions with increased
apoptosis by one week and completely resolved the lesions by one month (82). To determine
the role of p53 in the successful treatment, KRASG12D lung tumors were generated in the
absence of p53, which increased tumor burden, but omomyc remained effective (83). When
lymphomas, liver tumors, or osteosarcomas were induced by c-Myc overexpression,
subsequent de-expression regressed tumors with senescence that depended on p53 or pRb
(84). Possibly, systemic inhibition of Myc is important since Myc may function in stroma
cells to support tumorigenesis (85). Bromodomain inhibitors have shown efficacies targeting
Myc (86); it will be interesting to determine whether they could remain effective without
p53.

Two synthetic lethal relationships between PI3K(Pten)-Akt and Trp53
As discussed above, activation of PI3K(Pten)-Akt activates p53 (43, 44) and activated p53
inhibit PI3K(Pten)-Akt (42) (Figure 4a). And combined deletion of Pten and Trp53 induces
tumorigenesis (77). Interestingly, two alternative scenarios might turn p53 deficiency into

therapy advantage (Figure 4b, c). IGFs are typical activators of PI3K(Pten)-Akt. IGF1R
ligand IGF2 is often overexpressed in human cancers. Haley et al studied physiological
relationship between IGF2 and p53 (87). Mating of IGF2 and Trp53 doubly heterozygous
mice produced only 16 live births out of the expected 44 doubly deficient embryos,
revealing partial synthetic lethality during embryogenesis. The authors then used conditional
deletions to generate doubly deficient mice and found them partially protected from
spontaneous tumorigenesis, extending survival from 206 days (p53 cKO mice) to 325 days
(cDKO mice), revealing partial synthetic lethality in tumorigenesis as well (88) (Figure 4b).

Author Manuscript

Emerling et al based their study on frequent co-occurrences of TP53 mutation and PIP4K2B
gain in breast cancer (89). As shown in Figure 4c, PIP4K2B encodes for type 2
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases β (PI5P4Kβ), which generates PI3K substrate
PI-4,5-P2 from PI-5-P. PIP4K2B KO mice grew to adulthood, but PIP4K2B and Trp53
DKO embryos died in uterus. PIP4K2B+/− Trp53−/− mice grew up and showed identical
tumor susceptibility as Trp53−/− mice, but additional deletion of PIP4K2A protected
PIP4K2A−/− PIP4K2B+/− Trp53−/− mice from tumorigenesis and prolonged survival
(P=0.0166). We summarize these findings in Figure 4c. PIP4K2A−/− PIP4K2B+/− seemed a
sweet spot: it is just adequate to survive regardless of p53 status; but when p53 is deleted it
protected the mice from p53 deficient tumorigenesis. Further reduction in PIP4K2 dosage
might produce more dramatic effects if embryo lethality could be avoided by conditional
deletions and when the effects of PIP4K2C deletion are tested. Understanding the
underlying mechanisms between these synthetic lethal relationships should help identify
strategies to most effectively use them.

Deletion of MK2 improved DNA damaging chemotherapy for p53 deficient
Author Manuscript

cancer

Author Manuscript

DNA damage activates ATM-Chk2, ATR-Chk1, and p38-MK2 kinase cascades to activate
p53 to induce apoptosis, which is the rationale of DNA damaging chemotherapies. When
p53 is inactivated, Chk2, Chk1, and MK2 can phosphorylate and inhibit Cdc25 to arrest cell
cycle for repair, which forms the basis for therapy resistance. If this cell cycle arrest can be
prevented, cells with damaged DNA would progress and die by mitotic catastrophe, which
forms the rationale to treat p53 deficient cancers (90). In addition to Cdc25 (91), MK2 can
phosphorylate hnRNPA0 and PARN to stabilize Gadd45a mRNA (92), induce expression of
miR-34c to repress c-Myc (93), and inhibit DNA replication fork movement to stall DNA
synthesis (94). MK2 therefore may be most responsible for protecting p53 deficient cells
from DNA damaging therapy. When DNA damaging therapy was combined with MK2
inhibition, p53 deficient cancer cells preferentially responded with mitotic catastrophe (95).
Inhibition of ATM or Chk2 showed similar effects (96). MK2 studies have now progressed
to an autochthonous KRASG12D lung tumor model (97). A new design of Cre mediated
recombination generated both MK2+/+ and MK2−/− tumors in the same mice. When the lung
tumors were p53+/+, cisplatin treatment showed mild effects on MK2+/+ and MK2−/−
tumors. When Trp53 was deleted, cisplatin inhibited MK2−/− tumors with apoptosis much
more effectively than MK2+/+ tumors.

p53 deficient cancer could be more vulnerable to metabolic disruptions
A number of metabolic enzymes are encoded by p53 target genes and p53 regulates their
expression to improve homeostasis (98). This role of p53 theoretically could benefit tumor
cells too. If true, loss of p53 could render tumor cells more vulnerable to metabolism
disturbances. We use a few studies to explore this emerging concept.

Author Manuscript

p53 directly activates expression of TIGAR (99) (Figure 2a). TIGAR indirectly inhibits
phosphofructose kinase 1 (PFK1). PFK1 generates fructose 1,6-bisphsphoate in the
glycolytic cascade towards pyruvate. Through TIGAR, p53 restricts the flux of glycolysis
down from this point and divert the flux towards PPP (100). PPP generates ribose 5phosphate and reductant NADPH. By activating TIGAR, p53 therefore could support
proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Data for these speculations are now available.
Deletion of TIGAR impaired intestine mucosa regeneration after injury (normal cell
proliferation) and inhibited intestinal tumorigenesis by APC (tumor cell proliferation) (101).
On the glutamine side of cancer cell metabolism, p53 activates expression of glutaminase
(GLS2) (102, 103) (Figure 2b). Glutamate feeds into the TCA cycle to replenish the
anaplerotic carbon skeleton for biosynthesis and generates glutathione for antioxidant
defense, again both are advantageous for proliferating cells. Interestingly, when both studies
overexpressed GLS2 in lung cancer cell line H1299, cell proliferation in culture was
inhibited. While it is not clear how enhanced GLS2 inhibited cell proliferation, these results
raised the possibility that highly active p53 might use this mechanism to suppress
tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, p53 also functions to inhibit the generation of NADPH. p53 binds and inhibits
G6PD in the cytoplasm (104) and represses the expression of malic enzymes (105), both
leading to reduction of NADPH (Figure 2c). The consequent buildup of ROS activates p53
via AMPK, establishing a feed-forward loop to senescence (105). However, knockdown of
ME1,2 inhibited xenograft growth by HCT116 regardless of their p53 status. Thus, whether
p53 uses this mechanism to induce senescence in tumor cells remains unclear. On the other
hand, these findings suggest that inhibiting ME1,2 (or otherwise inhibiting NADPH
synthesis) could remain effective when p53 is genetically inactivated.

Author Manuscript

Using the isogenic p53 WT and KO HCT116 cells, Maddocks et al determined the role of
p53 in serine withdrawal challenge (106). While withdrawal of the essential amino acid
lysine inhibited proliferation of p53 WT and KO cells equally, withdrawal of the nonessential amino acid serine inhibited proliferation of p53 KO cells more significantly than
p53 WT cells in culture and in xenografts. In this case, serine withdrawal creates a shortage
of purine nucleotides to activate p53. Subsequent increase in p21 stimulated pRb to repress
E2F, blocking DNA synthesis to reduce ROS production, and inhibiting nucleotide synthesis
to favor glutathione synthesis (Figure 2d). Lack of these two mechanisms in p53 KO cells
led to ROS buildup and cell death. These findings are exciting not only because p53
deficiency generated a metabolic vulnerability but also because serine is a non-essential
amino acid. Its withdrawal therefore can be tolerated by normally proliferating cells.

Deletion of Skp2 blocked pRb and p53 doubly deficient tumorigenesis coexistent with ongoing DNA synthesis

Author Manuscript

As the two major tumor suppressors, pRb and p53 together may be responsible for most and
best of cells’ antitumor mechanisms, known (Figure 1) and yet to be learned (see above).
Genetic inactivation of both pRb and p53 would disable these antitumor mechanisms
permanently. Since Skp2 deletion induced synthetic lethality with Rb1 deletion in pituitary
melanotrophs (65, 67) and p53 independent senescence in prostate (78), Zhao et al
hypothesized that it could block pRb and p53 doubly deficient tumorigenesis in pituitary
melanotrophs and prostate. Their study (107) showed that p53 activates expression of Pirh2
and PKC1, two of the three (and Skp2) E3 ubiquitin ligases for p27 (108). Co-deletion of
Skp2 and p53 reduced the cellular pool of p27 ubiquitin ligases to allow p27 protein to
accumulate in pituitary and prostate. High levels of p27 inhibited cyclin dependent kinases
to activate pRb to induce the p53-independent senescence observed by Lin et al (78), but
additional deletion of Rb1 rendered DNA replication uninhabitable by p27 and abrogated the
senescence. However, inhibition of mitotic cyclin/Cdk by p27 arrested cells in G2/M
without pRb. The uninhabitable DNA replication was then maintained as DNA rereplication. E2F1 mediated apoptosis by co-deletion of Rb1 and Skp2 (67) likely could still
operate to gradually clear the mitotically blocked tumorigenic cells (please see Figure 5c for
more details).

Deletion of miR-17~92 prevented Rb1, p107, and Trp53 TKO mouse
retinoblastoma
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

miR-17~92 cluster is an onco-miR (109). Myc activates its expression (110) and it promotes
Eμ-Myc lymphomagenesis (111). miR-17~92 cluster contains six microRNA units (109).
Five of them can target Pten and Bim (a BH3 only apoptotic protein), explaining its
oncogenic activity (109). Two of the units (miR-17 and miR-20a) however also target E2F1
(110). Interestingly, Myc activates expression of E2F1,2,3 mRNA (112, 113), suggesting a
“promoting and dampening” regulation. Furthermore, E2F1,2,3 activate expression of Myc
(114) and miR-17~92 (115, 116). While pRb represses E2F1,2,3, p53 represses expression
of miR-17~92; and miR-17~92 is frequently overexpressed in human retinoblastoma (117,
118). Thus, miR-17~92 provides another mechanism to dampen E2F1 after loss of pRb
(Figure 5a, b). Remarkably, deletion of miR-17~92 completely prevented TKO (Rb1, p107,
Trp53) mouse retinoblastoma, resulting in normal retina (118). Using a Cre linked AP
reporter, of all the possible genotype combinations, only QKO (miR-17~92 KO and TKO)
retina were devoid of AP expression, suggesting that QKO synthetic lethally eliminated
retina progenitor cells as soon as they were generated (please see Figure 5d for more

Summary and perspective
A number of antitumor mechanisms have been identified that can effectively inhibit
tumorigenesis when the genes coding for pRb, p53, or both are deleted in autochthonous
mouse tumor models. One of them, combining DNA damaging therapy with MK2 deletion,

was rationally developed; most others were based on previous indirect rationales. Another
approach to candidate mechanisms is genetic screen with lower model organisms, such as
Drosophila (119, 120). Based on the findings so far, we predict continuous progress in these
directions.
Over 25 years of studies predict that cancers with genetic inactivation of both pRb and p53
would be severely deficient in antitumor mechanisms

It is encouraging that evidence is now available that pRb and p53 doubly deficient
tumorigenesis can be completely blocked at the levels of genetically defined autochthonous
mouse tumor models. With Skp2 deletion, the block was nevertheless accompanied with
life-long BrdU-labeling lesions, providing a new perspective in cancer treatment and raising
concerns to address whether tumor evolution in this context will overcome the block. The
lack of Skp2 mediated activation of Akt to promote cancer cell metabolism (121) and Skp2
mediated degradation of E-cadherin (122) might have kept the block durable. Blocking by
deleting miR-17~92 involved deletion of p107, which added some uncertainty since p107 is
not deleted in human cancer. Since miR-17~92 was deleted locally, the extent of side effects
when miR-17~92 is targeted globally needs to be determined. Mice deficient for miR-17~92
died at birth with hypoplastic lung, heart ventricular septal defect, and B cell development
failure (123).
Phamacological inhibition of Skp2 and miR-17~92 are rapidlly developing

Skp2 functions as a substrate recruiting subunit of SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase. Among the
many SCFSkp2 inhibitors (124–126), Compound #25 (C25) has shown inhibitory effects on
xenograft tumors by human lung cancer cell line A549 (activating mutation G12S in KRAS)
and prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (WT RB1, frameshift mutation in TP53), after systemic
administration (i.p. injection) (126). This line of preclinical studies could be directly
extended to test pRb and p53 doubly deficient human cancer cell lines.

An important feature of p27 polyubiquitnation by SCFSkp2 is the additional requirement for
Cks1 (127, 128), which provided an opportunity to selectively inhibit SCFSkp2-Cks1 (129–
131). On the other hand, since combined inactivation of Skp2 and p53 reduced the cellular
pool of p27 ubiquitin ligases including Skp2, Pirh2, and PKC1 to accumulate more p27
protein (107), broader inhibition of p27 ubiquitination and degradation might prove
beneficial. Remarkably, the proteasome inhibitor Argyrin A inhibited various tumor cell
lines by stablizing p27 protein in them (132). Finally, SCFSkp2 mediates K63-linked
ubiquitination of Akt for activation and this function of SCFSkp2 promotes tumorigenesis by
enhancing Warburg effects (121). C25 mediated inhibition of human cancer xenografts was
correlated with both accumulation of p27 protein and prevention of Akt activation and Glut1
expression (126). More studies are needed to determine the relative contributions of Skp2
mediated p27 degradation and Akt activation.
The tiny (8-mer targeting seed sequence) LNA (locked nucleic acid) anti-miR technology
can target groups of onco-miRs that share seed sequences, and require only salineformulation for systemic adminstration (133, 134). The miR-17~92 cluster’s six miRNA
components can be grouped into four seed sequences: miR-17,20a, miR-18a, miR-19a,

19b-1, and miR-92-1. Tiny LNA miR-17 and tiny LNA miR-19 i.v. administration was well
tolerated in adult mice while exhibited inhibitory effects on allograft subcutaneous and
orthotopic tumors by Ptch1+/− Trp53−/− medulloblastoma cells (135). This approach could
be used to determine the toxic effects of inhibiting all four seed sequences in the miR-17~92
cluster in adult mice and, if tolerated, the inhibitory effects on Rb1, p107, Trp53 TKO
retinoblastoma. It is possible that inhibiting a subgroup of these four seed sequences could
provide tumor inhibition without significant systemic toxicity.
Context is key

Most biological effects are context-dependent. The finality of gene deletions to inactivate
both pRb and p53 may provide certain consistency in the context when one attempts to
apply the above knowledge to other cancers and ultimately to clinical studies. In this regard,
it is notable that genetic inactivation of TP53 is largely by point mutations in human
cancers. For the bladder cancer that contained genetic inactivation of TP53 (67 out of 125
specimens, Figure 3a), p53 is null in 19 specimens by homozygous gene deletion, nonsense
mutations, or frame-shift mutations. The rest are missense mutations. Some of them, such as
p53R175H (2 specimens), R248Q (7 specimens), R273C (2 specimens), and R280T (3
specimens), gained new functions (GOF) (136). Mice with knockin of specific mutations,
p53R172H/- or p53R270H/- (equivalent to R175H and R273H in humans), developed
dramatically more carcinomas than p53 null mice. p53R273H and p53R280K can cooperate
with SREBP to upregulate expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes to disrupt spheroid
formation by mammary epithelial cells (137). When KRASG12D induced pancreatic cancer
on the background of p53R172H/-, p53R172H binds p73 to dissociate p73/NF-Y interaction
to activate expression of PDGFRB leading to metastasis, which is not observed on p53 WT
or p53 null background (138–140). These and many other studies (136, 141) indicate the
need to identify antitumor mechanisms that remain effective when p53 incurred GOF
mutations and pRb is genetically inactivated.

Figure 1. pRb and p53 in a condensed tumorigenic and tumor suppressive network

Author Manuscript

Proteins in red are pro-oncogenic; blue ones tumor suppressive. Black ones are neutral in
most contexts. Arrows are activating while blunt ends inhibiting. Solid lines demonstrate
direct molecular connections, dotted lines show functional connections when molecular
steps have not been defined. Pools of target genes are dark gray implying that some target
genes of an oncogene such as Myc could also negatively regulate oncogenesis. In their
respective positions in the p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-pRb and Arf-MDM2-p53 pathways, pRb
and p53 are activated by most oncogenic events. Cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis are
the most fundamental antitumor mechanisms and are mostly implemented by products of
E2F and p53 target genes. In parallel, E2F and p53 target genes also directly and indirectly
suppress cancer cell metabolism. Tumorigenesis or tumor suppression includes developing
compatible cell metabolism. Evidence are emerging that certain aspects of cancer cell
metabolism can drive tumorigenesis and disrupting some of them can induce cell cycle
arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Whether these effects may remain effective when pRb and
p53 are genetically inactivated have not been tested. Since similar situations also apply to
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT is listed in the same box with cancer cell
metabolism. General and more focused reviews in the literature provide more expansive and
in depth discussions of these topics (14, 98, 142–148).

Figure 2. The basics of cancer cell metabolism

Author Manuscript

We highlight (yellow) glucose and glutamine as two major fuels for cancer cell metabolism.
Their key metabolism steps (in gray fields) produce carbon skeletons (red) for biosynthesis
and reductive equivalents (green) for biosynthesis and antioxidant defense. A select few
effects of pRb and p53 on cancer cell metabolism are illustrated to accompany the text.
Metabolites connected by double blue line-arrows involve more than one steps. Please see
text for more details corresponding to (a, b, c, d).

p53KO (89). In addition to discussions in the text, it is of note that, in the absence of p53,
presence of 1 allele of PIP4K2B out of 4 alleles of PIP4K2A and PIP4K2B generated adult
mice, but presence of 2 alleles of PIP4K2A without both alleles of PIP4K2B did not produce
live birth. This finding demonstrates exquisite specificity distinguishing PIP4K2A from
PIP4K2B in substrate specificity, expression dynamics, and relationships with p53, alone or
together in various combinations, for further studies.

(a) illustrates a normal cell, in which pRb and p53 suppress tumorigenesis using
mechanisms involved in studies by Zhao et al and Nittner et al (107, 118). In addition to
degrading p27, Skp2 can ubiquitinate and degrade E-cadherin (122), ubiquitinate and
activate Akt to promote cancer cell metabolism (121), and many other substrates such as
FOXO1 (149). In addition to Pten, Bim and other tumor suppressive regulators, miR-17~92
represses E2F1,2,3 suggesting the importance of restraining these transcription factors in
tumorigenesis (109). Molecules and actions are more active when written in bold, drawn in
thicker lines, and shaded in bright colors in various combinations; the reverse is used when
molecules and actions are repressed. (b) illustrates a tumor cell following loss of both pRb
and p53. Prominent tumorigenic features include the activation of E2F1 and loss of p53
safeguard. Importantly, loss of pRb and p53 also enabled intrinsic antitumor mechanisms.
An activated E2F1 can induce apoptosis and loss of p53 reduced expression of Pirh2 and
KPC1 to render p27 protein more stable. Nevertheless, E2F1 activity is restrained by cyclin
A binding through the RxL motif and by miR-17~92 mediated repression and p27 levels are
kept low by more active Skp2. The outcome of these activating and restraining effects on
E2F1 and p27 is the appropriate balance between proliferation and apoptosis for successful
tumorigenesis. (c) displays the effects of combined Skp2 deletion. Lack of Skp2 decreased
the pool of p27 ubiquitin ligases (Skp2, Pirh2, and KPC1) further to dramatically increase
p27 to form more cyclin A-p27 complexes replacing cyclin A-E2F1 complexes and inhibit
more cyclin B kinases. The freed E2F1 is further activated to promote proliferation, such
that DNA synthesis became uninhabitable. Since expression of apoptotic target genes is also
increased, apoptosis also became more prominent. Inhibition of mitotic cyclin B by p27
induces mitotic arrest in the absence of pRb. Combined, mitotic arrest and ongoing
apoptosis blocked tumor progression in the presence of active DNA re-replication. Less
active Akt and therefore a weaker cancer cell metabolism and more stable E-cadherin and

therefore a stronger epithelial maintenance might also contribute in the life-long block. (d)
suggests the effects of combined deletion of miR-17~92. Since miR-17~92 is a potent oncomiR, its absence naturally inhibits tumorigenesis, which could be achieved by elevated Pten
and Bim. However, the requirement for loss of pRb to trigger synthetic lethality could
suggest the involvement of E2F1’s apoptotic activity when it is not repressed by
miR-17~92.
