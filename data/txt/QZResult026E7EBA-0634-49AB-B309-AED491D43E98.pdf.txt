(1). Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation, gene-specific hypermethylation or hypomethylation,
and loss of imprinting (LOI), are common in AML and other cancer
tissues. Global genomic DNA methylation levels tend to decrease in
each step of the progression from normal to AML cells as also
shown for other cancers (2). Gene-specific hypomethylation has
also been reported in cancer cells, including decreased methylation
of MAGE-1, a gene hypomethylated in malignant cells (3, 4). In
AML, gene-specific hypermethylation shows a specific pattern,
including frequent methylation and inactivation of the p15 tumor
suppressor gene (5, 6). DNA methylation is responsible for
imprinting in mammal cells or at least reflects the imprinted state
of a locus produced during gametogenesis that causes specific
genes to be expressed either by the paternally or maternally
inherited chromosome. LOI represents an early epigenetic event in
leukemogenesis that was found in blood from subjects with AML
and myelodysplastic syndrome but not in blood or hematopoietic
progenitor cells from normal individuals (7).
In the present study, we investigated the effects of low-dose
benzene exposure on DNA methylation using peripheral blood
DNA from subjects with well-characterized benzene exposure (8).
The investigation was designed to evaluate (a) DNA methylation
changes in AluI and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1)
repetitive elements as a surrogate of genome-wide methylation, (b)
promoter methylation of p15 and MAGE-1, and (c) changes in
allele-specific methylation of H19 to detect LOI.

Abstract
Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation, gene-specific hypermethylation/hypomethylation, and loss of imprinting (LOI), are common in acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other cancer tissues. We
investigated for the first time whether such epigenetic changes
are induced in healthy subjects by low-level exposure to
benzene, a widespread pollutant associated with AML risk.
Blood DNA samples and exposure data were obtained from
subjects with different levels of benzene exposure, including
78 gas station attendants, 77 traffic police officers, and 58
unexposed referents in Milan, Italy (personal airborne
benzene range, <6–478 Mg/m3). Bisulfite-PCR pyrosequencing
was used to quantitate DNA methylation in long interspersed
nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and AluI repetitive elements as a
surrogate of genome-wide methylation and examine genespecific methylation of MAGE-1 and p15. Allele-specific
pyrosequencing of the H19 gene was used to detect LOI in
96 subjects heterozygous for the H19 imprinting center G/A
single-nucleotide polymorphism. Airborne benzene was associated with a significant reduction in LINE-1 ( 2.33% for a
10-fold increase in airborne benzene levels; P = 0.009) and
AluI ( 1.00%; P = 0.027) methylation. Hypermethylation in
p15 (+0.35%; P = 0.018) and hypomethylation in MAGE-1
( 0.49%; P = 0.049) were associated with increasing airborne
benzene levels. LOI was found only in exposed subjects (4 of
73, 5.5%) and not in referents (0 of 23, 0.0%). However, LOI was
not significantly associated with airborne benzene (P > 0.20).
This is the first human study to link altered DNA methylation,
reproducing the aberrant epigenetic patterns found in
malignant cells, to low-level carcinogen exposure. [Cancer
Res 2007;67(3):876–80]

Materials and Methods
Subjects and Exposure Assessment
The study included 78 gasoline filling attendants and 77 urban traffic
officers exposed to low-benzene levels in Milan, Italy (8). Fifty-seven office
workers from the same area, frequency matched by gender, age, and
smoking to the exposed groups, were used as referents (Table 1). Personal
exposure to airborne benzene was higher in gas station attendants than in
traffic officers, whereas levels were lowest in the reference group (Table 1).
Benzene exposure was determined by a passive sampler (stainless steel
tube, internal diameter of 9 mm, length of 90 mm) containing Chromosorb
106, worn by the study subjects near the breathing zone during the work
shift. Benzene was determined by thermal desorption followed by gas
chromatography/flame ionization detector analysis. Written informed
consent was obtained from the study subjects, and approval was granted
by the local Institutional Review Board.

Introduction
Exposure to benzene, a widespread airborne pollutant emitted
from traffic exhaust fumes and cigarette smoking, has been
consistently associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
but the mechanisms relating benzene to AML risk are still unclear

to purify the final PCR product using Sepharose beads. The PCR product
was bound to Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance (Amersham
Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the Sepharose beads containing the
immobilized PCR product were purified, washed, denatured using a
0.2 mol/L of NaOH solution, and washed again using the Pyrosequencing
Vacuum Prep Tool (Pyrosequencing, Inc., Westborough, MA) as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Then, 0.3 Amol/L of pyrosequencing
primer was annealed to the purified single-stranded PCR product and
pyrosequencing was done using the PSQ HS96 Pyrosequencing System

added and mixed. The samples were incubated at 50jC for 16 h. The
bisulfite-treated DNA was isolated using Wizard DNA Clean-Up System
(Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was eluted by 50 AL of warm water, and
5.5 AL of 3 mol/L NaOH were added for 5 min. The DNA was ethanol

(Pyrosequencing). The degree of methylation was expressed for each DNA
locus as percentage methylated cytosines over the sum of methylated and
unmethylated cytosines. We used non-CpG cytosine residues as built-in
controls to verify bisulfite conversion. Each marker was tested in three
replicates and their average was used in the statistical analysis.
Repetitive elements AluI and LINE-1. AluI and LINE-1 element PCR
was used for pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis using previously
published methods (10) with the following modifications. A 25 AL PCR was
carried out in 10 AL Eppendorf HotMaster Taq DNA kit (Eppendorf,
Westbury, NY), 1 pmol biotinylated forward primer, 1 pmol reverse primer,
50 ng bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, and water.
MAGE-1 and p15. To measure methylation of the MAGE-1 and p15
promoters, a 25 AL PCR was carried out in 10 AL Eppendorf HotMaster Taq
DNA kit, 10 pmol forward primer, 10 pmol reverse primer, 50 ng bisulfitetreated genomic DNA, and water.

Results
DNA methylation by occupational groups. LINE-1 methylation was lower in the benzene-exposed subjects compared with the
referents (Table 3). The average percentage of methylated cytosines
in LINE-1 sequences was 62.2% (SD, 6.6) in gas station attendants,
62.3% (SD, 6.5) in traffic officers, and 65.7% (SD, 5.2) in referents
(P = 0.003 for differences among the occupational groups). AluI
methylation showed a moderate nonsignificant decrease in gas
station attendants (mean, 26.4%; SD, 2.5), with no change in traffic
officers (mean, 27.5%; SD, 3.9), compared with referents (mean,
27.3%; SD, 3.4; P = 0.12).
Gene-specific analysis showed low p15 methylation in the
referent group (mean, 1.2; SD, 0.9) that increased significantly in
traffic officers (mean, 2.0; SD, 1.0) and gas station attendants
(mean, 2.0; SD, 1.2; P < 0.001). MAGE-1 was highly methylated and
showed no differences in the three groups (Table 3).
DNA methylation and airborne benzene exposure. LINE-1
and AluI methylation decreased with increasing airborne benzene
exposure levels (Fig. 1A and B). This decrease, estimated for a
10-fold increase in airborne benzene, was equal to 2.33% [95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 4.06 to 0.60; P = 0.009] for LINE-1
and 1.00% (95% CI, 1.87 to 0.11; P = 0.027) for AluI.
Airborne benzene was associated with increased methylation in
p15 (+0.35%; 95% CI, 0.06–0.64; P = 0.018; Fig. 1C). MAGE-1
exhibited decreased methylation (Fig. 1D), but the association with
airborne benzene was borderline significant ( 0.49%; 95% CI,
0.96 to 0.00; P = 0.049).
In multivariable regression analyses, the estimated changes in
DNA methylation did not differ when several combinations of
possible confounders, including age, sex, smoking (never, ex, and
current), urine cotinine, cigarettes/day, pack-years, years since
smoking cessation, alcohol, metabolic polymorphisms (NQO1 and
CYP2E1), and percentage lymphocytes in the differential count
(data not shown).
DNA methylation exhibited no consistent association with
smoking status, number of cigarettes/day, urinary cotinine, packyears, and years from smoking cessation (P > 0.05 for all DNA
sequences considered). Notably, AluI methylation exhibited a
borderline negative correlation with pack-years of smoking (r =
0.13%; P = 0.06).

H19 (LOI Assay)
H19 allele-specific methylation was done as a surrogate marker of LOI.
An article describing this newly developed technique is under consideration
(11). This technology relies on two individual primers that are directed
against one allele but not the other of a single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) so that nucleotide extension analysis by pyrosequencing can be done
on each allele individually. Briefly, the protocol involves bisulfite treatment
of DNA, PCR amplification, and then pyrosequencing of the CTCF-binding
domain using allele-specific primers.
H19 genotyping. First, heterozygosity for the G/A SNP within the H19
imprinting center (rs2071094; dbSNP build 124; Genbank AF125183,
nucleotide 8008) was determined by pyrosequencing. A 135-bp region was
amplified on human genomic DNA with the PCR primers 5¶-GGTCTCACCGCCTGGATC-3¶ and 5¶-biotin-GACCCGGGACGTTTCCAC-3¶ and
genotyped with the sequencing primer 5¶-ACAGCCCGAGCCCGC-3¶ using
standard pyrosequencing.
LOI assay. A nested PCR was done on DNA from heterozygote subjects.
Bisulfite-modified DNA (2 AL) was amplified in a primary PCR followed by a
second nested PCR using 1 AL of the primary PCR product. PCR was done
in 25 AL volume using 10 pmol of each primer and the Eppendorf
HotMaster Taq DNA kit at reagent concentrations as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Statistical Analysis
Student’s t test and ANOVA were used to test for differences in
methylation levels by categorical variables. We used linear regression
analysis to assess the association of logarithmic airborne benzene, or other
continuous variables, with DNA methylation. All statistical tests were two
sided.

and unmethylated, 0%). All of these four subjects were in the
benzene-exposed groups, with airborne benzene levels equal to 34,
276, 47, and 28 Ag/m3, respectively.

Loss of imprinting. We determined allele-specific DNA methylation of H19 as a marker for LOI. Because this assay is applicable
only to subjects who are heterozygotes in the H19 G/A SNP
(rs2071094; dbSNP build 124) used for allele-specific detection, only
96 subjects who had the G/A genotype were available for this test.
We estimated the average methylation of the methylated allele
(mean, 74.5%; SD, 20.5), of the unmethylated allele (mean, 2.85%;
SD, 4.62), and of their difference (mean, 71.7%; SD, 21.9). None of
these quantities was associated with airborne benzene (P > 0.20).
We identified, however, four subjects that showed aberrant
methylation patterns. Three of them showed both an increase of
methylation in the unmethylated allele and a decrease in the
methylated allele (subject 1: methylated, 22.9% and unmethylated,
9.0%; subject 2: methylated, 17.6% and unmethylated, 9.3%; subject
3: methylated, 25.2% and unmethylated, 12.1%). One more subject
had one normally unmethylated allele with a large decrease in
methylation of the methylated allele (subject 4: methylated, 16.5%

Discussion
In vitro and animal studies have shown that carcinogenic agents
induce DNA methylation changes in normal tissues similar to those
found in malignant cells (12–15). In our study, we observed DNA
methylation alterations in subjects exposed to low-level airborne
benzene that were qualitatively comparable with those observed in
AML and other malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study in humans to link altered DNA methylation patterns
to exposure to any carcinogen at levels that are common in
Western countries.
We used DNA methylation analyses of LINE-1 and AluI repeated
sequences to evaluate global methylation. Due to the heavy

in the activity of DNA methyltransferases (17). In addition, reactive
oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage produced by benzene
may reduce binding affinity of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2,
thereby resulting in epigenetic alterations (18). At the same time,
DNA strand breaks induced by benzene exposure may cause DNA
methyltransferases to bind with higher affinity at specific sites (19).
Some of our findings open further questions warranting future
investigation. LINE-1 element methylation changes had a stronger
correlation with benzene exposure than AluI repetitive elements.
Hypothetically, this could be explained as methylation of LINE-1 and
AluI is controlled through different mechanisms (20). Alternatively,
the lower concentration of CpG sites in AluI elements may result in
lower sensitivity for the use of AluI methylation as a global DNA
methylation marker. We found no consistent association of DNA
methylation with smoking, which is the largest source of benzene in
subjects without occupational exposure. However, tobacco smoke is
a mixture of a high number of agents with complex synergic effects
that could level off the effect due to tobacco-derived benzene. In
addition, multivariable models indicated that smoking was not a
confounder of the relation between benzene and DNA methylation.
In spite of the clear dose-response relationship between DNA
methylation and airborne benzene, indicating that benzene
exposure was the main factor responsible for DNA methylation
changes in our study, we cannot exclude that other traffic
pollutants, including particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, CO, SO2, NO2, toluene, or xylene, may have contributed to
the observed changes.
In conclusion, our study showed for the first time that low-level
benzene exposure is associated in normal subjects with DNA methylation changes that reproduce the aberrant epigenetic patterns
found in malignant cells. Additional studies are required to better
define the mechanisms by which benzene and other carcinogens
produce such alterations.

methylation of repetitive elements, these assays, which are easier
to do than previous methods to quantitate total genomic 5methylcytosine, can detect decreases in DNA methylation and
serve as a surrogate for global methylation (10). Our results showed
an exposure-related decrease in the methylation of LINE-1 and AluI
repeated sequences. This observation is consistent with the global
hypomethylation frequently observed in AML and other malignant
cells, which has been linked to higher chromosomal instability
and aberrant activation of cellular genes (2). The alterations we
observed were small in size and may represent an early deviation
induced by the exposure from normal methylation patterns.
In our study, p15 promoter methylation in exposed individuals
was nearly twice as high as that observed in the referent unexposed
subjects. AML is one of the few neoplasms that show hypermethylation of p15 , likely contributing to deregulated cell
proliferation (5). The p15 promoter shows low or no methylation
in normal cells and is hypermethylated as the cell progresses
through the multistep process leading to the development of the
full malignant phenotype (5, 16). MAGE-1, which is usually heavily
methylated in normal tissues, tended to exhibit lower methylation
in association with airborne benzene levels in our study. This
finding may indicate the initial activation of biological processes
in exposed subjects, potentially preceding the profound MAGE-1
hypomethylation observed in several tumors of various histologic
types, including leukemias (3, 4).
LOI, also diffusely seen in malignant cells, was not significantly
associated with benzene exposure in our study. Our LOI assay allows
for the determination of LOI only in H19 heterozygote subjects, thus
limiting the statistical power for this analysis. However, the finding
that changes in allele-specific methylation were present in four
exposed subjects and no controls warrants further investigations.
Our study was based on quantitative analysis of DNA
methylation using pyrosequencing methodology, which is highly
reproducible and accurate at measuring small changes in DNA
methylation. DNA methylation analysis was repeated thrice on
each sample to minimize the assay variability.
The mechanism by which benzene interferes with DNA methylation remains unclear. Benzene enhances nitric oxide production in
the bone marrow, possibly inducing a posttranscriptional increase
