Abstract
Chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of colorectal
cancer generally include oxaliplatin, although inherent and
acquired resistance is common. One potential mediator of
oxaliplatin sensitivity is the nonreceptor protein tyrosine
kinase, Src, the activity of which correlates with disease stage
and patient survival. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
Src inhibition using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib on
oxaliplatin sensitivity. We show that oxaliplatin acutely
activates Src and that combination treatment with dasatinib
is synergistic in a cell-line dependent manner, with the level of
Src activation correlating with extent of synergy in a panel of
six cell lines. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
generated after oxaliplatin treatment, and ROS potently
activates Src. Pretreatment with antioxidants inhibits oxaliplatin-induced Src activation. In oxaliplatin-resistant cell
lines, Src activity is constitutively increased. In a mouse
model of colorectal liver metastases, treatment with oxaliplatin also results in chronic Src activation. The combination of
dasatinib and oxaliplatin results in significantly smaller
tumors compared with single-agent treatment, corresponding
with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis. Therefore, we
conclude that oxaliplatin activates Src through a ROSdependent mechanism. Src inhibition increases oxaliplatin
activity both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Src
inhibitors combined with oxaliplatin may have efficacy in
metastatic colon cancer and may provide the first indication
of a molecular phenotype that might be susceptible to such
combinations. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3842–9]

Introduction
Metastatic colorectal cancer remains incurable for patients with
surgically unresectable disease. The approval of new chemotherapy
agents, such as the third-generation platinum analogue, oxaliplatin,
has led to improved outcomes for patients with metastatic disease.
Nevertheless, these patients inevitably develop refractory disease,
with overall survival only f2 years.

Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent that
forms platinum-DNA adducts that block DNA replication, leading
to cell cycle arrest and cell death (1). Platinum-based compounds
also induce cytotoxicity through oxidative stress (2–4) and may
lead to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) both directly
and indirectly (5, 6). Resistance to platinum agents occurs through
several mechanisms, including decreased platinum influx, improved base excision repair, and/or increased detoxification by
glutathione and metallothionein (1).
Reversing resistance has been proven challenging in part due to
the inability to pharmacologically modulate these pathways.
Recently, however, Src family kinases, for which inhibitors are in
trial, have been implicated in drug resistance (7). Src is the
prototype of this nine-member family and is activated by
numerous growth stimulatory, migratory, and stress pathways (8).
Src activity increases in >70% of colon tumors relative to adjacent
mucosa, with the highest activity observed in metastases (9, 10),
and correlates inversely with patient survival (11). Although Src has
been implicated in a myriad of cellular processes that are
deregulated in cancer, current evidence suggests that Src activation
is critical to mechanisms regulating tumor progression and
metastasis [refs. 12–14; reviewed by Summy and Gallick (8)]. As a
result, coupled with the recent availability of relatively nontoxic Src
family kinase inhibitors, numerous clinical trials have been
initiated using small-molecule Src family inhibitors in solid tumors
[reviewed by Kopetz and colleagues (7)].
Evidence from preclinical work suggests that Src alters sensitivity
to various chemotherapeutics, including platinum-based chemotherapy (15–17). In an ovarian carcinoma cell line, treatment with
the Src inhibitor PP2 reversed cisplatin resistance in a multidrug
resistance cell line compared with its isogenic control (18).
Expression of a dominant-negative, kinase-defective Src mutant
resulted in increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin-mediated apoptosis
in KM12-L4 human colon tumor cells in vitro (15). Predicting in
which tumor cells Src inhibition would be a valuable addition to
chemotherapeutic regimens using oxaliplatin and better understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs would lead to improved
selection of patients that would benefit from Src inhibitors.
In the current study, we investigated the antitumor activity of
dasatinib, an orally bioavailable, potent, multitargeted kinase
inhibitor of Src (19), in combination with oxaliplatin using in vitro
and in vivo models. We evaluated the effect of chronic exposure to
oxaliplatin on Src activity both in vitro and in vivo. In colon tumors
grown in the livers of nude mice, treatment with either agent alone
resulted in nonsignificant reductions in tumor size, whereas
combination therapy markedly diminished hepatic tumor volume.
Using in vitro studies, the ability of oxaliplatin to induce both Src
activity and ROS correlated with effectiveness of the combination

treatment. We show that Src inhibition in combination with
oxaliplatin has efficacy in metastatic colon cancer and provide the
first indication of a molecular phenotype that might be susceptible
to such combinations.

Materials and Methods
Colon cancer cell lines and culture conditions. HT29, LS174T, SW480,
and HCT116 (American Tissue Culture Collection) and KM12-L4 and
DiFi (gifts of Dr. I.J. Fidler, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center) cells, all derived from human colon adenocarcinomas,
were maintained as a subconfluent monolayer in DMEM/F-12 nutrient
mixture and 2 mmol/L glutamine (HT29, LS174T, SW480, and HCT116),
MEM with sodium pyruvate, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids
(KM12-L4), or complete McCoy’s medium (DiFi) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) without antibiotics. All cells were
incubated in 5% CO2 at 37jC. Cells were routinely screened for Mycoplasma
and found to be Mycoplasma-free. Oxaliplatin-resistant HT29-OxR and
KM12-OxR cell lines were established and maintained as described
previously (20).
Cytotoxicity assays. Oxaliplatin (Sanofi-aventis; purchased from the
institutional pharmacy) was freshly prepared in deionized water for each
experiment. Dasatinib (provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb), a multitargeted
kinase inhibitor of Src family kinases and Abl, was prepared as a 10 mmol/L
stock solution in DMSO. Proliferation was determined by the 3-(4,5-

dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described
previously (21).
For combination treatments, 5,000 cells were plated overnight followed by
treatment with increasing doses of dasatinib and oxaliplatin individually and
in combination at a fixed ratio. Dasatinib was added 30 min before oxaliplatin
unless stated otherwise. Combination indices were obtained using Calcusyn
2.0 (Biosoft) using methods of Chou and Talalay for formal synergy analyses
(22). Synergy was defined based on the terminology of Chou (23).
For clonogenic assays, 200 or 500 cells were plated on 10 cm plates,
allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then treated with specified doses of
oxaliplatin and/or dasatinib for 48 h. After 14 days, plates were fixed with
ethanol and stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v). Colonies containing >50
cells were manually counted. Comparison of resulting colony counts was
done with the two-tailed t test.
Transfection. Subconfluent HT29 cells were transfected with two Srctargeted small interfering RNA expression plasmids and vector alone as
published previously (24). Single colonies of stable transfectants were
isolated and expanded for further analysis.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed and clarified
and proteins were separated via 8% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham; ref. 24). The membranes
were incubated with anti-Src monoclonal antibody (MAb327; CalbiochemNovabiochem), anti-phospho-SrcY416 and anti-h-actin polyclonal antibodies
(both from Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-thioredoxin (BD Biosciences)
followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad).
Proteins were visualized by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence

oxaliplatin-induced inhibition of proliferation. Two HT29 clones
(Src si-18 and Src si-23) with reduced Src expression were
generated by stable transfection of a vector expressing a
small interfering RNA to Src. By a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the two clones with
reduced Src expression showed increased sensitivity to
increasing doses of oxaliplatin, an effect that is replicated in
triplicate independent experiments. Mean F intraexperimental

oxaliplatin in clonogenic assays. Two hundred cells of each of
the HT29 parental and the cloned cell lines were treated with
oxaliplatin (2.5 Amol/L) and colony formation was measured as
described in Materials and Methods. The two clones had
reduced colony formation compared with the parental cell line
after treatment with oxaliplatin. *, P < 0.01, percent colony

Figure 2. Effects of combination treatment with the Src inhibitor dasatinib and oxaliplatin on growth are cell line dependent. A, cells were treated with 100 nmol/L
(HT29) or 350 nmol/L (LS174T, DiFi, and KM12-L4) dasatinib, 5 Amol/L (DiFi), 13 Amol/L (HT29 and LS174T), or 19 Amol/L (KM12-L4) oxaliplatin, or the combination.
Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, absorbance at 570 nmol/L was measured at baseline and every 24 h for 3 days. Cell
growth of HT29 and LS174T was less after combination treatment than after treatment with either agent alone by day 3 (P < 0.01 for each comparison). Mean F SD of
representative of three similar experiments, normalized to baseline (day 0) absorbance. B, formal synergy analysis by median-effects method shows cell line–dependent
response. Cytotoxicity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide of the combination of dasatinib and oxaliplatin using median-effects method
shows varying patterns of interaction for each of the four primary cell lines. Combination indices <1 are increasingly supraadditive, whereas values >1 are increasingly
less than additive. A fractional effect of 1 represents complete cytotoxicity for the combination, where 0 is no effect. The combination indices for LS174T and DiFi remain
<1 for all fractional effects. Representative of experiments done in triplicate. Dotted lines, modeled 95% confidence intervals. C, clonogenic assay following combination
treatment. Five hundred HT29 and KM12-L4 cells were treated with 2.5 Amol/L oxaliplatin, 100 nmol/L dasatinib, or the combination, and colony formation was
measured after 14 days. There were fewer colonies after combination treatment than treatment with either agent alone for HT29 but not KM12-L4. *, P < 0.05 versus
control; #, P < 0.001 versus control; c, P < 0.01 versus both single-agent dasatinib and oxaliplatin. Mean F SD from six independent replicates. D, combination

blot after 1 h of 2.5 Amol/L oxaliplatin exposure on a log scale is plotted against the combination index of oxaliplatin and dasatinib from the median-effects analysis
at the 50% fractional effect (IC50 for the combination). Combination indices <1 are increasingly supraadditive, whereas values >1 are increasingly less than additive. Cell
lines with Src activation after oxaliplatin exposure have a trend toward increasing additivity of the combination of a Src inhibitor and oxaliplatin. Diamond, cell line.

detection reagents (Perkin-Elmer) and exposure to film. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (500 Ag protein) were incubated 12 h at 4jC with 10 AL of
the total Src monoclonal antibody as described previously (24).
Oxidative stress assays. Cells (70% confluent) were trypsinized, washed,
and exposed to ROS-reactive 10 Amol/L 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(Molecular Probes) or a ROS-insensitive analogue 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate for 30 min in the dark at 37jC (25). Cells were washed and
analyzed by flow cytometry using the FL1 channel (FACSCalibur; Becton
Dickinson). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience).
The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma) and Tiron (Sigma) were
used as negative controls. Thioredoxin reductase activity was evaluated
using a colorimetric assay (Cayman Chemical) as described previously (26).
Murine hepatic tumor model. Male athymic nude mice (NCI-nu/nu;
Animal Production Area, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer
Research & Development Center) were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions in American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care-approved facilities. To produce hepatic tumors,
1  106 viable HT29 cells were injected directly into the left lobe of the liver
as described previously (27).
Treatment of established hepatic tumors. Fourteen days after hepatic
injection, mice were randomized into four treatment groups: control,
oxaliplatin, dasatinib, or oxaliplatin and dasatinib in combination.
Oxaliplatin was dissolved in 5% dextrose, diluted in HBSS, and injected

intraperitoneally at a concentration of 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Dasatinib
(15 mg/kg) was solubilized in a citrate/citric acid buffer and administered
by daily oral gavage. Control animals received citrate buffer daily and HBSS
twice weekly. Mice were weighed weekly and monitored daily.
Necropsy procedures. All mice were sacrificed on day 42 after tumor cell
injection, weighed, and necropsied. Tumors were excised and measured, with
volume calculated by standard techniques (28). Statistical comparison between
groups was done by t test with Welch correction for unequal variances.
Processing for immunohistochemistry was done as described previously (14).
Antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis. Primary antibodies
were purchased from the following manufacturers: rabbit anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; A20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Biocare Medical), rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody
(BD Bioscience), and mouse anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen clone
PC10 (DAKO). Secondary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, F(ab¶)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Biocare Medical),
streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (DAKO), rat anti-mouse IgG2a
horseradish peroxidase (Serotec, Harlan Bioproducts for Science), and goat
anti-rat horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
Fluorescent secondary antibodies used were Alexa 488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rat
IgG (Molecular Probes).

Figure 3. Induction of ROS following Src activation.
A, immunoblotting was done for phospho-Src and
total Src after 1 h incubation with H2O2 (1 mmol/L)
alone or with a 30 min pretreatment with 24 mmol/L
NAC, showing a robust Src activation by ROS.
B, generation of ROS by increasing concentrations
of oxaliplatin. HT29 cells were treated for 60 min
with specified oxaliplatin doses. Cells were stained
with the fluorescent dye 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA ), which becomes fluorescent in
the presence of intracellular ROS. Flow cytometry
was done as described in Materials and Methods.

exposure to oxaliplatin (0.25 Amol/L) in HT29 and
KM12-L4 cells treated with the ROS-sensitive
fluorescent probe 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate.
As a negative control, HT29 cells were treated with
oxaliplatin (0.25 Amol/L) and the ROS-insensitive
fluorescent probe 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein
diacetate (CF-DA ). Columns, mean of three
experiments; bars, SD. D, effect of oxaliplatin on

were immunoblotted. Fold increases of phospho-Src
relative to total Src by densitometry are shown,
normalized to untreated cells. Densitometry values
and blots are representative of triplicate assays.

Immunohistochemical procedures for proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
cleaved caspase-3, and VEGF were done and quantitated as described
previously (29, 30). Control samples exposed to a secondary antibody alone
showed no specific staining. Frozen sections embedded in OCT compound
were used for CD31 (PECAM-1) staining and quantification was done as
described previously (13).
Statistical differences for continuous variables were examined using the
two-tailed Student’s t test, with Pearson’s correlation coefficients used to
describe the relationship between two continuous variables. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. SDs represent interexperimental variability unless otherwise stated.

Results
Effect of oxaliplatin on Src activity. Numerous forms of stress
including cisplatin treatment lead to Src activation (31); however,
the effect of oxaliplatin was not determined previously. For these
studies, HT29, LS174T, KM12-L4, and DiFi colon cancer cells were
examined for molecular and biological differences among these
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 32). Cells were treated with
2.5 Amol/L oxaliplatin and expression of total Src and phospho-Src
(recognizing phospho-SrcY418, the activated form of Src) was
examined at various times thereafter. Increases in phospho-Src but
not total Src as well as phospho-FAK861 but not T-FAK were
observed at 1h after oxaliplatin treatment in HT29 (Fig. 1A) and
LS174T and DiFi (Supplementary Fig. S2) cell lines, with return to
the baseline activation by 6 h (Fig. 1A). Kinetics and magnitude of

www.aacrjournals.org

activations were similar to that induced by growth factors and
other chemotherapeutic agents (33, 34). Conversely, activated Src
decreased in the KM12-L4 cell line. These results show that
oxaliplatin induces Src activation in some but not all colon cancer
cells.
Src down-regulation sensitizes HT29 cells to oxaliplatin. To
specifically examine the role of Src in regulating oxaliplatin
sensitivity, HT29 cells were stably transfected with small interfering
RNA constructs targeting the c-src gene (90% reduction of Src;
Fig. 1B) as described in Materials and Methods. Reduced
expression of Src led to increased cytotoxicity in response to
oxaliplatin (Fig. 1B) and reduced colony formation (Fig. 1C). Thus,
Src activity mediates oxaliplatin sensitivity/resistance in some
colon cancer cell lines.
Pharmacologic inhibitor of Src is synergistic with oxaliplatin. To further explore the effect of Src inhibition on oxaliplatin
sensitivity, growth of the abovementioned cells at subconfluency
was determined after exposure to fixed doses of oxaliplatin,
dasatinib, or the combination. The combination of dasatinib and
oxaliplatin was significantly more effective in inhibiting cell growth
than either agent alone in HT29 and LS174T cells (the lines in
which oxaliplatin had the greatest ability to induce Src activation)
but not in DiFi and KM12-L4 cells (Fig. 2A). Formal synergy
calculations were done as described in Materials and Methods
(Fig. 2B). At the IC50 for the combination, the summary

combination indices were 0.05, 0.25, 0.78, and 1.52 for LS174T, DiFi,
HT29, and KM12-L4, respectively, showing synergy for LS174T and
DiFi. At the IC50, the combination index suggested a modest supraadditive effect for HT29. The above results were confirmed with a
clonogenic assay (Fig. 2C).
There were no clear distinctions in histology, molecular
phenotypes, or single-agent chemotherapy sensitivity of the cell
lines that might account for synergy with the combination of
oxaliplatin and the Src inhibitor. However, in the cell lines
evaluated, the extent of Src activation following oxaliplatin
treatment appeared to correlate with the degree of additivity of
combination treatment, suggesting that dasatinib provides the
most synergy in cells with a robust Src activation after oxaliplatin
administration. To further explore this hypothesis, two additional
cell lines (HCT116 and SW480) were evaluated. The SW480 cell line
robustly activated Src after oxaliplatin treatment (combination
index of 0.45 at the IC50), whereas HCT116 cells were inhibited in
Src activity after oxaliplatin and failed to show synergy with the
combination (combination index of 1.59 at the IC50). The ability to
activate Src in different cells after oxaliplatin suggests a trend
toward a significant correlation (Fig. 2D).
Oxaliplatin-induced Src activation is mediated by ROS. As
oxaliplatin has been implicated in generation of ROS, and oxidative
stress is known to activate Src, we determined if there were a
relationship between ROS production and Src activation. As shown
in Fig. 3A, hydrogen peroxide (as a positive control) activated Src
and increased FAK phosphorylation, which was inhibited with the
ROS inhibitor NAC in HT29 cells. Therefore, HT29 cells were
treated with oxaliplatin and ROS levels were examined as described
in Materials and Methods. A dose-dependent increase in intracellular ROS was evident 30 min after oxaliplatin treatment in the
HT29 cell line when the redox-sensitive fluorescent probe 2¶,7¶dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used (Fig. 3B and white columns
in Fig. 3C) but not when the redox-insensitive probe 5-(and-6)carboxyfluorescein diacetate was used (Fig. 3C, gray columns). In
contrast, increased intracellular ROS was not observed in KM12-L4
cells (Fig. 3C, black columns), suggesting that cell-dependent
differences in Src activation may correlate with ROS generation
after oxaliplatin administration. Pretreatment with NAC at
concentrations that showed no cellular toxicity within 24
h abolished the ROS increase after oxaliplatin treatment (data
not shown). Pretreatment with NAC and the antioxidant vitamin E
analogue Tiron inhibited Src and FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 3D),
showing that oxaliplatin activation of Src in HT29 cells is ROSdependent. Src activation is also observed after NAC or Tiron
treatment likely due to activation of proliferation pathways
(3, 35).
However, at the concentrations used in this study, oxaliplatin did
not affect thioredoxin reductase activity required for maintenance
of the intracellular antioxidant thioredoxin (Supplementary
Fig. S3B; ref. 36).
Intrahepatic tumor growth is inhibited by combination
therapy. We determined if the above-described effects also
occurred on growth of colon tumor cells in the liver, best
approximating the stage of disease in which treatment would
commence for metastatic colon cancer patients. We therefore
examined the effects of dasatinib, alone or in combination with
oxaliplatin, on established colorectal tumors in the liver using
HT29 cells. The results (Fig. 4) show similar rates of tumor
formation with incidences of 80% to 89% for all groups. Treatment
with either dasatinib or oxaliplatin as monotherapies led to no

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

statistically significant reductions in tumor size at the concentrations used. In contrast, combination therapy resulted in a
significant 92% reduction in tumor volume relative to untreated
controls (P < 0.01). None of the treatment schema affected mouse
weight nor were signs of toxicity evident.
Effect of combination therapy on tumor proliferation
and apoptosis. Treatment with oxaliplatin and dasatinib in
combination reduced proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive
cells by 90% versus controls (P < 0.001) and an additional 32% to
34% compared with either dasatinib or oxaliplatin alone (P < 0.001;
Fig. 5). Cleaved caspase-3-positive cells (Fig. 5) and TUNEL-positive
cells (data not shown) increased after treatment with oxaliplatin
and combination therapy compared with control. Thus, in this
model, oxaliplatin and dasatinib in combination are effective in
inhibiting tumor cell growth in vivo.
Dasatinib inhibited VEGF and reduced microvessel count.
As also shown in Fig. 5, oxaliplatin monotherapy resulted in VEGF
staining equivalent to that of untreated control cells. However,
treatment with dasatinib, alone and in combination with
oxaliplatin, significantly reduced VEGF expression by tumor cells.
Dasatinib and oxaliplatin reduced vessel count by 53% and 55%
(P < 0.005), respectively, and by 89% (P < 0.001) in combination

Src Mediates Oxaliplatin Sensitivity

relative to untreated controls, an additional 33% reduction versus
either agent alone (P < 0.001), suggesting that oxaliplatin has
additional effects on vessels that are independent of VEGF.
Chronic oxaliplatin exposure is associated with stable Src
activation. To assess the effect of oxaliplatin on Src activity in vivo,
we subjected whole tumor lysates from each group in the murine
experiment to Western blot analysis. Oxaliplatin monotherapy
(5 mg/kg) resulted in f3-fold increase in SrcY418 phosphorylation
compared with untreated controls, whereas, as expected, dasatinib
(15 mg/kg) resulted in marked reduction in SrcY418 phosphorylation but not Src expression (Fig. 6A).
Finally, we examined stable established oxaliplatin-resistant
cell lines derived from HT29 and KM12-L4 (20). After growth in
oxaliplatin-free serum for 48 h, the HT29/OxR and KM12-L4/OxR
cell lines showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in phospho-SrcY418, with
little effect on total Src, compared with the cognate parental
oxaliplatin-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 6B). These data show that stable

Src activation results from chronic exposure to oxaliplatin and is
associated with an oxaliplatin-resistant phenotype.

Discussion
Despite advances in the development of new chemotherapeutic
agents, colorectal cancers eventually develop chemoresistance,
resulting in disease progression. Thus, therapeutic strategies that
would resensitize tumors to these agents would improve outcome.
In this report, we show that one mediator of oxaliplatin sensitivity/
resistance in some colon tumor cells is the nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase Src. Progressive increases in Src activity are a hallmark of
colorectal cancer (9, 37). Numerous physiologic stresses lead to
increased Src activity, including tumor hypoxia and oxidative
stress. In turn, increased Src activity increases cellular migration,
invasion, and expression of proangiogenic factors such as VEGF
and interleukin-8 (24). Thus, Src inhibitors have generated interest

for treatment of patients with colorectal carcinomas (7). Understanding mechanisms by which Src activation affects current
therapeutic regimens is critical if Src family kinase inhibitors are to
become part of the standard therapeutic arsenal in some advanced
colorectal cancer patients.
Herein, we show novel relationships between Src activity and
oxaliplatin administration. Src is activated after oxaliplatin
administration through a ROS-dependent mechanism with a
strong trend toward a correlation between the degree of Src
activation after oxaliplatin administration and the degree of
synergy with dasatinib and oxaliplatin. In a murine model of
colorectal cancer liver metastases, the combination reduces the
size of the liver tumors with associated antiangiogenic and
proapoptotic effects. These suggest a novel mechanism for Src
activation following oxaliplatin administration.
Platinum agents affect redox status through generation of ROS
and through formation of covalent adducts with intracellular
thiols. Cisplatin treatment directly results in generation of ROS
possibly through electrons liberated as a direct byproduct of DNA/
platinum adduct formation or through electron leakage from the
mitochondrial respiratory chain (5, 6). Thioredoxin reductase, in
particular, readily forms inactivating platinum-thiol adducts,
depleting the reduced form of thioredoxin (36), although no
change in thioreductase activity was observed in this study,
consistent with a prior report that showed inhibition only at
oxaliplatin concentrations above what are used therapeutically
(36). Platinum agents may affect signal transduction pathways in
addition to the canonical effects on DNA synthesis resulting from
adduct formation (2, 38, 39), which may explain our results.
Previous work showed that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
induce Src activation (40, 41). We show that antioxidants prevent
this, although we cannot preclude additional cellular effects. The
mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress-induced Src activation
are not fully elucidated. Intriguingly, a previous study has shown
that oxidation of the cysteine residues of Src after integrin ligation
results in increased Src activation due to a conformational change
in the enzyme (41, 42). Oxidation may also inactivate the
phosphatase PTPB1B, implicated in activating Src by catalyzing
dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory Y530 (35).
Colon cancer cell fate after chemotherapy-induced oxidative
stress is variable, with some studies showing an additive effect of
antioxidants and chemotherapy (43), whereas other studies show
antagonism when oxaliplatin is combined with NAC or a
superoxide dismutase mimic (3, 44). These studies suggest that
altering the oxidative balance in cells is dependent on multiple
factors and may be difficult to apply to clinical care (3, 45).
Our data imply that the combination of dasatinib and oxaliplatin
will not affect all colon tumor cells, as also shown by others (15).
However, we show that, for the majority of colon tumor cells,
synergistic effects are observed. Understanding what governs these
cell-dependent responses may provide guidance for selection of
appropriate patients for treatment with Src inhibitors.
Another unexpected finding in this study was the increased
ability of the combination to reduce mean microvessel density.
Although Src inhibition decreases VEGF expression, our results
suggest that Src inhibitors in combination therapies may have
additional clinically relevant antiangiogenic properties when
combined with chemotherapeutics. Therefore, the potential benefit
of Src inhibitors may derive not only from the modulation of
intrinsic cellular resistance but also from enhanced effects on the
tumor-associated vasculature.

Figure 6. Chronic Src activation is associated with oxaliplatin exposure and
resistance. A, murine hepatic tumors treated with oxaliplatin have increased
Src activity. HT29 hepatic tumors were harvested 3 days after last oxaliplatin
treatment. Tumor lysates were immunoprecipitated for total Src and then
immunoblotted for total and phospho-Src. Total Src (top band ) has a molecular
weight close to the IgG heavy chain (HC ; bottom band), resulting in two bands
on Western blot. Phospho-Src is increased in hepatic tumors from mice treated
with oxaliplatin alone. Densitometry indicates ratio of phospho-Src to actin,
normalized to untreated tumors. B, activation of Src in oxaliplatin-resistant
cell lines. Expression by Western blot of total Src and phospho-Src in stable
oxaliplatin-resistant (OxR ) cell lines relative to sensitive parental cells. Cells were
removed from oxaliplatin for 48 h before lysis. Densitometry indicates ratio of
phospho-Src to total Src relative to the same ratio in the respective parental
cell line and is representative of replicated blots.

In murine models, Src inhibitors most commonly affect
properties associated with metastasis, without significant effect
on proliferation. In a clinical trial in colorectal cancer from our
institution, the Src inhibitor AZD0530 failed to show efficacy as a
single agent (46). However, preliminary results from an ongoing trial
in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer suggest activity when a
Src inhibitor is combined with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen
(47). Given preclinical studies showing the ability of Src inhibitors to
overcome chemoresistance as well as resistance to ‘‘targeted’’
agents, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal
antibody cetuximab (16–18, 48), this same approach may be broadly
applicable to other combinations in alternate tumor types.
