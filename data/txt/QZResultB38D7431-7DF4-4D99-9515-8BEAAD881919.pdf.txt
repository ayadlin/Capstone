BACKGROUND. Approximately 25% of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma
develop hepatic involvement during the course of their disease that further
affects their survival. Systemic paclitaxel is safe and has demonstrated good antitumor activity against breast carcinoma. The objective of this prospective study
was to determine the safety and antitumor activity of hepatic intra-arterial paclitaxel therapy.

METHODS. Ten patients with breast carcinoma and dominant liver metastases
received monthly, inpatient, 24-hour, continuous hepatic infusions of paclitaxel
at 200 mg/m2 through an intra-arterial catheter, which was placed using a percutaneous transfemoral approach.

RESULTS. The mean patient age at the time of treatment was 51 years. Fifty-six
courses of paclitaxel were delivered. The most common treatment-related toxicities were leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. No procedure-related complications were observed. Three patients (30%) attained partial responses that
lasted for 6 months, 7 months, and 48 months; and 4 other patients had stable

pproximately 25% of patients with metastatic breast cancer develop liver involvement, which substantially may decrease their
survival.1 Among patients with hepatic involvement, those with hormone receptor-positive tumors usually live longer than those with
hormone receptor-negative tumors (median survival, 11 months and
4 months, respectively).2
Regional hepatic arterial therapy theoretically is an attractive
alternative to systemic approaches for breast cancer patients who
have liver involvement and a lack of hormone receptor expression or
for patients who have large liver metastasis and minor extrahepatic

tumor involvement. Approximately 80% of the blood
supply to liver metastases derives from the hepatic artery,3 and direct tumor infusions, compared with systemic approaches, result in higher drug concentrations,
potentially overcoming tumor resistance.4 Furthermore, the high hepatic extraction rate for some drugs
may result in a better systemic toxicity profile while
increasing exposure of the tumor bed to the drug.
The use of paclitaxel in hepatic infusions is particularly attractive because of its known antitumor
activity against breast carcinoma5 and its suitable
pharmacologic properties.6 Systemic administration
of paclitaxel alone is effective as first- and secondline therapy for metastatic breast cancer,7 with overall response rates ranging between 21% and 62%.8–10
The cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel is related directly
to its plasma concentration,11 and its administration
directly into the hepatic artery results in a 95% mean
extraction by the liver during the infusion and a 61%
mean extraction from 5 to 9 hours after completion
of the infusion.6 In addition, substantial antitumor
activity was observed in a small series of patients
with breast and gastric carcinomas who received hepatic intra-arterial infusions (HAIs) of paclitaxel.12–14
We conducted a pilot study to determine the toxic
effects and antitumor activity of monthly, 24-hour
HAIs of paclitaxel in patients with breast carcinoma
metastatic to the liver.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between February 2000 and November 2002, 10
women with chemotherapy-refractory breast carcinoma and predominant liver involvement were enrolled in a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety
and antitumor activity of HAI paclitaxel. The clinical
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. All study participants provided written informed consent prior to therapy.
Eligible study participants met the following inclusion criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 115; normal organ function,
including a total bilirubin concentration 1.0 mg/dL
and a serum creatinine concentration 1.5 mg/dL;
prothrombin time <13 seconds and activated partial
thromboplastin time <30 seconds; and a normal complete blood count (CBC). Patients with evidence of
portal hypertension, thrombosis, or secondary ascites
were excluded from the study. One patient provided
written consent and was treated and monitored in this
cohort but was not registered because she had Gilbert

2191

syndrome and a total bilirubin concentration >1.0
mg/dL.

Treatment
All patients underwent angiographic placement of a
catheter for HAI. A 3-French microcatheter was
placed into the appropriate hepatic branch through a
5-French catheter inserted into the right common femoral artery. A nuclear medicine catheter flow study
was performed on all patients using 5-mCi technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin particles to
demonstrate the flow distribution within the liver
and to exclude the presence of extrahepatic flow to
prevent gastrointestinal complications. Then, paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) was administered by 24-hour continuous HAI in the inpatient unit. To prevent
hypersensitivity reactions, we administered 10 mg of
intravenous (IV) dexamethasone, 50 mg of IV diphenhydramine, and 300 mg of IV cimetidine 30 minutes
before each infusion. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks until tumor progression, withdrawal of
consent, or life-threatening toxic effects occurred,
such as fulminant hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, or other greater than grade 3 toxicities.
Patient Evaluations During Treatment
The baseline evaluation included a complete medical
history, toxicity assessment, physical examination,
and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan
with and without injection of contrast material. Laboratory analysis included a CBC, coagulation profile,
and measurements of serum tumor markers (CA2729, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and CA125),
serum electrolytes, uric acid, total bilirubin, serum
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate and alanine
aminotransferases, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH),
blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. Before
the second course and each subsequent course of
therapy, patients were evaluated with CBCs, liver and
renal function tests, and tumor marker measurements. Abdominal CT scans were obtained after
every 2 courses of therapy except in patients who had
consistent decreases in LDH and/or tumor marker
levels; in such instances, abdominal CT scans were
obtained only when those levels had reached their
nadir, as determined by the principal investigator.
Response Criteria
Our assessment of clinical responses adhered to the
World Health Organization tumor assessment guidelines.15 A complete response was defined as the total
disappearance of all areas of tumor involvement confirmed by abdominal CT scans and normalization of

all liver function test results. A partial response was
defined as a reduction 50% in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular dimensions of all
selected measurable lesions. Progression of disease
was defined as an increase 25% in the sum of the
products of the greatest perpendicular dimensions of
all measurable lesions. Participation was ended if
disease progression (confirmed by abdominal CT
scan) or unacceptable toxic effects occurred or when
the patient declined further treatment.

Toxicity Assessment
Toxic effects were assessed at patient entry (baseline)
and during each inpatient hospital stay according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria guidelines, version 2.0. CBCs, liver function
studies, and serum electrolyte measurements were
obtained once between monthly treatments.

RESULTS
Patients
All 10 patients were women who ranged in age from
39 years to 60 years (mean age, 51 years; median
age, 45 years). Table 1 summarizes their disease characteristics and prior treatments. Overall, the group
had received a median of 4 previous systemic treatment regimens, including adjuvant regimens and
therapies for metastatic disease; and 8 patients previously had received systemic taxane either alone or
in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Taxanes

had been administered to 4 patients as adjuvant
therapy and to 4 patients in the metastatic setting.

Treatment
In total, 56 infusions were delivered during the study
period. The median hospital admission time for all
patients during the 56 courses was 3 days (range, 2–
16 days; 3 days in 53 of the courses). A prolonged
hospital stay occurred in 1 patient who had rapid
progression of her disease after therapy.
Toxic Effects
Table 2 lists the most common toxicities. Leukopenia
was the most commonly observed side effect, occurring in 8 (14%) of the 56 treatment courses delivered.
Three of those episodes were severe (grade 3 or 4).
The next most common treatment-related toxicity
was grade 1 nausea and vomiting, which also was
reported in 8 (14%) of the 56 courses administered.
Otherwise, patients tolerated the procedure and therapy well, without significant side effects. There were
no catheter-related complications or hypersensitivity
reactions to paclitaxel.
Response and Outcome
Two patients experienced rapid disease progression
after 1 course of therapy, and 2 other patients developed tumor progression after the third and fifth infusions, respectively. Both patients had marked
progression in the liver (50% increase), and extrahepatic progression developed in 1 of them.
The mean time from initiation of therapy to
tumor progression was 5.7 months. The mean duration of antitumor responses for the 3 patients who
attained a partial response was 7.6 months. All patients
eventually developed tumor progression in the liver,
and 2 patients also experienced progression at extrahepatic sites. All 3 patients who attained partial
responses had received prior systemic paclitaxel, and
2 of them received it in the adjuvant setting in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.
However, because of the limited number of patients,

Hepatic Arterial Paclitaxel in Breast CA/Camacho et al.

an association between previous taxane exposure and
clinical benefit was not observed. Table 3 provides
details on antitumor activity. Below, we describe the 3
patients who attained partial antitumor responses
during therapy.
Patient 2 developed liver metastases 1 year after
completing adjuvant radiation for an estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, Her2/neu-negative, T2N3M0 infiltrating ductal
carcinoma of the left breast. Adjuvant therapy had
included paclitaxel. Baseline CT scans demonstrated
bilobar liver disease. The CA27-29 level was 446.8 U/
mL, the CEA level was 19.7 ng/mL, and the CA125
level was 95.3 U/mL. After 9 courses of therapy, a
90% reduction in the hepatic tumor burden was confirmed along with a decline in the serum CA27-29
level to 47 U/mL and normalization of the serum
CEA and CA125 levels. The patient discontinued
therapy and remained free of disease progression for
3 months until CT scans demonstrated progression
of bilobar lesions and a substantial increase in the
serum tumor marker levels was recorded. Subsequently, she received 4 courses of HAI paclitaxel outside the protocol, and tumor regression occurred at
each site in the liver. She was given a second break
from therapy for 6 months and then 4 more therapy
courses until definitive disease progression occurred
after the last infusion.
Patient 6 initially was diagnosed with an infiltrating ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2/neu-negative carcinoma of the left breast in 1996. Initial therapy
included 6 courses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Three years later, a chest wall
recurrence developed, and a complete excision was
performed followed by 4 courses of paclitaxel and
external beam radiotherapy. Approximately 7 months
later, liver involvement was documented. The patient
enrolled in our study and received a total of 6
courses of HAI paclitaxel. Almost complete disappearance of the lesions was attained at the end of
therapy. Subsequently, she underwent tamoxifen
therapy for 1 year, after which, the lesions were
excised. One of the lesions was sterile, and the second was consistent with metastatic carcinoma. The
patient remained disease free for 4 more years and
currently is receiving systemic palliative therapy for
tumor recurrence.
Patient 10 was diagnosed with bilobar liver
metastases 3.5 years after initial treatment of an ERnegative, PR-negative, Her2/neu-negative, T1N1M0
invasive ductal carcinoma in 1998. Soon after HAI
therapy with paclitaxel was started, the patient
attained a partial response, which lasted for 8 consecutive cycles, at which time, disease progression in

2193

the liver was noted (Fig. 1). The patient currently
remains alive and is receiving other forms of regional
therapy. No residual toxicities were reported, and the
disease has remained confined to the liver.

DISCUSSION
The results of our study suggest that 24-hour HAIs of
paclitaxel given monthly to patients with breast carcinoma metastatic to the liver are tolerated well and
result in substantial antitumor activity. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were grade 1 and 2
leukopenia and grade 1 nausea and vomiting. There
was 1 episode of grade 4 neutropenia in a patient
who had received extensive prior cytotoxic therapy.
Hence, the toxicities observed with our regimen were
minimal and were in line with those observed after
systemic IV administration of this agent.16
Previous studies of regional HAIs using vinblastine17 and cisplatin18 resulted in objective antitumor
responses of 36% and 19%, respectively, among
patients with breast carcinoma metastatic to the
liver. However, when the 2 agents were combined,
their substantial antitumor activity was compromised
by excessive toxicity.19
All 3 patients in our study who attained a partial
response had received previous treatment with taxanes
either in the adjuvant setting or to treat recurrence of
their breast carcinoma. It has been demonstrated that
high doses and/or prolonged exposure of the tumor to
paclitaxel may overcome resistance to the drug20; thus,
as also demonstrated in preclinical tumor models,
increased exposure (hour, dose, and duration) of the
tumor bed to paclitaxel by the 24-hour IA route of
administration may overcome tumor resistance and
confer a clinical advantage over the IV route while
minimizing systemic toxicities.
The liver, as a site of dominant metastatic disease, is a well-recognized, critical factor of poor
prognosis (short survival) among patients with either
colorectal or breast carcinoma. The proof of principle
using liver-directed IA chemotherapy as a modality
superior to the systemic IV route in colorectal cancer
recently was demonstrated by Kemeny et al.21 A
recent update of that study with median follow-up of
10 years22 indicated not only that the median survival was significantly longer for the IA group compared with the IV group but that the 10-year survival
was 41% for the IA group and 27% for the IV group,
emphasizing the long-lasting effect of the IA route.
The efforts in the same therapeutic direction
continue with the emergence of new, more effective
agents, such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin, either as IV
adjuncts to the IA 5-fluoro-20 -deoxuidine deoxyuridine

(5FUDR) with ever higher tumor responses reaching
90%,23 or as agents delivered IA per se replacing
5FUDR altogether.24–26
Tumor responses to IA chemotherapy sometimes
can be dramatic and may render patients candidates
for liver resection with curative intent. Ducreux et al.
described this phenomenon in 5 of 26 patients with
colorectal carcinoma after they received IA oxaliplatin.25 One of our patients with breast carcinoma
(Patient 6) underwent liver resection with curative
intent, which resulted in a 4-year disease-free interval before her tumor reoccurred in the liver.
The recent experience with regional intraperitoneal paclitaxel in patients with ovarian carcinoma
demonstrated significant survival advantage compared with IV (systemic) paclitaxel.27 Although this
may be encouraging news, further studies will be
needed to document whether a similar advantage
may be conferred with regional, IA paclitaxel administration to women suffering from breast carcinoma
and dominant liver metastases.
