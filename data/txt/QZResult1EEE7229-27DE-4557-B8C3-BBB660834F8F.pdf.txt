Abstract
Reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes by 5azacytidine (Vidaza) and its congener 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
(decitabine) has provided an alternate approach to cancer
therapy. We have shown previously that these drugs selectively
and rapidly induce degradation of the maintenance DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 by a proteasomal pathway.
Because the toxicity of these compounds is largely due to
their incorporation into DNA, it is critical to explore novel,
nonnucleoside compounds that can effectively reactivate
the silenced genes. Here, we report that a quinoline-based
compound, designated SGI-1027, inhibits the activity of
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B as well M. Sss I with
comparable IC50 (6-13 Mmol/L) by competing with S-adenosylmethionine in the methylation reaction. Treatment of
different cancer cell lines with SGI-1027 resulted in selective
degradation of DNMT1 with minimal or no effects on DNMT3A
and DNMT3B. At a concentration of 2.5 to 5 Mmol/L (similar to
that of decitabine), complete degradation of DNMT1 protein
was achieved within 24 h without significantly affecting its
mRNA level. MG132 blocked SGI-1027–induced depletion of
DNMT1, indicating the involvement of proteasomal pathway.
Prolonged treatment of RKO cells with SGI-1027 led to
demethylation and reexpression of the silenced tumor
suppressor genes P16, MLH1, and TIMP3. Further, this
compound did not exhibit significant toxicity in a rat
hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line. This study provides a novel class
of DNA hypomethylating agents that have the potential for use
in epigenetic cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4277–85]

Introduction
Methylation of DNA at C-5 of cytosine is the most striking
modification of the mammalian genome (1). DNA methylation
plays a key role in mammalian development and can result in Xchromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing proviral elements and retrotransposons (2). Cancer cells exhibit global
hypomethylation as well as localized hypermethylation of genes,
particularly those encoding tumor suppressors (3). Hypermethyla-

tion of many cancer-causing genes occurs in the CpG islands of
the promoter that leads to recruitment of corepressors, altered
chromatin structure, and ultimately transcriptional silencing (4).
The link between genomic methylation and the progression of
cancer has been a subject of intense study. Unlike altered
expression of genes due to specific mutations that can permanently
turn off the genes, promoter methylation is a reversible process.
The genes silenced due to methylation can therefore be reexpressed by DNA hypomethylating agents. This concept provided
the impetus to search for drugs that hypomethylate the genes. The
important components in mammalian methylation machinery are
DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and methyl CpG-binding proteins, which recognize methyl cytosine residues and recruit
transcriptional repressor complexes including histone deacetylases
(HDAC). Two prominent classes of drugs used in reactivating
epigenetically silenced genes include those that inhibit DNMTs
and HDACs. DNMT1 is the major enzyme responsible for the
maintenance of DNA methylation patterns during replication (5, 6).
Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) by inhibiting
DNMT1 has become a promising strategy for cancer therapy (2).
Several DNA hypomethylating agents are currently being evaluated
in preclinical and clinical studies. The commonly used DNA
demethylating agents include cytidine or deoxycytidine analogues,
such as 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-azadC), 1h-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-azacytosine, and dihydro-5-azacytosine (7).
Currently, 5-azaC (Vidaza) and its congener 5-azadC (decitabine or
Dacogen) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndromes. There is a growing list
of DNA methylation inhibitors in addition to 5-azaC and 5-azadC
(7, 8), which includes 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxycytidine, zebularine, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, mitoxantrone, psammaplin A,
procaine, N-acetylprocainamide, procainamide, hydralazine, and
(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (9–11). Recently, a dinucleotide SGI110 (previously called S110) containing 5-azaCdR moiety has been
found to be very effective in inhibiting DNA methylation, but its
stability and cytotoxicity is comparable with that of decitabine (12).
This compound could be used for effective delivery and cellular
uptake of nucleotide drugs, as it is resistant to cytidine deaminase.
Most of the DNA hypomethylating agents reported thus far have
serious drawbacks that include instability and relatively high
toxicity due to their incorporation into DNA or into both DNA and
RNA. Here, we used a new class of relatively stable, highly lipophilic
quinoline-based (monoquaternary pyridinium analogue) smallmolecule inhibitors of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. One of
these compounds that does not bind to the RNA or the minor
groove of DNA was able to inhibit DNMT activity, induce
degradation of DNMT1, and reactivate TSGs.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of SGI-1027. SGI-1027 (previously called S-1027) is a
quinoline-based compound (Fig. 1) that was synthesized in a five-step
reaction, resulting in an overall yield of 17%. Reaction of 4-nitroaniline and
2-amino-4-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine gave 6-methyl-N 4-(4-nitrophenyl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, which was reduced (Fe/C2H4O2) to the corresponding
amine. This was coupled with 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride followed by reduction
(Fe/HCl) to the amine. Reaction of this compound with 4-chloroquinoline
yielded [N-(4-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino)phenyl)-4-(quinolin-4ylamino) benzamide], designated SGI-1027, is an amorphous yellow solid
with a melting point >280jC. High-performance liquid chromatography
(reverse-phase C18, UV detection) showed a purity of 99.4%. The structures
of the intermediates and the end product were confirmed by mass
spectroscopy and by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The structure
of SGI-1027 is presented in Fig. 1.
Solubility of SGI-1027. A 20 mmol/L stock solution of SGI-1027 was
prepared in DMSO, which was used to prepare 0.2 mmol/L stock solutions.
Both 20 and 0.2 mmol/L stocks were used to prepare dosing solutions of 0,
1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 300 Amol/L in culture medium. The final
concentrations of DMSO in the 0 to 100 and 300 Amol/L dosing solutions
were 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The solubility of SGI-1027 was determined
using a light scattering technique and a Nephaloskan instrument after
mixing appropriate amount of the compound with complete medium
containing 10% bovine serum and 10% calf serum at 37jC. A reading that
was greater than or equal to three times background was considered the
limit of solubility.
DNMT (CpG methyltransferase) assay. DNA methylase activity was
assayed by measuring the incorporation of 3H1-methyl group from Sadenosylmethionine (Ado-Met) into DNA using DE-81 ion exchange filter
binding assay (13) with some modifications. The details are provided in
Supplementary Data.
Purification of recombinant Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Full-length
mouse Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were expressed as glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-tagged protein and purified through glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose
column (14).
In vitro methylation assay of P16 promoter with or without inhibitors
was done as described (15).
Reactivation of TSGs TIMP3, MLH1, and P16. Twenty-four hours after
seeding into 60 mm dish, RKO (human colon cancer) cells were treated with
SGI-1027 (dissolved in DMSO) or decitabine each at 1.0 and 2.5 Amol/L
concentration. Parallel control cells were treated with respective vehicles
(DMSO or water). Cells were harvested at different time points ranging from
5 to 7 days. During the entire period of treatment, the media and the drugs
were changed on alternate days. At 70% to 80% confluency, the cells were
split into fresh plates at f30% to 35% confluency for subsequent treatment.
RNA was isolated from the cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated
with DNase I, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was done
using cDNA-specific primers. The primer sequences are provided in
Supplementary Data. h-Actin was used as control for normalization. The

PCR products separated on an agarose gel (1.5%) and stained with ethidium
bromide were quantified with the Kodak imaging software.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis. Real-time RT-PCR for DNMT1, DNMT3A,
DNMT3B, and TIMP3 was done with cDNA synthesized from total RNAs of
control and drug-treated cells as described (16). The primer sequences are
provided in Supplementary Data.
Bisulfite conversion, methylation-specific PCR, and COBRA. Isolation of genomic DNA and treatment with sodium bisulfite were done
according to protocols optimized in our laboratory (17–20). The
methylation-specific PCR for P16 and TIMP3 was done using the primers
and conditions as described by Herman and colleagues (21) and Bachman
and colleagues (22), respectively. COBRA was done with the bisulfiteconverted genomic DNA for TIMP3 as described (20). The primers used are
provided in Supplementary Method.
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. DNA isolated from control
and SGI-1027–treated cells were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis
following standard validated method (23).
Antibodies. Anti-DNMT1 (sc-10222), anti-TIMP3 (sc-6836), anti-P16
(sc-1661), and anti-GAPDH (MAB374) antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology and Chemicon International, respectively. Anti-DNMT3A
and anti-DNMT3B antibodies were raised in our laboratory as described
(14, 24).
Cell culture and treatment with SGI-1027. Human colon carcinoma
cell lines (HCT116 and RKO) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines
(Hep3B) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and
cultured in MEM-a according to the supplier’s protocol. Human cervical
cancer cell line HeLa, breast cancer cell line MCF7, and prostate cancer cell
line LNCaP were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and
cultured in DMEM and RPMI, respectively. Exponentially growing cells were
treated with SGI-1027 or DMSO (vehicle) at indicated concentrations for
different periods. Control cells received DMSO only.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell extracts were immunoblotted with
anti-DNMT1, anti-DNMT3A, anti-DNMT3B, anti-TIMP3, anti-P16, or antiGAPDH antibodies. The signal was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) after incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies.
Proteasomal degradation of DNMT1. The proteasomal degradation
was done as described (16).
Toxicity screening using the rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line. Rat
hepatoma H4IIE cells were used as the test system. These cells were grown
in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and calf serum
(10%). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and after 48 h exposed to SGI1027 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 Amol/L. The solubility was
determined by Nephalometry techniques immediately after dosing and
before harvesting the cells at 24 h. Following the exposure period, the cells
or their supernatant (culture medium) were analyzed for changes in cell
proliferation (propidium iodide), membrane leakage (a-GST), mitochondrial function [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
and cellular ATP], oxidative stress (intracellular GSH and 8-isoprostane),
and apoptosis (caspase-3; ref. 25). The half-maximal toxic concentration
(TC50) was determined from the dose-response curves.

A new class of nonnucleoside DNA hypomethylating agents.
Although 5-azaC and 5-azadC have been used for nearly 25 years as
DNA hypomethylating agents in experimental systems and more
recently for treating some cancer patients, their relative instability
and toxicity due to incorporation into DNA have limited their
clinical applications. To circumvent this problem, we initiated the
synthesis of a new class of quinoline-based compounds that are not
incorporated into DNA and exhibit the characteristics of DNA
hypomethylating agents. Quinolinium bisquaternary salts related
to SGI-1027 are known to bind reversibly in the minor groove of
DNA as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance (26) and X-ray
crystallographic (27) studies. The bisquaternary salts were
originally developed as anticancer drugs (28), with the quaternary

A Novel Nonnucleoside Inhibitor of DNA Methyltransferase

functions critical for their activity and tight DNA binding of these
compounds, but their mechanism of action was not defined. The
nonquaternized, weakly basic compound SGI-1027 also binds
reversibly but much less strongly to DNA [IC50 0.51 Amol/L for
binding to poly(dA-dT) determined by fluorescence quenching
assay] and is indefinitely stable in aqueous solution. It is highly
lipophilic (C log of 5.93; calculated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 9.0) and
has a low polar surface area of 116 (calculated by ChemBioDraw
Ultra 9.0) indicative of good distribution and cell uptake abilities.
SGI-1027 exhibits poor solubility and excellent stability in rat and
human plasma and microsomes (at 1 Amol/L).
SGI-1027 inhibits DNMT activity. At the outset, we tested if
SGI-1027 can inhibit the activity of bacterial M. SssI (which
methylates CpG dinucleotides robustly) and mammalian DNMTs.
All these enzymes have conserved P-Q-E at COOH terminus

involved in catalysis (29). For this purpose, CpG methylase activity
of several DNMTs was measured in the presence of varying
concentrations of the inhibitor. DNMTase activity of all three
enzymes was significantly inhibited by SGI-1027 (Fig. 2). There was
a linear decrease in M. SssI activity with increasing concentrations
of the drug (Fig. 2A). IC50 value ranged from 13.5 to 16 Amol/L
when Ado-Met was used at a concentration of 75 or 150 nmol/L,
with poly(dI-dC) as substrate. The inhibitory effect of SGI-1027 on
mammalian DNMTs was even more prominent (IC50, 6-12.5 Amol/L;
Fig. 2B ), displaying comparable inhibitory activity toward
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Further, the activities of
endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b purified from mouse lymphosarcoma cells (14, 30) were also reduced to similar extent as the
recombinant enzymes (data not shown). Notably, DNMT1 activity
was also diminished to a comparable level with hemimethylated

DNA (24) as the substrate (Fig. 2B). As expected, decitabine did not
curtail the enzyme activity even at the highest concentration used
(100 Amol/L; Fig. 2A).
To elucidate the mechanism of SGI-1027 inhibition, we
measured the enzyme activity with varying concentrations of
either DNA or Ado-Met (see Materials and Methods). SGI-1027
inhibited DNMTase activity by competing with Ado-Met (Fig. 2C)
but not with the substrate DNA. However, plots of 1/V versus 1/S
indicated that V max is decreased by the inhibitor, whereas K m
remained unaltered (data not shown). These data suggest that the
inhibitor is of the noncompetitive type and that SGI-1027 probably
competes with Ado-Met for access to the cofactor binding site of
the enzyme.
We next tested whether SGI-1027 could inhibit methylation of a
1,020 bp fragment of human P16 promoter (see Materials and
Methods for details). Its methylation by CpG methylase resulted in
its resistance to BstU I (a methylation-sensitive enzyme; Fig. 2D,
compare lanes 3 and 2). However, a concentration-dependent
inhibition of P16 promoter methylation was observed with SGI1027 as shown by the increased level of the BstU I-digested
fragments with an IC50 of 16 Amol/L (Fig. 2D). Here again, the
methylation reaction in the presence of decitabine did not generate
any BstU I-cleaved product. These data show that SGI-1027 inhibits

DNA methylation by directly inhibiting DNMTs, whereas decitabine
can act as an inhibitor only after its incorporation into DNA
substrates (31).
SGI-1027 treatment can reactivate silenced TSGs. Many TSGs
are silenced in different cancer cells due to hypermethylation of
CpG islands in their promoters. The TSGs P16, MLH1, and TIMP3
are epigenetically silenced in RKO cells (22, 32, 33). To show that
SGI-1027 indeed resulted in the reexpression of these TSGs silenced
due to promoter methylation, we determined their mRNA levels in
cells treated with the inhibitor for different periods. RT-PCR
analysis showed reexpression of TSGs by both SGI-1027 and
decitabine at comparable levels (Fig. 3). The TIMP3 mRNA elevated
f14- and 9-fold on treatment with 1 Amol/L SGI-1027 and
decitabine, respectively (Fig. 3A). Treatment with SGI-1027 or
decitabine for longer periods did not further increase TIMP3
expression (data not presented). Reactivation of P16 and MLH1
was obvious after 7 days of exposure to SGI-1027 or decitabine
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, SGI-1027 was superior to decitabine with
respect to its ability to reexpress both genes after 7 days of treatment (Fig. 3C). P16 expression increased 2- and 3.5-fold after
treatment with 1 Amol/L decitabine and SGI-1027, respectively.
Treatment with 2.5 Amol/L decitabine and SGI-1027 resulted in
4- and 8-fold increase in P16 mRNA, respectively.

A Novel Nonnucleoside Inhibitor of DNA Methyltransferase

amplified with primers specific for methylated or
unmethylated amplicons. A, PCR products with
primers sets used for unmethylated forward (UF )
and reverse (UR1 ) are designated as p16-U-R1 and
unmethylated forward (UF) and reverse (UR2 ) as
designated as p16-U-R2. p16-M-R1 and p16-M-R2
denote amplicons generated using methylated
forward (MF ) and reverse (MR1 ) and MF and MR2,
respectively. B, PCR product with primers used for
unmethylated forward (UF) and reverse (UR ) is
designated TIMP-3-U. TIMP-3-M denotes amplicon
generated using methylated forward (MF ) and

Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA isolated from
RKO cells treated with the drugs was amplified
with primers specific for TIMP3 CpG island without
PCR bias, and PCR product was digested with
restriction enzymes, separated by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis, and visualized by staining with
ethidium bromide.

We also determined the protein levels of TIMP3 and P16 after
treatment with 1 and 2.5 Amol/L of the drugs. TIMP3 protein was
significantly higher in the SGI-1027–treated cells compared with
the decitabine-treated cells, which was consistent with changes in
the mRNA levels (Fig. 3D). Similarly, a dose-dependent increase
in the P16 protein level was observed in cells in response to both
drugs. Importantly, SGI-1027–treated cells exhibited 5-fold increase
in the level of P16 protein compared with that with decitabine.
P16 and TIMP3 CpG islands are demethylated on treatment
of cancer cells with SGI-1027. To determine whether reexpression of the TSGs on prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells
with SGI-1027 was due to demethylation of their CpG islands,
we performed methylation-specific PCR analysis of the P16 and
TIMP3 genes in RKO cells. We analyzed the region of P16 gene
that was shown to be methylated in cancer cells (21). We used two
different reverse primers specific for unmethylated and methylated CpG islands of exon 1 of P16. Only methylated amplicons
were obtained in untreated RKO cells (Fig. 4A). Substantial
amplification of unmethylated CpG island on treatment with SGI1027 indicates demethylation of the CpG island in P16 exon 1. As
expected, the methylation-specific primers could generate ampli-

cons after bisulfite treatment only in untreated RKO cells but not
in normal colon (Fig. 4A). The SGI-1027–induced demethylation of
this region was comparable with that obtained with decitabine.
Both drugs facilitated significant demethylation of P16 gene after
treatment for 15 days. A similar protocol was used to establish
demethylation of TIMP3 promoter by SGI-1027. Here again, only
methylation-specific primers could generate amplicon from
untreated RKO cells (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, significant
amplification was observed with the nonmethylation-specific
primers in SGI-1027–treated (5-7 days) cells that was consistent
with that achieved with normal human colon sample (Fig. 4B). To
confirm demethylation of CpG island, we also performed COBRA
of TIMP3 gene. The result showed significantly reduced (f60%)
digestion of the amplicon with Taq I obtained from bisulfitetreated DNA from SGI-1027–treated cells as opposed to its
complete digestion in untreated cells (Fig. 4C). This result coupled
with the RT-PCR data therefore proves that SGI-1027 reactivates
the silenced P16 and TIMP3 genes by demethylation of their
respective CpG islands.
The next obvious question was whether SGI-1027 treatment of
cancer cells caused genome-wide demethylation. To address this

issue, we measured methyl cytosine to cytosine content of genomic
DNA by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However,
methyl cytosine content was not significantly altered in RKO cells
treated with the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S1). This result

shows that SGI-1027 specifically demethylates the CpG islands of
TSGs without global hypomethylation.
Treatment with SGI-1027 results in selective degradation of
DNMT1 in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines. Our earlier

DNMT, induced by decitabine (5-azadC) in human cancer cell lines
(16). We were therefore curious to know whether SGI-1027, which
inhibits the enzyme activity by a different mechanism, can also
induce degradation of DNMT1. We measured DNMT1 levels by
immunoblot analysis of extracts from the HCT116 cells treated
with the drug. Treatment of the cells with 5 Amol/L SGI-1027 for
24 h resulted in f95% depletion of DNMT1, which was comparable
with that achieved with decitabine (Fig. 5A, left). Like decitabine,
SGI-1027 had either no effect or minimal effect on DNMT3A or
DNMT3B protein levels. This result shows that the reversible and
weakly DNA-binding quinoline-based compound selectively induces degradation DNMT1 in human colon cancer cell line, HCT116.
Similar degradation of DNMT1 also occurred in another human
colon cancer cell line RKO (Fig. 5A, right).
To investigate whether SGI-1027 is also effective in other cancer
cell types of different tissue origins, the levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A,
and DNMT3B protein were measured in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HepG2), human cervical cancer (HeLa), prostate cancer (LNCaP),
and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A-D). At
2.5 and 5 Amol/L concentrations, its efficacy was comparable with
that of decitabine (95-98%). At 2.5 Amol/L concentration, DNMT1
was completely degraded in MCF7 and HCC cells, whereas higher
concentrations of the inhibitor were required for complete
depletion of DNMT1 in cervical cancer (HeLa) and prostate cancer
(LNCaP) cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). These results show
that, depending on the cell type, the effective dose of SGI-1027
required for complete degradation of DNMT1 varies. Note that
DNMT3A and 3B levels remained virtually unaltered in all cell types
on exposure to SGI-1027 as observed with decitabine (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary S2).
SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1 is an early event
that occurs via proteasomal pathway. To determine whether
DNMT1 degradation is initiated at an early stage of drug treatment,
we performed Western blot analysis with extracts from the HCT116
cells treated with SGI-1027 for different periods. The results
showed that DNMT1 depletion occurs as early as 6 h of treatment.
DNMT1 level was reduced to f40% at this time point and almost
complete degradation (f90%) was achieved at 24 h (Fig. 5B).
To establish the mechanism of SGI-1027–induced degradation of
DNMT1, we measured mRNA levels of all three DNMTs by real-time
RT-PCR following treatment with the drug. The increase in the
mRNA levels of all three after exposure of cells to 2.5 or 5 Amol/L
SGI-1027 for 24 h (Fig. 5C) shows that SGI-1027–mediated
depletion of DNMT1 (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2) is
not due to altered mRNA expression.
We then tested the possibility that SGI-1027–mediated depletion
of DNMT1 may also be due to rapid degradation of the preformed
DNMT1 protein at the post-translational event as observed with
decitabine (16). For this purpose, DNMT1 level was measured in
cells treated with the potent proteasomal inhibitor MG132 before
exposure to SGI-1027. Under these conditions, the SGI-1027–
induced depletion of DNMT1 was significantly blocked in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). This result proves that
SGI-1027 treatment induces DNMT1 degradation by a proteasomal
pathway. Collectively, the data show that SGI-1027 reactivates TSGs
by inducing promoter hypomethylation by inactivating all three
DNMTases and causing selective degradation of DNMT1, the major
maintenance DNMTase.
SGI-1027 exhibits minimal or no cytotoxic effect in rat
hepatoma cells. To explore the advantages of SGI-1027 over 5-aza

compounds as a DNA hypomethylating agent, we investigated the
antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of SGI-1027 in a metabolically
active rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). On exposure of the cells
to different concentrations of SGI-1027, we analyzed cell proliferation and the level of antioxidant enzyme GST (as a measure of
membrane leakage/toxicity) and mitochondrial function. Cell
proliferation assay showed a linear decrease in cell number with
increasing doses of SGI-1027 exposure (Fig. 6A), indicating its
growth-inhibitory effect in this cell line. However, SGI-1027 exerted

similar growth-inhibitory effects in colon cancer cells (HCT116 and
RKO; data not shown). Again, there was no change in the level of
GST on exposure of the cells to SGI-1027 at any concentration
tested (Fig. 6A). This result further shows that SGI-1027 exerts its
growth-inhibitory effect without showing any cellular membrane
toxicity. The effect of SGI-1027 on the mitochondrial membrane
potential was measured using rhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Rhodamine B distributes across the biological membranes in response to the electrical
transmembrane potential. However, with increasing concentrations
of SGI-1027 up to 20 Amol/L, the limit of its solubility, a less
pronounced decrease in transmembrane potential was noticed
(Fig. 6A). The corresponding linear increase in cellular ATP levels
probably protects the cells from cytotoxicity induced by SGI-1027.
Reduced GSH and related enzymes, such as GSTs (phase II drugmetabolizing enzymes), are important cellular defense against
oxidative stress. To investigate potential induction of oxidative
stress by SGI-1027, we measured the cellular GSH level after 24 h
exposure of the rat hepatoma cells at different concentrations of
the drug. There was a linear increase in cellular GSH level up to
20 Amol/L concentration of SGI-1027 (Fig. 6B). On the other hand,
there was almost no change in the level of GST (Fig. 6A). A minimal
increase in the level of GSH alone probably explains a very low
level oxidative stress induced by SGI-1027, which can be counteracted by GSH only in the absence of its interacting detoxifying
partner GST. In recent years, measurement of 8-isoprostane in
cells and plasma has emerged as one of the ideal markers of oxidative stress (34). There was no change in the level of cellular
8-isoprostane level on exposure to SGI-1027 at any concentration
tested (Fig. 6B). These data further show that SGI-1027 does not
exhibit any cytotoxic effect.
We next examined the potential growth-inhibitory property of
SGI-1027 by inducing apoptosis. Because caspase-3 activation plays
a key role during initiation of apoptosis, we measured cellular
caspase-3 levels after incubation of cells for 24 h with different
concentrations of SGI-1027. There was no change in the level of
caspase-3 up to 20 Amol/L concentration (the limit of solubility of
SGI-1027; Fig. 6C). This result suggests that SGI-1027 does not have
any role in induction of apoptosis.

Discussion
Many TSGs are silenced in different types of cancer due to
promoter methylation (20, 35–38). The reexpression of these genes
with inhibitors of DNMT forms the basis of epigenetic therapy of
cancer (7, 9–11). Although the DNA hypomethylating agents 5-azaC
and 5-azadC and their analogues have been used in cancer therapy,
particularly in the treatment of liquid tumors (41), their instability
in solution and toxicity largely due to their incorporation into DNA
have limited their clinical applications. Additionally, 5-azaC can
also be incorporated into RNA leading to inhibition of protein
synthesis, and both 5-aza compounds can inhibit thymidylate
synthase following their deamination into the respective uridines
and conversion into UMP. In efforts to circumvent the cytotoxicity
of the nucleoside DNMT inhibitors, a few nonnucleoside smallmolecule inhibitors of DNMTs have been developed. Some of these
compounds can directly block the DNMT activity and do not
appear to have the toxicity associated with their incorporation into
DNA. The DNMT inhibitor (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate has been
found to bind and block the active site of human DNMT1 and
reactivate the silenced genes in human cancer cell lines (42). A

disadvantage of this compound is its generation of hydrogen
peroxide, which contributes to its toxicity in human cell lines.
Another nonnucleoside small-molecule inhibitor of DNMT, RG-108,
has been reported to be very effective in inhibiting the catalytic
activity of purified recombinant DNMT by blocking the active site
of the enzyme while exhibiting relatively low toxicity in human
cancer cell lines (15, 43). However, this compound did not induce
degradation of DNMT. Interestingly, two drugs used for other
applications (procaine, a local anesthetic, and procainamide, an
antiarrhythmic drug) exhibit DNA demethylating activity (44). In
addition to the commonly acknowledged toxic effects, relatively
high concentrations of these drugs are required for their
demethylating activities. Further, they are not effective in all cell
lines tested (45). Procaine appears to interfere with DNMTs by
binding strongly to GC-rich DNA (44). Psammaplins were also
reported to inhibit DNMT activity in a cell-free assay system, but
their inhibitory mechanism has not clearly been shown (46). None
of these drugs appear to be promising candidates for epigenetic
therapy of cancer.
We have shown that a novel class of synthetic quinoline-based
nonnucleoside compounds (28) exhibits the potential for demethylation and restoration of normal function of tumor suppressors.
One of these compounds, designated SGI-1027, is able to demethylate and reactivate three different TSGs in human cancer cells.
A unique property of SGI-1027 and probably other compounds in
this class is that, unlike the nucleoside compounds, it is not
incorporated into DNA and yet inhibits DNMT activity. A striking
difference between SGI-1027 and the commonly used DNA
hypomethylating agents 5-azaC or 5-azadC is the direct inhibition
of DNMT of both mammalian and bacterial origin in vitro by
SGI-1027. An unexpected observation is the SGI-1027–induced
rapid proteasomal degradation of DNMT1 in a variety of cancer cell
types as observed for 5-aza compounds (16). Although DNMT1 is
selectively degraded by this mechanism, the inhibition of the
DNMT activity is likely to affect all three DNMTs because the motifs
I and X that fold back to form Ado-Met binding sites are conserved
(47). The degradation of DNMT1 by two structurally unrelated DNA
hypomethylating agents suggests activation of a common signal
transduction pathway(s) in response to these drugs. It is important
to identify the signaling pathway responsible for the DNMT1
degradation and the common mechanism for activating this
pathway, which is beyond the scope of the present study.
It is noteworthy that a comparative study on effects of different
nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors of DNMTs in a variety of
assays (43) showed that, unlike 5-azaC or decitabine, zebularine,
procaine, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and RG108 are not able
to demethylate and reactivate TIMP3. In the present study, SGI1027 displayed significant reactivation of TIMP3 that was
comparable with that observed with decitabine. Similar to RG108
and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, SGI-1027 can inhibit Sss I
methylase and mammalian DNMTases in vitro that is not exhibited
by 5-azaC, decitabine, zebularine, or procaine.
Finally, an alternative approach to epigenetic therapy is to use
a combined regimen of inhibitors of DNMTs and HDACs. The
advantage of this strategy is that a relatively low dose of DNMT
inhibitors can be used to minimize their toxicities and achieve a
synergistic effect on activation of the silenced genes (32, 40, 48).
Although SGI-1027 exhibits minimal toxicity, reducing the levels
of HDAC inhibitors to attain maximal response when combined
with SGI-1027 could emerge as a promising therapeutic approach
to regress tumor growth. Many novel HDAC inhibitors have

been synthesized and tested for their efficacy in transcriptional activation of genes (49). It would be worthwhile to
determine an optimal combination of the promising HDAC
inhibitors and SGI-1027 to achieve maximal expression of the
silenced genes.
