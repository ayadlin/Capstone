ABSTRACT
Esophageal cancer, comprising squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma,
is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Notably, the incidence of
esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased at an alarming rate in the Western world.
Unfortunately, the standard first-line chemo-radiotherapeutic approaches are toxic
and of limited efficacy in the treatment of a significant number of cancer patients.
The molecular analysis of cancer cells has uncovered key genetic and epigenetic
alterations underlying the development and progression of tumors. These discoveries
have paved the way for the emergence of targeted therapy approaches. This review
will highlight recent progress in the development of targeted therapies in esophageal
cancer. This will include a review of drugs targeting receptor tyrosine kinases and
other kinases in esophageal cancer. Additional studies will be required to develop
a rational integration of these targeted agents with respect to histologic types of
esophageal cancer and the optimal selection of cancer patients who would most likely
benefit from targeted therapy. Identification of AURKA and AXL as key molecular
players in esophageal tumorigenesis and drug resistance strongly justifies the
evaluation of the available drugs against these targets in clinical trials.

SCC develops from a premalignant dysplastic lesion that
originates from the native squamous epithelium, whereas
the development of AC is initiated from an intestinal
metaplastic lesion (Barrett’s esophagus, BE) that occurs
in response to GERD [8]. In addition to surgical resection,
the current standard of care for patients with either SCC
or AC is chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) [9], and in combination with other agents such as
oxaliplatin [10] and irinotecan [11]. Unfortunately, the
majority of patients at advanced stages of the disease fail
to benefit from these treatments as the 5-year survival
rate remains < 15% [12], underscoring the critical need
for more effective therapies. Hence, there is an urgent
necessity to identify the underlying molecular alterations
of SCC and AC, and characterize molecular signatures to
distinguish the two types of esophageal cancer. Genomic,
proteomic, and molecular epidemiologic studies have
greatly helped identify potential therapeutic targets that
could eventually overcome the shortcomings of the current

INTRODUCTION
The increasing incidence and poor prognosis of
esophageal cancer represent a major public health problem
worldwide. In 2013, it was estimated that 17,990 new cases
of esophageal cancer will be diagnosed and only 15% of
patients will survive their disease in the United States [1].
This malignancy comprises two major histologic types,
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and esophageal
adenocarcinoma (AC)—together they account for the sixth
leading cause of death in the world [2]. Although in the
last few decades SCC cases have steadily decreased, the
incidence of AC has increased at an alarming rate (> 6-fold)
in the Western world [3]. SCC and AC differ substantially in
their underlying etiology factors and tumorigenesis. While
smoking and alcohol [4], prior head and neck cancer [5],
and human papilloma virus infection [6] are risk factors
in SCC; gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
obesity have been associated with increased risk of AC [7].

standard therapies of esophageal cancer. As part of the
International Cancer Genome Consortium project, Song
and colleagues [13] conducted a comprehensive genomic
analysis of SCC samples and identified several significantly
mutated genes, among which ADAM29 and FAM135B.
These two genes have not been previously described in
SCC. Of note, FAM135B has been characterized as a novel
cancer gene that promotes malignancy of SCC cells [13].
A recent similar study on AC samples revealed many
new significantly mutated genes including DOCK2 and
ELMO1 [14]. Functional analysis indicated that mutations
in ELMO1, found in EAC, significantly enhanced cellular
invasion; this suggests the potential contribution of
RAC1 signaling to Barrett’s tumorigenesis [14]. These
studies provide a foundation for further investigations
to characterize subsets of esophageal cancer that may be
clinically useful for developing more effective therapies.
Based on the current literature, this review summarizes the
targeted therapies in clinical development and proposes
potential novel therapeutic targets in esophageal SCC
and AC.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
an HER family member, is a 170-kDa protein with an
extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane
domain, and a cytosolic tyrosine kinase domain [17].
Epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α
ligands bind and activate the EGFR receptor, followed
by internalization of homodimerized or heterodimerized
(EGFR binding HER-2 or ERBB3) receptors, leading to
autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain and activation of several downstream pro-oncogenic
signaling pathways [18]. Based on its aberrant activation
as a result of gene amplification, overexpression and
mutation, and its association with tumorigenesis and poor
prognosis; EGFR has been targeted by two classes of drugs:
1) anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed at the
extracellular domain of the receptor and 2) small molecule
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Targeting RGFR
with mAbs either as monotherapy or in combination with
conventional chemotherapy has proven its first clinical
success in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, especially
those with wild-type KRAS [19, 20]. EGFR mutations (5–
10%) [21], amplification (20–30%), and overexpression
(30–80%) in human esophageal SCC and AC have provided
the rationale for targeting EGFR in esophageal cancer [22].
This suggests that EGFR amplification and overexpression
rather than mutations drive esophageal cancers. Cetuximab,
which is a humanized mouse EGFR mAb, has been shown to
downregulate EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, inhibit
homodimerization and heterodimerization of EGFR with
HER-2 and downstream signaling in preclinical cell models
of gastro-esophageal cancer [23]. In phase II clinical studies,
cetuximab in combination with standard chemotherapy
regimens significantly improved response rates in patients
with gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer [24] or SCC
[25]. However, cetuximab as a single agent has little clinical
activity in upper gastrointestinal cancers [26]. A recent
randomized phase III clinical study concluded that the
combination of cetuximab with capecitabine and cisplatin
had no additional clinical advantage to chemotherapy alone in
GEJ cancer patients [27]. Nimotuzumab, a humanized EGFR
mAb, in combination with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin
or 5-fluorouracil) has shown good therapeutic response in
patients with SCC [28]. Another EGFR mAb, panitumumab,
has been tested in combination with epirubicin, oxaliplatin
and capecitabine in metastatic GEJ cancer patients in a
randomized phase III clinical trial [29]. The results from
this study indicated that addition of panitumumab to the
chemotherapy does not increase overall survival.
Several TKIs targeting EGFR have been clinically
tested in upper gastrointestinal cancers. In a phase II
study, gefitinib in combination with radiotherapy and
chemotherapy in patients with advanced esophageal
SCC or AC enhanced overall survival [30]. However, in
another phase II clinical trial, gefitinib alone has shown

Targeted therapies for esophageal cancer in
development
During the past two decades, the emerging
understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms
of carcinogenesis that helped identify important molecular
targets led to the development of drugs that target specific
molecular sites for various types of cancer, including
esophageal SCC and AC. These drugs inhibit or interfere
with key molecules or signaling pathways that regulate
cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis,
invasion and metastasis, and inflammation. Recently, some
of these drugs have been clinically tested as monotherapy
or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
on esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction cancers
(Table 1).

Receptor tyrosine kinases
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are the main
mediators that transduce extracellular signals into the
cell to modulate cellular growth and differentiation.
A large body of evidence indicating that the normally
tightly controlled and regulated RTKs in normal cells
are overexpressed, amplified, and mutated, leading to
constitutive activation of RTK signaling, resulting in
deregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis (reviewed
by [15]). Similarly, gain-of-function mutations of RTK
downstream effectors such as RAS, RAF, and PI3K
can promote cancer (reviewed by [16]). Our increasing
knowledge of the mechanisms of uncontrolled RTK
signaling in cancer has provided the rationale for the
development of drugs against RTK signaling components
(Figure 1).

Figure 1: Constitutive activation of receptor and non-receptor protein kinases signaling promotes esophageal and
gastro-esophageal tumorigenesis. Overexpression and/or gene amplification of RTKs, and to a lesser extent gain-of-function

mutations of RTKs, lead to constitutive activation of down-stream signaling, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth, cell survival,
angiogenesis, and ultimately tumorigenesis. Of note, AXL suppresses DNA damage-induced apoptosis through interaction and inhibition
of c-ABL tyrosine kinase in esophageal AC [64]. In addition, AXL has been implicated in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), cancer cell invasion, and drug resistance in many types of malignancies, including those of the breast [68, 90] and lung [72, 91].
Overexpression of AURKA, a serine/threonine kinase, attenuates DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibition
of p53 family members [84, 89]. Furthermore, AURKA has been shown to activate NF-κB signaling, leading to chronic inflammation
and gastric tumorigenesis [92]. Targeted monoclonal antibodies, panitumumab (EGFR), pertuzumab (HER-2), ramucirumab (VEGFR-2),
and onartuzumab (c-MET), are currently being tested in combination with first-line chemotherapies in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal cancers (phase III clinical trials, Table 1). The AXL inhibitor, R428 (BGB324), AURKA inhibitor, MLN8237, have been
investigated in esophageal AC, mostly in pre-clinical studies. However, a limited phase I/II clinical study has tested MLN8237 in patients
with solid tumors including esophageal cancers (results not reported).

very minimal clinical activity in patients with esophageal
SCC/AC and GEJ, suggesting that better patient selection
and combination with chemotherapy regimens may
enhance the clinical outcome [31]. In a phase II clinical
trial, erlotinib (TKI) in combination with concurrent
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with advanced
esophageal carcinomas has significantly improved the
overall clinical response [32]. In a separate phase II study,
erlotinib as a single agent in patients with unresectable or
metastatic GEJ adenocarcinoma has shown some clinical
benefits [33].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER-2), a member of the HER family, is a ­185kDa transmembrane RTK without a known activating
ligand [34]. HER-2 is activated through its dimerization
with other members of the HER family including
EGFR and HER-3 [35], leading to the subsequent
activation of downstream signaling. The fact that HER-2
overexpression and amplification have been associated
with poor prognosis in ovarian and breast cancers [36, 37],
1351

Oncotarget

led to the development and approval of trastuzumab
mAb to target HER-2 in breast tumors [38]. The initial
success of trastuzumab targeted therapy in breast
cancer led to its investigation in other types of ­HER-­
2-overexpressing cancers. Overexpression of HER-2 in
esophageal SCC (23%) and GEJ (22%) adenocarcinomas
have been associated with poor response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and overall poor survival, respectively [39].
In a Japanese clinical study, trastuzumab in combination
with capecitabine/cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin
in patients with advanced GEJ cancer improved overall
survival as compared to chemotherapy alone [40]. In a
randomized phase III study, pertuzumab mAb, which is
directed against HER-2, in combination with trastuzumab,
5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and cisplatin is currently
investigated in patients with HER-2-positive metastatic
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (NCT01774786). In
addition, a randomized phase III clinical trial is currently
ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab
emtansine (T-DM1) compared to standard taxane treatment
in patients with HER-2-positive advanced or metastatic
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (NCT01641939).
Lapatinib (TKI), a small-molecule inhibitor, which
targets both EGFR and HER-2, was effective in patients
with trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer [41]. In a phase
II clinical study, lapatinib alone in patients with EGFRand/or HER-2-overexpressing esophageal AC showed
very minimal clinical benefits [42]. In addition, a phase
I clinical trial is currently ongoing to evaluate lapatinib
in combination with paclitaxel in patients with GEJ
adenocarcinoma (NCT00313599).

folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in patients
with metastatic HER2-negative and MET-positive
gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma (NCT01662869). In
addition, crizotinib, which is a small molecule inhibitor
of c-MET—approved for the treatment of ALK-positive
NSCLC by the FDA, has been shown to be effective in
the treatment of a subset of patients with c-MET-amplified
gastric or esophageal tumors [47]. Another c-MET TKI,
tivantinib, is currently being tested in combination with
chemotherapy (FOLFOX) in patients with GEJ and
gastric adenocarcinoma (NCT01611857). The HGF mAb,
rilotumumab, in combination with chemotherapy (ECX)
has shown some survival benefit in patients with gastric
and GEJ cancers, especially those expressing higher levels
of c-MET [48]. Previous studies showed that acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors was associated with gene
amplification of c-MET in NSCLC [49], suggesting
that combined targeting of EGFR and c-MET could be
beneficial to overcome the onset of drug resistance.

Vascular endothelial growth factor
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
which belongs to the platelet-derived growth factor family,
is the most potent proangiogenic factor that interacts
with its receptors (VEGFR-1, -2, and -3). This will
ultimately lead to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis [50].
Frequent overexpression of VEGF has been associated
with increased microvessel density, tumor invasion and
metastasis, and poor prognosis in many types of cancers
[51]. VEGF is up-regulated in BE and esophageal AC,
and overexpression of VEGF protein has been reported
as a potential negative prognostic marker in esophageal
SCC [51]. Therefore, VEGF may be a potential
therapeutic target in esophageal cancers. In a phase III
study, bevacizumab mAb, which binds to all isoforms of
VEGF and hence prevent its binding to its receptors, in
combination with chemotherapy (irinotecan) improved
the overall response rate and survival of patients with
colorectal carcinoma [52]. A phase II study revealed that
bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan and cisplatin
relatively enhanced the survival and clinical outcome of
patients with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
[53]. Similarly, in a more recent phase II clinical trial, the
combination of bevacizumab with docetaxel, cisplatin,
and fluorouracil improved response rate and survival
as compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with
metastatic GEJ adenocarcinoma [54]. Ramucirumab,
a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to
VEGFR2 and blocks angiogenesis, has been recently
approved by the FDA as second-line therapy for patients
with advanced gastric cancer or GEJ adenocarcinoma [55].
In a randomized phase III trial, ramucirumab monotherapy
has improved survival in patients with advanced gastric or
GEJ adenocarcinoma after first-line chemotherapy [56].
Several TKIs, which inhibit multiple RTKs including

Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
The mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
(c-MET) RTK, consisting of alpha subunit (45 kDa)
and beta subunit (145 kDa), is activated by its ligand
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leading to transduction
of downstream signaling, including PI3K/AKT, mTOR,
and STAT3 pathways [43]. Physiologically, c-MET
promotes cell scattering and motility, which involves
the disruption of cell-cell adhesion—a critical function
in embryogenesis and wound healing [44]. The MET
pathway has been chosen as a promising drug target
because dysregulation of this pathway occurs in various
types of human cancers, including human gastric and
esophageal AC [45]. Several molecular mechanisms
such as ligand/receptor overexpression or c-MET gene
amplification can mediate such dysregulation. Notably,
gene amplification of c-MET has been associated with
poor prognosis in gastric and esophageal cancers [46].
The c-MET and its ligand HGF are potential therapeutic
targets in upper gastrointestinal cancers. For instance, in
a randomized global phase III study, onartuzumab mAb
(MetMAb), which is directed against c-MET receptor, is
currently investigated in combination with 5-fluorouracil,

VEGF receptor, have been investigated. Sunitinib, as a
single agent, has insufficient clinical value in patients with
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma [57]. In addition, sunitinib
is currently investigated in combination with chemotherapy
(FOLFIRI) in patients with gastric and esophageal cancers
(NCT00891878, NCT00524186). Another TKI, sorafenib,
in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin improved
the overall survival in patients with metastatic gastric or
GEJ adenocarcinoma [58]. However, in a phase II study,
sorafenib as a single agent is being investigated in patients
with metastatic or recurrent esophageal SCC and AC, and
GEJ adenocarcinoma (NCT00917462).

that prevent colon tumorigenesis [71]. Therefore, targeting
AXL with the highly specific AXL inhibitors may be a less
risky therapeutic approach than using other inhibitors with
broad range specificity. The fact that AXL is frequently
overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in
esophageal AC strongly suggests that AXL is an attractive
therapeutic target in this human malignancy.
A recent interesting study demonstrated that
activation of AXL kinase mediates resistance to EGFRtargeted therapy in lung cancer [72]. Another study
showed that knockdown of AXL significantly improved
in vitro response to standard chemotherapy by promoting
apoptosis in NSCLC [73]. In this regard, we investigated
the potential role of AXL in promoting resistance to
standard chemotherapeutic agents in esophageal AC.
Indeed, we demonstrated that AXL mediates resistance
to the DNA-damaging drug (cisplatin) through regulation
of c-ABL tyrosine kinase in p53-deficient esophageal
AC cells. Mechanistic investigations showed that AXL
attenuates cisplatin-induced apoptosis through blocking
nuclear accumulation of c-ABL and phosphorylation of
p73 in response to DNA damage (Figure 1) [64]. The
findings from this study and others [65] strongly support
an initiative to evaluate AXL as a therapeutic target in
combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic
agents in esophageal AC in preclinical and clinical
settings. This combination therapeutic approach may be
valuable to overcome the frequent occurrence of drug
resistance in patients with esophageal AC.

AXL
AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs
to the TAM subfamily (Tyro-3, AXL, and Mer), is a
transmembrane protein that consists of extracellular two
immunoglobin-like domains with two tandem fibronectin
type III repeats, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain [59].
AXL binds to its ligand Gas-6 (growth arrest-specific
gene 6) and activates downstream signaling, including
PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways [60]. Following its
identification as a transforming gene in human chronic
myelogenous leukemia [61], AXL has been shown to be
overexpressed in several types of human cancers such
as lung [62] and gastric [63] cancers. Of note, we [64],
and others [65], have reported AXL overexpression in
esophageal AC. In fact, AXL overexpression has been
associated with tumor cell migration and invasion,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and poor
survival in different types of cancers [66, 67]. These
studies highlight AXL as a promising target for cancer
therapy. In this regard, Holland and colleagues [68]
generated and characterized a highly selective smallmolecule inhibitor (R428, Rigel Pharmaceuticals) that
potently blocks the catalytic activity of AXL and AXLdependent biological functions, including tumor cell
invasion and angiogenesis in tumor mouse models. In a
preclinical study, Li and colleagues [69] have developed
AXL monoclonal antibodies that suppress NSCLC
xenograft growth through downregulation of AXL
expression and induction of apoptosis. Preclinical studies
on AXL inhibitor TP-0903 (Tolero Pharmaceuticals &
Astex Pharmaceuticals) in pancreatic and lung cancers
are ongoing [70]. BergenBio & Rigel Pharmaceuticals
have recently launched a clinical trial (phase I) to
evaluate the AXL inhibitor BGB324 (formerly R428) in
cancer patients [70]. In another phase I clinical study, a
compound (S49076, Servier) that inhibits AXL/Mer and
fibroblast growth factor receptors has been evaluated in
patients with advanced solid tumors [70]. However, a new
study urges caution as systemic inhibition of AXL and its
closely related RTK, Mer, could promote colon cancers
[71]. Of note, AXL and Mer are expressed in macrophages
and dendritic cells mediating anti-inflammatory functions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Aurora kinase A
Aurora kinase A (AURKA)—a member of a family
that also includes aurora kinase B and C—is a serine/
threonine kinase, which is crucial for normal mitotic
spindle formation and centrosome maturation and
separation during cell division [74]. AURKA kinase activity
is dependent on the phosphorylation of a threonine residue
(T288) located on the activation loop of the kinase. We, and
others, have previously reported the amplification of the
region band 13, which harbors the AURKA gene, on the long
arm of chromosome 20 (20q13) in upper gastrointestinal
cancers [75, 76]. In addition, the AURKA gene is frequently
amplified and/or overexpressed in several types of cancer
including those of the stomach [77] and esophagus [78].
Notably, AURKA overexpression has been significantly
associated with more advanced stages of cancer and poor
prognosis [79]. Pre-clinical studies showed that activation
of AURKA leads to transformation of rodent fibroblast
cells and the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles that
induce genomic instability [80], establishing AURKA as a
bona fide oncogene. AURKA blocks p53 tumor suppressor
function through direct phosphorylation of p53 at Ser315,
inducing MDM-2 mediated degradation of p53 protein
[81]; and Ser215 to suppress its transcriptional activity in
cancer cells [82]. Additionally, we uncovered that AURKA
1353

Oncotarget

suppresses p53 through regulation of AKT-MDM-2
signaling in gastric cancer cells [83], and attenuates
TAp73 transcriptional activity in p53 deficient cancer cells
(Figure 1) [84]. We [83], and others [85], have reported
that AURKA promotes survival of cancer cells through
increased phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473. Because of
their overexpression and association with tumorigenesis,
aurora kinase family members have become the focus
of drug discovery. Several aurora kinase small molecule
inhibitors have been reviewed by Pollard and colleagues
[86]. An increasing number of these inhibitors have been
developed at preclinical or clinical stages. A secondgeneration investigational AURKA inhibitor (MLN8237/
alisertib, Millennium), which has 200-fold selectivity for
AURKA over AURKB (aurora kinase B) in cell assays,
has been recently investigated as monotherapy in phase
I clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors or
lymphomas (NCT01898078, NCT00962091). Notably, a
phase I/II study on MLN8237 in patients with solid tumors
including esophageal and gastric cancers has just been
completed, yet the results have not been reported to date
(NCT01045421). In preclinical studies, we investigated
whether the combination of MLN8237 with standard
chemotherapeutic agents could have a better therapeutic
outcome in upper gastrointestinal cancers. Indeed, we
found that MLN8237 in combination with cisplatin or
docetaxel significantly enhanced cell death in esophageal
AC xenograft mouse models [87, 88]. Mechanistic
investigations indicated that AURKA promotes resistance
to DNA damaging agents through activation of HDM2,
a negative regulator of p53, thereby confirming that
inhibition of AURKA in combination with chemotherapy
is a good therapeutic approach in upper gastrointestinal
cancers [89]. These results strongly support the initiation
of clinical studies on MLN8237 in combination with
standard chemotherapeutic agents in patients with upper
gastrointestinal cancers. Additional preclinical studies on
combinations of MLN8237 with targeted drugs (listed
above) are required prior to designing clinical trials in
patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers, especially
those who have developed acquired resistance to first-line
chemotherapy.

identification of AURKA and AXL as important players
in esophageal tumorigenesis and drug resistance strongly
justifies evaluating the available drugs targeting these
molecules in clinical trials. As targeted therapy has been
marred by drug resistance, it is imperative to preemptively
identify the underlying molecular mechanisms and
develop strategies to overcome them in a clinical setting.
Notably, development of biomarkers of drug response and
resistance may be useful in future clinical trials and rational
management of cancer patients.

Esophageal cancer is characterized by resistance to
current first-line therapies and dismal clinical outcome,
underscoring the urgent need for more effective and
innovative treatment strategies. Unlike other types of
cancer, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that
regulate esophageal tumorigenesis of both histologic
types has been incomplete. Our understanding of cancer
biology coupled with the development of targeted drugs
will have a positive impact in the treatment of esophageal
cancer. The current ongoing clinical trials of targeted drugs
in esophageal cancer patients have been mostly based on
molecular targets identified in other malignancies. However,
