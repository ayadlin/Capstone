Abstract
The extracellular matrix protein TGFBI enhances the cytotoxic response of cancer cells to paclitaxel by
affecting integrin signals that stabilize microtubules. Extending the implications of this knowledge, we tested the
more general hypothesis that cancer cell signals which increase microtubule stability before exposure to
paclitaxel may increase its ability to stabilize microtubules and thereby enhance its cytotoxicity. Toward this
end, we carried out an siRNA screen to evaluate how genetic depletion affected microtubule stabilization, cell
viability, and apoptosis. High content microscopic analysis was carried out in the absence or presence of
paclitaxel. Kinase knockdowns that stabilized microtubules strongly enhanced the effects of paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, kinase knockdowns that enhanced paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity sensitized cells to
microtubule stabilization by paclitaxel. The siRNA screen identified several genes that have not been linked
previously to microtubule regulation or paclitaxel response. Gene shaving and Bayesian resampling used to
classify these genes suggested three pathways of paclitaxel-induced cell death related to apoptosis and
microtubule stability, apoptosis alone, or neither process. Our results offer a functional classification of the
genetic basis for paclitaxel sensitivity and they support the hypothesis that stabilizing microtubules prior to
therapy could enhance antitumor responses to paclitaxel treatment. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5806–17. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Taxanes (1, 2) are microtubule-stabilizing drugs used in the
standard management of two of the most common solid
tumors, breast and ovarian cancer, in addition to several
other cancers (3, 4). In each of these cancers, only a fraction
of patients will benefit. Understanding mechanisms of
response to primary taxane therapy is an essential step in
developing novel combination therapies that will improve
response rates. Improving response rates to an established
therapy is likely to improve survival outcomes for patients.
The taxane, paclitaxel, binds to specific pockets within
b-tubulin in a/b-tubulin dimers (5), that are incorporated

within preformed microtubule polymers (6, 7). Paclitaxel
binding increases microtubule polymerization and stability
and induces mitotic arrest of cycling cancer cells followed by
apoptosis. Increasing the fraction of unstable microtubules in
the cell by mutations outside the paclitaxel-binding sites (8, 9),
overexpression of b3-tubulin (10, 11) or overexpression of
depolymerizing microtubule-associated proteins (12) results
in a disproportionate increase in free tubulin dimers and a
consequent decrease in paclitaxel binding sites, leading to
profound paclitaxel resistance.
Loss of the extracellular matrix protein TGFBI results in
decreased focal adhesion kinase activation, decreased microtubule stability, and an increase in unstable microtubules
resulting in significant paclitaxel resistance (13). Ovarian
cancers which lack TGFBI are intrinsically resistant to single-agent paclitaxel therapy. Based on these findings we
proposed a model whereby the proportion of baseline stable
microtubules determines the availability of binding sites for
paclitaxel and consequently the magnitude of paclitaxelinduced microtubule stabilization. In this study, we tested
the hypothesis that modulating baseline microtubule stability
by perturbing signaling pathways would alter paclitaxel
response and could be utilized therapeutically.

at 37 C and 5% CO2. Human skin fibroblasts were a kind gift
from Dr Karl Morten. A549 and A549-T12 lung carcinoma cells
were a kind gift from Dr Susan Horwitz. Cell lines were
authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling.
Transient knockdown experiments for the screen were
carried out by transfection using a pool of 4 individual siRNA
duplexes targeting individual genes (siGenome Smart pool,
Dharmacon), or individual duplexes, using Dharmafect 4
(Dharmacon) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
In summary, 0.1 mL of 20 mmol/L siRNA was mixed with 0.1 mL
of Dharmafect 4 and 10 mL of Optimem medium (Invitrogen)
for 20 minutes in a well of 384-well plate and overlaid with 40
mL of cell suspension (1,750 cells) in antibiotic-free cell line–
specific media. This gave a final siRNA concentration of 40
nmol/L per well. The catalogue numbers and sequences of the
siRNAs used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. siControl
nontargeting siRNA number 4 (Dharmacon) was used as a
transfection control in all experiments. Pools of 4 siRNAs
targeting Tau, MAP2, and stathmin were obtained from
Dharmacon (siGenome library).
For the purpose of the screen, the first 3 columns of every
plate were reserved for transfection controls as follows:
siControl, siTOX (Dharmacon) as control for transfection
efficiency and cells only.
Immune-staining microscopy techniques, image
acquisition, and image analysis
SKOv3 ovarian cancer cells were transfected using siRNAs
in individual wells of black 384-well plates (Greiner, 1,750 cells
per well) for 48 hours then either treated with paclitaxel
(Sigma) 8 nmol/L or diluent only then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 3 to 5 minutes. Cells were
washed to remove PFA and were incubated in absolute
ethanol at –20 C for at least 1 hour before being washed with
Tris-buffered saline, 0.04% SDS (Sigma), and 0.2% Triton X-100
(Sigma). Blocking was carried out using 1.5% bovine serum
albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Nuclear DNA was stained
using Hoechst 33258 dye (Invitrogen), and stable microtubules
were revealed by rabbit anti–Glu-tubulin antibody (Millipore)
and counterstained using anti-rabbit tagged with alexa-594
(Invitrogen). Image acquisition was obtained as previously
described using the In Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare; ref.
14). For quantification of a-tubulin intensity, mouse anti–
a-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was counterstained with antimouse antibody tagged with alexa-488.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of data for the screen from individual cells (n ¼ 4
million) was automated using the R programming language
and statistical computing environment. In brief, each cell
analyzed was annotated to individual wells representing a
gene knockdown. Background subtracted mean pixel intensity
values were calculated for each cell, and the mean of all cells
per well was used as an estimate of the magnitude of microtubule stability for each well. The median of triplicate values
was obtained for each gene with and without paclitaxel and
expressed as a percentage of the mean value for microtubule
stability following transfection with nontargeting siRNAs. The

www.aacrjournals.org

values in each plate were centered on 100 using median
scaling. The same method was used for analyzing caspase
and viability data.
Robust siRNA clusters were obtained using bagged gene
shaving (15). We used 256 bootstrap resamples and obtained
each resample first by ranking the individual cells in each
sample, and then applying a weighted ranking across each
siRNA using weights obtained from the Bayesian bootstrap
distribution. Aggregated clusters obtained from the adjacency
matrix were required to contain siRNA with at least 50%
similarity within the cluster.
Cytotoxicity assays
For measuring apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activity was estimated 48 hours following treatment by adding equal volume
of the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay reagent (Promega). Luminescence was read following 1 hour of incubation using a luminescence plate reader. Cell viability was estimated by adding
5 mL of the CellTiter blue Kit reagent (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was measured
4 hours later using a plate reader.
For colony forming assays, SKOv3 cells (2  105 cells/well)
or Hey cells (9  104 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates.
Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected using either
nontargeting siRNA or siRNAs targeting ILK or RAPGEF4 for
48 hours, then cells were reseeded in different 6-well plates at
the density of 250 cells/well for SKOv3 or 200 cells/well for
Hey. After 2 days, cells were treated with paclitaxel 1 nmol/L
for 48 hours and maintained in the corresponding antibioticfree medium for either 7 days (SKOv3 cells) or 4 days (Hey
cells) then fixed and stained using Coomassie Blue and
individual colonies were counted.
For measuring cell kinetics, 5-bromo-20 -deoxy-uridine
incorporation was measured using an ELISA based assay
(Roche Applied Sciences) following the manufacturer's
instructions as a measure of the extent of cell cycling.
Reagents. Paclitaxel and nocodazole were obtained from
Sigma. Antibodies for Tau, MAP2, and stathmin were obtained
from Millipore and for p-STAT3 from Cell Signaling.
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise
indicated.

Results
A hypothesis-driven screen to investigate the influence
of baseline microtubule stability on paclitaxel
cytotoxicity
To test the hypothesis that modulating signaling-induced
microtubule stabilization can directly influence paclitaxelinduced microtubule stabilization and cytotoxicity, we conducted an siRNA screen to identify candidate genes which
upon knockdown enhance paclitaxel-induced microtubule
stability, apoptosis, and cell death. We chose the kinome
library from Dharmacon, as microtubule-associated proteins
are strongly regulated by phosphorylation (16–21). SKOv3
ovarian cancer cells were transfected with either nontargeting
control siRNA or a pool of 4 siRNAs targeting each of the 779
genes included in this library.

Figure 1. A hypothesis-driven screen to investigate the influence of
baseline microtubule stability on paclitaxel cytotoxicity. A, an outline of the
siRNA screens conducted. The 779 siRNA pools used in each screen were
divided into three 384-well plates (320 pools for plates 1 and 2 and 139
pools in plate 3), and 3 replicates were used for each plate with and without
paclitaxel giving a total of 54,384-well plates for the entire experiment. B,
shown in the lower diagonal of each plot are dot plots representing the
correlation between the measures obtained for each pair of the 3 replicates
used in the screen following paclitaxel treatment. The corresponding
Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair is shown in the upper diagonal
of each plot.

To measure microtubule stability in a high-throughput
manner, we carried out triplicate immunofluorescence experiments in 384-well plates using an antidetyrosinated a-tubulin
(also called Glu-tubulin) antibody, a specific marker for stable
microtubules (22, 23), that was counterstained with an alexa594–tagged antibody. Automated image capture was carried
out, followed by automated image analysis to extract background-subtracted mean pixel intensity values from the cytoplasm of individual cells as a measure of microtubule stability.
When microtubule stability was measured following exposure
to increasing concentrations of paclitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S1) the Glu-tubulin–based assay yielded a wide (4.3-fold)
dynamic range compared with the narrower range (2.5-fold) of
a-tubulin–based assays. This difference may relate to the
relatively small fraction of stable microtubules (Glu-tubulin)
in cancer cells compared with total microtubules (a-tubulin)
prior to paclitaxel treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). The use

Figure 2. Baseline microtubule stability strongly correlates with paclitaxelinduced microtubule stabilization. Seven hundred seventy nine siRNA
pools targeting individual genes were used to transfect SKOv3 cells
followed by immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods.
The mean cytoplasmic pixel intensity values for each cell were extracted
and background subtracted using the In-Cell Investigator (GE Healthcare)
software from a total of 64,800 images including a total of approximately 4
million cells. The mean value of all cells in a well, which represent a single
gene, was used to calculate the percentage microtubule stability following
knockdown of a gene compared with the mean value obtained for
nontargeting siRNA-transfected cells. In this plot, each circle represents
the median of triplicate percentage values obtained following siRNA

of automated microscopy and image analysis for individual
cells yielded a consistent and reproducible linear relationship
between paclitaxel dose and microtubule stability (Supplementary Fig. S1) in contrast to the use of other high-throughput methods based on measuring total fluorescence from
individual wells or measuring well luminescence in assays
that utilize peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (data not
shown). To verify the fidelity of the technique in identifying
changes in microtubule stability, we tested the effect of
depletion of the microtubule destabilizing protein stathmin
(12) and the microtubule polymerizing protein MAP2 (24). As
expected, depletion of stathmin resulted in a significant
increase in baseline microtubule stability and paclitaxelinduced microtubule stabilization whereas depletion of
MAP2 resulted in the opposite effect. In addition, depletion
of Tau, which has previously been shown to compete with
paclitaxel for the binding site on b-tubulin (24–26), resulted in
a marked increase in paclitaxel-induced microtubule stabilization (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the above results
were also reproduced by measuring total microtubule polymer
formation by using an antibody for a-tubulin (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Microtubule stability was measured following 1 hour of
paclitaxel treatment as this time point highly correlated

Fold change in cytotoxicity. compared to

Figure 3. Enhanced microtubule stabilization is a significant mechanism
for enhanced paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity. SKOv3 cells were
transfected and treated as described in Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods.
After this, the following parameters were measured: (i) the fold change in
apoptosis or cytotoxicity following siRNA pool transfection alone
compared with nontargeting siRNA (fold no drug), (ii) the fold change in
apoptosis or cytotoxicity following siRNA pool transfection and paclitaxel
compared with nontargeting siRNA transfection and paclitaxel (fold drug
treated), and (iii) the ratio of (ii) over (i). siRNA pools were identified that
either increased the fold drug treated over 2.5 or increased the ratio over 2.
In the figure, each circle represents the median of triplicate values of the
indicated ratio. Data for apoptosis and cell viability is presented in (A) and
(B), respectively. The blue lines indicate the cutoffs used in the screen for
identifying hits. The green circles indicate genes that also enhanced

with cytotoxicity after 48 hours of treatment (Pearson
correlation coefficient ¼ 0.97, P < 0.001; Supplementary
Fig. S3). Later estimation of microtubule stability was less
reproducible because of easier detachment of cells following arrest in mitosis (not shown). In addition to measuring
microtubule stability, we also measured caspase activity
and cell viability with or without paclitaxel treatment. To
avoid the bias introduced by lifting off of mitotic cells when
measuring apoptosis or viability, we utilized assays that did
not require washing of media prior to estimation of cytotoxicity (see Materials and Methods). All three outcome

measures were optimized to maximize their dynamic range.
Our assay development experiments showed that decreasing the proportion of cycling SKOv3 cells significantly
decreases paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and this may
decrease the dynamic range of the cytotoxicity tests and
increase the false negative rate in siRNA experiments
(Supplementary Fig. S4). As transfection itself can decrease
proliferation rate and increase the proportion of noncycling
cells, we conducted detailed assay development experiments to optimize our transfection conditions to avoid
the bias introduced by shifting cell kinetics. We tested
multiple starting cell densities (1,000, 1,250, 1,500, 1,750,
and 2,500 cells per well), 8 transfection reagents, 9 nontargeting siRNAs, and 4 siRNAs that were known to induce
cell death and measured cell viability using CellTiter blue
kit reagent (Promega) following 48 hours of transfection
(Supplementary Fig. S5). These experiments showed that
using 1,750 cells, and Dharmafect 4 transfection reagent
minimized the inhibitory effect of transfection on cell
proliferation when compared with nontransfected cells
and resulted in the least variability across replicates (Supplementary Fig. S5). Apoptosis was measured following
48 hours as this gave a detection range of 9-fold (Supplementary Fig. S6), and viability was measured after 72 hours
as this resulted in a 2.6-fold detection range (Supplementary
Fig. S7A) compared with only 1.6-fold detection range after
48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S7B). A dose of 8 nmol/L of
paclitaxel was chosen to maximize the chance of detecting
sensitizing siRNAs by providing at least an 80% window for
detecting enhanced taxane effects. Using 8 nmol/L of
paclitaxel resulted in only 2-fold increase in microtubule
stability, a 2-fold increase in apoptosis, and a 15% decrease
in cell viability. This dose was also chosen because cytotoxicity measurements tended to plateau at higher concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Thus, 3 kinome screens were conducted in parallel to
measure the effect of siRNA transfections on microtubule
stability, cell viability, and apoptosis with or without paclitaxel
(Fig. 1A). Each of the 3 screens was conducted in triplicate. To
estimate data precision, we measured the mean correlation
coefficients among the 3 replicates for microtubule stability,
cell viability, and apoptosis and found that the average
Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.77, 0.86, and 0.96,
respectively (Fig. 1B). This high reproducibility across replicates is a strong indicator of the high precision of data (27)
obtained in this screen.
Baseline microtubule stability strongly correlates with
paclitaxel-induced microtubule stabilization
To test the hypothesis that increasing baseline microtubule
stability results in enhanced paclitaxel-induced microtubule
stabilization, we calculated the median microtubule stability
values of 3 replicates prior to treatment and correlated this
with the median value following treatment and found a highly
statistically significant positive correlation (Pearson r2 ¼ 0.66,
P < 0.001). This indicated that on a global scale, baseline
microtubule stability predicted taxane-induced microtubule
stabilization (Fig. 2).

its inhibition has been previously reported to enhance
paclitaxel-mediated cell death (31–33).
Measuring microtubule stability identifies three
distinct mechanistic classes for modulating paclitaxelinduced cytotoxicity
We next sought to classify siRNA pools targeting individual
genes according to their similarities in the mechanism of
modulating paclitaxel response. To do this, we first used gene
shaving to obtain classes of genes that behave similarly in
modulating cell viability and apoptosis with or without paclitaxel and paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability (15). We next
used Bayesian resampling to identify classes that were statistically robust to permutation analysis. This method identified
predominantly 3 robust classes of genes (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Tables S4–S6) in which paclitaxel-induced microtubule
stability either (i) significantly correlated with paclitaxelinduced apoptosis (Pearson r2 ¼ 0.5, P < 0.001, n ¼ 208 siRNA
pools, Fig. 4B) and to a lesser extent with paclitaxel-induced loss
of viability (Pearson r2 ¼ –0.2, P < 0.001, n ¼ 208; Fig. 4B), (ii)
significantly correlated with both paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
(Pearson r2 ¼ 0.5, P < 0.001, n ¼ 132 siRNA pools, Fig. 4B) and

www.aacrjournals.org

loss of cell viability (Pearson r2 ¼ –0.7, P < 0.001, n ¼ 132 siRNA
pools, Fig. 4B), or (iii) paradoxically, inversely correlated with
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Pearson r2 ¼ –0.6, P < 0.001,
n ¼ 105 siRNA pools, Fig. 4B) and loss of cell viability (Pearson r2
¼ 0.6, P < 0.001, n ¼ 105 siRNA pools, Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the
latter class was also characterized by a poor correlation
between paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and paclitaxel-induced
loss of cell viability (Pearson r2 ¼ –0.3, Fig. 4B). To explain the
paradoxical inverse correlation between microtubule stability
and apoptosis in the third gene cluster, we tested the hypothesis
that depletion of genes that result in inhibition of apoptosis may
result in resistance to paclitaxel regardless of the effect on
microtubule stability. To test this possibility, we identified all
siRNA pools that resulted in increased paclitaxel-induced
microtubule stabilization and decreased paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis (n ¼ 34). Examination of the known function of
these genes revealed that several of them were either genes with
known critical function in inducing apoptosis or genes that
played a role in recognition of cell damage. For example,
receptor interacting serine threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2, also
known as CARD3) is a known apoptosis inducer (34). Depletion
of RIPK2 resulted in decreased apoptosis irrespective of

paclitaxel administration. Also, loss of the cell-cycle checkpoint
protein ATM (35), resulted in enhanced microtubule stability
but decreased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and improved cell
survival following paclitaxel treatment. We, therefore, reasoned
that loss of these genes may result in a significant decrease in
apoptosis that is independent of paclitaxel effect. Indeed, the
mean normalized apoptosis induction following transfection
with these siRNAs (n ¼ 34) was less than half the mean of the

enhanced cytotoxicity, as detected by measuring cell viability or apoptosis. We measured the effect of knockdown
on microtubule stability and viability with or without
paclitaxel treatment in 384-well plates in triplicates.
Thirty-four out of the 35 genes tested had at least one
siRNA that resulted in a significant increase in microtubule
stability. Twenty-nine genes were validated using at least 2
independent siRNAs (Fig. 5A and B, Table 1). Importantly,
there was a strong positive correlation between baseline
microtubule stability and paclitaxel-induced microtubule
stability following siRNA transfections (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.87, Fig. 5C). We next examined the correlation
between paclitaxel-induced microtubule stabilization and
paclitaxel-induced cell death and found a highly significant
correlation (P < 0.001, Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results
further validate the notion that baseline microtubule
stability is a strong determinant of paclitaxel-mediated

Increasing Microtubule Stability Enhances Taxane Response

microtubule stabilization and identify previously unrecognized roles of a group of genes in modulating microtubule
stability.
Modulating microtubule stability directly influences
microtubule mass and cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer
cell lines
Paclitaxel induces a significant increase in microtubule
stability and in total microtubule mass resulting in the
induction of the characteristic feature of paclitaxel-induced
bundles (36) which perturbs the ability of the cell to form an
organized mitotic spindle. To investigate whether enhanced
paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability also resulted in an
enhanced paclitaxel-induced microtubule polymerization,
we knocked down 7 genes (ILK, FER, RAPGEF4, AATK,
CHEK1, FLT4, and SGK2) using siRNA pools and measured
the effect of knockdown on microtubule stability and total
microtubule mass following paclitaxel treatment at 10 and
100 nmol/L using both a- and Glu-tubulin staining. As
expected, knockdown of each of the 7 genes enhanced
Glu-tubulin formation following paclitaxel treatment at
each of the 2 concentrations used (Fig. 6A). In addition,
gene depletion also resulted in an increase in microtubule
mass for at least one of the concentrations tested for each
of the 7 genes (Fig. 6B). Depletion of these genes resulted in
enhanced paclitaxel-induced loss of cell viability in shortterm assays and a significant decrease in the ability of
cancer cells to form colonies in long-term assays in SKOv3
and Hey ovarian cancer cell lines (Fig. 6C and D). Similar
results were obtained following depletion of RAPGEF4 in
the paclitaxel-resistant A549-T12 lung carcinoma cells that
are known to have microtubule level of resistance to
paclitaxel (12). We first confirmed that paclitaxel-induced
microtubule stabilization was significantly reduced in A549T12 cells compared with the parent paclitaxel-sensitive
A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). RAPGEF4-specific
siRNA treatment of the A549-T12 cells resulted in a significant increase in paclitaxel microtubule stabilization and
partially restored paclitaxel sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig. S8). These results confirm the strong mechanistic effect
of modulating microtubule stability on microtubule polymer mass and paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity.

Discussion
Pharmacologic approaches for overcoming resistance to
chemotherapy in general and to antimitotic agents in particular have often focused on enhancing general mechanisms
of cytotoxicity such as apoptosis (37–39), rather than on
modulating drug-specific targets. Methods used to enhance
cytotoxicity often lack specificity and such approaches,
while important, are likely to induce unwanted off-target
effects. In spite of the detailed knowledge of the mechanism
of action of paclitaxel, identifying mechanism-specific methods for modulating its cytotoxic effect via modulating
microtubules or mitosis has remained elusive. This work
confirms and generalizes the concept that modulating
microtubule stability in cancer cells is an effective method

www.aacrjournals.org

for enhancing paclitaxel cytotoxicity. This study has also
discovered several targets that could be exploited for
therapeutic benefit.
In contrast to several previously conducted siRNA screens
that have focused on measuring a single general endpoint in
multiple cell lines, we have conducted a comprehensive
analysis of the effect of siRNA depletion on multiple related
but independent outcomes, focusing on the paclitaxel-specific endpoint of microtubule stability as well as the more
general parameters of cell viability and apoptosis. This
approach revealed a previously underestimated level of
complexity in regulating cell fate following paclitaxel treatment. Discordant results in the 3 assays after knockdown of
certain groups of kinases indicate that promoting cell death
through one mechanism does not necessarily predict outcomes for other seemingly parallel mechanisms of cell death.
This may, in part, explain the inconsistency in the results
obtained between different studies when evaluating a novel
target for therapy.
Our work identified several gene clusters that influence
paclitaxel response in strikingly different ways. More than a
third of the genes that sensitized cells to paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis and nearly half of the genes that sensitized cells to
paclitaxel-mediated cell death also enhanced paclitaxelinduced microtubule stability (P ¼ 0.03 and <0.001, respectively). This analysis confirmed that enhancing microtubule
stability following paclitaxel treatment is strongly associated
with enhanced paclitaxel-induced cell death. Although it is
intuitive to hypothesize that enhancing microtubule stability
following paclitaxel treatment should be followed by higher
apoptosis and loss of cell viability, not all siRNAs that increased
microtubule stability enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel in this
screen. An important limitation of short-term assays as those
conducted in this screen, is the undue sensitivity of the assay to
cell population kinetics. As paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is
dependent on passage through mitosis, decreasing cell population doubling time due to suboptimal transfection conditions
may result in false negative results. We have, therefore, extensively optimized assay development conditions prior to the
screen to avoid this potential pitfall. However, the total elimination of this possibility is difficult to confirm.
How microtubule stabilization results in enhanced paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity is likely to be multifactorial. However, our findings suggest that induction of apoptosis
following increased mitotic arrest is likely to be the predominant mechanism. Consistent with previous findings (40),
our work reveals the importance of the effect of modulating
apoptosis on cell fate such that a negative effect on apoptosis
may negate a therapeutic advantage of enhancing microtubule
stability. In contrast to targeting the intrinsically promiscuous
kinases that share and phosphorylate many substrates, targeting microtubule-specific molecular targets may result in a
tighter concordance between the magnitude of microtubule
stability and cytotoxicity.
Another possibility for the effect of enhancing microtubule
stability on increasing paclitaxel-induced cell death is interfering with vesicular transport of key survival and transcription factors to the nucleus. To investigate this hypothesis, we

tested whether microtubule stabilization or depolymerization
decreased the nuclear transport of a constitutively activated
transcription factor in SKOv3 cells, STAT3 (41, 42). This
revealed that microtubule depolymerization using Nocodazole resulted in a significant decrease in nuclear accumulation
of phospho-STAT3, in contrast to paclitaxel used at concentrations up to 100 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S9). Whether
depletion of motor proteins involved in nuclear transport of
transcription factors may result in sensitization to paclitaxel
by targeting several transcription factors at the same time will
remain to be tested.
The identification of molecular predictive markers is
required for personalization of therapy (43). A significant
obstacle to identifying clinically relevant predictive markers
for taxane response is that, in clinical practice, most tumors
are treated by a combination of paclitaxel and other chemotherapies (3, 4). Therefore, using standard endpoints for
measuring response, such as radiological monitoring of
tumor size or measuring the level of tumor markers, cannot
distinguish the effect of individual drugs. Similarly, it is not
possible to use early indicators of cytotoxicity, such as
apoptosis markers, as endpoints in such studies. In this
work, we showed that baseline microtubule stability is an
important determinant of paclitaxel-induced microtubule
stabilization and cytotoxicity. This presents a testable
hypothesis that microtubule stability could be measured
either as a predictive marker of paclitaxel response or as
a surrogate endpoint for paclitaxel response that could be
utilized to identify clinically relevant predictive molecular
biomarkers. Measuring the magnitude of microtubule stability at presentation is feasible by measuring Glu-tubulin
levels in tumors (44). In addition to measuring baseline
microtubule stability, it is possible to hypothesize that a
certain threshold of microtubule stability is required for
paclitaxel to exert its cytotoxic effect in patients. Measuring
paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability in mouse models
and in specifically designed early-phase clinical trials will
help in testing the relevance of this method in predicting
paclitaxel response.
Mechanisms regulating microtubule dynamics are most
probably shared between cancer and noncancer cells. For
example, depletion of the microtubule-associated protein
Tau, which is thought to compete with paclitaxel for binding
sites in b-tubulin, in human skin fibroblasts grown in culture
results in a significant increase in paclitaxel-induced microtubule stabilization (Supplementary Fig. S10). However, we
have shown that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is dependent
on cell cycling (Supplementary Fig. S4). As many nontumor
cell types are noncycling, the concept of specific targeting of
microtubules to enhance paclitaxel-induced stabilization
ensures the minimization of toxicity. Importantly, our study

identified enhancers of microtubule stabilization following
the administration of substoichiometric concentrations of
paclitaxel (8 nmol/L) to mimic the concentrations that
would be expected in the vicinity of ovarian cancers in
patients. In contrast to poorly vascularized cancer tissue,
nontumor cycling cells such as those in bone marrow are
probably exposed to much higher concentrations of paclitaxel (above 50 nmol/L) that result in near stoichiometry
and full microtubule stabilization (45, 46). Therefore, we
hypothesize that enhancers of paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability may only increase cell death in cancer cells and
not normal bone marrow cells as the former is exposed to
much lower doses of paclitaxel. Future experiments in
animal models of cancer will address this hypothesis. In
addition, prioritization of targets for testing in preclinical
and clinical models will depend on the pattern of expression
and activity of the identified targets in ovarian and other
cancers and the availability of inhibitors for the identified
targets. In those instances where kinases are overexpressed
or activated, selective enhancement of microtubule stability
might be achieved within cancer cells, increasing rates of
response. In contrast to many earlier studies, the goal would
be to enhance primary sensitivity, rather than reverse
mechanisms of acquired resistance.
In summary, this work shows that modulation of baseline
microtubule stability is a key determinant for paclitaxelinduced microtubule stabilization and cytotoxicity. This finding has important predictive and therapeutic implications
that could be tested in preclinical and clinical models of
paclitaxel therapy.
