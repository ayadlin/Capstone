Abstract
Cathelicidins are a family of bacteriocidal polypeptides secreted by macrophages and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMN). LL-37, the only human cathelicidin, has been implicated in tumorigenesis, but there has been
limited investigation of its expression and function in cancer. Here, we report that LL-37 activates a p53-mediated,
caspase-independent apoptotic cascade that contributes to suppression of colon cancer. LL-37 was expressed
strongly in normal colon mucosa but downregulated in colon cancer tissues, where in both settings its expression
correlated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive apoptotic
cells. Exposure of colon cancer cells to LL-37 induced phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation
in a manner independent of caspase activation. Apoptogenic function was mediated by nuclear translocation of
the proapoptotic factors, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG), through p53-dependent
upregulation of Bax and Bak and downregulation of Bcl-2 via a pertussis toxin–sensitive G-protein–coupled
receptor (GPCR) pathway. Correspondingly, colonic mucosa of cathelicidin-deﬁcient mice exhibited reduced
expression of p53, Bax, and Bak and increased expression of Bcl-2 together with a lower basal level of apoptosis.
Cathelicidin-deﬁcient mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis,
establishing pathophysiologic relevance in colon cancer. Collectively, our ﬁndings show that LL-37 activates a
GPCR-p53-Bax/Bak/Bcl-2 signaling cascade that triggers AIF/EndoG–mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

Introduction
Cathelicidin is a host defense peptide secreted by bone
marrow cells, circulating leukocytes, and numerous types of
epithelial tissues. It plays an active role in the maintenance of
innate immunity. Not only does this peptide eliminate pathogenic microbes directly by serving as a natural antibiotic,
but it also orchestrates a complex integration of host defense
responses, including chemotaxis, cytokine production, and
tissue repair (1). In human, cathelicidin is expressed as a 18kDa preproprotein known as human cationic antimicrobial

protein 18 (hCAP18). Proteolytic cleavage of hCAP18 is
required for the release of the mature peptide LL-37. In the
gastrointestinal tract, cathelicidin protects against Helicobacter pylori infection, promotes gastric ulcer healing, and alleviates inﬂammation in ulcerative colitis (2–4). LL-37 is highly
expressed in colonic epithelial cells of the surface and upper
crypts. Deeper crypt regions also have low-to-moderate level
expression of LL-37 (5).
Emerging evidence supports that cathelicidin is implicated
in malignant diseases. The expression of LL-37 is dysregulated
in gastric, ovarian, lung, and breast cancers as well as melanoma and leukemia (6–11). The role of cathelicidin in tumorigenesis is complex and believed to be context-dependent (12).
Acting as a tumor-suppressor, the expression of hCAP18/LL-37
is downregulated in gastric adenocarcinomas and acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia (6, 11, 13). In this regard, LL-37
induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells
and T lymphocytes, respectively (6, 14). The C-terminal fragment of LL-37 also exerts cytotoxic effects on both drugresistant and drug-sensitive oral epitheloid carcinoma cells
(15). Cathelicidin also enhances the antitumor activity of
natural killer cells (16). The expression and function of cathelicidin in colon cancer, however, remain unclear.
A loss of balance between cell proliferation and cell death is
central to tumorigenesis. Apoptosis or type I–programmed cell
death is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. In the
colon, reduced rates of apoptosis are associated with an

LL-37 Induces AIF- and EndoG-Mediated Cell Death

increased risk of colon adenomas (17). In mammalian cells,
apoptotic signals are generally mediated through 2 caspasedependent molecular pathways, namely, intrinsic and extrinsic
cascades. Accumulating evidence supports that the third
molecular pathway of apoptosis does exist. This pathway is
characterized by the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) that trigger
chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation independent
of caspase activation (18). In the present study, we show that
LL-37 was substantially downregulated in human colon cancer
tissues and induced apoptosis in cultured colon cancer cells
through the third molecular pathway of apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
All primary antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology except formyl peptide
receptor 2 (FPR2) antibody (Abcam). All other chemicals and
reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise
speciﬁed.
Patient samples and immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded tissue microarrays (TMA) consisting of a
total of 102 formalin-ﬁxed colon adenocarcinoma tissues were
used. The corresponding noncancerous colon mucosal tissues
available from 60 matched cases were also included. The
median age of the patients was 68 years (32–92 years) and
the male to female ratio was 1.12:1. Immunohistochemical
staining of mature LL-37 and Ki-67 was conducted using
polyclonal LL-37 (C14) antibody (Santa Cruz) and Ki-67 antibody (ab15580), respectively, with standard avidin–biotin
method. The cytoplasmic expression of LL-37 and Ki-67 was
assessed by a proportion score (0, none; 1, <5%; 2, 5%–20%; 3,
>20% for LL-37; 0, none; 1, <20%; 2, 20%–40%; 3, >40% for Ki-67).
Experimental animals
129/VJ wild-type and cathelicidin-knockout (Cnlp/) mice
were produced as previously described (19). The mice were
maintained on normal diet and under standard laboratory
condition. The present study was approved by the Institutional
Laboratory Animals Ethics Committee.
Cell culture and assays for cell viability, cell cycle, and
necrotic cell death
The human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, HCT116, SW1116,
SW620, SW480, and LoVo and the normal colon ﬁbroblasts
CCD-18Co were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and authenticated with short-tandem repeat proﬁling by the vendor. Bax-knocked out (Bax/) and Baxhemizygously deleted (Baxþ/) HCT116 cells were generated
as previously described (20). Cells were maintained in their
respective recommended culture media, supplemented with
10% FBS (1% during treatment), 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cell viability, cell-cycle distribution, and
necrotic cell death were determined by MTT, ﬂow cytometry,
and lactate dehydrogenase release assays, respectively, as
previously described (6).

Methylated-DNA capture (MethylCap)-qPCR
Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and bisulﬁte-modiﬁed using EZ DNA Methylation Kit
(Zymo Research). Methylated DNA was isolated from sonicated DNA (200–600 base-pair fragments) with afﬁnity puriﬁcation using MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit
(Invitrogen). Equal amounts of ampliﬁed MethylCap and input
DNAs were quantiﬁed using PCR primers targeting the hypermethylated regions by SYBR Green-base detection (Applied
Biosystems) as previously described (21).
Nuclear protein extraction and Western
immunoblotting
The isolation of nuclear and cytosolic protein was
conducted using NucBuster Protein Extraction Kit (EMD
Biosciences). For isolation of whole-cell protein, cells were
harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amount of proteins
were resolved by SDS–PAGE followed by a standard immunoblotting procedure.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells grown on coverslips were ﬁxed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. The cells were then covered with
10% (v/v) goat serum for 60 minutes at room temperature
followed by incubation with diluted primary antibody at 4 C
overnight. Cells were then probed with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Fluorescent signals were
detected using a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon
EZ-C1, Nikon).
RNA interference and Bcl-2 overexpression
The expression of AIF, EndoG, Bak, and p53 were lowered
using predesigned target-speciﬁc siRNAs purchased from Qiagen. The Flag-Bcl-2 expression vector (18003) was obtained
from Addgene, deposited by Dr. Clark W. Distelhorst (Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). siRNAs or puriﬁed
plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen).
Quantitation of DNA fragmentation
DNA fragmentation in human colon cancer cell lines and
mouse tissue samples was measured by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The mouse
mucosal TUNEL-positive cells were evaluated in 5 randomized
ﬁelds at 400 magniﬁcation, and the average was taken and
expressed as the number of apoptotic cells of each samples. For
human TMAs, apoptotic cells were measured using the TUNEL
stain with the Dead-End Kit (Promega). Apoptosis was assessed
by a proportion score (0, none; 1, <5%; 2, 5%–10%; 3, >10%).
Quantitation of phosphatidylserine externalization
Treated cells were resuspended in staining buffer containing
propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V–ﬂorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Invitrogen). After incubation for 15 minutes in
dark, double-labeled cells were analyzed by the FACSCalibur
System and CellQuest program.

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as means  SD of multiple experiments, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Statistical analysis was
conducted with Student t test or an ANOVA followed by the
Tukey t test where appropriate. P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Tissue microarray revealed the downregulation of LL-37
and its correlation with apoptosis in human colon cancer
tissues
In noncancerous colonic mucosa, intermediate-to-high
levels of cytoplasmic stain of LL-37 was observed (Fig. 1A). In
colon cancers, 68 of 102 (66.7%) cases showed complete loss of
LL-37 expression. Weak, intermediate, and strong immunoreactivities were noted in 18.6% (19/102), 5.9% (6/102), and 8.8%
(9/102) of the cases, respectively (Fig. 1A). In 48 corresponding
adjacent noncancerous tissues in which LL-37 immune scores
were available, downregulation of LL-37 was seen in 46 of 48

(95.8%) cases (Fig. 1B; P < 0.0001). The overall expression of
LL-37 in 102 cases of colon cancer was also signiﬁcantly
lowered than that of noncancerous-colonic tissues (Fig. 1C;
P < 0.0001). Colonic epithelial cells were the major cell type
that expressed LL-37, although immunoreactivity to LL-37
was also detected in submucosal leukocytes. The immune
score of LL-37 was also positively correlated with TUNEL- but
not Ki-67–positive (Fig. 1D and E) cells. The downregulation
of LL-37 was not associated with the differentiation status or
stage of the tumors.
DNA demethylation restored LL-37 expression in colon
cancer cells
Cultured human colon cancer cells were treated with different epigenetic modifying agents, namely, 5-aza-20 deoxycytidine (5AZA; a DNA demethylating agent), trichostatin A
(TSA; a histone deacetylase inhibitor), and 3-deazaneplanocin
A (DZNep; a histone methylation inhibitor; ref. 22). 5AZA but
not TSA or DZNep restored LL-37 expression in cultured colon

of colon cancer on TMAs. Representative LL-37 immunostaining in the noncancerous colonic mucosa (i) and colon cancer tissues (ii–iv) with LL-37 expression
scores from 1 to 3 are shown. B, the percentage of LL-37–expressing cells was signiﬁcantly lower in tumor tissues as compared with corresponding
adjacent noncancerous tissues in 48 patients with colon cancer (P < 0.001; paired t test). C, the overall expression of LL-37 in 102 colon cancer tissues was
signiﬁcantly lower as compared with 48 noncancerous mucosal tissues (P < 0.001; unpaired t test). D, representative TUNEL and Ki-67 staining in
colon cancer tissues with different levels of LL-37 expression were shown. E, TUNEL score was signiﬁcantly higher in colon cancer tissues with high
expression of LL-37 than those with no or low-level LL-37 expression. F, Ki-67 score had no association with LL-37 expression in colon cancer tissues.

expression by DNA demethylation in
colon cancer cells. A, HCT116 cells
were treated with 5AZA
(1 mmol/L) for 72 hours, TSA
(300 nmol/L) for 20 hours, or DZNep
(1 mmol/L) for 48 hours, in
combination or alone, followed by
RNA extraction and quantitation of
hCAP18/LL-37 mRNA by real-time
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
B, treatment with 5AZA

E, demethylation of CAMP promoter
was conﬁrmed by reduced

cancer cells (Fig. 2A–C). Concordantly, methylated-DNA capture coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that DNA
methylation in the promoter of CAMP (the gene encoding
hCAP18/LL-37) was signiﬁcantly higher in primary colon
cancer tissues and human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and
LoVo as compared with normal colonic mucosa (Fig. 2D). In
contrast, 5AZA treatment reduced the DNA methylation level
(Fig. 2E). These ﬁndings would suggest that promoter DNA
methylation was responsible for the downregulation of LL-37
in human colon cancer.
LL-37 induced DNA fragmentation and
phosphatidylserine externalization without caspase
activation in colon cancer cells
A panel of human colon cancer cell lines that consisted of
HCT116 (p53 wild-type), LoVo (p53 wild-type), SW1116 (p53
mutant), SW480 (p53 mutant), and SW620 (p53 mutant), were
treated with increasing concentrations of synthetic LL-37
peptide (Invitrogen) for 24 hours. The effect of LL-37 on normal
colon ﬁbroblasts CCD-18Co was also determined. MTT assay
showed that LL-37 strongly reduced cell viability at doses
ranging from 20 to 60 mmol/L in p53 wild-type HCT1116 and
LoVo. LL-37 did not show any effect on the viability of these 2

cell lines at low doses (500 ng/mL to 10 mg/mL; equivalent to
111 nmol/L to 2.2 mmol/L) that have been shown to stimulate
cell proliferation in other cancer types (7–9). LL-37 also exerted
signiﬁcant but lesser inhibitory effects on p53-mutant SW1116,
SW480, and SW620 but exhibited minimal cytotoxicity in CCD18Co (Fig. 3A). In addition, mCRAMP (the murine cathelicidin)
was used to treat the mouse cancer cell line Colon-26 (p53 wildtype) and the mouse immortalized colonocytes YAMC. Similar
to the effect of LL-37, mCRAMP reduced cell viability of Colon26 but had minimal effect on YAMC (Fig. 3A). These ﬁndings
suggest that cathelicidin may have differential cytotoxicity
toward p53 wild-type colon cancer cells over normal cells and
p53-mutant colon cancer cells. Lactate dehydrogenase release
assay indicated that LL-37 at the tested concentrations did
not induce necrotic cell death (data not shown). Cell-cycle
analysis showed that LL-37 treatment resulted in the accumulation of the sub-G1 phase, which was suggestive of DNA
fragmentation associated with apoptosis (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The apoptogenic effect of LL-37 in colon
cancer cells was subsequently conﬁrmed by TUNEL assay (Fig.
3C and Supplementary Fig. S1B) and Annexin V staining (Fig.
3D), which detects DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine
externalization, respectively. Activation of caspases and the

subsequent cleavage of PARP are classic molecular markers of
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, after 24 and 48 hours of LL-37 treatment, no increase in PARP cleavage nor activation of caspase-3,
-7, and -9 could be observed. On the contrary, both activation of
caspases and cleavage of PARP were reduced by LL-37 (Fig. 3E),
hinting at the possibility that LL-37 induced apoptotic cell
death in a caspase-independent manner. This postulation
was corroborated by the ﬁnding that the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk failed to reverse the loss of cell viability caused by
LL-37 in HCT116 and LoVo (Fig. 3F).

LL-37 triggered nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG
to mediate apoptosis
AIF and EndoG are known mediators of cell death in
caspase-independent apoptosis. These mediators, originally
localized in the mitochondria, translocate into the nucleus to
initiate DNA degradation upon activation by apoptotic signals
(18). As shown in Fig. 4A, LL-37 increased the nuclear protein
levels of AIF and EndoG and inversely reduced their cytosolic
levels. The increases in the nuclear expression of AIF and
EndoG were peaked at 6 hours after LL-37 treatment. The

change of subcellular localization of AIF and EndoG in
response to LL-37 treatment was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence. After exposure to LL-37 for 6 hours, AIF and EndoG
redistributed from the cytosol to the nucleus (Fig. 4B and C and
Supplementary Fig. S1C). To determine whether AIF and
EndoG were functionally involved in LL-37–induced apoptosis,
RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down their
expression. Transfection with AIF- or EndoG-siRNA reduced
nuclear protein levels (Fig. 4D) and nuclear localization (Fig.
4E) of respective target induced by LL-37. RNAi targeting AIF
and EndoG, alone or in combination, signiﬁcantly reduced the
DNA fragmentation caused by LL-37 as revealed by TUNEL
assay (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S1D).

were most prominent at 6 hours after LL-37 treatment. To this
end, genetic ablation of Bax, knockdown of Bak, or restoration
of Bcl-2 expression reduced the nuclear protein levels of AIF
and EndoG (Fig. 5B) and apoptosis (Fig. 5C) that were induced
by LL-37. The reversal effect of genetic ablation of Bax was
more prominent than that was detected in the knockdown of
Bak. In this regard, knockdown of Bak in Bax/ cells or
overexpression of Bcl-2 almost completely reversed LL-37–
induced AIF/EndoG nuclear expression and apoptosis (Fig. 5B
and C). These results would suggest that upregulation of Bax
and Bak and downregulation of Bcl-2 were required for caspase-independent apoptosis that was induced by LL-37 in
colon cancer cells.

Altered expression of Bcl-2 family members was required
for AIF- and EndoG-mediated apoptosis induced by
LL-37
The mitochondrial release of AIF and EndoG is mediated by
members of the Bcl-2 family (23). In this connection, LL-37
upregulated the proapoptotic Bax and Bak and reduced the
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S1E). The
upregulation of Bax and Bak and the downregulation of Bcl-2

p53 Activation was required for LL-37–induced

knockdown of p53 reversed the
upregulation of Bax and Bak and
downregulation of Bcl-2 by LL-37
(40 mmol/L; 6 hours). C, nuclear
expression of AIF and EndoG
induced by LL-37 (40 mmol/L; 24
hours) was abolished by p53
knockdown. D, Annexin V staining
revealed p53 was required for LL-37
(24 hours)–induced apoptosis in
HCT116. E, the p53-mutant SW1116
colon cancer cells were resistant to
the apoptogenic effect of LL-37
(40 mmol/L; 24 hours) as measured by
Annexin V staining. F, Gi-coupled
GPCR was inactivated by
preincubation with PTX (40 ng/mL)
for 2 hours before addition of LL-37
for 6 hours in HCT116. Inactivation of
Gi-coupled GPCR reversed the
upregulation of p53, Bax, and Bak
and downregulation of Bcl-2 induced
by LL-37. The apoptogenic effect of
LL-37 (20 mmol/L; 24 hours) was also
partially blocked by PTX but not
by the FPR2 antagonist WRW4
(5 mmol/L; 24 hours pretreatment) as
measured by Annexin V staining in
HCT116. Results were
representative of 3 independent
experiments.

protein expression of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis
(PUMA), a direct target gene of p53, was increased upon
treatment with LL-37 in HCT116. The increased nuclear levels
of p53 were peaked at 3 hours after LL-37 treatment, which
preceded the altered expression of Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2. To
conﬁrm if the altered expression of Bcl-2 family members
caused by LL-37 was p53-dependent, we used siRNA to silence
p53 in HCT116. Knockdown of p53 signiﬁcantly reversed the
induction of Bax and Bak as well as the downregulation of
Bcl-2 caused by LL-37 (Fig. 6B). Above all, knockdown of p53
reversed the increase in the nuclear expression of AIF and
EndoG (Fig. 6C) and apoptosis (Fig. 6D) in LL-37–treated

HCT116 cells. In line with proposed central role of p53,
LL-37 failed to induce phosphatidylserine externalization in
the p53-mutant SW1116 colon cancer cells (Fig. 6E).
The apoptogenic action of LL-37 was mediated by
G-protein–coupled receptor
The biologic effect of LL-37 has been reported to be mediated through Gi-coupled G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)
in several cell types (27, 28). Here, we have shown that pertussis
toxin (PTX) as an inhibitor of Gi-coupled GPCR reversed
the upregulation of p53, Bax, and Bak and the downregulation
of Bcl-2 by LL-37. More importantly, PTX was also observed

to reduce LL-37–induced phosphatidylserine externalization in HCT116 (Fig. 6F). We found that FPR2 (formerly known
as formyl peptide receptor like-1), a Gi-coupled GPCR that
has been shown to mediate the biologic action of LL-37 in
other cell types, was expressed in colon cancer cells (data not
shown). Nevertheless, the speciﬁc antagonist WRW4 failed to
reverse the action of LL-37 (Fig. 6F), suggesting that a nonFPR2 Gi-coupled GPCR was responsible for the activation of
p53-Bcl-2/Bax/Bak axis by LL-37 to induce caspase-independent apoptosis.
Cathelicidin-knockout mice showed reduced basal
apoptotic rate in colonic mucosa and increased
susceptibility to azoxymethane-induced gross colonic
tumors
The protein expression of p53, Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2 together
with the basal level of apoptotic cells were determined in wildtype and cathelicidin-knockout (Cnlp/) mice. As compared

with the wild-type mice, Cnlp/ mice exhibited lower basal
expression of p53, Bax, and Bak and higher basal expression of
Bcl-2 in the colonic mucosa (Fig. 7A). Phenotypically, Cnlp/
mice had signiﬁcantly reduced number of TUNEL-positive cells
in the colonic mucosa as compared with the wild-type mice
(Fig. 7B). However, genetic ablation of Cnlp in mice did not
have any substantial effect on crypt length or cellularity of the
colon under normal conditions. To study the in vivo function of
cathelicidin in the context of colon tumorigenesis, wild-type
and Cnlp/ mice (n ¼ 7 in each group) were injected intraperitoneally with azoxymethane (Fig. 7C), a colon-speciﬁc
carcinogen capable of inducing only microscopic premalignant lesions (i.e., aberrant crypt foci) but not normally gross
tumors in mice. At 16 weeks after the last injection of azoxymethane, all 7 Cnlp/ mice developed gross colonic tumors.
In contrast, only 1 of 7 wild-type mice developed a minor
colonic tumor, whereas the remaining mice were free from
macroscopic lesion. The multiplicity and total tumor mass of

Discussion
LL-37 is the only cathelicidin found in humans. The contextdependent function of LL-37 poses some difﬁculties to deﬁne
and understand its exact role in tumorigenesis. For example,
while LL-37 has been shown to promote the growth of ovarian
(7), lung (8), and breast cancers (9), the same peptide exerts
tumor-suppressing effects in gastric cancer (6), acute myeloid
(13), and lymphocytic leukemia (11). Consistent with its role as
a tumor suppressor, LL-37 expression is downregulated in
colon cancer. The correlation between LL-37 and apoptosis
but not cell proliferation has also been shown by clinical
sample analysis. Subsequent experiments revealed that promoter DNA hypermethylation might account for the downregulation of LL-37. Cathelicidin-deﬁcient mice also exhibited
increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced colonic
tumors. The prominent downregulation of LL-37 and its
association with apoptosis in human colon cancer prompt us
to investigate whether LL-37 has apoptogenic function in colon

tumorigenesis. In this study, our data revealed that, in p53
wild-type colon cancer cells, LL-37 induced phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation without caspase activation, suggesting the occurrence of caspase-independent apoptosis. Such an apoptogenic role of cathelicidin
has been reported in other cell types, such as periodontal
ligament cells and infected airway epithelium (29, 30). But
for the ﬁrst time through our investigations, it is shown that
cathelicidin acts through the caspase-independent pathway
to mediate apoptosis in colon cancer cells.
The tumor-suppressor protein p53 accumulates in cells in
response to DNA damage, oncogene activation, and other
stresses. Depending on the cellular context, activation of
p53 could lead to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence, differentiation, and autophagy (31). Restoring p53 activity is an attractive approach for cancer therapy and has led to
the identiﬁcation of a number of potential anticancer therapeutics, such as CP-31398 and Nutlin (32). Here, we show that
LL-37 increased whole-cell p53 expression and p53 nuclear
accumulation accompanied by induction of PUMA, Bax, and
Bak and reduction of Bcl-2. In agreement, p53 has been shown
to transcriptionally activate BAX and repress BCL2 (33, 34). The

regulation of p53 and the Bcl-2 family members (i.e., Bax, Bak,
and Bcl-2) by cathelicidin was also recapitulated in Cnlp/
mice. Our ﬁndings indicated that p53 plays a central role in
cathelicidin-induced caspase-independent apoptosis.
AIF/EndoG–mediated DNA fragmentation represents a
major mechanism of caspase-independent apoptosis (18).
Here, we clearly showed that LL-37 induced nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG to mediate apoptosis. We also showed
that knockdown of AIF partially reduced the nuclear expression and localization of EndoG and vice versa (Fig. 4D and E),
suggesting a novel reciprocal regulation between these 2 cell
death mediators. Although AIF has been shown to bind to
EndoG (35), it is the ﬁrst time to show the existence of such a
cooperative interaction. The release of AIF and EndoG is
regulated by mitochondrial outer membrane permeability,
which is in turn controlled by the relative abundance of the
pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Consistent
with its role in apoptosis, LL-37–induced nuclear translocation
of AIF/EndoG was paralleled by the upregulation of Bax and
Bak and the downregulation of Bcl-2. The BH3-only protein
PUMA, which is required for Bax- and Bak-mediated cell death
(36), was also upregulated by LL-37. Bax and Bak can form
complexes at the mitochondrial outer membrane to facilitate
the release of apoptogenic mediators, whereas Bcl-2 sequesters
BH3-only molecules to prevent the activation of Bax and Bak
(37). In particular, Bax and Bak could promote the release of
AIF and EndoG in a caspase-independent manner (38). Bcl-2
could also interact with Bax directly to prevent its homooligomerization that is required for membrane permeabilization (39). Our study shows that altered expression of these Bcl-2
family members triggers the activation of AIF and EndoG in LL37–treated colon cancer cells.
In this study, PTX as an inhibitor of Gi-coupled GPCR
blocked the apoptogenic effect and downstream signaling of
LL-37. Several receptors, including FPR2, EGF receptor (EGFR),
P27 purinoceptor, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), and type I
insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), have been
reported to mediate the biologic actions of cathelicidin
(27, 40–43). Among these, only FPR2 is a PTX-sensitive GPCR.
The others are receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and IGF-1R),
membrane ion channel (P27), or MyD88-dependent receptor
(TLR-9) that are not coupled to G-protein. Although FPR2 was
expressed in colon cancer cells, the speciﬁc antagonist WRW4
failed to reverse the action of LL-37, suggesting a FPR2-independent mechanism. However, it is still untested whether LL37 by itself could bind to FPR2 and to initiate the downstream
signaling in colon cancer cells. It is also unclear whether the
binding of LL-37 to FPR2 could be blocked by WRW4. Aside
from FPR2, Niyonsaba and colleagues reported that the chemotactic effect of LL-37 on mast cells is mediated by another Gi

-coupled GPCR (28). Further investigations will be needed to
identify the receptor for LL-37 in colon cancer cells. Whether
the tissue-dependent expression of receptors may alter the
oncogenic or tumor-suppressing function of LL-37 also warrants further study.
In cancer therapy, the rapid regrowth of tumor after initial
response to chemotherapeutic agents constitute a major clinical challenge. A recent study has shown that caspase-3 activation in dying cancer cells triggered the release of prostaglandin E2, which in turn stimulated the growth of surviving
tumor cells (44). This ﬁnding would suggest that novel therapeutic agents that modulate through a caspase-independent
mechanism may hold speciﬁc promises for cancer drug development. Our data support that LL-37 could induce caspaseindependent apoptosis in human colon cancer cells via the
activation of Gi-coupled GPCR-p53-Bcl-2/Bax/Bak-AIF/EndoG
cascade. Our study not only elucidated the tumor-suppressing
mechanism of LL-37 in colon tumorigenesis, but also supports
the development of synthetic LL-37 peptide as an inducer of
caspase-independent apoptosis.
