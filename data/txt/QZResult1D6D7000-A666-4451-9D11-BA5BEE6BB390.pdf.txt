Abstract
A major drawback to doxorubicin as a cancer-treating drug is
cardiac toxicity. To understand the mechanism of doxorubicin
cardiac toxicity and the potent synergic effect seen when
doxorubicin is combined with anti-ErbB2 (trastuzumab), we
developed an in vivo rat model that exhibits progressive
dose-dependent cardiac damage and loss of cardiac function
after doxorubicin treatment. The hearts of these animals
respond to doxorubicin damage by increasing levels of ErbB2
and the ErbB family ligand, neuregulin 1B, and by activating
the downstream Akt signaling pathway. These increases in
ErbB2 protein levels are not due to increased ErbB2 mRNA,
however, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms for
regulating this protein in the heart. Accordingly, levels of
heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a known ErbB2 protein
stabilizer and chaperone, are increased by doxorubicin
treatment, and coimmunoprecipitation reveals binding of
HSP90 to ErbB2. Isolated cardiomyocytes are more susceptible
to doxorubicin after treatment with HSP90 inhibitor, 17(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, suggesting that the
HSP90 is protective during doxorubicin treatment. Thus, our
results provide one plausible mechanism for the susceptibility
of the heart to anti-ErbB2 therapy post-doxorubicin therapy
in subclinical and clinical conditions. Additionally, these
results suggest that further testing is needed for HSP90
inhibitors under various conditions in the heart. [Cancer Res
2007;67(4):1436–41]

Knockout mice of ErbB2, ErbB4, or its ligand neuregulin 1h
(NRG1h) die in utero due to cardiac development impairment
(3–5). Additionally, cardiomyocytes isolated from mice with
reduced cardiac ErbB2 have an increased sensitivity to doxorubicin
(6). Consistent with this, heterozygote NRG1h-deficient mice are
more sensitive to doxorubicin showing ErbB2 pathway importance
in the heart (7). One unanswered question in this field, however,
is how doxorubicin exposure affects ErbB2 expression and Akt
activation in the heart. If this occurred, as a protective response,
it could explain why ErbB2 inhibition would put the heart at risk
for doxorubicin toxicity.
Because ErbB2 and downstream signaling seem protective during
doxorubicin treatment, another protein that should be considered
in the context of doxorubicin injury is heat shock protein (HSP) 90
(HSP90), a modulator and chaperone of ErbB2. Inhibitors of HSP90,
which are being developed for cancer therapy, induce the release of
ErbB2 from HSP90, resulting in subsequent ErbB2 proteosomal
degradation (8, 9). This protein:protein association is also important
in cultured cardiomyocytes because HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin
induces ErbB2 protein degradation (10), but it is not known if ErbB2
and HSP90 associate in vivo in the heart or if doxorubicin induces
HSP90 in this setting.
Investigation of an animal model may help address some of
these issues. Therefore, we developed a rat model of doxorubicin
injury to the heart to investigate cellular and molecular responses
to this drug.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Doxorubicin is an effective agent for treatment of cancer, but
dosing is limited by irreversible, long-term cardiac damage. For
treatment of breast cancers with HER2 amplification, doxorubicin
is commonly administered in combination with anti-ErbB2
(Herceptin-trastuzumab) because these two drugs act synergistically to kill cancer cells. Yet, this combination results in even more
frequent (up to 30%), and sometimes fatal, cardiomyopathy (1, 2).
The mechanism of this doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and the
synergy with trastuzumab is not sufficiently understood to help
identify patients at high risk for cardiac damage before treatment
or during the early stages of treatment.
The effects of trastuzumab on the heart would suggest an
impairment role of ErbB2 signaling in the heart, and this is
supported by experiments using genetically engineered mice.

Animals. Female Sprague-Dawley 10-week-old rats (200 g) were acquired
from Zivic Miller (Pittsburgh, PA) and acclimated for 1 week. All procedures
associated with this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and done in a facility accredited by the
Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care International.
Study design. Animals were randomly assigned to one of three
treatment groups: doxorubicin treatment of 2.5 mg/kg for 6 weekly doses
and a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg (n = 10; Novaplus, Bedford Laboratories,
Bedford, OH),, doxorubicin treatment of 2.5 mg/kg for 3 weekly doses and
cumulative dose of 7.5 mg/kg (n = 10), or saline treatment for 6 weekly
doses (n = 10). Rats were monitored for changes in cardiovascular variables
via echocardiography from weeks 8 to 10 postinduction of treatment.
Cardiac toxicity was defined by a decline of cardiac fractional shortening
percentage to V45%. Treatments were given via jugular injections under
ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthesia.
Transthoracic echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography
was done using a Sequoia Acuson (Malvern, PA) C256 or Visualsonics
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Vevo 660 Echocardiography System. Ultrasound
machine operators were blinded to the experimental groups. Rats were
habituated before study to immobilization inside a modified disposable
rodent restrainer (Decapicone, Braintree Scientific, Inc., Braintree, MA).
This allowed imaging of an unanesthetized rat in f3 min. The heart was
first imaged in two-dimensional mode in parasternal short axis for left

ventricle at sweep speed of 200 mm/s. The cursor was positioned
perpendicular to interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall
at the level of the papillary muscles of left ventricle, whereas the twodimensional image was converted to M-mode echocardiogram. From the
M-mode echocardiogram image, left ventricular chamber diameters were
measured at the end of diastole (left ventricular end-diastolic internal
diameter) and systole (left ventricular end-systolic internal diameter).
Fractional shortening represents percentage change in left ventricular
chamber dimension with systolic contraction. For each rat, three values for
each measurement were obtained and averaged.
Necropsy. Rats were euthanized and received postmortem examination
and midwall left ventricle was sectioned and frozen for molecular studies.
The rest of the heart was fixed for histology and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) evaluation. In
addition, other rats were perfused via aortic cannulation with 0.2%
glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldahyde fixation for immunoelectron
microscopy.
Western analysis. Frozen left ventricle (40 mg) was rapidly homogenized in f500 AL radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer as described
(11), and standard gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were done. The
following antibodies were used: ErbB2 (sc-285; 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ErbB4 (sc-283; 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), NRG-1h (sc-1792; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),

(1:1,000; Cell Signaling), total Akt (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), HSP90 (1:1,000;
BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), and HSP70 (1:5,000;
Stressgen, San Diego, CA). After incubation in antirabbit or antimouse
horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:2500; Amersham, Piscataway,
NJ), blots were exposed to chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford,
IL) and exposed to CL-Xposure film (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Protein levels
were normalized to total Akt.
Coimmunoprecipitation. Frozen left ventricle was rapidly homogenized in f500 AL buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 10 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 8.8 g/mL
sodium pyrophosphate, 4 g/L Na/F). One milligram of protein was
precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
then incubated with 4 Ag antibody (HSP90 or ErbB2) for 2 h on a rotary
shaker at 4jC. After incubation, protein G-agarose beads were added for an
additional hour, then washed with fresh buffer, boiled for 5 min in Laemmli
SDS sample buffer, and frozen until used for Western blotting.
RNA analysis. Total RNA was isolated from 40 mg heart left ventricle
tissue using a Trizol RNeasy protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), with an incolumn Dnase treatment (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen). Quality and
concentration of the samples were evaluated using a NanoDrop ND-1000
and 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively. To generate RNA for real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) standards, a 661-bp region of the rat ErbB2
gene and a 363-bp region of the rat ribosomal 28s gene were generated
by PCR and cloned into the pCRII Topo plasmid (Invitrogen) using
the following primers: 5¶-GACTCGTCCTCCTGTGTGGC-3¶ ( forward) and

a Chromo 4 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the Quantitect PCR kit (Qiagen).
One microliter of cDNA from each reverse transcription reaction was
transferred in triplicate to two plates. In one plate, samples were mixed with
10 AL of Quantitect probe PCR kit, 200 nmol/L of each Erb2 primer,
100 nmol/L of ErbB2 probe, and RNase-free water for a final volume of
20 AL per reaction. In the other plate, the same procedure was followed using
primers and probe for ribosomal 28s RNA instead. After 40 cycles of 30 s at
94jC, 30 s at 58jC or 54jC ( for ErbB2 and 28s, respectively), and 30 s at 60jC,
amplicons were quantitated against standard curves generated by

Results and Discussion
Two cumulative doses of doxorubicin (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) or saline
were given to 10-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats over a
6-week period to develop a rat model to study the effects of
doxorubicin on heart function, morphology, and molecular
pathway activation. Fractional shortening percentage was used as
global systolic function indicator, and representative M-modes of
left ventricle and summary histograms (Fig. 1A and B) show
reduced contractility only in the 15 mg/kg group at 10 weeks from
the initial injection. Euthanasia and tissue harvesting were done at
10 weeks or when fractional shortening percentage was V45% in
these animals. Time-matched rats (10 weeks) were also euthanized
from the 7.5 mg/kg and control groups.
The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in left ventricles was
compared between three treatment groups: saline control, 7.5 mg/kg,
and 15 mg/kg (Fig. 1C and D). The 15 mg/kg treatment group
showed a higher level of cell death (30 F 6.7%; P < 0.05 TUNELpositive nuclei) accompanying the decline in contractility. Surprisingly, the 7.5 mg/kg group also showed a marked increase in cell
death (15 F 1.2%) compared with the saline control rats (5.7 F 0.3%),
although the 7.5 mg/kg rats did not show reduced contractility by
echocardiography. Interestingly, the 7.5 mg/kg group developed
contractility deficits and heart failure at 15 weeks in two subsequent
longitudinal studies (data not shown), indicating that the dose of
doxorubicin and timing of heart failure presentation are related.

We then evaluated the effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy on
heart ErbB2 expression and downstream signaling pathways in
experimental groups. As seen in Fig. 2, doxorubicin treatment
results in dose-dependent increases in ErbB2 protein levels and
parallel increases in phosphorylation of the downstream Akt,
mTOR, and 70S6k proteins. Interestingly, NRG1h, the most likely
ligand for ErbB2 and ErbB4 heterodimerization in the heart, was

also induced in both doxorubicin treatments. ErbB4 protein
expression did not vary between treatments. ErbB2 or ErbB4 was
not found differentially phosphorylated between the treatment
groups.
We also evaluated ErbB2 expression and subcellular location by
immunoelectron microscopy in hearts from doxorubicin- (15 mg/kg)
and saline-treated rats. ErbB2 is known to localize to cardiomyocyte

t-tubules, a tubular network of cell membrane invaginations (14).
Consistent with immunoblot results, ErbB2 immunogold–labeled
antibody complexes were elevated by doxorubicin treatment and
localized to cardiomyocyte t-tubules (Fig. 2C). Electron micrographs also show doxorubicin-induced dilation of t-tubules and
sarcoplasmic reticulum, a characteristic finding in doxorubicin
heart toxicity.
We then evaluated ErbB2 mRNA levels in the saline and
15 mg/kg treatment groups (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, ErbB2 mRNA
was not affected by doxorubicin treatment, leading us to consider
a post-transcriptional mechanism as an alternative means to
increase ErbB2 cardiac protein levels in injured cells. Because
HSP90 has been reported to stabilize ErbB2 in cancer cells and
cultured cardiomyocytes (8–10), we considered the possibility that
HSP90 is also responsible for stabilizing ErbB2 in the heart after
doxorubicin injury. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, HSP90 protein levels
were significantly increased in both of our doxorubicin groups, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that HSP90 associates
with ErbB2 in the setting of doxorubicin injury but not in salinetreated rats (Fig. 3D). We also observed significant increases in the
inducible form of HSP70 after doxorubicin injury, leading us to
conclude that these cells experience a generalized HSP response.
Because in vivo increases in HSP90 and ErbB2 cardiac
proteins occur even before cardiac dysfunction is detected by
echocardiography, we considered the consequence of HSP90
function inhibition in isolated cardiomyocytes using doxorubicin
and the HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, separately and in combination.
As shown by three different methods used to evaluate toxicity
(Fig. 4A–D), 17AAG alone is not toxic at low doses (1 Amol/L).
However, cotreatment with 17AAG markedly increases the toxicity
of doxorubicin. A higher dose of 17AAG is cardiotoxic, although
it is unlikely that this concentration is physiologically relevant.
To our knowledge, this is the first report showing ErbB2
elevation in the heart in response to injury and this observation
suggests that the increase in ErbB2 may initially be a survival
response to injury. However, as observed in both doxorubicin
cumulative doses studied here, injury above a yet undefined
threshold level cannot be rescued by ErbB2 or Akt activation.

Importantly, this elevation of ErbB2 (and activation of downstream
signaling) occurs before evidence of functional systolic deficits. If
a similar relationship occurs in humans, this molecular change
could potentially be used to predict which patients receiving antiErbB2 treatment are at risk for developing cardiac symptoms. AntiErbB2 is now used to treat patients in the adjuvant setting in early
(15) and in advanced cases of breast cancer.
Another important finding is the elevation of HSP90 and HSP70
in the heart responding to doxorubicin injury. HSPs are also
induced by exercise, a known protective factor for doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity (16, 17), and HSP70 protects the heart from hypoxia/
reoxygenation and postinfarction stresses in the heart (18, 19).
Presently, the protective role of HSP90 in oxidative stress
conditions has not been fully explored due to the lack of HSP90overexpressing mice. One issue that needs to be addressed is
whether other oxidative stress-induced cardiac injuries (e.g.,
ischemia/reperfusion or chemical oxidants) can effect in vivo
HSP90 cardiac expression and secondary modulation of stressrelated signal transduction. In addition to our findings with
doxorubicin, chronic cyclosporine A treatment also induces in vivo
HSP90 expression in the heart and is associated with modulation of
protective endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling (20), reflecting the importance of cardiac HSP90. HSP90 inhibitors are in
clinical development for cancer therapy, and our finding suggests
that further testing should be done to evaluate the potential
cardiac side effects of HSP90 inhibitors in vivo, especially in
situations in which the heart relies on HSP90 for protection.
Alternatively, devising strategies to selectively increase cardiac
HSP90 could offer a means of protecting the heart from
doxorubicin and other cardiotoxic drugs.
