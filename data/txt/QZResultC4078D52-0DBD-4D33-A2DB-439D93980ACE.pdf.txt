ABSTRACT
Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental cellular process and is elevated in cancer
cells. As one of the most energy consuming cellular processes, it is highly regulated
by signaling pathways in response to changing cellular conditions. Many of the
regulators of this process are aberrantly activated in various cancers. Recently two
novel rRNA synthesis inhibitors, CX-5461 and BMH-21, have been shown to selectively
kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Here, we tested the effectiveness of prerRNA synthesis inhibitor CX-5461 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with different
cytogenetic abnormalities. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are more sensitive to
rRNA synthesis inhibition compared to normal bone marrow cells. CX-5461 treated
cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis independent of their p53 status. Moreover, CX5461, activates checkpoint kinases and arrests cells in G2 phase of cell cycle.
Finally, overcoming this G2 arrest by inhibiting ATR kinase leads to robust cell killing.
These results show that CX-5461 can be even more potent in combination with ATR
inhibitors.

enhances rRNA synthesis and promotes tumor growth,
and both B and T- acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are
very sensitive to AKT inhibition [8, 9]. c-Myc, which is
over-expressed in a variety of hematological malignancies,
associates with ribosomal DNA and activates RNA
polymerase I transcription [10, 11, 12]. The AML1-ETO
fusion protein epigenetically controls cell growth through
up-regulation of rRNA synthesis in acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) cells [13].
CX-5461 and BMH-21, two recently developed
rRNA synthesis inhibitors, have been shown to have
therapeutic effects on a wide range of cancer cell lines,
with the most significant effects seen with hematological
cancers [14–15]. More importantly, they have been shown
to be selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells with minimal
effect on normal cells. BMH-21 was discovered in a small
molecule library screen for p53 activating compounds with
antitumor activity [16]. It binds to GC rich region, present
at high frequency in rDNA region, and inhibits RNA Pol I
transcription independent of DNA damage response [15, 17].
Interestingly, BMH-21 antitumor activity is associated with
proteasome dependent degradation of a catalytic subunit of

INTRODUCTION
Nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and
ribosomal subunit assembly [1]. It is a dynamic structure
and many of its constituents constantly exchange with
the nucleoplasm during interphase [2]. As one of the
most energy intensive processes, ribosome biogenesis is
constantly fine-tuned in response to growth conditions,
cellular stress and cell cycle. As a structure formed
to provide efficient ribosome biogenesis, nucleolus
disassembles at the onset of mitosis and reassembles during
telophase, mirroring the inhibition of rRNA synthesis
during prophase and its activation during telophase [3].
Similarly, nucleolus also unravels in response to inhibition
of ribosome biogenesis by certain drugs like 5-FU,
Actinomycin D and DRB [4]. Apart from its conventional
role in ribosome biogenesis, its non-traditional functions
include sensing cellular stress and control of aging
[3, 5, 6]. Changes in nucleolar morphology and functions
are widely observed in cancer tissues [7]. Many molecular
changes that drive various cancers have been shown to
modulate rRNA synthesis. For example, AKT activation

RESULTS

RNA Pol I complex. CX-5461 was first described by Drygin
et al. [14] as a novel small molecule inhibitor specific for
RNA Pol I multi-protein complex. It was discovered in a
chemical screen for compounds that selectively inhibit RNA
pol I transcription relative to Pol II transcription. Similar
to BMH-21, it selectively induces cell death in cancer
cells but has a different mechanism of action. It inhibits
the interaction between SL1 and rDNA thereby preventing
the formation of pre-initiation complex. Bywater et al. [18]
showed that CX-5461 disrupts nucleolar structure and its
therapeutic effect is p53-dependent. CX-5461 is currently
in a phase 1 clinical trial for hematological malignancies
and has been shown to be effective in mouse models of
B-lymphoma and MLL-AF9 AML [18].
As the cell lines used in previous study included
only one acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line,
we tested the effectiveness of pre-rRNA synthesis inhibitor
on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with different
cytogenetic abnormalities. We further investigated
the effect of rRNA synthesis inhibition on cell cycle
distribution. We showed that ATM/ATR pathway is
activated by CX-5461 treatment resulting in G2 phase
arrest. Finally, we showed that inhibition of ATR pathway
activation enhances CX-5461 mediated apoptosis.

CX-5461 inhibits proliferation of ALL cells
CX-5461 has previously shown anti-proliferative
activity in many solid cancer lines of NCI-60 panel. As
that panel had only one acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cell line, we tested the therapeutic potential of CX-5461
on a range of ALL cell lines. We treated 8 ALL cell lines
with varied cytogenetic abnormalities with increasing
concentrations of CX-5461 for 3 days (Supplementary
Table 1). The drug showed robust inhibition of cell
proliferation in the low nano-molar range in all cell
lines tested (Fig. 1A). As CX-5461 block the formation
of RNA Pol I pre-initiation complex, we investigated
the pre-rRNA levels in CX-5461 treated cells lines.
We choose 4 cell lines, SEM, KOPN-8, RS4;11 and
NALM-6, to check the rRNA synthesis inhibition after
drug treatment by qRT-PCR. As 45S pre-RNA has a very
short half-life (10 min), its level in the cell is indicative
of the rate of rRNA synthesis. We treated cells for 3
h with increasing concentration of CX-5461. All cell
lines showed concentration dependent decrease in 45S
pre-rRNA transcript (Fig. 1B).

decrease in proliferation after a 3 day treatment with CX-5461. b. 3 h treatment with CX-5461 reduced 45S pre-rRNA transcript in a dose

CX-5461 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis
in ALL cells

effectiveness of CX-5461 on ALL patient samples
with different cytogenetic translocations. Six ALL
patient samples with varied cytogenetic abnormalities
(Supplementary Table 2) were treated with DMSO or
1 μM CX-5461 for 48 h and analyzed for the induction
of apoptosis using Annexin V staining (Fig. 2D). The
drug treated samples showed increased apoptosis
compared to DMSO treated patient samples. All but one
(MLL-AF4) CX-5461 treated sample show less than
50% viability compared to their DMSO treated control.
We then checked for a therapeutic window for the drug.
We treated bone marrow from three healthy individuals
with 1 μM CX-5461 for 2 days (Fig. 2D). Normal
cells showed minimal cell death at this concentration.
This shows that  there is a therapeutic window for
treatment with CX-5461 without appreciable toxicity to
healthy cells.

We next investigated if CX-5461 induced
inhibition of proliferation is due to cell death. We
treated SEM, KOPN-8, RS4;11 and NALM-6 cells with
0.25 μM CX-5461 or DMSO control and measured the
induction of apoptosis by Annexin V staining. CX-5461
induced apoptosis in all four ALL cell lines compared
to their respective DMSO treated controls (Fig. 2A).
Further, western blot analysis showed increased levels
of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in CX-5461
treated ALL cell lines (Fig. 2B). To check if CX-5461
induced apoptosis is dependent on caspases, we used
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Pre-treatment
with Z-VAD-FMK significantly reduced annexin
V staining in CX-5461 treated cells confirming caspasedependent  apoptosis (Fig. 2C). We then tested  the

bone marrow (n = 3) were treated with 1 μM CX-5461 or DMSO for 2 days and apoptosis was measured with Annexin V staining. Viable

CX-5461 induced apoptosis is p53 independent

we treated two p53 wild-type (RS4;11 and NALM-6)
and two  p53 mutant cell lines (SEM and KOPN-8)
with CX-5461 (Cosmic database and IARC p53
mutation database). Three of these cell lines (RS4;11,
NALM-6, KOPN-8) showed significant increase in
expression of p53 and p21 (a p53 downstream target
gene), whereas SEM cells showed minimal increase
in p53 or p21 expression upon CX-5461 treatment
(Fig. 3A). We further confirmed p53 independent effect
of CX-5461 on cellular apoptosis using p53 inhibitor
pifithrin-α. As shown in Fig. 3B, pre-treatment of p53
wild-type cell line RS4;11 with pifithrin-α substantially
reduced p53 activation upon CX-5461 treatment
(Fig.  3B). However, this reduced p53 activation had
only a modest effect on CX-5461 mediated apoptosis
(Fig. 3C). Similar result was seen with another p53
wild type cell line NALM-6 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This suggests that p53-independent pathways are more
dominant in CX-5461 mediated apoptosis in ALL.

Inhibition of rRNA synthesis has been shown to
cause nucleolar stress that leads to p53 stabilization
and p53-dependent apoptosis [19, 20]. An earlier report
showed that p53 wild-type melanoma cell line A375
showed only modest induction of p53 upon treatment
with CX-5461, even at a concentration 10 fold higher
than its IC50 for RNA Pol I inhibition and viability [14].
That report did not find any correlation between p53
status and CX-5461 sensitivity in solid cancer cell lines.
In hematological malignancies, however, there was a
suggestion that p53 wild-type cells are more sensitive to
CX-5461 treatment than mutant p53 cells. A subsequent
report showed that p53 wild-type B-lymphomas
are at least 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive to
CX-5461 than p53 mutant B-lymphoma cells, and
apoptosis in these cells is p53-dependent [18]. To check
if CX-5461-induced apoptosis is p53-dependent in ALL,

Figure 3: CX-5461 mediated apoptosis is p53 independent. a. Two p53 wild type (NALM-6 and RS4;11) and two mutant (SEM
and KOPN-8) cell lines were used. Expression of p53 and its downstream target p21 was shown with western blot upon 1 day treatment
with 0.25 μM CX-5461. b, c. p53 wild type RS4;11 cells were treated with 0.25 μM CX-5461 or 30 μM of p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α or
both. Western blot was used to measure p53 levels after 1 day drug treatment (b). Annexin V was used to measure apoptosis after 2 days.

CX-5461 arrests cells in G2-phase of cell cycle

checkpoint kinase CHK1 and CHK2 as wells as pCDC2
levels. We then used specific ATR and ATM inhibitor
VE-822 and KU-60019, respectively, to decipher the
relative contribution of these kinases in this G2 phase
arrest. VE-822 has an IC50 of 19  nM and 2.6 μM for
ATR and ATM inhibition respectively while KU-60019
has an IC50 of 6 nM and > 10 μM for ATM and ATR
respectively [24, 25]. pCHK1(S317) and pCHK2(T68) are
used as a measure of inhibition of ATR and ATM kinase
activity. We treated SEM cells with 100 nM VE-822 and
250 nM KU-60019 alone and in combination with 250 nM
CX-5461 and measured the levels of pCHK1 and pCHK2
by flow cytometry (Fig. 5C, 5D). VE-822 substantially
reduced pCHK1 but showed no effect on pCHK2 levels
induced by CX-5461 treatment. Similarly KU-60019
reduced the levels of pCHK2 with only a modest effect
on pCHK1 levels. We then investigated if these specific
ATM/ATR inhibitors will abrogate CX-5461 induced G2
arrest. Pre-treatment with ATR inhibitor VE-822 relieved
CX-5461-induced G2 arrest whereas ATM inhibitor
KU-60019 had no effect on G2 inhibition (Fig. 5E).

To further understand the mechanism responsible
for CX-5461 induced anti-proliferative effects, we
analyzed the cell-cycle profile of CX-5461 treated ALL
cells. We treated one p53 mutant (SEM) and one p53
wild type (NALM-6) cell lines with CX-5461 for one
day and analyzed the cell-cycle distribution. Both cell
lines showed G2/M phase arrest as shown by cell cycle
distribution of propidium iodide stained cells (Fig. 4A).
To differentiate between G2 and M phase arrest, we looked
at mitosis specific histone H3 phosphorylation in these
cells. Histone H3 is phosphorylated at multiple sites at the
onset of mitosis (Ser 10 and 28) and is used as an M phase
marker [21]. We used nocodazole which arrests cells in
metaphase stage of mitosis as a control. Cell cycle analysis
showed G2/M phase arrest of cells treated with only CX5461, only nocodazole or both (Fig.  4A). As expected,
cells treated with nocodazole showed marked increase in
pH3(S28) signal (Fig. 4B). However, CX-5461 treated
cells showed no increase in pH3 (S28) (Fig. 4B). Similar
results were obtained with pH3(S10) antibody in SEM
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). We further confirmed these
results by checking the levels of cyclin B, pCDC2(Y15)
and pH3(S28) with western blot (Fig. 4C, Supplementary
Fig. 3). Cyclin B expression varies during cell-cycle with
the highest expression during G2/M phase. While cyclin
B was high in both CX-5461 and nocodazole treated cells,
pH3(S28) was only detected in nocodazole treated cells
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, 3 h CX-5461 pre-treatment followed
by nocodazole for 24  h did not lead to any increase in
pH3(S28) suggesting that CX-5461 treatment activates the
cellular machinery that inhibits their entry into M phase
(Fig. 4B, 4C).

ATR inhibitor enhances CX-5461
mediated apoptosis
ATM/ATR inhibitors are shown to be effective in
combination with radiotherapy/chemotherapy in inducing
cell death. As G2 arrest allows cells to recover from the
cellular stress, we tested ATM and ATR inhibitors in
combination with CX-5461 to check if they will lead
to more robust cell killing. Both the inhibitors showed
minimal cell killing when used alone. While KU-60019 in
combination with CX-5461 did not show any appreciable
change in cell killing compared to CX-5461 alone, the
combination of VE-822 and CX-5461 showed a marked
increase in apoptosis compared to CX-5461 alone (Fig. 6A).
We then tested if ATR inhibitor can sensitize these cells to a
lower dose of CX-5461. We treated cells with a lower dose
of VE-822 and CX-5461 that showed minimal cell death. At
50 nM, VE-822 and CX-5461 showed minimal induction
of apoptosis when used alone but their combination greatly
increased cell killing (Fig. 6B).

CX-5461 activates ATM/ATR pathway
To explore the mechanism of CX-5461 mediated
G2 arrest, we checked for the involvement of checkpoint
kinases. Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATMRad3-related (ATR) are responsible for the activation
of checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 in response to
cellular stress [22]. These checkpoint kinases induce G2
arrest in response to cellular stress by maintaining the
inhibitory CDC2(Y15) phosphorylation that prevents
entry into M phase. To test the involvement of ATM/
ATR in CX-5461 mediated G2 arrest, we pre-treated
cells with ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine [23]. As shown in
Fig. 5A, pre-treatment with caffeine completely abolished
CX-5461 mediated G2 arrest. Western blot analysis of
SEM  cells show that CX-5461 increased pCHK1 and
pCHK2 levels as wells as pCDC2 (Y15), indicating
the activation of ATM/ATR pathway upon inhibition of
rRNA synthesis (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, caffeine pretreatment reduced cyclin B levels, reduced activation of

DISCUSSION
Nucleolus is the most prominent sub-nuclear
structure and the site of ribosome production in the
cell. Many chemotherapeutic drugs used currently
like actinomycin D, doxorubicin, camptothecin and
5-fluorouracil disrupt ribosome biogenesis. Burger et al.
[26] suggested that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis may
contribute to the efficacy of these drugs. Until recently
it was difficult to conclude that ribosome biogenesis is a
bona fide target for cancer therapy as these drugs are not
selective for inhibition of rRNA synthesis alone. With the

discovery of selective rRNA synthesis inhibitors, CX-5461
and BMH-21, nucleolus is again at the forefront of novel
cancer targets [14, 15, 18].
Multiple studies have shown that inhibition of RNA
Pol I transcription by inactivation of components of preinitiation complex or by low dose actinomycin D cause
nucleolar stress and disintegration [4, 19]. Nucleolar
components are dispersed in nucleoplasm leading to p53
stabilization and cell-cycle arrest. Knockdown of POLR1A

gene, the catalytic subunit of RNA Pol I, downregulates
E2F-1 expression and accumulate cells in G1 phase [27].
Similarly, deletion of the transcription initiation factor
1A (TIF-1A), a RNA Pol I specific coactivator, leads to
G1 arrest [19]. In case the cells are unable to overcome
this stress, it leads to apoptosis. Our results also support
early changes in cell-cycle modulators upon inhibition of
rRNA synthesis as two hour pre-treatment with CX-5461
was enough to inhibit entry into mitosis in presence of

inhibitor VE-822 led to enhanced apoptosis.
Nucleolus is a dynamic organelle and many of its
constituents shuttle between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Many of the proteins are sequestered in the nucleolus and
are released only in response to certain stimuli [28, 29]. It is
possible that untimely release of these nucleolar components
by CX-5461 treatment results in G2 arrest and apoptosis.

rRNA transcription is cell cycle regulated being highest
during late G1 to G2 phase and sharply decrease as the cell
prepares to enter mitosis [30, 31]. This mirrors nucleolar
assembly and disassembly as nucleolus is disassembled
at the onset of mitosis and start to reassemble during

telophase. It would be interesting to see if CX-5461 will
show cell-cycle dependent cytotoxicity correlated with the
rate of rRNA synthesis or will CX-5461 be effective in cells
arrested in mitosis as rRNA synthesis is suppressed during
mitosis. This will be especially important in a scenario where
18101

Western blot

CX-5461 is used in combination with mitotic inhibitors
like taxanes or vinca alkaloids. In this context, Wu et al. [32]
showed that late S and G2 phase cells are most sensitive
to actinomycin D treatment while mitotic cells were
resistant.
In summary, we have shown that ALL cells are
more sensitive to rRNA synthesis inhibition compared to
normal bone marrow cells. This sensitivity is independent
of their p53 status. More-over, CX-5461 activates ATM/
ATR pathway leading to G2 phase arrest in these cells.
This cell-cycle arrest provides time for cells to recover
from drug induced stress and overcoming this G2 arrest
by inhibiting ATR kinase leads to robust cell killing.
Finally, ATR inhibitor can sensitize ALL cells to a lower
CX-5461dose thereby potentially reducing its side effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell proliferation and apoptosis

Cell lines and patient samples

Cells were seed in 96 well plates and incubated in
DMSO (control) or different concentration of CX-5461 for
3 days. CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
solution (Promega) was added to each well and incubated
for 1 h at 37°C in dark. Absorbance was recorded at
490 nm using Bio-Rad microplate reader. Results were
background subtracted and normalized to DMSO treated
control. Experiment was repeated three times and results
were plotted as mean +/− S.D.
Annexin V was used for measuring apoptosis
(BD Biosciences). Patient samples or cell lines were
seeded in 6 well plates and incubated with DMSO or
CX-5461. After 48 to 72 h cells were harvested, washed
in PBS and suspended in Annexin V binding buffer.
Annexin V was added to each sample and incubated
in dark for 30 min. Cells were analyzed on BD
FACScaliber flow cytometer. Results were normalized
to control and plotted as mean +/− S.D. of three separate
experiments.

RS4;11, REH, MUTZ-5, 697, SEM, KOPN-8
and NALM-6 cell lines were purchased from German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ).
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
institutional review board guidelines for the patient
samples and normal bone marrow samples used in this
study. Patient samples were layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque
density gradient centrifugation and enriched blasts were
stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. The diagnosis
of ALL was based on morphology and flow cytometric
analysis on immunophenotype. Cytogenetic was
determined by standard procedures. Cell lines and patient

Cells were pre-treated with caffeine, VE-822 or
KU-60019 for 1 h followed by CX-5461 treatment. For
nocodazole experiment, cells were pre-treated with
CX-5461 for 2 h followed by nocodazole treatment.
After drug treatments, cells were fixed in methanol and
stored at −20°C till further processing. For cell-cycle
analysis cells were spin down, washed twice in PBS and
suspended in RNaseA containing propidium iodide (PI)
solution and incubated for half an hour. Cells were run
on BD FACScaliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and final cell-cycle analysis was performed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star). For phospho protein detection, fixed
cells were incubated with pH3(S10)-FITC (Biolegend),
pH3(S28) (Cell Signaling Technology), pCHK1(S317)
(Cell Signaling Technology) or pCHK2(T68) (Cell
Signaling Technology) and analyzed with flow cytometry.
