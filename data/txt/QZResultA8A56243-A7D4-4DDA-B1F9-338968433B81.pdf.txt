Abstract
Tankyrases (TNKS) play roles in Wnt signaling, telomere homeostasis, and mitosis, offering attractive targets
for anticancer treatment. Using unbiased combination screening in a large panel of cancer cell lines, we have
identiﬁed a strong synergy between TNKS and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in KRAS-mutant cancer cells. Our study
uncovers a novel function of TNKS in the relief of a feedback loop induced by MEK inhibition on FGFR2 signaling
pathway. Moreover, dual inhibition of TNKS and MEK leads to more robust apoptosis and antitumor activity both
in vitro and in vivo than effects observed by previously reported MEKi combinations. Altogether, our results show
how a novel combination of TNKS and MEK inhibitors can be highly effective in targeting KRAS-mutant cancers
by suppressing a newly discovered resistance mechanism. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3294–305. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) constitute a family of
enzymes that use NADþ to catalyze the addition of poly(ADPribose) chains to target proteins (1–3). Through this posttranslational modiﬁcation, PARP enzymes regulate the function of a
wide range of cellular responses. Recent identiﬁcation and
characterization of two family members, PARP5A (tankyrase 1)
and PARP5B (tankyrase 2), have fuelled increased interest in
the ﬁeld of PARP biology. These tankyrase (TNKS) isoforms
share a high degree of identity and redundant functions (3, 4).
TNKS differ from other PARP enzymes by the presence of
ankyrin repeats that could mediate their interaction with
multiple proteins (4–6). Several TNKS substrates have been
reported that link TNKS to a variety of biologic roles including
mitosis, telomere homeostasis, and proteasome regulation
(4, 7–12). Studies from our group have also demonstrated that
TNKS positively regulate Wnt signaling through PARsylation of
AXIN1, leading to AXIN1 degradation and b-catenin stabilization (8).
Discovery of roles for TNKS in cellular processes involved in
proliferation and survival has raised the possibility of using
TNKS inhibitors as novel anticancer therapeutics. Highly
selective and potent inhibitors of TNKS (TNKSi) have been
developed and characterized in different cancer models (8, 13–

17), including colorectal cancer in which constitutive Wnt
activity is a major driver of tumor maintenance (18, 19).
However, inhibition of TNKS is not sufﬁcient to fully suppress
Wnt signaling, resulting in only partial tumor growth inhibition (15). Several reports have also shown that the antitumor
effect following TNKS inhibition is more robust under serumdeprived conditions (8, 15, 20, 21), raising the possibility that
TNKS inhibition may be more effective when combined with
other therapies. This idea is supported by two studies reporting
that TNKS inhibition could alleviate resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non–small lung cancer cell lines and potentiates
colorectal cancer cell response to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (22, 23). Importantly, these two combination activities
were shown to be associated with the role of TNKS in modulating Wnt signaling.
Here, we asked if we could identify additional combination
partners of TNKSi using an unbiased screening approach. The
discovery of key genes or pathways that cooperate with a
TNKSi in suppressing tumor growth will not only bring additional insights on the biologic functions of TNKS, but will also
more importantly provide basis for effective therapeutic combination strategies using TNKSi. In this study, we found a
robust combination activity between TNKS and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in multiple cancer cell lines and identiﬁed KRASmutant cells as the best responders. The combination activity
correlates with the ability of TNKSi to release a feedback loop
on FGFR2 signaling induced by MEK inhibition. Moreover, dual
inhibition of TNKS and MEK induces cell death and tumor
regression. Together, our results provide a strong rationale to
test combination therapies with TNKSi and MEKi in KRASmutant cancers.

TNKS and MEK Inhibitor Combination in KRAS Mutant Cancers

authenticated by single-nucleotide polymorphism ﬁngerprinting, and typically used within 20 passages.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo Luminescence
Assay (Promega). One day before compound addition, cells
were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates and incubated
for three days with various concentrations of compounds.
Luminescence was recorded on an EnVision plate reader
(PerkinElmer) and the inhibition of viability relative to
DMSO-treated cells was calculated.
High-throughput combination testing
Combination testing was performed using a large-scale
compound screening platform (24). Cells were plated in triplicate into 384-well plates that have been arrayed with compounds serially diluted at ﬁve concentrations. Cell viability was
determined as described above. Compound combination
effects were scored relative to Loewe dose additivity using a
weighted "Synergy Score" calculation (24).
Partition analysis
Two-population differential analyses were performed to
discover features associated with synergy. The data used were
derived from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia project (25).
The examined feature types included continuous value data
such as gene expression, gene copy number and Amax compound response, and categorical data sets from mutation and
cell line lineage. Continuous and categorical data P values were
calculated using a two-sided Wilcoxon test and a two sided
Fisher exact test respectively. Multiple hypothesis adjustment
of P values was done using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach
within the context of each feature type. Only features with a
FDR P < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
(Promega). All conditions were done in triplicate.
SuperTopFlash assay
SuperTopﬂash (STF) reporter containing 12 T-cell factor
binding sites and luciferase sequence was cloned into pLenti6/
V5-DEST (Life Technologies), and used to generate stable
SW480-STF cells. Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well
plates. Luminescence was measured 24 hours after compound
treatment using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblot analysis was performed using standard methods. Cell pellets were lysed using Cell Signaling Technology Cell
Lysis Buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor
tablets (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma).
Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Material.
siRNA transfection and sensitivity to AZD6244
SW480 cells were reverse transfected using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies). siRNAs were purchased
from Thermo Scientiﬁc (sequences listed in Supplementary

www.aacrjournals.org

Material) and used at a 50 nmol/L ﬁnal concentration. Two
days after transfection, AZD6244 was added in increasing dose
concentrations. Cell viability was measured 3 days later.
Microarray analysis
SW480 cells were treated in duplicate with DMSO, NVPTNKS656, AZD6244 or the combination of both for 4 and 16
hours. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen). Gene expression proﬁling was performed using
Affymetrix U133Plus2 Arrays and data were analyzed as in
(26). Differential analysis was performed by computing fold
changes of treatment to DMSO. The data have been deposited
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession number
GSE55624.
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Real-time PCR was performed as described in (8). Probes for
FGFR2 and the housekeeping gene GUSB (beta-glucuronidase)
were purchased from Life Technologies. All experiments were
performed in triplicates and normalized to GUSB transcript
levels (comparative CT method).
Xenograft studies
Mice were handled in accordance with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) Animal Care and Use
Committee protocols and regulations. A total of 10  106 cells
were inoculated subcutaneously into female athymic nude
mice (20–25 grams; 6- to 8-weeks old; n ¼ 7). Compound
treatment started 10 days after implant when average tumor
volume reached approximately 200 mm3. Animals were administered twice daily with vehicle, NVP-TNKS656 (100 mg/kg,
subcutaneous injection) or AZD6244 (45 mg/kg, oral) for the
duration of the study. Tumor volume was measured using
calipers and calculated as (length  width  width)/2. Tumor
growth inhibition was determined as the percentage change in
tumor volume of treated over control animals (% T/C) at the
end of the study. The percentage regression was determined as
the percentage change in the ﬁnal tumor volume over the
starting tumor volume. Five days after the ﬁrst treatment and 2
hours after the last dose, tumor tissues were excised and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen for biomarker analyses.

Results
Identiﬁcation of TNKS and MEKi combination activity in
KRAS-mutant cancer cells
To identify novel combination partners of TNKS in an
unbiased fashion, we probed the dataset of a large-scale
compound screen in which all pairwise combinations of 107
compounds were screened in 138 cancer cell lines representing
mixed lineages and tumor types (manuscript in preparation).
Each pairwise combination was tested at multiple concentrations using a matrix in which each drug was added either as
single agent or in combination. Combination activity of compound pairs was measured after a 3-day treatment and compared with untreated controls (24). Signiﬁcant synergy scores
were determined on the basis of synergy score P value better
than a formal signiﬁcance of Psignif ¼ 0.001, and Pfdr (false

TNKS and MEK Inhibitor Combination in KRAS Mutant Cancers

discovery rate), the probability adjusted for multiple hypotheses using Benjamini–Hochberg with FDR ¼ 0.01.
Among the different combinations tested containing a
TNKSi, previously reported combinations between inhibitors
of TNKS/EGFR and TNKS/PIK3CA scored as synergistic
combinations, thus validating the data generated by the
screen (Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly, MEKi was identiﬁed as
the second most synergistic combination partner with TNKSi,
after only dasatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1A). Of the
138 cancer cell models tested for TNKSi/MEKi combination,
35 cell lines were identiﬁed with signiﬁcant synergy scores
(Supplementary Table S1). Importantly, dual inhibition of
TNKS and MEK led to a higher synergy score when compared
with reported TNKSi combinations with EGFRi or PI3KCAi
(Fig. 1B; refs. 22, 23). Because MEKis are being investigated in
the clinic in multiple tumor types, we next asked how robust
this novel TNKSi/MEKi combination was when compared
with other known MEKi combinations. Among the 107 combinations tested with MEKi, TNKSi was ranked among the top
MEKi combination partners (Fig. 1C). The overall synergy
score between TNKSi/MEKi was similar to combinations
between MEKi and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors,
such as EGFRi (27), but superior to the reported combinations
between MEKi and PI3K (28), BCL-xL (29), or RAF inhibitors
(Fig. 1D; ref. 30).
To explore in more detail which cancer models were more
likely to respond to TNKSi/MEKi combination, we searched for
genetic features that could associate with combination sensitivity. We separated cell lines that demonstrated strong combination activity (P < Pfdr) from those that did not (P > Psignif),
and performed partition analyses (25). We identiﬁed three
signiﬁcant features enriched in the sensitive group: colorectal
cancer lineage, KRAS mutation, and partial sensitivity to
MEKis (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Table S2). It is worth noting
that both colorectal cancer lineage and partial sensitivity to
MEKis indicate aberrant KRAS signaling. We then looked at the
combination synergy score speciﬁcally in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer models and noted that the TNKSi/MEKi combination now ranked as the most synergistic combination in this
subtype (Fig. 1F), supporting results from the partition analysis. Because of a high number of synergistic cell lines carrying
H- and N-RAS mutations (Supplementary Tables S1 and S3), we
next asked whether all RAS mutations were a genetic feature
enriched in sensitive lines. Using a Kruskal–Wallis statistical
analysis, we observed that either KRAS or all RAS mutations
were indeed signiﬁcantly enriched in synergistic cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Taken together, our unbiased combination screen has identiﬁed a novel combination activity between TNKSi and MEKi,
which is signiﬁcantly enriched in colorectal cancer lineage and
RAS-mutant cancer cells.

Validation of the TNKS and MEKi combination activity in
KRAS-mutant cancer cells
To further validate the results of the compound screen, we
carried out combination viability assays in a panel of 18 KRASmutant cancer cell lines of colorectal or pancreatic lineages
using two highly selective compounds NVP-TNKS656 and
AZD6244 to inhibit TNKS and MEK activity respectively (Supplementary Table S4; refs. 17, 31). Cells were treated for three
days with increasing doses of inhibitor alone or in combination. Synergy scores and isobolograms were generated to
quantify the combination strength. A synergy score higher
than 2 was considered as signiﬁcant when compared with the
variation of synergy scores seen within self-crosses (drug-withself; theoretical synergy score of 0). Of the 18 lines tested, nine
showed combination activity with a >2 synergy score (Fig. 2A
and Supplementary Table S5). Dose matrices and isobolograms
in ﬁve most synergistic and ﬁve negative cell lines are represented in Supplementary Fig. S2. It is important to note that
only a fraction of the compound dilution curve was tested in
the large-scale screen, leading to incomplete dose matrices,
whereas in the validation studies full dose matrices were tested
using a wider range of compound concentrations. This may
account for the higher synergy scores obtained in our validation studies as compared with those measured in the screen.
Altogether, data from both studies demonstrated that a subset
of KRAS-mutant cancer cells exhibited strong response to
TNKSi/MEKi combination.
Consistent in both studies, the colorectal cancer SW480
model showed the highest level of synergy in response to
combination treatment (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3A
and S3B). In this cell line, treatment with MEKi led to a growth
inhibition of approximately 50% at the highest concentration
tested, whereas single TNKSi treatment had minimal effect in
inhibiting cell growth. Combination of the two agents led to an
enhanced antiproliferative effect at all doses tested (Fig. 2B,
left). The corresponding isobologram demonstrates that the
combination activity was the consequence of a strong synergy
between both compounds rather than a dose-additive effect of
the single agents, as illustrated by the blue curve of the
combination response deviating strongly below the red line
of additivity (Fig. 2B, right). In addition, we found that the
TNKSi/MEKi combination activity was associated with
marked induction of apoptosis as measured by caspase assay.
Neither single agent altered caspase activity, whereas dual
inhibition of TNKS and MEK strongly induced an apoptotic
response in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C).
To conﬁrm the on-target effect of TNKSi, we asked whether
depletion of TNKS via genetic knockdown could phenocopy
the effect of its pharmacologic inhibition. SW480 cells were
transfected with nontargeting siRNA, single siRNAs targeting
TNKS1 or TNKS2, or a mixture of both. We have previously

TNKS and MEK Inhibitor Combination in KRAS Mutant Cancers

demonstrated that these siRNAs lead to speciﬁc TNKS targeting, and depletion of both TNKS1/2 is required to fully suppress
the TNKS function (8). In this study, both siRNAs led to
effective reduction of TNKS transcripts by 65% to 80% (Fig.
2D, right). Effect of TNKS depletion on cell viability was
assessed following treatment with DMSO or MEKi. Cell growth
was not signiﬁcantly affected by depletion of either TNKS (Fig.
2D, MEKi at 0 mmol/L). Importantly, depletion of both TNKS
but not of single isoforms enhanced the antiproliferative effect
of MEKi at all concentrations, supporting that TNKS inhibition
potentiated MEKi activity (Fig. 2D, left). In comparison, MEKi
combination with the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib did not show
any enhanced activity compared with single agents, further
demonstrating the speciﬁcity of TNKS inhibition in the regulation of MEKi activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
In conclusion, our data strongly support a robust and
speciﬁc combination activity between TNKSi and MEKi in a
subset of KRAS-mutant cancer models.
TNKSi and MEKi synergy is independent of TNKS role in
Wnt signaling
The TNKSi/MEKi combination activity in several colorectal
cancer lines led us to ask whether modulation of Wnt pathway
activity by TNKS inhibition was required for the synergy, as it
was observed with two previously reported TNKSi combinations (22, 23).
We measured Wnt pathway activity in SW480 cells stably
expressing a Wnt luciferase reporter (STF). Cells were treated
with DMSO or inhibitors at 1 and 10 mmol/L (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of TNKS decreased Wnt signaling activity by approximately 20%, consistent with the previous ﬁndings that TNKS
inhibition was not sufﬁcient to fully block Wnt pathway

activity in APC-mutant cancer cells (8, 15). Notably, MEK
inhibition increased Wnt signaling by 30%, a result that might
reﬂect a cross-talk between the MAPK and Wnt pathways (32,
33). As a consequence, the combined treatment did not further
inhibit Wnt activity as compared with TNKSi alone.
TNKS inhibition leads to reduced Wnt pathway activity
through AXIN stabilization and the consequent reduction in
b-catenin levels (8). Therefore, we asked whether b-catenin
depletion would recapitulate the effect of TNKS inhibition and
sensitize cells to MEK inhibition. SW480 cells were transfected
with nontargeting siRNA or two different siRNAs targeting
b-catenin that have been validated in our previous studies (8).
Cell viability was assessed after treatment with DMSO or
increasing concentrations of MEKi. In contrast with what was
observed with TNKS depletion (Fig. 2D), depletion of b-catenin
had no effect on the cellular response to MEK inhibition (Fig.
3B and C).
In line with these data, the partition analysis did not identify
enrichment of Wnt-related features (e.g., mutations in APC or
b-catenin) in TNKSi/MEKi sensitive cell lines (Supplementary
Table S2). We also did not observe any combination activity
between MEKi and the Porcupine inhibitor NVP-LGK974 that
blocks Wnt ligand secretion and signaling activity (Supplementary Fig. S3D; ref. 34).
Taken together, these results indicate that TNKS role in Wnt
signaling is not required for TNKSi/MEKi combination activity.
Inhibition of TNKS potentiates MEKi activity by releasing
a FGFR2 signaling feedback loop
In KRAS-mutant cancer cells, MEK inhibition can induce
feedback mechanisms, resulting in enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling and resistance to MEKi treatment (28, 35–37). To

determine whether derepressed AKT activity might be linked
to TNKSi/MEKi synergy, we compared the effects of TNKSi/
MEKi and PI3KCAi/MEKi combinations on AKT signaling
activity and cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). MEK inhibition increased phosphorylated AKT levels as
expected. Interestingly, dual inhibition of TNKS and MEK led
to a more sustained inhibition of AKT signaling, increased
apoptosis, and more robust synergy compared with PIK3CAi/
MEKi combination, consistent with the large combination
screen data (Fig. 1D).
The more marked synergy between TNKSi and MEKi raised
the possibility that TNKS inhibition may potentiate MEKi
activity via additional mechanisms. To investigate this, we
analyzed the transcriptional response compared with DMSO in
SW480 cells treated with TNKSi, MEKi, or both. To control for
secondary effects arising from impaired cell proliferation,
samples were collected at early time points (4 and 16 hours;
Supplementary Fig. S5A). We observed that inhibition of TNKS
alone did not signiﬁcantly affect gene expression, whereas
signiﬁcant differences were observed at 16 hours after MEKi
or TNKSi/MEKi treatment. To identify genes differentially
expressed between single agents and the combination, we
selected those with a signiﬁcant fold change of expression in

the combination compared with the additive effect of TNKSi
and MEKi as single agents (Fig. 4A). This ﬁltering analysis
highlighted one interesting pattern of gene regulation that
included a gene cluster upregulated after MEKi treatment but
not in the combination. Of the ﬁve genes in this cluster, FGFR2
was of particular interest, as several RTKs have been implicated in feedback loops induced by MEK inhibition (27, 38). To
validate the microarray results, we measured FGFR2 mRNA
and observed that MEKi increased FGFR2 mRNA expression as
early as 4 hours after treatment, and combined inhibition of
TNKS and MEK blocked this upregulation by 16 hours (Fig. 4B).
We observed similar responses for both FGFR2 isoforms, IIIb
and IIIc (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
To determine whether upregulation of FGFR2 transcript
level was accompanied by increased FGFR2 protein and induction of downstream signaling, we measured protein levels of
FGFR2 as well as phospho-FRS2 (pFRS2), a direct downstream
effector of FGF receptors (Fig. 4C). MEKi treatment increased
FGFR2 protein level that was reduced by the combination in a
time-dependent manner. Consistent with the modulation of
FGFR2 mRNA and protein levels, phosphorylation of FRS2 was
induced by MEK inhibition, which was modestly decreased
following the combination treatment at 24 hours (Fig. 4C), and

Altogether, our ﬁndings suggest a novel feedback loop of
cellular response to MEK inhibition through FGFR2 regulation.
MEKi treatment leads to upregulation of FGFR2 expression
and signaling that are suppressed by the addition of TNKSi.
Downregulation of FGFR2 signaling by TNKS inhibitor
correlates with TNKSi and MEKi combination activity
Following our ﬁndings in SW480, we examined whether the
ability of TNKS inhibition to downregulate MEKi-induced
FGFR2 and pAKT expressions were common mechanisms
mediating the synergy in other cancer cell models. We analyzed
FGFR2 mRNA expression as well as FGFR2 and AKT pathway
activities in a larger panel of synergistic and nonsynergistic cell
lines (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6).
All cell lines tested, with the exception of SW403, showed an
increase of FGFR2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels,
as well as elevated pFRS2 following MEKi treatment (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. S6). This indicates that upregulation of
FGFR2 signaling could be a common feedback mechanism in
response to MEK inhibition. What seemed to be distinct
between the synergistic and nonsynergistic cell lines was their
response to TNKSi/MEKi combination. In the four synergistic
models tested, the combined treatment led to signiﬁcant
decreases in FGFR2 at both mRNA and protein levels, and
correspondingly in pFRS2 (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S6A). In contrast, in the nonsynergistic cell lines, combination of MEKi and TNKSi showed no or little effect in reducing
FGFR2 or pFRS2 levels (Fig. 5C and D). In addition, the
synergistic cell lines showed a trend toward higher induction

of apoptosis after inhibition of TNKS and MEK compared with
the nonsynergistic ones, as measured by both increased
expression of cleaved PARP and caspase activity (Fig. 5B and
D and Supplementary Fig. S6C).
We also measured AKT signaling following inhibitor
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In contrast
with FGFR2 signaling, there was no consistent correlation
between suppression of AKT pathway activity and sensitivity
to TNKSi/MEKi combination, indicating that inhibition of
PI3K/AKT signaling was not sufﬁcient to drive synergy
between TNKS and MEK inhibitors in these additional
models.
Our results show that the ability of TNKSi to suppress MEKiinduced FGFR2 upregulation correlates with cancer cell sensitivity to TNKSi/MEKi treatment.
FGFR2 upregulation mediates resistance to MEKi
treatment
We next asked whether inhibition of FGFR2 using a FGFR
inhibitor (FGFRi) would potentiate MEKi activity as does
TNKS inhibition. The two synergistic cell lines, SW480 and
CL11, and the nonsynergistic cell line SW837 were treated with
speciﬁc inhibitors (Supplementary Table S4), either as single
agents or in combination. Cell growth was measured after a 3day treatment. Our data showed that FGFRi treatment effectively blocked FGFR2 signaling and signiﬁcantly enhanced
MEKi activity only in the synergistic cell lines, supporting that
activation of FGFR signaling could be a resistance mechanism
to MEK inhibition (Fig. 6A). The TNKSi/MEKi combination

TNKS and MEK Inhibitor Combination in KRAS Mutant Cancers

showed a more robust activity compared with the FGFRi/MEKi
in the synergistic cell lines, possibly due to higher induction of
apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A and B).
In conclusion, our data support that FGFR2 signaling is a
novel resistance mechanism to MEK inhibition, and suppression of this upregulation leads to enhanced cancer cell
response to MEKi treatment.

inhibition led to an induction of FGFR2 mRNA expression,
which was abrogated by the combined treatment, similar to
what has been observed in vitro (Fig. 7C).
This result demonstrated that the TNKSi/MEKi combination activity could be recapitulated in the SW480 model in
vivo, showing tumor regression and suppression of FGFR2
feedback.

TNKSi and MEKi combination leads to enhanced
antitumor activity in vivo
Having observed a robust synergy for TNKSi/MEKi combination in vitro, we examined whether this effect could be
observed in vivo. Mice bearing SW480 xenograft tumors were
treated twice daily with vehicle, single agents, or the combination. Tumor growth was monitored for 14 days (Fig. 7A).
Consistent with a lack of cellular efﬁcacy, TNKSi treatment did
not show signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth. In agreement with
in vitro results, MEKi led to a signiﬁcant but incomplete tumor
growth inhibition (T/C ¼ 19%), whereas dual inhibition of
TNKS and MEK led to tumor regression (Regression ¼ 29%).
We also measured the tumor pharmacodynamics response to
inhibitor treatment. TNKSi and MEKi treatment led to AXIN
stabilization and decreased ERK phosphorylation, conﬁrming
target inhibition in vivo (Fig. 7B). More importantly, MEK

Discussion
Alterations in key signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation and survival are a hallmark of cancer. Better understanding of the genetic abnormalities that drive tumor formation and progression has brought more effective targeted
therapeutics. However, despite the development of highly
selective inhibitors targeting these genetic drivers, the efﬁcacy
of single-agent therapies has been hampered by tumor heterogeneity and development of resistance (39, 40). Delineation
of these mechanisms is necessary to pave the way for rationally
designed and more effective combination therapies. In this
report, through both unbiased large-scale compound combination screen and mechanistic delineation, we demonstrated a
novel and robust combination activity between TNKS and
MEK inhibitors via modulation of FGFR2 signaling in a subset
of RAS-mutant cancer cells.

RAS mutations occur at high frequency in cancers, notably
colorectal, pancreatic, and lung lineages (41). However, targeting RAS directly has been met with drugability challenges.
Inhibition of MEK, the most proximal downstream effector of
RAS, has not shown the anticipated antitumor activity in
mutant RAS tumors, due to cross-talks with other signaling
pathways and feedback mechanisms. Many efforts have been
made to understand the mechanisms of resistance and to
develop more robust targeted therapies for these cancers, as
exempliﬁed by promising results seen in several KRAS-mutant
cancer models using combination of MEKi with PIK3CA or
BCL-xl inhibitors (28, 29, 36). Nevertheless, this is still not
curative; combined inhibition of MEK and PIK3CA leads to
tumor stasis rather than regression and shows toxicity at
efﬁcacious doses (36, 42). Our study has led to the identiﬁcation
of a novel combination activity between TNKS and MEK
inhibitors that lead to more robust anticancer activities than
the aforementioned MEKi combinations. We plan to further
assess the efﬁcacy of TNKSi/MEKi combination in vivo using
xenograft models of primary tumors derived from patients
with colorectal cancer carrying oncogenic KRAS mutations.
Our data show that TNKSi/MEKi combination activity does
not involve TNKS role in modulating Wnt signaling activity.
Our ﬁndings in multiple KRAS-mutant models rather highlight
a novel function of TNKS in relieving a feedback loop induced
by MEK inhibition on FGFR2 signaling cascade. It remains to
be determined how TNKS inhibition leads to suppression of
FGFR2 transcription. The molecular mediators of TNKS effect
on FGFR2 expression, including the potential role of TNKS
substrates in this pathway, await future studies. A better
understanding of this new role of TNKS could help to further
dissect TNKS biology and bring opportunities to target FGFR2dependent cancers and other diseases.
The more robust synergy observed between TNKSi and
MEKi combination may be attributed to a stronger induction
of cell death. MEK inhibition upregulates the expression of the
proapoptotic protein BIM, providing rationale for combination
between BCL-xL and MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cells
(29, 43). We also observed that MEKi treatment increased BIM
expression in the cellular models tested. However, we did not
observe any effect of TNKSi on BIM, MCL-1, or BCL-xL
expression or interaction. We are currently exploring whether

other mediators in the apoptotic pathway may be modulated
by TNKSi/MEKi combination.
In conclusion, our work has identiﬁed a novel feedback
regulatory mechanism upon MEKi treatment in KRAS-mutant
cells through induction of FGFR2 expression and signaling.
More importantly, TNKS inhibition greatly potentiates MEKi
activity by relieving this feedback loop in a subset of KRASmutant cancer cells. Overall, our ﬁndings not only provide an
additional therapeutic opportunity for treating KRAS-mutant
tumors, but also shed new light on TNKS biology.
