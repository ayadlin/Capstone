ABSTRACT
Wnt signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in a variety of cancers, especially
in colorectal cancer and small molecule antagonists of Wnt/β-catenin signaling are
attractive candidates for developing effective therapeutics. In the present study, we
identified Bisleuconothine A, a bisindole alkaloid with an eburnane-aspidosperma
type skeleton, as a novel and selective Wnt signaling inhibitor by using a cell-based
luciferase assay system. Our study found that Bisleuconothine A down-regulated
the endogenous Wnt target gene expression through promoting phosphorylation of
β-catenin and the subsequent inhibition of its nuclear translocation in HCT116 and
SW480 colorectal cancer cells. In vitro, Bisleuconothine A inhibited cell proliferation
through induction of apoptosis by increasing the cleavage of caspases in HCT116
and SW480 colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, in vivo, Bisleuconothine A dramatically
suppressed tumor growth in HCT116 Xenograft. And further analysis showed that
Bisleuconothine A suppressed the Wnt target gene expression in HCT116 Xenograft,
which was associated with up-regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent
Wnt signaling inhibition. Taken together, our study indicated that bisindole alkaloids
could be included as a new chemotype of small-molecule Wnt signaling inhibitors,
and have great potential to be further developed for anti-tumor agents.

and targets β-catenin for the subsequent ubiquitination
and proteasome degradation, and thereby maintaining
low baseline cytosolic levels. Binding of Wnt proteins
to Frizzled receptors inhibits GSK-3β and induces the
disassembly of destruction complex and release of
β-catenin, leading to accumulated cytoplasmic β-catenin
and increased translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus,
where it binds to the T-cell factor (TCF)/Lymphoid
enhancer-binding factor (LEF) family of transcription
factors [2, 3].
Mutations or deregulated expression of components
of the Wnt pathway can induce diseases, most importantly
cancer [4]. Over 94% of colorectal cancer cells have
mutations in one or more members of the Wnt signaling

INTRODUCTION
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in a multitude
of developmental processes and the maintenance of
adult tissue homeostasis, as well as maintaining adult
stem cells in a pluripotent state [1]. Wnts are a family of
extracellular ligands that trigger a wide range of cellular
responses upon receptor binding and activation [2]. In
the absence of Wnt proteins, β-catenin is recruited into a
destruction complex comprising adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC), Axin, kinases casein kinase 1 (CKI) and
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The destruction
complex mediates sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin
at S45 by CK1α and then at T41, S37 and S33 by GSK3

pathway [5], of which 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers
are associated with mutation of APC and 10% with
mutation of CTNNB1, the gene encoding the protein of
β-catenin [4]. Aberrant TCF/β-catenin signaling activity
leads to the formation of cancer by altering expression of
target genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation,
migration and apoptosis [6], such as, Axin 2 [7], survivin
[8], Cyclin D1 and c-Myc [9].
The broad involvement of Wnt signaling in disease
has driven numerous studies to identify novel small
molecules inhibitors that target different regulation
levels of Wnt signaling. Despite of a couple of inhibitors
reported with great potential, the clinical application of
therapies to specifically target the Wnt pathway in cancer
cells is still in infancy [1, 10].
Bisindole alkaloids have received considerable
attention for their potential biological activity, including
anti-tumor [11, 12], antimalarial [13], anti-inflammatory
[14] and antibacterial [15, 16]. In our previous
investigation, we isolated indole alkaloids from plants
of genus Melodinus [12, 17–21], in which more than 200
monoterpenoid indoles with skeletons of aspidosperma,
eburnane, condylocarpan, vincadine, scandine and
bisindoles with two units of eburnane-aspidosperma,
aspidosperma-scandine,
aspidosperma-aspidosperma
were reported with their cytotoxicity evaluation. However,
few investigation on Wnt signaling pathway of bisindole
was reported except cis-dihydroarcyriarubin C with
only moderate inhibition on Wnt signaling transcription,
suggesting that bisindole alkaloids might be novel
candidates for Wnt signaling inhibitors [22]. In the present
study, we identified bisindole alkaloids as Wnt signaling
inhibitor by using a cell-based luciferase assay system,
among which, Bisleuconothine A (BLA) showed the
most potent activity. Bisleuconothine A, a bisindole with
an eburnane-aspidosperma skeleton firstly reported from
the bark of Leuconotis griffithii, exhibited cell growth
inhibitory activity against various human cancer cell lines
[23]. We showed that Bisleuconothine A, as a novel and
selective Wnt signaling inhibitor, had great potential to
be further developed as colorectal cancer therapeutics
targeting the Wnt signaling.

RESULTS

HEK293W cells with Bisleuconothine A resulted in
a dose-dependent decrease in Wnt3a induced ST-Luc
transcription with an IC50 value of 2.55 ± 0.34 μM. To
further confirm the inhibitory effect of Bisleuconothine
A on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, HEK293T cells were
transiently transfected with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
reporter ST-Luc, Wnt1 and Renilla, and then treated
with Bisleuconothine A for 24 h. As shown in Figure
1B, Wnt1 treatment resulted in an increase of the STLuc activity. Of note, Wnt1-induced ST-Luc activity
was significantly decreased under Bisleuconothine A
treatment with a calculated IC50 of 4.94 ± 0.10 μM (Figure
1B). To investigate the selectivity of Bisleuconothine
A on Wnt signaling, the effect of Bisleuconothine A on
NF-κB signaling was tested parallelly. HEK293T cells
were transiently transfected with NF-κB-Luc (Beyotime
Institute for Biotechnology) and Renilla. As shown in
Figure 1C, TNF-α treatment significantly induced NF-κB
transcriptional activity. However, Bisleuconothine A did
not affect TNF-α-activated NF-κB reporter activity (Figure
1C), indicating that Bisleuconothine A preferentially
targets Wnt signaling.
Bisleuconothine A is bisindole condensed by
(+)-ebumamenine and a tabersonine derivative, and the
cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines of their
analogs have been investigated by our group previously
[12, 17–21]. The results suggested that the cytotoxicity of
hydroxyl substituent tabersonine decreased significantly,
and the bioactive bisindole alkaloids invariably displayed
greater potency compared to their monomeric alkaloids.
To investigate the structure-activity relationship of
Bisleuconothine A, we investigated the Wnt inhibition
activities of the two constructive units of Bisleuconothine
A, (+)-ebumamenine and tabersonine. However, neither
of them exhibited Wnt signaling inhibitory activity in
HEK293W cells, compared to Bisleuconothine A.
As a well-known anticancer chemotherapeutics,
vinorelbine is also a bisindole alkaloid with similar
structure with Bisleuconothine A. So we compared the
Wnt signaling inhibitory activities of vinorelbine with
Bisleuconothine A, and the dual-luciferase reporter assay
in HEK293W cells showed that vinorelbine did not exhibit
significant Wnt signaling inhibitory activity, indicating a
novel anti-tumor mechanism of bisindole alkaloids.

To identify additional scaffolds of Wnt/β-catenin

small molecules were screened by using a Wnt/β-catenin
signaling reporter activity assay in HEK293W cells
stably transfected with Wnt3a, Renilla and SuperTopflash
luciferase (ST-Luc) [24]. The screening resulted in several
primary hits, and one of which was Bisleuconothine
A (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1A, incubation of

To test whether Bisleuconothine A attenuates Wnt/βcatenin signaling in Wnt-dependent cancer cells, HCT116
and SW480 cells were transiently transfected with the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter ST-Luc and Renilla. The
elevated ST-Luc activity in HCT116 and SW480 cells,
due to Ser45 deletion mutation in β-catenin [25] and APC
mutation [26], respectively, was significantly decreased
by treatment with Bisleuconothine A (Figure 2A and

next investigated the effect of Bisleuconothine A on the
expression of endogenous Wnt target genes Cyclin D1,

complex [27]. Thus, the protein levels of total β-catenin
and phosphorylated β-catenin were investigated. To
test whether treatment of Bisleuconothine A induces
β-catenin phosphorylation, lysates from cells incubated
with Bisleuconothine A with incremental time of
Bisleuconothine A were subjected to Western blot analysis.

Induction of phosphorylation of β-catenin led to
the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of β-catenin,

pretreatment of HEK293T cells with Bisleuconothine
A inhibited LiCl-induced activation of Wnt signaling.
These results indicated that Bisleuconothine A exerted
their effects at the level of the β-catenin destruction
complex (GSK-3β/AXIN/APC) or upstream of it. As
an inhibitor of GSK-3β, LiCl promoted the nuclear
translocation of β-catenin (Figure 4B). Of note,
pretreatment of HCT116 and SW480 cells with 3 μM
Bisleuconothine A for 6 h dramatically inhibited LiClinduced nuclear translocation of β-catenin. HEK293
cells were transiently transfected with ST-Luc/Renilla
and with plasmids encoding scramble, full-length
β-catenin or β-catenin with S37A (da-Cat). Due to the
mutation of S37, targeting β-catenin for phosphorylation,
ubiquitination and degradation, the β-catenin (S37A)
directly translocated into the nucleus, thereby constantly
activating the Wnt signaling pathway without being
phosphorylated and subsequent degradation [29, 30].
As shown in Figure 4C, the activity of ST-Luc with
transfection of full-length β-catenin was reduced by
incubation with Bisleuconothine A. However, β-catenin
with S37A-induced Wnt activation was not attenuated
by Bisleuconothine A. Thus, Bisleuconothine A
inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway through induction
of phophorylation of β-catenin and subsequent
nucleus translocation inhibition of β-catenin. Besides,
siRNA mediated knock-down of β-catenin reduced
the sensitivity of SW480 cells to Bisleuconothine A
remarkably, deduced from the cell growth curves (the
red curve and the pink curve in Figure 4D), further
confirming that β-catenin is required for the anti-tumor
activity of Bisleuconothine A.

were performed. As shown in Figure 5B, Bisleuconothine
A induced weak G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Besides,
Bisleuconothine A-induced apoptosis was investigated,
and the results showed that Bisleuconothine A exhibited
a markedly concentration- and time- dependent apoptosis
inducing effect on HCT116 and SW480 cells (Figure 5C
and 5D). Additionally, extension of the bisleuconothine
A treatment time increased the percentage of apoptotic
cells (Figure 5E and 5F). With western blotting assay,
our results demonstrated that dose-dependent proteolytic
cleavages of caspase 3, caspase 8, and PARP-1 were
detected in Bisleuconothine A treated HCT116 and SW480
cells (Figure 5G).

Bisleuconothine A sulfate suppressed tumor
growth through downregulation of Wnt
signaling in Xenograft mouse model in vivo
Subcutaneous Xenograft model was used to
investigate the anti-tumor capacity of Bisleuconothine A
in vivo. To increase the water solubility of Bisleuconothine
A, the sulfate of Bisleuconothine A (Bisleuconothine
A-S, BLA-S) (Supplementary Figure 1A) was prepared
and the inhibitory effects of Bisleuconothine A sulfate on
Wnt signaling in HEK293W cells and growth of several
colorectal cancer cells were evaluated (Supplementary
Figure 1B, 1C). As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, the
growth and Wnt inhibitory activity of Bisleuconothine A
sulfate was consistent with that of Bisleuconothine A.
In the in vivo test, 7 days after implantation, the
BALB/c mice carrying established HCT116 Xenograft
were randomly assigned into control and experimental
group. The mice were treated daily with 2 mg/kg of
Bisleuconothine A sulfate by intraperitoneal injection
and injection of normal saline as controls. As shown in
Figure 6A, the experimental group treated with 2 mg/kg
of Bisleuconothine A sulfate did not show toxicity to the
mice as no difference in weight was observed between
control and Bisleuconothine A sulfate-treated mice. While,
relative tumor volume and tumor weight were significantly
decreased with treatment with Bisleuconothine A sulfate
(Figure 6B and 6C). Importantly, the relative tumor
volume was significantly decreased started from 7 days
treatment with 2 mg/kg/d of Bisleuconothine A sulfate
(p<0.05) compared with controls (Figure 6B). At the
end of the experiment, the tumors in control mice grew
to approximately 1750 mm3, whereas the tumors of
mice treated with 2 mg/kg Bisleuconothine A sulfate
were approximately 590 mm3. Meanwhile, tumor weight
(Figure 6C) was reduced by 59% in mice receiving 2 mg/
kg/d of Bisleuconothine A sulfate compared with controls.
These results demonstrate that Bisleuconothine A sulfate
has potent anti-tumor activity in HCT116 colorectal
Xenograft.
Of note, the expression of Wnt target genes Axin 2,
c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and survivin was significantly reduced

Bisleuconothine A inhibited cell proliferation
through induction of apoptosis by increasing the
cleavage of caspases in colorectal cancer cells
Given that Wnt signaling is closely associated with
cell proliferation and Bisleuconothine A can suppress the
Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer cells, we then explored
the effect of Bisleuconothine A on cancer cell proliferation
with MTS assay. As shown in Figure 5A, Bisleuconothine
A inhibited the proliferation of HCT116, SW480, HT29
and SW620 colorectal cancer cells, and the IC50 values
were 2.74 ± 0.22, 3.18 ± 0.08, 1.09 ± 0.06 and 3.05 ± 0.17
μM, which were comparable to those shown to attenuate
the activity of Wnt signaling.
Cyclin D1 is an important regulator of the cell
cycle that is overexpressed in colorectal cancers as a
consequence of activated TCF/β-catenin signaling [31].
Our study found that Bisleuconothine A inhibited Wnt
signaling and its target gene Cyclin D1 protein expression
of in HCT116 and SW480 cells (Figure 2C). To confirm
whether the anti-proliferative effect of Bisleuconothine
A was due to induction of cell cycle arrest, propidium

catenin signaling is frequently activated by mutated APC
or β-catenin, it seems that, for antitumor efficacy, the
ideal antagonist of the pathway would be targeting the
transcriptional complex of TCF and β-catenin. However,
there are recently some studies showing that, at least in
some cases, targeting the upstream components of the
Wnt signaling pathway can also play a role. As the key
component of Wnt signaling, the stabilization of β-catenin
is a potential target, which is regulated by the destruction
complex. Recently, several small molecules targeting the
destruction complex have been discovered. XAV939 [32],
IWR [33], JW55 [34], J67 and J74 [35] increase Axin
levels through inhibiting the activity of tankyrase, while

in the tumor tissues treated with Bisleuconothine A sulfate,
as well as the induction of Ser33/37/41 phosphorylation
of β-catenin (Figure 6D). Collectively, our results indicate
that Bisleuconothine A inhibits tumor growth through
attenuating Wnt signaling.

DISCUSSION
Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway is involved in the development and progression
of various cancers, especially colorectal cancers [4, 9].
Wnt/β-catenin signaling has become a potential target
in cancer treatment. In colorectal cancers where Wnt/β-

the compound Pyrvinium [36] enhances casein kinase to
promote the phosphorylation of β-catenin and disturbs the
stabilization of β-catenin.
Bisleuconothine A, a bisindole alkaloid with an
eburnane-aspidosperma type skeleton, exhibited cell
growth inhibitory activity against various human cancer
cell lines, but little is known about its mechanism of
action [23]. In the present study, by using a reporter gene
system [24], our screening resulted in the identification
of Bisleuconothine A as a novel inhibitor of β-catenin/
TCF transcription activity. The inhibitory effect of
Bisleuconothine A in LiCl-induced cells and in APC
mutant cells indicated that the compound might act on the
destruction complex or upstream this level. The molecular
target of Bisleuconothine A and the detailed mechanisms
needs further investigation.
Bisindole alkaloids, well known as inhibitors
of tubulin polymerization, are extensive in clinical
application, such as Vinblastine and Vincristine, as well as

their derivatives Vindesine and Vinorelbine [37]. Despite
of the similarity in structure, the dual-luciferase assay
showed that Vinorelbine did not exhibit Wnt signaling
inhibitory activity, suggesting Bisleuconothine A inhibits
the Wnt signaling specifically and the mechanism studies
of anti-tumor and Wnt signaling inhibitory activity of
Bisleuconothine A enriched the anti-cancer mechanisms
of bisindole alkaloids.
In conclusion, we identified Bisleuconothine A as a
novel and selective antagonist of Wnt signaling for the first
time and disclosed the mechanism of the anti-proliferative
effect of Bisleuconothine A on colorectal cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo. Bisleuconothine A suppressed Wnt/βcatenin signaling by inhibition of nuclear translocation
of β-catenin via a mechanism dependent of β-catenin
phosphorylation and independent of APC. Taken together,
our study suggested that Bisleuconothine A might be
developed into therapeutic agents against various cancers
bearing aberrant upregulation of Wnt signaling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunofluorescence staining

Cell culture

Cells were grown for 12 h before treatment. Drugtreated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
min. After being washed with PBS, the slides were treated
by 0.1% Triton-X and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Then
the slides were incubated with anti-β-catenin antibody (BD
Biosciences) overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated
with corresponding FITC conjugated secondary antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated
with DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min
and observed under microscopy (Eclipse Ti, Nikon).

The human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116,
SW480, HT29 and SW620) and HEK293T were
purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and
Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China). The cells were grown in medium (DMEM for
HCT116, SW480, SW620 and HEK293T cells, RPMI
1640 medium for HT29), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (HyClone). HEK293W cells
[24] (Wnt3a and luciferases stably transfected) were
cultured in DMEM medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin 100 μg/
ml streptomycin (HyClone), 100 μg/ml G418 (SigmaAldrich) and 100 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Sigma-Aldrich)
as previously reported. All the cells were incubated at
37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation
Collected cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer A
(10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
DTT, pH 7.9, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA)) and incubated on ice for 10 min.
After microcentrifuged, the cells were lysed in buffer A with
0.2% Nonidet P-40 and for 6 minutes on ice. After being
microcentrifuged for 5 min at 500 g, the supernatants were
collected as cytoplasmic extracts. Pellets were washed with
lysis buffer A without NP-40 and resuspended in lysis buffer
B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT,
0.2 mM EDTA, and 25% glycerol), and incubated for 30
min on ice. After being centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min,
supernatants were collected.

Cell transfection and luciferase reporter assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After overnight
culture, for one well, HEK293T cells transiently
transfected with 80 ng Wnt/β-catenin pathway responsive
firefly luciferase reporter plasmid SuperTOPFlash (STLuc), 8 ng of Renilla reporter plasmid (Promega) and 64
ng mouse Wnt1. In HCT116 and SW480 cells, the cells
were transiently transfected with ST-Luc and Renilla.
After 3 h incubation, cells were treated with various
concentrations of Bisleuconothine A for 24 h and then
the cells were lysed. Both luciferase and Renilla activities
were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity was
normalized to the Renilla activity.

Small interfering RNAs
Duplex siRNAs with two thymidine residues (dTdT)
at the 3'-end of sequence were synthesized at GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). The target sequences were as follows
[38]:
CTNNB1: 5'-AGCUGAUAUUGAUGGACAG-3'.
Scrambled
control:
5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3'.
SiRNAs were transfected into SW480 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000.

Western blotting assay
Cells were harvested and lysed in SDS sample
buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH6.8, 10% glycerol, 2%
SDS, 50 mM DTT and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20
and incubated at 4 °C overnight with the following
antibodies: anti-Axin 2, anti-Cyclin D1, anti-c-Myc, antiSurvivin, anti-caspase 3, anti-cleaved caspase 3, anticaspase 8, anti-PARP-1 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Lamin
A/C (Epitomics), anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences), antiphopho-β-catenin (Cell signaling Technology), and against
β-actin (Santa Cruz, CA), followed by the corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Proteins of interest were visualized and imaged under
chemi-luminescent detection using LASmini 4000 (GE
Healthcare).

MTS assay
Cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by MTS
method. Briefly, 5×103 cells were plated in 96-well plates
12 h before treatment and continuously exposed to test
compounds for 48 h. Then MTS (Promega) was added to
each well. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1~4 h
and the optical density (OD) was measured at 490 nm using
a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The IC50 values
are calculated from appropriate dose-response curves.

Cell cycle analysis
HCT116 and SW480 cells (2×105 cells) were
incubated with test compounds for 24 h respectively.

Ccells were collected and washed twice with PBS. Cells
were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed cells
were washed with PBS, and then stained with 50 μg/ml
propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution containing
50 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min in dark at
room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). The percentages of the distributions in distinct
phases of cell cycle were determined using FlowJo V 7.6.1
software.

All animal experiments were carried out under an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocol and institutional guidelines for the proper and
humaneuse of animals. Three-week-old female BALB/cnude Mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory
Animal Technology Co. Ltd, and were kept in a pathogenfree environment. For the HCT116 xenograft, 5×106
HCT116 cells were injected subcutaneously to the right
flank of the BALB/c-nude mice. When the tumors reached
a volume of ~130 mm3, 7 days after implantation, the mice
were randomly assigned into two groups (eight mice in
each group) and treatments were given daily as follows:
(a) intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg Bisleuconothine
A sulfate, or (b) intraperitoneal injection of normal saline.
Tumors were measured in three dimensions using calipers,
and tumor volume (in mm3) was calculated using the
following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (L× W2)/2,
where L= length in mm, and W= width in mm. Body
weight was recorded regularly during the experiment.
After treatments, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors
were isolated. Then the tumors were weighed and frozen
at -80 °C for subsequent western blotting assay.
