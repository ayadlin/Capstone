BACKGROUND: Several grading schemes for the extent of residual tumor in posttreatment pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) specimens have been proposed. However, the prognostic significance of these grading schemes is
unknown. METHODS: Histopathologic slides of 223 cases who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and PD were
reviewed. The extent of residual tumor was graded using both the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the
Evans grading systems. The grading results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival.
RESULTS: Among the 223 patients, 6 patients (2.7%) showed pathologic complete response (pCR; CAP grade 0 or
Evans grade IV), 36 cases (16.1%) had minimal residual tumor (CAP grade 1 or Evans grade III), 124 cases (55.6%) had
moderate response (CAP grade 2 or Evans grade IIb), and 57 cases (25.6%) had poor response (CAP grade 3, where
18 had Evans grade I and 39 had Evans grade IIa response). Patients with pCR or minimal residual tumor (response
group 1) had better survival rates than those with moderate and poor response (response group 2). Response group
1 patients had lower posttherapy tumor and American Joint Committee on Cancer stages and lower rates of lymph
node metastasis, positive resection margin, and recurrence and/or metastasis. Grading the extent of residual tumor is
an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: pCR or minimal residual
tumor in posttreatment PD specimens correlate with better survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy and PD. Histologic grading of the extent of residual tumor in PD specimen
is an important prognostic factor in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant

KEYWORDS: pancreatic cancer, pathologic response, survival, prognosis.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States for both males and females. The estimated number of new cases for pancreatic cancer in 2010 was 43,140, and the number of deaths due to pancreatic cancer was
36,800.1 Surgery offers the only chance for long-term survival. However, 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with locoregionally advanced or metastatic disease and are not suitable for surgical resections.2 The
prognosis for patients with PDAC is poor. Despite significant improvements in surgery, perioperative mortality rates, and adjuvant systemic and radiation therapies, the prognosis for patients with PDAC has not changed significantly over the last 4 decades.3 Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is increasingly used as an alternative to the ‘‘surgery-first’’ approach in treatment of
patients with potentially resectable PDAC, especially for patients with borderline resectable disease, because it potentially
reduces tumor volume and treats early micrometastatic disease, thereby increasing the likelihood of a complete resection.

Extent of Residual PDAC and Prognosis/Chatterjee et al

Few schemes for the histologic grading of the extent
of residual tumor in posttreatment pancreatectomy specimens have been proposed. Ishikawa et al proposed to
group the tumor response into 3 categories based on the
percentage of severely degenerative cancer cells: one-third
or less, one-third to two-thirds, and greater than twothirds.4 Evans et al proposed a 4-tiered grading system for
the extent of residual tumor, based on the grading of residual tumors in other organs, by assessing the percentage of
viable tumor cells (destruction of tumor cells) in the posttreatment pancreatectomy specimens: grade I, little
(<10%) or no tumor cell destruction; grade IIa, destruction of 10% to 50% of tumor cells; grade IIb, destruction
of 51% to 90% of tumor cells; grade III, few (<10%) viable-appearing tumor cells; and grade IV, no viable tumor
cells.5 Similar to the Evans grading system, White et al
also proposed to use the percentage of the residual carcinoma and grouped the tumor response into 3 grades:
‘‘large,’’ >90% viable tumor cells; ‘‘moderate,’’ 10% to
90% viable tumor cells; and ‘‘small,’’ <10% residual
tumor cells, scattered foci of tumor cells, or no residual tumor cells.6 The College of American Pathologists (CAP)
proposes to use a 4-tier grading system for the extent of residual carcinoma in posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens: grade 0, no viable residual tumor (pathologic
complete response [pCR]); grade 1, marked response
(minimal residual cancer with single cells or small groups
of cancer cells); grade 2, moderate response (residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis); and grade 3, poor or no
response (extensive residual cancer).7 White et al showed
in a small cohort of 54 patients that 8 patients who had
large residual tumor load in the pancreatectomy after neoadjuvant therapy had shorter survival than 46 patients
with no tumor or moderate residual tumor load.6 However, the prognostic significance of the grading systems
mentioned above for the extent of residual tumor in posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens is largely unknown.
Validation studies for histologic grading of the extent of
residual tumor are needed.
In this study, we used both the Evans grading system
and the CAP grading protocol to evaluate the extent of
residual tumor in a cohort of 223 patients who received
neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and subsequently
underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Histologic
grading of the extent of residual tumor was correlated
with clinicopathological parameters, disease-free survival
(DFS), and overall survival (OS). We found that patients
with pCR or minimal residual disease (<5% residual
tumor cells) in posttreatment PD specimens had better

Cancer

survival than those patients who had little or moderate
response. In this study, histologic grading of the extent of
residual tumor is an independent prognostic factor for OS.
Thus, histologic grading of the extent of residual tumor in
posttreatment PD specimens is a key prognostic factor of
patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant therapy. A
modified grading system for the extent of residual tumor in
posttreatment pancreatectomy specimens is proposed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Follow-Up
Our study population consisted of 223 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of PDAC who received
neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and subsequently
underwent PD. There were 130 male and 93 female
patients with age ranging from 38.9 to 85.4 years (median
age, 62.9 years). Thirty-nine patients (17.5%) received
neoadjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation
(group 1), 69 patients (30.9%) received neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (group 2), 75 patients
(33.6%) received systemic chemotherapy followed by
gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (group 3), 35 patients
(15.7%) received systemic chemotherapy followed by fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation (group 4), and the
remaining 5 patients (2.3%) received neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy alone (group 5). A total of 144
(64.6%) of these patients (groups 2 and 3) were treated
with previously published protocols.8,9 Upon completion
of neoadjuvant therapy, all patients underwent restaging
evaluation, and PD was performed only in patients with
resectable disease without disease progression or metastasis, and who had no contraindications to major abdominal
surgery. Patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy
for PDAC and those who underwent PD for other types
of pancreatic tumors were excluded.
The clinical and follow-up information through
December 2009 was extracted from a prospectively maintained database at the Department of Surgical Oncology,
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and
verified by reviewing patient medical records and the US
Social Security Index. The first site or sites of disease recurrence were classified as either local/regional or distant
recurrence based on computed tomography (CT) scan.
Biopsy confirmation of metastasis was rarely performed.
Local/regional recurrence was defined as recurrence in the
region of the pancreatic bed, root of mesentery, soft tissues, or lymph nodes adjacent to the pancreatic bed.
Distant metastasis was defined as radiographic evidence of

approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Histologic Grading of the Extent of Residual
Carcinoma in PD Specimens
To exclude the interobserver bias, the archival hematoxylin and eosin slides from all cases were uniformly reviewed
by 1 pathologist (D.C.) for the extent of residual carcinoma,

who has not reviewed the cases prior to this study and was
blinded to all clinical and follow-up information. The grading of the extent of residual carcinoma in PD specimens was
performed using 2 different grading schemes: the grading
protocol recommended by the CAP, which is based on the
ratio of residual tumor cells and the stroma,7 and the grading
scheme reported by Evans et al, which is based on the percentage of residual tumor cells.5 Representative micrographs
for the extent of residual carcinoma in posttreatment PD
specimens using the CAP and Evans grading systems are

shown in Figure 1. The number of slides reviewed from the
pancreas and tumor ranged from 3 to 45 (mean number of
slides: 14). In addition, the gross tumor size, differentiation,
margin status, and lymph node status were also reviewed.
The posttreatment pathologic staging was grouped according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual, 7th edition.10 For all the cases with pCR, the
pretreatment cytology and imaging studies were reviewed.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-square analyses were used to compare categorical data
and analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables. Survival curves were constructed using the KaplanMeier method and the log-rank test was used to evaluate the
statistical significance of differences. DFS was calculated
from the date of surgery to the date of first recurrence after
surgery in patients with recurrence or to the date of last
follow-up in patients without recurrence. OS was calculated

Cancer

from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or the date
of last follow-up if death did not occur. The prognostic
significance of clinical and pathologic characteristics was
determined using univariate Cox regression analysis. Cox
proportional hazards models were fitted for multivariate
analysis. After interactions between the variables were examined, a backward stepwise procedure was used to derive the
best-fitting model. Statistical analysis was performed using
Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (for Windows, version 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). A 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical analyses.

ypT0, ypT1, ypT2 and ypT3, were present in 6 (2.7%),
12 (5.4%), 2 (0.9%), and 203 (91%) of 223 patients,
respectively. For the 6 cases with pCR (ypT0), pretreatment CT scan showed a mass lesion in the head of the
pancreas and the pretreatment cytology diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed in all cases. The number of
regional lymph nodes ranged from 5 to 50 lymph nodes
(median, 21). The number of involved lymph nodes
ranged from 0 to 21 nodes (median, 1). According to the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification standards, 136 of the 217 (62.7%) cases with viable residual
PDAC were well to moderately differentiated and 81
(37.3%) cases were poorly differentiated. R0 resection
was achieved in 199 (89.2%) patients, 24 (10.8%)
patients had microscopic tumor involvement of 1 or more
surgical resection margins (R1); there were no R2 resections. Based on the CAP protocol, 6 (2.7%) cases had complete response (grade 0,), 36 (16.1%) had minimal residual
tumor (grade 1), 124 (55.6%) had moderate response
(grade 2), and 57 (25.6%) cases had poor response (grade
4,). Using Evans grading system for tumor response, 18
(8.1%) cases had grade I response, 39 (17.5%) grade IIa
response, 124 (55.6%) grade IIb response, 36 (16.1%)
grade III response, and 6 (2.7%) cases had grade IV
response. All the cases with Evans grade III response in this
study showed minimal residual tumor (single cells or small
cluster of cancer cells, <5% viable tumor cells), that was
scored as grade I response by CAP protocol.
Correlation of Histologic Grading of the
Extent of Residual Tumor With Survival
The correlations of histologic grading of the extent of residual tumor after neoadjuvant therapy with DFS and OS
by the CAP and Evans grading systems are shown in Figure 2. None of the 6 patients with pathologic complete
response (pCR) developed recurrence or died from disease
during the follow-up. Patients with pCR had better DFS
and OS than those with viable residual tumors by either
CAP protocol or Evans grading system (P < .05). Patients
with minimal residual tumor (CAP grade I or Evans grade
III) had better OS than those with CAP grades 2 and 3, or
Evans grades IIa, IIb, and I (Fig. 2b,d; P < .05). However,
no significant difference in either DFS or OS was
observed between the patients with CAP grade 2 and
grade 3 (Fig. 2a,b; P > .05). Similarly, there were also no
significant differences in either DFS or OS among the
patients with Evans grades I, IIa, and IIb (Fig. 2c,d).
Because only 6 cases showed pCR in our study and
as there was no statistical difference in either DFS or OS
between the CAP grade 2 response and those with CAP

more viable residual tumor. The clinicopathologic correlations of the grading of the extent of residual tumor are
shown in Table 1. Response group 1 patients had smaller
tumor size, lower posttherapy tumor and AJCC stages,
and lower incidence of lymph node metastasis and positive resection margin than response group 2 patients
(Table 1). None of 42 (0%) response group 1 patients had
positive resection margin compared to 24 of 181 (13%)
response group 2 patients (P ¼ .01). Twenty-three of 42
(55%) response group 1 patients had local recurrence
and/or distant metastasis, which was lower than 73%
(132 of 181 patients) in response group 2 patients (P ¼
.03). No statistical difference in the sites of recurrence
and/or metastasis between these 2 response groups was
observed (Table 1 footnote). There was also no significant
difference in age, sex, tumor differentiation between
response group 1 and 2 (P > .05).
Response group 1 patients had better DFS and OS
than response group 2 patients (Fig. 3a, b). The mean
DFS and OS were 55.8 and 79.2 months in response
group 1 patients compared to 36.8 months (P ¼ .01)
and 48.2 months (P ¼ .0002) in response group 2
patients, respectively. The results from univariate Cox
regression analysis for DFS and OS are shown in Table
2. Both DFS and OS were significantly associated with
ypT, lymph node status, AJCC stage, and histologic
grading of the extent of residual tumor. In addition,

Cancer

June 15, 2012

DFS was also associated with tumor size (P ¼ .04) and
OS was associated with margin status (P ¼ .005) and
blood loss (P ¼ .046). There was no significant correlation of either DFS or OS with sex, tumor differentiation or among the patients who received different
neoadjuvant therapies. Two multivariate analysis models
were used to determine the prognostic significance of
histologic grading of residual tumor for DFS and OS
and the results are shown in Table 3. Histologic grading
of the extent of residual tumor was an independent
prognostic factor for OS in both models. The correlation of histologic grading of the extent of residual
tumor with DFS was not significant in multivariate
analysis. In addition, our data showed that ypT, lymph
node status, and AJCC stages were also independent
prognostic factors for both OS and DFS (Table 3).
Tumor size, blood loss, and margin status was not significant for either DFS or OS in the multivariate analysis.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we used 2 histologic grading systems to evaluate the extent of residual tumor in 223 patients who
received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and subsequently underwent PD. We found that patients with pCR
and minimal residual tumor (response group 1) had better
survivals than those with moderate and poor response
(response group 2). Response group 1 patients had lower

posttherapy tumor and AJCC stages, less frequent lymph
node metastasis, lower rate of positive resection margin,
and lower rate of recurrence and/or metastasis than
response group 2 patients. Histologic grading of the
extent of residual tumor is an independent prognostic factor for OS in this group of patients. Thus, histologic grading of the extent of residual tumor in PD specimen was
important in predicting the prognosis in patients with
PDAC who receive neoadjuvant therapies.
The Evans grading system of the extent of residual
tumor in posttreatment PD is the most widely used in
various clinical studies and clinical trials.5 In this study,

3188

we used Evans grading system to evaluate the percentage
of residual tumor and the CAP protocol to evaluate the ratio between residual tumor cells and the stroma in a large
cohort of 223 posttherapy PD specimens. We found only
6 patients (2.7%) who had pCR (no residual tumor) in
posttreatment PD specimens (Evans grade IV, CAP grade
0). All 6 patients with pCR had confirmed pretreatment
cytologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and a pancreatic
mass by pretreatment CT scan. None of these patients
had recurrence or died of PDAC with a follow-up ranging
from 6.0 to 106 months (median, 70.1 months). Patients
with pCR had better DFS and OS than patients with

residual tumor in their posttreatment PD specimens. Our
study also showed that patients with minimal residual
tumor (<5% residual tumor cells, CAP grade 1) had better OS than those with CAP grade 2 or grade 3 residual
tumor. This finding was consistent with results reported
by Moutardier et al which showed major pathologic
response in 9 of 40 patients, including 3 with pCR, and
better survival in patients with major pathologic response
than those without major response.11 In our study, we did
not observe significant difference in either DFS or OS
among the patients who had the Evans grade I, grade IIb
or IIa residual tumor, in contrast to the study by White
et al that patients who had large residual tumor load (Evans
grade I) in the posttreatment pancreatectomy specimens

had shorter survival than those with no tumor or moderate
residual tumor load.6 Similar results were obtained using
the CAP grading system, and we did not observe significant
differences in either DFS or OS between the groups of
patients with CAP grade 2 and grade 3 residual tumor.
Based on our findings, we propose to modify the current
CAP grading system into a 3-tier grading system for the
extent of residual tumor: Grade 0, no residual carcinoma;
Grade 1, patients with minimal residual carcinoma (single
cells or small groups of cancer cells, <5% residual
carcinoma); and Grade 3, patients with 5% or more
residual carcinoma. This modified grading system is simple
and easy to apply by the pathologists, thus may produce
more consistent and reproducible histologic grading for

the extent of residual tumor in posttreatment pancreatectomy specimens for future studies.
Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is increasingly
used as an alternative to ‘‘surgery-first’’ approach in treatment of patients with potentially resectable PDAC.8,9 For
patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and PD, studies on the prognostic factors are limited.
In our previous study, we found that posttherapy tumor
stage (ypT), lymph node metastasis and AJCC stage are independent prognostic factors for survival in patient with
PDAC who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and
PD.12 Histologic grading of the extent of residual carcinoma
in posttherapy resection specimens has been shown to correlate with the prognosis in patients with carcinoma of several
organ sites, including breast, rectum, esophagus, and gastroesophageal junction region.13-20 Consistent with these finding, we found that histologic grading of the extent of
residual tumor in posttreatment PD correlated significantly
with both DFS and OS in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy by univariate analysis and is an independent
prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis. In addition, we found that patients with pCR and minimal residual
tumor (response group 1) had lower posttherapy tumor and
AJCC stages, less frequent lymph node metastasis, lower rate
of positive resection margin, and lower rate of recurrence
and/or metastasis than response group 2 patients. However,
no significant difference in the sites of recurrence was
observed between these 2 groups of patients in our study.
In summary, we showed that pCR or minimal residual tumor (<5% residual tumor) in posttreatment PD
specimens is associated with better DFS and OS than those
patients with moderate or poor response (5% residual tumor cells) and is an independent prognostic factor for OS in
patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Because no difference was present in either
DFS or OS between the group of patients with CAP grade
2 and those with CAP grade 3 residual tumor in our study,
we propose that the current CAP grading protocol for the
extent of residual tumor should be modified. Histologic
grading of the extent of residual tumor is an important
prognostic factor for patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and pancreatectomy.
