ABSTRACT
Galeterone (Gal) is a first-in-class multi-target oral small molecule that will soon
enter pivotal phase III clinical trials in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
patients. Gal disrupts androgen receptor (AR) signaling via inhibition of CYP17, AR
antagonism and AR degradation. Resistance to current therapy is attributed to upregulation of full-length AR (fAR), splice variants AR (AR-Vs) and AR mutations. The
effects of gal and VNPT55 were analyzed on f-AR and AR-Vs (AR-V7/ARv567es) in LNCaP,
CWR22Rv1 and DU145 (transfected with AR-Vs) human PC cells in vitro and CRPC tumor
xenografts. Galeterone/VNPT55 decreased fAR/AR-V7 mRNA levels and implicates
Mdm2/CHIP enhanced ubiquitination of posttranslational modified receptors, targeting
them for proteasomal degradation. Gal and VNPT55 also induced significant apoptosis in
PC cells via increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio, cytochrome-c release with concomitant cleavage
of caspase 3 and PARP. More importantly, gal and VNPT55 exhibited strong in vivo antiCRPC activities, with no apparent host toxicities. This study demonstrate that gal and
VNPT55 utilize cell-based mechanisms to deplete both fAR and AR-Vs. Importantly,
the preclinical activity profiles, including profound apoptotic induction and inhibition
of CRPC xenografts suggest that these agents offer considerable promise as new
therapeutics for patients with CRPC and those resistant to current therapy.

still presents a great clinical challenge due to inevitable
development of drug resistance [5–10].
Resistance to current therapy has implicated ligand
independent signaling and gene amplification of AR,
mutations causing promiscuity [11] and emergence of
splice variants of the AR that lacks the C-terminal domain
(AR-Vs) [12]. Indeed, the lack of ligand binding domain
(LBD) in AR-Vs is a potential cause of resistance to
drugs that target AR via LBD [6–10, 13, 14]. The wellcharacterized AR-V7 (a.k.a., AR3) reportedly increases
transcription of AR target genes in PC cells [13, 15–18].
It has been suggested that drugs that target the
N-terminal domain (NTD) or regions other than the

INTRODUCTION
The recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) with
metastases following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
is a major concern since it is the primary cause of death
in patients initially diagnosed with localized PC [1–3].
This more aggressive stage of the disease is referred to
as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Since
2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has approved five new agents, including, docetaxel plus
prednisone, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, sipuleucel-T
and enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with CRPC
[4, 5]. Despite these current therapeutic options, CRPC

LBD of AR should be more potent in antagonizing both
fAR and AR-Vs signaling [19]. However, we envision
that agents that cause depletion of both fAR and AR-Vs
(i.e., androgen receptor degrading agents, ARDAs) are
most likely to have a major impact on hormone-sensitive
prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC therapy [20, 21].
In our effort to discover potent and specific inhibitors
of 17α-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase (CYP17), the key enzyme
which catalyzes the biosynthesis of androgens from
progestins,
3β-(hydroxy)-17-(1H-benzimidazole-1-yl)
androsta-5, 16-diene (galeterone or TOK-001, formerly
called VN/124-1) was identified as a selective development
candidate which modulates the androgen receptor (AR)
signaling pathway at multiple points (reviewed in [20]).
Using several in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer
models, we have established that galeterone (gal) inhibits
CYP17, antagonizes fAR, and degrades both fAR and
AR-Vs in vitro; and also reduces the expression of these
proteins in tumor xenografts [22–30]. We also showed that
gal inhibits AR positive and negative prostate cancer cells
suggesting involvement of additional targets [22].
Two other groups have reported independent
in vitro studies on the effects of gal in a variety of
human prostate cancer cell lines. The report by Stein
and colleagues concluded that gal and abiraterone
down-regulated AR signaling via identical multiple
mechanisms [31], while that by Balk and colleagues
reported that gal prevents AR binding to chromatin and
enhances degradation of mutant AR [32]. They even
suggested that gal will function similar to enzalutamide
in CRPC [32]. Some of the results in these two studies
are in contrast to our many studies with gal in several in
vitro models and recapitulated in vivo and in the clinic
(reviewed in [20]; vide infra).
In recent studies, Tokai reported that gal suppressed
castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate
cancer growth in vitro and also blocked nuclear
translocation and decreased AR dependent genes (PSA,
TMPRSS2, and Nkx3.1) [33]. Furthermore, recent clinical
data show that administration of gal to four distinct
CRPC patient populations, including treatment-naïve,
non-metastatic; treatment-naïve, metastatic, abirateronerefractory and enzalutamide-refractory patients resulted in
clinically meaningful PSA reductions and an acceptable
safety profile [34, 35]. Additionally, following a recent
report by our group that gal also strongly degrades ARV7 [21], Tokai conducted a retrospective study of their
phase 2 clinical data and reported positive clinical data
in patients with AR C-terminal loss, showing PSA50
response in 6 of 7 (85.7% response) CRPC patients with
AR C-terminal loss, suggesting that gal has activity in
AR-Vs-expressing CRPC patients [34, 35]. This data is in
contrast to a recent study where no AR-V7-positive patient
had any appreciable clinical benefit from enzalutamide or
abiraterone therapy [6], which clearly differentiates gal
from these related aforementioned androgen/AR targeting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drugs. Gal is scheduled to enter pivotal phase III clinical
trials in the 2nd quarter of 2015 in CRPC patients positive
for AR-V7 [20].
Understanding the multiple effects and pathways
affected by investigational agents in modulating AR is
essential in enhancing the design and synthesis of more
potent and efficacious potential new drug agents [20, 21].
In addition, this new knowledge would enable rational use
and possible combinations with other clinically approved
drugs.
We report for the first time that posttranslational
modulation of fAR and AR-V7 by gal and its 3β-carbamate
analog, VNPT55 in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 involves
enhanced ubiquitination of these receptors. Our results
implicate E3 ligases, Mdm2 and CHIP (C-terminus of
Hsp70-interacting protein) in gal-induced AR/AR-V7
degradation. Interestingly ARv567es, which enhances fAR
transcriptional activity [13, 36, 37] in metastatic CRPC
is also degraded by gal and VNPT55. We also show for
the first time that gal and its analog induce profound
apoptosis in HSPC and CRPC cell lines. Importantly, gal
and VNPT55 show robust anti-tumor efficacy in CRPC
xenografts with significant depletion of AR/AR-V7 and a
high Bax/Bcl2 ratio in vivo, with no apparent host toxicity.
This study also highlights the effects or lack thereof of gal
on non-target nuclear receptors and AR in normal prostate
cells. To our knowledge, gal is currently the only known
agent in clinical trials for prostate cancer that targets
and depletes both the fAR and AR-Vs protein levels. A
preliminary account of part of this work has recently been
reported [38].

RESULTS
Effects of gal and VNPT55 on full length AR and
splice variant AR-Vs
Recent efforts in our lab are focused on designing
and synthesizing more potent analogs of gal (Supplemen­
tary Figure 1A) to target and deplete fAR/AR-V7 and
inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells [21]. Our
initial attempt to compare gal and its new lead analog
was determined using cell viability assays in LNCaP
and CWR22Rv1 cells. VNPT55 exhibited stronger
growth inhibitory activity (GI50 = 0.87 and 2.45 μM vs.
LNCaP and CWR22Rv1, respectively) compared to gal
(GI50 = 3.35 and 4.46 μM vs. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1,
respectively).
Based on the recent report that gal decreases fAR
mRNA in LNCaP cells [31], we compared the effects of
gal and VNPT55 on fAR/AR-V7 mRNA levels. Both gal
and VNPT55 decreased fAR mRNA levels in LNCaP
cells (Figure 1A, left panel). Interestingly, although gal
had no effect on AR-V7 mRNA, VNPT55 significantly
decreased AR-V7 mRNA even at 1 μmol/L (Figure 1A,
right panel) in CWR22Rv1 cells. It is interesting that

minor modification to the parent compound increases the
analog’s potency and efficacy in modulating fAR/AR-V7
at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels. To
establish and compare the efficacies of gal/VNPPT55 on
AR-Vs, we analyzed the potency of gal and VNPT55 in
depleting protein levels of fAR/AR-V7 in CWR22Rv1
cells (Figure 1B, left panel). In agreement with our earlier
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

report [21], the efficacy of VNPT55 on cell viability and
AR-induced depletion appears to be superior to that of gal.
It is well documented that CWR22Rv1 cells
express a number of AR-Vs [16, 39]. Thus, to eliminate
the possibility of AR-V7 antibody cross-reacting with
other AR-Vs and to specifically determine its effects on
particular AR-Vs, DU145 cells were transfected with

AR-V7 expression plasmid and treated with gal or
VNPT55. At concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, each
compound significantly depleted AR-V7 (Figure 1B,
right panel). Transfection of ARv567es (AR splice variant
expressed in CRPC, [13]) and subsequent treatment with
gal/VNPT55 yielded similar results (Figure 1C, left panel).
Densitometry analysis of the efficacy of gal and VNPT55
on AR/AR-V7 protein levels shows a strong decrease
of AR/AR-V7 to 0.4/0.3 after gal treatment and a more
profound decrease after VNPT55 treatment to 0.3/0.09 of
AR/AR-V7, respectively (Figure 1C, right panel).
The proteasomal pathway has been described as one
of the major mechanisms regulating AR turnover [40–43].
To determine the involvement of the 26S proteasome
in gal- or VNPT55-enhanced depletion of AR/AR-V7
protein, we co-treated cells with gal or VNPT55 and a
proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1
cells. As shown in Figure 1D, E and 1F, proteasomal
inhibition significantly rescued gal- and VNPT55 induced
fAR/AR-V7 degradation in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1
cells. Our previously published report implicated
intracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) release and induction
of endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) in PC-3
PC cells as a possible mechanism of action of gal [22].
Because other studies have established Ca2+-dependent,
calpain-mediated breakdown of f-AR in human PC cells
[44–47], we consider it important to determine whether
gal’s depletion of AR may implicate calpains. Indeed,
although inhibition of calpains with calpeptin (Cal) did
not entirely rescue gal/VNPT55-induced AR degradation
(Supplementary Figure 1B, C and D), it indicates to a
minor extent (~20%), that the possible release of Ca2+
induced by gal treatment enhanced AR depletion.
Since ubiquitination precedes 26S proteasomal
protein degradation [48], we examined whether gal
enhanced AR and AR-V7 ubiquitination. Gal treatment
in the presence of MG132 significantly increased AR
ubiquitination compared to MG132 alone (Figure 1G, left
panel) in LNCaP cells. In CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 1G,
right panel), immunoprecipitated AR-V7 in the presence
of gal and MG132 interestingly also shows an increase in
AR-V7 ubiquitination.

Ser166 also increased significantly. It is important to
note that, although phosphorylated levels of AR seems
to decrease (see band intensities), the relative levels of
phosphorylated AR to total AR show an increase in AR
phosphorylation, both in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells
(Figure 2C, densitometry). Total AR levels decrease
due to depletion effects of gal and VNPT55, so in order
to quantify phosphorylated AR levels we calculated the
p-AR/AR ratio (Figure 2C).
We then investigated the significance of Akt/Mdm2
phosphorylation in gal/VNPT55-induced AR/AR-V7
depletion. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3k (LY294002,
20 μM) in LNCaP cells co-treating with gal/VNPT55
suppressed agent-induced AR degradation significantly
(~90%) (Figure 2D and 2E). In CWR22Rv1 (Figure
2F) cells, we observed that rescue of gal-induced fAR
degradation was similar to the trend in LNCaP cells in
Figure 2D. In contrast, AR-V7 depletion was not rescued,
but was further depleted compared to gal alone treatment.
It is well-established that the lack of LBD and thus loss of
N-C interaction changes AR-V7 dynamics and interacting
proteins [50, 51]. It is reasonable to suggest that this
phenomenon may contribute to the effects seen when gal
is combined with LY294002.
The PI3k-Akt and the mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways both crosstalk with the AR
and induce its phosphorylation at different serine and
threonine residues [40, 52, 53]. To rule out any possible
involvement of MAPK pathway in gal/VNPT55-induced
AR/AR-V7 modulation, U0126 (20 μmol/L), a MAPK
inhibitor, was co-incubated with gal in both LNCaP and
CWR22Rv1 cells. As shown in Figure 2D, E and 2F, the
ability of gal to degrade fAR and AR-V7 were not blocked
in the presence of U0126.
It has been reported that both LY294002 and
UO126 exhibits off-target effects and decreases AR
protein expression [54–57]. In agreement with previous
reports, we observed that U0126 cause suppression of AR
(Supplementary Figure 2A). In addition, we show that
U0126 decreased AR-V7 expression in CWR22Rv1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2B). In contrast to the effects of
LY294002 or U0126 on fAR degradation, the combination
of these inhibitors with gal cause enhanced AR-V7
degradation (Figure 2F). It is possible that the loss in N-C
interaction in AR-V7 and as a consequence, the loss in
c-terminal phosphorylation sites needed to enhance ARV7 stabilization and/or possible off-target effects of the
inhibitors may be potentiated by gal. Collective, these data
suggest that unlike MAPK kinase, PI3k/Akt kinase plays a
significant role in gal-induced fAR degradation.

Implication of Akt and Mdm2 phosphorylations
in gal/VNPT55-induced AR degradation
PI3k activation induces phosphorylation of
Akt (at Ser473 and Thr308), Mdm2 (at Ser166) and
AR (at  Ser210/213 and Ser790) this posttranslational
modification can serve as a signal for AR ubiquitylation
and subsequent degradation [40, 42, 43, 49]. We next
examined the effects of gal and VNPT55 on Akt and
Mdm2 phosphorylations. As shown in Figure 2A and
2B, treatment of LNCaP or CWR22Rv1 cells with gal
or VNPT55, resulted in increased phosphorylations of
Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Mdm2 phosphorylation at

degradation [51, 58, 59]. To determine their involvement
in gal-induced fAR/ARV7 degradation, Mdm2 or CHIP
were silenced using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in
LNCaP or CWR22Rv1 cells followed by treatments with
gal for 24 h. As shown in Figure 3A, although both Mdm2
and CHIP knockdown inhibited fAR degradation, the
effect was more significant with Mdm2 knockdown in
LNCaP cells. Conversely, in CWR22Rv1 cells, silencing
of CHIP E3 ligase exhibited a higher rescue effect on
gal-induced degradation of AR-V7 (Figure 3B). We

also knockdown Mdm2 or CHIP and in the absence of
gal, there was no significant effect on fAR or AR-V7
(Supplementary Figure 2C and D).
Mdm2 has previously been reported to interact and
enhance AR ubiquitination preceding its degradation via
the 26S proteasome [43]. From our siRNA knockdown
experiments (Figure 3A), we hypothesized that gal
enhanced AR-Mdm2 and AR-V7-CHIP interactions,
thereby increasing the receptors’ ubiquitination and
subsequent degradation. To ensure immunoprecipitating

equal amount of proteins, specifically fAR/AR-V7, in
both control and treated groups, cells were treated for
either 11 or 14 h with gal at 10 μM and total cell lysates
analyzed prior to immunoprecipitation experiments
(Supplementary Figure 2E and F). Input lanes are from
control (DMSO) treated cell lysates to confirm molecular
weights of immunoprecipitated proteins. Treatments
with gal greatly enhanced fAR-Mdm2 interaction in both
LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 3C). Heat shock
protein 90 (Hsp90) is known to interact with AR in a
heteromeric complex which enhances stability of the nonligand bound receptor [40, 42, 51, 60]. Hsp90 inhibitors
such as 17-AAG induce AR-Hsp90 dissociation and
enhance AR degradation [61]. We determined the effects
of gal on Hsp90-fAR interaction. Interestingly, we found
that in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, gal treatment
significantly reduced this interaction (Figure 3D).
Results from immunoprecipitation assays were
consistent with our siRNA experiments, in that the CHIP
E3 ligase is more significant in gal-induced AR-V7
ubiquitylation and degradation. Gal enhanced association
between CHIP and AR-V7 (Figure 3E, left panel). A recent
report on the possibility of Hsp70-AR-V7 interaction
[60], prompted us to investigate the effects of gal on this
interaction if any. Indeed, we found that gal enhanced Hsp70AR-V7 interaction (Figure 3E, right panel), suggesting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Hsp70 involvement in the formation of a degradation
complex. The Co-IP with AR confirmed increased
interactions in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, respectively,
between fAR and Mdm2 and a loss in interaction between
fAR and Hsp90 (Figure 3F, left and middle panels). As
shown in Figure 3F right panel, we immunoprecipitated
AR-V7 from CWR22Rv1 cell lysates and observed an
increase in interacting proteins CHIP and Hsp70. These data
suggest that, changes observed in Hsp90-AR and Hsp70AR-V7 interactions after gal treatment possibly rendered
the receptors more susceptible to proteasomal degradation,
in agreement with documented reports of small moleculeinduced fAR degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasomemediated proteolysis pathway [40, 42, 51, 60].
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that
gal/VNPT55-induced fAR/AR-V7 protein degradation is
mediated predominantly through the ubiquitin/proteasome
pathway that involves Mdm2 and CHIP E3 ligases.

Furthermore, we also assessed gal/VNPT55
apoptotic induction by flow cytometry. CWR22Rv1 cells
treated for 24 h with gal and VNPT55 (5 and 10 μM) were
stained with annexin-v and propidium iodide, following

analysis on PARP cleavage, a well-established signature of
apoptosis [65], shows a dose-dependent effect on activated
caspase 3 and cleaved PARP in both LNCaP (Figure 4B,
left panel) and CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 4B, right panel).
As stated earlier, we previously reported that gal
modulates intracellular Ca2+ levels and endoplasmic
reticulum stress response (ERSR) [22]. Intracellular Ca2+
have previously been implicated in the modulation of
calpains that also induce apoptosis by cleaving a variety of
pro-apoptotic proteins such as calpain 1 which cleaves Bid

to enhance cytochrome c release [66]. Thus, we directed our
efforts to determine whether gal-induced apoptosis was as a
result of activated calpains, and/or solely due to other wellestablished pathways. Initial attempts with time-dependent
analysis of gal on PARP cleavage showed this to coincide
with calpain activation at 12 hours post gal treatment
(Figure 4C). To assess whether gal/VNPT55-induced PARP
cleavage is a consequence of caspase activation via other
mechanisms or due to calpain activation, LNCaP cells were
treated with gal in the presence or absence of the caspase
inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, or the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin.
Data presented in Figure 4D and 4E shows that both gal
and VNPT55-induced PARP cleavage was predominantly
not via calpain activation.
Since calpain inhibition did not significantly inhibit
caspase 3 and PARP cleavage, we focused on Bax, a
proapoptotic protein which could enhance mitochondrial
permeability [63, 67, 68]. LNCaP cells treated with
increasing doses of gal resulted in significant and remarkable
enhancement of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax and a modest
decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl2 (Figure 4F), leading to
profound increase of the Bax/Bcl2 ratio (Figure 4G).
An increase in Bax and its translocation to the
mitochondria has been implicated in cytochrome c
release into the cytosol [69–71], and it has also been
shown that Bax co-localization with mitochondria
results in Bax protein pore formation to enhance the
release of mitochondrial intermembrane protein [69,
72, 73]. We therefore stained for Bax-mitochondria colocalization in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells after
24 h treatments with gal or VNPT55. As shown in Figure
4H gal/VNPT55 treatments cause Bax co-localization
with mitochondria (yellow stains). To show cytochrome c
release as a result of Bax translocation and pore formation
in the mitochondria, we stained CWR22Rv1 cells with
mitotracker and cytochrome c after a 24 h gal/VNPT55
treatment. As illustrated in Figure 4I, we see a significant
release of cytochrome c, as indicated by co-localization
of cytochrome c (green) and mitotracker (red) in control
(DMSO) contrary to treated cells.
In summary, gal and VNPT55 induce profound
apoptosis in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. Importantly,
these promising and robust data differ from previous
reports which suggest that current PC drugs that block AR
transactivation do not cause significant apoptosis, which
is believed, in part, to be the basis of their failure in the
clinic [19].

receptor (PR), estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) and retinoic
acid receptors (RAR-α and -β), which are known to be
regulated by the proteasome-mediated pathway [74].
As shown in Figure 5A, whereas gal/VNPT55 caused
profound depletion of AR, no change in PR, RARα and
RARβ protein levels were detected. In addition, and as
expected, there was a modest up-regulation of ERβ (a PC
tumor suppressor) [75], as a consequence of AR depletion
[76]. Interestingly, gal had no significant effect on AR
expression in immortalized untransformed PWR-1E
(epithelial) prostate cells (Figure 5B). These data suggest
that gal and VNPT55 exhibit cell selective induction of
AR degradation.

Galeterone and VNPT55 suppress CWR22Rv1
xenograft tumor growth and AR/AR-V7 in
castrated SCID mice
Gal is currently in clinical development for the
treatment of CRPC. Because splice variant AR-V7 plays
a significant role in castration resistance, we further
evaluated the efficacy of gal and VNPT55 in CRPC
AR-V7 positive CWR22Rv1 xenografts. Cells inoculated
on flanks of mice after castration grew into sizeable
tumors even with complete ADT (Figure 6A). Castrated
male SCID mice bearing CWR22Rv1 tumors were treated
with vehicle, gal or VNPT55 for 34 days as described
in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 6A,
gal and VNPT55 significantly inhibited CWR22Rv1
tumor growth by 60% (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle) and 70%
(p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle), respectively. In addition, no host
toxicity was observed as monitored by changes in body
weight throughout the study (Figure 6B). The H & E
staining of liver, lung and kidney in the treated groups did
not show any gross organ abnormalities on histological
examinations (Figure 6C).
To further validate the anti-prostate cancer activities
of gal and VNPT55 seen in vitro; we evaluated the
expression levels of f-AR, AR-V7 and cell cycle and
apoptosis-related proteins in vivo using representative tumor
samples. Immunohistochemistry analysis with anti-fAR and
AR-V7 antibody on tumors showed that gal and VNPT55,
significantly reduced intensities and expressions of fAR
and AR-V7 in treated samples (Figure 6D) In addition, a
significant decrease in the expression of proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) was observed in gal and VNPT55
treated tumors, suggesting the inhibitory effects on cell
cycle in vivo (Figure 6D). Immunohistochemical stain
quantification of Figure 6D shows the significant decrease
in protein expression in vivo (Figure 6E). Western blot
analysis further confirmed that gal and VNPT55 degrade
both fAR and AR-V7 in the tumors. As shown in Figure
6F, both agents caused significant depletion of cyclin D1
and Bcl2 and an increase in Bax expression. Densitometry

together, these data show that gal and VNPT55 suppress the

related to its multiple effects. Additional inhibitory effects
of gal on AR binding to chromatin were reported by Balk
and colleagues [45]. Overexpression of fAR and AR-Vs
is implicated in resistance to current approved therapy in
HSPC and CRPC [11, 12]. Through the use of clinically
relevant PC cell lines and pharmacologic inhibitors, we
demonstrated that fAR and AR-V7 protein degradation
by these two novel agents involves predominantly, the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The potential roles of
Mdm2 and CHIP E3 ligases in gal-induced degradation of
fAR and AR-V7, respectively, are summarized in a model
in Figure 7.

Androgen receptor pathway antagonism is one of the
major strategies in prostate cancer therapy. Currently gal’s
efficacy against HSPC and CRPC cancer cells is strongly

Interestingly, the fact that fAR and AR-V7 mRNA
levels and their protein levels following treatment of PC
cells with gal or VNPT55 were significantly depleted, as
well as ARv567es protein levels, suggest that these agents
could deplete a wide range of AR mutants or variants that
are expressed in CRPC. AR is known to auto-regulate
its transcription [76], and a decline of AR protein would
be expected to cause an increase in AR transcription.
However, the fact that we observe a decrease in AR mRNA
and protein depletion suggests that gal and its analog could
sustain a down-regulation of AR in PC patients. It is also
important to note that resistance and proliferation abilities
of PC cells due to activated pathways by non-genotropic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activities of AR [78] will be eliminated resulting in an
enhanced anti-cancer activity.
Further mechanistic analysis revealed that pharma­
cological inhibition of Akt phosphorylation suppressed
gal-induced fAR degradation in contrast to the effects
seen with AR-V7 degradation. Single agent treatment
with LY294002 did not significantly affect AR-V7 protein
expression (Supplementary Figure 2B), however the
combination decreased its expression further, and this
was the case with MAPK inhibitor also, which leads a
potential future combination treatment studies to target
AR-V7. From our data, Akt and Mdm2 phosphorylation
was significantly implicated in fAR degradation in both

Figure 7: Schematic representation for proposed mechanisms of Gal on full length AR and splice variant AR-V7
degradation. 1) Major pathway for gal-induced fAR degradation (left). Gal treatment of PC cells implicates PI3K/Akt pathway: Akt
phosphorylates AR at Ser210. Active Akt also phosphorylates Mdm2, which enhances ubiquitination of AR. Ubiquitinated AR is degraded
by the 26S proteasome. 2) Major pathway for gal-induced AR-V7 degradation (right). Gal treatment of PC cells stimulates increased
interaction between CHIP-AR-V7, which then enhances ubiquitination of AR-V7 and targets it to degradation via the 26S proteasome.

LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. Using targeted siRNA
knockdown of Mdm2/CHIP and immunoprecipitation
assays we demonstrated that, unlike fAR, gal induction
of AR-V7 degradation significantly involved enhanced
interaction with CHIP E3 ligase. The lack of C-terminal
domain of the splice variant AR-V7 has been reported
to change its dynamics and cofactors impacting proteinprotein interactions [79]. It is possible that this truncation
also changes protein-protein interactions induced by gal on
the variant AR to favor CHIP E3 ligase mediated AR-V7
degradation. Further studies on AR-V7-CHIP interaction
are needed to fully delineate the significant factors
involved in AR-V7 modulation. A recent report suggests
that AR phosphorylation impairments may favor CHIP E3
ligase-mediated fAR proteasomal degradation [80]. This
may be the case with gal-induced AR-V7 degradation.
Gal induced dissociation of fAR from Hsp90
after treatment in LNCaP cells. Although there is sparse
literature on AR-Vs and their interactions with coactivators/chaperones, Weigel and colleagues recently
reported that unlike fAR, AR-V7 is resistant to inhibitors
of the Hsp90-AR heterocomplex and suggested possible
existence of Hsp70-AR-V7 complex [60]. Our data
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

appear to be consistent with this report, because ARV7 degradation was preceded by Hsp70 and CHIP
association. Perhaps, what’s more interesting is that,
although AR-Hsp90 disruptive inhibitors have no effect
on AR-V7, we show that AR-V7 undergoes ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation and hence can be targeted
via that pathway.
In addition to gal’s well-established triple mecha­
nism of anti-AR activity [21, 30], we report for the first
time that gal-induces robust apoptosis in PC cells in vitro
and in vivo. Induction of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage is
possibly one of the major reasons for the efficacy of gal
and its analog in inhibiting PC cell growth. We note that
the apoptosis-inducing effect of an agent is also dependent
on the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins
(Bcl2 and Bax) [81]. Typically, the ratio of Bcl2 and Bax
protein expression is used as an index of apoptosis [82].
We observed a remarkable up-regulation of Bax protein
levels and a moderate decrease in the Bcl-2 protein
levels, leading to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. This
observation is important, as induction of robust apoptosis
is crucial for inhibition of growth and progression of PC,
and may be considered as a paramount predictive marker
27454

MATERIALS AND METHODS

for forecasting the clinical therapeutic response to gal
and its analogs. Depletion of Bcl2 may also contribute
significantly to the anti-cancer efficacy of gal, as Bcl2 is
known to cause chemo-resistance in prostate cancer [83].
To confirm that most of these effects seen on the
various pathways were not as a result of increased utilized
doses, we compared induction of apoptosis at different
doses (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μmol/L) over 24 and 72 h,
using different complementary analytical tools. We also
evaluated the effects on AR/AR-V7 at low concentrations
with positive results (Supplementary Figure 1E and F).
This suggests that the effects of gal and VNPT55 (at
concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μmol/L) on fAR/ARV7 and apoptosis are not off target or toxic effects. The
fact that gal and VNPT55 also induce calpain-dependent
AR depletion led us to conclude that gal and VNPT55
induce well-established cell based mechanisms to inhibit
cell proliferation.
Remarkably, gal and VNPT55 had no significant
effect on the expression of fAR in immortalized
untransformed prostate epithelial cells (PWR-1E). This
is very significant as it gives an insight to the low toxic
nature of the agent, as observed in the clinic [20, 34, 35],
and the potential of a minimal effect on AR expressed in
healthy non-cancerous tissues. This finding is consistent
with the ability of agents to preferentially induce depletion
of AR expression in PC tumors, without affecting AR
expression in normal prostate cells, as recently reported
by others [49, 84].
Perhaps the most significant piece of data from this
study is the anti-tumor efficacy of gal and VNPT55 in
fAR/AR-V7 positive CWR22Rv1 xenografts (a difficultto-treat CRPC model). Gal/VNPT55 significantly inhibited
tumor growth compared to vehicle treated groups, with
no apparent host toxicity. Gal and VNPT55 also degraded
both fAR, AR-V7 in vivo and also depleted cyclin D1 and
Bcl2, but enhanced the level of Bax. In strong support of
their mechanisms of anti-tumor activities, most effects
seen in vitro were recapitulated in vivo.
One major mechanism of resistance in CRPC is
the overexpression of AR and the emergence of splice
variant ARs (AR-Vs). Recently approved PC drugs, i.e.,
abiraterone and enzalutamide have been reported to cause
rapid induction and increased expression of AR-Vs in
laboratory and clinical settings [6–10, 13, 14]. In addition,
anti-androgens currently used for the treatment of PC
do not cause significant apoptosis that may contribute to
their failures in the clinic [19]. The present study shows
significant gal-induced degradation of fAR, AR-V7 and
ARv567es that are implicated in all stages of PC progression
and resistance settings [6–10, 13, 14]. Our in vivo CRPC
xenograft data validated the effects observed in vitro.
Overall, this study has high translational relevance
because it provides strong preclinical validation of phase
II results and the proposed pivotal phase III clinical trials
of gal in PC patients with AR-Vs.

microscope.

Plasmid and siRNA transfections
DU145 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of AR-V7
or ARv567es expression plasmid, using the Qiagen Effectene
transfection reagent following manufacturers’ protocol.
Transfection reagents and complexes were washed off 16 h
after transfection and replaced with phenol red free media
supplemented with 5% charcoal dextran FBS for 20  h.
Transfected cells were treated with agents for 24 h and
lysed with RIPA buffer. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were

Immunohistochemical analysis
All specimens were kept in 10% buffered formalin
for 24 h after which they were embedded in paraffin and 4
μm thick slides prepared and used for immunostaining and
hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunostaining sections were
de-parafinised, soaked in alcohol, and antigen retrieval was
performed for formalin fixed tissues by heating in citrate
buffer (pH = 6). Sections were blocked in 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 5 minutes, followed by incubation with the
appropriate antibody and epitopes detected using the
Ultra-sensitive ABC staining kit (Thermo fisher scientific,
USA). The images were captured with an EVOS® FL Auto
Imaging System (Life Technologies).

apoptotic detection assay was used to determine apoptotic
cells. Briefly, cells were treated in 6 well plates at 2.5
μM for 72 h. Cells were washed 1X with warm PBS and
incubated in 400 μl of 0.1% EB and 0.2% AO in PBS
at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cells were again washed once

was used following manufacturers protocol.

In vivo xenograft tumor growth
All animal studies were performed according
to the guidelines approved by the Animal Care
Committee of the University Of Maryland, School of
Medicine, Baltimore. Male SCID mice 5–6 weeks
of age were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute (Fredrick, MD). Surgically castrated mice
were housed under complete aseptic conditions,
fed autoclaved pellets and sterile water ad libitum.
Following a week of acclimatization, approximately
5 × 106 CWR22Rv1 cells were inoculated into
both flanks. Tumor-bearing mice (tumor volume
around 50–70 mm3) were randomized into 3 groups
(6 mice in each group; compounds formulated in
vehicle) and treated as follows: (i) vehicle control (40%
β-cyclodextin in ddH2O, i.p.), (ii) galeterone (0.15 mmol/
kg, i.p., twice daily, 5 days/week) and (iii) VNPT55
(0.15 mmol/kg, i.p., twice daily, 5 days/week). Tumors
were measured twice weekly with calipers and tumor
volume was calculated by the formula: length × width2
× 0.5 (mm3). Animals were also weighed weekly and
monitored for general health status and signs of possible
toxicity due to treatments. Mice were sacrificed after the
indicated periods of treatment and tumors and organs
excised. Tumors were divided and either flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen or placed in 10% buffered formalin for
western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry (IHC) and
hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining.

RNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain
reaction analysis
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 0.3 × 106
cells per well and treated with indicated concentrations
of compounds for 24 h. RNA was isolated with the
Qiagen RNeasy reagents following manufacturer’s
protocol. 1800 ng of RNA were reverse transcribed into
cDNA using high capacity cDNA reverse conversion
kit (life technologies). Full length AR primers, AR-V7
and internal control 18S primer sequences used were as
reported in Guo et al [16]. Relative expression levels of
fAR and AR-V7 were quantified with the comparative
ΔΔCt using 18S as internal control.
