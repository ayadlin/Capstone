ABSTRACT
Aberrant expression of miRNAs, cytokines and chemokines are involved in
pathogenesis of colon cancer. However, the expression of p53 mediated miRNAs,
cyto- and chemokines after radiation and SN38 treatment in colon cancer remains
elusive. Here, human colon cancer cells, HCT116 with wild-type, heterozygous and
a functionally null p53, were treated by radiation and SN38. The expression of 384
miRNAs was determined by using the TaqMan® miRNA array, and the expression
of cyto- and chemokines was analyzed by Meso-Scale-Discovery instrument. Upor down-regulations of miRNAs after radiation and SN38 treatments were largely
dependent on p53 status of the cells. Cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, VEGF,
and chemokines, IL-8, MIP-1α were increased, and IFN-γ expression was decreased
after radiation, whereas, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, IL-8 were decreased,
and VEGF and MIP-1α were increased after SN38 treatment. Bioinformatic analysis
pointed out that the highly up-regulated miRNAs, let-7f-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-98,
miR-155-5p and the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p, miR202-5p were associated with colon cancer pathways and correlated with cyto- or
chemokine expression. These miRNAs have the potential for use in colon cancer
therapy as they are related to p53, pro- or anti-inflammatory cyto- or chemokines
after the radiation and SN38 treatment.

of camptothecin acting as a topoisomerase I inhibitor.
SN38 is thought to exert its antitumor activity in vivo
after enzymatic cleavage by carboxylesterases 1 and 2
[3]. Although long-standing efforts on early diagnosis
and efficient treatment have been made to improve patient
survival, but the successes have not been subsequently
confirmed, and the benefits of radio- and chemotherapy are
still under investigation. The identification of molecular
biomarkers and other therapeutic target has been the
focus of extensive research where the ultimate goal is
to discover markers with a diagnostic and/or therapeutic
value. In most cases, it is not clear what causes colon
cancer, although several risk factors have been identified

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are the third most
common type of cancer, with approximately one million
new cases each year world-wide, and the second most
frequent cause of cancer-related death in the United
States and in Europe [1]. Moreover, it is the second
most common site-specific cancer affecting both men
and women. Radio- and chemotherapy are the primary
treatment in both resectable and advanced CRCs.
Radiation improved overall and cancer-specific survival
compared to surgery alone [2]. SN38, an active metabolite
of irinotecan (or CPT-11), is a water-soluble derivative

over the years. Recently, inflammation in the colon has
been implicated in development of colon cancer and its
role has been validated by many excellent epidemiological
and experimental studies [4, 5]. Activated inflammatory
cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive
nitrogen intermediates that can induce DNA damage and
mutation [6]. However, in response to DNA damage, it
is also well established that p53 is an important factor,
whereas, p53-mutant cells are resistant to drug-induced
apoptosis [7]. It has been shown that colon cancer cells are
sensitive to different treatments depending on p53 status
[8]. On the contrary, cyto- and chemokines can serve
as tumor growth and survival factors, and can promote
or reduce tumor growth [9]. Commonly, after a tumor
forms, the localized inflammatory microenvironment
can promote the accumulation of additional mutations
and epigenetic changes. One of the epigenetic regulator,
microRNAs (miRNAs), a small non-coding RNAs of 18–
24 nucleotides regulates gene expression by translational
repression or cleavage of the mRNA targets [10]. miRNAs
are involved in various biological processes including
cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [11].
Expression of many miRNAs is up- or down-regulated in
tumors compared to normal tissues, including CRCs [12].
Further, a large number of evidence suggests that miRNAs
is involved in modulating the chemosensitivity and
chemoresistance of tumor cells [13]. Each miRNA has the
ability to control the activity of hundreds of target genes,
including oncogenes and tumor suppressors, like p53 [14],
although miRNA expression in relation to radiation, SN38,
and increase or decrease of cyto- or chemokine expression
is less investigated.
The present study aimed to investigate the p53 gene
mediated expression of miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines in
human colon cancer cells (HCT116) after the treatments
of radiation and SN38, and further examined the most
significantly up- or down-regulated miRNAs to find out
whether there is any possible interaction between these
miRNAs and increased or decreased cyto- and chemokine
expression in colon cancer cells in response to the radiation
and SN38 treatments. This study is hypothesized to find out
a possible link between the expression of miRNAs, cyto-,
chemokines and p53 gene after the treatment of radiation
and SN38 in colon cancer cells; this might predict miRNAs,
as a therapeutic target in future colon cancer therapy.

of SN38 (0–1 μM) was examined by using the XTT assay.
The IC50 value for HCT116p53+/+ cells was found to be 100
nM, 150 nM for HCT116p53+/- and 300 nM for HCT116p53/cells, respectively. IC50 is the maximal concentration of
SN38 to cause 50% inhibition of biological activity of
the cells. Similarly ID50 is the maximal radiation dose to
cause the half of the inhibition of the cells. Percentage
of inhibition of cells is different for different cell types,
and percentage of inhibition depends on the responses of
the particular cancer cell types to particular radiation and
drug. The IC50 and ID50 dosages were used for all further
experiments.

Expression of miRNAs in HCT116 cells after
radiation and SN38 treatment
Expression levels of 379 miRNAs and 5 control
assays were analyzed in HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53+/- and
HCT116p53-/- after radiation and SN38 treatment. Figure 1
illustrates that the different cell lines had almost the same
trends of raw Ct values. The data were presented as log2
(T/N) values where T was considered as treatment and N
was as untreated. The levels of miRNA expression were
changed by the treatments, and the results depended on
p53 gene status in the different cell lines. Log2 (T/N)
value > 0.5 of miRNA expression was considered as upregulation.
Figure 2 displays an overview of human miRNA
expression after radiation (A) and SN38 (B) treatments in
a euclidean based heatmap, along with a dendrogram, with
the cell lines grouped in vertical columns and miRNAs
arranged horizontally by the similarity of the expression to
one another. We focused our attention on these confidently
detected miRNAs so that the downstream analysis was
based on the most reliable expression data. miRNAs that
were part of the same family showed highly correlated
expression. The HCT116p53+/+ cells had most up-regulated
miRNAs while HCT116p53-/- cells had most down-regulated
ones in the both radiation and SN38 treatments, although
miRNAs were expressed in a much higher level under
radiation treatment compared to SN38 treatment. In the both
treatments, miRNAs were divided into two major groups,
and each of the group was divided into the number of subgroups in a similar fashion depending on their expression
pattern.
To study the p53 gene dependent or independent
expression of miRNAs after the radiation or SN38
treatment in the cells, we used Empirical Bayes method
(EBarrays), and the results are presented in Figure 3A
and 3B and Table 1a–1d1. Irrespective of p53 status, after
radiation miR-302a and miR-302c up-regulated, and miR518f down-regulated in the all cell lines, whereas after
SN38 treatment up-regulated miRNAs were miR-133a,
miR-155-3p, miR-204, miR-22, miR-512-3p, miR-517a,
miR-517c and miR-708 in the all cell lines (Figure 3,
Table 1a).

status in colon cancer cells. To validate our results found
in HCT116 cells, we further examined the expression
of miRNAs, let-7f-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-98, miR-1555p, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p and miR-2025p in KM12C and KM12L4a human colon cancer cell
lines. We used 2Gy radiation and 150 nM SN38 for the
subsequent experiments. The results showed that let-7f-5p,
miR-455-3p, miR-98 and miR-155-5p were up-regulated
in KM12C (Supplementary Figure S1) and KM12L4a
(Supplementary Figure S2) cell lines after radiation and
SN38 treatment, whereas miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-1425p and miR-202-5p were undetected in KM12C and
KM12L4a cell lines after radiation and SN38 treatment.
So, we were interested to further study the pathways
of these miRNAs and to predict their relationships with
KEGG pathways by using DIANA-miRPath tool. Figure
4 indicates their relationships with the pathway of colon
cancer and almost every sub-pathway contains target
genes of the 8 miRNAs. Target genes of the 8 miRNAs
are distributed in all the sub-pathways, especially PI3KAkt signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. K-ras

is the mostly target gene of these miRNAs. These two
pathways along with K-ras pathway have been proven by
previous studies to play key roles in the overall colorectal
cancer pathway. Figure 5 shows the heatmap of these
miRNAs and different pathways by clustering from
pathway union.

reduction of TNF-α was pronounced in HCT116p53+/+ cells
as compared to the other two cell lines. Furthermore, we
observed increased expression of MIP-1α and VEGF in all
the cell lines treated under the similar radiation condition
compared to unradiated cells. Moreover, after 48 hr of
2Gy radiation exposure, significant increase of IL6, IL1β, IL-4, IL-10, VEGF, TNF-α cytokines as well as IL-8
and MIP-1α chemokine expression were noticed in all cell
lines compared to unradiated cells (Figure 6A). Reduced
IL-6 expression was observed after the SN38 treatment in
the all cell lines irrespective with their p53 status. A similar
trend of reduction was noticed in case of IFN-γ, IL-1β,
IL-4, and even in IL-10 expression. Furthermore, TNF- α
expression was seen to be reduced in HCT116p53+/+ and
HCT116p53-/- cells but in HCT116p53+/- cells no noticeable
changes was found when compared with untreated cells
(Figure 6B). Increased MIP-1α and VEGF were observed
after SN38 treatment in HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53+/- but

DISCUSSION
The mechanisms underlying colon cancer
remain subjects of extensive investigation in the cancer
biology field. It is known that colon cancer results from
accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic alterations of
the cellular genome, which transforms normal glandular
epithelium into adenocarcinoma [15]. Increased or
decreased expression of miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines
are associated with development and progression
of various cancers by stimulating the translation of
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Such as, the tumor
suppressor gene p53 is mutated in about 70% of CRCs
and it is an essential step in the development of CRCs
[16]. The mechanism by which p53 is inactivated in the
evolution of cancer can have important consequences
on responsiveness to cancer treatment. For example,
p53 mutation renders HCT116 colon cancer cells more

sensitive to radiation and adriamycin but less sensitive
to 5-fluorouracil [17]. A further complication is that p53
appears to respond to RNA damage rather than DNA
damage in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment [17]. The
interaction of p53, miRNAs and cytokines as prognostic
classifiers and their functional role in the development
of metastases were studied in different types of cancers
including colon cancer [18–22]. Generally, epigenetic
alterations not only complement genetic alterations in
the colon cancer, but also complex interactions between
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

different DNA, alteration of cytokine production and
chromatin modifications exist which characterize
subgroups of colon cancer with distinct etiology and
prognosis. Although, long-standing efforts on early
diagnosis and efficient treatment have been made to
improve patient survival, the successes have not been
subsequently confirmed, and the benefits of radio-, and/
or chemotherapy are still under investigation [23]. In the
present study, we examined the expression of miRNAs
in HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53+/- and HCT116p53-/- cell lines

after radiation and SN38 treatment. Furthermore, we used
Empirical Bayes method (EBarrays) to study differentially
expressed miRNAs between untreated and treated cells
based on their p53 status. Wild type (wt) p53 (+/+) can
induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, which
are sufficient to explain tumor suppression by p53 [24].
Irrespective of wild type or mutated or null p53, after
radiation treatment, miR-302a and miR-302c up-regulated,
and miR-518f down-regulated in colon cancer cells,
whereas after SN38 treatment up-regulated miRNAs were
miR-133a, miR-155, miR-204, miR-22, miR-512-3p,
miR-517a, miR-517c and miR-708 in the all colon cancer
cell lines. Most of these miRNAs are not extensively
studied till now. However, the majority of the miRNAs
were dys-regulated by radiation and SN38 treatment was
largely dependent on p53 status of the HCT116 cells, i.e.,
either wt type or mutated p53. Generally, p53 suppresses
the conversion from arrest to senescence (geroconversion)
[25], Wt p53 seems to have three independent effects:
apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and gerosuppression. By
inducing arrest, wt p53 primes cells for senescence,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mice with increased, but normally regulated, p53 lives
longer [26]. p53 knockout mice have both accelerated
carcinogenesis and decreased longevity [27]. While
the loss of p53 by itself makes cells prone to become
tumorigenic, an increased rate of organismal aging in the
absence of p53 may further accelerate carcinogenesis.
In HCT116p53+/+ cells, after the radiation 42 miRNAs
and after SN38 treatment 22 miRNAs were up-regulated,
whereas after the radiation only 3 miRNAs and one after
SN38 were down-regulated. In HCT116p53+/- cells, after
the radiation 7 miRNAs were up-regulated and after
SN38 treatment 18 miRNAs were up-regulated, whereas
after radiation 14 miRNAs and after SN38 treatment 13
miRNAs were down-regulated. In HCT116p53-/- cells, after
the radiation 14 miRNAs were up-regulated and after
SN38 treatment 18 miRNAs were up-regulated and 2
miRNAs were down-regulated, respectively. Moreover,
from EBarrays, we found miRNAs, such as let-7f-5p,
miR-455-3p, miR-98, miR-155-5p, up-regulated to the
highest degree and miRNAs, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR142-5p, miR-202-5p were down-regulated most, after the

radiation and SN38 treatment. Changes in the expressions
of these miRNAs were also largely depending on p53
status. Such as, let-7f-5p and miR-455-3p and miR98 were up-regulated most after radiation and SN38
treatment in HCT116p53+/+ cells, whereas miR-155-5p was
up-regulated mostly in HCT116p53-/- cells after radiation
and in HCT116p53+/+ cells after SN38 treatment. mir-1 was
down-regulated after the radiation and SN38 treatment in
HCT116p53+/- and HCT116p53-/- cells. In miR-127-5p and
miR-142-5p the highest degree of down-regulation was
found in HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53+/- cells after the
radiation treatment. miR-202-5p was down-regulated in
HCT116p53-/- cells after the SN38 treatment. We also found
in KM12C and KM12L4a cells with p53 mutation, let-7f5p, miR-455-3p, miR-98, miR-155-5p and miRNAs were
up-regulated, whereas miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p
and miR-202-5p remained undetected after the radiation
and SN38 treatment.
We then were interested to study the pathways
of these miRNAs and to predict their relationships
with KEGG pathways by using DIANA-miRPath tool.
Relationships with the pathway of CRCs and almost every
sub-pathway contain target genes of these 8 miRNAs as
shown in Figure 4. Target genes of the 8 miRNAs are
distributed in all the sub-pathways, especially PI3K-Akt
signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway, although
K-ras is the mostly target gene of these miRNAs. These
pathways have been proven to play key roles in the overall
pathway of CRC development. Moreover, Let-7 miRNA precursor (includes let-7f-5p and miR-98) has been
demonstrated to be a direct regulator of RAS expression
in human cells [28], and direct inhibitor of HMGA2 by
binding to its 3′UTR [29]. Expression level of let-7 is
already proposed as a prognostic marker in several types of
cancers [30]. Increased expression of let-7 miRNA is also
associated with CRC [31]. p53 plays a key role in induction
of both tristetraprolin and let-7 in human cancer cells [32].
Intranasal administration of let-7 has already been found
effective in reducing tumor growth in a transgenic mouse
model of lung cancer and similar restoration of let-7 was
also shown to inhibit cell proliferation in several types of
tumors including colon cancer [33]. miR-98-5p is also
involved in the regulation of autophagy and predicted as
target genes in the Bcl2 family [34, 35]. Previously, miR455 is also recognized among a set of 6 miRNAs that are
deregulated in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model
of chemoresistant and a mesenchymal phenotype [36]
as well in esophageal carcinoma cell lines [37] whereas
the same is also reported to be up-regulated in CRC [38],
which is similar with our findings, up-regulated miR
455 was down-regulated after the radiation and SN38
treatment. Contrary result, i.e. significant down-regulation
of miR-455 is also reported in colon cancer along with its
possible inhibitory role in proliferation and invasion of
CRC by targeting RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonineprotein kinase [39]. miR-155-5p and miR-146-5p
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were first identified as NF-κB regulatory key factors to
innate and adaptive immune responses [40, 41]. It is also
involved in IL8 regulation like miR-155-5p by lowering
SHIP1 expression [42], miR-155-5p antagonists also
exhibit possible therapeutic value in chronic inflammatory
diseases, by modulating activation of macrophages
and the number of circulating granulocytic cells [43].
miR-155-5p is also reported to be up-regulated in colon
cancer. A combination of miR-155 level in colon cancer
with the serum CEA level (both pre- and postoperatively)
can afford more accurate information for diagnosis
and prognosis, especially for predicting recurrence and
metastasis postoperatively [44]. Deregulation of miR-1 is
also reported earlier in CRC [45]. The expression level of
miR-127-5p is used for determining the likelihood of CRC
recurrence [46]. miR-142-5p is un regulated after NGX6
transfection in colon cancer cells [47]. miR-202-5p is also
frequently down-regulated in gastric cancer. Transcriptional
factor Gli1 is a target of miR-202-3p and plays an essential
role as a mediator of the biological effects of miR-202-5p
in gastric cancer. MiR-202-5p also inhibits the expression
of γ-catenin and BCL-2. It seems that miR-202-5p may
function as a novel tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, and
its anti-tumor activity may attribute the direct targeting and
inhibition of Gli1 [48].
The chronic inflammatory microenvironment
consists of immune, inflammatory and stromal cells, all
of which produce cytokines, growth factors and adhesion
molecules that may sustain tumor growth, progression and
spreading [49, 50]. In the present study, cytokines, IL-6,
TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, VEGF, and chemokines, IL-8,
MIP-1α increased, and IFN-γ expression decreased after
radiation, whereas, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10
and IL-8 decreased, and VEGF and MIP-1α increased after
SN38 treatment. Furthermore we found that the increased
or decreased expression level of cytokines IL-6, TNF-α,
IFN-γ, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, VEGF and of chemokines, IL8, MIP-1α after radiation and SN38 treatment in a p53
dependent or independent manner.
Reduced IL-6 expression was observed after the
SN38 treatment in all the cell lines regardless of p53
status. Commonly IL-6 involved in inflammation, cell
growth, apoptosis, aging, and also induces an acute
phase response. So decrease in IL6 expression possibly
has some role in therapeutic aspect of colon cancer. A
similar trend of reduction was noticed in case of IFN-γ,
IL-1β, IL-4, which are considered pro-inflammatory in
nature. It is reported that tumor associated macrophages
protect colon cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis
through IL-1β-dependent stabilization of Snail in tumor
cells [51]. IL-1β also reported to promote epithelialmesenchymal transition, stemness and invasiveness of
colon cancer cells through Zeb factors [52]. Epithelial
interleukin-4 receptor expression promotes colon tumor
growth and mediates drug resistance in colon cancer stem
cells [53, 54]. Increased IL-6 expression has been related
44773

Oncotarget

to advanced stage and decreased survival in CRC patients
[55]. Overexpression of IL-8 promotes tumor growth,
angiogenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance, implying
IL-8 to be an important therapeutic target in CRCs [56].
Utility of IL-8 as a biomarker for CRC detection and
identification of high risk patients is also established
[57]. Increased level of IL-10 is strongly associated with
the progression of CRCs [58]. Our results also showed
the reduction of IL-10 level after the SN38 treatment.
IL-6 induced a STAT3-mediated IL-10 production in
colon tumor cells is also reported [59]. Counter results
- inverse association with tumor progression is also
known [60]. In a nutshell, the immunostimulatory
versus immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 marks it
as a possible new therapeutic in tumor immunity [61].
IFN-γ (IFNG) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that
modulates many immune-related genes and shapes the
tumor microenvironment in such a way that it shows both
anti- and pro-tumorigenic activities [62–64]. VEGF-1
expression in CRCs is associated with disease localization,
stage, identification of patients at high risk for disease
progression and long-term disease-specific survival [65].
TNF-α promote colorectal tumorigenesis by stimulating
glycolysis and growth factor production in CRC cells
[66]. Interrupting tumor cell-macrophage communication
by targeting TNF-α may provide an alternative therapeutic
approach for the treatment of colon cancer [67].
We surprisingly found that IFN-γ did not interact
with any of the 8 most up- and down-regulated miRNAs.
Cytokines under consideration in general do not
discriminate between up- and down-regulated miRNAs;
interacts with both up- and down-regulated miRNA,
except IL-4 and TNF-alpha, which interact only with
up- and down-regulated miRNAs, respectively. let-7f-5p
demonstrates the highest number of cytokine interaction,
all other miRNAs, except miR-142-3p, exhibit
interactions with multiple cytokines. It is possible
that the production of various cytokines and their
interaction with miRNA could play an important role
in tumor growth and resistance or response to different
treatment modalities. Hence, targeting tumor-producing
cytokines and miRNAs could reduce tumor repopulation
by eliminating tumor cells. Generally, the regulation
of cytokine expression by miRNAs can be mediated
through either direct binding of a miRNA to a target
mRNA 3′UTR seed region in the cytokine mRNA, or by
indirectly modulating adenine and uridine-rich elements
binding proteins [68]. The interaction of miRNAs and
cytokines contributes to the complex inter-cellular
regulatory network, and might be a link between chronic
inflammation and a variety of diseases, including colon
cancer. The cytokines and growth factors produced by
cancer cells function to create optimal growth conditions
within the tumor microenvironment, while cytokines
secreted by stromal cells may influence the behavior
of malignant cells [69]. Therefore, it is necessary to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

develop a new approach for disrupting tumor-cytokinemiRNA networks to increase the treatment efficacy.
Targeting miRNAs, therefore, may be a new therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of colon cancer in the coming
decades.
In the present study, we examined the expression
of miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines, and hopefully the
findings expanded our knowledge of p53 responses in
colon cancer after radiation and SN38 treatment. However
this study has several limitations for a deep understanding
the biology of how these miRNAs affect CRC treatments
and the pathways. Up- or down-regulated miRNA need
to be validated through q-PCR. Their functional roles
in more cell lines and even animal models should be
studied. We also need to validate the functional roles of
these miRNAs and pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators
to confirm its functional use in patients, especially in
the patients with clinical trials of radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. Ultimately, understanding how changes in
miRNA expression and function at each of these miRNA
contribute will be necessary to fully understand the p53
responses in CRC pathogenesis. The accumulated data of
dysregulated miRNAs may be incorporated into diagnosis
and therapies of CRC patients and used for better treatment
selection. If we could consider to use anti- or mimics of
miRNAs or control the level of cyto- or chemokines, it
might be more effective way of treatment of colon cancer
rather than alone conventional treatments. The outcome
of this investigation help to identify the most important
miRNAs and cyto- or chemokines related to radiation and
SN38 treatment in colon cancer to be targeted, which may
have significant clinical importance for better management
of colon cancer in the future.
In summary, after radiation and SN38 treatment, we
found that most significant up- or down-regulation and
interactions of 8 miRNAs (let-7f-5p, miR-455-3p, miR98, miR-155-5p, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p, miR202-5p), 7 cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN- γ,
VEGF, TNF- α) and 2 chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1-α) were
dependent on p53 status in colon cancer cells. Still now,
the successful development of miRNA-based therapeutics
for CRC has many challenging hurdles to overcome. The
best miRNAs to be targeted in CRC are yet to be defined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture conditions
Three human colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116,
were a kind gift from Dr. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University). HCT116, which produces wild-type p53
(HCT116p53+/+), heterozygous p53 (HCT116p53+/-),
which has a single p53 allele disrupted and its p53-null
counterpart HCT116p53-/-, in which the both alleles of p53
were deleted by means of homologous recombination
[70]. The HCT116 cells with truncated p53 and missing
44774

40 amino acid residues are considered functionally p53
negative [70]. The cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented
with 10% FBS (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1.5
mM L-glutamine (GIBCO) and 1X PEST (GIBCO) at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Other 2 human colon carcinoma cell lines,
KM12C and KM12L4a (p53 mutant) with different
metastatic potential, were kindly provided by Prof.
Isaiah Fidler (Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX). The cell lines were maintained in Eagle’s MEM
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, vitamins and a cocktail
of penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in 5% carbon
dioxide. Cells growing in the exponential phase were
harvested at approximately 80% confluency and used for
the experiments.

XTT assay. The assay is based on the cleavage of the
yellow tetrazolium salt XTT (2, 3-Bis (2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carbox-anilide)
into a soluble orange formazan dye. This reaction is
attributed mainly to the succinate-tetrazolium reductase
system in the mitochondria of metabolically active cells.
The absorbance measured at 450 nm is proportional to
the number of viable cells. Experiments were repeated
two times independently for cytokine and chemokine
analysis.

Radiation procedure

Reverse transcription and miRNA qPCR arrays

To evaluate the effect of radiation, the cells were
seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 9.5 cm2 surface area
plates, and radiated with a 6 MV photon spectra using a
linear accelerator (Clinac 4/100, Varian; PaloAlo, CA).
The cells were positioned below 3 cm PMMA, 105 cm
from the photon source (the distance from the photon
source to the PMMA-surface was 100 cm). Acrylic glass
plates were placed above (3 cm thick) and underneath
(10 cm thick) the cells. The cells were exposed to 2Gy
radiation at room temperature. Following radiation on the
three HCT116 cell lines, the cells were harvested after 2
hr for analysis of miRNAs and 2 hr, 48 hr for cytokines
and chemokines analysis. For the both cytokine and
chemokine analyses, the cell supernatants were used.

Expression profiling of miRNAs was performed
by using TLDAs. TaqMan® Array Human MicroRNA
Card A Set v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
enabled quantification of 384 human miRNAs and U6
snRNA (001973) endogenous controls that was used
for data normalization. Megaplex miRNA RT primers
with special stem-loop structure allowed synthesis
of all cDNAs. A reverse transcription reaction was
performed by using the TaqMan® MicroRNA reverse
transcription kit and Megaplex™ RT primers, human
pool A v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
cDNA samples were pre-amplified by using Megaplex™
Pre Amp primers and TaqMan® Pre amp master mix
(Applied Biosystems).
The reverse transcriptase mixture consisted of
100 ng of RNA sample, 100 mM of dNTPs, 50 U/ml
of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, 0.80 ml/reaction
Megaplex RT primers (10X), 0.80 ml/reaction10X RT
buffer, 20 U/ml RNase inhibitor and 25 mM MgCl2 (all
part of TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit;
Applied Biosystems). Reaction mixtures were incubated
for 2 min at 16°C, 1 min. at 42 °C and 1 sec. at 50°C
for 40 cycles, then 5 min. at 85°C and finally held at
4°C (Gradient thermal cycler; Applied Biosystems). Preamplification reaction was also performed according to
manufacturer’s instruction for 12 cycles. Real-time
PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7900
HT Version 2.3 Sequence Detection System. Each 900
ml PCR reaction mixture consisted of 9 ml of diluted
pre amplified RT product, 450 ml of TaqMan (No
UmpErase UNG) Universal PCR Master Mix and 441
ml of nuclease free water. Then 100 ml of each PCR
reaction mix was dispensed into each port of the TaqMan
MicroRNA Array. Reactions were run at 50°C for 2
min., 95°C for 10 min., followed by 40 cycles at 95°C
for 30 sec. and 60°C for 1 min. The expression levels
of 379 miRNAs and 5 control assays were analyzed

miRNA extraction
After 2 hr of 2Gy radiation treatment as well as
after 48 hr of SN38 treatment, total RNA including was
extracted using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit
(Invitrogen, Catalog Number AM1560).

SN38 treatment of colon cancer cells in vitro
The cells were plated at a density 50000 cells/cm2.
Freshly prepared SN38 (Tocris Bioscience, UK) was added
24 hr after seeding the cells. The cells were further cultured
for 48 hr before harvesting for miRNA extraction, and
three HCT116 cell supernatant were used for the cytokines
and chemokines analysis. Cancer cells with 50% growth
inhibition after SN38 treatment were considered IC50 dose
of SN38 and were used for the present experiment.

Assay for determination of IC50 for SN38
Cellular viability and IC50 for SN38 were
determined using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were
seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 in 96 well plates
and allowed to attach for 24 hr. Freshly prepared SN38
(Tocris Bioscience, UK) was then added with a final
concentration ranging from 0 to 1000 nM. After 48 hr
of treatment cellular viability was determined using the

Cytokine and chemokine analysis in Meso Scale
Discovery instrument

Data analysis

HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53+/- and HCT116p53-/- cell lines
were treated by 2Gy radiation and SN38, respectively, and
cell supernatant were collected. Following treatment the
samples were centrifuged and supernatant was collected
for further study in a cytokine and chemokine assay by
Meso Scale Discovery (MSD). Cytokines (human cytokine
30 plex kit, V-plex, catalogue number K15054D-1, MSD,
MD) including GM-CSF, IL-15, IL-1α, IL-16, IL-5, IL-17,
IL-7, TNF-β, IL-12/23p40, VEGF and pro-inflammatory
cytokines IFN-γ, IL-8 (high-ab), IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IL12p70, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, TNF-α, and 10 chemokine (human
cytokine 30 plex kit, V-plex, catalogue number K15054D-1,
MSD, MD) including MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TARC, Eotaxin,
Eotaxin-3, MCP-1, MCP-4, MDC, IP-10 and IL-8 (chem)
were analyzed by the assay. The Human Cytokine 30Plex Panel Kit provides assay-specific components for
the quantitative determination of 30 cytokines in human
cell culture supernatants. Measurements were taken in a
SECTOR Imager 2400 instrument (Meso Scale Discovery,
MD). The principle of MSD is based on a reaction in
which an electron transfer in electrochemically generated
intermediates causes these molecules to enter an excited
state. Once, excited these molecules can emit a photon of
light when re-entering a lower energy level. Initially, capture
antibodies are coated onto the surface of a plate. Samples
are then incubated on the plate followed by the addition
of an electrochemiluminescent tagged antibody. Analysis
of this plate reveals luminescent regions in which specific
interactions have occurred between the antibodies and
analyte, allowing both a quantitative and qualitative analysis
of the desired compound. This method is highly sensitive,
has low background, does not incorporate washing steps
and most importantly, allows the detection of multiple
analytes at the same time. For all of the samples and all of

Ct (Cycle threshold) values were calculated using
the SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Using the
statistical computing environment R raw Ct values were
then normalized with qPCRNorm quantile normalization,
a data-driven normalization strategy for high-throughput
qPCR data [71]. The comparative threshold cycle
method was used to calculate the amplification factor.
Radiation or drug-induced modulation of miRNA gene
expression was calculated by the ∆∆Ct method, using
the untreated cells as calibrator sample. N-fold change
of the miRNA expression between treated and untreated
samples was obtained using the formula 2−∆∆Ct. The data
is presented as log2 (T/N) values, where log2 (T/N) was
calculated

as

Values

were considered as up-regulation of miRNAs. Heatmap
provides a convenient way to visualize clustering
of features and samples at the same time, and show
the levels of values. Heatmap can be based on either
Pearson correlation coefficients or Euclidean distance
clustering. Euclidean-based heatmap will focus on the
magnitude of different values, whereas Pearson clusters
the samples based on similarities between the different
profiles. Here Euclidean-based heatmap is used to show
the levels of log2 (T/N) values from different therapy
data. Further statistical analysis and visualization were
performed by HTqPCR, a package of R that enables the
processing and analysis of high-throughput quantitative
real-time PCR data [72].

Data normalization and EBarrays statistical
analysis

the analytes a z-score was calculated as . Samples
were considered up-regulated if the z-score was greater than
1.96 and down-regulated if the z-score was less than −1.96,
corresponding to a p-value of 0.05.

The Empirical Bayes mixture method
implemented in the R-package EBarrays [73] was used
for analyzing differential expression (DE) of miRNAs
in the colon cancer cells. Initially we normalized the Ct
values (Ctnorm). The Ctnorm values were then transformed

plugged into the local false discovery rate (threshold on
the false discovery rate to be 0.01) procedure to find the
significant DEi adjusted for multiple comparisons. The
numbers of overlapping significant miRNAs between
the cell lines were visualized with Venn-diagrams.

The regulatory effect of miRNAs in biological
processes is normally executed by groups of these noncoding RNAs that act in a coordinated manner. The
clustering and grouping of the target genes of miRNAs
were performed to investigate the overall effect of the
miRNAs regulatory effect. DIANA-miRPath [74] is an
online computational application that identifies potentially
altered biological pathways by the expression of single or
multiple miRNAs, which is based on miRNA and pathway
related information obtained from miRBase [75] and
KEGG [76]. DIANA-miRPath can predict miRNA target

genes by high accuracy based on DIANA-microT-CDS
[77] or by experimental verification from Tarbase and
then perform different analysis to them, like hierarchical
clustering. We chose 4 most significant up-regulation
miRNAs and 4 most significant down-regulating miRNAs
to predict their relationship with KEGG pathways by using
DIANA-miRPath.

Relationship of miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines
By using online tools including TargetScan [78],
PicTar [79], miRanda [80], DIANA-microT [81],
RNA22 v2 [82], RepTar [83], and PITA [84] with default
parameters, we predicted the possible interactions of
miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines. The analyses were
based on most up-regulated and most down-regulated
of the miRNAs as well as cyto- and chemokines that
increased or decreased significantly, after the radiation
and SN38 treatment depending on p53 status of all the
three cell lines.
