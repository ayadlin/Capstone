ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin (Doxo) is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs for
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Doxo is a DNA intercalating drug that
inhibits topoisomerase II. Thereby Doxo has the ability to block DNA replication and
induce apoptosis. However, the other targets and mechanisms through which Doxo
induces apoptosis to treat HCC still remain unknown. Here, we identified Mucosal
vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (Madcam1) as a potential Doxo target
because Madcam1 overexpression suppressed, while Madcam1 depletion stimulated
Doxo-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we first revealed that Doxo can induce
apoptosis by blocking protein translation initiation. In contrast, Madcam1 activated
protein translation through an opposite mechanism. We also found de-phosphorylation
of AKT may be an important pro-apoptotic event that is triggered by Doxo-induced
Madcam1 down-regulation. Finally, we revealed that Madcam1 promoted increased
AKT phosphorylation, which is essential for maintaining the sensitivity of HCC cells
to Doxo treatment. Taken together, we uncovered a potential mechanism for Doxoinduced apoptosis in HCC treatment through targeting Madcam1 and AKT and blocking
protein translation initiation.

INTRODUCTION

are primarily located in the cell nuclei, which increases
challenges such as poor intracellular drug delivery.
Therefore, other potential Doxo targets, especially
the proteins located at either the cell membrane or the
cytoplasm, need to be urgently revealed. Combined use
of specific inhibitor against such Doxo targets with Doxo
may enhance the efficacy of Doxo in treating HCC.
Madcam1 was originally identified as an endothelial

Doxo is one of the most widely used
chemotherapeutic drugs for HCC treatment [1-3]. Doxo is
a DNA intercalating drug that inhibits topoisomerase II [45]. Thereby Doxo has the ability to block DNA replication

cell adhesion molecule that directs leukocytes into mucosal
and inflamed tissues [6]. Madcam1 is overexpressed in
pancreatic tumor and lymphoma [7-9], suggesting that
Madcam1 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. However,
no studies have currently focused on the function
of Madcam1 in HCC. Whether and how Madcam1
participates in the Doxo-induced apoptosis in HCC cells
remains elusive.
To date, several studies have demonstrated that the
inhibition or stimulation of growth/survival signaling
pathways ultimately leads to Doxo-induced cell death
in HCC [10-18]. Among these signaling pathways, AKT
signaling has been clearly linked to the pathogenesis of
HCC [19-21]. A recent study suggests that the use of AKT
inhibitors in combination with Doxo may be an attractive
therapeutic regimen for HCC treatment [22]. However, the
precise relationship between AKT and Doxo is unknown.
In this study, we identified Madcam1 as a potential
Doxo target. Although Madcam1 could be down-regulated
by Doxo, Madcam1 had an anti-apoptotic function against
Doxo. Furthermore, we determined that Doxo induces
apoptosis in HCC cells by inhibiting protein translation
initiation. We also revealed a novel auto-regulatory loop
between Madcam1 and AKT, which plays important roles
in the regulation of apoptosis. Finally, we revealed that
Madcam1 promoted increased AKT phosphorylation,
which is essential for maintaining the sensitivity of HCC
cells to Doxo treatment. Thus, we suggested that the use of
a Madcam1 inhibitor could enhance the efficacy of Doxo
in HCC treatment.

apoptosis in HCC cells but not in normal hepatocytes.
Induced apoptosis is usually accompanied by reduced cell
proliferation. Therefore, we tested whether Doxo inhibits
cell proliferation. We found that compared to cells treated
with DMSO, the Doxo-treated SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402
cells had a much lower cell proliferation activity (Figure
1D). In contrast, Doxo was also unable to significantly
reduce cell proliferation in HL-7702 cells (Figure 1D).
One purpose of this study is to identify the potential
Doxo target(s). Compared to nuclear proteins, cytoplasmic
and membrane proteins are much more easily accessed by
Doxo in the circulation. Thus, we examined the expression
of a series of cancer-related proteins that might bind to
the cell membrane before and after Doxo treatment in
Bel-7402 cells. We found that Madcam1 was the best
candidate that could be down-regulated by Doxo (Figure
1E-1F). In addition to the fact that endogenous Madcam1
could be dose-dependently down-regulated by Doxo in
both SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 cells (Supplementary
Figure 1A-1B), exogenous Madcam1-Myc could also
be down-regulated by Doxo in Bel-7402 cells (Figure
1G-1H). By adding the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX) to Bel-7402 cells, Madcam1 was
observed as the most unstable protein of the proteins
tested (Supplementary Figure 1C). This may explain why
Madcam1 had the most rapid response to Doxo treatment.
We then investigated the subcellular localization
of Madcam1 in HCC cells. Madcam1 was detected in
the cytoplasm but not in the membrane, not only in
established HCC cell lines (Figure 1I) but also in HCC
tissues (Supplementary Figure 1D), indicating that in
addition to its functions as a surface adhesion molecule
that mediates cell-to-cell interactions, Madcam1 may have
other important functions in HCC cells.
Next, we investigated how Doxo down-regulates
Madcam1. We found that Doxo did not significantly
change the mRNA levels of Madcam1 in both Bel-7402
and SMMC-7721 cells (Figure 1J). Furthermore, Doxo
was unable to accelerate Actinomycin D (a transcription
inhibitor)-reduced Madcam1 mRNA levels in Bel-7402
cells (Figure 1K). These results excluded the possibility
that Doxo suppresses Madcam1 expression by reducing
its transcription and RNA stability. We also found no
significant differences in the CHX-reduced Madcam1 to
GAPDH protein ratios between DMSO- and Doxo-treated
cells (Figure 1L-1M), suggesting that Doxo does not
reduce Madcam1 protein stability. Then, we tested whether
Doxo suppresses the translation of Madcam1 protein.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) plays an important
role in protein translation by facilitating the recruitment
of other translation factors and the 40S ribosomal subunit
to the corresponding mRNAs [26-27]. Using RNA-IP
followed by RT-qPCR, we observed a kinetic decrease of
eIF4E binding to the Madcam1 mRNA after Doxo was
added to both Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells (Figure
1N-1O), demonstrating that Doxo suppresses Madcam1

RESULTS
Doxorubicin induced apoptosis and reduced
Madcam1 expression in HCC cells
In this study, the HCC cell line Bel-7402 was
selected because Bel-7402 cells are sensitive to Doxo
[23]. Another HCC cell line, SMMC-7721, that exhibits
similar carcinogenic properties as Bel-7402 [23-24],
and a hepatocyte line, HL-7702, that shows a significant
difference from HCC cells [25], were also included in
parallel experiments.
First, we examined whether Doxo stimulates
apoptosis in HCC cells by testing the cleavage of Caspase
substrates (CCS) using an anti-cleaved Caspase substrate
antibody that recognizes the endogenous levels of
Caspase-cleaved proteins with a carboxy-terminal aspartic
acid residue. We found that Doxo dose-dependently
elevated CCS levels in both SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402
cells (Figure 1A-1B). We also noticed that Doxo treatment
led to significantly induced Caspase 3/7 activities in
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 cells, but not in HL-7702
cells (Figure 1C), suggesting that Doxo can only induce

dependent decreases in Madcam1 levels in HCC cells
treated with increasing concentrations of Doxo (Figure
1A and Supplementary Figure 1A). Here, we compared
CCS and Madcam1 levels in different cells with or without
Doxo treatment, and found that the most significantly
increased CCS levels were accompanied by the most

cells, mildly increased CCS levels were accompanied with

and there was no decrease of either the CCS or Madcam1
levels in HL-7702 cells (Figure 2A-2B). These results
led us to propose that Madcam1 may function against
Doxo in the regulation of apoptosis. To address this, we
added Doxo into control and Madcam1 overexpressing
or knockdown cells. We found that Doxo induced less
accumulation of CCS in Madcam1 overexpressing Bel7402 and SMMC-7721 cells compared to the control
(Figure 2C-2D). In contrast, Doxo treatment induced a
greater accumulation of CCS in Madcam1 knockdown
Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells compared to the control
(Figure 2E-2F). However, neither overexpression nor
depletion of Madcam1 expression in Doxo-treated or
untreated HL-7702 cells significantly changed the CCS
levels (Supplementary Figure 2).
Using an early apoptosis detection kit from
Cell Signaling Technology LTD (CST), we found that
Madcam1 overexpression resulted in delayed Doxoinduced apoptosis (Figure 2G). Furthermore, Doxo
was capable of inducing significant cleaved Caspase 3
expression (Figure 2H), and increased levels of cleaved
Caspase 3 are regarded as a hallmark of apoptosis
[28]. However, the Doxo increase in the cleaved
Caspase 3 levels was significantly reduced in Madcam1
overexpressing Bel-7402 cells compared to the control
cells (Figure 2H). The data from testing the Caspase 3/7
activities in Madcam1 overexpressing or knockdown Bel7402 and SMMC-7721 cells were also in accord with
these results (Figure 2I). Collectively, we suggested that
Madcam1 may protect HCC cells from Doxo-induced
apoptosis.
Madcam1 overexpression and knockdown appears
to change the course of Doxo-induced apoptosis (Figure
2C-2I). However, it is not known whether Madcam1
changes the time course or overall level of Doxo-induced
apoptosis. We found that Doxo treatment significantly
increased Caspase 3/7 activity in both Bel-7402 and
SMMC-7721 cells in a time-dependent manner, and
reached a peak at approximately 16 h, then decreased
gradually (Figure 2J-2K). Furthermore, compared to the
control, Madcam1 knockdown enhanced, while Madcam1
overexpression attenuated Doxo-induced Caspase 3/7
activities (Figure 2J-2K). Interestingly, the time course
of Doxo-induced apoptosis was not changed by either
Madcam1 knockdown or overexpression (Figure 2J-2K).
These results suggested that Madcam1 could only change
the overall level, but not the time course of Doxo-induced
apoptosis.
Then, we tested whether changes in Madcam1 leads
to functional differences in the HCC cells. We found
that Madcam1 knockdown significantly impaired cell
proliferation in both Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells, as
analyzed by an MTT-based assay (Figure 2L). However,
Madcam1 overexpression in HCC cells had no significant
influence on cell proliferation (Figure 2L), which may be
because endogenous Madcam1 is already overloaded in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCC cells (Figure 7A-7B). Similarly, in xenograft mouse
models, we found that only Madcam1 knockdown could
lead to impaired tumor growth from Bel-7402 cells in vivo
(Figure 2M). These results suggested that Madcam1 can
not only change the Caspase levels, but it also functional
in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in HCC
cells.

Doxorubicin and Madcam1 controlled protein
translation initiation
Then, we investigated the potential mechanisms by
which Doxo regulates apoptosis in HCC cells by screening
targets using a human apoptosis antibody array from
Abcam. As shown in Figure 3A, the density of the signals
for the positive control were similar between samples,
suggesting that the cell lysates from DMSO- or Doxotreated Bel-7402 cells were loaded equally onto the arrays.
We were confident with the array data because the spot
signals for three proteins, HSP27, IGF-II and sTNF-R1,
were stronger in the Doxo-treated samples compared to
the DMSO-treated control (Figure 3A). These results were
consistent with the observations from other studies that
described that these three proteins can be induced by Doxo
[29-31]. Furthermore, these same Doxo-treated samples
that were loaded onto the array showed significantly
induced CCS levels (Figure 3B), further demonstrating
the high quality of the samples. Interestingly, the signals
representing the other apoptosis-related proteins were
much weaker in the Doxo-treated samples compared to
the DMSO-treated control (Figure 3A), suggesting that
Doxo may control protein expression through a common
mechanism.
Because Madcam1 had opposite functions in
the regulation of apoptosis, we hypothesized that
Madcam1knockdown has similar results to Doxo
treatment. As expected, Madcam1knockdown led to
a decrease of almost all of the tested target proteins,
including Madcam1 itself (Figure 3C-3D), indicating
the important role of Madcam1 in maintaining protein
homeostasis. To verify the results from the arrays, we
re-examined three pro-apoptotic proteins, including Fas,
Bax and p73, and three anti-apoptotic proteins, including
Livin, Bcl-2 and Survivin, before and after the treatments
listed above. Among these six proteins, five proteins were
already included in the array, and p73 was added to avoid
systematic error generated by the array-based analysis.
By performing the experiments in Bel-7402 and HL-7702
cells, we found that Doxo treatment led to a significant
decrease in protein expression only in Bel-7402 cells, but
not in HL-7702 cells (Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure
3A), suggesting that Doxo only reduces protein expression
in HCC cells but not in hepatocytes. In Madcam1 depleted
Bel-7402 cells, down-regulation of protein expression
was also observed (Figure 3F and Supplementary Figure

3B). The above results suggested a negative correlation
between Doxo and Madcam1 in the regulation of protein
expression.
Next, we investigated how Doxo and Madcam1
regulate protein expression. First, we examined the

corresponding mRNA levels of these six proteins by
qPCR, and found that the mRNA levels were not reduced
by either Doxo treatment or Madcam1 knockdown
(Figure 3G-3H), suggesting both Doxo and Madcam1
did not influence transcription or RNA stability. We

further excluded the possibility that Doxo or Madcam1
suppresses or stimulates protein stability because the
reduced protein ratios at the beginning and end of CHX
treatment were similar between paired DMSO- and
Doxo-treated Bel-7402 cells, as well as paired control
and Madcam1 overexpressing Bel-7402 cells (Figure
3I-3J and Supplementary Figure 3C-3D). The results
obtained from these six proteins were quite similar with
those from Madcam1; therefore, we tested whether Doxo
or Madcam1 impact the translation of these proteins.
As expected, we found that eIF4E enrichment to these
mRNAs was significantly reduced in Doxo-treated
or Madcam1 knockdown Bel-7402 cells (Figure 3K),
suggesting that both Doxo and Madcam1 influence
eIF4E-mediated translation initiation. Then, we tried to
assemble the conditions under which protein translation
is inhibited using a protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX. We
found that CHX induced the CCS level increased more
significantly than other drugs, including Doxo, CHX,
Actinomycin D (transcription inhibitor) and MG132
(proteasome inhibitor) (Supplementary Figure 3E-3F).
Furthermore, CHX-induced CCS levels were detected in
Bel-7402, SMMC-7721 and HL-7702 cells (Figure 3L3M), suggesting that inhibiting protein synthesis can also
lead to apoptosis.

Doxorubicin suppressed,
stimulated eIF4E activation

while

4EBP1 levels in the immunoprecipitations with antieIF4E antibodies (Figure 4E), suggesting that Doxo
stimulates 4EBP1 binding to eIF4E. In contrast, Madcam1
overexpression resulted in a decreased concentration of
4EBP1 in protein complexes immunoprecipitated by antieIF4E antibodies (Figure 4F), indicating that Madcam1
facilitates the release of eIF4E from the eIF4E-4EBP1
complexes.
Then, we investigated the subcellular organelle
localization of Madcam1 by confocal microscopy using a
combination of anti-Madcam1 antibodies and antibodies
against protein markers of different organelles. We
found that Madcam1 was significantly co-localized with
Calnexin, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
in the cytoplasm (Figure 4G). Because the ER interacts
directly with the ribosomes, which are intracellular protein
factories [33], the overlap of Madcam1 with ER further
indicates that Madcam1 may stimulate protein synthesis.
However, we did not detect any obvious co-localization
signals with LC3B (autophagosome marker), COXIV
(mitochondria marker) and NUP98 (nuclear envelop
marker) (Figure 4G), suggesting that Madcam1 does
not functions in autophagy or mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis.
Next, we tried to determine whether Madcam1
is a direct target of Doxo in its regulation of protein
translation. We found that Madcam1 overexpression could
partially reverse the Doxo-induced de-phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 (Figure 4H and Supplementary Figure 4D),
down-regulation of protein expression (Figure 4I and
Supplementary Figure 4E) and dissociation of eIF4E from
the target mRNAs (Figure 4J), suggesting that Doxoinduced apoptosis and Doxo-impaired protein translation
may, at least in part, occur by targeting Madcam1.

Madcam1

To further understand the mechanism by which
Doxo reduces protein translation initiation, we screened
possible target(s) that may influence translation using a
translational control antibody screening kit from CST. We
found that Doxo treatment only resulted in a decrease in
the p-4EBP1 level, but had no significant effects on the
phosphorylation of other proteins (Figure 4A). To exclude
the possibility that the down-regulation of p-4EBP1
was due to the down-regulation of total 4EBP1, we reexamined p-4EBP1 and total 4EBP1 in DMSO- or Doxotreated Bel-7402 cells, and found that only p-4EBP1
was down-regulated, while total 4EBP1 had no obvious
changes (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4A).
Then, we tested whether Madcam1 stimulates 4EBP1
phosphorylation and observed an up-regulation of the
p-4EBP1/total-4EBP1 ratio in Madcam1 overexpressing
Bel-7402 cells (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure 4B),
while the p-4EBP1/total-4EBP1 ratio was down-regulated
in Madcam1 knockdown Bel-7402 cells (Figure 4D and
Supplementary Figure 4C).
It has been reported that hyperphosphorylated
4EBP1 prevents it from binding to and inhibiting eIF4E
[32]. Therefore, we hypothesized that Doxo and Madcam1
may have opposite roles in the interaction between 4EBP1
and eIF4E. To address this, we performed co-IP assays
and found that the Doxo dose-dependently increased the

AKT acted as a common target of Doxorubicin
and Madcam1
To enhance the efficacy of Doxo-mediated apoptosis
in HCC cells, it is important to identify the signaling
cascade(s) involved. Using a Pathscan™ apoptosis and
stress signaling array from CST, we found that AKT
phosphorylation at Thr308 was a potential target because
both Doxo treatment and Madcam1 knockdown in Bel7402 cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation at this
site (Figure 5A). By repeating these experiments in Bel7402 and SMMC-7721 cells, we demonstrated that Doxo
treatment only decreased the phosphorylated form of AKT
(p-Thr308-AKT, hereafter p-AKT) and was unable to
decrease total AKT (Figure 5B-5C). In contrast, Madcam1
overexpression led to increased p-AKT levels (Figure
5D-5E), while Madcam1 depletion with two independent
shRNAs led to decreased p-AKT levels (Figure 5F-5G).
Tissue microarray analysis (TMA) also demonstrated a
close correlation between p-AKT and Madcam1 in HCC

tissues (χ2 test, p = 0.000, Figure 5H-5I). These results
suggested that Madcam1 down-regulation may be an
intermediate step during Doxo-induced reductions in
p-AKT levels.
We described above that Doxo and Madcam1
regulate protein translation by controlling 4EBP1

phosphorylation. Here, we tested whether AKT also
increases 4EBP1 phosphorylation. By inhibiting PI3K/
AKT signaling with Wortmannin, a PI3K/AKT inhibitor,
we found that blocking PI3K/AKT decreased the
p-4EBP1 levels (Figure 5J-5K), which was similar to the
results from Doxo treatment or Madacam1 knockdown.

We also observed that Wortmannin treatment led to the
dissociation of eIF4E from the target mRNAs (Figure
5L), the subsequent down-regulation of protein expression
(Figure 5M-5N), and, finally, the remarkable induction of
apoptosis (Figure 5O). Because AKT inhibition resembled
Doxo treatment and Madcam1 knockdown, we suggested
that AKT may act as a common target of Doxo and
Madcam1.
Interestingly, we found that AKT inhibition by
either Wortmannin or AKT-shRNA led to a decrease in
Madcam1 (Supplementary Figure 5A-5B), suggesting that
AKT also has a positive feedback on Madcam1 regulation.

3/7 activities (Figure 6E). Similarly, co-overexpression
of AKT could rescue impaired cell proliferation in
Madcam1-depleted Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells,
whereas co-overexpression of Madcam1 was unable to
reverse impaired cell proliferation in AKT-depleted cells
(Figure 6F). These results suggested that AKT may act as
a downstream effector of Madcam1 in the regulation of
apoptosis and cell proliferation.

Doxorubicin sensitivity relied on the p-AKT level
On the basis of the data described above, we
hypothesized that the HCC-specific increased sensitivity
to Doxo may rely on the Madcam1-mediated increased
levels of p-AKT. To address this, we first examined
endogenous p-AKT in HCC and adjacent normal liver
tissues, and found both p-AKT and AKT were upregulated in the HCC tissues compared to the normal
liver (Figure 7A). However, we did not believe that the
high p-AKT expression levels were due to the high total
AKT expression levels because the ratios of AKT/GAPDH
were up-regulated 2- to 3-fold, while the ratios of p-AKT/
AKT were up-regulated more obviously (3- to 5-fold)
in the HCC tissues compared to the normal liver tissues
(Supplementary Figure 6A-6B). As expected, Madcam1
was also elevated in the HCC tissues compared to the
normal liver tissues (Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure
1D and 6C), suggesting that the up-regulated Madcam1
levels may be another factor, in addition to the elevations
in endogenous AKT levels, that stimulates p-AKT in vivo.
To simulate the HCC-like, increased p-AKT levels
in hepatocyte, we consequently overexpressed exogenous
AKT-Myc and Madcam1-Myc in HL-7702 cells, and
noticed a gradual up-regulation of the p-AKT levels
(Figure 7B-7C). This was accompanied by gradually
induced protein expression (Figure 7D-7E) and enhanced
eIF4E recruitment to the mRNAs (Figure 7F), which
ultimately reached levels resembling the Bel-7402 cells
(Figure 7B-7F). Then, we examined Doxo-induced
Caspase 3/7 activities in HL-7702 cells with different
p-AKT levels, as indicted in Figure 7B-7C, and found that
the extent of Doxo-induced Caspase 3/7 activities were
positively correlated with the p-AKT levels, which was
most obvious in HL-7702 cells with similar p-AKT levels
to the Bel-7402 cells (Figure 7G). These results suggested
that Doxo-induced apoptosis is more likely to occur in
HCC cells with high levels of Madcam1, p-AKT and
protein translation.
To further support the finding that p-AKT upregulation in hepatocytes is capable of inducing Doxo
sensitivity, we investigated whether p-AKT downregulation in HCC cells has the opposite effect. To
address this, we consequently knocked down Madcam1
and AKT, followed by Wortmannin treatment in Bel7402 cells, and found that the p-AKT level was gradually
decreased (Figure 7H-7I) and accompanied by gradually

Interaction between Madcam1 and AKT in the
regulation of apoptosis
To confirm the interaction between Madcam1 and
AKT, we performed reciprocal co-IP experiments in Bel7402 cells and found that exogenous Madcam1-FLAG
could be readily pulled down by AKT-Myc and vice versa
(Figure 6A). Co-IPs for endogenous AKT and Madcam1
proteins in Bel-7402 cells also demonstrated that these two
proteins readily co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 6B).
However, co-immunoprecipitation does not
necessarily mean there is a physical interaction between
proteins [34]. Thus, the potential interaction between
Madcam1 and AKT was further evaluated using the
Duolink™ in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) kit
and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Here, the
appearance of red fluorescent emission indicates a positive
interaction between Madcam1 and AKT. We only found
discrete bright red fluorescent emissions in the Bel-7402
and SMMC-7721 cells that were co-transfected with
exogenous AKT-Myc and Madcam1-FLAG, but not
in the cells without successful transfection of both of
the proteins (Figure 6C). Furthermore, red fluorescent
emissions were also detected in Bel-7402 and SMMC7721 cells co-incubated with both anti-Madcam1 and
anti-AKT antibodies (Figure 6D), suggesting endogenous
Madcam1 and AKT undergo protein–protein interactions.
However, red fluorescent emissions were not observed
in the negative controls, which were incubated without
antibodies (No Ab) or excluded one of the primary
antibodies, either anti-AKT or anti-Madcam1, further
validating our conclusion.
Then, we investigated the role of the AKT and
Madcam1 interaction in the regulation of apoptosis and
cell proliferation. We found that knocking down either
AKT or Madcam1 resulted in significantly increased
Caspase 3/7 activities in both Bel-7402 and SMMC7721 cells (Figure 6E). However, only the Madcam1
knockdown increases in the Caspase 3/7 activities
could be reduced by the simultaneous overexpression
of AKT, while overexpression of Madcam1 was unable
to reduce the AKT knockdown increases in the Caspase

in HCC treatment. The most ideal target(s) are cell
membrane-bound proteins. Although Madcam1 was
reported to bind integrin α4β7 and mediate lymphocyte
adhesion to vascular surfaces [35], no direct evidence has
indicated that Madcam1 is localized to the membrane. In
HCC cells, we found that Madcam1 was primarily located
in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the subcellular localization
of Madcam1 overlapped with the ER. We have described
that Madcam1 is associated with protein translation
initiation. Thus, we propose that Madcam1 may have
another function in regulating protein synthesis in HCC
cells.
Many publications have documented that the
overexpression of eIF4E may contribute to tumorigenesis
by inhibiting apoptosis, while enhanced expression or
activity of 4EBP promotes cell death [36-37]. Thus, we
suggest that the Doxo-induced pro-apoptotic phenotype in
HCC cells may result, in part, from the blockage of eIF4Emediated protein translation initiation because Doxo
prevents eIF4E release from the eIF4E-4EBP1 complexes.
Although Doxo-induced Madcam1 down-regulation is
also dependent on reduced eIF4E-mediated translation,
Madcam1 is more sensitive to Doxo. Because Madcam1
was the most unstable protein among the proteins tested,
this suggests that Madcam1 turnover is much more rapid
than other proteins and it may have a more rapid response
to Doxo treatment. Therefore, Madcam1 down-regulation
may be one of the first events to occur after Doxo begins
to suppress protein translation, and it acts as to initiate the
Doxo-induced pro-apoptotic cascade.
Doxo has attracted attention for use in combined
therapies with inhibitors against signaling pathways or
proteins that are important for tumor cell growth and
survival [38-41]. Because the Madcam1 protein can be
easily down-regulated by Doxo and functions to stimulate
anti-apoptotic AKT signaling, Madcam1 inhibition
not only decreases the expression of a protein that is
important during tumorigenesis but also blocks signaling
that may induce drug resistance. Therefore, Madcam1
inhibition may sensitize cells to Doxo in HCC treatment.
Madcam1 plays a critical role in leukocyte homing to the
mucosal immune compartment [6, 42]. Because leukocyte
homing is required for the generation and maintenance of
immune responses against pathogens, we speculate that
suppression of Madcam1 by a specific inhibitor may lead
to an impaired immune response to infection. Therefore,
a combined treatment that suppresses Madcam1 and
enhances immunity at the same time may be a better
therapeutic strategy to treat HCC.
Taken together, our study uncovers another
mechanism by which Doxo induces apoptosis in HCC
cells. We provide a strong rationale for investigating a
potential Doxo target that may increase the efficacy of
Doxo in HCC treatment. We also demonstrated a positive
auto-regulatory loop between the anti-apoptotic Madcam1
protein and PI3K/AKT signaling in the maintenance of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein homeostasis in HCC cells (Figure 7K). Thus, our
findings may provide new insights into the treatment of
HCC in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and vectors
The HCC cell lines Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 and
Hepatocyte line HL-7702 cells were cultured in DMEM.
The cells were treated with Doxorubicin (Doxo, 0.5-2.0
μg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), Actinomycin D
(10 μg/ml, Beyotime, Haimen, China), MG132 (25 μM,
Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), Wortmannin (50 μM,
Cayman) or cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml, Sigma) for
2-24 h before harvest. shRNAs against Madcam1 (sh#1
and sh#2) and AKT (sh#1 and sh#2) were purchased from
Genechem Biotech LTD (Shanghai, China). The cDNA
fragments encoding human Madcam1 were purchased
from Origene (Beijing, China) and subcloned into the
pcDNA3.1 (+) vector with a C-terminal FLAG tag or into
the pLJM-based lentiviral vector with a C-terminal Myc
tag. The AKT-Myc expression plasmid was described in
our previous study [23]. The primers used for plasmids
construction are listed in Supplementary Table.1.

Immunohistochemistry
(IHC),
immunofluorescence (IF), and western blotting
(WB)
For IHC, the human liver cancer tissue microarray
(TMA) slides were purchased from U.S. Biomax
(Rockville, MD, USA). Following deparaffinization and
rehydration of the tissue sections, antigen retrieval was
performed at 100 °C for 2 h with Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 6.0
(Beyotime). Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with
3% peroxide for 20 minutes, followed by three additional
rinses in PBS for 5 min. The sections were then blocked
in a buffer containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100
and incubated overnight in primary antibodies against
p-AKT (Abcam, Hong Kong, China, #76297) or Madcam1
(Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA, #5490). The signals
were detected with the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA, USA). The sections were scored using
a semiquantitative scale for each individual tumor tissue
on the array slide, with + for weak staining (i.e., 20-40%
of cells showing weak to intermediate intensity staining),
++ for strong staining (i.e., > or = 10% of cells showing
very intense staining or > 50% of cells showing weak to
moderately intense staining, in an appropriate subcellular
distribution), +++ very strong staining (i.e., > or =
30% of cells showing very intense staining or > 80% of
cells showing moderately intense staining). The scoring
results were simplified into the +, ++, or +++ categories.

Statistical analysis was performed using the χ2 analysis,
and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
For IF, the cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 minutes, washed with
PBS and blocking buffer (3% FBS+1% HISS+0.1%
Triton X-100), and then incubated overnight at 4°C
in primary antibodies against Madcam1 (Santa Cruz

Boston, MA, USA, #9664), LC3B (CST, #3868), COXIV
(CST, #4850), Calnexin (CST, #2679) or NUP98 (CST,
#2598). Fluorescent Alexa-Fluor-488 or -555-conjugated
secondary antibodies (life technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) were used for detection.
For WB, the proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE
gels followed by standard WB. The primary antibodies
used were: FLAG-tag (Sigma, #F3165 or CST, #2368),
Myc-tag (CST, #2278 or #2276), GAPDH (CST, #5174),

(Thr308) (Abcam, #ab76297) or AKT (Epitomics, #2957).
The human Apoptosis Antibody Array-Membrane (43
Targets) (Abcam, #ab134001) was used to detect possible
apoptosis proteins that were highly associated with
Doxo and Madcam1, and this analysis was performed
in strict accordance to the manufacturer’s instruction.
The signals were recorded on X-ray film using an HRPbased chemiluminescence analysis. The possible signaling
nodes that are involved in apoptosis were screened using
the PathScan® stress and apoptosis signaling antibody
array kit (CST, #12856) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction.

After preclearing for 1 h with 50 μl of protein A/GSepharose (Novex, Oslo, Norway), the supernatants
were incubated overnight at 4°C with 3 μg of antibodies

A/G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed five times
with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and
analyzed by WB analysis with the indicated antibodies.

RNA-Immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP)
RNA-IP was performed using a kit from Active
Motif and immunoprecipitated using an anti-eIF4E
antibody (Abcam, #ab33766) (2 μg for each reaction).
The RNA was extracted from the beads using TRIZOL
reagent (Life Technologies) and reverse-transcribed using
a Primescript II-based reverse transcriptase kit (Takara,
Dalian, China). The resulting cDNAs were amplified
using primers specific for the target mRNAs listed in
Supplementary Table. 1.

Flow cytometry
An Annexin V-FITC early apoptosis detection kit
(CST, #6592) was used to identify the apoptotic DMSOor Doxo-treated Bel-7402 cells within a cell population .
Briefly, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed
with ice-cold PBS and resuspended at 105 cells/ml with
1X Annexin V Binding Buffer. Then, 1 µl of the Annexin
V-FITC conjugate and 12.5 µl of the Propidium Iodide
(PI) solution were added to each cell suspension (96 µl)
and incubated 10 min on ice in the dark. Next, the cell
suspension was diluted to a final volume of 250 µl/assay
with ice cold 1X Annexin V Binding Buffer, and analyzed
immediately using a BD FACS Canto™II cell analyzer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

The protein ligation assay (PLA) was performed to
identify the interaction between Madcam1 and AKT using
the Duolink™ in situ red starter kit (mouse/rabbit) (Sigma,
Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, SMMC-7721 or Bel-7402
cells were seeded on glass cover slips in 24-well plates
and fixed before the start of the experiments. Then, the
cells were incubated with blocking buffer (supplied by the
manufacturer), followed by the indicated primary antibody
solution (supplied by the manufacturer), containing
rabbit anti-Myc (CST, #2278), mouse anti-FLAG (CST,

Cell proliferation was measured by an MTTbased proliferation assay, as previously described [43].
Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using the CaspaseGlo 3/7 assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously
described [43] . The primers used for qPCR were listed in
Supplementary Table.1.

#8146), rabbit anti-AKT (Epitomics, #4691) or mouse
anti-Madcam1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-365934)
antibodies, overnight at 4°C. The PLA probe solution
(supplied by the manufacturer) was then added into each
cell sample in a pre-heated humidified chamber for 1 h at
37°C before the Ligase-Ligase solution (supplied by the
manufacturer) was added into each sample for 30 min at
37°C. Finally, the glass cover slips were further incubated
with the amplification-polymerase solution (supplied
by the manufacturer) for 100 min at 37°C before being
dried at room temperature in the dark and subjected into
microscopic analysis. If the PLA probes are in close
proximity ( < 40 nm), bright fluorescent emissions can be
detected under a fluorescence microscope.
