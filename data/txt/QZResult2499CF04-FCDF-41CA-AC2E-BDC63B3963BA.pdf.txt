ABSTRACT
Sorafenib resistance remains a major obstacle for the effective treatments of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies indicate that activated Akt contributes
to the acquired resistance to sorafenib, and miR-21 dysregulates phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN), which inhibits Akt activation. Sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
were shown to be refractory to sorafenib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Akt
and its downstream factors were highly activated and/or upregulated in sorafenibresistant cells. Inhibition of autophagy decreased the sensitivity of sorafenib-resistant
cells to sorafenib, while its induction had the opposite effect. Differential screening
of miRNAs showed higher levels of miR-21 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Exposure
of HCC cells to sorafenib led to an increase in miR-21 expression, a decrease in PTEN
expression and sequential Akt activation. Transfection of miR-21 mimics in HCC cells
restored sorafenib resistance by inhibiting autophagy. Anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides
re-sensitized sorafenib-resistant cells by promoting autophagy. Inhibition of
miR-21 enhances the efficacy of sorafenib in treating sorafenib-resistant HCC tumors
in vivo. We conclude that miR-21 participates in the acquired resistance of sorafenib
by suppresing autophagy through the Akt/PTEN pathway. MiR-21 could serve as a
therapeutic target for overcoming sorafenib resistance in the treatment of HCC.

(ERK) pathway, and several tyrosine kinase receptors
[3]. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathway cross-talks with the Raf/MAPK/ERK pathway
[5], and represents a key signaling pathway activated in
hepatocarcinogenesis [6, 7]. Sorafenib activates Akt [8]
and its downstream factors such as ribosomal protein
S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) in HCC cells
[9, 10]. Blockade of the PI3K/Akt pathway increases the
sensitivity of sorafenib against HCC [9, 11, 12]. We have
recently demonstrated that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
had increased expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt),

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second
leading cause of worldwide cancer-related death in
men [1]. It is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy [2].
Sorafenib is a first-line systemic drug for advanced HCC,
but has only limited survival benefits [3, 4]. It is, therefore,
important to unravel the molecular mechanisms that
underlie sorafenib resistance in HCC.
As a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),
sorafenib inhibits the Raf/mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signaling-regulated kinase

and inhibition of Akt reversed the acquired resistance
to sorafenib [13]. However, the mechanisms by which
sorafenib activates Akt in HCC remain unclear.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs
that act by post-transcriptional silencing. They play critical
roles in regulating multiple cellular functions [14]. Among
these, miRNA-21 is one of the well characterized miRNAs
and is consistently overexpressed in various types of
malignancies including HCC [15, 16, 17]. Overexpressed
miR-21 contributes to increased cell proliferation and
a decline in apoptosis by suppressing several tumor
suppressor genes including phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN), tropomyosin 1, programmed cell death
4, maspin and metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 [15, 18]. Recent
studies reveal that miR-21 induces activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway through inhibiting PTEN [17, 19, 20, 21].
MiR-21 has also been shown to be a therapeutic target for
reversing drug resistance in several types of cancer [22].
For instance, it contributes to gefitinib resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer [23, 24], trastuzumab resistance in
breast cancer [20], and the resistance to interferon-α/5fluorouracil in HCC [25]. However, it remains unclear
whether miR-21 also mediates the acquired resistance of
HCC cells to sorafenib.
Autophagy was initially regarded as a self-digestion
process [26], but more recently it has been considered to
be the Type II programmed cell death (PCD) [27]. It is
well recognized that apoptosis is the Type I PCD and a
tumor suppressing pathway, but autophagy is a doubleedged sword depending on the cellular context and nature
of the stimuli [28]. It has been reported that sorafenib
induced autophagic death of HCC cells [29]. We have
recently reported that autophagy participates in sorafenib
resistance, and that inhibition of autophagy sensitizes HCC
cells to sorafenib [13]. The activated Akt/ mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway exerts an inhibitory
effect on autophagy by dysregulating autophagy-related
protein (ATG) 6 (also known as Beclin-1) and ATG8
(microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, LC3)
[13, 30, 31]. As a typical target gene of miR-21, PTEN
induces strong inhibition of autophagy [32]. Targeting
miR-21 confers radio-sensitivity of glioma cells [33],
and increases chemosensitivity of leukemia cells [34], by
enhancing autophagy. These results indicate that miR-21
may regulate sorafenib resistance through its effects on
autophagy.

with HepG2 and Huh cells reduced their viability in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1A). However,
HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR cells became resistant to
sorafenib as their viability was significantly higher than
that of respective parental cells when exposed to the same
concentration of sorafenib (Figure 1A). In the presence of
20 μM sorafenib, the viability of HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR
were 36.3% and 45.7%, respectively, while the parental
cells were almost completely non-viable (Figure  1A).
These results are in agreement with previous reports [13,
35, 36], and are supported by apoptosis results. Thus
sorafenib-resistant cells become refractory to sorafenibinduced apoptosis (Figure 1B).
We next examined alterations of the key molecules
in the Akt/mTOR pathway. Sorafenib-resistant cells
expressed higher levels of p-Akt, resulting in upregulation
of mTOR and differential expression of other downstream
factors, when compared with their respective parental cells
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1). Incubation of
sorafenib resulted in increased activation of Akt, leading
to the increased expression of mTOR, in both parental and
sorafenib-resistant cells (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Figure S1). These results indicate that sustained exposure
of HCC cells to sorafenib could activate the Akt/mTOR
pathway.

Inhibition of autophagy contributes to sorafenib
resistance in HCC cells
Given that mTOR is a gatekeeper of autophagy
by dysregulating ATGs [37], we next investigated
whether inhibition of autophagy contributes to the
acquired resistance to sorafenib. Incubation of sorafenib
led to more acridine orange-stained acidic vesicular
organelles (AVOs) in both parental and sorafenibresistant cells, but parental cells had more AVOs than
sorafenib-resistant cells (Figure  2A). Quantitative
analysis confirmed that the sorafenib-resistant cells had
significantly lower FL3 intensity than their parental cells
in the presence of sorafenib (Figure 2B). The results
were further supported by staining the above cells with
monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a marker for autophagic
vacuoles (Supplementary Figure S2). Immunoblotting
analysis showed that sorafenib upregulated the
expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1, two key autophagic
proteins, in both parental and sorafenib-resistant cells;
but parental cells expressed higher levels of LC3-II
and Beclin-1 than sorafenib-resistant cells (Figure 2C).
Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA)
protected sorafenib-resistant cells against sorafenibinduced reduction in cell viability. In contrast,
rapamycin (RAP), an inhibitor of mTOR and an inducer
of autophagy [38], increased sorafenib-induced growth
inhibition of sorafenib-resistant cells (Figure 2D). To
further verify the role of autophagy in sorafenib-induced
reduction  in  cell viability, we applied  a mixture of

of miR-21 by real-time RT-PCR. Exposure of either
parental or sorafenib-resistant HCC cells to the lower
concentration of sorafenib upregulated the expression of
miR-21, though sorafenib-resistant cells expressed higher
levels of miR-21 than their parental cells, in the presence
or absence of sorafenib (Figure 3A). PTEN is a known
miR-21 target gene in HCC cells [15, 17]. We confirmed
that sorafenib-resistant cells expressed lower levels of
PTEN protein, and sorafenib significantly reduced the
expression of PTEN in both parental and sorafenibresistant HCC cells (Figure 3B). However, the levels of
PTEN mRNA remained unchanged between sorafenibresistant and parental cells with or without sorafenib
incubation (Figure 3C).

We next analyzed the miRNA expression
profiles in Huh7 and Huh7-SR cells by using a Human

and 2 most downregulated miRNAs in HepG2, HepG2SR, Huh7 and Huh7-SR cells (Supplementary Figure S4).

by 53.6± 2.4% and 70.1 ± 3.3% in HepG2-SR and
Huh7-SR cells, respectively, whereas the suppressions
were only 6.5–10% in their parental cells (Figure 4B).
However, co-transfection of anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides
significantly attenuated the suppression in luciferase activity
in sorafenib-resistant cells, but did not significantly alter

that miR-21 overexpression in sorafenib-resistant HCC
cells is accompanied by the elevated targeting function of
miR-21.
We next examined whether changing miR-21 by
exogenous transfection could lead to the change of PTEN
protein expression and the activation of Akt, which is
negatively regulated by PTEN [17]. Transfection of
miR-21 mimics significantly reduced the expression
of PTEN protein and increased the activation of Akt in
parental HCC cells; whereas anti-miR-21 significantly
increased the expression of PTEN protein and inhibited
the activation of Akt in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
(Figure 4C).

sorafenib in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells (Figure 5A). These
results were supported by apoptosis assays, which showed
that transfection of miR-21 mimics reduced the pro-apoptotic
activity of sorafenib in parental HCC cells, while anti-miR-21
enhanced the pro-apoptotic activity of sorafenib in sorafenibresistant cells (Figure 5B). The results were supported by the
activation of caspase-3 examined by immunoblotting analysis
(Figure 5C).

MiR-21 affects sorafenib-induced autophagy in
HCC cells
Since autophagy participates in sorafenib
resistance in HCC cells [13], we next investigated the
effects of miR-21 on autophagy of HCC cells. MiR-21
mimics inhibited sorafenib-induced autophagy in HepG2
and Huh7 cells since fewer acridine orange-stained AVOs
were observed in miR-21 mimics-transfected
cells than in control oligonucleotides-transfected
cells  (Figure  6A). On the other hand, transfection of
anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides increased autophagy of
HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR cells induced by sorafenib since

anti-miR-21-transfected cells had more acridine
orange-stained AVOs than control oligonucleotidestransfected cells (Figure 6A). These results were in
agreement with quantitative analysis by flow cytometry
(Figure 6B). The results of acridine orange assay were
supported by the data from MDC staining (Figure 6C)
and immunoblotting data (Figure 6D). MiR-21 mimics

of miR-21 mimics into parental HCC cells rendered cells
insensitive to sorafenib-induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis by inhibiting cell autophagy. Antagonism of miR21 by specific oligonucleotides re-sensitized sorafenibresistant cells to sorafenib by promoting autophagy, and
increases the efficacy of sorafenib in treating sorafenibresistant HCC tumors established in mice.
Although it is not a direct target of sorafenib, the
PI3K/Akt pathway plays a critical role in the mechanism
of sorafenib resistance as it crosstalks with the major
sorafenib-targeted MAPK/ERK pathway [5]. It has been
previously demonstrated that sorafenib activates Akt
and blockade of the PI3K/Akt pathway increases the
efficacy of sorafenib [9–11]. Here we have again shown
that sorafenib induces the activation of Akt in HCC
cells, in accordance with our previous report [13]. Akt
upregulates mTOR expression and the phosphorylation
of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β, which regulate
apoptotic proteins S6K and 4EBP1 [12, 41]. The mTOR
also controls autophagy by regulating autophagic proteins
LC3 and Beclin-1 [37].
Sustained drug exposure can induce an imbalance
in apoptotic pathways, leading to resistance to apoptosis
[42], and enabling an autophagy switch from a protective
to a death-promoting role [13, 28, 43, 44]. Beclin-1
binds to other components to form a core complex to
allow autophagosome nucleation [45], and interacts
with apoptotic molecules [28]. It has been reported
that paclitaxel resistance is associated with a switch
from apoptotic to autophagic cell death in breast cancer
cells [44]. Crosstalks between autophagic and apoptotic
pathways offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention
[28]. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR by RAP promoted
cell autophagic death and thus augmented the effects of
sorafenib against sorafenib-resistant HCC cells as in this
study and supported by a previous report [46].
Altered expression and dysfunction of miRNAs
have been well documented in carcinogenesis and
progression of human malignancies by regulating the
expression of oncogenes and suppressor oncogenes.
MiR-21 is one of the few miRNAs that are expressed
in various types of malignances including HCC [15, 16,
17]. The recently proposed “onco-miR addition” concept
has further strengthened the central role of miR-21
in carcinogenesis [47]. MiR-21 has also been identified
as the one molecular species associated with drug
resistance [22]. Overexpressed miR-21 contributes to
the resistance of HCC cells to interferon-α/5-fluorouracil
[25], the acquired resistance of EGFR-TKI [23] and
gefitinib resistance [24] in non-small cell lung cancer
cells [23], and the acquired resistance to trastuzumab
in breast cancer [20]. Blockage of miR-21 augments
the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy against glioblastoma
[21]. In accord, we reported herein that overexpression
of miR-21 is induced in the acquired resistance to
sorafenib and inhibition of miR-21 enhances the efficacy

Inhibition of miR-21 enhances the efficacy of
sorafenib in treating sorafenib-resistant HCC
tumors in vivo
In animal studies, oral administration of sorafenib
and intratumoral injection of anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides
significantly reduced the size of Huh7-SR tumors
by 29.6% and 51.5%, respectively at day 18. The
combinational therapy resulted in a further reduction by
74.5%, compared with control tumors (Figure 7A).
Immunoblotting analysis of tumor lysates
demonstrated that sorafenib treatment resulted in
downregulation of PTEN, increased the activation of
Akt and caspase-3, and upregulated LC3-II and Beclin-1
expression (Figure 7B). Treatment of anti-miR-21 led
to upregulation of PTEN, LC3-II, Beclin-1 and cleaved
caspase-3, and reduced expression of p-Akt (Figure 7B).
There were fewer Ki-67 positive cells in tumors treated
with anti-miR-21 or sorafenib, compared with control
tumors; and the combinational therapy resulted in even
fewer Ki-67 positive cells (Figure 7C, 7D). Tumors treated
with anti-miR-21 or sorafenib had a greater number
of TUNEL-positive cell than control tumors, and the
combinational therapy resulted in even more TUNELpositive cells (Figure 7C, 7D). Electron microscopy also
revealed abundant autophagosomes in cells from tumors
treated by miR-21 inhibitor plus sorafenib, but they were
rare in vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
The discovery of sorafenib has opened a narrow
window of hope for combating HCC, but this promising
treatment has demonstrated low survival benefits, and some
HCC patients initially respond to sorafenib but eventually the
disease progresses [3]. Unfortunately, there are no alternative
effective systemic agents against HCC currently available
[39, 40]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate underlying
mechanisms for the acquired resistance to sorafenib and seek
potential strategies to increase its efficacy against HCC. In
this report, we show that up-regulation of miR-21 is induced
in the acquired resistance to sorafenib in HCC cells. This
increase is likely to contribute to the resistance by inhibiting
sorafenib-induced autophagy through downregulating PTEN
and sequential activation of the Akt pathway. Transfection

of sorafenib in the treatment of sorafenib-resistant HCC
cells.
Among the miR-21 targets, PTEN is a well
characterized tumor-suppressing phosphatase that
inhibits Akt activation. By downregulating PTEN,
miR-21 promotes the growth of HCC through the Akt
pathway [15, 17]. Our results demonstrate that PTEN
reduction due to elevated miR-21 is responsible for
sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. By rescuing PTEN
expression in sorafenib-resistant cells, anti-miR-21
oligonucleotides led to Akt inhibition. Accordingly,
antagonism of miR-21 inactivated Akt through PTEN
upregulation in HCC cells [17]. On the other hand,
transfection of miR-21 mimics inhibited the expression
of PTEN, leading to activation of AKT, and promoting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCC cell growth, in accordance with a previous report
[19]. Although it has not been investigated here, the
regulation of Bcl-2 by miR-21 may also participate in
sorafenib resistance, as ani-miR-21 was shown to increase
autophagy and chemosensitivity of leukemia cells by
upregulating Bcl-2 expression [34].
In addition, the present study has also demonstrated
that miR-21-inhibited autophagy contributes to the
resistance to sorafenib, possibly through regulating the
PTEN/Akt pathway [32]. Transfection of miR-21 mimics
inhibited autophagy, while anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides
promoted autophagy of HCC cells. Inhibition of
miR-21 enhances the efficacy of sorafenib against
sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by promoting cell autophagy.
Therfore, blockade of miR-21 increased the sensitivity

and chemosensitivity of leukemia cells [34], through
enhancing autophagy.
In summary, the results of this study demonstrate
a significant association between miR-21 expression and
the acquired resistance of sorafenib in HCC. The miR-21mediated sorafenib resistance is through its inhibitory
effects on autophagy by regulating the PTEN/Akt pathway.
Our findings suggest that miR-21 could be a potentially
therapeutic target for reversing the sorafenib resistance in
treating HCC.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription with a
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems), PCR array assays were performed by
using TagMan Human MicroRNA Array A + B cards
set v3.0 (Applied Biosystems). The 754 human mature

The expression of miRNAs was measured by the ∆∆Ct
methods. The ∆Ct was calculated by subtracting the Ct
of U6 RNA from the Ct of each miRNA of interest. The

To validate the expression levels of miRNAs
measured by microarray, several selected miRNAs
and U6 (an inner control) were further examined by
real-time PCR by using a TaqMan MiRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), individual
TaqMan MiRNA assay, and MX3000P Real-time PCR
system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, antibodies and reagents
Human HCC HepG2 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA), and Huh7 cells from Chinese Academy of
Sciences Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured
at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. The antibodies (Abs) against
Akt, p-Akt (Ser473), GSK3β, phosphorylated GSK3β
(p-GSK3β) (Ser9), mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR
(p-mTOR) (Ser2448), S6K, phosphorylated S6K (p-S6K)
(Thr389), 4EBP1, phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p-4EBP1)
(Ser65), LC3, Beclin-1 and p62 were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, USA). The Abs
against PTEN, caspase-3 and -9 and β-actin were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). The anti-Ki67
Ab was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Sorafenib
was from Jinan Trio Pharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China).
RAP, 3-MA, E-64D, pepstatin A, acridine orange and
MD) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).
Sorafenib and RAP were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) to make a stock solution of 100 mM and 1 mM
for in vitro assays, respectively. 3-MA was dissolved in
PBS at a concentration of 200 mM by heating to 60–70°C
immediately before use.

Luciferase reporter assay
To evaluate the function of miR-21, the 3’UTR of
PTEN with a miR-21 targeting sequence was cloned into a
pMIR-REPORT luciferase reporter vector (Ambion). The
assay was conducted as described previously [20]. Briefly,
the reporter vector plasmid was transfected into cells using
Lipofectamine 2000. To correct transfection efficiency,
a luciferase reporter vector without the miR-21 target
was transfected in parallel. Luciferase activities in cells
were measured by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI), and a miR-21 function was expressed as
percentage of the luciferase activity of the reporter vector
with miR-21 target sequence over one without the miR-21
sequence.

Establishment of sorafenib-resistant cells
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of HCC cells to sorafenib was initially determined
by incubating cells with different concentrations of
sorafenib in 96-well plates, and cell viability was
measured 3 days later as described below. The cells
were cultured in 6-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well and
incubated with sorafenib at a concentration just below
their respective IC50. The concentration of sorafenib was
slowly increased by 0.25 μM per week. After 6 months,
two sorafenib-resistant cell lines were obtained,
termed HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR, respectively, and
were continuously maintained by culturing them in the
presence of sorafenib.

Transfection of oligonucleotides
MiR-21 mimics (5′-AACAUCAGUCUGAUAAGC
UAUU-3′), anti-miR-21 (5′-UCAACAUCAGUCUGAUA
AGCUA-3′) and the negative control oligonucleotides
(5′-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3′) were purchased from GenePharma Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
Cells were grown to 60–70% confluence, and incubated
with RNAs at a final concentration of 0.1 μM by using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen, Beijing, China)
in a serum-free medium for 48 h and then subjected to
­assays.

the anti-miR-21 group, oral vehicle and intratumoral antimiR-21 oligonucleotides; mice in the sorafenib + antimiR-21 group, oral sorafenib and intratumoral anti-miR-21
oligonucleotides. Tumor were measured every 3 days and
harvested 18 days following treatment commencement.

Cells were incubated with acridine orange
(5 μM) at 37°C for 15 min, washed with cold PBS, and
examined by fluorescent microscopy. AVOs appeared as
orange/red fluorescent cytoplasmic vesicles, while nuclei
were stained green. Acridine orange-stained cells were
further trypsinized and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow
cytometer (BD. Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA).
The degree of autophagic lysosome was expressed as fold
change of acridine orange fluorescence intensity (FL3)
of red in treated cells versus control cells. Autophagic
vacuoles were also detected with MDC (Sigma-Aldrich)
staining. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and then
incubated with 0.05 mM MDC in PBS at 37°C for 45 min.
After incubation, the cells were washed four times with
PBS and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry, and
viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Tumor tissues were
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h, washed
twice with PBS, followed by further fixation with 1%
Osmic acid for 1 h, dehydrated with a graded series of
ethanol, embedded, and sectioned. Sections were stained
with uranium acetate and lead citrate, and observed under
a transmission electron microscope (JEN-M1220, Toshiba,
Japan) [13].

Cell proliferation analysis
The cells were seeded into a 96-well plate
(3 × 103/well) in triplicate, and cultured overnight.
The culture medium was replaced with fresh FCSfree media containing vehicle or testing reagents at
various concentrations for 24, 48 or 72 h. Cell viability
was measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) kit
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA). Untreated cells served as controls. Cell viability
(%) was calculated according to the formula: experimental
OD value/control OD value × 100%.

In vitro apoptosis assay
Cells (1 × 105) were suspended in 100μl binding
buffer, 5μl of Annexin V and 5μl of propidium iodide (PI)
were added, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature
in dark, according to the manufacturer’s instruction (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Then the cells were subjected
to flow cytometry to measure the apoptosis rate (%) with a
Beckman Coulter Epics Altra II cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
California, USA). The experiments were repeated thrice.

Animal experiments
Six to 8-week-old male nude BALB/c mice (H-2b)
were obtained from the Animal Research Center, The First
Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, China.
This study had been approved (permit SYXK20020009)
by the Animal Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical
University, in compliance with the Experimental Animal
Regulations by the National Science and Technology
Commission, China. The experimental protocol has
been described previously [13, 35, 36]. Briefly, Huh7SR cells (5 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneously into
the back of mice, which received oral administration of
15  mg/kg sorafenib every three days. The use of lower
dose of sorafenib was to maintain the sorafenib-resistant
ability of Huh7-SR cells, which were kept in the presence
of sorafenib in culture. Thirty days later (when the tumors
reached ~100 mm3), mice were assigned to four treatment
groups (n = 6 per group), namely control, sorafenib, antimiR-21, and sorafenib + anti-miR-21 groups. Sorafenib
was suspended in an oral vehicle containing Cremophor
(Sigma-Aldrich), 95% ethanol and water in a ratio of
1:1:6 [13, 35], and administrated orally at a dose of
30 mg/kg by gavage daily. Anti-miR-21 or negative control
oligonucleotides were mixed with Lipofectamine2000
(5 pmol/μl of oligonucleotides solution), and injected
intratumorally at multiple sites every 3 days. Mice in the
control group received intratumoral control oligonucleotides
and oral vehicle; mice in sorafenib group, oral sorafenib
and intratumoral control oligonucleotides; mice in

Immunoblotting analysis
Cells or tumor tissues were homogenized in protein
lysate buffer (50 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4, 100 μmol/L EDTA,
0.25mol/L sucrose, 1%SDS, 1% NP40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin,
1 μg/ml pepstatin A and 100 μmol/L phenyl methyl sulfonyl
flouride) and debris was removed by centrifugation at
10,000 × g for 10 min at 4oC. Protein concentrations were
determined (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). Lysates
were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
(SDS-PAGE) gels, electrophoretically transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membranes were blocked in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris HCl [pH 7.6], and 0.1% [v/v] Tween 20) containing
5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at 37oC for 2 h, and then
incubated overnight with primary Abs, and subsequently
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary Abs
for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. They were
developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
(BCIP)/ nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) (Tiangen Biotech
Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The density of each band was
measured using a densitometric analysis program (FR200,
Shanghai, China), and normalized to that of β-actin from
the same cells. In preliminary experiments, serial dilutions
of lysates (containing 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 80 μg protein)

and the amount of protein for each blot was determined.

Real-time RT-PCR for detecting PTEN mRNA

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The methods have been described in details
previously [37, 38]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted
from cells, and cDNA was synthesized. The reaction
mixtures for real-time RT-PCR were prepared
with the primers for PTEN mRNA (Forward:
5′-CAAGATGATGTTTGAAACTATTCCAATG-3′
and Reverse: 5′-CCTTTAGCTGGCAGACCACAA-3′)
and an internal control GAPDH mRNA (Forward: 5′CACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and Reverse:
5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′).
The
PCR products were analyzed by MX3000P Real-time
PCR systems (Stratagen, USA). Experiments were
performed in triplicate, and data were calculated by
∆∆Ct methods.

REFERENCES

Formalin fixed tumor specimens were transferred
to 70% ethanol, and subsequently paraffin-embedded and
sectioned. Tumor sections were rinsed with PBS, blocked
with 3% BSA for 2 h, and incubated with an anti-Ki-67 Ab
at 4oC overnight. They were subsequently incubated for
30 min with the appropriate secondary Ab using the UltraSensitive TMS-P kit (Zhongshan Co., Beijing, China),
and immunoreactivity developed with Sigma FAST DAB
(3, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) and CoCl2
enhancer tablets (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China).
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted,
and examined by microscopy. The Ki-67 positive cells
were counted in 10 randomly selected × 400 high-power
fields under microscopy. The Ki-67 proliferation index was
calculated according to the following formula: the number
of Ki-67 positive cells/ the total cell count × 100%.
