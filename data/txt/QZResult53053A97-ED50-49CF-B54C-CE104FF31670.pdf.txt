ABSTRACT
Gain-of-function mutations in the catalytic site of EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste
Homologue 2), is observed in about 22% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
cases. Here we show that selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 1,2 (HDAC1,2)
activity using a small molecule inhibitor causes cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in
EZH2 gain-of-function mutant (EZH2GOF) DLBCL cells. Our results show that blocking
the activity of HDAC1,2 increases global H3K27ac without causing a concomitant
global decrease in H3K27me3 levels. Our data shows that inhibition of HDAC1,2 is
sufficient to decrease H3K27me3 present at DSBs, decrease DSB repair and activate
the DNA damage response in these cells. In addition to increased H3K27me3, we
found that the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells overexpress another chemotherapy resistance
factor − B-lymphoma and BAL-associated protein (BBAP). BBAP monoubiquitinates
histone H4K91, a residue that is also subjected to acetylation. Our results show
that selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 increases H4K91ac, decreases BBAP-mediated
H4K91 monoubiquitination, impairs BBAP-dependent DSB repair and sensitizes the
refractory EZH2GOF DLBCL cells to treatment with doxorubicin, a chemotherapy agent.
Hence, selective HDAC1,2 inhibition provides a novel DNA repair mechanism-based
therapeutic approach as it can overcome both EZH2- and BBAP-mediated DSB repair
in the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells.

INTRODUCTION

consequently have a high relapse rate, making it a hardto-treat disease [1]. Translocations involving c-Myc,
BCL2 and BCL6 are frequently detected in DLBCL
patients [3, 4]. Apart from these genetic alterations,
recurrent somatic mutations in EZH2 (the H3K27
methyltransferase) have also been identified in DLBCL
[5-7]. These mutations occur in tyrosine 641 (Y641)
residue within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2, and
are found in two types of lymphomas: 21.7% of germinal

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is the most common
lymphoid malignancy, accounting for approximately 30%
of all adult lymphomas [1]. An optimal treatment for this
lymphoma is unavailable at present [2]. Additionally,
these lymphoma cells acquire chemoresistance and

center-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GC-DLBCL)
and 7.2% of follicular lymphoma (FL) [6]. Mutations in
EZH2 Y641 are gain-of-function mutations that result
in a hyperactive EZH2 catalyzing aberrantly high levels
of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) [5]. H3K27me3,
a transcriptional repression mark, is proposed to stably
repress tumor suppressor BLIMP1 expression in GCBDLBCL to contribute to lymphomagenesis [5]. GSK126,
a potent and selective inhibitor of EZH2 activity,
decreases H3K27me3 to promote cell death in DLBCL
cells, especially in the chemoresistant or refractory EZH2
gain-of-function mutant DLBCL cells [8]. A recent study
showed a correlation between increased H3K27me3 and
chemoresistance in cancer [9]. Therefore, decreasing
H3K27me3 in the refractory EZH2 gain-of-function
mutant (henceforth referred to as EZH2GOF) DLBCL cells
with a small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 activity is one
strategy to overcome the H3K27me3-mediated resistance
to chemotherapy.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors/
HDIs) are potent anticancer drugs [10]. Several broadspectrum HDIs are in various stages of clinical trials for
both solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies. Two
of these compounds (Vorinostat and Romidepsin) have
gained FDA approval for use in refractory cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma and belinostat was recently approved
for use in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. However, a FDAapproved HDI for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma is not
yet available [11, 12]. HDAC1 and HDAC2 (henceforth
referred to as HDAC1,2) belong to class Ι HDAC family
[13] and interact with the polycomb repression complex
2 (PRC2) that contains EZH2 as the catalytic subunit.
HDAC inhibition was previously shown to relieve
transcriptional repression mediated by PRC2 [14]. We
therefore asked whether the compromised viability of the
EZH2GOF DLBCL cells achieved by an EZH2 inhibitor can
also be obtained using an HDAC1,2-selective inhibitor.
In this study, we investigated the efficacy and
the mechanism of action of a HDAC1,2-selective
inhibitor (ACY-957) in EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. Using
this HDAC1,2-selective inhibitor, we show that loss of
HDAC1,2 activity increases global H3K27ac and impairs
proliferation of the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells within a short
three day treatment. Our studies show that HDAC1,2
activity are critical for the enrichment of H3K27me3 at
double-strand break (DSB) sites during DNA repair and
loss of HDAC1,2 activity impairs efficient DSB repair in
these refractory DLBCL cells. Hence, our findings show
how HDAC1,2 inhibition can overcome the high level
of repair activity mediated by the aberrantly increased
H3K27me3 as a result of a hyperactive EZH2 in the
chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. In addition to
their role at the DNA break sites, HDAC1,2 inhibition
increases H3K27ac globally and at the promoters of DNA
damage response genes, suggesting a role for HDAC1,2
in maintaining the H3K27ac-H3K27me3 balance within
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the cell. We also report that the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
overexpress BBAP, (B-lymphoma and BAL-associated
protein), an E3 ligase involved in monoubiquitination
of histone H4K91 [15], a factor that was shown to be
associated with chemoresistance previously [16-18].
Our findings show that H4K91ac is a novel target of
HDAC1,2. We report that HDAC1,2 inhibition decreases
H4K91 ubiquitination during DNA repair in response
to doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent), overcomes the
BBAP-mediated DNA repair and sensitizes the otherwise
chemoresistant or refractory EZH2GOF DLBCL cells to
doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent). Therefore, our
studies show that HDAC1,2 activity regulate H4K91
ubiquitination and H3K27me3 during DNA repair in
the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. In summary, our studies
show that a single selective inhibitor of HDAC1,2 can
overcome the DNA repair and chemoresistance mediated
by two chromatin-modifying enzymes − EZH2 (a histone
methyltransferase) and BBAP (a histone E3 ubiquitin
ligase).

RESULTS
H3K27me3 is increased in the EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells compared to other cancer cells
The Karpas-422 line was established from
the pleural effusion of a patient with chemotherapyresistant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) [19] and the
SUDHL4 line was derived from the peritoneal effusion
of a 38-year male NHL patient [20]. Karpas-422 and
SUDHL4 lines express mutant EZH2 with an amino acid
substitution in the catalytic SET domain: the Karpas-422
line contains the Y641N mutation and the SUDHL4
line expresses the Y641S mutant [21]. These changes
in EZH2 were previously shown to be gain-of-function
mutations resulting in a hyperactive enzyme [7]. We
examined whether EZH2 catalyzed H3K27 trimethylation
(H3K27me3) is augmented in Karpas-422 and SUDHL4
lines compared to other cancer cell lines. Extracts were
prepared for Western analysis from Karpas-422, SUDHL4,
NALM6 (a pre B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia line)
[22], HeLa (a cervical adenocarcinoma line) and Rosa26
(a mouse fibrosarcoma line). Protein levels of EZH2 in
Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 lines were similar to that present
in other cancer cell lines (Figure 1). However, increased
H3K27me3 levels were observed in the Karpas-422 and
SUDHL4 lines compared to NALM6, HeLa and mouse
fibrosarcoma lines (Figure 1). Therefore, the Y641N or
Y641S mutations in the EZH2 SET domain do not affect
EZH2 protein levels, but result in a hyperactive enzyme
causing aberrantly increased H3K27me3 in the EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells compared to other cancer cell lines.

ACY-957 is a novel selective small molecule
inhibitor of HDAC1 and HDAC2 enzymatic
activity

we first determined the selectivity of ACY-957 towards
HDAC1 and HDAC2 in in vitro enzyme assays using
recombinant enzymes. We also included ACY-1044, a
selective small molecule inhibitor of HDAC3, as a control
in our characterization studies. The biochemical IC50
values obtained using in vitro HDAC assays showed that
a 7.4-fold and 3.3-fold higher concentration of ACY-1044
(the HDAC3-selective inhibitor) was required to inhibit
HDAC1 and HDAC2, respectively, when compared to
HDAC3 (Figure 2A). In contrast, ACY-957 was 185fold selective for HDAC1 and 72-fold more selective for
HDAC2 when compared to HDAC3 (Figure 2A).
Next, we tested the ability of these small molecules
to inhibit HDAC1,2 or HDAC3 activities in vivo in
EZH2GOF DLBCL cell lines. We treated Karpas-422 and
SUDHL4 cells with increasing amounts of ACY-957 for
24h and examined changes in histone acetylation marks;
specifically, acetylation at histone H3 K9 and K14 residues
(H3K9,K14ac) and at histone H4 K5 residue (H4K5ac),
which are increased in Hdac1,2-/- cells [26-28]. Western
analysis showed a concentration-dependent increase
in the levels of H3K9,K14ac and H4K5ac in ACY-957
treated Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells compared to the
DMSO (vehicle) treated control cells (Figures 2B and
2C). H3K9,K14ac and H4K5ac levels are also increased
in Hdac3-/- cells [29-32] and treatment of Karpas-422 and
SUDHL4 cells with increasing concentrations of ACY1044 (the HDAC3 inhibitor) also resulted in elevated
H3K9,K14ac and H4K5ac levels compared to the DMSO
treated control cells (Supplementary Figure 1). However,
increase in H3K9,K14ac and H4K5ac levels appeared to
be more robust following inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
using ACY-957 than inhibition of HDAC3 activity using
ACY-1044 (Figures 2B, 2C and Supplementary Figure

H3K27me3 is linked to transcriptional repression
and it is enriched at the transcription start sites of inactive
genes [23]. H3K27me3 has been implicated to contribute
to the proliferation and chemoresistance in a subset of
DLBCL cells [24]. Inhibition of EZH2 activity in the GCderived DLBCL cells using a small molecule inhibitor
was previously shown to reduce global H3K27me3
levels, induce the expression of BLIMP1 (a tumor
suppressor) and impair the in vitro growth of lymphoma
cells [5]. Therefore, inhibiting the constitutively active
enzymatic function of EZH2 in order to reduce the
aberrant H3K27 hypertrimethylation is one strategy to
overcome lymphomagenesis in DLBCL cells. In addition
to methylation, the H3K27 residue also undergoes
acetylation, which is dynamically regulated by the action
of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases
(HDACs). HDAC1,2 interact with the EZH2-containing
PRC2 complex [14] and may function to remove the
acetyl group from the lysine residue in order for EZH2
catalyzed methylation to occur. Therefore, inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity alone or in combination with inhibition
of EZH2 activity could be an alternative strategy to
overcome lymphomagenesis in DLBCL cells by blocking
the gain-of-function mutant EZH2 mediated H3K27
hypertrimethylation via increased histone acetylation.
To test this possibility, we chose to inhibit HDAC1,2
activity in DLBCL cells using a novel small molecule,
ACY-957. Among class I HDACs, HDAC1,2 share a
50% sequence homology with HDAC3 [25]. Therefore,

anti-H3K27me3 and anti-EZH2 antibodies. Histone H3 served as a loading control.

1). Collectively, these results determined the minimum
concentration of ACY-957 and ACY-1044 required to
inhibit HDAC1,2 or HDAC3 activities in vivo in DLBCL
cells.
Next we set out to examine the ability of ACY-957
to inhibit only HDAC1,2 activity in DLBCL cells. We
performed a screen in Hdac1,2 or Hdac3 knockout cells
using Western blotting to identify a histone acetylation
mark that is targeted by HDAC1,2 and not HDAC3.
Western analysis of histone acetylation marks altered
in Hdac1,2-/- or Hdac3-/- fibrosarcoma cells revealed that
global H3K23ac levels are increased only upon loss of
HDAC1,2 and not in cells lacking HDAC3 (Figure 2D).
Therefore, this result identified H3K23ac as a substrate
that is specifically targeted by HDAC1,2 and not HDAC3.
Hence, we used changes in H3K23ac as a readout to test
the ability of ACY-957 to specifically inhibit HDAC1,2
activity in DLBCL cells. We treated the refractory DLBCL
cells, Karpas-422 and SUDHL4, with 2µM ACY-957,
2µM ACY-1044 (the HDAC3 inhibitor) or 2µM Vorinostat
(SAHA, a pan HDAC inhibitor that targets HDAC1,2
and HDAC3). Western analysis showed that ACY-957
treatment of DLBCL cells increased H3K23ac levels
(Figure 2E). Moreover, increase in H3K23ac obtained
using ACY-957 treatment was similar to that obtained
following treatment with SAHA (Figure 2E), suggesting
that HDAC1,2 are the primary class I HDACs involved
in deacetylating H3K23ac. Importantly, addition of ACY957, but not ACY-1044, to Karpas-422 or SUDHL4 cells
resulted in an increase in H3K23ac levels compared to the
DMSO treated control cells (Figure 2F). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that ACY-957 specifically
inhibits HDAC1,2 activity in DLBCL cells.

chromatin-associated EZH2 levels [33]. Therefore, we
also treated Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells with an
EZH2 inhibitor (DZNep or GSK126), either alone or in
combination with ACY-957, for the indicated time prior
to cell cycle analysis.
Compared to treatment with ACY-957 for 24h or
48h, treatment of Karpas-422 cells with ACY-957 for 72h
resulted in a larger increase in the number of sub-G1/dead
cells, and treatment of SUDHL4 cells with ACY-957 for
72h resulted in a greater number of cells arrested in G1
phase and those present in the sub-G1 population (Figures
3A, 3B). Treatment with DZNep alone triggered a modest
increase in dead/sub-G1 SUDHL4 cells, but resulted in
a larger increase in the number of dead Karpas-422 cells
similar to that obtained with ACY-957 treatment (Figure
3A, 3B). Combined addition of both DZNep and ACY957 caused an enhanced cytotoxic effect with a significant
increase in the number of sub-G1 or dead Karpas-422
cells, which is greater than that obtained when these cells
were treated with either DZNep alone or ACY-957 alone
(Figure 3B). Combined addition of DZNep and ACY957 to SUDHL4 cells also elicited a similar enhanced
cytotoxic effect, albeit a more modest increase in the
number dead or sub-G1 cells that is slightly larger than
that obtained with ACY-957 or DZNep alone was observed
(Figure 3B). Addition of GSK126 alone did not result in
any defect in the cell cycle progression and/or survival of
Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells even after an incubation
period of 72h (Figure 3). This result agrees well with
the reported finding that GSK126 decreases the viability
of Karpas-422 cells only after treatment for 7 days [8].
Since, we see a significant cell death with ACY-957 by
72h, we could not test the synergistic effect of ACY-957
and GSK-126 following a 7-day treatment. Treatment of
Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells for 24h with the HDAC1,2
selective inhibitor (ACY-957) alone or the EZH2 inhibitor
alone (DZNep or GSK126) or their combined addition
(DZNep+ACY-957 or GSK126+ACY-957) did not affect
their progression through the cell cycle, as the profiles for
the inhibitor-treated cells looked similar to that obtained
for the DMSO-treated control cells (Supplementary
Figure 2). Following 48h incubation, ACY-957 treatment
resulted in the accumulation of SUDHL4 cells in G1
phase (G1 arrest) (Supplementary Figure 2A) and a
modest accumulation of sub-G1 population (indicative of
dead cells) was observed in ACY-957-treated Karpas-422
cells when compared to the control DMSO-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure 2B). Inhibition of EZH2 activity
using GSK126 alone did not cause any change in the
progression of Karpas-422 or SUDHL4 cells through the
cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggest
that selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity causes a
more rapid adverse effect on the proliferation and survival
of the chemoresistant DLBCL cells than the selective
inhibition of EZH2 activity. Treatment with the EZH2
inhibitor DZNep for 48h caused a modest increase in the

Selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity causes
cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells:
Having established that ACY-957 is a selective
inhibitor of HDAC1,2, we next asked whether HDAC1,2
activity are required for the proliferation and/or survival
of the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. Therefore, we treated
Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells with ACY-957 for 24h,
48h and 72h, and performed cell cycle analysis to measure
the extent of cell death (cytotoxic) and/or cell cycle arrest
(cytostatic) triggered as a result of inhibiting HDAC1,2
activity in these cells. Since these DLBCL cells express
a hyperactive form of EZH2, pharmacological inhibition
of EZH2 activity is considered a viable therapeutic
strategy. Indeed, several small molecule inhibitors of
EZH2 activity with varying modes-of-action are available:
GSK126 is a S-adenosyl-methionine-competitive inhibitor
of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, and DZNep is a
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor that disrupts
the components of the PRC2 complex causing reduced

number of dead Karpas-422 cells similar to that observed
with the ACY-957 treatment (Supplementary Figure 2B).
However, DZNep when combined with ACY-957 resulted
in a significant/substantial increase in the number of
sub-G1 or dead Karpas-422 cells (Supplementary Figure
2). No such synergistic effect was observed when ACY957 was combined with GSK126. These findings together
suggest that inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity along with
the dissociation of the PRC2 complex using DZNep, but
not inhibition of EZH2 activity using GSK126, causes a
synergistic cytotoxic effect on Karpas-422 cells. FACS
analysis following bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-propidium
iodide labeling and staining was performed at 48h and 72h
following treatment of cells with ACY-957. A decrease
in S-phase population accompanied by either increased
cell death or a G1 arrest was observed in Karpas-422 and
SUDHL4 cells, respectively (Figure 3C). Collectively,
results from our analysis of the chemoresistant DLBCL
cells showed that HDAC1,2 activity and an intact PRC2
complex are required for progression through the cell
cycle and/or survival.

global H3K27me3 levels as expected, a greater reduction
in H3K27me3 levels due to combined action of GSK126
and ACY-957 was not observed (Figure 4). In fact, a slight
increase in H3K27me3 levels was observed when cells
were treated with both GSK126 and ACY-957 (Figure
4). These results suggest that addition of acetyl groups
onto unmodified H3K27 residues occurs on chromatin
without requiring the removal of existing H3K27me3.
GSK126 treatment caused a significant reduction in global
H3K27me3 (Figure 4), but it did not trigger death in the
chemoresistant DLBCL by 72h, except in the case of
combination with ACY-957 in Karpas-422 cells (Figure
3). In contrast, inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity using ACY957 and/or reducing chromatin-bound EZH2 using DZNep
compromised the viability of the chemoresistant DLBCL
without reducing global H3K27me3 levels (Figures 3, 4).
Treatment of SUDHL4 or Karpas-422 cells with a
low 0.5µM DZNep decreases global EZH2 protein levels,
but it does not decrease global H3K27me3 levels (Figure
4). We have found that only a high 10µM dose of DZNep
decreases both global EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels in
Karpas-422 cells (data not shown). Our observation that

H3K27ac is robustly increased in the EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells upon selective inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity
The histone H3K27 residue is subjected to reversible
acetylation and methylation. The aberrantly increased
H3K27me3 resulting from a hyperactive EZH2 in DLBCL
cells is proposed to contribute to both lymphomagenesis
and chemoresistance. Hence, we next asked whether the
cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of ACY-957 or DZNep
on the chemoresistant DLBCL cells correlate with any
change in the dynamics of acetylation and methylation at
the H3K27 residue on chromatin. Therefore, we treated
the refractory DLBCL cells, Karpas-422 and SUDHL4,
with DMSO (vehicle), the HDAC1,2 selective inhibitor
alone (ACY-957), the EZH2 inhibitor alone (DZNep) or a
combination of both these inhibitors (ACY-957+DZNep).
We also treated cells with the second EZH2 inhibitor,
GSK126 alone, or combined with ACY-957 (ACY957+GSK126). As an additional control, cells were
treated with ACY-1044 (the HDAC3 selective inhibitor)
alone or combined with one of the two EZH2 inhibitors
(ACY-1044+DZNep or ACY-1044+GSK126). Cells were
treated for 48h prior to preparing chromatin extracts for
Western analysis using antibodies recognizing H3K27ac
or H3K27me3. As shown in Figure 4, selective inhibition
of HDAC1,2 activity alone using ACY-957 or when
combined with EZH2 inhibitors led to a robust increase in
global H3K27ac levels in both Karpas-422 and SUDHL4
cells. Surprisingly, global H3K27me3 levels were not
reduced and remained unchanged in ACY-957 treated
cells compared to the DMSO treated control cells (Figure
4). While treatment with GSK126 led to a decrease in

a low dose of DZNep reduces EZH2 protein level without
decreasing global H3K27me3 levels is consistent with
the findings from several independent studies. Low dose
DZNep treatment did not affect bulk H3K27me3 levels
in multiple myeloma and lung cancer cell lines [34,
35]. Additionally, 0.2-1µM DZNep treatment of K562
erythroid cells for 72h reduced cell viability, but global
level of H3K27me3 remained unaffected even though
Western blotting showed reduced EZH2 levels [36].
However, in this study, it was shown that DZNep treatment
decreases H3K27me3 at select loci, such as, SLC4A1
and EPB42, which are targets of the ETO2 co-repressor.
Based on all these studies, we can surmise that the bulk
H3K27me3 levels appears to be relatively stable, and not
subjected to dynamic regulation. However, at select loci,
active H3K27me3 catalyzed by EZH2, either because of
demethylation or independent of demethylation, might
be required to regulate nuclear processes, such as, gene
transcription. It is conceivable that these loci are therefore
in particular sensitive to low DZNep treatment, which is
sufficient to promote the degradation of EZH2-containing
PRC2 complex. Absence of EZH2 thus leads to the loss of
active H3K27me3 at these loci, which could include genes
controlling cell viability. Overall, our results together
suggest that the viability and/or cell cycle progression of
the refractory DLBCL cells is dependent on HDAC1,2
activity and an intact EZH2 containing PRC2 complex but
not on global H3K27me3. This is consistent with elegant
previous studies in which DZNep caused depletion of
PRC2 complex proteins in AML cells [37].

targets of EZH2, we compared our gene set with GSK126 treated Karpas-422 RNA-seq dataset reported by
Bradley et al. (2014) [38]. In this published work, target
genes of EZH2 were identified by determining changes
in the expression following treatment of Karpas-422
cells with GSK-126. This comparison yielded a list of
71 genes that were commonly up regulated in both the
datasets (Supplementary Figure 3A). A similar comparison
yielded 6 targets that were common in the list of genes
down regulated following inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
or upon inhibition of EZH2 (Supplementary Figure 3A).
Classification of the common set of 71 genes that were
up regulated in ACY-957 treated samples and the known
EZH2 target genes based on their cellular functions
revealed that they belong to pathways, such as, signaling
and are not related to apoptosis, DNA repair, DNA damage
response and cell cycle regulation (Supplementary Figure
3B). Inhibition of EZH2 activity is proposed to inhibit
tumor growth in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma via inducing
the expression of BLIMP1 (a tumor suppressor) [8].
However, DESeq analysis of our RNA-seq data showed
that BLIMP1 expression was modestly up regulated
following selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 (1.7-fold).
GSK-126 treatment of Karpas-422 cells led to a 2.4-fold
increase in Karpas-422 cells [38]. However, we saw robust
cell death with ACY-957 when compared to GSK-126
even when a high concentration of 2µM GSK-126 was
used on these cells (data not shown). Hence, up regulation
of BLIMP1 alone is unlikely to be the major cause of cell
death in the chemoresistant Karpas-422 cells upon ACY957 treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that
inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity impinges on the viability
and cell cycle progression of refractory DLBCL cells
likely by affecting processes other than EZH2 regulated
gene expression.
When cells sense endogenous DNA damage, BMF
(BCL2-modifying factor, a pro-apoptotic gene) promotes
apoptosis by binding to the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein
[39]. SAHA, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, was previously
shown to induce tumor cell selective expression of
the BMF gene [40]. We found that BMF expression
is increased by 2.5-fold upon selective inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity (Supplementary Figure 3C). Additional
search for genes related to the DNA damage response
up regulated following inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
revealed a 2-fold increase in the expression of TP63
(tumor protein 63), a p53 family member (Supplementary
Figure 3C). TP63 is required for p53-dependent
apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) following
endogenous DNA damage [41]. To gain insight into the
mechanism of transcriptional activation at the TP63 and
BMF genes following inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity,
we examined whether changes, if any, occur in the levels
of H3K27ac (an activating mark) and H3K27me3 (a
repressive mark) at the regulatory promoter regions of
these genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 induces the
expression of DNA damage response genes in
EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
While selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
does not reduce global H3K27me3 in the EZH2GOF cells
(Figure 4), it is conceivable that the cell cycle arrest and/
or death triggered in these cells by HDAC1,2 inhibition
might be due to increased H3K27ac with a concomitant
decrease in H3K27me3 locally at select target loci, such
as, genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair or
DNA damage signaling and apoptosis, which could also be
the targets of EZH2. To test this possibility, we examined
changes in gene expression in Karpas-422 cells following
ACY-957 treatment. Three independent DMSO or ACY957 treatments of Karpas-422 cells for 24h was performed
for total RNA isolation, which was then subjected to
RNA-seq involving next-generation sequencing and
bioinformatics analysis. Our RNA-seq analysis showed
that expression of 492 genes was up regulated following
inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity in Karpas-422 cells
compared to the DMSO control (Supplementary Figure
3A). In order to determine whether genes up regulated
following inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity are also

assay. Real-time PCR analysis of ChIP DNA showed an
increase in H3K27ac levels at the promoter regions of
both TP63 and BMF genes following ACY-957 treatment
(Supplementary Figure 3D). However, a concomitant
decrease in H3K27me3 was not observed at the TP63 and
BMF promoters (Supplementary Figure 3D). To determine
whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 play a direct role at these
genes and regulate H3K27ac at their promoter regions,
we performed ChIP analysis with HDAC1 and HDAC2
antibodies. We found a significant enrichment in HDAC1
and HDAC2 occupancies at the BMF and Tp63 promoters
(Supplementary Figure 3E). These results suggest
that HDAC1,2 inhibition triggers death and cell cycle
defects in the refractory DLBCL cells without requiring
a reduction in the repressive H3K27me3 at the target
genes. Overall, data from our gene expression analyses
allude to a possibility that the death and/or cell cycle
arrest in chemoresistant/refractory DLBCL cells triggered
by selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity is from the
activation of DNA damage response potentially resulting
from endogenous DNA breaks.

either of the EZH2 inhibitors. Similar to that observed
using immunofluorescence, ACY-957 treatment led to
an increase in γH2AX compared to the control DMSO
treatment in both SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells (Figure
5B). Between the two EZH2 inhibitors, DZNep treatment
caused a greater increase in γH2AX levels compared to
GSK126 (Figure 5B), consistent with the observations
using immunofluorescence (Figure 5A). These results
suggest that both HDAC1,2 and EZH2 activities are
required to prevent the accumulation of endogenous DNA
damage.
Increase in γH2AX and persistent endogenous DNA
damage might occur as a consequence of impaired DNA
repair. Therefore, to measure the efficiency of DNA repair,
we examined γH2AX levels on chromatin after a recovery
period when DNA repair occurs following exposure to an
exogenous DNA damaging agent. The EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells, SUDHL4 and Karpas-422, were treated with
DMSO or ACY-957 for 48h prior to exposure to ionizing
radiation (IR). Chromatin extracts were prepared from
these cells following a 30 min recovery after exposure to
IR and analyzed by Western blotting. γH2AX levels on
chromatin in the ACY-957-treated cells post-recovery
from IR were more than those present on chromatin in the
control DMSO-treated cells post-recovery from IR and in
the control cells treated with either DMSO or ACY-957
without any exposure to IR (Figure 5C). These results
indicate that HDAC1,2 activity is required for efficient
DNA repair and that inhibition results in the persistence
of DNA breaks. Collectively, our results suggest that
selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 in the EZH2GOF DLBCL
impairs DNA repair and activates the DNA damage
response.

Selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity increases
DNA damage and impairs DNA repair in the
EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
Next, we tested whether selective inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity in EZH2GOF DLBCL cells causes
endogenous DNA breaks. Serine 139 of H2AX is
phosphorylated (γH2AX) in response to DNA breaks and
it accumulates on chromatin over many megabases around
a break site to form the nuclear foci [42]. γH2AX foci
formation is considered a marker of DNA damage and
is used to measure the production of DNA damage and
the subsequent repair of the DNA lesion. We measured
γH2AX foci formation using immunofluorescence in
SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells, following a 24h or
48h treatment with DMSO or ACY-957. DZNep and
GSK126, the EZH2 inhibitors, were also included in
this analysis for comparison. Following a 24h treatment,
no significant increase in DNA damage was observed
in EZH2GOF DLBCL cells treated with the HDAC1,2
selective inhibitor or the EZH2 inhibitors (data not
shown), which agrees well with the lack of any defects in
the cell cycle progression observed at this time point using
these inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 2). A significant
increase in the number of cells with greater than six
γH2AX foci was observed upon ACY-957 or DZNep
treatment of SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells for 48h
(Figure 5A). GSK126 treatment caused a slight increase in
γH2AX foci at this time point (Figure 5A). We confirmed
our results from immunofluorescence by examining
changes in γH2AX levels using Western analysis of
acid extracted samples prepared following treatment
of SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells with ACY-957 or

HDAC1,2 activity are required for the enrichment
of H3K27me3 at the break sites during DNA
repair in EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
We next set out to gain insights into mechanism by
which selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity impairs
DNA repair in the chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells. As shown in Figure 5, both HDAC1,2 and EZH2
activities are crucial for the repair of DNA breaks. EZH2
and H3K27me3 also localize to the sites of DNA damage
and are suggested to play a role in the repair of double
strand DNA breaks [43]. HDAC1 and HDAC2 localize
to DNA break sites in Karpas-422 cells (Figure 5D), as
evidenced in other cell types [44]. Therefore, we asked
whether inhibiting HDAC1,2 activity impairs DNA repair
in the refractory DLBCL cells by altering the acetylationmethylation dynamic at the H3K27 residue on chromatin.
We first examined whether inhibiting HDAC1,2 activity
induces any change in global H3K27ac or H3K27me3 on
chromatin following DNA damage and during DNA repair.

ionizing radiation (IR) were initially treated with DMSO
or ACY-957 for 48h. Chromatin extracts were prepared
from these cells following a 30 min recovery period (the
repair phase) and changes in histone modifications were
examined by Western blotting. Global H3K27ac levels
on chromatin were increased in ACY-957 treated DLBCL
cells compared to the control DMSO treated cells with
or without exposure to IR (Supplementary Figure 4A).
However, a concomitant decrease in global H3K27me3
levels on chromatin was not observed following the 30
min recovery period from IR in the ACY-957 treated cells
compared to the DMSO treatment (Supplementary Figure
4A). These results suggest that HDAC1,2 actively remove
H3K27ac on chromatin during DNA repair without
affecting global H3K27me3 levels.
Active recruitment of EZH2 and the subsequent
active methylation of H3K27 occur during the repair
process following DNA damage, as EZH2 and H3K27me3
are enriched at laser induced DNA break sites [43]. Hence,
we next asked whether selective inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity impairs DNA repair in the EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells by affecting H3K27me3 that occurs locally at DNA
break sites during repair. To address this question, we first
optimized conditions to induce DNA breaks using a laser in
DLBCL cells, which are smaller in size and in suspension
compared to other cell types, such as U2OS or HeLa, that
are adherent and typically used in the laser induced break
assay. We have determined the optimal laser energy to be
applied, the optimum recovery time needed to detect the
recruitment of repair proteins or occurrence of histone
modification at laser induced break sites in DLBCL cells
and the conditions that promote the adherence of DLBCL
cells onto the chamber slide (see the Methods section for
details). Using the optimized assay, we have detected for
the first time both γH2AX and H3K27me3 at laser-induced
DNA break sites in Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 (Figure
6, see panels labeled DMSO). Elledge and colleagues
showed that H3K27me3 is enriched at laser-induced break
sites in HeLa cells [43], but Campbell et al reported that
H3K27me3 is absent at laser-induced break sites [45]. The
discrepancy between these two studies is likely to due to
the difference in the time of recovery that was used prior
to detecting H3K27me3. We find H3K27me3 is enriched
at laser induced break sites in DLBCL cells following a 15
min recovery period following exposure to laser (Figure
6), which is consistent with the finding of Elledge and
colleagues. Additionally, H3K27me3 was not enriched at
laser induced break sites in DLBCL cells after a 5 min
recovery, as used by Campbell et al (data not shown).
ACY-957 treatment dramatically reduced the
extent of H3K27me3 present at laser-induced break sites
when compared to that present at the break sites in the
DMSO treated control cells (Figure 6). To confirm these
results, we performed the laser-break assay in three
different EZH2GOF cell lines (Karpas-422, SUDHL4 and
WSU-DLCL2) (Figure 6A, 6B and 6C). WSU-DLCL2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has an Y641F mutation in the SET domain [46]. We
also confirmed this finding in an independent cell line
(HeLa) that is routinely used in studies investigating DNA
repair dynamics (Figure 6D). Similar to that observed
in the refractory DLBCL cells, decreased H3K27me3
was observed at laser induced break sites in HeLa cells
following ACY-957 treatment (Figure 6D). These results
suggest that HDAC1,2 activity is required for EZH2mediated H3K27me3 to occur at break sites during DNA
repair. Given the enrichment of H3K27me3 along with
γH2AX at the laser-induced breaks (which appear as a
stripe within the nucleus, see Figure 6), we then examined
whether H3K27ac forms ‘anti-stripe’ and is excluded from
the laser-induced break sites. A pan-nuclear staining for
H3K27ac was observed in DMSO treated control cells,
which was increased following inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity using ACY-957 (Supplementary Figures 4B, 4C).
H3K27ac was neither enriched at nor excluded from laserinduced break sites in DMSO or ACY-957 treated cells
(Supplementary Figures 4B, 4C). These results suggest
that HDAC1,2 do not remove all the H3K27ac marks at
break sites; but they might target a fraction of H3K27ac
(either specifically or stochastically) in order for the
enrichment of H3K27me3 catalyzed by EZH2 to occur at
the break sites during DNA repair. Overall, our findings
suggest that selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
impairs DNA repair in the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells in part
by blocking EZH2-mediated H3K27me3.

Chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL cells expressing
hyperactive EZH2 also overexpress the E3 ligase
BBAP
GSK126 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor
of EZH2 activity, and it targets the catalytic SET domain.
GSK126 treatment of SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells leads
to a significant decrease in H3K27me3 following 48h
treatment of cells with this EZH2 inhibitor (Figure 4), but
viability or cell cycle progression of these chemoresistant
DLBCL cells is not compromised at this time point or
even after 72h post-incubation with GSK126 (Figure 3).
These results suggest that a decrease in H3K27me3 alone
is not sufficient to trigger death and/or cell cycle arrest
in the refractory DLBCL cells in a short time frame. A
prolonged 7-day incubation with GSK126 is required to
decrease the viability of Karpas-422 cells [8]. EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells appear to be more sensitive to selective
inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity than inhibition of EZH2
activity, because we observed death and/or cell cycle
arrest in SUDHL4 and Karpas-422 cells as early as 48h or
72h following treatment with ACY-957 (Supplementary
Figure 2 and Figure 3). These findings together suggest
that in addition to H3K27me3, inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity adversely affects other factors that are required
for proliferation/survival and/or chemoresistance in these

Selective HDAC1,2 inhibition increases H4K91ac
and decreases the DNA damage induced, BBAPmediated ubiquitination of H4K91 in the EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells

refractory DLBCL cells.
A genetically diverse set of DLBCL cell lines
was recently classified as either sensitive or resistant
to chemotherapy based on responsiveness to CHOP
chemotherapy regimen, which includes doxorubicin
[47]. Karpas-422 is a chemoresistant DLBCL cell line
and SUDHL4 DLBCL cell line is partially resistant to
chemotherapy drugs when compared to the sensitive
SUDHL8 DLBCL cell line [47]. Deltex (DTX)-3-like E3
ubiquitin ligase (DTX3L), also known as B-lymphoma and
BAL-associated protein (BBAP), is overexpressed in high
risk, chemotherapy-resistant aggressive forms of DLBCL
[16]. BBAP is required for the monoubiquitination of
histone H4K91 (H4K91ub1) and has been proposed to
protect cells from death when exposed to DNA-damaging
agents [17, 18]. Hence, we postulated that BBAP and
H4K91ub1 might also contribute to the chemoresistance
and/or survival of the DLBCL cells. We therefore tested
whether chemoresistant EZH2GOF cells also express
higher levels of BBAP compared to the chemosensitive
DLBCL cells. Western blotting was performed to detect
BBAP levels using extracts prepared from EZH2GOF
lines (Karpas-422, SUDHL4), a chemosensitive EZH2
wild-type DLBCL line (SUDHL8), NALM6 (a pre-B
ALL line), HeLa (a cervix adenocarcinoma line), mouse
NIH3T3 cells and mouse fibrosarcoma cells. Additionally,
extracts from HeLa cells transfected with either a nontargeting siRNA (siNT) or one of the two siRNAs
targeting the BBAP transcript were included as controls.
Our results showed that BBAP levels are higher in the
chemoresistant Karpas-422 when compared to SUDHL4
cells and the chemosensitive SUDHL8 cells (Figure 7A).
Amongst the EZH2GOF DLBCL lines, Karpas-422 is more
chemoresistant than SUDHL4; BBAP levels were higher
in the former than the latter (Figure 7A). Additionally,
BBAP levels were high in the chemoresistant NALM6
cells (Figure 7A). These results together show a correlation
between chemoresistance and elevated BBAP levels.
Refractory DLBCL cells contain a hyperactive EZH2, and
EZH2 is important for DNA repair (Figures 5 and 6), but
inhibition of EZH2 activity alone is not sufficient to cause
cytotoxicity in these cells (Figure 3). BBAP is required
for the efficient repair of double strand DNA breaks, and
BBAP-mediated H4K91ub1 is increased upon exposure
of cells to doxorubicin (a DNA-damaging chemotherapy
drug) [17]. It is conceivable that increased BBAP levels
in the refractory DLBCL cells might promote repair of
the DNA damage induced by chemotherapy drugs, likely
via increased H4K91ub1, to confer chemoresistance and
support the proliferation/survival of these cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The H4K91 residue is implicated in DNA repair in
yeast and mammalian cells. H4K91 undergoes chemically
exclusive modifications, acetylation and ubiquitination, in
mammalian cells [17]. Therefore, we hypothesized that
selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity might increase
H4K91ac to block BBAP-mediated H4K91ub1 and
impair DNA repair in the chemoresistant DLBCL cells.
To test this possibility, we performed acid extraction of
nuclei isolated from either DMSO or ACY-957 treated
Karpas-422 and SUDHL4 cells to obtain histonesenriched fractions. We used the acid extraction procedure
to not only enrich for the highly basic histone proteins, but
to also prevent the loss of histone ubiquitination, which
is a labile modification that is removed by the action of
deubiquitinases within the cell. Western analysis of acidextracted histones showed that inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity increased global H4K91ac levels in both SUDHL4
and Karpas-422 cells (Figure 7B), and therefore, revealed
that H4K91ac is a novel target of HDAC1,2. Additionally,
ACY-957 treatment also increased global levels of
H4K16ac (Figure 7B), which we previously showed
is a target of HDAC1,2 [28]. H4K16ac occurs at the
N-terminal tail region and is known to disrupt chromatin
packaging by preventing inter-nucleosomal interactions
[48]. On the other hand, the H4K91 residue is present at
the interface between the H3-H4 tetramer core and the
H2A-H2B dimer within the nucleosome, and acetylation
at this residue is proposed to weaken nucleosome stability
by preventing the salt bridge formation and adversely
affect chromatin assembly, as reported in yeast [49-51].
Therefore, our results together suggest that HDAC1,2 may
play a role in nucleosome and chromatin dynamics in the
chemoresistant DLBCL cells.
We next examined whether global H4K91ub1 is
impacted upon selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
in DLBCL cells. Covalent addition of a bulky 7.6-kDa
ubiquitin moiety onto the H4K91 residue retards gel
migration resulting in slower migrating species of H4. We
treated HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid to express a
Flag-Myc epitope-tagged H4 or Flag-Myc epitope-tagged
H4 mutant harboring a lysine to arginine substitution
at position 91 (H4K91R) with doxorubicin. As shown
in Figure 7C, H4K91ub1 induced by doxorubicin is
significantly reduced by H4K91R mutation. An antibody
recognizing H4K91ub1 is not available. We therefore
used an anti-histone H4 antibody in the Western analysis
of acid-extracted histones obtained from SUDHL4 or
Karpas-422 cells treated for 30h (Figure 7D) or 48h
(data not shown) with DMSO or ACY-957, which
showed no change in global levels of the slow migrating

monoubiquitinated form of H4. This result suggested that
inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity does not affect preexisting
H4K91ub1 marks. H4K91ub1 levels are increased when
cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents, such as,
doxorubicin [17]. Given the increase in global H4K91ac
with ACY-957 treatment (Figure 7B), we next asked
whether active monoubiquitination of H4K91 catalyzed
by BBAP is regulated by HDAC1,2 activity. We treated
Karpas-422 or SUDHL4 cells with DMSO or ACY-957 for
48h prior to the incubation for 4h or 8h in the presence of

doxorubicin. Western analysis of acid-extracted histones
showed a significant reduction to complete absence of the
slow migrating monoubiquitinated form of H4 in ACY957-treated Karpas-422 or SUDHL4 cells, respectively
(Figure 7E). Collectively, these results showed that
HDAC1,2 activity are required for BBAP-catalyzed active
H4K91ub1 to occur when DLBCL cells are exposed to
doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug and a DNA-damaging
agent.

Selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity
delays the kinetics of BBAP-dependent 53BP1
recruitment to chemo-induced DNA break sites

response and increased number of γH2AX-containing
double-strand breaks. However, the repair of these breaks
is impaired in the absence of HDAC1,2 activity as the
majority of γH2AX-containing break sites do not also
contain 53BP1 repair protein.

Knockdown of BBAP delayed the accumulation of
53BP1 (a key repair protein) at DNA breaks induced by
doxorubicin, suggesting that BBAP, via H4K91ub1, might
protect DLBCL cells from DNA damage by facilitating
53BP1-mediated repair of double-strand DNA breaks
[17]. Active BBAP-mediated H4K91ub1 induced by
doxorubicin is inhibited when cells are pretreated with
ACY-957 (Figure 7). Therefore, we hypothesized that
selective inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity might impair
DNA repair in chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL cells by
delaying the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA break sites as
a result of increased H4K91ac and decreased H4K91ub1.
To test this possibility, we treated DLBCL cells
with DMSO or ACY-957 for 24h prior to a low dose of
doxorubicin (50nM) treatment. We examined γH2AX
and 53BP1 foci formation at 4h or 8h post-doxorubicin
treatment using immunofluorescence. We chose a 24h
ACY-957 treatment for this assay as we did not detect any
significant accumulation of endogenous DNA damage
resulting from inhibiting HDAC1,2 activity using this
treatment time (data not shown), unlike that observed
when cells were treated with ACY-957 for 48h (Figure 5).
Thus, this short duration of inhibitor treatment enabled us
to bypass the DNA repair events triggered by endogenous
DNA damage in the absence of HDAC1,2 activity and
directly follow the kinetics of doxorubicin-mediated DNA
repair upon inhibiting HDAC1,2. Immunofluorescence
showed co-localization of 53BP1 with γH2AX at 4h
and 8h following addition of doxorubicin to the control
DMSO-treated Karpas-422 cells (Figure 8).
The percentage of cells containing 0, 1-5, 6-10 and
greater than 10 γH2AX and 53BP1 foci were determined
in at least 100 cells from four independent experiments.
Quantitation of percentage of cells with 53BP1 foci colocalizing with γH2AX foci revealed a decrease in the
number of 53BP1 foci in ACY-957-treated Karpas-422
cells at 4h post-doxorubicin treatment when compared
to DMSO-treated controls (Figure 8). Following an 8h
treatment with doxorubicin, the percentage of cells with
1-5, 6-10, and greater than 10 53BP1 foci in ACY-957treated cells increased to the level that was observed in
the control DMSO-treated cells. However, ACY-957treated cells had an even higher percentage of cells
with 6-10 and greater than 10 γH2AX foci compared to
DMSO-treated control cells at this 8h time point (Figure
8). These results together suggest that HDAC1,2 activity
are required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA
break sites following exposure to doxorubicin. Our results
also suggest that pretreatment of EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
with HDAC1,2-selective inhibitor sensitizes cells to
doxorubicin which results in increased DNA damage

Treatment with HDAC1,2 selective inhibitor
sensitizes the EZH2GOF refractory DLBCL cells to
doxorubicin
BBAP knockdown sensitizes HeLa cells to
doxorubicin-induced cell death [18] and inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity decreased H4 monoubiquitination and
53BP1 recruitment during doxorubicin-induced DSB
repair (Figures 7 and 8). Hence, we examined whether
HDAC1,2 inhibition could sensitize the chemorefractory
EZH2GOF Karpas-422 cells to doxorubicin treatment
and overcome drug resistance. In order to test this
possibility, we performed cell cycle analysis following
treatment of Karpas-422 with ACY-957, doxorubicin or
ACY-957 in combination with doxorubicin. Karpas-422
cells showed a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in the percentage
of cells in G2/M phase with a modest increase in cell
death upon doxorubicin treatment (Figures 9A, 9B).
Additionally, a sub-G1 population (i.e., dead cells) was
observed following ACY-957 treatment of Karpas-422
cells (Figures 9A, 9B). However, combined treatment of
Karpas-422 cells with doxorubicin and ACY-957 resulted
in an increased sensitivity of cells to death, as the sub-G1
population increased by ~5-fold when compared to DMSO
control (Figures 9A, 9B). BrdU-PI analysis also showed a
consistent increase in sub-G1 population upon combined
application of ACY-957 and doxorubicin to Karpas-422
cells (Figure 9C). Our results therefore suggest that
HDAC1,2 inhibition can overcome doxorubicin-resistance
in the refractory EZH2GOF Karpas-422 cells by impairing
BBAP-mediated DSB repair via H4K91ub1 in addition to
EZH2-mediated DSB repair via H3K27me3.

DISCUSSION
HDAC1,2-selective inhibition acts on the
H3K27ac−H3K27me3 balance in the EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells
Approximately 20% of germinal center-derived
DLBCL cells have an activating mutation in the SET
domain of EZH2 that catalyzes aberrantly high H3K27me3
[7]. Addition of GSK126, a potent and selective small
molecule inhibitor of EZH2 activity, decreases H3K27me3,
reactivates PRC2-suppressed genes, such as, BLIMP1
(a tumor suppressor) and induces cytotoxicity in these
lymphoma cells [8]. These findings implicate a role for

the hyperactive mutant EZH2 enzyme and the aberrantly
increased H3K27me3 to the growth and survival of these
GC-DLBCL cells. As a complement to the studies using
GSK126, we show that selective inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity also causes cytotoxicity or cell cycle arrest in the
EZH2GOF GC-DLBCL cells. However, unlike GSK126,
inhibition of HDAC1,2 does not decrease the aberrantly
increased global H3K27me3, but instead leads to a robust
increase in global H3K27ac in these GC-DLBCL cells
(Figure 4). In the absence of DNA damage, the promoters
of DNA damage response genes are repressed and thus,
expected to have high H3K27me3, a mark generally
associated with inactive genes. Since acetylation and
methylation are chemically exclusive modifications that
occur on the ε-amino group of lysine residues, removal
of methylation is required prior to acetylation and vice
versa. Upon inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity and the
ensuing transcriptional activation, H3K27ac is increased
at the promoters of the DNA damage response genes
without a concomitant decrease in H3K27me3. Therefore,

our results demonstrate that demethylation or removal of
preexisting H3K27me3 marks, either globally or locally,
is not necessary for the increase in chromatin-associated
H3K27ac to occur. How then can acetylation at H3K27
occur without the removal of H3K27me3? Since each
nucleosome contains two H3 subunits, acetylation can
occur on the unmodified H3K27 present within the same
nucleosome as the trimethylated H3K27 or alternatively,
acetylation might occur on the unmodified H3K27
present in the neighboring nucleosome. Therefore, one
can envision the presence of an interesting and intricate
mechanism underlying the lymphomagenesis and survival
of the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells involving the maintenance
of the fine balance between acetylation and methylation
at the H3K27 residue. In the DLBCL cells, HDAC1,2 via
their interaction with PRC2 containing the hyperactive
EZH2 maintain an aberrant ‘H3K27me3>H3K27ac’
state, which likely promotes the lymphomagenesis and/
or survival of these lymphoma cells, through repressing
the DNA damage response genes. Inhibiting EZH2 activity

increases H3K27ac at DNA damage response genes to increase their transcription. A and B together overcomes the survival advantage
provided by increased H3K27me3 in these EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. C: HDAC1,2 inhibition increases H4K91ac and decreases H4K91
monoubiquitination following doxorubicin treatment. This results in a defective 53BP1 recruitment to damage sites and defective repair of
doxorubicin-induced breaks. Hence, HDAC1,2 inhibition overcomes BBAP-mediated chemoresistance following doxorubicin treatment in
DLBCL cells with EZH2 hyperactive mutation.

or HDAC1,2 activity therefore shifts the balance towards
the ‘H3K27ac>H3K27me3’ state, which might lead to
the activation of select DNA damage response genes and
trigger either cell cycle arrest or death in the EZH2GOF
mutant DLBCL cells.

for efficient repair. Inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity via the
effect on histone acetylation and chromatin may relieve
this transcriptional repression at damage sites to impair the
ongoing DNA repair. In addition to polycomb complexes
(PRC1 and PRC2), the NuRD complex also promotes
transcriptional repression at break sites [43]. HDAC1,2
are the catalytic components of the NuRD complex.
Therefore, HDAC1,2 inhibition would not only impair
polycomb-mediated transcription at break sites but could
also impair NuRD-mediated transcriptional repression at
DSB sites.
Apart from maintaining transcriptional repression
at break sites, H3K27me3 also acts as a docking site for
a second polycomb complex PRC1 during DSB repair
signaling [56]. PRC1 maintains gene repression via
ubiquitination of H2AK119 [56]. H2AK119 ubiquitination
mediated by the PRC1 complex helps in the recruitment
of several repair factors, such as, BRCA1 and 53BP1 and
perpetuates the damage signaling [57]. Hence, reduced
accumulation of H3K27me3 at break sites in the absence
of HDAC1,2 could also impair the recruitment of PRC1
complex and downstream EZH2-mediated H2AK119
repair signaling, the hypothesis that is currently under
investigation.

Regulation of EZH2-dependent DSB repair by
HDAC1,2
HDAC1,2 localize to double-strand break (DSB)
sites and play a role during DSB repair [44, 52]. Cancer
cells are in general ‘addicted’ to DNA repair and use
DSB repair as one survival mechanism to overcome
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Polycomb
group proteins have been extensively studied in the
context of transcription. Linking these proteins to genome
maintenance, increased association of polycomb proteins
with chromatin was observed in a screen for chromatinassociated proteins following DNA damage [43]. The
H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 is the catalytic component
of polycomb group PRC2 complex. Depletion of EZH2
by shRNA makes cells sensitive to IR treatment [45],
suggesting a role for EZH2 in DSB repair. EZH2 localizes
to DSB sites and catalyzes H3K27me3, and both these
factors are enriched at DSB sites following DNA damage
[43]. Hence, increased H3K27me3 mediated DSB repair
might be one mechanism by which EZH2GOF DLBCL cells
might develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
We show that inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity decreases
H3K27me3 at break sites and activates the DNA damage
response in the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells (Figures 5 and
6). Hence, HDAC1,2 inhibition overcomes H3K27me3mediated DSB repair and sensitizes the EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells to DNA damage. Even though H3K27me3 is
enriched at laser-induced break sites, H3K27ac is not
excluded from the break sites, as it does not form ‘antistripe’ (Supplementary Figure 4). How do HDAC1,2
then regulate H3K27me3 at break sites? One possibility
is that HDAC1,2 might target an acetyl mark other than
H3K27ac that regulates EZH2-mediated H3K27me3.
Alternatively, we favor a model where HDAC1,2 might
remove only a few H3K27ac marks localized around
break site which is sufficient to promote the addition of
new H3K27me3 marks, but insufficient to be detected by
immunofluorescence technique.
H3K27me3 is a transcriptional repression mark [23].
What might the function of a transcriptional repression
histone mark be at DSB sites? Transcription by RNA
polymerase II is transiently repressed at break sites to
prevent the transcription machinery from interfering with
the ongoing repair process [53-55]. Also, transcriptional
silencing might prevent any destabilizing changes in
the chromatin around break sites by establishing a more
condensed, heterochromatin-like state that maintains the
broken chromosomal ends in close proximity to each other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Regulation of BBAP-mediated DSB repair by
HDAC1,2
In a screen to identify genes associated with
the curable versus fatal DLBCLs, a gene called BAL
(B-aggressive lymphoma) was highly expressed in fatal
tumors [58]. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified BBAP
or DTX3L as a BAL-binding protein [15]. BBAP contains
a C-terminal RING-finger domain that monoubiquitinates
H4K91 [15, 17]. BBAP enzyme is most abundant in
DLBCLs with a prominent immune infiltrate and increased
IFNγ production [16]. BBAP monoubiquitinates H4K91,
promotes the recruitment of methyltransferase for H4K20
methylation, aids the DNA repair process and protects cells
from DNA damaging agents to promote chemoresistance
[17]. Inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity leads to a more rapid
cell death compared to inhibition of EZH2 activity alone,
suggesting that factors in addition to H3K27me3 might
contribute to the chemoresistance in EZH2GOF DLBCL.
This possibility prompted us to examine BBAP levels
in the chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. We find
that the refractory EZH2GOF DLBCL cells expressing a
hyperactive EZH2 enzyme also overexpress the enzyme
BBAP. Hence, the BBAP activity likely contributes to
chemoresistance in addition to the EZH2 activity, and thus
accounts for the difference in the efficacy of GSK126 and
ACY-957 on the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. This may also
explain why refractory EZH2GOF DLBCL cells, such as
Karpas-422, respond slowly to EZH2 inhibition compared
to HDAC1,2 inhibition (7 days for GSK126 versus 3 days

for ACY-957) [8], as BBAP activity in these DLBCL cells
might protect these cells from any DNA damage even in
the absence of EZH2 activity.
Inhibition of HDAC1,2 activity in the EZH2GOF
DLBCL cells increases acetylation at H4K91, the
residue monoubiquitinated by BBAP (Figure 7).
H4K91ubiquitination is required for efficient 53BP1
recruitment to damage sites at early time points during
repair [17]. We observed a delay in the kinetics of 53BP1
foci formation upon HDAC1,2 inhibition (Figure 8)
similar to that observed in BBAP knockdown cells [17].
The H4K91 ubiquitination induced by DNA damage is
abolished upon HDAC1,2 inhibition. Therefore, HDAC1,2
inhibition overcomes BBAP-mediated chemoresistance by
increasing H4K91ac to inhibit H4K91 ubiquitination and
thus, impair DSB repair mediated by 53BP1 recruitment to
triggering DNA damage in the lymphoma cells. Recently,
an increase in H4K16ac was reported to interfere with the
H4K20me-binding by 53BP1 and its localization to break
sites [59]. In addition to H4K91ac, an increase in H4K16ac
was also observed in ACY-957-treated EZH2GOF DLBCL
cells (Figure 7B). Hence, the increase in H4K16ac is
another mechanism by which 53BP1 recruitment to break
sites is impaired by inhibition of HDAC1,2. H4K91ac is
also involved in chromatin assembly during DNA repair
in yeast. H4K91ac is proposed to influence nucleosome
assembly by regulating interactions between the H3-H4
tetramer core and the H2A-H2B dimers [50]. During DNA
damage response and repair, proper chromatin reassembly
is essential to maintain genome stability. Hence,
investigation of the mechanism by which HDAC1,2
modulate chromatin assembly following DNA repair via
H4K91 deacetylation is warranted in future studies.

BBAP at the H3K27 and H4K91 residues, respectively,
to potentially inhibit DSB repair at various steps: DNA
damage signaling mediated by BBAP, transcriptional
repression at break sites mediated by EZH2 and chromatin
changes around break sites during DNA repair mediated
by H4K91ac. In addition to impairing DSB repair, we
find activation of DNA damage response genes, such as,
BMF and Tp63 upon HDAC1,2 inhibition. Previously, the
molecular responses of isogenic normal and transformed
cells to the pan-HDAC inhibitors, Vorinostat and
Romidepsin, were examined [61]. Both these pan-HDIs
selectively killed transformed cells and induced tumor
cell-selective up regulation of the pro-apoptotic BMF
gene [61]. We find that selective HDAC1,2 inhibition
alone is sufficient to increase BMF gene transcription
in the refractory EZH2GOF DLBCL cells, and therefore,
pan-HDI induction of BMF gene expression is likely
to be mediated in large part due to their inhibition of
HDAC1,2 activity. Hence, HDAC1,2 inhibition appears
to overcome chemoresistance mediated by both EZH2
and BBAP by affecting regulators of genome stability
in the chemoresistant EZH2GOF DLBCL cells and by
activating the transcription of DNA damage response
genes independent of EZH2 function. Therefore, our
results show that the selective inhibition of HDAC1,2
activity is a promising DNA repair mechanism-based
therapeutic approach for chemoresistant EZH2GOF
DLBCL. Examination of HDAC1,2 selective inhibitors
in clinical trials is warranted, in combination with
doxorubicin or other therapeutics with the potential
advantage that chemoresistance in the refractory EZH2GOF
DLBCL may be mitigated to trigger increased cell death.
Currently, inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms using a
HDAC1,2-selective inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy for
other cancers is under investigation.

A novel HDAC1,2-targeted therapy for refractory
EZH2GOF DLBCL

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A major advancement in the treatment of DLBCL
has been made with the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibody (rituximab) to the standard chemotherapy
regimen (CHOP) [2, 60]. However, a significant number
of patients (~40%) have treatment failure and relapse
after the initial response to R-CHOP treatment and no
regimen has been proven to be superior with regard to the
overall survival of DLBCL patients [2, 60]. Hence there
is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to treat relapsed
patients. Overall, in this study, we have made connections
between three important chromatin-modifying enzymes
(HDAC1,2, EZH2 and BBAP) that coordinately play
a role in DNA repair to modulate chemoresistance in
the EZH2GOF DLBCL cells. We show that inhibition of
HDAC1,2 is sufficient to overcome the survival advantage
mediated by EZH2 and BBAP enzymes in the refractory
EZH2GOF DLBCL cells (Figure 10). HDAC1,2-selective
inhibitor interferes or overcomes the activity of EZH2 and

Laser Micro-irradiation repair assay in HeLa cells

Histone Extraction by Trichloroacetic Acid

HeLa cells were seeded in 8-well LabTek II chamber
dishes. After three hours, the media was removed and
replaced with fresh media containing HDAC inhibitors
in the described concentrations. After 24 hours of
drug treatment, cells were pre-sensitized with 1 μg/ml
Hoechst 33342 for ten minutes. Laser microirradiation
was performed on an inverted confocal microscope
(A1R Confocal System, Nikon), using a 405 nm laser
focused through a 60x oil objective. Laser output was
set to 100%, with twelve regions of interest (ROIs) at a
scan speed of 1/16 and pixel dwell of 56.7, which was
sufficient to produce detectable damage without noticeable
cytotoxicity. Microirradiation was performed along
parallel lines (ROIs) that spanned each field of view. Cells
were allowed to recover for 15 minutes, at which time they
were washed once with PBS and fixed for ten minutes in
10% formalin, followed by immunofluorescence staining
after permeabilization with 0.5% Triton-X for 4 minutes.

DLBCL cells were treated with ACY-957 in 25cm2
flasks. Following treatment, cells were pelleted, washed
with PBS and the pellet was re-suspended in 400μl of
lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (200μl 0.5M HEPES.

10μl 1000x Pepstatin A, and water to a total volume of
10mL plus Roche protease inhibitor cocktail). To the cell
suspension, a final concentration of 0.2M sulfuric acid
was added and samples were sonicated twice using the
Fisher FB120 sonicator at amplitude of 50% and with
5 pulses. After sonication, proteins were extracted for
30 minutes at 4°C with end over end rotation. Samples
were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C and histones were precipitated with a 20% final
concentration of trichloroacetic acid and incubated on
ice for 30 minutes or moved directly to -80°C overnight.
Following precipitation, samples were centrifuged again
for 10 minutes and the resulting pellet was washed with
cold acidified acetone (acetone+0.05N HCl). The histone
pellets were centrifuged at the same settings but for 5
minutes then washed again with cold acetone. After this
wash the pellets were centrifuged for another 5 minutes
and the acetone was discarded. Pellets were dried in an
incubator at 37°C for 5 minutes then re-suspended in 50μl
2x SDS sample buffer+β-mercaptoethanol and 8 μl 1M
Tris HCl pH 8 to neutralize. The samples were then boiled
for 8 minutes at 95°C and if there was still visible pellet
they were either boiled longer, sonicated, had more sample
buffer added or a combination thereof.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed in either 10% formalin or
methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min at -20°C. The cells
were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PBS
for 5 min at room temperature (RT), blocked in 10%
normal goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min and stained with
primary antibody for 1 h at RT. Cells were incubated with
secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa
Fluor 488/546) at a 1:600 dilution for 45 min at RT, and
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at 1:500
dilution to visualize the nuclei. Images were captured
using Zeiss Axioskop mot plus microscope and analyzed
using the AxioVision software.
