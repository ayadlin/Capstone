Abstract
Reversible phosphorylation plays a critical role in DNA repair. Here, we report the results of a loss-of-function
screen that identiﬁes the PP2A heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatases PPP2R2A, PPP2R2D, PPP2R5A, and
PPP2R3C in double-strand break (DSB) repair. In particular, we found that PPP2R2A-containing complexes
directly dephosphorylated ATM at S367, S1893, and S1981 to regulate its retention at DSB sites. Increased ATM
phosphorylation triggered by PPP2R2A attenuation dramatically upregulated the activity of the downstream
effector kinase CHK2, resulting in G1 to S-phase cell-cycle arrest and downregulation of BRCA1 and RAD51. In
tumor cells, blocking PPP2R2A thereby impaired the high-ﬁdelity homologous recombination repair pathway and
sensitized cells to small-molecule inhibitors of PARP. We found that PPP2R2A was commonly downregulated
in non–small cell lung carcinomas, suggesting that PPP2R2A status may serve as a marker to predict therapeutic
efﬁcacy to PARP inhibition. In summary, our results deepen understanding of the role of PP2A family
phosphatases in DNA repair and suggest PPP2R2A as a marker for PARP inhibitor responses in clinic.

Introduction
Genome stability is essential for the prevention of undue
cellular death and cancer development. To maintain genome
integrity, cells have evolved multiple DNA repair pathways (1).
One of the most powerful activators of the DNA repair response
is double-strand breaks (DSB).
Initiation of DSB repair is controlled by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–like kinase (PIKK) family. A wave of phosphorylation events radiating from PIKKs is ampliﬁed to convey the
signals to a large number of substrates. Although this cascade
has been studied in a great detail, the biologic relevance of
many of these phosphorylation events and the mechanisms
that control their downregulation remain unknown (2). It is
conceivable that Ser/Thr protein phosphatases could be
responsible for keeping proteins involved in DNA repair
response in an inactive state under normal conditions or for
inactivating the signaling once DNA has been repaired. However, phosphorylation of a number of PIKKs, including ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATR, and CHK2, oscillates

during the DNA repair process (3, 4), suggesting that phosphatases may serve not only as negative regulators but also as
active modulators of DNA damage response.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) refers to a large family of
heterotrimeric Ser/Thr phosphatases. The PP2A core enzyme
consists of a catalytic C subunit and a structural A subunit. In
mammals, 2 distinct genes encode closely related versions of
both the PP2A A (Aa/PPP2R1A and Ab/PPP2R1B) and C (Ca/
PPP2CA and Cb/PPP2CB) subunits. The AC dimer recruits a
third regulatory B subunit, which is responsible for the substrate speciﬁcity and function of the PP2A heterotrimeric
complex. Four unrelated families of B subunits have been
identiﬁed to date: B/B55/PPP2R2A, B0 /B56/PR61/PPP2R5,
B00 /PR72/PPP2R3, and Striatin/STRN. Approximately 100 distinct complexes can be formed through combinatorial association of these subunits, and it is believed that speciﬁc PP2A
complexes mediate particular physiologic functions (5, 6).
PP2A has been directly implicated in the negative regulation
of DSB DNA repair proteins, including g-H2AX, ATM, CHK1,
and CHK2 (2). However, consistent with the idea that protein
phosphatases are not just negative regulators of DNA repair
signaling, selective inhibition of PP2A activity impairs DNA
repair (7–9). PP2A function is also essential for activation of
cell-cycle checkpoints in response to irradiation (10, 11). One
potential explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that
several distinct PP2A complexes may modulate different steps
of the DNA repair process.
Here, we assessed the role of speciﬁc PP2A complexes in
control of DSB repair and identify PPP2R2A as a critical
effector of the homologous recombination (HR) repair through
modulation of ATM phosphorylation. Critically, defects of HR
DNA repair in PPP2R2A-depleted cells dramatically increased

their sensitivity to PARP enzyme inhibition. Finally, we show
that PPP2R2A is commonly downregulated in non–small cell
lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and therefore propose PPP2R2A
status as a predictive marker for sensitivity to PARP inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and cell lines
Lentiviral pLA CMV N-Flag vector was used to generate Flagtagged PPP2R2A. The pLKO.1-puro shGFP, pLKO.1-puro shLuciferase (shLuc), and pLKO.1-puro vectors containing short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting speciﬁc PP2A subunits were
provided by the RNAi Consortium (12). The RNAi experiments
were carried out using ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools against
PPP2R2A and PPP2CA (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
or RPMI (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin. Lentiviral infections were carried out as
described previously (12). To induce DSBs, cells were treated
with bleomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or irradiated using the linear
accelerator (6 MV photons, Varian Medical Systems).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were washed with PBS, ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, treated
with 100 mg/mL RNase A, and stained with 50 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI). 5-Bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation was analyzed using the In Situ Cell Proliferation Kit
FLUOS (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cellcycle distribution and BrdUrd immunostaining were assessed
by FACSCanto (Becton-Dickinson).
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Cells were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mmol/L
NaCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 300 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
10 mmol/L PIPES, pH 6.8, containing protease inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). The cell lysates
were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at
500  g for 5 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant and pellet were
designated as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively.
The nuclear fraction was resuspended in 10 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 250 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and treated with RNase-free DNase
I (80 mg/mL; Roche) for 30 minutes at 37 C.
Immunoprecipitations were conducted 24 hours after transfection in lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 1%
NP-40, 250 mmol/L NaCl, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). The protein lysates were precleaned by incubation
with sepharose-A beads and incubated with anti-Flag M2
beads (Sigma-Aldrich) or with anti-ATM antibody (Novus
Biologicals) and sepharose-protein A beads (GE Healthcare)
overnight at 4 C. Flag complexes were eluted using 3Flag
peptide (Sigma-Aldrich).
The following antibodies were used: goat polyclonal antiATM, (Novus Biologicals), mouse monoclonal anti-PP2AC (BD
Biosciences, clone 46), and mouse monoclonal anti-BRCA1
(Santa Cruz, clone D-9). The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling: rabbit polyclonal anti-Flag, rabbit

mouse monoclonal anti-PP2A A (clone 4G7), rabbit polyclonal
anti-phospho-CHK1 (S317), and rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-CHK1 (S345; clone 133D3).
Neutral comet assay
Microscope slides were precoated with a thin layer of normal
melting point agarose. Cell suspensions were placed into a
tube containing low melting point agarose and transferred to a
glass microscope slide. Slides were placed in 2 mol/L NaCl,
30 mmol/L Na2EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100,
and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pH 8.0, for 1 hour at 4 C.
After lysis, the slides were rinsed for 20 minutes in solution
0.3 mol/L NaOH, 1 mmol/L EDTA and were subjected to
electrophoresis at 0.7 V/cm and 50 mA for 20 minutes. The
slides were then rinsed with 1 mol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and
dried with prechilled absolute ethanol and stained with PI
(2 mg/mL). Comet images were examined at 200 magniﬁcation with Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope. The tail moment
values were quantiﬁed by CometScore software v1.5.
Immunoﬂuorescent microscopy
Cells were plated on cover slips or mClear-96 well plates
(Greiner Bio-One) and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature and permeabilized with ice-cold
methanol for 5 minutes at 20 C. The cells were incubated in
blocking buffer 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30
minutes at room temperature and then with primary antibodies. After 3 washes with 0.3% BSA in PBS, the secondary
antibody was added. The following antibodies were used:
mouse monoclonal anti-g-H2AX (S139; Millipore, clone
JBW301) and mouse monoclonal anti-RAD51 (Abcam, clone
14B4).
Automated Image analysis was conducted using IN Cell
Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen), and cDNA
was synthesized using the Advantage RT-PCR Kit (Clontech).
A list of primers used for real-time quantitative PCR is presented in Supplementary Fig. S3A. Real-time PCRs were carried
out in a Roche LightCycler-480-96 (Roche), using SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Roche).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis of The Lung Cancer cDNA and Cancer Survey cDNA
arrays (OriGene) was conducted using an ABI 7500 (Applied
Biosystems).
NHEJ and HR DNA repair assays
Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair efﬁciency was
analyzed using H1299dA3-1 cells, which contain a chromosomally integrated copy of the pIRES-TK-EGFP DNA construct
(a generous gift of Dr. Kohno, National Cancer Center Research

used 293 DR-GFP cells, which contain a single integrated copy
of the transgenic reporter DR-GFP. H1299dA3-1 and 293 DRGFP cells were transfected with shRNAs against luciferase or
PPP2R2A. Following puromycin selection, cells were transfected with I-SceI expression vector. The number of GFPpositive cells was measured 48 hours later by ﬂow cytometric
analysis using a FACSCanto (Becton-Dickinson).
In vitro phosphatase assay
293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged PPP2R2A,
Wip1, and a kinase-dead Wip1-D314A mutant. FLAG-tagged
proteins were immunoprecipitated in anti-Flag (M2)-coated
96-well plates (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitated complexes were incubated with phosphopeptides for 30 minutes
at 37 C. Release of free phosphate was measured 20 minutes
after addition of Malachite Green solution using a VictortmX3
Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
Clonogenic survival assay and cell viability
About 105 cells per 10-cm dish were plated in triplicate and
then irradiated or treated with ABT-888 (Enzo Life Sciences).
After 12 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet (SigmaAldrich) and counted using ImageJ software. Cell viability was
analyzed with a Vi-Cell XR counter.
Human xenograft assays
Xenografts were established in female NMRI-nu (nu/nu)/6week mice (Janvier) with A549 cell line by s.c. injection (2.0 
106 cells per 0.2 mL/mouse). Tumors were staged to a preselected size using the following formula: volume ¼ (tumor
length  tumor width2)/2. ABT-888 (25 mg/kg) was administered orally (twice daily for 9 days) in a vehicle containing 0.85%
NaCl adjusted to pH 4.0.
Tumors were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, parafﬁnembedded, sectioned, and immunostained with rat anti-mouse
Ki67 antibody (Dako). Immunodetection was conducted with
R.T.U. Vectastain kit (Vector laboratories). Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. For apoptosis detection In
Situ Death detection kit, ﬂuorescein (Roche) staining was
conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Results
Identiﬁcation of PP2A speciﬁc complexes involved in
DSB repair
Although previous studies showed that PP2A negatively
regulates PIKK-induced signaling, more recent reports have
shown that PP2A inhibition impairs DNA repair (7, 8). To
further investigate this apparent conundrum, we silenced the
more abundant PP2A catalytic subunit, PPP2CA. Because cells
expressing very low levels of PPP2CA proliferate poorly (14, 15),
we used shRNAs that only partially suppress PPP2CA expression (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous report (7), both
immunoblot analysis of g-H2AX and automatic image analysis
of g-H2AX immunostaining revealed that partial depletion of
PPP2CA resulted in inefﬁcient DNA repair (Fig. 1A and B).
To systematically identify PP2A complexes that mediate
DSB repair, we conducted a loss-of-function screen using

6416

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

shRNA library that targets each of the known PP2A B regulatory subunits (16). qRT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed the knockdown (KD) in each of the shRNA-expressing cell lines (Fig. 1C;
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Whenever speciﬁc antibodies were
available, we also conﬁrmed silencing of the PP2A subunits by
immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
In addition to PPP2CA, we found that suppression of 4
PP2A regulatory subunits, PPP2R2A, PPP2R2D, PPP2R5A,
and PPP2R3C, resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05 by
Student t test) increase of g-H2AX compared with cells expressing shGFP (Fig. 1C). For PPP2R5B and STRN3 subunits, only
expression of 1 of 2 shRNAs resulted in g-H2AX increase, most
probably due to off-target effects (Fig. 1C). These results indicate
that PP2A B regulatory subunits, PPP2R2A, PPP2R2D, PPP2R5A,
and PPP2R3C, could be involved in control of DSB repair.
PPP2R2A is commonly downregulated in NSCLCs
Inefﬁcient DNA repair mediated by suppression of speciﬁc
PP2A B subunits suggests the contribution of these PP2A
subunits to tumor suppression. In consonance with this idea,
recent analysis of outlying expression coincident with extreme
copy number alterations has identiﬁed PPP2R2A, one of our
hits, as a putative tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer (17).
Moreover, high-resolution analyses of somatic copy number
alterations of large-scale datasets revealed statistically significant loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the PPP2R2A-containing
region in human cancers (18, 19). Reduced PPP2R2A mRNA
expression was also found in prostate adenocarcinoma samples (20, 21).
Our qRT-PCR analysis of PPP2R2A mRNA expression in 245
samples covering 14 cancer types conﬁrmed that PPP2R2A was
downregulated in lung and thyroid carcinomas (P < 0.05; Fig.
2A; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Further analysis of PPP2R2A
mRNA expression in a panel of 21 NSCLC samples with
matched normal tissues revealed at least a 2-fold decrease in
PPP2R2A mRNA in 8 of 21 NSCLC samples (Fig. 2B).
A signiﬁcant correlation (P ¼ 0.0683) between the frequency
of PPP2R2A LOH and the percentage of samples with downregulated PPP2R2A expression across different cancer types
(Supplementary Fig. S4B) suggests that decreased PPP2R2A
expression in human cancers is due to LOH of the PPP2R2Acontaining region. To test this idea, we analyzed PPP2R2A
expression in a set of lung carcinoma cell lines with known
status of PPP2R2A LOH (Supplementary Fig. S4C). In fact,
immunoblot analysis of PPP2R2A expression revealed lower
levels of PPP2R2A in cell lines harboring PPP2R2A LOH (Fig.
2C). A common downregulation of PPP2R2A in NSCLCs due to
LOH of PPP2R2A-containing region further supports the idea
that PPP2R2A functions as a tumor suppressor. Thus, our
further studies were focused on PPP2R2A.
PPP2R2A inhibits the HR repair by affecting cell-cycle
progression in response to DNA damage
We validated the results of the loss-of-function screen by
analyzing g-H2AX after PPP2R2A suppression at different time
points following irradiation or bleomycin treatment (Fig. 3A
and B). Moreover, overexpression of shRNA resistant form of
PPP2R2A in PPP2R2A-KD cells restored g-H2AX levels (Fig.

3C), indicating that inefﬁcient DSB repair is triggered specifically by loss of PPP2R2A. Single-cell gel electrophoresis also
revealed that unresolved DNA damage induced by camptothecin was signiﬁcantly higher in PPP2R2A-KD cells (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, our observations strongly support the idea
that PPP2R2A plays a key role in DSB DNA repair.
To assess a possible mechanism by which PPP2R2A modulates DSB repair, we elucidated the effect of PPP2R2A suppression on 2 major pathways of DSB repair, NHEJ and HR (22,
23). We found that although suppression of PPP2R2A facilitated the NHEJ repair, the HR pathway was dramatically
inhibited in PPP2R2A-KD cells (Fig. 4A and B). Consistently,
we found a decreased Rad51 foci formation in cells expressing
shPPP2R2A (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, 8 hours
after irradiation, expression of both BRCA1 and RAD51 was
signiﬁcantly decreased in PPP2R2A-KD cells (Fig. 4D). Together, these results indicate that loss of PPP2R2A impairs the HR
mechanism.
Because the balance between NHEJ and HR repair depends
on the phase of cell cycle (22, 24), we examined the effect of

www.aacrjournals.org

PPP2R2A on irradiation-induced cell-cycle checkpoints. We
found that 8 hours after irradiation, HeLa cells expressing
shGFP accumulated in G2 to S-phase, whereas cells with
suppressed PPP2R2A were mostly in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle (Fig. 4E and F). In addition, BrdUrd incorporation after
irradiation was dramatically decreased in PPP2R2A-KD cells
(Fig. 4G). We also observed that I-SceI–induced DSBs resulted
in accumulation of 293DR-GFP-shPPP2R2A cells in the G1
phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 4H). In concordance with these
results, we found that in response to irradiation expression of
the cell-cycle–promoting phosphatase, CDC25A (25) was signiﬁcantly decreased in PPP2R2A-depleted cells (Fig. 4I). Taken
together, these data indicate that PPP2R2A modulates the HR
repair through regulation of G1–S cell-cycle checkpoint.
Accelerated Cdc25A turnover after DNA damage is regulated
by the CHK1 and CHK2 kinases (26, 27). Therefore, we analyzed
the effect of PPP2R2A on CHK1 or CHK2 activation. Although
inhibition of PPP2R2A did not affect CHK1 phosphorylation at
S296, S217, and S345, we observed a signiﬁcant accumulation of
CHK2 phosphorylated at T68 in PPP2R2A-KD cells (Fig. 4I),

suggesting that G1–S checkpoint induced by loss of PPP2R2A is
mediated by prolonged activation of the CHK2 kinase.
PPP2R2A directly regulates ATM phosphorylation
CHK2 is a direct downstream target of ATM, whereas ATM
has been shown to be directly regulated by PP2A. In particular,
a previous report (28) reveals that a speciﬁc PP2A inhibitor,
okadaic acid, induces ATM autophosphorylation at S1981.
Moreover, the authors showed interaction between ATM and
PP2A A and C subunits. However, speciﬁc PP2A regulatory
subunit(s) involved in ATM dephosphorylation has not been
identiﬁed, whereas our data suggest that PPP2R2A may affect
CHK2 activity by regulating ATM dephosphorylation.
Indeed, we found that suppression of PPP2R2A resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase of ATM phosphorylated at S1981 (Fig. 5A),
whereas restoration of PPP2R2A expression by overexpression
of shRNA-resistant silent mutant of PPP2R2A rescued this
increase (Fig. 4B). Although ATM phosphorylation is considered as a sign of ATM activation, there are contradictory data
how it affects ATM functions. Studies of ATM-S1987A (mouse
homologue of human S1981) mice showed normal ATMdependent phosphorylation of ATM substrates, activation of
cell-cycle checkpoints, and localization of ATM to DSBs (29,

6418

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

30). In vitro studies using human recombinant ATM proteins
revealed that phosphorylation does not affect its kinase activity
(31–33). In human cells, ATM phosphorylation at S1981 is also
dispensable for the ability of ATM to localize to DSBs, but it is
required for ATM retention at DSBs (34). Consistently with this
report, immunoﬂuorescent analysis of ATM revealed an
increase of the size of ATM foci in PPP2R2A-KD cells (Fig.
5C), further conﬁrming the idea that phosphorylation regulates
ATM retention at the sites of DSBs (34).
These ﬁndings suggest that PPP2R2A controls DNA repair
through regulation of the ATM signaling. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether PPP2R2A affects DNA repair in HeLa
ATM SilenciX (ATM KD) cells. Indeed, analysis of g-H2AX levels
in ATM-deﬁcient cells revealed that suppression of PPP2R2A in
these cells did not affect the kinetics of DNA repair (Fig. 5D).
To determine whether PPP2R2A directly regulates ATM
dephosphorylation, we conducted a set of reciprocal immunoprecipitations. We found PPP2R2A together with PP2A A
and C subunits in complex with ATM (Fig. 6A). Using in vitro
phosphatase assays, we also found that phosphopeptides
corresponding to human ATM pS367, pS1893, and pS1981, but
not pT1885 and pS2996, were efﬁciently dephosphorylated by
PPP2R2A-speciﬁc complexes (Fig. 6B). Given that we observed

an interaction between PPP2R2A heterotrimeric complexes
and ATM, increased ATM phosphorylation in PPP2R2A-depleted cells, and in vitro dephosphorylation of 3 ATM autophosphorylation sites (S367, S1893, and S1981) by PPP2R2A-speciﬁc complexes, it seems likely that ATM is a direct target for
PPP2R2A-speciﬁc PP2A phosphatase in vivo.
Wip1 phosphatase has been also shown to dephosphorylate ATM at S1981 and S367, but not at S1893 (refs. 35,
36; Fig. 6B), indicating that PPP2R2A and Wip1 may differentially regulate ATM dephosphorylation at different sites.
Moreover, in contrast to PP2A subunit PPP2R2A, Wip1
expression is extremely low in undamaged cells (Fig. 6C),
and depletion of Wip1 does not affect the level of phosphorylated ATM under normal conditions (35). Taken together,
these data suggest that PPP2R2A-containing PP2A holoenzyme is the major ATM phosphatase in the absence of DNA
damage.
Irradiation triggered transient dissociation of the ATM–
PPP2R2A complex, allowing accumulation of phosphorylated ATM (Fig. 6D). This observation is consistent with a
previous report (28) that revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in

the amount of ATM associated with PP2A A and C subunits
after irradiation. Interestingly, ATM mediates the irradiation-induced dissociation of the PPP2R2A subunit from the
PP2A AC core dimer (37), implicating ATM in the disruption
of functional PPP2R2A-containing PP2A complexes. Consistently with this report, 15 minutes after irradiation,
PPP2R2A-associated phosphatase activity was decreased.
Thirty minutes after irradiation PPP2R2A was found again
in complex with ATM, which is also correlated with an
increase of PPP2R2A-speciﬁc phosphatase activity toward
ATM phosphopeptides (Fig. 6D and E). This kinetics is
consistent with the kinetics of ATM recruitment/dissociation to the sites of DSBs (34). These data also suggest the
existence of a negative feedback loop between PPP2R2A and
ATM.

of PPP2R2A sensitized cells to IR (Fig. 7A). Moreover, HR
deﬁciency predicts hypersensitivity to inhibition of PARP
(38, 39). In fact, analysis of cell survival after treatment with
ABT-888 (veliparib), a potent inhibitor of PARP1 and
PARP2, revealed that PPP2R2A-KD cells are more sensitive
to ABT-888 treatment (Fig. 7B). To validate this observation,
we examined the sensitivity to PARP inhibition of lung
carcinoma cell lines with different levels of PPP2R2A
expression. Consistently, we found that cell lines with
higher PPP2R2A expression had lower sensitivity to ABT-

ABT-888 treatment also inhibited growth of PPP2R2A-KD
A549 xenografts (Fig. 7D). Moreover, we observed signiﬁcantly
reduced proliferation rate and increased apoptosis in
PPP2R2A-KD tumors compared with shGFP-expressing
tumors (Fig. 7E and F). These results strongly indicate that
both PPP2R2A expression levels and LOH in the PPP2R2Acontaining region can be used to predict tumor sensitivity to
treatment with PARP inhibitors.

Discussion
PP2A is a ubiquitously expressed family of Ser/Thr protein
phosphatases, and the diversity of PP2A functions suggests
that particular PP2A complexes may contribute independently
to complex phenotypes, such as the DNA damage response (5,
6). Indeed, we found that suppression of 4 different PP2A
regulatory B subunits (PPP2R2A, PPP2R2D, PPP2R5A, and
PPP2R3C) impairs the efﬁciency of DNA repair, suggesting
that these speciﬁc PP2A complexes are involved in control of
DNA repair. In our prior study, we conducted a loss-of-function
screen using a similar shPP2A library to identify PP2A subunits
involved in human cell transformation (16). This screen implicates 3 PP2A regulatory subunits, PPP2R5A, PPP2R5C, and
PPP2R3A, in control of cell transformation. Our present results
suggest that in addition to modulating c-Myc and Wnt activity
(16), PPP2R5A could also contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype by impairing DNA repair efﬁciency. Consistent with this
idea, it has been shown that PPP2R5A could directly dephosphorylate both c-Myc (40) and CHK2 kinase (41). However, the
exact mechanism(s) by which PPP2R2D, PPP2R5A, and
PPP2R3C contribute to DNA response needs to be further
investigated.
In summary, our study revealed that dephosphorylation of
ATM at S367, S1893, and S1981 by PPP2R2A-speciﬁc complexes regulates retention of ATM foci. Dysregulation of ATM
triggered by loss of PPP2R2A induces G1–S checkpoint and
inhibits HR repair. These observations further challenge the

view that protein phosphatases serve only as negative regulators of DNA repair. Instead, our data suggest that tight
regulation of phosphorylation events during DNA repair by
speciﬁc protein phosphatases is required for timely DSB DNA
repair.
Analysis of PPP2R2A expression in human cancers revealed
that PPP2R2A mRNA expression is commonly downregulated
in NSCLCs. PPP2R2A gene is located at 8p21 chromosome
region, which is frequently deleted in a wide range of epithelial
cancers (42). However, a homozygous deletion of PPP2R2Acontaining locus is a more rare event in human cancers. As an
example, a recent analysis of 141 clinical prostate tumors
revealed PPP2R2A deletions in 61.7% of tumor samples with
only 3 recurrent homozygous deletions (2.1%; ref. 43). These
results are consistent with our observation that PPP2R2A
expression is downregulated in NSCLC cell lines but never
completely lost. As far as no potentially important somatic
mutations of PPP2R2A have been reported, these data implicate PPP2R2A as a haploinsufﬁcient tumor suppressor gene in
epithelial cancers.
PARP inhibitors are emerging as a promising class of
anticancer agents particularly effective against tumors with
loss of functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 (38). However, BRCA1
and BRCA2 mutation carriers comprise less than 5% of
breast cancer cases, and in lung cancer, BRCA mutations
are even much less common. Therefore, there is a pressing
need to identify novel biomarkers that would predict
