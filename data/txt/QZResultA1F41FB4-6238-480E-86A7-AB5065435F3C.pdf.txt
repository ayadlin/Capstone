BACKGROUND: Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) decreases bone mineral density (BMD) and increases
fracture risk in patients with prostate carcinoma. The authors investigated the effectiveness of a single infusion of zoledronic acid initiated subsequent to ADT on BMD with hormone-naive prostate carcinoma.
METHODS: Forty men received either a single infusion of zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously on Day 1) or
no infusion during ADT. BMD of the proximal femur and posteroanterior lumbar spine was measured by
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and urinary N-telopeptide (u-NTx) at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At
baseline, the overall BMDs demonstrated no significant difference in lumbar spine and hip regions. At
6months, mean (standard error) BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar spine decreased 4.6%  1.0% in
control patients and increased 5.1%  1.2% in patients receiving zoledronic acid, a significant difference
(P ¼ .0002). At 12 months, the change in BMD between the 2 groups was statistically significantly different
at the lumbar region (P ¼ .0004), indicating that zoledronate preserved BMD. For u-NTx, bone turnover
was statistically significantly decreased in the zoledronate group compared with controls at 6 months (P <
.0001), but returned to pretreatment levels at 12 months in the zoledronate group. CONCLUSIONS: Bone
loss begins at 6 months with ADT. A single infusion of zoledronic acid in patients receiving ADT reduces
bone mineral loss and maintains BMD at least at 12 months during ADT. Further study is needed to determine the best dosing schedule to prevent ADT-induced bone loss in men with hormone-naive prostate carC 2009 American Cancer Society.

recent years in the proportion of patients with localized
and advanced prostate carcinoma for whom androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is being selected.1,2 Data on the
current treatment of prostate cancer in Japan indicate that
ADT is chosen to treat localized/advanced prostate cancer
in an extremely high proportion of cases.3
Testosterone is the primary male hormone and is
important in establishing and maintaining the typical
male characteristics. Possible adverse effects (AEs) of
ADT, in the form of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists, are generally related to changing levels
of hormones, such as hot flushes, loss of muscle mass,
erectile dysfunction, fatigue, anemia, and osteoporosis.
The results of several prospective studies show that a
rapid loss of bone mineral density (BMD) occurs within
the first 6 to 12 months of ADT.4,5 The risk of skeletal
fracture associated with ADT was recently reported,6 and
it is important to note that a skeletal fracture in a patient
with prostate carcinoma is an independent and adverse
predictor of survival.7 Recent studies have shown that
bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, pamidronate,
risedronate, and zoledronic acid, will maintain the
increased BMD in patients on ADT.8-12 However, the
durable or long-term efficacy of zoledronic acid is still
unknown.
We investigated the effectiveness of a single infusion
of zoledronic acid initiated subsequent to ADT on BMD
and biochemical markers of bone turnover in patients
with hormone-naive prostate carcinoma. The main focus
of this study was to evaluate the near-term effectiveness of
a single infusion of zoledronic acid during the 12 months
after ADT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Study participants were recruited at Kitasato University
Hospital between September 2006 and March 2007. All
patients had prostate adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis and did not receive any hormonal therapy (hormone
naive) previously. Treatment with GnRH agonist was initiated at study entry in all patients. Men with metabolic
bone disease, history of treatment for osteoporosis, a serum calcium level <8.4 mg/dL or >10.6 mg/dL, or a seCancer

rum creatinine concentration >1.5 mg/dL were also
excluded. At the screening visit, BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar spine and proximal femur was determined by
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). T score was calculated from a Japanese male reference database.13
Patients with T score of 2.5 or less were excluded.

Study Design
This study was a randomized, prospective controlled pilot
study over 12 months. Eligible patients were simply
randomized by random numbers that are readily generated by computer software (Excel version 2003; Microsoft, Redmond, Wash). Forty eligible patients were
randomly assigned to receive either zoledronic acid at a
dose of 4 mg (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc,
Basel, Switzerland) intravenously on Day 1 only (n ¼ 20)
or no treatment (n ¼ 20). The patients received zoledronic acid simultaneously with the initiation of ADT.
Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 6 months and
12 months. Serum samples were obtained at each visit and
stored at 80 C. BMD was measured by DXA at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. All patients provided
written informed consent.
Safety Assessment
The AEs were monitored every 3 months. Physical examinations and serum creatinine/calcium levels were monitored every 3 months. AEs were scored using the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v.3.0).

Study Endpoints
BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar spine and proximal
femur was determined by DXA using a Hologic QDR
4500A/SL densitometer (Hologic Inc, Waltham, Mass) in
all patients. The DXA device was standardized and calibrated using the Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom
(Hologic Inc). In vivo precision assessment was performed
according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommendation.14 By determining precision
error (0.012 g/cm2) and least significant change (0.034 g/
cm2 at 95% confidence interval [95% CI]), it was

our hospital. Serum concentrations of testosterone (SRL
Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were measured by radioimmunoassays. Urine concentrations of N-telopeptide (NTx; SRL
Inc.) were measured by enzyme immunoassays.

Statistical Analysis
The primary study endpoint was the percentage change in
the BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar spine from baseline to Months 6 and 12. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 13.0;
SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Values are reported as
means  standard error [SE] unless otherwise specified.
All P values were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Forty eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either zoledronic acid (n ¼ 20) or no drug treatment (n ¼
20). Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of patients in
both groups. All patients were hormone naive and received
treatment with a GnRH agonist after study entry.
The mean percentage changes in BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar spine, the total hip, and the femoral
neck differed significantly between groups (Fig. 1). At

lumbar spine decreased 4.6%  1.0% from baseline in
control men and increased 5.1%  1.2% from baseline in

the mean (SE) BMD of the posteroanterior lumbar
spine decreased 8.2%  1.8% from baseline in the control
men and increased 3.5%  0.8% from baseline in the

6 months and to 12 months were 9.7% (95% CI, 7.0%12.4%) and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.4%), respectively.
At 6 months, the mean (SE) BMD of the total hip
decreased 2.2%  0.5% from baseline in the controls and
increased 1.1%  0.7% from baseline in the treatment
group (P ¼ .0025). At 12 months, the mean (SE) BMD
of the total hip decreased 4.6%  1.0% from baseline in
controls and increased 1.1%  0.6% from baseline in

The incidence and mortality of prostate carcinoma is rapidly increasing in Japan. In 2000, the Japanese Urological
Association (JUA) launched a system for registering
patients who were newly diagnosed with prostate carcinoma at institutions authorized by the JUA. The compilation results of 2000 were published and surprisingly
indicated that primary ADT was used in 40% of patients
with T1c disease and in >50% of patients with T2
disease.3
Conversely, the US National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query and American Urological Association
guidelines do not recommend hormonal therapy for treatment of localized prostate carcinoma. However, CaPSURE surveillance data have demonstrated that in recent
years the use of ADT has increased for patients with all
stages of prostate carcinoma.1 Furthermore, several
randomized controlled trials show an overall survival benefit of neoadjuvant ADT as well as adjuvant ADT, and
this combination treatment has had a large impact.15-17
Thus, ADT for prostate carcinoma is being adopted and
the number of patients undergoing ADT may increase
worldwide in the future. However, among men surviving
at least 5 years after the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma,
19.4% of those who received ADT had skeletal fractures,
and there was a statistically significant relationship
between the number of doses of GnRH received during
the 12 months after diagnosis and subsequent risk of
fracture.18 In addition, the occurrence of skeletalrelated events (SREs), including fractures, contributes

significantly to the cost of care for patients with advanced
prostate carcinoma.19 The average total cost of treatment
was €13,051/patient over the 24-month follow-up period,
which includes an average cost of €6973/patient to treat
SREs. Treatment of SREs more than doubled total treatment costs, and these data suggest that bisphosphonates
can reduce SREs and healthcare costs.
Recent studies have shown that bisphosphonates,
such as alendronate, pamidronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid, will maintain the increased BMD in patients
on ADT.8-12 Greenspan et al reported the effect of the
oral bisphosphonate alendronate given orally (70 mg)
once weekly on BMD, and markers of bone turnover in
patients with nonmetastatic prostate carcinoma recently
initiating ADT or receiving ADT for 6 months evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial crossover trial.20 In patients
treated with alendronate, BMD increased over 12 months
by 3.7% (P < .001) at the spine and 1.6% (P ¼ .008) at
the femoral neck. Conversely, patients in the placebo
group had losses of 1.4% (P ¼ .045) at the spine and
0.7% (P ¼ .081) at the femoral neck. At 12 months, the
difference between the 2 groups was 5.1% (P < .001) at
the spine and was 2.3% (P < .001) at the femoral neck.
Intravenous bisphosphonates also increase BMD in
GnRH agonist–treated men.8,10-12 To our knowledge,
Smith et al were the first to assess the effect of zoledronic
acid on BMD during ADT for nonmetastatic prostate carcinoma.8 Patients with prostate carcinoma (no metastases)
who were beginning ADT were randomly assigned to
receive zoledronic acid at a dose of 4 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 months for 1 year. The mean BMD in
the lumbar spine increased by 5.6% in patients receiving
zoledronic acid and decreased by 2.2% in those given placebo (mean difference, 7.8%; P < .001). The mean BMD
of the femoral neck, trochanter, and total hip also
increased in the zoledronic acid group and decreased in
the placebo group after 1 year of therapy.
Israeli et al assessed the benefit of zoledronic acid in
patients with pre-existing bone loss. Patients were
randomized to receive zoledronic acid at a dose of 4 mg or
placebo intravenously every 3 months when initiated during the first year of ADT in patients with locally advanced
prostate carcinoma.11 Although all patients receiving zoledronic acid in their study experienced increases in lumbar
spine and total hip BMD, patients with low baseline T
3472

scores (1 or less and 2 or greater) experienced a greater
magnitude of increase in lumbar spine BMD than
patients with normal baseline T scores (more than 1)
(5.8% vs 4.4%, respectively). A similar difference in the
magnitude of NTx suppression was observed. Zoledronic
acid–treated patients with low baseline T scores experienced greater NTx suppression than patients with normal
baseline T scores (82.7% vs 58.4%, respectively).
These results suggest that patients with pre-existing bone
loss may experience a greater benefit of zoledronic acid
treatment.
In patients with hormone-refractory metastatic
prostate carcinoma, frequent treatment with zoledronic
acid (4 mg every 3 weeks) reportedly decreases the risk of
SREs.21
Patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma and a history of bone metastases were randomly
assigned to a double-blind treatment regimen of intravenous zoledronic acid at a dose of 4 mg, zoledronic acid at
a dose of 8 mg (subsequently reduced to 4 mg; 8/4), or
placebo every 3 weeks for 15 months. The median time to
first SRE (defined as pathologic bone fractures, spinal
cord compression, surgery to bone, radiation therapy to
bone, or a change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone
pain) was 321 days for patients who received placebo, was
not reached for patients who received zoledronic acid at a
dose of 4 mg (P ¼ .011 vs placebo), and was 363 days for
those who received zoledronic acid at a dose of 8/4 mg (P
¼ .491 vs placebo). Given the results of this study, zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3-4 weeks) was approved to treat
patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma
metastatic to bone, and this treatment remains the only
known effective schedule to prevent SRE complications in
patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma.
The results of the current study demonstrate that a
single infusion of zoledronic acid within the first
12 months of ADT prevents bone loss and increases
BMD in men with hormone-naive prostate carcinoma.
Compared with the control group, zoledronic acid significantly increased lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD by
11.7% and 5.7%, respectively (P ¼ .0004 and P ¼ .0008,
respectively). A single infusion of zoledronic acid can provide a durable effect for the hormone-naive patient for at
least 12 months after ADT. When initiating ADT for
hormone-naive patients with prostate carcinoma, the simultaneous use of a single infusion of zoledronic acid

might have not only bone health but also compliance
advantages for ADT-induced osteoporosis, because the
most significant BMD loss occurs within 12 months after
ADT therapy in these men.
The findings of the current study demonstrated that
urinary NTx returned to the pretreatment levels at the 12month follow-up in the zoledronate group. If the changes
in the urinary NTx levels indicate BMD loss in advance,
an annual infusion of zoledronate might be a lower dosage
in this patient population, and an infusion every 6 months
will be favorable to maintain urinary NTx levels.
Our results are consistent with the results of previously published studies,10,12 although we evaluated only
hormone-naive patients (using zoledronic acid with simultaneous ADT) and consistent timing of follow-up of
BMD every 6 months. However, these results do not justify less frequent administration of zoledronic acid to prevent SREs in patients with hormone-naive prostate
carcinoma, because the study was powered to demonstrate
a significant change in BMD, but was not powered to
assess the impact on the risk of SREs.
The prognosis of primary ADT performed in
patients with prostate carcinoma is quite good, and 50%
of patients were alive after primary ADT at 10-year follow-up in a Japanese population.3 Thus, we must take
care of not only cancer control but also the patient’s bone
health based on a probably long life span for these men.

Conclusions
A single infusion of zoledronic acid increased BMD and
decreased urine NTx levels in hormone-naive patients
with prostate carcinoma. These effects were durable
within 12 months after the initiation of ADT. However,
urinary NTx returned to pretreatment levels at
12 months, and further study is needed to clarify the optimal regimen of therapy, as well as its long-term efficacy.
