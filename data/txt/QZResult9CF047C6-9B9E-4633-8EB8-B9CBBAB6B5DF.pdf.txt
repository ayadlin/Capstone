BACKGROUND: Because the efficacy and safety of pazopanib in Japanese patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) had not been
evaluated previously in a large-scale cohort, the authors investigated the efficacy and safety of pazopanib in 156 Japanese patients
with relapsed STS. This was a retrospective study based on the collection of real-life, postmarketing surveillance data. METHODS:
Patients received pazopanib with the objective of treating local recurrence (n 5 20), metastasis (n 5 104), and both (n 5 32). The
patient median age was 53.8 years. The primary objective of this study was to clarify the efficacy of pazopanib for patients with
STS. RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 28.7 weeks, and the average dose intensity of pazopanib was 609 mg. Adverse
events occurred in 127 patients (81.4%). In addition to the main common toxicities, such as hypertension and liver disorder, pneumothorax (n 5 11) and thrombocytopenia (n 5 16) also were observed. The median progression-free survival for all patients was
15.4 weeks. The median progression-free survival for patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic
sarcoma, and liposarcoma was 18.6 weeks, 16.4 weeks, 15.3 weeks, and 8 weeks, respectively. The median survival for all patients
was 11.2 months. The median survival for patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,
and liposarcoma was 20.1 months, 10.6 months, 9.5 months, and 7.3 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were apparent differences in the efficacy of pazopanib treatment among histologic types of STS. Pazopanib treatment is a new treatment option;
however, adverse events like pneumothorax and thrombocytopenia, which did not occur frequently in the PALETTE study (pazopaC 2016 The Authors. Cancer
nib for metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma), should be taken into consideration. Cancer 2016;122:1408-16. V

Pazopanib in Patients With STS/Nakamura et al

INTRODUCTION
Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a rare and heterogeneous
group of tumors that include more than 50 histologic
types.1 From 5% to 30% of patients with STS have a local
recurrence, and from 10% to 38% present with clinically
detectable metastases.2-5 The development of new systemic treatments for patients with STS has been limited
in the past few decades. Thus, the median survival of
patients with advanced STS remains >12 months.6 Pazopanib is an orally available, multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3
and against platelet-derived growth factor receptor a
(PDGFR-a), PDGFR-a, and c-kit.7 The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG), in collaboration
with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), carried out a phase 3 study
(pazopanib for metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma [PALETTE]) to evaluate the efficacy of pazopanib in patients
with STS.8 Three hundred sixty-nine patients were
randomized (2:1) to pazopanib or placebo.
The study population included 47 Japanese patients.
A significant 3-month advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in the pazopanib arm; however,
it should be noted that patients who had liposarcoma
(LPS) or some other types of STS were excluded from
enrollment.8 LPS was excluded based on results from a
phase 2 trial that did not demonstrate a sufficient benefit
from pazopanib treatment in patients with LPS.9 In 2012,
based on results from PALETTE, pazopanib was
approved in Japan for the treatment of STS. However, the
efficacy and safety of pazopanib in Japanese patients with
advanced STSs remained to be evaluated in a large-scale
cohort. In the current study, we investigated the clinical
outcomes of 156 Japanese patients who had STS of the
extremities or trunk and received treatment with pazopanib. The patients were treated by physicians from the Japanese Musculoskeletal Oncology Group (JMOG).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

We retrospectively reviewed the postmarketing surveillance (PMS) data from the PALETTE study, and an independent questionnaire was administered to JMOG
members. In Japan, PMS data have been used mainly to
verify the safety of new medicines in practical use after
they have been approved. As a requirement for its approval, a presentation of the PMS data from all patients
who had received treatment with pazopanib since
Cancer

May 1, 2016

September 2012 was required by the Ministry of Health,
Labor, and Welfare of Japan. At the cutoff date of October
27, 2014, in total, 539 patients were enrolled in the PMS
system. Each institution approved the human protocol for
this investigation, and that investigations were conducted
in conformity with the ethical principles of research.
Among the patients identified, 199 patients had
received treatment with pazopanib at 37 JMOG institutions. The inclusion criteria for the current study were as
follows: 1) the primary tumor was an STS that arose at
the extremities/trunk; and 2) patients had received pazopanib for an unresectable local recurrence and/or a metastatic lesion. In Japan, pazopanib is approved for all
histologic types of STS by the drug-regulatory authority,
because quite a few agents, including doxorubicin and
ifosfamide, are available for the treatment of STS. For
the same reason, pazopanib administration is also
allowed for patients who have no history of chemotherapy. Thus, both patients with LPS and those without a
history of chemotherapy were included in the current
study. After applying the inclusion criteria, 43 patients
were excluded from the study, and the data from 156
patients were analyzed (Fig. 1). The primary objective of
this study was to clarify the efficacy of pazopanib for the
treatment of STSs. Survival, PFS, and objective radiologic responses to pazopanib were analyzed by using a
questionnaire was administered to the JMOG members.
The best objective responses were evaluated according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1. Stable disease (SD) was defined as
a lack of disease progression for >8 weeks. This evaluation was done not on a fixed schedule but according to
local institutional standards. We also evaluated the safety
of pazopanib using the PMS data. Adverse events were
graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0. This study was approved
by the institutional review board of Mie University Hospital. Liver disorder included elevated serum levels of
aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase,
hyperbilirubinemia, and liver failure. The mean followup after initiating pazopanib treatment was 11.4 months
(range, 0.7-30.1 months).
Two abstracts/posters addressing this Japanese PMS
cohort were presented previously at the European Cancer
Congress and the Connective Tissue Oncology Society
meeting.10,11 The cohort included STSs that appeared at
all sites, such as the uterus, bladder, skin, and soft tissue.
The maximum duration of follow-up was 1 year after the
initiation of pazopanib treatment. Those analyses did not
include an evaluation of tumor response. The current

study is different from the previous studies, in that we
included only patients who had STSs of the extremities
and trunk who were treated by JMOG members, had longer follow-up data about oncologic results, and had imaging data available on the response to pazopanib.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical associations of the clinicopathologic factors
were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test (for quantitative data) and the chi-square test (for qualitative data).
The Fisher least significant difference test was used to
compare the mean duration of pazopanib treatment
between each subtype. Correlations between the duration
of pazopanib treatment and the clinical characteristics
were tested using Spearman rank-correlation analysis. A
statistically significant Spearman q value suggests a correlation in the population.
PFS was defined as the time from the initial administration of pazopanib to either the first instance of disease
progression (according to RECIST version 1.1) or death
from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the
time from the initial administration of pazopanib to the
date of either death or the last follow-up examination.
Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier
method. A univariate Cox model was used to compare
PFS and OS between patients. A multivariate analysis was
performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model. The
factors that were identified as significant in the univariate
analysis were included as variables in the multivariate
analysis. P values < .05 were considered significant in all
statistical analyses. The StatView software program (version 5.0; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to perform all statistical analyses.
1410

In total, 156 patients with STS received treatment with
pazopanib. Pazopanib was administered with the objective of treating local recurrence (n 5 20), metastasis (n 5
104), or both local recurrence and metastasis (n 5 32)
(Table 1). Lung and bone metastases developed in 113
and 32 patients, respectively. Table 1 lists the demographics and baseline characteristics of the patients. The
median patient age was 53.8 years (range, 17-88 years).
Twenty-two patients had not previously received systemic
chemotherapy for advanced disease, and 134 had previously received systemic chemotherapy. The main reason
that there was no history of chemotherapy in 22 patients
was the estimated potential for age-dependent cardiac and
renal toxicity, because they were aged >70 years.
Most patients (132 of 156; 84.6%) had a good performance status (0 or 1). The distribution according to
histologic subtype was as follows: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) (n 5 30), LMS (n 5 21), synovial sarcoma (SS) (n 5 18), dedifferentiated LPS (n 5
17), alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) (n 5 12), myxoid
LPS (n 5 11), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) (n 5 8), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) (n 5 7),
pleomorphic LPS (n 5 4), solitary fibrous tumor (n 5 3),
fibrosarcoma (n 5 2), and others (n 5 23). The primary
major tumor sites were the thigh (n 5 48) and the retroperitoneum (n 5 30).
Adverse Events

Pazopanib initially was administered orally once daily at
doses of 800 mg (n 5 112), 600 mg (n 5 12), 400 mg (n
5 15), or 200 mg (n 5 17) (Table 2). The median treatment duration was 28.7 weeks, and the average dose intensity of pazopanib was 609 mg. Adverse events occurred
in 127 patients (81.4%). Age (P 5 .78; Mann-Whitney U
test) and sex (P 5 .40; chi-square test) were not related to
the occurrence of adverse events. The main common toxicities were hypertension (n 5 60), liver disorder (n 5
38), diarrhea (n 5 35), hair hypopigmentation (n 5 22),
nausea (n 5 20), anorexia (n 5 19), fatigue (n 5 18), and
thrombocytopenia (n 5 16). Younger patients were more
likely to develop nausea and hand-foot syndrome (P 5
.04 and P 5 .02, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test),
and female patients were more likely to develop anorexia
and nausea (P 5 .02 and P 5 .003, respectively; chisquare test). Other adverse events, such as hypertension,
liver disorder, and diarrhea, were not related to age or sex.
Grade 3 adverse events were reported in 48 patients.
The main common grade 3 toxicities were hypertension

Dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions because
of the occurrence of an adverse event were required in 70
patients (48%). The mean time (6 standard error) of the
first dose reduction or treatment interruption because of
the occurrence of an adverse event was 38 6 6.2 days. The
main reasons for an interruption or reduction in pazopanib treatment were liver disorder (n 5 13), diarrhea (n 5
12), hypertension (n 5 11), thrombocytopenia (n 5 10),
and nausea (n 5 6). At the time of analysis, 11 patients
were still receiving pazopanib. Among the remaining 145
patients, treatment was terminated because of tumor progression (n 5 87), toxicity (n 5 44), or other reasons
(n 5 14). The types of toxicity that prompted treatment
discontinuation were liver disorder (n 5 9), fatigue (n 5

Tumor Responses

Among all 156 patients in the study population, an evaluable tumor response (according to RECIST) occurred in
125 patients. Thirty-one patients were excluded from this
evaluation for the following reasons: discontinuation of
treatment because of adverse events before the evaluation
(n 5 14), tumor progression before the evaluation (n 5
9), and admission to hospital for another reason (n 5 8).

which also was observed in patients with ASPS (n 5 4),
UPS (n 5 3), epithelioid sarcoma (n 5 2), SS (n 5 2), malignant granular cell tumor (n 5 1), and malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (n 5 1). Seventy-four patients
achieved SD, which was maintained for a period of >6
months (long SD) in 32 of 74 patients. Thus, a PR or long
SD was observed in 36% of the 125 patients. Histologically, a PR or long SD was achieved in patients with ASPS
(78%), LMS (44%), and SS (44%). Few patients with LPS
(14%) or MPNST (0%) achieved PR or long SD.
The median PFS for all patients was 15.4 weeks
(95% confidence interval [CI], 13-18.9 weeks) (Table 3,
Fig. 3). Age, sex, PS, treatment line, treatment target, and
primary tumor site were not significantly correlated with
PFS (data not shown). The median PFS in 33 patients
who had LPS was 8 weeks. In contrast, the median PFS in
patients who had non-LPS was 17.7 weeks. The median
PFS in patients who had LMS, SS, and UPS was 18.6
weeks, 16.4 weeks, and 15.3 weeks, respectively (Table 4).
1412

Among the 33 patients with LPS, 17 patients a dedifferentiated type, and 11 had a myxoid type. The median
PFS for these patients was 8 weeks and 8.3 weeks, respectively. The median PFS for the patients with MPNST and
MFS was 7.4 weeks and 16.7 weeks, respectively (Table 4).
Although the patients with ASPS had better PFS than those
with non-ASPS (ASPS vs non-ASPS: HR, 0.225; 95% CI,
0.091-0.052; P 5 .001), the patients with LPS or MPNST
had poorer PFS than those with non-LPS (LPS vs nonLPS: HR, 1.753; 95% CI, 1.147-2.679; P 5 .01) or nonMPNST (MPNST vs non-MPNST: HR, 2.24; 95% CI,
1.035-4.849; P 5 .03), respectively.
Finally, we divided the patients into 2 groups
according to eligibility criteria for PALETTE as far as possible. Therefore, the “PALETTE group” (n 5 63) consisted of the patients with an inclusion histology type, a
PS of 0 or 1, a history of previous chemotherapy containing an anthracycline for metastatic disease, and age 18
years. The “non-PALETTE group” (n 5 93) consisted of
patients who had at least an exclusion histology type (eg,
LPS, extraskeletal osteosarcoma), had a PS from 2 to 4,
had received pazopanib as first-line treatment, had brain
metastasis, or were aged <18 years). The median PFS for
patients in the “PALETTE group” and the “nonPALETTE group” was 13.8 weeks and 16.7 weeks (P 5
.90), respectively (Fig. 4).
OS

The median OS was 11.2 months (95% CI, 9.1-14.1
months) (Table 4, Fig. 5). At the final follow-up, pazopanib was still being received by 11 patients. One hundred
three patients died of their sarcoma. We also analyzed
the OS of patients based on their histologic subtypes

months, and 7.3 months, respectively. A Cox univariate
analysis revealed that the favorable prognostic factors in
patients who received pazopanib were a good PS, female
sex, the number of previous systemic chemotherapy lines,
and a longer duration of pazopanib treatment (Table 5).
The significance of a PS of 0 (0 vs 2-4: HR, 0.297; 95%

of previous systemic chemotherapy lines (0-1 vs 2 lines:

duration of pazopanib treatment (per day: HR, 0.995;
95% CI, 0.994-0.997; P < .0001) remained in the multivariate analysis.
There was a significant association between the duration of pazopanib treatment and PFS (Spearman q 5
0.631; P < .0001). Although 31 patients were excluded
from the multivariate analysis because of a lack of
RECIST information, a better tumor response was associated with longer survival.

and those who did not. The OS of patients in the
“PALETTE group” and “non-PALETTE group” was 11.4
months and 10.8 months (P 5 .48), respectively (Fig. 6).
Among the 145 patients who stopped pazopanib
treatment, 47 received postpazopanib treatment, which
consisted of chemotherapy in 21 patients and radiotherapy in 17 patients. The remaining 98 patients received
only best supportive care.
DISCUSSION
Pazopanib is the first antiangiogenic drug for STS that has
been approved on the basis of the PALETTE study
results.8 The median treatment duration and the relative
dose intensity of pazopanib (in the PALETTE study) were
16.4 weeks and 96%, respectively. In the current multicenter study, the median treatment duration was 28.7
weeks, and the average dose intensity of pazopanib was
609 mg. These results suggest that, although 48% of
patients required either a reduction in dose intensity or
the interruption of pazopanib treatment, the treatment

was relatively tolerable. Therefore, pazopanib is likely to
become a new treatment option for patients with STSs.
Although some patients may continue pazopanib treatment with stable disease control, they should be informed
of the exhausting symptoms, which include diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue.
In the current study, grade 3 adverse events,
including serious or fatal events, were reported in 48
patients (33%). Remarkably, pneumothorax occurred in
11 of 113 patients (9.7%) who had lung metastasis; and,
in 8 of those patients, the severity of the event was grade 3
or 4. This incidence is higher than that observed in
the PALETTE study (3%). In the current study, 72% of
156 patients had lung metastasis, which may cause pneumothorax after pazopanib administration. Verschoor and
Gelderblom reported that 6 of 43 patients (14%) with
lung metastasis who received pazopanib developed pneumothorax.12 It is difficult to compare that study directly
with the PALETTE trial, because the proportion of
patients with lung metastasis was not described in the
PALETTE study. However, patients should be informed
of the risk of pneumothorax before the administration of
pazopanib. Thrombocytopenia is another adverse event
that is worthy of discussion. Thrombocytopenia was
observed in 16 patients (10%); and, in 4 of those patients,
the severity was grade 3. Moreover, an interruption or
reduction of pazopanib was required in 10 patients
because of thrombocytopenia. Nakano et al reported that
28% of Japanese patients with STS (13 of 47 patients)
developed grade 1 or 2 thrombocytopenia, although there
were no patients who required an interruption or reduction of pazopanib treatment.13 Physicians should be alert
to the occurrence of pneumothorax and thrombocytopenia as well as other well known adverse events.

Figure 6. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate overall survival for all
156 patients divided into 2 groups according to eligibility criteria for the PALETTE study (pazopanib for metastatic softtissue sarcoma) as far as possible. Line A indicates the PALETTE group; line B, the non-PALETTE group.

Radiologic evaluations using RECIST indicated that
13 patients achieved PR and that 32 of 74 patients
achieved long SD. From 35% to 78% of patients with
ASPS, UPS, LMS, and SS achieved a PR or long SD. The
patients with LPS and MPNST had a poorer response to
pazopanib. Furthermore, the median PFS in patients with
LPS and MPNST was 8 weeks and 7.4 weeks, respectively. The median PFS in all patients was 15.4 weeks.
This result was poorer than that reported in the PALETTE study (4.6 months for the pazopanib group). The
short PFS in our patients with LPS may have affected the
results, because the PALETTE study excluded LPS.
Actually, the median PFS for patients with non-LPS sarcoma was 17.7 weeks in the current study, which is almost
identical to data from the PALETTE study. Furthermore,
we compared PFS and OS between the PALETTE and
non-PALETTE groups, and there was no significant difference between them. Although there were only 2
patients with epithelioid sarcoma, the best response that
was achieved in such patients was a PR. Patients who had
LMS, SS, ASPS, and vascular tumors reportedly were the
main long-term responders and survivors.13,14 In particular, the activity of antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, and cediranib, was reported previously in
ASPS.15-17 In addition to these tumors, we suggest that
pazopanib may have the potential to allow patients with
UPS and epithelioid sarcoma to achieve long SD and that
there is less potential to achieve long SD in patients with
LPS and MPNST. Our results concerning LPS support
the findings of the EORTC phase 2 study, which did not
demonstrate a sufficient benefit from pazopanib

treatment in patients with LPS.9 These results suggest that
the indications for pazopanib should be carefully decided.
We also demonstrated that the duration of pazopanib treatment was significantly associated with PFS and
that a longer duration of pazopanib administration was
associated with a longer OS. However, in patients who
have progressive disease, all available systemic treatments
should be considered after pazopanib is discontinued,
because 32% of the patients in this study received postpazopanib treatment.
The median survival of 11.2 months is in line with
findings from the PALETTE study (12.5 months in the
pazopanib group).8 A good PS and female sex also were
favorable prognostic factors for OS. Kasper et al reported
that a good PS and a normal hemoglobin level were favorable factors for long-term survival (OS, 18 months).14
Sex and soluble VEGFR2 and placental-derived growth
factor levels at week 12 also reportedly were identified as
prognostic factors.18,19 In addition to histologic diagnosis, these clinical factors should be taken into account
when deciding the indications for pazopanib treatment.
However, more international research will be required to
precisely identify the prognostic factors that are associated
with survival.
The current study was associated with some limitations. The study population was relatively small for considering the relation between different histologic tumors
and clinical outcomes. Also, the study was retrospective in
nature. It may be difficult to compare this study directly
with previous phase 29 and 38 trials because of differences
according tumor subtype in inclusion criteria, eligibility
criteria, and follow-up procedures. For example, in the
previous study, the scheduled time points for tumor evaluations were fixed according to RECIST. In the current
study, the time points depended on the physician. Moreover, although the median PFS was 15.4 weeks, the median pazopanib treatment duration was 28.7 weeks. The
may be because pazopanib treatment was continued
depending on the physician’s decision despite disease
progression.
In conclusion, there were apparent differences in the
radiographic efficacy of pazopanib treatment among the
histologic types of STS. A PR or long SD may be expected
in patients with ASPS, LMS, SS, and UPS who receive
pazopanib. Pazopanib treatment is a new, tolerable treatment option; however, adverse events, such as pneumothorax and thrombocytopenia, which did not occur
frequently in the PALETTE study, should be taken into
consideration.
