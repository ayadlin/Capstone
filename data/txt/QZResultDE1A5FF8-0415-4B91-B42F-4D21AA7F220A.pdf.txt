Abstract
Acoustic liposomes (AL) have their inherent echogenicity and can add functionality in serving as drug carriers
with tissue speciﬁcity. Nonuniform vascular structures and vascular branches/bends are evaluated by imaging the
intravascular movement locus of ALs with high-frequency ultrasound (HF-US) imaging. However, the evaluation
of antitumor effects on angiogenesis by ALs and HF-US imaging has not been reported. Here, we show that the
combination of ALs and an HF-US imaging system is capable of noninvasively evaluating antitumor volumetric
and angiogenic effects in preclinical mouse models of various cancers. In this study, the antitumor effects of
cisplatin on tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice bearing two different types of tumor cells were assessed. By
tracking each AL ﬂowing in the vessel and transferring the images to personal computers, microvessel structures
were mapped and reconstructed using the color difference based on SD method. The antitumor effects were
conﬁrmed with an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system and immunohistochemical analysis. Our results show
that cisplatin inhibits tumor growth by decreasing intratumoral vessel area but does not affect the angiogenesis
ratio in the tumor. The vascular occupancy in the outer region of the tumor was larger than that in the inner
region; however, both occupancies were similar to those of the control tumor. We propose that this method of
mapping microvessels with ALs and an HF-US system can serve as a new molecular imaging method for the
assessment of angiogenesis and can be applied to evaluate the antitumor effects by various therapeutic agents.

Introduction
With the development of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA),
contrast-enhanced ultrasound can image blood perfusion in
organs and measure blood ﬂow rate in the heart and other
organs, thereby facilitating the detection of primary and metastatic cancer (1, 2). Acoustic liposomes (AL) are one kind of
UCA and can add functionality along with echogenicity, serving as drug carriers with tissue speciﬁcity (3–6). When their
diameter is reduced to 100 to 200 nm, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (7) can be exploited, creating
the possibility of using high-frequency ultrasound (HF-US) to
evaluate vascular permeability, vascular number, and vascular
occupancy by their extravascular US imaging properties. In
addition, tumor-targeting chemotherapy can be achieved by
collapsing extravascularized ALs with US, that is, sonoporation
(4, 6, 8). However, the in vivo lifetime of ALs is relatively short
compared with that of commercially available UCAs, thus the

angiogenic evaluation of antitumor effects with ALs and HF-US
imaging has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated
tumor volume and vascular area in tumors with and without
intratumoral injection of cisplatin (CDDP). Tumors after
injected intravenously with ALs were imaged by a HF-US
system. Images were evaluated using the color difference based
on SD (CDSD) method (9). We found that CDDP induced
cytoreductive effects but did not affect the angiogenesis ratio
in the tumor. The vascular occupancy in the outer region of the
tumor was larger than that in the inner region; however, both
occupancies were similar to those of the control tumor (saline
injection). The results indicate that CDDP may not inhibit
angiogenesis speciﬁcally. We propose that this microvessel
mapping system can serve as a new molecular imaging method
for assessing the effects of therapy on angiogenesis.

Materials and Methods
In vivo studies were done in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of Tohoku University.

The ALs were prepared as described previously (3, 10). The
shell composition was 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC; NOF Co.) and N- (carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol-2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE-PEG2000-Ome; PEG molecular weight, 2,000;

was calculated to be 3.3  1012 bubbles/mL (6). The peak
diameter of the number distribution was 0.20  0.08 mm and
the zeta potential was 2.40  0.51 mV. Approximately 20% of
the ALs contained both liquid and gas, whereas approximately
80% contained liquid alone (i.e., nonacoustic; ref. 6).
Tumor cell culture
Murine colon carcinoma (Colon26) cells were obtained from
the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of
Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, on March
28, 2006. Murine mammary carcinoma (EMT6) cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection on December
4, 2008. Colon26-Luc and EMT6-Luc cells stably expressing of
the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene were prepared by Transfection of
Colon26 and EMT6 cells with pEGFP (BD Bioscience) using
Lipofection Transfer Reagent (Invitrogen), respectively (11).
Colon26 and EMT6 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
and Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Colon26-Luc and EMT6-Luc cells were cultured in each
medium added with Geneticin (G418 sulfate; Sigma-Aldrich;
1 mg/mL), respectively. Cells were incubated at 37 C in a
mixture of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air until 80% conﬂuence
was achieved. Cells were routinely veriﬁed by morphology and
growth characteristics using Trypan blue. Cells were tested for
Mycoplasma contamination on the day of the inoculation, day
0, using MycoAlaert Mycoplasma Detection Kit according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Mycoplasma-negative cells were
used for this study.
Tumor model
Colon26, Colon26-Luc, or EMT6-Luc cells were suspended in
PBS without Mg2þ and Ca2þ (PBS). To form solid tumors, 1  107
cells/mL of 100 mL was injected intradermally into the right and
left ﬂanks of severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice
(age 6–8 weeks, weight 20–25 g) or BALB/c mice (age 9 weeks,
weight 25–27 g), in which the ﬂanks to be injected were depilated
with commercial hair removal cream. Colon26 cells were used
for the BALB/c mice and Colon26-Luc and EMT6-Luc cells were
used for the SCID mice. The day of inoculation was deﬁned as
day 0. Tumors were allowed to grow to a diameter of 10 to 15
mm, which was normally attained in 15 to 16 days.
CDDP treatment
For the treated groups, a total of 40 mL CDDP (molecular
weight 300, 10 mg/20 mL, Nihon Kayaku Co.) and 60 mL PBS, that
is, CDDP of 2 mg/g body weight, was injected in each solid tumor
on days 4, 8, and 11 for the EMT6-Luc cells and on days 7, 12, and
15 for the Colon26-Luc cells. In the control group, 100 mL of PBS
was injected intratumorally under the same conditions as for the
treatment group (12). For the EMT6-Luc cells, tumor-bearing
mice in the treatment group numbered n ¼ 21, and in the
control group, n ¼ 12. For Colon26-Luc tumor-bearing mice in
the treatment, n ¼ 9, and in the control group, n ¼ 9.
Tumor growth assessment
Two methods, an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system
and the HF-US imaging system, were used for tumor growth

assessment on day 4 (n ¼ 12 for control, n ¼ 9 for treatment),
day 8 (n ¼ 9 for control, n ¼ 9 for treatment), day 11 (n ¼ 6 for
control, n ¼ 6 for treatment), and day 15 (n ¼ 3 for control, n ¼
3 for treatment) for the EMT6-Luc cells, and on day 4 (n ¼ 9 for
control, n ¼ 9 for treatment), day 7 (n ¼ 9 for control, n ¼ 9 for
treatment), day 12 (n ¼ 6 for control, n ¼ 6 for treatment) and
day 15 (n ¼ 3 for control, n ¼ 3 for treatment) for the Colon26Luc cells. With the bioluminescence imaging method, the
luminescence intensities were assessed with the in vivo imaging system, IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life Science Inc.; refs. 6, 12).
With the HF-US imaging method, B-mode images were
acquired with the Vevo 770 system (VisualSonics Inc.) under
room temperature of 22 C to 26 C. The scanner was equipped
with a mechanical single element transducer (RMV-704, central frequency 40 MHz, axial resolution 40 mm, lateral resolution 80 mm, slice thickness resolution 40 mm, focal depth 6 mm,
and length of ﬁeld 1.5 mm). The transducer was ﬁxed with a 3dimensional (3D) stage control system (mark-204-MS; Sigma
Koki). Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane (Abbott
Japan Co., Ltd.) and placed on a stage maintained at 38 C
(TM150, VisualSonics Inc.). To maintain US transmission, US
gel (Parker Laboratories Inc.) was placed on the tumor formed
in the ﬂank. In the tumor images, linear measurements were
made across each axis to measure the length, width, and depth
of the tumor. The center of the tumor was set at the focal
length. 2D/3D images of the tumor were constructed by Bmode images. 2D B-mode images at the center of the longitudinal length were acquired at 30 frames/sec for 10 seconds,
that is, the obtained cineloops consisted of 300 frames. The
consecutive B-mode images acquired with a slice thickness of
100 mm, scanning across the tumor by the computer-controlled
3D motorized stage, were reconstructed into a 3D image, and
the volume consisting of multiple polygons was calculated with
the Vevo 770 software.
Evaluation of time-dependent changes in grayscale
intensity in tumors
Time-dependent changes in the grayscale intensity of mouse
solid tumors were investigated. With the HF-US imaging
method, B-mode images were acquired at the center of tumors
using the HF-US imaging system with a 40 MHz transducer
on day 8, as described in the previous section. ALs were used
as an US contrast agent and were prepared 1 minute before
each injection, as previously described. Colon26 tumor-bearing
mice (n ¼ 4) were given bolus intravenous injection of ALs
(lipid concentration: 1 mg/mL) via the tail vein for a total
volume of 100 mL. B-mode images were acquired from approximately 5 seconds before AL injection. The tumor grayscale
intensities in each frame were calculated using the HF-US
system software.
Reconstruction of intratumoral microvasculatures
using ALs
The 2D images of intratumoral microvasculature were
reconstructed in only one solid tumor per mouse on day 5
(n ¼ 9 for control, n ¼ 9 for treatment), day 9 (n ¼ 3 for
control, n ¼ 3 for treatment), day 12 (n ¼ 6 for control, n ¼ 6
for treatment), and day 15 (n ¼ 3 for control, n ¼ 3 for

Immunohistochemical analysis
The solid tumors that were used for the vessel map
construction as described above were then excised. The
blocks used for immunohistochemical staining were ﬁxed
in 4% neutral buffered formalin (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries) for 2 to 3 days at 4 C, embedded with Paraplast
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc K.K.), sectioned into 3 to 3.5 mm
sections, and deparafﬁnized with the Tissue clear (Sakura
Finetck Japan Co., Ltd.). CD31-positive endothelial cells were
stained with anti-mouse CD31 rabbit polyclonal antibody
as a primary antibody (dilution with 1% bovine serum
albumin in PBS solution, 1:50; Abcam plc.). A peroxidase
conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Nichirei) was used as a
secondary antibody. The sections were stained with
0.04% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% 30 ,30 -diaminobenzidine
(Ventana Japan K.K). The hotspot method was used for
calculating the vascular ratio (15, 16). First the tumor
boundary was extracted under a microscope (BX51; Olympus) with a digital camera (DP72; Olympus) at a low magniﬁcation (40 or 100), as shown in Fig. 4A. Next, the
boundary was reduced by half, and the inner and other
regions were deﬁned as Ac and Ao, respectively. Each region
was divided into 4 subregions. In Ac region, the mean
vascular density was calculated by dividing the vascular
total area, consisting of vasculatures with a minor axis of
7 to 50 mm (200), by the CD31-positive hotspot area
(430 mm  330 mm). Similarly, the mean vascular density
in Ao was calculated. The vascular density measurement was
done by 2 persons to reduce measurement error.

Statistical analysis
All measurements are expressed as mean  SEM. Any overall
difference between the groups was determined by 1-way
ANOVA. Simple comparisons of the independence of data of
2 groups were done using Student t test or Aspin–Welch t test.
Normally distributed equal variables were compared by the
Student t test, and normally distributed unequal variables were
compared by Aspin-Welch t test. Nonnormally distributed
variables were compared by the Mann–Whitney U test. The
differences were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

control, n ¼ 3 for treatment), day 13 (n ¼ 3 for control, n ¼ 3
for treatment), and day 16 (n ¼ 3 for control, n ¼ 3 for
treatment) for the Colon26-Luc cells. The lifetime of the ALs
was maintained to about 6 minutes after intravenous injection. The B-mode images of the tumor were obtained with
the HF-US imaging system between 20 and 90 seconds (i.e.,
diagnostic window) after ALs injection. A B-mode image
consisting of 300 frames (434MB in AVI format), with a
frame interval of 100 mm, was divided into 300 individual
frames in BMP format (423 MB) with a video encoding
software (TMPGEnc Free Version; Pegasys Inc.). Each image
was transferred to a computer system (SGI Altix 3700 B  2;
SGI Japan) at the Advanced Fluid Information Research
Center, Institute of Fluid Science, Tohoku University and
analyzed to construct maps of 2D microvasculature by using
the CDSD method (9). In the CDSD method, the lumen of a
blood vessel is recognized by detecting an instantaneous
increase of brightness due to ALs passing through the vessel,
with a threshold value deﬁned by the time-average and the
SD of the brightness. Compared with the conventional
visualization method (13), this approach is capable of visualizing vascular regions by suppressing the effects of noise
and tissue movement in US B-mode measurements. The
differences in image brightness between pre- and postinjection of the ALs were displayed using ImageJ software (14).
The image was binarized to enhance the vascular structure.
One scan per solid tumor was done.

Results

A

Time–intensity relation of ALs in tumors and
constructed vascular images by ALs, HF-US image
system, and the CDSD method
To determine the optimal diagnostic window allowed to
capture vascular imaging in the presence of ALs, we investigated the time–intensity relation of B-mode images of tumors
injected with ALs. Figure 2A shows a representative time–
intensity relation in tumors of Colon26 on day 8 in the absence
of CDDP. Immediately after the AL tail vein injection, the mean
grayscale value increased dramatically and then decreased
gradually to the background level within 6 minutes. The
half-life of ALs in vivo was 84  12 seconds (n ¼ 4). The
vasculatures were clearly constructed between 20 and 90
seconds after tail vein injection of ALs. In the following
experiments, the optimal diagnostic window allowed to capture all HF-US images was set between these times. Figure 2B
shows representative 2D images of the Colon26-Luc tumor
on day 8 without CDDP treatment (control). The intratumoral
vasculatures were constructed by ALs, the HF-US image
system and the CDSD method. Figure 2Ba and c show a
B-mode image of tumor before AL injection and its corresponding extracted 2D vascular structures, respectively. Figure
2Bb and d indicate that of tumor after AL injection and its
extracted 2D vascular structures, respectively. Although Fig.

Evaluation of CDDP-induced cytoreductive effect with
the HF-US imaging system and the bioluminescence
imaging system
The CDDP-induced cytoreductive effects were assessed by
using the HF-US imaging system and bioluminescence imaging
system up to 15 days postimplantation of tumor cells (Fig. 1).
We measured the minimum volume Vmin ¼ 3.3 mm3 (using
volume ¼ pDe3/6, in which De ¼ equivalent diameter of a
sphere with the same volume, and De ¼ 1.8 mm) to the
maximum volume Vmax ¼ 153 mm3 (De ¼ 6.6mm) for the
EMT6-Luc tumor (Fig. 1B), whereas for the Colon26-Luc
tumor, Vmin ranged from 4.8 mm3 (De ¼ 2.1mm) to Vmax ¼
320 mm3 (De ¼ 8.5 mm; Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the
EMT6-Luc tumor volumes (Fig. 1B, open circle) and the
luciferase activities (white bar) increased in the control group
over time; however, they were inhibited in the CDDP treatment
group (solid circle, volume; gray bar, luciferase activity). On
days 11 and 15, the mean volumes of the treatment groups were
signiﬁcantly lower than those of the control groups (P < 0.01,
Aspin–Welch t test). Also, on days 8, 11, and 15, the mean
luciferase activities of the treatment groups were signiﬁcantly
lower than those of the control groups (P < 0.01, Aspin–Welch
t test). For the Colon26-Luc tumors (Fig. 1C), the tumor growth
was suppressed by the treatments. However, the cytoreductive
effects were lower than in the EMT6-Luc tumor; that is, for the
EMT6-Luc tumor, the mean volume and the luciferase activity
of the treatment group on day 15 decreased by approximately
1/10th compared with that of the control group. However, in
the Colon26-Luc tumors, by day 15, the mean volume and the
luciferase activity of the CDDP treatment group decreased by
only 60% and 70% of those in the control group, respectively.

(TA) and vessel area (VA) in EMT6-luc tumor: In the control groups, TA (open circle) and VA (open square) increased over 15 days. However, in the treatment
group, TA (solid circle) and VA (solid square) were constant at lower levels over the same period. Signiﬁcant differences in TA and VA between the control and
treatment groups were found on days 12 and 15 (TA; P < 0.05, Student t test, VA; P < 0.05, Student t test). B, change of the tumor area (TA) and vessel area (VA)
in Colon26-Luc tumor: In the control groups, TA (open triangle) and VA (open rhombus) increased until day 13 and thereafter saturated, whereas in the
treatment group, the growth of TA (solid triangle) and VA (solid rhombus) was suppressed until day 13, then increased. Signiﬁcant differences in TA and VA

normalized vessel ratio over the experiment period (1-way ANOVA).

area (CDDP VA) were restricted with CDDP treatments, in
which TA is the internal area that is deﬁned by the circumference of the solid tumor in B-mode image and VA is the area
occupied by vessel in the TA extracted by the CDSD method.
Therefore, both TA and VA have unit. The extent of suppression in the EMT6-Luc tumor was larger than in the Colon26Luc tumor. Signiﬁcant differences between the control and
treatment group for the EMT6-Luc tumors were observed on
days 12 and 15 (P < 0.05, Student t test), whereas they were
detected on day 13 for Colon26-Luc tumors (P < 0.05, Student t
test). Figure 3C shows the relation between the normalized
vessel area in the CDDP-treated tumor and the number of days
after inoculation, in which (normalized vessel area) ¼ [(CDDP
VA)/(CDDP TA)]/[(Cont. VA)/(Cont. TA)]. For the EMT6-Luc
tumors, the vessel ratio decreased slightly on days 9 and 15, but
there was no signiﬁcant difference over 15 days (1-way
ANOVA). Similarly, the Colon26-Luc tumors show no signiﬁcant difference over the same time period (1-way ANOVA).

Although CDDP contributed to inhibition of tumor growth,
these results indicate that the intratumoral vessel ratios in
both tumors were constant; that is, the ratio is independent of

Next, we investigated the change of the vessel ratio in the
inner and outer regions of the Colon26-Luc tumor. Figure 4A
shows an image that was binarized to enhance the vascular
structure based on Fig. 2Bd. The tumor area was divided into
inner and outer areas. Similarly, the immunohistochemical
slides were divided into inner and outer areas. The endothelialspeciﬁc antigen CD31-positive cells in the inner and outer
areas are shown in Fig. 4C and D, respectively.

Figure 5A shows the vascular ratio in the inner and outer
regions with and without CDDP treatments on days 8, 13, and
16, obtained by 2D US images. The vessel ratios of the outer
region were about double those of the inner region on all days
in both the control and treatment groups. Figure 5B shows the
vascular ratio obtained by immunohistochemical analysis.
Similarly, the vessel ratio of the outer region was about double
that of the inner region on all days, although the inner vessel
ratios on day 13 were decreased compared with the ratios on
day 8. The vascular ratio obtained by AL, the HF-US imaging
system, and the CDSD method (Fig. 5A) was about 10 times
higher than the ratio obtained by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst article on the assessment
of effects on tumor volume and angiogenesis by CDDP by using
ALs, a HF-US system, and the CDSD method. Because the in
vivo half-life of ALs with a mean diameter of 200 nm is less than
90 seconds (Fig. 2), enough amount of ALs may not leak out to
the vascular space by the EPR effect within the short limited
period time and thus ALs may not be used as pure EPR tracers.
In case of mice bearing sarcoma 180 tumor, within 10 minutes
radioiodinated N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide copolymers of MW ranging from 4.5 k to 800 k were accumulated
effectively in the tumor (17). Therefore, development of longcirculating liposomes with a life time more than at least 10
minutes may be desired to reveal the EPR effect (3). Previously,
angiogenesis has been evaluated by US backscatter images

(18, 19). The simplest model of acoustic scattering from small
particles is described by Rayleigh's model (20). When the
particle diameter, d is much smaller than the wavelength of
the sound, the scattering cross section, s S increases by frequency, f to the 4th power, and by d to the 6th power. However,
Rayleigh's model is not suitable for calculating the scatter of
sound from a single bubble because it ignores resonance.
Following a scattering model based on a linear bubble equation, s S increases by f 4 for frequencies well below resonance,
whereas s S is independent of the frequency, for frequency
above resonance. For diameters smaller than the resonance
diameter, s S increases to the 6th power of the diameter, s S /
d 6. For diameters larger than the resonance diameter, s S / d2
(21, 22). Assuming that ALs are free bubbles and their mean
diameter is 200 nm, the natural frequency was calculated to be
27 MHz (23). This frequency is on the same order as that used in
the present experiment, that is, a central frequency of 40 MHz
with an axial resolution of 40 mm. The calculated scattering
cross section is 0.03 mm2, which is emitted by a single bubble
with a diameter of 200 nm. Because the bubble size is within the

spatial resolution of the US system, the single bubble cannot be
visualized. Thus, the intratumoral vascular images observed in
the experiment might be the result of scattering of AL aggregation, ALs with larger sizes that cannot be eliminated from AL
production process, or the oscillation of ALs at around 27 MHz.
The main function of CDDP is to damage DNA and induce
apoptosis (24, 25). Although CDDP is not thought to inhibit
angiogenesis speciﬁcally, some researchers have reported that
CDDP provided antiangiogenic effects against several human
and mouse cancer cells, including Colon26 carcinoma (26, 27).
In addition, the larger vessels in the outer area of tumor are less
affected by the antiangiogenic therapy, but small vessels
perfused in the tumor are more sensitive to the therapy
(1, 28, 29). It is believed that this effect depends on the
accessibility of drugs to the endothelial cells in each vessel.
In other words, most large vessels were stabilized by smooth
muscle actin-positive cells, but immature small vessels in the
tumor lacked coverage by smooth muscle cells and pericytes
(29, 30). In the present experiment, both the tumor volume and
the luciferase activities of murine mammary carcinoma EMT6Luc tumor and murine colon carcinoma Colon26-Luc tumor
were suppressed by about 1/10th and two-thirds of each
control group by intratumoral injection of CDDP 3 times,
respectively (Fig. 1). Because the vessel ratios of the inner and
outer regions have similar values to those of the controls,
CDDP may not inhibit angiogenesis speciﬁcally (Fig. 5). In the
rapid growth phase of solid tumors, enhanced permeability of
the neovascularity and limited lymphatic drainage was
induced, resulting in the accumulation of ﬂuid in the central
tumor region, followed by an increase in the interstitial ﬂuid
pressure. The increased pressure constricts the vessels and
decreases blood ﬂow in the central regions (30, 31), leading to a
decrease in the vessel ratio in the inner region rather than in
the outer region (Fig. 5). The vessel ratio obtained by using ALs,
the HF-US imaging system and the CDSD method (Fig. 5A) is 10
times higher than that of the value obtained by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 5B). The difference is caused by
multiple factors: (a) the vessel area was expanded owing to
the US scattering effect; and (b) the slice thickness resolution of
the HF-US is 40 mm, whereas the thickness of the parafﬁn slides
was 3 to 3.5 mm. Therefore, vascular information of US images
should be 10 times more than the parafﬁn, and (c) the hotspot
analysis was applied to an area of high vascular density within a
tissue slide and not to the whole area of the slide (16).
Therefore, vascular images obtained by ALs, the HF-US imaging system, and the CDSD method have ill-deﬁned borders,

which are not consistent with the vascular structures obtained
by immunohistochemical analysis (32). Conventional noncontrast-enhanced Doppler US has been applied successfully to
monitor antiangiogenic therapies; however, it is relatively
insensitive to slow blood ﬂow velocities and capillary blood
ﬂow in small nonstabilized vessels (28), which mostly respond
to antiangiogenic treatments (33, 34). Recently, high-frequency
volumetric power Doppler ultrasound (HF-VPDU; ref. 31) and
contrast-enhanced HF-VPDU (1) have been investigated to
assess antiangiogenic therapy effects. Ultrasound microbubble
contrast agents that have been used in clinic are pure intravascular probes (35). They have the potential to target diseaserelated cellular and molecular process within the vascular
compartment (35). Although ALs are one of several kinds of
UCAs, they can encapsulate gas and liquid, thereby being used
as drug carriers as well as contrast agents. In addition, ALs can
potentially be used to evaluate EPR effects and can be used for
molecular delivery of agents under US guidance (6).
In conclusion, the use of ALs and HF-US in combination with
the CDSD method has the potential to accurately and noninvasively assess the efﬁcacy of therapies designed to target
tumor growth and angiogenesis. In the future, the present
method may be used as a new molecular imaging method for
assessing angiogenesis, and it can be applied to evaluate
antitumor effects by various therapeutic agents.
