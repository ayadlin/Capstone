BACKGROUND. Metronomic chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be of value
in patients with advanced breast cancer. No reliable markers of response are
available. In breast tumor, HER-2/neu is a prognostic factor, whereas no definite
data exist for EGFR. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of serum HER-2/neu and serum EGFR in breast cancer patients treated with low-dose chemotherapy.

METHODS. Serum levels of HER-2/neu (n 5 135) and of EGFR (n 5 113) were
prospectively determined before the start of chemotherapy, after 2 months of
treatment, and when progressive disease was diagnosed.

RESULTS. Elevated ([15 ng/mL) serum HER-2/neu before the start of chemother1

apy was not associated with response rate, whereas elevated serum HER-2/neu at

T

he importance of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor family in
the development of human cancers is well documented and their
co-operation has been observed during oncogenic transformation.1
In breast cancers, particular attention has been given to Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor 1 (EGFR) and 2 (HER-2/neu), whose activation provides tumor cells with a potent growth stimulus, and could
lead to the activation of several intracellular pathways, such as the
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Akt pathway, and the phospholipase Cg
(PLC-g) pathway,2 ultimately affecting cell proliferation, survival, motility, and adhesion.

HER-2/neu gene amplification and/or protein
overexpression is found in 20% to 30% of invasive
breast cancers and it has been associated with more
aggressive disease and with a lower rate of diseasefree survival.3 In terms of the percentage of breast
cancer overexpressing EGFR and its prognostic value,
no definite conclusions exist.4–6
The extracellular ligand-domains of EFGR and
HER-2/neu can be detected in the bloodstream.
Increased serum HER-2/neu may be found in approximately 46% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.7
Many reports have associated increased serum HER2/neu concentration with earlier disease recurrence
and shortened overall survival (OS),8–10 decreased
response to chemotherapy11–14 and hormonal therapy,15 and prediction of response to trastuzumabbased treatments.16–19
As far as the potential role of serum EGFR is concerned, few data are available and the conclusions are
discordant.20–23
Low-dose ‘‘metronomic’’ chemotherapy has been
demonstrated to be of value in patients with advanced
breast cancer.24,25 Metronomic therapy can induce
objective remissions as well as prolonged disease stabilization, but no reliable markers predictive of activity and outcome are available. In a previous pilot
study26 we demonstrated that elevated levels of HER2/neu identified patients with a lower likelihood of
response to metronomic therapy.
Looking for new tools that may enable the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from
metronomic therapy, we prospectively studied the
association of serum HER-2/neu and serum EGFR
with disease response and survival in metastatic
breast cancer patients treated with low-dose chemotherapy. In addition, HER-2/neu levels during treatment were examined to evaluate the potential use of
HER-2/neu as a parameter to monitor response to
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Trial Design and Treatments
Patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled
in a phase 3 study of metronomic chemotherapy.25
The trial included patients with histologically confirmed metastatic breast carcinoma, whether pretreated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease or
not. Each patient included in the study provided
written informed consent. The protocol was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Boards.
Patients were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide orally at a dose of 50 mg daily (9 AM) and
methotrexate orally at a dose of 2.5 mg twice a day

on Days 1 and 4 every week (10 AM, 5 PM) (Arm A) or
the same treatment plus thalidomide administered
orally at a dose of 200 mg daily (9 PM) (Arm B).
Assessment of response was performed every 8 weeks
of treatment according to WHO criteria.

Sample Collection, Serum HER-2/neu, and
EGFR Determination
Serum levels of HER-2/neu and of EGFR were determined at baseline and after 2 months of treatment.
Samples were aliquoted and stored at 2808C until
use.
Serum HER-2/neu was measured with the Bayer
Immuno1 automated analyzer. The assay is based on
2 monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu antigen.27 A serum
concentration of 15 ng/mL was considered the upper
limit of normal.28
Serum EGFR concentrations were determined
using the Oncogene Science EGFR Microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a sandwich immunoassay with a mouse monoclonal capture
antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled mouse
monoclonal antibody as detector. Both capture and
detector reagents specifically recognize the extracellular domain of EGFR. The capture antibody recognizes a protein domain on the extracellular portion
of EGFR and is immobilized on the interior surface
of the microtiter plate well. To perform the test an
appropriate volume of specimen is incubated in the
well to allow binding of the antigen by the capture
antibody. The immobilized antigen is then exposed
to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled detector antibody. Addition of the substrate to the wells allows
the catalysis of a chromogen into a colored product,
the intensity of which is proportional to the amount
of EGFR. As a control group we tested 38 healthy
women: mean serum EGFR values were 58.4 ng/mL
(standard deviation [SD], 7.3; range 45.4–75.0).
Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel chisquare test for trend were used to assess the association between categorical and ordinal variables and
the level of circulating HER-2/neu at different points.
We used a cutoff of 15 ng/mL to distinguish between
elevated and nonelevated HER-2/neu levels. This cutoff (mean 1 2 SD) was derived from the sera of 242
healthy women.28 We also evaluated the modulation
(increase vs decrease) of circulating HER-2/neu
between measures at baseline and at 2 months taking into consideration also the percentage change of
HER-2/neu concentration (<20% vs 20%). When
assessing the association between circulating HER-2/

EGFR and HER2 in Metastatic Breast CA/Sandri et al.

neu and response to therapy, we evaluated the clinical response at 2 months, classifying patients as
responders (RD), with stable disease (SD) or with
progressive disease (PD). We also evaluated the association between HER-2/neu and ‘‘clinical benefit’’
defined as complete response, partial response, or
stable disease for at least 24 weeks. Survival plots
were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method. The
log-rank test and proportional hazards regression
were used to compare the survival curves. All calculations were performed using the SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All tests were 2-sided.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
was used to assess the independent prognostic significance of various clinical and histopathologic
characteristics of the tumor on progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Factors included in multiple
regression analyses were progressive disease at entry,
baseline performance status, number of metastatic
sites, site of metastasis, tumor size, ER and PgR
expression, Ki67 expression, HER2/neu overexpression, pTN classification at the time of primary tumor,
serum EGFR at baseline and at 2 months, serum
HER2/neu at baseline and 2 months, and decrease or
increase 20% of HER-2/neu between baseline and
2 months, serum calcium (CA) 15.3 at baseline and
2 months, and the percentage change (<20% vs
20%). In multivariate analysis, only variables that
retained statistical significance were included in the
final model.

RESULTS
Serum HER-2/neu
Among 178 patients who entered the study between
June 2000 and November 2003, 135 had serum HER2/neu measured at baseline and 112 after 2 months.
There were no statistically significant differences in
response rate and clinical benefit,25 nor in diseasefree or overall survival between the 2 arms of treatment. As expected, no differences were found in
terms of PFS and OS between the 2 arms of treatments; therefore, the 2 groups were analyzed as a
single cohort.
The main characteristics of patients and their
association with the baseline levels of serum HER-2/
neu are shown in Table 1. Serum HER-2/neu mean
baseline level was 16.8 ng/mL (19.5) (range, 5.9–
150.9). Increased concentration of HER-2/neu at
baseline was significantly associated with the presence of liver metastasis, with HER-2/neu overexpression in the primary tumor and with elevated
levels of CA 15.3. The response rate among patients
with low levels and patients with high levels did not

show any statistically significant difference (Table 2)
when considering both the clinical evaluation performed at 2 months and that during the follow-up.
The levels of HER-2/neu remained stable in patients
RD or SD at 2 months (RD, baseline 12.3 ng/
mL  5.1, 2 months 11.7 ng/mL  4.5, P 5 NS; SD,
baseline 14.2 ng/mL  14.4, 2 months 14.5 ng/
mL  14.3, P 5 NS), whereas they increased significantly in patients with PD (baseline 20.7 ng/
mL  28.3, 2 months 41.3 ng/mL  80.5, P 5 .045).
Serum levels of HER-2/neu measured at 2 months
were significantly associated with the response, not
only concomitantly evaluated, but also with long-term
clinical benefit (24 weeks, P < .001) (Table 2). Blood
samples at 2 months were available for 112 out of 135
patients. Twenty-three samples were missed. Among
these, 3 patients died, 4 out of 14 with high baseline
serum HER2/neu had a clinical benefit, against none
of the 6 patients with baseline serum HER2/neu 15
ng/mL.
We analyzed the association between the variation of HER-2/neu concentration (baseline and
2 months) and the response to therapy (Table 3).
Looking at the clinical evaluation performed at
2 months, only 7 (14.0%) of the 50 patients with
decreasing levels showed progression of the disease,

whereas 25 (40.3%) of the 62 patients with increasing
levels did not respond to therapy (P 5 .0071). The 2
groups of patients with increasing or decreasing serum HER-2/neu concentrations were then analyzed
taking into consideration both the 2-month HER-2/
neu value (15 ng/mL vs >15 ng/mL) and the percentage change of HER-2/neu concentration (<20%
vs 20%): this percentage change was chosen
because the value of HER2/neu in a several-month
period shows very little variation.29 For patients with
decreasing levels, no differences were found between
patients <20% vs patients with 20% variation or
patients with final values of 15 ng/mL or >15 ng/
mL. On the contrary, for patients with increasing
levels of HER-2/neu the percentage increase 20%
and the final value >15 ng/mL identified patients
more likely to have a PD (P 5 .020 and P 5 .032,
respectively). Similar results were found for prediction of long-term response (Table 3). Patients with
an HER-2/neu decrease had a significantly longer
progression-free interval compared with patients
with an HER-2/neu increase (log-rank, P < .0001)
(Fig. 1). In particular, patients with a decrease of
HER-2/neu 20% showed a mean progression-free
interval of 14.9 months (SE 2.3), whereas patients
with an increase of HER-2/neu 20% showed a
mean progression-free interval of 2.9 months (SE
0.3). Intermediate time to progression was found in
patients with a decrease <20% (9.3 months, SE 0.9)
or with an increase <20% (6.0 months, SE 0.8). Similar findings were also observed for OS (log-rank,
P 5 .015). In the univariate analysis, the number of
metastatic sites (>3), the presence of liver metastasis,
a decrease or increase 20% of HER-2/neu between
baseline and 2 months, a 20% increase of CA 15.3,
and EGFR <45 ng/mL at baseline were significantly
associated with PFS and/or OS (data not shown). In
multivariate analysis only the presence of liver metastasis, a 20% increase of CA 15.3, and/or HER-2/
neu at 2 months were independently associated with
PFS and/or OS (Table 4), with an HER-2/neu
increase 20% being the stronger predictor of PFS.

Serum EGFR
Samples for EGFR determination were available for
113 patients at baseline with levels ranging from 34
to 71 ng/mL (mean value 52.2 ng/mL  7.2). At
2 months the levels remained stable (mean value 51.2
ng/mL  7.5). Serum EGFR in cancer patients was
similar to the mean value found in our control group
(58.4 ng/mL  7.3, range, 45.4–75.0, P 5 .49). EGFR
levels did not change significantly after 2 months in
patients with response to chemotherapy (baseline:

DISCUSSION
Metastatic breast cancer is a chronic disease requiring specific strategies to control disease progression
and related symptoms. In view of the palliative goal
of treatment, where symptomatic control with maintenance of quality of life represents a relevant clinical
outcome, strategies that can induce a prolonged clinical benefit are appropriate therapeutic choices.30
The concept of metronomically delivered therapy has
become relevant for the treatment of cancer.31,32
Metronomic, low-dose chemotherapy, alone or in
combination with proapoptotic biomodulators, has
been demonstrated to be useful in patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma,33 heavily pretreated sarcomas,34 melanomas,35 and primary36 and
metastatic breast cancer.25
A useful strategy for improving knowledge about
treatment effects is the early identification of features
associated with response or resistance to therapy.
The results of this study indicate that in patients
with metastatic breast cancer treated with metronomic chemotherapy, serum EGFR and serum HER2/neu levels are important markers for both response
and outcome. Low baseline serum EGFR levels and a
20% increase of serum HER-2/neu concentration at
2 months are both associated with reduced PFS and

OS. In particular, upon multivariate analysis an
increase of serum HER-2/neu 20% after 2 months
of therapy resulted in an independent prognostic factor for PFS.
Other authors investigated the possible role of
serum HER-2/neu in patients treated with different
chemotherapy. Apart from trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy, where several preliminary studies,
although mainly retrospective, have demonstrated
the clinical importance of serum HER-2/neu determination,16–19,37,38 some reports have also demonstrated the adverse predictive and prognostic role of
elevated serum HER2/neu in patients treated with
hormone15 or with standard chemotherapy including taxane and anthracycline.10,13,14,39–41
In a preliminary study on metastatic breast cancer patients treated with metronomic chemotherapy,26 we demonstrated that HER-2/neu can help in
identifying patients less likely to respond to treatment. In the present prospective study, early serum
concentration changes of HER-2/neu resulted in the
best predictor of long-term response: this had been
suggested in the course of trastuzumab-based therapy,18 but has never been demonstrated in patients
treated with therapies possibly correlated with an
antiangiogenic activity, such as metronomic therapy.
In breast cancer HER2/neu overexpression is correlated with increased VEGF expression,42 enhancing
tumor angiogenesis.43 The correlation among
decrease of serum HER-2neu values, response to
treatment, and improved outcome might be the
result of the antiangiogenic activity of the therapy
and of the decreased expression of antiangiogenic
factors. This finding is of particular interest because
in metronomic therapy we still lack a reliable early
marker of antiangiogenic activity, although recent
studies have shown a correlation between circulating
endothelial cells (CEC) kinetics and clinical outcome
in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving
metronomic chemotherapy.44
The possibility of obtaining information simply
with 2 blood HER-2/neu determinations offers an
attractive approach that is easy to implement, of low
cost, and providing early and relevant information. A
decrease of 20% is associated with a longer PFS,
thus confirming previous data reported in patients
treated with trastuzumab.45 It should also be emphasized that this marker maintained its clinical relevance independent of the HER-2/neu status of the
primary tumor: given the fact that we did not have a
biopsy, we were not able to determine whether a
change of the HER-2/neu status took place in the
metastasis of the patients with increased serum
HER-2/neu and a negative tumor HER-2/neu.

FIGURE 2. (a) Progression-free survival and (b) overall survival in function of EGFR concentration at baseline.
The finding that serum EGFR \45 ng/mL before
the start of chemotherapy is predictive of short- and
long-term response, and that it is significantly correlated with PFS and OS, is interesting. To date, few
studies have evaluated the possible role of this
marker. The concentrations reported in the literature
for serum EGFR in patients with advanced breast
cancer are comparable to ours. The first reports did
not find any association between serum EGFR and
response to therapy or prediction of survival.20–22
However, in these studies the authors analyzed, in
particular, the differences between the control group
of normal subjects or the increases of serum EGFR.
Instead, we focused on patients with low levels of serum EGFR: 19 patients showed decreased levels, and
among these only 4 (21%) showed a long-term clinical benefit. Moreover, the analysis of PFS and OS
curves showed that serum EGFR \45 ng/mL has a
significant prognostic value: patients with low levels
showed a mean PFS and a mean OS of 4.7 months
and 20.2 months, respectively, whereas patients with
levels comparable to those found in the control
group had a mean PFS and a mean OS of 7.8 months
and 25.5 months, respectively. These findings are in
agreement with other authors23,46 who found that
low serum EGFR showed a trend toward a worse
prognosis, although they did not find an association
between prechemotherapy values and response to
treatment. Previous studies have reported that signaling through the EGFR or HER-2/neu receptor plays a
role in the regulation of angiogenesis,47–49 with
increased VEGF expression and tumor vascularization in EGFR/HER-2/neu-positive tumors. It is there-

fore possible that patients whose tumors express low
levels of EGFR are characterized by a low angiogenic
activity, and therefore are not responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, where an antiangiogenic activity with a drop of VEGF during treatment was
previously shown.25
Our study has some limitations. First, these preliminary results were obtained from a relatively small
number of patients. However, this was a prospective
study, including a very homogeneous group of metastatic breast cancer patients. The sample size could,
for example, account for the lack of correlation
between baseline serum HER2/neu and response,
and this issue should be clarified with larger prospective studies. Moreover, the data related to the
characteristics of the primary tumor were not always
available, due to the fact that we considered women
with advanced breast cancer, who underwent surgery
years before the recurrence. Lastly, some samples
were missed at 2 months; however, this was not a
consequence of the clinical status of the patients: as
the clinical evaluation was available for all the
patients included in this study, we found that none
of the patients with elevated serum HER2/neu had a
clinical benefit.
The need for new markers that may allow a better-tailored therapy, improving the management of
the patients, is strong. For example, circulating tumor cells have recently been proposed as a very useful tool in the prognosis and monitoring of patients
with advanced breast cancer,50 and these cells may
be further characterized for HER2 and/or EGFR
expression. Further prospective studies should better

clarify the clinical importance of the information
provided by these different markers, alone or in combination. However, it should be noted that the results
of this study are in line, especially for serum HER2/
neu, with what was reported in patients treated with
other therapies, thus making them even more interesting because their use could be considered within
different therapeutic schedules.
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate
that serum HER-2/neu and serum EGFR are useful
for predicting the response to the treatment and the
long-term clinical outcome in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with metronomic chemotherapy.
Considering the results of this study and the paucity
of reliable, low-cost serum markers for prediction of
the activity of antiangiogenic therapies, the value of
these markers should be further explored in prospective and possibly multicenter trials involving new
agents with antiangiogenic activity such as bevacizumab, administered either alone or in combination
with chemotherapy.
