ABSTRACT
Overexpression of adenine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters is one of the main reasons of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells.
Trametinib, a novel specific small-molecule mitogen-activated extracellular signalregulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, is currently used for the treatment of melanoma
in clinic. In this study, we investigated the effect of trametinib on MDR mediated
by ABC transporters. Trametinib significantly potentiated the effects of two ABCB1
substrates vincristine and doxorubicin on inhibition of growth, arrest of cell cycle
and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressed ABCB1, but not ABCC1 and
ABCG2. Furthermore, trametinib did not alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 substrate
cisplatin. Mechanistically, trametinib potently blocked the drug-efflux activity of
ABCB1 to increase the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin
and stimulates the ATPase of ABCB1 without alteration of the expression of ABCB1.
Importantly, trametinib remarkably enhanced the effect of vincristine against the
xenografts of ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells in nude mice. The predicted binding
mode showed the hydrophobic interactions of trametinib within the large drug binding
cavity of ABCB1. Consequently, our findings may have important implications for use
of trametinib in combination therapy for cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

cancer cells [3-6]. For instance, ABCB1 can transport
multiple types of chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells, such
as the taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), epipodophyllotoxins
(etoposide), vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine), and
anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin), and this process
is coupled to the energy of ATP hydrolysis on the ATPase
domain [7-10]. Therefore, inhibition of these transporters
will restore the sensitivity of MDR cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents, and may permit a successful
chemotherapy to patients with MDR cancer [11, 12].
Trametinib (Mekinist, GSK1120212) is a novel
selective and highly potent small molecular inhibitor

Cancer cells with multidrug resistance (MDR) to
chemotherapeutic drugs significantly reduces the efficacy
of cancer chemotherapy [1]. Various mechanisms are
involved in the MDR of cancer, including induction of
the antiapoptotic machinery, increase of the intracellular
drug efflux, reduce of the drug uptake, and so on [2].
Overexpressing the adenine triphosphate (ATP)-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, particularly ABCB1 (MDR1/
P-glycoprotein), ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP),
are one of most common reasons to result in MDR in

of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (MEK) with a half maximum IC50 of 0.7-14.9
nM for MEK1 and MEK2, which are the central hubs of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to
control oncogenic cell proliferation, survival, invasion,
angiogenesis and death, etc [13-15]. The preclinical
experiments demonstrated trametinib had broad anticancer
activity in multiple cancer models by inducing cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro
and in vivo, especially in cancer cells with activating
mutations of BRAF and KRAS in the MAPK pathway
[14]. In a multicentre phase 1 dose-escalation trial of 206
patients with advanced solid tumors to assesse the safety,
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data
of trametinib, the maximum tolerated dose was 3 mg
once daily, the effective half-life was around 4 days,
and active pathway inhibition and clinical activity were
recorded [16]. Another phase 1 study in 97 patients with
advanced melanoma showed substantial clinical activity
of trametinib in melanoma [17]. The following open-label,
two-stage, phase II trial with two cohorts in patients with
metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma observed significant
clinical activity of trametinib with the most common side
effects including skin-related toxicity, peripheral edema,
nausea, pruritis, diarrhea, and fatigue [18]. In the phase
3 trial in 322 patients who had metastatic melanoma with
V600E or V600K BRAF mutation, trametinib improved
progression-free survival and overall survival times in
comparesion with dacarbazine or paclitaxel [19]. Based
on these data, trametinib was approved by FDA as
monotherapy for use in patients with V600E or V600K
BRAF mutated unresectable or metastatic melanoma in
May 2013. Moreover, FDA granted accelerated approval
to the combination therapy of trametinib with a BRAF
inhibitor dabrafenib in the aforementioned patients in
January 2014, based on the improved median progressionfree survival and response rate shown with combination
therapy [20]. Currently, investigation of trametinib in
combination with other chemotherapeutical agents for
the treatment of multiple types of cancers is ongoing. In
this study, we demonstrate that trametinib significantly
sensitizes ABCB1-medidated MDR cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo by directly
antagonizing the drug-efflux activity of ABCB1.

cells KBV200 and MCF-7/ADR and their parental cells
KB and MCF-7 by MTT assay. As shown in Figure
1B, over 80% of all four cells were viable after treated
with trametinib at 10 μM, indicating that this dose
could be used as the highest concentration to explore
the ability of trametinib on enhancing the sensitivity
of chemotherapeutic drugs in ABCB1-overexpressing
MDR cancer cells. We then tested the cytotoxicity of
combination of trametinib with two ABCB1 substrates
vincristine and doxorubicin and one non-ABCB1 substrate
cisplatin at the various concentrations. The summary
IC50 values and survival curves were shown in Table 1
and Figure 1C. Compared with KB and MCF-7 cells,
KBV200 and MCF-7/ADR cells exhibited high resistance
to vincristine and doxorubicin but not to cisplatin.
Trametinib dose-dependently decreased the IC50 values of
vincristine and doxorubicin in both KBV200 and MCF-7/
ADR cells but not in KB and MCF-7 cells, which was
similar to the effects of the known ABCB1 inhibitor
verapamil. Furthermore, trametinib did not significantly
alter the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in either MDR or parental
cells. In addition, we also detected the effects of trametinib
on ABCC1 and ABCG2-mediated MDR, and found that
trametinib at 10 μM did not reduce the resistances of
vincristine (also the substrate of ABCC1) in ABCC1overexpressing cells KB-CV60 and doxorubicin (also the
substrate of ABCG2) in ABCG2-overexpressing cells S1M1-80 (Supplementary Figure 1). Together, our results
demonstrated that trametinib significantly enhanced the
sensitivity of ABCB1-substrate chemotherapeutic agents
in the ABCB1-overexpressing cells, suggesting trametinib
is able to antagonize ABCB1-mediated cancer MDR in
vitro.

Trametinib in combination with ABCB1-substrate
chemotherapeutic agents induces cell cycle arrest
in the ABCB1-overexpressing cells
To evaluate the effects of trametinib in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents in the ABCB1overexpressing cells, cell cycle distribution and the
related proteins were detected by FCM and Western blot,
respectively. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, co-treatment
with trametinib and vincristine significantly increased
the cell population of sub-G1 and G2/M phase and the
levels of G2/M-phase dominant proteins cyclin B1 and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in comparison with
trametinib or vincristine alone treatment in KBV200 cells
but not in KB cells. Similarly, co-treatment with trametinib
and doxorubicin significantly increased the cell population
of sub-G1 and G2/M phase and the protein levels of cyclin
B1 and p21 in comparison with trametinib or doxorubicin
alone treatment in MCF-7/ADR cells but not in MCF-7
cells.

Trametinib in combination with ABCB1-substrate
chemotherapeutic agents induces apoptosis in the
ABCB1-overexpressing cells

co-treatment with trametinib and vincristine obviously
inhibited the growth of KBV200 xenografts with the
inhibition ratio of 63.29% (Figure 4E). Furthermore,
there was no loss of mice body weight in the combination
group, suggesting that the combination regimen at the
indicated dose did not cause toxicity in mice (Figure
4D). Additionally, the results of immunohistochemical
staining showed that the percentage of C-PARP positive
cells in KBV200 xenografts was significantly increased in
the combination group in comparison with vincristine or
trametinib alone group (Figure 4F).

To further estimate the effects of trametinib
in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in the
ABCB1-overexpressing cells, cell apoptosis and the
related proteins were also detected by FCM and Western
blot, respectively. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, cotreatment with trametinib and vincristine dramatically
enhanced the early apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI-) and late
apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI+) and the protein levels of
apoptotic marker cleaved PARP (C-PARP) in comparison
with trametinib or vincristine alone treatment in KBV200
cells but not in KB cells. Similarly, co-treatment with
trametinib and doxorubicin dramatically enhanced the
apoptosis and the protein levels of C-PARP in comparison
with trametinib or doxorubicin alone treatment in MCF-7/
ADR cells but not in MCF-7 cells. In addition, the protein
levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) were completely
blocked by trametinib in all four cells.

Trametinib
increases
the
intercellular
accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin
in ABCB1-overexpressing cells
To examine whether trametinib antagonizing
ABCB1-mediated cancer MDR is owing to inhibition
of the transporter activity of ABCB1, we measured the
intracellular levels of two ABCB1 substrates rhodamine
123 and doxorubicin in the presence or absence
of trametinib. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, the
intracellular levels of both rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin
in KBV200 and MCF-7/ADR cells were significantly
lower than those in KB and MCF-7 cells, respectively.
Trametinib dose-dependently increased the intracellular
levels of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin in both KBV200
and MCF-7/ADR cells but not in KB and MCF-7 cells,
which was equal to the effects of verapamil, suggesting
that trametinib is able to directly inhibiting the drug efflux
function of ABCB1.

To confirm the ability of trametinib antagonizing
ABCB1-mediated cancer MDR in vivo, KBV200 xenografts
models were generated in the nude mice. As shown in

alone did not inhibit the growth of KBV200 xenografts, but

Trametinib stimulates the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 and does not alert the expression of
ABCB1

soon as for 1h in all four cells, but the protein levels of
ABCB1 were not altered in KBV200 and MCF-7/ADR cells
after trametinib treatment even up to 72 hours (Figure 6B).
These data indicate that trametinib is able to inhibit the
activity of MEK but unable to alter the protein expression
of ABCB1.

The transporter function of ABCB1 is coupled to
ATP hydrolysis, which is stimulated in the presence of
ABCB1 substrates. To assess the effects of trametinib on
the ATPase activity of ABCB1, we detected the ABCB1mediated ATP hydrolysis with various concentrations of
trametinib. As shown in Figure 6A, trametinib enhanced
the ATPase activity of ABCB1 in the dose-dependent
manner with the EC50 value of 1.02 μM, suggesting
that trametinib is the substrate of ABCB1. In addition,
the reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR can be achieved
either by inhibiting its pump activity or by decreasing its
expression. To study the effect of trametinib on ABCB1
expression, the protein levels were detected by Western
blot after treatment with trametinib at 10 μM at the various
time points. The results showed that the protein levels of
pERK were totally inhibited after trametinib treatment as

Model for binding of trametinib to ABCB1
To understand the mechanism of binding of
trametinib to ABCB1 at a molecular level, docking studies
were performed with the crystal structure of mouse Mdr3
as represented by ABCB1-QZ59-RRR, ABCB1-QZ59SSS and ABCB1-verapamil. As shown in Figure 7A and
7B, the predicted binding mode showed the hydrophobic
interactions of trametinib within the large drug binding
cavity of ABCB1. Trametinib was stabilized through
specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding and
nonspecific interactions such as hydrophobic interactions
with residues in the drug-binding pocket of ABCB1. The

DISCUSSION

[34], or panitumumab and trastuzumabr [35]. Trametinib
also enhanced the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on human
colon cancer cells [36], and have synergistic effects with
metformin on cell viability and tumor growth in NRAS
mutant cancer [37]. In a phase Ib study in 31 patients
with advanced solid tumours, administration of trametinib
in combination with gemcitabine was feasible, and
the addition of trametinib might increase gemcitabineassociated myelosuppression although pharmacokinetics
suggested no change in exposures of either drug in
combination [38]. However, in the following phase II
study in 160 patients with previously untreated metastatic
pancreas cancer, the addition of trametinib to gemcitabine
did not improve overall survival, progression-free
survival, overall response rate and duration of response
[39]. Trametinib could safely be given with weekly
paclitaxel at the full monotherapy dose with promising
progression free and overall survival in the phase I trial in
patients with melanoma lacking a V600 BRAF mutation
[40]. Concurrent treatment with trametinib and the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus resulted in frequent treatmentrelated adverse events, and pharmacodynamic data did
not indicate drug-drug interactions between these two
agents in the phase Ib trial in 67 patients with advanced
solid tumors [41]. In a phase I study in 20 patients
with solid tumors and multiple myeloma, trametinib in
combination with the AKT inhibitor afuresertib were
poorly tolerated at continuous daily dosing, but tolerable
at intermittent dosing schedule [42]. In another phase
Ib trial in 113 patients with advanced solid tumors, cotreatment with trametinib and PI3K inhibitor buparlisib
showed promising antitumor activity for patients with
KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer, but long-term tolerability
of the combination was challenging due to frequent dose
interruptions and reductions for toxicity [43]. Together, the
combination of trametinib with other anticancer agents,
especially ABCB1-substrate chemotherapeutic agents,
need to be further investigated in the either preclinical
models or clinical trials.
To sum up, our results shows that trametinib
significantly antagonizes ABCB1-mediated cancer MDR
in vitro and in vivo by directly blocking the drug-efflux
function of ABCB1, which is supported by the predicted
binding mode that showed the hydrophobic interactions
of trametinib within the large drug binding cavity of
ABCB1. Consequently, our findings may have important
implications for use of trametinib in combination therapy
for cancer treatment.

Targeted therapy currently is one of the major
strategies for cancer therapy, which suppresses the
growth of cancer cells by inhibiting specific molecular
targets required for cancer growth. Small molecular agent
is the main category of targeted therapy. Until now, a
number of small molecules for cancer targeted therapy
were successfully used in clinic, such as BCL-Abl
inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib for chronic myelogenous
leukemia, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib for non small cell
lung cancer, vascular epidermal growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib for renal cell
carcinoma, etc. However, emerging literatures suggest
that in addition to mutations of targets, overexpression of
ABC transporters may contribute to the development of
resistance to these small molecular agents [21, 22]. We
and others have reported that several small molecular
agents, including imatinib [23], dasatinib [24], gefitinib
[25], erlotinib [26], icotinib [27], sorafenib [28], sunitinib
[29], lapatinib [30], apatinib [31], afatinib [32] and so
on, are substrates or modulators of ABCB1 or ABCG2.
Therefore, when the combination of these small molecules
with ABCB1- or ABCG2-substrate agents is applied in the
clinic, it should pay attention to the plasma concentrations
and tissue distribution of these agents which may be
interfered with each other, resulting in unexpected adverse
effects. In addition, it is necessary to investigate the
interactions of novel small molecules for cancer targeted
therapy with ABC transporters.
In the present study, we showed that trametinib
significantly potentiated the effects of vincristine and
doxorubicin on inhibition of growth, arrest of cell cycle
and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressed
ABCB1, but not ABCC1 and ABCG2. Mechanistically,
trametinib potently blocked the drug-efflux activity of
ABCB1 to increase the intracellular accumulation of
rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin and stimulates the ATPase
of ABCB1 without alteration of the expression of ABCB1,
suggesting that trametinib may work as the substrate of
ABCB1 to inhibit its function. This is consistent with a
recent publication, which demonstrated ABCB1 plays an
important role in limiting brain distribution of trametinib,
indicating that trametinib is the substrate of ABCB1
[33].Consequently, when the combination of trametinib
with ABCB1-substrate agents is adminstrated in vivo,
the safety and efficacy of these agents may be affected
mutually. In our case, the combination of trametinib with
vincristine dramatically inhibited the growth of ABCB1overexpressing xenograft tumors in nude mice without
loss of body weight, suggesting that the combination
regimen herein is safe and efficient. Additionally, it has
been reported that inhibition of the growth of patientderived pancreatic cancer xenografts with trametinib
was augmented by combined treatment with lapatinib

ml), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and DNasefree RNase (100 μg/ml), and detected by FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (FCM) after 15 minutes incubation at room
temperature in the dark. Fluorescence was measured at an
excitation wavelength of 480 nm through a FL-2filter (585
nm). Data were analyzed using ModFit LT 3.0 software.

Cell culture and reagents
The ABCB1-overexpressing MDR cancer cells,
KBV200 and MCF-7/ADR, were generated from human
cancer cells KB and MCF-7 by stepwise exposure
to increasing doses of vincristine and doxorubicin,
respectively [44]. The ABCC1-overexpressing MDR
cancer cells KB-CV60 were derived from KB-31 cells and maintained in medium with 1 μg/mL of
cepharanthine and 60 ng/mL of vincristine [45]. The
ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells S1-M1-80
were established from S1 cells and maintained in the
medium with 80 μM of mitoxantrone [46]. All cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 ng/ml) in a
humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Trametinib
was obtained from ApeBio. Vincristine, doxorubicin and
cisplatin were ordered from LC Laboratories. Verapamil
and rhodamine 123 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT),
propidium iodide (PI), hematoxylin and other chemicals
were purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai).
Pgp-GloTM Assay Systems (V3601) was acquired from
Promega. Anti-pErk (4370), Anti-Erk (9102), Anti-PARP
(9542), Anti-cleaved PARP (5625) and Anti-XIAP (2045)
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anticyclin B (61029) and Anti-p21 (554262) antibodies were
from BD Biosciences. Anti-ABCB1 (SC-13131) antibody
was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-GAPDH
(KM9002) antibody was from Tianjin Sungene Biotech.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS,
stained with Annexin V‑FITC and propidium iodide
(PI) in the binding buffer, and detected by FCM after
15 minutes incubation at room temperature in the dark.
Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wave length
of 480 nm through FL-1 (530 nm) and FL-2 filters (585
nm). The early apoptotic cells (Annexin V positive only)
and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V and PI positive)
were quantified with the FlowJO software as previously
described [48].

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 ng/
ml PMSF, 0.03% aprotinin, 1μM sodium orthovanadate)
at 4°C for 30 minutes. After centrifuged for 10 minutes
at 14,000 × g, supernatants were collected. Protein
concentration was quantified using with Bradford assay.
Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated
with the indicated primary antibodies. Corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
were used against each primary antibody. Proteins were
detected using the chemiluminescent detection reagents
and films.

Cell viability assay

Nude mice xenograft tumor assay

Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of
5 × 103 cells/well and treated with various concentrations
of agents for 72 hours. MTT was added to each well at
a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After incubation for
4 hours, formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 ml of
DMSO, and absorbance at 570 nm was measured by plate
reader. The concentrations required to inhibit growth
by 50% (IC50) were calculated from survival curves as
previously described [47].

Balb/c nude mice were obtained from the
Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center and
maintained with sterilized food and water. Six female nude
mice with 5 weeks old and 18-22 g weight were used for
each group. Every mouse was injected subcutaneously
of the KBV200 cells (3×106 in 100μl of DMEM) under
the right shoulder. When the subcutaneous tumors were
approximately 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 (two perpendicular diameters)
in size, the mice were randomized into four groups
and treated with the following regimens: vehicle alone
(0.9% saline), vincristine (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally),
trametinib (3 mg/kg, orally), and the combination of
vincristine with trametinib every two days. The body
weights of the animals and the two perpendicular
diameters (A and B) were recorded every 2 days. The

Cell cycle assay
Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold
phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS), then fixed with ice-cold
70% ethanol for 30 minutes at 4 °C. After centrifugation at
200 × g for 10 minutes, cells were washed twice with PBS
and resuspended with 0.5 ml PBS containing PI (50 μg/

for 5 minutes, then incubated with different concentrations
of drugs at 37°C for 3 minutes. The ATPase reaction
was incubated by the addition of 5 mM Mg-ATP. After
incubating at 37°C for 20 minutes, the reactions were
stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 5% SDS solution. The
liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured as
previously described [52].

Docking protocol
The 3D structure of trametinib was obtained from
the software ChemDraw 7.0. The refined crystal structure
of mouse ABCB1 in complex with QZ59-RRR (PDB
ID: 4M2S) and QZ59-SSS (PDB ID: 4M2T) [53] was
obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Docking
experiments were performed with Discovery Studio 3.0.
The top-scoring pose ABCB1 complex was then subjected
to energy minimization and used for graphical analysis.

Immunohistochemistry assay
Immunohistochemistry assay was performed with
a microwave-enhanced avidin-biotin stainingmethod as
previously described [49, 50]. Formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor tissue slides were deparaffinized using
xylene and graded ethyl alcohol and then rinsed in
water. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the
slides in 0.01 M citrate buffer in a microwave oven for
10 minutes and cooling at room temperature. The slides
were then incubated with 0.05% Triton-X100 in PBS for 5
minutes, followed by sequential treatment in a humidified
chamber after quenching endogenous peroxides with
3% H2O2 in MeOH: blocking serum with avidin for 20
minutes, anti-cleaved-PARP antibody overnight at 4 °C,
secondary antibody for 20 minutes, hydrogen peroxidase
for 15 minutes, and peroxidase substrate solution for 20
minutes at room temperature. The stained slides were then
counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. The
percentages of C-PARP positive cells were quantified as
the average of five fields for each slide.

Statistical analysis
A student’s t-test was used to compare individual
data points among each group. A P-value of <0.05 was set
as the criterion for statistical significance.
