ABSTRACT:
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are notoriously difficult to treat because
they lack hormone receptors and have limited targeted therapies. Recently, we
demonstrated that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is essential for TNBC growth and
survival indicating it as a target for therapeutic development. RSK phosphorylates
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1), an oncogenic transcription/translation factor,
highly expressed in TNBC (~70% of cases) and associated with poor prognosis, drug
resistance and tumor initiation. YB-1 regulates the tumor-initiating cell markers, CD44
and CD49f however its role in Notch signaling has not been explored. We sought to
identify novel chemical entities with RSK inhibitory activity. The Prestwick Chemical
Library of 1120 off-patent drugs was screened for RSK inhibitors using both in vitro
kinase assays and molecular docking. The lead candidate, luteolin, inhibited RSK1
and RSK2 kinase activity and suppressed growth in TNBC, including TIC-enriched
populations. Combining luteolin with paclitaxel increased cell death and unlike
chemotherapy alone, did not enrich for CD44+ cells. Luteolin’s efficacy against drugresistant cells was further indicated in the primary x43 cell line, where it suppressed
monolayer growth and mammosphere formation. We next endeavored to understand
how the inhibition of RSK/YB-1 signaling by luteolin elicited an effect on TIC-enriched
populations. ChIP-on-ChIP experiments in SUM149 cells revealed a 12-fold enrichment
of YB-1 binding to the Notch4 promoter. We chose to pursue this because there are
several reports indicating that Notch4 maintains cells in an undifferentiated, TIC state.
Herein we report that silencing YB-1 with siRNA decreased Notch4 mRNA. Conversely,
transient expression of Flag:YB-1WT or the constitutively active mutant Flag:YB-1D102
increased Notch4 mRNA. The levels of Notch4 transcript and the abundance of the
Notch4 intracellular domain (N4ICD) correlated with activation of P-RSKS221/7 and
P-YB-1S102 in a panel of TNBC cell lines. Silencing YB-1 or RSK reduced Notch4 mRNA
and this corresponded with loss of N4ICD. Likewise, the RSK inhibitors, luteolin
and BI-D1870, suppressed P-YB-1 S102 and thereby reduced Notch4. In conclusion,
inhibiting the RSK/YB-1 pathway with luteolin is a novel approach to blocking Notch4
signaling and as such provides a means of inhibiting TICs.

INTRODUCTION

we explored the idea this is because YB-1 regulates TIC
survival. TICs are hypothesized to be at the root of cancer
recurrence as they are resistant to chemotherapy and
radiation [17-21]. TICs, by definition, have an increased
capacity to initiate tumor formation when transplanted into
immunocompromised mice [22]. They make up a subset
of the entire tumor ranging from 10%-60% and can be
enriched through flow cytometry sorting for cells with
CD44+/CD24-/ESA+/CD49f+ surface marker phenotype
and also through non-adherent mammosphere culture
conditions [22-25]. TIC expression correlates with highgrade tumors, is associated with distant metastases and
TICs have been detected in circulating tumor cells from
women with breast cancer [26]. Further, the CD44associated gene signature is predictive of poor survival
[27]. To support the role of YB-1 in regulating a TIC
phenotype, we previously determined that YB-1 binds
to the promoters of CD44 and CD49f and induces their
expression [17]. Consequently, there is an enhancement
of self-renewal and mammosphere growth, as well as an
increase in drug resistance in TNBC cells [17]. Conversely,
silencing YB-1 decreases CD44 expression and sensitizes
cells to chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel [17].
Collectively, these data point towards YB-1 as a promising
molecular target for the treatment of aggressive forms of
breast cancer.
TICs exploit many of the same canonical stem cell
signaling networks that regulate normal tissue-specific
stem cells. In the mammary gland, the Notch signaling
pathway plays an important role in development and
cell fate determination [28]. The Notch4 isoform in
particular has been implicated in mammary stem cells.
Notch4 mRNA levels are highest in undifferentiated,
bipotent human mammary progenitor cells and decrease
upon differentiation [29]. Aberrant expression of the
active intracellular domain of Notch4 (N4ICD) prevents
differentiation and ultimately induces mammary
carcinomas in mice [30]. In breast cancer cell lines and
patient samples, CD44+/CD24-/ESA+-sorted TICs express
higher levels of activated N4ICD than their non-TIC
counterparts [24]. Conversely, expression of Notch1
intracellular domain (N1ICD) is lowest in TICs indicating
differential activation of Notch isoforms between TIC and
non-TIC populations. Blocking Notch4 specifically using
RNA interference reduces the number of CD44+/CD24-/
ESA+ cells, suppresses mammosphere formation and
completely inhibits tumor initiation whereas inhibiting
Notch 1 has only a modest effect [24, 31]. Interestingly,
YB-1 binds to the promoters of several stem-cellassociated genes including Notch4 yet, YB-1’s role in
regulating TICs through Notch4 signaling remains to be
explored [32].
However, with no small molecules or drugs to
directly inhibit YB-1, we instead sought to block RSK
kinase activity and thereby prevent phosphorylation of
YB-1. We have demonstrated that inhibiting YB-1 using

Therapeutic intervention relies on conventional
chemotherapeutics for patients with triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). Since this subtype does not express
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or
Her-2 patients are ineligible for targeted agents to these
molecules such as tamoxifen or trastuzumab. Compared
to other subtypes, TNBC has an aggressive clinical course
and women with this subtype are faced with the highest
recurrence and death rates within the first five years after
diagnosis, underscoring the imperative need for new
treatments [1-4].
The p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK), particularly
RSK1 and RSK2, are associated with breast cancer
growth. This family of serine/threonine kinases is part
of the MAPK pathway and is responsible for activating
a wide range of substrates involved in cell proliferation,
motility and survival [5, 6]. Moreover, RSK signaling
deregulation may play a role in pre-neoplastic progression
to neoplastic disease [7]. RSK1 is primarily known for its
role in promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis [8,
9]. Importantly, RSK2 has recently been identified as a
lead molecular target for TNBC [10, 11]. In an unbiased,
genome-wide screen for breast cancer subtype-specific
inhibitors, RSK2 was one of only three molecules found
to be important for sustaining the growth of TNBC [11].
Building on this, we demonstrated that suppressing RSK2
inhibited growth of TNBC cell lines and delayed tumor
initiation in mice, providing the first proof-of-concept
for RSK2 inhibitors in TNBC [10]. As such, RSK is
positioned as a molecular target that could individualize
therapy for patients with this breast cancer subtype.
However, currently there are no clinically available RSK
inhibitors yet a few small molecules have been identified
through screening efforts in the past five years [12-15].
Considering the poor prognosis for patients with TNBC,
this new information indicating that RSK2 inhibitors could
improve treatment of this disease makes a focus in this
area timely.
RSK is the predominant kinase that phosphorylates
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) at its S102 site [5].
YB-1 is an oncogenic transcription/translation factor
that promotes breast cancer growth and drug resistance.
Upon phosphorylation at S102, P-YB-1S102 translocates to
the nucleus and promotes the induction of growth factors
such as EGFR, Her-2, and the MET receptor as well as
the tumor-initiating-cell (TIC)-associated genes CD44 and
CD49f [1]. Indeed, YB-1 may be a signature feature of
aggressive forms of breast cancer. We have determined that
YB-1 is associated with relapse and poor survival in all
breast cancer subtypes, expressed in 60-70% of the most
aggressive subtypes (TNBC and Her-2) and is a stronger
prognostic marker for breast cancer than those currently
used in the clinic [1, 16]. Since YB-1 and P-YB-1S102
expression are tightly associated with cancer recurrence

this approach is effective at eliminating TICs [10]. Further,
since translating the use of RSK/YB-1 inhibitors into the
clinic would be costly and time consuming, we questioned
whether existing drugs had RSK-inhibitory activity. As the
underlying mechanisms driving carcinogenesis become
better understood, repositioning currently approved drugs
for the treatment of cancer has become an area of interest
[33-35]. One of the best examples is the identification of
salinomycin, which was derived from a screen of 16,000
off-patent compounds in a search to find new opportunities
to inhibit breast TICs [36]. In another example of drug
repositioning, the anti-diabetic drug metformin was shown
to inhibit the growth of breast TICs [37, 38] and prevent
relapse in xenograft models of prostate and lung cancer
[39]. Disulfiram, a drug used to manage alcoholism, has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also been described as being able to kill CD44+ cells in
models of breast cancer [40]. We therefore hypothesized
that there may currently be existing compounds that would
inhibit the RSK/YB-1 pathway. To this end, we screened
the Prestwick Chemical Library of 1120 off-patent drugs
in RSK kinase assays and molecular docking. Two major
advantages of this drug collection are that 85% of these
chemicals are FDA approved and the safety, bioavailability
and dosing schedules are established, making the
transition from initial screening to drug application more
efficient. Herein, we identified luteolin as having novel
RSK inhibitory activity with the ability to block YB-1/
Notch4 signaling and suppress growth in TIC-enriched
populations.

RESULTS

RSK1/ATP structure, kaempferol, apigenin and luteolin
were predicted to bind to RSK1 at Leu144 and Asp142,
both of which are the major sites for ATP binding in the
NTKD (Table 1) [44]. Apigenin and luteolin were also
predicted to bind to Gln70. Relative to all of the drugs
in the Prestwick Library, apigenin and luteolin ranked in
the top ~1%, scoring higher than kaempferol (Table 1).
The docking results were independently confirmed against
two additional RSK1 structures in active conformations,
RSK1 co-crystallized to staurosporine, and purvalanol
A (Supplemental Table 2). Taken together, we used
biochemical screens and computational docking to
short-list three agents that inhibited RSK at the NTKD.
Kaempferol, apigenin and luteolin are all flavonoid
analogues with remarkably similar structure, sharing a
common backbone and differing only in hydroxy group
location (Table 1). Kaempferol has known RSK inhibitory
activity [12] and therefore it served as an unbiased internal
control.
Following the RSK1 screen, a broad dose-response
study (0.001-100 μM) was conducted against RSK2 using
the YB-1 peptide as a substrate in cell-free assays (Table
2). Each of the agents inhibited its activity with similar
IC50 values ranging from 1.71-4.77 μM. BI-D1870 was
included as a positive control as it is known to inhibit
RSK1 and RSK2 [45] (Table 2). To further validate these
data, the same range of concentrations was assessed using

Screening of Prestwick Chemical Library
identified novel RSK inhibitors
We screened the Prestwick Library consisting of
1120 chemicals at 10 μM in an in vitro RSK1 kinase
assay against the YB-1 peptide containing the S102 site.
The YB-1 peptide was selected because it was previously
characterized for binding to RSK1 using in vitro kinase
assays [5] and through molecular docking [41]. Thirtytwo compounds were identified that inhibited RSK1
kinase activity >20% at 10 μM (Supplemental Table
1). When compared to the short list from the in silico
screen (including the 25 strongest predicted binders), 3
compounds were indicated in both screens: kaempferol,
luteolin and apigenin (Table 1 and Supplemental Table
1). The molecular docking screen theoretically identify
compounds that would inhibit RSK kinase activity using
Glide and ICM docking software which consistently rank
the highest in terms of docking scoring and accuracy
[42, 43]. A crystal structure of RSK1 bound to ATP in
the N-terminal kinase domain (2Z7Q.pdb) was used to
predict that kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin bind to the
kinase in its active conformation. Importantly, using this

a secondary RSK substrate, the S6K peptide, in both the
RSK1 and RSK2 kinase assays (Supplemental Table 3AB). Similarly, all three compounds inhibited the kinase
activity of both isoforms in the low micromolar range.
While the flavonoids were less potent than BI-D1870,
they are favored because they are commercially available
as dietary supplements and their safety/toxicity profiles
are established [46]. Conversely, BI-D1870, while it is a
potent RSK inhibitor, has never been tested in animals or
humans to our knowledge.

are provided to illustrate that this was a general effect
of the inhibitors (Supplemental Figure 1). Further,
immunoblotting confirmed that P-YB-1S102 was decreased
with drug treatment (Figure 1B). The blots were scanned,
normalized to αβ-tubulin and quantified. Luteolin
inhibited P-YB-1S102 by ~80% at 24 h (Figure 1C). We
next evaluated the YB-1 downstream target, CD44, by
qRT-PCR. This target is particularly important, as it has
been shown to be associated with a TIC signature ([1];
plus references therein). All of the lead compounds
decreased CD44 transcript levels (Figure 1D). These
results paralleled those of an established RSK inhibitor,
BI-D1870.
We recently published that inhibiting RSK and
thereby blocking the activation of YB-1, leads to
decreased growth in TNBC [5, 10]. We therefore assessed
lead compounds for growth effects in models of TNBC
(SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells). In these cells,
monolayer growth was significantly decreased with 10
μM luteolin (Figure 2A). At 100 μM, kaempferol and
apigenin were added to this list. No growth effect was
observed in normal immortalized mammary epithelial
cells (184hterts) at 10 μM (Supplementary Figure 2).
We then tested kaempferol, apigenin and luteolin in

Luteolin prevents activation of YB-1 and
subsequently inhibits proliferation, anchorageindependent growth and mammosphere

In the secondary screens, we investigated the lead
compounds for their ability to block P-YB-1S102 in the
TNBC cell line SUM149. In the absence of the inhibitors,
activated YB-1 was present in the nucleus (Figure 1A).
When cells were treated with the lead compounds, P-YB1S102 immunofluorescence was diminished compared
to the DMSO control (Figure 1A). Additional images

result, we questioned whether kaempferol would inhibit

by immunofluorescence for P-YB-1S102 (Supplemental

was predominantly expressed in the nucleus of the

it did (~50%) by the tertiary passage when compared to
the number of DMSO-treated primary mammospheres
(Supplemental Figure 3A). Alternatively, we tested
whether daily dosing would improve kaempferol’s ability
to inhibit mammosphere formation, as this drug may
be less stable in this cell culture assay and found that
this protocol also inhibited mammosphere formation
(Supplemental Figure 3B). We next asked whether these
compounds could inhibit growth of mammospheres
once they were already established. Apigenin and
luteolin showed a marked reduction in the number of
mammospheres in SUM149 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Supplemental Figure 3C-D). Kaempferol however, had
little effect on mammospheres once established in both
cell lines supporting the idea that although they share
similar backbones, differences in hydroxy groups between
the compounds alters the structure-activity relationship
regarding RSK inhibitory potential (Table 2, Supplemental
Figure 3C-D). Likewise, the positive control (BI-D1870)
inhibited mammosphere formation and colony growth in
soft agar (Figures 2 B-C and Supplemental Figure 3C-D).

of CD44+/CD24- cells in monolayer and in mammosphere
cultures (Figure 2D-E, Supplemental Figure 4-5).	
When the results from all levels of screening were
taken collectively, luteolin was identified as the lead
candidate as it: 1) ranked in the top ~1% out of 1120
chemicals in the in silico RSK1 docking, 2) interacted
with critical ATP binding residues in the RSK1 NTKD,
3) demonstrated ~80% knockdown of P-YB-1S102
protein at 24 h, 4) suppressed growth of both TNBC
cell lines in monolayer, soft agar and mammosphere
culture conditions and 5) inhibited growth of CD44+/
CD24- cells in monolayer and mammospheres. As such,
luteolin underwent further evaluation. Two additional
RSK substrates, P-GSK3βS9 and P-S6S236, were also
confirmed reduced after treatment with luteolin at 24 h
(Figure 3A). Additionally, luteolin’s inhibition of P-YB1S102 was dose-dependant (Supplemental Figure 6). Since
luteolin has been shown to interact with proteins across
several biological pathways, we compared the predicted
binding of luteolin and RSK to other potential targets [47,
48]. When luteolin was docked against 252 known drug
targets, RSK ranked highest among the list (Supplemental

Table 4). Although luteolin was predicted to bind to other
targets in addition to RSK, some of these “off-target”
proteins may have added benefit for cancer therapy as they
have also been implicated in cancer survival. For example,
KIT was identified as a putative luteolin target. KIT is a
cytokine cell-surface receptor that binds to stem cell
factor and has been indicated as an emerging therapeutic
target for breast cancer therefore may itself be effective at
treating this disease [1].
We next wanted to test the effect of combining
luteolin with a front-line chemotherapeutic, paclitaxel. An
undesirable effect of paclitaxel is that it activates RSK/
YB-1 signaling and subsequently up-regulates CD44
expression [17]. Moreover, clinical observation and
studies in cell lines have demonstrated that taxanes enrich
for CD44+/CD24- cells indicating ineffective targeting of
this population [18, 23]. Conversely, our data suggest that
luteolin actually suppresses growth of CD44+/CD24- cells.
Luteolin has also been reported to be a chemosensitizing
agent [49, 50]. We therefore hypothesized that the addition
of the RSK inhibitor luteolin would not only increase the
sensitivity of cells to paclitaxel but also eliminate the

CD44+ cells. Indeed, we found that the combination of
luteolin (50 μM) with paclitaxel (10 nM) significantly
increased cell death compared to either drug alone as
indicated by PI uptake (Figure 3B). Moreover, including
luteolin in the regimen prevented activation of P-YB-1S102
and enrichment of CD44+ cells by paclitaxel (Figure 3CD). These data suggest that the addition of a RSK inhibitor
such as luteolin to paclitaxel is an effective strategy to
improve cell death and reduce the residual CD44+ cell
burden.
Extending these findings to primary TNBC, we
tested the efficacy of luteolin in the x43 cell line, derived
from a patient who suffered relapse thus suggesting this
may be an aggressive case. Subtype classification was
confirmed by NanoString (Supplemental Figure 7). The
x43 cells had low levels of ER, PR and Her-2 mRNA
when compared to Her-2 over-expressing (HR6) cells and
had marker expression that was similar to two TNBC cell
lines (HCC1143 and MDA-MB-231). Moreover, the x43

cells represent a basal-like breast cancer as they express
EGFR, Keratin 5 and Keratin 6A (Supplemental Figure
7). Treating x43 cells with luteolin suppressed growth by
up to ~90% at 50 μM (Figure 4A). A similar effect was
seen with positive control BI-D1870. Growth inhibition
corresponded to a reduction in P-YB-1S102 beginning
at 24 h at 10 μM (Supplemental Figure 8). Luteolin
induced cell death at these concentrations as indicated
by PI uptake (Figure 4B). Moreover, x43 cells were
exquisitely sensitive to RSK inhibition in non-adherent
conditions, as luteolin completely blocked the ability to
form mammospheres at 10 μM (Figure 4C-D).

YB-1 (Flag:YB-1D102) in SUM149 cells increased levels
of Notch4 mRNA (Figure 5B, Supplemental Figure 9
for control blot). Interestingly, when comparing a panel
of TNBC cell lines (SUM149, MDA-MB-231 and x43)
the level of Notch4 mRNA and cleaved, activated,
intracellular domain (N4ICD) correlated with the levels
of P-YB-1S102 and P-RSKS221/7 (Figure 5C-D).
Building on the idea that the RSK/YB-1 pathway
regulates Notch4 signaling we investigated the levels
of Notch4 after YB-1 knockdown in the MDA-MB-231
cells (since this cell line expresses more Notch4 than
the SUM149). Reducing YB-1 using siRNA decreased
Notch4 mRNA and correspondingly decreased N4ICD
levels (Figure 6A). Similarly, knockdown of either RSK1
or RSK2 also reduced Notch4 mRNA and N4ICD (Figure
6B). This effect was further demonstrated in a second cell
line (x43) where knockdown of either RSK1, RSK2 or
YB-1 suppressed Notch4 transcript (Supplemental Figure
10). The RSK inhibitors BI-D1870 and luteolin paralleled
these results and significantly reduced Notch4 mRNA in

siRSK1

populations we identified putative YB-1 target genes using
ChIP-on-ChIP assays. These studies revealed that YB-1
binds to the promoters of several TIC-associated genes.
Most notably, we found a 12-fold enrichment of YB-1
binding to the Notch4 promoter [32]. Reports from others
demonstrate that Notch4 signaling is elevated in CD44+/
CD24- cells and that inhibiting this pathway reduces
mammosphere formation and prevents tumor initiation in
vivo identifying Notch4 as a critical regulator of breast
cancer TICs [24, 31]. The prominent role of Notch4 in
TICs hinted that luteolin’s efficacy against CD44+/CD24cells may be through inhibition of YB-1 and thereby
suppression of Notch4. To confirm our ChIP-on-ChIP
results, we tested the effect of YB-1 knockdown on all
of the Notch isoforms (Notch1-Notch4). Knockdown
of YB-1 using three different siRNAs increased Notch1
mRNA and decreased Notch4 mRNA with no effect on
the Notch2 or Notch3 isoforms in SUM149 cells (Figure
5A). Conversely, over-expression of either wild-type
YB-1 (Flag:YB-1WT) or a constitutively active mutant

both the MDA-MB-231 and the x43 cell lines (Figure

in structure of all the compounds and the fact that they
were identified in both in vitro kinase assays and in
silico docking to an ATP-bound RSK crystal structure
is indicative of a structure-activity relationship for
these compounds as ATP competitive inhibitors against
RSK. Accordingly, we demonstrate that luteolin blocks
phosphorylation of a synthetic YB-1 peptide by RSK1
and RSK2 as well as phosphorylation of YB-1 in cancer
cells and its nuclear localization. It also suppresses growth
in TNBC models. Luteolin has previously been shown
to have anti-cancer properties such as suppressing cell
survival pathways while promoting apoptosis [47, 48].
This compound is found naturally in many fruits and
vegetables and thus is considered safe for consumption
[47, 48]. In vivo experiments have also demonstrated low
toxicity with long-term treatment [47]. Moreover, it is sold
commercially as LutiMax, a nutraceutical that has reported
benefits not only for cancer but also for other disorders
ranging from inflammation to neurologic conditions such
as autism. The recommended dosing of Lutimax is 400600 mg/day with no reported toxicities. The commercial
availability of luteolin sold as LutiMax potentially
provides a means of translating our research to patients.
Luteolin is documented to alter several biological
pathways [47, 48]. To attempt to identify other putative
binding proteins, luteolin was docked to a library of 252
known drug targets. RSK scored highest within this library
with the strongest predicted binding to luteolin. While
we do not disregard that some of luteolin’s anti-cancer
effects may be through alternate signaling pathways, we
do posit that its activity as a RSK inhibitor could have
a particularly significant effect in the context of TNBC
given that RSK signaling is critical to the survival of this
breast cancer subtype [10]. Moreover, some of the other
signaling pathways that luteolin affects could be linked to
RSK inhibition. Several studies show that luteolin inhibits
NF-κB signaling and sensitizes cells to tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis [55, 56]. Interestingly,
RSK regulates NF-κB signaling through IκB kinase (IKK),
which phosphorylates IκB, targeting it for degradation and
thereby allowing NF-κβ to translocate to the nucleus and
transcribe anti-apoptotic genes [57]. Therefore, inhibition
of RSK kinase activity presents one feasible mechanism
by which luteolin could inhibit NF-κβ signaling.
Furthermore, some of the putative targets we identified for
luteolin also play a role in cancer, particularly in TNBC.
KIT is co-expressed with EGFR and is associated with
BRCA1-mutation carriers and in sporadic basal-like breast
cancer [58, 59]. Perhaps, by targeting several biological
pathways, luteolin could prevent the development of de
novo resistance in cancer cells that can occur when cells
circumvent the requirement for single pathways targeted
by highly specific inhibitors.
TICs present a major obstacle in developing
effective cancer treatments as many conventional
therapies actually enrich for CD44+ cells [18, 19, 21].

DISCUSSION
Herein, we identified the off-patent compound
luteolin, has the novel ability to block RSK/YB-1/Notch4
signaling and thereby inhibit TNBC growth including
TIC-enriched populations. Since RSK has recently been
identified as a TNBC-specific target, we focused on
screening for compounds that have the ability to block
RSK activity. We used a dual approach of high-throughput
and virtual screening, as these are complementary methods
that can be integrated to improve inhibitor discovery
[51]. Notably, both screening techniques identified
kaempferol, luteolin and apigenin that inhibited RSK1
and RSK2 at micromolar concentrations. Subsequent
experiments identified luteolin as the lead compound
as it suppressed growth in TNBC and inhibited RSK in
cells. Consequently, it reduced phosphorylation of YB-1
and decreased Notch4 signaling, both of which are key
pathways in sustaining TICs.
RSK2 is an emerging therapeutic target for
developing treatments for TNBC, for which there are
currently no targeted therapies available [11]. Our group
identified that RSK2 specifically has the most potent
inhibitory effect on growth in TNBC [10]. Furthermore,
we propose that RSK inhibitors could have application
beyond breast cancer to include other tumors that express
high RSK2 such as those that develop in the lung, head
and neck, prostate and hematopoietic system [52].
Several other groups have demonstrated that the RSK2
isoform appears to be the most relevant in cancers [53].
In an effort to identify new RSK2 specific inhibitors,
Liu et al (2011) identified eriodictyol through molecular
docking [13]. Interestingly, eriodictyol is a flavonoid
that is structurally very similar to, luteolin, apigenin
and kaempferol. Similarly, Berghe et al (2011) found
the flavanone, lavandylyl, to attenuate the ERK/RSK2 pathway suggesting that there is a structural basis for
flavonoids in inhibiting RSK2 [15]. Flavonoids have also
been indicated as promising anti-cancer agents in recent
years. Additionally, they have shown evidence of having
anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory,
and anti-cancer beneficial health effects [54]. These
naturally occurring compounds are therefore attractive
starting points for synthesizing analogues that have higher
selectivity and potency. Herein, we identified the flavones
luteolin and apigenin with remarkably similar structure
had significant growth effects on TNBC. Kaempferol,
which is also a flavonoid, served as the basis for making
SL0101, an agent that is now utilized as a RSK inhibitor
for research purposes [14]. Thus, kaempferol served as
an excellent unbiased control in this study. The similarity

However, reducing YB-1 expression or preventing
its activation via RSK inhibition, are both effective
strategies for reducing the TIC burden [10, 17]. As such
we investigated whether luteolin could suppress growth
in CD44+/CD24- cells through inhibition of the RSK/
YB-1 pathway. Additionally, since luteolin suppresses
cell survival mechanisms and induces apoptosis in cancer
cells we speculated that it might work as chemosensitizing
agent in conjunction with chemotherapeutics. It has
demonstrated this property in other cancers including in
gastric cancer when used in combination with cisplatin
[49]. Herein, we demonstrate that the addition of
luteolin to paclitaxel increased cytotoxicity in TNBC.
Importantly, unlike paclitaxel alone the combination
of the two compounds did not enrich for CD44+ cells.
Moreover, luteolin suppresses growth, induces apoptosis
and inhibits mammosphere formation in primary human
TNBC cells. TICs also play an important role in mediating
drug resistance in other breast cancer subtypes. In mice,
the addition of luteolin reversed doxorubicin resistance in
MCF-7 and 4T1 cells. It also remarkably enhanced the
effect of doxorubicin on tumor suppression [50]. In this
study, luteolin was actually safer as a single agent and
more effective than doxorubicin [50]. We have shown that
RSK and YB-1 are up-regulated in trastuzumab-resistant
cell lines HR5 and HR6 when compared to their sensitive
counterpart BT474 [60]. Expression of an active mutant
YB-1D102 induced expression of CD44 and conveyed
trastuzumab insensitivity to BT474 cells. Conversely,
reducing CD44 in HR5 and HR6 cells restored sensitivity
to trastuzumab. Thus, combining luteolin with currently
used chemotherapeutics may present an effective strategy
for eliminating TICs across several breast cancer subtypes.
	 The Notch family of transmembrane receptors,
particularly Notch4, has been implicated in mammary
stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and expansion [28].
In both the normal mammary gland and breast cancer,
Notch4 signaling maintains an undifferentiated, stem/
progenitor-like state [24, 29-31]. Previous experiments
revealed that YB-1 binds to the promoter of Notch4
and increases its expression [32]. Herein, we show that
inhibiting RSK/YB-1 signaling with siRNA or small
molecules reduces Notch4 levels and activation. Harrison
et al (2010) demonstrate that Notch4 signaling is highest
in TICs whereas Notch1 signaling is highest in non-TIC
fractions [24]. Interestingly, YB-1 knockdown mimics this
pattern of expression and reduces Notch4 mRNA while
increasing Notch1 mRNA levels. Constitutive Notch4
signaling promotes an aggressive malignant phenotype in
MDA-MB-231 cells increasing vascularization and growth
of xenograft models [61]. Conversely, inhibiting Notch4
using antibodies specific to this isoform is more effective
at suppressing mammosphere formation than γ-secretase
inhibitors which inhibit all Notch isoforms (Notch1Notch4) indicating that the Notch4 isoform specifically,
is important for mammosphere forming ability [31].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Furthermore, the γ-secretase inhibitor, MRK003, was
recently shown to inhibit tumor initiation in mice using an
ErbB2 model of mammary tumorigenesis and mice treated
with MRK003 had durable long-term relapse free survival
[62]. Collectively, these data point to an essential role for
Notch4 in cancer recurrence through the maintenance of
TICs.
We conclude that drug repositioning can be used
to identify agents for molecular targets such as RSK.
We identify luteolin as having the novel ability to inhibit
RSK/YB-1 activation and suppress Notch4 signaling.
The discovery of RSK-specific inhibitors that can be
fast-tracked into clinic may have significant implications
for treating TNBC, where the disease is aggressive and
targeted therapies are unavailable. This is an important
advance because luteolin inhibits RSK activity and is
commercially available as LutiMax. This preclinical
study provides the rationale for addressing the potential
for luteolin for the treatment of TNBC in vivo and in a
clinical trial setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Initial RSK1 kinase screens and chemicals
For RSK1, the entire Prestwick Chemical Library
(1120 chemicals; Canadian Chemical Biology Network
at the University of British Columbia) was screened by
SignalChem (Richmond, BC) in a kinase assay at 10 μM
against a YB-1 peptide, PRKYLRSVG, [41] as previously
described [5]. This peptide contains the YB-1 S102 site.
Results were compared to a staurosporine control, a
broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor that has 100% activity at
10 μM. Compounds with >20% inhibitory activity were
considered to be significant RSK1 inhibitors. To confirm
RSK1 kinase inhibition, we repeated the kinase assay
using a secondary RSK substrate, S6K. Kaempferol,
apigenin and luteolin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical (Oakville, ON) and were dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma) to stock concentrations of 100 mM. BI-D1870, a
known RSK inhibitor [45], was synthesized by the Center
for Drug Research and Development (Vancouver, BC).

In silico RSK1 screens
In silico analysis was performed on lead compounds
using the molecular docking program Glide [63, 64]. The
docked poses were ranked based on docking score. The
Glide docking was performed as follows: For the three
crystal structures of N-terminal domain, the cognate
ligands were used to define the active sites and generate
the grid. Both Glide standard precision (SP) and extra
precision (XP) modes were used for the docking, and
for each ligand, the highest scored pose was written out.

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 329-345

We used three different resolved crystal structures of
RSK1, all of which are in the active conformation of the
N-terminal domain (2Z7Q.pdb, 2Z7R.pdb, 2Z7S.pdb) cocrystallized with different ligands (ATP, staurosporine, and
puravalnol A). Other parameters in Glide were kept at the
default setting.

RSK2 kinase

Transfections

Kinase profiling services for RSK2 were provided
by SignalChem, as previously described [5]. Briefly, the
compounds kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin and BI-D1870
were screened in a RSK2 kinase assay at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1,
1.0, 10, and 100 μM against a YB-1 peptide containing the
S102 site [41]. Results were compared to a staurosporine
control. For each compound, a graph of log concentration
(μM) versus % inhibition of RSK2 activity was generated
and IC50 values were determined. To confirm inhibition of
RSK2 activity, we also repeated the kinase assay with a
secondary RSK substrate, S6K.

To investigate the effect of altering YB-1 on
expression of Notch isoforms, SUM149 cells were
transfected with three distinct siRNAs against YB-1 or
scramble control (20 nM) for 96 h as described in [17].
SUM149 cells were transiently transfected with 4 µg of
Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1-WT or Flag:YB-1-D102 plasmids and
subsequently harvested after 96 h [17]. MDA-MB-231 and
x43 cells were treated with (20 nM) siRSK1 or siRSK2,
(Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) or siYB-1#1 or siYB-1#3 or
control scramble (Darmacon, Chicago, Illinios) for 72 h.
Both RSK1 and RSK2 siRNA’s have been compared to
alternate sequences targeting each isoform and found to
have comparable knockdown and phenotypic effects [10].

Cell culture
The triple-negative breast cancer cell lines SUM149
(Asterand, Ann Arbor, MI) and MDA-MB-231 (American
Tissue Culture Collection, Manassus, VA) were grown
as previously described [5]. Primary relapsed TNBC
cells, x43, were a generous gift from Dr. John Hassell
(McMaster University, Hamilton, ON) and were cultured
in RPMI containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum plus
100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin and
0.5 μg/ml fungizone amphotericin B. All experimentation
involving human cells were done in accordance with the
Helsinki guidelines and approved through McMaster
University ethics committee.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR
RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
Mississagua, ON). SUM149 cells were treated with
DMSO or 10 μM of kaempferol, apigenin or luteolin
for 48 h. BI-D1870 (10 μM) was used as a control. The
RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using CD44
specific primers and probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) as previously described [17]. Ribosomal
mRNA was quantified as a housekeeping gene (Applied
Biosystems). Taqman Gene Expression Assays designed
for Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4 specific primers
and probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were
used with PPIA (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as
the internal control.

Immunofluorescence and western blotting
SUM149 cells were plated on 8-well multi-chamber
slides (40,000 cells/well) and treated with 10 μM of
each lead compound for 24 h. Immunofluorescence was
conducted as previously described [17] using P-YB1S102 and YB-1 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) with Alexa-Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON) secondary antibody. Images were acquired on an
Olympus BX61 microscope and analyzed using ImageJ
(NIH, Bethesda, MD). For western blotting, cell lysates
were collected after 24-72 h drug treatments or 48-96 h
siRNA treatment and immunoblotting was performed as
described previously [10, 41] using RSK1; 1:1000 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), RSK2; 1:500

as previously described [65] after 72 h. For combination
monolayer drug treatments; 5,000 SUM149 cells/well/96

combinations of luteolin (0, 10 or 25 μM) and paclitaxel

(10 μM) were added at seeding into the top layer and
colonies were counted after 28-30 d. Percent change in
growth was compared to DMSO control. Mammosphere
assays were performed as previously described [17] in
Mammocult media (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC). Additionally, serial passaging of mammospheres
(with fresh kaempferol added with each passage) and daily
repeated dosing was conducted with 10 μM kaempferol
and spheres were counted after 7 d. Growth and
mammosphere assays were performed as described above
for primary x43 cells. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/
well/96 well plate and analyzed at 72 h for monolayer
growth. For mammosphere assays x43 cells were seeded
at 20,000 cells/well and treated with DMSO, 10 or 50 μM
or BI-D1870 (10 μM) as a positive control.

NanoString gene expression profiling
RNA (100-250 ng) from breast cancer cell lines
was analyzed using the nCounter Gene Expression
Analysis system at the Centre for Translational and
Applied Genomics (CTAG) at the BC Cancer Agency
(Vancouver, BC). A custom CodeSet containing
probes for ER (RefSeq NM_000125.2), PR (RefSeq
