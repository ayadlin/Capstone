ABSTRACT
Antibiotics are common durgs with low toxicity but high effectiveness. They
have been suggested to be drug candidates for cancer therapy in recent years. Here,
we tried to investigate the antitumour effect of tigecycline on malignant melanoma.
We showed that tigecycline dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell
cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. At the same time, tigecycline suppressed cell invasion
and migration through preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.
In addition, tigecycline also significantly blocked tumor growth in vivo. Expression
of cell cycle-related proteins were investigated and resulted in downregulation of
G1/S checkpoint proteins, such as CDK2 and Cyclin E. However, cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A, p21CIP1/Waf1) was downregulated after tigecycline
treatment, which was not conformed to its conventional function. To explain this, we
overexpressed p21 in melanoma cells. We found that p21 overexpression significantly
rescued tigecycline-induced cell proliferation inhibition as well as migration and
invasion suppression. Taken together, our results revealed that the essential role of
p21 in the inhibitory effect of tigecycline on proliferation, migration and invasion of
melanoma. Tigecycline might act as a candidate therapeutic drug for treatment of
patients suffering from malignant melanoma.

with high efficiency and minimal toxicity for metastatic
melanoma. Identification of effective strategies for the
treatment of metastatic melanoma remains an urgent need.
Recent reports showed that some antibiotics
can repurpose for anti-cancer therapy [5], especially
tetracycline and their derivatives, such as minocycline and
doxycycline [6–8]. The mechanism of actions (MOAs)
of these tetracyclines in tumors are independent of their
antibacterial activity and showed diverse in different types
of tumors. For example, glioma growth inhibition by
minocycline was mediated through endoplasmic reticulum
stress-induced apoptosis and autophagy [9, 10]. But in
ovarian cancer, minocycline attenuated pro-oncogenic
factor Hif-1α expression through modulation of p53 and
AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 pathway or suppresses
interleukine-6, its receptor system and signaling pathways
[7, 8]. Another tetracycline, doxycycline, down-regulated

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma (MM) is a kind of highly
aggressive dermatological malignancy with a poor
prognosis. Over the past decades, the incidence of
malignant melanoma is increasing [1]. According to 2013
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, its
average incidence rate rose 2.6% each year for the last
decade [2]. It is considered that metastasis of melanoma
has contributed to the rising morbidity and increasing
mortality of skin neoplasms. And even in patients with
thin small primary tumors, metastasis of melanoma
occurs [3]. Until recently, despite tremendous advances
have been made in multimodality therapies including
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis for
malignant metastatic melanoma remains extremely poor
[4]. Therefore, it is time to investigate some novel drugs

DNA-PK, an essential enzyme in DNA-repair, and
radiosensitized tumor initiating cells [6]. In hepatocellular
carcinoma, doxycycline inhibited the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) and vasculogenic mimicry
[11]. And doxycycline combined with aspirin, lysine
and mifepristone can effectively and safely prevented
cancer metastasis [12]. Importantly, doxycycline induced
mitochondrial membrane potential change and apoptosis
of melanoma through ROS-ASK1-JNK pathway [13].
Besides, doxycycline induced apoptosis and inhibits
proliferation and invasion of cervical carcinoma stem cells
[14]. Above all, preclinical study showed that minocycline
combinated with sabutoclax were highly cytotoxic to
pancreatic cancer cells and safely efficacious in vivo [15].
These evidences strongly indicated that tetracyclines were
effective candidates for tumor treatment.
As one of the third-generation tetracycline
antibiotic, tigecycline is a derivative of minocycline with
a t-butylglycylamido group instead of the hydrogen at
position nine [16]. And it is approved for antibacterial
treatment in clinic by FDA in 2005 [17]. It has potential
activity to treat a wide variety of gram-positive and gramnegative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains
[18, 19]. Tigecycline is a protein synthesis inhibitor by
binding to the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit. It prevents
bacterial protein synthesis through inhibiting the binding
of a given aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome
[19]. Recent reports have shown that tigecycline had
antitumoral activity in acute myeloid leukemia and other
8 cancer types by inhibition of mitochondrial translation
or biogenesis [5, 20]. In gastric cancer, tigecycline
inhibited cell proliferation and inducing autophagy [21].
Importantly, tigecycline is non-toxic for normal cells [5].
However, the effects of tigecycline in melanoma cells are
less well studied.
In this paper, we deliberated on the function
of tigecycline in human melanoma progression and
metastasis. Our studies first put forward that tigecycline
has anti-melanoma activity through inducing proliferation
inhibition, cell cycle arrest and migration/invasion
suppression by downregulating p21. Tigecycline can act as
a candidate agent in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Then we tested the cell viability by MTT assay after 6
different dose of TIG treatment for 48 h in vitro and the
results showed that the IC50 of tigecycline in inhibition
of cell proliferation of A375 and MV3 is 7.24 uM and
10.90 uM, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1A and 1B).
We futher investigated cell growth curve by MTT assay
for 7 days after the addition of tigecycline (Figure 1D,
1E). The results showed tigecycline at 5 μM and 10 μM
dramatically decrease cell proliferation. Brdu staining
assay also showed that 10 μM tigecycline treatment for
48 h resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage
of Brdu-positive cells compared to DMSO-treated cells
(Figure 1F). These results demonstrated that tigecycline
dramatically inhibited cell growth and proliferation in
human melanoma cells.

Tigecycline induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase
in human melanoma cells
Since cell proliferation is usually regulated by the
cell cycle progression, the A375 and MV3 cells were
stained with propidium iodine (PI). Then the cell cycles
were analyzed by flow cytometry to investigate whether
tigecycline inhibited cell proliferation. Representative
histograms and the results showed that tigecycline-treated
cells resulted into a remarkable G1 phase arrest in A375
and MV3 cells, compared with the control cells (Figure
2A and 2B). The results demonstrated that tigecycline
induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. To affirm the results,
we measured the expression of CDK2 and Cyclin E which
could promote cells to go through the G1/S checkpoint by
Western blot. We found that the expression levels of cyclin
E and CDK2 were decreased in tigecycline treated cells in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2C and 2D).
Besides, we also checked other CDKs and cyclins and
the results showed that there was no significant change
of CDK4 expression, while p27, CDK6, and cyclin A
and B1 were downregulated and cyclinD1 also slightly
upregulated (Supplemental Figure 2A). These results
suggested that tigecycline induced cell cycle arrest in
human melanoma cells. All these results suggested that
tigecycline-induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.

RESULTS

Tigecycline inhibited cell migration and invasion
in human melanoma cells

Tigecycline inhibited cell growth and
proliferation in human melanoma cells

As metastasis is an important feature of melanoma,
we next explored the function of tigecycline in migration
and invasion of human melanoma cells. Cell migration
and invasion abilities were evaluated by wound healing
assay, transwell migration, invasion assay and Western
blot. Wound healing assay revealed that cells treated
with tigecycline significantly decreased the rate of
lateral migration into a wound introduced in a confluent
monolayer of cells compared with control groups

To assess the effect of tigecycline in proliferation
inhibition, different concentration of tigecycline were
treated in human melanoma A375 and MV3 cells. MTT
and Brdu assay were employed. Under the microscope,
cells was treated with different concentrations of
tigecycline for 48 h, resulted in cell proliferation inhibition
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A, 1B and 1C).

Tigecycline suppressed tumor growth in
xenograft model of human melanoma cells

(Figure 3A and 3B). Consistently, transwell migration
assay also showed that cells after tigecycline treatment
exerted seriously inbibition of the cellular transmigration ability compared with controls (Figure 3C
and 3D). In transwell invasion assay, we futher verified
that tigecycline treatment significantly decreased the
number of cells that penetrated through the Matrigelcoated membrane (Figure 3E and 3F). Consistent with
above, western blot showed that tigecycline downregulated the expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal
marker. Meanwhile tigecycline up-regulated the
expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, in a
dose-and time-dependent manner (Figure 3E, 3F). These
results indicated that tigecycline treatment reversed the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of melanoma
cells. Therefore, these results strongly demonstrated
that tigecycline-induced migration and invasiveness
inhibition.

To further assess the effects of tigecycline in colony
formation, we employed soft agar assay in vitro. The
results showed that the colonies were smaller and lesser
in tigecycline-treated cells compared with control groups
(Figure 4A and 4B). Melanoma cells A375 and MV3 were
transplanted subcutaneously into female BALA/c nude mice.
Then the mice were injected with 100 mg/kg tigecycline every
two days for 5 times after the tumor plumped. The results
showed that tigecycline treatment significantly blocked
tumor growth (Figure 4C, 4D). The mice were sacrificed at
the termination of the experiment, and the formed tumors
were excised. Similar to the above, in Figure 4E and 4F,
tigecycline remarkably inhibited the tumor growth in both
weight and size in nude mice. Treatment with tigecycline
did not affect the weight of the mice (Figure 4G and 4H)

and the appearance or behavior of the mice. To test whether
the tigecycline was also associated with cell cycle-related
proteins in vivo, the expression of CDK2 and cycline E
proteins was investigated in the xenograft tumor tissues
of A375 and MV3 cells. In consistent with our previous
results (Figure 2C and 2D), these proteins were all markedly
downregulated compared with their controls (Figure 4I).
Meanwhile, we detected the expression of EMT-related
proteins in tumors dissected from the mice. We found that
tigecycline changed relevant protein expression (Figure 4I),
which agreed with our results above (Figure 3G and 3H).
These results verified that tumor growth retardation was
accompanied with cell cycle arrest and EMT reversal after
tigecycline treatment in xenografted melanoma cells.

tigecycline treatment in a dose- and time- dependent
manner, both in mRNA and protein levels (Figure
5A–5D). These results indicated that p21 may play
an important role in tigecycline-induced cell growth
and proliferation inhibition. A375 and MV3 cells
were infected with lentiviruses encoding p21(cdkn1a)
gene, and Western blot showed that p21 expression
was upregulated after infection (Figure 5E), but the
exogenous p21 expression was not decreased significantly
after tigecycline treatment. These results confirmed
that p21 was downregulated in mRNA level. We futher
investigated cell growth curve by MTT assay for 7 days
after the addition of tigecycline or DMSO in p21/vectoroverexpressed A375 and MV3 cells. The results showed
overexpressing p21 promoted cell proliferation, and
dramatically decrease cell proliferation inhibition induced
by tigecycline (Figure 5F, 5G). Brdu assay was used to
examine the abilities of cell proliferation. The results
revealed that the proliferation ability was rescued after
p21 overexpressing in tigecycline-treated cells compared
with tigecycline-treated vector cells (Figure 5H).

The results were futher confirmed by soft agar assay in
A375 and MV3 cells. Compared to tigecycline-treated
vector groups, p21 overexpressing groups formed more
colonies in soft agar in tigecycline-treated cells, while
had no significance changes compared with DMSOtreated vector groups (Figure 5I). This indicated that

DISCUSSION
Melanoma is from the malignant proliferation
of melanocytes and is the most dangerous type of skin
cancer. More than 95% melanoma patients with three or
more metastatic sites die within 1 year [31]. During past
several decades, new targeted and immunomodulatory
therapies such as vemurafenib [32] and ipilimumab [33].
They have offered some improvements in treatment of
melanoma patients. Unfortunately, limited patients benefit
from these therapies. Most still suffer from metastatic or
relapsed disease. Tigecycline, the only FDA approved
glycylcycline [17], is a third-generation tetracycline
antibiotic. It is an effective chemotherapeutic agent for
the treatment of patients with bacterial infection. Recent
study showed that tigecycline had anti-cancer effect in
multiple tumor types, including leukemia [20], gastric
cancer [21] and other several tumor types [5]. However,
to our knowledge, the effect of tigecycline in melanoma
remains unclear.
In this study, we evaluated that the antimicrobial
agent tigecycline had anti-melanoma activity. We first
demonstrated that tigecycline significantly inhibited
tumour growth from in vivo and in vitro experiments.
MTT assays showed that tigecycline induced a
dramatically decrease in cell proliferation by a doseand time-dependent manner. Brdu assays showed a
significant reduced BrdU-positive cells. Soft agar assay
showed formed colonies were smaller and lesser after
tigecycline treatment. Xenograft experiment showed
that after tigecycline treatment, more slower and smaller
tumors formed in the nude mice. The tumor weight and
size is also significant reduced. All this findings together
indicated that tigecycline could inhibit the growth of
melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Secondarily, we found that tigecycline could
strikingly inhibit melanoma cells migration or invasion
by wound healing and transwell assays. Since EMT
has been associated with the acquisition of migration
and invasion of cancer cells [34], we detected the
expression of EMT marker, E-cadherin and vimentin
after tigecycline treatment. Results showed increased
expression of E-cadherin, and decreased expression of
vimentin. These found indicated that tigecycline inhibited
EMT of melanoma cells. All evidence above showed
that tigecycline inhibited migration and invision through
reversing EMT progression of melanoma cells.
p21CIP1/Waf1, encoded by gene cdkn1a, was the
first identified member of the cyclin-dependent kinases
inhibitors (CKIs). p21 is a multifunctional protein and
a key player in regulating different cellular processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration,
senescence, and apoptosis [35]. Conventionally, p21 has

Overexpression of p21 retrieved tigecyclineinduced cell migration and invasion suppression
in human melanoma cells
As p21 was reported to correlate with tumor
metastasis [22], we further investigated the effects
of migration and invasion in A375 and MV3 cells by
overexpressing p21. Consistent to previous report [23], we
found that the migration ability was partly rescued after
p21 overexpressing in tigecycline-treated cells (Figure 6A
and 6B), meanwhile retrieved the effects of tigecyclineinduced invasion inhibition compared with tigecyclinetreated vector cells (Figure 6C and 6D).
At the same time, we measured the EMT-related
proteins which promoted metastatic procession.
Overexpression of p21 significantly reversed the
tigecycline-induced upregulation of E-cadherin and
downregulation of vimentin (Figure 6E), indicating
the critical role of p21 in tigecycline-induced EMT
inhibition. Taken together, all the results demonstrated that
tigecycline-induced metastasis inhibition in melanoma
cells was retrieved after overexpressing of p21.

Overexpression of p21 recovered tigecycline
induced cell cycle arrest in human
melanoma cells
Our previous results showed that p21 was
decreased after tigecycline treatment (Figure 5A–5D).
p21 overexpression upregulated CDK2 and cyclin E, and
CDK2 and cyclin E downregulation were rescued by p21
overexpressing in tigecycline-treated cells (Figure 7A).
Consistent with this, G1 arrest was also recovered by p21
overexpressing in tigecycline-treated cells (Figure 7B
and 7C). That were contrary to the traditional viewpoint
that p21 was a negative cell cycle controller [24, 25].
We supposed that in melanoma, p21 might be an unsual
regulator, and several studies also showed p21 was a
tumor activator [26–28]. One explanation is that p21
promotes CDK4/6, thus activate CDK2 [29, 30]. Our data
showed that after tigecycline treatment, CDK6 expression
was sharply downregulated (Supplementary Figure 2A,
Figure 7A). And after overexpressing p21, the expression
of CDK6 was rescued (Figure 7A). These results indicated
that p21 promoted cell cycle progression in melanoma

been shown to be a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell
cyle at G1 phase with suppression of cyclin E-CDK2
activity [36, 37]. However, it has been complicated by
finding that p21 can exhibit oncogenic activities and p21
can exert CDK2 [23, 38, 39]. In the nucleus, p21 serves
as a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor. While
in the cytoplasm, it acts as an oncogene by regulating
migration, apoptosis, and proliferation [40, 41]. Contrary
to its conventional role in some tumors, p21 are correlated
with poor prognosis, increased metastasis and high
tumor grade in subsets of tumors, such as breast cancer,
prostate cancer, cervical carcinomas, lymphomas as well
as head and neck cancer [42, 43]. In oral melanomas,
p21 expression was higher than that in intramucosal nevi
[28]. Increased p21 expression levels were also found in
a subset of melanomas [27]. It also has been shown that

high levels of p21 in melanomas may be associated with
their characteristic resistance to conventional therapies
[44]. Importantly, p21 was demonstrated to protect against
p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells [26].
These evidence showed that p21 may play a different role
in melanoma. However, the exact mechanism has not been
fully explored.
In this study, overexpression of p21 significantly
rescued the tigecycline-induced proliferation inhibition,
colony formation retardation, cell cycle arrest as well
as migration and invasion suppression. Importantly,
the expression of cell cycle and EMT-related proteins
interfered by tigecycline were reversed by overexpressing
p21, to some extent, at least. p21 exert CDK2/cyclin E,
and promote cell cycle progression. As CDK2 and cyclin
E are essential during DNA synthesis in S phase [45],

BrdU incorporation reduction was also rescued after
p21 overexpression. It was reported that p21 promoted
CDK4/6, thus activated CDK2 [29]. Our Supplementary
Data Figure 2A and Figure 7A also showed that after
tigecycline treatment, CDK6 expression was sharply
downregulated. And after overexpressing p21, the
expression of CDK6 was rescued. Another study [27]
gave a possible explanation of the tolerance of increased
p21 levels found in some melanomas. They demonstrated
that p21 regulated the promoter of microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor (MITF), a transcription
factor which plays a central role in the expression of
melanocyte-specific genes, lineage determination, and
survival of melanoma cells. Besides, cytoplasmic p21
could enhanced migration is associated with metastasis
via the inhibition of the RhoA-pathway and a changed
phosphorylation level of cofilin [46]. But how p21
overexpression exerted tumor cell aggressiveness
and EMT remains a mystery. These found indicated
that tigecycline inhibited proliferation, cell cycle and
migration/invasion of human melanoma cell lines were
p21-dependent. Clearly, much more work on tigecycline
is required before we make sure the specific mechanism
of p21 underlyling in melanoma and the molecular
mechanism of actions of tigecycline induced p21
downregulation.
In summary, we firstly demonstrated that tigecycline
induced melanoma progression and metastasis inhibition
through downregulating p21, which is contrary to its
conventional role. Our studies originally indicated that
tigecycline may be an effective and promising therapeutic
agent for melanoma treatment.

Cell proliferation and viability assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell cycle assay

Cell
proliferation
was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, 2000 cells/well were plated
onto 96-well plates then the MTT assay was carried out
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubated
with tigecycline or DMSO for the indicated time, 20 μl
MTT (5 μg/ml MTT in PBS; Sigma) was added to each
well, then incubated at 37°C for 2 h and removed the
formazan complex. The absorbance was measured with
a wavelength of 560 nm after shaking for 10 min. The
experiments were carried out independently in triplicate.

Brdu staining
Cells were cultured in 24-well plate and treated
with either DMSO or tigecycilne for 24 h, incubated with
10 μg /ml thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(Brdu; Sigma) for 30 min, then washed twice with
PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min.
Afterwards, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 5 min, pre-treated with 1 mol/L HCl for
10 min, blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h, then a
monoclonal rat primary antibody against BrdU (1:300,
ab6326, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was incubated
for 1 h , followed by Alexa FluorR® 594 goat anti-rat IgG
secondary antibody, (H+L; Invitrogen). DAPI (300 nM)
was used for nucleus staining, then the percentage of
BrdU was calculated. In the end, More than 8 microscopic
fields were taken (Nikon 80i, Nikon Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan).

Cells were cultured in 6-cm dishes (3 × 105 per dish)
for 24 h and then treated with either 10 μM tigecycline
or DMSO. After 48 h theatment, cells were washed with
cold PBS, and then fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at
4°C. Subsquently, the cells were mixed with RNaseA and
stained with propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA) at room temperature for 30 min in the
dark after washing twice with PBS, followed by using
a FACS C6 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) with
CellQuest software to analysis. The data were analyzed
with FlowJo7.6 software. The experiments were repeated
more than three times.

Cell culture
Human melanoma cell lines (A375 and MV3) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, cell lines A375 was
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). MV3 was
maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640
(RPMI-1640; Gibco). They were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin (P/S). Cells were cultured at 37°C in
humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

Drug treatment

Wound-healing assays

Tigecycline (TIG, Wyeth, Canada) was dissolved in
Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) as 100 mM stock solutions.
Human melanoma cell lines A375 and MV3 were treated
with tigecycline at indicated concentrations or times. The
cell morphology were taken by the Olympus microscopy
(Olympus, Japan). Cell vitality was analyzed by Trypan
blue exclusion assay.

Cells were cultured in 24-well plate and reached
full of confluence, then the monolayer of the cells were
scratched using a yellow pipette tip. Subsequently, PBS
was used to wash and remove floating and damaged cells,
and serum-free medium with 10 μM tigecycline or DMSO
were added to cells for culture. Cells migrated over the
denuded area were observed and pictures were taken at

measured at the indicated time points.

cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The cdkn1a and
cdkn1b mRNA transcripts were determined using
the SYBER Green PCR Master mix (Takara) by
quantitative RT-PCR. RT-qPCR reactions in triplicate
were conducted using the LightCycler96 real-time PCR
system (Roche). The individual values were normalized
to that of the GAPDH control. Cdkn1a forward primer:
AGTCAGTTCCTTGTGGAGCC;
reverse
primer:
CCGCAGAAACACCTGTGAAC.

Cell migration and invasion
The migration assay was conducted in a 24-well
transwell cell culture apparatus fitted with multiporous
polycarbonate membrane insert (8-μm pore size)
(Corning). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into the
upper well of the insert with 200 μl media of 1% serum,
500 μl media contained 10% FBS were added as a
chemoattractant. All media contains 10 μM tigecycline
or DMSO. After incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator
for 24 h, the chamber were rinsed three times with PBS,
nonmigrating cells from the top wells were removed
by cotton swabs. Cells on the lower membrane surface
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with
0.5% crystal violet. Migrating cells was observered by
560 nm absorbance after blenched with 33% acetic acid.
The transwell invasion assays were done under the same
conditions as the transwell migration assays, but the
top chamber of transwell were coated by 50 ul Matrigel
(10 mg/mL, Corning) with 2 × 104 cells/ml and the lower
chamber with 20% FBS, then incubated for 72 h. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and migration/
invasion rate was normalized by proliferation rate.

Soft agar colony formation assay
Colony formation ability was determined by soft
agar assay on A375 and MV3 cells. Briefly, 1.5 ml DMEM
or RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.6% agarose were
added to each well of a six-well culture plates and allowed
to solidify (base agar). 1 × 103 of A375 and MV3 cells
were then mixed with 1ml DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium
containing 0.3% agarose and added to the top of base agar
(top agar). The cells were cultured for 14 to 21 days at
37°C under 5% carbon dioxide. At the end, cells were
stained with MTT, then imaged using a digital camera.
Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted using the
inverted microscope.

Tumor xenografts

Western blot assay

4 weeks old female nude mice (BALA/c), (Beijing
laboratory animal research center, China) were purchased
and housed in the SPF room to acclimate for a week.
Melanoma cells A375 and MV3 cells (1 × 106) in 100 ul
DMEM or 1640 were subcutaneously injected into both
flanks of each mouse respectively. After 14 days tumor
growth, the mice were divided into two groups randomly.
One group was injected intraperitoneally with tigecycline
at 100 mg/kg (mice body weight), meanwhile, the other
group was injected with DMSO as a control every two
days for 5 times. Tumor growth was measured by caliper
measurement daily, and tumor volume was then calculated
with the formula (volume = tumor length × width2 ×
0.5236) after tumor plumped. At the termination of the
experiment, tumors were removed, weighed. All animal
experiments were pre-approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of the Southwest
University.

A375 and MV3 melanoma cell lines were
harvested, then suspended in RIPA Lysis Buffer. Protein
concentrations were detected with BCA protein assay
kit (Beyotime Biotech, China). The lysates from cells
as well as the fresh tissues were separated by SDSPAGE, followed by transferring onto PVDF membranes
(Millipore, USA). Followed by blocking with 5% BSA,
the PVDF membranes were incubated gently with a
primary antibody against human GAPDH (1:1000,
Beyotime), p21 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), CDK2 (1:1000,
Cell Signaling), Cyclin E (1:1000, Cell Signaling),
E-cadherin (1:1000, Cell Signaling) and vimentin (1:1000,
Cell Signaling) at 4°C overnight, followed by appropriate
(horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody)
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. HRP-labeled
goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (A0216, 1:2000) and goat
anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (A0208 1:2000) were used as
secondary antibodies which purchased from Beyotime.
Proteins were visualized by ECL Western blot analysis
system. The signal was captured by the ECL reagent
(Beyotime) and visualized by Western blotting detection
instruments (Clinx Science).

Vector construction and infection
Human full length p21 cDNA was obtain from
NCBI (NM_000389.4), the DNA fragment was then
cloned into PCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-puro vector to
generate the recombinant plasmid. The p21 overexpression
vectors were transfected into 293FT cells by using the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), subsequently, the Lentivirus were infected into
Human melanoma cells according to the manufacturer’s

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Takara
Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and mRNA was reverse transcribed into
