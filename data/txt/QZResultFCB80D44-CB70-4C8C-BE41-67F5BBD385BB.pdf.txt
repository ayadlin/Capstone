Regulating Apoptosis and Autophagy

Abstract
The p53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits glycolysis, resulting in higher intracellular
NADPH, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy activity. In this study, we investigated whether
TIGAR might exert dual impacts on cancer cell survival based on its ability to inhibit both apoptosis and
autophagy. In liver or lung cancer cells treated with the anticancer drug epirubicin, TIGAR levels increased in a
dose- and time-dependent manner. TIGAR silencing enhanced epirubicin-induced elevations in ROS levels and
apoptosis rates, in a manner that was blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH or N-acetyl cysteine. These ﬁndings
were correlated with reduced tumorigenicity and increased chemosensitivity in mouse xenograft tumor assays. In
parallel, TIGAR silencing also enhanced the epirubicin-induced activation of autophagy, in a manner that was also
blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH. Notably, TIGAR silencing also licensed epirubicin-mediated inactivation
of the mTOR pathway, suggesting TIGAR also exerted a negative impact on autophagy. However, genetic or
pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy increased epirubicin-induced apoptosis in TIGAR-silenced cells. Overall,
our results revealed that TIGAR inhibits both apoptosis and autophagy, resulting in a dual impact on tumor cell
survival in response to tumor chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5127–38. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor-suppressor gene TP53 plays an important role in
the regulation of cellular metabolism, speciﬁcally glycolysis
and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via transcriptional
regulation of its downstream genes TP53-induced glycolysis
regulator (TIGAR) and synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase
(SCO2; refs. 1 and 2). It has been known that cancer cells
utilize glycolysis, which yields less ATP and can occur in
hypoxic tissues that cannot obtain sufﬁcient ATP through
oxidation/phosphorylation. A theory has been proposed to
explain this phenomenon known as "the Warburg effect" (3).
The role of TP53 in the regulation of energy metabolism
through TIGAR and SCO2 provides new insights into the

puzzles of cancer cell metabolism and strategies for cancer
therapy (4).
TIGAR functions to lower fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru2,6-P2) levels in cells, resulting in an inhibition of glycolysis (5).
The TIGAR protein shows similarity to the bisphosphatase
domain of PFK-2/FBPase-2 (6-phos-phofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), an enzyme that has an essential
function in the regulation of glycolysis (5, 6). The concept of
Warburg effect depict that cancer cells preferentially utilize the
glycolytic pathway to produce ATP even in the presence of
oxygen, thus the ability of TIGAR to inhibit cell glycolysis seems
to be harmful for cancer cell survival. However, a number of
recent studies have reported that TIGAR expression was
signiﬁcantly elevated in human cancers such as glioblastoma
(7), invasive breast cancers (8), and colorectal cancers (unpublished observations). The question that urgently needs to be
addressed is why cancer cells need more TIGAR if their survival
is dependent on glycolysis?
TIGAR also functions to decrease intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels through increasing NADPH generation. ROS-adaptive response may play a critical role in
protecting cells against cytotoxic effects of anticancer agents
(9, 10) and high intracellular concentrations of glutathione
(GSH) have been implicated in resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents (5). Bensaad and colleagues reported that
TIGAR protects cells from ROS-associated apoptosis (5). These
may be the reason why the cancer cells need high levels of
TIGAR for survival. On the other hand, TIGAR-mediated ROS
reduction may limit autophagy activity. Considering autophagy can function to decrease ROS levels, inhibit apoptosis and
support energy production in nutrient starvation or metabolic
stress conditions (11), the impact of TIGAR-mediated

autophagy inhibition in tumor cell survival remains to be
investigated. In addition, whether TIGAR plays a role in
autophagy regulation independent of ROS also needs to be
deﬁned. A more complete understanding the role of TIGAR in
ROS and autophagy regulation will pave a new avenue for
developing new chemotherapeutic drugs. This study provides
the evidence showing that TIGAR has dual roles in chemosensitivity of tumor cells through inhibition of apoptosis and
autophagy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human lung cancer cell line A549 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma derived HepG2 cells were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection and cultured with
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM; GIBCO,
11965500) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; WISTEN
Inc., 086150008), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 IU/mL streptomycin in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C under 5% CO2
atmosphere, and passaged at preconﬂuent densities by use of
0.25% trypsin solution every 2 to 3 days. Cells were stored and
used within 3 months after resuscitation of frozen aliquots.
Measurement of cell viability
The short-term effects of epirubicin or TIGAR knockdown
on tumor cell growth was assessed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma, M5655)
assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (1,000 cells per well)
in complete DMEM. Cells were treated with 1.25 to 20 mg/mL
epirubicin (Pﬁzer; 10 mg per bottle) or vehicle for 12 to 48 hours
and then subjected to MTT assay. Percentage of growth
inhibition was calculated as (ODvehicle  ODtreatment)/ODvehicle
 100%, where OD was measured at 570 nm with a microplate
reader (BieTek). In each experiment, quintuplicate wells were
used for each drug concentration, and assays were repeated in
three independent experiments.
The long-term effects of TIGAR knockdown on tumor cell
proliferation was analyzed with colony-formation assay. Cells
transfected with TIGAR siRNA after 12 hours were plated in 6well plates at a density of 200 cells per well and epirubicin was
added 24 hours later. Medium was changed every 3 days. After
14 days, the colonies were stained with Giemsa for 15 minutes
and rinsed with deionized distilled water, photographed using
a Nikon D800 digital camera (36.3 megapixel; Nikon Corp.) and
scored using Image J software (W.S. Rasband, Image J, NIH,
Bethesda, MD).
Transfection and RNA interference
To inhibit TIGAR expression, 2 small interference RNAs
(siRNA) matching region 115 to 133 in exon 3 (GCAGCAGCTGCTGGTATAT; TIGAR siRNA1) and region 565 to
583 in exon 6 (TTAGCAGCCAGTGTCTTAG; TIGAR siRNA2)
of the human TIGAR cDNA sequence were synthesized by
GenePharma, and a scramble sequence (TTACCGAGACCGTACGTAT) was synthesized as a negative control. To inhibit
autophagy, ATG5 siRNAs (GCAACTCTGGATGGGATTG,
ATG5 siRNA1; CATCTGAGCTACCCGGATA, ATG5 siRNA2)
were also synthesized.

A method called reverse transit transfection was adapted for
transient transfection using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, 11668019). HepG2 or A549 cells were added directly to the Lipofectamine 2000-TIGAR siRNAs or ATG5 siRNAs
complexes diluted in Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium
(GIBCO, 31985070) and transfection occurred while cells were
attaching to the wall of well. For A549 cells, cells were plated at
a density of 5  105 cells in 6-well plates and, were then
transfected with TIGAR siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent diluted in Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium 24
hours later. The ﬁnal concentration of TIGAR siRNA and ATG5
siRNA was 80 and 40 nmol/L. Complete medium was added to
each well 6 hours after transfection. Cells were trypsinized and
harvested for Western blot analysis or ﬂow cytometry at the
indicated times.
To assess the transfection efﬁciency, HepG2 cells were
transfected with LV-TIGAR-shRNA (TIGAR#2:50 -GATTAGCAGCCAGTGTCTTAG-30 ; TIGAR#3: 50 -GCTTACATGAGAAGTCTGTTT-30 ; Genechem) and 72 hours after transfection, the
expression of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) was detected
with a ﬂuorescence microscopy. The transfection efﬁciency
was estimated about 90%. For establish stable TIGAR knockdown cells, HepG2 cells were transfected with LV-TIGARshRNA (Genechem) and were selected in cell culture medium
containing 1 mg/mL poromycin for 1 week. The efﬁciency of
TIGAR knockdown was determined with Western blot analysis.
Cells were then cultured in culture medium for in vivo xenograft experiments.
Flow cytometry detection of apoptosis and ROS
Cell apoptosis was quantiﬁed with double staining of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI; Biouniquer, BU-AP0103). Ten thousands
cells per sample were acquired with a FACScan ﬂow cytometer
(FACScan). Freshly trypsinized cells were pooled, washed twice
with binding buffer, and processed following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells ﬂuorescence was analyzed with ﬂow
cytometry using the Cell Quest Pro software (Beckman
Coulter).
20 ,70 -Dichloro-dihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA,
Molecular Probes) was metabolized by nonspeciﬁc esterases
to the nonﬂuorescence product, 20 ,70 -dichloro-dihydroﬂuoresceine, which was oxidized to the ﬂuorescent product DCF by
ROS. ROS levels were determined by incubating the cells with
cell culture medium containing 10 mmol/L H2-DCFDA for 30
minutes at 37 C. Then, the cells were washed twice in PBS,
trypsinized, resuspended in PBS, and measured for ROS content with FACS (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). Assays were
performed in triplicates and were repeated in three independent experiments.
Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from cells using cell lysis solution
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, 04693159001)
and phosphorylase inhibitors (Roche, 04906845001). Protein
concentration was determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce, 23227). Equal amounts of protein were fractionated
on Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to

with 0.1% Tween 20, washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBST), and then incubated overnight at 4 C with speciﬁc
antibodies against TP53 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology,

#9451) in nonfat milk containing 0.1% NaN3. After washing
in TBST, membranes were incubated with ﬂuorescence
secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch,
anti-rabbit, 711-035-152, anti-mouse, 715-035-150) at room
temperature for 1 hour. Immunoreactivity was detected using
Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-COR Biosciences). The signal
intensity of primary antibody binding was quantitatively analyzed with Image J software (W.S. Rasband, Image J, NIH) and
was normalized to a loading control b-actin (1:4,000; Sigma,
A5441).
Evaluation of LC3 ﬂuorescent puncta
HepG2 cells were seeded onto cover glass (Fisher Scientiﬁc,
#032910-9) in 24-well plate and were transfected with scramble
siRNA, TIGAR siRNA1, or TIGAR siRNA2 24 hours later. Cells
were treated with or without the treatment of 5 mg/mL
epirubicin for 12 hours. After 72 hours of transfection, cells
were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked in PBS containing 1% normal bovine
serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room
temperature. Cells were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal
anti-LC3 antibody (Abcam, ab62721) followed by incubation
with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200;
Boster, BA1105). After 1-hour incubation and several rinses,
cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes. Sections were then washed in
PBS and cover slipped with ﬂuoromount Aqueous Mounting
Medium (Sigma, F4680). The slides were analyzed with Nikon
C1 plus laser scanning confocal microscopy (Nikon D-Eclipse
C1 plus). Six ﬁelds were analyzed for each of the samples
stained with a given antibody, and the number of LC3 puncta/
cell was evaluated as the total number of dots divided by the
number of nuclei in each microscopic ﬁeld and at least 150 cells
were examined in each treatment. Duplicates of three independent experiments were analyzed for each group.
Transmission electron microscopy
HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected
with TIGAR siRNA2 or scramble siRNA for 72 hours, epirubicin
was applied 12 hours before the end of transfection. Cells were
then ﬁxed for 2 hours with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), postﬁxed in 1% OsO4 dehydrated
in graded ethanol and then embedded in epoxy resin. Blocks
were cut on an ultramicrotome into ultrathin sections, which
were poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and
viewed under a Hitachi 7100 electron microscopy.

Redox-state analysis
For GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) measurement, a GSH
and GSSG Assay Kit (Beyotime) was used according to the
manufacturer's protocol. NADPH levels of cells were detected
with enzychromTM NADPþ/NADPH Assay Kit (ECNP-100;
BioAssay Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
In vivo tumor growth analysis
HepG2 cells and stable TIGAR knockdown HepG2 cells (1 
106) were subcutaneously inoculated into the right oxter of 6week-old female athymic nude mice (Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.). Two weeks after tumor formation, 2
mg/kg epirubicin was intraperitoneally administrated every 3
days for another 2 weeks, and then mice were anesthetized and
photographed. After the mice were sacriﬁced, the tumors were
removed and photographed and weighted. Tumor proteins
were extracted for Western blot analysis. All animal procedures
were approved and monitored by the local Animal Care and
Use Committee in Soochow University (License NO. Syxk;
Su-0062).
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as means  SEM. Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism software
statistical package (GraphPad Software). When a signiﬁcant
group effect was found, post hoc comparisons were performed
using the Newman–Keuls t test to examine special group
differences. Independent group t tests were used for comparing
two groups. Signiﬁcant differences at P < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001
are indicated by  ,  ,  , respectively. All calculations were
performed using the 14.0 SPSS software package (SPSS Inc.).

Results
Epirubicin-induced TIGAR expression
Epirubicin, a DNA-damaging anticancer agent induced
growth inhibition in both HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A) and A549 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. To detect TIGAR expression in response to
epirubicin treatment, HepG2 cells were seeded onto 6-well
plates for 24 hours and were then treated with different
concentrations of epirubicin (1.25–20 mg/mL) for 12 hours or
5.0 mg/mL epirubicin for different length of time (12–48 hours).
An increase in TIGAR protein levels was observed at the low
concentration of epirubicin (1.25–5 mg/mL), but returned to
that of control levels at 10 mg/mL (Fig. 1C). A time-course study
showed that TIGAR expression was elevated at 12 to 24 hours,
but quickly declined and fell down to that of control at 36 hours
(Fig. 1E). As TIGAR was known as a TP53-inducible gene, the
expression of TP53 in HepG2 cells treated with different
concentrations of epirubicin or 5.0 mg/mL epirubicin for
different length of time was detected with immunoblotting.
The results showed that the elevated expression of TIGAR
correlated with the expression of TP53 as seen in Fig. 1B and D.
Similar results were obtained in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1B–E). To further investigate whether the elevation of TIGAR
was correlated with the increased expression of TP53, PFTa, a
TP53 inhibitor was used. Western blot analysis showed that
expression of Bax and TIGAR were decreased in a time- and

dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2), which indicated that TIGAR induction was dependent on TP53 in HepG2
cells.
Based on these observations, we treated HepG2 and A549
cells with 5 mg/mL epirubicin for 12 hours in rest of experiments, as this treatment protocol induced a minor inhibition of
cell viability but a signiﬁcant increase in TIGAR protein levels.
Downregulation of TIGAR-enhanced epirubicin-induced
apoptosis
To investigate the effects of TIGAR on the cell growth of
HepG2 and A549 cells, 2 different TIGAR siRNA molecules
(TIGAR siRNA1, TIGAR siRNA2) were designed to silence
TIGAR expression. HepG2 cells were transfected with scramble
siRNA, TIGAR siRNA1 or TIGAR siRNA2 at the concentration of
80 nmol/L for 72 hours. The transfection efﬁciency was 90%
as detected with a ﬂuorescence microscopy (Supplementary
Fig. S3A) Western blot analysis of TIGAR protein levels showed
89% and 91% of silencing efﬁciency with TIGAR siRNA1 and
TIGAR siRNA2, respectively (Fig. 2A). A 65.6% (TIGAR siRAN1)
and 71.2% (TIGAR siRNA2) of silencing efﬁciency was also
detected in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The shortterm effect of TIGAR knockdown on cell growth was
examined with an MTT assay in both A549 and HepG2 cells.
Knockdown of TIGAR had no signiﬁcant effect on the cell

proliferation under normal condition. However, TIGAR knockdown signiﬁcantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of epirubicin on growth of HepG2 cells, suggesting a protective effect of
TIGAR on cancer cell survival (Fig. 2B). Similar effects were
obtained in A549 cells with combination of TIGAR knockdown
and epirubicin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3C). To evaluate the long-term effect of TIGAR knockdown on cell proliferation, colony-formation assay was used. The formation of
clones of HepG2 cells after TIGAR knockdown was only slightly
reduced under normal condition. The epirubicin-induced
inhibition of the colony formation was greatly enhanced by
knockdown of TIGAR (Fig. 2C and D).
To further investigate whether downregulation of TIGAR
enhances the chemosensitivity of HepG2 and A549 cells, we
analyzed apoptosis of HepG2 and A549 cells in response to
epirubicin after knockdown of TIGAR. TIGAR interference
enhanced the apoptotic index when HepG2 cells treated with
5.0 mg/mL epirubicin compared with those treated with epirubicin alone (Fig. 2E and F). Similar effects of TIGAR knockdown on epirubicin-induced apoptosis were observed in A549
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Furthermore, this study
showed that knockdown of TIGAR promoted apoptosis partly
through the activation of the conventional caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathway with a signiﬁcant enhancement in the
activation of caspase 3 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The

apoptosis was inhibited with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). These results
suggest that TIGAR knockdown enhances the chemosensitivity of tumor cells to epirubicin.
Inhibition of TIGAR expression reduced tumorigenicity
and enhanced chemosensitivity to epirubicin in vivo
To evaluate the effects of TIGAR on tumor growth and
chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma to epirubicin,
a xenograft nude mouse model was used. HepG2 cells with
stable TIGAR knockdown (Fig. 3A and B) were inoculated into
the right oxter of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice. A mild
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo was observed in stable
TIGAR knockdown cells as compared with vector-transfected

cells. Epirubicin treatment (2 mg/kg) reduced tumor size and
the effect was substantially enhanced in the stable TIGAR
knockdown group (Fig. 3C–E). The reduced expression of
TIGAR was conﬁrmed with GFP-ﬂuorescence (Fig. 3F) and
Western blot analysis (Fig. 3G). These in vivo results revealed
that inhibition of TIGAR expression can reduce tumorigenicity
and enhance the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma
to epirubicin.

with TIGAR siRNAs and treated with epirubicin. The results
showed that ROS levels were slightly increased in HepG2 cells

was attributable to the increased cellular ROS levels, NADPH

was supplemented to HepG2 cells. Cells were transfected with
TIGAR siRNA2 and were treated with 10 mmol/L NADPH
1 hour before epirubicin treatment. Addition of NADPH signiﬁcantly reduced ROS levels in cells transfected with TIGAR
siRNA2 and treated with epirubicin (Fig. 4A and B). Similar
results were seen with the ROS scavenger NAC (Supplementary
Fig. S5A and B). GSH/GSSG and NADPH levels after TIGAR

treated with 5 mg/mL epirubicin (Fig. 4C and D). These effects
were partly blocked with supplementation of 10 mmol/L NAC 1
hour before epirubicin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5C and
D). The colony-formation assay also showed a protective effect
of NAC on tumor cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S5E). Apoptosis of HepG2 cells after TIGAR knockdown with or without
treatment of 5 mg/mL epirubicin was signiﬁcantly reduced
after applying of NADPH (Fig. 4E); however, compared with
control cells, the apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells treated with 5.0
mg/mL epirubicin after TIGAR knockdown with addition of
NADPH was still higher than that of epirubicin alone, suggesting that enhancement of chemosensitivity by knockdown of
TIGAR is partially mediated by elevation of ROS levels.
TIGAR knockdown enhanced epirubicin-induced
autophagy activation
To investigate the effects of epirubicin on autophagy,
HepG2 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates for 24 hours and
were then treated with different concentrations of epirubicin
(1.25–20 mg/mL) for 12 hours or 5 mg/mL epirubicin for
different length of time (12–48 hours). The data showed that
autophagy was activated if treated with higher concentration
(10–20 mg/mL) of epirubicin for longer time (36–48 hours)
with increases in LC3- II/LC3-I ratio and decreases in p62
levels (Fig. 5A–D). It was reported that TIGAR can inhibit
autophagy through downregulating ROS levels. To determine

www.aacrjournals.org

whether autophagy was activated by knockdown of TIGAR,
HepG2 cells were left untreated or treated with 5 mg/mL
epirubicin with or without TIGAR knockdown and the LC3
levels were detected with Western blot analysis. The results
showed that knockdown of TIGAR alone did not signiﬁcantly
increase the LC3-I/LC3-II ratio. Treatment of HepG2 cells
with epirubicin (5 mg/mL) did not signiﬁcantly induce activation of autophagy at the time examined. However, knockdown of TIGAR resulted in signiﬁcant activation of autophagy
after treatment of epirubicin (Fig. 5E). Meanwhile, the greater
increase in the LC3 ﬂuorescence intensity and the number of
LC3 patches were seen in HepG2 cells after treatment with
epirubicin and TIGAR knockdown (Fig. 5F). The greater
decrease in p62 was also found to in response to epirubicin
treatment after TIGAR knockdown (Fig. 5G). To further
conﬁrm the enhancement of autophagy activity by knockdown of TIGAR, HepG2 cells were transfected with scramble
siRNA or TIGAR siRNA2 with or without treatment of epirubicin and electron microscopy was used to detect the
formation of autophagosomes. Results showed that compared
with control, the formation of auatophagosomes was detected
in HepG2 cells after TIGAR knockdown or treated with 5.0
mg/mL epirubicin; however, the increased number of autophagosomes, secondary lysosomes, and vacuolated mitochondria were seen in HepG2 cells treated with combined epirubicin and TIGAR knockdown (Fig. 6). These results suggest

an enhancement in the autophagy activation by TIGAR
knockdown in response to epirubicin treatment.
To further investigate whether this enhanced autophagy
activity after TIGAR knockdown was caused by the elevation of
ROS levels, HepG2 cells transfected with TIGAR siRNA2 were
treated with NADPH 2 hours before the treatment of 5.0 mg/mL
epirubicin. Results showed that the increment of epirubicininduced autophagy activity by TIGAR knockdown was partially
inhibited with supplementation of NADPH (Fig. 5H). This
suggests that in addition to ROS, other mechanisms may be
involved in TIGAR-mediated autophagy regulation (11). As
mTOR is a major regulator of autophagy, the inhibition of
which has been shown to induce activation of autophagy in
response to nutrient starvation (12), we then detected the
phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream protein S6 and
4EBP1 in response to epirubicin after TIGAR knockdown.
Results showed that silencing TIGAR expression alone had no
signiﬁcant effect on phosphorylation of mTOR under normal
condition. Treatment of HepG2 cells with epirubicin caused a

5134

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

robust increase in the levels of phosphorylated mTOR but not
its downstream S6 and 4EBP1. However, knockdown of TIGAR
almost completely blocked the phosphorylation of mTOR
induced by epirubicin (Fig. 7A). Moreover, knockdown of
TIGAR reduced phosphorylated S6 and 4EBPI below the control levels after combined epirubicin treatment (Fig. 7B and C).
These results indicate that TIGAR may have a direct regulatory
role in the mTOR signaling pathway.
Inhibition of autophagy enhanced TIGAR knockdown–
induced increases in apoptosis
To investigate whether the activation of autophagy induced
by TIGAR knockdown affects chemosensitivity of epirubicin, 3MA, an autophagy inhibitor that has been reported to inhibit
the activity of PI3 kinase and block the formation of autophagosomes, was applied 12 hours before the end of the treatment.
After applying 3-MA, the rate of apoptosis of HepG2 cells
treated with 5 mg/mL epirubicin and TIGAR knockdown was
signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 7D and E). Colony-formation assay

also showed a decrease in clones after autophagy was inhibited
by 3-MA. It has reported that 3-MA has dual role in modulation
of autophagy via different temporal patterns of inhibition on
class I and class III PI3K (13). To further investigate the effects
of autophagy induced by TIGAR knockdown on cell apoptosis
and chemosensitivity, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with
ATG5 siRNA and TIGAR siRNA for 48 hours. The cotransfection
efﬁciency was 62.33% for Atg5 and was 72.05% for TIGAR (Fig.
7F). HepG2 cells cotransfected with ATG5 siRNA and TIGAR
siRNA were then treated with 5 mg/mL epirubicin for 12 hours
and the cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. The results
showed that inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG5 in
TIGAR-silenced HepG2 cells, cell survival was greatly reduced
after the treatment with epirubicin (Fig. 7G). These results
suggested that enhanced autophagy activity induced by TIGAR
knockdown reduces the cytotoxicity of epirubicin.

Discussion
Alteration of energy metabolism is one of the hallmarks of
cancer cells and has recently inspired particular interest in
investigating regulation of metabolic pathways in cancer chemotherapy (14). The increased dependency of cancer cells on
the glycolytic pathway for ATP generation provides a biochemical basis for the design of therapeutic strategies to preferen-

www.aacrjournals.org

tially kill cancer cells by pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis.
Thus development of novel glycolytic inhibitors as a new class
of anticancer agents is likely to have broad therapeutic applications (15). Several glycolysis inhibitors are now in preclinical
and clinical development, such as lactate dehydrogenase A
inhibitor FX11 (16) or hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxy-glucose
(15, 17) and lonidamine (18). The function of TIGAR as a kind of
glycolytic inhibitor seems to be unfavorable to cancer cell
survival from the view of glycolysis. However, recent studies
showed that TIGAR was overexpressed in several types of
cancer cells, and its expression was favorable to tumor cell
survival (5). The role and mechanisms by which TIGAR affect
cancer cell survival need to be further studied.
To determine the response and role of TIGAR in cancer cells
with relation to chemotherapy, this study investigated the
regulation of chemosensitivity by TIGAR in HepG2 and
A549 cells. Consistent with the previous ﬁndings (5, 19, 20),
TIGAR expression in A549 and HepG2 cells was elevated
following treatment with epirubicin in face of mild or transient
stress. TIGAR knockdown mildly decreased the cell viability,
partially because of the increased rate of apoptosis. Furthermore, the epirubicin-induced decline in cell viability and the
increase in apoptosis were greatly enhanced when TIGAR was
knocked down. These studies suggest a protective effect of

tumorigenicity and an increase in chemosensitivity to epirubicin after TIGAR knockdown, suggesting TIGAR may be a
therapeutic target for cancer therapy.

Spitz and colleagues reported that cancer cells produced
greater amount of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide than
normal cells (21, 22). To reduce the hydroperoxide toxiﬁcation, the pentose pathway was upregulated to produce more
NADPH. TIGAR can inhibit glycolysis; however, this effect

TIGAR Inhibits Apoptosis and Autophagy

may be masked by other regulatory mechanisms in tumor
cells. In agreement with Spitz and colleagues (21, 22), we
observed the lactate production was increased in colon
cancer tissues compared with corresponding normal tissues.
We also observed a high expression of G6PD in colon cancer
tissues alone with TIGAR over expression (unpublished
observations); thus, TIGAR can increase the generation of
NADPH by promoting the ﬂow of the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP). To investigate whether TIGAR knockdown–
induced enhancement in chemosensitivity is caused by the
increases in ROS, total cellular ROS levels, GSH/GSSG ratio,
and NADPH levels were detected. The increases in ROS levels
and decreases in GSH/GSSG ratio or NADPH levels were
found, which conﬁrmed the role of TIGAR in suppressing
ROS production. To further conﬁrm that the enhanced
apoptosis to epirubicin after TIGAR knockdown was mediated by elevation of cellular ROS, NADPH and NAC were
applied. The results demonstrated that cell apoptosis was
apparently reduced if the NADPH or NAC was added to cells.
However, the apoptotic rate of cancer cells treated with
NADPH after TIGAR knockdown was still higher than that
of the control cells, indicating other mechanisms are also
involved in TIGAR-regulated chemosensitivity. Caspase-3,
an important death protease (23) was found to be activated
in cells transfected with TIGAR siRNA or treated with
epirubicin, this effect was also ampliﬁed with combination
of TIGAR knockdown and epirubicin. Cell apoptosis induced
by TIGAR knockdown, epirubicin, or combination of both
was partially rescued after supplementation of Z-VAD-FMK,
a pan-caspase inhibitor. It suggests that the promotion of
chemosensitivity by TIGAR knockdown is more or less
because of the activation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.
Recent reports showed that TIGAR expression was correlated with the ex vivo sensitivity of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells to ﬂudarabine (24). Lui and colleagues demonstrated that TIGAR/NADPH cascade was involved in antitumor effects of a new c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting
that inhibition of TIGAR may have an antitumor potentiality
(25). ECyd, an RNA-directed nucleoside anti-metabolite, elicits
its antitumor effect via TIGAR downregulation (26). Wanka
and colleagues demonstrated that TIGAR was elevated shortly
after irradiation, and silencing TIGAR expression resulted in
cell viability inhibition and the damniﬁcation of DNA repair in
glioblastoma cell lines, with the possibility to enhance radiosensitization (20). In consistent with these ﬁndings, this
study suggests that TIGAR may be a valuable target for
chemotherapy.
Bensaad and colleagues demonstrated that TIGAR can
modulate ROS in response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress, and functions to inhibit autophagy (11). Ling Ye
and colleagues, reported that knockdown of TIGAR induced
apoptosis and autophagy in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (27). How does TIGAR inﬂuence autophagy activity
and its consequence on cell viability, however, is not clearly
deﬁned. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for degradation of intracellular substances, responsible
for the recycle of metabolic substances and the maintenance

www.aacrjournals.org

of intracellular stability (28). Whether autophagy kills or
protects cancer cells is complex (29). In most chemotherapeutic strategies, elevation of autophagy activity in varying
degrees after treatment could be observed (30). This can be
considered as a protective strategy for tumor cells to avoid
being entirely killed by drugs. The pro-survival ability of
autophagy renders tumor cells resistant to anticancer drugs,
which greatly compromises curative efﬁcacy of chemotherapy. A complex interplay between apoptosis and autophagy
has also been reported (31). In many cases, autophagy can
inhibit apoptosis by removing damaged mitochondria, preventing the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of the
apoptotic cascade in cancer cells (32, 33). In agreement with
other investigators (11, 27), knockdown of TIGAR alone only
slightly increased autophagy activity, but signiﬁcantly
enhanced epirubicin-induced autophagy activation. To
explore the effects of activated autophagy on cell viability
after TIGAR knockdown, 3-MA or ATG5 siRNA was implied.
Inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA or ATG5 knockdown
further increased the epirubicin-induced apoptosis when
TIGAR was knocked down, which suggests a protective effect
of autophagy on cancer cell survival.
It has been proposed that TIGAR affects autophagy as a
result of reduction in ROS. In this study, NADPH partially
blocked TIGAR knockdown–induced enhancement of
autophagy activity, suggesting additional mechanisms may
be involved. This study found that knockdown of TIGAR
alone had no signiﬁcant effect on mTOR but robustly
decreased the epirubicin-induced the phosphorylation of
mTOR and its downstream protein S6 and 4EBP1. This
ﬁnding suggests that TIGAR may inﬂuence autophagy activity through regulating ROS levels and a direct inhibitory
effect on the mTOR pathway.
In summery, TIGAR was induced by epirubicin. Knockdown of TIGAR expression by siRNA enhanced the antitumor effects of epirubicin with increased cellular ROS levels,
active caspase-3 and the rate of apoptosis. The effects can be
partially blocked by supplementing NADPH or NAC. Knockdown of TIGAR slightly increased activation of autophagy
but signiﬁcantly enhanced epirubicin-induced autophagy
activation. The TIGAR knockdown–induced autophagy activation involved in elevation of ROS and inhibition of mTOR.
Inhibition of autophagy activity enhanced epirubicininduced apoptosis. Therefore, TIGAR exerts dual effects on
survival of tumor cells, with one favorable effect mediated by
reducing ROS and an unfavorable effect because of reducing
autophagy activity. However, based on current information,
the predominant role of TIGAR on cancer cells is prosurvival. This study also suggests that if TIGAR is targeted for
chemotherapy, inhibiting autophagy would provide additional beneﬁts.
