Abstract

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among men in industrialized
countries, accounting for the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. While we now know
that the androgen receptor (AR) is important for progression to the deadly advanced stages of the
disease, it is poorly understood what AR-regulated processes drive this pathology. Here, we
demonstrate that AR regulates prostate cancer cell growth via the metabolic sensor 5′-AMP-

activated protein kinase (AMPK), a kinase that classically regulates cellular energy homeostasis.
In patients, activation of AMPK correlated with prostate cancer progression. Using a combination
of radiolabeled assays and emerging metabolomic approaches, we also show that prostate cancer
cells respond to androgen treatment by increasing not only rates of glycolysis, as is commonly
seen in many cancers, but also glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, this effect was
dependent on androgen-mediated AMPK activity. Our results further indicate that the AMPKmediated metabolic changes increased intracellular ATP levels and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis,
affording distinct growth advantages to the prostate cancer cells. Correspondingly, we used outlier
analysis to determine that PGC-1α is overexpressed in a subpopulation of clinical cancer samples.
This was in contrast to what was observed in immortalized benign human prostate cells and a
testosterone-induced rat model of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Taken together, our findings
converge to demonstrate that androgens can co-opt the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling cascade, a
known homeostatic mechanism, to increase prostate cancer cell growth. The current study points
to the potential utility of developing metabolic-targeted therapies directed towards the AMPKPGC-1α signaling axis for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Since the 1920's, it has been known that cancer cells possess the unique ability to alter their
metabolism and, as such, are distinguishable from benign cells.1 However, it was only in the
past decade that the reprogramming of energy metabolism has been acknowledged as one of
the true emerging hallmarks of cancer.2 Interestingly, while the majority of metabolic cancer
research focuses on the role of glycolysis, it has recently become apparent that the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) also play major
roles in many types of cancers including prostate cancer.3-6 Both the genetic deletion or
pharmacological inhibition of key steps in the TCA cycle and/or OXPHOS can block cancer
cell growth in vitro and disease progression in vivo.7-10 Further, metabolic signatures of the
TCA cycle and OXPHOS correlate with cancer progression and unfavorable
outcomes.9,11-17 Also, 2-18F-fluoropropionic acid and 11C-acetate, new tracers being used
for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, are more sensitive detectors of prostate
cancer than the glycolysis marker 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.18-21 These data indicate that
prostate cancers can exhibit unique metabolic profiles. What is not understood is specifically
how androgen receptor (AR)-signaling, elevated in 100% of metastatic prostate cancers,22
impacts cellular metabolism and what role this plays in disease progression.
Prostate cancers express the AR and rely on androgens for growth and survival.23
Consequently, androgen ablation therapies are the standard of care for late-stage disease.
While patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond favorably to androgen
ablation therapy, most experience a relapse of the disease within 1-2 years. Following this

castration-resistant relapse, patients have limited treatment options. Although the hormonerefractory disease is unresponsive to androgen-deprivation, AR-regulated signaling
pathways remain active and are necessary for cancer progression.23,24 Thus, both AR itself
and the processes downstream of the receptor remain viable targets for therapeutic
intervention.

The master metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) governs overall
cellular homeostasis by modulating the use of sugars, fats and/or proteins as sources of
cellular fuel. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that androgens increase
cellular migration and invasion through the direct upregulation of Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) and subsequent threonine-172 (refers to
threonine-183/172 of the AMPKα 1/AMPKα2 isoforms, respectively) phosphorylation/
activation of the catalytic subunit of AMPK.25 Later, two more independent groups
confirmed our CaMKKβ findings in vitro and in multiple clinical cohorts and suggested
CaMKKβ also promotes glycolytic flux.26,27 Correspondingly, Park et al demonstrated that
levels of the serine-79 phosphorylated form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a direct
target of AMPK, are increased in clinical prostate cancer samples.28 Because of the
importance of androgen signaling in prostate cancer, and the increasing evidence from other
laboratories as well as our own that suggest AMPK may have an oncogenic role in certain
cancer contexts,25-31 we wanted to determine whether AR signaling promoted prostate
cancer cell growth in part through AMPK signaling. Further, given AMPK's role as a central
regulator of cellular metabolism, we also wanted to determine whether AR-mediated AMPK
signaling influenced prostate cancer cell biology through additional mechanisms beyond
those classically attributed to cancer (i.e. glycolysis).

AMPK is required for androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell growth

Author Manuscript

Our previous work identified a role for CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling in AR-mediated prostate
cancer cell migration and invasion.25 Subsequent studies confirmed AR's regulation of
CaMKKβ in prostate cancer and demonstrated its additional importance in regulating
prostate cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo.26,27 Additionally, Massie et al showed that
CaMKKβ augmented cell growth in part through increased glucose metabolism, an effect
they suggested may be mediated through AMPK.27 In that study, the role of AMPK was
inferred from experiments that used pharmacological AMP mimetics that, while known
activators of AMPK, cause cellular stress and therefore, may indirectly affect cell growth.
Because of these and other known pleiotropic effects of various AMPK modulators (ex.
compound C blocks AR activity25), we wanted to confirm a direct role for AMPK in ARmediated prostate cancer cell growth using molecular approaches. To do so, we blocked
AMPK activity using siRNAs targeting three separate regions of the predominant catalytic
subunit of AMPK found in the prostate.25 In both LNCaP and VCaP human prostate cancer
cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα1 decreased the levels of both total AMPKα
and the threonine-172/activation loop phosphorylated form of AMPKα, indicating blocked
AMPK activity (Figs. 1A and B). Importantly, all three siRNAs targeting AMPK
significantly inhibited R1881 (a synthetic androgen)-mediated prostate cancer cell growth in

Fig. S1).
Phosphorylated/Activated AMPK correlates with prostate cancer progression in patients

Author Manuscript

A tissue microarray (TMA) containing benign and primary cancer tissues was examined by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine if phospho-AMPK (Thr172), the activating
phosphorylation site, was increased in prostate cancer (Fig. 2). Staining of p-AMPK in the
TMA was quantified using a multiplicative staining index of intensity (0-3) and extent (0-3)
of staining, which yields a 10-point staining index (0-9) as described previously.32-34 In
benign tissues, weak staining (score 3) was observed in luminal cell cytoplasm in some
tissues, with other tissues showing no staining. Occasional tissues showed moderate staining
(score 6). In all cases, staining was uniform within each core. Variable cytoplasmic staining
was seen in the cancer cells in different tissues ranging from no staining to strong staining
(score 9). Overall, staining was significantly stronger in cancer (Fig. 2A). Occasional weak
staining was seen in stromal cells in both benign and cancer tissues. Of note, higher pAMPK staining was significantly correlated with biochemical (PSA) recurrence following
radical prostatectomy (non-recurrent 3.2 ± 0.4 (mean ± SEM, n=29) versus recurrent 4.6 ±
0.4 (n=32))(Fig. 2B). The p-AMPK IHC score was not correlated with pathological
variables such as Gleason score or disease stage at the time of surgery.
Androgens promote both glycolysis and OXPHOS

Author Manuscript

Given AMPK's role as a master regulator of metabolism and its regulation by AR in the
prostate, we next asked what effects androgens had on prostate cancer cell metabolism. To
quantitate glycolytic rates, we measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in
prostate cancer cells following treatment with R1881. In both LNCaP and VCaP cells,
R1881 increased glycolysis in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3A-C). Consistent with what
has previously been shown,35 the dose response was unaffected by various modulators of
mitochondrial function (Fig. 3C), highlighting the cytoplasmic nature of glycolysis.
Interestingly, simultaneous measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) indicated
that androgens also increased oxygen consumption in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3DF). This androgen-mediated increase in OCR was dependent on mitochondrial function as
combined treatment of rotenone and antimycin, inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration,
collapsed the response (Fig. 3F). The increased oxygen consumption indicated androgens
promote metabolism not only through glycolysis, but also through the TCA cycle. In support
of this, we used MS/MS to show that androgens increased intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA,
the entry molecule for the TCA cycle (Fig. 3G). Importantly, GC/MS was used to
demonstrate that androgens also increased the levels of all TCA cycle intermediates tested,
suggesting that acetyl-CoA is not only entering the TCA cycle, but also metabolized
completely through it (Fig. 3H). These data are in contrast to Massie et al who found that
androgen treatment increased citrate but not succinate levels nor oxygen consumption.27 To
verify whether complete oxidation was occurring, we used a radiolabeled CO2 trap assay to
demonstrate that androgens increase complete glucose oxidation (Fig. 3I; Supplemental Fig.
S2A). These results indicate that androgens promote the uptake and metabolism of
radiolabeled glucose through at least ∼1.5 turns of the TCA cycle prior to the radiolabeled
1-carbon of glucose being release in the form of CO2.

While the majority of metabolic cancer research focuses on the role of glucose, recently
several groups have demonstrated an important role for fatty acid metabolism in prostate
cancer.18,36-38 Correspondingly, in our hands, β-oxidation was required for maximal
androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell growth as co-treatment with etomoxir, an inhibitor
of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I—the rate-limiting step of β-oxidation, suppressed
androgen-mediated LNCaP growth (Fig. 3J). We therefore tested whether androgens could
also promote fatty acid oxidation in prostate cancer cells by tracking the metabolism of
radiolabeled fatty acids. Treatment of either LNCaP (Figs. 3K-L) or VCaP (Supplemental
Figs. S2B and C) cells with increasing concentrations of androgens promoted, in a dosedependent manner, the complete oxidation of both the saturated fatty acid palmitate and the
monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, two of the most common β-oxidation substrates.
Importantly, this correlates with previous clinical data demonstrating the increased
metabolism of both sugars and fats in aggressive metastatic prostate cancers compared to
localized tumors.39 Taken together, these findings indicate that androgens increase both
glycolysis (sugars) and OXPHOS (sugars and fats) in prostate cancer cells.
AMPK is required for androgen-mediated OXPHOS
AMPK is a positive regulator of OXPHOS. Given that AMPK is required for androgenmediated prostate cancer cell growth (Fig. 1), we next wanted to determine whether the
androgen-mediated increase in OXPHOS was mediated by AMPK. To do this, we used two
different approaches. First, we demonstrated in both LNCaP and VCaP cells that molecular
knockdown of AMPK decreased androgen-mediated oxygen consumption (Figs. 4A and B).
Second, knockdown of AMPK significantly inhibited the androgen-mediated oxidation of
radiolabeled glucose (Figs. 4C and D), palmitate (Figs. 4E and F) and oleate (Figs. 4G and
H).

One of the major functions of mitochondrial OXPHOS is to generate ATP. We therefore
wanted to determine whether the androgen-mediated OXPHOS indeed led to an increase in
intracellular ATP levels and hence, helped fulfill the cancer cell's bioenergetic demands.
Using a luciferase-based ATP assay, we determined that R1881 increased intracellular ATP
levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). This R1881-mediated increase in ATP levels
was blocked by transfection with the siRNAs targeting AMPK (Fig. 5B). These results
indicate that androgens increase mitochondrial function through AMPK.
Androgen-mediated AMPK signaling increases PGC-1α levels, which are elevated in a
subpopulation of prostate cancers

Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that androgens increase overall mitochondrial function. However, the
mechanism for this effect was still unknown. One of the known targets of AMPK is
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a
transcriptional coactivator that is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and
function.40 Therefore, we tested whether androgens could increase PGC-1α levels in
prostate cancer cells. Androgens, starting at 100 pM, significantly increased PGC-1α protein
levels in a dose-dependent manner in both LNCaP (Fig. 6A) and VCaP (Fig. 6B) prostate
cancer cells. Using qPCR, we found that increasing concentrations of R1881 could also
increase PGC-1α mRNA levels in LNCaP (Fig. 6C) and VCaP (Fig. 6D) cells after a 72

hour treatment. This induction was not seen following a 24-hour treatment (Supplemental
Fig. S3). Interestingly, despite the robust expression of AR, androgens did not significantly
alter PGC-1α levels in a stepwise genetic model of prostate cancer progression41
(Supplemental Fig. S4). This is not completely surprising given a) the heterogeneous nature
of prostate cancer and b) in culture, none of these cells display an androgen-mediated
growth response.41 However, using a hormone-inducible rat model of benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), we observed that while testosterone treatment increased prostate
growth,42,43 it did not increase PGC-1α protein levels (Supplemental Fig. S5). This is in
contrast to the increased PGC-1α levels observed in tumors derived from the dorsolateral
lobes of the well-characterized Pb-Cre, Ptenf/f mouse model of prostate cancer44
(Supplemental Fig. S6) or the Pb-Myc mouse model of prostate cancer45. Additionally,
comparison of parental LNCaP cells to their castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)derivative C4-2 cell line (derived from castration-resistant selection in xenografts)
demonstrates that p-AMPK and, accordingly, PGC-1α levels are markedly elevated in the
CRPC C4-2 model relative to parental LNCaPs (Fig. 6E). Xenograft-derived LAPC9 tumors
that were either propagated in intact mice or serially propagated for 13 generations in
castrated mice revealed that, despite decreased AR levels, PGC-1α levels are maintained
and surprisingly, total AMPK and, subsequently, p-AMPK levels are increased in the CRPC
model (Fig. 6E). While this is the first time we had observed changes in total AMPK levels,
it is important to note that AMPKα1/PRKAA1 (the predominant isoform of the catalytic
subunit of AMPK expressed in the prostate25) levels correlate with poor prognosis in
patients (Supplemental Fig. S7).22 These findings corroborate the clinical p-AMPK TMA
data shown in Figure 2. Taken together, our results suggest that AMPK-PGC-1α signaling
correlates with cancer growth and can be indirectly regulated by AR.

Author Manuscript

To test whether AMPK was responsible for the androgen-mediated increase in PGC-1α
levels, we used the same siRNAs targeting AMPK described in Figure 1 to determine what
effects they had on both basal and androgen-mediated PGC-1α levels (Figs. 6F and G;
Supplemental Fig. S8). In LNCaP and VCaP cells, knockdown of AMPK led to a significant
decrease in both PGC-1α protein (Fig. 6F; Supplemental Figs. S8A and B) and mRNA (Fig.
6G; Supplemental Fig. S8C) levels, demonstrating a clear requirement for AMPK in ARmediated induction of PGC-1α. Finally, stable knockdown of PGC-1α suppressed prostate
cancer cell growth/survival over three days roughly 40% in LNCaP cells (Supplemental Fig.
S8D) and, importantly, 50% in the CRPC C4-2 model (Fig. 6H), highlighting a potential
role for PGC-1α in the advanced disease.

Author Manuscript

Given that PGC-1α levels were increased in multiple models of prostate cancer, we next
determined if its expression correlated with prostate cancer in patients. Analysis of clinically
annotated prostate cancer data sets accessible through Oncomine revealed that PGC-1α
expression was significantly higher in cancers compared to controls (Supplemental Fig.
S9A).46 While this increase was significant, it was derived from a study with a modest
cohort size (19 patients). Because of the high degree of heterogeneity in prostate cancer, we
asked whether PGC-1α levels might be elevated in a subset of cancers. Using outlier
analysis, we found that PGC-1α was indeed overexpressed in a subpopulation of prostate
cancers in multiple clinical cohorts (Supplemental Fig. S9B).46-50 To better clinically define

this subset of patients, we took advantage of the emerging well-annotated datasets available
from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Here, PGC-1α is significantly overexpressed in ∼5% of
prostate cancer patients (no patients had significantly decreased expression). These patients
exhibited clinical pathologic T stages from T2c-T3b and Gleason scores from 7-9 with a
mean of 7.4. Interestingly, patients from this subpopulation are initially diagnosed with
prostate cancer significantly earlier (56.0 ± 1.5 years old versus 60.2 ± 0.5 years for the
average prostate cancer patient).
AR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and cell growth

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial function is essential for both basic cellular homeostasis as well as increased
cell growth.51 Given recent studies that suggest a previously underappreciated role for
mitochondrial function in cancer,3-17 we decided to test whether androgens could increase
mitochondrial biogenesis in prostate cancer cells. Using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), we found that LNCaP cells treated for 72 hours had significantly more mitochondria
(Fig. 7A). To test whether the AMPK-mediated induction of PGC-1α promoted androgenmediated mitochondrial biogenesis in a more unbiased manner, we used confocal
microscopy and subsequent image analysis to quantitatively assess if AMPK and/or PGC-1α
were required (Figs 7B-D; Supplemental Figs. S10 and 11). Using our two most efficacious
siRNAs targeting AMPK25 or PGC-1α (Supplemental Fig. S11), siRNA-mediated
knockdown of either AMPK or PGC-1α significantly decreased mitochondrial volume in
LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figs. 7B-D; Supplemental Figs. S10 and 11). Similar to knockdown
of AMPK (Figs. 1 and 4), molecular inhibition of PGC-1α also blocked androgen-mediated
OXPHOS (Fig. 7E) and, in concordance with what others have reported,52 prostate cancer
cell growth (Fig. 7F), an effect that was observed by three days (Supplemental Figs. S11C
and D). However, it should be noted that unlike what has previously been reported,52 in our
hands PGC-1α did not feedback to further potentiate AR activity (Supplemental Fig. S12).
Collectively, these results indicate a role for a more linear AR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling
cascade in prostate cancer cell growth.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

While much of the research on cancer metabolism has historically focused on glycolysis, it
is now becoming apparent that not all cancers depend solely on glycolytic metabolism.
Prostate cancer, in particular, appears to utilize other processes to fulfill its metabolic
demands. Accordingly, the glycolysis marker 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is a relatively poor
PET imaging marker for prostate cancer.18,19 Conversely, labeled fatty acid and acetate
analogs, which can be shuttled to fatty acid metabolism and/or enter the TCA cycle, have
shown more promising results.18,20,21 Interestingly, zinc and citrate levels are higher in
normal prostate epithelial cells than any other cell in the body. When prostate epithelial cells
become cancerous, they are uniquely characterized by decreased zinc and citrate levels,
which parallels with increased citrate oxidation and OXPHOS.5,6 Further, mitochondrial
biogenesis, TCA cycle and OXPHOS signatures correlate with unfavorable outcomes in
prostate cancer as well as other cancer types.3,11,13,15,16,53-56 Inhibition of mitochondrial
function/OXPHOS results in cell death or cell cycle arrest in multiple cancer types.8-10,17

Thus, while glycolysis is a major metabolic pathway in cancer, mitochondrion-mediated
functions still appear essential for many cancer cell types including prostate.

The findings above suggest that mitochondria could be an important target for various
oncogenic and tumor suppressor signaling cascades. Correspondingly, the telomerase
oncogene promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and prostate cancer bone metastasis while the
tumor suppressor p53 suppresses PGC-1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.13,54,55 Our
data presented here indicate that AR signaling also increases AMPK-PGC-1-mediated
mitochondrial biogenesis and prostate cancer cell growth (Fig. 7). This raises the question of
how mitochondrial biogenesis contributes to cell growth. One obvious possibility is that
rapidly dividing cells have high bioenergetic demands. By increasing the mitochondrial
content of the cell, androgens also increased the intracellular levels of ATP (Fig. 5).
Recently, however, it has been determined that the level of building blocks (ex. amino acids
for protein production, etc), rather than the level of ATP, may be the major rate-limiting
factor for rapidly dividing cells.4 As such, making sure a high level of TCA cycle
intermediates are maintained, a process termed anaplerosis, would be essential as the TCA
cycle serves as a central metabolic hub from which many of the cellular building blocks are
derived (Fig. 8). Our findings that androgens increase TCA cycle intermediate levels and
promote the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids through the TCA cycle (Fig. 3), suggest
that AR signaling is also anaplerotic. Current studies are ongoing to determine where
substrates are ultimately shuttled following androgen treatment.

The data presented here indicate that AMPK signaling is required for androgen-mediated
prostate cancer cell growth and is elevated in prostate cancer and, importantly, recurrent
prostate cancer (Figs. 1 and 2). To date, the role of AMPK in cancer has been enigmatic. We
(data not shown), and others,57 have demonstrated that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1β-D-ribo-furanoside (AICAR) and the antidiabetic drugs metformin and rosiglitazone, which
all activate AMPK, also inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Conversely, while Massie et al
also found that metformin inhibited LNCaP cell growth, they showed AICAR increased
LNCaP cell growth in the presence or absence of androgens. Additionally, AICAR was able
to rescue the growth inhibitory effects of either CaMKKβ RNAi knockdown or STO-609
(CaMKK antagonist) treatment.27 Further, AMPK has been shown to be activated in clinical
prostate cancer samples and inhibition of its activity by compound C or siRNAs targeting
AMPK blocks cancer cell growth (Figs. 1 and 2).28 These discrepancies may be due to the
pleiotropic effects of the various small molecules being used to modulate AMPK activity.
For example, AICAR functions by inducing cellular stress. One of the results of this
increased cellular stress is the activation of AMPK. However, the widespread increase in
cellular stress may undoubtedly function to inhibit cellular growth through other stress
signaling pathways. Alternatively, the pro-growth effects of AMPK may, similar to many
signaling cascades, occur within a defined window of activity where some controlled AMPK
activity promotes a metabolic shift that enhances cell growth but too much AMPK activity
signals stress and subsequent cell cycle arrest.
In prostate cancer cells, androgens increase PGC-1α protein and mRNA levels (Figs. 6A-D).
While we know AMPK is required for this PGC-1α regulation (Figs. 6F and G;
Supplementary Fig. S8), we still do not understand the exact mechanism. Previously, Bruce

Spiegelman's laboratory demonstrated that AMPK increases both PGC-1α protein and
mRNA levels in skeletal muscle.40 In that study, they found that AMPK directly
phosphorylates PGC-1α on threonine-177 and serine-538. These phosphorylation events
then increase the activity of PGC-1α protein on its own promoter, increasing its expression
through a mechanism that may involve the transcription factors GATA-4 and Upstream
Stimulatory Factor-1.58 Hence, the AR-AMPK mediated increase in PGC-1α protein and
mRNA levels may occur through the direct posttranslational phosphorylation of PGC-1α
protein by AMPK and subsequent positive feedback expression of the PPARGC1A gene.

Our data correlate with recent findings that indicate PGC-1α signaling is upregulated in
endometrial cancer,12 drives breast cancer tumor growth in vivo,59 and Pgc1α-/- mice are
resistant to chemically-induced models of colon and liver cancer.7 Correspondingly, Shiota
et al also demonstrated that PGC-1α was essential for prostate cancer cell growth.52
Interestingly, in that study, PGC-1α was shown to function as a coactivator of AR. In our
hands, we did not observe this effect (Supplemental Fig. S12). Thus, our current data
indicate AR, via AMPK, increases PGC-1α levels in a more linear manner (Fig. 8). Whether
AMPK and PGC-1α promote cancer cell growth through additional mechanisms remains to
be determined. Hence, while AMPK-PGC-1α signaling promotes prostate cancer cell
growth in part through increasing mitochondrial function (known because inhibition of
mitochondrial function decreases cell growth/survival (Fig. 3J)10), AMPK-PGC-1α
signaling may also enhance prostate cancer cell growth through additional, mitochondrionindependent mechanisms (ex. increasing cyclin D levels, etc). This could also help explain
why knockdown of PGC-1α had a more dramatic effect on cell growth (Fig. 7F;
Supplemental Figs. S11C and D) than it did on mitochondrial biogenesis (Figs. 7B-D;
Supplemental Figs. S10 and 11). The more modest effects on mitochondrial biogenesis were
likely due to the suboptimal efficacy of our PGC-1α -targeting siRNAs (Supplemental Fig.
S11). Conversely, the dramatic effect of molecular PGC-1α inhibition on growth suggests
that PGC-1α may potentiate androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell growth through
additional mechanisms. As a result, the modest inhibition of a single protein, PGC-1α,
would result in pronounced overall growth effects.

Author Manuscript

Collectively, the data presented here suggest that AR signaling promotes AMPK-PGC-1α mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and cell growth. This is important because while AR's
role in prostate cancer has been well established, the mechanisms by which AR manifests its
biological actions and how these are dysregulated during disease progression are poorly
understood. As a result, it is essential to identify the AR signaling networks that truly drive
disease progression. Our understanding of these signaling pathways will ultimately yield
new therapeutic targets. Hence, as our data indicate, modulators of mitochondrial function
may offer new therapeutic avenues for AR-driven prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer TMAs were constructed using tissues collected after radical prostatectomy
with informed consent by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Tissue Acquisition and
Pathology Core under an IRB-approved protocol. The arrays were 1 mm cores of 80 cancers
and matched benign tissues with equal numbers of cases with and without biochemical
recurrence. Arrays stained with anti-phospho-AMPK antibody were carried out as described
in the Supplementary Material and quantitated using a multiplicative staining index of
intensity (0-3) and extent (0-3) of staining yielding a 10-point staining index (0-9) as
described in previous publications.32-34 Some cancer cores could not be scored due to
exhaustion of tumor in the core and likewise in some cores no benign epithelium was
present. Overall 61 cancers and 65 benign tissues could be scored. Scoring was performed
without knowledge of the corresponding clinical and pathological variables.
Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements

Author Manuscript

ECAR, reflective of the rate of glycolysis, and OCR, reflective of the rate of OXPHOS,
were measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 analyzer (North Billerica, MA, USA).
Cells were plated at 30,000 cells/well in Seahorse XF24 plates coated with BD Cell-Tak
(BD Biosciences) and incubated for 48 hours. For R1881 dose response experiments, the
cells were then treated for 72 hours. For knockdown experiments, cells were transfected
with indicated siRNAs overnight prior to treatment. For ECAR and OCR measurements in
the presence of inhibitors (oligomycin-1.3 μM; Carbonyl cyanide 4(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP)-1 μM; rotenone-1 μM; antimycin A-1 μM), the
samples were treated with R1881 and then incubated for 72 hours. During the initial/basal
phase of assaying no inhibitors were present. Thereafter at respective time points inhibitorcontaining media were sequentially injected to the assay wells through automated instrument
ports. Data were normalized to cell numbers using the DNA content assay described in the
Supplementary Information.
Metabolic profiling
Measurements of intracellular acetylcarnitine levels, which are reflective of acetyl-CoA
levels, and organic acid/TCA cycle intermediates were performed using tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as previously
described.60

described.42,43 All animals remained healthy throughout the experiments. Animal care was
in accordance with institutional guidelines and complied with NIH policy.
Statistical analysis
Two-sample comparisons were performed using Student's t-tests. Multiple comparisons
were performed using a one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's test with GraphPad
Prism, Version 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). TMA staining intensity groups
were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using a
log-rank test. Significant changes were determined at the P < 0.05 level unless otherwise
noted.

Androgens promote glycolysis and OXPHOS in prostate cancer cells. A and B, LNCaP (A)
or VCaP (B) cells were treated for 72 hours with increasing concentrations of R1881 (0,
0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 nM). Extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) were then measured
using a Seahorse XF Analyzer and values were normalized to cell numbers. Results are
expressed as ECAR normalized to cell numbers + SE (n = 3). C, LNCaP cells were treated
and analyzed for ECAR as in A but were also tested for effects on ECAR in the sequential
presence of oligomycin, FCCP and a combination of rotenone and antimycin A. D and E,
LNCaP (D) and VCaP (E) cells were treated the same as in A and B. At the same time
ECAR rates were being measured, simultaneous oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were
measured and normalized the same as in A and B. F, LNCaP cells were treated and analyzed
for OCR as in D but were also tested for effects on OCR in the sequential presence of
oligomycin, FCCP and a combination of rotenone and antimycin A. G, LNCaP cells were
treated for 72 hours with increasing doses of R1881 (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 nM). Acetyl-CoA
levels were then measured using MS/MS and normalized to total protein. Results are
expressed as acetyl-CoA levels normalized to total protein + SE (n = 3). H, LNCaP cells
were treated as in G. TCA cycle intermediate levels were then measured using GC/MS and
normalized to total protein. Results are expressed as metabolite levels normalized to total
protein + SE (n = 2). I, LNCaP cells were treated as in A and then incubated with 14Clabeled glucose and subjected to a CO2 trap assay to measure complete glucose oxidation
and normalized to cell numbers. Results are expressed as fold counts per minute (CPM)
normalized to cell numbers + SE (n = 3). J, LNCaP cells were cotreated for 7 days with
increasing doses of R1881 in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or the β-oxidation inhibitor

normalized to cell numbers + SE (n = 3). B, cells were transfected and treated as in Fig. 1A.
ATP levels were then quantitated and normalized as in A. *, significant changes from
vehicle-treated cells.

AR-AMPK signaling increases PGC-1α levels. A-D, prostate cancer cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of R1881 for 72 hours. A left, representative LNCaP Western
blots following treatment (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM R1881). A right, LNCaP immunoblot
densitometry values. PGC-1α levels were normalized to GAPDH (n = 4). B left,
representative VCaP Western blots following treatment (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM R1881).
B right, VCaP immunoblot densitometry values. PGC-1α levels were normalized to
GAPDH (n = 4). C and D, LNCaP (C) and VCaP (D) cells treated for 72 hours with 0, 0.01,
0.1, 1 or 10 nM R1881. After treatment, cells were lysed and RNA was isolated and reverse
transcribed. The expression of PGC-1α was assessed using qPCR (n = 3). E, cell/tumor
lysates from untreated parental LNCaP and CRPC-derivative C4-2 cells or LAPC9-derived
androgen-dependent (LAPC9-AD) and CRPC (LAPC9-AI) tumor xenografts were subjected
to Western blot analysis. F and G, LNCaP cells were transfected and treated as described in
Fig. 1A. Cells were then subjected to immunoblot (F) or qPCR (G) analysis (n = 3).
Densitometry values for F are presented in Supplementary Fig. S8B. *, significant changes
from vehicle-treated cells. H, C4-2 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting either scramble
control (shControl) or PGC-1α (shPGC-1α) were subjected to a 3-day cell growth/viability
assay. Inset, Western blot control demonstrating PGC-1α stable knockdown. *, significant
change from shControl cells.

AR-AMPK signaling increases PGC-1α -mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, OXPHOS and
cell growth. A, LNCaP cells were treated ± 10 nM R1881 for 72 hours and then subjected to
TEM analysis. Shown are representative images (left) and results from blinded scoring of
mitochondrial numbers/section (right). B-D, VCaP (Figs. 7B and C) and LNCaP (Fig. 7D
and Supplementary Fig. S10) cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs and treated as in
Figs. 1A and B. Mitochondrial volume was then assessed using fluorescence confocal
microscopy and subsequent image analysis. Shown are representative images (Fig. 7B and
Supplementary Fig. S10) and quantitated morphometric analysis (Figs. 7C and D). Scale
bar, 10 μm. E, LNCaP cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs and treated as described
in D. Oxidation of radiolabeled glucose was then measured using a CO2 trap assay and
normalized to cell numbers as in Fig. 4. *, significant changes from vehicle-treated cells. F,
LNCaP cells were transfected as in E and then treated for 7 days ± R1881. Relative cell
numbers were determined using the assay described in Fig. 1. *, significant changes from
vehicle-treated cells.

Proposed model of the AR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling axis. Androgens, through AR,
increase AMPK activity. AMPK then potentiates PGC-1α. Increased PGC-1α can then
promote mitochondria biogenesis and function.
