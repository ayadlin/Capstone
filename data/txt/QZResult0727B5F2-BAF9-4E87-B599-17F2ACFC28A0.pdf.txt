ABSTRACT
Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is among the most fatal of all pediatric
brain tumors. Aside from loss of function mutations in the SMARCB1 (BAF47/INI1/
SNF5) chromatin remodeling gene, little is known of other molecular drivers of AT/
RT. LIN28A and LIN28B are stem cell factors that regulate thousands of RNAs and
are expressed in aggressive cancers. We identified high-levels of LIN28A and LIN28B
in AT/RT primary tumors and cell lines, with corresponding low levels of the LIN28regulated microRNAs of the let-7 family. Knockdown of LIN28A by lentiviral shRNA
in the AT/RT cell lines CHLA-06-ATRT and BT37 inhibited growth, cell proliferation
and colony formation and induced apoptosis. Suppression of LIN28A in orthotopic
xenograft models led to a more than doubling of median survival compared to empty
vector controls (48 vs 115 days). LIN28A knockdown led to increased expression of
let-7b and let-7g microRNAs and a down-regulation of KRAS mRNA. AT/RT primary
tumors expressed increased mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway activity,
and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) decreased AT/RT growth and increased
apoptosis. These data implicate LIN28/RAS/MAP kinase as key drivers of AT/RT
tumorigenesis and indicate that targeting this pathway may be a therapeutic option
in this aggressive pediatric malignancy.

[2]. Due to its aggressive nature and resistance to existing
treatment, there is a significant need for novel therapeutic
targets in AT/RT.
Deletions and mutations of the SMARCB1 (BAF47/
INI1/SNF5) gene are the hallmark of AT/RT tumors, yet
there are no other recurrent genetic abnormalities [3-5].
SMARCB1 is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex, and loss of function of SMARCB1
can dysregulate thousands of genes across the genome
[6]. While mutations at this locus are the defining genetic
alteration of AT/RT, much of the biology contributing to
the development and aggressiveness of AT/RT is poorly
understood [7].
Another distinguishing characteristic of AT/RT is a
heterogeneous histologic appearance with characteristics
of several distinct cell lineages, suggesting that stem cells
may play a role in the tumorigenesis of AT/RT [1]. Primary
AT/RT tumors express stem cell factors such as SAL4,
KLF4, and MUSHASHI [8]. LIN28A is a stem cell factor
that was first discovered as a regulator of development, and
it has since been implicated in multiple aggressive cancers
[9]. LIN28A expression is high in embryonic stem cells
and maintains pluripotency by inhibiting let-7 induced
differentiation [10]. The let-7 family of microRNAs
in turn acts as tumor suppressors, through inhibition of
oncogenes including KRAS, HMGA2, and MYC. We have
previously identified LIN28A as a driver of proliferation
and invasion in adult and pediatric glioblastoma [11]. As
part of a screen of a series of pediatric brain tumors for
LIN28A expression, we identified high level LIN28A
expression in AT/RT samples by immunohistochemistry.
We hypothesized that LIN28A and LIN28B might
contribute to AT/RT tumorigenicity by upregulating at
the RNA level many oncogenic proteins which contribute
to AT/RT growth, invasion, and metabolism. We report
that LIN28A and LIN28B are highly expressed in AT/
RT primary tumors and cell lines, and that knockdown of
LIN28A suppresses AT/RT growth and tumorigenicity and
leads to downregulation of KRAS mRNA. Examination of
AT/RT primary tumor tissue shows expression of the RAS
effector phospho-ERK in 77% of AT/RT. We demonstrate
that the MEK inhibitor selumetinib also suppresses AT/
RT cell line growth and induces apoptosis, phenocopying
LIN28A loss. These results indicate activation of a LIN28/
RAS/MAP kinase pathway in AT/RT and suggest that
MEK inhibitors may be effective in this tumor.

of pediatric and adult glioblastoma [11]. LIN28B is
expressed in a poor-prognosis subset of medulloblastoma,
[12] and a subtype of primitive neuroectodermal tumors
has increased expression of LIN28A [13, 14]. By
immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that 19/24 AT/
RT were positive for LIN28A (79%). Approximately 30%
of AT/RT have moderate or high-level LIN28A staining
(Figure 1A). Normal cortex did not show any LIN28A
expression by IHC (Supplemental Figure 1A). We were
not able to interrogate AT/RT at the level of histology for
LIN28B, due to a lack of LIN28B antibodies validated
for IHC. We next investigated the mRNA expression of
LIN28A and LIN28B in AT/RT tumors by qPCR, using
pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) as a comparator.
These tumor types have not been systematically
interrogated for LIN28 expression and have relatively few
genomic alterations. We found that primary AT/RT tumors
expressed high level LIN28A and LIN28B mRNA (Figure
1B, p=0.002 for LIN28A and p=0.006 for LIN28B by
Mann-Whitney test) compared to PA tumors. Of the 23 AT/
RT tumors that were evaluated by qPCR for both LIN28A
and LIN28B expression, 6 tumors had predominantly high
LIN28A expression, 5 tumors had predominantly high
LIN28B expression, 7 tumors had equivalent high-level
expression of both LIN28A and LIN28B, and 5 tumors had
low-level expression of LIN28A and LIN28B, comparable
to levels found in PA. In total, 18/23 AT/RT (78%) showed
increased expression of LIN28A, LIN28B or both.
LIN28A is known to negatively regulate the tumorsuppressing microRNAs of the let-7 family, and when we
performed Nanostring assay for let-7 family members,
we found that AT/RT tumors had significantly lower let-7
levels than PA samples (Figure 1C, p<0.01 for all let-7
species by Mann-Whitney test).
When we examined medulloblastoma primary
tumors for comparison of LIN28A expression, we
found that 24 percent of these aggressive pediatric brain
malignancies (15/63 tumors) expressed increased levels of
LIN28A by IHC compared to normal brain (Supplemental
Figure 1A). By qPCR we found increased LIN28B
expression in 16/31 (52%) of medulloblastoma samples,
compared to normal pediatric cerebellum (Supplemental
Figure 1B). This is consistent with previous reports of
increased LIN28B expression in medulloblastoma [12].

and LIN28B

RESULTS

We found that of the 6 AT/RT cell lines in our
laboratory, 2 expressed LIN28A at high level by western
blot, and 3 expressed LIN28B at high level (Figure 2A).
By qPCR, we detected LIN28A in CHLA-02, indicating
that in this panel, 100% of AT/RT express LIN28A or
LIN28B (data not shown).

Compared to pLKO empty vector, in BT37 we detected a
50% reduction in growth at day 8 (Figure 2C, p=0.003 for
sh800 vs pLKO control and p=0.004 for sh803 vs pLKO,
by Student’s t-test). Similarly, in CHLA-06 we detected
a 60% inhibition in growth with LIN28A knockdown by
MTS assay (Figure 2C, p=0.0004 for sh802 vs pLKO
control and p=0.009 for sh803 vs pLKO, by Student’s

cells, we observed a 65% reduction in the percentage of
proliferating cells after LIN28A knockdown, as measured
by BrdU incorporation, compared to pLKO empty vector

To examine the importance of LIN28A in the
tumorigenicity of AT/RT, we used short hairpin RNA
constructs packaged in lentivirus to inhibit LIN28A
protein expression. Effective LIN28A knockdown by two
distinct shRNA constructs was confirmed by western blot
(Figure 2B) in two cell lines derived from primary human
AT/RT tumors (BT37 and CHLA-06).
Knockdown of LIN28A resulted in a significant

by injecting shLIN28A-transduced or pLKO control

appearance of the tumors that formed in either group, and
we determined by LIN28A immunohistochemistry that
LIN28A knockdown tumors expressed LIN28A at a level
equal to that found in pLKO tumors (data not shown).

expressing cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) compared to controls,
as measured by immunofluorescence (Figure 4A – For

in the expression of cleaved PARP (cPARP) protein in
CHLA-06 and BT37 cells with LIN28A knockdown

further assessed with cell cycle analysis, and we observed
an increase in the sub-G1 population in both BT37 and

(Supplemental Figure 2).

4C). We assessed the effect of LIN28A knockdown on
potential targets of the let-7 miRNAs by qPCR. Although
we did not detect a decrease in the expression of MYC,
HMGA2 or IGF2 (data not shown), we did observe a
reduction in the expression of KRAS mRNA in BT37 and
CHLA-06 cells with LIN28A knockdown (Figure 4D).
Suppression of LIN28A expression led to decreased levels

We next interrogated the effect of LIN28A

AT/RT primary tumors show high level phosphoERK activation

There was a positive correlation between pERK and
LIN28A expression (R=0.57, p=0.009 by Spearman
correlation).

We hypothesized that the RAS pathway may
be important for AT/RT growth. We determined by
immunohistochemistry on 22 primary human AT/RT
tumors that 86% of AT/RT expressed phospho-ERK, a key
readout of MAP kinase pathway activation (Figure 5A).
While some tumors had diffuse high-level staining for
phospho-ERK, others had more patchy immunoreactivity.
Of those showing activated ERK, 37% (7 out of 19
tumors) showed intermediate or high level expression.

Targeting the MAP kinase pathway suppresses
AT/RT growth and induces apoptosis
We disrupted the RAS/MAP kinase pathway using
selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor in phase I and II clinical
trials in children with brain tumors (NCT01089101).
Selumetinib efficiently blocked ERK activation in AT/RT
cell lines (Figure 5B) using standard doses [15]. Treatment

BT37 and CHLA-06 (Figure 5C, for BT37 p=0.003 for
1 uM and p=0.001 for 10 uM vs DMSO control; for
CHLA-06 p=0.009 for 1 uM and 10uM vs DMSO control
by t-test). We obtained similar results using the LIN28Bexpressing BT12 AT/RT cell line (p=0.00009 for 10 uM vs
DMSO control by t-test) (Supplemental Figure 4).
We observed a 50 percent or greater decrease in
proliferation, as measured by BrdU incorporation, after
4 days of treatment with selumetinib in both BT37 and
CHLA-06 cells (Figure 5D – for BT37 p=0.008 for
1uM and p=0.004 for 10 uM vs DMSO; for CHLA-06

apoptosis in both AT/RT cell lines, as measured by CC3

further assessed with cell cycle analysis, and we observed

functional significance of the LIN28 pathway in AT/
RT and indicate that LIN28 is important for the overall
growth, proliferation, clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of
this aggressive tumor.
In orthotopic xenograft experiments, we found that
the BT37 tumors that formed after LIN28A knockdown
had morphological characteristics and LIN28A expression
that was indistinguishable from pLKO-transduced
cells. The increased latency of tumor formation that we
identified after LIN28A knockdown was likely due to the
vast majority of LIN28A knockdown cells being unable to
grow. The tumors that did form were likely derived from a
small population of BT37 cells that escaped from LIN28A
knockdown. The universal expression of LIN28A in the
BT37 pLKO and LIN28A knockdown tumors further
supports the importance of LIN28 in AT/RT.
On a mechanistic level, LIN28A is known to
regulate the let-7 family of microRNAs [21, 22].
Downregulation of let-7 has also been linked to human
malignancies [23-27]. In our LIN28A knockdown
experiments, we found LIN28A levels to be inversely
correlated with let-7b and let-7g microRNA expression.
We also found downregulation of KRAS mRNA and
phospho-ERK signaling after LIN28A suppression.
Identification of the RAS pathway as highly active in AT/
RT, and that MEK inhibition suppresses the growth of AT/
RT cells and induces apoptosis is consistent with recent
findings of dysregulation of cyclin dependent kinases
(CDKs) in AT/RT and an increasingly recognized role
of LIN28 in regulating CDKs [28]. The frequent lack of
expression of p16INK4a in AT/RT [29] is also consistent with
an ability to tolerate high-level MAP kinase signaling and
avoid oncogene induced senescence [30].
The broad expression of p-ERK suggests that MEK
may be a therapeutic target in AT/RT. We found equal
responses to the MEK-inhibitor selumetinib in BT37
and CHLA06 (LIN28A-expressing) and BT12 (LIN28Bexpressing) cell lines, indicating that both LIN28A and
LIN28B-expressing AT/RT may be sensitive to this class
of pharmaceutical. Selumetinib is currently in phase I/II
clinical trials in pediatric patients with low grade gliomas
(NCT01089101). Additional, more potent, MEK inhibitors
with improved brain penetration are also being tested in
early phase trials in children (NCT02124772).
In AT/RT there is a significant absence of mutations
in canonical pathways normally implicated in aggressive
cancer [4]. However, both SMARCB1 and LIN28A/B
regulate large portions of the genome through chromatin
remodeling and RNA stabilization respectively [31,
32]. A recent study reported that LIN28 regulates more
than 3,000 different RNA species, many of which are
implicated in oncogenic pathways [33]. LIN28A and
SMARCB1 can suppress senescence by regulating cell
proliferation and growth pathways [6]. LIN28 is also able
to adjust the metabolism of cells, promoting tumor growth
and survival [34-36]. AT/RT is known to express multiple

DISCUSSION
A greater understanding of molecular abnormalities
contributing to the development of AT/RT is essential
to the improvement of therapeutic options. However,
multiple genome-wide analyses have yielded no reports
of consistent genetic aberrations in addition to mutations
in the SMARCB1 gene [3, 4]. Our study investigated the
molecular biology underlying the tumorigenicity of AT/
RT.
We found frequent overexpression of the cellreprogramming factors LIN28A and LIN28B in AT/RT
primary tumor samples and cell lines. In total, 18/23
(78%) of AT/RT tumors showed increased expression of
LIN28A and/or LIN28B by qPCR.Our data together with
recent reports of increased HMGA2 expression in AT/RT
suggest a broad reliance on the LIN28/HMGA2 pathway
in this tumor [16].
Increased expression of LIN28 and HMGA2
are consistent with reports of the role of this pathway
in other aggressive tumors [9]. In brain tumors, we
recently reported that LIN28A promotes invasion and
tumorigenesis in glioblastoma in part through upregulation
of HMGA2 [11]. LIN28B expression is a poor prognostic
factor in medulloblastoma [12], LIN28A is associated with
worse prognosis in primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor [13,
14], and LIN28A and LIN28B are known to be expressed
in germ cell tumors [17]. Our finding of high-level
LIN28A expression in 30 percent of AT/RT is consistent
with results of other groups who have performed IHC on
AT/RT for LIN28A [18-20]. The experiments described
here are the first to our knowledge to investigate the

stem cell markers, and may arise from stem cells [8, 20].
Persistent expression of LIN28 and other stem cell factors
may be due to the cell of origin of AT/RT. SMARCB1 loss
may lead to a block of differentiation and persistence of
a stem-like state. The ability of LIN28 and SMARCB1
to simultaneously regulate large sections of the genome
and suppress senescence could spark the development of
a malignant tumor such as AT/RT.
In summary, our study demonstrates the importance
of the LIN28/let-7 pathway in AT/RT. Knockdown of
LIN28A using short hairpin RNA constructs resulted in
a significant decrease in cell growth, proliferation, and
clonogenic potential, as well as a corresponding induction
of apoptosis. In orthotopic xenograft experiments, loss of
LIN28A was sufficient to increase the latency of AT/RT
tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. Investigation
of LIN28A/let-7 targets in AT/RT demonstrated
downregulation of KRAS after LIN28A knockdown, and
we demonstrated the upregulation of KRAS downstream
effectors by identifying phospho-ERK signaling in
primary AT/RT. Inhibition of MEK by selumetinib in AT/
RT led to growth suppression and induction of apoptosis,
indicating that this pathway may be a promising target
for therapeutic intervention in this currently highly lethal
tumor.

ug/ml puromycin. All experiments were performed within
14 days of infection of cells.

Immunofluorescence assays
For immunofluorescence assays, cells were cytospun
onto positively charged slides (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA), washed once with PBS, and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. After washing three
times with PBST, cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton/PBS, blocked for 15 minutes with 5% normal goat
serum/PBST, and then incubated with the cleaved caspase
3 primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA). Cells were then washed three times with PBST
and incubated for 45 minutes in the dark with the Cy-3
conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch,
West Grove, PA). Following this incubation, cells were
counterstained with DAPI and mounted with anti-fade
mounting media (Vectastain, Burlingame, CA).

METHODS
Cell Culture
The AT/RT cell lines CHLA-02-ATRT, CHLA04-ATRT, and CHLA-06-ATRT have been previously
described [37]. CHLA-02-ATRT and CHLA-04-ATRT are
available from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The BT37 AT/RT
cell line was derived from a serially passaged xenograft
derived from a patient with AT/RT. Cells were grown as
semi-adherent cultures in RPMI/10% FBS media (500
mL RPMI, 50 mL fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine,
1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY). Cells were split at high density after scraping
and gentle titration. BT12 cells (available through the
Children’s Oncology Group cell repository, Lubbock, TX)
were grown in RPMI/10% FBS media (500 mL RPMI, 50
mL fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin/
Streptomycin. Selumetinib (AZD6244) was obtained
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX) and dissolved in
DMSO.

Flow cytometry
Cells were fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol and
processed according to the Guava cell cycle flow
cytometry protocol (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Data
were captured on a Guava flow cytometer.

Growth Assays
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays were
performed by incubating cells with 100 uM 5-bromo-2’deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 hours. Cells
were taken out of the BrdU medium, dissociated into
single cells with gentle titration and Accutase, washed with
PBS, and fixed with methanol overnight at 4 C. Cells were
cytospun onto positively charged slides and processed as
described above. Anti-BrdU antibody was used as per
the manufacturer’s direction (Sigma-Aldrich, B2531) at
1:500 dilution and visualized as described above. Results
were analyzed in Adobe Photoshop, where BrdU-positive
cells were counted using the count tool. To assess relative
growth, cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate at

Viral infections and short hairpin constructs
Lentivirus vectors encoding short hairpin RNA
constructs against LIN28A were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) (TRCN0000021800,
TRCN0000021802 and TRCN00000803). To produce the

densities of 4000 cells per well. Relative cell number was
then measured at 0, 2, 4, and 7 days using the colorimetric
CellTiter 96 MTS assay (Promega).

Six-well plates were coated with a bottom agar/
media mixture, which was made from a 1:1 mixture of
a prepared 2x concentration of neurosphere media and
1 percent melted agarose (Life Technologies) in water.
Cells were incubated in Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich),
triturated into single cells, and placed into a top agarose/
media mixture (0.7%) an immediately plated into the
6-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 1.5
mL of agarose. 1.5 ml of media was then placed into
each well. Fresh media was added every 7 days, and the
colonies were grown for 1.5 to 2 weeks. Colonies were
then visualized by staining with nitroblue tetrazolium
(Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37 C and quantified using
MCID Elite software (Cambridge, England, UK) with a
gate diameter of 50 microns.

For animal care and anesthesia, “Principles of
laboratory animal care” (NIH publication No. 86-23,
revised 1985) were followed, using a protocol approved
by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee,
in compliance with the United States Animal Welfare Act
regulations and Public Health Service Policy. Intracranial
xenografts were produced in anesthetized animals as
previously described [11]. Injection guide holes were
produced by an 18-gauge beveled needle and 1x105 viable
cells were injected in 5 ul of growth medium into the right
striatum stereotactically through a needle connected to a
Hamilton syringe. Cells were injected using the following
coordinates: antero-posterior = -3mm; medio-latral=2
mm; dorso-ventral =3 mm. Animals were sacrificed
upon signs of distress suggestive of an intracranial mass
lesion such as neurologic deficits, poor grooming, and
cachexia. Xenograft tumors were embedded in paraffin
and processed for immunohistochemistry by the Johns
Hopkins Histopathology Core.

Quantitative RT-PCR

Statistical Analysis

Relative RNA expression was analyzed by realtime PCR analysis in triplicate with SYBER Green
reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) per
manufacturer’s instructions on an I-Cycler IQ5 realtime detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Expression levels were determined using the delta/delta
CT method and then normalized to either β-ACTIN
or 18S rRNA. Primer sequences were as follows:
human LIN28A forward: CGGGCATCTGTAAGT,
reverse: CAGACCCTTGGCTGA; human β-ACTIN
forward: CCCAGCACAATGAAGATCAA, reverse:
GATCCACACGGAGTACTTG;
human
18S
forward: GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT, reverse:
CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG;
human
KRAS
forward: GGGGAGGGCTTTCTTTGTGT, reverse:
GTCCTGAGCCTGTTTTGTGTC. Relative expression
of microRNAs, mature let-7a, b, and g were quantified
using Taqman MicroRNA Assay (Life Technologies) per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression levels were
normalized to 18S rRNA.

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) or
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). All tests were two sided
unless indicated otherwise, and p values under 0.05 were
considered significant unless otherwise indicated. Error
bars on graphs are SEM unless otherwise indicated.

Colony formation assay in soft agarose

Primary brain tumor samples
Brain tumor specimens were procured by the
departments of pathology at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine Department of Pathology, the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital with institutional review
board approval. All samples were de-identified.

Immunohistochemistry
Phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)
was used as described previously [38]. Anti-LIN28A (Cell
Signaling Technology) was used as described previously
[16]. AT/RT tissue cores were scored by a neuropathologist
(CGE) using H-scores (H) (0–200) which were obtained
by multiplying the intensity of stain (0: no stain, 1: weak
stain, 2: strong stain) by percentage (0–100) of neoplastic
cells showing the staining intensity. Tumors were scored
for phospho-ERK and LIN28A as being negative (score
of 0), low (5 to 45), intermediate (50-95) or high (100 and
above).

Western blotting
Western blots were performed as previously
described [11]. Specific antibodies were used as per the
manufacturer’s instructions: LIN28A (Cell Signaling
Technologies), β-ACTIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
Dallas, TX), GAPDH; Fitzgerald Industries, Acton, MA).

LIN28 and let-7 RNA quantification

Scherr for assistance with experiments. This paper is
dedicated to his memory.

Total RNA was extracted from frozen brain tumors
using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity
and quality of the RNA was determined using a Nanodrop
1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the
relative expression of LIN28A and LIN28B in both
primary AT/RT and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) brain
tumor samples. Expression levels were determined using
the delta/delta Ct method on the ABI 7500 FAST realtime detection system with the Taqman assays, LIN28A
– Hs00702808_s1 and LIN28B – hs01013729_m1, as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines (Applied Biosystems). All
samples were run in triplicate and GAPDH was used as the
endogenous control for the normalization.
A total of 45 RNA samples, 26 AT/RT and 18 PA,
were submitted to Nanostring for microRNA expression
analysis using the microRNA nCounter assay (version
1), which measured the expression level of 654 human
microRNAs (Nanostring, Seattle, WA).
The raw Nanostring data were analyzed using the
methods described in the nCounter Expression Data
Analysis Guide (http://www.nanostring.com/media/pdf/
MAN_nCounter_Gene_Expression_Data_Analysis_
Guidelines.pdf). In the first round of analysis, the
technical reproducibility of the assay was assessed, and
one lane from each set of technical replicates was chosen
to represent the tumor in the second round of analysis.
The steps for the two rounds of analysis consisted of
(i) calculating the average value of all negative probes
across all tumor samples; (ii) calculating the geometric
mean for each sample from the overall top 100 expressing
microRNAs; (iii) performing a lane normalization using
the normalization factor determined by the average
geometric mean for the entire assay; (iv) determining the
negative threshold for the assay by calculating the mean
+2 standard deviation of the negative control probes for
each lane and then averaging these values across the assay.
The Pearson correlation was used at the end of
the first round of analysis to determine the technical
reproducibility of the assay. A correlation value above
0.95 was considered highly correlated. A random
number generator was then used to select the lane that
was representative of each tumor in the second round of
analysis. The microRNA counts determined at the end of
the two rounds of analysis were then used for downstream
statistical analyses in GraphPad Prism.
