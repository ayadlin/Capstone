Abstract
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an effective targeted therapy in HER2-overexpressing human breast carcinoma.
However, many HER2-positive patients initially or eventually become resistant to this treatment, so elucidating
mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance that emerge in breast carcinoma cells is clinically important. Here, we
show that autocrine motility factor (AMF) binds to HER2 and induces cleavage to the ectodomain-deleted and
constitutively active form p95HER2. Mechanistic investigations indicated that interaction of AMF with HER2
triggers HER2 phosphorylation and metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and ablating the ability of trastuzumab to
inhibit breast carcinoma cell growth. Furthermore, we found that HER2 expression and AMF secretion were
inversely related in breast carcinoma cells. On the basis of this evidence that AMF may contribute to HER2mediated breast cancer progression, our ﬁndings suggest that AMF–HER2 interaction might be a novel target
for therapeutic management of patients with breast cancer, whose disease is resistant to trastuzumab. Cancer Res;

Introduction
HER2 (ERBB2/Neu), a family member of EGF receptors
(HER) is overexpressed in approximately 25% of invasive breast
carcinomas (1–3) and is a major approved target for breast
cancer therapy. The crystal structure of HER2 suggests that its
extracellular domain (ECD) exists in a constitutively active
conformation resembling the ligand-bound state of the other
HERs (4, 5), whereas HER2-ECD–targeting antibodies that are
antagonistic or agonistic at the levels of HER2 phosphorylation
and cell growth, suggest the presence of binding partner(s)
necessary for complete activation of HER2 (1, 6, 7). Herceptin/
trastuzumab has improved the outcome in patients with
HER2-overexpressing breast carcinoma (8, 9). However, a
substantial proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer is intrinsically resistant to trastuzumab or acquires
resistance following initial treatment (10). The mechanisms of
resistance to Herceptin/trastuzumab are mainly involved in
the restoration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways either via
an epitope masking (Mucin) and escaping (truncated
p95HER2), alternative compensation of receptor tyrosine
kinases, or the constitutive mutations of phosphoinositideAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Oncology and 2Pathology, Wayne

3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (10–12). Retrospective studies suggest that the oncogenic p95HER2 variant is most likely responsible for clinical resistance to Herceptin/trastuzumab treatment (13, 14).
Phosphoglucose isomerase (EC: 5.3.1.9; PGI) is a housekeeping dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization
of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (15). PGI belongs to the moonlighting
family of proteins having multiple functions/activities within
a single polypeptide chain, not resulting from multiple
domains of a protein, alternative RNA splicing, gene fusions,
and/or posttranslational processing (16). Secreted form of PGI
in the extracellular milieu of transformed cells and several
tissues was identiﬁed as neuroleukin (NLK), a neurotrophic
factor that mediates the differentiation of neurons and autocrine motility factor (AMF), a tumor-secreted C–X–X–C cytokine that is involved in cell motility (17, 18). Aberrant secretion
of AMF was observed in the blood and urine of patients with
cancer, suggesting a prognostic value (15, 19). Functionally,
AMF was shown to induce cell proliferation, differentiation,
and survival of various cancer and immune cells (15). Independent reports have shown that AMF activates mitogenic
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK or prosurvival
PI3K/AKT pathways, similarly to the signaling mode of growth
factors as emphasized in the resistance to HER2-targeted
therapy (20, 21). The receptor of AMF, that is, gp78/AMFR was
identiﬁed as a 7 transmembrane domain containing protein.
However, gp78/AMFR-null cells still respond to AMF, suggesting the presence of yet another unidentiﬁed receptor (22, 23).
Here, we show that in human breast carcinoma cells AMF
binds to HER2, induces its phosphorylation, ectodomain shedding, activates its downstream signaling pathways, and

overcomes Heceptin/trastuzumab effect. The data suggest
that AMF may be a novel therapeutic target for patients with
breast cancer in conjunction with Heceptin/trastuzumab
therapy.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and chemicals
Puriﬁed rabbit PGI/AMF was purchased from Sigma for
AMF stimulation. Monoclonal anti-PGI (12F9A6, Pﬁzer) and
rabbit anti-PGI (H300, Santa Cruz) antibodies were used for
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. p-ERK (E-4),
ERK1/2(MK1), p-Tyr (PY20), anti-HER2-ICD (Neu, C-18), antiHER2-ECD (9G6), p-HER2 antibodies, and lapatinib were
purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-p-AKT (Ser473) and AKT
antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Anti-rabbit IgG-TRITC
and anti-IgG-FITC antibodies, Marimastat (BB2516), lysophophatidic acid, and pertussis toxin (P2980) were purchased from
Sigma. Wortmannin and U0126 were obtained from Calbiochem. 3,30 -Dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) [DTSSP]
was purchased from Pierce. Trastuzumab was a kind gift from
Dr. Wei-Zen Wei of Wayne State University (Detroit, MI). AntiV5, anti-HER2-ECD antibodies (poly-2 and CB11 clone), siRNAs
against gp78, HER2, and AMF were purchased from Invitrogen.
MTT was purchased from Sigma.
Cell culture and treatments
T47D and EBNA 293 cells obtained from American Type
Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. SkBr3
and BT474 were kindly gifted by Dr. Arun Rishi of Wayne State
University. SkBr3 cells were cultured in complete McCoy's
modiﬁed 5A medium. Before pretreatment with inhibitors or
addition of stimulators (EGF, AMF), 50% conﬂuent cells were
rinsed 2 times with 1 PBS and then serum-starved for
16 hours.
Cross-linking with DTSSP was conducted to identify interaction of AMF (AMF-V5) and HER2. T47D cells were washed
with 1 PBS and then exposed to AMF (AMF-V5) along with
DTSSP for 1 hour at 4 C. Reactions were terminated by the
addition of 20 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were extracted with lysis buffer and
insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and supernatants were processed for immunoprecipitation.
Transfection and RNA interference
Expression plasmid of AMF-V5 was constructed in
pCDNA3.1/V5 (Invitrogen) harboring human full-length
PGI/AMF and conﬁrmed by sequence analysis. CMV-HER2
(p185HER2) was purchased from Addgene and transiently
transfected into EBNA293 cells using Fugene HD (Roche).
Breast cancer cells were seeded at 50% conﬂuence per well
in 6-well plates overnight and transfected for 48 hours with 20
nmol/L siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation was conducted
according to routine protocol. Brieﬂy, the cells were extracted

in lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% NP-40, 2.5 mmol/L
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 1
mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mg/mL leupeptin]. After BCA protein
assay (Pierce), immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibodies (1 mg) was carried out overnight. Each experiment was
repeated at least, twice.
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry
For immunoﬂuorescence studies, SkBr3 cells grown on 12mm round coverslips (Fisher) were processed after AMF-V5
treatment for 15 minutes. The cells were washed and ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. For double immunoﬂuorescence labeling, the cells were incubated with primary
antibodies (anti-HER2 and anti-V5) for 1 hour separately to
minimize the cross-reactivity. After 3 washes, appropriate
secondary antibodies (ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-conjugated, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate [TRITC]-conjugated) were also incubated separately. Immunoﬂuorescence
images were obtained using a Zeiss Confocal Laser Microscope LSM 510. Four micrometer sections obtained from
formalin ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue blocks were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, and microwaved on high 2 for 5
minutes in 1 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The
sections were washed 3 in PBS and blocked with Super
Block (Skytek Laboratories) for 10 minutes. Sequential sections were then incubated in PBS and linked with biotinylated mouse anti-AMF antibodies at 4 C overnight. The
sections were then washed 3 for 10 minutes each in PBS
and linked with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) followed by Texas Red–conjugated Avidin. After washing, the sections were incubated at 4 C
overnight with rabbit anti-HER2 antibodies (Invitrogen) and
with ﬂuorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Images were documented with an OLYMPUS BX40
microscope supported by a DP72 CCD Camera, and CellSens
Dimension Imaging Software (Olympus).
Cell growth assay
BT474 cells were seeded at a density of 5  104 cells per well
in 24-well plates. After 24 hours, cells were treated with either
40 mg/mL trastuzumab or a combination of AMF (90 nmol/L)
with trastuzumab. Cell growth was monitored at 550 nm after
MTT assay. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicates
and repeated twice. Statistical analysis was done using Student
t test. P < 0.005 was regarded as signiﬁcant.
Cell migration assay
Transwell (Corning Costar) migration assays were conducted on SkBr3 cells following pretreatment with trastuzumab for 16 hours. A total of 5  104 SkBr3 cells in serum-free
medium were introduced into the upper compartment of
Transwell chambers (8 mmol/L pore) and were allowed to
migrate in lower chambers with 10% FBS or AMF (0.1 mg/mL)
for 16 hours. Migrated cells were ﬁxed and stained with Hema3 stain kit (Fisher). Each condition was assayed in triplicate and
each experiment was repeated 3 times.

Autocrine Motility Factor Promotes HER2 Signaling

Results

ed by HER receptors and implying the responsibility of gp78/
AMFR for partial suppression by lapatinib (Fig. 1D). To study
whether a GPCR mediates AMF-induced p-AKT/p-ERK,
we conducted suppression studies using pertussis-toxin
(G protein inhibitor) or Marimastat (MMPs inhibitor) for
blocking GPCR signaling. We found that these inhibitors did
not suppress AMF-induced p-AKT/p-ERK (Fig. 1E), signifying that AMF signaling is not linked to GPCR but independently activates EGFR and/or HER2.

AMF induces PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways in a HER
family dependent manner
To study whether AMF acts independently of HER2 signaling, we initially established whether AMF induces PI3K/
MAPK signaling pathways through gp78/AMFR in low HER2expressing breast cancer cell line T47D. Treatment with
puriﬁed AMF showed that it activates both PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/ERK (Fig. 1A–C). Furthermore, gp78/AMFR knockdown study revealed that gp78/AMFR mediates AMFinduced p-ERK but not p-AKT, suggesting involvement of
another AMF receptor for AKT activation (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Because participation of a pertussis-toxin sensitive
G protein in the signal transduction of AMF-stimulated cell
motility was previously reported (24), we ventured that
presence of yet another AMF receptor might be a G protein
coupled receptor (GPCR), which transactivates the HER
family through ectodomain shedding of membrane-bound
HER ligand precursors by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP),
resulting in the activation of PI3K/MAPK pathways (25).
Therefore, we tested whether AMF is involved in the transactivation of the HER family for AKT activation. Interestingly, the results show that AMF-induced p-AKT/p-ERK was
partially suppressed by lapatinib [dual kinase inhibitor of
EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2] compared with control and
EGF, indicating that AMF-induced p-AKT/p-ERK is mediat-

AMF induces phosphorylation of HER2 and enhances its
cleavage
As HERs phosphorylation is induced by homo- and heterodimerization following the engagement of HER ligand and a
cognate receptor (2), we addressed whether AMF induces the
phosphorylation of EGFR and/or HER2. As shown in Fig. 2A,
phosphorylation of both EGFR and HER2 were induced by
exogenous EGF, which does not bind to HER2 (2, 3), implying
EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization. While AMF did not induce
phosphorylation of EGFR and kinetic studies indicated that
AMF induces the phosphorylation of HER2 within a very short
time frame of 2 minutes (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we found that both
background p-HER2 and unphosphorylated p185HER2 vanished concomitantly with the emergence of cleaved p95HER2.
As ectodomain shedding of p185HER2 was previously reported
to generate membrane-anchored p95HER2 (95 to 100 kDa) by

sheddases such as MMPs at the juxtamembrane region of
HER2 (26), we addressed whether HER2 cleavage is directly
affected by AMF or is mediated by MMPs. MMPs inhibitor
suppressed AMF-induced cleavage of p185HER2 and also
stabilized phosphorylated HER2 by AMF (Fig. 2C), indicating
that AMF is sufﬁcient for the phosphorylation of HER2 and
AKT activation and also cooperates with MMPs for HER2
cleavage.
Parental EBNA293 cells did not show AKT/ERK activation
after AMF treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). To verify that
AMF indeed triggers phosphorylation and participates in the
cleavage of HER2, the p185HER2 expression vector was transfected into EBNA293 cells. The results showed that p-HER2
induction in response to AMF seemed together with cleaved
p95HER2 (Fig. 2D) and AMF-induced HER2 cleavage was
mediated by MMPs (Fig. 2E), consistent with the earlier results
(Fig. 2B and C). We conﬁrmed the existence of AMF/HER2/

AKT axis by HER2 knockdown in T47D cells, in which AMFinduced AKT activation was partially suppressed (Fig. 2F).
AMF interacts with the extracellular domain of HER2
Because the data indicate that AMF induces phosphorylation of HER2, we tested the interaction of exogenously added
AMF and HER2, using a membrane impermeable cross-linker
(DTSSP), which establishes extracellular association of proteins. Exogenous AMF was coimmunoprecipitated with HER2
(Fig. 3A, top). To further verify this interaction V5-tagged AMF
(AMF-V5) was expressed and puriﬁed to rule out any possible
background experimental noise from the endogenous AMF.
The interaction of exogenous AMF-V5 with HER2 was clearly
observed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies (Fig.
3A, middle and bottom). In addition, immunoﬂuorescence
studies revealed the colocalization of HER2 and exogenous
AMF-V5 (Fig. 3B).

Figure 3. AMF interacts with HER2. A, serum-starved T47D cells were treated simultaneously with AMF and DTSSP to cross-link extracellular proteins for
1 hour at 4 C. Immunoprecipitation of lysate was conducted as indicated and analyzed by Western blot analysis of SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions, which
reverses the cross-linking and allows for identifying interacting proteins. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with anti-HER2-ICD following AMF
treatment (top). AMF-V5 treated and cross-linked cells were used for reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-HER2-ICD (middle) or anti-V5 (bottom). Control
indicates AMF or AMF-V5 obtained from supernatants after their treatment into cells. B, colocalization of HER2 and treated AMF-V5 in serum-starved SkBr3
cells. Merge is shown as HER2, AMF-V5, and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; nuclear stain, blue). Control indicates conditioned medium of
EBNA293 cells transiently transfected with vector (pCDNA3.1/V5) alone. Cells were treated with puriﬁed AMF-V5 for 15 minutes. C, AMF interacts with
ectodomain of HER2. EBNA 293 cells transfected with CMV-HER2 or vector were extracellularly cross-linked along with the treatment of EGF, AMF,
and AMF-V5, respectively, as described. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HER2 antibodies recognizing different epitopes: ECD, ICD, JM
(juxtamembrane). Control indicates bovine serum albumin. D, prediction of interaction of HER2-ECD with human AMF. Ectodomain of HER2 is displayed in
the ball form and human AMF in the ribbon representation. I, II, III, and IV indicate different domains of HER2-ECD.

To elucidate whether AMF interacts with the ectodomain of
HER2, HER2-transfected cells were extracellularly cross-linked
with either exogenous AMF or AMF-V5. We observed that AMF
or AMF-V5 cross-linked HER2 molecules were not immunoprecipitated with anti-HER2-ECD antibodies and immunoprecipitated HER2 levels were reduced compared with trastuzumab (juxtamembrane) or anti-HER2-ICD antibodies (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that AMF–HER2–binding motif is either overlapping or close to the epitope of anti-HER2-ECD antibody. Next,
taking advantage of the data obtained from the crystal structures of AMF and the ECD of HER2 (4, 27), we used the ZDOCK
software (http://zdock.bu.edu) to predict their physical interactions. AMF binding to HER2 ectodomain was mapped to the
molecular region of HER2 between domain I and III (Fig. 3D)
AMF overcomes the Hereceptin/trastuzumab
suppression of PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways
As HER2 overexpressing cells have a high expression level
of endogenous p-HER2 via a ligand-independent mechanism
(1–3), we examined how AMF is able to affect endogenous pHER2 and HER2 in HER2-overexpressing cells. Also, we questioned whether AMF-induced downstream events might be
blocked by anti-HER2-ECD antibodies, which can compete
with AMF for binding to HER2. As shown in Fig. 4A, the

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment with anti-HER2-ECD antibodies alone showed that
it induced p-HER2 levels in concert with HER2 cleavage and
AKT/ERK activation, mimicking AMF actions. Combination of
AMF and anti-HER2-ECD antibodies shows synergistic effect.
Interestingly, HER2 shedding was induced by exogenous AMF
regardless of the presence of Herceptin/trastuzumab in the
conditioned media. AMF treatment overcame Herceptin/trastuzumab–mediated suppression of HER2 cleavage and p-AKT/
p-ERK levels.
Next, as AMF-induced p95HER2 is an indicator of trastuzumab resistance through epitope escaping (10), we proceeded
to validate the effect of AMF on cell growth and motility with
trastuzumab treatment. We observed AMF-induced HER2
cleavage in cells treated with trastuzumab in complete medium (Fig. 4B). As a result, exogenous AMF partially overcame
the inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on cell growth and motility
(Fig. 4C and D).
AMF secretion is controlled by HER2 expression
Next, we examined the relationship between AMF and HER2
expression. AMF secretion was observed to be positively
correlated with the expression of both p95HER2 and p185HER2
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3). Sequentially, we found that
HER2 knockdown inhibits AMF secretion, suggesting that AMF

Figure 4. AMF overcomes inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on cell growth and migration. A, breast cancer cells were starved and treated with trastuzumab
or anti-HER2-ECD (9G6, 20 mg/mL) for 16 hours and then stimulated with AMF for 15 minutes. Quantiﬁcation of p95HER2 represents the average of 2
experiments and error bars indicate SD. B, p95HER2 was analyzed in lysate of BT474 cells grown in complete medium and pretreated with
trastuzumab and then stimulated with AMF for 1 hour. C, BT474 cells were grown for different durations with trastuzumab (Tras) and a combination of
AMF (90 nmol/L) with trastuzumab. The cell growth was monitored using MTT assay. D, effect of AMF on trastuzumab-inhibited cell migration. SkBr3 cells were
pretreated with trastuzumab or control immunoglobulin G (IgG; 10 mg/mL) for 24 hours, and migrated cells were then measured after 16 hours in Transwell
assays. Quantitative data from 3 different experiments were presented.  , P < 0.05. Error bars represent SEM.

secretion is regulated, at least in part by HER2 signaling in
breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 5A). AMF knockdown did not affect
HER2 expression, whereas reduced p-HER2 levels along with
suppression of AKT/ERK activation in T47D cells (Fig. 5B). In
addition, the blocking of AMF function partially inhibited the
phosphorylation of HER2, resulting in the reduction of p-AKT/
p-ERK levels (Fig. 5C) and endogenously secreted AMF does
not signiﬁcantly affect the cleavage of HER2 in HER2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C).
Finally, to further convince that AMF–HER2 relationship is
not only an in vitro phenomena, we conducted 2 independent
immunohistochemistry studies using human breast cancer
tumors and MCF10A DCIS.com xenograft, which is a mouse
model of human comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (28). Compared with the surrounding stroma, both HER2 and AMF were
found to be strongly expressed in the human breast carcinoma
epithelium, and especially colocalized on the cell membranes
of MCF10A DCIS.com xenograft (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
The studies presented earlier show that exogenous AMF
contributes to Herceptin/trastuzumab resistance of human
breast carcinoma cells via generation of p95HER2 fragment.
Because AMF interacts with HER2 and AMF-interacting HER2
is sensitive to HER2 shedding by MMPs, we hypothesize that

1416

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

the interaction between AMF and HER2 could structurally
expose the MMPs enzymatic clip site at HER2 juxtamembrane
region. The expression levels and activation of MMPs might be
considered a critical limiting step of HER2 shedding due to
partial recovery by AMF in trastuzumab-inhibited cell growth
and motility (Fig. 4C and D). Despite the inhibition of MMPs,
presence of AMF was sufﬁcient for phosphorylation of HER2
and activation of PI3K/MAPK (Fig. 2C and D), suggesting that
AMF can act as a HER2-binding partner enhancing its activation. Weather AMF-interacting HER2 underdoes heterodimerization with another member of HER2 family for PI3K/MAPK
activation is yet to be determined.
Because both AKT and ERK activation occurs mostly in the
cellular signaling of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), the mechanism in which gp78/AMFR knockdown showed the suppression of AMF-activated ERK but not AMF-induced AKT is poorly
understood (Supplementary Fig. S1). Of note, gp78 signalingsuppress ERK activation and also acts as an E3 ligase in the
cytoplasm (29).
Transgenic mouse models harboring rat full-length
p185HER2 (Neu) recapitulated the initial events of HER2induced mammary tumorigenesis. A long latency period for
tumor initiation is required for the acquisition of activating
mutations such as in-frame deletion or insertion at the
juxtamembrane region of Neu transgene (30–32). As these

mutations have not been found in human breast cancer,
several studies have suggested epigenetic mechanisms for
the expression of truncated p95HER2, for example, alternative translation initiation or an alternative spliced form of
HER2 resembling Neu-derived somatic mutations (33–35). In
this respect, p95HER has been found in subgroups of human
patients with breast carcinoma, resulting in constitutively
hyperactive dimers with intermolecular disulﬁde bonds
(26, 36). Transgenic recapitulation studies showed that
p95HER2 transgene-induced tumors lead to more aggressive
and metastatic phenotype with relatively short latency period compared with full-length HER2-induced tumors (37).
p95HER2 fragments are suggested to arise through mechanisms of proteolytic shedding by MMPs or translation of
HER2 internal initiation codons (26, 38). In the present
study, AMF-enhanced HER2 shedding suggests that AMF
participates in HER2 oncogenic and aggressive progression
through the epigenetic event of AMF secretion. As HER2
overexpression positively controls AMF secretion (Fig. 5A),
the positive feedback loop of HER2 overexpression, AMF
secretion and p95HER2 generation could be speculated in
HER2-induced cancer progression. AMF secretion may also
be controlled by other mechanisms, as the secretion level of
AMF is higher in high motility cells (MDA-MB-231) compared with low motility cells (T47D), regardless of the similar

expression levels of HER2 by both the cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Although the mechanisms of resistance to Herceptin/
trastuzumab by breast tumors have been delineated at a
preclinical level, it is still to be established in patients and
remain a challenge for the clinicians. In vitro studies suggested Herceptin/trastuzumab could inhibit the shedding of
p185HER2 (36, 39) and retrospective studies in patients with
breast cancer revealed a high association between the
predisposition of p95HER2 and clinical resistance to Herceptin/trastuzumab (8, 9). Previously, AMF was identiﬁed as
a serum tumor marker in patients with breast cancer (18). It
was also reported that Herceptin could effectively block both
ligand-induced and constitutive expression of AMF associated with high HER2 overexpression, implying a role of the
AMF pathway in the action of Herceptin (40). Here, we have
documented that AMF treatment of breast carcinoma cells
suppresses the effect of Herceptin/trastuzumab by overcoming both p-AKT/p-ERK levels and protecting cell growth
through p95HER2 generation (Fig. 4). We suggest that high
AMF-secreting HER2-positive cancer cells could initially
and intrinsically have the advantage of resistance to Herceptin/trastuzumab. Therefore, we propose that AMF
might be a novel therapeutic target in patients with
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and this target should

Cleaved and constitutively active
p95HER2 induces aggressive

breast cancer progression and initial resistance of trastuzumab as depicted in Fig. 6.
