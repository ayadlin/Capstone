Treatment Deintensification and
Symptom Burden in Patients
With Human PapillomavirusAssociated Head and Neck
Cancer
We read with interest the article by Rosenthal et al regarding patterns of symptom burden during radiotherapy
(RT) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for
patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).1
Patient-reported, robust symptom-related data collection is warranted for statistical assumptions in future
HNC trials in which symptom distress takes part of the
endpoints. This is an important issue because recent prospective trials of cancer treatment deintensification in
patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
HNC have attempted to reduce treatment-related toxicity
and patient symptoms while maintaining or improving
established cure rates. This goal is investigated by either
using upfront transoral robotic surgery (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 3311 trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01898494) or upfront induction chemotherapy
followed by response-adapted (low vs standard-dose) RT
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E1308 trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01084083), or by replacing
standard cisplatin chemotherapy with treatment with antiepidermal growth factor receptor (cetuximab) (Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group-1016 trial, ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT01302834).
HPV-associated HNC is a distinct disease entity
with an increasing frequency, and is observed mainly in
nonsmoking, nondrinking younger patients diagnosed
with oropharyngeal cancer with a favorable prognosis.2,3
Since 2000, the worldwide standard treatment for
patients with locally advanced HNC has been CRT.4,5
However, this treatment has not been uniformly adopted
for patients with low-volume TNM stage III or IV oropharyngeal cancer, does not take into consideration the existence
of HPV-driven cancers, and is associated with significant
long-term toxicity.6 Toxicity has largely been ignored
because of an evolved focus on survival as a priority. Given
the very good prognosis of patients with HPV-positive
HNC, one of the first questions is the possibility of omitting
chemotherapy (or replacing it with cetuximab). The
MARCH (Meta-Analysis of Radiotherapy in Carcinomas of
Head and Neck) meta-analysis, which included 6515

patients, demonstrated a similar absolute benefit of survival
(8%) using accelerated RT alone compared with CRT as in
the MACH-NC (Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head
and Neck Cancer) meta-analysis, which included >10,000
patients.4,7,8 In both meta-analyses, the absolute survival
benefit for oropharyngeal cancer was similar.
In patients with HPV-positive HNC, the better
prognosis noted compared with patients with HPVnegative disease is related to increased locoregional control rather than the incidence of distant metastases.3,9 The
majority of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal
cancer present with N2bN3 disease, and therefore have a
risk of developing distant metastases if chemotherapy is
omitted.10,11 Moreover, in a recent meta-analysis, taxanecontaining induction chemotherapy demonstrated an
absolute benefit of 8% in patients with N2N3 HNC.12
Given the good locoregional control but similar
incidence of distant metastases compared with patients
with HPV-negative HNC, a reduction in elective neck
irradiation (total radiation dose or irradiated volume) can
be a solution for deintensification in patients with HPVpositive HNC. The current regimen is to deliver 45 to 50
grays to the uninvolved neck. In the modern RT era, using
positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or high-quality computed tomography, elective neck
dissection or irradiation can be omitted. A recent metaanalysis assessing the detection of cervical lymph node
metastases using modern imaging techniques in patients
with HNC with clinically N0 disease demonstrated that
minimizing morbidity by avoiding elective neck treatment is acceptable in selected cases.13
In conclusion, we are convinced that treatmentrelated long-term toxicity among patients with HNC is
high, and the analysis of patterns of symptom burden as
proposed by Rosenthal et al1 should be used as a benchmark for future symptom intervention clinical trials.

viously acknowledged in the acupuncture literature so comparison of treatment to no intervention is not that useful.4
Additionally, there are a number of problems with
the authors’ choice of a sham:
1. The patients receiving electroacupuncture experienced de
qi, whereas patients receiving sham acupuncture did not.
Clearly, this would have strongly influenced a patient’s
perception of whether he or she was receiving the active
treatment and would have affected expectations.
2. In electroacupuncture, the needles were placed
“around the joint with the most pain” (the distance is
not specified), but in sham acupuncture, the needles
were at least 5 cm from the most painful joint. This
could have affected patient perception as well. As nonpenetrative needles were used in the sham acupuncture
patients, this difference seems unnecessary.
3. Patients randomized to electroacupuncture obviously
received electrical stimulation. Unless this was imperceptible, it also would have affected patient expectations.

Sham Procedure Inadequate
It is unfortunate that Mao et al’s study1 was underpowered
to evaluate whether electroacupuncture is more effective
than sham acupuncture. It is widely recognized that there is
a strong placebo effect present during the study of subjective
responses such as pain2 and anxiety3; this issue has been pre1148

Reply to Sham Procedure
Inadequate
William Hay raises several issues related to our sham acupuncture design, including the lack of de qi sensation,1
