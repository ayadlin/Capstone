The molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic properties of metformin, a ﬁrst-line drug for type 2 diabetes, remain
elusive. Here we report that metformin induces genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation by modulating the activity of
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). Exposing cancer cells to metformin leads to hypermethylation of tumor-promoting
pathway genes and concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation. Metformin acts by upregulating microRNA let-7 through AMPK
activation, leading to degradation of H19 long noncoding RNA, which normally binds to and inactivates SAHH. H19 knockdown
activates SAHH, enabling DNA methyltransferase 3B to methylate a subset of genes. This metformin-induced H19 repression and
alteration of gene methylation are recapitulated in endometrial cancer tissue samples obtained from patients treated with
antidiabetic doses of metformin. Our ﬁndings unveil a novel mechanism of action for the drug metformin with implications for the
molecular basis of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer. This novel mechanism of action also may be occurring in normal cells.

INTRODUCTION
Metformin, a biguanide compound, is among the most commonly
used drugs worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes owing
to its high efﬁcacy and minimal side effects. In recent years, there
has been signiﬁcant interest in metformin as a potential cancer
chemopreventive and/or therapeutic agent (reviewed in Pollak1
and Pryor and Cabreiro2). Despite extensive research and ongoing
multicentered randomized clinical trials on the efﬁcacy of
metformin as an anticancer agent, the antineoplastic mechanisms
of action of this drug remain enigmatic. Both indirect (systemic)
and direct mechanisms have been proposed (reviewed in Pollak,1
Pryor and Cabreiro,2 Foretz et al.,3 and Pavlova and Thompson4).
By altering the endocrine-metabolic milieu of the host that is,
reducing systemic levels of glucose and insulin), metformin may
decrease cancer cell proliferation (reviewed in Pavlova and
Thompson4). However, the magnitude of these systemic effects
may not be sufﬁcient to impact cancer cell growth directly,
especially in patients with normal baseline glucose and insulin
levels or in cancers that are insensitive to insulin. Alternative
systemic effects of metformin have, therefore, been proposed,
including inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and augmentation of host immune response to cancer cells. In contrast, dozens
of other studies using in vitro and/or rodent models suggest that
metformin may directly interact with cancer cells to elicit its
antineoplastic effect. Favored mechanisms, to date, include
induction of ‘energy stress’ (through inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I) and activation of the key energy
sensor AMPK and subsequent mTOR inhibition, thereby leading to

tumor suppression. While alterations in cancer cell metabolism
through both AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent
pathways contribute to the direct cellular effects of metformin,
the precise mechanisms leading to these metabolic changes
have yet to be deﬁned. In addition, it remains to be determined whether the effects of metformin observed in vitro and in
animal models actually occur in human tissues and in particular,
whether conventional antidiabetic doses of metformin are
adequate to achieve these effects, in part, because most
preclinical studies to date have used drug levels signiﬁcantly
higher than those used in patients with diabetes. Adequately
addressing these questions will be key to the success of
‘repurposing’ metformin for its potential use as a cancer
chemopreventive or therapeutic agent.
We previously reported that metformin reduces the motility and
invasiveness of both endometrial and ovarian cancer cells in part
by decreasing the production of H19.5 H19 is a long noncoding
RNA that is highly expressed during fetal development but
strongly downregulated in most adult tissues. Interestingly,
however, H19 is aberrantly expressed in almost all cancer types
tested, where it has been shown to play an important role in
tumor biology (reviewed in Matouk et al.6 and Raveh et al.7). We
recently found in muscle cells (murine) that H19 alters DNA
methylation genome-wide through its interaction with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), the only eukaryotic enzyme
capable of hydrolyzing S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a strong
feedback inhibitor of SAM-dependent methyltransferases including DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). H19 binds to SAHH and

inhibits its hydrolytic activity.8 We showed that in mouse skeletal
muscle cells decreasing H19 by siRNA activates SAHH and
facilitates the removal of SAH, which in turn relieves the inhibition
of DNMT3B by SAH and enables it to methylate a subset of genes.8
Exposing human endometrial or ovarian cancer cells to metformin
decreases H19 levels (although how metformin decreases H19
remains to be investigated), with a concomitant increase in
methylation within the promoter region of H19.5 Whether this
methylation change is mechanistically linked to metformin’s
action in cancer cells or is just coincidental remains to be
investigated. These ﬁndings raise the intriguing possibility that
metformin may function to alter gene methylation in
malignant cells.
Here, we show that metformin induces let-7-mediated
H19 degradation through activation of AMPK. Exposing endometrial cancer cells to metformin leads to global DNA
methylation changes mediated through the H19/SAHH
axis. Impressively, these same metformin-induced H19
repression and gene methylation changes are also observed in
human tumor samples derived from endometrial cancer
patients treated with metformin. These studies provide further
support for the notion that the dose range of metformin
commonly used for the treatment of diabetes has the potential
to directly impact cancer cell biology through an AMPKdependent mechanism.

RESULTS
Metformin increases H19 methylation through the H19/SAHH axis
We previously observed that treatment of the endometrial cancerderived cell line ARK2 with the biguanide antidiabetes drug
metformin results in a decrease in H19 levels and an increase in
methylation within the promoter region of H19.5 Whether these
changes were mediated by the H19/SAHH axis, however, as
previously had reported in normal mouse muscle cells8 was
unclear. To address this possibility, we ﬁrst asked whether
downregulation of H19 following metformin exposure would
activate SAHH. ARK2 cells were incubated with metformin
followed by measurement of H19 levels and SAHH activity 24 h
later. Metformin treatment reduced H19 levels by ~ 4-fold
(Figure 1a), and increased SAHH activity by ~ 20% (Figure 1b)
without affecting its protein level (Figure 1c). Importantly,
knockdown of H19 expression using siH195 to levels comparable
to those induced by metformin(Figure 1d, compared with
Figure 1a) also increased SAHH activity by ~ 20% (Figure 1e)
without altering the level of this protein (Figure 1f). Moreover, the
physical interaction between SAHH and H19, which previously had
been observed in mouse muscle cells,8 also was observed in ARK2
cells by RNA immunoprecipitation. Using an SAHH-speciﬁc antibody (Anti-SAHH8), we observed an ~ 8-fold enrichment of H19 in
SAHH-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) relative to
control immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoprecipitates (Figure 1g,
left column), whereas a GAPDH mRNA (control) was not enriched

under these circumstances (right column). Together, these results
support the hypothesis that metformin-induced downregulation
of H19 activates SAHH in human endometrial cancer cells.
Changes in SAHH activity change could potentially affect all
DNMTs, including DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Here we
focused initial studies on DNMT3B, because it previously has
been shown to be associated with the H19/SAHH pathway.8 To
determine whether DNMT3B may contribute to the observed
metformin-induced H19 promoter methylation, DNMT3B was
downregulated in ARK2 cells using siDnmt3b,9 and the effects
on H19 promoter methylation were evaluated using quantitative
methylation-speciﬁc PCR (QMSP).8 While metformin increased H19
promoter methylation (Figure 1h, compare second bar with ﬁrst
bar on left) as previously reported,5 the combination of this drug
with Dnmt3b knockdown (Figure 1i) restored the level of H19
promoter methylation to that of the control (Figure 1h, third and
fourth bars on right). These results suggest that DNMT3B may
contribute to metformin-induced H19 hypermethylation, although
possible contributions from other DNMTs cannot be excluded at
this time.
Let-7 mediates metformin-induced H19 destabilization
Our previous studies from mouse muscle cells revealed a double
negative-feedback loop between H19 and let-7 in which H19
blocks let-7 function by sequestering let-7, while binding of let-7
to H19 triggers H19 degradation.10,11 Since metformin decreases
the steady-state level of H19 in ARK2 cells (Figure 1a and see Yan
et al.5), we anticipated that metformin also might induce H19
degradation by upregulating let-7. In fact, exposing the human
breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to metformin has been reported to
increase let-7 levels, but the underlying mechanism of this
metformin effect has never been determined.12 To test whether
metformin might effect let-7 levels in endometrial cancer cells,
ARK2 cells were incubated with metformin, followed by measurement of both let-7 and H19 RNA levels at 12 and 24 h. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the increase in let-7 levels (Figure 2a)

coincides with a decrease in H19 levels (Figure 2b) at both time
points tested. RNA stability analyses revealed an accelerated
degradation of H19 (Figure 2c) but not of RPL22 (ribosomal
protein L22; control) mRNA (Figure 2d) in the presence of
metformin. In addition, transfection of a let-7 mimic into ARK2
also destabilized H19 (Figure 2e) but not RPL22 mRNA (Figure 2f).
Further, transfection of a let-7 inhibitor iLet-75 abolished
metformin-induced H19 reduction (Supplementary Figure S1).
Together, these results suggest that metformin upregulates let-7
in endometrial cancer cells, resulting in H19 degradation.
Let-7 upregulation involves AMPK activation
Metformin exerts its anticancer effects, in part, by activating
AMPK.1–3 Indeed, we previously have reported increased phosphorylation of AMPK in patient tumor samples taken from patients
participating in a preoperative prospective clinical trial. The
endometrial cancer patients participating in this trial were treated
with 1500–2250 mg/day, which is in the range of metformin used
to treat diabetes patients.13 To test whether AMPK activation
might contribute to let-7 upregulation in vitro, ARK2 cells were
incubated with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR),
an AMPK-activating agent,14 followed by measurement of let-7
and H19 RNA levels. AICAR treatment led to an increase in let-7
RNA levels at both the 12 and 24 h time points (Figure 3a), with a
concomitant decrease in H19 levels (Figure 3b). As expected,
treatment of ARK2 cells with metformin or with AICAR increased
AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172, consistent with AMPK activation
(Figure 3c).13,15 Together, these results support the hypothesis
that AMPK activation by metformin contributes to let-7 upregulation in endometrial cancer cells.
KSRP is a key factor in promoting processing of let-7 precursors
to mature let-7.16 To test whether KSRP also might play a role in
metformin-induced let-7 upregulation, KSRP knockdown experiments using a KSRP-speciﬁc siRNA (siKsrp17) were conducted in
the presence or absence of metformin, followed by measurement
of let-7 and H19 RNA levels in ARK2 cells. siKsrp treatment reduced

In control siRNA-transfected cells, metformin increased let-7
(Figure 3f, left two columns) and decreased H19 RNA levels
(Figure 3g, left two columns). These effects were lost when KSRP
was downregulated (Figures 3f and g, right two columns),
suggesting that KSRP is required for metformin-induced let-7
upregulation and subsequent H19 destabilization.
The H19/SAHH/DNMT3B pathway mediates metformin effects in
other cancer cells
To address the possibility that the H19/SAHH/DNMT3B pathway
mediates metformin effects in other cancer cells, we tested the
effects of metformin on the human breast cancer-derived cell line
MCF-7. As mentioned above, previous studies have shown that
metformin treatment results in an increase in let-7 levels in breast
cancer-derived MCF-7 cells.12 Here we conﬁrmed and extended
these results by demonstrating that metformin (or AICAR)
treatment leads to an increase in let-7 (Figure 4a), a decrease in
H19 (Figure 4b) and an increase in SAHH activity (Figure 4c) in
MCF-7 cells. Metformin treatment also results in increased H19
promoter methylation in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4d, left two columns),
and this increase could be abrogated (Figure 4d, right two
columns) by repression of DNMT3B expression using siDnmt3b
(Figure 4e). Similar results were observed in human liver cancer
cell lines (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that
the H19/SAHH/DNMT3B axis is active in multiple cancer types,
where it can mediate metformin-induced hypermethylation of
H19.
Metformin alters DNA methylation genome-wide
Given that siRNA-mediated H19 knockdown alters DNA methylation genome-wide in mouse muscle cells,8 and that metformin
Oncogene (2017) 2345 – 2354

downregulates H19 (Figure 1a),5 we sought to determine whether
exposure of endometrial cancer cells to metformin would induce
changes in global DNA methylation. Thus, ARK2 cells were
incubated with metformin for 48 h, followed by genomescale DNA methylation proﬁling using previously described
methods.8 Metformin treatment led to extensive methylation
changes genome-wide compared with control-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Data S1, and Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE85974). Some
genes became hypermethylated, others became hypomethylated
and a third group showed no signiﬁcant change in methylation.
These observations were reminiscent of our previous ﬁndings
studying siRNA-mediated H19 downregulation in mouse muscle
cells.8 The differential effects of metformin on gene methylation
were not surprising since these changes likely reﬂect a composite
of both the direct and indirect effects of metformin. For example,
activation of SAHH as a result of H19 repression by metformin
would facilitate not only DNA methylation by DNMTs (direct
effects) but also methylation of proteins that regulate chromatin
structures (and DNMT accessibility), which in turn could inﬂuence
DNA methylation (indirect effects). Indeed, the methylation status
of a given gene is determined not only by activation of DNMTs but
also by modiﬁcations of chromatin-bound proteins.18–20
Thus, it is reasonable to predict that a subset of the genes that
become hypermethylated following metformin treatment may
result from the direct effect of metformin. To test this hypothesis
we randomly selected four genes from the top 2000 gene list
showing strong hypermethylation in the promoter region to test
as proof of principle (in addition to H19) following metformin
treatment (Supplementary Data S1). Among these genes, DMRTA2
encodes a transcription factor involved in human female germ cell
development;21 KCNG2 encodes a potassium channel subunit
whose altered expression has been associated with malignant glial

tumors;22 and PSMD10 encodes a regulatory subunit of the 26S
proteasome. Constitutive activation of this gene contributes to
hepatocarcinogenesis.23 TRA2A encodes an RNA binding protein
involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Its increased
expression has been found in hepatocellular carcinoma.24 ARK2
cells were again incubated with metformin (or control) in the
presence or absence of the pharmacological SAHH inhibitor DEA.8
QMSP analysis was performed 48 h later using primers that
speciﬁcally amplify a single differentially methylated region (DMR)
of the genes chosen for further study. Metformin increased
methylation in all ﬁve genes tested (Figure 5a, compare blue bars
with brown bars). However, the combination of metformin with
DEA restored the methylation of all ﬁve genes to control levels
(compare green bars with blue bars), consistent with metformininduced, SAHH-dependent regulation of methylation at these
DMRs. To address whether DNMT3B was the downstream effector
of this observed regulation (Figure 4d), DNMT3B was downregulated by siDnmt3b and the effects on methylation in the
presence or absence of metformin treatment were examined.
While metformin predictably increased methylation (Figure 5b,
compare second bars with ﬁrst bars, on left), its combination with
DNMT3B knockdown restored methylation levels to control levels
(Figure 5b, compare third bars with fourth bars), providing
evidence to support the involvement of DNMT3B in this regulatory
pathway. Taken together, these results are consistent with the
notion that metformin can induce methylation changes at
numerous genomic loci and that a subset of these changes is
mediated through metformin’s effects on the H19/SAHH/DNMT3B
pathway.
Metformin induces hypermethylation of tumor-promoting
pathway genes
To provide biological insight into the observed metformininduced methylation changes, we performed Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA; see Albitar et al.25). Based on the common but
admittedly oversimpliﬁed assumption that hypermethylation is

associated with gene repression (and hypomethylation with gene
activation), we stratiﬁed genes that showed signiﬁcant methylation changes (P-value o0.05) into three categories depending on
the location of methylation: promoter only (category 1), gene
body only (category 2), and both promoter and gene body
(category 3). While no activation or inhibition of genes in
categories 1 or 3 were found to be statistically signiﬁcant (based
on a cutoff of z-score of o − 2 being inhibition and 42 being
activation), a subset of tumor-promoting pathway genes was
inactivated in category 2. These included those genes encoding
proteins involved in the development of cancers of epithelial
tissues (Supplementary Data S2, red highlighted). Interestingly, in
the same category, genes involved in neuronal development and
function, cell morphology, and intercellular communications also
were observed to be activated.
As many cancer genes function to promote cell proliferation
and/or survival, we tested whether metformin treatment might
negatively effect these biological end points. Thus, ARK2 and
MCF-7 cells were exposed to metformin for 48 h, followed by cell
viability and caspase-3/7 activity assays. Metformin treatment
reduced cell viability without affecting caspase activity in both cell
types (Supplementary Figure S3), consistent with the role of this
pathway in regulating cell proliferation but not cell survival.
Metformin-induced H19 repression and associated gene
methylation changes are recapitulated in patient tumor samples
We previously reported that preoperative treatment of patients
with endometrial cancer using antidiabetic doses of metformin
decreased tumor cell proliferation with a concomitant increase in
AMPK activation.13 Here we wanted to test whether similar levels
of metformin treatment in patients with endometrial cancer
would also result in changes in H19 expression and/or alterations
in gene methylation. Thus, metformin was administered preoperatively to ﬁve endometrial cancer patients (see
Supplementary Table S1 for patient characteristics) for 3–12 weeks.

methylation were measured in tumor tissue samples from both
pre- and postoperative samples. As previously reported,13
preoperative metformin treatment resulted in an increase in
AMPK phosphorylation (Figure 6a) as well as decreased tumor cell
proliferation (Figure 6b). Strikingly, metformin treatment also
resulted in decreased H19 levels (Figure 6c) and increased
methylation in each of the ﬁve genes (Figure 6d) previously
tested in vitro (see Figure 5a).
DISCUSSION
Using human cancer cell lines as a model system, we show that
metformin functions to alter DNA methylation in a genome-wide
fashion and that this action is at least in part mediated by the H19/
SAHH/DNMT3B axis. As illustrated in Figure 6e, exposing cells to
metformin activates AMPK leading to increased levels of let-7,
which in turn targets H19 for degradation. This frees SAHH from
sequestration by H19, which would otherwise prevent it from
hydrolyzing SAH, a feedback inhibitor of DNMT3B, with an end
point of increased DNA methylation. The biological signiﬁcance of
these results is highlighted by the observation of similar ﬁndings
in parallel studies using human endometrial cancer tissue samples
from patients treated with doses of metformin commonly used for
the treatment of diabetes. Together, these studies provide strong
support for a direct role of metformin in regulation of those gene
expression events that play a vital role in aspects of cancer cell
biology. Given that this regulatory pathway also appears to
function in other cancer cell types (Figure 4 and data not shown),
and that diverse types of cancer cells express H19 (reviewed in
Matouk et al.6 and Raveh et al.7), our ﬁndings support the
conclusion which have proposed that metformin warrants further
clinical investigation as both a chemopreventative agent and as a
potential therapeutic agent in certain cancer patients.
Moreover, our studies establish an important mechanistic link
between metformin and H19 promoter hypermethylation. It is
intriguing to speculate that H19 degradation as a result of AMPK
activation and let-7 upregulation induced by metforminmay serve
as an initial trigger that ultimately leads to chronic inhibition of
Oncogene (2017) 2345 – 2354

H19 transcription due to promoter hypermethylation. Such a
feedforward mechanism would help to reinforce metformin’s
action on H19 repression in cancer cells.
These ﬁndings also identify a new mechanism of epigenetic
dysregulation in cancer cells. Many mechanisms have been
proposed to explain H19’s role in tumor initiation and progression,
including inhibition of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma Rb
through H19-encoded miR-675;26,27 alteration of gene transcription via interaction with Polycomb repressive complex 2
components;28 and sequestration and inhibition of the tumor
suppressor microRNA let-7.5,11 Our studies suggest that another
mechanism of H19-mediated carcinogenesis may also be at play:
genome-wide dysregulation of gene methylation. Since the initial
discovery of methylation changes in speciﬁc genes in primary
human tumors,29 epigenetic dysregulation has been increasingly
recognized as a hallmark of cancer30,31 (reviewed in Sandoval and
Esteller32). Three types of alterations in DNA methylation have
been documented in cancers: hypermethylation, hypomethylation
and loss of imprinting. Epigenetic alterations in tumors also
include histone modiﬁcations and H19-induced SAHH activity
changes which itself could alter histone modiﬁcation. We propose
here that H19, in conjunction with SAHH, may contribute to
alterations in the epigenetic landscape in cancer cells. Similar to
other hallmarks of cancer, H19 may therefore also serve as a useful
biomarker for such clinical applications as predicting cancer
recurrence, metastasis, or even as a potential marker predicting
therapeutic response, since DNA methylation-based biomarkers
have found increasing utility in the clinic in recent years (reviewed
in Sandoval and Esteller32).
While the proposal that metformin induces hypermethylation
of certain tumor-promoting pathway genes (Supplementary
Table S2) is consistent with metformin’s proposed anticancer
mechanism of action, we acknowledge that this interpretation is
based on the assumption that hypermethylation will result in
inhibition of gene expression. In fact, the relationship between
methylation and gene expression is far more complex; not only is
it genomic context-dependent, it is also inﬂuenced (positively and
negatively) by factors such as distance between CpGs relative to

transcription start-sites and whether these sites are localized in
promoters, enhancers or gene bodies. Adding an additional layer
of complexity, the patterns and types of modiﬁcations to
chromatin-bound proteins also can affect gene expression.18–20
We further acknowledge that the changes we have observed in
SAHH activity could potentially affect many SAM-dependent
methyltransferases that methylate other cellular components (for
example, methylated proteins). We, therefore, propose here that it
is ultimately the net affect of metformin’s inﬂuence on gene
expression, mediated at least in part via DNA methylation, that
results in its anticancer potential.
Based on these results, we propose that metformin warrants
further study as a potential anticancer agent, including the
mechanisms, such as regulation of gene expression, that may
contribute to this anticancer activity. In this regard, metformin has
been widely prescribed not only for the treatment of diabetes
(type 2) but also for the prevention of diabetes in patients with
insulin resistance. The patients included in our study were not
diabetic but did have insulin resistance/glucose intolerance. There
is, therefore, precedent for the safe use of metformin in
endometrial cancer patients (for the prevention of diabetes), as
well as an extensive history of using this drug in humans (for
diabetes), suggesting that the risk proﬁle associated with this
drug, as part of future testing as an anticancer agent, should be
acceptable. Therefore, metformin is potentially useful in the
prevention of diabetes in endometrial cancer patients.
In conclusion, our studies extend the known mechanisms by
which metformin can exert its effects on gene expression in
cancer cells, and demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that metformin is
able to directly impact cancer cell proliferation by altering DNA
methylation via regulation of the H19/SAHH axis. These studies
further suggest that this mode of action may contribute to the
observed and predicted anticancer activities of metformin in vivo.
Future studies aimed at developing a better understanding of the
molecular interplay between various epigenetic factors will be
required to more fully appreciate the speciﬁc role of metformininduced epigenetic modiﬁcations in speciﬁc cancers, such as
endometrial and breast cancer, and such studies should be

complemented through the conduct of ongoing clinical trials of
metformin as a potential chemopreventative agent in endometrial
cancer—particularly in high-risk populations (https://clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/show/NCT01697566). It remains to be determined
whether this newly identiﬁed metformin mechanism also exists
in non-cancerous cells.

NY, USA) Calbiochem (Billerica, MA, USA), and Santa Cruz, respectively.
Metformin and AICAR were used at ﬁnal concentrations of 2 and 0.5 mM,
respectively.

Cell culture and siRNA/iLet-7 transfection
The ARK2 and MCF-7 cells were authenticated and were free from
mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, USA; 11965-092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, heat inactivated, 1% amphotericin B, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
and 1% L-glutamine. Cells were transfected in a 48-well plate scale. To
prepare siRNA transfection solution for each well, 16 pmol of siCon or
siH19 was mixed with 50 μl OPTI-MEM by gentle pipetting. In parallel,
0.5 μl Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 50 μl OPTI-MEM. Following
5 min of incubation at room temperature, the two were mixed by gentle
pipetting and incubated for 20–30 min at room temperature to allow

siRNA/lipid complexes to form. At the end of incubation, the 100 μl
transfection solution was used to re-suspend cell pellet (4 × 104 cells). After
incubation at room temperature for 10 min, regular growth medium was
added at a ratio of 1:5 (1 volume of transfection solution/5 volumes of
growth medium) and the cell suspension was transferred to the culture
plate. After 12 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was replaced
with fresh growth medium. RNAs and proteins were extracted and
analyzed at the indicated time points following transfection. For
metformin/iLet-7 experiments, 45 pmol of iLet-7 or control inhibitor were
used for each well of cells.

In vivo SAHH activity assay
The experiments were performed in a 96-well scale using the Human
Homocysteine (Hcy) ELISA Kit (Mybiosource, San Diego, CA, USA;
MBS260128) that allows quantitative measurement of homocysteine
concentration in cell extracts, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The concentration of homocysteine in cell extracts was used as a readout
for in vivo SAHH activity,8 as SAHH hydrolyzes SAH to homocysteine and
adenosine. Brieﬂy, ARK2 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline and lysed on plate in 200 μl of lysis buffer (40 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, 75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 15 mM
EDTA). The lysate was cleared of insoluble materials by centrifugation at
15 000 g at 4 °C for 15 min. Immediately following the centrifugation,
100 μl of the supernatant was collected and used for SAHH activity
measurement. The absorbance of the samples was determined using a
FilterMax F3&F5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).

RNA stability analysis
To evaluate let-7 effects on H19 RNA stability, miRNA transfection (48-well
plate scale) combined with actinomycin D time course analysis was
performed. To prepare transfection cocktail, 1 pmol of control miRNA
(miCon) or let-7a mimic was mixed with 50 μl of OPTI-MEM. In parallel,
0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 50 μl of OPTI-MEM. Following
5 min of incubation, the two solutions were mixed and incubated at room
temperature for 20 min. The resulting 100 μl of transfection cocktail was
added to ARK2 cells pre-washed with OPTI-MEM. Upon adding the
transfection cocktail, actinomycin D was also added to each well at a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 μg/ml. Total RNA was extracted at the indicated time
points, followed by reverse transcriptase–qPCR analysis. Results are
presented after normalization against β-tubulin mRNA levels with 0 time
point RNA levels arbitrarily set as 1.

Western blot analysis
Cell pellets were quickly lysed in ﬁve volumes of 2 × sodium dodecyl
sulfate sample buffer heated at 95 °C for 5 min, with occasional vortexing.
Five to 10 μl of homogenized samples were loaded onto 10% SDS gel,
followed by western blot analysis. The linear dynamic range of each
protein of interest was determined by serial dilutions. Bands on western
blot gels were quantiﬁed using Image J.

Genomic DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was isolated using Quick-gDNA MicroPrep (Zymo, Irvine, CA,
USA; D3021) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase–quantitative PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from cells using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion;
catalog number 12183025). cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript RT
Reagent Kit (Takara, Mountain View, CA, USA; RR037A) in a 20 μl reaction
containing 100–500 ng of total RNA. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was
performed in a 15 μl reaction containing 200–800 ng of total RNA. PCR was
performed by initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. Speciﬁcity was veriﬁed by
melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The threshold cycle
(Ct) values of each sample were used in the post-PCR data analysis. Gene
expression levels were normalized against β-tubulin. Real-time PCR primers
are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

Let-7 miRNA quantiﬁcation
Total RNAs were extracted from ARK2 cells using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit.
Levels of mature let-7 were determined by reverse transcriptase–qPCR
using miScript reverse transcription kit (catalog number 218161) and
miScript SYBR Green PCR kit (catalog number 218073) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. PCR primer sets (miScript primer) speciﬁc for
let-7a (MS00006482) and snRNA U6 (MS00033740) were purchased from
Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The indicated miRNA levels were normalized
against U6.

RNA immunoprecipitation
To prepare antibodies, 20 μl of protein A Sepharose beads were incubated
with 20 μg of monoclonal anti-SAHH antibody or 20 μg of mouse
preimmune IgG in 500 μl IP buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 10 mM EDTA) at 4 °C overnight. The next day,
the beads were washed three times with IP buffer and kept on ice until
used. To prepare cell lysates, ARK2 cells (from 1 well of a 6-well plate) were
harvested and cell pellets resuspended in 600 μl of of freshly prepared lysis
buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem)
and 400 units/ml RNase inhibitor). The suspensions were incubated on ice
for 20 min. After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation, lysates
were precleared using 10 μl of protein A sepharose (NaCl was added to a
ﬁnal concentration of 200 mM), followed by addition of yeast tRNA
(Ambion) to a ﬁnal concentration of 40 μg/ml. The cleared lysates were
transferred to tubes containing antibody or preimmune IgG-coated beads,
and IP was carried out by rotating the tubes at 4 °C for 3 h. Following IP,
the beads were washed ﬁve times with IP buffer by adding 1 ml of the
buffer and rotating the tube at 4 °C for 2 min each time. RNA was extracted
from the beads using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion; catalog number
12183018A). Reverse transcription was performed in a 40 μl reaction
volume using the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit, followed by qPCR.

Quantitative methylation-speciﬁc PCR (QMSP)
Genomic DNA was extracted from ARK2 and MCF-7 cells in one well of sixwell plates using Quick-gDNA MicroPrep. For bisulﬁte treatment, 400–500 ng
of DNA was used for each column using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo;
D5006). Two hundred microliters of water was used to elute DNA from each
column. Real-time qPCR was performed in a 15 μl reaction containing 1 μl of
the eluant using iQSYBRGreen (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Bio-Rad
iCycler. The PCR primers (Supplementary Table S3) for methylated DNA were
used at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.3 μM in each PCR reaction. PCR was
performed by initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of
30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. Speciﬁcity was veriﬁed by melting
curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The threshold cycle (Ct) values
of each sample were used in the post-PCR data analysis. Albumin DNA was
used as loading controls for all QMSP normalization.

Methyl-MiniSeq library construction
Libraries were prepared from 200 to 500 ng of genomic DNA digested with
60 units of TaqαI and 30 units of MspI (NEB) sequentially and then
extracted with Zymo Research (ZR) DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Cat#:
D4003). Fragments were ligated to preannealed adapters containing 5′methyl-cytosine instead of cytosine according to Illumina’s speciﬁed
guidelines (www.illumina.com). Adaptor-ligated fragments of 150–250 and
250–350 bp in size were recovered from a 2.5% NuSieve 1:1 agarose gel
(Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit, ZR Cat#: D4001). The fragments were
then bisulﬁte-treated using the EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit (ZR,
Cat#: D5020). Preparative-scale PCR was performed and the resulting
products were puriﬁed (DNA Clean & Concentrator-ZR, Cat#D4005) for
sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq.

Methyl-MiniSeq sequence alignments and data analysis
Sequence reads from bisulﬁte-treated EpiQuest libraries were identiﬁed
using standard Illumina base-calling software and then analyzed using a
Zymo Research proprietary analysis pipeline, which is written in Python
and used Bismark (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bis
mark/) to perform the alignment. Index ﬁles were constructed using the
bismark_genome_preparation command and the entire reference genome.
The non_directional parameter was applied while running Bismark. All
other parameters were set to default. Filled-in nucleotides were trimmed
off when doing methylation calling. The methylation level of each sampled
cytosine was estimated as the number of reads reporting a C, divided by
the total number of reads reporting a C or T. Fisher’s exact test or t-test was
performed for each CpG site which has at least ﬁve reads coverage, and
promoter, gene body and CpG island annotations were added for each
CpG included in the comparison.

Cell viability and apoptosis
ARK2 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103/
well the night before metformin addition. Cell viability and caspase-3/7
activity were measured 48 h post metformin treatment using the
CellTiterBlue Cell Viability kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the ApoONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay kit (Promega), respectively,
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare differences between
quantitative variables when appropriate. The Fisher’s exact text was used
when appropriate, for comparing categorical variables (contingency
tables). P-values at 0.05 or smaller (two-sided) were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Patients
Study approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Chiba
University. Five patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma were
recruited to the study. All patients signed an informed consent form
according to the institutional guidelines. Eligibility criteria included an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 and
normal renal, liver and cardiac function. Exclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) type 2 diabetes requiring medication; (2) history of metformin use; (3)
an abnormal blood coagulation proﬁle and/or a history of thromboembolism; and (4) the presence of mental or life-threatening illnesses. All
patients were obese with impaired glucose tolerance, but were not
diabetic. Detailed characteristics of the patients are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.
Metformin (initial dose, 750 mg/day; increased weekly up to 1500 or
2250 mg/day) was administered for 3–12 weeks until the day of scheduled
surgery. Patients were not treated with any hormones such as progestin.
Tissue specimens were obtained via endometrial curettage at the time of
initial diagnosis (before treatment) and hysterectomy (after treatment).

Tissue collection and analyses
For RNA extraction, tissue samples collected at surgery were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until RNA extraction. RNA was
extracted from tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA). cDNA was synthesized from 3 to 5 μg RNA using oligodeoxythymidine 12–18 (catalog item 18418-012; Invitrogen) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (catalog item 18064-014; Invitrogen) in a 20 μl
reaction volume according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
qPCR was performed as described above using β-tubulin mRNA as a
loading control.
For immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67, 3-μm-thick sections were
brieﬂy microwaved in 10 mM of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and immunostained
for Ki-67. The Envision FLEX system (K8000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) was
used to observe the immunostaining using an Autostainer S3400 (Dako).
The primary antibody was incubated at room temperature for 60 min at a
dilution of 1:100. The secondary antibody (Envision FLEX/HRP; Dako) was
incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (Dako) was used as a chromogen. The samples were
then counterstained with hematoxylin. Labeling indices for Ki-67 was
presented as the percentage of immunoreactive nuclei of 500 tumor cells.
For AMPK western blot analysis, frozen tissue samples were thawed on
ice, homogenized using a TissueRuptor (Qiagen) and lysed in Complete-M
lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science, Tokyo, Japan) containing Halt
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Wayne, MI,
USA). Lysates (10 mg of protein) were resolved by 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The primary antibodies
were diluted (1:1000 for phospho-AMPKa, AMPKa; and 1:5000 for β-actin)
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody (enhanced
chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G; GE Healthcare) was
incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Signals were detected using
the ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare). Signal
intensity was quantiﬁed using a densitometer (CS Analyzer version 3.0
software; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and normalized to β-actin levels.
For QMSP analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue
samples using the Quick gDNA MicroPrep kit. QMSP was performed as
described for ARK2 cells.
