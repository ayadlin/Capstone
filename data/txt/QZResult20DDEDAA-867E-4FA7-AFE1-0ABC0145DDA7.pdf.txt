Abstract:

Killing of proliferating normal cells limits chemotherapy of cancer. Several strategies
to selectively protect normal cells were previously suggested. Here we further
explored the protection of normal cells from cell cycle-specific chemotherapeutic
agents such as mitotic inhibitors (MI). We focused on a long-term cell recovery
(rather than on a short-term cell survival) after a 3-day exposure to MI (paclitaxel
and nocodazole). In three normal human cell types (RPE, NKE, WI-38t cells) but
not in cancer cells with mutant p53, pre-treatment with nutlin-3a, a non-genotoxic
inducer of wt p53, caused G1 and/or G2 arrest, thus preventing lethal mitotic
arrest caused by MI and allowing normal cells to recover after removal of MI.
Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, potentiated the
protective effect of nutlin-3a in normal cells. Also, a combination of rapamycin
and metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, induced G1 and G2 arrest selectively in
normal cells and thereby protected them from MI. A combination of metformin
and rapamycin also protected normal cells in low glucose conditions, whereas in
contrast it was cytotoxic for cancer cells. Based on these data and the analysis
of the literature, we suggest that a rational combination of metformin and
rapamycin can potentiate chemotherapy with mitotic inhibitors against cancer,
while protecting normal cells, thus further increasing the therapeutic window.

Introduction

How can we cause a protective G1/G2 arrest selectively in
normal cells but not in cancer cells? Whereas all normal
cells have wt p53, this tumor suppressor is mutant or lost
in 50% of cancers [10]. This absence provides a means
for selective protection of normal cells without protecting
cancer cells lacking wt p53 [11-13]. Thus, induction of
p53 can arrest cells in G1 and G2 phases, preventing their
entry into mitosis. Specifically, low concentrations of
DNA damaging drugs (DDD) induce wt p53 and arrest
cells in G1 and G2, thus protecting cells from mitotic
inhibitors [14-17]. In paired cell lines, DDD protected
cells with wt p53 but not cells lacking p53 and p21 [14].
However, the effects of DDD are poorly reversible. While
mitotic arrest and polyploidization were prevented (a
short term protection), the prospect on long-term cell
survival and recovery of proliferation remained unclear.
Also DDD can protect some cancer cell lines lacking p53
[15]. It was given consideration from the start that less

Microtubule-targeting agents or mitotic inhibitors
are one of the cornerstones of modern chemotherapy [15]. Despite different effects on microtubules and tubulin,
a variety of structures and binding sites, all microtubuleactive drugs at low concentrations kill proliferating
(cycling) cells, by causing fatal mitotic arrest [6-9]. In
addition to killing cancer cells, these mitotic inhibitors
(MI) can kill normal cycling cells (bone marrow cells, hair
follicles, mucosal and epithelial cells), thus causing certain
side effects. Side effects may not only be devastating, but
they also limit anticancer therapy. The goal is to protect
proliferating normal cells from the cytotoxicity of MI,
without protecting cancer cells.
Given that MI cannot possibly cause mitotic arrest
in the cells that do not enter mitosis, a transient G1 and/or
G2 arrest (protective arrest) must protect cells from MI.

effect of fasting may in part be due to inhibition of the
nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway in normal cells.  Fasting
decreases blood levels of nutrients (glucose, amino acids),
IGF-1 and insulin, which otherwise activate mTOR in the
organism [32-37].
Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, can in part
substitute for fasting because it decreases levels of glucose
and insulin [38, 39]. Metformin deactivates mTOR in mice
[40]. Also, metformin inhibits the mTOR pathway in cell
culture [41-43]. Both metformin and rapalogs (rapamycin
and its analogs) are clinically approved drugs. Rapalogs
are also approved for cancer therapy [44, 45]. Metformin
and rapamycin potentiate chemotherapy against cancer
[46]. Furthermore, rapalogs and metformin in combination
with chemotherapy (including MI) are undergoing clinical
trials [47-50].
Here we investigated whether nutlin-3a, rapamycin,
metformin and their combinations can protect 3 normal
cell types: WI-38t fibroblasts, RPE (retinal pigment
epithelial) and NKE (normal kidney epithelial) cells,
without protection of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
with mutant p53. We investigated whether normal cells
were fully protected and recovered upon removal MI. We
identified effective combinations of rapamycin with both

toxic and more selective drugs should be found to induce
p53 for the optimal protection of normal cells [14].
Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of Mdm2, induces wt p53
without causing DNA damage [18, 19]. Also, its effect is
strictly p53-dependent [20]. In paired and isogenic cancer
cell lines (with and without wt p53), nutlin-3a selectively
protected cells with wt p53 [16, 21, 22]. Importantly,
nutlin-3a provided a long-term protection from paclitaxel
to skin-derived fibroblast cell line in culture, so that
cells proliferated after removal of paclitaxel [21]. This
outstanding result needed to be further confirmed in other
normal cell types including epithelial cells.
Nutlin-3a is an experimental therapeutic and is not
approved yet for clinical use. Therefore, we also planned
to investigate clinically approved drugs that might protect
normal cells from MI. Cancer cells are characterized by
dysregulation of the PI-3K/mTOR pathway [23-26]. It
was hypothesized that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin may
protect normal cells from cycle-dependent chemotherapy
[27]. Although seemingly unrelated, a remarkable study
by Longo and co-workers showed that fasting protected
mice from the toxicity of chemotherapy [28-30] and,
most importantly, abrogated side effects of chemotherapy
in patients with cancer [31]. We suggest that protective

from MI.

treatment with nocodazole, cells were washed and cultured
in the fresh medium for 6 days to allow recovery of the
protected cells (Fig. 1 A). Nocodazole alone decreased
cell numbers more than 50-fold compared with control in
both MDA-MB-231 and WI-38t (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment
with nutlin-3a did not protect MDA-MB-231 cells, but
completely prevented the effects of nocodazole in WI-38t
cells (Fig. 1B). Nutlin-3 caused G1 and G2 arrest (Fig.
1C). Nocodazole arrested cells with 4N DNA content,
corresponding to mitotic arrest as evidenced by mitotic/
round cells visualized on live microscopy (Fig. 1C).
Pretreatment with nutlin-3a (Nu) completely prevented
nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 1C, Nu+Noco).
Cell cycle distributions of nutlin-pretreated cells were
almost identical with (+Noco) and without nocodazole
(Fig. 1C). Thus, G1 and G2 arrest caused by nutlin-3a
prevented mitotic arrest caused by nocodazole.
As expected, nutlin-3a induced p53 and p21 (Fig.
2A). Nocodazole alone induced p53 without inducing p21.
This is consistent with induction of p53 during prolonged
mitotic arrest [7, 51, 52]. Isolated induction of p53
(without induction of p21) by nocodazole is a consequence
of mitotic arrest [7, 52]. At both concentrations of nutlin3a (2.5 µM and 10 µM), cells were completely protected
from nocodazole: cell numbers were equal after treatment
with nutlin-3a alone and nutlin-3a plus nocodazole (Fig.
2B).

Results
Protection of WI-38t cells by nutlin-3a
To evaluate long-term protection, we determined cell
numbers six days after removal of mitotic inhibitors (MI)
such as nocodazole and paclitaxel (Fig. 1A). We initially
used nocodazole (Noco) because it is easily removable by
washing cell culture. Cells were pretreated with nutlin-3
and the next day nocodazole was added. After 3 days of

Nutlin-3a also causes reversible arrest in RPE cells,
so that cells could resume proliferation after nutlin-3a
was removed [53, 54]. We next investigated whether
this arrest can protect RPE cells from the toxicity of MI.
Pretreatment with nutlin-3a partially abrogated the toxicity
of nocodazole and paclitaxel (Taxol) in RPE cells but not
in cancer MDA-MB-231 cells with mutant p53 (Fig. 3).
The effect of paclitaxel (PTX) was less reversible than
the effect of nocodazole because PTX is poorly washable
from the cell culture.
Analysis of cell cycle distribution revealed that
nutlin-3a caused G2 arrest in RPE cells (Fig. 4). As
expected, nocodazole caused mitotic arrest, which was
indistinguishable from G2 arrest by flow cytometry, but
was evident by the appearance of mitotic cells (Fig. 4A,
microphotographs). By arresting cells in G2, nutlin-3a
prevented mitotic arrest, thus protecting normal cells. In
contrast, nutlin-3a did not cause arrest in MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, nocodazole caused mitotic
arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells both in the presence and the
absence of nutlin-3a (Fig. 4B).

was potentiated by rapamycin, which was slightly
cytoprotective by itself (Fig. 5 A). Metformin alone was
marginally protective but its effect was also potentiated by
rapamycin. A combination of metformin plus rapamycin
and a combination of nutlin-3a plus rapamycin afforded
comparable protection. Similar results were obtained in
low glucose medium (Fig. 5 B).

by rapamycin plus metformin (R+M). The combination
(R+M) caused G1/G2 arrest and this partially prevented
mitotic arrest caused by nocodazole (Fig. 7). In contrast,
R+M did not protect MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 7).
Noteworthy, the R+M combination was toxic to MDAMB-231 cells cultured at low glucose (Suppl. Fig. 2).

Protection of WI-38t by a combination of
rapamycin and metformin

We next tested whether these combinations were
protective in a third type of normal cells. Normal kidney
epithelial (NKE) cells were partially protected from
nocodazole and paclitaxel (PTX) in both normal and
low glucose media. Combinations of nutlin-3a with
rapamycin (N+R), even though rapamycin alone was not
protective, were the most effective in NKE cells (Fig. 8).
Combinations of metformin with rapamycin (R+M) were
moderately protective (Fig. 8).

Next we investigated whether a combination of
rapamycin and metformin (R+M) can protect WI-38t cells.
This combination (M + R) afforded 2-3 fold protection
in WI-38t, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Suppl. Fig.
1). Individually, 3 mM metformin and 1 nM-100 nM
rapamycin were slightly protective. Combinations of
metformin with 1 nM rapamycin were more effective (Fig.
6). We next investigated the mechanism of cytoprotection

Discussion

mg/kg) efficiently protected mice from neutropenia caused
by a mitotic inhibitor [20]. This important result indicates
that protection in cell culture is indeed applicable to the
organism.
We found that rapamycin further potentiated
the protective effect of nutlin-3a in three cell lines,
most robustly in NKE cells. There are two potential
mechanisms. First, rapamycin, as a mild cytostatic agent,
may increase the durability of arrest, thus potentiating
the protection. Second, to be protective in a long-term,
the arrest must be reversible. Nutlin-3-induced arrest is
mostly reversible in most cell lines [58, 59]. But nutlin-3a
can also induce irreversible senescence, depending on the
activity of mTOR, p53 levels and the duration of the arrest
[53, 54, 60]. Rapamycin may improve the reversibility of
arrest caused by p53 [53]. We are currently investigating
the mechanism of potentiation of nutlin-3a by rapamycin
(Leontieva et al, MS in preparation).
Since nutlin-3a does not cause arrest in cancer cells
lacking p53, the addition of rapamycin cannot possibly
potentiate nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53. Therefore,
like nutlin-3a alone, a combination of nutlin-3a plus
rapamycin (N+R) does not protect cancer cells with
mutant p53. Therefore, the combination of nutlin-3a plus
rapamycin can be used for protection of normal cells in

The goal of chemotherapeutic cyclotherapy is
selective protection of normal cells by exploiting
aberrations in cancer cell cycle such as loss of p53 [13,
55-57]. By causing G1 and G2 arrest, nutlin-3a protects
cells with wt p53 from mitotic inhibitors. As a proof of
principle in paired cell lines, nutlin-3a prevented mitotic
arrest, cell death or polyploidization (a short-term
protection) [16, 17, 21, 22]. Furthermore, pretreatment
with nutlin-3a allowed normal skin-derived fibroblasts to
recover from MI treatment, as measured by an increase
in cell numbers after 6 days (a long-term protection)
in drug-free medium [21]. Here we focused on a longterm protection and extended this observation to WI-38
fibroblasts and two epithelial cell lines: RPE and NKE.
As expected, nutlin-3a arrested normal cells in both G1
and/or G2 (depending on cell type) and thus protected
them from mitotic arrest caused by MI. While affording
a long-term protection to all 3 normal cell types, nutlin3a did not protect MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in any
experiments. Similar results in normal cell lines of
different origin indicate that nutlin-3a might also protect
relevant normal cells in the organism. Remarkably, Sur et
al demonstrated that oral administration of Nutlin-3 (200

Figure 8: Protection of NKE cells from nocodazole and paclitaxel in normal glucose and low glucose. 10,000 NKE cells were
plated in either 1g/L glucose or 0.5g/L glucose (low). Cells were pre-treated for 24 hrs with either 2.5 µM nutlin-3a, 1 and 10 nM rapamycin (R1
and R10), 3 mM metformin (M) alone or in combination and then were treated with either 200 nM nocodazole (Noco) or 50 nM Taxol (PTX).
After 3 days, cells were washed and cultured for 6 days in fresh medium before counting.

provided a long-term protection against MI in all three
normal cell types. Not only did the R+M combination not
protect cancer cells but, in contrast, it was toxic by itself
to MDA-MB-231 cells in low glucose conditions. Low
glucose levels are toxic to cancer cells, which depend on
glucose as substrates for their glycolytic phenotype [6572]. Noteworthy, metformin decreases glucose levels in
the organism.
Metformin enhances susceptibility of p53-/- cells
to apoptosis upon nutrient deprivation [73]. In contrast,
p53-proficient cells can undergo cell cycle arrest (instead
of apoptosis) in low glucose [74]. This explains selective
toxicity of metformin to p53-deficient cells in low glucose
[73, 74] observed in our study too. Thus a combination of
metformin, rapamycin and fasting may be toxic to cancer
cells, while protecting normal cells from chemotherapy
with MI (Fig. 9), thus increasing therapeutic window.
Concentrations of metformin (1 mM) and rapamycin
(1 nM) are lower than those achievable in patients
[75-80]. We suggest that metformin and rapamycin
should be administrated for a 1-2-day period prior and
simultaneously with MI such as the Vinca drugs and
Taxanes (Fig. 10). In conclusion, based on cell culture data
and analysis of the literature, we suggest that nutlin-3a,
nutlin-3a plus rapamycin and rapamycin plus metformin
may extend the therapeutic window of microtubule-active
chemotherapy. Low concentrations of rapamycin and
metformin, especially combined with fasting, may be
used in the clinic today.

patients having tumors with mutant p53. In heterogeneous
tumors with co-existing cells having wt and mutant p53,
the N+R combination may spare cancer cells with wt p53.
This will revert the tumor to a less aggressive phenotype,
which is more sensitive to conventional chemotherapy.
Therefore, a combination of N+R+MI may be promising
in heterogeneous cancers too.
It was shown that fasting, which decreases
levels of glucose and insulin and inactivates nutrientsensing signaling pathways, decreases side-effects of
chemotherapy [29]. Like fasting, metformin, an antidiabetic drug, decreases glucose levels. Also, metformin
lowers levels of insulin in women with early breast cancer
[38]. Furthermore, metformin decreases tumor growth
in mice fed by high-calorie diet [61, 62]. Metformin and
rapamycin differently affects nutrient-sensing pathways
[63]. Therefore, 2 drugs may in theory potentiate each
other. A combination of temsirolimus (an analog of
rapamycin) and metformin showed promising results in
phase I clinical trial as cancer therapy [43, 64].
Here we demonstrated that a combination of
rapamycin and metformin (R+M) caused protective G1 and
G2 arrest in normal cells. Furthermore, this combination
