ABSTRACT:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by the accumulation of
clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite extensive efforts to design drugs
targeting tumoral cells and their microenvironment, MM remains an incurable
disease for which new therapeutic strategies are needed. We demonstrated here
that antiestrogens (AEs) belonging to selective estrogen receptor modulators family
induce a caspase-dependent apoptosis and trigger a protective autophagy. Autophagy
was recognized by monodansylcadaverin staining, detection of autophagosomes by
electronic microscopy, and detection of the cleaved form of the microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3. Moreover, autophagy was inhibited by drugs such as bafilomycin
A1 and 3-methyladenosine. Autophagy was mediated by the binding of AEs to a
class of receptors called the antiestrogen binding site (AEBS) different from the
classical estrogen nuclear receptors. The binding of specific ligands to the AEBS was
accompanied by alteration of cholesterol metabolism and in particular accumulation
of sterols: zymostenol or desmosterol depending on the ligand. This was due to
the inhibition of the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase activity borne by the AEBS.
We further showed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin pathway mediated autophagy signaling. Moreover, AEBS ligands restored
sensitivity to dexamethasone in resistant MM cells. Since we showed previously that
AEs arrest MM tumor growth in xenografted mice, we propose that AEBS ligands may
have a potent antimyeloma activity alone or in combination with drugs used in clinic.

INTRODUCTION

both myeloma cells and their bone marrow environment
[2]. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
and selective estrogen receptors disruptors (SERDs) or
pure antiestrogens (AEs) may provide a potent strategy
in myeloma therapy. Indeed, several groups, including
our, have previously reported that SERMs and SERDs
inhibited cell proliferation and/or induced apoptosis of
MM cells [3-7]. Although myeloma cells express estrogen
receptors (ER) belonging to both α and β isotypes [4,

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy
characterized by the accumulation of clonal tumoral
plasma cells in the bone marrow. The accumulation of
malignant cells that synthesize immunoglobulins causes
hyperproteinemia, renal dysfunction, bone lesions
and immunodeficiency [1]. This disease still remains
incurable despite novel therapeutic approaches targeting

The activity of ChEH was measured on intact cells. Cells were incubated with [14C]-5,6-EC (0.6 µM, 20 µCi/µmol)
and were treated with increasing concentrations of drugs ranging from 1 nM to 10 µM over 24 h. IC50 represents the
concentration of drugs required to inhibit 50% of ChEH activity. Cells were treated with 10 µM Tam, 10 µM OHT, 40
µM PBPE, 10 µM RU 39411 or 10 µM RU 58668 in the presence (+) or in the absence (-) of 500 µM Vit E for 48 h. Cells
were analyzed by electron microscopy for the presence of multilamellar bodies (MLBs), autophagic vesicles (AVs), and
unilamellar vesicles (UVs). About 100 cells per grid were observed for each condition. The sign + means that 80 % cells
were positive and contained at least 5 vesicles otherwise they were considered as negative (-). The presence of 5,6-EC in
cells was determined by GC/MS as described in the Methods section.

5], it is not clear if AEs signal through canonical ERs.
Nevertheless, in vivo experiments with xenografted
mice bearing MM tumors clearly demonstrated that the
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT) as well as the pure AE, RU
58668 block tumor growth [8, 9]. This strongly supports
that SERMs and SERDs may provide an alternative
therapy for MM patients.
Tamoxifen (Tam) and its active metabolite, OHT
are the prototypes of SERMs. They are high affinity
ligands for nuclear ERs but also for other targets
that can account for their biological activities [10].
Among them, is the microsomal antiestrogen binding
site (AEBS) [11]. The AEBS results from heterodimerization of 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8-Δ7-isomerase and
3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ7-reductase both involved in the
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [11]. In addition, the
AEBS carries out cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase
(ChEH) activity [12]. ChEH catalyzes the transhydration
of 5,6α-epoxy-cholesterol (5,6α-EC) and 5,6β-epoxycholesterol (5,6β-EC) into cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol
(CT) [13]. The AEBS/ChEH binds various structural
classes of ligands: SERMs, several σ receptor ligands,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

polyunsaturated fatty acids and ring B oxysterols but
neither estrogens nor the SERDs such as RU 58688 and
fulvestrant [13]. We have previously reported that AEBSbinding by Tam or OHT induces MCF7 breast cancer (BC)
cell apoptosis and autophagy through the alteration of
cholesterol metabolism [14]. Indeed, cholesterol precursors
(5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol, zymostenol and 5α-cholest5,24-dien-3β-ol, desmosterol for tamoxifen and OHT
treatments, respectively) accumulate in SERM-treated
cells as the consequence of inhibition of cholesterogenic
enzymes involved in ChEH/AEBS activity. We report
here that: a) OHT induces apoptosis and autophagy in
human multiple myeloma cell lines (HMCLs); b) OHTtreatment leads to the accumulation of free sterols in
HMCLs due to the inhibition of the catalytic activity of
the AEBS subunits and ChEH activity; c) AEBS ligands
are responsible for cholesterol metabolism alteration in
HMCLs and induction of autophagy. Taken in concert with
in vivo activity of OHT [8], our data support a therapeutic
potential of OHT and more generally AEBS ligands for
antimyeloma therapy.

μM for 72 h), indicating that cells underwent apoptosis.
We confirmed the induction of apoptosis in OHT-treated
cells by a double annexin V/propidium iodide staining
and cytometry sorting (data not shown). When triggered,
the OHT-induced apoptosis proceeded through the
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This was associated
with activation of upstream/downstream caspases [5],
downregulation or cleavage of anti-apoptotic BCL2
family members (data not shown), loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm, Figure 1B), and, finally,
cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [5]. However,
when the caspase 3 inhibitor Q-VD-OPh was used in
combination with OHT in HMCLs, we observed only a
partial restoration of cell viability (Figure 1C). Our data
suggest that another programmed cell death pathway,
independent of caspases, was active in AE-treated
HMCLs. Since autophagy was recognized as a regulator
of both cell viability and death in MM [15], we looked for
markers of autophagy in AE-treated cells.

OHT triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in
HMCLs
We have previously reported that AEs belonging to
both SERD and SERM classes display anti-proliferative
and/or pro-apoptotic properties on MM cell lines and
primary cells [5, 7]; these effects are dependent on AEs and
cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). Roughly, OHT induces
both G1 arrest and apoptosis in responsive HMCLs, while
pure AEs such as RU 58668 and fulvestrant induce either
G1 arrest or apoptosis, suggesting that each AE subtype
does not affect identical pathways. We focused here on
the biological effects of OHT in responsive HMCLs. As
exemplified Figure 1A, APO2.7-positive RPMI 8226
and LP-1 cells were recognized after OHT treatment (10

OHT induces autophagy in HMCLs

characteristic of autophagosomes and autolysosomes
(Supplementary Figure 1). In sharp contrast, vehicletreated cells lacked MLBs and autophagosomes
(Supplementary Figure 1). The examination of cells at
high magnification allowed us to notice that unilamellar
vesicles (UVs) were present in OHT-treated HMCLs
(Supplementary Figure 1, Table 1) suggesting an alteration
of lipid metabolism. Microtubule-associated protein light
chain 3 (LC3) is translocated to autophagosomes after
lipidation and cleavage (LC3-I to LC3-II) at the onset
of autophagy [17]. Indirect immunofluorescence was
used for monitoring this phenomenon. As shown Figure
2B, OHT-treatment induced the translocation of LC3 to
autophagosomes recognized by the appearance of green
dots in both HMCLs. Moreover, OHT-treatment triggered
the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II, the latter being
increased by a bafilomycin A1 (BAF A1) treatment as
observed by immunoblotting (Figure 2C), evidencing
that OHT induced an autophagic flux. We next showed

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred as autophagy)
is characterized by the appearance of acidic vesicles
that could be stained with monodansylcadaverin (MDC)
and observed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown
Figure 2A, OHT-treatment (10 μM for 24 h) caused the
appearance of MDC-stained vesicles in HMCLs. We next
analyzed the ultrastructural morphology of treated cells. In
both cell lines, OHT-treatment (10 μM for 24 h) induced
mitochondria alterations and condensation of chromatin
confirming that the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
was triggered (Supplementary Figure 1). Autophagy
is often accompanied by a massive cytoplasmic
vacuolization that indicates increased autophagic flux
[16]. Accordingly, OHT-treatment caused the formation
of intracytoplasmic vesicles such as multilamellar bodies
(MLBs), vacuoles surrounded by a double-membrane

Figure 3: OHT and AEBS ligands induce the accumulation of cholesterol precursors in HMCLs. A) RPMI 8226 and LP-1

cells were treated with EtOH or OHT (10 μM) for 48 h and cytospinned. Slides were stained with filipin and analyzed. Cells containing free
sterols are colored in blue. Cells were visualized in the ultraviolet range using a x40 objective on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Göettingen,
Germany). B) The sterols accumulated in RPMI 8226 and LP-1 cells after 48 h incubation with SERMs, SERDs and selective AEBS/
ChEH ligands were determined and quantified. Analyses were performed by HPLC and GC/MS as described in the Methods section.
The cholesterol intermediates were quantified as a percent by the weight of total sterol. The amount of zymostenol and desmosterol was
quantified by references to an external standard. C) HMCLs were treated with EtOH, OHT (10 μM), Tam (10 μM), RU 58668 (10 μM) or
PBPE (40 μM) for 24 h and incubated with 0.6 μM [14C]-EC for 48 h and ChEH activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of CE
into CT by TLC. A representative autoradiogram from three independent experiments is shown. D) RPMI 8226 and LP-1 cells were preincubated with 500 µM Vit E, 1 mM NAC, 50 nM BAF A1 or 10 mM 3-MA and then challenged with OHT (10 μM) or PBPE (40 µM) for
72 h. Cell death was determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Data were expressed as the percentage of cell death relative to control cells that
received OHT (10 μM) or PBPE (40 µM). Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate with comparable results. The data presented
here are the means ± SEM of all experiments. *, p<0.001.

that OHT stimulated the rate of long-lived protein
degradation in both cell lines confirming the induction
of autophagy (Figure 2D). Although a significant degree
of basal autophagy was present in HMCLs (Figure 2C,
Supplementary Figure 1), in agreement with a previous
report [15], our data establish unambiguously that OHT
induces an autophagic process.

3B). Free sterols accumulated also in HMCLs treated
with OHT and AEBS ligands (Supplementary Figure 2).
Tam and PBPE induced the accumulation zymostenol,
OHT and RU 39411 induced the accumulation of
desmosterol and, as expected, RU 58668 did not induce
free sterol accumulation (Figure 3B). Moreover, OHT
and PBPE induced the accumulation of sphingomyelin,
which was correlative with the increase of cellular free
sterols (Supplementary Figure 2). Altogether, these data
established that MLBs content found in HMCLs is similar
to that found in BC cells [14]. Neutral lipids analyses
showed that OHT and PBPE treatments induced the
accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG) in cells explaining
the presence of UVs (Supplementary Figure 2). We
recently reported that TG biosynthesis and accumulation
was mainly due to the inhibition of ChEH carried out by
the AEBS, which led also to the accumulation of 5,6-ECs
[18]. We next evaluated the activity of the ChEH enzyme
and firstly verified that ChEH activity was measurable in
each cell line. As shown Figure 3C, 5,6-EC accumulated
in OHT-, PBPE- and Tam-treated cells indicating that
ChEH activity was inhibited by these drugs. By contrast,

OHT and AEBS ligands compromise cholesterol
metabolism in HMCLs
The presence of MLBs and UVs in OHT-treated
cells could reflect an increasing mass of free sterols and
lipids in OHT-treated cells. Detection of free sterols in
HMCLs was achieved using filipin labeling. As shown
Figure 3A, perinuclear vesicles were stained by filipin
in OHT- but not in EtOH- or RU 58668-treated cells. As
previously described for BC cells [12], we confirmed that
Tam, OHT, benzylphenoxy-ethyl-pyrrolidin (PBPE) and
RU 39411 bind to the AEBS with high affinity in HMCLs
while RU 58668 had no measurable affinity (Figure

its activation product, CT accumulated in EtOH- and
RU 58668-treated cells (Figure 3C). We found that,
in HMCLs, AEBS ligands inhibited ChEH in a dosedependent fashion with submicromolar concentrations of
IC50 except for RU 58668 which did not inhibit ChEH up
to 10 µM (Table 1).

did not protect cells (Figure 3D). Since the inhibitors of
autophagy (BAF A1 and 3-MA) increased the cytotoxicity
of drugs, autophagy seemed a survival process in HMCLs.
As a whole, AEBS ligands belonging to various structural
classes (diphenyl-methane compounds, SERMs) induce
similar effects on cholesterol metabolism and autophagy
in HMCLs.

AEBS ligands induce a protective autophagy in
HCMLs

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway controls AEBSinduced autophagy

As OHT, PBPE stimulated the rate of long-lived
protein degradation in both cell lines. This stimulation
was inhibited by a co-treatment with 3-methyladenosine
(3-MA), a well-known inhibitor of autophagy (Figure
2D). Moreover, we observed the characteristics of
autophagy in RU 39411- or PBPE-treated cells (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 3A). Although more subtle
than for OHT, RU 39411 and PBPE treatments caused
the formation of UVs, MLBs and autophagosomes
(Table 1). The co-treatment of HCMLs with vitamin E
(Vit E), a lipophilic antioxidant inhibited the formation
of UV further confirming the role of sterol oxidation in
the triggering of autophagy (Table 1). We previously
observed in BC cells, that Vit E inhibited the specific
stimulation of 5,6-EC production and TG biosynthesis by
AEBS ligands while it had no impact on autophagosomes
production or MLBs accumulation [12, 18]. We reported
here that the co-treatment of HMCLs with AEBS ligands
and Vit E induced a similar effect in RPMI 8226 and
LP-1 cells strongly suggesting a similar mechanism
(Table 1). Moreover, Vit E blocked the induction of cell
death by AEBS ligands while NAC another antioxidant

We next focused on the effects of the highly
specific AEBS ligands, RU 39411 and PBPE and verified
that they were capable of inducing a cell death that was
strictly caspase-independent (Supplementary Figure
3B). The PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis is the master negative
regulator of autophagy in various cell systems including
MM, although constitutively activated in those cells [1922]. To ensure that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was
recruited after AEBS ligand treatment, we used specific
PI3K and mTOR inhibitors in combination with RU
39411 and PBPE. As shown Figure 4B, and in agreement
with the known effects of PI3K inhibitors as inducers of
apoptosis in HMCLs [23], LY 294002 induced cell death.
Importantly, LY 294002 co-operated with RU 39411
and PBPE to enhance cell death. We concluded that LY
294002 triggered apoptosis and simultaneously, RU 39411
and PBPE induced autophagy through parallel pathways
in both cell lines. The effect of everolimus was obviously
different. Such as rapamycin another inhibitor of mTOR,
everolimus induced cell death (Figure 4C). However,
there was no clear additive effect of everolimus (even
statistically significant for some combinations) when
associated with AEBS ligands (Figure 4C). Our data
suggest that everolimus and RU 39411/PBPE used similar
or overlapping pathways to conduct to cell death/survival.

Treatment of MM cells with AEBS ligands
bypasses resistance to dexamethasone

Dexamethasone is widely used in clinical protocols
for MM [2]. Interestingly, RPMI 8226 and LP-1 cells
are both resistant to dexamethasone. To determine if the
triggering of autophagy could restore sensitivity, RU
39411 was used to prime autophagy then dexamethasone
was added to cultured HCMLs. The response was then
evaluated by MTT assay as before. As shown Figure 5,
the triggering of autophagy by RU 39411 restores the
sensitivity of both cell lines to dexamethasone.

DISCUSSION
Tamoxifen is the prototypical AE clinically used
since more than 30 years for endocrine therapy and
chemoprevention of ERα-positive breast cancers [24, 25].

Like its active metabolite OHT, Tam and a plethora of
other SERMs bind to ER and inhibit tumor growth via
gene transcription and non-genomic ER activities. They
also affect other intracellular targets such as the AEBS/
ChEH [26]. SERMs inhibit the growth of HMCLs and
induce their apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial
pathway [5]. In the present work, we provide evidences for
the induction of a sterol-dependent protective autophagy
by several AEBS ligands. Similarly to what we reported
for ERα-positive BC cells, we found that this activity
proceeds through alteration of cholesterol metabolism
[14].
MM cells synthesize large amounts of
immunoglobulins and activate the unfolded protein
response (UPR) pathway. Autophagy is a protective
process by which malignant MM cells protect
themselves from unfolded or misfolded proteins [15] and
compromising the UPR cascade induces an autophagic
cell death in MM cells [27]. Moreover, targeting
autophagy in MM sensitizes cells to various drugs such
as new proteasome inhibitors [28], nucleoside analogue
[29], HSP90 inhibitors [20], and DNA-damaging agents
[30]. Targeting autophagy has been proposed for fighting
myeloma [31]. As a whole, constitutive autophagy is
a survival mechanism for MM cells although excessive
autophagy, induced by several stresses including drugs, is a
mechanism of cell death. We show here that AEBS ligands
such as OHT, Tam, RU 39411 and PBPE are able to induce
a protective autophagy in MM cells through a mechanism
similar to what was found in BC cells. We observed
that AEBS ligands, including Tam and OHT, induced a
caspase-independent cell death through a mechanism that
required the production and the accumulation of 5,6-EC
[14, 18, 32]. Interestingly, we observed the same response
in the two HMCLs we used, despite their opposite RAS
status (mutated for RPMI 8226 and wild-type for LP-1,
[33]) and their belonging to different prognostic groups
according to the UAMS classification [34]. Importantly,
the activation of autophagy alleviates resistance to
dexamethasone. Our data support the notion of autophagy
as a survival mechanism in MM cells. Moreover, AEBS
ligands alone or in combination with dexamethasone could
represent a useful anti-myeloma therapy.
Metabolic alterations are hallmarks of cancer
including MM, and participate in the resistance towards
apoptosis inducers. It has been shown that targeting
glucose metabolism induces autophagy and markedly
enhances cell death in HMCLs [29]. Our study establishes
that altering cholesterol metabolism is a mean to induce
cell death and to restore sensitivity in HMCLs. Indeed,
AEBS ligands inhibit post-lanosterol cholesterol enzymes,
further conducting cells to accumulate cholesterol
precursors and sphingomyelin leading to MLB formation
and to autophagy. We have described the same features for
BC cells [18]. Nonetheless, in BC cells, Tam induces cell
death through a mechanism of differentiation driven by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 5,6EC production. Although, the inhibition of lipid oxidation
enhanced AEBS-mediated cell death in HMCLs, no
differentiation process could occur, HMCLs being at the
last step of differentiation [35]. In BC cells, accumulation
of 5,6-ECs (5,6α-EC and 5,6β-EC) contributes to
cytotoxic, antiproliferative and chemopreventive effects
of ChEH inhibitors [36]. Moreover, 5,6 α-EC is an
endogenous ligand for the liver X receptors (LXR) α
and β [37] and LXRs participate in cholesterol transport
and metabolism as well as the regulation of tumor cell
growth [38]. Although not analyzed in the present study,
LXRβ are known to be overexpressed in MM cells [39].
Moreover, in good agreement with previous study [18],
TG was produced in response to the accumulation of
5,6-EC after AEBS ligand treatment. We can therefore
hypothesize that LXRβ are stimulated by the AEBS in
HMCLs. In another hand, we found that 5,6β-EC was
responsible of a mitochondrial cytotoxicity in BC cells and
that overexpression of BCL2 protected cells against the
cytotoxicity induced by 5,6β-EC as well as SERMs and
selective AEBS ligands [18]. Although, the antiapoptotic
protein BCL2 is overexpressed in MM, RPMI 8226 and
LP-1 cells respond to AEBS ligands.
MM cells are particularly armed to counteract
various stresses. In turn, the inhibition of proteasome
degradation, aggresome formation, heat shock proteins
accumulation or UPR pathway leads to autophagy [15,
19-22]. It is tempting to speculate that the accumulation
of UVs, MLBs and free cholesterol in MM cells could
be sufficient to induce an autophagic response and that
the level of this response governs survival or death.
Alteration of cholesterol trafficking, accumulation of
free sterol and formation of MLBs lead to autophagymediated neurodegeneration in the Niemann-Pick type
C disease [40, 41]. Lipophagy has been described as an
alternative pathway of lipid metabolism [42]. In this form
of metabolism, cholesterol is taken up by autophagosomes
and delivered to lysosome degradation. Impaired
lipophagy could sensitize MM cells to death stimuli.
Besides the well-known role of mTOR in the
inhibition of autophagy, an emerging role is the control
of lipid metabolism and storage [43, 44]. However, the
signaling routes for both effects are still poorly defined.
Our data could suggest that the control by mTOR of both
autophagy and cholesterol metabolism are affected by
AEBS ligands in HMCLs. Further efforts are needed to
characterize their downstream effectors within the mTOR
pathway(s). This may conduct to discover new targets
potentially involved in the treatment of myeloma but
also in other malignancies in which lipid metabolism is
deregulated such as diabetes and obesity.

METHODS

Dylight™488 anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland) as previously
described [14]. Incubation with AbII alone served as
negative control. Slides were mounted and analyzed with
the Fluoview FV 1000 confocal microscope and Fluoview
Viewer software (Olympus, Rungis, France). The detection
of autophagic vacuoles was done by MDC staining as
previously described [14]. Filipin staining was done by
incubating glass slides for 1 h at room temperature with 50
μg/ml filipin in PBS solution as described [14]. Staining
was visualized using a Nikon eclipse 90i.

Chemicals
4-[(Z)-1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethyloxy)phenyl]2-phenyl]-1-but-1-enyl]-phenol or OHT and [quinoylvalyl-O-methylaspartyl-(2,6-difluoro-phenoxy)-methyl
ketone] (Q-VD-OPh), BAF A1, MDC, filipin, everolimus
(or RAD-001), LY 294002, dexamethasone, Vit E or
α-tocopherol, NAC, 3-MA and oxysterols were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France).
[14C]-labelled 5,6-EC and CT were synthesized as reported
before [18]. 17β-11-[4-[5-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfonyl]-pentyloxy]-phenyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene,3,17diol or RU 58668 and 11β-(4-(2-(dimethylamino)-ethoxy)phenyl)estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol or RU 39441
were gifts of P Van de Velde (Sanofi, Paris, France).
Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) was obtained from AstraZeneca
(Macclesfield, UK). 1-(2-(4-benzylphenoxy)-ethyl)pyrrolidin-HCl (PBPE) was synthesized as described
[45]. Chemical structures of drugs are presented in
Supplementary Figure 4.

Apoptosis determination by APO2.7 staining and
cytometry sorting
HMCLs exposed to vehicle (ethanol, EtOH) or
OHT (10 μM for 24-72 h) were stained with Apo 2.7 PEconjugated Ab (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France).
APO2.7-stained HMCLs were analyzed by flow cytometry
(Gallios, Beckman Coulter) and data were processed with
the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter). On average, 2
x 104 cells were analyzed for each culture condition, for
each experiment.

RPMI 8226 were obtained from R Bataille (CLCC,
Nantes, France) and LP-1 cells from D Bouscary (Institut
Cochin, Paris, France). At their arrival, the identity of
cells was checked by karyotyping and surface markers
expression; cells were then amplified and frozen. HMCLs
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine
(Lonza) and 10% FCS (fetal calf serum) (PAA
Laboratories, Velizy-Villacoublay, France). In experiments
with AEs, cells were cultured in phenol red-free medium
plus FCS. AEs were dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) to obtain
10 mM stock solution and then diluted into medium
immediately before use. For controls, vehicle was added at
the same final concentration. Cell viability was determined
using CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution (MTT
[(3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay, Promega, Charbonnières, France)
according to the supplier’s instructions.

Transmission electronic microscopy analysis
HMCLs were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1
M Sorensen phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and post-fixed with
1% OsO4 in the same buffer. Cells were then dehydrated
through a graded ethanol series, embedded in Epon 812

The degradation of long-lived proteins was
measured as described previously [46]. Briefly, HMCLs
were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with 0.2 µCi/ml of
L-[14C]valine in complete medium. Cells were then
washed resuspended in medium with no nutrients but
supplemented with 10 mM valine. After the first h of
incubation, the chase medium was replaced by complete
medium and the incubation continued for 5 h. When
required drugs (10 µM OHT, 40 µM PBPE or 10 mM
3-MA) were added to the chase medium. Radiolabeled
proteins present in the chase medium as well as in cells
were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) at
4°C. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting.
The rate of protein degradation was calculated from the
ratio of radioactivity in the medium to that of precipitated
cell fraction.
