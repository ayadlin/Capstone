Proton radiotherapy is becoming more common since protons induce more precise DNA damage
at the tumor site with reduced side effects to adjacent normal tissues. However, the long-term
biological effects of proton irradiation in cancer initiation compared to conventional photon
irradiation are poorly characterized. In this study, using a human familial adenomatous polyposis
syndrome susceptible mouse model, we show that whole body irradiation with protons are more
effective in inducing senescence-associated inflammatory responses (SIR) which are involved in
colon cancer initiation and progression. After proton irradiation, a subset of SIR genes (Troy,
Sox17, Opg, Faim2, Lpo, Tlr2 and Ptges) and a gene known to be involved in invasiveness (Plat),
along with the senescence associated gene (P19Arf) are markedly increased. Following these
changes loss of Casein kinase Iα (CKIα) and induction of chronic DNA damage and TP53
mutations are increased compared to x-ray irradiation. Proton irradiation also increases the number
of colonic polyps, carcinomas and invasive adenocarcinomas. Pretreatment with the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug, CDDO-EA, reduces proton irradiation associated SIR and tumorigenesis.
Thus, exposure to proton irradiation elicits significant changes in colorectal cancer initiation and
progression that can be mitigated using CDDO-EA.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Charged particles, such as protons and heavy ions, lose energy by continuous interactions
with electrons, and through occasional nuclear events within the absorbing materials (1).
Thus, unlike photons, such as x-ray and γ-ray, which are absorbed by exponential
attenuation, charged particles have a finite range and deposit energy in an inverse
relationship with their velocity (1). Proton radiation produces a rapid fall-off of absorbed
dose at the distal stopping edge, and a low level of lateral scatter, which results in sharp
lateral beam edges (Bragg peak) (1–4). Proton therapy generally uses an energy range
between 60 to 250 MeV/n so that tumors seated at 3 cm to 30 cm depth can be treated (5).
For this reason, cancer radiotherapy treatments using protons has become much more
common worldwide. However, the long-term risk and biological effects of protons in normal
tissues remain to be more fully characterized.

Risk assessment is usually determined by the relative biologic effectiveness of various
parameters for proton particles compared to photon (e.g. x-rays or γ-rays) exposures. Photon
radiation risk estimates have been used to extrapolate to proton radiation but the reliability
of the models for relative biologic effectiveness determination has uncertainties (6–7). High
energy (250 MeV/n) protons have been found to have a similar biologic effectiveness to γrays for incidence of both simple chromosome damage and complex chromosome exchanges
in human lymphocytes when irradiated with a high dose-rate (70 cGy/min) (8). However,
protons increase chromosome damages in human lymphocytes when they are delivered at a
lower dose-rate (0.125 cGy/min) compared to low dose-rate of γ-rays exposure (8). While a
low dose-rate of protons increases chromosomal damage in vitro, cytogenetic effects of
mouse bone marrow cells exposed to protons or γ-rays (both delivered at 1 cGy/min) are
similar in vivo (9). While the application of scaling factors is generally accepted to be the
only practical approach to human cancer risk estimation for protons, a testable hypothesis is
that qualitative and quantitative differences between proton and photon effects are
maintained across species, such as from mouse to human. Understanding how to scale such
risks in model systems will provide the best possible framework for undertaking the same
scaling of risks in humans. In order to use this approach, collection of relevant quantitative
data for oncogenic and pre-oncogenic endpoints in “relevant” animal model systems are
needed. In addition, little is known about the comparative molecular mechanisms involved in
charged particle-induced carcinogenic pathways (10–12).
The gastrointestinal track is one of the highly sensitive tissues to radiation-induced damage,
and colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in much of the industrialized
world (13). Apc mutations play a critical initiating role in adenoma development in the
inherited setting of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome and in sporadic tumor
development (13). Mice carrying the ApcMin (Multiple intestinal neoplasia) mutation which have a

nonsense mutation at codon 850 of the Apc gene appears to be responsible for predisposition
to the development of multiple intestinal tumors in a mouse genetic model (14). The ApcMin
mouse develops ~50 adenomas and infrequent carcinomas in the small intestine and usually
die by 140 days of age. Because the vast majority of gastrointestinal tumors in human FAP
patients are developed in the distal colon and rectum instead of small intestine, the ApcMin
mouse has notable limitations as a model for human colorectal carcinogenesis. Thus,
conditional transgenic mice in which Apc has been targeted for somatic inactivation by Cre
recombinase under the control of CDX2 homeobox gene promoter (CPC;Apc mouse) has
been developed (15). CPC;Apc mice developed adenomas and carcinomas mainly in the
distal colon and rectum. In addition, morphologic and molecular studies of the mouse
tumors reveal a striking similarity to human colorectal tumors (15).

Exposure to ionizing radiation induces intrinsic DNA damage and cellular senescence
responses in human normal epithelial cells and normal fibroblasts (16). Intrinsic DNA
damage and cellular senescence have recently been implicated as a major barrier against
tumor initiation and progression (17–18). While senescence may initially impede tumor
progression, opposing functions of senescence in tumorigenesis have also been studied.
Accordingly, senescent cells secret cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which can
facilitate tumor cell growth (19). Casein kinase I alpha (CKIα) plays a role in the Wnt
signaling pathway. Ablation of CKIα triggers extensive Wnt hyper-induction and low-grade
senescence-associated inflammatory responses (SIR) in the mouse intestine but homeostasis
is still maintained along with wild-type p53 activity (17, 20). However, with additional
alterations, such as mutations in p53, SIR loses its growth control capacity and leads to
accelerated tumorigenesis and invasiveness in colorectal cancer along with overexpression of
a set of invasiveness genes (termed the p53-suppressed invasiveness signature, PSIS) (17,
20). In this study, we characterized the biological effects of low dose-rate proton exposures
(e.g. similar to solar particle event (SPE) simulations, sSPE) using the CPC;Apc mouse as
compared to higher dose-rate protons and photon exposure. To elucidate the mechanism of
low dose rate proton-induced increases in the tumor initiation and progression, the parainflammation driving gastrointestinal track homeostasis/tumorigenesis model (17) was
examined. Since protons with an energy range between 60 to 250 MeV/n (human therapeutic
range) completely penetrate through a much smaller mouse body, in the present studies we
used 50 MeV/n proton (which has ~2 cm of Bragg peak region). This energy would be
predicted to deposit most of the energy inside a mouse, simulating what might be occurring
in human patients treated with slightly higher dose rates of proton therapy.

Low Dose-Rate Simulated Solar Particle Event (sSPE) Exposure Reduces Lifespan and
Crypt Number in Wild Type Mice
While exposure to 2 Gy acute protons (50 MeV/n) with high dose-rate (20 cGy/min) did not
change the lifespan of wild type C57BL6/J mice compared to unirradiated control mice, 2
Gy protons (SPE simulation, sSPE) with low dose-rate (1.67 cGy/min) caused markedly
decreased lifespan relative to acute proton radiation. The median survival of the unirradiated
control and acute proton groups were 763 day (n=30) and 769 day (n=12), respectively. In

contrast, the sSPE irradiated mice showed significantly shortened median survival of 602
day (n=20) (Figure 1A). When colon histology was examined at the time of death in wild
type mice, neither hyperplasias nor polyps were detected in both acute proton and sSPE
irradiated mice (data not shown). However, a significant decrease in the crypt number in
sSPE irradiated wild type mice compared to unirradiated or acute proton irradiated groups
was observed (Figure 1B). The mean difference of crypt number per field (10×
magnification) between unirradiated control and sSPE was 3.9±1.1 SD (standard deviation)
(p=0.002, n=12), and the difference between acute proton and sSPE was 5.0±1.2 SD
(p=0.0004, n=12) (Figure 1C).
Low dose-rate sSPE Exposure Induces Higher Colonic Tumorigenesis Compared to
Acute Proton or X-ray in Colon Cancer Susceptible CPC;Apc Mice

To determine the effects of proton exposure in a colon cancer susceptible mouse model,
CPC;Apc mice were exposed to 2 Gy of x-ray (photon irradiation), acute high dose-rate
protons, or low dose-rate protons (sSPE) radiation. While median survival of unirradiated
wild type mice was calculated as 763 day, the median survival of unirradiated and sSPE
exposed to colon cancer susceptible CPC;Apc mice was 351 day (n=76) and 327 day (n=71)
respectively. Exposure to sSPE caused a slight decrease in median lifespan (p=0.032 in
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test) in CPC;Apc mice but similar maximum lifespan was
observed compared to the unirradiated control group (Figure 2A). Compared to sSPEirradiated mice, similar survival curves were observed with acute protons (n=30) and x-ray
(n=25) exposure (Figure 2B). To investigate the effects of acute proton or sSPE proton
irradiation in colonic tumorigenesis, CPC;Apc mice (n=6 per study group) were observed 50
days post irradiation. However, no significant difference was observed in tumor initiation or
progression at this time point post-irradiation (Figure 2D). However, 100 days after
irradiation, the average number of polyps in the unirradiated control group was 3.2±1.3 SD
(standard deviation), the number of polyps in 2 Gy x-ray, acute proton and sSPE-irradiated
mice was 4.4±3.1 SD, 4.6±1.3 SD, and 7.2±1.1 SD respectively (Figure 2C–D). To
determine if mice could be protected from sSPE-induced damage with the radioprotector,
CDDO-EA (a synthetic triterpenoid) (21–25), groups of mice were fed a diet containing
CDDO-EA (400 mg/kg diet) for 3 days continuously prior to sSPE exposure. Tumorigenesis
of CDDO-EA treatment mice was significantly reduced to unirradiated control levels
(3.0±1.0 SD) 100 days after sSPE exposure (Figure 2C–D).

In the segmental distribution of tumors 100 days after irradiation, unirradiated control mice
showed colon tumors mostly in the distal region (68.9%) compared to the middle region
(31.1%) with no tumors in the proximal region. While a significant difference was not
detected in the segmental distribution of colon tumors in the x-ray and acute proton exposed
group compared to the unexposed control, exposure to sSPE radiation showed higher
tumorigenesis in the middle colon (38.9%) with 2.8% tumors in the proximal region (Figure
2E). When colonic tumors in each group were categorized into two groups depending on
their size, there were higher numbers of larger tumors (> 2 mm) in irradiated mice relative to
unirradiated control mice but there were no significant differences tumor sizes between
acute proton and sSPE exposure (Figure 2F).

Histopathological analysis of the colon tumors was performed at the biological end-point
and showed that 25.8% (n=62) of mice exposed to 2 Gy sSPE showed invasive
adenocarcinoma. In contrast, only 6.3% (n=48) of unirradiated mice developed invasive
adenocarcinoma. 2 Gy x-ray and acute proton exposed mice showed 8.0% (n=25) and 11.1%
(n=27) of invasive adenocarcinoma incidence respectively. Pretreatment of CDDO-EA prior
to sSPE exposure markedly decreased the incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma from 25.8%
to 15.2% (n=33) (Table 1). Representative images of the invasive foci penetrating through
the muscularis mucosa are shown in Figure 2G.
Exposure to sSPE Results in an Increased Incidence of Higher-grade Colorectal
Adenocarcinomas

Human colorectal cancer can be classified by pit’s morphology through histopathological
analysis (26). While round shape pits are observed in most normal colon tissues, tubular,
roundish or branch-like pits are mainly found in adenomas. High grade adenocarcinomas
show non-structured pit shapes (26). In addition, to better classify adenocarcinomas,
immunohistochemistry of cyclin D1 was performed since others have reported a significant
correlation between cyclin D1 expression and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients
(27). Strong expression of cyclin D1 is observed in large and invasive carcinomas, and
correlate with poor survival (27). In this study, we observed strong positive staining of cyclin
D1 in highly progressed adenocarcinomas which had non-structured pits (Figure 3A). When
colon sections collected 100 days after irradiation were scored by pit shape, exposure to
sSPE radiation showed a markedly higher incidence of non-structured pit tumors (39.5%,
p<0.05) relative to unirradiated (26.3%), x-ray (27.6%), or acute proton (25.8%) irradiated
control groups (60–200 tumors from 30–40 mice/group were observed; Figure 3B). CDDOEA pretreatment prior to sSPE exposure showed a decreased number of non-structured pits.
Colon tissues were also categorized by immunohistochemistry of cyclin D1. In contrast to
unirradiated or acute proton-irradiated control, sSPE-exposed mice had more cyclin D1positive tumors (58%, p<0.05 compared to unirradiated control). Mice were also protected
from sSPE radiation with pretreatment of CDDO-EA and showed reduced cyclin D1positive tumors (7–12 tumors from 3 mice/group were examined) (Figure 3C).

Immunohistochemistry analysis for active-β-catenin showed markedly increased staining in
both tumors and tumor-adjacent normal areas of colonic tissue in the CPC;Apc mice 100
days after sSPE irradiation (Figure 4A). Quantification showed significantly higher staining
in the tumor-free normal area in sSPE-irradiated mice relative to tumor-free areas in
unirradiated control and acute proton-irradiated groups (p<0.0005) (Figure 4B). Along with
normal tissues, tumors in sSPE-irradiated mice also showed higher active-β-catenin staining
(p<0.0005) compared with unirradiated control and acute proton radiation groups (Figure
4C). Tumors in acute proton-irradiated mice also showed an increased staining of active-βcatenin (p<0.05) relative to unirradiated control. Quantification analysis was performed in
six fields of vision from the tumor-free and the tumor-bearing areas captured in each section.
Average data from 4 mice are graphically presented (Figure 4B–C).

Irradiation with sSPE Increases Expression of Senescence-associated Inflammatory
Response (SIR) Genes in Tumor-free Colon

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the mechanism of sSPE-induced increases in tumor initiation and progression in
CPC;Apc mice, the para-inflammation driving gut homeostasis/tumorigenesis model (17)
was examined 100 days after irradiation. Loss of Casein Kinase I alpha (CKIα) and/or
persistent DNA damage responses trigger Senescence-associated Inflammatory Responses
(SIR), a form of para-inflammation, an intermediate between basal homeostasis and chronic
inflammation in epithelial cells. SIR results in a breach of homeostasis, hyperproliferation,
tumorigenesis and invasive carcinogenesis with additional mutations in the tumor suppressor
TP53 (17). CPC;Apc mice exposed to sSPE showed increased DNA damage responses
(Figure 5A) and a significantly higher number of 53BP1-positive cells in normal colonic
crypts (p<0.0001) relative to acute proton irradiated tissue 4 hours after exposure (Figure
5B). Persistent DNA damage observed up to 4 days after sSPE irradiation (Figure S1) may
be due to increase of chronic oxidative stress. To test this we observed higher and persistent
oxidative damage in sSPE irradiated tumor-free colon tissues compared to unirradiated or
acute proton exposed tissues 100 days after irradiation (Figure S2). Casein kinase I alpha
(CKIα), a component of the β-catenin-destruction complex, is involved in a number of
cellular processes including DNA repair, cell division, and the Wnt signaling pathway (20).
Along with low expression of CKIα in colon tumors, lower expression of CKIα in the sSPEexposed tumor-free normal tissues was observed relative to unirradiated control (Figure 5C).

Author Manuscript

We further examined the expression of senescence-associated inflammatory genes that
changed after exposure to sSPE radiation. Tumor-adjacent normal colon tissues were
analyzed with qRT-PCR analysis 100 days after radiation exposure. Expression of a small
subset of genes was higher in mice irradiated with 2 Gy sSPE exposure relative to
unirradiated control. However, these same genes were not expressed at higher levels in 2 Gy
x-ray or acute proton irradiated groups (Figure 6A). A subset of SIR genes (Troy, Sox17,
Opg, Faim2, Lpo, Tlr2 and Ptges) and one PSIS gene (Plat), along with the senescence
associated gene (P19Arf) were markedly increased 100 days after 2 Gy sSPE irradiation
(Figure 6A–B). However, higher expression of these genes was not observed in 50 days post
2 Gy sSPE exposure group nor 100 days post 1 Gy sSPE exposure group (Figure S3).
Importantly, induction of these para-inflammatory genes was dramatically suppressed by
pretreatment of CDDO-EA (Figure 6).

Author Manuscript

Because the combined alteration of CKIα and p53 triggers high-grade adenocarcinomas
with series of gene activations (the p53-suppressed invasiveness signature, PSIS) (20), p53
expression level were assessed in tumors or tumor-free normal tissues. Compared to
unirradiated control, both acute proton and sSPE irradiated groups showed lower expression
of p53 in tumor-free and also tumor tissues 100 days after irradiation (Figure 5D). To
address the long-term effects of sSPE irradiation on TP53 mutagenesis, we examined a
specific mouse TP53 mutation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (28), which can detect as
little as 0.01% of a TP53 single nucleotide mutation in the wild-type background (Figure
S4). Because the mouse TP53 A156V mutation (corresponding to human codon A159) has
been reported at the deeply invasive colon adenocarcinoma in this CPC;Apc mouse model
(15), TP53 A156V mutation was examined to determine the effects of sSPE irradiation on

colorectal cancer progression. We designed a common primer pair and allele-specific
TaqMan probes conjugated with different fluorophores that distinguish between the wildtype and A156V mutant TP53 sequences to screen for the mutagenesis events (Figure 7A
and Figure S4). We analyzed 5 tumors per group and found that the frequency of the mutant
allele differed in each group (Figure 7B). Calculated frequency of the TP53 mutant allele
after sSPE exposure showed a significant (P= 0.02) 2.8-fold higher TP53 mutant frequency
compared to unirradiated or acute proton irradiated control (Figure 7C).

Discussion

Protons are the most common particle type in space and considered as a potential serious
damaging factor for increased risks of cancer and other diseases in astronauts. However, due
to unique dosimetric characteristics which can permit a finite range in tissues without an exit
dose (3), protons have become widely used for external beam radiation therapy in the
treatment of lung cancers, head and neck cancers, prostate cancers, sarcomas, brain tumors,
and gastrointestinal cancers (29–33). While clinic-based proton therapy is widely being
utilized, the biological long-term side effects/risks of protons have not been as carefully
examined. We show, for the first time, the pro-tumorigenic effects of low dose-rate proton
radiation in human FAP syndrome susceptible mouse model (CPC;Apc mice). We used 2 Gy
dose of proton because radiation therapy of human cancer commonly employs 2 Gy daily
fractions of ionizing radiation to achieve the planned total dose (34). In addition, crew
members on the International Space Station could receive doses of 2 Gy of proton radiation
or more during a solar flare event, even though shielding may partially but not completely
reduce these doses (35–36). In this study, SPE simulation (sSPE) was delivered at a low
dose-rate (at an average dose rate of 1.67 cGy/min) and acute protons and x-rays were
delivered at a higher dose-rate (20 cGy/min). It has been reported that ionizing radiation at
low dose-rate exposure can lead to higher DNA damage and cellular toxicity compared to
high dose-rate exposure in vitro (37). Here, we observed that sSPE exposure decreased both
the number of colonic crypts and overall maximum survival compared to acute proton
exposure in wild-type mice (Figure 1). In colon tissues of the CPC;Apc mice, low dose-rate
sSPE exposure showed higher acute DNA damage (Figure 5A–B) as well as chronic (100
days post irradiation) oxidative stress (Figure S2) compared to high dose-rate proton or
photon exposure. When considering the typical daily dose-rate for proton therapy is about
200 cGy/min (38), we propose that lower daily dose-rate of proton may provide better tumor
toxicity during proton therapy.

Author Manuscript

In addition to acute risk, mid-term (100 days post exposure) or long-term (time of death)
risks of low dose-rate proton exposure were determined in the CPC;Apc mice. Exposure to
sSPE radiation showed the development of a higher number of polyps compared to
unirradiated or acute proton irradiated groups 100 days after exposure. While unirradiated
and irradiated mice showed similar numbers of polyps at 50 days post-irradiation, sSPE
irradiated mice at 100 days increased the number of polyps more than 2-fold relative to
unirradiated control (Figure 2D). sSPE exposure may increase damage in normal non
cancerous colonic tissues in addition to increasing the damage to pre-existing hyperplastic
foci, but such damage was undetectable at 50 days post-irradiation. However, sSPE exposed
mice show an increased cancer burden by 100 days post-irradiation. Besides an increase in

the number of tumors (i.e. tumor initiation), tumor size and segmental distribution (i.e.
tumor promotion) were changed by sSPE radiation. Exposure to sSPE radiation showed
higher tumorigenesis in the middle and proximal colon region, and showed higher numbers
of large tumors relative to unirradiated or acute proton/x-ray irradiated groups 100 days after
exposure (Figure 2E–F). Cancer progression was accessed by histopathology at different
time points, including 100 days after irradiation and at time of death. Higher numbers of
adenocarcinomas were observed by both histopathological pit structure and
immunohistochemistry analysis in sSPE irradiated mice. Exposure to x-ray and acute proton
radiation did not show increased tumor progression 100 days after irradiation (Figure 3B–
C). However, at the time of death, a slight increase incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma
was observed with x-ray and acute proton exposure, along with significant increase of
invasive adenocarcinoma with sSPE exposure (Table 1).

To elucidate the mechanism of sSPE-induced increases in tumor initiation and progression in
CPC;Apc mice, para-inflammation driving tumorigenesis (17) was examined. The reduction
or absence of CKIα and/or chronic stress triggers low-grade senescence-associated
inflammatory responses (SIR) in the mouse intestine (17, 20). With further mutations in
TP53, senescent cells bypass growth inhibition checkpoints leading to accelerated colon
cancer tumorigenesis and invasiveness in combination with activation of the p53-suppressed
invasiveness signature (PSIS) (17, 20). In this study, we demonstrated that exposure to low
dose-rate proton (sSPE) resulted in more prolonged DNA damage (Figure 5A–B and Figure
S1) and oxidative stress (Figure S2) in the colon tissues relative to acute high dose-rate
proton radiation. We also observed that exposure to sSPE decreased expression of CKIα
(Figure 5C) and increased the frequency of TP53 mutations in the colon tumors (Figure 7C)
(A156V, which has been found in invasive colon carcinomas in this specific genetically
engineered mouse model, CPC;Apc (15)). Therefore, a set of SIR genes (Troy, Sox17, Opg,
Faim2, Lpo, Tlr2 and Ptges) and one PSIS gene (Plat), along with the senescence associated
gene (P19Arf) were observed to be increased in colon tissues exposed to sSPE 100 days
post-irradiation (Figure 6). Overexpression of these genes were also observed in colon
tumors (data not shown). These results imply that sSPE increases tumorigenesis by inducing
SIR and PSIS in the mouse intestine. In contrast to 2 Gy sSPE, acute 2 Gy proton, 2 Gy xray and 1 Gy sSPE did not activate these genes (Figure S3), suggesting that these genes
might be a novel biomarker of dose- and dose-rate-dependent proton irradiation.

Charged particles are also considered to be one of the major risk factors for humans in
space, and have emerged as a critical issue to be resolved for safe long-term missions both
orbital and interplanetary. During Solar Particle Events (SPE), significant spikes in the
energy and fluence of proton particles from a solar flare increase the risk of astronaut
exposure to higher doses of protons. Typically SPEs develop rapidly and may last a few
hours to several days emitting low dose-rate irradiation. Moreover, the occurrence, duration
and size of individual events are currently unpredictable (39). In the interplanetary space
environment, the radiation field consists of 2% electrons, 85.3% protons, 11.8% alpha
particles (helium nuclei), and less than 1% of high charge (Z) and energy (E) (HZE)
particles. Although HZE particles only account for a small amount of the GCR particle
fluxes, they significantly contribute to the biological effects of space radiation (40). While
protons may have less biological effects compared to HZE particles, their abundance in the

space radiation field needs to be examined much more closely. In addition, HZE particles
may also have important implications for carcinogenesis. To address this possibility, we
compared the carcinogenic effects of Silicon (28Si) particle with sSPE exposure. Exposure to
acute 2 Gy 28Si (600 MeV/n) with a dose-rate of 20 cGy/min showed similar tumor
initiation, invasiveness and decreased lifespan as with 2 Gy sSPE irradiated CPC;Apc mice
(manuscript in preparation). Though exposure to 2 Gy 28Si showed similar tumorigenic/
invasive activity as 2 Gy sSPE, SIR/PSIS gene expression which were induced by sSPE
exposure were not activated with 2 Gy 28Si exposure in tumor-free colon tissues, indicating
that different types of radiation exposure activate different mechanisms to induce
tumorigenesis/invasiveness in vivo (manuscript in preparation). Previously fractionated
exposure of 56Fe-particle was reported to enhance lung cancer progression compared to
acute 56Fe irradiation (41). In this study, however, fractionated 28Si irradiation reduced
cancer progression in the colon. Colonic epithelial cells grow faster compared to bronchial
epithelial cells and their turn over time is about 3–4 days. Therefore, our data can be
interpreted to indicate that different type of tissues have different mechanisms to suppress or
activate tumorigenesis in response to single- or multiple-fractionated radiation exposures.

In this study, we demonstrated tumorigenic effects of proton radiation in a colorectal cancer
susceptible mouse model with dose- and dose-rate-dependent effects. Exposure to low doserate proton (SPE simulation) increased the initiation as well as progression of colorectal
cancer by inducing a set of SIR/PSIS genes expression (Figure 8). The SIR genes induced
by the low dose-rate proton was different when compared with high dose-rate proton or 28Siinduced tumorigenesis indicating that there is a radiation quality dependency in radiationinduced tumorigenesis mechanisms. While proton therapy in patients is delivered in a highly
localized manner, our studies used whole-body irradiation to determine tumorigenic effects.
Thus, it is important to note that these present results cannot be extrapolated to the side
effects of localized proton therapy in patients. Previously, we have reported that CDDO-EA
reduces inflammation and DNA damage against photon irradiation by Nrf2 activation (22).
Here, we also demonstrated that pretreatment with CDDO-EA protects mice and reduces
tumor initiation and progression against sSPE exposure. CDDO-EA enhanced DNA repair
and inhibited induction of SIR/PSIS gene expression after low dose-rate proton exposure. A
new synthetic triterpenoid derivative (known as RTA408, Reata Pharmaceuticals) also has
been studied as a radioprotector (42) and is currently in clinical trial for preventing
radiation-induced dermatitis in patients receiving radiotherapy (NCT02142959).
Collectively, these studies imply that exposure to low dose-rate protons activate SIR/PSIS
gene expression by prolonged DNA damage and cellular senescence, which induces tumor
initiation/progression. A synthetic triterpenoid (CDDO-EA) is a potent radioprotector
against proton cancer therapy as well as a potential radioprotector and perhaps mitigator of
space radiation.

Fearon (U. of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI), and a breeding colony was
maintained in-house at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW, TX) facility. All animal
handling procedure was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
(IACUC) of UTSW and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, NY). The mice were
housed 1–5 mice per cage and provided with Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet
(#2018). All male and female animals, 5 to 8 weeks of age, were shipped from UTSW to
BNL and were acclimated for up to 1 week before irradiation. A subset of control WT and
CPC;Apc mice were shipped to BNL to account for stress in shipping and handling. All
animals were transported via World Courier’s (New Hyde Park, NY) overnight delivery and
returned to UTSW within 1 week after irradiation.
Synthetic triterpenoid

Author Manuscript

The synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)
along with chemically modified derivatives, CDDO-Me (methyl ester, also known as
bardoxolone methyl, BARD) and CDDO-EA (ethyl amide) are non-cytotoxic, highly
multifunctional and orally available drugs that have been studied as anti-inflammatory and
anti-oxidation agents in vivo and in vitro (43–45). Because ethyl amide derivative of a
synthetic triterpenoid, CDDO-EA, has been reported to have enhanced pharmacodynamic
activity in mouse assays compared to CDDO-Me (46), CDDO-EA (400 mg/kg diet)
(provided from Reata Pharmaceuticals, Irving Texas, and Dr. Michael Sporn, Dartmouth
Medical School, NH, USA) was first dissolved in an oily vehicle and prepared into chow
pellets (Lab Diet #5002) by Purina (Purina-Mills, Richmond, IN, USA) (47). Group of mice
were continuously fed a CDDO-EA diet or Control diet (Lab Diet #5002) for 3 days prior to
radiation exposure.

Radiation exposure

Author Manuscript

Mice were irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL and proton
dosimetry was calculated by the NSRL physics team. Mice were housed individually in
rectangular plastic cuboids boxes (#530C, AMAC Plastic Products, Petaluma, CA) and then
whole-body irradiated with 2 Gy of simulated SPE (low dose-rate) or acute 50 MeV/n (high
dose-rate) protons. The assembly of 25 animal cubicles was collectively arranged in an array
(5 × 5) within the 20 cm × 20 cm beam area. The energy spectrum for the SPE simulation
was adapted to mouse dose levels and consisted of 91.67% of the proton dose at energy of
50 MeV/n to 0.14% of the proton dose at 150 MeV/n as described previously (21) (Table
S1). The 2 Gy of simulated SPE (low dose-rate proton) was delivered over 2 hours (average
dose rate was about 1.67 cGy/min) and acute high dose-rate proton (50 MeV/n) was
delivered with a dose-rate of 20 cGy/min. To assure uniform beam penetration through the
mice, the sample assembly was rotated 180° in the vertical axis after completion of 25% of
the desired dose. Groups of mice were irradiated using the X-RAD 320 irradiator (Precision
X-ray, Inc) at UTSW. Mice were held in ventilated 50 ml conical Falcon tubes and placed 50
cm from the radiation source (SSD). A 5 cm diameter brass collimator was placed in the
collimator holder. Mice were irradiated with a dose rate of 20 cGy/min.

Polyp counts and sampling

Author Manuscript

Irradiated mice and age matched sham-irradiated control mice were euthanized 50 or 100
days after radiation exposure. The colon was surgically removed and was flushed gently
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. The colon was placed on a plate
and cut open longitudinally. Polyps were counted by two independent observers. Data from
multiple experiments were pooled to achieve statistical significance. Scale was used to
measure the polyp size. Polyps were then carefully dissected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at −80°C for further DNA, RNA or protein assays. Adjacent tumor-free normal
colon tissues were also dissected. A subset of colonic tissue was fixed overnight in 10%
buffered formalin. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and 5-μm thick longitudinal
sections were prepared and used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
immunohistochemistry staining.

Invasive adenocarcinoma counts
Irradiated mice and age matched sham-irradiated control mice were sacrificed at the
experimental end points. The colon was surgically removed and was flushed gently with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. The colon was fixed overnight in 10%
buffered formalin. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and two longitudinal sections
were prepared with a 100 μm interval. H&E staining was performed using standard
protocols. A board certified pathologist accessed all sections in each study group for
invasive adenocarcinoma classified by penetrating neoplasia through the muscularis mucosa
(48).
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Unstained and deparaffinized colon sections were used for immunohistochemistry. Briefly,
immunostaining was performed after antigen retrieval using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in
a microwave for 20 min. After quenching endogenous peroxidase activity using 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 5 min, the sections were blocked and exposed to the respective
primary antibodies. Vectastain Universal ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
and ImmPACT™ DAB kit (Vector Laboratories) were used for signal detection and color
development. To determine specificity of the staining, appropriate controls were run in
parallel with the experimental sections. Images were captured using bright field microscopy
(Axioskop2 Plus, Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) at a magnification of 20× with 7–12
tumors from 3 mice and were analyzed using ImmumoRation plug-in of ImageJ v1.47
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethedsa, MD). Mean data of average arbitrary pixel
unit of DAB color intensity per 20× field were normalized with arbitrary pixel unit of
hematoxylin intensity. The following antibodies were used: Active-β-catenin (Cat#05-665,
dilution 1:1000, Millipore); Cyclin D1 (Cat# 2978s, dilution 1:100, Cell Signaling); 53BP1
(Cat# ab36823, dilution 1:100, Abcam).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Frozen colon tumors or tumor-free normal colon tissues were homogenized using a liquid
nitrogen-cooled mortar (Bel-Art™ Scienceware™, Fisher Scientific) and total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, MD). RNA (1 μg) was subjected to reverse

transcription using the First strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, IN)
and mRNA expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR using SsoFast™ EvaGrenn®
Supermix (Bio-Rad, CA) in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche, IN). Primers for senescenceassociated inflammatory response genes are used as described previously (17). Sequences of
RT-PCR primers are listed in Table S2. Relative quantities of gene transcripts were
calculated and normalized to geometric mean of UBC, TBP, GUSB, and GAPDH
transcripts.
Western Blot Analysis

Author Manuscript

Frozen colon tumors or tumor-free normal colon tissues were homogenized using liquid
nitrogen-cooled mortar (Bel-Art™ Scienceware™, Fisher Scientific) and were lysed in icecold lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH7.5, 120mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA)
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged
and supernatants used for protein assays. Equal amounts of protein was further mixed with
5× SDS-Laemmli buffer and boiled at 95°C for 10 min, followed by a brief centrifugation.
Proteins were separated by 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX™ Precast Gel (Bio-Rad, CA), and
transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer System (Bio-Rad,
CA). The following antibodies were used: p53 (Cat# ab26, dilution 1:1,000, Abcam); β-actin
(Cat# A1978, dilution 1:20,000, Sigma Aldrich). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or antirabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies at 1:5000 dilution and
detected with the SuperSignalWest Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (dilution 1:5,
Thermo Scientific) and the gel documentation system, G:BOX (Syngene, Frederick, MD).
Detection of point mutations by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We manually designed the primers and probe using Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/
primer3-0.4.0/). The melting temperature (Tm) of both primers are equal and TaqMan
probes Tm is designed 10°C higher than the primer Tm. Optimal primer pair and custom
TaqMan probes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Table S3). For optimization of the
PCR annealing temperature, we mixed the following reagents: 10 μl 2× ddPCR Supermix for
Probes (Bio-Rad), 50 nM FAM probe, 50 nM HEX probe, 500 nM forward primer, 500 nM
reverse primer and 10 nM template of a wild-type allele or a mutant allele (20 μl total
volume). Droplet generation using a QX100 Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad) was performed as
described previously (49). The reaction was transferred into a 96-well PCR plate for gradient
PCR on a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling program was: step 1, 95°C
10 min; step 2, 95°C 30 s; step 3, 50°C–65°C gradient 30 s; step 4, 72°C 30 s; repeat steps
2–4 39 times; step 5, 98°C 10 min. After the PCR was complete, the droplets were analyzed
using a QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad). We chose the optimal annealing temperature that
gave the best separation between negative, FAM-positive and HEX-positive populations. The
optimal annealing temperature for the TP53 mutation was 60°C.
To detect point mutagenesis in TP53, we mixed the following reagents in 8-tube PCR strips:
10 μl 2× ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad), 50 nM FAM probe, 50 nM HEX probe,
500 nM forward primer, 500 nM reverse primer and 10 ng genomic DNAs (20 μl total
volume). Droplets were generated, which was followed by PCR at the optimal temperature

using T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad); the droplets were analyzed to calculate mutagenesis
frequencies. Mutagenesis frequency (%) was calculated as follows:

Cross-hybridization was excluded from quantitative analysis in ddPCR by setting the
threshold of detection high enough to discriminate true-positive droplets from false-positive
droplets. Our pilot experiment to measure sensitivity of ddPCR to detect single nucleotide
mutagenesis using template mixtures showed that we could detect as little as 0.01% of the
TP53 mutant allele in the wild-type background (Figure S4).

Figure 4. Prolonged activation of β-catenin in normal colons 100 days after sSPE radiation

Author Manuscript

(A) Representative images of β-catenin (brown) stained tumor free (normal) or tumor areas
of colon sections from unirradiated control, acute proton, and sSPE irradiated CPC;Apc
mice. Hematoxylin (blue) was used for counterstaining. (B) Quantification of total β-catenin
staining in tumor free (normal) areas of control, acute proton, and sSPE irradiated sections.
(C) Quantification of total β-catenin staining in tumor areas of control, acute proton, and
sSPE irradiated sections. Intensity of β-catenin staining was normalized with intensity of
hematoxylin staining. At least six fields of vision from the normal and tumor areas were
captured in each section and were analyzed. Average data from 4 mice are presented
graphically. *, P<0.05 and ****, P<0.001 in two-way ANOVA with Multiple comparisons.

Figure 7. ddPCR-base detection of a single-base mutation of TP53 in colon tumors

Author Manuscript

(A) Strategy for detection of mouse TP53 mutation (p.A156V/c.467C>T) showing a
common primer pair and allele-specific probes conjugated with different fluorophores (FAM
and HEX) are indicated. (B) ddPCR for the TP53 mutant and wild-type allelic
discrimination was performed with colon tumors from unirradiated (Unir), acute proton
irradiated (Acute), and sSPE irradiated (SPE) groups. Green and blue dots represent droplets
containing the mutant and the wild-type alleles, respectively. Note that while the probes
weakly cross-detected the wild-type and mutant alleles, this cross-hybridization can be
excluded from quantitative analysis in ddPCR by setting the threshold (pink line) of
detection high enough to discriminate true-positive droplets from false-positive droplets, as
shown here. N, negative control (no template); P, positive control (mutant template only).
(C) Quantificatioin of ddPCR shows the average frequency of the TP53 mutant allele. P
values calculated by Student’s t- test (n=5) are shown on the plot.

Figure 8. A schematic model of low dose-rate proton-induced tumorigenesis through parainflammation

Exposure to low dose-rate proton induces persistent DNA damage responses and oxidative
stress, which triggers senescence-inflammatory response (SIR). In p53-mutated tissues, SIR
results in a breach of homeostasis, hyperproliferation, invasion, and carcinogenesis.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, CDDO-EA, treatment moderates DNA damage,
oxidative stress, and para-inflammation, thus helping to regain homeostasis.
