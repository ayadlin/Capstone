BACKGROUND. Life expectancy is increasing, and more patients are presenting with cancer at an advanced age (80 years). Optimal
management for this group of patients has not been well defined. METHODS. The South Australian Clinical Registry for Metastatic
Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) collects data on all patients diagnosed since February 2006 in South Australia. The authors examined cancer characteristics, treatments administered, and outcomes for patients aged 80 years compared with patients aged <80 years.
RESULTS Data from 2314 patients were evaluable, and 29.2% of these patients were aged 80 years. The majority had moderately differentiated tumors. Poorly differentiated tumors were reported in fewer patients aged 80 years (20.1% vs 26.1%; P < .005). Overall,
28.1% of patients aged 80 years received chemotherapy, and 74.2% received single-agent fluoropyrimidines as first-line treatment.
By comparison, 68.2% of patients aged <80 years received chemotherapy, 74.3% received combination chemotherapy, and 25.7%
received single-agent fluoropyrimidine as first-line treatment. No treatment was received by 38.2% of patients aged 80 years compared with 11.4% of those aged <80 years. Participation in clinical trials was lower in patients aged 80 years (2% vs 13%). The median survival was worse for patients aged 80 years (8.2 months vs 19.2 months; P < .001), and the median survival of patients who
received chemotherapy was 19.0 months for those aged 80 years and 22.3 months for those aged <80 years (P ¼ .139). Patients
who did not receive treatment had a poor median survival regardless of age (2.6 months for patients aged 80 years vs 2.7 months
for patients aged <80 years). CONCLUSIONS. Patients aged 80 years were less likely to receive intervention for their metastatic
colorectal cancer and had poorer survival. The survival of selected patients aged 80 years who received chemotherapy was similar
to the survival of those aged <80 years despite the receipt of single-agent therapy. Patients aged 80 years with metastatic colorectal cancer are less likely to receive intervention for their disease and have poorer survival. Survival for selected patients aged 80
years who receive chemotherapy is similar to the survival of patients aged <80 years despite the receipt of single-agent therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and the highest
estimated rates are reported in Australia and New Zealand at 33.0 per 100,000 population.1 With advancements in health
care, we now face the challenge of dealing with an ageing population worldwide. The average life expectancy in Australia
is now 79 years for men and 84 years for women.2 The US Preventive Services Task Force has reported that, between
1973 and 2007, the percentage of patients aged 75 years who were diagnosed with CRC increased from 29% to 40% (P
< .0001).3 The optimal management for patients with advanced-stage disease in the older age group of patients aged 80
years is not clearly defined, because they are under-represented in clinical trials.
The survival of patients with advanced CRC has improved because of a combination of better preoperative staging,
the increasing acceptance of metastatectomy, and the introduction of newer chemotherapeutic agents. The median overall
survival (OS) has improved from <10 months with best supportive care, to 11 or 12 months with fluoropyrimidines, and
to nearly 2 years with combination chemotherapy.4,5 Although treatment with either initial combination chemotherapy
or single-agent therapy are appropriate options, survival is improved in patients who ultimately have access to all 3 active
chemotherapy agents (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine).4,6

Over 80s mCRC/Kumaret al

Older patients have distinct characteristics that need
to be taken into account before planning their cancer
treatment, such as concomitant medical problems, sensory impairments, and lower physiologic reserves. In addition, there is often a lack of social support and
transportation. Intensive therapy is less likely to be recommended for an older patient compared with a younger
patient. Even when patients are highly functional and
lacking in comorbidities, advanced age itself may be a
deterring factor in recommending intensive therapy.7
Elderly patients are under-represented in mCRC
clinical trials. There are retrospective data on treatment
choices for older patients, but the definition of ‘‘elderly’’
often varies from patients aged >65 years to patients aged
>75 years.8–10 Those reports indicated that older patients
are less commonly offered surgery and chemotherapy8,11,12 despite evidence indicating that chemotherapy
has similar efficacy in elderly and younger cohorts.10
Although these data are helpful, as the population ages,
the numbers of patients will be increasing in the very old
categories, a group for which this information may not be
as reliable, because there is a distinct lack of data on very
old patients, particularly for those aged >80 years. With
this in mind, in the current study, we used data from the
South Australian Clinical Registry (SACR) from patients
with advanced CRC to assess the impact of advanced age
in octogenarians on treatments offered and survival
outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The SACR for advanced CRC is a state-wide, populationbased database that was established in February 2006. All
patients who were diagnosed with synchronous or metachronous mCRC after February 1, 2006 are entered into
the database. Data are collected on patient details, disease
characteristics, investigations, histopathology, treatment,
and outcomes in this broad population setting. For the
current analysis, data collected between February 2, 2006
and February 14, 2012 were included. Patient data were
accessed using the relevant International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD10AM) codes (C18, C19, C20, C21, C78, C79, Z51.1,
Z511, Z29.2, Z292) from inpatient and outpatient
encounters, histopathology reports, clinical notification,
attendance at multidisciplinary meetings, and death
audits provided by the South Australian Central Cancer
Registry, which sought initial core data on age, sex, demographics, tumor site, histologic type, differentiation, and
metastatic site(s). Treatment data consisted of surgical
procedures, chemotherapy (including targeted therapy),

each patient was obtained through a medical records
review and electronic linkage with the state death
records.
All analyses were undertaken using the STATA (version
11; Stata Corp., College Station, Tex) data-analysis and statistical software package. Disease-specific survival analysis was
undertaken using the conventional Kaplan-Meier method.
Survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of stage IV
disease to the date of death, with a final censoring date of
patients who were alive on February 14, 2012. The log-rank
test of equality was used for comparisons.

aged 80 years, and the median age was 85 years (range,
80–105 years) in the group aged 80 years and 67 years
(range, 17–79 years) in the group aged <80 years. Men
were represented by 48.5% of patients aged 80 years
and by 59.7% of those aged <80 years. Colon cancer
was the primary diagnosis in 78.4% of patients aged
80 years and in 72.6% of those aged <80 years. The
majority of patients had moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Poorly differentiated tumors were reported in
20.1% of patients aged 80 years and in 26.1% of those
aged <80 years. A synchronous primary tumor was
reported in 62.3% of patients aged 80 years and in
65.3% of those aged <80 years. In patients who had
metachronous disease, the disease stage at initial diagnosis was equally balanced for all stages between the 2 age
cohorts. Similarly, the time-to-progression (TTP) was
balanced for patients with stage I and III disease; however, patients with stage II disease aged 80 years had a
longer TTP (28.8 months vs 22.7 months; P ¼ .0058).
Three or more sites of metastatic disease were reported in
8% of patients aged 80 years and in 9.2% of those
aged <80 years. These data are summarized in Table 1.
Treatments

The younger group of patients had a higher treatment
rate across all treatments. The treatments received by
patients in the metastatic setting are summarized in
Table 2.
Surgery

Liver-only metastases were reported in 35.7% of
patients aged 80 years and in 39.7% of those aged <80
years. Metastatectomy by liver re was undergone by
6.1% of patients aged 80 years and by 15.3% of those
aged <80 years. Surgery of the primary tumor or metastatectomy was undergone by 41.9% of patients aged
80 years and by 56.7% of those aged <80 years.
724

Chemotherapy

Only 28.1% of patients aged 80 years received
any chemotherapy, and 74.2% of those patients received
single-agent fluoropyrimidine as first-line chemotherapy.
In comparison, 68.2% of patients aged <80 years
received first-line chemotherapy; and, in 74.3% of those
patients, this was a combination regimen. Regardless of
age, the majority of those who received single-agent regimens received capecitabine, and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy was the favored combination chemotherapy.
Among patients aged 80 years who received first-line
chemotherapy, 35% and 33% went on to receive secondline and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. Among
patients aged <80 years who received first-line chemotherapy, 53% and 48% went on to receive second-line
and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. In the group
aged 80 years, combination chemotherapy was received
by 67% and 72% of patients in the second-line and
third-line settings, respectively. In the group aged <80
years, combination chemotherapy was received by 68%
and 51% of patients in the second-line and third-line settings, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the chemotherapy regimens that were used in the metastatic setting by
line of treatment.
Targeted therapies with monoclonal antibodies
were received by 2.4% of patients aged 80 years and by
16% of those aged <80 years. Radiotherapy was received
by 9.9% of patients aged 80 years and by 22.2% of
those aged <80 years. Testing for v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations was
performed in 29 patients aged 80 years (4.3%; 40%
had wild-type KRAS) and in 304 patients aged <80 years
(18.6%; 66% had wild-type KRAS).
In addition, 13% of patients aged <80 years (n ¼
173) were enrolled in clinical trials compared with 2%
(n ¼ 12) in the older group. No treatment was received
by 38.2% of patients aged 80 years or by 11.4% of
patients aged <80 years who had stage IV disease. These
data are summarized in Table 1.
Survival Outcomes

The median OS for all patients was 8.2 months for the
group aged 80 years compared with 19.2 months for
the group aged <80 years (P < .0001) (see Fig. 1). The
median OS for patients who received chemotherapy was
19.0 months for the group aged 80 years and 22.3
months for the group aged <80 years (P ¼ .139).
Patients who did not receive any treatment had a poor
OS regardless of their age, with a median OS 2.6 months
in those aged 80 years and 2.7 months in those aged
<80 years.

diagnosed with early stage disease, when separated
according to whether they had their primary tumor
removed, still favored patients aged <80 years. The OS
outcome for patients with liver-only or lung-only metastases who underwent metastatectomy was not affected by
age. The OS of patients who initially had early stage disease separated according to those who did and did not
receive adjuvant chemotherapy still favored the younger
cohort. The TTP for those initially diagnosed with early
stage disease, separated according to a TTP of <12
months and a TTP  12 months, favored younger
patients in terms of OS.

DISCUSSION
Patients at an advanced age represent a significant proportion of patients who are diagnosed with mCRC. This is
likely to become an increasing issue for the medical oncologist as the ‘‘baby boomers’’ mature into old age. The current retrospective analysis has demonstrated the impact of
advanced age on treatments offered for mCRC and the
survival outcomes.
Patients at an advanced age have inferior survival
outcomes compared with younger patients, and those
aged <80 years live more than twice as long than those
aged 80 years. This disparity in survival was not
observed when only those who received chemotherapy for
mCRC were analyzed. Subgroup analyses favored a better
survival outcome for younger patients compared with
patients aged 80 years. Although the hazard ratios for

patients who have stage I tumors at diagnosis and well differentiated tumors crossed the line of neutrality, the number of patients in these groups was small. It is noteworthy
that the OS of patients who underwent liver resection for
liver-only metastases was not influenced by age, and the
same was true for those who underwent pulmonary metastatectomy; however, the latter group was relatively small.
We have demonstrated that patients aged >80 years
are 3 times less likely to be offered treatment than younger
patients. We were unable to determine why older patients
received less treatment, because the population-based
registry did not capture information on patient comorbidities, performance status, or patient wishes. Foster and colleagues demonstrated that advanced age can deter
oncologists from choosing intensive cancer therapy, even
for patients who are highly functional and lack comorbidities.7 The patterns of care revealed in our study suggest
the potential under-treatment of patients with advanced
age. However, patients who were deemed appropriate
candidates for palliative chemotherapy had similar survival outcomes in both younger and older age groups.
Furthermore, similar survival outcomes were observed
among those who were deemed unsuitable for palliative
chemotherapy regardless of age.
Patients aged <80 years are more likely to be offered
upfront combination chemotherapy as first-line and second-line treatments. For those aged 80 years, singleagent fluoropyrimidine upfront is more common; and,
when clinically appropriate, combination chemotherapy
as second-line and third-line regimens is used. This
appears to be an effective strategy for select octogenarians
726

who are robust enough to tolerate chemotherapy. In our
cohort, nearly 40% of those who were offered first-line
chemotherapy were deemed suitable for second-line
chemotherapy; this was a reasonably high number, most
likely because of a strong selection bias for fit patients in
the first-line setting. Both treatments sequentially incorporate different cytotoxic agents. This practice is supported by data from the Medical Research Council
Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, and Irinotecan; Use and
Sequencing (FOCUS) trial13; the Capecitabine, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
(CAIRO) trial14; and French Federation of Digestive Oncology trial 2000-05 (FFCD 2000-05)15. In our study, it
is interesting to note that fewer patients of advanced age
went on to receive second-line treatment (P < .0001) and
third-line treatment (P ¼ .02) compared with younger
patients, yet both groups had similar OS. This implies
that single-agent fluoropyrimidines may be sufficient to
manage patients aged 80 years, although this also may
be explained by selection bias for physiologically robust
patients with good performance status in the group aged
80 years, a group that also may have tolerated and benefited from combination therapy. This remains an unanswered question. The FFCD 2000-05 study is particularly
relevant, because approximately 40% of patients in that
study were aged >70 years compared with patients in the
CAIRO trial, in which 22% were aged >70 years.14,15
The FFCD 2000-05 trial demonstrated that combination
chemotherapy was more toxic than single-agent regimens,
with no loss in survival advantage when a single-agent regimen was used.15 Our data support these results in that we

were able to use a reduced-intensity regimen without
compromising survival. Upfront, single-agent fluoropyrimidine is appealing in the advanced age group, because it
does not have the cumulative dose-limiting toxicity of
oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy. The
FOCUS2 study included frail elderly patients with
mCRC and used an upfront 20% dose reduction, and the
results suggested a potential benefit from combination
schedules. By using traditional measures of efficacy, adding oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidines resulted in a trend toward better progression-free survival (PFS), but this did
trend not reach statistical significance. However, when
using their composite endpoint of overall therapeutic utility (an objective and subjective measure of efficacy from
the patient’s and clinician’s perspective), those investigators reported that the preferred combination was dosereduced oxaliplatin, which was paired with 5-fluorouracil
because of the increased risk of adverse events with
capecitabine.13
Several targeted therapies have been developed over
the last decade in the management of mCRC. The use
and safety of these agents in the very elderly will need to
be considered. The commonly used agents include bevacizumab (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif), cetuximab (Merck Serono, Geneva, Switzerland), and
panitumumab (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif). Our data
suggest that the use of these agents is relatively low. However, this may reflect the degree of access to these medicines in Australia around the time of our data analysis.
However, the rate of use of such targeted agents was lower
in patients of advanced age (2.4%) compared with the
younger group (16%). This suggests that patient age does
have an impact on the addition of biologic agents to cytotoxic chemotherapy or as monotherapy despite the lack of
evidence of any difference in clinical outcomes or major
toxicity concerns. In a retrospective analysis, Price et al16
concluded that, in medically fit older patients, bevacizumab (Genentech) provided PFS and OS benefits similar
to what were observed in younger patients. There has
been some concern that bevacizumab may be associated
with an increased incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolic events in elderly patients; however, recent data
have not confirmed this possibility.17
KRAS testing was not performed frequently in our
population, although epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-targeted therapies are attractive for octogenarians. In the National Cancer Institute CO.17 study, in
which anti-EGFR therapy was assessed, a planned subgroup analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in the PFS or OS of patients who received
Cancer

February 15, 2013

cetuximab (Merck Serono) between patients aged <65
years and those aged >65 years.18 A similar result was
reported in a recent German study that focused on the
role of cetuximab (Merck Serono) either as monotherapy
or paired with cytotoxic agents in elderly patients who
had diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, this
benefit was lost for those with poor performance status.19
These data are quite compelling in favor of using cetuximab (Merck Serono) in patients aged 80 years who have
medical comorbidities but good performance status.
Patients of advanced age are under-represented in
clinical trials, and only 2% of these patients are being
recruited to studies. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results database indicates that 31% of cancers are
diagnosed in patients aged >75 years,19 and only 9% of
patients in clinical trials for a new drug or a new indication through the US Food and Drug Administration are
aged >75 years.20 Elderly patients receive the same standard treatment that has its evidence base in a younger population. Age-associated decline in functional reserve,
increase in comorbid conditions, concomitant medication
use, and delayed diagnosis all limit the accrual of the elderly to clinical trials and aggressive therapeutic interventions. Thus, clinicians are left with doubts regarding the
role of such treatments in the elderly, highlighting the
need for specific geriatric oncology research.
Currently, the decision to offer chemotherapy to
older patients with mCRC is based on the clinician’s acumen. Given the potential benefit in selected very elderly
patients, validated tools that can provide an objective
assessment and assist in the decision-making process for
very elderly patients with mCRC should be considered.
One example is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
(CGA), which is a validated inventory that allows the clinician to estimate life expectancy, assess treatment tolerance, and identify reversible factors that may interfere
with cancer treatment, including depression, malnutrition, anemia, neutropenia, and lack of caregiver support.
The information gained from this can be prescriptive in
identifying those who can be offered potentially curative
treatment, determining supportive measures that need to
be implemented, and those for whom best supportive care
is the optimal management strategy.7,21 This objective
measure also could be used to standardize clinical trials in
geriatric oncology. The CGA can be time-consuming,
however, and another validated tool is the Timed Up and
Go assessment, which can be completed in the outpatient
clinic in approximately 2 minutes. This tool has been validated to predict early death within 6 months of starting
chemotherapy and increased adverse effects from

chemotherapy.22 This is another objective measure that
could be used in the clinic to help inform decision-making
around palliative chemotherapy in octogenarians.
There are inherent limitations to data that are
acquired from a population-based registry study like ours.
The SACR does not collect data on the performance status
of patients and does not measure their comorbidities,
patient factors that would influence the clinician decision
to offer chemotherapy. The lack of data on performance
status around each line of chemotherapy places limitations
on the interpretation of the sequencing of different lines of
treatment. Furthermore, the outcomes from chemotherapy need to be considered against the duration of treatment, particularly with the drugs used to treat CRC, such
as 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and cetuximab,
for which there is no dose-limiting toxicity, so that patients
may continue treatment until they develop progression or
unacceptable toxicity. The relative dose intensity of chemotherapy is important for drugs like oxaliplatin, in which
peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting toxicity; however,
this information is not captured by the SACR.
In conclusion, the most elderly patients with mCRC
represent a heterogeneous group for which medical
comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and treatment toxicities need to be balanced in the decision-making process.
Elderly patients who are considered appropriate candidates for chemotherapy receive less intensive treatment
regimens without appearing to compromise efficacy compared with younger individuals. A better understanding of
outcomes in very elderly patients with mCRC needs to be
achieved through the greater involvement of such patients
in clinical trials that incorporate practical, validated tools
for patient selection.
