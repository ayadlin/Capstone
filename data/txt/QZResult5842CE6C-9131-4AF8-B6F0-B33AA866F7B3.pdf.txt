Abstract
Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed by pathologists for over a century.
PGCCs contribute to solid tumor heterogeneity, but their functions are largely undefined. Little
attention has been given to these cells, largely because PGCCs have been generally thought to
originate from repeated mitosis/cytokinesis failure and have no capacity for long-term survival
and cell proliferation. Here we report that we successfully purified and cultured PGCCs from
human ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer. These cells are highly resistant to
oxygen deprivation and could form through endoreduplication or cell fusion, generating regularsized cancer cells quickly through budding or burst. They are positive for normal and cancer stem
cell markers, divided asymmetrically and cycled slowly. They can differentiate into adipose,
cartilage, and bone. A single PGCC formed cancer spheroids in vitro and generated tumors in
immunodeficient mice. PGCC-derived tumor gained a mesenchymal phenotype with increased
expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44 and CD133 and become more resistant to the
treatment of cisplatin. Together, our results reveal that the PGCCs present a resistant form of
human cancer generated in response to hypoxia stress and can contribute to generation of cancer
stem-like cells and play a fundamental role in regulating tumor heterogeneity, stemness, and
chemoresistance in human cancer.

Introduction
Almost all human tumors display a certain level of heterogeneity(1, 2). Among the many
histopathologic features of human solid tumors is the presence of large atypical cancer cells
with multiple copies of DNAs, which is referred here to as polyploid giant cancer cells
(PGCCs) (3). PGCCs vary in number and usually become prominent in high pathologic

grades and late disease stages, or after chemotherapy. Nuclear features of PGCCs have been
used to predict prognosis for ovarian cancer (4). The giant cells have often been thought to
originate from repeated mitosis/cytokinesis failure or as intermediate products of genomic
instability (5, 6). As a result there have been neither reports of their isolation in culture nor
their detailed characterization, and the function, mechanisms of formation and role of
PGCCs in the development of human tumors is largely undefined.
Hypoxia is known to play an important role in normal tissue and tumor development (7, 8)
and is associated with the formation and maintenance of cancer stem cells (9); it promotes
the stem-like phenotype and tumorigenesis (10). Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) has been used as a
hypoxia mimic in cell culture and can activate hypoxia-mediated signaling pathways (11).
Here we report the successful purification and stable maintenance of PGCCs from cancer
cell lines and human primary ovarian tumors with the use of CoCl2. Our studies of stably
passaged PGCCs revealed many unexpected biologic features. The division patterns of
PGCCs are remarkably similar to that of simple organisms. These results strongly suggest
that PGCCs represent a dormant form of cancer cells in a stress-induced cancer cell life
cycle that can actively contribute to the tumor growth through the generation of cancer stemlike cells.

Results
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PGCCs Exist in Multiple Cancer Cell Line
Scattered giant PGCCs were observed in HEY, SKOv3 and MDA-MB-231 lines grown in
regular media. Addition of CoCl2 into the medium selectively killed the regular-sized cancer
cells but not PGCCs. Typical PGCCs from HEY and MDA-MB-231 cells displayed
morphology similar to that of neuron. PGCCs of SKOV3 were round and lack of branches
(Fig. 1A). These PGCCs from CoCl2 have identical genotype with the parental cell lines,
which have been confirmed by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiles analysis (Table S1).
Furthermore, 10 ovarian cancer cell lines including two newly established lines from
primary culture and breast cancer cell line MCF-7, phoenix and 293T cells (Fig. S1A) were
treated with CoCl2. All of these cell lines showed enriched or purified PGCCs following
CoCl2 treatment. PGCCs can also be induced by physiological hypoxia when cultured with
0.1% oxygen (Fig. S1B). The common morphological characteristics of PGCCs were the
large size and giant nucleus. We define the PGCC as a cancer cell that is at least three times
larger in size as compared with that of parental cancer cells. The mean size of the PGCCs
was 3–10 times larger than those of the regular cancer cells.
Characterization of PGCCs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Flow cytometry analysis indicated that there were more G2/M phase cells after CoCl2
treatment (Fig. 1B). The presence of multiple DNA copies in individual PGCCs was
confirmed by X chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 1C). PGCCs were not
senescent, as shown by negative beta-Galstaining (Fig. 1D). Since CoCl2 is a hypoxia mimic
by stabilizing the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) (12), we
examined the expression of HIF1alpha. As shown in Figure 1E, HIF-1alpha expression was
markedly elevated in PGCCs as compared with levels in regular HEY and SKOv3 cells. In
addition, elongation initiation factor 2 alpha (EIF2alpha) expression is down-regulated in
PGCCs (Fig. 1E), suggesting that protein translation may be turned off to keep slow cell
cycle. Furthermore, CD133 expression is markedly increased, suggesting that PGCCs may
gain the properties of cancer stem-like cells.

PGCCs Undergo Asymmetric Division and Cycle Slowly

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have observed two asymmetric cell division patterns in PGCCs: budding and bursting,
individually or in combination. Budding of daughter cells from PGCCs usually occurred
from the branches of PGCCs (Fig. 2A, HEY PGCC1) and the body of PGCCs that contain
multiple nuclei and followed by the burst release of numerous small daughter cells (Fig. 2A,
HEY PGCC2, and MDA-MB-231 PGCC). To further confirm the budding division from
PGCCs, we performed a time time-lapse imaging analysis on HEY PGCC and budding of
small daughter cells from PGCC occurred from the body of PGCCs (Fig. S2A and S2B).
These results suggest that PGCCs produced daughter cells via the mechanisms for growth
and division of simple organisms such as yeasts or other unicellular organisms (13, 14).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two types of PGCCs were observed after staining: giant nucleated cells or multinucleated
giant cells. Figure 2B showed the cell budding from the two types of PGCCs in HEY,
SKOv3 and MDA-MB-231. We performed total cell counts of the purified HEY PGCCs
every 2 days for 15 days. The total number of small cells increased minimally in the first 8
days; a large number of small cells started to bud out on the 9th day, and then there was an
explosive increase in the total number of cells (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the nature
of the division of PGCCs, we labeled PGCCs with PKH26, which is usually lost quickly in
rapidly dividing cells (15). We monitored the daughter cells from PGCCs in vitro and in
vivo. PGCCs and daughter cells stained with PKH26 were observed over a period of 5 days.
The PGCCs showed continued fluorescence on day 5 while the fluorescence was largely
absent in the daughter cells (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3A). Nocodazole (cell cycle inhibitor) was
used to inhibit PGCCs to generate the daughter cells and the fluorescent dye was maintained
in PGCCs even after day 10 (Fig. S3B). In vivo, we subcutaneously injected 3000 PGCCs
labeled with PKH26 into nude mice and examined frozen tumor sections for fluorescence. A
few PGCCs with red fluorescence were observed in the tumor tissue, but most of tumor cells
had lost fluorescence (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the PGCCs were also slow-cycling in
vivo.
PGCCs Can Generate Tumor Spheroids

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When PGCCs were cultured in stem cell medium; many spheroids of HEY, SKOv3 and
MDA-MB-231 appeared in the flask (Fig. 3A). Spheroids from a single PGCC of HEY,
SKOv3 and MDA-MB-231 can be observed when grown in stem cell medium and Matrigel
(Fig. 3A). To further demonstrate the ability of each single PGCC to form spheroids, we
serially diluted HEY PGCCs in Matrigel with 3–5 PGCCs in each well of a 24-well plate.
Single PGCCs can form spheroids on the 5th day after seeding in Matrigel (Fig. 3B-a and b). When spheroids from HEY PGCCs embedded in paraffin blocks were subjected to
immunohistochemical staining, they were positive for CD44 and CD133 (Fig. 3B-c and -d).
To determine the tumorigenicity of PGCCs in vivo, we subcutaneously injected a single
spheroid derived from a single HEY PGCC into nude mice. Six tumors formed in all 3 nude
mice with two sites injection for each mouse. Histological examination showed that the
resulting tumor cells had a higher nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and were more mesenchymal
(Fig. 3B). The spheroids from HEY and MDA-MB-231-derived PGCCs showed scattered
positive cells for OCT3/4, Nanog, SOX-2, and ABCG2 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that at least
part of these cells within these spheroids may have stem-like properties. The PGCC
spheroid-derived tumors had lower cytokeratin expression and higher vimentin expression
than the control (Fig. 3D). Results of immunohistochemical staining showed that the PGCC
spheroid-derived tumors were positive for CD44 and CD133, while most of the tumor cells
generated from regular HEY injection were negative (Fig. 3D). The expression of
cytokeratin, vimentin, CD44 and CD133 between PGCCs and regular cancer cells is further
validated by western blot (Fig. 3E).

Alteration of Cell Cycle-related Protein Expression in PGCCs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We examined the expression of a panel of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation in
PGCCs from HEY and SKOv3. The expression of p53 protein is elevated in PGCCs and
PGCCs with budding. Expression level of cyclin E, and cyclin D1 was markedly elevated in
purified HEY PGCCs compared with regular HEY cells. HEY PGCCs with budding had the
highest expression of CDK2 and cyclin B1. For SKOv3, increased expression level of
CDK2 and cyclin D1 was found in purified SKOv3 PGCCs while the level of cyclin B1,
cyclin E, and CDK4 expression was decreased in PGCCs as compared with control SKOv3
(Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that PGCCs have a distinct protein expression involved
in cell cycle regulation.
DNA Transport of PGCC and PGCC Formation by Cell Fusion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since PGCCs produce daughter cells via budding from the branches, we examined how
DNA is transported in PGCCs. We stained these cells with Hoechst33342 to trace the
branches of PGCCs for the presence or absence of DNA after trypsin digestion. DNA was
not found in the branches of HEY PGCCs 8 hours after digestion (Fig. 4B-a and -b).
However, DNA reappeared in the branches 4 days after trypsin digestion (Fig. 4B-c and -d).
These results demonstrate that the branches of PGCCs can serve as vessels for DNA
transport. DNA transportation in the branches can also be observed in MDA-MB-231
PGCCs and PGCCs from human ovarian cancer primary culture (Fig. 4B-g and -h).
It has also been reported that giant cells can be formed through cell fusion (16–19). To
determine whether cell fusion is involved in PGCC formation, we mixed eGFP-labeled
regular HEY cells with regular HEY cells stained with PKH26 or labeled with RFP; the
mixed cells were co-cultured and then treated with CoCl2. Cell fusion was examined by
fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figures 4C, yellow fluorescence indicating cell
fusion was clearly visible. High concentration of CoCl2 seclectively kill the regular-sized
cells; while low concentration can induce the formation of PGCCs through cell fusion.
PGCC formation via cell fusion can also been observed in MDA-MB-231, SKOv3 and
labeled with eGFP and RFP (Fig. 4C). Fusion-created PGCCs were approximately 10–20%
of the total number of PGCCs present in the cultures.
PGCCs are highly tumorigenic

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We isolated a single PGCC by means of serial dilution and injected into them into mice. The
resulting tumor was excised and examined for histopathology. The tumors formed from
HEY, SKOv3 and MDA-MB-231 PGCCs injection display mesenchymal changes when
compared with the control (Fig. 5A). As shown in Table 1, tumors formed in 3 of 4 nude
mice injected with 10 HEY PGCCs, 7 of 12 nude mice injected with a single SKOv3 PGCC
and 8 of 12 nude mice injected with a single MDA-MB-231 PGCC. The rates of tumor
formation from PGCCs injection are higher than their regular cancer cell controls when 10,
100 and 1000 regular cells were injected (Fig. 5B) (Table 1). Tumor formation ability was
also determined with a different mouse strain; we examined the tumorigenicity in
NOD.CS17-Prkdc SCID mice. By the 25th day, tumors formed in 3 of 4 mice injected with
a single HEY PGCC; in contrast, a tumor formed in only 1 of 4 mice injected with 10
regular HEY cells, but in 4 of 4 mice injected with 100 and 1,000 regular HEY cells (Table
1). This result is consistent with previous report that multinucleated giant cancer cells are
more tumorigenic than regular cancer cells from a sarcoma cell line model (20).
Immunohistochemical staining of HEY PGCC-derived tumors also demonstrated high
expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK6, and cyclin B as compared with
regular HEY cancer cell-derived tumors (Fig. 5C).

Differentiation into Adipose, Cartilage, and Bone of PGCCs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine whether these PGCCs to differentiate into other cell types, PGCCs cultured with
adipogenesis medium were strongly stained with oil red O (Fig. 6A-b) and strongly
expressed FABP4 (Fig. 6A-d) but not in the regular HEY cells (Fig. 6A-a and -c). We
subcutaneously injected 1×104 PGCCs cultured with adipogenesis medium into nude mice.
Histologic examination showed a large amount of adipose tissue intermixed with the tumor
cells (Fig. 6A-e). Adipose differentiation was confirmed by FABP4 immunohistochemical
staining (Fig. 6A-f), and the human origin of these cells was confirmed by human-specific
vimentin (Fig. 6A-g and -h). Additionally, PGCCs and regular HEY cells were cultured in
chondrogenesis medium. While no morphologic changes were obvious for regular HEY
cells (Fig. 6B-a), PGCCs formed chondrogenic pellets (Fig. 6B-b) which were strongly
stained by Alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff (Fig. 6B-c and -d). The chondrogenic pellets
were injected both subcutaneously near the ribs and percutaneously into the abdominal
cavity. The 5 animals injected subcutaneously were killed and translucent tumor nodules
similar to cartilage were identified near the site of injection (Fig. 6C-a). Four of 5 abdominal
cavity injections resulted in solid tumor formation. Histologic examination revealed osteoid
structures within the tumor tissue (Fig. 6C-b). Osteoid differentiation was confirmed by
Safranin O/fast green staining (Fig. 6C-c). The osteoid tissue was also positive for antieGFP (Fig. 6C-d), confirming the human origin of the bone tissue. Interestingly, 1 of 5
abdominal cavity injection tumor cells formed small, loose tumor bodies of 1–2 mm in
diameter (Fig. 6C-e). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of these loose bodies showed
cartilaginous tissue in the center of the small bodies (Fig. 6C-f and -g). This tissue was
positive for osteopontin (Fig. 6C-h), demonstrating that PGCCs can differentiate into
cartilage and bone.
MDA-MB-231 PGCCs also formed chondrogenic pellets when cultured with
chondrogenesis medium (Fig. 6D-a), which were strongly stained by Alcian blue and
periodic acid-Schiff (Fig. 6D-b and -c). When the chondrogenic pellets were injected into
the body cavity, small, loose tumor bodies formed (Fig. 6D-d); chondrogenic pellets injected
subcutaneously into nude mice developed tumors with calcification, as confirmed with
computed tomography and HE staining (Fig. 6D-e and -f). The PGCCs cultured in
chondrogenesis medium differentiation into cartilage and bone was demonstrated by
osteopontin immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6D-g). Adipose tissue appeared in the
center of those free, small tumor bodies, of which the human origin was confirmed by
human-specific vimentin immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6D-h).
Relationship between the number of PGCCs and resistance to CoCl2 or Cisplatin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We primarily cultured tumors derived from single PGCC injection. Compared with regular
HEY cells, there was a marked increase in the total number of PGCCs, which survived the
treatment of 300 μM CoCl2 (Fig. S4A). We treated regular HEY cells and PGCCs enriched
by CoCl2 with 10 μg/ml cisplatin for 48 hours. Almost all the control HEY cells died, but
CoCl2 enriched PGCCs survived (Fig. S4B). Furthermore, we examined 5 cases of ovarian
cancer before and after chemotherapy. The number and the size variations of PGCCs were
markedly increased in post-chemotherapy samples than in pre-chemotherapy samples for all
five cases of human ovarian cancer (Fig. S4C).
PGCCs in Human Ovarian Cancer
To validate our findings in human cancer, we examined the existence of PGCCs in benign
and malignant ovarian cancer. PGCCs were observed in serous cystadenoma, high-grade
serous ovarian carcinoma, and metastatic high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Fig. 7A).
The number of PGCCs clearly increases with increased stage and tumor grade. A case of
high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with the PGCCs indicated by arrow (Fig. 7B-a) was

primarily cultured. One representative picture of PGCCs and regular cancer cells from the
primary culture is shown in figure 7B-b. These PGCCs generated daughter cells via burst
over an 11-day period observation (Figure S5). To determine the tumorigenic properties of
PGCCs in this primary ovarian cancer, 50 PGCCs were injected into the subcutis of nude
mice; tumor formation was detected 3 months after injection. When the xenograft was
primarily cultured, the PGCCs (large arrows) and regular cancer cells with (small arrows)
can be observed (Fig. 7B-c). After CoCl2 selectively killed the regular cancer cells, the
recovered PGCCs have numerous small branches (small arrow) (Fig. 7B-d) with distinct
nuclei indicated by Hoechst33342 staining (Fig. 7B -e). When cultured in stem cell medium,
the PGCCs grew as tumor spheroids (Fig. 7B-f) with multiple small cancer cells budding
from these spheroids (arrows).
Clinicopathologic Significances of Cyclin B1 Expression in Human Ovarian Serous Cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As described above, multiple cell cycle-related proteins are dysregulated in PGCCs-derived
tumor. We examined the expression of cyclin B1, a cell cycle regulatory protein involved in
G2/M transition of mitosis. No expression of cyclin B1 was detected in benign ovarian
serous cystadenoma (Fig. 7C-a) and weak nuclear expression in low-grade serous ovarian
cancer (Fig. 7C-b). However, cyclin B1 was expressed only in the cytoplasm of PGCCs
from human high-grade serous carcinoma (Fig. 7C-c) and metastatic ovarian cancer (Fig.
7C-d). Statistical analysis of cyclin B1 immunohistochemical staining showed that high
expression of cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm is associated with both high-grade (P = 0.028) and
late-FIGO stage (P = 0.000) in 250 cases of serous ovarian cancers (Table 2). These results
strongly suggest that cyclin B play an important role in regulating the formation of PGCCs
and regulate the tumor aggressiveness through its re-compartmentalization.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We report here the successful purification, induction and culture of PGCCs cells and
characterization of their biologic properties. These PGCCs generated daughter cells via
asymmetric division, formed spheroids, and were positive for multiple cancer stem cell
markers. Although it remains to be determined whether PGCCs induced by CoCl2 are same
as the PGCCs observed physiologic hypoxia in vivo, the PGCCs induced by CoCl2 are
stable and easy to passage under the described culture condition and provide an advantage
over the physiologic hypoxia in order to have “stable” PGCCs to characterize their biologic
properties. PGCCs are able to generate daughter cells in vitro and were more tumorigenic
than regular differentiated cells in nude mice. Furthermore, the PGCCs possessed a
mesenchymal phenotype and could be induced into multiple benign lineages such as adipose
tissue, bone, and cartilage, suggesting that these PGCCs gained a cancer stem cell-like
properties
Mitosis is the recognized manner of cell division in eukaryotic cells that ensures the accurate
distribution of duplicated genetic materials to progeny cells (21, 22). In prokaryotes and
unicellular eukaryotes, cells divide by amitotic processes, including branching followed by
binary fission and budding. Although mitosis prevails in complex eukaryotes, it has been
well documented that variations of the mitotic cell cycle can occur and meet growth and
developmental needs under stresses (13). Among these variations is the endocycle (or
endoreduplication), a variation of the normal mitotic cell cycle involving multiple rounds of
DNA replication without an intervening mitosis step. This process is an evolutionarily
conserved means of generating multinucleated cells and is commonly employed in certain
forms of growth in plants, insects, and trophoblasts (13, 23). Stress, aging (24), and an
abortive cell cycle can also contribute to the generation of PGCCs. In cancer, certain antimitotic chemotherapy drugs increase the formation of giant cells, which are often considered

to be at the stage of mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis (25), very little attention
was paid to whether PGCCs can survive these treatment and become resistant cancer cells.
PGCCs can generate daughter cells through budding, splitting, and bursting; these growth
patterns are very different from the traditional mitotic growth of eukaryotic diploid cells.
PGCCs use these evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for renewal and fast reproduction.
Therefore, PGCCs may use an evolutional conserved mechanisms used in unicellular
organisms to achieve the fast growth and resistance to chemotherapy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The giant cells revert to regular-sized cancer cells through a process of reduction division
called neosis or depolyploidization by previous investigators (26–28). The neosis or
reductive cell division through meiosis-like depolyploidization from giant cancer cells (28)
was proposed to explain this unexpected life cycle of these cells (29, 30). Overall, despite
these previous reports in the literature (26–31), PGCCs have not attracted much attention in
the cancer research community. Their role in tumorigenesis has not been vigorously tested.
As PGCCs are present in almost all human cancers, their formation may represent an
evolutionarily conserved ancient mechanism that cancer cells use in response to stress and
cancer chemotherapy. First, giant cells are flexible to meet tumor developmental needs.
Second, PGCCs contain multiple copies of genes, which give PGCCs ability to generate the
function of different cell type via epigenetic change and DNA recombination. Thirdly,
PGCCs may have different metabolic processes from different cancer cells (13). These
changes allow PGCCs to be more adaptable to stress and hypoxic microenvironments.
Lastly, the ability of PGCCs to release progeny cells by efficient processes such as budding
or bursting is similar to the mechanisms used to release matured platelets and shedding
progeny viruses in an infected host cell (32, 33). Thus, PGCCs have a distinct advantage
over diploid cancer cells and can be more resistant to hypoxia and other stresses (34). Taken
together, our data suggest that PGCCs represent a novel form of stress-induced cancer cell
with unique cell life cycle that can actively contribute to the tumor growth, heterogeneity,
epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, and chemoresistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Culture
The human ovarian cancer cell lines HEY and SKOv3 were previously described by our
laboratory (35). The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. HEY and SKOv3 were maintained in Eagle’s minimum
essential medium (EMEM), and MDA-MB-231 was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/
ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Induction and Maintenance of PGCCs
The cell lines were cultured in complete medium until the cells reached 90% confluence.
Different concentrations of CoCl2 were added into the flasks and the cells were cultured for
different time points. The concentration of CoCl2 and the time was dependent on the overall
condition of different cell lines (Table S2). After CoCl2 treatment, almost all regular-sized
cells were dead, and several purified PGCCs survived and recovered.
Flow Cytometry
The cell cycle status was detected by flow cytometry using a protocol described previously
(36) and analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

X chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A CEP X SpectrumOrange Direct Labeled Fluorescent DNA Probe Kit and the probe
specific for the X chromosome were purchased from Vysis (Abbott Molecular Inc.). The
fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Acidic β-Galactosidase Staining
Staining for β-galatosidase was done according to a previously published protocol (37).
PKH26 Staining and Animal Injection
The PGCCs were stained with PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each PGCC stained with PKH26 was monitored for its division pattern in a
tissue culture dish every 12 hours. In vivo, 3000 PGCCs stained with PKH26 were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice. The mice were killed on day 28 after injection, and the
frozen sections of tumor were observed for fluorescence from the PKH26-stained cells.
Formation of Spheroids

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stem cell medium (GIBCO/Invitrogen) was used to grow spheroids. The PGCCs were
cultured in stem cell medium for 7–10 days; the PGCCs grew as spheroids either floating in
the medium or attached to the wall of the flask. For growth of spheroids in Matrigel (no.
356237; BD Biosciences), PGCCs were mixed with Matrigel and with complete EMEM at a
1:1 ratio in a total volume of 200 μl on 24-well plate. This cell-Matrigel mixture was
allowed to solidify at 37°C for 10 minutes before 0.5 ml of culture medium was added.
Observation of DNA Transport in the Branches of PGCCs
The PGCCs were trypsinized and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (H342, no. B2261, Sigma)
at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml at 37°C for 1 hour. After rinsed with PBS twice to
remove the dye and wrapped with foil, the PGCCs were cultured with complete EMEM.
Cell division patterns and DNA transportation via the PGCCs’ branches were examined and
photographed 8 hours later.
Generation of PGCCs via Cell Fusion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The regular HEY and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression
vector for eGFP or RFP, and cells with green or red fluorescence were selected and
expanded for the cell fusion experiment. Regular HEY cells were also labeled with PKH26.
To generate PGCCs, regular HEY cancer cells expressing eGFP were mixed with regular
HEY cells labeled with PKH26 or labeled with RFP and then treated with 300 μM CoCl2 for
72 hours. The cell fusion and the formation of PGCCs as indicated by the presence of yellow
fluorescence were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE 2000-U; Nikon).
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence Staining
The detail protocol of immunofluorescence staining was described previously (35). For
information on primary antibodies, see Table S3.
PGCCs Isolation from Primary Cultures of Human Ovarian Cancer
Fresh ovarian cancer tissues were collected according to a protocol approved by our
institutional review board. The samples were washed with PBS and sterilized with
antibiotics. The tissue was minced into 1- to 2-mm3 pieces and cultured with DMEM. The
PGCCs were isolated with cloning cylinders (Sigma) and used for injection into nude mice.

Tumor Growth in Mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Single spheroids or PGCCs together with the mixture of 0.1 ml of PBS buffer and 0.1 ml of
Matrigel were drawn into the syringes and kept in ice before injection. Single PGCCs were
isolated by serial dilution. Each mouse received whole-body radiation before injection.
Single PGCCs were then picked out by pipette and subcutaneously injected into the flanks
of nude and NOD.CS17-Prkdc SCID mice. The mice were killed and their tumors removed
when the mean tumor diameter reached 0.5–1.0 cm. The care and use of the mice was
approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cyclin B expression and Clinicopathologic Correlation in Human Ovarian Cancer
Tumor sample collection and tissue microarray construction have been described previously
(39). 250 cases of serous ovarian carcinoma were used for clinicopathologic data analysis.
All the patients were diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma and had undergone initial surgery
between 30 March 1987 and 17 February 2009. Follow-up information was updated through
31 December 2011. Tumor were graded on a two-tier system (4). Disease staging was
according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging
system (40). Based on the cutoff point for the score of cyclin B1 expression to reach
statistical significance using X-tile software, the staining scores were defined as low
expression, for those < 25% cyclin B1-positive tumor cells, and high expression, for those
25% cyclin B1-positive tumor cells (42). The use of tissue blocks and the chart reviews were
approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.
Statistical Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the clinicopathologic significances of cyclin B1
expression in the cytoplasm. A P-value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically
significant. Data was analyzed using STATA 9.0 (Stats Corporation, College Station, TX,
USA). All statistical tests were 2-sided.
