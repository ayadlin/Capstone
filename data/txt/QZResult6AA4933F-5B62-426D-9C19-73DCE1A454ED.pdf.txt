Abstract
Brachytherapy is a common clinical technique involving implantation of sealed radioactive "seeds" within a
tumor to selectively irradiate the tumor mass while minimizing systemic toxicity. To mitigate the disadvantages
associated with complex surgical implantation and subsequent device removal procedures, we have developed an
alternative approach using a genetically encoded peptide polymer solution composed of a thermally responsive
elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) radiolabeled with 131I that self-assembles into radionuclide seeds upon intratumoral injection. The formation of these nontoxic and biodegradable polymer seeds led to prolonged intratumoral
retention (85% ID/tumor 7 days postinjection) of the radionuclide, elicited a tumor growth delay in 100% of the
tumors in two human xenografts (FaDu and PC-3), and cured more than 67% of tumor-bearing animals after a
single administration of labeled ELP. These results suggest that in situ self-assembly of biodegradable and
injectable radionuclide-containing polypeptide seeds could be a promising therapeutic alternative to conventional brachytherapy. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5956–65. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Brachytherapy is a clinical technique that is typically used in
the treatment of prostate cancer and other malignancies to
selectively expose a tumor to large doses of beta and gamma
radiation via locally implanted "seeds" (1). The strategic placement of these seeds throughout the tumor mass can provide
prolonged irradiation to the tumor while limiting the radiation
burden on healthy tissues. Although the success of current
approaches to prostate brachytherapy is exempliﬁed by excellent disease-free survival (2–4), its implementation is plagued
by a number of signiﬁcant limitations, including the need for
general anesthesia, complicated placement procedures, seed
migration to other organs, and the need for posttreatment
excision for seed removal (5). We speculated that many of these
limitations might be overcome by engineering a biodegradable
material that (i) can form injectable depots with a life span in
vivo that is compatible with the half-life of the radionuclide
used for treatment and (ii) degrades into nontoxic products
that are resorbed by the body after the radioactivity has
decayed to a level that no longer poses a threat of systemic

toxicity, thereby obviating the need for surgical implantation
and reexcision. Although various polymers have been designed
and evaluated with these requirements in mind, issues such as
toxicity, biologic incompatibility, a lack of injectability and the
less ability to scale-up manufacturing continue to hinder their
clinical implementation (6–9).
Elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) are a unique class of genetically engineered peptide polymers that have several attractive
properties for brachytherapy. First, ELPs undergo phase separation in response to small temperature changes. ELPs
remain highly soluble in aqueous solution below a characteristic transition temperature (Tt), but within seconds, desolvate
into a hydrophobic coacervate above the Tt. This temperature
is tunable by adjusting the amino acid composition, molecular
weight (MW), and concentration of the ELP (10–12). The ability
to tune the behavior at the molecular level allows for the facile
design of ELPs that can serve as an injectable depot for
radioactivity or other drugs. Second, ELPs are biodegradable,
biocompatible, and their design at the genetic level enables
facile addition of functional groups for radiolabeling (13–15)
and provides exquisite control over the composition and MW
of the peptide. This versatility facilitates the design of ELPs that
are soluble at room temperature but rapidly collapse into a
viscous coacervate upon warming to body temperature. This
feature is attractive for the formation of an injectable depot of
covalently conjugated radionuclide for brachytherapy, as it
avoids the need for surgical placement of the radioactive depot.
In a previous study, the ELP phase transition temperature was
adjusted to drive ELP coacervation immediately following
tumor infusion. The formation of a coacervate phase within
the tumor increased the intratumoral retention of the

radiotherapeutic, thereby enhancing the antitumor efﬁcacy
compared with a thermally insensitive control ELP. However,
this [131I]ELP depot was not able to induce complete tumor
regression (16).
Herein, we engineered an easily injectable radiolabeled ELP
that thermally self-assembles into highly stable, therapeutic
radionuclide seed-like depots in situ upon intratumoral (i.t.)
administration and optimized their in vivo performance. To
optimize the therapeutic efﬁcacy of this new modality, we
investigated the effect of a range of parameters to modulate the
physical properties of the depot, including the ELP MW,
concentration, composition, and the tyrosine-rich peptide
appended to the carboxy-terminus for radiolabeling. By designing a diverse set of injectable ELPs, we show that the temporal
stability of the radioactive depot in vivo can be tuned by
controlling the phase transition temperature of the radionuclide carrier and present evidence of the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
this engineered thermally responsive biomaterial. The optimized seed-like depot displays prolonged intratumoral retention and exhibits potent antitumor efﬁcacy, and eventually
degrades into nontoxic peptides.

Materials and Methods
ELP design and synthesis
A thermally responsive ELP composed of tandem repeats of
the pentapeptide motif VPGVG was designed to transition
below 30 C to enable immediate coacervation upon intratumoral infusion within the concentration range of 62.5 to 1,000
mmol/L. To evaluate the effect of MW on tumor retention,
synthetic genes encoding 3 ELPs spanning a range of MWs
were synthesized using PRe-RDL (17). These 3 ELPs, consisting
of 60 pentapeptides (25 kDa), 120 pentapeptides (50 kDa), and
240 pentapeptides (100 kDa), are referred to as ELP60, ELP120,
and ELP240, respectively. ELP60 and ELP240 included a single
tyrosine residue at the C-terminus, and are referred to as ELP60
-Tyr1, and ELP240-Tyr1. ELP120 was modiﬁed to include 1, 4, or 7
tyrosine residues at the C-terminus, and these are referred to as
ELP120-Tyr1, ELP120-Tyr4, and ELP120-Tyr7, respectively. Synthetic genes encoding these ELPs were inserted into pET-24a
(þ) expression vectors and transformed into BL21 Escherichia
coli chemically competent cells (Edge BioSystems). Transformed cells were used to inoculate one liter of TB-Dry
media (Mo Bio) in a 4-liter ﬂask, which was supplemented
with 45 mg/mL kanamycin and incubated for 24 hours at 37 C
and 200 rpm. ELP was puriﬁed using inverse transition cycling
(ITC; ref. 18), a nonchromatographic method that exploits the
ELP thermal transition to sequentially remove soluble and
insoluble impurities through centrifugation. ITC also enables
the recovery of ELP at high yields with endotoxin levels that are
below the FDA required limit of 5 EU/dose (1 dose ¼ 1 mg). The
ELP thermal properties were characterized by monitoring the
optical density of the ELP solution at 350 nm as a function of
temperature (1 C/min) on a temperature-controlled UV-Vis
spectrophotometer (Cary 300 Bio; Varian instruments).
Radioiodination of ELP
ELPs with carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues were labeled
with either 125I or 131I (PerkinElmer) using the IODO-Gen kit

www.aacrjournals.org

(GE Healthcare). Brieﬂy, 100 mL of ELP at a speciﬁed concentration in PBS was applied to an IODO-Gen precoated tube
containing 2 mCi Na 125I (for tumor retention and biodistribution studies) or 20 mCi Na 131I (for radiotherapy studies), and
the reaction product was puriﬁed by size-exclusion chromatography with a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). The radioactivity was quantiﬁed by counting an aliquot on a g-counter
(LKB-Wallac). The concentration of iodinated ELP was measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientiﬁc) at a
wavelength of 280 nm. The ﬁnal radioactivity and molar
concentration of ELP was adjusted by mixing labeled and
unlabeled ELPs to achieve the desired injection concentration
and dose. The radioactive dose of [125I]ELPs for tumor retention studies was 10 mCi 125I/40 mL of ELP with a speciﬁc
radioactivity of 6 to 12 mCi/mg, whereas for biodistribution
studies the dose was 3 mCi 125I/40 mL of ELP at 1,000 mmol/L
with a speciﬁc radioactivity of 1 to 2 mCi/mg. To assess
therapeutic efﬁcacy, we used [131I]ELPs at 1,000 to 2,000 mCi
131
I/40 mL of 1,000 mmol/L ELP with a speciﬁc radioactivity of
7,500 to 15,000 mCi/mg.
Animal implantation of tumor subcutaneous xenografts
Female nude mice (Balb/c, nu/nu) with an average body
weight of 20 g were provided by the Duke Comprehensive
Cancer Facility Isolated Facility for all in vivo experiments,
including ELP tumor retention, biodistribution, and [131I]ELP
radiotherapy. The mice were housed in isolated caging with
sterile rodent food, acidiﬁed water ad libitum, and a 12-hour
light/dark cycle. The FaDu head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and maintained by Duke University Cell
Culture Facility. PC-3M-luciferase gene (luc2), which is a
derivative of the PC-3 cell line, is a luciferase-expressing
metastatic prostate cancer cell line that was stably transfected
with ﬁreﬂy luc2 (Caliper Life Science). Both cell lines were
authenticated by STR-DNA technology (RADIL) by Duke University Cell Culture Facility, and Caliper Life Science, respectively, when we bought them and started cell culture for this
study in our laboratory. The 2 tumor cell lines were cultured as
monolayers in tissue culture ﬂasks. The culture medium contained minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FBS and a 1% antibiotic/antimycotic
solution (Invitrogen). The cultures were maintained at 37 C
under 5% CO2. Leg tumor xenografts were established by
subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation of 1  106 cells in 30 mL of
MEM medium in the right lower leg of each mouse. Tumors
were allowed to grow for 7 to 9 (FaDu) or 11 to 13 (PC-3) days
before treatment until they reached a size of 150  20 mm3.
Mice were monitored for general well being, weight, and tumor
volume. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee regulations.
Tumor retention of ELP conjugates
To investigate the effect of the injected concentration,
MW, and tyrosine content on the tumor retention of ELP, 3
retention experiments were conducted, varying: (i) the
injection concentration of ELP120-Tyr1 (62.5, 125, 250, 500,

and 1,000 mmol/L); (ii) MW of the ELPs (ELP60-Tyr1, 25 kDa;
ELP120-Tyr1, 50 kDa; and ELP240-Tyr1, 100 kDa); and (iii) the
tyrosine content at the C-terminus of ELP120 at an injection
concentration of 250 mmol/L (ELP120-Tyr1, ELP120-Tyr4, and
ELP120-Tyr7). Each ELP was infused into the tumor using a
syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) at a rate of 120 mL/min in
a volume of 40 mL into a 150 mm3 tumor. The radioactivity
retained in the mice was monitored with a dose calibrator
(Biodex Medical Systems) at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours.

calculated and expressed as the relative tumor volume compared with day 0 (i.e., fold change). Median values were used
instead of the mean because some tumors regressed completely. Animals were humanely killed once any of the following end
points were reached in the course of the radiotherapy: the
tumor size reached 5 times the initial tumor volume, the tumor
volume reached 1 cm3, the body weight dropped below 85% of
the body weight, or 60 days posttreatment (the end of the
experiment).

Rheological characterization
The ELP viscosity in PBS was measured on an AR G2
rheometer (TA Instruments) with a concentric cylinder. An
ELP solution in PBS was loaded onto a preheated cylinder
(35 C), the samples were compressed to a height of 55 mm and
allowed to equilibrate for 2 minutes at 35 C. Steady shear
measurements were conducted over a range of shear rate
between approximately 103 and approximately 103 per
second.

Safety evaluation of ELPs
The safety evaluation of the ELP radionuclide depot was
examined through 2 experiments: (i) the radioiodine toxicity
during radiotherapy was evaluated by monitoring clinical signs
of health and changes in body weight and (ii) the organ and
tissue toxicity was examined by measuring the biodistribution
of [125I]ELP120-Tyr7 after i.t. administration in nude mice
bearing FaDu tumors. Six mice were sacriﬁced at predetermined time points, their organs (blood, thyroid, lungs, heart,
liver, spleen, kidneys, and tumor) were collected, and the
radioactivity levels were measured with a g-counter. The
accumulated radioactivity was presented as injected dose per
gram (%ID/g).

Dynamic light scattering
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was conducted on ELP120
-Tyr1, ELP120-Tyr4, and ELP120-Tyr7 using a thermally controlled Wyatt Plate Reader (Wyatt Technology) to determine
the hydrodynamic radius (Rh). The samples were diluted to 50
mmol/L in PBS, ﬁltered through a 0.1 mm Anotop syringe ﬁlter
(Whatman), and 35 mL of each solution was placed into a well of
a 384-well plate (Corning). Small drops of mineral oil were
added to the top of each well to prevent evaporation. Each
sample was analyzed with eighteen 10 second acquisitions at
15 C, which was below the transition temperature for these
ELP. The resulting data were ﬁt using a Rayleigh sphere model
with a regularization algorithm. Populations comprising less
than 3% of the total mass were excluded from analysis.
Tumor retention and therapeutic efﬁcacy of [131I]ELPs
The effect of increased tyrosine content on the in vivo
tumor retention and antitumor efﬁcacy of [131I]ELP was examined in a s.c. FaDu tumor model by i.t. administration of the
following ELP solutions: [131I]ELP120-Tyr1, [131I]ELP120-Tyr4,
and [131I]ELP120-Tyr7 at an ELP concentration of 1,000
mmol/L and a total radioactivity dose of 2,000 mCi into a 150
mm3 tumor. The in vivo retention and antitumor efﬁcacy of
[131I]ELP120-Tyr7 was also examined in subcutaneous human
prostate PC-3M-luc2 xenografts in nude mice. Both tumors
were compared with an unlabeled ELP control, also administered at 1,000 mmol/L. To prevent thyroid accumulation of free
radioiodine, 1% potassium iodide was added to the drinking
water of all of the animals one week before treatment and
continued till the end of the radiotherapy experiment. The
mice were monitored daily for tumor radioactivity, tumor
volume, body weight, and survival during the ﬁrst week, every
other day during the ﬁrst month, and twice a week thereafter.
The tumor radioactivity proﬁle was monitored with dose
calibrator after i.t. injection of [131I]ELP until the level fell
below 5% of the administered level in each mouse. The tumor
volume was determined by the equation: volume ¼ (width)2 
length  p/6. The mean tumor growth over time per group was

Histologic studies and tumor autoradiography
On days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 60 after i.t. infusion of [131I]ELP, the
animals were killed, and the tumor tissue was collected and
ﬁxed in 10% formalin. The formalin-ﬁxed FaDu and PC-3 tumor
tissue was then embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned (5 mm), and
stained with hematoxylin eosin. Tumor necrosis in both treatment and control groups was analyzed by light microscopy.
Unstained tumor sections from the same set of samples were
exposed to a storage phosphor screen (PerkinElmer) for 4 to 5
days, which was then scanned with a Cyclone storage Phosphor
(PerkinElmer)
Statistical methods
Tumor retention data of [125I]ELP and tumor growth data for
[131I]ELP were analyzed by 1-factor ANOVA analysis stratiﬁed
by treatment group, which was followed by the Bonferroni t test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant in both cases.
Statistical differences between survival rates of the animals
were determined by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The cumulative
radioactivity and half-life of tumor radioactivity were analyzed
with PK Solution 2.0 (Summit Research Services).

Results
Modulation of the phase transition behavior enables
prolonged intratumoral retention
To promote intratumoral retention, each ELP was designed
to form highly localized insoluble depots—analogous to
seeds—at the temperature of subcutaneous tumors in anesthetized mice (31.7 C). The Tt of each ELP satisﬁes this
criterion under all examined conditions, including changes in
concentration, MW, and tyrosine content (Supplementary
Table S1). The injected ELP is expected to remain assembled
in a localized seed until its degradation and alternatively
clearance by diffusion.

Development of an Injectable Modality for Brachytherapy

To determine the relationship between tumor retention and
the physical properties of the ELP, concentration, MW, and
tyrosine content were systematically varied. First, the effect of
concentration was examined on the in vitro Tt and in vivo
tumor retention of ELP120-Tyr1 over a series of 2-fold dilutions
(1,000–62.5 mmol/L). Although the Tt decreased 3 C over this
16-fold increase in concentration, the in vivo tumor retention 7
days following intratumoral infusion exhibited a 5-fold
increase from 16% at 62.5 mmol/L to 85% at 1,000 mmol/L
(P < 0.01; Supplemental Table S1). These results indicate that
higher concentrations could provide a signiﬁcant increase in
antitumor efﬁcacy by increasing the tumor retention time of
radioiodine.
Second, the effect of the ELP MW on the in vitro Tt and in vivo
tumor retention of the ELP seeds was examined using ELP60
-Tyr1 (25 kDa), ELP120-Tyr1 (50 kDa), and ELP240-Tyr1 (100
kDa). The ELP Tt exhibited a 4 C decrease as the MW increased
from 25 to 50 kDa; this effect also translated to higher tumor
retention, which showed a 14-fold increase 7 days following
infusion (P < 0.01). However, further increasing ELP MW to 100
kDa (ELP240-Tyr1) only reduced the Tt by an additional 0.5 C
and failed to generate a signiﬁcant increase in tumor retention
from ELP120-Tyr1 to ELP240-Tyr1 (Supplemental Table S1).
These results also suggest that the ELP Tt plays an important
role in tumor retention. Thus, ELP120-Tyr1 (50 kDa) was
selected for further characterization because it provided prolonged tumor retention while reducing the amount of ELP that
must be administered.
Finally, we examined the effect of the number of tyrosine
residues in the ELP on its tumor retention. It is generally
understood that the ELP phase transition depends on the
hydrophobicity of the sequence; as the hydrophobicity of the
ELP increases, the Tt decreases (19). However, instead of
altering the ELP sequence, a hydrophobic tyrosine-rich peptide
was appended to the C-terminus to provide reactive sites
for radioiodination as well as to decrease the Tt. As expected,
the Tt of the ELPs decreased as a function of tyrosine content:
ELP120-Tyr1 (24.97 C), ELP120-Tyr4 (23.22 C), and ELP120-Tyr7
(20.57 C) all followed this trend. This reduction in the Tt caused
a signiﬁcant increase in the tumor retention of the seed, with
each addition of 3 tyrosine residues inducing a 1.5- to 2-fold
increase in tumor retention and a 2.5 C reduction in the
Tt (P < 0.01; Supplemental Table S1). Correlation analysis
of the tumor retention experiments showed that each of
the 3 factors plays a critical role in the Tt: ELP concentration
(r2 ¼ 0.983), ELP MW (r2 ¼ 0.998), and tyrosine content
(r2 ¼ 0.961; Fig. 1A).
The tyrosine content also affected ELP viscosity; ELPs with
greater numbers of tyrosine residues exhibited a higher viscosity than those with fewer residues (Fig. 1B). This behavior
may be partially explained by the presence of 36.9  12.4 nm
micelles in the ELP120-Tyr7 sample. Unlike ELP120-Tyr1 and
ELP120-Tyr4 samples that solely consist of soluble unimers
(Rh  6 nm), the ELP120-Tyr7 population was equally distributed between a unimeric state and a nanoparticle state as seen
by DLS (Fig. 1C). This suggests that when the nanoaggregates
are heated to body temperature, the ELP coacervate that is
formed contains a signiﬁcant fraction of aggregated micelles,

leading to a different internal microstructure than the other 2

ﬁne tuning the molecular architecture of ELPs and illustrate

the many tools available for easily modulating intratumoral
retention.
Long-lasting radiolabeled seeds lead to complete tumor
regression
Tumor retention studies show that the 50 kDa ELP (ELP120)
administered at 1,000 mmol/L promotes the formation of
long-lasting seeds. Furthermore, increased tyrosine content
was also shown to enhance tumor retention and thus the
cumulative tumor exposure to radioactivity (Supplementary
Table S1). Hence, to evaluate whether increased tumor retention translates into a therapeutic advantage, we investigated
the tumor retention and antitumor effects of [131I]ELP120
containing 1 (ELP120-Tyr1), 4 (ELP120-Tyr4), and 7 tyrosines
(ELP120-Tyr7) per molecule at an injection concentration of
1,000 mmol/L. Figure 2A shows that the temperature-triggered
formation of an ELP seed containing 7 tyrosines most effectively retained the radioactive payload within the tumor mass.
Correspondingly, the antitumor efﬁcacy and survival time of

the mice correlated with tumor retention, with ELP120-Tyr7
displaying the best therapeutic outcome, followed by ELP120
-Tyr4 and ELP120-Tyr1 (Fig. 2B and C). The ELP120-Tyr7
seed exhibited much better antitumor efﬁcacy than either
ELP120-Tyr1 or ELP120-Tyr4 and displayed the longest median
survival time (60 days vs. 39 and 17 days, respectively). In the
ELP120-Tyr7 treatment group, 10/12 mice survived until the
end of the study (60 days), and 8/12 tumors showed complete
regression. In contrast, all of the animals in the control ELP
group, 6/7 mice treated with ELP120-Tyr1, and 6/8 mice
treated with ELP120-Tyr4 were euthanized before the end of
the study due because of either excessive tumor size
(>1 cm3; Table 1) or body weight loss (>15%) because of
tumor burden. Histologic examination illustrated that this
radiation damage manifested as an acute inﬂammatory reaction (inﬁltration of white blood cells and congestion of blood
vessels) in the tumor tissue at 24 hours (Fig. 2E) compared
with that before treatment (Fig. 2D), and the initiation of cell
death at 48 hours (Fig. 2F) following administration. By 72

hours, the tumor cell outline had disappeared (Fig. 2G).
However, tumor shrinkage was not observed until 5 days
posttreatment (Fig. 2B).
The antitumor efﬁcacy of these ELP seeds was also examined in PC-3 human prostate carcinoma xenografts. Both the
tumor retention and the antitumor efﬁcacy results for the PC-3
xenografts (Fig. 3A–E) were comparable to those observed in
the FaDu line (Table 1). In both tumor lines, [131I]ELP120-Tyr7
promoted prolonged tumor retention of 131I activity as measured by the area under the curve (cumulative radioactivity),
half-life of tumor radioactivity (Table 1) and suppressed tumor
growth. Moreover, this treatment signiﬁcantly prolonged the
survival of mice bearing PC-3, whereas 10/10 of the control
mice with PC-3 tumors died within 35 days and 13/13 of the
treated mice survived until the end of the 60-day study.
Histologic examination of PC-3 tumors from these long-term
survivors showed that the ELP seeds eliminated all of the
tumor cells remaining at the tumor site (Fig. 3G and I), whereas
the control ELPs permitted tumor growth and ﬁbrosis (Fig. 3F
and H). These results show that this locally infused, selfassembled seed has signiﬁcant therapeutic effect against 2
different human tumor lines.
The biodegradable radioactive seeds show minimal
toxicity in mice
To address the concern that the biodegradability of these
seeds and egress of labeled catabolites from tumor could lead
to excessive radiation exposure of normal tissues, we monitored the overall health of the mice receiving therapy-level
doses through body weight measurements. In addition, the
biodistribution of the ELP following i.t. injection was assessed.
During the course of radiotherapy, none of the animals in
either tumor model exhibited signiﬁcant clinical signs of
toxicity The treatment of FaDu xenografts with 2,000 mCi
[131I]ELP120-Tyr7, for instance, showed a maximum body
weight loss of 4% (Fig. 4A); generally, a 15% reduction in body
weight is accepted before the mouse must be euthanized for
humane reasons. Body weight loss in the mice bearing the PC-3

xenograft, however, was more severe, as the maximum body
weight loss reached a plateau of 14% on day 15, gradually
improving to normal levels over the following 2 weeks (Fig. 4B).
However, this toxicity was not primarily caused by the ELP
seed, but rather by the PC-3 tumor. Mice bearing the PC-3
tumor displayed greater than 10% weight loss in the absence of
treatment (data not shown). The biodistribution results further
show that after i.t. administration of this radiotherapeutic
depot, clearance of radioiodine from normal tissues was rapid,
with the result that by 24 hours, activity levels were less than 1%
ID/g in all tissues studied including the thyroid (Fig. 4C).
Autoradiography of the tumor following [131I]ELP120-Tyr7 infusion illustrate that the 131I activity was concentrated primarily
at the administration site located in the center of the tumor
(Fig. 4E), and its distribution pattern matched the area of
tumor necrosis seen in the histologic tumor section (Fig. 4D).
These results show that the [131I]ELP120-Tyr7 radioactivity was
mainly restricted to the tumor, and indicate that the systematic
optimization of this local drug delivery depot signiﬁcantly
improved antitumor efﬁcacy and lowered systemic toxicity.

Discussion
In this study, we developed an alternative modality to
conventional brachytherapy consisting of a biodegradable,
genetically engineered polypeptide conjugated to a therapeutic
radioisotope that spontaneously transitions from an easily
infusible liquid into a seed-like depot upon injection into a
solid tumor. We observed that the integrity and efﬁcacy of this
depot correlated with the number of tyrosines in its C-terminus
tail, overall MW, and solution concentration, and showed that
these spontaneously assembled seeds are effective against 2
human tumor xenografts in athymic mice. We hypothesized
that the physicochemical and structural properties of the
polypeptide seeds could be altered to maximize depot retention and efﬁcacy.
To investigate this hypothesis, we recombinantly synthesized a series of polypeptides, prepared ELP-radionuclide
conjugates, and investigated the effect of polypeptide MW,

amino acid composition, and injection concentration—the
three main parameters controlling their phase transition
behavior—on the stability of the depot. Interestingly, we found
that each parameter played an important role. Increasing the
injection concentration and increasing the number of tyrosines in the sequence increased tumor retention half-life.
Increasing the MW also increased tumor retention, though
only up to a point; doubling the MW from 50 to 100 kDa did not
result in a further increase in seed stability. Importantly, the
increased retention time directly correlated with the DTt,
deﬁned as the difference between the transition temperature
of the ELP under these speciﬁc conditions and the intratumoral temperature. We hypothesized that by using these
parameters to drive the absolute transition temperature lower—thereby increasing the DTt—we effectively increase seed
stability by altering 2 molecular parameters: viscosity and
internal microstructure. We have 2 lines of evidence suggesting

5962

Cancer Res; 72(22) November 15, 2012

that viscosity and the internal microstructure are important.
The ﬁrst is that the most successful depot, ELP120-Tyr7, also
exhibits the highest viscosity (Fig. 1B). The markedly different viscoelastic behavior of this depot compared with the 2
other ELPs studied herein is probably related to the fact that
its internal microstructure is quite different from the other 2
ELP depots. The second piece of evidence was revealed by
DLS: ELP120-Tyr7 forms spherical micelles at temperatures
below its coacervation temperature, unlike ELP120-Tyr1 and
ELP120-Tyr4 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the microstructure of this ELP
seed may consist of aggregated nanoscale micelles, whereas
the other ELP seeds simply consist of entangled polymer
chains with little internal structure. This difference in
microstructure, we believe, is largely responsible for the
stark difference in the temporal retention of the seed within
the tumor, and hence its efﬁcacy in both conﬁning the
radioactivity to the tumor space—thereby limiting systemic

toxicity—and enhancing efﬁcacy via its ability to irradiate
the tumor from the inside out.
Given that this spontaneously formed seed was stable for
prolonged periods of time, we hypothesized that it could prove
an effective therapeutic for the treatment of tumors in regions
accessible by injection such as the head, neck, breast, brain,
and prostate. This seed-like depot displayed signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy against 2 human tumor xenografts as seen by
the following results: (i) 100% of the tumors responded to
treatment, resulting in a 67% cure rate and (ii) 8/12 mice
bearing FaDu tumors and 13/13 mice bearing PC-3 tumors
survived until the end of the 60-day experiment. The tumor
response was separated into 2 phases, which is typical of
clinical brachytherapy. In the ﬁrst stage (3–5 days posttreatment), the tumor mass was large and rigid, which was likely
because of edema of the tumor tissue. In the second stage,
approximately 3 to 7 days postinfusion, the tumor size

www.aacrjournals.org

decreased and the mass became more pliant. Histologic analysis indicated that this effect was likely because of necrosis
because signiﬁcant tumor tissue destruction in and around the
injection site was observed 72 hours postinfusion of the radiolabeled ELP.
We also examined the toxicity of this system in preliminary
fashion by monitoring body weight of animals receiving
[131I]ELP. Similar to clinical brachytherapy, this modality was
well tolerated by mice implanted with 2 different human tumor
xenografts, suggesting that the therapeutic load was predominantly contained within the tumor. The biodistribution results
showed that only a limited amount of the radioactivity accumulated in important organs (Fig. 4C). Noteworthy, there were
3 forms of radioactivity distributed in the tumor and in normal
organs, including free 131I, free [131I]ELP, and aggregated
[131I]ELP, and each one of these is expected to have a different
elimination pathway. Free 131I is rapidly cleared once released

from the ELP into circulation; free [131I]ELP may be cleared off
at a slower rate as it diffuses away from the ELP depot and
enters systemic circulation. The mechanism of clearance of
these 2 forms may vary depending on its degradation rate and
MW, but our biodistribution data (Fig. 4C) suggests a gradual
excretion process through the kidneys, as indicated by a higher
percentage of the injected dose in the kidneys compared with
other organs at each time point. The toxicity contributed by
this clearance process will only be minor, however, because we
observed that the exposure rapidly dropped below 0.5% ID/g
for all organs after the ﬁrst 24 hours after administration (Fig.
4C). This also allows us to assume in our subsequent analyses
that more than 99% of the detected tumor radioactivity
originates from the aggregated [131I]ELP that constitutes the
major radioactive source in our injectable system. These
encouraging results suggest that this polypeptide seed may
by worthy of further evaluation for several potential applications: (i) to treat patients who are at an early stage (e.g., breast
or prostate) without requiring them to undergo radical surgery;
(ii) to make unresectable tumors operable by debulking their
mass (e.g., tumors near major arteries or organs); and (iii) to
improve the quality of life for patients with advanced tumors
(e.g., lung cancers that obstruct the bronchi).
Despite the efﬁcacy of this procedure, we are currently
investigating methods to further improve its therapeutic
potential. For example, this treatment strategy relies on a
uniform coverage of the entire tumor because the penetration
depth of the selected radionuclide (131I) is only 1 mm. While
this short penetration depth can prevent harmful radiation
from affecting nearby healthy tissues, it can also leave live
tumor cells at the tumor boundaries (20). To improve the
uniformity of the coverage it may be possible to inject multiple
seeds (similar to clinical brachytherapy) to compensate for
large or multifocal tumors or modulate the distance the
infusion solution travels before transitioning into a stable
seed-like depot. Furthermore, providing a second infusion
following the initial response may prevent the tumor reemergence that we observed in a few isolated animals.

In conclusion, we have developed a genetically engineered, thermally responsive peptide polymer that selfassembles into a biodegradable seed upon intratumoral
injection. By modulating the physicochemical and structural
characteristics of the polypeptide, we were able to signiﬁcantly increase the retention time and the antitumor efﬁcacy
of the self-assembled seeds. The intratumoral administration of the seed-like depot led to a 100% response rate and a
more than 67% cure rate in 2 xenograft models after 60 days,
and showed only minimal accumulation (<1%ID/g) in vital
organs. This novel self-assembled seeds are now being
studied in orthotopic animal models to assess its feasibility
as an alternative to brachytherapy seeds.
