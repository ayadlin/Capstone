BACKGROUND: In this phase 2 study, the activity and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab, an inhibitor of
angiogenesis, and everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was evaluated in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Patients with metastatic melanoma who had received up to
2 previous systemic regimens (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy) were eligible. Previous treatment with angiogenesis or mTOR inhibitors was not allowed. All patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously
every 21 days and everolimus at a dose of 10 mg orally daily. Patients were re-evaluated every 6 weeks; those with an
objective response or stable disease (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) continued
therapy until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients with metastatic
melanoma received a median of 4 treatment cycles (range, 1-14þ cycles). Seven patients (12%) achieved major
responses, whereas 33 patients (58%) were found to have stable disease at the time of first evaluation. The median
progression-free and overall survivals were 4 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Approximately 43% of patients
were alive after 12 months of follow-up. The treatment regimen was well tolerated by the majority of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bevacizumab and everolimus was found to have moderate activity and was well
tolerated in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Further exploration of agents with these mechanisms of action is indicated, perhaps in combination with inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)

The incidence of melanoma has increased during the last decade, and currently accounts for approximately 60,000 new
cases and 9000 deaths yearly in the United States.1 Patients who develop metastatic melanoma have a very poor prognosis,
with a median survival of 6 to 8 months and a 5-year survival rate of <5%.
Metastatic melanoma is resistant to most cytotoxic agents. A few agents, such as dacarbazine, temozolomide, and
paclitaxel, are used for palliative treatment, but these agents have response rates of <15% and have minimal impact on the
natural history of the disease.2 As a result, the majority of current clinical research concerning systemic therapy for
advanced melanoma is focused on novel targeted agents.
Overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is common in metastatic melanoma, and
high serum levels of VEGF represent an adverse prognostic feature.3-6 Several angiogenesis inhibitors have demonstrated
single-agent activity, either alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents, and clinical trials of many of these agents are
continuing.7-14 The phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal transduction pathway regulates many basic cellular
properties, including apoptosis resistance, survival, and motility. This pathway is up-regulated, by a variety of mechanisms, in many cancers, including metastatic melanoma. Agents that inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),

including temsirolimus and everolimus, are effective in inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway.15,16 These agents also
result in down-regulation of the VEGF receptor, and may
be useful in combination with other antiangiogenesis
agents. Although mTOR inhibitors have been to reported
to have limited single-agent activity against melanoma,17,18 the combination of temsirolimus with sorafenib demonstrated some activity in a preliminary report.19
In this phase 2 study, we evaluated the activity and
tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab and everolimus in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We recently piloted this combination in the
treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and found
the regimen to be active and well tolerated in patients
with that disease.20

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This multicenter, community-based phase 2 trial was initiated in February 2008. Selected sites in the Sarah Cannon Oncology Research Consortium participated in the
trial (Table 1). Before patients were enrolled, the trial was
approved by the institutional review boards of all participating sites.
Eligibility
To be eligible for this trial, patients were required to have
histologically confirmed, unresectable metastatic melanoma. In addition to those with cutaneous melanomas,

Cancer

September 1, 2010

patients with ocular and mucosal melanomas were eligible. Patients were allowed to have received up to 2 previous chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens.
However, previous treatment with antiangiogenesis agents
or mTOR inhibitors was not allowed. Additional inclusion criteria included measurable disease (using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])21; an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2; adequate bone marrow function
(an absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL and a platelet
count 100,000/lL); serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL; serum bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL; and transaminases 2.5 
the upper limit of normal (or 5  the upper limit of
normal in patients with liver metastases). All patients were
required to provide written informed consent before study
entry.
Patients were excluded if they had central nervous
system involvement by melanoma. In addition, concurrent treatment with drugs known to be inhibitors or
inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes was
not allowed. Additional exclusion criteria included treatment with investigational agents within 4 weeks of study
entry, female patients who were pregnant or lactating,
acute myocardial infarction within 6 months of study
entry, clinically significant cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, class II or greater
congestive heart failure, or serious cardiac arrhythmia),
human immunodeficiency virus infection, and any
impairment of gastrointestinal function that would alter
the absorption or swallowing of oral medications. Specific
exclusion criteria related to bevacizumab included a history of hemoptysis or hematemesis, major surgical procedures within 28 days or minor surgical procedures within
7 days of the initiation of treatment, patients with any
type of gastrostomy tube, a urine protein:creatinine ratio
1.0, and a history of a bleeding diathesis or
coagulopathy.

Pretreatment Evaluation
Before the initiation of therapy, all patients underwent a
complete medical history, physical examination, complete
blood counts, chemistry profile, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, lipid panel, and urinalysis. If
patients were found to have >1þ protein on a urinalysis
dipstick test, either a urine protein:creatinine ratio or a
24-hour urine collection for protein was performed.
Radiologic evaluation included computed tomography
(CT) scan of the chest and abdomen, and either CT or

4123

magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head. Tumor
measurements were performed in all patients before the
beginning of therapy.
Treatment
All patients received treatment with bevacizumab at a
dose of 15 mg/kg, administered by intravenous infusion
on Day 1 of each 21-day course. In addition, all patients
received everolimus at a dose of 10 mg orally on a daily basis. Bevacizumab was infused according to standard guidelines. Everolimus was taken with a whole glass of water by
the patient in a fasting state or after no more than a light,
fat-free meal. No routine premedications were given with
bevacizumab or everolimus.
Before each dose of bevacizumab, patients had complete blood counts and urinalysis performed; a chemistry
profile was performed once every 6 weeks. Patients were
seen and examined by their physicians on Day 1 of each
cycle (every 3 weeks). After 6 weeks of treatment, patients
were evaluated for response. At that time, repeat CT scans
of the chest and abdomen were performed, as well as any
additional scans necessary to include all measurable
lesions. Patients with an objective response to treatment
or stable disease continued to receive bevacizumab and
everolimus. Patients with tumor progression were
removed from the study.
For patients continuing treatment, re-evaluations
were performed at 6-week intervals. Treatment was continued until disease progression occurred or the patient
developed intolerable toxicity.
Dose Modifications
On the basis of previous clinical experience with bevacizumab, the commonly expected toxicities were proteinuria
and hypertension. Before each dose of bevacizumab,
patients were tested for proteinuria using dipstick analysis.
If the dipstick indicated 2þ proteinuria, bevacizumab
was withheld and a 24-hour urine collection for protein
was obtained. Bevacizumab was continued as long as the
24-hour urine protein remained at <3500 mg/24 hours.
If proteinuria was 3500 mg/24 hours, bevacizumab was
withheld for 2 weeks, and 24-hour urine protein was
remeasured. Bevacizumab was reinitiated at the full dose
when proteinuria decreased to <3500 mg/24 hours.
Patients who developed grade 3 hypertension while
receiving bevacizumab were treated with standard antihypertensive therapies. If grade 4 hypertension developed,
bevacizumab was discontinued. Bevacizumab was withheld for patients who had grade 3 or 4 bleeding, and was

4124

discontinued if any life-threatening hemorrhagic events
occurred. With bleeding events of grade 3, bevacizumab
could be reinitiated at the discretion of the treating physician after the bleeding episode had resolved. Bevacizumab
was also discontinued for any grade 4 toxicities believed to
be related to the drug.
A single dose reduction of everolimus to 5 mg daily
was allowed. For patients with grade 3 or 4 hematologic
toxicity, everolimus therapy was interrupted until the toxicity recovered to grade 2, and then reintroduced at a
daily dose of 5 mg. For patients with grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, everolimus was interrupted until the toxicity improved to grade 1 and then was reinitiated with a
dose reduction to 5 mg daily. Patients who developed
grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity had everolimus discontinued. Nonhematologic toxicity that failed to improve
after a treatment interruption of >2 weeks resulted in the
discontinuation of everolimus.
If the discontinuation of bevacizumab or everolimus
occurred because of toxicity, patients were allowed to continue the other drug if they were believed to be receiving
clinical benefit from treatment.
Definition of Response
All patients were re-evaluated for response after the completion of 6 weeks of treatment, and response categories
were assigned using RECIST criteria.21 All patients with
major responses had confirmation of response with repeat
scans performed at 6-week intervals. Patients with stable
disease (ie, those who did not meet RECIST criteria for either partial response or disease progression) at 6 weeks
were re-evaluated at 6-week intervals as treatment continued. The final response category assigned to these patients
represented the best response obtained during the treatment course.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this phase 2 clinical trial was to
assess the activity of the combination of bevacizumab and
everolimus in the treatment of patients with metastatic
melanoma. The primary endpoint was progression-free
survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and toxicity
evaluation.
On the basis of the low levels of activity observed
with multiple other regimens in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, as well as the single-agent activity noted
with everolimus (a PFS rate of 30% at 16 weeks), a PFS
rate of at least 50% after 16 weeks was considered to be

sufficient to continue the development of this regimen. A
preliminary evaluation of activity was planned after treatment of the first 19 patients. At that time, if fewer than 7
patients remained free of disease progression at first reevaluation, the trial was to be stopped. If >7 patients
remained free of disease progression at the time of the first
re-evaluation (after 6 weeks of treatment), the trial was
scheduled to continue to a total of 55 patients. If 22
patients were free of disease progression at 12 weeks, the
study would be considered to have demonstrated a positive result for this population of patients based on a 1sided optimal 2-stage test of proportion at the 5% significance level and 80% power.
PFS was measured from the date of first study treatment to the date of disease progression or death. OS was
measured from the date of first study treatment until the
date of death. Survival curves were calculated using the
method of Kaplan and Meier.22 All patients who received
at least 1 dose of treatment were included in the toxicity
analysis. Toxicity was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between February 2008 and October 2008, 57 patients
were enrolled in this clinical trial. Patient characteristics
are detailed in Table 2. The median age of the patients

Cancer

September 1, 2010

was 70 years (range, 36-88 years); 68% of patients were
male. The large majority of patients had good performance status (ECOG performance status of 0 or 1),
although 29 patients (51%) had stage M1c disease and
26% of patients had liver metastases. Thirty-two patients
(56%) had not received previous systemic therapy.
Treatment Received
Fifty-three of the 57 patients (93%) received at least 2
cycles (6 weeks) of treatment and were evaluated for
response. Four patients discontinued treatment during
the first 6 weeks for the following reasons: toxicity (interstitial pneumonitis; 1 patient), intercurrent illness (fall
with rib fractures; 1 patient), patient request (1 patient),
and death (possibly treatment-related) because of myocardial infarction (1 patient).
The median number of treatment cycles received
was 4 (range, 1-14þ cycles). At the time of last follow-up,
4 patients were continuing treatment after treatment
durations of 9 to 13 months. A total of 53 patients had
discontinued treatment, 35 because of tumor progression;
additional reasons for discontinuing treatment included
treatment-related toxicity (5 patients), intercurrent illness
(8 patients), and patient/physician decision (5 patients).
Efficacy
Seven patients (12%) achieved major responses to treatment (a complete response in 1 patient and partial
responses in 6 patients). Five of the 7 patients with major
responses had metastases in visceral locations (M1b disease in 1 patient and M1c disease in 4 patients). An additional 33 patients were classified as having stable disease as
per RECIST criteria. Twenty-three of these patients had
objective shrinkage of measurable lesions (between 530%), but did not meet the criteria for a partial response.
Overall, 30 patients (53%) had objective improvements
in tumor measurements, as shown in Figure 1.
The estimated PFS for all patients is shown in Figure
2. After a median follow-up of 13 months, the median
PFS was 4 months (95% confidence interval, 2.8-5.3
months), with a 1-year PFS rate of 7%. The median OS
and OS rate for the entire group were 8.6 months and
43%, respectively (Fig. 3).
The objective response rates were similar in previously untreated patients compared with those who had
received 1 or 2 previous regimens (16% vs 8%, respectively). For responding patients, the median duration of
response was 7 months (range, 4-10þ months); 3 patients

months of treatment, respectively.
Toxicity
Treatment-related toxicities are listed in Table 3. The
combination of bevacizumab and everolimus was well tolerated by the majority of patients, although grade 1/2 toxicities were relatively common. The most common grade
3/4 toxicities included fatigue (12%), hypertension
(11%), and stomatitis (11%). Serious hematologic toxicity was uncommon, with only 4 patients developing grade
3 thrombocytopenia. Five patients were required to discontinue treatment because of toxicity (interstitial pneumonitis in 2 patients, proteinuria in 1 patient, epistaxis in
1 patient, and abdominal pain in 1 patient). An additional

24 patients required dose reductions of everolimus at
some time during therapy, but were able to continue treatment with a modified dose. There was 1 death reported
during this study (from myocardial infarction) that was
considered to be possibly related to treatment.

DISCUSSION
Metastatic melanoma remains 1 of the few advanced
malignancies for which systemic therapy has failed to alter
the disease course. Traditional cytotoxic agents have been
ineffective, and current efforts are focused almost exclusively on novel, targeted agents. New classes of agents currently of interest in the treatment of advanced melanoma
Cancer

include the angiogenesis inhibitors and agents affecting
the PI3K/AKT pathway, including mTOR inhibitors.
Several inhibitors of angiogenesis have demonstrated
single-agent activity against melanoma, including bevacizumab, sorafenib, PTK787, sunitinib, axitinib, and
aflibercept.7-10,14 Limited experience with mTOR
inhibitors has failed to demonstrate substantial singleagent activity17,18; however, the down-regulation of the
VEGF receptor induced by these agents provides a rationale for testing an mTOR inhibitor in combination
with an antiangiogenesis agent. Our previous experience
with the combination of bevacizumab and everolimus in
the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma had demonstrated this combination to be active
and well tolerated,20 and therefore this combination was
chosen for evaluation in patients with metastatic melanoma.
In the group of 57 patients with metastatic melanoma included in this clinical trial, the combination of
bevacizumab and everolimus demonstrated activity.
Major responses occurred in 13% of patients, whereas
53% had objective improvement in their tumor measurements noted during therapy (Fig. 1). The median PFS of
4 months met the targeted endpoint for activity in this
trial. However, the majority of the responses in this trial
were brief, and the estimated PFS rate at 1 year was only
7%. As in our previous experience, delivery of both drugs
at full doses was possible with this regimen, which was
well tolerated by most patients. Treatment-related toxicity
was consistent with the known toxicity profiles of each of
these agents when used separately.
It is worth mentioning that the clinical characteristics of the patients in the current trial differed in several
ways from those reported in other recent trials. First,
patients in our trial had a median age of 70 years, which to
our knowledge is approximately 10 years older than the
median ages reported in other trials. Second, the proportion of patients with M1c disease (51%) was lower than in
recently reported trials, in which this proportion was usually reported to be >70%.13,23-26 The reasons for these
differences in patient characteristics are unknown, but
may reflect the community-based patient population.
Finally, nearly half of the patients in the current study had
received at least 1 previous regimen for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma. The impact of these differences on
the observed activity of the combination of bevacizumab
and everolimus is also speculative.
Although the activity observed in this clinical trial
was only modest, further exploration of inhibitors of these
pathways is most likely indicated in the treatment of

Cancer

patients with malignant melanoma. Several other trials
have evaluated angiogenesis inhibitors in combination
with chemotherapy, and have reported mixed results. In a
randomized phase 2 trial, patients with metastatic melanoma received first-line treatment with the combination
of paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or without bevacizumab.27 Although this trial did not meet its survival endpoint, there was a trend toward improved PFS (5.6
months vs 4.2 months) and OS (12.3 months vs 9.2
months) in the group treated with bevacizumab. However, a similar trial adding sorafenib instead of bevacizumab to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin
indicated no benefit in the sorafenib group.23 Given the
demonstrated modest activity of the angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of advanced melanoma, it is possible
that the activity observed in this trial was produced by
bevacizumab alone.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can be activated
by several mechanisms including: 1) activation of PI3K
via signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases or Ras; 2)
overexpression of AKT; or 3) loss or inactivation of the
suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN).28-30 Activation of AKT leads to multiple downstream effects, including aberrant signaling through
mTOR and phosphorylation of multiple other substrates
contributing to a malignant phenotype (including murine
double minute protein [MDM2], nuclear factor jb, bcl
2-associated death promoter, glycogen synthase kinase 3b
[GSK3b], human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and
p27).28 To our knowledge, the best way to inhibit this
pathway is not currently clear, and it is possible that inhibitors of PI3K or AKT will prove more effective than
mTOR inhibitors.
Interactions between the PI3K/AKT pathway and
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
may provide another treatment strategy. The MAPK
pathway is activated in 60% to 80% of melanomas,
because of activating mutations in either BRAF or
NRAS.31 Inhibition of the MAPK pathway with either
BRAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors has recently shown great promise in the treatment of
patients with metastatic melanoma.32,33 However, activation of the MAPK pathway frequently results in the concurrent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.34 In
addition, inhibition of the mTOR pathway can induce
activation of the MAPK pathway via a PI3K-dependent
feedback loop.35 The interconnection of these pathways
suggests that the combined inhibition of the PI3K/AKT
and MAPK pathways may greatly increase treatment

efficacy in patients with melanoma, and several such combinations currently are being actively investigated.
After years of frustration, it appears finally that treatment advances are on the horizon for patients with metastatic melanoma. The availability of new agents with
novel targets, coupled with the increased understanding
of the unique biology of this cancer, provide realistic hope
for significant advances in the near future.
