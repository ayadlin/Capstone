ABSTRACT
The antitumorigenic mechanism of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor
celecoxib is still a matter of debate. Using lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460) and
metastatic cells derived from a lung cancer patient, the present study investigates the
impact of celecoxib on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)
and cancer cell lysis by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Celecoxib, but not other
structurally related selective COX-2 inhibitors (i.e., etoricoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib), was
found to cause a substantial upregulation of ICAM-1 protein levels. Likewise, ICAM-1
mRNA expression was increased by celecoxib. Celecoxib enhanced the susceptibility
of cancer cells to be lysed by LAK cells with the respective effect being reversed by a
neutralizing ICAM-1 antibody. In addition, enhanced killing of celecoxib-treated cancer
cells was reversed by preincubation of LAK cells with an antibody to lymphocyte function
associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), suggesting intercellular ICAM-1/LFA-1 crosslink as crucial
event within this process. Finally, celecoxib elicited no significant increase of LAK cellmediated lysis of non-tumor bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, associated with a far
less ICAM-1 induction as compared to cancer cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate
celecoxib-induced upregulation of ICAM-1 on lung cancer cells to be responsible for
intercellular ICAM-1/LFA-1 crosslink that confers increased cancer cell lysis by LAK
cells. These findings provide proof for a novel antitumorigenic mechanism of celecoxib.

and Drug Administration in 1999. In matter of lung
cancer reports have suggested celecoxib as treatment and
preventive option [3–6] and to enhance the response to
preoperative paclitaxel and carboplatin in early-stage
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [7]. Taken into
account that lung cancer is worldwide the most common
cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality and that
the response and remission rates in NSCLC patients still
remain relatively low [8], these findings may offer new
pharmacotherapeutical options in this field.
On the cellular level celecoxib exerts its
anticarcinogenic action primarily via induction of cancer
cell apoptosis or inhibition of proliferation (for review

INTRODUCTION
Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of the prostaglandin
(PG)-synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
[1]. Owing to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects,
the selective COX-2 inhibitor (coxib) was approved
for the symptomatic treatment of pain associated with
rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis in 1998. In addition, a
6-months treatment with a daily dose of 800 mg celecoxib
was demonstrated to result in significant reductions of
colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP) [2], resulting in celecoxib’s approval
for adjuvant treatment of FAP patients by the US Food

see [9]). Increasing evidence suggests a significant part
of this action to occur independent of celecoxib’s COX-2
inhibitory activity [9–13]. In a recent study, celecoxib
was shown to even enhance COX-2 expression and PG
formation by lung cancer cells as key events within its
proapoptotic action [14]. However, the impact of celecoxib
on cancer cell lysis resulting from tumor-immune
interactions has been poorly investigated. In one study,
celecoxib was found to produce a downregulation of major
histocompatibility complex I molecule expression on
metastatic breast cancer cells, thereby leading to improved
recognition by natural killer (NK) cells conferring an
enhanced tumor cell lysis [15].
The
intercellular
adhesion
molecule
1
(ICAM-1), a glycoprotein consisting of five extracellular
immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane and a
C-terminal intracellular domain [16], plays an important role
in tumor immune surveillance and elimination of neoplastic
cells [17]. There are several studies indicating cytokineinduced upregulation of ICAM-1 on cancer cells [18–23]
or cancer cell transfection with the ICAM-1 gene [24, 25]
to confer increased cytotoxic tumor cell lysis by immune
cells. In the same context, a recent in vitro study suggests
ICAM-1 upregulation as part of pharmacotherapeutic
strategies. Accordingly, cannabinoids, a group of substances
with diverse anticarcinogenic properties, have been shown
to enhance the susceptibility of lung cancer cells to cytolytic
death mediated by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)
cells via increase of ICAM-1 on cancer cell surface [26].
In line with its antitumorigenic responses observed in vitro,
ICAM-1 expression has been likewise reported to be
negatively correlated with metastasis of several cancer types
in clinical studies [27–29].
The present study investigates the impact of
celecoxib on tumor immune surveillance and the role of
ICAM-1 within this process. Here we show that celecoxib,
but not other structurally related COX-2 inhibitors,
induces an upregulation of ICAM-1 expression on lung
cancer cells, thereby causing increased cancer cell lysis by
LAK cells. These findings provide evidence for a hitherto
unknown mechanism underlying the anticarcinogenic
action of celecoxib.

Additional experiments were performed to investigate
the impact of three other structurally similar selective COX-2
inhibitors (etoricoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib) on ICAM-1
protein expression (Fig. 1D–1F). In fact, an upregulation of
ICAM-1 protein greater than 3-fold was unique for celecoxib
and was not shared by other selective COX-2 inhibitors.
These findings are consistent with recently published data by
our group indicating an upregulation of COX-2 expression
by celecoxib, but not by other COX-2 inhibitors [14].
Time-course experiments revealed a significant
upregulation of ICAM-1 protein expression in lung
cancer cells after a 48-h incubation with 30 μM celecoxib
(Fig. 2A–2C). In accordance to elevated protein levels an
increase of ICAM-1 mRNA level was detected after 6 h in
each cell line (Fig. 2D–2F).

Celecoxib increases LAK cell-mediated
tumor cell lysis
To investigate the functional consequence of
increased ICAM-1 expression by celecoxib, LAK cellmediated tumor cell killing was investigated using a
co-culture of LAK cells and pretreated cancer cells at
a defined effector:target cell ratio (see Materials and
Methods). Noteworthy, lymphocyte function associated
antigen 1 (LFA-1), the cognate ICAM-1 receptor
on the surface of immune cells, has recently been
demonstrated to confer LAK cell-mediated killing of lung
cancer cells incubated with the ICAM-1-upregulating
phytocannabinoid cannabidiol before [26].
The close interactions between tumor cells and LAK
cells were visualized by scanning electron microscopy
showing a firm attachment of the LAK cell with their
processes to the tumor cell surface (Fig. 3A, upper
two panels). The identity of LAK cells was verified by
immuno-labelling using an LFA-1 antibody in conjunction
with a secondary antibody coupled to 15 nm colloidal
gold, detectable as bright dots by high resolution electron
microscopy (Fig. 3A, lower two panels with inserts).
The scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that
gold grains indicating LFA-1 expression decorate the
cell surface and processes of LAK cells (e.g., lowermost
panel, open arrows), whereas the cell bodies and filopodial
extensions of the underlying tumor cells are devoid of
LFA-1 labelling (lowermost panel, filled arrows).
To address the impact of celecoxib on LAK cellmediated tumor cell lysis, tumor cells that were incubated
with increasing concentrations of celecoxib for 48 h were
subsequently labeled with calcein-AM and co-cultured
with LAK cells. Following a 6-h incubation, tumor cell
lysis was measured by detection of calcein fluorescence
in the supernatant. As shown in Fig. 3B–3D, celecoxib at
30 μM increased LAK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis of
each tested lung cancer cell line. In some cases lysis of
cancer cells appeared to be higher in the absence of LAK
cells resulting in negative values of calculated percental

RESULTS
Celecoxib induces ICAM-1 expression on both
protein and mRNA level
To investigate the impact of celecoxib on ICAM-1
expression and tumor cell lysis two human NSCLC cell
lines (A549, H460) as well as metastatic cells derived
from a lung cancer patient were used. In each of these
cell types celecoxib was found to stimulate the protein
expression of ICAM-1 (Fig. 1A–1C). According to an
all-or-none principle this effect was significant after a
treatment with 30 μM celecoxib in all three cell lines.

from other groups [23, 30].
Recently, our group reported a toxic effect of
celecoxib on lung tumor cells [14]. Thus, viability tests
were performed. As compared to vehicle (100% viability),
incubation of tumor cells with 30 μM celecoxib yielded
viability rates of 64% ± 8% for A549, 49% ± 3% for H460

LFA-1 antibody reverses celecoxib-induced
tumor cell killing by LAK cells

2 h before killing assay was started. According to the
histograms presented in Fig. 6C–6E, the neutralizing
LFA-1 antibody significantly inhibited the effect of
LAK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis by celecoxib. These
results indicate LFA-1 as a potential receptor for ICAM-1
conferring LAK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis.

The interaction of tumor and LAK cells is
shown by light microscopy in Fig. 6A. According to
immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 6B), CD11a (LFA-1)
is present on the surface of LAK cells (Fig. 6B, green
fluorescence), but not detectable on the surface of tumor
cells.

lysis of celecoxib-treated tumor cells, LAK cells were

celecoxib did not cause a significant upregulation
of ICAM-1 protein expression in BEAS-2B cells.
In comparison, the same concentration of celecoxib
tested under comparable experimental conditions
resulted in an upregulation of ICAM-1 protein level in
lung cancer cells (A549, H460, lung cancer patient’s
metastatic cells) by up to 3.7- (Fig. 1A), 8- (Fig. 1B) or
6.3-fold (Fig. 1C) over control. Additional experiments

DISCUSSION
The present study provides first-time proof for
celecoxib to induce upregulation of the adhesion molecule
ICAM-1 on the surface of tumor cells, resulting in
increased tumor cell lysis by LAK cells.

There are several lines of evidence supporting this
notion. First, celecoxib caused a substantial upregulation of
ICAM-1 expression on both mRNA and protein level in lung
tumor cell lines as well as in metastatic lung cancer cells.
Second, celecoxib treatment of lung cancer cells resulted in
an enhanced susceptibility to cytotoxic lysis by LAK cells.
Third, the celecoxib-induced increase of LAK cell-mediated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lysis of tumor cells was abrogated by neutralizing antibodies
against ICAM-1 and LFA-1. The LFA-1 heterodimer
(CD11a/CD18) is the natural ligand of ICAM-1 [31] that
has been reported to represent an important link to conjugate
ICAM-1-bearing cells with natural killer cells [32] and to
confer lymphocyte-induced tumor cell killing [33]. The data
presented here suggest LFA-1 as a crucial counter-receptor

of ICAM-1 in conferring the celecoxib-induced enhanced
susceptibility of lung cancer cells to LAK cell-mediated
killing. Fourth, tumor cells were lysed by celecoxib-treated
LAK cells to a comparable extent as by untreated or vehicletreated LAK cells, thereby confirming celecoxib to enhance
the susceptibility of tumor cells to LAK cell-induced killing
while sparing direct effects on LAK cell activity. Overall,
this data are in good line with several studies indicating
enhanced ICAM-1 expression to confer an increased
lysis of cancer cells by immune cells comprising NK and
LAK cells, monocytes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
[18–26].
In the present study upregulation of ICAM-1 protein
expression in lung cancer cells was confined to celecoxib
and was not elicited by other related selective COX-2
inhibitors (i. e., etoricoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib) bearing
a diaryl heterocyclic structure. This pattern is in agreement
with a recent study from our group that shows a specificity
of celecoxib among other selective COX-2 inhibitors in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inducing lung cancer cell apoptosis and upregulating
COX-2 expression [14]. Likewise, celecoxib, but not
other selective COX-2 inhibitors, has been reported
to induce apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts [34] and to
cause antiproliferative effects on colon cancer cells and
reduction of tumor growth in vivo [35].
Clearly, the concentrations of celecoxib causing
ICAM-1 expression (i.e., 30 μM) or apoptosis in
other studies (i.e., 40–100 μM) [9] exceed plasma
concentrations of celecoxib, which have been reported
to reach a maximum of 7.67 μM after single-dose
administration of 800 mg celecoxib to human volunteers
[1]. However, the unique effects of celecoxib within the
coxibs may be due to an intracellular accumulation of this
COX-2 inhibitor. Accordingly, celecoxib was detected
at five- to ten-fold higher intracellular concentrations
in different tumor cell types when compared to other
coxibs (etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib)
[36]. According to Maier et al. [36] the intracellular
39350

Oncotarget

accumulation of celecoxib results from integration into
cellular phospholipid membranes and may thus provide
a molecular basis for celecoxib’s ability to interact with
non-COX-2 targets in vivo despite comparatively low
plasma concentrations [36]. For example, celecoxib at
50 μM has been reported to cause a COX-2-independent
activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB
[37, 38] that plays a pivotal role in ICAM-1 expression
[39]. In addition, higher intracellular concentrations
may be achieved in vivo through longer exposure times.
Accordingly, cancer patients receive repeated treatment
over weeks or months resulting in cumulative effects of
the respective chemotherapy or radiation therapy [9, 40].
Upregulation of ICAM-1 is likewise supposed to
mediate several adverse effects such as perpetuation of
bronchial injury by adhesion of neutrophils to epithelial
cells [41]. Consequently, the impact of celecoxib on
healthy tissue was evaluated by use of the bronchial
epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, which was established from
normal bronchial epithelium of non-cancerous individuals
[42]. However, in contrast to lung cancer cells celecoxib
neither significantly affected ICAM-1 protein expression
nor susceptibility of these cells against LAK cell-induced
cytotoxicity. In line with this finding celecoxib was
previously reported to impair the growth of colorectal
cancer in vivo without causing toxic effects on normal gut
epithelium [43].
In matter of ICAM-1 expression some studies
indicate an inhibition of protein expression by celecoxib.
Thus, celecoxib was shown to cause inhibition of ICAM-1
expression in colon cancer cells and a decreased adhesion
to fetal calf serum (FCS)-coated plastic wells with both
events mediated via a COX-2-independent pathway [44].
However, the maximal inhibitory effect of celecoxib
(10 μM) on ICAM-1 expression occurred after a 4-h
incubation with a maximal decrease of about 45% and
already declined after 6 h [44]. In another investigation
the same group found a 4-h incubation of tumor necrosis
factor α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial
cells with celecoxib to decrease ICAM-1 and vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 expression with a maximal inhibition
of about 60% and 50% at 10 μM celecoxib, respectively,
followed by reduced adhesion of colon cancer cells
to endothelial cells [45]. Further studies indicate that
celecoxib treatment of mice with experimentally induced
atherosclerosis [46] and autoimmune encephalomyelitis
[47] or rats with colitis and lung injury [48, 49] decreases
the expression of ICAM-1. The reasons for this apparent
discrepancy remain to be identified but may be explained,
in case of in vitro studies, by the different experimental
settings and specificity of cell types, respectively.
Altogether, the results of this study argue for
an antitumorigenic function of ICAM-1. This view is
further corroborated by animal studies that determined
a 2.6-fold greater tumor volume in ICAM-1-deficient
mice than in wild-type mice 14 days after injection of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

melanoma cells [50] or a development of malignant
tumors in LFA-1-deficient but not wild-type mice
injected with cancer cells [51]. In athymic nude mice
the non-psychoactive cannabidiol elicited an increase of
ICAM-1 protein in A549 xenografts and an antimetastatic
effect that was fully reversed by a neutralizing antibody
against ICAM-1 [52]. In other murine models ICAM-1
overexpression on tumor cells was found to elicit a reduced
tumor growth [25, 53]. Analyses of primary tumors from
patients with breast cancer revealed a negative correlation
of ICAM-1 expression to tumor size, lymph node
metastasis and tumor infiltration as well as a better relapsefree and overall survival in patients with ICAM-1-positive
tumors than in those with negative tumors [27]. In line with
this notion, the incidence of lymph node or liver metastasis
was significantly lower in patients with ICAM-1-positive
colorectal tumors than in those with ICAM-1-negative
tumors [29]. Infiltration of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
was more frequently observed in the ICAM-1-positive
tumors in this study [29]. In patients with gastric cancer
ICAM-1 expression on cancer cells was significantly
decreased in patients with lymph node metastasis with
the prognosis of patients being poorer in patients with
ICAM-1-negative tumors [28]. Other studies showed an
association between ICAM-1 expression and infiltration of
lymphocytes into tumor tissue of patients with renal cell
carcinoma [54], colorectal [55] and esophageal cancer [56].
Collectively, the present study identified
upregulation of ICAM-1 expression in lung cancer cells
leading to LAK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis as a novel
antitumorigenic mechanism of celecoxib. Further studies
addressing the impact of celecoxib on tumor immune
surveillance in vivo are suggested to better understand the
pharmacological action of this drug.

antibody (Nr. EMGMHL 15) and fish gelatin (Nr. GEL 10)
were provided by BBI Solutions (Cardiff, UK).

CD11a and LEAF™ Purified Mouse IgG1, κ Isotype
Control antibody were supplied soluted in 0.2 μm filtered
PBS (pH 7.2), containing no preservative and an endotoxin
level < 0.01 ng/μg of the protein. For further dilutions PBS
was used. For all antibody approaches PBS was used as
vehicle control.

Generation of LAK cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors. A volume of
50–70 ml of each buffy coat was diluted 1:2 with PBS,
carefully poured over 20 ml of Lymphocyte Separation
Medium (LSM 1077) and centrifuged at 1171 × g for
25 min; no brake was applied during deceleration.
Following centrifugation lymphocytes concentrating in
the interphase (white phase) were collected and washed
twice with PBS. Washing was performed by centrifugation
at 300 × g for 10 min in the first step and 200 × g for
10 min in the second step. After centrifugation pellets
were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin. Adherent cells were removed from PBMC
suspensions (2 × 106 cells/ml) by attachment to plastic at
the flask bottom for 1–2 h. This procedure was repeated
once more before cells in the culture supernatant were
subjected to further treatment. For generation of LAK
cells the cell suspension was incubated with 10 ng/ml IL-2
for 6 days at a density of about 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. After
3 days the medium was changed and fresh IL-2 was added.
For some experiments fractions of LAK cells were
treated with vehicle or celecoxib. In this case vehicle or
celecoxib was added to LAK cell suspension into the
culture flask 48 h before starting the LAK cell cytotoxicity
assay.

Cell culture
The NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460, the
lung cancer patient’s metastatic cells as well as the
human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (ATCCLGC, Wesel, Germany) were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A549
human lung carcinoma cells were purchased from
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany; A549: DSMZ no.:
ACC 107, species confirmation as human with IEF of
MDH, NP; fingerprint: multiplex PCR of minisatellite
markers revealed a unique DNA profile). H460 cells
were purchased from ATCC-LGC (Wesel, Germany;
ATCC™ Number: HTB-177™; cell line confirmation by
cytogenetic analysis). Following resuscitation of frozen
cultures none of the cell lines was cultured longer than
6 months.
Lung cancer patient’s metastatic cells were obtained
from resection of brain metastasis of a 47-year-old female
Caucasian with NSCLC with the procedure of cell
preparation described recently [52]. The patient had been
informed about the establishment of cellular models from
its tumor and had given informed consent in written form.
The procedure was approved by the institutional ethical
committee. Experiments were performed using passages
2–15 of these cells.
Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at
37°C and 5% CO2. All incubations with test substances
were performed in serum-free medium. PBS was used as
vehicle for COX-2 inhibitors with a final concentration
of 0.1% (v/v) DMSO. As vehicle control PBS containing
0.1% (v/v) DMSO was used. The neutralizing ICAM-1/
CD54 antibody and the isotype control antibody were
dissolved in PBS. The LEAF™ Purified anti-human

LAK cell cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of LAK cells on tumor or BEAS-2B
cells was determined by the calcein-AM release assay.
Tumor or BEAS-2B cells (target cells) were seeded into
96-well flat bottom plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well
and were allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were washed with
PBS and treated with vehicle or test substance in serumfree DMEM. Following a 48-h incubation period, target
cells were washed and labeled with 5 μM calcein-AM for
30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and
generated LAK cells (effector cells) were added to target
cells at an effector:target cell ratio of 4:1 in a final volume
of 100 μl/well. After a 6-h incubation (37°C, 5% CO2)
supernatants were transferred to other wells of the 96-well
plate and remaining target cells were lysed with 2% (v/v)
Triton® X-100. The fluorescence of supernatants and lysed
target cells was recorded using a 485 nm excitation filter
and a 535 nm emission filter by a Tecan infinite pro200 plate
reader. LAK cell-induced cytotoxicity was monitored by the
release of calcein by cancer cells into the supernatant due

to toxic effects induced by LAK cells in the co-culture. To
account for a probable modulation of cancer cell viability by
vehicle or test substances, the fluorescence of cancer cells
in the absence of effector cells, referred to as spontaneous
release of calcein, was subtracted from these values. Finally,
values were normalised to the release of calcein that can be
achieved maximally by the effector cells. The percentage
of LAK cytotoxicity was calculated as follows: % LAK
cytotoxicity  = (fluorescence of supernatant of sample
well with effector cells - fluorescence of spontaneous
release) / (fluorescence of maximal release - fluorescence
of spontaneous release) [18]. Blank values were subtracted
from the experimental data. Before LAK cytotoxicity was
calculated the raw data of the fluorescent measurement were
analysed with Nalimov test and outliers were excluded.
In parallel to the LAK cell cytotoxicity assay viability of
tumor cells was determined under equal conditions using
the WST-1 assay (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany).
Experiments to determine the functional
involvement of ICAM-1 in enhanced LAK cell-mediated
tumor cell killing were performed using a neutralizing
antibody against ICAM-1. Experiments with the ICAM-1
neutralizing antibody were performed by incubation
of target cells with 1 μg/ml of an ICAM-1 antibody or
an isotype control antibody as negative control for
2 h. Following preincubation of cancer cells with the
antibodies, supernatants were removed carefully and
without washing the co-incubation with LAK cells was
started. For analysis of the involvement of LFA-1 in LAK
cell-mediated tumor cell lysis a CD11a antibody or an
isotype control antibody was used. Experiments were
carried out by incubation of LAK cells with 1 μg/ml of
the respective antibody for 2 h before starting cytotoxicity
assay by adding the LAK cell suspension with the therein
containing antibody to the target cells.

density of 2 × 105 cells/well for 24 h and subsequently
incubated with vehicle or test substance for 48 h. After
incubation cells were washed with PBS, harvested and
lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton® X-100, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml
leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysis was performed
for at least 30 min on ice and frequently mixing on a
vortex mixer. Subsequently, lysates were centrifuged at
10,000 × g for 5 min and supernatants were then used for
Western blot analysis. Total protein of cell lysates was
determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce,
Rockford, USA). Proteins were separated using 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany) that were blocked with 5% milk
powder (BioRad, Munich, Germany). Membranes were
incubated with a primary mouse monoclonal antibody
raised to ICAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany) at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, blots were
probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt
am Main, Germany) and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Antibody binding was visualized by a
chemiluminiferous solution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5,
1.25 mM luminol, 200 mM p-coumaric acid, 0.09% [v/v]
H2O2, 0.0072% [v/v] DMSO). Densitometric analysis
of band intensities was achieved by optical scanning
and quantifying using the Quantity One 1-D Analysis
Software (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). To identify the
band size of the Western blots, the prestained SDS-PAGE
Standard (Broad Range; Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) was
used. A regression of the prestained standard revealed a
band size of ICAM-1 at 90 kDa and of β-actin at 42 kDa.
Vehicle controls were defined as 100% for evaluation of
changes in protein expression. To ascertain equal protein
loading in Western blots of cell lysates, membranes
were probed with an antibody raised to β-actin (SigmaAldrich). All densitometric values were normalized to
β-actin.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Lung cancer cells were seeded into 24-well plates
at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow for
24 h. Following incubation of cells with celecoxib or its
vehicle for the indicated times, cell culture media were
removed and cells were lysed for subsequent RNA isolation.
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy total RNA Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). β-Actin- (internal standard)
and ICAM-1 mRNA levels were determined by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan® RNA-to-CT™ Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. Primers and probe for
human β-actin and ICAM-1 were Gene Expression Assay™
products (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).

Analysis of CD11a with fluorescence microscopy
For imaging of CD11a A549 cells were seeded at a
density of 1–1.5 × 105 cells/ml in 4-well culture slides (BD
Falcon™, Heidelberg, Germany). After 3 days tumor cells
were incubated with LAK cells at an effector:target cell
ratio of 4:1 for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS and
blocked with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton® X-100
and 5% (v/v) FCS for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells
were incubated with a CD11a antibody (1:250) for 1 h.
For this purpose the same antibody as in the LAK cell
cytotoxicity assay was used. As secondary antibody a
goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled IgG (1:1000)
was used and incubation took place for 1 h as well. All

interest.

The NSCLC cell line A549 was seeded on
Melinex® films (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany) at a density
of 5 × 105  cells per well in a 24-well plate. After tumor
cells were co-cultured with LAK cells (effector:target
cell ratio of 4:1) for 3 h, cells were carefully washed with
PBS containing magnesium and calcium (each at 1 mM).
Afterwards, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
containing magnesium and calcium (each at 1 mM)
overnight. Subsequently, cells were blocked with 5% (v/v)
NGS in PBS for 30 min and incubated with the primary
CD11a (LFA-1) antibody (1:250) diluted in PBS containing
5% (v/v) NGS. For this purpose the same antibody as in
the LAK cell cytotoxicity assay was used. After 1 h of
incubation cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1%
(v/v) Tween® 20 before secondary goat anti-mouse antibody
15 nm gold (1:50) diluted in PBS containing 5% (v/v) NGS,
0.1% (v/v) Tween® 20 and 0.1% (v/v) fish skin gelatin was
added for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS containing 5%
(v/v) NGS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween® 20 and 0.1% (v/v) fish skin
gelatin and post-fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde.
For scanning electron microscopy, the film supports
with the attached cells were washed with 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer pH 7.3 and were subsequently dehydrated
in a graded series of acetone. Critical point drying was
performed in an Emitech K850 critical point dryer (Emitech
Ltd. Ashford, UK) after three rounds of immersion in
CO2. The dried film supports were mounted on scanning
electron microscopy stubs with adhesive carbon tape
(Plano, Wetzlar, Germany) and coated with a carbon layer
using a Leica SCD500 coater (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). Specimens were viewed in a Merlin VP compact
scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Jena, Germany) operated at 5 kV. Images with a size of
1024 × 768 and 2048 × 1536 pixels were recorded with
the SmartSEM Software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and were
processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Inc. San Jose,
CA, USA).
