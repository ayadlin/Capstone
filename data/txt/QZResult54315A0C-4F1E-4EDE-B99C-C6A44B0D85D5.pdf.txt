ABSTRACT
BAG3, member the HSP70 co-chaperones family, has been shown to play a
relevant role in the survival, growth and invasiveness of different tumor types. In
this study, we investigate the expression of BAG3 in 66 specimens from different lung
tumors and the role of this protein in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor growth.
Normal lung tissue did not express BAG3 while we detected the expression of BAG3 by
immunohistochemistry in all the 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas
and 4 large cell carcinomas. Furthermore, we detected BAG3 expression in 22 of
the 36 SCLCs analyzed. The role on SCLC cell survival was determined by downregulating BAG3 levels in two human SCLC cell lines, i.e. H69 and H446, in vitro and
measuring cisplatin induced apoptosis. Indeed down-regulation of BAG3 determines
increased cell death and sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment. The effect of BAG3
down-regulation on tumor growth was also investigated in an in vivo xenograft model
by treating mice with an adenovirus expressing a specific bag3 siRNA. Treatment with
bag3 siRNA-Ad significantly reduced tumor growth and improved animal survival. In
conclusion we show that a subset of SCLCs over express BAG3 that exerts an antiapoptotic effect resulting in resistance to chemotherapy.

of 15-20 months and 5-year survival below 15% [1].
Treatment of SCLC is challenging, with a short diseasefree survival after 1st line therapy [1, 2]. It is therefore
of uttermost importance to gain a deeper understanding
of the molecular events involved in SCLC tumorigenesis
and progression in order to identify novel potential targets
for therapy.
Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) belongs
to a family of co-chaperones known to interact with the
ATPase domain of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)
through the structural domain known as BAG domain
(110-124 amino acids). In addition, BAG3 contains a WW
domain, a proline-rich region (PXXP), and two conserved
IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs, that can also mediate binding to
other proteins. While BAG3 can be induced in response
to stress in cells of various origin it is constitutively
expressed only in a few, including skeletal muscle and
the heart. Importantly it is has also been shown to be
constitutive in several primary tumors and tumor cell lines
(pancreatic cancer, melanoma, leukemias, and others) [3,
4] and has been shown to play an important role in tumor
biology [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It has been suggested that its
role in tumors is due to its anti-apoptotic properties in
fact BAG3 has been shown to protect cells from death
through a number of mechanisms that in general involve
interaction with apoptosis- regulating proteins, including
the IKK gamma subunit of the NF-κB- activating complex
IKK [5], Bax [9], BRAF [10] and others [3].

Here we investigated BAG3 expression in SCLCs
and its role in tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model.
Our data suggest that indeed BAG3 is a potential target in
a subset of tumors that express it.

RESULTS
Immunohistochemical analysis of BAG3
expression in human lung neoplastic samples
We analyzed BAG3 expression in 69 samples (36
small cell lung cancers, 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 13
adenocarcinomas, 4 large cell carcinomas and 3 normal
lung samples as control) by immunoistochemistry (IHC),
using an anti-BAG3 polyclonal antibody (TOS-2). As
expected no BAG3 expression was detected in normal
lung while all the NSCLC and 22 out of the 36 SCLC

Positive tumor samples showed a cytoplasmic staining in
the majority of the cells.

Down-regulation of BAG3 reduces in vivo tumor
growth and induces apoptosis

Effect of BAG3 down-modulation on SCLC cell
apoptosis

Since in vitro data showed that down-regulation of
BAG3 induces apoptosis in SCLS cells, we investigated
the effects of bag3 siRNA-Ad treatment on tumor growth
and apoptosis in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4A, we observed
that intra-tumoral injection of bag3 siRNA-Ad was able
to reduce in vivo tumor growth after 44 days of treatment
as compared to the scramble-treated (scr siRNA-Ad) and
control groups (p<0.001). Accordingly, mice treated with
bag3 siRNA-Ad survived longer than control (PBS) and
scr siRNA-Ad-treated mice (p<0.05) (Fig. 4B). Western
blot and immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples
from xenografts treated for 12 days with bag3 siRNA-Ad
specifically confirm a reduction of BAG3 protein levels
(Fig. 5 A, B).

We then investigated the possibility that in BAG3
positive SCLCs this protein played a pro-survival role
as reported for other tumor types [3, 4]. To this end we
first evaluated BAG3 expression by western blot in five
human SCLC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, H69 and
H446 cell lines displayed the highest BAG3 protein levels
and were chosen for the subsequent experiments to test
if BAG3 silencing sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment.
Both cell lines were transfected with a bag3- specific small
interfering (si) RNA or with a non targeted (NT) siRNA.
As shown in figures 2B and C transfection with 200 nM of
bag3 specific siRNA resulted in silencing of BAG3 in both
cell lines. As shown in figure 3B and D silencing of BAG3
results in increased response to cisplatin with an increase
in both cell lines of almost 40% of apoptosis after 48 hours
of treatment with a 100 µM cisplatin. Furthermore, BAG3
silencing in H446 results also a significant increase of
basal apoptosis (Fig. 3D).
These results indicate that down-regulation of
BAG3 stimulates apoptosis in SCLC cells in vitro.

Evaluation of apoptosis using the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) FragEL™ DNA
fragmentation detection kit, an analogue of the TUNEL
method, shows that intra-tumoral injection of bag3
siRNA-Ad induced massive apoptotic cell death in tumor
cells (Figure 6C).

The pro-survival role of BAG3 in tumors largely
relies on its ability to interact with different partners,
some of which are selectively involved in the growth
of specific tumor types [4]. The molecular mechanisms
and the proteins involved in BAG3 pro-survival function
in SCLCs are still unknown and require further studies.
Recent reports indicate a relevant role for the MET
signaling pathway in SCLC biology [12, 13, 14, 15].
Indeed, MET receptor phosphorylation induced by HGF
is associated to the hyperexpression of mesenchymal
markers and chemoresistance that result in a poor
prognosis in SCLC patients [14, 15]. Furthermore, MET
receptor signaling leads to the activation of PI3K–Akt
signaling, Ras–MAP kinase cascade, STAT3 and NFκB activation, promoting cell survival, proliferation and
invasiveness [16]. Some of these signaling proteins,
including NF-κB factors [5], RAF family proteins [10]
and the downstream kinase ERK [17], have been shown
to interact with BAG3, that can modulate their levels or
activity and are therefore potentially involved in BAG3
mechanism of action in these cells.
Recently, it was demonstrated that BAG3
knockdown induces Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition

DISCUSSION
Molecular classification of lung cancer has allowed
targeted chemotherapeutic strategies. The understanding
of the role of gene mutations (EGFR, K-RAS and MET),
gene fusions (ALK) and rearrangements (ROS-1), has
improved the management of non-small-cell lung cancer
patients [11]. We suggest that evaluation of BAG3
expression might be a potentially useful classification tool
for SCLCs.
BAG3 is an anti-apoptotic protein that has been
shown to sustain cell survival in a variety of tumor types
[5, 6, 9, 10], and indeed its down-regulation appears to
induce cell apoptosis and impair tumor growth also in
SCLC cells suggesting that it may represent a novel target
for therapy in positive tumours.

(EMT) in thyroid cancer cells increasing their metastatic
potential [18]. However Xiao H. et al. have opposite
results and show that BAG3 overexpression is associated
with the increased angiogenesis and invasive ability
of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [19]. These different
results can possibly be explained by the fact that BAG3
can exert different effects depending on the cellular
context and therefore on the different proteins it interacts
and regulates [4]. Our next aim will be focused on a more
deeper understanding of the role of BAG3 in EMT cellular
context in orthotopic animal model of SCLC. It is therefore
important to study the effects of altered expression of
BAG3 in the different contexts to fully understand its
biological role. Moreover it is possible that the effect of

BAG3 on growth and survival of the primary tumor cell
and on EMT and invasive capacity are independent and
rely on different signaling pathway so it is possible that
while increased BAG3 favors tumor cell survival and
growth it prevents EMT and metastatic spreading. While
clearly both effects of BAG3 have to be taken in account
when proposing a new therapeutic approach, this goes
beyond the scope of this manuscript in which we focused
on the role of BAG3 on growth and survival of the primary
tumor.
In conclusion, our studies show that increased
expression of BAG3 in SCLCs represents an advantage
for these cells resulting in reduced cell death and increased
resistance to therapy and that evaluating BAG3 expression
may represent a potential marker of prognosis and of
response to cisplatin therapy. Finally, BAG3 could be a
novel target for therapy for the subset of SCLCs that overexpress it.

overnight at 4°C in a wet chamber with the anti-BAG3
polyclonal antibody TOS-2 (diluition 1:200 in PBS)
and anti-BAG3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) AC-1
(diluition 1:100 in PBS) (Biouniversa Srl, Fisciano, Italy),
respectively. Immunoreactivity was visualized using a
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, with diaminobenzidine as
peroxidase substrate (Dako REALTM Detection System,
Peroxidase/DAB+, Rabbit/Mouse). The stained sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls
were performed by omitting the primary antibodies (data
not shown).

Animals
Twentyfour six/eight-week-old female athymic
nude-Foxn1nu/nu mice were purchased by Harlan
Laboratories S.rl. (S. Pietro al Natisone, Italy). Mice were
housed eight per cage and maintained on a 12 hrs light:12
hrs dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m.) in a temperaturecontrolled room (22 ± 2°C) with food and water ad
libitum. The experimental protocols were in compliance
with the European Communities Council directive
(86/609/EEC). H69 xenografts were produced on the right
flank of the mice by subcutaneous injection of 3x106 H69
cells in 150 μl of Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Three
weeks after tumor cell injection, mice with tumors of
similar size (about 100 mm3) were randomized into three
groups (8 mice per group) and treated with control PBS
(100 μl), bag3 siRNA-Ad or scr siRNA-Ad (108 pfu/100
microl), by peri-tumoral injection, twice a week. Tumor
size was measured every three days by digital caliper
2Biol (Besozzo, Varese, Italy) and tumor volumes were
calculated according to the formula: V = (a x b2)/2, where
a = the largest superficial diameter and b = the smallest
superficial diameter. When the tumor burden reached
750 mm3 three mice from each group were euthanized to
assess the silencing of BAG3 by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). All other mice were sacrificed when tumor size
reached 1500 mm3 in the control group. Differences
among the treatment groups were analyzed by ANOVA
using statistical software Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla,
CA). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method,
and survival curves were compared by use of the log-rank
test [20].

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer
containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
0.1% Triton (TNN buffer) supplemented with a protease
inhibitors cocktail (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyluoride, 1
mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml aprotinin), and subjected to
3 cycles of freeze-and-thawing. Lysates were centrifuged
for 20 min at 12 000 rpm and stored at -80°C. Protein
amount was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and 30 µg of total protein were run on 10%
SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to electrophoretic transfer
to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nitrocellulose blots were
blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl and 0.01% Tween,
and incubated with primary antibody in TBST containing
5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4°C. Immunoreactivity
was detected by sequential incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL
reagents. Scanning densitometry of the bands was
performed with image scanning software (SnapScan
1212; Agfa-Gevaert, Mortsel, Belgium). The area under
the curve related to each band was determined using Gimp
version 2.6 software (http://www.gimp.org). Background
was subtracted from the calculated values.

Immunohistochemistry
Patients

Apoptosis evaluation

The paraffin sections of thirty patients with NSCLC
classified according to the degree of differentiation
and thirty-six patients with SCLC were selected by the
Pathologists of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Fondazione
G. Pascale, Napoli, Italy.

Cells transfected with bag3- specific or NT siRNA
(48 hours) were incubated with or without cisplatin at
the indicated concentrations. After 48 hour, cells were
harvested and then incubated with a propidium iodide (PI)
solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1 % Triton X-100 and 50
µg/ml of PI), for 30 min at 4°C. Apoptosis was quantified
as the proportion of cells with hypodiploid DNA (sub
G0-G1 peak) using flow cytometry (FACScan Becton
Dickinson). A minimum of 5000 events were recorded
and analyzed. Cellular debris was excluded from analysis
by raising the forward threshold. All measurements were
performed using the same instrument settings. Significance
between the groups was calculated by unpaired Student’s
t test.

Xenografts
Excised tumors were immediately fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and paraffin embedded.
Immunohistochemical staining of human and
xenograft tumor sections was performed as follows.
Five- to 6-μm-thick paraffin sections from each tumor
were deparaffinised and placed in a solution containing
0.3% hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. After
blocking, the humans and xenografts slides were incubated
