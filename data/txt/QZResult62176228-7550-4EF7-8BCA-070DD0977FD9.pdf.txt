ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accompanied by severe liver dysfunction is a
serious disease, which results in altered hepatic clearance. Generally, maintenance
doses depend upon drug clearance, so individual dosage regimens should be
customized for HCC patients based on the condition of patients. Based on clearance of
CYP isoform-specific substrates at the microsomal level (CLM), microsomal protein per
gram of liver (MPPGL), liver weight, hepatic blood flow, hepatic clearance values (CLH)
for 10 CYPs in HCC patients (n=102) were extrapolated using a predictive bottomup pharmacokinetic model. Compared with controls, the CLM values for CYP2C9, 2D6,
2E1 were significantly increased in HCC patients. Additionally, CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C19
CLM values decreased while the values for CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4/5 were unchanged. The
MPPGL values in HCC tissues were significantly reduced. CLH values of HCC patients
for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, and 3A4/5 were significantly reduced, while this
for CYP2E1 were markedly increased and those for CYP2C9 and 2D6 did not change.
Moreover, disease (fibrosis and cirrhosis) and polymorphisms of the CYP genes have
influenced the CLH for some CYPs. Prediction of the effects of HCC on drug clearance
may be helpful for the design of clinical studies and the clinical management of drugs
in HCC patients.

liver size, and plasma protein binding. These changes
can result in changed clearance compared with what
is observed in subjects with normal hepatic function.
Generally, maintenance doses depend on drug clearance,
so individual dosage regimens should be customized for
HCC patients based on the condition of each patient.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) represents a large group
of enzymes that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum
and play critical roles in the metabolism of endogenous
and exogenous molecules, including most carcinogens,
procarcinogens and drugs [2]. Previous studies of CYP
have found that the clearance for CYP3A4 in tumor tissues
from HCC patients was significantly reduced compared
with adjacent non-cancerous tissues [3]. Additionally,
in vitro studies have indicated that clearance values for
CYPs were selectively altered in the presence of cirrhosis
[4, 5]. Moreover, previously published pharmacokinetic

INTRODUCTION
Significant research efforts towards the development
of personalized medicine have been conducted
especially for patients with liver diseases that usually
are accompanied by the loss of functional hepatocytes.
Because of the complex pharmacokinetics changes that
occur in liver diseases, both the US FDA and European
Medicines Agency have released general guidelines that
recommend conducting pharmacokinetic studies when
drugs are likely to be used in patients with impaired
hepatic function.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common type of liver cancer and represents a leading
cause of cancer death worldwide [1]. HCC often results
in biochemical and physiological changes, such as altered
hepatic function, hepatic blood flow (QH), functional

studies have demonstrated that clearance for CYP3A4/5
was markedly decreased in patients with either cirrhosis
[6] or severe alcoholic cirrhosis [7], while the clearance
for CYP2C19 was also significantly reduced in patients
with liver cirrhosis [8]. Therefore, assessments of changes
in clearance values for CYPs may be useful not only
for designing personalized HCC treatments, but also for
identifying dosage regimens for drugs that are used to treat
HCC patients who suffer from other diseases. However,
studies that base dosage adjustments on changes in
clearance values for CYPs in HCC patients have not been
previously reported.
To customize individual dosage regimens for
HCC patients with scarce or imprecise available data,
in vitro studies using human liver microsomes (HLMs)
from the patients combined with predictive bottom-up
pharmacokinetic models should be employed. A study by
Johnson et al. suggested that QH, functional liver size, and
plasma protein binding were altered in correlation with
the severity of liver cirrhosis [9]. Therefore, changes in
these parameters for HCC patients might result in different
changes in drugs clearance, both in vitro and in vivo,
compared with controls. Indeed, other than QH, functional
liver size, and plasma protein binding, the change in
microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL) has been
found to be a more important parameter. Unfortunately,
data regarding MPPGL values in patients with liver
cirrhosis or HCC have not been reported, which represents
a serious obstacle to determining the CLH in HCC patients.
Accordingly, an in vitro study of 102 HCC patient
samples was performed that focused on the clearance
changes for 10 CYPs–CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9,
2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Relevant physiological
and biochemical changes related to liver disease were
incorporated into predictive bottom-up pharmacokinetic
models to analyze changes in clearance at different levels.
The effects of an accompanying disease (i.e., cirrhosis
and/or fibrosis), genetic polymorphisms, and demography
on hepatic clearance were evaluated. We hope the findings
of this study could be applied to guide appropriate trial
design for population pharmacokinetic studies or the
clinical management of drugs in HCC patients in whom
no clinical data exist.

(P=7.96E-5, 2.91E-3, and 1.56E-21, respectively),
while those values for CYP1A2, 2C8, and 2C19 were
lower (P=9.61E-9, 1.19E-24, and 3.61E-4, respectively).
The CLM values for 2A6, 2B6, and CYP3A4/5 were
unchanged. Notably, the most marked increase was the
CLM value for CYP2E1, which increased by 99.5%, while
the most prominent reduction was the CLM for CYP2C8,
which declined by 77%.
There was great intra-individual variation in the
CLM values for CYPs. Notably, the ratios of maximum
to minimum were 147.7, 1000.0, 89.0, 100.0, 56.3, 17.7,
111.6, 13.1, and 14.9 for the CLM values for CYP1A2,
2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5.

Clearance at the liver tissue level
The MPPGL values [28.85 (7.60–93.60) mg/g] were
initially determined in 102 HCC patients. The MPPGL
values in HCC patients were not normally distributed and
were significantly lower (P=1.48E-5) than the values in
control patients[39.60 (9.90–127.90) mg/g] [10].
According to the contents of MPPGL, individual
clearance of liver tissue (CLLT) for CYPs was calculated by
multiplying each individual MPPGL by the corresponding
individual CLM for CYPs, which represents CYP-mediated
clearance in liver tissue. As shown in Figure 1, the CLLT
values for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, and 3A4/5 in
HCC patients were dramatically lower than in controls
(P=2.00E-11, 7.88E-5, 1.37E-2, 8.86E-26, 1.01E-7, and
1.37E-2, respectively). Notably, the CLLT for CYP2E1
was significantly greater (P=3.12E-6). However, the CLLT
for CYP2C9 and 2D6 showed no significant difference.
Overall, the CLLT for most CYPs were significantly lower
in HCC patients.

Clearance at the liver level
The mean body weight (BW) of the 105 control
cases was 63.96 (30.00–92.00) kg, and the mean liver
weight (LW) calculated based on the BW of these cases
was 1337.24 (912.31–1688.09) g. The mean BW and LW
of the102 HCC patients were 66.00 (40.00–101.00) kg
and 1103.84 (840.32–1458.57) g, respectively. The LW
of the HCC patients was significantly lower than that of
the controls (P=1.34E-11), while the BW of two groups
showed no significant difference.
According to the BW and LW values determined
above, individual clearance in the liver (CLL) values
were obtained by multiplying each individual LW/BW
by the individual CLLT, which represents CYP-mediated
clearance in the liver. As shown in Figure 1, the CLL
values for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, and 3A4/5
in HCC patients were dramatically lower than in controls
(P=1.04E-13, 1.92E-7, 8.99E-4, 3.77E-27, 6.71E-10, and
3.10E-4, respectively), while the CLL value for CYP2E1
was higher (P=1.27E-3) and the CLL value for CYP2C9

RESULTS
Clearance at the microsomal level
Clearance determined based on “per mg of
microsomal protein” was considered as CLM, which was
calculated based on the ratio of Vmax to Km. The CLM values
for 10 CYPs (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,
2E1, and 3A4/5) were measured in HLMs from both HCC
groups and controls; the results are shown in Figure 1.
Compared with controls, the CLM values for
CYP2C9, 2D6, and 2E1 increased in HCC patients

and 2D6 showed no significant difference. At the liver
level, most CYP CLL values were also markedly lower in
HCC patients.

CYP2C9, 24.026 for CYP2C19, 35.791 for CYP2D6,
4.152 for CYP2E1, and 0.540 for CYP3A4/5. For HCC
patients, the CC was 11.524 for CYP2C19 and 0.474 for
CYP3A4/5. Figure 2 shows that the corrected predictive
hepatic clearance (CL’H) value for all CYPs for control
cases had better accuracy than the CLH values compared
with observed clearance rates in vivo.
Based solely on clearance data for CYP2C19
and 3A4/5 in cirrhotic patients identified in a literature
search, CCs that were suitable for controls and one that
was calculated based on clearance in cirrhotic patients
were introduced into the conventional method to analyze
whether the CCs applied to controls were also suitable for
HCC patients. Cross tabs with χ2 tests for independence
analyses revealed that there were no significant differences
between the HCC and control groups; results are shown
in Table 1. From the examples of these two CYPs, one
conclusion that might be tentatively drawn is that the CCs
that were applied to control cases also were suitable for
HCC patients.
The CL’H values for CYPs in HCC patients are
shown in Figure 1. The CL’H values for CYP1A2, 2A6,
2B6, 2C8, 2C19, and 3A4/5 were significantly reduced
(P=6.14E-13, 3.86E-6, 1.46E-3, 9.98E-27, 1.87E-9, and
1.30E-2, respectively). The most prominent reduction
was observed for the CL’H value for CYP2C8, which was
reduced by 84.8%. Following CYP2C8 were CYP1A2,
2C19, 2B6, 2A6, 3A4/5, and 2C9, for which the CL’H
values were reduced by 60.7%, 57.2%, 43.9%, 38.0%,
19.6%, and 15.7%, respectively. Compared with controls,
the CL’H values for CYP2E1 and 2D6 increased by 40.3%
and 11.9%, respectively, although it should be noted
that the CL’H values for CYP2C9 and 2D6 showed no
significant differences.
For CL’H values, obvious intra-individual variation
could be observed. The maximum to minimum ratios were
83.9, 1036.7, 183.2, 147.4, 56.5, 73.8, 175.7, 60.6, and
11.5 for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1
and 3A4/5, respectively; among these CYPs, CYP2A6
exhibited the greatest intra-individual variation.

In vivo clearance
The mean CO value for control cases, which was
determined based on age and gender, was 5.14 (4.92–6.65)
L/min. The mean QH value calculated based on the CO was
1259.30 (1205.40–1629.25) ml/min. The mean CO and
QH values in HCC patients of 5.83 (4.92–6.65) L/min and
1428.35 (1205.40–1629.25) ml/min were significantly
higher than those in controls (P=1.26E-10 and 1.29E-10,
respectively).
Using the conventional in vitro–in vivo extrapolation
(IVIVE) method, clearance at the in vivo level or hepatic
clearance (CLH) for CYPs in controlled cases and HCC
patients were predicted; results are shown in Figure 1.
Compared with controls, only the CLH for CYP2E1 in
HCC patients was significantly increased (P=1.28E-4),
while the CLH values for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19,
and 3A4/5 were significantly reduced (P=6.14E-13, 3.86E6, 1.46E-3, 9.98E-27, 1.87E-9, and 1.30E-2, respectively)
and the CLH for CYP2C9 and 2D6 did not significantly
change.
To evaluate the predictive performance, the
accuracy of the predicted CLH values for CYPs in control
cases were compared with the observed clearance in vivo;
results are shown in Figure 2. The AFEs were 0.231 for
CYP1A2, 0.186 for CYP2A6, 0.007 for CYP2B6, 0.053
for CYP2C8, 0.391 for CYP2C9, 0.042 for CYP2C19,
0.028 for CYP2D6, 0.241 for CYP2E1, and 1.854 for
CYP3A4/5, which demonstrated that only the CLH for
CYP3A4/5 was correct. To test the accuracy of each
individual measurement, the IFE was calculated. Our
findings suggested that the CLH value for CYP3A4/5
matched most closely with its clearance in vivo, for which
58 (55.2%) of the cases were within a 2-fold error range.
After CYP3A4/5, the CLH value for CYP2C9 matched
best with its clearance in vivo, for which 28 (26.7%) of
the cases were within a 2-fold error range.
No data on the in vivo clearance for CYPs in HCC
patients was identified in a literature search, and only data
regarding the clearance for CYP2C19 (67±40 ml/min) and
CYP3A4/5 (319.49±154.42 ml/min) in liver cirrhosis were
queried. Therefore, the CLH values for CYP2C19 and 3A4/5
predicted using the conventional IVIVE method for HCC
patients were compared with the observed clearance in
cirrhotic patients; our findings revealed that the AFE values
for CYP2C19 and 3A4/5 were 0.087 and 2.111, respectively.
To obtain more accurate measurements of the
CLH value for CYPs, the CCs of different CYPs were
introduced into the conventional IVIVE method. The CC
was the inverse of the corresponding AFE. For control
cases, the CC was 4.334 for CYP1A2, 5.369 for CYP2A6,
139.371 for CYP2B6, 18.938 for CYP2C8, 2.558 for

Bottom-up changes in CYP clearance
Figure 1 illustrates bottom-up changes in CYP
clearance both in vitro and in vivo in patients with HCC
compared with control patients. At each step, changes in
the clearance values for CYPs differed. Notably, at each
level (microsome, liver tissue, liver, and in vivo), CYP2E1
clearance was significantly increased, while the clearance
values for CYP1A2, 2C8, and 2C19 were significantly
reduced. The clearance values for CYP2A6, 2B6, and
3A4/5 showed no change at the microsomal level,
although the clearance values at the other three levels were
significantly reduced. The clearance values for CYP2C9
and 2D6 at the microsomal level were markedly increased,
while those at the other three levels showed no change.

Factors that impact the in vivo clearance

three drugs in liver cirrhosis had been performed [11].
Similarly, another previously attempt collected a series
of parameters (e.g. CLM, Vmax, Km, and MPPGL) reported
in the literature to predict the effects of liver cirrhosis on
drug clearance [9]. Herein, we report the first attempt to
predict the clearances for CYPs at different levels (e.g.,
liver tissue, liver, and in vivo) in HCC patients and to
investigate the effects of HCC on the clearances for CYPs
at different levels. Additionally, in our present study, we
performed in vitro studies of each individual using 102
HLMs of HCC patients, determined the MPPGL of each
individual, and recorded and saved other physiological and
pathological parameters from each patient. Therefore, we
could not only explore the reasons for these changes, but
also revealed intra-individual variations in the clearances
for CYPs at the microsome, liver tissue, liver, and in vivo
levels.
Several previous studies have reported that the
clearance values for several CYPs–CYP1A2, 2A6, 2D6,
2C19, 2E1 and 3A–were decreased [5, 12–17]. However,
we found that the CLM values for CYP2C9, 2D6 and 2E1
were significantly greater. This inconsistency could be
due in part to the fact that these earlier studies focused
on patients with simple cirrhosis who did not have
accompanying HCC. Additionally, another study found
that CYP2A6 clearance was reduced in patients with
either moderate or severe alcoholic liver disease, but
not in those with only mild disease [17]. By contrast,
our present study showed that CYP2A6 clearances were
not altered in the fibrosis or cirrhosis subgroups of HCC
patients. These different characteristics identified in our
present study suggest that a special reference standard may
be essential for personalizing treatments of HCC patients
with cirrhosis.
To the best of our knowledge, this present study was
the first extensive to measure microsomal protein content
in a large number of HCC patients. Compared with
controls [39.60 (9.90–127.90) mg/g] [10], the MPPGL
values [28.85 (7.60–93.60) mg/g] were significantly
reduced in HCC patients (P=1.48E-5). Because of the
reduced MPPGL, the CLM for CYP2A6, 2B6, and 3A4/5
showed no change, but the CLLT values were significantly
reduced. The CLM values for CYP2C9 and 2D6 were
markedly increased, while that of CLLT showed no
change. Meanwhile, because of the markedly reduced
LW in HCC patients, the CLL was more significantly
reduced compared with the CLLT. However, because of the
elevated CO and QH of HCC patients, the CLH was less
significantly reduced compared with the CLL. As a result
of this bottom-up approach, a greater understanding of the
changes in clearance values for CYPs at various levels in
HCC patients became possible.
The effects of CYP genetic polymorphisms on
the clearances for CYPs in vivo were analyzed and we
found that only 5 of 24 mutations, including CYP1A2
(-163C>A), CTP2B6 (516G>T), CYP2D6 (100C>T),

To further assess the effects of disease progression
on in vivo clearance, HCC patients were categorized into
fibrosis and cirrhosis subgroups based on their histological
diagnosis. The results found that only the CL’H for
CYP2D6 was significantly different between the fibrosis
and cirrhosis groups, and was increased by 88.3% in
patients with cirrhosis (Figure 3A).
The impact of genetic polymorphisms on the in vivo
clearance for CYPs was also assessed; no genetic influence
and less than 7 polymorphic individuals were not displayed.
As shown in (Figure 3B–3F), the CL’H value for CYP1A2
was influenced by CYP1A2 (-163C>A). The CL’H values for
CYP2B6 differed by the genotype of CYP2B6 (516G>T).
The CL’H values for CYP2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5 were
influenced by CYP2D6 (100C>T), CYP2E1 (-333T>A), and
CYP3A5 (6986A>G), respectively.
The influence of gender, age, smoking and alcohol
on the in vivo clearance for CYPs was also analyzed and
found that smoking and alcohol consumption influenced
the CL’H for CYP2D6, as shown in (Figure 3G and 3H).
Compared with nonsmokers, the CL’H for CYP2D6 was
significantly lower for smokers. Alcohol consumption
significantly reduced the CL’H for CYP2D6. Gender and
age had no influence on the in vivo clearances for CYPs.
Together, our findings indicated that only CL’H for
CYP2D6 was easily influenced by disease progression,
smoking and alcohol consumption, and only genetic
mutations in CYP1A2 (-163C>A), CYP2B6 (516G>T),
CYP2D6 (100C>T), CYP2E1 (-333T>A), and CYP3A5
(6986A>G) had clear effects on the in vivo clearance for
corresponding CYP.

DISCUSSION
This represents the first extensive study to test the
clearances for 10 CYPs in vitro and in vivo using 102 liver
samples from patients with HCC accompanied by fibrosis
or cirrhosis. We found that compared with controls the
CLM values increased for CYP2C9, 2D6 and 2E1, while
the values for CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C19 decreased and the
values for CYP2A6, 2B6 and 3A4/5 were similar. MPPGL
values corresponding with an unprecedented large number
samples were first determined, which were significantly
lower compared with controls [28.85 (7.60–93.60) mg/g vs
39.60 (9.90–127.90) mg/g] [10]. Based on changes in both
physiological (e.g. MPPGL, LW, CO, and QH) and enzyme
kinetics (e.g. Vmax, Km and CLM) parameters, the altered
in vivo clearances for CYPs were identified. Compared
with controls, the in vivo clearances for CYP1A2, 2A6,
2B6, 2C8, 2C19, 3A4/5 were significantly decreased, the
clearance for CYP2E1 was markedly increased, while the
clearances for CYP2C9 and 2D6 showed no change.

groups, an attempt to predict the pharmacokinetics of

CYP2E1 (-333T>A) and CYP3A5 (6986A>G) had clear
effects on the clearances for CYPs in vivo.
To further verify the factors that influence CYPs
clearances in vivo in HCC, we investigated the effects of
general factors on CYP clearances. We found no obvious
effect of gender and age on all CYPs clearances in vivo,
no obvious effect of smoking and drinking on most CYP
clearances, with the exceptions of CYP2D6. Although the
CL’H value for CYP2D6 were higher in non-smokers and
non-drinkers, these factors were not likely to be related

to clearance changes in patients. Indeed, the HCC group
in this present study included more smokers and drinkers
compared with the control group, and the CL’H value for
CYP2D6 for these patients were higher.
In summary, the bottom-up approach allowed
us to predict pharmacokinetics in patients with HCC
accompanied by fibrosis or cirrhosis and explored the
reasons for changes in CYPs clearance at different
levels. Because dosing recommendations are extremely
limited and imprecise in HCC patients, this present

study may provide important data to help clinicians
to adjust their prescriptions for a wide range of drugs
that are administrated to HCC patients. Because of the
dramatically increased clearance for CYP2E1 in HCC
patients, which metabolizes nitrosamine compounds into
strong carcinogens, our observations may also aid further
studies of the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis in
HCC patients. Because the clearance values in vivo for
CYPs in the present paper is predicted, the accuracy of
these predictions needs to be validated in future studies in
HCC patients.

ml for CYP2D6 and 3A4/5; 0.5 mg protein/ml for 2B6,
2C8, 2C9, and 2C19), 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
with 1mM NADPH and seven or eight concentrations
of substrate (6.25-800μM for phenacetin, 0.156-20μM
for coumarin, 7.8-500μM for bupropion, 2.5-80μM for
paclitaxel, 31.25-2000μM for tolbutamide, 3.9-500μM
for omeprazole, 0.625-960μM for dextromethorphan,
7.8-1000μM for chlorzoxazone, and 3.9-200μM for
midazolam). The mixtures were pre-incubated for 5
min at 37°C. Optimal incubation times were as follows:
30 min for phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin
7-hydroxylation, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation;
60 min for bupropion 4-hydroxylation, and tolbutamide
4-hydroxylation; 90 min for omeprazole 5-hydroxylation;
120 min for paclitaxel 6-hydroxylation; 20 min for
dextromethorphan O-demethylation; and 5 min for
midazolam 1′-hydroxylation. Reactions were terminated
by adding 20 μl ice-cold acetonitrile or 1 ml ethylacetate
or perchloric acid. Metabolites were identified by HPLCUV or HPLC-FLD. The Michaelis–Menten constant
(Km) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of each CYP
were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
CLM was calculated based on the ratio of Vmax-to-Km.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human liver samples
All non-tumor liver tissues were obtained from
patients who had undergone surgical resection at Henan
Provincal People’s Hospital or Henan Provincal Tumor
Hospital between March 2012 and July 2014; informed
consent was obtained from each patient. Approvals
for tissue collection and in vitro metabolism studies
were obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of
Zhengzhou University. This research was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
HBV- or HCV-infected liver tissues (102 samples)
were obtained from patients with HCC confirmed by
postoperative pathological examination. Liver samples
were classified as either having fibrosis or cirrhosis based
on a histological diagnosis. As mentioned previously
[18], 105 larger quantity of liver samples derived from
123 liver samples with normal function identified by
histological diagnosis were collected from subjects with
liver hemangioma, metastatic carcinoma, cholelithiasis, or
gallbladder cancer for use as normal liver control tissues.

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from human
liver tissues using a genomic DNA purification kit
(QIAGEN Translational Medicine Co., Suzhou, China).
Polymorphisms in 10 CYPs with frequencies of more than
1% in the Chinese sample set were investigated. A total
of 20 allelic mutations determined by mass spectrometry
and the alleles CYP3A4 (20230G>A), CYP1A2 (3860G>A), and CYP2B6 (516G>T) genotyped by PCR
sequencing were performed by the LIUHE HUADA
Genomics Technology Co., (Beijing, China). The alleles
CYP2E1*1C/*1D were genotyped using two-step PCR.

Microsome preparation
Human liver microsomes (HLMs) were prepared by
differential centrifugation as previously described [10].
Microsomal protein concentrations were measured using
the Bradford method [19]. The MPPGL contents were
determined as previously described [10].

Clearance at microsomal level (CLM)
The drugs used for the enzymatic assays are
probe substrates. Most CYP isoform-specific substrates
and metabolite (7′-hydroxycoumarin, bupropion,
hydroxybupropion, tolbutamide, 4′-hydroxytolbutamide,
omeprazole, 5′-hydroxyomeprazole, dextromethorphan,
O-demethylation dextrorphan, chlorzoxazone, 6-hydroxy­
chl­orzoxazone, and 1′-hydroxylation midazolam) were
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Paclitaxel and 6-hydroxylpaclitaxel were purchased
from Cayman Co. (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Phenacetin,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In vivo data collection
A PUBMED search or articles published from
1975 to 2015 was performed to collect information
on the pharmacokinetics of 9 probe drugs for CYPs in
humans; detailed information was summarized in Table 2.
For the clearance of bupropion and chlorzoxazone, no
“intravenous infusion” data was identified, so apparent
oral clearance was used.

If multiple published studies about the plasma
unbound fraction (fu, p), blood-to-plasma concentration
ratio (RB), and in vivo clearance for each drug, the overall
mean for these data was used in this present paper. To
determine the overall variability of clearance in vivo from
multiple studies that reported the standard deviation (SD)
for each drug, the overall SD was calculated.
The weighted mean (WX) was calculated using

(Eq. 6)

where QH is determined as 24.5% [22] of the cardiac
output (CO). CO values originated from data for normal
Han Chinese males (n = 783) and females (n = 805); mean
values from each group were selected according to the
age and gender of donors used in this study [23]. A study
by Johnson et al. concluded that the QH in patients with
Child–Pugh scores A for liver cirrhosis had no marked
reduction [9]. Thus, the calculation of QH for HCC patients
in this paper was the same as for controls.

Bottom-up calculations of hepatic clearance
For patients with HCC and controls, the bottomup process using in vitro clearance to extrapolate in vivo
clearance included several equations. In particular, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Eq. 5)

where LW is liver weight and BW is body weight.
According to the actual body weight given for each
patient, the LW was calculated by multiplying the liver
volume (LV) by the liver density, where LV (ml) = 12.5
× BW (kg) + 536.4 [20] and the liver density was 1.001
g/ml [21]. For HCC patients, pathology classifications
indicated that 54 patients were without cirrhosis and 48
had early stage cirrhosis, so the LV of HCC patients was
corrected by multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction
of the control LV (coefficient =1.12) [9].
The clearance for CYPs in vivo (CLH) was next
calculated using the well-stirred model:

Because individual CLM, MPPGL, BW, LW, and QH
values (both HCC and control group) were used to predict
clearance values for CYPs in vivo, the overall accuracy
of the prediction was assessed based on the average folderror (AFE), while the individual accuracy was assessed
based on the individual fold-error (IFE). A two-fold bias
limit corresponds to 0.5–2.0 of AFE and IFE values, which
were estimated as follows:

where N is the number of separate reports in the
literature concerning intravenous drug clearance, except
for bupropion and chlorzoxazone. Because there was
no message about individual data in the literature, the
observed overall mean was used as a reference was used
to calculate the IFE.
To predict the CLH for CYPs more accurately,
a correction coefficient (CC) was introduced into the
conventional in vitro–in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)
method. The CC of one CYP was the inverse of the AFE
of the corresponding CYP.

Statistical analysis
Most data sets were not normally distributed, so
nonparametric methods were generally used for statistical
analyses. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for pairwise
comparisons. A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant (two-tailed). SPSS statistics 17.0
software was used for statistical analyses. All graphs
were generated using the Adobe Photoshop CC 2014,
PowerPoint 2016 and GraphPad Prism version 6.0
software package.
