SUMMARY
Kinases execute pivotal cellular functions and are therefore widely investigated as potential targets
in anticancer treatment. Here we analyze the kinase gene expression profiles of various tumor
types and reveal the wee1 kinase to be overexpressed in glioblastomas. We demonstrate that
WEE1 is a major regulator of the G2 checkpoint in glioblastoma cells. Inhibition of WEE1 by
siRNA or small molecular compound in cells exposed to DNA damaging agents results in
abrogation of the G2 arrest, premature termination of DNA repair, and cell death. Importantly, we
show that the small-molecule inhibitor of WEE1 sensitizes glioblastoma to ionizing radiation in
vivo. Our results suggest that inhibition of WEE1 kinase holds potential as a therapeutic approach
in treatment of glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive human cancers and the most common
primary brain tumor. The median survival of GBM patients is <15 months because this
tumor is inherently resistant to conventional therapy (Stupp et al., 2009). Although the
conventional treatment with surgery, irradiation (IR), and temozolomide (TMZ) postpones
tumor progression and extends patients survival to some extent, these tumors universally
recur and unrelentingly result in patient death. Despite recent advances in understanding the
underlying molecular mechanisms, there has been little improvement in clinical outcome
(Wen and Kesari, 2008).

Manipulation of oncogenic kinase activity has become a therapeutic concept in human
cancer because kinases regulate crucial cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis,
cell metabolism, migration, DNA damage repair, and responses to the microenvironment
(Manning et al., 2002). Several human cancers are considered to be kinase-driven
(Weinstein, 2002; Krause and Van Etten, 2005), and inhibitors of several cancer-driving
kinases are under evaluation as potential therapeutic agents (Cohen, 2002; Vieth et al.,
2005). Most of these inhibitors aim at stagnation of tumor growth by interrupting the
replicative cycle of cancer cells. Examples include inhibitors of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
homologue (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase C (PKC),
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR) (reviewed by Zhang et al., 2009). These therapeutic kinase targets are
mainly deregulated by either mutation, protein fusion or gene overexpression (Krause and
Van Etten, 2005). Thus far, results from clinical trials testing the efficacy of kinase
inhibitors in patients with GBM have been disappointing (Omuro et al., 2007; De Witt
Hamer, 2010).
In this study we focused on the kinase gene expression profile of GBM using publicly
available gene expression data sets to identify additional putative therapeutic targets.

Significance
The resistance of glioblastoma cells to irradiation and chemotherapy is partly due to their
proficient ability to repair treatment-induced DNA damage during the G2 cell-cycle
arrest. Many kinase inhibitors intend to prolong cell-cycle arrest to halt cancer cell
division. Here, we inhibit the WEE1 kinase, a gatekeeper of the DNA damage-induced
G2 arrest, “pushing” glioblastoma cells through the G2 arrest phase and thereby inducing
mitotic catastrophe and cell death. This strategy results in extensive cytotoxicity in vitro
and, more importantly, eradication of irradiated brain tumors in mice, without showing
adverse side effects. Therefore, manipulation of WEE1 activity may prove
therapeutically attractive as a sensitizing approach for glioblastoma treatment.

RESULTS
In Silico Analysis of Microarray Data Identifies Cancer-Specific Kinase Expression Profiles

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify kinase targets, we used a cancer-wide approach and selected 34 cancer-versusnormal data sets (Table S1 available online), including two GBM data sets obtained by
different microarray platforms in distinct laboratories (Bredel et al., 2005; Kotliarov et al.,
2006). Two parameters of gene expression were determined, details of which are described
in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. First, to compare the differential kinase gene
expression of cancer-versus-normal samples among data sets, the fold change was
determined for all genes within a data set. Then, the percentile of fold change was
determined for each kinase within a data set to relate its expression value to all genes in that
data set. This allowed comparison of expression levels of each kinase between data sets.
Second, to compare the frequency at which overexpression occurs in cancer samples
between data sets, the frequency of overexpression was determined for each kinase within
each cancer-versus-normal data set. To recover the human kinome from the genes present in
the data sets, the Entrez GeneIDs of the human protein kinase family (518 kinases) and the
human lipid kinase family (33 kinases) were retrieved (Figures 1A, Figure S1, and Table S2)
(Manning et al., 2002; Peri et al., 2003). The vast majority of kinase genes were represented
on the microarray platforms (Table S1 and Table S2). We found distinct kinase expression

profiles in various cancer types (Figure 1A). Thus, potential therapeutic targets
overexpressed in a specific type of cancer may not necessarily be valid in other cancer types.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To validate our approach, we selected kinases previously demonstrated to be overexpressed
in specific cancers and determined their expression across our kinase profiles (Figure 1B).
Our analysis revealed v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (kit)
to be selectively overexpressed in seminomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which
show clinical response to anti-KIT treatment (Pedersini et al., 2007; Demetri et al., 2002).
Moreover, egfr overexpression was confirmed in head and neck cancers, non-small cell lung
cancers, and renal cell cancers, for which anti-EGFR treatment can prolong overall survival
(Lynch et al., 2004; Agulnik et al., 2007; Ravaud et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although we retrieved the kinase expression profiles of several tumor types, our prime focus
was to identify potential therapeutic targets in glioblastoma. We considered overexpression
at a level surpassing 95% of all genes in a data set as substantial. Additionally, we
considered overexpression in >20% of the patient population as frequent. A listing of nine
kinases was obtained that were both substantially (Figure 2A) and frequently (Figure 2B)
overexpressed in the two available GBM data sets. In previous investigations four of these
nine selected kinases, aurora kinase A (aurka) (Klein et al., 2004), egfr (Nicholas et al.,
2006), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (melk) (Nakano et al., 2008), and cyclindependent kinase 1 (cdc2) (Hodgson et al., 2009), were described as relevantly
overexpressed in human GBM samples, emphasizing the biological plausibility of our
results. The other five kinases were not previously associated with human GBM. pdgfr,
kinase insert domain receptor (kdr), fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (flt4), transforming growth
factor, beta receptor 1 (tgfbr1), and transforming growth factor, beta receptor 2 (tgfbr2) had
been described to be overexpressed in GBM (Rich and Bigner, 2004) but they were not
included in our list. Despite marked overexpression in the two GBM data sets (Table S3 and
Table S4), these kinases did not meet our selection criteria. Given the noise levels in
microarray data, we preferred high specificity over sensitivity.
wee1 mRNA and Protein Are Overexpressed in GBM and Its Expression Level Correlates
with Survival
The individual data for the nine overexpressed kinases retrieved from the GBM studies is
presented in Figures 3A and 3B and Figure S2, according to glioma grade and histological
subtype. To validate the results obtained in silico, we determined mRNA expression of these
kinases in GBM cell lines and primary samples of GBM and normal brain using quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Figure 3C, Table S5, and Table
S6).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because WEE1 kinase plays an important role in controlling the cell-cycle progression
(Russell and Nurse, 1987) and because it topped the ranking of overexpressed kinases
(Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure S2), we further studied its role in GBM. We first determined
the levels of WEE1 protein expression in normal brain and GBM tissue sections using
immunohistochemistry. Consistent with the gene expression data, GBM cell nuclei
contained high levels of WEE1 protein, as compared to non-neoplastic brain regions (Figure
3D).
We then investigated the correlation between wee1 mRNA level and patient survival using
published data from 267 GBM patients (Lee et al., 2008). Expression of wee1 was classified
as high or low, based on whether the values were above or below the median wee1
expression levels, respectively. This showed high tumor wee1 expression to be significantly
correlated with worse patient survival (log rank p < 0.0059), patients with high wee1expressing GBM had a median survival time of 308 days and a 2-year survival rate of 14%

versus a median survival time of 402 days and a 2-year survival rate of 26% for patients
with low wee1-expressing GBM (Figure 3E). wee1 expression level was significantly
associated with patient survival after correction for confounding by age, gender, tumor
recurrence, and prior treatment modalities, in a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards
regression model (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.53–0.89, p = 0.0047 and
Table S7).
Inhibition of WEE1 Abrogates the G2 Checkpoint and Sensitizes GBM Cells to TMZ and IR
In Vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After DNA damage induction, GBM cells mainly arrest in the G2 phase, due to an impaired
G1 checkpoint (Hirose et al., 2001). Indeed, U251MG GBM cells arrested in the G2 phase
after IR and TMZ treatment (Figures 4A and 4C). We then focused on the role of WEE1 in
the G2 checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage. To specifically inhibit WEE1
function, we transfected GBM cells with siRNA directed against the wee1 mRNA. As
determined by quantitative RT-PCR, the wee1 siRNA efficiently knocked down wee1
mRNA levels, as compared to nontargeting control siRNA (Figure S3A). After 48 hr the
transfected cells were either exposed to 6 Gray (Gy) of IR or treated with 100 µMTMZ and
16 hr later cell-cycle distribution was monitored by fluorescence activated cell sorting. DNA
content was monitored by propidium iodide staining and phospho-histone-H3 staining was
used as an indicator of mitotic entry. Knock down of wee1 resulted in significant abrogation
of the IR- and TMZ-induced G2 arrest and decrease in the amount of mitotic cells (Figures
4A and 4C and Figures S3B and S3C). Similar abrogation of the DNA damage-induced
arrest in U251MG cells was achieved by using the WEE1 inhibitor PD0166285 (Wang et
al., 2001) (Figures 4A and4C, Figure S3D, and Figure S4E). Comparative cell-cycle results
were obtained using additional established GBM cell lines (U118MG, U87MG, U373MG)
and primary GBM cells (VU147, VU148, E98) (Figures S3D and S3E). These results
indicate that WEE1 is a major determinant of the DNA damage-inducedG2 arrest in GBM
cells. Importantly, no adverse effects of WEE1 inhibition on cell cycle were observed in
primary human fibroblasts and astrocytes, showing no loss of G1 arrest after exposure to IR
or TMZ in the presence or absence of WEE1 inhibitor or siRNA against wee1 (Figure 4B
and Figures S3D and S3E). Furthermore, no effects of PD0166285 on fibroblasts and
astrocytes were observed by WST-1 cell viability measurements and microscopical
monitoring of cellular morphology (data not shown). Inhibition of WEE1 also reduces
phosphorylation of its downstream substrate CDC2 (Figure 4D and Figure S3F). This
suggests that the inhibitory CDC2 phosphorylation is reduced by inhibition of WEE1 and
thereby the CDC2-mediated G2 arrest is abolished in GBM cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We then investigated the effects of WEE1 inhibition on the viability of cells treated with IR,
TMZ, or both. wee1 silencing by siRNA or WEE1 inhibition by PD0166285 had a
significant sensitizing effect in combination with 6 Gy of IR, 100 µM of TMZ, or both
(Figures 4E and 4F and Figure S3G). At concentrations up to 1 µm, PD0166285 had no
effects on the viability of GBM cells in the absence of IR and TMZ (Figure 4E). In addition,
radiosensitizing effects of PD0166285 in GBM cells could be measured by colony formation
assay (Figure 4G), which correlated with wee1 gene expression levels in the GBM cells.
U373MG cells with a fold change log2 wee1 expression (FC) compared to six nonneoplastic brain samples of 13.0 (see Figure 3C) showed the largest sensitization, with a
sensitizing enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.95, U251MG cells (FC: 9.1, SER: 1.73) and
U118MG cells (FC: 9.2, SER: 1.45) showed intermediate sensitization, whereas U87MG
cells (FC 5.2 that is within the upper threshold for normal expression of FC 6.4 and SER of
1.19) showed the least sensitization (Figure 3C and Figure 4G). In contrast, no correlation
was observed between p53 mutation status and WEE1 inhibitor sensitivity in the GBM cells
analyzed here. However, U87 cells, which express wee1 mRNA levels within the normal

range (Figure 3C and Figure 4G) and express the wild-type p53 (Figure S3H), showed the
least PD0166285-mediated radiosensitization (Figure 4G). There was no significant effect of
PD0166285 on colony formation in non-irradiated GBM cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A subpopulation of GBM cells, the so-called cancer stem-like cells, has been described to be
particularly resistant to chemoand radiotherapy (Bao et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006). In silico
analysis using the ONCOMINE database (Rhodes et al., 2004) showed that wee1 was
overexpressed to an even higher extent in a subpopulation of GBM cells cultured in neural
basal medium (Lee et al., 2006) (Figure S3I). GBM neurospheres formed by such cells
expressed CD133, Nestin, and SOX2 (Figure S3J), putative GBM stem-like cell markers
(Lee et al., 2006). Next, the radiosensitizing effect of WEE1 inhibitor PD0166285 on
primary GBM neurospheres was determined. GBM neurospheres failed to respond to
exposure to IR alone, confirming their radio-resistance (Bao et al., 2006). Importantly,
dramatic cell death was measured when primary GBM neurospheres were exposed to IR in
the presence of PD0166285. Although GBM stem-like cell markers are still subject of
continuous debate (Chen et al., 2010), we isolated primary CD133 positive and negative
GBM cells with high wee1 expression and intermediate wee1 expression, respectively, as
determined by qRT-PCR (Figure S3I). Subsequently we treated the sorted cells with 0.5 µM
of PD0166285 and 6 Gy of IR. After 4 days the radiation-resistant CD133 positive GBM
cells were efficiently killed as determined by WST-1 cell viability assay (Figure 4H). These
results suggest that radiation resistance of GBM stem-like cell populations can be overcome
by WEE1 inhibition in vitro.
Inhibition of WEE1 in Irradiated GBM Cells Leads to Mitotic Catastrophe Due to Residual
DNA Damage
After induction of DNA damage, WEE1 activates and sustains the G2 cell-cycle arrest until
DNA damage is sufficiently repaired (Rowley et al., 1992). Therefore, inhibition of WEE1
should abrogate G2 arrest activation and result in increased amounts of unrepaired DNA
damage in cells prematurely entering mitosis. To determine the effect of WEE1 inhibition
on the rejoining of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and on DSB-induced cell-cycle arrest, we
exposed GBM cells to IR in the presence or absence of the WEE1 inhibitor. IR resulted in
induction of DSBs as evidenced by formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) by a
DSB marker γ-H2AX (Rogakou et al., 1999), and by repair factors ATMp1981, MDC1, and
MRE11 (Goldberg et al., 2003; Lavin, 2007) (Figures 5A and 5B). Phase-contrast time-lapse
imaging of the U251MG cells at 10-min intervals showed that IR induced a considerable
delay in the onset of mitosis (Figures 5C and 5D). In contrast, cells irradiated in the presence
of PD0166285 failed to delay their mitotic entry (Figures 5C and 5D), in agreement with the
role of WEE1 in activating and maintaining the G2 arrest.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the absence of a functional G2 arrest, irradiated GBM cells may not be capable of
repairing the DNA damage before entering mitosis, leading to mitotic catastrophe. We
irradiated GBM cells and then time-lapse imaged the cells in the presence or absence of
WEE1 inhibitor (Movie S1). Cells were fixed and stained for γ-H2AX and MDC1 and
analyzed for completion of mitosis by fluorescence microscopy. Exposure to IR alone
resulted in only a few residual DSBs in the daughter cell nuclei, indicating near-complete
DSB repair before the cells entered mitosis (Figures 5E and 5G). In contrast, cells irradiated
in the presence of WEE1 inhibitor presented their daughter cells with considerable amount
of unrepaired DSBs (Figures 5F and 5G). Additionally, the presence of PD0166285 resulted
in largely fragmented nuclei of the daughter cells (Figure 5F and Movie S1), indicative of
mitotic catastrophe due to DNA fragments devoid of centromeres, which can not be properly
segregated during mitosis (Loffler et al., 2006). Together, these results support the concept
that G2 abrogation by WEE1 inhibition results in mitotic catastrophe due to unrepaired
DSBs that explains the radiosensitizing properties of the WEE1 inhibitor.

WEE1 Inhibition Enhances Radiosensitivity in Orthotopic GBM Models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To compare the antitumor efficacy of short hairpin-mediated wee1 knock down alone or in
combination with IR in vivo, we first used a bioluminescent orthotopic model of human
U251-FlucmCherry cells (U251-FM) (Candolfi et al., 2007). U251-FM cells were
transduced with lentivectors encoding a control shRNA or a shRNA directed against wee1
(shWEE11702). First, the efficiency of wee1 knock down and reduction of cell viability in
response to wee1 knock down after IR-mediated DNA damage was determined in these cells
(Figure S4A). Second, control or shWEE1 transduced U251-FM cells were implanted in the
brain of nude mice. The growth of tumors was monitored weekly by bioluminescence
imaging. Two weeks after intracranial injection of the transduced cells, 50% of the mice in
each group were exposed to a single dose of 6 Gy. In mice injected with U251-FM cells
expressing shControl strong tumor progression was observed in both irradiated and nonirradiated groups at 6 weeks after injection of the cells (Figures 6A and 6B). Similarly, the
nonirradiated U251-FM-shWEE1 cells showed strong increase in bioluminescence signal
after 6 weeks, whereas mice injected with U251-FM-shWEE1 cells showed significant
tumor regression after IR at 6 weeks after injection (Figures 6A and 6B). Tumor burden was
markedly reduced in irradiated mice carrying shWEE1 transduced cells (Figure 6C).
Survival analysis showed a significant (p = 0.001) advantage for combining irradiation with
wee1 knock down (Figure 6D). These results indicate that wee1 knockdown sensitizes
U251-FM GBMs to IR in vivo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the pharmacological characteristics and anti-tumor efficacy of PD0166285 on
GBM outcome in vivo, we first implanted GBM cells subcutaneously (SC) into nude mice
and determine the PD0166285 dosage sufficient to inhibit WEE1 activity in vivo. Mice were
injected with various doses of PD0166285 (0, 20, 100, 200, or 400 µM in 100 µl) 20 days
after tumor cells implantation. No adverse side effects were observed at the concentrations
used. Tumors were removed 24 hr later and analyzed for inhibition of WEE1-mediated
CDC2 phosphorylation by western blotting (Figure S4B). A single injection of 20 µM of the
WEE1 inhibitor considerably reduced the CDC2 phosphorylation and was used in further
experiments. Next, U251-FM human GBM cells were injected intracranially into nude mice.
Mice with established GBMs were treated daily with PD0166285 or phosphate buffer
solution (PBS) control via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection starting at day 14 after injection
of the GBM cells. At day 15, the mice were sham irradiated or exposed to a single dose of 6
Gy. The results showed strong tumor progression in both irradiated and non-irradiated mock
treated mice at 6 weeks after injection of the cells (Figures 6E and 6F). Similarly, the nonirradiated PD0166285 treated mice showed strong increase in tumor signal after 6 weeks. In
contrary, irradiated mice treated with PD0166285 showed significant tumor regression 6
weeks after tumor injection (Figures 6E and 6F). Additionally, tumor burden was markedly
reduced in this animal group (Figure 6G). Survival analysis showed a significant (p = 0.001)
advantage for combining irradiation with PD0166285 (Figure 6H). These results indicate
that pharmacological targeting of WEE1 sensitizes U251-FM GBM tumors to IR in vivo.
To confirm these results in an independent orthotopic GBM model we used the E98 mouse
model (Claes et al., 2008) because it displays a highly invasive phenotype characteristic for
human GBM. We verified that WEE1 protein was overexpressed in this model by
immunohistochemistry on tumor sections (Figure S5A). To improve tumor detection, the
E98 cells were transduced to stably express Fluc and mCherry (E98-FM). To determine
whether wee1 knock down by shRNAs caused radiosensitization in vivo, E98-FM cells were
transduced with lentivectors encoding shControl, or shWEE11704 directed against wee1. The
efficiency of wee1 knock down and reduction of cell viability in response to WEE1 knock
down combined with IR was verified in these cells (Figure S5B). We then stereotactically
injected E98-FM-shControl or E98-FM-shWEE1 cells into nude mice. After 10 days the
mice were divided into two treatment groups, with and without IR. In line with the U251Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15.

FM model, irradiated mice carrying shWEE1 transduced E98-FM tumors showed markedly
reduced tumor burden (Figures 7A and 7B), and their survival was significantly prolonged
as compared to other treatment groups (Figure 7C).
Next we determined the pharmacological effects of PD0166285 in the E98 GBM model. In
line with the U251-FM model, mice treated with PD0166285 and irradiation showed
considerably reduced tumor burden (Figure 7D) and their survival was significantly
prolonged as compared to other treatment groups (Figure 7E). Both groups of mice
subjected to IR or PD0166285 monotherapy showed intermediate results. On day 23, all
remaining mice were sacrificed and histological analysis of the brains was performed.
Importantly, E98 GBM tumors were undetectable in any mice that were alive after the IR/
PD0166285 combination treatment. This could not be explained by lack of tumor growth
before the treatment, given the effects in mice without treatment and clear changes of brain
structure indicating that tumor growth had in fact occurred (Figure 7C). The sham-treated
mice and the mice treated with IR or WEE1 inhibitor alone, showed typical infiltrative GBM
growth, although a significant beneficial effect of irradiation was observed (Figure 7D). This
in vivo therapeutic response to PD0166285 in combination with irradiation and the lack of
adverse side effects underline the potential of WEE1 kinase inhibition in GBM treatment.
Analysis of “Push” and “Pull” Kinase Inhibitors on DNA Damage Repair in GBM Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

WEE1 is part of an intricate network of kinases and phosphatases regulating the G2
checkpoint (Figure 8A) (Elder et al., 2001; Katayama et al., 2005; Kim and Ferrell, 2007;
O’Connell et al., 1997; van Vugt et al., 2004; Watanabe et al., 2004). Several kinase
inhibitors were developed to “pull back” the cancer cells during cell-cycle arrest, aiming at
stagnation of tumor growth, examples include inhibitors targeting PLK1 and AKT. In
contrast, other kinase inhibitors, such as those targeting CHK1 and WEE1, can abrogate the
G2 arrest and push cancer cells into premature mitosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We first determined the effect of the selected inhibitors on CDC2 phosphorylation by
western blotting (Figure 8B). Irradiation of GBM cells resulted in increased phosphorylation
of CDC2, which was not affected by inhibitors of PLK1 or AKT, but significantly reduced
by inhibitors of CHK1 and WEE1 (Figure 8B). We then analyzed the effects of these
inhibitors on the cell cycle and radiosensitization of GBM cells (Figures 8C and 8D). The
inhibition of CHK1 and WEE1 kinases resulted in abrogation of IR-induced G2 arrest
(Figure 8C). In contrast, the inhibitors of PLK1 and AKT increased the fraction of cells in
the G2 phase as compared to cells treated with IR alone (Figure 8C). We then determined the
effects of the different kinase inhibitors on radiosensitivity of GBM cells (Figure 8D). A
significant reduction in viability was observed when cells were irradiated in the presence of
CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitors. In marked contrast, inhibition of AKT failed to increase
sensitivity of GBM cells to IR and inhibition of PLK1 exhibited radioprotective properties.
G2 checkpoint abrogation by WEE1 inhibition resulted in mitotic catastrophe due to
unrepaired DSBs (Figure 5 and Movie S1). Similar results were obtained when GBM cells
were irradiated in the presence of CHK1 inhibitor (Movie S2). In contrast, incubation of
cells in the presence of inhibitors of PLK1 and AKT for 6 hr after irradiation failed to affect
the mitotic entry, as compared to cells exposed to IR alone (Movie S2).
We then assessed the amount of residual DNA damage in cells that underwent mitosis after
exposure to IR and the different inhibitors (Figures 8E and 8F). Daughter cells originating
from cells irradiated in the presence of CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitors contained a large
number of unrepaired DSBs indicating incomplete DNA repair (Figures 8E and 8F). In
contrast, the combination of IR with PLK1 and AKT inhibitors did not result in an increase
of unrepaired DSBs in the daughter cells, suggesting that DNA repair was near-complete

before the cells entered mitosis (Figures 8E and 8F). In agreement with the effects of
inhibitors of PLK1, AKT, CHK1, and WEE1 on CDC2 phosphorylation (Figure 8B), a
considerable delay in the onset of mitosis was measured in the GBM cells treated with
inhibitors of PLK1 and AKT—the “cell-cycle pullers” (Figure 8G and Movie S2). In
contrast, cells irradiated in the presence of inhibitors of CHK1 and WEE1—the cell-cycle
pushers—failed to delay the mitotic entry (Figure 8G and Movie S2). Thus, the strategy
assuming abrogation rather than prolongation of the G2 checkpoint may be more effective in
increasing sensitivity of GBM cells to DNA damage in vitro.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Three main findings are put forward by the present study. First, we have identified a GBMspecific kinase expression profile, providing a list of substantially and frequently
overexpressed kinases involved in GBM signaling pathways. In addition, analysis of other
cancer kinase expression profiles verified previously known overexpressed kinases and
provided a platform for retrieval of kinase treatment targets. Implications consist of a further
advancement of our understanding of oncogenic kinase signaling and a possibility for
rational planning of future kinase inhibitory strategies, although, clearly, kinase
overexpression is not the only mode of deregulation. Indeed WEE1 activity has been
described to be regulated by protein ubiquitination, proteolytic degradation, and
phosphorylation (Watanabe et al., 2004; Rothblum-Oviatt et al., 2001; Kim and Ferrell,
2007; van Vugt et al., 2004; O’Connell et al., 1997; Katayama et al., 2005; McGowan and
Russell, 1993). Second, the list of differentially expressed kinases in GBM was spearheaded
by wee1 that we now present as a potential treatment target. Third, we postulate that the
profound overexpression of wee1 in treatment-resistant GBM contributes to efficient DNA
repair at the G2 checkpoint. Moreover, the subpopulation of so-called GBM stem-like cells,
that are more resistant to irradiation and chemotherapeutics (Bao et al., 2006; Liu et al.,
2006) and were described to reside in a low proliferative state in vascular niches (Calabrese
et al., 2007), were sensitized by WEE1 inhibition, indicating a major role for WEE1 in
conferring radio-resistance of these cells. Our findings support the concept that cancer cells
with sub-lethal DNA damage induced by conventional radio- and chemotherapy can be
catastrophically pushed into premature mitosis by inhibition of WEE1 activity.

The kinases identified as most frequently overexpressed are often involved in cell-cycle
regulation. DNA damaging agents, such as those used during standard GBM treatment,
induce arrest in G1 or G2 phases (Iliakis et al., 2003; Hirose et al., 2001). These arrests are
brought about by checkpoint mechanisms that provide time for repair of sub-lethal DNA
damage before resuming the cell cycle (Branzei and Foiani, 2008). Due to defective TP53
signaling, many cancer cells lack the functional G1 arrest and depend to a greater extent on
the G2 checkpoint in response to DNA damage (Kawabe, 2004). Therefore, abrogation of
the G2 checkpoint, inducing premature mitotic entry and subsequent cell death, has emerged
as a potential therapeutic strategy (Kawabe, 2004; Vogelstein et al., 2000). Inhibitors of the
G2 checkpoint activation such as caffeine, pentoxifylline and the CHK1 kinase inhibitor
UCN-01 have been shown to push cells containing residual unrepaired DNA damage into
premature mitosis, resulting in sensitization to DNA-damaging agents (Reinhardt et al.,
2007; Russell et al., 1996; Sarkaria et al., 1999).
WEE1 kinase is involved in the G2 checkpoint control by acting directly on CDC2, the
driving force for G2 progression (McGowan and Russell, 1993; O’Connell et al., 1997;
Parker and Piwnica-Worms, 1992; Rowley et al., 1992; Russell and Nurse, 1987). WEE1
was identified through genetic studies of cell size control and cell-cycle progression in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Nurse, 1975). Subsequent work established WEE1 as a
tyrosine kinase belonging to the Ser/Thr family of protein kinases (Russell and Nurse, 1987;

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15.

Mir et al.

Featherstone and Russell, 1991). WEE1 catalyzes the inhibitory tyrosine (Y15)
phosphorylation of CDC2/cyclin B kinase, so that the G2/M transition is prevented (Russell
and Nurse, 1987; Parker and Piwnica-Worms, 1992; McGowan and Russell, 1993).
From several arguments it seems reasonable that inhibition of WEE1 can be a safe
therapeutic strategy. First, many cancer cells, and GBM cells in particular, harbor p53
mutations, which render these cells more dependent on the G2 checkpoint (Kawabe, 2004;
Wang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2002). Second, inhibition of WEE1 affected neither normal
human fibroblasts nor astrocytes in terms of DNA cytometry and cellular morphology.
Third, no acute adverse effects were detected in mice after high dose injection of WEE1
inhibitor in our dose-effect experiment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Deregulation of the TP53 pathway occurs in 87% of GBMs by various mechanisms,
including cdkn2a deletion or mutation, mdm2 and mdm4 amplification and P53 deletion or
mutation (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). Although IR sensitization
mediated by WEE1 inhibition has been described to be dependent on TP53 activity (Wang
et al., 2001; Li et al., 2002), we did not see such a correlation. However, a functional G1
arrest with concurrent wild-type TP53 expression in fibroblasts and astrocytes is likely to
explain the absence of cell death after induction of DNA damage by IR and WEE1
inhibition in these non-neoplastic cells, whereas the level of WEE1 inhibitor sensitivity in
G2-dependent GBM cells depends on the level of wee1 expression.
Overexpression of wee1 was described previously for several types of cancer. The
expression of wee1 was found to be upregulated in poorly differentiated and more advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (Masaki et al., 2003). Further, WEE1 inhibition has been
suggested as anticancer therapy based on findings in cell lines from melanoma, cervical
carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma (Hashimoto et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2001; Wang et al., 2004). Of note, our stringent in silico analysis on data of primary normal
versus cancer tissues indicates overexpression of wee1 in most cancer types (for 27 of 35
data sets; Figure 2A). However, the top-ranking wee1 expression levels in GBM were not
reached by any of the other cancer types analyzed. Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma,
(non-)seminoma, and colon carcinoma also showed high wee1 mRNA expression levels,
whereas the other cancer types mostly showed moderate overexpression as compared to the
relevant non-neoplastic control tissues.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, monotherapeutic inhibition of WEE1 also resulted in a beneficial response of
GBMs in mice. An explanation for this effect can be that DNA damage in GBM cells is not
only induced by cancer therapy but that the DNA integrity of these cells is continuously
threatened by inherent genomic instability (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2008).
Like the PLK1 and AKT inhibitors, many of the small molecule inhibitors or antibodies
have been developed to restrain cancer growth by halting cell replication. Efficacy of this
strategy has been demonstrated (Agulnik et al., 2007; Lynch et al., 2004; Ravaud et al.,
2008; Vieth et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). However, results of the present study stress the
importance of proper treatment timing when combining such agents with DNA damageinduction. Inhibition of CHK1 and WEE1 has clear radiosensitizing effects, suggesting that
promoting, rather than halting the cell-cycle progression should be considered as radiosensitizing strategy in glioblastoma. Effects of CHK1 inhibitors were analyzed in various
tumor models (Bao et al., 2006; Hirose et al., 2001; Reinhardt et al., 2007; Sidi et al., 2008),
revealing significant toxicity to non-neoplastic cells, which might be explained by
involvement of CHK1 in activation of both the G2 and the G1 cell-cycle checkpoints
(Kortmansky et al., 2005; Shieh et al., 2000). Here we show that inhibition of WEE1 by

PD0166285 does not result in measurable toxic side effects at therapeutically relevant doses
in mice, which may be explained by its G2-specific cell-cycle interference.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, we revealed a dominant role of the WEE1 kinase in controlling the G2
checkpoint in GBM and designated this protein as a possible target in treatment-resistant
glioblastoma. We showed that GBM cells can be pushed into mitotic catastrophe by WEE1
inhibition after DNA damaging radio- or chemotherapy. Our results suggest that inhibition
of WEE1 activity may prove effective in enhancing GBM treatment.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Compounds
The WEE1 inhibitor PD0166285 (Pfizer, Ann Arbor, MI) was diluted in PBS. Inhibitors of
PLK1 (BI-2536) and PI3K/AKT (LY-294002) (Axon Medchem, Groningen, the
Netherlands) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). Inhibitors (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were diluted in DMSO. Temozolomide
(Schering Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) was diluted in DMSO, prepared freshly each time, and
used at a final concentration of 100 µM.
Tissue Samples and Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surgical samples were obtained from four glioma patients with World Health Organization
(WHO) grade 2, five patients with WHO grade 3, and 14 patients with glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) after informed consent and approval by the Hospital Medical Ethical
Committee (Table S5). Furthermore, 16 GBM cell lines were included (Table S6). Cancer
stem-like cell cultures were derived from patients with GBM (VUmc, the Netherlands). The
stem-like cells were isolated and cultured as described elsewhere (Lee et al., 2006).
RNA Isolation and Interference
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), according the
manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and quantity of the RNA was analyzed by
photospectrometry. RNA interference was carried out by transfecting siRNAs (50 nM,
QIAGEN). Lentivectors encoding validated wee1 shRNAs (Sigma-Aldrich; WEE1
Reference Sequence NM_003390; shRNA reference numbers TRCN0000001702 and
TRCN0000001704, referred to as shWEE11702 and shWEE11704, respectively), were
produced and used to transduce U251-FM and E98-FM cells. The SHC002 scrambled
shRNA construct (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a negative control.

Immunofluorescence Staining, Immunohistochemistry, and Western Blotting
Cell cultures were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature
(RT), permeabilized using 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at RT. The following
antibodies were used: rabbit anti-MDC1 (A300-051A, Bethyl Laboratories), mouse anti-γH2AX (05-636, Millipore), rabbit anti-MRE11 (de Jager et al., 2001), mouse antiATMpthr1981 (4526S, Cell Signaling Technology) goat anti-mouse-Cy3 (115-165-166), and
goat anti-rabbit-FITC (111-095-144) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Immunohistochemical
staining was carried out as described previously (Yoshida et al., 2004). Western blotting was
carried out with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-WEE1 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-CDC2 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit antiCDC2pY15 (1:2000, Abcam), mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000, Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-p53
(1:1000, NeoMarkers).

Irradiation, Live-Cell Imaging, and Fluorescence Imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 1.5 × 105 cells were plated in 25 cm2 culture flasks and incubated for 24 hr
in standard medium. Next, required inhibitors were added for 30 min and cells were exposed
to gamma-irradiation. Next, cells were mounted under Leica IRBE inverted fluorescence
microscope (Leica Microsystems) in an incubator with adjustable CO2 concentration, at
37°C. Positions of imaged cells were saved using custom-written software. Phase-contrast,
time-lapse movies were acquired at 10-min intervals for required period of time. If required,
after imaging, cells were fixed, stained for indicated proteins, and imaged using fluorescence
microscopy.
In Vivo Analysis Using the U251 and E98 Orthotopic GBM Mouse Models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All experiments on mice were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at
Radboud University (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), VUmc (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), or
Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), and were carried out in accordance to their
guidelines and regulations. E98 tumor fragments (8 mm3) were grafted subcutaneously in
the flank of Balb/C nude mice (n = 10). For the experiments with the orthotopic tumors,
U251MG and E98 cells were transduced to express Fluc and mCherry, to generate U251FM and E98-FM cells. One million cells were injected intracranially. Starting at 12 days
after tumor inoculation, mice received the WEE1 inhibitor PD0166285 via intraperitoneal
injections (500 µl of a 20 µM solution diluted in NaCl) or vehicle for 5 consecutive days.
On days 10–15, mice were irradiated with a single dose of irradiation.
