ABSTRACT
The involvement of ErbB family members in breast cancer progression and
metastasis has been demonstrated by many studies. However, the downstream
effectors that mediate their migratory and invasive responses have not been fully
explored. In this study, we show that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a key
effector of EGFR and HER2 signaling in human breast carcinoma. We found that PYK2
is activated by both EGF and heregulin (HRG) in breast cancer cells, and positively
regulates EGF/HRG-induced cell spreading, migration and invasion. PYK2 depletion
markedly affects ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in response to EGF/HRG as well
as to IL8 treatment. Importantly, PYK2 depletion also reduced EGF/HRG-induced
MMP9 and IL8 transcription, while IL8 inhibition abrogated EGF-induced MMP9
transcription and attenuated cell invasion. IL8, which is transcriptionally regulated by
STAT3 and induces PYK2 activation, prolonged EGF-induced PYK2, STAT3 and ERK1/2
phosphorylation suggesting that IL8 acts through an autocrine loop to reinforce EGFinduced signals. Collectively our studies suggest that PYK2 is a common downstream
effector of ErbB and IL8 receptors, and that PYK2 integrates their signaling pathways
through a positive feedback loop to potentiate breast cancer invasion. Hence, PYK2
could be a potential therapeutic target for a subset of breast cancer patients.

these two receptors actively function as heterodimers. In
fact, ErbB2, which dimerizes with other ErbB receptors,
functions as a signal amplifier by inhibiting the rate
of growth factor dissociation as well as of receptors
endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, and by enhancing
the recycling of internalized receptors back to the cell
surface [7, 8]. ErbB2/3 heterodimer is known to induce
strong mitogenic response [9], and ErbB2 in general, plays
a critical role in heregulin (HRG)-induced breast cancer
cell growth and migration [10]. Recent studies suggest
that ErbB2 as well as EGFR can also be trans-activated
by cytokines including Interleukin-8 (IL8; CXCL8) [11],
a neutrophil chemoattractant and an angiogenic factor with
tumor promoting properties [12, 13].
IL8 is secreted by cells of the tumor
microenvironment, including endothelial cells, infiltrating
neutrophils, and tumor-associated macrophages, or by
the tumor cells themselves. IL8 binds to the G proteincoupled receptors (GPCR) CXCR1 and CXCR2 [13],
and activates multiple signal transduction cascades that

INTRODUCTION
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the ErbB
family (ErbB1–4) are highly expressed in different breast
cancer subtypes [1] and frequently contribute to breast
cancer progression and metastasis [2]. Overexpression of
ErbB2 (HER2), for example, is associated with a highly
aggressive breast tumors and poor clinical outcome [3].
The ErbB receptors are activated by ligand-induced
homo- or heterodimerization, followed by receptors transphosphorylation and activation of multiple downstream
effectors and signaling cascades. Two classes of ligands
activate the ErbB receptors; the EGF-like ligands and
neuregulins (NRGs). EGF-like ligands induce the formation
of ErbB1 (EGFR) homodimers or ErbB1/2 heterodimers,
whereas NRGs bind directly to ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 and
induce the formation of ErbB3 or ErbB4 homodimers as
well as ErbB2/3 or ErbB2/4 heterodimers [4]. ErbB2 does
not bind any known ligand [5], and ErbB3 has a crippled
kinase domain lacking catalytic activity [6], and thus

can affect cell survival, migration and invasion. Previous
studies have shown that IL8 induces activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 in human neutrophils and
that PYK2 activation is crucial for IL8-induced neutrophil
chemotaxis [14].
PYK2 is activated by multiple cytokines, growth
factors (GFs), hormones and neuropeptides [15–18] and
regulates different signal transduction cascades that control
cell proliferation, migration and invasion [19–21]. PYK2 has
been implicated in the progression and invasion of several
human cancers, including glioblastoma, hepatocytoma, nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma, prostate as well as breast cancer
[22, 23]. Moreover, previous studies showed that PYK2
and its closely related kinase FAK are highly expressed
in ErbB2-positive breast cancers and contribute to the
proliferative and invasive potential of breast cancer cell
lines [24, 25]. We have recently found that PYK2 enhances
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and markedly
facilitates the migration and invasion of triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) cells [26]. Specifically we found
that PYK2 prolongs the signals of EMT-inducers, such as
EGF, by sustaining endosomal-derived receptor signaling
and consequently postponing signal termination, and by
participating in a positive feedback loop that links cell
surface receptor(s) to transcription factor(s) activation. This
positive feedback loop links the EGFR and cMet RTKs to
PYK2 activation, which in turn phosphorylates STAT3 who
directly regulates PYK2 transcription [26]. The involvement
of PYK2 in a positive feedback loop suggests that PYK2
can integrate different signal transduction cascades and
potentiate various cellular responses. Indeed, we have
previously showed that PYK2 functions at a convergence
point between integrin and GPCRs signaling [27]. Here we
show that PYK2 integrates signaling of the ErbB receptors
and the IL8 CXCR1/2 receptors to potentiate breast cancer
cell invasion through a positive feedback loop.

Previous studies have shown that EGF and HRG
enhance the migration of these three breast cancer cell lines
[29, 31, 32], as well as the invasion of MCF7 and SKBR3
cells [32]. To define the role of PYK2 in ErbB receptorsmediated signaling, we first examined whether EGF
and HRG induce phosphorylation of PYK2 at its major
autophosphorylation site Y402 utilizing a phospho-specific
antibody and Western blotting (WB) analysis. As shown in
Figure 1A and in Supplementary Figure 2, both EGF and
HRG induced rapid phosphorylation of PYK2 in the three
breast cancer cell lines. Phospho-PYK2 (pY402) was already
detected at 5 min following ligand stimulation and sustained
for almost 2 hr. Importantly, EGF and HRG also induced
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the three cell lines as assessed
by WB using anti-pERK1/2 antibody. Likewise, HRG
induced AKT phosphorylation (S473) in the three cell lines,
while EGF induced strong and sustained phosphorylation of
AKT in SKBR3 and T47D cells (2 hr) and transient AKT
phosphorylation in MCF7 cells. These results suggest that
both EGF and HRG induce PYK2 phosphorylation and
concomitantly activate the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT
pathways, two signaling pathways that regulate the migration
and/or invasion of these breast cancer cells [29, 32].
We next examined the subcellular distribution of
phospho-PYK2 in serum-starved or EGF/HRG-stimulated
cells using immunofluorescence (IF) and confocal
microscopy analysis. Representative images of control and
ligand-induced cells at 60 min are shown in Figure 1B. As
seen, both EGF and HRG markedly increased the focal
adhesion sites as well as the phosphorylation (pY402)
of PYK2 as determined by immunostaining for paxillin
and PYK2(pY402), respectively. Interestingly, pPYK2
was mainly detected in peripheral focal adhesions and
partially co-localized with paxillin, suggesting that these
two proteins co-localized at subsets of focal adhesions,
and also that they are both involved in cell migration.

RESULTS

PYK2 positively regulates EGF/HRG-induced
breast cancer cell spreading and migration

EGF and HRG induce activation of PYK2 in
different breast cancer cell lines

To examine the effect of PYK2 on EGF- or HRGinduced migration of SKBR3, T47D or MCF7 cells, we
knocked down its expression by shRNA using lentivirus
infection as we previously described [26]. Two PYK2
shRNAs (Supplementary Figure 3) have been used to
downregulate the expression of PYK2 throughout this study,
and representative results with only one shRNA are shown.
Cell migration is a multistep process involving a
series of morphogenetic events and actin cytoskeleton
remodeling [33]. We therefore examined the influence of
PYK2 knockdown on EGF- or HRG-induced cell spreading
and actin cytoskeleton remodeling using IF and confocal
microscopy analysis. As shown in Figure 2, both HRG and
EGF induced rapid (5 min) cells spreading and membrane
ruffling in the control MCF7, T47D and SKBR3 cells. Later
the cells extended lamellipodia together with the formation

We have recently showed that EGF induces rapid
phosphorylation of PYK2 in the TNBC cell line MDAMB-468, and that PYK2 positively regulates EGF-induced
migration and invasion of MDA-MB-468 cells [26]. To
examine the role of PYK2 in ErbB receptors signaling in
other breast cancer subtypes, we employed two estrogen
receptor (ER) positive luminal A breast cancer cell lines,
MCF7 and T47D, and an HER2-overexpressing cell line,
SKBR3. MCF7 cells express low levels of EGFR and
HER2, while T47D express moderate levels of the four ErbB
receptors (EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and
ErbB4/HER4 receptors) [28, 29]. SKBR3 cells overexpress
HER2, highly express EGFR but have relatively low levels
of ErbB3 and ErbB4 [30] (Supplementary Figure 1).

Phosphorylation of PYK2. MCF7, T47D and SKBR3 cells were serum-starved for 24 hr and then stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) or
HRG (10 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods. Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for PYK2 phosphorylation (pY402) as well
as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT (S473) by WB using phospho-specific antibodies. Reproducible results were obtained in three
independent experiments. Quantitative analysis of these results is shown in Supplementary Figure 2. B. Localization of pPYK2 (pY402).

of actin stress fibers (60 min), consistent with previous
reports [29]. However, PYK2-depleted MCF7, T47D, or
SKBR3 cells failed to spread in response to either EGF or
HRG and remained tightly in contact even 60 min following
ligand stimulation. Membrane ruffles and lamellipodia
could hardly be detected in either EGF- or HER-induced
PYK2-depleted cells, suggesting that PYK2 depletion
markedly affects early events of the migratory response in
these three breast cancer cell types.
We next examined whether PYK2 affects the
migration of MCF7, T47D or SKBR3 cells in response
to either EGF or HRG employing the transwell migration
assay. As seen in Figure 3, the migratory response to
either EGF or HRG was most profound in the control
SKBR3 cells. HRG had a stronger effect on the migration
of T47D and MCF7 cells as compared to EGF, consistent
with the low expression levels of EGFR in these cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). Depletion of PYK2 markedly
attenuated the migratory responses to either EGF or to HRG
in the three cell lines. These findings suggest that PYK2 not
only regulates early migratory events, such as cell spreading
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and membrane ruffling, but also has a profound effect on
EGF- and/or HRG-induced breast cancer cell migration.

PYK2 affects EGF- and HRG-mediated
downstream signaling in breast cancer cells
Previously it was shown that multiple signaling
pathways regulate the migration and/or invasion of MCF7
[34], T47D [29], and SKBR3 [32] cells in response to HRG
and EGF. The Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, p38MAPK and the
STAT3 pathways have been implicated in the migratory and
invasive responses of EGF and/or HRG in these cell lines
[29, 35, 36]. To examine the influence of PYK2 on these
signaling pathways, we compared the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, p38MAPK, AKT (S473) and STAT3 (Y705) in
control and PYK2-depleted cells in response to EGF or
HRG using phospho-specific antibodies. As seen in Figure
4 and in Supplementary Figure 4, knockdown of PYK2
markedly reduced (by 70–90%, Supplementary Figure 4)
EGF- or HRG-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in all the
three cell lines. AKT phosphorylation (S473) was slightly

anti-paxillin (green) antibody as a focal adhesion marker. Shown are representative confocal images. Scale bars: 10 μm.

cells in response to EGF (by 40% and 30%, respectively,
Supplementary Figure 4) but not in response to HRG.
STAT3 phosphorylation, which was rapidly induced in
EGF-treated SKBR3 cells, was also inhibited by PYK2
knockdown. STAT3 phosphorylation was weakly detected
in the non-invasive T47D cells or the weakly invasive
MCF7 cells in response to either EGF or HRG treatment,
and PYK2 knockdown had a slight effect on EGF-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation in T47D cells. Phosphorylation
of p38 MAPK pathway was not inhibited by PYK2

knockdown. Collectively, these results suggest that
PYK2 affects different migratory and invasive pathways
in breast cancer cells in response to either EGF or HRG
stimulation, but most profoundly affects the MAPK and
STAT3 pathways.

PYK2 depletion affects cell invasion and MMPs
expression
It was previously shown that both EGF and HRG
enhance the invasion of the highly metastatic SKBR3 cells

effect of PYK2 knockdown on SKBR3 invasion using the

elicited a weaker (~70%) invasive response in SKBR3

bands was determined using NIH ImageJ software. The specificity of AZD6244 and AG490 inhibitors was assessed by WB analysis using
phospho-specific antibodies as indicated.

(~90%) attenuated SKBR3 invasion in response to either
EGF or HRG treatment.
Invasion of cancer cells through basement
membrane, tumor stroma, and blood vessel walls, requires
the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [38]. Previous studies
have shown that EGF and HRG upregulate MMP9
in SKBR3 cells [39] as well as in MCF7 cells [40]. In
contrast, the activity of the closely related MMP2 was
unaffected by either HRG or EGF treatment [41]. By
utilizing zymography assay we found that EGF strongly
enhanced MMP9 activity in SKBR3 cells and only weakly
activated MMP2 (Figure 5B), consistent with previous
reports. We further found a weaker induction of MMP9
in response to HRG in SKBR3 cells (Figure 5B) and in
response to EGF in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure
5). Most importantly, knockdown of PYK2 completely
abolished EGF- or HRG-induced MMP9 activity

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 5B), suggesting that PYK2 attenuates cell invasion
by inhibiting MMP9 activity. To examine whether PYK2
affects the activity of MMP9 or its transcription level, we
first assessed the mRNA level of MMP9 in SKBR3 cells at
different time points following EGF treatment using realtime PCR (qRT-PCR), and found a peak of induction at
8 hr (Supplementary Figure 6A). We then examined the
influence of EGF on MMP9 transcription as well as on
the transcription of additional MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2,
MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-10, MMP-13, MMP14, MMP15)
and of CD44, a cell adhesion glycoprotein implicated
in EMT and cancer metastasis [42]. We observed that
EGF markedly increased the transcription of MMP1,
MMP3, MMP10, MMP9 and CD44 (by ~50–250 fold)
in SKBR3 cells. EGF had most profound effect on
MMP9 transcription (~250 fold), and most importantly,
knockdown of PYK2 almost completely abolished
this inducible effect of EGF on MMP9 transcription

WB analysis and phospho-specific antibodies as indicated. Reproducible results were obtained in three independent experiments.

(Figure 5C), suggesting that PYK2 positively regulates
MMP9 transcription and consequently affects its activity
in EGF/HRG-induced SKBR3 cells.

STAT3 inhibitor AG490 markedly decreased the upregulation
of PYK2 and IL8 transcription in response to EGF,
suggesting that STAT3 controls their mRNA expression.
Likewise, depletion of PYK2 markedly reduced the effect of
EGF (by ~60%) on IL8 transcription, suggesting that PYK2
not only modulates MMP9 transcription in response to EGF
but also positively regulates EGF-induced IL8 transcription.
Furthermore, these observations suggest that EGF induces an
IL8 autocrine signaling that may potentiate EGF-mediated
responses. To explore this possibility, we first examined the
effect of IL8 on different signaling pathways in SKBR3
cells including PYK2 phosphorylation. As shown in Figure
6B, IL8 induced a rapid phosphorylation of PYK2 (pY402)
as well as phosphorylation of AKT (S473), ERK1/2 and
STAT3 (Y705). Importantly, depletion of PYK2 substantially
reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 but had
no effect on AKT phosphorylation. These results suggest that
PYK2 is activated not only by EGF but also by EGF-induced
IL8 secretion.
We next asked whether EGF-induced IL8 secretion
plays a role in EGF-mediated cell invasion. To this end, we
employed the SB225002 inhibitor, a competitive inhibitor
of the IL8 receptor CXCR2, as CXCR2 is highly expressed
SKBR3 cells [46]. This inhibitor has been previously used
to block IL8-mediated signaling pathways [47, 48]. To
demonstrate its potency and specificity, we examined its
influence on IL8-induced PYK2, STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2
phosphorylation, and found that these IL8-downstream
signals were markedly inhibited (Figure 7A). Importantly,
IL8 also induced EGFR phosphorylation, which was
substantially inhibited by SB225002, thus demonstrating the
trans-activation of EGFR by CXCR1/2-mediated signaling,
consistent with previous reports [11, 49].

PYK2 potentiates cell invasion via a positive
feedback loop between EGF and IL8 receptors
Thus far our findings suggest that PYK2 positively
regulates the invasion of SKBR3 cells in response to EGF
and HRG, at least in part, by increasing MMP9 transcription.
Previous studies suggest that MMP9 transcription is
regulated by multiple pathways, including the MAPK [37]
and the STAT3 [43] signaling pathways. The involvement
of STAT3 in EGF-induced MMP9 transcription in SKBR3
is controversial [44]. However, we found that inhibition
of STAT3 by the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490 markedly
reduced (~3-fold) MMP9 activity as determined by
zymography assay (Figure 5D). Yet, the MEK inhibitor
AZD6244 had a more profound effect (Figure 5D),
suggesting that the STAT3 pathway and more profoundly
the MAPK pathway positively regulate MMP9 transcription
in EGF-induced SKBR3 cells. The specificity and potency
of both inhibitors (AG49 and AZD6244) were confirmed by
Western blotting as shown in Figure 5D (lower panel).
STAT3 is a transcription factor that regulates the
expression of multiple targets genes including PYK2 [26]
and the cytokine IL8. Previous studies suggest that IL8 plays
a key role in HER2-mediated cell invasion [45]. We therefore
assessed the effect of EGF on the transcription levels of both
PYK2 and IL8 in SKBR3 cells. We found a remarkable
upregulation of IL8 (~17 fold) transcription and a moderate
increase in the level of PYK2 mRNA (by 4 fold) and protein
(Figure 6A). Inhibition of STAT3 activation by the JAK2/

presence of the CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 (2 μM) for the indicated time periods. Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the
activation of different signaling pathways by WB using the indicated antibodies. Reproducible results were obtained in three independent
experiments. B. Invasion of EGF (50 ng/ml)-stimulated SKBR3 cells through matrigel was assessed by the Boyden chamber assay in the

mean values ± s.d. from three independent experiments. C. The activity and mRNA level of MMP9 in EGF (50 ng/ml)-stimulated SKBR3
cells in the absence or presence of SB225002 (2 μM) was examined by gelatin zymography and by real-time PCR assays, respectively. The
activity and mRNA level were assessed in the conditioned cell medium after 48 hr of incubation in serum-free medium.

Next, we examined the effect SB225002 on EGFinduced invasion of SKBR3 cells using the transwell
invasion assay. As shown in Figure 7B, SB225002 markedly
attenuated the invasion of SKBR3 cells in response to EGF.
Importantly, SB225002 also inhibited EGF-induced MMP9
activation and its transcription upregulation as demonstrated
by zymography assay (Figure 7C, upper panel) and by qRTPCR (Figure 7C, lower panel), respectively. The marked
effect of both PYK2 shRNA (Figure 5) and SB225002 on
EGF-induced SKBR invasion and MMP9 expression, led
us to examine the influence of SB225002 on EGF-induced
phosphorylation of PYK2 as well as the phosphorylation of
STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2. SKBR3 cells were treated with
EGF in the absence or presence of SB225002 for either short
time periods (5–120 min) or for 48 hr, typical time length of
our invasion assay. The phosphorylation of PYK2, STAT3,
AKT and ERK1/2 was assessed by WB using phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Figure 7D (left panel),
SB225002 had no obvious effects on EGF-mediated signals
at early time points (5–120 min), as expected since the
peak of IL8 expression was observed 8 hr following EGF
treatment (Supplementary Figure 6B). However, at 48 hr,
SB225002 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of
PYK2, STAT3 and ERK1/2 in response to EGF treatment,
but had no effect on EGF-induced AKT phosphorylation
(Figure 7D, right panel). These results imply that following
EGF stimulation, PYK2 enhances a STAT3-dependent IL8
expression, thus creating a positive feedback loop between
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ErbB receptors, PYK2, and IL8. We propose that this positive
feedback loop potentiates EGF-induced cell invasion.

DISCUSSION
In this study we show that PYK2 integrates EGFR/
HER2- and IL8-receptor signaling to potentiate cell
invasion in breast cancer cells. Specifically, we found
that PYK2 is activated in response to EGF and HRG
in different breast cancer subtypes (Figure 1) and that
PYK2 depletion leads to substantial inhibition of EGF/
HRG-mediated cell spreading, migration and invasion
(Figures 2, 3 and 5A). Although previous studies suggest
that PYK2 is involved in the migration and invasion of
glioma and breast cancer cells [21, 50, 51], the underlying
mechanisms have not been fully explored. Here we show
that PYK2 exerts its effects on breast cancer migration and
invasion predominantly through the STAT3 and MAPK
signaling pathways (Figure 4). Both pathways have been
implicated in the transcriptional regulation of MMP9
in SKBR3 cells [37, 43]. Indeed, we found the MMP9
activity was markedly reduced by the MEK inhibitor and
to a lesser extent by the Jak2/STAT3 inhibitor (Figure 5D).
MMP9 is an important mediator of tumor invasion
and angiogenesis, and is significantly associated with
high breast cancer metastasis and relapse [52]. Consistent
with this, we found that both EGF and HRG induce a
remarkable upregulation of MMP9 transcription as well
22221

as its activity in the highly metastatic SKBR3 cells, while
exerting a minor effect on MMP9 expression in the poorlyand non-invasive MCF7 and T47D cells (Supplementary
Figure 7). Most importantly, we found that PYK2 depletion
markedly reduced EGF/HRG-induced MMP9 transcription
and its subsequent gelatinase activity in SKBR3 cells, as
determined by zymography assay (Figure 5B), implying that
PYK2 plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis.
Indeed, recent studies have shown that knocking down of
PYK2 inhibits lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in mice
xenograft model [53], and our analysis of human breast
cancer tissues revealed that PYK2 expression correlates
with high tumor grade and lymph node metastasis [26].
Furthermore, we found that PYK2 enhances EMT of breast
cancer cells, a process that is associated with enhanced cell
motility, invasiveness and metastatic propensity [26].
Various MMPs, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines
and angiogenic factors, such as IL6, IL8, CXCL1,
RANTES, and VEGF are secreted from tumor cells during
EMT [54]. These secreted factors play important role
in EMT maintenance and metastatic response. IL8, for
example, is secreted in response to EMT inducers such as
TGFβ or SNAIL overexpression and is involved in EMT
maintenance through a positive autocrine loop [55]. We
found that both EGF and HRG induce upregulation of IL8
transcription in SKBR3 cells but not in MCF7 or T47D cells
(Supplementary Figure 7). Strikingly, we also found that
IL8 is involved in a positive autocrine loop in SKBR3 cells.
Stimulation of SKBR3 cells with IL8 induced the
phosphorylation of PYK2 and activation of the STAT3,
AKT and ERK1/2 pathways (Figure 6B). Similar albeit
weaker effects were obtained when the low EGFR/HER2
expressing MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with IL8
(Supplementary Figure 8). Most importantly, stimulation of
SKBR3 cells with EGF enhanced the transcription of IL8,
mainly through activation of STAT3 (Figure 6A). PYK2
depletion inhibits EGF-induced IL8 transcription in SKBR3
cells concomitant with inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation
(Figures 4, 6A). These results suggest that PYK2-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation is crucial for IL8 secretion, while
IL8 is crucial for EGF-induced MMP9 transcription (Figure
7C) and for SKBR3 invasion (Figure 7B). In addition,
EGF-induced IL8 secretion markedly affected the longterm activation of PYK2, STAT3 and ERK1/2 (Figure
7D), suggesting that IL8 prolongs or reinforces EGF/
HRG-mediated signals and thus their cellular response.
Collectively, these observations suggest a positive feedback
loop that involves IL8, PYK2 and ErbB receptors (Figure
8). The model shown in Figure 8 demonstrates the role of
PYK2, a common downstream effector of EGFR and IL8
receptors signaling, and its influence on both MMP9 and
IL8 transcription. This model is consistent with the transactivation of ErbB receptors by IL8 (Figure 7A) [11, 49],
and with the high correlation between IL8 production in
breast carcinoma and their metastatic potential (Figure 6A,
Supplementary Figure 7) [12].

Our finding that PYK2 acts at the crossroads of
ErbB- and IL8-receptor signaling pathways (Figure 8)
to potentiate breast cancer invasion suggests that it could
be an effective therapeutic target for invasive and/or
metastatic breast carcinoma. Targeting of ErbB receptors
is commonly used in clinic to treat breast cancer
patients, in particular those with HER2 overexpression
or amplification [56]. However, targeting a single
receptor using monotherapy (inhibitory antibody or
small molecule inhibitors) is usually not effective due to
compensatory pathways and/or acquisition of resistance
mechanisms. Hence, combination therapies using
two or more drugs are commonly used. For example,
combination of HER2 inhibitors with chemotherapy is
often used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer patients
[57]. Previous studies suggest that combination of antiEGFR and anti-IL8 inhibitors markedly enhanced the
anti-metastatic effect of breast cancer cells as compared
to anti-EGFR alone [58], thus suggesting that combining
anti-IL8 and anti-EGFR inhibitors could be an effective
treatment for metastatic breast carcinoma. In light of our
findings, we propose that inhibition of PYK2, a common
downstream effector of both IL8 and ErbB receptors,
could potentiate the impact of ErbB and/or IL8 receptor
inhibitors and attenuate breast cancer invasion and
metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
MCF7, T47D and SKBR3 cells were grown in RPMI
(Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum and a penicillin-streptomycin
mixture (0.1 mg/ml; Beit Haemek, Israel).

Antibodies and reagents
Heregulin (HRG) was purchased from PeproTech
(Israel). EGF, SB225002, Hoechst 33342, TRITC-phalloidin

Figure 8: PYK2 links ErbB and IL8 receptors signaling to potentiate cell invasion. A scheme depicting the positive feedback

loop between ErbB receptors, PYK2 and IL8. EGF/HRG binding to ErbB receptors activates PYK2 (pY402), which in turn, enhances
STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STAT3 enhances IL8 transcription and together with phospho-ERK1/2 potentiates
MMP9 transcription. Increased levels of MMP9 facilitate cell invasion, and autocrine signaling of IL8 via its CXCR1/2 receptor prolongs
ErbB-mediated signaling thereby potentiating the invasive response.

DNA constructs and lentivirus production and
infection

then 1 hr incubation with the secondary antibody. After
washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 5 min
with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and mounted on microscopic
slides using mounting media (10 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 8.0, 16.6% w/v Mowiol4–88 and 33% glycerol).
The specimens were analyzed by using a confocal
laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).

Two different shRNA sequences were used to
downregulate PYK2 expression. The first one (No.1) was
purchased from Sigma (TRCN00000231519), whereas
the second one (No. 2) was described previously [50].
Lentivirus production and infection were conducted
essentially as previously described [59]. The PYK2 shRNAs
were cloned into the pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vector. Infected
MCF7, SKBR3 or T47D cells were grown in selection
medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin for 72 hr.

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and real-time PCR
analysis
RNA was purified using Tri Reagent (Sigma). cDNA
was generated using oligo(dT) primer and M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real-time
PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green I as a
fluorescent dye, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines
using the ABI StepOnePlus 7500 Real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems; Invitrogen). All experiments were
carried out in triplicates and normalized to GAPDH RNA
levels. Real-time PCR primers were designed using the
Primerexpress software of Applied Biosystems (Invitrogen).

Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells were grown on coverslips, washed with PBS
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for
15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then
incubated for 15 min in PBS containing 0.1 M glycine,
incubated in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton
X-100, 10% goat serum and 2% BSA in TBS for 30 min,
followed by 1 hr incubation with the primary antibody, and

Cells (105 cells/insert) were plated in the upper
compartment of a Transwell tray (BD Bioscience, San
Jose, California). The lower compartment was coated with
25 ug/ml collagen for 2 h prior to cell plating. Cells were
allowed to migrate through the intervening nitrocellulose
membrane for 20 hr in the presence of growth factor in
the lower chamber. Thereafter, cells were fixed in 3%
PFA in PBS, permeabilized in Triton X-100 (0.05%) and
stained with Methyl Violet (0.02%). Non-migrating cells,
growing on the upper side of the filter, were removed with
a cotton swab and cells that had migrated photographed.
For cell invasion assays, 105 cells/insert were plated in the
