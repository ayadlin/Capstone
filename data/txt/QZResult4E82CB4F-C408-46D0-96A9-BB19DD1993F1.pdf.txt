ABSTRACT
Background: Erlotinib and gefitinib are weak base drugs whose absorption and
clinical efficacy may be impaired by concomitant gastric acid suppressive (AS) therapy,
yet proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2As) are
widely indicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for the prevention and
treatment of erlotinib-induced gastrointestinal injury and corticosteroid-associated
gastric irritation. We assessed the clinical relevance of this potential drug-drug
interaction (DDI) in a retrospective cohort of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.
Results: The AS usage rate was 35%. In the overall cohort, AS users did not
experience poorer OS (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.92 – 2.35, P = 0.10; median, 11.4 versus
17.5 months) or PFS (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.89 – 2.12, P = 0.16; median, 7.6 versus 8.7
months) compared with non-users in multivariate Cox regression analysis. However,
subgroup analyses indicated that AS usage was associated with significantly poorer
OS and PFS in patients who had fewer or milder comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity
index ≤ 2), those with Karnofsky performance status < 90, and never-smokers.
Materials and Methods: A retrospective database analysis of 157 patients given
erlotinib or gefitinib for EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC from two institutions was
conducted. Patients were classified as AS-users if the periods of AS and anti-EGFR
therapy overlapped by ≥ 30%. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) were assessed according to AS usage.
Conclusions: Concomitant AS therapy did not have an adverse impact on OS and/
or PFS in the overall cohort. Our subgroup findings should be regarded exploratory
and require replication in a large prospective cohort.

over standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in
large phase III randomized trials, yielding response rates
of 62% – 83% and median progression-free survival
duration of 9.2 – 13.1 months [2-6]. The main side-effects
include rash, diarrhoea, anorexia and fatigue [7], which
are generally well-tolerated and associated with lower
rates of treatment-related drug discontinuation or dose
modifications compared to platinum-containing regimens
[4].
However, a more severe complication is the risk of
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation among erlotinib-treated
patients, which has led to fatalities [8] and the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) revising the prescribing
information in 2010 [9]. The pathophysiology of acute GI
events may be related to higher levels of EGFR expression
in the epithelium of the GI tract [10]. In a small postmarketing study of 103 erlotinib-treated NSCLC patients,
the incidence of GI injury was 4.9% [11]. Permanent
drug discontinuation is advised if it occurs, and the risk
is higher in patients receiving concomitant non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, anti-angiogenic
agents, taxane-based chemotherapy, and who have prior
history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease [9,
11]. Prophylactic acid suppression (AS) therapy, such
as histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2A) and proton
pump inhibitors (PPI), may be given to patients receiving
erlotinib [12]. AS are also widely used among the general
population as over-the-counter medications to counter
symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and market
research also indicates that the prevalence of concurrent
AS prescription is 33.2% – 46.3% among lung cancer
patients in the United States [13].
AS therapy suppresses acid secretion by parietal
cells and cause the intragastric pH to be raised from ~1.2
to ~4. PPIs have a longer lasting effect (~24 h) compared
to H2As (~12 h) [14]. Over half of recently approved
molecular targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including
erlotinib and gefitinib, exhibit weakly basic chemical
properties and pH-dependent solubility [13, 15, 16]. The
acid dissociation constants (pKa1) of erlotinib and gefitinib
are both ~5.4 [13]. Thus, under hypochlorhydic conditions
induced by AS, the equilibrium shifts from the ionized to
the non-ionized form which is less readily absorbed. This
pH-dependent drug-drug interaction (DDI) may diminish
drug exposure and consequently, the clinical efficacy
of erlotinib and gefitinib. Due to the extended period of
gastric acid suppression, staggered dosing is unlikely to
eliminate potential drug interactions, although it may
be theoretically possible to minimise the interaction
by prescribing H2As at night instead of the twice-daily
regimens approximately 12 hours apart from the TKI.
The potential for an antagonistic drug interaction
is reflected in the FDA boxed warnings to prescribing
information for erlotinib and gefitinib [9, 17]. According
to the package inserts, concomitant omeprazole 40 mg
daily decreased erlotinib area under the concentration-time
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
by 46% and 61% respectively in healthy volunteers, while
ranitidine 300 mg daily reduced erlotinib AUC and Cmax
by 33% and 54% [9]. High-dose ranitidine to maintain
intragastric pH > 5.0 resulted in 44% and 70% reduction
of gefitinib AUC and Cmax respectively [17]. However,
other studies demonstrate that concomitant use of AS do
not appear to have an antagonistic interaction with TKI
pharmacokinetics [18-21]. Of higher evidential value are
a retrospective analysis of the BR.21 trial database and
a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD)
study in Japanese NSCLC patients which did not find
significant differences in erlotinib plasma concentrations
and exposure respectively between AS users and non-users
[19, 20].
Two retrospective analyses, including the BR.21
database review, have attempted to address whether AS
therapy may compromise the clinical efficacy of erlotinib
and gefitinib in advanced NSCLC patients [20, 22]. Of
note, in both these studies patients were unselected for
activating EGFR mutations. Hilton et al. reported a lack
of significant differences in progression free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) in AS users and nonusers [20], whereas Chu et al. reported poorer median
PFS (1.4 vs 2.3 months, P < 0.001) and OS (12.9 vs
16.8 months, P = 0.003) in AS users vs non-users [22]. A
potential source of study heterogeneity is the underlying
difference in proportions of EGFR wild-type and mutant
patients in each cohort, whereby the number of EGFRmutant patients was unknown in the former study while
only 4/124 patients in the latter study harboured EGFR
mutations.
Since the EGFR mutational status may confound
attempts to address whether AS therapy adversely impacts
PFS and OS in erlotinib or gefitinib-treated NSCLC
patients, we performed a retrospective study examining
a consecutive series of patients who tested positive for
known activating EGFR mutations, who received EGFR
TKIs with or without concomitant AS therapy.

RESULTS
One hundred and ninety-one patients given
erlotinib or gefitinib for EGFR-mutant non-small cell
lung cancer were identified. Thirty-four patients were
excluded from analyses as we were unable to determine
the prescription dates when they initiated treatment with
gefitinib or erlotinib. Hence, 157 patients were evaluable
for overall and progression-free survival, of which, 55
patients had clinically significant concomitant PPI or H2A
prescriptions (AS users; ≥ 30% overlap with the duration
of anti-EGFR therapy). Baseline clinical characteristics
and demographics were generally well-balanced with
the exception of the presence of brain metastases and
Karnofsky performance status (Table 1).

At the cutoff date for overall survival (OS) of June
15, 2016, which entails a median follow-up of 50.0 months
and 48.2 months among AS users and non-users, 51 and
91 deaths respectively had occurred. Figure 1A shows
the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for AS users and nonusers. The median OS was 11.4 months among AS users
compared to 17.5 months among non-users (unadjusted
univariate HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.91 – 1.83, P = 0.15).
Adjustment for baseline imbalances and all potentially
prognostic clinical characteristics (which included
patient age, presence of brain metastases, presence of
liver metastases, smoking history, race, sex, Karnofsky
performance status and Charlson comorbidity index)
resulted in a more pronounced impact of AS therapy, with
a HR of 1.47 (95% CI: 0.92 – 2.35), but without reaching
statistical significance (P = 0.10; Table 2, multiple Cox
regression model). The heterogeneity of the treatment

baseline disease characteristics (Figure 1B). In most
subgroups, HRs were consistent with that of the overall
cohort; however, the hazard ratio for death was increased
in females, symptomatic patients (KPS < 90), those with
milder or fewer co-morbidities (CCI ≤ 2), and neversmokers who received AS therapy compared to those who
did not.
In this cohort, the median progression-free survival
(PFS) among AS users and non-users are 7.6 months
and 8.7 months (Figure 2A; unadjusted univariate HR =
1.19, 95% CI: 0.85 – 1.65, P = 0.16). No observations
were censored as all patients experienced either disease
progression or death. Multivariate Cox regression
accounting for baseline differences and prognostic factors
yielded a modest increase in the impact of AS therapy
(HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.89 – 2.12, P = 0.16). In subgroup
analysis (Figure 2B), the effect of AS therapy on disease
control varied depending on the presence of comorbidities,

therapy and erlotinib or gefitinib specifically in EGFRmutant non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Several reasons may account for the lack of
antagonistic drug interaction in the overall cohort. Firstly,
activating mutations in EGFR confer exquisite sensitivity
to EGFR TKIs in non-small cell lung cancer, with cell
lines harbouring these mutations being 10 to 50-fold more
sensitive to gefitinib [24, 25]. Hence, despite reduced
bioavailability, plasma levels of erlotinib and gefitinib may
remain sufficient to achieve effective EGFR inhibition.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the steady state
trough concentrations of erlotinib or gefitinib are reduced
below the target concentration by AS use [20]. Secondly,
the approved dosages of erlotinib and gefitinib are slightly
above the biologically optimal dosage. For instance,
although the approved dosage for gefitinib is 250 mg/
day, early phase I and clinical pharmacodynamic studies
actually indicated that the clinical and biological activity
are only dose-dependent up to 150 mg/day, beyond which
there are limited additional clinical benefits to reap [26,
27]. Similarly, a small retrospective study of 7 EGFRmutant patients who were treated with erlotinib at the
lowest available tablet size of 25 mg daily demonstrated
a response rate of 71.5% and median PFS of 17 months
(95% CI: 6-35 months), which is comparable with the
approved dosage of 150 mg/day [28, 29].
Overall survival may be affected by many important
parameters. In this study, significantly more AS users had
brain metastases at baseline compared to non-users (Table
1). Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are frequently
given to control cerebral vasogenic edema and reduce
neurologic symptoms secondary to brain metastases,
which are common in advanced NSCLC, but in turn may
necessitate AS therapy to reduce gastric irritation [30].

with patients having mild to moderate comorbidities (CCI
≤ 2) more likely to benefit from avoiding AS therapy, and
patients at higher risk of mortality from other diseases
(CCI = 3) less likely to be adversely affected by AS
therapy. As in the case with overall survival, the hazard
ratio for progression or death was increased among neversmokers, symptomatic from cancer (KPS < 90) or had
fewer or milder co-morbidities (CCI ≤ 2) who received
AS therapy compared to those who did not.

DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that AS
therapy, on whole, does not compromise the clinical
efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib: no appreciable
differences in overall (HR of 1.47, 95% CI: 0.92 – 2.35, P
= 0.10; Figure 1A, Table 2) and progression-free survival
(HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.89 – 2.12, P = 0.16; Figure 2A,
Table 2) were detected between AS users and non-AS
users, corroborating the findings of Zenke and colleagues,
who have conducted the only other retrospective study
in a molecularly-selected, EGFRi-sensitive cohort [23].
However, our retrospective data further identifies patient
subgroups defined by smoking history, performance
status, sex and presence of comorbidities who may be
more susceptible to clinically relevant antagonistic drug
interactions (Figures 1B, 2B).
H2A and PPI medications are widely consumed by
the general population and cancer patients for symptomatic
relieve of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and are further
commonly indicated during the course of erlotinib
treatment to prevent GI injury [12, 13]. To our knowledge,
this is the largest study to examine the potential
pharmacological interaction between concomitant AS

This underscores another factor accounting for the high
prevalence of AS usage among cancer patients. However,
in multivariate Cox analyses, the presence of brain
metastasis was not found to independently impact overall
and progression-free survival.
As with retrospective reviews, there are several
limitations to consider. First, there were several clinical
variables that we could not measure. We were unable to
ascertain information on the frequency and severity of
adverse events, which were not consistently recorded.
Secondly, we were also reluctant to report response rates as
long intervals between radiographic assessments hampered
accurate assessment of the treatment responses. This
recapitulates a common limitation of many retrospective
analyses, whereby imaging assessments are less frequent
and regular, and may not be standardised in terms of
frequency, interval and follow-up protocol compared
to prospective studies. Finally, we also acknowledge
confounders such as patient compliance, dietary factors
and over-the-counter usage of gastric acid suppressants,
which could otherwise be controlled in a prospective trial.
As such, our results should be regarded as exploratory and
require replication in a large prospective cohort.
In summary, we have performed a comprehensive
literature survey and retrospective evaluation of the DDI
between erlotinib/gefitinib and H2A/PPI therapies. Based
on the published literature as well as our own data, we
conclude that whilst AS therapy is likely to modify the
bioavailability of EGFR TKIs, there is limited evidence
that the pharmacokinetic interaction adversely impacts the
PFS and OS outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.
Large prospective studies are warranted to confirm our
findings, and meta-analyses should be performed when
additional retrospective data become available. It is just as
important to seek out potential pharmacological strategies
to eliminate this pharmacokinetic interaction. For instance,
van Leeuwen and colleagues recently reported that simply
ingesting the acidic beverage Cola with erlotinib improves
its bioavailability in patients who are also receiving
esomeprazole [31]. Moreover, this study highlights the
importance of dietary factors – which are hard to control
– in influencing the absorption of oncological TKIs. We
further caution that our results should not be extrapolated
to other small-molecule oncological therapeutics such as
crizotinib and sorafenib, many of which have weakly basic
properties [13].

available. Data was abstracted for the following clinical
variables: treatment prescription dates, age, gender, race,
smoking status, type of EGFR mutation, Charlson comorbidity, Karnorfsky performance status, metastatic sites,
date of diagnosis, last follow-up and, if deceased, cause
of death. Clinically significant concomitant prescription
of PPI or H2A (all generations) was defined as ≥ 30%
overlap with the duration of anti-EGFR therapy. Approval
was obtained from the local institutional review boards to
perform this retrospective medical record review.

Statistical analyses
Baseline differences in clinical characteristics and
demographics were evaluated using Fisher’s exact test or
χ2 test for proportions, and unpaired t-tests for continuous
variables. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
date of initial treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib until
death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
time from treatment initiation until disease progression,
clinical deterioration, or death. Patients without these
events were censored on their last follow-up visit. PFS
and OS were analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method,
and treatment comparisons were by the log-rank test.
The median follow-up duration of overall survival was
estimated using the reverse Kaplan Meier [32]. Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to adjust the
treatment effect of AS therapy for other clinical variables,
which included patient age, presence of brain metastases,
presence of liver metastases, smoking history, race, sex,
Karnofsky performance status and Charlson comorbidity
index. The proportional hazards assumption was tested
and confirmed for each of these variables using the method
of Grambsch and Therneau [33]. P values of less than 0.05
(two-sided) were considered to indicate nominal statistical
significance. STATA (version 13, StataCorp) was used for
analyses.
