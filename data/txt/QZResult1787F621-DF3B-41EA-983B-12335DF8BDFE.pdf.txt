Abstract
Ample evidence supports that prostate tumor metastasis originates from a
rare population of cancer cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Unfortunately,
little is known about the identity of these cells, making it difficult to target the
metastatic prostate tumor. Here, for the first time, we report the identification of a
rare population of prostate cancer cells that express the Tie-2 protein. We found that
this Tie-2High population exists mainly in prostate cancer cell lines that are capable of
metastasizing to the bone. These cells not only express a higher level of CSC markers
but also demonstrate enhanced resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug Cabazitaxel.
In addition, knockdown of the expression of the Tie-2 ligand angiopoietin (Ang1) led to suppression of CSC markers, suggesting that the Ang-1/Tie-2 signaling
pathway functions as an autocrine loop for the maintenance of prostate CSCs. More
importantly, we found that Tie-2High prostate cancer cells are more adhesive than the
Tie-2Low population to both osteoblasts and endothelial cells. Moreover, only the Tie2High, but not the Tie-2Low cells developed tumor metastasis in vivo when injected at a
low number. Taken together, our data suggest that Tie-2 may play an important role
during the development of prostate tumor metastasis.

Introduction

initiating cells (TICs)/cancer stem cells (CSCs) may
play key roles in the initiation, progression and treatment
failure of the disease [5-7]; however, their exact identity
remains unclear. These cells share many similarities with
normal stem cells, including the ability to differentiate
into cells of different lineages and the dependence on a
stem cell niche for the maintenance of their stemness.
Interestingly, according to previous studies, CSCs are
capable of creating their own CSC niche by recruiting
mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow [8].
CSCs can also ‘hijack’ the established normal stem cell
niches [9]; as has been demonstrated in both human and
mouse models of prostate and breast cancers. According
to Shiozawa et al. [10], prostate CSCs are capable of
competing with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for

Prostate cancer is one of the most common
solid tumors in men and is the second leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in men worldwide [1, 2]. Patients
with advanced prostate cancer are normally treated with
hormone ablation therapy. This therapy is effective
initially, as prostate cancer cells require androgen to grow
and survive; however, the cancer cells eventually become
androgen-independent and develop metastatic, castrationresistant tumors [3]. At this stage, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy have only minor benefits. As a result,
advanced prostate cancer remains incurable with current
treatment strategies [4].
Recent studies suggested that prostate tumorwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the bone marrow niche. Moreover, prostate cancer cells
that occupy the niche were found to express the CXCR4
receptor, which is responsible for mediating the interaction
between HSCs and the niche. By blocking the CXCL12/
CXCR4 pathway, prostate cancer bone metastasis was
significantly suppressed, supporting the hypothesis that
prostate tumors metastasize to the bone by adopting this
bone-homing signaling pathway. However, although
disseminated prostate cancer cells can be detected in the
bone marrow of prostate cancer patients, bone metastasis
may take years to develop. This may reflect the time
required for the disseminated cancer cells to establish
a suitable tumor microenvironment before the cells can
grow exponentially. Therefore, a better understanding of
the bone marrow stem cell niche and its role in supporting
bone metastasis may aid the development of effective
treatments.
Tie-2 is a membrane receptor commonly expressed
by HSCs, osteoblasts and endothelial cells. It binds to and
is activated by angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a cytokine actively
secreted by osteoblasts within the bone marrow niche [1113]. Similar to the KITLG/c-Kit, CXCL12/CXCR4 and
FGF1/FGFR chemokine axes, the Ang-1/Tie-2 signalling
pathway also plays a key role in regulating the homing and
stemness of HSCs [14-18]. According to Arai et al. [15],
Tie-2 receptors are expressed by the quiescent HSCs that
adhere to osteoblasts within the inner surface of the bone.
The same group further demonstrated that osteoblasts
secrete a large amount of Ang-1, which promotes the
adhesion of HSCs to osteoblasts while maintaining
the cells in a quiescent state. Recently, the Ang-1/Tie-2
signalling pathway was also found to promote muscle
satellite cell self-renewal [19]. Apart from regulating
normal stem cells, Tie-2 was also found to play a role in
cancer progression. As reported by Lee et al. [20], Tie-2
was found to be expressed by neoplastic glial cells, and its
expression level was significantly associated with disease
progression. Tie-2 activation was also found to correlate
with chemoresistance [21]. Further research by the same
group demonstrated that Tie-2 promoted glioma cell
invasion and modulated the interaction of glioma tumor
stem cells with endothelial cells [22].
In this study, we show that Tie-2 is expressed
by a rare population of prostate cancer cells that coexpress several CSC markers. Compared to the Tie-2Low
population, Tie-2High prostate cancer cells demonstrate
not only enhanced chemoresistance but also an increased
ability to adhere to stromal cells such as endothelial cells
and osteoblasts. Intra-cardiac injection of the cells into
immune-incompetent mice confirmed that Tie-2High cells,
but not Tie-2Low cells, actively developed into metastatic
tumors in vivo. Our data, therefore, have demonstrated a
novel role for Tie-2 in the development of prostate tumor
metastasis.

Identification of a rare population of Tie-2High
prostate cancer cells
Although Ang-1/Tie-2 is one of the key signalling
pathways involved in HSC maintenance, it is currently
unknown whether it plays any role in prostate cancer
progression. To address this question, we first examined
whether prostate cancer cells express Tie-2. Using a
PE-conjugated anti Tie-2 antibody, the expression level
of the Tie-2 receptor in a panel of prostate cancer cell
lines with different metastatic potential (LAPC4, 22Rv1,
DU145, LNCaP, C42B, MDA-PCa-2b and PC-3) was
determined by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1A and
1B, Tie-2 positive cells exist at a very low level in soft
tissue metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (between 0.1 0.15%). However, the Tie-2 positive population was found
higher in C42B (a bone metastatic cell line derived from
LNCaP) (0.35%), and two bone metastatic prostate cancer
cell lines (0.33% and 0.39% in PC-3 and MDA-PCa-2b
respectively). Consistently, qRT-PCR analysis revealed
that Tie-2 mRNA was expressed at a higher level in the
highly metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 1C).
More importantly, Tie-2 was also found to be expressed
not only in PC-3 tumors metastasized into a humanized
bone scaffold (left panel) established in our previous study
[23], but also in bone metastatic tumor of human prostate
cancer patient (right panel), further suggesting that Tie-2
may play roles in the development of prostate tumor bone
metastasis (Figure 1D).

Co-expression of stem cell markers with Tie-2 in
prostate cancer cells
To further characterize the Tie-2 positive prostate
cancer cells, we first performed FACS to enrich the
Tie-2-positive population from PC-3 cells. Analysis of
the population sorted by flow cytometry confirmed the
successful enrichment of Tie-2High cells (Figure 2A) by cell
sorting. cDNA microarray analysis was then performed
to examine the gene expression profile of Tie-2High cells.
As shown in in Suppl Table 2, several stem cell factors/
markers commonly found in HSCs (e.g. FGF1, KITLG
and CXCR4) were found to be upregulated in the Tie-2High
population, which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR
analysis (Figure 2B), demonstrating that Tie-2 expression
is associated with upregulation of HSC markers.

cells

population with Cabazitaxel led to induction of apoptosis
of 48% cells, as evidenced by Annexin V staining.
However, the apoptotic population was significantly
lower in Tie-2High cells under the same conditions (<35%),
clearly demonstrating that Tie-2 expression is associated
with Cabazitaxel resistance.

One of the key roles of Tie-2 is to regulate the
quiescence state of HSCs. To determine if expression of
Tie-2 is associated with cellular quiescent, HO/PY staining
was performed to quantitate quiescent population in both
Tie-2High and Tie-2Low prostate cancer cells. As expected,
the population of quiescent cells was increased more
than 3-fold in the Tie-2High population when compared to
the Tie-2Low population (Figure 2C), suggesting that Tie2 expression plays an important role in maintaining the
quiescent state of prostate cancer cells. Cellular quiescence
has been shown to contribute to the chemodrug resistance
of CSCs. We therefore examined the sensitivity Tie-2High
prostate cancer cells to Cabazitaxel, a chemotherapeutic
drug commonly used for the treatment of prostate
cancer. As shown in Figure 2D, treatment of the Tie-2Low

Ang-1 activates the Tie-2 downstream signalling
pathway in prostate cancer cells
Because the Ang-1/Tie-2 signalling cascade plays
a role in the regulation of HSC stemness, we therefore
questioned whether Ang-1 also regulates the stemness
of prostate cancer cells. We first treated PC-3 cells with
increasing doses of recombinant Ang-1 (0, 200 and 600
ng/ml) for 72 hours under serum-free conditions. The
expression of a series of stem cell factors/markers known
to be induced by the Ang-1/Tie-2 signalling in HSCs was

sections were stained with antibody against Tie-2. Note that, all the sections were positive for the Tie-2 proteins and the arrows showed the
positive staining within the tumor cells (40X magnifications).

then examined by Western blotting. As shown in Figure
3A (left panel), Ang-1 induced a dose-dependent increase
in AKT phosphorylation, a direct downstream target
of the Ang-1/Tie-2 signalling pathway, confirming that
Tie-2 activates prostate cancer cells. More importantly,
Ang-1 treatment was found to induce the expression of
prostate CSC (CD49f and Bmi-1) and quiescence (p27)
markers in PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. When
the cells were treated with a Tie-2 kinase inhibitor (0, 1
and 5 µM), a cell permeabile pyridinylimidazole found
to block the kinase activity of Tie-2 [24], all the markers
tested were found to be downregulated, suggesting that
activation of Tie-2 is required for maintaining the levels
of these markers (Figure 3A, right panel). To confirm
our findings, cells were transfected with two different
siRNAs that target different regions of the Tie-2 mRNA,
which resulted in a significant decrease (>50%) in the
Tie-2 mRNA level (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3C,
knockdown of Tie-2 led to concomitant decrease in the
level of CD49f, Bmi-1 as well as p27. More interestingly,

the effect of recombinant Ang-1 was significantly
suppressed when the cells were pre-treated with the Tie2 inhibitor (Figure 3D, left panel) or Tie-2 Fc Chimera
(Tie-2 neutralizing peptide) (Figure 3D, right panel).
Furthermore, ectopic expression of Tie-2 in DU145 cells,
which lack endogenous Tie-2 expression (Suppl Figure
1A) and fail to respond to Ang-1 (data not shown), was
found to successfully restore the response of the cells to
Ang-1 treatment (Suppl Figure 1B), further supporting the
hypothesis that activation of Tie-2 by Ang-1 is crucial for
maintaining the expression of stem cell markers in prostate
cancer cells.
Since Ang-1 regulates the stemness of HSCs
through induction of cellular quiescence, we therefore
examined if Ang-1 treatment also induces quiescent of
the prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells were first treated with
Ang-1 before being stained with HO/PY for quantitation
of quiescent population. As shown in Figure 3E &3F,
when cells were treated with recombinant Ang-1, a
4-fold increase in the quiescent population was observed.

Consistently, expression of p27, a protein closely
associated with cell cycle arrest and cellular quiescence,
was also found to be induced by Ang-1 treatment in PC-3
cells (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, inactivation of Tie-2 using
siRNA (Figure 3C), a Tie-2-specific inhibitor or a Tie-2 Fc
chimera (Figure 3D) also led to suppression of p27, even
in the presence of recombinant Ang-1, further suggesting
that Ang-1 induces quiescence of prostate cancer cells
through the activation of Tie-2.

hypothesis, we first confirmed the expression of Ang-1
mRNA in the prostate cancer cell lines with qRT-PCR.
Consistent with previous studies, Ang-1 mRNA was
detectable in prostate cancer cell lines, and its expression
is found higher in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines
(Figure 4A). Nevertheless, transfection of PC-3 cells with
two different Ang-1 siRNAs led to >80% suppression
of the Ang-1 mRNA level, as shown in Figure 4B.
More importantly, knockdown of endogenous Ang-1
resulted in suppression of both CSC (CD49f an Bmi1) and quiescence (p27) markers in PC-3, supporting
the hypothesis that Ang-1 produced by cancer cells is
crucial for CSC maintenance (Figure 4C). Surprisingly,
examination of Ang-1 secretion with ELISA revealed that
C42B produced the highest level of Ang-1 among all the
prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 4D). Meanwhile, we

Because prostate cancer cells are known to secrete

as an autocrine factor in prostate cancer cells. To test this

Ang-1 recombinant proteins (data not shown); however,
knockdown of endogenous Ang-1 not only suppressed
the expression of CD49f an Bmi-1, but also restored
the response of the cells to exogenous Ang-1 treatment,
as evidenced by the induction of CSC and quiescence
markers by recombinant Ang-1 (Figure 4E-4G). These
findings further confirm that Ang-1 regulates the stemness

to speculate that Tie-2 may also regulate the adhesion
of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts. The ability of
the Tie-2High population to adhere to osteoblasts was
then determined with a cell adhesion assay using the
osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63). Examination of the cells
that adhered to a confluent monolayer of MG-63 cells
revealed a significant increase in the adhesion ability of
the Tie-2High population to osteoblasts when compared
to the Tie-2Low cells (Figure 5A). This adhesion ability
was completely abolished in the presence of the Tie-2
inhibitor, although the same treatment failed to affect the
adhesion ability of the Tie-2Lowpopulation (Figure 5B).
A similar result was observed in another osteosarcoma
cell line (SaOS-2) (Suppl Figure 2A & 2B). Strikingly,
we found that the Tie-2High population also showed an
increased ability to adhere to endothelial cells (Figure
5D), which again could be abolished by the addition of
the Tie-2 inhibitor (Figure 5E). To determine whether this

is to facilitate the adhesion of HSCs to osteoblasts, which
is a process that is also required by prostate cancer cells

Tie-2 enriched cells are highly metastatic in vivo

effect of Tie-2 is specific to PC-3 cells, we repeated the
cell adhesion assay with DU-Tie-2-GFP. Similar to Tie2High PC-3 cells, DU-Tie-2-GFP cells also demonstrated
increased adhesion to both MG-63 and HUVECs when
compared to the control cells (DU-GFP), as shown in
Figure 5C & 5F. Meanwhile, the adhesion ability of DUTie-2-GFP cells to MG-63 and HUVECs was also able
to abolish by the addition of Tie-2 inhibitor as shown
in Suppl Figure 2C & 2D. Recently, Ang-1 has been
shown to promote the bridging of intercellular Tie-2
[25]. Considering that osteoblasts express high levels of
Tie-2, it is possible that the cell adhesive ability of the
Tie-2 positive prostate cancer cells is mediated through
bridging of the intercellular Tie-2. Nevertheless, these
findings provide strong evidence that Tie-2 promotes the
adhesion of prostate cancer cells to both endothelial cells
and osteoblasts.

Because we found that higher levels of Tie-2 were
expressed in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, and
conferred the preferential ability to induce a stem cell-like
phenotype and cell adhesion ability of the cancer cells,
we hypothesized that Tie-2 may play an important role
in prostate tumor metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we
examined the ability of Tie-2High prostate cancer cells to
form metastatic tumors in vivo. Three thousand Tie-2High
and Tie-2Low cells isolated from the PC-3-Luc cell line were
injected into the mice via intra-cardiac injection as shown
in Figure 6A. Subsequent development of metastatic
tumors was then determined by bioluminescence (Figure
6B) and ex vivo (Figure 6C and Suppl Figure 3) imaging.
While mice injected with the Tie-2Low cells failed to
develop any tumors, metastatic tumors were found in
3 out of the 8 mice that were injected with the Tie-2High
population. Of the 3 mice that developed tumors, two
exhibited bone metastasis and one exhibited soft tissue

data strongly support that Tie-2High prostate cancer cells are

of cells were injected. These cells may thus represent
the prostate CSC-like population, which contributes to
treatment failure and disease metastasis.
Ample evidence has suggested that CSCs isolated
from solid tumors share similar characteristics with HSCs
[26-28]. Indeed, several signalling pathways involved
in HSC maintenance were also found to be activated in
CSCs. For example, CXCL12/CXCR4 was found to be
a key regulator of tumor dissemination in cancer cells
[29-31], including prostate cancer cells [10, 32] and it
also plays an important role in the activation of prostate
progenitor cells [33]. Recently, KITLG/c-Kit was found to
be involved in CSC maintenance in different cancer types,
including prostate cancer [34-37]. Moreover, these studies
also showed that the c-Kit receptor was highly expressed
in human prostate tumors that metastasized to the bone

Discussion
In this study, we showed that a rare population of
Tie-2-positive cells are present in bone metastatic prostate
cancer cell lines (PC-3, C42b and MDA-PCa-2b). These
cells not only demonstrated an increased ability to adhere
to osteoblasts and endothelial cells but were also found
to be more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs when
compared to the Tie-2Low population. More importantly,
we found that these cells were capable of developing
into metastatic tumors in vivo, even when a low number

[38]. It is therefore not surprising that the Ang-1/Tie-2
signaling pathway may also play a key role in regulating
the stemness of prostate CSCs, particularly because Tie-2
was found to be expressed by glioma stem cell populations
[22]. Indeed, our results suggest that activation of Tie-2
may be required for maintaining both the stemness and
quiescent state of prostate cancer cells. The finding that
the Tie-2High population was more resistant to Cabazitaxel
further supports this notion. Meanwhile, we also observed
a significant increase in HSC factors/markers (KITLG,
CXCR4 and FGF1) in Tie-2High PC-3 cells when compared
to the Tie-2Low population, further suggesting that Tie-2High
prostate cancer cells are similar to HSCs.
Prostate cancer cells are known to actively secrete a
large amount of Ang-1, which induces tumor angiogenesis
by binding to and activating Tie-2 in endothelial cells [39,
40]. Our finding that prostate cancer cells also express
functional Tie-2 suggests that Ang-1 may also function
through an autocrine loop. Indeed, knockdown of either
Ang-1 or Tie-2 was found to downregulate CSC and
quiescence markers in PC-3 and C42B cells. Further
support was derived from the finding that C42B cells,
which express the highest level of Ang-1, failed to respond
to exogenous Ang-1 unless endogenous Ang-1 was
knocked down by siRNA transfection (data not shown).
It is worth noting that autocrine loops such as KITLG/cKit and CXCL12/CXCR4 may also exist, although their
underlying functions and therapeutic potential remain to
be elucidated.
Apart from regulating the stemness of HSC, the
Ang-1/Tie-2 pathway is also known to facilitate the
adhesion of HSCs to the osteoblastic niche [15]. Similarly,
in our in vitro adhesion assays, compared to Tie-2Low cells,
Tie-2High PC-3 cells were more adhesive to osteosarcoma
MG-63 and SaOS-2 cells. This result suggests that Tie2 receptor may also play a key role in mediating the
adhesion of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts. This
possibility was further confirmed by our finding that Tie2 overexpression promoted the adhesion of DU145 cells
to osteoblast cells. Interestingly, similar effects were also
observed in endothelial cells, where Tie-2High PC-3 cells
showed increased adhesion to endothelial cells, where
Tie-2High PC-3 showed increased adhesion to endothelial
cells. Because both intravasation and extravasation of
tumor cells required their active adhesion to endothelial
cells [41, 42], it is conceivable that Tie-2 may play roles in
both processes during the development of prostate tumor
metastasis and that Tie-2High prostate cancer cells are
likely to be more metastatic. This was indeed confirmed
by the finding that injection of only 3,000 Tie-2High cells
could induce the formation of metastatic tumors in vivo.
Interestingly, kidney metastasis was found in one of the
mice, which may reflect the rich blood supply of the
kidney tissue. Indeed, sub-renal capsule grafting has been
shown to provide the optimum microenvironment for
tumor growth, and was most efficient in terms of uptake

rate (>90%) for both benign and malignant prostate tissues
[43].
In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time
that Tie-2 is expressed by a rare population of prostate
cancer cells and plays an important role in regulating the
stemness and metastatic ability of the cells (summarized
in Suppl Figure 4). Our results highlight the therapeutic
potential of targeting Tie-2 with existing inhibitors for the
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, which warrants
further investigation.

(J-003178-11 and J-003178-12) and Ang-1 (J-00780207 and J-007802-08) as well as a scrambled RNA oligo
were purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA.
Cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA using
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the cells were lysed for Western blotting
analysis or for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis.

Flow cytometry analysis and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS)
Cells were collected, washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 50 µl of FACS
buffer (0.02% sodium azide and 2% FBS in PBS) before
incubating with the fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies
at 4°C in the dark for 30 minutes. After incubation, the
cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently
resuspended in 200 µl of FACS buffer. Flow cytometry
analysis was performed using BD™ LSR II as described
in the manufacturer’s instruction manual, and the results
were analyzed using KALUZA software.
For cell sorting, PC-3 cells were stained with
2580

Oncotarget

Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated Tie-2 antibody in 200
µl of FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) at 4°C in the dark
for 2 hours and the corresponding IgG isotype was used
as negative control. After incubation, cells were washed
twice with PBS and then resuspended in 500 µl of FACS
buffer. The Tie-2High population was sorted using the
Beckman Coulter MoFloAstrio.

prior to being washed with TBS-T buffer. The membrane
was then incubated with the corresponding secondary
antibodies for another hour at room temperature. After
washing with TBS-T buffer, the membrane was incubated
with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP
Substrate (Millipore), and the signals were visualized
using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ XRS Gel Documentation
System.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Hoechst33342/ Pyronin Y (HO/PY) quiescent
staining

Sections rehydrated with standard procedures were
incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 10 minutes at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was
performed with sodium citrate buffer at pH 6 in a pressure
cooker for 10 minutes. Sections were then blocked with
normal goat serum diluted in TBS for 1 hour. After the
blocking, the sections were incubated with antibody
against Tie-2 (1: 5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, USA) for 1 hour, followed by a 1 hour incubation
with biotinylated rabbit secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and a 30 minute
incubation with VECTASTAIN® ABC Reagent complex.
Signals were developed with the ImmPACT DAB
Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate (Vector Laboratories). Slides
were then counterstained with hematoxylin (Biocare
Medical, Concord, CA, USA) before being mounted for
analysis under the microscope.

To determine the percentage of quiescent cells, all
cells were first stained with 10 µg/ml HO for 45 minutes in
the dark at 37°C. The cells were then incubated with 5 µM
PY for another 45 minutes in the dark at 37°C as described
in previous studies [46-48]. After staining, the cells were
analyzed using BD™ LSR II, and the results were further
analyzed using KALUZA software.

Annexin V staining
To determine the percentage of apoptotic
cells, Annexin V staining was performed using BD
Pharmingen™ Annexin V-FITC kits following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Tie-2High and Tie-2Low
PC-3 cells were washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended
in 100µl of 1X binding buffer and then incubated with
Annexin V-FITC antibody and propidium iodide in the
dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. After incubation,
the apoptotic cells were analyzed using BD™ LSR II,
and the results were further analyzed using KALUZA
software.

Generation of the stable Tie-2 overexpressing line
DU145 cells overexpressing Tie-2 (DU-Tie-2-GFP)
were generated using the lentiviral gene delivery system
as described in our previous study [44]. Briefly, pLenti6Tie-2-GFP or the empty vector control was transfected
into 293FT cells for lentiviral packaging. Viruses were
collected and used to infect DU145 cells in the presence
of polybrene (8µg/ml). Positive transfectants were selected
with blasticidin (10µg/ml) and were further enriched by
FACS based on the GFP signal.

Ang-1 ELISA
To quantitate Ang-1 secretion by the prostate cancer
cells, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium
for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and counted
using a Scepter™ Automated Cell Counter (Millipore).
Conditioned medium was collected and concentrated
using the 10K Amicon Ultra2-ml Centrifugal Filters
(Millipore). The medium was analyzed using the Human
Angiopoietin-1 DuoSet kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and
the positive signals were determined using a LUMIstar
OPTIMA Luminescence Microplate Reader and then,
normalized it to the cell numbers.

Western blot
Details regarding the experimental procedures
have been described in our previous studies [45]. Briefly,
whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cell pellets
with lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 100 µM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The cell lysates were quantitated
using the Pierce™ BCAProtein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) before loading onto a
SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were then
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), and the membrane was subsequently probed
with the indicated antibody for 1 hour at room temperature

or SaOS-2 cells. The cells were incubated for 30 minutes
in the dark at 37°C. Unattached cells were dispersed
with PBS, and the adherent cells were quantified using
a LUMIstar OPTIMA Luminescence Microplate Reader.
This experiment was repeated in the presence of 5 µM
Tie-2 inhibitor or an equal volume of DMSO as a control.
The data are presented as the fluorescence intensity from
triplicate experiments.

Animal studies

6.	

All animal studies were conducted in accordance
with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use
of Animals for Scientific Purposes and were approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee at the Queensland
University of Technology (Approval No: 1100001393).
Tumor metastasis were examined via intra-cardiac tumor
cell injection using procedures described previously [23].
Briefly, the Tie-2High population was isolated from PC3Luc cells, which were stably transfected with a luciferase
expression construct [44]. Three thousand Tie-2High or
Tie-2Low cells were suspended in 100 µl of PBS before
injecting into the left cardiac ventricle of 6-8-weekold male NOD-SCID mice (n = 8). Tumor metastasis
were monitored every 2 weeks for a total of 8 weeks
by intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg)
followed by bioluminescence imaging. The signal was
detected using the Xenogen IVIS 100 imaging system.
Mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and ex
vivo bioluminescence imaging was performed to confirm
the incidence of metastasis. Statistical analysis was
performed with the two-tailed t test, and differences were
considered to be significant if p < 0.05.
