Abstract
The antitumor effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of angiogenesis are hampered in patients by the rapid
development of tumor resistance, notably through increased invasiveness and accelerated metastasis. Here, we
reevaluated the role of the endogenous antiangiogenic thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) in prostate carcinomas in which
angiogenesis is an active process. In xenografted tumors, we observed that TSP1 altogether inhibited angiogenesis
and fostered tumor development. Our results show that TSP1 is a potent stimulator of prostate tumor cell
migration. This effect required CD36, which also mediates TSP1 antiangiogenic activity, and was mimicked by an
antiangiogenic TSP1-derived peptide. As suspected for pharmacologic inhibitors of angiogenesis, the TSP1
capacities to increase hypoxia and to trigger cell migration are thus inherently linked. Importantly, although
antiangiogenic TSP1 increases hypoxia in vivo, our data show that, in turn, hypoxia induced TSP1, thus generating
a vicious circle in prostate tumors. In radical prostatectomy specimens, we found TSP1 expression signiﬁcantly
associated with invasive tumors and with tumors which eventually recurred. TSP1 may thus help select patients at
risk of prostate-speciﬁc antigen relapse. Together, the data suggest that intratumor disruption of the hypoxic
cycle through TSP1 silencing will limit tumor invasion. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7649–58. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Studies over the past 30 years have shown that angiogenesis
is a key process in progression of cancer from an in situ lesion to
invasive and metastatic disease, providing the rationale for the
development of antiangiogenic therapies. Several antiangiogenic molecules are already in use or under clinical trial to treat
various cancers, including prostate tumors (1). These treatments, which mostly target the VEGF pathway, can lead to
disease stabilization and longer periods of progression free
survival, but substantial beneﬁts remain unrealized for the vast
majority of patients in terms of overall survival because tumors
elicit evasive resistance (2). Recent evidences in preclinical

models suggest that anti-VEGF therapies, although inhibiting
the growth of primary tumors, promote tumor invasiveness
and metastasis (3, 4). Treatment of mice with the antiangiogenic sunitinib was recently shown to foster the implantation
into lungs of intravenously injected tumor cells (4). Interestingly, a comparable effect was reported more than 20 years ago
with the endogenous antiangiogenic molecule Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1; ref. 5), and the TSP1-derived antiangiogenic
peptide ABT-510 failed to show antitumor effects in 2 phase
II clinical trials (6, 7). We hypothesized that the capacities to
increase hypoxia and to trigger cell migration were inherently
linked and that this link was shared by endogenous and
pharmacologic inhibitors of angiogenesis. We thus reevaluated
in experimental and clinical prostate tumors the role of TSP1,
the ﬁrst antiangiogenic molecule characterized (8).
TSP1 is a large—450 kDa—trimeric calcium-binding molecule composed of several domains (9), which binds to numerous ligands and receptors, including several integrins and the
scavenger receptor CD36. TSP1 inhibits in vitro the migration
of endothelial cells and induces their apoptosis (10). TSP1
expression is inhibited in a large number of tumors, including
breast and androgen-dependent prostate carcinomas (ADCaP)
in which there is an inverse correlation between TSP1 expression and microvessel density (MVD; refs. 11–13). The growth of
prostate tumors is initially strictly dependent on androgens,
and androgen ablation efﬁciently inhibits tumor growth. However, tumors eventually become resistant to castration, and
recur with a poor prognosis. We previously reported that TSP1
expression is high, and no longer associated with a reduced
MVD, in castration-resistant prostate carcinomas (CRCaP;

ref. 11), and in breast metastases (12), suggesting that TSP1
might stimulate tumor development. We therefore analyzed in
prostate tumors the functions of TSP1 and the mechanisms
controlling its expression, notably by regulators of calcium
homeostasis and hypoxia.
It is now well established that calcium, which binds to the
type III repeats of TSP1 and modiﬁes its folding and properties (9, 14), regulates proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis of cancer cells (15). The role of calcium signaling
in migration and metastasis becomes now more and more
evident. Indeed, the cyclic morphologic and adherence
changes observed during cell migration are accompanied
by repetitive changes in intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2þ]i) depending on Ca2þ inﬂux through channels located on the plasma membrane. The molecular nature
of these channels in migrating cells, and even more so for
metastatic cancer cells, is still largely unknown. Accumulating evidences suggest that the development of some
cancers involves ion channel aberrations, notably in the
prostate in which several nonvoltage-dependent cationic
channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family
were shown to be key players in calcium homeostasis (15).
For instance, TRPM8 (16), TRPV6 (15), and TRPV2 (17) are
differentially expressed between normal prostate and prostate carcinomas, and androgens regulate the expression of
TRPM8 and TRPV3 (18). We therefore studied the role of
calcium and calcium-permeable channels in the regulation
of TSP1 and in the migration of prostate cancer cells.

Patients, Materials, and Methods
Reagents and siRNA
Camphor, thapsigargin, and COCl2 were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier). TSP1 antibodies (Ab1, Ab-4, and Ab-11) were from Neomarkers (Interchim), tubulin
antibody from Sigma-Aldrich, collagen IV antibody from Novotec, hamster anti-CD31 clone 2H8 from Pierce, and Alexa-Fluor
goat anti-rabbit 488 and Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse 568 were
purchased from Molecular probes. siRNAs were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Sequences used are indicated in Supplementary Table S1. ABT-510 was a generous gift from Abbott
laboratories.
Cell culture and transfection
LNCaP and C4-2 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10%
fetal calf serum, PC-3 cells in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Hiperfect reagent
(Qiagen) was used to transfect cells in 24-well plates with the
indicated siRNAs (10 nmol/L) as recommended by the manufacturer. For hypoxic conditions, cells were cultured at 37 C
with 5% CO2, 94% N2, and 1% O2 in a hypoxic incubator (Binder
GmbH). In some experiments, to mimic hypoxia, cells were
grown in the presence of 300 mmol/L cobalt chloride.
Migration assay
Migration capacity was measured by Transwell assays (BD
Biosciences). Cells (40,000) were seeded in RPMI 1% FBS in
the upper part of a cell culture-chamber-insert system

7650

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

separated from the lower chamber by a 8 mm PET membrane. RPMI 10% FBS, or cell-conditioned medium, was
added in the lower compartment as indicated. Eighteen
hours later, nonmigrating cells in the upper compartment
were scrapped off with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower side
of the membrane were ﬁxed with methanol at 20 C and
stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes
were then excised, mounted on a glass side with glycergel
(Dako) and cells counted.
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, siRNA, and mRNA
analysis
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA was retrotranscribed using the High capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was
quantiﬁed by real-time PCR using the Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Human cyclophilin A was
used as an internal control. Sequences of the PCR primers are
indicated in Supplementary Table S2.
ELISA
TSP1 and VEGF protein contents in cell homogenates and
supernatant were measured by ELISA (Quantikine, R&D
systems).
Calcium imaging
Cytosolic Caþþ concentration was measured using ratiometric dye Fura-2 (Invitrogen Ltd.) and quantiﬁed as described
(19). Cells were loaded with 1 mmol/L Fura-2/AM for 45
minutes, washed and bathed for at least 10 minutes in a
solution containing 140 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1
mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 10 mmol/L glucose,
before measuring Ca2þ.
Animals, siRNA injection, and tumorigenicity assays
Studies involving animals, including housing and care,
method of euthanasia, and experimental protocols, were conducted in accordance with the local animal ethical committee
in the Institut Andre Lwoff in Villejuif, France. Tumor cells
(2  106 cells/mouse) were injected subcutaneously in 50%
(v:v) Matrigel (BD Biosciences) to 6- to 8-week-old male nude
mice and tumors were measured every day. When tumors grew
exponentially, siRNA diluted in PBS was injected i.p. on a daily
basis (120 mg/kg). Tumor volume was estimated by the formula: length  width2  0.5.
Subjects
Prostate tissue samples were obtained from 35 patients
who underwent radical prostatectomy. Written consent was
obtained from each patient. Immediately after prostate
removal, small pieces of tissues were gross dissected by the
pathologist, snap frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen until
analysis in tumor banks of the Centre hospitalier Lyon Sud
(Lyon, France), groupe hospitalier Cochin-Saint Vincent de
Paul (Paris, France), or CHU Henri Mondor (Creteil, France).
Histologic analysis of a frozen section was conducted for
each sample by the same pathologist before RNA extraction.
The fragments fully constituted of cancerous glands were

Antiangiogenic TSP1 Promotes Prostate Tumor Progression

not contain cancerous tissue were selected and named
"peritumoral tissue."

TSP1 is repressed in ADCaP but reexpressed in CRCaP
and AICaP cell lines
The TSP1 promoter is methylated in the ADCaP cell line
LNCaP (20) and accordingly, TSP1 mRNA and protein levels are
very low (Fig. 1A-B). In contrast, we found a sustained TSP1
expression in C4-2 cells, which were established from LNCaP
tumors recurring in mice after castration (21). TSP1 was also
found expressed, at the mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B)
levels, in the CRCaP cell line 22RV1, and in the androgenindependent (AICaP) PC3 cell line which does not express the
androgen receptor.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SEM. Differences between
means were studied using a 2-tailed t test or ANOVA when 2
groups or more than 2 groups were compared respectively. In

TSP1 stimulates the migration of prostate tumor cells
We used the above TSP1-siRNA (TSP1a-siRNA) and a second
one (TSP1b-siRNA) to study the mechanism of the protumoral
effect of TSP1 in prostate tumor cells in vitro. The 2 TSP1siRNAs silenced TSP1 expression over 70% at the mRNA and
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2B), with no effect on
cell proliferation or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2C–S2D).
In contrast, TSP1 silencing strongly inhibited the migration of
C4-2 cells in a Transwell assay (Fig. 2A). This effect was not
dependent upon the expression of the androgen receptor
because the migration of PC3 cells was also strongly affected
by TSP1 silencing (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the migration of LNCaP
cells, which do not express TSP1 and are poorly motile, was
stimulated when cells migrated towards C4-2 cells–conditioned medium (Fig. 2B). To further establish the role of TSP1
on the migration of prostate tumor cells, we took advantage of
a cell line, JT8, in which the production of TSP1 is under the
control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter (24). We prepared conditioned media from TSP1-induced or TSP1repressed JT8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E) and compared
their effect on the migration of C4-2 cells. The presence of TSP1
strongly increased the capacity of cells to migrate (Fig. 2C).
Antiangiogenic TSP1 peptides foster prostate cell
migration
TSP-1–derived peptides inhibiting endothelial cell migration and neovascularization in vivo have been characterized
(25). A stabilized derivative of one of these peptides, which
retains the antiangiogenic activity of TSP1 (26) was further

In vivo silencing of TSP1 increases MVD but inhibits the
growth of castration-resistant prostate tumors
We used RNA interference in vivo to address the role of TSP1
in C4-2 tumors. Tumor cells were xenografted into nude mice.
Once tumors were exponentially growing, mice were randomized for treatment and received daily a PBS i.p. injection, or
120 mg/kg of either control-, or a TSP1-siRNA diluted into PBS
and injected i.p. as previously described (22). As compared with
tumors treated with PBS, or with a control siRNA with no
known mRNA target, TSP1-siRNA reduced TSP1 mRNA levels
in tumors (Fig. 1D) and signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth
(Fig. 1C). The TSP1-siRNA did not activate the innate immune
system (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly, TSP1-siRNA
injected into mice bearing PC3 tumors inhibited tumor development (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Although the
growth of C4-2 tumors was blunted by TSP1-siRNA, MVD was
signiﬁcantly higher than in controls in C4-2 (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig. S1D) and in PC3 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
Several genes, including VEGF, GLUT1, and CA-IX are induced
under hypoxic conditions (23). The increased MVD paralleled a
reduced expression of these 3 genes in TSP1-siRNA–treated
tumors (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1F), strongly suggesting that blood vessels were functional. These results establish
that the antiangiogenic properties of TSP1 are maintained in
castration-resistant and androgen-independent prostate
tumors. They also show that TSP1 stimulates the development
of these tumors, and that this property is dominant over its
antiangiogenic effects.

Transwell assay, ABT-510 induced a 3.5-fold increase in the
number of LNCaP migrating cells (Fig. 2D).
TSP1-induced migration requires CD36
The antiangiogenic properties of TSP1 are mediated by its
binding to the CD36 receptor (26, 27) which we previously
found induced by androgen ablation and expressed in CRCaP
tumors in patients (11). TSP1 antibody A4.1 inhibits the
interaction between TSP1 and CD36 and blocks TSP1 antiangiogenic activity (25). This antibody inhibited by 65% the
migration of C4-2 cells (Fig. 2E). Similarly, transfection of C4-2
cells with an siRNA silencing CD36 (Supplementary Fig. S2F)
cells also inhibited cell migration by 65% (Fig. 2F). Altogether

Antiangiogenic TSP1 Promotes Prostate Tumor Progression

expression in LNCaP cells, as observed for TSP1 (Fig. 1A). In C42 cells, the basal [Ca2þ]i was not signiﬁcantly affected by
TRPV3 silencing but was increased 1.6-fold by thapsigargininduced store depletion (Fig. 3C), indicating that this channel
was regulating calcium homeostasis, possibly through an ER
membrane localization. TRPV3 silencing in PC3 cells increased
the basal [Ca2þ]i level but only marginally affected thapsigargin-induced store depletion (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Treatment of C4-2 cells with camphor, a well-established agonist of
TRPV3 and TRPV1 (31, 32), induced after 2 hours a dosedependent secretion of TSP1 in the culture medium (Fig. 3D),
followed after 6 hours by a dose-dependent increase in TSP1
mRNA level (Fig. 3E). These results suggested that TRP channels might regulate TSP1 expression and cell migration.
Indeed, silencing TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV6 or TRPM8, resulted
into a reduced TSP1 level in C4-2 cells (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). In contrast, TRPC4 and TRPC6
silencing increased TSP1 mRNA level in C4-2 cells, whereas
TRPC1, TRPC3 or ORAI had no signiﬁcant effect (Fig. 3F). In
addition, silencing TRPV3 or TRPM8 inhibited C4-2 cells
migration as efﬁciently as TSP1-siRNA, whereas silencing
TRPC4 or TRPC6 stimulated cell migration (Fig. 3G). We chose
to further analyze the regulation of TSP1 expression by TRPV3

these results show that the promigratory and antiangiogenic
properties of TSP1 are closely linked at the molecular level.
TSP1 expression and secretion are regulated by cytosolic
calcium concentration
We next sought the mechanisms inducing TSP1 in prostate
tumors. Each TSP1 molecule binds approximately 35 calcium
ions (28), which modiﬁes its folding. TSP1 silencing signiﬁcantly
increased the basal cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2þ]i) in
C4-2 (Fig. 3A) and PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), showing
that, directly or indirectly, TSP1 contributes to regulate calcium
concentration in prostate tumor cells. Because a 2-hour treatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA pump which
increases [Ca2þ]i, induced TSP1 secretion (Supplementary Fig.
S3B–S3C), we investigated whether reciprocally the cytosolic
calcium concentration in prostate tumor cells could regulate the
expression and secretion of TSP1 and cell migration.
Several channels of the TRP family, which are deregulated
during prostate tumor progression (15), actively regulate
[Ca2þ]i in prostate cells, in particular TRPV2, TRPV6, and
TRPM8 (16, 17, 29, 30). TRPV3 was recently described as an
androgen-receptor target gene (18) and we found this channel
expressed in prostate tumor cell lines (Fig. 3B), with a reduced

TSP1 expression is associated with invasion and cancer
recurrence after radical prostatectomy
In prostate tumors, TSP1 inhibits angiogenesis and thus
increases hypoxia. Our results show that in turn, hypoxia
induces TSP1 which fosters cell migration. A vicious circle is
thus likely to take place as tumors progress toward more
advanced and invasive stages. To test this hypothesis, we
quantiﬁed TSP1 mRNA level in 35 frozen radical prostatectomy
specimens from patients with clinically localized prostate

Secreted TSP1,

Hypoxia modiﬁes calcium homeostasis in C4-2 cells and
induces TSP1 expression
The antitumoral properties of antiangiogenic molecules rely
on their capacity to increase hypoxia. One of the constant early
responses to hypoxia in almost all cell types is an increase in
[Ca2þ]i (33). We thus analyzed how hypoxia affected calcium
homeostasis and TSP1 expression in prostate tumor cells. As
compared with normoxia, hypoxia induced in C4-2 cells a 2.2fold increase in [Ca2þ]i level after thapsigargin-induced store
depletion (Fig 4A). TRPV3 silencing further increased both
resting and thapsigargin-induced [Ca2þ]i levels in hypoxia.
Similar results were obtained in PC3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). These data suggested that TSP1 could also be
induced by hypoxia. We thus measured in C4-2 cells grown
in 1% or 20% oxygen, the expression and secretion of TSP1. We
observed a time-dependent increase of both TSP1 and VEGF
mRNA levels in hypoxia as compared with normoxia (Fig. 4B).
TSP1 protein was synthesized in hypoxia (Fig. 4C) and secreted
in the cell culture medium (Fig. 4D). TSP1 was also induced by
hypoxia in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and its secretion
in cell culture medium was induced by thapsigargin and
Colbalt Chloride treatments (Supplementary Fig. S5C).

TSP1 mediates the regulation of prostate tumor cell
migration by TRPV3
To further analyze the relative contributions of TSP1 and
TRPV3 in cell migration, we prepared conditioned medium
from control- or TSP1-siRNA–transfected C4-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3H). We then measured in Transwell assays the
migration of control, or TRPV3-silenced C4-2 cells, toward
control, or TSP1-depleted media. Consistent with the results
shown in Fig. 3G, migration of TRPV3-silenced cells toward
TSP1-depleted medium was inhibited by 86% (Fig. 3H). Importantly, addition of TSP1 in the lower compartment fully
restored migration of TRPV3-silenced cells (Fig. 3H), showing
that the stimulation of cell migration by TRPV3 is mediated by
the secreted TSP1.
Using the same protocol as for TSP1-siRNA, we treated mice
bearing exponentially growing C4-2 or PC3 tumors with
TRPV3-siRNA daily. TRPV3-siRNA treatment was as efﬁcient
as TSP1 to inhibit tumor development in the 2 tumor models
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).

The antiangiogenic functions of TSP1 in tumors, extensively
showed in most tumor models, are exempliﬁed by the inverse
correlation between TSP1 expression and MVD in androgendependent prostate carcinomas (11, 13, 34). TSP1 expression is
inhibited by promoter methylation in the androgen-dependent
cell line LNCaP (20), but surprisingly, reexpressed in C4-2 cells,
a castration-resistant derivative of LNCaP cells, and in androgen-independent PC3 cells. This TSP1 reexpression is also
observed in CRCaP in patients in which angiogenesis is an
active process (11). TSP1 reexpression in CRCaP and AICaP is
not fortuitous as TSP1 silencing blunted tumor development in
vivo (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B), showing that TSP1
actively stimulates tumor growth, as observed in other experimental (5, 35) and clinical situations (12, 36). Indeed, our
experiments show that TSP1, which does not regulate CRCaP
cell proliferation or apoptosis, is a potent trigger of tumor cell
migration. This property was also observed in other cell types
(35), and notably in a glioblastoma model, in which the overexpression of an N-terminal fragment of TSP1 gave rise to less
angiogenic but more invasive tumors (37). Recently, it was also
reported that the growth of primary tumors is increased in
TSP1 knockout mice, whereas the number of metastases is
decreased (38).
We investigated if, in addition to its stimulatory effect on
tumor cell migration, TSP1 could have lost its antiangiogenic
effects in CRCaP and AICaP. This might occur through an

increased secretion of proangiogenic factors (24), or through
a lack of TSP1 secretion. The latter was described in renal
cell carcinomas in which a decreased expression of TRPC4
impaired calcium uptake and TSP1 secretion (39). In CRCaP,
however, TSP1 is secreted, and this secretion is fostered
by hypoxia (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S5C) or by an
increase in [Ca2þ]i (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Figs. S3B and
S5C). In addition, silencing TSP1 increased tumor MVD
(Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E), showing that
TSP1 is still antiangiogenic in CRCaP. It might seem paradoxical that silencing an antiangiogenic molecule inhibits
tumor development. A similar situation was described for
DLL4: the inhibition of this antiangiogenic factor increased
MVD but reduced tumor development (40). However, DLL4
regulates the speciﬁcation of tip cells and thus, despite an
increased MVD, hypoxia was increased in DLL4-inhibited
tumors because blood vessels were not functional. The
antitumoral effects associated with TSP1 silencing are likely
mediated by a different mechanism: TSP1, through its binding to CD36, induces apoptosis of endothelial cells (10), and
in TSP1-siRNA–treated tumors the increased MVD was
associated with a reduced VEGF, GLUT1, and CA-IX mRNA
levels (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig. S1F), indicative of a
reduced hypoxia, suggesting that blood vessels in TSP1silenced tumors are functional. It thus seems that the
proinvasive effects of TSP1 in CRCaP are dominant over its
antiangiogenic effects.
TSP1 folding and functions depend on the binding of
calcium ions (9, 14) whose intracellular concentration is
tightly regulated (41). In C4-2 cells, at least 6 membrane
receptors of the TRP family regulated the TSP1 expression
positively—TRPM8, TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV6—or negatively—TRPC4 and TRPC6. Cell migration was induced by
TRPC4 or TRPC6 silencing, or, conversely, inhibited by
TRPM8 or TRPV3 silencing. In addition, in TRPV3-silenced
cells, migration was restored by the addition of TSP1 in the
extracellular medium, placing TSP1 as a central mediator of
the TRPV3 effect on cell migration. These results show that
intracellular calcium concentration is a major regulator of
TSP1 synthesis, secretion, and capacity to induce cell migration. In patients, while prostate tumor progresses, the intracellular calcium homeostasis is disrupted, at least in part
because the expression of several TRP channels is deregulated, notably TRPV2 (17), TRPV6, and TRPM8 (42). This
mechanism thus most likely participates in the upregulation
of TSP1 expression and secretion during prostate tumor
progression.
Hypoxia, which spontaneously increases during prostate
tumor progression (43), is associated with a shorter time to
biochemical failure or progression free survival (44, 45). One
of the early events induced by hypoxia is an increase in
[Ca2þ]i (33), notably through TRP channels (46, 47). TRPV3
appears as an important regulator of calcium homeostasis in
hypoxia in prostate tumor cells, as its silencing markedly
increased [Ca2þ]i levels in C4-2 and PC3 cells. Because
calcium homeostasis is an important regulator of TSP1
secretion and synthesis, we studied the effect of hypoxia
on TSP1 expression. Importantly, hypoxia increased TSP1

protein synthesis and secretion (Fig. 4B, 4C, Supplementary
Fig. S5B and S5C). TSP1 translation in hypoxia likely occurs
through an internal ribosome entry site recently described in
the 50 TSP1 mRNA (48). Hypoxia was also reported to induce
TSP1 in heart infarction, in wound healing (49), and in
several situations of ischemia in the retina, brain, leg (50),
and kidney. In atherosclerotic lesions, hypoxia-induced TSP1
expression promotes migration of vascular smooth muscle
cells (51), showing that the interplay between hypoxia, TSP1,
and cell migration is not restricted to tumor cells. Likely,
TSP1-induced migration helps cells survive escaping the
hypoxic environment.
The antiangiogenic effects of TSP1 are mediated by its
binding to CD36 (10, 27). The TSP1–CD36 interaction also
stimulates resorption by osteoclasts (52) and induces TIMP-1
production and secretion in prostate and breast tumor cell
lines (53). In addition, our results now establish that TSP1
promotes prostate tumor cell migration. This function also
requires CD36 as silencing of this receptor, or inhibition of the
TSP1–CD36 interaction using speciﬁc antibodies, impaired
migration. The TSP1-mimetic antiangiogenic peptide ABT510 also stimulated migration in LNCaP cells although the
role of CD36 in that activity was not investigated. These results
support the hypothesis that the capacity of TSP1 to stimulate
cell migration, invasion, and tumor dissemination is intrinsically linked to its capacity to increase hypoxia. Similarly,
hypoxia triggered by pharmacologic antiangiogenic drugs
induces invasion (3, 4). These observations strongly suggest
that the increased invasion and formation of distant metastasis
in hypoxia occurs whatever the trigger of hypoxia. This is of
particular importance in the treatment of prostate cancers
because castration, the ﬁrst-line treatment for invasive prostate tumors, represses VEGF (54) and induces TSP1 (11, 13, 55),
creating a hypoxic stress which contributes to the antitumoral
effect. Because hypoxia induces VEGF, the VEGF repression
is only transient, and in the prostate of castrated rats, VEGF
returns to control levels after 3 days (54). No such feedback
mechanism occurs for TSP1, as castration induces TSP1
which increases hypoxia, which in turn induces TSP1 expression in a vicious circle. Castration-resistant cells express
TSP1, which stimulates their migration. These cells, which
proliferate in low testosterone levels, have enhanced migrating capabilities, and resist to hypoxia, are prone to give rise
to aggressive metastases. Disrupting this vicious circle
silencing TSP1 in patients undergoing chemical castration
should help controlling cell dissemination in response to
hypoxia-induced castration. In addition, our experimental
data show that TSP1 silencing increases MVD. Therefore,
association of TSP1 silencing with chemotherapeutic treatments should also be beneﬁcial, improving penetration of
therapeutic agents, and inhibiting invasion and metastasis
dissemination.
Importantly, in radical prostatectomy specimens taken
before any other treatment, we observed an increased TSP1
mRNA level in pT3b as compared with less invasive pT3aand pT2-staged cancers and a statistically higher tumoral
TSP1 expression in patients who experienced tumor recurrence. This ﬁnding may be of importance: with the

development of PSA screening, the number of so called
"clinically insigniﬁcant cancers" has increased dramatically.
TSP1 expression on prostate biopsies may have an incremental staging value in clinical practice, and improve identiﬁcation of indolent tumors, thus avoiding unnecessary
radical and possibly morbid treatment such as radical
prostatectomy. On radical prostatectomy specimens, TSP1
mRNA may also be of clinical interest to select patients at
risk of PSA relapse and propose additional treatments such
as adjuvant radiotherapy.
