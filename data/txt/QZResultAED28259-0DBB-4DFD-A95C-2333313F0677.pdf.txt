ABSTRACT
Although the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, everolimus,
has improved the outcome of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), improvement
is temporary due to the development of drug resistance. Since many patients
encountering resistance turn to alternative/complementary treatment options, an
investigation was initiated to evaluate whether the natural compound, sulforaphane
(SFN), influences growth and invasive activity of everolimus-resistant (RCCres)
compared to everolimus-sensitive (RCCpar) RCC cell lines in vitro. RCC cells were
exposed to different concentrations of SFN and cell growth, cell proliferation,
apoptosis, cell cycle, cell cycle regulating proteins, the mTOR-akt signaling axis,
adhesion to human vascular endothelium and immobilized collagen, chemotactic
activity, and influence on surface integrin receptor expression were investigated. SFN
caused a significant reduction in both RCCres and RCCpar cell growth and proliferation,
which correlated with an elevation in G2/M- and S-phase cells. SFN induced a marked
decrease in the cell cycle activating proteins cdk1 and cyclin B and siRNA knock-down
of cdk1 and cyclin B resulted in significantly diminished RCC cell growth. SFN also
modulated adhesion and chemotaxis, which was associated with reduced expression
of the integrin subtypes α5, α6, and β4. Distinct differences were seen in RCCres
adhesion and chemotaxis (diminished by SFN) and RCCpar adhesion (enhanced by SFN)
and chemotaxis (not influenced by SFN). Functional blocking of integrin subtypes
demonstrated divergent action on RCC binding and invasion, depending on RCC cell
sensitivity to everolimus. Therefore, SFN administration could hold potential for
treating RCC patients with established resistance towards everolimus.

INTRODUCTION

the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and sorafenib, and
the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors,
temsirolimus and everolimus. Compared to cytokine
therapy with interferon a or interleukin-2 [3], these target
agents have substantially improved patient outcome,
but are not curative since resistance inevitably develops
during tyrosine kinase or mTOR inhibitor therapy.
Dissatisfaction, along with strong side effects
caused by conventional treatment have driven cancer
patients to seek “alternative” and/or “complementary”
care options to conventional treatment. “Complementary”

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common
kidney tumor with more than 330,000 diagnosed cases
and more than 140,000 patients succumbing to it every
year [1]. Approximately one third of these patients have
metastases at diagnosis, and 30–70% of patients with
localized disease relapse within 5 years of surgery [2].
During the last decade several targeted drugs have
been developed and approved as standard care for patients
with metastasized RCC. Licensed target agents include

is regarded as a non-mainstream approach used in addition
to conventional medicine, whereas “alternative” refers
to a non-mainstream approach instead of conventional
medicine [4]. Complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) has become popular among tumor patients with
more than 40% utilizing it worldwide [5]. In Europe,
CAM application ranges from 15 to more than 70%,
whereby herbal medicine is mostly employed [6]. In
recent years, isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SFN), found
in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage,
has received increasing attention. SFN has been shown to
inhibit tumor development and progression by modulating
cancer related cell signaling and gene transcription [7].
Inhibition is accomplished by activating apoptosis, by cell
cycle arrest, and by preventing metastatic processes [8].
Several epidemiologic studies have revealed a correlation
between high intake of SFN rich vegetables and reduced
cancer risk [9]. A clinical trial has provided evidence
that SFN down-regulates the prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level in men with prostate cancer and decreases
biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [10].
Since so many RCC patients turn to CAM once resistance
towards conventional therapy occurs, the present study
was directed towards investigating whether SFN might
indeed hold potential for patients with acquired drug
resistance. Accordingly, three RCC cell lines were driven
to non-responsiveness towards the mTOR-inhibitor
everolimus and the influence of SFN on tumor growth,
proliferation, and motility of everolimus-resistant and
everolimus-sensitive tumor cells was compared.

(Figure 1B). SFN did not induce early or late apoptosis, as
evidenced by the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit.

Cell cycle shifts during SFN and acute
everolimus application
Cell cycle analysis revealed an increased percentage
of Caki-1res cells in the G2/M-phase and an increased
number of KTCTL-26res and A498res cells in the G2/M- and
S-phases, compared to respective everolimus-sensitive
cells (Figure 2). In both Caki-1par and Caki-1res cells more
G2/M- and S-phase cells and less G0/G1-phase cells were
apparent when tumor cells were treated with 20 µM SFN
for 24 h (Figure 3A). Proliferation was elevated in Caki-1res
cells compared to Caki-1par cells, as evidenced by BrdU
incorporation (Figure 3B). SFN significantly lowered
proliferation of both Caki-1par and Caki-1res cells, as
demonstrated by reduced BrdU incorporation (compared
to untreated controls).

SFN alters expression of cell cycle regulating
proteins
The influence of SFN on Caki-1res differed from that
on Caki-1par in as much as total and activated Cdk1 and Cdk2
were elevated in the everolimus-resistant tumor cells. This
was also true with respect to cyclin B, p27, pAkt, pRaptor,
and pRictor (Figure 3C). In contrast, p19 was diminished in
Caki-1res compared to Caki-1par. SFN led to down-regulation
of Cdk1, pCdk2, and Cdk2 in both Caki-1par and Caki-1res.
Cyclin A, cyclin B (cyclin B > cyclin A) and p27 were
lowered as well. p19 was up-regulated by SFN. pAkt and
pRictor were down-regulated by SFN in Caki-1res, whereas
pRaptor was down-regulated by SFN in Caki-1par.

RESULTS
Growth of everolimus-sensitive and -resistant
RCC cells after everolimus application

Cyclin B-cdk1 knock-down

Everolimus application caused a dose dependent
significant reduction in the number of everolimus-sensitive
RCC cells generated over 48 h in all three cell lines,
Caki-1par, KTCTL-26par, and A498par cells. The reduction
was already apparent at 1 nM everolimus (Figure 1A).
Chronic, previous everolimus exposure induced resistance
to acute everolimus application. An everolimus induced
reduction in the growth rate greater than 20% was only
achieved in KTCTL-26res and A498res cells when they were
exposed to an acute dose of 500 or 1000 nM everolimus.

Since cyclin B and cdk1 were strongly down-regulated
by SFN in both Caki-1par and Caki-1res cells, this downregulation could be responsible for the SFN evoked RCC
cell growth reduction observed with the MTT assay. Figure
4 shows that treating Caki-1par and Caki-1res with cyclin B or
cdk1 specific siRNA reduced the cdk1 and cyclin B content
in both cell types. (Figure 4B) This was associated with
significant suppression of tumor cell growth (Figure 4A).

Influence of SFN on tumor cell adhesion and
motility

Growth of everolimus-sensitive and -resistant
RCC cells after SFN application

Caki-1par cells rapidly attached to HUVEC with no
difference in adherence after 30 and 120 min (Figure 5A).
More Caki-1res than Caki-1par cells attached to HUVEC
in the initial phase of HUVEC-tumor cell interaction
(30 min) but subsequently lost binding capacity, which was
lowest after 120 min. SFN significantly down-regulated

SFN dose-dependently suppressed growth of all
three everolimus-sensitive cell lines. It also diminished
growth of RCC cells with everolimus-resistance, although
the efficacy of SFN was lower in the everolimus-resistant
cells, compared to that of the everolimus-sensitive cells

Caki-1par cell binding to HUVEC (30 and 60 min values,
compared to the untreated control). Compared to untreated
Caki-1res controls, SFN reduced the number of HUVEC
bound Caki-1res cells after 30 min but binding was
enhanced after 60 and 120 min (Figure 5A). More Caki-1res
than Caki-1par cells adhered to collagen (Figure 5B) and
more Caki-1res than Caki-1par crawled underneath the
Transwell membrane (Figure 5C). SFN increased the
number of Caki-1par but decreased the amount of Caki-1res,
which attached to immobilized collagen (compared to
untreated controls; Figure 5B). SFN also significantly
diminished chemotaxis in Caki-1res but not in Caki-1par
cells (Figure 5C).

was down-regulated in Caki-1par but remained unchanged
in Caki-1res cells (Figure 6B).

Integrin α5, α6, and β4 blockade differentially
influence Caki-1res and Caki-1par adhesion and
migration
Since SFN strongly altered integrin α5, α6, and β4
expression, the relevance of these integrin types for the
adhesive and motile behaviour of the everolimus-sensitive
and everolimus-resistant Caki-1 cells was investigated.
Integrin blockade differentially influenced adhesion
and chemotaxis of Caki-1par compared to Caki-1res cells
(Figure  7). Blocking α5 triggered enhanced adhesion
(Figure 7A) and chemotactic (Figure 7B) behavior of Caki1par , but diminished adhesion and chemotactic behavior in
Caki-1res cells. A similar phenomenon was observed when
Caki-1 cells were treated with α6 or β4 function-blocking
antibodies, with the exception that adhesion of Caki-1res cells
was not altered by integrin β4 blockade and chemotaxis of
Caki-1par was not modulated by integrin α6 blockade.

Influence of SFN on integrin α and β expression
in Caki-1res and Caki-1par cells
Caki-1par revealed a slight or moderate expression
of the integrin subtypes α1, α2, α4, α6, and β4. Strong
expression was recorded for the integrins α3, α5, β1, and
β3 (Figure 6A). Everolimus-resistance was associated
with diminished expression of the integrins α1 – α5
and β3 (compared to everolimus-sensitive controls).
β1 integrin expression was the same in everolimusresistant and -sensitive cells, but integrins α6 and β4
were enhanced in everolimus-resistant cells. SFN
caused a reduction in integrins α5, α6, β1, and β4 with
stronger effects seen in Caki-1par than in Caki-1res.
SFN caused integrin β3 to become down-regulated
in Caki-1par but up-regulated in Caki-1res, whereas integrin α2

DISCUSSION
Resistance to everolimus in RCC cells was
associated with increased mitotic activity, loosening of
RCC-HUVEC contacts, increased interaction with a
collagen matrix and elevated chemotactic movement.
Earlier investigations have shown that everolimusresistance drives RCC cells towards high proliferation

and motility [11, 12]. SFN not only reduced growth of
everolimus-sensitive tumor cells but also counteracted
aggressive proliferative and invasive activity of
everolimus-resistant RCC cell lines.
The effect was most prominent with a concentration
of 20 µM. Whether this concentration can be attained under
therapeutic conditions in tumor patients remains to be seen,
since no pertinent studies are available. Cipolla et al., in
treating prostate cancer patients with SFN, employed an

oral dose of 60 mg/day, but provided no further details
about SFN metabolism or bioavailability [10]. The urine
concentration of dithiocarbamates, a group of SFNmetabolites, has been evaluated in clinical trials with
healthy volunteers to be about 20 µM after consuming
50 g/day [13] or 70 g/day broccoli sprouts [14].
In the presence of SFN cell cycle analysis revealed
tumor cell accumulation in the S- and G2/M-phase, with
accumulation in the G2/M-phase being greater than in the

S-phase in the parental (everolimus-sensitive) sublines.
SFN induced G2/M phase-arrest has also been observed
in osteosarcoma [15], bladder [16], colon [17], ovarian
[18], prostate [19], and breast cancer cells [20]. This
G2/M phase-arrest corroborates the SFN induced decrease
in RCC proliferation found in the present investigation.
An SFN induced down-regulation of the cyclin B-cdk1
axis also occurred in both everolimus-sensitive and
-resistant RCC. The G2/M phase arrest, coupled with
down-regulation of the cyclin B-cdk1 axis, caused by SFN
indicates that SFN inhibits mitotic processes.
Though SFN has been shown by other investigators
to reduce cdk1 [21, 22], it is not the rule. An increase in
cyclin B has been documented in bladder and prostate

cancer cells [23, 24] but no change has been reported
in colon cancer-derived tumors [25], indicating that the
influence of SFN may depend on the tumor entity. The
action of SFN on cyclin A also demonstrates dependence
on the tumor entity. In the present investigation cyclin
A was down-regulated in RCC cells. It has also been
reported to be down-regulated in osteosarcoma [26] and
colon carcinoma cells [27]. However, down-regulation has
not been reported in oral carcinoma cells [28].
The cell cycle regulator, p19, was up-regulated in
both Caki-1par and Caki-1res by SFN. This observation is
corroborated by several other investigations demonstrating
a negative association between p19 expression and
proliferative activity in a panel of solid tumor types [29–31].

It, therefore, seems likely that SFN triggered elevation of
p19, along with cdk-cyclin down-regulation, contributes to
the inhibition of RCC cell growth and proliferation.
Since p27 serves as a tumor suppressor, it was
expected that SFN would induce enhanced expression.
However, this expectation was foiled since application of
SFN caused diminished p27 expression in both everolimussensitive and -resistant tumor cells. Other investigators
have reported that applying SFN to several tumor cell
lines (but not to RCC cells) leads to p27 induction
[32, 33]. Another investigator found no modification of

p27 by SFN [34]. Mans et al. concluded that p27 induces
tumor cell senescence in RCC patients [35]. This is in line
with other investigators showing loss of p27 to correlate
with RCC recurrence and cancer-related patient death
[36]. Meanwhile, newer interpretation has been advanced
associating high cytoplasmic p27 expression with worse
cancer-specific survival in RCC [37]. Presumably, shifting
p27 from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment
could be predictive for poor outcome in RCC [38]. A
further aspect should also be considered. Besides cell
growth regulation, p27 also modifies cell-cell interaction,

driving RCC cell invasion and metastatic progression
forward [39]. Speculatively, SFN induced loss of p27
might hinder RCC cells in crossing the endothelial cell
barrier and settling as secondary tumors. The alteration
of adhesive and invasive behavior of RCC cells by SFN
seen in our in vitro assays, at least partially, corroborates
the assumption that diminished p27 expression not only
contributes to cell growth regulation but also prevents
RCC migration.
SFN exerted different influences on Caki-1par and
Caki-1res. The total tumor cell number was reduced more
when SFN was applied to everolimus-sensitive RCC
cells, compared to everolimus-resistant cells. Sensitive
tumor cells were mainly driven into the G2/M phase,
whereas the resistant cells were equally driven into the
G2/M and S-phases. The SFN induced inhibition of
proliferation was more intense in everolimus-resistant than
in -sensitive cells. The differences in tumor cell biology
were accompanied by differences in cell cycle protein
modifications. SFN caused diminished pCdk1 expression
in everolimus-resistant but not in -sensitive RCC cells,
whereas Cyclin A was reduced in the everolimus-sensitive
but not in the -resistant RCC cells. SFN suppressed
pRaptor in the everolimus-sensitive and pRictor in the
everolimus-resistant RCC cells. Since resistance is
characterized by altered cell signaling machinery, it is not
surprising that molecules within the signaling cascade are
altered differently in Caki-1res and Caki-1par cells when
SFN is applied. With respect to the mTOR sub-members
Rictor and Raptor, these protein complexes individually
modify cell cycle progression and proliferation [40, 41].
Divergent regulation of pRictor and pRaptor, depending
on everolimus sensitivity, might therefore account for the
different influence of SFN on the Caki-1 cell lines.
Different responses of Caki-1res and Caki-1par cells
to SFN were also apparent with respect to adhesion and
chemotaxis. Only a slight reduction in Caki-1par cells
bound to HUVEC was induced by SFN, attachment to
collagen was enhanced and motile behavior was not
influenced at all. In strong contrast, SFN prevented
Caki-1res from becoming highly adhesive or highly
motile. More Caki-1res cells attached to HUVEC after
120 min incubation in the presence of SFN, fewer cells
bound to collagen and only a few cells migrated. These
effects on the everolimus-resistant tumor cells open the
possibility that SFN might be a treatment option once
tumors have become non-responsive to conventional
drug treatment. SFN has recently been shown to reduce
the metastatic potential of drug-resistant breast cancer
cells in vitro [42]. There is also evidence that SFN might
overcome chemoresistance towards adriamycin, cisplatin
[43], doxorubicin [44], and paclitaxel [45]. The current
results demonstrate high efficacy of SFN in reducing
the metastatic potential of everolimus-resistant RCC
cells in vitro. Whether SFN can re-establish everolimus
sensitivity is currently under investigation.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SFN caused down-regulation of the integrin adhesion
receptors α5, α6, and β4 subtypes in both Caki-1par
and Caki-1res cells. This consistent down-regulation was
accompanied by enhanced binding of Caki-1par cells, but
blocked binding and chemotaxis of Caki-1res, indicating
different integrin function, depending on the drug
responsiveness of the tumor cells. For example blocking of
α5 was accompanied by elevated adhesion and chemotaxis
of Caki-1par, but by reduced adhesion and chemotaxis of
Caki-1res cells. Loss of β4 integrin enhanced motile activity
of Caki-1par, but reduced that of Caki-1res cells. Blockade
of integrin α6 led to up-regulation of Caki-1par adhesion,
but to a down-regulation of Caki-1res adhesion. Divergent
activity of a particular integrin is not uncommon and we
have recently reported that integrins undergo functional
changes during the process of resistance development,
driving tumor cells to become highly invasive [11, 46].
This disparity in integrin function may explain why
SFN treatment caused enhanced binding of everolimussensitive RCC cells to collagen but reduced binding in
everolimus-resistant cells. Diminished α5, α6, and β4
expression after SFN application could be responsible
for the diminished chemotactic behavior of Caki-1res.
Chemotaxis of Caki-1par cells was not influenced by SFN.
Possibly, integrin α6 reduction is irrelevant to motile
spreading of everolimus-sensitive cells and/or because
integrin α2 suppression, induced by SFN exclusively in
Caki-1par, might correlate with decreased chemotaxis [47],
(thereby counteracting the pro-chemotaxic effects induced
by α5 and β4 reduction). However SFN actually functions,
it triggers firm attachment of everolimus–sensitive RCC
to the collagen matrix, thereby indirectly preventing
invasive progression. In contrast, everolimus-resistant
cells are modified by SFN through direct inhibition of both
adhesion and chemotaxis. The direct action of SFN on
adhesion and penetration could be of potential importance
in treating patients with everolimus-resistant cancer.
Overall, SFN has been demonstrated to act on a
panel of RCC cell lines by reducing tumor growth and
proliferation in vitro. Verification in animals with acquired
everolimus resistant cancer must reveal whether the
potential of SFN seen in vitro can be substantiated in vivo.
If verified, then SFN might be of value in supporting
conventional therapy with an mTOR inhibitor in patients
with acquired resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
A panel of three RCC cell lines were initially
investigated (Caki-1, KTCTL-26, and A498). The effects
of everolimus and L-sulforaphane on cell growth and the
cell cycle were tested on all three of these cell lines in
an everolimus-sensitive and an everolimus-resistant state.

apoptosis, cell cycle regulating proteins, the mTOR-akt
signaling axis, adhesion to human vascular endothelium
and immobilized collagen, chemotactic activity, and
influence on surface α and β integrin receptor expression
were carried out only on Caki-1 cells.
Caki-1 and KTCTL-26 cells were purchased from
LGC Promochem (Wesel, Germany) and A498 cells
from Cell Lines Service (Heidelberg, Germany). Tumor
cells were grown and subcultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Seromed, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS), 20 mM HEPES-buffer, 1% glutamax
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all: Gibco/Invitrogen;
Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2
incubator. Subcultures from passages 5–24 were employed.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were harvested by enzymatic treatment with dispase
(Gibco/Invitrogen) and cultured in Medium 199 (M199;
Biozol, Munich, Germany), supplemented with 10%
FCS, 10% pooled human serum, 20 µg/ml endothelial cell
growth factor (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 0.1%
heparin, 100 ng/ml gentamycin and 20 mM HEPES-buffer
(pH 7.4). Subcultures from passages 2–6 were employed.

V-FITC and 5 μl of PI in the dark for 15 min at room
temperature. Cells were analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD
Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). The percentage of
vital, necrotic, and apoptotic cells (early and late) in each
quadrant was calculated using Cell-Quest software (BD
Biosciences).

Measurement of tumor cell growth and
proliferation
Cell growth was assessed using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) dye reduction assay (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg,
Germany). RCC cells (50 µl, 1 × 105 cells/ml) were
seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates. After 24, 48,
and 72 h MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added for an additional
4 h. Subsequently, cells were lysed in a buffer containing
10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl. The plates were incubated
overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. Absorbance at 550 nm was
determined for each well using a microplate ELISA reader.
Each experiment was done in triplicate. After subtracting
background absorbance, results were expressed as 24 – 72 h
cell growth rate calculated in percentage increase
compared to controls set at 100%.
Cell proliferation was measured using a BrdU
cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (Calbiochem/Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt,
Germany). Tumor cells, seeded onto 96-well microtitre
plates, were incubated with 20 µl BrdU-labeling solution
per well for 8 h, and then fixed and detected using antiBrdU mAb according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

Drug treatment
Everolimus (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel,
Switzerland) was dissolved in DMSO as a 10 mM
stock solution and stored in aliquots at −20°C. Prior
to experiments, everolimus was diluted in cell culture
medium. Cell growth experiments were carried out in the
presence of 1 – 1000 nM everolimus. Resistance towards
everolimus was induced by subjecting Caki-1, KTCTL-26,
or A498 cells with stepwise ascending concentrations from
1 nM up to 1 μM. The tumor cells were further exposed
to 1 μM everolimus twice weekly for over a year. Tumor
cells, resistant to everolimus, were designated Caki-1res,
KTCTL-26res, and A498res. Control cells, sensitive to
everolimus, were designated Caki-1par, KTCTL-26par,
and A498par. L-Sulforaphane was provided by Biomol,
Hamburg, Germany. Concentrations from 1.25 – 20 µM
SFN were applied to cell cultures to evaluate effects on
the growth of both everolimus- resistant and everolimussensitive tumor cells. Since 20 µM SFN showed the
greatest growth inhibitory effect, all further experiments
were carried out with 20 µM SFN. Controls remained
untreated. To evaluate toxic effects of everolimus and
SFN, cell viability was determined by trypan blue (Gibco/
Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany).

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed with everolimusresistant and -sensitive subconfluent RCC cultures. Tumor
cell populations were stained with propidium iodide using
a Cycle TEST PLUS DNA Reagent Kit (BD Pharmingen,
Heidelberg, Germany) and then subjected to flow cytometry
with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
10,000 events were collected from each sample. Data
acquisition was carried out using Cell-Quest software and
cell cycle distribution, calculated with ModFit software
(BD Biosciences). The number of gated cells in the G1-,
S-, or G2/M-phases was expressed as % of total cells.

Western blot analysis of cell cycle regulating
proteins

Apoptosis

To investigate cell cycle regulating proteins,
tumor cell lysates were applied to a 7% polyacrylamide
gel and electrophoresed for 90 min at 100 V. The lysis
buffer consisted of Tris-NaCl, 10% Tergitol, 0.25% Nadeoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml
leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4,

To detect apoptosis the expression of Annexin V/
propidium iodide (PI) was evaluated using the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Pharmingen,
Heidelberg, Germany). Tumor cells were washed twice
with PBS-buffer and then incubated with 5 μl of Annexin

Tumor cell chemotaxis

2 mM PMSF. Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (1 hr, 100 V). After blocking with non-fat dry
milk for 1 hr, the membranes were incubated overnight
with monoclonal antibodies directed against the following
cell cycle proteins (all from BD Biosciences): Cdk1
(IgG1, clone 1), phospho-Cdk1 (pY15; IgG1, clone 44),
Cdk2 (IgG2a, clone 55), phospho-Cdk2 (Thr160;
MerckMillipore, Darmstadt, Germany), cyclin A (IgG1,
clone 25), cyclin B (IgG1, clone 18), p19 (IgG1, clone
52/p19), p27 (IgG1, clone 57; all from BD Biosciences).
The following monoclonal antibodies were employed to
determine mTOR signaling: phospho-Akt (pAkt; clone
104A282, mouse IgG1, BD Biosciences), phospho-rictor
(pRictor; IgG, Thr1135, D30A3), phospho-raptor (IgG,
Ser792; both MerckMillipore). HRP-conjugated goatanti-mouse IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY,
USA; dilution 1:5000) served as the secondary antibody.
The membranes were briefly incubated with ECL detection
reagent (ECL™, Amersham/GE Healthcare, München,
Germany) to visualize the proteins and then analysed by
the Fusion FX7 system (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany).
β-actin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufenkirchen, Germany)
served as the internal control.

Serum-induced chemotactic movement was
investigated using six-well Transwell chambers (Greiner
Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) with 8-μm pores.
Caki-1 cells (0.5 × 106/ml) were placed in the upper
chamber in serum-free medium. The lower chamber
contained 10% serum. After 20-hour incubation, the upper
surface of the Transwell membrane was gently wiped with
a cotton swab to remove cells that had not migrated. Cells,
which had moved to the lower surface of the membrane,
were stained using hematoxylin and counted under a
microscope. Mean chemotaxis was calculated from five
different observation fields (5 × 0.25 mm2).

Integrin surface expression
Caki-1res and Caki-1par cells were detached from
their culture flasks by Accutase and washed in blocking
solution (PBS, 0.5% BSA). The cells were then incubated
for 60 minutes at 4°C with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the
following integrin subtypes: anti-α1 (mouse IgG1, clone
SR84), anti-α2 (mouse IgG2a, clone 12 F1-H6), anti-α3
(mouse IgG1, clone C3 II.1), anti-α4 (mouse IgG1, clone
9 F10), anti-α5 (mouse IgG1, clone IIA1), anti-α6 (rat
IgG2a, clone GoH3), anti-β1 (mouse IgG1, clone MAR4),
anti-β3 (mouse IgG1, clone VI-PL2), or anti-β4 (rat
IgG2a; clone 439–9B; all: BD Biosciences). Tumor cell
integrin expression was then measured using a FACScan
(BD Biosciences; FL-2H (log) channel histogram
analysis; 1 × 104 cells per scan) and expressed as mean
fluorescence units. A mouse IgG1-PE (MOPC-21) or
IgG2a-PE (G155–178; all: BD Biosciences) was used as
an isotype control.

RCC cell adhesion
To analyze Caki-1 adhesion, HUVECs were seeded
onto six-well multiplates (Falcon Primaria; BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) in complete HUVEC medium. When
confluency was reached, Caki-1 cells (everolimus-resistant
and -sensitive, SFN treated and non-treated controls) were
detached from their culture flasks by Accutase treatment
(PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany). Tumor cells (0.5 × 106)
were then added to the HUVEC monolayer for 30, 60, or
120 minutes. Subsequently, non-adherent cells were washed
off using warmed (37°C) M199. Adherent cells were fixed
with 1% glutaraldehyde and counted in five different fields,
each 0.25 mm2 , using a phase-contrast microscope. Mean
cellular adhesion in the five fields was calculated.

Blocking and knock-down studies
Caki-1 everolimus-resistant and –sensitive (parental)
cells were incubated for 60 minutes with 10 μg/ml
function-blocking anti–integrin α5 (clone P1D6), α6 (clone
NKI-GoH3) or β4 (clone ASC-8; all: MerckMillipore).
Control cells were incubated with cell culture medium
alone. Adhesion and chemotaxis were then evaluated as
previously described. In further experiments, Cakipar and
Cakires cells (3 × 105/well) were transfected with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against cdk1 (gene ID:
983, target sequence: AAGGGGTTCCTAGTACTGCAA;
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or cyclin B (gene ID: 891,
target sequence: AATGTAGTCATGGTAAATCAA;
Qiagen), with an siRNA/transfection reagent (HiPerFect
Transfection Reagent; Qiagen) ratio of 1:6. Non-treated
cells and cells treated with 5 nM control siRNA (All stars
negative control siRNA; Qiagen) served as controls.
Subsequently, tumor cell growth was analyzed as
previously described.

Attachment to a collagen matrix
Six-well plates (Falcon Primaria) were coated with
collagen G [extracted from calfskin, consisting of 90%
collagen type I and 10% collagen type III; diluted to
400 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Seromed,
Berlin, Germany] overnight. Plastic dishes served as the
background control. Plates were washed with 1% BSA
in PBS to block nonspecific cell adhesion. Caki-1 cells
(0.5 × 106) were then added to each well for 60 minutes.
Subsequently, non-adherent tumor cells were washed
off, and the remaining adherent cells were fixed with 1%
glutaraldehyde and counted under a microscope. Mean
cellular adhesion, defined by adherent cellscoated well −
adherent cellsbackground, was calculated from five different
observation fields (5 × 0.25 mm2).
