ABSTRACT
Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) II and I are major causes for drug-resistant
epilepsy. In order to gain insight into the possible correlations between FCD II
and FCD I, different clinical characteristics and immunohistochemical expression
characteristics in FCD I and II were analyzed. The median age of onset and duration
of epilepsy in FCD I and FCD II patients were 2.1 years and 5.3 years vs 2.4 years and
4.5 years. Therefore, the median age of onset and duration of epilepsy were similar
in the two groups. Pathological lesions were predominantly located in frontal lobe
in FCD II and temporal in FCD I. Significantly more signal abnormalities in FLAIR
and T2 images were demonstrated in FCD II than FCD I. The rate of satisfied seizure
outcome was relative higher in FCDII patients (95.12%) than that in FCDI group
(84.6%). Furthermore, we detected expressions of progenitor cell proteins and the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade activation protein in FCDs. Results
showed that sex-determiningregion Y-box 2(SOX2) , Kruppel-likefactor 4 (KLF4) and
phospho-S6 ribosomal proteins (ser240/244 or ser235/236) were expressed in FCDII
group but not in FCD I. Overall, this study unveils FCD I and II exhibit distinct clinical
and immunohistochemical expression characteristics, revealing different pathogenic
mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

mechanisms of FCDs would provide important insights
into earlier diagnosis and improved predictability of
surgical management.
The mTOR pathway is a canonical pathogenic
signaling pathway as well as a new potential target for
cortical lesions of FCD II and tuberous sclerosis complex
(TSC) [6-10]. Some phosphorylated downstream proteins
in mTOR pathway, such as ribosomal protein phospho
S6 (pS6), have been proved to be useful makers in these
diseases. Specifically, activation of mTOR pathway
results in enhanced expression of transcriptional activator
c-Myc [11, 12]. c-Myc is expression associated with
transcriptional regulation of certain stem cell markers,

FCDs represent a common cause for pediatric
epilepsy [1, 2]. FCD I is primarily characterized by
focal disruption of normal intracortical lamination and
columnar organization, while FCD II exhibits dramatic
laminar disorganization and particularly dysmorphic
neurons (DNs) and/or additional Balloon cells (BCs) [3,
4, 5]. Both FCD types are associated with intractable
epilepsy while display distinct histopathological and
clinical characteristics. The histopathological differences
between FCD I and FCD II suggest different mechanism
of clinical characteristics. Understanding molecular

such as SOX2 [13]. Furthermore, we also examined an
additional stem cell marker, the KLF4, which has recently
been shown to bind to SOX2 to regulate development
of embryonic stem cells. Thus, we hypothesize that
differential mTOR signaling proteins and progenitor cell
proteins (SOX2 and KLF4) would facilitate distinguishing
FCD II and FCD I.
This study aims to compare clinical, imaging
features and surgical outcomes between FCD I and
FCD II. Furthermore, activation of mTOR pathway and
expression of stem cell are also analyzed.

and the difference was statistically significant (χ2=10.64,
p < 0.01).

Pathological results
Gross specimen of FCD I patients appeared
normal (with clear boundaries of the cortex-white matter
junction). In cases of FCD II, coronal slices showed
increased thickness of the cortex (with blurry cortexwhite matter junction) (Figure 1). In FCD I samples, we
found architectural cortical dysplasia in cortex, which
presented as tangential dyslamination (Figure 2a) and
radial disorganization (Figure 2b). In some cases, it was
associated with hypertrophic pyramidal neurons outside
Layer 5. FCD II samples demonstrated pronounced
architectural cortical dysplasia and cytoarchitectural
disturbances, such as DNs (Figure 2c) and/or additional
BCs (Figure 2d).
We further analyzed mTOR signaling and progenitor
cell markers in fixed FCD I and FCD II specimens.
Expression of pS6, KLF4, and SOX2 were examined by
IHC. SOX2 (Figure.3a) and KLF4 expressions (Figure
3b) were detected in all FCD II specimens, which were
largely confined to DNs and BCs in FCD II. In contrast,
only minimal expression of SOX2 or KLF4 were detected
in sporadic FCD I specimens. For pS6, we utilized two
antibodies recognizing different phosphorylation sites of
pS6: ser240/244 and ser 235/236. We also examined pS6
(ser 235/236 and ser 240/244) expression in DNs and BCs
of FCD II (Figure 3c, 3d). More than 90% of BCs/DNs

RESULTS
Clinical results
The median age of onset and duration of epilepsy
in FCD I and FCD II patients were 2.1 years and 5.3
years vs 2.4 years and 4.5 years, respectively (Table 1).
About median age of onset and duration of epilepsy, no
significant difference was observed between two groups
(P < 0.05). All of the patients mainly suffered from
complex partial seizures and most of them had secondary
generalized seizures.
In FCD I patients, 13/26 patients had lesions in
temporal lobe and 8/26 patients had lesions in frontal lobe.
In FCD II patients, more than half of the cases (24/41,
58.53%) had epilepsy lesions in frontal lobe. Compared
to FCD I, FCD II was more likely to locate in frontal lobe

in FCD II specimens exhibited phosphorylated pS6 at ser
235/236 and ser 240/244 while in FCD I specimens, we
failed to detect this aberrant phosphorylation of pS6.
For double-labelled immunofluorescence, pS6 (ser
235/236) and SOX2 were double labelled and results
showed the co-labelling of some BCs/DNs (Figure 4a, 4b,
4c, 4d), although many small SOX2 positive cells were not
labelled. Double labelling of pS6 (ser235/236) and KLF4
showed the co-labelling of some BCs/DNs (Figure 4e, 4f,

junction were most frequently found in 40/41 (97.56%)
FCD II patients. Thirty-nine/41 (95.12%) cases with FCD
II had low signals on T1 but high signals on T2 (Figure 5a)
and FLAIR (Figure 5b). For FCD I patients, MRI in 14/26
(53.84%) cases merely showed meager mixed hyperintensity on T2 and mixed hyper-intensity on FLAIR
signals.

Surgical outcomes
The mean duration of follow-up was 3 years.
Postsurgical follow-ups in FCD I cases found that 22 cases
had good outcomes and 4 cases had poor outcomes. The
prognostic rate of FCD I was 84.6%. In the postsurgical
investigation, 39 FCD II patients were found with good
prognosis, accounting for 95.12% and 2 patients had poor
outcomes. Although the prognostic rate in FCD II was
higher than FCD I group, no statistical significance was
found between them (χ2 =0.006, P > 0.05).

DISCUSSION

fixation and type of antigen retrieval methods used [26]. In
addition to these, possible reasons also included the lesser
samples on clinical cases and an unclear designation of
FCD I or FCD II cases under the condition of lacking BCs
or DNs.
In addition, it is known that mTOR impacts on
normal stem cell development and proliferation [27, 28].
SOX2 was the marker for multipotent neural stem cells,
and KLF4 was typically identified in pluripotent stem cells
[29]. One report revealed that expression of some early
progenitor cell proteins was detected in BCs in sporadic
FCD type II specimens. In contrast, there was minimal
expression of early progenitor cell markers in type I FCD
specimens [25]. In this study, we demonstrate that the
expression of SOX2 and KLF4 proteins was found in
FCD II but not in FCD I. The expression of SOX2 and
KLF4 proteins distinguishes type II FCD from type I
FCD. Thus, these results suggest that BCs/DNs exhibit
a protein expression phenotype similar to multipotent or
pluripotent stem cells, which is consistent with previous
report [25]. We also detected co-expression of pS6 (ser
240/244, ser 235/236) and early progenitor cell markers
(SOX2 and KLF4) on BCs/DNs in type II FCD, which
could highlight that hyperactive mTOR signaling maybe
linked to a progenitor cell. A clear designation of type I
or type II FCD may pose a challenge, especially in the
absence of BCs or DNs.
In our studies, we found a trend towards a better
surgical outcome in FCD II patients than FCD I, which
may be explained by the absence of an MRI-detectable
lesion in FCD I and improved total removal rate in FCD
II. Besides, the distinction between type I and type II FCD
based on both histology and signal cascade activation
(mTOR signaling proteins and early progenitor cell
markers) may also help to stratify patients and identify
FCD types with greater accuracy.

The study revealed significant differences
between FCD II and FCD I with respect to clinical,
immunohistochemical and outcome features.
For clinical features, half (13/26) of the FCD I cases
had lesions in the temporal lobe and 58.53% of FCD II
cases (24/41) having lesions in frontal lobe. FCD I and II
had significantly different locations, which may manifest
different clinical features between them.
The MRI finding of FCD II includes increased
cortical thickness, blurring of the gray-white matter
junction, T2 and Flair hyperintensity on lesions [15-18].
The most sensitive MRI parameters for FCD II were
cortical thickening and blurry gray/white matter junction
(97.56%) and the relatively lower changes include high
signals on T2 and Flair images in this study (95.12%).
MRI features of FCDII may provide enough information
about the location of lesion and regular EEG criteria was
used for further localization, which could enable complete
resection. In contrast to FCD II, MRI diagnostics of FCD
I is more challenging. Colombo et al [19] and Tassi et al
[20] reported MRI changes in FCD I including milder
forms of abnormal signals. Of our 26 FCDI patients,
14(53.84%) had very meager signal changes and mixed
hyper-intensity on Flair and T2 signals, and 12 had normal
MRI. Most FCD I cases need further intracranial recording
in pre-surgical evaluation.
As to surgical outcome, the prognostic rates in
FCD II and FCD I were 95.12% and 84.6 %, respectively.
Prognostic rates of FCD II subjects were reported for 72%91% [17, 21]. Widdess-Walsh et al [18] reported 61% of
FCD Ia and 38% of FCD Ib subjects had Engel I outcome.
More seizure-free patients were significantly found in
FCD II than FCD I [17, 18, 21]. Although the outcomes of
cases with FCD I and FCD II are slightly better than those
previously reported, it tends to that FCD I has obviously
poorer outcomes. In contrast to FCD I, FCD II has more
obvious features, whether pathology or imaging. Both of
them could benefit from complete resection.
Except for BCs/DNs, more molecular pathogenesis
of FCD I and II remains to be elucidated. However, recent
molecular-genetic and histopathologic studies indicate
involvement of mTOR activation pathway in FCD II
[22, 23]. These findings show that mTOR is activated in
FCD II but not in FCD I [22-25]. More than 90% of BCs/
DNs in FCD II cases exhibited pS6 (ser 235/236 and ser
240/244), which is consistent with previous report [22-25].
S6 protein phosphorylation (ser 235/236 and ser 240/244)
was not detected in FCD I cases in this study. However,
a recent study has reported the expressions of mTOR
cascade activation protein was also found in some FCD I
cases [26]. They thought the reasons for this discrepancy
may be related to variability in the levels of mTOR
cascade activation protein in FCD I as well as differences
in the type of antibodies, staining techniques, duration of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population
FCD I and FCD II samples were obtained from 67
patients and clinical features were summarized in Table 1.
All patients underwent epilepsy surgery at the Sanbo Brain
Hospital, Capital Medical University. Patients with TSC,
benign brain tumors, polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia,
Sturge-Weber syndrome, and hemimegalencephaly were
excluded. All enrolled patients were divided into two
groups (FCDI and FCD II) based on the histological
classification system proposed by the current International
League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifications [14].
Comparison was performed between the two groups

refers to cases with invalid and/or aggravated effects.

Preoperative evaluation

Statistical analysis

All patients underwent comprehensive preoperative
evaluations including a review of the neuropsychological
evaluation and seizure history. Presumed location of the
epileptogenic zone was identified during the presurgical
evaluation (EEG, MRI, T1-weighted, T2-weighted and
FLAIR images and PET). Result of the surface EEG for
localization of epileptogenic zone was obtained from
epilepsy monitoring unit. Surface video-EEG recordings
were performed for all of the patients. Invasive EEG
with subdural or depth electrodes were recorded in 28/67
patients in whom epileptogenic zones were not detected by
surface EEG nor MRI.

Data were analyzed by Statistical Package for Social
Sciences version 13.0 software. Statistical significance was
examined by use of Student’s t test, χ2 and Fisher’s exact
test. P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.

Histological findings and classification

This work was supported by the Joint Fund for
basic and clinical research cooperation project of Capital
Medical University (Grant No. 15JL89) and the Beijing
Municipal Science& Technology Commission(Grant No.
Z 131107002213012).

Resected specimens were examined macroscopically
and photographed. The specimens were fixed in 10 %
neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
processed routinely. Exprssions of SOX2 (DAKO GmbH,
Germany), KLF4 (DAKO GmbH, Germany), antiphospho-S6ser240/244 (Cell Signaling Technology) and
anti-phospho-S6ser235/236 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were detected. Malformations of cortical development
were graded according to the classification system
outlined by ILAE [14]. For double-labelled immune
fluorescence, a similar protocol was applied in a primary
antibody solution containing anti-phospho-S6 Ribosomal
proteins (ser240/244 or ser235/236), with SOX2 or KLF4
overnight at 4°C. Sections were thoroughly washed using
phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and the fluorescein-labelled
antibody was incubated for 45 minutes on the following
day. After PBS washings, sections were cover slipped
using DAPI mounting medium. The cellular staining and
distribution were assessed qualitatively using bright field
(Leica), epifluorescence (Leica DM4000-6000 Brilliant),
and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopes
(Olympus BX53).
