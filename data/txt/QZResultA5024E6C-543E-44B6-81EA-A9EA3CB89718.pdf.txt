Abstract
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), also known as islet cell tumors, exhibit a wide range of biologic
behaviors ranging from long dormancy to rapid progression. Currently, there are few molecular biomarkers that
can be used to predict recurrence/metastasis or response to therapy. This study examined the predictive and
prognostic value of a single nucleotide polymorphism substituting an arginine (R) for glycine (G) in codon 388 of
the FGFR4 transmembrane domain. We established the FGFR4 genotype of 71 patients with pNETs and
correlated genotype with biologic behavior. We created an in vivo model of pNET with BON1 cells and transfected
them with either FGFR4-G388 or FGFR4-R388 to determine the mechanism of action and to examine response to
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. We then validated the predictive results of experimental studies in a group of
patients treated with everolimus. FGFR4-R388 is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior in patients
with pNETs with a statistically signiﬁcant higher risk of advanced tumor stage and liver metastasis. Using an
orthotopic mouse xenograft model, we show that FGFR4-R388 promotes tumor progression by increasing
intraperitoneal spread and metastatic growth within the liver. Unlike FGFR4-G388, FGFR4-R388 BON1 tumors
exhibited diminished responsiveness to everolimus. Concordantly, there was a statistically signiﬁcant reduction
in response to everolimus in patients with FGFR4-R388. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of the FGFR4 allele
in pNET progression and identify a predictive marker of potential therapeutic importance in this disease.

Introduction
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are transmembrane kinases involved in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and
wound healing. Four genes encode a number of receptor
isoforms of FGFR-1, -2, -3, and -4 (1). The FGFR family has a
highly conserved structure: an extracellular ligand-binding
domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracytoplasmic
domain with tyrosine kinase activity (2, 3). Germline FGFR
mutations are implicated in developmental defects such as
skeletal dysplasias and craniosynostotic syndromes (4). FGFR
translocations (5) and somatic mutations (6, 7) have been
identiﬁed in malignancies and ampliﬁcation of FGFR4 has
been reported in breast and gynecologic cancers (8).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are the most common genetic variations, representing 90% of sequence differences with an overall frequency of about 1 per 1,000 bases. A
polymorphism in FGFR4 (9) characterized by conversion of
guanine to adenine at position 1,217 in exon 9 results in the
substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 388 in the transmembrane domain; 40% to 50% of Caucasians carry at least one
copy of this allele. The FGFR4-R388 allele is associated with
poor outcomes in cohorts of sarcoma (10), prostate (11), lung
(12, 13), and head and neck carcinomas (14) and in those with
advanced and treatment-resistant breast cancer (15). The
corresponding mouse SNP accelerates breast cancer progression (16). The mechanisms by which this FGFR4 variant
promotes enhanced oncogenesis remain unclear.
FGFR4 interaction with N-cadherin, an adhesion molecule
implicated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) invasion
and metastasis, results in downstream activation of PLC-g, PI3K,
and MAPK, thereby promoting cell survival, migration, and invasion (17, 18). In this report, we examine the impact of the FGFR4G388R SNP on pNET progression and response to therapy.

WHO classiﬁcation (19) were included; poorly differentiated
neuroendocrine carcinomas, G3, were excluded. Patients
enrolled in a clinical trial of everolimus (20) were examined
for correlations between genotype and response.
Genotyping
DNA was isolated from normal somatic tissue or blood using
proteinase K digestion and phenol–chloroform extraction.
FGFR4 polymorphisms were ampliﬁed by PCR as described
(9) and sequenced.
Cell lines and cultures
Human pancreatic BON1 cells propagated in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.)
with high glucose, 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 IU/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin were serum-starved
overnight and treated with FGF-1 (25 ng/mL) or insulin (300
nmol/L) for 15 minutes. The cells were treated with everolimus
(10–40 nmol/L; LC laboratories).
Plasmid construction and transfection
Plasmids containing coding regions of human FGFR4-G388
or FGFR4-R388 were stably transfected into the pcDNA3.1
expression vector (Invitrogen; ref. 18). Three clones of cells
expressing each isoform or transfected with empty vector were
selected for analyses.
Western blotting
Equal amounts of protein separated by 8% SDS-PAGE were
transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore). Blots were incubated with polyclonal antiserum
against FGFR4 (Santa Cruz) or monoclonal antibody to the V5tag (Invitrogen), N-cadherin (BD Tranduction Laboratories),
STAT3, p-STAT3, AKT, and pS473-AKT (Cell Signaling). Actin
(1:500, Sigma) was a loading control. Nonspeciﬁc binding was
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 1 Tris-buffered saline (TBST
with 0.1% Tween-20). After washing 3  10 minutes in 1
TBST, blots were exposed to secondary antibody (antimouse or
rabbit IgG-HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:2,000 and
visualized using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham).
In vivo tumor growth assay
Female severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID)
mice 6 to 7 weeks old were maintained under pathogen-free
conditions. For each experiment, 15 mice representing 3
groups (FGFR4-G388, FGFR4-R388, or controls) were injected
with 5  106 cells. In the subcutaneous model, tumors were
measured using vernier calipers (Fisher Scientiﬁc Ltd.). In the
orthotopic model, imaging with Micro-CT was conducted to
assess tumor growth. For mTOR inhibition, everolimus was
administered 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice weekly.
Following institutional guidelines for ethical care of animals,
experiments ended when tumor volumes exceeded 100 mm3,
typically 30 days after implantation. Tumor volumes were
calculated as (length  width  depth)/2. Tumors were
weighed at autopsy; in the orthotopic model, intraperitoneal
dissemination, diaphragmatic and organ involvement, and
hemoperitoneun were recorded. Tumor tissue, liver, and lungs

were ﬁxed in formalin, and portions of tumors were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70 C.
Morphology and immunohistochemistry
Sections of formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or used for immunohistochemical localization with the avidin–biotin complex technique. Immunostaining was conducted in parafﬁn sections
incubated with primary antibodies to various hormones, Ncadherin (BD Tranduction Laboratories, Clone 32, 610921) and
Ki67 (MIB-1 polyclonal, Novus Biological NB110-90592). Apoptosis was detected in parafﬁn sections using the terminal
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique.
Statistical analysis
Baseline demographics and characteristics of the study
participants were examined using univariate analyses. Data
are presented as mean  SD. In experimental models, differences were assessed using independent, 2-sided t tests. Analysis of surgical human tumor specimens applied Fisher exact
test. Correlational analyses were used to examine relationships
among variables. Multiple logistic regression was then used to
identify which variables were associated with the development
of liver metastases. Analyses were conducted using SPSS
version 19 (SPSS Inc.). All differences were deemed to be
signiﬁcant at P  0.05. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier
method, and the log-rank test was used to compare the
difference between patient or genotype groups. The hazard
ratio (HR) between 2 groups was estimated by proportional
hazards regression with a 95% Wald conﬁdence interval (95%
CI). Data analysis was done with SAS version 9.2, and all P
values were 2 sided.

Results
Primary human pNETs
Clinicopathologic features. The 71 patients (Supplementary Table S1), 31 men (43.7%) and 40 women, ranged from 23
to 80 (mean 52.3) years of age. Tumors measured 0.8 to 11.0 cm;
20 were 2 cm or less. Eight patients had multiple tumors and
familial cancer syndromes; 7 had multiple endocrine neoplasia
type I (MEN-I) and 1 had von Hippel–Lindau disease. Ten
patients had clinical evidence of hormone hypersecretion; all
were insulinomas (Supplementary Table S1).
Immunohistochemistry identiﬁed insulin in 25 tumors; only
10 were clinical insulinomas. Glucagon was found in 13, 9
expressed gastrin, 8 serotonin, and 7 vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP). Twenty-two expressed 2 or more hormones and
14 were negative for hormones. The mitotic rate was 0 to 12/10
high power ﬁelds (HPF). Twelve had greater than 2 mitoses/10
HPF. The Ki-67 labeling index ranged from less than 1% to 20%;
18 were greater than 2%. Twenty-one tumors exhibited local
invasion into peripancreatic fat; 32 displayed angioinvasion.
Seventeen had lymph node metastases, and 12 had liver
metastases.
Genetic analysis. Genotyping showed that 35 (49.3%)
patients were homozygous for FGFR4-G388, 30 (42.3%) were
heterozygous, and 6 (8.5%) were homozygous for FGFR4-R388.

FGFR4 in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

Genotype and hormone expression. Although there was
no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between genotype and
hormone production (Table 1), among clinical insulinomas, 7
(70%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, whereas only 3 (30%)
had an FGFR4-R388 allele. Among 13 tumors that expressed
glucagon, 9 (69%) were FGFR4-G388 homozygous, whereas 4
(31%) carried an FGFR4-R388 allele. Nine tumors expressed
gastrin; 5 (56%) were FGFR4-G388 homozygous and 4 (44%)
had an FGFR4-R388 allele. Eight tumors expressed serotonin; 5
(63%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388 and 3 (37%) had an
FGFR4-R388 allele. Seven tumors were positive for VIP; only
2 (29%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, whereas 5 (71%) had
an FGFR4-R388 allele.
Genotype and N-cadherin expression. To determine if
FGFR4 genotype altered N-cadherin expression in these
tumors, we conducted immunohistochemistry for N-Cadherin
in 69 cases where remaining tissue was available. Of the 40
positive cases, 23 (58%) carried an FGFR4-R388 allele, whereas

42% were homozygous FGFR4-G388. N-Cadherin expression
was cytoplasmic in the majority of cases studied. Only 4 cases,
3 homozygous FGFR4-G388, and 1 homozygous FGFR4-R388
showed a membranous staining pattern. There was no significant correlation between FGFR4 genotype and N-Cadherin
expression.
Genotype and tumor aggressiveness. Tumor size was
unknown in 6 cases. Of 20 tumors less than 2 cm, 11 (55%)
were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 6 (30.0%) were heterozygous,
and 3 (15.0%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388. In contrast, of 45
tumors 2 cm, 21 (47%) were heterozygous, whereas 3 (6%)
were homozygous for FGFR4-R388 and 21 (47%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388. Interestingly, 55.0% of patients with
pNETS less than 2 cm were homozygous FGFR4-G388, whereas
53% of patients with pNETs 2 cm had an FGFR4-R388 allele
(Table 1).
Mitotic count was unknown in one case. Of 20 pNETs with 2
to 20/10 HPF, 9 (45%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 10 (50%)

(7%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388. Although not statistically
signiﬁcant due to small numbers, it is notable that the FGFR4R388 allele, which is usually present in less than 50% of the
population, was present in 11 of 17 (65%) patients who
developed lymph node metastasis.
Of 12 pNETs with liver metastasis, 8 were heterozygous
FGFR4-R388 and 2 were homozygous; only 2 were homozygous
FGFR4-G388. Of 59 patients that had no liver metastasis, 33
were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 5 were homozygous FGFR4R388; the remainder were heterozygous. Most importantly, the
FGFR4-R388 allele was present in 83% of the pNETs with liver
metastasis. This was statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.013).
Tumor stage was unknown in 2 cases. Of the patients with
stage I and II disease, 19 (53%) and 13 (62%) were homozygous
FGFR4-G388, respectively, and 17 (47%) and 8 (38%) had an
FGFR4-R388 allele. No patient had stage III disease. Of the 12
patients with stage IV disease, 2 were homozygous FGFR4R388, 8 were heterozygous, and 2 were homozygous FGFR4G388. Therefore, the FGFR4-R388 allele was present in 83% (10/
12) of the stage IV pNETs, reaching statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼
0.036).
Risk of liver metastases. In our series, the probability of
developing liver metastases was 16.9% (12/71). The percentage
of patients who developed liver metastases with an FGFR4R388 allele was 27.8% (10/36) compared with 5.7% (2/35) for
FGFR4-G388 homozygotes (Table 2). The estimated risk of
developing liver metastases in FGFR4-R388 carriers compared
with FGFR4-G388 was 6.3 (95%CI: 1.3–31.5; Table 2). Regression analysis conﬁrmed the value of FGFR4-R388 as a predictive marker for liver metastases. Multiple logistic regression
revealed a statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001) 3-variable model
including lymphovascular invasion (OR 13.8, 95%CI: 1.5–128.0),
presence of lymph nodes metastases (OR 5.0, 95%CI: 1.0–24.8),
and FGFR4 genotype (homozygous or heterozygous FGFR4R388 vs. FGFR4-G388 OR 5.7, 95%CI: 0.9–34.7) that was associated with the development of liver metastasis.

were heterozygous, and 1 (5%) was homozygous FGFR4-R388.
Of 50 patients whose pNETs had less than 2 mitoses/10 HPF, 26
(52%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 19 were heterozygous,
and 5 were homozygous FGFR4-R388; 24 (48%) had an R388
allele.
The MIB-1 labeling index was unknown in 9 cases. Among
patients with tumor MIB-1 2% to 20%, 8 (44%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 8 were heterozygous, and 2 were homozygous FGFR4-R388; 56% harbored an R388 allele. Of 44 patients
with tumor MIB-1 less than equal to 2%, 22 (50%) were
homozygous FGFR4-G388, 18 (41%) were heterozygous, and
4 (9%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388.
Tumor grade. Tumors were divided according to the 2010
WHO into Grade 1 (G1) and Grade 2 (G2); no poorly differentiated Grade 3 (G3) tumors were included in this study. The
grade of 1 tumor was not known. Among patients with G2
tumors, 12 (44%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 13 (48%)
were heterozygous, and 2 were homozygous FGFR4-R388; 56%
harbored an R388 allele. Of the 43 patients with G1 tumors, 23
(54%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 16 (37%) were heterozygous, and 4 (9%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388.
The status of local invasion was unclear in one case. Fortynine patients had tumors conﬁned to pancreas; 25 (51%) were
homozygous FGFR4-G388, 21 (43%) heterozygous, and 3 (6%)
homozygous FGFR4-R388. Of 21 patients with locally invasive
pNETs, 10 (48%) were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 8 (38%) were
heterozygous, and 3 (14%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388.
Lymphovascular invasion was unknown in one case. Of 32
patients with lymphovascular invasion, 15 (47%) were FGFR4G388 homozygotes, 14 (48%) heterozygotes, and 3 (9%) were
FGFR4-R388 homozygotes. In contrast, of 38 patients with
nonangioinvasive pNETs, 20 (53%) were FGFR4-G388 homozygotes, 15 (39%) heterozygotes, and 3 (8%) were FGFR4-R388
homozygotes. Therefore, 53% of angioinvasive pNETs were in
FGFR4-R388 carriers, whereas 53% of nonangioinvasive pNETs
were from FGFR4-G388 homozygotes.
Of 17 patients with lymph node involvement, only 6 (35%)
were homozygous FGFR4-G388, whereas 9 (53%) were heterozygous and 2 (12%) were homozygous FGFR4-R388. In contrast, of 53 patients without lymph node involvement, 29 (55%)
were homozygous FGFR4-G388, 20 (38%) heterozygous, and 4

FGFR4 in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

In the subcutaneous ﬂank model, the median tumor burden
was signiﬁcantly higher in FGFR4-R388 than in FGFR4-G388
tumors (952 vs. 688 mm3; P ¼ 0.05) or control tumors (median
603 mm3; P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 1A). Tumor weights were signiﬁcantly
greater in FGFR4-R388 compared with FGFR4-G388 tumors
(Fig. 1B).
The orthotopic model recapitulated the human disease with
tumor nodules in pancreas and peripancreatic tissue and
spread into mesentery (Fig. 1C and D). Bloody ascites developed exclusively in 5/16 (31.2%) FGFR4-R388 tumors (P ¼
0.001). Tumor deposits on the abdominal surface of the diaphragm developed in 6/16 (37.5%) FGFR4-R388 tumors, 2/18
(11%) control tumors, and in no FGFR4-G388 tumors (P ¼
0.006). Lung metastases developed in 3/16 (18.7%) FGFR4-R388
tumors and 2/18 (11%) controls, but not in FGFR4-G388
tumors, yielding a statistically signiﬁcant difference between
FGFR4-R388 and FGFR4-G388 tumors (P ¼ 0.034). Liver metastases were signiﬁcantly more frequent with FGFR4-R388
tumors (5/16, 31.2%) compared with FGFR4-G388 (1/20, 5%;
P ¼ 0.019). Liver metastases developed in 2/18 (11%) controls.

The median weight of intraperitoneal metastases was signiﬁcantly higher in FGFR4-R388 tumors compared with
FGFR4-G388 and control tumors (1.37, 0.81, and 0.70 g, respectively; P ¼ 0.017; Fig. 1E). Primary tumor weights were also
heavier in FGFR4-R388 compared with FGFR4-G388 tumors
(0.67 vs. 0.43g; P ¼ 0.05) but were not statistically greater than
controls (0.59 g).
In all experiments, histology conﬁrmed the presence of
tumor nodules composed of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei with "salt and pepper"
chromatin, arranged in nests and sheets. The neoplastic cells
were positive for chromogranin, validating the model of neuroendocrine carcinoma. There was no morphologic difference
between tumors of different genotypes. The Ki67 labeling index
was 60% to 70% and there were 32 to 58 mitoses per 10 HPF,
however, it is difﬁcult to compare these parameters in a cell
line model with the primary human tumor situation. There was
no signiﬁcant difference in Ki67 labeling index, apoptosis as
detected by TUNEL, or N-cadherin expression by Western
blotting or immunohistochemistry associated with genotype.

Figure 1. The FGFR4 SNP alters pNET progression in mouse xenografts. A and B, human pancreatic neuroendocrine BON1 cells stably expressing the
FGFR4-G388, the polymorphic form of the receptor FGFR4-R388, or their empty vector (pcDNA) control were examined in ﬂank xenografted SCID mice as
detailed in Materials and Methods. Data represent the mean of 2 independent experiments, each including 5 mice per group. A, statistically signiﬁcant
differences (P ¼ 0.05) in tumor volumes are identiﬁed. B, corresponding changes in tumor weights measured at the time of sacriﬁcing show a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the FGFR4-R388 group. C–E, pancreatic neuroendocrine BON1 cells as described in A and B were introduced orthotopically into the
peritoneal cavity of SCID mice. This orthotopic model results in pancreatic tumors (top arrow; C) with peritoneal spread (bottom arrow; C) and liver
metastases (arrows; D). The tumor weights (E) expressed as means of measurements obtained from 2 independent experiments, each with 5 mice in each
group identify statistically signiﬁcant differences in tumor weight (P < 0.05) based on FGFR4 genotype.

Figure 2. Comparison of signaling
potential of BON1 cells expressing
different FGFR4 isoforms. BON1
cells expressing FGFR4-G388 or
FGFR4-R388 were treated with the
indicated doses of the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus for 24 hours as
detailed in Materials and Methods.
Total cell lysates were resolved on
8% SDS gels and transferred to
membranes for hybridization with

treated cells. Unlike FGFR4-G388
cells, FGFR4-R388 cells show
minimal to no inhibition of mTOR
phosphorylation.

Response to everolimus
The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promise for
patients with progressive pNETs (20, 21). We tested BON1
cells to determine responsiveness to this drug in the context
of different FGFR4 genotypes. BON1 FGFR4-G388 cells displayed the anticipated inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation
in response to everolimus (Fig. 3). Consistent with reduced
mTOR-mediated negative feedback inhibition, pAKT levels
increased in response to everolimus. In contrast, FGFR4R388 cells displayed relative resistance with persistently
higher pmTOR levels despite drug treatment (Fig. 2). In
addition, FGFR4-R388 cells revealed higher pSTAT3 levels
that were also unaffected by everolimus.
To determine the biologic signiﬁcance of these in vitro
signaling differences, we tested the mTOR inhibitor in BON1
mouse xenografts. Treatment was initiated 2 weeks after
inoculation when tumors measured 5 mm in diameter and
continued for 30 days. At complete autopsy, no toxic changes
attributable to everolimus were observed.
Although all mice developed tumors, everolimus signiﬁcantly
delayed growth and progression of FGFR4-G388 tumors (Fig.
3A) consistent with its recognized clinical use (20). However, no
discernible effect of the drug was observed in FGFR4-R388
tumors (Fig. 3B). Median tumor burden was signiﬁcantly
reduced to 46% volume and 70% weight in control xenografts
(P ¼ 0.014) and 54% volume and 58% weight in FGFR4-G388
xenografts (P ¼ 0.05). In contrast, median tumor burden was
the same in untreated and drug-treated FGFR4-R388 xenografts
(Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis of tumor lysates from drugtreated animals conﬁrmed effective mTOR-phosphorylation
inhibition in FGFR4-G388 but not FGFR4-R388 tumors (Fig.
3C). As documented in vitro, pSTAT3 levels were unaffected by
everolimus treatment in vivo. There was no signiﬁcant difference in Ki67 labeling index, apoptosis as detected by TUNEL, or
N-cadherin expression between controls and treated tumors.

To validate the data suggesting a predictive value of the
FGFR4 SNP in humans, we genotyped 17 patients with pNETs
who had been included in a previous clinical trial of everolimus
in G1 and G2 NETs and had consented to genotyping analysis
(20). All patients had stage IV disease. In this group, 11 (65%)
were homozygous for FGFR4-G388 and 6 (35%) carried an
FGFR4-R388 allele. Of the 11 with FGFR4-G388, 7 patients had
G1 tumors, 3 had G2 tumors, and 1 was of unknown grade, asthe
diagnosis was based on cytology alone. Among the 6 with an
FGFR4-R388 allele, 5 had a tumor graded as G1 and 1 had a G2
tumor. In an assessment of best-percentage change in RECIST
tumor measurements (sum of target lesion diameters; Fig. 4A),
greater reductions were observed among patients homozygous
for FGFR4-G388 (mean percentage change, 25% vs. 9%; P ¼
0.049). However, due to the small sample size, the difference in
partial response rate (17% vs. 27%) was not signiﬁcant. Overall,
median PFS among everolimus-treated patients was 14.3
(95%CI: 7.1–21.4) months. When separated by genotype,
patients homozygous for FGFR4-G388 had a median PFS of
16.6 (95%CI: 10.8–22.3) months, whereas those harboring an
FGFR4-R388 allele had a median of 4.8 (95%CI: NA – 10.2)
months (Fig. 4B, P ¼ 0.40). Median OS was 27.4 (95%CI: 7.2–
47.6) months. When separated by genotype, patients homozygous for FGFR4-G388 had a median OS of 40 (95%CI: 19.5–60.5)
months, whereas those harboring an FGFR4-R388 allele had a
median OS of 9.3 (95%CI: NA–21.9) months (Fig. 4C, P ¼ 0.54).

Discussion
Germline SNPs in coding regions have a frequency greater
than 1%. Nearly half of coding SNPs cause missense mutations
in corresponding proteins (22, 23). Missense SNPs may be
neutral or may alter protein stability, folding, ligand binding,
catalysis, regulation by allosteric mechanisms, or posttranslational modiﬁcations (24). SNPs may result in differences in

We show that the FGFR4-G388R polymorphism signiﬁcantly
modiﬁes pNET behavior: pNETs with an FGFR4-R388 allele are
more commonly identiﬁed in patients with larger tumors that
have local invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph nodal
metastases. Moreover, FGFR4-R388 is signiﬁcantly associated
with liver metastases, a critical prognostic feature of this
disease. The small sample size of this relatively rare tumor
may have reduced the power to detect more statistically
signiﬁcant effects of this SNP.

The biologic impact of the FGFR4 SNP was validated in
experimental mouse models including an orthotopic model
that recapitulates the progression of human pNETs. Human
BON1 cells were selected because of their relatively unique
derivation from a human pNET. Xenografts expressing FGFR4R388 behaved in a more aggressive fashion: they were significantly larger by size and weight and exhibited greater intraperitoneal growth in the orthotopic model. Bloody ascites were
noted exclusively in FGFR4-R388 tumors. Liver and lung
metastases and diaphragmatic involvement were signiﬁcantly
more frequent in FGFR4-R388 tumors.

Our data indicate that the changes in tumor behavior
associated with this SNP are not mediated by changes in Ncadherin. While interactions with N-cadherin have been
described with FGFR4 in pancreatic endocrine cells (17) and
alterations in the extracellular domain of FGFR4 alter Ncadherin in pituitary tumors (18), the SNP that we examined
here alters the transmembrane domain of FGFR4. We have
recently shown that FGFR4-R388 tumors show persistently
higher STAT3 phosphorylation (25), a feature that is a recognized mechanism of promoting tumor progression.
Everolimus (rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic) exhibits
potent antifungal and immunosuppressive activities by inhibiting the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate p70S6K and 4EBP1, thereby inhibiting cell-cycle progression by reducing
translation of several cell-cycle proteins including cyclin D1
and c-myc. This drug has been used successfully in the treatment of neuroendocrine carcinomas (20, 21, 26). This agent
inhibited mTOR phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, causing
effective tumor suppression in FGFR4-G388 tumors. In contrast, FGFR4-R388 tumors showed persistently higher STAT3
phosphorylation despite treatment. Consistent with the wellrecognized impact of STAT3 in tumor progression, persistently
elevated levels of this protein in FGFR4-R388 tumors likely
served to evade tumor shrinkage. These ﬁndings were tested in
a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in a previously
reported clinical trial of everolimus (20). Although the numbers
of patients available for analysis are small, differences in bestpercentage tumor shrinkage suggest the FGFR4 genotype
maybe predictive of the degree of beneﬁt for pNET patients
treated with everolimus. While the PFS and OS survival analyses were not statistically signiﬁcant likely due to the small
number of events, they are supportive of the prognostic role of
FGFR4 genotype. Validation in a larger controlled study is
needed to deﬁne the clinical use of FGFR4 genotyping.

In summary, our data show that the FGFR4-G388R polymorphism plays an important role in pNET progression and
clinical aggressiveness. Further, our data indicate that the
FGFR4-R388 allele encodes a receptor with distinct signaling
properties that evade mTOR inhibition, providing a rational
tool to predict the effectiveness of medical therapy for patients
with neuroendocrine carcinomas.
