BACKGROUND. Growth factor overexpression, including epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) expression, is common in hepatocellular cancers. Erlotinib is a
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with specificity for EGFR. The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients treated with erlotinib who were alive and progression-free (PFS)
at 16 weeks of continuous treatment.
METHODS. Patients with unresectable HCC, no prior systemic therapy, performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2, and Childs-Pugh (CP) cirrhosis A or B received oral
erlotinib 150 mg daily for 28-day cycles. Tumor response was assessed every 2
cycles by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; National

Patients accrued to either ‘‘low’’ or ‘‘high’’ EGFR expression cohorts; each cohort
had stopping rules applied when there was a lack of efficacy.

40% PS 0, 55% PS 1, Childs-Pugh distribution was 75% A and 20% B. There were
ease at 16 weeks of continuous therapy. The PFS at 16 weeks was 43%, and the
median overall survival (OS) was 43 weeks (10.75 months). No patients required
outcome was found.

CONCLUSIONS. Results of this study indicated that single-agent erlotinib is well
tolerated and has modest disease-control benefit in HCC, manifested as modestly
prolonged PFS and OS when compared with historical controls. Cancer

epatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common solid
tumor worldwide, primarily because of underlying hepatic cirrhosis.1,2 The major etiologies of cirrhosis are diverse and include
hepatitis B virus-related liver disease (HBV), prevalent in parts of
Asia and Africa, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in North America, Western Europe and Japan; alcohol consumption; steatosis; diabetes;
liver injury in response to certain medications or toxins; and genetic
metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis. There is increasing
concern about the global epidemic of obesity as a risk factor for
numerous diseases, and obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for developing HCC.3,4 The mechanisms by which
these varied etiologies lead to cirrhosis and HCC are not yet fully
understood, although a common pathway may involve chronic

inflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a
procarcinogenic condition.5,6
Significant advances have been made in treatment of patients with small, localized HCC through
improved selection of patients for liver transplantation and surgery and demonstration of modest survival benefit from locoregional treatments. However,
>70% of all patients diagnosed with HCC have
advanced disease and are not candidates for these
therapies.7,8 Cytotoxic chemotherapy is minimally
effective in HCC, can have significant toxicity,9 particularly in the setting of liver dysfunction, and has
not appreciably improved patient survival.9–12 Developing effective systemic therapies for these patients
with advanced HCC clearly represents a significant
unmet medical need in oncology.
Growth factors and their receptors are known to
play a role in development and progression of
numerous tumors including HCC.13–15 Epidermal
growth factor (EGF) exhibits mitogenic activity in
vivo in numerous cell types including hepatocytes.16,17 Overexpression of EGF receptor (EGFR) is
common in chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
HCC.18 The known EGFR ligands, including EGF,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth
factor (TGFb), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF),
are mitogenic for hepatocytes and have been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.19 The expression of
several EGF family members, specifically EGF, TGFa
and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF, as well as the EGF receptor, has been described in several HCC cell lines
and in dysplastic nodules (DN), a precursor lesion to
HCC.20 Agents that target EGFR have been shown to
improve survival in patients with metastatic lung21–28
and pancreatic cancers.29–31 Thus, there is rationale
for studying the efficacy of EGFR-targeted agents in
patients with HCC.
Erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774; OSI Pharmaceuticals,
Melville, NY) is an orally active, potent selective
inhibitor of the EGFR/HER-1-related tyrosine kinase
enzyme. Erlotinib inhibits EGF-dependent proliferation of cancer cells at submicromolar concentrations
and blocks cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase.
Erlotinib is approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for treatment of advanced cancers of the lung and pancreas.

METHODS
Patient Selection
This was an open-label, phase 2 trial of oral erlotinib
in patients with advanced HCC that was deemed not
amenable to surgical resection, liver transplantation,
or locoregional therapies. Eligibility criteria included

an age of 18 years or older with histologically confirmed HCC. Slides from a biopsy or resection from
an outside institution were reviewed and confirmed
by the M. D. Anderson Pathology Department. All eligible patients were required to provide paraffin
block(s) or unstained slides for evaluation of EGFR
status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients
were required to have measurable disease by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST; National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program, Bethesda, Md) criteria. No prior
systemic therapy was allowed; prior allowed therapies included resection or locoregional therapies.
Patients with fibrolamellar HCC, a rare subtype of
HCC that is relatively indolent, were excluded. Other
key eligibility criteria included Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of
0, 1, or 2, adequate bone marrow and renal function
as indicated by absolute peripheral granulocyte
count of 1500 mm3, platelet count 60,000/mm3,
hemoglobin 10 g/dL, and serum creatinine 2 mg/
dL. Adequate hepatic function was defined by total
bilirubin <1.8 g/dL, transaminases up to 5 times the
upper limit of institutional normal, serum albumin
2.8 g/dL, and prothrombin time prolonged no longer than 1–3 seconds greater that the institutional
normal value. Patients with decompensated liver disease, as evidenced by jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites refractory to medical management, and
hyponatremia with serum sodium <125, or variceal
bleed within the prior 3 months, were ineligible.
Other exclusion criteria included uncontrolled medical comorbidities, history of corneal disease, inability
to take oral medications, presence of human immunodeficiency virus, or central nervous system metastases. The study was approved by the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Tex)
Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients before study enrollment in compliance with federal and institutional
guidelines. The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment Plan
Patients received erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg orally
per day, continuously for a 28-day course. Patients
were prospectively stratified by EGFR-receptor status.
Dose modifications were allowed according to Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (National Cancer
Institute) to 100 or 50 mg per day. Patients who
required dose reductions beyond 50 mg daily were
removed from the study. No dose re-escalation was
allowed after dose reduction due to toxicity. Treatment was held for up to 21 days for grade 3 or 4

toxicity until resolution to baseline. Erlotinib was
then reinstituted at a reduced dose.

Determination of EGFR Expression
To ascertain whether HCC tumor expression of EGFR
correlated with erlotinib activity, patients were prospectively stratified into ‘‘EGFR high’’ and ‘‘EGFR
low’’ expression cohorts. All eligible patients were
required to provide paraffin block(s) or unstained
slides for evaluation of EGFR status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This assay detects the presence of
EGFR receptors and does not determine the functional status of the receptor (eg, phosphorylated
EGFR), as the latter can be performed on fresh tissue
only. EGFR tissue expression was assayed by using
the mouse monoclonal antibody 31G7 from Zymed
Laboratories (South San Francisco, Calif) at 1:50 dilutions. The detection system uses a dextran polymer
conjugated with both secondary goat antimouse antibody molecules and horseradish peroxidase. Positive
and negative control cell lines were included with
each assay. Control cell lines were fixed in formalin;
cell pellets that represented a moderate level of
EGFR expression were used for the positive-control
cell line (HT-29), and a cell line that did not express
detectable EGFR (CAMA-1) was used for the negative-control cell line. After staining, each specimen
was reviewed for the presence of tumor cells, the
level of membranous staining, staining intensity, and
the percentage of tumor cells that stained positively.
In addition, other elements were evaluated including
staining of the normal tissue elements, background,
and level of cytoplasmic staining. Tumor specimens
were scored by 1 pathologist as ‘‘low EGFR’’ (either
no staining or weak membranous staining of tumor
cells) or ‘‘high EGFR expression’’ (moderate or strong
membranous staining of tumor cells).
Disease Assessment
Response to erlotinib therapy was assessed by using
RECIST criteria.32 Computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the study of
choice. Measurable disease was defined as that
which could be measured in at least 1 dimension
(longest diameter to be recorded, LD) as 20 mm
with conventional radiographic techniques or 10
mm with spiral CT scanning. All other lesions 10
mm were considered nonmeasurable disease and
were recorded as being present or absent. All measurable lesions up to maximum of 10 lesions were
identified as target lesions and recorded at baseline.
A sum of the LD for all target lesions was calculated
and reported. All target lesions identified at baseline
were followed on re-evaluation and scored. Total

1061

disappearance of all target lesions was a complete
response (CR); a partial response (PR) was at least a
30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; progressive disease (PD) was indicated
by at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of
target lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined to
have neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment
started.

Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of this phase 2 trial was the
binary variable progression-free survival (PFS) at 16
weeks of treatment with erlotinib. Success was considered stable disease or objective response by 16
weeks of continuous treatment. The basis for this
endpoint was 2-fold. 1) The likelihood of actual
objective tumor responses with erlotinib in HCC
patients was expected to be very low. 2) The median
time to progression of patients treated with several
cytotoxic agents in similar phase 2 trials in advanced
HCC patients has been reported in the range of 16
weeks.33–39 The design of Simon and Thall40,41 was
used. Patients were stratified prospectively by ‘‘EGFR
low’’ and ‘‘EGFR high’’ expression. An early stopping
criterion was applied separately to the 2 EGFR strata,
to terminate the trial if at any time, Prob[pOSI-774
>ps20.10] < 0.10. The boundaries applied separately
to the 2 strata defined by EGFR status at baseline
were for each stratum of PFS at 16 weeks, STOP for
lack of efficacy if the number of patients alive and
progression-free at 16 weeks was less than or equal
to 0 of 5, 1 of 10, 2 of 14, 3 of 18, 4 of 22, 5 of 26, 6
of 31, 7 of 34, or 8 of 38. Data for each patient stratum was analyzed on a nearly continuous basis to
determine whether stopping criteria had been met
and whether the stratum should continue accruing
patients.
Patient characteristics are summarized by using
median (range) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. The
overall survival (OS) probability and progression-free
survival (PFS) probability are estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method.42 Log-rank test43 was used to
test the difference in OS or PFS between subgroups
of patients. Patients’ disease control rate, PFS rates at
16 weeks or 24 weeks were estimated, along with the
exact 95% confidence intervals (CI). Univariate and
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were
fit for OS and PFS to assess the effect of patient characteristics simultaneously. All statistical analysis were
carried out in Splus.44

The initial study design included a maximum of
40 patients per EGFR stratum (ie, potentially 80
patients in total). When a total of 40 patients were
enrolled in the study, a ‘‘futility analysis’’ was performed. The analysis indicated that results of the
trial would not change if accrual continued to a total
of up to 80 patients. Because the study endpoint (ie,
would treatment with erlotinib result in a PFS at
16 weeks of 35%? [progression-free survival (PFS) at
16 weeks was 43% as noted in Table 1]) had been
met, accrual was terminated at 40 patients.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 40 patients were treated at the University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
Texas, with erlotinib between October 2002 and August 2005. Patients’ characteristics are summarized in
Table 2. A calculation of the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score for each patient was made
and added to our data retrospectively. The CLIP (1–5
scale) score is a prognostic system developed for and
validated in patients with HCC and incorporates the
Childs-Pugh score, tumor morphology, serum a-fetoprotein, and vascular invasion. Higher CLIP scores
correlate with worse prognoses.45–48
Erlotinib Administration
A total of 137 courses (defined as 28 days) of erlotinib were administered (median, 2 courses; range,
1–16).
Toxicity
The most common drug-related adverse events (all
grades, Table 3) were diarrhea, folliculitis, fatigue,
pruritus, dry skin, xerostomia, and epistaxis. Grade 3
toxicities included diarrhea (7.5%), fatigue, (7.5%),

survival (PFS) is 17 of 40 (42.5%), with the exact 95%
confidence interval of 22.7% to 54.2%. Among the
total of 40 patients, 38 (95%) patients failed, defined
as either disease progression or death. The median
time to failure was 13.3 weeks, with a 95% confidence interval of 8.1 to 23.9 weeks. The disease control rate, defined as the proportion of patients who
had stable disease at the time of any on-study disease assessment, was 43%.
The median time to death was 43.1 weeks (10.75
months; 95% CI, 27–106 weeks) if recorded from date
of HCC diagnosis and was 25.0 weeks (95% CI, 17.9–
42.3 weeks) if recorded from date of erlotinib therapy
initiation. Figure 1 (top) shows the Kaplan-Meier
curves for overall survival probability, when overall
survivals were measured from these 2 different starting points. There was a significant difference in overall survival between patients with CLIP score <4 and
those with CLIP score 4 (Table 4; P 5 .01). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were fit by using the patient characteristic
variables listed in Table 2. The final fitted model for
overall survival is presented in Table 4. The model
suggests that the risk of death increases in patients

1063

with younger age, higher alkaline phosphatase, and
with CLIP score 4. The final fitted model for PFS is
presented in Table 5. The model suggests that the
risk of failure had a significant increase in patients
with PS > 0, compared with those with PS 5 0
(P 5 .01).
Figure 1 (top) shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for
overall survival probability, as measured from both
the date of HCC diagnosis and the start date of erlotinib therapy. Figure 1 (bottom) shows the KaplanMeier curve for PFS probability, where PFS was
defined as time from the start of therapy to disease
progression, death, or last follow-up, dependent
upon which occurred first. If a patient came off
study without either event, PFS was censored at the
date of the last disease evaluation.

EGFR Expression
Sufficient tissue for EGFR immunohistochemistry
was available from 38 of the 40 enrolled patients.
Twenty-7 (71%) patient tumor specimens were
scored as high EGFR expression and 11 as low EGFR
expression. Kaplan-Meier curves by EGFR status
(data not shown) suggest that there was no significant difference in terms of overall survival between
the high-EGFR and low-EGFR groups (P 5 .66).

DISCUSSION
In the absence of a randomized trial, deriving conclusions on relative benefits of any systemic therapy
is always challenging. The value of results of this single-arm study of erlotinib in HCC can only be evaluated in the context of clinical trial results in similar
patient populations. Such comparisons to historical
controls are always flawed and are particularly difficult in HCC because of the significant heterogeneity
inherent in this patient population. Furthermore,
many published studies do not report specifically
how endpoints such as survival and PFS were calculated, thus the value of direct comparisons among
studies is very limited. However, the intent of traditional phase 2 single-arm trials is to identify a
reasonable ‘‘biological signal’’ of potential patient
benefit and, thus, provide a sound rationale for further drug development. In HCC patients, the majority of whom have underlying hepatic dysfunction
that can significantly alter drug metabolism and,
therefore, toxicity, a better understanding of the
adverse-event profile of the drug being studied is an
additional benefit of phase 2 trials.
A similar, previously published study of erlotinib in
HCC49 reported a median survival of 13 months and a
disease control rate of 59%, both figures somewhat

more favorable than those reported here. Again, one
would not expect concordance between results from
2 nonrandomized, small sample-size studies. The
patient characteristics in the 2 studies were similar
in that the majority of patients had ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and had Childs-Pugh A cirrhosis.
However, when analyzed by prognostic criteria specific to HCC, the patients treated in the study reported
here generally were a moderate to poor prognostic

group; 37% (15 of 40) patients were CLIP score 3 or
higher, which is predictive of very poor prognosis.45
This difference may account for the somewhat
poorer median survival seen in this trial, although
the Philip trial49 did not report patient CLIP score
data to provide a basis for comparison. Although in
the current study, a majority (71%) of patients’ tumor
specimens were identified by immunohistochemistry
as showing high EGFR overexpression, which is

Erlotinib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma/Thomas et al.

generally consistent with that reported in recent literature for HCC,50–53 EGFR expression did not correlate
with overall survival.
The side-effect profile, including skin changes,
fatigue, diarrhea, epistaxis, and anorexia, is very typical for erlotinib, did not result in any dose-reductions, and was generally well tolerated by HCC

patients. Erlotinib did not cause myelosuppression or
significant hepatic or renal toxicity, which are both
common in patients with hepatic insufficiency.
In this study, although no radiographic tumor
responses were seen on treatment, the primary endpoint of the trial, which was to achieve a median
PFS at 16 weeks of erlotinib therapy of >35%, was
reached (Table 1). The median survival of the evaluable patients was 10.7 months, which is longer than
the median survival of 6 months reported in several
recently published trials in advanced HCC patients
(Table 6). Table 6 includes a broad variety of phase 2
and 3 trials of both cytotoxic and biologic agents in
HCC to provide some reasonable context to evaluate
the results of this trial. It is well documented that
patients with advanced HCC who are not eligible for
surgical or locoregional therapies have median survival in the range of 4 months to 8 months. Much of
the available HCC literature addresses patients who
have undergone or are eligible for resection, ablation,
or regional therapies; the outcome for such early
stage patients cannot be compared with that for
patients with advanced disease. In this context, the
median survival of 10.7 months reported here suggests that single-agent erlotinib provides some modest improvement in patient survival in a
representative, advanced HCC patient population
when compared with a variety of both cytotoxic and
biologic agents in other HCC trials. We recognize,
however, that the median survival of 10.75 months in

this trial may represent nothing more than favorable
patient selection.
We believe erlotinib warrants further study as
combination therapy with other biologic agents in
hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Given the many
limitations inherent in conducting and interpreting
results of single-arm trials, particularly in an heterogeneous malignancy such as HCC, a better approach
for future studies may be to consider randomized
phase 2 designs to provide a more reasonable basis
for comparison than historical controls.
