BACKGROUND: To assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of base-excision repair genes and clinical
outcomes, the roles of genetic variants of 3 selected genes—flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1), 8-hydroxyguanine DNA
glycosylase (hOGG1), and nei endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1)—were investigated in radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET), radiation pneumonitis (RP), and overall survival (OS) after radio(chemo)therapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC). METHODS: NEIL1 reference SNP 4462560 (rs4462560) and rs7402844, hOGG1 rs1052133 and rs293795, and FEN1 rs4246215
and rs174538 were genotyped in 187 patients with ESCC who received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. KaplanMeier cumulative probabilities and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of the genotypes on
the risk of RIET, RP, and OS. RESULTS: The authors observed that patients who had the NEIL1 rs4462560 GC=CC genotype had a
statistically significantly lower risk of both grade 2 acute radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR],
0.421; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.207-0.856; P 5.017) and grade 2 acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) (adjusted HR, 0.392; 95%
CI, 0.163-0.946; P 5.037) compared with patients who had the GG genotype, but the genotype did not affect OS (adjusted HR,
0.778; 95% CI, 0.471-1.284; P 5.326). There were no significant findings for other the SNPs under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The
NEIL1 rs4462560 SNP may serve as a predictor of acute RIET and RP risk but not of OS. Larger prospective studies are needed to valC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) are 2 major side effects of thoracic radiotherapy that have been well studied in patients with lung cancer.1-3 Nevertheless, there is significant variation in the risk of
radiation toxicities among patients, even when their normal tissues have been exposed to the same dose range or volume of
irradiation, suggesting that genetic makeup determines an individual’s susceptibility to radiation toxicities. Therefore, it is
important to identify critical biomarkers that may optimize individual therapy by adjusting the patient’s radiation dose.
The base-excision repair (BER) pathway is a major pathway responsible for the removal of DNA damage caused by
the action of reactive oxygen species and alkylating agents. BER facilitates the repair of damaged DNA through 2 pathways: a short-patch pathway and a long-patch pathway.4 For example, nei endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1) and 8hydroxyguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) are 2 glycosylases involved in the short-patch pathway that participate in
removing oxidatively induced DNA base lesions; whereas flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is essential for the
long-patch pathway, which conducts a repair tract of at least 2 nucleotides.4-6 It has been demonstrated that suboptimal
BER capacity may increase tissue radiosensitivity and produce more severe radiation toxicity.7-9 In fact, a few studies have
suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BER genes may function as biomarkers for susceptibility to

outcomes; however, those studies focused primarily on
cancers of the esophagus, lung, breast, and cervix and had
relatively small sample sizes.10-15
In view of published studies, we hypothesized that
functional SNPs of BER genes may be useful biomarkers
for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who receive definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. To test
this hypothesis, we performed a case-only study in which
we genotyped 6 SNPs in 3 BER pathway genes—FEN1,
hOGG1, and NEIL1—and evaluated their roles in the development of acute RIET and RP. In addition, we assessed
the association between these SNPs and OS in the same
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This study included 187 patients with ESCC who
received treatment at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer
Center between 2008 and 2011. The patient selection criteria included the following: 1) newly diagnosed and histopathologically confirmed ESCC; 2) the intent to
administer definitive radiotherapy or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (total radiation dose, 50 grays
[Gy]); 3) the patient received intensity-modulated radiation therapy; and 4) blood samples and signed informed
consent forms were obtained before radiotherapy. Acute
esophagitis and acute pneumonitis were graded according
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 4.0.16
Dosimetric data were calculated using the Philips
Healthcare radiation therapy planning system (Pinnacle
8.0; Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, Calif)
for each patient, including the mean dose to the entire
esophagus (MED), the length of gross tumor volume
(GTV) of primary esophageal cancer (LGTV-P), the
length of the esophagus that received at least 50 Gy
(LE50), the mean lung dose (MLD), and the volume of
lung that received at least 20 Gy (V20). The entire esophagus (from the bottom of the cricoid cartilage to the gastroesophageal junction) included the esophageal tumor
(GTV-P) and the normal esophagus, which were separately contoured as 2 parts.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Selection and
Genotyping

The National Center for Biotechnology Information
dbSNP database (http:==www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov=, accessed August 25, 2013) and SNPinfo (available at:
4206

http:==snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov=, accessed August 25, 2013)
were used to identify the common, potentially functional
SNPs based on the following 3 criteria: 1) located at the
regulatory regions of genes (ie, the 50 near gene, the 50
untranslated region [UTR], the 30 UTR, the 30 near gene,
and splice sites) or coding regions; 2) a minor allele frequency (MAF) 5% in Han, Beijing (CHB) descendants
reported in the dbSNP database; and 3) affected the activity of microRNA binding sites and transcription factor
binding sites in the putative promoter region or changed
the amino acid in the exons. Consequently, 1 SNP in the
30 UTR of FEN1 (SNP reference 4246215 [rs4246215];
T!G), 1 SNP in the 50 near gene of FEN1 (rs174538;
G!A), 1 SNP in the 30 near gene of NEIL1 (rs4462560;
C!G), and 1 SNP in the exon of hOGG1 (rs1052133;
G!C) were finally selected for genotyping in the study
population. In addition, we added 2 more SNPs as references, including 1 in the 50 near gene of NEIL1
(rs7402844; C!G) and 1 in the 30 UTR of hOGG1
(rs293795; G!A), because it has been predicted that
these are potentially functional; however, the MAF did
not completely meet the criteria, because the former had
an MAF of 30% in CHB and Japanese in Tokyo combined, and the later had an MAF of 4.8% in CHB. A
linkage disequilibrium analysis suggested that these 6
potentially functional SNPs also captured 75 other
untyped SNPs within the 3 selected genes or in nearby
genes. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples,
and assays were performed for genotyping (TaqMan; Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif), as described previously,17
with a successful genotyping rate of 99.8%. The genotyping assays were repeated for 10% of the samples, and the
results were 100% concordant.
Statistical Methods

The chi-square test was used to assess the differences in
frequency distributions of the selected demographic variables, risk factors, alleles, and genotypes of the selected
SNPs between the cases and controls. Univariate Cox proportion hazards regression analysis was performed to calculate the hazards ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI)
for the effects of genotypes on the risk of RP, RIET, and
OS. In addition, multivariate Cox hazards regression analysis was performed to adjust for other covariates. KaplanMeier curves were used to estimate the cumulative RP and
RIET probability and OS.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes

The study included 187 patients with ESCC with a median age of 64 years (range, 37-88 years), of whom 73.8%

(138 of 187 patients) were men. The median total radiation dose was 62.0 Gy (range, 50-68 Gy) at doses of 1.8 to
2.25 Gy per fraction. Of all 187 patients, 49 (26.2%)
received radiation therapy alone, and 138 (73.8%)
received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. The chemotherapeutic agents were either cisplatin-based or
fluorouracil-based. Baseline clinical and dosimetric characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.
At the time of the last follow-up (January 2013), 97
patients (55.1%) had died with a median survival time
(MST) of 11 months (range, 1-49 months), and 79
patients (44.9%) were still alive for an MST of 27 months
(range, 14-48 months). The OS rates at 1 year, 2 years,
and 3 years were 70.5%, 49.9%, and 43.4%, respectively.
Although none of the patients in this study suffered
death caused by acute radiation-induced toxicity, 42
patients (22.5%) exhibited grade 2 acute RIET (ie,
grade 2, 3, and 4 toxicities were observed in 33 patients, 6
patients, and 3 patients, respectively). In addition, 28
patients (15%) exhibited grade 2 acute RP (ie, grade 2,
3, and 4 toxicities were observed in 23 patients, 5 patients,
and zero patients, respectively). The median time to
occurrence was 24 days after the first day of irradiation for
patients with RIET and 35 days after the first day of irradiation for patients with RP.
FEN1, hOGG1, and NEIL1 Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms and the Risk of RadiationInduced Esophageal Toxicity

Table 1 displays results from the univariate and multivariate analyses of patient-related, tumor-related, and
therapy-related characteristics and grade 2 RIET.
Patients aged >65 years had less RIET risk compared
with those aged 65 years (adjusted P 5 .032). The LE50
was also associated with RIET risk, and patients who
exposed >10 cm of the esophagus to 50 Gy of irradiation had a more than 5-fold greater RIET risk compared
with those who exposed 10 cm of the esophagus
(adjusted P 5 .037). Table 2 displays the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for RIET risk by FEN1,
hOGG1, and NEIL1 genotypes. The NEIL1 rs4462560
GC=CC genotypes were associated with significantly
lower risk of grade 2 RIET than the GG genotype in a
multivariate model with adjustment for age, sex, smoking
status, type of treatment, mean esophageal dose, radiation
dose, fraction dose, stage, LGTV-P, and LE50 (adjusted
HR, 0.421; 95% CI, 0.207-0.856; P 5 .017) (Fig. 1);
whereas the rs7402844 SNP had no association with the
risk of RIET. Furthermore, the hOGG1 rs293795 and
rs1052133 SNPs and the FEN1 rs4246215 and rs174538

Table 1 lists the associations between clinical and dosimetric parameters and the risk of grade 2 RP. The V20
value was associated significantly with the risk of RP in
both univariate and multivariate analyses (adjusted
P 5 .038). None of the other characteristics were associated with RP risk in this study population.
The associations of FEN1, hOGG1, and NEIL1 genotypes with the risk of grade 2 RP were analyzed using
a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Patients
who had the NEIL1 rs4462560 GC=CC genotypes had a
decreased RP risk in multivariate analysis compared with
those who had the GG genotype (adjusted HR, 0.392;
95% CI, 0.163-0.946; P 5 .037) (Fig. 1) with adjustment
for age, sex, smoking status, type of treatment, MLD,
radiation dose, fraction dose, stage, and V20. No significant associations between the risk of RP and the other genotypes were observed (NEIL1 rs7402844, hOGG1
rs1052133 and rs293795, FEN1 rs4246215 and
rs174538) (Table 2).
FEN1, hOGG1, and NEIL1 Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms and Overall Survival

Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that
the variables LGTV-P and stage were associated significantly with OS (adjusted P 5 .026 and P 5 .011, respectively) (Table 1). However, the data failed to demonstrate
any association between genotypes of BER genes and OS
(Table 2).
DISCUSSION
NEIL1, which is located on chromosome 15q23, was first
identified in 2002 as a gene encoding a human glycosylase
that participates in the first step of the BER pathway,
modifying the bases with oxidative damage.18 It has been
established that NEIL1 is a critical component of BER
that may incorporate deoxyuridylate to repair DNA damage caused by thymidylate synthetase pathway inhibitors.19 Rosenquist et al discovered that NEIL1 acts as
compensation for the other BER genes, such as OGG1
and neutral trehalase 1(NTH1). For example, it is
reported that NEIL1 repairs lesions like FapyA and 5S-6R
thymine glycol, which cannot be excised by OGG1 or
NTH1.8 Rosenquist et al further discovered that embryonic stem cell lines with no NEIL1 expression were
approximately twice as sensitive to low levels of irradiation

Figure 1. The cumulative probabilities of (a) radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET) and (b) radiation pneumonitis (RP) are
illustrated as a function of time from the start of therapy according to genotypes of the NEIL1 rs4462560 single nucleotide polymorphism. The NEIL1 rs4462560 GG genotype was associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of both RIET and
RP compared with GC=CC genotypes.

as the control cells.8 Zhai et al investigated the associations
between SNPs of NEIL1=NEIL2 and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx;
and they observed that the NEIL2 rs804270 CC genotype
was associated with advanced tumor stages, but they did
not observe a risk associated with either NEIL1
rs7182283 or rs4462560 SNPs.20 However, there is no
report for a role of functional NEIL1 polymorphisms in
OS or the risk of radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity
like RP and RIET.
In this study, the data demonstrated that patients
with the NEIL1 rs4462560 GG genotype had a statistically significantly elevated risk of both grade 2 RIET
and grade 2 RP compared with those who had GC=CC
genotypes. Nevertheless, none of the 6 SNPs were associated with OS. It is likely that our sample size was not large
enough to detect some weak associations, if any.
Our data indicated that the 1-year and 2-year survival rates in this Chinese patient cohort were 71% and
51%, respectively, which were similar to those reported
from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
0113 or RTOG 9405 trials in the United States.21
Because of the advances in radiotherapy technology and
the improvement of quality assurance, dosimetric parameters like LE50, V20, and MLD have decreased, and the
numbers of patients who develop either grade 3 RIET
Cancer

December 1, 2013

or grade 3 RP have decreased accordingly. Therefore,
we chose grade 2 RIET and grade 2 RP as the cutoff
targets for analysis in the current study. We used the parameter of esophageal length instead of the volume that
received a certain dose or more by considering that there
were diverse ways to contour the esophagus and measure
the length, which are much easier if done consistently. We
observed that age was a significant factor affecting RIET,
a finding consistent with the study by Ahn et al,22 and
that LE50 was associated with RIET in multivariate analyses, although no statistical significance was detected in
univariate analysis. We also demonstrated that V20 was
an important dosimetric parameter of predicting the risk
of RP, which is highly consistent with other reported studies.23-26
We assumed that the HR of DNA SNPs on acute
radiation-induced toxicities was >1.5 or <0.67 based on
findings from previous studies, and we calculated the
power with a significance level of a 5 .05. Consequently,
we observed that our sample size of 187 patients would
have 21.1% and 67.9% power to detect an HR of 1.5 for
the variant genotype with MAF values of 5% and 30%,
respectively. The power increased as the HR and MAF
increased. For example, our current study had a power of
99.1% to detect an HR of 0.421 for rs4462560 GC=CC
versus GG for the risk of grade 2 acute RIET with an

TABLE 2. Associations Between Genotypes and Grade 2 Radiation-Induced Esophageal Toxicity, Grade 2 Radiation Pneumonitis, and Overall Survival

NEIL1 rs4462560 Predicts RIET and RP/Chen et al

MAF of 43.6%. In addition, we performed a multiple
comparison analysis (for 6 SNPs) and observed that the
true P value was > .05 according to the Bonferroni adjustment. Indeed, because all methods of testing multiple
comparisons are very conservative when exploring candidate genes with a prior hypothesis, we call for additional
large studies to replicate our findings. Once our results are
validated in larger studies, by knowing the NEIL1
rs4462560 genotypes before patients receive radiation
therapy, we could help patients to reduce the chance of
developing RIET or RP, because radiation oncologists
may be able to revise the prescription dose or use other
strategies to protect the normal esophagus and lungs.
While we look forward to other investigators validating
our observations in larger studies, we are planning to substantiate our findings by increasing our sample size and
performing molecular mechanism investigations in future
studies.
