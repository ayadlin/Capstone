ABSTRACT:

The inability to faithfully segregate chromosomes in mitosis results in chromosome
instability, a hallmark of solid tumors. Disruption of microtubule dynamics
contributes highly to mitotic chromosome instability. The kinesin-13 family is critical
in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and the best characterized member of
the family, the mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), has recently been
attracting enormous attention. MCAK regulates microtubule dynamics as a potent
depolymerizer of microtubules by removing tubulin subunits from the polymer end.
This depolymerizing activity plays pivotal roles in spindle formation, in correcting
erroneous attachments of microtubule-kinetochore and in chromosome movement.
Thus, the accurate regulation of MCAK is important for ensuring the faithful
segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and for safeguarding chromosome stability. In
this review we summarize recent data concerning the regulation of MCAK by mitotic
kinases, Aurora A/B, Polo-like kinase 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1. We propose
a molecular model of the regulation of MCAK by these mitotic kinases and relevant
phosphatases throughout mitosis. An ever-increasing quantity of data indicates that
MCAK is aberrantly regulated in cancer cells. This deregulation is linked to increased
malignance, invasiveness, metastasis and drug resistance, most probably due to
increased chromosomal instability and remodeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton
in cancer cells. Most interestingly, recent observations suggest that MCAK could be
a novel molecular target for cancer therapy, as a new cancer antigen or as a mitotic
regulator. This collection of new data indicates that MCAK could be a new star in
the cancer research sky due to its critical roles in the control of genome stability
and the cytoskeleton. Further investigations are required to dissect the fine details
of the regulation of MCAK throughout mitosis and its involvements in oncogenesis.

chromosome congression and chromosome segregation.
Correct bipolar spindle formation and attachment of
chromosomes to the microtubules (MTs) are prerequisites
for the accurate segregation of chromosomes resulting in
an errorless chromosome complement in both daughter
cells. The inability to faithfully segregate chromosomes in
mitosis causes chromosome instability (CIN), a hallmark
of solid tumors. It is becoming increasingly clear that CIN
is not simply a passenger phenotype but likely plays a
causative role in a substantial proportion of malignancies
[2]. Moreover, CIN positively correlates with poor
patient prognosis, indicating that reduced mitotic fidelity
contributes to cancer progression by increasing genetic
diversity among tumor cells [3,4]. Disruption of
microtubule dynamics in the mitotic spindle generates
mitotic chromosomal instability, commonly caused by
the persistent mal-oriented attachment of chromosomes to
spindle MTs. Microtubule dynamics, mediated by highly
coordinated dynamic growth and shrinkage, governs
both chromosome bi-orientation and segregation during
cell division [5]. The kinesin-13 family members of MT
depolymerizers play essential roles in controlling MT
dynamics [6-12].

MTs from either end with a comparable rate [26].
Structurally, MCAK has an N-terminal domain, followed
by a positively charged neck, a central catalytic motor
domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain [6]. The
catalytic core of MCAK is necessary but not sufficient
for depolymerization under physiological conditions
and inclusion of the neck domain restores full MT
depolymerization activity to the MCAK core motor
[27]. Neutralization of the positively charged neck by
site-directed mutagenesis markedly reduces enzymatic
activity both in vivo and in vitro [28]. Additionally, the
neck is vertically directed toward the surface of the MT
between the protofilament groove [14]. More recently, the
contribution of the neck domain to MCAK’s activity has
been precisely studied by applying total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy at the single molecule
level: MCAK’s positively charged neck enhances its
delivery to MT ends by catalyzing the association of
MCAK to MTs [29].
Whilst the neck region is important, it is the core
motor domain of MCAK that drives MT depolymerization
most likely by causing microtubule protofilaments to
adopt a depolymerization competent curved conformation.
X-ray crystallographic studies show that the MT-binding
surface of the core motor adopts a convex form predicted
to match the concave shape of a curved MT protofilament
[14,30]. Additionally, MCAK bound with AMPPNP, a
non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, stabilizes protofilament
curls and rings [31-34]. The currently favored model of
how this ability to encourage curving of MT protofilaments
translates into depolymerization is that MCAK’s ATP
turnover cycle, in conjunction with the alteration of
this cycle by interaction with the MT, results in MCAK
remaining in a weakly bound diffusion competent state
whilst on the MT lattice but to switch into a tightly bound
depolymerization competent state at or close to the MT
end [35]. Here, at the MT end, MCAK can exert its curve
inducing effect on the MT protofilaments to best advantage
resulting in potent depolymerization activity. In accord
with this, an MCAK-decorated bead in the presence of
ATP can attach to the MT side, but readily slides along it
in either direction under weak external loads. However,
the bead is tightly captured by the MT ends and readily
causes MT disassembly [36].
While MCAK is found in the cytoplasm throughout
the cell cycle, it is highly enriched at centrosomes,
centromeres/kinetochores and the spindle midzone
during mitosis [19,37,38]. In line with this localization,
MCAK influences many aspects of mitosis such as
spindle assembly, MT dynamics, correct kinetochoremicrotubule attachments, and chromosome positioning
and segregation [11,37,39-41]. Depletion or inhibition of
MCAK activity results in improper spindle maintenance
and misaligned chromosomes during metaphase in
Xenopus extract spindles and lagging chromosomes
during anaphase [37-39]. Decreased MCAK activity

MITOTIC CENTROMERE-ASSOCIATED
KINESIN (MCAK) AND THE KINESIN-13
FAMILY
Unlike other kinesins, the members of the kinesin-13
family do not use the energy from ATP turnover to move
directionally along MTs but, instead, depolymerize them
by disassembling tubulin subunits from the polymer end
[13,14]. This family is characterized by the localization of
the conserved kinesin motor domain in the middle of the
polypeptide [15]. Variable numbers of kinesin-13 family
members exist in invertebrate species, such as Klp10A,
Klp59C, and Klp59D in Drosophila melanogaster [16]. In
mammals, three unique genes corresponding to kinesin-13
family members have been identified: Kif2A [17], Kif2B
[18] and Kif2C or mitotic centromere-associated kinesin
(MCAK) [19]. Kif2A is localized mainly at the centrosome
and contributes to bipolar spindle assembly and MT flux,
whereas Kif2C/MCAK is found to be localized at the
centromere and regulates MT turnover at the kinetochore
[6,11,16,20,21] and also at the plus-ends of interphase
and mitotic astral MTs [22-24]. Kif2B has been less well
studied. However, it has recently been shown that Kif2B
localizes to centrosomes, spindle MTs, kinetochores
and the midbody, and is important for spindle assembly,
chromosome movement and cytokinesis [8]. Kif24, the
fourth member of the kinesin family-13, localizes to
centrioles and has recently been implicated in ciliogenesis
[25].
MCAK/Kif2C, the founding and best-characterized
member of the kinesin-13 family, has an extraordinarily
high affinity for MT ends and catalytically destabilizes

specifically at the centromere leads to poor coordination
of chromosome movement, increased kinetochore
fiber stability, as measured by acetylated tubulin
fluorescence, and increased lagging chromosomes [42].
These effects could be reversed by ectopic anchoring of
excess MCAK to centromeres. In addition, analysis of
lagging chromatids in mammalian Ptk2 cells depleted
of centromeric MCAK shows stretched staining of an
autoimmune antibody CREST, a kinetochore marker,
indicative of merotelic kinetochore-MT attachment [43].
These erroneous attachments lead to the loss or gain of
chromosomes in daughter cells known as “aneuploidy”,
which is characteristic of cancer cells [44]. This suggests
that MCAK is involved in correcting mal-attachments
of kinetochores to MTs prior to anaphase. Thus, precise
control of the localization and activity of MCAK is crucial
for maintaining genetic integrity during mitosis.
One mechanism by which MCAK is regulated is by
association with cofactors such as ICIS (Inner Centromere
Kin I Stimulator) [45], hSgo2 [46], EB1 [22,24,47] and
TIP150 [48]. More interestingly, an increasing body
of data is emerging suggesting that the activity and
localization of MCAK is regulated via phosphorylation
by important mitotic kinases.

shown to be phosphorylated by Aurora B [60-62]. Further
immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining
confirm T92 in Chinese hamster MCAK [61] and S196 in
Xenopus MCAK [60] are phosphorylated during mitosis
in living cells. Aurora B phosphorylation of MCAK
strongly inhibits its ability to destabilize MTs [60-62]. In
particular, phosphorylation at S196 appears critical to this
activity [60]. Moreover, inhibition of Aurora B activity
blocks MCAK accumulation at centromeres [60,61].
Microinjection of anti-phospho-S196 antibodies causes
misalignment of chromosomes at metaphase in Xenopus
egg extracts and delays chromosome congression to the
metaphase plate in cells [61]. Intriguingly, phosphomimetic MCAK concentrates at the inner centromere,
whereas unphosphorylated MCAK prefers a more
distal location [61]. These data indicate that Aurora B
phosphorylation both positively and negatively regulates
MCAK activity by positively influencing the localization
of MCAK to the centromere and negatively controlling its
MT destabilizing activity. Interfering with this regulation
generates defects in spindle structure and chromosome
movements in mitosis [60-62]. A fourth important study
has further dissected regulation of MCAK by Aurora B,
suggesting that Aurora B-dependent chromosome arm
and centromere localization is regulated by a distinct twosite phosphorylation mechanisms: T95 phosphorylation
facilities MCAK’s association with chromosome arms,
whereas phosphorylation of S196 causes MCAK to
dissociate from chromosome arms and negatively affects
its catalytic activity of MCAK [63].
Aurora B is the master regulator of the merotelic
resolution pathway that recruits and regulates proteins to
correct chromosome-kinetochore mal-attachment [59,64].
Aurora B is required to release improper MT attachments
and MCAK participates in this process [43,65]. However,
how Aurora B-mediated suppression of MCAK activity
can contribute to the correction of improper attachments,
is counter-intuitive. Several working models have been
suggested to explain this issue. It is proposed that the
ratio of MCAK/pS196 MCAK is crucial for this function,
based on the data that the ratio of MCAK/pS196 MCAK
is higher at merotely sites than at properly attached
centromeres, implying MCAK is more active at merotely
sites [66]. A second interesting idea is that kinetochoreassociated MCAK may regulate the attachment status not
solely by releasing the attachment, but rather by loosening
the MTs ends embedded in the kinetochore to alter MT
binding affinity [8,42]. A third model proposes a so called
gradient distribution of Aurora B: when tension across
kinetochores is established at metaphase, the extent of the
Aurora B activity gradient across sister kinetochore pairs
is reduced, inhibition of MCAK by Aurora B is therefore
relieved, and active MCAK acts to promote MT dynamics
necessary to correct mal-orientated chromosomes [10].
More studies are warranted to precisely delineate how
MCAK regulation by Aurora B acts to correct and/or

REGULATION OF MCAK BY AURORA B
Aurora B kinase is the catalytic subunit of the
chromosome passenger complex (CPC), which contains
INCENP, borealin and survivin and is mobile throughout
mitosis: the CPC is found at the chromosome arms,
the inner centromere and the midzone [49]. The CPC
regulates many events in mitosis, including chromosome
congression,
kinetochore-microtubule
attachments,
spindle checkpoint control and chromosome segregation,
by phosphorylating distinct sets of substrates [50,51].
The CPC is responsible for recruiting several groups of
proteins to the kinetochore/centromere at metaphase: outer
kinetochore proteins involved in the spindle assembly
checkpoint (SAC) including Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, BubR1,
Mps1 and Cenp-E [52-54]; proteins responsible for
microtubule-kinetochore interactions, such as Cenp-E,
Ndc80, Knl1, Mis12, Zwilch, p150Glued, Dam1 and
Plk1 [55-57]; and inner centromeric proteins such as the
Shugoshin family proteins Sgo1 and Sgo2 [46,56,58].
Thus, the CPC is a critical regulator of centromere/
kinetochore functions [59]. Most notably, Aurora B kinase
is required for correcting erroneous MT attachments at
kinetochores.
In the search for a molecular understanding of
the mechanism of action of Aurora B, several groups
have focused on the interaction of Aurora B with
MCAK. Three high profile studies have shed light on
MCAK’s regulation by Aurora B [60-62]. Using in vitro
phosphorylation and mass spectroscopy, several sites in
the N-terminus and the neck domain of MCAK have been

cyclin B1, the regulatory subunit of Cdk1, is reminiscent
of that of the inhibition of MCAK. Moreover, MCAK and
Cdk1 co-localize at centrosomes and they are associated
with each other in mitosis. Further work shows that
Cdk1/cyclin B1 regulates the function and localization
of MCAK by phosphorylating T537 in the core domain
[76]. This phosphorylation of MCAK by Cdk1/cyclin
B1 attenuates its MT-destabilizing activity in vitro and in
vivo. Phosphorylation of MCAK by Cdk1 promotes the
release of MCAK from centrosomes and is required for
proper spindle formation. Furthermore, interfering with
the regulation of MCAK by Cdk1 causes dramatic defects
in spindle formation and in chromosome positioning.
Unlike Aurora B, Cdk1 phosphorylates only one residue
T537 in the core domain of MCAK. T537 is located in the
L12 loop, which is immediately C-terminal to the α4 helix
of the core domain in MCAK. It has been suggested that
the α4 helix is directly involved in binding to a curved
conformation of tubulin at the ends of MT protofilaments
and thereby facilitates depolymerization [14]. It is
therefore possible that the introduction of a negative charge
adjacent to the α4 helix via phosphorylation of T537, could
disrupt the interaction of MCAK with the MT end, thus
causing attenuation of MCAK’s MT-destabilizing activity.
Further investigations are required to define precisely how
MCAK is coordinated and controlled by Cdk1/cyclin B1
at centrosomes/spindle poles.

REGULATION OF MCAK BY AURORA A
Aurora A, another member of the Aurora kinase
family, plays many roles in mitosis mainly related to
centrosome functions and spindle assembly. It localizes
to centrosomes and spindle poles and drives centrosome
maturation, separation and bipolar spindle assembly
[67-69]. Aurora A associates with several co-activators
including BORA and TPX2 during cell division that
dictate its localization, activation and substrate preference
[70,71]. Selective inhibition of Aurora A leads to abnormal
mitotic spindles and chromosome segregation defects
[72,73], indicating that Aurora A-associated activity is
critical for spindle formation and spindle dynamics during
mitosis.
Interestingly, several reports associate Aurora A
with MCAK function and localization. In mitotic U2OS
cells in the absence of Aurora A, MCAK is decreased at
spindle poles, whereas ch-TOG (colonic hepatic tumoroverexpressed gene), a functional antagonist of MCAK,
is increased in mitotic U2OS cells, leading to extra-poles
formation [74]. It has also been shown, using Xenopus egg
extracts to form spindles in the absence of chromatin and
centrosomes, that Aurora A controls MCAK’s localization
and activity [75]. This regulation is important to focus MTs
at aster centers and to facilitate the transition from asters
to bipolar spindles. Additionally, MCAK co-localizes
with NuMA and XMAP215 at the center of Ran asters,
where its activity is regulated by Aurora A-dependent
phosphorylation of S196, which contributes to proper
pole focusing. MCAK localization at spindle poles is also
controlled via S719 phosphorylation by Aurora A, which
positively enhances bipolar spindle formation. This study
suggests that Aurora A targets MCAK to spindle poles
via phosphorylation on S719, and regulates its activity
by phosphorylation at S196. It is however unclear how
this phosphorylation of MCAK by Aurora A directs its
localization. These results indicate that Aurora A regulates
the localization of MCAK at spindle poles and that
MCAK is involved in spindle pole integrity. However,
the molecular mechanism by which Aurora A impacts
MCAK’s localization has not been described. Furthermore,
whether this regulation of MCAK by Aurora A also affects
its catalytic activity remains undefined. Nevertheless, as
described above, the localization and activity of MCAK
at the centromere/kinetochore are controlled by Aurora
B kinase, whereas the localization and activity at spindle
poles appear to be regulated by Aurora A.

REGULATION OF MCAK BY POLO-LIKE
KINASE 1(PLK1)
Five mammalian Plk family members have been
identified to date, Plk1-5 [77]. Plk1, the best studied
member of the family [78], is a key regulator of cell
division in eukaryotic cells. Plk1 controls multiple events
in mitosis such as centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle
formation, stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment,
cohesion dissociation, chromosome alignment and
segregation, and cytokinesis [79,80]. In accord with its
diverse functions, the localization of Plk1 during mitosis is
dynamic. Plk1 first associates with centrosomes in prophase
before it localizes to spindle poles and kinetochores
in prometaphase and metaphase. In anaphase, Plk1 is
recruited to the central spindle and finally accumulates
at the midbody in telophase. Proteomic studies using
oriented peptide libraries have shown that the polo-box
binding domain (PBD) at the C-terminus of Plk1, dictates
the localization of this kinase to cellular structures
[81,82]. This domain binds to specific phosphorylated
sequence motifs that are created by other priming kinases
or are self-primed by Plk1 itself, thus providing an
efficient mechanism to regulate localization and substrate
selectivity in time and space [83,84]. Thus, the PBD
provides a much more compelling site to specifically
inhibit Plk1 [85,86]. Plk1 is a proliferation marker and
highly expressed in a broad spectrum of human tumors,

suggestive of its involvement in oncogenesis [77,87,88].
Interestingly, Plk1 expression is affected by several drugs,
like metformin [89]. Despite intensive investigations,
the role of the multifaceted Plk1 in oncogenesis remains
incompletely understood at the molecular level.
It has been revealed that Plx1, the analogue of Plk1
in Xenopus, phosphorylates the N-terminal region (aa
2-116) of MCAK in kinase assay in vitro [90]. Moreover,
priming MCAK by Plx1 produced robust phosphorylation
on T95 site but little on S196 in MCAK by Aurora B,
suggesting that this is the key event to allow Aurora
B to phosphorylate the residue T95 [90]. Since T95
phosphorylation is critical for MCAK’s localization on

Figure 1: Mitotic Regulation of MCAK

chromosome arms in prophase and prometaphase [63],
the data suggest that Plx1 could be the priming kinase
for Aurora B to promote the localization of MCAK to the
chromosome arms. This is an interesting finding indicative
of a collaborative action of Plk 1 and Aurora B in the
regulation of MCAK. It remains to be investigated which
residue in the N-terminus of MCAK is phosphorylated by
Plk1 and how this modification facilitates phosphorylation
of T95 by Aurora B. It is also necessary to define if the
same takes place in vivo and whether this collaboration
model could also be valid for mammalian cells.
A second study dealing with MCAK’s regulation
by Plk1 has recently been reported [91]. Based on the

Figure 1: Scheme of MCAK regulation by mitotic kinases and phosphatases. Current data suggest that MCAK undergoes

complex spatiotemporal regulation by mitotic kinases Aurora A/B, Plk1 and Cdk1/cyclin B1. In early mitosis, S196 phosphorylation
of MCAK by Aurora A reduces its activity and facilitates the transition from asters to bipolar spindles, whilst MCAK localization at
spindle poles is regulated through another Aurora A phosphorylation site S719 and positively enhances bipolar spindle formation. Cdk1
phosphorylates T537 in the core domain of MCAK, attenuates its activity, and drives MCAK from spindle poles to other locations
and promotes proper spindle formation. Thus, the localization and activity of MCAK at centrosomes and spindle poles appear to be
mainly controlled by coordinated regulation of Aurora A and Cdk1. In prometaphase, the localization of MCAK to the chromosome
arms is controlled by Aurora B, possibly supported by Plk1. In metaphase, the localization and activity of MCAK at the centromeres and
kinetochores are finely regulated via phosphorylation by Aurora B. By contrast, Plk1 promotes the activity of MCAK at kinetochores. Coordinated regulation of MCAK by Aurora B and Plk1 might fine-tune its activity for correction of mal-attachments. Finally, in anaphase,
the activity of MCAK is further coordinated and controlled by Aurora B and Plk1, possibly balanced by phosphatases.

spectrometry, six serines (S592, S595, S621, S632,
S633 and S715) at the C-terminus of MCAK have been
identified as substrates of Plk1. In contrast to regulation
by Aurora A/B and Cdk1, phosphorylation of MCAK
by Plk1 stimulates the MT depolymerization activity of
MCAK in cells. Overexpression of a Plk1 phosphomimetic
MCAK mutant causes a dramatic increase in misaligned
chromosomes and in multipolar spindles in mitotic
cells, while overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable
MCAK mutant results in defects in anaphase with sister
chromatid bridges. These data imply that the enhanced
enzymatic activity of MCAK by Plk1 is required for
correction of mal-attachment of MTs. On the other hand,
a temporal dephosphorylation of MCAK is of importance
for proper chromosome alignment and bipolar spindle
formation. This study also suggests that phosphorylation
of MCAK by Plk1 may alter its molecular conformation.
Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the
structural basis of this potential Plk1-induced MCAK
conformational change. Moreover, it will be interesting
to identify the major phosphorylation site in MCAK’s
C-terminus by Plk1 and to dissect the function of each
phosphorylation site. It may be that Plk1 acts in a similar
way as Aurora B phosphorylates different residues in
MCAK controlled both temporally and spatially to
coordinate MCAK’s function at various stages of mitosis.
Furthermore, since both the N-terminus in Xenopus and
the C-terminus in mammalian cells are phosphorylated by
Plx1 and Plk1, respectively, it remains possible that both
regions of MCAK are regulated by Plk1 at different stages
in vivo. It is tempting to speculate that the regulation of
MCAK by Plk1 will exhibit a more complex picture,
even than Aurora B, with various functions depending
on different subcellular locations and on different time
points in mitosis. Moreover, Santamaria and colleagues
have investigated the Plk1-dependent phosphoproteome
of the human mitotic spindle using an elegant method of
isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture [92]. One
of the most interesting findings is that MCAK’s spindle
association is highly dependent on Plk1 activity [92]. It
remains to be explored if Plk1 regulates this association
directly or indirectly.

kinases throughout mitosis (Fig. 1). In early mitosis,
the localization and activity of MCAK at centrosomes
and spindle poles appear to be mainly controlled by
the coordinated regulation of Aurora A and Cdk1. S196
phosphorylation of MCAK by Aurora A reduces its
activity and facilitates the transition from asters to bipolar
spindles, whilst MCAK localization at spindle poles is
regulated through another Aurora A phosphorylation site
S719 and positively enhances bipolar spindle formation.
Cdk1 phosphorylates T537 in the core domain of MCAK,
reducing its activity, and driving MCAK from the spindle
poles to other locations, thus promoting proper spindle
formation. In prometaphase, the localization of MCAK to
the chromosome arms seems to be controlled by Aurora
B, possibly aided by Plk1. In metaphase, the localization
of MCAK at the centromeres and kinetochores is finely
regulated via phosphorylation by Aurora B. In this process,
the activity of MCAK at the centromeres/kinetochores is
potentially positively promoted by Plk1-mediated activity
to fine-tune the regulation by Aurora B. This coordinated
regulation may allow efficient correction of mal-attached
microtubule-kinetochore. Finally, in anaphase, the
activity of MCAK is controlled by Aurora B and Plk1,
balanced possibly by phosphatases. The picture of MCAK
regulation by mitotic kinases (Fig. 1) is still immature and
more studies are needed to complete the picture. The final
picture displaying the temporal and spatial regulation of
MCAK in mitosis may be more complex than we had
previously imagined.
Specific phospho-antibodies targeting each
phosphorylation site by each mitotic kinase will be of
great use in deciphering when, where and by which kinase
MCAK is phosphorylated throughout various mitotic
stages. The specific small molecule compounds targeting
Cdk1, Aurora A, Aurora B or Plk1 will also be useful to
uncover the timing and location of each phosphorylation,
and to study the exact impact of each kinase on MCAK
in mitosis. Moreover, current data imply that timely
dephosphorylation is also necessary for the proper mitotic
function of MCAK, as phospho-mimetic forms of MCAK
induce many defects in mitosis [76,91]. Recent work has
exposed the conserved serine-threonine phosphatases PP1
and PP2A as key regulators of various mitotic processes.
PP1 is known to both localize to kinetochores and to
reverse phosphorylation generated by Aurora B [55],
indicating that PP1 is a prime candidate for opposing
Aurora B-dependent maintenance of kinetochore
integrity. Indeed, kinetochore disassembly following
Aurora B inhibition is prevented by inhibiting PP1 [55].
Thus, the proper regulation of MCAK at the centromeres/
kinetochores likely depends on a biased turnover between
kinases and their counteracting phosphatases. Intensive
investigations are required to understand this network
of regulation. It is also of importance to determine if
interaction partners of MCAK are regulated by the same
mitotic kinases, which will further dissect the molecular

ORCHESTRATED REGULATION OF MCAK
BY MITOTIC KINASES/PHOSPHATASES
During the cell division cycle, mitotic entry,
centrosome separation, spindle assembly, chromosome
congression/segregation, and cytokinesis must all be
tightly coordinated to ensure that the two daughter
cells inherit the same genetic material. Central to this
coordination are several protein kinases including Cdk1,
Plk1, Aurora A and Aurora B, which regulate the functions
of many molecules in a precisely coordinated and finely
tuned manner. Current data suggest that MCAK undergoes

remains much work still to do to define the functional

family found in mammalian cells and also with members
of other kinesin families, such as the family-14 and
family-8 [93,94].

prognosis, particularly in breast, gastric and colorectal
cancer.
Deregulated MCAK results in defects in spindle
formation and chromosome segregation, which lead
to further chromosomal instability. Being capable of
escaping apoptosis and surviving such defects, cancer
cells proliferate regardless of chromosomal instability,
promoting progression of cancer cells. As described above,
it seems p53 is involved in regulating the expression of
MCAK [97]. Further studies are required to corroborate
the relationship between p53 status and the MCAK level
in primary cancer tissues. More questions have to be
addressed: Does p53 directly affect the transcriptional
activation of the MCAK promoter, or indirectly via other
transcriptional factors? As microRNAs (miRNAs) are
becoming more and more important in regulating mRNA
expression of key molecules, is miRNA involved in the
regulation of MCAK mRNA in cancer cells? Or are
elevated levels of MCAK more ascribed to deregulated
protein turnover? Intriguingly, the data suggest that
enhanced MCAK is correlated not only with progression
but also with invasiveness/metastasis in cancer cells,
suggesting MCAK is possibly also involved in the
alteration of cell motility in cancer cells. Cell motility
is a complex process requiring coordinated organization
of actin and MT cytoskeletons in physiological and
pathological conditions such as cancer cell metastasis.
It will be interesting to understand how deregulated
MCAK in cancer cells promotes migration/invasiveness/
metastasis: Is elevated MCAK able to reorganize MT
cytoskeleton and to alter the motility of cancer cells,
in particular, in non-proliferating cancer cells? How do
changes in MCAK levels influence tubulin expression and
auto-regulation? Is deregulated MCAK associated with
remodeling the environments of cancer cell including
cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion? In
addition, early steps in metastasis are often linked with
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that
allows polarized epithelial cells into isolated, migratory
cells with mesenchymal morphology and characteristics
[102]. Does deregulated MCAK facilitate EMT by
reorganizing cell cytoskeleton, possibly coordinated with
other molecules/signal pathways? Does the front line/
part of cancer tissues express more MCAK? Numerous
questions await answers.
It is intriguing to note that highly expressed
MCAK is linked with invasiveness and metastasis in
colorectal cancer [99]. It is known that more than 80%
of colorectal cancers have inactivating mutations in the
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor suppressor
linked to the initiation and progression of colon cancer
[103,104]. APC participates to the Wnt signaling
pathway by downregulating β-catenin and controlling
gene transcription and cell proliferation. Moreover, APC
plays a key role in directed cell migration by showing its
regulated localization during cell migration and the ability

MCAK IN ONCOGENESIS: ASSOCIATION
OF MCAK WITH CANCER DEVELOPMENT
MCAK is important for proper spindle formation,
correction of aberrant attachments of microtubulekinetochore and for chromosome segregation. To
accomplish this, the activity and localization of
MCAK must be closely regulated by various kinases
and phosphatases in a finely orchestrated manner.
Unfortunately, mitotic kinases and phosphatases can
become unregulated resulting in abnormal mitosis,
chromosome instability and ultimately transformation. By
the same logic deregulation of MCAK may play a role in
cancer development.
Indeed, it has been reported that MCAK is one
of dozens of trans-activated genes in a genome-wide
expression analysis of 81 breast cancer tissues by means of
a combination of cDNA microarray and laser microbeam
microdissection [95]. Further analysis demonstrated
that MCAK is overexpressed in primary breast cancer
tissues as well as in cell lines [96,97]. In addition,
MCAK expression is significantly suppressed by ectopic
introduction of p53 [97], suggesting that highly expressed
MCAK might be involved in breast cancer development.
This elevated expression of MCAK is observed not
only in breast cancer but also in gastric cancer [98],
and enhanced MCAK expression is significantly linked
to lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and poor
prognosis in gastric cancer patients [98]. Furthermore,
this observation is underscored by a study based on
120 colorectal cancer samples: MCAK expression is
significantly higher at both the mRNA and protein levels,
compared to paired corresponding normal tissues, and
this elevated expression level is markedly correlated
with lymph node metastasis, venous invasion, peritoneal
dissemination, Dukes’ classification and poor survival
rate [99]. Recently, this observation has been further
strengthened by a study containing 176 samples derived
from colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, breast and head and
neck cancer tissues [100]. Comparing expression levels
among cancer types, it is noted that MCAK is most strongly
overexpressed in gastric, breast and colorectal cancer and
less pronounced in pancreatic and head and neck cancer.
More recently, MCAK gene has been found to be highly
expressed in glioma samples, which is associated with
histopathological grades [101]. Taken together, the data
highlight that MCAK is aberrantly regulated in cancer
cells and enhanced MCAK levels are associated with
cancer progression, invasiveness, metastasis and poor

to bind multiple polarity proteins and MT-associated
molecules [105]. Interestingly, the APC protein mediates
direct interactions with MTs and the MT plus-end tracking
protein EB1 (end-binding protein 1), which promotes MT
growth through increased rescue frequency and decreased
catastrophe of plus-ends [106]. Interestingly, MCAK has
also been reported to track MT plus-ends [22] and to
co-localize with EB1 at growing MT ends [23]. It will
be interesting to delineate how the plus-end tracking
proteins function in colon cancer cells, with inactive APC
and elevated MCAK, in context of the dynamics of MT
cytoskeleton and cell motility.

Various mechanisms have been implicated in acquired
or secondary taxane resistance [108]. It is reported that
overexpression of MCAK confers resistance to paclitaxel
and epothilone A [109]. It is further demonstrated
that paclitaxel resistant cells resulting from MCAK
overexpression displays a decrease in MT polymer and
an increase in the frequency of MT detachment from
centrosomes [109]. Moreover, loss of MCAK reverses
this aberrantly high frequency of MT detachment and
increases their sensitivity to paclitaxel [110]. The results
indicate that MCAK affects cell sensitivity to paclitaxel
by modulating MT morphology and dynamics.

INVOLVEMENT OF MCAK IN DRUG
RESISTANCE

MCAK AS A POTENTIAL MOLECULE
TARGET FOR CANCER THERAPY

Overexpression of MCAK is not only associated
with malignance progression, but also with drug resistance.
Taxanes, used either as single agents or in combination
with multiple other anticancer agents, are routinely used
for a wide range of solid tumors [107]. Despite their
widespread use, the clinical effectiveness of taxanes is
hampered by its severe side-effects and its resistance,
which ultimately leads to relapse and poor prognosis.

MCAK is also identified as a novel cancer
antigen, suggesting the possibility of cancer specific
immunotherapy [98]. This notion is underscored by a
recent observation that MCAK is capable of inducing
spontaneous T cell responses in vivo resulting in highly
functional MCAK-specific T cells in both patients with
colorectal cancer and healthy donors [100]. MCAK

Figure 2: Summary of MCAK’s involvements in oncogenesis. In gastric, colorectal and breast cancer, MCAK is overexpressed,

which could be contributed by defects in promoter control, mRNA stability and protein turnover, possibly associated with deregulated
kinases/phosphatases in cancer cells. The highly expressed MCAK could result in abnormal spindle formation, erroneous attachment and
failure in chromosome segregation, leading to chromosomal instability and promoting cancer progression. Enhanced MCAK is linked to
invasiveness/metastasis of cancer patients, which could be caused by remodeling MT cytoskeleton and altering cell shape and migration.
Elevated MCAK could reorganize MT morphology/dynamics and contribute to resistance of the MT binding agents. In addition, MCAK
could be considered as a potential target for molecular intervention: either as a novel antigen, provoking immunoreaction of cancer patients,
or as a MT regulator/modulator, in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs.

showing MCAK peptides are able to induce cytotoxic T
lymphocytes to lyse cancer cells in an HLA-A2- or HLAA24-restricted manner [111]. Together, the data imply
that MCAK is possibly a promising target for cancer
immunotherapy for colorectal and gastric cancers.
Targeting mitotic kinesins, such as Eg5, has been
regarded as a promising strategy for cancer therapy [112].
The unique ability of MCAK to regulate MT dynamics
makes it a potential target for development of new drugs
that alter spindle function [113]. It has been shown that
malignant cell lines are more sensitive to depletion of
MCAK, in comparison with normal cells. In addition, MT
interfering drug paclitaxel or vinblastine induces more
cytoskeleton defects in HeLa cells depleted of MCAK
[113]. Moreover, using quantitative immunofluorescence
and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, the
differences in spindle organization is analyzed in cells
treated with low levels of paclitaxel, or with MCAK
inhibition [114]. Interestingly, paclitaxel treatment causes
a disruption in spindle MT organization marked by a
significant increase in MTs near the poles and a reduction in
K-fiber fluorescence intensity, whereas MCAK inhibition
triggers a dramatic reorganization of spindle MTs with a
significant increase in astral MTs and reduction in K-fiber
fluorescence intensity [114]. Moreover, MCAK depletion
promotes dramatic spindle rocking in early anaphase, and
this effect is also observed with taxol treatment [115],
indicative of defects in cytokinesis. These data support the
idea that combination of MCAK suppression with paclitaxel
perturbs synergistically spindle organization, which could
induce severe irreversible mitotic defects, extending
mitotic timing and leading further to mitotic catastrophe
and apoptosis in cancer cells. These studies suggest that
MCAK might be a good target for new drug development,
which could be particularly useful in combination with
currently available anti-microtubule agents. In fact, it is
reported that one form of sulfoquinovosylacylglycerols
(SQAGs) targets the activity of MCAK in cells [116]. It
will be interesting to examine if the p53 status and genome
instability influence its effectiveness [117,118]. Figure 2
illustrates the involvement of deregulated MCAK in tumor
development, invasiveness/metastasis, drug resistance,
and the potential for MCAK as a novel target.

MCAK expression is deregulated in breast, gastric and
colon cancer, which is highly correlated with cancer
progression, invasiveness and metastasis. However, the
molecular mechanisms, which drive high expression
of MCAK in those cancers, are not clear. It will be
interestingly to explore the signal pathways, by which
suppression of MCAK renders resistant cancer cells resensible to taxanes. It is also important to investigate how
overexpression of MCAK increases mobility in cancer cells
and promotes invasiveness and metastasis. In addition,
it will be of interest to examine whether MCAK could
indeed serve as a new target for molecular intervention, as
an antigen for immunotherapy, or as a mitotic regulator in
combination with other agents interfering with mitosis. It
will be also of clinical importance to study the correlation
between abnormal activities of mitotic kinases and
deregulated MCAK activity in primary cancers.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
The finely tuned regulation of MCAK by various
mitotic kinases and phosphatases is essential for the
faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and for
safeguarding genome stability. Current data suggest
MCAK undergoes complex spatiotemporal regulation
during mitosis mainly by Aurora B, coordinated by
other critical mitotic kinases Aurora A, Plk1 and Cdk1/
cyclin B1. Further investigations are required to define
the precise cross-talk networks among these kinases
throughout mitosis and their balance by phosphatases.
