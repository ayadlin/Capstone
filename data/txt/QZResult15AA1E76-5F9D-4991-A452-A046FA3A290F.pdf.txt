ABSTRACT
Oncogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is regulated by a complex
signal transduction network. Single-agent targeted therapy fails frequently due
to treatment insensitivity and acquired resistance. In this study, we demonstrate
that co-inhibition of the MAPK and SRC pathways using a PD0325901 and Saracatinib
kinase inhibitor combination can abrogate tumor growth in NSCLC. PD0325901/
Saracatinib at 0.25:1 combination was screened against a panel of 28 NSCLC
cell lines and 68% of cell lines were found to be sensitive (IC50 < 2 μM) to this
combination. In Snail1 positive NSCLC lines, the drug combination complementarily
enhanced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), increasing both E-cadherin and
Plakoglobin expression, and reducing Snail1, FAK and PXN expression. In addition, the
drug combination abrogated cell migration and matrigel invasion. The co-inhibition
of MAPK and SRC induced strong G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in the NSCLC lines, inhibited
anchorage independent growth and delayed tumor growth in H460 and H358 mouse
xenografts. These data provide rationale for further investigating the combination of
MAPK and SRC pathway inhibitors in advanced stage NSCLC.

at less than 17% [2, 3]. In general, the effectiveness of
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery have been
unsatisfactory, especially in the treatment of advanced
NSCLC [4]. Thus, new treatment strategies that target the
molecular and cellular events underlying the development
of this fatal disease are urgently needed.
The introduction of targeted therapeutics for cancer
treatment in recent years has significantly changed
the practice of medical oncology and many targeted

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
mortality in many countries [1–3]. Approximately 85% of
all lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC),
which can be further subclassified into squamous cell
carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.
Despite significant therapeutic advances made in recent
decades, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer remains

therapeutics are being validated in various stages of
clinical development. Some of these targeted compounds,
such as Gefitinib and Erlotinib, have been approved for
first-line treatment to treat advanced NSCLC harboring
sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations [5, 6]. Unfortunately, these targeted therapies
will eventually limit the effectiveness of traditional
chemotherapies in the metastatic disease due to the
relatively rapid acquisition of drug resistance developed
by the tumor cells [7]. In NSCLC, studies have shown that
secondary mutations (T790M) in the EGFR kinase domain
can promote resistance to EGFR inhibitor treatment [8].
Furthermore, EGFR can crosstalk with other growth factor
receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
(IGF-IR), and reduces the effectiveness of Erlotinib
treatment through the activation of the AKT signaling
pathway [9].
Studies have therefore begun to investigate on the
application of targeted drug combinations to abrogate
signaling pathways cross-talk and restore treatment
sensitivity [10, 11]. For example, Sos et al demonstrated
in NSCLC cell lines that combined blockade of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways
could overcome the reciprocal pathway activation induced
by inhibitor-mediated feedback loops and resulted in
significant increase in apoptosis and tumor shrinkage [10].
Likewise, Legrier et al also showed that combined inhibition
of MAPK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
synergistically suppressed proliferation in NSCLC cell
lines and induced regression of xenograft tumors [11]. Due
to the shear diversity of this topic, it is foreseeable that other
targeted drug combinations may be proven to be effective
and may become viable lung cancer treatments in the future.
Studies have also focused on non-genetic mechanisms
such as Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) as a
cause of tumor cell dissemination and drug resistance in
cancer therapy [4, 12–15]. EMT is a crucial mechanism
for carcinoma progression, as it provides routes for in situ
carcinoma cells to dissociate and become motile, leading
to localized invasion and metastatic spread. Indeed, bone,
brain, lymph nodes, liver and adrenal glands metastases are
a very common secondary localization of disease in lung
cancer patients, with 30–40% of patients developing brain
and bone metastases in the course of their disease [16, 17].
Targeting EMT therefore represents an important therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC exhibiting
highly invasive and metastatic phenotype [14, 15]. We have
hypothesized that some targeted therapeutics, whilst initially
optimized as anti-proliferative agents, may also inhibit EMT
initiation and sustenance, since they are both regulated by
similar signaling pathways that these compounds were
designed to inhibit [15]. However, in-depth investigations
to characterize existing targeted drugs on EMT modulating
properties are still limited to date. We had recently
discovered through a novel cell-based, high-content EMT
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

screening assay, that two targeted compounds, PD0325901
and Saracatinib, selective inhibitors of MEK and SRC
kinases respectively, were also potent EMT modulators that
could interfere with EGF, HGF, and IGF-1 induced EMT
signaling in a NBT-II EMT reporter cell line [14].
In this study, we investigate whether PD0325901
and Saracatinib co-treatment can synergistically
suppress cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in NSCLC
lines. We also evaluate the impact of PD0325901
and Saracatinib in modulating the EMT process via
induction of Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET)
in NSCLC lines. Specifically, we also determine whether
PD0325901 and Saracatinib in combination can induce
strong antitumor and MET response across multiple
NSCLC lines.

RESULTS
Cell proliferation inhibition effects of PD0325901
or Saracatinib single drug treatments on lung
cancer cell lines
We investigated on the proliferation inhibition effects
of PD0325901 and Saracatinib as single drug therapies on
a collection of 28 lung cancer cell lines. We found that only
8 out of 28 cell lines (29%) were sensitive to PD0325901
treatment (cell proliferation IC50 < 2 μM), while 15 cell lines
(54%) were considered resistant to this compound (cell
proliferation IC50 > 10 μM) (Fig. 1A). In general, the growth
inhibition response to PD0325901 varied widely, with cell
lines responding highly sensitively (H1437 and H1666,
IC50 < 50 nM), to cell lines that were highly resistant (H1650
and H2170, IC50 > 100 μM). For Saracatinib single drug
treatment, 9 cells lines (32%) were observed to be sensitive,
while 11 cell lines (39%) were found to be resistant (Fig. 1B).
The growth inhibition response to Saracatinib was observed
to be less varied, with the IC50 ranging from 150 nM
(PC-9) to 33 μM (H460). No correlation between the cell
lines’ sensitivity to these two compounds was observed.

PD0325901 synergized with Saracatinib
co-treatment to reduce cell proliferation in lung
cancer cell lines
We next investigated on the proliferation
inhibition  effects of PD0325901 (PD) and Saracatinib
(AZ) co-treatment on the lung cancer cell lines. We
generated the drug response profiles of three different
PD0325901 / Saracatinib co-treatments at fixed PD:AZ
combination ratios of 4:1, 1:1 and 0.25:1 for each cell line
(Fig. 1C and Supplemental Fig. 1). We then performed
synergism analysis by comparing the growth inhibition
effects of the single drugs to the drug combinations. The
drug combination indices for between the 50%–80%
growth inhibition range were then calculated using the
Loewe Additivity model that had been used extensively

in drug combination studies [10, 11, 14, 18]. We observed
that PD:AZ at 0.25:1 ratio was the optimal drug ratio for
most of the tested cell lines, as the combination ratio tend
to generate more synergistic CI values (Supplemental
Fig.  2). We observed that when PD:AZ at 0.25:1
combination was screened against the cell lines, 19 cell
lines (68%) were now found to be sensitive, and only 1 cell
line (4%) remained resistant to this combination (Fig. 1C).
We also observed that the drug combination performed
synergistically on 26 cell lines (CI < 0.8), with strong
synergism observed on 17 cell lines (CI < 0.5) (Fig. 1D).

PD0325901 and Saracatinib combination treatment had
presented good synergism on these cell lines (Fig.   1D
and Supplemental Fig. 2). Subsequent in vitro combination
studies on these cell lines will be tested at the PD:AZ
optimal drug ratio of 0.25:1, as observed previously.
We first demonstrated that MEK inhibition
by PD0325901 at 1 μM can potently nullify the
phosphorylation of its immediate downstream target
ERK1/2 in these cell lines (Fig. 2). Likewise, we showed
that SRC inhibition by Saracatinib at 4 μM was able to
down-regulate phosphorylation of SRC at Y416 and its
immediate downstream targets FAK at Y861 and PXN
at Y118. We also validated the target selectivity of these
two compounds whereby individually, they could not
down-regulate the phosphorylation of each other’s target
signaling proteins. These results highlighted the potential
advantage of using highly selective compounds in
combinations, whereby modulation of specific targets can
be customized with different drug combination.
We next showed that MET can be effected by both
PD0325901 and Saracatinib in NSCLC cell lines (Fig.  2).

PD0325901 and Saracatinib induced
Mesenchymal-Epithelial transition in Snail1
positive NSCLC lines
To further our investigation on whether PD0325901,
Saracatinib and their combination treatment could induce
MET, we selected 6 cells lines (Calu-1, H23, H358,
H460, H838 and H1373) which exhibited positive basal
EMT transcription factor Snail1 expression. In addition,

direct targets ERK and SRC, and modulating EMT-related protein markers (E-cadherin and Plakoglobin epithelial markers; and Snail1,
FAK and PXN mesenchymal markers). β-actin shown as loading control.

We observed that different cell lines exhibit different
degrees of MET response against the two compounds
individually. For example, PD0325901 induced a stronger
down-regulation of Snail1 in H838 as compared to
H358 line, while Saracatinib induced a stronger Snail1
down-regulation in H358 compared to H838. Similar
observations were also found when comparing the
individual drug induced E-cadherin changes between
Calu-1 and H1373 lines. Overall, we consistently observed
a down-regulation of Snail1 expression, in concordance
with the up-regulation of both E-cadherin and Plakoglobin
epithelial markers in the drug treated samples compared
to untreated control, indicative of MET induction [19].
Interestingly, we observed that the drug combination
together can complementarily enhance MET induction,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increasing both E-cadherin and Plakoglobin expression,
and further reducing Snail1, FAK and PXN expression
in the cell lines, compared to the single drug treated
conditions.

PD0325901 and Saracatinib increased
E-cadherin and Plakoglobin expression and
localization at the cell-cell contacts
We conducted immunofluorescence staining
experiments to further analyze the MET induction
response through quantifying and comparing the
functional expression and localization of E-cadherin
(Fig. 3A) and Plakoglobin (Fig. 3B) in untreated
and drug treated H358 and H1373 cell lines.

Morphologically, we immediately observed that the
drug treated cells exhibited increased cell compactness
compared with untreated cells. Consistent with the
findings above, we observed that both PD0325901 and
Saracatinib single treatments could increase E-cadherin
and Plakoglobin expression, with drug combination
treatment showing the most significant increase in
expression levels (E-cadherin 1.92 ± 0.30 fold and
Plakoglobin 1.49 ± 0.13 fold in H358 line; E-cadherin
1.68 ± 0.17 fold and Plakoglobin 1.62  ±  0.17 fold in
H1373 line), compared to untreated controls. We also
observed that both PD0325901 and Saracatinib single
treatments and the drug combination treatment to an

even greater extent could induce a higher degree of
localization of E-cadherin and Plakoglobin at the cellcell contacts, as compared to controls.

MET induction by PD0325901 and Saracatinib
reduced cell migratory and invasive behavior
We further performed cell migration (scratch) assays
and Boyden chamber Matrigel invasion assays on these
cell lines to determine whether the MET induction by
PD0325901 and Saracatinib could promote a functional
response by limiting the cell migratory and invasive
behavior. Both PD0325901 and Saracatinib induced

MET were able to significantly reduce the cell migratory
behavior of the cell lines compared with untreated
controls (Fig. 4A; Fig. 4B). In particular, we observed
that Saracatinib treatment itself was very effective in
reducing cell migration. We attributed this to the fact
that Saracatinib potently nullified the phosphorylation
of FAK and PXN via disruption of the FAK-SRC-PXN
signaling cascade (Fig. 2), and both FAK and PXN played
vital roles in cell motility through regulation of focal
adhesion dynamics [20]. Interestingly, the combination
treatment was observed to be the most effective in further
limiting the migratory potential of H23, H358 and H1373
cell lines.
For invasion assay, Matrigel-invasive cell lines
Calu-1, H23 and H838 were tested (Fig. 4C; Fig. 4D). We
observed that both PD0325901 and Saracatinib induced
MET were effective in reducing the cell invasive behavior
of these cell lines, despite exhibiting differential antiinvasive sensitivity in response to either of the drug.
Nevertheless, the combination treatment was shown to
be the most potent in abrogating cell invasion in these
cell lines (0.06 ± 0.04 for Calu-1, 0.07 ± 0.04 for H23
and 0.12 ± 0.05 for H838, relative to their respective
untreated controls). These functional studies highlighted
the complementary inhibitory effects of the PD0325901 /
Saracatinib combination treatment.

cell lines responding with IC50 < 1 μM (Supplemental Table
1). This correlates with the strong cytostatic growth arrest
effect exerted by PD0325901 in the NSCLC lines, as shown
previously (Fig. 5A). The PD0325901 and Saracatinib
combination treatment was also effective in suppressing
anchorage-independent colony growth. Interestingly, we
analyzed that the combination treatment can substantially
reduce the effective IC50 of Saracatinib, without increasing
the effective IC50 of PD0325901 in the combination.
The drug combination was also observed to act mostly
synergistically on Calu-1, H23 and H460 and additively on
H1373.

PD0325901 and Saracatinib delayed tumor
growth and induced E-cadherin expression in
xenograft tumors
We evaluated the single and combinatorial effects of
PD0325901 and Saracatinib co-treatment in vivo in H460 and
H358 xenograft models, using doses previously documented
to result in therapeutically-relevant concentrations [21, 22].
Tumors-bearing mice were randomized and administered
with vehicle control, PD0325901 or Saracatinib alone, or
with PD0325901 / Saracatinib combination. H460 and H358
tumors in the vehicle control group grew rapidly during the
course of the experiment, reaching 29.6 ± 7.2 and 13.6 ±
5.8 tumor volume fold change respectively at assay end
point. Saracatinib treatment alone resulted in moderate
delay in both H460 and H358 tumor growth (21.7 ± 3.0 and
10.8 ± 8.5 tumor volume fold change respectively), while
PD0325901 alone or combination treatments resulted in
substantial tumor growth inhibition in H460 tumors (7.10 ±
1.5 and 7.20 ± 2.0 tumor volume fold change respectively)
and tumor regression in H358 tumors (0.95 ± 0.33 and 1.07
± 0.29 tumor volume fold change respectively) (Fig. 6A;
Fig. 6B; Fig. 6C). Minimal weight loss was observed
in the mice in all treatment groups, suggesting that this
combination strategy was well-tolerated (data not shown).
We observed through immunohistochemistry
staining that E-cadherin expression was significantly
induced in the H460 tumors treated with PD0325901 or
Saracatinib, compared with vehicle control. Interestingly,
the PD0325901 / Saracatinib combination treatment also
induced a moderately higher induction of E-cadherin,
compared with the single drug treatments (Fig. 6D;
Fig.  6E). We further confirmed from the whole tumor
lysates that E-cadherin expression was increased in
PD0325901, Saracatinib and drug combination treated
tumors, compared with vehicle control (Fig. 6F).

PD0325901 and Saracatinib exerted
predominantly cytostatic growth arrest in
NSCLC lines
We next investigated on how cell cycle progression
was regulated by PD0325901 and Saracatinib in these
NSCLC lines. Cell-cycle analysis from Propidium Iodide
staining experiments indicated that both PD0325901
and Saracatinib exerted predominantly cytostatic effect
and induced significant G1-phase accumulation in the
cell lines (Fig. 5A; Fig. 5B). In particular, we observed
that PD0325901-treated cells in general exhibited a very
strong G1-phase accumulation and S-phase depletion as
compared with Saracatinib-treated cells. Interestingly,
PD0325901 and Saracatinib combination treatment were
observed to maintain or further augment the G1-phase
accumulation in the cell lines tested.

PD0325901 and Saracatinib combination
suppressed anchorage-independent colony
growth in NSCLC lines
For the cell lines (Calu-1, H23, H460 and H1373) that
were able to grow under anchorage-independent conditions
in soft agar assays (Supplemental Fig. 3), we observed that
Saracatinib treatment alone can only modestly inhibit colony
growth, with only Calu-1 responding with IC50 < 1 μM.
PD0325901 treatment alone, on the other hand, was potent
in reducing anchorage-independent colony growth, with all

respectively  can  be broadly effective in tumor growth

survival and invasion pathways, which leads to the
aberrant growth of tumors. The active SRC pathway
has also been documented in upwards of 50% of tumors
derived from several cancers, including NSCLC [23].
Therefore, this potential target has been extensively
investigated in NSCLC, and over the past decade, several
clinical studies have evaluated the use of selective
SRC inhibitors such as Saracatinib for treating NSCLC
[24–27]. However, although Saracatinib was well tolerated
in cancer patients and reduction in tumor SRC activity was
observed in phase I trial [24], it was later shown to be
ineffective as single agent therapy, as objective responses
to Saracatinib were not observed in phase II trials in
NSCLC [25] as well as other cancers [26, 27]. Our in vivo
experiments also confirmed that Saracatinib treatment
alone only resulted in modest growth delay with no tumor
shrinkage (Fig. 6).
Likewise, the MAPK signaling cascade also plays
critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
survival, differentiation, motility, and angiogenesis.
It serves a pivotal role in oncogenesis and growth of
transformed cells, and investigations on blocking the
MAPK pathway via MEK inhibitors such as PD0325901
have come to the forefront as an exciting approach in
cancer therapeutics [28]. However, although PD0325901
demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical xenograft
models [29] and preliminary clinical activities on
melanoma and NSCLC patients in phase I trial [30], the
phase II study on patients with advanced NSCLC failed
to show any objective responses [31]. Due to lack of
responses coupled with the safety issues, current studies
focus on PD0325901 schedule and the use of rational
combination strategies [31, 32]. Our study suggests
that SRC and MEK co-inhibition by Saracatinib and
PD0325901 can be a proof-of-concept treatment strategy
since the combination acts mostly synergistically in
inhibiting cell proliferation across a wide panel of NSCLC
cell lines (Fig. 1). In addition, we show that PD0325901
can be co-administered at a lower dose ratio compared to
Saracatinib, which may circumvent the dose safety issues
related to PD0325901.
The role of EMT as one of the important nongenetic mechanisms that drives tumor cell dissemination
and drug ineffectiveness to cancer therapy has been
intensively researched [12–15]. The extent of EMT
across various cancers has recently been reported to vary
widely, highlighting the heterogeneity of cancers [33]. We
hypothesize that treatments that modulate the EMT status
of tumors towards a more defined state (i.e. epithelial state)
may reduce the metastatic aggressiveness of the cancer
and make the tumors more susceptible to conventional
chemotherapy. It is well-accepted that a repertoire of
dysregulated signaling pathways is responsible for the
induction of EMT in cancers [34–36]. In addition, the
development in targeted therapeutics to treat pathways

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

driven cancers have rapidly revolutionized anti-cancer
therapies [37, 38]. However, the EMT modulating properties
of many clinically tested targeted drugs have not been
validated in human cancers. Our previous high-throughput
screening study to identify EMT modulators had uncovered
several targeted compounds (PD0325901 and Saracatinib
among them) that could potently interfere with growth
factor induced EMT signaling [14]. In this study, we further
validate that both PD0325901 and Saracatinib are potent
EMT modulators and individually, each compound can
differentially induce a MET response in Snail1 positive
NSCLC cell lines. Although the mechanisms driving these
differential MET still remains to be elucidated, overall, we
show that the PD0325901 and Saracatinib combination can
effectively be used in combination to strongly drive cancer
cells towards a more epithelial state through up-regulation
of E-cadherin across most of the NSCLC lines tested. This
is consistent with findings by two other groups whereby
inhibiting both SRC and MEK signaling suppressed
the invasive growth and cellular survival of tumor cells
[39,  40]. Importantly, we verified that high E-cadherin
expression is associated with poor migratory activity in
NSCLC cells (Supplemental Fig. 4A; 4C). Although there
are controversial reports that show a correlation between
high E-cadherin expression with aggressive and metastatic
growth in breast and ovarian tumors, the differential
impact of E-cadherin expression on invasive growth in
different organ types needs further investigation [41, 42].
Furthermore, we show that the high E-cadherin expression
did not activate other reciprocal pathways like AKT and
MAPK signaling pathway (Supplemental Fig. 4B; 4D).
This suggests that PD0325901 and Saracatinib combination
serves as a favorable therapeutic strategy that induce MET
in NSCLC cells yet overcoming the activation of reciprocal
pathways prevalent in drug resistance.
In conclusion, we demonstrate through biomarker
expression and functional studies that MET can be
enhanced in NSCLC lines when PD0325901 and
Saracatinib are used in combination. We also demonstrate
that PD0325901 synergized with Saracatinib co-treatment
to reduce cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in NSCLC
lines. These data support further preclinical and clinical
development of combining SRC and MAPK pathways
inhibition to treat advanced stage NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
All lung carcinoma cell lines except PC-9 were
obtained directly from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) repository. The PC-9 cell line was
a gift from A. Ali (CSI, Singapore). Cell lines were
authenticated by DNA short tandem repeats analysis
using GenePrint 10 kit (Promega). The cell lines were

30000

Oncotarget

maintained in RPMI-1640 (Nacalai Tesque) growth
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, HyClone, Thermo Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine
(Gibco, Life Technologies) and 100 U/ml penicillinstreptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies) at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere.

Protein concentration was quantified and equalized protein
loads were resolved with Bio-Rad SDS-PAGE system
using 8% to 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting were performed with
the antibodies listed above and bound antibodies were
detected by chemiluminescence using Amersham ECL
Prime Western Blotting reagent (GE Healthcare).

Cell proliferation assay and synergism analysis

Immunofluorescence imaging

Saracatinib (AZ) and PD0325901 (PD) were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Cells were plated
into microtiter culture plates (Greiner) and treated with
varying concentrations of PD or AZ alone, or drug
combinations at fixed PD to AZ ratios. After 72 h, cells
were lysed with CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability
assay reagent (Promega) and luminescence was read using
a microplate reader (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan). Percent
cell proliferation was calculated relative to DMSO control
treated cells.
Sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting for each
treatment condition were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism 5 software. Drug concentrations that result in cell
proliferation inhibition of between 50% and 80% (i.e. IC50
to IC80) for each treatment condition were then calculated
and tabulated for synergism analysis.
Combination index (CI) for PD and AZ combination
was calculated based on the Loewe Additivity equation
[18]. Briefly, for a cell growth inhibition effect of Ey:

Cells were plated into black, clear bottom 96-well
microtiter plates (Greiner). When the cells reach about
50% confluency, the cultures were then treated with
compounds or DMSO as control. After 48 h treatment,
cells were gently rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized
with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Samples were then
blocked with blocking buffer (2% FBS, 0.3% Triton-X
in PBS) for 30 min, followed by immunostaining with
E-cadherin (1:500) and Plakoglobin (1:500) primary
antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Samples
were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary
antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies)
for 2 h at 25°C, followed by Hoechst 33342 nuclear
staining (1:2000, Sigma) for 15 min. The wells were then
washed and kept in PBS. The plates were sealed with
aluminum sealing films (Axygen, Fisher Scientific) and
stored at 4°C prior to fluorescence imaging.
Plates were imaged using a confocal microplate
imager (MetaXpress Ultra, Molecular Devices) with
40× objective, 405 nm laser / 417–477 nm filter cube
configuration for nuclei imaging, and 488 nm laser /
525/50 nm filter cube configuration for E-cadherin and
Plakoglobin imaging. At least 8 sites were imaged for
each well. Image sets were analyzed with ImageJ software
using an image processing workflow described previously
[14, 43]. Object segmentation was performed and the
E-cadherin or Plakoglobin fluorescence intensity of each
cell was quantified. Fluorescence intensity of compound
treated cells was calculated relative to DMSO control
treated cells.

where dPD and dAZ are the respective combination
doses of PD and AZ that will achieve y% cell growth
inhibition effect; DPD and DAZ are the corresponding single
doses for PD and AZ to result in the same effect; and r is
the PD:AZ concentration ratio in the drug combination.
The CI values for between 50% to 80% growth inhibition
effect, CI(E50–80), was tabulated for the drug combination
treatment on each cell line.

Western blots

Cell migration assay

E-cadherin antibody was purchased from BD
Biosciences. Plakoglobin and Paxillin (PXN) antibodies
were purchased from Millipore. Antibodies against
Snail1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2),
phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2, SRC, phospho-SRC (pY416),
focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phospho-PXN (pY118),
phospho-Akt (pS473), β-actin and HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Phospho-FAK (pY861) antibody was
purchased from Thermo Scientific.
Cells are grown on 6-well plates and treated with
compounds or DMSO as control for 48 h. Cells were
rinsed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease / phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Promega).

Cells were plated into 6-well plates and grown to
confluency. A 200 μl pipette tip was used to make linear
scratches on the cell monolayer. The wells were then
gently washed with media to remove unattached cells and
refreshed with culture media containing test compounds
or DMSO control. Suitable areas centered on scratch
regions with appropriately 0.60 - 0.75 mm wound gap,
were selected for wound closure observation. Images of
selected areas were acquired at 0 h (T1) and at the end of
the cell migration experiment (T2: 36 h for Calu-1, H23,
H838 and H1373; and 72 h for H358), using an optical
imaging microscope at 4× magnification (Olympus
CKX41/C-5060). The wound gap area for each image
30001

Oncotarget

Tumor xenograft

was measured using ImageJ software. For each T1 and T2
image set, the wound closure percentage was calculated
using the formula: (AreaT1 − AreaT2) / AreaT1 × 100%.

All animal work adhered to the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines
on animal use and handling. Female athymic BALB/c
nude mice between 6 to 8 weeks old were maintained and
handled in a pathogen-free environment under controlled
conditions and received food and water ad libitum.
Subconfluent H460 or H358 cells were resuspended in
PBS at 40 × 106 cells/ml, and 0.1 ml cell suspension was
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of each animal.
The tumors were measured with vernier calipers twice a
week and the volume was calculated using the modified
ellipsoidal formula (length × width2)/2. Median tumor
size at initiation of drug treatment was 50 mm3 (for H460
cells) and 200 mm3 (for H358 cells). Both PD and AZ
were prepared in 1% polysorbate 80 (Sigma). The mice
were randomized into four groups of five mice and gavage
fed with vehicle control, or 12.5 mg/kg PD, or 50 mg/kg
AZ, or 12.5 mg/kg PD and 50 mg/kg AZ combination. All
drugs were administered once a day, 5 days a week. The
mice were euthanized and the xenograft tumors harvested
after 3 weeks of drug treatment.

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion assay was performed using 8 μm pore,
24-well format transwell inserts (Corning). Transwell
membranes were coated with 0.1 ml of 0.25 mg/ml matrigel
(BD Biosciences) in PBS and incubated overnight at 37°C.
The following day, 40 × 103 cells in 1% FBS culture media
were seeded into each transwell insert, while 0.5 ml of 10%
FBS culture media containing test compounds or DMSO
control was added into the lower chambers. Following a 48
h incubation to allow cell penetration, non-invaded cells in
the transwell insert were removed using cotton swab and
the invaded cells on the membrane underside were fixed
with methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in PBS
and air dried. For each membrane, five non-overlapping
brightfield images were acquired with an optical imaging
microscope at 4× magnification (Olympus IX71/DP71).
The number of cells in each image was then counted using
ImageJ software. Percent cell invasion was calculated
relative to DMSO control treated cells.

Immunohistochemistry

Cell cycle analysis

Xenograft tumors from control and compounds
administered mice were fixed in formalin immediately
after surgical excision, and subsequently paraffin
embedded and sectioned. Tumor sections were
deparaffinized using standard histologic procedures and
stained with E-cadherin antibodies. Color development
was performed using EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB)
kit (Dako, Agilent Technologies) according the
manufacturer’s recommendation. Cell nuclei were
counterstained with Hematoxylin (Thermo Scientific).
Slide images were acquired with an optical imaging
microscope at 20× magnification (Olympus IX71/DP71).
Images were acquired from 3 tumor samples each for
every treatment group.
Images were analyzed with ImageJ software using
an image processing workflow described previously [43,
44]. Briefly, Hematoxylin and DAB stain color-separated
images were derived from the original image using
ImageJ Color Deconvolution plugin. Object segmentation
using the Particle Analyzer plugin was then performed
to identify the individual cellular regions in the image
and the DAB intensity of each cell region in the image
was then tabulated. E-cadherin staining was analyzed as
the percentage of E-cadherin positive cells in each slide
image. At least 20 images were analyzed for each tumor
sample.

Cell cycle fractions were determined through
propidium iodide (PI) nuclear staining. Briefly, cells are
grown on 6-well plates and treated with compounds or
DMSO as control for 48 h. Cells were then harvested, fixed
with 70% cold ethanol, and stained with PI staining buffer
(0.03 mg/ml PI, 0.1 mg/ml RNAse A, 0.1% Triton-X in
PBS) for 30 min at 25°C. Flow cytometry was performed
using BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). At
least 10,000 cell events were collected per sample. Cell
cycle analysis was performed using FlowJo software
(Tree Star).

Anchorage independent assay
0.5 ml of cell suspension in 0.36% agarose
containing culture media was plated into each well on
the top of existing 0.6% bottom agarose in 24-well
tissue culture plates. 0.5 ml of culture media containing
compound or compound combinations at various doses
was then loaded into each well. Plates are incubated in
a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for a period of 2 - 4 weeks to
allow cell colonies to grow large enough to be visualized
through MTT tetrazolium dye staining. At the assay
endpoint, 0.04 ml of 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) were
added into each well and further incubated at 37°C for
3 h. Cell colony images of each well were acquired using
a flatbed scanner (Epson). The number of colonies formed
in each well was then quantified using ImageJ software.
Percent cell colony formation was calculated relative to
DMSO control treated cells.
