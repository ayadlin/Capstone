ABSTRACT
Despite of highly effective new therapeutic strategies, chemotherapy still is an
important treatment option in metastatic melanoma. Since predictors of chemotherapy
response are rare, drugs and regimens are currently chosen arbitrarily. The present
study was aimed at the identification of molecular markers predicting the outcome of
chemotherapy in melanoma. Tumor biopsies from metastatic lesions were collected
from 203 stage IV melanoma patients prior to chemotherapy onset and used for gene
expression profiling (n = 6; marker identification set), quantitative real-time PCR
(n = 127; validation set 1), and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (n = 70;
validation set 2). The results were correlated to the tumors’ in vitro chemosensitivity
and to the patients’ in vivo chemotherapy outcome. SERPINB1 was found to correlate
to the in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens (p = 0.005).
High SERPINB1 gene expression was associated with favorable tumor response
(p = 0.012) and prolonged survival (p = 0.081) under cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
High SERPINB1 protein expression in tumor tissue from cisplatin-treated patients
was associated with a favorable survival (p = 0.011), and proved as an independent
predictor of survival (p = 0.008) by multivariate analysis. We conclude, that SERPINB1
expression, although not functionally involved, is predictive for the outcome of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy in melanoma, and thus may be useful to personalize
melanoma chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

in randomized phase-3 trials [1, 2], a result which
has never been successfully shown before for any
systemic therapeutic. Before this new era of targeted
agents, the standard treatment of metastatic melanoma
was chemotherapy. Herein, monochemotherapy with
dacarbazine (DTIC) served as standard first-line
treatment, while combination chemotherapy, mainly
with cisplatin-based regimens, was used in second-line
therapy. After the astonishing results of the new
drugs, it was assumed that the era of chemotherapy
in melanoma was over. Nevertheless, chemotherapy

Therapy of metastatic melanoma is currently
undergoing a rapid and radical structural change. This
is due to two newly developed groups of therapeutics,
inhibitors attacking the mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinase pathway like vemurafenib, dabrafenib,
and trametinib, and immune checkpoint blockers
like ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab.
Agents from both groups were able to demonstrate a
prolongation in overall survival of melanoma patients

of melanoma is not outdated; it still plays an important
role, but in other patient settings than before [3, 4].
This is particularly in patients not harbouring a druggable
MAP kinase pathway mutation, or in patients who are
mutation-carriers but are not or no longer responding to
the respective targeted agents. Moreover, chemotherapy is
indicated in patients who are not suitable or not responding
to immune checkpoint blockers. Thus, chemotherapy was
switched from a primarily first-line to a mainly second- or
higher line treatment strategy. However, this renders it
not less important for the standard of care of metastatic
melanoma, and still most melanoma patients with distant
metastasis receive one or more lines of chemotherapy
sooner or later during their course of disease.
Thus, to improve the outcome of chemotherapy in
melanoma it is of high importance to stratify patients into
both, groups of high or low probability to benefit from
chemotherapy, and subgroups of selected chemotherapy
agents or combination regimens for patients with high
probability to respond. Such a personalized treatment
strategy would be of particular importance since
chemotherapy has up to now been shown repeatedly not to
prolong patient survival if applied in an unselective mode
[5, 6]. The new inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway
imply the advantage, that the patient population with a
high probability to respond can be easily identified by
testing the tumor tissue for the druggable mutation. Thus,
the presence of these mutations can be simultaneously
used as drug target and as biomarker of therapy response
[7, 8]. For chemotherapy, in contrast, predictive
markers helping to stratify patients for specific drugs or
regimens are not known. Thus, the choice of mono- or
combination chemotherapeutics for melanoma is therefore
currently made arbitrarily. We recently demonstrated in
a phase-2 trial, that the in vitro chemosensitivity profile
determined from fresh tumor tissue can be used for the
stratification of melanoma patients for different groups
of chemotherapeutic regimens [9]. Moreover, in those
patients who were subsequently treated with a sensitivitydirected chemotherapy, the respective chemosensitivity
measured for each tumor correlated to treatment response
and patient survival [9].
In the present study we aimed at the identification
of molecular markers predicting the outcome of
chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma. For this
purpose, we first performed a gene expression profiling
of melanoma cell lines established from tumor tissue
biopsies taken before the onset of chemotherapy, in order
to identify genes which are differentially expressed in
tumor cells from chemotherapy responders compared to
non-responders. From the resulting list of differentially
expressed genes, five candidates were chosen for
further validation. For this purpose, we analyzed
tumor cells isolated from tissue biopsies of metastatic
melanoma lesions for their in vitro chemosensivity
towards a panel of chemotherapeutics as single agents
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or combinations. Parts of these tumor tissue biopsies
were used to analyze the expression of the candidate
genes in two independent validation sets, either on
transcriptional level in cryopreserved tissue samples
(validation set 1), or on protein level by tissue microarray
immunohistochemistry analysis of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded samples (validation set 2). The findings resulting
from these experiments were correlated to the in vitro
chemosensitivity of the corresponding tumors, as well as
to the clinical outcome of the first subsequent therapy in
the corresponding patients.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
203 stage IV melanoma patients were subject of
chemosensivity testing and subsequent workup of banked
biomaterials throughout this study. This total population
consisted of three independent sets of patients: six patients
were investigated based on cell line materials (marker
identification set), 127 patients were investigated based
on cryopreserved tissue materials (validation set 1), and
70 patients were analyzed based on FFPE tissue samples
(validation set 2) (Table 1, Figure 1). 62 patients from
validation set 1, and 34 patients from validation set 2
participated in clinical multicenter trials of sensitivity-directed
chemotherapy ([9]; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00779714).

Differentially expressed genes in chemosensitive
versus chemoresistant tumors
Tumor cell lines established from metastatic lesions
of six melanoma patients biopsied for chemosensitivity
testing were analyzed by gene expression profiling using
the Affymetrix microarray technology. Three cell lines
(MaMel-067, MaMel-105, MaMel-113) originated from
tumor lesions which presented a clinical response (PR),
and three (MaMel-061h, MaMel-062, MaMel-071) were
from lesions not responding (PD) to sensitivity-directed
chemotherapy (Figure 2). Also, the responders showed
lower values for best CSI, reflecting a higher in vitro
chemosensitivity, than the non-responders (Figure 2).
Gene expression profiling revealed 42 genes as more than
two-fold up-regulated (Table 2) and 76 genes as more
than two-fold down-regulated in melanoma cell lines
derived from responders compared to non-responders
(Supplementary Table 1). Five candidate genes, lysyl
oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1), secernin 1 (SCRN1), vesicleassociated membrane protein 5 (VAMP5), serine protease
inhibitor clade B member 1 (SERPINB1), and thymosin
beta 4 X-linked (TMSB4X) were chosen from the list
of up-regulated genes by their extent of expression
difference and their potential function in chemosensivity/
chemoresistance (Table 2). The gene expression data of
SERPINB1 for each tested cell line is depicted in Figure 2.

SERPINB1 gene expression correlates with
in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin-containing
chemotherapy

Thus, all tested regimens containing cisplatin were
significantly associated to SERPINB1 expression, whereas
vindesine showed an association as a monotherapeutic only,
and not in combination regimens. The expression of the
other tested candidate genes LOXL1, SCRN1, VAMP5, and
TMSB4X did not correlate to the in vitro chemosensitivity
to any of the tested drugs.

qPCR quantification of the relative expression
of the five candidate genes LOXL1, SCRN1, VAMP5,
SERPINB1, and TMSB4X in cryopreserved tumor
tissues from validation set 1 was correlated to the CSIs
measured in the corresponding fresh tissue samples
of the same tumor lesions. This analysis revealed that
SERPINB1 expression was associated with the in vitro
chemosensitivity to cisplatin (p = 0.028; N = 82), vindesine
(p = 0.019; N = 82), cisplatin + paclitaxel (p = 0.0033;
N = 127), and cisplatin + gemcitabine (p = 0.033; N = 82).
SERPINB1 expression was not correlated to the in vitro
chemosensitivity to doxorubicin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine,
treosulfan, gemcitabine + treosulfan, gemcitabine +
vindesine, and doxorubicin + paclitaxel (data not shown).

SERPINB1 gene expression predicts clinical
outcome of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
The relative expression of SERPINB1 as measured
by qPCR in cryopreserved tumor tissues from validation
set 1 was correlated to the patients clinical outcome.
Overall survival was first analyzed in all patients with
known clinical follow-up data (n = 120; see Table 1),
comprising all therapy types of the first regimen following
chemosensitivity testing (chemotherapy, immunotherapy,

we found no association between SERPINB1 relative
expression and survival (p = 0.96); however, low
values of the best CSI, i.e. CSIs ≤ 100 reflecting a high
chemosensitivity, were significantly associated (p = 0.043)
with a favorable survival in this patient group (Figure 3A).
With regard to the subset of patients treated with a
chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin (n = 27),
patients with high SERPINB1 expression (> median = 0.88)
demonstrated a favorable survival, which did however not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.081; Figure 3B). The
best CSI showed no significant impact on survival in this
subgroup (p = 0.12; Figure 3B). Multivariate Cox analysis
of overall survival in this patient subset revealed serum
LDH as the only independent predictor (p = 0.016; HR =
11.28; 95%-CI = 1.56–81.32), followed by CSI cisplatin +
paclitaxel (p = 0.21; HR = 0.37; 95%-CI = 0.08–1.74),

SERPINB1 relative expression (p = 0.49; HR = 0.69; 95%CI = 0.24–1.97), ECOG performance status (p = 0.75;
HR = 1.27; 95%-CI = 0.29–5.63), and M category (0.99;
HR = 1.00; 95%-CI = 0.29–3.42). Tumor response to therapy
was grouped as responders (CR/PR/SD) and non-responders
(PD). In the subset of patients treated with a cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, responders showed significantly higher
SERPINB1 relative expression levels than non-responders
(p = 0.012; Figure 3C). In the total patient population, there
was no significant association of SERPINB1 expression with
therapy response (data not shown).

(p = 0.27; Figure 4B), whereas in the subset of patients
treated with a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen
(n = 22), high expression scores of SERPINB1 were
associated with a favorable survival (p = 0.011; Figure 4C).
In contrast, the subset of patients treated with DTIC
monochemotherapy revealed no difference in survival
when stratified based on SERPINB1 protein expression
(p = 0.96; Figure 4D). Multivariate analysis of overall
survival in this patient subset revealed SERPINB1
expression score (p = 0.008; HR = 0.098; 95%-CI
= 0.018–0.54) and M category (p = 0.048; HR = 19.19; 95%CI = 1.03–356.77) as independent predictors, followed by
serum LDH (p = 0.084; HR = 10.96; 95%-CI = 0.73–165.41),
gender (p = 0.23; HR = 2.89; 95%-CI = 0.52–16.03),
CSI cisplatin + paclitaxel (p = 0.61; HR = 0.44; 95%-CI
= 0.02–10.14), and ECOG performance status (p = 0.87;
HR = 1.16; 95%-CI = 0.20–6.58). With regard to in vitro
chemosensitivity, the total patient population showed no
correlation between best CSIs and SERPINB1 expression
scores (p = 0.47; Figure 4B), whereas in patients treated
with cisplatin-based regimens low values of the respective
CSI correlated with high values of the SERPINB1
expression score (p = 0.025; Figure 4C). In patients treated
with DTIC, no correlation was found between SERPINB1
expression and chemosensitivity (p = 0.89; Figure 4D).
Tumor response was not significantly associated with the
SERPINB1 expression score in any of the patient subsets.

Changes in SERPINB1 expression do not
functionally impact cisplatin chemosensitivity

SERPINB1 protein expression correlates with
in vitro sensitivity and clinical outcome of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy

Our analyses revealed a correlation between
SERPINB1 expression and both in vitro sensitivity to and
clinical outcome of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Hence,
we tested whether this correlation could also be observed
experimentally. To this end, five melanoma cells lines
with different baseline expression of SERPINB1 were
rendered more chemoresistant by cultivating them for six
weeks with increasing amounts of cisplatin. SERPINB1
mRNA expression was determined before and after these
long-term cisplatin cell culture experiments. In four of
the five cell lines the prolonged culture with increasing
doses of cisplatin resulted in reduced SERPINB1

To validate SERPINB1 as a predictor of the outcome
of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, an independent
set of patients and respective tumor samples was
selected (validation set 2; n = 70; see Table 1). In these
samples, SERPINB1 expression was detected on protein
level by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays
and quantified by an expression score (Figure 4A).
In the whole patient population (n = 70) the SERPINB1
expression score had no significant impact on survival

expression levels (Figure 5A). Only in one cell line with
the lowest SERPINB1 baseline level (WueMel-45), a
slight increase in SERPINB1 expression was observed
after long-term culture with cisplatin. Notably, prognostic
and predictive markers might either be merely associated
or influence prognosis or outcome directly by their
function for the cells. Consequently, we determined the
effect of SERPINB1 expression on cisplatin sensitivity
in melanoma cells. First, we transduced three melanoma
cell lines with two different inducible SERPINB1-specific
shRNA vectors. Upon addition of doxycyclin, SERPINB1
expression was almost completely abolished in all cell
lines (Figure 5B). However, when sensitivity to cisplatin
was measured by MTS assays, no obvious difference could
be observed between control and SERPINB1 knockdown
cells (Figure 5C).

and survival are rare. Hatch and coworkers just described
the expression of the endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 to be
associated with the outcome of oxaliplatin chemotherapy
in melanoma [20]. In melanoma cell lines, the authors
demonstrated that high XPF and ERCC1 protein levels
correlate with low sensitivity to oxaliplatin. However, in
tumor tissue samples from melanoma patients, the authors
found no association between XPF protein expression
and clinical response to platin-based therapy regimens.
Another recent study demonstrated the O6-methylguanineDNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation
status determined by PCR in tumor tissue from primary
melanomas as a predictive marker of response to
temozolomide, an oral derivative of DTIC [21]. Moreover,
low MGMT protein expression levels were associated with
response to temozolomide. In 2010, Parker and coworkers
analyzed FFPE tissues from melanoma patients for a panel
of 93 genes associated with chemoresistance by qPCR
array technology, and correlated their findings with the
in vitro chemosensitivity measured by the same
methodology as in our present study (ATP-TCA) on
fresh tissue samples of the corresponding patients [22].
They found HSP70, EGFR, and several genes involved in
apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell proliferation as common
genes associated to chemoresistance towards different
cytotoxic agents. SERPINB1 was not identified as
associated to chemoresistance in this study.
SERPINB1 is a member of the large family of
serine proteinase inhibitors, the serpins, which also exhibit
functions unrelated to inhibition of catalytic activity, such
as transport and other mechanisms [23]. SERPINB1 is
located intracellularly, and is ubiquitously expressed. As
an inhibitor of the neutrophil elastase, it was formerly
called monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor. SERPINB1
is functional in inflammation and complement activation
[24], and has been shown to be involved in neutrophil and
megakaryocyte development, as well as in the inhibition
of the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B [23].
The role and specific function of SERPINB1 in
cancer biology is largely unknown. SERPINB1 protein
has recently been identified by gel electrophoresis
and subsequent mass spectrometry to be differentially
expressed in gastric and lung carcinoma, respectively,
as compared to healthy tissues [25, 26]. Two studies
described SERPINB1 as a dose-dependent potent
suppressor of metastasis in terms of invasion and
migration in oral squamous cell carcinoma, and in lung
and breast cancer, respectively [27, 28]. In these cancer
entities, it has been shown that SERPINB family members,
particularly SERPINB1, –B5, and –B7, are differentially
expressed in tumor tissues compared to matched normal
tissues from the same patients [28]. An overexpression
of each of these three genes effectively suppressed the
invasiveness and motility of cancer cells. Interestingly, this
inhibitory effect was further enhanced by co-expression of
any two of them.

DISCUSSION
Predictive markers of chemotherapy outcome
in melanoma are rare, and most of those available are
analyzed in animal or cell line models only with no
regard to clinical data or patient materials. Several
serological markers like LDH, S100B, different cytokines,
pro-angiogenic factors, and many other molecules are
known to be associated with chemotherapy outcome.
However, these markers in the first instance are prognostic
and not predictive, and therefore are of no help to select
patients for specific treatment strategies, or to choose
the optimal chemotherapy drugs and regimens. Out of
this panel of prognostic serum markers, the most widely
investigated one is LDH. Melanoma patients with LDH
serum levels beyond normal values are associated with an
unfavorable overall survival, and also with non-response
and poor progression-free survival under different
regimens of chemotherapy [10–13]. However, other
therapy strategies like immunotherapy or targeted agents
have also been shown to reveal poor response rates and
shortened survival times in patients with elevated serum
LDH at treatment start [13–15]. In our present study,
the patients’ serum LDH was measured before treatment
onset as a routine for prognostic reasons. As expected, we
found a strong association of elevated LDH levels with an
impaired survival, with no association to type or specific
regimen of therapy (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus,
the LDH serum level does not help to select for therapy
strategies or to individualize chemotherapy in melanoma.
Tumor tissue-based driver mutations in genes like
BRAF or MITF might be of high impact for the treatment
outcome of targeted therapies, but do not correlate with
chemotherapy outcome [16, 17]. Other tumor tissue-based
molecular markers have been analyzed for their predictive
impact for chemotherapy outcome in melanoma in
preclinical models only [18, 19]. Studies of molecular
markers analyzed in biomaterials from melanoma patients

Up to now, SERPINB1 expression and function has
not been attributed to chemosensitivity and chemotherapy
outcome. However, the expression of another member
of the serpin family, SERPINB3, together with a second
proteinase inhibitor cystatin C, was demonstrated as
independent predictors of response to platin-based
chemotherapy in NSCLC [29]. Herein, the authors suggest
a role of SERPINB3 in the regulation of lysosomal
protease-mediated cell death. Indeed, SERPINB3 has
been shown to be a negative regulator of programmed cell
death in tumor cell lines in response to cytotoxic drugs
and ionising radiation [23]. In the current study, however,
knockdown of SERPINB1 did not impact chemosensitivity
suggesting that some other factor responsible for
chemosensitivity influences SERPINB1 expression.
Taken together, we demonstrated in the present
study that gene expression profiling from melanoma
tissue is a useful tool to identify differentially

expressed genes distinguishing chemosensitive from
chemoresistant tumors. From five identified candidate
genes, only one revealed a strong correlation to
in vitro chemosensitivity and clinical chemotherapy
outcome by experimental validation in two independent
sample sets. Interestingly, the predictive association to
in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity could be confirmed
for cisplatin-containing regimens only. The protein
expression of this candidate gene, SERPINB1, proved
as a strong and independent predictor of survival after
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Interestingly, all other
chemotherapy regimens analyzed, as well as other
therapy strategies like immunotherapy, showed no
association to SERPINB1 expression. Thus, our results
clearly show, that SERPINB1 expression in tumor tissue
is not prognostic, like the majority of the already tested
potentially predictive markers, but predictive only. This
advantage emphasizes SERPINB1 as a useful marker

Chemosensitivity testing

predicting the outcome of cisplatin-based chemotherapies,
and may help to personalize chemotherapy of melanoma.
Notably, melanoma cell lines under long-term treatment
with increasing doses of cisplatin revealed a reduction
of SERPINB1 expression. However, knockdown of
SERPINB1 expression by shRNA did not influence
cisplatin sensitivity in melanoma cell lines.
In conclusion, patients showing strong SERPINB1
protein expression in tumor tissue are likely to benefit
from cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens;
vice versa, a low tissue protein expression of this marker
would suggest the corresponding patient to be spared a
cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to the low probability
of response. To confirm the feasibility of SERPINB1
as a biomarker for the personalization of melanoma
chemotherapy, these findings should be validated within
prospective clinical trials.

Chemosensitivity testing was performed using
a non-clonogenic ATP-based luminescence assay
(ATP-TCA, DCS Innovative Diagnostic Systems,
Hamburg, Germany) as previously described [9].
Briefly, the freshly obtained tumor tissues were minced,
enzymatically dissociated to single-cell suspensions, and
depleted of red blood cells and debris by Ficoll-Hypaque
density gradient centrifugation. This cell suspensions were
given into polypropylene round-bottom 96-well plates
(2 × 104 cells/well) with or without different
chemotherapeutic agents at increasing dilutions (6.25%,
12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%) of individual test drug
concentrations (TDC), each tested in triplicates. The drugs
and TDCs used were cisplatin 3.8 µg/ml, doxorubicin
0.5 µg/ml, vindesine 0.5 µg/ml, paclitaxel 13.6 µg/ml,
gemcitabine 12.5 µg/ml, and treosulfan 20 µg/ml, tested
individually or in combinations. After seven days of
incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity, the
cells were lysed and the ATP content of the lysate was
quantified by a luciferin-luciferase luminescence reaction
using a microplate luminometer (Berthold Detection
Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Cell suspensions
incubated without chemotherapeutic agents were used as
control. Chemosensitivity indices (CSIs) ranging from 0 to
600 were calculated for each test drug or drug combination
by summing up the percentages of cell viability at the
six drug concentrations tested [32]. Thus, a CSI of 600
indicates full cell viability/minimal drug sensitivity,
whereas a CSI of 0 reflects complete cell death/maximal
drug sensitivity. Best CSI was defined as the lowest CSI
of all drugs and combinations tested for a tumor sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and biomaterials
The tumor samples analyzed in this study were
collected from patients with histologically confirmed
metastatic melanoma, who were biopsied for the purpose
of in vitro chemosensitivity testing on fresh tumor tissue.
Tissue biopsies were taken from metastatic lesions. The
native tumor tissue was cleared from connective and fatty
tissues and subsequently subjected to chemosensitivity
testing. Residual parts of this tumor tissue were used
for either cryopreservation, histopathology, or cell
culture. Staging of the patients’ disease was done
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) classification of 2009 [30]. Patient and tumor
characteristics at the time of chemosensitivity testing
were extracted from the patients’ files. Also, data of the
first therapy regimen after in vitro testing and its outcome
were documented. Therapy regimens were categorized
into chemotherapies (all regimens containing at least one
chemotherapeutic), immunotherapies (vaccinations, IFNalpha, IL-2), and other/supportive therapies (sorafenib,
doxycyclin, tamoxifen, pamidronate, supportive
therapeutics). Individual chemotherapy regimens were
selected either sensitivity-directed or by physicians choice.
Tumor response was assessed by CT and/or MRI imaging
and evaluated according to RECIST [31]. Best response
was defined as the best response recorded from start of
treatment until disease progression. Overall survival
(OS) of the patients was determined from treatment
onset until death; otherwise the date of last patient
contact was used as the endpoint of survival assessment
(censored observation). Collection of biomaterials as well
as documentation of clinical data were performed after
patients’ informed consent and with Institutional Review
Board approval (Würzburg 82/07 and 123/08).

Cell culture and gene expression profiling
Permanently growing melanoma cell lines were
established from residual tissue specimen derived from
biopsies taken for chemosensitivity testing. These as
well as the established melanoma cell lines A375, FM
88, and SKMel 28, were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), 5 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The obtained cell
lines were used for analysis after at least six culture
passages. Cell lines were chosen for gene expression
profiling by Affymetrix chip technology by the clinical
response of the corresponding patients to sensitivitydirected chemotherapy. Total RNA was isolated from
2 × 106 cells with commercially available purification
kits (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and thereafter
subjected to a second clean-up by a silica-gel-based
membrane using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Concentrations of DNA and RNA were

10128

Oncotarget

measured by UV spectrophotometry and OD 260/280
nm ratios between 1.9 and 2.1 were obtained for all RNA
samples. 400 ng of total RNA isolated from each cell
line was used to check for integrity on Bioanalyzer 2100
System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Sample
preparation and hybridisation was done as described
before [33]. Thereafter, samples were loaded on Human
HG-U133A 2.0 micro-arrays (Affymetrix, Sunnydale, CA)
comprising 22,277 sequences. Image analysis and pairwise comparison of expression profiles between cell lines
from responders and non-responders were performed with
the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) as
described before [33].

The expression of each target gene was normalized to that
of the housekeeping gene RPLP0. Relative expression
levels were calculated by the ∆∆Ct method using LIVAk
KJ as calibrator [34]. Five melanoma cells lines established
from biopsies taken for chemosensitivity testing were
treated over six weeks with increasing concentrations of
Cisplatin (1 µM to 10 µM). RNA isolated from cells at
the start and end of the treatment period were subjected to
real time PCR to determine relative expression levels of
SERPINB1 calibrated to Wue45 untreated.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
For histopathology, representative parts of the tumor
tissue biopsies were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE), and thereafter stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H + E) as well as with melanoma-specific markers
(HMB45, Melan-A/MART-1) for diagnosis confirmation.
Representative tumor areas were marked on H + E-stained
slides. Thereafter, three 0.6 mm punch cores were taken
from the corresponding areas on the FFPE blocks and
inserted into grids on new paraffin blocks by use of the
manual tissue arrayer MTA-1 (Beecher Instruments, Sun
Prairie, WI, USA). 5  µm sections were cut from these
tissue microarrays (TMAs) and stained for SERPINB1
using specific antibodies (HPA018871, Sigma Aldrich,
Munich, Germany; dilution 1:500). Three independent
investigators who were blinded to the clinical data
examined these slides. SERPINB1 staining intensity was
graded as no (-/0), weak (+/1), moderate (++/2), and strong
(+++/3) staining. The percentage of SERPINB1-positive
cells among all tumor cells of each core was graded as
0% (0), 1 – 50% (1), and 51% – 100% (2) positive cells.
The sum of staining intensity and percentage of positive
cells was defined as SERPINB1 expression score, and
ranged from 0 to 5. For each tumor, an average was
calculated from the scores of all tissue cores available.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Five genes showing significant expression
differences between responders and non-responders
in micro-array analysis were assessed on mRNA level
by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). For RNA
isolation from 1.5 × 106 cells or 25–50 20 µm sections
of cryopreserved tissues the PeqGOLD Total RNA kit
(Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, cDNA was
synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using the Superscript
II Reverse Transcriptase cDNA Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). For real-time PCR the Absolute qPCR Low ROX
Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used
following the manufacturer’s protocol. A 20 µl reaction
contained 1 µl cDNA, 300 nM of forward and reverse
primer and 100 nM of the respective dual-labelled probe.
The standard thermal profile of the 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR machine (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany)
was applied. Primers and probes were designed with
locations in different exons using the software Primer
Express 3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Primers were: LoxL1_sense TGC CAG TGG ATC GAC

SERPINB1 knockdown
Knockdown of SERPINB1 was realized by an
inducible lentiviral shRNA vector based on a system
previously described [35]. Two different shRNA
sequences targeting SERPINB1 were cloned into the
vectors 289: GGA GCG TCT TAT ATT CTG AAC TCG
AGT TCA GAA TAT AAG ACG CTA, and 1219: AGT
GCT TTA TTA CCT GAG TTC TCG AGA ACT CAG
GTA ATA AAG CAC T. Melanoma cells were transduced
by lentiviral particles produced in HEK293T [36] and
selected by puromycin addition four days after infection.
For induction of shRNA expression cells were treated
for four days with doxycyclin (1 µg/ml). Knockdown of
SERPINB1 was confirmed by immunoblotting with an
anti-SERPINB1 antibody (HPA018871, Sigma Aldrich);
ACTIN (ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served as
loading control. The effect of SERPINB1 knockdown on

the sensitivity to cisplatin was determined by MTS assays.
In brief, melanoma cells transduced with SERPINBspecific shRNA vectors were seeded in 96 well plates.
To half of the wells doxycyclin was added. The next day
all wells received the appropriate cisplatin concentration,
i.e. 0%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100% or 200% TDC.
After three days of culture, the metabolic activity was
measured as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega,
Mannheim, Germany). The percentage of inhibition was
calculated as (valueuntreated – valuetreated)/ valueuntreated.

Survival curves and median survival times were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method for censored
failure time data. The log rank test was used for comparison
of survival probabilities between groups. The proportional
hazards model of Cox was used to identify independent
predictors of survival testing candidate markers in
adjustment with the relevant clinical covariates gender
(male versus female), M category (M1a/b versus M1c),
ECOG performance status (0 versus ≥ 1), serum LDH
(≤ UNL versus > UNL), and CSI (≤ 100 versus > 100).
The proportional-hazard assumption was tested based
on Schoenfeld residuals. Linear regression was used to
detect correlations between CSIs and marker expressions.
Student’s t test was used to compare groups of therapy
response. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant and were not corrected for multiple testing.
