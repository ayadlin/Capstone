Abstract
Inhibition of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is an
attractive noncytotoxic approach to cancer therapy. MMP-14,
a membrane-bound zinc endopeptidase, has been proposed to
play a central role in tumor growth, invasion, and neovascularization. Besides cleaving matrix proteins, MMP-14
activates proMMP-2 leading to an amplification of pericellular
proteolytic activity. To examine the contribution of MMP-14
to tumor growth and angiogenesis, we used DX-2400, a highly
selective fully human MMP-14 inhibitory antibody discovered
using phage display technology. DX-2400 blocked proMMP-2
processing on tumor and endothelial cells, inhibited angiogenesis, and slowed tumor progression and formation of
metastatic lesions. The combination of potency, selectivity,
and robust in vivo activity shows the potential of a selective
MMP-14 inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(4):1517–26]

Inhibition of MMPs has been extensively pursued as a
therapeutic strategy for treating cancer, generally using compounds containing zinc-chelating groups such as hydroxamates.
MMP intervention strategies have met with limited clinical success
with severe toxicities (12, 13) in that prolonged treatment with
broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors caused musculoskeletal pain and
inflammation (14, 15). The mechanism of these toxicities is
assumed to be due to the poor selectivity of these compounds. It
is now recognized that among the MMP family, some possess
cancer-promoting activities whereas others have tumor-inhibiting
functions (16), underlining the risk of using broad-spectrum MMP
inhibitors. In fact, broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors promote
metastasis of breast carcinomas as well as lymphomas to the liver
in mice (17, 18).
High selectivity is essential for realizing the clinical potential of
MMP inhibitors. Using a human Fab displaying phage library, we
have identified a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MMP-14,
providing us with the opportunity to assess the preclinical
pharmacology of this MMP inhibitor.

Introduction
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 (MT1-MMP) is a membrane-bound MMP that plays a critical role in conferring cells with
the ability to remodel and penetrate extracellular matrix (1). MMP14 drives invasion by functioning as a pericellular collagenase (2)
and an activator of proMMP-2 (3, 4), and is directly linked to
tumorigenesis and metastasis (5–7). MMP-14 null mice display
impaired basic fibroblast growth factor–mediated corneal angiogenesis (4), and tissues from the same mice fail to show
angiogenesis in a type I collagen ex vivo model, supporting a
potential role of MMP-14 in angiogenesis as well (8).
High MMP-14 expression is associated with early death of breast
cancer patients (9) and is correlated with lymph node metastases,
progression, invasion, poor clinical stage, larger tumor size, and
increasing tumor stage (10, 11). Taken together with the multiple
lines of preclinical evidence linking MMP-14 to cancer progression,
there is a strong case for targeting MMP-14 in cancer.

Materials and Methods
Phage Display Library Selections and Screenings
MMP-14 catalytic domain (MMP-14-CD; R&D Systems) was biotinylated
using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and used as the target for selection against our human Fab library FAB310.
Selections and Fab-phage ELISA were carried out essentially as described
(19). Fabs were reformatted into whole human IgG1s (hIgG1) as described
previously (20). DX-2400 was stably expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary
cells and purified using protein A, a 15S resin, and MEP HyperCell mixed
mode resin (PALL Life Science). The percent aggregation was <5% and
contaminants including protein A, dsDNA, host cell proteins, and
endotoxins were below detectable limits.

MMP Inhibition Assays
DX-2400 was tested for MMP-14 inhibitory activity using a fluorescent
peptide substrate Mca-Lys-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dap(Dnp)-Ala-Arg-NH2 (M2350, Bachem). The proform of the mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey
MMP-14 without the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were
cloned, expressed in insect cells, and purified.
K i and apparent K is (K i app) were computed from inhibition curves
(initial velocities versus DX-2400 concentrations) at different substrate
concentrations (5–50 Amol/L) using the Morrison equation (21). The K i
values were calculated from K i app versus substrate concentration ([S])
curves and the competitive relationship between K i app and [S] ½Ki app ¼
ð1 þ K½Sm Þ (22).

The inhibitory activities of anti–MMP-14 Fabs and IgG1s toward other
human MMPs and tumor necrosis factor-a converting enzyme (TACE) were
examined. MMP and TACE enzymatic activities were monitored using
enzyme-specific peptide substrates in the absence or presence of 1 to
10 Amol/L anti–MMP-14 IgG1n antibodies. Two broad-spectrum MMP
inhibitors, GM6001 (Millipore Corp.) and Marimastat (Tocris Biosciences),
were used as controls.

Cell-Based Assays and Gelatin Zymography
Cell culture. HT-1080, MDA-MB-231, and BT-474 cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection and cultured according to the
vendor’s guidelines. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with plasmid encoding
green fluorescent protein (MDA-MB-231-GFP) were maintained in culture
as described (23). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
freshly isolated from umbilical cords and cultured on gelatin-coated culture
dishes in RPMI 1640 with 25 mmol/L HEPES supplemented with EGM
SingleQuots (Cambrex Bio Science), 200 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, and 10% FCS. For some experiments, HUVECs were
purchased from Lonza. HUVECs were used between passages 3 and 6.
Western blot analysis. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from
cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Equal amount of
proteins (30 Ag) was resolved by 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was probed with a
rabbit polyclonal antibody to MMP-14 (Abcam) followed by a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Proteins were detected using a SuperSignal West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blot was
subsequently stripped and reprobed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to
h-actin (Abcam) followed by a HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunoprecipitation, an equal amount of
cell lysates (1 mg) was incubated with 5 AL of anti–MMP-14 antibody and
20 AL of protein G beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4jC. After washing,
beads were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting
as described above except that a mouse anti–MMP-14 antibody (R&D
Systems) was used as the primary antibody.
Gelatin zymography. HT-1080 cells (2  105) and HUVECs (2  105)
were grown for 24 h in complete medium. After two washings in PBS,
HT-1080 cells were treated with a broad range of DX-2400 concentrations,
GM6001 (10 Amol/L), or a nonneutralizing polyclonal anti–MMP-14
antibody (R&D Systems; 67 nmol/L). Conditioned medium from HT-1080
cells was collected after 48 h of culture in serum-free UltraCulture medium
(Cambrex Bio Science). After 4 h of starvation in EBM-2 basal medium,
HUVECs were stimulated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 (10 ng/mL) and either control IgG1 antibody (6.7 nmol/L) or DX-2400
(6.7 nmol/L). Conditioned medium was collected after 16 h of culture, and
gelatinolytic activities in 10-fold concentrated conditioned media (Centricon YM-30 columns, Millipore) were analyzed by gelatin zymography (24).
Chemoinvasion assays. In vitro invasive properties of HUVECs were
assessed using polycarbonate filters with 8 Am pore size, coated with
growth factor–depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences). HUVECs were serum
starved for 4 h in EBM-2 basal media and washed twice in PBS containing
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The upper part of the chamber was filled
with HUVECs (5  104) treated with either DX-2400 (6.7 nmol/L) or control
IgG1 (6.7 nmol/L) in EBM-2 basal medium. The bottom part of the chamber
was filled with EBM-2 medium supplemented with either 0.5% serum
(control) or 0.5% serum with VEGF (10 ng/mL) along with control IgG1
(6.7 nmol/L) or DX-2400 (6.7 nmol/L). Anti-VEGF antibody (R&D Systems;
6.7 nmol/L) was used as a positive control. After 18 to 22 h of incubation at
37jC, invasive cells were stained with DiffQuick staining solution (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and filters were mounted onto glass slides. The number of
cells that had migrated per membrane from three random fields was
counted using a brightfield microscope connected to a Spot digital camera
(Diagnostic Instruments).
Tube formation assay. HUVECs were seeded at a density of 2  104
per well on the top of a Matrigel layer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines (BD Labware). Culture medium was added to each well in the
presence or absence of a dose range of DX-2400. Suramin (Calbiochem)

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

was used as a positive control. Cells were incubated at 37jC with 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator for 16 to 18 h. Total tube length in the
photomicrograph was quantified using angiogenesis tube formation
application module in Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Tube
formation of untreated HUVECs was used as a negative control. The
assay was done twice in triplicate with IC50 values determined using
SigmaPlot 8.0.
Fibrin gel bead assay. Fibrin gel bead assay was done as described (25).
Briefly, HUVECs were mixed with dextran-coated cytodex-2 microcarriers
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and treated with control IgG1 or DX-2400
for 4 h. The coated beads were then embedded in a fibrin clot and
incubated with EBM-2 complete medium in the presence or absence of
indicated concentrations of control IgG1 (67 nmol/L) and DX-2400 (0.67,
6.7, and 67 nmol/L). Anti-VEGF antibody (67 nmol/L) was used as a positive
control. Medium and treatment were renewed every other day. After 7 d,
beads were fixed and photographed. The migration distance was calculated
for three random areas per bead, and data were represented as an average
of eight beads. The migration distance was normalized to percent
migration, with migration to control alone representing 100%.

Xenograft Models
Detailed protocols are described in Supplemental Data and Supplementary Table S1.
Analyses of the presence of GFP-positive cells in ectopic organs.
Fresh lung and liver tissues were cut (1 mm thick) for direct examination by
fluorescent microscopy for the presence of GFP-expressing tumor foci. The
number of foci per field of examination was counted from 10 random sites
of five different slides for each organ.
Evaluation of DX-2400 concentration in mouse serum. DX-2400
concentrations in mouse serum were measured using an electrochemical
luminescent binding assay. Streptavidin-coated plates were used to capture
biotinylated rabbit anti–DX-2400 antibody. DX-2400 standard and blinded
serum samples were incubated with the coated plate at a minimum
required dilution of 1:80. Unbound DX-2400 was washed off and bound DX2400 was detected with ruthenylated rabbit anti–DX-2400 antibody. The
detection limits using this assay ranged from 125 to 8,000 ng/mL in neat
mouse serum, with intersample percent of coefficient of variability <20%,
and percent nominal of control samples falling between 75% and 125% at or
below the minimum required dilution of 1:80.
Gelatin-based film in situ zymography. Tissue cryosections were dried
at room temperature and incubated in TCNB buffer with 20 Ag/mL of
gelatin quenched substrate (Invitrogen). GM6001 (100 Amol/L) was used as
a control. After an overnight incubation at 37jC, the substrate was washed
out with MilliQ water. Gelatinolytic activity appeared green on a black
background.
Immunohistochemistry studies. Cryosections were fixed with ice-cold
acetone, blocked with 10% goat serum and 10% BSA, and incubated with
rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse (human) CD31 IgG (Abcam; 1:50). AlexaFluor
488 goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen; 1:400) was used as a secondary
antibody. Rabbit IgG (DakoCytomation) was used as a negative control.
For competition experiments, cryosections were preincubated with DX2400 (2 Ag/mL) in the presence of 100 molar excess of human
recombinant MMP-14 protein (R&D Systems) or cynomolgus monkey
MMP-14. Slides were incubated overnight with biotinylated DX-2400
(2 Ag/mL) and then treated with streptavidin/HRP (1:200), and signals
were visualized with AEC+ chromogenic substrate (DakoCytomation) and
counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Ltd.).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance of the differences was analyzed by single-factor
ANOVA or Student’s t test.

Selective Human Antibody Inhibitor of MMP-14

the human MMP-14-CD as a target. Approximately 1,500 individual
isolates were screened on purified MMP-14-CD by protein-based
ELISA, and a total of 347 MMP-14-CD binders were identified (21%
hit rate). Seventy were distinct as determined by DNA sequencing,
with 12 of these being found to inhibit MMP-14 activity. The Fabs
all had IC50 values <10 nmol/L and were reformatted into hIgG1s
for further characterization. Six of these IgG1s inhibited MMP-14
activity with IC50 values V5 nmol/L, with each possessing different
profiles of inhibition of related MMPs. One of these antibodies,
DX-2400 (IgG1n), potently inhibited human MMP-14 (K i = 0.8
nmol/L) following a competitive model (Fig. 1A). DX-2400 also
inhibited mouse (K i = 0.3 nmol/L), rat (K i = 0.2 nmol/L), and
cynomolgus monkey (K i = 4 nmol/L) MMP-14. DX-2400 did not
inhibit activity of a panel of secreted human MMPs or TACE at the
highest concentration tested, 1 Amol/L, in contrast to GM6001 and
Marimastat (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, DX-2400 did
not inhibit the other MT-MMPs (MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-17, and
MMP-24) at concentrations up to 10 Amol/L.
MMP-14 is highly expressed in invasive cancer cell lines and
endothelial cells. We first assessed the expression of MMP-14 in a
number of cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-474

breast cancer cells; HT-1080 fibrosarcoma; and B16F1 melanoma
cells) and endothelial cells (HUVECs) by Western blot analysis. As
shown in Fig. 1B, the anti–MMP-14 antibody detected a major
protein of 63 kDa in MDA-MB-231 cells, corresponding to
proMMP-14. A specific band of 57 kDa, which represents a
processed form of MMP-14 (26), was detected in MDA-MB-231,
HUVECs, and HT-1080 cells. As previously shown by others (27),
the poorly invasive human breast cancer cells MCF-7 lacked
baseline MMP-14 protein expression even after immunoprecipitation whereas BT-474 and murine B16F1 cells showed faint bands of
63- and 57-kDa forms, respectively (data not shown).
Selective inhibition of MMP-14 activity blocks proMMP-2
processing. HT-1080 cells, which express MMP-14 and MMP-2,
were used to assess the effect on MMP-2 activity by the selective
inhibition of endogenous MMP-14 by DX-2400. DX-2400 blocked
proMMP-2 processing, whereas a polyclonal rabbit anti–MMP-14
antibody, which does not inhibit MMP-14 activity, failed to inhibit
proMMP-2 activation (Fig. 1C). GM6001 (K i of 13.4 nmol/L against
hMMP-14) also inhibited proMMP-2 activation but increased
proMMP-9 secretion by >2.5-fold as compared with the vehicle
control, whereas DX-2400 did not induce this effect (Fig. 1C).

DX-2400 inhibited proMMP-2 activation (Fig. 1D) with an IC50
value in this assay of f5 nmol/L. DX-2400 also reduced HT-1080
cell invasion in vitro by 40% to 45% (data not shown).
Selective inhibition of MMP-14 impairs migration and
invasion of endothelial cells in vitro. DX-2400 inhibited HUVEC
tube formation (IC50 f6 nmol/L; Fig. 2A) and inhibited migration
of HUVECs in a fibrin gel bead assay (60% in the presence of
DX-2400 as compared with a control IgG1; Fig. 2B) whereas
proliferation was unaffected (data not shown). DX-2400 also
inhibited VEGF165-induced invasion of HUVECs (Fig. 2C).
To determine whether selective inhibition of endogenous MMP14 by DX-2400 might be responsible for blocking MMP-2 activation
in endothelial cells, we assessed the presence of active forms of
MMP-2 in conditioned medium of VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs. In
unstimulated endothelial cells, MMP-2 was present in its precursor
and active forms (Fig. 2D). On VEGF165 stimulation, the 62-kDa
active MMP-2 significantly increased in intensity (Fig. 2D). In the
presence of DX-2400, no active MMP-2 was detected in both
unstimulated HUVECs and VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs (Fig. 2D).

Selective inhibition of MMP-14 activity inhibits primary
tumor growth in MDA-MB-231, but not MCF-7, breast cancer
xenograft mouse models. We next evaluated the activity of DX2400 in the MDA-MB-231 s.c. xenograft model. MDA-MB-231 is a
highly aggressive HER2-negative human breast adenocarcinoma
cell line expressing high levels of MMP-14 (Fig. 1B). DX-2400
monotherapy showed a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth (Fig. 3A) with the higher doses of DX-2400 (10 and
30 mg/kg) yielding tumor growth inhibitions of 76% and 70%,
respectively. Doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg also showed activity in this
model (48% and 59% tumor growth inhibitions). DX-2400
treatment led also to a significant reduction of tumor vascularization (CD31-staining; Fig. 3A, insets). To determine the DX-2400
concentrations necessary to elicit the direct effects on tumor cell
growth in this model, we measured serum DX-2400 levels at day 10,
day 20, and at study termination. Pharmacokinetic measurements
made at study termination showed that DX-2400 mean serum
concentrations correlated to the doses administered (Fig. 3B;
mean serum antibody concentration of 38 F 7, 140 F 47, and

697 F 263 Ag/mL for the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg treatment groups,
respectively). Similar results were observed at day 20. DX-2400
serum concentrations <110 Ag/mL were measured at day 10 at the
highest dose (30 mg/kg) tested. We further sought to evaluate the
effect of treatment regimen on tumor growth. For this purpose,
DX-2400 was administered at four different schedules. At study
termination, the q2d schedule dose yielded a significant tumor
growth inhibition of 73%, with the q3d, q4d, and q7d schedules
also showing activity (59%, 44%, and 46% tumor growth
inhibitions, respectively; Fig. 3C).
In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cells, MCF-7 cells do not express
MMP-14 (Fig. 1B; ref. 27) and are poorly tumorigenic in nude mice.
In addition, their capacity to develop tumors in vivo is not affected
by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 or batimastat (28).
Consistent with the lack of MMP-14 expression in MCF-7 cells,
DX-2400 failed to inhibit MCF-7 tumor xenograft growth, in
contrast to tamoxifen (Fig. 3D).
DX-2400 significantly decreases tumoral MMP activity. We
next investigated the activity of DX-2400 in an orthotopic

(mammary fat pad implantation) MDA-MB-231 xenograft model.
MDA-MB-231-GFP tumor–bearing animals were treated with DX2400 for 4 weeks. Administration of DX-2400 resulted in a 75%
primary tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 4A). We examined the
expression and activity of tumoral MMPs in DX-2400–treated
animals. Specifically, we measured MMP-14 expression by
immunohistochemistry, total tumoral MMP activity using a
peptide substrate cleavage assay, gelatinolytic activity using
gelatin film-in situ zymography, and proMMP-2 activation using
gelatin zymography. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that
DX-2400 binding in DX-2400–treated tumors was significantly
reduced (Fig. 4B), reflecting the high exposure of the tumors to
our antibody. Enzymatic activity assays using a peptide substrate
cleaved by a wide range of MMPs (including MMP-2 and
MMP-14) on clarified supernatants extracted from tumor tissues
revealed 70% less MMP activity in the tumors from DX-2400–
treated animals as compared with the control IgG1-treated
group (Fig. 4C). This inhibition reached f90% when a high
concentration of GM6001 was exogenously added. Thus, chronic

administration of DX-2400 significantly decreased total MMP
activity in tumor tissue, and the MMP activity in MDA-MB-231GFP tumors is largely mediated by MMP-14. Gelatin-based film
in situ zymography on tumor sections showed a dramatic
reduction of gelatinolytic activity in DX-2400–treated animals
(Fig. 4D, top). Gelatin zymography on the tumor extracts
revealed a significant reduction in active MMP-2 from DX2400–treated animals (Fig. 4D, bottom), showing that the
reduction of gelatinolytic activity observed by gelatin-based film
in situ zymography in the DX-2400–treated tumors may be
attributed to a reduction of MMP-2 activity.

To evaluate the effect of DX-2400 on MDA-MB-231-GFP tumor
metastases in the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic model, lung and liver
tissues were removed at the end of the study, and the presence of
GFP-positive tumor foci was assessed. Tumor-bearing animals
treated with DX-2400 at the highest dose (10 mg/kg) developed
significantly fewer metastatic foci in the lungs and livers as
compared with animals treated with control IgG1 (Fig. 5A).
To investigate the direct effects of DX-2400 on pulmonary
metastasis, an i.v. model was used using murine B16F1 melanoma
tumor cells. In this model, tumors arise in the lung after systemic

extravasation following i.v. tail vein injection of tumor cells. DX2400 treatment decreased the number of metastatic lung foci in a
dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximal effect (70%) at the
highest dose tested (10 mg/kg; Fig. 5B).
Concurrent administration of DX-2400 with paclitaxel
increases tumor growth delay in the BT-474 xenograft model.
We next sought to evaluate DX-2400 activity in the HER2–
positive human ductal breast carcinoma model, BT-474. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of DX-2400
alone or in combination with paclitaxel. BT-474 tumors in the
PBS-treated group reached the 1,000 mm3 end-point volume in a
median time to end point of 33.6 days (Fig. 6A). Treatment of
BT-474 tumor-bearing animals with paclitaxel or DX-2400
monotherapy resulted in median time to end point of 50.5 and
59.6 days, respectively, corresponding to 16.9-day (50%) and
26-day (77%) tumor growth delays. Concurrent administration of
DX-2400 plus paclitaxel resulted in median time to end point of
73.3 days corresponding to 39.7 days of tumor growth delay
(118%). Thus, DX-2400 showed activity against HER2–positive

BT-474 tumors when used as a single agent or in combination
with paclitaxel, producing a significant increase in antitumor
activity in this model.
DX-2400 and bevacizumab combination increases tumor
growth delay in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Both
bevacizumab and DX-2400 have antiangiogenic activity, but they
act by different mechanisms. Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF
humanized antibody that has direct effects on endothelial
proliferation through inhibition of VEGF binding and activation
of VEGFR-2, whereas DX-2400 inhibits endothelial migration, in
part, through a blockade of proMMP-2 activation. We evaluated the
combination of DX-2400 with anti-VEGF therapy for possible
augmentation of antitumor activity. The combination of DX-2400
with bevacizumab slowed tumor progression to a greater extent
than did DX-2400 alone or the combination of control IgG1 with
bevacizumab. Tumors from PBS- or control IgG1-treated mice
reached the predefined size of 1,500 mm3 in an average of 37.5 and
44.6 days, respectively. Bevacizumab increased the time to end
point to a similar extent as DX-2400 alone (f18 days), whereas the

combination of DX-2400 with bevacizumab delayed tumor growth
for an additional for 13 days (Fig. 6B).
Gelatin-based film in situ zymography on MDA-MB-231 tumor
sections showed a 3-fold increase of gelatinolytic activity in the
tumors from bevacizumab-treated animals (Fig. 6C). DX-2400
completely abolished this effect, consistent with our in vitro
findings that blocking MMP-14 activity inhibits VEGF-induced
proMMP-2 activation.

Discussion
The expression of MMP-14 correlates with the malignancy of
different tumor types (29, 30), and its overexpression in tumor cell
lines enhances their invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo
(5, 31). Therefore, MMP-14 is an important target for the
development of a highly selective MMP inhibitor for cancer
treatment.
We herein describe the identification and characterization of
DX-2400, a potent and highly selective human antibody inhibitor of
MMP-14 activity. DX-2400 efficiently blocked proMMP-2 activation
and displayed anti-invasive activity in vitro. Despite their ability to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

block tumor cell invasion in vitro , some MMP inhibitors
paradoxically increase MMP-9 expression (32), which could
stimulate tumor formation and increase the number of liver
metastases (18). Treatment of HT-1080 cells with GM6001
increased MMP-9 secretion whereas DX-2400 did not, thus showing
the importance of drug specificity within the MMP family.
MMP-14 is involved during both physiologic and pathologic
angiogenesis (33, 34). DX-2400 inhibited angiogenesis, in part,
through inhibition of VEGF-driven cell invasion and proMMP-2
activation. The resulting antiproteolytic activity of DX-2400 may
limit matrix component degradation, resulting in decreased
endothelial cell invasion and angiogenesis.
Our in vivo studies show that DX-2400 markedly affected tumor
growth of MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 tumors when used as a single
agent or in combination. In contrast, this compound did not alter
the growth of MCF-7 (MMP-14 negative) derived tumors, showing
MMP-14 dependency for DX-2400.
In the MDA-MB-231 model, the antitumor effect of DX-2400 was
associated with a strong decrease in tumor vascularization. DX2400 treatment also induced a significant reduction of MMP
activity, supporting an antiproteolytic effect of this antibody.

DX-2400 showed in vivo activity at all dosing schedules tested, with
q2d schedule yielding the highest efficacy. In addition to its effects
on primary tumor growth, DX-2400 also significantly reduced the
number of metastatic foci in vivo.
DX-2400 showed activity against the HER2–positive BT-474
xenografts when used as a single agent or in combination with
paclitaxel. These results make DX-2400 an attractive candidate
for breast cancer patients, especially in cases where hormonal
therapy and/or therapy with Herceptin (trastuzumab) is not
effective. DX-2400 combined with bevacizumab resulted in
increased tumor growth delay in vivo. This may be due to the
fact that DX-2400 treatment blocks anti-VEGF antibody–stimulated increases in tumoral gelatinolytic activity. Interestingly, in
gliomas anti-VEGF therapy may increase tumor invasiveness (35).
Combination therapy with antiangiogenic and novel antiproteolytic agents such as DX-2400 represents a promising approach
that may produce a synergistic antitumor effect and a survival
benefit for patients.
Alternate approaches for the treatment of cancer are likely to
be offered by the development of inhibitors selectively targeting
tumor-associated MMPs while sparing other MMPs whose activity
is beneficial to the host. For example, increased expression of
MMP-12 by colon carcinoma cells is associated with increased
survival (36) and MMP-8–deficient male mice display increased
skin cancer susceptibility and delayed wound healing (37). Thus,
the dual function of some MMPs during tumor progression
represents an obstacle for nonselective MMP inhibitors. MMP
intervention strategies (12) have met with limited clinical success
and severe side effects that may be partly due to impairment of

collagen turnover in the musculoskeletal system. MMP-14–
deficient mice exhibit severe fibrosis of soft tissues (4). In
contrast, heterozygous mice are morphologically indistinguishable
from the wild-type littermates (38), suggesting that a partial
inhibition of MMP-14 activity should not induce the side effects
observed in the MMP-14 knockout. DX-2400 treatment of Lewis
rats for 28 days at up to 75 mg/kg every 2nd day did not lead to
any clinical or histologic findings including abnormalities of the
joints (data not shown). These pilot toxicology study results offer
the promise that DX-2400 will be well tolerated in the clinic. The
pursuit of MMP-14 inhibition as a path to block tumor growth,
invasion, and metastases appears attractive in light of the
emerging pivotal role of MMP-14 in cancer. Our findings
pharmacologically validate the role of MMP-14 in oncology and
emphasize the therapeutic potential of specific antibody-based
MMP inhibitors such as DX-2400.
