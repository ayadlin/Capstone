ABSTRACT
Adaptive immune responses require activation and expansion of antigen-specific
T cells. Whereas early T cell activation is independent of exogenous cystine (Cys2),
T cell proliferation is dependent of Cys2. However, the exact roles of Cys2 in T cell
proliferation still need to be determined. The aim of this study was to elucidate
why activated human T cells require exogenous Cys2 in order to proliferate. We
activated purified naïve human CD4+ T cells and found that glutathione (GSH) levels
and DNA synthesis were dependent on Cys2 and increased in parallel with increasing
concentrations of Cys2. Vice-versa, the GSH synthesis inhibitor L-buthioninesulfoximine (BSO) and inhibition of Cys2 uptake with glutamate inhibited GSH and DNA
synthesis in parallel. We further found that thioredoxin (Trx) can partly substitute
for GSH during DNA synthesis. Finally, we show that GSH or Trx is required for the
activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme responsible for generation of
the deoxyribonucleotide DNA building blocks. In conclusion, we show that activated
human T cells require exogenous Cys2 to proliferate and that this is partly explained
by the fact that Cys2 is required for production of GSH, which in turn is required for
optimal RNR-mediated deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and DNA replication.

transportation of Cys2 over the plasma membrane [2, 8, 9],
but shortly after activation xc− becomes strongly upregulated
in both human and mouse T cells and provide the cells with
the required amount of Cys2/Cys needed for proliferation
[1, 8, 10]. However, the exact mechanisms that are dependent
on Cys in order for T cells to proliferate still need to be
identified.
Cell proliferation requires doubling of the cell
constituents including replication of the DNA. Availability
of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) DNA
building blocks is the limiting factor in DNA synthesis. In
resting cells, the dNTP pools are kept low, but during DNA
synthesis in the S phase the dNTP pool increases several fold
[11–14]. Insufficient levels of dNTP results in an elongation
of the S phase [15]. Furthermore, it is essential that the dNTP
levels are neither too high nor unbalanced as dysregulated
dNTP levels lead to an increased rate of mutagenesis [16].
Thus, DNA synthesis requires a strictly regulated continuous
de novo synthesis of dNTPs. Ribonucleotide reductase

INTRODUCTION
A key point in specific immune responses is the
activation and proliferation of antigen-specific T cells. We
and others have shown that exogenous cystine (Cys2), the
oxidized dimeric form of cysteine (Cys), is dispensable for
early T cell activation but indispensable for T cell proliferation
[1, 2]. Due to the oxidizing environment, approximately 90%
of Cys is found as Cys2 in the extracellular space. Plasma
thus contains 50–100 μM Cys2, whereas the concentration
of Cys is very low compared to other amino acids [3, 4].
Cys is transported over the cell membrane predominantly by
the neutral amino acid transporters ASCT1 (SLC1A4) and
ASCT2 (SLC1A5), whereas Cys2 exclusively is transported
by the xc− cystine/glutamate antiporter composed of the
heavy subunit 4F2 hc (CD98) and the light subunit xCT
(SLC7A11) [5, 6]. Inside the cell, Cys2 is rapidly reduced
to Cys due to the reducing intracellular milieu [7]. Naïve T
cells express no or very low levels of xc− and are deficient in

(RNR) is a key enzyme for dNTP generation. RNR generates
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDP) through reduction
of the corresponding ribonucleoside diphospate (NDP)
[11–14]. After conversion from NDP, dNDP is finally
phosphorylated to dNTP. RNR is responsible for maintaining
the total dNTP pool size and ensuring that the levels of the four
dNTPs are balanced. During the catalysis, the 2′-OH group of
the NDP ribose ring is reduced to hydrogen. In this process,
a disulfide bridge is generated in the active site of RNR
[11–14]. In order for RNR to restore its original configuration
and be capable of catalyzing a new round of NDP reduction,
external thiol-dependent systems are required to reduce the
disulfide bridge in the active site. Thioredoxin (Trx) and later
glutaredoxin (Grx) were discovered as thiol electron donors
for RNR in E. coli [17, 18]. Unlike Trx, Grx was found to
be functional as an electron donor only in the presence of
glutathione (GSH). In E. coli, the glutaredoxin-glutathione
(Grx/GSH) system is the most efficient electron donor for
RNR [12, 19], but in yeast the major electron donor is Trx
[20]. Which system that is functional in mammalian cells is
less clear, although cell-free studies using recombinant mouse
RNR have indicated that both Trx and the Grx/GSH system
can reduce RNR [21].
GSH is synthesized in the cytosol and consists of
the amino acids glutamate, Cys and glycine, where Cys
is believed to be the limiting amino acid [22, 23]. Several
studies have shown that GSH plays essential roles in T cell
function and proliferation [2, 24–29]. These studies indicate
that GSH is not required during the early steps of T cell
activation, but that it is essential for processes close to or at
the level of DNA synthesis. However, the exact role(s) of
GSH during T cell proliferation still needs to be determined.
Taking into account that Cys is required for GSH synthesis
[22, 23], it could be speculated that in order to proliferate,
human T cells need exogenous Cys2 to generate sufficient
amounts of GSH that subsequently supply the reducing
power required for RNR activity and thereby dNTP
synthesis and DNA replication. The aim of this study was
to identify processes in which exogenous Cys2 is required
in order for T cell proliferation to take place.

dNTP and DNA synthesis [12], we first wanted to study
whether a correlation exists between the requirement for
Cys and GSH and DNA synthesis in T cells. To study
a homogenous T cell population, we purified naïve
CD4+ T cells from buffy coats obtained from healthy
blood donors. The resulting cell population consisted of
approximately 98% CD4+CD45RA+CD25−CD69− T cells
[1]. We stimulated the purified T cells with anti-CD3
and anti-CD28-coated Dynabeads for 3 days in Cys2free DMEM tissue culture medium supplemented with
increasing concentrations of Cys2. We found that both
GSH levels and DNA synthesis were strictly dependent on
Cys2 (Figure 1A). The levels of GSH and DNA synthesis
increased in parallel with increasing concentrations of
Cys2 in the medium. To determine whether the dependency
of Cys2 for DNA synthesis was due to the requirement
of Cys2 for GSH synthesis or for other GSH-independent
mechanisms, we next stimulated the cells for 3 days in
X-VIVO 15 tissue culture medium that contains 290 μM
Cys2 with various concentrations of BSO that specifically
inhibits synthesis of GSH. BSO concentrations of 100 μM
and above completely depleted GSH in the T cells.
Likewise, DNA synthesis was impaired by BSO, although
we noticed a small displacement between the two curves
(Figure 1B). These results suggested that DNA synthesis
is dependent on Cys2 due to the requirement of Cys2 for
GSH synthesis and not for other mechanisms. To further
investigate the requirement of exogenous Cys2 for GSH
and DNA synthesis, we inhibited the uptake of Cys2 by
incubation of the cells with increasing concentrations
of glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is the main exchange
substrate in the xc− cystine/glutamate antiporter-mediated
uptake of Cys2 and is a highly specific inhibitor of Cys2
uptake [6]. We found that glutamic acid inhibited GSH
and DNA synthesis in parallel (Figure 1C). As for BSOtreated cells, we noticed a small displacement between
the curves for GSH and DNA synthesis suggesting that
some residual DNA synthesis can take place in the absence
of GSH. From these experiments we could conclude that
T cells require exogenous Cys2 to produce GSH, and that
they need GSH for normal DNA synthesis to take place.
To further study GSH occurrence and production,
we isolated naïve CD4+ T cells and left them either
unstimulated or stimulated them with anti-CD3/CD28
beads in X-VIVO 15 tissue culture medium with or
without 100 μM BSO for 0 to 72 hours. We found that
freshly purified naïve CD4+ T cells contain GSH, and
that the GSH level slowly declines in unstimulated
T cells independently of the presence of BSO (Figure 1D).
This indicated that naïve unstimulated T cells consume
or lose GSH to the tissue culture medium and that they
do not actively produce GSH in vitro. Stimulation of the
T cells in the presence of BSO lead to a rapid decline
in GSH indicating that T cell stimulation accelerates
the consumption or loss of GSH. T cell stimulation in
the absence of BSO initially led to a decline in GSH

RESULTS
Exogenous cystine is required for GSH and DNA
synthesis
We have recently shown that activation of human
T cells as assessed by the upregulation of the activation
markers CD25 and CD69 as well as IL-2 production
is independent of exogenous Cys2. In contrast, DNA
synthesis as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation
is strictly dependent on the presence of Cys2 in the
tissue culture medium [1]. As Cys is supposed to be the
limiting amino acid in the synthesis of GSH [22, 23] and
it has been suggested that GSH can provide the reducing
power necessary for RNR to produce dNDP required for

synthesis [12, 21], and we wanted to see whether this could
also be the case in human T cells. We therefore determined
the expression of Trx in human CD4+ T cells stimulated
for 0 to 72 h and compared it with Trx expression in the
human leukemic T cell line Jurkat. We found that naïve
CD4+ T cells express very low levels of Trx and that T cell
stimulation induces significant Trx upregulation. Following
72 h of stimulation, primary T cells expressed Trx levels
similar to those of Jurkat cells (Figure 2A).
If Trx can substitute for GSH, it would be expected
that DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells with a constitutive high
level of Trx would be more resistant to GSH depletion than
primary T cells. We consequently treated primary T cells
and Jurkat cells in parallel with increasing concentrations
of BSO for 48 h and subsequently measured GSH levels
and DNA synthesis. We found that even though GSH levels
decreased at equal rates in the two cell types in response
BSO treatment, DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells was much

Thioredoxin and GSH can partly substitute for
each other in DNA synthesis
From the experiments shown in Figure 1A–1C we
could conclude that exogenous Cys2 is required for GSH
production and that GSH is required for optimal DNA
synthesis in activated CD4+ T cells. However, we also
noted that some residual DNA synthesis took place even
in cells completely depleted of GSH (Figure 1B and 1C).
This indicated that GSH can be replaced by other reducing
agents during DNA synthesis. It has been suggested that
Trx and the Grx/GSH system can substitute for each
other in providing the reducing power required for DNA

more resistant to BSO treatment than DNA synthesis in
primary T cells (Figure 2B). This supported that Trx can
substitute for GSH in DNA synthesis in human T cells.
Trx-mediated reduction of other proteins results in
oxidation of Trx [30, 31]. In order for Trx to be capable of
catalyzing a new round of reduction, Trx must it-self be
reduced. The Trx reductases (TrxR) are the only enzymes
known to reduce oxidized Trx, and inhibition of TrxR
impairs the redox function of Trx [30–32]. Auranofin (Au)
is an irreversible inhibitor of TxrR [33]. To determine the
concentration of Au required to inhibit TrxR in primary
T cells, we stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells with CD3/
CD28 beads for 3 days in the presence of increasing
concentrations of Au and subsequently measured the TxrR
activity. We found that Au already at 25 nM significantly
inhibited TrxR activity (Figure 2C).

To further investigate whether GSH and Trx
can substitute for each other during DNA synthesis in
primary T cells, we next stimulated CD4+ T cells in a
checkerboard titration of BSO and Au for 3 days. We
subsequently measured GSH levels, DNA synthesis
as 3H-thymidine and BrdU incorporation, and T cell
division as dilution of CFSE. We found that the low
dose of Au (25 nM) did not significantly affect DNA
synthesis or cell division in the absence of BSO (Figure
3A–3D). Treatment with the low dose of BSO (100 μM)
without Au completely abrogated GSH expression and
reduced 3H-thymidine and BrdU incorporation and cell
division, although it did not affect the percentage but
only the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells that
incorporated BrdU (Figure  3A–3D). Interestingly, the
combination of the low dose of Au (25 nM) and BSO

blot analysis. R1 is only expressed in very low amounts
in naïve CD4+ T cells. However, upon stimulation R1
is upregulated and within 48 hours the expression level
in primary T cells is comparable to that seen in Jurkat T
cells (Figure 4A). In the conversion of NDP to dNDP,
RNR is oxidized and its further function is dependent on
reduction by external electron donors such as Grx/GSH
or Trx [21]. If RNR is not reduced, dNDP and thereby
dNTP production halts. Therefore dNTP levels can be used
as an output for RNR activity [34]. To obtain a sufficient
number of cells, we used Jurkat T cells for these analyses.
Since dNTP levels fluctuate during the different stages
of the cell cycle, we initially synchronized the cells by
serum starvation. Upon release from serum starvation,
we either left the synchronized cells untreated or treated
them with BSO or Au alone or with a combination of both
that resulted in a 50% reduction of cells in the S phase as
detemined by BrdU staining (Figure 4B). After 16 hours

(100 μM) completely abolished 3H-thymidine and BrdU
incorporation and cell division (Figure 3B–3D). These
experiments demonstrated that inhibition of either
GSH or Trx still allows some DNA synthesis, whereas
simultaneous inhibition of GSH and Trx completely
abolishes DNA synthesis. This further supported that
GSH and Trx can partly substitute for each other during
DNA synthesis.

GSH and/or Trx is required for dNTP
production
A key molecule in DNA synthesis is RNR that
converts NDP into dNDP. First, we determined the
expression of the regulatory subunit of RNR (R1) in
human primary T cells compared to Jurkat T cells. We
stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells for 72 hours with anti-CD3/
CD28 beads and determined R1 expression by Western

extracted dNTP and measured the dCTP concentrations
as a representative for dNTP. Treatment with either BSO
or Au alone did not significantly affect the amount of
dCTP synthesized. However, the combination of BSO and
Au significantly reduced the amount of dCTP produced
(Figure 4C). This indicated that the RNR activity is
significantly impaired in T cells when both GSH and

Trx are inhibited. Alternatively, inhibition of GSH and
Trx might affect the RNR levels in the cells. To rule
out this possibility, we determined R1 expression in
T cells activated in the presence of different combinations
of BSO and Au concentrations. The combination of
low concentrations of BSO and Au, which completely
abolished DNA synthesis (Figure 3B and 3D), did not

completely independently of exogenous Cys2. Whether
a correlation between the levels of exogenous Cys2 and
intracellular GSH exists in activated T cells has to our
knowledge not been published previously. Here we
show that a direct correlation exists between the levels
of exogenous Cys2 and intracellular GSH in activated
human T cells, and that this correlation also encompasses
DNA synthesis. Furthermore, T cells activated in tissue
culture medium containing Cys2 concentrations below
3 μM were completely depleted of GSH. Thus, although
the transsulfuration pathway has been described in T cells,
this pathway clearly cannot supply T cells with sufficient
amounts of Cys for GSH production as recently described
for hepatocytes [44]. That transsulfuration cannot supply
human T cells for the amount of Cys required for GSH and
DNA synthesis was further supported by the observation
that blocking Cys2 uptake completely inhibited GSH
production and DNA synthesis although the cells were
cultured in medium containing methionine. In accordance
with previous studies [26–28], we found that BSO
inhibited GSH production and DNA synthesis in parallel.
Thus, when GSH synthesis was blocked, DNA synthesis
was halted although Cys2/Cys was freely available for the
T cells. From these results it could be concluded that in
order to proliferate, activated T cells need exogenous Cys2
to produce GSH that subsequently is required for optimal
DNA synthesis. This is in good agreement with previous
studies which found that proliferation and survival of
human natural killer cells and primary and malignant
B cells are dependent on exogenous Cys2/Cys [45–48].
DNA synthesis is, among other factors, dependent
on a balanced presence of dNTP generated from RNRproduced dNDP [49, 50]. RNR activity requires an
electron donor, which in bacteria, yeast and plants is
usually either Trx or Grx [12]. From test tubes experiments
using recombinant mouse RNR, it has been shown that
both Trx and Grx can reduce mammalian RNR, and that
the Grx function is dependent on GSH [21]. We found
that GSH was required for optimal DNA synthesis and
T cell proliferation; however, we noted some residual
DNA synthesis and proliferation in T cells completely
depleted of GSH, indicating that other electron donors
might be able to substitute for the Grx/GSH pathway. We
found a high constitutive expression of Trx in the human
leukemic T cell line Jurkat. Combined with the observation
that DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells is much more resistant
to BSO treatment than DNA synthesis in primary T cells,
although the GSH production is equally sensitive to BSO,
this supported that Trx can substitute for GSH as electron
donor for RNR in human T cells. The synergistic effect
of BSO and Au on dNTP production and phosphorylation
of H2AX further supported that both GSH and Trx play a
role in DNA synthesis. Thus, our study extended previous
experiments using recombinant mouse RNR and indicated
that Grx/GSH is the primary electron donor for RNR
in intact T cells, but that Trx also plays a role and can

together, these experiments indicated that the inability of
T cells to synthesize DNA when GSH and Trx are
inhibited is not caused by a reduced level of RNR but
rather by impaired activity of RNR.
If RNR activity and thereby dNTP production
are impaired in cells with reduced GSH and Trx, DNA
double-stranded breaks (DSB) due to DNA replication
stress would be expected in these cells [35, 36]. H2AX,
a member of the histone family, is rapidly phosphorylated
at serine 139 in response to DSB, and this serine
139-phosphorylated form of H2AX is denoted γH2AX
[37, 38]. In order to study whether the cells showed signs
of DSB in response to inhibition of GSH and Trx, we
stimulated purified CD4+ T cells in a checkerboard titration
of BSO and Au for 48 h. The cells were subsequently lyzed
and their levels of γH2AX determined. Whereas γH2AX
was not increased in cells treated with either BSO or Au
alone compared to untreated cells, the γH2AX levels were
clearly increased in cells treated with the combination of
BSO and Au (Figure 4D, middle row). These observations
indicated that DNA replication is impaired in cells with
reduced GSH and Trx activity and supported that GSH
and/or Trx is required for RNR activity and thereby dNTP
production.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that exogenous Cys2 is
indispensable for proliferation of activated human
T cells because it is required for production of GSH that
subsequently is required for optimal RNR activity and
thereby dNDP and dNTP production. For several years,
the general paradigm was that T cells cannot import Cys2.
This paradigm built on early measurements of Cys and
Cys2 uptake, which indicated that lymphocytes express the
ASCT1 and/or ASCT2 transporters for Cys but not the xc−
transporter for Cys2 [7, 9, 39]. Based on these observations
it was suggested that a sufficient high concentration of
exogenous Cys in the microenvironment is provided to
T cells by activated antigen presenting cells [40, 41]. Later
it was found that although naïve T cells do not express xc−,
T cell activation strongly induces the expression of xc−,
and it was demonstrated that xc− can provide activated
T cells with the required amount of Cys2 needed for T cell
proliferation [1, 8, 10]. One remaining question was why
T cell proliferation is dependent on exogenous Cys2. Cys
together with glutamate and glycine constitute the building
blocks of GSH, and it has therefore been suggested that
T cells require exogenous Cys2/Cys to generate GSH
[42, 43]. As GSH is required for optimal T cell proliferation
[2, 26–29], a dependency of exogenous Cys2 for GSH
synthesis would explain the central role of exogenous
Cys2 in T cell proliferation. However, it has been proposed
that T cells can provide Cys for GSH synthesis by an
alternative route via the transsulfuration pathway [8]
in which methionine is converted to Cys inside the cell

substitute for Grx/GSH in this process. That either Grx/
GSH or Trx can act as electron donor for RNR in intact
mammalian cells is supported by the observation that
hepatocyte proliferation in vivo requires either GSH or at
least one functional allele of the TrxR 1 gene [51].
The significance of plasma Cys2 and intracellular
GSH levels for CD4+ T cells in connection with diseases
has primarily been studied in relation to HIV. Several
studies have shown that HIV infected persons tend to have
lower plasma Cys2 and intracellular GSH levels compared
to healthy controls [52]. In light of this, supplementation
with the drug N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), which increases
plasma Cys levels, has been studied in HIV infected
persons. Such trials showed that oral supplementation
with NAC replenished GSH in lymphocytes and improved
the overall T cell function [53]. The importance of Cys2
and GSH in relation to HIV infection is underscored
by the fact that the decrease in CD4+ T cell numbers in
the late asymptomatic stage of HIV seemed to coincide
with a decrease in plasma Cys2 [4], and likewise the
concentrations of glutathione reductase was found to
be lower in patients with symptomatic HIV than in
asymptomatic HIV patients [54]. Whether HIV causes
lowered glutathione reductase and GSH levels in CD4+
T cells or the lowered levels allow for HIV replication
is not known. An increased knowledge of the roles
of antioxidants in CD4+ T cell biology could help to
understand the connection between decreased antioxidant
levels and exacerbation of HIV. Interestingly, studies
have shown that both BSO and Au could potentially be
used in treatment of HIV. BSO in combination with an
HDAC inhibitor was shown to be useful in killing latently
infected CD4+ T cells, as BSO made the infected cells
more susceptible to treatment with the HDAC inhibitor.
This allowed the use of both drugs at concentrations that
were non-toxic for uninfected cells [55]. Au was shown to
be more effective in inducing apoptosis in memory CD4+
T cells than in naïve CD4+ T cells [56]. As memory CD4+
T cells are a major reservoir for HIV, Au, like BSO, might
be effective in killing latently infected cells when used in
combination with other drugs.
In conclusion, in this study we show that exogenous
Cys2 is required for proliferation of activated human
T cells, because Cys2 is required for GSH production and
GSH is essential for optimal RNR activity and thereby for
dNTP synthesis and DNA replication.

Buffy coats were obtained from anonymous healthy
blood donors. Written informed consent was obtained from
blood donors at the Department of Clinical Immunology,
University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen and
used without the possibility to identify case specific
information. Use of these buffy coats for research was
approved by the ethical committee, Region H, The
Capital Region of Denmark. Mononuclear cells were
isolated from the buffy coats by Lymphoprep™ (AxisShield, Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation.
Naïve CD4+ T cells were subsequently isolated from
the mononuclear cell preparation by negative selection
using the naïve CD4+ T cell isolation kit II (130-094-131,
Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany)
and MACS® Separation Columns (130-042-401,

instructions. The purified T cells were cultured in either
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 21013,
Invitrogen, Paisly, UK) or X-VIVO 15 medium (1041,
Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). DMEM 21013 contains no
Cys2, methionine, glutamine, glutamic acid or GSH.
It was supplemented to a final concentration of 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 0.5 IU/l penicillin,
500 mg/l streptomycin, 50 μM methionine and various
concentrations of Cys2. X-VIVO 15 medium contains
290 μM Cys2, 200 μM methionine, 4 mM glutamine and
no GSH and with L-glutamic acid concentrations only
known by the company. The cells were stimulated with
Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (111.31D,

0.5 × 106 cells/ml at a bead to cell ratio of two to five.

Jurkat cells
Jurkat cells (E6) were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (R5886, Sigma-Aldrich). RPMI 1640 contains
208 μM Cys2, 100 μM methionine, 118 μM glutamic
acid, 3.25 μM GSH and was supplemented to a final
concentration of 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 0.5 IU/l

performed using the Promega GSH-Glo™ Glutathione
Assay (V6911, Promega Biotech AB, Nacka, Sweden).
This is a luminescence-based assay in which a luciferin
derivative is converted into luciferin in the presence
of GSH in a reaction that is catalyzed by glutathione
S-transferase. The amount of light generated in the firefly
luciferase-coupled reaction is proportional to the amount
of GSH present in the sample. The assay was performed

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We measured
only GSH (also called reduced glutathione) and did not
include measurements of the oxidized form of glutathione
(GSSG). In brief, at the indicated times, the cells were
resuspended in 50 μl PBS and transferred to NuncImmuno™ MicroWell™ 96 well polystyrene plates. 50 μl
GSH-Glo™ Reagent 2X was added to each well, and the
plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature under
gentle shaking. 100 μl Luciferin Detection Reagent was
added and the luminescence was subsequently measured
on a Wallac 1420 Victor2TM Workstation from PerkinElmer.
Measurements of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)
activity were performed using the Abcam® Thioredoxin
Reductase (TrxR) Assay Kit (ab83463, Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom). This is a colorimetric assay
in which reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic) acid
(DTNB) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) by TrxR
generates a yellow color (λmax 412 nm). The assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, cells were lyzed in 100 ul assay buffer + Protease/
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (5872S, Cell Signaling)
and 12.5 µl lysate was used for each reaction. As other
enzymes, such as glutathione reductase and glutathione
peroxidase, can also reduce DTNB, two measurements
were performed for each sample; the first measures total
DTNB reduction in the sample, and the second measures
DTNB reduction in the presence of a TrxR specific
inhibitor. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm several
times for up to 45 minutes following setup of the assay.
A TNB standard curve and a TrxR positive control were
included for each assay. Enzyme activity in each sample
was calculated from the standard curve.

DNA synthesis was measured by 3H-thymidine
and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation.
The 3H-thymidine incorporation assay was carried out as
previously described [59]. Briefly, cells were incubated
for 48 or 72 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2, and 20 μl medium
(X-VIVO, D-MEM or RPMI-1640) containing 50 μCi/ml
[Methyl-3H]-thymidine (NET027005MC, Perkin Elmer)
was subsequently added to each well resulting in a specific
activity of 1 μCi/well. The incubation was continued
for another 6 hours before the cells were harvested and
3
H-thymidine incorporation was quantified as counts
per minute (cpm) using a scintillation counter. BrdU
incorporation assays were performed using the FITC BrdU
Flow Kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) according
to supplier’s protocol and as previously described [60]. In
short, cultured cells were incubated with 17.7 μM BrdU for
1 hour and subsequently fixed, permeabilized and treated
with DNase. Afterwards the cells were stained with FITC
anti-BrdU and 7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry on
a FACS Calibur.

Cell division assay
CFSE (C34554, Life Technologies, Naerum,
Denmark) was used to stain cells and measure cell division
as previously described [61, 62]. In short, purified naïve
CD4+ T cells were resuspended in 4 ml 37°C PBS. CFSE
was added to the cells at a final concentration of 2.5 μM
CFSE. The cells were then incubated for 9 minutes at
37°C. FBS was added to terminate the incorporation of
CFSE. Following CFSE loading, the cells were incubated
in X-VIVO medium at 37°C in 5% CO2 with anti-CD3/
CD28 beads and the indicated inhibitors. After 72 hours,
the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS
Calibur.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out as previously
described [57, 58]. In short, cells were stimulated with
Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 for the
time indicated at 37°C, lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis
buffer + Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (5872S,
Cell Signaling) and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels.
The proteins were transferred to Amersham Hybond
ECL nitrocellulose sheets (RPN2020D, GE Healthcare,
Brondby, Denmark) and visualized using ECL technology
(RPN2232, GE Healthcare). As primary antibodies
we used rabbit polyclonal anti-H2AX phospho S139
(1:10000) (ab11174, Abcam, Cambirdge, UK), rabbit
polyclonal anti-GAPDH (1:5000) (ab9485, Abcam), rabbit
monoclonal anti-Trx (1:1000) (2429, Cell Signaling, (via
BioNordika Denmark A/S, Herlev, Denmark)), rabbit
polyclonal anti-R1 (1:1000) (3388, Cell Signaling),
and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:1000) (3700S,
Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies included HRPconjugated polyclonal swine anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000)
(P0399, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and HRP-conjugated
polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Ig (1:2000) (P0260, DAKO).

dNTP extraction and quantification
dNTP extraction and quantification was performed
as previously described [63]. For dNTP extraction,
cells were washed in Hanks Balanced Salt solution and
resuspended in 60% ice-cold methanol before being
lysed using ultrasound. The cell debris was pelleted by
centrifugation at 16.000 g for 15 min, 4°C. Supernatants
were transferred to Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters
(UFC500324, Merck Milipore, Hellerup, Denmark)
and centrifuged at 14.000 g for 30 min, 4°C to remove
macromolecules larger than 3 kDa. Liquid was removed
from the sample by freeze drying, and the resultant pellet
was resuspended in 12 μl nuclease-free H2O. The samples
were either used directly for the assay or stored at –80°C.
For dNTP quantification, 5 μl of each sample was mixed
with 20 μl mastermix (1 μl nucleotide detection primer
(10 μM), 1 μl dCTP detection template (10 μM), 1 μl
of FAM-dCTP probe (10 μM), 2 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM),

1 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mM), 2.5 μl of 10X PCR Buffer II,
0.175 μl of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (5U/μl) (4311816,
Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies), and 11.325
μl of nuclease-free H2O). The qPCR program included
a 10 minute hot start at 95°C followed by 75 minutes at
60°C, while measuring the fluorescence intensity every
1 minute. The raw fluorescence spectra for each well
were exported to excel and analyzed. A dCTP standard
curve was included for each assay using dCTP from Life
Technologies (10297–018). The following primers were
used: Nucleotide detection primer 5′-CCG CCT CCA
CCG CC -3′, dCTP detection template 5′-CCA CTC ACT
CTT ACC TCA ATC CTT TGT TTG GCG GTG GAG
GCG G-3′, and FAM-dCTP probe 5′-/6FAM/AGG ATT
