BACKGROUND: Knowledge regarding the incidence, clinical course, and impact of respiratory viral infections in children with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is limited. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated
on the Total Therapy XVI protocol at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital between 2007 and 2011 was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 223
children, 95 (43%) developed 133 episodes of viral acute respiratory illness (ARI) (incidence, 1.1 per 1000 patient-days). ARI without
viral etiology was identified in 65 patients (29%) and no ARI was detected in 63 patients (28%). There were no significant associations noted between race, sex, age, or ALL risk group and the development of ARI. Children receiving induction chemotherapy were
found to be at the highest risk of viral ARI (incidence, 2.3 per 1000 patient-days). Influenza virus was the most common virus (38%)
followed by respiratory syncytial virus (33%). Of 133 episodes of viral ARI, 61% of patients were hospitalized, 26% experienced a complicated course, 80% had their chemotherapy delayed, and 0.7% of patients died. Twenty-four patients (18%) developed viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), 5 of whom (21%) had complications. Patients with viral LRTI had a significantly lower nadir absolute
lymphocyte count; were sicker at the time of presentation; and were more likely to have respiratory syncytial virus, to be hospitalized,
and to have their chemotherapy delayed for longer compared with those with viral upper respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS:
Despite the low incidence of viral ARI in children with ALL, the associated morbidity, mortality, and delay in chemotherapy remain
clinically significant. Viral LRTI was especially associated with high morbidity requiring intensive care-level support. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decades, major advances have been made in therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
resulting in a 10-year survival rate of 92%.1 However, infectious complications remain a significant cause of morbidity
and mortality in children with ALL.2 Of particular importance are respiratory viral infections, which are characterized by
a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild cold symptoms to progression to lower respiratory tract infections
(LRTI), and increased hospitalization rates.3-5 In a prospective multicenter study, 44% of febrile episodes in children with
leukemia were attributed to respiratory viral infections.3 However, to our knowledge, the majority of the existing knowledge regarding the clinical course of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients has been derived from
studies that collectively evaluated adult patients with cancer or transplant recipients. Studies describing the epidemiology
of respiratory viral infections in children with ALL are limited.2,3 In addition, to the best of our knowledge, the incidence
of respiratory infections of any etiology has not been documented in children with ALL to date.
In the current study, a retrospective cohort of children with newly diagnosed ALL treated in a single contemporary
protocol was evaluated for the epidemiology, incidence, clinical course, and impact of respiratory viral infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

All patients (aged 18 years) were enrolled on an ALL treatment protocol (Total Therapy XVI) at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital (SJCRH) in Memphis, Tennessee between October 2007 and May 2011. The ALL treatment regimen
and risk classification of Total Therapy XVI6 were completed using consistent criteria based on the previously published

Total Therapy XV protocol.7 Therapy consisted of a
6-week remission induction, 8-week consolidation, and
120-week continuation phase that included two 3-week
periods of more intensive chemotherapy (reinduction I
and reinduction II). The electronic database for the Total
Therapy XVI cohort and medical records were reviewed
for demographic data, clinical course and outcome, and
results of respiratory viral testing that was driven by the
clinical care of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Respiratory specimens included nasopharyngeal swab
or wash, tracheal aspirate, and/or bronchoalveolar lavage.
Respiratory viral testing consisted of viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody immunoassay, and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) that detected influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The method for
diagnostic testing did not change during the study period.

monocyte count 200 cells/mm3. Clinical complications
included secondary infections, altered mental status, arrhythmia or electrocardiographic changes, bleeding requiring transfusion, congestive heart failure, disseminated
intravascular coagulation, hypotension, intensive care unit
(ICU) admission, respiratory failure, renal failure, and
other complications judged to be clinically significant by
the investigator. Because alanine aminotransferase and
aspartate aminotransferase elevations are common in
patients with ALL receiving chemotherapy, for the purpose
of the current study, aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase elevations at greater than twice the
upper limit of normal that were not temporally related to
chemotherapy were considered a complication of viral
infection. Patient-days were defined as the number of days
contributed by the cohort from the date of ALL diagnosis
to any of the following dates, whichever occurred first:
completion of continuation therapy, death, disease recurrence and removal from the Total Therapy XVI protocol,
or end date of the current study.
Statistical Analysis

Definitions

Patients were classified into 1 of 3 ALL risk groups (low,
standard, or high) based on presenting age, leukocyte
count, central nervous system or testicular leukemia,
immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular genetics,
DNA index, and response to therapy.7 Acute respiratory
illness (ARI) was classified as either upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI) or LRTI. Patients were classified as having an URTI if they had a new onset of any of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat,
or cough, with or without fever, with normal chest physical and radiological examination. Patients with signs or
symptoms of URTI and new abnormal pulmonary findings on chest physical examination or imaging were classified as having LRTIs. Secondary pneumonia suspected or
proven to be of bacterial or fungal etiology was defined
based on clinical and radiological criteria with or without
bacterial or fungal organisms identified in respiratory
specimens. Clinical criteria included new onset or worsening of cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia, with
radiological findings consistent with bacterial or fungal
pneumonia such as consolidation, cavitation, or pneumatocele. Fever was defined as a single oral temperature of
38.38C or an oral temperature of 38.08C that
persisted for >1 hour. Neutropenia was defined as an
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 500 cells/mm3,
lymphopenia as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)
300 cells/mm3, and monocytopenia as an absolute

Groups were compared using the Fisher exact or chisquare tests for categorical data or the Wilcoxon rank sum
test or Student t test for continuous data. All tests were
2-tailed and a P value <.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Incidence density of ARI was reported as
per 1000 patient-days. SAS statistical software (version
9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used.
RESULTS
Incidence of ARI With and Without
Documented Viral Etiology

A cohort of 223 patients with newly diagnosed ALL were
enrolled on Total Therapy XVI and contributed a total of
125,773 patient-days. A total of 133 episodes of ARI with
viral etiology occurred in 95 patients (43%) (Table 1). Of
those, 64 patients had 1 episode, 24 patients had 2 episodes, and 7 patients had 3 episodes of ARI with viral etiology. The incidence density of ARI with viral etiology
was 1.1 per 1000 patient-days (Table 2). A total of 65
patients (29%) had 136 episodes of ARI without viral etiology, resulting in an incidence of 1.1 per 1000 patientdays (Table 1). Sixty-three patients (28%) did not experience any ARI during the study period (Table 1).
Risk Factors for ARI With and Without
Documented Viral Etiology

Children with newly diagnosed ALL were mostly white
males and had standard-risk ALL. There were no significant

differences noted between children who developed ARI
with and without viral etiology and those who did not
develop any ARI during the study period (Table 1).
Patients who developed ARI with viral etiology tended
to be younger (aged <5 years; 55%) compared with
those with ARI without viral etiology (40%) or those
who did not have any ARI (40%; P 5 .19). Although the
majority (62%) of the 133 episodes of ARI with viral etiology occurred during continuation, which is the longest
chemotherapy phase, patients receiving remission induction chemotherapy were at the highest risk of developing
viral respiratory infections, with an incidence of 2.3 per
1000 patient-days (Table 2).

Epidemiology of ARI With Documented Viral
Etiology

Episodes of ARI with viral etiology were proportionately
distributed among the years from 2007 to 2011 (Fig. 1).
The highest number of influenza virus cases, detected in
20 episodes of ARI with viral etiology, was recorded in
2009, whereas there were 15 and 14 episodes, respectively,
detected in 2010 and 2011.
A total of 139 respiratory viruses were identified in
133 episodes of ARI with viral etiology. Coinfection
with 2 viruses occurred in 6 episodes. Of the 133 viral
ARI, 84 (63%) occurred between December and March
(Fig. 2). Influenza virus was the most frequent virus,

Figure 1. Distribution of acute respiratory illness (ARI) with
viral etiology by year. Because before October 2007 children
received therapy as per the previous regimen, only 1 case of
ARI with viral etiology was identified in 2007 and 12 cases
were identified in 2008 as part of the current study. To obtain
an accurate estimate of the frequency of respiratory viral
infections each year, an additional 75 episodes of ARI with
viral etiology that occurred in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were continuing therapy as per the previous Total Therapy XV (TOTXV) protocol and thus were not
enrolled in the current study also were included herein.

identified in 51 episodes (38%), followed by RSV in 45
episodes (34%) (Fig. 2). Respiratory viral infections with
influenza and RSV demonstrated seasonal distribution,
with a peak noted in February (Fig. 2), as reported
previously.8
Description of the Clinical Course and
Outcomes of ARI With Documented Viral
Etiology

Of the 133 episodes of ARI with viral etiology, patients
developed LRTI in 24 episodes (18%) (Table 3). Patients
who developed LRTI with viral etiology had a significantly lower nadir ALC during their illness, with a median
ALC of 165 cells/mm3 (range, 0-989 cells/mm3) compared with a median ALC of 368 cells/mm3 (range, 01800 cells/mm3) among those who had URTI with viral
etiology (P 5 .01). In addition, patients with viral LRTI
were more likely to appear clinically ill and to develop a
higher degree of fever for a longer duration compared
with those with URTI (P<.05) (Table 3).
Influenza virus was the only virus detected in 48 episodes of ARI with viral etiology (36%), the majority
(92%) of which were URTI (Table 3). The influenza virus

was significantly more likely to be detected in those with
URTI compared with those with LRTI (40% vs 17%; P
5 .03). Conversely, RSV was more likely to be associated
with LRTI. RSV was the only virus detected in 41 episodes of viral ARI (31%), 34% of which were LRTI (Table 3). RSV was significantly more likely to be detected in
those with LRTI than in those with URTI with viral etiology (58% vs 25%; P 5.003).
Hospitalization

Eighty-one patients with viral ARI required hospitalization (61%), mostly for the management of febrile neutropenia. Children who developed LRTI were significantly
more likely to be hospitalized than those with URTI
(83% vs 56%; P 5.02).
Complications

Thirty-four cases of viral ARI (26%) had a complicated
clinical course. Of 109 patients with URTI, 21 (19%)
developed complications including otitis media (9
patients), sinusitis (2 patients), parotitis (1 patient), pancytopenia (1 patient), and hypoglycemia (1 patient). Pulmonary nodules suggestive of fungal infection were
detected on chest computed tomography scans completed
for the workup of persistent febrile neutropenia in 3
patients with RSV, influenza B virus, and parainfluenza
virus type 3, respectively. Four other patients presented
with hypotension and fever (1 patient with hMPV and

due to poor oral intake, 1 with influenza A virus and
newly diagnosed ALL, and 1 with influenza A virus with
no alternative etiology for hypotension). All these patients
responded to intravenous fluid infusions without vasopressor support or admission to the ICU.
Patients with viral LRTI were more likely to develop
complications than those with URTI (P 5.002) (Table
3). One patient with RSV LRTI developed viral pericarditis and pericardial tamponade requiring pericardial window. However, secondary suspected or proven bacterial or
fungal infection was the most frequent complication,
occurring in 12 patients with viral LRTI (50%). Sinusitis
was diagnosed in 2 patients (1 with RSV and 1 with the
2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus), acute otitis
media in 1 patient with RSV, and presumed bacterial consolidating pneumonia in 11 patients (7 with RSV, 2 with
the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, 1 with parainfluenza virus type 3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, and 1 with RSV and influenza B virus coinfection).
Of the 11 patients with consolidating pneumonia, 4
developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (3 with RSV and 1 with the 2009 pandemic H1N1
influenza A virus) whereas 5 patients required only nasal
oxygen support and 2 patients did not require any support. The complicated clinical course of 5 patients with viral LRTI (3 patients with RSV, 1 patient with the 2009
pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, and 1 patient with
parainfluenza virus type 3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
bacteremia) progressed further to hemodynamic and multiorgan insufficiency requiring vasopressor support, 1 of
whom (an infant with RSV) received extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation and died 2 months after onset of
infection. ICU admission was required for 6 patients with
LRTI with viral etiology. Of the 13 patients with complicated viral LRTI, 8 (62%) were lymphopenic and 9
(69%) were neutropenic. Only 2 of the 9 patients with
complicated LRTI with RSV (22%) had received immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, and only 1 of the 3
patients with complicated LRTI with influenza virus had
received prior influenza vaccination.
Impact on chemotherapy

A total of 127 patients (95%) were scheduled to receive a
chemotherapy course at the time of onset of viral ARI (Table 3). There was no significant difference noted between
the percentages of patients who had their chemotherapy
delayed or the dose modified among those with viral
LRTI compared with those with viral URTI. However,
patients with viral LRTI had their chemotherapy delayed
for a significantly longer period of time (median, 14.5

URTI (median, 8 days [range, 1-26 days]) (P 5.01).
Viral coinfection

Of the 133 episodes of ARI with viral etiology, patients
were identified as being coinfected with 2 viruses in 6 episodes (5%) (Table 3). Two patients with URTI had RSV
and parainfluenza virus type 3 coinfection, and a third had
parainfluenza type 3 and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A. An additional 3 patients with LRTI were identified
as being coinfected with RSV and cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonitis (1 patient), influenza A and hMPV (1
patient), and RSV and influenza B virus (1 patient). Of the
6 viral coinfection episodes of ARI, only the patient identified as having RSV and influenza B virus LRTI progressed
to develop secondary presumed bacterial pneumonia and
required nasal oxygen support. However, this patient recovered after a 5-day course of oseltamivir and azithromycin
and a 10-day course of vancomycin and cefepime.
Mortality

The infection-related mortality rate was 0.7%. The patient
in question was an 11-month-old girl who received highdose cytarabine for reinduction II chemotherapy. She presented with a 3-day history of progressively worsening
cough and nasal congestion and new onset of fever and respiratory distress with profound neutropenia and lymphopenia, for which she was hospitalized. She had received
palivizumab immunoprophylaxis 10 days before the development of her illness and 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine. Initial evaluation revealed bilateral peribronchial
thickening and RSV was detected on a nasopharyngeal
wash specimen by PCR. Aerosolized ribavirin treatment
was initiated in addition to oxygen support and broadspectrum antibiotic therapy. However, due to progressive
respiratory deterioration and increasing fever, a chest x-ray
repeated on day 5 of hospitalization demonstrated left
lower lobe consolidation pneumonia suggestive of secondary bacterial infection. Her treatment regimen included
vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole, palivizumab, and aerosolized ribavirin. On hospital day 28,
her condition progressed to respiratory and hemodynamic
failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor
followed by extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation support. She died 2 months after onset of the RSV infection.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
to evaluate the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of
respiratory viral infections in children with newly

diagnosed ALL who are treated on contemporary protocols. Respiratory viruses were detected in 133 episodes of
ARI that occurred in less than one-half (43%) of this
cohort over a 31-month period. This accounts for an incidence of 1.1 respiratory viral infections per 1000 patientdays of ALL therapy, which is lower than the incidence
reported in previous studies.3,9 In a Finnish prospective
study of 51 children with leukemia, Koskenvuo et al
detected a respiratory viral etiology in 61 of 138 febrile
episodes (44%) and reported an incidence of 0.8 per
person-year (equivalent to 2.2 per 1000 patient-days) at
risk.3 A previous study9 published in 1995 reported an
incidence of 5.2 per 1000 patient-days at risk (95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.0). The decreasing incidence of respiratory viral infections in children with ALL over the
past decades parallels advances in antiviral immune prophylaxis and chemoprophylaxis and increasing rates of
vaccination as a protective approach against influenza.
However, limitations to the interpretation of the findings
of the current study should be noted. The retrospective
design of the current study may limit the detection of the
complete spectrum of clinical symptoms. Patients with
mild upper respiratory symptoms may not present for
medical care and thus are not consistently represented in
these data. Furthermore, the PCR assay used at the study
institution for respiratory virus testing did not detect rhinovirus/enterovirus, which is the most common cause of
URTI in general and in children with leukemia.3 For
these 2 reasons, many of the less serious respiratory viral
infections may have gone undetected. However, we
believe that this did not have a major impact on the purpose of the current study, which was to evaluate the morbidity, mortality, and chemotherapy delays related to
respiratory viral infections in patients with ALL. A multiplex PCR assay that also detects rhinovirus/enterovirus
was implemented for clinical testing at a later date after
the study. We anticipate that the implementation of this
assay will result in both higher rates of respiratory viral
infection as well as higher rates of viral coinfections.10
The majority of the respiratory viral infections
reported in the current study were detected in children
receiving continuation chemotherapy. However, when
adjusting for the duration of each chemotherapy phase,
children receiving remission induction chemotherapy
were found to be at the highest risk of respiratory viral
infection (2.3 per 1000 patient-days). During induction,
patients were not only neutropenic but also severely
immunosuppressed due to prolonged treatment with
glucocorticoids.

We have found that the influenza virus was the most
frequently detected respiratory virus followed by RSV.
Influenza virus was more likely to cause URTI whereas
RSV was more likely to cause LRTI. Of the 6 patients
who developed influenza LRTI, 3 had the 2009 pandemic
H1N1 influenza A virus and 1 had RSV and influenza B
virus coinfection, whereas the remaining 2 patients had
influenza A virus that was not subtyped. The experience
of SJCRH with influenza infections in general and the
severe 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection in particular has been previously published.11,12 Carr et al11
reviewed the clinical course and outcome of 107 episodes
of influenza infections in pediatric oncology patients
between January 2002 and April 2009 (ie, before emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus). In
their study, 12 of 69 children with leukemia or lymphoma
(17%) were reported to develop LRTI,11 a percentage
that was similar to the current study findings of 12% that
also included the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. Our experience with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza
A infection in children with ALL is not different from
other reports in oncology patients.12-17 Although the majority of immunocompromised patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus developed a mild course of
URTI, a few case reports have described severe morbidity
and mortality. In the current study, no deaths were associated with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection in
children with ALL.
Similar to previous studies,18-20 we found that lymphopenia was a risk factor for the development of LRTI
after respiratory viral infection. However, not only the
presence of lymphopenia at the onset of respiratory viral
infection but also, more specifically, the severity of lymphopenia measured as the nadir ALC during illness was
found to be significantly associated with progression to
LRTI. Children with ALL who developed viral LRTI
were more severely lymphopenic than those who had viral
URTI.
It is interesting to note that 61% of children with
ALL and viral ARI were hospitalized and 26% experienced a complicated course. In general, children with viral
URTI who developed a clinical complication most commonly had secondary infections that resolved without any
residual consequences. Conversely, greater than one-half
of children who had viral LRTI experienced a complicated
clinical course that was more severe than that in children
with viral URTI. Secondary bacterial or fungal pulmonary
infection was the most common complication, occurring
in those with RSV (7 patients), the 2009 pandemic
H1N1 influenza A (2 patients), and RSV-influenza B

coinfection (1 patient) and progressing to multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome in 1 patient. The complicated viral LRTI described in the current study was in agreement
with previous studies that evaluated the severity of RSVrelated and influenza-related clinical courses in immunocompromised children with cancer.12,16-18 It is important
to note that despite the seemingly high rate of complications, the mortality rate was 0.7%, which is at the lower
end of the pediatric fever and neutropenia-related mortality range, which has been reported as 0.5% to 6.6%.21,22
In addition to hospitalization and complications,
ARI with viral etiology has markedly impacted the chemotherapy course in children with ALL. The majority of
those patients who were scheduled to receive chemotherapy had it delayed for a median of 8 days (range, 1-99
days) and the delay was >3 months in children with complicated viral LRTI. It would be important to evaluate the
relationship between ALL outcomes at the end of therapy
and infection-related chemotherapy delays once the
follow-up of the entire cohort of patients with ALL being
treated on the Total Therapy XVI protocol is complete.
In conclusion, despite current advances in ALL cure
rates, molecular diagnostic techniques, antiviral therapies,
and active and passive immune prevention approaches, respiratory viral infections remain a significant burden in
children with ALL.
