Abstract
Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces apoptosis and
cell death in many tumor cells, some cancer cells are still
resistant to the TNF-induced death signal. In this report, we
showed that Smad7, an inhibitory Smad of transforming
growth factor-B (TGF-B) signaling, can overcome the TNF
resistance in human breast and gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of Smad7 induces the degradation of poly(ADPribose) polymerase and the activation of caspase cascade.
Although c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling is involved in TNF-induced cell death, the expression of Smad7
does not synergize the activation of JNK. However, the activation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), the cell survival factor,
is markedly decreased in Smad7-stable cells. Furthermore, the
expression of antiapoptotic target genes of NF-KB is significantly reduced in accordance with the level of Smad7. In
addition, Smad7 mediates the inhibitory activity of TGF-B
on TNF-induced NF-KB activation and the synergistic activity
of TGF-B on TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest
that Smad7 sensitizes the tumor cells to TNF-induced
apoptosis through the inhibition of expression of antiapoptotic NF-KB target genes. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9577–83]

Introduction
Response to various environmental stimuli, including cell death
or proliferation signal, results in different outcomes dependent on
cell contexts. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been known as a
major mediator of apoptosis as well as inflammation and
tumorigenesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a
wide spectrum of human diseases (1). After interacting with its
receptors, TNF induces apoptosis through the recruitment of TNF
receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein and Fasassociated death domain. These complexes stimulate the extrinsic
pathway through the cleavage and activation of caspases (1, 2).
In addition to apoptotic signals, TNF also induces cell survival signals by recruiting the intracellular adaptor molecules receptorinteracting protein (RIP), TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1,
and TRAF2 (3). TRAF2 plays a critical role in activation of
downstream proteins mediated by both TNFR1 and TNFR2 and
has been known in TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor-nB

(NF-nB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK; ref. 4).
The NF-nB is a family of stimulus-induced homodimeric or heterodimeric transcription factors that plays important roles in developmental and immune processes (5). In resting cell, NF-nB is
localized in cytoplasm by interacting with inhibitory proteins
(InBs). When cells are stimulated by exogenous stimulus, InBs are
phosphorylated by upstream InB kinase. This triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of InB by proteasome pathway. The free
NF-nB can be translocated into the nucleus and activate the
transcription of target genes. NF-nB pathway also has a role in
tumor initiation, survival, and progression (6–8).
The transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) superfamily consists
of a large number of structurally related polypeptide growth
factors, such as TGF-h, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and
activins, which play critical roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, adhesion, and death (9). TGF-h sends the signals
through the interaction with heteromeric complexes of type II and
type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (ThRII and ThRI) and
their interaction partners, the Smad proteins (10). The binding
of the TGF-h ligand to type II receptor facilitates the initiation
of signaling through the phosphorylation of type I receptor, which
subsequently phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads, such
as Smad2 and Smad3. Activated Smad2 and Smad3 are leading to
binding with the common mediator Smad, Smad4, and these protein complexes are translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
These Smad complexes can act as coactivators or corepressors in
the nucleus through the interaction with another transcription
factors.
Smad7 is an inhibitory Smad, which functions to block TGF-h–
induced Smad activation and to terminate the signaling pathway
as feedback regulation (11). Smad7 localizes in the nucleus by
interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 or Smurf2 in resting
state and the Smad7-Smurf complex exports to the cytoplasm on
TGF-h treatment. In the cytoplasm, Smurf interacts with TGF-h
receptors and then ubiquitinates and degrades the receptors via
proteasomal pathway. In addition, Smad7 can inhibit the TGF-h
signaling through interfering the interactions between the Smad
proteins and the activated receptors.
Although Smad7 was originally identified as an inhibitory Smad
of TGF-h, there are several reports that suggest that inhibitory
Smads may have another cellular functions and can cooperate with
TGF-h to show some activities. Smad7 is involved in TGF-h–
induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by activating p38 via
TGF-h–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and MAPK kinase (MKK) 3 (12).
In another report, overexpression of Smad7 by adenoviral infection
induced DNA fragmentation and significant increases in cell death
ELISA and caspase-3 assay in rat mesangial cells (13). In contrast,
another Smads, Smad2 or Smad3, had not shown any significant
increases in caspase-3 activity. Most importantly, TGF-h–induced

apoptosis was prevented by inhibition of Smad7 expression, by
antisense mRNA in stably transfected cell lines, or on transient
transfection with antisense oligonucleotides. Recently, we have
shown that Smad7 inhibits TNF-induced NF-nB activity by
blocking TAK1-associating proteins, TAB2 and TAB3, from forming
a complex with TRAF2 (14). Therefore, in this report, we examined
whether inhibition of TNF-induced NF-nB activity by Smad7
sensitizes TNF-induced apoptosis. We show that Smad7 sensitizes
the human tumor cells to TNF-induced apoptosis through the
inhibition of the survival signal NF-nB activation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. SNU638 human gastric cancer cells
established from gastric carcinomas of patients and MCF7 human breast
cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Stably Smad7-expressing cells were generated by retroviral
infection of LPCX-Flag-Smad7 as described (15) and maintained with
400 ng/mL puromycin. HeLa cell was grown in DMEM with 10% FBS,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin in a 37jC incubator
with 5% CO2. Caspase-8 p20 (H134), Smad7 (N19 or P20), InBa (FL), and
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 (FL) antibodies were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phosphorylated MAPK and caspase-3
antibodies were from Cell Signaling and Flag (M2) and h-actin (clone
AC-15) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
antibody was purchased from Upstate.
Transient transfection and luciferase assay. Transfection and reporter
assay were done as described previously (15). Briefly, MCF7 cells were
seeded in 12-well plates at 1  105 per well as triplicates and transiently

transfected with NF-nB reporter and Smad7 expression plasmid. A
h-galactosidase DNA was used as an internal control. We used LipofectAMINE Plus as transfection agents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen). After 6 h, medium was changed with serumcontaining medium and treated with TGF-h1 or TNF following 12 h. All
assays were done in triplicate, and data shown represent the mean of three
independent experiments.
Design and transfection of Smad7 small interfering RNA. Specific
small interfering RNA (siRNA) for Smad7 was made from Dharmacon, Inc.
Two human Smad7-specific sequences were used, siRNA1 (5¶-GAAACTGAAGGAGCGGCAG-3¶) and siRNA2 (5¶-ATTCGGACAACAAGAGTCA-3¶),
according to nucleotides 303 to 321 and 905 to 923, respectively (Genbank
accession number AF015261). siGENOME SMARTpool SMAD7 siRNA was
purchased from Dharmacon. MCF7 and HeLa cells were seeded at 60%
density in six-well plate. After 24 h, transfection was done using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).
Western blotting. The cells were treated with TNF (10 ng/mL) or
TGF-h1 (5 ng/mL) for indicated times and cells were lysed in a buffer
containing 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
10% glycerol, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche). For
immunoblotting, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. After incubating with the appropriate primary
antibodies, proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce).
Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot. Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) was used for the isolation of total RNA from MCF7-LPCX
or Smad7 cells, which were treated with TNF for 24 h. For reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we used OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were normalized
with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels

Northern blot analysis, 15 Ag RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose
gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were hybridized
with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for cIAP-1, FLIP, XIAP, and GAPDH. After
overnight incubation, membranes were washed thrice and then visualized
by autoradiography.

Results
Smad7 sensitizes the cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. To
understand the role of Smad7 in TNF-mediated apoptosis, we
examined TNF-induced cell death in Smad7-stable cell lines. The
majority of cancer cells are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis.
MCF7 human breast cancer cells and SUN638 human gastric
cancer cells were also resistant to TNF-induced cytotoxicity as
shown by the cellular morphology (Fig. 1A). However, TNF
markedly induced cell death in MCF7 and SNU638 cells stably
expressing Smad7 (Fig. 1A). No evident cell death was observed
when these cells were cultured in the absence of TNF, suggesting
that Smad7 expression greatly sensitizes MCF7 and SNU638 cells to
TNF-induced cell death. When cell viability was measured using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay,
the viability of control cells was not affected by the addition of
TNF (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, TNF decreased the cell
viability of Smad7-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner to
f50% of control cells.
TNF is capable of inducing either apoptotic or necrotic cell
death in certain types of cells (16). Therefore, we asked whether
Smad7 sensitizes TNF-induced cell death via apoptosis. We first
examined the cleavage of PARP as apoptotic marker. TNF did not
cause PARP cleavage in control MCF7 cells (MCF7-LPCX) or
SNU638 cells (SNU638-LPCX), whereas TNF caused PARP cleavage
in MCF7 cells expressing Smad7 (MCF7-Smad7; Fig. 1B). Caspase
activation is the central machinery in apoptosis, and TNF mediates
apoptotic cell death via the cell receptor pathway initiating from
caspase-8 activation (17). Because MCF7 does not express caspase3 due to a genomic deletion, we examined subsequent activation
of the effector caspase-3 in SNU638 cells. Activation of caspase-3
was observed in SNU638 cells (Fig. 2A). No caspase-8 activation
was found in control SNU638 cells (SNU638-LPCX) treated with
TNF, whereas TNF treatment markedly enhanced caspase-8 cleavage in SNU638-Smad7 cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm the role of a caspase cascade in apoptosis mediated by Smad7 and TNF, we tested
the effect of a specific caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) as well as a
general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) on cell death induced by
TNF treatment in Smad7-expressing MCF7 cells. Both inhibitors
effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with TNF,
concomitant with caspase-8 and caspase-3 inhibitions (Fig. 2B).
Similar results were also found in Smad7-expressing SNU638 cells
treated with TNF (data not shown). These results thus indicate
that the apoptosis induced by Smad7 and TNF is mediated via
caspase-8 activation. To confirm this finding, we examined the
effect of Smad7-specific siRNA in MCF7 cells stably expressing
Smad7. Knockdown of Smad7 expression by transfection with
Smad7 siRNA reduced caspase-8 and PARP cleavage induced by

A nonspecific band (*) was detected by the caspase-8 antibody. B, MCF7 cells
stably expressing Smad7 were treated with TNF in the presence or absence
of 10 Amol/L of z-IETD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk for 24 h. The cell lysates were
immunoblotted with anti-PARP antibody or caspase-8 antibody. C, MCF7 cells
stably expressing Smad7 were transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNAs against
Smad7 or scramble (SCR ) followed by treatment with TNF for 24 h. The lysates

the TNF treatment (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Smad7
enhances the apoptotic activity of TNF in MCF7 and SNU638 cells.
Smad7 does not activate JNK. Previous reports showed that
the JNK pathway plays an important role in TNF-induced apoptosis
(18). To see the involvement of the MAPK pathway in Smad7
sensitization of TNF-induced apoptosis, we used MAPK inhibitors
in MCF7 cells expressing Smad7. PARP cleavage was decreased by
treatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125, but SB203580, an inhibitor
of p38, and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK1), did not show any inhibitory effects (Fig. 3A). This finding also confirmed the involvement
of the JNK pathway in TNF-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells. We
next examined the activation of MAPKs p38, JNK, and ERK by

Figure 3. JNK activity is critical for apoptosis. A, MCF7 cells stably expressing Smad7 were treated with 10 Amol/L of p38 inhibitor (SB203580), JNK inhibitor
(SP600125), or MEK1 inhibitor (U0126) for 1 h followed by 10 ng/mL TNF for 24 h. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-PARP antibody. B, Smad7 does not
enhance JNK activity. MCF7 cells were treated with TNF for 0, 5, or 15 min, and lysates were immunoblotted with phosphorylated p38 (Phospho-p38 ), phosphorylated
JNK (Phospho-JNK), or phosphorylated ERK (Phospho-ERK) antibody. Total amounts of each protein were detected with each antibody and h-actin.

TNF in MCF7 cells stably expressing Smad7. However, the activity of JNK was not enhanced in MCF7-Smad7 cells (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that Smad7 does not induce apoptosis through the
enhancement of JNK activity. TNF-induced activation of p38 was
markedly decreased in MCF7-Smad7 cells; however, the significance
of this decrease is not clear because p38 is not involved
in TNF-induced apoptosis in MCF7-Smad7 cells. To eliminate the
possibility of involvement of reduced activation of p38 in apoptosis by Smad7, we used the p38 wild-type or constitutive active
MKK6 constructs. Transient expression of these constructs induced
the constitutive activation of p38 in MCF7-Smad7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although p38 is highly activated in transfected
MCF7-Smad7 cells, TNF still induced apoptosis compared with
mock-transfected cells, suggesting that a lower level of p38
activation by TNF in MCF7-Smad7 cells does not contribute to
higher apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The basal activity of ERK
was high in control MCF7 cells, but TNF-induced activation was
delayed in MCF7-Smad7 cells.
TGF-B1 inhibits TNF-induced NF-KB activation through the
induction of Smad7. We next examined whether TGF-h1 inhibits
TNF-induced NF-nB activation through the induction of Smad7.
First, we checked whether TGF-h1 blocks TNF-induced InBa
degradation. For this purpose, we used HeLa cells because both
MCF7 and SNU638 cells do not respond to TGF-h1 due to the lack
of TGF-h type II receptor expression (19, 20). As shown in Fig. 4A,
treatment of TNF significantly enhanced InBa degradation, and
TGF-h1 pretreatment for 24 h almost completely blocked TNFinduced InBa degradation in HeLa cells. We observed slow
induction of Smad7 in HeLa cells after TGF-h1 treatment. The
level of Smad7 induced by TGF-h1 correlated with the inhibition of
InBa degradation. Shorter TGF-h1 pretreatment did not block the
degradation of InBa, suggesting that certain levels of Smad7
protein are required to inhibit TNF-induced InBa degradation. We
also examined whether TGF-h1 inhibits TNF-induced NF-nB

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

transcriptional activity, and results showed that TGF-h1 pretreatment also inhibited TNF-induced NF-nB transcriptional activity
(Supplementary Fig. S4). To see the effect of TGF-h1 on TNFinduced caspase-3 activation as an apoptotic marker, HeLa cells
were pretreated with TGF-h1 for the indicated times followed by
treatment with TNF for another 24 h. Treatment of TNF or TGF-h1
alone did not induce caspase-3 activation significantly, but
pretreatment of TGF-h1 markedly increased the apoptotic activity
of TNF (Fig. 4B). Expression of Smad7 was increased in accordance
with treatment of TGF-h1. Increased levels of Smad7 and enhanced
Smad2 phosphorylation were maintained even 48 h after TGF-h1
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). To see whether Smad7 induced
by TGF-h1 mediates inhibition of TNF-induced NF-nB transcriptional activity and apoptosis by TGF-h1, we used Smad7 siRNA to
reduce expression of endogenous Smad7 protein. The SMARTpool
Smad7 siRNA was used to knock down the endogenous expression
of human Smad7. HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of
Smad7 siRNA or scrambled siRNA. Low levels of Smad7 were
expressed in HeLa cells in the absence of TGF-h1. TGF-h1
treatment induced expression of Smad7 in HeLa cells transfected
with the control scrambled siRNA, whereas Smad7 protein levels
decreased by 80% when Smad7 siRNA was transfected. Knockdown
of Smad7 expression by the Smad7 siRNA transfection resulted in
an increase in TNF-induced InBa degradation even in the presence
of TGF-h1 (Fig. 4C). In accordance with the inhibitory activity of
Smad7 on TNF-induced NF-nB activation, knockdown of Smad7
blocked the synergistic activity of TGF-h1 on TNF-induced
caspase-3 activation as well as PARP degradation (Fig. 4D). This
result suggests that TGF-h1 can enhance TNF-induced apoptosis
through the inhibition of NF-nB activation.
Smad7 suppresses the expression of NF-KB antiapoptotic
target genes. The antiapoptotic function of NF-nB is dependent
on the expression of various target genes, such as XIAP, FLIP, and
cIAP-1. Here, we further examined whether Smad7 influences the

expression levels of those genes. Cells were treated with TNF for
24 h, the total RNA was prepared, and RT-PCR and Northern blot
were done (Fig. 5A and B). As shown in Fig. 5, TNF markedly
up-regulated the expression of XIAP, FLIP, and cIAP-1, whereas
Smad7 expression significantly reduced their expression levels.
XIAP, FLIP, and cIAP-1 are important antiapoptotic molecules (21),
and their reduced expression levels caused by Smad7 expression
are likely to contribute to the sensitization effect of Smad7 on
TNF-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Resistance to death signal of tumor cell is the most important
obstacles in treatment of many cancers (22, 23). It will be helpful
to find out the molecular targets to understand the mechanism
of resistance of tumor and to sensitize the tumor cell by treatment with reagents. Because activation of NF-nB plays a major
role to protect cells against apoptotic stimuli, such as TNF and Fas
ligand, it has been known as good therapeutic target for treatment of cancer (24). In this study, we have shown that Smad7
expression greatly sensitizes MCF7 and SNU638 cells to TNFinduced cell death, suggesting that inhibition of NF-nB–mediated
antiapoptosis signals may tip the balance in favor of TNFR1activated apoptotic signals. We have previously shown that
overexpression of Smad7 substantially suppresses TNF-induced
NF-nB activation (14). These findings are consistent with previous
reports that induction of Smad7 inhibits transcriptional activity of
NF-nB in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and in conditionally
immortalized mouse podocytes (25, 26). Transfection with Smad7specific siRNA increased TNF-induced NF-nB transcriptional activity, showing that endogenous Smad7 acts as a negative modulator
in TNF signaling.
Activation of the JNK pathway is critical for TNF-induced
apoptosis (18). We have also shown that the JNK pathway is important for TNF-induced cell death in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3A). Although
the activation of JNK is important for TNF-induced apoptosis,
there were no significant differences in TNF-induced JNK activity
between control and Smad7-expressing MCF7 cells, suggesting that
Smad7 does not activate JNK (Fig. 3B). A recent report showed that
the ubiquitination and translocation of TRAF2 to the insoluble
fraction is critical for activation of JNK but not of p38 or NF-nB
(27). However, Smad7 does not regulate the TNF-induced TRAF2
ubiquitination (14). In addition, RIP-deficient mice showed extensive
apoptosis in both the lymphoid and adipose tissue and died at 1 to
3 days after birth. Rip1 / MEF cells are highly sensitive to TNFinduced cell death, which is caused by a failure to activate NF-nB,
but not JNK (28). We found that Smad7 has no effect on RIP1 activity
(14). Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is involved in TNFinduced JNK activation through the interaction with TRAF2 (29).
However, the effect of Smad7 on ASK1 activation is not known.
The relationship between TNF and TGF-h is important in
apoptosis, inflammation, and cancer. In the TGF-h1–null mouse,
the infiltration of mononuclear cells into vital organs is
accompanied by the overexpression of IFN-g and inducible nitric
oxide synthase, and the resulting toxic levels of nitric oxide
contribute to the lethal phenotype of the TGF-h1–null mice
(30, 31). NF-nB activity is markedly increased in inflamed tissue
and is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD; ref. 32) and rheumatoid arthritis (33, 34), making this
factor a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In cell culture
systems, TGF-h can either promote or inhibit NF-nB activation
depending on the cell type used (35–38). TGF-h treatment of WEHI
231 and CH33 cells reduced nuclear Rel/NF-nB activity in part by
an increase in the InBa protein resulting from increased gene
transcription (35). TGF-h is also a negative regulator of NF-nB in
human intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (39). Pretreatment of normal lamina propria mononuclear cells with TGF-h
blocked TNF-induced NF-nB p65 accumulation in the nucleus, and
this was associated with induction of InBa. Recent study has
shown that induction of InBa by Smad7, thereby inhibiting NF-nB
activation and NF-nB–driven inflammatory response, may be a key

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

signaling pathway whereby TGF-h exerts its anti-inflammatory
properties in vivo and in vitro (40). In addition, TGF-h and TNF can
cooperate to induce apoptosis in several cell lines consistent with
our result (41, 42).
Smad6 and Smad7 have been identified as inhibitors of the
TGF-h, activins, and BMP signaling pathway, and inhibitory Smads
function by interfering with the activation of receptor-regulated
Smads through interaction with TGF-h type I receptor or other
Smad proteins. Smad7 expression is rapidly induced by TGF-h
family members in several cell types, indicating that Smad7 is in
feedback regulation of TGF-h signaling. Recent studies suggest that
Smad7 may serve as mediator of TGF-h in the cell rather than
acting simply as an inhibitor of TGF-h signaling. In scleroderma,
basal level and TGF-h–inducible expression of Smad7 are selectively decreased, and the introduction of Smad7 restores normal
TGF-h signaling in scleroderma fibroblasts (43). In contrast,
another study reported that scleroderma fibroblasts exhibited
increased Smad7 levels compared with normal fibroblasts in vivo
and in vitro (44). In T cells of IBD patients, increased Smad7
expression causes the blockade of TGF-h signaling and antiinflammatory effects (45). Moreover, ectopic expression of Smad7
has been shown to induce apoptosis (25). In addition, expression
of Smad7 in JygMC(A) cells decreased in metastasis to the lung and
liver. This effect may be associated with increased expression of
components of adherens and tight junctions, decreased expression
of N-cadherin, and decreases in the migratory and invasive abilities
of the JygMC(A) cells (46). These observations suggest that Smad7
is not simply an inhibitor of signaling pathways of TGF-h family
members but may also function as a mediator of TGF-h signaling
pathway(s). In this study, we have provided evidence that Smad7
may function as a scaffold protein of the cross-talk between
two different signaling pathways (Fig. 5C). Smad7, induced by
TGF-h, an anti-inflammatory signal, blocks the activation of NF-nB,
which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF or
interleukin-1h (47). On the other hand, the TGF-h signaling can be
inhibited by Smad7, which is induced by the TNF and IFN-g
through NF-nB and signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways. Therefore, the balance between different signals and
the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways seems to be
important in cell fate for survival or cell death.
Because Smad7 sensitizes TNF-mediated apoptosis through the
inhibition of TNF-mediated NF-nB activation, pharmacologic
augmentation of Smad7 expression may be a useful therapeutic
strategy in tumors that express high level of TNF. In previous
report, halofuginone is known to induce expression of Smad7
dramatically and reduce the radiation-induced fibrosis (48).
Interestingly, halofuginone has been shown to inhibit tumor
growth through the blocking of angiogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase (49, 50). It will be interesting to screen the chemicals
that induce the specific expression of Smad7 and examine the
effect of chemicals whether it has proapoptotic activity through the
induction of Smad7 in tumors.
