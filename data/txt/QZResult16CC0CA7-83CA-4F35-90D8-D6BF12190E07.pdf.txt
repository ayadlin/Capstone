Abstract
The results from the randomized phase II BELOB trial provided evidence for a potential beneﬁt of bevacizumab (beva), a
humanized monoclonal antibody against circulating VEGF-A,
when added to CCNU chemotherapy in patients with recurrent
glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we performed gene expression proﬁling (DASL and RNA-seq) of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded tumor material from participants of the BELOB trial
to identify patients with recurrent GBM who beneﬁtted most
from bevaþCCNU treatment. We demonstrate that tumors
assigned to the IGS-18 or "classical" subtype and treated with
bevaþCCNU showed a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in progression-free
survival and a trend toward beneﬁt in overall survival, whereas
other subtypes did not exhibit such beneﬁt. In particular,

expression of FMO4 and OSBPL3 was associated with treatment
response. Importantly, the improved outcome in the bevaþCCNU treatment arm was not explained by an uneven
distribution of prognostically favorable subtypes as all molecular glioma subtypes were evenly distributed along the different
study arms. The RNA-seq analysis also highlighted genetic
alterations, including mutations, gene fusions, and copy
number changes, within this well-deﬁned cohort of tumors
that may serve as useful predictive or prognostic biomarkers of
patient outcome. Further validation of the identiﬁed molecular
markers may enable the future stratiﬁcation of recurrent GBM
patients into appropriate treatment regimens. Cancer Res; 76(3);

Introduction

carmustine), retreatment with (dose intense) temozolomide, reirradiation, and re-resection are treatments that are often used but
have limited activity (3). Progression-free survival (PFS) of recurrent GBM patients is in the range of 2 to 4 months, and postprogression survival of about 6 to 8 months, with conventional
chemotherapy (4).
GBMs are histologically characterized by endothelial proliferation and necrosis. At the molecular level, they are characterized
by hypoxia-induced and HIF1a-dependent upregulation of VEGF
production by tumor cells, which subsequently induces new
blood vessel formation (5). Because of the extensive endothelial
proliferation that characterizes GBM, soon after the discovery of
VEGF and its signiﬁcance for the angiogenesis of tumor growth it
has been hypothesized that GBM would provide a good target for
anti-angiogenic treatments.
In spite of some initially promising results in uncontrolled trials
however, recent data suggest that the effects of angiogenesis inhibition on overall survival (OS) is limited in both primary and
recurrent GBM patients (6–9). For example, bevacizumab (beva), a
humanized monoclonal antibody against circulating VEGF, failed
to demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement of survival in newly
diagnosed GBM patients in two large randomized phase III clinical
trials (10, 11). Similarly, cediranib, a pan VEGFR inhibitor, did not
improve outcome in recurrent GBM patients (12). Although the
overall effects of angiogenesis inhibition may be disappointing, it
is possible that subsets of patients do obtain some clinical beneﬁt

Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and aggressive
type of glial brain tumors (1). The current standard of care for
GBM patients includes surgical resection followed by combined
chemoirradiation with temozolomide (2). However, GBMs
invariably relapse and when this progression occurs, treatment
options are limited. Nitrosoureas (in particular lomustine and

(for examples in glioma, see refs. 13–16). For bevacizumab, gene
expression analysis provided preliminary evidence of beneﬁt in
distinct molecular subtypes of GBMs (17, 18)
Recently, results were reported for the BELOB trial, a trial from
the Dutch Neuro-Oncology Group (LWNO), in which patients
were randomly assigned to treatment with lomustine (CCNU),
bevacizumab or a combination of CCNU with bevacizumab
(beva/CCNU; ref. 19). The trial results were intriguing as they
indicate a potential survival beneﬁt of beva/CCNU in recurrent
GBM patients. In this study, we have performed gene expression
proﬁling and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on tumor samples
derived from patients treated within the BELOB trial to identify
recurrent GBM patients who beneﬁt from combined beva/CCNU
treatment. Our results show that of the different molecular subtypes of GBM (20, 21) "classical" GBMs or those assigned to IGS18 showed a trend toward beneﬁt from treatment; other subtypes
did not show such beneﬁt. When validated in an independent
dataset, our data will allow selection of recurrent GBM patients
that beneﬁt from beva/CCNU combination treatment.

Materials and Methods
Patients were eligible for the BELOB trial if they were 18 years
and had a ﬁrst recurrence of GBM after temozolomide and
radiotherapy treatment. Details of the study have been described
previously (19). We also selected 37 paired FF–formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) samples from the Erasmus University
Medical Center glioma tumor archive, with FF and the FFPE
samples taken as parallel biopsies from the same tumor. All of
the FF–FFPE sample pairs were described previously to assess the
performance of HuEx_1.0_St arrays (Affymetrix; refs. 20, 22). Use
of patient material was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the respective hospitals and patients provided written
informed consent according to national and local regulations for
the clinical study and correlative tissue studies.
Total RNA extraction, puriﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation from FF
and FFPE material were reported previously (22). Puriﬁed RNA
(250 ng) was used for labeling and hybridization on DASL
beadchips (run by Service XS); 500 ng was used for RNA-seq on
an Illumina TruSeq and approximately 35 to 40 million 40-base
paired end-reads were generated per sample. RNA-seq (n ¼ 96)
was run by Expression Analysis (Quintiles). DNA extraction was
performed using the Allprep FFPE DNA/RNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA expression
proﬁles were then assigned to one of six intrinsic molecular
subtypes of glioma (omitting IGS-0), or to one of four glioma
subtypes as deﬁned by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), using
the ClusterRepro R package (http://crantastic.org/packages/clusterRepro; ref. 23). Expression data are available at the NCBI Geo
datasets, accession number GSE72951.
Gene expression levels (Ref-seq genes) were extracted from the
RNA-seq data using featureCounts (24), after alignment on hg19
with Tophat2 (25) of clipped/trimmed reads as provided by the
manufacturer. VarScan 2 was used to identify SNVs and indels in
the RNA-seq data (26–28), Annovar was used to annotate the
SNVs (29). Candidate SNVs were ﬁltered for SNVs that are absent
in the 1000 genomes database and for changes that would result
in a change in the primary protein sequence. We further focused
on those that are either absent from dbSNP138 or are present in
the COSMIC database (30, 31). ANKRD36 was removed from this
analysis: 497 mutations in 94 samples were identiﬁed in this gene,

526 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

which is likely due to misalignment of homologous and/or nonrefseq genes (e.g., ANKRD36B or FLJ54441). Candidate fusion
genes were detected using ChimeraScan V0.4.5 on hg19 (32). RTPCR was used to conﬁrm fusion candidates, and Sanger sequencing was performed to conﬁrm genetic changes.
Differences between the Kaplan–Meier survival curves were
calculated using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test using GraphPad
Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). For all
analysis, OS and PFS were calculated from the point of ﬁrst
recurrence. The signiﬁcance of prognostic factors was determined
with a multivariate analysis using Cox regression. In this analysis,
treatment was coded as (i) beva/CCNU, (ii) CCNU, and (iii) beva.
Comparisons between frequencies were assessed by the Fisher
exact test or the c2 test (where indicated). SAM analysis was
performed using SAMR, an R package. The SAM approach to
identify genes associated with treatment response is similar to
previously reported using methylation arrays (33). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity IPA (Qiagen) using genes
differentially expressed between IGS-18 and all other subtypes at
P < 0.01 and >2-fold change in expression level.

Results
DASL and RNA-seq performance on FFPE samples and sample
assignment
As RNA isolated from samples that are ﬁxed in FFPE is degraded, we ﬁrst ran a series of tests to determine the suitability of using
DASL arrays and RNA-seq on FFPE-isolated RNA. In this analysis,
we compared performance of the two platforms between technical and biologic replicates, and compared the performance
between snap-frozen and archival samples that were stored >15
years in parafﬁn. Results are highlighted in Supplementary Figs.
S1 to S3. Our experiments demonstrate that both DASL beadchips
and RNA-seq can be used to perform gene expression proﬁling
and assignment to speciﬁc molecular subtypes using FFPE tissues,
even when the tissues were stored up to 20 years in parafﬁn.
Molecular subtypes of glioma in BELOB trial tumor samples
All available BELOB trial samples (114/152) were assigned to
molecular subtypes as deﬁned by "Gravendeel" (IGS-9, 17, 18, 22,
and 23) and "Verhaak" (proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal; Table 2; refs. 20, 21). The patient characteristics of tumor
samples included in the current study did not differ from the
entire BELOB patient cohort with respect to age, sex, performance
score, MGMT promoter methylation and survival (Table 1).
Material was unavailable for the remaining 38 tumor samples.
As can be expected, most samples were assigned to the prognostically unfavorable subtypes IGS-18 and IGS-23; GBMs are often
assigned to these molecular subtypes (Supplementary Table S3).
Few samples were assigned to the prognostically favorable subtypes IGS-9 and IGS-17. All subtypes, including the prognostically
favorable samples, were evenly distributed along the different
study arms, and the improved outcome in the beva/CCNU arm
therefore is not explained by a skewed distribution of these
samples. When samples were assigned according to the TCGA
classiﬁcation of GBMs, most samples are assigned to the TCGA
"classical" and "mesenchymal" subtypes and few to the "proneural" and "neural" subtypes (Table 2). From the point of ﬁrst
recurrence, the time point used for all analysis in current article,
the survival (both OS and PFS) between molecular subtypes was
not signiﬁcantly different (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Similar to previously reported, speciﬁc genetic changes segregate into distinct intrinsic subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S5). For
example, IDH1 mutations were present in eight BELOB tumor
samples (expression data are available for seven), and were
identiﬁed predominantly in prognostically favorable subtypes
IGS-9 (2/4, 50%), IGS-17 (3/9, 33%), and at much lower frequency in IGS-18 (1/72) and IGS-23 (1/28; P < 0.001 IGS-9þ17
vs. IGS-18þ23). Similarly, IDH1 mutations were predominantly
found in "proneural" GBMs (3/8). EGFR ampliﬁcation is a common event in IGS-18 and in "classical" GBMs (20, 34) and is
associated with mRNA upregulation and with an accumulation of
genetic changes in this locus (34). In the current dataset, samples
assigned to either IGS-18 or "classical" GBMs indeed have a
signiﬁcantly higher expression of EGFR (14.2 vs. 12.8 for IGS18 vs. any other subtype on DASL, P < 0.001 Students t test; data
are identical for "classical" vs. any other subtype). Samples
assigned to IGS-18 (or "classical" GBMs) also have a signiﬁcantly
higher frequency of genetic changes in the EGFR locus as determined by RNA-seq (31/47 in IGS-18 vs. 5/29 in any of the other
subtypes, P < 0.001, Fisher exact test). Similar for "classical" vs.
other GBMs: 34/51 vs. 2/24 (P < 0.001). The assignment of tumors
to speciﬁc molecular subtypes therefore corresponds to the histologic diagnosis (i.e., predominantly prognostically poor subtypes) and to the type of genetic changes found (i.e., speciﬁc
genetic changes segregate within deﬁned molecular subtypes).

Response to treatment
The molecular subtypes of gliomas identiﬁed in BELOB tumor
samples were then stratiﬁed according to treatment arm. In this
retrospective analysis, samples assigned to IGS-18 showed a trend
toward beneﬁt from the combination of beva and CCNU (median
OS 7.9, 8.3, and 11.9 months in the CCNU, beva, and beva/CCNU
arms, respectively; P ¼ 0.09; Fig. 1). This trend was absent when
grouping all samples not assigned to IGS-18 (median OS 10.1,
8.9, and 6.3 months in the CCNU, beva, and beva/CCNU arms,
respectively; P ¼ 0.85); too few samples were assigned to IGS-9,
IGS-17, IGS-22, or IGS-23 to assess treatment response in individual subtypes. A signiﬁcant beneﬁt in PFS was observed for
tumor samples assigned to IGS-18: survival of samples assigned to
IGS-18 was 1.4, 2.9, and 4.2 months in the CCNU, beva, and beva/
CCNU arms, respectively (P ¼ 0.0004); for non–IGS-18 samples it
was 2.8, 4.1, and 3.7 months (P ¼ 0.23; Fig. 1).
Analysis of subtypes deﬁned by the TCGA showed similar
results: "classical" GBMs showed a trend toward improved survival from the combination of beva and CCNU (median OS 8.2,
8.3, and 11.9 months in the CCNU, beva, and beva/CCNU arms,
respectively; P ¼ 0.097; median PFS 1.7, 3.0, and 4.2 months, P ¼
0.001; Supplementary Fig. S6). This trend was absent when
grouping all "non-classical" GBMs (median OS 8.7, 7.1, and
5.9 months in the CCNU, beva, and beva/CCNU arms, respectively; P ¼ 0.90; median PFS 2.7, 3.0, and 3.7; P ¼ 0.29); too few

Distinct molecular subtypes of GBM

both OS (A) and PFS (B). Tumors
assigned to other subtypes combined

samples were "mesenchymal," "proneural," or "neural" to assess
treatment response in individual subtypes. These data suggest
that recurrent GBM patients whose tumors are assigned to IGS-18
or are "classical" GBMs may beneﬁt from the combination of
bevacizumab and CCNU, whereas tumors assigned to other
subtypes do not show such beneﬁt.
We next aimed to identify genes and molecular pathways that
were associated with treatment response on OS. We ﬁrst per-

formed SAM analysis and identiﬁed two genes (FMO4 and
OSBPL3) that are associated with OS, speciﬁcally in the beva/
CCNU treatment arm (using a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.05).
SAM analysis failed to identify genes associated with survival in
the CCNU and bevacizumab monotherapy arms of this study. As
the two genes are associated with survival only in the beva/CCNU
treatment arm, these genes may be considered speciﬁcally associated with response to treatment (Fig. 2). Indeed, clustering

(FMO4 and OSBPL3) that are

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
based on these two genes separates
tumors in two major subtypes.

expression predicts response in the

samples based on FMO4 and OSBPL3 expression divided samples
in two major subtypes (Fig. 2). OS between the two subtypes was
similar for patients treated with either CCNU or bevacizumab
monotherapy (median survival of 8.3 vs. 8.5 and 6.1 vs. 10.1
months for CCNU and bevacizumab monotherapy, respectively;
P ¼ 0.57). However, survival between the two subtypes signiﬁcantly differed for patients treated with beva/CCNU (median
survival of 6.1 vs. 12.4 months; P < 0.0001). There is no difference
in gene expression levels of these two genes between the different
molecular subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Because tumors assigned to IGS-18 show a trend toward beneﬁt
from beva/CCNU, we also performed pathway analysis on genes
differentially expressed between IGS-18 and all other molecular
subtypes. Pathway analysis was performed using our previously
reported dataset containing snap-frozen tumor samples (20). A
total of 241 differentially expressed genes and 17 differentially
activated pathways were identiﬁed. Pathways included those that
are involved in, among others, cellular assembly, cancer, cellular
growth and proliferation. We then used the entire set of genes of
each individual pathway (also including genes not differentially
expressed between IGS-18 and other molecular subtypes) to
screen whether the pathway is associated with response to
beva/CCNU treatment. Four of these pathways were associated
with response to beva/CCNU treatment, the other 13 pathways
showed little association (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Fig. S7a and b). Functions of the four pathways associated
with response to beva/CCNU combination treatment were often
overlapping and include functional descriptors such as "cellular
assembly and organization," "growth and proliferation," and
"tissue/organ morphology."
Univariate analysis highlighted that in BELOB samples,
MGMT promoter methylation (P ¼ 0.01), IDH1 mutation
status (P ¼ 0.04), treatment (P ¼ 0.04), and FMO4/OSBPL3
expression (P < 0.0001) were factors signiﬁcantly correlated
with OS. It should be noted however that the study was
not powered to perform comparative analysis. Multivariate
analysis including these factors showed MGMT promoter methylation, treatment and FMO4/OSBPL3 expression as independent prognostic factors associated with OS (Table 3; Supplementary Table S5). The interaction between FMO4/OSBPL3
expression and treatment was signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the

notion that high FMO4/OSBPL3 expression is associated with
treatment response in the bev/CCNU arm.
Factors associated with PFS in a univariate analysis were
MGMT promoter methylation (P ¼ 0.004), IDH1 mutation status
(P ¼ 0.017), performance status (P ¼ 0.013), intrinsic subtype
(P ¼ 0.018), treatment (P ¼ 0.006), and FMO4/OSBPL3 expression (P ¼ 0.0004). Multivariate analysis including these factors
showed MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1 mutation status and
treatment as independent prognostic factors associated with PFS
(Table 4). The interaction between FMO4/OSBPL3 expression and
treatment was also signiﬁcant for PFS in this analysis, conﬁrming
the association of FMO4/OSBPL3 expression with bev/CCNU
treatment.
In patients of the TCGA database that received bevacizumab at
any time during the treatment, a nonsigniﬁcant tendency toward
increased survival was observed in tumors with high expression of
FMO4 or OSBPL3 (strongest in GBMs assigned to IGS-18: median
survival of 1.21 vs. 1.50 years for both FMO4 and OSBPL3;
Supplementary Fig. S9). High expression of FMO4 or OSBPL3
was not associated with increased survival in the entire TCGA
GBM dataset. We should stress that these data should be interpreted with caution: the number of patients receiving bevacizumab (and assigned to IGS-18) is small (n ¼ 18), patients did not
receive uniform treatment, and bevacizumab may have been
given at a time point different from the BELOB study.
Mutations and structural rearrangements
Mutation analysis using RNA-seq data identiﬁed a total of 45
mutations in 13 genes (out of the 71 genes frequently mutated in
GBMs (34) in 78 BELOB trial samples (Table 5). Genes include
EGFR (n ¼ 29, with often multiple mutations in a single sample),
PTEN (n ¼ 10, of which 4 result in a premature stop codon), TP53
(n ¼ 4), and NF1 (n ¼ 2). The frequency of most mutations is
slightly lower than previously reported (34) and can be explained
because many genes are expressed at low levels, especially when
one allele is lost as is the case in many tumor suppressor genes. In
addition, homozygous deletions will not be identiﬁed by RNAseq. However, a low frequency for several genes also reﬂects the
high number of "classical" GBMs in our dataset: PIK3CA, PIK3R1,
and TP53 mutations are common to "proneural" GBMs, and
NF1 mutations are common to "mesenchymal' GBMs (21). The

For many mutations in EGFR, the frequency was below the minimal allele
frequency used by VarScan. For this analysis, we also included hotspot mutations at low frequency.

One tumor harbored two mutations in NF1.
a

mutations per sample, along with the clinical data and molecular
subtype, are shown in Fig. 3. The type and frequency of mutations
identiﬁed corresponds to those reported previously for GBMs,
although RNA-seq is likely to underestimate the mutation frequencies in genes expressed at low level, particularly in tumor
suppressor genes (34, 35).
We also used RNA-seq to identify (large) chromosomal losses:
regions with chromosomal loss will be represented by RNA-seq as
regions absent in heterozygous SNPs. Allele-speciﬁc expression
will also be reﬂected as a region absent in heterozygous SNPs
(such as occurs in females on the X-chromosome), but this occurs
a minority of genes only (36). Our algorithm was tested by
comparing control samples, of which, SNP data were also present
from snap-frozen samples (Supplementary Fig. S10; see ref. 37).
The only frequent LOH observed was LOH of chromosome 10
and was observed at signiﬁcantly higher frequency in samples
assigned to IGS-18 (34/43, 79%) compared with IGS-23 (6/16,
38%) or other molecular subtypes (1/9, 11%, P < 0.001 c2 test).
ChimeraScan identiﬁed a total of 8,879 candidate fusion genes
(range, 12–209). Within the technical and biologic replicates, the
overlap in identiﬁed candidates was low (39.6  9.7%) but
improved signiﬁcantly when additional ﬁlters were applied
(at least 10 reads covering the breakpoint, of which at least
two chimeric reads), to 95%  9.2%. When applying these
ﬁlters to the entire dataset, and removing falsely called fusion
transcripts due to alternative splicing events and those that occur
in repetitive sequences, 28 candidate fusion genes remained
(Supplementary Table S6). These fusion candidates include the
known fusion genes FGFR3–TACC (n ¼ 2) and EGFR–SEPT14
(n ¼ 2; refs. 38–40). WIF1 and VSTM2A were identiﬁed as a novel
fusion partner of EGFR. All remaining fusion genes were unique
events, though some fusion partners (NUP107, VOPP1, GRB10,
LANCL2, MLLT3, and VSTM2A) were identiﬁed in two samples.
Fusion genes are incorporated, alongside with clinical and other
molecular data, in Fig. 3.
Fusion genes involving NUP107 surround the MDM2 locus,
and it is possible that they occur secondary to a high copy
ampliﬁcation of this locus (both samples express high levels of
MDM2). There are four samples with NUP107 fusion genes in the

530 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

TCGA dataset, all of which have high copy MDM2 ampliﬁcation
(34). By analogy, both PSPH and VOPP1 are located close to the
EGFR locus and, in the TCGA dataset, fusions involving PSPH or
VOPP1 are either associated with EGFR ampliﬁcation or are direct
fusion partner of EGFR.
Analysis of intronic reads can identify the genomic breakpoint
of fusion genes
Sequencing of total RNA results in a large proportion of intronic
reads (41). This is likely caused by the use of random primers for
cDNA synthesis; in random primed cDNA synthesis both the
mature and unspliced mRNAs are converted into cDNA. In
general, introns are spliced out only after transcription of the
entire intron. Therefore, on a population level, the 50 end of an
intron will have a higher read-depth than the 30 end (41). This is
particularly visible in transcripts with long introns (42), as the
half-life of an intron is determined by its length and by the rate of
RNA polymerase II transcription, approximately 3.5 to 4 kb/h (43,
44). Of note, we have observed exceptions to this rule, arguing for
intra-intronic splicing events (see Supplementary Fig. S11 for
some examples). Additional calculations on the rate of transcription and the level of expression are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S12.
We hypothesized that the presence of the pre-mRNA transcripts
can be used to identify intronic genomic breakpoints of fusion
genes: where in intact introns there is a relatively stable coverage of
pre-mRNA levels, the levels of pre-mRNA may suddenly change at
the exact genomic breakpoint of a fusion gene. Indeed, such
sudden decreases/increases of pre-mRNA levels are often present
in the introns of the fusion genes identiﬁed by ChimeraScan. PCR
using primers spanning the putative breakpoint conﬁrmed the
presence and location of the genomic break (Supplementary
Fig. S13).

Discussion
In this study, we have performed gene expression proﬁling and
RNA-seq on tumor material derived from patients treated within
the BELOB trial in order to identify recurrent GBM patients who
beneﬁt from combined CCNU and bevacizumab treatment. Our
results indicate that patients with a speciﬁc molecular subtype of
glioma, IGS-18, or "classical GBMs," may show more beneﬁt from
beva/CCNU treatment. In particular, the expression of FMO4 and
OSBPL3 are correlated with beneﬁt from this combination treatment. It should be noted however that our data analysis is post hoc,
and conﬁrmation in an independent dataset is therefore required.
The in-depth analysis of the transcriptome by RNA-seq also
highlighted genetic changes (mutations, indels, gene fusions—
including identiﬁcation of the exact genomic breakpoint—and
copy number changes, albeit with limited resolution) within this
well-deﬁned cohort of tumors.
Recently, data were reported on two large randomized phase
III clinical trials that investigated the role of the addition of
bevacizumab to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in newly
diagnosed GBM patients (10, 11). Unfortunately, the results
show that the combination treatment did not result in an
increased OS of patients. Subsequent translational research
however, did identify subgroups of patients that showed beneﬁt from beva þ temozolomide treatment (17, 18). For example, Sulman and colleagues provided evidence, in the RTOG
0825 study, that "mesenchymal" GBMs performed particularly

poor on the combination treatment (18). Although these data
were generated on newly diagnosed GBMs, our data on recurrent GBMs largely corroborate these ﬁndings: no trend toward
treatment beneﬁt was identiﬁed in "non-classical" GBMs (most
of which were mesenchymal tumors, though numbers are too
small to draw ﬁrm conclusions). Recently, Phillips and colleagues, in the AvaGlio study, demonstrated that G-CIMP- "proneural" GBMs beneﬁtted from beva þ temozolomide (17). Our
dataset, however, contains very few proneural GBMs, which
may be related to the observation that these tumors have the
worst prognosis of all GBM subtypes and may simply not
qualify for second-line treatment (34). Based on data provided
in this article, it would be interesting to see whether in those
studies tumors assigned to IGS-18 also show beneﬁt from the
addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy. Of note, in a recent
retrospective analysis, patients with tumors assigned to IGS-18
or classical GBMs had worse outcome than those assigned to
IGS-22/23 when treated with a combination of bevacizumab
and irrinotecan (45).
SAM analysis identiﬁed two genes that were associated with
survival speciﬁcally in the beva/CCNU combination arm. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 4 (FMO4) is a protein that
catalyzes the NADPH-dependent oxygenation of drugs, pesticides, and xenobiotics (46). FMO4 is part of a protein family
(FMO1-5) that, after cytochrome P450, is the second largest
protein family involved in drug metabolism. FMO oxidation
increases the polarity of (nitrogen-containing) substrates,
which aids excretion and detoxiﬁcation, but may also catalyze
drugs into more active forms. Because FMO4 expression is
involved in drug metabolism and is associated with survival
in the bevaþCCNU arm, it is possible that FMO4 expression
may render tumors more sensitive to CCNU treatment (when in
combination with bevacizumab).
OSBPL3 is one of the 12 members of the oxysterol binding
protein (OSBP) related protein (ORP) family that play a role in
lipid metabolism, vesicle trafﬁcking, and cell signaling (47).
OSBPL3 binds to the phosphoinositides PIP2 and PIP3 and can
interact with the small GTPase R-RAS (48, 49). OSBPL3 was
shown to play a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton
and cellular adhesion (49). Because a set of tumors respond to
bevacizumab by increased migration/invasion and vessel cooption (50, 51) and VEGF directly inhibits glioma invasion
(52), it is possible that increased OSBPL3 expression increases
cellular adhesion and so reduces the migratory capacity of tumor
cells. Perhaps a combination of altered migration and drug
metabolism renders tumors in the bevaþCCNU arm more sensitive to this treatment.
One of the peculiarities of our dataset is that it contained an
overrepresentation of tumors assigned to IGS-18 or "classical"
GBMs where, in general, GBMs are roughly equally distributed
across the various molecular subtypes (20, 21, 53, 54). We are
conﬁdent however of the molecular classiﬁcation as described in
this article: There was a high correlation in tumor assignment
between snap-frozen and FFPE samples and between different
methods (DASL and RNA-seq) and genetic changes in the EGFR
locus (and 10q LOH) are a hallmark of IGS-18 or "classical" GBMs
and most tumors assigned to IGS-18 or "classical" GBMs indeed
harbor genetic changes in this gene. This segregation of genetic
changes was also observed for IDH1. The higher frequency of
tumors assigned to IGS-18 or "classical" GBMs may reﬂect a
sample bias of current study. However, in a study analyzing EGFR

532 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

ampliﬁcation in matched primary and recurrent tumors, we also
ﬁnd a high frequency of EGFR ampliﬁcation at initial diagnosis
(70%; van den Bent and colleagues; submitted for publication).
It is therefore possible that (EGFR-ampliﬁed) tumors assigned to
IGS-18 are more prone to receiving re-treatment at tumor recurrence. For example, G-CIMP proneural GBMs are selected against
as they have poorest prognosis of all GBM subtypes (34).
A limitation of our study is the use of primary tumor tissue for
classiﬁcation, whereas the recurrent tumor was treated. In 2006, a
study identifying three molecular subtypes of glioma included
analysis of 26 (unselected) matched primary and recurrent tumor
pairs (54). This study showed that at progression, gliomas shift
from a proneural toward a mesenchymal subtype. However, it
also demonstrated that 18/26 (70%) tumors remain in the same
subtype (a similar retention of molecular subtype is observed
when these tumors to molecular subtypes as deﬁned by Gravendeel and colleagues; Supplementary Table S7). More speciﬁcally,
within the eight tumors assigned to IGS-18 at initial diagnosis in
this study, six remained in IGS-18 at tumor recurrence. A study
performed by our group included seven repeat samples and both
tumors assigned to IGS-18 at initial diagnosis remained in IGS-18
at tumor recurrence (20). Moreover, we have recently performed
analysis of the EGFR locus in 55 uniformly treated primary
recurrent tumor pairs (van den Bent and colleagues; submitted
for publication). EGFR ampliﬁcation can be used as surrogate
marker for IGS-18 tumors: retention of EGFR ampliﬁcation status
at tumor recurrence therefore is suggestive of retention of the
intrinsic glioma subtype. The data from this study indicate that the
EGFR status of the tumor remains similar at the point of recurrence in 47 of 55 matched tumor pairs. These studies suggest that
in many tumors, the molecular subtype largely remains identical
at tumor progression (even though they may shift toward a more
mesenchymal phenotype).
A second limitation of this study is that material was available
for only a subset (114/152) of BELOB trial samples. Although we
did not identify differences in patient characteristics of tumor
samples included versus not included (Table 1), the use of only a
subset of patients may have introduced a sample bias.
Recurrent fusion genes identiﬁed in our dataset (FGFR3–
TACC3 and EGFR–SEPT-14) were identiﬁed by others with similar
frequencies (34, 38, 39, 55). A recent analysis identiﬁed the
genomic landscape of fusion genes in 13 tumor types, including
GBMs (40). Two identical fusion genes (LANCL2–SEPT14 and
ZZEF1–ANKFY1) can be detected when overlaying the identiﬁed
fusions in that study with those reported here. Based on the
ampliﬁcation status of MDM2 and EGFR and the fact that they
are present as double minutes when ampliﬁed, we hypothesize
fusions involving NUP017, PSPH, or VOPP1 occur secondary to
high copy gene ampliﬁcation. If so, this implies that GBMs harbor
few functional fusion genes.
Apart from the recurrent fusions, many of the 50 and 30 fusion
partners were also identiﬁed by others (e.g., GRB10, LANCL2,
MLLT3, ASCC3, VOPP1, TERT, VSTM2A, PSPH, NUP107, and
LEMD3), some of which are found at signiﬁcant frequency
(GRB10, NUP107, VOPP1, TERT, PSPH; refs. 38–40, 55). One
of the potentially functional fusions partner is TERT: TERT fusions
can represent a method to increase telomerase activity, as alternative to the frequent TERT promoter mutations in GBMs (56).
A total of 7 samples (of which 2 GBMs) were recently identiﬁed
to contain TERT fusion genes. In all cases identiﬁed, TERT acted
as the 30 fusion partner, and all contained the telomerase

transcriptase domain (transcripts from exon 2 or 3 onward),
which argues against random occurrence of the fusion.
Many of the reads identiﬁed by RNA-seq of FFPE isolated
material mapped to intronic regions and represent pre-mRNA
species. Similar to previously reported, our data show that the
50 end of an intron has a higher read-depth than the 30 end, at
least in large introns (41). The 50 to 30 decline in intronic reads
is linear and is explained by a mechanism where introns are ﬁrst
entirely transcribed before being spliced out (41). However,
some genes have introns that are apparently spliced out before
transcription of the entire intron (i.e., intra-intronic splicing).
Apart from a basic insight into the mechanism of RNA maturation, we show that intronic reads can be used to map genomic
breakpoints of fusion genes.
In summary, our results show that tumors assigned to IGS-18 or
classical GBMs showed a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in PFS and a trend
toward beneﬁt in OS from bevaþCCNU treatment; other subtypes
did not show such beneﬁt. Expression of FMO4 and OSBPL3,
genes involved in drug metabolism and cell signaling, regulation
of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular adhesion were speciﬁcally
associated with treatment response. When validated in an independent dataset, our data will allow selection of recurrent GBM
patients that beneﬁt from bevaþCCNU treatment.
