Abstract
Purpose: The miniature biodegradable implant siG12D-LODER™ was inserted
into a tumor and released a siRNA drug against KRAS(G12D) along four months. This
novel siRNA based drug was studied, in combination with chemotherapy, as targeted
therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC).
Methods: An open-label Phase 1/2a study in the first-line setting of patients with
non-operable LAPC was initiated. In this study patients were assigned to receive a
single dose of siG12D-LODERs, in three escalating dose cohorts (0.025mg, 0.75mg
and 3.0mg). Gemcitabine was given on a weekly basis, following the siG12D-LODERTM
insertion, until disease progression. The recommended dose was further examined
with modified FOLFIRINOX. The follow up period was eight weeks and survival until
death.
Results: Fifteen patients with LAPC were enrolled. Among the 15 treated patients,
the most frequent adverse events observed were grade 1or 2 in severity (89%); five
patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 12 patients analyzed by CT
scans, none showed tumor progression, the majority (10/12) demonstrated stable
disease and two showed partial response. Decrease in tumor marker CA19-9 was
observed in 70% (7/10) of patients. Median overall survival was 15.12 months; 18
month survival was 38.5%.
Conclusions: The combination of siG12D-LODER™ and chemotherapy is
well tolerated, safe and demonstrated a potential efficacy in patients with LAPC.

INTRODUCTION

in adenocarcinoma of the human pancreas are gain-offunction mutations, in which most of these occur in codon
12. Among the codon 12 mutations the most abundant is
substitution of the Glycine for Aspartate (G12D) [9, 12,
13]. In PDAC cancer cells are addicted to expression
of the mutated KRAS [9, 14]. Still, more than 30 years
of research have not yielded a specific therapy directly
targeting mutated KRAS. The challenges are attributed to
the picomolar affinity of this oncogene for GTP/GDP [15,
16] and failure to target any relevant allosteric regulatory
sites. Recently, the maturing field of mRNA targeting by
RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a highly potent
alternative compared to the more general protein inhibition
approach. It was previously shown that suppression of
KRAS expression by RNAi led to growth inhibition of
PDAC cells in vitro and PDAC-originated tumors in vivo
in mice [17, 18].

Pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the
most common pancreatic neoplasm, responsible for 90%
of pancreatic cancer cases [1]. Until recently Gemcitabine
was considered the main treatment option. Recent progress
in the treatment of metastatic PDAC has been shown with
the addition of nab-paclitaxel to Gemcitabine [2] and the
introduction of FOLFIRINOX (Leucovorin, Fluorouracil,
Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin) [3]. FOLFIRINOX
substantially improves overall survival (OS) compared to
Gemcitabine, however, it has a high toxicity profile and
hence only suitable for a subset of patients. About 80%
to 85% of patients with pancreatic cancer have advanced
disease at the time of diagnosis, i.e. stage III (LAPC) or
stage IV (metastatic), and are not candidates for surgical
curative intervention. Several autopsy series demonstrated
that 30% of patients presenting with stage III disease died
without evidence of distant metastases [4].
Treatment options for LAPC include several
chemotherapy regimens (Gemcitabine, Gemcitabine
and Erlotinib, Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel, or
FOLFIRINOX) with or without radiation. It is still unclear
whether chemoradiation for LAPC patients is warranted.
Chauffert et al studied initial chemoradiotherapy
(intermittent Cisplatin and infusional 5-FU) followed
by Gemcitabine vs. Gemcitabine alone in patients with
LAPC and observed a median survival of 8.6 months for
the chemoradiation arm vs. 13 months for chemotherapy
alone [5]. Loehrer et al. showed that treatment of
patients with Gemcitabine alone or with radiation led to
survival of 9.2 and 11.1 months respectively [6]. Herman
et al. demonstrated that treatment of LAPC patients
with chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy with concurrent
fluorouracil), with or without TNFerade, led to median
survival of 10.0 months in both treatment arms. Eighteen
month survival was 13.3% (standard of care (SOC))
vs. 18.2% (SOC+TNFerade) [7]. Progression Free
Survival (PFS) was 7.0 months (SOC) vs. 6.8 months
(SOC+TNFerade) and 18 month PFS was 6.6% (SOC) vs.
8% (SOC+TNFerade) [7]. Blazer et al. reported that nonresectable FOLFIRINOX-treated patients showed median
OS and PFS of 12.7 and 8 months respectively [8].
Epithelial carcinogenesis is typically associated
with the accumulation of mutations and genetic lesions,
leading to the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes. Mutated KRAS was proposed to
be a hallmark of pancreatic cancer [9] since this protein
is mutated in more than 90% of PDACs [10]. Mounting
literature data suggest that the KRAS mutations may be
early events in the molecular pathological cascade leading
to PDAC [11]. The vast majority of KRAS mutations

RNAi-based anti-mutated KRAS treatment for
patients with LAPC
To address the unmet need for an efficient nontoxic treatment for patients with LAPC, and to convert
the potential of RNAi into an anti-cancer therapy,
Silenseed Ltd. has developed the LODERTM (Local Drug
EluteR). LODERTM presents a novel solution to the major
challenges of oligonucleotide therapeutics and RNAi for
a large number of diseases including solid tumors. Such
challenges include delivery of RNAi-based drugs and
achievement of prolonged activity at a tolerated dose
at the target site. The siG12D-LODERTM is a miniature
biodegradable polymeric matrix that encompasses antiKRASG12D siRNA (siG12D). siG12D-LODERTM is
designed to provide a slow and prolonged local drug
release within the tumor over several months, while
ensuring protection of the siRNA drug from degradation.
It can be inserted and placed into pancreatic tumor
using a standard endoscope ultrasound (EUS) biopsy
procedure. Here, we present the use of siG12D-LODERTM
as a new therapeutic modality targeting mutated KRAS
in combination with the currently available treatments
including Gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX.
Our treatment of LAPC with siG12D-LODERTM
is based on accumulated pre-clinical evidence [19].
The results of these studies proved that (a) siG12DLODERTM efficiently overcomes current siRNA delivery
obstacles related to systemic delivery; (b) the LODER’s
pharmacokinetics (PK) enable dose reduction by orders
of magnitudes and eliminates toxicity; (c) the strategy
of local KRAS targeting by siG12D-LODERTM can be
effectively used to inhibit PDAC cell proliferation [19].
On the basis of these promising pre-clinical results,
a first in-human Phase 1/2a clinical study of siG12DLODERTM in combination with chemotherapy was
initiated for patients with locally advanced PDAC. The

slowed as demonstrated in diverse in vivo mice models
(subcutaneous and orthotopic), following implantation
of siG12D-LODERTM and the mice survival rates were
significantly improved [19]. In siG12D-LODERTM-treated
tumor tissue, apoptosis of tumor cells and tissue necrosis
were found to be widespread after typically one week in
the entire tumor (reference 19 and Figure 2B).
In addition to local effects on the tumor, we have
shown in preclinical studies that siG12D slows tumor
cell migration (Supplementary Figure 1C) and inhibits
Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) (data not
shown). Consistent with the above observations, we
have found that mice treated with siG12D-LODERs did
not develop metastases as compared with two thirds of
untreated controls and empty-LODERTM-treated groups,
which developed metastases (Supplementary Figure 1D).
The siG12D dosage in humans was selected based
on the in vivo results in mice (Supplementary Figure
1A-1B). We have estimated a maximum dose of 3mg of
siRNA above which RNAi saturation occurs.
siG12D-LODERTM also affects the second most
abundant KRAS mutation, G12V, which implies that the
siG12D-LODERTM efficacy is not restricted to the G12D
mutation (data not shown). We further showed that siG12D
provides additive benefit when used concomitantly with
SOC chemotherapy, i.e. Gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX
(Supplementary Figure 2A-2B).
Systemically, the dose levels of the siG12D in the
peripheral circulation are below detection levels, making
measurements of (systemic) pharmacokinetics (PK)
and pharmacodynamics (PD) impractical. However, the
pharmacokinetics of siG12D drug in the tumor tissues can
be assessed in vivo. We have studied PK and drug transport
in a subcutaneous pancreatic tumor model. The amount
of intercellular siG12D molecules that penetrate into
cells was assessed by detection of antisense strand of the

primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability
as well as to define a recommended phase 2b dose (RP2D)
of siG12D-LODERTM. Secondary objectives included
measuring the efficacy potential of siG12D-LODERTM
(though limited by a single dosing design), the antitumor
effects on the basis of tumor response, CA19-9 levels,
Time To Metastasis (TTM), PFS and OS.

RESULTS
LODERTM characteristics
LODERTM is a miniature biodegradable matrix
designed by Silenseed, allowing slow and prolonged local
release of the encapsulated drug. LODERTM was developed
to be inserted and placed into solid tumors using a standard
biopsy procedure. siG12D-LODERTM was designed to
release anti-KRASG12D siRNA (siG12D) within the
pancreatic tumor for four months. siG12D-LODERTM
was shown to efficiently protect the encapsulated siRNA
against enzymatic degradation, while releasing the drug
within a tumor in vivo in mice (reference 19 and Figure
2A). The selected LODERTM matrix components are all
FDA Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) materials,
and the active agent siG12D was found to be non-toxic
in all doses in vivo. Serial histopathological examination
demonstrated that the drug covers the entire tumor mass
typically within a week (Figure 2). Our data are consistent
with previous evidence of uptake of naked siRNA within
solid tumors [20]. Direct effects of KRAS expression
inhibition on the mRNA and protein levels, as well as
indirect effects of inhibition of tumor growth and induction
of tumor cell death, were detected in the entire tumor
mass (reference 19 and Figure 2B). Tumor growth was

molecule in the treated tissue using absolute quantitative
Real-Time PCR. siG12D molecules were detected at
distances extended by typical velocity of 1mm/day until
complete tumor coverage after a week. For example, in
mouse subcutaneous model tumors of more than 1.7 cm
in diameter were covered by siG12D molecule within a
week (Figure 2A and data not shown). The PK results after
a month are similar to the results after 7 days (data not
shown), confirming a steady state of the drug distribution
from LODERTM. These direct measurements of the drug
transport to extended distances are in line with results of
the drug effect on the entire tissue. For example, Figure
2B presents tumor tissue necrosis detected in the entire
tumor area one week after siG12D-LODERTM implantation
(in this example, the tumor is extended to about 1.7cm in
diameter).
Shemi et al (in preparation, 2015) explores these
results and their implications on drug transport in human
solid tumors. They proposed a transport model which
simulated drug delivery rates and demonstrated that drug
delivery originating at the inner core of a tumor differs
from systemic delivery. In systemic delivery drugs (or
nanocarriers) need to cross the artery walls and penetrate
into the inner tumor upstream, against the interstitial fluid
pressure gradient. The transport of siRNA drug from the
LODERTM surface into the entire tumor tissue was analysed
and was explained by convection dominated transport
(Péclet number > 1, where the Péclet number reflects the
rate of convection of a flow to its rate of diffusion). The
drug is distributed from the inner core outwards in the
tortuous tissue with effective velocity of 1mm/day, and
reaches the entire tumor mass in approximately one week.

The demographic and baseline characteristics of the
study subjects in each treatment group are presented in
Table 1. The median patient age was 70 years (range 52.185.3), where 30% of patients were above age of 74. Fifteen
patients with locally advanced PDAC were enrolled across
three dose levels: 0.025mg, 0.75mg and 3.0mg. Of these,
four patients received a low dose 0.025mg of siG12DLODERTM, four patients received 0.75mg (i.e. 0.375mg x 2
siG12D-LODERTM) and seven received 3mg (i.e. 0.375mg
x 8 siG12D-LODERTM) (Figure 1A). Fourteen of the
patients received concurrent SOC and one patient received
no chemotherapy (Table 1). All 15 patients completed the
study. Two patients were omitted from study but followed
for safety due to metastatic disease detected on day one
post siG12D-LODERTM implant imaging. The average age
of the study subjects at screening was 68.8 ± 9.0 years
(range: 52.1-85.3). Eight subjects were males (53.3%).

Concomitant chemotherapy
Nine patients received concomitant Gemcitabine as
SOC (50.0% of patients in the low treatment group, all
patients in the mid-treatment group and 42.9% of patients
in the high-treatment group). One patient received the
Gemcitabine + Erlotinib + Oxaliplatin combination
and one patient refused to receive any concomitant
chemotherapy during the study. Four patients in the hightreatment (57.1%) group received modified FOLFIRINOX
(Table 1).

(grade 3 cholangitis) was considered as definitely related
to the study procedure, as it was observed one day after
procedure. To note, the single grade 3 AE related to
pancreatitis, which was reported as ‘possibly related’
to the study procedure, seems to be unlikely related
to procedure as it was identified 23 days after siG12DLODERTM implantation. In general, our experience both
in animals [19] and humans is that there are no signs of
pancreatitis. Even in cases where patients had previous
resection (partial pancreatectomy), there is very rarely
pancreatitis.
Six drug possibly-related AEs (Table 2) were
reported by two patients (14.3%) in the 3mg treatment
group. In one patient the two reported AEs (abdominal
pain and constipation) were of grade 1 and were defined
one day after siG12D-LODERTM implantation. Four
remained drug possibly-related AEs were reported by
one patient and occurred 11 days post siG12D-LODERTM
implantation and four days after initiating FOLFIRINOX.
Of these, one was grade 2 renal failure. The remaining
three AEs (grade 4 pancytopenia and grade 3 abdominal
pain and colonic obstruction), were considered as possibly

No DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicity) events were
observed during the study. No MTD (Maximal Tolerated
Dose) was observed in the study. All 15 patients reported
a total of 125 AEs. 111 of reported AEs (89%) were grade
1 and 2, which were transient and resolved. The most
common AEs (grade 1-2) were diarrhea and abdominal
pain which were reported by seven patients (46.7%),
nausea and fatigue were reported by six (40%) and five
(33.3%) patients respectively. 13 grade 3 and one grade
4 severe AEs were reported by 10 (66.7%) subjects.
The most common grade 3-4 AEs were neutropenia
and cholangitis reported by 3 patients and 2 patients
respectively.
AEs were separately analyzed as “procedurerelated” and “drug-related” (Table 2). Eight procedurerelated AEs (Table 2) were reported by four patients
(26.7%), of them, seven AEs were reported by three
patients in the 3mg treatment group and one in the
0.025mg treatment group. Three procedure-related AEs
in two patients were grade 1-2 (38%). Only one AE

related to the study procedure and possibly related to the
FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, while are unlikely to be
related to the siRNA drug itself, as concluded by the Data
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Overall, siG12D was
safe and well tolerated in doses of up to 3mg.

The TTM was over 5.16 months in all patients.
Median TTM was 8.25 months with 95% CI of 7.20 to
11.40 months. At 18 months TTM was 15.4%. Data
is based on predictive Kaplan-Meier analysis valid to
December 2014, (Figure 3B). Significant differences of
TTM between the three dose groups were not observed.
In FOLFIRINOX-treated group, median TTM was 22.65
months.
In particular, we present a case of one of the
patients from the low dose group. The patient initiated
Gemcitabine chemotherapy 16 days after the siG12DLODERTM implantation. The treatment was well tolerated,
with no significant side-effects. The serum-based tumormarker CA19-9 decreased by 22.4% following the
siG12D-LODERTM implantation before the administration
of the first line chemotherapy treatment, and eventually
reached normal values (Figure 4B). This patient then
received local radiation treatment. A CT scan performed
nine months post insertion of siG12D showed a significant
decrease in tumor size (Figure 4A). This patient had 17.03
months TTM and died 18.21 months after enrollment to
the study.

Efficacy
Efficacy results in this study are based on single
dosing only (without repeat dosing after four months).
Median OS for all patients was 15.12 months with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of 10.19 to 18.44 months. One
year, 18 months and two years survival were 53.8%, 38.5%
and 15.4% respectively. Data are based on predictive
Kaplan-Meier analysis, valid to December 2014, where
two (from Cohort III) out of 13 patients were still alive
(Figure 3A). The first patient to die was after 7.36 months.
Significant differences of OS between the three dose
groups were not observed. Of note, in FOLFIRINOXtreated group (n = 3), median OS was longer than 27
months (while submitting this manuscript, two patients
are alive, more than 27 and 30 months).
None of the patients showed tumor progression
(PFS) at all analyzed time points (Figure 5).

and the highest dose administered and well tolerated was
3mg. Most AEs were grade 1 and 2, transient, and not
related to the study drug or to the study procedure. In the
3mg treatment group, the AEs were related to either the
implantation procedure, or the chemotherapy treatment
(FOLFIRINOX).
The results of the Phase 1/2a study demonstrated
a median OS of 15.12 months, a median TTM of 8.25
months; 18 months OS was 38.5% and TTM 15.4%.
Most patients had stable disease and two patients had
demonstrated partial responses. Six to 8.5 months after
LODERTM insertion, 60% of the patients of whom CT data
is available achieved partial response, and 40% had stable
disease. No dose response was observed between the dose
of siG12D and OS or TTM. Of note, two patients from the
high dose group are still alive (27 and 30 months).
In this study we present the affectivity of LODERTM
for RNAi based treatment for solid tumors. Our strategy
combines selection of cancer-driver target with prolonged
delivery to cancer cells. The LODERTM platform is
based on encompassing of siRNA within a miniature
biodegradable polymeric matrix that protects and enables
the release of the siRNA drug for an extended duration
of time regionally within tumor tissue. The LODERTM is
specifically designed to be inserted with existing EUS
biopsy procedures. We showed the efficacy of siG12D
drug, and that the innovative siG12D-LODERTM delivery
system is efficient, site-specific, and safe.
In summary, the concomitant administration of
siG12D-LODERTM and chemotherapy was safe and
well tolerated. The prolonged clinical benefit warrants
further evaluation of this agent in combination with
chemotherapy. A multinational randomized Phase 2b
clinical trial is currently in progress (NCT01676259).

Figure 5A and 5B display CT response in the
longest diameter (LD, based on direct measurements) and
in volume (based on 3D reconstruction), respectively, of
tumors in 12 patients at 2 months following the siG12DLODERTM insertion and after approximately four months
and 6-8.5 months in patients were data was available.
Measurements of changes in LD show that none of the
tumors progressed according to RECIST1.1 (above
20%); two patients showed decrease in LD below 30%.
Analysis at four months and at 6-8.5 months after the
procedure showed that two of eight (25%) and three of
five (60%) patients achieved partial response, respectively.
Two patients (13.3%) had stable disease (one each in the
0.75mg and the 3mg treatment groups). To note, none of
the patient for whom CT data is available showed tumor
progression (LD>20%) in the first 8 months (PFS = 100%
at the first ~6-8 months). Figure 5B shows a significant
decrease in tumor volume in most patients.

Post-therapy CA19-9 changes
At enrollment, abnormal elevated tumor marker
CA19-9 levels (>37 U/mi) were found in 10 patients
among the 13 patients who were analyzed for efficacy.
Decrease of >20% is significant, following Ziske et al.’s
report demonstrating that the decrease of CA19-9 >20%
after 8 weeks of chemotherapy is able to separate patients
into groups with significantly different survival times
[21]. In this study, decrease in tumor marker CA19-9 was
observed in 70% of patients (7/10). The data of 8-weeks
follow-up showed significant decrease in all the 7 patients
(Figure 5D).

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS

DISCUSSION

The Phase 1/2a study (NCT01188785) was
conducted at three medical centers in Israel, namely
the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, the
Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, Ein Kererm
Jerusalem, and the Shaare Zedek Hospital, Jerusalem. The
siG12D-LODERTM polymeric implants were provided by
Silenseed Ltd. Patients were enrolled between July, 2010
and May, 2012 in accordance with the principles of Good
Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The
protocol was approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health
and Local Institutional Review Boards, and patients
provided written informed consent before participation.

Pancreatic cancer is still one of the major challenges
in clinical oncology. Mutant KRAS is a driving oncogene
in the majority of human pancreatic cancer cases [14].
We have met this challenge by developing a
therapeutic platform for local and prolonged delivery
of siRNA. Our report describes an efficient, clinically
applicable siRNA delivery method that overcomes the
major obstacles of toxicity and organ accessibility.
Notably, our approach enabled the conversion of KRAS
from a non-druggable to a potentially druggable cancer
target.
The present study evaluated single administration of
three escalating doses of siG12D together with standard
of care chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced
inoperable pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoints
were to evaluate the safety and toxicity of siG12D in
combination with chemotherapy. No DLTs were observed
during the study, therefore no MTD could be determined,

weeks). Active follow-up period was eight weeks after
placement of siG12D-LODERTM and long-term survival
follow-up was performed until death. After two months,
CT scan was performed as a SOC at each study site; the
results were presented in a blinded to the sponsor for
analysis.

Study design

Efficacy measurements

This study was an open label, escalating single dose
Phase 1/2a multi-center trial. Men and women ≥18 years
old diagnosed with non-operable PDAC or with high
evidence of PDAC with no evidence of distant metastasis
were screened for eligibility. Metastases presence was
assessed by CT scan. Adenocarcinoma of pancreas was
confirmed by biopsy.
In this study, single dosing (single time) of escalating
doses of siG12D-LODERTM (0.025, 0.75 and 3mg) were
administered by a standard procedure EUS guidance.
siG12D-LODERs were inserted into the tumor using
the FDA approved equipment, namely EchoTip® Ultra
(Cook Medical) or the equivalent Expect 19 Flex Biopsy
needle (Boston Scientific) (Figure 1). After insertion
patients were monitored carefully for signs of systemic
or local treatment-related toxicity. Scheduled physical and
clinical examinations, vital signs (estimated by Karnofsky
performance status (PS)), laboratory tests, tumor marker
CA19-9, abdominal CT and disease assessments were
performed during the course of the trial. Following the
siG12D-LODERTM insertion Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV
was given on a weekly basis until disease progression. One
patient received Gemcitabine + Erlotinib + Oxaliplatin
(1000mg/m2, 100mg and 100mg/m2 IV respectively) for
3 weeks, followed by Gemcitabine alone, 1000mg/m2
IV on a weekly basis. The RP2D (recommended Phase
2b dose) was further examined in highest dose cohort in
combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (Oxaliplatin
85mg/m2, Irinotecan 150mg/m2 followed by a Fluorouracil

Antitumor activity was assessed based on changes
in CA19-9 and imaging. Changes were based on RECIST
1.1 criteria. Imaging was performed at baseline and at 12
weeks, and in most patients subsequently after 4 months
and 6 months. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined
based on the CT data (based on RECIST1.1) as the first
time to show longest diameter (LD) > 20%. Overall
survival (OS) was defined from the date of diagnosis until
death from any cause. TTM was defined from the date of
diagnosis until detection of metastasis. Data is based on
predictive Kaplan Meier analysis valid until December
2014, when two (from Cohort III) out of 13 patients
were still alive, and one having not demonstrated disease
progression (after 27 months).

Safety assessments
Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE), Version 4.0. A minimum of four patients were
entered at each dose level. All four subjects were followed
until they completed the cycle of therapy and subsequent
enrolment of new cohorts was based on the toxicity
assessment in that first cycle and the documentation of
any dose limiting toxicities. A two week gap was enforced
between cohorts. Before opening the next higher dose
level, all toxic effects at the preceding dose level were
reviewed and expansion or escalation was undertaken
as appropriate. Meetings between investigators were
organized as required.

Statistical analysis
All measured variables and derived parameters
were listed individually and, if appropriate, tabulated by
descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics and summary
tables were provided giving sample size (n), absolute and
relative frequency of categorical variables and sample
size, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient
of variation (if appropriate), median, minimum and
maximum percentiles and 95% confidence interval (CI)
for means of continuous variables. All two-tailed statistical
tests with a P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. All
adverse events were classified by System Organ Class and

preferred terminology according to MedDRA dictionary
and were summarized in cross tables by severity and dose
group. All tests applied were two-tailed, and P values ≤
0.05 were considered significant. The data were analyzed
using the SAS® software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina).
