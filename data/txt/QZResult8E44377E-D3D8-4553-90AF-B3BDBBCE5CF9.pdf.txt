ABSTRACT
Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with no mutations in exons 9,
11, 13, and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were defined
as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type and they accounted for ~15–20% of GISTs. However, some
KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs with KIT mutations in other exons were occasionally
reported. We therefore assessed GISTs to understand the whole genomic genotypes
of KIT or PDGFRA genes in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs.
Methods: A cohort of 185 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs from 1,080 cases was
retrospectively assessed. Thirty-nine patients were excluded due to insufficiency of
genomic DNA data or failure of library preparation, and 146 patients were analyzed
by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) followed by validation.
Results: For hot spots in KIT and PDGFRA genes, 23 out of 146 KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type cases carried mutations according to NGS; there were 19 KIT mutations
and 4 PDGFRA mutations, and these were exclusive. Intratumoral KIT mutational
heterogeneity was observed in 4 of 19 samples which potentially triggered
mechanisms of polyclonal evolution and metastasis and drug sensitivity. Eleven
patients treated with imatinib were evaluable for clinical response, and 2 of 3 patients
with KIT mutations achieved partial response (PR), while only 1 of 8 patients without
KIT mutations reached PR.
Conclusion: NGS had the potential property to identify partial mutant tumors
from a subset of GISTs regarded as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type tumors using Sanger
sequencing, and provided a better understanding of KIT/PDGFRA genotypes as well
as identified patients eligible for imatinib therapy.

INTRODUCTION

guidelines, GISTs with no mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and
17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, and 18 of the PDGFRA
gene are defined as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs, and
they represent 15–20% of GISTs [3]. However, pathogenic
mechanisms and molecular characteristics of KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GISTs are poorly understood. Recently, frequent
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations were identified
in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs, especially in pediatric
patients, which was considered a subtype of GISTs [4, 5].

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most
common mesenchymal tumor of gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
but they are relatively uncommon ~10–20 per GISTs per
million people [1]. The major mechanisms of tumorigenesis
of GISTs are oncogenic mutations of the KIT or PDGFRA
genes and these account for 80–90% of GISTs [2].

Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is the only first-line
drug for GIST treatment and efficacy depends on KIT
or PDGFRA genotypes [6, 7]. Drug response in KIT/
PDGFRA wild-type patients is poor and data show that
70% of these patients are resistant to imatinib. Thus,
~30% of KIT/PDGFRA wild-type patients may benefit
from imatinib, suggesting susceptible factors in wild-type
individuals or that some mutations are not detected with
current sequencing methods.
Several studies have explored possible mechanisms
of imatinib resistance and GIST pathogenesis. Miranda’s
group reported that KRAS and BRAF mutations existed
in GIST patients that these predicted imatinib resistant
in in vitro experiments [8]; however, no KRAS mutation
was found in a cohort of 514 cases [9]. PTEN-deficient
expression and PI3K/AKT pathway activation were
shown to be important to imatinib resistance [10, 11]. A
subset GISTs tested in vitro had KIT mutations in exon 8,
and these cells were sensitive to imatinib [12]. To explore
unknown mutations and possible pathogenic mechanisms
of KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs, we sequenced KIT and
PDGFRA genes and critical molecules downstream of these
genes using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS).

gene set with a median variant of 2 (range: 0–34;
Supplementary Figure S3). For 48 captured genes,
TP53 (43.15%), ROS1 (20.55%), NF1 (19.86%), ATRX
(19.86%), and KIT (19.18%) were the five most frequently
variants. Moreover, other variants with prevalence > 10%
were identified including BRCA2 (17.12%), BRAF
(16.44%), TSC1 (15.07%), MET (15.07%), F5 (13.01%),
DEPDC5 (13.01%), PDGFRA (12.33%), SLTM (11.64%),
KDR (11.64%), ALK (11.64%), and DDR2 (10.27%)
(Supplementary Figure S4). Whether these variants
participated in tumorigenesis of GISTs is unclear.

Variation profile of 48 genes based on
clinicopathological features
The heat maps of 48 genes based on different
features were analyzed using R software (Supplementary
Figure S5–S13). Data from hierarchical cluster analysis for
all patients (Figure S5) suggested the following stratified
cluster analysis based on sex (Figure S6), age (Figure S7),
tumor sites (Figure S8), tumor sizes (Figure S9), mitosis
(Figure S10), CD117 (Figure S11), DOG-1 (Figure S12),
and CD34 (Figure S13) expression. No obvious differences
in variation profile were noted among different features.

Patient characteristics
We studied 146 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type patients
and these data appear in Table 1. All patients had records
of primary tumor sites, tumor sizes and mitosis, however,
CD117, DOG-1, and CD34 expressions were collected from
139, 93, and 132 patients, respectively. Among 146 patients,
12 patients received imatinib palliative treatment after
diagnosis, 2 patients received imatinib neoadjuvant therapy
followed by surgery, 18 patients received imatinib adjuvant
therapy after surgery, 2 patients received sunitinib palliative
treatment when diagnosis, and the rest 112 patients received
surgery alone or no any treatment when diagnosis.

For hot spots for KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and
PDGFRA (exons 12, and 18) genes, 19 (13.0%) and 4
(2.7%) of 146 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs patients
carried KIT and PDGFRA mutations, respectively, with
a mutation ratio (mutratio, mutcount/coverage) less than
25%. The mutation types contained W557G (n = 1),
W557R (n = 2), V559D (n = 1), Del 557–558 (n = 3),
L576P (n = 6), Del 579 (n = 1) in exon 11 of KIT gene,
A814S (n = 1), N822K (n = 4) in exon 17 of KIT gene,
and R585K (n = 1) in exon 12 of PDGFRA gene, D842V
(n  =  2), D842Y (n = 1) in exon 18 of PDGFRA gene
(Table 2). These mutations were mutually exclusive, and
all mutation types in exon 11, N822K in exon 17 of the
KIT gene, and D842V in exon 18 of the PDGFRA gene
were frequently reported in GISTs. Based on our previous
large scale analysis [13], only one mutation type codon
(a 502–503 duplication) was found in exon 9 of the KIT
gene. No mutation in exon 9 was found in this study and
mutations were not found in exon 13 of the KIT gene.
Among 146 patients, 12 received imatinib palliative
therapy and 11 patients (91.7%) were evaluable for clinical
response. Two of 3 patients (66.7%) with KIT mutations
identified by NGS achieved partial response (PR), while
only 1 of 8 patients (12.5%) without KIT mutations
reached PR, suggesting NGS could identify a portion of
patients eligible for imatinib therapy.
In addition to hot spots, other exons of the KIT or
PDGFRA genes were confirmed to carry missense or

Quality control of next-generation sequencing
Average coverage of next-generation sequencing was
> 200× and sequence content of four bases T, C, A, G was
well called and balanced. The actual GC distribution over
all sequences was similar with theoretical distributions.
Furthermore, the proportion of N appearing in a sequence
was low and the distribution of fragment sizes was uniform
(chiefly 100 bp; range: 99–101 bp). This guaranteed
accuracy of sequencing and established a foundation for data
elucidation (Supplementary Figure S2).

of KIT mutations have been reported previously, and

sequenced whole exomes of 48 genes containing KIT/
PDGFRA with targeted NGS in a sample of KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GISTs.
For hot spots in the KIT and PDGFRA genes, 19
KIT mutations and 4 PDGFRA mutations were identified
in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type cases according NGS. These
mutations were mutually exclusive and most mutations
(n = 20) were point mutations. Mutations in exons 9 and
13 of the KIT gene were not identified. NGS may not
be suitable for identifying deletion mutations in large
fragments located in exon 11 of the KIT gene. Xu and
colleagues reported that KIT and PDGFRA mutations in
121 samples by NGS were 49.6% and 0.8%, respectively
[14], significantly fewer mutations than previously
reported [7, 13]. However, Gleeson FC and colleagues
reported that targeted NGS of cytology samples from 19
patients with GISTs is clinically feasible [15]. Our data
show that NGS did not identify deletion mutations in exon
11 of the KIT gene in several samples. Thus, NGS should
be optimized for clinical practice for assessing GISTs.
The five most frequently mutated genes were TP53,
ROS1, NF1, ATRX, and KIT, but whether these mutation
genes participate in tumorigenesis of GISTs warrants more
study. Hechtman’s group analyzed 8 patients with wild-type
KIT/PDGFRA, and 8 cases had loss of SDHB expression
and carried ARIDIA, TP53, and other gene alterations
[16]. Pantaleo and colleagues reported that SDH mutations
were frequently observed in patients with KIT/PDGFRA

KRAS and BRAF mutations in KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GISTs
Important downstream molecules of KIT/PDGFRA,
KRAS and BRAF mutations have been reported in different
studies. For common mutations of KRAS (exon  2) and
BRAF (exon 15), one patient carried a G13D mutation
in exon 2 of the KRAS gene, and six carried mutations
(5 carried V600E mutations and one carried the A598D
mutation) in exon 15 of the BRAF gene in this study, and
this excluded hot spots of KIT/PDGFRA genes. Various
mutations were also observed in other exons of KRAS and
BRAF genes, which could co-exist with each other and
with common mutations (Supplementary Table  S2).

DISCUSSION
Oncogenic mutations of KIT/PDGFRA genes
are the major mechanisms of tumorigenesis of GISTs,
and KIT/PDGFRA genotypes are correlated to imatinib
efficacy [3]. At present, patients with KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GISTs are usually not treated with imatinib but
30% of these patients may benefit from imatinib, likely
due to unidentified susceptibility factors or incomplete
sequencing data with Sanger sequencing. Here, we

wild-type GISTs [5], especially in pediatric patients [4].
Patients with wild-type KIT/PDGFRA had high expression
of IGF pathway family members [17, 18], which offered an
alternative therapeutic strategy for treating KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GISTs. Studies with small samples indicated
that genomic profiles between KIT/PDGFRA wild-type
and mutant GISTs were different [19, 20]. Until now, a
pathogenic mechanism to explain KIT/PDGFRA wild-type
GISTs was not known and comparative analyses of whole
genomic sequencing of large samples of KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type and mutant GISTs should provide insights about
KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs.
Hot spots in KIT/PDGFRA genes were mutually
exclusive and mutations in other exons of the KIT/PDGFRA
gene co-existed with each other and with hot spot mutations.
Mechanisms or reasons for exclusive hot spot mutations
were similar to KRAS/BRAF exclusive mutations in
colorectal cancer [21]. For GISTs, only primary hot spot
mutations in KIT/PDGFRA genes were excluded, however,
primary and secondary mutations were concomitantly
located in hot spots of the KIT/PDGFRA genes [22].
Previous research suggests that KIT mutations
have polyclonal features [2, 23], so FFPE sections of 19
patients identified to carry hot spots mutations of the KIT
gene were macrodissected into four regions followed by
PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Four of the 19
cases had intratumoral KIT mutational heterogeneity with
concurrent wild-type and mutant tumor cells, which may
have triggered polyclonal evolution and metastasis and
unique therapeutic sensitivity.
Downstream pathways of KIT/PDGFRA genes
may be important sources for explaining drug sensitivity.
KRAS and BRAF mutations have been reported but data
were inconsistent [8, 24]. Miranda C and colleagues
reported that KRAS (5%) and BRAF (2%) mutations were

identified in GISTs carrying KIT/PDGFRA mutations,
not in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs [8]. Agaimy A
and colleagues demonstrated BRAF mutations (7%)
were detected in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs not in
mutant GISTs [25]. Our previous results presented that
KRAS (1.7%) and BRAF (1.7%) mutations were detected
in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs not in mutant GISTs
(unpublished data). Whether KRAS/BRAF mutations can
predict imatinib resistance in GISTs requires validation in
a larger sample size.
Nannini and coworkers described KIT/PDGFRA
wild-type GIST as a set of different diseases sustained
by specific molecular alterations not yet known [25].
Although our results were somewhat superficial, we
identified patients eligible for imatinib therapy by NGS.
Intratumoral KIT mutational heterogeneity may be
monitored to evaluate imatinib efficacy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and samples
From October 2001 to January 2014, a total of
1,080 individuals with GISTs were screened for KIT or
PDGFRA mutations at Peking University Cancer Hospital.
We identified 185 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type patients and
among these 39 were excluded due to lack of genomic
DNA data or failure of library preparation for NGS
(Figure 3). All clinicopathological features and treatments
were retrospectively assessed from medical records,
and samples were taken prior to imatinib or sunitinib
treatment. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients for sample study, and the study was approved
by the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University
Cancer Hospital.

and 146 were analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). There was insufficient genomic DNA or the library preparation
failed for 39 patients.

in the 5-bp NQS window around the indel, across indelsupporting reads).
Low frequency variants were identified with Fisher’s
exact test. Post-calling filters are based on read depth,
sequencing quality, mismatches, and overlap with indels.
Variation annotations such as locations (exonic, intronic
and intergenic region) and effects on protein coding
(synonymous, missense, nonsense, frameshift), were
performed with an in-house developed bioinformatics tool
with RefSeq (hg19, from UCSC) and UCSC annotation
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). Variants with
the following conditions could be analyzed: (1) located
within an exonic or splicing region; (2) nonsynonymous;
(3) MAF < 0.05 in the European 1,000 genomes variant
database; (4) reads supporting the variation ≥ 5 ; and (5)
variation frequency > 0.01.

Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-mixed
paraffin-embedded tumor specimens with tumor cells > 50%
based on H & E staining using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and stored at −80°C for future
use after quantification with Nanodrop 2000. Mutational
analysis in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of KIT gene and exons
12, and 18 of PDGFRA gene was performed with PCR
amplification and Sanger sequencing according to published
procedures [7]. Each sample was sequenced at least twice.

Library preparation and targeted NGS
Genomic DNA (3 µg) was used for library
preparation according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(MyGenostics, Beijing, China), and the final library size
of 350–450 bp, containing adapter sequences was used in
the following experiment.
A panel of 48 genes (Supplementary Table S1)
including KIT and PDGFRA genes was captured with
OncoCap Enrichment System (MyGenostics, Beijing,
China) based on previously published methods [26]. After
enrichment, libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
Solexa HiSeq 2000 sequencer for paired reads of 100 bp
followed by data retrieval using Solexa QA package and
a cutadapt program (http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/).

Experimental validation
Macrodissection of tumor sections and subsequent
PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing was used to
validate detected missense mutations by NGS. PCR products
were sequenced with a 3730XL genetic analyzer and
Chromas software was used to analyze sequencing results.

Bioinformatic analysis
Supplementary Figure S1 shows the experimental
design. Briefly, illumina clean reads (the sequencing
quality > 20 and read length > 80 bp) were aligned to each
human reference genome (hg19) using the BWA program
and quality scores were recalibrated and realigned to
references  using GATK software. Duplicated reads
were removed using Sequence Alignment/Map tools
(SAMtools) and only uniquely mapping reads were used
for variation assessment.  Low frequency variants were
identified on the basis of the bam file.  The SAMtools
mpileup command was used to generate pileup files.
VarScan was performed to assess pileup files from
tumor samples to heuristically call for a genotype at
positions achieving certain thresholds of coverage and
quality.
SNVs were detected and genotyped with the
GATK UnifiedGenotyper in single-sample mode, and
variants were filtered with GATK VariantFiltration
module (with filters “QUAL < 50.0 & QD < 5.0 & HRun
> 10 & DP < 4” and parameters –cluster 3 -window 10).
Indels were detected with GATK IndelGenotyperV2 and
filtered with a custom python module that removed sites
with amax_cons_av ≥ 1.9 (maximum average number of
mismatches across reads supporting the indel) or max_
cons_nqs_av_mm ≥ 0.2 (maximum average mismatch rate
