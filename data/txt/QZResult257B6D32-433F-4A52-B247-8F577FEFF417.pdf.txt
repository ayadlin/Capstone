Abstract

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Friend Leukemia Virus Induced erythroleukemia-1 (Fli-1), an ETS transcription factor, was
isolated a quarter century ago through a retrovirus mutagenesis screen. Fli-1 has since been
recognized to play critical roles in normal development and homeostasis. For example, it
transcriptionally regulates genes that drive normal hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis. Indeed, Fli-1
is one of 10 key regulators of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation.
Aberrant expression of Fli-1 also underlies a number of virally induced leukemias, including
Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia and various types of human cancers, and it is the target of
chromosomal translocations in childhood Ewing’s sarcoma. Abnormal expression of Fli-1 is
important in the aetiology of auto-immune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). These studies establish Fli-1 as a strong candidate for drug
development. Despite difficulties in targeting transcription factors, recent studies identified small
molecule inhibitors for Fli-1. Here we review past and ongoing research on Fli-1 with emphasis on
its mechanistic function in autoimmune disease and malignant transformation. The significance of
identifying Fli-1 inhibitors and their clinical applications for treatment of disease and cancer with
deregulated Fli-1 expression are discussed.

Introduction
Fli-1 was first identified in 1990 by Ben-David Y. et al., as a common site for proviral
integration in Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (F-MuLV)-Induced erythroleukemia.1
Induction of Fli-1 expression as a result of proviral integration in the vicinity of this gene
was shown to be responsible for the development of erythroleukemia.2 This locus was also
identified as a preferred proviral integration site in Cas-Br-E-induced leukemias.3 A year
after its discovery, Fli-1 was found to be a target of translocation in a majority (85%) of
Ewing Sarcoma, a paediatric cancer of bones. The EWS-Fli-1 translocation (t[11;22])
generates a fusion protein, EWS-Fli-1, with strong transforming activity.4 The chromosomal
translocation creates a fusion of the 5′ trans-activation domain of EWS with the 3′ Ets
domain of Fli-1. The role of ESW-Fli-1 in Ewing’s sarcoma has been extensively
evaluated.5–8 In addition, Fli-1 overexpression was detected in various types of cancer and
disease. Here we review the effect of Fli-1 on hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis and cancer as
well as certain diseases associated with abnormal expression of this transcription factors
(TF).

Fli-1 is a member of the ETS gene family of TFs.9 This gene family shares a DNA binding
domain, the ETS domain, responsible for sequence-specific DNA recognition on target
promoters. In vertebrates, there are 29 different ETS genes expressed in distinct tissues.
Based on sequence homology of the ETS domain, this gene family is divided into 13 groups:
ETS, ER71, GABP, PEA3, ERG, ERF, ELK, DETS4, ELF, ESE, TEL, YAN and SPI.9 The
ERG group comprises Fli-1 and 3 other genes ERG, ERV and ETV.9

I. Fli-1 in hematopoietic Stem/progenitor maintenance and proliferation

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Recent studies have identified TF networks that control hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal
and differentiation into various mature blood lineages.10 A genome-wide computational
analysis of complex binding patterns identified 10 TFs: SCL/TAL1, LYL1, LMO2, GATA2,
RUNX1, MEIS1, PU.1, ERG, FLI-1 and GFI1B, which are important for hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells maintenance and differentiation.11 Three of these genes (PU.1, ERG
and FLI-1) are ETS members. Among these, ERG is most closely related to FLI-1. While
this study identified protein-protein interactions among SCL, LYL1, LMO2, GATA2,
RUNX1, ERG and FLI-1, direct interaction leading to stable DNA binding was only
observed between four (GATA2, RUNX1, SCL and ERG). Despite these results, Fli-1 and
ERG, which recognize a similar DNA binding motif,12,13 were shown to be required for
hematopoietic stem cell development and megakaryocytic lineage commitment.14–16 Indeed,
using single and double knock-out mice for Fli-1 and Erg, this study demonstrated that
disruption of both ETS genes in the hematopoietic linage significantly reduces the number
of HSC/progenitors and mature megakaryocytes.16 As fli-1 and erg were derived through
gene duplication of an ancestral gene,2 overlapping functions of these genes may reflect the
enormous demand in a living organism to maintain HSC and produce distinct mature blood
cells.

II. Role of Fli-1 in hematopoiesis and development of various blood cell
lineages
a. Erythroid development
Fli-1 is expressed at high levels in various hematopoietic progenitors/mature cells and
endothelial cells, and at lower levels in lung, heart and ovaries.2,17–19 In erythroblasts, Fli-1
expression is downregulated during (Epo)-induced differentiation of erythroblasts to mature
erythroid cells.20 Downregulation of Fli-1 triggers erythroid progenitors to undergo
differentiation and generate erythroid cells. Indeed, exogenous Fli-1 expression in erythroid
progenitors (through transfection or viral infection) blocks differentiation and promotes
uncontrolled cell proliferation.21 Deregulated/overexpressed Fli-1 in erythroid progenitors
alters a cascade of events that switches Epo-induced differentiation to Epo-induced
proliferation by activating Ras signaling.21 Importance of Fli-1 in erythroid differentiation
was further established in vivo using chimeric and knock-out mice models of Fli-1 as
described below.14,22,23

b. T-cell development

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Expression of Fli-1 and several other ETS members is elevated in various stages of T-cell
development.24 In T-cells, the fli-1 promoter is tightly regulated by several members of the
ETS gene family. Its expression is upregulated by Ets1, Ets2, Fli-1 and Elf1 alone or in
combination with GATA factors, but inhibited by Tel.25 The role of Fli-1 in T-cell
development was demonstrated in Fli-1 knock-out mice, in which an N-terminal region was
deleted by gene targeting (designated Fli-1ΔNT). These mutant mice are viable but exhibit
thymic hypo-cellularity. This defect was not associated with a specific subpopulation of
thymocytes or apoptosis, implicating Fli-1 in prethymic T-cell progenitors.19 This initial
Fli-1 mutant mouse strain expressed a truncated Fli-1 protein owing to an internal
translation-initiation site and alternative splicing around the neo cassette used for gene
targeting. Two subsequent Fli-1 null mice succumbed to embryonic lethality at day 11.5–
12.5, precluding analysis of T cell development.23,26 Interestingly, transgenic mice
overexpressing Fli-1 in hematopoietic progenitors exhibit delayed double-negative (DN) to
double-positive (DP) transition in vitro, and inhibition of CD4 differentiation and enhanced
CD8 development both in vitro and in vivo.27 This eventually leads to a pre-T cell
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. Increased NOTCH1 expression was detected in these
Fli-1 transgenic T cells and, accordingly, activating Notch1 mutations were later identified in
all tumors.27
c. B-cell development
Fli-1 Transgenic overexpression of Fli-1 in various mouse tissues, with highest levels in
thymus and spleen, induces high incidence of a progressive immunological renal disease and
ultimately renal failure. The presence of hypergammaglobulinemia, splenomegaly, B-cell
hyperplasia, accumulation of abnormal CD3+/B220+-T lymphoid cells and CD5+/B220+-B
cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues as well as detection of various auto-antibodies in sera of
these transgenic mice, implicate Fli-1 in B-cell proliferation and survival.28 A role of Fli-1
in B-cells was also observed in a recently generated Fli-1 knock-out mice engineered to lack

the CTA domain (Fli-1ΔCTA), resulting in expression of mutant mRNA and protein.29,30
Fli-1ΔCTA homozygous mice are viable but exhibit partial perinatal lethality with reduced
platelet numbers. These mutant mice have significantly fewer splenic follicular B cells and
more transitional and marginal zone B cells relative to wild-type mice.30 Expression of
genes implicated in B cell development including Igα, Pax-5, E2A and Egr-1 is reduced,
while Id1 and Id2 expression increases.30 In addition, naive B-cells from Fli-1ΔCTA mice
show reduced responsiveness to mitogens.31
d. Megakaryocyte development

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Fli-1 is expressed at high levels in megakaryocytic progenitors and further induced during
differentiation.32 A dominant phenotype of Fli-1ΔCTA mice is a significant reduction in the
number of mature megakaryocytes and thrombocytopenia.29 As noted, a complete knock-out
of Fli-1 results in embryonic lethality. This is associated with loss of vascular integrity
leading to bleeding within the vascular plexus of the cerebral meninges and specific
downregulation of Tek/Tie-2, the receptor for angiopoietin-1.26 These mice also exhibit a
defect in megakaryopoiesis, a phenotype similar to Jacobsen or Paris-Trousseau syndrome, a
relatively rare congenital disorder in which fli-1 is commonly deleted. Clinical abnormalities
of this disease include growth and mental retardation, cardiac defects, dysmorphogenesis of
the digits and face, pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia.33–35 Fli-1 in collaboration with
GATA-1 was shown to regulate expression of several megakaryocytic specific genes
including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, HOxa10 and Rab27B, further
highlighting the importance of Fli-1 in megakaryopoiesis.29,36 Further evidence for a role of
Fli-1 in megakaryopoiesis has recently been demonstrated using conditional knockout
mice.14
A clinical relevance of Fli-1 in megakaryopoiesis was uncovered by Stockley et al., who
detected mutations in Fli-1 and Runx1 in 6 families with excessive bleeding and defects in
platelet development. The discovery of inactivating mutation in these TFs affecting
megakaryocytopoeisis suggests a common genetic aetiology for defective platelet dense
granule secretion and mild thrombocytopenia.37
e. Development of other blood cells

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In addition to megakaryocytes, Fli-1 is involved in development of other myeloid derived
cells. Fli-1ΔCTA mice exhibit significant reduction in the number of mature monocytes,
marcrophages and dendritic cells.38 In addition, analysis of Fli-1−/−:+/+ chimeric mice,
generated through morula-stage aggregation, revealed reduced neutrophillic granulocytes
and monocytes as well as increased number of natural killer (NK) cells.22

III. The role of Fli-1 in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis
1. Vasculogenesis
Vascular endothelial cells (EC) form the luminal layer of blood vessels. A role of ETS genes
in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis was initially suggested from studies in Xenopus laevis.
Transgenic overexpression of Xenopous Fli-1 (Xi-fli-1) during early embryogenesis led to
anomalies in head and heart development and delayed erythroid differentiation.39,40

Li et al.

Analysis of fli-1 mutant Zebrafish also revealed defects in the circulating system, indicating
early evolutionary role for this TF in development of blood and vascular systems.41 Based
on these observations, Lawson et al., generated transgenic zebrafish in which enhanced
green florescence protein (eGFP) is placed under control of the fli-1 promoter. The fli-1/egfp
transgenic zebrafish expressed eGFP in all blood vessels throughout embryogenesis,
providing a unique model system to continuously monitor Fli-1 expression during vertebrate
embryonic vasculature development in vivo.42

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In a related study, Pham et al., discovered high expression of fli-1 and three other ets genes,
erg, ets1 and etsrp, in the zebrafish vascular system.43 To uncover their roles in
vasculogenesis, these genes were knocked out individually or in combination. Individual
fli-1, erg, ets or etsrp knock-out mice showed partial inhibition of endothelial differentiation,
whereas loss of all 4 genes blocked endothelial differentiation43, hence revealing extensive
redundancy among these ets genes in endothelial cells. In another direction, genome-wide
analysis of ETS genes in zebrafish revealed that erg, fli-1 and etsrp act cooperatively and are
required for angiogenesis, possibly through direct regulation of the endothelial cell junction
protein VE-cadherin.44 Xenopus and zebrafish embryos lacking fli-1 exhibit a blockade in
hemangioblast development. In addition, Fli-1 induces expression of key hemangioblast
genes including Scl/Tal1, Lmo2, Gata2, Etsrp and Flk1.45 These intriguing findings establish
Fli-1 at the apex of a transcriptional network that regulates blood and endothelial
development.
In a recent and related study, Li et al., demonstrated that Angiogenic factor with G patch and
FHA domains 1 (Aggf1) acts upstream of Fli-1 in zebrafish. Knockdown of Aggf1 in
Zebrafish resulted in a dramatic reduction in expression of the hemangioblast markers Fli-1,
Etsrp, lmo2 and Scl, This result indicates that aggf1 is involved in differentiation of both
hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, and that aggf1 acts upstream of fli-1 to specify
hemangioblasts.46 Overall, these results corroborate previous observations on the presence
of DNA-binding recognition sites for Fli-1 and other ETS factors on promoters of master
developmental regulators of blood and endothelial cells.41,43,47–50

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In mouse and human, ECs express high levels of Fli-1 and several other ETS genes
including ERG, ETS1 and ELF-1.51 In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC),
expression of these ets genes is significantly induced after stimulation with Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).51 While Fli-1 overexpression in xenopus showed an
endothelial-specific phenotype, such effect was not observed in Fli-1 transgenic mice. These
mice however developed a B-cell phenotype associated with severe renal and auto-immune
disease.28 The absence of a xenopus-like EC effect in these mice may be due to promoter
selective activity, resulting in insufficient expression of Fli-1. As noted, Fli-1 null mice die at
gestation day 11.5–12.5 due to massive cerebral hemorrhage and loss of vessel integrity.23,26
Whether this cerebral hemorrhage is the result of EC dysfunction remains to be determined.
The ETS genes ETV2, FLI-1 and ERG1 specify the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells
into induced vascular endothelial cells (iVECs).44,52,53 EC specification by these ETS
proteins requires cooperation with other TFs including SCL/TAL1, GATA2 and LMO2.52
These iVECs are unstable and drift toward nonvascular cell fate. In a recent study, human

midgestation c-Kit(−) lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) were successfully
reprogrammed into vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs) without transitioning through a
pluripotent state. Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generated immature rAC-VECs,
whereas co-expression with FLI-1/ERG1 endowed rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and
morphology that matched mature ECs. Brief inhibition by transforming growth factorβ
(TGFβ) functionalized VEGFR2 signaling, and increased specification of ACs into rACVECs.54 These results demonstrate that short-term ETV2 expression and TGFβ inhibition
with constitutive ERG1/FLI-1 co-expression reprogram mature ACs into durable rAC-VECs
that may be used to treat diverse vascular diseases.
2. Angiogenesis

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

During angiogenesis, new blood vessels arise from existing ones by budding out of
endothelial cell capillaries. Fli-1 regulates this process by controlling expression of key
angiogenic genes. For example, expression of Fli-1 as well as ERG and ELF-1 in ECs
activates Endoglin during angiogenesis.47 Endoglin is upregulated in ECs to control cellular
response to TGFβ. Fli-1/ERG in cooperation with GATA2 also regulates VE-Statin/egf17,55
which is expressed in embryonic and adult ECs and controls the recruitment and
proliferation of smooth muscle cells and pericytes, two key events in the stabilization of
newly formed capillaries during angiogenesis.56 In ECs, Fli-1 is directly regulated by ETS-1
implicating both ETS genes in endothelial cell fate.57

IV. Role of Fli-1 in immunity and auto-immune diseases
A. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

As mentioned above, high levels of Fli-1 expression is detected in B-cells, pre- and resting
T-cells as well as in several other types of immune cells.24,27,30,58,59 Initial observations
implicating Fli-1 in immunity and immune disorders came from analysis of transgenic mice
overexpressing Fli-1. Transgenic expression of Fli-1 via the h2k promoter induced B-cell
proliferation and auto-immunity with similar clinical symptoms observed in patients with
SLE.28 This SLE-like phenotype was associated with an increased antibody production,
proteinuria, renal pathology and mortality. In accordance, breeding of heterozygous mice
carrying a Fli-1 null mutation into lupus MRL/lpr mice led to significantly reduced
autoimmune disease.60 Likewise, breeding Fli-1+/− heterozygous mice with NZM2410 mice,
another lupus murine model, also significantly increased survival, which was associated with
reduced levels of auto-antibodies including anti-dsDNA and anti-glomerular basement
antigen.61 The Fli-1+/−:NZM2410 mice also exhibited a reduced development of kidney
disease (glomerulonephritis) associated with decreased monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1
(MCP-1) expression in endothelial cells in the kidney.62 In a related study, transplantation of
bone marrow (BM) cells from Fli-1+/−:MRL/lpr mice into MRL/lpr recipients reduced the
symptoms of autoimmunity such as auto-antibodies, proteinuria and renal disease and
prolonged survival compared to control mice.63 These results demonstrate that Fli-1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells underlies autoimmunity in lupus.
Consistent with these mouse studies, Fli-1 is expressed in peripheral blood mononucleated
cells (PBMCs) and its over-expression correlates with severity of disease in Lupus

patients.58 Interestingly, a polymorphic microsatellite consisting of GA repeats is shorter in
MRL/lpr B and NZM2410 mice than in parental mice. Promoter analysis revealed that
activity of the mouse fli-1 promoter inversely correlates with length of the GA repeats
(Figure 2A).64 In addition, clinical data and genomic DNA analysis of SLE patients revealed
that the human microsatellite exhibits a similar inverse correlation between GA repeats and
promoter activity. The specific polymorphic microsatellite in the human fli-1 promoter was
significantly more prevalent in SLE patients without nephritis and tended to be more
prevalent in SLE patients with serenities.65 Together, these data suggest that a shorter
microsatellite repeat in the fli-1 promoter may increase gene expression and contribute to the
pathogenesis of lupus and other disease. Interestingly, Fli-1 has also been identified as the
leishmania major susceptibility locus lmr2.66 In contrast to lupus with a longer GAn repeat
deletion, a shorter GAn repeat in the fli-1 promoter was found in the resistant strain
(C57Bl/6) versus susceptible strain (BALB/c) (Figure 2B). This one GA repeat deletion
results in a lower Fli-1 expression and may be a major contributor to cutaneous
leishmaniasis.

b. Systemic Sclerosis or Scleroderma (SSc)
SSc is a complex autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by vasculopathy,
activation of the immune system and wide-spread organ fibrosis.67 Although the onset of
fibrosis in SSc typically correlates with production of auto-antibodies, whether the latter
contributes to disease pathogenesis or simply serves as a marker of disease remains
controversial. Moreover, the mechanism for auto-antibodies induction is largely unknown. A
recent study suggests that epigenetic downregulation of Fli-1 in fibroblasts of SSC patients
plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of disease.68 In accordance, targeted disruption of
Fli-1 in fibroblasts or endothelial cells reproduced the histopathologic features of fibrosis
and vasculopathy seen in SSc, respectively.69,70 Since Fli-1 regulates genes involved in
vessel maturation and stabilization, reduced levels of Fli-1 in SSc vasculature could trigger
unstable development of vessels that are prone to regression, as observed in the human
disease.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Interestingly, Fli-1 is phosphorylated on threonine 312 at high levels in SSc fibroblasts, and
this correlates with induction of PKCδ nuclear localization by TGF-β and its downstream
effector c-Abl, suggesting that a c-Abl/PKCδ/phospho-Fli-1 pathway is constitutively
activated in these cells.71 Phosphorylation of Fli-1 facilitates its binding to the p300/CREBbinding protein-associated factor (PCAF), resulting in acetylation of lysine 312 (Fig.
3).71–73 Fli-1 acetylation in human fibroblasts decreases its stability and DNA binding,
leading to de-repression of the alpha2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter and higher collagen
production. Thus, as proposed by the authors, blocking the TGFβ/c-Abl/PKCδ/phosphoFli-1 pathway may be an attractive approach for SSc therapy.71,74
The cardiotonic steroid hormone marinobufagenin (MBG), a digitalis-like substance in mam
mals, is implicated in pathogenesis of experimental uremic cardiomyopathy, characterized
by progressive cardiac fibrosis. A negative correlation between Fli-1 level and MBG has
been observed in various cell lines and knock-out models of Fli-1.75–77 Moreover, a causal
relationship between MBG-induced PKCδ modification results in phosphorylation and

decreased nuclear Fli-1 levels, and increased collagen production.75 Interestingly, in contrast
to TGF-β-mediated Fli-1 modification in SSc (Figure 3), MBG mediated PKCδ
phosphorylation resulted in downregulation of Fli-1 in fibroblasts. Since MBG
phosphorylates PKCδ through a signal cascade involving PLC,75 it is possible that this
glycoside initiates Fli-1 modification in a different amino acid position. Future studies may
determine the position of the MBG-mediated Fli-1 phosphoryation that induces its
degradation. Overall, these findings point to the PKCδ/phospho-Fli-1 pathway as a potential
therapeutic target for uremic cardiomyopathy and other conditions associated with excessive
fibrosis.

V. Role of Fli-1 in malignant transformation

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

As noted, Fli-1 was first identified as a proto-oncogene activated by proviral integration in
F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemias and later in Cas-Br-E-induced Non-T/B-cell and 10A1
stem cell like-induced leukemias.1–3,78 The human homologue of Fli-1 was also identified
during this period.4,79,80 Its oncogenic role was functionally demonstrated in studies in
which over-expression of Fli-1 in erythroblasts resulted in inhibition of
differentiation.20,21,81–83 Overexpression of Fli-1 in erythroblasts also resulted in continuous
activation of the Epo-Epo-R signal transduction pathway and uncontrolled
proliferation.20,21,84 However, transgenic mice over-expressing Fli-1 under control of the
h2k promoter developed B-cell proliferation and lupus-like symptom, not
erythroleukemia.28 Lack of leukemia in these mice may be due to incorrect cell-of-origin of
Fli-1 activation via the h2k promoter, to insufficient expression of the transgene or to genetic
background/modifiers that suppress tumorigenesis. Notably, cre-mediated inducible
expression of EWS-Fli-1 fusion protein under control of the ubiquitous promoter rosa26 led
to erythroid/myeloid leukemia in mice.85

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

An important insight into the mechanism by which Fli-1 affects erythroid transformation
was gained through identification of its target genes. Fli-1 acts in different contexts as a
transcriptional activator or suppressor to regulate genes involved in cell proliferation,
survival or differentiation (Figure 1).86–92 Thus, transcriptional downregulation of gata-1
and Retinoblastoma (rb) inhibits erythroid differentiation,20,86 and up-regulation of bcl-2
and mdm2 blocks apoptosis.20,87,88 Direct upregulation of MDM2 by Fli-1 destabilizes the
anti-apoptotic protein p53, which plays a critical role in the initial transformation of
erythroblasts by Friend virus.89 Downregulation of p53 by transcriptional upregulation of
MDM2 through Fli-1 in erythroblasts also accelerates tumor progression by inducing
genomic instability.89 Similarly, inhibition of p53 by the EWS-Fli-1 fusion protein through
direct protein-protein interaction and/or activation of NOTCH signaling accelerates sarcoma
progression despite retention of the p53 gene.90,91 Fli-1 overexpression in erythroblasts also
increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-Kinase and phosphorylation of
Shc/Ras pathway, two critical regulators of cell survival and proliferation.21 At lower Fli-1
expression, Epo-EpoR activation in erythroid cells results in differentiation. This observation
suggests that high and low levels of Fli-1 expression may induce a different phosphorylation
of Epo-EPOR, leading to either erythroid differentiation or proliferation, respectively.21
Moreover, Fli-1 negatively regulates phosphatidyl-inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase
(ship1) gene expression, leading to a higher phosphorylation of AKT/PKB by PI3K and
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 19.

erythroid proliferation.92 While the mechanism responsible for RAS activation has not been
established, this is likely mediated by the Epo-Epo-R signal transduction pathway, which is
constitutively activated during F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia transformation.21 In
addition to the above downstream effectors of EPO-EPOR signaling pathway, Fli-1 also
positively regulates ribosomal gene expression and ribosome biogenesis, which may play
roles in erythroleukemogenesis.93
Importantly, high Fli-1 expression is observed in a subset of human erythroleukemia, mostly
in the absence of genomic amplification.94 In addition, shRNA-mediated knock-down of
Fli-1 in murine and human erythroleukemic cells suppresses cell proliferation, induces
differentiation and accelerates apoptosis associated with decreased expression of its target
genes including gata-1 and Bcl-2.95 A summary of target genes regulated by Fli-1 is shown
in Table I.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In addition to erythroleukemia, deregulated Fli-1 can induce other hematological
malignancies. For examples, retroviral transduction of Fli-1 into murine T-cell progenitors
disrupts normal development and induces pre-T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.27 Transgenic
expression of Fli-1 results in a lupus like disease associated with a significant increase in Bcell proliferation and autoimmunity.28 Abnormal Fli-1 expression is also associated with
progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).96 In this study, both high and low expression
of Fli-1 was associated with AML progression. In support of these observations, a recent
study identified fli-1 gene amplification within a 11q23–25 amplicon in several cases of
AML and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.97 In leukemia, the ETS protein Tel, but not the
translocated protein Tel-AML, binds and inhibits Fli-1 transcriptional activity.98,99 It appears
that Tel-translocation contributes to the de-repression of Fli-1 activity by abrogating the
normally inhibiting function of the untranslocated Tel allele. Since Tel translocation occurs
widely in myeloid/lymphoid tumors, Fli-1 could act as a major driver of various
hematological tumors. Moreover, Fli-1 and its closely related ERG protein facilitate binding
of the fusion protein AML1-ETO to its cognate DNA, thus highlighting the dual importance
of these ETS proteins in leukemias harboring t(8;21) translocation.100

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In addition to hematological malignancies, high Fli-1 expression promotes the development
of divergent types of solid tumors. The best example is the above mentioned EWS-FLI-1
translocation (t[11;22]) in Ewing sarcoma and certain neuroectodermal neoplasms.4,101
Furthermore, while Fli-1 expression is normally limited to very few lineages including
hematopoietic, vascularogenesis and nervous system,24,27,30,47,48,55–59,69–74 its expression is
readily detected by immunostaining in various benign and malignant tumors. Analysis of
4323 tumours revealed that FLI-1 is expressed at high percentage in 46/62 Ewing’s sarcoma/
primitive neuroectodermal tumors (EWS/PNETs), 2/3 olfactory neuroblastomas, 7/102 small
cell carcinomas of the lung, 10/34 Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs), 19/132 non-Hodgkin’s
lymphomas, 9/29 medullar carcinomas of the breast, 2/3 desmoplastic small round cell
tumors (DSRCTs), and 53/74 benign and malignant vascular tumours.102
FLI-1 is highly expressed in several triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231,
MDA-MB436, BT-549 and HCC1395). Moreover, over-expression of FLI-1 in the luminal
breast cancer cell line, MCF7, which expresses a negligible level of this TF, suppressed

apoptosis upon serum depletion. Inhibition of apoptosis was associated with upregulation of
Bcl-2, a direct target of Fli-1.103 Similar to breast cancer, FLI-1 expression is also detected
in several melanoma cell lines and in formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue sections from
97 melanomas including 69 cases of primary and 28 metastatic melanomas by
immunohistochemistry. Higher FLI-1 expression was detected in metastatic than in primary
melanoma tumors, and this was positively correlated with high Ki67 index and ulceration of
the primary tumor.104 Fli-1 has been found fused to the solute carrier family 45 member 3
(SLC45A3) gene in a small subset of prostate cancer.105 Together, these studies demonstrate
high expression as well as translocations involving Fli-1 in a wide range of hematopoietic
and solid tumors. Additional analysis is needed to determine whether these malignancies are
driven by FLI-1 and whether tumors are addicted to continuous expression of this ETS
factor.

VI. Role of Fli-1 in tumor angiogenesis

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Angiogenesis is required for proliferating tumor cells to receive nutrients and metabolites.
Tumor cells regulate angiogenesis through secretion of factors that stimulate neovascularisation. As described above, endothelial cells express high levels of Fli-1.51 This has
prompted the use Fli-1 as a marker for tumor angiogenesis. High Fli-1 expression is also
detected in the majority of benign and malignant vascular tumours.106–108 The EWS-Fli-1
fusion protein directly activates vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), leading to
increased angiogenesis and malignant progression.109 High levels of VEGF were also
detected in the tumor microenvironment of Fli-1 overexpressing erythroleukemias and
shown to play a critical role in tumor initiation.110

VII. Therapeutic aspects of Fli-1

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

As described above, Fli-1 regulates genes and pathways associated with hallmarks of cancer
initiation and progression including sustained proliferation, angiogenesis, genomic
instability, inhibition of apoptosis and differentiation; its abnormal expression or
translocation induces diverse tumor types (Figure 4). In addition, FLI-1 controls the fate of
hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors and is directly involved in several auto-immune
diseases. Some immune cells with over-expressed Fli-1 (unpublished results) have been
found to act as microenvironmental niche to support expansion of leukemic cells in vivo and
in vitro.110 Therefore, Fli-1 represents an attractive therapeutic target. Toward this end,
several inhibitors of DNA- or RNA-binding activity of the EWS-Fli-1 fusion protein were
developed.111–114 The effectiveness of these compounds for the treatment of Ewing’s
sarcoma and other malignancies with a EWS-Fli-1 translocation is yet to be determined in
randomized clinical trials. In a recent study, additional inhibitors of EWS-Fli-1 have been
identified from libraries of small molecules/compounds with known biological activities. In
addition to anti-EWS-Fli-1 activity, these drugs possessed strong anti-Fli-1 activity, resulting
in suppression of proliferation of human and murine erythroleukemia cell lines at low drug
concentrations (nM - low μM range). Some of these Fli-1 inhibitors could suppress
progression of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemias in vivo, in which leukemic cells acquire
activated Fli-1 through retroviral insertional mutagenesis.115 Many of these Fli-1 inhibitors
have known biological activities and are presently used to treat of cancers. Two of these

drugs, etoposide and dactinomycin, are topoisomerase inhibitors used to treat diverged
cancer types including Ewing’s sarcoma.116–118 These chemotherapeutic agents likely kill
tumor cells both by inducing DNA damage and by suppressing Fli-1 expression. About 30%
of anti-Fli-1 compounds were from cardiac glycoside family of drugs (similar to MBG, see
section II.b), which downregulates Fli-1 expression.115 Interestingly, one of the compounds
(Calcimycin), a calcium ionophore, inhibits Fli-1 DNA-binding by inducing a Fli-1
modification that is associated with downregulation of PKCδ, an interesting observation that
warrants further investigation.
A recent study has identified microRNA-145 as a potent inhibitor of both Fli-1 and EWSFli-1 protein expression.119,120 Development of a delivery system to introduce mir-145 into
cancer cells over-expressing this TF may therefore be therapeutic. As described above, Fli-1
plays a critical role in survival and proliferation of angiogenic cells. Thus, Fli-1 inhibitors
may not only inhibit proliferation of Fli-1 over-expressing tumors, but also cut off their
blood supply. Table II lists anti-Fli-1 compounds/molecules identified to date with their
respected mechanism.

We expect that useful Fli-1 inhibitors (or agonists) to be effective only if they specifically
target this TF but not other related ETS members. Thus, the challenge in identifying Fli-1
modulators is compounded by the general difficulty of identifying antagonists for a
transcription factor and the need for specificity. For example, inhibitors that interfere with
Fli-1 binding to DNA elements on promoters may simultaneously inhibit other family
members and therefore may have inadvertent adverse effects. Thus, putative inhibitors
should be analyzed side-by-side with specific shRNA/RNAi for Fli-1 to determine if they
phenocopy the effect of knocking down this TF.

In addition to cancer, Fli-1 inhibitors may also be beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune
diseases such as SLE, which express high levels of FLI-1. Fli-1 also plays a critical role in
maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitors and their differentiation to various mature
blood cells. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated that conditional Fli-1 loss in several
myeloid lineages affects commitment decisions leading to a drastic decrease in mature
megakaryocytes, proliferation arrest and inhibition of terminal erythrocytic differentiation.14
It is therefore possible that syndromes such as red cell anemia and thrombocytopenia can
also be treated with Fli-1 inhibiting compounds. Overall, generation of potent anti-Fli-1
inhibitors with good pharmacokinetic properties may revolutionize treatment of multiple
diseases and cancers overexpressing Fli-1.
While these diseases may benefit from Fli-1 inhibitors, others such as SSc, which are
characterized by low Fli-1 expression, may be ameliorated by treatment with small
molecules capable of increasing/activating endogenous Fli-1. Indeed, a recent study has
identified the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciproflovacin as an antifibrotic compound in SSc.
Ciproflovacin was shown to affect SSc through downregulation of Dnmt1 and upregulation
of Fli-1.121 Thus, both agonists and antagonists of Fli-1 may provide therapeutic benefits for
the treatment of immune-diseases and cancers, respectively.

Summary
In the past two and half decades, data from over 1000 publications establish Fli-1 as a key
regulator of normal development and malignant transformation. These studies reveal an
essential role of Fli-1 in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, hematopoiesis,
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Abnormal expression of Fli-1 was shown to drive various
diseases, hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Thus, Fli-1 is emerging as a new and
exciting therapeutic target. The development of small molecules targeting different aspects
of Fli-1 expression or activity could potentially impact treatment of auto-immune diseases
and cancers driven by abnormal expression of this ETS factor.

mice. Shown is a sequence comparison of fli-1 promoter regions containing the GAn
microsatellite from three mouse strains. The GAn microsatellite sequence, located in the 5′
end of exon 1 and begins at bp -321, is marked. Transcription of the Fli-1 gene negatively
correlates with size of the GAn repeats (adopted from Ref. 64). (B) Effect of the GAn

Figure 3.

A model for SSc induction by Fli-1. In fibroblasts, the phosphorylation of C-Abl by TGF-β
induces nuclear translocation of PKCδ. In the nucleus, PKCδ phosphorylates Fli-1 at
threonine 312, which initiates acetylation of Fli-1 by PCAF/P300/CBP, resulting in
dissociation of Fli-1 from the Col1A2 promoter and transcriptional de-repression. Induction
of collagen expression through Fli-1 phosphorylation/acetylation is proposed as a
mechanism for SSC.
