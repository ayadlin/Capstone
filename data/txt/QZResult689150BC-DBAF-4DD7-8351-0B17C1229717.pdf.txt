Abstract
The unresponsiveness of metastatic melanoma to conventional chemotherapeutic and biological agents is largely due to the
development of resistance to apoptosis. Pyrimethamine
belongs to the group of antifolate drugs, and in addition to
antiprotozoan effects, it exerts a strong proapoptotic activity,
which we recently characterized in human T lymphocytes.
However, no data regarding pyrimethamine anticancer activity are available thus far. To this end, we examined the in vitro
effects of pyrimethamine on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution,
and cell proliferation of human metastatic melanoma cell
lines. The in vivo antitumor potential of pyrimethamine was
evaluated in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mouse xenotransplantation model. Our data indicate that
pyrimethamine, when used at a clinically relevant concentration, induced apoptosis in metastatic melanoma cells via
the activation of the cathepsin B and the caspase cascade
(i.e., caspase-8 and caspase-9) and subsequent mitochondrial
depolarization. This occurred independently from CD95/Fas
engagement. Moreover, pyrimethamine induced a marked
inhibition of cell growth and an S-phase cell cycle arrest.
Results obtained in SCID mice, injected s.c. with metastatic
melanoma cells and treated with pyrimethamine, indicated a
significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth. In conclusion,
our results suggest that pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis
may be considered as a multifaceted process, in which
different inducers or regulators of apoptosis are simultaneously implicated, thus permitting death defects of melanoma cells to be bypassed or overcome. On these bases, we
hypothesize that pyrimethamine could represent an interesting candidate for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Introduction
The incidence and mortality rate of malignant melanoma is
continuously increasing worldwide (1). Metastatic melanoma has a
poor prognosis, as it is largely resistant to conventional
chemotherapeutic and biological agents (2). In monochemotherapy
regimens, dacarbazine is still considered the standard first-line

treatment, although it rarely leads to complete remission (5–10% of
patients; ref. 3). Several other chemotherapeutic agents ( fotemustine, vindesine, and temozolomide) have a similar activity to
dacarbazine, but none of these drugs has been shown to
significantly increase the overall survival of melanoma patients.
Combined treatment schedules (polychemotherapy, combinations
of cytostatic drugs and cytokines) are able to increase response
rates up to 20% to 40% (3, 4). However, none of these combined
treatment regimens has been shown to significantly prolong
survival in randomized studies.
Despite a range of different biochemical targets, available agents
generally kill cancer cells by induction of apoptosis. Melanoma cells
have low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in vivo compared with
other tumor cell types and are relatively resistant to drug-induced
apoptosis in vitro (5, 6).
Traditionally, two main cell death pathways have been
recognized: the mitochondrial and the death receptor pathways,
which involve caspase-9, caspase-2, and caspase-8, caspase-10,
respectively (7). However, both pathways converge toward specific
mitochondrial changes. In particular, alterations of mitochondrial
membrane potential (Dw) are associated with the release of
apoptogenic factors, e.g., the release of cytochrome c, the
apoptosome formation, and, finally, the chromatin clumping and
DNA fragmentation. In addition to caspase-mediated proteolysis,
other proteases, such as cathepsins, may also be involved in the
regulation of apoptosis (8). Cathepsins are released from their
physiologic compartment, i.e., the lysosome, and trigger apoptotic
cell death via various pathways, including the activation of
caspases or the release of proapoptotic factors from the
mitochondria. Cathepsin-mediated cell death has been associated
with metastatic melanoma since 1986 (9), and we recently showed
that this enzymatic cascade was capable of apoptotic induction in
cisplatin-treated melanoma cell lines (10).
Pyrimethamine (2,4-diamino-5-p-chlorophenyl-6-ethyl-pyrimidine) belongs to the group of antifolate drugs blocking the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase, which is essential for the synthesis of folic
acid, a cofactor required for DNA synthesis. It is used in the
treatment of infections caused by protozoan parasites, such as
Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum (11). In addition to
its antiprotozoal effects, pyrimethamine may exert immunomodulating activities, including the induction of peripheral blood
lymphocyte apoptosis (12–15). We showed that this drug induces
apoptosis of activated lymphocytes via a mechanism that brings
into play the upstream caspases (16). However, although the
primary target of pyrimethamine is represented by the caspase-8–
driven cascade, this drug also acts on mitochondria. In fact, similar
to other antifolate compounds, pyrimethamine leads to mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which is a late event in the

mitochondrially driven apoptotic cascade (17). It is interesting to
consider that the expression of Bcl-2 (a regulator of mitochondrial
proapoptotic activity) is down-regulated by pyrimethamine in
peripheral blood lymphocytes.
No data on anticancer potential of pyrimethamine are presently
available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro
and in vivo antitumor activity of pyrimethamine in human
metastatic melanoma cells. To this end, we examined the in vitro
effects of pyrimethamine on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis of human metastatic melanoma cells. The
in vivo antitumor potential of pyrimethamine was also evaluated in
a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-mouse xenotransplantation model.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
Human metastatic melanoma cell lines 8863 and 501 have been
previously described (10, 18). These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Life Technologies, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Euroclone), 2 mmol/L glutamine (Sigma), and 50 Ag/mL
gentamicin (Sigma). Tumor cells were tested as Mycoplasma -free
(Mycoplasma detection kit; Roche).

Culture Conditions and Analysis of Cell Viability
Pyrimethamine (Sigma) and temozolomide (Sigma) were dissolved in
DMSO and diluted in RPMI 1640 immediately before experiments.
Melanoma cells were exposed for 24, 48, and 72 h to (a) pyrimethamine
(0.32, 32, and 320 Amol/L) and (b) temozolomide (100 Amol/L). To activate
the CD95/Fas pathway, an antihuman Fas IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb)
was added to melanoma cells (clone CH11, 500 ng/mL; Upstate
Biotechnology). Pirimethamine treatment was also performed in cells
pretreated with (a) neutralizing antihuman Fas IgG1 (clone ZB4, 10 Ag/mL;
Upstate Biotechnology), (b) cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074-Me, 10 Amol/L;
Calbiochem), and (c) pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (50 Amol/L; R&D
Systems). Time-dependent inhibition of cell growth and survival was
determined using trypan blue exclusion method.

Analytic Cytology Analyses
Surface phenotyping and Bcl-2 expression. Surface phenotyping and
Bcl-2 expression analyses were performed by flow cytometry, as described
before (16). The following mAbs were used: anti-CD95 conjugated to FITC
(BD Immunocytometry Systems) and anti–Bcl-2-FITC (DAKO).
Evaluation of apoptosis. Quantitative evaluation of apoptosis was
performed by a double staining flow cytometry method using FITCconjugated Annexin V (AV)/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit
(Marine Biological Laboratory) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reported data are referred to both early (AV+/PI cells, still alive) and late
(AV+/PI+ cells, dead cells) apoptotic melanoma cells.
Mitochondrial membrane potential (#W). DW was studied by
using the lipophilic cationic probe 5-5¶,6-6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes), as previously
described (19).
Measurement of cathepsin B. The expression and the activation state
of cathepsin B was evaluated by both flow cytometry and Western blot, as
previously described (10). For details, see Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Caspase activity. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were assayed by
using the CaspGLOW fluorescein active caspase staining kit (MBL),
following the manufacturer’s instruction, as previously described (16).
Western blot was also performed as described before (10). For details, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell cycle analysis. Cultured cells were treated with 1 mmol/L
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; BD Immunocytometry Systems) for 30 min,
removed from culture, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. 1  106 fixed cells
were incubated in 3N HCl for 20 min. After washing with 0.1 mol/L

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5) to stop acid denaturation, cells were washed twice with
1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 and labeled with an antiBrdUrd FITC-conjugated mAb (BD Immunocytometry Systems) for 30 min
at 4jC. Cells were then stained with 40 Ag/mL PI (Sigma) in the presence
of 10 Amol/L RNase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 jC followed by analysis on a
flow cytometer.
Static cytometry analysis. To visualize intracellular distribution of
cathepsin B and filamentous actin (F-actin), static cytometry analysis was
performed as previously described (10). For details, see Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
ELISA. To evaluate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, the total
cell suspension was centrifuged and washed in ice-cold PBS and the
cytosolic fraction was separated by means of the cytochrome c releasing
apoptosis assay kit (Biovision), as previously described (20). Protein content
was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The amount of cytosolic
cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction was quantified by using a
commercially available ELISA kit following the instructions from the
manufacturer (R&D Systems).

Animals
CB.17 SCID/SCID female mice (Harlan Italy) were used at 4 to 5 wk of
age and were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. SCID mice were
housed in filter top cages and were provided with sterile water and food
ad libitum. All manipulations were carried out aseptically inside a laminar
flow hood. Before injection of the melanoma cells, mice were weighed and
grouped (adjusted to a mean body weight of 20 g, range 18.5–21.0 g) into
two treatment groups and two control groups (eight mice per group). The
cell system used was represented by the human melanoma cell line 501,
derived from a metastatic tumor lesion (18), cultured as reported above. For
injection, Mycoplasma-free melanoma cells were harvested by trypsinization, tested for viability (>95%), and adjusted to a concentration of 1  107
viable cells per 1 mL medium. Mice were injected s.c. into the right flank
with 2  106 501 cells per mouse. Suspensions of pyrimethamine were
prepared daily in citrate buffer of 200 mmol/L 0.5% methylcellulose.
At the onset of tumor (i.e., 7 d from melanoma cell injection), mice were
given by oral gavage with the same volume (400 AL) of vehicle or
pyrimethamine at different doses (3, 6, 30, and 60 mg/kg) 5 d a week up to
42 d from injection (30 d of pyrimethamine treatment). An untreated
control group was also included. All mice were inspected daily, and the
overall clinical condition was assessed. Tumor growth was monitored by
measuring maximal and minimal diameters by caliper, and tumor weight
was estimated with the formula: tumor weight (mg) = [length (mm) 
width2 (mm)] / 2, as previously described (18, 21). Procedures and facilities
followed the requirements of Commission Directive 86/609/EEC concerning
the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific
purposes. Italian legislation is defined in D.L. no. 116 of January 27, 1992.

Immunohistochemistry
After 42 d of tumor growth, mice were sacrificed and the primary
melanoma was removed by excision and fixed in 10% buffered formalin
before being embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded tissues were serially
sectioned, dried at 80jC for 60 min, and deparaffinized according to routine
procedures. Sections were then incubated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and
microwaved for 15 min.
Morphometric analysis. For cell proliferation analysis, tissue sections
were incubated with mouse anti-human Ki-67 antibody (clone MIB-1;
DAKO) followed by the application of a biotinylated secondary antibody.
Apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling staining (TUNEL) by using the DeadEnd
kit (Promega). The slides were observed with a Nikon Optiphot microscope
(Nikon). Both proliferating and apoptotic cells were quantified by analyzing
20 different microscope fields at the same magnification (200).

Data Analysis and Statistics
Flow cytometric analyses were performed by a using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems) using the Cell Quest Pro
software. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test using
Statview program for Windows.

Antitumor Activity of Pyrimethamine

Results
Pyrimethamine induces apoptosis of human metastatic
melanoma cells. We first evaluated the apoptosis-inducing
potential of pyrimethamine by treating two metastatic melanoma
cell lines (8863 and 501) with different pyrimethamine concentrations for 48 h (Fig. 1A, left and right for 8863 and 501 cells,
respectively). In both cell lines, the proapoptotic effect of
pyrimethamine was already remarkable (2.1-fold and 3-fold
increase for 8863 and 501 cell lines, respectively) at a concentration
of 32 Amol/L corresponding to that detected at the steady-state
in vivo (22). A 10-fold increase of pyrimethamine concentration did
not result in higher apoptosis levels in the 8863 cell line, whereas it
further increased cell death in the 501 cell line, reaching values
close to 70% to 80%. For all tested concentrations, the percentage
of AV cells and PI+ cells was V5%. Control experiments carried out
with DMSO alone did not display any proapoptotic activity (<10%).
On this basis, we selected the dose of 32 Amol/L as optimal

pyrimethamine concentration for further studies on melanoma
cells. To better evaluate pyrimethamine-induced cell death, a timedependent analysis of apoptosis was also carried out. We cultured
melanoma cells in the presence of pyrimethamine at different time
points (24, 48, and 72 h). A significant increase of pyrimethamineinduced apoptosis was already detected at 24 h, reaching a plateau
value at 72 h in both 8863 (Fig. 1B, left) and 501 (Fig. 1B, right) cell
lines. Also in this case, the percentage of AV /PI+ cells was V5% at
all time points analyzed. We focused our attention on the 48 h of
pyrimethamine treatment. As a control, to better evaluate the
therapeutic potential of pyrimethamine, we also assessed the
apoptotic susceptibility of our melanoma cells to a typical
anticancer drug. To this aim, we treated melanoma cells with
temozolomide, a promising chemotherapeutic agent for malignant
melanoma (23). We found that both melanoma cell lines analyzed
here were resistant to this drug, i.e., no significant apoptosis was
detected by using temozolomide at a clinically relevant concentration (100 Amol/L; ref. 24), at all time points studied (Supplementary

Fig. S1). As an active role of the CD95/CD95FasL system in apoptosis
induced by antifolate drugs, e.g., methotrexate, was previously
shown (25), we also evaluated the expression of CD95/Fas molecule
at the cell surface of 8863 and 501 cell lines. A different surface
expression of CD95/Fas molecule characterized the two metastatic
melanoma cells. In fact, whereas the 8863 cell line showed a weak
surface expression of CD95/Fas (0.6 F 0.3%; median fluorescence
intensity, 17 F 5), the 501 cell line revealed a high expression of
CD95/Fas (91 F 10%; median fluorescence intensity, 17 F 4).
However, both cell lines were resistant to CD95/Fas-induced
apoptosis in vitro when stimulated with an antihuman Fas IgM
monoclonal antibody (clone CH11). In the presence of pyrimethamine, neither the percentage nor the median fluorescence intensity
of CD95/Fas molecule changed compared with untreated cells.
Furthermore, melanoma cells were treated with the ZB4 mAb,
i.e., the CD95 neutralizing antibody, to exclude a direct involvement
of CD95/Fas receptor in pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis. The
percentage of apoptosis in pyrimethamine-treated melanoma
cells remained substantially unchanged in the presence of ZB4
(Supplementary Fig. S2), thus suggesting that the pyrimethamineinduced apoptosis did not involve the CD95/Fas molecule.
In this set of experiments, aimed at evaluating the apoptosisinducing potential of pyrimethamine, the expression of a key
molecule in the inhibition of apoptotic cell death pathway (i.e., the
Bcl-2 molecule) was also assessed. A down-regulation of Bcl-2
expression was detected after treatment with pyrimethamine in
both cell lines. In fact, compared with control cells, Bcl-2
expression decreased 27 F 5% in 8863 and 59 F 8% in 501 cell lines.
Finally, as cytoskeletal molecules are well known to be involved
in some important tumor processes, such as migration and
invasion (26), a morphologic analysis of actin filament network
in pyrimethamine-treated 8863 and 501 cell lines was performed.
As compared with untreated cells, a breakdown of the F-actin
filaments was detected (Fig. 1C, left and right for 8863 and 501 cell
lines, respectively).

Pyrimethamine induces cathepsin B–dependent and caspasedependent apoptosis in melanoma cells. To identify the apoptotic pathway being activated in response to pyrimethamine (i.e.,
caspase and/or cathepsin pathway), 8863 and 501 cell lines were
initially pretreated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
and/or the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074-Me. We evaluated
pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis at 24, 48, and 72 h of culture
(Fig. 2). In the 8863 cell line, Z-VAD-FMK significantly inhibited
pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 2A;
P = 0.0033). In the 501 cell line, a minor protective effect was exerted
by Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 2B) at all times of pyrimethamine treatment.
When the cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074-Me) was used, pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis was significantly abrogated in the 8863 cell
line after 24 h (Fig. 2A; P = 0.0376). This effect persisted, although
at a minor extent, after 48 h (P = 0.0279) and was lost after 72 h of
pyrimethamine addition. Differently, only a partial protection from
pyrimehamine-induced apoptosis was exerted by the cathepsin B
inhibitor in the 501 cell line at each time point studied (Fig. 2B).
Notably, when the two inhibitors (i.e., caspase and cathepsin B inhibitors)
were used in combination, a complete protection was obtained in both
the 8863 and 501 cell lines at all time points.
The possible involvement of upstream caspases (i.e., caspase8 mainly involved in receptor-mediated apoptosis and caspase-9
mainly involved in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis) and/or
cathepsin B was evaluated by both flow cytometric and Western
blot analyses. In the 8863 cell line, flow cytometric data showed
an increased expression of intracellular cathepsin B 24 h after
pyrimethamine addition, which persisted at later time points
(Fig. 3A, right). The activation of caspase-9, but not of caspase-8,
was also detected after 48 and 72 h of pyrimethamine addition (Fig.
3A, middle and left, respectively). Western Blot analysis confirmed
these results, showing an early activation of cathepsin B and a later
activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 3B). Similarly to what was observed in
the 8863 cell line, cathepsin B expression increased in the 501 cell
line, starting from 24 h of pyrimethamine treatment (Fig. 3A, right).

Antitumor Activity of Pyrimethamine

Figure 3. Flow cytometric (A ) and Western blot analyses (B and C ) of cathepsin B and caspase-8 and caspase-9 in pyrimethamine-treated 8863 and 501 cell lines.
A, caspase-8 (left ) and caspase-9 (middle ) activity and cathepsin B (right ) expression were measured by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as the fold increase
in pyrimethamine-treated cells over that of untreated cells. Columns, mean values of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, significance
compared with untreated cells. B and C, caspase-8, caspase-9, and cathepsin B activity in pyrimethamine-treated 8863 (B ) and 501 (C ) cell lines measured by Western
Blot analysis. Cleaved cathepsin B (31 kDa) and caspase-9 (35 kDa) were detected after 24 and 48 h of pyrimethamine treatment, respectively, in both 8863 and
501 cell lines. In the 501 cell line, but not in the 8863, cleaved caspase-8 (18 kDa) was also observed. Results obtained from a representative experiment are reported.

In this cell line, the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 was
also detected after 48 and 72 h of pyrimethamine addition (Fig. 3A,
middle and left, respectively). Also in this case, Western Blot
analysis confirmed the results obtained by flow cytometry showing
an early involvement of cathepsin B and a later activation of both
caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results
suggest a key role for cathepsin B as an early inducer of
pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis, whereas the contribution of
caspases was detected later in both 501 and 8863 cell lines.
As cathepsin B has been characterized and identified as a native
protein for assessing lysosomal integrity during apoptosis (27), we
also analyzed cathepsin B localization in our melanoma cell lines
before and after pyrimethamine addition. To visualize lysosomes,
cells were loaded with Lysotracker Red, a fluorescent dye that
predominantly loads into lysosomes (see Materials and Methods).
As shown in Fig. 4A, untreated 8863 cells displayed a yellow
punctate pattern resulting from the overlap of green and red
fluorescence and consistent with cathepsin B (green fluorescence)
colocalization to the lysosome vesicular compartment (red
fluorescence), at all time points studied. After pyrimethamine
treatment, cathepsin B exhibited a more diffuse green fluorescent
staining that corresponded to the release of the enzyme from
lysosomes to the cytosol. Similarly, 501 cell line displayed yellow
punctate areas in untreated cells and a diffuse green fluorescence
starting from 24 h of pyrimethamine addition (Fig. 4B).

Pyrimethamine induces mitochondrial modifications. To
further characterize the apoptotic pathway triggered by pyrimethamine in melanoma cells, we also focused on the possible role of
mitochondria, which are well-known regulators of cell death (28).
In particular, previous studies suggested that significant reduction
in Dw and cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the
cytosol are hallmarks of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial
modifications (29, 30). Therefore, time-dependent changes occurring in Dw and the release of cytochrome c were analyzed.
Pyrimethamine induced mitochondrial depolarization at all time
points studied in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3). Parallel
analyses carried out on cytosolic cytochrome c clearly indicated
a significant release of this apoptogenic factor starting from
24 h of pyrimethamine treatment in both cell lines (Supplementary
Table S1).
Pyrimethamine causes growth inhibition in human metastatic melanoma cell lines. To better define the therapeutic
potential of pyrimethamine in the treatment of melanoma, the
antiproliferative activity of the drug in the two melanoma cell lines
was also evaluated. Cells were incubated with 32 Amol/L
pyrimethamine, and cell growth was evaluated in terms of viable
cell counts after 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. As illustrated in Fig. 5A
and B, pyrimethamine caused a time-dependent growth inhibition
in both cell lines. This effect was already detectable after 24 h of
culture (21% of inhibition in both cell lines) and gradually rose

reaching values of f70% and 80% of cell growth inhibition at
72 h in 8863 and 501 cell lines, respectively.
Pyrimethamine induces S-phase cell cycle arrest of human
metastatic melanoma cell lines. To further investigate the
mechanism underlying cell growth inhibition induced by pyri-

methamine, 8863 and 501 cell lines were exposed to the drug and
then analyzed for cell cycle distribution. Subconfluent cell cultures
were treated with pyrimethamine at the same concentration used
in the above-mentioned apoptosis assays (32 Amol/L) and
harvested after 48 h of culture. In Fig. 5C, representative plots of

Representative results obtained with 8863 (A) and 501 (B ) cell lines are reported. Lysosomes were stained with Lysotracker Red and the cathepsin B with green
fluorescent antibody. A yellow punctate pattern, resulting from the overlay of green and red fluorescence, was consistent with cathepsin B localization to the lysosome
vesicular compartment. Note instead green fluorescence, indicating cathepsin B release from lysosomes, in pyrimethamine-treated cells.

cell lines examined by light microscopy (original magnification, 400) after 48 h pyrimethamine treatment. The data of a representative experiment are shown.
B, cell growth was calculated in terms of viable cell counts after 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. Data are expressed as the percentage of cell growth with respect to controls.
C, cell cycle analysis performed by flow cytometry. Representative quadrant plot graphs from three independent experiments are shown. 8863 (a and b) and 501
(c and d) cells were cultured in medium alone (a and c ) or in the presence (b and d ) of pyrimethamine for 48 h. Numbers indicate the percentage of viable cells in
each phase of the cell cycle. Note that treatment with pyrimethamine induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines. D, for each experimental condition shown in C , the
percentage of cells with fragmented DNA was also evaluated. Apoptotic cells were characterized by a hypodiploid DNA fluorescent pattern (sub-G1 peak).

BrdUrd versus PI are shown (a and b, 8863; c and d, 501). In both
cell lines, pyrimethamine induced an increased percentage of cells
in the S-phase and a corresponding decrease of cells in the G1 and
G2-M phases. At the same time, pyrimethamine induced the
formation of a hypodiploid sub-G1 peak indicative of apoptosis
(Fig. 5D). These data suggest that both these mechanisms (i.e., cell
cycle arrest and cell loss due to apoptosis) could be responsible for
pyrimethamine antiproliferative effects.
Pyrimethamine reduces melanoma growth in an SCID
mouse model. The in vivo efficacy of pyrimethamine was
examined by measuring the reduction of tumor growth in a

human melanoma xenograft SCID mouse model. The cell system
used was represented by the human metastatic melanoma cell
line 501. Pyrimethamine administration started at day 7 post s.c.
injection of melanoma cells. The doses of pyrimethamine used to
treat mice in this study were chosen on the basis of the highest
doses (30 and 60 mg/kg/d) tested in the rat model (31). The doses
of 30 and 60 mg/kg/d correspond to a plasma pyrimethamine
concentration of 160 and 320 Amol/L, respectively (22). Tumor
growth and pyrimethamine treatment had no effect on vitality
and behavioral responses of animals at the pyrimethamine doses
used. No weight loss was observed neither during nor at the end

of the experiment. Vehicle had no effect on tumor growth. A
significant reduction of tumor growth (P < 0.05) was evident with
the dose of 60 mg/kg/d starting from the 22nd day of the
injection and up to the end of the experiment (Fig. 6A). Initial
experiments performed with lower doses of pyrimethamine (i.e.,
3 and 6 mg/kg/d) failed to reveal any effect on tumor growth
(data not shown).
In vivo effects of pyrimethamine on proliferation and
apoptosis. The level of cell proliferation was measured by
determining the expression of Ki-67 antigen (a nuclear antigen
present only in the nuclei of cycling cells) on tissue sections derived
from the tumor grown in SCID mice (excised at day 42 of treatment)
and treated or not with pyrimethamine (60 mg/kg/d). Pyrimethamine significantly reduced the percentage of Ki-67–positive 501
cells (22 F 7%) compared with controls (49 F 12%; P = 0.0002;
Fig. 6B). TUNEL staining was performed to asses apoptotic rate
(Fig. 6C). We found that 52 F 7% of tumor cells were TUNEL positive
in sections from mice treated with pyrimethamine, whereas only
11 F 8% of tumor cells were TUNEL positive in sections from control
animals (P = 0.003). These data suggest that pyrimethamine exerted
both antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities, similar to what
have been observed in in vitro experiments.

Discussion
In the present work, we characterized the in vitro antitumor
activity exerted by pyrimethamine in human metastatic melanoma
cell lines. The in vivo antitumor potential of pyrimethamine was
also evaluated in a SCID-mouse xenotransplantation model.
The agents that are commonly used against melanoma act by
damaging cellular components to such an extent that apoptosis is
induced (32). However, disseminated melanoma is largely resistant
to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The identification of
different defects of the apoptosis program in melanoma cells
suggests that multiple signaling pathways may need to be targeted
for maximum therapeutic effectiveness.
Our data indicate that pyrimethamine induced apoptosis of
melanoma cells via a mechanism, bringing into play both the
caspase and cathepsin cascades. According to what was observed
in activated lymphocytes (16), this effect did not require CD95/Fas
engagement, as shown by experiments performed with a specific
mAb blocking CD95/Fas. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that a ligand-independent aggregation of the death
receptor and a recruitment of death-inducing signaling complex
could occur, as shown with some oxidizing agents or bile acids
(33, 34). Similarly to other antifolate compounds, pyrimethamine

cells) and apoptosis (i.e., TUNEL-positive cells).

Antitumor Activity of Pyrimethamine

induced mitochondrial depolarization, a late event in the
mitochondrial driven apoptosis cascade (17). In this regard, it is
interesting to consider that the expression of Bcl-2, a regulator of
mitochondrial apoptotic activity, was down-regulated by pyrimethamine. Thus, pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis may be considered
as a multifaceted process in which different inducers or regulators
of apoptosis are simultaneously implicated, thus allowing death
defects of melanoma cells to be overcome.
Cathepsin B seems to play a major role in the initiation of
pyrimethamine-induced apoptotic pathway in the metastatic cell
lines analyzed here. Under physiologic conditions, cathepsin B is
localized within the lysosomes and is released into the cytoplasm
upon stimulation or cell damage (8). Its release into the cytoplasm
contributes to apoptosis execution. Different mechanisms that can
contribute to lysosomal permeabilization, probably in a stimulus
type–dependent and cell type–dependent fashion, have been
described (30, 35). According to literature, one mechanism of
pyrimethamine-induced lysosomal permeabilization could be the
generation of reactive oxygen species (36).
The proteins that are cleaved by cathepsin B are not well defined
(8). However, literature data suggest a target effect of cathepsin B
on mitochondrial homeostasis with the activation of a mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic program (37). In fact, it has been shown
that cathepsin B, once released into the cytoplasm, enhances both
the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the subsequent
activation of caspase-9 (37). According to this sequence, our data
show an early release of cytochrome c, after pyrimethamine
addition, followed by the activation of caspase-9, in both
melanoma cell lines.
In the 501 cell line, another target for pyrimethamine could be
the caspase-8–driven cascade. In fact, pyrimethamine was able to
induce upstream caspase activation (caspase-8), bypassing CD95/
Fas engagement, similarly to what we had previously observed in
activated lymphocytes from a patient with a lymphoproliferative
syndrome (16). This is noteworthy considering that the melanoma
cell lines used in this study were shown to defy CD95-mediated
apoptosis in vitro.
Briefly, our results suggest a key role for cathepsin B as an early
inducer of pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis, whereas the contribution of caspases was detected later in both 501 and 8863 cell lines. The
involvement of cathepsin and caspase activation in the pyrimethamine-dependent apoptotic pathway could be responsible for the
slight inhibitory effect on drug-induced apoptosis exerted by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and/or the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me when used alone, especially in the 501 cell line. In fact, the
inhibition of one of the two pathways could boost the other one as was
also suggested by the observation that the combined usage of the two
inhibitors completely abrogated pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis.
This effect could provide therapeutic benefits in melanoma cells by
targeting different resistance mechanisms.

In vivo studies in SCID mice seem to be in line with in vitro
studies. In fact, although monotherapy with pyrimethamine was
only partially capable of impairing tumor growth, a significant effect
of the drug in terms of antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities
was observed. This indicates that further studies with combination
protocols taking into account conventional chemotherapeutic
agents and/or biological therapies (e.g., type I IFNs) are mandatory
to assess the real antitumor potential of pyrimethamine.
Finally, there is increasing agreement that autophagy could
represent a fruitful survival strategy for metastatic cancer cells (38).
In particular, metastatic tumor cells are shown to be able not only
to ‘‘recycle,’’ by autophagic processes, degenerated organelles, or
altered proteins (self cannibalism), but also to engulf and digest
foreign material, including cell debris from necrotic cells, as well
as apoptotic bodies or entire apoptosis-triggered cells (xenocannibalism; refs. 39, 40). This skill represents a formidable survival
option for metastatic cells in adverse conditions, such as those they
encounter in their ‘‘journey’’ toward the target organ to establish a
colony. Hence, in line with the previously suggested activity of
another widely used antifolate compound, i.e., metotrexate (41),
the alterations we found after pyrimethamine treatment, i.e., the
impairment of the lysosomal compartment activity and function
and consequent cathepsin B release, could impair this key survival
function and contribute to cell demise. In brief, pyrimethamine
could damage autophagic processes, thus favoring cell deaths.
In conclusion, given the complex rewiring of cell death and
survival pathways during melanomagenesis, it is unlikely that the
cure for melanoma relies on a single agent. Most likely, effective
treatments might include the combination of conventional
chemotherapeutic and biological therapies aimed at targeting
different resistance mechanisms. In this regard, pyrimethamine
may be considered as an interesting candidate because it triggers
different inducers or regulators of apoptosis, thus permitting death
defects of melanoma cells to be overcome.
