Abstract
The transcription factor NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocates into the nucleus and activates phase II genes encoding
detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins, resulting in the
protection of cells from oxidative insults. However, the involvement of Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress responses in breast
cancer cells is largely unknown. Notably, during our study of the
Nrf2 pathway in breast cancer cells, we observed that the nuclear
matrix protein NRP/B was expressed and colocalized with Nrf2 in
these cells, suggesting that NRP/B is involved in Nrf2-mediated
oxidative stress responses. The expression level of NRP/B was
variable in different breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissues,
and was found to be localized in the nucleus. NRP/B expression
was increased after exposure to the oxidative stress agent,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), particularly in the highly aggressive
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Association of NRP/B with Nrf2
in vitro and in vivo was observed in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells, and this association was up-regulated upon
exposure to H2O2, but not to sodium nitroprusside, SIN-1, and
DETA-NO. NRP/B also enhanced Nrf2-mediated NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 promoter activity. Thus, this study reveals
that NRP/B enhances oxidative stress responses in breast
cancer cells via the Nrf2 pathway, identifying a novel role of
nuclear matrix protein(s) in oxidative stress responses. [Cancer

Introduction
Cellular metabolism is required for the biological functions of
cells and their generated toxic by-products, which are physiologically removed by detoxification or clearance systems. Impairment
of this system results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic-free
radicals and abnormal proteins, which cause oxidative stress–
induced damage to cells, leading to lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, and carbonylation, which then disrupt the function of lipids,
DNA, and proteins. These processes result in pathologic consequences, and subsequently to cancer progression (1–3). Coordinated
induction of cytoprotective genes enables the cells to neutralize
reactive molecules and restore cellular redox homeostasis (4, 5). The
antioxidant response element (ARE) that transcriptionally regulates
phase II genes encoding detoxification enzymes and antioxidant

proteins, such as NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), has an
important role in cytoprotection (4–6).
NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a basic leucine zipper
transcription factor that binds to the ARE promoter sequence,
leading to the coordinated up-regulation of ARE-driven detoxifying
and antioxidant genes (7, 8). In response to oxidative stress
factor(s), the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) releases
Nrf2, resulting in translocation and activation of downstream
targets that boost cellular detoxification processes and antioxidant
potential (7, 9–12). The Nrf2 system plays a critical role in
protecting a variety of tissues from a wide array of toxic insults
(carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, diesel exhaust, inflammation,
calcium disturbance, UV light, and cigarette smoke; ref. 13).
Nuclear matrix proteins are reported to be involved in many
biological processes such as transcription, cell cycle, and primary
transcription processing, and are also linked to intermediate
filaments of the cytoskeleton (14–17). Furthermore, nuclear
matrix proteins have been implicated in malignant transformation (18, 19), such as alterations in DNA ploidy, DNA content,
nuclear shape, and proliferative states (20). The nuclear matrix
protein, termed NRP/B (ENC-1), is expressed abundantly in the
nervous system (21, 22), and its expression has been observed in
various brain cell lines, human brain tumors (23, 24), and hairy
cell leukemia (25). NRP/B and Keap1 are members of the kelchrelated family of actin-binding proteins, possessing sequences
homologous to the Drosophila kelch protein (22, 26–28). The
kelch proteins have two characteristic motifs. The first motif
consists of f115 amino acids termed the BTB domain (Broadcomplex, Tramtrack, Bric-a-brac; refs. 29, 30). The other motif
consists of f50 amino acids repeated in tandem and is termed the
kelch repeats (30). Although Keap1 was shown to be a transcriptional
repressor of Nrf2, NRP/B involvement in oxidative stress responses
remains obscure.
Oxidative stress induces the translocation of Nrf2 into the
nucleus, resulting in activation of phase II detoxifying enzyme
genes and antioxidant proteins. The cytoplasmic-nuclear passage
of Nrf2 occurs through nuclear matrix networks. Surprisingly, while
studying the involvement of Nrf2 in oxidative stress responses in
breast cancer cells, we found that NRP/B was expressed and
colocalized with Nrf2 in these cell lines. These results led us to
assess the possible involvement of NRP/B in oxidative stress
responses. This study reveals for the first time that NRP/B is
involved in oxidative stress responses via the Nrf2 pathway in
breast cancer cells. These findings further suggest a novel avenue of
nuclear matrix protein(s) involvement in Nrf2-mediated oxidative
stress responses in these cancer cells.

3-morpholinosydonime hydrochloride (SIN-1), and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) were obtained from Sigma. Catalase (human erythrocytes) was
purchased from Calbiochem.
Cell cultures. Cell culture conditions were undertaken as recommended
by the American Type Cell Collection. MCF-7 cells were cultured in MEM
medium with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and Earle’s balanced salt solution
adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with
0.01 mg/mL bovine insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MDA-MB-231,
T-47D, and 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, and 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with 0.2 units/mL
bovine insulin and 10% FBS. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium
with 1.5 mmol/L L-glutamine adjusted to contain 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate,
and 10% FBS.
RNA isolation. RNA isolation was done using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). The procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One milliliter of TRIzol reagent was added, followed by
the addition of 0.2 mL of chloroform after 15 min. Samples were vigorously
inverted by hand for 15 s, and centrifuged at 12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC.
The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and 0.5 mL of isopropyl
alcohol was added. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 10 min at
4jC. The pellets were washed once with 75% ethanol, dissolved in RNasefree water, and incubated for 10 min at 60jC. RNA concentration was
measured and stored at 80jC.
Northern blot analysis. In brief, 20 Ag of RNA purified from cells were
loaded and run on 1% gel. The RNA gel was transferred onto Hybond-N+

(Amersham) in 20 SSC overnight. Membranes were cross-linked and
prehybridized in prehybridization solution [5 saline-sodium phosphateEDTA (SSPE), 2% SDS, 5 Denhardt’s reagent, 100 Ag/mL denatured Salmon
testes DNA] at 65jC for 6 h. Purified PCR-generated NRP/B (BTB domain)
served as a probe and was labeled with a-32P using the NEblot kit (New
England Biolabs). The membranes were incubated with hybridization
solution containing the NRP/B-labeled probe at 65jC overnight, and then
washed once in washing solution (0.5 SSPE, 1% SDS) for 20 min, and twice
in washing solution (0.1 SSPE, 1% SDS) for 20 min each. Membranes were
then exposed to X-ray film at 80jC.
DNA transfection. 293T cells and transfected with DNA constructs using
LipofectAMINE. For the MDA-MB-231 cells, transfections were done using a
Nucleofector device (Amaxa) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
cells (1  106) were harvested and resuspended with 100 AL of the provided
Nucleofector solution. The cell suspension was mixed with 1.5 Ag of DNA
constructs and then transferred to a certified cuvette. The cuvette was
inserted into the Nucleofector device and the appropriate program (X-13)
was selected and started. Immediately, the cells were replated and cultured
for 24 h followed by cell extraction.
Immunocytochemistry. Cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cultures were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for
30 min. After three washes, cells were treated with 10% goat serum in PBS
for 2 h and incubated with anti-NRP/B (VD2) and/or anti-Nrf2 antibodies
for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes, cells were incubated
with FITC-conjugated IgG and/or Tris-conjugated IgG antibodies for 1 h.
Cells were then washed, and the slides were mounted and images were taken
using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta). To examine the in vitro
colocalization of NRP/B and Nrf2, pEGFP-Nrf2 and Myc-NRP/B constructs
were transfected into 293T cells. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were
fixed and blocked with 3% skim milk and stained with anti-Myc antibody.
Images were then taken using the confocal microscope described above.
Immunoblot analysis. Cell cultures were washed with PBS and lysed
directly on ice with cold lysis buffer [100 mmol/L KCl, 300 mmol/L sucrose,
10 mmol/L Pipes (pH 6.8), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mmol/L EGTA]. The lysates were transferred
to a new tube followed by solubilization for 1 h at 4jC. Total cell lysates were
clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4jC. The concentration of
the cell extracts was determined using a protein assay. Equal amounts of
proteins were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were incubated with anti-NRP/B
(VD2), anti-Nrf2, or anti-CSK antibodies. After three washes, the blots were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase–IgG antibody.
DNA constructs. The mammalian expression constructs for human
NRP/B were generated by amplifying the human cDNA of NRP/B using the
following primers: hNRPB-F4: 5¶-AAGCTTTCAGTCAGTGTGCATGAG-3¶ and
hNRPB-R5: 5¶-GATATCTTAAGAAGGCAGATGTTTCCAG-3¶. The product was
inserted into the pFLAG-CMV4 vector at the HindIII and EcoRV restriction
sites. The resulting construct was designated as pFlag-NRP/B. We also
generated a construct targeting the expression of NRP/B in the nucleus.
The latter construct was generated by PCR using primers as follows: hNRPBF11 5¶-CGTCGACTCAGTCAGTGTGCATGAG-3¶ and hNRPB-R1 5¶-TGCGGCCGCAGAAGGCAGATGTTTCCAG-3¶. PCR was digested with SalI and NotI,
and ligated into the pCMV/myc/nuc vector (Clontech). The resultant
construct was designated as pMyc-NRP/B. The sequences and the expression
of all constructs were verified. pEGFP-Nrf2 was kindly provided by Dr. Laurie
Zipper (Georgetown University, Washington, DC).
Immunoprecipitation. 293T cells were cotransfected with pFlag-NRP/B,
pMyc-NRP/B, or pEGFP-Nrf2. Following 24 h of transfection, the cultures
were washed twice with PBS and lysed with cold lysis buffer on ice. After
preclearing, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or antiNrf2 antibodies. The precipitates were then blotted and probed with
anti-Flag, anti-Nrf2, or anti-Myc antibodies, accordingly. MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with H2O2. Cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to
immunoprecipitation with VD2 or anti-Nrf2 antibody. The precipitates were
blotted and incubated with VD2 or anti-Nrf2 antibodies.
Glutathione S-transferase pull-down analysis. Cells were lysed and
then rotated for 30 min at 4jC. To remove the nonspecific binding to

Results
Expression of NRP/B in breast cancers. Breast epithelial cells
(MCF-10A) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, and MDAMB-231) were analyzed for NRP/B mRNA and protein expression by
Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. The human colon
cancer cell line (HCT-116), which was reported to express NRP/B (31),
served as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1, NRP/B mRNA
expression was detected in all cell lines. The level of NRP/B expression
level in the HCT-116 cells was higher than that in the MCF-10A,

MCF-7, and T-47D cells. Interestingly, both the transcriptional and
translational levels of NRP/B were abundant in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells. CSK was used as an internal loading control.
Immunohistochemistry showed that NRP/B was localized
specifically in the nucleus of the cells (Fig. 2A), as previously
shown in neuronal cells (22). Because MDA-MB-231 cells
abundantly expressed NRP/B, we selected MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cell line as a model system to further analyze the biological
function of NRP/B in breast cancer cells. To confirm the nuclear
localization of NRP/B, cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction was
done in MDA-MB-231 cells using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction reagents. Cellular extracts were subjected to Western
blot analyses using VD2, anti-Lamin B1 (nuclear marker), and antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; cytoplasmic
marker) antibodies. NRP/B expression was strongly observed in the
nuclear extract (Fig. 2B).
We then examined the localization of Nrf2 in breast cancer cells.
Nrf2 was expressed in the cytoplasm, but more intensively in the
nucleus of the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T-47D cells (Fig. 2C). We
also examined the expression of NRP/B and Nrf2 in human breast
tissues by immunohistochemistry staining. NRP/B expression was
localized in the nucleus and more intensively in the perinucleus
(Fig. 2D). The expression pattern of Nrf2 was observed to be similar
to that of NRP/B in breast cancer tissues (Fig. 2D).
In vitro and in vivo interaction of NRP/B with Nrf2. 293T cells
were transfected with Flag-NRP/B and immunoprecipitation was

done using anti-Nrf2 antibody. The association of Nrf2 with NRP/B
was detected by using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3A). A similar
association of NRP/B with endogenous Nrf2 was observed when
293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged NRP/B (designated as
Myc-NRP/B) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Nrf2 antibody
and probed with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3B). We next did a pulldown assay to determine the association of both molecules. 293T
cells were transfected with pEGFP/Nrf2, and the pull-down assay
was done using recombinant GST-NRP/B protein as a bait. Nrf2
interacted with NRP/B as detected with anti-GFP antibody
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar experiments were carried out
using anti-Nrf2 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1B). MDA-MB-231
cells were also cotransfected with Flag-NRP/B and pEGFP-Nrf2. As
shown in Fig. 3C, a complex consisting of Nrf2 and NRP/B was
detected by the anti-Flag antibody, indicating that NRP/B
interacted with Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 cells.
In vitro cellular sublocalization of NRP/B and Nrf2. 293T
cells were cotransfected with Myc-NRP/B and pEGFP-Nrf2
constructs, and then were stained with anti-Myc antibody and
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). As shown in Fig. 3D (merge),
Myc-NRP/B and EGFP-Nrf2 were colocalized in the nucleus.
Up-regulation of NRP/B expression in response to oxidative
stress agents. For these studies, the effects of NO donors (SNP,
SIN-1, DETA-NO) and H2O2 (9, 32) were tested in breast cancer cells.
To optimize the concentration of SNP, SIN-1, DETA-NO, and H2O2,
MDA-MB-231 cells were placed onto 96-well plates and treated with

and incubated with anti-Myc antibody. Texas

various amounts of these chemicals for 24 h. Cell viability was then
assessed by using the CellTiter Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation
Assay. Chemical concentrations that are considered as optimal
should have no significant effect on cell proliferation and should be
able to induce Nrf2-mediated downstream targets. As shown in
Fig. 4A, treatment of cells with 25 to 100 Amol/L of H2O2 induced a
profound inhibitory effect on cell growth, whereas treatment with
5 to 10 Amol/L of H2O2 had no significant effect on cell proliferation.
In addition, 10 Amol/L of H2O2 effectively induced Nrf2-mediated
target genes. Thus, 10 Amol/L of H2O2 was used as the optimal
concentration for further analysis of NRP/B-mediated effects on
oxidative stress responses. Optimal concentrations of SNP, SIN-1,
and DETA-NO were 2 mmol/L, 20 Amol/L, and 10 Amol/L, respectively (data not shown). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with SNP,
SIN-1, DETA-NO, or H2O2. After 12 h of treatment, total cell lysates
were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-NRP/B (VD2)
antibody. H2O2 treatment induced up to a 3-fold increase in NRP/B
expression, whereas other oxidative agents had no effect on the

expression of NRP/B (Fig. 4B). We also examined the effect of H2O2
on NRP/B transcript levels. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
H2O2 for a time course of 12 h. RNA was then purified and subjected
to RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that NRP/B mRNA
transcripts were up-regulated upon H2O2 treatment over the 12
h time course (Fig. 4C). To further confirm that H2O2 induced NRP/B
expression, we used catalase to abolish the effect of H2O2 on NRP/B.
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of H2O2 or with
10 Amol/L of H2O2 plus catalase (10 Ag/mL). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and B, catalase seems to have a negative effect on
H2O2, and subsequently H2O2 failed to induce NRP/B expression.
Increased association of NRP/B and Nrf2 upon H2O2
treatment. To determine the effect of H2O2 on the association of
Nrf2 and NRP/B, we did a short time course of H2O2 induction in
293T cells transfected with Myc-NRP/B. An increased association
of Myc-NRP/B and endogenous Nrf2 was observed 1 h after
treatment of 10 Amol/L of H2O2 compared with the untreated
control, and this increased association between NRP/B and Nrf2

declined 6 h after treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). To
investigate the effect of H2O2 treatment on the endogenous
association of NRP/B with Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, cells were
exposed to H2O2 and the association of these proteins was
analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, an increased interaction between
NRP/B and Nrf2 was observed in the MDA-MB-231 cells.
Colocalization of NRP/B and Nrf2 upon H2O2 treatment.
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with H2O2 for 12 h, fixed, and
immunostained with anti-Nrf2 and anti-NRP/B (VD2) antibodies.
The Nrf2 and NRP/B expression levels were increased and the
colocalization of Nrf2 and NRP/B became more intense in the
nucleus of these cells after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5B).
H2O2 induces the expression of Nrf2-mediated target genes.
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with H2O2 and total mRNA was
prepared. The expressions of TRX, heme oxygenase (HO-1), NQO1,
catalase, and SOD were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. A
significant increase in TRX and NQO1 expression levels was
observed after H2O2 stimulation (Fig. 6A). However, there were no
significant effects on HO-1, catalase, and SOD expression upon
H2O2 treatment compared with the untreated control. Thus, both
TRX and NQO1 are downstream targets of the NRP/B-Nrf2

interaction, which may confer protection against H2O2-induced
toxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells.
NRP/B enhances the activity of the NQO1 promoter. The
ARE-NQO1 promoter sequence ( 1,016/nqo5) constructed with
the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector was used to evaluate the
effect of NRP/B on NQO1 activity. 293T cells were cotransfected
with the NQO1 promoter and mock (pCMV-Myc), pEGFP-C2, or
Myc-NRP/B. Following 24 h of transfection, total cell lysates were
prepared and luciferase activity was measured. Relative luciferase
activity was f9-fold higher in the 293T cells transfected with MycNRP/B compared with cells receiving the mock or GFP transfections (Fig. 6B). An f2-fold increase in relative luciferase activity
was observed in COS7 cells under similar transfection conditions
(see Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Furthermore, we examined the effect of Nrf2 on NQO1 promoter
activity. 293T cells were transfected with various concentrations of
Nrf2. The Nrf2 treatment increased NQO1 activity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6C). To examine the effect of NRP/B on
Nrf2 regulation of NQO1 activity, 293T cells were transfected with
0.125 Ag of Nrf2 (as a baseline) and with various doses of NRP/B. A
significant increase in relative luciferase activity (up to 5-fold) was

The current study reports the involvement of the nuclear matrix
protein NRP/B in Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress responses in
breast cancer cells. This work shows that the association of NRP/B
with Nrf2 is important in the activation of Nrf2-mediated NQO1
transcription, thereby conferring protection against oxidative
stress–induced damage in breast cancer cells.
Protective or oxidative stress responses to extra and/or
intracellular environmental stresses are important for the physiologic activity of cells. One of the oxidative stress response pathways
is mediated by Nrf2 (33). Although there is growing evidence that
the Nrf2 pathway is involved in cellular defenses in the brain,
retinal epithelia, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, spleen,
and erythrocytes (13), the involvement of Nrf2-mediated defenses
in breast cancer is largely unknown. Here, we show the association
of NRP/B with Nrf2, a requirement for the activation of Nrf2downstream target genes in breast cancer, indicating an important
role of NRP/B in oxidative stress responses via Nrf2.
NRP/B plays important roles in various biological processes such
as central nervous system development (21, 22) and neuronal
outgrowth (21, 23, 34) as well as contributes to brain tumors (23),
hairy cell leukemia (25), and colorectal carcinogenesis (35). In our
study, NRP/B expression was observed in breast cancer cell lines and
tissues (Figs. 1 and 2). Although NRP/B was also detected in breast
epithelial cells such as MCF-10A cells, its expression level was very
low (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting that NRP/B may have important
biological function(s) in breast cancer cells, particularly in MDA-MB231 cells, which are highly aggressive and form metastasis in mice.
In response to oxidative stress–induced damage, Nrf2 is released by
its transcriptional repressor Keap1, whereupon it translocates to the
nucleus and activates downstream target genes. Our studies showed
that to activate Nrf2-mediated target genes, Nrf2 is required to be
associated with NRP/B, and subsequently to have its action magnified,
thereby boosting phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant
proteins such as NQO1. Although Keap1 and NRP/B share the
common feature of binding to Nrf2, their differing functions in the
Nrf2 pathway may be due to varying subcellular localization, where
Keap1 is localized in the cytosol and NRP/B is localized in the nucleus.
Thus, NRP/B may play a crucial role in the nuclear compartment in
response to oxidative stress–induced damage.
Oxidative stress–inducing factors disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2
complex and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus (7, 36). Hence, we
tested whether the nitric oxide (NO) donors (SNP, SIN-1, DETA-NO;
ref. 15) and the oxidizing agent H2O2 (32), which induce cellular
damage, exert any effects on the NRP/B-Nrf2 interaction in breast
cancer cells. H2O2 was the only agent that up-regulated NRP/B
expression and induced the association of NRP/B with Nrf2 (Figs. 4
and 5), suggesting that this NRP/B-Nrf2 complex may be involved
in regulating ARE-driven genes to protect cells from H2O2-induced
cytotoxicity.
NQO1 transcription is activated in response to xenobiotics and
antioxidants (9), and protects breast cancer cell lines from H2O2induced damage (32). Therefore, activation of NQO1 transcription
may protect MDA-MB-231 cells against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity
(Fig. 6A). We observed that Nrf2 induced NQO1 promoter activity

and that this promoter activity was enhanced up to 5-fold when
Nrf2 was cotransfected with NRP/B in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 4A, NRP/B expression level was
increased in response to H2O2 treatment. Hence, NRP/B seems to
be essential for Nrf2-mediated NQO1 expression in response to
H2O2-induced cytotoxicity.
NO is a reactive free radical participating in several types of
redox reactions, which mediate its biological effects or limit its
activity in specific chemical reaction(s). In combination with
superoxide, NO forms a reactive peroxynitrite anion that is able to
nitrate and oxidize protein residues, DNA, and lipids, thereby
affecting cellular homeostasis (37). Although NO affects cellular
homeostasis (37), NO donors SNP, DETA-NO, and SIN-1 (referred to
as peroxynitrite generators; ref. 38) had no effect on NRP/B
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, treatment of
MDA-MB-231 cells with peroxynitrite exerted no effect on NRP/B
expression and NRP/B-Nrf2 association (data not shown). Thus,
NO donors may be irrelevant to the activation of oxidative stress
responses via the NRP/B-Nrf2 pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.
H2O2 is a biologically important oxidant, generating highly
reactive hydroxyl free radicals through its interaction with redoxactive transitional metals. Cellular concentrations of H2O2 are one
of the major factors contributing to pathologic consequences. At
low concentrations (<10 Amol/L), H2O2 was shown to up-regulate
certain proteins and to stimulate the proliferation of mammalian
cells (39). However, elevated levels of H2O2 induced oxidative stress
or injury to the cells (39) and exerted increasingly inhibitory effects

on cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4).
H2O2 also induced NRP/B expression and up-regulated the NRP/BNrf2 interaction. Therefore, NRP/B up-regulation is involved in
oxidative stress responses rather than in cell growth. Furthermore,
whereas H2O2 played a crucial role in mounting oxidative stress
responses through the NRP/B-Nrf2 pathway in breast cancer cells,
NO donors seemed to have no effect on this pathway. The
distinction between NO donors and H2O2 may be due to the nature
of their biochemical reactions and cell type specificity, and may
correlate with the ability of each oxidative insult to activate the
NRP/B-Nrf2 system in breast cancer cells.
Collectively, the NRP/B-Nrf2 association is essential for activation of Nrf2-mediated NQO1. This antioxidant enzyme was
reported to be used in cancer prevention (40–42) and in enzymedirected tumor targeting (40, 43). The inducer(s)/activator(s) of
NQO1 may represent efficient protective molecule(s) for therapeutic intervention in human breast cancer. Taken together, NRP/B
plays an important role in Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress
responses, and may serve as a potential anticancer drug candidate
for breast cancer.
