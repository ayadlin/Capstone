ABSTRACT
CD90 has been identified as a marker for liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are
responsible for tumorigenic activity, but it is not known how CD90+ cells contribute to
tumor initiation and progression. Our data demonstrated that high expression of CD90
in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) tissues correlated with venous filtration in HCC
patients. CD90+ cells isolated from HCC cell lines exhibited increased tumorigenicity,
chemoresistance, tumor invasion and metastasis. Notch pathway was activated in
CD90+ cells and we found that inhibition of Notch pathway in CD90+ CSCs decreased
tumorigenicity, cell invasion, migration and expression of stem cell related genes.
Activation of Notch pathway in CD90- cells induced self-renewal, invasion and
migration. Furthermore, we observed that cancer stem cell features were facilitated
by stimulating G1-S transition in the cell cycle phase and inhibiting apoptosis
mediated by Notch pathway. Our findings suggested CD90 could be used as a potential
biomarker for HCC CSCs, and that cancer stem cell activity was elevated through up
activated Notch pathway in CD90+ CSCs.

CSCs and the molecular signaling events that regulate
cellular hierarchy, stemness, and success in defining key
CSC-specific genes [8-11].
CD90
(Thy-1)
is
a
25-37
kDa
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein
expressed mainly in leukocytes, and is involved in cellcell and cell-matrix interactions [12]. Zhen et al.’s study
reported that CD90+ cells, but not CD90- cells, from HCC
cell lines displayed tumorigenic capacity [13]. In our study
CD90+ cells not only possessed high tumor formation
ability, but also other features of cancer stem cells such as
extensive proliferation, differentiation, chemoresistance,
tumor invasion and metastasis.
The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily
conserved pathway and has been reported to promote
the self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, survival,
angiogenesis, and migration of CSCs in several
malignancies [14, 15]. It is one of the most intensively
studied candidate therapeutic targets in cancer stem cells,

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death
in men worldwide [1]. There is increasing evidence that
resistance to HCC therapy is, at least in part, caused by
inherent resistance of a subpopulation of cancer cells.
This subpopulation shares many properties with stem
cells and thus has been labeled as CSCs [2, 3]. CSCs
are highly tumorigenic, metastatic, chemotherapy and
radiation resistant, responsible for tumor relapse after
therapy, and they are also able to divide symmetrically
and asymmetrically to orchestrate tumor development
and progression [4]. Using a variety of stem cell markers,
CSCs have been identified in solid tumors, including
pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer and HCC
[4-7]. Although many CSC biomarkers (e.g., CD133,
CD13, CD24, EpCAM, Nanog) have been identified in
HCC, it is still unclear which biomarker truly represents

and several Notch inhibitors are being developed [16-18].
Zhen et al.’s study reported CD90+ cells isolated  from
normal and cirrhotic livers, tumor tissues, and blood
samples of HCC patients expressed a comparable level of
Notch1 with CD90- cells [13]. Whether Notch signaling
pathway was involved in the activation of cancer stem cell
features of CD90+ cells remained ambiguous.

implanted in Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 1). Our data showed
that 2000 CD90+ cells isolated from both PLC/PRF/5 and
Huh-7 could form tumors in 4 weeks, whereas 10,000
CD90- cells could not form any tumor over the same period
of time. Moreover, the efficiency of tumor formation
by CD90+ PLC/PRF/5 and CD90+ Huh-7 were 7/9 (no.
of mice with tumor formation/no. of mice injected) and
4/9, respectively, while CD90- cells developed no tumors.
Therefore, CD90+ cells showed significantly higher
tumorigenic capacity than CD90- cells. In addition, colony
formation assay indicated that CD90+ cells were able to
produce more and larger colonies than CD90- cells (***P
< 0.005, t test, Fig. 2D). Also, by transwell invasion and
migration assay CD90+ cells displayed significantly higher
invasive activity and migratory ability in vitro than CD90cells (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, t test, Fig. 2E, 2F).
Next, we tested whether CD90+ and CD90- cells
have different sensitivity to Sorafenib, which is a treatment
for patients with advanced HCC. We found that CD90+
cells were more resistant to 10 μM Sorafenib than CD90cells by CCK8 toxicity assay (*P < 0.05, t test, Fig. 2G).
In addition, multiple drug resistance genes, such as lung
resistance protein (LRP), and glutathione S-transferases
P1 (GSTP1) were found to be preferentially expressed in
CD90+ cells by qRT-PCR, as compared with CD90- cells
(*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, both t test, Fig. 2H). Using qRTPCR analysis, we found that CD90+ cells purified from
PLC/PRF/5 had a higher expression of stem-associated
genes Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 than that of CD90- cells
(*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both t test, Fig.
2I). Together, these data demonstrated that CD90+ cells
possessed a high capacity of tumorigenicity, invasion,
metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy, which was
consistent with crucial hallmarks in the definition of CSCs.

RESULTS
High CD90 expression in HCC clinical
specimens was associated with venous
infiltration and poor prognosis
31 pairs of human HCC and their paired
corresponding non-HCC tissues were collected from
hepatic surgery at Tongji Hospital. The expression levels
of CD90, Notch1, Nanog and Sox2 (stem cell related
genes) were evaluated in parenchymal hepatic cells
(excluding mesenchymal and vascular endothelial cells)
by IHC and found to be significantly overexpressed
in HCC (Fig. 1A, 1B). Data analysis was performed
using clinical history information of 31 HCC patients
and CD90 expression level (Table 1). There was no
significant correlation between CD90 expression and
these clinical factors, such as age, tumor size, TNM
stage, microsatellites, serum AFP level and differentiation
status. Interestingly, four out of five patients with high
CD90 expression correlated significantly with venous
infiltration (P < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Two of those
four patients have developed HCC recurrence, of the other
26 patients with low CD90 expression only occured 5
cases of recurrence and metastasis. These results indicated
that high CD90 expression which may correlate with poor
prognosis of HCC patients.

CD90+ HCC cells exhibited characteristics of
cancer stem cells

The activation of Notch signaling pathway
enhanced the cancer stem cell features of CD90HCC cells

CD90 expression was examined by flow cytometry
(FACS) analysis in a panel of HCC cell lines, including
SK-hep1, Hep3B, Huh-7, SMMC7721, MHCC-97L, PLC/
PRF/5, and MHCC-97H. Six of the cell lines expressed
CD90 ranging from 0.3%±0.2% (Hep3B) to 2.08%±0.21%
(MHCC-97H). SK-hep1 expressed CD90 at 91.1%±4.03%
(Fig. 2A). Upon culture in serum-containing medium for 1
week, magnetic beads-sorted 72.59% CD90+ PLC/PRF/5
cells gradually decreased to the original proportion (about
1-2%). Whereas CD90- cells failed to give rise to the high
CD90 expression in the same culture condition, suggesting
that CD90+ cells can differentiate into CD90- cells in
conventional culture conditions, but not vice versa (Fig.
2B). To investigate the tumor-initiating capacity of CD90+
cells in vivo, CD90+ and CD90- cells were subcutaneously

To examine whether Notch signaling was activated
in CD90+ cells, we measured the expression levels of the
core components by qRT-PCR and WB (Western blotting).
We found elevated Notch1, NICD, and downstream target
genes Hes1 and Hey1 in CD90+ cells, with CD90- cells as
controls (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both t test,
Fig. 3A). In addition, Notch pathway was activated based
on the high levels of Notch1 expression in HCC tissues
(P = 0.0002, paired t test, Fig. 1B). Hence, we proposed
Notch signaling was involved in the carcinogenesis of
CD90+ cells and furthered our study to determine whether
Notch signaling affect the tumorigenicity, invasion and
metastatic abilities of CD90+ cells. CD90- cells were
transfected with Lv-NICD, and 96 hours later, expression
levels of Notch1, NICD, Hes1, Hey1 were significantly

increased as compared to the controls. These results
suggested Notch signaling was activated by exogenous
overexpression of NICD in CD90- cells (Fig. 3B). To
detect the ability of tumor formation, CD90- cells with
Lv-NICD were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice.

After the activation of Notch pathway, 105 CD90- cells
developed tumors, whereas tumor formation needed at
least 5×105 CD90- cells transinfected with empty vector
(Supplementary Table 2). The results indicated the tumor
formation ability in vivo of CD90- cells with NICD

overexpression (8/12) was significantly enhanced, when
compared with controls (2/12, Fig. 3C). Furthermore,
elevated colony-forming capacity, invasive and migratory
ability was confirmed in CD90- cells isolated from PLC/
PRF/5 and Huh-7 with NICD overexpression (**P <
0.01, both t test, Fig. 3D, 3E, 3F). At last, CD90- cells
transinfected with Lv-NICD were treated with 5μM or
10μM Sorafenib and exhibited increased chemoresistance.
Higher expression level of stem-associated gene Sox2
was observed with activation of Notch pathway (Fig.
3G, 3H), and the expression levels of Nanog and Oct4
was invariant. Moreover, human recombinant protein
Jagged1, as one of the ligands of Notch pathway, was
always used to activate Notch signaling in vitro [19,
20]. The data showed activation of Notch pathway by
Jagged1 could induce the cancer stem cell characteristics
of CD90- cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Collectively, NICD
overexpression in CD90- cells could induce cancer stem
cell features.

CD90+ cells was significantly inhibited through LvNotch1-si (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both t test, Fig.
4A) and showed decreasing tumorigenicity (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Table 2). In addition, CD90+ cells
formed less colonies after Notch pathway was hindered,
compared with controls (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both
t test, Fig. 4C). Following the downregulation of NICD
we found that CD90+ cells were significantly weakened
the capacity of invasion (***P < 0.005, t test, Fig. 4D)
and migration (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both t test, Fig.
4E), the expression level of stem cell-associated genes
Sox2 and Nanog (Fig. 4F). Consistently, Notch pathway
inhibited by RO4929097, the γ-secretase inhibitor, could
also hinder the cancer stem cell features of CD90+ cells
(Supplementary Fig. 2). In conclusion, the downregulation
of Notch pathway diminished the cancer stem cell
characteristics of CD90+ cells.

increasing proportion of cells in S phase (*P < 0.05, t
test, Fig. 5A). No obvious differences were observed in
G2-M phase. Through qRT-PCR and WB, we detected a
series of cyclins and CDKs involved in G1-S transition
that could be potential NICD targets. The data showed that
NICD overexpression resulted in significant promotion in
CylinD1 (CCND1), CyclinE1 (CCNE1), CDK2, CDK6
and E2F1 (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, both t
test, Fig. 5B, 5C). Apoptosis proteins (cleaved-caspase3
and cleaved-caspase8), and anti-apoptosis gene (Bcl2),
are used to evaluate the degree of apoptosis. The analysis
of FACS and WB showed us the apoptosis rate of CD90cells had not been changed with the activation of Notch
signaling (Fig. 5D, 5E). Therefore, the activation of Notch
signaling induced G1-S transition in the cell cycle phase
of CD90- cells.

Recent studies indicated that the Notch pathway
promoted the tumorigenesis and radioresistance in glioma
stem cells [23, 24]. And the Notch pathway was important
in maintaining the cancer stem cell population in
pancreatic cancer [25]. However, until now there are still
no reports about the involvement in the Notch pathway
and CD90+ HCC CSCs. Our study showed Notch1 in
HCC tissues expressed much higher than non-HCC
tissues. And the Notch1 pathway was activated in CD90+
CSCs indicating Notch pathway may contribute to the
carcinogenesis of HCC. Moreover, the activation of Notch
signaling pathway enhanced the cancer stem cell features
of CD90- HCC cells, and the inhibition of Notch pathway
attenuated the cancer stem cell properties of CD90+ cells.
Taken together, the Notch pathway could promote the
cancer stem cell characteristics of CD90+ CSCs and may
be an attractive therapeutic target for HCC patients.
Maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic
stem cells is governed by the expression of the core
transcription factors Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, as well as
a variety of other factors [26]. Sox2 and Nanog are also
involved in the maintain CSCs of solid tumors [27, 28].
In our research, we found that the expression levels of
Sox2 and Nanog in HCC tissues were much higher than
non-tumors and positively related with NICD expression
in CD90+ CSCs. This result suggested that Sox2 and
Nanog probably contributed to the cancer stem cell
characteristics of CD90+ CSCs through Notch pathway.
According to Xu et al.’s study, Sox2 could at least partially
control Notch pathway through binding to Notch1 and
Notch2 regulatory regions in lung adeno carcinoma [29].
Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 have been shown to repress the
expression of developmental genes while modulating their
own expression levels by binding to each other’s promoter
regions [30, 31]. However, the role which Sox2 and
Nanog played in Notch signaling in CD90+ CSCs, have
not been reported until now and still needed our further
investigation.
In our previous study, Notch signaling could induce
apoptosis and block G1-S transition to interrupt the
occurrence and development of HCC [32, 33]. This study
demonstrated that CD90+ cells was inhibited in the G1-S
transition and induced apoptosis while Notch pathway
was disrupted. While CD90- cells were accelerated in
G1-S transition after activation of Notch signaling. But
the apoptosis rate of CD90- cells had not been increased
with the activation of Notch signaling. Probably because
the PLC/PRF/5 cell line was in very good condition and
the apoptosis rate could be quite low.
Taken together, we may conclude that CD90 is a
prognostic marker for HCC and characterize CD90+ cells as
hepatic CSCs. Furthermore, our data established that Notch
pathway stimulated the cancer stem cell characteristics of
CD90+ cells through cell cycle and apoptosis.

The inhibition of Notch signaling suppressed
G1-S transition in the cell cycle phase and
promoted apoptosis of CD90+ HCC cells
CD90+ cells exhibited ascending proportion of cells
in G0-G1 phase and an decreasing proportion of cells
after Notch signaling was inhibited by RO or Lv-Notch1si (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, both t test, Fig. 6A). Western
Blotting also demonstrated that a panel of genes involved
in G1-S transition decreased at protein levels (Fig. 6B).
In CD90+ cells with knockdown of NICD the apoptosis
rate by FACS analysis was increased (*P < 0.05, ***P <
0.005, both t test, Fig. 6C). Apoptosis associated proteins
cleaved-caspase3, and cleaved-caspase8 presented a rising
trend, and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 decreased on the
contrary (Fig. 6D). Hence, inhibition of Notch signaling
suppressed G1-S transition in the cell cycle phase of
CD90+ cells and promoted apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
Consistent with Sukowati et al.’s study [21],
we also observed that only a minority of cells in HCC
tissues demonstrateded CD90 expression, whereas CD90
expression was hardly observed in the non-tumor liver
tissues. Of note, strong positive overexpression of CD90
was significantly correlated with venous infiltration in
HCC patients. Those HCC patients could be more likely
to develop HCC metastasis and poor prognosis. But it
has not ever been proposed that the underlying biological
mechanism about CD90 in HCC [4, 22]. Our vitro
experiments showed that CD90+ cells derived from HCC
cell lines possessed a high capacity of tumorigenicity,
invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy.
Therefore, our study demonstrated that CD90+ HCC cells
displayed the capacity to initiate and sustain tumor growth,
leading eventually to cancer metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor formation assay

Clinical specimens

NOD/SCID mice at age of 3-5 weeks, male, were
maintained in pathogen-free conditions at animal facility
of Tongji Medical College and received humane care
according to the criteria outlined in the “Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the
National Academy of Sciences. The different numbers of
CD90+ and CD90- cells were resuspended in serum-free
medium and were mixed with Matrigel at the ratio of 1:1.
The cells were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice.
Tumor formation was evaluated regularly after injection
by palpation of injection sites.

HCC and non-HCC samples were obtained with
informed consent from patients who had undergone
radical resection at the Hepatic Surgery in Tongji Hospital
(Wuhan, China). The tissue acquisition procedures were
approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital. A
total of 31 pairs of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
human HCC and corresponding non-HCC tissues, for
immunhistochemistry were obtained from 2013 to 2014.
The staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 as
negative (0), weak (1), medium (2) or strong (3). The
extent of the staining, defined as the percentage of positive
staining areas of tumor cells in relation to the whole tumor
area, was scored on a scale of 0 to 4: 0(0%), 1 (1–25%),
2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%) and 4 (76–100%). An overall
protein expression score (overall score range, 0–12) was
calculated by multiplying the intensity and positivity
scores. For statistical analysis, a final staining score
greater than zero was considered to be positive sample.
IHC staining score ≥10 was defined as high expression.

Lentiviral-based transfection into HCC cells
For suppression or activation of the Notch pathway
in sorted HCC cells, lentiviral particles (Genechem,
Shanghai) expressing Notch1-siRNA or NICD were used
in our study. The siRNA sequence targeted Notch1 was
listed as follows: 5'-GGAGCATGTGTAACATCAA-3'.
For optimization of transfection conditions with lentiviral
vectors, HCC cells were infected with Lv-NICD or LvNotch1-si at different of multiplicity of infection (MOI) for
12 hours in the presence of 5μg/ml of polybrene. Two days
after infection, expression of green florescence protein
was measured by FACS analysis. Our data showed that
infection of sorted cells at MOI of 10 resulted in more than
90% of efficiency of infection without damaging cells.

Cell culture
Human HCC cell lines (SK-hep1, Hep3B, Huh7, SMMC7721, MHCC-97L, PLC/PRF/5 and MHCC97H) were purchased from the Shanghai Cell Collection
(Shanghai, China). All cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO)
at 37°C, 5% CO2 condition.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well
in six well plates and allowed to grow for six days. Clones
were fixed by 4% methanol and dye with Giemsa (Sigma
Aldrich) and clone (>50 cells) numbers were counted
microscopically.

Flow cytometry analysis
Adherent and suspended cells were dissociated
into single cells and labeled with PE-conjugated CD90
human antibody (clone 5E10, BD PharMingen) at 4°C
for 15 minutes. Concentrations of antibodies were used
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
The stained cells were analyzed with the FACS Calibur
machine and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Migration and invasion assays
The migration assay was performed as described
[11]. The invasion assay was performed as described
[10]. Photographs of three randomly selected fields of
the fixed cells were captured and cells were counted. The
experiments were repeated independently three times.

Isolation of CD90+ and CD90– populations by
magnetic bead cell sorting

CCK8 toxic assays

For magnetic cell sorting, cells were labeled with
CD90 microbeads human antibody (Miltenyi Biotec,
Germany). Sorting was carried out with the Miltenyi
Biotec MidiMACS Starting Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Magnetic separation was
performed up to three times to obtain a CD90+ population
more than 70% pure. Aliquots of CD90+ and CD90- sorted
cells were evaluated for purity with a FACS Calibur
machine and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

The sensitivity of CD90+ and CD90- cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs sorafenib was measured by CCK8
assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
then were treated with various concentrations (5 μM or
10 μM) of sorafenib (Sigma-Aldrich) at second day, coincubated for 24h, or 36h or 48h. After changing to fresh
medium without sorafenib, cells were then added CCK8
reagent (Promoter, Wuhan) to each well according to the

analyses. In all cases, P < 0.05 was considered with
statistical significant.

Western blot

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

For immunoblotting, equal amounts of proteins
(30~80μg) were separated on 10%–12% SDS-PAGE
and were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF
membranes (Millipore), which were blocked in TBST
containing 5% defatted milk for 1 hour at RT and then
blotted with antibody overnight at 4°C: anti-Nanog
(1:1000, Cell signaling), anti-Oct4 (1:1000, Cell
signaling), anti-Sox2 (1:1000, Cell signaling), antiCyclinD1 (1:1000, Cell signaling), anti-CyclinE1 (1:1000,
Cell signaling), anti-E2F1 (1:1000, Cell signaling), antiCDK2 (1:1000, Cell signaling), anti-CDK6 (1:1000, Cell
signaling) and anti-β-actin (1:1000, Cell signaling). After
being washed with TBST and incubation with either antirabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:5000, Promoter Wuhan) in TBST
containing 5% nonfat milk, immune complexes were
visualized using the Beyo ECL Plus.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on
formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
the labeled streptavidin biotinperoxidase complex method.
The procedure for IHC Antibody used for detection of
Nanog, Sox2, Oct4 and Notch1 was from Cell Signaling.
The staining intensity and the extent of staining were
scored as described [11]. For statistical analysis, a final
staining score greater than zero was considered to be
positive sample.

Quantitative RT–PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cancer cells using
RNAiso Plus (Takara, Japan). The cDNA synthesis was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Takara, PrimeScript RT Master Mix). Quantitative PCR
was performed by SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara,
DRR081A) using a Stepone Real-Time System (Bio-rad).
PCR reaction conditions for all assays were 94°C for 30
seconds, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (94°C for
5 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds).
β-actin mRNA was used to normalize RNA inputs. RT–
PCR primers were as described in Supplementary Table 3.
