BACKGROUND. The addition of diethylstilbestrol to docetaxel modified tubulin
composition and improved the response of prostate cancer to chemotherapy in
preclinical models. An attempt was made to recapitulate the observations in a
clinical trial.

METHODS. Twenty-nine patients with progressive, metastatic, chemotherapy-naive androgen-independent prostate cancer were treated with diethylstilbestrol
1 mg daily and 5 mg on the day before docetaxel and docetaxel 36 mg/m2 intra-

RESULTS. The median age was 68 years (range, 56–84 years), Southwest Oncology
(range, 49–523), hemoglobin (Hgb) 12.6 g/dL (range, 9.2–16.3), PSA 66 ng/dL
(range, 4–1962). The median number of cycles administered was 6. Soft tissue
nine patients are evaluable for response. Of these, 20 patients (69%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 49%–85%) had a PSA decline of >50% and the PSA declined
by >90% in 12 patients (41%, 95% CI, 23.1%–58.9%). Of 15 patients with measurable disease, 6 (40%, 95% CI, 23.5%–61%) had a partial response. Median time to
progression was 6 months (range, 3–19 months). Fifteen patients (51%) suffered
grade 3/4 toxicity. Two patients died of causes unrelated to therapy and another
died from a steroid-induced ulcer. Six patients developed thrombosis and of
those tested 75% had Factor V mutations. Pretreatment PSA, performance status,
Hgb, and alkaline phosphatase had no impact on the likelihood of response.

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of diethylstilbestrol and docetaxel produces a
significant level of activity, measured by PSA decline and measurable disease

expectancy is extended by an average of only 2 to 3
months, and few men achieve a complete
response.2,3 Improving the efficacy of docetaxel by
exploiting mechanisms by which prostate cancer
escapes chemotherapy-induced cell death could significantly enhance the clinical benefits of therapy.
Preclinical data showed that combining the synthetic
ethinyl estrogen diethylstilbestrol with docetaxel
improves the response in human prostate cancer
xenografts compared with docetaxel alone.4 Diethylstilbestrol may mediate this effect through modulation of the docetaxel target, b-tubulin, or by
influencing other mechanisms of resistance to androgen deprivation and chemotherapy.4,5 Diethylstilbestrol as a single agent has activity against AIPC,
despite the apparent ‘androgen independence’ of the
disease.6 Proposed mechanisms for effect of hormonal agents in AIPC focus on suppression of androgens from extragonadal sources, such as the adrenal
gland. However, diethylstilbestrol and estrogens in
general appear to have additional effects that are independent of testicular and adrenal androgens.
Estrogens suppress prostate cancer growth in vitro in
androgen-starved conditions and in castrate murine
models where there are no gonadal or adrenal androgens.7,8 Diethylstilbestrol induces arrest at the G2-M
phase of the cell cycle, a point in the cycle that is
critical to achieving taxane-mediated cell death.9
Alternatively, diethylstilbestrol may stabilize cellular
microtubules through direct binding to the b-tubulin
molecule, augmenting G2-M arrest and cell death in
combination with the known microtubule-stabilizing
effects of taxanes.10 Finally, diethylstilbestrol is a very
effective inhibitor of enzymes of androgen steroidogenesis, and may inhibit these enzymes in adrenal
and tumor tissue to suppress tissue androgen
levels.11–14 Thus, there are several well-documented
mechanisms that led us to formulate the hypothesis
that diethylstilbestrol would enhance the activity of
docetaxel in patients with AIPC. We tested this
approach in a prospective phase II study of weekly
docetaxel with continuous diethylstilbestrol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, adenocarcinoma of the prostate with metastases and evidence of disease progression (worsening bone scan,
increase in measurable disease or prostate-specific
antigen [PSA] >5 ng/mL and increasing on 2 consecutive measurements) despite at least 1 endocrine
manipulation and testosterone levels <0.5 ng/mL.
Patients treated with antiandrogens were required to

997

demonstrate progressive disease despite discontinuation of antiandrogen for at least 6 weeks. Androgen
deprivation with a luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) agonist or orchiectomy was
required for the duration of the study. Other inclusion criteria were a Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) performance status of 0–2, a baseline leukocyte count 3000/lL, neutrophil count 1500/lL,
hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, platelet count 100,000/lL,
serum creatinine 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), calcium ULN, bilirubin 1.5 times the
ULN and AST/ALT 2 times the ULN, adequate cardiac function, and a life expectancy of more than 3
months. Patients who had received prior chemotherapy, estrogens, or PC-SPES were excluded, as were
patients with a history of thrombosis, cardiac or
cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmia, or contraindications to anticoagulation. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients and the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review boards at the University of Washington and
Oregon Health & Science University and the research
committees of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Puget Sound
and Portland VAMC.

Treatment Regimen
Diethylstilbestrol (compounded by the investigational
drug pharmacy) was given orally as a single dose of
5 mg on the day before docetaxel, and then 1 mg
daily. Docetaxel (Taxotere, Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) 36 mg/m2 was administered intravenously over 30–60 minutes on Day 2 of
each treatment week. Treatment was administered
weekly for 3 consecutive weeks on a 4-week cycle
until disease progression, development of grade 4
adverse event, withdrawal of consent, or for a maximum of 10 cycles. Dexamethasone 4 mg orally 12
hours and 1 hour before infusion and 6 hours after
docetaxel administration was also administered. Warfarin 2 mg and aspirin 325 mg daily were given orally
in an attempt to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications. Enoxaparin 40 mg daily was used if
patients were allergic to aspirin. Prophylactic breast
irradiation of 1200 cGy was administered to reduce
the risk of gynecomastia.
Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluation included medical history, a
physical examination, a complete blood count with
differential and platelet count, a chemistry profile, a
serum PSA concentration, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a chest x-ray, a bone scan, and computerized
tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis.

On-study evaluations included history, physical
examination, serum PSA, liver function studies, complete blood count, PT, aPTT, and adverse event monitoring every 4 weeks. Complete blood count and
adverse monitoring was performed before each docetaxel administration. Bone scans and CT scans of
measurable disease were performed every 3 months
or as clinically indicated. PSA levels were determined
every 4 weeks. Toxicity was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (v.
3.0).

Criteria for Discontinuation and Dose Modifications
Patients could remain on study if they developed
deep venous thrombosis and could be therapeutically anticoagulated. Patients were taken off study if
they developed pulmonary embolism, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident. Treatment was held for platelet count less than
100,000/mm3 or neutrophil count less than 1000/
mm3. Docetaxel was reduced by 25% if patients
developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, or grade 4 neutropenia that lasted longer than
7 days. Docetaxel was reduced by 25% if AST was 1.6
to 5 times the ULN when bilirubin remained in the
normal range and alkaline phosphatase was <5 times
the ULN. Therapy was withheld for bilirubin greater
than ULN, alkaline phosphatase more than 5 times
the ULN, or ALT was more than 5 times the ULN.
Therapy was resumed at a 25% dose reduction in
patients with recovery of liver function tests to normal limits within 2 weeks.
Definitions of Response
A PSA decline of over 50% that was maintained for at
least 28 days was required for PSA response. PSA
progression was defined as a 25% increase in PSA
over nadir, confirmed by a second PSA at least 1
week later. A complete PSA response required normalization of PSA (<4 ng/mL) for at least 28 days.
Response criteria for measurable disease were: complete response required complete disappearance of
all evidence of all sites of measurable or osseous disease with normalization of the PSA level (defined as
PSA <4 ng/mL). Partial response was defined as per
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria, and a 50% or greater reduction in
PSA without the appearance of new osseous lesions
and worsening of pathologic findings. Progressive
disease (PD) was defined by progression of PSA
levels, an increase in the size of existent bone
lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new bone
lesions identified by bone scan. Time to progression
was measured from the first day of treatment to the

time of PD. Overall survival was measured from the
initiation of therapy to the date of death or last follow-up.

Statistical Design
The sample size was chosen with the goal of detecting a 20% increase in the PSA response rate over that
seen with single-agent weekly docetaxel seen in
phase II studies. The null hypothesis was that the
combination would have a response rate of no
greater than 40% (the expected response rate with
single-agent docetaxel). The alternative hypothesis
was that the combination would produce a PSA
response rate of at least 60%. The study was
designed with a 5 0.05 and power of 80% to detect
this magnitude of response. On the basis of these parameters, the total sample size was to be 39 with 34
patients enrolled in the first stage and stage II
accrual if 18 of 34 patients responded. The study was
stopped after sufficient activity in stage I was documented, but before the planned accrual was achieved
because of discontinuation of funding.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

was 66 ng/mL. Bidimensionally measurable extraosseous disease was present in 15 (51%) patients and 27
(93%) demonstrated bone metastasis. A median of 6
consecutive cycles of therapy was administered
(range, 1–10).
Twenty-nine patients are evaluable for response.
Of these, 20 patients (69%, 95% confidence interval
[CI], 49%–85%) had a PSA decline by >50% and the
PSA declined by >90% in 12 patients (41%). Of 15
patients with measurable disease, 6 (40%, 95% CI,
22%–61%) had a partial response. Median time to
progression was 6 months (range, 3–19 months).
There were no clear differences in PSA, Hgb, performance status or alkaline phosphatase between the
patients who responded and those who did not have
a PSA or objective response. Fifteen patients suffered
grade 3 or 4 toxicity (Table 2), including elevated
INR while on low-dose Warfarin (1 patient), deep venous thrombosis (6 patients), diarrhea (2 patients),
neutropenia (1 patient), anemia (1 patient), and
edema (1 patient). Two patients developed interstitial
pneumonitis that responded to dexamethasone and
another developed infectious pneumonia. Two
patients died of causes unrelated to therapy, and
another died from a steroid-induced ulcer. The principal toxicity of diethylstilbestrol is thrombosis and
patients were prophylactically given Warfarin 2 mg
and aspirin 325 mg daily or enoxaparin in the event
of an aspirin allergy. Despite this therapy, 6 patients
developed deep venous thrombosis, 2 associated

999

with venous catheters. No patients suffered pulmonary emboli or cardiovascular complications. Four
patients continued on study with full anticoagulation
as per protocol, and 1 had a recurrent deep venous
thrombosis and was taken off study. Of the patients
with thrombosis, 4 were tested for factor V Leiden
mutations and 3 were positive.

DISCUSSION
The development of androgen independence and
progressive metastatic disease remains the cause of
death for over 27,000 men per year in the US. Optimizing response and survival for these patients currently relies on the use of docetaxel with prednisone,
which improves survival by a median of 2–3
months.2,3 Overcoming intrinsic prostate cancer resistance to docetaxel is 1 of the most promising
means of further improving outcomes for patients
with advanced disease. Previous studies of the use of
estrogens for patients with androgen-independent
disease showed response rates of 14% to 50%, largely
in asymptomatic patients.6,15 The highest response
rates were observed with the use of diethylstilbestrol,
a synthetic ethinyl estrogen that has no structural
similarity to natural estrogens or estramustine, and
an extensive history of use as primary androgen deprivation for patients with advanced disease. The efficacy of diethylstilbestrol in ‘androgen independent’
disease has been ascribed to multiple hormonal and
cytotoxic mechanisms. Diethylstilbestrol suppresses
serum DHEA-S and testosterone in patients with
androgen-independent disease.16,17 This reduction in
serum levels is likely mediated through inhibition of
17,20 lyase/17alpha hydroxylase and 3-b hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in the adrenal gland or
other steroidogenic tissues.11–14 Diethylstilbestrol
also modulates levels and stability of b-tubulin, an
integral component of the prostate cancer mitotic
apparatus and the principal target of the taxanes.
Sharp and Parry9 demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol
modulated microtubule polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner. Diethylstilbestrol induces
cell cycle arrest at G2-M, which is required for docetaxel-induced apoptosis.18 Our group previously
demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol exposure selectively inhibited the expression of taxane-resistant btubulin isoforms, improving the therapeutic efficacy
of docetaxel in human prostate cancer xenografts.4
The effects of diethylstilbestrol on tubulins are distinct from estradiol and other estrogens and appears
to be independent of engagement of the estrogen receptor.4 Estramustine is another estrogenic agent
used in the treatment of prostate cancer, and is a

congener of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard.
Diethylstilbestrol has greater activity than estramustine in the treatment of patients with advanced
disease and has effects on tubulin and cell cycle that
are distinct from those of estramustine.19–21 The preclinical synergism seen when combining docetaxel
with diethylstilbestrol was the basis for its inclusion
in this trial. The addition of diethylstilbestrol improved the response rate from the anticipated 40% to
approximately 70% in this study, suggesting additional response benefits from the combination.
Although the PSA response rate is not substantially
different from that seen in early phase studies with
docetaxel combined with estramustine, the objective
response rate of 40% seen in this study is better than
the 20% to 30% response rates previously reported in
phase II or III studies, as is the rate of PSA normalization.22–26 These measures would suggest that the
combination of diethylstilbestrol with docetaxel is
affecting cancer growth rather than simply suppressing PSA gene transcription and carries the potential
for better clinical outcomes than docetaxel with or
without estramustine. It is also important to note
that early phase studies such as this are hypothesisgenerating, and direct comparison to docetaxel and
prednisone would be necessary to determine whether
this regimen offers an advantage.
The additional response rate achieved with
diethylstilbestrol carries with it an increased risk of
thrombosis. A substantial number of patients developed venous thrombosis despite prophylaxis with
the combination of warfarin 2 mg with full-dose aspirin. The majority of these patients, most of whom
had responses to therapy, were able to continue with
full-dose anticoagulation. The hypercoagulability
associated with diethylstilbestrol is thought to be a
result of the first-pass effect through the liver that
occurs with oral administration, inducing factors II,
VII, IX, and X. Induction of hypercoagulability and
coagulation factors occurs at a much lower frequency when estrogens are administered transdermally or intramuscularly.15,27 It is possible that
thrombotic risk with diethylstilbestrol preferentially
affects patients heterozygous for Factor V mutations
that occur in 10% to 15% of the population as a
whole. Given the inability to prevent thrombosis with
the tested combination of low-dose Warfarin with aspirin, alternative modes of administration or prophylaxis could be considered in further studies. An
equivalent level of thrombotic risk is associated with
the use of agents such as thalidomide with dexamethasone when used to treat multiple myeloma.
Although low-dose Warfarin does not effectively
reduce the 30% risk of venous thromboembolism

seen with thalidomide and dexamethasone, standard-dose prophylaxis has reduced this risk to background levels and has become the standard of
care.28 Other toxicities were similar to those seen in
other studies of docetaxel alone. Interstitial pneumonitis related to docetaxel has been reported at a variable frequency, often in combination with other
agents.29–31 As has been previously reported, the
patients who developed pneumonitis responded well
to short-course corticosteroids without long-term
sequelae.
Estrogens have long been a staple in the treatment of prostate cancer but fell out of favor because
of the thrombophilia associated with oral administration. In some studies the use of diethylstilbestrol
carried better cancer-specific survival rates than
orchiectomy, but these advantages were offset by the
cardiovascular complications.32 Recent work by several groups has demonstrated that parenteral estrogens either offset or prevent morbid complications of
androgen deprivation, including osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction, and hot flashes.15,27,33–35 Many of
the complications of androgen deprivation may
result from the combined loss of both androgens and
estrogens as serum androgens in men are primarily
derived through aromatization of testosterone. The
potential advantages of estrogens in quality of life,
potential utility in combinations with chemotherapy,
and economic terms should drive additional research
into how the toxicities might be prevented while
maintaining the molecular and hormonal efficacy.
This phase II study demonstrates that the use of
diethylstilbestrol can improve the PSA and objective
response rate to docetaxel substantially. The effects
of diethylstilbestrol may be achieved through modulation of the drug target (b-tubulin) or improving tissue androgen suppression by blocking tissue
metabolism of adrenal androgens to dihydrotestosterone. The challenge will be to administer diethylstilbestrol by means that avoid the anticipated
thrombotic toxicities and to develop new, less toxic
compounds, such as phenoxodiol, which circumvent
drug resistance via different mechanisms.36

Conclusions
The addition of diethylstilbestrol in this phase II
study adds to the PSA response achieved with docetaxel alone in patients with androgen-independent
prostate cancer, with the advantage of availability
and ease of administration. The measurable disease
response rate is also impressive, although the number of patients available for analysis of this endpoint
is small and conclusions about improved response
rates will require randomized comparison to the

established standard regimen of docetaxel with prednisone. Toxicity overall is similar to that seen with
docetaxel, with the added risk of venous thrombosis
associated with diethylstilbestrol. Estrogens, and
diethylstilbestrol in particular, have effects in prostate
cancer that might be expected to improve response
to taxanes, through modulation of the tubulin target
and suppression of androgen metabolism. Improving
outcomes for patients with prostate cancer will rely
on the design of agents that can abrogate both drug
and androgen resistance in a manner similar to that
achieved with diethylstilbestrol.
