BACKGROUND: This study examined the impact of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) on physical function and quality of life
(QOL) over 36 months. METHODS: Eighty-seven men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PC) who were starting continuous ADT
and 2 control groups (86 PC controls without ADT and 86 healthy controls), matched by age and education, were enrolled. Physical
function was assessed with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), grip strength, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. QOL was measured with
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjects were assessed at the baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24,
30, and 36 months. Mixed effects regression models were fitted with adjustments for baseline covariates. RESULTS: The 6MWT distance improved initially and then stabilized in both control groups but remained unchanged for ADT users (P 5.0030). Grip strength
remained stable in control groups but declined sharply in the ADT group by 3 months and then remained stable to 36 months
(P 5.0041). TUG scores declined gradually in the ADT group over 36 months but were unchanged in control groups (P 5.0008).
Aggregate physical QOL declined in ADT users over time but remained stable in control groups (P 5.0001). Aggregate mental QOL
was stable in all groups. Declines seen in the first year of ADT use generally persisted over 36 months and were independent of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously noted physical side effects over the first 12 months of ADT persisted or continued to worsen over an
additional 2 years with no evidence of recovery. Exercise interventions to counteract these declines may be warranted. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 50% of men with prostate cancer (PC) will receive androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) at some time
after their diagnosis,1 and most will take it for at least 2 to 3 years. ADT is associated with numerous adverse effects,
including poorer quality of life (QOL), sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anemia, osteoporosis, and muscle loss.2
We previously described the effects of 12 months of continuous ADT on physical function in men with nonmetastatic PC. Using a matched cohort study, we demonstrated deleterious effects of ADT on endurance (as measured by the
6-minute walk test [6MWT]), upper extremity strength (as measured by grip strength), and lower extremity function (as
measured by the Timed Up and Go [TUG] test) in comparison with controls.3 These effects were noted within 3 to 6
months of the initiation of ADT and persisted over 12 months of follow-up. Declines in objective physical function
were accompanied by reductions in self-reported physical QOL. Similar findings have been reported in other longitudinal
studies.4-7
Maintenance of physical function is important to prevent disability8 and improve survival9 and well-being in older
men. Mounting evidence has demonstrated improvements in physical fitness and QOL in men receiving ADT who
engage in regular physical exercise,10 but benefits have been modest, and men with PC typically remain physically

inactive.11 Importantly, most men starting ADT remain
on it for at least 2 to 3 years, so it is important to determine whether the observed 12-month declines in physical
function with ADT persist, worsen, or resolve over time.
Also, although we did not previously observe a differential
effect of ADT on physical function with age, the relatively
short follow-up of our prior study may have been insufficient to detect age-related differences. We, therefore,
conducted a 2-year extension study of the ADT users and
matched controls described in our prior report.3

assess lower extremity function.17 Declines in lower
extremity function are predictive of subsequent disability
in older adults.18
QOL was measured with the 36-Item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36) of the Medical Outcomes Study,19
a widely used self-report generic QOL instrument. The
SF-36 includes 2 summary scales, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS), along with 8 domain scales. The PCS was
our primary QOL outcome because of the hypothesized
impact of ADT on physical function.
Secondary outcomes included the SF-36 MCS, the
Barthel score (a measure of basic activities of daily living
[ADL]),20 the Lawton-Brody index (a measure of instrumental ADL),21 and the Geriatric Depression Scale
(a measure of mood).22

The study design has been described in detail previously3
and is summarized here. Men with nonmetastatic PC
commencing continuous ADT (ADT users) were enrolled
along with 2 matched-control groups: men with PC who
were not taking ADT (PC controls) and healthy controls
without PC. Men in each group were frequency-matched
by age, education, and walking independence at the baseline as described previously.3
Subjects were excluded if they had another active
malignancy, had a life expectancy of less than 1 year, were
not fluent in English, had a major neuropsychiatric abnormality, or were unable to ambulate without assistance.
Subjects were recruited from 2 tertiary care academic cancer centers in Toronto, Canada between May 2004 and
September 2007. The study was approved by the research
ethics boards at both participating hospitals. Subjects
reconsented after the 1-year visit for 2 additional years of
follow-up.
At the baseline, we collected sociodemographic and
medical information on all subjects. Comorbidity was
captured with the Charlson index.12

As detailed in our primary report,3 our sample size calculation was based on detecting differences larger than
the minimum clinically important difference (MCID)
on both the SF-36 PCS (5 points) and the 6MWT
(54 meters) for 12-month outcomes.13,23 For longer term
outcomes, assuming a 5% dropout rate per year,
simulation-based analyses suggested greater than 95%
power to detect between-group differences at least as large
as the MCID for both outcomes.

Outcome Variables

Statistical Analyses

Our primary outcomes were objective physical function
and the self-reported physical component of QOL. A
third major outcome was cognitive function, which will
be reported separately.
Objective physical function was measured with 3
standardized physical performance measures: 6MWT,
grip strength, and TUG task. The 6MWT is a submaximal exercise test that has been used extensively in studies
of middle-aged and older adults13; poorer performance is
associated with greater disability, morbidity, and mortality.13,14 Grip strength reflects upper extremity strength
and is an independent predictor of mortality in older
adults.15 Grip strength was measured thrice in each arm
with a Jamar dynamometer.16 The TUG task was used to

Baseline characteristics for all patients were summarized
with means for continuous variables and with frequencies
for categorical variables. Comparisons of cohorts at the
baseline used analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Primary and secondary outcomes were treated as
continuous measures and analyzed with linear mixed
effects regression models, which take into account
repeated and potentially correlated measurements within
each subject and allow the inclusion of data on subjects
who have only partial follow-up. Measurements at the 8
time points were the dependent variables. The regressors
were time and cohort (ADT users, PC controls, and
healthy controls) and terms representing a time-cohort

Follow-Up Assessments

Subjects were evaluated 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36
months after their baseline visit. At each visit, objective
physical function was measured, and QOL questionnaires
were administered. Changes in health status and medications were also recorded.

interaction, with healthy controls as the referent for all
comparisons. We used an autocorrelation structure to
account for the within-subject dependence of measurements over time. The following covariates were included
in the model on the basis of clinical judgment and our
prior results3: age, education, body mass index, and
Charlson index score. This analysis provided an estimate
for the average difference in the rate of change in outcome
measures over 36 months. Between-cohort analyses were
also undertaken at each time point. Plots of trajectories
over time suggested that for some outcomes, slopes over
the initial 6 months and the subsequent 30 months were
different. We fitted segmented regression models with a
join point at 6 months to allow estimation and formal
testing of hypotheses about these slopes. We used a
P value of .05 without adjustment to denote statistical
significance in all analyses.24
Following our previous publication3 and guidelines
on reporting patient-reported outcomes to maximize
interpretability,25 we also examined the proportion of
men in each cohort who improved, remained stable, or
worsened on an annual basis. Improvement and worsening were defined as positive and negative changes, respectively, in an outcome that exceeded the published MCID
for that outcome; those not improving or worsening were
deemed stable. This ordinal variable was compared
between groups with the Kruskal-Wallis chi-square test.
To determine whether the effects of ADT differed
by age group, we repeated the aforementioned analyses
after stratifying patients by age: <65 years, 65 to 74 years,
and 75 years or older. This analysis was prespecified and
exploratory.
Our main analysis assumed that the hypogonadism
induced by ADT would persist for at least 12 months after
ADT was stopped. In an exploratory analysis, we modeled
ADT use as a time-dependent covariate to see whether
this would affect our main findings.
Patients who dropped out from the study may have
had poorer function, on average, than the remaining participants. To check the robustness of our findings against
this possibility, we ran a sensitivity analysis in which we
randomly imputed missing data from the worst quintiles
of observed outcomes in the same cohort at the same time
point. Data that were missing because a patient died or
withdrew from the study on account of disease progression were not imputed.
Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical
Analysis Software 9.2 (SAS Institute, Research Triangle,
NC) and R 3.0.2 (Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).

RESULTS
A total of 87 ADT users, 86 PC controls, and 86 healthy
controls were recruited between May 2004 and September
2007. Men were well matched between cohorts with a
mean age of 69 years and similar performances on all 3 tests
of physical function (all ANOVAs, P > .20). Subjects had
few major comorbidities and were highly functional at the
baseline, as evidenced by nearly perfect scores on both ADL
indices. Other baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Dropout and early discontinuation (due to death or
disease progression) were similar across all 3 cohorts and
over time. By the end of the study, 167 of the 259 patients
(64%) remained in the study. The largest number of participants dropped out after the 1-year visit at the time of
consenting to the extension study. Details are provided in
Supporting Table 1 (see online supporting information).
With respect to actual time on ADT in the ADT
user cohort, ADT users were followed for a mean of 28.6
months and a median of 36 months, respectively. For
these same ADT users, the mean and median numbers of
months of ADT use were 24.8 and 29.3 months, respectively. In slightly different terms, ADT users contributed
212.5 patient-years of follow-up, and 163 of these
patient-years were spent on ADT (76.7% of patient-years
on study). Time on ADT among ADT users is shown in
Supporting Figure 1 (see online supporting information).
Changes in Objective Physical Function
Over Time

Mixed effects regression models from the baseline to 36
months demonstrated statistically significant differences
between ADT users and controls for all 3 objective physical
function outcomes (Fig. 1). Specifically, ADT users had
worse performance than controls on the 6MWT, with both
control groups demonstrating initial increases in the 6MWT
distance walked over time in the first 6 months of the study
in comparison with ADT users (P 5 .003; all reported comparisons are with healthy controls). Subsequently, all 3 groups
remained relatively stable over time (Fig. 1A). Grip strength
declined at 3 months in ADT users and then stabilized over
time, in contrast to PC controls and healthy controls, who
did not exhibit a significant decline over time (P 5 .004;
Fig. 1B). TUG scores remained stable or improved slightly in
both control groups, whereas there was a gradual worsening
of TUG scores among ADT users (P < .001; Fig. 1C). These
results generally confirmed our prior report.3
To further understand changes over time, we used
segmented regression to examine early (0-6 months) and
late changes (6-36 months) in each outcome. This analysis
confirmed statistically significant differences in the 6MWT

respectively) but similar trajectories from 6 to 36 months
for both outcomes (P 5 .23 and P 5 .13, respectively). In
contrast, TUG scores were not different between ADT
users and controls over 0 to 6 months (P 5 .92) but were
different between 6 and 36 months (P 5 .0026).

Changes in Self-Reported Physical Function
Over Time

The proportions of men who improved, remained stable,
or worsened by the MCID between the baseline and 36
months of follow-up are shown in Table 2. A greater proportion of ADT users experienced worsening in comparison with the 2 control groups in the measures of grip
strength, TUG, and PCS but not in the 6MWT or secondary outcome measures.

Patients in all 3 cohorts had similar baseline SF-36 PCS
scores (ANOVA, P > .20). Overall, PCS scores declined
in ADT users but remained stable in both control groups
(P < .001; Fig. 1D). These differences were mainly due
to divergence over the first 6 months, as confirmed by
segmented regression (data not shown).

No differences were noted in baseline scores in either the
Barthel index or the Lawton-Brody index across cohorts
(ANOVA, P > .20). Scores remained stable over time in
all 3 cohorts on the Barthel index (P 5 .44; Fig. 1F) as
well as the Lawton-Brody index (P 5 .89; Fig. 1G).

In general, effects of ADT were not statistically
different by age group for any of the objective physical
performance measures or self-reported measures. The
1 exception was the TUG task (data not shown).
Exploratory and Sensitivity Analyses

Analyzing ADT as a time-dependent covariate had no material effect on any of our findings (data not shown).
Imputing missing data from the worst quintile of
respondents did not materially affect any of the primary
outcomes but suggested worsening Barthel index
(P 5 .013) and Lawton-Brody index scores (P 5 .010)
among ADT users versus controls with imputation of
missing data (Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting
information]).
DISCUSSION
In a cohort of ADT users, PC controls, and healthy controls, we examined changes over 36 months in objective
physical performance and self-reported physical function.
Compared with controls, ADT users exhibited worse performance in endurance (6MWT distance), upper extremity strength (grip strength), lower extremity function
2354

(TUG), and perceived physical function. Most of the
declines occurred in the first 6 months of ADT use and
remained stable thereafter. Finally, these effects were seen
in middle-aged men, young-old men (65-74 years old),
and older men (75 years old or older).
Our findings extend those of our prior study,3 in
which we demonstrated declines in various measures of
physical function with 1 year of ADT, in 2 important
ways. First, we demonstrated that those initial losses in
physical function persisted over an additional 2 years but
did not, in general, worsen further or improve over time.
Second, the exception to this was the TUG test, in which
there were gradual declines that became statistically significant and clinically important only with extended followup. This suggests progressive worsening of lower extremity function over time with ADT, which has not been previously reported. Although several longitudinal studies
have previously demonstrated declines in physical function with ADT use,4-6,26 few have followed patients
beyond 1 to 2 years, and most have employed only selfreported measures of physical function. Moreover, as we
noted previously,3 changes of similar magnitude in objective physical function tests in other studies of older adults
have been associated with greater disability27 or mortality.9 For example, with each 5-kg reduction in grip

This table shows the percentage of individuals in each cohort who
improved, remained stable, or declined by at least the minimum clinically
important difference on a given scale between the baseline and 36-month
follow-up. The minimum clinically important differences were 140 feet for
the 6MWT, 4.5 kg for the grip strength, 1 second for the TUG test, 5 points
for the SF-36 PCS and MCS, 5 points for the Barthel index, 1 point for the

strength over 4 years, there was a 24% increased mortality
risk, and with each 5% loss of relative grip strength, there
was a 6% increased mortality risk in a cohort of older
adults.9 In the present study, ADT users lost approximately 5% of their grip strength over 12 months and did
not regain it over the subsequent 24 months.
A reasonable interpretation of our findings is that
most of the deleterious effects of ADT on physical function in middle-aged and older men is seen with 6
months of ADT use. An additional 12 to 30 months of
ADT does not appear to lead to much additional decline

other than perhaps some worsening of lower extremity
functioning. This may be particularly relevant to clinicians who are debating the merits of shorter and longer
courses of ADT because it provides more information
about physical toxicities of ADT. However, it would be
important to confirm these findings in a larger cohort,
which would also allow more detailed age-specific
analyses.
Although our findings using mixed effects models
were generally confirmed with categorical analysis based
on the MCID, an exception was the 6MWT, which was
shown to be different between ADT users and controls
in the mixed effects models (P 5 .003), but this was not
confirmed with the MCID analysis (P 5 .37). The latter
is likely due to a loss of power with the latter analysis,
which used a 3-category variable versus a continuous
variable.
We were unable to demonstrate consistent excess
vulnerability to the physical effects of ADT in older subjects versus younger subjects, even though there is a large
body of literature demonstrating that older age is associated with reduced ability to withstand stress or recover
from injury.28,29 It may be that the effects of ADT are
seen consistently across the age range of patients enrolled
in our study (generally in their 60s and 70s). However, despite our attempts to recruit equal numbers across our 3
age groups, the majority were 65 to 74 years old; thus, our
study may have had limited power to detect differential
effects by age group.
The present study has several limitations. First, most
of our subjects were well educated and highly functional
at the baseline. Whether deleterious effects of ADT might
be worse in men with lower baseline levels of function (ie,
more frail) is uncertain. An additional limitation is the
lack of documentation of routine physical activity, which
might be expected to moderate the effects of ADT on
physical function.10 We did not adjust for multiple significance testing. As such, our findings for secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses should be viewed as
exploratory and hypothesis-generating. It is also important to recognize that our findings apply to men with PC
on ADT whose disease remains stable because men who
progressed or died were censored. We also recognize a significant loss to follow-up, primarily at the time of consenting to the follow-up study. Men remaining in the
study were relatively well matched on sociodemographic
characteristics, and a loss to follow-up of 5% per visit is
typical of longitudinal studies. In addition, the mixed
effects models allowed us to include partial data for
patients who dropped out or withdrew, and we performed

a sensitivity analysis with imputation of missing data,
which confirmed our main findings for our primary outcomes. Nevertheless, these approaches cannot completely account for the effects of attrition. Finally,
patients on ADT had worse tumor characteristics and
were treated more often with radiation than PC controls.
Even though we matched and obtained similar baseline
QOL and physical function among cohorts, we could
not completely control for some of these factors in our
analyses.
Finally, there has been a shift toward using intermittent ADT instead of continuous ADT for a number of
men with PC and particularly for those with biochemical
relapse. Although intermittent ADT has been associated
with improvements in sexual function, QOL, and fatigue
during the off periods,30 whether this is associated with recovery in physical function is not clear and requires additional study.
In conclusion, 3 years of ADT use is associated with
persistent, clinically relevant declines in both objective
and self-reported physical function that are independent
of age. Most declines stabilize but do not improve beyond
the first 6 months of use; however, lower extremity function continues to worsen over time. These results will help
clinicians and patients to better understand the risks of
ADT. Moreover, they reinforce the need for greater adoption of exercise programs among ADT users, regardless of
whether they are new or established users, to reverse or
prevent these declines.10
