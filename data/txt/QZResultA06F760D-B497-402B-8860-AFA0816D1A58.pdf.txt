Abstract
Regulation of the balance between survival, proliferation, and
apoptosis on carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) exposure is still poorly understood and more particularly the role of physiologic variables, including intracellular
pH (pHi). Although the involvement of the ubiquitous pHi
regulator Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) in tumorigenesis is well documented, less is known about its role and
regulation during apoptosis. Our previous works have shown
the primordial role of NHE1 in carcinogenic PAH-induced
apoptosis. This alkalinizing transporter was activated by an
early CYP1-dependent H2O2 production, subsequently promoting mitochondrial dysfunction leading to apoptosis. The
aim of this study was to further elucidate how NHE1 was
activated by benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and what the downstream
events were in the context of apoptosis. Our results indicate
that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (MKK4/JNK) pathway was a link between
BaP-induced H2O2 production and NHE1 activation. This
activation, in combination with BaP-induced phosphorylated
p53, promoted mitochondrial superoxide anion production,
supporting the existence of a common target for NHE1 and
p53. Furthermore, we showed that the mitochondrial expression of glycolytic enzyme hexokinase II (HKII) was decreased
following a combined action of NHE1 and p53 pathways,
thereby enhancing the BaP-induced apoptosis. Taken together,
our findings suggest that, on BaP exposure, MKK4/JNK targets
NHE1 with consequences on HKII protein, which might thus
be a key protein during carcinogenic PAH apoptosis. [Cancer

Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are widely spread
pollutants to which humans are commonly exposed. Many of
these compounds exhibit carcinogenic effects due to their
metabolism by cytochromes P450, thereby forming highly reactive
metabolites that bind to DNA (1). This genotoxicity is also the
major trigger of apoptotic induction in several cellular models (2).

However, recent works showed that PAH can lead to deleterious
effects apparently following DNA damage–independent processes
(3, 4) and that proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals often occur
simultaneously (5). In this context, it seems important to further
elucidate which physiologic variables influence the balance
between survival and death.
In our previous works, we focused on intracellular H+ homeostasis following PAH treatment. Indeed, intracellular pH (pHi) is a
highly regulated cellular variable, whose perturbations by activation or inhibition of transporters or by metabolic changes induce
proliferative, differentiation, or apoptotic signals (6). About the
balance between survival and death, acidification has been
considered as a proapoptotic signal, whereas alkalinization has
commonly been associated with proliferative situations (7).
Whereas intracellular acidification is well documented, apoptosisrelated alkalinization has thus far been the subject of only a few
investigations, although its emerging involvement as an early event
in the apoptotic cascade could make it a crucial target for cancer
therapy or for prevention against chemically induced toxicity (8, 9).
The origin of intracellular alkalinization seems to be mainly
attributed to the activation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1),
as observed on cytokine deprivation or potassium antimonyl
tartrate exposure (see ref. 10 for review), and often found to be
transient followed or not by an acidification. This biphasic pHi
variation is involved in PAH-induced apoptosis in F258 rat liver
epithelial cells (3).
We have previously shown that toxic PAHs activate the
ubiquitous NHE1 following CYP metabolism and H2O2 production.
The induced H+ efflux leads to an early but transient alkalinization,
which is followed by a late acidification depending on a mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase reversal (11). The use of cariporide, a specific
NHE1 inhibitor, blocks both alkalinization and acidification and
allows partial prevention of PAH-related apoptosis. These studies
underlined the importance of NHE1 activation for the control of
mitochondrial homeostasis during PAH-induced cell death. Moreover, we showed that F0F1-ATPase reversal, leading to acidification,
promotes recruitment of multiple apoptotic effectors. Thus, these
results strengthen the idea that disturbance of energetic metabolism can modulate pHi and consequently apoptosis.
The present study focuses on the activation of NHE1 by
considering two aspects: how NHE1 is activated in PAH-induced
apoptosis and what its implications are in this process. Indeed, this
transporter has been associated with tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance (7, 12). Moreover, it has been shown that a highly
carcinogenic PAH, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), induced NHE1 expression
in HepG2 tumoral cells (13). At this stage, it was important to
identify the stimuli involved in NHE1 activation during the

Role for NHE1 in Hexokinase II Expression Control

apoptotic process elicited by PAH. Finally, activation of NHE1
might seem as a new pathway for modulating cellular response to
an apoptotic stimulus. Few targets for this increase of pHi have
been identified thus far, among which Bax whose conformation
changes on alkalinization, thus allowing its mitochondrial translocation (14, 15). However, in our experimental system, Bax did not
seem to be involved (11). The sensitivity of metabolic enzymes for
pHi changes has also been described previously (16); in this context,
although it was neglected in the past, the energy metabolism may
play a primordial role in various transduction pathways, including
those leading to cell death (17). About that point, it is worth noting
that recent works have suggested that hexokinase II (HKII), a key
glycolytic enzyme bound to mitochondria, would be an important
regulator of apoptotic processes (18, 19).
Our data provide evidence that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK),
activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4
(MKK4) following its stimulation by BaP-induced H2O2 production,
triggers NHE1 activation. The consecutive alkalinization may
modify the activity of the mitochondrial complex III, leading to
superoxide anion production. About p53, we showed that its
activation and translocation on one hand, and NHE1 activation on
the other hand, occur independently to each other. However, the
fact that inhibiting p53 prevents mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production points out the existence of a common
mitochondrial target for NHE1 activation and p53 pathway. By
using glucose derivative and small interfering RNA (siRNA), we
found that HKII might be the ‘‘pivot protein’’ between NHE1 and
p53 pathways during PAH-induced apoptosis.

Results
BaP-induced NHE1 activation relies on a H2O2-dependent
MKK4/JNK pathway. Experiments were first done to identify the
intermediate signals between H2O2 and NHE1. Several reports
suggested that MAPK could be involved in NHE1 activation elicited
by exogenous H2O2 in cardiac cells (21). One of the stress-related
MAPKs, JNK, is activated by BaP (22). In Fig. 1A, immunoblotting
and immunolocalization of phosphorylated JNK (Thr183 and Tyr185)
revealed an increase of JNK phosphorylation, with a nuclear
accumulation of this protein following a 24-h treatment of F258
cells with 50 nmol/L BaP. This state of phosphorylation was
maintained after 48 h but decreased after 72 h of BaP exposure.
JNK activation was associated with phosphorylation of its major
substrate, c-Jun, as detected by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Moreover,
c-Jun activation was also detected by gene reporter transfection
and luciferase activity measurements as soon as 24 h of treatment
with 50 nmol/L BaP (Supplementary Fig. S1). The use of the JNKi
(1 Amol/L), as well as thiourea [10 mmol/L; to block H2O2
production (3)], prevented both JNK phosphorylation and translocation as well as c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 1A).
MKK4 is known to directly activate JNK in a context of ROSdependent apoptosis (23). We therefore tested its possible
involvement upstream JNK activation on BaP exposure. Western
blot analysis in Fig. 1A revealed the same phosphorylation pattern
as for JNK, with a peak at 24 h of treatment. We further found that
MKK4 phosphorylation was sensitive to thiourea pretreatment and,
as expected, insensitive to JNKi. To firmly confirm the role of
MKK4, we next did experiments using siRNA against MKK4
(Si MKK4) or RNA-negative control (Si Neg). As shown in Fig. 1A,
MKK4 expression was markedly reduced in Si MKK4–transfected
cells compared with Si Neg–transfected cells; most interestingly,
this down-regulation consequently abrogated JNK phosphorylation,
pointing to MKK4 as the major activator of JNK following BaPinduced H2O2 production.
In an attempt to elucidate the role of JNK in BaP-induced
apoptosis, we also examined the putative protective effect of JNKi
and Si MKK4 on BaP toxicity in F258 cells. By estimating the
number of apoptotic nuclei using Hoechst 33342 staining and the
sub-G1 population (Fig. 1B and C), apoptosis was found to be
decreased by f40% on JNKi cotreatment; likewise, Si MKK4
decreased the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the
caspase-3 activity measured on BaP treatment was found to be

similarly reduced by the presence of JNKi or in Si MKK4–transfected
cells compared with vehicle or Si Neg–transfected cells, respectively.
Because NHE1, involved in BaP-induced apoptosis, was also
activated by H2O2, we examined the potential role of JNK as an
intermediate between the observed NHE1 activation and early ROS
production. We thus assessed the effect of JNKi on NHE1dependent alkalinization by measuring resting pHi in F258 cells
treated with 50 nmol/L BaP and 1 Amol/L JNKi. Figure 2A shows
that BaP-induced alkalinization was prevented by JNKi, thus
suggesting a role for JNK in NHE1 up-regulation following BaP
treatment. To confirm this hypothesis, we next measured the rate
of pHi recovery following an acid load induced by an NH+4 prepulse
in F258 cells treated with 50 nmol/L BaP in the presence or
absence of JNKi. As expected from our previous work, the rate of
pHi recovery was markedly increased after a 48-h exposure to 50
nmol/L BaP due to NHE1 activation, and JNKi seemed to prevent
this phenomenon (Fig. 2A). Estimations of the mean H+ equivalent
efflux, JHe (dpHi / dt  b i) were as follows: in the absence of JNKi:
control, 0.76 F 0.06 versus BaP, 1.48 F 0.36 mequiv/L/min; in the
presence of JNKi: control, 0.99 F 0.20 versus BaP, 1.06 F 0.08

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

mequiv/L/min (n = 5). These results clearly show an inhibition of
the increase in NHE1-related acid extrusion by JNKi at 48 h.
Because JNK phosphorylation was dependent on MKK4 activation,
we also tested Si MKK4 on resting pHi. As shown in Fig. 2B, the
alkalinization elicited by BaP in Si Neg–transfected cells did not
occur in Si MKK4–transfected cells. Altogether, these data
indicated that JNK, following MKK4 activation by ROS production,
was necessary for NHE1 activation following BaP treatment.
BaP-induced p53 phosphorylation is not involved in NHE1
activation. BaP is a powerful carcinogen, and DNA damage and
oxidative stress are often related to p53 activation. We have
previously shown that p53 is phosphorylated on Ser15 following a
24-h treatment with 50 nmol/L BaP and then translocated into the
nucleus at 48 h (11). To examine whether p53 activation could play
a role in NHE1 activation, we used PFT that was previously shown
to prevent phosphorylated p53 translocation (11, 20). Resting pHi
was then measured in F258 cells treated with both 50 nmol/L BaP
and 5 Amol/L PFT for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, alkalinization still
occurred under such conditions. Moreover, the use of siRNA
directed against p53 (Si p53) confirmed this result because

Role for NHE1 in Hexokinase II Expression Control

alkalinization was still detected in Si p53–transfected cells
compared with cells transfected with the Si Neg (Fig. 2C), whereas
p53 expression and phosphorylation were blocked under these
conditions (Fig. 2C). These data therefore showed that p53 was not
involved in the signaling pathway between H2O2 production and
NHE1 activation observed on BaP.
NHE1 activation does not modify BaP-induced p53 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. To determine the targets
of NHE1 activation in BaP-induced apoptosis, we next tested RNA
interference against NHE1 (Si NHE1) or the NHE1-specific inhibitor
cariporide on p53 activation. In Fig. 3A, Si NHE1 efficiency was
controlled both at its mRNA expression level [by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)] and at its functional level (by measuring pHi by
microspectrofluorimetry after an acid load). Our data clearly showed
a marked decrease of NHE1 mRNA expression, in the presence or
absence of BaP, in Si NHE1–transfected cells compared with Si Neg–
transfected counterparts; moreover, NHE1-dependent acid extrusion was completely prevented, in these cells, similarly to what was
already observed in the presence of cariporide (3). Besides, after a
48-h treatment with 5 Amol/L BaP, estimation of apoptosis by
Hoechst staining and caspase activity measurements revealed a
decrease of cell death in Si NHE1–transfected cells; for comparison,
data obtained from Si p53–transfected cells have also been plotted.
In Fig. 3B, Western blot analysis showed that cariporide (30 Amol/L)
did not prevent Ser15-p53 phosphorylation following a 48-h treatment whatever the concentration of BaP tested (50 nmol/L and
5 Amol/L). Furthermore, immunolocalizations revealed that phosphorylated p53 translocation was still maintained in the presence of
cariporide (Fig. 3B). Finally, p53 phosphorylation pattern was not
modified by Si NHE1 transfection compared with Si Neg, thus
confirming results obtained with cariporide. Therefore, NHE1

activation and/or alkalinization do not seem to play any role in
either activation or nuclear translocation of p53.
NHE1 activation seems to be involved in mitochondrial ROS
production. We have previously shown that cariporide inhibited
not only the early BaP-induced alkalinization but also the
subsequent mitochondria-dependent acidification (3). Thus,
NHE1 activation seems to play a role in mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, BaP and other PAHs have been reported to induce
mitochondria-related ROS production during carcinogenesis and
apoptosis (24, 25). We therefore decided to examine ROS production following treatment of F258 cells with BaP (50 nmol/L) for
48 h by using the superoxide anion–specific probe DHE and by flow
cytometry analysis. In Fig. 3C, the shift of the peak observed on BaP
treatment revealed an O2 production following 48 h of treatment,
which was dependent on CYP metabolism since inhibited by a CYP
inhibitor, a-NF (data not shown). The addition of JNKi and
cariporide fully blocked this O2 production. Thus, regardless of
whether NHE1 was inhibited by cariporide or JNKi, ROS production
was prevented. Moreover, to test the involvement of the p53
pathway in this ROS production, we finally tested the effect of
PFT. Like cariporide, this compound prevented the O2 generation
(Fig. 3C). All these results obtained with chemical inhibitors were
confirmed by using Si NHE1–transfected or Si p53–transfected
cells. Indeed, the shift of the DHE fluorescent peak observed when
exposing Si Neg–transfected cells to 500 nmol/L BaP for 48 h was
markedly inhibited when Si NHE1–transfected or Si p53–transfected cells were tested. Therefore, whereas activation of NHE1 and
p53 seems to occur independently following BaP treatment, both
pathways would modulate ROS production.
To determine the involvement of ROS in the apoptotic cascade,
we first assessed the effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine

alkalinization in contrast to p53. A, F258 cells were treated

(NAC) on BaP-induced apoptosis. Experiments of Hoechst 33342
staining, caspase activity measurement, and sub-G1 population
analysis (Fig. 4A–C) revealed that NAC was capable of reducing
BaP toxicity by f50%. This protection was related to the inhibition
of O2 production (Fig. 4D). The mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP
also blocked BaP-induced O2 production (Fig. 4D), indicating that
such an event was dependent on the mitochondria. Moreover, as
antimycin A (25 Amol/L), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial
complex III, prevented BaP-induced ROS production (Fig. 4D), this
complex was supposed to be involved in this effect. It is worth
noting that antimycin A was previously shown to reduce BaPinduced cell death (11). On the whole, our data indicated that
NHE1 and p53 activation promoted apoptosis by leading to a
mitochondrial dysfunction and O2 generation.
Our previous works showed an important mitochondrial
dysfunction, with a hyperpolarization (26) and the reversal of the
F0F1-ATPase (11). The presently detected mitochondrial ROS
production further underlines the fact that BaP exposure disrupts
mitochondrial homeostasis. However, the absence of depolarization

and cytochrome c release in our cell model led us to consider the
possibility that mitochondrial alterations might stem from changes
in the energy metabolism (27). Accordingly, we tested a glucose
derivative, the 5ThioG, shown to inhibit HKII (27). This enzyme has
been shown to interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel
(VDAC) and to regulate mitochondrial ROS production (28) as well
as apoptosis (17). To maintain ATP supply, pyruvate (110 mg/L) was
added, without any effect on BaP-induced apoptosis rate (Fig. 4A
and B). As shown in Fig. 4A–C, cotreatment with BaP and 5ThioG
(5 mmol/L) resulted in the reduction of both nuclear fragmentation
and caspase activity (by about a factor of 3.5). Moreover, cotreatment
with 5ThioG strongly inhibited ROS production (Fig. 4D). Altogether,
these results suggested that glycolysis and, more particularly, the
glycolytic enzyme HKII might be a potential target for BaP.
HKII is an apoptotic target for BaP-induced NHE1 activation. To gain further insight into the possible role of HKII during
BaP-induced apoptosis, siRNA directed against HKII (Si HKII B66
and Si HKII B67) was tested; its efficiency was first confirmed in
Fig. 5A. After 72 h of treatment with BaP, we observed a

potentialization of BaP-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A) by f93.7% for
Si HKII B67. Moreover, similar results were obtained by using
a HKII VDAC binding domain peptide (HKII-VDAC; 20 Amol/L)
after Hoechst staining. This cell-permeant peptide acts as a competitor with HKII for its binding to VDAC. After a 72-h cotreatment
with BaP and HKII-VDAC, the percentage of apoptotic cells
was increased by 2.0 F 0.6–fold (n = 3) compared with BaP alone
(data not shown). In conclusion, changing HKII expression or
displacing it from the VDAC amplified the toxic effect of BaP.
These results further emphasized the observation that HKII might
be important for toxicity of BaP in our cell model.
The next set of experiments was therefore done to test the
effect of BaP on HKII expression. Western blotting on total lysates
prepared from BaP-treated (50 nmol/L) cells for 24, 48, and 72
h showed that BaP markedly decreased total HKII expression at
48 and 72 h (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because the energy control
by HKII is directly dependent on its binding to mitochondria, we
next focused on mitochondrial HKII expression. In Fig. 5B, after a
48-h treatment with 50 nmol/L BaP, immunolocalization experiments indicated that HKII (green) was translocated from the
mitochondria to the cytosol, as visualized by the loss of
costaining of HKII with MitoTracker (red), a specific mitochondrial fluoroprobe. Such an effect was further confirmed by the
decrease in the mitochondrial expression of HKII as evidenced by
Western blotting on mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 5C). This
decrease was prevented by the P-450 inhibitor a-NF, as well as
by PFT or Si p53, to prevent p53 activation; this therefore
suggested that p53 could be involved in HKII localization
regulation (Fig. 5C). p53 involvement was further confirmed by
HKII immunostaining in Si p53–transfected cells; indeed, as
shown in Fig. 5B, HKII was maintained at the mitochondrial level

www.aacrjournals.org

in the presence of BaP, whereas it was translocated in Si Neg–
transfected cells on BaP. To evaluate any possible role for NHE1
in the process, the effects of cariporide and Si NHE1 were next
tested; our data indicated that cariporide as well as Si NHE1
blocked the decrease in the expression level of HKII at the
mitochondria following BaP exposure (Fig. 5C) and that Si NHE1
prevented HKII translocation (Fig. 5B). 5ThioG, which inhibited
BaP-induced apoptosis, also prevented the decrease of mitochondrial HKII expression (Fig. 5C). pHi measurement after a 48-h
treatment proved that 5ThioG inhibited ROS production and HKII
translocation without any effect on NHE1 activation because the
alkalinizing effect of BaP was maintained [(BaP treated control
cells) in pyruvate-treated cells: DpHi = +0.11 F 0.04; in pyruvate +
5ThioG: DpHi = +0.12 F 0.07; n = 9].
Whereas p53 consensus sequences have been found in HKII
promoter (29), how NHE1 could act on HKII expression has not yet
been examined. By doing RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 5D), we found
that BaP (50 nmol/L, 48 h) induced a down-regulation of HKII
mRNA, which could be prevented by cariporide. Moreover, in Si
p53–transfected and Si NHE1–transfected cells, HKII expression
was not decreased on BaP exposure (5 Amol/L, 48 h), whereas such
a decrease occurred in Si Neg–transfected cells. Taken together,
these results suggested that BaP reduced total HKII protein levels
by inhibiting HKII mRNA expression through a process involving
both p53 and NHE1 activation and/or alkalinization.

Discussion
Our previous works showed the prominent role of NHE1 and pHi
during genotoxic PAH-induced apoptosis (3). The aim of the
present study was to elucidate (a) how H2O2 production related to

PAH metabolism could activate NHE1 exchange and (b) which
apoptotic events were sensitive to NHE1 activation. Our results
show for the first time that the MKK4/JNK pathway is capable of
activating NHE1 during BaP-related apoptosis. Moreover, NHE1
activation plays an essential role in mitochondrial superoxide

generation, which originates from the complex III. More precisely,
its activation triggers a decrease of the mitochondrial HKII
expression, leading to the uncoupling of the mitochondrial energy
metabolism and ROS production. Finally, whereas p53 and NHE1
activations seem as two independent phenomena in early

Role for NHE1 in Hexokinase II Expression Control

Figure 6. Schematic summary of the origin and role of
NHE1 activation in BaP-induced apoptosis. BaP, a
lipophilic molecule, goes across the bilayer membrane. In
the cytosol, BaP is metabolized by CYP1 into reactive
metabolites, which form DNA adducts, leading to p53
activation. The CYP1-dependent metabolism leads to an
early production of H2O2, which activates NHE1 via MKK4/
JNK recruitment. Both NHE1 and p53 pathways would
target HKII present in mitochondria, leading to the
production of O2 by the complex III. These mitochondrial
dysfunctions would promote late apoptotic events, such as
acidification and caspase activation. Caspase-independent
processes, shown to be triggered by p53, would also
occur depending or not on acidification (11).

PAH-elicited biological effects, our data suggest possible cross-talks
at the mitochondrial level, which might explain the similar effects
of NHE1 and p53 inhibitions on mitochondria-dependent events
elicited on BaP application [i.e., cytosolic acidification and ROS
production (Fig. 6)].
JNK activation induced by PAH has been previously described
during allergic inflammation (30), apoptosis (31), and tumor
promotion (32) and is in general related to the occurrence of
oxidative stress (30). Our present results revealed that JNK was
phosphorylated (Thr183 and Tyr185) and translocated into the
nucleus following the previously detected H2O2 production
induced by a 24-h treatment with BaP (3). We further found that
JNK phosphorylation was dependent on MKK4 activation by H2O2.
When testing a role for MKK4/JNK in BaP-induced NHE1
activation (by using JNKi or Si MKK4), we observed that NHE1
recruitment was inhibited by both Si MKK4 and JNKi. Moreover,
in accordance with the contribution of NHE1 to BaP-induced
apoptosis, JNKi and Si MKK4 prevented BaP toxicity to about the
same extent as for the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide. The fact

www.aacrjournals.org

that the effects of Si NHE1 on apoptosis were larger than Si MKK4
or JNKi might suggest that reducing NHE1 expression would alter
functions of the protein other than only ion translocation (33).
Taken together, our results strongly point to MKK4/JNK pathway
as the signaling link between H2O2 generation and NHE1
activation during CYP-dependent metabolism of BaP. At this
stage, one major concern remains to be resolved: how can
phosphorylated JNK act on NHE1 activity? Indeed, no binding or
phosphorylation site for JNK has been thus far identified on the
COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 (33). Actually, it
might be possible that, under our experimental conditions, JNK
would be acting on the serine/threonine kinase p90RSK to
phosphorylate and hence activate NHE1 (34) because p90RSK has
also been shown to be a substrate of JNK2 on UVA exposure (35),
a situation known to produce ROS (36). However, it is important
to note that the modalities of NHE1 activation during apoptosis
still remain poorly described and it might be possible that this
new NHE1 regulation via JNK would be the signature of a
proapoptotic signal.

Cancer Research

Our previous work suggested that the role of NHE1 activation in
BaP-induced apoptosis was linked to mitochondria because
cariporide prevented mitochondria-dependent acidification, whose
origin seemed to be the reverse activity of F0F1-ATPase (3, 11).
Moreover, the mitochondria-related acidification also requires p53
activation. To gain further insight into the signaling pathways
elicited by BaP, we first sought whether p53 could also participate
to NHE1 activation, thereby acting on mitochondria. This aspect
was important to test because p53 has previously been shown
to regulate the expression of various transporters and channels
(37, 38). However, both the p53 inhibitor PFT and Si p53 were
ineffective on BaP-induced alkalinization, indicating a p53independent NHE1 regulation. Inversely, an effect of NHE1
targeting by BaP on p53 activation could have occurred, as acidosis
has been shown to induce p53 accumulation, thereby eliciting
apoptosis (39). This was clearly not the case here because no
variation in the pattern of p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and
nuclear translocation was detected in the presence of cariporide or
in Si NHE1–transfected cells.
Although NHE1 and p53 activations seemed as two independent
events upstream mitochondria, they seemed to ultimately converge
to these organelles. We then suspected that mitochondrial
targeting might be associated with ROS production. Our experiments based on the use of various ROS-sensitive probes showed
that a 48-h treatment with 50 nmol/L BaP resulted in a production
of superoxide anion O2 related to the metabolism of this PAH.
However, unlike H2O2 production detected following 24 h of
treatment, BaP-induced O2 production was also inhibited by FCCP,
an uncoupler of mitochondrial activity, thus pointing to the
mitochondrial origin of the superoxide generation. Most interestingly, when JNK or NHE1 was inhibited, BaP did not induce any
ROS production. Therefore, NHE1 activation and/or resulting
alkalinization seemed to act on mitochondrion by increasing ROS
production. To identify which mitochondrial electron transport
chain (ETC) complexes were involved, several specific inhibitors
were used. Among them, antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III
(ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase; ref. 40), strongly decreased BaP-induced ROS production, supporting the idea of a
major role for complex III in this ROS generation. Moreover, the
similar pattern of inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production
obtained on cotreatment with BaP and cariporide or PFT and
confirmed by using Si NHE1–transfected or Si p53–transfected
cells, respectively, showed a convergence of both NHE1 and p53
pathways. These results clearly point to the involvement of NHE1
and p53 in the deregulation of the complex III, especially in
situations where a dysfunction of the F0F1-ATPase activity occurs,
which leads to a backup in ETC (40). Consequently, in a context in
which cytochrome c release was not involved (11), one might
suppose that all mitochondrial energy metabolism should be
altered.
1HKII is a mitochondria-bound glycolytic enzyme that
mediates the phosphorylation of glucose and couples intramitochondrial ATP synthesis to glucose metabolism. It favors
aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, and maintenance of a low ROS
rate (41). Besides, this enzyme is overexpressed in highly
malignant tumors (42). Moreover, a link between glucose supply
and the control of apoptosis has been established (17, 18). Finally,
its role in the antioxidant defense was shown in a recent work
(28). The use of 5ThioG as a glycolysis and HKII inhibitor allowed
us to show that HKII was involved in BaP-induced O2 production.
Moreover, the decrease of HKII expression (by Si HKII) or the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

disruption of its binding (by using the HKII-VDAC competitor
peptide) potentiated BaP-induced apoptosis, whereas maintaining
its mitochondrial localization (by 5ThioG) prevented such a
toxicity. Similar results have already been identified for apoptosis
elicited by growth factor depletion or DNA damage (27, 43),
situations also known to be associated with alkalinization (10).
The mechanisms underlying disruption of the mitochondrial
binding of the HKII on BaP remain to be discovered and might
involve a down-regulation of its expression (43), an accumulation
of glucose-6-phosphate (44), a protein that enters into competition with VDAC (44, 45), or an involvement of Akt and glycogen
synthase kinase 3h (19, 27, 46). About the former aspect, downregulation of HKII expression would be triggered because
reduction of HKII mRNA was observed following BaP treatment
and reversed by p53 and NHE1 silencing. The fact that p53 would
be capable of regulating HKII promoter (29) is an important point
to consider for future experiments in the light of the convergence
of p53 and NHE1 pathways. For example, one might suppose the
p53 binding on HKII promoter to be modulated by a NHE1sensitive regulator or signaling pathway, which remains to be
determined. Another important concern to resolve in the future is
related to the importance of the NHE1 pathway relatively to the
DNA damage–triggered p53 pathway, although, based on our
results obtained by using Si NHE1 and Si p53, it seems that, in
our cell model, both pathways would be as important; however, as
described above, decreasing NHE1 expression may alter different
transporter-related functions not necessarily involved in BaP
effects. In this context, this open question should be tackled by
other means, notably by using DNA repair–deficient cells (e.g.,
cells in which nucleotide excision repair pathway is hampered;
see ref. 47 for review).
The present study shows for the first time that BaP can
interfere with mitochondrial HKII expression and promote
apoptosis. However, very early works by Adachi et al. (48)
suggested that PAH would favor tumor growth by increasing
hexokinase activities, a phenomenon that would be primordial for
the initiation and promotion of cancers (49). Thus, hexokinase
might constitute a major protein in controlling the balance of
proliferation and apoptosis following PAH exposure and hence
related cancer development.
Finally, we have found a new network of pathways in which
NHE1, well known for its involvement in tumor progression, has
been identified as activated by PAHs via MKK4/JNK in an apoptotic
context. It would then affect HKII expression, acting as a
proapoptotic actor following genotoxic agent exposure. The
present work represents an important step forward in the
understanding of the mechanism involved in the regulation of
the balance between proliferation and apoptosis following DNA
damage, in which both NHE1 and PAH exhibit an ambivalent
action on cell survival versus death pathways.
