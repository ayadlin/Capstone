BACKGROUND: The relationship between quantitative immunohistochemical hormone receptor expression and
response to the combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer is currently unknown. METHODS: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression was studied both as a dichotomous variable (positivity set at 1% of positive cells) and as a continuous variable. The effect of hormone
receptor expression on overall response rate and progression-free survival in patients receiving trastuzumab-based
treatment was studied by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 227 consecutive
advanced breast cancer patients treated at 2 Institutions had hormone receptor-positive tumors (49%). High expression of ER (30% of tumor cells) predicted reduced probability of tumor response to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (multivariate odds ratio, 0.422; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.222-0.803; P ¼ .009). In patients with hormone
receptor-positive tumors (1% of tumor cells), maintenance endocrine therapy added to trastuzumab upon the completion of chemotherapy was associated with a significant progression-free survival benefit (hazard ratio, 0.521; 95%
CI, 0.3325-0.836; P ¼ .007). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a predictive role of hormone receptor expression in
HER2-positive tumors. Further investigation in this patient subset is warranted to optimize the use of HER2-targeting

KEYWORDS: breast neoplasms, HER2, estrogen receptor, trastuzumab, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy.

Estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are key biological factors in breast
cancer. ER activation induces the expression of the progesterone receptor (PGR) and of a series of genes involved in breast
cancer development and progression.1 About 2=3 of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive, based on the immunohistochemical expression of either ER, PGR, or both receptors.2 In general, hormone receptor positivity is considered both a
favorable prognostic factor and a predictor of the efficacy of endocrine therapy.3
Overexpression and/or amplification of the HER2 receptor occurs in some 15% to 20% of breast cancers in women
and denotes a biologically aggressive subset of this disease.4 HER2 positivity is frequently associated with higher histopathological grade, reduced hormone receptor expression, and propensity to metastasize to viscera and to the central nervous
system.4-7 Coexpression of HER2 in hormone receptor-positive tumors is associated with reduced efficacy of endocrine
therapy.8-10 One of the most credited mechanisms that have been proposed to explain endocrine resistance is cross-talk
between the ER and HER family pathways.11-13 Hyperactive HER2 or epidermal growth factor receptor can activate the
ER directly, in the absence of its natural ligand. This explains not only resistance to selective estrogen receptor down-modulators, but also to aromatase inhibitors.14

One pivotal phase 3 trial and 1 randomized phase 2
trial demonstrated that the addition of trastuzumab, a
therapeutic anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, to chemotherapy boosted response rate, progression-free survival
(PFS), and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy
alone, in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast
cancer.15,16 About a half of the patients enrolled in the
pivotal trial had coexpression of HER2 and hormone receptor.15 A retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in
this trial suggested that the addition of trastuzumab to
chemotherapy yielded equal benefits in hormone receptor
negative and positive tumors.17 These results added further strength to the paradigm that HER2-positive tumors,
because of reduced endocrine-responsiveness, need to be
treated with a unified approach of combining chemotherapy with HER2 targeting, regardless of hormone receptor
status. One of the main limitations of that analysis was
that hormone receptor status was defined as either positive
or negative based on the results of local laboratories.
Therefore, the potential heterogeneity in clinical behavior
according to the degree of hormone receptor expression
could not be accounted for.
Gene expression profile studies indicate that HER2positive/hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive/
hormone receptor-negative tumors fall into 2 distinct subtypes.18 These 2 subtypes carry a different prognosis in the
absence of HER2 targeting.19 Furthermore, a relationship
has been documented between increasing hormone receptor expression and reduced chemoresponsiveness.20,21
On these premises, we set out to investigate clinical
outcomes of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients
with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer according to
the extent of hormone receptor positivity. The finding of
a different clinical outcome related to level of hormone receptor expression might provide a rationale for further
studies on the role of endocrine therapy in the treatment
of this subset of HER2-positive tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were selected from a multi-institutional database
containing the clinical data of women with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving trastuzumab-based therapy for
metastatic disease and treated at 11 different Institutions
in Italy, United Kingdom, and Hungary. For this analysis
we considered only patients treated at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, and at the Institute for
Cancer Research and Treatment in Candiolo, Italy. For

18

all consecutive patients who received at least 1 infusion of
trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, we collected clinical and pathological
characteristics, prior treatments for breast cancer, and
details of the first trastuzumab-based treatment (drugs
and doses, date of progression, and date of death or of last
follow-up visit).
HER2 and Hormone-Receptor Assessment
All patients had their specimens reviewed for HER2, ER,
and PGR at either 1 of the 2 institutions participating in
this study. Whenever possible, assessments were performed on the most recent tumor material, whether it be
the primary tumor or a biopsy of metastatic disease.
HER2 status was reassessed according to recently published guidelines.22 Positivity was defined as 3þ score by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in >30% of invasive tumor cells using the HercepTest (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Equivocal cases at IHC (2þ score or 3þ in 30%
of invasive tumor cells) were submitted to fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. A ratio of HER2 gene
signals to chromosome 17 signals of >2.2 was used as a
cutoff to define HER2-gene amplification. The assessment of hormone receptor status was carried out by IHC
using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to ER (Dako, at
1:100 dilution), and the MoAb to PGR (Dako, 1:800
dilution). Only nuclear reactivity was taken into account
for ER and PGR. Positivity was defined as immunostaining in 1% of invasive tumor cells.
Statistical Methods
Tumor response was analyzed in patients with measurable
disease and reported according to World Health Organization criteria.23 Response rate was defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR) or
partial remission (PR). For each patient, tumor response
was usually planned to be performed every 2 to 3 months
during the first year of treatment and every 6 months
from the second year onward. For the scope of this analysis, each patient’s imaging was reviewed.
PFS was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method for
all patients from the date of the first administration of
trastuzumab to the date of tumor progression or death.
Living patients were censored at the date of the last follow-up contact.
ER and PGR status was studied both as a dichotomous (positive vs negative) and as a continuous variable.
Comparisons between patients characteristics were
studied by the chi-square or the Fisher exact test

(dichotomous variables), and by the Mann-Whitney U
test (continuous variables). Survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression and Cox-proportional hazards analysis
models were studied to identify variables that were independently associated with clinical outcomes of interest.
In a first step, we looked for predictors of overall
response rate (ORR) and PFS other than receptor status.
The list of potential predictors of ORR included: median
age at the time of trastuzumab-based therapy, which was
dichotomized around the median value of 53 years; disease-free interval from surgery of primary breast cancer
to metastasis, which was dichotomized around its median
value of 21 months; stage at first diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer (I/II vs III vs IV); receipt of prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy; prior exposure to
anthracycline, taxanes, and endocrine therapy (any setting); liver involvement; visceral involvement (liver þ
lung þ central nervous system); number of prior lines of
chemotherapy for metastatic disease before trastuzumabbased therapy (0 or 1 vs >1); number of sites of metastatic disease (1 or 2 vs >2); and type of chemotherapy
added to trastuzumab (taxane-based vs vinorelbine-based
vs other regimens). The same list of variables plus
response to trastuzumab-based therapy (CR þ PR vs stable disease [SD] or progressive disease) and maintenance
endocrine therapy was used to identify predictors of PFS.
All the variables were entered into the model and then
removed by backward stepwise selection. Only variables
associated with the outcome of interest at a P value
<.05, as determined by the Wald statistic, remained in
the model. In a second step, the effect of each definition
of hormone receptor positivity on ORR and PFS was
individually corrected for the predictors that we identified in the first step. The proportionality of hazards
assumption was checked by the log-minus-log survival
plot method. All the analyses were conducted by the
SPSS 17.0 statistical package (Chicago, Ill).
This study being a retrospective analysis of clinical
outcomes, no specific written informed consent was
required. However, the process of data collection was conducted in compliance with the ethical requirements of
each of the participating institutions.

RESULTS
A total of 227 patients who had their HER2-status confirmed (HER2 3þ or HER2 amplification by FISH analysis) and received their first trastuzumab-based regimen

between June 1999 and November 2008 were eligible for
this analysis. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of
these patients according to hormone receptor status.
None of these patients had received trastuzumab in the
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Apart from exposure to
endocrine therapy before trastuzumab, patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors had a statistically nonsignificant trend toward longer disease-free interval from
the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, more frequent skeletal involvement, and less frequent lung metastases. At the
time of this analysis, a total of 172 patients had progressed
during the initial trastuzumab-based regimen, and 127
patients had died from breast cancer progression. Thirtysix patients in the hormone receptor-positive group
received, upon discontinuation of chemotherapy and in
the absence of disease progression, an endocrine compound together with trastuzumab (maintenance endocrine therapy). Ten of these patients had never received
prior endocrine therapy, and the other 26 had been
exposed to endocrine therapy before trastuzumab. Maintenance endocrine therapy consisted of an aromatase inhibitor in all 36 patients. Three of them, who were
premenopausal before starting trastuzumab-based therapy, received concomitant pharmacological ovarian function suppression.
The overall response rate to the first trastuzumabbased regimen, calculated in 212 patients with measurable
disease, was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56%69%). In all patients, median PFS and median survival
were 13 months (95% CI, 10-16 months) and 40 months
(95% CI, 36-44 months), respectively. The status of ER
and PGR, defined as positive versus negative at a cutoff of
1% stained cells, failed to show any significant impact
on ORR and PFS neither when the 2 receptors were considered individually, nor when analyzed in any other possible combination (not shown). Considering only patients
with hormone receptor-positive tumors, the median percentage of positive cells was 62% (range, 1%-100%) for
ER and 20% (range, 1%-95%) for PGR. When considered as continuous variables, ER expression was significantly associated with reduced response rate (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.990; 95% CI, 0.982-0.998; P ¼ .018), and PGR
expression was significantly associated with reduced risk
of progression (HR, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.984-0.999; P ¼
.026). Plots of odds ratio for response and hormone receptor for PFS by extent of ER and PGR immunoreactivity
suggested a nonlinear relationship between these variables.
To find a cutoff for ER and PGR positivity, we created
multiple dichotomous variables using 10-percentage

response and tumor progression, respectively, as dependent variables. A value of 30% for the ER was the lowest
percentage of positivity that resulted in a statistically significant difference in response rate (Table 2). A difference
of borderline statistical significance was observed for PGR
at a cutoff of 50%, but 15 (88%) of 17 of these tumors
had concomitant ER expression in 30% of tumor cells.

Each OR has been generated by correcting each definition of hormone receptor positivity by liver involvement, number of prior treatments for metastatic disease, and type of chemotherapy associated with trastuzumab.

Multivariate Analysis
Liver involvement, number of prior chemotherapies for
metastatic disease before trastuzumab, and type of chemotherapy associated with trastuzumab were independent
predictors of ORR on multivariate analysis (Table 3). The
effect of each definition of hormone receptor positivity on
ORR was then individually corrected by these predictors
(Table 4). Expression of the ER in 30% of tumor cells
was significantly associated with reduced probability of
response to chemotherapy and trastuzumab.
For PFS, we proceeded in the same way. In a first
step, we found that disease-free interval, prior exposure to
taxanes, visceral involvement, number of sites of metastatic disease, response to trastuzumab-based therapy, and
maintenance endocrine therapy were independently associated with PFS (Table 5). The effect of each definition of
hormone receptor positivity on PFS was then individually
corrected by these predictors (second step, Table 6).
Although trends toward reduced risk of progression were
seen for ER, PGR, or their combined expression at a cutoff of 30% of positive cells, no statistically significant
effect was seen. We hypothesized that maintenance endocrine therapy could have acted as a confounding factor in

this analysis. Therefore, we created 2 new variables combining the use of maintenance endocrine therapy and hormone receptor expression at both the 1% and the 30%
cutoff. Hormone receptor positivity and high hormone
receptor expression were defined as ER and/or PGR positivity in 1% and 30% of invasive tumor cells, respectively. Hormone receptor negativity and low or low/
absent hormone receptor expression were defined as both
ER and PGR positivity in <1% and <30% of invasive tumor cells, respectively. Results of the multivariate analysis
including these newly created variables are shown in Table
7. In the absence of maintenance endocrine therapy, no
difference in PFS was seen between patients with hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative
tumors. Conversely, the administration of maintenance
endocrine therapy to women with hormone receptor-positive tumors was associated with a proportional reduction
in the risk of progression of about 48% compared with
the reference group (HR, 0.521; P ¼ .007). A similar
effect of maintenance endocrine therapy on PFS was
observed in women whose tumors showed high hormone
receptor expression, whose risk of disease progression was

receiving maintenance endocrine therapy (HR, 0.747; P
¼ .122). All patients receiving maintenance endocrine
therapy had achieved at least disease stabilization during
trastuzumab-based therapy. To account for this potential
bias, we performed a sensitivity analysis including only
patients with SD or an objective response, but results did
not change (not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective analysis, we found significant associations between hormone receptor status and clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast
cancer receiving trastuzumab with chemotherapy. The
probability of achieving an objective tumor response was
more than halved in patients whose tumors showed high
expression of ER (30% of the cells). We also found that
adding maintenance endocrine therapy to trastuzumab
upon the completion of chemotherapy yielded a significant PFS benefit in patients with 1% of cells staining
positively for ER and/or PGR. Finally, we observed a nonsignificant trend toward an improvement in PFS in
patients whose tumors expressed high levels of ER and/or
PGR in the absence of maintenance endocrine therapy.
The independent value of different definitions of
hormone receptor positivity was corrected for a list of significant predictors of ORR and PFS that were obtained
by multivariate analysis. Most of these clinical variables—

for example, prior exposure to chemotherapy for metastatic disease, short disease-free interval from surgery,
high tumor burden, or visceral involvement—are known
to be associated with clinical outcome in metastatic breast
cancer patients. In addition, we found that patients receiving trastuzumab combined with chemotherapeutic agents
other than taxanes had a reduced likelihood of response.
In particular, those receiving trastuzumab and vinorelbine, which is a popular trastuzumab-based regimen, had
their probability of response halved with respect to those
receiving trastuzumab with a taxane. In the light of the
recent results of a prospective randomized trial showing
equivalence between docetaxel or vinorelbine combined
with trastuzumab in the first-line setting,24 our finding is
likely the result of a bias caused by the retrospective nature
of our analysis. For this reason, it should be considered
only an explanatory variable in our dataset. Similarly, we
believe that our finding that prior exposure to taxanes
before receiving trastuzumab-based therapy had a negative
impact on PFS should be considered with caution. In an
effort to explain this association, we conducted exploratory analyses on the characteristics of this group of 45
patients. Compared with taxane-naive patients, those who
had received a taxane before their first trastuzumab-based
regimen had been exposed more frequently to neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (89% vs 59%; P < .001)
and to anthracyclines (100% vs 52%; P < .001). Furthermore, they had more frequently received trastuzumabbased therapy as second or further line of treatment for
metastatic disease (31% vs 13%; P ¼ .010) and had more
frequently received trastuzumab with chemotherapy other

than taxanes (62% vs 40%; P ¼ .002). All together, these
features suggest that prior exposure to taxanes might not
be directly associated with worse PFS. It rather identifies
in this dataset a population of patients with a sum of factors that can negatively affect PFS. However, a negative
association of prior exposure to taxanes with PFS in
patients receiving trastuzumab-based therapy for metastatic disease is worthy of further investigation. At the
present time, a substantial proportion of HER2-positive
patients recurring after adjuvant chemotherapy are likely
to have been exposed to this class of drugs.
Before discussing the plausibility of our findings, we
shall highlight some limitations of our study. First, it was
a retrospective study of patients treated over a relatively
long period of time with different trastuzumab-based regimens. Second, maintenance endocrine therapy was
administered to 32% of patients with positive hormone
receptor status at the discretion of the treating physician.
From the medical charts and patient characteristics, we
could only ascertain that it was administered in patients
achieving disease stabilization or objective response after a
certain number of cycles of chemotherapy. A sensitivity
analysis considering only patients achieving disease stabilization or objective response to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy confirmed the findings obtained in the entire
dataset. However, we could not exclude that other factors
that influenced the prescription of endocrine therapy
could also be correlated with better outcome. In an effort
to minimize the limitations of the retrospective design, we
selected from a large database only patients who were
treated at 2 institutions with longstanding experience in
the treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, tumor
response evaluations were carried out at the diagnostic
unit of the 2 participating institutions, and imaging was
reviewed for the scope of this analysis.
To our knowledge, only 1 study has evaluated the
antitumor activity of trastuzumab with chemotherapy in
HER2-positive advanced breast according to hormone receptor expression.17 Brufsky et al retrospectively analyzed
patients enrolled in clinical trials of trastuzumab alone or
with chemotherapy including the Pivotal trial.15 The
authors found that patients with hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative tumors achieved similar benefits from trastuzumab with chemotherapy,
compared with chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, in
patients receiving chemotherapy and trastuzumab,
response rate and time to progression did not differ
according to hormone receptor status. It must be noted,
however, that the hormone receptor status was defined as

24

either positive or negative by local laboratories, and the
extent of hormone receptor positivity was not analyzed.
By using the same criteria, considering that thresholds for
hormone receptor positivity have changed over the years
from 1% to 10%, our findings confirm Brufsky’s observation in part. Below the threshold of 30% of immunopositive cells, we could not find a significant difference in
clinical outcomes according to hormone receptor status.
On the contrary, when the extent of hormone receptor
positivity and the effect of the addition of maintenance
endocrine therapy were accounted for, we found significant associations between hormone receptor status and
clinical outcomes. Despite the limitations because of the
retrospective design, our observation strongly suggests
that hormone receptor coexpression identifies 2 subgroups within the HER2-positive subset that differ not
only in prognosis,25 but also in response to current antiHER2 therapeutic strategies. Estrogen receptor expression
has been found to be an independent predictor of reduced
response to chemotherapy20,26; other factors can explain
reduced responsiveness to anti-HER2 therapy in hormone
receptor-coexpressing tumor cells. An inverse relationship
between HER2 and hormone receptor expression has
been previously described by Konecny et al.7 Current
methods to evaluate patients’ eligibility for anti-HER2
therapy are not sensitive to variations in the amount of
HER2 protein that may affect response to HER2 inhibition. Indeed, studies using total HER2 and HER2 homodimer quantification could identify, within what is
commonly defined as HER2-positive status, a direct relationship between protein levels and responsiveness to
anti-HER2 therapy.27,28 In addition, interplay between
HER2 and ER may provide a way to escape HER2 inhibition.29 This interplay, which is bidirectional because
HER positivity confers resistance to endocrine therapy in
tumors that coexpress hormone receptor,8 suggests that simultaneous HER2 and hormone receptor targeting may
be required for optimal disease control in this subset of
patients. Recently, 2 studies evaluated the combination of
an aromatase inhibitor with anti-HER2 therapy consisting of trastuzumab or lapatinib.30,31 In both studies, combined treatment improved response rate and PFS,
compared with endocrine therapy alone. These 2 studies
provide an important proof of principle, and in our opinion, a platform for future development in patients with
HER2-positive/hormone receptor-positive tumors.
In summary, we observed that HER2-positive
tumors also expressing high levels of hormone receptor
may be less responsive to the addition chemotherapy plus

trastuzumab, a finding that is consistent with 2 recently
presented international randomized neoadjuvant trials.
The PFS prolongation seen in patients adding endocrine
therapy to trastuzumab upon the completion of chemotherapy suggests that these tumors retain endocrine
responsiveness. If confirmed in independent datasets, this
predictive role of hormone receptor expression would
have therapeutic implications. Further research is warranted to optimize the use of HER2-targeting agents,
chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy in patients whose
tumors coexpress both HER2 and hormone receptor.
