ABSTRACT
Binding of leukemia cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix (ECM) through
integrins might influence drug response and the survival of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). However, the functions of integrin in AML are needed to be clarified. Data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved and integrin β3 (ITGB3)
expression and prognostic significance for AML were analyzed. Integrin alphavbeta3
(αvβ3) in sorafenib sensitivity and signaling pathway of FLT3-ITD AML cells was
evaluated in vitro. The level of ITGB3 expression was positively correlated with risk
stratification and prognosis of AML patients, especially in cytogenetic-normal patients
with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation.
Integrin αvβ3 decreased sorafenib sensitivity when co-culture of MV4-11 cells and
bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and it is crucial for osteopontin (OPN) induced
sorafenib insensitivity in FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells. Mechanically, αvβ3 enhance
β-catenin activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Akt/ Glycogen
synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) pathway. Moreover, genetic inhibition of β-catenin by
shRNA could increase sorafenib sensitivity in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, our study
revealed a novel mechanism in microenvironment influence on sorafenib sensitivity
in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation that was caused by activating integrin αvβ3/ PI3K/
Akt/ GSK3β/ β-catenin pathway. Integrin αvβ3/ β-catenin could be considered as a
new therapeutic target for AML especially for FLT3-ITD mutated AML.

compounds [4]. Although some TKIs could achieve high
remission rate both in peripheral blood and bone marrow,
leukemia cells usually relapse in a short period of time [5].
One reason is that TKIs execute subclone selection in vivo,
amplifying drug insensitive clones, such as FLT3 point
mutation (D835Y) clone [6]. Another reason is that drug
resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs) were protected from
bone marrow niche, leukemia then re-established from
LSCs under certain conditions such as TKI withdraw [7].

INTRODUCTION
Great progress has been achieved in AML
treatment through past decades, however, some types of
AML, especially AML with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3
internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation, which
comprised of 20-30% AML [1], are still incurable using
currently approaches except for allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation [2]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) emerging as targeted therapy appeared most
exciting therapeutics in FLT3-ITD treatment, such
as multikinase inhibitor sorafenib [3] and some new

High level of ITGB3 expression is associated
with shorter overall survival of AML patients,
especially in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation

indicate that integrins are involved in leukemia/
microenvironment interaction by influencing both cell
growth and drug sensitivity [9]. For instance, interaction
of α4β1 and α5β1 in leukemia cells with fibronection in
stromal contributes to chemo-insensitivity and minimal
residual disease of AML [10, 11]. Integrin β could directly
interact with integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which could
trigger downstream signaling pathway, such as PI3K/
Akt pathway, resulting in cell survival and proliferation
[12]. Recently, an in vivo small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
screening approach was used to find out integrin β3 was
required for leukemogenesis and LSCs transcriptional
programs maintenance in a MLL-AF9 AML mouse
model. They also found that integrin αv, which formed a
heterodimer with integrin β3, also required for maintaining
the leukemic phenotype [13].
In this paper, we demonstrated that the expression
level of integrin β3 was associated with the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk
stratification and could be a novel prognostic biomarker
in AML especially in cytogenetic-normal FLT3ITD mutated AML patients. Integrin αvβ3 decreased
sorafenib sensitivity when co-culture MV4-11 cells with
BMSCs, and it is crucial for OPN induced sorafenib
insensitivity in FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells. αvβ3
could enhance β-catenin activation through PI3K/ Akt/
GSK3β pathway. Our study revealed a novel mechanism
in microenvironment influence on sorafenib sensitivity
in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation.

To determine the prognostic value of ITGB3
expression in AML patients, we evaluated the overall
survival (OS) of all patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
The median follow-up in this cohort was 557.4 days (02861 days). Cut-off value of ITGB3 expression (RNA-Seq
by Expectation Maximization, RSEM) is set to -0.10 so
that the numbers in two groups are similar [ITGB3 high
group (n=81): -0.09 to 6.80; ITGB3 low group (n=82):
-6.86 to -0.11]. As shown in Figure 1B, elevated ITGB3
expression was significantly correlated with shorter OS
(p<0.05). Then we analyzed the OS depended on ITGB3
expression in each group according to prognostic risk
stratification of NCCN. The OS was significantly worse
when higher expression level of ITGB3 in poor prognostic
group (Figure 1E), however, there was no correlation
in favorable and intermediate groups (Figure 1C, 1D),
Mutation of FLT3 was frequent and indicated poor
prognosis in AML [1]. We thus compared the prognostic
significance of ITGB3 on AML patients with or without
FLT3 mutation. In FLT3 wild type AML patients, there
was no difference of OS between two groups depends on
the expression level of ITGB3 (Figure 1F), however, in
patients who had normal cytogenetics with FLT3 mutation,
the OS of patients with higher ITGB3 expression was
significantly worse compared that of patients with lower
ITGB3 (Figure 1G).

RESULTS
Relationship between ITGB3 expression and
clinicopathological features of AML patients

To figure out the function of ITGB3 in FLT3-ITD
AML in bone marrow environment, we used BMSCs to
mimic bone marrow environment. We co-cultured MV4-11
cells (a FLT3-ITD mutation AML cell line) with BMSCs
and tested the sensitivity of sorafenib, a TKI proved
by Food and Drug Administration for hepatocellular
carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. As showed in Figure
2A, MV4-11 was sensitive to sorafenib, by the 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC-50) around 10μM (data not
shown). Sorafenib induced apoptosis in MV4-11, the
apoptotic rate was 38.15% (±1.48). When co-cultured with
BMSCs, MV4-11 showed significantly reduced apoptosis
rate under sorafenib treatment, the apoptosis rate was
20.54% (±0.44) (Figure 2A, 2B). This phenomenon could
be explained by cell adhesion mediated drug resistance.
However, when we blocked αvβ3 by pretreating with
αvβ3 blocking antibody, this effect was significantly
decreased. MV4-11 showed increased apoptosis rate after
αvβ3 blocking (Figure 2A, 2B). We also detected lower

To investigate the prognostic significance of
ITGB3 gene expression in human AML, we mined
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database which is
available to public. The clinicopathological features of
all AML patients are categorized in Table 1. We found
that the patients with higher ITGB3 expression were
older (median age, 57.8 vs 52.8 years; p<0.05) and
had a higher proportion of patients with unfavorable
cytogenetics (p=0.002) compared with patients who
had lower ITGB3 expression. Moreover, we found
patients with higher ITGB3 expression had lower blasts
in peripheral and bone marrow, lower WBC counts,
higher platelet counts compared with the patients with
lower ITGB3 expression (p<0.05). When grouped
with prognostic risk stratification of AML according to
NCCN, the expression level of ITGB3 was significantly
higher in poor group than in favorable and intermediate
groups (Figure 1A).

that bone marrow stromal cells secreted more OPN when

could bind integrin αvβ3. We also tested the effect of
OPN and αvβ3 in MV4-11. OPN could induce sorafenib
insensitivity of MV4-11 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S2). These effects could be partly
abrogated by αvβ3 blocking. These results suggested that
integrin αvβ3 induced leukemia insensitivity to sorafenib
when co-cultured with BMSCs as well as OPN ligation.

abrogated when blocking αvβ3 before OPN ligation,
indicating β-catenin elevation is αvβ3 dependent and
through PI3K/ Akt/ GSK3β signaling pathway (Figure
3B). We also detected higher phosphorylation of Akt,
GSK3β and β-catenin when co-culture MV4-11 with
BMSCs, and αvβ3 antibody could partly reduce them
(Supplementary Figure S4). To further validate PI3K/
Akt/ GSK3β contributes to β-catenin elevation and drug
sensitivity, we used PI3K specific inhibitor LY294002.
As we expected, p-Akt, p-GSK3β and β-catenin were
decreased after PI3K inhibition (Figure 3C). Sorafenib
sensitivity was increased after PI3K inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S2). These results indicated that
OPN/ αvβ3 activated β-catenin and through PI3K/ Akt/
GSK3β signaling pathway.

It was reported that OPN/ αvβ3 pathway promote
a cancer stem cell-like phenotype in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. Because the Wingless-type (Wnt)/
β-catenin is the most important cancer stem cell
pathway, we hypothesized that αvβ3 could activated
β-catenin in MV4-11 cells. We detected higher β-catenin
level in OPN treated MV4-11 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3A). The elevated β-catenin was largely
contributed by β-catenin in the nuclear (Supplementary
Figure S3). Moreover, we observed higher
phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β and β-catenin in OPN
treated MV4-11 (Figure 3B). This effect was largely

β-catenin interference could enhance leukemia sensitivity in
MV4-11 cells (Figure 4E, 4F).

To determine the effect of β-catenin in leukemia cells,
we knocked down β-catenin in MV4-11 using lentiviral
delivery of shRNA. To avoided off-target effect, we used
two shRNAs which targeted different code sequence of
Ctnnb1 and a scramble shRNA as control. β-catenin was
dramatically reduced in Ctnnb1 knock down cells (shCtnnb1 cells) by western blotting and real time qPCR assay
(Figure 4A, 4B). MV4-11 cell viability was decreased
after Ctnnb1 knocked down (Figure 4C). When exposed in
different concentration of sorafenib, the cell viability was
decreased gradually in each group. However, at the same
concentration of sorafenib, the cell viability was higher in
control cells compared with sh-Ctnnb1 cells (Figure 4D).
Sh-Ctnnb1 cells underwent spontaneous apoptosis. When

DISCUSSION
Integrins enhance cell-ECM interaction, intracellular
signal transduction, contributing to tumor invasiveness
and metastasis [14]. Integrin comprises of two subunits,
alpha and beta chain, which form a heterodimer. Integrin
beta3 (ITGB3) loss impairs AML survival and homing
to endosteum [13]. ITGB3 has prognostic significance in
AML especially for unfavorable group and patients with
FLT3-ITD mutation according to our data. Higher level
of ITGB3 implies older and higher frequency of poor
cytogenetics. However, there are significant lower WBC
counts, lower blast and higher platelet accompanied with
higher level of ITGB3, indicating ITGB3 signaling is

FLT3-ITD positive AML patients might benefit from
TKIs combining with integrin αvβ3 blocker and β-catenin
inhibitors. Several αvβ3 antibody and β-catenin inhibitors
are under clinical trial in several cancer types [25–30].
Based on our study, these compounds might be considered
as new pharmaceuticals for therapy of AML with FLT3ITD mutation combined with TKIs.
Collectively, we demonstrated that integrin β3 has
prognostic significance in AML especially in cytogeneticnormal AML with FLT3-ITD mutation. Integrin
αvβ3/ PI3K/ Akt/ GSK3β/ β-catenin axis is crucial for
microenvironment mediated TKI insensitivity in FLT3ITD AML cells (A schematic drawing is shown in Figure
5). Our data provides a new mechanistic basis for integrin
αvβ3 signaling in drug insensitivity in bone marrow
microenvironment. Targeting integrin αvβ3/ PI3K/ Akt/
β-catenin signaling might be helpful improving the
prognosis of FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients.

not associated with higher leukemia proliferation rate.
In myeloid cells, ITGB3 heterodimerizes with ITAV and
interact with ECM [15]. We also analyze ITGAV and its
clinical relevant, however, there is no significant relevant
in TCGA database (data not shown). Whether ITGAV has
clinical relevant needs further investigation.
Integrin αvβ3 could bind arginine-glycine-aspartate
(RGD)-containing components of matrix, such as OPN,
vitronectin and fibronectin, trigger intracellular signal
[16]. OPN/ αvβ3 was found to drive tumor stemness
and resistant to TKI inhibition in solid tumor [17, 18].
In this study, we give evidence that integrin αvβ3 could
alternatively enhance β-catenin activation in AML.
β-catenin signaling contributes to leukemia stem cell
phenotype and influences drug sensitivity in leukemia
[19–21]. It is also an independent prognostic indicator in
AML [22]. β-catenin could be activated in several ways.
First, several Wnt ligands are constitutive expressed
in most AML cells and bone marrow stromal cells,
leading to Wnt/ β-catenin signaling in AML [19, 23].
Second, FLT3-ITD positive AML has ligand independent
activated form of FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase and
causes increased activated form of β-catenin [24]. Here,
we give evidence that integrin αvβ3 could alternatively
enhance β-catenin activation through PI3K/ Akt/ GSK3β
cascade on linking OPN from microenvironment, giving
an another interpretation on β-catenin activation in FLT3ITD mutated AML.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. QRT-PCR was performed
using SYBR Premix ExTaq (Takara, Japan) and an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of primers
used in this study were listed in Table 2. The PCR cycling
conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 15s and 60°C for 35s. Beta-actin
(Actb) was used as an internal normalization control.
Data analyses were performed using the comparative CT
(ΔΔCT) method for calculating relative gene expression.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS software,
version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The normality
distribution test was performed with the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Clinical features of sex and FLT3 mutation
rate were compared between ITGB3 high and low groups
by the Pearson χ2 test. Clinical features of FAB classification
and Cytogenetic abnormality were compared between two
groups using Fisher’s exact test. Other clinical features of
age, peripheral blast, bone marrow blast, WBC count, Hb
concentration and Platelet count between two groups were
compared using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test.
Overall survival curves were plotted according to the
Kaplan-Meier methods with the log-rank test applied for
comparison. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test for two
