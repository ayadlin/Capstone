BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT-UC) was a rare, aggressive urologic cancer
with a propensity for multifocality, local recurrence, and metastasis. High-risk patients had poor outcomes. Because
of the rarity of these tumors, randomized clinical trials and data regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in locally
advanced tumors are currently unavailable. Our objective was to assess the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy and
the impact of potential prognostic factors on survival in high-risk, postsurgical UUT-UC patients. METHODS: Using
a multi-institutional, international retrospective database, identified were 627 patients with high risk UUT-UCs
(pT3N0, pT4N0 and/or Nþ and/or Mþ) who underwent surgical removal. Only patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were included. RESULTS: Overall, 140 patients (22.6%) with a median age of 67 years were included. The
median follow-up was 22.5 months. The 5-year, overall survival for the entire cohort was 43%, the 5-year recurrencefree survival was 54%, and metastasis-free survival was 53% at 5 years. Positive surgical margins were an independent prognostic factor for recurrence (P ¼ .06), cancer-specific mortality (P ¼ .05), and overall mortality (P ¼ .02) of
any cause. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not linked with overall or cancer-specific survival in patients with high risk
disease (adjuvant chemotherapy [n ¼ 140] vs no treatment [n ¼ 487]) (P >.5). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy did not offer any significant benefit to overall survival in our population. Additional data were necessary, and studies enrolling patients at high risk in clinical trials investigating neoadjuvant chemotherapy in

Outcomes After Adjuvant Chemotherapy in UUT-UC/Vassilakopoulou et al

Urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract
(UUT-UCs) are rare tumors that account for 5% to 10%
of all urothelial carcinomas.1-3 Invasive UUT-UCs have a
poor prognosis. Patients’ survival is mainly influenced by
stage, and 5-year survival rates range from 90% in early
pathologic stages (pTa/pT1) to less than 5% in stages
with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. Consequently, almost half of the patients with stage T3 or
lymph node involvement die from their disease, mainly as
a result of distant metastases developing.1,4,5 Radical
nephroureterectomy is the standard of care in UUTUCs.2,3,6 Stage and grade are considered to be major
prognostic factors of outcome after surgery.1,3,4 There are
several difficulties involved with the treatment of these
tumors, such as diagnosis at a late stage, multifocality,
poor differentiation, and poor prognosis.3,7,8 Nevertheless, the high recurrence and mortality rates in high-risk
patients indicate the essential role of effective additional
adjuvant treatment.
Because of the rarity of these tumors, randomized
clinical trials comparing different treatment modalities are
not available and data regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in
locally advanced UUT-UCs are currently sparse.9-12 In
2009, Hellenthal et al retrospectively identified, from a
multicenter database, 542 patients who underwent nephroureterectomy for T3, T4, and/or node-positive clinically
nonmetastatic UUT-UCs.13 In the current study, our aim
was to report available data regarding the role of adjuvant
chemotherapy in the treatment of UUT-UC after radical
surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population
A multi-institutional, international retrospective study
was conducted that included patients from our French
national database on UUT-UCs* and from 1 center in
Greece. Overall, 627 patients with locally advanced/highrisk UUT-UCs (pT3N0, pT4N0, and/or lymph node
positive, and/or metastasis) who underwent surgical resection were selected from our multicentric database. Their
medical files were reviewed to collect the following data:
localization of the primary tumor, tumor stage at diagnosis (TNM 2009),14 tumor grade (WHO classification),15
surgical margins status and vascular invasion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status,
surgical procedure (nephroureterectomy with open bladder cuff or other conservative procedures), chemotherapy
regimen administered, adjuvant radiotherapy adminis-

tered, date of diagnosis, date of relapse or disease progression, date of last visit or death, and cause of death.
Chemotherapy Regimens
Only patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy
within 6 months of surgery were included in the current
study. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy in various combinations was the most common regimen, depending on the
patients’ eligibility and renal function. Cisplatin was
administered intravenously in a 1-hour infusion, at a median dose of 75 mg/m2 of body surface area (calculated
using appropriate formulas from the height and weight of
the patient) every 3 weeks, if renal function and circulating blood elements were at acceptable levels (creatinine
clearance  60 mL/min, platelets  100,000/mm2, and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes  1,000/mm2). Mannitol
and pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid
infused for 8 to 12 hours before the cisplatin dose were
used to reduce nephrotoxicity. A prophylactic regimen of
cortisone in combination with antiemetics (including
setrones) was administered to reduce the severity of cisplatin-induced delayed emesis. Additional administration of
magnesium and potassium was used to avoid electrolyte
disturbances related to cisplatin-induced renal tubular
damage. Adequate hydration was maintained and urinary
output was monitored over the following 24 hours.
Whenever it was used in combination with paclitaxel, cisplatin was administered after paclitaxel to avoid increased
hematologic toxicity due to decreased clearance. Patients
unfit for cisplatin (eg, those with impaired renal function
or poor performance status) were treated with carboplatin-based or single-agent regimens. Carboplatin was given
in a dose of 5 AUC, which was calculated using the Calvert formula, carboplatin dose (mg) ¼ AUC  [CrCl
(mL/min)þ25] (AUC ¼ area under the curve), or using
appropriate carboplatin dose formulas dependent on the
renal function of the patient.
Statistical Analysis
All patients were followed from diagnosis until death or
until the data were censored (with the patient still considered to be alive). Overall survival was evaluated from the
date of surgery to the last follow-up visit or death. Recurrence-free survival was defined as the period between surgery and the subsequent appearance of recurrence or
metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated
using censured data and compared using the log-rank test.
Univariate analyses were used to assess associations
between potential prognostic factors (ie, age, gender,

age of 67 years. The male-to-female ratio was 2.8. Most of
these patients presented with a high-grade tumor (grade 3
for 122 patients and grade 2 for 13). The majority of the
patients had a low performance status (0-1), whereas 12 of
them presented with a higher 1 due to comorbidities. Follow-up consisted of surveillance cystoscopy every 3 to 6
months after surgery and imaging studies of the urinary
tract and the whole body every 6 months to 1 year.
Surgery
In the group of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, the most common treatment was radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff removal, which was
performed in 110 patients; 23 patients underwent nephrectomy with incomplete ureterectomy, 6 patients
underwent segmental ureterectomy, and 1 patient underwent endoscopic resection of the tumor. In the second
group, the most common treatment was also radical neph-

roureterectomy with bladder cuff removal, which was
performed in 428 patients; 49 patients underwent
nephrectomy with incomplete ureterectomy, and 10
patients underwent segmental ureterectomy.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy
The mean number of cycles was 4.4. cisplatin-based
chemotherapy in various combinations was the most commonly administered therapy: 35 patients received cisplatinþgemcitabine; 31 received carboplatin-paclitaxel; 23
received carboplatin-gemcitabine; 19 received methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (MVAC); and 17
received cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine (CMV).
Table 2 reports the most commonly used chemotherapy
regimens, and Table 3 depicts the adjuvant chemotherapy
regimens administered.
Survival and Recurrence
First, adjuvant chemotherapy after nephroureterectomy
did not significantly correlate with overall or cancerspecific survival in patients with high-risk disease (ie, adjuvant chemotherapy [n ¼ 140] versus no adjuvant treatment [n ¼ 487]) (P >.5)).
In our population who received adjuvant chemotherapy, the median follow-up was 22.5 months (range,
10-50 months), and the mean follow-up was 37.4 months
(range, 1-158 months). At the end of the study, 78
patients had died and 32 patients were still available.
Among these patients, 49 died from the evolution of

survival and specific survival for the entire cohort who
received adjuvant chemotherapy were 43% and 60%
respectively (Fig. 1).
By univariate analysis, positive surgical margins and
the presence of metastatic sites at the time of surgery were
significantly associated with cancer-specific mortality
(P ¼ .01, .006, and .02 for R1, R2, and metastatic sites,
respectively), whereas age, gender, tumor stage, grade,

analysis, positive surgical margins were the sole
independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific mortality (P ¼ .03).

The 5-year recurrence-free survival was 54%. By

Metastasis-free survival was 53% at 5 years. Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant association
between metastasis-free survival and the presence of metastatic sites at the time of surgery (P <.001), microscopic

DISCUSSION
Urothelial carcinoma, of the upper (UUT-UC) and lower
(bladder) urinary tract, are considered to be relatively chemosensitive.9,13,16,17 In fact, most of the data regarding
the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant
and adjuvant settings are based on outcomes from the
treatment of bladder UC.17,18 Contrary to what has been
demonstrated for bladder cancer, there have been no
reported effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for UUTUCs. Adjuvant chemotherapy achieves a remission rate of
up to 50% but has minimal impact on survival. However,
because of the low frequency of UUT-UCs, there are few
reported series that have included more than 50
patients.3,9,16
To date, however, radical surgery represents the only
potentially curable therapeutic intervention for patients
with UUT-UCs.2,3 Although the role of lymphadenectomy
in these tumors has not yet been clarified, recent evidence
has shown that, in patients with locally advanced tumors, it
improves staging and consequently could help in selecting
patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.19,20 Systemic recurrences are common in this disease; however, and it is, therefore, reasonable to consider perioperative chemotherapy in
an effort to decrease a patient’s risk of recurrence.21
In our study, the median survival was 22.5 months,
the median recurrence-free survival was 16 months and
the median metastasis-free survival was 19 months. The
median survival in our study is consistent with those
reported in previous studies;9,10,13 therefore, our study
suggests that adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy does
not add any significant benefit with respect to overall survival in this group of high-risk patients. A possible explanation for the findings of this study may be that this
subgroup of patients presented with a more advanced disease that had high-risk features that would have limited
survival expectancy anyway. Adding a certain chemotherapy-related toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity from platinum derivatives, to a population with an already
impaired postsurgical renal function may also be related
to the reduced survival in these patients. The impact and
possible benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for progression-free survival and metastasis-free survival are uncertain, as clinical studies evaluating these parameters are
lacking. According to the recently updated European

5506

guidelines on UUT-UCs, there are no benefits from radical nephroureterectomy in metastatic (Mþ) disease,
although it can be considered as a palliative option.3 Additionally one would also consider certain crucial points
before prescribing chemotherapy such as local response
rate, pain relief, or quality of life improvement, which
remain unexplored so far in these patients.
Given that UUT-UCs are urothelial tumors, one
would expect results similar to those seen in bladder cancer from platinum-based chemotherapy. In fact, several
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens have been proposed. From Hellenthal et al, out of 121 high risk
patients, 22% received adjuvant chemotherapy.13 The
patients received an average of 3.1 cycles of chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 26 months. Median survival in the group with chemotherapy was 24 months; in
the group without chemotherapy, it was 26 months. Adjuvant chemotherapy was more commonly administered
in the context of increased tumor grade and stage. Chemotherapy was platinum based in 97% of the patients and
consisted of MVAC in most cases.
Our study identified positive surgical margins as the
only independent prognostic factor for overall survival
and recurrence-free survival in patients with high risk
UUT-UCs. Recently, Novara et al. showed that positive
margins status after radical cystectomy was a powerful independent prognostic factor of disease recurrence and
cancer-specific mortality; therefore, they advocated
reporting it systematically in pathologic reports.22 The
authors underlined the necessity of considering it in further studies on adjuvant local and/or systemic therapy.
For UUT-UCs, there is an association between overall
survival and positive surgical margins and local recurrence
at the anastomotic site,23 and they have been implicated
in a greater risk of secondary metachronous UUT-UCs.24
Thus, our data suggest that the presence of positive surgical margins can markedly affect the patients’ prognosis;
therefore, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are of
substantial significance.
Although tumor grade, stage, and lymph node
involvement are considered by most authors as major
prognostic factors for identification of high-risk patients
and predicting outcomes after surgery,1,5 several other
clinicopathologic characteristics are considered to have a
prognostic significance for invasive UUT-UCs. Among
them, the presence of vascular invasion has consistently
been associated with a poor prognosis.5,25 It has been
reported that lymphovascular status in patients without
clinically evident metastasis can identify patients with

occult metastases, such as micrometastases or false-negative lymph nodes26; therefore, it can help identify patients
who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.
In the present study, adjuvant radiotherapy was
shown to be an independent prognostic factor (P ¼
.04) for MFS. In our series, 9 patients received adjuvant
radiotherapy after the resection of their primary tumor.
In general, radiotherapy is believed to act by destroying
residual carcinoma cells in the surgical wound bed;
therefore, this therapy is considered to be particularly
effective in patients with positive surgical margins. Few
data support the routine use of adjuvant radiotherapy
in UUT-UC tumors.27,28 Collectively, these data argue
that it would be reasonable to consider adding systemic
chemotherapy along with postoperative radiotherapy in
patients with locally advanced, positive surgical margins
or lymph node metastases. However, it is uncertain to
what extent the increase in UUT-UC–specific MFS in
this subset of patients was influenced by the adjuvant
radiotherapy, the adjuvant chemotherapy, or their
combination.
Finally, we believe that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
is an approach that should be evaluated more thoroughly
for UUT-UCs (as it has been for bladder cancer17,29). An
important consideration is the major loss of renal reserve
these patients experience after radical nephroureterectomy.30 Therefore, delivering effective doses of cytotoxic
agents, particularly nephrotoxic platinum-based chemotherapy, is precluded.31 In addition, the morbidity of
chemotherapy itself is far from being negligible and one
should consider it carefully before deciding to launch it in
these patients. Lastly, we found, as previously shown,13
that at least 1 of 4 to 5 patients received indeed chemotherapy in daily practice, although there is no recommendation advocating this prescription.3 In the absence of
strong data from the evidence-based medicine, it seems
that chemotherapy is often prescribed on a subjective
assessment without any solid scientific rationale in these
patients.

CONCLUSION
Our retrospective study showed that postoperative chemotherapy did not have any significant effect on survival in
high-risk patients with UUT-UCs. To date, this is the second large study that has clearly demonstrated that there is
no point in doing adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
UUT-UCs at least for a survival purpose. Only additional
data from clinical trials investigating postoperative chemCancer

otherapy in these patients would be in a position to properly address this question. Obviously, such data will not
be available quickly, as UUT-UCs are rare. Therefore,
this type of treatment should be prohibited outside of
randomized clinical trials.
