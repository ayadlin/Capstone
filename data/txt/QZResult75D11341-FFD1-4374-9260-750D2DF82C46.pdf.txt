ABSTRACT
Purpose: Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that 1’-S-1’acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) isolated from rhizomes of the Malaysian ethnomedicinal plant Alpinia conchigera Griff (Zingiberaceae) induces apoptosis-mediated
cell death in tumour cells via dysregulation of the NF-κB pathway. However there were
some clinical development drawbacks such as poor in vivo solubility, depreciation
of biological activity upon exposure to an aqueous environment and non-specific
targeting of tumour cells. In the present study, all the problems above were addressed
using the novel drug complex formulation involving recombinant human alpha
fetoprotein (rhAFP) and ACA.
Experimental Design: To study the synergistic effect of both agents on human
cancer xenografts, athymic nude (Nu/Nu) mice were used and treated with
various combination regimes intraperitoneally. Serum levels of tumour markers for
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were assessed
using sandwich ELISA. IHC and Western blotting were also conducted on in vivo
tumour biopsies to investigate the involvement of NF-κB regulated genes and
inflammatory biomarkers. Quantification and correlation between drug efficacies and
AFP-receptors were done using IF-IC and Pearson’s correlation analysis.
Results: Mice exposed to combined treatments displayed higher reductions in
tumour volume compared to stand alone agents, consistent with in vitro cytotoxicity
assays. Milder signs of systemic toxicity, such as loss in body weight and inflammation
of vital organs were also demonstrated compared to stand alone treatments. Tumour
marker levels were consistent within all rhAFP/ACA treatment groups where levels
of CEA and PSA were initially elevated upon commencement of treatment, and
consecutively reduced corresponding to a decrease in tumour bulk volume. Both IHC
and Western blotting results indicated that the combined action of rhAFP/ACA was
not only able to down-regulate NF-κB activation, but also reduce the expression of

NF-κB regulated genes and inflammatory biomarkers. The efficacy of rhAFP/ACA complex
was also found to be weakly negatively correlated to the level of surface AFP-receptors
between tumour types.
Conclusions: This drug complex formulation shows great therapeutic potential against
AFP-receptor positive tumours, and serves as a basis to overcome insoluble and nonspecific anti-neoplastic molecules.

INTRODUCTION

development limitations such as poor solubility in aqueous
solution, declining biological activity upon exposure
to an aqueous environment and poor specific targeting
of tumour cells for its therapeutic use in vivo making it
less desirable for cancer treatment. These problems are
common in polyphenols, isoflavons or flavonoids of plantderived anti-tumour compounds which have extremely
low solubility in water and require polar solvents, such as
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol or certain medicinal
oils, to be soluble. Therefore, we sought to search for
counter measures to address ACA’s drawback as a
potential chemotherapeutic agent.
Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) has been well known to
bind and transport a multitude of ligands such as bilirubin,
fatty acids, retinoids, steroids, hormones, flavonoids,
phytoestrogens, heavy metals, dioxins and various
organic drugs [5]. Functions of AFP includes, its use as
growth and differentiation factors for embryonic stem
cells and tissues [6], operates as a suppressive factor for
tumours [7] or activated immune cells [8], and does not
affect the proliferation of normal untransformed cells [9].
Since a large number of tumours express AFP-receptors
in addition to normal hepatocytes, AFP could be seen
as a death factor, highly selective against tumour cells
but completely non-toxic to normal cells. It has been
shown earlier that human AFP can be actively expressed
in E. coli [10] as well as in yeast cells [11-12], with
recombinant AFPs having biological properties related,
but not identical to native human AFPs [11-12]. It was
also shown that these recombinant human AFPs (rhAFP)
acts as a non-covalent carrier for various active apoptosisinducing water-insoluble ingredients aimed at cells
expressing AFP receptors (AFPRs) [10, 13-14]. Thus, the
concept of developing drug conjugates or complexes to
optimize patients’ tolerance and increasing the anti-tumour
efficiency of common chemotherapeutic drugs via directed
delivery of cytotoxic agents towards the target cells using
protein molecules seems to be a very promising strategy.
Interactions of pharmaceutical drugs with serum
constituents are an important issue in drug delivery.
Transport protein molecules can be classified as specific
selective carriers and unselective carriers, where the
former should provide targeted delivery of cytotoxic
ligands selectively to tumour cells while avoiding normal
cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop
a complex formulation of ACA with a specific carrier
such as rhAFP for selective targeting of tumour cells for
clinical use, especially in injectable forms as the substance
is practically insoluble in water. Development of non-

Cancer is amongst one of the most challenging
health problems in the world today. Even with
advances in medical science disciplines such as surgery,
immunotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
and radiotherapy, there is still no significant progress
in its treatment. The conventional radiotherapy and
chemotherapy with synthetic drugs used in treating
cancer are not only expensive, but also induce severe
side effects including immunosuppression, organ failure
and susceptibility toward infectious diseases which may
cause the death of patients upon treatment [1]. Thus, more
efficient and low cost drugs that evoke lower systemic
toxicity via specific targeting of cancer cells would be
desirable in cancer management and treatment. Strategies
involving combined therapies or agents with distinct
molecular mechanisms are considered more promising
for higher efficacy and better survival. The rationale for
combination therapy is to use drugs that work by different
mechanisms of action to decrease the likelihood of
resistant cancer cell development. As a consequence, there
is an increase in the number of preclinical and clinical
studies involving novel combinations of anti-cancer drug
therapies and chemopotentiating agents to improve cancer
treatment outcome [2].
We have previously demonstrated that 1’-S-1’acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) isolated from rhizomes of
the Malaysian ethno-medicinal plant, Alpinia conchigera
Griff (Zingiberaceae), induces apoptosis-mediated
cell death on various cancer cell lines while minimally
affecting HMEC normal cells in vitro and in vivo [3-4].
Additionally, ACA further enhanced the cytotoxic effects
of cisplatin (CDDP) in a synergistic manner, acting as
a chemopotentiator. Its combined effects with CDDP
in vivo produce an improved chemotherapeutic regime
with increased efficacies at lower concentrations, which
could hypothetically reduce the occurrence of doselimiting toxicities. We also found that the effects of ACA
correlated with a down-regulation of NF-κB regulated
genes (FASL and BIM), including proinflammatory (COX2) and proliferative (cyclin D1) biomarkers in tumour
tissues. Consequent to this, ACA was deemed to inhibit
the constitutive activation of NF-κB through suppression
of IKKα/β activation modulated through dysregulation of
the NF-κB pathway [4].
Despite the strong molecular basis that showed
ACA’s capability to increase the cytotoxic efficacy
on human tumour cell lines, there were some clinical

covalent hydrophobic pocket interactions between the

measuring the heat melting parameters, such as enthalpy
of denaturation transition and temperatures, which are
characteristic parameters for the conformational state
of protein macromolecules. In this study, adiabatic
scanning microcalorimetry technique was used to
assess the interaction of hydrophobic ACA molecules,
by forming a stable non-covalent complex with
rhAFP as a carrier protein. Lipophilic drugs can enter
the hydrophobic binding sites of rhAFP and affect
thermodynamic parameters including the specific excess
heat capacity, specific enthalpy of denaturation transition
and temperature, thereby allowing the monitoring of
ligand binding processes through the observation of
conformational change manifestations. Information
on the steric structure of formed complexes allows
visualization on the conformational change in rhAFP
molecules due to hydrophobic ACA binding, indicating
the formation of a non-covalent complex (Figure 1).
Thermodynamic parameters obtained for various rhAFP

significant decrease in values of denaturation enthalpies,

RESULTS

Previous research have shown that AFP can bind

significant stabilization of the tertiary structure of the
protein with respect to thermal melting [12]. These
conformational changes can be easily monitored by

indicates that changes in thermodynamic parameters of
the rhAFP molecule induced by ACA removal reflected
destabilization of the rhAFP tertiary structure. On the
other hand, loading of rhAFP with ACA led to a notable
increase in denaturation temperatures and enthalpy values
of distinct transitions, showing stabilization of rhAFP’s

tested on HMEC normal mammary epithelial cells, where
AFPRs are expected to be minimal or absent, the toxicity
of ACA stand alone was clearly reduced in the presence
of rhAFP, with a 30% increase in viability, suggesting
the successful tumour targeting nature of rhAFP/ACA
complex (Figure 2). In vitro cytotoxicity data also suggests
that the molar ratio between rhAFP and ACA from 1:1
to 1:3 was a suitable combination range, and that further
improvements on tumour suppression efficacies cannot be
determined at ratios above 1:3 as there are no viable cells
present (Figure 2).

In vitro cytotoxic effects of rhAFP/ACA complex
In order to evaluate the efficacy of ACA in
combination with rhAFP, MTT assays were performed
on six human cancer cell lines, which were NSCLC
(A549 and SK-LU-1), prostate (PC-3 and DU 145),
cervical (Ca Ski) and oral (HSC-4) cancer cells. The
rhAFP/ACA complex was successful in increasing the
cytotoxic efficacy in comparison to stand alone ACA
treatments in most of the cell lines tested (Figure 2).
Significant cytotoxic improvements were obtained in
rhAFP/ACA treated PC-3 and A549 cells, with reductions
of ~50.0% and ~25% respectively at ≥1:3 molar ratios in
comparison to ACA stand alone treatments. The overall
efficacy of combined rhAFP/ACA regime was found
to be consistently improved between all other cell lines
tested (with the exception of DU 145 and SK-LU-1 cells)
within an effective therapeutic IC50 dose of 1.50 μM to
2.50 μM when used with a fixed rhAFP concentration of
5.0 µM (data not shown). This indicates that a low rhAFP
dose notably enhances efficacy of ACA cytotoxicity
allowing significant decrease of effective therapeutic
doses, and possibly enhanced specificity towards cancer
cells. When MTT assays employing various combination
ratios of ACA with rhAFP ranging from 1:1 to 1:5 was
carried out, we found that efficacy improvements in A549
cancer cells were more prominent at lower viability levels
(<30%) and were more dependent on different molarity
ratios compared to its effects on PC-3 cancer cells. When

Potentiation of in vivo anti-tumour effects by
rhAFP/ACA complex
Two groups of murine NSCLC and prostate cancer
xenograft models were used to assess the anti-tumour
therapeutic of rhAFP/ACA complex in vivo. We found
that all molar ratios of rhAFP/ACA tested resulted in
superior tumour volume regression compared to placebo,
ACA stand alone, rhAFP stand alone and CDDP positive
control groups (Figure 3). In the therapeutic group, molar
ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 were found to be the most effective in
reducing tumour volume, thereby also indicating that these
regimens were the optimum complexing ratio between
free hydrophobic pockets on rhAFP with insoluble ACA.
It was also noted that when treatment was ceased, tumour
volume manifested significantly comparable to placebo
bulk volumes within just 2 weeks, presumably due to
pre-mature regime termination resulting in an incomplete
eradication of tumour remnants (Supplementary Figure 1).

ratio of rhAFP/ACA regime was used in comparison to
CDDP treated mice. When a high molar ratio regimen
(≥1:3) was employed, the presence of pulmonary
inflammation and capillary haemorrhaging was noticeable
in both A549 and PC-3 groups (Figure 4A). The activation
of pro-inflammatory signalling in response to rhAFP/ACA
was also found to be consistent with the activation of the
NF-κB pathway, the major transcription factor family
governing inflammatory cytokine responses, as shown
later in Western blotting and IHC analyses. Body weight
loss was apparent only in CDDP-treated mice, while all
rhAFP/ACA treated groups maintained a similar increase
in body weight comparable to placebo groups (Figure 4B).
No other physiological indications on other major organs,
such as liver and kidney were found during necropsy
procedures. It was concluded that the inflammatory and
physiological effects of rhAFP/ACA was somewhat
milder than conventional CDDP drugs, which was likely
attributed to rhAFPs tumour targeting abilities.

Monitoring of treatment effectiveness was also
measured weekly using sandwich ELISA against tumour
antigen markers. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was
used to monitor the development of NSCLC tumours while
prostate specific antigen (PSA) was used for assessing
prostate tumours. In comparison to placebo controls, both
PSA and CEA levels reduced consistently as rhAFP/ACA
molar concentrations increased from 1:1 to 1:5 molar
ratios (Figure 5). Reductions in tumour marker levels were
also found to be short lived, and increased rapidly back
when treatment ceased, consistent with changes in tumour
bulk volume for all treated groups.

rhAFP/ACA complex mediates its anti-cancer
and anti-inflammatory effects through the NF-κB
signalling pathway

p65 complex is the most common and dominant NF-κB
heterodimer form in most cancer types [22]. From IHC
data, p65 (RelA) NF-κB subunit mean protein levels
were found to be highly expressed in tumour tissue from
placebo sections (152.85 to 154.39) and in CDDP treated
sections (150.82 to 153.80) compared to low expression
in ACA treated sections (119.95±14.71), rhAFP treated
sections (139.60±6.42), 1:1 ratio (116.04 to 119.92), 1:3
ratio (118.76 to 119.98) and 1:5 ratio treated sections
(123.03 ± 8.14). Both PC-3 and A549 section indicated
similar reduction patterns in p65 levels as well as other
NF-κB regulated genes following rhAFP/ACA treatment,
thus supporting the occurrence of NF-κB down-regulation
(Figure 6). Overall, similar expression patterns in vitro and
in vivo, as well as between both cancer types demonstrated
that the rhAFP/ACA complex modulates its anti-cancer
effects consistently. It was also interesting to note that
changes in protein levels were most prominent when a 1:1
molar ratio of rhAFP/ACA complex was used.

In previous in vitro analyses, it was reported
that both ACA and rhAFP mediates their anti-cancer
effects through the NF-κB signalling pathway and by
disrupting XIAP-caspase interaction respectively [4,
17]. In order to determine regulation of NF-κB regulated
genes and inflammatory biomarkers, IHC analyses were
carried out on both A549 and PC-3 tumour xenografts
biopsies (Supplementary Figures 2 & 3). In both A549
and PC-3 tumour sections, increases in pro-apoptotic
and cell cycle regulator protein levels were observed
in p21, cleaved caspase-3 and p300, while angiogenic
biomarker vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
inflammatory biomarkers histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2),
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) were significantly reduced compared to placebo
levels (Figure 6). An over expression of HDAC2, COX2 and 5-LOX have been implicated in the growth and
progression of various cancer types, and are also found
to be regulated by the NF-κB pathway [18-20]. Cyclindependent kinase inhibitor, p21 plays an important role
in preventing tumour development, whereby inducing p21
has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest [21]. The p50/

conducted on cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). CDK4 is a catalytic
subunit of the protein kinase complex of the CDK family
that is important for G1 phase cell cycle progression. Over
expression of CDK4 has been shown in many tumour
types including NSCLC, and has been implicated as a
key factor in promoting the initiation and development
of tumours [23-24]. Our results indicated that protein
levels of CDK4 in A549 tumour biopsies were marginally
reduced in ACA treated, rhAFP/ACA 1:3 ratio and rhAFP/
ACA 1:5 ratio groups compared to other treatment groups.

However, in PC-3 tumour biopsies, reduction in CDK4
levels were much more prominent in ACA stand alone
treated, rhAFP/ACA ratio 1:3 and ratio 1:5 treated groups
(Figure 7). MMPs represent the most prominent family of
proteinases associated with tumourigenesis, and have been
implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis. In addition
to their role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix and
cancer cell migration, MMPs regulate signalling pathways
that control cell growth, inflammation, or angiogenesis
and may even work in a non-proteolytic manner. In
tumours, MMP-9 expression has been attributed to

infiltrating inflammatory cells, and is regulated by the
NF-κB pathway [25]. Western blotting data on MMP-9
revealed that placebo treated groups demonstrated the
highest expression levels compared to other treatment
groups in PC-3 tumour biopsies (Figure 7), and that ACA
in combination with rhAFP was capable of inhibiting
cellular migration and invasion (Figures 8 & 9). However,
the same findings in PC-3 cells were not observed in A549
cells, where its migration and invasion properties were
insignificantly affected by rhAFP/ACA treatment. Both

with IHC analyses, confirming that NF-κB regulated genes
were down-regulated upon rhAFP/ACA treatment.

the highest level of receptors, and were almost entirely
absent in non-tumour cells as indicated by anti-AFP-R
IgG binding. This supported the use of rhAFPs to augment
ACA’s specificity towards tumour cells, and to a certain
extent, also explain the reduced side effects observed
in vivo in comparison to ACA and CDDP stand alone
treatments.

DISCUSSION
One of the central challenges of modern-day
chemotherapy is the design of drugs displaying high
selectivity towards tumour cells. In an effort to improve
the efficacy of cytotoxic agents without increasing
the burden of side effects, researchers have developed
strategies to prevent easy diffusion by binding these
toxic drugs to macromolecules, such as antibodies, serum
proteins, lectins, peptides, growth factors and synthetic
polymers. One important aspect that should be taken
into consideration when using these carriers is that the
process of crossing the cell membrane should be made as
specific as possible [26]. Since rhAFP has the ability to
bind various water insoluble small molecules within its
hydrophobic pockets, it is a suitable drug carrier candidate
of ACA. This allowed the solubilisation of ACA in an
aqueous environment corresponding to human blood,
and to function as a targeted delivery vector selectively
to tumour cells whilst avoiding normal healthy tissue.

Efficacy of rhAFP/ACA complex correlates with
AFP-R levels
In order to determine whether the efficacy of
rhAFP/ACA regimes correlate with levels of AFPreceptors on tumour cells, IF-IC analyses were carried
out on two representative NSCLC and prostate cancer cell
lines respectively. Our data suggested a weak negative
correlation between cell viability levels and AFP-R levels
with a correlation coefficient value (R) of -0.57 and R2
value of 0.33 (Figure 10). Additionally, it was found that
AFP-Rs were present at varying levels among tumour
cell types with HepG2 positive control cells indicating

Data from adiabatic scanning microcalorimetry and
thermodynamic parameters provided evidence that the
tertiary structure of the rhAFP molecule is stabilized upon
binding to ACA but undergoes significant destabilization
induced by its removal, hence confirming its reversible
conformational change. It also demonstrates that rhAFP
forms a non-covalent complex with ACA leading to the

formation of a more stable tertiary structure resistant to
heat denaturation. Similarly as previously reported, high
concentrations of hydrophobic ligands such as fatty acids
and estrogens are able to induce multiple conformational
transition forms, but which are reversible, in the tertiary
structure of rhAFP [27]. As this study was carried out with
rhAFP/ACA molar ratios of up to 1:5, it also suggest that

a single rhAFP protein may possess at least five or more
binding sites for ACA on its surface allowing simultaneous
binding of multiple ligands.
While both rhAFP and ACA stand alone regimes
showed tumouricidal effects, their combined use at low
concentrations demonstrated a more significant tumour
suppressive effect. This is advantageous in terms of
addressing dose related toxicity, and is reflected by
increased body weight gains in mice models. Furthermore,
the ability of rhAFP to accumulate at tumour sites has
been recently proven in the past, thus providing highly
specific and effective tumour-suppressive effects [28]. In
the three molar ratios of rhAFP/ACA complex, pulmonary
inflammation was completely absent in the 1:1 ratio,
indicating a reduction in side effects due to rhAFP’s
tumour targeting abilities compared to mice treated with
the commercially available CDDP therapeutic regimen.
In addition to offering potential oxidative susceptibility
protection to ACA via its hydrophobic pockets, rhAFP
also allows for a more specific targeting of cancer cells
by chaperoning ACA towards malignant cells which are
positive for the AFP cell surface receptor. This reduces
the effective dose required in vivo in comparison to
non-specific cytotoxic drugs such as CDDP, therefore
minimizing unnecessary damage towards normal tissue.
Even though in vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that
a 1:5 rhAFP/ACA molar ratio dose induced the highest
level of toxicity, our in vivo studies indicated that a high
1:5 dose resulted in undesired pulmonary inflammatory
side effects. Therefore, on this basis, the recommended
molar combination of this complex is the 1:1 ratio which
indicated the optimum ratio between free hydrophobic
pockets on rhAFP with ACA.
While the innovative use of small molecules
conjugated to AFP was not the first of its kind, it
is important to note that this is the first time that a
recombinant version of human AFP was used. The
employment of AFP as a hydrophobic carrier was
previously demonstrated with doxorubicin using
glutaraldehyde and poly(amidoamine) dendrimers
nanoparticles as a cross-linking agents. It was found
that the anti-tumour activity of doxorubicin included
in the conjugate was significantly higher than that
of free doxorubicin, and was attributed to AFPdoxorubicin’s specificity for tumour cells and also
towards specific features of doxorubicin’s entrance and
compartmentalization into the cell [29].
The NF-κB family is a key player in controlling
both innate and adaptive immunity. Even though NF-κB
activation is required for proper immune system function,
an inappropriate activation or dysregulation of NF-κB
can mediate inflammation and tumourigenesis [30].
High levels of NF-κB pathway activation in tumour cells
typically lead to the enhanced resistance towards apoptosis.
Therefore, any factors capable of producing inhibitory
effects on NF-κB pathway activation are considered as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

potential sensitizing factors for chemotherapeutic drugs. In
our previous study, we have reported that ACA inhibited
both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activation by
preventing IKKα/β phosphorylation and IκBα degradation,
thereby reducing the expressions of NF-κB gene products
such as proinflammatory COX-2 and proliferative
cyclin D1 [4]. In present study, we found that rhAFP/
ACA can mediate anti-tumour activity by modulating
the constitutively active NF-κB subunit, p65, known to
regulate the expression of inflammatory proteins [31].
This showed that ACA’s mode of action in combination
with rhAFP was consistent with our previous in vitro data
where IKK activation was also suppressed by ACA
Invasion and angiogenesis are critical events for
tumour metastasis, and are partly regulated by the NF-κB
pathway. While the extent of angiogenesis and invasion
in vivo were not fully assessed in this study, initial
metastasis biomarkers, such as COX-2, 5-LOX, HDAC2,
VEGF and MMP-9, did reveal that treatment with the
rhAFP/ACA complex successfully down-regulated their
protein levels. The rhAFP/ACA treatment up-regulated
histone acetylase p300 and cell cycle inhibitor p21 protein
expressions while down-regulating histone deacetylase
HDAC2 and cyclin dependent kinase CDK4, all of which
are important cell cycle regulator proteins [32-34]. Since
ACA induces apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway
while rhAFP ultimately affects the intrinsic pathway as
previously described [4, 17], treatment with this complex
would combine these two death pathways as a multimodal
therapy to hypothetically enhance the apoptotic effects
while reducing the likelihood of therapeutic resistance as
seen with single mechanistic drugs such as CDDP.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the novel and improved
pharmaceutical formulation based on tumouricidal
plant-derived compound ACA and rhAFP produced in
S. cerevisiae was described. This advantageous twocomponent, biochemotherapy and non-covalent complex
is recommended for targeting both NSCLC and prostate
cancers, and may be extended towards various other types
of AFP-R positive human tumours.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material
Rhizomes of Alpinia conchigera Griff were
collected from Jeli province of Kelantan, east-coast of
Peninsular Malaysia. The sample was identified by Prof.
Dr. Halijah Ibrahim from the Institute of Biological
Science, Division of Ecology and Biodiversity, Faculty
of Science, University of Malaya. Extraction of ACA

Cell lines and culture conditions

involved solvent extractions, chromatographic methods,
HPLC profiling and NMR structure verification according
to previous methods [3]. A voucher specimen (KL5049)
was deposited in the Herbarium of Chemistry Department,
Faculty of Science, University of Malaya.

Human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (A549
and SK-LU-1), human androgen-independent prostate
cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU 145), human cervical
carcinoma cell (Ca Ski), human oral squamous carcinoma
cell (HSC-4), human hepatocyte carcinoma cell (HepG2)
and normal cell controls human mammary epithelial
cell (HMEC) (Lonza Inc., USA) were used. All the cell
cancer lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) except for SK-LU-1 cell lines was
purchased from Aseacyte, Malaysia. A549, SK-LU-1, Ca
Ski, HSC-4 and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) whereas PC-3 and
DU 145 cells were cultured in Rosewell Park Memorial
Institute 1640 (RPMI) medium supplemented with 10.0%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). While HMEC cells
were cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Medium
(MEGM). All cells were maintained in an incubator at
37oC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 95% humidity level.

Production and isolation of rhAFP
Recombinant human AFP was supplied by Prof. Dr.
Elena Dudich and Dr. Eduard Tatulov from Biological
System LLC, Institute of Immunological Engineering,
Lyubuchany, Moscow, Russia. The production of
glycosylated and non-glycosylated rhAFP secreted by
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was obtained from plasmid
transfection of the AFP gene in yeast cells and also
those produced by genomic integration of the AFP gene.
All corresponding isolation procedures were patented
and reported earlier [11-12]. Pilot scale fermentation of
rhAFP-secreting yeast strains were carried out in a 5.0
L Biostat B (B. Braun Biotech International, Germany)
bioreactor. During fermentation, replenishment with YPG
medium (3% yeast extract, 6% peptone, 10% glucose) was
continuously performed. In the case of culturing in high
density media, the content of rhAFP was quantified using
a modified commercial ELISA kit Cat#K225 (XemaMedica, Moscow, Russia), with yields as high as 100 to
200 mg/L.

Cytotoxic combination effects of rhAFP/ACA
compositions in vitro
Combinations of ACA and rhAFP at various molar
ratios were tested for their killing effects on A549, SKLU-1, PC-3, DU 145, HepG2, Ca Ski, HSC-4 and human
mammary epithelial (HMEC) cells in vitro with the
MTT assay. Both ACA and rhAFP molar concentrations
were optimized to the extent that it would not generate
an extensive cytotoxic effect in stand alone treatment (≤
IC50). Human tumour and normal cells were seeded in 96well plates at a density of 1.0×104 cells per well in 100.0
µl serum free medium for 24 h to allow adherence. Various
combined molar ratios of rhAFP with ACA ranging from
1:1 to 1:5 were prepared and added into each well. After 24
h of incubation, MTT assays were performed to determine
the viability of treated cells. Assessment on the type of
combination relationship was done using an isobologram
analysis, while the degree of synergy was assessed based
on calculated combination index (CI) values, where CI
values of >1.0 implies antagonism, 1.0 implies additivity,
and <1.0 implies synergistic type relationships between
two components. All calculations were based upon the CI
equation adapted from previous literature [16].

Preparation of non-covalent complexes of rhAFP
and ACA
Ligand-free defatted rhAFP was prepared by
charcoal/HCl treatment in 0.1 mM acetate buffer at pH
4.0. Just after absorption, AFP preparation was adjusted
to pH 7.5 by the addition of concentrated 2M Tris buffer
(Bio-Rad, USA) and thereafter dialyzed against phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (MediaTech, USA). Non-covalent
complexes of rhAFP with ACA were prepared by 2 h
incubation of the protein solution in PBS (10.0 mg/
ml) with equimolar amounts of ACA ligands dissolved
in DMSO (Merck, Germany) at either (1:1), (1:3) or
(1:5) at 25⁰C. The rhAFP/ACA complexes were used
for cell culture or microcalorimetry experiments. The
final concentration of polar solvents in cell culture did
not exceed 1% (v/v) and was subtracted as a control in
cell viability experiments. All unbound ligands were
removed by dialysis before microcalorimetry experiments.
Calorimetric measurements were performed using a
differential adiabatic scanning microcalorimetry (DASM)4 differentials capillary scanning calorimeter equipped
with cells of 0.464 ml working volume. Calorimetric
runs of the samples were carried out within a temperature
range of 1 to 100oC at a heating rate of 1.0 K/min. The
specific excess heat capacity function Cp,exe(T) and specific
denaturation heat Qd were calculated as described in [15].

In vivo efficacy of rhAFP/ACA formulations
Six weeks-old male athymic nude mice (Nu/Nu)
(Biolasco Taiwan Co. Ltd., Taiwan) were used to assess
the effects of rhAFP/ACA formulations in vivo. Two
sets of studies to evaluate the formulations’ therapeutic
effects on NSCLC and prostate tumour xenografts were
performed simultaneously. Tumour xenografts were

Matrix HC subcutaneously (s.c.) at the lateral neck region
for the former or the lateral thigh region for the latter
using 25 gauge needles. All drugs were prepared in 0.9%
(w/v) NaCl solution and administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.) when tumour load reached a 100.0 mm3 threshold
or higher. The following treatment groups (n=6) were
assigned: (i) placebo (0.9% NaCl), (ii) CDDP stand alone
(10.0 mg/kg), ACA stand alone (1.56 mg/kg), rhAFP
stand alone (5.0 mg/kg), rhAFP/ACA 1:1 molar ratio
(0.52 mg/kg:5.0 mg/kg), rhAFP/ACA 1:3 molar ratio
(1.56 mg/kg:5.0 mg/kg), and combination rhAFP/ACA
1:5 molar ratio (2.6 mg/kg:5.0 mg/kg). Treatments were
done biweekly with a 2-3 day interval over an 8-week
period inclusive of the tumour induction period. Tumour
volumes were measured with a traceable digital calliper
(Thermo Scientific, USA) by calculating [(major diameter)
× 0.5 × (minor diameter)2] once a week throughout the
entire experiment. Net body weight (minus tumour
weight) was measured concurrently with tumour volume
measurements. Mice were allowed to live an additional 2
weeks post-treatment period to evaluate tumour recurrence
rate. Blood samples were collected via tail vein bleeding
once a week for quantification of tumour markers.
All mice were sacrificed at the end of the study using
purified CO2, and biopsies of tumours were harvested
and fixed in formalin solution. All procedures for animal
experimentation were approved by The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Malaya
[(UM IACUC), ethics reference no: GEN/29/06/2012/
NMA(R)].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of tumour
biopsies
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour
sections were subjected to de-paraffinization and
rehydration using a graded alcohol series (Cell Signalling,
USA). Epitope retrieval was achieved by boiling the tissue
sections in sodium citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) for 10
min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using
3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. All sections were blocked
with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) and 5%
(v/v) normal goat serum (Cell Signalling, USA) for 1 h.
IHC was performed using antibodies specific for NFκB p65 (1:400), COX-2 (1:200), 5-LOX (1:50), VEGF
(1:100), p21 (1:50), cleaved caspase-3 (1:800), HDAC2
(1:100) and p300 (1:100), and incubated overnight at

extracellular matrix, Matrigel. Equal number A549 or
PC-3 cells (1.0 × 105/ml) were seeded in 6-well plates and
were treated with ACA stand alone, rhAFP stand alone,
or combination of rhAFP and ACA for 24 h at 37°C. 24well transparent PET membrane 8.0 μm pore size insets
were coated with 70.0 ul of 1.5 mg/ml Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, USA). Cells were starved with serum free
media and harvested after 20 h. Cells were resuspended
with 500.0 μm of serum free media and were added to
the upper insert, whilst media with 20.0% (v/v) FBS was
added at the lower insert as a chemo-attractant. The cells
were incubated for 24h at 37o C. Cells in the upper insert
were removed with cotton swabs, and invading cells on the
underside of the membrane were fixed in 100.0% ethanol
for 2 min, followed by staining with 1.0% (w/v) methylene
blue (Sigma, USA) for 20 min. Number of invaded cells in
eight random fields of each transwell invasion membrane
insert area were counted under the Nikon Eclipse TS100
inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) at 200× magnification.

Quantification of tumour markers using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were assessed weekly
using sandwich ELISA kit (MP Biomedicals, USA)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, samples
were immobilized with goat antibody (zero buffer)
before addition of monoclonal HRP-conjugated antiPSA IgG or anti-CEA IgG for 2 h at room temperature.
Detection was done using 3,3’,5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) solution in the dark at room temperature for 30
min. Colour development was stopped by adding HCl
stop solution, and absorbance values were measured
spectrophotometrically at 450 nm wavelength. A linear
standard concentration range (0 ng/ml to 120 ng/ml) was
established for both PSA and CEA which was used to
correlate absorbance values to concentration values.

Statistical analysis
Data from all experiments were presented as mean ±
SD of at least three to six replicates. Differences between
samples were considered statistically significant with
p-values ≤ 0.05 as calculated using paired Student’s T-test.

Cell migration was determined using the wound
healing assay. Equal number A549 or PC-3 cells (4.0 ×
105/ml) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated at
37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h in growth media with 10% FBS
(Kansas, USA) media to allow cells to attach onto the
plate to form a monolayer. The growth media was changed
to serum-free medium containing of Mitomycin-C
(Calbiochem, USA) at 1.0 μg/ml and further incubated in
37°C for 2 h to inhibit cell proliferation, before wounds
of similar size were introduced into the monolayer by a
sterile pipette tip. Cell debris generated from the scratch
were washed with 1x PBS twice, and treated with ACA
stand alone, rhAFP stand alone, or combination of rhAFP
and ACA in serum-free medium for 24 h at 37oC. The
images and speed of wound closure was documented at 0
h and 24 h post-wounding using the Nikon Eclipse TS100
inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments,
Japan) and analyzed using TScratch software, Version 1.0
(MathWorks Inc., USA).
