BACKGROUND. Although high-dose therapy is considered the standard therapy for
younger patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the advantages of performing a
second transplant remain debated. The current study was conducted to evaluate
the efficacy and the feasibility of a front-line double transplant program in young
MM patients.

METHODS. A total of 153 MM patients aged 65 years, the majority of whom had
stage III disease (65%), were enrolled in a multicenter, nonrandomized, highdose program including 2 transplants.

RESULTS. The percentage of good quality responses (complete and very good par1

response rate of 29%) after 2 transplants. However, this increase in response did
not produce an advantage in either event-free survival or overall survival, even
was well tolerated and no difference in transplant-related mortality was observed
between the first and second transplants. A first transplant was performed in 122
of 153 patients (80%), and 65 (42% of the enrolled patients) completed the double transplant program. Reasons for not undergoing the second autologous transplant were death (n ¼ 2 patients), insufficient peripheral blood stem cells (n ¼ 8
patients), severe transplant-related toxicity (n ¼ 10 patients), allotransplants
(n ¼ 9 patients), early progression after first transplant (n ¼ 6 patients), lost to
follow-up (n ¼ 3 patients), and patient refusal (n ¼ 19 patients).

CONCLUSIONS. Considering the limited advantage of double transplants, the complexity of the program, the high percentage of dropouts, and the additional costs
of a second transplant, the current study favors single transplant programs
for the treatment of younger MM patients. Cancer 2007;109:2273–8.  2007

igh-dose therapy (HDT) represents the gold standard treatment
for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), but
to our knowledge, there is no definite agreement regarding the need
for a second transplant. Two randomized trials by Attal et al.1 and
Child et al.2 demonstrated a better event-free survival (EFS) and
overall survival (OS) after HDT compared with conventional therapy
(CC). These results have not been confirmed by other trials. Fermand et al.3 and Barlogie et al.4 observed a benefit in terms of EFS,
but no difference in OS between patients treated with HDT and
those treated with CC. In contrast, in the Spanish experience, in

et al.5 confirmed better complete response (CR) rates
with HDT than with CC but found no differences in
terms of EFS and OS between the 2 strategies. Given
the impact of CR on outcome,6 Barlogie et al.7
explored the possibility of further increasing
response rates by intensifying the treatment through
the introduction of a second transplant; the EFS and
OS at 12 years after this Total Therapy I strategy
were found to be better than those after CC.8
Therefore, although there is a general agreement
regarding the treatment of young MM patients with
HDT, it remains unclear whether a second transplant
adds anything to the first procedure. In the IFM94
study, Attal et al.9 found a clear advantage in terms
of EFS and OS after a tandem transplant, with the
best benefit from the second transplant occurring in
patients with less than a good partial response after
the first procedure. Conversely, preliminary results of
other randomized trials did not demonstrate a clear
survival benefit for the patients undergoing double
transplants,10–12 raising the issues of additive costs,
toxicity, and efforts to complete all the scheduled
programs.13–17

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From January 2000 to December 2004, 153 newly
diagnosed MM patients aged 65 years in disease
stages II, III, or I in progression according to the
Durie and Salmon staging system and who were eligible for high-dose therapy were consecutively enrolled in a high-dose chemotherapy program
including 2 tandem autotransplants.
There were 79 males and 74 females with a median age of 55 years (range, 35–65 years); 26 patients
(18%) were in stage I in progression (13 patients progressed from a previous monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance, the remaining 13 patients
had increases of M component and bone marrow
plasma cell infiltration), 24 (17%) were in stage II,
and 103 were in stage III disease (65%). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the patients at the time
of enrollment.

Protocol Outline
The protocol outlined in Figure 1 included: 1) 2
pulse-VAD cycles (combined intravenous bolus of
vincristine [2 mg i.v.] and doxorubicin [5 mg i.v.]

conditioned with melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m2
(HD-MPH), separated by 3 to 6 months. No maintenance was scheduled after the second transplant.

Response Criteria
Response was evaluated as follows: CR required negative immunofixation of urine and serum as well as a
normal bone marrow aspirate; very good partial
remission (VGPR) required at least a 90% decrease of
both the monoclonal component (MC) in serum and
urine and infiltration of bone marrow plasma cells
(BMPC); partial remission (PR) required a minimum
25% decrease of both serum and urine MC and
BMPC infiltration; stable disease indicated a reduction of MC in the serum and urine and/or BMPC
infiltration of <25%; and progression was defined as
the reappearance of MC or BMPC infiltration or as
an MC or BMPC increase of 50% at 2 subsequent
evaluations. CR and VGPR were considered together
as good quality responses; stable disease and progression were considered together as limited disease control. Response rates were evaluated at the end of
each phase.

counts and relative frequencies. Any association
between type of response to the first transplant and
the number of transplants was tested using the chisquare test for tables. The Kaplan-Meier productlimit method was used to estimate survival curves,
and the Gehan Wilcoxon test was adopted to perform
comparisons between different groups of patients.
For each patient, the OS was calculated as the time
between the start of follow-up (either the date of diagnosis or the date of the first transplant) and the
date of death or last follow-up for censored cases.
EFS was calculated as the time between the start of
follow-up and the date of disease progression or
death, or last follow-up for censored cases.

RESULTS
Response
Table 2 reports the responses after each phase
demonstrating that the percentage of good quality
responses (CR1VGPR) improved from the initial
phase to the second transplant procedure, with a
final rate of 91% (CR of 29%) achieved in patients
completing the protocol as planned. At the time of
the current analysis, after a median follow-up of 30
months (range, 3–78 months) the median EFS was 31
months, and the median OS had not yet been
reached (Fig. 2). Patients with less than a PR after
the first transplant (stable disease or progression)
were found to have a worse EFS (P ¼ .001) and OS
(P ¼ .015) compared with patients with at least a PR.
Conversely, no statistically significant differences in
EFS and OS were observed between patients with a
good quality response and those with a PR (Fig. 3A
and 3B). We compared the outcome of patients who
received only 1 transplant (n ¼ 57 patients) with that

ences in the EFS and OS were observed between patients with a good quality response (complete response [CR] and very good partial remission
[VGPR]) and those with a partial response (PR). The EFS and OS were found
to be better in patients who achieved at least a PR compared with patients
with limited disease control (stable disease [SD] and progression [Prog]).

of the patients who completed the double transplant
program (n ¼ 65 patients) as originally planned. The
clinical characteristics and response rates to the first
transplant were comparable between the patients in
the 2 groups (P ¼ .2). The EFS (P ¼ .549) and OS
(P ¼ .228) (Fig. 4A and 4B) were found to be similar
in the 2 groups, even when the analysis was performed according to the type of response reached
after the first transplant.

Feasibility of the Program
Figure 1 shows the patient-flow throughout the protocol and summarizes the reasons for withdrawal at

each step. Among the 153 patients enrolled into this
study, 31 patients (20%) dropped out before the first
transplant. Three patients dropped out after pulseVAD (1 because of progression and 2 were lost to follow-up) and 28 patients dropped out after DCEP for
the following reasons: progression (n ¼ 11 patients),
severe toxicity (n ¼ 1 patient), insufficient PBSC mobilization (n ¼ 7 patients), allogeneic transplant
(n ¼ 4 patients), withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 2
patients), and missing follow-up (n ¼ 3 patients).
In all, 122 patients (80% of the enrolled patients)
entered the transplant phase and of these, only 65
(42% of the enrolled patients) completed the double
transplant program. Reasons for not undergoing the
second autologous transplant were death during the
first procedure (n ¼ 2 patients), insufficient PBSC for
a second transplant (n ¼ 8 patients), severe transplant-related toxicity (n ¼ 10 patients), allogeneic

transplant from a well-matched human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) donor (n ¼ 9 patients), early progression after high-dose melphalan (n ¼ 6 patients),
patient lost to follow-up (n ¼ 3 patients), and patient
refusal of the second transplant (n ¼ 19 patients).

Toxicity
No therapy-related mortality was observed during
the first 2 phases of the program (2 pulse-VAD cycles
and 2 DCEP cycles). The most common adverse
events noted during pulse-VAD were infections (8%),
constipation (4%), and peripheral neuropathy (2%). A
comparable limited toxicity was observed with the
DCEP chemotherapy, with infections occurring in
10% of the patients and nausea and constipation in
<1%.
The transplant-related mortality was limited,
with no difference noted between the 2 transplants;
2 patients died during the first procedure and 1 during the second transplant. Toxicities were the same
during the first and the second transplant procedures: oral mucositis (14%), nausea and emesis (5%),
diarrhea (9%), and infections (7%).

DISCUSSION
The scenario of therapy in MM patients in the last 15
years has been largely influenced by the introduction
of autologous transplantation. Some studies demonstrated a superiority of HDT compared with CC both
in terms of EFS and OS1,2; other experiences3,4 confirmed a better EFS but found no difference in OS
for patients randomly assigned to HDT; and finally,
Blade et al.,5 despite the improved response rate
achieved with HDT, found no difference in outcome
when considering both EFS and OS in terms of transplantation versus CC. Moreover, to our knowledge,
no clear advantage has been shown in performing 2
tandem transplants compared with only 1.7–12 Given
the complexity of an HDT schedule including a double transplant, 1 important emerging issue is to
define patients who could benefit from 2 procedures.
We performed this study on a cohort of 153 MM
patients who were younger than 65 years and were
enrolled in a high-dose program including 2 transplants with the aim of evaluating not only the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy but also its real
feasibility.
In keeping with data in the literature,7–12 the
response rate improved throughout the protocol. In
particular, the percentage of patients who achieved a
CR1VGPR after 1 transplant was 68% (CR rate of
19%) and this figure rose to 91% (CR rate of 29%)
after the second procedure. Nevertheless, these

2277

results did not lead to longer EFS and OS in patients
who received 2 transplants compared with those who
underwent only 1 transplant (Fig. 4), even when the
analysis was performed on the basis of the type of
response after first transplant. These findings are in
contrast with those of other studies reporting an
advantage from performing a second transplant in
those patients not achieving a CR after the first procedure.9,10
Considering the feasibility of this double transplant program, 31 patients (20%) did not reach the
first transplant, mainly because of disease progression or failed collection of PBSC (Fig. 1). This is
consistent with previous studies that reported a comparable withdrawal rate of 20% to 25% due to disease
progression occurring before transplantation.7–11 The
patient flow increased after the first transplant; of
the 122 patients who underwent the first transplant
(80% of those enrolled), only 65 patients (42% of the
enrolled and 53% of those who underwent 1 transplant) underwent the second procedure, revealing
the limiting complexity of the entire program, together with no clear advantage in terms of outcome.
This is in accordance with data previously reported
by Rosinol et al.12 In the PETHEMA experience, only
45% of the patients referred to a tandem transplant
program completed the assigned therapy. Both in our
study and in the Spanish report, the readiness of
patients to interrupt treatment was the most frequent reason for not continuing the program after
the first transplant (Fig. 1). This most likely is due to
the good performance status and the good quality of
life patients usually achieve after the first procedure,
with a consequent refusal to receive further treatment.
In conclusion, although the indication for HDT
in younger patients appears clear, the role of a second transplant remains undefined. The results of the
current study did not demonstrate an advantage
from undergoing a second procedure, independently
of the quality of response obtained with the first
transplant. Therefore, the lack of a clear advantage in
terms of efficacy, the high percentage of dropouts
observed throughout the program, and the additive
toxicity and costs of the second transplant appear to
favor the strategy of a single transplant as the initial
management program in younger MM patients.
