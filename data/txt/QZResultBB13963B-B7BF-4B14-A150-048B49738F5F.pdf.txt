Venous Thromboembolism in the Patient
With Cancer
Focus on Burden of Disease and Benefits of Thromboprophylaxis
Gary H. Lyman, MD, MPH

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. The risk of
VTE varies over the natural history of cancer, with the highest risk occurring during hospitalization and after disease
recurrence. Patient and disease characteristics are associated with further increased risk of VTE in this setting. Specific factors include cancer type (eg, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, lymphoma) and the presence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. VTE is a significant predictor of increased mortality during the first year among all
types and stages of cancer, with metastatic disease reported to be the strongest predictor of mortality. VTE is also
associated with early death in ambulatory patients with cancer. These data highlight the need for close monitoring,
prompt treatment, and appropriate preventive strategies for VTE in patients with cancer. The American Society of
Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have issued guidelines regarding the prophylaxis
and treatment of patients with cancer. This review summarizes the impact of VTE on patients with cancer, the effects
of VTE on clinical outcomes, the importance of thromboprophylaxis in this population, relevant ongoing clinical trials

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a

major complication of cancer and one of the leading causes of death among cancer patients.1,2 Overall, approximately
20% of all VTE cases occur in patients with cancer.3 In addition, VTE affects up to 20% of patients with cancer before
death and has been reported in up to half of cancer patients at the time of postmortem examination, highlighting the fact
that the true extent of this complication may be underestimated.4,5 Cancer-associated VTE has important clinical and economic consequences, including increased morbidity resulting from hospitalization and anticoagulation use, bleeding complications, increased risk of recurrent VTE, and cancer treatment delays.6 In 1 analysis, Prandoni et al reported that
patients with cancer and VTE were approximately 4 times more likely to develop recurrent thromboembolic complications and twice as likely to develop major bleeding while receiving anticoagulant treatment than those without malignancy.7 The occurrence of VTE in patients with cancer may interfere with planned chemotherapy regimens, worsen
patient quality of life,8 and lead to the increased consumption of healthcare resources compared with patients without cancer who experience VTE. In a retrospective study of medical records from 529 cancer patients, the mean hospitalization
cost for DVT was $20,065 per episode (2002 US$)9 compared with a cost of $7712 to $10,804 per episode in a general
medical population with VTE.10
VTE is also associated with increased mortality in cancer patients. A retrospective study by Khorana et al found that
in-hospital mortality was 2-fold to 5-fold more common in neutropenic cancer patients hospitalized with thromboembolism compared with those without thromboembolism.11 Similarly, Chew et al determined that the diagnosis of VTE was
a significant predictor of increased mortality during the first year among all cancer types examined, with hazard ratios
(HRs) ranging from 1.6 to 4.2 (P < .01).12 The strongest predictor of death in this analysis was metastatic disease at the

time of cancer diagnosis, with an HR ranging from 1.8 to
49.0 (P < .001). In addition, stratified analyses demonstrated that VTE was associated with an increased risk of
death for patients with all stages and cancer types, with a
median overall relative risk (RR) of 3.7 (Table 1).12 A prospective study of patients initiating new chemotherapy
(median follow-up, 75 days) found that VTE accounted
for 9.2% of deaths.1 In addition, a VTE diagnosis has been
associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of
death within 2 years in patients with breast cancer.13
Taken together, these data highlight the need for
close monitoring, prompt treatment, and appropriate preventive strategies for VTE in patients with cancer. This
review will describe the substantial impact of VTE on
patients with cancer, the effects of VTE on clinical outcomes, the importance of thromboprophylaxis in this
population, relevant ongoing clinical trial data, and new
pharmacologic treatment options for the prevention of
VTE.

RISK OF VTE IN PATIENTS WITH
CANCER
In addition to the overall increased risk of VTE among
patients with cancer, VTE risk is especially high among
certain subgroups, such as hospitalized patients, those
undergoing active antineoplastic therapy, and those with

metastatic disease.14 Cancer patients undergoing major
surgery are also at an increased risk of VTE.15,16 Other
factors that have been associated with increased risk
include patient characteristics such as advanced age, ethnicity, and gender; cancer-related factors including cancer
type and disease stage; the presence of specific biomarkers
such as tissue factor and D-dimer; and factors related
to systemic treatment such as type of therapeutic agent
(Table 2).14
The presence of metastatic disease is strongly associated with an increased risk of VTE. An analysis of the California Cancer Registry found that the incidence of VTE
varied with cancer type, but regardless of cancer type, the
incidence was highest among patients initially diagnosed
with metastatic disease.12 Among patients with concurrent VTE, 56% had metastatic disease compared with
21% of patients without concurrent VTE (P < .001).
Conversely, patients with metastatic disease at the time of
cancer diagnosis had a 1.4-fold to 21.5-fold higher risk of

thromboembolism than patients with localized disease for
all cancer types analyzed.12
The risk of VTE varies over the natural history of
cancer, with the highest risk occurring during hospitalization and after the development of metastatic disease (Fig.
1).17 In 1 study of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma
and VTE, thrombosis was present at the time of diagnosis
in 37%, occurred during the first chemotherapy cycle in
22%, and occurred overall within the first 3 cycles in 82%
of patients.18 Another study found that the incidence of
thromboembolism was higher during the first year of follow-up than during the second year for all types and stages
of cancer, with the exception of localized pancreatic cancer.12 Similarly, in a study by Alcalay et al of patients with
regional stage colon cancer, the 2-year cumulative incidence of VTE was 3.1%, but the incidence decreased significantly over time from 5.0% during the first 6 months
to 1.4% from 6 months to 1 year. During the second year,
the incidence had decreased further to 0.6%.19
VTE Risk and Cancer Type
The incidence of VTE may be closely associated with
characteristics of tumor biology (not only the extent of
metastatic spread, but primarily the rate of growth and
spread of the cancer), suggesting that specific cancer types
are associated with an increased risk of VTE.
Sites of cancer with the highest rates of VTE include
the pancreas (8.1%), kidneys (5.6%), ovaries (5.6%),
lungs (5.1%), and stomach (4.9%).20 Among the hematologic malignancies, myeloma (5%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.8%), and Hodgkin disease (4.6%) were
reported to have the highest rates of VTE.20 One retro-

1336

spective record review estimated a cumulative frequency
of VTE in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of
12.8%.18
In an analysis of data from the National Hospital
Discharge Survey, the highest incidence of VTE among
19 cancer types included in the analysis occurred in
patients with pancreatic cancer (4.3%), whereas the lowest
evaluable incidence was noted in patients with bladder
cancer (1.0%).21 In neutropenic cancer patients hospitalized with thromboembolism, Khorana et al reported that
the sites of cancer with the highest percentage of patients
with VTE were the pancreas (12.1%), brain (9.5%), and
endometrium or cervix (9%).11 The risk in hospitalized
patients with hematologic disorders was also high;
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia
accounted for greater than one-third of all patients with
venous events.11 Similarly, a large retrospective cohort
study using the discharge database of the University
HealthSystem Consortium (N ¼ 1,015,598 cancer
patients)20 found that 4.1% of patients were diagnosed
with VTE. Factors associated with increased risk included
black ethnicity and the use of chemotherapy.
VTE Risk and Systemic Cancer Therapy
Many cancer therapies (including surgery, chemotherapy,
and hormonal therapy) appear to place patients with cancer at further increased risk of VTE. This appears to also
be true of several newer cancer treatments, such as the
antiangiogenesis agents thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
bevacizumab.4 The use of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent with antiangiogenic activity, has been
associated with an increased risk of VTE when used concomitantly with chemotherapy or dexamethasone in
patients with multiple myeloma.4 In a study presented at
the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in 2008, Gray et al characterized the incidence of
VTE in 3977 patients with multiple myeloma as well as a
variety of solid tumors in a meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials.22 The overall incidence of VTE in
the study was 11.7%, and patients treated with thalidomide were found to be at more than a 2-fold increased
risk of VTE compared with controls (P < .001). The risk
was especially high in patients with multiple myeloma,
with approximately 15% of patients experiencing VTE
and having a 3-fold increased risk compared with control
patients not receiving thalidomide.22
Lenalidomide, a structural analog of thalidomide,
was not found to be associated with an increased risk of
VTE in a postmarketing survey of patients with

myelodysplastic syndromes. In this survey, the observed
risk of VTE was increased in patients treated with lenalidomide and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs);
there was no increase in VTE risk observed in patients
treated with lenalidomide without ESAs.23 According to
the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommendations for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in
patients with cancer, patients receiving thalidomide or
lenalidomide with chemotherapy or dexamethasone warrant prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) or adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] of approximately 1.5).4 As more
agents with antiangiogenic activity become indicated for
the treatment of cancer, it will be important to consider
this risk in cancer patients, especially in those already at
increased risk from other factors.
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed toward vascular endothelial growth factor that has an antiangiogenic effect. Currently, its role in the prevention of
VTE is controversial. Bevacizumab has demonstrated a
survival benefit in combination with chemotherapy in
patients with colorectal cancer and with nonsquamous
cell lung cancer.24 Scappaticci et al conducted a post hoc
analysis of pooled data from randomized controlled trials
evaluating combination treatment with bevacizumab and
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in 1745
patients with colorectal, breast, or nonsmall cell lung cancer. Compared with chemotherapy alone, bevacizumab
was associated with a 2-fold increase in arterial thromboembolic events (P ¼ .031) but was not found to be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events.24 These data are in contrast to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Nalluri et al, which
included a total of 7956 patients with a variety of
advanced solid tumors from 15 randomized controlled
trials. Results indicated that bevacizumab was associated
with an increased risk of VTE, with an RR of 1.33 (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13-1.56 [P < .001])
compared with controls.25
In addition to antineoplastic therapies, certain supportive care measures used in cancer treatment appear to
increase the risk of VTE. The use of epoetin a and darbepoetin a for managing anemia in patients undergoing
cancer treatment has been associated with thromboembolic complications. Bohlius et al conducted a meta-analysis of 35 studies and reported that treatment with
epoetin or darbepoetin increased the risk of thromboembolic events by approximately 67% compared with control patients not receiving these agents (RR, 1.67; 95%
CI, 1.35-2.06).26

In addition, red blood cell transfusions may increase
the risk of VTE. One study of patients receiving transfusions reported that 7.2% of patients developed VTE and
5.2% developed arterial thromboembolism compared
with 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively, of patients who did
not receive transfusions. Transfusions were also found to
be associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.29-1.38]).27

Clinical Risk Model for ChemotherapyAssociated VTE
Recently, a simple model for predicting chemotherapyassociated VTE was developed and validated to assist in
the assessment of VTE risk in ambulatory cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy.28 A total of 2701 patients in
the derivation cohort and 1365 patients in the validation
cohort were included. Five clinical and laboratory parameters were found to independently predict symptomatic
VTE in cancer patients starting a new chemotherapy
regimen.28 These parameters were combined into a risk
assessment model that allowed the classification of
patients into 3 groups based on risk factors: 1) site of cancer (very high risk: stomach and pancreas; high risk: lung,
lymphoma, gynecologic, bladder, and testicular); 2) prechemotherapy platelet count of 350 109/L; 3) hemoglobin levels <100 g/L or the use of red cell growth
factors; 4) prechemotherapy leukocyte count >11 109/L;
and 5) body mass index 35 kg/m2.28 VTE risk score categories using this model have been found to correlate with
the development of VTE and with overall survival in
patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.29

THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS IN CANCER
PATIENTS
Key Clinical Trials of Pharmacologic Agents
Pharmacologic prophylactic options for VTE consist of
unfractionated heparin (UFH), the class of LMWHs, fondaparinux (an indirect inhibitor of activated factor Xa),
and the vitamin K antagonists.4,30 Several novel agents are
also currently in development. The pharmacologic anticoagulant agents currently being evaluated in cancer patients
in phase 2 or phase 3 trials are provided in Table 3. The
results of selected key studies of pharmacologic anticoagulants in cancer patients are discussed below, and an overview of recently published clinical studies is presented in

Key Studies in Surgical Cancer Patients
LMWHs, including enoxaparin, dalteparin, and tinzaparin, are available in the United States for use in thromboprophylaxis.56 ENOXACAN I and II were large
randomized trials evaluating enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients. In ENOXACAN I, enoxaparin
was compared directly with UFH for its ability to prevent
DVT in 631 patients undergoing elective cancer surgery.57 Overall, 16.5% of patients developed thromboembolic complications, with no statistically significant
difference noted between the 2 groups. There were also no
significant differences noted with regard to bleeding
events, other complications, and mortality. The ENOXACAN II study evaluated the duration of prophylaxis for
VTE with enoxaparin in cancer patients after surgery for
cancer. Enoxaparin was given for approximately 1 week
(range, 6-10 days), and patients were thereafter randomized to receive enoxaparin or placebo for an additional 21
days, for a total treatment duration of approximately 1
month. Patients receiving enoxaparin for 1 month were
found to have a significantly reduced incidence of thrombosis compared with those receiving enoxaparin given for
1 week followed by placebo.58 The rates of VTE were
12.0% in the placebo group and 4.8% in the enoxaparin
group, corresponding to a reduction in RR of 60% (P ¼
.02). There were no significant differences noted with
regard to the rates of bleeding or other complications
during the study.58
Key Studies in Hospitalized Cancer Patients
Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to decrease DVT,
specifically in high-risk hospitalized patients. Key trials
include a study comparing enoxaparin with placebo for
the prevention of VTE in acutely ill medical patients
(MEDENOX).59 In that study, prophylactic treatment
with a dose of 40 mg per day of subcutaneous enoxaparin
safely reduced the risk of VTE in patients with acute medical illnesses including cancer, with no difference in the
rates of adverse events reported between the active comparator and placebo. Similarly, dalteparin at a dose of
5000 IU once daily was shown in the PREVENT (Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism) trial to
reduce the risk of VTE in acutely ill medical patients, with
a low overall incidence of major bleeding.60 Comparable
results to LMWH have been reported with fondaparinux
in the ARTEMIS trial, in which fondaparinux (at a dose
of 2.5 mg subcutaneously for 6-14 days) was found to be
effective in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic
VTE in older acute medical patients.61 VTE was detected

Cancer

April 1, 2011

in 5.6% (18 of 321 patients) of patients treated with fondaparinux and 10.5% (34 of 323 patients) of patients
given placebo, with a RR reduction of 46.7% (95% CI,
7.7% to 69.3%). Symptomatic VTE occurred in 5
patients in the placebo group and none of the patients in
the fondaparinux group (P ¼ .029). The frequency of
major bleeding was similar for both fondaparinux and placebo, with major bleeding occurring in 1 patient (0.2%)
in each group.61
Key Studies in Ambulatory Cancer Patients
Several randomized controlled trials of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients have been reported.62
The PROSPECT-CONKO 004 study (a prospective,
randomized trial in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy and also receiving enoxaparin) compared concomitant treatment using enoxaparin with no
anticoagulation in 312 patients. Within the first 12 weeks,
enoxaparin at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was found to be associated with a RR reduction in the incidence of clinically
relevant VTE of 65% (from 14.5% to 5%). Preliminary
data demonstrated no differences between the observational and enoxaparin groups with regard to the secondary
endpoints of time to disease progression (19 weeks vs 22
weeks, respectively) and overall survival (29 weeks vs 31
weeks, respectively). In addition, there was no increased
risk of bleeding events noted with the use of enoxaparin in
this setting (observational, 9.9% and enoxaparin, 6.3%; P
value not significant).63
In the FAMOUS (Fragmin Advanced Malignancy
Outcome Study) trial, dalteparin at a dose of 5000 IU
daily was not found to have a significant impact on the
risk of VTE compared with placebo in patients with
advanced cancer.64 Dalteparin has also been compared
with placebo in 186 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma (PRODIGE).65 Patients received dalteparin
subcutaneously once daily for 6 months, starting within
the first month of surgery. Twenty-two patients developed VTE during the first 6 months: 9 patients receiving
dalteparin and 13 receiving placebo (HR, 0.51, 95% CI,
0.19-1.4 [P ¼ .29]). Over 12 months there were 5 (5.1%)
major bleeding events with dalteparin (all intracranial),
and 1 (1.2%) with placebo (HR, 4.2, 95% CI, 0.48-36 [P
¼ .22]). Survival was comparable between treatment
arms. A randomized controlled trial of dalteparin prophylaxis in patients with solid tumors performed by Sideras et
al found no survival benefit in 141 patients with advanced
cancer who were treated with daily injections of 5000 U
of dalteparin compared with placebo.66 A randomized

1343

Review Article

controlled clinical trial of dalteparin in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer (the UK FRAGEM study)
reported a significant reduction in the risk of VTE (RR,
0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.84 [P < .02]).67 Although dalteparin was administered at weight-adjusted doses of 200
IU/kg/day for 4 weeks followed by 150 IU/kg/day for 8
additional weeks, no increase in major bleeding was
observed.
The LMWH nadroparin was found to reduce the
incidence of thromboembolic events in ambulatory cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy.52 The PROTECHT
(Prophylaxis of Thromboembolism During Chemotherapy) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of
nadroparin versus placebo for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in 1166 patients receiving chemotherapy for
advanced cancer. Patients had metastatic or locally
advanced lung, breast, gastrointestinal, ovarian, or head
and neck cancer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 2. Of the 769 patients
treated with nadroparin, 2.0% had a thromboembolic
event compared with 3.9% of patients receiving placebo
(P ¼ .02), although the difference for VTE did not reach
statistical significance. The incidence of minor bleeding
in the nadroparin group (<8%) was comparable to that of
the placebo group.
Certoparin, another LMWH, has been evaluated in
2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (TOPIC-1
and TOPIC-2) that randomized patients with advanced
breast cancer (N ¼ 353) or nonsmall cell lung cancer (N
¼ 547) to receive certoparin at a dose of 3000 U daily or
placebo for the prevention of chemotherapy-associated
VTE.68 The overall rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic thrombosis in breast cancer patients was 4% for certoparin and 3.9% for placebo. Rates of major bleeding
complications over 6 months of therapy were 1.7% for
certoparin and 0% for placebo. Rates of thrombosis were
higher in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer compared with rates in breast cancer patients and demonstrated a trend toward a reduction in thrombosis with
certoparin (4.5% vs 8.3% for placebo; P ¼ .07). Certoparin was especially effective in patients with stage IV disease (3.5% vs 10.1% for placebo; P ¼ .03).
Taken together, the findings of these trials of
LMWHs in the ambulatory cancer care setting suggest
that these agents have the most benefit in patients at high
risk of VTE, such as those with pancreatic cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials enrolling ambulatory cancer patients

1344

indicated a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of
thromboprophylaxis in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer.62
Impact of Anticoagulants on Cancer
Patient Survival
Anticoagulants have been postulated to improve survival
in cancer patients.69 In a systematic review identifying 11
randomized controlled trials, anticoagulants (particularly
LMWH) demonstrated significantly improved survival at
1 year in cancer patients without VTE while increasing
the risk for bleeding complications.70 Improved survival
with anticoagulation may be dependent on tumor type
and disease stage. The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of prophylactic LMWHs in ambulatory cancer patients found no evidence of a survival benefit with
the use of these agents in this setting.62 Given the limitations of available data, the use of anticoagulants as
antineoplastic therapy cannot be recommended until
additional randomized controlled trials have been conducted. Several trials are currently ongoing to test the
effects of LMWH on survival in patients with cancer.71
Current ASCO and National Comprehensive
Cancer Network Guideline Recommendations
ASCO4 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),30 among other professional organizations, have developed guidelines for VTE prophylaxis and
treatment in patients with cancer. As summarized in these
guidelines, the primary goal of thromboprophylaxis in
patients with cancer is to prevent VTE, including PE and
early death from these complications. Both guidelines
support the use of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in
hospitalized cancer patients unless contraindications to
prophylactic anticoagulation are present. It must be
acknowledged, however, that these recommendations are
based on studies of seriously ill medical patients, only a
small subgroup of which were actually cancer patients.
Although guideline panels and most clinicians have found
it reasonable to extrapolate the results of these studies to
the cancer population, more direct evidence on the risk of
VTE in hospitalized cancer patients is needed.
In addition to cancer patients hospitalized for medical care, prophylaxis should include cancer patients
undergoing major surgery and those with cancer and
established VTE to prevent recurrence of thromboembolic events. According to the ASCO guidelines, low-dose
UFH or LMWH is the recommended prophylaxis in
patients undergoing laparotomy, laparoscopy, or

Cancer

April 1, 2011

Thromboprophylaxis in Cancer Patients/Lyman

thoracotomy.4 Prophylaxis should be initiated before surgery or as early as possible in the postoperative period and
be continued for at least 7 to 10 days after surgery. Prophylaxis may be prolonged for up to 4 weeks in obese patients,
patients undergoing major abdominal or pelvic surgery for
cancer, and patients with a history of VTE. Mechanical
methods of VTE prophylaxis may be used with pharmacologic anticoagulation but should not be used alone except
in patients with active bleeding, for whom the medications
are contraindicated.4 Treatment with LMWH is preferred
in cancer patients with established VTE for the initial 5 to
10 days of treatment and should be given up to 6 months
or longer to prevent VTE recurrence. Vitamin K antagonists with a targeted INR of 2 to 3 are acceptable for
extended secondary prophylaxis when LMWH is not
available. Indefinite anticoagulant therapy should be considered for patients with active cancer.
Routine thromboprophylaxis is currently not recommended in ambulatory patients with cancer who are
receiving systemic chemotherapy because of the lower risk
of VTE in this setting along with an increased risk of
major bleeding in these patients.4 However, ASCO guidelines recommend anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis,
specifically in patients receiving thalidomide or lenalidomide adjunctively with chemotherapy or dexamethasone
because of the high risk of thrombosis associated with
these treatment regimens.4 The evaluation of various biomarkers to enhance clinical prediction tools for the identification of cancer patients at increased risk of VTE who
may benefit from thromboprophylaxis is an area of active
investigation.72-74 Current studies of VTE prophylaxis in
ambulatory cancer patients at high risk for VTE based on
cancer type (eg, pancreatic cancer or risk model evaluation) may lead to future recommendations for prophylaxis
in such settings.
The NCCN guidelines recommend LMWHs, fondaparinux, or UFHs for the acute treatment of VTE while
the diagnosis and risk are being assessed, with LMWHs
preferred in patients who are expected to receive chronic
anticoagulation therapy. Warfarin can be used in patients
requiring chronic anticoagulation but should be initiated
in a 5-day to 7-day transition period with the LMWH,
fondaparinux, or UFHs and be monitored to INR.30 The
guidelines state that LMWHs such as enoxaparin, dalteparin, and tinzaparin are commonly considered therapeutically equivalent, but each has distinct pharmacokinetics
and few clinical studies to date have directly compared the
clinical effects of these agents.30 LMWH as monotherapy
(without warfarin) is recommended for the treatment of

Cancer

proximal DVT or PE and the prevention of recurrent
VTE in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.30
Indefinite anticoagulation should be considered if cancer
is active or important risk factors are persistent.30
There are few data regarding the impact of thrombosis on quality of life in cancer patients. Likewise, the
impact of VTE on the delivery of optimal cancer treatment has received little attention. The prospective international Prospective Registry of Cancer and Events
Involving Thromboembolism (PERCEIVE) Registry is
designed to study the extent to which VTE complicates
the course of common solid tumor malignancies and subsequent clinical outcomes.75 In addition, a prospective,
randomized clinical trial will compare the safety and efficacy of LMWH prophylaxis (dalteparin) versus no treatment in reducing VTE in high-risk ambulatory cancer
patients initiating chemotherapy.76
Representatives of the major international guidelines panels have recently issued a call to action for improved
treatment and prevention strategies as well as a sustained
research effort to further our understanding of the relation
between cancer and thrombosis to reduce the burden of
VTE and its consequences in patients with cancer.77
New Pharmacologic Options for the
Treatment and Prevention of VTE
The evaluation of new anticoagulants is important to
enhance the treatment options available for patients with
cancer. New agents for the pharmacologic treatment and
prevention of VTE include the parenteral agents bemiparin and semuloparin, as well as the oral agents rivaroxaban and apixaban. It is anticipated that oral agents may
provide greater convenience of administration, whereas
parenteral agents continue to be more suitable in the hospital setting for patients undergoing active cancer treatment,
as well as for some patients with advanced malignancy.
Bemiparin

Bemiparin, a LMWH with anti-factor Xa/anti-factor IIa activity,78 has been studied for the prevention of
VTE with prolonged use in cancer patients undergoing
abdominal or pelvic surgery.79 In the CANBESURE
(Cancer, Bemiparin and Surgery Evaluation) study, Kakkar et al randomized 703 cancer surgery patients to receive
once-daily subcutaneous injections of bemiparin at a dose
of 3500 IU (with the first dose administered 6 hours after
surgery) for approximately 1 week. Patients were then
randomized to receive bemiparin or placebo for an additional 3 weeks. Major VTE (composite of proximal DVT,

1345

Review Article

nonfatal PE, and VTE-related deaths) occurred in 0.4%
of patients in the bemiparin group compared with 3.3%
in the placebo group (RR reduction, 87.9%; 95% CI, 98.5%,
4.0% [P ¼ .016]). Bemiparin was found to significantly
reduce the rate of major VTE without significantly increasing
the risk of hemorrhagic complications compared with 1 week
of bemiparin prophylaxis and subsequent placebo.79
Semuloparin

Semuloparin, another parenteral agent, is a subcutaneous ultra-LMWH that acts as a factor Xa inhibitor with residual anti-factor IIa activity.80,81 Semuloparin is being
studied for VTE prevention in patients with cancer as well
as in patients undergoing major abdominal or orthopedic
surgery.82 The dose response of semuloparin was recently
examined in patients undergoing total knee replacement
surgery (TREK study).80 There was a significant dose
response across the 5 semuloparin doses tested, with the
incidence of VTE ranging from 5.3% (dose of 60 mg/day)
to 44.1% (dose of 10 mg/day) for semuloparin. The 3 highest doses of semuloparin (20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, and 60
mg/day) were found to be significantly more effective at
reducing confirmed VTE compared with 40 mg/day of
enoxaparin (used as calibrator), reducing the risk of VTE by
58%, 61%, and 85%, respectively. Six patients in the semuloparin groups (4 in the 60-mg group, 1 in the 40-mg
group, and 1 in the 20-mg group) experienced major bleeding compared with none in the enoxaparin calibrator group.
The 20-mg dose was selected for further investigation and
currently is being studied in several ongoing phase 3 trials.
Two of these trials are studying semuloparin use in cancer
patients. The SAVE-ONCO (Evaluation of AVE5026 in
the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Cancer
Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy) trial is evaluating
semuloparin for the prevention of VTE in cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy (NCT00694382).83 The SAVEABDO (Evaluation of AVE5026 as Compared to Enoxaparin for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in
Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery) trial
(NCT00679588) is evaluating semuloparin compared with
enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing major surgery of the abdomen and/or pelvis, and
includes patients undergoing cancer surgery.84
Rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban is an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa85
and currently is being studied for the prevention of DVT
and PE in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement
(Regulation of Coagulation in Major Orthopedic Surgery

1346

Reducing the Risk of DVT and PE [RECORD] 1-4 trials).86 The Venous Thromboembolic Event Prophylaxis
in Medically Ill Patients (MAGELLAN) trial will evaluate
whether extended therapy with oral rivaroxaban can prevent blood clots in the leg and lung that can occur in
patients hospitalized for acute illness (including active
cancer patients); results will be compared with a standard
regimen of enoxaparin.87
Apixaban

Apixaban is another oral direct inhibitor of factor
Xa. As demonstrated in an interim analysis of a phase 2
study, apixaban was found to be well tolerated in patients
with metastatic cancer. The incidences of major bleeding
and thrombosis among 125 patients were very low (major
bleeding reported in 2 patients receiving apixaban at a
dose of 20 mg and 1 patient receiving placebo; thrombosis
was reported in 3 cases in the placebo group).88

DISCUSSION
VTE is a common complication of cancer and cancer
treatment and is associated with considerable morbidity
and mortality. Hospitalized medical and surgical patients
with cancer are at an increased risk of VTE and should be
considered for pharmacologic prophylaxis if no contraindication to anticoagulation is present.
Patients with cancer who are treated for documented
VTE should be considered for continued anticoagulation,
preferably with LMWH, for up to 6 months or longer in
the presence of active malignancy. Routine thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer is not currently recommended. Nevertheless, many ambulatory
cancer patients are also at an increased risk of thrombosis.
Although results from randomized controlled trials are
still needed, thromboprophylaxis may be considered in
selected high-risk patients, such as those with multiple
myeloma who are receiving thalidomide or lenalidomide
plus chemotherapy. Consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with cancer must always balance the
risk of VTE with the increased risk of bleeding. Improved
methods for the identification of ambulatory patients
with cancer who are at an increased risk of VTE, including
assessing clinical risk factors and using biomarkers, are
currently under investigation and should enable safe,
effective, and targeted thromboprophylaxis.
