BACKGROUND: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a subtype of endometrial cancer associated with chemoresistance and poor outcome. Overexpression of tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein has been linked to paclitaxel resistance in many cancers but has been undercharacterized among USCs. Epothilones have demonstrated activity in certain paclitaxel-resistant malignancies. In this study,
relationships are clarified, in USCs relative to ovarian serous carcinomas (OSCs), between tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein expression,
clinical outcome, and in vitro chemoresponsiveness to epothilone B, ixabepilone, and paclitaxel. METHODS: Tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 48 fresh-frozen tissue samples and 13 cell lines. Copy number was
correlated with immunohistochemistry and overall survival. Median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined using viability and
metabolic assays. Impact of tubulin-b-III knockdown on IC50 was assessed with small interfering RNAs. RESULTS: USC overexpressed
tubulin-b-III but not p-glycoprotein relative to OSC in both fresh-frozen tissues (552.9 6 106.7 versus 202.0 6 43.99, P 5.01) and cell
lines (1701.0 6 376.4 versus 645.1 6 157.9, P 5.02). Tubulin-b-III immunohistochemistry reflected quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction copy number and overexpression stratified patients by overall survival (copy number  400: 615 days; copy number > 400:
165 days, P 5.049); p-glycoprotein did not predict clinical outcome. USCs remained exquisitely sensitive to patupilone in vitro despite
tubulin-b-III overexpression (IC50,USC 0.245 6 0.11 nM versus IC50,OSC 1.01 6 0.13 nM, P 5.006). CONCLUSIONS: Tubulin-b-III overexpression in USCs discriminates poor prognosis, serves as a marker for sensitivity to epothilones, and may contribute to paclitaxel resistance. Immunohistochemistry reliably identifies tumors with overexpression of tubulin-b-III, and a subset of individuals likely to
respond to patupilone and ixabepilone. Epothilones warrant clinical investigation for treatment of USCs. Cancer 2013;119:2582-92.

INTRODUCTION
In 2012, a projected 29,520 deaths will occur from gynecologic malignancies.1 Among gynecologic cancers, endometrial cancer is the most common and may be broadly dichotomized into 2 classes with separate underlying molecular pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and histopathology.2 Type I endometrial cancers comprise 80% of cases,
and are associated with endometrioid histology (grade 1 or 2) and favorable prognosis.3 Type II endometrial cancers are characterized by an aggressive clinical course with relatively poor prognosis.3,4 Uterine serous carcinomas
(USCs) represent the most common form of type II disease and are poorly differentiated by definition. As many
as 37% to 70% of patients with USC demonstrate extrauterine disease at time of diagnosis,5,6 sometimes in the
setting of scant or no myometrial invasion.7,8 Thus, whereas USC represents only 10% of all uterine cancers, it
accounts for 39% of deaths.3
Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States and most developed countries.1,9 Among epithelial subtypes, ovarian serous carcinomas (OSCs) represent 75% of all cases and can be
organized into 2 tiers.10 Low-grade OSCs develop indolently from noninvasive borderline precursors.11 The origin of
high-grade OSCs is more controversial; genetic analyses suggest that rapid transformation of intraepithelial carcinoma of
the fallopian tube may underlie as many as 50% of cases, in addition to those which evolve primarily from peritoneal or

ovarian surface epithelium.7 OSC has one of the highest
death-to-incidence ratios, attributable largely to a lack of
effective screening modalities with subsequent initial diagnosis at late stages.
High-grade serous carcinomas of the uterus and
ovary may be morphologically indistinguishable.8
Advanced-stage disease is associated with grim 5-year
overall survival (OS) rates of 18.5% to 32.5%5 for uterus
and 34%11 for ovary. Although a growing body of molecular evidence delineates the distinctness of these entities,12,13 first-line therapy for both begins with surgical
staging followed by platinum/taxane combination chemotherapy for advanced disease.14-17 Initial response rates of
advanced USC to this regimen are as low as 60%,18 which
compare unfavorably to rates of 80% for OSC.19
Responses in USC are generally nondurable.20 In patients
treated with intravenous carboplatin/paclitaxel for
advanced disease, median progression-free survival in
USC is 13 months,17 compared with 20.7 months in
OSC.15
Resistance to paclitaxel has been linked to overexpression of class III b-tubulin,21 one of 9 b-isoforms22
capable of heterodimerizing with a subunits to form
microtubules critical to cell division. Paclitaxel binds
preferentially to the tubulin-b-I isoform,23 which differs from tubulin-b-III at paclitaxel-binding site positions 275 (Ser!Ala) and 364-365 (Ala-Val!SerSer).22 High tubulin-b-III expression reduces the rate
of microtubule assembly24 and correlates with poorer
OS in ovarian serous,25 colon,26 non-small cell lung,27
and breast28 cancers. This clinicopathologic association
has not yet been demonstrated in endometrial
cancers.29
Epothilones (EPOxide THIazoLe ketONEs) are
novel microtubule-stabilizing macrolides isolated from
Sorangium cellulosum30 with activity in paclitaxel-resistant malignancies putatively due to their unique ability
to bind class III and I isoforms with at least equal affinity.23 Epothilones generally do not share with paclitaxel overlapping mechanisms of resistance,31 and are
not substrates for the drug efflux pump p-glycoprotein,
the overexpression of which has been linked to multidrug resistance to cytotoxic agents, including taxanes.32
Despite encouraging in vitro data and strong biologic
plausibility, p-glycoprotein expression often does not
reliably correlate with clinical outcome, and trials of pglycoprotein inhibitors have failed to demonstrate
improved survival benefit.33 This underscores the need
to identify novel biomarkers that predict clinical
response.

In this study, we sought to 1) quantify by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein expression in a large
number of USC in comparison with high-grade OSC
within solid tissues and cell lines, 2) describe the association of tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein with in vitro
chemoresponsiveness to epothilone B (patupilone), ixabepilone, and paclitaxel, 3) characterize the contribution
of tubulin-b-III to paclitaxel resistance, 4) correlate
tubulin-b-III immunohistochemistry (IHC) with qRTPCR copy number, and 5) examine the prognostic implications of tubulin-b-III overexpression on clinical
outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Procurement, Establishment of Cell
Lines, and Characterization of Growth Rate

As approved by the institutional review boards at Yale
University and the University of Arkansas, fresh-frozen
tissues and patient characteristics were obtained at time of
primary debulking. Tumors were staged according to criteria established by the American Joint Commission on
Cancer 7th edition/FIGO (International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics) guidelines. As per World
Health Organization guidelines for epithelial tumors,34
only those that contained < 10% of a second malignant
component were considered “pure”; those which contained > 10% were considered “mixed.” Carcinoma and
normal human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines were
established from tissue biopsies and maintained as
described.35,36 Cellular growth rate was determined per
established protocol.37 Survival data were obtained
through review of electronic medical records and/or public records.
RNA Extraction, Purification, and Reverse
Transcription

Total RNA extraction from cell culture lysates and freshfrozen tissues was performed using AllPrep DNA/RNA/
Protein Minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, Md). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a 7500 RealTime PCR
System per the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). All RNA samples were treated
with Turbo DNase enzyme (Applied Biosystems). Total
RNA (5 lg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). Five microliters of reversetranscribed RNA was amplified using TaqMan PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Tubulin-b-III (Hs0096
4962_g1) and p-glycoprotein (Hs00184491_m1) specific
primers were obtained (Assay-On-Demand, Carlsbad,
2583

Original Article

Calif), with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Hs99999905_m1) as an internal control. Gene expression
was analyzed using the comparative threshold method and
normalized to levels observed in lymphoid cell lines.
Chemosensitivity and viability assays

Patupilone (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland), ixabepilone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), and paclitaxel (T7402: Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) as 10
mM stock solutions protected from light exposure and
stored at 220 C prior to serial dilution. Metabolic assays
were performed after drug exposure using MTS [3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)25-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)22(4-sulfophenyl)22H-tetrazolium] assays (Promega, Madison, Wis). Briefly, cells at log phase of growth were
seeded in 96-well culture plates at optimum density, incubated, and exposed to drug after 24 hours. Tetrazolium
was added after 72 hours of additional incubation. Absorbance at a reference wavelength of 490 nm was measured with a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif). For cell viability assays, cells at
log phase of growth were seeded in 6-well microtiter plates
at optimum density and exposed to drug at 24 hours. After 48 to 72 hours of additional incubation, well contents
were harvested in entirety, centrifuged, then stained with
either trypan blue for manual counts or propidium iodide
(2 lL of a 500 lg/mL stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% sodium azide and 2% fetal bovine
serum) for flow cytometric counts. Unless stated otherwise, all median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values
presented have been determined by flow cytometry.
Immunohistochemistry

All slides were reviewed by a gynecologic pathologist
(N.B.). Formalin-fixed sections were cut at 4 lm and
stained with anti-tubulin-b-III monoclonal antibody
(TUJ1; Covance, Berkeley, Calif) at 1:500 dilution.
Staining intensity was assessed using a semiquantitative
scoring system: 0, negative (no staining observed); 11,
focal/weak staining; 21, diffuse weak/focal moderate
staining; 31, diffuse moderate/focal strong staining; 41,
diffuse strong immunoreactivity. For mixed specimens,
only the serous component was examined.
Small Interfering RNA

Tubulin-b-II-specific (50 !30 GAUCAAUGCUGCAU
CCUUAtt) and tubulin-b-III-specific small interfering
RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides (50 !30 CCAUUCUGGUGGUGGACCUGGAtt) were purchased from
2584

Ambion (Silencer Select; Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
Calif). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 200,000 per well and transfected with siRNA
duplexes at 10 nM with 5 lL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) in OptiMem (Life Technologies) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mock transfections with nonspecific siRNA
duplexes were used as negative controls. Cells were
exposed to drug 24 hours after plating. Cells remained in
culture for a total of 72 hours prior to harvest.
Statistical Analyses

Dose-response curves were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif). IC50,absolute was defined as the concentration of drug required to
result in reduction of cell viability to 50% of untreated
control. IC50,relative was defined as the concentration at
50% between maximum and minimum points of the
dose-response curve. IC50 was determined through interpolation of sigmoidal curves fit with a standard Hill slope
of 21.0. Unless stated otherwise, all values presented
reflect IC50,absolute and mean 6 standard error of the
mean. Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed with the logrank test. All Student t tests and Pearson correlations
employed 2 tails and assumed equal variance. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney analyses were applied to examine
the distributions of IHC scores. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
USCs Overexpress Tubulin-b-III but Not pGlycoprotein in Fresh-Frozen Tissues and Cell
Lines by qRT-PCR

Fresh-frozen tissue specimens representing 28 USCs and
20 OSCs were analyzed. A total of 6 USC and 7 OSC primary cell lines were established. Source patient characteristics are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Mixed specimens all
contained endometrioid in addition to serous components; in one specimen, clear cell features were also present. USC overexpressed tubulin-b-III relative to OSC in
both fresh-frozen tissues (Fig. 1A; 552.9 6 106.7 versus
202.0 6 43.99, P 5 .01) and cell lines (Fig. 1B;
1701 6 376.4 versus 645.1 6 157.9, P 5 .02). Tubulinb-III expression in fresh-frozen tissues was greater for
patients with pure versus mixed histology (703.2 6 196.4
versus 403.4 6 72.57, P 5 .02; Fig. 1C). There was no
difference in tubulin-b-III expression among those with
early-stage versus advanced-stage disease (533.2 6 134.3
versus 595.8 6 183.3, P 5 .79; data not shown). Tubulin-b-III was not expressed at high levels in normal human

ovarian surface epithelial cell lines (133.3 6 22.37, n 5 3;
data not shown).
Compared with OSCs, USCs exhibited a trend toward higher p-glycoprotein expression in fresh-frozen tissues (Fig. 1D; 120.9 6 31.39 versus 39.22 6 15.82,
P 5 .05) and cell lines (Fig. 1E; 1005 6 455.4 versus
266.5 6 136.5, P 5 .15). The greater expression of both
tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein in cell lines compared
with fresh-frozen tissues is thought to reflect heterogeneity

stronger staining (median IHC score: 31) relative to
OSC (median IHC score: 0 to 11) (P 5 .004). The qRTPCR copy number among these specimens was
631.12 6 193.31 versus 92.98 6 25.53 (P 5 .01). Normal ovary and endometrium did not express tubulin-b-III
by IHC; this reflects qRT-PCR copy number among
unmatched normal ovary, endometrium, and myometrium (32.63 6 6.51, n 5 3). Representative slides and
distribution of IHC scores are shown in Figure 2.
USCs Are Highly Sensitive to Patupilone
Relative to OSCs

Next, we performed chemosensitivity profiling of 4 USC
and 3 OSC cell lines, which were selected given their similarity in growth rates, because this may influence response
to cytotoxic agents (mean doubling time 6 standard error
of the mean, USC versus OSC: 24.5 6 4.25 versus
35.0 6 8.5 hours, respectively, P 5 .28; data not shown).
USCs were found to be highly sensitive to patupilone. As
determined by flow cytometric assays of cell viability,
IC50 values for patupilone among 4 USC and 3 OSC cell
lines were 0.25 6 0.11 nM [range 5 0.02-0.53] and
2586

1.01 6 0.13 nM [range 5 0.81-1.24], respectively
(P 5 .006; Fig. 3). Corresponding IC50 values for paclitaxel were not significantly different (26.41 6 27.14
[range 5 48.42-182.52] versus 95.64 6 75.34 [range 5
4.89-65.52]; P 5 .14). Within these 7 cell lines, tubulinb-III expression was higher among USCs compared with
OSCs with a trend toward statistical significance (2297 6
462.2 versus 834.0 6 289.5, P 5 .058; Fig. 3, inset). pGlycoprotein expression was not significantly different
(P 5 .27; data not shown). Flow cytometric findings were
robust across both metabolic assays and manual counts by
trpyan blue exclusion. IC50 values determined by flow
cytometry are presented given superior sensitivity and
dynamic range of the assay; results of these independent
validation studies have been described previously (Roque
et al, unpublished data).

median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as determined by flow cytometry after exposure to drug for 72 hours in OSC (top)
and USC (bottom) cell lines are shown. IC50 values (mean 6 standard error of the mean) for patupilone among OSC and USC cell
lines are 1.01 6 0.12 and 0.25 6 0.11 nM, respectively (P 5.006). There was no statistical difference between IC50 values for paclitaxel or p-glycoprotein expression within the cells lines shown. Tubulin-b-III copy number was higher among USC compared to
OSC with a trend toward statistical significance (inset, top right).

(ie, USC-1 and USC-2). As representatively shown in
Figure 4 for USC-1, both USC cell lines tested demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity to patupilone and
ixabepilone when compared to paclitaxel. Indeed, as
determined by flow cytometric assays of cell viability,
IC50 values were 0.41 nM (range 5 0.3-0.55 nM) for
patupilone and 0.87 nM (range 5 0.58-1.27 nM) for
ixabepilone, respectively, whereas IC50 values were
2.12 nM (range 5 1.44-3.05 nM) for paclitaxel (paclitaxel versus patupilone: P 5 .003, paclitaxel versus ixabepilone P 5 .02, Fig. 4). In multiple parallel experiments,
we consistently noted higher sensitivity of USC cell lines
to patupilone when compared with ixabepilone
(P 5 .02, Fig. 4).
Chemoresistance of USCs to Paclitaxel and
Patupilone Varies With Tubulin-b-III Expression

We investigated the relationship of tubulin-b-III as a
marker of patupilone sensitivity and paclitaxel resistance in
USCs by plotting by qRT-PCR copy number against the
ratio of IC50,paclitaxel to IC50,patupilone (Fig. 5A; r2 5 0.8038,
P 5 .05). p-Glycoprotein expression in the USC (n 5 4)
and OSC (n 5 3) cell lines did not correlate with patupilone IC50 (R2 5 0.357, P 5 .16; data not shown). To
investigate the role of tubulin-b-III in paclitaxel and patupilone resistance, siRNAs were then used to downregulate
expression before exposure to drug. Transfection successfully produced reductions in tubulin-b-III of 83% to 93%,

chemotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 of 19
patients with advanced USC and 16 of 18 patients with
advanced OSC. Median OS was much worse for patients
with either pure USC (221 days) or mixed component

patients with high tubulin-b-III expression, 71% demonstrated pure histology compared with 44% in those with
low expression; however, this difference was not statistically different (P 5 .33). The hazard ratio for death was
3.929 (95% confidence interval 5 1.04-14.84). Within
this same group, no differences in OS were found between
patients with low and high p-glycoprotein expression
using a cutoff of 30 (Fig. 6C) (median OS: 268 versus
341 days, respectively, P 5 .69; hazard ratio 5 0.79, 95%
confidence interval 5 0.26-2.438). Among patients with

difference in distribution of patients with mixed and pure
histology (P 5 .31). Among the USC cohort, mean tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein copy numbers were 643.31
(range 5 150-2837) and 72.63 (range 5 9-304), respectively (Fig. 6D,E). Median follow-up interval in the
cohort was only 345 days, but only 2 patients remained
alive at time of last follow-up. In the OSC cohort, mean
tubulin-b-III and p-glycoprotein copy numbers were
212.59 (range 5 12-839) and 32.69 (range 5 1-118),
respectively; median follow-up was 693 days, and 9
patients were alive at time of censoring.
DISCUSSION
Although USCs and OSCs represent 2 morphologically
similar diseases often treated with identical chemotherapeutic regimens, they differ in their biologic pathogenesis
and clinical behavior. In accordance with this diversity,
we have shown for the first time using quantitative methods within a large number of fresh-frozen tissues and cell
lines that USCs overexpress tubulin-b-III relative to highgrade OSCs. We also demonstrate correlation between
qRT-PCR copy number and immunostaining. This validation is crucial because messenger RNA transcript copy
number and protein expression may be discordant due to
posttranscriptional modifications in mammalian cells.38

The pathways leading to chemoresistance in USC
are incompletely elucidated. A brisk growth rate likely
permits rapid tumor regrowth despite initial intrinsic sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.39 These tumors are
also associated with a distinct milieu of autocrine factors,
including upregulation of interleukin-6,40 which has been
shown to confer resistance to paclitaxel in gynecologic
malignancies.41 Although p-glycoprotein has been shown
in vitro to maintain low intracellular concentrations of
paclitaxel,33 expression has not shown to be clinically
meaningful for endometrial cancers.29,42,43 The design of
rational therapeutic strategies requires a more thorough
understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to resistance as well as isolation of novel prognostic markers
for response.
Tubulin-b-III has been proposed as a biomarker of
chemoresistance to paclitaxel44 as well as response to patupilone.37 In this study, USC exhibited greater tubulin-bIII expression and was 4.1-fold more sensitive (P 5 .006)
to patupilone relative to OSC cell lines, despite equal sensitivity to paclitaxel. Because chemosensitivity is multifactorial, the similar sensitivity to paclitaxel may reflect the
concurrent absence of differential p-glycoprotein expression across the uterine and ovarian serous cell lines tested.
Chemosensitivities were confirmed rigorously across
assays, on the basis of both cell viability (trypan blue
exclusion and flow cytometry) and metabolism (MTS
assay), because the latter methodology may be greatly
influenced by variables such as media composition.45
Given that heightened sensitivity to paclitaxel in response
to tubulin-b-III downregulation had not yet been demonstrated in USC cell lines, we used siRNA to reduce tubulin-b-III expression; consistent with previous studies, we
witnessed improved in vitro sensitivity of both USC and
OSC to paclitaxel by approximately 2-fold. Tubulin-b-III
downregulation has been previously shown to improve
sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents,46 including epothilone B47 by predisposing cells to apoptosis
through mechanisms other than reduction in mitotic
block induced by chemotherapeutic agent.46,47 The
results of our siRNA tubulin-b-III knockdown experiments in USC are in agreement with this view and suggest
that tubulin-b-III may not only serve as a marker for sensitivity to epothilones but also as a mediator of multiple
cell survival pathways.46,47
In this study, overexpression of tubulin-b-III had
prognostic relevance. Among patients with advancedstage disease, we have shown for the first time in USC that
tubulin-b-III copy number may identify patients who are
at risk of poorer OS. Consistent with prior publications,
2590

we found reduced OS in uterine cancers with increasing
volume of the serous component.48 Our findings differ
from the report by Vandenput et al29 and by Zhu et al,49
who failed to identify a relationship between tubulin-bIII expression and outcome in patients who had received
paclitaxel for endometrial cancer; however, their analyses
employed IHC alone.
Patupilone has shown encouraging activity in the
treatment of gynecologic malignancies, but has not been
tested beyond phase 2 trials in endometrial cancers.50,51
Ixabepilone, which differs from patupilone by a single moiety, has been evaluated in GOG-129P, a study of 50
patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer
who received one prior line of taxane-based chemotherapy
including 40% with serous and 2% with clear cell histology. An overall response rate of 12% was achieved using 40
mg/m2 every 21 days; disease stabilization for at least 8
weeks occurred in 60%. Median progression-free and overall survival was 2.9 months and 8.7 months, respectively.51
Among the various epothilones, patupilone was chosen for
most of our work because our institution previously participated in EPO2303, a multicenter phase 3 trial of patupilone versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in taxaneand/or platinum-refractory/resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In our study, an in vitro comparison alongside the sensitivity of USC cell lines to patupilone and ixabepilone
versus paclitaxel demonstrated a consistent higher sensitivity of USC to epothilones. Patupilone, however, had significantly higher potency against USC cell lines when
compared with ixabepilone. These results are consistent
with published reports comparing patupilone to ixabepilone activity against human colorectal cell lines.52
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that tubulinb-III overexpression in USC may discriminate poor
prognosis among patients with advanced disease, serves
as a marker for sensitivity to patupilone, and may contribute to paclitaxel resistance. IHC applied to surgical
specimens may be a reliable adjunct to identify tumors
with overexpression of tubulin-b-III, and accordingly,
the subset of individuals at risk of poor outcome in the
setting of platinum/taxane chemotherapy who may
instead respond to patupilone. Epothilones warrant further clinical investigation in the treatment of these
aggressive, chemoresistant tumors, especially in the setting of recurrent or persistent disease and high tubulinb-III expression.
