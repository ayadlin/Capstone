15-PGDH Expression in Cholangiocarcinoma Cells
by Inhibiting miR-26a/b Expression

Abstract
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a proinﬂammatory lipid mediator
that promotes cancer growth. The 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl
group of PGE2, leading to its inactivation. Therefore, 15-PGDH
induction may offer a strategy to treat cancers that are driven by
PGE2, such as human cholangiocarcinoma. Here, we report that
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-3 PUFA) upregulate
15-PGDH expression by inhibiting miR-26a and miR-26b, thereby contributing to w-3 PUFA-induced inhibition of human
cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. Treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma cells (CCLP1 and TFK-1) with w-3 PUFA (DHA)
or transfection of these cells with the Fat-1 gene (encoding
Caenorhabditis elegans desaturase, which converts w-6 PUFA to
w-3 PUFA) signiﬁcantly increased 15-PGDH enzymes levels, but
with little effect on the activity of the 15-PGDH gene promoter.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that this increase in 15-PGDH

Introduction
Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant cancer of the
biliary tract with poor prognosis (1–12). The incidence and
mortality of cholangiocarcinoma is rising worldwide and currently there is no effective chemoprevention or treatment. The
tumor often arises from background conditions that cause
long-standing inﬂammation, injury, and reparative biliary epithelial cell proliferation, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis,
clonorchiasis, hepatolithiasis, or complicated ﬁbropolycystic
diseases. Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma is also associated with hepatitis C viral infection and liver cirrhosis secondary to other nonbiliary causes. The carcinogenic processes
involve a series of sequential events, including chronic inﬂam-

levels in cells was mediated by a reduction in the expression of
miR-26a and miR-26b, which target 15-PGDH mRNA and inhibit
15-PGDH translation. These ﬁndings were extended by the demonstration that overexpressing miR-26a or miR-26b decreased
15-PGDH protein levels, reversed w-3 PUFA-induced accumulation of 15-PGDH protein, and prevented w-3 PUFA-induced
inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. We further
observed that w-3 PUFA suppressed miR-26a and miR-26b
by inhibiting c-myc, a transcription factor that regulates miR26a/b. Accordingly, c-myc overexpression enhanced expression of
miR-26a/b and ablated the ability of w-3 PUFA to inhibit cell
growth. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism
for w-3 PUFA-induced expression of 15-PGDH in human
cholangiocarcinoma and provide a preclinical rationale for the
evaluation of w-3 PUFA in treatment of this malignancy. Cancer Res;

mation, cholangiocyte proliferation, dysplasia, and ultimately
malignant transformation.
Consistent with the strong association between bile duct chronic inﬂammation and cholangiocarcinogenesis, compelling evidence (10, 13–28) has shown that mediators of inﬂammation,
such as prostaglandins, play an important role in cholangiocarcinogenesis. For example, elevated expression of COX-2 has been
documented in cholangiocarcinoma cells and precancerous bile
duct lesions, but not in normal bile duct epithelial cells (21–25);
the expression of COX-2 is induced by proinﬂammatory cytokines
as well as bile acids (29, 30). Overexpression of COX-2 in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells enhances prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and promotes tumor growth, whereas depletion of COX2 reduces PGE2 production and prevents growth (14, 15). PGE2
treatment is known to increase cholangiocarcinoma cell growth
and prevent apoptosis (13–15, 26–28). Accordingly, inhibition of
COX-2 by molecular and pharmacologic approaches prevents the
growth and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and in
animal models (10, 14, 15, 22, 25, 27, 28). These ﬁndings provide
important preclinical evidence for targeting COX-2 in prevention
and treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma. However, as some
COX-2 inhibitors are known to be associated with increased
cardiovascular side effect (31–34), there is an urgent and practical
need to identify COX-2 downstream target for effective anticholangiocarcinoma therapy with fewer side effects.
The amount of biologically active PGE2 in the inﬂammatory
and tumor microenvironment is regulated by the balance between
PGE2 synthesis and degradation. Although previous studies have
focused on the role of COX-2 in carcinogenesis, the role of PGE2

w-3 PUFAs Upregulate the Expression of 15-PGDH in Cholangiocarcinoma

degradation enzyme, the NADþ-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), has not been recognized until recently. 15-PGDH catalyzes oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of
PGE2, converting PGE2 into 15-keto-PGE2; this enzymatic reaction leads to reduction of the proinﬂammatory and protumorigenic PGE2 (35). Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that 15PGDH is an important tumor suppressor in a number of human
cancers, including cholangiocarinoma (36).
Although the proinﬂammatory and procarcinogenic prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA), a w-6 PUFA;
this process is competitively inhibited by w-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (w-3 PUFAs). The lipid mediators derived from w-6 and
w-3 PUFA are metabolically distinct and often have opposing
physiologic and pathologic functions; for example, w-6 PUFAderived eicosanoids tend to promote inﬂammation and carcinogenesis, whereas w-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators largely inhibit
inﬂammation and prevent carcinogenesis (or less promotional
for inﬂammation and proliferation). In this study, we report that
w-3 PUFA (but not w-6 PUFA) upregulates the expression of 15PGDH by inhibiting miR-26a and miR-26b in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. We show that 15-PGDH is a bona ﬁde target of
miR-26a and miR-26b. Our ﬁndings provide novel evidence for
w-3 PUFA-regulated miR-26a/b and 15-PGDH cascade and support w-3 PUFA as a nontoxic therapeutic agent for the treatment of
human cholangiocarcinoma.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and AA were purchased from
Cayman Chemical. miR-26a and miR-26b lentiviral particles were
purchased from GeneCopoeia. 15-PGDH 30 untranslated region
(UTR)–luciferase reporter was obtained from ORIGENE. Rabbit
polyclonal antibody against 15-PGDH was purchased from Cayman chemical. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against c-myc was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal
antibodies against CTDSPL and CTDSP1 were purchased from
Abcam. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against b-actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. siRNA against 15-PGDH was synthesized by ORIGENE. NOD CB17-prkdc/SCID mice were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in Tulane transgenic
mice facility according to the protocol approved by the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All
primers used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA
Technologies (Supplementary Table S1). All chemical reagents
were analytic grades (Sigma).
Cell culture
Two human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, CCLP1 and
TFK-1, were used in this study. TFK-1 cells (37) were obtained
from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank where the
cell line was tested and authenticated by DNA ﬁngerprinting,
isozyme detection, cell vitality assay, and mycoplasma detection.
Authentication of CCLP1 cells (38) was based on morphologic
features, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural analysis, and
cytogenetic analysis, and the cells were cultured as we previously described (14, 17, 19). The TFK-1 and CCLP1 were
maintained in RPMI-1640 and DMEM culture medium, respectively. All culture medium were supplemented with 10% (v/v)
FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were
cultured at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5%

CO2. All cell lines were used at low passage number not
exceeding 30 passages.
Stable cell lines
CCLP1 and TFK-1 cells were transfected with Fat-1 expression
plasmid or control vector pcDNA3 and then maintained in
complete culture medium with 0.2 mg/mL puromycin (Life
Technology). CCLP1 and TFK-1 cells were also infected with
miR-26a/b lentivirus or miRNA-scramble control and the cells
were maintained in culture medium with 0.2 mg/mL Geneticin
(Life Technologies). Medium is replaced every 3 days for 2 to 4
weeks until outgrowth of resistant cells. The resistant cells were
harvested and maintained in culture media with selection
agents for further use.
Gene-expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted according to the TRIzol Reagent
method (Life Technologies). mRNA levels were quantiﬁed by
using the RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Kit (QIAGEN); GAPDH is
measured as a reference gene. miRNA levels were quantiﬁed by
using the miScript Primer Assays Kit (QIAGEN); U6 is measured
as a reference gene. Primers used are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. For Western blotting analyses, whole-cell lysate were
prepared by using RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitor
cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Cellular proteins were separated by SDSPAGE electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked by
PBS-T (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk for
1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated with individual
primary antibodies in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk for 2 to 5
hours at room temperature with the dilutions speciﬁed by the
manufacturers. Following three washes with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with IRDye 680LT/IRDye 800CW secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) in PBS-T for 1 hour room
temperature. The membranes were then washed with PBS-T and
the protein bands were visualized by using the ODYSSEY infrared
imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Dual-luciferase reporter assay
Cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter (15-PGDH
promoter-luciferase, 15-PGDH 30 UTR-luciferase) and pRL-TK (Promega). pRL-TK provides the constitutive expression of Renilla
luciferase that was used as an internal control. Seventy-two hours
after transfection, cells were collected and passively lysed. Luciferase
activities in the extracts were measured by DLReady Centro XS3
LB960 luminometer with the use of Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
Kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured against Renilla
luciferase activity for transfection efﬁciency.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes.
Chromosome DNA was extracted according to the protocol
provided by SimpleChIP Assay Kits (Cell Signaling Technology)
and precipitated by using speciﬁc c-myc Rabbit polyclone antibody. Rabbit polyclone antibody Histone 3 was used as positive
control whereas Rabbit IgG was used as negative control. Regular
PCR procedure (5 minutes at 94 C, followed by 30 cycles of 30
seconds at 94 C, 30 seconds at 55 C, 30 seconds at 72 C, ended
by 10 minutes at 72 C) was adopted to amplify c-myc–binding
site sequence. Primers were listed in Supplementary Table S1.

v-3 PUFAs induces 15-PGDH expression in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells
We compared the effect of w-3 PUFA (DHA) versus w-6 PUFA
(AA) on 15-PGDH expression in human cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines (CCLP1 and TFK-1). Although DHA treatment increased the

level of 15-PGDH protein, AA treatment exhibited no effect
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). In separate experiments,
we stably transfected CCLP1 and TFK-1 cells with vector expressing the Fat-1 gene (which encodes a C. elegans w-3 fatty-acid
desaturase converting w-6 to w-3 fatty acids; ref. 39). Overexpression of the Fat-1 gene was also found to increase 15-PGDH
protein expression; the effect of Fat-1 gene transfection on 15PGDH is comparable with DHA treatment of control cells
(Fig. 1B). In addition, the levels of 15-PGDH mRNA were also
elevated in DHA-treated or Fat-1–overexpressed cells (Fig. 1C).

DHA treatment or Fat-1 expression did not alter 15-PGDH promoter activity, as reﬂected by the 15-PGDH promoter luciferase
assay (Fig. 1D).
v-3 PUFAs suppress miR-26a/b and prevent their targeting of
15-PGDH in cholangiocarcinoma cells
As w-3 PUFA increased 15-PGDH protein and mRNA levels
without induction of 15-PGDH promoter activity, we reasoned
that w-3 PUFA might regulate 15-PGDH gene expression through
posttranscriptional mechanism. We directed out attention to
microRNAs, which could potentially bind to the 15-PGDH 30 UTR.
Sequence analysis identiﬁed four conserved microRNAs (miR26a, miR-26b, miR-1297, and miR-4465) that are complementary
to the 15-PGDH 30 UTR (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Among these four microRNAs, miR-26a and miR-26b were found
to be highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma cells relative to the
other two (miR-1297 and miR-4465; Supplementary Fig. S2). We
next performed qRT-PCR analysis to determine whether w-3
PUFAs might alter the expression of these miRNAs. As shown
in Fig. 2B and C, DHA treatment or Fat-1 overexpression decreased
the levels of miR-26a and miR-26b, but not the other two miRNAs
(miR-1297 and miR-4465). These ﬁndings suggest that w-3 PUFA
may induce 15-PGDH expression through alteration of miR-26a
and/or miR-26b.

www.aacrjournals.org

To further determine the effect of miR-26a and miR-26b on 15PGDH, we infected human cholangiocarcinoma cells with lentivirus particles carrying miR-26a (green) or miR-26b gene
(red; Fig. 2D); these cells were then analyzed for 15-PGDH protein
expression. As shown in Fig. 2E, overexpression of miR-26a or
miR-26b signiﬁcantly reduced 15-PGDH protein in both
CCLP1 and TFK-1 cells and the effects were reversed by antimiR-26. We next measured the 15-PGDH 30 UTR luciferase
reporter activities in miR-26a or miR-26b overexpressed or
control cells. As shown in Fig. 2F, miR-26a or miR-26b overexpression decreased the 15-PGDH 30 UTR luciferase reporter
activity; this effect was abolished when the miR-26a/b–binding
sites were mutated. These results establish 15-PGDH as a direct
target of miR-26a/b. Accordingly, we observed that overexpression of miR-26a or miR-26b prevented DHA-induced 15PGDH protein accumulation (Fig. 2G).
Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that w-3 PUFAs induce 15PGDH protein accumulation through suppression of miR-26a/b
in human cholangiocarcinoma cells.

phosphatase) gene family (illustrated in Fig. 3A; refs. 40, 41).
Given that the expression of miR-26a/b is reported to be
concomitant with their host genes (40), we measured the
mRNA level of CTDSPs (CTDSPL and CTDSP1) in cholangiocarcinoma cells treated with w-3 PUFA. Our data showed that
the w-3 PUFA DHA suppressed the expression of both CTDSPL
and CTDSP1, whereas the w-6 PUFA AA had no effect (Fig. 3B).
The pattern of CTDSPL and CTDSP1 alterations appears to be
similar to their intronic microRNAs, suggesting that miR-26a/b
and their host genes are coregulated by w-6 PUFA in cholangiocarcinoma cells.
The expression of CTDSPs is well known to be associated
with the transcription factor c-myc. Given that c-myc is a

1394 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

downstream gene of Wnt signaling (42–44) and that w-3 PUFA
suppresses the Wnt pathway (45, 46), we sought to further
examine whether c-myc might be implicated in w-3 PUFAmediated suppression of CTDSPs/miR-26s. Our data showed
that DHA treatment decreased c-myc along with reduction of
CTDSPs/miR-26s (Fig. 3C and D). Importantly, DHA-induced
reduction of CTDSPs/miR-26s was partially revered by overexpression of c-myc (Fig. 3C and D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that c-myc was associated
with the promoters of the CTDSPL/miR-26a and CTDSP1/
miR-26b gene clusters (Fig. 3E). These ﬁndings suggest that
w-3 PUFA regulates the expression of miR-26a/b at least in part
through c-myc.

Overexpression of miR-26a prevents Fat-1–induced inhibition
of cholangiocarcinoma growth
To further determine the role of miR-26/15-PGDH in w-3
PUFA-induced inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth, we
evaluated the growth parameters of tumor cells overexpressing
Fat1 and/or miR-26a. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, overexpression of
miR-26a abolished Fat-1–induced inhibition of CCLP1 cell
growth and colony formation, in vitro. TUNEL assay showed that
Fat-1–induced CCLP1 cell apoptosis was partially reversed by
miR-26a overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S3; this result is
consistent with our previous report that w-3 PUFAs inhibit cholangiocarcinoma predominantly through induction of apoptosis;
ref. 19). Our further Western blotting analysis conﬁrmed that
miR-26a overexpression attenuated Fat-1–induced induction of
15-PGDH (Fig. 4C).
We then inoculated CCLP1 cells with or without Fat-1 and/or
miR-26a overexpression subcutaneously into SCID mice to monitor tumor growth in vivo. Although Fat-1 expression inhibited
xenograft tumor growth, overexpression of miR-26a enhanced
tumor growth and offset the inhibitory effect of Fat-1 (Fig. 5A and
B). Western blotting analysis using the recovered xenograft tumor
tissues conﬁrmed that miR-26a overexpression attenuated Fat-1–
induced induction of 15-PGDH in vivo (Fig. 5C).
Knockdown of 15-PGDH prevents v-3 PUFA-induced
inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma growth
To further determine the role of 15-PGDH in w-3 PUFAinduced inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma growth, we constructed cells with Fat-1 overexpressing plus 15-PGDH knockdown. By using siRNA approach, we were able to satisfactorily
reduce 15-PGDH protein in normal or Fat-1–expressed CCLP1
cells (Fig. 6A). We observed that knockdown of 15-PGDH revered

Fat-1–induced inhibition of CCLP1 cell proliferation and colony
formation, in vitro (Fig. 6B and C). We next performed in vivo
experiments to evaluate the effect of w-3 PUFAs and 15-PGDH on
cholangiocarcinoma growth in SCID mice. We observed that
administration of exogenous DHA to SCID mice signiﬁcantly
decreased tumor growth when the mice were inoculated with
control vector tumor cells and that 15-PGDH knockdown reversed
DHA effect in vivo (Fig. 7). These ﬁndings provide in vitro and in
vivo evidences for an important role of 15-PGDH in w-3 PUFAinduced inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth.

Discussion
This study provides the ﬁrst evidence that w-3 PUFAs upregulate
the expression of 15-PGDH by inhibiting miR-26a and miR-26b
and that these effects contribute to w-3 PUFA-induced inhibition
of cholangiocarcinoma growth. Our ﬁndings support that w-3
PUFA may be used as a nontoxic adjuvant therapeutic agent for
the treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma. The signiﬁcance of
the study is further underscored by the fact that cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant human cancer currently with no
effective therapy.
Previous studies have shown that w-3 PUFAs inhibit the growth
of tumor cells, although they are signiﬁcantly less toxic toward
normal cells (47, 48). For cells of biliary origin, we have shown that
w-3 PUFAs inhibit the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells but not
primary biliary epithelial cells (19). Thus, w-3 PUFA may represent
a nontoxic therapeutic agent for treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma. Several mechanisms for w-3 PUFA as a cancer therapeutic agent have been documented (49). Our previous study has
shown that w-3 PUFAs inhibit cholangiocarcinoma cell growth in
part through inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin and COX-2 signaling

pathways (19). This study describes a separate novel mechanism,
miR-26a/b-mediated regulation of 15-PGDH, in w-3 PUFA-mediated inhibition of human cholangiocarcinoma. It is notable that
15-PGDH, a key enzyme that catalyzes PGE2 oxidation, is an
important tumor suppressor regulated by w-3 PUFA. Our results
show that w-3 PUFA upregulates 15-PGDH expression in cholangiocarcinoma cells and this effect contributes to inhibition of
cholangiocarcinoma growth, in vitro and in vivo.
The mechanisms for 15-PGDH–mediated inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma growth include deactivation of PGE2, a proinﬂammatory and protumorigenic lipid mediator, which is known
to promote tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis (10). In
parallel, 15-PGDH catalyzes the biotransformation of PGE2 to 15keto-PGE2, which is known to activate peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor g (PPARg) and Smad2/3, leading to induction
of TAp63 and inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth (36).
It is possible that all of these mechanisms may be implicated in
w-3 PUFA-induced inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth.
Our ﬁndings present in this study suggest that induction of 15PGDH by w-3 PUFA may represent an effective therapeutic target
for cholangiocarcinoma. Because the cardiovascular side effect
associated with COX-2 inhibitors is largely due to inhibition
of the antithrombotic prostacyclin (PGI2), induction or reaction

1396 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

of 15-PGDH is expected to block cholangiocarcinoma growth
without inhibiting PGI2 and thus incurring no signiﬁcant side
effect. In this context, the results presented in this study are
expected to have signiﬁcant impact for future management of
cholangiocarcinoma.
Another novel aspect of this study is the illustration of miR-26a/
b as a key factor linking w-3 PUFA to 15-PGDH. We show that w-3
PUFA inhibits the expression of miR-26a/b, thus leading to 15PGDH protein accumulation. Direct targeting of 15-PGDH by
miR-26a/b was demonstrated by the observations that miR-26a/b
inhibits 15-PGDH 30 UTR luciferase reporter activity and that miR26a/b overexpression prevents w-3 PUFA-induced 15-PGDH protein accumulation. We noted that knockdown of 15-PGDH did
not reverse cholangiocarcinoma growth as potently as miR-26a
overexpression; this aspect may be explained by the facts that miR26s enhance Wnt/b-catenin signaling via inhibiting GSK-3b, and
that GSK-3b is another target of w-3 PUFA (19, 50). Thus, the data
presented in this study, along with our previous ﬁndings, suggest
that there are two targets, 15-PGDH and GSK-3b, which can be
regulated by w-3 PUFA/miR-26s in human cholangiocarcinoma
cells. The interplays between PGE2 and Wnt/b-catenin signaling
pathways and their regulation by w-3 PUFA are illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. S4.
Although c-myc is a downstream oncogene of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling, it is also the cofactor regulating the gene clusters formed
by miR-26a/b and their host CTDSPs genes (40–43). Our data
presented in this study suggest that w-3 PUFA suppress miR-26a
and miR-26b by inhibiting c-myc, through regulation of their host
genes CTDSPs. The latter assertion is further supported by the
ChIP assay showing that c-myc is associated with the promoters of
the CTDSPL/miR-26a and CTDSP1/miR-26b gene clusters and by
the observation that overexpression of c-myc prevents w-3 PUFAinduced reduction of CTDSPs/miR-26s.
In summary, this study provides novel evidence for induction
15-PGDH by w-3 PUFA via suppression of miR-26s in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells. Our ﬁndings further support the use of
w-3 PUFA as nontoxic adjuvant therapeutic agent for the treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma.
